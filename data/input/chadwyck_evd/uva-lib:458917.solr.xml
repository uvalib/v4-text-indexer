      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus Scæna Prima. Enter Vitelli, Lamorall, Anastro. Vitelli. Alvarez pardon'd? Ana. And return'd. Lamo. I saw him land At St. Lucars, and such a generall welcome Fame, as harbinger to his brave actions, Had with the easie people, prepard for him, As if by his command alone, and fortune Holland with those low Provinces, that hold out Against the Arch-Duke, were again compel'd With their obedience to give up their lives To be at his devotion. Vit. You amaze me, For though I have heard, that when he fled from Civill To save his life (then forfeited to Law For murthering Don Pedro my deer Uncle) His extreame wants inforc'd him to take pay In th'Army sat down then before Ostena, 'Twas never yet reported, by whose favour He durst presunt to entertain a thought Of comming home with pardon. Ana. 'Tis our nature Or not to hear, or not to give beliefe To what we wish far from our enemies. Lam. Sir 'tis most certaine the Infantas letters Assisted by the Arch Dukes, to King Philip Have not alone secur'd him from the rigor Of our Castillian Justice, but return'd him A free man, and in grace. Vit. By what curs'd meanes Could such a fugitive arise unto The knowledge of their highnesses? much more (Though known) to stand but in the least degree Of favour with them? Lam. To give satisfaction To your demand, though to praise him I hate, Can yeild me small contentment, I will tell you, And truly, since should I detract his worth, 'Twould argue want of merit in my self. Briefly, to passe his tedious pilgrimage For sixteene years, a banish'd guilty-man, And to forget the stormes, th'affrights, the horrors His constancy, not fortune overcame, I bring him, with his little son, grown man (Though 'twas said here he took a daughter with him) To Ostends bloody seige that stage of war Wherein the flower of many Nations acted, And the whole Christian world spectators were; There by his son, or were he by adoption Or nature his, a brave Scene was presented, Which I make choyce to speak of, since from that The good successe of Alvarez, had beginning. Vil. So I love vertue in an enemy That I desire in the relation of This young mans glorious deed, you'ld keep your self A friend to truth, and it. Lam. Such was my purpose; The Town being oft assaulted, but in vaine, To dare the prow'd defendants to a sally, Weary of ease Don Inigo Peralta Son to the Generall of our Castile forces All arm'd, advanc'd within shot of their wals, From whence the muskateers plaid thick upon him, Yet he (brave youth) as carelesse of the danger, As carefull of his honor, drew his sword, And waving it about his head, as if He dar'd one spirited like himself, to triall Of single valor, he made his retreat With such a slow, and yet majestique pace, As if he still cald low'd, dare none come on? When sodainly from a posterne of the town Two gallant horse-men issued, and o're-took him, The army looking on, yet not a man That durst relieve the rash adventurer, Which Lucio, son to Alvarez then seeing, As in the vant-guard he sat bravely mounted, Or were it pity of the youths misfortune, Care to preserve the honour of his Country, Or bold desire to get himselfe a name, He made his brave horse, like a whirle wind bear him, Among the Combatants: and in a moment Dischar'd his Petronell, with such sure aime That of the adverse party from his horse, One tumbled dead, then wheeling round, and drawing A faulchion swift as lightning, he came on Upon the other, and with one strong blow In view of the amazed Town, and Campe He strake him dead, and brought Peralta off With double honour to himselfe. Vit. 'Twas brave: But the successe of this? Lam. The Campe receiv'd him With acclamations of joy and welcome, And for addition to the faire reward Being a massy chain of gold given to him By yong Peralta's Father, he was brought To the Infantas presence kiss'd her hand, And from that Lady, (greater in her goodnesse Then her high birth) had this encouragement Go on youngman; yet not to feed thy valour With hope of recompence to come, from me, For present satisfaction of what's past, Aske any thing that's fit for me to give, And thee to take, and be assur'd of it. Ana. Excellent princesse. Vit. And stil'd worthily The heart bloud, nay the soule of Souldiers. But what was his request? Lam. That the repeale Of Alvarez, makes plaine: he humbly begd His Fathers pardon, and so movingly Told the sad story of your uncles death That the Infanta wept, and instantly Granting his suit, working the Arch-duke to it, Their Letters were directed to the King, With whom they so prevaild, that Alvarez Was freely pardon'd. Uit. 'Tis not in the King To make that good. Ana. Not in the King? what subject Dares contradict his power? Uit. In this I dare, And wil: and not call his prerogative In question, nor presume to limit it. I know he is the Master of his Lawes, And may forgive the forfeits made to them, But not the injury done to my honour; And since (forgeting my brave Uncles merits And many services, under Duke D' Alva) He suffers him to fall, wrestling from Justice The powerfull sword, that would revenge his death, I'le fill with this Astrea's empty hand, And in my iust wreake, make this arme the Kings, My deadly hate to Alvarz, and his house, Which as I grew in years, hath still encreas'd, As if it cal'd on time to make me man, Slept while it had no object for her fury But a weak woman, and her talk'd of Daughter: But now, since there are quarries, worth her sight Both in the father, and his hopefull son, I'le boldly cast her off, and gorge her full With both their hearts: to further which your friendship, And oathes will your assistance, let your deedes Make answer to me; uselesse are all words Till you have writ performance with your Swords. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Bobadilla, and Lucio Luc. Go fetch my work: this ruffe was not well starch'd, So tell the maid, 'thas too much blew in it, And look you that the Partrich and the Pullen Have cleane meat, and fresh water, or my Mother Is like to hear on't. Bob. O good Sir Iaques helpe me: was there ever such an Hermaphrodite heard of? would any wench living, that should hear and see what I do, be wrought to believe, that the best of a man lies under this Petticoate, and that a Cod-peece were far fitter here, then a pind-Placket? Luc. You had best talk filthily: do; I have a tongue To tell my Mother, as well as ears to heare Your ribaldry. Bob. May you have ten womens tongues that way I am sure: why my yong Mr. or Mistris, Madam, Don or what you wil, what the devill have you to do with Pullen, or Partrich? or to sit pricking on a clowt all day? you have a better needle, I know, and might make better work, if you had grace to use it. Luc. Why, how dare you speak this before me, firha? Bob. Nay rather, why dare not you do what I speak? —though my Lady your mother, for fear of Vitelli and his faction, hath brought you up like her daughter, and h'as kept you this 20 year, which is ever since you were born, a close prisoner within dores, yet since you are a man, and are as wel provided as other men are, methinks you should have the same motions of the flesh, as other Cavaliers of us are inclin'd unto. Luc. Indeed you have cause to love those wanton motions, They having hope you to an excellent whipping, For doing something, I but put you in mind of it, With the Indian mayd, the governour sent my mother From Mexico. Bob. Why, I but taught her a Spanish trick in charity, and holp the King to a subject that may live to take grave Maurice prisoner, and that was more good to the State, then a thousand such as you are ever like to do: and wil tell you, (in a fatherly care of the Infant I speak it) if he live (as blesse the babe, in passion I remember him) to your years, shall he spend his time in pinning, painting, purling, and perfuming as you do? no, he shall to the wars, use his Spanish Pike, though with the danger of the lash, as his father has done, and when he is provoked, as I am now, draw his Toledo desperatly, as— Luc. You will not Kill me? oh. Bob. I knew this would silence him: how he hids his eys? If he were a wench now, as he seems, what an advantage Had I, drawing two Toledos, when one can do this? But oh me, my Lady: I must put up: young Master I did but jest: O custom, what ha'st thou made of him? Enter Eugenia, and Servants. Eug. For bringing this, be still my friend; no more A servant to me. Bob. What's the matter? Eug. Here, Even here where I am happy to receive Assurance of my Alvarez returne, I wil kneell down: and may those holy thoughts That now possesse me wholy, make this place a Temple to me, where I may give thanks For this unhop'd for blessing Heavens Kind hand Hath pour'd upon me. Luc. Let my duty Madam Presume, if you have cause of joy, to entreat I may share in it. Bob. 'Tis well, he has forgot how I frighted him yet. Eug. Thou shalt: but first kneel with me Lucio, No more Posthumina now, thou hast a Father, A Father living to take off that name, Which my too credulous fears, that he was dead, Bestow'd upon thee: thou shalt see him Lucio, And make him young again, by seeing thee, Who only hadst a being in my Womb When he went from me, Lucio: O my joyes, So far transport me, that I must forget The ornaments of Matrons, modesty, And grave behaviour; but let all forgive me If in th'expression of my soules best comfort Though old, I do a while forget mine age, And play the wanton in the entertinement Of those delights I have so long despair'd of. Luc. Shall I then see my Father? Eug. This houre Lucio; Which reckon the begining of thy life I mean that life, in which thou shalt appeare To be such as I brought thee forth: a man, This womanish disguise, in which I have So long conceal'd thee, thou shalt now cast off, And change those qualities thou didst learn from me, For masculine virtues, for which seek no tutor, But let thy fathers actions be thy precepts; And for thee Zancho, now expect reward For thy true service. Bob. Shall I? you hear fellow Stephano, learne to know me more respectively; how do'st thou think I shall become the Stewards chaire ha? will not these slender hanches show well with a chaine, and a gold night-Cap after supper when I take the accompts? Eug. Haste, and take down those blacks, with which my chamber Hath like the widow, her sad Mistris, mourn'd, And hang up for it, the rich Persian arras, Us'd on my wedding night: for this to me Shall be a second marriage: send for Musique, And will the 'cooks to use their best of cunning To please the palat. Bob. Will your Ladiship have a Potato-pie, tis a good stirring dish for an old Lady, after a long Lent. Eug. Be gon I say: why sir, you can go faster? Bob. I could Madam: but I am now to practise the Stewards pace, that's the reward I look for: every man must fashion his gate, according to his calling: you fellow Stephano, may walk faster, to overtake preferment: so, usher me. Luc. Pray Madam, let the wascoat I last wrought Be made up for my Father: I wil have A cap and boote-hose sutable to it. Eug. Of that Wee'l think hereafter Lucio: our thoughts now Must have no object, but thy Fathers welcome, To which thy helfe— Luc. With humble gladnesse Madam. Exeunt Scæna Tertia. Enter Alvarez, Clara. Alv. Where lost we Syavedra? Cla. He was met Entring the City by some Gentlemen Kinsmen, as he said of his own, with whom For complement sake (for so I think he term'd it) He was compel'd to stay: though I much wonder A man that knowes to do, and has done well In the head of his troop, when the bold foe charg'd home, Can learn so sodainly to abuse his time In apish entertainment: for my part (By all the glorious rewards of war) I had rather meet ten enemies in the field All sworn to fetch my head, then be brought on To change an houres discourse with one of these Smooth City fools, or rissen Cavaliers, Then only Gallans, as they wisely think, To get a Jewell, or a wanton Kisse From a Court-lip, though painted. Alv. My Love Clara (For Lucio is a name thou must forget With Lucios bold behaviour) though thy breeding I'the camp may plead something in the excuse Of thy rough manners, custome having chang'd, Though not thy Sex, the softnesse of thy nature, And fortune (then a cruell stepdame to thee) Impos'd upon thy tender sweetnesse, burthens Of hunder, cold, wounds, want, such as would crack The sinewes of a man, not borne a Souldier: Yet now she smiles, and like a naturall mother Looks gently on thee, Clara, entertaine Her proffer'd bounties with a willing bosome; Thou shalt no more have need to use thy sword; Thy beauty (which even Belgia hath not alter'd) Shall be a stronger guard, to keep my Clara, Then that has bin, (though never us'd but nobly) And know thus much. Cla. Sir, I know only that It stands not with my duty to gaine-say you, In any thing: I must, and will put on What fashion you think best: though I could wish I were what I appeare. Alv. Endeavour rather Musick. To be what you are, Clara, entring here As you were borne, a woman. Enter Eugnia, Lucio, Servants. Eug. Let choice Musick In the best voyce that ere touch'd humane eare, For joy hath tide my tongue up, speak your welcome. Alv. My soule, (for thou giv'st new life to my spirit) Myriads of joyes, though short in number of Thy vertues, fall on thee; Oh my Eugenia, Th'assurance, that I do embrace thee, makes My twenty years of sorrow but a dreame, And by the Nectar, which I take from these, I feele my age restor'd, and like old Æson Grow young againe. Eug. My Lord, long wish'd for welcome, Tis a sweet briefnesse, yet in that short word All pleasures which I may call mine, begin, And may they long increase, before they finde A second period: let mine eyes now surfet On this so wish'd for object, and my lips Yet modestly pay back the parting kisse You trusted with them, when you fled from Civill With little Clara my sweet daughter: lives she? Yet I coul'd chide my selfe, having you here For being so coveteous of all joyes at once, 'T enquire for her, you being alone, to me My Clara, Lucio, my Lord, my selfe, Nay more then all the world. Alv. As you, to me are. Eug. Sit down, and let me feed upon the story Of your past dangers, now you are here in safety It will give rellish, and fresh appetite To my delights, if such delights can cloy me. Yet do not Alvarez, let me first yeild you Accompt of my life in your absence, and Make you acquainted how I have preserv'd The Jewell left lock'd up in my womb, When you, in being forc'd to leave your country, Suffer'd a civill death. within Clashing swords. Alv. Doe my Eugenia, Tis that I most desire to heare, Eug. Then know Sayavedra within. Alv. What voyce is that? If you are noble Enemies, Vitelli within. Oppresse me not with odds, but kill me fairely, Stand off, I am too many of my selfe. Enter Bobadilla. Bob. Murther, murther murther, your friend my Lord, Don Syavedra is set upon in the Streets, by your enemies Vitelli, and his Faction: I am almost kill'd with looking on them. Alv. Ile free him, or fall with him: draw thy sword And follow me. Cla. Fortune I give thee thankes For this occasion once more to use it. Bob. Nay, hold not me Madam; if I doe any hurt, hang me. Exit. Luc. Oh I am dead with feare! let's flye into Your Closet, Mother. Eug. No houre of my life Secure of danger? heav'n be mercifull, Or now at once dispatch me. Enter Vitelli, pursued by Alvarez, &amp; Sayavedra, Clara beating of Anastro. Cla. Follow him Leave me to keepe these off. Alv. Assault my friend So neere by house? Vit. Nor in it will spare thee, Though 'twere a Temple: &amp; Ile mak it one, I being the Priest, and thou the sacrifice, Ile offer to my uncle. Alv. Haste thou to him, And say I sent thee: Cla. 'Twas put bravely by, And that: and yet comes on, and boldly rare, In the warres, where emulation and example Joyn to encrease the courage, and make lesse The danger; valour, and true resolution Never appear'd so lovely: brave againe: Sure he is more then man, and if he fall; The best of vertue, fortitude would dye with him: And can I suffer it? forgive me duty, So I love valour, as I will protect it Against my Father, and redeeme it, though 'Tis forfeited by one I hate. Vit. Come on, All is not lost yet: You shall buy me deerer Before you have me: keep off. Cla. Feare me not, Thy worth has tooke me Prisoner, and my sword For this time knowes thee onely for a friend, And to all else I turne the point of it. Say. Defend your Fathers Enemy? Alv. Art thou mad? Cla. Are you men rather? shall that valour, which Begot you lawfull honour in the warres, Prove now the parent of an infamous Bastard So foule, yet so long liv'd, as murther will Be to your shames? have each of you, alone With your own dangers onely, purchas'd glory From multitudes of Enemies, not allowing Those neerest to you, to have part in it, And doe you now joyn, and lend mortall helpe Against a single opposite? hath the mercy Of the great King, but newly wash'd away The blood, that with the forfeit of your life Cleav'd to your name, and family like an ulcer, In this againe to set a deeper dye Upon your infamy? you'll say he is your foe, And by his rashnesse call'd on his own ruine; Remember yet, he was first wrong'd, and honour Spur'd him to what he did, and next the place Where now he is, your house, which by the lawes Of hospitable duty should protect him; Have you been twenty yeeres a stranger to it, To make your entrance now in blood? or think, you Your country-man, a true born Spaniard, will be An offring fit, to please the genius of it? No, in this i'le presume to teach my Father, And this first Act of disobedience shall Confirme I am most dutifull. Alv. I am pleas'd With what I dare not give allowance to; Unnaturall wretch, what wilt thou doe? Cla. Set free A noble Enemy: come not on, by— You passe to him, through me: the way is open: Farwell: when next I meet you, doe not look for A friend, but a vow'd foe; I see you worthy, And therefore now preserve you, for the honour Of my sword onely: Vit. Were this man a friend, How would he win me, that being my vow'd foe Deserves so well? I thanke you for my life; But how I shall deserve it, give me leave Hereafter to consider. Exit. Alv. Quit thy feare, All danger is blown over: I have Letters To the Governour, in the Kings name, to secure us, From such attempts hereafter: yet we need not That have such strong guards of our own, dread others; And to encrease thy comfort, know, this young man Whom with such fervent earnestnesse you eye, Is not what he appeares, but such a one As thou with joy wilt blesse, thy daughter Clara. Eug. A thousand blessings in that word. Alv. The reason Why I have bred her up thus, at more leisure I will impart unto you: wonder not At what you have seen her doe, it being the least Of many great and valiant undertakings She hath made good with honour. Eug. Ile returne The joy I have in her, with one as great To you my Alvarez: you, in a man Have given to me a daughter: in a woman, I give to you a Sonne: this was the pledge You left here with me, whom I have brought up Different from what he was, as you did Clara, And with the like successe; as she appeares Alter'd by custome, more then woman, he Transform'd by his soft life, is lesse then man. Alv. Fortune, in this gives ample satisfaction For all our sorrowes past. Luc. My deerest Sister. Cla. Kinde brother. Alv. Now our mutuall care must be Imploy'd to help wrong'd nature, to recover Her right in either of them, lost by custome: To you I give my Clara, and receive My Lucio to my charge: and we'll contend With loving industry, who soonest can Turne this man woman or this woman, man.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus. Scæna prima. Enter Pachieco, and Lazarillo. Pac. Boy: my Cloake, and Rapier; it fits not a Gentleman of my ranck, to walke the streets in Querpo. Laz. Nay, you are a very ranck Gent. Signior, I am very hungry, they tell me in Civill here, I looke like an Eele, with a mans head: and your neighbour the Smith here hard by, would have borrowed me th'other day, to have fish'd with me, because he had lost his angle-rod. Pac. Oh happy thou Lazarillo (being the cause of other mens wits) as in thine own: live leane, and witty still: oppresse not thy stomach too much: grosse feeders, great sleepers: great sleepers, fat bodies; fat bodies, lean braines: No Lazarillo, I will make thee immortall, change thy humanitie into dietie, for I will teach thee to live upon nothing. Laz. Faith Signior, I am immortall then already, or very neere it, for I doe live upon little or nothing: belike that's the reason the Poets are said to be immortall, for some of them live upon their wits, which is indeed as good as little or nothing: But good Master, let me be mortall still, and let's goe to supper. Pac. Be abstinent; shew not the corruption of thy generation: he that feeds, shall die, therefore he that feeds not, shall live. Laz. I; but how long shall he live? ther's the question. Pac. As long as he can without feeding: did'st thou read of the miraculous maid in Flanders? Laz. No, nor of any maid else; for the miracle of virginitie now a daies ceases, ere the virgin can read virginitie? Pac. She that liv'd three yeere without any other sustenance then the smell of a Rose. Laz. I heard of her Signior; but they say her guts shrunck all into Lute-strings, and her neather-parts cling'd together like a Serpents Taile, so that though she continued a woman still above the girdle, beneath yet she was monster. Pac. So are most women, beleeve it. Laz. Nay all women Signior, that can live onely upon the smell of a Rose. Pac. No part of the History is fabulous. Laz. I thinke rather no part of the Fable is Historicall: but for all this, sir, my rebellious stomach will not let me be immortall: I will be as immortall, as mortall hunger will suffer: put me to a certaine stint sir, allow me but a red herring a day. Pac. O' de dios: would'st thou be gluttonous in thy delicacies? Laz. He that eats nothing but a red herring a day, shall neere be broyl'd for the devils rasher: a Pilcher, Signior, a Surdiny, an Olive, that I may be a philosopher first, and immortall after. Pac. Patience Lazarillo; let contemplation be thy food a while: I say unto thee, one Peaze was a Souldiers provant a whole day, at the destruction of Ierusalem. Enter Metaldi, &amp; Mendoza. Laz. I: and it were any where, but at the destruction of a place i'le be hang'd. Met. Signior Pachieco Alasto, my most ingenious Cobler of Civill, the bonos noxios to your Signiorie. Pac. Signior Metaldi de forgio, my most famous Smith, and man of mettle, I returne your curtesie ten fold, and do humble my Bonnet beneath the Shooe-soale of your congie: the like to you Signior Mendoza Pediculo de vermim, my most exquisite Hose-heeler. Laz. Her's a greeting betwixt a Cobler, a Smith, and a Botcher: they all belong to the foot, which makes them stand so much upon their Centrie. Mend. Signior Lazarilla. Laz. Ah Signior see: nay, we are all Signiors here in Spaine, from the Jakes-farmer to the Grandee, or Adelantado: this botcher looks as if he w're dowgh-bak'd a little butter now, and I could eate him like an oaten-Cake: His fathers dies was new Cheese and Onions when he got him: what a scallion fac'd-rascall 'tis? Met. But why Signior Pachieco, do you stand so much on the prioritie, and antiquitie of your qualitie (as you call it) in comparison of ours? Mend. I; your reason for that. Pac. Why thou Iron-pated Smith: and thou wollen-witted Hose heeler: heare what I will speak indifferently (and according to Ancient writers) of our three professions: and let the upright Lazarillo be both judge, and moderator. Laz. Still am I the most immortally hungrie, that may be. Pac. Suppose thou wilt derive thy pedigree, like some of the old Heroes, (as Hercules, Æeas, Achilles) lineally from the Gods, making Saturne thy great Grand-father, and Vulcan thy Father: Vulcan was a God. Laz. He'll make Vulcan your God-father by and by. Pac. Yet I say Saturne was a crabbed block-head, and Vulgan a limping horn-head, for Uenus his wife was a strumpet, and Mars begat all her Children; therefore however, thy originall must of necessitie spring from Bastardie: further, what can be a more deject spirit in man, then to lay his hands under every ones horses feet, to doe him service, as thou do'st? For thee, I will be briefe thou do'st botch, and not mend, thou art a hider of enormities, viz. scabs, chilblaines, and kibed heeles: much proane thou art to Sects, and Heresies, disturbing state, and goverment; for how canst thou be a sound member in the Common-wealth, that art so subject to stitches in the anckles? blush, and be silent then, Oh ye Machanick, compare no more with the politique Cobler: For Coblers (in old time) have prophesied, what may they doe now then, that have every day waxed better, and better? have we not the length of every mans foot? are we not daily menders? yea, and what menders? not horse-menders. Laz. Nor manners-menders. Pach. But soule-menders: Oh divine Coblers; doe we not like the wise man spin our own threds, (or our wives for us?) doe we not by our sowing the hide, reape the beefe? are not we of the gentle craft, whil'st both you are but crafts-men? You will say you feare neither Iron nor steele, and what you get is wrought out of the fire, I must answer you againe, though all this is but forgery, You may likewise say, a mans a man, that has but a hose on his head: I must likewise answer, that man is a botcher, that has a heel'd-hose on his head: to conclude there can be no comparison with the Cobler, who is all in all in the Common-wealth, has his politique eye and ends on every mans steps that walkes, and whose course shall be lasting to the worlds end. Net. I give place: the wit of man is wonderfull: thou hast hit the naile on the head, and I will give thee six pots for't though I neere clinth shooe againe. Enter Vitelli &amp; Alguazier. Pac. Who's this? Oh our Alguazier: as arrant a knave as E're wore ont head under two offices: he is one side Alguazier. Met. The other side Serjeant. Mend. That's both sides carrion I am sure. Pac. This is he apprehends whores in the way of justice, and lodges 'em in his own house, in the way of profit: he with him, is the Grand-Don Vitelli, 'twixt whom and Fernando Alvarez the mortall hatred is: he is indeed my Dons Bawd, and do's at this present lodge a famous Curtizan of his, lately come from Madrill. Vit. Let her want nothing Signior, she can aske: What losse, or injury you may sustaine I will repaire, and recompence your love: Onely that fellowes coming I mislike, And did fore-warn her of him: beare her this With my best love, at night i'le visit her. Alg. I rest your Lordships Servant. Vit. Good ev'n, Signiors: Oh Alvarez, thou hast brought a Sonne with thee Both brightnes, and obscures our Nation, Whose pure strong beames on us, shoot like the Suns On baser fires: I would to heaven my blood Had never stain'd thy bold unfortunate hand, That with mine honour I might emulate Not persecute such vertue: I will see him Though with the hazard of my life: no rest In my contentious spirits can I finde Till I have gratefide him in like kinde. Exit. Alg. I know you not: what are ye? hence ye base Besegnios. Pac. Mary Catzo Signior Alguazier, do'ye not know us? why, we are your honest neighbours, the Cobler, Smith, and Botcher, that have so often sate snoaring cheeke by joll with your signiorie in rug at midnight. Laz. Nay, good Signior, be not angry: you must understand, a Cat and such an Officer see best in the dark. Met. By this hand, I could finde in my heart to shooe his head. Pac. Why then know you Signior; thou mongrill begot at midnight, at the Goale gate, by a Beadle, on a Catch-poles wife, are not you he that was whipt out, of Toledo for perjury. Men. Next, condemn'd to the Gallies for pilfery, to the buls pizell. Met. And after call'd to the Inquisition, for Apostacie. Pac. Are not you he that rather then you durst goe an industrious voyage being press'd to the Islands, skulk'd till the fleet was gone, and then earn'd your royall a day by squiring puncks, and puncklings up and down the City? Laz. Are not you a Portuguize borne, descended o'the Moores, and came hither into Civill with your Master, an errant Taylor, in your red Bonnet, and your Blew Jacket lowrie: though now your block-head be cover'd with the Spanish Block, and your lashed Shoulders with a Velvet Pee? Pac. Are not you he, that have been of thirty callings, yet ne're a one lawfull? that being a Chandler first, profess'd sincerity, and would sell no man Mustard to his beefe on the Sabbath, and yet sold Hypocrisie all your life time? Met. Are not you he, that were since a Surgeon to the Stewes, and undertooke to cure what the Church it selfe could not, strumpets that rise to your Office by being a great Dons Baw'd? Laz. That commit men nightly, offenceless, for the gaine of a groat a Prisoner, which your Beadle seemes to put up, when you share three pence? Mend. Are not you he, that is a kisser of men, in drunkennesse, and a berrayer in sobriety? Alg. Diabolo: they'll raile me into the Gallyes again. Pac. Yes Signior, thou art even he we speake of all this while: thou maist by thy place now, lay us by the heeles: 'tis true: but take heed, be wiser, pluck not ruine on thine own head: for never was there such an Anatomy, as we shall make thee then: be wise therefore, Oh thou Childe of the night! be friends and shake hands, thou art a proper man, if thy beard were redder: remember thy worshipfull function, a Constable though thou turn'st day into night, and night into day, what of that? watch lesse, and pray more: gird thy beares skin (viz. thy Rug-gowne) to thy loyes, take thy staffe in thy hand, and goe forth at midnight: Let not thy mittens abate the talons of thy authority, but gripe theft and whoredom, wheresoever thou meet'st 'em: bear'em away like a tempest, and lodge 'em safely in thine own house: Laz. Would you have whores and theeves lodg'd in such a house? Pac. They ever doe so: I have found a theefe, or a whore there, when the whole Suburbs could not furnish me. Laz. But why doe they lodge there? Pac. That they may be safe, and forth-coming: for in the morning usually the theefe is sent to the Goale, and the whore prostrates her selfe to the Justice. Mend. Admirable Pachieco. Met. Thou Cobler of Christendom. Alg. There is no railing with these rogues: I will close with'em, till I can cry quittance: why Signiors, and my honest neighbours, will you impute that as a neglect of my friends, which is an imperfection in me? I have been Sand-blinde from my infancie: to make you amends, you shall sup with me. Laz. Shall we sup with'ye sir? O' my conscience, they have wrong'd the Gentleman extreamly, Alg. And after supper, I have a project to employ you in shall make you drink, &amp; eat merrily this moneth: I am a little knavish: why and doe not I know all you to be knaves? Pac. I grant you, we are all knaves, and will be your knaves: But, oh, while you live, take heed of being a proud knave. Alg. On then passe: I will beare out my staffe, and my staffe shall beare out me. Laz. Oh Lazarillo, thou art going to supper. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Lucio, and Bobadilla. Luc. Pray be not angry. I am angry, and I will be angry diablo': what should you doe in the Kitchin, cannot the Cooks lick their fingers without your overseeing? nor the maids make pottage, except your dogs-head be in the pot? Don Lucio, Don Quot-queane, Don Spinster, weare a Petti-coate still, and put on your smock a' monday: I will have a badie o' clouts made for it, like a great girl: nay, if you will needs be starching of Ruffs, and sowing of black-work, I will of a milde, and loving Tutor, become a Tyrant, Your Father has committed you to my charge, and I will make a man, or a mouse on you. Luc. What would you have me doe? this scurvy sword So gals my thigh: I would 'twer burnt: pish, looke This cloak will ne'r keep on: these boots too hide bound, Make me walk stiffe, as if my leggs were frozen, And my Spurs gingle, like a Morris-dancer: Lord, how my head akes, with this roguish hat; This masculine attire, is most uneasie, I am bound up in it: I had rather walke In folio, againe, loose, like a woman. Bob. In Foolio, had you not? Thou mock to heav'n, and nature, and thy Parents, Thou tender Legge of Lamb; Oh, how he walkes As it he had be-piss'd himselfe, and fleares! Is this a gate for the young Cavalier, Don Lucio, Sonne and heire to Alvarez? Has it a corne? or do's it walke on conscience, It treads so gingerly? Come on your wayes, Suppose me now your Fathers foe, Vitelli, And spying you i'th' street, thus I advance, I twist my Beard, and then I draw my sword. Luc. Alas. Bob. And thus accost thee: traiterous brat, How dur'st thou thus confront me? impious twig Of that old stock, dew'd with my kinsmans gore, Draw, for i'le quarter thee in peeces foure. Luc. Nay, Prethee Bobadilla, leave thy fooling, Put up thy sword, I will not meddle with ye; I, justle me, I care not: I'le not draw, Pray be a quiet man. Bob. Do'ye heare: answer me, as you would doe Don Vitelli, or i'le be so bold as to lay the pomell of my sword over the bilts of your head my name's Vitelli, and i'le have the wall. Luc. Why then i'le have the kennell: what a coyle you keepe? Signior, what happen'd 'twixt my Sire and your Kinsman, was long before I saw the world, No fault of mine, nor will I justifie My Fathers crimes: forget sir, and forgive, 'Tis Christianity: I pray put up your sword, Ile give you any satisfaction That may become a Gentleman; however I hope you are bred to more humanity Then to revenge my Fathers wrong on me That crave your love, and peace: law you now Zancho Would not this quiet him, were he ten Vitallies. Bob. Oh craven-chicken of a Cock o'th'game: well, what remedy? did thy father see this, O' my conscience, he would cut of thy Masculine gender, crop thine eares, beat out thine eyes, and set thee in one of the Peare-trees for a scar-crow: As I am Vitelli, I am satisfied, but as I am Bobadilla Spindola Zancho, Steward of the house, and thy fathers servant, I could finde in my heart to lop of the hinder part of thy face, or to beat all thy teeth into thy mouth: Oh thou whay-blooded milk-sop, Ile waite upon thee no longer, thou shalt ev'n waite upon me: come your wayes fir, I shall take a little paines with ye else. Enter Clara. Cla. Where art thou Brother Lucio? ran tan tan ta ran tan ran tan tan, ta ran tan tan tan. Oh, I shall no more see those golden dayes, these clothes will never fadge with me: a—O' this filthie vardingale, this hip hape: brother why are womens hanches onely limited, confin'd, hoop'd in, as it were with these same scurvy vardingales? Bob. Because womens hanches onely are most subject to display and fly out. Cla. Bobadilla, rogue, ten Duckets, I hit the propose of thy Cod-peice. Luc. Hold, if you love my life, Sister: I am not Zancho Bobadilla, I am your brother Lucio: what a fright you have put me in? Cla. Brother? and wherefore thus? Luc. Why, Master Steward here, Signior Zancho, made me change: he do's nothing but misuse me, and call me Cowheard, and sweares I shall waite upon him. Bob. Well: I doe no more then, I have authority for: would I were away though: for she's as much too mannish, as he too womanish: I dare not meddle with her, yet I must set a good face on't (if I had it) I have like charge of you Maddam, I am as well to mollifie you, as to qualifie him: what have you to doe with Armors, and Pistols, and Javelins, and swords, and such tooles? remember Mistresse; nature hath given you a sheath onely, to signifie women are to put up mens weapons, not to draw them: looke you now, in this a fit trot for a Gentlewoman? You shalt see the Court Ladies move like Goddesses, as if they trod ayre; they will swim you their measures, like whiting-mops as if their feet were sinnes, and the hinges of their knees oyld: doe they love to ride great horses, as you doe? no, they love to ride great asses sooner: faith, I know not what to say to'ye both: Custome hath turn'd nature topsie-turvy in you. Cla. Nay but Master Steward. Bob. You cannot trot so fast, but he ambles as slowly. Cla. Signior Spindle, will you heare me, Bob. He that shall come to bestride your virginitie, had better be afoot o're the Dragon. Cla. Very well. Bob. Did ever Spanish Lady pace so? Cla. Hold these a little. Luc. Ile not touch 'em, I. Cla. First doe I breake your Office o're your pate, You Dog-skin-fac'd-rogue, pilcher, you poore Iohn, Which I will be at to Stock-fish. Luc. Sister. Bob. Maddam. Cla. You Cittern-head, who have you talk'd to, hah? You nasty, stincking, and ill-countenanc'd Cur. Bob. By this hand, Ile bang your brother for this, when I get him alone. Cla. How? kick him Lucio, he shall kick you Bob, Spight o' the nose, that's flat: kick him, I say, Or I will cut thy head off. Bob. Softly y'had best. Cla. Now, thou leane, dride, and ominous visag'd knave, Thou false and peremptory Steward, pray, For I will hang thee up in thine own Chaine. Luc. Good Sister, doe not choake him. Bob. Murder, murder. Exit. Cla. Well: I shall meet with 'ye: Lucio, who bought this? 'Tis a reasonable good one; but there hangs one Spaines Champion ne're us'd truer: with this Staffe Old Alvarez has led up men so close, They could almost spit in the Canons mouth, Whil'st I with that, and this well mounted, scurr'd A Horse-troope through, and through, like swift desire; And seen poor rogues retire, all gore, and gash'd Like bleeding Shade. Luc. 'Blesse us, Sister Clara, How desperately you talke: what do'ye call This Gun a dag? Cla. Ile give't thee: a French petronell: You never saw my Barbary, the Infanta Bestow'd upon me, as yet Lucio? Walke down, and see it. Luc. What into the Stable? Not I, the Jades wil kick: the poore Groom there Was almost spoyld the other day. Cla. Fie on thee, Thou wilt scarce be a man before thy mother. Luc. When wil you be a woman? Enter Alvarez and Bobadilla. Cla. Would I were none. But natures privy Seale assures me one. Alv. Thou angerst me: can strong habituall custome Work with such Magick on the mind, and manners In spight of sex and nature? finde out sirha, Some skilfull fighter. Bob. Yes sir. Alv. I wil rectifie, And redeem eithers proper inclination, Or bray 'em in a morter, and new mold 'em. (Exit. Bob. Believe your eyes sir; I tell you, we wash an Ethiop. Cla. I strike it for ten Duckets. Alv. How now Clara, Your breeches on still? and your petticote Not yet off Lucio? art thou not guelt? Or did the cold Muscovite beget thee, That lay here Lieger in the last great frost? Art not thou Clara, turn'd a man indeed Beneath the girdle? and a woman thou? Ile have you search'd by—,I strongly doubt; We must have these things mended: come go in. Exit. Enter Vitelli, and Bobadilla. Bob. With Lucio say you? there is for you. Vit. And there is for thee. Bob. I thank you: you have now bought a little advice Of me; if you chance to have conference with that Lady there, be very civill, or looke to your head: she has Ten nailes, and you have but two eyes: If any foolish Hot motions should chance to rise in the horizon Under your equinoctiall there, qualifie it as well as You can, for I feare the elevation of your pole will Not agree with the Horoscope of her constitution: She is Bell the Dragon I assure you. Exit. Vit. Are you the Lucio, sir, that sav'd Vitelli? Luc. Not I indeed sir, I did never brable; There walks that Lucio, metamorphosed. Exit. Vit. Do ye mock me? Cla. No, he do's not: I am that Suposed Lucio, that was but Clara, That is, and daughter unto Alvarez. Vit. Amazement daunts me; would my life were riddles, So you were still my faire Expositor: Protected by a Lady from my death. Oh I shall weare an everlasting blush Upon my cheek from this discovery: Oh you the fairest Souldier, I ere saw; Each of whose eyes, like a bright beamy shield Conquers, without blowes, the contentious. Cla. Sir, guard your self, you are in your enemies house, And may be iniur'd. Vit. Tis impossible: Foe, nor oppressing odds dares prove Vitelli, If Clara side him, and wil call him friend; I would the difference of our bloods were such As might with any shift be wip'd away: Or would to Heaven your selfe were all your name; That having lost blood by you, I might hope To raise blood from you. But my black-wing'd face Hovers aversely over that fond hope: And he, whose tongue thus gratifies the daughter, And sister of his enemy, weares a Sword To rip the father and the brother up. Thus you, that sav'd this wretched life of mine, Have savd it to the ruine of your friends. That my affections should promiscuously Dart love and hate at once, both worthily? Pray let me kisse your hand. Cla. You are treacherous, And come to do me mischiefe. Vit. Speake on still: Your words are falser (faire) then my intents, And each sweet ancient far more treacherous; for Though you speak ill of me, you speak so well, I doe desire to heare you. Cla. Pray be gone: Or kill me, if you please. Uit. Oh, neither can: For to be gone, were to destroy my life; And to kill you, were to destroy my soule: I am in love, yet must not be in love: Ile get away a pace: yet valiant Lady, Such gratitude to honour I do owe, And such obedience to your memory, That if you will bestow something, that I May weare about me, it shall bind all wrath, My most inveterate wrath, from all attempts, Till you and I meet next. Cla. A favour sir? Why I wil 'give ye good councell. Vit. That already You have bestowd. a Ribbon, or a Glove. Cla. Nay those are tokens for a waiting maid To trim the Butler with. Vit. Your feather. Cla. Fie; the wenches give them to their Serving-men. Vit. That little ring. Cla. Twill hold you but by th'finger; And I would have you faster. Vit. Any thing That I may weare, and but remember you. Cla. This smile: my good opinion, or my self. But that it seems you like not. Uit. Yes, so well: When any smiles, I will remember yours; Your good opinion shall in weight poize me Against a thousand ill: Lastly, your selfe, My curious eye now figures in my heart, Where I wil weare you, till the Table breake. So, whitest Angels guard you. Cla. Stay sir, I Have fitly thought to give, what you as fitly May not disdaine to weare. Vit. What's that? Cla. This Sword. I never heard a man speak till this houre. His words are golden chaines, and now I feare The Lyonesse hath met a tamer here; Fie, how his tongue chimes: what was I saying? Oh: this favour I bequeath you, which I tie In a love-knot, fast, nere to hurt my friends; Yet be it fortunate 'gainst all your foes (For I have neither friend, nor foe, but yours) As ere it was to me: I have kepit it long, And value it, next my Virginity: But good, return it, for I now remember I vow'd, who purchas'd it, should have me too. Vit. would that were possible: but alas it is not; Yet this assure your selfe, most honour'd Clara, Ile not infringe an Article of breath My vow hath offerd to ye: nor from this part Whilst it hath edge, or point, or I a heart. Exit. Cla. Oh leave me living: what new exercise Is crept into my breast, that blauncheth clean My former nature? I begin to finde I am a woman, and must learn to fight A softer sweeter battaile, then with Swords. I am sick me thinks, but the disease I feele Pleaseth, and punisheth: I warrant love Is very like this, that folks talke of so; I skill not what it is, yet sure even here, Even in my heart, I sensibly perceive It glows, and riseth like a glimmering flame, But know not yet the essence on't nor name.

Alg. Lady. Mal. Peace, peace, you rotten rogue, supported by A staffe of rottener office: dare you check Anys accesses, that I wil allow? Piorato is my friend, and visits me In lawfull sort to espouse me as his wife; And who wil crosse, or shall our enter-viewes? You know me sirha, for no Chambermaid, That cast her belly, and her wastcote lately; Thou thinkst thy Constableship is much: not so, I am ten offices to thee: I, thy house, Thy house, and Office is maintain'd by me. Alg. My house of office is maintain'd ith' garden: Go too, I know you, and I have contriv'd; Y'are a delinquent, but I have contriv'd A poyson, though not in the third degree: I can say, blacks your eye, though it be grey; I have connivd at this your friend, and you: But what is got by this connivency? I like his feather well: a proper man, Of good discourse, fine conversation, Valiant, and a great carrier of the businesse, Sweet breasted, as the Nightingale, or Thrush: Yet I must tell you; you forget your selfe, My Lord Vitellies love, and maintenance Deserves no other Jack ith'box, but he: What though he gather'd first the golden fruit, And blew your pigges-coat up into a blister, When you did wait at Court upon his mother; Has he not wel provided for the barne? Beside, what profit reap I by the other? If you wil have me serve your pleasure, Lady, Your pleasure must accommodate my service; As good be vertuous and poore, as not Thrive by my knavery: all the world would be Good, prosper'd goodnesse like to villany. I am the Kings vice-gerent by my place; His right Lieutenant in mine owe precinct. Mal. Thou art a right rascall in all mens precincts; Yet now my paire of twins, of foole, and knave, Looke we are friends; there's Gold for thee, admit Whom I wil have, and keep it from my Don; And I will make thee richer then thou art wise: Thou shalt be my Bawd, and my Officer: Thy children shall eate still my good night Owle, And thy old wife sell Andyrons to the Court, Be countenanced by the Dons, and weare a hood, Nay keepe my garden-house, Ile call her mother, Thee father, my good poysonous red-har'd Dill, And Gold shall daily be thy Sacrifice, Wrought from a fertill Island of mine owne, Which I wil offer, like an Indian Queen. Alg. And I wil be thy divel, thou my flesh, With which Ile catch the world. Mal. Fill some Tobacco, And bring it in: if Piorato come Before my Don, admit him; if my Don Before my Love, conduct him, my deere devill. Exit. Alg. I wil my dear flesh: first come, first serv'd. Wel said. O equall Heaven, how wisely thou disposest Thy severall gifts? one's born a great rich foole, For the subordinate knave to worke upon: Anothers poore, with wits addition, Which wel or ill us'd, builds a living up; And that too from the Sire oft discends: Onely faire vertue, by traduction Never succeeds, and seldome meets successe; What have I then to do with 't? My free will Left me by Heaven, makes me or good, or ill: Now since vice gets more in this vicious world Then piety, and my stars confluence Enforce my disposition to affect Gaine, and the name of rich, let who wil practice War, and grow that way great: religious, And that way good: my chiefe felicity Is wealth the nurse of sensuality: And he that mainly labours to be rich, Must scratch great scabs, and claw a Strumpets itch. Exit. Scæna secunda. Enter Piorato, and Bobadilla, with Letters. Pio. To say sir, I wil wait upon your Lord, Were not to understand my selfe. Bob. To say sir You wil doe any thing but wait upon him, Were not to understand my Lord. Pio. Ile meet him Some halfe houre hence, and doubt not but to render His sonne a man againe: the cure is easie, I have done divers. Bob. Women do ye mean, sir? Pio. Cures I do mean sir: be there but one sparke Of fire remaining in him unextinct, With my discourse Ile blow it to a flame; And with my practice, into action: I have had one so full of childish feare, And womanish hearted sent to my advice, He durst not draw a Knife to cut his meat. Bob. And how sir, did you help him? Pio. Sir, I kept him Seaven daies in a darke room by Candle-light, A plenteous Table spread with all good meats, Before his eyes, a case of keen broad Knives, Upon the board, and he so watchd, he might not Touch the least modicum, unlesse he cut it: And thus I brought him first to draw a knife. Bob. Good. Pio. Then for ten daies did I diet him Onely with burnt Porke sir, and gammons of Bacon; A pill of Caveary now and then, Which breeds choler adust you know. Bob. Tis true. Pio. And to purge phlegmatick humor, and cold crudities; In all that time, he dranke me Aqua fortis, And nothing else but— Bob. Aqua vite Signior, For Aqua fortis poysons. Pio. Aqua fortis I say again: what's one mans poyson Signior, Is anothers meat or drinke. Bob. Your patience sir; By your good patience, h'ad a huge cold stomacke. Pio. I fir'd it: and gave him then three sweats In the Artillery-yard three drilling daies: And now he'l shoot a Gun, and draw a Sword, And fight with any man in Christendome. Bob. A receipt for a coward: Ile be bold sir To write your good prescription. Pio. Sir, hereafter You shall, and underneath it put probatum: Is your chaine right? Bob. Tis both right and just sir; For though I am a Steward, I did get it With no mans wrong. Pio. You are witty. Bob. So, so. Could you not cure one sir, of being too rash And over-daring? there now's my disease: Fool-hardy as they say, for that in sooth I am. Pio. Most easily. Bob. How? Pio. To make you drunke sir, With smal Beere once a day; and beat you twice, Till you be bruis'd all over: if that help not, Knock out your braines. Bob. This is strong Physick Signior, And never wil agree with my weak body: I finde the medcine worse then the malady, And therefore wil remain fool-hardy stil: You'l come sir? Pio: As I am a Gentleman. Bob. A man oth'Sword should never break his word. Pio. Ile overtake you: I have onely sir A complementall visitation To offer to a Mistris lodgd here by. Bob. A Gentlewoman? Pio. Yes sir. Bob. Faire, and comely? Pio. Oh sir, the Paragon, the Non-parill Of Civill, the most wealthy Mine of Spaine, For beauty, and perfection. Bob. Say you so? Might not a man entreat a curtesie, To walke along with you Signior, to peruse This dainty Mine, though not to dig in't Sgnior? Hauh—I hope you'l not deny me, being a stranger; Though I am Steward, I am flesh and blood, And fraile as other men. Pio. Sir, blow your nose: I dare not for the world: no, she is kept By a great, Don, Vitelli, Bob. How? Pio. Tis true. Bob. See, things wil veere about: this Don Vitelli Am I to seeke now, to deliver Letters From my young Mistris Clara; and I tell you, Under the Rose, because you are a stranger, And my speciall friend, I doubt there is A little foolish love betwixt the parties Unknown unto my Lord. Pio. Happy discovery: My fruit begins to ripen: hark you sir, I would not wish you now, to give those Letters: But home, and ope this to Madona Clara, Which when I come Ile justifie, and relate More amply, and particularly. Bob. I approve Your counsell, and wil practice it: bazilos manos: Here's two chewres chewrd; when wisdome is imployd Tis ever thus: your more acquaintance, Signior: I say not better, least you think, I thought not Yours good enough. Exit. Enter Alguazier. Pio. Your servant excellent Steward. Would all the Dons in Spain had no more brains, Here comes the Alguazier: dieu vous guard Mounsier. Is my cuz stirring yet? Alg. Your cuz (good cosen?) A whore is like a foole, akin to all The gallants in the Town: Your coz, good Signior, Is gone abroad sir with her other cosen, My Lord Vitelli: since when there hath been Some dozen cosens here to enquire for her. Pia. She's greatly alli'd sir. Alg. Marry is she sir, Come of a lusty kindred: the truth is, I must connive no more: no more admittance Must I consent to; my good Lord has threatned me, And you must pardon. Pio. Out upon thee man, Turne honest in thine age? one foot ith' grave? Thou shalt not wrong thy selfe so, for a million: Looke, thou three-headed Cerberus (for wit I mean) here is one sop, and two, and three, For every chop a bit. Alg. I marry sir: Wel, the poore heart loves you but too wel. We have been talking on you 'faith this houre: Where, what I said, goe too: she loves your valour: Oh and your Musicke most abominably: She is within sir, and alone: what meane you? Pio. That is your Sergeants fide, I take it sir; Now I endure your Constables much better; There is lesse danger in't: for one you know Is a tame harmlesse monster in the light, The Sergeant salvage both by day, and night. Alg. Ile call her to you for that. Pio. No, I wil charme her. Enter Malroda. Alg. She's come. Pio. My Spirit. Mal. Oh my Sweet, Leape hearts to lips, and in our kisses meet. Pio. Turn, turn thy beauteous face away, Song. How pale and sickly mak't the day, In emulation of thy brighter beams! Oh envious light, fly, fly, be gone, Come night, and peece two breasts as one; When what love does, we will repeat in dreams. Yet (thy eyes open) who can day hence fright, Let but their lids fall, and it will be night. Alg. Wel, I wil leave you to your fortitude; And you to temperance: ah, ye pretty paire, Twere sin to sunder you. Lovers being alone Make one of two, and day and night all one. But fall not out, I charge you, keep the peace; You know my place else. Exit. Mal. No, you wil not marry: You are a Courtier, and can sing (my Love) And want no Mistrisses: but yet I care not, Ile love you still; and when I am dead for you, Then you'l believe my truth. Pio. You kill me (faire) It is my lesson that you speake: have I In any circumstance deserv'd this doubt? I am not like your false and perjur'd Don That here maintains you, and has vowd his faith, And yet attempts in way of marriage A Lady not far off. Mal. How's that? Pio. Tis so: And therefore Mistris, now the time is come You may demand his promise; and I sweare To marry you with speed. Mal. And with that Gold Which Don Vitelli gives, you'l walke some voyage And leave me to my trade; and laugh, and brag, How you ore-reach'd a whore, and guld a Lord. Pio. You anger me extreamly: fare you wel. What should I say to be believd? expose me To any hazzard; or like jealous Juno (Th'incensed step-mother of Hercules) Designe me labours most impossible, Ile doe 'em, or die in 'em; so at last You wil believe me. Mal. Come, we are friends: I doe. I am thine, walk in: my Lord has sent me outsides, But thou shalt have 'em, the colours are too sad: Pio. 'Faith Mistris, I want clothes indeed. Mal. I have Some Gold too, for my servant. Pio. And I have A better mettle for my Mistris. Exeunt. Scena tertia. Enter Vitelli and Alguazier, at severall doors. Alg. Undone—wit now or never help me: my Master He wil cut my throat, I am a dead Constable; And he'l not be hangd neither, there's the griefe: The party sir is here. Vit. What? Alg. He was here; I cry your Lordship mercy: but I rattled him; I told him here was no companions For such deboshd, and poor-condition'd fellows; I bid him venture not so desperately The cropping of his eares, slitting his nose, Or being gelt. Uit. I was wel done. Alg. Please your honour, I told him there were Stewes, and then at last Swore three or foure great oathes she was remov'd, Which I did thinke I might in conscience, Being for your Lordship. Vit. What became of him? Alg. Faith sir, he went away with a fiealin's eare, Like a poore cur, clapping his trindle taile Betwixt his legs.—A chi ba, a chi ba, a chi ba—now luck. Enter Malroda and Piorato. Mal. Tis he, do as I told thee: 'Blesse thee Signior. Oh, my deare Lord. Vit. Malroda, what alone? Mal. She never is alone, that is accompanied With noble thoughts, my Lords and mine are such, Being onely of your Lordship. Vit. Pretty Lasse. Mal. Oh my good Lord, my picture's done: but 'faith It is not like; nay this way sir, the light Strikes best upon it here. Pio. Excellent wench. Exit. Alg. I am glad the danger's over. Exit. Vit. Tis wondrous like, But that Art cannot counterfeit what Nature Could make but once. Mal. All's cleare; another tune You must heare from me now: Vitelli, thou'rt A most perfidious and a perjur'd man, As ever did usurpe Nobility. Vit. What meanst thou Mal.? Mal. Leave your betraying smiles, And change the tunes of your inticing tongues To penitentiall prayers; for I am great In labour even with anger, big with child Of womans rage, bigger then when my wombe Was pregnant by thee: goe seducer, fly Out of the world, let me the last wretch be Dishonoured by thee: touch me not, I loath My very heart, because thou layst there long; A woman's wel helpt up, that's confident In ere a glittering outside on you all: Would I had honestly been matchd to some Poore Countrey-swaine, ere known the vanity Of Court: peace then had been my portion, Nor had been cozend by an houres pompe To be a whore unto my dying day. Vit. Oh the uncomfortable waies such women have, Their different speech and meaning, no assurance In what they say or do: Dissemblers Even in their prayers, as if the weeping Greeke That flatter'd Troy afire had been their Adam; Lyers, as if their mother had been made Onely of all the falshood of the man, Dispos'd into that rib: Do I know this, And more: nay, all that can concern this Sex, With the true end of my creation? Can I with rationall discourse sometimes Advance my spirit into Heaven, before 'T has shook hands with my body, and yet blindly Suffer my filthy flesh to master it, With sight of such faire fraile beguiling objects? When I am absent, easily I resolve Nere more to entertaine those strong desires That triumph ore me, even to actuall sin; Yet when I meet again those sorserers eyes, Their beames my hardest resolutions thaw, As if that cakes of Ice and July met, And her sighes powerfull as the violent North, Like a light feather twirle me round about And leave me in mine own low state again. What aylst thou? prethee weep not: Oh, those tears If they were true, and righly spent, would raise A flowry spring ith' midst of January: Celestiall Ministers with Christall cups Would stoop to save 'em for immortall drink: But from this passion; why all this? Mal. Do ye ask? You are marrying: having made me unfit For any man, you leave me fit for all: Porters must be my burthens now, to live And fitting me your selfe for Carts, and Beadles You leave me to 'em: And who of all the world But the virago, your great Arch-foes daughter? But on: I care not, this poore rush: 'twill breed An excellent comedy: ha, ha: 't'makes me laugh: I cannot choose: the best is, some report It is a match for feare, not love o' your side. Vit. Why how the devill knows she, that I saw This Lady? are all whores peec'd with some witch? I will be merry, 'faith 'tis true, sweet heart, I am to marry? Mal. Are you? you base Lord. By—i'le Pistoll thee. Uit. A roaring whore? Take heed, there's a correction house hard by: You ha' learn'd this o' your swordman, that I warn'd you of, Your fencers, and your drunkards: but whereas You upbraid me with oathes, why I must tell you I ne're promis'd you marriage, nor have vow'd, But said I lov'd you, long as you remain'd The woman I expected, or you swore, And how you have fail'd of that (sweet heart) you know. You faine would shew your power, but fare you well, Ile keepe no more faith with an infidell. Mal. Nor I my bosome for a Turk: do'ye heare? Goe, and the devill take me, if ever I see you more: I was too true. Vit. Come, pish: That devill take the falsest of us two. Mal. Amen. Vit. You are an ill Clerk; and curse your selfe: Madnesse transports you: I confesse, I drew you Unto my will: but you must know that must not Make me doat on the habit of my sin. I will, to settle you to your content, Be master of my word: and yet he li'd That told you I was marrying, but in thought: But will you slave me to your tyranny So cruelly I shall not dare to looke Or speake to other women? make me not Your smocks Monopolie: come, let's be friends: Looke, her's a Jewell for thee: I will come At night, and— Mal. What 'yfaith: you shall not sir. Uit. 'Faith, and troth, and verily, but I will Ma. Halfe drunck, to make a noise, and raile? Uit. No, no, Sober, and dicted for the nonce: I am thine, I have won the day. Mal. The night (though) shall be mine. Exeunt. Scæna quarta. Enter Clara and Bobadilla with Letters. Cla. What said he sirha? Bob. Little, or nothing: faith I saw him not, Nor will not: he doth love a strumpet, Mistresse, Nay, keeps her spitefully, under the Constables nose, It shall be justifi'd by the Gentleman Your brothers Master, that is now within As practicing: there are your Letters: come You shall not cast your selfe away, while I live, Nor will I venture my right worshipfull place Enter Eugenia &amp; Sayavedra.

Ile in, to see Don Lucio mannage: he'll make A pretty peece of flesh; I promise you, He do's already handle his weapon finely. Exit. Eug. She knows your love sir, and the full allowance Her Father and my selfe approve it with, And I must tell you, I much hope it hath Wrought some impression, by her alteration; She sighes, and saies forsooth, and cries heigh ho, She'll take ill words oth' Steward, and the Servants, Yet answer affably, and modestly: Things sir, not usuall with her: there she is, Change some few words. Say. Maddam, I am bound to 'ye; How now, faire Mistresse, working? Cla. Yes forsooth, Learning to live another day. Say. That needs not. Cla. No forsooth: by my truly but it do's, We know not what we may come too. Eug. 'Tis strange. Say. Come, I ha beg'd leave for you to play. Cla. Forsooth 'Tis ill for a faire Lady to be idle. Say. She had better be well-busied, I know that. Turtle: me thinkes you mourne, shall I fit by you? Cla. If you be weary sir, you had best be gone (I work not a true stitch) now you'r my mate. Say. If I be so, I must doe more then fide you. Cla. Ev'n what you will, but tread me. Say. Shall we bill? Cla. Oh no, forsooth. Say. Being so faire, my Clara, Why do'ye delight in black-worke? Cla. Oh white sir, The fairest: Ladies like the blackest men: I ever lov'd the colour: all black things Are least subject to change. Say. Why, I doe love A black thing too: and the most beauteous faces Have oftnest of them: as the blackest eyes, Jet-arched browes, such haire: i'le kisse your hand. Cla. 'T will hinder me work my sir: and my Mother Will chide me, if I doe not doe my taske. Say. Your Mother, nor your Father shall chide: you Might have a prettier taske, would you be rul'd, And looke with open eyes. Cla. I stare upon you: And broadly see you: a wondrous proper man, Yet 'twere a greater taske for me to love you Then I shall ever work sir, in seven yeer, —o' this stitching, I had rather feele Two, then sow one:—this rogue h'as giv'n me a stitch Cleane crosse my heart: good faith sir: I shall prick you.

Is no more respect Due to this rod of justice? Mal. Doe you dispute? Good Doctor of the Dungeon, not a word more, —If you doe, my Lord Vitelli knowes it. Alg. Why I am bigge enough to answer him, Or any man. Mal. 'Tis well. Uitelli within. Vit. Malroda. Alg. How? Mal. You know the voice, and now crowch like a Cur Tane worrying sheepe: I now could have you guelded For a Bawd rampani: but on this submission For once I spare you Alg. I Will be reveng'd My honourable Lord. Vit. There's for thy care Alg. I am mad, starck mad: proud Pagan scorn her host I would I were but valiant enough to kick her, Enter Piorato &amp; Clara, above. Il'd wish no manhood else. Mal. What's that? Alg. I am gone. Exit. Pio. You see, I have kept my word. Cla. But in this object Hardly deserv'd my thanks. Pio. Is there ought else You will command me? Cla. Onely your sword Which I must have: nay willingly I yet know To force it, and to use it. Pio. 'Tis yours Lady. Cla. I ask no other guard. Pio. If so I leave you: And now, if that the Constable keepe his word, A poorer man may chance to gull a Lord. Exit. Mal. By this good—you shall not. Uit. By this— I must, and will, Malroda; What doe you make A stranger of me? Mal. I'le be so to you, And you shall find it. Vit. These are your old arts T'endeere the game you know I come to hunt for, Which I have borne too coldly. Mal. Doe so still, For if I heat you, hang me. Vit. If you doe not I know who'll starve for't: why, thou shame of women, Whose folly, or whose impudence is greater Is doubtfull to determine; this to me That know thee for a whore. Mal. And made me one, Remember that. Vit. Why should I but grow wise And tye that bounty up, which nor discretion Nor honour can give way too; thou wouldst be A Bawd e're twenty, and within a moneth A barefoot, lowzie, and diseased whore, And shift thy lodgings oftner then a rogue That's whipt from post to post. Mal. Pish: all our Colledge Know you can raile well in this kinde. Cla. For me He never spake so well. Vit. I have maintain'd thee The envy of great fortunes, made thee shine As if thy name were glorious: stuck thee full Of jewels, as the firmament of Starrs, And in it made thee so remarkable That it grew questionable, whether vertue poore, Or vice so set forth as it is in thee, Were even by modesties selfe to be prefer'd, And am I thus repaid? You are still my debtor; Can this (though true) be weigh'd with my lost honour, Much lesse my faith? I have liv'd private to you, And but for you, had ne're known what lust was, Nor what the sorrow for't. Vit. 'Tis false. Mal. 'Tis true, But how return'd by you, thy whole life being But one continued act of lust, and Shipwrack Of womens chastities. Vit. But that I know That she that dares be damn'd dares any thing, I should admire thy tempting me: but presume not On the power you thinke you hold o're my affections, It will deceive you: yeeld, and presently Or by the inflamed blood, which thou must quench Ile make a forcible entrie. Mal. Touch me not: You know I have a throat,—if you doe I will cry out a rape, or sheath this here, Ere i'le be kept, and us'd for Julip-water T'allay the heate which lushious meats and wine And not desire hath rais'd. Uit. A desperate devill, My blood commands my reason: I must take Some milder way. Mal. I hope (deere Don) I fit you. The night is mine, although the day was yours You are not fasting now: this speeding trick Which I would as a principle leave to all, That make their maintenance out of their own Indies As I doe now; my good old mother taught me, Daughter, quoth she, contest not with your lover His stomach being empty; let wine heat him, And then you may command him: 'tis a sure one: His lookes shew he is coming. Uit. Come this needs not, Especially to me: you know how deere I ever have esteemed you. Cla. Lost again. Uit. That any sight of yours, hath power to change My strongest resolution, and one teare Sufficient to command a pardon from me, For any wrong from you, which all mankinde Should kneel in vaine for. Mal. Pray you pardon those That need your favour, or desire it Vit. Prethee. Be better temper'd: Ile pay as a forfeit For my rash anger, this purse fil'd with Gold. Thou shalt have servants, gownes, attires, what not? Only continue mine. Mal. 'Twas this I fish'd for Vit. Look on me, and receive it. Mal. Well, you know My gentle nature, and take pride t'abuse it: You see a trifle pleases me, we are friends; This kisse, and this confirmes it. Cla. With my ruine. Mal. I'le have this dyamond, and this pearle. Uit. They are yours. Mal. But wil you not, when you have what you came for, Take them from me to morrow? tis a fashion Your Lords of late have us'd. Uit. But Ile not follow. Cla. That any man at such a rate as this Should pay for his repentance. Vit. Shall we to bed now? Mal. Instantly, Sweet: yet now I think on't better Ther's something first that in a word or two I must acquaint you with. Cla. Can I cry ayme, To this against my selfe? Ile break this match, Or make it stronger with my bloud. Descends. Enter Alguazier, Piorato, Pachieco, Metaldi, Mendoza, Lazarillo, &amp;c. Alg. I am yours, A Don's not priviledgd here more then yourself, Win her, and weare her. Pio. Have you a Priest ready? Alg. I have him for thee, Lad; and when I have Married this scornefull whore to this poor gallant. She wil make suit to me; there is a trick To bring a high-priz'd wench upon her knees: For you my fine neat Harpyes stretch your tallons And prove your selves true night-Birds. Pach. Take my word For me and all the rest. Laz. If there be meat Or any banquet stirring, you shall see How ile bestow my selfe. Alg. When they are drawn, Rush in upon 'em: al's faire prize you light on: I must away: your officer may give way To the Knavery of his watch, but must not see it. You all know where to finde me. Exit. Met. There look for us. Uit. Who's that? Mal. My Piorato, welcome, welcome: Faith had you not come when you did, my Lord Had done I know not what to me. Uit. I am gul'd, First cheated of my Jewels, and then laugh'd at: Sirha, what make you here? Pio. A businesse brings me, More lawfull then your own, Vit. How's that, you slave? Mal. He's such, that would continue his a whore Whom he would make a wife of. Uit. Ile trea'd upon The face you doat on, strumpet. Enter Clara. Pach. Keep the peace there. Vit. A plot upon my life too? Met. Down with him. Cla. Show your old valour, and learn from a woman, One Eagle has a world of odd's against A flight of Dawes, as these are. Pio. Get you off, Ile follow instantly. Pach. Run for more help there. Exeunt all but Uit. and Clara. Uit. Losse of my gold, &amp; jewels, &amp; the wench too Afflicts me not so much, as th'having Clara The witnesse of my weaknesse. Cla. He turns from me, And yet I may urge merit, since his life Is made my second gift. Uit. May I ne'r prosper If I know how to thank her. Cla. Sir, your pardon For pressing thus beyond a Virgins bounds Upon your privacies: and let my being Like to a man, as you are, be th'excuse Of my solliciting that from you, which shall not Be granted on my part, although desir'd By any other: sir; you understand me, And 'twould shew nobly in you, to prevent From me a farther boldnesse, which I must Proceed in, if you prove not mercifuil, Though with my losse of blushes, and good name. Uit. Madam, I know your wil, and would be thankfull If it were possible I could affect The Daughter of an enemy. Cla. That faire false one Whom with fond dotage you have long pursu'd Had such a father: she to whom you pay Deerer for your dishonour, then all titles Ambitious men hunt for are worth. Vit. 'Tis truth. Cla. Yet, with her, as a friend you still exchange Health for diseases, and to your disgrace Nourish the rivals to your present pleasures, At your own charge, us'd as a property To give a safe protection to her lust, Yet share in nothing but the shame of it. Uit. Grant all this so, to take you for a wife Were greater hazard, for should I offend you (As tis not easy still to please a woman) You are of so great a spirit, that I must learn To weare your petticoat, for you wil have My breeches from me. Cla. Rather from this houre I here abjure all actions of a man, And wil esteem it happinesse from you To suffer like a woman: love, true love Hath made a search within me, and expel'd All but my naturall softnesse, and made perfect That which my parents care could not begin. I wil show strength in nothing, but my duty, And glad desire to please you, and in that Grow every day more able. Uit. Could this be, What a brave race might I beget? I finde A kind of yeelding; and no reason why I should hold longer out: she's yong, and faire, And chast for sure, but with her leave the Devil Durst not attempt her: Madam, though you have A Souldiers arme, your lips appear as if They were a Ladies. Cla. They dare sir from you Endure the tryall. Uit. Ha: once more I pray you: The best I ever tasted; and tis said I have prov'd many, 'tis not safe I feare To aske the rest now: wel, I will leave whoring And luck herein send me with her: worthiest Lady, Ile wait upon you home, and by the way (If ere I marry, as ile not forswear it) Tell you, you are my wife. Cla. Which if you do, From me all man-kinde women, learne to woe. Exeunt. Scæna Tertia. Enter Alguazier, Pachieco, Metaldi, Mendoza, Lazarillo. Alg. A cloak? good purchase, and rich hangers? well, Wee'l share ten Pistolets a man Laz. Yet still I am monstrous hungry: could you not diduct So much out of the grosse some, as would purchase Eight loynes of Veale, and some two dozen of Capons? Pach. O strange proportion for five. Laz. For five? I have A legion in my stomach that have kept Perpetuall fast these ten years: for the Capons, They are to me but as so many black Birds: May I but eate once, and be satisfied, Let the fates call me, when my ship is fraught, And I shall hang in peace. Alg. Steale well to night, And thou shalt feed to morrow; so now you are Your selves againe, ile raise another watch To free you from suspition: set on any You meet with boldly: ile not be far off, T'assist you, and protect you. Exit. Met. O brave officer. Enter Alvarez, Lucio, Bobadilla. Pach. Would every ward had one but so well given, And we would watch for rug, in gownes of velvet. Mend. Stand close: a prize. Met. Satten, and gold Lace, Lads. Alv. Why do'st thou hang upon me? Luc. 'Tis so darke I dare not see my way: for heaven sake father Let us go home. Bob. No, ev'n here wee'l leave you: Let's run away from him, my Lord. Luc. Oh 'las. Alv. Thou hast made me mad: and I wil beat thee dead Then bray the in a morter, and now mold thee But I will alter thee. Bob. 'T will never be: He has bin three dayes practising to drink, Yet still he sips, like to a waiting woman, And looks as he were murdring of a fart Among wild Irish swaggerers. Luc. I have still Your good word, Zancho, father. Alv. Milk-sop coward; No house of mine receives thee: I disclaim thee, Thy mother; on her knees shall not entreat me Hereafter to acknowledge thee. Luc. Pray you speak for me. Bob. I would; but now I cannot with mine honour. Alv. Ther's only one course left, that may redeem thee, Which is, to strike the next man that you meet, And if we chance to light upon a woman, Take her away, and use her like a man, Or I wil cut thy hamstrings. Pach. This makes focus Alv. What do'st thou do now? Luc. Sir, I am saying my prayers; For being to undertake what you would have me, I know I cannot live. Enter Lamorall, Genevora, Anastro, and Pages with lights. Lam. Madam, I fear You'l wish you had usd your coach your brothers house Is yet far off. Gen. The better sir: this walk Will help digestion after your great supper, Of which I have fed largely. Alv. To your task, Or els you know what followes: Luc. I am dying: Now Lord have mercy on me: by your favour, Sir I must strike you. Lam. For what cause? Luc. I know not: And I must likewise talke with that young Lady, An houre in private. Lam. What you must, is doubtfull, But I am certain sir, I must beat you. Luc. Help, help. Alv. Not strik againe? Lam. How, Alvarez? An. This for my Lord Vitell's love. Pach. Break out, And like true theeves, make pray on either side, But seem to help the stranger. Bob. Oh my Lord, They have beat him on his knees. Luc. Though I want courage: I yet have a sons duty in me, and Compassion of a fathers danger; than, That wholy now possesses me. Alv. Lucio. This is beyond my hope. Met. So Lazarillo, Take up all boy: well done. Pach. And now steale off Closely, and cunningly. An. How? have I found you? Why Gentlemen, are you madde, to make your selves A prey to Rogues? Lam. Would we were off. Bob. Theeves, theeves. Lam. Defer our own contention: and down with them. Luc. Ile make you sure. Bob. Now he playes the Devil. Gen. This place is not for me. Exit. Luc. Ile follow her Half of my pennance is past ore. Exit. Enter Alguazier, Assistente and other Watches. Alg. What noyse? What tumult's there? keep the Kings peace I charge you. Pach. I am glad he's come yet. Alv. O, you keep good Guard Upon the City when men of our ranck Are set upon in the streetes. Lam. The assistance Shall heare of't be assur'd. An. And if he be That carefull Governour he is reported, You will smart for it. Alg. Patience, good Signiours: Let me survey the Rascals: O, I know them, And thank you for them: they are pillfring rogues Of Andaluzia, that have perus'd All Prisons in Castile: I dare not trust The dungeon with them: no, ile have them home To my own house. Pach. We had rather go to prison. Alg. Had you so dog-bolts? yes, I know you had: You there would use your cunning fingers on The simple locks; you would: but ile prevent you. Lam. My Mistris lost? good night. Exit. Bob. Your Son's gon to, What should become of him? Alv. Come of him, what will: Now he dares fight, I care not: i'le to bed: Look to your prisoners Alguazier. Exit with Boba. Alg. Al's cleer'd: Droop not for one disaster: let us hug, And triumph in our knaveries. Assist. This confirmes What was reported of him. Met. 'Twas done bravely. Alg. I must a little glory in the meanes We officers have, to play the Knaves, and safely: How we breake through the toyles, pitch'd by the Law, Yet hang up them that are far lesse delinquents: A simple shopkeeper's carted for a baud For lodging (though unwittingly) a smock-Gamster: Where, with rewards, and credit I have kept Malroda in my house as in a cloyster, Without taint, or suspition. Pach. But suppose The Governour should know't? Alg. He? good Gentleman, Let him perplex himself with prying into The measures in the market, and th'abuses The day stands guilty of the pillage of the night Is only mine, mine own feesimple; Which you shall hold from me, tennants at will, And pay no rent for't. Pach. Admirable Landlord. Alg. Now wee'l go search the taverns, commit such As we finde drinking: and be drunk our selves With what we take from them: these silly wretches Whom I for forme sake only have brought hither Shall watch without, and guard us. Assist. And we wil. See you safe lodg'd, most worthy Alguazier, With all of you his comrads. Met. Tis the Governour. Alg. We are betray'd? Assist. My guard there: bind them fast: How men in high place, and authority Are in their lives and estimation wrong'd By their subordinate Ministers? yet such They cannot but imploy: wrong'd justice finding Scarce one true servant in ten officers. 'T'xpostulate with you, were but to delay Your crimes due punishment, which shall fall upon you So speedily, and severely, that it shall Fright others by th'example: and confirme How ever corrupt officers may disgrace Themselves, 'tis not in them to wrong their place. Bring them away. Alg. Wee'l suffer nobly yet, And like to Spanish Gallants. Pach. And wee'l hang so. Laz. I have no stomach to it: but i'le endeavour. Exeunt. Scæna Quarta. Enter Lucio, and Genevora. Gen. Nay you are rude; pray you forbeare; your offer now More then the breeding of a Gentleman Can give you warrant for. Luc. Tis but to kisse you, And think not ile receive that for a favour Which was enjoyn'd me for a pennance, Lady. Gen. You have met a gentle confessor, and for once (So then you wil rest satisfied) I vouchsafe it. Luc. Rest satisfide with a kisse? why can a man Desire more from a woman? is there any Pleasure beyond it? may I never live If I know what it is. Gen. Sweet Innocence. Luc. VVhat a strange new motions do I feele? my veines Burn with an unknown fire: in every part I suffer alteration: I am poysond, Yet languish with desire againe to taste it, So sweetly it works on me. Gen. I ne'r saw A lovely man, till now. Luc. How can this be? She is a woman, as my mother is, And her I have kiss'd often, and brought off My lips unscortch'd; yours are more lovelie, Lady, And so should be lesse hurtfull: pray you vouchsafe Your hand, to quench the heat tane from your Lip, Perhaps that may restore me. Gen. VVillinglie. Luc. The flame increases: if to touch you, burne thus, VVhat would more strict embraces do? I know not, And yet methinks to die so, were to ascend To Heaven, through Paradise. Gen. I am wounded too, Though modesty forbids that I should speake VVhat ignorance makes him bold in: why do you fix Your eyes so stronglie on me? Luc. Pray you stand still, There is nothing els, that is worth the looking on: I could adore you, Ladie. Gen. Can you love mee? Luc. To waite on you, in your chamber, and but touch VVhat you, by wearing it, have made divine, Were such a happinesse. I am resov'd, Ile sell my libertie to you for this glove, And write my selfe your slave. Enter Lamorall. Gen. On easier termes, Receive it as a friend. Lam. How! giving favour! I'le have it with his heart. Gen. VVhat will you doe? Luc. As you are mercifull, take my life rather. Gen. VVill you depart with't so? Lam. Do's that grieve you? Gen. I know not: but even now you appeare valiant. Luc. Twas to preserve my father: in his cause I could be so again. Gen. Not in your own? Kneel to thy rivall and thine enemy? Away unworthy creature, I begin To hate my selfe, for giving entrance to A good opinion of thee: For thy torment, If my poore beauty be of any power, Mayst thou doat on it desperately: but never Presume to hope for grace, till thou recover And weare the favour that was ravish'd from thee. Lam. He weares my head to then. Gen. Poore foole, farewell. Exit. Luc. My womanish soul, which hitherto hath governd This coward flesh, I feele departing from me; And in me by her beauty is inspir'd A new, and masculine one: instructing me What's fit to doe or suffer; powerfull love That hast with loud, and yet a pleasing thunder Rous'd sleeping manhood in me, thy new creature, Perfect thy worke so that I may make known Nature (though long kept back) wil have her owne. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Scæna prima. Enter Lamorall and Lucio. Lam. Can it be possible, that in fix short houres The subject still the same, so many habits Should be remov'd? or this new Lucio, be That yesternight was baffeld and disgrac'd, And thankt the man that did it, that then kneeld And blubberd like a woman, should now dare One terme of honour seeke reparation For what he then appear'd not capable of? Luc. Such miracles, men that dare doe injuries Live to their shames to see, and for punishment And scourge to their proud follies. Lam. Prethee leave me: Had I my Page, or foot-man here to flesh thee, I durst the better heare thee. Luc. This scorn needs not: And offer such no more. Lam. Why say I should, You'l not be angry? Luc. Indeed I think I shal, Would you vouchsafe to shew your selfe a Captaine, And lead a little further, to some place That's lesse frequented. Lam. He looks pale. Luc. If not, Make use of this. Lam. There's anger in his eyes too: His gesture, voyce, and behaviour, all new fashion'd; Wel, if it does endure in act the triall Of what in show it promises to make good, Ulysses Cyclops, Io's transformation, Eurydice fetcht from Hell, with all the rest Of Ovids Fables, ile put in your Creed; And for proofe, all incredible things may be Writ down that Lucio, the coward Lucio, The womanish Lucio fought. Luc. and Lamorall, The stil imployd great duellist Lamorall Took his life from him. Lam. Twill not come to that sure: Methinks the onely drawing of my Sword Should fright that confidence. Luc. It confirmes it rather. To make which good, know you stand now oppos'd By one that is your Rivall, one that wishes Your name and title greater, to raise his; The wrong you did, lesse pardonable then it is, But your strength to defend it, more then ever It was when justice friended it. The Lady For whom we now contend, Genevora Of more desert, (if such incomparable beauty Could suffer an addition) your love To Don Vitelli multipli'd, and your hate A against my father and his house increas'd; And lastly, that the Glove which you there wear, To my dishonour, (which I must force from you) Were deerer to you then your life. Lam. You'l finde It is, and so ile guard it: Luc. All these meet then With the black infamy, to be foyld by one That's not allowd a man: to help your valour, That falling by your hand, I may, or die, Or win in this one single opposition My Mistris, and such honour as I may Inrich my fathers Armes with. Lam. Tis said Nobly; My life with them are at the stake. Luc. At all then. Fight. Lam. She's yours: this, and my life, to follow your fortune; And give not onely back that part the looser Scorns to accept of— Luc. What's that? Lam. My poor life, Which do not leave me as a further torment, Having dispoild me of my Sword, mine honour, Hope of my Ladies grace, fame, and all else That made it worth the keeping. Luc. I take back No more from you, then what you forc'd from me; And with a worser title: yet think not That Ile dispute this, as made insolent By my successe, but as one equall with you, If so you wil accept me; that new courage, Or call it fortune if you please, that is Confer'd upon me by the only sight Of fair Genevora, was not bestow'd on me To bloody purposes: nor did her command Deprive me of the happinesse to see her But till I did redeem her favour from you; Which onely I rejoyce in, and share with you In all you suffer else. Lam. This curtesie Wounds deeper then your Sword can, or mine owne; Pray you make use of either, and dispatch me. Luc. The barbarous Turke is satisfied with spoile; And shall I, being possest of what I came for, Prove the more Infidell? Lam. You were better be so, Then publish my disgrace, as tis the custome, And which I must expect. Luc. Judge better on me: I have no tongue to trumpet mine owne praise To your dishonour: tis a bastard courage That seekes a name out that way, no true born one; Pray you be comforted, for by all goodnesse But to her vertuous selfe, the best part of it, I never wil discover on what termes I came by these: which yet I take not from you, But leave you in exchange of them, mine own, With the desire of being a friend; which if You will not grant me but on further triall Of manhood in me, seeke me when you please, (And though I might refuse it with mine honour) Win them again, and weare them: so good morrow. Exit. Lam. I nere knew what true valour was till now; And have gain'd more by this disgrace, then all The honours I have won: they made me proud, Presumptuous of my fortune; a meere beast, Fashion'd by them, onely to dare and doe: Yeelding no reasons for my wilfull actions But what I stuck on my Swords point, presuming It was the best Revenew. How unequall Wrongs wel maintain'd makes us to others, which Ending with shame teach us to know our selves, I wil think more on't. Enter Uitelli. Vit. Lamorall. Lam. My Lord? Vit. I came to seeke you. Lam. And unwillingly; You nere found me till now: your pleasure sir? Vit. That which wil please thee friend: thy vowd love to me Shall now be put in action: means is offer'd To use thy good Sword for me; that which still Thou wearst, as if it were a part of thee. Where is it? Lam. Tis changd for one more fortunate: Pray you enquire not how. Vit. Why, I nere thought That there was musick int, but ascribe The fortune of it to the arme. Lam. Which is grown weaker too. I am not (in a word) Worthy your friendship: I am one new vanquish'd, Yet shame to tell by whom. Vit. But Ile tell thee 'Gainst whom thou art to fight, and there redeeme Thy honour lost, if there be any such: The King, by my long suit, at length is pleas'd That Alvarez and my self, with eithers Second, Shall end the difference between our houses, Which he accepts of I make choice of thee; And where you speak of a disgrace, the means To blot it out, by such a publique triall Of thy approved valour, wil revive Thy ancient courage. If you imbrace it, doe; If not, Ile seeke some other. Lam. As I am You may command me. Vit. Spoke like that true friend That loves not onely for his private end. Exeunt. Scæna secunda. Enter Genevora with a Letter and Bobadilla. Gen. This from Madona Clara? Bob. Yes, and't please you. Gen. Alvarez daughter? Bob. The same, Lady. Gen. She, That sav'd my brothers life? Bob. You are still in the right, She wil'd me wait your walking forth: and knowing How necessary a discreet wise man Was in a businesse of such weight, she pleas'd To think on me: it may be in my face Your Ladiship not acquainted with my wisdome Finds no such matter: what I am, I am; Thought's free: and think you what you please. Gen. Tis strange, Bob. That I should be wise, Madam? Gen. No, thou art so; There's for thy paines: and prethee tell thy Lady I wil not faile to meet her: Ile receive Thy thanks and duty in thy present absence: Farewell, farewel, I say, now thou art wise. Exit Bob. She writes here, she hath something to impart That may concerne my brothers life; I know not, But generall fame does give her out so worhty, That I dare not suspect her: yet wish Lucio Enter Lucio. Were Master of her mind: but fie upon't; Why do I think on him? see, I am punish'd for it, In his unlookd for presence: Now I must Endure another tedious piece of Courtship, Would make one forswear curtesie. Luc. Gracious Madam, The sorrow paid for your just anger towards me Arising from my weaknesse, I presume To presse into your presence, and dispaire not An easie pardon. Gen. He speaks sence: oh strange. Luc. And yet believe, that no desire of mine, Though all are too strong in me, had the power For their delight, to force me to iufringe What you commanded, it being in your pars To lessen your great rigour when you please, And mine to suffer with an humble patience What you'l impose upon it. Gen. Courtly too. Luc. Yet hath the poore, and contemn'd Lucio, Madam, (Made able onely by his hope to serve you) Recover'd what with violence, not justice, Was taken from him: and here at your feet With these, he could have laid the conquer'd head Of Lamorall (tis all I say of him) For rudely touching that, which as a relique I ever would have worship'd, since twas yours. Gen. Valiant, and every thing a Lady could Wish in her servant. Luc. All that's good in me, That heavenly love, the opposite to base lust, Which would have all men worthy, hath created; Which being by your beames of beauty form'd, Cherish as your own creature. Gen. I am gone Too far now to dissemble: rise, or sure I must kneele with you too: let this one kisse Speake the rest for me: tis too much I doe, And yet, if chastity would, I could with more. Luc. In overjoying me, you are grown sad; What is it Madam? by— There's nothing that's within my nerves (and yet Favour'd by you, I should as much as man) But when you please, now or on all occasions You can think of hereafter, but you may Dispose of at your pleasure. Gen. If you breake That oath again, you lose me. Yet so wel I love you, I shall never put you to't; And yet forget it not: rest satisfied With that you have receiv'd now: there are eyes May be upon us, till the difference Between our friends are ended: I would not Be seen so private with you. Luc. I obey you. Gen. But let me heare oft from you, and remember I am Vitellies sister. Luc. What's that Madam? Gen.

Forasmuch as our high and mighty Master, Philip, the potent and most Catholique King of Spaine, hath not onely in his own Royall person, been long, and often sollicited, and grieved, with the deadly and uncurable hatred, sprung up betwixt the two ancient and most honourably discended Houses of these his two deerely and equally beloved Subjects, Don Ferdinando de Alvarez, and Don Pedro de Vitelli: (all which in vaine his Majesty hath often endeavoured to reconcile and qualifie:) But that also through the debates, quarrels, and outrages daily arising, falling, and flowing from these great heads, his publique civill Government is seditiously and barbarously molested and wounded, and many of his chiefe Gentry (no lesse tender to his Royall Majesty then the very branches of his own sacred blood) spoyld, lost, and submerged, in the impious inundation and torrent of their still-growing malice: It hath therefore pleased His sacred Majesty, out of His infinite affection to preserve his Common wealth, and generall peace, I from farther violation, (as a sweet and heartily loving father of his people) and on the earnest petitions of these Arch-enemies, to Order, and Ordaine, That they be ready, each with his wel-chosen and beloved friend, arm'd at all points like Gentlemen, in the Castle of St. Jago, on this present Munday morning betwixt eight and nine of the clocke; where (before the combatants be allowed to commence this granted Duell) This to be read aloud for the publique satisfaction of his Majesties welbeloved Subjects. 'Save the King. Drums within. Say. Hark how their Drums speak their insatiate thirst Of blood, and stop their eares 'gainst pious peace, Who gently whispering, implores their friendship? Assis. Kings, nor authority can master fate; Admit 'em then, and blood extinguish hate. Enter severally, Alvarez and Lucio, Vitelli and Lamora. Say. Stay, yet be pleasd to think, and let not daring Wherein men nowadaies exceed even beasts, And think themselves not men else, so transport you Beyond the bounds of Christianity: Lord Alvarez, Vitelli, Gentlemen, No Town in Spaine, from our Metropolis Unto the rudest hovell, but is great With your assured valours daily proofes: Oh wil you then, for a superfluous fame, A sound of honour, which in these times, all Like heretiques professe (with obstinacy) But most erroneously, venture your soules, Tis a hard tasque, thorough a Sea of blood To saile, and land at Heaven? Vit. I hope not If justice be my Pilot: but my Lord, You know, if argument, or time, or love, Could reconcile, long since we had shook hands; I dare protest, your breath cooles not a veine In any one of us, but blowes the fire Which nought but blood reciprocall can quench. Alv. Vitelli, thou sayst bravely, and sayst right, And I will kill thee for't, I love thee so. Vit. Ha, ha, old man: upon thy death Ile build A story (with this arme) for thy old wife To tell thy daughter Clara seven yeeres hence As she sits weeping by a wintet fire, How such a time Vitelli slew her husband With the same Sword his daughter favour'd him, And lives, and weares it yet: Come Lamorall, Redeeme thy selfe. Lam. Lucio, Genevora Shall on this Sword receive thy bleeding heart, For my presented hat, laid at her feet. Luc. Thou talkst wel Lamorall, but tis thy head That I wil carry to her to thy hat: Fie father, I do coole too much. Alv. Oh boy: Thy fathers true sonne: Beat Drums,—and so good morrow to your Lordship. Enter above Eugenia, Clara, Genevora. Say. Brave resolutions. Anast. Brave, and Spanish right. Gen. Lucio. Cla. Vitelli. Eug. Alvarez. Alv. How the devill Got these Cats into th'gutter? my puffe too? Eug. Heare us. Gen. We must be heard. Cla. We will be heard Vitelli; looke, see Clara on her knees Imploring thy compassion: Heaven, how sternly They dart their emulous eyes, as if each scorn'd To be behind the other in a look! Mother, death needs no Sword here: oh my sister (Fate faine would have it so) perswade, entreat, A Ladies teares are silent Orators (Or should be so at least) to move beyond The honest tongu'd-Rethoritian: Why will you fight? why do's an uncles death Twentie yeare old, exceed your love to me But twentie daies? whose forc'd cause, and faire manner You could not understand, onely have heard. Custome, that wrought so cunningly on nature In me, that I forgot my sex, and knew not Whether my body femall were, or male, You did unweave, and had the power to charme A new creation in me, made me feare To think on those deeds I did perpetrate, How little power though you allow to me That cannot with my sighes, my teares, my prayers Move you from your own losse, if you shoule gaine. Vit. I must forget you Clara, 'till I have Redeem'd my uncles blood, that brands my face Like a pestiferous Carbuncle: I am blinde To what you doe: deafe to your cries: and Marble To all impulsive exorations. When on this point, I have pearch'd thy fathers soule, Ile tender thee this bloody reeking hand Drawne forth the bowels of that murtherer: If thou canst love me then, i'le marry thee, And for thy father lost, get thee a Sonne; On no condition else. Assist. Most barbarous. Say. Savage. Anast. Irreligious. Gen. Oh Lucio! Be thou more mercifull: thou bear'st fewer yeers, Art lately wean'd from soft effeminacy, A maidens manners, and a maidens heart Are neighbours still to thee: be then more milde, Proceed not to this combat; bee'st thou desperate Of thine owne life? yet (deerest) pitty mine Thy valour's not thine owne, I gave it thee, These eyes begot it, this tongue bred it up, This breast would lodge it: doe not use my gifts To mine own ruine: I have made thee rich, Be not so thanklesse, to undoe me for't. Luc. Mistresse, you know I doe not weare a vaine. I would not rip for you, to doe you service: Life's but a word, a shadow, a melting dreame, Compar'd to essentiall, and eternall honour. Why, would you have me value it beyond Your brother: if I first cast down my sword May all my body here, be made one wound, And yet my soule not finde heaven thorough it. Alv. You would be carter-walling too, but peace, Goe, get you home, and provide dinner for Your Sonne, and me: we'l be exceeding merry: Oh Lucio, I will have thee cock of all The proud Vitellies that doe live in Spaine: Fie, we shall take cold: hunch:—I am hoarse Already. Lam. How your Sister whets my spleene! I could eate Lucio now: Gen. Lamorall: you have often sworne You'ld be commanded by me. Gen. Vitelli, Brother, Ev'n for your Fathers soule, your uncles blood, As you doe love my life: but last, and most As you respect your own Honour, and Fame, Throw downe your sword; he is most valiant That herein yeelds first. Vit. Peace, you foole. Cla. Why Lucio, Doe thou begin; 'tis no disparagement: He's elder, and thy better, and thy valour Is in his infancy. Gen. Or pay it me, To whom thou ow'st it: Oh, that constant time Would but goe back a week, then Lucio Thou would'st not dare to fight. Eug. Lucio, thy Mother, Thy Mother beggs it: throw thy sword down first. Alv. Ile throw his head downe after then. Gen. Lamorall. You have often swore you'ld be commanded by me. Lam. Never to this: your spight, and scorn Genevora, H'as lost all power in me: Gen. Your hearing for six words. Ass., Say., An. Strange obstinacy! Al. Vit. Lu. Lam. We'l stay no longer. Cla. Then by thy oath Vitelli, Thy dreadfull oath, thou wouldst returne that sword When I should aske it, give it to me, now, This instant I require it. Gen. By thy vow, As dreadfull, Lucio, to obey my will In any one thing I would watch to challenge, I charge thee not to strike a stroake: now he Of our two brothers that loves perjurie Best, and dares first be damn'd, infringe his vow. Say. Excellent Ladies. Vit. Pish you tyrannize. Luc. We did equivocate. Alv. On. Cla. Then Lucio, So well I love my husband, for he is so, (wanting but ceremony) that I pray His vengefull sword may fall upon thy head succesfully for false-hood to his Sister. Gen. I likewise pray (Vitelli) Lucio's sword (who equally is my husband, as thou hers) May finde thy false heart, that durst gage thy faith, And durst not keepe it. Assist. Are you men, or stone. Alv. Men, and we'l prove it with our swords: Eug. Your hearing, for six words, and we have done, Zancho come forth—we'l fight our challenge too. Enter Bobadilla with two swords and a Pistoll. Now speake your resolutions. Gen. These they are, The first blow given betwixt you, sheathes these swords In one anothers bosomes. Eug. And rogue, looke You at that instant doe discharge that Pistoll Into my breast: if you start back, or quake, Ile stick you like a Pigge. Alv. —hold: you are mad. Gen. This we said: and by our hope of blisse This we will doe: speake your intents. Cla., Gen. Strike. Eug. Shoot. Al., Vit., Lu., La. Hold, hold: all friends. Assist. Come downe. Alv. These devillish women Can make men friends and enemies when they list. Say. A gallant undertaking and a happie; Why this is noble in you: and will be A well comer present to our Master Philip Then the returne from his Indies. Enter Clara, Genevora Eugenia and Bobadilla. Cla. Father your blessing. Alv. Take her: if he bring not Betwixt you, boyes that will finde out new worlds, And win 'em too I'm a false Prophet. Vit. Brother. There is a Sister: long divided streames Mix now at length, by fate. Bob. I am not regarded: I was the carefull Steward that provided these Instruments of peace, I put the longest weapon in your Sisters hand, (my Lord) because she was the shortest Lady: For likely the shortest Ladies, love the longest—men: And for mine own part, I could have discharged it: my Pistoll is no ordinary Pistoll, it has two ramming Bullets; but thought I, why should I shoot my two bullets into my old Lady? if they had gon, I would not have staid long after: I would ev'n have died too, bravely y'faith, like a Roman-Steward: hung my selfe in mine owne Chaine, and there had been a story of Bobadilla, Spindola, Zanebo, for after ages to lament: hum: I perceive I am not onely not regarded, but also not rewarded. Alv, Prethee peace: 'shalt have a new chaine, next Saint Iaques day, or this new gilt: Bob. I am satisfied: let vertue have her due: And yet i am melancholy upon this atonement: pray heaven the State rue it not: I would my Lord Vitellies Steward, and I could meet: they should finde it should cost 'em a little more to make us friends: well, I will forsweare wine, and women for a yeere: and then I will be drunk to morrow, and runne a whoring like a dogge with a broken bottle at's taile; then will I repent next day, and forsweare 'em againe more vehemently: be for-sworne next day againe, and repent my repentance: for thus a melancholy Gentleman doth, and ought to live. Assist. Nay, you shall dine with me: and afterward Ile with 'ye to the King: But first, I will Dispatch the Castles businesse, that this day May be compleat. Bring forth the malefactors. Enter Alguazier, Pachieco, Metaldi, Mendoza, Lazaril. You Alguazier, the Ringleader of these Poore fellowes, are degraded from your office, You must restore all stolne goods you receiv'd, And watch a twelve moneth without any pay: This, if you faile of, (all your goods confiscate) You are to be whipt, and sent into the Gallies. Piorato, Malroda &amp; Guard. Alg. I like all, but restoring that Catholique doctrine I doe dislike: Learn all ye officers By this to live uprightly (if you can) Exit. Assist. You Cobler, to translate your manners new, Are doom'd to th'Cloyster of the Mendicants, With this your brother, botcher there, for nothing To cobble, and heel hose for the poor Friers, Till they allow your pennance for sufficient, And your amendment; then you shall be freed, And may set up againe, Pach. Mendoza, come. Our soules have trod awry in all mens sight, We'l underlay 'em, till they goe upright. Exit. Pach. &amp; Mend. Assist. Smith, in those shackles you for your hard heart Must lye by th'heeles a yeer. Met. I have shod your horse, my Lord. Exit. Assist. Away: for you, my hungry white-loaf'd face, You must to th'Gallies, where you shall be sure To have no more bits, then you shall have blowes. Laz. Well, though herrings want, I shall have rowes. Assist. Signior, you have prevented us, and punish'd Your selfe severelier then we would have done. You have married a whore: may she prove honest. Pio. 'Tis better my Lord, then to marry an honest woman That may prove a whore. Vit. 'Tis a hansome wench: and thou canst keepe her tame: Ile send you what I promis'd. Pio. Joy to your Lordships. Alv. Here may all Ladies learne, to make of foes The perfect'st friends: and not the perfect'st foes Of deerest friends, as some doe now a dayes. Vit. Behold the power of love, to nature lost By custome irrecoverably, past the hope Of friends restoring, love hath here retriv'd To her own habit, made her blush to see Her so long monstrous metamorphoses, May strange affaires never have worse successe.

      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Ovr Auhor feares there are some Rebell hearts, Whose dulnesse doth oppose loves peircing darts; Such will be apt to say there wanted wit, The language low, very few scænes are writ With spirit and life; such odde things as these He cares not for, nor ever meanes to please; For if your selves a Mistresse or loves friends, Are lik't with this smooth Play he hath his ends.

      <field name="fulltext">A PROLOGUE At the reviving of this Play. Statues and Pictures challenge price and fame; If they can justly boast, and prove they came From Phidias or Apelles. None deny, Poets and Painters hold a sympathy; Yet their workes may decay and lose their grace, Receiving blemish in their limbs or face. When the minds art has this preheminence, She still retaineth her first excellence. Then why should not this deere peece be esteem'd Child to the richest fancies that ere teem'd? When not their meanest off-spring, that came forth, But bore the image of their fathers worth. Beaumonts, and Fletchers, whose desert outwayes The best applause, and their least sprig of Bayes Is worthy Phæbus; and who comes to gather Their fruits of wit, he shall not rob the treasure. Nor can you ever surfeit of the plenty, Nor can you call them rare, though they be dainty: The more you take, the more you do them right, And wee will thanke you for your own delight.</field>
