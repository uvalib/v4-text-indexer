Constantia de Sylveyra, Mother of the Young Officer who bears that name. Velora, the Bramin's Daughter. Paneea, an Indian attendant. Portugueze Guards, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENEâTHE CITY OF GOA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. VELORA, Discovered in an Indian dress and a pensive attitude, with a book: after a short pause. Thou mild divinity! persuasive power! Thou guide and glory of our Christian rulers! Protect thy secret votary! I read Thy clear unquestioned truth, thy matchless mercy In all my fate, and in the heavenly mind Of my brave guardian, my beloved Sylveyra: Yet pardon me, thou pure, indulgent power! That still to India's unenlightened worship I pay a forced observance! O forgive This filial heart, whose only fallacy Aims to ensure an aged father's peace. SCENE II. CONSTANTIA, VELORA. CONSTANTIA, (entering.) Still at thy orisons! my dear Velora; Good angels waft thy every vow to Heaven, And plead for purity so like their own! VELORA. Then will they teach me to repay your kindness, And all the bounty of your generous son, Which soothed my woes, and makes captivity, Beneath your provident parental care, More sweet than freedom. CONSTANTIA. In thy glowing heart, My lovely Indian, like thy genial clime, Rich nature reigns; thy gratitude o'er-rates Compassion's casual services. VELORA. Your pardon! To rate them justly is my reason's pride: Hence memory paints them in her strongest colours: I see the furious sons of Portugal, Roused to fierce anger on Cambaya's shore By Moorish fraud, and our perfidious king; I see them, bursting like a flood of fire Athwart our peaceful grove, where fixt we listened To the mild precepts of our aged sire: The ruffian soldiers in his hoary locks Twist their fell hands; and with uplifted falchions Demand his hidden treasure. CONSTANTIA. What a scene For thy soft filial heart! VELORA. The holy Bramin Pleads only for his child:âthe furious robbers Tear from my neck the strings of precious pearl, Threatening worse violence:âbut swift to save us The blest Sylveyra comes. CONSTANTIA. 'Twas Heaven, that sent him In pity to thy virtues. VELORA. His bright eye Flashes rebuke; and at his awful mandate Keen avarice and murder shrink abashed, As from the presence of an angry God. CONSTANTIA. Thy flattering picture charms a mother's heart. VELORA. O! had you heard with what angelic sweetness He banished terror from our troubled minds! Music is harsh to that consoling voice: He raised us from despair: he kindly promised To place my father, and his helpless child In the protecting walls of distant Goa. CONSTANTIA. Tho' difficult the task, he has achieved it, And thy full gratitude exceeds his bounty. VELORA. No! dear Constantia! why is Heaven adored, But for such blessings, as I owe to him? Is he not all maternal love can wish? CONSTANTIA. Yes! my Velora, with a conscious pride I watched his youth, have seen the richest bloom Of honor, glowing on his ripened spirit: O! how unlike his sex! those hypocrites, Who humbly bend to innocence and beauty, But cover falsehood with devotion's mask! VELORA. What injuries excite thy gentle nature To these severer thoughts? CONSTANTIA. In some fit hour I will unfold to thee a wretched story, Touching the cruel father of Sylveyra, That will amaze thy tenderness, and make E'en the warm current of thy glowing veins Run cold with horror: but thy present danger Claims, dear Velora, our immediate care: Thou'rt still a captive; still a Bramin's daughter. VELORA. O! do not think that even love can tempt Velora to forget her filial duties, And wound the bosom of an aged father, Who watched unceasing o'er her early youth, Nor asked existence, but to guard his child! I know how firmly his pure heart is wedded To all our ancient rites; and that his spirit Would rather give me to the tomb, much rather, Than yield his daughter to a foreign hand; That worst pollution to the race of Brama! CONSTANTIA. When first my generous son, beneath my care Placed thee, a lovely captive, I observed His growing passion with a mother's fears: But charmed, Velora, by thy winning sweetness, I own I gazed upon your chaste affections With such pure joy, as the good angels felt, When first o'er Eden's infant bowers they hovered, And fondly viewed the new created pair, While innocence and love were all their portion: Yet still there's danger, lest ye should imbitter The virtuous Bramin's closing eve of life: Canst thou believe thy love will long elude The quick observance of an anxious father? VELORA. Alas! too soon will that unhappy father, Worn out with age, the martyr of affliction, Be severed from the idol of his care: One dying wish he formed, and thy dear son Has nobly promised to restore his captives Safe to their native seat: 'tis there my father Yet hopes to purify his parting soul: There will I tend his short remains of life, Calm all his fears, and sooth his latest pang. CONSTANTIA. O! thou dear paragon of filial duty! Blest be thy every purpose! but my child, I have yet heavier fears! VELORA. Whate'er they are, O! yet awhile suppress them! for behold My father bends his feeble steps towards us. SCENE III. CONSTANTIA, VELORA, PERSOD. PERSOD. May mighty Brama, and his purest spirits Watch o'er our gentle friend, whose pitying eyes Have looked so kindly on an old man's sorrows, And this sole treasure of his trembling age! Has aught yet reached thee from our dear protector, Thy gallant son? CONSTANTIA. No! venerable sire, He's yet engaged upon the neigbouring shore To treat with fiercest foes, with whom, I fear, His sword must arbitrate: protect him Heaven! PERSOD. Such prayers are mine: nor can thy bosom feel A dearer interest in his precious life. VELORA. Still let us cherish hope! nor yield our hearts To false suggestions of ill-grounded fear! If the mild works of peace demand his presence, Does not persuasion, dwelling in his voice, Assure us of success? if cruel war Call him reluctant to the fields of blood, Where'er he turns, does not resistless valour Guide the keen lightning of his conquering sword, And victory guard him, with her golden wings? PERSOD. Alas! my child, a more immediate terror Has seized my trembling heart: thou know'st, the Viceroy Saw thee attendant on my helpless age: He dwelt upon thy beauties with an eye Of fierce desire. CONSTANTIA, (aside.) Good Heaven! it was my fear. VELORA. O! my kind father, from thy fondness springs This vain surmise; for is not mighty Castro Most noble, generous, merciful, and just? PERSOD. The purest virtue melts in passion's flame, When boundless power appears a ready pander To every wild desire: where is our refuge, Defenceless as we are? CONSTANTIA. Unhappy father? PERSOD. Wilt thou assure my trembling heart, that when These dim eyes close in death, thou wilt protect My child, nor yield her to his guilty passion! CONSTANTIA. Hear me thou good old man! before the throne Of Heaven's great father kneeling, thus I swear, By all the sorrows, I have known myself, And by the recompense, my soul expects For all its sufferings, in a purer world, I will protect thy daughter as my own. PERSOD. Enough! enough! O! let me wound no more Thy tender bosom, with an old man's terrors! I will retire; and pray the gracious Brama, To aid the virtuous purpose of thy soul. VELORA. Let thy Velora on thy steps attend! PERSOD. No! my sweet child! rest with thy gentle friend! I go to bend before the lord of life, The one, that ever was, and to implore him, That in what form soe'er he deigns to clothe My parting spirit, it may still be near thee; And in these dangers, that my fondness dreads, Still hover round thee, and preserve my child. (Exit. SCENE IV. CONSTANTIA, VELORA. CONSTANTIA. O thou unfortunate! if Castro love thee, Farewell to all our peace, for in his love Lies misery and ruin! VELORA. Is he not The noble character, that fame reports him? CONSTANTIA. Yes! my Velora, when his manly spirit Appears unsullied by the mists of passion, It is the very mirror, that presents The perfect form of honor.âYet beware! If ever Castro speak to thee of love, Drop not a word, from which he may collect Thy fond attachment to Sylveyra's virtues, For if thy beauties have inflamed the Viceroy, (I know his nature) 'twill be jealous passion, And frantic as the tyger o'er his prey, Whose fierce suspicion, and whose fell revenge, Would drink the life-blood of his fellow savage, For daring but to look on'tâtrust my care! And keep this counsel treasured in thy heart! SCENE V. VELORA, THE VICEROY. THE VICEROY, (entering) (aside...) Alone by all my wishes! her soft bosom By pensive solitude prepared for love! (... aside.) Can we not teach the beautiful Velora To lose the memory of Cambaya's shore In the gay pleasures of our sumptuous city? Will young Sylveyra rob us of those charms, And to her desolated country bear His lovely charge? VELORA. My lord, his word is past. THE VICEROY. Who, that from ocean's dangerous depths had brought A pearl of such pure lustre, would throw back The peerless gem? VELORA. That pity, which alone Inspired the brave Sylveyra to protect, And lead us to this realm, will prompt him still To crown the just hopes of an aged exile. My heart, my lord, can form no dearer wish, Than to attend my father's injured age: This sacred duty calls me, and must plead My pardon with your highness. THE VICEROY. Stay, Velora! VELORA. My lord! my lord! release me! nor oppress A helpless captive! THE VICEROY. By my life I worship Thy wonderous charms: It is my heart's ambition To court the kindness of thy gentle bosom: If thou wilt meet the passion of my soul, My proud affection will delight to throw The richest splendors of dominion round thee, And make thy station, like thy matchless beauty, The gaze and envy of this Eastern world! VELORA. Reflect, my lord, that filial cares alone Claim, and possess Velora's every thought! THE VICEROY. No more, thou lovely coy one! force no more From those soft lips such ill-agreeing sounds, While every beauty in thy blushing form, With all the energy of warm expression Tells nobler truths, more consonant to nature; While these enchanting eyes inflame my soul, And sparkle promises of bliss too high For human voice to utter. In my arms Come let me clasp thee! VELORA. O! forbear, my lord! Nor force me to alarm an aged father! I must retire: and may the God you serve, Instruct your cooler reason to renounce These fatal thoughts! (Exit. THE VICEROY, (alone.) O! thou luxuriant beauty! Thou must be mine, for all thy weak resistance Is like the failing mound, that art would raise To stop the rising billows. SCENE VI. THE VICEROY, GARCIA. THE VICEROY. What would Garcia? GARCIA. My Lord, I bring great news: our foes are scattered, The brave Sylveyra has dislodged the Moors. THE VICEROY. Now blest be Portugal's protecting saint! The young Sylveyra gallantly pursues The example of his race. GARCIA. Yet, noble Castro, We see thee tempted from the paths of fame By love's illusive fire:âtho' thy great soul Should, like the Eagle, keep its native height, And scorn to gaze but on the beams of glory. THE VICEROY. O Garcia, I regard with envious wonder The steady virtues of thy happier mind: No rebel passions can dethrone thy reason; Mine is the slave of appetite: I feel My blind attachment to this lovely Indian Death to my peace, and poison to my fame, Yet doat on my perdition: ne'er did passion Reign so despotic in my subject heart, Since our young days, when my disastrous love Deprived the injured Isabel of life. GARCIA. Tho' all her sorrows have so long been buried, Her fate still touches me, and to this hour I curse her cruel father; whose proud soul Crushed the fair hopes of your appointed nuptials, And sunk his wounded daughter to the grave; Tho' rumour whispers that her death was feigned. THE VICEROY. O! couldst thou bring that martyred saint to life, Then might I worship thee: No! Garcia, no! 'Twas not her father; 'twas my fury killed her, The jealous fury of a mind distracted. In some convenient season, I will tell thee All the past crimes, and frenzy of my life, For thou wilt turn them to my preservation; Thy generous counsel will oft set before me My madness past; by friendship's guardian power Wean my weak spirit from its present passion, And save me from myself:âbut see Molina. SCENE VII. THE VICEROY, GARCIA, MOLINA. THE VICEROY. Now, Garcia, haste, and summon to our presence The wretched parent of this gallant victor! For years secluded in domestic sorrow: I have not seen her, but we now have tidings, That will instruct e'en grief itself to smile. (Exit Garcia. Say! is this brilliant victory dearly bought By our brave soldiers' blood?âwhom have we lost? MOLINA. Never did Portugal's prevailing bands Obtain such vantage at a cheaper rate. SCENE VIII. THE VICEROY, MOLINA; GARCIA entering with CONSTANTIA, and VELORA, in veils. THE VICEROY. Still, gentle lady, in the veil of sorrow! Thy son's exploits shall turn these mourning weeds To robes of triumph:ânow, Molina, speak The deeds of this young conqueror! MOLINA. Our foes, Who on the neighbouring hills encamped apart, Disclaimed all treaty; threatening e'en the siege Of this imperial city: with this aim The artful Renegado had assembled All the confederate princes in a fort On the adjacent shore, whose chosen guard Trebled our scanty number: by surprise The brave Sylveyra made a fierce attack; Twice to the earth he struck the base Coutino, And slew the author of this dangerous league. THE VICEROY. By Heaven this action binds him to my heart. CONSTANTIA. Great God of battles! to thy throne I bend And thank thee with my tears. MOLINA. Beside that traitor, The Moorish Chieftain fell: instant dismay Seized all their host; and infinite had been The general slaughter, but the just Sylveyra Proclaimed free pardon to the native Indians. VELORA. Reward him for it, all ye host of heaven, Who teach him still to emulate your nature, And be the guardian of a fallen race! MOLINA. This well-timed mercy ratified our conquest; And, the great business of his mission ended, Ere now Sylveyra is embarked for Goa. THE VICEROY. He shall have noble welcome. Gentle mourner! Let every trace of your past grief be lost, In the gay triumph of your gallant son! CONSTANTIA. Your generous kindness to a mother claims Her praise, but my full heart can only thank you With silence, and with tears. (Exit with Velora. THE VICEROY. Molina haste! And bid our Citizens with festive triumph Meet this young Victor! (Exit Molina. Garcia, though I love him. As if he were my son, for he inherits The noble virtues of our vauled friend, Yet my heart tells me, his return portends I know not what of ill.âDidst thou observe With what a fond idolatry of praise The warm Velora magnified his mercy? GARCIA. O! my dear lord! remember, that we stand Upon enchanted ground! hence, let us fly! Then may I clear your heart, that field of honor, From weeds of love and jealousy, whose growth Would choke the harvest of your rich renown. THE VICEROY. Yes! honest Garcia, thou shalt freely use A right inherent in a soul like thine; Search, and correct, my foibles, till thy friend Shall bless thee as the guardian of his glory. (Exeunt. SCENE IX. CONSTANTIA, (entering alone.) At length he's gone; and my o'erburdened heart May vent its perturbation: cruel Castro! How has thy presence wakened all my wrongs, Yet with them all my love! O! did not memory Still haunt me with thy base neglect and scorn, How would my heart again embrace delusion, And idolize thy nobleness of nature! Shall I, as if ascending from the grave, Burst like a spectre on thy aching sight, And while thou'rt lost in horror and amazement, Speak transport to thee in soul-piercing sounds, And fondly cry, Sylveyra is thy son?â Perhaps the hardened heart, that could endure To leave his infant innocence an outcast, Might still disclaim the offspring, it deserted; And shall I court thy pride to own thy child? Save me from such abasement! my proud soul Its secret shall retain:âin my last hour I will amaze thee with a wondrous tale, And teach the libertine, the cruel father, To melt, and to revere the sacred force Of female virtue, and maternal love!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. THE PALACE OF THE VICEROY. THE VICEROY, SYLVEYRA. THE VICEROY. Yes! thou bright mirror of our martial youth, In thy brave deeds, which make the veteran's cheek Turn pale with envy, my exulting heart Feels a paternal joy:âBut O! Sylveyra, I draw thee now from festive admiration To speak of doubts, that prey upon my peace, And ask thy private aid. SYLVEYRA. I hold my life Of value, only as it may repay Your generous bounty to my orphan youth. THE VICEROY. Thy much loved guardian lives again in thee, Thou art the perfect image of his valour; And O! thou gallant youth, I hope to find The very spirit of his friendship in thee; Warm, active, generous; proud to sacrifice His own most eager purpose, to promote The dearer interest of the man he loved: Have I a right, Sylveyra, to expect Such services from thee? SYLVEYRA. Wrong not, my lord, This grateful breast by so unkind a question! If there is aught, that now may prove my zeal, Name it most quickly! and may glorious danger Endear the business to my eager heart! THE VICEROY. Then answer frankly one important question! SYLVEYRA. Falsehood, my lord, has never stained my lips! THE VICEROY. Say, on a soldier's faith, is it your purpose To yield Velora to her distant home? SYLVEYRA. My lord, humanity first made the promise, And honor binds me to its strict performance. THE VICEROY. Blest be thy words! their animating power Dispels my only fear! thy spirit then Has 'scaped the magic of this fair enchantress. Now, my Sylveyra, now, without disguise, I will unfold to thee my secret hopes; And thou wilt aid the wishes of thy friend. Know then, I doat upon thy lovely charge With all the fierce excess of fondest passion! Thou must engage the excellent Constantia To be my advocate:ânay! do not start! Think not, ingenuous youth, I would employ Thy virtuous parent in a task of shame, Too gross for utterance! no! my thoughts are bent On pure designs of honorable love: I mean to bind Velora to my heart By all the sanctity of marriage vows. SYLVEYRA. My lord, it is impossible. THE VICEROY. What dost thou mean? Why falters thy faint voice? Ha! tell me wherefore Across thy changing visage does there fly That sickly cloud?âBy Heaven it is the cast Of rival terror:âThou dost love Velora: Thou hast deceived me; all thy coward frame Declares the fraud, and trembles at detection. SYLVEYRA. Indeed, my lord, you're blinded by excess Of vehement passion:â'tis amazement chains My failing voice: O! what will Lisbon say? Lisbon, who loudly talks of Castro's fame! How will she credit this degrading love, That makes the noblest of her heroes, stoop From his proud height, to wed an Indian captive? How can this wondrous purpose be achieved? Is not Velora of the Bramin race, Whose laws condemn such union as a crime, Which e'en their sacred, purifying stream, The mighty Ganges, cannot wash away? THE VICEROY. And are thy fears awakened by my fame? Are they the fears of friendship, not of love? I fain would think so: if they are, perchance I may relieve thy kind concern by trusting My brightest hopes to thy congenial heart. SYLVEYRA. Your bounty has o'erwhelmed me: witness Heaven, That I esteem your happiness and glory Still dearer than my own! THE VICEROY. My dear Sylveyra, My spirit tells me, that the hand of Heaven, Whose secret agency so oft amazes The blinded eye of human apprehension, Has given this wondrous impulse to my soul, Which passes the weak power of vulgar passion, And bears the signet of divine controul. Thou know'st what wrongs this mild and gentle race Have felt for ages from the fierce Arabian; And thou hast heard what injuries they suffered From those, whose avarice abused the power Of this our great vicegerency. SYLVEYRA. Thank Heaven, The gracious tenor of your mild dominion Redeems the glory of the Christian name! THE VICEROY. Perhaps my union with the dear Velora May lead to revolutions of such wonder, As will astonish the unthinking earth: Perhaps, Sylveyra 'tis reserved for us To pass the fame of Europe's proudest boast; To pluck the crescent from this Eastern sphere, And from the Moors redeem this richer world, Too long the prey of Mahomet! SYLVEYRA. Yet how, How is it possible, my lord, to move The mighty bar of disagreeing faith, That must obstruct the marriage you design? THE VICEROY. There, my Sylveyra, thou must aid my wishes: The kind Constantia, whose engaging virtues I fully know, tho' accident has kept me A stranger to the graces of her person; She must exert those virtues to o'ercome The idle scruples of her Indian guests: Haste, and inform her, how thy friend entreats, That to their gentle minds she will display The bright advantage of so blest a union! The dear Velora shall from hence be deemed The guardian goddess of the Indian world: O haste! and swift to my impatient heart Return, with flattering presage of success. SYLVEYRA. I fain would execute your highness' pleasure; But, conversant with Brama's rigid laws I know they cannot bend to your desire: But ere I go, your highness will allow me To grant a moment to my brave associates, Who by their gallant services obtained My promise to present them to your favor. (Exit. SCENE II. THE VICEROY, (alone.) I like not the expression of his features: No warmth of zeal, no eagerness of friendship Shines in his downcast eye:âhis brow is darkened With deep distress, and jealous apprehension, That tempt me still to think, he is my rival: I must be satisfied: I will remark His looks more closely in Velora's presence: My keen observance will detect his eye In the first flashes of his treacherous love; And if I see their melting glances meetâ O! the curst image sets my brain on fire. (He walks disturbed toward the end of the stage, SCENE III. SYLVEYRA, entering with MOLINA and CARASCO. Brave friends, behold our Viceroy is alone, And waits to thank you for your gallant deeds, Of which I made to him most true report! Some secret orders, that command me hence, Allow me not a minute of delay. (Exit. SCENE IV. MOLINA, CARASCO, THE VICEROY coming forward. My resolution's fixtâI'll follow himâ Confusion! I am stoptâWhere is Sylveyra? MOLINA. My lord, this very instant he departed, With hasty zeal, on your immediate service. THE VICEROY. Insidious speed!ânew evidence of passion! 'Tis plain, 'tis fully proved: (aside.) Most brave Molina, Forgive me!âI am slow to thank thy valor! Thou hast done bravely;âLisbon shall re-echo Thy great exploits, and thence thou shalt receive The worthier thanks of a much nobler master! MOLINA. Your highness overpays my poor deserts. THE VICEROY. Wretch! while I pause, he gains the happy minutes Of festive joy to seize her melting softness, Mock my fond hopes, and triumph in his falsehood. (aside.) Your pardon! worthy friends! gallant Carasco, It grieves me, that I want the leisure now To dwell, as oft with pleasure I have done, On thy bold services; but cares of moment Perplex, and call me hence:âyet rest assured, Your merits shall not perish in my mind. SCENE V. MOLINA, CARASCO. MOLINA. Amazement! in my life I never saw His thoughts so troubled, and his steady soul So shaken from its balance. CARASCO. This is nothing: Your sapient governor, your moral Viceroy, The saint, whom you have canonized so long, Will rave, as I am told, from morn to midnight In praise of poor Sylveyra's Indian girl. MOLINA. Peace! thou art splenetic:âI know, Carasco, Thou lov'st him not: but, as I am a soldier, I do not think, our country, or the world, Has e'er produced a man more richly graced With manly virtues, valor, truth and justice. CARASCO. Curse on his justice! for it robbed me once Of the most luscious beauty, that e'er blest A soldier's fortune in the chance of war. MOLINA. Peace! peace! thy very accusation crowns him With purest praise. CARASCO. Plague on his purity! 'Tis hypocriticalâ MOLINA. Farewell, Carasco, Thou'rt in the raging fit of envious spleen, The pest of social pleasure: but if soon Thou gain'st thy more companionable humour, Thou'lt find me on the walls. (Exit. CARASCO, (alone.) If I forgive him, may I ne'er again Seize the rich plunder of submissive beauty! I know he is accustomed in disguise To take his midnight walk of observation, To pry into the manners of his people; Perhaps indulging his own secret lust. My sword is tinged with subtle Indian poison, Whose slightest touch is mortal, and by Heaven I will repay him for my wrongs, if e'er He chance to thwart me in a nightly brawl. SCENE VI. The Scene changes, and discovers VELORA, and SYLVEYRA. VELORA. It is the utmost height of human joy To meet thee thus:âto see my guardian hero Restored from danger, and with glory crowned. Blest be the God, who hearing all our vows. Watched o'er thy precious life, thro' every peril; And now, in pity to an orphan's prayers, Places once more the desolate Velora In the dear circle of thy saving arms! SYLVEYRA. Come to my heart! and live for ever there! There shalt thou reign:âit is thy own dominion: Not all the princes of the earth should tear Thy sacred form from this unshaken throne. VELORA. O! my Sylveyra, in the flood of joy My fears were drowned; too soon alas its swell Subsiding, shews the hideous form of danger. Already thou hast heard, I know thou hast, Of Castro's love, for in thy looks I read An anxious terror struggling with delight. How canst thou shield me from his base designs? SYLVEYRA. No! my Velora no! I will not wrong him: There dwells no baseness in his noble nature; His love, like all the conduct of his life, Is open, artless, manly, generous; Not thinking that the Christian light has dawned On thy unclouded soul, he has conjured me To aid his ardent wish:âTo vanquish for him Each obstacle, that Indian laws may raise, To bar his hopes of marriage with Velora. VELORA. What couldst thou answer to such cruel language? Didst thou reveal the secret of our loves? SYLVEYRA. He knows it not: amazement, grief and pity Robbed me of utterance: yes! by Heaven I pity The agonies of mind, he must endure: He loves thee with a fond excess of passion; His liberal heart would grace thy charms with all The treasures of the East; and make thy beauty The worthy partner of imperial power: And what can I? a needy child of fortune! Almost a poor dependant on his bounty! May I, Velora, from a prince seclude A precious jewel, and in secret wear it, Bound to my heart? while he would nobly give it The place, that its unrivalled lustre claims To charm the admiring world? VELORA. Canst thou suspect That pomp, that splendor, that the wealth of worlds, Could for a moment, in Velora's mind, Pretend to competition with thy love? And couldst thou, tell me, couldst thou, e'en in thought, Resign Velora to a rival's hand? SYLVEYRA. My faithful love! by thy dear self I swear, I ne'er could see thee in another's arms, And hold my reason:âmadness must ensue: Should angels call thee to their purer world, My frantic mind would murmur at its loss, Unknowing how to yield thee to my God. VELORA. Here then, thou second worship of my soul! I plight to thee my everlasting vow, To have no law, no lot, no will but thine; To be the faithful partner of thy fortunes, Thro' all the chances of this chequered world; For O! Sylveyra, death will soon dissolve Those dear, and sacred ties of filial duty, That only could divide my heart with thee. SYLVEYRA. Good angels guard thy father's closing life From every pang! and make his latest sigh Soft as an infant's slumber! dear Velora, Thou must not sink too deeply in thy sorrow; No! I will raise thee up, thou drooping flower, Beat to the earth by the injurious tempest! My love shall watch o'er thy reviving bloom, And fondly shield it from each future storm. VELORA. Alas! Sylveyra, terror joins with grief To rend my troubled heart: think of the Viceroy! Think how to ward the dangers, that may rise E'en to thy precious life, my sole protector, From all the frenzy of his fatal passion! SYLVEYRA. Fear not! my love, for Castro still is noble! He still regards me with parental kindness. In some convenient, and propitious hour I will, with gentlest arts of preparation, And candid truth, unfold to himâ VELORA. O! no! No! I conjure thee! drop that dangerous thought! Who shall defend thee in the sudden storm Of jealous fury, armed with boundless power? By all our mutual vows let me entreat thee To yield that office to Constantia's care! SYLVEYRA. Thou lovely monitor! I yield my heart To thy kind counsels. VELORA. I will fly to summon The dear Constantia to consult thy safety: Then to my father! in his close of life I feel his claims yet stronger on my heart; Farewell! SYLVEYRA. Yet stay! thou dear angelic softness! Stay yet a moment! let me kiss away This heavenly dew of filial tenderness, That glistens on the roses of thy cheek! Farewell! (Exit Velora. SCENE VII. SYLVEYRA, THE VICEROY. THE VICEROY (entering as VELORA goes out.) Distraction! death! thou treacherous boy! So young, and so accomplished in deceit! Thou viper! that I cherish in my bosom To sting me into madness! have I caught thee? Surprised thy guilty secrets, and beheld thee Staining the brilliant ruby of her lip With thy false breath? SYLVEYRA. Just, and noble Castro! Recover but the firmness of thy soul, And thou shalt own, that I have ne'er deceived thee! THE VICEROY. Oh! insolence of falsehood! not deceived me! E'en now thy base confusion proves thee false; And coward guilt denies thy faltering tongue The power to frame an artful subterfuge, To give thee e'en the varnish of a villain. SYLVEYRA. My lord! I scorn the unmanly accusation; I grieve indeed that you have seen our loves, But my pure lips have never breathed a falsehood To hide them from your sight: I will avow It was my wish to keep them still concealed: Not with a coward's treachery and fear: No! from a nobler cause, from generous pity. THE VICEROY. Thou insolent!âthy pity!âpatience, Heaven: Patience! is Castro then debased so far, To be the pity of a slave like this? What! while my generous soul was idly dreaming Of virtuous love, and purest admiration, Thou, like a secret sacrilegious thief. Hast basely robbed the shrine of sacred beauty. SYLVEYRA. My lord! my father! grant me patient hearing. THE VICEROY. Hear thee! thou traitor to that generous friendship, Which called thee forth from darkness into glory! Hear thee! for what? thou canst no longer make me The easy dupe of thy detested falsehood: And wouldst thou boast, it has been thine to riot In the rich plunder of her prostrate beauty, And teach thy willing wanton to deride Her nobler claims to a superior station? SYLVEYRA My lord! my lord! power has no privilege To sanctify the infamy of slander; And thou dost slander innocence itself, A soul as spotless, as the hand of Heaven Has e'er inshrined in woman's angel form: This purity is placed beneath my guard, And when I want the spirit to defend it, May I be branded by the public voice!â For your past bounties to my orphan youth, I spoke them many and magnificent; But thus insulted, my indignant honor Disclaims the debt, these injuries have cancelled. THE VICEROY. Thou wretch! who mak'st ingratitude thy glory, Soon shalt thou feel the power, thou hast provoked: Velora was thy prisoner, only held In just dependance on our sovereign pleasure. I shall resume a grant, so ill deserved, And made so rashly by deluded bounty. SYLVEYRA. Resume thy grant! Velora's free as air; The voice of justice, and thy own award Pronounced her free; and I will guard that freedom E'en with my life, against the uplifted arm Of majesty itself. THE VICEROY. Presumptuous upstart! What! canst thou threaten too?âby Heaven 'tis well: I thank thee: thy presumption has restored My condescending spirit to itself; It will forget its dignity no more To join in altercation with thy baseness: No! I will teach thee, false ungrateful boy! How poor, how low, how lost a thing thou art, Stript of that favor, which thy fraud abused. (Exit. SCENE VIII. SYLVEYRA (alone.) He's gone in the dark storm of jealous anger, And sullen vengeanceâmy indignant spirit O'erstepped its native bound of moderationâ But 'tis the cause of innocence and virtue! SCENE IX. SYLVEYRA, CONSTANTIA, VELORA. CONSTANTIA. Alone! my son! did we not hear this moment The voice of Castro, terrible in anger? SYLVEYRA. O! let me banish from your gentle bosoms This fond excess of fear! VELORA. My loved Sylveyra! You hide the fatal truth!âhis frantic passion Has dared to threaten, your most precious life: I know it has. SYLVEYRA. Believe me, dear Veloraâ VELORA. If this weak beauty can produce such horror, May Heaven resume its gift, and I will call Deformity a blessing! SYLVEYRA. Teach me, Heaven! To calm this cruel agony of terror! CONSTANTIA. Reflect, dear daughter, that I keep concealed A mystery of such important nature, As may preserve us in severer perils! SYLVEYRA. Name it! and save her from these killing fears! CONSTANTIA. Alas! my son, I have a tale to tell thee Of such high moment to thy peace and honor, That it requires long hours of coolest leisure To unfold it as I ought. SCENE X. SYLVEYRA, CONSTANTIA, VELORA; enter OFFICER with GUARDS. OFFICER. Gallant Sylveyra, Obedient to the Viceroy's hard command, I come, constrained, to bear thee to confinement. SYLVEYRA. Has jealousy so drowned thy sense of honor, Unhappy Castro? by my life I pity This frenzy of thy soul: Sir, I obey. VELORA. Yet stay! 'tis agony to lose thee thusâ CONSTANTIA, (to the Officer.) Thou generous servant of a cruel master, Canst thou, in pity to a mother's tears, Canst thou allow me one short hour's delay? OFFICER. Believe me, lady, on a soldier's truth, It grieves me sorely to refuse thy prayer; But if my pity granted thy request, It would be at the hazard of my life. SYLVEYRA. Sir, I attend youâministers of mercy, Descend to soothe these dear unhappy mourners VELORA. Stay! my Sylveyra, take me to thy prison! Am I not sworn thy partner to the grave? SYLVEYRA. My faithful love! O! melt not my firm soul With these fond tears! no! by our hopes I beg thee To call forth all thy latent powers, that arm Thy own great mind, and aid our dear Constantia, Absorbed in grief, and petrified with terrors. Farewell! farewell! (Exit with Officer and Guards. SCENE XI. CONSTANTIA, VELORA. VELORA. Preserve him, righteous Heaven! CONSTANTIA. Yes! I will fly, and fall before his father; That, that must save him. VELORA. Dear Constantia! speak! She hears me not:âalas! unhappy mother! There is a wildness in her looks and language, That pierces to my heart. CONSTANTIA. And yet 'tis dangerous: I know the fierceness of his cruel father. O! I am plunged again in doubt's dark sea. VELORA. Guard her, ye angels! for excess of sorrow Has robbed her tortured spirit of its reason. CONSTANTIA. No! my sweet child, I am not yet so lost: But there's a secret conflict in my soul, To which thou art a strangerâI will fly, And kneel for entrance at his prison door: For thou, my son, thou only canst decide This agonizing doubt: thy voice alone Must guide me in this crisis of our fate. SCENE XII. CONSTANTIA, VELORA, MOLINA, CARASCO. CONSTANTIA. O! good Molina lead me to my son! MOLINA. We come to calm your fears; this sudden mandate Is but a momentary start of anger; CONSTANTIA. Now I conjure thee gain me instant entrance Into Sylveyra's prison! MOLINA. Gentle friend, As yet it is impossible:âbut soonâ CONSTANTIA. Ah! talk not of delay! thou canst not know it, But I a secret must impart to him, Of power, to make e'en frantic murder pause. MOLINA. I will attend you to the citadelâ CONSTANTIA. Come, let us haste, my generous friend! and thou Noble Carasco, be Velora's guard! (Exit with Molina. SCENE XIII. VELORA, CARASCO. CARASCO. Vain is their hope: but if Velora's courage Is equal to the task, I will instruct her To baffle this base Viceroy, and preserve The injured youth, who claims her fondest care. VELORA. Then speak! and trust me, that no forms of danger Shall shake the firmness of Velora's soul. CARASCO. Blest be thy spirit, for it merits all The fond profusion of Sylveyra's love! I know your mutual hopes:ânow let my friendship Accelerate your marriage, marked by Heaven The happiness of both, and, in this crisis, Your sole protection from the crimes of Castro! VELORA. How may this be? CARASCO. By night I will secure A faithful priest, who, in disguise shall lead you Into Sylveyra's prison, and unite Your willing handsâstill from your father's weakness Conceal the secret!âTo the baffled Viceroy Let your blest lord, with joyous pride, proclaim That holy vows have made you his for ever! The foiled oppressor will no more pursue Your hallowed beauties, but renounce a treasure Thus guarded from his grasp, nor to be purchased But by the price of complicated crimes. VELORA. I yield me to thy friendly guidanceâhark! It was my father's voice: attend me to him, And still support me with thy generous counsel! CARASCO. Yet keep this project secret in thy breast, E'en from Constantia, for her fond affection Would hesitate, and tell us of thy danger! VELORA. We'll not alarm the kindness of her nature, And for myself, come danger as it may, I have no fears:âCarasco, you beheld The young Orissa perish in the bloom Of widowed beauty: you beheld her march, Fondly observant of our Indian rites, Nor moved by the dissuasive cries of friendship, Thrice round the pile, which held the hallowed corse Of her departed lord; then far within The leafy bower, whose arches crowned the pile, Take her firm seat as on a throne of glory, With dignity undaunted, while her hand Unshaken, kindled the consuming fire. CARASCO. It was a sight, that memory cannot lose. VELORA. You saw her with a smile of triumph, mock The mounting blaze, which thro' her wasted frame Shot thrilling agony, yet failed to force One plaintive sigh from her superior soul: Think of this scene, the subject of your wonder, And know Velora's willing heart would bear Those tortures twentyfold to save Sylveyra! But to my father! CARASCO. Noble, fearless girl, I worship thy warm heart; and by my sword Will freely stake my safety for thy service. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âTHE PALACE. THE VICEROY, GARCIA. THE VICEROY. Garcia no more! thy intercession's vain: Honor forbids us to recall this mandate Of just correction. GARCIA. Think on whom it falls! On one whom your fond bounty long has cherished E'en as your child: the trust of a brave friend, Who dying left you this rich legacy, This sacred pledge of confidence and honor Still to be worn with pride upon the heart. THE VICEROY. Away! for all you plead in his defence Turns to the aggravation of his guilt, And sanctifies my sentence. GARCIA. Think, my lord, This is no trifling business! it demands Most deep discussion; for on this award Hangs all the glory of your life to come, Nay all your honors past; if these are dear, You must revoke this wrong, unguarded sentence: You must, by Heaven, you must. THE VICEROY. Garcia, beware! Relying on our ancient amity, Thou dost presume too far upon my patience. GARCIA. Let fawning flattery be struck dumb with fear, When her proud idol frowns! 'tis friendship's glory. In spite of quick resentment's random fire, To persevere in her most noble duty, And counter-work the mines of treacherous passion. THE VICEROY. And thou art come, most sapient monitor, To teach us wisdom, honesty and virtue. GARCIA. Yes! I will hold a faithful mirror to thee, And shew thy troubled mind its own distortion; Will hold it, tho' insulted with thy scorn, E'en till that mind resume its native features, And thank me for the service. Noble friend, I know, thou dost believe thy sentence just: But dive into thy heart, and thou wilt find Velora's beauty, is Sylveyra's guilt. THE VICEROY. Leave us, presumptuous counsellor! thou canst not Make firm authority revoke his mandate By the vain preaching of thy pedant pride. GARCIA. No! Castro, no! I cannot, dare not yield thee To the dominion of this tyrant passion, Which mayâ THE VICEROY. O! patience Heaven! shall I for ever Be rated thus by insolent dependants? GARCIA. Unhappy Castro! like a drowning wretch, In a blind struggle, thou dost beat away The very arm extended for thy safety; Yes! I will leave thee on thy proud dismission; May mightier visitation from above Irradiate thy dark mind! may Isabel, That blessed saint, that martyr of thy love, Descend to watch o'er thy disordered spirit! And dispossess thee of this jealous fiend, Ere his blind fury gain increasing force, And hurry thee to deeds of deepest horror! Farewell! great injured mind, farewell! THE VICEROY. Yet stay! My Garcia, stay!âthou hast pronounced a name, Whose very sound's a sacred charm, of power To melt the obdurate pride of fiercest anger. Oh Isabel! thy wrongs are all revenged, In the wild horrors of this troubled heart: Garcia, I think, I know, thou art my friend; But there's a rigor in thy steady soul, That will not give thee even power to guess The agonies of weaker minds:âby Heaven I hate my own infirmity of nature; And by my life I am ashamed to tell thee, How this fierce love has preyed upon my soul, Absorbing every faculty. GARCIA, (aside.) Now, friendship, Aid me to make e'en passion's self the means To work his preservation! THE VICEROY. This sweet Indian Haunts my wild fancy still:âin every change Of day, of night, of place, of occupationâ I see her in the vacancies of air: I hear her magic voice in midnight silence: And find the spirit of my life consumed In this encreasing flame of fierce desire. GARCIA. Now Castro! I perceive a glimpse of hope, That thy fond wish may yet succeed. THE VICEROY. Say how! Dear Garcia, say! O give me all thy meaning! GARCIA. Release Sylveyra!âshew the soft Velora You scorn the advantage of tyrannic power, And with a generous rivalship submit To court her kindness! THE VICEROY. I approve thy counsel: 'Tis just, 'tis manly, 'tis like Garcia's soul Untainted with a shadow of dishonor: Yes! thou shall see this frail, this feverish heart Still not unworthy of a friend like thee. Come! follow me! we'll hasten to Sylveyra, Declare him free, and let him know how deeply We both are debtors to thy signal virtue. AN ATTENDANT, (entering.) My lord, this paper will explain my office, And plead my pardon, while I beg your highness To grant me private audience. THE VICEROY, to GARCIA. Wait, my friend, In my apartment! I will join thee there! (Exit Garcia. SCENE II. THE VICEROY, and ATTENDANT. THE VICEROY, (examining the letter.) Confusion! bound by secret, solemn oaths To marry them in prison, and to-night! Treacherous Velora! death! what in the moment, When my fond soul with a forgiving franknessâ ATTENDANT. My lord! the holy friar has enjoin'd me To say, his life depends upon your silence. THE VICEROY. Go! let him banish fear! tell the good monk His services are treasured in my heart. (Exit Attendant. SCENE III. THE VICEROY, (alone.) To-night appointed for your treacherous union! Never shall night that consummation see. These hours are mine, nor will I lose themâhence Ye dainty scruples, of deluded honor! Ye made me pause too long.âLove, manly love, Nature's strong heir, not custom's puny child, Points my fair prey, and like the hunter's cry Leads my keen spirit to the chase of joy. (Exit. SCENE IV. PERSOD discovered sleeping on a couch, and VELORA sitting by him. VELORA. Ye ministers of peace, O! kindly visit His troubled slumbers! let not frightened nature Thus lose the balmy influence of rest. PERSOD, (still sleeping.) Beware my child bewareâthis cruel Viceroy! VELORA. Unhappy father! how it grieves my soul To see thee shaken by these painful terrors. PERSOD. No! tyrant, no! away! away! thou shalt not Tear her from these weak armsâI clasp her still. (waking.) Good Heaven! where am I? O my child! my child! Do I indeed embrace thee still, my daughter? Is there no ruffian near? VELORA. Be not alarmed, My gentle father!â'twas a vision only; Here is no being but thy own Velora. PERSOD. Alas! my child, these terrifying phantoms Tear my weak frame:âthey shake me still with horror, Methought I saw thee in the savage grasp Of the fierce Viceroy:âhence distracting image! It haunts me still. VELORA. Let thy beloved Velora Calm these wild fears, and talk them into peace! PERSOD. Still! my sweet child, assure my trembling heart, That when thy old weak guard is severed from thee, As soon he must be, strong in native virtue, Thou wilt resist the Viceroy's cruel aims, That no rich offers of insidious love, No terrors of the tyrant, shall betray Thy yielding beauty to his impious arms! VELORA. No! by thy tender love, thy hallowed age, By all the virtues of thy heart, I swear No powers shall force me to that shameful fate. PERSOD. Thanks! my dear child, thy animating words Breathe thro' my chilly breast a cheering glow, And warm me with new lifeâmethinks I gain A new supply of strength; and I will use it To taste the freshness of the evening air. Bless thee, my kind attendant. VELORA. Still let my arm Assist your steps! PERSOD. No! sweet support, I thank thee, I will but venture to yon shady palm, To soothe my troubled thoughts, and recollect The thousand tender things, paternal love Has yet to utter, ere our last adieu: Remain thou here! and I will soon return. (Exit. SCENE V. VELORA, (alone.) Spare, gracious Heaven! the weakness of his age From farther misery! whatever ills Thy dreadful pleasure may design to pour Upon our hapless race, O! keep them all For my devoted head! nor more afflict This mild, indulgent, helpless, fond old man! Good Heaven! what voice!âit is our evil genius: It is the Viceroyâ SCENE VI. THE VICEROY, VELORA. THE VICEROY, (entering) Guards attend without. Thanks be to love: I hold thee once again, Bewitching beauty! and I know thee now: Yes! under this soft veil of artless youth Lies all the finished artifice of woman: Thou canst forget thy Indian laws, and yield This sacred treasure to an alien's arms: With a refining spirit of delight, Thou canst convert a dungeon to a scene Of midnight bliss. VELORA, (aside.) Our purpose is betrayed! THE VICEROY. Yet have thy charms the fascinating power To melt the fiercest wrath; I will forget The cruel pangs thy treachery inspires, If cancelling the offence, thou yet wilt grant me, The dear rich recompense, for which my soul So keenly pants with agony of passion. VELORA. Never! never! THE VICEROY. Perverse, fantastic girl! Canst thou still doat upon an abject slave, When royalty's extended arms would press Thy beauty into rapture? VELORA. Yes! proud tyrant, This constant heart will idolize for ever That hero, whom thy crimes have made a prisoner: Velora's firm and faithful soul, would rather Embrace his bondage, than partake thy power, E'en had thy pride the privilege of Heaven To make its reign immortal. THE VICEROY. Rash Velora! Thou dost provoke my wild insulted love To sieze this golden minute, and repay My tortured senses with a sweet revenge. Come! thou shalt bless me. VELORA. Help! O! help me Heaven! SCENE VII. THE VICEROY, VELORA; PERSOD, (entering and throwing himself before the Viceroy.) Turn! thou base tyrant! hear a father's voice! Behold his weakness prostrate at thy feet! Release! release my child! nor by this outrage Wound sacred nature in a parent's soul! THE VICEROY. Distracting interruption! By my life His reverend form, and his white hairs have struck Blank awe thro' all my veinsâ My trembling sinews have not power to take her From his weak holdâand yet by Heaven she must not Compleat the triumph of her treacherous love. Guards there without! Enter GUARDS. PERSOD. O mercy! mighty Castro, Thou wilt not force my innocent child away, While these paternal arms are stretched to save her. THE VICEROY, to the Guards. Reasons of state compel me to divide These faithless captives: Soldiers! on your duty I charge ye, part them with the gentlest violence, And lead Velora to the western tower! (Exit. SCENE VIII. VELORA, PERSOD, GUARDS. VELORA. Most cruel mandate! most inhuman Castro! PERSOD. No! ye vile slaves ye shall not tear her from me: No! I will hang upon her darling form, E'en 'till my heart strings break. SOLDIER. Old man, forbear Thy sorrows grieve usâbut we must obeyâ PERSOD. Curse my weak age! VELORA. My father! O! my father! SCENE IX. As the Guards force off VELORA, CONSTANTIA enters with an Attendant, speaking as she enters. Mercy! they sieze! they tear Velora from usâ Unhappy father! whence this horrid outrage? PERSOD. Now, mighty Sieb! great avenging spirit! Now, now exert thy power! it is thy servant; It is a father calls, a father robbed, Most basely robbed, in his enfeebled age, Of his dear daughter, of his darling child. Blast this fell ravisher!âwith lightning's speed Let death's fierce summons seize his haggard soul! And if he has a child, O! make him feel What torturesâmercy heaven! I faintâ (He falls. CONSTANTIA. O! save him! Alas his feeble strings of life are broken By this inhuman violence.âHe breathesâ Now bear him gently hence!âin pity's name Watch him with tenderest care till my return; For I must hasten to preserve his child! (they bear off Persod. Now, Castro it is time thou shouldst behold Thy Isabel yet lives; for thou art tost On a tempestuous flood, and little know'st What hidden rocks of horror thou art near: My voice must point them to thy blinded spirit, Ere thy wild passions plunge us in a gulf Of deepest ruin, misery, and guilt.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âTHE WESTERN TOWER. VELORA, PANEEA. VELORA. Faithful Paneea! thy afflictive tidings Have pierced my heart: alas! unhappy father. Robbed of thy child, whose fondness should have watched Thy parting spirit in its latest struggle, And closed those eyes, that never, never cast A look upon me, but of tenderest love! PANEEA. My gentle mistress, yield not to thy grief. Think it was happy for his helpless age To lay the burden of its misery down; VELORA. Yet have I reason for severest sorrow: The wretched daughter, bound by dearest duty To smooth the bed of death, there planted thorns To pierce her dying fatherâ'twas my zeal To save Sylveyra's life; it was thy child, Thou injured parent, whose misguided aim So blindly sharpened thy expiring pangs. O! were they not most terrible to look on? PANEEA. Let not such visionary fears alarm Your troubled heart! in a short agony Your injured father begged of Heaven to blast The Viceroy's base designs: opprest he fainted; But soon recovering, with more tranquil thought Commended to his God your innocence; Then death, as if in pity of his woes, Approaching in the form of softest slumber Released his spirit from this tainted sphere, To gain the happier heights of purer being. VELORA. My good Paneea, thou dost vainly try To soothe my anguish; e'en the happier child, Who, blest with peace, yields, in her native land An aged parent to the hand of Heaven, By nature's dictates sheds the frequent tear Of unrestrained affliction: what must I, A captive orphan, robbed of that fond father, Whose love, whose virtues were my kind support? PANEEA. May lenient time relieve thy wounded bosom! VELORA. Long will my filial heart lament his loss, And conscious of its treasure torn away, Ache at this cruel void.âBut go, I pray thee, Prepare the hallowed bale-tree to receive His dear remains, and let thy faithful hand Pour richest incense on the blazing pile, Since bondage keeps me from that sacred duty! PANEEA. I will obey thee, dear, and gentle mistress, Farewell! and all pure spirits be thy guard. (Exit. SCENE II. VELORA, (alone.) O! my Sylveyra, thou alone on earth Art now the guardian of forlorn Velora; And thou art doomed to bonds: perchance to fall In the dark dungeon by the secret stab Of base assassination: what is left For me, disconsolate and wretched captive, But in this solitude to sit and weep My unexampled wrongs, and fatal love? SCENE III. While VELORA remains in a pensive attitude, THE VICEROY enters unperceived. THE VICEROY. She sees me not, absorbed in pensive sorrow; Anxiety is painted in her eye; And fear sits panting on her lovely bosom, Like agitation on the aspin leaf Trembling at every breeze: I dare not speakâ How may I find a favorable minute To soothe her angry grief, and melt its rage To pity and forgiveness? VELORA, (starting up.) Mercy, Heaven! Thou base assassin! has thy soul the power To look on the sad orphan, thou hast made? Dar'st thou approach me? can thy heart so soon Insult the sanctity of filial sorrow? THE VICEROY. Hear me, thou injured fair! by Heaven I vow My heart is guiltless of thy father's death! I would not have deprived his honored age Of one short hour, one moment of existence, To make my days immortal. Could my blood Redeem his life, and give him to thy prayers, I now would pour it freely at thy feet. VELORA. Vain penitence! did not thy cruel hand Tear from his bleeding heart his darling child? THE VICEROY. 'Twas the wild fear of seeing thee enrich A rival's arms, 'twas that distracting image, That drove my maddening soul to cruel force, Unconscious of the horrors, that have followed: I feel them nowâjoined to thy just reproach, They make me execrate my own existence. Thou injured orphan! in this wretched bosom Plunge thy avenging dagger! it will end Variety of pangs, more keen than all, My fatal passion has e'er heaped on theeâ Remorse and anguish harrow up my mind; Yet, while I gaze upon thee, fiercer love Burns in my frantic heart: all milder thoughts, Which penitence and pity can suggest, He drowns; and leaves triumphant in my soul The mighty madness of his raging fire. VELORA. Canst thou pretend to sorrow, to remorse, And still insult me with licentious passion In this afflictive hour? THE VICEROY. O! my Velora, There is a tempest in my soul, that robs My tongue of language, and my thoughts of reason; But 'tis excess, 'tis agony of love, Which claims thy pardon, which deserves thy pity. GARCIA, (behind the scenes.) Where is the Viceroy?âslave!âhe must be found, And I will pass theeâ THE VICEROY. Ha! whose fury dares Insult our guard? SCENE IV. THE VICEROY, VELORA; GARCIA enters with an Officer. THE VICEROY. O! Garcia, what inspires This bold contempt? GARCIA. Thy danger, with a sense Of honor, and attachment still remaining To one, who little has deserved my friendship; Whose fatal passions have at length produced The dire effects proportioned to their guiltâ But 'tis no time to parley; thro' the city All is confusion, anger, and revenge: The swarming Indians, with religious fury, Call on their murdered Bramin: all our troops, With spirits ripe for mutiny, demand Sylveyra's freedom. O! unhappy Castro, If justice, glory, and our country's welfare Are names yet dear to thee, appear! come forth! Haste! re-assume thy better self, and rush To quell these tumults, ere they rise to crush thee. THE VICEROY. By hell's dark powers the tidings, thou hast brought, Suit the wild tempest in my tortured brain: Lead to the fiercest terrors of the storm! I'll gladly meet them; for my soul's prepared To rush upon the lightning's keenest flash, And bless the thunders, that are launched against me. GARCIA. Come! my brave friend, let me but soothe thy spirit, And lead thy virtue to a just atonement, We yet may stop the ruin, that impends. THE VICEROY turning back, as he and GARCIA are quitting the stage. But my Velora!âmark me Officer! Let her be treated with most humble duty! Nor be her steps confined, except within The utmost limits of our castle wall! But place a double guard at every gate! Farewell! thou matchless, dear, destructive beauty! (Exit with Garcia. VELORA. (alone. Ye generous men! who strive to terminate The base enthralment of our dear Sylveyra, Still may the sense of all his bright perfections, His great achievements, and his galling wrongs Feed the just anger of your noble minds! SCENE V. VELORA, CARASCO. CARSACO, (entering hastily.) Come dear Velora, I at length have gained The moment for thy freedom; haste we now To seize it, while this din of arms engages The watchful goaler of thy captive beauty! VELORA. Away! away! thy fatal schemes have plunged My soul in anguish, and destroyed my fatherâ CARASCO. Oh! blame me not! it was the treacherous priestâ Curse on his abject, avaricious soul! Whose sordid hopes betrayed us to the Viceroy: But let us lose all thought of evils past In haste to seize this golden, glorious minute, That calls thee now from bondage: I have bribed Sylveyra's guard; will lead you to his prison, And shew ye both a subterraneous door: By this we gain the City; sure protection Awaits us there: Sylveyra's ready friends Will rise in arms, the moment they behold him. VELORA. Thou generous friend! I will embrace thy kindness, And bless thee for it: lead me to my lord! To save Sylveyra's precious life is now My only hope, my only end of being. CARASCO. Come on! my lovely ward! now, Castro, mourn Thy baffled fondness! I have foiled thee now; And my past wrongs are happily repaid, While with triumphant joy, I bear away This beauteous treasure from thy tyrant grasp. (Exeunt. SCENE VI. GUARDS, (behind the scene.) You must not pass us; 'tis the Viceroy's order. CONSTANTIA, (behind the scene.) Ye cruel guards! ye shall not force me back: Affliction has a sacred claim to enter The residence of power. Entering with an Officer. Thanks! gallant soldier! Who hast compassion for a woman's woes! Now guide me to the Viceroy! OFFICER. Lovely mourner Believe me, he is absent from the castle! CONSTANTIA. Then by thy duty, wheresoe'er he is, Conduct me to him! I have things to utter Of higher moment than his life itself. OFFICER. Necessity constrains me to refuse Thy eager prayer: the Viceroy is engaged In scenes of tumult, which thy tender frame Would tremble to encounter. CONSTANTIA. Prove my spirit! I have a heart, that in the embattled field Would cross the thunder of the bursting cannon To reach the Viceroy: I conjure thee guide me! I have an awful mystery to tell, That yet may save him from impending crimes. OFFICER. Thy words amaze me, and enforce my service. CONSTANTIA. Lead on! and fear not! for the saints of Heaven Will clear our way, and with their sacred power Assist the parent to preserve her child. (Exeunt. SCENE VII. âTHE CITY. A TUMULT OF INDIANS. FIRST INDIAN. Revenge! revenge, for Brama's sacred blood! For age and wisdom, murdered by the hand Of impious tyranny! SECOND INDIAN. Let's to the castle! And from that den of sacrilegious lust Drag this proud Viceroy, while his angry guards Yield him our easy prey. SCENE VIII. THE VICEROY, GARCIA and INDIANS. THE VICEROY. Spare your vain search, Ye madding croud! behold that Viceroy here, Whose power ye question, and whose blood ye thirst for! Ungrateful people! can ye thus forget From what dark depths of ruinous abasement I raised your plundered race? there was a time, When cruel rapine, with unbridled rage, Preyed on your wasted wealth; when every voice, That rose from India to unpitying Heaven, Poured wild complaint, and bitter execration, Against the insatiate sons of sordid Europe: Those scenes of wretchedness our cares have changed To the mild blessings of protected commerce, And equal justice; yet your mutinous spirits Insult the power, that saves you from perdition. GARCIA. Behold, my lord, how their misguided fury, With just contrition, sinks to silent shame! AN AGED INDIAN. Hear! mighty Castro, hear the suppliant voice Of age! forgive, and soothe thy troubled people! They own thy mild dominion; they revere Thy princely virtues: yet in wildest terror Dread, lest insidious passion should betray thee To trample on those laws, in whose defence Thy steady virtue has so long upheld The sword of justice, and the shield of mercy. O! be their guardian still! in generous pity Give, to the humblest prayers of duty, give The captive child of that unhappy Bramin, Whose terrors for his daughter torn away, Piercing his soul, abridged his virtuous days! THE VICEROY. Thou good old man! thy mildness has more power To move the heart of Castro, than the threats Of fiercest war, when, in his wildest fury, His loud voice sounds defiance and destruction. My troubled subjects! just and gentle spirits! I have obtained an empire in your hearts; 'Twas my ambition:â'tis my noblest pride; Nor shall base passions tempt me now to forfeit This best dominion: let the coward tyrant Enshroud in falsehood's veil his crimes, his fears! My heart shall own its errors, and retrieve them. INDIAN. Ye sons of India, hear your gracious lord! He has no thought of impious violation. THE VICEROY. My fatal passionâI retain it stillâ But deeply conscious, this afflictive love, This cruel source of horrors unforeseen, Must wound your dearest rights: those hallowed laws Which I am bound to cherish, not invade, Know that my soul has vowed to see no more That lovely maid! whose fascinating charms Tempt justice from its throne: ye now have heard Our serious purpose; to confirm it farther To you, my people! that unshaken honor May be the guard of feebler continence, I give this sacred pledge, your Sovereign's truth: If now ye think us worthy of your trust, Dismiss your every fear, disperse, and leave us! INDIANS. May Heaven long guard the just, the generous Castro! He may command our treasures, and our blood. THE VICEROY and GARCIA come forward, and the Scene closes behind them. SCENE IX. THE VICEROY, GARCIA. GARCIA. Blest be thy virtues! I regain my friend: My heart could almost worship thee for this, For well I know how dearly it has cost Thy feeling soul; but honor shall repay thee, And fame immortal be thy rich reward. THE VICEROY. Garcia my word is past: I mean to keep itâ My heart was formed to merit, and engage The blessings of my people, not their curse: But thou must be my feeble virtue's guard; For should I look on that enchanting form, The very firmest of these bright resolves Would prove a lucid bubble, lost in air The moment it is blown. GARCIA. Release your captives, And time will make thro' every hour of life This best of triumphs dearer to your heart! THE VICEROY. Go thou, dear Garcia, to the western tower! I will not hazard e'en the slightest chance To meet the eyes of that bewitching beauty: Go, send her to Constantia! then my friend Haste to rejoin me in Sylveyra's prison! He is again the child of my adoption; It shall be now my constant aim to banish All trace of passion, and the name of rival. GARCIA. Blest be thy words! they give my age new life; And I shall meet thee with the speed of youth. (Exeunt. SCENE X. âA PRISON. CARASCO, entering with VELORA. Curse on that busy and officious fool, Who thus detained our steps!âwe've lost an age: Sylveyra should be here: what ho! my friend! VELORA. Good Heaven! he hears us notâthey have destroyed him. SYLVEYRA, (entering.) It was an angel, or Velora's voice: What joy! 'tis she herselfâmy life! my love! What blessed chanceâ CARASCO. We have no time for words; Each moment's of inestimable price: I come to save ye both!âfollow my steps, And I will guide ye thro' a path unknown! SYLVEYRA. My true Carasco! faithful, generous friend! Watch o'er this dearer portion of my life, And haste to guide my loved Velora hence! But for myself, a Soldier's tender fame Forbids this secret flight: it wears too much The cast of conscious guilt, and coward fear. CARASCO. These ill-timed scruples of mistaken honor Are ruin to our hopesâ VELORA. My own Sylveyra, Thou seest Velora fatherless before thee, Enabled only to sustain her being By her fond hopes in thy protecting love; Thou art her sole supporter, can thy heart Desert so dear a duty, to obey The fancied dictates of delusive honor? SYLVEYRA. Never! no never! all this heart is thine: The tender accents of thy plaintive voice Wake every fond emotion in my soul, And teach me 'tis the glory of my life To guard thy innocence thro' every perilâ Away! I will attend you:âyet my friend A moment's pause! to shield us from pursuit I'll bar yon avenueâdo thou, Carasco, Watch at the other grate, lest any noise Awake suspicion in the court below! CARASCO. Be swiftâdelay's inevitable deathâ SYLVEYRA, withdraws at the end of the stage, and CARASCO remains attentive on the opposite side. VELORA. How slow, how awful are these trying minutes Of doubtful fate, that on their shadowy wings In dread concealment bear the uncertain form Of safety or perdition? Hear me Heaven!â SCENE XI. SYLVEYRA, and CARASCO on opposite sides of the stage, while VELORA is absorbed in devotion. THE VICEROY, (entering.) This resolution ne'er to see her more Is medicine to my mindâha! what art thou, Bewitching form? art thou a mere illusion, Or the fair sorceress herself, whose power Seeks my perdition? let me clasp, and prove thee! Thou dear delicious poison! O! thy touch Drives hot delirium thro' my every vein. VELORA. Help me! Carasco, help! CARASCO. Turn, tyrant! turn Base ravisher! and meet thy punishment! THE VICEROY. Audacious villain! it is mine to punish; And thus I prove my power. They fight. CARASCO. I spurn it thusâ Thank my kind stars I touch theeâ'tis enough. THE VICEROY. Vile traitor! I despise thy nerveless arm, And thus repay thy feeble wound with death. (While they are engaged VELORA flies.) CARASCO. Curse thy strong arm! it hasâit has destroyed me. SYLVEYRA, (rushing towards them.) I am too late! he falls! unhappy friend! SCENE XII. THE VICEROY, SYLVEYRA, CARASCO, GARCIA, and GUARDS. In the moment CARASCO is falling, GARCIA enters with GUARDS, and seizes the sword of SYLVEYRA. GARCIA. What treachery is here? Castro, thou'rt wounded! THE VICEROY. My hurt is trifling: I have killed this traitor: Guards bear Sylveyra to more close confinement! SYLVEYRA. Off! I will take a soldier's last farewell Of this brave man, who dying thus pours forth His generous blood in friendship's fatal cause. THE VICEROY. Away! they shall not interchange a wordâ GUARDS force off SYLVEYRA. CARASCO. Insulting tyrant! thou mayst triumph now, Thy triumph will be short.âIt joys me yet To see the lion circled in my toils, Unconscious of his danger.âSudden fate, Invisible to thee, hangs o'er thy head: This prospect of revenge, enough for me, Gilds all the horrors of impending death, E'en in these moments, while I feel his hand Pressing most heavyâO! my life is pastâ But thine, thine cannot last beyondâO Heaven! (Dies. GARCIA. What mean these vile mysterious threats? I fear Some dark, and deep conspiracy is formed By those, who murmured at Sylveyra's fate: My honored friend! haste! to thy bleeding wound Get timely succour! while I search if aught Of secret treason lurk within the walls. THE VICEROY. No, my kind Garcia, I will first go forth, And make provision for the public safety. Come then, my generous friend, dismiss thy fears! Luxuriant case, and beauty are alone The bane of Castro: in the hour of danger Thy piercing eye shall never find his soul False to the hopes of animated friendship, And idly distant from the goal of honor.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âBEFORE THE CASTLE GATE. CONSTANTIA, and a SENTINEL. SENTINEL. Hast thou not heard, thou canst not be admitted? Then trouble us no more with fruitless clamour! CONSTANTIA. Unfeeling slave!âO! I am faint to death: Yet hear me! yet admit me to the Viceroy! And wretched as I seem, most rich reward Shall make thee bless thy pity. SENTINEL. I have told thee, I dare not on my life, the Viceroy's wounded Even to death; and none must pass our gate Without immediate order from the council. CONSTANTIA. Good Heaven! my Castro in the pangs of death! Slave! I will pass. SENTINEL. Presumptuous woman! hence! Or wait without, and wholesome solitude Shall teach thee to be patient. (Enters and shuts the Gate. SCENE II. CONSTANTIA, (alone.) O! my husband! My dying Castro! could thy closing eyes Behold thy Isabel, that once loved name, Thus by a scornful slave, forbid to pour Her fond forgiveness on thy parting soul! Mercy! what means this image of distraction? 'Tis my Velora, whose disordered features Too strongly speak her frantic agony Of terror and surprise. SCENE III. CONSTANTIA, VELORA. VELORA, (entering hastily) Now save thy son! If pitying Heaven yet give thee time to save him! CONSTANTIA. Haste! guide me to him! tell me what the danger! Where is Sylveyra? what must I attempt? VELORA. Alas! I know not; all is doubt and horror: I left the tyrant in Sylveyra's prison Fiercely encountering the brave Carasco; And may that faithful friend with noble vengeance Repay our various wrongs. CONSTANTIA. Where was Sylveyra? Was his arm raised against the life of Castro? Can it be possible that Heaven permitted So horrible a conflict! can my son, Have drowned his honors in a father's blood! SCENE IV. CONSTANTIA, VELORA, MOLINA. MOLINA, (entering hastily.) Away! my gentle friends, and let me guide ye To some securer refuge, at these gates Dire scenes of fierce contention may ensue! CONSTANTIA. Explain thy friendly fears! MOLINA. Carasco's slain, But in base conflict, with a poisoned sword Has wounded Castro: our unhappy Viceroy, In keenest torture, hardly now sustains A life expected every hour to close. CONSTANTIA. Mercy! I charge thee to that bed of death Conduct my steps!âa sacred duty calls meâ MOLINA. That cannot be: I am myself commanded To quit the castle; all Sylveyra's friends Are kept aloof with a suspicious fear: Alas! unhappy parent! I must tell thee Tidings yet more afflictive: at this moment The council, jealous of endangered power, And eager to revenge the Viceroy's fate Is met to search, how far Sylveyra's wrongs Made him the accomplice of this dark assassin: But we acquainted with his noble natureâ VELORA. Shame on the base ingratitude, that wounds His spotless virtue with its vile suspicion! CONSTANTIA. O horror! horror! this unhappy father Will in the blind, convulsive pangs of death Assassinate his child! and call it justice: Thou good Molina! think not that affliction Has driven all sense from this disordered brain, While I inform thee, that in me thou seest The wife, the innocent, the injured wife Of thy deluded, dear, expiring master, Who thinks his poor deserted Isabel Now mould'ring in her grave, nor yet suspects That brave Sylveyra is the son he lost. VELORA. The son of Castro! thou his injured wife! MOLINA. Amazement! art thou that lamented victim Of cruel jealousy? CONSTANTIA. Stay not to question My wondrous fate! a moment's pause is worse Than death's worst pang: it may destroy a life Far dearer than my own: my slandered son! Fly! fly to save him! MOLINA. Would I had heard This tale, before the terrors of the council Shut me from out these walls!â'tis now too late. VELORA. Too late! O mercy has their coward fear Condemned his virtue? has the cruel Viceroy Forced themâ CONSTANTIA. Distraction! he has killed his child! I see the father stained with filial blood! O unexampled crime! MOLINA. Maternal love, Too keenly sensible, destroys thy reason: But calm its frantic fearsâthy son yet lives: Yet interposing Heavenâ CONSTANTIA. May I believe thee? Save me from madness! swear they have not killed him! MOLINA. Be comforted, fond parent! by my life He livesâyet friendship trembles at his danger: The timid council, who well know thy son The army's idol, jealous and alarmed, By every caution to prevent his rescue, Exclude us from the castle; if we plead Thy story for admission, they will call it A sudden artifice to save thy sonâ CONSTANTIA. O! for a voice of thunder to proclaim The sacred truth! but let us force our passage Thro' these inhuman guards! what can they more Than wound this wretched frame? and let them bathe Their sabres in my blood, if they but leave My mangled limbs the power to crawl towards him, Shrieks of maternal terror shall detain The parting soul of this unconscious father, And bid him save his unoffending child. MOLINA. One chance remains:âto sue for entrance here Would be to waste inestimable minutes; But at the gate, by which I left the castle, Some sentinels are placed, much bound to me By various services; perchance their spirit Will bravely venture on this breach of orders: Haste we to prove it! VELORA. Come! our suppliant tears Shall melt the sternestâ CONSTANTIA. Now, relenting Heaven! Now shew thy mercy to an injured mother! (Exeunt. SCENE V. GARCIA, with a Council of OFFICERS. FIRST OFFICER. My valiant friends! the blazing sun is set. Whose vital energy gave life and splendor To Lusitanian glory:âmighty Castro, With pain exhausted, sinks in heavy slumber, That much, 'tis feared, must terminate in death: Our grief and duty to as brave a leader As ever soldier followed to the field, The voice of justice, and the public safety, All loudly call for signal, speedy vengeance On the surviving traitor, deeply joined In guilty compact with the base Carasco. GARCIA. Behold the victim you demand! SCENE VI. GARCIA and COUNCIL; SYLVEYRA, (guarded.) GARCIA. My duty To our lamented chief, my murdered friend, Bids me pronounce a painful accusation: That done, I leave it to the council's wisdom To judge his answer, and decide his fate. Unhappy youth! it is with grief I charge thee With having stained thy honors, nobly won, By dark conspiracy, by meanly joining In basest vengeance with a vile assassin. SYLVEYRA. O! Garcia, wrong not by so base a name A gallant, generous, and departed soldier, Lavish of life in friendship's sacred cause! Would I alone had met the oppressive arm Of this proud ravisher! what! tho' I owed him Obedience as a subject! nobler duties More loudly called me as a man to guard That injured innocence, and plaintive beauty, Which his fierce rage had seized for violation. GARCIA. Thou lost young man! whose fairer dawn of life Gave the false promise of progressive virtue, I quit the little hope, my heart had formed To find thee guiltless, while I hear thee thus, With the bold insolence of vice, defend The villain, who destroyed his sovereign's life By the base wound of an envenomed sword. SYLVEYRA. By an envenomed sword! can this be true? GARCIA. The dying ruffian, with mysterious triumph, Joyed in his crime. SYLVEYRA. Could friendship be the mask Of blackest vengeance? GARCIA. When I seized thy sword In the confusion of that fatal conflict It seemed, in aid of the accurst assassin, To point its murd'rous aim at Castro's heart. SYLVEYRA. Think not an abject love of life can lead me To clear my innocence!âI know too well The tyrant's jealousy, which e'en in death Will rage, to rob me of the only treasure, That makes life lovely in Sylveyra's eyes. But just attention to my wounded honor Bids me proclaim, my sword was only drawn To interrupt their conflict. GARCIA. Couldst thou prove That generous purpose, thy untainted honor Would, with the force of the meridian beam, Start from this passing cloud: but, hapless youth! The only witness that perchance might clear Thy sullied fame, is that departing hero, Whose pale lips, now we strongly fear, have closed To speak no more; and for myself, I grieve, While painful truth impels me to repeat, That if my eye deceived me not, thy sword Was basely levelled at his sacred life. FIRST OFFICER. Now Garcia, thou has paid thy debt to friendship; Our duty points to justice.â A MESSENGER, (entering.) Suspend your resolution, valiant chiefs! It is the Viceroy's will:âhe haply gains Some little portion of reviving strength, And has commanded his attendant train To bear him to the council, that his sentenceâ But see! his mighty mind, tho' worn with torture, Anticipates my messageâ SCENE VII. GARCIA and COUNCIL, SYLVEYRA, THE VICEROY. THE VICEROY, (brought in.) Gently! friends, All motion throws a sickly langour e'er me, And robs my spirit of collected thoughtâ Dear Garcia, I am faintâwhene'er I die, Thou art my successor: I would not wish To place dominion in a nobler hand. GARCIA. That faithful hand shall resolutely guide The sword of justice to avengeâ THE VICEROY. Ah! no! I charge thee no! I heard thy dangerous error; Thou hast believed the innocent Sylveyra The accomplice of a ruffian: but I come, With pain collecting all the shattered powers Of my dissolving frame, to prove his truth; To witness, that his generous arm was raised Not to destroy, but guard the ungrateful master, Who basely wronged him. GARCIA. Blest be thy firm soul, Thou dear lamented friend, which timely clears My dread mistake, and saves blind zeal from staining The sword of eager justice, with the blood Of slandered virtue. THE VICEROY. Gallant, injured youth! Come near me! for the friendly hand of death Has rent asunder that dark veil of passion, Which hid thy virtues from my blinded heart! Give me thy hand? before my fatal frenzy I loved thee as my son: 'twas I who first Broke that dear bond. SYLVEYRA. Thou kind, exalted spirit! Still mayst thou live, and be again my father! THE VICEROY. No! generous youth! my feverish dream of life Is hastening to its close: but O! my friends, Be it related to our royal master, That Castro owned, with his expiring lips, How deeply he had wronged the brave Sylveyra; And dying, begged, it might be told his king, That in his service he will never find A valiant youth of fairer expectation. SYLVEYRA. O unexampled nobleness of nature! It rends my heart:âO! that my worthless lifeâ SCENE VIII. THE VICEROY, GARCIA, SYLVEYRA, CONSTANTIA, &amp;c. CONSTANTIA, (throwing herself before the Viceroy.) Save him! O save him, Castro! 'tis thy son! The son of Isabel! thy injured wife! Behold her proud heart prostrate at thy feet! THE VICEROY. Good Heaven! thy piercing accents have convulsed All my weak springs of lifeâlook up! O shew me Thy features, thou! that hast assumed a name, Whose very sound is torture to my soul! Thou blessed form! my Isabel herself! My innocent, my living Isabel! Enoughâye powers of mercy! 'tis enoughâ I fain would bless theeâbutâ (Faints. CONSTANTIA. Alas! he dies!â Wretch that I am! my blind precipitate haste Has cruelly abridged the few short minutes Of his lost life.âThou dear, unhappy Castro! GARCIA. Despair not, gentle lady! this surprise O'erpowers enfeebled nature; but I see Returning lifeâit flushes on his cheekâ (To the Council.) My honored friends, your presence may distress His wounded spirit; then awhile retire! And when he gains some slight return of strength, I will myself inform you of his wishesâ (the Officers withdraw. THE VICEROY. Where art thou, blessed spirit! tell me where! I thought my Isabel informed my soul, She was not murder'd by the cruel Castroâ Now my lost love! I hold thee once again: Speak to me! let thy soft angelic voice, If thou indeed art Isabel, disperse This darkness of my soul, that makes me fear A blessing, so beyond the reach of hope, Is but the mockery of mere delirium. CONSTANTIA. Thy Isabel yet lives: O! could her love Yet save thy dearer life! THE VICEROY. Kind angel! spare, Spare that vain thought! the hand of righteous Heaven Has marked my hour of deathâI feel it near; But thus to know, that I have not destroyed Thy innocence; to fold thee thus, And fondly resting my repentant spirit On the kind softness of thy tender bosom; To breathe my last in thy forgiving arms Is worth long centuries of guilty lifeâ But haste to tell me all thy wondrous fate. CONSTANTIA. If, in these moments of reviving love, I must again resign thee, yet my Castro! Yet in thy parting soul let me awaken The blest emotions of paternal joy. Let Isabel to thy embraces give A son most worthy of thy honored name! This injured youth, this brave accomplished hero, Formed by thy care, and child of thy adoption, Thy loved Sylveyra, is thy real son. THE VICEROY. Amazement! transport! Heaven my son restored! Come let me press thee with my dying hand! And pouring penitent tears into thy bosom Thus from thy pure heart wash the painful record Of all thy father's cruelty and guilt. SYLVEYRA. His worth, his kindness live for ever there THE VICEROY. Dear Garcia, seek that injured excellence The sweet VeloraâI have learnt the story Of their chaste loves, and her concealed attachment To our pure faith: it is by her alone, That I can make atonement to their virtues. (Exit Garcia. Tell me, my Isabel, and haste to tell me, How gracious providence has been thy shield! CONSTANTIA. Thou know'st that far from Lisbon, and my father, Within my sister's castle, 'twas my hope To hide the offspring of our secret marriage; There first I learnt, that frantic jealousy Impelled thee to desert thy injured wifeâ THE VICEROY. That cruel jealousy was raised to madness By the curst arts of a defeated rival. CONSTANTIA. The power of innocence, and pride of virtue, With the pure spirit of maternal love, Sustained my wounded heart: my generous sister Contrived the artful tale which haply led My friends, my father, and e'en thee to think me Sunk in the wished asylum of the tomb: So I was free to watch, with ceaseless care, The precious fruit of thy ill-fated loveâ THE VICEROY. Thou miracle of pure maternal virtue! O let me thank thee with these bursting tears Of fondest admiration! CONSTANTIA. When the mind Of my sweet boy first glowed with young ambition, It chanced thy valour raised thee to this sphere: I then resolved beneath a borrowed name, To visit India, with a hope to see Thy unsuspected son by youthful merit Attract thy notice: this, my dearest aim, To brave Sylveyra, thy departed friend, I first unfoldedâas his widowed sister, He sheltered me with well-devised concealment: That virtuous hero aided all my views With noblest zeal, and to thy wakened love Meant to restore us, when the afflictive chance Of battle robbed us of his kind support. THE VICEROY. My generous friend! I well remember all His care to fix in my unconscious heart The virtues of my childâOh! Isabel, To what long years of suffering has my frenzy Reduced thy spotless heart! and canst thou pardonâ SCENE IX. THE VICEROY, CONSTANTIA, SYLVEYRA, GARCIA, VELORA. THE VICEROY. And see another innocent, whom Castro Has basely tortured by injurious passion! O! Heaven, the sense of all your wrongs united O'erwhelms my fainting spirit. CONSTANTIA. Gracious Heaven, Relieve this anguish of his wounded soul. THE VICEROY. My lovely daughter, to this noble youth Now let me, as a gift of expiation, Present thy purity! no! no! my children! Ye must not kneel: to me alone belongs Humiliation; and my prostrate soul Bends to that innocence, which I have wronged, And may your generous hearts forget how deeply, Nor let your hate attend me to the grave. SYLVEYRA. My honored father, could our love preserve thee! THE VICEROY. 'Tis death alone can expiate my offences, And his dark shades are gathering fast around me, I yet, my son, in these affecting moments, Feel a fond pride in thy superior virtue: And may that virtue, may thy chaste affections Make thy pure days as full of peace and joy, As mine have been of turbulence and horror! Console thy peerless mother! let thy kindness Repay, if possible, my cruelty! And O! forever make this best of friends The model of thy life! my faithful Garcia! Thy friendship is the noblest legacy, That I can leave these most beloved of beings! My Isabel! where art thou? my dim eyes Have lost thee, and are strained in vain to find The dearest object of their failing sightâ With my last breath I bless theeâO farewell! Nor think too hardly of a heart, which still Doats on thy excellence! O! mercy Heaven! (Dies. GARCIA. Farewell, great spirit! formed to grace the earth With all the brightest qualities of man! O'er life's rough ocean 'twas thy wish to steer The course of steady virtue; but the storms Of passion drove thee from thy destined way: May all thy gallant deeds, and they were many, Be justly blazoned in the tints of glory! And be thy frailties buried in the grave! Or but remembered with a kind concern, To teach misguided man, that misery Haunts all the hasty steps of lawless passion; While gentler, just affections only bring Unclouded peace, and purity of joy!</field>
