      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. The gods of the Northern nations were not, like those of the Greeks, imagined to be immortal; they were exempted neither from pain nor death, and even those who escaped these evils during a series of ages, were at length to be destroyed at the last day, or, as it is stiled in the Sagas, “the Twilight of the Gods:” till that time should arrive, they were supposed to dwell in Valhalla, and to enjoy in a supreme degree those luxuries and pleasures which the people who worshipped them considered as the most desirable. Balder, the son of Odin, was highly celebrated among the gods for his exquisite beauty and consummate eloquence; his office as a deity was to guide the horse of day, called Skinfax, in his diurnal course, and he is therefore properly to be considered as the god of the sun. The death of Balder was effected by the artifices of Lok, the most malicious and baneful of the Gothic deities; Lok however dared not openly to destroy him with his own hand, but for this purpose he presented a spear of peculiar power to another of the sons of Odin, Hoder, who with this enchanted weapon unintentionally pierced his brother to the heart. After this misfortune, the soul of Balder, in conformity to the tenets of the Gothic religion, was supposed to descend to the dwelling of Hela, the goddess of the infernal realms. The grief in heaven on account of the death of Balder was extreme; Frea, the goddess of beauty, was peculiarly afflicted by the loss of her lover, and resolved to undertake a journey to the regions of death, in hopes of obtaining by her entreaties the release of Balder. This descent of Frea, and the success which attended it, are the subjects of the following Masque.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE MASQUE. Odin, God of War, and King of the other Deities. Thor, God of the Air. Niord, God of the Sea. Surtur, God of Fire. Lok, God of the Infernal Regions. Balder, God of the Sun. Hertha, Goddess of Fertility, and wife of Odin Frea, Goddess of Beauty. Hela, Goddess of Death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE. The Infernal Regions. BALDER. Thou land of horror! where eternal Frost The kingdom of Hela, or Death, is described as being in a state of continual darkness, and oppressed with a severe and perpetual winter. Noxious animals inhabited it, together with the ghosts of perjurers, assassins, and adulterers, and of all those who died not in battle, or of a violent death. Has built his icy throne, and dims the air With ever-hissing sleet; where sullen Night Has spread her dingy veil, and biting blasts Sweep o'er the solid seas and chill my frame; Must Balder ever pour the fruitless moan? Must Balder's sighs be mock'd by shivering ghosts, Shrill-shrieking from their caves? Must Balder's soul For ever shudder at the death-owl's song, And shrink aghast from speckled snakes that rear Their venom'd jaws, and horrid hiss around? Bright scenes of bliss! farewell!—ye splendid domes The hall of Odin. It was built of armour. In this place the gods assembled, and amused themselves with feasting, drinking mead, and listening to music. Edda Sœmundar. Grimnismal ix., For ever echoing with the joyful noise Of revelry and song harmonious; happy seats Of happy gods, where from the gold-tipt horn They quaff the honied nectar of the bee, With rapture list'ning to the thrilling strains That rush on sounding wings from Braga's harp Braga was the god of music and poetry., No more shall Balder in your shining halls Catch with transported soul the social joy, And mix exulting with celestial bands. No, Balder, no;—amid the giant-brood The giants of frost were inhabitants of this dreary kingdom., Amid the yelling ghosts of murderers Thou dwell'st!—no more the cheering light of heav'n Shall meet these sorrowing eyes; for here no beam Of morning bursts with softest lustre round, Nor here ambrosial eve with fragrant hand Scatters her sweets;—no silver-sounding voice Melodious warbles to my sorrowing soul.— The sooty raven sails around my head, And harshly chaunts his hoarsest descant here. Thou flaming steed of day! whose golden mane Waves in the air, and pours a flood of light, Oft' have I sprung upon thy shining back To trace the radiant path, then mounted high The blue expanse of heaven, and girt with beams Balder wore a belt in his course round the earth which communicated light and heat to every part of it. Of dazzling glory wing'd my course rejoicing. Alas! how chang'd! in midnight gloom enwrapt, The Lord of Splendor groans in Hela's halls, For ever banish'd from the realms of light.— Groves of Valhalla Valhalla is the name of the Gothic heaven.! from whose waving boughs Sweet music, mix'd with Mimer's soothing murmur The stream of Mimer ran through Valhalla; its waters inspired the drinker with wisdom, eloquence, and a poetical spirit., For ever floated on the fragrant air; Oft have I wander'd in thy flowery paths, Holding cœlestial converse; oft I've sought Thy stillest shades, and caught with eager ear The melting strains that burst from Braga's shell Attun'd to love; and there the beauteous form Of Frea Frea, the goddess of beauty, was the daughter of Niord, god of the sea. blooming as the orient day Would blushing meet her Balder's steps retir'd, Enamour'd gaze upon my godlike limbs, And drink the honied accents of my lips; Then from her beaming eyes the glance of love Quick shot.—Dear scenes of fleeting joy, farewell! What now avails the form that Frea lov'd? What now avails the eloquence that charm'd The listnening gods?—A brother's bloody hand Blasted my bliss, and dash'd me from the height Of joy to misery!—Ye hated maids The Fatal Sisters, or Nornies; they were three in number. Urd, who presided over the past; Verandi, over the present; and Schulda, over the future. They were supposed to weave for every human being a woof on which his fate depended.! When first ye 'gan to weave the woof of fate, Ye scatter'd wide around the flowers of spring; At length the raven croak'd—with joy ye snatch'd The cords of woe, and dipp'd the cursed web Deep in the pitchy waters of despair.— O thou! who sitt'st upon thy shining throne Array'd in splendor! Odin, Odin! hear The sorrows of a son, and turn thine eye, Moist with paternal grief, from scenes of glory; Pierce thro' the thickest horrors which surround me, Extend thy daring arm, and drag thy child From caves of darkness to thy beamy hall.— Father, I ask in vain—it is not thine To break the firm decrees of Fate unchanging; But Balder wretched Balder here must mourn For endless years.—And thou, all-beauteous goddess, Cast from thy aching heart all fond record Of Balder's love—What beam of living light Shoots trembling round? What wasted perfume scents The dusky air? Some pitying god descends To visit these sad scenes.—'Tis she! 'tis she!— FREA. (Entering.) Where is the lovely god that Hoder tore From Frea's fond embrace?—Again I clasp him, Again my tear-worn eyes behold my Balder, Yes, son of Odin, from the starry realms Of bliss I come to seek thy black abode; Without thee heaven itself is misery, And all its boasted pleasures deadly woe. On Odin's winged steed The name of Odin's horse was Sleipner. He was supposed to have had eight feet, and was celebrated for his wonderful swiftness. I sped my course, Nine days The particulars of this descent are chiefly taken from Mallet's Northern Antiquities. Vol. II. his rapid feet unceasing skimm'd A measureless extent of vallies dark; At length the foaming tide of Giall Giall was the name of the river which separated the earth from the infernal regions. stopp'd him; High o'er its waves a lofty bridge arose On golden pedestals, a steel-clad warrior For ever guards its entrance.—Who art thou, He cried aloud, thus hastening to the halls Of gloomy death? No livid paleness stains The roses of thy cheeks, no deadly dimness Damps the keen lustre of those eyes that beam With living fire; thou art no child of Hela.— Away, I answer'd, 'tis a goddess hastes To Hela's halls.—I lash'd my snorting steed— He shook with thund'ring tread the rattling pile, Nor stopp'd till Hela's iron gates oppos'd His winged steps; then, like a flaming star, He shot aloft in air and bore me swift Above the towering walls.—I tremble still, Tho' Balder's arms embrace me.— BALDER. Fear not, Frea. FREA. Alas! my Balder, had this arm the power To force thee upward from the cave of death, Then would eternal joy reward my toil.— But Hela's iron chains no hand can break Against her pleasure; and her gloomy soul Joys in the anguish of the tortur'd ghost. BALDER. And can that winning form intreat in vain? Can Hela hear unmov'd thy suppliant voice? No, Frea, no—upon thy rosy lips Persuasion sits resistless, charming all To kind compliance.—Haste, accost the goddess.— FREA. Come from thy murky cells, Where midnight darkness dwells, Thou dreadful maid; Come from thy chilly halls.— The weeping Frea calls, And seeks thy saving aid. HELA. (From within.) Hence, hence, away; No soothing charms From Hela's arms Shall snatch her prey. FREA. By Allfather's sacred head The Goths acknowledged a Supreme Being, whom they called Allsader, or Father of all. They did not suppose him to dwell with the rest of the gods in Valhalla, but believed him to be a deity of a superior nature, and of an eternal existence., Which bowing shakes the lofty sky, And regions of the dead; By the holy ash which rears The sacred ash of an immense size which grew in Valhalla, was called Hydrasil. Seated under its shade, Odin administred justice. One of its roots pierced to the dwelling of the Fates. Its waving honors high; I charge thee, awful pow'r, To quit thy gloomy bow'r, And yield to Frea's tears. HELA. (Entering.) I come with iron heart, To hear the fruitless prayer; Speak, and swift depart To realms of brighter air. FREA. Deep in thy misty caves my Balder lies; Alas! how wither'd by the touch of woe! Dim is the lustre of his fading eyes, And sullen sadness marks his manly brow. Quick thro' his frame divine chill langours shoot; The boasted roses of his cheeks are pale; The winning tongue of eloquence is mute, And rending sighs his heaving breast assail. Come gentle Pity clad in snowy vest And speed thy hasty flight to Hela's cave; Then smiling hover o'er her melting breast, And sweetly teach her yielding heart to save. And can'st thou, Hela, cast a ruthless look On this sad scene of desolated charms?— Tear the black leaf from Fate's eternal book, And give the grief-worn Balder to my arms. Together let us climb the burning arch The Rainbow; called by the Goths Bisrost, and supposed to burn. It was accounted the bridge from earth to heaven., Which darts its many-colour'd beams on high; Together let us speed the rapid march, And seek the radiant palace of the sky. Yield, Hela, yield; Valhalla's mournful towers No longer echo with the jocund sound, No longer gladness gilds the passing hours, But pale-ey'd Sorrow casts her shadows round. Since Balder sunk untimely to the tomb, Dim are the lingering beams of rising day, The pale moon shrouds her silver orb in gloom And sickly nature doffs her bright array— HELA. Frea, no more, When all the gods of nature lave With briny tears thy Balder's grave, Then Balder I restore; Yes, by Allfather's sacred head, When all the gods of nature lave With briny tears thy Balder's grave, He quits the regions of the dead. Hence, away.— FREA. Enough, enough, I mount with speed, And lash my winged steed To realms of day. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE. Valhalla. The Gods assembled in Odin's Hall. ODIN. Welcome, fair Queen of Love, to Odin's hall. Say, hast thou mov'd the stubborn soul of Hela, By soft persuasion and resistless sighs, To yield the much-lov'd Balder back to light? FREA. Great king of gods and men, the only boon That Hela granted to my sorrowing soul Was this; when all the gods of nature weep The briny tear of grief on Balder's grave, Then from the horrid caves of night he comes To grace Valhalla's halls; but golden hope Has not yet fled the woe-worn Frea's bosom; Still may my soothing words entice the tear From pitying gods, and snatch from Hela's arms Her splendid prey.— (Continues addressing Odin.) Lord of the hosts of war Odin was the chief of the Gothic deities, and the god of war; he administered justice in heaven, and was acquainted with futurity by means of a raven which was sent to him by Schulda, one of the Fates. The commands of Odin were usually executed by the seven Valkyries who attended upon his table, and selected those in battle who were doomed to die., In beaming armour bright, Thou driv'st the scythed car Amid the fearful fight— Lord of the starry sky, In dreadful majesty, Thou wield'st the golden spear, And call'st with awful sound, Cœlestials hear, And throng around Their warrior king.— The pitchy raven floats On glossy wing, Then to Odin hastens nigh, Checks the hoarseness of his notes, And whispers sounds of dread futurity; He comes from Schulda's black abodes To seek thy piercing look— And Odin reads to listening gods Then Fates' immortal book.— Say, shall no sorrowing parent's tear Bedew thy Balder's sable bier? Wilt thou not weep thy child forlorn, Thy blooming child by Hela torn From halls of bliss To caves of dark despair? Yes, Odin, yes, I mark the gushing drops which stain A father's cheek, Those gushing drops thy anguish speak, Balder shall live again And cleave the realms of air. ODIN. Odin drops the tear, And wets thy Balder's bier. FREA. (Addressing Hertha.) Queen of the fertile earth Hertha was the wife of Odin, and the goddess of fertility. The following account of her festival is given us by Tacitus in his admirable treatise, de Moribus Germaniæ:—“Herthum, id est Terram Matrem colunt, camque intervenire rebus hominum, invehi populis arbitrantur: est in insula oceani castum nemus, dicatumque in co vehiculum veste contectum: attingere uni sacerdoti concessum: is adesse penetrali deam intelligit, vectamque bubus feminis multa cum veneratione prosequitur: læti tunc dies; festa loca, quæcumque adventu hospitioque dignatur: non bella incunt; non arma sumunt; clausum omne ferrum: pax et quies tunc tantum nota, tunc tantum amata; donec idem sacerdos satiatam conversatione mortalium deam templo reddat; mox vehiculum et vestes, et si credere velis, numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur. Servi ministrant; quos statim idem lacus haurit; arcanus hinc terror sanctaque ignorantia, quid sit illud quod tantum perituri vident.”—It is not improbable that the feast known by the name of Easter, was originally this feast of Hertha., Whose all-creative hand First gave the sons of man their birth; Whose sweetly sounding voice With soft command, First bade the desert land rejoice; Bade her fruitful bosom pour The shady tree, the painted flower; Bade her people every plain, And fill with life the teeming main; Whene'er thy stately form appears On mortal shore, No war nor battle's sound Is heard the world around; No more the armed soldier rears The tined lance, And nature groans no more.— Before thy silver car The rosy pleasures dance, Balmy perfume scents the air, Nature smiles in rich array, And double glory gilds the day. Say, Hertha, wilt thou drop the tear On youthful Balder's sable bier? HERTHA. Hertha drops the tear, And wets thy Balder's bier. FREA. (Addressing Thor.) God of the floating air Thor, the god of the weather;—with a mace he rules the giants of frost, and with his iron gauntlet he hurls the thunder,, Whose gleamy lightnings tear The pine high-waving on the lofty rock, Whose thunders shake with dreadful shock The trembling rills; Whose sable storm-clouds pour The salutary shower, And swell the parched hills; God of the howling blast, Whose rushing tempests haste With sullen roar; The forest bows its waving pride, The ocean heaves its swelling tide Loud dashing on the shore— God of the iron-mace, Which names the giant-race, Say, wilt thou drop the pitying tear On youthful Balder's sable bier? THOR. Thor shall drop the pitying tear, And wet thy Balder's sable bier. FREA. (Addressing Niord.) Lord of the boundless deep, Whose glittering waters gently swell And kiss the rocky steep; When thunders howl around And tempests yell, Thy moving plain repeats the direful sound; Thy foamy waves arise, And lash the darken'd skies In dread commotion;— Then by the lightning's livid glare Thou stalk'st serene thro' murky air Which veils the raging ocean.— But soon the winged tempests go, Soon the rattling thunders cease, Sun-beams gild the mountain-brow, And Thor in zephyrs whispers peace; Then thou bid'st the roaring main Gently sink to rest again— Smooth its peaceful bosom rose In calm repose, And stillness hover'd on the gales of spring, When Braga touch'd the quivering string On Niord's shore; On its glassy surface stood The father of the flood, He bade the bard cœlestial pour His softest notes— The melting music floats Upon the peaceful wave— Come from thy dewy cave, My father cries, Arise, arise, Let the azure waters lave Thy snowy limbs and golden hair; Haste in dazzling beauty bright To charm the tuneful Braga's sight.— He spake, and Frea rose to realms of air.— Then Niord clasp'd me to his breast And all the parent's pride confest. Now, will my father's heart disdain To ease his daughter's piercing pain? Or wilt thou drop the pitying tear, On youthful Balder's sable bier? NIORD. Niord drops the tear, And wets thy Balder's bier. FREA. (Addressing Surtur.) King of resistless fire Surtur was the chief of the spirits of fire; his dwelling was called Muspelheim., Whose desolating flames From Hecla's cliffs aspire, Whose scorching breath, The torch of death, The proudest hero tames; Where'er thy furious course is sped Nature bows her wither'd head— Thy fatal car outstrips the wind, Thy flaming coursers' nostrils pour The wide consuming shower— Destruction flies behind; She rears her red right hand And with her fiery besom sweeps the blasted land.— Say, Surtur, wilt thou drop the tear On youthful Balder's sable bier? SURTUR. Surtur drops the tear, And wets thy Balder's bier. FREA. (Addressing Lok.) God of the nether world, Whose deadly arrow hurl'd The blooming Balder to the caves of night, O, let not Schulda write His everlasting doom; O, let not Balder's tomb For ever stand, But snatch with pitying hand From Hela's curs'd abode The fallen god; Revive, revive his wither'd charms, And give him back to Frea's arms. Drop, O Lok, the pitying tear On youthful Balder's sable bier. LOK. Away, away, Lok ne'er will weep— Let Hela keep Her splendid prey. FREA. By the ghosts' eternal moan, By the murderer's dying groan, By the screech-owl's song of death, By the night-mare's baneful breath, By the famish'd eagle's scream, By the meteor's awful gleam, By the slaughter'd infant's blood, By the roar of Giall's flood, By the mandrake's fatal yell It was formerly believed that in plucking up the mandrake a scream issued from the ground which proved immediately fatal to those who heard it., By all the horrors of thy hell, I charge thee weep the briny tear On youthful Balder's sable bier. LOK. No—tho' Valhalla's towering wall Around these sinewy limbs should fall, Tho' Skinfax plunge his flaming head Amid the caverns of the dead, Tho' Surtur aim his fiery dart And heap his flames around my heart, Tho' Niord's foaming main should roar, And dash me lifeless on the shore; Tho' Thor should hurl his iron mace And stain with gore this hated face; Tho' Odin's self in wrath should rear His golden spear And shining shield, This stubborn heart shall never yield— Hela shall hold her splendid prey While countless ages roll away.
