      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Enter LUXURY and POVERTY. LUXURY. Follow me, daughter, that you may perform Your office. Pov. I do follow; but am ignorant, Where will our journey end. Lux. 'Tis here:—behold, This is the house: go in. [Exit Poverty. Lux. (To the Spectators.) Lest any of you Be lost in error, I'll in brief conduct you In the right road, provided you will hear. First then, and who I am, and who she is, That enter'd here, I'll tell, if you'll attend. Plautus has given me the name of Luxury, The other is my daughter, Poverty. Now, at my impulse why she enter'd here, Learn, and be all attention, while I tell. There is a certain youth dwells in this house, Who by my aid has squander'd his estate. Since then for my support there's nothing left, I've given him my daughter, whom to live with. As for our play, expect not I should tell The plot. The old men, who are coming hither, Will ope the matter to you. In the Greek 'Tis nam'd The Treasure, which Philemon wrote. Our Poet this translated, calling it Trinummus; and this name, he begs, may stand. No more.—Farewell.—Be silent, and attend. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter MEGARONIDES. 'Tis but an irksome act to task a friend, And rate him for his failings: yet in life It is a wholesome and a wise correction.— Now must I chide this neighbour-friend of mine, Howe'er unwilling: justice bids me do it.— Our morals are so tainted with corruption, That our souls sicken with it e'en to death: And evil manners, like well-water'd plants, Have shot up in abundance; we may gather A plenteous harvest of them. Most prefer A private interest to the public good, Which yields to partial favour. This is hurtful In many points, is shocking, and a bar As well to private as to general welfare. SCENE II. CALLICLES, in entering. See that you deck our God Lar with a crown, And, Wife, do reverence,—that our habitation With all good fortune may be blest,—and you— (Aside) That I may shortly see you in your grave. Meg. Oh, here he is,—a boy in his own old age,— Has done a fault, for which he should be chid.— I'll up to him. Cal. Whose voice is't sounds so near me? Meg. A friend,—if you are such, as I would wish you,— If otherwise,—a foe, enrag'd against you. Cal. Oh, Megaronides, my friend, and years-mate, Save you,—how fare you? Meg. Save you, Callicles: How do you do? how have you done? Cal. So, so. Meg. Your wife, how fares she? Cal. Better than I wish. Meg. Troth I am glad to hear she's pure and hearty. Cal. You're glad to hear what sorrows me. Meg. I wish The same to all my friends as to myself. Cal. But hearkye—how is your good dame? Meg. Immortal; Lives, and is like to live. Cal. An happy hearing! Pray heav'n, that she may last to outlive you! Meg. If she were your's, faith I should wish the same. Cal. Say, shall we make a swop? I take your wife, You mine? I warrant you, you would not get The better in the bargain. Meg. Nor would you Surprise me unawares. Cal. Nay, but in troth You would not even know what you're about. Meg. Keep what you've got,—The evil that we know Is best.—To venture on an untried ill, Would puzzle all my knowledge how to act.— Well,—give me a good life, and that's a long one.— But mind me now, all joking set apart, I came to you on purpose.— Cal. For what purpose? Meg. To rate you soundly. Cal. Me? Meg. Pray who is here Besides us two? Cal. There's nobody. Meg. Then why D'ye ask me, if 'tis you I mean to chide? Except you think myself would school myself.— But to the point.—If that the ancient sense Of truth and honesty is dead within you, If evil manners in your disposition Have wrought a change, and that your disposition Is chang'd unto those manners, if the old You keep not, but shake off, and catch the new, You'll such a surfeit give to all your friends, They'll sicken at your sight, and loath to hear you. Cal. How came it in your mind to hold this language? Meg. For that it doth behove all honest men To keep them both from blame and from suspicion. Cal. Both cannot be. Meg. For why? Cal. Is that a question? Myself of my own bosom keep the key, To shut out misdemeanour; but suspicion Is harbour'd in another's. Thus if I Suspect you to have stol'n the crown of Jove, From where he stands in the high Capitol, What though you have not done it, I am free However to suspect you, nor can you Prevent me.—But I long to know your business, Whate'er it be. Meg. Have you a friend, or any one, Whose judgment you can trust? Cal. I'll tell you fairly; There are, I know are friends; there are, I think so; There are, whose dispositions and whose minds I cannot know, or whether to enroll them Among my friends or foes. But you I hold Of all my fast friends the most fast.—Then tell me,— If you do know of any thing by me Unwittingly, or wrongfully committed, If you accuse me not, then you yourself Will be to blame. Meg. I know it; and 'twere just, If I for any other cause came hither. Cal. I wait for what you'll say. Meg. Then, first of all, The general report speaks ill of you: Our townsmen call you Gripe-all; and with some You go by th'name of Vulture; friends or foes, They say you little reck, whom you devour. Cal. As to this matter, Megaronides, I have it in my power, and have it not. Report is none of mine; but that report May be unmerited, is in my power. Meg. How say you? Was not Charmides your friend, The owner of this house here? Cal. Was, and is.— To win belief let this transaction speak.— When by his son's extravagance and waste He saw his fortune shatter'd, and himself Drawn nigh on poverty, his only girl Grown up, his wife (her mother) dead besides, Departing for Selucia, to my charge He left his whole estate, and with it too The maid his daughter, and that rake his son. Had he not been my friend, he scarce, I trust, Had trusted me. Meg. That youth, you knew a rake, Committed to your trust and confidence,— Do you reform him? force him to be frugal? That, that indeed it had been fitter far For you to work,—to make him, if you can, Of fairer reputation,—not that you Should to the self-same infamy with him Be accessary, with his vile dishonour Mixing your own. Cal. How have I acted? Meg. Like A villain. Cal. Sir, that name is none of mine. Meg. Did you not buy this house—What, no reply?— Where now you dwell? Cal. I bought it, gave the money, 'Twas forty Minæ, gave it to the youth. Meg. You gave the money? Cal. Yes, nor do repent me. Meg. O ward committed to untrusty guard! Have you not giv'n him by this act a sword To stab himself withal?—Can it be other?— A fond intriguing spark, young, weak in mind, To give him money, wherewith to build up His folly to the height, already founded. Cal. Should I not then have paid him? Meg. No, you should not; Nor bought of him, nor sold him any thing, To put it in his power to be worse.— Have you not gull'd one to your trust confided, And outed from his house, who gave the trust? Brave care indeed! a pretty guardianship! Be you the young man's ward: he'd manage better. Cal. I am so overcome with your reproaches, That what was trusted to my faith and silence, Not to impart to any, or divulge, I'm now of force compell'd t'entrust you with. Meg. Trust me, and you shall have it on demand.— Cal. Look all about you,—see if no one's by; Look round. Meg. There's no one near,—I hearken to you. Cal. Peace then, and I will speak. When Charmides Went hence abroad, he shew'd me in this house A Treasure, in a certain closet lodg'd— But look, look all around. Meg. Here's no one near. Cal. Three thousand Philippeans.—He and I Being alone, with tears he did beseech me By friendship and by faith, that I'd not trust His son, or any other, who might let The secret out. Now, if he safe return, His own will I restore him; should he die, Why then I've wherewithal to portion out My charge his daughter, and to see her plac'd In such a station as is worthy of her. Meg. Good heav'ns! how soon, and little said, you've made Another man of me! I came to you Quite other.—But, proceed, as you begun. Cal. What shall I tell you more? the father's caution, My faithfulness, this secret, the sad son Had near o'erthrown from the foundation. Meg. How? Cal. Being six days in the country, in my absence, Without my knowledge, not consulting me, He set the house to sale. Meg. The wolf! his stomach Was sharper set: he watch'd the dog asleep, To ravage the whole flock. Cal. And he had done it, But that the dog first smelt him out.—And now I fain would ask you in my turn, what was it My duty then to do? give me to know. Had it been fitter I had shewn the son This treasure, against which the father pray'd me? Or should I have permitted, that this house Should own another master, and the gold Devolve to him that bought it? I myself Chose rather to become the purchaser; Paid down the cash, this treasure to preserve Untouch'd, and render back unto my friend. I bought not for myself, or for my use; But for my friend this house I purchas'd, paid For him my money. Was this right, or wrong? Say, Megaronides,—I confess the fact. These, these are my misdoings, this my avarice! For these are slanders on me spread abroad! Meg. No more,—the chider's chid.—You've tied my tongue, And nothing can I answer. Cal. Aid me now, I pray you, with your counsels;—let this be One common care to both of us. Meg. Agreed. Cal. Where shall I find you a while hence? Meg. At home. Cal. Any commands? Meg. Be trusty. Cal. Do not doubt me. Meg. But heark ye.— Cal. What is it you want? Meg. The spark, Where lives he now?— Cal. Oh,—when he sold the house, The back part he reserv'd unto himself. Meg. That's what I wish'd to know.—Now, Sir, your servant.— But hearkye. Cal. Well, what now? Meg. The maiden, she's With you? Cal. She is, and I do tender her Ev'n as my own. Meg. 'Tis well done in you. Cal. Would you Command me farther, ere I go? Meg. Your servant. [Exit Callicles. SCENE III. MEGARONIDES alone. In troth there cannot be more errant dolts, More barefac'd fibbers, and more prating puppies, Than these officious fools, the Busy-Bodies. And I too should rank with them, thus to credit Their groundless suppositions. Ev'ry thing They will pretend to know, yet nothing know. They'll dive into your breast, and learn your thoughts Present and future: nay they can discover What the king whisper'd in her highness' ear, And tell what past in Juno's chat with Jove. They know what never was, nor ever will be: Whether they praise or dispraise right or wrong, They care not, but invent whate'er they please.— This Callicles, for instance—Men's report Pronounc'd him for society unfit, For that he spoil'd a young man of his fortunes. I, prompted by their scandal, sallied forth To chide my friend, though blameless.—Ill reports, Trac'd to their root, unless it well appear What ground and what authority they have, Should turn on those that spread them.—Public good Requires it should be so.—These idle chatterers, That know what they don't know, I fain would lessen, And shut up their fools tongues within their teeth. [Exit Megaronides. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter LYSITELES. What misery to myself do I create, On many things thus inward ruminating! I teaze me, fret me, weary out my mind, Which schools me, as it were, like a strict master. It is not plain, nor have I weigh'd sufficiently, What life 'twere best to follow, whether rather Attend to thrift, or yield me up to Love. I cannot tell, which is most pleasurable, Nor am I rightly satisfied.—Suppose We try both fairly:—in the cause I'll be Both judge and culprit.—Good! it likes me well, I'll do so.—First then we'll discourse of Love.— Love only seeks to draw into his toils The easy, willing natures; these he courts, Subtly cajoles, and seeks occasions apt To win them to him. Love's a gentle flatterer, An hook that grapples hearts, an errant fibber, A dainty mouth'd, a nice, a greedy niggard, A filcher of affections, pimp to those That play at bo-peep, skulk in hiding holes; A pryer into secrets,—last, a beggar. He that is stricken with sharp-pointed kisses, Will find his substance in a trice decay. “My sweet, my honey, if you love me, if “You have the spirit, won't you give me? do now.” Then instantly the gudgeon—“Eh! I will, “My eyes, my own dear eyes,—aye, that and more, “If you require it.”—Thus she strikes the fool, For more and more still asking. Nor is this Sufficient; something more must still be added, For entertainments, feastings and carousings. Grants she the favour of a night? She brings Her whole retinue with her, such a train Of waiting-women, such a tribe of dressers, Minstrels, and lacqueys, all such huge devourers, Such wasters of his substance, that the lover From his extreme complacence is undone. When I reflect within me, and consider, How cheap they hold one who is little worth, Love, get thee gone—I like thee not—Away— I hold no converse with thee.—Although sweet His feastings and carousings, Love has yet A smatch of bitter to create disgust. Love shuns the noisy bustle of the bar, Drives off relations, and oft banishes Himself from his own sight. There's no one, who Would wooe him for companion. Thousand ways Love should be held a stranger, kept at distance, Wholly abstain'd from. Hapless, into Love Who plunges headlong; greater his destruction, Than to have leapt down toppling from a rock.— Love, get thee gone then,—I divorce thee from me, Nor ever be thou friend of mine.—Go, torture Those that are bound unto thee.—I am bent Henceforward to apply my mind to thrift, Although the toil be great. Hence good men gather Gain, esteem, credit, reputation: This The price of virtue.—'Tis my choice to herd With good men rather than the vain and dissolute. SCENE II. Enter PHILTO. Phil. Where has he ta'en himself? Lys. I'm here, my father. Command me what you will, nor shall there be In me reluctance. Think not that I skulk, Or hide me from your sight. Phil. You will do well, And like your other actions, to observe Due reverence to your father. O my son! I would not have you with the profligate Hold any conversation, in the forum, Or in the street. The manners of this age I know: Bad men would fain corrupt the good, And make them like themselves: Our evil manners Confound, disorder every thing: The greedy, The envious, turn what's sacred to profane, The public good to private interest.— They gape for gain, like the parch'd earth for showers.— This grieves me; this torments me; night and day I ring the same peal, bidding you beware. These plunderers only can refrain their hands From what they cannot touch. The word else with them Is, touch and take. O but to see these villainies, Draws tears from me; to think my life prolong'd To such a race!—O that I had but follow'd Those that are gone before me!—Our vile moderns Commend the ancient manners, but withal Defile what they commend. O then, my son, Be not enamour'd of their arts, not taint Your disposition with them. Live like me, Following our antient manners. Do what I Advise you. For these vile and filthy manners, Which good men must dishonour, I disdain them. Lys. Sir, from my youth up to my present age I've bound me to your precepts and commands. Though free from birth and breeding, to your bidding I hold me still a slave, and deem it just My will should bend to yours. Phil. Suppose a youth To combat with his will, whether 'twere best To be, as best his will should think, or rather Such as his parents and relations wish him: If the will masters him, all's over with him, By it he'll be enslav'd: but if his will He masters, while he lives he shall be stiled A conqueror of conquerors. If your will You've vanquish'd, you not vanquish'd by your will, You've reason to rejoice. 'Tis better far You should be as you should be, than be such as Your will would have you. Fairer their repute, The will who conquer, than those conquer'd by it. Lys. This prudence, as a buckler to my youth, I ever had: I studiously forbore To go, where vice was plotted as in council, To roam the streets at mid-night, to defraud Another of his right, or to beget Vexation, Sir, to you, who are my father. I've ever kept your precepts as a rule To regulate my conduct. Phil. Wherefore this? What's right you've acted for yourself, not me: My days are almost past: 'Tis your concern then. That man's an upright man, who don't repent him, That he is upright; he, who seeks alone Self-satisfaction, merits not that title: The man, that thinks but meanly of himself, Shews there's a just and honest nature in him. Still follow up good actions with good actions, Heap'd on each other. Lys. For this purpose, father, I would entreat a certain favour of you. Phil. What is it? tell me, for I long to grant it. Lys. There is a youth here of a noble family, My friend, and of my years, who his affairs Too heedlessly has manag'd, too unthinkingly. I'd fain do him a kindness, if that you Refuse not. Phil. What, from your own purse? Lys. From mine. For what is your's is mine, and mine is your's. Phil. Is he in want? Lys. In want. Phil. Had he a fortune? Lys. He had. Phil. How lost he it? at sea? by commerce? In the slave trade? by traffick? Lys. None of these. Phil. How then? Lys. In sooth by gentle living, Sir: Something too much in pleasure has he squander'd. Phil. In troth you speak of him as of an intimate: A man forsooth, whose fortunes were not shatter'd By any good demeanour;—he's a friend, A fine one for you, with such qualities! Lys. I would relieve the wants of one distrest, One that is free from fault. Phil. The beggar's thanks He scarce deserves, who gives him wherewithal To buy him meat and drink; for what is given Is lost, and only serves to lengthen out A life of misery.—I say not this, For that I would not do most willingly What you desire, but in the way of caution, That I might shew you, not to pity others, So as yourself to others may become An object too of pity. Lys. 'Twere a shame To leave, not help him in adversity. Phil. 'Twere better shame than blame, though both are spelt With the same letters. Lys. Thanks be to the Gods, Our ancestors wise care, and your's, my father, We have an handsome fortune: then to shew A kindness to a friend, is not to blame; 'Twere a shame rather not to do it. Phil. Tell me,— If from a sum how large soever you Substract a part, remains there more or less? Lys. Less surely. But you know, what people cry To niggardly curmudgeons.—“May you have not That which you have, and have what you have not,— Misfortune; since you will not let yourself, Or others have enjoyment.” Phil. Right;—but verily, He that has nothing, son, is fit for nothing. Lys. Thanks to the Gods, Sir, we have wherewithal T'enjoy ourselves, and spare for friendly uses. Phil. I can deny you nothing you would have. Whose wants would you relieve?—Come, tell your father: Speak boldly to me. Lys. 'Tis young Lesbonicus, Charmides' son, who lives here at this house. Phil. He, who has eat up all he had, and more! Lys. Do not reproach him, Sir: since many things Befall a man, both wish'd for, and unwish'd. Phil. You are mistaken, son, nor judge aright In what you say. A wise man is the maker Of his own fortune, and except he prove A bungling workman, little can befall him, Which he would wish to change. Lys. Sure, in this kind Of workmanship much labour there doth need One's life to frame and fashion with repute. But Lesbonicus, Sir, is young,—consider. Phil. 'Tis not by years that wisdom is acquired, But waits on disposition. Wisdom is The food of age, which lends to wisdom relish. But say, what would you give him? Lys. Nothing, Sir, So you permit me from his hands to accept A gift most rare. Phil. What, thus relieve his wants? Lys. This very way. Phil. I fain would learn the manner. Lys. I'll tell you.—Know you not, what family He's of? Phil. I know: of good and reputable. Lys. He has a grown up sister: her, my father, I would fain take to wife. Phil. Without a portion? Lys. Without a portion. Phil. Marry her? Lys. 'Tis so;— And you no loser. Thus you will bestow A special favour on him, neither can you By any other means assist him more. Phil. And shall I suffer you to take a wife Without a portion? Lys. You must suffer me; And by it to our family you'll add Increase of honour. Phil. I could here pour forth A budget-full of sayings, learned saws, And antique stories, which my age would warrant; But since I see your purpose is to add New friendships, new connections to our house, E'en though I were averse to the alliance, I'd give you my permission,—ask her, marry her. Lys. The Gods preserve you to me!—Do but add To this one favour more. Phil. That one, what is it? Lys. I'll tell you: go to him yourself, yourself Procure her for me. Phil. Hey-day! I a pimp? Lys. 'Twill sooner be transacted, and by you Done firm: one word in this affair from you Will weigh more than an hundred words from me. Phil. I'm willing to oblige you.—I'll about it. Lys. My most sweet father!—here he lives—this house— His name is Lesbonicus—do this thing Effectually.—I'll wait for you at home. [Exit. SCENE III. PHILTO alone. This is not for the best, nor do I think 'Tis right, but yet 'tis better than if worse. I have this consolation to my mind:— Who thwarts the inclinations of his son In every point, save those in which himself Alone has satisfaction, is a fool, Plagues his own soul, nor is the better for it; And stirring up a storm that's out of season, Makes the hoar winter of old age more sharp. But the door opens, whither I was going; And Lesbonicus, he himself comes forth Most aptly with his servant. I'll aloof. [Retires at a distance. SCENE IV. Enter LESBONICUS and STASIMUS. 'Tis under fifteen days, since forty Minæ You did receive from Callicles for this house. Is it not, Stasimus, as I say? Stas. Methinks On due consideration I remember, That so it is. Les. What has been done with them? Stas. Eat, drank, anointed, washed away in bagnios, Cooks, butchers, poulterers, fishmongers, confectioners, Perfumers, have devour'd them;—gone as soon, As is a grain of corn thrown to an ant. Les. Why, all these must have cost less than six Minæ. Stas. But what you gave your mistresses? Les. I count Six more for that. Stas. What—I have cheated? Les. Oh, In that indeed my reckoning is most heavy. Stas. You cannot eat your cake and have it too;— Unless you think your money is immortal. The fool too late, his substance eaten up, Reckons the cost. Les. Th'account is not apparent. Stas. Th'account's apparent, but the money's gone. You did receive of Callicles forty Minæ; He by assignment had your house. Les. 'Tis true. Phil. (Overhearing.) Our neighbour then, it seems, has sold his house: And when his father from abroad returns, He must e'en lodge him in the street, except He creep into the belly of his son. Stas. Count to the Banker due Olympic Drachms A thousand. Les. I engag'd for. Stas. Threw away, Say rather.—You stood bound for a wild spark, Who, you declared, was rich. Les. 'Tis true, I did so. Stas. 'Tis true, the money's gone. Les. It is indeed.— I saw him in distress, and pitied him. Stas. For others you've compassion, for yourself You've neither shame nor pity. Phil. (At a distance.) It is time I should make up to him. Les. Is not that Philto, Who's coming hither? Sure, 'tis he himself. Stas. I wish he were my slave with all his property. Phil. To Lesbonicus and to Stasimus, The master and the servant, Philto wishes All happiness and health. Les. Heav'n grant you, Philto, All that you wish and want! How does your son? Phil. You've his best wishes. Les. He has mine,—'tis mutual. Stas. Best wishes! what avails that phrase, unless Best services attend them?—I may wish To have my liberty, but wish in vain; My master, to be frugal,—all in vain. Phil. My son has sent me to you, to propose A bond of friendship 'twixt you, and alliance. Your sister he would marry, and I hold The same opinion, wish it. Les. Oh, I know you;— Your cruel mockery I perceive:—because You have an ample and right good estate, You come to flout and jest at my misfortunes. Phil. As I'm a man,—as you are,—the great God So love me,—as I came not to deride:— Nor do I think you worthy.—What I said, Is true:—My son beg'd me to ask for him Your sister, Sir, in marriage. Les. My affairs How they are circumstanc'd, I can't be ignorant:— My fortunes are not to be match'd with yours.— Then seek another, and more fair alliance. Stas. Art mad? art in your senses? to reject This proffer'd match?—Why you have found a friend, Will help you at a pinch. Les. Away, you rascal! Stas. Were I to budge a foot, you'd bid me stay. Les. (To Phil.) Would you ought else, Sir?—You have got my answer. Phil. I trust that you will shew to me more favour Than now I have experienc'd. Or in word Or deed to play the trifler, would ill suit One of my years. Stas. Faith, what he says is true. Les. Add but another word, I'll tear your eyes out. Stas. Do—I will speak, though blind. Phil. You tell me now, We are not on a footing; that your means Don't equal ours. Les. I say so. Phil. What of that?— If you were present at a public feast, And haply some great man was plac'd beside you, Of the choice cates serv'd up in heaps before him Would you not taste, but at the table rather Sit dinnerless, because he neighbour'd you? Les. Sure I should eat, if he forbade me not. Stas. And I, ev'n if he did;—so cram myself, I'd stuff out both my cheeks:—I'd seize upon The daintiest bits before him, nor give way to him In matters that concern'd my very being. At table no one should be shy or mannerly, Where all things are at stake, divine and human. Phil. Faith, what you say is right. Stas. I'll tell you fairly. Your great man if I meet, I make way for him, Give him the wall, shew him respect, but where The belly is concern'd, I will not yield An inch,—unless he box me into breeding. To me a feast is an inheritance Without incumbrance. Phil. Ever bear in mind This maxim, Lesbonicus. The best policy Is to be perfect in all good;—if that We can't attain to, to be next to perfect. The match that I propose for your consent, Why will you not agree to?—What are riches?— The Gods alone are rich: to them alone Is wealth and pow'r:—but we poor mortal men, When that the soul, which is the salt of life, Keeping our bodies from corruption, leaves us, At Acheron shall be counted all alike, The beggar and the wealthiest. Stas. (To Phil.) I believe, Your wealth you'll carry with you, that, when dead, You may behave there as your name imports. Phil. That you may know it is not wealth we seek, But value your alliance, I do ask Your sister for my son without a portion. Success attend it!—Is't agreed?—Why silent? Stas. O ye immortal Gods, a rare proposal! Phil. Do but say, done. Stas. Why how now? when he could Get nothing by the bargain, he could say Done first; and now he's sure to win, he's silent. Les. That you esteem me worthy your alliance, I am most thankful; but although my folly Has cast me down thus low, I've yet a farm Near to the town here: this will I bestow Upon my sister for her portion; this Is all, through my imprudence and my folly That I have left me now besides my life. Phil. I want no portion. Les. I'm resolv'd to give it. Stas. Dear master, would you part then with our nurse, That feeds us? our support? think what you're doing. How shall we eat in future? Les. Hold your tongue. Am I accountable to you? Stas. We're ruin'd Past all redemption, if I don't invent Some flam.—I have it.—Philto, a word with you. Phil. What would you? Stas. Step aside this way a little. Phil. I will. (They retire.) Stas. The secret I shall now unfold Let not my master know, nor any other. Phil. Me you may safely trust. Stas. By Gods and men I do conjure you, let not this same farm Come into your possession, or your son's. The reason will I tell. Phil. I fain would hear it. Stas. First then, whene'er the land is plough'd, the oxen Ev'ry fifth furrow drop down dead. Phil. Fye on it! Stas. A passage down to Acheron's in our field. The grapes grow mouldy as they hang, before They can be gather'd. Les. He is, I suppose, Persuading him:—though he's an errant rogue, To me he's not unfaithful. Stas. Hear what follows. When that the harvest promises most fair, They gather in thrice less than what was sown. Phil. Nay!—then methinks it were a proper place For men to sow their wild oats, where they would not Spring up. Stas. There never was a person yet, That ever own'd this farm, but his affairs Did turn out bad:—some ran away, some died, Some hang'd themselves.—Why, there's my master now, To what sad straits is he reduc'd! Phil. O keep me Far from this farm! Stas. You'd have more cause to say so, Were you to hear the whole.—There's not a tree, But has been blasted with the lightning: more— The hogs are eat up with the mange; the sheep Pine with the rot, all scabby as this hand: And no man can live there six months together, No, not a Syrian, though they are most hardy, The Influenza is to all so fatal. Phil. I do believe it true: but the Campanians The Syrians far outgo in hardiness.— This farm is a fit spot, as you've described it, Wherein to place bad men: And as they tell us, That in those islands stil'd The Fortunate Assemble th'upright, and the virtuous livers, So should the wicked here be thrust together, Since 'tis of such a nature. Stas. 'Tis th'abode Of misery. But, without more words,—whatever Evil you'd search for, you might find it here. Phil. You may go seek it there, or where you will. Stas. Be cautious how you tell what I have told you. Phil. You've told it to no blabber. Stas. Now my master Would gladly part with it, could he but find A gudgeon to his purpose. Phil. I'll have none of it. Stas. If you are wise indeed, you will not have it. (Aside.) So—I have frighten'd this old hunks most rarely From taking of this farm: if that were gone, We've nothing to subsist on. Phil. Lesbonicus, I now return to you. Les. I prithee tell me, What has he said? Phil. Think you?—The fellow wants His liberty, but has not wherewithal To purchase it. Les. And I too would be rich, But cannot. Stas. (Aside.) Once you might have been, if then You had chose it; now you cannot, since you've nothing. Les. What was it you was muttering to yourself? Stas. Concerning what you said.—You had been rich, If it had been your pleasure heretofore; 'Tis now too late to wish it. Phil. For this portion, I can determine nothing; with my son You'll settle it, and to your liking.—Well then,— Your sister I request for him in marriage. Success attend it! What? still scrupulous! Les. Well, since you'll have it so, heav'ns blessing on it! I here betroth her to him. Phil. Never did A father joy more in a new-born son, Than I, when you brought forth that word, betroth. Stas. Heav'ns prosper this agreement! Phil. 'Tis my prayer. Les. Go, Stasimus, to my sister, and relate To Callicles this transaction. Stas. I'll be gone. Les. Congratulate my sister. Stas. To be sure! Phil. Go with me in, sir, where this compact we'll Confirm, and for the nuptials fix a day. Les. (to Stas.) Do as I bade you.—I'll be here this instant.— Tell Callicles to meet me.— Stas. Prithee go! Les. To fix the portion.— Stas. Go.— Lys. For I'm resolv'd A portion she shall have. Stas. Nay, pray be gone! Les. Nor will I suffer her to lose— Stas. Go, go!— Les. By my neglect.— Stas. Be gone now.— Les. 'Tis but just For my offences.— Stas. Will you not be gone? Les. That I alone should suffer.— Stas. Go—be gone. Les. My father! shall I never see you more? Stas. Go, get thee gone! be gone! be gone! be gone! [Exeunt Lesbonicus and Philto. SCENE V. STASIMUS alone. At length I have prevail'd on him to go. Ye gods! from wrongly we shall manage right, If we but keep this farm: and yet I have Some doubt concerning what will be the issue. If it be once made over to another, 'Tis over then with me: I must abroad, Carry a knapsack, helmet, sword, and target: He'll fly the city when the wedding's o'er, And will enlist him somewhere for a soldier, In Asia or Cilicia.—But I'll go, Where master bade me; though I hate this house, Ever since he, who bought it, turn'd us out. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter CALLICLES and STASIMUS. CALLICLES. How said you, Stasimus? that your master's son, Young Lesbonicus, had betroth'd his sister? Stas. The same. Cal. To whom? Stas. To Philto's son, Lysiteles, Without a portion. Cal. How? without a portion Married in so rich a family? What you say Is not to be believ'd. Stas. I cannot help Your incredulity: if this you don't Believe, I shall believe that— Cal. What? Stas. You hold me Of no account. Cal. Tell me, how long ago, And where was this transacted? Stas. Here,—before This very door,—now, at this very instant. Cal. Has Lesbonicus prov'd a better manager, Now that his fortune's shatter'd, than when whole? Stas. Nay, what is more, Sir, Philto came himself A suiter for his son. Cal. It were a shame To send the maiden dowerless: this concerns me: I'll strait to my corrector, and will ask His counsel. [Exit. SCENE II. STASIMUS alone. Aye, I smell it out, I guess, Why he does speed him thither: his intent is To get the farm too, as he got the house, From Lesbonicus. O my master Charmides! How has your absence your affairs distracted! Would I could see you safe return'd, to reck Due vengeance on your foes, and so reward me, As I have been, and am, your faithful slave. 'Tis very difficult to find a friend More than in name, to whom your near concerns Having entrusted, you may sleep at ease. But see—our son-in-law, Lysiteles, Comes this way with his neighbour Lesbonicus. Some difference, what I know not, is between them. They walk with hasty steps: one holds the other Fast by the cloak: and now they stop abruptly. I'll step aside here; for I long to listen The conversation of these neighbour-youths. [Retires to a distance. SCENE III. Enter LYSITELES and LESBONICUS. Lys. Stay prithee, don't oppose me, do not seek To hide thee from me. Les. Can't you let me go, Where I intend? Lys. I would, if it appear'd It were for your advantage, fame, or honour. Les. Indeed, you do it with such ease. Lys. Do what? Les. You give your friend offence. Lys. That's far from me; And such behaviour I am yet to learn. Les. How learn'd without a master! What would you Have done, had you been school'd, to plague me more? While kindness you pretend, you do me wrong. Lys. I? Les. You. Lys. How do you wrong? Les. In doing that Displeases me. Lys. I mean it for your good. Lesb. Are Les. Are you then friendlier to me, than myself Am to myself? I understand sufficiently, And for myself can spy out my advantage. Lys. Is this a proof of understanding in you, To slight a proffer'd benefit from one, Who's your well-wisher? Les. Nothing can I deem A benefit, if it displeases him On whom it is bestow'd. I know my duty: Yet all that you can utter will not shield me From men's report. Lys. How say you? (for I can No longer be with-held from talking to you, As you deserve,) the reputation, which Your fore-fathers to you deliver'd down, Was it for this, that what their virtue got, You by excess should lose? Your father, grandfather, Had oped for you a plain and easy road, To lead you to renown: you've made it hard Through vice, and indolence, and shameless manners. Love you have chose, your love you have prefer'd Before your honour: and can this, believe you, Cover your faults? ah! no, it is not so. Take virtue to your mind, be indolence Expell'd thence: in the Forum dedicate Your service to your friends, and not in bed To a she-friend, a mistress, as you're wont. Moreover, I most earnestly entreat you Not to relinquish this same farm, but keep it For your support, that those who are your enemies May not reproach you with extremest want. Les. All you have said I know, could sign and seal to,— That I have wasted my inheritance, Tarnish'd the glory of my ancestors;— Knew how I should have acted, but alas! I could not do it; by the pow'r of love Subdued, by idleness held captive, readily I fell into the snare. And now to you, As you deserve, I owe my utmost thanks. Lys. I cannot bear to lose my labour thus;— That you should slight my counsels! and it grieves me, You have so little shame.—In fine, except You list to me, and act as I advise, Screen'd as it were by folly you'll lie hid, That honour cannot find you: base obscurity Will shrowd your brightness, which should blaze abroad, The fashion of your mind full well I know, How uninform'd:—I know, that you have err'd Not of yourself, nor of your own accord, But Love has blinded you;—and all his ways To me are manifest.—It is with Love, As with a stone whirl'd from a sling;—it flies, Nothing so quick.—Love makes a man a fool, Hard to be pleas'd.—What you'd persuade him to, He likes not, and embraces that, from which You would dissuade him.—What there is a lack of, That will he covet;—when 'tis in his power, He'll none on't.—Whoso bids him to avoid A thing, invites him to it; interdicts, Who recommends it.—'Tis the height of madness, Ever to take up your abode with Love.— But I advise you,—think and think again, How you should act: for if you still go on So as you seem to promise, you'll at once Destroy the reputation of your house: You'll set it, as it were, on fire; and then Will you want water, to extinguish it; Which when you've got, (as is the way of lovers, They are so wondrous cunning,) you'll not leave A single spark to light it up again. Les. That's easy to be found; and if you ask it, Your very enemy will give you fire.— But, while you rate me for my misdemeanours, Yourself would urge me to a viler course.— My sister you would have, and would persuade me Without a portion to bestow her: but It is not fit, that I, who have run out So large a patrimony, should be rich, And own a farm, while want is all her portion; So should I justly be her scorn and hatred. Who bears him gently to his own relations, Will ne'er shew hard to others.—As I've said, I'll do,—no longer then oppose me in it. Lys. And is it better you should suffer want By reason of your sister, and that I Should have the farm rather than you, wherewith You might repair your shatter'd fortune? Les. No, My poverty ne'er think on; let me be Distrest, not infamous; nor let them say, That in bestowing her without a portion I gave her into keeping, not in marriage. I should be held a rascal, no one greater; And such report would give a grace to you, But sully me, if portionless you took her:— You would gain honour, I should meet reproach. Lys. By giving me the farm, you'd fain be stil'd A Man of Honour! Les. 'Tis not in my thoughts: This, this is honour to an honest man, For ever to be mindful of his duty. Les. In sooth I know the purpose of your heart; I see it all, I scent it, I perceive it. Soon as the bond of near affinity Is knit betwixt us,—when you've given the farm, And nothing left you here for your support,— The marriage ended,—strait you'll fly the city A needy wanderer, desert your country, Relations, friends; and they will say, my avarice Had frighted you away: then think not, I Shall suffer it. Stas. (advancing) I can't help crying out, Bravo! bravo! Lysiteles, encore! You've won the prize with ease; your play's the best; The subject better manag'd, and the lines Are better.—How then? (to Lesb.) Are you such an oaf Still to dispute it?—Think you of the fine. Les. Who bid you meddle, and what brought you hither, To join our councils? Stas. That which brought me hither Shall carry me away. (retires.) Les. Come with me home, Lysiteles, where we will talk together More of these matters. Lys. Nothing am I wont To do in private, I'll now speak my mind.— If, as I think you ought, you'll give your sister In marriage to me, and without a portion, Nor you yourself will after go abroad, What's mine is yours.—But if you're other minded, All good betide you!—On no other terms I'll hold you for a friend.—So I'm resolv'd. [Exit Lysiteles; and Lesbonicus goes off directly after. SCENE IV. STASIMUS alone. He's gone.—D'ye hear, Lysiteles?—I want you.— My master, he is gone too.—Stasimus, thou Art left alone then.—What now shall I do?— Why, strap my knapsack tight together, fit My buckler to my back, order my shoes To be new soal'd:—we cannot stay.—I see, That I must shortly be a soldier's skip: My master for support will throw himself Into the service of some prince or other. Faith he will prove himself the best of warriors.— In a retreat;—he'll fall an easy prey, To any one who chances to oppose him. For me,—when with a bow I'm strongly arm'd, A quiver stuck with arrows, on my head An helmet,—in the tent I'll sleep at ease. Now will I to the Forum, and demand The talent, which I lent six days ago; That with me I may have something withal To bear my travelling charges on the way. [Exit. SCENE V. Enter MEGARONIDES and CALLICLES. MEGARONIDES. As you relate th'affair, it cannot be By any means, but that a portion must Be given with the maid. Cal. It cannot be Right honest in me sure to let her wed Without a portion, when I've wherewithal At home in my possession for that purpose. Meg. You have a portion, true;—unless you chuse To wait, 'till she's dispos'd of by her brother In marriage without dower: then yourself May go to Philto, tell him that you'll give A portion, that you do't by reason of Your friendship with her father. Yet I fear This very proffer might perhaps involve you In foul report and scandal with the people: That you were friendly to the girl, they'd say, Was not without a reason, and the dower, They will pretend, was giv'n you by her father, To give to her; with that you were so generous. Nor even that, would they believe, that you Had giv'n her whole, and nothing had substracted. Now, if the coming you would wait of Charmides; The time is very long, and all the while No portion to the man that marries her. Cal. In troth all this has come into my mind. Meg. Think you 'twould be more useful to our purpose, For me to go to Lesbonicus, and Inform him of the matter? Cal. How? discover The treasure to a wild young spark, brimful Of love and wantonness? No, by no means: For I do know for certain, he could eat up That, and the very place too, where 'tis hid; Where I'm afraid to dig, lest he should hear The sound, and at a word spoke of the portion Smell out the very thing. Meg. What's to be done then? Cal. The treasure may be dug up privately, When opportunity is found: mean while I'll borrow somewhere of some friend or other What money's needful. Meg. Can you any where Prevail upon a friend to lend it? Cal. Surely. Meg. No, no,—you'll find they have an answer ready: “Indeed I have it not, I cannot lend it.” Cal. Were they sincere in this, I'd rather hear it, Than have their money. Meg. Hold—I have a thought;— See, if it likes you. Cal. What's your thought? Meg. A brave one, At least in my opinion. Cal. Say, what is it? Meg. Let there be forthwith hired, as soon as can be, Some man to personate a stranger. Cal. What Is he to do then? Meg. Let his dress be shap'd Exactly to the foreign mode; his face Unknown, an impudent and lying knave. Cal. What after? Meg. To our spark then let him come As from his father, from Seleucia; Salute him in the old man's name, acquaint him, That he is well, and purpos'd to return Forthwith: two letters he must likewise bring, Which we will forge, as coming from the father; One for the son, the other, he must say, To you he would deliver. Cal. Well,—go on. Meg. Moreover, from the father let him say He has brought money for the maiden's portion, Which he has orders to deliver you.— Do you conceive me now? Cal. Most thoroughly, And hear with pleasure. Meg. You will give the youth This money, when the maid shall be dispos'd In marriage. Cal. A most admirable thought! Meg. By this, when you have dug the treasure up, You will remove suspicion from the youth, Who'll think the money brought you from his father: You'll take it from the treasure. Cal. Very good:— Though at these years I am asham'd to play A double part.—But hold—When he shall bring The letters seal'd, for seal'd they must be brought, Do you not think, the spark's acquainted with Th'impression of his father's ring? Meg. No more: You'll find an hundred reasons:—he has lost That which he us'd to have, and got a new one:— What if indeed they were not seal'd at all, This might be said, that they were open'd, and Inspected at the Customs.—But in troth To wear the day in prating of this business, Is merely idleness, and waste of time:— Though we could spin our talk out ere so long. Go to the treasure privily,—remove Your servants, men and maids,—and hearkye— Cal. What? Meg. See, you conceal it even from your wife:— For there is nothing she can keep a secret. Why do you stand? why do you loiter now? Why don't you hence? Dig, open, and draw forth What sum's sufficient for the purpose, then Close up again;—but do it privily, As I directed:—turn out all your people. Cal. I'll do so. Meg. But we talk too long: the day Is wasting, while there's need of haste. Believe me, You've nought to fear about the seal: th'excuse I mention'd is a rare one,—that they were Inspected at the customs. And besides Do you not see the time of day? What think you One of his nature, of his disposition, Can be about? he has been drunk long since. He will agree to what you please: and then, What makes most for us, he that we shall hire Will bring, not ask for money. Cal. I am satisfied. Meg. I'll to the Forum, hire a Counterfeit, And send him with two letters to the youth Fully instructed. Cal. I then will go in, And strait about the business. You'll take care Of your's. Meg. It shall be done, or I'm a fool else. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter CHARMIDES. To the high ruler of the sea, Jove's brother, And to his Thetis, I give praise and thanks With joy and gratitude; to the salt floods, That having in their pow'r my life, my all, From their dread realms restor'd me to my country. To you, great Neptune, above other Gods, I pay my utmost thanks.—Men call you cruel, Rude, and severe, of greedy disposition, Blood-thirsty, fierce, unsufferable, outragious: But I have prov'd you other; in the deep I found you of an easy clement nature, And mild as I could wish.—I've heard before This commendation of you, and from great ones, That you were wont to spare the indigent, And crush the wealthy.—I applaud your justice In treating men according to their merits.— 'Tis worthy of the Gods to have respect Unto the poor.—I know you may be trusted, Though they proclaim you treacherous: for without Your aid your wild attendants in the deep Had maul'd me sorely, scatter'd all I have, All mine, and me too, through the azure plains. Fierce hurricanes beset the ship, like dogs: Rain, winds, and waves had broke the masts and yards, And split the sails, if with propitious peace You had not been at hand.—Away then, I'm Resolv'd henceforth to give me up to ease.— I've got enough.—O with what troubles have I Struggled, in seeking riches for my son? But who is this, that's entering now our street?— A stranger in appearance, and in dress.— Well,—though I needs must long to be at home, I'll wait awhile, and see what he's about. SCENE II. Enter THE COUNTERFEIT at a distance. I'll name this day the Festival of Three Pieces, On which I've let my art out for that sum. Here I am, from Seleucia just arriv'd, Arabia, Asia, Macedon,—which I never Saw with my eyes, nor ever once set foot on.— Behold, what troubles will not poverty Bring on a needy wretch!—For those three pieces Am I compell'd to say, that I receiv'd These letters from a man, of whom I'm ignorant, Who he may be; nor do I know indeed, If such an one was ever born. Charm. In troth This fellow's like a mushroom: he's all head.— His countenance bespeaks him an Illyrian, His garb too of that country. Count. He, who hired me, Brought me home with him, told me what he wanted, Gave me instructions how and what to do: If of my own head I should throw in more, Our plot will thrive the better.—I'm apparel'd, As he would have me:—Money 'tis, that does it:— My garb he hired from the Play-house.—Now If my disguise succeed, I'll prove myself No common cheat. Charm. The more I see his looks, The less I like them.—He's some night-adventurer, Or cut-purse surely.—How he looks about him, How he surveys the place, and of my house Takes special note!—Why sure he marks the place, To come and rob it by and bye.—'Twere best To watch him close what he's about:—I'll do so. Count. This is the spot my hirer pointed out, And this the house, where I'm to play my part. I'll knock then at the door. Charm. The fellow makes Directly to my house.—Egad, I fancy I must keep watch to-night, though just arriv'd. Count. Open the door there—Open—Where's the porter? Charm. What do you want, young man?—Why knock you here? Count. Prithee, old grey-beard, I have giv'n account Already, when examin'd at the Customs.— I want a young man,—somewhere hereabout He dwells,—one Lesbonicus,—and another With a white pate as yours is;—he, from whom I had these letters, said his name was Callicles. Charm. (Aside) 'Tis Lesbonicus my own son he seeks, And Callicles my friend too, in whose charge I left my means and children.— Count. If you know, Most rev'rend Sire, inform me where they dwell. Charm. Why do you want to find them out?—Who are you? Whence are you? where d'you come from? Count. Hey!—You ask So many questions in a breath, I know not Which to resolve you first: but if you'll put them Gently and singly, one by one, my name I'll tell, and wherefore I have journey'd hither. Charm. Well,—as you please. Come,—tell me first your name. Count. You ask an arduous task. Charm. Why so? Count. Because, Should you set out, before the day began, With the first part and foremost of my name, The night would go to bed ere you had reach'd The hindmost of it. Charm. He had need of torches And of provisions, whoso undertakes To journey through it. Count. I've another name though; A tiny one,—no bigger than an hogshead. Charm. This is a rogue in grain!—But hearkye— Count. What? Charm. What want you with those persons you enquire for? Count. The father of the young man Lesbonicus Gave me these letters.—He's my friend. Charm. (Aside) I have him,— He's taken in the manner.—He pretends, Myself did give him letters.—I will have Rare fun with him. Count. Attend, and I'll proceed. Charm. I am attentive. Count. He commission'd me To give one letter to young Lesbonicus, His son, the other to his friend, to Callicles. Charm. A pretty joke, i'faith!—I'll keep it up.— Where was he? Count. He has manag'd matters well. Charm. Where? Count. In Seleucia. Charm. You had letters of him? Count. With his own hands he gave them into mine. Charm. What sort of man? Count. He's taller than yourself By half a foot. Charm. (Aside) Faith, he has gravel'd me, To find that I was taller when away, Than now I'm here.—You knew him, did you not? Count. Knew him? A foolish question!—We were us'd To mess together. Charm. Say then, what name bore he? Count. A fair one verily. Charm. I'd hear his name. Count. (Hesitating) It's—it's—ah me!—his name is. Charm. What's the matter? Count. I've swallow'd it this instant unawares. Charm. How? swallow'd, say you? troth, I like him not, Who holds his friends inclos'd within his teeth. Count. I had it at my tongue's end but just now. Charm. (Aside) 'Twas opportune my coming here to day Before this rascal. Count. (Aside) I am caught most plainly. Charm. Have you yet found the name? Count. 'Fore Gods and men I own myself abash'd. Charm. Behold, how much You knew him! Count. As myself.—It happens oft, That what we hold in hand, and have in sight, We look for as if lost.—I'll recollect it Letter by letter.—It begins with C. Charm. Is it Callicias? Count. No. Charm. Callippus? Count. No. Charm. Is't Callidemides? Count. No. Charm. Callinicus? Count. No. Charm. Is't Callimarchus? Count. 'Tis in vain to seek it, Nor do I heed it much, so my own name I don't forget. Charm. But there are many here Call'd Lesbonicus; and, unless you tell The father's name, I cannot shew them to you, Whom you enquire for,—What is't like?—We'll try, If we can hit upon it by conjecture. Count. 'Tis like Char. Charm. Is it Chares? Charidemus? Or Charmides? Count. Oh, that.—The Gods confound him! Charm. 'Tis fitter you should bless a friend than curse him. Count. A worthless fellow, to have lain perdue thus Within my lips and teeth. Charm. You should not speak Ill of an absent friend. Count. Why did the knave Then hide him from me? Charm. He had answer'd, had you But call'd him by his name.—Where is he now? Count. Truly I left him last at Rhadamanth In the Cecropian Island. Charm. (Aside) Can there be A greater simpleton than I, to ask Where I myself am? But no matter.—Tell me,— Count. What? Charm. Let me ask, what places have you been at? Count. Most wondrous ones. Charm. I should be glad to hear, If 'tis not too much trouble. Count. I'm impatient To give you an account.—Then first of all, We came to Araby in Pontus. Charm. How? Is Araby in Pontus? Count. Yes, it is; But not that Araby, where frankincense Is grown, but where sweet-marjoram, and wormwood. Charm. (Aside) 'Tis the completest knave!—More fool am I though, To ask him whence I came, (which I must know, He cannot,) but that I've a mind to try, How he'll get off at last.—What is your name, Young man? Count. 'Tis Touchit;—that, Sir, is my name, A common one. Charm. A very knavish name; As though you meant to say, if any thing Was trusted to you, touch it, and 'tis gone.— But hearkye,—whither did you further travel? Count. Attend, and I'll relate. We journey'd on To the river's head that rises out of heaven Beneath the throne of Jove. Charm. The throne of Jove? Count. I say it. Charm. Out of heav'n? Count. Aye, from the midst on't. Charm. How! you ascended up to heav'n? Count. We did; In a small cock-boat were we carried thither Against the stream. Charm. Oh ho!—And saw you Jove? Count. The other Gods inform'd us he was gone Unto his villa to dispense provisions Among his slaves.—Moreover— Charm. Pshaw! moreover I want to hear no more. Count. Nay, I have done, If you are tired. Charm. How shameless! who pretends, That he has mounted up from earth to heaven. Count. I'll let you go then, since I see you chuse it:— But shew me where they live whom I enquire for, Where I may bear these letters. Charm. Hearkye now, If haply you should see this Charmides, The same that you pretend gave you those letters, Say, should you know him? Count. Think you I'm a beast, As not to know a man I've past my life with? Or, can you think, would he be such an oaf, To trust me with a thousand Philippeans, Enjoining me to bear them to his son And Callicles his friend, to whom, he told me, He had consign'd the charge of his affairs? Would he, I say, have trusted me, except We had been well acquainted with each other? Charm. (Aside) Now would I trick this trickster,—if I could But cozen him of those thousand Philippeans, He said I gave him! though I know him not, Nor ever saw him till this day.—What, I Trust him with gold? who would not even give A dump of lead to save him from an hanging.— I must go cunningly to work.—Hoa, Touchit, Three words with you. Count. Three hundred, if you please. Charm. Have you the money you receiv'd of Charmides? Count. In Philippeans, told upon the nail, A thousand pieces. Charm. You receiv'd them, did you, Of Charmides himself? Count. It had been wondrous, Had I receiv'd them of his grandsire truly, Or his great-grandsire,—who are dead. Charm. Young man, Prithee give me the gold. Count. Give you what gold? Charm. That which you own'd you did receive of me. Count. Receiv'd of you? Charm. I say it. Count. Who are you? Charm. Who gave to you the thousand pieces:-I Am Charmides. Count. You're not, nor ever shall be, I mean, the master of this gold.—Away,— You are a knowing one!—you'd take me in!— But I too am a knowing one. Charm. I'm Charmides. Count. You may be, but in vain.—I bring no money. You've crept upon me in the very nick Most slily. When I said I had brought gold, You then was Charmides; before you was not, Till I made mention of the gold.—'Twon't do.— So prithee, as you've taken up the name Of Charmides, e'en lay it down again. Charm. Who am I, if I am not that I am? Count. What's that to me? Be whom you please, you're welcome, So you are not the person I'd not have you. Before, you was not who you was; and now, You are who then you was not. Charm. Come, dispatch. Count. How? what dispatch? Charm. Give me the money. Count. Sure You dream, old gentleman. Charm. Did you not own, That Charmides had giv'n it you? Count. I did,— In writing,—not in specie. Charm. Prithee hence, And leave the place this instant, ere I order you An hearty drubbing. Count. Why? Charm. Because myself Am that same Charmides that you've invented;— Who you pretend has giv'n you letters. Count. How! I pray you, are you he? Charm. Yes, I am he. Count. What say you? are you he? Charm. I am, I say. Count. Himself? Charm. I say, I'm Charmides,—himself. Count. And are you he himself? Charm. His very self.— Out of my sight;—Be gone then. Count. Now, because Your coming was so late, I'll have you beaten At the new Ædiles' and my own award. Charm. What! you abuse me? Count. All the gods confound you For your arrival! I had little car'd, If you had perish'd first.—I've got at least The money for my trouble.—Ill betide you! And now, or who you are, or who you are not, I value not a straw.—To him I'll go, Who hir'd me for three pieces, and acquaint him, How that his money's thrown away.—I'm gone.— Farewell?—Fare ill!—May all the gods confound you, For coming from abroad,—you, master Charmides! [Exit. SCENE III. CHARMIDES alone. Now he is gone, I've opportunity And time more freely to debate this matter.— I am perplex'd, I'm stung at heart, to think What business he could have now at my door.— Those letters that he talk'd of fill my mind With apprehensions;—and those thousand pieces, What could he mean by them?—The bell doth never Clink of itself: unhandled, and unmov'd, 'Tis dumb.—But who is this, that down the street Comes running hither?—I've a mind to watch What he's about.—I'll step aside. [Retires. SCENE IV. Enter STASIMUS running, at a distance. Stas. (to himself) Run, Stasimus, Be quick, and hie thee with what speed thou canst Home to thy master, or thy sluggard folly Will make thy shoulders shrug for fear.—Then haste thee, Quicken thy pace;—thou hast been gone from home A long while.—Have a care then, that the lash Smack not upon thee, if thou should'st be absent, When that thy master make for thee enquiry.— Run, run then without ceasing.—(Stopping) Hold thee,—Stasimus, What a sad fellow art thou, to forget Thy ring, and leave it at the tippling-house, Where thou hadst warm'd thy gullet?—Back again, And ask for't ere too late.— Charm. Whoe'er he be, He skips and frisks about, as if an horse-fly Had him to break, and taught him the menage. Stas. Art not asham'd, to lose thy memory In drinking but three pottles?—or didst think The men thou drank'st with were such honest souls, They'd keep their hands from picking. There was Theruchus, Cerconicus, Crinnus, Cercobulus, Collabus, A race of broken-shin'd and black-eyed bruisers, Knights of the chain, and squires o'th'whipping-post. And canst thou hope then from among such fellows To get thy ring, when one of them did steal A racer's shoe off in his utmost speed? Charm. 'Fore heav'n, a finish'd thief! Stas. What's best to do? Shall I, in seeking what is gone for ever, Add loss of labour too?—What's gone, is gone.— Then tack about, and hie thee to thy master. Charm. This is no run-away rogue, that having stray'd Forgets to find his way home. Stas. Would to heav'n, That the old manners, and the ancient thrift, Were held in greater honour now-a-days Than the base fashion of our times. Charm. Good heavens! How gravely and how solemnly he talks! The old, the old he praises, he is all For the old manners. Stas. Modern uses teach us To do what best we like, not what is best. Ambition is by custom sanctified, Freed from the law's restraint:—To throw away One's shield, and turn one's back upon the foe, Is licens'd by our manners: to make vice The ready road to honour, is the practice. Charm. O villainous manners! Stas. To neglect the brave, And pass them by unheeded, is the custom. Charm. 'Tis infamous! Stas. These manners have o'erpower'd The laws themselves, and hold them in submission With more authority than children now Are us'd to sway their parents. The poor statutes With iron nails are fix'd against the walls: But it were fitter our degenerate manners Were stuck up in their stead. Charm. I have a mind To join, and enter into talk with him, I hear him with such pleasure: but I fear, If I address him, the discourse he'll turn To other matters. Stas. Nothing now requires The sanction of the laws; for these are bent In pliable subjection to our manners, Which in their wild career destroy, confound All sacred and all public rights. Charm. A mischief Light on these manners! Stas. Does not this require The reprehension of the public state? For men of such a stamp, such evil habits, Are universal enemies to all; They injure the whole people, while they break Through faith and honesty; nay, they destroy All confidence in those, who nothing merit it, By rend'ring them suspected like themselves: For 'twill be thought that others dispositions Resemble theirs.—Now, as for these reflections, How they have chanc'd to come into my mind, A certain matter that of late concern'd me Prompted me with them.—What you lend, is lost; And when you ask it of your friend again, You make that friend your enemy by your kindness. Still would you press him further, of two things You have the choice, either to lose your loan, Or lose your friend. Charm. Why surely this is Stasimus, My fellow. Stas. For example,—with the talent I lent a friend, what did I? why, I bought Myself an enemy, and sold a friend.— But I'm a fool to busy thus my brain About the public, rather than take heed To that which most concerns myself, contrive How to secure my back.—I'll go me home. (Going.) Charm. Hola, you,—stop,—hola,—d'ye hear me?—stop. Stas. Stop?—I'll not stop. Charm. But prithee— Stas. What if I Dislike your prithee? Charm. How now?—Stasimus, You are too saucy. Stas. You had better buy One that will mind your bidding. Charm. I have bought, And paid for one; but if he heed me not, What should I do? Stas. Belabour him most heartily. Charm. Your counsel's right, and I'm resolv'd to do so. Stas. Except, indeed, that you are bounden to him For his good services. Charm. If you are good then, I'll hold me bounden to you; but if otherwise, I'll do as you direct. Stas. What is't to me, Whether your slaves are good or bad? Charm. Because You have a share in't,—in the good or bad. Stas. As to the one, I give it to you all: The other (that's the good) place all to me. Charm. I shall, if you deserve it.—Turn your head, And look upon me: I am Charmides. Stas. Ha! who makes mention of that best of mortals? Charm. That best of mortals, he himself,—'tis I. Stas. (turning) O sea! O earth! O heav'n! O all ye Gods! Have I my eye-sight clear? and is it he? Or is it not?—'Tis he!—'tis he, for certain!— 'Tis he indeed!—O my most wish'd-for master, Save you— Charm. And you too, Stasimus. Stas. That you're safe— Charm. (interrupting) I know what you would say, and do believe you. Wave other points: resolve me but in this: How do my children do, whom here I left, My son and daughter? Stas. They're alive, and well. Charm. Both, say you? Stas. Both. Charm. Gods! 'twas your gracious will To save me for them.—What I more would know, I at my leisure will enquire within.— Let's enter.—Follow. (Advancing to his house) Stas. Whither are you going? Charm. Whither but home? Stas. You think then we live here? Charm. Where else can I imagine? Stas. Now— Charm. What now? Stas. This house—is none of our's. Charm. What's that you say? Stas. Your son has sold it,— Charm. Ruin'd! Stas. For the ready, Paid on the spot. Charm. For how much? Stas. Forty Minæ. Cham. Undone!—Who bought it? Stas. Callicles, to whom, While absent, your affairs you trusted: hither Has he remov'd, and now abides here; us He has turn'd out of doors. Charm. Where lives my son? Stas. Here in this back part. Charm. Utterly undone! Stas. I thought 'twould grieve you, when you came to hear it. Charm. What dangers have I past! borne, hapless wretch, Through oceans vast, to pirates numberless Expos'd, with hazard of my life!—At length Preserv'd, return'd in safety, I am lost, Here perish, and through those, for whom alone, Old as I am, I struggled with misfortunes.— I'm sick at heart with grief.—Support me, Stasimus! Stas. Shall I fetch water? Char. When my property,— When oh! that sicken'd, then you should have pour'd Your water on it, ere 'twas past recovery. SCENE V. Enter CALLICLES. Cal. What noise is this I hear before the door? Charm. O Callicles! O Callicles! to whom Have I intrusted my affairs? ah me! To what a friend? Cal. An honest and a faithful, A trusty one, of strict fidelity.— I am rejoic'd to see you here return'd In safety. Charm. I believe it all, if so You prove yourself as you pretend you are.— But wherefore thus accoutred? Cal. I'll inform you. I have been digging up your treasure here, To portion out your daughter.—But within More fully I'll unfold to you both this, And other matters. Come along. Charm. Here,—Stasimus! Stas. Sir! Charm. Run with speed unto the haven;—make One running of it;—there you'll find the ship, That brought me hither: bid Sangario see The goods unladen, which I order'd;—go then,— The impost I have paid. Stas. I'll make dispatch. Charm. Go, get you gone;—be back with speed. Stas. I'm there, And here too, in a twinkling. Cal. Will you please To enter with me?—Come now. Charm. I attend you. [Exeunt Callicles and Charmides. SCENE VI. STASIMUS alone. This is my master's friend! the only one, That has stuck firmly to him! he, good man, Has lov'd him with unchangeable affection! Oh, he's the only one, I dare be sworn, That's faithful to him!—Aye,—he has a view To serve himself in serving of my master. [Exit. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter LYSITELES. I am the first of men, surpassing all In pleasure and in joy, so happily Does every thing befall me, that I wish: Still one success is followed by another In all I do, and transport seconds transport. Young Lesbonicus' servant, Stasimus, Met me just now, and told me, Charmides His master was return'd here from abroad. 'Tis proper I should meet him with all speed, That so the compact 'twixt his son and me May by the father's sanction be confirm'd. I'll go.—But hark, the door I hear is opening:— This hindrance now is most unseasonable. (Retires at a distance. SCENE II. Enter CHARMIDES and CALLICLES. Charm. I cannot think there is a man on earth, Or ever was a man, or ever will be, Whose faith and honest firmness to his friend Can equal thine: had it not been for thee, He had unhous'd me of my house and home. Cal. If I have serv'd my friend in any thing, Or acted tow'rds him with fidelity, I scarce can seem to merit any praise, But think, I only have avoided blame. Whatever we confer upon a friend To have and hold for ever, is his own; But what is only lent him for a time, May be demanded back again at pleasure. Charm. 'Tis as you say.—But now, my honest friend, I cannot enough wonder, that my son Should have betroth'd his sister in a family So wealthy as Lysiteles' Philto's heir. Lys. (Behind) My name he mentions. Charm. By my troth, the girl Has got into the best of families. Lys. Why not address me to them?—Yet 'tis better To wait awhile; for the discourse concerns me. Charm. Ah! Cal. What's the matter? Charm. I forgot indeed To tell you, while we were within.—Just now, On my arrival here, a certain knave Accosted me, a very knave in grain. He told me, he had brought a thousand pieces For you and Lesbonicus, of my giving;— Though who he is, I know not, nor did ever See him before.—But wherefore do you laugh? Cal. He came by my direction, as from you Bringing me sums of gold, for me to give In dowry with your daughter; so your son On the receipt might think it came from you; Lest knowing of the truth, and that the treasure Was lodg'd in my possession, by our laws He might demand it as his patrimony. Charm. A rare conceit! Cal. Good Megaronides, Our common friend, devis'd it. Charm. I approve, Applaud his counsel. Lys. Wherefore do I stand, Fool that I am, alone here, and afraid To interrupt them in their conservation? Why not about the business I purposed?— I will accost them. (Advances. Charm. Look you,—who is this Coming towards us here? Lys. (Going up) Lysiteles Salutes his father-in-law, good Charmides. Charm. Heav'n grant you all you wish! Cal. And am not I Worth a salute? Lys. Yes, save you, Callicles!— But I must give him preference.—My coat, Dear Sir, is nearer to me than my cloke. Cal. Heav'n prosper you in all that you design! Charm. My daughter is, I hear, betroth'd to you. Lys. If you object not. Charm. No, by no means I. Lys. Your daughter you betroth to me for wife then? Charm. I do betroth her, and will give withal A thousand Philippeans for her portion. Lys. The portion I regard not. Charm. If you like The maiden, you must like the portion too: In short, you will not have the wife you want, Except you take the portion which you want not. Cal. He asks but justice. Lys. And he shall prevail, Since you're his advocate, and judge betwixt us. On this condition then you do engage To give your daughter to me for a wife? Charm. I do engage. Cal. I'll answer for it too. Lys. Dear kinsmen, health and happiness attend you! Charm. O Callicles! and yet there is a point, In which I've reason to be angry with you. Cal. What have I done? Charm. My son!—you've suffer'd him To be debauch'd. Cal. If wilfully 'twere done, With my consent, you would have cause indeed To be most angry with me.—But I pray you, Let me obtain from you this one request, Which I intreat. Charm. What is it? Cal. You shall know. Whatever he has done imprudently, Forget it all.—Why do you shake your head? Charm. I'm sorely vex'd at heart; and O! I fear— Cal. What do you mean? Charm. I'm vex'd that he should prove Such as I would not have him,—and I fear, Should I deny you your request, you'd think I bore me slightingly towards you.—Come, I'll not stand out, but do as you desire. Cal. Now thou'rt a right good fellow:—I will go, And call him forth. Charm. 'Tis hard you will not let me Take vengeance on him, such as he deserves. Cal. Open the door there,—open quick,—call forth Young Lesbonicus, if he be at home.— The cause is sudden, wherefore I require His presence here this instant. SCENE III. Enter LESBONICUS. Les. Who is it, With boisterous voice calls on me to come forth With speed here? Cal. A well-wisher, and a friend. Les. Tell me, is any thing amiss? Cal.
