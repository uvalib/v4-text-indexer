      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. The Divell is an Asse. That is, to day, The name of what you are met for, a new Play. Yet, Grandee's, would you were not come to grace Our matter, with allowing vs no place. Though you presume Satan a subtill thing, And may haue heard hee's worne in a thumbe-ring; Doe not on these presumptions, force vs act, In compasse of a cheese-trencher. This tract Will ne'er admit our vice, because of yours. Anone, who, worse then you, the fault endures That your selues make? when you will thrust and spurne, And knocke vs o'the elbowes, and bid, turne; As if, when wee had spoke, wee must be gone, Or, till wee speake, must all runne in, to one, Like the young adders, at the old ones mouth? Would wee could stand due North; or had no South, If that offend; or were Muscouy glasse, That you might looke our Scenes through as they passe, We know not how to affect you. If you'll come To see new Playes, pray you affoord vs roome, And shew this, but the same face you haue done Your deare delight, the Diuell of Edmunton. Or, if, for want of roome it must mis-carry, 'Twill be but Iustice, that your censure tarry, Till you giue some. And when sixe times you ha' seen't, If this Play doe not like, the Diuell is in't.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. Scene. I. Divell. Pvg. Iniqvity. [Sat.] Hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, &amp;c. To earth? and, why to earth, thou foolish Spirit? What wold'st thou do on earth? Pvg. For that, great Chiefe! As time shal work. I do but ask my mon'th. Which euery petty pui'nee Diuell has; Within that terme, the Court of Hell will heare Some thing, may gaine a longer grant, perhaps. Sat. For what? the laming a poore Cow, or two? Entring a Sow, to make her cast her farrow? Or crossing of a Mercat-womans Mare, Twixt this, and Totnam? these were wont to be Your maine atchieuements, Pug, You haue some plot, now, Vpon a tonning of Ale, to stale the yest, Or keepe the churne so, that the butter come not; Spight o'the housewiues cord, or her hot spit? Or some good Ribibe, about Kentish Towne, Or Hogsden, you would hang now, for a witch, Because shee will not let you play round Robbin: And you'll goe sowre the Citizens Creame 'gainst Sunday? That she may be accus'd for't, and condemn'd, By a Middlesex Iury, to the satisfaction Of their offended friends, the Londiners wiues Whose teeth were set on edge with it? Foolish feind, Stay I' your place, know your owne strengths, and put not Beyond the spheare of your actiuity. You are too dull a Diuell to be trusted Forth in those parts, Pug, vpon any affayre That may concerne our name, on earth. It is not Euery ones worke. The state of Hell must care Whom it imployes, in point of reputation, Heere about London. You would make, I thinke An Agent, to be sent, for Lancashire, Proper inough; or some parts of Northumberland, So yo' had good instructions, Pug. Pvg. O Chiefe! You doe not know, deare Chiefe, what there is in mee. Proue me but for a fortnight, for a weeke, And lend mee but a Vice, to carry with mee, To practice there-with any play-fellow, And, you will see, there will come more vpon't, Then you'll imagine, pretious Chiefe. Sat. What Vice? What kind wouldst th'haue it of? Pvg. Why, any Fraud; Or Couetousnesse; or Lady Vanity; Or old Iniquity: I'll call him hither. Ini. What is he, calls vpon me, and would seeme to lack a Vice? Ere his words be halfe spoken, I am with him in a trice; Here, there, and euery where, as the Cat is with the mice: True vetus Iniquitas. Lack'st thou Cards, friend, or Dice? I will teach thee cheate, Child, to cog, lye, and swagger, And euer and anon, to be drawing forth thy dagger: To sweare by Gogs-nownes, like a lusty Inuentus, In a cloake to thy heele, and a hat like a pent-house. Thy breeches of three fingers, and thy doublet all belly, With a Wench that shall feede thee, with cock-stones and gelly. Pvg. Is it not excellent, Chiefe? how nimble he is! Ini. Child of hell, this is nothing! I will fetch thee a leape From the top of Pauls-steeple, to the Standard in Cheepe: And lead thee a daunce, through the streets without faile, Like a needle of Spaine, with a thred at my tayle. We will suruay the Suburbs, and make forth our sallyes, Downe Petticoate-lane, and vp the Smock-allies, To Shoreditch, Whitechappell, and so to Saint Kathernes. To drinke with the Dutch there, and take forth their patternes: From thence, wee will put in at Custome-house key there, And see, how the Factors, and Prentizes play there, False with their Masters; and gueld many a full packe, To spend it in pies, at the Dagger, and the Wool-sacke. Pvg. Braue, braue, Iniquity! will not this doe, Chiefe? Ini. Nay, boy, I will bring thee to the Bawds, and the Roysters, At Belins-gate, feasting with claret-wine, and oysters, From thence shoot the Bridge, childe, to the Cranes i' the Vintry, And see; there the gimblets, how they make their entry! Or, if thou hadst rather, to the Strand downe to fall, 'Gainst the Lawyers come dabled from Westminster-hall And marke how they cling, with their clyents together, Like Iuie to Oake; so Veluet to Leather: Ha, boy, I would shew thee. Pvg. Rare, rare! Div. Peace, dotard, And thou more ignorant thing, that so admir'st. Art thou the spirit thou seem'st? so poore? to choose This, for a Vice, t'aduance the cause of Hell, Now? as Vice stands this present yeere? Remember, What number it is. Six hundred and sixteene. Had it but beene fiue hundred, though some sixty Aboue; that's fifty yeeres agone, and six, (When euery great man had his Vice stand by him, In his long coat, shaking his wooden dagger) I could consent, that, then this your graue choice Might haue done that, with his Lord Chiefe, the which Most of his chamber can doe now. But Pug, As the times are, who is it, will receiue you? What company will you goe to? or whom mix with? Where canst thou carry him? except to Tauernes? To mount vp on a joynt-stoole, with a Iewes-trumpe, To put downe Cokeley, and that must be to Citizens? He ne're will be admitted, there, where Vennor comes. Hee may perchance, in taile of a Sheriffes dinner, Skip with a rime o'the Table, from New-nothing, And take his Almaine-leape into a custard, Shall make my Lad Maioresse, and her sisters, Laugh all their hoods ouer their shoulders. But, This is not that will doe, they are other things That are receiu'd now vpon earth, for Vices; Stranger, and newer: and chang'd euery houre. They ride 'hem like their horses off their legges, And here they come to Hell, whole legions of 'hem, Euery weeke tyr'd. Wee, still striue to breed, And reare 'hem vp new ones; but they doe not stand, When they come there: they turne 'hem on our hands. And it is fear'd they haue a stud o'their owne Will put downe ours. Both our breed, and trade VVill suddenly decay, if we preuent not. Vnlesse it be a Vice of quality, Or fashion, now, they take none from vs. Car-men Are got into the yellow starch, and Chimney-sweepers To their tabacco, and strong-waters, Hum, Meath, and Obarni. VVe must therefore ayme At extraordinary subtill ones, now, VVhen we doe send to keepe vs vp in credit. Not old Iniquities. Get you e'ne backe, Sir, To making of your rope of sand againe. You are not for the manners, nor the times: They haue their Vices, there, most like to Vertues; You cannnot know 'hem, apart, by any difference: They weare the same clothes, eate the same meate, Sleepe i'the selfe-same beds, ride i'those coaches. Or very like, foure horses in a coach, As the best men and women. Tissue gownes, Garters and roses, fourescore pound a paire, Embroydred stockings, cut-worke smocks, and shirts, More certaine marks of lechery, now, and pride, Then ere they were of true nobility! But Pug, since you doe burne with such desire To doe the Common-wealth of Hell some seruice; I am content, assuming of a body, You goe to earth, and visit men, a day. But you must take a body ready made, Pug, I can create you none: nor shall you forme Your selfe an aery one, but become subiect To all impression of the flesh, you take, So farre as humane frailty. So, this morning, There is a handsome Cutpurse hang'd at Tiborne, Whose spirit departed, you may enter his body: For clothes imploy your credit, with the Hangman, Or let our tribe of Brokers furnish you. And, looke, how farre your subtilty can worke Thorow those organs, with that body, spye Amongst mankind, (you cannot there want vices, And therefore the lesse need to carry 'hem wi'you) But as you make your soone at nights relation, And we shall find, it merits from the State, You shall haue both trust from vs, and imployment. Pvg. Most gracious Chiefe! Div. Onely, thus more I bind you, He shewes Fitz-dottrel to him, comming forth. To serue the first man that you meete; and him I'le shew you, now: Obserue him. Yon' is hee, You shall see, first, after your clothing. Follow him: But once engag'd, there you must stay and fixe; Not shift, vntill the midnights cocke doe crow. Pvg. Any conditions to be gone. Div. Away, then. Scene. II. Fitz-dottrell. I, they doe, now, name Bretnor, as before, They talk'd of Gresham, and of Doctor Fore-man, Francklin, and Fiske, and Sauory (he was in too) But there's not one of these, that euer could Yet shew a man the Diuell, in true sort. They haue their christalls, I doe know, and rings, And virgin parchment, and their dead-mens sculls Their rauens wings, their lights, and pentacles, With characters; I ha' seene all these. But— Would I might see the Diuell. I would giue A hundred o'these pictures, to see him Once out of picture. May I proue a cuckold, (And that's the one maine mortall thing I feare) If I beginne not, now, to thinke, the Painters Haue onely made him. 'Slight, he would be seene, One time or other else. He would not let An ancient gentleman, of a good house, As most are now in England, the Fitz-dottrel's, Runne wilde, and call vpon him thus in vaine, As I ha' done this twelue mone'th. If he be not, At all, why, are there Coniurers? If they be not, Why, are there lawes against 'hem? The best artists Of Cambridge, Oxford, Middlesex, and London, Essex, and Kent, I haue had in pay to raise him, These fifty weekes, and yet h'appeares not. 'Sdeath, I shall suspect, they, can make circles onely Shortly, and know but his hard names. They doe say, H'will meet a man (of himselfe) that has a mind to him. If hee would so, I haue a minde and a halfe for him: He should not be long absent. Pray thee, come I long for thee. An' I were with child by him, He expresses a longing to see the Diuell. And my wife, too; I could not more. Come, yet, Good Beelezebub. Were hee a kinde diuell, And had humanity in him, hee would come, but To saue ones longing. I should vse him well, I sweare, and with respect (would he would try mee) Not, as the Conjurers doe, when they ha' rais'd him. Get him in bonds, and send him post, on errands. A thousand miles, it is preposterous, that: And I beleeue, is the true cause he comes not. And hee has reason. Who would be engag'd, That might liue freely, as he may doe? I sweare, They are wrong all. The burn't child dreads the fire. They doe not know to entertaine the Diuell. I would so welcome him, obserue his diet, Get him his chamber hung with arras, two of 'hem, I' my own house; lend him my wiues wrought pillowes: And as I am an honest man, I thinke, If he had a minde to her, too; I should grant him, To make our friend-ship perfect. So I would not To euery man. If hee but heare me, now? And should come to mee in a braue young shape, And take me at my word? ha! Who is this? Scene. IIJ. Pvg. Fitz-dottrell. [Pvg.] Sir, your good pardon, that I thus presume Vpon your priuacy. I am borne a Gentleman; A younger brother; but, in some disgrace, Now, with my friends: and want some little meanes, To keepe me vpright, while things be reconcil'd. Please you, to let my seruice be of vse to you, Sir. Fit. Seruice? 'fore hell, my heart was at my mouth, Hee lookes and suruay's his feet: ouer and ouer. Till I had view'd his shooes well: for, those roses Were bigge inough to hide a clouen foote. No, friend, my number's full. I haue one seruant, Who is my all, indeed; and, from the broome Vnto the brush: for, iust so farre, I trust him. He is my Ward-robe man, my Cater, Cooke, Butler, and Steward; lookes vnto my horse: And helpes to watch my wife. H'has all the places, That I can thinke on, from the garret downward, E'en to the manger, and the curry-combe. Pvg. Sir, I shall put your worship to no charge, More then my meate, and that bu very little, I'le serue you for your loue. Fit. Ha? without wages? I'le harken o'that eare, were I at leasure. But now, I'm busie. 'Pr'y the, friend forbeare mee, And' thou hadst beene a Diuell, I should say Somewhat more to thee. Thou dost hinder, now, My meditations. Pvg. Sir, I am a Diuell. Fit. How! Pvg. A true Diuell, Sr. Fit. Nay, now, you ly: Vnder your fauour, friend, for, I'll not quarrell. I look'd o'your feet, afore, you cannot coozen mee, Your shoo's not clouen, Sir, you are whole hoof'd. He viewes his feete againe. Pvg. Sir, that's a popular error, deceiues many: But I am that, I tell you. Fit. What's your name? Pvg. My name is Diuell, Sr. Fit. Sai'st thou true. Pvg. Indeed, Sr. Fit. 'Slid! there's some omen i'this! what countryman? Pvg. Of Derby-shire, Sr. about the Peake. Fit. That Hole Belong'd to your Ancestors? Pvg. Yes, Diuells arse, Sr. Fit. I'll entertaine him for the name sake. Ha? And turne away my tother man? and saue Foure pound a yeere by that? there's lucke, and thrift too! The very Diuell may come, heereafter, as well. Friend, I receiue you: but (withall) I acquaint you, Aforehand, if yo' offend mee, I must beat you. It is a kinde of exercise, I vse. And cannot be without. Pvg. Yes, if I doe not Offend, you can, sure. Fit. Faith, Diuell, very hardly: I'll call you by your surname, 'cause I loue it. Scene. IIII. Ingine. VVittipol. Manly. Fitzdottrell. Pvg. [Ing.] Yonder hee walkes, Sir, I'll goe lift him for you. Wit. To him, good Ingine, raise him vp by degrees, Gently, and hold him there too, you can doe it. Shew your selfe now, a Mathematicall broker. Ing. I'll warrant you for halfe a piece. Wit. 'Tis done, Sr. Man. Is't possible there should be such a man? Wit. You shall be your owne witnesse, I'll not labour To tempt you past your faith. Man. And is his wife So very handsome, say you? Wit. I ha' not seene her, Since I came home from trauell: and they say, Shee is not alter'd. Then, before I went, I saw her once; but so, as shee hath stuck Still i' my view, no obiect hath remou'd her. Man. 'Tis a faire guest, Friend, beauty: and once lodg'd Deepe in the eyes, shee hardly leaues the Inne. How do's he keepe her? Wit. Very braue. Howeuer, Himselfe be sordide, hee is sensuall that way. In euery dressing, hee do's study her. Man. And furnish forth himselfe so from the Brokers? Wit. Yes, that's a hyr'd suite, hee now has one, To see the Diuell is an Asse, to day, in: (This Ingine gets three or foure pound a weeke by him) He dares not misse a new Play, or a Feast. What rate soeuer clothes be at; and thinkes Himselfe still new, in other mens old. Man. Put stay, Do's he loue meat so? Wit. Faith he do's not hate it. But that's not it. His belly and his palate Would be compounded with for reason Mary, A wit he has, of that strange credit with him, 'Gainst all mankinde; as it doth make him doe Iust what it list: it rauishes him forth, Whither it please, to any assembly or place, And would conclude him ruin'd, should hee scape One publike meeting, out of the beliefe Ingine hath won Fitz-dottrel, to say on the cloake. He has of his owne great, and Catholike strengths, In arguing, and discourse. It takes, I see: H'has got the cloak vpon him. Fit. A faire garment, By my faith, Ingine! Ing. It was neuer made, Sir, For three score pound, I assure you: 'Twill yeeld thirty. The plush, Sir, cost three pound, ten shillings a yard! And then the lace, and veluet. Fit. I shall, Ingine, Be lock'd at, pretitly, in it! Art thou sure The Play is play'd to day? Ing. ô here's the bill, Sr. Hee giues him the Play-bill. I', had forgot to gi't you. Fit. Ha? the Diuell! I will not lose you, Sirah! But, Ingine, thinke you, The Gallant is so furious in his folly? So mad vpon the matter, that hee'll part With's cloake vpo'these termes? Ing. Trust not your Ingine, Breake me to pieces else, as you would doe A rotten Crane, or an old rusty Iacke, That has not one true wheele in him. Doe but talke with him. Fit. I shall doe that, to satisfie you, Ingine, And my selfe too. With your leaue, Gentlemen. Hee turnes to Wittipol. Which of you is it, is so meere Idolater To my wiues beauty, and so very prodigall Vnto my patience, that, for the short parlee? Of one swift houres quarter, with my wife, He will depart with (let mee see) this cloake here The price of folly? Sir, are you the man? Wit. I am that vent'rer, Sir. Fit. Good time! your name Is Witty-pol? Wit. The same, Sr. Fit. And 'tis told me, Yo' haue trauell'd lately? Wit. That I haue, Sr. Fit. Truly, Your trauells may haue alter'd your complexion; But sure, your wit stood still. Wit. It may well be, Sir. All heads ha'not like growth. Fit. The good mans grauity, That left you land, your father, neuer taught you These pleasant matches? Wit. No, nor can his mirth, With whom I make 'hem, put me off. Fit. You are Resolu'd then? Wit. Yes, Sr. Fit. Beauty is the Saint, You'll sacrifice your selfe, into the shirt too? Wit. So I may still cloth, and keepe warme your wisdome? Fit. You lade me Sr! Wit. I know what you will beare, Sr. Fit. Well, to the point. 'Tis only, Sir, you say, To speake vnto my wife? Wit. Only, to speake to her. Fit. And in my presence? Wit. In your very presence. Fit. And in my hearing? Wit. In your hearing: so, You interrupt vs not. Fit. For the short space You doe demand, the fourth part of an houre, I thinke I shall, with some conuenient study, Hee shrugs himselfe vp on the cloake. And this good helpe to boot, bring my selfe to't. Wit. I aske no more. Fit. Please you, walk to'ard my house, Speake what you list; that time is yours: My right I haue departed with. But, not beyond, A minute, or a second, looke for. Length, And drawing out, ma'aduance much, to these matches. And I except all kissing. Kisses are Silent petitions still with willing Louers. Wit. Louers? How falls that o'your phantsie? Fit. Sir. I doe know somewhat, I forbid all lip-worke. Wit. I am not eager at forbidden dainties. Who couets vnfit things, denies him selfe. Fit. You say well, Sir, 'Twas prettily said, that same, He do's, indeed. I'll haue no touches, therefore, Nor takings by the armes, nor tender circles Cast 'bout the wast, but all be done at distance. Loue is brought vp with those soft migniard handlings; His pulse lies in his palme: and I defend All melting ioynts, and fingers, (that's my bargaine) I doe defend 'hem; any thing like action. But talke, Sir, what you will. Vse all the Tropes And Schemes, that Prince Quintilian can afford you: And much good do your Rhetoriques heart. You are welcome, Sir. Ingine, God b'w'you. Wit. Sir, I must condition To haue this Gentleman by, a witnesse. Fit. Well, I am content, so he be silent. Man. Yes, Sir. Fit. Come Diuell, I'll make you roome, streight. But I'll shew you First, to your Mistresse, who's no common one, You must conceiue, that brings this gaine to see her. I hope thou'st brought me good lucke. Pvg. I shall do't. Sir. Scene. V. VVittipol. Manly. Wittipol knocks his friend o'the brest. [Wit.] Ingine, you hope o'your halfe piece? 'Tis there, Sir. Be gone. Friend Manly, who's within here? fixed? Man. I am directly in a fit of wonder What'll be the issue of this conference! Wit. For that, ne'r vex your selfe, till the euent. How like yo'him? Man. I would faine see more of him. Wit. What thinke you of this? Man. I am past degrees of thinking. Old Africk, and the new America, With all their fruite of Monsters cannot shew So iust a prodigie. Wit. Could you haue beleeu'd, Without your sight, a minde so sordide inward, Should be so specious, and layd forth abroad, To all the shew, that euer shop, or ware was? Man. I beleeue any thing now, though I confesse His Vices are the most extremities I euer knew in nature. But, why loues hee The Diuell so? Wit. O Sr! for hidden treasure, Hee hopes to finde: and has propos'd himselfe So infinite a Masse, as to recouer, He cares not what he parts with, of the present, To his men of Art, who are the race, may coyne him. Promise gold-mountaines, and the couetous Are still most prodigall. Man. But ha' you faith, That he will hold his bargaine? Wit. O deare, Sir! He will not off on't. Feare him not. I know him. One basenesse still accompanies another. See! he is heere already, and his wife too. Man. A wondrous handsome creature, as I liue! Scene. VI. Fitz-dottrell. Mistresse Fitz-dottrel. Wittipol. Manly. [Fit.] Come wife, this is the Gentleman. Nay, blush not. Mrs. Fi. Why, what do you meane Sir? ha'you your reason? Fit. Wife, I do not know, that I haue lent it forth To any one; at least, without a pawne, wife: Or that I'haue eat or drunke the thing, of late, That should corrupt it. Wherefore gentle wife, Obey, it is thy vertue: hold no acts Of disputation. Mrs. Fi. Are you not enough The talke, of feasts, and meetingy, but you'll still Make argument for fresh? Fit. Why, carefull wedlocke, If I haue haue a longing to haue one tale more Goe of mee, what is that to thee, deare heart? Why shouldst thou enuy my delight? or crosse it? By being solicitous, when it not concernes thee? Mrs. Fi. Yes, I haue share in this The scorne will fall As bitterly on me, where both are laught at. Fit. Laught at, sweet bird? is that the scruple? Come, come, Thou art a Niaise. Which of your great houses, (I will not meane at home, here, but abroad) A Niaise is a young Hawke tane crying out of the nest. Your families in France, wife, send not forth Something, within the seuen yeere, may be laught at? I doe not say seuen moneths, nor seuen weekes, Nor seuen daies, nor houres: but seuen yeere wife. I giue 'hem time. Once, within seuen yeere, I thinke they may doe something may be laught at. In France, I keepe me there, still. Wherefore, wife, Let them that list, laugh still, rather then weepe For me; Heere is a cloake cost fifty pound, wife, Which I can sell for thirty, when I ha' seene All London in't, and London has seene mee. To day, I goe to the Black fryers Play-house, Sit ithe view, salute all my acquaintance, Rise vp betweene the Acts, let fall my cloake, Publish a handsome man, and a rich suite (As that's a speciall end, why we goe thither, All that pretend, to stand for't o'the Stage) The Ladies aske who's that? (For, they doe come To see vs, Loue, as wee doe to see them) Now, I shall lose all this, for the false feare Of being laught at? Yes, wusse. Let 'hem laugh, wife, Let me haue such another cloake to morrow. And let 'hem laugh againe, wife, and againe, And then grow fat with laughing, and then fatter, All my young Gallants, let 'hem bring their friends too: Shall I forbid 'hem? No, let heauen forbid 'hem: Or wit, if't haue any charge on 'hem. Come, thy eare, wife, Is all, I'll borrow of thee. Set your watch, Sir, Thou, onely art to heare, not speake a word, Doue, To ought he sayes. That I doe gi'you in precept, No lesse then councell, on your wiue-hood, wife, Not though he flatter you, or make court, or Loue, (As you must looke for these) or say, he raile; What ere his arts be, wife, I will haue thee Delude 'hem with a trick, thy obstinate silence; I know aduantages; and I loue to hit These pragmaticke young men, at their owne weapons. He disposes his wife to his place, and sets his watch. Is your watch ready? Here my saile beares, for you: Tack toward him, sweet Pinnace, where's your watch? Wit. I'le set it, Sir, with yours. Mrs. Fi. I must obey. Man. Her modesty seemes to suffer with her beauty, And so, as if his folly were away, It were worth pitty. Fit. Now, th'are right, beginne, Sir. But first, let me repeat the contract, briefely, I am, Sir, to inioy this cloake, I stand in, Freely, and as your gift; vpon condition Hee repeats his contract againe. You may as freely, speake here to my spouse, Your quarter of an houre alwaies keeping The measur'd distance of your yard, or more, From my said Spouse: and in my sight and hearing. This is your couenant? Wit. Yes, but you'll allow For this time spent, now? Fit. Set 'hem so much backe. Wit. I thinke, I shall not need it. Fit. Well, begin, Sir, There is your bound, Sir. Not beyond that rush. Wit. If you interrupt me, Sir, I shall discloake you. Wittipol beginnes. The time I haue purchast, Lady, is but short; And, therefore, if I imploy it thriftily, I hope I stand the neerer to my pardon. I am not here, to tell you, you are faire, Or louely, or how well you dresse you, Lady, I'll saue my selfe that eloquence of your glasse, Which can speake these thing's better to you then I. And 'tis a knowledge, wherein fooles may be As wise as a Court Parliament. Nor come I, With any preiudice, or doubt, that you Should, to the notice of your owne worth, neede Least reuelation. Shee's a simple woman, Know's not her good: (who euer knowes her ill) And at all caracts. That you are the wife, To so much blasted flesh, as scarce hath soule, In stead of salt, to keepe it sweete; I thinke, Will aske no witnesses, to proue. The cold Sheetes that you lie in, with the watching candle, That sees, how dull to any thaw of beauty, Pieces, and quarters, halfe, and whole nights, sometimes, The Diuell-giuen Elfine Squire, your husband, Doth leaue you, quitting heere his proper circle, For a much-worse i'the walks of Lincolnes Inne, Vnder the Elmes, t'expect the feind in vaine, there Will confesse for you. Fit. I did looke for this geere. Wit. And what a daughter of darknesse, he do's make you, Lock'd vp from all society, or object; Your eye not let to looke vpon a face, Vnder a Conjurers (or some mould for one, Hollow, and leane like his) but, by great meanes, As I now make; your owne too sensible sufferings, Without the extraordinary aydes, Of spells, or spirits, may assure you, Lady. For my part, I protest 'gainst all such practice, I worke by no false arts, medicines, or charmes To be said forward and backward. Fit. No, I except: Wit. Sir I shall ease you. Fit. Mum. Wit. Nor haue I ends, Lady, He offers to discloake him. Vpon you, more then this: to tell you how Loue Beauties good Angell, he that waits vpon her At all occasions, and no lesse then Fortune, Helps th'aduenturous, in mee makes that proffer, Which neuer faire one was so fond, to lose; Who could but reach a hand forth to her freedome: On the first sight, I lou'd you: since which time, Though I haue trauell'd, I haue beene in trauell More for this second blessing of your eyes Which now I' haue purchas'd, then for all aymes else. Thinke of it, Lady, be your minde as actiue, As is your beauty: view your object well. Examine both my fashion, and my yeeres Things, that are like, are soone familiar: And Nature ioyes, still in equality. Let not the signe o'the husband fright you, Lady. But ere your spring be gone, inioy it. Flowers, Though faire, are oft but of one morning. Thinke, All beauty doth not last vntill the autumne. You grow old, while I tell you this. And such, As cannot vse the present, are not wise. If Loue and Fortune will take care of vs, Why should our will be wanting? This is all. Wha doe you answer, Lady? Fit. Now, the sport comes. Shee stands mute. Let him still waite, waite, waite: while the watch goes, And the time runs. Wife! Wit. How! not any word? Nay, then, I taste a tricke in't. Worthy Lady, I cannot be so false to mine owne thoughts Of your presumed goodnesse, to conceiue This, as your rudenesse, which I see's impos'd. Yet, since your cautelous Iaylor, here stands by you, And yo'are deni'd the liberty o' the house, Let me take warrant, Lady, from your silence, (Which euer is interpreted consent) To make your answer for you: which shall be To as good purpose, as I can imagine, And what I thinke you'ld speake. Fit. No, no, no, no. He sets Mr. Manly, his friend in her place. Wit. I shall resume, Sr. Man. Sir, what doe you meane? Wit. One interruption more, Sir, and you goe Into your hose and doublet, nothing saues you. And therefore harken. This is for your wife. Man. You must play faire, Sr. Wit. Stand for mee, good friend. And speaks for her. Troth, Sir, tis more then true, that you haue vttred Of my vnequall, and so sordide match heere, With all the circumstances of my bondage. I haue a husband, and a two-legg'd one, But such a moon-ling, as no wit of man Or roses can redeeme from being an Asse. H'is growne too much, the story of mens mouthes, To scape his lading: should I make't my study, And lay all wayes, yea, call mankind to helpe, To take his burden off, why, this one act Of his, to let his wife out to be courted, And, at a price, proclaimes his asinine nature So lowd, as I am weary of my title to him. But Sir, you seeme a Gentleman of vertue, No lesse then blood; and one that euery way Lookes as he were of too good quality, To intrap a credulous woman, or betray her: Since you haue payd thus deare, Sir, for a visit, And made such venter, on your wit, and charge Meerely to see mee, or at most to speake to mee, I were too stupid; or (what's worse) ingrate Not to returne your venter. Thinke, but how, I may with safety doe it; I shall trust My loue and honour to you, and presume; You'll euer husband both, against this husband; Who, if we chance to change his liberall eares, To other ensignes, and with labour make A new beast of him, as hee shall deserue, Cannot complaine, hee is vnkindly dealth with. This day hee is to goe to a new play, Sir. From whence no feare, no, nor authority, Scarcely the Kings command, Sir, will restraine him, Now you haue fitted him with a Stage-garment, For the meere names sake, were there nothings else, And many more such iourneyes, hee will make. Which, if they now, or, any time heereafter, Offer vs opportunity, you heare, Sir, Who'll be as glad, and forward to imbrace, Meete, and enioy it chearefully as you. I humbly thanke you, Lady. Fit. Keepe your ground Sir. Wit. Will you be lightned? Fit. Mum. Wit. And but I am, By the sad contract, thus to take my leaue of you At this so enuious distance, I had taught Our lips ere this, to seale the happy mixture Made of our soules. But we must both, now, yeeld To the necessity. Doe not thinke yet, Lady, But I can kisse, and touch, and laugh, and whisper, And doe those crowning court-ships too, for which Day, and the publike haue allow'd no name But, now, my bargaine binds me. 'Twere rude iniury, T'importune more, or vrge a noble nature, To what of it's owne bounty it is prone to: Else, I should speake—But, Lady, I loue so well, As I will hope, you'll doe so to. I haue done, Sir. Fit. Well, then, I ha'won? Wit. Sir, and I may win, too. Fit. O yes! no doubt on't. I'll take carefull order, That shee shall hang forth ensignes at the window, To tell you when I am absent. Or I'll keepe Three or foure foote-men, ready still of purpose, To runne and fetch you at her longings, Sir. I'll goe bespeake me straight a guilt caroch, For her and you to take the ayre in: yes, Into Hide-parke, and thence into Black-Fryers, Visit the painters, where you may see pictures, And note the properest limbs, and how to make 'hem. Or what doe you say vnto a middling Gossip? To bring you aye together, at her lodging? Vnder pretext of teaching o' my wife Some rare receit of drawing almond milke? ha? It shall be a part of my care. Good Sir, God b'w'you. I ha'kept the contract, and the cloake is mine owne. Wit. Why, much good do't you Sr; it may fall out, That you ha' bought it deare, though I ha'not sold it. Fit. A pretty riddle! Fare you well, good Sir. Hee turnes his wife about. Wife, your face this way, looke on me: and thinke Yo'haue had a wicked dreame, wife, and forget it. Man. This is the strangest motion I ere saw. Fit. Now, wife, sits this faire cloake the worse vpon me, For my great sufferings, or your little patience? ha? They laugh, you thinke? Mrs. Fi. Why Sr. and you might see't. What thought, they haue of you, may be soone collected By the young Genlemans speache. Fit. Young Gentleman? Death! you are in loue with him, are you? could he not Be nam'd the Gentleman, without the young? Vp to your Cabbin againe. Mrs. Fi. My cage, yo' were best To call it? Fit. Yes, sing there. You'ld faine be making Blanck Manger with him at your mothers! I know you. Goe get you vp. How now! what say you, Diuell? Scene. VII. Pvg. Fitzdottrel. Ingine. [Pvg.] Heere is one Ingine, Sir, desires to speake with you. Fit. I thought he brought some newes, of a broker! Well, Let him come in, good Diuell: fetch him else. O, my fine Ingine! what's th'affaire? more cheats? Ing. No Sir, the Wit, the Braine, the great Proiector, I told you of, is newly come to towne. Fit. Where, Ingine? Ing. I ha'brought him (H'is without) Ere hee pull'd off his boots, Sir, but so follow'd, For businesses: Fit. But what is a Proiector? I would conceiue. Ing. Why, one Sir, that proiects Wayes to enrich men, or to make 'hem great, By suites, by marriages, by vndertakings: According as hee sees they humour it. Fit. Can hee not coniure at all? Ing. I thinke he can, Sir. (To tell you true) but, you doe know, of late, The State hath tane such note of 'hem, and compell'd 'hem, To enter such great bonds, they dare not practice. Fit. 'Tis true, and I lie fallow for't, the while! Ing. O, Sir! you'll grow the richer for the rest. Fit. I hope I shall: but Ingine, you doe talke Somewhat too much, o'my courses. My Cloake-customer Could tell mee strange particulars. Ing. By my meanes? Fit. How should he haue 'hem else? Ing. You do not know, Sr, What he has: and by what arts! A monei'd man, Sir, And is as great with your Almanack-Men, as you are! Fit. That Gallant? Ing. You make the other wait too long, here: And hee is extreme punctuall. Fit. Is he a gallant? Ing. Sir, you shall see: He'is in his riding suit, As hee comes now from Court. But heere him speake: Minister matter to him, and then tell mee.</field>

(I'll giue you an account of this to morrow.) To another. Yes, I will talke no lesse, and doe it too; If they were Myriades: and without the Diuell, By direct meanes, it shall be good in law. Ing. Sir. Mer. Tell Mr. Wood-cock, I'll not faile to meet him Vpon th'Exchange at night. Pray him to haue The writings there, and wee'll dispatch it: Sir, You are a Gentleman of a good presence, A handsome man (I haue considered you) As a fit stocke to graft honours vpon: I haue a Proiect to make you a Duke, now. That you must be one, within so many moneths, As I set downe, out of true reason of state, You sha' not auoyd it. But you must harken, then. Ing. Harken? why Sr, do you doubt his eares? Alas! You doe not know Master Fitz-dottrel. Fit. He do's not know me indeed. I thank you, Ingine, For rectifying him. Mer. Good! Why, Ingine, then I'le tell it you. (I see you ha' credit, here, And, that you can keepe counsell, I'll not question.) Hee shall but be an vndertaker with mee, In a most feasible bus'nesse. It shall cost him Nothing. Ing. Good, Sr. Mer. Except he please, but's count'nance; (That I will haue) t'appeare in't, to great men, For which I'll make him one. Hee shall not draw A string of's purse. I'll driue his pattent for him. We'll take in Cittizens, Commoners, and Aldermen, To beare the charge, and blow 'hem off againe, Like so many dead flyes, when 'tis carryed. The thing is for recouery of drown'd Land, Whereof the Crown's to haue a moiety, If it be owner; Else, the Crowne and Owners To share that moyety: and the recouerers T'enioy the tother moyety, for their charge. Ing. Throughout England? Mer. Yes, which will arise To eyghteene millions, seuen the first yeere: I haue computed all, and made my suruay Vnto an acre, I'll beginne at the Pan, Not, at the skirts: as some ha' done, and lost, All that they wrought, their timber-worke, their trench, Their bankes all borne away, or else fill'd vp By the next winter. Tut, they neuer went The way: I'll haue it all. Ing. A Gallant tract Of land it is! Mer. 'Twill yeeld a pound an acre. Wee must let cheape, euer, at first. But Sir, This lookes too large for you, I see. Come hither, We'll haue a lesse. Here's a plain fellow, you see him, Has his black bag of papers, there, in Buckram, Wi'not be sold for th'Earledome of Pancridge: Draw, Gi'me out one, by chance. Proiect; foure dogs skins? Twelue thousand pound! the very worst, at first. Fit. Pray you let's see't Sir. Mer. 'Tis a toy, a trifle! Fit. Trifle! 12. thousand pound for dogs-skins? Mer. Yes, But, by my way of dressing, you must know, Sir, And med'cining the leather, to a height Of improu'd ware, like your Borachio Of Spaine, Sir. I can fetch nine thousand for't— Ing. Of the Kings glouer? Mer. Yes, how heard you that? Ing. Sir, I doe know you can. Mer. Within this houre: And reserue halfe my secret. Pluck another; See if thou hast a happier hand: I thought so. Hee pluckes out the 2. Bottle-ale. The very next worse to it! Bottle-ale. Yet, this is two and twenty thousand! Pr'y thee Pull out another, two or three. Fit. Good, stay, friend, By bottle-ale, two and twenty thousand pound? Mer. Yes, Sir, it's cast to penny-hal'penny-farthing, O'the back-side, there you may see it, read, I will not bate a Harrington o'the summe. I'll winne it i'my water, and my malt, My furnaces, and hanging o'my coppers, The tonning, and the subtilty o' my yest; And, then the earth of my bottles, which I dig, Turne vp, and steepe, and worke, and neale, my selfe, To a degree of Porc'lane. You will wonder, At my proportions, what I will put vp In seuen yeeres! for so long time, I aske For my inuention. I will saue in cork, In my mere stop'ling, 'boue three thousand pound, Within that terme: by googing of 'hem out Iust to the size of my bottles, and not slicing. There's infinite losse i'that. What hast thou there? Hee drawes out another. Raisines. O'making wine of raisins: this is in hand, now, Ing. Is not that strange, Sr, to make wine of raisins? Mer. Yes, and as true a wine, as th'wines of France, Or Spaine, or Italy, Looke of what grape My raisin is, that wine I'll render perfect, As of the muscatell grape, I'll render muscatell; Of the Canary, his; the Claret, his; So of all kinds: and bate you of the prices, Of wine, throughout the kingdome, halfe in halfe. Ing. But, how, Sr, if you raise the other commodity, Raysins? Mer. Why, then I'll make it out of black-berries: And it shall doe the same. 'Tis but more art, And the charge lesse. Take out another. Fit. No, good Sir. Saue you the trouble, I'le not looke, nor heare Of any, but your first, there; the Drown'd land: If't will doe, as you say. Mer. Sir, there's not place, To gi'you demonstration of these things. They are a little to subtle. But, I could shew you Such a necessity in't, as you must be But what you please: against the receiu'd heresie, That England beares no Dukes. Keepe you the land, Sr, The greatnesse of th'estate shall throw't vpon you. If you like better turning it to money, What may not you, Sr, purchase with that wealth? Say, you should part with two o'your millions, To be the thing you would, who would not do't? As I protest, I will, out of my diuident, Lay, for some pretty principality, In Italy, from the Church: Now, you perhaps, Fancy the smoake of England, rather? But— Ha' you no priuate roome, Sir, to draw to, T'enlarge our selues more vpon. Fit. O yes, Diuell! Mer. These, Sir, are bus'nesses, aske to be carryed With caution, and in cloud. Fit. I apprehend, They doe so, Sr. Diuell, which way is your Mistresse? Pvg. Aboue, Sr. in her chamber. Fit. O that's well. Then, this way, good, Sir. Mer. I shall follow you; Traines, Gi'mee the bag, and goe you presently, Commend my seruice to my Lady Tail-bush. Tell her I am come from Court this morning; say, I' haue got our bus'nesse mou'd, and well: Intreat her, That shee giue you the four-score Angels, and see 'hem Dispos'd of to my Councel, Sir Poul Eytherside. Sometime, to day, I'll waite vpon her Ladiship, With the relation. Ing. Sir, of what dispatch, He is! Do you marke? Mer. Ingine, when did you see My cousin Euer-ill? keepes he still your quarter? I'the Bermudas? Ing. Yes, Sir, he was writing This morning, very hard. Mer. Be not you knowne to him, That I am come to Towne: I haue effected A businesse for him, but I would haue it take him, Before he thinks for't. Ing. Is it past? Mer. Not yet. 'Tis well o'the way. Ing. O Sir! your worship takes Infinit paines. Mer. I loue Friends, to be actiue: A sluggish nature puts off man, and kinde. Ing. And such a blessing followes it. Mer. I thanke My fate. Pray you let's be priuate, Sir? Fit. In, here. Mer. Where none may interrupt vs. Fit. You heare, Diuel, Lock the streete-doores fast, and let no one in (Except they be this Gentlemans followers) To trouble mee. Doe you marke? Yo' haue heard and seene Something, to day; and, by it, you may gather Your Mistresse is a fruite, that's worth the stealing And therefore worth the watching. Be you sure, now, Yo' haue all your eyes about you; and let in No lace-woman; nor bawd, that brings French-masques, And cut-works. See you? Nor old croanes, with wafers, To conuey letters. Nor no youths, disguis'd Like country-wiues, with creame, and marrow-puddings. Much knauery may be vented in a pudding, Much bawdy intelligence: They' are shrewd ciphers. Nor turne the key to any neyghbours neede; Be't but to kindle fire, or begg a little, Put it out, rather: all out, to an ashe, That they may see no smoake. Or water, spill it: Knock o'the empty tubs, that by the sound, They may be forbid entry. Say, wee are robb'd, If any come to borrow a spoone, or so. I wi'not haue good fortune, or gods blessing Let in, while I am busie. Pvg. I'le take care, Sir. They sha' not trouble you, if they would. Fit. Well, doe so. Scene. II. Pvg. Mistresse Fitzdottrell. [Pvg.] I haue no singular seruice of this, now? Nor no superlatiue Master? I shall wish To be in hell againe, at leasure? Bring, A Vice from thence? That had bin such a subtilty, As to bring broad-clothes hither: or transport Fresh oranges into Spaine. I finde it, now; My Chiefe was i'the right. Can any feind Boast of a better Vice, then heere by nature, And art, th'are owners of? Hell ne'r owne mee, But I am taken! the fine tract of it Pulls mee along! To heare men such professors Growne in our subtlest Sciences! My first Act, now, Shall be, to make this Master of mine cuckold: The primitiue worke of darknesse, I will practise! I will deserue so well of my faire Mistresse, By my discoueries, first; my counsells after; And keeping counsell, after that: as who, So euer, is one, I'le be another, sure, I'll ha' my share. Most delicate damn'd flesh! Shee will be! O! that I could stay time, now, Midnight will come too fast vpon mee, I feare, Shee sends Diuell out. To cut my pleasure— Mrs. Fi. Looke at the back-doore, One knocks, see who it is. Pvg. Dainty she-Diuell! Mrs. Fi. I cannot get this venter of the cloake, Out of my fancie; nor the Gentlemans way, He tooke, which though 'twere strange, yet 'twas handsome, And had a grace withall, beyond the newnesse. Sure he will thinke mee that dull stupid creature, Hee said, and may conclude it; if I finde not Some thought to thanke th'attemp. He did presume, By all the carriage of it, on my braine, For answer; and will sweare 'tis very barren, Diuell returnes. If it can yeeld him no returne Who is it? Pvg. Mistresse, it is, but first, let me assure The excellence, of Mistresses, I am, Although my Masters man, my Mistresse slaue, The seruant of her secrets, and sweete turnes, And know, what fitly will conduce to either. Mrs. Fi. What's this? I pray you come to your selfe and thinke What your part is: to make an answer. Tell, Who is it at the doore? Pvg. The Gentleman, Mr s, Who was at the cloake-charge to speake with you, This morning, who expects onely to take Some small command'ments from you, what you please, Worthy your forme, hee saies, and gentlest manners. Mrs. Fi. O! you'll anon proue his hyr'd man, I feare, What has he giu'n you, for this message? Sir, Bid him put off his hopes of straw, and leaue To spread his nets, in view, thus. Though they take Master Fitz-dottrel, I am no such foule, Nor faire one, tell him, will be had with stalking. And wish him to for-beare his acting to mee, At the Gentlemans chamber-window in Lincolnes-Inne there, That opens to my gallery: else, I sweare T'acquaint my husband with his folly, and leaue him To the iust rage of his offended iealousie. Or if your Masters sense be not so quicke To right mee, tell him, I shall finde a friend That will repaire mee. Say, I will be quiet. In mine owne house? Pray you, in those words giue it him. He goes out. Pvg. This is some foole turn'd! Mrs. Fi. If he be the Master, Now, of that state and wit, which I allow him; Sure, hee will vnderstand mee: I durst not Be more direct. For this officious fellow, My husbands new groome, is a spie vpon me, I finde already. Yet, if he but tell him This in my words, hee cannot but conceiue Himselfe both apprehended, and requited. I would not haue him thinke hee met a statue: Or spoke to one, not there, though I were silent. How now? ha' you told him? Pvg. Yes. Mrs. Fi. And what saies he? Pvg. Sayes he? That which my self would say to you, if I durst. That you are proude, sweet Mistresse? and with all, A little ignorant, to entertaine The good that's proffer'd; and (by your beauties leaue) Not all so wise, as some true politique wife Would be: who hauing match'd with such a Nupson (I speake it with my Masters peace) whose face Hath left t'accuse him, now, for't doth confesse him, What you can make him; will yet (out of scruple, And a spic'd conscience) defraud the poore Gentleman, At least delay him in the thing he longs for, And makes it hs whole study, how to compasse, Onely a title. Could but he write Cuckold, He had his ends. For, looke you— Mrs. Fi. This can be None but my husbands wit. Pvg. My pretious Mr s. M. Fi. It creaks his Ingine: The groome neuer durst Be, else, so saucy— Pvg. If it were not clearely, His worshipfull ambition; and the top of it; The very forked top too: why should hee Keepe you, thus mur'd vp in a back-roome, Mistresse, Allow you ne'r a casement to the streete, Feare of engendering by the eyes, with gallants, Forbid you paper, pen and inke, like Rats-bane. Search your halfe pint of muscatell, lest a letter Be suncke i'the pot: and hold your new-laid egge Against the fire, lest any charme be writ there? Will you make benefit of truth, deare Mistresse, If I doe tell it you: I do't not often? I am set ouer you, imploy'd, indeed, To watch your steps, your lookes, your very breathings, And to report them to him. Now, if you Will be a true, right, delicate sweete Mistresse, Why, wee will make a Cokes of this Wise Master, We will, my Mistresse, an absolute fine Cokes, And mock, to ayre, all the deepe diligences Of such a solemne, and effectuall Asse, An Asse to so good purpose, as wee'll vse him. I will contriue it so, that you shall goe To Playes, to Masques, to Meetings, and to Feasts. For, why is all this Rigging, and fine Tackle, Mistris, If you neat handsome vessells, of good sayle, Put not forth euer, and anon, with your nets Abroad into the world. It is your fishing. There, you shal choose your friends, your seruants, Lady, Your squires of honour; I'le conuey your letters, Fetch answers, doe you all the offices, That can belong to your bloud, and beauty. And, For the variety, at my times, although I am not in due symmetrie, the man Of that proportion; or in rule Of physicke, of the iust complexion; Or of that truth of Picardill, in clothes, To boast a soueraignty o're Ladies: yet I know, to do my turnes, sweet Mistresse. Come, kisse— Mrs. Fi. How now! Pvg. Deare delicate Mist. I am your slaue, Your little worme, that loues you: your fine Monkey; Your Dogge, your Iacke, your Pug, that longs to be Stil'd, o'your pleasures. Mrs. Fit. Heare you all this? Sir, Pray you, Shee thinkes her husband watches. Come from your standing, doe, a little, spare Your selfe, Sir, from your watch, t'applaud your Squire, That so well followes your instructions! Scene. III. Fitz-dottrell. Mistresse Fitz-dottrel. Pvg. [Fit.] How now, sweet heart? what's the matter? Mrs. Fi. Good! You are a stranger to the plot! you set not Your saucy Diuell, here, to tempt your wife, With all the insolent vnciuill language, Or action, he could vent? Fit. Did you so, Diuell? Mrs. Fit. Not you? you were not planted i' your hole to heare him, Vpo' the stayres? or here, behinde the hangings? I doe not know your qualities? he durst doe it, And you not giue directions? Fit. You shall see, wife, Whether he durst, or no: and what it was, I did direct. Her husband goes out, and enters presently with a cudgell vpon him. Pvg. Sweet Mistresse, are you mad? Fit. You most mere Rogue! you open manifest Villaine! You Feind apparant you! you declar'd Hel-hound! Pvg. Good Sr. Fit. Good Knaue good Rascal, and good Traitor. Now, I doe finde you parcel-Diuell, indeed. Vpo' the point of trust? I' your first charge? The very day o' your probation? To tempt your Mistresse? You doe see, good wedlocke, How I directed him. Mrs. Fit. Why, where Sr, were you? Fit. Nay, there is one blow more, for exercise: After a pause. He strikes him againe I told you, I should doe it. Pvg. Would you had done, Sir. Fit. O wife, the rarest man! yet there's another To put you in mind o'the last. such a braue man, wife! Within, he has his proiects, and do's vent 'hem, The gallantest! where you tentiginous? ha? and againe. Would you be acting of the Incubus? Did her silks rustling moue you? Pvg. Gentle Sir. Fit. Out of my sight. If thy name were not Diuell, Thou should'st not stay a minute with me. In, Goe, yet stay: yet goe too. I am resolu'd, What I will doe: and you shall know't afore-hand. Soone as the Gentleman is gone, doe you heare? I'll helpe your lisping. Wife, such a man, wife! Diuell goes out. He has such plots! He will make mee a Duke! No lesse, by heauen! six Mares, to your coach, wife! That's your proportion! And your coach-man bald! Because he shall be bare, inough. Doe not you laugh, We are looking for a place, and all, i' the map What to be of. Haue faith, be not an Infidell. You know, I am not easie to be gull'd. I sweare, when I haue my millions, else, I'll make Another Dutchesse; if you ha' not faith. Mrs. Fi. You'll ha' too much, I feare, in these false spirits, Fit. Spirits? O, no such thing! wife! wit, mere wit! This man defies the Diuell, and all his works! He dos't by Ingine, and deuises, hee! He has his winged ploughes, that goe with sailes, Will plough you forty acres, at once! and mills, Will spout you water, ten miles off! All Crowland Is ours, wife; and the fens, from vs, in Norfolke, To the vtmost bound of Lincoln-shire! we haue view'd it, And measur'd it within all; by the scale! The richest tract of land, Loue, i' the kingdome! There will be made seuenteene, or eighteene millions; Or more, as't may be handled! wherefore, thinke, Sweetheart, if th'hast a fancy to one place, More then another, to be Dutchesse of; Now, name it: I will ha't, what ere it cost, (If't will be had for money) either here, Or'n France, or Italy. Mrs. Fi. You ha' strange phantasies! Scene. IV. Mere-craft. Fitz-dottrell. Ingine. [Mer.] VVhere are you, Sir? Fit. I see thou hast no talent This way, wife. Vp to thy gallery; doe, Chuck, Leaue vs to talke of it, who vnderstand it. Mer. I thinke we ha' found a place to fit you, now, Sir. Gloc'ster. Fit. O, no, I'll none! Mer. Why, Sr? Fit. Tis fatall. Mer: That you say right in. Spenser, I thinke, the younger, Had his last honour thence. But, he was but Earle. Fit. I know not that, Sir. But Thomas of Woodstocke, I'm sure, was Duke, and he was made away, At Calice; as Duke Humphrey was at Bury: And Richard the third, you know what end he came too. Mer. By m'faith you are cunning i'the Chronicle, Sir. Fit. No, I confesse I ha't from the Play-bookes, And thinke they'are more authentique. Ing. That's sure, Sir. He whispers him of a place. Mer. What say you (to this then) Fit. No, a noble house. Pretends to that. I will doe no man wrong. Mer. Then take one proposition more, and heare it As past exception. Fit. What's that? Mer. To be Duke of those lands, you shall recouer: take Your title, thence, Sir, Duke of the Drown'd-lands, Or Drown'd-land. Fit. Ha? that last has a good sound! I like it well. The Duke of Drown'd-land? Ing. Yes; It goes like Groen-land, Sir, if you marke it. Mer: I, And drawing thus your honour from the worke, You make the reputation of that, greater; And stay't the longer i' your name. Fit. 'Tis true. Drown'd-lands will liue in Drown'd-land! Mer. Yes, when you Ha' no foote left; as that must be, Sir, one day. And, though it tarry in your heyres, some forty, Fifty descents, the longer liuer, at last, yet, Must thrust 'hem out on't: if no quirk in law, Or odde Vice o'their owne not do' it first. Wee see those changes, daily: the faire lands, That were the Clyents, are the Lawyers, now: And those rich Mannors, there, of good man Taylors, Had once more wood vpon 'hem, then the yard, By which th'were measur'd out for the last purchase. Nature hath these vicissitudes. Shee makes No man a state of perpetuery, Sir. Fit. Yo'are i'the right. Let's in then, and conclude. Hee spies Diuell. I my sight, againe? I'll talke with you, anon. Scene. V. Pvg. Svre hee will geld mee, if I stay: or worse, Pluck out my tongue, one o'the two. This Foole, There is no trusting of him: and to quit him, Were a contempt against my Chiefe, past pardon. It was a shrewd disheartning this, at first! Who would ha' thought a woman so well harness'd, Or rather well-caparison'd, indeed, That weares such petticoates, and lace to her smocks, Broad seaming laces (as I see 'hem hang there) And garters which are lost, if shee can shew 'hem, Could ha' done this? Hell! why is shee so braue? It cannot be to please Duke Dottrel, sure, Nor the dull pictures, in her gallery, Nor her owne deare reflection, in her glasse; Yet that may be: I haue knowne many of 'hem, Beginne their pleasure, but none end it, there: (That I consider, as I goe a long with it) They may, for want of better company, Or that they thinke the better, spend an houre; Two, three, or foure, discoursing with their shaddow: But sure they haue a farther speculation. No woman drest with so much care, and study, Doth dresse her selfe in vaine. I'll vexe this probleme, A little more, before I leaue it, sure. Scene. VI. VVittipol. Manly. Mistresse Fitz-dottrel. Pvg. [Wit.] This was a fortune, happy aboue thought, That this should proue thy chamber; which I fear'd Would be my greatest trouble! this must be The very window, and that the roome. Man. It is. I now remember, I haue often seene there A woman, but I neuer mark'd her much. Wit. Where was your soule, friend? Man. Faith, but now, and then, Awake vnto those obiects. Wit. You pretend so. Let mee not liue, if I am not in loue More with her wit, for this direction, now, Then with her forme, though I ha' prais'd that prettily, Since I saw her, and you, to day. Read those. Hee giues him a paper, wherein is the copy of a Song. They'll goe vnto the ayre you loue so well. Try 'hem vnto the note, may be the musique Will call her sooner; light, shee's here! Sing quickly. Mrs. Fit. Either he vnderstood him not: or else, The fellow was not faithfull in deliuery, Of what I bad. And, I am iustly pay'd, That might haue made my profit of his seruice, But, by mis-taking, haue drawne on his enuy, And done the worse defeate vpon my selfe. Manly sings, Pug enters perceiues it. How! Musique? then he may be there: and is sure. Pvg. O! Is it so? Is there the enter-view? Haue I drawne to you, at last, my cunning Lady? The Diuell is an Asse! fool'd off! and beaten! Nay, made an instrument! and could not sent it! Well, since yo' haue showne the malice of a woman, No lesse then her true wit, and learning, Mistresse, I'll try, if little Pug haue the malignity To recompence it, and so saue his danger. 'Tis not the paine, but the discredite of it, The Diuell should not keepe a body intire. Wit. Away, fall backe, she comes. Man. I'll leaue you, Sir, The Master of my chamber. I haue businesse. Wit. Mr s! Mrs. Fi. You make me paint, Sr. Wit. The'are faire colours, Lady, and naturall! I did receiue Some commands from you, lately, gentle Lady, This Scene is acted at two windo's, as out of two contiguous buildings. But so perplex'd, and wrap'd in the deliuery, As I may feare t'haue mis-interpreted: But must make suit still, to be neere your grace. Mrs. Fi. Who is there with you, Sr? Wit. None, but my selfe. It falls out, Lady, to be a deare friends lodging. Wherein there's some conspiracy of fortune With your poore seruants blest affections. Mrs. Fi. Who was it sung? Wit. He, Lady, but hee's gone, Vpon my entreaty of him, seeing you Approach the window. Neither need you doubt him, If he were here. He is too much a gentleman. Mrs. Fi. Sir, if you iudge me by this simple action, And by the outward habite, and complexion Of easinesse, it hath, to your designe; You may with Iustice, say, I am a woman: And a strange woman. But when you shall please, To bring but that concurrence of my fortune, To memory, which to day your selfe did vrge: It may beget some fauour like excuse, Though none like reason. Wit. No, my tune-full Mistresse? Then, surely, Loue hath none; nor Beauty any; Nor Nature violenced, in both these: With all whose gentle tongues you speake, at once. I thought I had inough remou'd, already, That scruple from your brest, and left yo' all reason; When, through my mornings perspectiue I shewd you A man so aboue excuse, as he is the cause, Why any thing is to be done vpon him: And nothing call'd an iniury, mis-plac'd. I' rather, now had hope, to shew you how Loue By his accesses, growes more naturall: And, what was done, this morning, with such force Was but deuis'd to serue the present, then. That since Loue hath the honour to approach He growes more familiar in his Court-ship. These sister-swelling brests; and touch this soft, And rosie hand; hee hath the skill to draw Their Nectar forth, with kissing; and could make More wanton salts, from this braue promontory, Downe to this valley, then the nimble Roe; playes with her paps, kisseth her hands, &amp;c. Could play the hopping Sparrow, 'bout these nets; And sporting Squirell in these crisped groues; Bury himselfe in euery Silke-wormes kell, Is here vnrauell'd; runne into the snare, Which euery hayre is, cast into a curle, To catch a Cupid flying: Bath himselfe In milke, and roses, here, and dry him, there; Warme his cold hands, to play with this smooth, round, And well torn'd chin, as with the Billyard ball; Rowle on these lips, the banks of loue, and there At once both plant, and gather kisses. Lady, Shall I, with what I haue made to day here, call All sense to wonder, and all faith to signe The mysteries reuealed in your forme? And will Loue pardon mee the blasphemy I vtter'd, when I said, a glasse could speake This beauty, or that fooles had power to iudge it? Doe but looke, on her eyes! They doe light— All that Loue's world comprizeth! Doe but looke on her hayre! it is bright, As Loue's starre, when it riseth! Doe but marke, her fore-head's smoother, Then words that sooth her! And from her arched browes, such a grace Sheds it selfe through the face; As alone, there triumphs to the life, All the gaine, all the good, of the elements strife! Haue you seene but a bright Lilly grow, Before rude hands haue touch'd it? Haue you mark'd but the fall of the Snow, Before the soyle hath smuch'd it? Haue you felt the wooll o' the Beuer? Or Swans downe, euer? Or, haue smelt o' the bud o' the Bryer? Or the Nard i' the fire? Or, haue tasted the bag o' the Bee? O, so white! O, so soft! O, so sweet is shee! Scene. VII. Fitz-dottrell. Wittipol. Pvg. [Fit.] Is shee so, Sir? and, I will keepe her so. Her husband appeares at her back. If I know how, or can: that wit of man Will doe't, I'll goe no farther. At this windo' She shall no more be buz'd at. Take your leaue on't. If you be sweet meates, wedlock, or sweet flesh, All's one: I doe not loue this hum about you. A flye-blowne wife is not so proper, In: Hee speakes out of his wiues window. For you, Sr, looke to heare from mee. Wit. So, I doe, Sir. Fit. No, but in other termes. There's no man offers This to my wife, but paies for't. Wit. That haue I, Sir. Fit. Nay, then, I tell you, you are. Wit. What am I, Sir? Fit. Why, that I'll thinke on, when I ha' cut your throat. Wit. Goe, you are an Asse. Fit. I am resolu'd on't, Sir. Wit. I thinke you are. Fit. To call you to a reckoning. Wit. Away, you brokers blocke, you property. Fit. S'light, if you strike me, I'll strike your Mistresse, Hee strikes his wife. Wit. O! I could shoote mine eyes at him, for that, now; Or leaue my teeth in him, were they cuckolds bane, Inough to kill him. What prodigious, Blinde, and most wicked change of fortune's this? I ha' no ayre of patience: all my vaines Swell, and my sinewes start at iniquity of it. I shall breake, breake. Pvg. This for the malice of it, And my reuenge may passe! But, now, my conscience The Diuell speakes below. Tells mee, I haue profited the cause of Hell But little, in the breaking-off their loues. Which, if some other act of mine repaire not, I shall heare ill of in my accompt. Fit. O, Bird! Could you do this? 'gainst me? and at this time, now? Fitz-dottrel enters with his wife as come downe. When I was so imploy'd, wholly for you, Drown'd i'my care (more, then the land, I sweare, I'haue hope to win) to make you peere-lesse? studying, For footemen for you, fine pac'd huishers, pages, To serue you o'the knee; with what Knights wife, To beare your traine, and sit with your foure women In councell, and receiue intelligences, From forraigne parts, to dresse you at all pieces! Y'haue (a'most) turn'd my good affection, to you; Sowr'd my sweet thoughts; all my pure purposes: I could now finde (i'my very heart) to make Another, Lady Dutchesse; and depose you. Well, goe your waies in. Diuell, you haue redeem'd all. I doe forgiue you. And I'll doe you good. Scene VIIJ. Mere-craft. Fitz-dottrel. Ingine. Traines. [Mer.] Why ha you these excursions? where ha' you beene, Sir? Fit. Where I ha'beene vex'd a little, with a toy! Mer. O Sir! no toyes must trouble your graue head, Now it is growing to be great. You must Be aboue all those things. Fit. Nay, nay, so I will. Mer. Now you are to'ard the Lord, you must put off The man, Sir. Ing. He saies true. Mer. You must do nothing As you ha'done it heretofore; not know, Or salute any man. Ing. That was your bed-fellow, The other moneth. Mer. The other moneth? the weeke. Thou dost not know the priuiledges, Ingine, Follow that Title; nor how swift: To day, When he has put on his Lords face once, then— Fit. Sir, for these things I shall doe well enough, There is no feare of me. But then, my wife is Such an vntoward thing! shee'll neuer learne How to comport with it! I am out of all Conceipt, on her behalfe. Mer. Best haue her taught, Sir. Fit. Where? Are there any Schooles for Ladies? Is there An Academy for women? I doe know, For men, there was: I learn'd in it, my selfe, Ingine whispers Merecraft, Merecraft turnes to Fitz-dottrel. To make my legges, and doe my postures. Ing. Sir. Doe you remember the conceipt you had— O'the Spanish gowne, at home? Mer. Ha! I doe thanke thee, With all my heart, deare Ingine. Sir, there is A certaine Lady, here about the Towne, An English widdow, who hath lately trauell'd, But shee's call'd the Spaniard; cause she came Latest from thence: and keepes the Spanish habit. Such a rare woman! all our women heere, That are of spirit, and fashion flocke, vnto her, As to their President; their Law; their Canon; More then they euer did, to Oracle-Foreman. Such rare receipts shee has, Sir, for the face; Such oyles; such tinctures; such pomatumn's; Such perfumes; med'cines; quintessences, &amp;c. And such a Mistresse of behauiour; She knowes, from the Dukes daughter, to the Doxey, What is their due iust: and no more! Fit. O Sir! You please me i'this, more then mine owne greatnesse. Where is shee? Let vs haue her. Mer. By your patience, We must vse meanes; cast how to be acquainted— Fit. Good, Sr, about it. Mer. We must think how, first. Fit. O! I doe not loue to tarry for a thing, When I haue a mind to't. You doe not know me. If you doe offer it. Mer. Your wife must send Some pretty token to her, with a complement, And pray to be receiu'd in her good graces, All the great Ladies do't, Fit. She shall, she shall, What were it best to be? Mer. Some little toy, I would not haue it any great matter, Sir: A Diamant ring, of forty or fifty pound, Would doe it handsomely: and be a gift Fit for your wife to send, and her to take. Fit. I'll goe, and tell my wife on't, streight. Mer. Why this Fitz-dottrel goes out. Is well! The clothes we'haue now: But, where's this Lady? If we could get a witty boy, now, Ingine; That were an excellent cracke. I could instruct him, To the true height. For any thing takes this dottrel. Ing. Why, Sir your best will be one o'the players! Mer. No, there's no trusting them. They'll talke on't, And tell their Poets. Ing. What if they doe? the iest will brooke the Stage. But, there be some of 'hem Are very honest Lads. There's Dicke Robinson A very pretty fellow, and comes often To a Gentlemans chamber, a friends of mine. We had The merriest supper of it there, one night, The Gentlemans Land-lady invited him To'a Gossips feast, Now, he Sir brought Dick Robinson, Drest like a Lawyers wife, amongst 'hem all; (I lent him cloathes) but, to see him behaue it; And lay the law; and carue; and drinke vnto 'hem; And then talke baudy: and send frolicks! o! It would haue burst your buttons, or not left you A seame. Mer. They say hee's an ingenious youth! Ing. O Sir! and dresses himselfe, the best! beyond Forty o'your very Ladies! did you ne'r see him? Mer. No, I do seldome see those toyes. But thinke you, That we may haue him? Ing. Sir, the young Gentleman I tell you of, can command him. Shall I attempt it? Enters againe. Mer. Yes, doe it. Fit. S'light, I cannot get my wife To part with a ring, on any termes: and yet, The sollen Monkey has two. Mer. It were 'gainst reason, That you should vrge it; Sir, send to a Gold-smith, Let not her lose by't? Fit. How do's she lose by't? Is't not for her? Mer. Make it your owne bounty, It will ha' the better successe; what is a matter Of fifty pound to you, Sr. Fit. I'haue but a hundred Pieces, to shew here; that I would not breake— Mer. You shall ha' credit, Sir. I'll send a ticket Vnto my Gold-smith. Heer, my man comes too, Traines enters. To carry it fitly. How now, Traines? What birds? Tra. Your Cousin Euer-ill met me, and has beat mee, Because I would not tell him where you were: I think he has dogd me to the house too. Fit. Well— You shall goe out at the back-doore, then, Traines. You must get Guilt-head hither, by some meanes: Tra. 'Tis impossible! Fit. Tell him, we haue venison, I'll g' him a piece, and send his wife a Phesant. Tra. A Forrest moues not, till that forty pound, Yo' had of him, last, be pai'd. He keepes more stirre, For that same petty summe, then for your bond Of sixe; and Statute of eight hundred! Fit. Tell him Wee'll hedge in that. Cry vp Fitz-dottrell to him, Double his price: Make him a man of mettall. Tra. That will not need, his bond is currant inough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. III. Scene. I. Gvilt-head. Plvtarchvs. [Gvi.] All this is to make you a Gentleman: I'll haue you learne, Sonne. Wherefore haue I plac'd you With Sr. Poul Either-side, but to haue so much Law To keepe your owne? Besides, he is a Iustice, Here i'the Towne; and dwelling, Sonne, with him, You shall learne that in a yeere, shall be worth twenty Of hauing stay'd you at Oxford, or at Cambridge, Or sending you to the Innes of Court, or France. I am call'd for now in haste, by Master Meere-craft To trust Master Fitz-dottrel, a good man: I'haue inquir'd him, eighteene hundred a yeere, (His name is currant) for a diamant ring Of forty, shall not be worth thirty (thats gain'd) And this is to make you a Gentleman! Plv. O, but good father, you trust too much! Gvi. Boy, boy, We liue, by finding fooles out, to be trusted. Our shop-bookes are our pastures, our corn-grounds, We lay 'hem op'n, for them to come into: And when wee haue 'hem there, wee driue 'hem vp In t'one of our two Pounds, the Compters, streight, And this is to make you a Gentleman! Wee Citizens neuer trust, but wee doe coozen: For, if our debtors pay, wee coozen them; And if they doe not, then we coozen our selues. But that's a hazard euery one must runne, That hopes to make his Sonne a Gentleman! Plv. I doe not wish to be one, truely, Father. In a descent, or two, wee come to be Iust 'itheir state, fit to be coozend, like 'hem. And I had rather ha' tarryed i'your trade: For, since the Gentry scorne the Citty so much, Me thinkes we should in time, holding together, And matching in our owne tribes, as they say, Haue got an Act of Common Councell, for it, That we might coozen them out of rerum natura. Gvi. I, if we had an Act first to forbid The marrying of our wealthy heyres vnto 'hem: And daughters, with such lauish portions. That confounds all. Plv. And makes a Mungril breed, Father. And when they haue your money, then they laugh at you: Or kick you downe the stayres. I cannot abide 'hem. I would faine haue 'hem coozen'd, but not trusted. Scene. II. Mere-craft. Gvilt-head. Fitz-dottrell. Plvtarchvs. [Mer.] O, is he come! I knew he would not faile me. Welcome, good Guilt-head, I must ha' you doe A noble Gentleman, a courtesie, here: In a mere toy (some pretty Ring, or Iewell) Of fifty, or threescore pound (Make it a hundred, And hedge in the last forty, that I owe you, And your owne price for the Ring) He's a good man, Sr, And you may hap' see him a great one! Hee, Is likely to bestow hundreds, and thousands, Wi'you; if you can humour him. A great prince He will be shortly. What doe you say? Gvi. In truth, Sir I cannot. 'T has beene a long vacation with vs, Fit. Of what, I pray thee? of wit? or honesty? Those are your Citizens long vacations. Plv. Good Father do not trust 'hem. Mer. Nay, Thom. Guilt-head. Hee will not buy a courtesie and begge it: Hee'll rather pay, then pray. If you doe for him, You must doe cheerefully. His credit, Sir, Is not yet prostitute! Who's this? thy sonne? A pretty youth, what's his name? Plv. Plutarchus, Sir. Mer. Plutarchus! How came that about? Gvi. That yeere Sr, That I begot him, I bought Plutarch's liues, And fell s' in loue with the booke, as I call'd my sonne By 'his name; In hope he should be like him: And write the liues of our great men! Mer. I'the City? And you do breed him, there? Gvi. His minde, Sir, lies Much to that way. Mer. Why, then, he is i'the right way. Gvi. But, now, I had rather get him a good wife, And plant him i'the countrey; there to vse The blessing I shall leaue him: Mer. Out vpon't! And lose the laudable meanes, thou hast at home, heere, T'aduance, and make him a young Alderman? Buy him a Captaines place, for shame; and let him Into the world, early, and with his plume, And Scarfes, march through Cheapside, or along Cornehill, And by the vertue'of those, draw downe a wife There from a windo', worth ten thousand pound! Get him the posture booke, and's leaden men, To set vpon a table, 'gainst his Mistresse Chance to come by, that hee may draw her in, And shew her Finsbury battells. Gvi. I haue plac'd him With Iustice Eytherside, to get so much law— Mer. As thou hast conscience. Come, come, thou dost wrong Pretty Plutarchus, who had not his name, For nothing: but was borne to traine the youth Of London, in the military truth— That way his Genius lies. My Cousin Euerill! Scene. IIJ. Ever-ill. Plvtarchvs. Gvilt-head. Mere-craft. Fitzdottrell. [Ev.] O, are you heere, Sir? 'pray you let vs whisper. Plv. Father, deare Father, trust him if you loue mee. Gvi. Why, I doe meane it, boy; but, what I doe, Must not come easily from mee: Wee must deale With Courtiers, boy, as Courtiers deale with vs. If I haue a Businesse there, with any of them, Why, I must wait, I'am sure on't, Son: and though My Lord dispatch me, yet his worshipfull man— Will keepe me for his sport, a moneth, or two, To shew mee with my fellow Cittizens. I must make his traine long, and full, one quarter; And helpe the spectacle of his greatnesse. There, Nothing is done at once, but iniuries, boy: And they come head-long! all their good turnes moue not, Or very slowly Plv. Yet sweet father, trust him. Gvi. VVell, I will thinke. Ev. Come, you must do't, Sir. I'am vndone else, and your Lady Tayle-bush Has sent for mee to dinner, and my cloaths Are all at pawne. I had sent out this morning, Before I heard you were come to towne, some twenty Of my epistles, and no one returne— Mere-craft tells him of his faults. Mer. VVhy, I ha'told you o'this. This comes of wearing Scarlet, gold lace, and cut-works! your fine gartring! VVith your blowne roses, Cousin! and your eating Phesant, and Godwit, here in London! haunting The Globes, and Mermaides! wedging in with Lords, Still at the table! and affecting lechery, In veluet! where could you ha'contented your selfe VVith cheese, salt-butter, and a pickled hering, I'the Low-countries; there worne cloth, and fustian! Beene satisfied with a leape o' your Host's daughter, In garrison, a wench of a stoter! or, Your Sutlers wife, i'the leaguer, of two blanks! You neuer, then, had runne vpon this flat, To write your letters missiue, and send out Your priuy seales, that thus haue frighted off All your acquintance; that they shun you at distance, VVorse, then you do the Bailies! Ev. Pox vpon you. Hee repines, I come not to you for counsell, I lacke money. Mer. You doe not thinke, what you owe me already? Ev. I? They owe you, that meane to pay you. I'll besworne, I neuer meant it. Come, you will proiect, and threatens him. I shall vndoe your practice, for this moneth else: You know mee. Mer. I, yo' are a right sweet nature! Ev. Well, that's all one! Mer. You'll leaue this Empire, one day? You will not euer haue this tribute payd, Your scepter o' the sword? Ev. Tye vp your wit, Doe, and prouoke me not— Mer. Will you, Sir, helpe, To what I shall prouoke another for you? Ev. I cannot tell; try me: I thinke I am not So vtterly, of an ore vn-to-be-melted, But I can doe my selfe good, on occasions. They ioyne. Mer. Strike in then, for your part. Mr. Fitz-dottrel If I transgresse in point of manners, afford mee Your best construction; I must beg my freedome Mere-craft pretends businesse. From your affayres, this day. Fit. How, Sr. Mer. It is. In succour of this Gentlemans occasions, My kins-man— Fit. You'll not do me that affront, Sr. Mer. I am sory you should so interpret it, But, Sir, it stands vpon his being inuested In a new office, hee has stood for, long: Mere-craft describes the office of Dependancy. Master of the Dependances! A place Of my proiection too, Sir, and hath met Much opposition; but the State, now, see's That great necessity of it, as after all Their writing, and their speaking, against Duells, They haue erected it. His booke is drawne— For, since, there will be differences, daily, 'Twixt Gentlemen; and that the roaring manner Is growne offensiue; that those few, we call The ciuill men o'the sword, abhorre the vapours; They shall refer now, hither, for their processe; And such as trespasse 'gainst the rule of Court; Are to be fin'd— Fit. In troth, a pretty place! Mer. A kinde of arbitrary Court 'twill be, Sir. Fit. I shall haue matter for it, I beleeue, Ere it be long: I had a distast. Mer. But now, Sir, My learned councell, they must haue a feeling, They'll part, Sir, with no bookes, without the hand-gout Be oyld, and I must furnish. If't be money, To me streight. I am Mine, Mint and Exchequer, To supply all. What is't? a hundred pound? Eve. No, th'Harpey, now, stands on a hundred pieces. Mer. Why, he must haue 'hem, if he will. To morrow, Sir, Will equally serue your occasion's,— And therefore, let me obtaine, that you will yeeld To timing a poore Gentlemans distresses, In termes of hazard.— Fit. By no meanes! Mer. I must Get him this money, and will.— Fit. Sir, I protest, I'd rather stand engag'd for it my selfe: Then you should leaue mee. Mer. O good Sr. do you thinke So coursely of our manners, that we would, For any need of ours, be prest to take it: Though you be pleas'd to offer it. Fit. Why, by heauen, I meane it! Mer. I can neuer beleeue lesse. But wee, Sir, must preserue our dignity, Hee offers to be gone. As you doe publish yours. By your faire leaue, Sir. Fit. As I am a Gentleman, if you doe offer To leaue mee now, or if you doe refuse mee, I will not thinke you loue mee. Mer. Sir, I honour you. And with iust reason, for these noble notes, Of the nobility, you pretend too! But, Sir— I would know, why? a motiue (he a stranger) You should doe this? Eve. (You'll mar all with your finenesse) Fit. Why, that's all one, if 'twere, Sir, but my fancy. But I haue a Businesse, that perhaps I'd haue Brought to his office. Mer. O, Sit! I haue done, then; If hee can be made profitable, to you. Fit. Yes, and it shall be one of my ambitions To haue it the first Businesse? May I not? Eve. So you doe meane to make't, a perfect Businesse. Fit. Nay, I'll doe that, assure you: shew me once. Mer. Sr, it concernes, the first be a perfect Businesse, For his owne honour! Eve. I, and th'reputation Too, of my place. Fit. Why, why doe I take this course, else? I am not altogether, an Asse, good Gentlemen, Wherefore should I consult you? doe you thinke? To make a song on't? How's your manner? tell vs. Mer. Doe, satisfie him: giue him the whole course. Eve. First, by request, or otherwise, you offer Your Businesse to the Court: wherein you craue: The iudgement of the Master and the Assistants. Fit. Well, that's done, now, what doe you vpon it? Eve. We streight Sr, haue recourse to the spring-head; Visit the ground; and, so disclose the nature: If it will carry, or no. If wee doe finde, By our proportions it is like to proue A sullen, and blacke Bus'nesse That it be Incorrigible; and out of, treaty; then, We file it, a Dependance! Fit. So 'tis fil'd. What followes? I doe loue the order of these things. Eve. We then aduise the party, if he be A man of meanes, and hauings, that forth-with, He settle his estate: if not, at least That he pretend it. For, by that, the world Takes notice, that it now is a Dependance. And this we call, Sir, Publication. Fit. Very sufficient! After Publication, now? Eve. Then we grant out our Processe, which is diuers; Eyther by Chartell, Sir, or ore-tenus, Wherein the Challenger, and Challengee Or (with your Spaniard) your Prouocador, And Prouocado, haue their seuerall courses— Fit. I haue enough on't! for an hundred pieces? Yes, for two hundred, vnder-write me, doe. Your man will take my bond? Mer. That he will, sure, But, these same Citizens, they are such sharks! He whispers Fitz-dottrell aside. There's an old debt of forty, I ga' my word For one is runne away, to the Bermudas, And he will hooke in that, or he wi' not doe. Fit. Why, let him. That and the ring, and a hundred pieces, Will all but make two hundred? Mer. No, no more, Sir. And then Guilt-head What ready Arithmetique you haue? doe you heare? A pretty mornings worke for you, this? Do it, You shall ha' twenty pound on't. Gvi. Twenty pieces? Plv. (Good Father, do't) Mer. You will hooke still? well, Shew vs your ring. You could not ha' done this, now With gentlenesse, at first, wee might ha' thank'd you? But groane, and ha' you courtesies come from you Like a hard stoole, and stinke? A man may draw Your teeth out easier, then your money? Come, Were little Guilt-head heere, no better a nature, Hee pulls Plutarchus by the lips. I should ne'r loue him, that could pull his lips off, now! Was not thy mother a Gentlewoman? Plv. Yes, Sir. Mer. And went to the Court at Christmas, and St. Georges-tide? And lent the Lords-men, chaines? Plv. Of gold, and pearle, Sr. Mer. I knew, thou must take, after some body! Thou could'st not be else. This was no shop-looke! I'll ha' thee Captaine Guilt-head, and march vp, And take in Pimlico,, and kill the bush, At euery tauerne! Thou shalt haue a wife, If smocks will mount, boy. How now? you ha'there now Some Bristo-stone, or Cornish counterfeit He turnes to old Guilt-head. You'ld put vpon vs. Gvi. No, Sir, I assure you: Looke on his luster! hee will speake himselfe! I'le gi'you leaue to put him i' the Mill, H'is no great, large stone, but a true Paragon, H'has all his corners, view him well. Mer. H'is yellow. Gvi. Vpo' my faith, Sr, o'the right black-water, And very deepe! H'is set without a foyle, too. Here's one o'the yellow-water, I'll sell cheape. Mer. And what do you valew this, at? thirty pound? Gvi. No, Sir, he cost me forty, ere he was set. Mer. Turnings, you meane? I know your Equiuocks: You'are growne the better Fathers of 'hem o'late. Well, where't must goe, 'twill be iudg'd, and, therefore, Looke you't be right. You shall haue fifty pound for't. Now to Fitz-dottrel. Not a deneer more! And, because you would Haue things dispatch'd, Sir, I'll goe presently, Inquire out this Lady. If you thinke good, Sir. Hauing an hundred pieces ready, you may Part with those, now, to serue my kinsmans turnes, That he may wait vpon you, anon, the freer; And take 'hem when you ha' seal'd, againe, of Guilt-head. Fit. I care not if I do! Mer. And dispatch all, Together. Fit. There, th'are iust: a hundred pieces! I' ha'told 'hem ouer, twice a day, these two moneths. Hee turnes 'hem out together. And Euerill and hee fall to share. Mer. Well, go, and seale then, Sr, make your returne As speedy as you can. Eve. Come gi' mee. Mer. Soft, Sir, Eve. Mary, and faire too, then. I'll no delaying, Sir.

We must moue, Madame, in order, by degrees: not iump. Tay. Why, there was Sr. Iohn Monie-man could iump A Businesse quickely. Mer. True, hee had great friends, But, because some, sweete Madame, can leape ditches, Wee must not all shunne to goe ouer bridges. The harder parts, I make account are done: He flatters her. Now, 'tis referr'd. You are infinitly bound Vnto the Ladies, they ha' so cri'd it vp! Tay. Doe they like it then? Mer. They ha' sent the Spanish-Lady, To gratulate with you— Tay. I must send 'hem thankes And some remembrances. Mer. That you must, and visit 'hem. Where's Ambler? Tay. Lost, to day, we cannot heare of him. Mer. Not Madam? Tay. No in good faith. They say he lay not At home, to night. And here has fall'n a Businesse Betweene your Cousin, and Master Manly, has Vnquieted vs all. Mer. So I heare, Madame. Pray you how was it? Tay. Troth, it but appeares Ill o'your Kinsmans part. You may haue heard, That Manly is a sutor to me, I doubt not: Mer. I guess'd it, Madame. Tay. And it seemes, he trusted Your Cousin to let fall some faire reports Of him vnto mee. Mer. Which he did! Tay. So farre From it, as hee came in, and tooke him rayling Against him. Mer. How!

You are too much affected with it. Man. I cannot Madame, but thinke on't for th'iniustice. Tay. Sir, His kinsman here is sorry. Mer. Not I, Madam, I am no kin to him, wee but call Cousins, Mere-craft denies him. And if wee were, Sir, I haue no relation Vnto his crimes. Man. You are not vrged with 'hem. I can accuse, Sir, none but mine owne iudgement, For though it were his crime, so to betray mee: I am sure, 'twas more mine owne, at all to trust him. But he, therein, did vse but his old manners, And sauour strongly what hee was before. Tay. Come, he will change! Man. Faith, I must neuer think it. Nor were it reason in mee to expect That for my sake, hee should put off a nature Hee suck'd in with his milke. It may be Madam, Deceiuing trust, is all he has to trust to: If so, I shall be loath, that any hope Of mine, should bate him of his meanes. Tay. Yo'are sharp, Sir. This act may make him honest! Man. If he were To be made honest, by an act of Parliament, I should not alter, i'my faith of him. Tay. Eyther-side! She spies the Lady Eyther-side.

Mer. No, but because my Lady, Nam'd him my kinsman; I would satisfie you, What I thinke of him: and pray you, vpon it To iudge mee! Man. So I doe: that ill mens friendship, Is as vnfaithfull, as themselues. Tay. Doe you heare? Ha'you a Businesse about Tooth-picks? Mer. Yes, Madame. Did I ne'r tell't you? I meant to haue offer'd it Your Lady-ship, on the perfecting the pattent. Tay. How is't! Mer. For seruing the whole state with Tooth-picks; The Proiect for Tooth-picks. Somewhat an intricate Businesse to discourse) but— I shew, how much the Subiect is abus'd, First, in that one commodity? then what diseases, And putrefactions in the gummes are bred, By those are made 'of' adultrate, and false wood? My plot, for reformation of these, followes. To haue all Tooth-picks, brought vnto an office, There seal'd; and such as counterfait 'hem, mulcted. And last, for venting 'hem to haue a booke Printed, to teach their vse, which euery childe Shall haue throughout the kingdome, that can read, And learne to picke his teeth by.

Here is a noble Lady, Madame, come, From your great friends, at Court, to see your Ladi-ship: And haue the honour of your acquaintance. Tay. Sir. She do's vs honour. Wit. Pray you, say to her Ladiship, Excuses him selfe for not kissing. It is the manner of Spaine, to imbrace onely, Neuer to kisse. She will excuse the custome! Tay. Your vse of it is law. Please you, sweete, Madame, To take a seate. Wit. Yes, Madame. I'haue had The fauour, through a world of faire report To know your vertues, Madame; and in that Name, haue desir'd the happinesse of presenting My seruice to your Ladiship! Tay. Your loue, Madame, I must not owne it else. Wit. Both are due, Madame, To your great vndertakings. Tay. Great? In troth, Madame, They are my friends, that thinke 'hem any thing: If I can doe my sexe (by 'hem) any seruice, I'haue my ends, Madame. Wit. And they are noble ones, That make a multitude beholden, Madame: The common-wealth of Ladies, must acknowledge from you. Eit. Except some enuious, Madame. Wit. Yo'are right in that, Madame, Of which race, I encountred some but lately. Who ('t seemes) haue studyed reasons to discredit Your businesse. Tay. How, sweet Madame. Wit. Nay, the parties Wi'not be worth your pause—Most ruinous things, Madame, That haue put off all hope of being recouer'd To a degree of handsomenesse. Tay. But their reasons, Madame? I would faine heare. Wit. Some Madame, I remember. They say, that painting quite destroyes the face— Eit. O, that's an old one, Madame. Wit. There are new ones, too. Corrupts the breath; hath left so little sweetnesse In kissing, as 'tis now vs'd, but for fashion: And shortly will be taken for a punishment. Decayes the fore-teeth, that should guard the tongue; And suffers that runne riot euer-lasting! And (which is worse) some Ladies when they meete Manly begins to know him. Cannot be merry, and laugh, but they doe spit In one anothers faces! Man. I should know This voyce, and face too: VVit. Then they say, 'tis dangerous To all the falne, yet well dispos'd Mad-dames, That are industrious, and desire to earne Their liuing with their sweate! For any distemper Of heat, and motion, may displace the colours; And if the paint once runne about their faces, Twenty to one, they will appeare so ill-fauour'd, Their seruants run away, too, and leaue the pleasure Imperfect, and the reckoning als' vnpay'd. Eit. Pox, these are Poets reasons. Tay. Some old Lady That keepes a Poet, has deuis'd these scandales. Eit. Faith we must haue the Poets banish'd, Madame, As Master Either-side saies. Mer. Master Fitz dottrel? And his wife: where? Madame, the Duke of Drown'd-land, That will be shortly. VVit. Is this my Lord? Mer. The same. Scene IV. Fitz-dottrel. Mistresse Fitz-dottrell. Pvg. to them. [Man.] Your seruant, Madame! VVit. How now? Friend? offended, Wittipol whispers with Manly. That I haue found your haunt here? Man. No, but wondring At your strange fashion'd venture, hither. VVit. It is To shew you what they are, you so pursue. Man. I thinke 'twill proue a med'cine against marriage; To know their manners. VVit. Stay, and profit then. Mer. The Lady, Madame, whose Prince has brought her, here, To be instructed. VVit. Please you sit with vs, Lady. Hee presents Mistresse Fitz-dottrel. Mer. That's Lady-President. Fit. A goodly woman! I cannot see the ring, though. Mer. Sir, she has it. Tay. But, Madame, these are very feeble reasons! Wit. So I vrg'd Madame, that the new complexion, Now to come forth, in name o' your Ladiship's fucus, Had no ingredient— Tay. But I durst eate, I assure you. Wit. So do they, in Spaine. Tay. Sweet Madam be so liberall, To giue vs some o' your Spanish Fucuses! VVit. They are infinit Madame. Tay. So I heare, they haue VVater of Gourdes, of Radish, the white Beanes, Flowers of Glasse, of Thistles, Rose-marine. Raw Honey, Mustard-seed, and Bread dough-bak'd, The crums o'bread, Goats-milke, and whites of Egges, Campheere, and Lilly-roots, the fat of Swannes, Marrow of Veale, white Pidgeons, and pine-kernells, The seedes of Nettles, perse'line, and hares gall. Limons, thin-skind— Eit. How, her Ladiship has studied Al excellent things! VVit. But ordinary, Madame. No, the true rarities, are th'Aluagada, And Argentata of Queene Isabella! Tay. I, what are their ingredients, gentle Madame? Wit. Your Allum Scagliola, or Pol-dipedra; And Zuccarino; Turpentine of Abezzo. VVash'd in nine waters: Soda di leuante, Or your Ferne ashes; Beniamin di gotta; Grasso di serpe; Porcelletto marino; Oyles of Lentisco; Zucche Mugia; make The admirable Vernish for the face, Giues the right luster; but two drops rub'd on VVith a piece of scarlet, makes a Lady of sixty Looke at sixteen. But, aboue all, the water Of the white Hen, of the Lady Estifanias! Tay. O, I, that same, good Madame, I haue heard of: How is it done? VVit. Madame, you take your Hen, Plume it, and skin it, cleanse it o'the inwards: Then chop it, bones and all: adde to foure ounces Of Carrnuacins, Pipitas, Sope of Cyprus, Make the decoction, streine it. Then distill it, And keepe it in your galley-pot well, glidder'd: Three drops preserues from wrinkles, warts, spots, moles, Blemish, or Sun-burnings, and keepes the skin In decimo sexto, euer bright, and smooth, As any looking-glasse; and indeed, is call'd The Virgins milke for the face, Oglio reale; A Ceruse, neyther cold or heat, will hurt; And mixt with oyle of myrrhe, and the red Gilli flower Call'd Cataputia; and flowers of Rouistico; Makes the best muta, or dye of the whole world. Tay. Deare Madame, will you let vs be familiar? Wit. Your Ladiships seruant. Mer. How do you like her. Fit. Admirable! Hee is iealous about his ring, and Mere-craft deliuers it. But, yet, I cannot see the ring. Pvg. Sir. Mer. I must Deliuer it, or marre all. This foole's so iealous. Madame—Sir, weare this ring, and pray you take knowledge, 'Twas sent you by his wife. And giue her thanks, Doe not you dwindle, Sir, beare vp. Pvg. I thanke you, Sir, Tay. But for the manner of Spaine! Sweet, Madame, let vs Be bold, now we are in: Are all the Ladies, There, i'the fashion? VVit. None but Grandee's, Madame, O' the clasp'd traine, which may be worne at length, too, Or thus, vpon my arme. Tay. And doe they weare Cioppino's all? VVit. If they be drest in punto, Madame. Eit. Guilt as those are? madame? Wit. Of Goldsmiths work, madame; And set with diamants: and their Spanish pumps Of perfum'd leather. Tai. I should thinke it hard To go in 'hem madame. Wit. At the first, it is, madame. Tai. Do you neuer fall in'hem? Wit. Neuer. Ei. I sweare, I should Six times an houre. Wit. But you haue men at hand, still, To helpe you, if you fall? Eit. Onely one, madame, The Guardo-duennas, such a little old man, As this. Eit. Alas! hee can doe nothing! this! Wit. I'll tell you, madame, I saw i'the Court of Spaine once, A Lady fall i'the Kings sight, along. And there shee lay, flat spred, as an Vmbrella, Her hoope here crack'd; no man durst reach a hand To helpe her, till the Guarda-duenn'as came, VVho is the person onel'allow'd to touch A Lady there: and he but by this finger. Eit. Ha' they no seruants, madame, there? nor friends? Wit. An Escudero, or so madame, that wayts Vpon 'hem in another Coach, at distance, And when they walke, or daunce, holds by a hand-kercher, Neuer presumes to touch 'hem. Eit. This's sciruy! And a forc'd grauity! I doe not like it. I like our owne much better. Tay. 'Tis more French, And Courtly ours. Eit. And tasts more liberty. VVe may haue our doozen of visiters, at once, Make loue t'vs. Tay. And before our husbands? Eit. Husband? As I am honest, Tayle-bush I doe thinke If no body should loue mee, but my poore husband, I should e'n hang my selfe. Tay. Fortune forbid, wench: So faire a necke should haue so foule a neck-lace, Eit. 'Tis true, as I am handsome! Wit. I receiu'd, Lady, A token from you, which I would not bee Rude to refuse, being your first remembrance. Fit. (O, I am satisfied now! Mer. Do you see it, Sir.) Wit. But since you come, to know me, neerer, Lady, I'll begge the honour, you will weare it for mee, Wittipol giues it Mistresse Fitz-dottrel. Mere-craft murmures, He is satisfied, now he sees it. It must be so. Mrs. Fit. Sure I haue heard this tongue. Mer. What do you meane, Sr? Wit. Would you ha'me mercenary? We'll recompence it anon, in somewhat else, Fit. I doe not loue to be gull'd, though in a toy. VVife, doe you heare? yo' are come into the Schole, wife, VVhere you may learne, I doe perceiue it, any thing! How to be fine, or faire, or great, or proud, Or what you will, indeed, wife; heere 'tis taught. And I am glad on't, that you may not say, Another day, when honours come vpon you, You wanted meanes.

Nay, so I presuppose him. Wit. And they are fitter Managers too, Sir, but I would haue 'hem call'd Our Escudero's. Fit. Good. Wit.

But shee will ne'r be capable, shee is not So much as comming, Madame; I know not how She loses all her opportunities With hoping to be forc'd.

He then had had no barren head. You draw him too much, in troth, Sir. Fit. I must walke With the French sticke, like an old vierger for you, The Diuell prayes. Pvg.

O, if my Ambler had beene here! Eit. I, Madame; You talke of a man, where is there such another? Wit. Mr. Deuile, put case, one of my Ladies, heere, Had a fine brach: and would imploy you forth To treate 'bout a conuenient match for her. What would you obserue? Pvg. The color, and the size, Madame. Wit. And nothing else? Fit. The Moon, you calfe, the Moone! Wit. I, and the Signe. Tai. Yes, and receits for pronenesse. Wit. Then when the Puppies came, what would you doe? Pvg. Get their natiuities cast! Wit. This's wel. What more? Pvg. Consult the Almanack-man which would be least? Which cleaneliest? Wit. And which silentest? This's wel, madame! Wit. And while she were with puppy? Pvg. Walke her out, And ayre her euery morning! Wit. Very good! And be industrious to kill her fleas? Pvg. Yes! Wit. He will make a pretty proficient. Pvg. Who, Comming from Hell, could looke for such Catechising? The Diuell is an Asse. I doe acknowledge it. Fitz-dottrel admires Wittipol. Fit. The top of woman! All her sexe in abstract! I loue her, to each syllable, falls from her. Tai. Good madame giue me leaue to goe aside with him! And try him a little! The Diuell praies again. Wit. Do, and I'll with-draw, Madame, VVith this faire Lady: read to her, the while. Tai. Come, Sr. Pvg. Deare Chiefe, relieue me, or I perish. Wit. Lady, we'll follow. You are not iealous Sir?

Faith, but I did, Sr. And vpon better thought, not without reason! He being chiefe Officer, might ha'tane it ill, else, As a Contempt against his Place, and that In time Sir, ha' drawne on another Dependance. No, I did finde him in good terms, and ready To doe me any seruice. Mer. So he said, to you? But Sr, you do not know him. Fit. VVhy, I presum'd Because this bus'nesse of my wiues, requir'd mee, I could not ha' done better: And hee told Me, that he would goe presently to your Councell, A Knight, here, i'the Lane— Mer. Yes, Iustice Either-side. Fit. And get the Feoffment drawne, with a letter of Atturney, For liuerie and seisen! Mer. That I knowe's the course. But Sir, you meane not to make him Feoffee? Fit. Nay, that I'll pause on! Mer. How now little Pit-fall Pit. Your Cousin Master Euer-ill, would come in— But he would know if Master Manly were heere. Mere-craft whispers against him. Mer. No, tell him, if he were, I ha'made his peace! Hee's one, Sir, has no State, and a man knowes not, How such a trust may tempt him. Fit. I conceiue you. Eve. Sr. this same deed is done here. Mer. Pretty Plutarchus? Art thou come with it? and has Sir Paul view'd it? Plv. His hand is to the draught. Mer. VVill you step in, Sr. And read it? Fit. Yes. Eve. I pray you a word wi'you. Eueril whispers against Mere-craft. Sir Paul Eitherside will'd mee gi' you caution, VVhom you did make Feoffee: for 'tis the trust O'your whole State: and though my Cousin heere Be a worthy Gentleman, yet his valour has At the tall board bin question'd; and we hold Any man so impeach'd, of doubtfull honesty! I will not iustifie this; but giue it you To make your profit of it: if you vtter it, I can forsweare it! Fit. I beleeue you, and thanke you, Sir. Scene. VI. VVittipol. Mistresse Fitz-dottrel. Manly. Mere-craft. [Wit.] Be not afraid, sweet Lady: yo'are trusted To loue, not violence here; I am no rauisher, But one, whom you, by your faire trust againe, May of a seruant make a most true friend. Mrs. Fi. And such a one I need, but not this way: Sir, I confesse me to you, the meere manner Of your attempting mee, this morning tooke mee, And I did hold m'inuention, and my manners, Were both engag'd, to giue it a requitall; But not vnto your ends: my hope was then, (Though interrupted, ere it could be vtter'd) That whom I found the Master of such language, That braine and spirit, for such an enterprise, Could not, but if those succours were demanded To a right vse, employ them vertuously! And make that profit of his noble parts, Which they would yeeld. Sr, you haue now the ground, To exercise them in: I am a woman; That cannot speake more wretchednesse of my selfe, Then you can read; match'd to a masse of folly; That euery day makes haste to his owne ruine; The wealthy portion, that I brought him, spent; And (through my friends neglect) no ioynture made me. My fortunes standing in this precipice, 'Tis Counsell that I want, and honest aides: And in this name, I need you, for a friend! Neuer in any other; for his ill, Must not make me, Sr, worse. Man. O friend! forsake not Manly, conceal'd this while, shews himselfe. The braue occasion, vertue offers you, To keepe you innocent: I haue fear'd for both; And watch'd you, to preuent the ill I fear'd. But, since the weaker side hath so assur'd mee, Let not the stronger fall by his owne vice, Or be the lesse a friend, cause vertue needs him. Wit. Vertue shall neuer aske my succours twice; Most friend, most man; your Counsells are commands: Lady, I can loue goodnes in you, more Then I did Beauty; and doe here intitle Your vertue, to the power, vpon a life You shall engage in any fruitfull seruice, Euen to forfeit. Mer. Madame: Do you heare, Sir, We haue another leg-strain'd for this Dottrel. Mere-craft takes Wittipol aside, &amp; moues a proiect for himselfe. He' ha's a quarrell to carry, and ha's caus'd A deed of Feoffment, of his whole estate To be drawne yonder; h'ha'st within: And you, Onely, he meanes to make Feoffee. H'is falne So desperatly enamour'd on you, and talkes Most like a mad-man: you did neuer heare A Phrentick, so in loue with his owne fauour! Now, you doe know, 'tis of no validity In your name, as you stand; Therefore aduise him To put in me. (h'is come here:) You shall share Sir. Scene VIJ. VVittipol. Mistresse Fitz-Dottrel. Manly.

No Lady; you must not know it: yet, you must too. For the trust of it, and the fame indeed, Which else were lost me. I would vse your name, But in a Feoffment: make my whole estate Ouer vnto you: a trifle, a thing of nothing, Some eighteene hundred. Wit. Alas! I vnderstand not Those things Sir. I am a woman, and most loath, To embarque my selfe— Fit. You will not slight me, Madame? Wit. Nor you'll not quarrell me? Fit. No, sweet Madame, I haue Already a dependance; for which cause I doe this: let me put you in, deare Madame, Hee hopes to be the man. I may be fairely kill'd. Wit. You haue your friends, Sir, About you here, for choice. Eve. She tells you right, Sir. Fit. Death, if she doe, what do I care for that? Say, I would haue her tell me wrong. Wit. Why, Sir, If for the trust, you'll let me haue the honor To name you one. Fit. Nay, you do me the honor, Madame: She designes Manly. Who is't? Wit. This Gentleman: Fit. O, no, sweet Madame, H'is friend to him, with whom I ha' the dependance. Wit. Who might he bee? Fit. One Wittipol: do you know him? Wit. Alas Sir, he, a toy: This Gentleman A friend to him? no more then I am Sir! Fit. But will your Ladyship vndertake that, Madame? Wit. Yes, and what else, for him, you will engage me. Fit. What is his name? VVit. His name is Eustace Manly. Fit. VVhence do's he write himselfe? VVit. of Middle-sex, Esquire. Fit. Say nothing, Madame.

Be silent then: “falshood commends not truth. Plv. You do deliuer this, Sir, as your deed. To th'vse of Mr. Manly? Fit. Yes: and Sir— VVhen did you see yong Wittipol? I am ready, For processe now; Sir, this is Publication. He shall heare from me, he would needes be courting My wife, Sir. Man. Yes: So witnesseth his Cloake there. Fitz-dottrel is suspicious of Manly still. Fit. Nay good Sir,—Madame, you did vndertake— VVit. VVhat? Fit. That he was not Wittipols friend. VVit. I heare Sr. no confession of it. Fit. O she know's not; Now I remember, Madame! This young Wittipol, VVould ha' debauch'd my wife, and made me Cuckold, Through a casement; he did fly her home To mine owne window: but I think I sou't him, And rauish'd her away, out of his pownces. I ha' sworne to ha'him by the eares: I feare The toy, wi' not do me right. VVit. No? that were pitty! VVhat right doe you aske, Sir? Here he is will do't you? Wittipol discouers himselfe. Fit. Ha? Wittipol? VVit. I Sir, no more Lady now, Nor Spaniard! Man. No indeed, 'tis Wittipol. Fit. Am I the thing I fear'd? VVit. A Cuckold? No Sir, But you were late in possibility, I'll tell you so much. Man. But your wife's too vertuous! VVit. VVee'll see her Sir, at home, and leaue you here, To be made Duke o' Shore-ditch with a proiect. Fit. Theeues, rauishers. VVit.

Neither: that shall be kept for your wiues good, VVho will know, better how to vse it. Fit. Ha' To feast you with my land? VVit.

Good fellow Pit-fall, Tel Mr. Mere-craft, I intreat a word with him. Pitfall goes out. This most vnlucky accident will goe neare To be the losse o' my place; I am in doubt! Mer. VVith me? what say you Mr Ambler? Amb. Sir, I would beseech your worship stand betweene Me, and my Ladies displeasure, for my absence. Mer. O, is that all? I warrant you. Amb. I would tell you Sir But how it happened. Mer. Briefe, good Master Ambler, Mere-craft seemes full of businesse. Put your selfe to your rack: for I haue tasque Of more importance. Amb. Sir you'll laugh at me! But (so is Truth) a very friend of mine, Finding by conference with me, that I liu'd Too chast for my complexion (and indeed Too honest for my place, Sir) did aduise me If I did loue my selfe (as that I do, I must confesse) Mer. Spare your Parenthesis. Amb. To gi' my body a little euacuation— Mer. Well, and you went to a whore? Amb. No, Sr. I durst not (For feare it might arriue at some body's eare, It should not) trust my selfe to a common house; Ambler tels this with extraordinary speed. But got the Gentlewoman to goe with me, And carry her bedding to a Conduit-head, Hard by the place toward Tyborne, which they call My L. Majors Banqueting-house. Now Sir, This morning Was Execution; and I ner'e dream't on't, Till I heard the noise o' the people, and the horses; And neither I, nor the poore Gentlewoman Durst stirre, till all was done and past: so that I'the Interim, we fell a sleepe againe.

But, when I wak'd, to put on my cloathes, a sute, I made new for the action, it was gone, And all my money, with my purse, my seales, My hard-wax, and my table-bookes, my studies, And a fine new deuise, I had to carry My pen, and inke, my ciuet, and my tooth-picks, All vnder one. But, that which greiu'd me, was The Gentlewomans shoes (with a paire of roses, And garters, I had giuen her for the businesse) So as that made vs stay, till it was darke. For I was faine to lend her mine, and walke In a rug, by her, barefoote, to Saint Giles'es. Mer. A kind of Irish penance! Is this all, Sir? Amb. To satisfie my Lady. Mer. I will promise you, Sr. Amb.

Well, I'll beginne to practice, And scape the imputation of being Cuckold, By mine owne act. Mer. yo'are right. Eve. Come, you ha' put Your selfe to a simple coyle here, and your freinds, By dealing with new Agents, in new plots. Mer. No more o' that, sweet cousin. Eve. What had you To doe with this fame Wittipol, for a Lady? Mer. Question not that: 'tis done. Eve. You had some straine 'Boue E-la? Mer. I had indeed. Eve. And, now, you crack for't. Mer. Do not vpbraid me. Eve. Come, you must be told on't; You are so couetous, still, to embrace More then you can, that you loose all. Mer. 'Tis right. What would you more, then Guilty? Now, your succours. Scene. VJ. Shakles. Pvg Iniqvity. Divel. [Sha.] Here you are lodg'd, Sir, you must send your garnish, Pug is brought to New-gate. If you'll be priuat. Pvg. There it is, Sir, leaue me. To New-gate, brought? How is the name of Deuill Discredited in me! What a lost fiend Shall I be, on returne? My Cheife will roare In triumph, now, that I haue beene on earth, A day, and done no noted thing, but brought That body back here, was hang'd out this morning. Enter Iniquity the Vice. Well! would it once were midnight, that I knew My vtmost. I thinke Time be drunke, and sleepes; He is so still, and moues not! I doe glory Now i'my torment. Neither can I expect it, I haue it with my fact. Ini. Child of hell, be thou merry: Put a looke on, as round, boy, and red as a cherry. Cast care at thy posternes; and firke i' thy fetters, They are ornaments, Baby, haue graced thy betters: Looke vpon me, and hearken. Our Cheife doth salute thee, And least the coldyron should chance to confute thee, H' hath sent thee, grant-paroll by me to stay longer A moneth here on earth, against cold Child, or honger Pvg. How? longer here a moneth? Ing. Yes, boy, till the Session, That so thou mayest haue a triumphall egression. Pvg. In a cart, to be hang'd. Ing. No, Child, in a Carre, The charriot of Triumph, which most of them are. And in the meane time, to be greazy, and bouzy, And nasty, and filthy, and ragged and louzy, With dam'n me, renounce me, and all the fine phrases; That bring, vnto Tiborne, the plentifull gazes. Pvg. He is a Diuell! and may be our Cheife! The great Superiour Diuell! for his malice: Arch-diuel! I acknowledge him. He knew What I would suffer, when he tie'd me vp thus In a rogues body: and he has (I thanke him) His tyrannous pleasure on me, to confine me To the vnlucky carkasse of a Cutpurse, Wherein I could do nothing. Div. Impudent fiend, The great Deuill enters, and vpbraids him with all his dayes worke. Stop thy lewd mouth. Doest thou not shame and tremble To lay thine owne dull damn'd defects vpon An innocent case, there? Why thou heauy slaue! The spirit, that did possesse that flesh before Put more true life, in a finger, and a thumbe, Then thou in the whole Masse. Yet thou rebell'st And murmur'st? What one profer hast thou made, Wicked inough, this day, that might be call'd Worthy thine owne, much lesse the name that sent thee? First, thou did'st helpe thy selfe into a beating Promptly, and with't endangered'st too thy tongue: A Diuell, and could not keepe a body intire One day! That, for our credit. And to vindicate it, Hinderd'st (for ought thou know'st) a deed of darknesse: Which was an act of that egregious folly, As no one, to'ard the Diuel, could ha' thought on. This for your acting! but for suffering! why Thou hast beene cheated on, with a false beard, And a turn'd cloake. Faith, would your predecessour The Cutpurse, thinke you, ha' been so? Out vpon thee, The hurt th'hast don, to let men know their strength, And that the'are able to out-doe a diuel Put in a body, will for euer be A scarre vpon our Name! whom hast thou dealt with, Woman or man, this day, but haue out-gone thee Some way, and most haue prou'd the better fiendes? Yet, you would be imploy'd? Yes, hell shall make you Prouinciall o' the Cheaters ! or Bawd-ledger, For this side o' the towne! No doubt you'll render A rare accompt of things. Bane o' your itch, And scratching for imployment. I'll ha' brimstone To allay it sure, and fire to sindge your nayles off, But, that I would not such a damn'd dishonor Sticke on our state, as that the diuell were hang'd; And could not saue a body, that he tooke Iniquity takes him on his back. From Tyborne, but it must come thither againe: You should e'en ride. But, vp away with him— Ini. Mount, dearling of darkenesse, my shoulders are broad: He that carries the fiend, is sure of his loade. The Diuell was wont to carry away the euill; But, now, the Euill out-carries the Diuell. Scene.

Sha. O! such an accident falne out at Newgate, Sir: A great piece of the prison is rent downe! The Diuell has beene there, Sir, in the body— Of the young Cut-purse, was hang'd out this morning, But, in new clothes, Sir, euery one of vs know him. These things were found in his pocket. Amb. Those are mine, Sr. Sha. I thinke he was committed on your charge, Sir. For a new felony Amb. Yes. Sha. Hee's gone, Sir, now, And left vs the dead body. But withall, Sir, Such an infernall stincke, and steame behinde, You cannot see St Pulchars Steeple, yet. They smell't as farre as Ware, as the wind lies, By this time, sure. Fit. Is this vpon your credit, friend? Fitz-dottrel leaues counterfaiting. Sha. Sir, you may see, and satisfie your selfe. Fit. Nay, then, 'tis time to leaue off counterfeiting. Sir I am not bewitch'd, not haue a Diuell: No more then you. I doe defie him, I, And did abuse you. These two Gentlemen Put me vpon it. (I haue faith against him) They taught me all my tricks. I will tell truth, And shame the Feind. See, here, Sir, are my bellowes, And my false belly, and my Mouse, and all That should ha' come forth? Man. Sir, are not you asham'd Now of your solemne, serious vanity? Pov. I will make honorable amends to truth. Fit. And so will I. But these are Coozeners, still; And ha' my land, as plotters, with my wife: Who, though she be not a witch, is worse, a whore. Man. Sir, you belie her. She is chaste, and vertuous, And we are honest. I doe know no glory A man should hope, by venting his owne follyes, But you'll still be an Asse, in spight of prouidence. Please you goe in, Sir, and heare truths, then iudge 'hem: And make amends for your late rashnesse; when, You shall but heare the paines and care was taken, To saue this foole from ruine (his Grace of Drown'd-land) Fit. My land is drown'd indeed— Pov. Peace. Man. And how much His modest and too worthy wife hath suffer'd By mis-construction, from him, you will blush, First, for your owne beliefe, more for his actions! His land is his: and neuer, by my friend, Or by my selfe, meant to another vse, But for her succours, who hath equall right. If any other had worse counsells in't, (I know I speake to those can apprehend mee) Let 'hem repent 'hem, and be not detected. It is not manly to take ioy, or pride In humane errours (wee doe all ill things, They doe 'hem worst that loue 'hem, and dwell there, Till the plague comes) The few that haue the seeds Of goodnesse left, will sooner make their way To a true life, by shame, then punishment. The End.</field>
