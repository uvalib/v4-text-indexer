      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âThe Hall of State of the Palace of WhitehallâA throne under a canopyâLarge folding doorsâThe room newly and sumptuously furnishedâGentlemen waiting in groupsâPerceval with ThurloeâSir Jacob Chubb with IngoldsbyâSmoothly with Robert Deagle, Citizens, &amp;c.âThe whole scene in loud confusionâTwo or three exclaim, âHush! hush!âHis Highness!ââAll turn in silence. Smo. No, no; a false alarm. Now, sir? Dea. As I said, I am but an humble household servant of his highnessâ Smo. Tut! tut! sir, you're too modest; you have access to his ear when others can't put in a word. Well, you see my account for the funeral of his highness, that's (points downwards) buried; he is up there of courseâbut my account is no trifleâthe costliest funeral that was ever seen in England, as it ought to be of course, for such a man as the great Protector, Oliverâand I've done my duty by his present highness, though I say it. Here's an address, with an offer of all our lives and fortunes. Now, if I could but see my way in that account in case anything should happenâthey say the armyâ Dea. Oh, we shall find means to keep the army quiet. Smo. I hope so. Still, if anything should happen? Dea. Do you come to speak treason in the Protector's own palace? Smo. Dear me!âtreason! I! with such an address as this in my handâbut I forget, nobody sees. (Offering purse.) Take it at once. [Groupe turn, and stop to speak with IngoldsbyâThey shortly separateâOne crossing over and joining Perceval as Thurloe leaves himâThe other two are joined by two from ante-room, and remain in corner. Dea. I must, for fear you should be observed; this way, if anything can be doneâ [They walk up, crossing stage to folding doors, and pass throughâThurloe coming forward with Perceval. The Ambassador from Denmark, too, has moved His highness in that business of Charles Stuart, Which you proposed to me; but wait till the Protector Can speak with you alone. [Crossing to Ingoldsby. Lord Ingoldsby, You have one with you to present an address; His Highness prays you to be brief with him, And so to pass on at onceâthe time is busy. [Exit Thurloe. Ing. I warrant we'll not waste a moment of it; I'll march my knight across at the step of charge. Chu. (Advancing as Thurloe leaves Ingoldsby.) May I ask your lordship who that is? Ing. The secretary Thurloeâ Chu. Aha! a great man. They'll be sure To ask at Quidlingboro' who I've seen. A great man that for one! Do you know, my lord, When I had the honor of receiving knighthood From the great Oliver, I never saw him; I heard his voice just ringing in my ears As sharp as a musket shotââArise, Sir Jacob.â I dared not raise My eyes to him; though when I went back, Sir Jacob, The folks of Quidlingboro' rather smiled To think I could hardly tell how I was made so. I'll take 'em a full account of this Protector. Use makes us bolder. Ing. Look, but pass at onceâ You will offend his highness to detain him. Chu. I'd not offend his highness for the worldâ I know, as an alderman, what men in office feel When those about them will be tedious. I speak as an independent manâbeing knighted, I've nothing to ask of the Protector. Ing. Nothing! Chu. Whyâsince your lordship hints it, he might make me A baronet. I Confess I should like to be called after my death âSir Jacob, the first baronet, the founder âOf all the Chubbs.â Would your lordship kindly mention it to his highness? Ing. If upon some good cause. Chu. The presentation Of this addressâ'tis worth a baronetcy. Ing. Pledging your lives and fortunes? Chu. Oh, that's nothing! All the addresses do that; but, the comparison Of his late highness with Moses, Job, and Noah, With the figures about the ark and the Red Sea! I put in them myself. Would your lordship read it? Ing. No, no; I'll think of the baronetcy. Chu. Aye! We could get up another address, and compare His present living highness to anybody He would prefer. All would have suited him as well as his father. Good lack! that we should be praising a dead man, When we might have got something from a living one. [During this Falconberg has entered folding doors. Fal. (To Ingoldsby.) I must speak with youânews from the army, Ingoldsby. This place won't serveâI must consult with youâ 'Tis of deep moment, as you love his highness! Ing. Nay, I am with youâno wordâlet us walk. [Exit Falconberg and Ingoldsby. Chu. (Knocking the address about in his hands.) Such a waste of precious words, when he can't read 'em!â But that is scan-mag to an alderman. I could call myself an ass!âno one would think it, But I could. (Trumpet sounds.) He's coming! [All move towards their places, beside and in front of the throneâOfficers, &amp;c., from ante-room crowd up the doors. Dear me! how I quiver! Where is my friendâLord Ingoldsby? What! gone? At such a moment! gone! They're coming! Gone! Why, that's his cloak! there! when he should be here. [Going to the door. I shall lose my senses! My lord! Lord Ingoldsby! Sure he don't know me, for he walks away; I must catch him, or lose the baronetcy. [Exit. [During this time several Lords and Gentlemen have entered the room as preceding Richard Cromwell, who now enters, accompanied by Thurloe, and the French and Danish Ambassadors. Cro. (To French Amb.) My lord, we thank our royal brother of France Heartily for the assurance that you bring us, And we do not fear It being the nation's might, not ours, we proffer. Our brother Louis shall find this friendly state Chang'd only in the name of him who rules it. (To Danish Ambassador, who advances from back.) The King of Denmark's proffer'd service to us, We accept as friendly; by a private messenger We'll answer him on whose behalf he has spoken. [Joins French Ambassador. Thu. (Presenting.) So, please your highness, Mr. Deputy Smoothly, With an address of Wardmote, which himself And his fellow citizens lay at your highness' feet, Condoling on the nation's loss and yoursâ Yet, trusting all they have, and all they are, To the guidance of your wisdom and your fortunes. Cro. We accept their proffer with acknowledgments As sincere as their own words. Speaking thus to you, We speak to all who bring the like kind greetings, If more be here in presenceâand desire them Thus to accept our answer and our thanks. [He extends his hand, which Smoothly kisses, and passes, as do the rest of the CitizensâRichard Cromwell talks with those around him. Smo. (Aside to Deagle.) You'll not forget to speak about the money? Dea. Trust meâyou will not be the worse for me. [Smoothly passes. Nor much the better. [The Citizens, &amp;c., begin to go out. Re-enter Sir Jacob Chubb, breathless, followed by Ingoldsby. Chu. Pray, you now, my lord, We shall be too lateâthey'll goâgood lack, this fluster To be presented in. Ing. Come on at once! [He drags on Sir Jacob and presents himâSir Jacob kneels hurriedly. So, please your highness, Sir Jacob Chubbâaddress From Quidlingboro'âCondolenceâyour highness' fatherâ Congratulation on accessionâoffer Of lives and fortunes. [Richard Cromwell gives his hand, which Sir Jacob kissesâCromwell then continues his conversation with the others, turning quite from Sir Jacob. Ing. Come! Chu. I hav'n't seen him! And he wont turn this way. Dea. (Who has crossed to near the throne.) Please to move on. Chu. âMove on!ââthe corporation of Quidlingboro' Treated with âMove on!â Ing. Farewell! I have business. [Exit. Chu. Gone! gone again! not even a sight of his highness, Beyond his hat and cloak, stockings and shoes! Tho' Quidlingboro's not so large as London, It is a place of importance, politically, As they may find. Dea. (Going up to him.) The doors will soon be closed, sir. Chu. Humph! thank you, sirâthey'll slap 'em in one's teeth nextâ Right in one's teeth. Our borough, next election, Sends Opposition members. Not even one lookâ Not even so much as hear him speak one word! Nothing to tell! I'll rouse the borough for this, If ever a patriotic speech could do it. (To Deagle.) I'm going, sirâI thank youâa fine Protector! [Exit. [During these speeches the Ambassadors have taken leave of Richard Cromwell, and Thurloe has brought Perceval to him, and given directions to the Officers to close the folding doors, which they doâAll are gone except the Protector, Perceval, and Robert Deagle. Cro. Put these addresses with the others, Robert, In the small cabinet; be careful of them, For surely, never prince had so great wealth On paperâI'd be privateâto the door. If any of the council seek to see me, You may admit them. [Exit Attendant. Enter Lady Dorothy Cromwell. Lady C. First, a word with meâ For now I scarcely see you all the day, Save in the company of those whom state, Not kindness, brings around us. Cro. (Kissing her.) You are right; We need the rest and strength of love at home To give us heart for toil, and strife and smiles, More wearisome than anger. And yetâ But you regret your country life? Lady C. Oh, no! I only sometimes wish we could have both, But never to yield this. Cro. Yet we were happy. Lady C. Aye, happy! Cro. Is that nothing?âvery happy. I, with my hawk, or hound, on my good horse, Drinking the fresh health of the morning air, Till I could laugh of the mere merriment That stirs in vigorous motionâyouâ Lady C. Ah, I! Left to my humble tasks about the house, While you were following the hawk and hound, And laughing with your merry hunting train. Cro. Not always. Lady C. Noânot always. Cro. When you chose You had your horse, and your pet falcon too, And every man in all the hamlets round, Gentle or simple, for your servitorâ What could you have more? Lady C. It was very wellâ Very well, then. Cro. And we had friends around usâhonest neighboursâ Such as did all the duties of that nameâ Wept and rejoic'd as we wept and rejoic'd. Besides our own, your father and our children, There were such fire-side faces of a night As made old Winter jocundâthere were voices Out-chirped the merry cricket on the hearthâ Lady C. And our calm Sundays, moving tow'rd the church, Through humble ranks that waited our approach. It was pleasant To kneel in such pure charity. I love That little church! Cro. She sleeps within it. Sheâ Sweetest, bestâI'd rest beside her there When the hour comes. Lady C. Keep even the thought far hence; You have many left to live forâmuch to do In life yourself. Cro. Aye! Lady C. And that cheerfully, Cheerfully! nobly! bravely! proudly! I Trust not alone to be your consort here; Honor'd in your true greatness, but to be The consort of your name, in many a page That history shall write of weal to England And glory to yourself. Cro. If such may be my lot, and honor with it! My course is clearâI'd strive to know the right, And do it. Lady C. And so leave a heritage Unto your son, the fairest earth can offer. Cro. A good name from his father, and a mind Fram'd by his father's deeds. Lady C. And England with them! Cro. Aye, if it may be, England for my son, And he for England, if his country's will Be so, and he can serve it. Enter Ingoldsby. Cro. Ah! well returned, good namesake. Ing. Good, my lord! The news I bring is scarcely worth your welcome. Cro. What news? Lady C. What news, if I may hear it? Cro. Speak! Since you will bear part of my cares. Lady C. I'd know themâ Should I not?âif I mayâthey touch me too. Cro. Perhaps, too nearlyâspeak! Ing. The army murmur, The chiefs cabal. Lady C. Richard! Cro. If you will hear, It must be patiently and fearlessly. I expected this. To you, dear wife, the rumour Comes best in this plain shape. (Crosses.) Say all you know. Ing. Your late refusal of their suits has stirr'd them To mutinous words. Cro. The suits themselves were treasonous, Not against me alone, but all I govern, Striving to put their will for rightful law. Enter Thurloe. Thurloe, you come in season; Hear you of the army? Thu. I am glad your highness Has heard of them from others. Fleetwood's plans Are ripening now. Lady C. Fleetwood's? Our brother Fleetwood! Cro. Patience! your promise, or you mar our work. Aye! he's so near the throne, that but a step, He thinks, will seat him there. What would they now? Thu. Finding your acts supported by the Commons, They threaten them. Cro. Let England judge between them And its elected servants. If all are true to meâwho should be true For their own sakes, not mineâthis faction's quelled As it comes forth to light. Lady C. Should be so quell'd, That of its Hydra heads, not one remain To guide their master to another treason. Cro. You speak, wife, in the cruelty of fear; He, who has right and power is above wrathâ I am their master, and the people's minister, And not a brawler for the prize of reigning. Justice itself, done in the thirst of blood, Is but a murder. Lady C. I was wrong. Cro. A momentâ A moment wrong. It is your privilege To speak great wordsâwhich, if they come to acts, Yourselves would first exclaim at what you had urg'd. Enter Deagle. Dea. May it please your highness, Lord Disbrowe, with some officers, requests A conference with your highness. Cro. I'll receive them. [Exit Deagle. So! they are come! Lady C. Disbrowe! our uncle Disbrowe! They cannot mean us ill, as you suppose. Or he is here to proffer service? Cro. He! You surely know him better. Lady C. We're environ'd By traitors, then, and know not whom to trust; But you are calmâyou smile still. Cro. If we be, I can't afford to fear. Lady C. I'll leave youâsmiles, As you have said, and now I see, may be More wearisome to wear than frowns. [Exit. Cro. My uncle! The veriest clown that ever was styled a lord, Lambert, and Fleetwood drive the battering ram Against my power; Disbrowe's its wooden head, That swings on senselessly, strike what it may, Is of no nature to feel hurt itself. Enter Disbrowe, attended by Berry, Darnel, and other Officers. Good morrow. Since you come with such a train, I speak, as I suppose, to my Lord Disbrowe, Rather than my good uncle. Welcome, gentlemen. [Seats himself, and puts on his hat. I wait you. Dis. You shall hear, my lord. Your highness Knows that I neither make nor love long speeches. It is the army's wish that you dissolve The Parliament. Cro. Indeed! Dis. (After a pause.) No other answer? Cro. As you, I neither make nor love long speeches. Dis. We come here for the soldiers' libertiesâ We've fought and bled to raise the Commonwealth, And will not suffer coward lawyers rein us With our own power. Cro. You'd rule the Commonwealth? Dis. We'd rule ourselves. Cro. Can you? Dis. Aye, though you sneer, We will. We look to elect our General, And you refuse it; we demand a trial Of every soldier by court-martial only, And you refuse thatâthat the war council Alone shall cashier officers, denied By you, and that with reprimand. The Commons Abet you in your plans against the army; Try to dissolve our councils, voting them Illegal, and demand an oath that we Shall leave them undisturbed, in their own functionsâ 'Tis either they or weâand we've the sword That won them leave to sit, and claim such power, We'll use it for our own. Cro. Against your country You speak out plainlyâso I answer. I Am by the law your Generalâwill hold The office to prevent the wrongs you aim at, Striving to elect another; every officer Shall, as he ought, obey the nation's chiefâ Or, at his will, shall be cashier'd. The soldier Shall answer to the laws as other men, As by the laws he is protected like them; This have I said, and this not to maintain Were to cast down the power which the three realms Have with a free assent plac'd in my hands. Dis. I sayâ Cro. Pray speak, sir, when I ask it of you. I am yet what they've confirmed me. What's the soldier But as I am, the servant of his country, Most honor'd when he executes its laws? A soldier's noblest name is a true citizen. Robbers, indeed, fight for the spoil they snatch, And quarrel for it after. Choose you which You please to call yourselves? Dis. We have the power, And I would drag you from the chair you sit in, And end your reign thus, if you should refuse Still to grant what we claim. Cro. (Starting up.) Thou drag me hence! Traitor! But stir!âI have my own good arm To avenge that insult. And there may be here In your own company some who have not Forgotten every oath, and the respect Men owe themselves; Or, if I stand alone, let me but see thee Advance one foot, thou traitor, if thou dar'st. [Ingoldsby and Thurloe have advanced to support Richard CromwellâBerry and the other Officers interpose. Ber. My lord! Officer. Lord Disbrowe! Dar. Pray, your highnessâ Cro. (Seeing Ingoldsby and Thurloe.) Ah! Here are twoâI had forgottenâhere's Dick Ingoldsby, Who, tho' he cannot cant and fawn, pray heaven To win respect from men, I dare call honest, And trust him with my life, though 'twere assail'd By more and braver than I see around me. Thu. Your highnessâ Cro. Thank you, Thurloe; you remind me Of what I am. Aught else? Dis. You have heard allâ I do not seek to anger you. We claim What at the first, or last, we shall enforce. Cro. âWe!â Dost thou know what part of that great âWe!â Thou art, man?âjust the hound that's leash'd, or loos'dâ Halloo'd on, or re-call'dâcaress'd or lash'd To do their work, or sport, who set him on, And when the game's run down, driven back to kennel To his dog's-mess. Dis. I am no toothless hound. Cro. No; when thou art they'll hang thee. Do'st thou think Fleetwood or Lambert, when they speak of thee, Say âWe!â? I'll teach theeâeach says âIâ alone; Fleetwood says, âI would be Lord General, âThat I may after be the Lord Protector.â Lambert says, âFleetwood shall be General; âThat in his name the foul work may be done, âIs needful to make me the Lord Protector.â In serving Fleetwood, thou art but a tool's toolâ Fleetwood's but Lambert's huntsman, Uncle Disbrowe, And thou art still the hound. Dis. Had your own fatherâ Cro. I speak thee kindly man. I do not chide thee As, being thy Lord and Leader, I should chide. If to my father, brother of thy wife, Thou had'st spoken what thou hast said to me, thou knowest Ere this thy tongue had ceased to wag at all. I'd stay thee as a wayward, foolish hind, That digs a trench beneath a toppling wall, Or as a child that plays with fire and powder. The evil that thou do'st be sure thou'lt share; Although thou shut'st thine eyes, and think'st thou'rt safe, Mark meâthou'lt rue this day! I tell it thee In very pity. Dis. And I thank your highness As your counsel merits; meanwhile let it serve Yourself rather than me. Dissolve this Parliament! Let that return your father's power displac'd, Against all right. The army will make terms For you and your authority. Refuse us, I tell you once againâ Thu. His highness needs not To hear irreverence twice. Cro. Let him speak on! Thu. 'Twere fitter in an honest loyal man Not to say kinsman. Cro. Thurloe! by your life, Your dutyâlove to meâno pleading to him. Let him bear my answer back. Thu. So let it be; Yet, such an answer as may well befit Your highness to return to men who cannot All speak by such a tongue, as we have heard. This man's intemperance should not move your wrath Against true subjects. Cro. Ah, you're right again. Dis. If you believe I speak not in the voice Of the whole army, when I may return To have this formal answer, I will bring Proof of my missionâyou shall hear and see, And feel I speak their will. Cro. Bring me that proof Themselves, and let them, if their will be soâ But, no! I'll not disgrace them with the thoughtâ I'll wait you here to-morrow; here we stay All leave-taking. [Exeunt Disbrowe, Officers, &amp;c. (To Thurloe.) Do you think that I'll forgive you Checking me twice to make me feel my folly? My good friendâand you, Ingoldsby, go forth. You to the army!âfind what strength is there On which we may rely. You to the Commons! (To Thurloe) If they be true to me as I am firm For them, and for the rights they've trusted to me, I'll plant my peaceful standard in their House, And let the army seek and slay us there, Ere I will yield. Away, we'll not disgrace The right by sloth or doubt. Speed, my good friends! [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âLady Dorothy Cromwell's Apartment in Whitehall. Lady C. discovered, pacing the room with disordered stepsâ Patience attending. Lady C. (Stopping.) Your fellow servants, then, say nothing? Pat. No, madam, But they look sorrowful. Lady C. You questioned them? Pat. I did not think that right, madam. Lady C. You should: Some one should speak right outâright out at once, And tell me what to fear. (Paces on, then stops again.) The Lord Protector, Before he wentâ(Goes on, and stops again.) The Secretary Thurloe Came to himâdid you say so?âand went forth Again. And Colonel Ingoldsby? Pat. They did, madam, As Robert told me. Lady C. (Going on, and to herself.) And he would not speak To me;âhe meant to spare me; and to know that, Is to feel all that he would spare meâmore, Let me hope more. I could notâI'd not wish To live, ifâ Pat. Would you see your children, madam? Lady C. No! (Paces on.) They would look up in my face, and wonder, And question me. Why should you think I'd see them? Pat. Only because it is your custom. Lady C. Aye, It was my custom, too, to give them lessons Such as befitted princes. I could see Their future acts in every word I spoke, As though my teaching made the destiny Of unborn myriads; I beheld them honor'd, Rever'dâador'd, for what they learn'd from me. [Paces on hurriedlyâstops. Black night! dead silence! come upon the world For ever!â'twould be like the vanishing Of such a hope. It is not strange that men Commit great crimes, or deeds that are call'd crimes, Rather than have the heart torn from their bosoms, By which alone they live. Enter Deagle. How now?âforget you Your reverence, to approach me thus abruptly? Is this a sign of what is coming on us? Dea. I pray your highness to forgive my faultâ I bring a letter from Lord Falconberg Of instant moment to the Lord Protector. Lady C. (Hastily.) Give it me. Noâyou see he is not here. Yet there's a footstepâit is hisâwait for himâ Away wench!âleave us! [Exit Patience. Enter Richard Cromwell. Ah! you see my faceâ Why cannot I read your's? Cro. Peace for a moment. (Taking letter from Deagle.) What's this?âfrom Falconberg? All well with him! Lady C. Thank heaven! Cro. Right honest, faithful.âIs Lord Ingoldsby Return'd? Dea. Not yet, my lord. Cro. Nor master Secretary? Dea. No, my lord. Cro. Time! Time!âleave me. Bring either to me, The moment he arrives. [Exit Deagle. Would both were here! Lady C. You have heard no evil tidings? Cro. None. Lady C. Our kinsmen? Cro. You see our brother Falconberg is true. Lady C. I knew it. You have been with other friends? Cro. They should come to me. Lady C. But nowâ Cro. Who would cast off The shew of duty now casts off the intent: The cause is theirs I strive for; if they prize it, Let their deeds speak with mine. Lady C. Aye, deeds! All's sure If you speak so. You'll do whate'er you speak; You said so, andâI know it. You'll not suffer Disbrowe to drag you from your chair. Cro. I pray you Be silentâ There are words that stick and fester in the heartâ No wonder if they madden! I'd be sure And strong enough to pardon, for I hate him. Lady C. Your hate's his due! They trust to your forbearance, Not their own strength. But there are others, Richard, Look to you to be generous and brave For themâfor such as love youâas you love. Richard, I could not look upon my children Just now! but now, reading your looks aright, I'd hold their hands, and watch the strife may come, Nor should they see me quail, nor feel me thrill. Tell meâ Cro. As you love me, wife, forbear! You assist My enemies to urge me. But be patient, For to speak to you, as to my own soul, I lack no part of courage, but its calmness. Enter Ingoldsby. Ha! Ingoldsbyâthe army? Ing. Of the leaders Your highness knows alreadyâthe most part Are leagued for their own plans; the officers Below them are divided: some would serve them, And some uphold your power. The soldiery, Neither the time nor safety to your cause, Would let me sound too far; but as I think The name of Cromwell, and their love for you, Will stead you well against your enemies. Lady C. Now blessings on their faith and honesty! Cro. Who's there? Enter Deagle. The Secretary is not come? Dea. Not yet, my lord. Cro. My signet to Lord Falconberg, And bid him haste to me in arms!âbe swift and silent! [Exit Deagle. Your own regiment?â Ing. Waits the orders Which I shall gladly bear it from your highness. Cro. What starts you, wife? Lady C. The rolling of the drumsâ Do you not hear it? Cro. The first note of war! But sounds or sights must not affright us now. Lady C. Hark! heard you not? Again! Cro. The trumpet callâ Lady C. Aye, and the tramp of horseânearer and nearerâ They will seize upon us here! Cro. They are marching hither. Come they as friends, or foes, they are no more Than we're prepar'd to front. Ing. Shall we not meet them? Cro. I would hear what the Commons have resolv'd; Then march the faithful regiments to their guard, And send the order thence to cashier all That disobey the law, or dare to threaten The rightful powers that make it, and should wield it. Enter Deagle. Dea. Lord Disbrowe, and the officers, await Your highness' pleasure. Many Throng round the doors, their regiments line the streets. Cro. The better. We shall have the soldiery At hand. Now bless thee wife. I will through them all Myself to the Commons. Dea. Might I beg your highness One moment. There's a man, a Captain Darnel, Who bade me crave your highness' ear for him Before you meet the officers; as he said, For your own sake. Ing. I would reject no service. Cro. Quick then, one word with him, no more. [Exit Deagle. And then We'll face these traitors. The chosen of a realm May fall a martyr, as he'd live a victor, And with as proud a joy. Enter Darnel. Oh you would speak with me! Be brief. Dar. Alone to your highness. Cro. Give us leave. [All retire. Dar. First pardon, and your promise that my words Shall never harm me with your enemies. Cro. You have both. Dar. You would be free'd from those who oppose you? Cro. Freed! Dar. Freed. Cro. Speak on! Dar. Give but your word that those Who do you this good office shall succeed To those whom they remove, ere night you have not One enemy of power throughout the camp. Cro. And how? Dar. Our means are taken surely, silently. We know your active foes; one of ourselves Stands at the side of each. Speak, and 'tis done. Cro. Leave me! Dar. My lordâ Cro. Leave meâyou have my pardon; It may be you have serv'd me. I am calm! I'll keep the silence I have promised youâ You have my pardon, go. Dar. Henceforth my sword Is theirs who do not fear to use it. [Exit Darnel. Cro. Friends, Shall we on? I am prouder than I was, Perhaps with no ignoble reason. Come! Enter Deagle. Dea. My lord, I dare your highness' great displeasure, Lest I should scant my duty. The lord Disbrowe Demands to see your highness instantly. Cro. Demands! Dea. I had not ventur'd to speak thus, But that his soldiers wait upon his will. Cro. I am not wrath with thee, thou dost good service. Demands!â'Death! will he not let me overlook him As I was fain to do? But now I scorn him, And can say to him, bear my message rightly And swiftly too, or I may supersede it. I'll answer his demand. [Exit Deagle. Disbrowe! whom I, Had I but said one word, but look'd âa yes,â Could have doom'd as certainly.âWe will not wait, As if to assume contempt; I can despise him Enough without that. Farewell, wife!âno words! What you shall hear or see of me I know not! But this, I'll meet you with as clear a brow As that with which I leave you. On, my friends. Exeunt all but Lady C. Lady C. Is he too deeply stung? I know he feels More than he speaks. Richard! yet he will do Bravest when most he feels. And for a kingdom! Hold there my heart, for thinking of our state There is no danger but what perils that There cannot be a coward on a throne Such as are meaner men. His destiny Is not the tombstone tale of life and death! Power and glory are his years. Live, Richard, The only life thou should'st, a sovereign still! [Exit. SCENE II. âThe Banquetting Room at WhitehallâDisbrowe, Berry, Darnel, and many Officers on one sideâ Falconberg and Deagle, apart. Dis. Lambert and Fleetwood were with Lenthal? Ber. Aye, He had consented to resume the Speakershipâ Had summon'd all the members of that Parliament Which Oliver dissolv'd at the sword's point. Dis. We have no more to do there than make way for them; If Oliver by force might drive them out, We, the force being ours, may re-instate them. [Turning to the Protector's party. Does his highness think his army holiday courtiers, Or lacqueys waiting for a piece of coin, That he slights us thus with his delay? Fal. His highnessâ Dea. Answer him not, my lord. Pray you a moment. [They talk apart. Dis. (To Berry.) Lay the commission to dissolve the Parliament There, ready for his signature. Dea. (Aside to Falconberg.) Good speed! [Exit Falconberg. Dis. Ha! put yourself at the head of your own regiment, For Falconberg has left the room in haste. He'll lead his men, if it should come to blows. [Exit Berry. Second Attendant enters, and announces the Lord Protector âRichard Cromwell and Ingoldsby enter with attendantsâRichard Cromwell bows slightlyâDisbrowe comes before him. Dis. We have waited, sir, For our dispatch, rather to serve your highness Than for our own need. [Richard Cromwell passes himâsurveys the Officers attentively, then goes to a windowâa cheer is heard from without. Dar. (To Disbrowe from another window.) 'Tis from Falconberg's regiment! Berry is thereâthe other men are silent. [Richard Cromwell seats himself, and takes up the paper which had been placed on the table. Dis. He hardly changes colour, yet I think It angers him. Dar. I thought he would have torn it. Cro. (To his own Attendants and Party.) Who plac'd this paper here? Dis. (After a pause.) 'Twas by my order. Cro. (Not regarding him) Which of my council has provided this? Dis. It is the army's claim. Cro. (As before.) Has any one Made himself Chancellor as well as General, Each by his own appointment? Dis. Sign that paper! You'd not believe I spoke the army's will? I have brought proofâthe leaders are around you, The soldiery you have beheld in the street. In their name I require you now to sign it, And say for them, who are here to make it good, If you refuse us we disclaim your power, And cast off all allegiance to your person. Cro. I arrest thee of high treason. He who would shew He does not share the crime, and would not share The penalty, stand from him. In your body, I know it, I have friendsâlet no one strike, But each one who is brave enough to own, Among dishonour'd men, he values honor, Come hither to my side, and share a victory Bloodless, as brave and honest. Dar. They're appall'd. Ing. Each fears his fellow. Dar. To the soldiery. [Exit. Dis. What! are ye ten to one, and can a word, The name of treason start you? did you bid me Declare your will, and yet you dare not now Second me with a deed that is as easy As but to will it. [Shouts withoutâ âLord Disbrowe! Give us our leader Disbrowe!â Ber. (Without.) The Protector Shall answer with his life for Disbrowe's safety. [Another cheerâIngoldsby advances on Disbrowe. Ing. We have friends!âyour sword! Deliver up your sword! Dis. Come on, and take it! Cro. Hold! I command you, friends and foes! To the Commons! There will I plant the standard of the people! Front me there, sirsâlay parricidal hands There if you can upon your country's freedom. Let England witness one indignity Done to its peaceful servants in their House, If the old heart beat yet within its body 'Twill rise, and with one blow assert and end. On! Dis. Stay! Cro. For thee!âback slave! self-selling slave! Folly and shame of treason! On! Enter Thurloe and Falconberg. Thu. My lord! I would crave your ear a moment. Cro. From the Commons? Thu. Aye, my good lord! Cro. Speak on, and speak aloudâ Their words are now my deeds, and let all know them. What say they? Thu. My good lordâ Cro. Speak all at once. Thu. Hearing the army's threats, they adjourn'd to wait Apart the dissolution they might fear, Without the insult that might come with it. Cro. They might fear? and at my hands!âdid you not tell themâ Are we not here in arms for them alone? Cowards! they have betrayed the noblest causeâ One of the few that do not shame the sword! Left me! that's nothing! as all men are left Who stand in the gap of peril for a herd To be struck down, and trampled on, and mock'd, Mock'd byâAh! dastards! Ing. For yourself Yield not. Fal. We're ready yet! Thu. Even I. Cro. 'Tis done! Do I not see my title is a scoff! Do I not feel your faith all I should prize? 'Tis nought for me to yield my despised life! But were my state rich, as 'tis base and worthless, I would not buy it with one true man's blood. Dis. Your highness now perhaps may need that paper. Cro. I doâand more, I thank you for the taunt That shews me able to preserve my friends, By yielding all, even to the spleen I feel Bending to one I most of all despise. Give me the pen. (Thurloe does so.) Cro. (Signs.) 'Tis done. (Giving the commission to Disbrowe.) Take, sir, your act. Aye, look!â'tis fairly sign'd; for my share in it Is a reprieve to all the innocent lives Your bandit swords had doom'd to butchery. The childâ The trembling woman, and the aged man, Whose bloody spectres shall not gast me here, Or bar me in the hereafter. From your murders I save them. Take this, for no other hand Is fit to finish what you have begun. Enter Darnel. Dar. Fleetwood and Lambert are escorting Lenthal, With such of the old Parliament, displaced By Oliver, as they can bring together To the Commons' house. Cro. Falconberg! meet them there. Since England's sword of justice is a weapon Each ruffian may snatch up for ruffian acts, I will not bear it more. Say this to themâ By whatever deed they choose, I will confirm it. I resign my state, cast down my insulted rule, Despised by me more than by its betrayers. Thu. My lord, this anarchyâ Cro. Will quickly end, For these blind seekers of the army's rights. That man, who envies every power above him, And would pull down all because he cannot rise, Have by their deed this day cashier'd themselves, And made a kingâaye, made Charles Stuart King. Dis. Treason to England! Cro. Are not thy lips pale To repeat that word? I tell thee what thou hast done, And thou thyself cry'st âTreason!â The event Shall be your foeâI am content to wait it; 'Twill save the land from you. I have doneâno more. Dis. Farewell to your highness. [Exit Disbrowe and Officers. Cro. Farewell to that name, indeed. I am now no more Than Richard Cromwell, and as poor a man As my enemies can wish me. Ing. Do not shame your friendsâ Our faith is firm. Shareânay, take all is ours. Fal. and Thu. All! all! Cro. 'Tis I who am sham'd that you should think I meant to complain or beg. I'll find content Yet. Pray you speed on that my last employ Of stateâFarewell. (They kneel.) No homage now; your hands. Let it be somewhat that a prince dethron'd, Can claim the friendly grasp of three just men Who have been so near to him. To that last office! And then, if you return, as equals should, Why, I will greet and thank you as a man Should thank the fast friends of his changed estate. Pray you no more words nowâfarewell! [Exeunt all but Cromwell. Alone! Thank heaven! alone!âI am a stranger now Where I have reign'd.âMute walls be silent still, Nor echo back my stealthy tread to start me Where I have pac'd a monarch! Am I yet The same thing that I was?âThe blow is struckâ The pain will come anonâPatience to bear it! Ah! I shall need it now. Enter Lady Cromwell. Lady C. They're gone. You've conquer'd, Richard! you've conquer'd themâyou could'nt look So placid if you had not. Cro. There's a conquest Makes us more placid than the one we win Over our enemies. Lady C. No, beseech you Richard, Don't make me think you're vanquish'd?âif you are, You could not be so cruel, but you'd feel As I must feel. Cro. Wife, wife, a throne has sunk Beneath my feet!âthink then what I must feel! But there's a raft to make out of the wreck, And our security must be enduranceâ Aye, our enduranceâyours with mine. I ask it Now in my needâask it of you, my wife. Lady C. Even of poor content, weâwe who have reign'd, Have not the humblest meansâwe are beset. I have seen it even now, with creditors That only wait your fall to put on you The base indignities that helpless poverty Must bearâand our poor children, whom I hop'd!â Let me not think of hopes that I have cherishedâ Let me not think of anything that bless'd meâ All that I treasur'd is engulph'd, and life Must follow next. Cro. Yes, look upon the past, Not upon this wild dream of royalty! But the better, happier past, that once we had, Whose joys shall come back to us. Lady C. Better! happier! Look there! the last who was depos'd pass'd there To deathâthe place has terrors written on it, To calm which, words are vain. His spirit haunts it To mark our fate to us. Cro. He could but witness The purity of conscience which is ready To meet that threatened fate. This place of terrors Is ours no moreâits memories pass with it! Oh! if I may for you, and for our children, Enjoy a life secure! But I must have at home The cheer to bear me onward, and from youâ Refuse it if you can, and be a foe More deadly than my worst. We have nothing left But love and fortitude, and mutual helpâ We will cling fast to them. Ay, lay your head Upon my heart, so both shall find their rest. Lady C. I have not the hope To say âheaven help us!â I will striveâI'll strive! [Exeunt. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA Chamber in an obscure lodging. Lady Dorothy Cromwell discovered looking from a window âPatience on the left. Lady C. He turns the corner now! At last, he runs! To the door! quick! [Exit Patience. He must not knock, or wait. Pass but to-dayâonly to-day! Yet, why? Each morrow brings new crueltiesânew terrors! But let me spare him this, the only blow The sternest manhood would not shame to feel. Re-enter Patience with Robert Deagle. Speak quickly, RobertâI must stay by your lord, Lest he should leave the house. Dea. Not for Heaven's sake now, madam, Nor for half an hour to come; almost by this time They must be setting forthâat the street's end He'd meet them. Lady C. Keep watch here stillâ I have little now to give you but my thanks; But you have chosen that payment for your service, And kindly do you earn itâwatch for me still. [Exit into chamber. Pat. What is it that so frights you? Dea. They have, good faithâit makes me choke to tell itâ Dug up the poor bones of his father, Oliver, That rested yonder in the abbeyânow They're forming a procession, that they may draw them To Tyburn, where upon the common gallows They mean to hang them. Pat. So, many of his old friends have been taken And executed; when I think of them, It makes me weep for him. Dea. Let us hope better. Pat. Since, now the King's return'd, and all seems settled, Why don't he leave the kingdom? Dea. Money, wench! His wife and children too; and they examine The vessels. Should they detain him but a day, And his creditors learn it, he might be their prisoner For life, as well as the King's. [Knocking at the door. (Looking down from the window.) There are Disbrowe, Berry, And another, at the door. The knaves and fools! Since the Restoration All has happened to them as he said 'twould happen; They made a rod for their own backs, and want him To ease the smart. [Knock at the door. Aye, aye! my masters, waitâ You wouldn't wait when he was Lord Protector, And so you must wait now. He will not see them, And if his creditors should dog them hither, And know who lives here, we shall have a siege Of every rogue that ever serv'd a writ, Commanded by the Sheriffs of London in person. Pat. I thought the Parliament had satisfied His creditors. Dea. Lord help your innocent soul! Creditors are such cormorantsâthere's no way To satisfy 'em, except by paying them. Pat. And didn't they? Dea. Oh, no; they thought it cheaper to make a law, No one should trouble him about his debts, Which law held well as long as they held wellâ But when they were kick'd out, their law went with 'em. [Another knock. Pat. They're knocking still. Dea. Let 'em; it is a luxury To an official person like myselfâ Pleasant remembrance of old times gone by. [Knock. Humph! they persevere! Enter Lady Dorothy Cromwell. Lady C. Admit those brawlers, Robertâno reproof Or slight will drive them from the door. 'Tis dangerous For us to be noted, and these men well known For what they have beenâGo! [Exit Deagle. You may leave me, girl. [Exit Patience. We hoped but for the safety of neglect, An humble prayerâbut vain! Enter Richard Cromwell. Let me speak with them But for to-day; I'll not dismiss them harshly, If they come in friendshipâfor the dangers round us Can scorn no help now. Cro. Dangers! Lady C. Aye, such dangers As we have spoken of, as you know. Oh, Richard! Richard! Said I not, from the height on which we stood, No one could fall and live. Enter Disbrowe, Berry, and Darnel. Cro. You seek me, gentlemen, Who am most unwilling to be found of you; I have no more to give, that you've preventedâ You have no more to takeâyou've taken all. Let it be a solace to my poverty That it divides us ever. Dis. We have need Still of each other. Ber. There's a common danger That can be only met by well-knit strength. Cro. There is no bond of union that can join us; You have my answer. Lady C. Yet you forgive them, Though 'tis to pardon more than I dare think, When they come back in kindness and in duty, Repenting what they've done against your rights, And offering servicesâ Cro. Which are a snare Worse than their former treasons. I speak plainly, Not angrily. My heart is subdued enough To grant forgiveness to whoe'er may ask it Simply and trulyâsuch as have no heart To seek and accept it so let me forget, For then my own is free. (To Disbrowe.) It is the hour I take the exercise my spirits need; Since we have spoken all that we may speak, 'Tis needless that your presence should detain me. Lady. C. Richard!âone moment! May I speak with you? Cro. When they will give us leave to speak alone. Lady C. Pray you, remain. Cro. To listen to professions That make my flesh creep with their loathsome falsehood. To your chamber; I'll return when they are gone. [Exit. Lady C. Merciful heaven! the very hour. Dis. He has left us. Dar. Speak then with her. Dis. With her? Dar. She had never spoken Of forgiving us, had she not hoped a service That should repay the past. Dis. Ah! I conceive you; It grieves me, cousin, that your husband should Bear malice for old feudsâI was to blame, That I confess, and frankly I admit my faults, and would repair them. Lady C. Sir, Have you been abroad to-day? Know you the sight That he may meet, of which you are the authors? You betray'd the son!âto you he owes the shame Fallen on his father's reliques; have you power To repair that? Dar. Not repairâavenge, perhapsâ Prevent more shame and wrong. It was that sight That brought us hither, madam. Dis. Yet, if it were but with the dead they had dealt! Many of those we used to call our friends, That used to sit at the same board with usâ Faces that look'd like brothers in our houses, Have died in torturesâno part of the butchery The law decrees being spared them. Lady C. Man! I know it; Why force upon my ears what I had plung'd In the sea's depth to stop them to? Dis. Because What they have done, shows plainly what they will do. Dar. And will they spare the highest they may reach at? What sacrifice so welcome as a Cromwell? Lady C. It has been my hourly thought. Richard! my children! [A distant shout heard. That peal! it must reach him! the howl of fiends Screaming around their prey! Dis. Nay, do not listen! Lady C. I know that it is thereâthat he must hear it. You, and his ancient friends, have done this. Dis. All is not lost yet! They have banished Every disbanded soldier twenty miles From Londonâevery disaffected personâ A name that's easily given to any one, When those who call names choose to think him soâ Under like penalties must not abide So near the capital. Dar. There is our hopeâ If all will see their danger, there's the means To avert it. Lady C. Ha! they have cast aside the weapon Another might take up. Dar. If but his highnessâ My tongue's accustom'd to the wordâ Lady C. My husband? Dis. If he would lead, and save us with himselfâ [A knock. Lady C. (She goes to the window.) Ah! he's return'd!âI pray you, gentlemenâ He leans against the door-postâgasps for breathâ I pray you, in yon chamberâdo not meet him Yet; I will speak with you; will call you forth If he can bear. (They go.) I thank you heartily. [Exeunt Disbrowe, Darnel, and Berry. Mercy of heaven! this hath stricken him, That he staggers at the blow; they have spoken truly, The terrible omen reaches him. Dear husband! [Meeting Richard Cromwell as he enters. Cro. Ah, they are gone!âthank heaven! Lady C. (Placing chair.) Here! rest here! It does not need to tellâI would have spar'd you, But this is not the worstâI knew 'twould comeâ Danger and death! You have heard all. Cro. I have, wife! Which of these men, that now sit in the Commons, Which of these felon judges, would have dar'd To stand before my father with a look Other than humble and obsequious? He's dead! and now the caitiffs seek their prey With the hyena's and the vulture's gust; Like them, they tear the body from the grave, But in a wretcheder instinct than the brutes! Hypocrisy and flattery are baseness Man, man, alone can reach. Great heaven! I wonder If any dar'd to look upon the corpse, And think it would not rise, and so rebuke them, As when his spirit was in it? Oh, the laughter That there must be 'mongst those whom we call dead, At the malice that would reach them! Lady C. Aye, think thus, And bear all patiently. Cro. It reaches us. Lady C. Fearfully! Cro. If we pass along the street, There are the jests and looks of horrid mirth With which men greet the shame of their own nature. To my own door the savage yell is echoed. If my young son should ask me of the cryâ He, whom I've led to look upon the spot Where once his great progenitor's bones reposed Among the kindred glories of the realm, I must lie and tremble, or evade the word, Or bid him go, and seek his monument Thereâon the gibbet!âhear his epitaph In the scoffs of the ribald mob. Lady C. You did not seeâ Cro. See! noâI think that could not be. I loved him, Though our natures differ'dâhonor'd, boasted of himâ Though I could not commend all; rever'd at least In all the piety of filial loveâ Do you think that I could see? The thought's more horrible Than all has gone before it. Lady C. Wretched vengeance! Cro. Had it been Charles Stuart's act, I could have pitied him For the pain of wrath that urg'd it; but it is The cold, deliberate decree of men Who sell their passions to the time will buy them. Lady C. And where may light the next blow of these cowards? We have not talked of thisâwould not believe What was around usâshut our eyes to find Security. You, living, are as helpless Now, as they think, as he they spurn as dead; You're the next trophy they will rear to loyalty. What! have our streets been spectacles of anguish, Torture, and shame, on all that we have lov'd! And you, who have been, nay are, the highest yet Of all their opposites, do you not feel You must fear, or be feared? Cro. For myself, nothing I fear nowâ And in that mood am fit to make all danger Present at onceâstrive with it to the death. Wife! I saw one who has betray'd to me Many, although I never harm'd them, watching Near my own door. Willis!âSir Richard Willis! Perchance, I'll not return; we can send notice To Robert, and to Patience for the children. If they should join us, meet me in half an hour, By our old favorite tree in the parkâthe time Is right for what I seek; and ere you see me, I will know something more of fate to come, Or pay the penalty it asks of me. Be cheerful! What I'd do is a wise rashness. Bless you!âfarewell! [Exit. Lady C. In half an hour!âthe place? Would he strike some blow, sudden as terrible? He is arous'dâhe hath the glance of purpose, Which in him speaks a deed. Heavens! should he perish, What then were we? Ah, self! what should we be Without him? Nothing! what else would I be? Re-enter (looking in previously) Disbrowe, Darnel, and Berry. Ah, I had almost forgotten! Dis. Yet, our aid Might be more welcome now to him, as useful To the deed that he proposes. Lady C. How? What deed? Dis. That must the time tellâbut the nature of it Is not so hard to guess. Here are three swords, And heads that have commanded many more. We know the regiments that are not disbanded Are those the best affected to his person. Were he, or any well-known friend of his, To speak one wordâ Lady C. Why spoke you not to him? Dar. We obey'd your will. Lady C. True! true! would you had met!â But sure the time speaks loudly to me. Still He hates, distrustsâwhence should aid come to usâ Aid for our lives, but by them? Who else are ready To bear him on their bucklers to his throne? Dis. Cousin, there's little time to pause. Lady C. His friend! His true friend that he trusts! You shall have my word, My written word, to Colonel Ingoldsby. Confer with him, and bid him take what means He should for the Lord Richard's safety; he Shall know our imminent straitâconfer with him, And if the need should come, why, act with him, If you will die with us for Richard's weal. Dis. A letter! Dar. Aye! it will suffice for us, And for yourself, it is most wisely thought, madam. Lady C. Without there! Enter Patience. Bring a taper to my chamber. [Exit Patience. Wait me one moment. [Exit Lady Cromwell. Dar. She is ours, and he With her!âshe fain must play the queen again; And so she may, let but our fortunes rise By her's. Dis. But Ingoldsby, he's pledged to Charles, And will advise my nephew peacefully. Dar. His name is to the warrant that condemned Charles Stuart's father. Enter Patience, with a light, crosses behind, and exit. He is Richard's friend, And will obey what he believes his will. More, let us bind but his wife's little finger Fast to our plot, we have Richard; he must act With us, and by us. Dis. Aye, one incautious word, They'll make in him a treason. He'll fight bravely. And he will lack no seconds, when we've shap'd His course for him. Dar. You would have quitted her: Never leave a woman while she listens to you. The letter ours, shew it to Ingoldsby, But keep it safeâit must be our credential. Re-enter Lady Cromwellâgives letter to Disbrowe. Lady C. I there commit my fate into your trustâ That's all I have to give. Richard is freeâ Should peril happen to him, I myself Will, in my son's name, baffle, or avenge it. It is done, and if the need should come, through Ingoldsby, You shall hear of me. Dar. (Looks at the letter.) 'Tis her husband's seal, But being her hand, we have her husband's soul. Dis. We take our leaves to speed in your affairs. Ber. In hopeâ Dar. In surety. May we greet your highness At Whitehall, when we next present ourselves. [Exeunt all but Lady Cromwell. Lady C. It is done! 'tis but myself that I have pledg'd; Let Richard hold to peace! I would win back For him at my own peril, all our fortunes. Why shudder, then? I am ready for the danger My deed may challenge. He will wait meâbe his purpose Safety by victoryâlet us rule or perish! [Exit. SCENE II. âSt. James's Park. Enter the King, Courtiers, and Sir Richard Willis. King. Some services are too well paid, Sir Richard, By being overlooked. Some honest gentlemen Have been suitors to me, not to forget yoursâ But they remember fines, imprisonments Of my best friends, provided by your seal. Wil. I hope, sire, My future life shall proveâ King. That's better, man, And of a pleasanter fashionâI am forced To hear so much that has been done for me; I am glad to find there are some services Left for the future. Good day! [Exit Willis. I scarce know why I should be harsh With that poor knave; there have been rogues on both sidesâ His only fault is that he has cheated both, A pretension traitorous to our vanity; But to be free of knaves, one must be free Of all one's kind. Good morrow, gentlemen. [Exeunt Courtiers. There is but one left now. Richard Cromwell appears. Odds fish! can't I speak truth When I intend it? Cro. (Kneeling.) Do I kneel to the king? King. Yesâbut get up, man, and put on your hat, You can't tell what it is to be pursued With suits from place to place, till all the world Appears of the worshipful company of beggars. I warrant me thou hast something to ask of me; But for thine own sake make no show of itâ Thou'lt keep me to thyself two minutes longer. Cro. I am, indeed, a suitor to your Majesty. King. Aye, I knew thatâspare me the common form; You and your family have lost your all, And something moreâall that you might have had, Upholding my true causeâbut then your claim Is only that of every Englishman, As they have told me, since my restoration. Cro. I, and my family have lost our all, Because we have been your greatest enemies. King. Odds fish! that's new! none have said that before; I'll hear youâwhat do you ask? Cro. Nothing! King. Nay, nay! But that's beyond belief. Cro. I only come To learn all that your Majesty exacts, And pay it. King. Humph! your story? Cro. In my name That's toldâ'tis Richard Cromwell! King. Richard Cromwell! You're bold, indeed! Cromwell! are you the usurper That held my crownâthe son of him who slew My father? You are bold to cross me. Wherefore Come you to me? Cro. I once implor'd my father For your's, sire, though in vain. I crav'd his life, Though 'twas denied to me. King. No more of that! Think you I love the memory of that deed, That I have patience here again to endure The wrongs my father suffer'd! Cro. I do notâ Such wrongs bring me to you. King. What wrongs? Cro. Ah, sire! We have keen memories for the wrongs we sufferâ Oblivion for such as we inflict. I do not tax you with so base a deed, But the parasites that bow around your throne, To the glory of your father's memory, Have untombed my father's corse! King. If it be so, Mere justice; what is done, is done By the law, by such as have the right and power. Cro. Sire! those who war against the dead man's bones, Quail'd at his living look. They are your slaves, Offering a sacrifice to filial piety, To make a pander of your sacred duty And noblest love. It is their expiationâ They are judges, lest they should be criminals, And offer up their sickening feast to fearâ Worthy indeed of them, but foul indignity To you, before whom they place it. King. I forgive much, Feeling your causeâbut, peace! if you have aught To sue for, it were well to raise no wrath. Remember, I'm your king, wronged by your houseâ By yourselfâI would be justâwhat would you with me? Cro. I come to know my fate, and to submit to it. King. Your fate? Cro. Aye, sire, I rather would bear judgment From the king, upon whose throne I've sate, than wait The cowardly, abject, wanton tyranny Of your flatterers, when they seek another show Of death to satisfy the blood-loving idol They make of loyalty. I come to hear My doom from yourself. King. Let your own actions guard you, If you are free from the past. Cro. But there are such As frame the past, sire, to their own devices. I do not come to you in abject terrorâ I speak not for myself;âor death, or exile, Or close imprisonmentâI am here to bear it; But there's a justice you will not deny To the innocent wife, and children, who await From day to day my fate, that they may know it, And have their peace, though it be that of woe, Suffer'd and pastâfor their sakes, I would know The doom that is their's through me. King. Humph! you are proud, But you have beenâyou pleaded for my father. You might have spoken in a gentler strain, But you have said some truth. With the same honesty Answer my question. I require of you No hateful, no unmanly services; There are enough who seek them, but your person May be the centre of my enemies' plots. Have I your free allegiance, such as subject Should render to his king? Have I your honor, Such as a man should give his fellow man, For faith to me? Cro. I pledge them, sire. King. You shall not Be the victim that you dread. They shall not ask it; Or if they do, it sha'n't be in my power To yield itâis that safety? I will give you, Under my hand, remission for all past, And a free passport that none question you. We're friends For the future. Well! you're satisfied?âwe're friends Cro. May I not disgrace the title? King. I must write This passportâcome with me. Cro. Sire, I would shun All observation, which to me is danger, If in the passport that your Majesty grants me You would call me by some other name than Cromwellâ King. Say the halfâMaster Crumbâbeing but a fragment Of what you wereâor, if that be too near, You shall beâMaster Clarke. Cro. I thank your Majesty. King. Walk with me, by me, so that we're not notedâ For when I strive to do an honest act, I'm sure of interruption if they find me. What! I have heard of you more kindly things You have not urged to me. Cro. They're better urg'd In your Majesty's remembrance. King. Master Clarke! Don't play the courtierâwe are friendsâwalk with me. [Exeunt. Enter Darnel, followed by Willis. Wil. Stay, sirâa word! Dar. With me? Wil. With you? I have seen you Haunting the house where Richard Cromwell lives, In company with men whose aims I have trac'd. Dar. Indeed. (Draws his sword.) Draw! draw, sir! if you'd have a chance For life. Wil. I do not draw; so, should you slay me, Men may see it is a murder. 'Twould be dangerous To strike me here in the precincts of the palace, And there are eyes upon us. Dar. Humph! Wil. Think coollyâ You're a disbanded officer, I denounce you To the next guard we meet; and I disclose The reason of your staying here in London Against the order, where's your chance of life? Dar. You seem to calculate with accuracy. Why do you seek me? Wil. For our mutual service. You see I can be your foeâI want your help, And will show you how to gain by helping me. I think we might act together. Dar. Perhaps we might, sir. Let's hear the scheme. Wil. If we could trace a plot Home to this Cromwell, it might serve you better Than aiding it, and far more safely. Dar. Aye! There is some one comingâlet us walk. Wil. By the streets! Dar. You fear my rashnessânay, well! by the streets. [Exeunt. Re-enter Richard Cromwell, with two papers. Cro. Is she not here? no matterâall is well, I can return now to my home!âah! there! Leaning so sadly! but no marvel! Wife! She sees me! [Meets Lady Cromwell as she enters. Love! all's saved, indeed. You'll praise me As you have promis'd. I have seen the king. Here is oblivion for the past, and here A paper styling me his friend, that none May trouble us with question, or refuse us Aid, as they love him. Lady C. Richard! Cro. Why so pale? Lady C. If Disbrowe?âDarnelâ Cro. What of them? they are nothing To us nowâwe'll forget they ever were; Flee from this place of strife, of turmoil, terrorâ Flee even from ourselves in everything That has been wretchedâeven from the name That mark'd us miserably great; yon bird, That soars up in the air shall not be freer Of the earth he leaves, than we of all that's past. Lady C. Yes, yesâthat's wellâwe'll hide ourselves where none Can know, or trace us. Cro. Aye, where none but those We love can find usâwhere, with our young playmates, We will build up fresh peaceful innocent hopes. No more of Richard Cromwell!âsee, the king Has given me a new name, seeââMaster Clarke.â A title, wife, such as he ne'er bestow'd Beforeâa title to be happy. Aye! To save us, wife! Dear wife! my foolish joy Oppresses you. Come! homeward, Mistress Clarke! [Exeunt. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âThe exterior of a cottage, extending up right side of stageâA garden surrounding itâA small town in the half distanceâSir Jacob and Lady Chubb following Robert Deagle through gate. Chu. A pleasant house you've taken, friend? Dea. Humph! Chu. That is, if you have taken it. Dea. Aye! Lady Ch. Pooh! pooh! I'm sure I saw some better dressed folks aboutâyou are the servant, an't you? Dea. Well, suppose I am? Lady Ch. What is your master's name? Dea. Clarke. [Exit into house. Lady Ch. Clarke! Chu. No great information in that; I wish I could see the people themselves. Lady Ch. It would almost provoke one to go and knock at the door. Chu. Patience, dear! there's nothing like beginning an acquaintance accidentally, if one can but contrive it. One can see what people are; if one's likely to be the better for them, it is very easy to get intimate; if they are likely to want anything of us, why, we can drop 'em at once. Lady Ch. It's very true, my dear Jacob. Chu. âSir!ââsurely âSir Jacob,â from a wife to a husband, Lady Chubbâwe may as well enjoy the title still between ourselves. The king himself is at the hall yonderâa miraculous chance for making one's court, if one had but any pretence for it. The times are changeableâone might do his Majesty a service by keeping one's eyes open. [Darnel's head appears above the hedge. That's the second time that fellow has popped his grim-looking face over. Lady Ch. A most ill-bred curiosity; if he wants anybody, why don't he walk in? [Darnel appears at the gate. Chu. He's coming! we may get something out of him! Enter DarnelâHe keeps near the gate, watching the house, so as not to be seen from itâDarnel and Sir Jacob bow. Dar. I beg pardon; but this pretty rural gardenâhave I the honor to address the ownerâthat is, the occupierâthe present occupier? Chu. No, sir; only an acquaintanceâa casual acquaintance. (Aside to Lady Ch.) Can't say less, you know, being in the man's own garden, whoever he is. Lady Ch. No; get him to go and knock. Chu. Of course, sir, you have business with the occupier? Lady Ch. Don't let us prevent you. Chu. We should never think of forcing ourselves into a party. Dar. My dear sirâon the contrary, you couldn't oblige me more than by taking precedence, I trust, when gallantry is in the question, and to a person of quality. [Bows to Lady Chubb. Lady Ch. If he's not excessively handsome, he's very genteel. Dar. Besides, this is such a charming spot, I could linger here for hours. [Robert Deagle appears at the door. Dar. All's right! [Exit hastily, through gate. Lady Ch. Dear me! Chu. âAll's right!â Then there's something wrong! I shall sift this person. Dea. These suspicious people lurking about here still! I suppose they are the ones that Patience meant; I must affront them if I canâthe best way to prevent other people from being disagreeable, is to be disagreeable one's self. Chu. You've not been long here, friend? I say, friend, you've not been long here? Dea. I've nothing to say to the contrary. Chu. Ah! I knew that. Dea. Then why did you ask? Lady Ch. Friend! this gentleman, who has been knighted in his time, condescended to converse with youâhe doesn't seem astonished. Chu. Cool and harden'd! My friend, I have the honor also to be an alderman of Quidlingboro'âpast the chairâa magistrate. Dea. Well? Lady Ch. The audacity!âfellow, have you been in the habit of seeing such people before? Dea. Not more than once or twice, I believe. Lady Ch. I should have thought so. Chu. Perhaps, you are not aware that I consider any persons coming here in an abrupt manner, without âwith your leave, or by your leaveâânot known to anybodyârather a suspicious appearance. Dea. I was just thinking so. Chu. Aha! then, in plain terms, my friend, I should like to have a sight of your master. Dea. That's easily done, sir; he's at your elbow. [Richard and Lady Cromwell have entered from the house. Dea. This gentleman, sir, a beknighted alderman, desires to see you; he said he suspected something, andâ Chu. No, my friend, no, you're mistakenâthe master doesn't look as if one could browbeat him. Cro. Leave us, Robert. [Exit Robert, at gate. Lady Ch. How respectfully he goesâI should like to teach our town beadleâ Cro. I thought some friends might take an interestâ Chu. Yes, as you say, an interestâ Cro. Sir! Chu. I beg pardonâ He wont be interrupted. Cro. Take an interest In a new comer; therefore, I'm provided With an authentic answer to inquiries. I shall produce it, when I know who makes themâ Your name, title, and office? Chu. He examines me!â Chubb! alderman! Sir Jacob! that is, Chubb, Esq., According toâwho asks me?â Cro. I remember A most staunch friend of the Protectorate, Knighted by Oliver Cromwell. Chu. Yes, I had That honorâor misfortune. Cro. The first name In an address from Quidlingboro' to Richardâ Chu. I had the happinessâor miseryâ Or something, to be mayor. Lady Ch. How should he know So much about you?âask him. Chu. I don't like. Perhaps he has come down here with a commission. I wish I had kept my nose out of this place. Cro. You've satisfied meâI'll return the compliment. You've seen the royal signature? Chu. I've studied it With reverence ever since I saw it written In a reply to the town council. Cro. Look On thisânay, read it through. Chu. âHis Majesty's friend!â His good friend âMaster Clarke!ââaid and assistance âTo all magistrates.â I'm a magistrateânever so proud Before of being a magistrate. Why, his Majestyâ Your friend, his Majesty, is on a visit Here at the hall, two miles offâyou may see it. Perhaps you'll meet him there. Any aid in my power. [Lady-Chubb goes very obsequiously to Lady Cromwell. Good Master Clarkeâoh dear! Cro. What ails you, sir? Chu. I thought how strange that you should be content To remain plain Master Clarke, being the friend Of his most gracious Majestyânow knighthoodâ Cro. Ah, trueâyou've lost it. All don't know what 'tis To have been great, and then to fall from honor. Chu. No, you can guess our feelings. Cro. Pretty well. Lady Ch. One misses it, when one's used to it, like flannel. Lady C. (With meaning, to Cromwell.) I confess I never saw the worth of honor so plainly before. Lady Ch. How should you, dearest madam? Chu. Not that we ought to car for titles given By such a man as Oliverâa man That all the world must ownâ Crom. Made some mistakes Sometimes when he conferr'd them: let his memory Be spoken of by such as care for it. Chu. Aye! aye! Lady Ch. Perhaps a very well-meaning manâ Only misled. Chu. Humph! Crom. Humph! Lady Ch. Poor Richard Cromwell! Cro. We may say what we please of him. Chu. To be sure we may, And some of us have cause. Some who stand here. When I was forc'd against my will to take An address from Quidlingboro, I was sent back Without a look or word. I should'nt have known him From you. Cro. But was not that your own fault? surely You might have look'd. Chu. Look'd! you were never at court, That is, in his timeâjust kiss handsâpass onâ An ostentatious, insolent, shallow person! Offended our borough deeplyâas a royalist I am proud to declare to King Charles's friendâ Lady C. Nay! nay! Cro. Pity to interrupt such eloquence. Chu. These are the things that change political feelings. Cro. I believe you are right there. Chu. Right! to be sure I am. Who cares about parties, that has all he wants? Cro. A party's but a number, striving to get In a body, what each can't get by himself. Chu. Exactly, you must have seen something of them. Cro. Why, yes. Lady C. How he us'd us about that baronetcy That was promised! Cro. Promis'd! Chu. Aye, aye, never mind! That would'nt be worth much now, but for this Richardâ Lady C. I pray you! Cro. Let us hear him. Lady C. You regard not Richard as I doâtrue, you have less causeâ He never lov'd you as me. Lady Ch. How very imprudent To say that to his face!âhe don't seem angry! Chu. He has'nt the common feelings of a husband! Lady C. If we talk of Richard, be it very kindly! For even his enemies must acknowledge thisâ They made themselves so, he ne'er wrong'd even them! And Malice crying out upon his faults, Must take good heed she do not blame his virtues. For all that can be laid to Richard's charge Is, that he lov'd all better than himself! And yet kept for himself the noblest treasureâ A soul unstain'd! Cro. You did not always think So well of him. I've heard you blame his judgment. Chu. His judgment? oh! we said in the town council From the first he was not overwise. Lady C. Town council! But I should think the wisdom of town councils Is just what would condemn him? Chu. Yes, we're shrewd! Cro. Pray you, walk inâwe'll follow you. Chu. (Aside to Lady Chubb.) Strange people! They won't blame anybody; you heard how she said âTown Council?â Lady Ch. Aye, I've often said you wanted A woman there to teach you what to do. Chu. We shall find out something here. Cro. Pray you walk on. [Enter Deagle. Dea. (Whispers.) Sir, sir, may I beg your ear a moment! Cro. How! Chu. More mysteries! he's surpris'd! Lady Ch. They're out of something They meant to give us. Cro. Lead them in, dear wife! I'll come to you directly. Lady C. Lady Chubb. [Exeunt Lady Cromwell, Chubb and Lady Chubb. Cro. See me alone! I'll wait him here. [Exit Deagle. My wife! There's the first element of true content Won. She approves, and trusts my judgment. Enter Ingoldsby. Dick! What! weary of the court? I'm glad to see you. Welcome! you've come to share our humble peace, And fill our joy to the brim. I wanted some one, As true and good, friendly, and wise as you are, To shew my pleasant household to. My wife Is as content as I am. We've forgotten There are such fools in the world as the ambitious Learn'd in few hours the lesson of life, For we are happy! Ing. Happy! Cro. Aye! come in And taste our cheer! no very sumptuous fare Except two fools, caught, pick'd, truss'd, dress'd, serv'd up, Ready for laughter. Ing. I must speak with you Alone. Cro. Ah! he said so!âwell? Ing. I have received A letter from your wife. Cro. Indeed! Ing. At least It purports so; the character is hers, And it bears your seal. Cro. Why this nice evidence? Say she has written it, seal'd it with my seal, Entreated you hitherâwhat then has she done More than I am glad to know? Ing. You do not knowâ I am sure you do not, what is in that letterâ Your words have shewn it. Cro. I confess I do notâ Shew it me, let me learn. Ing. I have it notâ The man who brought it to me, ask'd it back A moment, then refused to give it me. Cro. Why did you not take it? Ing. He resisted that, And had it come to open quarrel, words Were in it, that for your sake should not be Recall'd! Cro. For my sake? Ing. You'd not take the alarm BeforeâI'm forced to speak out plainly. Cro. Speak! I'm mov'd now to your wish. Ing. Have you concerted A plot with Disbroweâauthoriz'd your wife To solicit me to join in it for your safety? Cro. No; on! what more?âdon't pause, don't hesitate, Speak out, and all. Ing. 'Twas worded hurriedly, But bidding me, for your sake, speak with them, And act with them if need were; I am here To answer it. Cro. It must be forgeryâ A base, foul, trick of theirs; 'tis true, these villains Besieg'd me with such proffers as I loath'd More than their former enmityâinsulted me By thinking I could mate with themâI told them so; This is their worm-like vengeance on my tread. Forget it. Ing. If it be true! Cro. (Crossing to gate.) True!âRobert! Robert! Enter Robert Deagle, at gate. Go to your mistressâsay, that for a moment I beg her presence here. [Exit Deagle, into house. It bears the lie Upon its frontâthey would not let you keep it. Ing. The fellow urg'd it was his own credentialâ One Captain Darnel! Cro. Darnel! did that wretch? Sir, if there needed a full proof of falsehood Of any crime of unheard villainy, I have it in that name. Enter Lady Cromwell. Come hither, wife! Lady C. Ingoldsby! Cro. Aye! he says he comes to bring An answer to a letter he believes He has received from you. Lady C. You have done nothing! You have it safe?âis it destroy'd? Cro. Good heaven! Robert! within! let my black horse be saddled! He's fleet! Deagle appears, and exit at gate. What strange presumption 'tis in man To say âI'm happy!â Leave me, Ingoldsbyâ These reptiles have wound round us with their filmâ Let not the slime touch you. It will be noted That you are absent. Ing. Nay, the king being lodg'd At hand, my duty is sufficient plea. Cro. Begone! we have our innocence alone To guard us. You must shew yours clearâaway! Denounce, if need be, for yourselfâyet sheâ She is destroy'd then! Ing. Teach me how I best may save your fortunes. Cro. Save my fortunes! What have I now to treasure? Save my fortunes! Sir, I have nothing left to save but honor, And that I'll strive to guard myself. Farewell! Lady C. One moment! What has happened? Ing. They've the letter Addressed to meâif you have written it, They will not fail to use it. Lady C. How? for what? Ing. To make your husband partner in rebellion With them. Lacy C. Sacrifice me! Is there no means To do that and save him? Cro. (To Ingoldsby. I pray you leave us. Lady C. Answer me, Ingoldsbyâthere must be meansâ The letter's worded so, it cannot touch him; I had care of thatâaltho' no other heed, I am sure of it. Cro. (To Ingoldsby.) Begone! look to yourselfâ I will not have you staid to your own peril! I will know all the truth, if I may know it, And shall act as fits the occasion. Ing. May heaven guard you. [Exit. Cro. My friend, too! of the few who really lov'd me, Pledg'd to this miserable fate! Ah, heaven! How can I speak to her? She has betray'd me! Betray'd me to the slaves she saw me spurn. Lady C. Richard, don't turn from me. Great heaven! what have I done? Cro. My seal was put To a letter to Ingoldsby. Lady C. Unwitting haste! A wretched oversight! but the same letter Will prove 'twas mine aloneâthey will believe that, Will they not? Oh, my husband! You left me, Richard, And they departed notâthey increased the fears We both had entertain'd. I will not spare myselfâ They tempted my poor vanity and pride. I thinkâI am sureâI had not yielded to them, But you returned while yet they spoke with meâ I saw your passion would not let them meet you; Heard from yourself all my worst fears confirm'd; Saw you depart as to some deed of dangerâ Indeed, it seem'd so then to me; they urg'd me againâ I wrote to Ingoldsby, as to your friend, Bade him confer with those from whom alone Aid seem'd at hand, and tried, though very weakly, To centre all the danger in myself, That I might win your safety, and old honors. I know 'tis poor defence, but 'tis the truth, And do not too much hate me for it. Cro. The cowards! To strike me here!âDear wife! my own dear wife! Come on't what may, I acquit you of all blame; I did not wed with you to bear no weakness, And yours sprang from your love, they tempted thatâ Serpents! Lady C. Oh, heaven! That we had never met! I should have been A solitary thrall to will and passionâ Hapless myself, but not destroying you! Pardon and blessing! for we may not meet Again where I may claim them. Cro. Blessing, dear one! Not pardon; or the word, if you will have itâ Pardon! with all my soul, but blessing most! Enter Disbrowe, Darnel, and Berry. How! do you come to boast your villainy, That you have duped her by a stratagem. That befits!âheaven! there is no name of guilt Hath cruelty and baseness in a word To speak your factâavoid meâ Dis. Your own life And hers, you know it, are now pledg'd with ours, And you must hear usâaye, for her sake! Lady C. Richard! Heed me not. Cro. Go, to our guestsâit is my will And need I should be left to deal with these Alone. Heed well we are not interrupted; Go! but not sadlyâthere's no wrath between us. So, [Exit Lady Cromwell, into cottage. Sirs! I warn youâI have suffer'd much; Tempt me again and try what I will do. I warn youâyou have earn'd a hate which charity Itself can't pluck out of my heart. You seek me For a mortal struggle. Dis. For a mortal struggle, Indeed!âthe ports are clos'dâwe're driven hither For very lifeâto you, our only hope, Which we'll not yield but with lifeâand if we die, We clutch you with us. By that letterâ Cro. Wretch! Do you dare? Dis. We're in a strait that must dare all That deeds can bring on usâspare words, she's bound to us, You know it, and you with herâwill you perish Both, or both live and reign? Cro. I have no answer But thisâspeak to me as an enemy Who owns no faith with you, orâwhich I'd craveâ Be silent and begone! Dis. Can't life, death, power, For her too, win your hearing? Dar. When he knows The truth, the certainty of what we speak. Sir! you've to choose between the throne and the block; King Charles is here hard by at a lone hallâ The owner has a wife, or sister, so The king comes privately, without a guard, Almost without attendance. Cro. At yon hall? Dar. Aye, sir. (To Disbrowe.) He listens! Dis. Cousin! we alone Could make sure prisoner of the King of England, And force him by the peril of his life To give us safety, and whatever more We should demand. Cro. Seize on his person? Dis. Aye! And hold his person, too, against more force Than can be raised to take it from our grasp. There is a regiment quartered in yon vale, On whom, perhaps, the king relies for guardâ The regiment, that was Falconberg's, of whom Every man's devoted to yourself. Cro. Falconberg's! Aye, they were true to me. Dar. And now they are to be disbanded, and their road Must lie between starvation and the gallows. We have urg'd them, in your name, for the brief time Requir'd an actionâspeak, and every sword Is as obedient as in your own handâ Nay, scarcely waits your word to do the deed Shall save all, and enthrone you! Dis. Now, your answer. Dar. (Aside to them.) He pondersâhe will yield. Cro. In the town and villages They have their quarters. Dar. Aye, sir. Dis. Cousin, speak! Dar. If we may take the rest of a few moments, And yonder room seems empty, the Lord Richard Will soon determine. (To Disbrowe.) Give him time to yieldâ That he pauses is enough. Dis. Determine quickly If you need thought for it, lest the soldiers move, And so prevent our leading. We will wait you. [Exit into cottage. Cro. To break my honest word! to join with them! Or see her perish!âwould the king believe me, Should I declare the truth? Dea. (Without.) Stay, sirâyou pass notâ You must speak with my master. Deagle brings in Sir Richard Willis, guarding him with a pistol. Cro. Ah! that miscreant here! Then all is trac'd and known. You are come hither To betrayâ Wil. I? Cro. 'Tis your tradeâdo I not know you? You would sell me to Charles as you have sold His friends to me, but with a bloodier purpose. Speak, spyâand though I may not stain my sword With blood like yours, I'll cast you 'mongst the men Whom you would make your victims; they are here, They shall know you, and you know your fate by them. We are watch'd! betray'd! Wil. You areâone of themselves, Darnel, is ready to betray you. Cro. Ah! And you are join'd with him. (To Deagle.) Let him not stir. My tablets! not a moment! You will give These lines to your lady. Keep that traitor fast And silent. There! (Gives tablets.) They think the game is earth'd. The chace is not spent yet. [Exit at gate. Dea. How to bestow him, While I deliver this? Wil. Keep me from the sight Of Disbrowe and his matesâI have no wish To leave you. Dea. Aye! I'll be secure. (Calls at window.) Hist! hist! Madam! a word so please you. While you're quiet You're safe from thisâstir, it will serve to stop you. Enter Lady Cromwell, from cottage, followed by Sir Jacob and Lady Chubb. These tablets, madam, from my master. Lady C. (Reading.) Gone! âMust be sudden, lest another should prevent me.â Would he yield himself a ransom for my fault? Who's this? Dea. Sir Richard Willis, madam. Lady C. He! Your master bade you stay him. It must be That he would seek the king as once before. He didâbut mine's that office nowâworst punishment To smite my crime in him. Who are those men In yonder room? Dea. They're Disbrowe and his followers. Lady C. They!ânow, thank heaven! surely the true traitors May pay the price of treason, and redeem Those that they would have sacrificed. I'll offer them To the king's vengeance. (To Sir Jacob.) You, sir, are a magistrate; I charge you, by your allegiance, to secure The men in yonder room. Chu. Me! I am alone! Lady C. As you would not bear part yourself in treasonâ As you'd regain the honors you have lost, Secure them! Chu. Mercy on us! What! my knighthood? Lady Ch. Is it possible! Chu. What can be done? Lady Ch. What done? When our title's to be had again! Stay hereâ Only delay themâI'll rouse all the town, The posse comitatus, but we'll have Our title back again. [Exit at gate. Chu. That woman ought To be a generalâbut how to stop them? Lady C. Robert! (To Willis.) You, sir, if you can join for once In a just deed, which wins you profit, tooâ We may count upon your help. Wil. Madam, my dutyâ This gentleman's, if he be a magistrate, Is to secure not only them, but you. Chu. What! Mistress Clarke? Wil. The Lady Dorothy Cromwell, Wife of the late Protector. Chu. Master Clarke! Was he!âdid I?âwhy he was the king's friend; Or was it forgery? that paperâ Lady C. Look, sir! Torn from that very paper, is the pardon Of Richard Cromwell in his proper nameâ Sign'd by the king's own hand. Obey my will, By that authority; more, if you need itâ There's an address, signed by Sir Jacob Chubb, To the late Protectorâshall it to the king? I'll bear it to him myself! 'tis in the house, For my own servants are enough to stay The capture of my person. Will you aid me? Chu. I'll tryâI thinkâwas ever magistrate Plac'd in a strait like this? Lady C. Robert, detain Sir Richard still; he has shown us how to trust him. Secure him, as this gentleman shall show you. (To Sir J.) Remain here with your prisoners till you hear From me. I place our lives, sir, in your handsâ Preserve them, and regain your former honour. Dastards, that made my love the price of blood, 'Tis just it should sell yours. [Exit at gate. Chu. My prisoners! Pray heaven, they mayn't know they are my prisoners, Till I can make them safe. I should like to see themâ If I could bar them in. (Looks in at the window.) There's that grim knave Was here this morning with âAll's right!ââthe others Scarce better lookingâdo they see me? Zounds! They're stirringâmoving to the door! Good lack! What's to be done? [Stands back, unobserved. Enter Disbrowe, Darnel, and Berry, from the cottage. Dis. (To Deagle.) Where is your master, sir? Dea. That's more than I can tell, sir! Dis. In the house? Dea. I think not. Dar. He equivocatesâhe's gone! Speak fellowâis he fled? Dea. I have said already, I know not where he is. Dis. (Seeing Willis.) Whom have you here? Dea. One I am set to guard: Dis. Indeed! Wil. I am known To Master Darnel. Dar. Aye, you are!âshall I say How we became acquainted? Hark ye, friendâ I might have needed you, but as it is, You're happy if I'm silent. (To Deagle.) You refuse To tell us more? Dea. I have no more to tell. Dar. (To his fellows.) We must not waste the time. Dis. What would you do? Dar. Strike the main blowâwe'll to the hall at once. Give check mate to the kingâwe've won the game, Whatever else is on the boardâaway! Chu. They must not go! Sir, I must begâyou see A magistrateâI charge you, gentlemen, Surrender in the king's name. Dis. To what force? Chu. To one, I wish were hereâit is my duty. Dar. Psha! (Striking him down as he interposes.) Chu. Stay them! If you stir you will be met. I've force at hand! Dis. Ha! ha! employ it then. But another word of insolence, a sword May spoil your prating. Dar. There's as great a knave As you could hope for, for a prisoner. Keep him you have, and welcome. Fare you well! Dis. Come, we have but a life a piece to lose, And they are stak'd already. To the hall! [Exeunt Disbrowe, Darnel, and Berry. Chu. What can be done? to let those traitors go Will be misprision of treasonâmy own head Is not safe on my shoulders. Re-enter Lady Chubb. Lady Ch. They are gone! I met them. We are ruin'd. I had sent Two men to the townâI knew what your head was worth If I staid away. Chu. Not muchâbut I'd fain keep it. Lady Ch. To let your prisoners go!âyou might have been A knight again, and Iâ Chu. What could I do? There's one left. Lady Ch. There's a chanceâtake him to the king. Chu. But if they go that way, there'll be a battle. Every true subject will be called to fightâ You know I'm civil, and no military. Lady Ch. You're nothing if you lose this only chance. Take him to the kingâno doubt he is worth something, If they want folks to hang. Chu. Aye, come along! Wil. With all my heart, I would be at the court, If possible before themâfor this Darnel May implicate us all. Chu. May he! Come on! Lady Ch. Keep him a prisoner! Chu. To be sure take care of himâ 'Twould be a pretty errand to his Majesty If I hadn't secur'd him. I hope he'll turn out The greatest knave of all, for our sakes. Now marchâif you go quietly, I may speak A word for you to his Majesty! March on! END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENEâAn apartment in a Nobleman's country seatâfolding doors in centre. Enter King Charles and Lord Hyde. King. Tut! Willis is as many knaves in one As there are parties to be cheated by him. And while you think, my good Lord Chancellor, You're using him, the rascal makes an auction Of the authority you've lent him. Whom Pretends he to betray to you? Hyde. A person, He says, of no mean consequence. King. Ha! ha! Not even a name! You've given the pirate license To run down any goodly ship he canâ He'll find, or make a traitor for you, doubt not. Hyde. I trust his manner, not his words!âhis prey Is close at hand. I beseech your Majesty, If you still trust these matters to my care, To give me leave to treat them as I think Behoves for your own weal. King. Ah! you're offended! Hatch your own mare's nest as you please, my lord, I will not spoil the brood. Hyde. In serious speech, If I may crave that from your Majesty, I have full authority to deal in this? King. Yes, by my honor. Wherefore am I tax'd So sternly? Hyde. Pardon, sire: such a protection As that you gave to Richard Cromwell might Impeach a minister, who must give answer To you and to the country for his deeds. King. Still urging that!âyou make me serious now. I gave my word in surety for his honor. I knew the man at a glance, he spoke out bravely! If he deceive me, punish not alone His deed, but his falsehood; I'll not interpose A word, or look, or thought on his behalf. Deal with him as you choose, and as you ought, If there be cause. Hyde. Thanks to your Majesty For your sake, not for mine. King. Nay, a fair truce. Blame me no more for my idleness coming hitherâ You are welcome to the work of the whole kingdom. Hyde. I but regretted that without a guard, You should trust your royal personâ King. Tush! our truce. Lady C. (Without.) 'Tis dangerous to stay me, sir, for the king; Withhold me notâhe's here: Attendant. (Entering.) I pray you, madam, 'Till I may speakâ King. What means this noise, so near us? Attendant. (Entering.) A lady, sire, craves earnestly. Enter Lady C. Lady C. My liege, Let misery for once break down the bar That stands before reliefâmercy, sire, mercy! King. For whom? Lady. C. Nay, for yourself, sireâfor your state! King. Speak with her, my Lord Chancellor. For you, sir, Look you keep stricter watch. [Exit Attendant. Lady C. Hear me yourself, sire, I entreat youâI come not to ask alone; And what I ask is mercy, such as kings May love to grantâgenerous, wise, not harmful! Nay, scarcely thatâsuch justice as the law Would overlookâbelief in such a truth As it's dull marble ear can't listen to. I know not how to plead my suit to you, Unless you would grant it first and hear it afterâ Though, by my soul, which ne'er conceived a lie, Knowing the truth, as the next world shall show it, You there will bless me, if I win it from you. King. You would save yourself? Lady C. Myself! Sire, you shall see how I would save myselfâ But that is from my purpose. King. Speak more clearly. What would you have me pardon or believe? Lady C. There's a conspiracy against your state, sire, To which they fain would link one innocent; That one they have environed craftily, With every proof that malice or desire Of help from such a power could frame. But grant me The full security of the king's word, That one is free as nought had ever been, And I declare all. Hyde. And what pledge have we That you speak truth? Lady C. One, that so touches me, You cannot doubt it, as I speak it. Hyde. Speak all! Seek not to traffic with the royal mercy; What is fitting will be done. Lady C. What you call fitting May slay my heart, entrap my faith, my soul. Promise, dread sireâwhom with no arrogant speech I'd tempt or anger, they're my griefs are insolent If I offend you. I have but one chance To repair a crime, for so my heart will call it, Against all I should love, 'tis in my prayer, And in your mercy listening to itâhear me, And save much more than life. Hyde. It is your husband You mean? Who is this woman? Lady C. From my agony Wrench, if you dare, the secret I would hide. There have been torturers have torn the body, 'Till, amid shrieks, they have drawn forth confession, But in the judgment day they shall stand clear, Compared to him who would rend a woman's heart To pluck out danger to the thing she loves. King. Nay, do not urge her. Have you more That I must hear? Lady C. For yourself, sire, listen yet! There are those who have conspired against your safety, Your kingdom's peaceâyour crown. Hyde. They are secured In the people's hearts, beyond the reach of treason. Lady C. Have not the lessons of the few past years Taught you to check such boasts? Have none ere now Stood seemingly secure, flattered by words, Such as you speak, to be betray'd by them To a wretchedness made tenfold by past glory. King. Do you taunt me, woman? Lady C. Nay, I did not think Of what those near to your Majesty had suffered. Hyde. I read your thoughts still. Call it what you please, My duty 'tis to note them. What you are, Your speech itself betrays. King. Ah! of herself She spokeâthe Lady Cromwell. Lady C. You have silenced me, Whate'er you would know more. King. I do not fear Aught you can tell or hide. Lady C. Oh! do not scorn me! Despair is a bay'd tigerâthose are banded Who, if they fail, will perish terribly, Grasping revenge beforehand. I can speak And save. King. You have asked for justiceâif your husband Be innocent he is freeâbut to the law His deeds must now be answered, and it behoves him To show them clearly. For me, I have interfered Rashly, against the council of my friends To serve him. Let him look to it. Let orders Be given to secure him to his answer. To you, my lord, we have committed all. Our sole command is justice. Lady C. Then may heaven Declare the truth. There is no other way Than silence. I'll not tell you by a look, Or âayeâ or âno;â you might have spared much blood By one kind, one rightful wordâenoughâI've spoken. Re-enter Attendant. Att. Three men, sire, beg an audience of your Majesty, They say for needful service. King. I will see themâ They may declare what you conceal. Hyde. (Going up towards Attendant.) Assemble What servants can be foundâlet them be posted In the ante-chamber, ready at a word, And listen, and be swift upon a call. King. There are but three. Hyde. (Coming down to the King.) I would your Majesty Were better guarded, though there were but one. King. As you willâAdmit those men. [Attendant goes to the door. Enter Disbrowe, Berry, and DarnelâExit the Attendant. Lady C. Dare they come hither? Would they impeach?âhe said soâsire, those men Are the movers of the treason, which I came To declare and to prevent. Let them be seized! If I speak not truth, fall tenfold vengeance on me, But if I do, though I deliver up Myself with them to justice, that I save you Now from their malice, let it be some claim You will spare him I pleaded for. King. We shall hear The truth now. Lady C. Hear it, sire, from me If you exact it in my blood; I come To yield myself to death, if dying witness May weigh down slander. Dis. Prithee, lady, peace. You waste your words more harmfully than idlyâ We are still your husband's friends! Lady C. My husband's friends! Foul wrong to him to say he has such friendsâ I am not twice your dupe. Dis. We pardon, cousin, The womanish folly that has brought you hither. To sell the lives, can best assure your own. Here is a letter, with your husband's seal, Written by youâenough, if there were need To shew the king whose deed is the revolt: We need but place that paper in his hands, And leave you to his mercy, and were others As weak and peevish with their offered fortunes, As I live, so would we do. King. What would you here, sirs? Dis. Confess, if you would have us, sire, the plot, Of which, it seems, this lady has accused us, And for ourselves, and our confederates, Of whom her husband, Richard Cromwell's one, Herself another, treat with your Majesty For pardon, for security, and means Of living, that may keep us true to you. King. Upon your knees, praying for life, and yielding All you can give to atone what you have done, You might perchance be heardâthese are the terms On which kings treat with their rebellious subjects. Dis. One king at least, sire, might not treat so proudly, Nor can his son with us; we can await The forces which are gathering to our aid, And grant your Majesty time to weigh our suit With calmer temperâbut if Richard Cromwell Come with them, it is in his will alone To make conditions, should they claim return Of the throne in which you have succeeded him. Lady C. Sire, it is falseâthey know that he is free. As we are guilty of this wrong to you, This is some new device against his life, As your Majesty's safety. Dar. Pray you, madam, listen, If I may urge that penance to your will. He left us, but secured the spy who came To search, and thwart our purposesâhe knew From us, at once his danger and his safety. He knows he has friends at handânot only us, But the regiment, Lord Falconberg's, most true to him. King. (To Hyde.) Ah! Falconberg'sâis it so? Hyde. It is too true, sire. Dar. He knows that he will find the king alone His easy hostageâthat the sceptre's his, If he but reach his hand for it. King. Odds fish! Confound the rascalâevery word is true! Lady C. Have I crossed his purpose again? Do I live Only to bring him ruin? Dis. It were well You thwart not his adherents, or reveal His counsel to his foes. King. Let it cost life, Life is not worth submission to these ruffians. Within there! Enter two or three Attendants. Dis. Friends, for his Majesty's sake I charge you, No step, no wordâbut as we give you leave. Sir, know us for no children in this game; We did not come with halters round our necks To sue for grace, but with our arms beside us For pens to write fair terms. Bid them surrender! King. No! Dis. Then I bid these people to note well Your Majesty's safety answers for their peace. We waste no strength on them. Hear you that trampling In the court-yard?âOur friends are with us now. Be thankful, cousin, the event has stayed The mischief of your tongue. Hear you the footsteps Along the hall?âtheir sound may tell your Majesty You have ceased to reign. King. Still I can perish, sirs, As becomes a king. Enter Richard Cromwell and Officers. Madam, you behold the loyalty Of him you pleaded for. Dar. There is no need Of pleading nowâyour highness may command Dis. Long live the Lord Protector! King. Ah! Hyde! Hyde! My folly has ensnar'd me. If I have lived weakly, I must not die ignobly. Which of you Makes the king prisoner?âthere are hands among you That would not spare to wash in royal blood. Come on who will (to Cromwell)âyou, sir, whom I have pardonedâ You, for whose honour my own word was pledged To those who knew its worthlessness, and laughed At my idiot trust in youâa Stuart's trust In a Cromwell!ânow, what would you force From me, your king still? Cro. Justice!âwhich your Majesty Shall grant to me, even in your own despite. Know me for what I amâsirs, seize their weaponsâ There are your prisoners. [Pointing to Disbrowe. King. Say, sir, what means this? Cro. That your Majesty's soldiers, led without commission Beyond the hope to serve you, by a man Whom you styl'd your friend, are come to place themselves, Fearing you need such guard, under your orders. I have served them for a guide. Here's one had led them By the same road to another purpose. Dar. How! Have they betrayed us? Cro. They've example for it, And for less cause. They await, sire, your commands. Dis. Spiritless slave! that might have held the power You proffer now so tamely! Cro. What to lose it Again to such as Disbrowe? Attendant. Another prisoner, So please your Majesty. Sir Jacob Chubb, &amp;c. bring in Sir Richard Willis. Chu. (Between Disbrowe and Lady Cromwell.) Ah! the knaves are there! I beg your Majesty's pardon, but these men Are my lawful prize, captured by me; I appeal To Mrs. Clarke. She was to come to know your Majesty's pleasure, While I was left upon the dangerous service Of keeping them prisoners;âbut for your Majestyâ King. Of course every body will do every thing For meâthat will serve himselfâbut they escaped. Chu. I received a severe contusion falling backwards In striving to prevent them, please your Majesty. King. Sir Richard Willis prisoner! Wil. But an evidence, So please you, sire, whom this wise gentleman Thought fit, thus to secure. Chu. You were call'd a knave By every person present, and I trust Such are worth the bringing. King. Mirror of magistrates! Chu. That your Majesty should deign to call me soâ Now, sir, the power has been so lately yours, And even now seems so little mine, I bid you Still to request, at least, what you would have For those who wrong'd you. Vengeance on your foes Is surely yours. Cro. If it be mine, my liege, Let it take all needed for security, Nothing for wrath. I would pray you spare their lives! My cause till now has cost no drop of bloodâ Let me boast that still. King. It shall be duly thought on. Lead them away! [Exeunt Disbrowe, Darnel, and Berry, guarded. King. Sir, you are now released From your onerous charge. Your name? Chu. May it please your Majesty, My name was onceâif it might be againâ Cro. Sir Jacob Chubbâmay't please your Majesty Only to call him so. My father's sword Laid knighthood on his shoulders, which my fall Struck off again. King. (Knighting him.) Arise, Sir Jacob Chubb! Chu. A hundred thousand thanks to your Majesty. A knight on both sides, that can't be unknighted, Whichever party's uppermost. Lady Chubb! She came up with me, for you gave us hopesâ (To Richard.) May she kiss your Majesty's hand as Lady Chubb! [King bowsâChubb goes to door and brings in Lady Chubb. Come in, good womanâit will break your heart For joyâyou're Lady Chubb again. Lady Ch. (Kneeling, in tears, at the King's feet.) Your Majesty! King. RiseâI would dry all tears. Lady Ch. Your Majesty can do whatever you please With any woman. [Charles salutes her. Chu. I have seen a kingâa real kingâkiss my wife. Lady Ch. This binds all Quidlingboro' to your Majestyâ Chu. As long as the Chubbs outvote the Chuckleheads, Long live the king and ourselves! King. Hyde, I'm a statesman. Had I not given that protectionâ Hyde. Aye, sire, The event is fortunate. King. Very foolish things Have been proved wiseâby a fortunate event A king should have that chance as well as his ministers. (To Cromwell.) But for yourself? What more is in our power To grant you? Cro. Nothing, sire. King. You will not shame My gratitude, or show that you refuse Forgiveness for my wrongâdespise the honors That I can, and ought to grant. Cro. Sire, I am no anchorite, To affect disdain of fortunes or of honorsâ The lesson I have learned is not to buy them At too large a price, and not to fear to yield them When they must be retain'd by other's ill. For my own quiet, as your Majesty's weal, Mine is a private fortune. King. You will return To your rural peace. Cro. Peace would I find it deed, But it will not be here. I am the centre Of ill men's wrathful hopesâto break that bond We must quit our country. King. Self-exiled! Cro. Aye, sire! As child from parent, whom it would not burden, And loves most leaving, may it be at rest, When we are gone, and it's peace long assured, I'll bear the hope, a child's hope, sire, to spend In elder age, a few brief years, where first I drew my breath, and lay me down at last On the bosom that first nourished me, thanking heaven I have not wounded it. King. 'Till thenâ Cro. 'Till then Let me rest still what your Majesty has styl'd me, Your humble, faithful friendâpoor Master Clarke! Disposition of Characters. R. L. Chu. Lady Ch. King. Lady C.
