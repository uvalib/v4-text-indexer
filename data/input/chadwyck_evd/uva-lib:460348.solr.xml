      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE, A Chamber of State. Enter Chamberlain, Bilarmo, Mordivan, Ornuo. BILARMO. Bless'd be this great! this kind Auspicious Day Which lights our Valiant Prince victorious Home! The Brave! the Just! the Conquering Theodorus! His Subjects (in whose Hearts he sits enthron'd) With eager Joy wish for his safe Return, And think the Sun moves slow. Cham. Th'Express inform'd us he'd be here By Three this Afternoon. The long expected Hour Is nearâI hope the Masque is ready. Bilar. I just now saw it practis'd: Their Habits all are on, they only wait His Highness's Arrival. Mordi. Cou'd there no nobler Way be found for his Reception? He who has done such brave Exploits abroad, And from his Country been with-held so long, You welcome Home with Musick and a Song. Cham. Last Night, soon as we heard the happy News, Did not the Streets blaze with continual Fires, And ev'ry Conduit teem with richest Wines? Did not the shouting People and the Bells Vie with the deaf'ning Clamour of the Guns, Which first shou'd tell to Heav'n the gen'ral Joy? So vast a Confluence are gone forth to meet him, The Town's almost a Desart. The Gardens, Fields, and Meadows, are stripp'd bare, To strew with Flow'rs his bright triumphant Way. And must the Court alone want Ornament? Musick's harmonious, sweet, and soft'ning Sound Revives the weary'd Spirits after Toil, And breathes a kind of Balm into the Soul. Mordi. All that Praise can say is short of his Desert.â But tell me, Ornuo, how has he 'mploy'd his Time This tedious Absence? Tho' the Dutchess govern'd Saint-like and well, why did he stay so long From Subjects that so oft (but still in vain) Petition'd his Return? Ornuo. To come the better skill'd in ruling Home, So that Way to reward the Love they bear him. His Age was, when he took his Leave of Moscow, Eighteen, or more; and, for his Time, ev'n then In Wit and Prudence he had scarce an Equal. Six Years he spent at Elvernoy in Study, And in those Exercises fit for Princes, In War to vanquish, and in Peace to govern. Thence did he travel privately, with some Few faithful Friends, thro' the European States: Before 'twas Books, then he read Men and Manners, In which Employments six Years more were spent. About that Time you know (taking th'Advantage Of his long Absence) this last War broke out Between us and the Tartars: How he fought And what he gain'd, not only our own Moscovy, But Europe knows, and crowns with Praise and Honour. Six other Years this War detain'd him from you, For he was still oblig'd to guard the Frontiers, Our chief Commander, and in seven set Battels He did at last reduce 'em. Thus you know His Story, but He's never to be known; His Courage, Conduct, Justice, Clemency, Patience and Truth, exceeding all Example. Bilar. The War, indeed, we grant he cou'd not leave; But there, before, were other secret Reasons That lengthen'd out his Absence to that Time; He'd else come back long e're the War began. Ornuo. 'Tis true there were, and tho' by some Men thought Meer Superstition, as indeed it proves, Yet it was wond'rous strange. Something, he knew not what (for he wou'd say 'Twas unaccountable) made him believe Almost as soon as he first left the Court, He shou'd be most unhappy, if he e'er Went back to Moscow while the Dutchess liv'd. Whenever he prepar'd to take the Journey (As sometimes our Persuasions wou'd prevail Above his Fears) in Dreams 'twas threaten'd still A dreadful Fate attended his Return; So strong th'Impulses were, he thought at last He was divinely warn'd, and did resolve To stay. This made him, when petition'd back, Still find out new Delays.âBut see th'Event, And what small Heed ought to such Fears be lent; His Mother still is living, and he's come With Honour, Safety, Peace and Triumph Home! Enter Torza. Torza. My Lord, the Dutchess bid me send you to her: Amidst this gen'ral Joy she's discompos'd, A gloomy Sadness has o'ercast her Mind, Which she endeav'ring to conceal Makes but the more conspicuous. Cham. 'Tis strange, at such a Time, Her Son return'd with Victory and Glory: But I'll attend her. [Exit Cham. Mordi. Nor must I be wantingâ But see! sad Seraphana does appear, The virtuous, but the melancholy Fair. For many Years sh' has stood a Prince's Suit, Strange! Love in so much Time shou'd bear no Fruit! What End is there of the true Lovers Cares? Or what Reward?âShe loves, yet he despairs. [Exit Bil. Mor. Orn.] [As they go off,] Enter, on the other Side, Seraphana. Seraph. He comes! O Torza! how shall I receive him? Shame and Confusion seizes me all o'er! Yet why, since I am guiltless, shou'd I fear? Curse on the Time I first disclos'd the Secret: Had I kept close his wild Solicitations, I'd been, long since, possess'd of all my Wishes. Methinks, tho' 'tis so many Years ago, I have his Words as fresh in my Remembrance As they were spoke to Day.âO Seraphana! Adieu, he cry'd, thou softest of thy Sex! What wou'd I give for such another Moment! Last Night! O Rapture not to be exprest! 'Twas well thou didst not speak! thy charming Voice, Thy Language, join'd with the impetuous Joy, Had over-power'd my Soul! Then press'd my Hand, And whisper'd in my EarâI shall return! 'Till then I'll wear thy Mem'ry in my Soul, And, for thy Sake, more than for Pow'r or Empire, Pray to come back in Safety. I all the while astonish'd, sham'd, perplex'd, Stood, like a Statue, motionless and mute; I strove to speak, but Fate had ty'd my Tongue, In which Surprize, fearing to be observ'd, He left me. Torza. And you never since heard from him? Seraph. No, Nor durst I trust the Secret to a Letter. Torza. The Time is come, perhaps this very Day, That may resolve the Riddle. But shou'd the Fault lye there where you imagine, 'Twere dreadful. Seraph. No, it can't be that Way neither; Yet I've been tempted oft to give it Credit: For when I saw her next, a conscious Red Stain'd all her Face, nor wou'd she speak a Word, But left me much disturb'd and discompos'd. Torza. Did you not wait in the next Room? Seraph. I did, But heard no Syllable of what was threatn'd; All was still, hush, and silent. But what most Surpriz'd me, was, to find the Duke, next Morning, Taking his Leave of me with so much Rapture. Torza. 'Twas strange indeed! But since you know y' are innocent of all That the mistaken Duke suggested to you, Why has the Prince Berino's Happiness And yours been thus delay'd? Seraph. How can I dare to take him to my Arms Before the Duke his Nephew's undeceiv'd? At his Return, what wou'd he think to see Her made his Aunt whom he believes he has Himself enjoy'd?âNo, I'll my Truth approve, Tho', ev'n at best, unworthy of Berino's Love. Torza. No more, he's here. Enter Berino. Beri. Still Seraphana, still I follow thee, Just as we do our Shadows; At the same Distance you flit on before me, And like that, too, are ne'er to be o'ertaken. Is the long Day at last arriv'd, to give Hope or Despair? Say, must I die or live? Seraph. O my lov'd Lord! my first and only Hope! Thou kindest, bestâ Beri. This is thy Language still, The Siren's Song that leads me heedless on, And makes Destruction pleasing! Suppose, thou kindly cruelâ Suppose a Soul shou'd be took up to Heav'n To see and hear, but hopeless e'er to enter, The Favour wou'd but double his Despair. Thus hast thou fed me with delicious Sounds, While I am still but where I was at first, And lost my Youth in idle Expectation. Seraph. I've lost mine too: I shall come to thy Arms lean, wither'd, wan, The Ghost of what I was when first I knew you. Beri. Well, granting that (tho' yet, I must confess, y'are soft and fair, So diff'rent from thy early fading Sex Ev'n thy Decline exceeds their Spring of Beauty.) But granting what you say is true, it proves your Love Is false; while thus the Sweets of Youth you waste. Seraph. O no, my Lord, you shall hereafter findâ Beri. That Charm is at an End, no more Hereafters: By Heav'n I now will know the very Hour. Lean, wan and wither'd once may be thy Doom, But I'll enjoy thee e're the Tyrant's come. Seraph. Be not impatient: You shall soon (if I Can make you so) be happy. Beri. Witness ye holy Pow'rs! Impatient, say you? That have so long been waiting for the Blessing? Others by Weeks and Days recount their Cares; I am the first that ever lov'd by Years. Seraph. I never knew him yet so very earnest. [Aside to Torza. Torza. You must not trifle; your Design is ripe, And you may fix the Time. Beri. âName, name the Hour! Seraph. To Morrow thenâif then you think me worthy. Beri. Then and for ever!âO thou beauteous Mine Of everlasting Sweetness! grow! grow here Thou Perfume of Arabia! near my Heart! As rich a Vein of Truth, as thine's of Virtue! O cou'd I think (tho' Musick in thy Voice Does dwell) that e'er the Sound of Words, Cou'd charm so much? To Morrow! O to Morrow! Seraph. His Transport fires me too! I feel the Warmth Run shooting thro' my Veins!â [Aside. O Prince! here on your Breast I hide my Blushes. Torza. The Dutchess, Madam. Seraph. Ha! Beri. Unkindly done To interrupt this Parley of our Souls. Who are those Strangers with her? Torza. The wealthy Mirabella and her Daughter, An Heiress that's but lately come to Court, Admir'd for Beauty, but more fam'd for Virtue; The Dutchess does design her for Lord Agnon, Who brought the first News of the Duke's Arrival, And is most honour'd by him. Beri. I've heard of her. Torza. You, Madam, must resign your Place: She now Is Favourite in chief: The Dutchess Loves her beyond all Expression! Enter Dutchess, Mirabella, Adorissa, Agnon, Chamberlain, Mordivan, Bilarmo, Courtiers, Attendants. Dutch. Then all's prepar'd? Cham. Just as your Highness order'd. The Court, like Paradise, is all in Smiles, The Blessing not more gen'ral than the Joy. [Shouting within. Dutch. These Shouts proclaim him near. Go you, my Lord, And from the Palace-Gate conduct him on, For I'll receive him here. [Exit Cham. Be still my Soul! [Aside. O turn the Prospective, and shew my Crimes In a less frightful Form! Is there no Way for Minds diseas'd, to learn The Myst'ry of forgetting? O for a Draught of Lethe, a deep Draught, That all the swarming Images of Thought May quit my Brain! and soft Oblivion's Hand Annihilate my Sorrow! 'Twill not be: [Aside. There is a Fury here, That gnaws on my Remembrance, poisons Joy, And makes my present Woe almost as bad As that I fear hereafter. Ador. Your Grace is thoughtful. Dutch. I am, my Love, my darling Adorissa. Pleasure does more than Grief oppress the Spirits; But when I've seen my Son, I shall recover. Now I'm borne upon a Spring-Tide of Joy, But soon 'twill sink, and keep within its Channel. [Trumpets. Mira. The Trumpets sound: He's ent'ring. Dutch. Bear up my stagg'ring Spirits.âAdorissa, [Aside. Do you retire; and you, too, Madam, with her, Go to my Closet, and I'll streight be with you. Ador. Ha! 'tis as I cou'd wishâyet my Heart heaves, And yearns to have a View!â I'll take my Time to see him, when alone, Here my fond Eyes wou'd make the Secret known. [Aside. [Exit Mira. Ador. following. Dutch. Agnon, you follow, say 'twas I that sent you; And make your Court to the young beauteous Lady. I have propos'd the Match to Mirabella, And she so readily gave her Consent, You need not fear her Daughter's. Agnon. I humbly thank your Highness. The chiefest Study of my Life shall be How to deserve this Honour. [Exit Agnon. Dutch. He comes! he's here! The Joy, and Oh! the Anguish of my Soul. Enter Duke, Chamberlain, Ornuo, Officers, Guards, Attendants. My Son! my dear Theodorus! welcome! welcome! Duke. I am rewarded now for all my Toils, [Kneels. Heats, Colds, Distresses, Absence, Travel, War, Only by kneeling here to beg your Blessing. Dutch. My Pray'rs are heard, you are return'd in Safety! [Raising him. I have a thousand Things to say, and each Wou'd be the first, abortive in their Haste, They all are lost in Wonder and in Joy! Beri. Welcome, my Royal Nephew, Welcome as the Peace you've brought to Moscovy. The Father of your Country! you have rais'd A sinking State to Plenty, Wealth, and Empire. Duke. I take your Welcome, but return the Praise To you, who more deserve it: You have purchas'd A lasting Name in War; Yet I must blame you, Uncle, for your Absence The last Campaign; at that decisive Blow Your Conduct had done Wonders. Beri. 'Tis only Love, that is too hard for Duty, And slacks the Nerves of Honour. This cruel Fair laid her Injunctions on me, And, before her, I'm sure you'll take th'Excuse. To-morrow she resigns the Reins of Pow'r Into my Hands, and makes me chief Commander. Your Highness haply comes to grace the Nuptials. Duke. Ha! Seraphana! What is't makes me tremble? A sudden Horror strikes upon my Soul! Lovely as ever! all things else are chang'd; Her Face is still the same! Time has gone on, And left no print behind!âBut 'twas a Fault; And tho' my Youth might half excuse the Error, Witness ye Pow'rs, I from my Soul repent, And here implore your Pardon. [Aside. Dutch. Ornuo. Ornuo. Madam. [They discourse apart. Duke. I must break off this Match; it shall not be: 'Twill be like Incest, if 'tis not the same; The worst of Crimes, and farthest mov'd from Mercy. [Aside. Then you have nam'd To-morrow? Beri. She has! and O ye kindly Hours be swift! Once the Sun stood, and once he gallop'd back; Now let the Miracle contract the Time, And the Degrees go forward. Duke. He is fix'd; And 'tis not now a time to mention more: Say, that I marry'd her my self, and let Him know the Truth; I that way shou'd repair Her violated Honour.âBut can that Be answer'd to Discretion?âVery meanly. Beside, the Vows made to the beauteous Lady I lately saw at Edrimont forbid me: She governs, nay she tyranizes hereâ Yet I shou'd speak to this forsaken Fair. [Aside. Seraph. He moves this Way; and now, methinks, my Fears Are lesser than they were. [Aside. Duke. You are all Silence, Madam; every Tongue, But yours, has bid me welcome. Seraph. Yet none has greater Cause than mine to do so; For only your Return cou'd make me happy: As when I've opportunity, Great Sir, I'll more at large inform you. Duke. Ha! she advances fast, I must retire. If what is past, ye Powers, meet your Forgiveness, Henceforth I'll better please you. [Aside. Seraph. So cold! thus had it been, had I consented. [Aside. Dutch. Ornuo, you tell me News; In Love, d'ye say? And is the Lady nameless? Ornuo. Yes, to me; I never saw her, Madam. Dutch. In all his Letters, and, they were not few, He never spoke one Word of it to me: But now I'll sound him:âThis Discourse, Theodorus, Puts me in mind of you. What are your Thoughts Of the late Match the Council and my self Propos'd to you? (the Princess of Moldavia.) Duke. My Pray'rs have been that I may ne'er offend you. But since there's no Necessity of State, (Our Allies firm, and Enemies reduc'd) That I shou'd marry her, I beg of you, That I may chuse where Inclination bids me. Beri. But, my Lord, Where the Prince takes a Subject, the advancing A private Family to sovereign Pow'r Breeds ill Blood in the rest o'th'Nobles, and Ambition in all those, who, thus ally'd, Dream only of a Crown. That Civil War Has been the Consequence of such rash Marriages, Some neighbouring States can witness. To be plain, What Fortune is there to match yours at home? A Princess oft has Kingdoms for her Dowry. Duke. Let her's that I shall marry, be her Virtue. When that time comes, (and it perhaps is near) I'll give such Reasons for't, as, nor the Council, Madam, nor you, shall disapprove. Dutch. 'Tis well. Let all be as you please.âCome, Son, a Banquet Waits you within; and after that, the Court shall Shew how we rejoyce in your Arrival. Duke. Lead on.âTho' long you did my Absence mourn, I'll make you full amends by my Return. For Property shall smile, and Trade increase; Religion flourish, and Dissension cease; And all my Life be spent in the soft Arts of Peace. [Exeunt. The End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Enter Duke, Dutchess, Berino, Seraphana, Torza, Bilarmo, Mordivan, Ornuo, Chamberlain, Courtiers, Guards, Attendants, &amp;c. Dutch. Come, Son, sit down. I have not, since you left me, Indulg'd my self in any kind of Joy; Affairs of State kept me employ'd: but now I'll give a Relaxation to my Cares, And revel out the Day.âBegin. The Scene draws, and discovers Loyalty lying disconsolate on the Ground; after some soft Musick he rises, and comes forward: a white Wand in his Hand. Loyalty. What Light is this, that do's comply To shine on such a Wretch as I, Poor, forsaken Loyalty? 'Tis he! 'tis he! he is return'd, Whose Absence has so long been mourn'd! Return'd victorious from Command, With Europe's Balance in his Hand! Tune, ye Angels, tune your Spheres! And Io-PÅans fill our Ears! Enter Interest, and Schism behind. Schism. He's here! curst Chance! our Hope will fail If he's allow'd to tell his Tale. Inter. Hence! Make room for a nobler Race; I am a Native of the Place. [Striving to thrust him out. Loy. This frontless Impudence forbear: I'm rootedâWhat's your Bus'ness here? Inter. Our Bus'ness? haughty Slave, we're come To bid our Sovereign welcome Home. Loy. Who are you? speak! Inter. I, Interest am. Loy. 'Tis Impudence to own your Name. Schi. And I am Schism. Loy. A curse you are! Thou'rt the Beginning of a War: What mak'st thou here, then, now 'tis done, Unless to bring another on? Inter. We have, bold Wretch, as much to do, And are as oft at Court as you. Loy. As Vultures Armies do survey, Thou dost but wait on it for Prey; When Places fall, to watch the Prize, While Merit sinks that ought to rise. But, Serpent, what is thy Pretence For coming here? [to Schism. Schism. To keep thee hence. Where e'er I've been, or e'er shall be, I'll not endure a Spice of thee. Loy. The Magick of this Wand behold. [The Floor opens. Thus sunk your Ancestors of Old: Down, Rebels; down, ye Twins of Fraud; Thou, the Priest, to Schism. And thou, the God. [to Interest. [They sink. Henceforth your cursed Influence cease. And since our Prince loves Truth and Peace, Descend, you sacred Pair; this Wand Your swift Attendance do's command. A Soft Symphony of Musick. Peace and Truth descend in Robes of White. Peace. From Heav'n, the Region of Delight, See! Peace has took her steepy Flight, With you, O Sovereign! to remain 'Till you have done your glorious Reign. Late let the Powr's that Minute name, When you ascend from whence you came, Old in Years, and old in Fame. Truth. Thee mighty Pillar of the State, See Truth descends to celebrate. I too, your Triumphs come t'attend, Of all Crown'd Heads my greatest Friend. Loy. Each Man, 'tis said, when we combine, Sits happily beneath his Vine. Enjoys what e'er was made to please, Health and Plenty, Mirth and Ease. And now (if you approve the Choice) I here can shew you, roaring Boys, Whose Loyalty is Drink and Noise. Truth. Some perhaps may loyal be That have no Love for Peace, or me; Those Bullies seem that giddy sort; But prithee shew us Country Sport. There the Golden Age began, And there is still, tho' weak and wan, The most Remains on't seen in Man. Loy. I willâAppear you happy Swains, And rural Lasses of the Plains; Shew how you live, and what you gain By a righteous Monarch's Reign. Enter Foresters of both Sexes, and dance: After which, one of the Swains sings this SONG. I. 'Tis true we're but Clowns, and laugh'd at in Towns, Where most Men are proud of their Crimes; Of Envy ne'er fail, at their Sovereign rail, And still are at Odds with the Times. The Council's a Cheat, or Taxes are great, Or Loyalty too much in Vogue; Not considering they, who their Country betray, Are ten Degrees viler than Rogue. II. Let us then, my Boys, remov'd from their Noise, From all their Designs be remov'd; From Subsidies part with a generous Heart; The Generous still are belov'd. What Want is come on for that which is gone? We find no Decrease in our Store; For every Pound, Experience has found, Kind Fortune new coins us a Score. III. The Grass and the Grain untrodden remain, Our Prince drives the Tartar away; The Scene of sad War he has carry'd off far, And theirs is the terrible Day. Fifes, Trumpets and Drums, their Sound never comes The Countryman's Peace to molest: Our Time we employ betwixt Labour and Joy, And both are Promoters of Rest. IV. Let Cockneys complain, and slander his Reign, And all his Designs disapprove; The Bumkin can say he's more loyal than they, And ten times more happy in Love. A Female does there kill more than a War, The Soul with the Body does wound: But faithful and fair, firm sound ringing Ware, Is only with us to be found. [Exeunt. Peace. Here you shall never see Contest, But who loves, sings, or dances best: What Happiness that Life attends Which Innocence begins and ends! Truth. And while we here have our Resort, Like Happiness shall shine at Court. About our gracious Prince we'll twine; He the Elm, and we the Vine: Supporting us, his Name shall be Made famous to Posterity. Loy. Of Joys we'll open all our Store, And, those exhausted, pray for more. Each Minute shall exceed the past, Till his unweildy Bliss, at last, Is grown so great, that when above He comes to rest in Light and Love, He sha'n't distinguish his Remove. To us alone the Pow'r is giv'n Of making Earth resemble Heav'n. [Here they retire bowing: The Scene closes upon 'em. [The Company rises. Duke. Such moral Entertainments are not found In foreign Courts; I'm glad you use 'em here. Mirth is so mixt with Decency, at once It does instruct and please. Dutch. These Pleasures done, we'll search for fresh. As far as Heav'n transcends the Joys of Earth, So shou'd the Courts exceed the Vulgar Mirth. Duke. I thank you Madamâ'tis a Joy to me To see you pleas'd, a Pleasure greater far Than theirs for my Return. Dutch. My Satisfaction now o'ercomes my Grief. [Aside. O 'tis too great to last! this Scene will change. I've gone half way To make your Favourite Agnon some Amends For bringing happy News, and now the Time Calls me to do the rest. Duke. He will deserve the Favour: I'm oblig'd In his Behalf. I wonder he's not here. He does not use to stay from me so long. Dutch. He has a good Excuse, and when he sees you Will tell you what I mean. [Exeunt Dutchess, and her Train. Seraph. I must attend the Dutchess. Beri. She must then Have me too in her Train. Where shou'd the Body be but with the Soul? [Exeunt Seraph. Beri. Duke. Ha! I neglect to undeceive my Uncle. But yet 'tis TimeâO here my Agnon comesâ Withdraw. [Exeunt Ornuo. Mordi. Cham. Attendants. Enter Agnon. My Friend! my Brother of the War! Where hast thou hid thy self? My only Grief Has been the want of thee: But now I have thee thus I'll hold thee fast. Were but the fair One here That I so oft have told thee of, I then Shou'd have no more to ask, or Heav'n to grant; My Joys wou'd be compleat. Agnon. And mine are so! or if I've any Grief, 'Tis to be happy before you. The Dutchess (Who does sollicit her in my Behalf) Designs a Match between me and her Fav'rite, The beauteous Adorissa. Duke. Ha! [Starts. Agnon. If you, that never yet deny'd me ought, Give your Consent. Duke. Why, Agnon, have you her's! Agnon. No, Sir. She has declar'd She will not marry me without your Leave. Duke. And that was what she knew I ne'er wou'd give. Agnon. My Lord? Duke. Unhappy Youth! I will not let thee split upon this Rock For want of Warning. This is she, O Friend, This very Adorissa is the Lady I went so oft in Privacy to visit. 'Tis true, I did conceal her Name from you, Which was, indeed, a Fault; for Friendship does Admit of no ReserveâBut do not grieve, I'll find a Way, if Wealth or Pow'r can charm, To make you Reparation. Agnon. O Sir, you are too excellently good! Your Pardon's all I ask. Where you are pleas'd To place your Love, 'tis Arrogance for me To hope Return of mine: I'm glad she's yours, For you indeed alone deserve the Blessing. Duke. Then go my Friend, strive to divert my Mother From importuning me in thy Behalf: I wou'd, if possible, deny her nothing.â [Exit Agnon. How great this young Man's Friendship is, that does Renounce his Hope for me, I feel my self; 'Twere Death to me to part with her a Day; Nor Life, nor Crowns, cou'd charm, were she away. But see! she comes!âSo after a black Storm, Th'unclouded Sky with Wonder we behold, Where late the Light'ning flash'd, and Thunder roll'd. Enter Adorissa. O Beauty! Innocence! O Heav'n it self! For what is Heav'n but a delightful State, Where Sadness is forgot, and Pleasure lives? So where thou art, no Misery appears, We lose the Memory of all our Woes, And thou art the Oblivion of our Cares. Ador. May you still think so: I wou'd be to you That Blessing that you hope: But my sad Heart Does beat another Tune. A thousand Fears Live in my troubl'd Thought, and to my Mind Present a dismal Scene. Give me again, Ye Pow'rs, my Range among the Fields and Groves, And murm'ring Streams, where Innocence and Truth For ever dwell, and their soft Offspring Love, Does warm, and never scorch. Yet why these Fears? Ill suiting with this happy Day at Court, And to my Thoughts of you; who are whate'er A longing Maid that weeps, that dies for Love, Can either wish, or hope! Duke. O Truth! O Softness ne'er to be exprest! She wins! she grows upon my Soul! O let me press thee in my longing Arms! Thus lock'd in my Embraces, and my Vows Of deathless Love repeated, you must own That all your Fears are vain. Ador. So may they prove. But O I am to tell you the good Dutchess (Whose Tenderness to me can't be express'd, For sure she loves me equal with her self) Solicits me with all the Earnestness Passion can frame in the Behalf of Agnon, Who dies, she says, if I deny him Love. Duke. 'Tis true, by Heav'n, he said my Mother mov'd The Match, and was his Advocate to you: But seeing thee, it left me like a Dream. Ev'n Jealousy it self, that mortal Bane, Which other Beauties by their Falshood kindle, Thy Virtue does extinguish; like a Spell, A Magick Circle round thy Lover's drawn, The Fiend can't enter there. Ador. Nor is this all: My Mother, too, has undertook the Cause, Commands, intreats, persuades, and will, I fear, Proceed to harder Treatment. I am lost Unless you interpose. Duke. Lost! Nature first Shall fail, and all the Frame of Things dissolve! Alas! without thee I am lost my self. Thou art my Northern Star, brighter than that By which the Sailor steers! the Point to which My trembling Love inclines. Thou'rt all magnetick! Others draw our Eyes To gaze a While; but take the Face away, Th'Impression's gone: But thy attractive Rays Does fix the Soul; and we no more can move By our own Strength, than Needles from the Pole. Ador. I know not how to answer Words like these: I only know I love, and know I'm true, And fly to you for Shelter from the Storm. Duke. What Storm can reach thee here? [Embrace. Thou'rt guarded by Divinity it self, The holy Sanctuary of Sov'reign Pow'r, And by thy Innocence, the Arms of Heav'n. 'Tis true, indeed, I'm sorry for my Friend. But if our Love, or rather Extasy, Will give us Leave but to consult with Reason, What can we fear? If, as you say, my Mother Esteems you to that Height, she will be glad Of your Advance; at least your Mother will. Or if they both my Passion disapprove, Who dares controul me in my Power, or Love? Ador. O Heav'n! another that were blest like me, And lov'd like me, wou'd be quite lost in Joy! Yet see these Tears, in spite of me they fall. Th'ominous Drops blast all my smiling Hopes; As Moisture that from baleful Yew is shed, Kills every Plant that's near. Duke. 'Tis a Mistake, my Love, they're Tears of Joy. Nature opprest with a too vast Delight Relieves her self this way: Like April Show'rs Their warm prolifick Influence will revive Thy drooping Joys, and make 'em smile like May, With all her Sweets broad blown.âNo more! no more! Ador. I cannot stop the Current, it will flow! My trembling Joints refuse to bear my Weight. O blame me not, my Lord, for leaning here. Oh!â [Weeps. Duke. Ha! sure, my Love, there's Magick in thy Tears! See! I am melting too.âMy Eyes run o'er! I wou'd not weep, but mustâ'Tis wond'rous Strange! Yet there's some Comfort, we may blend the Streams. [Kissing her. Thus mixt our Tears are Emblems of our Minds, No more to be divided.â Look up, my Fair, and dry thy radient Eyes; Like an unclouded Heav'n shine out at full, That I may have the Blessing of thy Beams To warm me into Joy! Ador. You shall, my Lord! My Life! my Royal Love! were I possest Of Kingdoms, Empires, Worlds, you shou'd have all! See! here I bid Adieu to all my Fears, And fly into your Arms.â O take me to you! Here I must live, here wou'd resign my Breath: Dissolving here, I shou'd be charm'd in Death. Duke. Talk not of dying, we shall live, my Love, All Happiness our own.âO let me press Thee thus, and hold thee ever in my Arms! O Glory! Brightness! O Seraphick Form! What Sweets hereafter must Fruition give? I can but now just look on Thee and Live! [Exeunt. The End of the Second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Enter Duke, Seraphana. Duke. Why do you strive t'excuse your self or me? Did not you make th'Appointment? Seraph. Yes, I did. Duke. And name the very Apartment, and the Time We were to meet? with some Commands beside To be observ'd? Seraph. 'Tis true, great Sir, I did. Duke. Well, granting that you fail'd me, (as you say You did) Why shou'd you falsely promise that You meant not to perform? Seraph. For a Design that did not take Effect, Tho', on my Side, religiously intended: For so may Heav'n deny, or grant me Mercy, As I have told you Truth. How you cou'd be Impos'd on so, I tremble to conjecture. What y'ave declar'd does shew y'are much abus'd, But upon me, where e'er the Fault does lie, The Punishment has most severely fallen. Tho' more than Life, I lov'd the Prince Berino; I was resolv'd, till I had eas'd my Mind, And clear'd my self of the Disgrace you had (I know not how) conceiv'd unjustly of me, To shun his Bed as I wou'd shun Confusion. I cou'd not answer it at all to Virtue To Marry him till you were undeceiv'd. Relief at length is come; and now our Way Is smooth, nor shall he till to morrow stay: 'Twill half attone for all his Miseries past, To find me better than my Word at last. [Exit Seraph. Duke. I am amaz'd! to see her Confidence Makes me almost believe her, even in spite Of my own Senses: Falshood has in her Assum'd the Air of Truth, and charms alike. 'Twas not Imagination, 'twas no Dream, But real and substantial, Met with a Warmth as great as that I brought. Let me consider.âIs it not her Interest To say all this? It is; her Marriage else With my fond Uncle falls. 'Tis her own Cause: She is a partial Witness, and must find The less Regard; yet 'twas a cunning Way: But Wickedness does never want Invention. He must not be abus'd.âO Lust! thou Bane Of half Mankind, and Tempter to the Rest, Which ev'n, sometimes, the best but ill resist, And halting win the Day: Happy are those Whose Youth does scape thee. Between Love and thee Vast is the Difference, tho' thy Votaries say (Who rather wou'd be scorch'd than warm'd) there's none: For Love's all lambent Brightness, pure and chaste But thine is a consuming Fire like Hell, And here does light the Flames it there must feel. Enter Dutchess. Dutch. I parted just now with a strange Petitioner! Wou'd you not think it odd for one that's Poor, Yet sees vast Sums of Wealth before his Face, And has the Liberty to take at Will, To beg he may have none? Yet such is Agnon! He dies for Love, yet makes it his Request He may not have the Fair one he adores, Tho' he without her never can be Happy:â I must beg you t'advise him. Duke. Agnon is Wise, and therefore has, no doubt, Reason for his Refusal.â But, Madam, I am your Petitioner As well as he. You but just now were pleas'd To mention Marriage to me; now I own I've made my Choice; and only your Consent Is wanting as a License to my Joy. Dutch. What Chill is this that do's run shudd'ring thro' me! [Walking from him. I feel methinks, a Flatness in my Spirits: My Blood retires to aid my lab'ring Heart, And boading Horrors brood upon my Mind, As Fate were teeming with some dire Event, Just struggling for the Birth.âWhat can it mean? O ye Immortal Pow'rs! you know my Intents Were just, and that my Virtue was surpriz'd: I've long repented, and I yet repent: Accept my Sorrows, and avert my Fears, Contrition ne' before shed purer Tears! [Aside. Duke. She seems disturb'dâBut will not sure deny me. [Aside. Dutch. Yes, Son; I heard y'had made your Choice; but yet [Turning towards him, and smiling. Am ignorant of whom; yet I've been thinking, But know not where to fix. You need not doubt Of my Consent: She who cou'd gain your Love Is worthy of a Crown. Duke. O she's the best And sweetest of her Sex! Description yet Could never reach her! never yet in Dreams, In all the visionary Objects seen, When op'ning Heaven its Glories does disclose, Appear'd a purer Form! By this time you Must needs conceive I mean no other but Your Favourite, Adorissa. Dutch. Horror! Horror!âOh!â [Swoons. Duke. She sinks! She dies away!âWithout there! Help! Who waits? Berino! Agnon!âDeath and Horror! No Creature within hearing! Look down ye Pow'rs, see but how frail w' are made, And pity us! A Flower is longer fading!â Cruel! cruel! Dutch. Oh! Duke. How do you, Madam? Dutch. Just as Sinners do That stand upon the very Brink of Hell; Th'eternal Fire before, and Fiends behind, Just ready for the Plunge!âO I am all O'er monstrous! Conscience, whither wilt thou drive me? I will not, cannot bear itâ'tis too Cruel! [Swoons again. Duke. What dreadful thing can thus o'ercome her Spirits! I'm stiffn'd with the Horror!âNo Help yet?â But she again revives! Dutch. The Pow'rs have found me out! I knew a Day Wou'd come, how e'er the Van of Life did please, That wou'd bring Vengeance in the Rear: Just Heav'n Will not forget, tho' it may long delay. Duke. What do you mean? I stand confounded at This wild Behaviour.âSpeak, and ease your Soul: If Kingdoms are the Price, to give you Peace, You need not doubt the Cure. Dutch. Hear me, Theodorus, hear me, wretched Son! By all th'Immortal Pow'rs, I here adjure you, If thou hast the least Wish or Hope of Joy Here, or hereafter, fly from Adorissa: I charge you think not of her as a Wife! In other things command me, I'll obey, And lick the Dust before you: But if thou In this dost disobey me, all my Blessings I'll turn to mortal Curses, that shall weigh Thee down so low, the Hand of Heav'n it self Will ne'er extend to raise thee! Duke. This Violence.â Dutch. Is to save thee from Perdition! What e'er becomes of me, I'd have you Happy.â Kneel! Kneel!â Duke. I will.âYe Heav'nly Pow'rs restore her! [Aside. Dutch. Now Swear! Swear by that everlasting Faith That we profess, by every thing that binds A Christian Oath, Truth, Chastity, and all That's Pure and Holy, that you'l never touch her Or take her to thy Bed a Wife, or else; (For both, O both are damnable alike!) Swear as you hope Salvation! Duke. O Madam, let me beg you to retire, [Rising. And talk with your Divines; their Counsel will Let in the Beams of Comfort on your Soul, And fix your wayward Reason. Religion is the Balm to fester'd Minds; There's none so wretched, none so lost to Hope, But find it there.âCome Madam, I'll attend you. Dutch. No, no, I am not madâO, that I were! Madness? It wou'd be Heav'n to what I suffer: To Knowledge lost, I shou'd be lost to Grief, No Guilt, or Fear of future Pain wou'd haunt me. I've told you Truth,âthis is the very Crisis On which your endless Weal or Woe depends. Be wise and save your self.âBut don't propose Counsel to me; Physician, nor Divine, No human Means or heav'nly will avail me, I'm past all Cure!â Duke. Horrid Desperation! [Aside. Dutch. But since you are not so, O Swear! Swear! Swear to what I have enjoyn'd you! Duke. What shall I do to save her? [Aside. Alas I've sworn the Contrary! I've sworn eternal Love! I've sworn immediately to marry her! Think on the Doom that's due to perjur'd Souls, And you'll not counsel me to break my Vows, When Heav'n was call'd to vouch 'em. Dutch. Heav'n will pardon, Nay Heav'n exacts it from you; we must shun The great, for lesser Evils. To most Men The breaking of a Vow, I grant, is Mortal: But 'tis a Sin for you to keep it, greater Than Perjury, Blasphemy, Revenge, or Murder, Or ought we hold most horrid! I'm your Mother, Think but of thatâ Duke. I do; But dare not ev'n be Wicked, tho' you'd have me. Dutch. O Miserable! Miserable Woman! See but to what your Disobedience drives me. [Kneels. Here, grov'ling, thus, thus in this abject Posture, I beg you, I beseech you to yield up That fatal Fair to Agnon, or to any, No matter whom, so y' are acquitted of herâ Yet hear me! hear me! hear me! Duke. Rise! O Rise! or else By Heav'n I will not answer you a Word. [She rises. Were it but Life, how quickly I'd obey? But she's my Soul! there can be no Division! Dutch. There can: there must! there shall!âBut Since my Prayers and Tears are all in vain, I assume a Mother's Power: Tho' in Office I am below, in Nature I'm above you, And do Command you leave her. Duke. Let your Commands be possible! Dutch. They are! [Laying hold on him. Villain, they are!âO I shall be distracted! He that can let a Mother kneel in vain, Is an unnatural Villain!âYou shall leave her! Duke. What will my Fate do with me!â See, Madam, speak the Word, I'l sheath it deep [Draws his Sword. Here in my Breast, to shew there's nothing else But that you ask I can or will deny you. Dutch. By any other Hand thy Death were happy!â Instruct me, O instruct me, gracious Heav'n, [Walking from him. T'escape this Labyrinth! I can see No Path but Ruin, and unheard of Horrors! New Worlds of Woe, and Vice beyond Example! O for a Clue to guide me! [Studying. Duke. I was not warn'd in vain; tho' I delay'd My coming long, I am return'd too soon. Something, methinks, prophetical informs me My Death were now a Blessing! [Aside. Dutch. See, rash young Man, to what your thus persisting In stubborn Disobedience has reduc'd you: I wou'd have kept it secret; but 'tis now What you must know; yet, known, you'll wish you had Implicitly obey'd and sought no further. Duke. What Turn is this? Is there a Shaft behind That yet can wound me deeper? Dutch. This Mistress of your Vows, this Adorissa, From whom I've been dissuading you; ev'n she Whose Breast you thought a white expanded Heav'n, Where Chastity was grav'd to last for Ages, Is now become a Sheet of Brothel Paper, To write the Name of Whore on. Duke. Ha! whither now? Where will these Mischiefs find a Termination? Dutch. I need not tell you that above my self, And next to you, I once did love that Lady: In her dear Bosom, I repos'd my Cares, And never mist of finding Comfort there. Now Agnon being as much priz'd by you, Joyn'd in our Love, I did not think I could Oblige you more than to joyn both in Marriage. Accordingly, I've been th'Occasion, oft, Of Interviews between 'em, and prevail'd Upon her Mother to promote the Match: This Day (O fatal Day to all our Quiet!) I left 'em in my Closet, that the Youth Might, undisturb'd, pursue her fair Affection: But some Time after (and it must be Heav'n That did inspire me) I'd a Mind, methought, To listen to their Talk. But O! 'Twas such As told me she must never be your Wife! Unless you are content to glean for Pleasure After a Subject who enjoy'd the Harvest Of all her blushing Honours. Duke. O speak no more! It cannot, must not be! She is too pure to tempt such gross Damnation! Dutch. The Fault is mine, and I the less can blame her: I gave the Opportunity, which still Is half of the Temptation. Now I knew To find at once your Friend and Mistress false, Would give Birth to a Train of Miseries Dreadful to think on: Therefore, to prevent Your Knowledge of their Treach'ry, made me feign So strange a Height of Passion, which I thought Wou'd work on you to leave her. But since, unless you had been undeceiv'd, You wou'd have marry'd her, I've told you all, And hope you'll not condemn me for my Zeal, (Howe'er it might appear uncouth and strange) To save you from Dishonour. Duke. You've told me nothing if you tell no more! What were the Words you over-heard? O speak! Tho' it be Death to hear 'em! Dutch. Weep not, my Love, said he, Our stol'n Pleasures none can ever know Your Marriage being so near. Then why these Fears? O dry thy Eyes, or yet thou dost not love me! Duke. A long Adieu to Friendship, Love, and Honour! They're in this Couple all extinct for ever.â If there's yet more, go onâTho' I'm almost Past hearing any further. Dutch. Not Love, said she, judge that by what is past, The Proof but now I gave you needs no second: For if I marry'd you 'twou'd ruin both. Besides, our Treachery would then appear In its black Form, and leave us no Excuse: Now we in secret to our Joys may move; He shall but have the Look, and you the Love. Duke. She's gone! for ever gone! And all the Sweetness lost that charm'd my Soul! She's gone, and drags my Heart-strings after her! O sharp convulsive Agony of Love! The Soul and Body sev'ring on the Rack, Endure not half my Torture! But they once Will meet again, and reunite for ever: In our sad Parting Soul is torn from Soul, To join no more! No Resurrection e'er Will call the Parts into their ancient Order. O long Divorce! O final Separation! Where is that Subject now in all my Empire So wretched?â And yet, O Heav'n, to think how oft she has sworn She wou'd be true; with how much Earnestness She sigh'd her Vows!âConfusion! Pain and Torture! Why shou'd I so fondly give it Credit? Patience, when so much Sanctity's traduc'd, Were Tameness not a Virtue! Dutch. How, Theodorus?â Duke. You but just now seem'd lost in Guilt and Horror: How cou'd her Falshood so far influence you To swoon, and rave, and talk so of Despair? If that was feign'd, how can I think this real? Ev'n in your present Blushes I can see Something you've yet not told me. Dutch. I've told, I find, too much already, since You make no better Use on't; And if I blush 'tis at your want of Duty.â But disbelieve me, if you please, and marry her: I have discharg'd my Conscience. [Going. Duke. O stay! It was an impious Thought to doubt you! Yet had I heard the News from any other, I'd thought it false as Hell! and I must yet Desire ev'n you to bind it with an Oath, Some Imprecation that may leave behind No Room for Disbelief. Dutch. Then hear me Heav'n, and so in Death reward me As I have told you Truth. Duke. Enough, no more, you've struck my Shackles off. Her Smiles, in all Eyes else begetting Love, Shall lose on me their Force and quick'ning Pow'r, As the Sun hardens Clay, and makes it steril. My Soul is now at Ease: A Lightness dwells About my Heart, like Men from Danger freed, The Pleasure greater for their former Fear, And tells me I without her shall be happy. Farewel all fond inordinate Desires, That still misguide us with your wand'ring Fires. No more I'll think of Friendship, or of Love, But fix my Hopes and my Desires above: There no false Oath, or treach'rous Look beguiles, But Truth abounds, and Peace for ever smiles. Dutch. Ay, now you make the right Use of Affliction; So Crosses shou'd be borne. Pardon me Heav'n; [Aside, as she goes off. I've done a little ill t'avoid a greater. Some Mischief on poor Agnon's Head will fall, But my Son's Marriage had undone us all! [Exit Dutch. Enter on the other Side Adorissa. Duke. See where she comes! Ye Pow'rs! and beauteous still! The Red and White the same, The right Ã¦therial Hue and Bloom of Heav'n! I cannot look on her and not admireâ O I must shun her, or I'm lost again! [Aside, going. Ador. Come join with me, my Lord, [Pulls him back by the Sleeve. T'adore the Pow'rs that smile upon our Love; Turn not away: I'll charm you more than ever! I have disclos'd my Passion to my Mother, And your Design of Marriage: She, at first, Wou'd scarce believe you'd condescend to make So low a Choice. At last, she, smiling, gave Me her Consent; and said she'd be a Means That we shou'd meet and marry privately, Without your Mother's Knowledge. Duke. O frail and faithless Beauty! You mistake: 'Twas her Consent for Agnonâ How have I been deceiv'd! Who will hereafter, That sees my Wreck, e'er trust in Man or Woman? Rocks on both Sides! The Streights must fatal prove When Scylla's Friendship, and Charybdis Love. Ador. What means, my Lord, this sudden Alteration? Your Words imply some fatal Discontent! O look more pleas'd! Your Aspect else will kill me, And save your Tongue the Guilt! Duke. Tell me (O Adorissa) and as truly As you in Prayer confess your Faults to Heav'n; What think you of my Mother? Ador. That she is The chastest and the holiest of her Sex: Thrice ev'ry Day she, on her Knees, sollicits The Pow'rs divine for Pardon for Offences: As oft returns 'em Praises for their Blessings. The foremost Saint in the most Christian Times Breath'd not more pure Devotion.âWhy the Question? Duke. Can you believe she wou'd be guilty of So black a Crime as Perjury? Ador. O No! There is no Pardon for the Wretch that says it. Duke. Then hear me, Heav'n! If she's not false and perjur'd, Thou art the most unrighteous Creature that Did ever tempt Damnation! Not a Fiend But is more white, and has more Hope of Mercy! Ador. Are you awake! Or am I in a Dream! I hope your Words are distant from your Meaning! This Language is too dismal to be real! Duke. Dismal, indeed, but true! O thou hast stabb'd me in the mortal Part! Invulnerable to all Miseries else. Great but for thee, I only courted Fame To make me worthy of you: Now a Grave, Since thou art false, is all my whole Ambition. Ador. Amazement gets the better of my Grief! My very Wonder does devour my Sorrow, Which else wou'd sink me to the Grave you speak of! Who is it that's so daring to accuse My Looks of the least Breach of Modesty? My Love with the least Proneness to a Change Or any Action of my Life with Falshood? Duke. One that's a Witness to the Breach of all. O Adorissa! 'twas unkind! unkind! 'Twas in thy Heart I treasur'd all my Riches, My present Joys, and half my Hopes of future; They're gone! 'tis only Agnon now that charms, And all my Wealth lies clasp'd within his Arms. Ador. Be you my Witness that my Fears were just. I see my Ruin! And if you are pleas'd, I'll not complain: I only liv'd for you, And I can die to serve you. Yet, methinks, You might have found a nobler Way of parting, Than t'have accus'd me falsly, and make that The poor Pretence to leave me. I always thought my self unworthy of you, And do so now, and therefore will not blame you. Be pleas'd I may return from whence I came, There graving on my Heart the faithless Name Of perjur'd Man, consume my self with Sorrow. Duke. Pray tell me, was you not alone to Day, Shut up with Agnon in my Mother's Closet? Ador. I was indeed: Butâ Duke. Holdâ Confirm'd from her own Mouth! there needs no more! There 'twas my Mother over-heard your Loves: You're conscious to your self what pass'd between you: And 'tis, indeed, too black for Repetition. Do not go on in Sin by a Denial; Or if you do 'twill be but lost on me; I'm rooted and confirm'd in this Belief, That you're all Falshood: So farewel for ever. [Going. Ador. Stay, Sir! O stay! yet hear me e're you go! My last Request, and I'll not long detain you! Remember when you first came from the Camp, From which my Mother's House was not far distant, A lonely Seat, in which you much delighted: You found me there all Innocence, unskill'd In courtly Arts, pleas'd with my single State, Which I had strong Suggestions ne'er to alter. You oft wou'd honour me to talk of Love; I heard you, and confess the pleasing Sounds Sunk to my Soul, and made you Lord of all. My Mother then was absent, and I ne'er Disclos'd your Passion to her, nor my own; Fearing th'Event wou'd be as now it proves, I thought it best conceal'd. How often did we pass the live-long Night In Stories of our Love? And been surpriz'd To see the rising Morn, when we believ'd The Ev'ning but begun? O blissful State! No earthly Joy; it was a Glimpse of Heav'n! Sometimes I wept because I fear'd your Faith, But then you'd swear again you wou'd be true, And keep me at the Price of all your Crowns. Duke. O 'tis all true! and 'twas a heav'nly Time! Ador. Remember then I told you (when you made Me promise you to meet you here at Mosco) That when the shining Beauties of the Court Inclos'd you round, and hung upon your Eyes To catch a Glance; you wou'd forget that e'er There was so mean a Wretch as Adorissa. Prophetick in my Fears, they're come to pass, You've left me the first Day of your Arrival. Yet I'll be bold to say you've lost in me What you'll scarce find at Courtâ For if I am not innocent of all You charge me with, may I ne'er know what Joys Heav'n has in Store for Virtue.âBut farewel! O! can I, without breaking of my Heart, Pronounce that dreadful Word!âBut let it break, Since you will have it so.âA long Adieu! I go to please you. When you hear I'm true, Pray shed one Tear,âfor I weep Blood for you! [Going. Duke. Hold! one Word more! Thou hast a Tongue that makes all Musick vain, Ev'n in thy Falshood charming. My Soul stands list'ning to the pleasing Sound, Stoops to the Lure, delighted with the Call, And courts its own Destruction.â It must not be, 'tis fatal to believe thee! Reason and Honour have resum'd the Rein, And govern with an undisputed Sway: Love wou'd revolt, but with monarchal Pride They interpose, and sever us for ever. Adieu! and with thee all the Thoughts of Womanâ Thou hast undone me! but I'm not alone! Your Sex's Arts thro' all Degrees are known; You ruin from the Cottage to the Throne! We're Suff'rers all; with Adam, Eve began, And ev'ry Woman since has damn'd her Man. [Exit Duke. Ador. Why did I think of e'er returning Home? My Journey ends ev'n here. Adieu all Thoughts of Pleasure, Love, and Empire: 'Twas but a gaudy Scene of painted Glory, That now is clos'd for ever! So the poor Wretch that in a Vision sees Vast Sums of Wealth, and thinks it all is his, With Pleasure views it, turns it o'er and o'er, And quite forgets how mean he was before: Forms in his Mind vast Schemes of various Things, Is great in Courts, and intimate with Kings. But the unruly Joy, too strong to keep Confin'd, at last does burst the Bonds of Sleep: Waking, he finds the rich Delusion gone, And with sad Sighs renews his former Moan. [Exit Adorissa. The End of the Third ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Duke, Berino. Duke. Marry'd, d'ye say? Y' amaze me! Beri. 'Tis too certain. Had you but told me this an Hour before, You had sav'd me; now no human Means can help me. My only Comfort is, I've not enjoy'd her. Duke. Sudden and strange! I thought you talk'd of staying till to Morrow. Beri. I did; but the She-devil has thought fit To damn me sooner! Duke. You are indeed unhappy! Beri. To have liv'd some Years a wedded Life, and then Had Information that my Wife was false, Is such a gen'ral Evil, it has now But few Exceptions; but the nuptial Hour, That very Hour to know it, is a Curse That yet has had no equal. Duke. Think how I've been deceiv'd, you'll not complain; Mine is the harder Fortune. Beri. Say not so: You've lost what scarce you knew, a Year the most Of your Acquaintance; I have serv'd an Age. And must confess I never heard a Word, Or saw a Gesture from her, that cou'd give The least Pretence to Envy to suspect her. So sweet! so fair! my Eyes grew to her Charms, Lost in Delight! and when she spoke, my Soul Stood fix'd to hear!âO that she were but true! Forgive me, Royal Sir, I've something here That pleads most strongly for herâI know not why. Deal with me fairly, is she what you've told me? Duke. False, if there's Truth in Heav'n. Nothing but your Design of Marriage cou'd Have wrung the Secret from me: 'Tis not fair T'expose whom we've enjoy'd: But Silence now Had been a greater Error than the former. Come, lay not out upon her too much Cost; She's but, at best, a faithless Woman lost. [Exit Duke. Beri. O it is more! my Hopes of worldly Joys Are quite extinguish'd. Seraphana gone, By a magnetick Pow'r she draws them after. Is there no Way for me t'escape this Bondage? Yes, a Divorceâ But that shames him and me as much as her; For then it must be known. But I may shun her BedâA sad Relief!â She's here!â Enter Seraphana. O artful Looks! O smooth Disguise! Who'd think her Heart cou'd so bely her Eyes? Seraph. I hope my Lord will not impute to Fondness The yielding up my self before the Day prefix'd. I had no other Way t'attone the Crime Of putting you to such Expence of Time. But I'll be all Obedience now, and Love, Find out new Joys, and Earth to Heav'n improve! Beri. Why shou'd we blame our great Progenitor? He fell, but 'twas where no Man else cou'd stand; Who cou'd resist such beautiful Damnation? But Fiends, they say, like Angels can appear: I'm sure she is an Instance of it there! [Aside. Seraph. At such a Time as this, my noble Lord, To wear a Sadness, will excuse me, if I search into the Cause: My Duty's now To study your Content. Beri. Yes, the same Way as Witches say their Pray'rs, Backward.âThe same Content the rest of your destructive Sex Give to their Husbands; Griefs, Disgraces, Cares, And a whole Life's Vexation. Never yet Did any Female fail to bring that Dowry. Seraph. What have I done, my Lord, to draw from you Such terrible Expressions? Beri. Done? That which nothing but your self wou'd do, Robb'd me of Peace for ever! O cou'd I think that under all that Sweetness There was lain hid, like Snakes beneath the Flower, A mortal Bane, and unsuspected Ruin! Seraph. What is't you mean? What black-mouth'd Villain has Traduc'd me to you? Beri. Villain? Saints themselves Ha'n't more Regard to Truth than he that you Brand with that hated Title. But I now Perceive what has occasion'd your Delay, Your feeding me with Hopes and smooth Deceits, Protracting Time till the great Duke's Return. Had he but smil'd, I had discarded been, And you'd have impudently own'd your Sin. Seraph. O I'm undone! Beri. Thou art, indeed, and with thee thy whole Sex, All curs'd in thee a-new: A second Fall. For who hereafter e'er will trust a Woman? Believing them will now as impious be, As disbelieving of a Deity. Seraph. Yet I'll not tamely fall: The Duke shall know I am abus'd, andâ Beri. Flatter not thy self With the least Thought, or hope he'll e'er regard thee more. Be gone! perpetual Banishment is Mercy. Seraph. The Fate I fear'd, And have so long been lab'ring to avoid, Is fall'n upon me. Give me Leave, my Lord, To plead in my Defence: I've that to say Which will incline you to exchange your Doom For one more gentle.âStay! yet stay and hear me! No Criminal, tho' bath'd in Brothers Blood, But is allow'd that Favour. Beri. Already pre-condemn'd, nothing remains But Sentence now, which thus I pass upon thee. Seraph. O hold, my Lord! If I am not defam'dâ Beri. Forbear! thou hast already been forsworn. He that inform'd me is an Oracle, From whom there's no Appeal for farther Surety. Thou art my Wife (and what Man can be sure He has a better?) As a Wife I'll own thee, But never, never hold a nearer Converse! Sep'rate we'll eat and drink, and sep'rate lodge; Nor shall we altogether live uncourtly: We've Presidents enow of such a Lifeâ The only Way that Wedlock's free from Strife. Seraph. O Heav'n! are these, are these the Joys of Marriage? Remember we were but just now made one: Must we part there where all the World is join'd? O 'tis too cruel! think, my Lord, and save me! For you I've liv'd thus long, only for you, And can't survive without you! Beri. Put the sick Man in Mind he has took a Potion, And see how that will please him. Naming of Marriage has the same Effect On me, and does beget a Loathing that Makes Mem'ry nauseous. Seraph. O that I knew which Way I cou'd relieve you, And fix your Soul in Peace. Beri. I'll tell you: If you my former Comforts wou'd restore, Leave me this Moment, and ne'er see me more! Next make all other Females of thy Mind, Then, tho' you're curs'd your self, you'll save Mankind. [Exit Beri. Seraph. I'm lost! my Innocence it self can't save me! Where can I go? Or how shall I appear With such a Brand upon me? Who that bears The Names of Chaste and Virtuous e'er will own me? In sad Retirement I must pass my Days, Yet ev'n there too bold Infamy will find me: Into the Cabinet it follows Kings, And does arrest the Priest before the Altar. Death is the only Refuge! Lucrece so Got endless Fame, who else had liv'd unsainted. He's here! just tim'd to my Revenge! nor shall His Royalty protect him. Enter Duke. Duke. Ha!âI wou'd shun the Sight of Woman. [Retiring. Seraph. Stay, Sir, you that believe the Sov'reign Pow'r Can do no Wrong. Prerogative shall now No more secure you from my just Resentments, Than 'twill, if you are wicked, from Damnation. Duke. What wou'dst thou, Seraphana? Seraph. Make you speak the Truth, Which Princes seldom hear. My Injuries Make me forget the Distance of a Subject: But Innocence is fearless: Wrongs like mine, Wou'd give the Dumb a Tongue to curse such Usage! Duke. Whither wou'd all this Passion? Seraph. To your Breast, To knock there till it has awaken'd Justice. Tell me (if Blushing will but give me Leave To ask the Question) have you e'er enjoy'd me? Duke. You know I have. Seraph. 'Tis false! were you the Emp'ror of the World, 'Tis false as Hell! You're not so great as wicked! I thought before I' ad giv'n you Satisfaction. I am, indeed, too mean to mix my Blood With yours in Marriage, and as much too good To be your Whore: In that Respect you and The Spittal Slave are equally my Loathing. Duke. You rave in vain, Repentance were more fit. I've but prevented that which I admire You wou'd consent to. True, I did you Wrong, In cropping off those Virgin Sweets, which till This Hour preserv'd, had made thee great and happy. But, in Return, chuse somewhere else, I'll give A Province for thy Dowry: But this Match Is next t'incestuous, and will end in Ruin. Seraph. Doubly accurs'd be she that you enjoy'd! And blasted be the Tongue that has defam'd me! You have th'Advantage: But if I may guess At Fate, you will be quickly overtaken By a more fearful Ruin! Have a Care Your self you're not incestuous! But go on, Traduce, abuse me, trample on my Virtue, The Pow'rs above will one Day do me Right, And when they do, strange Crimes must come to Light. [Exit Seraph. Duke. Her still insisting on her Innocence, Is wond'rous strange! There must be something more, That does enrage her so, than what I know. Ha! I remember there was not a Word To pass between us; I might be impos'd on, If so, I've wrong'd her; but I'll instantly Go find her out, make a more curious Search Than yet I've done, and know the Truth of all. If by a Trick she has preserv'd her Fame, Be her's the Glory, and be mine the Shame. [Is going, but meets Agnon entering. How dar'st thou, Traytor, knowing thou art guilty Of so much Villany, appear before me? Agnon. The Cause I came in justifies th'Intrusion: 'Tis in Defence of Innocence and Truth. You are abus'd, and so am I and she, She most that is most faultless; she whose Worth Compensates for the Vice of all her Sex, Whose beauteous Form, to match her Mind, was giv'n An Angel's Face, join'd with the Truth of Heav'n! Duke. O Hypocrite!âBut thou art known, and now This Smoothness shall not pass. Agnon. Then, Sir, this shall. [Draws. Duke. Ha! Villain! draw on me! I've seen thee brave, [Draws. And therefore will with my own Sword dispatch thee, And save the Axe that Task. [Advancing. Agnon. Hold, sacred Sir! O cou'd you think I'd lift an impious Hand Against anointed Life? No, 'twas to prove My Innocence; for since you'll not believe Me living, thus I seal it with my Death. [Offering to fall on his Sword, which the Duke strikes away with his Foot. Duke. Ha! happily prevented.â Thou' adst better live, than unrepentant fall, For such Assassination finds no Mercy.â But why, rash Man, wou'd'st thou destroy thy self? Agnon. To give you Peace:âMy Death were happy, if It cou'd but make your Life so, and restore The banish'd Adorissa to your Favour. But see! O see! the mourning Turtle comes! In Conference with the Dutchess; happy Chance! If you'll but take th'Advantage to o'er-hear 'em, My Life on't, you will gather something thence, That yet may save us all. Duke. I'll try; but 'tis A Bliss too great to hope! [They retire. Enter Dutchess, Adorissa. Ador. I'm ruin'd! lost! undone! my spotless Name, All that I had to boast, is gone for ever! Talk not of loving me; what mortal Hate Cou'd have defam'd me more? I false with Agnon! And cou'd you be a Witness to the Scandal, With all that Seeming-sanctity and Honour? You know you've wrong'd me, and I will have Right: Living, I'll like an evil Conscience haunt you! And dead, my Ghost shall poison all your Joys, Unless you to the Duke retrieve my Virtue! Dutch. O no! I must not! Fate does interpose. I rather shall endeavour to confirm him More strong in the Belief. Insist no more Upon this Theme; already you've been told Inevitable Bars are set between you, Which 'tis assur'd Perdition to o'er-pass. But to your self, I own I've wrong'd you, own The first created Purity her self, Was not more faultless. But not for Worlds I'd have my Son believe it! Ador. Must I be ruin'd then, without a Reason? Your mortal Foes (for Virtue still has many) I've seen you use with Mercy: And Heav'n knows My greatest Crime to you is fervent Pray'r, For the Continuance of your Peace and Honours. Can such be pardon'd, and I find no Pity! Dutch. She shocks my Soul! It must be so.âThere is No other Means that can prevent her Ruin. [Aside. I stand engag'd to the Moldavian Princes [To her. That he shou'd marry there: Beside, both States Approve the Match.âLet this suffice at present. But since you wou'd know more, Pray spend the Night with me; I've that to say, I dare not whisper in this common Air! Horrors, that shou'd for ever sleep in Silence, Lock'd up from human Ears! When you've heard all, you'll own my Reasons just: Wedlock with him you'll think the worst of Harms, And fly to Death for Refuge from his Arms! [Exit Dutch. The Duke and Agnon coming forward. Duke. Fly thou to a Repentance of thy Faults, That basely cou'd'st traduce such matchless Virtue. Yes, Adorissa! yes, my Life, my Soul! I over-heard you, and am lost in Rapture! Let this auspicious Hour be ever blest! And blest my Friend that put me in the Way To see thy Honour made secure for Ages! The very Tongue that blackn'd, has redeem'd thee! But O I beg thy Pardon, that ev'n she (Tho' far, you know, a Mother's Pow'r extends) Cou'd make me doubt thy Virtue. Ador. Faultless in all Things else, she err'd in that. But O this Turn does come too quick upon me! It does oppress me! I can scarce bear up Beneath th'unweildy Joy! Am I once more, (O Happiness beyond all Hope! I have you fast, yet scarce believe my Senses!) Am I once more restor'd to your Embraces! Duke. Thou art, and envious Fate no more shall part us: This Night we'll tye the Nuptial Knot, and put Our selves beyond the Fear of Separation. Ador. No, not to Night, my Lord, 'twill be too sudden. Duke. Can we too soon be happy? Ador. Your Royal Mother promis'd I shou'd know The Reason why with so much Vehemence She has oppos'd our Marriage: I wou'd first Hear her.âTo-morrow, as you please, command me. Duke. If there's no other Cause, we will not trust A future Hour with what the present gives us: Life's short, and only Folly waits for Pleasure. Ador. O yet, my Lord, yet if I cou'd be heard, I wou'd defer it longer! Duke. On that Subject Thy Tongue wants Pow'r to charm me. Think no more On what my Mother has suggested to you; I see her Drift; sh' has govern'd now so long, She's jealous of a Rival in her Glory. Sh' has had her Time.â'Tis now your Turn to shine, And all that Pow'r that late was her's, is thine. Enter Mirabella. Mira. I came to tell you the enraged Dutchess Has deeply sworn it ne'er shall be a Match, If any Thing that's human can prevent it. I am To-morrow to retire from Court By strict Command, and take my Daughter with me: But not, on Pain of Death, to let you know Our Place of Residence, nor no one else That may inform you. Duke. Why she's so averse Against this Match, I know not: She has disguis'd The Truth to us: But can you guess the Reason? Mira. Only the Meanness of her Birth; the rest Is trivial, and not worth a Repetition. Duke. I wou'd do much t'obey her; any Thing But proving false to Virtue and my Honour.â O Mirabella! what do you advise us? Mira. To put your Happiness beyond Prevention: Towards which I've made a large Advance already, For Mordivan is waiting in my Chamber. This Night you privately may marry there,â And there may lie conceal'd without Suspicion. Duke. Hear'st thou, my Love! hear'st thou these heav'nly Sounds! Or art thou dumb with the Excess of Joy! Hide not thy Face, more pure for such a Stain: So does Aurora paint the Morning Sky, Most lovely in its Blushes! Mira. Then, To-morrow, T'amuse the Dutchess, we'll go out of Town, But the next Night in Secresy return, And in th'Apartment of a Friend's of mine, That joins almost to yours, lie hid, till you In publick please to own her. Duke. 'Tis done! 'tis fix'd! this Night will crown my Wishes! My Soul, dilated at one View, takes in Whole Ages of Delight, and Worlds of Pleasure! O Madam! O my Friend! O Adorissa! Pardon this Extasy!âI stand, methinks, Like martyr'd Saints, upon the Verge of Heav'n; Their earthly Pilgrimage and Trials o'er, They view th'eternal Transports from the Shore! Glories that blind ev'n incorporeal Sight, And drown their deathless Essence in Delight! Blessing their Change, some to their Thrones repair, Some mount on Angels Plumes, and wing empyreal Air! No less I'm wrapt (freed from impending Harms) With Thought of being folded in thy Arms! In thee almost an equal Bliss is giv'n. Cou'd this Embrace b' immortal, 'twou'd be Heav'n! [Exit Duke, Ador. Mira. Agnon. A Heav'n, indeed, but 'tis a Heav'n I've lost; Nor will I grieve, since 'tis what he does gain. She's happiest there. But O her Privacy I cannot bear! Access may then be barr'd, and 'tis a Joy To look on her, tho' I of Love despair. So when th'Attendant to his Master fills Some noble Wine, that does diffuse around A grateful Flavour, sparkling in the Bowl; He smiles to see it dance above the Brim, Pleas'd with the Sight, tho' he's forbid to taste. What if I tell the Dutchess they are marry'd? It keeps her here; which will at once oblige Both them and me: Then, since it must be known, For ought I see, it matters not how soon: The Dutchess must approve her when a Bride, Tho' sh' has oppos'd the Match in Policy and Pride. Enter Dutchess. Dutch. Heav'n is against us, Agnon; I had else Made good my Promise: But I yet shall find A Way to make you happy, tho' your Fate Looks now with such a frowning Aspect on you. Agnon. I'm happy, Madam, now the Duke is so. In vain we strive to part what Heav'n will join: He has her fast; Hymen and Love have now Mingl'd their mystick Flames, and only Death Can make the Separation! Dutch. Ha! Agnon! do I understand you rightly? Or has some Lethargy benumb'd my Reason? Marry'd d' ye mean? Agnon. This Hour the Knot was ty'd, That makes 'em one for ever.âBless 'em Heav'n, With many Days, and all Increase of Honours! Dutch. Bless 'em, d' ye say? If thou hast told me Truth, They're curs'd for ever! Empires can't redeem 'em! Is this, ye Pow'rs, your Justice? This your Love To erring Man? You shou'd have interpos'd A gracious Arm, to save the Innocent, And not prepost'rously forc'd Nature on To such abhorr'd Pollution! Agnon. Ha! I've hurt, instead of helping. [Aside. Dutch. I must dissemble, if I wou'd know more! Tho' Death were now more easy! [Aside. Studies. âI've thought on't, Agnon, and will now no more Oppose yon Sov'reign Will: There 'twas the Match Seems to be made; 'twou'd be Impiety For me to frown, where Heav'n is pleas'd to smile. But pray where were they marry'd? And by whom? Agnon. By Mordivan, in Mirabella's Lodgings. Dutch. What? And she was consenting to't? Agnon. She was. Dutch. Confusion seize her Soul! [Aside. I cannot blame her, 'twas for their Advance.â And did you see the Nuptial Rites perform'd? Agnon. No, Madam. Dutch. Then, perhaps, you've misinform'd me! [Joyfully. Agnon. You may depend on't, Madam, for a Truth. Dutch. Go to 'em, then; tell 'em I am compos'd, And reconcil'd; and, if they will admit me, I'll crown their Spousals with a Mother's Blessing. [Smiling. Agnon. The News will be most welcome to their Ears. [Going. Dutch. Hold,âsince you are not certain they are marry'd, Send Mordivan to me;âhe'll find me here. [Exit Agnon, bowing. 'Tis done! and all my Care Must now be to prevent its going further; To interpose between them and their Joys, Now they're broad blown, and crop 'em close for ever! Cruel, indeed, but safe; for 'tis most certain They ne'er must come together! What a sad And fatal Train of Consequences hangs Upon one Fault? Which, tho' 'twas great, was not So far remov'd from Mercy, but an Age Of Tears and Pray'rs might make me hope for Pardon: For what Crime will not Penitence attone? A healing Balm to ev'ry Soul but mine! Mine it leaves hopeless! Heav'n will not look down Upon me with a Grain of saving Mercy! I am renounc'd, cast off, and harden'd now To do more Mischief, to despair and perish!â Suppose I tell her yet, that which, just now, I meant t'acquaint her with.â'Twill be too late, She must inform him too, which Shame forbids He e'er shou'd know! It must be then by Death, There's no Way else to save 'em! 'Tis an Ill Much better than Enjoyment: Heav'n! Enjoyment! Nature, methinks, shou'd start! the Blood turn Ice! Desire recoil! Antipathy swell up To a gigantick Size! and Horror, arm'd In all its Ghastliness, rush in betwixt Their Souls and such Embraces!âAh! see! he's here! Enter Mordivan. The Scriech-Owl's here! who, had he sung their Dirge, Their fun'ral Dirge, instead o'th'Nuptial Song, We had all been happy!âTell me, Mordivan, For 'tis no Secret, was it you that marry'd My Son to Adorissa? Mordi. I had that Honour, Madam. Dutch. Honour? Eternal Infamy and Scandal! Racks! Gibbets! Ponyards! Poison! Fire and Torture!â Be gone! fly from me e'er my Curses seize thee! Thou hast done a Deed that shuts thee out from Mercy! Mordi. I hope not, Madam. Dutch. Hope not, but despair; 'Twill more become you;âthis one Sin has damn'd thee!â Be ev'ry Womb fill'd with incestuous Breed, And ev'ry Age improve th'accursed Deed! Love, Justice, Chastity, for ever cease, And Rape, Blood, Lust, Revenge, and Guilt increase! Be all Laws broken, human, and divine, And all Mankind in one Destruction join! Nor only here these loud Commotions rise, But soaring higher, seize upon the Skies! Chaos usurp the peaceful Realms of Light, And the Sun sink in everlasting Night! The Blest from all their happy Seats be driv'n, And Rout and Uproar change the Face of Heav'n! May dire Confusion thro' all Place extend! Let all be Hell, and let it never end! [Exeunt. The End of the Fourth ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Enter Chamberlain, Bilarmo, Ornuo. Ornuo. Ne'er was so fair a Day, as this has been, Succeeded by a Night so black and dismal! A hideous Darkness, as when Chaos reign'd, Sits brooding o'er the World; so thick the Gloom, The very Tapers, with the Damp, expire! Bilar. And, which was yet more wonderful, (for 'tis Perhaps what you've not heard) to Day at Noon The Sky without a Cloud, and all serene, A loud and sudden Thunder-clap was heard, Whereon, immediately, an Earthquake follow'd, But shook the Palace only; not a House Beside, as 'tis reported, felt the Motion. Cham. To this, then, let me add my last Night's Dream, And judge if all together is not strange. Big with the Thought of this auspicious Day, I went to Rest, and thus was entertain'd: First, the Great Duke, majestick did appear, By Myriads of his Subjects compass'd round; Blessings their Mouths, and Joy fill'd ev'ry Eye! I wink'd, and streight I saw 'em all in Tears! As when a dark nocturnal Cloud o'ercasts The Milky Way, and shuts the glitt'ring Scene; So all their shining Ornaments, put on To grace the Day, to Fun'ral Blacks were turn'd! Their rich Embroid'ry, Purples, Pearl, and Gold, At once obscur'd, and ev'ry Face was pale! I ask'd the Cause, and for an Answer got A lamentable Peal of Screams and Groans! At which, affrighted, I awoke, and found My self stretch'd like a Corpse upon the Ground! [Loud Shrieks and Cries within. Bilar. What Cries are these? Or am I dreaming, too, And palm upon my self these Sounds of Horror! Ornuo. No, these are real.âHa! and still increase! Pray Heav'n the Duke be safe! Cham. They do not come from his Apartment, 'Tis from the Womens Side. Hark! louder yet. [Again. It must be for the Dead, or from the Dying. Ornuo. I've been where I've heard Groans as loud as Storms, And thought it Musick.âBut this quite unmans me!â Why stand we thus, and may be wanted there? It may be Treach'ry levell'd at the Duke, I'll know the Truth, orâ Bilar. Stay, the Prince, his Uncle. [The Cry continues. Enter Berino. Beri. O Gentlemen! what means this shrill Alarm, That pierces only not our Ears, but Souls! Making the Night more hideous, which before Was of it self so dreadful! Cham. We're ignorant yet: But see! where Torza comes, Wringing her Hands, and, with affrighted Looks, Tells, without speaking, she brings dismal Tidings. Enter Torza. Torza. O Horror! Horror! Moscovia is no more! the Pillar's sunk! The Pillar that so high has rais'd her Glory, Is sunk for ever! Beri. Ha! what say'st thou, Torza? Torza. The Duke! the Duke! your Royal Nephew, is poison'd! All. Treason! Murder! Torza. Nor is he gone alone, fair Adorissa; His lovely, virtuous Dutchess, has embrac'd The same sad Fate, and now is dying with him! Beri. His Dutchess! Torza. Yes, they were this Ev'ning marry'd. O the whole Story is a Lab'rinth, where You'll lose your selves for ever! But Seraphana comes.âI dare no further. Enter Seraphana. Seraph. O Prince, we're all undone! Since first the World began, there ne'er was known A Story of such Horror! dreadful Crimes! And a most dreadful Punishment! Beri. Speak on! and rescue our affrighted Souls From this astonishing Suspence! Seraph. Before the Duke Left Mosco last, he did sollicit me For such a Favour as I dare not mention. With Courtship, Vows, and Presents, (tho' I still With flat Denials did return 'em back) He made his daily Batt'ry on my Virtue. At last, tir'd with his Importunity, (For tho' he lov'd, he did not love with Honour,) I inform'd the Dutchess all; who, much enrag'd To hear of it, bid me appoint a Place To meet him, which I did; my own Apartment: The Hour exactly Twelve, the Chamber dark, And not a Word to pass on either Side. For so her Highness order'd, that she might, Calling for Lights, surprize him! The fatal Hour arriv'd: The Dutchess plac'd Her self there to receive him, with Intent To reprimand him sharply on Conviction, For such licentious Courses. Thus, expecting His coming long, (as she but now inform'd me) Light Fancies touch'd her Breast, a Warmth succeeded, Which, by insensible Degrees, at last Ripen'd into Desire.âHere the Duke Ent'ring, and taking her for me, seiz'd on her, With many an eager Kiss; while she, unable To speak, or to resist, Permitted him to ruin her for ever! Beri. Amazing! monstrous! most stupendous Crime! Seraph. Had it stopp'd here, it never had been known, And I had been depriv'd of you for ever! But she conceives; and brought a Dress in Fashion, That from all mortal Eyes conceal'd her Shame; And safely was deliver'd of a Daughter. Beri. Unnatural! fearful! horrid, and unchristian! Seraph. O that's not all! the most surprizing Part Is yet behind!âThis wretched, wretched Daughter! She had by her own Son, this very Night Was marry'd, wedded, bedded, to her Father! Beri. Stop where thou art, for I can hear no more! O wretched Pair! O most prepost'rous Union! Cham. But what of Poison? Torza brought us Word The Royal Duke was poison'd! Seraph. 'Tis too certain! By his own Mother's Hand! Beri. Yet, yet more horrid! What cou'd prevail on her to do a Deed So black and damnable? And murder him She had her self ensnar'd? For he, it seems, Was ignorant, as of the former Incest, So of this sad Alliance! Seraph. Finding it wou'd be hard to break the Match, She did design To-morrow to remove her To some Retreat the Duke shou'd never know of: Of which he having been before inform'd, This Ev'ning marry'd her; yet 'twas not done So privately, but that the Dutchess heard on't: And, feigning she was pleas'd and reconcil'd, Came to 'em, bless'd 'em, danc'd and revell'd with 'em; And while the flowing Wine went freely round, She privately spic'd both their Bowls with Poison, And afterwards her own; fully resolv'd Ne'er to have told who was the wretched Author. Beri. What cou'd her Meaning be for that? Seraph. To keep her Shame from being known, and to prevent Their being guilty of a sadder Ruin. At last she took her Leave; and order'd me In less than half an Hour to attend her, Thinking the Poison wou'd, undoubtedly, Have had its full Effect before they bedded. But when I came, and told her they were laid, Lost in Amazement, Terror, and Despair, She cou'd no longer keep the Secret in, But made a full Discov'ry, as you've heard, And bid me fly to save 'em! Affrighted, I ran back, and with loud Cries, The Prologue to their Fate, broke in upon 'em, And told 'em all! When, leaping from the Bed, Confounded and amaz'd, there streight began A most distracted Scene! Shrieks, Swoons, and Groans, Was all the Entertainment! Horror ne'er Appear'd in so much ghastly Pomp before! Their being poison'd scarce had their Regard; They took not the least Notice they were dying! The other dreadful Mischief sway'd in chief, And all their Pain was swallow'd in their Grief! Enter the Duke, supported; Agnon, Mirabella, Attendants, &amp;c. Duke. O give me no more Antidotes! 'tis pastâ All human Help is vain!âHave you yet found Out Mirabella? She's the only Hope We have left to save us. Cham. She's here t'attend you. Duke. My Time is short, and must not now be squander'd In idle Questions.âI adjure you tell me If Adorissa is your Daughter; speak the Truth; Your Heav'n or Hell depends upon your Answer. Mira. My Lord she is not. Duke. Sink not yet, my Soul!â Tho' now the Precipice beneath looks dreadful. Ah! why then had you not inform'd us of it? What End cou'd'st thou propose from joining us, But sev'ring of thy self from Hope of Mercy? Mira. Much about nine Months after you left Mosco, (Being then in Town) I had a Daughter born: That very Ev'ning The Dutchess came to me, to let me know Her Sister Flavia (who, about that Time, You may remember, dy'd,) was privately Deliver'd of a Daughter; but wou'd ne'er In Life or Death, disclose who was the Father: Which made her Highness think, that, of his Side, The Parentage was mean. However, to conceal her Sister's Shame, She begg'd of me to give out, I had Twins; And, heaping Riches on me, made me swear I always shou'd acknowledge her my own. My Husband, just before, was sent upon Some Embassy, which favour'd the Design: But O! he lost his Life in the Employment. My Daughter, likewise, dying, made me doat The more on Adorissa, who, at last, Grew such a Comfort to me, as in Years, Advancing still in Piety and Honour, So studious of her Duty, I've oft wept For Grief she was not mine; and thought her sent From Heav'n in Lieu of all my former Woes. Now being, I believ'd, but your first Cousin, Joyful of her Advance to so much Glory, And proud to be thought Mother to the Dutchess, I further'd the Affair; ignorant, Heav'n knows, Of her true Birth.âYour Mother only's guilty. Duke. Why does there not break Thunder from the Clouds, And strike me dead! Why opens not the Earth, To take me in!âBut Grief will do without 'em. [Swoons. Beri. O wretched, wretched Prince!âHelp! bend him forwards. I cannot blame his sinking with his Grief; What Atlas cou'd support the dreadful Weight?â But see! he breathes again.â Duke. Again? Do I behold the Light again? Do I yet breathe? Will yet the Grave not hide me? O barb'rous Men! You shou'd have let me go, When Nature was too weak to aid her self; And not maliciously have dragg'd me back To undergo new Tortures! With fresh Pain Again to rack my Body, and to plunge My Soul in deeper Horrors!âProvidence, Whose Blessings reach to all, excepted me, Me only, of whole Myriads; to shew Man How far Man may be wretched! And no one Has yet e'er gone beyond me! I have fix'd The Bounds of utmost Mis'ry!âBanishment, Pain, Poverty, Contempt, nor Death it self, Whips, Flames, and Darts, all Instruments of Torture, All made yet tenfold worse than Fear can shape 'em, Reach not to what I suffer!âTh'Outcast, at once, Of Heav'n and Earth! Accursed here; and there Pollution must not enter! Seraph. Cast not away your Hope, my Royal Lord; you're guiltless: Mercy will attend you in your Death. Duke. Ha!â Since yet you are not bedded, have a Care! Beware you're not incestuously join'd! If some prepost'rous Consanguinity Stands not between you! Let the Registers Be throughly search'd, the Nurses all examin'd, Your Mothers brought to shrift, to swear one Womb Contain'd not both of you! lest you run on To such Pollutions as Heav'n can't forgive, Alike unhappy, if you die or live! Berino. O sacred Sir! have Patience! Duke. Patience, say you? See there! Enter Adorissa, led by her Women. What now can Reason or Religion do? Frighted with that dire Object, they retire, Own their Aid vain, and leave Despair triumphant! Ador. Where is my Lord! my dear-lov'd Lord! For by that Name I yet may call him.â Duke. What I shall call thee, I know not! Language has no proper Word To name thee by! Ruin'd! undone! and lost! Wretched! and miserable! all are thine! Yet speak not half thy Grief! Ador. Afflict not thus Your Soul for me; but arm your self from Heav'n, With Resignation to the Will Divine, And we shall triumph yet o'er all our Woes, By Patience in our Death. Duke. Thy Voice was ever a harmonious Sound! A Melody that cou'd all Passion tame! I feel the Balm distil upon my Soul, And am again at Peace. Ador. Sit down, my Lord, I am too weak to stand; The angry Pow'rs above can't take it ill That I am come to die with you: There is No Incest in that Union. Duke. I was, my Love, returning back to thee, For the same Purpose; all the Comfort now This World can give me, is to leave it with thee.â But what's the World?â All Falshood, or will be so when thou'rt gone. We will not then believe what they have told us, But gently steal into each other's Arms, Unknown ev'n to our selves, forget our Woes, And die as happy as we thought to live. Ador. There's not a Glimpse of Hope; we're misinform'd: 'Tis all too true!âO sacred Sir, can such a Wretch As I, without Presumption, think of Pardon? Duke. You're innocent, my Love, the new-born Babe, If he were conscious of his Purity, Cou'd not depart with greater Hope of Mercy. Ador. We cannot be too sure.âO let us kneel T'implore divine Compassion!âHear, ye Pow'rs, [They kneel. That have involv'd us in these Mists of Fate; (A Maze where Angels wou'd have lost their Way, Had they, like us, been left without a Clue.) If ever I had yet a Thought of Incest, But to detest it, let my Punishment Exceed my Crime; but if you know me chaste, If I am only ignorantly guilty, Open your Crystal Doors, receive me in, And let my Penitence attone my Sin. Duke. They hear! they hear! those Lips ne'er mov'd in vain! [Rising. I feel a springing Warmth revive my Heart, And whisper to my Soul we shall be happy.â But O! a Paleness has o'er-spread thy Face! Thy Eyes, those Beams of Heav'n, grow dim, as if Death hover'd o'er to close 'em! Ador. Yes! yes! I feel his heavy Hand upon me! A sleepy Numbness creeps thro' all my Limbs, And now the Poison racks me!âO my Lord! Is it not criminal to love you still? Dying, I own I love you; or, at least, I most respect you; if that be a Fault, I yet am lost for ever. Duke. Think not so: Thy Love's all pure, refin'd from the Allay Of corporal Aliment, as Angels is, Whose immaterial Essence joins entire.â But O I feel th'Arrest of Death has seiz'd me! One Kiss, and let us take the long Farewel! [Inclining towards her. Ador. Fly from me! touch me not! I'm all Contagion! Our Breath but mix'd, wou'd turn incestuous Air, Drive the Plague on, and blot out all Distinction! Duke. Preserve her Reason, Heav'n! Ador. Have you forgot our horrible Alliance? Wife! Sister! Daughter! Father! Husband! Brother! Was ever there so mix'd a Blood as this!â Pray, pray for me! and O! pray for your self; I wou'd not go to Heav'n, and miss you there.â I'm dying! O Adieu! and witness for me, I beg for Mercy with my latest Breath, And breathe Repentance in the Pangs of Death! [Dies. Duke. Look up! look up! and speak but one Word more! She's gone! and now, as if I liv'd by her, I feel my vital Faculties decay, And Death's dark Curtains drawing o'er my Eyes. Farewel my Friend! Berino will to thee Be all I cou'd have been: And O Berino! Govern uprightly; let no lawless Love E'er get Possession of thee: See, in me, How Heav'n abhors that Crime.âBut I submit, And wou'd not now, methinks, stay longer here, In this bad World, to have the Globe my own.â Thus much to you.âAnd now, my Love, I come! Tho' Fate is partial here, 'twill not be so Above, for there we shall find equal Usage; There Joy and Purity for ever reign, And there our Souls may mix without a Stain. [Dies. Enter Dutchess distracted, held by her Attendants. Dutch. Let the Winds blow: Stand off, and give me Air.â Where am I now? What doleful Region's this? The Seat of Woe and Pain! my proper Home! See there! where Rape lies stretch'd, with glowing Cheeks, Burning in Fire, as in his Lust before! There Murder stands! his Locks all knotted Gore! A dreadful Figure, waited on by all That in Pursuit of human Blood seek Fame. Him Incest follows, coupl'd with Despair, Twins bred of me; Incest the elder Birth, But t'other laid fast hold upon his Heel.â O Hell! Hell! Hell!âBut I'm awake again, And all is but a Dream!âMy Brain! my Brain! Seraph. Try, try Repentance, Madam, call for Mercy. Dutch. Mercy! thou'rt damn'd for having of the Thought!â Mercy to me!âHa! ha!âwhere's Justice, then? Look on these ghastly Objects!âCold and pale! What Expiation can Repentance make For wilful Murder, and for wilful Incest? Delib'rate Crimes!âBut see! they mount! they mount! And take the Right-hand Way, the Path to Heav'n! See! Wreaths of Glory round their Temples shine!â But Oh! the Left-hand Way is Hell's and mine. [Dies. Berino. A desperate Death.â How many perish in a wild Despair, That might find Mercy? Stricter to themselves, Than Justice wou'd? For Mercy's infinite, And is not to be limited by us; To Mercy, then, we leave her.â Never before, in so short Time, was known So strange a Revolution.âAgnon, you Seem most dejected; but don't let the Dead Deprive the Living of thee: You shall find You have but only chang'd, not lost your Master. For you, O Seraphana! whom I've wrong'd, From the first op'ning of this horrid Story, I saw thy Innocence, and will reward it With Truth and Love, and more than now I'll mention.â 'Tis not a Time to think of Nuptial Joys, This Night we'll give to Grief.âAnd may this be A Warning to us, sink into our Minds, And have its full Effect, in bringing forth A strong Abhorrence of all foul Desires; That vicious Actions never may take Root; For if we so will plant,âbehold the Fruit! [The Curtain falls. The END.</field>
