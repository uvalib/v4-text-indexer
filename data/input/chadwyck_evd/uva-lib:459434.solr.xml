      <field name="fulltext">THE MAGNIFICENT Entertainment: Giuen to King Iames, Queene Anne his wife, and Henry Frederick the Prince, vpon the day of his Maiesties Tryumphant Passage (from the Tower) through his Honourable Citie (and Chamber) of London, being the 15. of March. 1603.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A DEVICE (proiected downe, but till now not publisht,) that should haue serued at his Maiesties first accesse to the Citie. The sorrow and amazement, that like an earthquake began to shake the distempered body of this Il?d (by reason of our late Soueraigns departure,) being wisely and miraculously preuented, and the feared wounds of a ciuill sword, (as Alexanders fury was with Musicke) being stopt from bursting forth, by the sound of Trompets that proclaimed King Iames: All mens eyes were presently turnd to the North, standing euen stone-stil in their Circles, like the poynts of so many Geometricall needles, through a fixed &amp; Adamantine desire to behold this 45. yeares wonder now brought forth by Tyme: their tongues neglecting all language else, saue that which spake zealous prayers, and vnceasable wishes, for his most speedy and longd-for arriuall. Insomuch that the Night was thought vnworthy to be crownd with sleepe, and the day not fit to be lookt vpon by the Sunne, which brought not some fresh tydings of his Maiesties more neare and neerer approach. At the length Expectation (who is euer waking) and that so long was great, grew neare the time of her deliuery, Rumor comming all in a sweate to play the Midwife, whose first comfortable words were, that this Treasure of a Kingdome (a Man-Ruler) hid so many yeares from vs, was now brought to light, and at hand. Martiall. Et populi vox erat vna, Venit. And that he was to be conducted through some vtter part of this his Citie, to his royall Castle the Tower, that in the age of a man (till this very minute) had not bene acquainted nor borne the name of a Kings Court. Which Entrance of his (in this maner) being fam'de abroad, Because his louing Subiects the Citizens would giue a taste of their dutie and affection: The Deuice following was suddeinly made vp, as the first seruice, to a more royall and serious ensuing Entertainment; And this (as it was then purposed) should haue bene performed about the Barres beyond Bishops-gate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Deuice. Saint George, Saint Andrew, (the Patrons of both Kingdomes) hauing along time lookt vpon each other, with countenances rather of meere strangers, then of such neare Neighbours, vpon the present aspect of his Maiesties approach toward London, were (in his sight) to issue from two seuerall places on horsebacke, and in compleate Armour, their Brestes and Caparisons suited with the Armes of England and Scotland, (as they are now quartered) to testifie their leagued Combination, and newe sworne Brother-hood. These two armed Knights, encountring one another on the way, were to ride hand in hand, till they met his Maiestie. But the strangenesse of this newly-begotten amitie, flying ouer the earth, It calles vp the Genius of the Cittie, who (not so much mazde, as wondring at the Noueltie) Intersepts their Passage. And most aptly (in our Iudgement) might this Domesticum Numen (the Genius of the place) lay iust clayme to this preheminence of first bestowing Salutations and welcomes on his Maiestie, Genius being held (Inter fictor Deo), to be God of Hospitalitie and Pleasure: and none but such a one was meet to receiue so excellent and princely a Guest. Or if not worthy, for those two former respects: Yet being Deus Generationis, and hauing a power aswell ouer Countries hearbs and trees, as ouer men, and the Cittie hauing now put on a Regeneratiue, or new birth; the induction of such a Person, might (without a Warrant from the court of Critists) passe very currant. To make a false florish here with the borrowed weapons of all the old Maisters of the noble Science of Poesie, and to keepe a tyrannicall coyle, in Anatomizing Genius, from head to foote, (only to shew how nimbly we can carue vp the whole messe of the Poets) were to play the Executioner, and to lay out Cities houshold God on the rack, to make him confesse, how many paire of Latin sheets, we haue shaken &amp; cut into shreds to make him a garment. Such feates of Actiuitie are stale, and common among Schollers, (before whome it is protested we come not now (in a Pageant) to Play a Maisters prize) For Nunc ego ventosæ Plebis suffragia venor. The multitude is now to be our Audience, whose heads would miserably runne a wooll-gathering, if we doo but offer to breake them with hard words. But suppose (by the way) contrary to the opinion of all the Doctors) that our Genius (in regarde the place is Feminine, and the person it selfe, drawne Figura Humana, sed Ambiguo sexu) should at this time be thrust into womans apparell. It is no Schisme: be it so: our Genius is then a Female, Antique; and reuerend both in yeares and habit: a Chaplet of mingled flowres, Inter wouen with branches of the Plane Tree (crowning her Temples: her haire long and white: her Vesture a loose roabe, Changeable and powdred with Starres: And being (on horsebacke likewise) thus furnished, this was the tune of her voyes. Genius Locj. Stay: wee coniure you, by that Potent Name, Of which each Letter's (now) a triple charme: Stay; and deliuer vs, of whence you are, And why you beare (alone) th'ostent of Warre, When all hands else reare Oliue-boughs and Palme: And Halcyonean dayes assure all's calme. When euery tongue speakes Musick: when each Pen (Dul'd and dyde blacke in Galle) is white agen, And dipt in Nectar, which by Delphick-fire Being heated, melts into an Orphean-quire. When Troyes proud buildings shew like Fairie-bowers, And Streets (like Gardens) are perfum'd with Flowers: And Windowes glazde onely with wondring eyes; (In a Kings looke such admiration lyes!) And when soft handed Peace, so sweetly thriues, That Bees in Souldiers Helmets build their Hiues: When Ioy a tip-toe stands on Fortunes Wheele, In silken Robes: How dare you shine in Steele? Saint George. Ladie, What are you that so question vs? Genius. I am the places Genius, whence now springs A Vine, whose yongest Braunch shall produce Kings: This little world of men; this precious Stone, That sets out Europe: this (the glasse alone,) Where the neat Sunne each Morne himselfe attires, And gildes it with his repercussiue fires. This Iewell of the Land; Englands right Eye: Altar of Loue; and Spheare of Maiestie: Greene Neptunes Minion, bou't whose Virgin-waste, Isis is like a Cristall girdle cast. Of this are we the Genius; here haue I, Slept (by the fauour of a Deity) Fortie-foure Summers and as many Springs, Not frighted with the threats of forraine Kings. But held vp in that gowned State I haue, By twice Twelue-Fathers politique and graue: Who with a sheathed Sword, and silken Law, Do keepe (within weake Walles) Millions in awe. I charge you therefore say, for what you come? What are you? Both. Knights at Armes. S. George. Saint George. Saint Andrew. Saint Andrew. For Scotlands honour I. S. George. For Englands I Both sworne into a League of Vnitie. Genius. I clap my hands for Ioy, and seate you both Next to my heart: In leaues of purest golde, This most auspicious loue shall be enrold. Be ioynde to vs: And as to earth we bowe, So, to those royall feet, bend your steelde brow. In name of all these Senators, (on whom Vertue builds more, then these of Antique Rome) Shouting a cheerefull welcome: Since no clyme, Nor Age that has gon or'e the head of Time, Did e're cast vp such Ioyes, nor the like Summe (But here) shall stand in the world, yeares to come, Dread King, our hearts make good, what words do want, To bid thee boldly enter Troynouant. Rerum certa salus, Terrarum gloria Cæsar! Sospite quo, magnos credimus esse Deos: Mart. Dilexere priùs pueri, Iuvenesque senesque, At nunc Infantes te quoque Cæsar amant. Idem. This should haue beene the first Offring of the Citties Loue: But his Maiestie not making his Entrance (according to expectation) It was (not vtterly throwne from the Alter) but layd by. Mart. Iam Crescunt media Pægmata celsa via. By this time Imagine, that Poets (who drawe speaking Pictures) and Painters (who make dumbe Poesie) had their heads &amp; hands full; the one for natiue and sweet Inuention: the other for liuely Illustration of what the former should deuise: Both of them emulously contending (but not striuing) with the proprest and brightest Colours of Wit and Art, to set out the beautie of the great Triumphant day. For more exact and formall managing of which Businesse, a Select number both of Aldermen and Commoners (like so many Romane Ædiles) were (Communi Consilio) chosen forth, to whose discretion, the Charge, Contriuings, Proiects, and all other Dependences, owing to so troublesome a worke, was intirely, and Iudicially committed. Many dayes were thriftily consumed, to molde the bodies of these Tryumphes comely, and to the honour of the Place: &amp; at last, the stuffe whereof to frame them, was beaten out. The Soule that should giue life, &amp; a tongue to this Entertainment, being to breathe out of Writers Pens. The Limmes of it to lye at the hard-handed mercy of Mychanitiens. In a moment therefore of Time, are Carpenters, Ioyners, Caruers, and other Artificers sweating at their Chizzells. Vir. Accingunt Omnes operi. Not a finger but had an Office: He was held vnworthy euer after to sucke the Hony-dew of Peace, that (against his comming, by whom our Peace weares a triple Wreathe) would offer to play the Droane. The Streets are surueyed; heigthes, breadths, and distances taken, as it were to make Fortifications, for the Solemnities. Seauen pieces of ground, (like so many fieldes for a battaile) are plotted foorth, vppon which these Arches of Tryumph must shew themselues in their glorie: aloft, in the ende doe they aduance their proude fore-heads. Virg:—Circum pueri, Innuptæque Puellæ, Sacra Canunt, funem? manu contingere gaudent. Euen childr? (might they haue bin suffred) would gladly haue spent their little strength, about the Engines, that mounted vp the Frames: Such a fire of loue and ioy, was kindled in euery brest. The day (for whose sake, these wonders of Wood, clymde thus into the clowdes) is now come; being so earely vp by reason of Artificiall Lights, which wakened it, that the Sunne ouer-slept himselfe, and rose not in many houres after, yet bringing with it into the very bosome of the Cittie, a world of people. The Streets seemde to bee paued with men: Stalles in stead of rich wares were set out with children, open Casements fild vp with women. All Glasse windowes taken downe, but in their places, sparkeled so many eyes, that had it not bene the day, the light which reflected from them, was sufficient to haue made one: hee that should haue compared the emptie and vntroden walkes of London, which were to be seen in that late mortally-destroying Deluge, with the thronged streetes now, might haue belieued, that vpon this day, began a new Creation, &amp; that the Citie was the onely Workhouse wherein sundry Nations were made. A goodly and ciuil order was obserued, in Martialling all the Companies according to their degrees: The first beginning at the vpper end of Saint Marks Lane, and the last reaching aboue the Conduit in Fleetstreete: their Seats, being double-railde: vpon the vpper part wheron they leaned, the Streamers, Ensignes, and Bannerets, of each particular Company decently fixed: And directly against them, (euen quite through the body of the Citie, so hie as to Temple-Barre) a single Raile (in faire distance from the other) was likewise erected to put off the multitude. Amongst whose tongues (which in such Consorts neuer lye still,) tho there were no Musicke, yet as the Poet sayes: Mart. Vox diuersa sonat, populorum est vox tamen vna. Nothing that they speake could bee made any thing, yet all that was spoken, sounded to this purpose, that still his Maiestie was comming. They haue their longings: And behold, A farre off they spie him, richly mounted on a white Iennet, vnder a rich Canopy, sustained by eight Barons of the Cinqueports; the Tower seruing that morning but for his with-drawing Chamber, wherein hee made him ready: and from thence stept presently into his Citie of London, which for the time might worthily borrow the name of his Court Royall: His passage alongst that Court, offering it selfe for more State) through seuen Gates, of which the first was erected at Fanchurch. Thus presenting it selfe. It was an vpright Flat-square, (for it contained fiftie F?church. foote in the perpendiculer, and fiftie foote in the Ground-lyne) the vpper roofe thereof (one distinct Grices) bore vp the true moddells of all the notable Houses, Turrets, and Steeples, within the Citie. The Gate vnder which his Maiestie did passe, was 12. foote wide, and 18. foote hie: A Posterne likewise (at one side of it) being foure foote wide, and 8. foote in heigth: On either side of the Gate, stood a great French Terme, of stone, aduanced vpon wodden Pedestalls; two half Pilasters of Rustick, standing ouer their heads. I could shoote more Arrowes at this marke, and teach you without the Carpenters Rule how to measure all the proportions belonging to this Fabrick. But an excellent hand being at this instant curiously describing all the seuen, and bestowing on them their faire prospectiue limmes, your eye shall hereafter rather be delighted in beholding those Pictures, than now be wearied in looking vpon mine. The Personages (as well Mutes as Speakers) in this Pageant, were these: viz. 1 The highest Person was The Brittayne Monarchy. 2 At her feet, sate Diuine Wisdome. 3 Beneath her, stood The Genius of the City, A man. 4 At his right hand was placed a Personage, figuring, The Counsell of the City. 5 Vnder all these lay a person representing Thamesis the Riuer. Sixe other persons (being daughters to Genius) were aduaunced aboue him, on a spreading Ascent, of which the first was, 1 Gladnesse. 2 The second, Veneration. 3 The third, Promptitude. 4 The fourth, Vigilance. 5 The fift, Louing affection. 6 The sixth, Vnanimity. Of all which personages, Genius and Thamesis were the only Speakers: Thamesis being presented by one of the children of her Maiesties Reuels: Genius by M. Allin (seruant to the young Prince) his gratulatory speach (which was deliuered with excellent Action, and a well tun'de audible voyce) being to this effect: That London may be prowd to behold this day, and therefore in name of the Lord Maior and Aldermen, the Councell, Commoners and Multitude, the heartiest Welcome is tendered to his Maiesty, that euer was bestowed on any King, &amp;c. Which Banquet being taken away with sound The Wayts &amp; Hault-boyes of London. of Musicke, there, ready for the purpose, his Maiestie made his entrance into this his Court Royall: vnder this first Gate, vpon the Battlements of the worke, in great Capitalls was inscribed, thus: LONDINIVM. And vnder that, in a smaller (but not different) Caracter, was written, CAMERA REGIA: The Kings Chamber. Too short a time (in their opinions that were glewed there together so many houres, to behold him) did his Maiestie dwell vpon this first place: yet too long it seemed to other happy Spirits, that higher vp in these Elizian fields awaited for his presence: he sets on therefore (like the Sunne in his Zodiaque) bountifully dispersing his beames amongst particular Nations: the brightnesse and warmth of which, was now spent first vpon the Italians, &amp; next vpon the Belgians: The space of ground, on which their magnificent Arches were builded, being not vnworthy to beare the name of the great Hall to this our Court Royal: wherein was to be heard &amp; seene the sundry languages &amp; habits of Strangers, which vnder Princes Roofes render excellent harmony. In a paire of Scales doe I weigh these two Nations, and finde them (neither in hearty loue to his Maiestie, in aduancement of the Cities honor, nor in forwardnesse to glorifie these Triumphes) to differ one graine. To dispute which haue done best, were to doubt that one had done well. Call their inuentions therefore Twynnes: or if they themselues doe not like that name, (for happily they are emulous of one glory) yet thus may we speake of them. —Facies non omnibus vna, Nec diuersa tamen, Qualem decet esse sororum. Ouid. Because, whosoeuer (fixis oculis) beholds their proportions, Expleri mentem nequit, ardescit? tuendo. Virg. The street, vpon whose breast, this Italian Iewell Gracious street. was worne, was neuer worthy of that name which it carries, till this houre: For here did the Kings eye meete a second Obiect, that inticed him by tarrying to giue honor to the place. And thus did the queintnesse of the Engine seeme to discouer it selfe before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Italians Pageant. The building tooke vp the whole bredth of the Street, of which, the lower part was a Square, garnished with foure great Columnes: In the midst of which Square, was cut out a fayre and spacious high Gate, arched, being twenty seuen foot in the perpendicular lyne, and eyghteene at the ground lyne: ouer the Gate, in golden Caracters, these verses (in a long square) were inscribed: Tu Regere Imperio populos Iacobe memento, Hæ tibi erunt Artes, Paciq imponere morem, Parcere Subiectis, &amp; debellare superbos. And directly aboue this, was aduanc'd the Armes of the Kingdome, the Supporters fairely cut out to the life: ouer the Lyon (some prety distance from it) was written, IACOBO REGI MAGN. And aboue the head of the Vnicorne, at the like distance, this, HENRICI VII. ABNEP. In a large Square erected aboue all these, King Henry the seuenth was royally seated in his Imperiall Robes, to whome King Iames (mounted on horsebacke) approches, and receyues a Scepter, ouer both their heads these words being written, HIC VIR, HIC EST. Betweene two of the Columnes, (on the right hand) was fixed vp a Square table, wherein, in liuely and excellent colours, was lim'd a woman, figuring Peace, her head securely leaning on her left hand, her body modestly bestowed (to the length) vpon the earth: In her other hand, was held on Oliue branch, the Ensigne of Peace, her word was out of Virgil, being thus, —Deus nobis hæc otia fecit. Beneath that peece, was another square Table, reaching almost to the Bases of the two Columnes: In which, 2. (seeming) Sea personages, were drawne to the life, both of them lying, or rather leaning on the bosome of the earth, naked; the one a woman, her backe onely seene; the other a man, his hand stretching and fastning it selfe vpon her shoulder: the word that this dead body spake, was this, 1 Decus, 1 Nostrum. Vpon the left-hand side of the Gate, betweene the other two Columnes, were also two square Tables: In the one of which were two persons portrayed to the life, naked, and wilde in lookes, the word, Expectate solo Trinobanti. And ouer that, in another square, carying the same proportion, stoode a woman vpright, holding in her hand a Shield, beneath whom was inscribed in golden Caracters, —Spes ô fidissima rerum. And this was the shape and front of the first great Square, whose top being flat, was garnished with Pelasters, and vpon the roote was directed a great Padestall, on which stood a Person carued out to the life (a woman) her left hand leaning on a sword, with the poynt downeward, and her right hand reaching foorth a Diadem, which shee seemde by bowing of her knee and head, to bestow vpon his Maiestie. On the foure corners of this vpper part, stoode foure naked portraytures (in great) with artificiall Trumpets in their hands. In the Arch of the Gate, was drawne (at one side) a companie of Palme trees, young, and as it were but newly springing, ouer whose branches, two naked winged Angels, flying, held foorth a Scroll, which seem'd to speake thus, Spes altera. On the contrarie side, was a Vine, spreading it selfe into many branches, and winding about Oliue, and Palme trees: two naked winged Angels hanging likewise in the Ayre ouer them, and holding a Scrol betweene them, fild with this inscription, Vxortus, sicut vitis abundans, Et filii tui, sicut palmites Oliuarum. If your imaginations (after the beholding of these obiects) will suppose, that his Maiestie is now gone to the other side of this Italian Trophee; doe but cast your eyes backe, and there you shall finde iust the same proportions, which the fore-part, or Brest of our Arch carrieth, with equall number of Columnes, Pedestals, Pilasters, Lim'd peeces, and Carued Statues. Ouer the Gate, this Distichon presents it selfe. Nonne tuo Imperio satis est Iacobe potiri? Imperium in Musas, Aemule quaris? Habes. Vnder which verses, a wreathe of Lawrell seem'd to be ready to be let fall on his Maiesties head, as hee went vnder it, being held betweene two naked Antique women, their bodies stretching (at the full length) to compasse ouer the Arch of the Gate. And aboue those verses, in a faire Azure table, this inscription was aduanc'd in golden Capitals: EXPECTATIONI ORBIS TERRARVM, REGIB. GENITO NVMEROSISS. REGVM GENITORI FAELICISS. REGI MARTIGENARVM AVGVSTISS. REGI MVSARVM GLORIOSISS. Itali statuerunt lætitiæ &amp; cultus Signum. On the right hand of this backe-part, betweene two of the Columnes was a square table, in which was drawne a Woman, crown'd with beautifull and fresh flowres, a Caducæus in her hand: All the notes of a plenteous and liuely Spring being caried about her, the soule that gaue life to this speaking picture, was: —Omnis feret omnia Tellus. Aboue this peece, in another square, was portrayed a Tryton, his Trumpet at his mouth, seeming to vtter thus much, Dum Cælum stellas. Vpon the left hand of this back-part, in most excellent colours, Antikely attir'd, stood the 4. kingdoms, England, Scotland, France and Ireland, holding hands together, this being the language of them all, Concordes stabili Fatorum Numine. The middle great Square, that was aduaunced ouer the Freeze of the Gate, held Apollo, with all his Ensignes and properties belonging vnto him, as a Sphere, Bookes, a Caducæus, an Octoedron, with other Geometricall Bodies, and a Harpe in his left hand: his right hand with a golden Wand in it, poynting to the battel of Lepanto fought by the Turks, (of which his Maiestie hath written a Poem) and to doe him Honour, Apollo himselfe doth here seeme to take vpon him to describe: his word, Fortunate Puer. These were the Mutes, and properties that helpt to furnish out this great Italian Theater: vpon whose Stage, the sound of no voice was appointed to be heard, but of one, (and that, in the presence of the Italians themselues) who in two little opposite galleries vnder &amp; within the Arch of the gate, very richly and neately hung, deliuered thus much Latine to his Maiestie: The Italians speach. Salue, Rex magne, salue. Salutem Maiestati tuæ Itali fælicissimum Aduentum læti, fælices sub Te futuri, precamur. Ecce hic Omnes, Exigui munere, pauculi Numero: Sed magni erga Maiestatem tuam animi, multi obsequij. At nec Atlas, qui Cœlum sustinet, nec ipsa Cœli conuexa, altitudinem attingant meritorum Regis optimi. Hoc est, eius, quem de Teipso expressisti doctissimo (Deus!) et admirabili penicillo: Beatissimos populos, vbi &amp; Philosophus regnat, &amp; Rex Philosophatur, Salue, Rex nobilissime, salue, viue, Rex potentissime, fæliciter. Regna, Rex sapientissime, fæliciter, Itali optamus omnes, Itali clamamus omnes: Omnes, omnes. Hauing hoysted vp our Sailes, and taken leaue of this Italian shore, let our next place of casting anker, be vpon the Land of the 17. Prouinces; where the Belgians, (attired in the costly habits of their own natiue Countrey, without the fantasticke mixtures of other Nations) but more richly furnished with loue, stand ready to receyue his Maiestie: who (according to their expectation) does most gratiously make himselfe &amp; his Royall traine their Princely ghests. The house which these Strangers haue builded to entertaine him in, is thus contriu'de.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Pageant of the Dutch-men, by the Royal Exchange. The Foundation of this, was (as it were by Fate) layd neere vnto a royall place; for it was a royall and magnificent labour: It was bounded in with the houses on both sides the street, so prowdly (as all the rest also did) did this extend her body in bredth. The passage of State, was a Gate, large, asc?ding eighteene foot high, aptly proportion'd to the other lymmes, and twelue foot wyde, arched; two lesser Posternes were for common feet, cut out and open'd on the sides of the other. Within a small Freeze, (and kissing the very forhead of the Gate) the Aedifice spake thus, Vnicus à Fato surgo non Degener Hæres.

Aboue which (being the heart of the Trophee) was a spacious square roome, left open, Silke Curtaines drawne before it, which (vpon the approch of his Maiestie) being put by, 17. yong Damsels, (all of them sumptuously adorned, after their countrey fashion,) sate as it were in so many Chaires of State, and figuring in their persons, the 17. Prouinces of Belgia, of which euery one caried in a Scutchion (excellently pencilde the Armes and Coate of one. Aboue the vpper edge of this large Square Roome, and ouer the first Battlement, in another front, aduanc'd for the purpose, a square Table was fastened vpright, in which was drawne the liuely picture of the King, in his Imperial Robes; a Crowne on his head, the Sword and Scepter in his handes: vpon his left side stood a woman, her face fixed vpon his, a burning hart in her right hand, her left hanging by, a Heron standing close vnto her: vpon his other side stood vpright (with her countenance directed likewise vpon him) another woman, winged, and in a Freeze beneath them, which tooke vp the full length of this Square: this inscription set out it selfe in golden wordes: —Vtroque Satellite Tutus. Suffer your eyes to be wearied no longer with gazing vp so high at those Sun-beams, but turne th? aside to looke below through the little Posternes: whose State sweld quickly vp to a greatnes, by reason of 2. Columnes, that supported them on either side. In a Table, ouer the right-hand Portall, was in perfect colours, drawne a Serp?t, pursude by a Lion: betweene them, Adders and Snakes, chasing one another, the Lion scornfully casting his head backe, to behold the violence of a blacke storme, that heauen powred downe, to ouertake them: the sound that came from all this, was thus: —Sequitur grauis Ira feroces. The opposite body to this son the other side, and directly ouer the other Portall, whose pompe did in like maner leane vpon, and vphold it selfe by two mayne Columnes) was a square peece, in which were to be seene, Sheepe browzing, Lambes nibbling, Byrds flying in the Ayre, with other arguments of a serene and vntroubled season, whose happinesse was proclaymed in this maner, —Venit alma Cicuribus Aura. Directly aboue this, in a square Table, were portrayed two Kings, reuerently and antiquely attyrde, who seem'd to walke vpon these golden lines, Nascitur in nostro Regum par Nobile Rege Alter Iesiades, Alter Amoniades. From whome, leade but your eye, in a straight line, to the other side, (ouer the contrary Posteme) and there in a second vpper Picture, you may meete with two other Kings, not fully so antique, but as rich in their Ornaments; both of them, out of golden letters, composing these wordes. Lucius ante alios, Edwardus, &amp; inde IACOBVS Sextus, &amp; hic sanxit, sextus &amp; ille fidem. And these were the Nerues, by which this great Triumphall Body was knit together, in the inferiour parts of it, vpon the shoulders whereof, (which were garnished with rowes of Pilasters, that supported Lions r?pant, bearing vp Banners) there stood another lesser Square, the head of which wore a Coronet of Pilasters also; and aboue th? vpon a Pedestal, curiously closed in betweene the tayles of two Dolphins, was aduanced a Woman, holding in one hand, a golden Warder, and poynting with the fore-finger of the other hand vp to heauen. She figur'd Diuine Prouidence, for so at her feete was written. Prouida Mens Cœli. Somewhat beneath which, was to bee seene an Imperiall Crowne, two Scepters being fastened (crosse-wise) vnto it, and deliuering this speach, —Sceptra hæc coneredidit vni. At the elbowes of this vpper Square, stood vpon the foure corners of a great Pedestall, foure Pyramides, hollow, and so neately contriu'de, that in the night time (for anger that the Sunne would no longer looke vpon these earthly beauties) they gaue light to themselues, and the whole place about them: the windowes, from whence these artificiall beames were throwne, being cut out in such a fashion, that (as Ouid, describing the Palace of the Sunne, sayes) Clara micante Auro, Flammasq; imitante Pyropo, So did they shine afarre off, like Crysolites, and sparkled like Carbuncles: Betweene those two Pyramides that were lifted vp on the right hand, stood Fortitude; her Piller resting it selfe vpon this golden line, Perfero curarum pondus, Discrimina temno. Betweene the two Pyramides on the other side, Iustice challenged her place, being knowne both by her habit and by her voyce, that spake thus, Auspice me Dextra solium Regale perennat. Wee haue held his Maiestie too long from entring this third Gate of his Court Royall; It is now hie time, that those eyes, which on the other side ake with rolling vp and downe for his gladsome presence, should inioy that happinesse. Beholde, hee is in an instance passed thorough; The Obiects that there offer themselues before him, being these: Our Belgick Statue of Triumph, weares on her backe, as much riches, as she caried vpon her brest, being altogether as glorious in Columnes, standing on Tip-toe, on as loftie and as proude Pyramides; her walkes encompa'st with as strong and as neate Pilasters: the colours of her garments are as bright, her adornements as many: For, In the square Field, next and lower, ouer one of the Portals, were the Dutch Countrey people, toyling at their Husbandrie; women carding of their Hemp, the men beating it, such excellent Art being exprest in their faces, their stoopings, bendings, sweatings, &amp;c. that nothing is wanting in them but life (which no colours can giue) to make them bee thought more than the workes of Paynters. Lift vp your eyes a little aboue them, and beholde their Exchange; the countenaunces of the Marchants there being so liuely, that bargaines seeme to come from their lippes. But in stead of other speach, this is onely to bee had, PIO INVICTO, R. IACOBO, QVOD FEL. EIVS AVSPICIIS VNIVERSVM BRIT. IMPERIVM PACAT, MARE TVTVM PORTVS APERIT. Ouer the other Portall, in a square (proportion'd, to the bignes of those other) men, women &amp; childr? (in Dutch habits) are busie at other workes: the men Weauing, the women Spinning, the children at their Hand-loomes, &amp;c. Aboue whose heads, you may with little labour, walke into the Mart, where as well the Eroe, as the Burger, are buying and selling, the praise of whose industrie (being worthy of it) stands publisht in gold, thus, QVOD MVTVIS COMMERCIIS, ET ARTIFICVM, NAVTARVMQVE, SOLERTIA CRESCAT, DESIDIA EXVLAT, MVTVAQVE AMICITIA CONSERVETVR. Iust in the midst of these foure Squares, and directly ouer the Gate, in a large Table, whose feete are fastned to the Freeze, is their fishing &amp; shipping liuely and sweetely set downe: The Skipper (euen though he be hard tugging at his Net) loudly singing this: Quod Celeb: hoc Emporium prudenti industria suos, Quouis Terrarum Negotiatores emittat, exteros Humaniter admittat, foris famam, domi diuitias augeat. Let vs now clime vp to the vpper battlementes; where, at the right hand Time standes: at the left (in a direct line) his daughter Trueth; vnder her foote is written, Sincera. And vnder his, Durant. Sincera Durant. In the midst of these two, three other persons are rancked togeather, Art, Sedulitie, and Labour: beneath whom, in a Freeze rouing along the whole breadth of that Square, you may find these wordes in gold. Artes, Perfecit, Sedulitate, Labor. As on the foreside, so on this, and equall in heigth to that of Diuine Prouidence, is the figure of a Woman aduaunced: beneath whom, is an imperiall Crowne, with branches of Oliue, fixed (crosse-wise) vnto it, and giues you this word. Sine Cæde at Sanguine. And thus haue we bestowed vpon you, all the dead Cullours of this Picture, (wherein not withstanding, was left so much life) as can come from Art.

Whilst the tongues of the Strangers were imployed in extolling the gracious Aspect of the King, and his Princely behauiour towardes them, his Maiestie (by the quicknes of Time, and the earnestnesse of expectation, whose eyes ran a thousand wayes to finde him) had won more ground, and was gotten so far as to S. Mildreds Church in the Poulterie: close to the side of which, a Scaffold was erected; where (at the Citties cost) to delight the Queene with her owne country Musicke, nine Trumpets, and a Kettle Drum, did very sprightly &amp; actiuely sound the Danish march: Whose cunning and quicke stops, by that time they had toucht the last Ladyes care in the traine, behold, the King was aduaunced vp so hie as to Cheapeside: into which place (if Loue himselfe had entered, and seene so many gallant Gentlemen, so many Ladyes, and beautifull creatures, in whose eyes glaunces (mixt with modest lookes) seemde to daunce courtly Measures in their motion) he could not haue chosen, to haue giuen the Roome any other name, then, The Presence Chamber.

Two Posternes stoode wide open on the two sides, either of them being 4. foote wide, and 8. foote high. The two Portals that ietted out before these Posternes, had their sides open foure seuerall wayes, and serued as Pedestalles (of Rusticke) to support two Pyramides, which stoode vpon foure great Balles, and foure great Lions: the Pedestalles, Balles, and Pyramides, deuowring in their full vpright height, from the ground line to the top, iust 60. foote. But burying this Mechanicke Body in scilence, let vs now take note in what fashion it stood attyred. Thus then it went appareled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Deuice at Soper-lane end. VVithin a large Compartiment, mounted aboue the forehead of the Gate, ouer the Freeze, in Capitalles was inscribed this Title: NOVA FÆLIX ARABIA. Vnder that shape of Arabia, this Iland being figured; which two names of New, and Happie, the Countrey could by no merit in it selfe, challenge to be her due, but onely by meanes of that secret influence accompanying his Maiestie wheresoeuer hee goes, and working such effectes. The most worthy personage aduaunced in this place, was Arabia Britannica, a Woman, attyred all in White, a rich Mantle of Greene cast about her, an imperiall Crowne on her head, and a Scepter in one hand, a Mound in the other; vpon which she sadly leaned: a rich Veyle (vnder the Crowne) shadowing her eyes, by reason that her countenaunce (which till his Maiesties approach, could by no worldly obiect be drawne to looke vp) was pensiuely deiected: her ornamentes were markes of Chastetie and Youth: the Crowne, Mound, and Scepter, badges of Soueraigntie. Directly vnder her in a Cant by her selfe, Fame stood vpright: A Woman in a Watchet Roabe, thickly set with open Eyes, and Tongues, a payre of large golden Winges at her backe, a Trumpet in her hand, a Mantle of sundry cullours trauersing her body: all these Ensignes desplaying but the propertie of her swiftnesse, and aptnesse to disperse Rumors. In a Descent beneath her, being a spatious Concaue roome, were exalted fiue Mounts, swelling vp with different ascensions: vpon which sate the fiue Sences, drooping: Viz. 1 Auditus, Hearing. 2 Visus, Sight. 3 Tactus, Feeling. 4 Olfactus. Smelling 5 Gustus, Taste. Appareled in Roabes of distinct cullours, proper to their natures; and holding Scutchions in their handes: vpon which were drawne Herogliphicall bodyes, to expresse their qualities. Some prettie distaunce from them (and as it were in the midst before them) an artificiall Lauer or Fount was erected, called the Fount of Arate (Vertue.) Sundry Pipes (like veines) branching from the body of it: the water receiuing libertie but from one place, and that very slowly. At the foote of this Fount, two personages (in greater shapes then the rest) lay sleeping: vpon their brestes stucke their names, Detractio, Obliuio: The one holdes an open Cuppe; about whose brim, a wreath of curled Snakes were winding, intimating that whatsoeuer his lippes toucht, was poysoned: the other helde a blacke-Cuppe couerd, in token of an enuious desire to drowne the worth and memorie of Noble persons. Vpon an Ascent, on the right hand of these, stood the three Charites or Graces, hand in hand, attyred like three Sisters. Aglaia, Figuring Brightnesse, or Maiestie. Thalia, Figuring Youthfulnes, or florishing. Euphrosine, Figuring Chearfulnes, or gladnes. They were all three Virgins: their countenaunces laboring to smother an innated sweetnes and chearefulnes, that appareled their cheekes; yet hardly to be hid: their Garmentes were long Roabes of sundry coloures, hanging loose: the one had a Chapler of sundry Flowers on her head, clustard heere and there with the Fruites of the earth. The seconde, a Garland of eares of Corne. The third, a wreath of Vinebranches, mixt with Grapes and Oliues. Their haire hung downe ouer their shoulders loose, and of a bright cullour, for that Epithite is properly bestowed vpon them, by Homer in his Himne to Apollo. PVLCHRICOMÆ CHARITES. The Bright Hayrde Graces. They helde in their handes pensild Shieldes: vpon the first, was drawne a Rose: on the second, 3. Dyce: on the third, a branch of Mirtle. Figuring Pleasantnesse, Accord, Florishing. In a direct line against them, stoode the three Howres, to whom in this place we giue the names of Loue, Iustice, and Peace: they were attyred in loose Roabes of light cullours, paynted with Flowers: for so Ouid apparrels them. Conveniunt pictis incinctæ vestibus Horæ. Winges at their feete, expressing their swiftnesse, because they are Lackies to the Sunne: Iungere eques Tytan velocibus imperat Horis. Ouid. Each of them helde two Goblets; the one full of Flowers (as Ensigne of the Spring,) the other full of rypened Figges, the Cognisance of Summer. Vpon the approch of his Maiestie (sad and solemne Musicke hauing beaten the Ayre all the time of his absence, and now ceasing,) Fame speakes. Fama. Turne into Ice mine eye-balls, whilst the sound Flying through this brazen trump, may back rebound To stop Fames hundred tongues, leauing them mute, As in an vntoucht Bell, or stringlesse Lute, For Vertues Fount, which late ran deepe and cleare, Drie, and melts all her body to a teare. You Graces! and you houres that each day runne On the quicke errands of the golden Sunne, O say! to Vertues Fount what has befell, That thus her veines shrinke vp. Charites Horæ. Wee cannot tell.

Behold the fiue-folde guard of Sence which keepes The sacred streame, sit drooping: neere them sleepe Two horred Monsters: Fame! summon each Sence, To tell the cause of this strange accidence. Heere upon Fame sounding her Trumpet; Arabia Britannica, lookes cheerefully vp, the sences are startled: Detraction and Obliuion throw off their iron slumber, busily bestowing all their powers to fill their cups at the Fount with their olde malitious intention to sucke it drie; But a strange and heauenly musicke suddainly striking through their eares, which causing a wildnes and quicke motion in their lookes, drew them to light vpon the glorious presence of the King, they were suddainly thereby daunted and sunke downe; The Fount in the same moment of Tyme, flowing fresh and aboundantly through seuerall pipes, with Milke, Wine, and Balme, whilst a person (figuring Circumspection) that had watcht day and night, to giue note to the world of this blessed Tyme, which hee foresawe would happen, steps forth on a mounted Stage extended 30. foote in length from the maine building, to deliuer to his Maiestie the interpretation of this dumbe Mysterie. This Presenter was a Boy, one of the Choristers, belonging to Paules. His Speech. Great Monarch of the West, whose glorious Stem, Doth now support a triple Diadem, Weying more th? that of thy grand Grandsire Brute, Thou that maist make a King thy substitute, And doest besides the Red-rose and the white, With the rich flower of France thy garland dight, Wearing aboue Kings now, or those of olde, A double Crowne of Lawrell and of gold, O let my voyce passe through thy royall eare, And whisper thus much, that we figure here, A new Arabia, in whose spiced nest A Phœnix siu'd and died in the Sunnes brest, Her losse, made sight, in teares to drowne her eyes, The Eare grew deafe, Tastelike a sick-man lyes, Finding no rellish: euery other Sence, Forgat his office, worth and excellence, Whereby this Fount of Vertue gan to freeze, Threatned to be drunke by two enemies, Snakie Detraction, and Obliuion, But at thy glorious presence, both are gone, Thou being that sacred Phœnix, that doest rise, From th'ashes of the first: Beames from thine eyes So vertually shining, that they bring, To Englands new Arabia, a new Spring: For ioy whereof, Nimphes, Sences, Houres, &amp; Fame, Eccho loud Hymnes to his imperiall name. At the shutting vp of this Speech, his Maiestie (being readie to goe on,) did most graciouslie feede the eyes of beholders with his presence, till a Song was spent: which to a loude and excellent Musicke (composed of Violins &amp; an other rare Artificiall Instrum?t, wherein besides sundrie seuerall sounds effus'd (all at one time) were also sensibly distinguisht the chirpings of birds, was by two Boyes (Choristers of Paules) deliuered in sweete and rauishing voyces. [Boyes.] Cant. [1] Troynouant is now no more a Citie: O great pittie! is't not pittie? And yet her Towers on tiptoe stand, Like Pageants built on Fairie land, And her Marblearmes, Like to Magicke charmes, binde thousands fast vnto her, That for her wealth &amp; beauty daily wooeher, yet for all this, is't not pittie? Troynouant is now no more a Cittie. 2 Troynouant is now a Sommer Arbour, or the nest wherein doth harbour, The Eagle, of all birds that flie, The Soueraigne, for his piercing eie, If you wisely marke, Tis besides a Parke, Where runnes (being newly borne) With the fierce Lyon, the faire Vnicorne, or else it is a wedding Hall, Where foure great Kingdomes holde a Festiuall. 3 Troynouant is now a Bridall Chamber, whose roofe is gold, floore is of Amber, By vertue of that holy light, That burnes in Hymens hand, more bright, Than the siluer Moone, or the Torch of Noone, Harke what the Ecchoes say! Brittaine till now nere kept a Holiday: for Ioue dwels heere: And tis no pittie, If Troynouant be now no more a Cittie. Nor let the scrue of any wresting comment vpon these words, Troynouant is now no more a Citie. Enforce the Authors inuention away fr? his owne cleare straight and harmelesse meaning: all the scope of this fiction stretching onely to this point, that London (to doo honour to this day, wherein springs vp all her happines) beeing rauished with vnutterable ioyes, makes no account (for the present) of her ancient title, to be called a Citie; (because that during these tryumphes, shee puts off her formall habite of Trade and Commerce, treading euen Thrift it selfe vnder foote, but now becomes a Reueller and a Courtier. So that, albeit in the end of the first Stanza tis said, through the Citie of London. Yet for all this, is't not pittie, Troynouant is now no more a Cittie. By a figure called Castigatio or the mender, heere followes presently a reproofe; wherein tytles of Sommer Arbor; The Eagles nest, a wedding H?ll, &amp;c. are throwne vpon her, the least of them being at this time by vertue of Poeticall Heraldrie, but especiallie in regard of the State that now vpholds her, thought to be names of more honour, than that of her owne. And this short Apologie, doth our verse make for it selfe, in regard that some, (to whose setled iudgement and authoritie the censure of these Deuises was referred,) brought though not bitterly the life of those lines into question: But appealing with Mæchætas to Phillip, now these reasons haue awakend him: let vs followe King Iames, who hauing passed vnder this our third gate, is by this time, graciously receauing a gratulatorie Oration from the mouth of Sir Henry Mountague, Recorder of the Citie, a square lowe gallorie, set round about with pilasters, beeing for that purpose erected some 4. foote from the ground, and ioyned to the front of the Crosse in Cheape; where likewise stood all the Aldermen, the Chamberlaine, Towne-clarke, and Counsell of the Citie. The Recorders Speech. High Imperiall Maiestie, it is not yet a yeere in dayes since with acclamation of the People, Citizens, and Nobles, auspitiouslie heere at this Crosse was proclaimed your true succession to the Crowne. If then it was ioyous with Hats, hands, and hearts, lift vp to heauen to crie King Iames, what is it now to see King Iames? Come therefore O worthiest of Kings as a glorious Bridegroome through your Royall chamber: But to come neerer, Adest quem querimus. Twentie and more are the Soueraignes wee haue serued since our conquest, but Conquerour of hearts it is you and your Posteritie, that we haue vowed to loue and wish to serue whilst London is a Citie. In pledge whereof my Lord Maior, the Aldermen, and Commons of this Citie, wishing a golden Reigne vnto you, present your Greatnes with a little cup of gold. At the end of the Oration three Cups of gold were giuen (in the name of the Lord Maior, and the whole Body of the Citie,) to his Maiestie, the young Prince, and the Queene. All which but aboue all (being gifts of greater value) the loyall hearts of the Citizens, beeing louingly receaued; his Grace was (at least it was appointed he should haue beene) met on his way neere to the Crosse, by Syluanus drest vp in greene Iuie, a Cornet in his hand, being attended on by foure other Syluans in Iuie likewise, their bowes and quiuers hanging on their shoulders, and winde Instruments in their hands. Vpon sight of his Maiestie, they make a stand, Syluanus breaking forth into this abrupt passion of ioy. Syluanus. Stay Syluans, and let the loudest voyce of Musicke proclayme it (euen as high as Heauen) that hee is come. Alter Apollo redit, Nouus En, iam regnat Apollo. Which acclamation of his was borne vp into the ayre, and there mingled with the breath of their musicall Instruments: whose sound beeing vanish?d to nothing, Thus goes our Speaker on. Syluanus. Most happie Prince, pardon me, that being meane in habite, and wilde in apparance, (for my richest liuorie is but leaues, and my stateliest dwelling but in the woodes,) thus rudely with piping Syluanes. I presume to intercept your royall passage. These are my walkes: yet stand I heere, not to cut off your way, but to giue it a full and a bounteous welcome, beeing a Messenger sent from the Lady Eirene my Mistresse, to deliuer an errand to the best of all these Worthies, your royall selfe. Many Kingdomes hath the Lady sought out to abide in, but from them all, hath shee beene most churlishly banished: not that her beautie did deserue such vnkindnes, but that (like the eye of Heauen) hers were too bright, and there were no Eagles breeding in those nests, that could truly beholde them. At last heere she ariued, Destinie subscribing to this Warrant, that none but this Land should be her Inheritance. In contempt of which happines, Enuie shootes his impoisoned stings at her heart, but his Adders (being charmed) turne their daungerous heads vpon his owne bosome. Those that dwell far off, pine away with vexing to see her prosper, because all the acquaintauce which they haue of her, is this, that they know there is such a goodly Creature as Eirene, in the world, yet her face they know not: whilst all those that heere sleepe vnder the warmth of her wings, adore her by the sacred &amp; Cœlestiall name of Peace, for number being (as her blessings are) infinite. Her daughter Euporia (well knowne by the name of Plentie, is at this present with her, (being indeede neuer from her side) vnder yonder Arbour they sit, which after the daughters name is called, Hortus Euporiæ (Plenties Bower:) Chast are they both, and both maydens in memorie of a Virgine, to whom they were nurse children: for whose sake (because they were bound to her for their life,) mee, haue they charged to lay at your imperiall feete, (being your hereditarie due) the tribute of their loue: And with it thus to say. That they haue languished many heauie moneths for your presence, which to them would haue beene, (&amp; proud they are that it shall be so now,) of the same operation and influence, that the Sunne is to the spring, and the spring to the earth: hearing therefore what trebble preferment you haue bestowed vpon this day, wherein besides the beames of a glorious Sunne, two other cleare and gracious starres shine cheerefullie on these her homely buildings: Into which (because no dutie should bee wanting) shee hath giuen leaue euen to Strangers, to bee Sharers in her happines, by suffering them to bid you likewise welcome. By mee (once hers now your vassaile,) shee entreates, and with a knee sinking lower than the ground on which you tread, doo I humbly execute her pleasure, that ere you passe further, you would deigne to walke into yonder Garden: the Hesperides liue not there but the Muses, and the Muses no longer than vnder your protection. Thus farre am I sent to conduct you thither, prostrately begging this grace, (since I dare not, as beeing vnwoorthie, lackey by your royall side) in that yet these my greene Followers and my selfe may bee ioyfull fore-runners of your expected approch, away Syluanus. And being (in this their returne) come neare to the Arbor, they gaue a signe with a short florish from all their Cornets, that his Maiestie was at hand: whose princely eye whilest it was delighting it selfe with the quaint obiect before it, a sweete pleasure likewise courted his eare in the shape of Musicke, sent from the voyces of nine Boyes (all of them Queristers of Paules) who in that place presenting the nine Muses sang the dittie following to their Viols and other Instruments. But, least leaping too bluntly into the midst of our Garden at first, we deface the beautie of it, let vs send you round about it, and suruey the Walles, Allies, and quarters of it as they lye in order. This being the fashion of it. The passages through it were two gates, arched and grated Arbor-wise, their heigth being 16. foote, their breadth 10. from the roofe, and so on the sides, downe to the ground, Cowcumbers, Pompions, Grapes, and all other fruits growing in the land, hanging artificially in clusters: Betweene the two gates, a payre of stayres were mounted with some 20 assents: at the bottome of them (on two pillers) were fixed two Satiers canied out in wood; the sides of both the gates, being strengthened with foure great French frames standing vpon pedestals, taking vp in their full height 20. foote. The vpper part also caried the proportion, of an Arbor, being closde with their round tops, the midst whereof was exalted aboue the other two, Fortune standing on the top of it. The garnishments for the whole Bower, being Apples, Peares, Cheries, Grapes, Roses, Lillies, and all other both fruits and flowers most artificially molded to the life. The whole frame of this somer banqueting house, stood (at the ground line) vpon 4 foote; the Perpendicular stretching itselfe to 45. Wee might (that day) haue called it, The Musicke roome, by reason of the chaunge of tunes, that danced round about it; for in one place were heard a noyse of cornets, in a second, a consort, the third, (which sate in sight) a set of Viols, to which the Muses sang. The principall persons aduanede in this Bower, were, Eirene (Peace) and Euporia (Plenty) who sate together. Eierene. Peace: Was richly attired, her vpper garment of carnation, hanging loose, a Robe of White vnder it, powdred with Starres, and girt to her: her haire of a bright colour, long, and hanging at her back, but interwouen with white ribbands, and Iewels: her browes were encompast with a wreath compounded of the Oliue, the Lawrell, &amp; the Date tree: In one hand shee held a Caducæns, (or Mercuries rod, the god of eloquence:) In the other, ripe eares of come gilded: on her lap sate a Doue: All these being ensignes, and furnitures of Peace. Euporie. Plenty: Her daughter sate of the left hand, in changable colours, a rich mantle of Gold trauersing her bodie: her haire large and loosely spreading ouer her shoulders: on her head a crowne of Poppy &amp; Mustard seede; the antique badges of Fertilitie &amp; Abundance, In her right hand a Cornucopia, filde with flowers, fruits, &amp;c. Chrusos. Directly vnder these, sate Chrusos, a person figuring Gold, his dressing, a tinsell Robe of the colour of Gold. Argurion. And close by him, Argurion, Siluer, all in white tinfell; both of them crownde, and both their hands supporting a Globe, betweene them, in token that they commaunded ouer the world. Pomona. Pomona, the goddesse of garden fruits; sate at the one side of Gold and Siluer; attirde in greene, a wreath of frutages circling her temples: her armes naked: her haire beautifull, and long. Ceres. On the other side sate Ceres, crowned with ripened eares of Wheate, in a loose straw-coloured roabe. In two large descents (a little belowe them) were placde at one end, The nine Muses. With musicall instruments in their hands, to which they sung all the day. Clio. Euterpe. Thalia. Melpomene. Terpsicore. Erato. Polymnia. Vranio. Calliope. At the other end. The 7 liberall Artes. Holding shieldes in their hands, expressing their seuerall offices. Grammer. Logique. Rhetorique. Musicke. Arithmeticke. Geometry. Astrology. Vpon the verie vpper edge of a faire large Freeze, running quite along the full breadth of the Arbor, and iust a their feete were planted rankes of artificiall Artichocks and roses. To describe what apparrell these Arts, and Muses wore, were a hard labour, and when it were done, all were but idle. Few Taylors know how to cut out their garments: they haue no Wardrob at all, not a Mercer, nor Merchant, though they can all write and read verie excellently well, will suffer them to bee great in their bookes. But (as in other countries) so in this of ours, they goe attirde in such thin clothes, that the winde euerie minute is readie to blowe through them: happy was it for them, that they tooke vp their lodging in a summer arbour, and that they had so much musicke to comfort them, their ioies (of which they do not euerie daie tast,) being notwithstanding now infinitelie multiplied, in this, that where before they might haue cryed out till they grew horse, &amp; non would heare th?, now they sing. Aderitque vocatus Apollo. Chorus in full voices answering it thus. Ergo alacris Syluas, &amp; cætera rura a voluptas Panaque pastoresque tenet, Driadasque puellas, Nec Lupus insidias pecori, nec retia Ceruis Vlla dolum meditantur, amat bonus otia Daphnis; Ipsi lætitia voces ad sidera iactant Intonsi montes: ipsæ iam carmina Rupes, Ipsa sonant Arbusta, Deus, Deus ille! Syluanus (as you may perceiue by his office before) was but sent of an errand: there was another of a higher calling, a Trauailer, and one that had gon ouer much grownd, appointed to speake to his Maiesty, his name Vertumnus, the maister Gardner, and husband to Pomona: To tell you what cloathes hee had on his backe were to doo him wrong, for hee had (to say truth) but one suite: homelie it was, yet meete and fit for a Gardener: In steade of a hat, his browes were bound about with flowers, out of whose thicke heapes, here and there peeped a queene apple, a cherie, or a peare, this boon-grace hee made of purpose to keepe his face from heate, (because he desired to looke louelie) yet the sunne found him out, and by casting a continuall eye at him, whilst the old man was dressing his arbours, his cheekes grew tawnie, which colour for the better grace, he himselfe interpreted blushing. A white head he had, &amp; sunne-burnt hands: in the one he held a weeding hooke, in the other a grafting knife: and this was the tenor of his speech. That he was bound to giue thanks to heau?, In that the arbour and trees which growing in that fruitfull Cynthian garden, began to droop and hang downe their greene heades, and to vncurle their crisped forlocks, as fearing and in some sort, feeling the sharpenesse of Autumnian malice, are now on the sudden by the deuine influence apparelled with a fresh and more liuely verdure than euer they were before. The nine Muses that could expect no better entertainement than sad banishment, hauing now louely and amiable faces: Arts that were threatned to be trod vnder foot by Barbarisme, now (euen at sight of his Maiestie who is the Delian Patr? both of the Muses &amp; Arts) being likewise aduanced to most high preferm?t whilst the very rurall &amp; Syluane troopes dancd for ioy: the Lady therfore of the place Eirene, (his mistris) in name of the Prætor, Consuls &amp; Senators of the City, who carefully pruine this garden, (weeding out al hurtful &amp; idle branches that hinder the growth of the good,) and who are indeede, Ergatai Pistoi, faithfull Laborers in this peice of ground, Shee doth in al their names, (&amp; he in behalfe of his Lady) offer them selues, this Arbor, the bowers &amp; walkes, yea her children gold &amp; siluer, with the louing &amp; loyall harts of all those the Sons of peace, standing about him, to be disposde after his royal pleasure. And so wishing his happie Arriual, at a more glorious bower, to which he is now going, yet welcoming him to this, &amp; praying his Maiesty not to forget this poore Arbor of his Lady, Musicke is commanded to cary all their praiers for his happie reigne, with the loud Amen of all his Subiects as hie as heauen. Cant. [1] Shine Titan shine. Let thy sharpe raies be hurld Not on this vnder world, For now tis none of thine. These first 4. lines were sung by one alone, the single lines following, by a Chorus in full voices. Chor. No, no tis none of thine. 2 But in that spheare, Where what thine armes infolde, Turnes all to burnisht gold, Spend thy guilt arrowes there, Chor. Doe, doe, shoote onelie there. 3 Earth needes thee not: Her childbed daies are done, And Shee another Sunne, Faire as thy selfe has got. Chor. A new new Sunne is got. 4 O this is He! Whose new beames make our Spring, Men glad and birdes to Sing, Hymnes of praise, ioy, and glee. Sing, Sing, O this is hee! 5 That in the North First rizing: shonne (so far) Bright as the morning Starre, At his gaie comming forth. Chor. See, see, he now comes forth. 6 How soone ioies varie? Here staide hee still! O then Happie both place and men, But here hee list not tarrie. Chor. O griefe! had list not tarrie. 7 No, no, his beames, Must equall deuide, Their heate to Orbes beside, Like nourishing siluer streames. Chor. Ioies slide awaie like streames. 8 Yet in this lies Sweete hope: how far soeuer, Hee bides, no cloudes can seuer, His glorie from our eyes. Chor. Drie, drie, your weeping eies. 9 And make heauen ring, His welcomes showted loudelie, For Heauen it selfe lookes proudly, That earth has such a King. Chor. Earth has not such a King. His Maiestie dwelt here a reasonable long time, giuing both good allowance to the song &amp; Musick, and liberally bestowing his eye on the workemanship of the place: from whence at the length departing, his next entrance was, as it were, into the closet or rather the priuy chamber to this our Court royall: through the windowes of which he might behold the Cathedrall Temple of Saint Paule: vpon whose lower batlements an Antheme was sung, by the Quiristers of the Church to the musicke of loud instrum?ts: which being finisht, a latine Orati? was Viua voce deliuered to his grace, by one of maister Mulcasters Schollers, at the dore of the free-schole fownded by the Mercers.</field>

Dixi. Our next Arch of triumph, was erected aboue the Conduit in Fleetstreete, into which (as into the long and beauteous gallery of the Citie) his Maiestie being entered; a fane off (as if it had beene some swelling Promentory, or rather some inchanted Castle guarded by tenne thousand harmelesse spirits) did his eye encounter another Towre of Pleasure. Presenting it selfe. Fourescore and ten foote in height, and fiftie in breadth; the gate twentie foote in the perpendicular line, and fourteene in the ground line: The two Posternes were answerable to these that are set downe before: ouer the posternes riz vp in proportionable measures, two turrets, with battlementes on the tops: The middest of the building was laid open to the world, and great reason it should be so, for the Globe of the world, was there seene to mooue, being fild with all the degrees, and states that are in the land: and these were the mechanicall and dead limmes of this carued bodie. As touching those that had the vse of motion in it, and for a need durst haue spoken, but that there was no stuffe fit for their mouthes. The principall and worthiest was Astræa, (Iustice) sitting aloft, as being newly descended from heauen, gloriously attirde; all her garments being thickely strewed with starres: a crowne of starres on her head: a Siluer veile couering her eyes. Hauing tolde you that her name was Iustice, I hope you will not put mee to describe what properties she held in her hands, sithence euery painted cloath can informe you. Directly vnder her, in a Cant by her selfe, was Arate (vertue) inthronde, her garments white, her head crowned, and vnder her Fortuna: her foote treading on the Globe, that moude beneath her: Intimating, that his Maiesties fortune, was aboue the world, but his vertues aboue his fortune. Inuidia. Enuy, vnhandsomely attirde all in blacke, her haire of the same colour, filletted about with snakes, stood in a darke and obscure place by her selfe, neere vnto Vertue, but making shew of a fearefulnesse to approach her and the light: yet still &amp; anon, casting her eyes, sometimes to the one side beneath, where on seuerall Greeces sate the foure cardinall vertues: Viz. In habiliments, fitting to their natures. Iustitia. Fortitudo. Temperantia. Prudentia. And sometimes throwing a distorted and repining countenance to the other opposite seate, on which, his Maiesties foure kingdomes were aduanced. Viz. England. Scotland. France. Ireland. All of them, in rich Robes and Mantles; crownes on their heads, and Scepters with pensild scutchions in their hands, lined with the coats of the particuler kingdomes: for very madnesse, that she beheld these glorious obiects, she stood feeding on the heads of Adders. The foure Elements in proper shapes, (artificially and aptly expressing their qualities) vpon the approch of his Maiestie, went round in a proportionable and euen circle, touching that cantle of the Globe, (which was open) to the full view of his Maiestie, which being done, they bestowed themselues in such comely order, and stood so, as if the Eronie had beene held vp on the tops of their fingers. vpon distinct Ascensions, (nearly raisde within the hollow wombe of the Globe) were placed all the states of the land, from the Nobleman to the Ploughman, among whom there was not one word to bee heard, for you must imagine as Virgil saith: Ægl. 4. Magnus ab integro seclorum nascitur ordo. Lam redit at virgo redeunt Saturnia regna. Astræa. That it was now the golden world, in which there were few parts. All the tongues that went in this place, was the tongue of Zeale, whose personage was put on by W. Bourne, one of the seruants to the young Prince. [Zeale.] And thus went his speach. The populous Globe of this our English Ile, Seemde to mooue backward, at the funerall pile, Of her dead female Maiestie. All stares From Nobles downe to spirits of meaner Fares, Mooude opposite to Nature and to Peace, As if these men had bin Th' Antipodes, But see, the vertue of a Regall eye, Th'attractiue wonder of mans Maiestie, Our Globe is drawne in a right line agen, And now appeare new faces, and new men. The Elements, Earth, Water, Ayre, and Fire, (Which euer clipt a naturall desire, To combat each with other, being at first,) Created enemies to fight their worst, See at the peacefull presence of their King, How quietly they moude, without their sting: Earth not deuouring, Fire not defacing, Water not drowning, &amp; the Ayre not chasing: But proping the queint Fabrick that heere stands, Without the violence of their wrathfull hands. Mirror of times, lo where thy Fotune sits, Aboue the world, and all our humaine wits, But thy hye Vertue aboue that: what pen, Or Art, or braine can reach thy vertue then? At whose immortall brightnes and true light, Enuies infectious eyes haue lost their sight, Her snakes (not daring to shoot-forth their stings Gainst such a glorious obiect) downe she stings Their forkes of Venome into her owne mawe, Whilst her ranke teeth the glittering poisons chawe, For tis the property of Enuies blood, To dry away at euery kingdomes good, Especially when shee had eyes to view, These foure maine vertues figurde all in you, Iustice in causes, Fortitude gainst foes, Temprance in spleene, and Prudence in all those, And then so rich an Empyre, whose fayre brest, Contaynes foure Kingdomes by your entrance blest By Bruce diuided, but by you alone, All are againe vnited and made One, Whose fruitfull glories shine so far and euen, They touch not onely earth, but they kisse heauen, From whence Astræa is descended hither, Who with our last Queenes Spirit, fled vp thither, Fore-knowing on the earth, she could not rest, Till you had lockt her in your rightfull brest. And therefore all Estates, whose proper Arts, Liue by the breath of Maiestie, had harts Burning in holy Zeales immaculate fires, With quenchles Ardors, and vnstaind desires, To see what they now see, your powerful Grace, Reflecting joyes on every subjects face These paynted flames and yellow burning Stripes, Vpon this roab, being but as showes and types, Of that great Zeale. And therefore in the name Of this glad Citie, whither no Prince euer came, More lou'd, more long'd for, lowely I intreate, You'ld be to her as gracious as y'are great: So with reuerberate shoutes our Globe shall ring, The Musicks close being thus: God saue our King. If there be any glorie to be won by writing these lynes, I do freelie bestow it (as his due) on Thô. Middleton, in whose braine they were begotten, though they were deliuered heere: Qua nos non fes imnes ipsi, vix ea nostra voco. But hauing peiced vp our wings now againe with our owne feathers; suffer vs a while to be pruning them, and to lay them smooth, whilst this song, which went foorth at the sound of Hault-boyes, and other lowde instruments, flyes along with the trayne. Cant. Where are all these Honors owing? Why are seas of people flowing? Tell mee, tell me Rumor, Though it be thy Humor More often to belying, Than from thy breath to haue trueth flying: Yet alter, now that fashion, And without the streame of passion, Let thy voyce swim smooth and cleare, When words want gilding, then they are most deere Behold where Ioue and all the States, Of Heau'n, through Heau'ns seauen siluer gates, All in glory riding (Backs of Clowds bestriding) The milky waie do couer, With starry Path being measur'd ouer, The Deities conuent, In Ioues high Court of Parliament. Rumor thou doest loose thine aymes, This is not Ioue, but One, as great, King IAMES. And now take we our flight vp to Temple-bar, (the other ende of this our Gallery) where by this time, his Majestie is vpon the poynt of giuing a gratious and Princely Fare-well to the Lord Major, and the Citie: But that his eye meeting a seauenth beautifull object, is invited by that, to delay awhile his (lamented) departure. The Building being set out thus. The Front or Surface of it was proportioned in euery respect like a Temple, being dedicated to Ianus as by this inscripti? ouer the Ianus head may appeare. Iano Quadri fronti Sacrum. The height of the whole Aedifice, from the grownd line to the top, was 57 foote, the full bredth of it 18. foote: the thicknes of the Passage 12. The personages that were in this Temple, are these. 1. The principall person, Peace. 2. By her stood, Wealth. 3. Beneath the feet of Peace, lay Mars (War) groueling. 4. And vpon her right hand (but with some little descent) was seated Quiet, the first hand-maid of Peace. 5. Shee had lying at her feete, Tumult. 6. On the other side was the seconde hand-mayd, Libertie at whose feete lay a Catte. 7. This person trod vpon Seruitude. 8. The third handmaid was Safety. 9. Beneath her was Danger, 10. The fourth attendant was, Fælicitie: 11. At her feete, Vnhappines. Within the Temple was an Altar, to which, vpon the approch of the King, a Flamin appeares, and to him, the former Genius of the Citie. The effect of whose speech was, that whereas the Flamin came to performe rites there, in honour of one Anna a goddesse of the Romaines, the Genius vowes, that none shall doe Sacrifice there, but himselfe, the offring that he makes being, the Heart of the Citie, &amp;c. And thus haue wee (lowely and aloofe) followed our Soueraigne through the seauen Triumphal gates of this his Court Royall, which name, as London receiued at the rysing of the Sunne; so now at his going from her (euen in a moment) She lost that honour: And being (like an Actor on a Stage) stript out of her borrowed Majestie, she resignes her former shape &amp; title of Citie, nor is it quite lost, considering it went along with him, to whom it is due. For such Vertue is begotten in Princes, that their verie presence hath power to turne a Village to a Citie, and to make a Citie appeare great as a Kingdome. Behold how glorious a Flower, Happinesse is, but how fading. The Minutes (that lackey at the heeles of Time) run not faster away then do our joyes. What tongue could haue exprest the raptures on which the soule of the Citie was carried beyond it selfe, for the space of manie houres? What wealth could haue allurde her to haue closde her eies, at the comming of her King, and yet See, her Bridegrome is but stept from her, and in a Minute (nay in shorter time, then a thought can be borne) is she made a Widdow. All her consolation being now to repeate ouer by roate those Honors, which lately she had perfectly by hart: And to tell of those joyes, which but euen now, shee reallie behelde; yet thus of her absent, beloued, do I heare her gladly and heartily speaking.

      <field name="fulltext">The Pageant in the Strond. The Citie of Westminster and Dutchy of Lancaster, perceiuing what preparation their neighbor citie made to entertain her Souerainge; though in greatnes they could not match her, yet in greatnes of Loue and Duerie, they gaue testimonie, that both were equall. And in token they were so, hands and hearts went together: and in the Strond, erected vp a Monument of their affection. The Inuention was a Rayne-bow, the Moone, Sunne, and the seauen Starres, called the Pleiades, being aduaunced betweene two Pyramides: Electra (one of those seauen hanging in the aire, in figure of a Comet) was the speaker, her words carrying this effect. That as his Majestie had left the Citie of Loudon, happy, by deliuering it fr? the noyse of tumult: so he would crowne this place with the like joyes; which being done, shee reckons vp a number of blessings, that will follow vpon it. The worke of this was thought vpon, begun and made perfect in xij. daies. As touching those fiue which the Citie builded, the Arbor in Cheap-side, and the Temple of Ianus, at Temple-bar, were both of them begun and finisht in sixe weekes. The rest were taken in hande, first in March last, after his Maiestie was proclaymed, vpon which, at that time, they wrought till a Moneth after S. Iames his day following, and then gaue ouer by reason of the sicknes: At this second setting vpon the, six weekes more were spent. The Citie elected sixteene Comitties, to whom the Mannaging of the whole busines was absolutely referred of which number, foure were Aldermen, the other grauè Commoners. There were also Committies appoynted as Ouerseers, and Serueyors of the workes. Artificum Operarium que in hoc tam celebri apparatu, summa. summa. The Citie imployed in the Framing, building, and setting vp of their fiue Arches, these officers and worke-men. A Clarke that attended on the Committies. Two officers that gaue Summons for their meetings. &amp;c. A clarke of the Workes. Two master-Carpenters. Painters. Of which nnmber, those that gaue the maine direction, and vndertooke for the whole busines, were only these seauen. William Friselfield. George Mosse. Iohn Knight. Paul Isacson. Samuell Goodrick. Richard Wood. George Heron. Caruers. Ouer whom, Stephen Harrison Ioyner was appoynted chiefe; who was the sole Inuentor of the Architecture, and from whom all directions, for so much as belonged to Caruing, Ioyning, Molding, and all other worke in those fiue Pageants of the Citie (Paynting excepted) were set downe. Ioyners 80 Carpenters. 60 Turners. 6 Laborers to them. 6 Sawyers. 12 Laborers during all the time, and for the day of the Triumph. 70 Besides these, there were other Artificers, As: Plommers, Smythes, Molders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Reader Reader, you must vnderstand, that a regard, being had that his Majestie should not be wearied with tedious speeches: A great part of those which are in this Booke set downe, were left vnspoken: So that thou doest here receiue them as they should have bene deliuered, not as they were.
