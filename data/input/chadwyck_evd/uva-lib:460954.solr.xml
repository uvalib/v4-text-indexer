      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. Inside View of the Temple, dedicated to Bel the God of Fire, with the flactaga, or sacred fire burning. HERE all the Irish Priests and Druids meet on the last day of October, on the evening of which day it is enacted that no other fire shall be used throughout the kingdom, in order that all the fires may be derived from this, which being lighted up as a fire of sacrifice, would render the rest propitious and holy. Priests, Druids, and PriestessesâEnter, bowing to the flactaga. CHORUS. Now the wintry Moons appear, Chilly storms deform the year; Mighty Bel, to thee we bow, Kindly genial heat bestow, In lucid flame thy chearing rays Thro' Cottage, Palace, Camp shall blaze; A glowing heat (no hostile brand) To purify and bless the land. Trumpets sounded without, Cobthach, the usurping monarch of Munster and murderer of his brother Laughaire, enters, preceded by troops, &amp;c. who bow to the altar.âSound of warlike instrumentsâ enter, Sitric, a Danish chief, followed by Danes, he kneels respectfully to Cobthach, who raises him affectionately, pointing to a Banner, on which is written âSitric (the Dane) for his services, declared heir to Cobthach;ââSitric bows gratefully for the favour bestowedâenter hastily, a Chief, he presents a pacquet to Cobthach, who, much agitated, gives it Sitric to open, ordering the soldiers to withdraw, who exeunt, each having lit his torch, following in procession the Druids, &amp;c. Sitric draws Cobthach towards him, and shews him the contents of the pacquet, âthe murdered Laughaire's offspring live.â The former, much agitated, asks Sitric's advice, who draws out of his bosom a miniature of Maon, demanding if he is the person to be dreaded? which Cobthach answers in the affirmative, presenting a dagger to Sitric, who, receiving it with savage motion, intimates the pleasure with which he undertakes his death. Cobthach thanks him for his promptitude, and eagerly produces another miniature, that of Moriat, Maon's wife. Sitric seems struck with her beauty!âDruids cross the stage, and Cobthach and Sitric follow to consult them relative to the truth of the intelligence they have received.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. A romantic View, with a small Hovel on. Enter Kildare, who taps at the door of the hovel, from which ENTER, cautiously, Saba and Connor, they intimate Moriat is asleep, and request him not to disturb her. DUET. Hushâhushâlet silence reign, Sleep, now lulls her tortur'd brain, Slumbers calm her breast; View the Heiress of a throne, See her pillow the cold stone, Nor dare disturb her rest. And hark!âheigho!âthe passing sigh, Alack, and well-a-day! Tells how fleet will honors fly, And greatness pass away. During this duet, Moriat is seen through the hovel door sleeping with her infant clasped in her armsâ she sighs responsive to the musicâKildare, &amp;c. retire. âShe awakes, kisses her child, and comes forward. âKildare approaches her, and she eagerly enquires what success he has had in search of her husband? âhe informs her none:âDruids cross the stage âa thought strikes her, and she is determined to consult themâas she is going off for that purpose, the child runs from the hovel towards her, she kisses him with rapture, seemingly condemning herself, that her affection for the parent should even for a moment cause her to forget his childâMoriat, &amp;c. go off, taking leave of Connor and Saba affectionately. âEnter Cobthach and Sitric, the latter still gazing on Moriat's miniature, till he is rouzed from his reverie by Cobthach, when he again renews his vows of murderâanother party of Druids cross the stage, which awakens their dormant inclination of consulting them, and they EXEUNT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. The Dargle, by Moonlight. The principal Druid discovered playing on a harp on a rocky fragment. Enter cautiously, and with religious dread, Kildare, Moriat, and ChildâKildare retires on the watchâMoriat bends to the Druid, and anxiously enquires her absent husband's fate. He consults the oracle, and the following answer is delivered, accompanied by the harp. AIRâDRUID. Hid from the Sun and cooling breeze, In a cavern's dismal gloom; Mourning child and consort lost, Frantic Maon courts his tomb. Speed to his aid much injur'd fair, And snatch thy monarch from despair. Moriat appears much agitated, but recovering, kneels in thankfulness clasping her Child, and is departing in search of her husband, when Kildare re-enters hastily, and informs her the murderer of her father approaches, she requests the Druid's advice, who pointing to a chasm in the rocks, they conceal themselves. Cobthach and Sitric enter, the former dreading to consult the oracle 'till encouraged by the latterâ the Druid makes signs of horror and disgustâCobthach, irritated, half draws his swordâthe Moon is obscuredâDruid disappearsâthunder, light'ning, &amp;c. and through a fragment of the rock in transparent letters, appears âmurderer despair and die;â which they view with terrorâSitric hurries Cobthach from the spot, and (his eyes fixed on the inscription) compells him to retire.âMoriat, &amp;c. rush from their concealment, and exeunt, with dread on the opposite side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IV. Outside of a Fisherman's Cottageâ(dawn of morning.) Enter, from it, Fishermen with their nets. DUETâFISHERMEN. Now the finny brood united, O'er the buoyant liquid sweep; Or lost in wanton sport, delighted, Plunge adown the azure steep: Yielding to the wiley plan, Of the jolly fisherman. Softly sweet the breeze is blowing, Wand'ring streamlets swell the flood; While with health and pleasure glowing, Jocund pastime yields us food: Crowning gay the wiley plan, Of the jolly fisherman. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE V. The Salmon leap. Fishermen cross the stage, and seem to point out the spot where they mean to throw their nets; after whichâEnter Kildare, Moriat, and Child, the two latter wearied with their long walk in quest of her husbandâKildare points to a small cell cut in the rock, where they may reposeâshe enters it supporting her child, and, giving Kildare her bracelet, by way of token, requests him to pursue his search, resolved there to await his return. Sitric enters gazing on her miniatureâshe, absorbed in attention to her child, not observing him âhe starts on beholding her, and, comparing the miniature with the original, is divided between affection and the vow he had made to destroy herâaffection succeeds, and he dashes his drawn dagger to the earth, which alarming her, she starts up with her childâher parental scream arouses Sitric's attendant guards, who rush on pointing their spears to her breastâhe commands them to withdraw, and, falling at her feet, confesses his intention to murder her, but vows rather to sacrifice his life than do her an injuryâtrumpets are sounded without, he intimates Cobthach's troops approach, she accepts his protection, and they hurry off, (guarded by him,) during the sound of trumpets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VI. A wood, with the entrance into a cavern in the centre. Enter Kildare, fatigued and despondent, leans on his sword, sighing, at the entranceâa deep moan reverberates withinâhe starts much agitated, and undeterminedâa second moan heard, and with much trepidation he enters the cavern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VII. The dark Cavern, into which steps leadâ on one side a rough monument, on which is this inscription, âSACRED TO A MURDERED FATHER;â on the other, the following, âTO A LOST WIFE AND CHILD,â a lamp and his sword, &amp;c. fixed on the scraggy fragment of a rock near the first monument. Maon despondently descends the steps, gazes on the first monument, from which he snatches his sword, and seems wildly resolved on revenge; but turning towards the other bursts into tears, and throwing his sword from him, falls in anguish on the earth.âKildare timidly enters, and approaching Maon, he starts up wildly, snatches his sword, and places himself in an attitude of defenceâKildare kneels, and attempts to sooth himâMaon, franticly, dashes him to the earth; and Kildare, in vain, endeavours to make him understand his errand, till, in their struggle, discovering his wife's bracelet, Maon awakes from his delirium, recognizes it, and with joy faints in Kildare's armsâat length recovers, embraces, thanks him, and snatching up his sword and shield (Kildare leading the way) they quit the cavern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VIII. Entrance to Cavern, as before. Kildare and Maon, on the point of quitting it, perceive peasants approaching, and return. Enter Connor and Saba, he bids her farewell, intimating his errand is to raise the peasantry in behalf of Moriat, displaying his shield, which bears this device, âFidelity.â RECITATIVEâCONNOR. Adieuâfor a wrong'd prince my sword I wield, Honour my guide, Fidelity my shield; Soon shall our peasants emulate their sires, Freedom's no more, if loyalty expires. Exit. BALLADâSABA. [1.] My Connor his lips are as ruddy as morning The fairest of pearls do but mimic his teeth: And in ringlets so playful, his mild brow adorning, His hairs Cupid's bow-string, and roses his breath. Smiling, beguiling, chearing, endearing, Together we oft o'er the heather have stray'd; Fondly invited, and gladly delighted, I listen'd all day to my dear Irish lad. 2. No roebuck more fleet e're can skim o'er the mountain, No veteran bolder meet danger or scar; He's sprightly, he's sightly, and bright as the fountain, His eyes twinkle love, though he's gone to the war. Smiling, beguiling, &amp;c Exit. After the song, Maon and Kildare proceed cautiously from the cavern, and exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IX. The Scalp. Enter Cobthach and Troops, which (on a Messenger's arrival) he places in ambushâSitric leads on Moriat and Child, pleads his passion with fervencyâshe, astonished, treats him with disdain, pointing to her child, and vowing eternal truth to her husband, whose aid she invokesâSitric, grown desperate, seizes herâthey struggleâshe dashes him from her, and Cobthach with troops surrounds them âSitric, to prevent suspicion, shakes him by the hand with apparent exultation, pointing to Moriat as his prisoner, and she is guarded off; Sitric endeavouring to convince her of his attachment and contrition, and Cobthach of his promptitude to execute his commands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE X. Back View of the Round Tower. Moriat and Child cross the stage, as prisoners, followed by Cobthach, Sitric, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE XI. View of a Round Tower partly in ruins. Enter Cobthach, Sitric, Moriat, and Guards, the Child and Moriat are imprisoned, and Sitric receives orders to dispatch themâon Cobthach's exit, he determines on their release; and for that purpose bribes a centinel who is placed over them; and he is near accomplishing his plan when Cobthach re-enters, and to prevent discovery he stabs the centinel. Cobthach, suspicious, demands the keys; and the prison doors being again closed on Moriat and her Child, he retires rebuking Sitric, who, enraged, vows vengeance, but seeing some one approaching, retires. âEnter Kildare and Maon bewildered on their way, which, as they are exploring, a voice from the round tower assails their ears, at the same time a scarf being waved from the loop-hole, Should some pitying stranger near, Moriat's mournful story hearâ To her lov'd lord this token bear. Maon starts, and recognizing his wife's voice, accuses Kildare of deceptionâher scarf is dropt from the tower, which, convincing him of her situation, drives him to distraction; and Kildare, in vain attempting to force the prison door, is prevented by Sitric, who, during this, had been comparing the miniature with the original, and determining to get him into his powerâMaon gazes wildly on Sitric, who, with his accustomed hypocrisy, proffers his servicesâMaon displays the scarf, intimating all he loves on earth is confined in that towerâSitric seems to regret his inability to assist him; and, as he is going again to endeavour to burst the door open, again stops him; and, a thought having struck him, shews a small key, which he tells him by a secret pass will lead to her prison, and offers to conduct him there, cunningly hinting aside, it will be a proper place to dispatch him inâtrumpets heard withoutâMaon is forced off by Sitric and Kildare.</field>

Enter Maon, with his sword drawn, preceded by Sitric with a torchâMaon explores the cemetery in vain, and tells him he must be mistaken, as there is no way from thence to Moriat's dungeonâ Sitric seems to know as much, but tells him still to searchâhe appears by accident to put out the torch, and seems happy in having that opportunity to commit the murderâfeeling for Maon, catches his hand, which he seems cordially to shake, while with the other he is preparing to give the blow, when soft music is heard, and the following words plaintively sung: Mourn Maon, thy bride, who for thee must expire, The victim of him who has murder'd thy sire. Maon seems rivetted to the spot ready to burst with indignationâSitric, astonished, for the present drops his purpose, but soon recovering himself, resolves to accomplish his purposeâwhen a deep groan is heard, the cemetery appears of a fiery hue, and a figure in transparent armour crosses the stage pointing to SitricâMaon agitated, and Sitric with all the horror of guilt marked on his countenance, and trembling limbsâMaon pursues the figure, a chasm opens, receives it, and with it, as it closes, the blade of his drawn sword; he endeavours to extricate it, at length succeeds; and, enveloped in ruins and scattered fragments of armour, a skeleton appears in lieu of the figureâ Sitric's horror encreasesâthe skeleton points to a doorâanother groan is heardâthe skeleton sinksâ the cemetery assumes its former hue, and the door flying open, stairs appear visible, leading to Moriat's dungeon, Maon ascends them, followed by Sitric, horror-struck.</field>

Hark! the sprightly bugle horn, Loud laughs each milder note to scorn; Sun beams spangle bright the spear, And fill the prowling wolf with fear: While echo counts in tales of mirth, The crimson'd stains that paint the earth. Enter Connor, displaying his shield, conjures them to join his causeâthey swear to assist him, andâ Exeunt.</field>

A Dungeon in the Round Tower, to which ruined steps lead; in the centre, a grating and passage which is terminated by a door strongly plated with ironâthrough the grating, by means of a melancholy lamp, the Child is discovered asleep, Moriat on the steps, her hair dishevelled, gazing despondently on himâa strong door at the side wings, as another entrance to the dungeonâ on part of a rock an hour glass, intimating her time is nearly come.âShe seems resolved to meet her fate with fortitude, but is all anxiety for her Child. Loud clanking of chains without, Cobthach enters, and reiterates his threats on her non-compliance; she refuses to answer him 'till he releases her child, which he does, and they tenderly embrace, she treating him with the utmost disdain âhe is about to dispatch her, when the Figure stalks across, pointing to the door of the dungeon, that terminates the Child's prisonâIt is burst openâSitric and Maon rush onâSitric, snatching his uplifted dagger with savage joy, stabs Cobthach, who fallsâMoriat faints in the arms of her husband, who, wildly, catching up his Child, an affectionate interview succeeds;âSitric perceiving their happiness, is fired with jealousy, and regrets the having destroyed one rival but to render another happyânot finding an opportunity of openly dispatching him, he rings the alarm bell, and Danish Guards rush on; he orders them to seize Maon, as the murderer of Cobthach, they obey, and his wife and child are torn from himâsoldiers, pointing their weapons at his breast to prevent their re-union.â Scene closes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE XVI. Romantic View, an Hovel attached to the Wing. Enter Connor, taps at the hovel door, from which Enter Sabaâthey embraceâshe doubtfully enquires his success. DUET to an old Irish air. She. Still must droop Maon? still weep his fair one? Still their sweet babe join his fond parents sigh? Her hair it is silk lightâher skin it is milk white, And dark is the blue of her bright rolling eye. He. Fate has dividedâtyrants derided, Meagre despair commands the deep sigh; But fate now relentingâto justice assenting, The big hour of vengeance proclaims to be nigh. She. Sweet thought alluringâbright hope assuring, Bids joy with rapture then beam in each eye! He. The theme of fame's story, companions in glory, For virtue now arm'd in her cause dare to die. As he sings the last stanza, the Huntsmen, with a band of Irish Peasantry armed, enter, lead by Kildare, who join in the following lines as CHORUS. Yes, the theme of fame's story, companions in glory, For virtue now arm'd, dare to conquer or die. Exeunt.</field>
