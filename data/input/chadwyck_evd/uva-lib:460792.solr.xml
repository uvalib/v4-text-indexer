      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —A Segment of the Zodiac, exhibiting the Sign of Aries—March discovered—Enter Spring. Air—Spring—“March, march, Ettrick and Teviotdale.” March, March, April is at the wing, March away, March, in quick time and good order, March, March, April's about to spring On to the stage, just beneath this sky border; Ramble off with your Ram. Lead him out like a Lamb, Room for the revels of mad-bully Taurus— April, on frolic bent, Comes, by gay Easter sent, Here, for a few merry days to reign o'er us. March, March, &amp;c. (Exit March) (The Sign Aries gradually gives place to Taurus—Exit Spring—End of March. Flourish) Enter April the First. Apr. “End of March—enter April.”—A fact, I protest, A plain stage direction—not meant for a jest; A cue for my entrance, to act as a chorus, And not for the entrance of Sol into Taurus. And, now to be brief, which you know is my forte, For my reign and my showers are equally short, I am April the First, and, according to rule, Have a right, for one day, all the world to be-fool. Imagine this right, Cupid's jealousy waking! He'd have no fools on earth, that were not of his making; Not content with possessing unlimited powers, He begrudges me mine, for these twenty-four hours; But he can't deprive me of a laugh or a whim, And a subject for sport I'll this day form of him; Love once, it is said, made a simpleton wise— Only once—for what reason I cannot surmise, In a fit of caprice, or from pure contradiction. Some vow it's a fact—I suspect it's a fiction; But be that as it may, of the story Love's vain, And the poets have sung it again and again. On the stage it's been put too, by Garrick, Arne, Bishop, And now, in my own way, I've ventured to dish up The young gudgeon, Cymon, in hope that he will Prove, as the French say, a fine “Poison d'Avril.” If not, more fool I, and the laugh's against me, So now to begin, and see what you shall see. (clouds open, and discover Merlin) Air—April—“Barring all pother.” First, Merlin, the Wizard of Wales, behold, To bring him to Greece, Mr. Garrick made bold; With the story he'd nothing on earth to do, But the greater the nonsense, the better for you. For barring all pother, With one and the other, We'll make them all fools in their turn. (at the end of the first verse exit Merlin and Urganda is seen in his place) The next is Urganda, a fairy high-flown, By neither Boccaccio, nor Dryden known; Her charms are so potent that none can withstand her— But love, you will find, makes a goose of Urganda. So barring all pother, &amp;c. (at the end of the second verse exit Urganda, and Cymon is seen) Here's Cymon, who, till he by love was taught, Knew nothing, and “whistled for want of thought;” If all were to whistle who think they think, What a saving there would be in printer's ink. For barring all pother, &amp;c. (at the end of the third verse exit Cymon and enter Iphigenia) There's Iphigenia, called Sylvia—why? 'Twould puzzle a conjuror to reply; For whichever you please you may give your voice, For “you pays your money, and takes your choice.” And barring all pother, &amp;c. The rest I've no time to particularise, There are shepherds with hooks, shepherdesses with eyes; A judge, of whose judgment we can't well boast, And another old woman as deaf as a post. So barring all pother, &amp;c. So I'll leave them now for themselves to speak, In the language of Garrick, supposed to be Greek; But run into rhyme on the pastoral plan, sir, For it's not a burlesque, nor an extravaganza, But a something or other Which pleased your grandmother, And we hope will please you in your turn. (at the end of the song, exit April) The clouds, which have closed upon each Tableau, now clear off altogether, and discover</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. —The Garden in front of Urganda's Palace. Enter Merlin, followed by Urganda. Urg. Yet hear me, Merlin— Mer. Madam, I have heard— And seldom anything much more absurd. As I'm a conjuror, I can't conceive How I so long could in your truth believe, And blush to think I have been so betrayed, And made a fool, for a fool ready made. A dolt!—an idiot!—oh! I shall go wild. Urg. Great Merlin, jealous of a simple child! How can you think so meanly of my taste? Mer. Upon the idle air your words you waste; If you would prove my dark suspicions vain, Send silly Cymon to his friends again! Urg. 'Tis out of pity I retain him here— Mer. Your pity is to love akin too near. With him or me make up your mind to part— Urg. Dear Merlin! you alone possess my heart! Mer. 'Tis false! and mine, you've managed so to rend it, No stitch that you can take in time will mend it! But consolation in one thought alone is— You shall smart under the lex talionis! Of hopeless passion feel in turn the pain, Love is dethroned, and here revenge shall reign. Still shall my power your vile arts confound, And Cymon's cure shall be Urganda's wound. (Exit) Urg. “And Cymon's cure shall be Urganda's wound!” What can he mean? Enter Fatima. Fat. No good, ma'am, I'll be bound. Urg. Ah! then you heard his dire denunciation! Fat. It's put me all into a twitteration! Urg. Fear nothing. Fat. I can't help it—something frightful He's sure to do—he's so uncommon spiteful! Urg. My power is great as his; and as to spite, Match him at that I rather think I might. Fat. Match him! why don't you match him?—be his wife! And make him miserable all his life! Urg. Alas! I am in love. Fat. In love, forsooth, With a poor, pitiful, half-witted youth. A gosling, who can't say “Bo” to a goose! Of all your witchery is that the use? Charms such as yours should make men fools, not cure 'em; Into a fine fool's Paradise still lure 'em! Why, you might turn the brains of a whole college Ere you could give that lout a grain of knowledge. (Cymon is heard whistling) Urg. Silence!—he comes!—his whistle sweet I hear. Fat. Ah! for his whistle you pay much too dear. Enter Cymon. Urg. How sad he looks! Fat. Stupid, I say. Cym. Heigho! Urg. What is the matter, Cymon? Cym. I don't know. Fat. Are you not well? Cym. Oh!—yes—I'm very well. Urg. What do you sigh for, then? Cym. How can I tell? Urg. Is there a wish Urganda cannot grant? What do you want? Cym. I don't know what I want— Oh—yes—I do—I want— Urg. What, dearest? say, And it is yours! Cym. I want to go away. Urg. Away from me! Alack! where would you go? Cym. I can't tell. Urg. For what reason? Cym. I don't know. Fat. Let him go anywhere—he's good for naught— For he knows nothing, and he won't be taught. Urg. To me his sweet simplicity is charming! If but his heart I could succeed in warming! Come, all ye loves and graces, to my aid! And through his eyes his slumbering soul invade. (waves her wand) Music—Entré of Loves and Graces, in the costume of the Eighteenth Century. BALLET (during which Cymon gradually falls asleep) Urg. Look, Fatima! I vow he's gone to sleep! Fat. You'd better turn him out among the sheep. Urg. Cupid, all arm'd and powder'd, moved him not! Fat. It was a waste of powder and of shot, Leave him to sleep, nor useless trouble take With one who never will be wide-awake. Urg. As a reproach, these flowers I'll on him lay, (places her bouquet on his bosom) Fat. You'll find they're on him merely thrown away. (Exeunt Urganda and Fatima) Enter Merlin. Mer. My art shall now to Cymon's eyes display, A damsel lovelier than dawning day— Her charms shall wrest his mind from folly's sway. Enter April. Apr. And make a fool of him another way. Music—Merlin waves his wand, and changes to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Third. —A Sequestered Spot—In a bower opposite to where Cymon lies asleep Iphigenia is discovered in a magic slumber—She has a bouquet in her hand. Mer. (touching Iphigenia's nosegay with his wand) That magic touch would to those flowers impart, A charm, to make like touchwood Cymon's heart; Now to some sort of sense awake he may. (Exit) Apr. Some other sort of nonsense, he would say. Music—Cymon awakes, rubs his eyes, gets up, and stares about him vacantly—then taking up his staff, walks away whistling, till he comes close to Iphigenia—he starts, rubs his eyes again, and stands gazing in astonishment at her, leaning on his staff. Apr. “The fool of nature stood with stupid eyes, “And gaping mouth, that testified surprise.” Hem! Dryden! There's the very situation— Of glorious John, a lively illustration. The youth, completely posed, beholds the fair, Reposing sweetly, 'mid the poses there. Composing altogether, so to speak, Really a most imposing pose plastique. Cym. What's here? 'tis something fallen from the skies, Or am I dreaming' still with open eyes? 'Tis like a woman—but so wondrous fair— 'Tis something like a woman, I declare! What in my breast is bobbing so about? It must be what they call my heart, no doubt! Apr. He never knew he had one till this minute, And now, he can't think what the plague is in it. Cym. Oh! dear! how it is thumping just at present! Apr. He finds it odd, but not at all unpleasant. Iph. (waking) Ah! Cym. (retreating) Oh! it is alive—and speaks! Oh! my, What eyes! Iph. Who's there? Cym. (timidly) Me. Iph. Who may “me” be? Cym. I! Iph. Have you no name? Cym. They call me Cymon. Iph. Oh! May be you're simple Cymon, then? Apr. Just so. (Exit April) Iph. And to our great Queen you belong. Cym. I do. But I much rather would belong to you. Nobody'd call me “simple Cymon” then! Iph. (aside) He's not more simple than are most young men— And better looking than I yet saw any! (aloud) I've heard of you, young gentleman, from many. What are you staring at? Cym. You— Iph. But you shouldn't! Cym. But I can't help it—could you if you couldn't? I never saw your like! are you a fairy? Iph. Oh! dear, sir, no, indeed—quite the contrary. Cym. Quite the contrary—what's that? I can't guess. Iph. Only a poor Arcadian shepherdess. Cym. I'm not so sure of that—Urganda's charms Ne'er caused within my breast such fond alarms. You have bewitched me—I'm transformed—enchanted! In short, I'm quite another creature. Iph. Granted. For you are one beside yourself, I vow! You've lost your wits. Cym. I'd none to lose till now. Tell me your name? Iph. Sylvia. Cym. Sylvia! how sweet! Sylvia my tongue for ever could repeat! Iph. Farewell! Cym. Nay, do not go! Iph. I must, indeed! Bless you, I've got a flock of sheep to feed. Cym. When shall we meet again? Iph. This afternoon. Cym. In half-an-hour? Iph. Nay, that will be too soon— Say, in three quarters of an hour, at least. Cym. I will be there, before the chimes have ceased. Iph. But where is there? Cym. Oh! anywhere you please. Iph. Down by the river, then, beneath yon trees. Cym. In the meanwhile, that nosegay let me treasure. Iph. In change for yours? Cym. Oh! with the greatest pleasure! Duet—Iphigenia and Cymon—Bishop. Iph. Take this nosegay, gentle youth! Cym. And you, sweet maid, take mine; Iph. Unlike these flowers, be thy fair truth; Cym. Unlike these flowers, be thine. These changing soon, Will soon decay; Together Be sweet till noon, Then pass away. Fair, for a time, their transient charms appear; But truth, unchang'd, shall bloom for ever here. (Exeunt Cymon and Iphigenia) Enter April. Apr. Now this is what bards have thought worthy their strains, And how Cymon's supposed to have come by his brains; When, really, I think that one needn't be clever To prove he's a much greater fool now than ever. Here's a wench, till this morning, a sight he'd ne'er got of, That he'd rush into church with, not knowing a jot of Her family tree, or her family acres, Or who is to pay even butchers and bakers! By-the-bye—you mayn't know much about her yourselves, Unless you have lately been dusting your shelves; For who, upon earth, into Dryden now looks? Or any such old musty poetry books; So as Chorus my duty I'll do con amore, And briefly run over the heads of the story. Song—April—“The Hunting of the Hare.” “Songs of shepherds and rustical roundelays, Formed in fancy and whistled on reeds, Sung to solace young nymphs upon holidays;” You'll have lots as the drama proceeds. But there's some history, Magic and mystery, Mix'd up in this story, So if you'd be Charm'd, enlightened, Your intellects brightened, And interest heighten'd, Just listen to me. Once in Cyprus; it happen'd a time on, there Dwelt a nobleman, wealthy to boot; He'd a son, whom the people called Cymon, there, Which, in plain English, was calling him “Brute.” And 'twasn't a wonder, For so did he blunder, No schoolmaster under The Cyprian sun, So clever could be as To teach young ideas To shoot in this stupid young son of a gun. Queen Urganda, for some magic jugglery, Culling of simples one morning hard by, Thought, whilst making of simples a smugglery, She might as well smuggle our friend, simple Cy. A husband she wanted, And took it for granted He'd be quite enchanted To make her his bride; But for fear of refusal, She tried to bamboozle A famous old foozle, Called Merlin, beside. Now, you're aware, 'twas that same Mr. Merlin here, (Whom for the simples Urganda had cut,) Hooked, with a magical bouquet, a girl in here, Out of joint the Queen's nosegay to put; But, what you might never guess, She is no shepherdess; Though by her rustic dress Taken for such. Though Dorcas here brought her, She's no more her daughter, Than you, sir, in short are, And that isn't much. Don't you imagine, though, she an impostor is, Like so many you elsewhere have seen; Prince, her father, of famed Famagosta is, She's, of course, the Princess Iphigene. But, though you have heard of it, Don't say a word of it, There mayn't be a third of it, True, by the way. (spoken) —(For really authorities do so differ respecting historical facts that) From Sir Walter Raleigh To Mr. Macaulay, One can't swallow all a Chap chooses to say. (Exit)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fourth. —The Palace (as before). Enter Urganda and Fatima. Urg. Whither, my love—oh! whither art thou gone? I left him fast asleep here—and alone. What may this mean? Fat. 'Tis difficult to guess, And scarce can be accounted for unless We could imagine— Urg. What? in mercy, say! Fat. That when he woke—he rose and walked away. Urg. It must be so—oh, fate! it is too clear! For had he not been gone, he'd still been here! And though to own it seems an impropriety, His absence causes me extreme anxiety. Fat. His absence causes me no thought unpleasant, He is so very absent when he's present. But, pardon me, one trifling observation— Will not your art afford you information? I thought a great enchantress, ma'am, like you, Knew everything that any one could do. Urg. A vulgar error—chase it from your mind; Consult the Fairy Library—you'll find, Like common mortals, we oft see but queerly, In matters which concern ourselves most nearly; And something, lately, has so dimm'd my sight, I cannot even read the stars aright. Fat. 'Tis love, no doubt—the envious little elf, Would blind the world, because he's blind himself. But here is Cymon coming, madam. Urg. Oh! The darling! what is it he's doing, though? He seems transported! how he laughs and skips! And what is it he presses to his lips? My nosegay! oh! at last my spells have caught him, And positively to his senses brought him. Fat. Or else he's gone out of them still more sadly. Urg. Let's be invisible, and listen! Fat. Gladly! (Urganda touches Fatima with her wand) Enter Cymon with Iphigenia's bouquet. Cym. Oh! thou dear nosegay—gazing thus on thee, The lovely giver still, methinks, I see! Urg. “The lovely giver!”—Fatima, dost hear? That must be I! Fat. To me, that's not so clear. Urg. Ha!— Fat. No offence!—but are those flowers the same You gave him, madam? Urg. Fatima!—for shame! How can you doubt? Fat. I really don't know how— But I do doubt, and very much, I vow! Cym. Never—oh! never with it will I part! Where shall I hide it?—here—yes, next my heart! For its divine enchantress wildly panting! Urg. “Divine enchantress!”—what more proof is wanting? Fat. Nothing—but of the nosegay, just one view— Something's changed him!—I think, the nosegay, too. Urg. Absurd!—but not a doubt shall long remain— (advancing) Cymon! Cym. (starting, and aside) Urganda! (aloud) How d'ye do again? Urg. Pray, who were you conversing with, just now? Cym. Nobody! Urg. Nay, I'm sure you will allow That you were talking! Cym. Talking! oh—yes, true— 'Twas to myself, you know; I often do. Fat. (aside) Evasion! oh! 'tis plain enough then, he Is not the innocent he used to be. Urg. But what was that you hid within your vest? Cym. Nothing! Fat. (aside) A downright fib, I do protest. Cymon no longer is the simple youth, Who could speak nothing but the simple truth! Urg. Was't nothing—that recalled to you the donor? Cym. Nothing, indeed. Urg. Oh! Cymon! Cym. 'Pon my honour! Fat. (aside) Upon his honour!—he improves a-pace! Impossible to lie with better grace! Urg. Come, don't be bashful, Cymon, there's a dear! It is a nosegay, which you treasure here. Cym. A nosegay! well—and what then if it be! Urg. Why, it is mine, I fancy—shew it me. Cym. What, give a thing, and take a thing—you couldn't! Urg. Take it from you? oh! no—for worlds I wouldn't! If it be mine. Cym. Nor would I yeld the prize, For countless worlds! Urg. What fire is in his eyes! What fervour in his language—he's in love! Fat. With somebody, no doubt, his ears above. Urg. With somebody!—why thus my soul alarm? Who but Urganda, here, his heart could warm? Fat. (aside) Hem! I have heard a question more polite, But to reply might not become me quite. Urg. Shew me those flowers! Cym. No! Urg. Ha! boy, beware! Cym. Pshaw! what a fuss you make about it—there! Now, are you satisfied? Urg. It is not mine! Fat. I told you so! The enchantress so divine, Is not Urganda! Urg. Fiends and tortures! say, Ungrateful youth! who gave you that bouquet? Cym. A person! Urg. Male or female? Cym. I can't tell— How should I know? Fat. Oh, come! that's mighty well, But won't do now. Urg. (aside) From head to foot I tremble With rage and jealousy! but I'll dissemble, Until I learn at whom the blow to strike. (aloud) Well, Cymon, I'm not angry! If you like This nosegay better than mine, keep it, pray. Fat. Only you needn't have thrown her's away On such an ugly creature! Cym. Ugly creature! She is perfection, both in form and feature! Fat. Oh! she is, is she? but you do not know! If she's a male or female! so! so! so! Good Master Simpleton, in what direction Chanced you to meet this pattern of perfection? Cym. I'll tell you nothing more about her, though I die for it! Urg. Leave him alone! Heigho! This is the work of Merlin, or of fate— Howe'er it be, I cannot Cymon hate! But let my rival of my wrath beware! Fat. First, you must find her out— Urg. Be that your care. Fat. (aside) So, I must find out everything, I see! In that case I'm the witch, I think—not she! (to Urganda) To set about it, then, without delay, Suppose you give him a half-holiday; He's certain to go seek his fair enslaver, And I will watch him. Urg. You'll do me a favour! (aloud to Cymon) Cymon, this morn, you said you wished to go Somewhere—though where, you didn't seem to know. Are you desirous still abroad to range? Cym. I must say I should like a little change. Air—Cymon. You gave me, last week, a young linnet, Shut up in a fine golden cage, Yet, how sad the poor thing was within it, Oh, how it did flutter and rage! Then he mop'd and he pin'd That his wings were confin'd, 'Till I opened the door of his den! Then so merry was he, And because he was free, He came to his cage back again. Fat. Make verses, too! and sings 'em! oh! in short, The fever's of the most malignant sort! Urg. And would you fly back, if I let you out? Cym. Of that how can you entertain a doubt? Fat. (aside) That's what I call a questionable answer. Urg. Well, from this moment, you are a free man, sir— Go where you please—return to, or desert me, And break my heart! Cym. No! don't! you really hurt me! Urg. (to Cymon) Au revoir! (aside to Fatima) Now, wench, prove yourself a clever one. (Exit) Fat. This is a wild goose chase, if there was ever one! Air—Cymon. Oh, liberty! liberty! liberty! Dear happy liberty! Nothing like thee, So merry and free. My linnet and I, Away we will fly, To liberty! liberty! liberty! (Exit, followed by Fatima) Enter April. Apr. Urganda's move is rather artful-dodgical Though seeming simple and ornithological; Cymon lets out a linnet, you'll remark, And then she lets out Cymon for a lark; There is a little bird that tells me, though, Urganda will, with some one, pluck a crow; And here she comes to call her fiends together. You know the proverb, “Birds of the same feather;” But don't be frightened—matters right to bring, I shall be always on—or at the wing. (Exit) Enter Urganda. Urg. Oh! now the truth of Merlin's words I've found, For Cymon's cure is poor Urganda's wound! But though I feel my power o'er Cymon flown, And Merlin's mightier spell am forced to own, Am I in magic art a bankrupt quite? Is this the mere stick that it seems to sight? Must I alone be doom'd to love in vain? No! all Arcadia shall partake my pain. If yet one fiend this wand of mine obeys, Arise, and set each bosom in a blaze. (music—Revenge rises) Let all who see my hated rival burn With passion; and be each despised in turn— Until to madness stung, they seize and tear Piecemeal the common cause of our despair. Music—the stage darkens—thunder and lightning— Jealousy, Hatred, and Despair arise, and exeunt, led by Revenge—Exit Urganda. Re-enter April. Apr. Thunder and lightning! well, the kettle of her wrath has completely over-boiled! I forget who remarked that there was “no fury like a woman foiled!” But I haven't the slightest doubt of the truth of the observation, And I think we're about to receive of it a remarkable corroboration. She's evidently going to play up old gooseberry in Arcadia, and set this peaceable nation Quarrelling in a way that was never seen, even in the Hall of Conciliation. Air—April—“Bow, wow, wow.” Arcadia's known full-well, of course, to every ignoramus, For mountains and for mutton, it was always reckon'd famous, Not Verdigris is greener than this verdant spot of Greece, sir. Whose people worship Pan and piping, poetry and peace, sir, Row, Row, Row, never was there heard in it a Row, Row, Row. A little while they yet will smile and dance to pipes and tabors, But soon they'll be for blowing up and banging all their neighbours; Free trade in sheep's eyes ruin will all true home-made affection, And unprotected females clamour loudly for protection. Row, Row, Row, won't they make about it a fine Row, Row, Row. Now after pretty Sylvia we shall running every fellow see, Each shepherd will be mad with love, each shepherdess with jealousy; For in her nosegay vengeance popped a magical anemone Which will turn into a bear garden this model Agapemone. Row, Row, Row, what a shame to make in it a Row, Row, Row. That spirits should be in the world so very bad and frantic, To rise and revolutionise a region so romantic, And drive the Sovereign Lady of this land of love and lamb, sir, To say for all her loyal flock, she doesn't care a—Ram, sir. Row, Row, Row, what a sin to make herein a Row, Row, Row. (Exit)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. —Sylvan Landscape. Enter Phœbe and Daphne. Phœ. What, to be thus deserted by all the village beaux, And see them flirting with another, just beneath my nose; I can't bear it, and I won't—so it don't signify talking, Out of Arcadia, somehow, soon the gipsy I'll be walking. Daph. Yet, in justice to poor Sylvia, the rival you complain of, You'll own she never yet returned the love a single swain of. She cannot help their loving her. Phœ. No more than I can hating A wench whom all the shepherds find so vastly captivating! Daph. Not all—my Damon's true to me as ever! Phœ. Or you'd be just as savage. Daph. Dear—no—never! Linco. sings without. Care flies from the lad that is merry, Whose heart is as sound, And cheeks are as round, As round and as red as a cherry. Daph. But here comes Linco, who makes game of everything romantic, And pokes his fun at love-sick souls, until he drives them frantic. On you, in such a mood, he's sure his mockery to vent all— So do, my dear, just try and sink the sentimental. Enter Linco. Lin. What, my girls of ten thousand! I was, but this moment, Cupid defying, And here are you two, sent in the nick, my courage to be trying; But I'm above temptation—or, if you please, below it. When the boy in the buff jerkin aims at me, I just say, “go it!” And down I duck, and over me the harmless arrow goes fleeting, And you never saw an archer look so ridiculous, even at an archery meeting. (sings) Air—Linco. I laugh and I sing, I am blithsome and free, The rogue's little sting, It can never reach me. With a fal la la la. My skin is so tough, Or so blinking is he, He can't pierce my buff, Or he misses poor me. With a fal la la la. Phœ. Ever thus, Linco, flaunting at love as few do. Lin. Why, gad-a-mercy, girls, would you have me do as you do? Walk with my arms across, amongst the willows heighoing, You'll never catch a shepherd so—I thought you much more knowing. (sings) Oh! never be dull, By the sad willow tree; Of mirth be brimful, And run over like me. With a fal la la la. Why don't you copy Sylvia, who cares a pin for none of 'em, And, as a matter of course, is followed by every one of them. Daph. Nay, don't imagine, I beg, that I sigh the hours away so; I am as happy as Phœbe is wretched. Lin. You don't say so! Good lack, I'm sorry for it. Daph. Sorry that I am happy? Lin. Oh! no! prodigious glad! Phœ. That I am wretched, Sappy! Lin. No! no! prodigious sorry for that, and prodigious glad of the other! Daph. Out on thee! scoffer, away! Phœ. With vexation I shall smother! Daph. Nay, for my part I care not! for no man's loss would I cry, Lin. Well said! Then Sylvia may take your shepherd without a sigh! Daph, My shepherd! what means the fool? Phœ. Her shepherd! oh! prithee tell us! Lin. Nay, nothing which could make so sage a damsel jealous, But some one I saw with Sylvia this morning, and betwixt you and me and the post, I heartily hope it was Damon! for, if not, it must have been his ghost. Daph. My Damon? Lin. Your Damon that was, and Sylvia's Damon that would be If she had no objection. Daph, Oh! the wretch! if it should be! Phœ. Her Damon, as false as the rest! I declare it's delightful! Daph. Oh! you can laugh now, can you? I hate folks who are so spiteful! Phœ. Yet, in justice to poor Sylvia, as you observed so lately, She cannot help his loving her. Daph. The case is altered greatly, Couldn't she be content to carry her vile game on With every other swain, except my Damon! I'll have vengeance on the minx—to justice I'll denounce her, My old lover, Squire Dorus, he shall quickly trounce her. (Exit) Phœ. Well, really, when one's heart is breaking with vexation, To see one's friend in the same distress, is a wond'rous consolation! (Exit) Lin. Ha! ha! ha! upon Miss Daphne I turned the tables rarely, I never throw a chance away of paying the sex off fairly; Oh! that sensible men should be led by the nose, in downright donkey fashion, By what the poets have been pleased to call “the tender passion!” Why “tender” I could never guess—except it be that oft folks Who tumble into it turn out particularly soft folks; Here comes the girl who's set the shepherds all a-madding. What can they see that after her they should be ever gadding? Enter Iphigenia, with Cymon's bouquet. Iph. The more I look upon this sweet bouquet, The more I feel love's power. Lin. Holloa! heyday! What's happened to me, in the name of wonder? I never felt so odd before—some spell I'm surely under. I long to speak to her, yet scarcely dare. Iph. I wander pensive, without knowing where; I speak—not knowing what—to whom—or why! And see but Cymon—but for Cymon sigh! Air—Iphigenia. Oh! why should we sorrow, if Love be no sin? Let smiles of content shew our rapture within: This love has so rais'd me, I now tread in air! He's sure sent from heav'n to lighten my care! Each shepherdess views me with scorn and disdain; Each shepherd pursues me, but all is in vain: No more will I sorrow, no longer despair, He's sure sent from heaven to lighten my care! Lin. (advancing) Sylvia! sweet Sylvia! Iph. (aside) Linco! and so near me! Oh! lud! I hope he didn't overhear me! Lin. Pity me, most enchanting shepherdess. Iph. What is the matter? Lin. I'm afraid to guess! But I've a sort of horrible suspicion, That I shall die, if you're not my physician. Iph. Die? of what, shepherd? Lin. Love! Iph. For whom? Lin. For you! Iph. Love!—nonsense, Linco! Lin. Once I thought so too— But now—I don't know whether it's the weather— Or you—or what—but I feel altogether Transformed!—oh! give me hope! Iph. (aside) Like all the rest! And Linco, who at love so used to jest! Lin. You will—you do—say not that you're engaged! Iph. (aside) If I do say so he'll be quite enraged! Ah! by good luck, here comes my poor old mother! She's deaf with one ear, and can't hear with t'other. (aloud) Linco, for answer I can but refer You to my mother. Lin. May I speak to her? Iph. You may. Lin. And if my suit she kindly hear— Iph. (aside) 'Twill be what she's not done for many a year. Lin. You will consent? Iph. I cannot answer flat— But nothing would surprise me after that. Enter Dorcas. Trio—Dorcas, Linco, and Iphigenia—Bishop. Dorc. Full of doubt and full of fear, Sylvia, I have hobbled here; Tell me, dearest daughter, pray, Where have you been all the day? Iph. Dearest mother, lend an ear. (aside) Linco cannot make her hear. Lin. Calm my doubts, and ease my fear— I love her—Goody, do you hear? Sylvia—Goody—do you hear? Dorc. Eh? Iph. Dearest mother— Dorc. Eh? I have been half dead with fright, I thought you'd not come home to-night. Lin. Goody! Dorc. Eh? Lin. Fair Sylvia— Dorc. Eh? Lin. Oh! I give it up, 'tis clear, Thunder couldn't make her hear! Iph. (aside) He will give it up, 'tis clear, Linco cannot make her hear. (Exit Iphigenia) Lin. I give it up—Let's try what signs will do, Dorc. Sylvia—yes, she's gone home, and so will you. No! oh, you're going to dance—well, as you please. Good lad! he asks my blessing on his knees. Thou hast it, Linco. Lin. Oh! it's of no use! Dorc. Thou art an honest lad, Lin. Go to the deuce! (Exit) Dorc. And so respectful; would all were like you; I shouldn't tremble then at seventy-two. Air—Dorcas. When I was young, though now I'm old, The men were kind and true; But now they're grown so false and bold, What can a woman do? Now what can a woman do? For men are truly So unruly, I tremble at seventy-two. When I was fair, though now so so, No hearts were given to rove; Our pulses beat nor fast nor slow, But all was faith and love. Now what can a woman do? For men are truly So unruly, I tremble at seventy-two. (Exit)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Sixth. —The Beechen Shade—Pastoral Procession and Ballet, at the end of which All. Room for his worship! Enter Dorus, meeting Daphne. Daph. Justice, mighty Dorus! Dorus. What's the offence? who brings the case before us? Daph. An' please your worship, I'm the plaintiff. Dorus. Thou! (coming forward) (aside) My worship is pleased very much, I vow! So, so, Miss Daphne—now you need my favour, You'll mend, I hope, towards me, your behaviour. (aloud) Clear the Court, rascals;—Back, you hussies too— It is for me to hear this case—not you! (Crowd retire) Now—we're alone—thy grievance, fair one, say,— And I'll redress it, be it what it may— Provided, always—Ugh! you rose!—you jewel! I am too kind to one who's been so cruel. Daph. Sir, I've no tongue to thank you. Dorus. But you've lips, Sweeter than any flower the wild bee sips! One kiss, you rogue—the law must have its fee! Daph. Oh! la! your honour—should somebody see! Dorus. (kissing her) Rapture! a perfect cordial! speak—command— And I obey—I swear, on this white hand. Song—Dorus. I'm a judge, it is true, and remarkably wise, And great and important my trust is, But I'm also a judge of a pair of fine eyes, And to Beauty delight to do justice. The sword has no edge for the fair who is kind, To her foes alone fatal its thrust is; To glances like those, where's the judge could be blind? They burn holes through the bandage of Justice. Daph. Banish a shepherdess from out this clime, Who has— Dorus. Enough! no matter what's her crime, If she's offended thee, none can be blacker! Her name? Daph. 'Tis Sylvia! Dorus. Off at once I'll pack her! Odd's life! the minx may thank thy moderation, That is content with simple transportation. I would have hanged her for thee! Daph. You're too kind! Dorus. I'll hang her now if thou hast changed thy mind! Daph. No! only rid me of the creature's sight. Dorus. She sails for Botany Bay this very night! For her arrest, I'll go make out the warrant. Daph. Behold! where yonder trips the wench abhorrent! Dorus. What ho! you scoundrels (to Servants), seize that girl there,—stop her! (Exeunt Servants) To make all safe, in jail at once I'll pop her. (Daphne retires, as Sylvia is brought on by the Justice's Servants) Stand forward, prisoner! Syl. Prisoner! Mercy!—me! What have I done? Dorus. Done—you've done—let me see— Ahem! ahem! by Jove, she's wondrous pretty! Syl. I have done nothing wrong, sir. Dorus. More's the pity— For you stand charged with—Zooks, I melt apace! If innocent, just look me in the face! Syl. I am, I'm sure— Dorus. She takes away my breath. Guilty!—of murder! Syl. Murder! Dorus. Yes! there's death In every glance—thy crime's at least manslaughter! Hang her! Sooner myself I'd hang, draw, quarter. No, not myself! of course I wouldn't swing go, But any other rascal should, by Jingo! Fairer than Daphne, fifty times is she! Transport her! Zooks! she has transported me! Syl. Indeed, I know not how I have offended. Dorus. Thou art too handsome—thy fault can't be mended. Air—Iphigenia. From duty if the shepherd stray, And leave his flocks to feed, The wolf will seize the harmless prey, And innocence will bleed. In me a harmless lamb behold, Oppress'd with every fear, Then guard, good shepherd, guard the fold, For wicked, wicked wolves are near. Dorus. I'll guard and fold thee, lambkin, never fear! The arms of justice shall defend thee, dear! (embracing her) Re-enter Daphne. Daph. So! so! your worship taking such a tender Farewell before to Botany Bay you send her? Dorus. How now!—this insolence! Syl. (to Dorus) In you my trust is. Dorus. (to Daphne) How dare you interrupt the course of justice! Daph. Justice, forsooth! Dorus. Don't make at me your mocks! Another word, I'll clap thee in the stocks! Get thee gone, hussy. (Exit Daphne) (to Iphigenia) Dry thy darling eyes, There's not a drop but as a pearl I prize! Where dost thou dwell? Syl. With Dorcas, in the wood— She is my mother! Dorus. Old deaf Drocas—good! I'll call and see thee, sweet one, soon—to-morrow— Perhaps to-night. Away with fear and sorrow! The Court shall take thee under its protection. Who shall accuse the judge of mis-direction? Daphne's non-suited—she to feed a grudge meant; None who behold thee can dispute my judgment. Song—Dorus. What exquisite pleasure! This sweet treasure From me they shall never, Never sever. My lambkin! my poppet! With thee I could hop it, And frisk it for ever and ever! (Exeunt Dorus and Sylvia separately) Enter Fatima. Fat. A mighty pretty errand, this, that I'm on! I had almost lost sight of Master Cymon. But there he runs; what is it that he sees? A shepherdess, of course, beneath those trees! As I suspected—closer let me creep, 'Till at the wench's face, I get a peep. Merlin appears. Mer. (aside) For peeping, I'll take care that you shall pay. Fat. To save me trouble, they have turned this way. Upon my word, his choice is not so bad! I must confess there's some taste in the lad. She'll strike a panic to my lady's heart! Mer. (aside) I'll make yours quake a little ere we part! Fat. My tablets—that I may no trait omit, A lovely figure—like my own—a bit; (writes) Beautiful eyes—amazingly like mine, (writes) A smile!—that's positively quite divine! Who can she be? Would I could conjure now! Mer. (aside) I'll conjure for you! (waves his wand over the tablets) Fat. Ugh! what's this? I vow The letters have all turned as red as blood! And not my writing, either! oh! oh! lud! (reads) “Merlin, the wizard, here from Cyprus brought her— “She is the Prince of Famagosta's daughter; “Her name—Iphigenia!”—Merlin! murder! A princess, too!—I can't read any furder! The writing fades—I'm sinking in my shoes! Oh! for my mistress here is precious news! Mer. (advancing) For which to my politeness you're indebted! Fat. (aside) The old Welsh goat himself! I could have betted A crown of it!—I'm dead as a Welsh rabbit! Mer. Listen! Fat. I will, great sir, it is my habit— I may indeed say it is my vocation, In chambermaids a chief qualification. Mer. Peace! A great service I'm about to do you. Fat. 'Twill be the first, I'm sure then, since I knew you. Mer. You talk too much, Fat. Good gracious me!—talk! I— Mer. Silence! hear me!—I do not need reply. You're at this moment dying to go chatter To your false mistress all about this matter. Fat. I won't indeed—if you don't think it proper. Mer. You shan't—upon your tongue, I'll put a stopper. Fat. A stopper on my tongue! Oh! I conjure ye— Will nothing else appease your awful fury? Mer. Nothing! Fat. Of comfort leave me but a crumb! Make me lame, deaf, blind—anything but dumb! Mer. You won't be dumb—you'll have two words to say. Fat. Two! only two!—oh! mercy, which be they? Mer. Two of the shortest—very useful though— You'll have the power of saying “yes,” or “no!” 'Tis done!—in vain you even try to stutter! (touches her with his wand) But “yes,” or “no,” those wicked lips can utter! But “yes,” or “no,” those wicked fingers write, Until Urganda's power ceases quite! Thou'rt now a woman at a fair to show— Dost mark me? Fat. Yes. Mer. And art thou grateful? Fat. No. Mer. Beware! thy power of speech may still be less! Shall I reduce it? (threatening her) Fat. No! (frightened) Mer. Begone, then! Fat. Yes! (runs off) Mer. A fitting punishment for her offence, Who'd play the spy on love and innocence— To such a woman 'tis the worst of woes, Not to be able to tell all she knows. (Exit) Enter Cymon and Iphigenia. Cym. My transformation I can scarce believe, And know not whether to rejoice or grieve! At the vast change my raptur'd soul expanding. Thou'st given me eyes, and ears, and understanding; Whilst I possess them, I must be all thine, Iph. It is love's work—as great a change is mine! Enter Dorus, Daphne, Damon, Dorilas, Phœbe, and Shepherds. Daph. (to Dorus) What say you now, sir, to your nymph immaculate? Dorus. I'm choked with rage! no more can I ejaculate! Dam. So, Mistress Icicle, your humble servant! Dori. Was't for this clown you scorn'd our passion fervent? Phœ. Fine doings here, indeed! Daph. Past all endurance! I'm quite astounded at the slut's assurance! Phœ. Why don't you speak? Daph. Does shame your vile tongue fetter? Cym. We feel but shame for those who should know better. Dorus. Who art thou? speak, this instant! I command, sir. Cym. Cymon. Dam. The greatest fool in all the land, sir! Cym. The greatest fool! good manners, pink of peasants, You surely have forgot—his worship's presence! Dorus. The rascal knows me! Cym. Well—by reputation— As you perceive— Dorus. The fact's an aggravation! I'll make thee know me better! Cym. A good movement— There's room enough, I'm certain, for improvement. You are placed here to make the law respected, And see the innocent from harm protected; But, slave of passion which your age should smother, Disgrace the one, and persecute the other! Dorus. He can't be the young fool of whom they told one. Cym. I am—as sure as you're the wicked old one! Dorus. 'Slife! I'll no longer stand this sort of fun! Seize him! Cym. Perhaps that's sooner said than done! (places himself before Sylvia) Dorus. Fall on him—but don't kill him! mark our dread will! We'll have him work his life out on the treadmill! Cym. Love gives me courage! nerved by Sylvia's charms, I feel a man, and not a child in arms! Air—Cymon. Come on, come on, A thousand to one; I dare you to come on. Though unpractis'd and young, Love has made me stout and strong, Has given me a charm, Will not suffer me to fall; Has steel'd my heart, and nerv'd my arm, To guard my precious all, Come on, come on, &amp;c. Shepherds attack Cymon—he defends himself with his staff, and beats them off) Dorus. Now, wenches, now! whilst him they tackle, we can Seize on the baggage—she can't fight, if he can! Dorus and Shepherdesses seize Iphigenia) Daph. Drag her before our mighty Queen Urganda! Phœ. Yes, to her mercies over we will hand her. Iph. Help! Cymon! help! Dorus. Nay, it's no use your squalling! I'll teach you both to come here caterwauling! (Exeunt with Iphigenia) Enter Damon, Dorilas, and Shepherds, running. Dam. Confound the chap! he lays about him purely! Dori. He's cracked my crown! Shep. The deuce is in him surely! Dam. Your head or shins you can't tell which to mind most! Shep. He's coming. Dori. Then the devil take the hindmost! (they run off) Enter Cymon. Cym. I've conquered! Sylvia! answer to my call! My love! my life! my valour! and my all! Where art thou? gone! break, heart, of joy so late full! For victory is vain, and life is hateful! Air—Cymon. Torn from me, torn from me; which way did they take her? To death they shall bear me, To pieces shall tear me, Before I'll forsake her! Though fast bound in a spell, By Urganda so fell, I'll burst through their charms, Seize my fair in my arms; Then my valour shall prove, No magic like virtue, like virtue and love! Enter April and meets Cymon. Apr. Stop! Cym. Never! Apr. Not of Sylvia to hear news? Cym. Ah! Apr. You find that's another pair of shoes. Cym. Where is she? Apr. Gone! Cym. I know that, fool! but whither? Apr. To Paphos! Cym. Where's that? How shall I go thither? Apr. Paphos is in the Isle of Cyprus, where Love has a flower show, and fancy fair! Cym. Shew me the way to Love, I do implore! Apr. Come. Folly's often shewn the way before. (Exeunt)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Seventh. —Chamber in Urganda's Palace. Enter Urganda and Fatima. Urg. Yes!—no!—forbear to answer in this fashion! I cannot brook such trifling with my passion! Why don't you speak? can you not answer? Fat. Yes! Urg. Go on then, Fat. No! Urg. What does the girl possess? In one word, trait'ress, hast thou seen my foe? Fat. Yes! Urg. Ha! her name, this instant, woman! Fat. No! Urg. No! dost not fear my rage? Fat. Yes! Urg. Quickly tell Her name, then! Fat. No! Urg. Art thou beneath some spell? Fat. Yes! yes! Urg. 'Tis Merlin! Fat. Yes! Urg. Too true my guess! My rival—is she very handsome? Fat. Yes. Urg. How handsome? handsomer than I or you? Fat. Yes! no! Urg. Away! you torture me—you do! Since so imperfectly you can but speak, Be dumb completely! (Fatima makes a movement of horror and rage, but cannot utter a sound) Oh! where shall I seek For consolation this vile earth above, Foiled as I am in vengeance and in love! Enter Dorus. How now! who breaks in thus, on my despair? By all the fiends, my misery thou shalt share! Dorus. Mercy! most mighty and malignant Queen! No!—mighty and magnanimous, I mean! Ascribe it not, I pray, to my audacity, I come in my official capacity, My duty as a loyal magistrate— We've seized a traitor to your royal state. Urg. Cymon! Dorus. Not Cymon—for a cogent reason— But an accomplice in the act of treason. A girl, named Sylvia. Urg. Sylvia! Ha! is she The Creature!— (to Fatima, who makes signs, she cannot speak at all) Pshaw—no matter—let me see! This Sylvia. Dorus. Forward with the culprit there! Enter Daphne and Phœbe with Sylvia. Urg. Yes, yes! I feel it is the fatal fair! The cause of all my woe! Confess thou art The wretched girl who stole my Cymon's heart? Syl. I am the happy maid beloved by Cymon. Dorus. The hardened hussy doats her horrid crime on! What punishment is such offence awaiting? Something exceedingly excruciating! The rack—or, perhaps, breaking on the wheel! Urg. No! she shall live worse tortures still to feel, Such as Urganda's heart e'en now devour! Come, Demon of Despair! in thy black tower— April appears. Apr. Black tower!—Pooh, pooh! I hate all dismal scenes. Urg. Thou'rt not Despair! Apr. I don't know what it means. Thro' storm and shine I gaily drive my tandem, My motto ever was, “Nil Desperandum!” However dull before—when I appear, I usually see smiles through every tier. D'ye think I'd stand Despair's eternal drizzle? No! let mirth reign, and melancholy mizzle, April the First is now Lord of Misrule. Urg. Then I am nothing! Apr. Yes, an April Fool; Don't be offended—peep fool at your brothers; Would in the world we ne'er saw any others. But while poor April Fools one day appear, More solemn blockheads lord it through the year. If any such be here—for mercy's sake, From a poor fool a word of wisdom take! Never look grave when honest hearts are gay, And keep for Folly only All-fools'-day. The scene changes to the Bower of Paphos, the Abode of Love among the Roses—Cymon discovered in centre—Enter Merlin, with all the Shepherds and Shepherdesses. Song—April—Tully. When a dame will hunting go With two strings to her bow, She finds them very often like two stools; And if one fine morning seen Flopped upon the ground between, Gets laughed at worse than simple April Fools. The Justice, who looks big, With his wisdom, in his wig, And is ever by his passions made a tool; If any such there be, Let me ask you, isn't he A great deal worse than any April Fool? Would that ev'ry meddling jade, Who of mischief makes a trade, And whose tongue no mortal power could ever rule— Could, when all agog to chatter, And her betters to bespatter, Be dumb-founded, like this busy April Fool. The boy, at the first blush, Who would into wedlock rush, With a girl, perhaps, but yesterday at school; Never heeding that to “Matrimony” Prudence would rhyme “Patrimony,” May wish he'd only been an April Fool. So, now, we'll ask young Hymen, To splice Iphigene and Cymon, According to the good old-fashioned rules; And trust our calculation, On your usual approbation, Will not prove us all-together April Fools.
