      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Public Walk in Jerusalem. A Pharisee is on his knees praying aloud at the corner of a street. A crowd gathered round. Phar. Not that the hand of man can be raised up, Except as pre-ordained; not that one pulse Can beat beyond the circle of its law, One thought be called our own; but that our souls Must struggle virtuously for virtue's sake, Setting down all we gain as merely given, Since God ordains free-will as part of fate. Holy! thrice holy Law of Ancient Days! Immortal life in ever-changing shapes To some of us is promisedâsuch as keep The old traditions like a mirror bright, Wherein we see the doctrines, rules, and forms, And mystic truths, the which, if read aright, Crown with pure sanctity the prostrate mind. [Falls on his face. [Exeunt crowd with murmurs of applause. Enter a Scribe; and a Pharisee dressed in sack-cloth, with fine linen underneath. Scribe. Our teachingâall!âopposing all our teaching! 2nd Phar. And our high doctrine. 1st Phar. (Rising.) Speak ye not of Jesus? 2nd Phar. Of him, beyond all men who yet have raised Schisms, and false doctrines, and by arts misled The ignorant peopleâthe ungrateful blind ones, Fond of wild parables flattering to their hopes And laxity of life. Scribe. Reproved by us In schools, and synagogues, and lecture halls, Whene'er we teach; also reproved and warned In all our books and writingsâbut in vain; Him they still follow. 1st Phar. I will pray against him In all the public places, and denounce His blasphemies against the ancient laws, And our interpretation. Scribe. Lo! where comes One of his followers! 2nd Phar. A man whose face Is full of prideâlacking all reverence. (Aside.) I fain would tread him down. Enter Judas. Scribe. He is well known. 1st Phar. (To Judas.) How cometh it to pass that thou walkest abroad among holy men, and virtuous people who obey the law and its expounders,â thou thyself being a follower of false prophets, and a believer of heresies and lies? Scribe. Dost thou also presume to teach, being thyself untaught in all things but devilishness and the hopes of fools! 2nd Phar. Thou bearest the face of one who hath some cause for pride; and yet thou art the slave of a blasphemer. Judas. Rabbi, this is not so. I follow no heretic, but one who hath a divine faith, and who teacheth it; who hath no devils, but is a caster out of devils from others; neither is he a fool, but rather a teacher of heavenly wisdom. Wherefore he is no blasphemer, neither have I cause for shame in the face that I follow him. Pride rather, in the hope of things which are to come. [The Scribe and Pharisees confer apart. Scribe. He saith what he must say, being a servant of this impostor. 1st Phar. The pomegranate seed telleth what tree it fell from; for it is like unto none other seed; so doth this man betray his master's preaching. 2nd Phar. (Loudly.) He hath likewise an evil spirit and a proud, of his own nature; else would he show reverence in high places, and in due season. Judas. Masters, this do I constantly, though not here. 2nd Phar. Where dost thou show reverence; before whom, and in what places? Judas. In the presence of my Lord and Master Jesus, who is Christ, and in the Temple of the True Spirit. Scribe. Which temple callest thou the Temple of the True Spirit?âis not the great Temple of Jerusalem the temple of the True Spirit? 1st Phar. Is it not? Scribe. (Aside to Pharisees.) Let beâlet beânow will he utter blasphemy and so become amenable to death by the law. Judas. All temples are of the True Spirit wherein the truth is taught; and wheresoever Christ teacheth, there will ye find the temple of the True Spirit. Scribe. He answereth cunningly, and by his lesson. Judas. (Aside.) And it shall have dominion over all the earth! 1st Phar. Tell us now, and speak no longer with a double tongue, wherefore followest thou this man Jesus? The motives of his preaching, what are they but the zeal of one who seeks to climb to a high place, perhaps to the highest place, even to that of the High Priest of Jerusalem. Scribe. Or being mad, perchance he would be a High Priest over all other High Priests. 2nd Phar. Aspiring, moreover, in the summit of that madness, to the throne of Judea. 1st Phar. Thereto he leadeth an ungodly and a vicious life, consorting with publicans and sinners, profaning the sabbath with work, and declaring to women of vicious courses that their sins are forgiven them. Scribe. In secret he doeth many evil things. He is followed by divers women, and by two or three in especial. Judas. Openly; and in secret doth he nothing. This ye know very well. 1st Phar. We know it not as ye say. We believe otherwise than ye say. Scribe. Behold the story this carpenter's son telleth of his miraculous birth, whereby he seeketh to hide the wickedness of her that bare him. Of his carpenter father never maketh he mention, as though he knew not the man, but exalteth himself into the Son of God in a diviner sense than any of us are sons of God! 1st Phar. What manner of man is he who uttereth blasphemies like these, and yet prevaileth over a multitude, so that they kneel down and bless his feet, and follow him whithersoever he listeth? Judas. They follow him because they believe in him; and desert the teaching of the Scribes, and the austere hypocrisy of the Pharisees, because they know there is no truth in your hearts. Wherefore do his followers multiply daily, while yours decrease. 1st Phar. This folly runs too fast. It must be stopped. Judas. (Aside.) Too fast!âoh far too patiently and slow, else would none dare utter these things. 1st Phar. The blossoms of the fig are secret and hidden from the light, and evil thoughts ripen in darkness. 2nd Phar. Thou hast speedily answered all our accusations that were in the lesson thou hast been taught, but when we tell thee him thou followest goeth too fast, and must come to his end, then speakest thou nought. Scribe. His miracles, also, and the cures that he hath wrought, what are they? 1st Phar. Are they not the work of an unclean spirit? âof devils, which defile us even in the hearing of their deeds? 2nd Phar. Let us to the bathsâlet us wash ourselves and purify ourselves from all this wickedness. [Exeunt Pharisees. Judas. (Aside.) I would that Jesus could feel these taunts even as I feel them, then would he command Beelzebub with a legion of devils to seek abode in these men's breasts, and with the struggle for more space wherein to curse and to destroy, thereby torment them terribly, and urge them to and fro as with a fiery wind pent up. I would he did this at once, and so enforced their belief in his power, and in his mission upon earth. Scribe. Thou reasonest Judas upon our words, and taking counsel with thyself, peradventure dost repent thee. Wilt thou have wisdom, and wilt thou do a righteous act? Judas. What act? Scribe. It were a virtuous thing to give this impostor into the hands of the law. Verily, the reward would be forthcoming. Judas. Go thy ways. I took thee for a buyer and seller of lies, and am not deceived. Scribe. Art thou not that Judas who beareth the bag of coin for Jesus and his followers; the treasurer of the son of a Nazarene carpenter, yea and of his fishermen? Art thou not he who putteth his private hand into the common purse whensoever the vice of thy blood calleth for food?âand now dost thou seek to look virtuous, and take pride in an honest palm? Verily thou art a weak knave who followeth the footsteps of one who is mad with his own folly. [Exit Scribe. Judas. Would I were Christ!âor that the power he holds So placidly, were given to my hand For one short hour! Why moveth not his work More rapidly and widely, since the time Crieth aloud for it, and Misery sits Wringing her hands at poor men's doors? The people Oppressed by priests, and pharisees, and scribes, Grievously hate them, and desert their teaching To follow Jesus; yet he slowly walks In dangerous places where we may be stoned, Scourged, crucified, imprisoned, slain by the sword, While meekly he pursueth still his way, Secure, by reason of the Spirit of God Which ever dwelleth in him. Martyrdom Walks always by our side, sits by our bed, And smileth on our hunger and scant robes. But, if escaping, are we to grow old In houseless journeys, toil, and penury; Jeer'd, scoff'd at, and reviled from manhood's prime Till our white beards touch close upon the grave, And we drop in unhonoured? All the signs And tokens of a season ripe for change, Greater than man e'er dreamed of, fill the sky, And the earth mutters underneath my feet â'Tis time! 'tis time!â The overthrow and scattering Of the old thrones, temples, and synagogues, Halls of injustice, schools of ignorant scribes, And palaces of pharisaic pride, Whose owners preach humilityâall hang Upon the breath of Jesus. He passeth on Teaching and healing, nor can I discern One smile of secret consciousness that soon All this shall endâand his true kingdom, come. Somewhat he lacketh. He is great of soul, Filled with divine power, but too angel-sweet For turbulent earth and its gross exigencies; Strong in design, and magnanimity, Forbearance, fortitude, and lovingness, He lacketh still the vehement kingly willâ Will, bred of earth and all that it inheritsâ To seize the mountain by its forest hair And whirl it into dust. On that soft plain, The Temple of his Fatherâthe true Spiritâ Straightway might we erect, and not lie hid In secret places, like forlorn wild beasts Who dread the hunter's spear. Why doth he wait? Would he were seized!âcondemned to instant deathâ Set on a brink, and all his hopes for man Endangered by his fallâtill these extremes Drew violent lightning from him!â How, if this Were brought about?âThe means, like portals wide Are open. But the vacant passage teems! And as I look on itâslowly there rise Pale Forms, that gaze around! They do not see me, But only see the deed that's in my thought. I will pass through ye, Ghosts! They fade away. (He pauses.) Were't good with Jesus' followers I took counsel? A strong deed prospereth best in company, If all agree;âsecurest done alone. [Exit. SCENE II. The Chamber of the High Priest in the Temple of Jerusalem. Caiaphas, the High Priest, seated in his chair, discoursing with Priests and Elders, seated on the marble floor. Nicodemus reclines thoughtfully on one side. Caia. And from this city where we preach, and rule, Yea, from the highest altar, do they flock; From IdumÃ¦a, and beyond the banks Of Jordan, flock they, and from Galileeâ From Dan to Beersheba! 1st Priest. Of a verity Their reason hath departed. Caia. Multitudes From Tyre and Sidon like great floods pour down To hear him preach! 1st Elder. The arch-impostor Jesus Hath also wrought strange cures. Caia. Praying and teaching! And followed for these things, as though pure oil, Honey, and wine, and spices, came alone From rocky Nazareth! Out of barrenness Unnatural fires are kindled in their minds. 2nd Elder. Great miracles too! Caia. Deceptions of the eye! Nico. Truly he looketh with a wondrous look Whose quietness is like unto a lake Of unknown depth, which lieth in the shade, Yet hath a gleam as from some hidden light. Caia. Not of his look I spake, but of the eye Of dazzled multitudes, who thought they saw Thousands of loaves and fishes. Nico. Also thought That they did eat thereof. Caia. As men in dreams, Or with confounded senses, objects see, Colours and forms which are not, and can taste Water as wine;âbut these things have an end. 1st Priest. And this were good. 2nd Priest. Would it were come! Nico. How end? Caia. How, but with death! Already have we sent To lay hands on him. Nico. Have a care in this: The people love him with exceeding love. Caia. And others are suspectedâmen of noteâ Who follow him in secret. 1st Priest. He hath lures For every sort of birdâbaits for all fish. 1st Elder. Therefore take counsel with your officers That they act prudently. Enter Scribe and Two Pharisees. 1st Phar. O, Caiaphas! Hear a new miracle. The dead hath risen Againâwith wonders greater than before! Caia. Where? 1st Priest. Who hath wrought this? 1st Phar. Lazarus, who was dead, After four days' entombmentâyea, 'tis trueâ Hath come to life, and in his grave-clothes prayed In silenceâlifting up his corded hands! Scribe. Rabbi, it is not lawful. Caia. Who hath done this? 1st Phar. Jesus! (Priests and Elders murmur.) 2nd Phar. But the officers and men we sent To seize, or slay him, may have proved their worth; And all his dealings with the other world Will trouble us no more. Scribe. The fishermenâ Sinners and publicansâloose womenâchildrenâ And all the multitudes who left the schools Of Hillel and Schammai, halls, synagogues, Even to the Rabboni turning a deaf ear, Will then come back each to his proper house; And wisdom, learning, law, the priests, and God, Again find reverence. Enter a Centurion and two other Officers. 1st Priest. Lo! our officers! 1st Phar. Are these the rough men who went forth in steel, Spears in their hands, and with a savage joy To do our bidding? 2nd Priest. Come ye thus alone? Nico. Something hath moved them. Caia. Why have ye not brought him? Centur. Never man spake like this man. 1st Offi. We stood with the rest to listen, and the air grew silent before his words. Our spears slipped through our hands upon the ground; our swords were as shadows upon the wall. Centur. When he approached us, we stood aside to let him pass, and no one dared lay hands upon him. Caia. Are ye also deceived! Scribe. Behold the ignorance of these fellows, how it maketh their knees tremble. 2nd Phar. Have any of the rulers, or of the pharisees believed in his teaching and his miracles? Scribe. Verily this people who knoweth not the law, is cursed. And Jesus is he who leadeth them astray from it. Nico. Doth our law judge any man before it hear him, and know what he doeth? Caia. (Rising.) Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look, for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet! [Exeunt all but Caiaphas, Priests, and Pharisees. 1st Priest. Truly these things are very strange. 2nd Priest. And besides, damnable. He saith that he is the Son of God, which we know to be false; and he also saith that he is the Son of Man, which we may well doubt, for the acts which he doeth are like unto the works of a child of Beelzebub. 1st Phar. He doeth what he listeth, and all the people who come near him believe in him. 2nd Priest. Yea, even the Pharisee Nicodemus believeth in him. 1st Priest. Our officers and soldiers stand aside to let him pass, bowing their heads to the ground when they should raise their hands to smite him down; and peradventure some of the scribes and elders shall soon come to hearken unto his preaching. Caia. All they who hearken to it are accursed. Have a care. I know a Levite, a rich man of Bethoran, who in his youth was a singer in the tabernacle, and afterwards a player upon the ten-stringed oshur; and now he is a follower of Jesus! Wherefore may everlasting fires sing and roar around him, and his ears hear the cries of many demons cursing him evermore. Let all who have held offices in the temple or the tabernacle take heedâyea, let them be exceeding watchful that their feet trip not. 2nd Priest. But the officers and soldiers, O Caiaphas, were men of weak mind. 1st Phar. Unlike unto those who have walked in sacred places and been accustomed to hear the ancient law of Moses and the Prophets. 1st Priest. And the Levite of Bethoran was as one who is deaf; wherefore his ears received no wisdom in his youth. 2nd Priest. Some other means must be devised whereby Jesus shall be stopped in his preaching. 2nd Phar. If we let him alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. Caia. Ye know nothing at all; nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. 2nd Priest. Thou sayest wisely, O Caiaphas; there is nothing but his death that shall serve us. 1st Priest. And peradventure this righteous suggestion shall be accounted a prophecy by the nations who live after us. Caia. I would that it were so; but the sword lingereth. Enter Judas. 1st Priest. Thou also art one of those who follow Jesus; and comest thou here before the High Priest! 2nd Priest. To kneel and to repent thee of thy back-sliding art thou here, else were thy life in much peril. Judas. I would seek the High Priest, having a troubled mind. Caia. Speak, for there is mercy in the great temple to such as repent them truly. Judas. I have bethought meâ[he hesitates] and in the night have I resolved to do it. Caia. On what hast thou resolved? Judas. (Hesitating.) Concerning that which I had thought. Caia. Hast thou left the teaching of Jesus? Judas. I have left him. 1st Priest. Peradventure thou comest here to hearken unto the words of the High Priest, and how he teacheth? 2nd Priest. And to note the difference between the twainâyea between the High Priest, in his chamber, and the homeless Nazarene. (Judas maketh a sign of assent.) 3rd Priest. Verily thou dost well in this. [Judas turneth aside, resting his head in his hands. Caia. It is not the season, Judas, to speak with thee of divine things,âof things derived from our holy law and prophets, seeing thou art as one newly come into the world, with a spirit all unused to righteousness, and with feet that have not trod in sacred places. 2nd Priest. And worse than this, thy spirit hath hearkened unto the councils of devils, and thy feet have followed in their track. Caia. (To Priest.) Let be. (To Judas.) Somewhat, however, art thou capable of understanding; and of earthly things, therefore, must thou first hear from the elders and scribes; for though the scribes sit in Moses' seat, yet do they look down compassionately upon such as need human knowledge, and the sciences thereof. 1st Priest. And they will teach thee with true words. Caia. The mighty plain, and the rough level of the earth we inhabit, this shalt thou learn, and also of the waters which flow all round about it, wherein it floateth, and of the clouds and heavens which enclose the waters. And your heart shall treasure up these words. 2nd Priest. (In a low voice.) And your heart shall treasure up these words. Judas. (Aside.) Shall I turn back now that I am so far? Caia. Of the heavens themselves,âthe great sun that rolleth round about the earth; and the moon, which is of like size and distance, but of like shape once only in her period, and then dwindleth away even unto an harvest sickle, which is understood by the records; and of the multitudes of stars, which are marvellous in their ways, and the slowness of their growth,âall this shalt thou be taught. Priests. (In a low tone.) And your heart shall treasure up these words. Caia. Of the boundaries of the earth shalt thou hear, and of foreign countries, yea from Sephar to Ophir, from the rocks of Caucasus, and from the lands beyond Tarshish which are the edges of the earth. Priests. And your heart shall treasure up these words. Caia. Also the arts of trading and of commerce mayst thou be taught; and warned in good season against much dealing with strange people; for that which was wisdom in Solomon, who encouraged this, is no longer held good for the people. Priests. And your heart shall treasure up these words. Caia. Of fishing and of carpentry need I not speak, nor peradventure of agriculture and the tending upon sheep; neither shall I speak of the rocks and metals underneath the earth,âof its sands, and its sparkling darkness many cubits downwards, until arriving on the burning confines of the abyss of hell. But when thou shalt arrive at this knowledge, then shall begin thy instruction in the divine law. Priests. Let your heartâ Judas. (Raising his head.) I come, O Caiaphas, to betray Jesus unto thee, yea to give him into your hands. Caia. It is good. 1st Priest. Thou speakest wisely, and with a repentant heart. 3rd Priest. Thy words, O Caiaphas, have prevailed over him; over the teaching of the Nazarene hast thou prevailed. 2nd Priest. (To Judas.) But is thy repentance true; or dost thou come to act cunningly with us? Caia. Can this be so? 2nd Priest. Wherefore dost thou come to betray Jesus unto punishment? Hath he offended thee? Hath he taken the bag out of thy hands? 1st Priest. Or art thou needy, and seekest thou a reward? Judas. Thou sayest rightly. I would have thirty pieces of silver for my reward. Caia. Let them be counted out before him. His spirit is humbled by my words so that he speaketh with a discreet tongue. [Judas stands aside at one of the windows while the thirty pieces are counted out. Scene closes. SCENE III. The Garden of Gethsemane. Enter Nicodemus and Claudia. Clau. This also have I heard. Nico. A divine man: It is past all doubt. The lame, the blind, the sick, Touch but his garment's hem, and they are healed. Even the dead rise. Clau. And now Lazarus, Who was entombed four days! The Spirit of God Must surely dwell with Jesus. Nico. Old and youngâ All he receiveth. Women in crowds, and children Follow him. Little children in his arms He foldeth up, and blesseth them. Clau. Canst thou bring me Where I may see him? Nico. I will watch a time For this; and speedily, since there is doubt How long he tarry with us. Clau. Thou dost speak Like one who sorroweth. If he depart Out of Jerusalem, he will return After his journey? Nico. He will not return. (Exeunt.) Enter Peter, John, James, and Judas. Peter. If his word move all hearts, where'er he goeth, As doth the sun who looketh on the waves, Call'st thou the light too slow? The divine word He preacheth, and the spirit of his life, Are they not quick to reach large multitudes, Daily? Judas. But since our days are but a span, Or we may suffer death by martyrdom, For us it seemeth slow. John. No time is slow, While love goes with it; wherefore our Lord's good time Let us abide in full faith. James. What are we, That we should question him? Judas. But while his power Could silence their revilings and their taunts, Set aside all their doctrines and harsh laws, Wither their soldiers' handsâcast down their walls, And in the place a mighty Temple erect To the True Spiritâeven to his Father, Godâ Behold, instead, he wandereth by the way, Even as an outcast, and the wicked sit In the high places, as of old. Peter. Nay, Judas; Not as of old, with all the future theirsâ For so it seemedâbut as things doomed to die, Since the bright star of Bethlehem arose. John. Their nights are numbered. Jesus can breathe one breathâ And all who now sit crowned shall fade in air, While from the misty silence, to the sweetness Of psaltery, dulcimer, and angel quire, His own great Kingdom burneth into view! Judas. I say this to myself most constantly! I know thisâthis I strongly feel. John. But when He shall thus breathe his triumph, no man knoweth,â Or it may be that first we must taste death; And therefore should we bear with him the burden Of the wrong-doers and the blind. Judas. My heart Rebels against this sufferingâseeing no end. James. When Jesus rules on earth, all pains will end. John. Lord, I am thine at all times, and my love Being equal to my hope, I wait in peace. Peter. Shall we not meanwhile suffer cheerfully All evils that may come? Judas. What need of evils? Have we not known enough of these already; And why should Jesus suffer them? My blood Leaps up against it. Peter. Thou shouldst rather kneel To Jesus, praying him to grant unto thee The blessing of his patience. John. And the joy, Serene and glorified, which comes to those Who well believing in his future kingdom, On earthâare not unmindful of the grave. [Exeunt Peter, John, and James. Judas. They are deaf. Why not his kingdom now on earth? The grave can better wait than we. [He pauses.] The air grows dark.â[Pauses.] Time trembles in my heart. I have besought them warily, and I find My thought must be my act without their aid, Or counsel.â[Pauses.] Yonder dusky foliage moves! There is no wind. I see the gleam of spears! [Judas makes a sign, and Exit. Enter two Centurions with armed Soldiers. 1st Cen. He signalled us that we should follow him. 2nd Cen. But not too closely. 1st Cen. Saw you not that bird Of evil omen in the gloomy grove? A Sol. Master, this is a bad work. 1st Cen. Follow now. (Exeunt.) Enter Caiaphas and Pontius Pilate. Caia. Thou being a just man, and also of great wisdom, wilt surely consider the acts which he hath committed how worthy they are of punishment at thy hands? Pilate. I cannot rightly know what he hath done till I have heard his accusers set it forth, and all those that come to bear witness against him. Caia. Of these there will be great numbers; but the manifold sins of which he is accused, and the blasphemies he hath spoken, are they not already known to thee? Pilate. I have not heard him blaspheme, nor must I judge any of his sins beforehand, nor in private. Caia. Surely thou wilt condemn this man; or how shall we be safe from others like unto him, and from them that follow him! Pilate. They will all be exposed to the same law, therefore take thou no fear of them. Caia. In all things, O Pilate, doth he interfere with the priests, so that they feel it sorely, and must cry aloud against it; and thou, being a pious man fearing the gods of thy country, wilt assuredly condemn those who make a mockery and scorn of the priests of any holy faith, and its ceremonies, and traditions. Pilate. What hath he done against the Jewish priests? Caia. He hath taught the people that all men are brothers, and should be equal; that no man should be master and rabbi; and that he is greatest who serveth most. What is this but evil speaking and false doctrine, and lying and slandering? For do we not very well know, O Pilate, that the people are not the brothers of those who sit in high places, nor have they any equality except among their fellows who dwell with them. Are there not kings upon the earth, and high priests, and governors of great dignity, and many slaves?âWhy answerest thou not a word? Besides these false doctrines which he teacheth everywhere openly, he hath wrought pretended miracles, or if not pretended he hath had the aid of demons therein; and he hath moreover gone about healing the sick. Lepers, of each of the four kinds,âdemoniacs, men and women sick of fevers, and agues, hath he healed; the blind, the lame, and others suffering palsy and tephelim, and diseases of the reins, or suffering grievously in the liver and spleenânot by anointing with oil according to our sacred use, prescribed by ancient traditions for all these diseases, but by prayer and the laying on of hands! Of a surety thou wilt visit all these acts with their just reward? Pilate. I will see justice done upon him. [Sounds of tumult in a distant part of the garden. Caia. What is it? Pilate. The sentence must await the forms of law. Caia. The tumult that we hear, knowest thou what it means? Pilate. I know not. (Exit Pilate.) Caia. Yet shalt thou condemn him, unless he work a miracle to save himself. (Tumult increases.) The demons that minister unto him are of great strength. Enter Scribe and Two Pharisees followed by James. James. Will ye return to your houses to feast and make merry while this evil is committed? Will no man turn aside to set free the Son of God? Scribe. Ha-ha! doth he need aid, and dost thou ask it of us? 1st Phar. What we do is righteousness, but he hath done and spoken abominations. Caia. If he be the Son of God, let him set himself free. Tumult near at hand. 2nd Phar. They bear him to the house of Annas. If he be as this man sayeth, let him command the house of Annas that it fall down upon the heads of all within, while he cometh out whole. [Exit Caiaphas. James. O, Scribes and Pharisees, boasters and teachers of virtuous things, how full of venom are your hearts! Your words are as the hissing of serpents. Scribe. He hath taught thee that thou shouldst speak slanderously after his own fashion. 2nd Phar. But the tongue of the slanderer shall be silenced. A coal of fire shall be put into his mouth. (Noise of many voices. A crowd passeth over between the trees at the back, with torches and with spears. James. They bear Him away! Scribe. As for thee, return to thy boat which rotteth on the banks of the Galilean sea, and to thy nets which are full of holes. 1st Phar. See here! Enter Judas. Scribe. This fellow had a stiff neck, and yet a pliant ear, so that while he seemed to scorn my words he followed after a wise direction. 1st Phar. (To Judas.) Thou shewest the true spirit of thy master's preaching, having betrayed him to the death of the slave, yea of the vilest thief. 2nd Phar. I have seen the flying-serpent of the wilderness, how he moved upon his belly through the grass; how he darted through the air upon his prey. Scribe. I stood upon an asp, and he turned and stung the Son of God with a venomous tooth. [Exeunt Scribe and Pharisees. James. Thou standest as a tree that the wind rendeth not, but thou art surely rotted at the core because thou hast done this thing. Enter Mary (the Mother of Jesus), Mary (the Sister of Lazarus), Mary Magdalene, and Joseph of Arimathea. M. Magd. (To Judas.) Can the shades of night hide thee; can the thick trees cover thee up, so that our curses reach thee not? S. of Laz. When the moon rises, whither wilt thou flee; when the stars come out, what cavern shall be deep enough for thee? M. Magd. Art thou indeed a man because of thy form; can a beast of the field put on garments, and sit at meat, and have speech, and salute with a kiss? James. Dost thou see this woman, the Mother of our Lord; dost thou look upon her? J. of Ar. He turneth his head aside. He cannot endure her faceâ James. Though her eyes gaze not on him, and her tongue uttereth no word. M. Magd. (To Judas) O that the lightning would run shivering down upon thee!âthat the black clouds would open a deluge over thee! J. of Ar. Let us leave Judas to himself, for there can be nothing more miserable on earth. Even Pity hides her head, and is afraid. And such is his reward. [Exeunt all except Judas. Judas. Wherefore be miserable? Why should I feel Thus heavy and cast down? Reproachful words Were certainânaturalâand they will change To praises and hosannas, when my deed Shall justify itself, and the Messiah, Compelled his power and terrors to reveal, Shall burn to stubble all their armed hosts, And sit enthroned. Then shall his followers, clad In gorgeous raimentâseated in golden chairs, The necks of enemies beneath their feetâ In ecstacy unspeakable, behold Above the temple of Jerusalem His Temple rise with radiance that will make Aught else unseen; and while his chosen priests Shall with exalted trumpets pierce the sky, And Scribes and Pharisees, scorched with inward flames Sink into heaps of ashes, will the name Of Judas echo from an Angel's voice, Crying, âBehold, the one ordained of heaven To urge the great work of redemption on, Commencing with Christ's kingdom upon earth!â END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Marble Court in the Palace of Pontius Pilate. Nicodemus standing at the foot of a colossal Statue of Jupiter. Nico. Thou art of mighty structure, grand of brow, And capable to smite into the dust Thine own idolaters; but all unlike The Father of mankindâthe loving Spirit Whom Jesus hath declared the one true God, Above all terrible divinities. His words are as the seed of many thoughts That will spring up when he is in the tomb. Enter Claudia, with disordered robes. What fearful tidings bring'st thou?âmust he die? Clau. Is he condemned?âhow goes it in the hall? Oh Nicodemus, I have had a dream! Nico. What hast thou dreamed? Clau. Of pious martyrdomâ Ruin of empiresâdown-fall of the gods. It was at daybreak. Every moment since What I then suffered has surrounded me With equal terrors. Nico. Tell me this thy dream. Clau. Methought I sate upon an iron throne, And I was âRomeââthe Queen of all the world. Statues upheld my seat; in front was Mars Shining like blood, and Plutus golden-winged And blind, as usual with the god. Behind Were other figures. These I could not see, And yet I felt them softly beat and stir With fearful life, beneath my heaving seat. The throne was on a basement, broad and high, Of silver molten, like a rolling sea When the sun glares athwart the streaming wind. Beneath me, in a vast unbroken crowd, The generations of the earth were kneeling; And like great corn-fields bowing down their heads, In wavy masses far away they spread, Faint in the distance, mingling with the sky. Nico. This is some revelation. Clau. Presently A long-robed figure with a veiled head, Before me passed; a shepherd's crook he bore In his right hand, and at his side was slung An earthen water-vessel. 'Neath his veil I saw he wore a garland round his head. In his left hand a book lay open wide, Wherefrom he read aloud:ââThis is the book Which the ErythrÃ¦an Sibyl sold to Tarquin. And here 'tis written, âWoe to thee, O Rome, Thou art a murderess!âalso woe to thee, Murderous Jerusalem!ââ The augur's book Closed with a clap of thunder. He was gone. Nico. Because they murder Jesus! Saw'st thou more? Clau. The great field of the people now displayed Ridges of shade and light, in contest fierce; Then in the midst rose Jupiter, as here Thou see'st our nation's god; but more stupendous An hundred fold; and o'er the crowds he moved, Taking no note of those he crushed. While yet I gazed and trembled, transformations strange Were wrought, and from his mouth a dreadful sword Sting-like was darted forth, and from his hands Were scattered deadly plagues. Nico. What dream is this! Clau. Now thunder came, which was his voice, and spake Words that I understood not, but my throne Shook from behind, and then I knew the forms Supporting it, were Furies, Fates, and Hours! Meanwhile the myriads kneeling all below, Sent up a cry,âfor, lightnings that had played Round the god's head, had fallen, and the flames Were eating wide gaps through the living fields. Nico. Daughter, what manner of interpretation Would'st thouâ Clau. Hear more. The burning multitudes Held on their cry, until it brought an earthquakeâ Became articulateâand it was âChrist!â Down through the earthquake's jaws sank Jupiter, And with him the Plague-scatterer and the Sword. âChrist!â cried the sufferersâand lo! Christ came, Moving along the fieldâand all was still. Where lightnings played was now a smiling sky. Nico. And Christ? Clau. Was Jesusâhe whom they prepare E'en now to martyrâJesus the Nazarene! Nico. Knoweth thy lord that thou hast had this dream? Clau. No; he was risen ere day-break. I will send A messenger into the Judgment Hall, To warn him that he touch not this just man. Nico. I prythee haste! [Exeunt. Enter Judas, who gazes after them. He then seats himself on a pediment opposite the statue. Judas. A dream! They spake of sending To Pilate, seated in the Judgment Hall, To warn him. Aye, I knew it would be so. They spake in terror. In a little while Pilate will come down from his judgment throne, And kneel at Jesus' feet to sue forgiveness. Enter Two Lawyers. 1st Law. I witnessed the whole, for I was curious therein, having heard marvellous things of Jesus, and of his public speaking. 2nd Law. Tell me what thou knowest. I am but newly come to Jerusalem, in company with the Counsellor of Arimathea, who beareth a great love towards Jesus. 1st Law. When that the centurions and their spearmen had girded up their loins, and called upon their gods for help, so that they were able to lay hands upon Jesus, they took him straightway to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, and second in authority to him in the temple. But when Annas saw whom they had brought, he was afraid, and knew not what to do. And Jesus bade him take courage, that he should do what the law directed. But Annas turned away, telling them to take Jesus to Caiaphas, for it was fit that he should go before the High Priest. So they took Jesus before Caiaphas. 2nd Law. What said the High Priest unto him? 1st Law. Caiaphas adjured him by the living God that he should say if he were the Christ, the chosen of the Lord. And Jesus answered that he was the Christ, and that hereafter he should be seen sitting at the right hand of God. Then Caiaphas rent his robes; and the splendour of his vestments spared he not at all,âcrying aloud, âHe hath spoken blasphemyâ what need of further witnessesâye have heard him âwhat should be his sentence?â Then the priests, and scribes, and elders of the Sanhedrim, all answered with loud voices, âHe is guilty of death!â (Judas folds his arms.) 2nd Law. But how came he hither to be judged in yonder hall where Pilate now sits? 1st Law. After several of the servants, and others that were there, had smitten Jesus and scoffed at him, and spat upon him, the priests and scribes sent him to remain amidst the soldiers who sat around the fire; and they mocked him through the night, and peradventure they wrought him bodily pain and injury for their sport. Judas. The fiery ending of their sport will be the beginning of my gladness. 1st Law. What saith he? 2nd Law. Somewhat in hatred of the soldiers. Knowest thou aught else? 1st Law. This morning Caiaphas sent Jesus unto Pilate to be condemned to some manner of death. But Pilate said, âNayâtake him, and judge him yourselves by your law.â They answered and said, âWe cannot put any one to death, as thou knowest. He must die by the Roman law.â Then Pilate said to Jesus, âArt thou the King of the Jews?â And Jesus answered and said, âMy kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews.â Judas. (Aside.) Said he that his servants would fight if his kingdom were of this world? What need that his servants should rise up to fight when thousands of Archangels will descend from heaven at his bidding! Yeaâthis world also is his kingdom. 2nd Law. Therefore Pilate would not condemn him? 1st Law. Thou sayest well; and he sent him to Herod that the King might judge him. Now Herod had a great wish to see Jesus, who had wrought so many marvels; and he looked that some miracles or wonders would be wrought in his presence. But Jesus held his peace, and he lifted not his hand to do any wonder. So Herod and his men of war scoffed at Jesus, and sent him back to Pilate. Judas. (Half aside.) The miracles you ask will come anon, but not in such sort as ye desire. (Shouts outside the walls;ââAway with him!â âAway with him!â) Enter an Elder. 2nd Law. Why do the people shout? Elder. Pilate hath again been forth to them, saying that he findeth no fault with Jesus. Judas. (Aloud.) He beareth in mind the warning of his wife, and lo, he is wisely terrified with that which God revealed to her in a dream. 2nd Law. All this is very marvellous. 1st Law. But it is also natural. Judas. Moreâmore. Elder. (To Judas.) Hold thy peace, lest evil befal thee for thy speech. Enter Three Priests. 1st Priest. Let them shut the windows of the Judgment Hall; we shall hear nothing worth. Elder. Stood ye near enough outside the windows to hear all that was said, and yet to avoid being defiled? 2nd Priest. Yes; but Jesus spake not. 1st Law. I marvel that he uttered not his nicest oratory with a subtle tongue. 2nd Priest. He held his peace, or only spake with insolent and contumacious fewness of words. Judas. Presently he shall speak that which ye expected not to hear. 1st Law. Let us go to the outside beneath the open windows. [Exeunt Two Lawyers. 2nd Priest. Wherefore should Pilate hesitate to condemn him to death, and wherefore came he out twice unto us with vain words? Judas. Other words are coming that shall dry up your ears, as the things that shall follow will sting through your sight. 1st Priest. Who is this fellow that sitteth on one side, and threateneth with a forked tongue, like a viper in the shade? 3rd Priest. I saw a scourge in the hands of a soldier in the hall, and he was exercising his arm in the air. (Shouts outside.) Elder. Behold, Pilate hath a third time gone forth to the people! Judas. Pilate is sorely troubled. The hour!âthe hour! (Shouts and curses outside. Cries of âCrucify him! Crucify him!â (The Three Priests and the Elder join in the shout: âCrucify him! Crucify him!â) Judas. Ha! ha! ye vultures, ye ravensâbloody wolves that have no sense of coming things! 3rd Priest. Have a care; for thou art well known. Judas. (Rising up and lifting his arms in the air.) In a little while we shall all be knownâyea, by the purification of fire, and the changes of thrones and high seats! Our Lord, Christ, hath two kingdoms, one in heaven, and one upon earth,âthough of this last he maketh no boast. But he holdeth it in the hollow of his hand; and now he will grasp it fast, and deal with it as he listeth. (Sounds of measured blows, proceeding from within the Hall of Judgment.) 3rd Priest. Thou fool! hearest thou the blows of the scourge in the Hall, and sayest thou that Jesus holdeth the earth in his hand? Judas. The scourge!â 1st Priest. Let him take the rods out of the hand that smiteth him; that were power enough for his present need. (Measured sounds from the Hall continuing. Judas slowly re-seats himself.) Enter Scribe and Two Pharisees. Sc. &amp; Ph. Hail Masters, it is accomplished! 3rd Priest. He is condemned unto death? Sc. &amp; Ph. To be crucified! Scribe. Such is his sentence. 1st Phar. Pilate came forth and washed his hands before us, saying, âI am innocent of the blood of this just personâsee ye to it.â 3rd Priest. Called he this criminal a just person! 1st Priest. Whereupon all the people cried with a loud voice âHis blood be on us, and on our children.â (Measured sounds from the Hall, continued. Scribe. And forthwith began the scourging that ye hear. We beheld the blood following the blows, and by this time the chastisement that precedeth his death hath driven the red stream down to his feet, and beneath the feet of those who stand around. Judas. (Rising and hurrying into the midst.) Seemed it indeed that there was real bloodâthe blood of Jesus that flowed beneath their feet? (All shout in derision.) 1st Priest. Think'st thou it was water or wine that issued from his loins! Judas. (Stamping upon the pavement.) It was not blood! no blood have ye seenâneither shall Christ be crucified! What is your sentence but a wind, and your condemnation but an echo of the voice of waters! Verily, nothing of all this shall come to pass, but something else more terrible than the tongue of man can speak, shall burst upon you! The Great Temple of Jesus, who is Christ and King, shall rise before you, as though the sun rose up glaring through the earth, even as it is wont to rise from the sea. (All shout in derision.) Scribe. (To the Priests and Pharisees.) The people have cried aloud that he should be crucified, and this is his sentence; but let us take counsel awhile among ourselves whether some other death be not better suited. 2nd Phar. What better can we devise? Judas. (Abstractedly.) Dominion! dominion!âwhere is it? Scribe. Of strangling and stoning care I not to speak, neither of drowning with a weight about the neck; but of the sawing asunder let us take note, even as was the custom in the old time before us. 1st Priest. Not so; because the Prophet Isaiah died by that death, and because the idolater Manasseh ordered it. 2nd Phar. Were it good that he were given to wild beasts? Judas. (With anguish.) He isâhe is! 2nd Priest. Not so; because the Prophet Daniel was cast into the den of lions. Scribe. But coming out whole and untouched, while Jesus would be rent in pieces, this might be regarded as a fitting expiation. 2nd Phar. Choose we rather the braying in the mortar, which is a goodly punishment. 3rd Priest. I have bethought me in the night that we should burn him with slow fire, first sealing up his eyes, while his ears were filled with strange sounds as the heat of the furnace began to rise. This were lawful. (Tumult outside.) Scribe. Behold, what manner of King is he who slowly passeth along from the Hall! His crown is a mockery of bloody thorns. Seest thou, Judas, yonder King with his crown! [Judas rushes out, rending his garments and his beard. 1st Priest. Let Jesus be crucified; there is no other death so vile as this. All. Crucify him! Crucify him! [Exeunt Omnes. (A crowd of Roman Military and Civil Officers, in merry conversation, pass across, and Exeunt. Enter Pontius Pilate and Claudia. Clau. Wherefore I pray my lord to use his power, Even to the utmost, listening to the voice Of heaven's high oracles, as in my dream Revealed; the voice of justice, which thou know'st Crieth aloud for himâah, louder far Than all the curses of the yelling Jews; The voice of natural feeling in your heart, Which saith âbe merciful;â and last of all The voice of her who once within your eyes Was passing fairâyour humble, loving wife. Pilate. Claudia. Claud. I do intreatâmy lordâ Pilate. Be patient. Claud. I would be soâI ever after willâ But patience now is certain death to him. Pilate. He teacheth patience. Claud. But not hardness of heart. Thou art not all so hard as thou appear'st, And men believe; the judgment throne is hard, Therefore thy bearing doth assort with it Of need,âan evil of authority, Not to be gainsayed nor avoidedâ Pilate. Wife, Be calmâand silent. He hath sought his death. Claud. Not soânot sought itâsoldiersâ Pilate. Claudia! It is enough. Three times did I go forth Unto the furious Jews, opening all chances For his releaseâwhether by change of mind In the multitudeâby fear, love, ficklenessâ Such as the memory of his miracles, His marvellous cures, preaching, and fortitude,â And something in his presence that betokened One of a spirit beyond martyrdomâ Might well have bred. Also I gave him time That he should well bethink himself, and use His wondrous gift of speech. But he was muteâ Or when not mute, he exercised no power Of inspirationâwrought no miracleâ Nor prophesied. For these things men had looked, Excitedly,âthe which I waited for, To turn to his account. Enter Judas behind. Claud. And not one word Spake heâ Pilate. Nor gave one lookânor made one sign To save himselfânor manifested wish That I should save him. Wherefore I conclude It was his purpose, and his will to die. Claud. Woe to thee, Rome! thou art a murderess! Woe to Jerusalemâa murderess also! Thus spake the augur in my dream. Pilate. His blood Is not on meâI have washed my hands; and did so Before the people, as a last resource To make them pause. The bearded Hebrews howled, âHis blood be upon usâand on our children.â So be it! I did all I could, with safety,â And somewhat more than prudent, in my place, Not safe from all corruption, nor men's tongues. Therefore be thoughtful. Speak of this no more. [Exeunt Pilate and Claudia. (Judas slowly clasps and raises his hands.) Judas. Now Darkness, build a Temple o'er my soul, And let a torrent roll around the base To drown the stars! Let the high priest be Death, And on the altar place the accursed form Of Judas, ever dying, yet alive To constant sacrificeâwhile tongues of fire Follow the knife's course, shrieking out his sin Through every running vein! Come, monstrous Hell, And be a friend to Judas!âfrom earth's eye, Swallow him upâand from the eye of heaven. (Sinks down with his face in the dust.) (Scene closes.) SCENE II. Interior of the Temple of Jerusalem. Outer Courts and Eastern Gate visible, with the Mount of Olives in the distance. Enter Caiaphas, Annas, and an Elder. Elder. I was among the crowd, and near unto the officers and soldiers, noting all things even as ye had desired me, but taking no active part therein. And I say again, thus did the soldiers. Annas. Stepped they backward many paces? Elder. They retired from before Jesus, and fell down upon the earth, as if they had suddenly beheld the glory of a great light. Caia. Thou speakest as if he had wrought upon their spirits; but have we not proof that his followers were armed, and did battle for him. Verily, my servant Malchus had been cleft in twain, but that the sword of his assailant glanced aside in his fury. Elder. He that smote him, Jesus reproved. Annas. Then came the soldiers once more to seize him, and sayest thou he offered no resistance? Elder. They were troubled at the sight of him; but he gave himself up to be bound. Had he raised his hand, or prophesied, so would they all again have fallen to the earth. But he gave himself peacefully into their charge. Caia. How knowest thou what more the soldiers had done if he had resisted them? Shall men of good estate be permitted to speak with a foolish tongue? It hath been told me that certain pharisees sent to Jesus, ere this, to warn him that he should escape! Shall the disease spread so deep and climb so high, and the heavens put on no blackness? Howbeit he is now secured, and condemned to death, and an end hath come to all his blasphemies, and to the evil he hath sent abroad into men's spirits. Annas. In good season hath it all ended. Caia. Therefore have we devised the extremity of all disgrace to attend upon the manner of his death; by crucifixion and by the companionship of thieves, so that no disciples shall go forth in future without fear of stoning, and no man utter the name of Jesus without shame and scorn. Annas. Who is he that cometh yonder up the steps of the court, profaning the Temple? Elder. Peradventure one of the artificers or labourers, who work in the outer buildings. Annas. A bibber of wine!âfor, see how he rusheth and reeleth forward! His presence here is death by the law! Elder. Hath he fallen upon the lowermost steps, that ye see him not again? Annas. His head riseth above the upper pavement! Caia. Wherefore cometh he? Hath he also a sword? Annas. He hath not put off his shoes! Elder. Behold, his garments are rent!âhe hath a ragged tawny beardâhis eyes are red with bloodâand his mouth is wide open, that uttereth no sound! Enter Judas wildly. Caia. Whom seekest thou? Darest thou affront the High Priest! Annas. Knowest thou the man? Caia. I know him. This is he who betrayed Jesus to justice for thirty pieces of silver. Elder. Speak, profaner of the Temple! Judas. I have sinned!âI have betrayed innocent blood! Caia. What is that to us? See thou to that! (Judas staggers on one side towards the altar.) Elder. His eyes glareâthe foam gusheth through his teeth! Caia. Behold what he doeth! Behold, he graspeth the golden horns of the altar! Elder. He hath a horror that riseth up amidst his hair:â wrath and madness are bursting out of his mouth! Annas. Give him more piecesâgive him pieces of gold, and let him go his ways! Caia. He thrusteth one hand into his breast to tear out his heart! See that he pollute not the Temple!â have a care of God's holy place, and of God's anointed ministers! Annas. He hath a demon! [Judas dashes a handful of silver pieces upon the pavement, and rushes away out of sight. (Scene closes.) SCENE III. The field of Aceldama, flanked by a wood. Mount Calvary in the distance. Time, evening. Enter John, James, and Peter with his face hidden in his hands. John. Take comfort; for our Lord hath often said The truth that rests at bottom of the heart, By that shall ye be judged; let it come forth In act, and then 'tis virtue. Peter. How did truth Come forth in me? John. 'Twas but an accident Of half thy nature; but when thou didst draw Thy sword, then spake thy heart;âand deeper spake When at his bidding thou didst sheath the blade. Come on with us. James. Come, see our Master die, That our last lesson from himâhow to bear The loss of earthly hopes for the truth's sake, We may receive. Peter. And also how to give Our life in martyrdom for his dear name. John. Come, Peter!âbrother, come! Peter. I am unworthy. [Exit Peter. John. Our Lord is on his way. Hear you the noise Of the distant multitude? James. Where shall we stand? John. Beside his lofty Cross, until it tremble With his last anguishâand his victory. [Exeunt. Enter a crowd of Jewish people; men, women and children; with a number of Roman soldiers mingling among them. (Many Jewish voices cry aloud,â âCrucify him! crucify him! âHis blood be on us, and on our children!â [Exeunt. Enter Judas, with a handful of earth clutched in his fingers. Judas. If he, being Son of God, consent to die, Seeming to prove the truth of all their taunts;â If, with the power he hath to smite this cityâ The temple, tabernacle, all the hosts And men of valourâpharisees, scribes, priestsâ He will not speakâhe will not lift his hand;â If truly, God in him, can with a thought Bring earthquake underneath Jerusalem, To swallow all, save his own chosen flock, Yet he consent meekly to be nailed down Upon a felon's Cross, which they have sworn To plant on yonder mount between two thieves, There, 'midst revilings, taunts, and jeers, to dieâ The drooping head, the languishing swoll'n limbsâ Heâour Lord Jesusâwhom I have betrayed, Dying this deathâO God, the Eternal Eye! Scorch up this reasoningâblight each maddening senseâ Confuse my life with any creeping thing, So that I know it notâmake me a stone, Wherefrom no iron-heel shall strike one sparkâ Make me a darkness!âlet me melt to rain, And steal beneath the earth! I hear them coming! (Judas drops on his knees.) Seest thou, Jehovah, him thou fashionedst With strength and order, what he hath become? A wild and hideous perplexity, That hideth from himself! Oh pass him by, E'en as this clot of earth, which he scraped up To look for death, and leave this upper hellâ And in especial save him from this nightâ See him notâknow him notânor ask for him. (Rising in terror.) Where is the man called Judas?âwhere is he? Thunder is in my brainâthe clouds are silent. No where, Lord!âno whereâJudas is no more! (Voices of a distant crowd.) Enter Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. Nico. This is the man, Judas Iscariot! See where he lurketh underneath the trees! Joseph. Let not our eyes behold him, lest we dream Of monstrous things that breed unholy thoughts, And loss of faith in nature. Hast thou seen The place I have selected for the tomb Of Jesus? Nico. I have seen it. Judas. No! no! no! He is not deadâhe is the Son of God, And cannot die!âwhy speak ye of the tomb! Unless it be for Judas? Joseph. Thither we Will bear his sacred body, and our hearts Shall dwell with him in that cold sepulchre Where glory seeketh rest within the shade. Nico. Aloes, and myrrh, and spices will I bring, And swathes of finest linen. Joseph. We must sue To Pilate first, that he should render us The body. (Judas smites his forehead with his earthy hand.) Nico. He will grant this, if all's done With secrecy. Joseph. Lord Jesus, we attend thee! [Exeunt Joseph and Nicodemus. Judas. The body, said they!âhow the field whirls round! A pharisee and a lawyer bury Christ! Bury him!âbury the Son of God! And nowâ The women come! It is the Mother of Christ That walketh foremost with a steadfast eye, Red with her sleepless anguish, but no tear. Her thoughts are heavenwardâwhere shall I crouch down?â I still must stare upon her! Enter Mary (the Mother of Christ) and her Sister; Mary Magdalene, and Mary the wife of Cleophas. M. Mag. Twice he sank Beneath the weightâI saw him through the crowd. His pale, long-suffering face look'd up to God, And smiled. Wife of C. Then from his shoulders, newly scourged, Took they the cross, seeing he could not walk, For very faintness under blows and wounds. M. Magd. Not pitying, but cursingâshall I speak Of curses, and not use them? (She points towards Judas.) M. Sister. 'Tis the shadow Of a tree-trunk. M. Magd. Behind it croucheth close A wild beast, gnashing in his impotence, Or in remorse, as vain. There is no hope That Judas shall find pardon on the earth, Nor in the grave. Earth with its myriad snakes, Hisseth against him, and the grave will utter A shriek at his approach! Nothing remains For him but constant horror, and himself. Mother. Do not disturb the greatness of the hour. M. Sister. Jesus approacheth. Let us follow him, And take our places upon Calvary. [Exeunt, all but Judas. Judas. One saith, behold a monster! another saith, Lo! a wild beast! (Sounds of an approaching crowd. Judas clasps his arms round a tree, and tears the bark with his teeth.) Enter Lazarus, solemnly. Laza. Cold with the shadows of the grave upon me, And dusky in my body and my mind, I yet do walk abroad with higher sense Of life;âand round about me wonders floatâ Gleamings and whispersâand before my path God's finger sometimes writeth in the sand. Judas. (in an audible whisper). Thou art one risen from the dead!âOh tell me, If the dead recollect their deeds on earth? Laza. Somebody speaketh. Judas. Come no nearer to him.â Thou saidst God's finger wrote upon the sand, What did it write?âJudas Iscariot? Laza. Doth thy crime fill thy mind to such a pass, Thou think'st God writeth of it? Judas. Verily. Laza. Then I will pray for thee. Judas. Oh terrible! (Judas sinks behind the tree, as Lazarus raises his hands.) Laza. Jehovah!âSpirit of all life we knowâ All life unknownâwhether in earth or star, Or in the region men call deathâGreat Father Of the Divine One who is on his way To die upon a cross between two thievesâ Let him, who seemeth awful to himself, Because he hath approached thy shadow nearer Than other menâand hath thereby a sense Of somewhat more profoundly spiritual Thrilling on all sidesâoffer up a prayer, Asking for mercy and a gentle death, In Christ's pure name, which halloweth all words;â (Tumult near at hand.) Judas. âQuick! quick! I hear them. (A Concourse pass along the back of the field, with a large Cross borne in the midst of them. They ascend Calvary in the evening twilight.) Laza. Pardon me, O Christ, That I, bewildered with my double lifeâ My hope and joy, each deep as is the grave, And melancholy by profundityâ Have strayed from thy dear side at this great hour Of agony and triumph! Lo, I follow. [Exit Lazarus. Judas. The prayer! the prayer for me, O Lazarus! The prayer's unfinished, and he's gone! Will no one Haste after himâor fall at Jesus' feet And tell the history of my matchless sin, And that I never thought of death to himâ Never believed in itâI dreamed of nothing But power's surpassing glory. Give me strength Ye fibrous treesâthou teeming earthâthou sky, With all thy mighty shades, that I may leave This hideousness, and follow him. On! on! My limbs are crampedâmy mouth is full of dust, Mine eyes spin webs of fireâOh mercy, Christ! Mercy! for thou canst hear me from afarâ Hear me scream âMercy!â (Distant sounds of the heavy blows of a hammer on Calvary.) Golgotha replies! And all the echoes round Mount Calvary! Can it be! Yes!âthey nail him through the hands. I see the springing bloodâit stains the vests Of those who murder him! He prayeth for themâ Forgiveth them!âme, too, Lord! I have ever Loved theeâbut I grew madâand now I wake! How pale he lies!âhow patient! Cover me Ye bloody trees!âye flapping shadows snatch me Away into your caverns! Lazarus! Come back!âwill no one hear me! (Heavy blows of a hammer echo from Calvary.) Through his feet The great nail slowly crushes!âpierces down Into the wood! Oh Pilate, once againâ 'Tis not too lateâcome forth unto the peopleâ Command all this to ceaseâthis mockery Tow'rds one who cannot dieâand yet he will! The Son of God will die! Scribes, pharisees! Thou damned Caiaphas, and all the priests Thrice cursed of God, come here! come here! And see your work! Your work and mine! I meant it notâI never dreamed of thisâ Witness ye glaring creatures that whirl round me! Witness my soulâwitness before my God, For even I, name God,âI mustâI mustâ And He will be the wise Judge! See your work, Ye priests and rulers. Oh, I know my share. Hark! hark!âThey raise the Cross! They bear it to its bedâthey drop its foot Heavily down!âThe jar shakes all his frame With torturesâsickening! Where is Death for me? Come wrestlerâcome! take Judas in thine arms, And win, dark ideotâso shall Judas gain A hiding place! (Judas tears out some long trailing thorns and green tendrils, and twisting them about his throat, rushes to a tree, which he ascends. Darkness spreads over the face of the earth.) Judas. (From the midst of the tree.) Mother of all the graves, Open them all for Judas! Bid him, O, Mother of Corruption, seek The lowest, and the darkest! Christ have mercy, And let him find it! Plunge for ever down! (Judas springs downwardsâthe tree falls with a crash, and covers his crushed body with its black foliage. The earth trembles. Graves open,âand pale Forms rise, and gaze around!) FINIS.</field>
