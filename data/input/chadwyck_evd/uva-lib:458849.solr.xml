Prologues to Playes in vse, and common are, As Vshers to Great Ladies: Both walke bare, And comely both; conducting Beauty they And wee appeare, to vsher in our Play. Yet, be their faces foule, or featur'd well, Be they hard-fauoured, or in lookes excell; Yet being Vsher, he owes no lesse duty Vnto the most deformed, then the choise Beautie. It is our case; we vsher Acts and Scenes, Some honest, and yet some may proue like Queanes. (Loose and base stuffe) yet that is not our fault, We walke before, but not like Panders hault Before such cripled ware: Th'Acts we present We hope are Virgins, drawne for your content Vnto this Stage: Maides gratefull are to Men, Our Scenes being such, (like such) accept them then.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus Scena prima. Enter Iulia and Strazo. Iulia. That shee should doo't? Stroza. Shee? Iul. May we build vpon't? Str. As on a base of Marble; I haue seene Strange passages of loue, loose enter changes Of hands and eyes betwixt her and the Prince, Madame looke too't. Iul. What hope hath he in one So meanly bred? or shee t'obtaine a Prince Of such discent and linnage? Str. What but this That you must vndergoe the name of wife, And she to intercept the sweetes of loue Due to your bed. Iul. To be his strumpet Stroza? Str. Madame a woman may guesse vnhappily. Iul. Thou shouldst be honest Stroza. Str. Yes, many should Be what they are not: but I alwayes was, And euer will be one, (that's still my selfe.) Iul. The Generall Sforsaes daughter? is't not she? Str. Is that yet questioned? as if the chaste Court Had saue her selfe one so degenerate, So dissolutely wanton, so profuse In prostitution too, so impudent And blushlesse in her proud ambitious aime, As if no man could her intemperance please, Saue him whom Heauen hath destin'd to your bed. Iul. I neuer saw them yet familiar. Str. Ha, ha, as if they'd send for you to see't, To witnesse what they most striue to conceale, Be guld? be branded: 'las to me, all's nothing, I shall ne're smart for't, what is't to me? If being a Bride, you haue a widdowed fortune; If being married, you must throw your selfe Vpon a desolate bed, and in your armes, Claspe nought but Ayre, whilst his armes full of pleasure Borrow'd from a stolne beauty, shall this grieue Or trouble me? breake my sleepes? make me starte At midnight vp, and fill the house with clamours? Shall this bring strange brats to be bred and brought Vp at my fire, and call me Dad? No: this Concernes not me more then my loue to you To your high Soueraignty. Iul. I now repent Too late, since I too lauishly haue giuen him The vtmost he could aske, and stretcht my honour Beyond all lawfull bounds of modesty. Hee's couetous of others, and neglects His owne; but I will part those their stolne pleasures, And crosse those lustfull sports they haue in chase, Not be the pillow to my owne disgrace. Exit. Str. The game's on foote, and there's an easie path To my reuenge; this beauteous Millanois Vnto th'Duke sole heire, still courted, crau'd, And by the Parma Prince sollicited, Which I still study how to breake, and cast Aspersions betwixt both of strange dislike; But wherein hath the other innocent Mayde So iniur'd me, that I should scandall her? Her Father is the Generall to the Duke: For when I studdied to be rais'd by Armes, And purchase me high eminence in Campe, He crost my fortunes, and return'd me home A Cashierd Captaine; for which iniury I scandall all his meanes vnto the Duke, And to the Princesse all his daughters vertues, I labour to inuert, and bring them both Into disgracefull hatred. Enter Prince Parma. Par. Stroza? Str. My Lord? Par. Saw you the Princesse? Str. Iulia? Par. She? Str. I haue my Lord of late no eare of hers, Nor she a tongue of mine; the, time hath bin Till soothing Sycophants and Court Parasites Supplanted me. Par. I haue the power with her To bring thee into grace. Str. Haue you the power To keepe your selfe in? doe you smile my Lord? Par. I tell thee Stroza, I haue that interest In Iulias bosome, that the proudest Prince In Italy cannot supplant me thence. Str. Sir, I no way question it: but haue I not knowne A Prince hath bin repulst, and meanest persons Bosom'd? the Prince would once haue lookt vpon me, When small intreaty would haue gain'd an eye, An eare, a tongue, to speake yea, and a heart, To thinke I could be secret. Par. What meanes Stroza? Str. But 'tis the fate of all mortality: Man cannot long be happy; but my passion Will make me turne blab, I shall out with all. Par. Whence comes this? 'tis suspicious, and I must be Inquisitiue to know't. Str. A Iest my Lord, I'le tell you a good Iest. Par. Prithee let's heare it. Str. What will you say, if at your meeting next With this faire Princesse? shee begins to raue, To raile vpon you, to exclaime on your Inconstancy, and call the innocent name Of some chaste Maide in question, whom perhaps You neuer ey'd my Lord. Par. What of all this? Str. What but to excuse her owne: (I'le not say what) Put off the purpos'd Contract: and my Lord Come, come, I know you haue a pregnant wit. Par. We parted last with all the kindest greeting Louers could adde fare-well with: but should this change Suite thy report, I should be forc't to thinke That, which euen Oracles themselues could neuer Force me to that she is. Str. All women are not Sincerely constant, but obserue my Lord. Enter Iulia, the Generals Wife, and Lauretta her Daughter. Iul. Minion is't you? there's for you, know your owne. Str. Obseru'd you that my Lord? Iulia meets her and strikes her, then speakes. Lau. Why did you strike me Madame? Iul. Strumpet, why? Dare you contest with vs? Lau. Who dare with Princesse? subiects must forbeare Each step I treade I'le water with a teare. Exeunt Mother and Lauretta weeping. Str. I spy a storme a comming, Ile to shelter. Exit Stro. Par. Your meaning Madame? Iul. Did it Sir with yours But correspond, it would be bad indeede. Par. VVhy did you strike that Lady? Iul. Cause you should pitty her. Par. Small cause for blowes. Iul. I strucke her publickly. Par. You giue her blowes in priuate. Par. Stroza still? Iul. Goe periurd and dispose thy false allurements 'Mongst them that will beleeue thee, thou hast lost Thy credit here for euer. Par. I shall finde Faith else-where then. Iul. Eye spread thy snares To catch poore innocent Maides: and hauing tane them In the like pit-fall, with their shipwrackt honours, Make seasure of their liues. Par. Iniurious Lady, All thou canst touch my Honour with, I cast On thee, and henceforth I will flye thee as A Basaliske. I haue found the change of lust, Your loose inconstancy, which is as plaine To me, as were it writ vpon thy brow, You shall not cast me off: I hate thy sight, And from this houre I will abiure thee quite. Exit Parma. Iul. Ile call him backe: if Stroza be no villaine, He is not worth my clamour. What was that startled Within me? Oh I am dishonoured Perpetually; for he hath left behinde That pledge of his acquaintance, that will for euer Cleaue to my blood in scandall, I must now Sue, send, and craue, and what before I scorn'd By prayers to grant, submissiuely implore. Exit Iulia. A flourish. Enter the Duke of Millenie, the Generals wife, and deliuers a petition with Stroza, Lauretta, and attendants. Duke. Lady your suite? Wife. So please your Grace peruse it, It is included there. Duk. Our generals Wife? Duk. We know you Lady, and your beauteous Daughter, Nay you shall spare your knee, Str. More plot for mee; My brain's in labour, and must be deliuered Of some new mischeife? Duk. You petition heere For Men and Money! making a free relation Of all your Husbands fortunes, how supplyes Haue beene delay'd, and what extremities He hath indurd at Naples dreadfull Seige; We know them all, and withall doe acknowledge All plentious blessings by the power of Heauen, By him wee doe obtaine, and by his valour Lady we greue he hath beene so neglected. Wife. O Roiall Sir, you still were Gratious, But twixt your Vertues and his Merits there Hath beene some interception, that hath stopt The current of your fauours. Duk. All which shal bee remou'd, and hee appeare Henceforth a bright starre in our courtly spheare. Str. But no such Comet here shall daze my sight, Whilst I a Cloud am to Eclips that light Exit Stroza. Duk. We sent out our Commissions two Monthes since For Men and Money, nor was't our intent It should bee thus delayd: though we are Prince, We onely can command, to Execute Tis not in vs but in our Officers, We vnderstand that by their negligence He has beene put to much extremity Of Dearth and Famine; many a stormy night Beene forc'd to roofe himselfe i'th open field, Nay more then this, much of his owne reuenue He hath expended, all to pay his Souldiers: Yet Reuerend Madame, but forget what's past, Though late, weele quit his merit at the last. Enter Iulia and Stroza whispering. Wife. Your Highnesse is most Royall? Stro. Her Father shall be in the Campe releiu'd, She grac'd in Court, how will she braue you then? If suffer this take all? why the meanest Lady Would neuer brooke an equall? you a Princesse? And can you brooke a base competitor? Iulia. It shall not, we are fixt and stand immou'd, And will be swaid by no hand. Duk. Iulia? Iulia. A Sutor to that Lady Royall Father, Before she be a widdow that you are So priuate in discourse? Duk. O you mistake, For shee the sutor is and hath obtain'd. Iulia. I'm glad I haue found you in the giuing vaine. Will you grant me one boone to? Duk. Question not, To hast your Marriage with the former Prince, Or at the least the contract, is't not that? Iulia. Say twere my Lord? Duk. It could not be denide But speake? thy suite? Iulia. To haue this modest Gentlewoman Banisht the Court, Wife. My Daughter Royall princesse, Show vs some cause I beg it? Iulia. Lady though You be i'th begging vaine, I am not now In the giuing, will you leaue vs? Lauretta. Wherein O Heauen Haue I deseru'd your wrath, that you should thus Persue me? I haue searcht, indeed beyond My vnderstanding, but yet cannot finde? Wherein I haue offended by my chastity. Iulia. How chastitiy? A thing long sought 'mongst Captains wiues and daughters, Yet hardly can bee found. Duk. Faier Lady yeild Vnto my daughters spleen her rage blowne 'ore, Feare not, Ile make your peace, as for your suite Touching your husband, that will I secure. Iul. Haste Stroza, vnto the Prince his chamber, Giue him this letter, it concernes my honor, My state, my life, all that I can call good Depends vpon the safe deliuery Of these few broken Letters. Str. Maddam, tis doneâ Exit. Iul. VVhat stayes she to out-face me? Lau. Madam, I yeeld VVay to your spleene, not knowing whence it growes, Bearing your words more heauy then your blowes. Wife. Small hope there is to see the Father righted VVhen the child is thus wrong'd. Enter a Souldier and Stroza. Soul. Must speake with the Duke, Str. Must fellow? stay your howre, and dance attendance Vntill the Duke's at leisure. Soul. Ile doe neither, I come in haste with newes, Str. VVhy then keepe out sir. Soul. Ha Milksop? know percullist gates Though kept with Pikes &amp; Muskets, could nere kepe me out And dost thou thinke to shut me out with VVainscot? Duk. VVhat's he? Soul. A Souldier, Duk. VVhence? Soul. The Campe Duk. The newes? Soul. A mighty losse; a glorious victory Duke. But which the greater? Soul. Tis vncertaine Sir: But will you heare the best or bad newes first? Duke. Cheere me with conquest first, that being arm'd With thy best newes, we better may endure What sounds more fatall. Soul. Heare me then my Lord, We sack't the Citty after nine Moneths siege, Furnisht with store of all warres furniture, Our (neuer to be praisd enough) braue Generall Fought in the Cannons face, their number still Increast, but our diminisht; their souldiers pay Doubled, and ours kept backe: but we (braue spirits) The losse we had of Coyne, the more we tooke Vnto our selues of Courage, but when all Our furniture was spent euen to one day, And that to morrow we must be inforc't To raise a shameful siege, then stood our General (Our valiant Generall) vp, and breath'd vpon vs His owne vndaunted spirit, which spred through The Campe, return'd it doubly arm'd againe: For he did meane to lay vpon one shott His state and fortune, and then instantly He bad vs arme and follow: On then he went, We after him; oh! 'twas a glorious sight, Fit for a Theater of Gods to see, How we made vp and mauger all opposure, Made way through raging stormes of showring bullets; At last we came to hooke our ladders, and By them to skale. The first that mounted, was Our bold couragious Generall: after him Ten thousand, so we instantly were made Lords of the Citty, purchas'd in two houres After a nine Moneths siege: all by the valour Of our approued Generall. Duke. I neuer heard a brauer victory, But what's our losse? Soul. Oh that, which ten such Conquests Cannot make good, your worthy Generall. Wife. My Lord and husband? spare me passion, I must with-draw to death. Exit. Duke. How perish't he? What dy'de he by the sword? Soul. Sword? No alas, No sword durst byte vpon his noble flesh, Nor bullet raze his skinne: he whom War feared, The Cannon spar'd, no steele durst venture on. No Duke, 'twas thy vnkinde ingratitude Hath slaine braue Sforsa. Duke. Speake the cause? Soul. I shall: This Citty seaz'd, his purpose was the spoyle To giue his Souldiers; but when his seal'd Commission He had vnript, and saw expresse command, To deale no farther then to victory, And that his great Authority was curb'd, And giuen to others, that respect their profit More then the worth of souldiers: euen for griefe, That he could neither furnish vs with pay Which was kept back, nor guerdon vs with spoile, What was about him he distributed, Euen to the best deseruers, as his garments, His Armes, and Tent, then some few words spake, And so opprest with griefe, his great heart brake. Str. There's one gone then. Duke. Attend for thy reward, So leaue vs. Soul. Pray on whom shall I attend? VVho is't must pay me? Str. I sir. Soul. You sir? tell me, VVill it not cost me more the waiting for, Then the summe comes to when it is receiu'd? I doe but aske the question. Str. You are a bold And saucy souldier. Soul. You are a cunning slaue, And cowardly Courtier. Duke. See all things be dispatcht Touching conditions of attoned peace 'Twixt vs and Naples: see that souldier to Haue his reward. Soul. Come will you pay me sir? Exit Soul. Str. Sir, will you walke: as for your saucinesse I'le teach you a Court-tricke: you shal be taught How to attend. Duke. But that our General's lost: Str. Is't not now peace, what should a Generall doe? Had he return'd, he would haue lookt for honours, This suite and that for such a follower: Now Royall sir, that debt is quite discharg'd. Duke. But for his wife, we must be mindefull of her, And see we doe so. Exit Duke. Iul. Speake, will he come? Str. Madam, I found him ready to depart The Court with expedition: but at my vrgence He promis't you a parley. Iul. It is well: If prayers or teares can moue him, Ile make way To saue my owne shame, and enforce his stay. Exeunt. Enter three souldiers: one without an arme. 1 Soul. Come fellow souldiers, doe you know the reason That we are summon'd thus vnto the house Of our dead Generall? 2 Soul. Sure 'tis about Our pay. 3 Soul. But stand aside, here comes the Lady. Enter the Mother, Lauretta, and Clowne. Wife. Are all these Gentlemen summond together, That were my Husbands followers, and whose fortunes Expir'd in him? Clo. They are if please your Ladiship: though I was neuer Tawny-coate, I haue playd the summoners part, and the rest are already paide, onely these three attend your Ladiships remuneration. Wife. VVelcome Gentlemen, My Husband led you on to many dangers Two yeares, and last to pouerty: His reuenewes Before hand he sold to maintaine his Army, VVhen the Dukes pay still fail'd, you know you were Stor'd euer from his Coffers. 1 Soul. He was a right And worthy Generall. 2 Soul. He was, no lesse. Clo. He was no lesse; and all you know hee was no more, well, had he liu'd, I had beene plac't in some house of office or other ere this time. Wife. It was his will, which to my vtmost power I will make good, to satisfie his souldiers To the vtmost farthing. All his Gold and Iewels I haue already added, yet are we still To score to souldiery? what is your summe? 1 Soul. Pay for three Moneths. Wife. There's double that in Gold. 1 Soul. I thanke your Ladiship. Wife. VVhat yours? 2 Soul. VVhy Madam, For foure Moneths pay. Wife. This Iewell surmounts that. 2 Soul. I am treble satisfied. Wife. You are behinde hand too. Clo. By but Madam, I thinke he be no true souldier. Wife. No true Souldier? your reason? Clo. Marry because he walkes without his Armes. Wife. The Dukes Treasure Cannot make good that losse, yet are we rich In one thing: Nothing we haue that were of nothing made, Nothing we owe, my Husbands debts are payd. Morrow Gentlemen. All. Madam, Hearts, Swords and hands, rest still At your command. Wife. Gentlemen I'me forty that I cannot pay you better, Vnto my wishes and your owne desert, 'Tis plainely seene great Persons oft times fall, And the most Rich cannot giue more then all. Good morrow Gentlemen, All. May you be euer happy. Exeunt Souldiers. Clo. I but Madam, this is a hard case being truly considered, to giue away all, why your Shoe-maker, though he hath many other Tooles to worke with, he will not giue away his All. Wife. All ours was his alone, it came by him. And for his Honour it was paid againe. Clo. VVhy, say I had a peece of Meate, I had a mind to, I might perhaps giue away a Modicum, a Morcell, a Fragment or so, but to giue away and bee a hungry my selfe, I durst not doo't for my Guts, or say I should meete with a friend that had but one Penny in his Purse, that should giue mee a Pot of Ale, that should drinke to me, and drinke vp all, I'le stand too't there's no Conscience in't. Lau. VVhat hath benee done was for my Fathers Honor. Clo. Shee might haue giuen away a little, and a little, but VVhen all is gone, what's left for me? Wife. VVee will leaue Millaine and to Florence straight, Though wee are poore, yet where we liue vnknowne 'Tis the lesse griefe, sirrah, will you consort VVith vs, and beare a part in our misfortunes? Clo. Troth Madam, I could find in my heart to goe with you but for one thing. Wife. What's that? Clow. Because you are too liberall a Mistresse: and that's a fault seldome found among Ladies: For looke, you vse to giue away all, and I am all that is left; and I am affraide when you come into a strange Countrey, you'le giue away me too, so that I shall neuer liue to be my owne man. Wife. Tush, feare it not. Clow. Why then I'le goe with you in spite of your teeth. Wife. Leaue Milleine then, to Florence be our guide, Heauen when man failes, must for our helpe prouide.

That hand in Contract you so long haue had, Should not seeme strange to you now. Par. You are with-childe, So doth your Letter say: what change your face? Iu. My blushes must speake for me. Par. And this Childe You would bestow on me: y'are very liberall Lady, You giue me more then I did meane to aske. Iu. And yet but what's your owne Sir, I am serious, And it will ill become your Oathes and Vowes To iest at my vndoeing. Par. You would say Rather your doing. Iu. In doing thus, you should vndoe me quite. Par. What doe you weepe, that late did rayle in clamor? Your thunders turnd to showres? It is most strange. Iu. You haue dishonoured me, and by your flattery Haue rob'd me of my chaste Virginity: Yet ere I yeelded, we were man and wife, Sauing the Churches outward Ceremony. Par. But Lady, you that would be wonne by me To such an act of lust, would soone consent Vnto another. Iu. Can this be found in man? Par. This Strozas language moues me, and I intend To try what patience, constancy, and loue There can be found in woman: why do you weepe? You are not hungry, for your bellie's full; Lady, be rul'd by me: take the aduice A Doctor gaue a Gentleman of ate, That sent to him to know, whether Tobacco Were good for him or no: My friend quoth he, If thou didst neuer loue it, neuer take it; If thou didst euer loue it, neuer leaue it: So I to thee; if thou wert as thou hast Beene alwayes honest, I could wish thee still So to continue; but being a broken Lady, Your onely way's to make vse of your Talent, Farewell, I'le to my Countrey.

Duke. Iulia. Iu. Away. Duke. Come hither, but one word. Iu. That all those blacke occurrents should conspire, And end in my disgrace. Duke. Ha! what's the businesse? Iu. If all men were such, I should be sorry that a man begot me, Although he were my father. Duke. Iulia, how's that? Iul. Oh Sir, you come to know whether Tobacco be good for you or no; Ile tell you, if you neuer tooke it, neuer take it then, or if you euer vs'd it, take it still; Nay, I'me an excellent Phisitian growne of late I tell you. Duke. What meane these strange Anagrams? I am thy Father and I loue thee sweete. Iul. Loue me thou dost not. Duke VVhy thou doest know I doe. Iul. I say thou doest not: lay no wager with me, For if thou dost, there will be two to one On my side against thee. Duke. Ha! I am thy Father, Why Iulia? Iu. How my Father! then doe one thing For me your Daughter. Duke. One thing? any thing, By all things. Iu. Instantly then draw your sword, And pierce me to the heart. Duke.

Iul. Strike, I'le stand. Duke. How easie could I period all my care, Could I her kill, and yet her Infant spare: A double Murder I must needes commit, To ruine that which neuer offended yet. Oh Heauen! in this I your assistance craue, Punish the faulter, and the innocent saue. Iul. You are not true to your owne honour Father. To let me longer liue. Duke. Oh Iulia, Iulia, Thou hast ouerwhelm'd vpon my aged head Mountaines of griefe, t'oppresse me to my graue. Is Parma found? Str. My Lord, hee's priuately Fled from the Court. Duke. Then flye thou after villaine. Str. Sir, are you madde? Duke. What's to be done?

Conceale it then: wee'le study To salue thy honour, and to keepe thy loosenesse From all the world conceal'd, compresse thy griefe, And I will study how to shadow mine.

Moth. Oh misery beyond comparison! When saue the Heauens we haue no roofe at all To shelter vs. Clow. That word all Stickes more in my stomacke then my victuals can: For indeede wee can get none to eate now; I told you, you were so prodigall we should pinch for't. Wife What place may wee call this? what Clime? what Prouince? Clow. Why this is the Duke-dome of Florence, and this is the Forrest where the hard-hearted Duke hunts many a Hart: and there's no Deere so deare to him, but hee'le kill it: as goodly a large place to starue in, as your Ladiship can desire to see in a Summers day. Wife Yet here, since no man knowes vs, no man can Deride our misery: better dye staru'd, Then basely begge. Clow. How better starue then begge; all the Ladies of Florence shal neuer make me of that beleefe. I had rather beg a thousand times, then starue once, doe you scorne begging? Your betters doe not, no Madam; get me a Snap-sacke, I'le to Florence: I'le make all the high wayes ring of me with for the Lords sake. I haue studied a Prayer for him that giues, and a Poxe take him that giues nothing: I haue one for the Horse-way, another for the Foote-way, and a third for the turning-stile. No Madam, begging is growne a gentleman-like Calling here in our Countrey. Wife I haue yet one poore piece of Gold reseru'd, Step to the Village by and fetch some Wine. Clow. You had better keepe your Gold, and trust to my begging Oratory, yet this is the worst they can say to mee, that I am my Ladies Bottle-man. Exit Clowne. Wife Here's a strange change: we must be patient, Yet can I not but weepe thinking on thee. Lau. Madam on me? there is no change of Fortune Can puffe me or deiect me; I am all one In rich abundance and penurious want: So little doe my miseries vexe me, Or the faire Princesse wrong, that I will end My passions in a Song. A Song. Sound Hornes within. Wife It seemes the Duke is Hunting in the Forrest, Here let vs rest our selues, and listen to Their Tones, for nothing but mishap here lies; Sing thou faire Childe, I'le keepe tune with my eyes. Winde hornes. And enter the Prince of Florence &amp; Mounsieur. Prince This way the voyce was, let vs leaue the Chace. Moun. Behold my Lord two sad deiected Creatures Throwne on the humble verdure. Prince Hee's beauty mixt with teares, that pouerty Was neuer bred in Cottage: I'le farther question Their state and fortune. Wife Wee're discouered, Daughter arise. Prince What are you gentle Creatures? Nay answere not in teares. If you by casuall losse, or by the hand Of Fortune haue beene crusht beneath these sorrowes, He demands your griefe That hath as much will as ability To succour you, and for your owne faire sake; Nay beautious Damsell, you neede not question that. Lau. If by the front we may beleeue the heart, Or by the out-side iudge the inward vertue: You faire Sir, haue euen in your selfe alone All that this world can promise; for I ne're Beheld one so compleate; and were I sure Although you would not pitty, yet at least You would not mocke our misery: I would relate A Tale should make you weepe. Prince. Sweete if the Prologue To thy sad passion mooue thus: what will the Sceane And tragicke act it selfe doe? Is than Gentlewoman Your Mother sweete? Lau. My wretched Mother Sir. Prince. Pray of what Prouince? Lau. Milleine. Prince. What fortune there? Lau. My Father was a Noble Gentleman, Rank't with the best in Birth, and which did adde To all his other vertues, a bold Souldier; But when he dy'deâ Prince. Nay, proceede beauteous Lady, How was your Father stil'd? Lau. To tell you that, Were to exclaime vpon my Prince, my Countrey, And their Ingratitude: For he being dead, With him our fortunes and our hopes both fail'd; My Mother loath to liue ignobly base, Where once she flourisht, hauing spent her meanes Not loosely nor in riot, but in the honour Of her dead Husband: left th'ingratefull Land, Rather to spend her yeares in pouerty, Mongst those that neuer knew her height of Fortune, Then with her thankelesse Friends and Countrey-men, Fled here to perish. Prince. More then her Charming beauty Her passion moues me: where inhabit you? Lau. Here, euery where. Prince. Beneath these Trees? Lau. We haue No other roofe then what kinde Heauen lends. Prince. Gentle Creature, Had you not told me that your Birth was Noble, I should haue found it in your face and gesture. Mounsieur. Mounsieur My Lord. Prince Goe winde thy Horne abroad, and call to vs Some of our traine: we pitty these two Ladies, And we will raise their hope: Cheere you old Madam, You shall receiue some bounty from a Prince. Enter a Hunts-man. Who keepes the Lodge below? Hunts. Your Highnesse Hunts-man. Prince Command him to remoue, and instantly We giue it to these Ladies: besides, adde Vnto our Guest three thousand pounds a yeare: We'le see it furnisht too with Plate and Hangings. 'Las pretty Maide, your Father's dead you say, We'le take you now to our owne Patronage, And trust me Lady, while wee'ne Prince of Florence, You shall not want nor foode, nor harborage. Wife Pardon Great Sir, this our neglect of duty Vnto a Prince so gracious and compleate In vertuous indowments. Lau. To excuse Our former negligence, behold I cast Me at your foote. Prince Arise sweete, pray your name? Lau. Lauretta. Prince Faire Laurrett, you shall be henceforth ours, Oh Mounsieur! I ne're saw where I could loue Till now. Moun. How now my Lord, remember pray, What you are to this poore deiected Maide. Prince Well Mounsieur, well; when e're I match, pray Heauen, We loue so well: but loue and toyle hath made vs Euen somewhat thirsty, would we had some Wine. Enter Clowne. Clow. Nay, now I thinke I haue fitted you with a Cup of Nipsitato. Moun. How now sirrah, what are you? Clow. What am I? Nay what art thou? I thinke youle proue little better then a smell-smocke, That can finde out a pretty wench in such a Corner. Wife Peace sirrah, 'tis the Prince. Clow. What if he be? he may loue a Wench as well as another man. Prince What hast thou there? Clow. A bottle of Wine and a Manchet that my Lady sent me for. Prince Thou ne're couldst come to vs in better time, Reach it vs Mounsieur. Moun. Your bottle quickly sirrah, come I say. Clow. Yes, when? can you tell? doe you thinke I am such an Asse, to part so lightly with my liquor? Know thou my friend, before I could get this bottle fill'd, I was glad to change a piece of Gold, and call for the rest againe. And doe you thinke I'le loose my liquor, and haue no Gold nor rest againe? Not so my Friend, not so. Moun. There's Gold sir. Clow. Madam, will you giue me a Licence to sell VVine? I could get no Pirate in the Forrest but a woodden Dish. Wife Fill to the Prince Lauretta. Lau. Will it please Your Highnesse drinke out of a woodden Mazer? Prince Yes sweete with thee in any thing: you know Wee are a Prince, and you shall be our taster. Lau. Why should I loue this Prince? his bounteous gifts Exalt me not, but make me much more poore, I'me more deiected then I was before. Wife Sir. Moun. Lady, thankes: I feare me he is caught, But if he be, my Counsell must diuert him. Clow. The bottome of the bottle is at your seruice Sir, Shall you and I part stakes? Moun. There's more Gold for you. Clow. I had rather you had broke my pate then my draught, but harke you Sir, are you as a man should say, a belonger to? Hunt. A belonger to? what's that sir? Clow. Oh ignorant! are you a follower? Hunt. I seldome goe before when my betters are in place. Clow. A Seruing-man I take it. Hunt. Right sir. Clow. I desire you the more complement: I haue the courtesie of the Forrest for you. Hunt. And I haue the courtesie of the Court for you sir. Clow. That's to bring me to the Buttery hatch, and neuer make me drinke. Prince Sirrah, conduct those Ladies to the Lodge, And tell the Keeper we haue stor'd for him, A better fortune; you shall heare further from vs, You vsher them. Hunt. Come Ladies will you walke? Clow. How now sawce-boxe, know your manners: was not I Gentleman vsher before you came? Am not I hee that did the bottle bring? Come Ladies follow me. Exit Clowne with Ladies, with Huntsman. Moun. Your purpose Sir, is to loue this Lady, And hazard all your hopes. Prince Oh gentle Friend, Why was I borne high? but to raise their hopes That are deiected: so much for my bounty. Moun. But for your loue. Prince It is with no intent To make the Maide my wife, because I know Her fortunes cannot equall mine. Moun. Then 'twere more dishonorable To strumpet her. Prince Still thou mistak'st, mine Is honourable loue, and built on vertue; Nor would I for the Emperours Diademe, Corrupt her whom I loue. Moun. Braue Prince I'me glad That ere I kept thy Company. Prince Come Mounsieur, night steales on, not many yeares Shall passe me, but I purpose to reuisite This my new Mistresse, my auspicious fate To thee my happy loue I consecrate. Exeunt. A Dumbe show. Enter the Duke of Milleins, a Midwife with a young Childe, and after them Stroza: the Duke shewes the Childe to Stroza, hee takes it: then the Duke sweares them both to secrecy vpon his Sword, and exit with the Midwife: then Stroza goes to hide it, and Parma dogs him: when hee hath laide the Childe in a Corner, he departs in haste, and Parma takes vp the Childe, and speakes. Par. Thou shouldst be mine: and durst I for my Head Euen in the open Court I'de challenge thee, But I haue so incenst th'offended Duke, And layd such heauy spots vpon her head, I cannot doo't with safety: methinkes this Child Doth looke me in the face, as if 'twould call Me Father, and but this suspected Stroza Stuft my too credulous eares with iealousies. For thee sweete Babe I'le sweare, that if not all, Part of my blood runnes in thy tender veynes, For those few drops I will not see the perish; Be it for her sake whom once I lou'd, And shall doe euer: Oh iniurious Stroza! I now begin to feare; for this sweete Babe Hath in his face no bastardy, but shewes A Princely semblance: but Stroza and the Duke, This will I keepe as charie as her honour, The which I prize aboue the Vniuerse. Though she were forc't to be vnnaturall, I'le take to me this Infants pupillage; Nor yet resolu'd, till I a way haue found To make that perfect which is yet vnsound. Exit.

Milleine Forbeare my Lords for a few priuate words: Faire Daughter, wee'le not chide you farther now, Nor adde vnto your blushes: by our rude Reproofes your faults are couered with these your sighes, Since all your fire of lust is quencht in ashes. Iul. Durst I presume my Lord, to know Whither you haue sent my sonne? Mil. I'le not haue it question'd. I striue to salue thy honour, and thou seek'st To publish thy disgrace: my study is Where I may picke thee out a noble Husband, To shadow these dishonours, and keepe thee From the like scandall. Iul.

What, and suspectlesse? Str. Vnlesse the silent Groue of Trees should blabe, There is no feare of scandall, mantled close, I left the sucking Babe where the next passenger Must finde it needes, and so it hapned for Some two yeares after, Passing that way to know where 'twas become, 'Twas gone, and by some courteous hand I hope Remou'd to gentle fosterage.

Now euery begger comes vpon me with good Gentleman, good Gentleman: when yesterday Gentlemen would haue shun'd the way for feare I should haue begg'd of them. Then comes another vpon mee with good your Worship, good your Worship, then doe I double my fyles, and cast him a single two-pence. Hunt. Sirrah, thou may'st thanke the Prince for this. Clow.

Sir, because that little I haue, Might doe you good: I would you had No, money, nay, no meanes: but I speake idly, Pray pardon me my Lord. Prince. By all my hopes I haue in Florence, would thou wert a Dutchesse, That I might court thee vpon equall tearmes; Or that I were of low deiected fortunes, To ranke with thee in Birth: for to enioy Thy beauty, were a greater Dowre then Florence Great Duke-dome.

But which my Lord counts most, is a faire League 'Twixt your diuided Duke-domes. Florence We doe conceite you: But for the Dowre you craue? Str. Ten thousand Crownes By th'yeare. Flo.

In these armes My Lord, you are Sanctuared. Parm. I doe not doubt it: But I pray you tell me, since I left the Court, How is my absence taken? Lord. Of the Duke, With much distaste. Parm. But of the Princesse Iulia? Lord Full two Moneths Shee kept her Chamber, grieuously distracted, They say, meere griefe for your departure hence. Parm. Brauely manag'd, The Duke I see was more kind to her fame, Then to his prettie grand-childe; well Ile salt it all, But what thinke you if after all I should Send Letters to her, or Ambassadors? I should not win her, for I know Th'aue her heart in bondage. Lord Why worthy Prince, Haue you not heard the newes: Shee hath beene offered Vnto the Florentine, the match accepted, And the Nuptiall day the tenth of the next Moneth. Parm. No more: Pray leaue mee Sir. Lord. I will: Pray Sir Regard your safety. Exit Lord. Parm. To bee married, Ruimus in vestitum semper, I did neglect her, but being deni'd, I doate vpon her beautie: Methinkes 'tis fit, If I begot the Child?

Enter the Prince and Mounsieur. Clowne If you will not beleeue mee, will you beleeue these? Lauret. Welcome my Lord: And wherefore doe you sigh? Prince I sigh Lauretta, cause I cannot chuse. Lauret.

You blam'd mee now for sighing: Why doe you melt in teares? Sweet what's the cause? Lauret. Nay, nothing.

Prince Looke to her safety, not for the Crowne Of Florence I would haue her perish. Wife Helpe to support her. Exit with Mother and Clowne.

Moun. Fled my Lord. Prince Poast after; bring him backe, Could hee not set his hand to 'tâ How now, the newes? Moun. Hee's fled vpon a milke white Gennet Sir, Seeming t'outstrip the winde, and Iâlost him. Prince Thou hast lost mee quite. Moun. What meanes this passions Sir? Prince Mounsieur reade there, What will confound thee: Oh if shee bee vnchast! Could they find none but mee to worke vpon. Moun. It confounds mee my Lord. Prince If shee bee Chast, How shall I wrong her, to question her faire Vertues? Moun. Right. Prince But if shee bee not right? I wrong my Honor, Which after marriage, how shall I recall? Moun. 'Tis certaine. Prince Yes: Oh how am I perplext! Come, Ile to Court, Ile not bee sway'd: Were shee a Potent Queene, Where Counsell fayles mee, Ile once trust to spleene. Exeunt. Enter the Clowne with his Table-bookes. Clowne. Let me see, the Prince is to bee married to morrow, and my young Mistris meanes to keepe a Feast in the Forrest, in honour of his wedding at the Court: Now am I sent as Caterer into the City to prouide them victualls, which they charg'd me to buy; no ordinary fare, no more it shall, and therefore I haue cast it thus; First and foremost, wee will haueâ(yes downe it shall) we will haue a Gammon of Bacon roasted, and stufft with Oysters; And sixe Black-Puddings to bee serued vp in Sorrell-sops; A pickell'd shoulder of Mutton, and a surloyne of Beefe in White-broth, so much for the first course. Now, for the second, we will haue a Cherry-Tart cut into Rashers and broyled; A Custard Carbonado'd on the coales; A liue Eele swimming in clowted Creame; And sixe Sheepes-heads baked, with the hornes peering out of the pasty-crust. The morrall is, because it is a wedding dinner. Enter Stroza with another Lord. Stro. The ioyfull day's to morrow. Passe this plunge And we are made for euer. Clowne. What, my old Polititian? hee that vndermin'd my old Lady and my yong Mistris? now that I could find but one stratagem to blow him vp; I would tosse him, I would blanket him i'th Ayre, and make him cut an Italian caper in the Clouds: These Polititians can doe more execution with a pen, in their studies, then a good Souldier with his sword in the field, but he hath spi'd mee. Stro. Thee friend I should haue knowne? Clowne. And you too, I should haue knowne, but whether for a friend, or no, ther's the question? Stro. Thou seru'st the Generall Sforsa. Clow. I confesse it; but whether you haue seru'd him well, or no, there hangs a Tale. Stro. How doth thy noble Lady, faire Lauretta? They haue left Millaine long, reside they here Neere to the City Florence? Clow. Some three miles off, here in the Forrest, not halfe an houres riding. Stro. I pray thee recommend me to them both, And say, It shall goe hard with mine affaires But Ile find season'd houres to visit them. Clow. You shall not want directions to find the place, come when you will, you shall be most heartilyâpoyson'd. Stro. Tell them, The newes that they are well Is wondrous pleasing to me, and that power I haue in Millaine is reseru'd for them, To worke them into grace: I can but smile, To see how close I haue plotted their exile. Now businesse calls me hence: farewell. Exit. Clow. And behang'd, Mounsieur Stroza, whose description My Muse hath included in these few lines; Stroza, Thy Head is of a comely Block, And would shew well, crown'd with the combe of Cock: His Face an Inne, his Brow a sluttish Roome, His Nose the Chamberlaine, his Beard the Broome, Or like New-market Heath, that makes theeues rich, In which his Mouth stands iust like Deuills-ditch. And so farewell to your worship, graue Mounsieur Stroza, For I must about my market. Exeunt.</field>

Stro. Now see your errour, What better; safer, or more sweete reuenge, Then with the Husband? what more could woman aske? Lauret. My blood rebells against my reason, and I no way can withstand it: 'Tis not the Gold Mooues mee, but that deere loue I beare the Prince, Makes me neglect the credit and the honour Of my deare Fathers house: Sir, what the Duke desires I am resolued to doe his vtmost will. Wife. Oh my deare daughter. Lauret. Good Mother speake not, for my word is past, And cannot bee recall'd, Sir will you away? I am resolute. Stro. Shee yeeldes vnto her shame; which makes me blest, Let Millions fall, so I bee crown'd with rest. Wife. Oh mee, vnhappie, that nere knew griefe till now. Exeunt. Musicke. A Dumbe Shew.

Millaine should know, were it my case my Lord, A better Prince then hee should not wrong me. Prin. I haue bethought already how to beare mee; This Charter and this Ring, faire Loue, keepe you; And when I send for you, you shall repaire Vnto the Court: This all I shall inioyne you. Lauret. Great Sir, I shall. Prin. Come Mounsieur, now 'tis cast, Reuenge neere rules, so it be found at last. Exeunt omnes. Enter the two Dukes with Iulia, Stroza and attendants. Milla. Who saw the Prince last? Is't a custome with him To rise thus early? Floren. Sir, hee neuer sleepes Longer then th'day, nor keepes his bed by Sunne: 'Tis not the loue of the fairest Lady liues, Can make him leaue his morning exercise. Iulia. He neuer exercis'd with me, I'm sure; I might haue layne as safe, free, and vntoucht, By any Lady liuing. Enter the Prince and Mounsi. Prince. Pardon Lords, I haue stay'd you long, your blessing royall Father. My custome is, euer to rise before A womans houre: Now heare me speake my Lords, I'm married to a Lady, whose chaste honour, Reports and false Suggestions, did inforce me To call in publike question; but that we leaue Vnto our last nights rest. Stro. True my good Lord; But did you find me faulty? Prin. I doe protest, my Lords, I bosom'd with As true and chaste a Virgin, as ere lodg'd Within a Princes armes; All this I vow As I am Royall. Str. All's well my Lord? Milla. All's excellent Stroza. Prin. Now for an ends and publike satisfaction, For the foule wrong I did her, questioning Her Vertue, Ile confirme her dowre, and that Before I eate: Sweet Lady, reach the Charter I gaue you last night, 'fore you were full mine? Iulia. I receiu'd none Sir. Prin. Sweet, will you tel mee that? With which you did receiue a Ring the Duke My father gaue me. Iulia. When? Prince. Last night. Iulia. Where? Prince. In your Bed. Iulia. 'Twas in my dreame then. Prince. Being broad awake. Stro. I like not this: I smell a Rat. Milla. Stroza, I feare too. Stro. Brazen sore-head, Wilt Thou leaue now: 'Tis true my Lord. You did Receiue them both, Haue you forgot sweet Lady, This very morning, that you gaue them both To me? The Princesse ieasted, to see how You woo'd but take it. Moun. Excellent Villaine! Prince. 'Twas well put off: 'Tis strange shee's so forgetfull: I prethee Stroza Where are they? Stro. Where are they? they areâ Prince. Where? Why studdy you? Stro. They are thereâ Prince. Where man? Stro. I poasted them To Millaine, sent them safe, dare you not trust my word Prince. Not till I see my deeds. Stro. By one oth' Princes Traine. Prince. See which of the Traine is wanting. Moun. I shall my Lord. Stro. I would I were in Turkey. Milla. Would I were on horse-backe. Prin. Nay, looke not you deiected beautious Bride, For this is done onely to honour you. Enter a Seruing-man with a child in a couered Dish. Gent. The Prince, my Master, hearing your solemnities, Hath sent this dish, to adde a present to Your royall Feasts, wishing himselfe therein To be a wellcome guest. Prince. Your Masters name? Gent. Prince Parma. Prince. Giue this Gentleman A 100. crownes: This will much grace our banquet. Flo. Ther's in that dish, some Morrall. Milla. Comming from him, Meethinks it should be season'd with some strange And dangerous poyson: Touch't not, my Lord. Flo. There should be more in't, then a feasting dish; What's here, a Child? Iulia. Oh my perplexed heart! Pri. Vpon his brest ther's something writ, Ile read it. 'Tis fit, if Iustice bee not quite exil'd That he that wedds the mother, keepe the child. This Child was sent to me. Stro. From whom? whom, Parma? breake the bastards necke, As I would doe the Fathers, were hee here. Prin. Sure spare't for the Mothers sake; t'was sent to vs: Which of the trayne is wanting? Enter Mounsieur. Moun. None my Lord. Prin. Stroza, where is this Charter and the Ring? Stro. I know of none. Moun. Why, t'was confest. Stro. Right, I confest it; but your grace must know, 'Twas but to please your humour, which began To grow into some violence. Moun. I can forbeare no longer; Impudent Stroza, Thou art a Villaine, periur'd, and forsworne: That Duke dishonourable; and shee vnchast: Besides, thou hyredst a Virgin in her roome; (Slaue as thou art) to bosome with the Prince; Gau'st her fiue hundred Crownes. That this is true, I will maintaine by combat. Stro. That I did this? Hee lies below his entrayles. That dares to braue mee with such a proud affront: And in the honour of my Prince and Countrey I will approoue thee recreant. Prin. A strife, that nought saue combat can deside. The cause so full of doubts, and intricate. Soe, they are both arm'd, and euenly, without odds, Saue what the iustice of the cause can yeeld. Exit Mounsieur and Stroza. Enter Prince Parma. Par. Bee't no intrusion held, if a strange Prince (Setting behind, all complementall leaue) Amongst strange Princes enters: Let me know Which is the Prince of Florence? Prince Wee are hee. Parm. And Parma? Iuli. Parma? Prince Excuse mee Sir, I know him not: But if I much mistake not, Wee are late indebted to you for a present. Parm. It was a gift, I should bee loath to part with, But vpon good conditions. Am I then To all a stranger: Doe you not know mee Lady? Milla. Heare him not speake, I charge thee by thine honor? Prince. Parma speake, and if thy speech was bent to mee? Parm. Ere I proceede, let mee behold this babe; Nere a Nurse heere? Pray hand it you sweete Lady, Till I find out a Mother. Milla. Touch it not, I charge thee on my blessing. Iulia Pardon Sir, It well becomes my handling. Prince. Parma proceede. Parm. Then Florence know, thou hast wrong'd me beyond, thought; Shipwrackt my Honour, and my Fame; nay strumpeted Her, whom I tearme my Bride. Prince 'Tis false, I neuer imbrac'd saue with one, And her, I found to bee most truely chast. Parm. Then It maintaine: Hast thou a Wife heere? Prince Yes. Parm. Then Ile approoue her to bee none of thine, That thou hast fetch't her from anothers armes. Nay more, that shee's vnchast? Prin. Know Parma, thou hast kindled such a Flame, That all the Oceans billowes scarce can quench: Bee that our quarrells ground. Florence Princes, forbeare: First see the Issue of the former Combat, Before more blood you hazard. Prince Wee are pleased. Parm. And wee content. Enter Stroza and the Mounsieur, they fight, and Stroza is ouercome. Moun. Yeeld thy selfe recreant villaine, or thou dy'st. Stro. Saue mee, I will confesse; Is Parma heere? Parm. Yes, heere wee are. Stro. I falsely stuft thy head with Iealousies, And for some priuate ends of my reuenge, Disgrac'd the Generall, and set odds betwixt Lauretta and the Princesse: All these mischiefes Proceede from my suggestions. Milla. Damne him for it. Stro. Is that your kindnesse? Giue me leaue to liue. Bee't but to taynt his honour. Prince Tell mee Stroza, Was Iulia chaste? Stro. No. Prince Did her Father know it? Stro. Yes, and more too: I had the Gold from him, To bribe the Generalls daughter. Florence Iniuries, Beyond the thought of man. Milla. Which wee 'le no longer striue with, since the heauens haue laid that ope most plaine and palpable, which most wee thought to conceale. Prince. Will Parma fight? Parm. Resolue mee first? Was Iulia found Chast? Prince. I heere protest, wee parted both, as cleere, As at our first encounter. Parm. Then I accept her, If you my Lord Bee pleas'd so to part with her. Prince. Willingly. Iulia. Now haue I my desires: Had I withall, The Princely babe I boare. Parm. See Iulia, Whom thy hard-hearted Father doom'd to death. My care hath still Conserued, Imbrace it Lady; Nay, 'tis thy owne nere feare it. Prince. Then Prince Parma, With your words Ile proceed. 'Tis fit all Iustice bee not quite exil'd, That hee that wedds the Mother keepe the child. Florence But Peeres, the Virgin that this Stroza hired To Iustifie these wrongs? Prince At hand my Lord: Mounsieur conduct them hither? Moun. I shall Sir. Milla. The Generalls Wife and Daughter. Enter Lauretta, Wife, and Clowne. Clow. Yes and their man too; all that's left of him. Prince This the Maide, To whom I am so bound? Laure. Oh let me lie As prostrate at your foot in Vassallage, As I was at your pleasure. Prince Sweete arise. Clow. Your Lordship hath bin vp already, when shee was downe: I hope if the thing you wott of goe no worse forward then it hath hegun, and that you take charge of my young Lady, you neede not bee altogether vnmindfull of her Gentleman-Vsher. Florence. Of what birth is that Lady? Milla. Euen the least Enuy can speake, Shee is a Souldiers Daughter, Decended from a noble parentage. Wife. Who with her mother, Thus kneeles to him, as to their Soueraigne. Intreating, grace and pittie. Milla. You haue both: Sure, sure, the heauens for our Ingratitude, To noble Sforza, onr braue generall, Hath thus crost our proceedings: which to recompence, Wee'le take you vnto our best patronage. Wife. Millaine is honorable. Prince But by your fauour Sir, This must bee our owne charge. Florence With which we are pleas'd. Iulia. Stroza was cause of all, but his submission Hath sau'd him from our hate, arise in grace. Whil'st we thus greete Lauretta. Lauret. Royall Princesse, I still shall be your hand-maide. Stroza Who would striue, To bee a villaine, when the good thus thriue? Prince You crowne me with your wishes, Royall father; My Mistris first, and next my bed-fellow, And now my Bride most welcome. Excellent Sir, Imbrace the Millaine Duke, whil'st I change hand with Princely Parma; Iulia, once my Wife? Backe to your husband I returne you chast: Mounsieur, bee still our friend: You our kind Mother: And let succeeding Ages, thus much say: Never was Maiden-head better giuen away. Exeunt omnes.
