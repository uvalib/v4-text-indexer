      <field name="fulltext">Divesne Prisco natus ab Inacho, Nil interest, an Pauper, &amp; infima De gente sub dio moreris, Victima nil miserantis Orci? Horat. Lib. 2. Ode 3.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The LADY Katherine Herbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Forget how you were serv'd last time, and pray Be kind this onceâ T'a modest Prologue and a modest Play, Dreading your anger poor deluded Tray Has slip'd his Collar, and is run away. Jo. Haynes himself, that shew'd us this dog trick Has left us all of our displeasure sick, To th'Ladies now the Author by me speaks, A just admirer of your gallant Sex; He is your Poet, and a Lover too, For chiefly he design'd this Play for you; If you can find but in it Love or Wit, He vowes he can out love what he has writ: Bids me remember e're you be displeas'd, How with Cassandra's fam'd Romance ye were pleas'd; How many nights 't has kept you long awake, Nay and have wept for Oroondates sake. When so good natur'd to him, but in thought, Be but so kind where he himself has brought. For your new Poet next I must implore; Dash not his hopes of this on any score; For if you doâ He is so modest he will write no more. Disperse the stormes with your fair smiles and eyes, That from the rage of Blustring Criticks rise; And as the Tempest gathers in the Pit Let the bright Boxes beams then scatter it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Persons Represented. Alexander the Great. Ephestion a Youth extreamly belov'd by him. Lysimachus Great Captain. Cassander Great Captain. Phillip Great Captain.

      <field name="fulltext">The Scene Babylon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter as newly arriv'd Lysimachus, Cassander, Officers, and attendance, in State. Lys. From Ganges, and beyond Nyle's secret Bed, Strange conquer'd Nations have Euphrates spread, By Heavens eternal Power, ordain'd to meet In the Worlds center, and it's Royal Seat. From other Parts whilest succours bend their course, You bring from Greece, the Foot to re-inforce, And I from Thrace, five thousand Winged Horse. So the great Sea maintains it's swelling Pride By lesser streams, that thither daily glide; All things contribute to this mighty King, To Alexander flowing, leave their Spring, And Aids from the remotest Places bring. Cas. We but appear like Day break after Night, Where e're He comes, he fills the Skye with light. So the base Moon does oft Eclipse the Sun, And shade that Beauty, whence her light begun. He sends us forth, like Nylus in a Floud, To drown the World, and Court him with the good. Lys. Fill'd with success, he is luxurious grown, And gluts with Blood, his cruel wanton Throne. The News you tell me of Phylotas Death, If true, who after him can hope for breath? Is't possible! Repeat it yet againâ Ye Gods! The Son of bold Parmenio slain! Cas. This News, the Great Parmenio as a Friend, T'Antipater my Father did commend: His fault was, he did Dymnus treason hide, So that for that he ne're believ'd he Dy'd. Lys. Of Dymnus fond conspiracy, I've heard, But never thought Phylotas so deserv'd. Cas. Had that been sought, Phylotas might have stood, Till his known Innocence had sav'd his Blood; But what bold Creature in the Forrest dare With the stout Lyon in his Hunting share? His Generals, Friends, and all Obnoxious stand, To be pick'd out for Death at his Command; But for my Sufferings, more than Death I grieve; In my lost Fame, he buried me alive: You and the World did witness my disgrace, When that base blow he struck me on the Face, I wish that I had Dy'd in Clytus place; I Travel with the Weightâ Lys. Cassander holdâ You were too blame, and Clytus was too bold. Cas. Have done Lysimachus, there is a smother'd shame, When thus fomented breaks into a flame; I had a Thunder-Bolt as well withstood, And cherish'd lightning in my vital blood. Enter to them Bagistanes. Bag. Fresh News o'retake the former on the way, And all confirm the King will come to day. Shrill joyful Clamours, which the Clouds involve, Peirce through the Air, and o're our Heads dissolve, And near Euphrates, all their Trumpets sound, Slide down the stream, and from our Walls rebound. Lys. The News is great, and welcome that we hear. Bag. But o're our Sun does a thick Cloud appear, That makes his glorious body shine less clear. As oft in multitudes of Shouts ascend A loud and goodly noise, till at the end, Some single voice behind, does stagging lye, And Robs the whole, of it's full harmony.â Lys. I interrupt youâIs the King in healthâ? Bag. He is, but he ha's lost his greatest wealth, A treasure, that the Gods did envy him. Lys. If that be all, he will be rich again. Bag. Ah, but this loss, he never will redeem.â The Gen'ral of the World, Parmenio's slain. Lys. Parmenio dead!â Cas. What slain! By what bold man? Bag. By that bold Man, that only dares, and can. Lys. Does Alexander thus transplant, to save His fading Lawrels on Parmenio's Grave? We'rt thou the Son of Philip, not of Jove, Thou hadst not thrown away this Token of his Love, Nor hadst thy self of so much Power bereft, With thy right Arm to have cut off thy left. Cas. A man so great, that in his Fathers time, Winning too many Battels was his Crime. Bag. His trusty slave, who by this Act is freed, Is hither come, that saw Parmenio bleed, In his own Garden, where he us'd to breath Pure Air for Life, he trod the paths of Death. Four of the Guard the Gen'ral thus salute, Hail mighty Captain, and of most repute; The Monarch of the World, these Letters sends To great Parmenio, his best of Friends. The good Old man, so much o'rejoy'd to see His Masters Love, receiv'd e'm on his Knee. Seal'd with his Blood, which he unkowing Tore, Giving the Murderers sign to let out more: Those but suppli'd their Masters will in part, The rest they did ingrave upon his Heart, Which with a dagger from his breast they drein'd, And all with Blood the Treacherous paper stain'd. The Ink, the colour of that black design, Blush'd that it did in such a Treason joyn: Thus the bold Lyon taken by surprize, Was like a Lamb offer'd to sacrifice. Cas. Why do ye Gods of Mans misfortunes boast? And make us Heroes at our own lives cost. Th'extreamest height in which we hope to live Is but of Honours breath an empty Sound, Or like a Star, one sudden shoot we give, Then fall an empty Vapour on the Ground. Ingrateful Alexander, has now repaid Those many Fights, ne're won but by his Aid. Lys. Forbear Cassander, you o're reach your Sence, Whom the Gods own, pay him obedience. How blest were Thousands such as Thee and I, To be his steps to mount on Victory! You might, but Bagistanes not have known, When Philip to augment the Gods was gone, The Grecian Cities did with Joy depend, That with his life their bondage shoul'd have end, And to the Oracle of Delphos send; Where in a rage th'auspitious God reply'd, Urge not to know, what's to your fate deny'd, A greater far than Philip yet remains, Whose godlike arm shall hold the World in Chains. Cass. Were he a God he should have kept his Seat, Not grieve the World with his immortal weight. He from the Gods is like a Fury hurld, To glut their anger on the ravish'd World: Lys. Cease, You neglect the duty of your place.â Haste, and draw out the Horse I brought from Thrace, And Macedonian foot, which you obey, And with your armed Ranks inclose the way; Guard every path, where the Worlds Favourite comes. Fly high your standards, and provoke your drums. Exit. Cassander. But e're you go I'le to your breast impart A Story of which no Mortal bears a part to Bagist. But that bright Excellence of all my heart. You know my Princess to whose charmes I owe The purest love, Ith' strangest manner too; A birth so strange beyond the reach of Fame. Bag. I long to hear, that I may know her name. Lys. In the last fight in which the stronger side The World arraign'd, and in that Battle try'd; When Victory half glutted with the dead, Whetted her Rage again on those that fled: Aloft she led us where she laid her Brood, O're hills of Heroes, and through Seas of blood; At last, as proud that she had seiz'd the Prey, Flew still before us, and proclaim'd the day. Bag. Too well I knew, what that days Act can boast, The Fame you won, and what Darius lost. Lys. The Battle done, by Alexander sent, I to Darius rich Pavilion went. Who like a Merchant in a storme of Sea, To save his Life had thrown his Crown away, And all his riches both of love and power, Strew'd in the way to stop the Conquerour. But oh misfortune! I too early came, And found the Tent abandon'd in a flame, Gaz'd on by Beauties, that with mournful Cryes, Call'd Parisatis! O ye Gods! She dies! I heard no more, but like a whirlwind brush'd The flakes away, and through the Flames I rush'd, Where I beheld this Goddess on the floor, Yielding to flames, that did her eyes adore, In a dark swoond, and yet her form so bright, Her glorious beauty dazel'd all the light. I took this sacred burthen in one arm, And with the other scattered every harm; The Fire recoil'd, and hung upon the wall, Bowing its conquer'd head, and down did fall: Like the bright Taper, it did soon decay, That lost its splendor at the sight of day. Bag. What then you Gods, did you of her decree? Lys. Ask not of her, but what became of me? Thus, big with all the treasure of the Earth, I blest her Mother with her second Birth. Surpris'd at this, she then with joy did weep, And call'd her senses back from deadly sleep; As from behind a Cloud the Sun displayes, And kills the sight with unexpected rayes, So from this cloud of death her Spirits stole, And through her eyes they shot into my Soul. My Passions tale, I had not time to say, Nor she her sense of gratitude to pay. For Alexander, like a storm did come, And bore me off, when I was ne're at home. The rest you knowâ When he Statira to himself has joyn'd, She for his lov'd Ephestion is design'd: Judge then, when such a Rival I persue, If I han't need of such a Friend as you. Enter to them Parisatis and Melanthe: attended. Bag. You shall command me, while I have a heartâ Lys. See where she comes that makes my Manhood start, The fairest object in the World, I fear. Par. Lysimachus, with Bagistanes here! [aside. The News is great, that sayes our glorious Sun This day lights in the King of Macedon.â My Sister, Bagistanes, thinks it fit, You'd see her e're you Alexander meet. Bag. I'le haste, and pay my duty at her feet. [Exit Bagistanes. Par. I am surpris'd; I know not what to say, I'me loath to go, and yet I should not stay. [Aside. Forgive me, Sir, to whom I so much owe, My blushes hide the gratitude I'de show, Y're welcome and with joy my bosome fill, But welcome to Darius Daughter still. [Offers to go off. Lys. Stay, Noble Princess, stay, my life to save; I have no merits, but to be your slave; [Kneels. Thus I entreat, and I cou'd do no more, If you your Fathers Crown, and Titles wore. Thus as a Saint does to the Altar bow. Par. Rise, Gallant Souldier, and I'le hear you now. Since you Lysimachus so much have done, I cannot but some gentle pity own, And yet 'twere better, I that death had dy'd, Than in my Fathers ruin to divide.â Talk any thing, but let me beg you then Talk not of Love, when I must chide agen. Lys. How doubly wretched was my Love that time, Which up to you did on your ruin climb; Then shew'd you that which you had dy'd to shun, How we Darius Crown and Kingdomes won. What more to plague me could my Fate have done! Well may you then that fatal love despise, That sav'd your life for Alexanders prize. Par. Lysimachus, I blame not what you did, But I cou'd wish you wou'd your Passion hide. Cou'd I Darius life but call again, With all the Pompe and glory of his Reign, I would your love before a Kings possess, And with a Crown creat your happiness; But of a Pris'ner never this require, She'd make you happier than you cou'd aspire; And since the Gods have so restrain'd my hand, In Alexanders chains I more demand, Than if all Persia were at my command. Lys. The Crown you mean you wont go far to take; 'Twill be brought to you for Ephestion's sake. When Alexander all the World shall lead, A Present to Statira's Nuptial Bed, He'le scorn in single happiness to live, But will her Sister to Ephestion give; And then to make your happiness the more, He will all Persia to your wish restore. Par. His proferr'd Kingdomes I should then despise, And scorn to take them, though at any Price; The Worlds too little to be giv'n to me, Unless presented, as my mind is, free. Though with that off'ring I a God should lose, A blessing so impos'd I would refuse. Lys. If not a God, he's of such flesh and blood Would tempt a Goddess to be soft and good, Adorn'd like Summer, and so blushing gay, In April youth, with Cheeks like blooming May. All the day long he'l bless you with his sight, And like the Hony-Suckle breath at night. Par. This beauteous Animal, so like the Spring Will soon, like that, decay, and Winter bringâ I should be loth he should my hopes beguile, And tarry with me but a Summers while, Let Gods possess his heavenly beauty then; We Women only were ordain'd for men. Lys. You've said enough to shew your noble mind; Yet greatest Courages may be confin'd. What will you do in that unlucky hour Of this Mans Love, and Alexanders Power? When you are lifted up to such a hight, I shew so little almost out of sight. Par. Now y'are too blame Lysimacus. For know, That Parisatis, though she be so low; Yet every thing's too mean for her desire, And then her self she can't be lifted higher. I ne're shall from my constant temper fly, Unless to loose the knot your jealousie wou'd tie.â Begone, begone,âI'le hear no more to day; I think too well of you to let you stay: Seek not for Love, where he in private lies. For he has wings, and then away he flies.â Haste, meet the Conquerour.â Lys. I go, I goâ And all obedience to your will I'le shew. [Exit Lysimachus. Par. Chide me, Melanthe, Art not thou afraid, That I to shew my thanks too much have said; And yet my forward gratitude I chide, For fear a Love should under it lie hid. At this admir'd example thou wert by, When others fled, and with me chose to die. Mel. Had you but seen with what a gust 'e came; How like a God he chas'd away the flame; You would have thought him after all was lost, Darius Genius, or his happy Ghost. Par. Yet he was forc'd, by honour carry'd on, Which e're destroy'd ten thousand would have done. To some great Spirits Fortune is unkind, To hide occasions they would gladly find; My safety by the Powers above was meant, He first i'th' way, was on the errand sent. [Enter to them Araxis. Good Gods! Is it Araxis I behold! How came you hither? How were ye so bold? Arax. Ask not, since I am Oroondates slave, The greatest Lover, and of men most brave: What is there, but a man like him can do, Inspir'd with Love, and so much valour too? Rouz'd with the Noise that Alexander brings, Away his fears like drowzy thoughts he flings: Awake Araxis say's he; let us haste, And pay this visit, which may be our last. The Worlds my Rival, and with glittering shew, Does at Statira's Feet in triumph bow. We 'rose, and soon deceiv'd the Watchful throng, Saying we did to some Ambassadour belong; Then to the Garden, hurri'd by his flame, I, and the Prince, the best of Lovers came; He like a Noble Deer that long had pin'd In Sandy Plains, but cou'd no Water find; Till seeing a wanton stream through Meadowes play, O're Gaps, and hedges thither makes his way: Thus ne're a Fountain sate this Lover down, The which Statira's Window seem'd to Crown: Blest stream, sai's he (and then his Tears ran o're, Like drops of Pearl upon the Christal shore) If my Statira of thy saltness hears, Ah tell her, it was Oroondates tears.â [Enter to them Oroondates. See where this wretched Lover comes.â Par. 'Tis he!â I am amaz'd at what you told, and what I see. Oroon. The Sun approaches, and a plot hath laid To cover Oroondates with his shade, And when his glories with your beauties joyn, You and Statira in his Court shall shine. Not see me first! I have the cause admir'd, And have the reason of the Gods requir'd: Ah whither is my angry Queen retir'd? Par. Oh stay not; Alexanders Trumpets sound, hast Oroondates, 'tis forbidden Ground. Oroon. Let Cowards tremble at his mighty voice; My brain's too steddy to be turn'd with noise: No earth is hurtful that she's pleas'd to grace; I'de run to meet her though in any place; On any ground where Alexander trod, And dare behold him, were he twice a God. Par. Brave man, whose fault is, that thy soul's too great, That scorning fear, neglects it's mortal seat, And whilest your lofty spirit soars too high, Views not the Precepice beneath your eye. Look back, from this unhappy place remove; Haste, and preserve the greatest stock of Love. Oroon. I cannot till she does my burthen light; My Loves so great, I stagger with the weight. Par. You stay too long, and do your fate suborn. Oroon. I have no fate; no threatning but her scorn. Par. Shoul'd I but let Statira know ye'are here, You wou'd be threatned by the scorn you fear; To save your Life, she wou'd with Love debate, And rather be unkind to you, then to your fate. Oroon. Ah gentle half of my much better part, She cannot end my Life with greater smart: To wrack me thus! 'twere better I shou'd try Ten thousand deaths, than alwayes thus to dye: If she won't see me now the Skye is clear, What will she do when thickening Clouds appear? When Alexander Thunders with his Drums; Where will she find me when that Torrent comes? Par. The Guards are set, and Bagistanes gone; She cannot now be seen with you alone. If she obey the dictates of her mind, She soon will see you in a garb that's kind:â Go best of men, I dare no more be seen. [offers to go off. Oroon. Stay charming Sister of my beauteous Queenâ If you go to her, tell her, I am driv'n By Alexander from my blessed Heaven, And to the bottome of despair decline; We too can ne're in one Horizon shine; There like the Sun, I'le lay me down at Night, And drown in sorrowes all my past delight.â Tell her, some God, whiles slumber seals her Eyes, How pittifully Oroondates, lies; That in kind feeling of the Tears I shed, She come like Thetis to my wat'ry Bed. Par. All this, and more, my Tears from Yours shall plead. [Exeunt Parisatis and Melanthe. Oroon. The Gods renoun your Charitable deed. Araxis, come, my hopes of this dayes Fate, The business of my Life and Soul create. Arax. Let's watch it then, and mingle with the shew; Hid in the Croud, we unperceiv'd may go. Oroon. Look down, O mighty Love; behold thy flame Swallow'd, and burri'd, in the Conquerours Name: In vain thou shoot'st, and aim'st at faithful hearts, When he sustains, and shivers all thy Darts: While his Ambition does new worlds run o're, He'le bind thy fury, and revenge thy power.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus ScÃ¦na Prima. Alexander, Ephestion Lysimachus, Cassander, Philip, Bagistanes, and Captains in great State. Alex. Thus far with Thirst of fame we have descry'd. The modest World that wou'd her secrets hide, And track'd her where she to the Ocean ran. Diving her head under the spacious Main, Till a remoter World she rise again. Thither in hollow Trees with Wings we flew, And left old Countries to discover New; Nations by Nature taught, and distant so, Beyond the reach of any mortal Fo; Dwelling in Tents, unus'd to civil power, And having nought t'inrich a Conqueror, Fly where their stock of Land can ne're be spent, Finding no End of their vast Continent, Leaving behind them for the Victors gains, Famine, and Plagues, Rewards for fruitless pains. Lys. The Gods, Great Alexander, thought it fit The vanquish'd World shou'd to your Arms submit, When in a dream they did Olympia shew, She to a God did her conception owe. This Fame told loudly to the amazed Earth, What they should look from such a wondrous birth. Cas. First haughty Greece, which Philip ne're cou'd Yoke, Her Proudest Cities Necks bends to your Stroke: Then all that side Euphrates joyn with them To gain for you the Persian Diadem; This with three Battels from Darius won, Was but one step to Mount your mighty Throne. Then with such speed on Conquests Wings we got, Rise with the Sun, and met it where it sate; Nothing to hinder us, but by the way We took bold Tyre, that's built upon the Sea; And Mountains big with Woods we tumbled down, That frighted Neptune from his Royal Town. Phil. We sought fierce Nations, nourish'd up with damps, Whom Rocks of Ice immur'd in frozen Camps; With shouts we made the trembling Earth to sweat, Loosing the Shackles from it's tender Feet, Which soon Rebell'd, and us did onward lead To catch those Fish that on the Land did breed. Lys. From thence we pass'd to th'Suns beloved Soyl, To utmost India, and those Nations foyl, Till we were stopp'd by Heav'n, and Natures tyes. Huge Furniture, and Arms of mighty size We scatter'd here and there to take all Eyes, And make the World to come beleive, and shew The Souls were great that did those Bodies owe. Cas. Great Son of Philip, do not then begin Vain and imaginary Worlds to win; All that there is, is subject to your sway; Bless then in Peace, Sir, this your early day. The Gods to you at thirty years have given, More then the greatest Heroes boast in Heaven. Eph. Forget not, Sir, the time you were so bold, When clad in Armour made of shining Gold, As on the Oxydracon's Wall you fought, Thence like a Star into the Town you shot; And aw'd the People with a Godlike Frown; Who thought from Heav'n, that Mars himself leap'd down. At awful distance stood the wondring Croud, Let fall their Arms, and call'd thee God aloud. Phil. Live then, great Sir, to dissipate our fears, And Chronicle your self a thousand years. No more in vain your precious minutes shed, Tempting the Fates to think y'ar Mortal bred Capt. Great Son of Joveâ Alex. Confusion seize thy tongueâ I'le hear no more of such a Syren's Song. To Clytus death I owe a deadly shame; Swell'd with a Sound, and poyson'd with a Name I hurt my self, and madly was to blame. What canst not thou Ephestion bear a part, And share of dangers where thou sharest a heart. Shall a few Creatures whom we found abroad In Beds of Snow, which with our breath we thaw'd? And feather'd Indians, who before they bled, Like flocks of Birds before our Eagles fled; Small Trophies there we got, or here can get; Shall this suffice to gain the Name of great; Stain to our Armies, we have no Conquest won, If we do lye at ease at Babylon, And shrink at Glory e're we put it on. Eph. I'll on, while your Example I behold With wonder, which shall like a fixed Star, Direct my wandring Youth, till I am Old, And guide my soul in peace, and Armes in War. Alex. Millions of pleasures on Euphrates lye, Swelling her Bankes with plagues of luxury; They more than all the dangers you withstood Will dant your Courages, and chill your blood. You see her guilded Tow'rs, and Turrets pride, But they come short of beauties that they hide. Eph. Beauty I've heard, the Gods did first ordain To cherish Valour and reward it's payn: This hea'ven-born Creature for your entrance stayes To deck with plumes of love your guilded Bayes. Cass. The Armyes all must on your Center more; This time is sacred both to you and love; When you lye downe 'tis fit that war shou'd cease, And treate you with an universal peace. Bag. Thus humbly I my mighty charge resigne, [Bag. kneells. Darius Empire, and his Royal Line. Retire, great Sir, and all your hopes possesse, Adorne your Conquests with loves happiness. The blest Statira does her self prepare, To weave you Chaplets of her Golden haire. Alex. Tell her I waite, and only for her stay To Crowne the Triumph of this happy day. [exit Bag: Now my Ephestion, guard thy tender Breast; I'll shew thee halfe wherewith my soul is blest. Eph. What need I shun whereof I am possest? In Athens late you nip'd my forward growth. And from my tender studies broke my Youth; Then call'd me to you from my Country far To waite upon you, and to teach me War. In Battailes toiles, when you the day had spent, You'd take me to you private in your Tent; There, as to shelter in some silent grove, You'd shut me in, and tell me tales of Love. Your charming tongue did ope my breast so wide, Love shot in shafts, on which himself did ride: When on Statira's Picture you wou'd look, Faire Parisatis forme from you I tooke. Alex. What I then told thee did but breed desire, Which her bright Eyes will kindle into fire: Thou but indur'dst the skirmish of a Fight. I touch'd thy Breast, but she will kill thee quite: Eph. Wou'd she wou'd come: I long to be thus slayn; For ought that I know, 'tis a pleasant pain: Yet if to be in love, so mortal be, What makes so many happy, that we see? Alex. Such are, whom love a kind acceptance showes, Your Fate by chance may make you one of thoseâ Behold how these faire Goddesses appear! Eph. O Gods! But which is she that I must feare? Enter to them Statira, Parisatis, Women, Bagistanes and attendants at one door, and Oroondates, and Araxis, at another door, at some distance. Oroo. Here we will stand, and dare the worst of fate, [to Ar. aside. She cannot find us in this throng of state, Alex. So Venus look'd, so Venus smote from far The Iron bosome of the God of War; So look's the Sun, so the spring sweetly smiles, When the cold deadly Winter it beguiles; Thus welcome is the day into his sight, Who many years was banish'd from the light. Let me presume to touch this sacred hand, As Marriners, when they the Port have gain'd, Do bless the shore, and kisse the welcome Land. My Crimes of War have made me guilty come To choose from you a soft, and gentle doome. Sta. Hold Alexander, tempt me not in Vain;â Behold the blood that does your Ensignes stain. Is not this Persia? did not all this State, Before 'twas yours, on great Darius waite? Is not the sweet and cleer Araxis Flood Choak'd with dead Bodyes, poyson'd with their blood? Crown'd with this purple horrour on thy head, Do I not blush to see thee looke so red? Alex. When first your Country felt my angry Armes, They straight were pleas'd at faire Statira's charmes, And soon were sorry for the blood they spilt, And sought abroad to wash away the Guilt. That for one Kingdom from Darius torne, I'll sacrifice an hundred to your scorne. Sta. Those ner'e can come from petty Macedon; Thou bring'st and giv'st me, what is not thy owne; And all your borrow'd glory but appeares Deck'd with the Flaggs pull'd from my Fathers herse. Alex. What have I done, ye Gods? To see you frowne, Is more to me, than you to loose a Crowne. Sta. No fatal Monarch, still your Crimes persue, You are their darling, can't commit a fact, They have Darius punish'd, and not you, And scourge the world for all the wrongs you act. Eph. Ah gentle Goddesse, be not angry now; Disperse the storm that hangs upon your brow, Which or'e your beauty such disturbance seems, As windes create on smooth and Christal streams. Vouchsafe that I your sister may adore, And give a heart that was design'd before; But let me beg you wou'd not be severe, And in her frownes, as you in Beauties share. Alex. Still I presume unhappy, to be kind, That Parisatis for my Friend design'dâ Let it be said the least of all my faults, To give Ephestion to your kindest thoughtsâ [presents Eph. to Par. More then a Crown he on his head shall bring, He is my Favourite, more than twice a King. Par. I must beleive the Man y'are pleas'd to grace, May well deserve within my breast a place. Lys. O Gods! What discord was there in that Voice! She seemes to me as if she lik'd the choice. [aside, Sta. You are Ambitious to dispose of Fate, And King for Love, and Love for Kings create; So as y'ave slic'd, and given the world in parts, You'd take upon you to dispose of hearts; That you new Empires to the old might gain, You'd rule ore love, as you o're kingdomes raign. Alex. 'Tis an Ambition that from you I take, To become great, and only for your sake. I'le dedicate to Love my lasting Toyls, And crowd his guilded Temples with rich spoiles; His Altars shall with blood of Kings run o're, And their lost Crowns, and Scepters fill his Store. Sta. You give so much, your self seemes but the less; You hide your Merits in this gawdy dress: Love ne're will stoop to anything, but Love; The world may flatter me, but 'twill not move; Love is too rich a jewel to be bought, 'Twill only be in 'its own likeness sought. Alex. Those Ornaments to Love are iustly due, Who gave them as rewards for loving you; As he that wins the Prize at publique Playes Offers his God the Garland of his Bayes. Sta. You seek your Love in great and horrid formes, As Sun shine dayes are met by dreadful stormes; Your rav'nous Eagles in the Feild increase, Like Birds of prey, to rob this Dove of peace; Alex. I'l scatter this Contagion, whilst it flies, Like Clouds of Insects driven before your Eyes: I will my self of power, and Armes divest, And Love shall then in peace, and glory rest. All that Darius held, I will restore, And leave my self, without your favour poor; I'll give you all that's in my power to give, Yet after all, let Alexander live. Sta. Ah Monarch! Thou canst never end this strife, Till thou restor'st me to a Fathers life; His Kingdomes I shall never wish to have, And build my throne upon a Fathers Grave: Had not those Trophies on his Death began, I'de think the world has not a braver Man. Oroo. O Gods Araxis, did you hear! Alex. That you may see, how much his Death I grieve, I'll Crown his head, as if he were alive, And in the richest seat of Babylon, The world shall to his Golden Statue run, And pay more homage, then they do the Sun Sta. Desist that kindness; for 'tis only meant To make thy pride his fatal Monument, And let the world perceive by such a shew, That a great God did to thy Fortune bow. Why does thy Breast with such Ambition burn? Cannot his life, and Empire serve thy turn? Letting him rest within his silent Urne. Alex. All powers on Earth are subject still to Fate; Empires, as well as Men have sudden date. The Gods look'd down that held the Fate of Kings, And bad me one, and Arm'd me with their stings, 'Twas they, not I, your Fathers death decreed, And they ordain'd I shou'd in all succeed. Sta. The Gods have us'd thee but for punishment, And soon will end those plagues themselves have sent. The Gods thou mak'st the Authors of thy pride, Who n'er consented, that thou shoud'st divide, And snatch the husband from his woeful Bride, Then tare the Orphans from their parents Eyes. Which ne're can grace, but blush at Victories. To us thou shewst the Earth, yet holdest the Rains, Darius Daughters are not pleas'd in gawdy Chaines No Alexander, yet too low thou art, Mounted on all the world, to reach my heart. Oroo. Great God of Love thou hast thy pity show, [aside Exeunt Statira, Parisatis, and women, and Oroondates following at distance. Manent Alexander and the rest. Araxis, waite you hereâ Eph. Will you be gone?â Alex. Persia had stood, had its tame Heroes been But blest with so much spirite as this Queen.â Well, now, Ephestion, have you found it true, Women are worse than Armies to subdue? The skye is not so faire, nor downe so soft, But their hard hearts, are on the Anvile wrought. Eph. But Parisatis sure, is all divine, And cannot Sir, to cruelty incline: Yet I am sad, but 'tis not that I feare Her tender soul, but that she loves elswhere. Alex. You must not think she will at first obleige; Women, like Townes, hold out a longer siege. Enter one of the Captaines. Capt. The world does to great Alexander send All Nations proud to be your slaves contend: Ambassadours from all parts, present bring, Begging you'd be, or else create their King. Amongst the rest proud Scythia stoopes in time, The greatest Empire in the Northern Clime: For since the Battaile from Darius won, That gallant Oroondates has been gone, They Offer you his rich, and mighty Throne. Ara. Ah fatall! Newesâ [aside. Alex. That Prince if he be slainâ There's not a Braver Heroe does remain, And I with sorrow must his Empire gain. Exeunt. Manet Araxis Solus. Ara. Go Oroondates now, and finde thy death; Thou hast no place, no Earth, no Aire to breath, But what is Alexanders; nay whats more, He holds thy Love, and Fortune in his power. Where shall we wander now? where be possest That we may live from care, and love at rest. Reenter to them Oroondates. He is return'd, for pity I'll refrain To tell the news that will increase his pain. Oroo. Araxis come, le'ts undermine our Foes, And follow Alexander where he goes; Let's watch his lookes, and Countermine his sight, Till on Statira's Cheeks our Eyes do fight, [Oroo. offers to go off. Ara. Stay Oroondates, are you in a dream? Beware the Gulph, y'are led to by the stream. Unless invisible, you cannot passe! For Jealousy through all things sees, like Glasse. Let's straight return; tis dangerous staying here, Your Carriage did suspitiously appear; For Alexander saw when you went out, And after you he turn'd his Jealousie Eyes about. Oroo. I have no soul, no Eyes, no thing that's sence; They all have left me with that excellence. I find my self like one of life bereft, And nothing but a solid Carkasse left. I'l find her through the dark, and let her know't, T'releive my Body, as a light that's out. Ara. Now it is almost neer retreat of day, Whose hand-maid evening lookes so fresh and gay, T'will make Statira to the walks repair, And with her sweeter Breath perfume the Air. Thither we'll go, by th'secret way we came; There you may find, but here you'l lose your aim. Oroo. I'll find my Rivall wrap'd in his delight, Who as the Globe, oft hides the Suns faire light Stands betwixt me and my Statira's sight. I'l grow above him till I have descry'd, O're his huge Bulke the treasure he wou'd hide. Why shou'd I fear this Monster of a Name? Wherefore Araxis? Am not I the same, Who striding o're the heapes his slaughter fill'd, Sustein'd his mighty Arme upon my sheild? Then straight return'd a more substantial blow, That made his head with shameful weakness bow, And blush'd for greif, till he did understand, It was no shame, from Oroondates hand. Ara. The State retreats from the Kings private Room:â One of the Princesses does this way comeâ Retire into the Garden Sir, before w'are seen. Oroo. Not stay!âI'll speak t'her, if it be my Queen. Enter to them Statira, Melanthe attended So leaves of flowers, shut up in showers of Rain, Open their bosomes with the Sun again. Sta. Blesse me ye Gods! 'Tis Oroondates sure! What passions does my trembling heart indure! Why Oroondates, will you not obey? See, see, Melanthe, who does come this way. Are you that haughty stranger then, who late, Among the throng did on the Conquerour wait? How durst you be so bold? Urg'd by what thought? Was't Jealousie, or Love your Person brought? Oroon. Ah glorious Creature; Blest of all thy Sex, Urge not imputed Crimes my Soul to vexâ [Kneels. I'le tell thee, Dear, more soft, more sweet by far, Than breath of Incense, or than morning Air, Wing'd with my Love, and hurri'd by despair, I broak through all the stops, that Fate cou'd rear; Who can Love you, and be a slave to fear! Sta. Rise Oroondates. Alexander sees; The Gods do frown, and he on Earth decrees; Like flaming horrour o're the World 'e Darts, And pries into the secret Lovers hearts; That blazing Comet in the Skye beware, Who threatens me with Love, and you with War. Oroon. He cannot gentle Creature, do us harm; True Love's a Pow'r that all the Gods will charm, And winged Furies of the Air disarm. While our united hearts with joyes are Crown'd. No Fiend shall tread the sacred Lovers Ground. Let him look down, this Meteor that's so high, To see our Loves with all it's lustre vie, And drop with wonder from it's borrow'd Skye. Sta. The Gods to us are yet the more unkind. Where shall we then those pleasant minutes find, And seek out Love, while we do lye confin'd? Unless in pitty he to us resort, And meet us here in Alexanders Court. The Watchful Dragon here disturbs our peace, More strict, than that which kept the Golden Fleece. Oroon. Since else y'are lost to Oroondates quite, I'le break your Chains, and with the Monster fight: I only arm'd with Love, if you but say Through all his Dev'lish Guards will force my way; Defie this Atlas, if he durst be bold, And lay at stake the Heav'n that he does holdâ Say but the word, and I'le at once remove The Scourge of Empires, and the plague of Love. Sta. No Oroondates, cease this vain design, He 's at his highest, and will soon decline. The Gods in time, in pity of our tears, Will rid the World and us of all it's fears. Oroon. Never let's tarry, for in all that time. Our Love might reach, and up to Heav'n might climb; Let us not waste one moment of our Joyes, More worth than Crowns, and all such Worldly toyes, Nor wait so long for Alexanders death, But straight get out of this unlucky Path, And turn our Eyes as from some Desert climb, And never wish to look the second time. Hence we'le repair to some blest lonely Isle, On whose fair Breast, both Heav'n and Nature smile, Far from the gaudy Train of dismal Sate; And we our selves will King and Queen create, And each to other shall a Subject be, Living on Earth, like Spheres in Harmony. Sta. There at our Joyes will none with envy burn, Nor Alexander were he there, return; He soon the weary hunted World would spare, And find enough to glut Ambition there.â But Oh thou excellent man! I talk, while you Neglect your safety, and my honour too; I feel it strive within me: for by turns, My honour blushes, and your danger mournsâ Dear Oroondates, spare your farther talk; See me to morrow i'the Cyprus walk. Oroon. Go my propitious Goddess, thou that art The Heavenly excellence of all my heart;â Take but one look, thou best of Deities, And carry't from me in thy Diamond Eyes, That when the Conqu'rour comes to beg a Grace, Bend thy dark brow, and shoot it in his Face. Sta. Thou best of Men, all Joyes about thee dwell. Oroon. Thou Soul of Love, and all that's good, Farewell. [Exeunt severally. Finis Actus Secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius ScÃ¦na Prima. Parisatis, Melanthe, as in the Garden. Ephestion enters at a distance. Eph. See where she Rests, or is't not I descry Some dazling Constellation from the Skye! Sure 'tis the rich Vermillion that does grace The evening Sun sent t'adorn this place, Or Venus self has left her Heavenly abode; To Sleep on Earth with some immortal Godâ Heark, how the Air with Gentle murmur Steals, To catch the Odour on her Lips, that dwells, More sweet than Breath, sent from the Couslips Bed, Or fragrant Banks with purple Violets spread. A Song to be Sung by Oroondates unseen in the Garden. In vain dear Cassandra in vain you imploy, Your precepts of Virtue my Love to destroy, In thinking your breath, can allay my desire, You cool but my hopes, and blow more the fire, Though hopeless of favour, and slighted I were, I could Love, while I live, condemn'd to despair. But why do I wish for impossible things, Such happiness fit for the greatest of Kings, For to me are deni'd all blessings within, But to pass by her door and afraid to go in, Or if her by chance at a distance, I see? My Soul at my Mouth flying instant from me. But when I come near her, I look and I gaze, And somewhat would say, but am still in amaze. When as with my courage, new breath I infuse, Just ready to say, what I fear I should lose, The thing that I thought on a sudden retires, And my speech in a sigh on her bosome expires. [Enter Lysimachus at the other door. Lys. A voice! To whom should this address belong! O Gods! There's Parisatis list'ning to the Song! Ephestion too! O my prophetique Soul! What shall I do to keep my senses whole! Eph. 'Tis doneâthis was I fear some Rivals voice.â Lysimachus the man! Is he her choice! Mel. 'Tis Oroondates sure, amongst the Trees; Par. Cease wretched Lover, cease thy sad complaint; Whilest no kind friend thy banish'd person sees, With mournful tunes thou dost thy sorrows paint. Lys. See how 'e sets his amorous looks this while! I'le overtake, and stab him in that smile. I'le break that case, his tempting beauties fill, And all his precious balm of life will spill. I shall turn mad to let my rage grow higher;â I will be patient, and unseen retire. Par. I hear some coming; let's no longer stay. [Exit. Lysimachus, Parisatis and Mel. offer to go off. Eph. See, she retires, and he does lead the way. Look back, O beauteous daughter of the spring, Whose divine presence, whiles these walks she treads Makes chearful Birds with welcome Carrols sing, And drooping flowers hold up their grateful heads. Par. What beauti's this of which Ephestion tells? Can she augment the Joyes with which he swells, That holds a richer, and more blest repose, In Alexanders bosome where he grows. Eph. In Alexanders Lawrels I have laid My head so long; that I forsake his shade, To dwell in your more comfortable sight, Whose brighter beams create a fresh delight. Par. I have no beauty, Sir, that I can boast, Such as I had is all in sorrows lost, Like forward spring, kept back by winter frost. The Sun that guilded o're with cheerful rayes My early morn, and promis'd happy days, By fatal Alexander is undone, And quite eclip'st before it reach'd to noon. Eph. What Miracle is this! For who is he, That cannot grant, what you wou'd wish to be? Where was deaf Heav'n, when you did bend to prayers! How could the Gods, but choose to lend their ears! One balmy sigh, and pearly tear's worth more, Then all the incense, sacrifice of Gore, That they have had, ten thousand years before. Par. You overvalue me; all will not do; I still am wretched, and more lost than you. The Gods are just, although they never will Refrain, but punish Parisatis still. [Par. sighs. Eph. Ah! why d'ye sigh, and waste that precious breath, When the least word can charm the power of death. Why draw you up, and fill your breast with groans? Then let 'em out with all your soul at once: Where will this Messenger of grief depart? That bears upon his wings your gentle heartâ Ah do not stirâI tremble to come nigh, [Par. offers to be gone. And on your brightness gaze with such an eye As mortals look with wonder up on high. Par. I am no Deity, yet will not endure To be approach'd, but with a flame as pure. You say you love, yet for the time you live, Expect no more from me, than Heaven can give. Eph. Not to look thus; and sighâhow blest were I, Only to gaze upon you, till I dye; That with my Love my Soul might then expire, And both mount upwards, like gay sparks of Fire; Where I'le your seat amongst the Gods prepare, And pine, and taste no Heav'n, till you come there. Par. Still noble Youth, you cannot reach your bliss, With Love, as Heav'nly as your person is. There's nothing to deceive you, I wou'd hide; Another ha's surpris'd my dearest thought, I am his Pris'ner, and by honour ty'd; With richest gratitude my Love is bought; I have no room for such another guestâ Eph. The Gods forbid!âI dare not hear the restâ May not my hopes a fairer prospect view? Yet curst am I, and what you say is true. That fatal Oracle has sent me home, For ever damn'd, to undergo your doom. What shall I do? To whom shall I complain? To Alexander? That were too, in vain. You, and Statira, both contrive his end, She stabs him in his person, you in's Friend. Par. Admire no more in what you call my charms, Shun 'em young Prince, their all but painted harms. Be happi'r then, and give your Love elsewhere, None that can Love will be to you severe: I boast not of the Chains I make you were. Eph. Ah do not think my stedfast Love can shakes You can as well the Vowes you made forsake; Your banish'd Man all his life long shall wait, Let others seem to Love, and stop at hate, I Love not you at such an easie rate. If e're you call me home, there will be found, Fix'd on my breast, your sad immortal wound. Par. I dare not hearâyou wound my tender breast. [offers to go off. Eph. You shall be pitiful, and hear the restâ See I conjureâMy tears begin to flow, Thus fix'd, while I shed all my moisture so, Like Nyobe, I could a Statue grow. I guess my Rival, that your thoughts endureâ But let me doubt still, rather than be sure. Par. What tempted by the Object, you repeat, Your heart in time of absence may forgetâ I haste for pity, to remove the cause. [offers to be gone. Eph. Pity forbids, but this my ruin drawes. If once a day, you don't your presence give, I have consider'd, and I cannot live; Let me for ever then be doom'd to burn, Seeing your kindness to my Rival turn, And whiles the Ocean of your Love he bears, I thirst in vain, and quench it with my tears; Par. If it be so, then think no more of me; How can you choose but hate this cruel she? Eph. No, I'le retire into the shades below, Drest with a Willow Garland of despair; Where all are blest, I'le live in solemn wo, And with kind wishes Crown each happy pair. Oft as a spirit I'le return on Earth, But take no horrid form that shall affright, But soft as evening Air or mornings Birth, In beauteous Dreams I'le study your delight: Then in the morning, watching while you wake, Before your Eyes like gleams of light I'le run; With breath of Amber I perfumes will make, And dart in Glories with the rising Sun. Par. If you say more I must in pity drown. [Exit Parisatis attended. Eph. So the quick Sun; soon as his light is shewn, Leaving the World in darkness does go down. Go my divided Soulâ Enter Lysimachus, and calls back Ephestion, who was going out at the other door. Lys. Ephestion stayâ You have commands from Alexander to obey. Eph. Why do you hinder me, and bid me stand? I know it was not by my Kings Commandâ I fear Lysimachus, you envious are. Lys. 'Tis kindness bids Ephestion to beware; And as a Friend, I wish you to retreat, And see your danger e're it be too late;â You tread a maze of a beauty to your fate. This passage leads to death's eternal bands! Preventless run at your entrance stands. Eph. What fate is this, you threaten with your breath, Nothing so fair as she can lead to death, There is no fear, no horror where she comes; Like Heav'nly light, she scatters Hell bred fumes: Still where she goes, all deadly Forms she ties, And melting dangers drop before her eyes. Lys. You are too young, I see, and cannot find The vast intreigue, of fatal women kind. Deceitful beauty, drest in golden smiles Like flatt'ring lightning, quick, and silent burns, As poyson pleasant to the taste beguiles; So soon as drank, to deadly ruin turns. Eph. You speak indeed; as if you felt it so, But she ha's been to me the softest Foe. Her soul appears all glorious as her face, A shining Jewel in a Chrystal case. Lys. 'Tis a false Light, that shewes like Heav'nly Fire. Leading misguided youth, so far astray, That straight in horrid darkness 't does retire; And leaves him then where dangers fill the way. A false disease, no cunning Herb can cure; A treacherous plague, worse then a Callenture, That to the Sea-men seems delightful meads, Or tempting walks, bestrow'd with curious Flowers, Then head long him into the Ocean leads, Where the next wave his giddy life devours. Eph. You shall not rail on Beauty I adore; 'Tis an offence, and I will hear no more. Lys. You shall in ignorance no longer rove; Know then 'tis Parisatis that I Love. Eph. I see your kindness now; she is the shelf, You bid me shun, on which you'd spilt your self: Now I perceive, when Alexander chose You out before the rest, to go for Thrace, Why you rejoyc'd, and triumph'd at the cause; Only to be first happy in my place. 'Twas Parisatis then that made you fly With wings of Love, and not of loyalty. Lys. 'Twas in defence of Love: can he be blam'd, That sues for aid, when there is War proclaim'd; When you and Alexander lots did cast For all my hopes, 'twas time for me to haste. Eph. Y'are come too late, and you resist in vain, What Heav'n, and Alexander both ordain. Lys. I first this Jewel in my heart did wear; You ne're had seen't, but spi'd it shining there; Then when you knew, that I did Love before, You have unjustly robb'd me of my store: I hid her like a Treasure in the ground, Which you unkindly have dug up, and found; Like one who all his life had toil'd for wealth, Spoil'd in a moment; and undone by stealth. Eph. Because you were born first, and first had sight, Must I in darkness live, and ne're see light, Must he that miss'd, and saw the Sun not rise, Never hereafter see it in the Skyes? You may come short, unless you mend your pace; Who last sets out, may soonest win the race, Lys. Take heed; ill fate persues thee in the Chase: I, in the midst of thy Carreer, will stay, And stand like a Colossus in thy way. Though you with charms of youth, and beauty see This glorious Sun shall be too quick for thee. Or if it been't; I like a storm will rise, And in Eclipse convey it from thy Eyes. Eph. What then, you think, that I can be afraid?â I fear you not, though you my youth upbraid; Though you with ods of years, and strength assail, Young as I am, I can, and will prevail; Full of the Deity, I am above Thy reach, and walk inchanted by my Love; Safe in his Magick Circle round my heart; Who bears Loves wounds, can fear no other smart. Lys. No more, when next thou seest her, thou shalt dy, Although that minute, you for refuge flye To Alexanders arms for Sanctuary. Eph. Thinkest thou, whom Alexander loves, to fright? No, then, to let you see, that I dare fight?â I Love her dearly; by the Gods I do; I Love herâYes, and will, in spight of you. Now I'le go to her, and if I must dye, It shall be there, in death of extasie; Upon her breast, as in a trance I'le roll, Drowning in sweets, that fill the precious bowl. And on her Lips, leave my departing Soul. [offers to go out. Lys. Come back againâWhat shall I do?âI willâ But thou presumest on Alexander still. I'le to my self this satisfaction give. Though after thee, I know I must not live. As they begin to fight, enter Oroondates, and Araxis, at distance, which makes Lysimachus and Ephestion go out, and defer fighting. Lys. Draw Sirâ Eph. Behold, we cannot end our strife.â Lys. Curst chance! This but prolongs thy sickly life. [Exeunt Lys. and Eph. Manent Oroon. and Araxis. Oroon. Ha! Lets retire; we cannot be alone, Arax. One is LysimachusâSee, they are gone. Oroon. Of all the Grecian Captains, I've been told, That he excells in Virtue, and is bold. Whoes the other?â Arax. I know not what he's call'd; Both gracious with the King; but I admire They seem'd surpris'd, and did from us retire. Oroon. This is the place, and this the blessed hour.â Leave me a while upon the long'd for shore;â Leave me.â Arax. See Sir, as when a storm is o'reâ Now y'are arriv'd, it scatters, and it clears, And she like Venus on the sand appears. [Exit. Araxis Enter to them Statira, Parisatis, Melanthe, and attendants. Oroon. Now is the light just fallen from the Skyes. And blushes like the morn adorn those eyes. Sta. Ah Oroondates, grasp me not not so hard, Oroon. Deny me not this innocent reward, [kisses her Hand. As the kind Sun does to a frozen boat, Unbridle the poor Bark into a float Then gently bathing o're it's melting sides, It lists it self above the swelling tides! All those thick Joyes that lay conjeal'd below, Swell o're the brink, and their large bounds o're flow. Sta. Ah Oroondates, I have newes to tell Will sink your Soul, and chain the Powers of Hell. Oroon. Think not Statira, that my breast can own A passion for the losing of my Throne, Thou brighter Jewel than the Scythian Crown. Be thou but constant, as thou now art kind, I shall a lasting Throne of greatness find, More Riches, then in all the World there shines, In Diamond quarries, or in Golden mines: There is no wealth, but what abounds in thee, Thou sweetest Soul, thou true Felicity. Arax. I haste, and yet I fear I come too slow; Like a huge Torrent that does overflow; The King is here, and ha's surpris'd you now. Sta. What shall we do?â Oroon. Heedless Araxis thouâ Par. Go you, leave Oroondates here with me. Oroon. There is no shape that virtue fears to see:â Here I will stand in thy defence O Love, Like Jove, himself, and dare this Son of Jove. Sta. Go, go, you put my soul upon the wrack!â Fly this unhappy groundâ Enter to them Alexander, Cassander, Phillip, Bagistanes, and Attendants. Guards. Alex. Stay Sir; come back.â What art, that darest such saucy Courtship shew? And bend to th'shrine, where I presume to bow. Sta. Retire Sir from the King; I'le undertake.â Alex. By all the Gods, he stirs not for your sake. Oroon. Do not for me to the least doubt resign; Nought, but your fears can shake a heart like mine. Alex. Tell me great Jove, who cou'd suspect to see So false a soul, in such a shape as she? Where sacred Virtue wilt thou shew thy face, When such as she lookes with deceitful grace, Methoughts I saw her high Illustrious mind Sate only with severity inshrin'd, And thought her like a stream, whose modest tyde Does in Meanders from the Mountains glide; Yet every where the bottom is so cleer, Through all its Christal golden sands appearâ Convey away this upstart of my heart.â Yet I will know thee firstâSay, what thou art? Oroo. I turn to tell thee, that it was not fear; When you have known me, you'l confess I dare. I ne're was question'd, and deny'd my name,â Do you not know me then, nor who I am? Sta. Y'are mad, and wou'd your self in vain disclose: For Alexander none, but Princes knowes. Alex. You urge the more; I'le know him e're 'e goes Oroo. Behold; have you not seen this face in War? Alex. I think I might, then tell me who you are. Sta. I'le tell you who he is, let him be gone; His person cannot merit to be known. Oroo. Tis Oroondates that you see again. Alex. What Oroondates, that we heard was slain! Oroo. Yes Alexander, that unhappy Man, Whose Crown, and Empire to your fortunes ran, With base submission, which your Armes nere won, nor can. Alex. If you so much your single valour prize, How came you hither, in a tame disguise? And shun my presence, like the Bird of Night, Which us'd to darkness dare's not see the light. Dealing unlike a Prince, in dark designes, And like a Coward, workes and undermines. Oroo. Thus I wou'd shew, didst thou not hide my face. Stand from before me in this blessed place. Then bate the ods thy Mistress fortune gain'd And this fair Queen in judgment of us stand, Though like a flaming Beacon thou doest fright Tame Nations, Id'e look up, and shine as bright. Alex. Then you can boast of what she me deny'd And shew'd her scorne, I took for noble pride. Sta. If thou art gallant, Alexander, know, That I so much to Oroondates owe, Your self wou'd think I cannot less bestow. If more than Freind, Darius life he save, The hazard of his Crown, and fortune gave, And this is all the pity I have shewn; A mean reward for losing of a Crown, Tygers, and Monsters wou'd forsake their kind, And melt, where so much gratitude they find. Alex. Women when pleas'd their eager loves to show, Swift with the stream of inclination go, But if against that Tyde, they move but slow. Y'are over just, where fancy shewes the way, But leave your debts of honour still to pay. Who can resist the Torrent of your wills, That run more fierce, and cross than Fortunes wheels? Wretched is he whose love maintaines your pride, More then the slave that to the Galli's ty'd, Who sweates, and labours, all for stripes and scorne. Sta. Your mind is toss'd; o're Seas of passion borne. Know that my soul, scorning the Pompe of life, Made me refuse to be the greatest wife, And mount that Throne, my Fathers ruine built, Making me guilty of the blood you spilt. My vertue aim'd and shot the mark more high, Holding me here when I might safely flye; And rather chose your Chaines, then let my soul By flight be stain'd with a reproach so foul. Oroo. Your cruel vertue, so severe inclin'd, Hath been to me and to your self unkind. Alex. Flatter thy self, but thou shalt never find One Jealous coward thought defame my mind, My fortune like the Ocean that indures Contrary windes, and all less streams devours, Can ne're be Jealous, or afraid of yours. Oroo. That fortune ne're had gain'd the Scythian State, Had Oroondates but suspected fate; Kings by false subjects are at first ador'd, As fickle Nations court the rising Sun, Blest with the sweet delight it does afford, Till it has gain'd i'ts highest State at noon, Then they forsake; and from its warmth they run. Alex. I did from conquest of your Crown retreat, Too little, to make Alexander great; Scar'd with the height, to which my name did swell, And stunn'd with noise of all my Arms, it fell. I court no fawning Kingdomes to obtain; The world it self does to my Fortune chain, That sayes I shall a stand of greatness be, Where Nations flow, as Channels to the Sea. Nobler Ambition does my fancy move; I like the gallant Eagle soar above, And stoop to nothing, but the lure of love. You do my Rival then your self create. Oroo. Witness ye Gods, I glory more in that, Than all the world can give, or th'smiles of fate. I will not change the bliss that name can bring, To be as great as thou, to be in heaven a King. Nor quit the hopes my lingering love shall gain, That like a Saint indures with zealous pain, Till heav'n he gets through stormes of sighs and tears like rain. Alex. That heav'n which you with such fair hopes persue, You may behold, but ne're to be injoy'd by you: Yet, though my Rival, I will ease your grief, And to the worst of pains will give releif;â I'le part your sight, which else must needs destroy, Seeing that heav'n; which you can ne're enjoy.â Go where thou wilt, but never see her more. Sta. Go Oroondates, whom, the Gods restore. Oroo. Go Oroondates!âGods can you consent, That I shou'd dye for you in Banishment! I do not fear thee, and I will not stir; No, wert thou more then death a Conquerour; I in the worlds behalf will stand alone, And pull back all the spoils that deck thy Throneâ Tear me to Atomes pull my Eyes out quite, Thou may'st as well part water and divide the light, As think my soul can live out of her sight. Alex. Thou shalt, and live to see me only blest, Crown'd with her Love, inthron'd within her Breast.â Our joyes shall so Majestickly appear, That thou shalt tremble, and not dare come near, But hide thy face, for envy, and for fear. Oroo. Not dare come near!âBeware that fatal time, When I shall surely snatch thee in thy prime: This Cloud thou fearest, shall then disolve in Rain, And pour upon thee like a Hurry-Cane.â I tell thee, King, that I durst reach thy heart, Big with the horrid world, as now thou art: Had'st thou the plague before, and Hell behind, I in the midst wou'd thy dread Carkasse find; Nay were it mortal, where thou send'st thy breath, My furious haste shou'd blunt thy threatning death. Alex. Livest thou to threaten whom the Gods defend?â Convey him straight to his eternal endâ Death shall reward the valour you pretend. Sta. Hold Alexander hold,âHe shall not go; I ne're did beg of you, nor will I now; Yet I dare boldly say, he shall not dy, Unless his life with loss of mine you buy. The life I brought in danger to be slain, I am oblig'd in honour to maintain. Alex. Gods. Did I ever yet resolve in vain! Where be thy Conquests now that fill'd the world, That by a woman here, thy resolution's hurld? It shall be said that Alexander once was lost, And in a labouring Sea of love was tost; I will submit to be thy slave, O Love, To please my self, as did my Father Joveâ Cassander,âI will but his doom inlargeâ Le Oroondates be your strictest Charge. Oroo. Gods. How I hate this life you wou'd retore, That nor my freedome's justly in your power; Thy honour cannot let me be betray'd, I was thy Prisoner once, and ransome paid. Alex. If thou wert so, 'twas when thou wert unknown; Th'art Oroondates now, and claim'st a Crown.â Convey him henceâIt is my last decree. Oroo. They dare not do't, no, not thy Guards, nor thee. Sta. Bear Oroondates, what the Gods ordain; If you resist, you'l merit my disdain. Both heav'n, and Love will for our safeties joyn:â Are Chains so grevious in the sight of mine? Alex. Sure such a spirit did from heav'n descend. So great and true, we know not where 'twill bend. Exeunt Statira in anger, and Alexander attended, follows her. Manent Oroondates, Cassander, Araxis, Guards. Cass. Methinks your looks such gallant rage do shew As sits upon an angry Lyons brow: Your lofty mind above the world is born, And payes its Idle rage with noble scorn. Retire,âand till I call, approach not neerâ [to the Guard Let me be heard, Sir, with your private ear. [to Oroondates Oroo. His presence Sir with mine you may indure: [meaning Araxis For all my secrets, in his Breast are sure. Cass. Fortune has set a man upon her wheel, That never sees, how it goes downward still. More then Prometheus plagues from Hell 'e brings, And heaps and layes them on the Necks of Kings. Look up thou more than Man and all divine, Bearing the honour of th'Arscacean Line Upon thy highest top, spred like a Lofty Pine: With all thy Scythian Glories dart upon, And shrink the world again to Macedon. Oroo. Wherefore this great Civillity to me?â Your words have meaning too I cannot see. Cass. Look up, and never do the Cause inquire, But quench this Flame that sets the world on Fire; To rid the Earth of Alexanders life, To ease Mankind of universal strife, Your Crown restore, and bless you with a wife. Oroo. Were I releas'd and from his Fetters freed, And had the possibility of such a deed; Though to be more then he by such an Act, I'd fly the horrour of so base a fact; I'd kill him, but I wou'd not by surprise; It shou'd be then when most secure 'e lies, When all his Guards are watching of his Eyes, Ith' Face of Jove and in the clearest day; When heav'n that faw't, shou'd nothing have to say. Cass. In rules of virtue you are too sublime, Why shou'd it be to kill him such a Crime? Wou'd you not crush that viper if you cou'd, That threatens with his sting your dearest blood; That fatal Man that stabbs your soul in her; I'th' discipline of virtue, I'd go far; But fair Statira's Love I wou'd prefer. Oroo. Convey me straight into the darkest hole; Let me live ever like a dungeon Mole, Rather than see the light with such a soul; But thou that showest me this ignoble way, Art sent by him that wou'd my life betray. Cass. No by the Gods, from him it was not meant: I've try'd, and found you hard to honour bent: I see your soul, and nothing else design'd, But my true breast a harbour for your mind, Where you might rest your heart serene, and free From tempests and your self in safety see, Your Godlike mind at such a prize I rate, That, though I pity, and deplore your Fate, I cannot but admire, and imitate. Accept the freedome that your soul does wear, And I the fault of your escape will bear. Oroo. Thou tryest my mind, and yet doest think I fear. Go on; let me the ruggedst usage feel; Thou hast one us'd to such misfortune still, That alwayes holds the Vessel that they fill With patient steddy hands, that never spillâ Sir when I can, your kindness I'le restore. [Exit Oroo. with Guards Cass. My words are thrown, like dust upon the shore. This Treason then my self will bear alone Under whose mighty weight the Fates do grone Sweating in clouds of horrour the evening Sun Shall see the greatest deed that e're was done. [Exit Cassander. Finis Actus Tertii.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Cassander, and Phillip severally. Cass. reading a Lettter, Phil. What news Cassander, have you heard from home? Cass. News, Phillip, that concern the mightyest doom; A sovereigne Balme for the sick world is come. A certain trick for Phillips mad brain'd Son, T'unravel all that Fate for him has done; Such News, that heav'n by me alone commends, And to the world it's pretious freedome sends. The Gods have sate, and giv'n the Fates to know, They'l change their great Vice-gerent here below. My aged Father pours in every vein Fresh blood, and ha's begotten me again. Phil. The King I left inrag'd, and in a Flame At Letters too that from my Father came. Cass. Let him be so, as long as 'tis his last; It is decre'd he cannot burn too fast, See here the greatest, and most powerful spell, Pull'd from the very heart, and root of Hell, Hatch'd in designe from Aristotles skull To whom the subtil'st Feind of Hell is dull; Thou ne're coud'st find the flowing of the sea, But this shall be of greater fame to thee. Never let that disturb thy curious mind, That canst an Ebb for the worlds Torrent find. Phil. Antipater our Father does impart [Phillip takes and reads the Letter. A secret found by Aristotles Art; A Juice so fierce, and subtile, that no Case, Nothing can hold it, whence that will not pass, But the cold hoofe of a scorn'd heavy Ass. This deadly poyson now from Greece is brought, To give to Alexander in a draught. Cass. Neer high Olympus 'e Crown'd with lofty Wood, Under its shade, where nightly vapours brood; That ne're sees Sun by day, nor Moon by night, But with it's bending Front still pushes at the light; In whose damp Beds, where grow immortal stings, Clouds of dark spirits descend, and dip their wings, Then o're the world with molting Feathers fly, And Scatter plagues, that breed Mortality. From thence this mighty Tutor took a weed, And did thereof this deadly drink compound, That to his heart who drinks, it flyes with speed, And in his death no sign of poyson's found! Phil. Can the Fates suffer that so base a thing Conspire the death of the worlds mighty King! In this thou art in thy misfortune blest; All things deny to bear it to thy Breast, But the most Coward, and ignoble Beast. But when; when shall be done this mighty deed? Cass. No longer then this day it is decreed. Phil. You bear the Cup, and you may do't with ease. Cass. By heav'n the thought does my rouz'd senses please, This night I'le do't, in his proud sacrifice, And send him to his Kindered Deities. Oh how I burn, and how my Cheeks still glow! Since like a patient Boy I took that blow. Phil. I wish we were of Oroondates sure. Cass. Virtu's his guard, and holds him too secure, Only we two must all the brunt indure. Lysimachus I fear will not be won, And others too, who will be glad when't's done, And stand amongst the foremost for their share; But for our own proportion, first let's care; You have your Armys won, and soon shall gain Syria and over all the East shall raign, And I by right, Antipaters first Son Shall him succeed, o're Greece, and Macedon. Enter to them Bagistanes. Bag. The King in hast does for your prisoner call, Such labouring Tempests toss his mighty soul, That we, as when from heav'n we Thunder hear, Crouch, and a blasting storme of lightning fear. H'as for the Ambassadours of Scythia sent; The Gods yet only know what's his intent. Cass. I'le instantly his gallant Rival bringâ Phillip make haste, and in my absence place The Macedonian Guards about the King. Exeunt Cassander and Phillip severally, Manet Bagistanes. Enter to him Statira attended. Sta. What change now weares the worlds inconstant Face? What can its Masters mighty mind displace? Why glories he i'th' fetters of the brave That to the vanquish'd world is more a slave? Ah Bagistanes, all my hopes still blast; All my delights before enjoyment wast, My envious star deny me but a tast. The King does now for Oroondates send, His rage in pompe does mighty pow'r attend; He means to sit in Triumph on his end. Bag. You only now can Guard his innocence; The Gods you serve have arm'd you with defence: Beauty like yours can never want the power To break the heart of this great Conquerour. Go, interpose e're Oroondates dyes; Revert the blow with' Glories of your Eyes: Whole Armies have been often broke in fight, And wounded by the Sun with too much light; This cloud but while you come, may overcast, And can no longer o're your Beauty last. Enter to them Oroondates, Araxis, and Guards. See where the Noble generous Prince appears; How like a lofty ship up in a storm 'e bears. I go to see how the Kings passion cleeres. [Exit Bagistanes. Oroo. What heav'n is this I meet with in the way? Nothing can prove unfortunate to day. Thou light, thou better Genius of my soul; Goddess of life, that does my Fate controul; The kindest Gods have sent thee from above, With their divinest pow'r to rescue Love. Sta. You Oroondates are your owne reward; 'Tis your own virtue does it's person guard; If all I have can your protection bear, You need not doubt to find your safety here. Oroo. Brightness, and heav'n are dwelling in that Breast; None but a God shou'd with that seat be blest, Thou soft Elisium of eternal rest. When first my heart was on Loves Altar layd, So pure, and sacred, heav'n the offering made, And in acceptance of i'ts chast desire, Burn't and consum'd it all with heav'nly fire; The flame has purifi'd my breast so fine, You may behold my weeping soul within. Sta. My soul in vain lookes through it's mortal Cage, And spying yours, does mourne to disingage, Wishing to fly from Alexander's rage. Where shall they meet these spirits so alli'd? As two pent Birds that one another spi'd, We faine wou'd flye, forgetting that we're ty'd. What heavy Cloggs the envious bodies prove, To break the heart of our aspiring Love? Cou'd we now lay these Earthly Robes, but by, Like darting Stars, we'd shoot, and stick ith' sky, And with the highest brightest Planets showe, And dwell where Alexander ne're shall go, There we wou'd raigne, and let him raign below. Oroo. We'l chain this flesh, and our proud Bodys tye, Letting our souls out of their windowes fly. Our Loves like souls their prisons shall despise, And meet each other flowing from our Eyes; There they shall mingle, whiles our twisted fight, As Lymbecks draw, shall feed them with delight; Our humble Bodies in the rear shall stand, Like two drawn Armies, ready at command; That when our soules, their cheifs, in parly joyn, They shall not dare to murmur, or repine. Sta. Hold Oroondates cease this killing strife; Give me my soul again thou better life; Against thy self thou tyest these forward hands, That wou'd make Alexander stoop at their commands: Lost and undone, if I do longer stay, My ravish'd sences all will fly away; They through my Eyes will their swift passage break, And leave my tongue without the pow'r to speak, Re-enter to them Cassander. Cass. The mighty King of all the world possest, With all things, but the fair Statira blest, Calls for the Prince, and to this place drawes near; His Friends about him gloriously appear, Like the gay seasons that adorne the year. Sta. I'le frown, if he but dares to disobey, And blast him like a winters stormy day. [Exit Statira attended. Oroo. Thus as a Curtain drawn before the light, Sh'as Snatch'd my sight, and I in darkness stray. It is ordain'd that I must set this night. In deepest shadows then I'le lay me down, And never more shall see the blessed Sun: Statira then, thy faithful Lover dyes, Thy Beauties, and my Rivals sacrifice; Over my grave thou wilt more splendid rise. The Scene drawes, and at an Altar is discover'd Alexander, Ephestion, Statira, Parisatis, Lysimachus, Phillip, Bagistanes, Scythian Ambassadours, Forraign Ambassadours, and other attendants in great State, Preists, Statue of Jupiter Hamon. Alexander comes upon the Stage, reading Letters. Alex. Cassanderâ Cass. Sir I come at your Commandâ With joy approach, and all attention stand. Alex. Read these; for from Antipater they came, That dares protest Olympia is to blame. He much against her government complains, Sayes he is wrong'd, whilest she wou'd take the paines There is the like from Aristotle too, That writes what false Antipater has said, is true; But I'le let Aristotle know one tear From my dear Mothers Eyes can wash her clear, And drown a thousand thoughts that are severe. What ail the Preists! They tremble, and look pale, And all in fears forsake the sacred Rail.â Give me the Bowl, and the Gods drink prepare. Pre. The mighty Jove's offended at our prayer: We had done all, we thought, that Heav'n could prise, Yet to th'alknowing God there did arise Something displeasing in our sacrifice, We kill'd a lusty slave, and of his blood, The altar, and the sacred fire bestrow'd, With richest Gumes, and forraign spices made, That wou'd the ransome of a King have paid. Just in that moment which our thoughts inspire, A cloud with thunder did from Heav'n retire And quench'd, and scatter'd all the holy fire; A horrid darkness fill'd the Temple round, And of faint Groves was heard a dreadful sound. Alex. T'attone the Gods with all our power we'l strive, I have a Nobler sacrifice to give, And vow this hour the offering to make [Alex. looking towards Oroon. Oroo. Where is this sacrifice that you bespeak? Is all this Cerimony for my sake? Thinkest thou to fright me with this bloody deed, To be the sacrifice that here must bleed? Sta. The Gods protect the King from such a thought. Oroo. Is mine the life that thy false Preists have bought? With shew of piety to cover fate, And treat the Gods with bloody Scenes they hate. Swift vengeance have they for this Act in store. And after I am dead, they'l thunder more. Alex. I find that thou with groveling sense doest move, And canst not understand the Son of Jove: The Gods that Alexander made, did lend A soul too great for thee to comprehend.â Your self shall be the Judge of your own case; Were I in yours, and you in Alexanders place? Were Oroondates next the Gods above, And I a slave intrench'd upon his Love; What Mercy, or what Justice wou'd you shower On such a one you held within your power? Oroo. Were I the Monarch of the world thou art, I'de look beneath me with a Godlike heart, Not rob the humblest shepherds of their sleepes, Whom harmless Love in careless slumbers keeps; Wert thou my slave and wert condemn'd this hour, I wou'd thy Love, and wou'd thy throne restore, And give thee past thy power of wishing more; That thy vast spirit shou'd into wonder shrinkâ I'de do; what thou hast not a soul to think. Alex. Brave as thou art, thou canst not yet come nigh; Thou shalt not have a thought to wish so high, But I will reach it, and above it fly.â Madamâ I've sent for Oroondates with designe, That he may see how far above you shine, And with your sacred virtue rule his fate, and mine. Oroo. Having so bright an Object thou must do What to her Beauty, and thy fame is due. Alex. I will not have my love prescrib'd by you; Yet I'le be both to Love and honour true.â The sacred pow'r of faire Statira's charmes Has priviledg'd your person here from harmes: Recourse to Love has wash'd away your guilt, It shan't be said that I so roughly dealt, To see your Blood in her protection spiltâ Take that from me which none but I wou'd spare, Your life, Your freedom too, as unconfin'd as Aire.â Ambassadours of Sythia, you are free;â Give Oroondates what you gave to mee. With life and freedom I restore your Throne, And with that sacrifice the Gods attone. And for this victime on the Altar kill'd; If they 're not pleas'd with blood already spill'd, They shall with thousands offer'd in the field, Sta. You have deserv'd, great Sir, and give us cause To think the world most happy in your lawes; This Act beyond the Glass of time shall run, This gallant Act as clear as is the Sun, Which none but Alexander could have done, It doth my thanks and admiration raise;â So great, tis undervalu'd by my praise. Oroo. Though in this publique Act you have deserv'd, Virtu's not lost that has not been observ'd; The Sun whose light sometimes we cannot see, Yet rules the world by secret Sympathy:â I wou'd appear, but am eclips'd by you.â If thou art Noble still our hopes persue. Alex. What wouldst thou have? What is there yet to do? Sta. Nothing, for you beyond just hopes aspire, And to do more is past the Gods desire. [Preist gives Cassander the bowl, he offers it Alexander on his knees. Cass. The greatest God that you the world has giv'n, To rule on Earth, as he does rule in heav'n, That God who does all other Gods controll. Drinks to his Son in this Immortal Bowl. Let heav'n look down with most auspicious Eyes, Whiles Joves imperial Son does sacrifice. Alex. takes the Cup, and bowes to the Altar. Alex. Accept, great Joves, the Son whom thou hast crown'd, Who was the first thy secret Temple found, Seated beyond the world in holy Ground. Past barren Lybia, and it's dearest Lands, Through hot parch'd Grounds, and over burning sandsâ As the first fruites of all thou gav'st to mee, I sacrifice the world again to thee, And drink this Cup of Immortality. Whiles Alexander drinks, the Statue of Jupiter Hamon falls down, with thunder, and lightning and kills the Preists. Alex. lets fall the Bowl. Alex. Ye Gods what's wanting in such vowes as these, That can the soul of Jupiter displease? I'le send in haste for the most cunning Spyes To search the Oracle o'th' Deities; But I'le through fate this dreadful Riddle find. And know why Jove can be to me unkind. Cass. We are betrai'd by these base Prodigies, The Language of the tell-tale Deities; Philip stand firmeâ I'll bear the guilt of all, least thou shou'dst sink, And take the rest of the most fatal drinkâ I charge thee stay me notâ [exit, Phillip offers to hold him. Eph. Ah Sir, retire from this most horrid sight; I wish you had not sacrific'd to night: A dream last night disturb'd my quiet rest; Me thought I (leaning on your noble Breast) Was in a moment snatch'd, and dispossest: A flaming Charriot did from heav'n appear, And took you in, whilest I look'd up with fear, And saw you shine a Constellation there: The Charriot gone that fill'd the place so bright, I felt no Ground and sunk in Darkness quite. Alex. Let not such fears thy gentle thoughts divide; This dream foretels thou shalt i'th' Chariot ride, With lovely Parisatis by thy side. This way we will appease the angry Jove, And quench his rage with sacrifice of love;â [to Oroondates To morrow Rival if thou darest be bold, Mine and Ephestions marriage to behold, Then in this place the solemn Rites we'l hold. Oroo. That sight wou'd cancel all that's due from me, And from this gen'rous Act wou'd set me free, When you take back the life that you did give, And in ten thousand Deaths wou'd make me live, Alex. Then your own time for your departure take; All shall be granted for Statira's sake; And for her self, thou mayest behold her here; But henceforth, as a Star, above thy Sphere, Where she shall raign the Queen of all the world. Oroo. First let my Soul be to the Furies hurld. Lys. Still in this Circle doest thou safe remain. [to Ephestion. Exeunt Alexander leading Statira, Ephestion and Lysimachus striving both to lead Parisatis. Manent Oroondates, Araxis, and Scythian Ambassadours. Oroo. She's gone for ever, all my hopes are vain; I'me backwards dash'd upon the Sea again; The wealth I thought I had, I did not hold, As Misers dream, and think they grasp their Gold; So the tir'd wretch with swimming looking round, Prepares his feet in hopes to touch the Ground, But finding none he straight is sunk, and drown'd. Ara. T'were fit you talk'd of something that procures A grateful peace with your Ambassadours. Oroo. These are the furies of the peoples Brain, That dare to sit upon a Monarchs raign; Not all the fire, nor all the feinds of Hell Can Act the rage that in Plebeians dwell; When they are mad and know not what 'tis for, Like winds they bustle, and like Waves they roar; On those above 'em look with Envies stings, And mad because they cannot all be Kings: Ara. At Kings they let their gorged stomachs fly, Belching out treason, sprung from Luxury, Behold with censures still bright Majesty; As base Astronomers look up and pry Into the Glorious Planets of the sky. Oroo. Mercy the curse of Monarchs in this age, That breeds this plague, that shou'd be quell'd by rage;â I'le like a Lion shake my angry Locks And fright the Souls out of this Coward Herd, And make them put their Necks into their Yoaksâ Amb. Great Princeâ Oroo. Be goneâYou shall have your rewardâ You thought me dead, or els from pow'r debar'd;â I'le send you home with Chaines upon your feet, With that reward you shall your Masters greet. [Exeunt Amb. bowing Ara. What shall we do Sir? shall we go or stay To morrow is the great, and fatal day, That takes your Love, more than your life away Oroo. I'le stay, and dare the worst till it be past, Till Love in spite has thrown his utmost cast; Then as the Body of on sense bereft, Increases in the other senses left, Honour shall side and help the weaker part, And rouze with Noble deeds my sinking heart. I'le follow Armes till my loud Fame shall prove As great a Rival to him, as my Love: His Jealous soul shall fly to find me out, Through all Loves Charms that fence his heart about. Re-enter to them Lysimachus. Lys. When shall this breast be free from Jealous pain? Ye Gods! Am I prevented once again? Oroo. My Eyes deceive me, if it be not true, You are Lysimachus, to whom all worth is due. Lys. The brave, and valiant Oroondates you, Whose mighty mind above the fates aspire, Heav'n cannot lend a grace to mount it higher; The greatest Lover, and the bravest Man, That dares doe more than Alexander can. Oroo. You make me blush at what I can't deserve; Such praise my modesty must not observe. Lys. Cease Oroondates; mark the threatning shower That hangs o're usâTo morrow brings the hour, When both our Loves shall feel Tyrannick power. Besides your self, there is one wretched more, Who Parisatis does in vain adore; Yet there's a glimpse of hope my fate procures, Which I will follow, that is not in yours: Statira ne're can hope to be your wife; Without attempt on Alexander's life: The Gods protect the greatest King from harms; But had Ephestion Parisatis hand, Though bound by Hymenyal sacred Charmes; Without the aw of Duty or command, I'de snatch him out of hers, and Alexander's Armes. [Re-enter to them Ephestion. Look where this lov'd Ephestion does appear. Oroo. Let him not see that we are talking here. Lys. This moment is an Age while you retire. Exeunt Oroondates, and Araxis. Eph. Lysimachus, I come at your desire; I read your looks and understand your sign, And hope you did not misinterpret mine; Though you have call'd me from my only bliss, And greatest pleasure that on Earth there is. Lys. For all that I can say, it is decreed, That you'l run on, and Love with fatal speed. Eph. To morrow e're the Sun forsakes the Morne, A bride shall be by Parisatis worne, And thou a poor neglected Rival burn. The Gods with musick of the sphere, shall move, And fill the Temple with delights above, To usher Alexander's, and Ephestion's Love. Lys. Tw'ere fit before, that you your self went there, And did in time this Heav'nly Masque prepare; 'Twill ease the Gods of an important care Darest thou defend thy false, and treacherous flame? Eph. Against the Starres in Parisatis name. Lys. Those Starres are angry, and, thy life conspire; Therefore desist, and from her Love retire: Feed not thy youth with such a vain design; For by the Gods, she never shall be thine. Eph. The Gods are pleas'd and will in time fulfill, What they'v decreed in Alexander's will; But you are Mad; I'le give you leave to talk. Lys. Follow me then into the Cyprus walk. Eph. Go on; I fear not all thy strength, and ods. Lys. Nor I, wert thou the Minion of the Gods. Eph. I follow theeâMay Parisatis charmes Crown but my Love, as Love shall Crown my Arms. [Exeunt Omnes. Finis Actus Quarti.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus ScÃ¦na. Prima. Alexander discover'd in torment, Statira, Bagistanes, And Captains. Alex. O there it went, and struck through ev'ry part; The hand that from my Bosom pul'd a Dart Ne're felt me tremble with the sudain smart; But this like lightening parches every vein, And lends to death a thousand speares in pain. What have I done ye Gods that you give o're? Was I so great that I cou'd be no more? Great Jove, did my vast name so ponderous stand, Not to be fix'd by thy immortal hand? EphestionâAh the Torment that I feel; The world turnes guiddy and begins to reel, Leans on one side, and shewes its fatal keel Sta. Heav'n keep the thought of treason from your mind; The Gods be to your noble life more kind; I wish by Methres I had bin your wife, Rather than you shou'd think I hate your life. Alex. Far be my soul from such a thought possest, That Sin should dwell in your Illustrious breast. Sta. Ah may you find more worlds, and them subdue, If you can be so kind to think me true. Alex. Most generous Princess, by the Gods I do: All that besides a God can feel, I'le bear, And think no mortal man such treason dare; If such a Monster on the Earth were bred. Through all my pangs of Death, I'de look him dead. I'de pull back life, and wou'd that strength recall, Which held the world, and on his head wou'd let it fall. Bag. Send for Physitians Sir, to give you ease, That will consult, and find out your disease. Alex. That were to storm my life with greater force; Physitians were invented for a Curse, To plague Mankind, and make diseases worse. Phil. Who knowes, but your distemper is the same, When after bathing in cold Cydnus Flood, No sooner you out of the water came, But such unusual paines did seise your Blood. Alex. Oh there it hit me with a fatal blow; That when I'de hold of life, it made me bow, Loosing my hands and faintly let it goâ EphestionâWhere's Ephestion?âRun, straight, fly; Shall I not see Ephestion ere I dy? What have you done with him? Go fetch him straight;â D'ye stand?âGo fetch him e're it be too late. [Exit one of the Captaines, Alex. turnes to Statira weeping Strange tickling paines through all my senses creep, With joy in Anguish bred, to see you weep.â O save those tears you shed, each pretious drop, The wealth thereof a sinking State wou'd prop. Sta. Weak, and defenceless my poor grief appears; Cou'd I but with these Floods your paines disperse; I'de melt my heart, and weep it out in tears,â Alex. My dear Ephestion I shall never find! Sta. How fares that heart, the greatest of Mankind? Alex. As he whose spirit does contemn his fate, Bearing a heavy burthen on his Back, Stretches, and rises with the mighty weight: Such strength brave minds from their misfortunes take.â Madam, the time will come that I'le ly low; This lofty tow'ring Pinacle must bow, And you'l be rid of this great Man that made a show; As a bright Star, the darling of the sky, That you behold so glorious, and so high, Drops on a sudain from your wondering Eye. Sta. Oh say not so, unless you take me too, Or stay you here and let me dy for you. Alex. I will not dy: You'l see that I can rise, Blest by your hand, and guided by your Eyesâ [Alex. rises up supported by Statira. Ephestion come, we will new worlds obtain, Let loose the old and hunt it o're again. Enter to them Ephestion wounded, led in by Parisatis, and a Captain. Ephestion and Parisatis sit down on one side of Alexander, and Statira on the other Eph. O bear me quickly; do not let me stayâ But if you stir you take my life away. [to Par. Offering to unhand him. Break wretched heart, 'Tis time for thee to endâ Ephestion's dearest soul; Ephestion's Friend; [throwes himself on Alex. What ails the joy of Men, and Gods above? Speak dearest of my heart, dearer than Love. Alex. He's faint, and pale, and his poor heart does bleedâ It streamesâO Gods! Who did this bloody deed? Traitors of Hell, y'ave shew'd your utmost wrath.â Ephestion! soul, there's treason on us both. I can the Authour of My death forgive; But he that kill'd Ephestion shall not live. That God who raign'd auspitious at my birth, [Offers to rise Lend me the strength, with which I held the Earth; Cassander, and my Bands of Macedon, I'le fetch my self, and kill' em ev'ry one. Eph. Ah sit you still, and rest this Noble heart; You than my wounds do give a greater smart. Lysimachus I urg'd this wound to make, And we both fought for Parisatis sake. Alex. Lives 'e ye Gods? Go fetch him instantly; Let me the pleasure have to see him dy, Then let my soul with satisfaction fly,â Now, now a thousand daggers peirce my skull: Restless, as on a Bed of spikes I roll. Yet I will bear it, by the Gods I can; I'le live to have you all condemn'd and slain, If they'l not grant Ephestion's health again. Eph. Ah mind not mine, whiles you neglect your own; Long may you live, and Guide us like the Sun, And we shine by your light, as does the Moon. Leave not the world to be by fate betraid, And us to dwell in everlasting shade. Ah Parisatis!â Let not my Rival shew the King his face; But keep him ever in that blessed space, Safe in the circled Armes of your embrace; The Gods should not have forc'd me from that place Had I been thereâ Par. I'le pull him from my Breast,â And you shall dwell my soul's Eternal Guest. Alex. Statira! Oh Ephestion, how I burn! Sta. Ye Gods! Now all my griefes again return! I did not think there cou'd be yet a cross, That I cou'd mourn after Darius loss. Eph. Ah Parisatis!â It is in vain, the pity you impart; My death admits of Rivals by no Art.â Give me your handâThe Gods are so severe, [to Par. To grant life hence; but then to snatch it here. [to Alex. Look down O heav'n and your own Actions mourn; Releive the greatest Man that e're was born. Thou great, thou only excellently good, Heres Love, and freindship swallow'd in a Flood, And drown'd in stormes of sighes, and tears of blood O the last drop that trickles from my heart! I wish ye Gods, 'twere Nectar to his smart. [fainting Alex. He's goneâsee too the furious and rebellious Sun, Slave to the many Battails I have won, Ha's in this very moment broke his chain, And in revenge shot all his fire into my Brain. The Gallant Eagle too, that o're my head, So oft in sign of Victory has fled, Shook with the terrour of my fate, lyes dead. I'le search Joves Lap, where brighter Eagles are,â 'Tis a great wayâI'le mount on yonder Star.â See Madam, see, above the blew pav'd sky, Do you not see my dear Ephestion fly? Eph. Lo dearest Son of Phillip, here am I: I'le rob once more this treasure of my health. And safely in his bosom lodge the wealth, Stealing to him insensibly this kiss, And in his breast will transmigrate the bliss, [Eph. kisses Paris. hand, then turns to Alex. See thou belov'd thy Macedonian Boy, Brings the last fruites of his expiring joy. Think who thou art, thou Royal Son of Jove; Revive that heart, that does Ephestion Love; See I can never from this Center move. Alex. Ah my Ephestion, art thou yet alive! What sawcy Spirit told me thou wert dead? Eph. I will not dye if thou wilt cease to grieve, But live to see more Crowns adorn your head: May ne're such Love their frozen spirits warm, That did the God-like Alexander harm. How fares my heart? How favours i'ts disease? Alex. Believe me Boy that I am all o're ease; The thoughts of this does ev'en deaths horrour please. I will Lysimachus his Pardon give, And will do any thing, if, thou wilt live: Thou art my darling hopes; if thou art slain, When I am dead, who shall the world maintain? Or who for these fair Queens, Darius loss regain? Enter to them Lysimachus threatning the Guards, who keep off. Lys. Be goneâWho does not instantly depart, By all the Gods, this dagger's in his heart. I need no Guards to call my duty home; Faster I'le fly, than you can make me come. Ah Sir believe me I my life despise; Think you I'le live to see death close your Eyes? Down at your feet your faithful Subject lyes, Whose life for you's an humble sacrifice. I did Ephestion wound, and that I did, I beg that I may suffer for the deed. [Lys. kneels. Par. Thou mighty soul, look with a gracious Eye; [Sta. and Par. kneels Ah pardon him, and be a God more high,â See who 'tis kneels, Statira 'tis and I. Sta. Breath life, thou great, and only God-like man. Alex. Spare him that style, who nothing does nor can. My mind indeed, that struggles with my fate, But holds my shatter'd purposes too late, Shews I am Alexander yet, but no more great. Eph. By all the dearest Love that dwelt in us, Forgive, forgive the brave Lysimachus. Alex. And doest thou beg his fatal lifes reprieve.â [to Eph. Rise then, and thanks to poor Ephestion give. [to Lys. Lys. Still I am curst and have no right to breath, Nor wish to live till you are free from death; Thou more Illustrious than the God of war, Dark as in hell we all benighted are, To see thee drop down from us like a falling Star. Enter to them Cassander supported by two of the Guards. Cass, Quick, quickly bear me e'reâ I sink into the Concaves of the Earth. Eph. What horrid scene of death is this? What birth Has the base world in this one day of fate brought forth? Alex. Thou look'st as if this Tale thou woud'st unfold, Be breif Cassander, thou wert ever bold. Cass. I by the fury of thy fate am hurl'd, And sent to fetch thee to another world. Does not th'Ambition start, to here it fai'd, New wreathes of Conquests shall adorn thy head, Lawrels that time ne're kills, nor envy fades, But flourish thick in everlasting shades, 'Tis past thy own proud heart to be againâ By Jove, great Alexander thou art slain; Thou canst not live an hourâ Eph. Forbid O heaven!â Sta. And the all mighty Sun.â Eph. Unsay what thou hast said.â Alex. Let him go on.â Cass. Hadst thou a thousand lives to guard thy soul, In Hercules his cup th'ast lost 'em all, And drown'd thy self in that immortal bowl. This in revenge of blood the Gods have done, Much for the world, but more for Macedon, For Clytus, brave Parmenio, and his Son. Eph. Where was this treason damn'd in Hell begot? Alex. Live, and discover who was in the plot. Cass. Tis he whose name shall never be forgot, But live, when by this deed his does expire That did Diana's Temple set on fire; With greif, that he did touch this man of heaven, To whom rich Nature all her stock has given, Consulting those above, who joyn'd to fit. Thy soul for all things admirably great; Till so injust, and fall'n to that degree, Thou most ingratfully a God would'st be, And Phillip for thy Father didst disown, Lifting to heav'n thy humble Macedon; Kill'd thy best ferinds that all thy faults wou'd shew, And none but to curst flatterers wou'dst Bow; Ravish'd the widdows teares, and virgins smiles, And all the wealth of nature turn'd to spoyles; Led by a whore, to gratifie thy lust, Didst turn the fam'd Persepolis to dust. Lys. Ah let me send him to eternall night. Alex. Still let him rail; I'le hear him with delight, And dare death, and the villaines utmost spite. Cass. Thou like a Plague wert through all Nations sent, Till the kind Gods in pity now relent, And throw away their wrathful instrument. I kill'd thee, and do glorying in it dy, To have it said hereafter, this did I, Nor wou'd the Credit of't for life exchange; For I have done it in the worlds revenge: And this cou'd never be too dearly bought, Therefore my self has pledg'd thee in a larger draught. Alex. Base dog, thou in thy latest breath doest ly; I scorn to dy the death that thou shalt dy.â Bring him to me, to put him out of doubt, Crush him, till he shall spue his poyson out; Then kill himâNo. but be a killing still, An Age, till I from heav'n descend, and tell, What new found plagues shall scourge his soul in Hell. Eph. Ah where's the place from whence our soules do meet, I'le suck the poyson out, and call it sweet. [Whiles the Guards offer to seize Cass. he makes a motion to stab himself. Cass. It is in vain; for though my life be short, I'le hasten it, and o'pe another port. Alex. Guid my remaining strength, this darted Rodâ Thus aim'd I, and thus struck I like a God, [Alex. throwes a dart, and kills Cassander. Cass. Thou hast but spurr'd my life that else was free; This is the only stroak I car'd to see, And is the last I e're shall take from thee. Prepare ye Gods, and make us mighty Room. For Alexander, and his fate are come. [Cassander dyes. Eph. How clouded o're with guilt his soul does flye, Like gloomy night, and darkens all the sky Alex. The Villain has said true; I must depart. I sensibly perceive the poys'nous smart Burnes in my Brain, and feedes upon my heart; The cursed Juice will not it self confine, But in a moment more will break the mine. Eph. Your words like death through all my veins disperse; You kill me quite at what you do rehearse: If you but talk of dying, I'le make hast And shun that sight; I cannot be the last; You shake the Glass that else does run too fast. I'le tear these Wounds, and spoil the surgeons art, And kill my self, er'e you from me depart. Can you so cruel be, such thoughts to own, To leave your dear Ephestion here alone? Leave, let me goâTo stay this threatning harm, And save the widow'd world, the Gods will arm. Alex. Ah spare more words, that speed thy parting breath; Thy Love augments the danger of thy death: Look up Ephestion, see who's by thy side; Fate cannot either of our soules divide; Our lives together in one chain are ty'd. Eph. I will, I will, ev'n my last look afford; As long as I can live, I'le keep my word; But dy I must, and then I'le mount all prayer; If there's a God will lend a feeling Eare, I'le charm the deity, till I can gain Immortal pitty to asswage your pain. The dark, and secret book of Fate I'le read, And know what of the world's great King's decreed. Alex. Now I begin to surfeit with the drink. Eph. Is there no aid? O speak, oh do, O think.â Chill death shall quickly freeze up all my veines, Like icecles I'le drop upon thy scorching painesâ Come close thou dearâThus gently as we twine, When I am dead, lay my cold brest to thine, And there, in spite of all thy fire, I'le freeze, As snow upon the burning Ãtna lyes. [Eph. begins to faint Alex. Stay pretious Boy, another look restore; Spare but my happiness one moment moreâ Ah 'tis not I, 'tis thou that art unkind; And cruel too, to leave me here behindâ Stay my soules soul, there is some hope remaines; These floods of grief have quench'd my scorching paines; I am not sick, my senses all are free, And feel no burning, but with Love of thee. Eph. Ah let me go before it be too late For heaven to punish thy unlucky fateâ Happy Lysimachus, my Rival bee, In her, but him you must not envy me, Alex. A thousand Adders bask within my skul, With heat ingender, all my Braines are fullâ Where is Ephestion? Have you let him go?â O for a world; a world made up of snow How I cou'd plunge, till I did melt it down, And make more havock than the scorching Sun. Sta. Ah say y'are well or make him so believe. For 'tis in search of you his senses grieve. Alex. See, see the Battailes JoynâBeat, beat the Drumes, BucephÃ¦lus inrag'd he champs and foames; Darius with his hooked Charriots comes.â Wheres old Parmenio? Let more Trumpets sound; How his proud horse does beat the fearful ground! Haste, hasteâEphestion's routed in the wing,â Now, now they have inclos'd him in a Ringâ Heark how they shout, and clap their hands for joy, The Gods have ravish'd my beloved Boy! Eph. Look dearest Alexander, yet I liveâ This is a greater stroak than death can give. Lys. Ah Royal Sir, stay till you have decreed, Who o're the mighty world shall you succeed. Alex. A deadly frost hath peirc'd my senses through; O! I am fall'n int'an Abysse of snow Something like cold dew-drops about my heart does move Warme me Ephestion, warme me with thy Love. The worthyst man amongst you shall be King; To him that ownes that title give this Ring. Yet somewhat else there is I'me proud to do; That is Statira, to be just to youâ Be you of all your fathers Crownes possest, And be you too with Oroondates blest.â Sta. Ah hold, with kindness now you wound me more, Than all your presecution did before; Witness ye Gods, to whom my soul is known, With how much sorrow I embrace my own. Eph. Now ends his roughness in a calm delight; As westerne windes are often laid at night: Thus silent falls the sweetest of mankind, Softer than blossomes carried by the wind! Alex. Now let us mount, and then for ever joyn, Like the twin-starres, that do together shine; Still guiding o're the world our heav'nly parts; Whilest I rule Monarchs; thou shalt govern hearts. Eph. Come Alexander then, if we must go, Let's Raign above, and make a glorious show. [Eph. kisses Par. hand, then turns to Alex. Farwell thou dearest LoveâCome dearest friend;â Thus like too Cherubims we'l both ascend; Whiles guarded so, by friendship, and by Love, We go prepar'd to meet the joyes above. Alex. Why wilt thou dy? with thee's all sweetness gone; More rare than Persia offers to i'ts Sun The Violets perfum'd, and purple crest, Or PhÅnix burning it 'its spicey nest, Breath not so sweet an odour, as thy Breast. Eph. Now, now my spirit 'sore my Ey-sight sweepesâ Let us begin our Journy on our Lipps. [they kisse. Alex. This kisse in which thy latest Breath does fleet, No dew that falls from heav'n is half so sweetâ Stay, stayâI will not let thee get the startâ Take all with thee, each Atome of my heartâ Now, now I have thee just before my Ey;â Ephestion, nowâ Eph. Now let's together flyâ [both dy Phil. Now I am sure that the great deed is done, I'l haste and tell the news in Macedon. [exit Par. He's goneâ Sta. He's gone, the life-spring of us allâ A heav'nly Legion waits his soul in view. What miseries shall all mankind befall! Lys. Nature shou'd melt it self into a dew, And the whole world into disorder fall. And mourn in Chaos at thy funeral. Stat. He is not dead, or I am not aliveâ It cannot beâ Lys. Cease Madam, cease to grieveâ Bag. What shall we do? Ah, what is to be done? Lys. Call all the Captaines, call 'em every one Tell 'em the worlds, and their great Master's gone. [Exit Bagistanes. Bear forth Cassander's Bodyâ Which limb from limb wild horses having tore, Then let his scatter'd joynts the Dogs devour. [Cassander's Body is carried forth Enter to them Oroondates, and Araxis, Ah Oroondates you are come too lateâ Behold the sad great Miracle of fate. Oroo. Too soon I fear to such a dismal sight, The news whereof did my firme soul a fright; What, is he dead? By heaven he is not sure! Thus look'd he, the same awful visage wore, When he dispers'd with wonder Love, and power.â See too, the richest fruit of Natures pride, And mourning Love lyes bleeding by his side.â How do the Gods like Children with us play! First shew the world in splendour, fine, and gay, Then on a suddain snatch the gawdy Toy away. This who like Heav'n peirc'd thunder most divine, And lightned where the Sun durst never shine. That div'd through all the secrets of the Earth; Saw more than ever yet did humane Birth, Does fall i'th' Crowd, and undistinguish'd pass; Leaving but fame, that such a man there was. Ah my Statira! weep no more divine; I did not think such showers cou'd cloud thy shine, And dark the day, when I shou'd call thee mine. Instead of Alexander, heav'n does lend Lysimachus, our brave, and noble Freind. Sta. Who wou'd not shrink at such a day of doome? Lys. Spare Love a while, and when the Captaines come, We'l straight to Councel; then if I have power, To Parisatis I will Persia's Crown restore To give to whom she pleaseâ Par. If this be trueâ I with my self, will give it back to you. Lys. You when you please, shall then to Scythia go, And bright Statira your lov'd Queen indow. Oroo. Now I will call thee Brotherâ Lys. But how dearâ [looking on the Bodyes We purchase pleasure, almost with despair.â Re-enter to them Bagistanes with the Captaines, making a full stage. See Valiant, souldiers; look with wonder there. Omnes. O horrour! Plagues! Revenge!â Cap. H'as such a dreadâ We dare not look upon him now he's dead, But as on Gods with reverent surprise, And pay our Adorations from our Eyes. Cap. We hear Antipater has late rebell'd; And as all Greece his King, has took the field. Cap. Now all will outâPhillip they say is fled, And had a hand in this most horrid deed. Lys. I knew Cassander cou'd not this have done, Had not the Father joyn'd in treason with the son.â Straight in the Hall erect a golden Throne; There seat the King all glorious as the sun, A Scepter in his hand, and on his head a Crown. That Throne in which he did commands disperse Through the tam'd world, and aw'd the Universe. Proclaim a loud to heav'ns high Arch, that there, The Deputies of all the world appear, Whilest we in Council sit, agreed in power, To name this mighty man a Successour; Then we will arm for just revenge, and Fame; And conquer still in Alexander's Name. [Exeunt Omnes. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Your looks already have begun to name, Which was the most, we, or the Play too blame: With faults of ours good natures may dispence, But justly tax the Poets want of Sence. That after your lov'd Alexander dare Bring this with all your likings to compare, A Play with Scenes and Acting so admir'd, As if the Souls they play'd had them inspir'd. So 'tis with her that has an ugly face, Proud of false charmes, and her affected grace, Sits by some cry'd up Beauty of the Town, And imitates each glance that's not her own, And when some Gallant from the Pit doth bow, O how she snatches it and court'sies low! The careless Beauty then sits by the while, Kills with a frown and raises with a smile;â Yet this excuse, upon the Authors score, This though come last, was writ a year before. Lik't as you please the great Dons of our House, Themselves would fain have had the Play from us, But frankly and generously our Author stakes His purse and credit rather for our sakes. Be but so kind as he to us has been, In hopes to further merit he'l begin And save the trembling Soul that waits within. To th'Ladies, to you Wits he now does call, For like a drowning man he catches at you all. Spare him this once, and save him now perplext, And he'l turn Bully Poet by the next. FINIS.</field>
