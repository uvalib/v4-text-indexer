Tame: Pray god 't prooue well. Suss: Good morrow Lords. Tame: Good morrow my good Lord of Sussex. Shand: I cry your Honors mercy. Chamb: Good morrow to the Lords of Tame and Shandoyse. Tame: The like to you my Lord: As you were speaking Enter Lord Howard and Sir Henrie Beningfield. Bening: Concerning Wiatt and the Kentish rebels, Their ouer-throw is past: The rebell Dukes that sought By all meanes to proclaime queene Iane cheifly Northumberland For Gilfords sake, he for'st his brother Duke vnto that warre, But each one had his merite. Howard: Oh my Lord, The Lawe proceeded gainst their great offence, And 'tis not well, since they haue suffered Iudgment, That we should rayse their scandall being dead, Tis impious, not by true Iudgment bread. Suss: Good morrow my Lord, good morrow good Sir Henry. Bening: Pardon my Lord I sawe you not till now. Chamb: Good morrow good Lord Howard. Howa: Your honors; The like to you my Lords. Tame: With all my hart Lord Howard. Cham: Forward I pray. Suss: The suffolke men my Lord, was to the Queene The very stayres, by which she did ascend: Shee's greatly bound vnto them for their loues. Enter Cardinall of Winchester. Winch: Good morrow Lords, attend the Queene into the presence. Suss: Your dutyes Lords. Exeunt omnes. Enter Tame bearing the purse: Shandoyse the Mace: Howard the Septer; Sussex the Crowne: then the Queene, after her the Cardinall, Sentlow, Gage, and attendans. Quee: By gods assistance and the power of heauen, We are instated in our brothers throane, And all those powers, that war'd against our right, By helpe of heauen and your freindly ayde, Disper'st and fled, heere may we sit secure, Our heart is ioyfull Lords, our peace is pure. Enter Dodds. Dodds: I doe beseech your maiestie peruse this poore peticion. Quee: O master Dodds we are indebted to you for your loue, You stood vs in great stead even in our ebb Of fortune, when our hopes were neere declin'd, And when our state did beare the lowest saile, Which we haue reason to requit wee know; Read his peticion my good Lord Cardinall. Dodds. Oh gratious soueraigne, let my Lord the Duke haue the Perusing of it, or any other that is neere your grace, He will be to our suit an opposite. Winch: And reason fellow. Madam, here is a large recitall &amp; vpbraydinge of your highnes Soueraignty, the Suffolke men that lifted you to the throne, and heere possest you, claime your promise you made them about religion. Dodds: True gratious Soueraigne; But that we doe vpbraid your maiestie, Or make recitall of our deedes forepast, Other then conscience, honesty and zeale, By loue, by faith, and by our dutie bound, To you the next and true successiue heyre, If you contrary this; I needs must say, Your skillesse tongue doeth make our well tun'd wordes, Iarr in the Princes eares, and of our text, You make a wronge construction: Gratious Queene, Your humble subiects prostrate in my mouth, A generall suit when we first flockt to you, And made first head with you at Fromagbam, Twas thus concluded that we your liegemen Should still enioy our consciences, and vse that faith Which in king Edwards daies was held Canonicall. Winch: May't please your highnes note the Commons insoleuce They tye you to conditions, and set lymits to your liking. Queen: They shall know, To whome their faithfull duties they doe owe, Since they the lymbes, the head would seeke to sway, Before they gouerne, they shall learne t'obay: See it seuerely ordred Winchester. Winch: Away with him, it shalbe throughly scand, And you vppon the pillory, three dayes to stand. Exit Dodds. Benif: Has not your sister (gratious Queene) a hand In these peticions; well your highnes knowes She is a fauorite of these heritiques. Winch: And well remembred, is't not probable, That she in Wiats expedicion, And other insurrection lately queald Was a confederate; if your highnes wil your owne estate preserue, You must foresee fore-danger, and cut off all such As would your safetie preiudice. Bening: Such is your sister, A meere opposite to vs in our opinion, and besides Shees next Successiue, should your maiesty Dye yssules, which heauen defend. Omnes. Which heauen defend. Bening: The state of our religion would decline. Queen: My Lord of Tame and Shandoyse, You two shall haue a firme Commission seal'd, To fetch our sister young Elizabeth From Ashbridge where shee lyes, and with a band Of armed souldiers to conduct her vp to London, Where we will heare her. Sentlo: Gratious Queene, she only craues but to behold your face, That she might cleare her selfe of all supposed treasons, Still protesting, she is as true a subiect to your grace, As liues this day. Winch: Doe not you heare, with what a sawcye impudence, This Sentlow heere presumes. Quee: Away with him, ile teach him know his place, To frowne when we frowne, smile on whome we grace. Winch: Twilbe a meanes to keepe the rest in awe, Making their soueraignes brow, to them a lawe. Quee: All those that seeke our sisters cause to fauour, Let them be lodged. Winch: Young Courtney Earle of Deuonshire, Seemes cheifly to affect her faction. Quee: Commit him to the Tower, Till time affordes vs and our Counsell breathing space. Whence is that Post?

O Lord the house is beset, shouldiers are as hot as fier, Are reddy to enter euerie hole about the howse, For as I was a'th toppe of the stacke, the sound of the Drumme, Hott mee such a box a'th Eare, that I came tumbling downe, The stacke with a thousand byllets a'th top on me, looke about, And helpe for gods sake.

Tame: Goe tell her we must and will. Wom: Ile certifie so much. (Exit Woman Gage: My Lords, as you are honorably borne, As you did loue her father, or her brother, As you do owe alegeance to the Queene, In pitty of her weaknes, and lowe state, With best of fauor, her commisserate. Enter Woman. Wom: Her grace intreates you but to stay till morne? And then your message shalbe heard at full. Shand: Tis from the Queene and wee will speake with her. Wom: Ile certifie so much.

Tame: Doctor Owine and Doctor Wendith, You are the Queenes Phisitions truly sworne, On your alegeance, as before her highnes you will answere it, Speake, may the Princesse be remoou'd with life. D: Owine. Not without danger Lords, yet without death, Her feauer is not mortall; yet you see into what danger, It hath brought the Princesse. Shand: Is your opinion so? D: Wend: My Iudgment is, not deadly, but yet dangerous, No sooner shall she come to take the ayre, But she will faint, and if not well prepar'd and attended, Her life is in much danger. Tame: Madam, we take no pleasure to deliuer so strict a messuage. Eliza: Nor I my Lords to heare a messauge deliuered with such strictnes; well must I goe. Shand: So sayes the Queene.

What are you? 1 Ser: Your howshold Officers and humble seruants, VVho now your house faire Princesse, is desolu'd And quite broke vp, come to attend your grace. Eliz: VVe thanke you, and am more indebted for your loues Than we haue power: or vertue to requite, Alas I am all the Queenes, yet nothing of my selfe, But God and Inocence, be you my Patrons and defend my cause VVhy weepe you gentlemen? Cookes: Not for our selues, men are not made to weepe At there owne fortunes, our cies are made of fire, And to extract water from fire is hard, Nothing but such a Princesse griefe as yours, So good a Ladie &amp; so beautifull, so absolute a mistris, And perfect as you haue deliuered been, Haue power to doo't, your sorrow makes vs sad. Eliz: My Inocence yet makes my hart as light, As my front's heauie: all that heauen sends is welcome Gentlemen diuide these few crownes amongst you, I am now a prisoner; and shall want nothing, I haue some friends about her maiesty, That are prouiding for mee all things; all things; I, euen my graue; and being possest of that, I shall need nothing: weepe not I pray, Rather you should reioyce: If I miscarry in this enterprise, and aske you why, A Virgine and a Martyr both I dy.

Sussex: By your fauour good my Lord ere you proceed, Madam, although this place doth tye you to this reuerence, It becomes not you being a Princesse to deiect your knee, A chaire there. Eliz: My duty with my fortunes do agree, And to the Queene in you I bend my knee. Suss: You shall not kneele where Sussex sits in place, The Chamber keeper, a chaire there for her grace. Winch: Madam, perhaps you censure hardly. That was enforst in this commission. Eliz: Knowe you your owne guilt my good Lord Chancelor, That you accuse your selfe, I thinke not so, I am of this mynd, no man is my foe. Winch: Madam I would you would submit, vnto her highnes. Eliz: Submit my Lord of Winchester, tis fit That none but base offenders should submit, No no my Lord, I easily spy your drifte, Hauing nothing whereon you can accuse me, Do seeke to haue my selfe, my selfe betray, So by my selfe my owne blood should be spilt, Confesse submission I confesse a guilt. Tame: What answere you to Wiats late rebellion, Madam, tis thought that you did set them on. Eliza: Who is't will say so? men may much suspect, But yet my Lord, none can my life detect, I a confederate with those kentish rebells? Yf I ere saw or sent to them, let the Queene take my head, Hath not proud Wyat suffered for his offence, And in the purging both of soule and body for heauen, Did Wyat then accuse Elizabeth? Suss: Madam he did not. Eliz: My reuerent Lord I know it. Howard: Madam he would not. Eliz: Oh my good Lord he could not. Suss: The same day Frogmorton was arrain'd in the Guild-hall, It was impos'd on him, whether this Princesse had a hand With him or no; he did deny it, Cler'd her fore his death, yet accus'd others. Eliz: My god be prays'd, this is newes but of a minute old. Shand: What answere you to Sir Peter Carew in the west, The westerne Rebels. Eliz: Aske the vnborne Infant, see what that will answere, For that and I, are both alike in guilt, Let not by rigor Innocent blood be spilt. Winch: Come Madam, answere breifly to these treasons. Eliz: Treason Lords, if it be treason to be the daughter To th'Eight Henry; Sister to Edward, and the next of blood vnto My gratious soueraigne now the Queene I am a traytor: if not, I Spit at treason. In Henryes raigne this Law could not haue stood, O god that we should suffer for our blood. Const: Madam, the Queene must here you sing another song, Before you parte with vs. Eliz: My god doth know, I can no note but truth, That with heauens King, One day in quiers of Angels I shall singe. Winch: Then Madam you'le not submit. Eliz: My life I will, but not as guilty, My Lords, let pale offendors pardon craue, If we offend, Lawes rigor let vs haue. Winch: You are stubborne, come letts certifie the Queene. Tame: Rowme for the Lords there. (Exeunt Counsell. Eliz: Thou power eternall, Inocents iust guide, That sways the Scepter of all Monarchyes, Protect the guiltlesse from these rauening Iawes, That hidious death presentes, by Tyrants Lawes, And as my hart is knowne to thee most pure, Grant mee release, or patience to endure. Enter Gage and Seruants. Gage: Madam, we your poore humble seruants, Made bold to presse into your graces presence, To know how your cause goes.

Winch: It is the pleasure of her maiestie, That you be straight committed to the Tower. Eliz: The Tower, for what? Winch: Moreouer all your howshold seruants we haue discharg'd, Except this gentleman your vsher &amp; this gentlewoman Thus did the Queene commaund, And for your guard, a hundred Northern whitecotes, Are appoynted to conduct you thither, To night vnto your chamber, to morrow early prepare You for the Tower, your bardge stands ready, To conduct you thyther. (shee kneeles. Eliz: Oh god my hart: A prisoner in the Tower, Speake to the Queene my Lords, that some other place May lodge her sister, that's too vild, too base. Suss: Come my lords, lett's all ioyne in one peticion To the Queene, that she may not be lodg'd within the Tower. Winch: My Lord, you know it is in vaine, For the Queenes sentence is definitiue, And we must see't perform'd. Eliz: Then to our chamber comfortlesse and sad, To morrow to the tower that fatall place, Where I shall neuer behold the sunnes bright face.

(Exeunt omnes. Enter Winchester and Beningfield. Winch: Did you not marke what a pitious eie she cast To the Queens window as she past a long, Fayne she would haue stayd, but that I caus'd The bargmen to make hast and row away. Bening: The bargmen were too desperat my Lord, In staying till the water was so lowe, For then you know, being vnderneath the bridge, The barges sterne did strike vppon the ground, And was in danger to haue dround vs all. Winch: Well she hath scapt that danger, Would she but conforme her selfe in her opinion, She only might rely vppon my loue, To winne her to the fauour of the Queene. Bening: But that will neuer be, this is my censure, If she be guilty in the least degree, May all her wronges suruiue and light on her: If other wayes that she be cleered, Thus both wayes I wish her downe, Or els her state to rayse. Enter Sussex, Tame, Howard, Shandoyse, and Gage. Suss: Why doth the Princesse keepe her barge so longe, Why lands she not? Some one goe see the cause. Gage: That shall be my charge my Lord.

Suss: Oh me my Lords, her state is wondrous hard, I haue seene the day, my hand Ide not haue lent To bring my Soueraignes Sister to the Tower: Good my Lords, stretch your Commission To doe this Princesse but some little fauour. Shand: My Lord, my Lord, let not the loue we beare the Princesse, incurre the Queenes displeasure, tis no dallying with matters of Estate, who dares gaine-say the Queene? Suss: Marry a God not I, no, no, not I; Yet who shall hinder these my eyes to sorrow For her sorrow: By Gods marry deere, That the Queene could not, though her selfe were here: My Lords, my Lords, if it were held fowle treason, To grieue for her hard vsage, by my Soule My eyes would hardly prooue me a true Subiect: But tis the Queenes pleasure, and we must obay: But I shall mourne, should the King and Queene say nay. Enter Gage. Gage. My grieued Mistresse humbly thus intreats, For to remooue backe to the Common stayres, And not to land where Traytors put to shore, Some difference she intreats your Honors make Twixt Christall Fountaines, and fowle muddy Springs, Twixt those that are condemned by the law, And those whome Treasons staine did neuer blemish: Thus she attends your answere, and sits still Whilst her wet eyes, full many a teare did spill. Suss: Marry a God, tis true and tis no reason: Lanch Bargeman, Good Lady land, where Traitors vse to land, And fore her guilt be proou'd, Gods marry no, And the Queene wils it, that it should be so. Shand: My Lord, you must looke into our Commission, No fauors granted, she offorce must land, Tis a decree which we can not with stand, So tell her master Gage, Exit Gage. Suss: As good a Lady as ere England bread, Would he that caus'd this woe, had lost his head. Enter Gage, Elizabeth and Clarentia her gentlewoman. Gage: Madam, you haue stept too short into the water.

Eliza: Then on this stone, this cold stone I will sit, I needes must say you hardly me intreat, VVhen for a chayre, this hard stone is my seate. Suss: My Lord, you deale too cruelly with the Princesse, You knew her father, shee's no stranger to you. Tame: Madam it raynes. Suss: Good Lady take my cloake. Eliz: No let it a lone: See gentle men, The pittious heauens weepes teares into my bosome, On this cold stone I sit, raine in my face, But better heere, than in a worser place VVhere this bad man will lead me. Clarentia, reach my booke, now leade me where you please From sight of day; or in a dungeon; I shall see to pray.

My lord, my lord, you deale without respect, And worse than your Commission can mainetaine. Const. My Lord, I hope I know mine office well, And better than your selfe within this place, Then teach not me my dutie, she shalbe vsd so still, The Queene commands, and Ile obay her will, Suss: But if this tyme should alter, marke me well, Could this be answer'd, could it fellow Peeres? I thinke not so. Const: Tush tush the Queene is young likely to beare, Of her owne body a more royall heyre. Enter Gage. Gage: My Lords the Princesse humbly entreats, That her owne seruants may beare vp her dyet, A company of base vntutord slaues, Whose hands did neuer serue a Princesse boord, Do take that priuiledge. Const: Twas my appoyntment, and it shalbe so. Suss: Gods marry deere, but it shall not be, Lord Howard ioyne with me, weele to the King. Enter souldiers with dishes. Gage: Stay good my Lords for instance, see they come, If this be seemly, let your honors Iudge. Suss: Come come my Lords, why do you staye so long, The Queenes high fauor shall amend this wrong. Const: Now sir, what haue you got by your Exeunt omnes, prÃ¦ter Consta. and Gage. complayning, you common find-fault; what, is your Mistresse stomacke so queasie? our honest souldiers must not touch her meat, then let her fast, I know her stomacke will come downe at last. Enter souldiers with more dishes, Gage takes one from them. Gage: Vntutor'd slaue, Ile ease thee of this burden, Her highnes scornes to touch the dishe Her seruants brings not vp. Const: Presume to touch a dish Ile lodge thee there, Where thou shalt see no sunne for one hole yeare. Gage: I would to god you would, in any place (Exit Const: &amp; souldiers. Where I might liue from thought of her disgrace, O thou all-seeing heauens, with pitious eies, Looke on th'oppressions of their cruelty! Let not thy truth, by falshood be opprest, But let her vertues shyne and giue her rest, Confound the sleights, and practise of those men, Whose pride do kicke against thy seat of heauen. Oh draw the courtaines from their filthy sinne, And make them loath the hell which they liue in. Prosper the Princesse, and her life defend, A glorious comfort to her troubles send.

Gage: If the Queene please, they shall. A noble and right reuerent Counsellor, Promist to begge it of her Maiestie: And if she say the word, my Lord she shall. Const. I, if she say the word, it shalbe so: My lord of Winchester speakes the contrarie, So doe the Clergie, they are honest men. Gage. My honor'd Lord, why should you take delight To torture a poore Lady innocent? The Queene I know when she shall heare of this, Will greatly discommend your crueltie. You seru'd her father, and he lou'd you well, You seru'd her brother, and he held you deare, And can you hate the sister he best lou'd? You serue her sister, she esteemes you hye, And you may liue to serue her ere you dye: And therefore good my Lord, let this preuaile, Only the casements of her window ope, Whereby she may receiue fresh gladsome ayre. Const. O you preach well to deafe men, no, not I, So letters may fly in, Ile none of that, She'is my prisoner, and if I durst, But that my warrant is not yet so strickt, Ide lay her in a dungeon where her eyes, Should not haue light to read her prayer booke, So would I danger both her soule and body, Cause she an alyen is to vs catholiques, Her bed should be all snakes, her rest dispayre, Torture should make her curse, her faythles prayer. Enter Sussex, Howard, and seruants. Suss: My Lord, it is the pleasure of the Queene, The prisoner Princesse should haue all the vse Of the liestenants garden, the Queenes lodgings, And all the liberty this place affords.

Suss: You may goe aske her and you will my Lord, Moreouer tis her highnes furder pleasure, That her sworne seruants shal attend on her, Two gentlemen of her Ewry, two of her Pantry, Two of her Kitchin, and two of her wardrobe, Besydes this gentleman here master Gage. Const: The next wilbe her freedom, oh this madds me. Howard: Which way lyes the Princesse. Const: This was my Lord. Howard: This wilbe glad tydings: come let's tell her grace. Gage, Wilt please your honor, let my Lady (Exeunt omnes preter Constable &amp; Gage. Walke in the leiftenants garden, Or may but see the lodgings of the Queene, Or ope the casements to receiue fresh ayre, Shall shee my Lord: shall shee this freedom vse, Shee shall: for you can neither will nor chuse, Or shall shee haue some seruants of her owne, To attend on her: I pray let it be so, And let your looke no more poore prisoners daunt, I pray deny not what you needes must grant.

Eliz: Welcome sweet boy, what hast thou brought me there. Boy: Madam, I haue brought you another nose gay, But you must not let it be scene, for if it be, I shall be soundly whipt, indeedla, indeed I shall. Eliz: God a mercy boy, heeres to requite thy loue.

Eliza: Hath he not thinke you a stretch conscience, And if my secret murder should be put into his hands, Hath he not hart thinke you to execute. How: Defend it heauen, and Gods almightie hand, Betwixt your Grace, and such intendments stand. Bening. Come madam will you goe.

Const: My Lord she's factious, rather could I wish She were marryed to some priuat gentleman, And with her dower conuaid out of the land, Then here to stay and be a mutiner, So may your highnes state be more secure. For whilst she liues warres, and commotions, Foule insurrections wilbe set abroch, I thinke 'twere not amisse to take her head: This land would be in quiet, were she dead. Suss: O my Lord, you speake not charitably. Phill: Nor will we Lords embrace his heedles counsell, I doe protest as I am King of Spaine, My vtmost power ile stretch to make them frends, Come Lords let's in, my loue and wit ile try To end this Iarre; the Queene shall not deny.

Tame: And I with you would spend my deerest blood, To do that vertuous Lady any good.

Good Iaylor be not so seuere. Bening: Good mandam I entreate you loose that name Of Iaylor, twilbe a by-word to me and my posterity. Eliz: As often as you name your Commission, So often will I call you Iaylor. Bening: Say I should reach you pen, inke and paper, Who ist dare beare a letter sent from you. Eliz: I do not keepe a seruant so dishonest, That would deny me that. Bening: Who euer dares, none shall. Gage: Madame, impose the letter to my trust, Were I to beare it through a feild of pikes, And in my way ten thousand arm'd men ambusht, Ide make my passage through the mid'st of them, And perforce beare it to the Queene your sister.

Much suspected by me, nothing prou'd can be, Finis quoth Elizabeth the prisoner, Pray god it proue so, soft what book's this, Marry a God, whats here an English bible? Sanctum Maria pardon this prophanation of my hart, Water Barwick, water, Ile meddle with't no more. Eliz: My hart is heauye and my hart doth close, I am weary of writing, sleepy on the sodaine, Clarentia, leaue me, and command some musick In the with-drawing chamber. (shee sleepes.

Did'st not thou put this booke into my hand? Cla: Madame not I. Eliz Then 'twas by inspiration, heauen I trust With his eternall hand, will guide the iust. What chapter's this? Who so putteth his trust in the Lord, Shall not be confounded: My sauiour thankes, on thee my hope I build, Thou lou'st poore Innocents, and art their shield. Enter Beningfeild, and Gage. Bening: Here haue you writ a long excnse it seemes, But no submission to the Queene your sister.

Clowne: So may your worship be for any thing that I know. Bening: VVhat art thou knaue? Clowne: Yf you worship does not remember me, I hope your worships crooper doth: But if you haue any thing to say to this honest fellow, VVho for his gray head and reuerent beard is so like, He may be a kinne to you.

Cla: Better be a Milk-maid free, then a Madame in bondage, Oh had'st thou heard the Princesse yesternight, Sitting within an arbor all alone to heare a Milk-mayd sing, It would haue moou'd a flynty hart to melt, Weeping and wishing, wishing and weeping, A thousand tymes she with her selfe debates, With the poore Milk-maid to exchange estates, Shee was a Sempster in the tower being a Princesse, And shall I her poore gentlewoman, disdayne To be a Milk-maid in the country. Clo: Troth you say true, euery one to his fortune, As men goe to hanging, the tyme hath been, When I would ha scorn'd to carry coles, but now the case is alter'd, Euery man as far as his tallent will stretch.

Quee: Our fauor shalbe farre boue her desert, And she that hath been banisht from the light, Shall once againe behold our cheerfull sight. You my Lord shall step behind the arras, And heare our conference, weele shew her Grace, For there shines too much mercy in your face.

Quee: Sister, I rather thinke they're teares of spleene. Eliz: You were my sister, now you are my Queene. Quee: I, that's your greefe. Eliz. Madame, he was my foe, and not your freind That hath possest you so, I am as true a Subiect to your Grace, as any liues this day, Did you but see, My heart it bends, farre lower than my knee. Quee.

I ioy to haue a sister Queene so royall, I would it as much pleas'd your maiesty, That you enioy a sister that's so true: If I were guilty of the least offence, Madame, 'twould taint the blood euen in your face, The treasons of the father being noble, Vnnobles all your children, let your grace Exact all torture and imprisonment, VVhat ere my greatest enemies can deuise, And they all haue done their worst, yet I VVill your true subiect and true sister dye.

(Exit Eliz: Phil: My soule is ioyfull that this peace is made, A peace that pleaseth heauen and earth, and all, Redeeming captiue thoughts from captiue thrall, Faire Queene, the serious busines of my father, Is now at hand to be accomplished, Of your faire sight needes must take my leaue, Returne I shall, tho parting cause vs greeue. Quee: VVhy should two harts be for'st to seperate, I know your busines but beleeue me sweete, My soule diuines we neuer more shall meete.

Con: VVhere lyes your greife? Winch: VVhere yours and all good subiects els should lye, Neere at the hart, this confirmation I doe greatly dread, For now our true religion will decay, I do diuine who euer liues seauen yeare, Shall see no Religion here but heresye. Bening: Come come my Lord, this is but for a show, Our Queene I warrant wishes in her hart, Her sister Princesse were without her head. Winch: No, no my Lords, this peace is naturall, This combination is without deceyt, But I will once more write to incence the Queene, The plot is laid, thus it shalbe perform'd: Sir Harry, you shall goe attach her seuant Vppon suspition, of some trechery, VVherin the Princesse shalbe accessary, If this do faile, my pollicy is downe, But I grow faynt, the feauer steales on me, Death like a vulture tyres vpon my hart, Ile leaue you two to prosecute this drift, My bones to earth I giue, to heauen my soule lift. (Ex. omnes. Enter Gage and Clarentia. Gage: Madam Clarentia, is my Lady stirring? Cla: Yes master Gage, but heauie at the hart, For she was frited with a dreame this night, She said, she drempt her sister was new married, And sat vpon a high Emperiall throne, That she her selfe was cast into a dungeon, Where enemyes enuiron'd her about, Offering their weapons to her naked brest; Nay they would scarcly giue her leaue to pray, They made such hast to hurry her away. Gage: Heauen sheild my Mistres, and make her frends increase, Conuert her foes, estate her in true peace. Cla: Then did I dreame of weddings, and of flowers, Me thought I was within the finest garden, That euer mortall eie did yet behould, Then strayght me thought some of the cheife were pickt To dresse the bride, O 'twas the rarest show, To see the bride goe smiling longst the streets, As if she went to happynes eternall.

Enter Beningfeild. Ben: My Lord of Sussex I can tell ill newes, The Cardinall Poole that now was firmly well, Is sodenly falne sicke and like to die.

Would he were here now, so my soule were pure, That I with patience might the stroke endure. Gage: Madame I see from farre a horse-man comming, This way he bends his speed he comes so fast, That he is couered in a cloud of dust, And now I haue lost his sight, he appear's againe, Making his way ouer Hill, Hedge, Ditch and Plaine; One after him, they two striue As on the race they had wagerd both their liues, Another after him. Eliz: O God, what meanes this hast? Pray for my soule, my life cannot long last. Gage: Strange and miraculous, the first being at the gate, His horse hath broke his necke, and cast his rider.

God saue the Queene, so all good subiects say: I am her subiect, and for her still pray.

Clow: I, but do not you know the old prouerbe, VVe must liue by the quicke, and not by the dead. Tame: Did you not loue her father when he liu'd, As deerly as you ere did loue any, And yet reioyced at his funerall: Likewise her brother, you esteem'd him deere, Yet once departed, ioyfully you sung, Runne to make Bone-fiers, to proclaime your loue Vnto the newe, forgetting still the old: Now she is gone, how you mone for her, VVere it not fit a while to mone her hearse, And dutyfully there reioyce the tother; Had you the wisest and the louingst Prince, That euer swayd a Scepter in the world, This is the loue he shall haue after life: Let Princes while they liue haue loue or feare 'tis fit, For after death, ther's none continues it. Clo: By my fayth my masters, he speakes wisely, Come weele to the end of the lane, and there weele Make a bonfire and be merry, Fayth agreed ile spend my halfepenny towards Another faggot, rather then the newe Queene shall VVant a Bone-fire.
