      <field name="fulltext">THE HONEST WHORE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS PRIMVS. SCÆNA PRIMA. Enter at one doore a Funerall, a Coronet lying on the Hearse, Scutchins and Garlands hanging on the sides, attended by Gasparo Trebatzi, Duke of Millan, Castruchio, Sinezi. Pioratto Fluello, and others at an other doore. Enter Hipolito in discontented apparance: Matheo a Gentleman his friend, labouring to hold him backe. Duke Behold, yon Commet shewes his head againe; Twice hath he thus at crosse-turnes throwne on vs Prodigious lookes: Twice hath he troubled The waters of our eyes. See, hee's turnde wilde; Go on in Gods name. All On afore there ho Duke Kinsmen and friends, take from your manly sides Your weapons to keepe backe the desprate boy From doing violence to the innocent dead. Hipolito. I pry thee deere Matheo. Matheo. Come, y'are mad. Hip: I do arest thee murderer: set downe. Villaines set downe that sorrow, tis all mine. Duke I do beseech you all, for my bloods sake Send hence your milder spirits, and let wrath Ioine in confederacie with your weapons points; If he proceede to vexe vs, let your swordes Seeke out his bowells: funerall griefe loathes words. All Set on. Hip. Set downe the body. Mat: O my Lord? Y'are wrong: i'th open streete? you see shees dead. Hip: I know shee is not dead. Duke Franticke yong man, Wilt thou beleeve these gentlemen? pray speake: Thou doost abuse my childe, and mockst the teares That heere are shed for her: If to behold Those roses withered, that set out her cheekes: That paire of starres that gave her body light, Darkned and dim for ever: All those rivers That fed her veines with warme and crimson streames, Frozen and dried vp: If these be signes of death, Then is she dead. Thou vnreligious youth, Art not ashamde to emptie all these eyes Of funerall teares, (a debt due to the dead,) As mirth is to the living: Sham'st thou not To have them stare on thee? harke, thou art curst Even to thy face, by those that scarce can speake. Hip. My Lord. Duke What wouldst thou have? is she not dead? Hip. Oh, you ha killd her by your crueltie. Duke Admit I had, thou killst her now againe; And art more savage then a barbarous Moore. Hip. Let me but kisse her pale and bloodlesse lip. Duke O fie, fie, fie. Hip. Or if not touch her, let me looke on her. Math. As you regard your honour. Hip. Honour! smoake. Math. Or if you lov'de hir living, spare her now. Duke I, well done sir, you play the gentleman: Steale hence: tis nobly done: away: Ile ioyne My force to yours, to stop this violent torment: Passe on. Exeunt with funerall. Hip. Matheo, thou doost wound me more. Math. I give you phisicke noble friend, not wounds, Duke Oh well said, well done, a true gentleman: Alacke, I know the sea of lovers rage Comes rushing with so strong a tide: it beates And beares downe all respects of life, of honour, Of friends, of foes, forget her gallant youth. Hip. Forget her? Duke Na, na, be but patient: For why deaths hand hath sued a strict divorse Twixt her and thee: whats beautie but a coarse? What but faire sand-dust are earths purest formes: Queenes bodies are but trunckes to put in wormes. Mathew Speake no more sentences, my good lord, but slip hence; you see they are but fits, ile rule him I warrant ye. I, so, treade gingerly, your Grace is heere somewhat too long already. Sbloud the jeast were now, if having tane some knockes o'th pate already, he should get loose againe, and like a madde Oxe, tosse my new blacke cloakes into the kennell. I must humour his lordship: my lord Hipolito, is it in your stomacke to goe to dinner? Hipolito Where is the body? Matheo The body, as the Duke spake very wisely, is gone to be wormd. Hipolito I cannot rest, ile meete it at next turne, Ile see how my love lookes, Mathæo holds him ins armes Mathæo How your love lookes? worse than a scarre-crowe, wrastle not with me: the great felow gives the fall for a duckat. Hipolito I shall forget my selfe. Mathæo Pray do so, leave your selfe behinde your selfe, and go whither you will. Sfoote, doe you long to have base roags that maintaine a saint Anthonies fire in their noses (by nothing but two peny Ale) make ballads of you? if the Duke had but so much mettle in him, as is in a coblers awle, he would ha beene a vext thing: he and his traine had blowne you vp, but that their powlder haz taken the wet of cowards: youle bleed three pottles of Aligant, by this light, if you follow em, and then wee shall have a hole made in a wrong place, to have Surgeons roll thee vplike a babie in swadling clowts. Hipolito What day is to day, Mathæo? Mathæo Yea mary, this is an easie question: why today is, let me see, thurseday. Hipolito Oh, thurseday. Mathæo Heeres a coile for a dead commoditie, sfoote women when they are alive are but dead commodities, for you shall have one woman lie vpon many mens hands. Hipolito Shee died on monday then. Mathæo And thats the most villainous day of all the weeke to die in: and she was wel, and eate a messe of water-grewel on monday morning. Hipolito I, it cannot be, Such a bright taper should burne out so soone. Mathæo O yes my Lord, so soone: why I ha knowne them, that at dinner have bin aswell, and had so much health, that they were glad to pledge it, yet before three a clocke have bin found dead drunke. Hipolito On thurseday buried! and on monday died, Quicke haste hirlady: sure her winding sheete Was laide out fore her bodie, and the wormes That now must feast with her, were even bespoke, And solemnely invited like strange guests. Mathæo Strange feeders they are indeede my lord, and like your jeaster or yong Courtier, will enter vpon any mans trencher without bidding. Hipolito Curst be that day for ever that robd her Of breath, and me of blisse, hencefoorth let it stand Within the Wizardes booke (the kalendar) Markt with a marginall finger, to be chosen By theeves, by villaines, and blacke murderers, As the best day for them to labour in. If hence foorth this adulterous bawdy world Be got with childe with treason, sacrilege, Atheisme, rapes, treacherous friendship, periurie, Slaunder, (the beggars sinne) lies, (sinne of fooles) Or anie other damnd impieties, On Monday let em be delivered: I sweare to thee Mathæo, by my soule, Heereafter weekely on that day ile glew Mine eie-lids downe, because they shall not gaze On any female cheeke. And being lockt vp In my close chamber, there ile meditate On nothing but my Infælices end, Or on a dead mans scull drawe out mine owne. Mathæo Youle doe all these good workes now every monday, because it is so bad: but I hope vppon tuesday morning I shall take you with a wench. Hipolito If ever whilst fraile bloud through my veins runne, On womans beames I throw affection, Save her thats dead: or that I loosely flie To'th shoare of any other wafting eie, Let me not prosper heaven. I will be true, Even to her dust and ashes: could her tombe Stand whilst I livde so long, that it might rot, That should fall downe, but she be ne're forgot. Mathæo If you have this strange monster, Honestie, in your belly, why so Iig-makers and chroniclers shall picke somthing out of you: but and I smell not you and a bawdy house out within these tenne daies, let my nose be as bigge as an English bag-pudding: Ile followe your lordship, though it be to the place aforenamed. Exeunt. Enter Fustigo in some fantastike Sea-suite at one doore, a Porter meets him at another. Fust. How now porter, will she come? Porter If I may trust a woman sir, she will come. Fust. Theres for thy paines, godamercy, if ever I stand in neede of a wench that will come with a wet finger, Porter, thou shalt earne my mony before anie Clarissimo in Millane; yet so god sa mee shees mine owne sister body and soule, as I am a christian Gentleman; farewell, ile ponder till shee come: thou hast bin no bawde in fetching this woman, I assure thee. Porter No matter if I had sir, better men than Porters are bawdes. Fust. O God sir, manie that have borne offices. But Porter, art sure thou wentst into a true house? Porter I thinke so, for I met with no thieves. Fust. Nay but arte sure it was my sister Viola. Porter I am sure by all superscriptions it was the partie you ciphered. Fust. Not very tall. Porter Nor very lowe, a midling woman. Fust. Twas she faith, twas she, a prettie plumpe cheeke like mine. Porter At a blush, alittle very much like. Fust. Gods so, I woud not for a duckat she had kickt vp hir heeles, for I ha spent an abomination this voyage, marie I did it amongst sailers and gentlemen: theres alittle modicum more porter for making thee stay, farewell honest porter. Porter I am in your debt sir, God preserve you. Exit. Enter Viola. Fu. Not so neither, good porter, gods lid, yonder she coms. Sister Viola, I am glad to see you stirring: its newes to have mee heere, ist not sister? Viola Yes trust me: I wondred who should be so bolde to send for me, you are welcome to Millan brother. Fust. Troth sister I heard you were married to a verie rich chuffe, and I was very sorie for it, that I had no better clothes, and that made me send: for you knowe wee Millaners love to strut vpon Spanish leather. And how does all our friends? Viola Very well; you ha travelled enough now, I trowe, to sowe your wilde oates. Fust. A pox on em; wilde oates, I ha not an oate to throw at a horse, troth sister I ha sowde my oates, and reapt 200. duckats if I had em, heere, mary I must intreate you to lend me some thirty or forty till the ship come, by this hand ile discharge at my day, by this hand. Viola These are your olde oaths. Fust. Why sister, doe you thinke ile forsweare my hand? Viola Well, well, you shall have them: put your selfe into better fashion, because I must imploy you in a serious matter. Fust. Ile sweate like a horse if I like the matter. Viola You ha cast off all your olde swaggering humours. Fust. I had not sailde a league in that great fish-pond (the sea) but I cast vp my very gall. Viola I am the more sory, for I must imploy a true swaggeter. Fust. Nay by this yron sister, they shall finde I am powlder and touch-box, if they put fire once into me. Viola Then lend me your eares. Fust. Mine eares are yours deere sister. Viola I am married to a man that haz wealth enough, and wit enough. Fust. A linnen Draper I was tolde sister. Viola Very true, a grave Citizen; I want nothing that a wife can wish from a husband: but heeres the spite, hee haz not all things belonging to a man. Fust. Gods my life, hee's a verie mandrake, or else (God blesse vs) one a these whiblins, and thats woorse, and then all the children that he gets lawfully of your body sister, are bastards by a statute. Vio: O you runne over me too fast brother, I have heard it often said, that hee who cannot be angry, is no man. I am sure my husband is a man in print, for all things else, save onely in this, no tempest can move him. Fist. Slid, would he had beene at sea with vs, hee should ha beene movde and movde agen, for Ile be sworne la, our drunken ship reelde like a Dutchman. Viola No losse of goods can increase in him a wrinckle, no crabbed language make his countenance sowre, the stubburnnes of no servant shake him, he haz no more gall in him than a Dove, no more sting than an Ant: Musitian will he never bee, (yet I finde much musicke in him,) but he loves no frets, and is so free from anger, that many times I am ready to hire off my tongue, because it wants that vertue which all womens tongues have (to anger their husbands:) Brother, mine can by no thunder: turne him into a sharpenes. Fust. Belike his blood sister, is well brewd then. Viola I protest to thee Fustigo, I love him most affectionately, but I know not—I ha such a tickling within mee—such a strange longing; nay, verily I doo long. Fustigo Then y'are with childe sister, by all signes and tokens; nay, I am partly a Phisitian, and partly something else. I ha read Albertus Magnus, and Aristotles emblemes. Viola Y'are wide ath bow hand still brother: my longings are not wanton, but wayward: I long to have my patient husband eate vp a whole Porcupine, to the intent, the bristling quills may sticke about his lippes like a flemmish mustacho, and be shot at me: I shall be leaner then the new Moone, vnlesse I can make him horne mad. Fust. Sfoote halfe a quarter of an houre does that make him a cuckold. Viola Puh, he would count such a cut no vnkindenes. Fust. The honester Cittizen he, then make him drunke and cut off his beard. Viola Fie, fie, idle, idle, hee's no French-man, to fret at the losse of a little scalde haire. No brother, thus it shall be, you must be secret. Fu. As your Mid-wife I protest sister, or a Barber-surgeon. Viola Repaire to the Tortoys heere in S. Christophers streete, I will send you mony, turne your selfe into a brave man: insteed of the armes of your mistris, let your sword and your militarie scarfe hang about your necke. Fust: I must have a great Horse-mans French feather too sister. Viola O, by any meanes, to shew your light head, else your hat will sit like a coxcombe: to be briefe, you must bee in all points a most terrible wide-mouth'd swaggerer. Fust. Nay, for swaggering points let me alone. Viola Resort then to our shop, and (in my husbands presence) kisse me, snatch rings, jewells, or any things so you give it backe agen brother in secret. Fust: By this hand sister. Viola Sweare as if you came but new from knighting. Fust. Nay, Ile sweare after 400. a yeare. Viola Swagger worse then a Lievetenant among fresh-water souldiers, call me your love, your yngle, your coosen, or so; but sister at no hand. Fust. No, no, It shall be coosen, or rather cuz, thats the gulling word betweene the Citizens wives &amp; their olde dames, that man em to the garden; to call you one a mine aunts, sister, were as good as call you arrant whoore: no, no, let me alone to cosen you rarely. Viola Haz heard I have a brother, but never saw him, therefore put on a good face. Fust. The best in Millan I warrant. Viola Take vp wares, but pay nothing, rifle my bosome, my pocket, my purse, the boxes for mony to dice with all; but brother, you must give all backe agen in secret. Fustigo By this welkin that heere roares? I will, or else let me never know what a secret is: why sister do you thinke Ile cunni-catch you, when you are my coosen? Gods my life, then I were a starke Asse, if I fret not his guts, beg me for a foole. Viola Be circumspect, and do so then, farewell. Fust. The Tortoys sister? Ile stay there; forty duckats. Exit. Viola Thither Ile send: this law can none deny, Women must have their longings, or they die. Exit. Gasparo the Duke, Doctor Benedicke, two servants. Duke Give charge that none do enter, locke the doores, And fellowes, what your eyes and eares receave, Vpon your lives trust not the gadding aire To carry the least part of it: the glasse, the houre-glasse. Doctor Heere my Lord. Duke Ah, tis meere spent. But Doctor Benedick, does your Art speake truth? Art sure the soporiferous streame will ebbe, And leave the Christall banks of her white body (Pure as they were at first) iust at the houre? Doctor Iust at the houre my Lord. Duke Vncurtaine her. Softly sweete Doctor: what a coldish heate Spreads over all her bodie. Doctor Now it workes: The vitall spirits that by a sleepie charme Were bound vp fast, and threw an icie rust On her exterior parts, now gin to breake: Trouble her not my Lord. Duke Some stooles, you calld For musicke, did you not? Oh ho, it speakes, It speakes, watch sirs her waking, note those sands, Doctor sit downe: A Dukedome that should wey mine Owne downe twice, being put into one scale: And that fond desperate boy Hipolito, Making the weight vp, should not (at my hands) Buy her i'th tother, were her stare more light Than hers, who makes a dowrie vp with almes. Doctor Ile starve her on the Appenine Ere he shall marrie her: I must confesse, Hipolito is nobly borne, a man; Did not mine enemies blood boile in his veines, Whom I would court to be my sonne in law? But Princes whose high spleenes for empery swell, Are not with easie arte made paralell. 2 Ser. She wakes my Lord. Duke Looke Doctor Benedick. I charge you on your lives maintaine for truth, What ere the Doctor or my selfe averre For you shall beare her hence to Bergaine Inf. Oh God, what fearefull dreames? Doctor Lady. Inf. Ha. Duke Girle. Why Infalisha, how ist now, ha, speake? Inf. I'me well, what makes this Doctor heere? I'me well. Duke Thou wert not so even now, sicknes pale hand Laid hold on thee even in the deadst of feasting, And when a cap crownde with thy lovers health Had toucht thy lips, a sencible cold dew Stood on thy cheekes, as if that death had wept To see such beautie alterd. Inf. I remember I sate at banquet, but felt no such change. Duke Thou hast forgot then how a messenger Came wildely in with this vnfavorie newes That he was dead. Inf. What messenger? whoes dead? Duke Hipolito, alacke, wring not thy hands. Inf. I saw no messenger, heard no such newes, Doctor Trust me you did sweete Lady. Duke La you now. 2 Servants Yes indeede Madam. Duke La you now, tis well God knowes. Inf. You ha slaine him, and now you'le murder mee. Duke Good Infælishæ vexe not thus thy selfe, Of this the bad report before did strike So coldly to the heart, that the swift currents Of life were all frozen vp. Inf. It is vntrue, Tis most vntrue, O most vnnaturall father? Duke And we had much to do by Arm best cunning, To fetch life backe againe. Doctor Most certaine Lady. Duke Why la you now, you'le not beleeve mee, friends, Sweate we not all, had we not much to do? 2 Ser. Yes indeede my Lord, much. Duke Death drew such fearefull pictures in thy face, That were Hipolito alive agen, Ile kneele and woo the noble gentleman To be thy husband now I fore repent My sharpenes to him and his family; Nay, do not weepe for him, we all must die: Doctor, this place where she so oft hath seene His lively presence, haunts her, does it not? Doctor Doubtlesse my Lord it does. Duke It does, it does. Therefore sweete girle thou shalt to Bergamo. Inf. Even where you will, in any place theres woe. Duke A Coach is ready, Bergamo doth stand In a most wholesome aire, sweete walkes, theres diere, I, thou shalt hunt and send vs venison. Which like some gods in the Caprian groves, Thine owne faire hand shall strike, sirs, you shall teach her To stand, and how to shoote, I, she shall hunt: Cast off this sorrow. In girle, and prepare This night to ride away to Bergamo. Inf. O most vnhappie maid. Exit. Duke Follow it close. No words that she was buried on your lives, Or that her ghost walkes now after shees dead; Ile hang you if you name a funerall. 1 Ser. He speake Greeke my Lord, ere I speake that deadly word. (Exeunt. 2 Ser. And Ile speake Welch which is harder then Greek. Duke Away looke to her Doctor Benedick Did you observe how her complexion altred Vpon his name and death, O would t'were true. Doctor It may my Lord. Duke May? how? I wish his death. Doctor And you may have your wish; say but the word, And tis a strong Spell to rip vp his grave: I have good knowledge with Hipolito; He calls me friend, Ile creepe into his bosome, And sting him there to death; poison can doo't. Duke Performe it; Ile create thee halfe mine heire. Doctor It shall be done, although the fact be fowle. Duke Greatnes hides sin, the guilt vpon my soule. Exeunt Enter Castruchio, Pioratto, and Fluello. Cast: Signior Pioratto, signior Fuello, shalls be merry? shalls play the wags now? Flu: I, any thing that may beget the childe of laughter. Cast: Truth I have a pretty sportive conceit new crept into my braine, will moove excellent mirth. Pio: Lets ha't, lets ha't, and where shall the sceane of mirth lie? Cast. At signior Candidoes house, the patient man, nay the monstrous patient man; they say his bloud is immoveable, that he haz taken all patience from a man, and all constancie from a woman. Flu. That makes so many whoores nowadayes. Cast. I, and so many knaves too. Pio. Well sir. Cast. To conclude, the reporte goes, hees so milde, so affable, so suffering, that nothing indeede can moove him: now do but thinke what sport it will be to make this fellow (the mirror of patience) as angry, as vext, and as maddeas an English cuckolde. Flu. O, twere admirable mirth, that: but how wilt be done signior? Cast. Let me alone, I have a tricke, a conceit, a thing, a device will sting him yfaith, if he have but a thimblefull of blood ins belly, or a spleene not so bigge as a taverne token. Pio. Thou stirre him? thou moove him? thou anger him? alas, I know his approoved temper: thou vex him? why hee haz a patience above mans injuries: thou maiest sooner raise a spleene in an Angell, than rough humour in him: why ile give you instance for it. This wonderfully temperd signior Candido vppon a time invited home to his house certaine Neapolitane lordes of curious taste, and no meane pallats, conjuring his wife of all loves, to prepare cheere fitting for such honourable trencher-men. Shee (just of a womans nature, covetous to trie the vttermost of vexation, and thinking at last to gette the starte of his humour) willingly neglected the preparation, and became vnfurnisht, not onely of dainty, but of ordinary dishes. He (according to the mildenesse of his breast) entertained the lordes, and with courtly discourse beguiled the time (as much as a Citizen might doe:) to conclude, they were hungry lordes, for there came no meate in; their stomackes were plainely gulld, and their teeth deluded, and (if anger could have seizd a man) there was matter enough yfaith to vex any citizen in the world, if hee were not too much made a foole by his wife. Flu. I, Ile sweare for't: sfoote, had it beene my case, I should he playde mad trickes with my wife and family: first I woulde ha spitted the men, stewd the maides, and bak't the mistresse, and so served them in. Pio. Why twould ha tempred any bloud but his, And thou to vex him? thou to anger him With some poore shallow jeast? Cast. Sbloud signior Pioratto, (you that disparage my conceit) ile wage a hundred duckats vppon the head on't, that it mooves him, fretts him, and galles him. Pio. Done, tis a lay, ioyne golls on't: witnes signior Fluello. Cast. Witnes: tis done: Come, follow mee: the house is not farre off. Ile thrust him from his humour, vex his breast, And winne a hundred duckats by one ieast. Exeunt. Enter Candidoes wife, George, and two prentices in the shoppe. Wife Come, you put vp your wares in good order heere, do you not thinke you, one peece cast this way, another that way? you had neede have a patient maister indeede. George I, ile be sworne, for we have a curst mistrie. Wife You mumble, do you mumble? I would your maister or I could be a note more angry: for two patient folkes in a house spoyle all the servants that ever shall come vnder them. 1. prentise You patient!

George What ist you lacke? 2. prentise What ist you buy? Cast. Wheres signior Candido thy maister? George Faith signior, hees a little negotiated, hee'le appeare presently. Cast. Fellow, lets see a lawne, a choice one sitra. George The best in all Millan, Gentlemen, and this is the peece. I can fit you Gentlemen with fine callicoes too for dublets, the onely sweete fashion now, most delicate and courtlie, a meeke gentle calico, cut vpon two double affable taffataes, ah, most neate, feate, and vnmatchable. Flu. A notable-voluble tong de villaine. Pio. I warrant this fellow was never begot without much prating. Cast. What, and is this shee saist thou? George I, and the purest shee that ever you fingerd since you were a gentleman: looke how even she is, look how cleane she is, ha, as even as the browe of Cinthiæ, and as cleane as your sonnes and heires when they ha spent all. Cast. Puh, thou talkst, pox on't tis rough. George How? is she rough? but if you bid pox on't sir, twill take away the roughnesse presently. Flu. Ha signior; haz he fitted your French curse? George Looke you Gentleman, heeres an other, compare them I pray, compara Virgilium cum Homero, compare virgins with harlots. Cast. Puh, I ha seene better, and as you terme them, evener and cleaner. Geor. You may see further for your mind, but trust me you shall not find better for your body. Enter Candido. Cast. O here he comes, lets make as tho we passe, Come, come, weele try in some other shop. Cand. How now? what's the matter? Geor. The gentlemen find fault with this lawne, fall out with it, and without a cause too. Cand. Without a cause! And that makes you to let'em passe away, Ah, may I craue a word with you gentlemen? Flu. He calls vs. Cast. Makes the better for the iest. Cand. I pray come neare, y'are very welcome gallants, Pray pardon my mans rudenesse, for I feare me Ha's talkt aboue a prentice with you, Lawnes! Looke you kind gentlemen-this! no: I this: Take this vpon my honest-dealing faith, To be a true weaue, not too hard, nor slack, But eene as farre from falshood, as from black. Cast. Well, how doe you rate it? Cand. Very conscionably, 18. s.a yard. Cast. That's too deare: how many yards does the whole piece containe thinke you? Cand. Why, some 17. yardes I thinke, or there abouts, How much would serue your turne? I pray. Cast. Why let me see-would it were better too. Cand. Truth, tis the best in Millan at fewe words. Cast. Well: let me haue then-a whole penny-worth. Cand. Ha, ha:y'are a merry gentleman. Cast. A pennorth I say. Cand. Of lawne! Cast Of lawne? I of lawne, a pennorth, sblood dost not heare? a whole pennorth, are you deaffe? Cand. Deaffe? no Syr: but I must tell you, Our wares doe seldome meete such customers. Cast. Nay, and you and your lawnes be so squemish, Fare you well. Cand. Pray stay, a word, pray Signior: for what purpose is it I beseech you? Cast. Sblood, whats that to you: Ile haue a penny worth. Can. A penny-worth! why you shall: Ile serue you presently. 2. Pren. Sfoot, a penny-worth mistris! Mist. A penny-worth! call you these Gentlemen? Cast. No, no: not there. Can. What then kinde Gentle-man? what at this corner here? Cast. Nor nor there neither. Ile haue it iust in the middle, or els not. Can. Iust in the middle: ha you shall too: what? Haue you a single penny? Cast. Yes, heeres one. Can. Lend it me I pray. Flu. An exlent followed iest. Wife What will he spoile the Lawne now? Can. Patience, good wife. Wife I, that patience makes a foole of you: Gentlemen, you might ha found some other Citizen to haue made a kind gull on, besides my husband. Can. Pray Gentlemen take her to be a woman, Do not regard her language.—O kinde soule: Such words will driue away my customers, Wife Customers with a murr?: call you these customers? Can. Patience, good wife. Wife Pax, a your patience. Geor. Sfoot mistris, I warrant these are some cheating companions. Can.

Wife You had need so. Pio. Harke in thine eare, thast lost an hundred duckets. Cast. Well, well, I knowt: ist possible that Homo, Should be nor man, nor woman: not once mooud; No not at such an iniurie, not at all! Sure hees a pigeon, for he has no gall. Flu. Come, come, y'are angry tho you smother it: Yare vext ifaith, confesse. Can. Why Gentle-men Should you conceit me to be vext or moou'd? He has my ware, I haue his money fort, And thats no Argument I am angry: no, The best Logitian can not proue me so. Flu. oh, but the hatefull name of a pennyworth of lawne, And then cut out, ith middle of the peece: Pah, I guesse it by my selfe, would moue a Lambe Were he a Lynnen-draper 'twould ifaith. Can. Well, giue me leaue to answere you for that, Were set heere to please all customers, Their humours and their fancies: offend none: We get by many, if we leese by one. May be his minde stood to no more then that, A penworth serues him, and mongst trades tis found, Deny a pennorth, it may crosse a pound. Oh, he that meanes to thriue with patient eye, Must please the diuell, if he come to buy. Flu. O wondrous man, patient boue wrong or woe, How blest were men, if women could be so. Can. And to expresse how well my brest is pleasde, And satisfied in all: George. fill a beaker. Exit George. Ile drinke vnto that Gentleman, who lately Bestowed his mony with me. Wife Gods my life, We shall haue all our gaines drunke out in beakers, To make amends for penny worths of lawne. Enter Georg. Can. Here wife, begin you to the Gentleman. Wife I begin to him. Can. George, filt vp againe: Twas my fault, my hand shooke. Exit George. Pio. How strangely this doth showe? A patient man linkt with a waspish shrowe. Flu. A siluer and gilt beaker: I haue a tricke to worke vp on that beaker, sure twil fret him, it cannot choose but vexe him. Seig. Castraichio, in pittie to thee, I haue a c?ceit, wil saue thy 100. Duckets yet, twil doot, &amp; work him to impatience. Cast. Sweet Fluello, I should be bountiful to that conceit. Flu. Well tis enough. Enter George. Can.

Farewell Candido. Cand. Y'are welcome gentlemen. Cast. Heart not mou'd yet? I thinke his patience is aboue our wit, Geor. I told you before mistresse, they were all cheaters. (Exeunt. Wife Why foole, why husband, why madman, I hope you will not let'em sneake away-so with a siluer and gilt beaker, the best in the house too: goe fellowes make hue and cry after them. Cand. Pray let your tongue lye still, all wil be well: Come hither George, hye to the Constable, And in calme order wish him to attach them, Make no great stirre, because they're gentlemen, And a thing partly done in meriment, Tis but a size aboue a iest thou knowst, Therefore pursue it mildly, goe be gone, The Constabl's hard by, bring him along, make hast againe. Wife O y'are a goodly patient Woodcocke, are you not now? (Exit George. See what your pati?ce comes too: euery one sadles you, and rydes you, youle be shortly the common stone-horse of Myllan: a womans well holp't vp with such a meacocke, I had rather haue a husband that would swaddle me thrice a day, then such a one, that will be guld twice in halfe an hower, Oh I could burne all the wares in my shop for anger. Cand. Pray weare a peacefull temper, be my wife, That is, be patient: for a wife and husband Share but one soule between them: this being knowne, Why should not one soule then agree in one? (Exit. Wife Hang your agreements: But if my beaker be gone. Enter Castruchio, Fluello, Pioratto, and George. Cand. Oh, heare they come. Geor.

Sheart! attach vs! Cand. Nay sweare not gallants, Your oathes may moue your soules, but not moue me, You haue a siluer beaker of my wiues. Flu. You say not true: tis gilt. Cand. Then you say true. And being gilt, the guilt lyes more on you. Cast. I hope y'are not angry syr. Cand. Then you hope right, for I am not angry. Pio. No, but a little mou'de. Cand. I mou'd! twas you were mou'd, you were brought hither. Cast. But you (out of your anger &amp; impatience,) Caus'd vs to be attacht. Cand. Nay you misplace it. Out of my quiet sufferaence I did that, And not of any wrath, had I showne anger, I should haue then pursude you with the lawe, And hunted you to shame, as many worldlings Doe build their anger vpon feebler groundes, The mores the pitty, many loose their liues For scarce so much coyne as will hide their palme: Which is most cruell, those haue vexed spirits That pursue liues, in this opinion rest, The losse of Millions could not moue my brest. Flu. Thou art a blest man, and with peace dost deale, Such a meeke spirit can blesse a common weale. Cand. Gentlemen, now tis vpon eating time, Pray part not hence, but dyne with me to day. Cast. I neuer heard a carter yet say nay To such a motion. Ile not be the first. Pio. Nor I, Flu. Nor I, Cand. The constable shall beare you company, George call him in, let the world say what it can, Nothing can driue me from a patient man. (Exeunt.

But I must tell you Lady, were you mine, You should be all mine: I could brooke no sharers, I should be couetous, and sweepe vp all. I should be pleasures vsurer: faith I should. Bell. O fate! Hipo. Why sigh you Lady? may I knowe? Bell. T'has neuer bin my fortune yet to single Out that one man, whose loue could fellow mine. As I haue euer wisht it: ô my Stars! Had I but met with one kind gentleman, That would haue purchacde sin alone, to himselfe, For his owne priuate vse, although scarce proper: Indifferent hansome: meetly legd and thyed: And my allowance reasonable-yfaith, According to my body-by my troth, I would haue bin as true vnto his pleasures, Yea, and as loyall to his afternoones, As euer a poore gentlewoman could be. Hipo. This were well now, to one but newly fledg'd, And scarce a day old in this suttle world: Twere prettie Art, good bird-lime, cunning net: But come, come, faith-confesse: how many men Haue drunke this selfe-same protestation, From that red tycing lip? Bell. Indeed not any. Hipo. Indeed? and blush not! Bell. No, in truth not any. Hipo. Indeed! in truth! how warily you sweare? Tis well: fill it be not: yet had I The ruffian in me, and were drawne before you But in light cullors, I doe know indeed, You could not sweare indeede, But thunder oathes That should shake heauen, drowne the harmonious sphers, And pierce a soule (that lou'd her makers honour) With horror and amazement. Bell. Shall I sweare? Will you beleeue me then? Hipo. Worst then of all, Our sins by custome, seeme (at last) but small. Were I but o're your threshold, a next man, And after him a next, and then a fourth, Should haue this golden hooke, and lasciuious baite, Throwne out to the full length, why let me tell you: I ha seene letters sent from that white hand, Tuning such musicke to Matheos eare. Bell. Mathæo! thats true, but beleeue it, I No sooner had laid hold vpon your presence, But straight mine eye conuoid you to my heart. Hipo. Oh, you cannot faine with me, why, I know Lady, This is the common passion of you all, To hooke in a kind gentleman, and then Abuse his coyne, conueying it to your louer, And in the end you shew him a french trick, And so you leaue him, that a coach may run Betweene his legs for bredth. Bell. O by my soule! Not I: therein ile proue an honest whore, In being true to one, and to no more. Hipo. If any be disposde to trust your oath, Let him: ile not be he, I know you feine All that you speake, I: for a mingled harlot, Is true in nothing but in being false. What! shall I teach you how to loath your selfe? And mildly too: not without sense or reason. Bell. I am content, I would faine loath my selfe, If you not loue me. Hipo. Then if your gratious blood be not all wasted, I shall assay to doo't. Lend me your silence, and attention, you haue no soule, That makes you wey so light: heauens treasure bought it, And halfe a crowne hath sold is: for your body Is like the common shoare, that still receiues All the townes filth. The sin of many men Is within you, and thus much I suppose, That if all your committers stood in ranke, Theide make a lane, (in which your shame might dwell) And with their spaces reach from hence to hell. Nay, shall I vrge it more, there has bene knowne, As many by one harlot, maym'd and dismembred, As would ha stuft an Hospitall: this I might Apply to you, and perhaps doe you right: O y'are are as base as any beast that beares, Your body is ee'ne hirde, and so are theirs. For gold and sparkling iewels, (if he can) Youle let a Iewe get you with christian: Be he a Moore, a Tartar, tho his face Looke vglier then a dead mans scull, Could the diuel put on a humane shape, If his purse shake out crownes, vp then he gets, Whores will be rid to hell with golden bits: So that y'are crueller then Turkes, for they Sell Christians onely, you sell your selues away. Why those that loue you, hate you, and will terme you Lickerish damnation: wish themselues halfe sunke After the sin is laid out, and ee'ne curse Their fruitlesse riot, (for what one begets Another poisons) lust and murder hit, A tree being often shooke, what fruit can knit? Bell. O me vnhappy! Hip. I can vexe you more; A harlot is like Dunkirke, true to none, Swallowes both English, Spanish, fulsome Dutch, Blacke-doord Italian, last of all the French, And he sticks to you faith: giues you your diet, Brings you acquainted, first with monsier Doctor, And then you know what followes. Bell. Misery. Ranke, stinking, and most loathsome misery. Hip. Me thinks a toad is happier then a whore, That with one poison swells, with thousands more The other stocks her veines: harlot? fie! fie, You are the miserablest Creatures breathing, The very slaues of nature: marke me else, You put on rich attires, others eyes weare them, You eat, but to supply your blood with sin, And this strange curse ee'ne haunts you to your graues. From fooles you get, and spend it vpon slaues: Like Beares and Apes, y'are bayted and shew tricks For money; but your Bawd the sweetnesse licks. Indeed you are their Iourney-women, and doe All base and damnd workes they list set you to: So that you n'ere are rith; for doe but shew me, In present memory, or in ages past, The fayrest and most famous Courtezan, Whose flesh was dear'st; that raisd the price of sin, And held it vp; to whose intemperate bosome, Princes, Earles, Lords, the worst has bin a knight, The mean'st a Gentleman, haue offred vp Whole Hecatombs of sighs, &amp; raind in showres Handfuls of gold, yet for all this, at last Diseases luckt her marrow, then grew so poore, That she has begd, e'ene at a beggers doore. And (wherin heau'n has a finger) when this Idoll, From coast to coast, has leapt on forrayne shores, And had more worship, th? th'outlandish whores; When seuerall Nations haue gone ouer her, When for eache seuerall City she has seene, Her Maydenhead has bin new, &amp; bin sold deare: Did liue wel there, &amp; might haue dyde vnknown, And vndefam'd; back comes she to her owne, And there both miserably liues and dyes, Scornd euen of those, that once ador'd her eyes, As if her fatall-circled life, thus ranne, Her pride should end there, where it first began. What do you weepe to heare your Story read? Nay, if you spoyle your cheeks, Ile read no more. Bel. O yes, I pray proceed: Indeed 'twill do me good to weepe indeed. Hip. To giue those teares a rellish, this I adde, Y'are like the Iewes, scatterd, in no place certain, Your daies are tedious, your houres burdensome: And wer't not for full suppers, midnight Reuels, Dauncing, wine, ryotous meetings, which doe drowne, And bury quite in you all vertuous thoughts, And on your eye-lids hang so heauily, They haue no power to looke so high as heauen, Youde sit and muse on nothing but despayre, Curse that deuil Lust, that so burnes vp your blood, And in ten thousand shiuers breake your glasse For his temptation. Say you taste delight, To haue a golden Gull from rize to Set, To meat you in his hote luxurious armes, Yet your nights pay for all: I know you dreame Of warrants, whips, &amp; Beadles, and then start At a dores windy creake: thinke euery Weezle To be a Constable: and euery Rat A long tayld Officer: Are you now not slaues? Oh you haue damnation without pleasure for it! Such is the state of Harlots. To conclude, When you are old, and can well paynt no more, You turne Bawd, and are then worse then before: Make vse of this: farewell. Bel. Oh, I pray stay. Hip. See Matheo comes not: time hath bard me, Would all the Harlots in the towne had heard me. Exit. Bel. Stay yet a little longer, no: quite gone! Curst be that minute (for it was no more. So soone a mayd is chang'd into a Whore) Wherein I first fell, be it for euer blacke; Yet why should sweet Hipolito shun mine eyes; For whose true loue I would becom pure-honest, Hate the worlds mixtures, &amp; the smiles of gold: Am I not fayre? Why should he flye me then? Faire creatures are desir'd, not scornd of men. How many Gallants haue drunk healthes to me, Out of their daggerd armes, &amp; thought th? blest, Enioying but mine eyes at prodigall feasts! And does Hipolito detest my loue? Oh, sure their heedlesse lusts but flatered me, I am not pleasing, beautifull nor young, Hipolito hath spyed some vgly blemish, Eclipsing all my beauties: I am foule: Harlot! I, that's the spot that taynts my soule: What! has he left his weapon heere behind him, And gone forgetfull? O fit instrument To let forth all the poyson of my flesh! Thy M. hates me, cause my bloud hath rang'd: But wh? tis forth, then heele beleeue I me ch?ng'd. Hip. Mad woman, what art doing? Enter Hipo. Bel. Eyther loue me, Or split my heart vpon thy Rapiers poynt: Yet doe not neyther; for thou then destroyst That which I loue thee for (thy vertues) here, here, Th'art crueller, and kilst me with disdayne: To die so, sheds no bloud, yet tis worse payne. Exit Hipol. Not speake to me! not bid farewell! a scorne! Hated! this must not be, some meanes Ile try. Would all Whores were as honest now, as I. Exeunt. SCENA 7. Enter Candido, his wife, George, and two Prentices in the shop: Fustigo enters, walking by. Geor. See Gentlemen, what you lack? a fine Holland, a fine Cambrick, see what you buy. 1. Pr.

Angry? not I sir, nay, if she can part So easily with her Ring, tis with my heart. Geo. Suffer this, sir, &amp; suffer all, a whoreson Gull, to—, Can. Peace, George, wh? she has reapt what I haue sown, Sheele say, one grayne tastes better of her owne, Then whole sheaues gatherd from anothers land: Wit's neuer good, till bought at a deare hand. Geo. But in the meane time she makes an Asse of some body. 2. Pren. See, see, see, sir, as you turne your backe, they doe nothing but kisse. Cand. No matter, let 'em: when I touch her lip, I shall not feele his kisses, no nor misse Any of her lip: no harme in kissing is. Looke to your businesse, pray, make vp your wares. Fust.

Do you heare sir? y'are best be quiet, &amp; say a foole tels you so. Fust. Nailes, I think so, for thou telst me. Can. Are you angry sir, because I namde the foole? Trust me, you are not wise, in mine owne house; And to my face to play the Anticke thus: If youle needs play the madman, choose a stage Of lesser compasse, where few eyes may note Your actions errour; but if still you misse, As heere you doe, for one clap, ten will hisse. Fust. Zwounds Cozen, he talks to me, as if I were a scuruy Tragedian. 2. pren. Sirra George, I ha thought vpon a deuice, how to breake his pate, beat him soundly, and ship him away. Geor. Doo't. 2 Pre. Ile go in, passe thorow the house, giue some of our fellow Prentices the watch-word when they shal enter, then come &amp; fetch my master in by a wile, and place one in the hall to hold him in conference, whilst we cudgell the Gull out of his coxcombe.

Sister and brother, brother to my wife. Fust. If you haue any skill in Heraldry, you may soone know that, break but her pate, and you shal see her blood and mine is all one. Can. A Surgeon, run, a Surgeon: Why then wore you that forged name of Cozen? Fust. Because its a common thing to call Coz, and mingle now adayes all the world ouer. Cand. Cozen! A name of much deceyt, folly and sin, For vnder that common abused word, Many an honest tempred Cityzen Is made a monster, and his wife traynd out To foule adulterous action, full of fraud, I may well call that word, A Cities Bawd. Fust. Troth, brother, my sister would needs ha me take vpon me to gull your patience a little: but it has made double Gules on my coxcomb. Wife What, playing the woman? blabbing now you foole? Cand. O, my wife did but exercise a iest vpon your wit. Fust. Sfoot, my wit bleeds for't, me thinks. Cand. Then let this warning more of sence afford. The name of Cozen is a bloudy word. Fust.

Go with the Surgeon to haue great respect. How now, my friend, what, do they sit to day? Off. Yes sir, they expect you at the Senate-house. Can. I th?k your paines, Ile not be last man there. Exit Off. My gowne, George, goe, my gowne. A happy land, Where graue men meet each cause to vnderstand, Whose consciences are not cut out in brybes, To gull the poore mans right: but in euen scales, Peize rich &amp; poore, without corruptions veyles. Come, wheres the gowne? Ge. I cannot find the key sir. Cand. Request it of your mistris. Wife Come not to me for any key. Ile not be troubled to deliuer it. Cand. Good wife, kind wife, it is a needfull trouble, but for my gowne. Wife Mothes swallow downe your gowne: you set my teeth an edge with talking on't. Cand. Nay prythee, sweet, I cannot meet without it, I should haue a great fine set on my head. Wife Set on your coxcomb: tush, fine me no fires. Can. Beleeue me (sweet) none greets the Senate-house, without his Robe of reuerence, that's his Gowne. Wife Wel, then y'are like to crosse that custome once, You get nor key, nor gowne, and so depart: This trick will vexe him sure, and fret his heart. Exit. Cand. Stay, let me see, I must haue some deuice, My cloke's too short: fy, fy, no cloke will doo't: It must be something fashioned like a gowne, With my armes out: oh George, come hither George, I prythee lend me thine aduice. Geor. Troth sir, were it any but you, they would break open chest. Cand. O no, breake open chest! thats a Theeues office: Therein you counsell me against my bloud: 'Twould shew impatience that, any meeke meanes I would be glad to imbrace. Masse I haue got it: Go, step vp, fetch me downe one of the Carpets, The saddest colourd Carpet, honest George, Cut thou a hole ith middle for my necke, Two for mine armes, nay prithee looke not strange. Geor. I hope you doe not thinke sir, as you meane. Cand. Prithee about it quickly, the houre chides me: Warily George, softly, take heed of eyes, Exit George. Out of two euils hee's accounted wise, That can picke out the least; the Fine imposde For an vn-gowned Senator, is about Forty Cruzadoes, the Carpet not 'boue foure. Thus haue I chosen the lesser euill yet, Preseru'd my patience, foyld her desperate wit. Geor. Here, sir, heer's the Carpet. Enter George. Cand. O well done, George, weele cut it iust ith midst: Tis very well I thanke thee, helpe it on. Ge. It must come ouer your head, sir, like a wenches peticoate. Cand. Th'art in the right, good George, it must indeed. Fetch me a nightcap: for Ile gyrd it close, As if my health were queazy: 'twill show well For a rude carelesse night-gowne, wil't not thinkst? Ge. Indifferent wel, sir, for a night-gowne, being girt &amp; pleated. Cand. I, and a night-cap on my head. Ge. Thats true sir, Ile run &amp; fetch one, &amp; a staffe. Exit Ge. Cand. For thus they cannot chuse but conster it, One that is out of health, takes no delight, Weares his apparell without appetite, And puts on heedles rayment without for me. Enter Geo. So so, kind George, be secret now: &amp; prithee do not laugh at me till Ime out of sight. Geo. I laugh? not I sir. Cand. Now to the Senate-house: Me thinks, Ide rather weare, without a frowne, A patient Carpet, then an angry Gowne. Exit. Ge.

Heere, take this key, thou knowst where all things lie, Put on thy masters best apparell, Gowne, Chayne, Cap, Ruffe, euery thing, be like himselfe, And 'gainst his comming home, walke in the shop, Fayne the same cariage, and his patient looke, 'Twill breed but a iest thou knowst, speake, wilt thou? Geor. 'Twill wrong my masters patience. Wi. Prythee George. Geor. Well, if youle saue me harmlesse, and put me vnder couert barne, I am content to please you, prouided it may breed no wrong against him. Wi. No wrong at all: here take the Key, be gone: If any vex him, this: if not this, none Exeunt. SCENA 8. Enter a Bawd and Roger. Bawd. O Roger, Roger, where's your mistris, wher's your mistris? there's the finest, neatest Gentleman at my house, but newly come ouer: O where is she, where is she, where is she? Rog. My mistris is abroad, but not amongst em: my mistris is not the whore now that you take her for. Baw. How? is she not a whore? do you go about to take away her good name, Roger? you are a fine Pandar indeed. Rog. I tell you, Madona Finger-locke, I am not sad for nothing, I ha not eaten one good meale this three &amp; thirty dayes: I had wont to get sixteene pence by fetching a pottle of Hypocras: but now those dayes are past: we had as good doings, Madona Finger-locke, she within dores and I without, as any poore yong couple in Millain. Baw. Gods my life, and is she chang'd now? Rog. I ha lost by her squeamishnesse, more then would haue builded 12. bawdy houses. [Baw.] And had she no time to turn honest but now? what a vile woman is this? twenty pound a night, Ile be sworne, Roger, in good gold and no siluer: why here was a time, if she should ha pickt out a time, it could not be better! gold ynough stirring; choyce of men, choyce of haire, choyce of beards, choyce of legs, and choyce of euery, euery, euery thing: it cannot sink into my head, that she should be such an Asse, Roger, I neuer beleeue it. Rog. Here comes now. Enter Bellafronte. Baw. O sweet Madona, on with your loose gowne, your felt &amp; your feather, there's the sweetest, proprest, gallantest Gentleman at my house, he smells all of Muske &amp; Amber greece, his pocketfull of Crownes, flame-colourd dublet, red satin hose, Carnation silk stockins, and a leg and a body, oh! Bel. Hence, thou our sexes monster, poysonous Bawd, Lusts Factor, and damnations Orator, Gossip of hell, were all the Harlots sinnes Which the whole world conteynes, numbred together, Thine farre exceeds them all; of all the creatures That euer were created, thou art basest: What serpent would beguile thee of thy Office? It is detestable: for thou liu'st Vpon the dregs of Harlots, guard'st the dore, Whilst couples goe to dauncing: O course deuill! Thou art the bastards curse, thou brandst his birth, The lechers French disease; for thou dry-suckst him: The Harlots poyson, and thine owne confusion. Baw. Mary come vp with a pox, haue you nobody to raile against, but your Bawd now? Bel. And you, Knaue Pandar, kinsman to a Bawd. Rog. You and I Madona, are Cozens. Bel. Of the same bloud and making, neere allyed, Thou, that slaue to sixpence, base-mettald villayne. Rog. Sixpence? nay that's not so; I neuer took vnder two shillings foure pence, I hope I know my fee. Bel. I know not against which most to inueigh: For both of you are damnd so equally. Thou neuer spar'st for oathes: swearst any thing, As if thy soule were made of shoe-leather. Goddam me, Gentleman, if she be within, When in the next roome she's found dallying. Rog. If it be my vocation to sweare, euery man in his vocation: I hope my betters sweare and dam themselues, and why should not I? Bel. Roger, you cheat kind gentlemen? Rog. The more gulls they. Bel. Slaue, I casheere thee. Baw. And you do cashe ere him, he shalbe entertaynd. Rog. Shall I? then blurt a your seruice. Bel. As hell would haue it, entertaynd by you! I dare the deuill himselfe to match those two. Exit. Baw. Mary gup, are you growne so holy, so pure, so honest with a pox? Rog. Scuruy honest Punck! But stay Madona, how must our agreement be now? for you know I am to haue all the commings in at the hall dore, &amp; you at the chamber dore. Ba. True Rog. except my vailes. Rog. Vailes, what vailes? Ba. Why as thus, if a couple come in a Coach, &amp; light to lie down a little, then Roger, thats my fee, &amp; you may walk abroad; for the Coach man himselfe is their Pandar. Ro. Is a so? in truth I haue almost forgot, for want of exercise: But how if I fetch this Citizens wife to that Gull, &amp; that Madona to that Gallant, how then? Ba. Why then, Roger, you are to haue sixpence a lane, so many lanes, so many sixpences. Ro. Ist so? th? I see we two shall agree and liue together. Ba. I Roger, so long as there be any Tauernes and bawdy houses in Millain. Exeunt. SCENA 9. Enter Bellafronte with a Lute, pen, inke and paper being placde before her. Song. The Courtiers flattring Iewels, (Temptations onely fewels) The Lawyers ill-got monyes, That sucke vp poore Bees Honyes: The Citizens sonne's ryot, The gallant costly dyet: Silks and Veluets, Pearles and Ambers, Shall not draw me to their Chambers. Shee writes. Silks and Veluets, &amp;c. Oh, tis in vayne to write: it will not please, Inke on this paper would ha but presented The foule blacke spots that sticke vpon my soule, And rather make me lothsomer, then wrought My loues impression in Hipolitoes thought. No, I must turne the chaste leaues of my brest, And pick out some sweet meanes to breed my rest. Hipolito, beleeue me I will be As true vnto thy heart, as thy heart to thee, And hate all men, their gifts and company. Enter Matheo, Castruchio, Fluello, Pioratto. Mat. You, goody Punck, subandi Cockatrice, O yare a sweet whore of your promise, are you not think you? how wel you came to supper to vs last night: mew, a whore &amp; breake her word! nay you may blush, &amp; hold downe your head at it wel ynough: Sfoot, aske these gallants if we staid not till we were as hungry as Seriants. Flu. I, and their Yeoman too. Cast. Nay fayth Acquaintance, let me tell you, you forgat your selfe too much: we had excell?t cheere, rare vintage, and were drunke after supper. Pior. And when wee were in our Woodcocks (sweete Rogue) a brace of Gulles, dwelling here in the City, came in &amp; payd all the shot. Mat. Pox on her, let her alone. Bel. O, I pray doe, if you be Gentlemen: I pray depart the house; beshrew the dore For being so easily entreated: fayth, I lent but little eare vnto your talke, My mind was busied otherwise in troth, And so your words did vnregarded passe: Let this suffice, I am not as I was. Flu. I am not what I was! no Ile be sworne thou art not: for thou wert honest at fiue, &amp; now th'art a Puncke at fifteene: thou wert yesterday a simple whore, and now th'art a cunning Conny-catching Baggage to day. Bel. Ile say Ime worse, I pray forsake me then, I doe desire you leaue me, Gentlemen, And leaue your selues: O be not what you are, (Spendthrifts of soule and body) Let me perswade you to forsake all Harlots, Worse th? the deadliest poysons, they are worse: For o're their soules hangs an eternall curse, In being slaues to slaues, their labours perish, Th'are seldome blest with fruit; for ere it blossoms, Many a worme confounds it. They haue no issue but foule vgly ones, That run along with them, e'ene to their graues: For stead of children, they breed ranke diseases, And all, you Gallants, can bestow on them, Is that French Infant, which n'ere acts but speaks: What shallow sonne &amp; heire then, foolish gall?t, Would waste all his inheritance, to purchase A filthy loathd disease? and pawne his body To a dry euill: that vsurie's worst of all, When th'interest will eate out the principall. Mat. Sfoot, she guls em the best: this is alwaies her fashion, when she would be rid of any company that she cares not for, to inioy mine alone. Flu. Whats here? instructions, Admonitions, and Caueats? come out, you scabberd of vengeance. Mat. Fluello, spurne your hounds when they fyste, you shall not spurne my Punk, I can tell you my bloud is vext. Flu. Pox a your bloud? make it a quarrell. Mat. Y'are a Slaue, will that serue turne? Omn. Sbloud, hold, hold, Cast. Matheo, Fluello, for shame put vp. Mat. Spurne my sweet Varlet! Bel. O how many thus Mou'd with a little folly, haue let out Their soules in Brothell houses, fell downe and dyed Iust at their Harlots foot, as 'twere in pride. Flu. Matheo, we shall meet. Mat. I, I, any where, sauing at Church: pray take heed we meet not there. Flu. Adue, Damnation. Cast. Cockatrice, farewell. Pi. There's more deceit in women, then in hel. Exeunt, Mat. Ha, ha, thou doest gull em so rarely, so naturally: if I did not think thou hadst bin in earnest: thou art a sweet Rogue for't ifayth. Bel. Why are not you gone to, Signior Matheo? I pray depart my house: you may beleeue me, In troth I haue no part of Harlot in me. Mat. How's this? Bel. Indeed I loue you not: but hate you worse Then any man, because you were the first Gaue money for my soule; you brake the Ice, Which after turnd a puddle: I was led By your temptation to be miserable: I pray seeke out some other that will fall, Or rather (I pray) seeke out none at all. Mat. Ist possible, to be impossible, an honest whore! I haue heard many honest wenches turne Strumpets with a wet finger; but for a Harlot to turne honest, is one of Hercules labours: It was more easie for him in one night to make fifty queanes, then to make one of them honest agen in fifty yeeres: come, I hope thou doost but iest. Bel, Tis time to leaue off iesting, I had almost Iested away Saluation: I shall loue you, If you will soone forsake me. Mat. God buy thee. Bel. Oh, tempt no more wom?: shun their weighty curse, Women (at best) are bad, make them not worse, You gladly seeke our sexes ouerthrow: But not to rayse our states for all your wrongs. Will you vouchsafe me but due recompence, To many with me? Mat. How, marry with a Punck, a Cockatrice, a Harlot? mary soh, ile be burnt thorow the nose first. Bel. Why ia? these are your othes: you loue to vndo vs, To put heauen from vs, whilst our best houres waste: You loue to make vs lewd, but neuer chaste. Mat. Ile heare no more of this: this ground vpon, Th'art damn'd for altring thy Religion. Exit. Bel. Thy lust and sin speake so much: go thou my ruine, The first fall my soule tooke; by my example I hope few maydens now will put their heads Vnder mens girdels: who least trusts, is most wise: Mens othes do cast a mist before our eyes. My best of wit be ready: now I goe, By some deuice to greet Hipolito. SCENA 10. Enter a seruant setting out a Table, on which he places a scull, a picture, a booke and a Taper. Ser. So, this is Monday morning, and now must I to my huswifry: would I had bin created a Shoomaker; for all the gentle craft are gentlemen euery Monday by their Copy, &amp; scorne (then) to worke one true stitch. My M. meanes sure to turne me into a student; for here's my booke, here my deske, here my light; this my close chamber, and heere my Punck: so that this dull drowzy first day of the weeke, makes me halfe a Priest, halfe a Chandler, halfe a paynter, halfe a Sexton, I &amp; halfe a Bawd: for (all this day) my office is to do nothing but keep the dore. To proue it, looke you, this good-face &amp; yonder gentleman (so soone as euer my back's turnd) wilbe naught together. Enter Hipolito. Hip. Are all the windowes shut? Ser. Close sir, as the fist of a Courtier that hath stood in three raignes. Hip. Thou art a faythfull seruant, and obseru'st The Calender, both of my solemne vowes, And ceremonious sorrow: Get thee gone, I charge thee on thy life, let not the sound Of any womans voyce pierce through that dore. Ser. If they do, my Lord, Ile pearce some of them. What will your Lordship haue to breakfast? Hip. Sighs. Ser. What to dinner? Hip. Teares. Ser. The one of them, my Lord, will fill you too full of wind, the other wet you too much. What to supper? Hip. That which (now) thou canst not get me, the constancy of a woman. Ser. Indeed thats harder to come by then euer was Ostend. Hip. Prythee away. Ser. Ile make away my selfe presently, which few Seruants will doe for their Lords; but rather helpe to make them away: Now to my dore-keeping, I hope to picke something out of it. Exit. Hip. My Infelices face: her brow, her eye, The dimple on her cheeke: and such sweet skill, Hath from the cunning workemans pencill flowne, These lippes looke fresh and liuely as her owne, Seeming to mooue and speake. Las! now I see, The reason why fond women loue to buy Adulterate complexion: here 'tis read, False coulours last after the true be dead. Of all the Roses grafted on her cheekes, Of all the graces dauncing in her eyes, Of all the Musick set vpon her tongue, Of all that was past womans excellence, In her white bosome, looke! a painted board, Circumscribes all: Earth can no blisse affoord. Nothing of her, but this? this cannot speake, It has no lap for me to rest vpon, No lip worth tasting: here the wormes will feed, As in her coffin: hence then idle Art, True loue's best picturde in a true-loues heart. Here art thou drawne sweet maid, till this be dead, So that thou liu'st twice, twice art buried. Thou figure of my friend, lye there. Whats here? Perhaps this shrewd pate was mine enimies: Alas! say it were: I need not feare him now: For all his braues, his contumelious breath, His frownes (tho dagger-pointed) all his plot, (Tho 'nere so mischieuous) his Italian pilles, His quarrels, and (that common fence) his law, See, see, they're all eaten out; here's not left one; How cleane they're pickt away! to the bare bone! How mad are mortals then to reare great names On tops of swelling houses? or to weare out Their fingers ends (in durt,) to scrape vp gould! Not caring so (that Sumpter-horse) the back Be hung with gawdy trappings, with what course, Yea rags most beggerly, they cloath the soule: Yet (after all) their Gay-nes lookes thus foule. What fooles are men to build a garish tombe, Onely to saue the carcasse whilst it rots, To maintein't long in stincking, make good carion, But leaue no good deeds to preserue them sound, For good deedes keepe men sweet, long aboue ground, And must all come to this; fooles; wise, all hether, Must all heads thus at last be laid together: Draw me my picture then, thou graue neate workeman, After this fashion, not like this; these coulours In time kissing but ayre, will be kist off, But heres a fellow; that which he layes on, Till doomes day, alters not complexion. Deaths' the best Painter then: They that draw shapes, And liue by wicked faces, are but Gods Apes, They come but neere the life, and there they stay, This fellow drawes life to: his Art is fuller, The pictures which he makes are without coulour. Enter his seruant. Ser. Heres a person would speake with you Sir. Hip. Hah! Ser. A parson sir would speake with you. Hip. Vicar? Ser. Vicar? no sir, has too good a face to be a Vicar yet, a youth, a very youth. Hip. What youth? of man or woman? lock the dores. Ser. If it be a woman, mary-bones and Potato pies keepe me for medling with her, for the thing has got the breeches, tis a male-varlet sure my Lord, for a womans tayler nore measurd him. Hip. Let him giue thee his message and be gone. Ser. He sayes hees signior Mathæos man, but I know he lyes. Hip. How doest thou know it? Ser. Cause has nere a beard: tis his boy I thinke sir, whosoere paide for his nursing. Hip. Send him and keepe the doore. Reades. Fata fi liceat mihi, Fingere arbitrio meo, Temperem Zephyro leuivela. Ide saile were I to choose, not in the Ocean, Cedars are shaken, when shrubs doe feele no bruize, Enter Bellafronte like a Page. How? from Mathæo. Bell. Yes my Lord. Hip. Art sick? Bell. Not all in health my Lord. Hip. Keepe off. Bell. I do: Hard fate when women are compeld to wooe. Hip. This paper does speake nothing. Bell. Yes my Lord, Matter of life it speakes, and therefore writ In hidden Caracter; to me iustruction My maister giues, And (lesse you please to stay Till you both meet) I can the text display. Hip. Doe so: read out. Bell. I am already out: Looke on my face, and read the strangest story! Hip. What villaine, ho? Enter his seruant. Ser. Call you my Lord? Hip. Thou slaue, thou hast let in the diuell. Ser. Lord blesse vs, where? hees not clouen my Lord that I can see: besides the diuell goes more like a Gentleman than a Page: good my Lord Boon couragio. Hip. Thou hast let in a woman, in mans shape. And thou art dambd for't. Ser. Not dambd I hope for putting in a woman to a Lord. Hip. Fetch me my Rapier,—do not: I shall kill thee. Purge this infected chamber of that plague, That runnes vpon me thus: Slaue, thrust her hence. Ser. Alas my Lord, I shall neuer be able to thrust her hence without helpe: come Mermaid you must to Sea agen. Bell. Here me but speake, my words shall be all Musick: Here me but speake. Hip. Another beates the dore, T'other Shee-diuell, looke. Ser. Why then hell's broke loose. Exit. Hip. Hence, guard the chamber: let no more come on, One woman serues for mans damnation. Beshrew thee, thou doost make me violate, The chastest and most sanctimonious vow, That ere was entred in the court of heauen: I was on meditations spottles wings, vpon my iorney thether; like a storme Thou beats my ripened cogitations, flat to the ground: and like a theife doost stand, To steale deuotion from the holy land. Bel. If woman were thy mother; if thy hart, Bee not all Marble, (or ift Marble be) Let my teares soften it, to pitty me, I doe beseech thee doe not thus with scorne, Destroy a woman. Hip. Woman I beseech thee, Get thee some other suite, this fits thee not, I would not grant it to a kneeling Queene, I cannot loue thee, nor I must not: See, The copy of that obligation, Where my soule's bound in heauy penalties. Bel. She's dead you told me, shele let fal her suite. Hip. My vowes to her, fled after her to heauen, Were thine eyes cleere as mine, thou mightst behold her, Watching vpon yon battlements of starres, How I obserue them: should I breake my bond, This bord would riue in twaine, these wooden lippes Call me most periurde villaine, let it suffice, I ha set thee in the path; Ist not a signe, I loue thee, when with one so most most deare, Ile haue thee fellowes? All are fellowes there. Bel. Be greater then a king, saue not a body, But from eternall shipwracke keepe a soule, If not, and that againe, sinnes path I tread; The griefe be mine, the guilt fall on thy head. Hip. Stay and take Phisicke for it, read this booke, Aske counsell of this head whats to be done, Hele strike it dead that tis damnation, If you turne turke againe, oh doe it not, The heauen cannot allure you to doe well From doing ill let hell fright you: and learne this, The soule whose bosome lust did neuer touch, Is Gods faire bride, and maidens soules are such: The soule that leauing chastities white shore, Swims in hot sensuall streames, is the diuels whore, How now: who comes. Enter his seruant. Ser. No more knaues my Lord that weare smocks: heres a letter from doctor Benedect; I would not enter his man, tho he had haires at his mouth, for feare he should be a woman, for some women haue beardes, mary they are halfe witches, Slid you are a sweete youth to weare a codpeece, and haue no pinnes to sticke vpont. Hip. Ile meete the doctor, tell him, yet to night I cannot: but at morrow rising Sunne I will not faile: go: woman fare thee well. Exeunt. Bel. The lowest fall can be but into hell, It does not moue him. I must therefore fly, From this vndoing Cittie, and with teares, Wash off all anger from my fathers brow, He cannot sure but ioy seeing me new borne, A woman honest first and then turne whore, Is (as with me) common to thousands more, But from a strumpet to turne chast: that sound, Has oft bin heard, that woman hardly found. Exit. 11. SCE. Enter Fustigo, Crambo and Poh. Fus. Hold vp your hands gentlemen: heres one, two, three, (nay I warrant they are sound pistols, and without flawes, I had them (of my sister, and I know she vses to put nothing thats crackt,) three, foure, fiue, sixe, seuen, eight and nine, by this hand bring me but a piece of his bloud. and you shall haue 9. more.

Mary tis the head man; you shall tast him by his tongue a pretty tall prating felow, with a Tuscalonian beard. Po. Tuscalonian: very good. Fust. Cods life I was neere so thrumbd since I was a gentleman: my coxcombe was dry beaten as if my haire had beene hemp. Cram. Wele dry beate some of them. Fust. Nay it grew so high, that my sister cryed murder out very manfully: I haue her consent in a manner to haue him pepperd, els ile not doot to win more then ten cheaters do at a rifling: breake but his pate or so, onely his mazer, because ile haue his head in a cloath a swell as mine, hees a linnen draper and may take enough. I could enter mine action of battery against him, but we may haps be both dead and rotten before the lawyers would end it. Cram. No more to doe, but insconce your selfe i'th taueren; prouide no great cheare, couple of Capons, some Phesants, Plouers, an Oringeado-pie or so: but how bloudy so ere the day be, sally you not forth. Fust. No, no, nay if I stir, some body shal stinke: ile not budge: ile lie like a dog in a manger. Cram. Well, well, to the tauerne, let not our supper be raw, for you shall haue blood enough-your belly full. Fust. Thats all so god same, I thirst after, bloud for bloud, bump for bump, nose for nose, head for head, plaster for plaster, and so farewell: what shal I call your names because ile leaue word, if any such come to the barre. Cram. My name is Corporall Crambo. Poh. and mine, Lieutenant Poh. Exeunt. Cram., Poh. Is as tall a man as euer opened Oyster: I would not be the diuell to meete Poh, farewell. Fust.

The Senate will leaue wording presently: But is George ready, 2. Pre. Yes forsooth, hees furbusht. Wife Now as you euer hope to win my fauour, Throw both your duties and respects on him, With the like awe as if he were your maister, Let not your lookes betray it with a smile, Or ieering glaunce to any customer, Keepe a true Setled countenance, and beware, You laugh not whatsoeuer you heare or see. 2. Pren. I warrant you mistris, let vs alone for keeping our countenance: for if I list, theres neuer a foole in all Myllan shal make me laugh, let him play the foole neuer so like an Asse, whether it be the fat Court foole, or the leane Cittie foole.

Wife Girt about him like a mad-man: what: has he lost his cloake too: this is the maddest fashion that ere I saw. What said he George when he pasde by thee? Geo. Troth Mistris nothing: not so much as a Bee, he did not hum: not so much as a bawd he did not hem: not so much as a Cuckold he did not ha: neither hum, hem, nor ha, onely starde me in the face, past along, and made hast in, as if my lookes had workt with him, to giue him a stoole. Wi. Sure hees vext now, this trick has mou'd his Spleene, Hees angred now, because he vttred nothing: And wordlesse wrath breakes out more violent, May be heele striue for place, when he comes downe, But if thou lou'st me George, affoord him none. Geo. Nay let me alone to play my maisters prize, as long as my Mistrisse warrants me: Ime sure I haue his best clothes on, and I scorne to giue place to any that is inferiour in apparell to me, thats an Axiom, a principle, &amp; is obseru'd as much as the fashion; let that perswade you then, that lie shoulder with him for the vpper hand in the shop, as long as this chaine will mainteine it.

Let them alone pray, this did me no harme, Troth I was cold, and the blow made me warme, I thanke em for't: besides I had decreed To haue a vaine prickt, I did meane to bleede, So that theres mony sau'd: they are honest men, Pray vse em well, when they appeare agen. Geo. Yes sir, weele vse em like honest men. Cand.

I pray feare nothing, lets alone with him, Signior, you looke not like your selfe me thinkes, (Steale you a tother side) y'are changde, y'are altred. Cand. Changde sir, why true sir, is change strange, tis not the fashion vnlesse it alter: Monarkes turne to beggers; beggers creepe into the nests of Princes, Maisters serue their prentises: Ladies their Seruingmen, men turne to women. Off. And women turne to men. Cand. I, and women turne to men, you say true, ha ha, a mad world, a mad world. Off. Haue we caught you sir? Cand. Caught me: well, well: you haue caught me. Wi.

My Wife sayes so, And what she saye; George, is all trueth you know: And whether now? to Bethlem Monastery?—ha! whether? Off. Faith eene to the mad-mens pound. Cand. A Gods name, still I feele my patience sound. Exe. Geo.

Enter Duke: Doctor: Fluello, Castruchio, Pioratto. Duk. giue vs a little leaue. Doctor your newes. Doc. I sent for him my Lord: at last he came, And did receiue all speech that went from me, As gilded pilles made to prolong his health: My credit with him wrought it: for, some men, Swallow euen empty hookes, like fooles, that feare No drowning where tis deepest, Cause tis cleare: In th'end we sat and eate: a health I dranke To Infælices sweete departed soule, (This traine I knew would take.) Duk. Twas excellent. Doc. He fell with such deuotion on his knees, To pledge the same. Duk. Fond superstitious foole? Doc. That had he beene inflam'd with zeale of prayer, He could not power't out with more reuerence. About my necke he hung, wept on my cheeke, Kist it, and swore, he would adore my lippes, Because they brought forth Infælices name. Duk. Ha, ha, alacke, alacke. Doc. The cup he lifs vp high, and thus he said, Here noble maid: drinkes, and was poisoned. Duk. and died? Doc. And died my Lord. Duk. Thou in that word, Hast peicd mine aged houres out with more yeares, Than thou hast taken from Hipolito, A noble youth he was, but lesser branches Hindring the greaters growth, must be lopt off, And feede the fire: Doctor w'are now all thine, And vse vs so: be bold. Doc. Thankes gracious Lord: My honoured Lord: Duk. hmh. Doc. I doe beseech your grace to bury deepe, This bloudy act of mine. Duk. Nay, nay, for that, Doctor looke you toot: me it shall not moue, Thei'r curst that ill doe, not that ill do loue, Doc. You throw an angry forehead on my face, But be you pleas'd, backward thus for to looke, That for your good, this euill I vndertooke, Duk. I, I, we conster so: Doc. And onely for your loue. Duk. Confest: tis true. Doc. Nor let it stand against me as a bar, To thrust me from your presence: nor beleeue (As Princes haue quicke thoughts,) that now my finger Being deept in blood, I will not spare the hand, But that for gold (as what can golde not doe?) I may be hi'rde to worke the like on you, Duk. Which to preuent. Doc. Tis from my hart as far. Duk. No matter Doctor, cause ile feareles sleepe, And that you shall stand cleare of that suspition I banish thee for euer from my court. This principle is olde but true as fate, Kings may loue treason, but the traitor hate, Exit. Doc. Ist so: nay then Duke, your stale principle With one as stale, the Doctor thus shall quit, He fals himselfe that digs anothers pit, How now: where is he? will he meete me: Enter the Doctors man. Doc. man. meete you sir, he might haue met with three fencers in this time and haue receiued lesse hurt then by meeting one Doctor of Phisicke: why sir has walkt vnder the olde Abbey wall yonder this houre, till hees more colde then a Cittizens country house in Ianiuere, you may smell him behinde sir; la you: yonder he comes. Doc. leaue me. Enter Hipolito. Doc. man. Itch lurch if you will. Exit. Do. O my most noble friend. Hip. Few but your selfe, Could haue inticd me thus, to trust the Aire, With my close sighes, you send for me: what newes? Doc. Come you must doff this blacke: die that pale cheeke, Into his owne colour; goe: Attire your selfe Fresh as a bridegroome, when he meetes his bride, The Duke has done much treason to thy loue, Tis now reuealed, tis now to be reuengde, Be mery honord friend, thy Lady liues. Hip. What Lady? Doc. Infælice, Shees reuiude; Reuiude: alacke! death neuer had the hart, To take breath from her. Hip. Vmh: I thanke you sir, Phisicke prolongs life, when it cannot saue, This helpes not my hopes, mine are in their graue: You doe some wrong to mocke me. Doc. By that loue, Which I haue euer borne you, what I speake Is trueth: the maiden liues: that funerall, Dukes teares, the morning, was all counterfet, A sleepy draught cozend the world and you, I was his minister and then chambred vp, To stop discouery. Hip. O trecherous Duke: Doc. He cannot hope so certainely for blisse: As he beleeues that I haue poysond you, He wode me toot, I yeelded, and confirm'd him, In his most bloudy thoughts. Hip. A very deuill! Doc. Her did he closely coach to Bergamo, And thither? Hip. Will I ride, stood Bergamo, In the low countries of blacke hell, ile to her. Doc. You shall to her, but not to Bergamo, How passion makes you fly beyond your selfe. Much of that weary iourney I'na cut off, For she by letters hath intelligence, Of your supposed death, her owne interment, And all those plots, which that false Duke, (her father) Has wrought against you: And sheele meete you. Hip. O when: Doc. Nay see: how couetous are your desires, Ea ely to morrow morne. Hip. O where good father. Doc. At Bethlem monasterie: are you pleasd now? Hip. At Bethlem monasterie: the place well fits, It is the scoole where those that loose their wits, Practise againe to get them: I am sicke Of that disease, all loue is lunaticke. Doc. Weele steale away, this night in some disguise, Father Anselmo, a most reuerend Frier, Expects our comming, before whom weele lay, Reasons so strong, that he shall yeeld, in bonds, Of holy wedlocke, to tie both your hands. Hip. This is such happinesse: That to beleeue it tis impossible. Doc. Let all your ioyes then die in misbeliefe, I will reueale no more. Hip. O yes good father, I am so well acquainted with despaire, I know not how to hope: I beleeue all. Doc. Weele hence this night, much must be done, much said But if the Doctor faile not in his charmes, Your Lady shall ere morning fill these armes. Hip. heauenly Phisition: far thy fame shall sprede, That mak'st two louers speake when they be dead. Exeunt. Candido's wife, and George: Pioratto meetes them. Wi. O watch good George, watch which way the Duke comes, Geo. Here comes one of the butter flies, aske him. Wi. Pray sir, comes the duke this way. Pio. He's vpon comming mistris. Exit. Wi. I thanke you sir: Geroge are there many madfolkes, where thy Maister lies. Geo. O yes, of all countries some, but especially mad greekes they swarme: troth mistris, the world is altered with you, you had not wont to stand thus with a paper humblie complaining: but you're well enough seru'd: prouander prickt you, as it does many of our Cittie-wiues besides. Wif. Doest thinke George we shall get him forth. Ge. Truly mistris I cannot tel, I thinke youle hardly get him forth: why tis strange! Sfoot I haue known many wom? that haue had mad rascals to their husb?ds, whom they would belabour by all meanes possible to keepe em in their right wits, but of a woman to long to turne a tame m? into a madman, why the diuell himselfe was neuer vsde so by his dam. Wif. How does he talke George! ha! good George tell me. Geo. Why youre best go see. Wif. Alas I am afraid. Geo. Afraid! you had more need be ashamd: he may rather be afraid of you. Wif. But George hees not starke mad, is hee? hee does not raue, hees not horne-mad George is he? Geo. Nay I know not that, but he talkes like a Iustice of peace, of a thousand matters and to no purpose. Wif. Ile to the monastery: I shall be mad till I inioy him, I shalbe sick till I see him, yet when I doe see him, I shall weepe out mine eyes. Geo. I, ide faine see a woman weepe out her eyes; thats as true, as to say, a mans cloake burnes; when it hangs in the water: I know youle weepe mistrisse, but what saies the painted cloth. Trust not a woman when she cryes, For sheele pump water from her eyes, With a wet finger and in faster showers, Then Aprill when he raines downe flowers. Wif. I but George, that painted cloath is worthy to be hangd vp for lying, all women haue not teares at will, vnlesse they haue good cause. Geo. I but mistrisse how easily will they find a cause, and as one of our Cheefe-trenchers sayes very learnedly: As out of Wormwood Bees suck Hony, As from poore clients Lawyers sirke mony, As Parsley from a roasted cunny. So tho the day be nere so sunny, If wiues will haue it raine, downe then it driues, The calmest husbands make the stormest wiues, Wif. Tame George, but I ha don storming now. Geo. Why thats well done, good mistris throw aside this fashion of your humor, be not so phantasticall in wearing it, storme no more, long no more.—This longing has made you come short of many a good thing that you might haue had from my Maister: Here comes the Duke. Enter Duke, Fluello, Pioratto, Sinere. Wife Oh I beseech you pardon my offence, In that I durst abuse your Graces warrant, Deliuer foorth my husband good my Lord. Duke Who is her husband? Flu. Candido my Lord, Duke Where is he? Wif. Hees among the lunaticks, He was a man made vp without a gall, Nothing could moue him, nothing could conuert His meeke bloud into fury, yet like a monster, I often beate at the most constant rock Of his vnshaken patience, and did long To vex him. Duk. Did you so? Wife And for that purpose, Had warrant from your Grace, to cary him To Bethlem Monastery, whence they will not free him, Without your Graces hand that sent him in. Duke You haue longd fayre; tis you are mad I feare, Its fit to fetch him thence, and keepe you there: If he be mad why would you haue him forth? Geo. And please your grace, hees not starke mad, but onely talkes like a young Gentleman, somewhat phantastically, thats all: theres a thousand about your court, citty and countrie madder then he. Duk. Prouide a warrant, you shall haue our hand. Geo. Heres a warrant ready drawne my Lord. Cast. Get pen &amp; Inck get pen &amp; inck: Enter Castruchio. Cast. Where is my Lord the Duke? Duke How now? more mad men. Cast. I haue strange newes my Lord. Duk. Of Infælice, and a mariage. Du. Ha! where? with whom. Cast. Hipolito. Geo. Here my Lord. Du.

He that can make any man dead, the Doctor: but my Lord, hees as full of life as wilde-fire, and as quick: Hipolito, the Doctor, and one more rid hence this euening; the Inne at which they light is Bethlem Monastarie: Infæliche comes from Bergamo, and meetes them there: Hipolito is mad, for he meanes this day to be maryed, the after-noone is the houre, and Frier Anselmo is the knitter. Du. From Bergamo? ist possible? it cannot be, It cannot be. Cast. I will not sweare my Lord, But this intelligence I tooke from one, Whose braines workes in the plot. Du. Whats he? Cast. Mathæo. Flu. Mathæo knowes all. Pio. Hees Hipolitoes bosome. Duke How farre stands Bethlem hence? Omn. Six or seauen miles. Duke Ist euen so, not maried till the afternoone you say? Stay, stay, lets worke out some preuention: how: This is most strange, can none but mad-men serue To dresse their wedding dinner? All of you, Get presently to horse; disguise your selues Like Countrie-Gentlemen, Or riding citizens, or so: and take Each man a seuerall path, but let vs meete, At Bethlem Monasterie, some space of time Being spent betweene the arriuall each of other, As if we came to see the Lunaticks. To horse, away, be secret on your liues, Loue must be punisht that vniustly thriues. Exeunt. Flu. Be secret on your liues! Castruchio Y'are but a scuruy Spaniell; honest Lord, Good Lady: Zounds their loue is iust, tis good, And Ile preuent you, tho I swim in bloud. Exit. Enter Frier Anselmo, Hipolito, Mathæo, Infæliche. Hip. Nay, nay, resolue good father, or deny. Ans. You presse me to an act, both full of danger, And full of happinesse, for I behold. Your fathers frownes, his threats, nay perhaps death, To him that dare doe this, yet noble Lord, Such comfortable beames breake through these clowdes, By this blest mariage, that your honord word Being pawnd in my defence) I will tie fast, The holy wedding Knot. Hip. Tush feare not the Duke. Ans. O sonne, wisely to feare: Is to be free from feare. Hip. You haue our words, and you shall haue our liues, To guard you safe from all ensuing danger. Ma. I, I, chop em vp and away. Ans. Stay, when ist fit for me, safest for you, To entertaine this busines. Hip. Not till the euening. Ans. Be 't so, there is a chappell stands hard by, Vpon the West end of the Abbey wall, Thether conuay your selues, and when the sunne Hath turnd his back vpon this vpper world, Ile mary you, that done, no thundring voice, Can breake the sacred bond, yet Lady here you are most safe. Infæ. Father your lou's most deere. Mat. I well said locke vs into some little roome by our selues that we may be mad for an houre or two. Hip. O good Mathæo no, lets make no noise. Mat. How! no noise! do you know where you are: sfoot amonst all the mad-caps in Millan: so that to throw the house out at window will be the better, &amp; no man will suspect that we lurke here to steale mutton: the more sober we are, the more scuruy tis. And tho the Frier tell vs, that heere we are safest, i'me not of his minde, for if those lay here that had lost there mony, none would euer looke after them, but heare are none but those that haue lost their wits, o that if hue and cry be made, hether theile come, and my reason is, because none goes to be married till he be starke mad. Hip. Muffle your selues yonders Fluello. Enter Fluello. Ma. Zounds! Flu. O my Lord these cloakes are not for this raine, the tempest is too great: I come sweating to tell you of it, that you may get out of it. Mat. Why whats the matter. Flu. Whats the matter! you haue matterd it faire: the Duk's at hand. Onm. The Duke? Flu. The very Duke. Hip. Then all our plots are turnd vpon our heads; and we are blown vp with our own vnderminings. Sfoot how comes he, what villaine durst betray our being here. Flu. Castruchio, Castruchio tolde the Duke, and Mathæo here told Castrucio. Hip. Would you betray me to Chastruchio, Ma. Sfoot he dambd himselfe to the pit of hell if he spake ont agen. Hip. So did you sweare to me, so were you dambd. Mat. Pox on em, &amp; there be no faith in men, if a man shall not beleeue oathes: he tooke bread and salt by this light, that he would neuer open his lips. Hip. Oh God, oh God. Ans. Sonne be not desperate haue patience, you shal trip your enemy downe, by his owne slights, how far is the Duke h?ce. Flu. Hees but new set out: Castruchio, Pioratto and Sinezi come along with him: you haue time enough yet to preuent them if you haue but courage. Ans. You shall steale secretly into the Chappell, And presently be maried; if the duke Abide here still, spite of ten thousand eyes, You shall scape hence like Friers. Hip. O blest disguisde: O happy man. Ans. Talke not of happinesse till your closde hand, Haue her bitn' forhead, like the lock of time, Bye nor too slow, nor hasty, now you clime, Vp to the towre of blisse, onely be wary And patient, thats all, if you like my plot Build and dispatch, if not farewell, then not. Hip. O Yes, we doe applaud it, weele dispute, No longer, but will hence and execute. Fluello youle stay here, let vs be gon, The ground that fraighted louers tread vpon, Is stuke with thornes. Ans. Come then, away: tis meete, To escape those thornes, to put on winged feete. Exeunt. Mat. No words I pray Fluello, for it stands vs vpon. Flu. Oh sir, let that be your lesson. Alas poore louers, on what hopes and feares, Men tosse themselues for women, when shees got The best has in her that which pleaseth not.

What! met vpon the very point of time, Is this the place. Pio. This is the place my Lord. Duke Dreame you on Lordshps! come no more Lordes: pray You haue not seene these louers yet. Omn. Not yet. Duk. Castruchio art thou sure this wedding feate, Is not till afternoone? Castr. So tis giuen out my Lord. Duk. Nay, nay, tis like, theeues must obserue their houres, Louers watch minuts like Astronomers, How shall the Interim houres by vs be spent, Flu. Lets all goe see the madmen. Omn. Mas content. Enter Towne like a sweeper. Duk. Oh here comes one, question him, question him. Flu. How now honest fellow dost thou belong to the house. Tow. yes forsooth, I am one of the implements; I swepe the madmens roomes, and fetch straw for em, and buy chaines to tie em, and rods to whip em, I was a mad wag my selfe here once, but I thanke father Anselm he lasht me into my right minde agen. Duk. Anselmo is the Frier must marry them, Question where he is. Cast. And where is father Anselmo now? Tom. Mary hees gon but eene now. Duk. I, well done, tell me, whether is he gone? Tow. Why to God a mighty. Flu. Ha, ha, this fellow is a foole, talkes idlelie. Pio. Sirra are all the mad folkes in Millan brought hither? Tow. How all, theres a wise question indeede: why if al the mad folkes in Millan should come hither, there would not be left ten men in the Citty. Duk. Few gentlemen or Courtiers here, ha. Tow. Oh yes? abundance, aboundance, lands no sooner fall into their hands, but straight they runne out a their wits: Citiz?s sons &amp; heires are free of the house by their fathers copy: Farmers sons come hither like geese (in flocks) &amp; when they ha sould all their corne fields, here they sit &amp; picke the straws. Sin. Me thinks you should haue women here aswel as men. Tow. Oh, I: a plague on em, theres no ho with them, they are madder then march haires. Flu. Are there no lawyers here amongst you? Tow. Oh no, not one: neuer any lawyer, we dare not let a lawyer come in, for heele make em mad faster than we can recouer em. Du. And how long ister'e you recouer any of these. Tow. Why according to the quantitie of the Moone thats got into em, an Aldermans sonne will be mad a great while a very great while, especially if his friends left him well, a whore will hardly come to her wits agen: a puritane ther's no hope of him, vnlesse he may pull downe the steeple and hang himselfe it'h bell-ropes. Flu. I perceiue all sorts of fish come to your net. Tow. Yes in truth, we haue blockes for all heads, we haue good store of wilde oates here: for the Courtier is mad at the Citizen, the Cittizen is madde at the Country men, the shoomaker is mad at the cobler, the cobler at the carman, the punke is mad that the Marchants wife is no whore, the Marchants wife is mad that the puncke is so common a whore: gods so, heres father Anselmo. pray say nothing that I tel tales out of the schoole. Exit. Omn. God blesse you father. Enter Anselmo. Ans. Thanke you gentlemen. Cast. Pray may we see some of those wretched Soules, That here are in your keeping? Ans. Yes: you shall, But gentlemen I must disarme you then, There are of mad men, as there are of tame, All humourd not alike: we haue here some, So apish and phantastike, play with a fether, And tho twould greeue a soule, to see Gods image, So blemisht and defac'd, yet do they act Such anticke and such pretty lunacies, That spite of sorrow they will make you smile: Others agen we haue like hungry Lions, Fierce as wilde Buls, vntameable as flies, And these haue oftentimes from strangers sides Snatcht rapiers suddenly, and done much harme, Whom if youle see, you must be weaponlesse. Omn. With all our harts. Ans. Here: take these weapons in, Stand of a little pray, so, so, tis well: Ile shew you here a man that was sometimes, A very graue and wealthy Cittizen, Has serud a prentiship to this misfortune, Bin here seuen yeares, and dwelt in Bergamo. Duke How fell he from his wits? Ans. By losse at Sea: Ile stand aside, question him you alone, For if he spy me, heele not speake a word, Vnlesse hees throughly vext. Discouers an old man, wrapt in a Net. Flu. Alas poore soule. Cast. A very old man. Duk. God speed father. 1. Mad. God speed the plough: thou shalt not speed me. Pio. We see you old man, for all you daunce in a net. 1. Mad. True, but thou wilt daunce in a halter, &amp; I shal not see thee. Ans. O, doe not vex him pray. Cast. Are you a Fisherman father? 1. Mad. No, i'me neither fish nor flesh. Flu. What do you with that net then? 1. Mad. Doest not see foole! theres a fresh Salmon in't: if you step one foot furder, youle be ouer shoes, for you see ime ouerhead &amp; ear in the salt-water: &amp; if you fal into this whirlpoole where I am, y'are drownd: y'are a drownd rat.—I am fishing here for fiue ships, but I cannot haue a good draught, for my net breakes still, and breakes, but Ile breake some of your necks &amp; I catch you in my clutches. Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay—wheres the wind, wheres the wind, wheres the winde: wheres the winde: out you guls, you goose-caps, you gudgeon eaters! do you looke for the wind in the heauens? ha ha ha ha, no no, looke there, looke there, looke there, the winde is alwayes at that doore: hearke how it blowes, pooff pooff, pooff. Omn. Ha ha ha. 1. Mad. Do you laugh at Gods creatures? do you mock old age you roagues? is this gray beard and head counterfet, that you cry ha ha ha?—Sirra, art not thou my eldest sonne? Pior. Yes indeed father. 1. Mad. Then th'art a foole, for my eldest sonne had a polt foote, crooked legs, a vergis face, &amp; a peare-coullourd beard; I made him a scholler, and he made himselfe a foole.—Sirra! thou there? hould out thy hand. Du. My hand, wel, here tis. 1. Mad. Looke, looke, looke, looke: has he not long nailes, and short haire? Flu. Yes monstrous short haire, and abhominable long nailes. 1. Ma. Ten-peny nailes are they not? Flu. Yes ten peny nailes. 1. Mad. Such nailes had my second boy: kneele downe thou varlet, and aske thy father blessing. Such nailes had my midlemost sonne and I made him a Promoter: &amp; he scrapt, &amp; scrapt, &amp; scrapt, till he got the diuell and all: but he scrapt thus and thus, &amp; thus, and it went vnder his legs, till at length a company of Kites taking him for carion, swept vp all, all, all all, all, all, all.—If you loue your liues, looke to your selues, see, see, see, see, the Turkes gallies are fighting with my ships, Bownce goes the guns—oooh! cry the men: romble romble goe the waters—Alas! there! tis sunke—tis sunck: I am vndon, I am vndon, you are the dambd Pirates haue vndone me,—you are bith Lord, you are, you are, stop em, you are. Ans. Why how now Syrra, must I fall to tame you? 1. Mad. Tame me? no: ile be madder than a roasted Cat: see, see I am burnt with g?powder, these are our close fights. Ans. Ile whip you, if you grow vnruly thus. 1. Mad. Whip me? out you toad: whip me? what iustice is this, to whip me because Ime a begger?—Alas? I am a poore man: a very poore man: I am starud, and haue had no meate by this light, euer since the great floud, I am a poore man. Ans. Well, well, be quiet and you shall haue meate. 1. Mad. I, I, pray do, for looke you, here be my guts: these are my ribs,—you may looke through my ribs,—see how my guts come out—these are my red guttes, my very guts, oh, oh! Ansel. Take him in there. Omn. A very pitious sight. Cast. Father I see you haue a busie charge. Ans. They must be vsde like children, pleasd with toyes, And anon whipt for their vnrulinesse: Ile shew you now a paire quite different From him thats gon; he was all words: and these Vnlesse you vrge em, seldome spend their speech, But saue their tongues-la you-this hithermost Fell from the happy quietnesse of mind, About a maiden that he loude, and dyed: He followed her to church, being full of teares, And as her body went into the ground, He fell starke mad.

Why swels your spleene so hie? against what bosome, Would you your weapons draw? hers! tis your daughters: Mine! tis your sonnes. Duk. Sonne? Mat. Sonne, by yonder Sunne. Hip. You cannot shed blould here, but tis your owne, To spill your owne bloud were damnation, Lay smooth that wrinckled brow, and I will throw My selfe beneath your feete, Let it be rugged still and flinted o're, What can come forth but sparkles, that will burne, Your selfe and vs? Shees mine; my claymes most good, Shees mine by marriage, tho shees yours by bloud. I haue a hand deare Lord, deepe in this act, For I foresaw this storme, yet willingly Put fourth to meete it? Oft haue I seene a father Washing the wounds of his deare sonne in teares, A sonne to curse the sword that strucke his father, Both slaine ith quarrell of your families, Those scars are now tane off: And I beseech you, To seale our pardon, all was to this end To turne the ancient hates of your two houses To fresh greene friendship, that your Loues might looke: Like the springs forehead, comfortably sweete, And your vext soules in peacefull vnion meete, Their bloud will now be yours, yours will be theirs, And happinesse shall crowne your siluer haires. Flu. You see my Lord theres now no remedy. Omn. Beseech your Lordship. Duk. You beseech faire, you haue me in place fit To bridle me, rise Frier you may be glad You can make madmen tame, and tame men mad, Since fate hath conquered, I must rest content, To striue now would but ad new punishment: I yeeld vnto your happinesse, be blest, Our families shall henceforth breath in rest. Omn. O happy change. Duk. Yours now is my consent, I throw vpon your ioyes my full consent. Bell. Am not I a good girle, for finding the Frier in the wel? gods so you are a braue man: will not you buy me some Suger plums because I am so good a fortune teller. Duk. Would thou hadst wit thou pretty soule to aske, As I haue will to giue. Bell. Pretty soule, a prety soule is better than a prety body: do not you know my prety soule? I know you: Is not your name Mathæo. Mat. Yes lamb. Bell. Baa, lamb! there you lie for I am murton; looke fine man, he was mad for me once, and I was mad for him once, and he was madde for her once, and were you neuer mad? yes I warrant, I had a fine iewell once, a very fine iewell and that naughty man stoale it away from me, a very fine iewell. Duk. What iewell pretty maide. Bell. Maide nay thats a lie, O twas a very rich iewell, calde a Maidenhead, and had not you it leerer. Mat. Out you mad Asse away. Duk.

How, marry her my Lord? sfoot marry a mad-woman: let a man get the tamest wife he can come by, sheele be mad enough afterward, doe what he can. Duk.

Well then, when her wits stand in their right place, Bell. I thanke your grace, Mathæo thou art mine, I am not mad, but put on this disguise, Onely for you my Lord, for you can tell Much wonder of me, but you are gon: farewell. Mathæo thou didst first turne my soule black, Now make it white agen I doe protest, Ime pure as fire now, chaste as Cynthias brest. Hip. I durst be sworne Mathæo she's indeed. Mat. Cony-catcht, guld, must I saile in your flie-boate, Because I helpt to reare your maine-mast first: Plague found you fort, tis well. The Cuckolds stampe goes currant in all Nations, Some men haue hornes giuen them at their creations, If I be one of those, why so: its better To take a common wench, and make her good, Than one that simpers and at first, will scarse Be tempted forth ouer the threshold dore, Yet in one sennight, zounds, turnes arrant whore, Come wench, thou shalt be mine, giue me thy gols, Weele talke of legges here after: see my Lord, God giue vs ioy. Omn. God giue you ioy. Enter Candidoes wife and George. Geo. Come mistris we are in Bedlam now, mas and see, we come in pudding-time, for heres the Duke. Wif. My husband good my Lord. Duk. Haue I thy husband? Cast. Its Candido my Lord, he's here among the lunaticks: father Anselmo, pray fetch him forth: this mad-woman is his wife, and tho shee were not with child, yet did she long most spitefully to haue her husband mad, and because shee would be sure, he should turne Iew, she placde him here in Bethlem, youder he comes. Enter Candido with Anselmo. Duke Come hither Signior—Are you mad. Cand. You are not mad. Duke Why I know that. Cand. Then may you know, I am not mad, that know You are not mad, and that you are the duke: None is mad here but one—How do you wife: What do you long for now?—pardon my Lord, Shee had lost her childes nose els: I did cut out Penniworths of Lawne, the Lawne was yet mine owne: A carpet was yet my gowne, yet twas mine owne, I wore my mans coate, yet the cloath mine owne, Had a crackt crowne, the crowne was yet mine owne, She sayes for this Ime mad, were her words true, I should be mad indeed—ô foolish skill, Is patience madnesse? Ile be a mad-man still. Wife Forgiue me, and ile vex your spirit no more. Duk. Come, come, weele haue you friends, ioyne hearts, ioyne hands. Cand. See my Lord, we are euen, Nay rise, for ill-deeds kneele vnto none but heauen. Duk. Signior, me thinkes, patience has laid on you Such heauy waight, that you should loath it. Cand. Loath it. Duk. For he whose brest is tender bloud so coole, That no wrongs heate it, is a patient foole, What comfort do you finde in being so calme. Cand. That which greene wounds receiue fr? soueraigne balme, Patience my Lord; why tis the soule of peace: Of all the vertues tis neerst kin to heauen. It makes men looke like Gods; the best of men That ere wore earth about him, was a sufferer, A soft, meeke, patient, humble, tranquill spirit, The first true Gentleman that euer breathd; The stock of Patience then cannot be poore, All it desires, it has; what Monarch more? It is the greatest enemy to law That can be, for it doth embrace all wrongs, And so chaines vp, lawyers and womens tongues. Tis the perpetuall prisoners liberty: His walkes and Orchards: 'tis the bond slaues freedome, And makes him seeme prowd of each yron chaine. As tho he wore it more for state then paine: It is the beggers Musick, and thus sings, Although their bodies beg, their soules are kings: O my dread liege! It is the sap of blisse, Reares vs aloft; makes men and Angels kisse, And (last of all) to end a houshould strife, It is the hunny gainst a waspish wife. Duke Thou giu'st it liuely coulours: who dare say he's mad, whose words march in so good aray? Twere sinne all women should such husbands haue. For euery man must then be his wiues slaue. Come therefore you shall teach our court to shine, So calme a spirit is worth a golden Mine, Wiues (with meeke husbands) that to vex them long, In Bedlam must they dwell, els dwell they wrong. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
