      <field name="fulltext">Carpere vel noli nostra vel ede tua. Mart. Epig.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Enter Time Time that is past, the Muses now recalls, forcing my fleeting presence to retire, and pitch my feet upon the English shore, I had almost drown'd in black oblivion, an honour'd History of an English Knight, as Famous once for deeds of Chivalry, as any of the Worthies of the world: Renowned Sir Guy of Warwick whose great Name, makes England famous in all after times, for nursing up so brave a Martiallist. Time now renues his fortunes to the world and layes them open to your Gentle Views; think then with apprehensive eyes you see this war like Lord boldly attempt to fight, with that fell savage Bore of Calledon that spoiles the fields and murders passengers, him hath his sword subdu'd; and now again, be combates with that huge and monstrous beast, call'd the wild Cow of Dunsmore Heath; all for the love of Phillis he performs, for Phillis love, old Rohons only Child, what will not Guy of Warwick dare to do? and having done those things that she enjoyn'd, he reaps the harvest of her happy love, and at the length enjoyes her for his wife. To grace this bridal feast, imagine then, King Athelstone hath left fair Winchester and here in Warwick Castle keeps his Court. VVhat follows now of Guy and his fair Deeds, sit and behold, the story now proceeds. Exit Time. Enter King Athelstone, Guy, Phillis, Rohon, Herod, with others. King. Brave Guy of Warwick, honourable Earl. thus long in love and favour to thy self King Athelstone hath left fair Winchester, to frolick here with thee and thy fair Bride; Phillis the comfort of old Rohons Age thus long to you we have been troublesome, and used your Parkes and Pastures as our own; but now wee'l leave these parts of Warwickshire and back again return to Winchester. Guy. These Kingly favours that your grace hath shown, in honouring me a worthlesse Subject thus, hath plum'd my thoughts with Eagle-flighted wings, and beares my mounting minde as high as Heaven, till I have done some deeds of Chivalry; Worthy the love of your Dread Maiesty: Guy. Which il'e perform with treble diligence, and at your yearly Feast of Pentecost will Guy of Warwick send a hundred Knights, suddue'd and conquer'd by these Warlike Armes, to do their Homage to King Athelstone, lowly upon their knees at Winchester. King. We thank thee Guy, but will not have it so, live with thy love, thy sword hath won thee Fame, and all the world doth speak of Warwicks Name. Herod. The conquests that by thee hath been Atchiev'd, makes men amaz'd, and warlike Knights affraid to come in danger of thy Conquering Sword. Lord. Thy manly deeds are Graven in each mans breast, and thy large fame is spread from East to West. Rohon. Live then in peace, my fair high-hearted Sonne, since all men muse, to think what thou hast done, the Calledonian savage Bore is dead, and by thy hand the wild Cow slaughtred, that kept such Revels upon Dunsmore Heath; and many adventures hast thou past beside to make my Daughter Phillis thy fair Bride: she now is thine, and all that I possesse, is Guy of Warwicks so hee'l stay with us. Phillis. Intends my honoured Lord to leave us then, speak gentle love, my heart is full of fear; O seek not danger, that is every where. King. Content thee Phillis for he shall not go, thy love intreats but we command him so, And now Earl Rohon, reach the King thy hand; Old man we thank thee and we take our leave; Farewell Sir Guy, fair Phillis now adieu, all earthly comfort still attend on you. Exit King. Guy. Bright Angels still protect your Majesty, Father conduct the King a little on his way, Exit Rohon and Herod. Sir Herod attend them, Phillis here, and I, must yet confer, wee'l follow presently. Phillis. What means my honour'd Lord to stay behind, when every one attends his Soveraign; why dost thou look so sad and stand so mute? all looking downwards with thy care-craz'd head: speak gentle love, if griefe thy mind oppresse, Phillis will never leave thee comfortlesse. Guy. Ah Phillis! Phillis. Sweet: what hath Phillis done that thy great heart should grieve to think upon? Guy. Nothing, O nothing, and I now to thee, neither the fear of death, the losse of friends, nor any thing this mortal life can yield, doth trouble me or once molest my mind. Phill. What then disturbs thy high heroick Thoughts? Guy. That I must leave my Phiilis whom I love; O be not sad dear soul, but hear me speak; for what I say must stand irrevocable. Seven years to win thy love this Sword of mine, hath beat down Monsters, and subdued strong Knights; seven years to win thy love this breast of mine, hath bin oppos'd even against the face of death: But for my God who gave me power and strength to doe these wonders in the sight of man, hath Guy of Warwicke yet no service done, the thought of which torments my inward soul; and breaks my heart untill I have redeem'd my great neglect of service to my God; For which to him alone I have made a Vow, never to lie by my fair Phillis side, to eat, to drink, nor rest long in one place, till I have seen my Saviours Sepulchre, within the Walls of fair Jerusalem; and with my Sword for my Redeemers sake, beat back those misbelieving Saracens, that seek the Ruine of that holy place, making them leave deluding Mahomet, and trust upon the blessed Name of Christ. All this hath Warwicke sworn to undertake, or loose his Life for his Redeemers sake. Phill. Sweet Lord! Guy. O do not bid me stay, and ask me what thou wilt, I must away! Phill. See the rich burthen of my youthful womb, the hopeful issue of thy happy love; let that yet move thee, dear Lord do not go, lest both of us do pine with grief and woe. Guy. Weep not sweet love; for tears will not avail; but when the time comes thou art brought on bed, and of thy child art safe delivered: Give it to Herod if it be a a son, with it deliver him this Ring of Gold; tell him that I intreat him from my heart that he will see my Infant well brought up; bid him be kind to him, as I have been, in all Adventures dangerous to him. Now give me my Palmers Gown, my Hat and Staff, these must I wear, fly hence all worldly pomp; thus for my Saviour and Redeemer's sake these blessed Weeds of Pilgrimage I take. Phill. My hearts so sad I know not what to say, God grant thy Grave be not that Gown of gray; My much misdoubting heart sayes I shall see, my high loved Lord laid low in misery. Guy. Do not presage, dear love, but here me speak, I charge thee on that love thou bearst to me, never to reveal to Father, Friend, no nor the King himself, what I intend nor whither I am gone; until a month be past and I hence free; for pursuit of my Friends will follow me. Do this and Phillis love will brightly shine, and Guy return with joy from Palestine. Phillis. I must, I will even do what you please, your will shall be fulfilled yet ere you go; this pledge of my true love I will bestow; upon thy Hand I put my marriage Ring, If ere I see the same and thou not by, Phillis will grieving weep, and weeping die. Guy. I take thy pledge of love, and in exchange, I give this true loves kisse, and here I Vow, nothing but death shall make me leave this Ring. Time calls me hence, fair Phillis now farewell, with thee let all Heavens joys for ever dwell. Exeunt. Enter Old Philip Sparrow, &amp; his son the Clown. Old. Dost thou hear me soon, zoon. Clow. Never talk Father, never talk; for Youth will have his swindge, if it be in a Halter; and I being a young Man and a Scholar, will go travel to try the fruits of my Learning. Old. But whither wilt thou go soon ha? Clow. Faith Father, Romo Romulus, even to Rome, Morter morteribus, with a Morter on my Head. But Father Ile come upon ye with a Verse, Prapria que maribones tribiunter masculæ dogstones. Old. Whats that zoon ha? Clow. That is, you must give me Forty pounds, and I must go seek my fortune. Old. Nay chil hold thee vorty of my teeth on that, the whorson knave, and he'd tarry at home he might be Clark of our Parish, so he might; he has his writing and reading Tongue, as perfect as eating porredge, so he has; and sides all that, he spowts Latin as vast as a Mill grinds fault; but che know the cause why thoudst so vain be jogging? Clow. Why Father? Old. Nay chill tell thee with a witnesse, 'tis comported all about our Parish that thou hast got our Neighbour Sparlings Daughter with Barne. Clow. How comes the old Fox to know this trow; well I must set a good face on the matter or alls mar'd. Who I get her with Child? Father, why I take to witnesse the back-side of our Barn-door, I never kist her but twice in all my life. Old. That thou shalt see, come hither Parnell. Enter Parnell. Par. O Mr. Sparrow I little thought you would have us'd me thus! Clow. Why Parnell how have I us'd you? If there be ever a one in the Parish can use you better, let him take you and the Child too for me. Par. But Mr. Sparrow you are not so good as your promise. Clow. Nay Parnell never talk of that; for I have been better to you then my promise. Old. How Knave, hast thou been better to her then thy promise, ha? Clow. Why Father if you'l not bite off my Nose, Ile tell ye, I promised her to go home and eat a sowre Milk Posset; and if I have got her with child, 'tis more then my promise, and she's beholding to me for my labour. Old. I sirrah, but you must marry her and make her amends. Clow. How like an old fool you talk Father, why, she had more need make me amends; for I have made her look pritty and plump, and she has made me look like a shotten Herring. But Father take your blessing from me, for I must needs be walking. Hony sops queen Maries pence, Tears parts at going hence, Ego volo Domine tu, Sparrow will come with joy to you. Old. Gods malediction go with thee good soon, Ah wees me, wees me. Par. Farewel good Mr. Sparrow. Exeunt Old Man &amp; Parnel. Clow. Nay do not cry good Father, do not weep sweet Parnel, but even farewel and be hang'd, thats twice God bo'ye; I made as though I had been sorry, but I could not weep and if I should ha been hang'd; but now will I go serve the bravest Man in all the world, his Name is Sir Guy of Warwick; they say he's going to Jerusalem and Jerico; but if he goes to the Divel I'le go with him, that's flat; and if Parnel be brought to bed before I come again, some honest Fellow do so much as pay for the Nursing of the Child, and Ile do as much for him another time. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Time. Devotion and Divine Atchievments cause Great Guy of Warwick to neglect all Lawes, Of Nuptial League, he leaves his pregnant VVife, Countrey and Kindred for a holy Life, But in his progresse, makes himself a prize To multitudes of matchlesse miseries; By which it may be justly understood, He is not truly great, that is not good: In Holy Lands abroad his spirits roame And not in Deanes and Chapters lands at home, His sacred fury menaceth that Nation, VVhich hath Indea under Sequestration: He doth not strike at Surplices and Tippits, (To bring an Oleo in of Sects in Sippits) But deales his warlike and dead-doing blowes, Against his Saviours and his Soveraigns foes; That Coat of Armour fears no change of weather, Where sanctity and souldier go together: So doth our Champion march up to the fight, Sit, silent, pray, Time will bring all to light. Exit. Enter Guy and Sparrow. Guy. What Sirrah Sparrow? Spar. Anon, anon Sir. Guy. What are you turn'd Tapffer since you came out of England? Spar. Tapster quotha I shall never be so good a man while I live; for I had rather see a Tapster then a King: I like your long Journeys at Sea wel but for one thing. Guy. What's that I pray? Spar. O Master heres no Alehouses by the way, a man cannot get a Can of Beer for any Money; but Master why did you give that great Castle you got from the Gyant to that pueling harlotry in the silk Gown? Guy. Why Sir she was a Lady of great birth. Spar. A Ladle of great birch, why and she had been a ladle of holly; I would not have given't her I trow, you had bin better a given it me by half. Guy. What wouldest thou have done with it? Spar. I would have wrapt it in a Letter and sent it into Warwickeshire for a token: but Master, good sweet Master lend me your Sword. Enter an Hermit. Guy. What wilt thou do with it? Spar. Here comes an Old man Ile kill him. Guy. Ye cowardly Rogue wilt thou kill a Hermit? Spar. An Emmot quotha, 'tis one of the fowlest great Emmots that ever I saw. Guy. God blesse thee Father and send thee happinesse on Earth and Heaven when thou diest. Spar. And the Gallowes when a dyes, what should he do with Heaven? Her. O what art thou that speakest of God or Heaven, full forty Winters have I lived here, and never heard the Name of God till now, but in my prayers and my orisons. Spar. A sawcy old Knave I perceive, he uses to eat Orrenges, Which very word makes me have an appetick as fierce as a Fidler at a Feast; it is a question of some difficulty, to resolve whether my Masters Spirit, or my Stomack be the greater; if he have the valour to knock down a Dun Cow, I have the Courage to Cut he rup, and the Confidence to Carbonado her quarters. Guy. Father into your private ears I dare, power out my spirit, my designments are for holy Actions, you may understand, my pilgrimage is to the holy Land, where my Redeemer's cause is trodden down, where he wore Thorns, Usurpers wear a Crown, I go to view the Monument and story Of him that was no lesse then Lord of Glory. Her. You answer punctually to what I ask, but son you undertake a tedious task, as intricate as dangerous, may I crave the name of him whose valour is so brave? Guy. Although I now shrowded in these Pilgrims weeds, (an holy habit fit for holy deeds) I am an Earle, men call me Guy of VVarwick. Her. In all the space betwixt Dover and Barwick, I have not known a man of clearer Fame, (whose actions add new glory to his Name) then he that owns that title, all that's good, attend your Spirit and preserve your blood. Spar. And Father Emmot did you never hear of the Famous actions and valorous Atchievments of one Squire Sparrow? Guy. Away you Hedg-bird. Spar. Phillip is his Name, A bird of Venus, and a Cock of the Game, who once being in Love with pritty Parnell, did crack her Nut, and thou maist pick the Kernell; she is a Peacock every man doth vayle his bonnet to her, when she shewes her tayle. Guy. Leave talking of your trundle Sirrah. Spar. VVhy so? my Mistris Parnell is as precious to me, as your Lady Phillis is to you, we have gotten them both with child; and all the difference is, that Phillis is your wedded VVife, and Parnell is my unmarried Mistris, and we must needs run up and down killing of Dun Cowes, Dragons, VVild-boars and Mastiff Dogs, when we have more work at home then we can well turn our hands to. Her. I like your high design, that for the truth, can in the dayes of dalliance and youth, prosecute piety, and attempt things that Consecrate the Crowns of greatest Kings. Guy. Father your benediction will add wings Guy kneeleth. to all my undertakings. Her. May the springs Of ever pregnant providence ne're be, shut to your wants, but flow fertyle and free, may you ne're feel necessities sharp rod, the blessed Guardians of the highest God, protect thy steps and keep thee far from ill; so farewell Son my prayers attend thee still. Spar. Nay but do you here Old Man, pray let you and I have a two or three cold words together? Have you ever a House here in these Woods? Her. No House but a poor Cottage, gentle friend. Spar. Unch, How say ye? you would fain curry favour with me, but 'twill not serve your turn: Have ye ever an Ambry in your Cottage, where a Man may find a good Bag-pudding, a piece of Beef, or a Platter of Bruis knockle deep in Fat; for I tell thee old fellow, I am sharp set, I have not eat a good Meal this Fortnight. Guy. Come hither Sirrah, can I no sooner come into a strangers Company, but you seek to disgrace me! Spar. Who I? why Master? you are mightily deceived in me, for I never use to say Grace before I see meat on the Table. Guy. Sirrah, I speak not of saying Grace but of Disgrace, therefore Sirrah go and tell him you want no meat. Spar. Shall I tell him so? Guy. I Sir. Spar. I shall tell him a monstrous lye then. Guy. You'l tell him so, quickly too if I intreat you. Spar. Yes i'le tell him because I dare do no otherwise; old man did I tell you I wanted meat? Her. I marry did you. Spar. Ye lye like an old Knave, yet if you have any Bread and Cheese about you, put a piece in my Cap. Guy. Sir leave your prating, Father fare you well. Her. More good attend thee then my tongue can tell. Exit Hermit. Guy. This is the stately Tower of Donather, where Huon of Burdeaux a couragious Knight slew Angolofar in a single Fight: go Sparrow, seek find me an entrance in, let me alone to cope, with those comes forth. Spar. Why Master have you no more wit but to send me, did not you hear that there keeps a monstrous Gyant in this Castle, that eateth a quarter of an Ox at a bit, his mouth's as wide as a barn door, his eyes as broad as two pewter platters, and besides all that, they say, he hath Four and twenty Men to throw Mustard in his Mouth; Now if I should come in the way, fall in the Mustard Fot, and be thrown into his mouth, you might go look for a man where you could get him. Guy. I but you being a Sparrow methinks should flye from them. Spar. O Master I must confesse I have been something loftily minded in my young dayes, but Parnell and the rest of the pritty Wenches in our Parish have so pluct my plumes, that I was never good mounter since ifaith. It Thunders and Lightens. Guy. Very well, then you'l not go? Spar. Go, yes i'le go that's flat. O Master! the Divel, the Divel, the Divel. Guy. Why? how now Sirrah, are you affraid? Spar. No, I scorne to be affraid, but good Master for Gods sake grant me one request, upon my knees I ask it. Guy. What's that Sir? Spar. Sweet hony Master go your self. Guy. I thank you Sir, but if you go not soon, my Sword shall bring you of a stomack to go. Spar. O Master, never talk of that; for I have a stomack like a Horse, but no heart in the world to go to such a break-fast, but yet I'le go what somere comes ont, though I run into a bush presently; I am in Master, I am in. It Thunders &amp; Lightens. Guy. It is no Gyant sure that keeps this place, but some Inchanter or dam'd Sorcerer. Hell-hound come forth, that I may cope with thee, I fear not all thy charming Sorceries; send forth no shadows to afright my soul, my Faith no Hell-born Fury can controul. Enter the Inchanter. Inchan. Let all my horrid Vapours cease their strength; Let the Air Freeze, the Earth be cold as Ice, whereon this during Knight dothset his Feet. For though Hells Force can no waies daunt his heart, he soon shall know my Force can tame his Pride. Guy. I cannot lift my Arms unto my Head, my Feet stick fast into the solid earth, and I shall never move my self from hence, damned inchanter, hellish sorcerer, whose black dam'd Art, hath wrought my lucklesse fall; O that thou durst let loose this damned spell, I soon would send thy fiend-like soul to Hell. Inchan. By all the burning brooks of Phlegiton, by Styx and Acheron I vow and swear ne're shalt thou go alive out of this place. Thus do I lay a charme upon thy head, a hell bred slumber close thy sences up; there groveling lye, and never more arise, Guy falls. a black inchanted charme close up thine eyes. Exit inchanten. Enter Oberon King of the Fairies. Obe. But I will break thy charming Sorceries, and he shall wake to be thy overthrow. You harmlesse spirits of the flowry Meades, Nymphes, Satyres, Fawnes, and all the Fairy train, that waits on Oberon the Fairy King, attend me quickly with your silver tunes; and in a circled Ring, lets compasse round, this sleeping Knight that lies upon the ground. Enter the Fairies with Musick, they Dance about him, Oberon strikes Guy with his Wand, he awakes and speakes. Guy. Where art thou Guy? what heavenly place is this? what ravishing sound of Musick fills mine ear? what blessed shadowes do appear to me, that am a woful wretched sinful man? O pardon me as I am faithful true, I never yet meant hurt to none of you. Obe. We know it well, arise fair Knight, stand up, Guy ariseth. thou wert inchanted by a hellish fiend, that doth inhabit in this hatefull Tower; he casts thee in a deadly charming sleep, and but by my means thou shouldest ne're have walkt, I am the Fairy King that keeps these Groves, for Huon of Burdeaux sake, thy Warlike friend, the dear loved Minion of the Fairy King, will I make Guy of Warwicks name be fear'd; for conquest of the Tower of Donather, here take this charming Wand, I give it thee, which is of such great vertue if it touch, all the Inchantments in this spacious world, they all shall be dissolv'd immediately. For proof whereof make tryal against this Tower, and in a moment it shall vanish hence. Guy. Great Fairy King, how am I bound to thee, that from these dangers hast delivered me, I'le touch this Tower, if that dissolve these charmes, Warwick is free from all inchanting harmes. It Thunders, Lightens. Enter Sparrow running. Spar. Fire, Fire, Fire. Guy. How now Sirrah, what's the news with you? Spar. Whoop Master are you alive still? nay, then I care not ifaith, but I have been peper'd since I went from you. Guy. How Sir I pray. Spar. When you sent me to seek an entrance into the Castle, I thinking it was good sleeping in a whole skin, ran and hid my self in a bush, I had not lain there long but it began to Thunder and Lighten monstrously, and presently the Bush flew a Fire about my Eares; that with your favour I came away in a stinking complexity; but Master what fine little hop, O my Thumbs have you got here. Guy. Sirrah take heed what you say for these are Fairies. Spar. Fairies quotha, I care not what they be, I'le have about with them for a bloody Nose; I have a better stomack to fight with one of them, then with the Gyant agreat deal; Unch ye whorson little pigpies, you i'le tickle ye ifaith. The Fairies fall about him, pulls him down, pinches him, he cries out. O Master help, help. Guy. How now Sirrah, what's the newes with you? Spar. I am kil'd master, I am kil'd. Guy. Kil'd knave, where art kil'd? Spar. In the Buttock, in the Buttock. Guy. VVell Sir, rise, or i'le rise ye. Spar. Rise quotha, yes, I'le rise, but I am sure I am dead; do you call these Fairies, a vengeance on them, they have tickled my Collefodiums ifaith; but master what is that same little gentlemans name? Guy. Sir his name is King Oberon. Spar. Little Gentleman is your name King Colbron? Obe. No Sir, my name is King Oberon. Spar. VVhy then good King Muttonbone learne your little Munkies to pair their Nayles with a pestilence; for my posteriors will feel the print of them this fortnight at the least. Obe. Sir hold your peace, and Guy give me thy hand, the way i'le shew thee to the holy land, where I will add such glory to thy name that all the world shall speak of Warwicks fame. The black Inchanter he is gone to Hell, in endlesse torments ever for to dwell, Nymphs, Satyres, Fawnes, and all the rest march on, before stout Guy, and youthful Oberon. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Enter Time. Thus swiftly runs the silent houres of Time, whilst wordly men secured by their wealth, think not on time nor on their soules fair health but those whose well adorned lymbes are made, of that pure mettal which shall never fade; those that have learned of Angells how to sing, and to the world all piety doth bring, and fills the world with learning and with art, to those doth Time her Golden gifts impart; you fair beholders of this honoured story, think now that Guy of Warwick he is gone, leaving these Fairies and King Oberon, and now to fair Jerusalem takes his way; where hearing of the Wars the Pagans make against that City and that holy Land, he now prepares himself by force of Armes, to save Judea from insuing harmes; long stories are not told in little time, much matter in small room we must combyne: wee'l curt all nothing, yet make something short, because we would shun tediousnesse of sport; if it be long, say length is all the fault, if it be lame, say old men needs must halt. Enter Sultan Shamurath, Soldan of Babylon, with Zorastes. Sult. Thus Sultan Shamurath, as Earthly God of Kings, have marcht along with all their VVarlike Troopes. Ten Thousand Gallies, ships and brigandines, lye dancing on the Adratique Sea, ready to be commanded when we please, to bear this Captive King of fair Jerusalem, to our Triumphant City Babylon; but say Zorastes, how shall we employ our VVarlike Forces 'gainst these Christians. Most dread and mighty Emperour of the East, whose puissant and warlike Force commands, even from the orient to the sonnes decline; suffer not thus these hated Christians to inmure themselves in walls of stone and brasse, whilst Sultan Shamurath with all his Lords attends a day of battle with their swords. Great King of Babell, now be rul'd by me, and let Zorastes counsel now prevail, I'le raise up heaps of damned spirits from hell, that shall make way unto my bold attempt. Legions of Divels attend my dreadful Charmes, ready to be commanded when I please; then mighty Soldan make no more delay, my art shall make the Conquerour this day. Sultan. Thankes stout Zorastes, great Magician thanks, but first lets summon them unto a parley perhaps they'l yield their City to our hands, knowing our force to be invincible, and they not able to withstand our power. Trumpet or Drum summon a parley there. A parley sounded, Enter the King of Jerusalem upon the walls. King. What craves Thasirian Emperour at our hands? Sultan. Homage and fealty as thy Soveraigne Lord, of all these spacious bounds of Christendome; know petty King of fair Jerusalem I am the mighty Sultan Shamurath that rules the tripple City Babylon, and all the Kingdomes of the Eastern world, only this little part of Asia, holds out against us and derides our faith scorning our Lawes of holy Mahomet, but by his blessed Alcaron I swear, I'le ne're depart, nor draw my Army hence, till in the Temples of Jerusalem, both Mahomet, Asteroth and Termagaunt, those holy Gods that Governs Babylon be set for you stout Christians to adore, which ye shall do, or all of you shall die, and basely at our foot like Vassals lie. King. Proud and Presumptuous Tyrant as thou art, we fear no bug-bear threats of Tyranny, nor all the multitudes thou canst command, we guard and keep the blessed Sepulchre, of our deare Saviour and Redeemer Christ, within the walls of fair Jerusalem, though on a suddain with your heathen Troops, you have begirt us with a fearful siege: yet know proud Syrian that fair Zions hill, King Solomon's Temple, and the marble Tomb, which we adore with awfull reverence, can raise a hundred thousand Christians and proudly beat you back to Babylon. Sultan. Thou will not then surrender us thy Town? King. Not whilst one man survives to lift a sword, attempt the worst you can, to save or kill, we are prepar'd even against the worst of ill. Exit King. Sult. Why then at all, march forward warlike Lords, wee'l parley now with Pole-axe, Bills and Swords, darraigne our battles, and begin the Fight, and Mahound still direct my course Aright. Exeunt Omnes. Enter Guy of Warwick Solus. Guy. Thus through the help of my dear Saviour Christ, whose out-strecht arm hath still preserved me, I am escap't from Sultan Shamurath, and all his Hoast of cursed Saracens; now I am come where I may fix mine eyes safely upon King David's City walls. Is this Judeas pride, fair Zions hill? Sanctum sanctorum and the house of Heaven, the place where my dear Saviour lost his Life? O how it grieves me to behold thy walls, hem'd in with Dogs and cursed Saracens, that seek to rob thee of thy beauty quite, and turn thy joyful day to mourning night. But heaven assisting me, I will prevent their damned purposes, and make them repent, their journey taken 'gainst Judeas good, or in that fair adventure spend my blood. Enter Sparrow crying. Spar. Tarry, tarry, tarry, hold, hold, hold. Guy. Why? how now sirrah, what's the news with you? Spar. O Master are you there? I have done such an exploit as you never heard of in your life. Guy. What's that Sir? Spar. Nay, I am sure it passes your Capacity, but I'le tell you though, for it was a valiant piece of service, when I saw you got in amongst the Pogons, I thought some body had hired you to break heads by the dozen, for you never hit any of them, but they shak't their heels as though they had the Palsey; I seeing you so hard at work thought it not best to trouble ye, but after the old manner ran and hid my self in a bush. Guy. O Cowardly slave! was this your Valiant piece of service? Spar. O Master you doe not hear half yet, I lay so long till you were gone, and looking out of the bush, I could see all the Pogons laid fast asleep; then went I sneaking and stole away their Snapsacks with all their Victuals, I got up to the top of a Hill, and eat it up every bit, when I had done, I began to hollow; the Pogans missing their provant, came running after me, but I made one pair of Leggs worth two pair of Hands, and out-run them all ifaith. Guy. I thought what hot service you doe alwaies, but peace, here comes the King of fair Jerusalem. Enter the King of Jerusalem. King. I am a wretched King, the more my wo, Kings are sometimes distrest, and I am so, but if thou be that warlike Conquerour, that through the Pagan hoast hath cut thy way, I do beseech thee even with woful tears, to save Judea Sion Palestine, from base attempt of heathen servitude. Spar. If it be? O scurvy, if it be! why I'le tell you Goodman King, twas I and my master tickled 'um ifaith. Guy. True Sir, you and your Master and I, pray what did you? Spar. Why Master? when you had kil'd them, I came and cut off their Heads. King. Where wert thou born? or whats thy Countries name, brave Christian Knight, may I be bold to ask? Guy. My Native Countrey is fair England cal'd, my name Sir Guy of Warwick hither come of holy zeal to see my Saviours Tomb, but seeing it hem'd round about with foes, I cut a passage with my Warlike sword, meaning to rescue it or lose my Life. King. Heaven prosper thy attempt, lead on Fair Knight, God and good Angels still protect our Right. Guy. God and Saint George in Warwicks quarrel Fight. Exit Omnes. Alarum, Enter Sultan, Zorastes from the Fight. Sultan. O speak Zorastes, what Divel or Man is that, which in his Fury confounds such heaps of men? Zorast. My Lord I cannot tell, but this I know, neither Turk nor Saracen can withstand his blow, our Souldiers fly like chaff before the Wind, and none can stand against his Conquering sword. Sultan. Canst thou not tell me what he is? nor by thy Magick charmes confound the slave? Zorast. I can do both as you shall streight behold; Bellemoth, Asteroth Ascend. Spirit. Quid me vis? Zorast. I charge thee tell me truly who it is, that in his rage confounds and spoiles our men. Spirit. 'Tis Guy of Warwick that is hither come, of holy zeal to see his Saviour Tomb. Zorast. But never shall he see that Marble Grave, go Bellemoth, and in a fierce flame, hoyse him aloft into the vacant Air, and throw him headlong into the Neighbouring Seas. Spirit. Abeo. Zorast. No, we fight my Lord, for victory is your's. Sultan. Why? then Zorastes once more to the Fight, and Mahomet direct my course Aright. Exeunt Omnes. Alarum Excursions. Enter Sultan and Zorastes flying, Guy and they Fight, Zorastes Escapeth, Guy taketh Sultan Prisoner. Then Enter the King of Jerusalem. King. Command these brawling Drums to cease their noise, whilst I salute our Warlike Conquerour, renown'd Sir Guy of Warwick, whose great name, extolls fair England with a glorious fame; sit in our Throne victorious Englishman, our Crown and Scepter shall be all as free, to Guy of Warwick as it is to me. Guy. Far be it from the thought of Englishman, to usurp the seat of fair Jerusalem; but for those favours you have grac't me with here I resigne unto your princely hands, Great Sultan Shamurath, King of Babylon. King. Victorious Knight, both in thy words and deeds, this proud presumptuous King of Babylon which thou surrend rest here as prisoner, I freely do deliver back to thee, to ransome or dispose as thou thinkst best. Sultan. Let me be ransom'd mighty Christian Knight, and I will back surrender to thy hands all those Townes and Castles I have won, Joppa, Samaria and Rich Nazareth, with fifty Thousand bars of silver plate, to ransome home great Sultan Shamurath. Guy. I scorn thy league and love, proud heathen King, I'le make thee now my Vassals underling. Sultan. Scornst thou to love the Monarch of the world? Guy. The Monarch of black Hell, should I not scorn, the love of Belzebub Leviathan, Sultan stamps. Nay Sir I'le make you tear your Mahomet, and stamp and stare. Enter Sparrow with a Pagan in a Halter. Spar. I and swear too ifaith afore I have done with him; O Master you think I can do nothing, I have catcht a Pogon. Guy. How sir I pray? Spar. Why Master after the valliantest manner that could be; for I found him asleep, and having a Halter in my pocket, put it about his Neck instead of a falling band. Guy. But what will you do with him now? Spar. Marry Master, first and come fordermost, I'le hang him two houres by the Clock, then I'le cut off his head because he shall not call me knave for my labour; and when I have done so, I'le let him go his way, nay ye whorson Pogon I'le tickle ye that's The Pogan takes the Halter from his own Neck, and put's it about Sparrows neck, and runs away. flat; O Master the Pogon has given me two slips for a Tester, but I'le after him, if I catch him again, I'le give him a Cawd east in's Chaps, that's two turns and a wry mouth, and then he may drink to his friends all the day after. Exit Sparrow. Guy. Since that your Majesty hath back delivered, this Sultan Shamurath into my hands, know the ransome I will set on him, shall please our God and all good Christians. O blessed Emperour think upon the Crosse, which is the true badg of our sweet Saviour Christ by whose great help we have got Victory. Then to enlarge the Fame of Christendome, and our great makers ever glorious name, Thou Sultan Shamurath with all thy Hoast, shall leave your faith and become Christians; do this, from any ransome thou art free, and all thy people set at liberty. Sult. We yield consent victorious Conqueror, the God you serve is great Omnipotent, ruling the day of battle as he please, making one hundred kill ten thousand men, such were the odds of our Battallions; therefore for Guy of Warwicks sake, wee'l trust in Christ, and Mahound clean forsake. King. Then fit we honour'd to the Marble Tomb, where you shall have received your Christendome, you and your Lords shall take a Solemne Oath, that all your Empery shall do the like; come on brave Guy, for by thy hand is done, this Everlasting fame to Christendome. Exeunt King and Sultan. Guy. Go on great Kings, I'le follow presently, and now since all those wars are at an end, and that my heavenly Maker hath vouchsaft to give me victory against his foes, in lowly Pilgrimage I vow to come, and visit my dear Saviours blessed Tomb; there for an everlasting memory, I'le offer up my sword and furniture, and here I make a vow in sight of Heaven, that henceforth i'le never bear Armes again, but spend the residue of my sinful Life, in zealous Prayers and repentant Tears, for all the follies of my wretchlesse youth. Now glorious God with thy Auspicious eye, smile on this happy work that's thus began, to enlarge the fame of blessed Christendome. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter Time. Thus Time that in his ceaslesse motion, controuls the hearts of Kings and Emperours, hath now converted Sultan Shamurath to tread the path of perfect Christendome; and now with Bishops, Priests and Patriarks, they are returned back to Babylon, to Christen all that Heathen Nation; think this is done, and now again suppose, that Guy of Warwick after he had seen his Saviours Tomb, and there had offered up as Monuments of lasting Memory; his sword, his shield, and Warlike Furniture, he there vow'd never to bear Armes again, and now towards England is returning back. Imagine that Sir Raynborn his fair son, is grown a man, and hearing of the deeds of his great Father, leaveth all his Friends to seek him out in Forrain Nations. Think this is done, and now again suppose that Guy of Warwick now is waxen old, and at the length of many a weary step, he comes to England, where perforce alas he must oppose, his weak decayed limbs against the vigor of a Gyants strength; for now the Danes in absence of this Lord, have set their feet so far on Englands ground, that they had almost conquered all the Land, and to a forced Parley drives the King; how they conclude, and by what means agree, Time shall make known to you immediately. Exit Time. Enter Swanus King of Denmark, with him Colbron. Then Athelstone King of England, with him Herod. Athelstone. Swanus of Denmark, since to this Enter-view, by thee appointed, we here both are met, Speake what canst thou demand from Englands Crown? Swanus. Thy Crown and Kingdome is by conquest won, yet if thou canst provide a Champion, that dares encounter mighty Colbron here; if he that Fights for thee, do win the day, all Title to thy Crown wee'l lay away; but if that Colbron gets the day in field, the English power to the Danes shall yield; and then thy homage and thy Princely Crown, will Swanus bear to Denmark as his own. Athelst. I force, perforce must yield to thy demand, But had I Guy of Warwick thou shouldst know, thy Gyants force he soon would overthrow. Colbron. I tell thee King, no weak-bred arm of thine, can shed one drop of mighty Colbrons blood, whilst I have power, or any strength to stand, or grasp this Truncheon in my Warlike hand; for in my Fury I will take my Foe, and fling him higher then the Moons bright sphear, then bandying back the Foot-ball of my rage, cast him down headlong to the Neighbouring Seas. King. No more, no more, to morrow is the day. Swanus. When Might or Right shall bear the Crown away. Exeunt. Enter Guy being Old. Guy. Thus one and Twenty Winters have I been, a very stranger to my home-bred soyle, and never set my Feet on English ground; in Foraign Countries have I eat my bread, and now bring Winter on my Snow white-head; which of my Friends that meets me by the way, will once imagine that I am Sir Guy, that vanquisht Knights, and made stout Monsters die. O, no not one, will once remember me, beauty and youth so little lasting be. What place is this, wherein I am Arrived? I know it well, 'tis call'd fair Winchester, whereas King Athelstone doth keep his Court, the nights far spent, and my age withered limbs, are weak, and weary, with long travelling; here will I sit and rest my self a while, He sleepeth. and with sweet sleep my wanward thoughts beguile. Enter Athelstone with Guy, disguis'd. Lord. What means your Majesty, thus carelesly to walk abroad without your wonted Guard? Athelst. I'le have no Guard, unlesse thy self with me, for know this Night as I lay in my bed, a blessed Angel bright and Christaline in golden slumber did appear to me, bidding me walk out of my Castle Gate, and the first man that I should meet withal, choose him my Champion to defend my right, which makes me rise thus early for to see this heaven bred Champion sent to let us free. Guy starts from his sleep. Guy. Give me my Sword, mine Armour, and my shield, that I may Coap with Hybean Hercules; the horrid villain in a Centaures shape hath ravisht Layda on her wedding day; therefore I hand to hand will Coap with him were he the Master Monster of the world: alas where am I poor distressed Man? my troubled mind utters I know not what, thou Fight with Monsters, Fight thou with thy grave, and for thy sins humble forgivenesse crave. But out alas, I fear I am o're-heard, He espies the King walking. I will enquire of these the ready way that leads directly to your City fair; good morrow, and God blesse you Gentleman. Athelst. Good morrow Father. Guy. May I be bold to crave which is the way, that leads directly unto Winchester? Athelst. This path good Father leads to Winchester. O heaven what should I think my dream pretend, that will'd me choose the first man I should meet; but this good Aged man is far unfit, yet will I ask his Counsel in this cause that may avail me far more then his strength, good Father may a stranger be so bold to have some private conference with thy self? Guy. Speak on good Sir and what so e're it be, My truth I give to keep it secretly. Athelst. Then know good Father that I am a King, my Courts beset with many Enemies, and this last night as I lay in my bed a Heavenly Vision did appear to me, bidding me rise up streight and walk abroad, and the first man that I should meet withal, choose him my Champion to defend my right; thou Aged Father art the first I meet, but he that doth maintain this Fight, is a most monstrous Gyant huge and strong, and thou art feeble, weak and impotent, yet thy Counsel Father, what I were best to do? Guy. Do as Heaven wills, ye do my Gracious Lord, if by the all fore-seeing power thereof, I am appointed for to do this deed; though I be old, yet you shall well perceive, I'le not give back nor yield one foot of ground; what though he be a Gyant that maintaines this deadly combate? ere I'le turn my face, I'le leave my body breathlesse in this place. Athelst. O how glad's my very Soul to see a youthful mind in Aged Livery! come Reverend Father, for thou now shalt be, a Kings companion that will honour thee. Guy. Go on great King, an old man once will try, the Vigor of a churlish Gyants strength; though he be huge and strong with whom I Fight, my God is just and still maintaines the right. Exeunt. Enter Swanus and Colbron. Swanus. Now Colbron rowse thy Gyants setled-limbs, for all our blessed hopes on thee we lay, thinking to bear the English Crown away. Colbr. I tell thee King thou troublest me with doubts, for halfe their Kingdome is already won by Colbron and the Danish Conquerours, upon the rest I will sharp vengeance take. Where are these faint-hearts? O that they were come, that I might finish up a day of Doom! Swanus. I hear them coming, therefore lets prepare, to bid them welcome to a bloody feast, for I perceive they all are resolute. Enter Athelstone with Guy and others. Athelstone. Swanus of Denmark, see wee keep our word, and come to try our right by dint of Sword. Swa. Bring forth thy Champion. Athelst. Here he stands prepar'd. Swanus. O, who? he alas poor silly man, give him a pair of Beads to pray upon. Athelstone. Scorn him not Swanus, for this old mans hand, against thy mighty Gyants force shall stand. Colbron. Must Colbron Fight with such a withered Ghost, a very shrimp, a worm, a gnat, a fly, I scorn him and will spurn him at my feet. Guy. Leave of thy braves, blaspheming heathen dog, for God whose quarrel I do take in hand will add fresh strength to these my withered limbs, these aged sinews that are weak and old, he can renew with monster conquering strength; therefore to shew, I do not fear thy threats, sound an Alarum lets begin the Fight, for with my Palmers staffe i'le coap with thee. Athelst. Thou shalt not hazard so thy honoured age, begirt thy self with these wars Ornaments. Guy. What shall I do? unhappy wretched man, for when I left the wars of Palestine, I made a vow even in the sight of Heaven never to Fight with Sword or Shield again; but I must break that vow, or leave this Land, my Native Country to the violent hand; of damned Usurpers, which shall never be, I'le break my Oath, and sweet Heaven pardon me. Here do I take this Sword into my hand, and buckle fast this shield unto my Arme, although I know it is no armed hand that can prevail, but Heaven where truth doth stand; and now thou great Arch-guyder of the world, that saved Daniell in the Lyons Den, look down on me, with thy all-pitious Eyes, and by my Hand vanquish thy Enemies, that all may say in Glory to thy name, that little David hath Goliath slain; St. George for England, lets begin the Fight, Angels by me defend fair Englands right. Colbron. In Mahounds name I do thee here defie, for I will crush thy bones immediately. They Fight, Guy killeth Colbron. Athelst. St. George, St. George, England hath prevail'd, and Denmark and his Champion now are quaild. Swa. Mahound Confound that old mans hellish Arme, that hath wrought Englands good, and Denmarks harm; now force perforce, to Denmark we must go, ne're had the Danes so great an overthrow. Exit Swanus. Athelst. Since by thy means most Reverend Aged Man, I and my Country are delivered, from the usurping Danish Tyrants power, I conjure thee by that holy vow which thou didst make in taking on this weed, of thy religious holy pilgrimage; tell me thy name, and what thy Countries call'd, which was so happy as to Foster thee. Guy. Upon Condition that your Majesty, will vow to keep close what I shall reveal, I will resolve your princely mind at full. Athelst. Speak freely then, for what so e're it be, upon my word I'le keep it secretly. Guy. I take your princely word then know great King, I am your Subject and in England born, and many favours have receiv'd of you, past the deserts of my unworthinesse; for which it glads my soul that e're I dye, I have done some service for your Majesty. When I was young, men knew me by my looks, but now the hand of age hath chang'd me so, that not one man doth Guy of Warwick know. Athelst. So said my soul, when I first saw thy face, welcome, O welcome, to thy Native soile, which thou hast freed from ruine and from spoil; and ten times welcome art thou unto me, thy absence long hath wrought my misery, But tell me, hast thou seen fair Phillis yet? Guy. My Lord I have not, nor I do not know, whether my beloved Phillis lives or no. Athelst. I can assure thee that thy Phillis lives, but her old Father Rohon he is dead; Sir Rainborn thy couragious hearted Son, Guy weeps. hath been these two years for to seek thee out, why weepst thou Guy? Guy. I weep for joy to hear this happy news, hath Guy of Warwick then a Kingly Son? and is fair Phillis still in perfect health? Athelst. She is good Guy, and i'le send speedy post, to Warwick Castle for to fetch her hither. Guy. O I beseech your grace to give me leave, an end of this my Pilgrimage to make; for when I took my way Palestine, I made a vow for seven and twenty years to keep my self unknown from all my Friends; full one and twenty are expired and gone, six more being past, I from my vow am free, and then to all my friends disclos'd i'le be. Athelst. I must consent, since thou will have it so, but at the six years end i'le come to thee, and with me I will bring so rich a Train, as shall in state, bring Warwick home again; till then I leave thee to thy sweet content, willing my life for thy good be spent. Exit King. Guy. Farewel my Liege, Farewel my Soveraigne, and now poor Guy, since thou art left alone, think on thy Makers mighty love to thee, who in thy youth did make thee fear'd of all, and by thine age hath wrought a monstrous fall; he hath preserv'd thy true and faithful Wife, whom thou didst love more dearer then thy Life; to her i'le go as fast as I can hye, but shee'l not think that VVarwick is so nigh: ah Phillis, now thy Lord is waxen old, who when thou sawest him last was stout and bold; yet as I am, I'le sek my Phillis Face, if he that made me gives me Life and space, I'le tell her tydings of mine own estate, and fetch my food at my own Castle Gate; And for six years which I alone must lead. Phillis must feed her unknown Lord with bread. Exit.</field>

Thus Guy to Warwick Castle now is gone, where hearing of the Almes fair Phillis gives to Palmers, that do daily passe that way; he thither goes, and at her hand receives his daily food; and being unknown, he tells her tidings of his own estate; and in a forrest not far from the place, a mile distant called Arden wood, with his own hands he builds himself a Cave. What followes now of Rainborn his fair Son, Sir Herodes meeting, and of their return, and what to Guy of Warwick doth befall, sit pleas'd a while and Time shall shew you all. Exit Time. Enter Guy Solus. Guy. Now am I come in sight of my fair Home, thats cal'd Guye's Crosse, for that I did erect, before I went to fair Jerusalem; here was I wont to sit and view my Land, and eke my Castle that on Tiptoes stand, to overpeer this part of Warwickshire. Enter two Palmers. 1 Palmer. Come hither, lets a little mend our pace, for we are near to Warwick Castle now; where I have heard of late fair Phillis dwells, who gives Almes to all that passe that way. 2 Pal. Good brother lets go thither presently; but stay, methinks here sits an Aged man, lets ask him if hee'l go along with us? 1 Pal. With all my heart; all happinesse attend you Aged Father. Guy. The like I wish to you good gentle Friends. 1 Pal. May we intreat you go along with us, to Warwick Castle, where fair Phillis dwells, who giveth Almes to all such as we are. Guy. With all my heart, I'le go along with you. Enter Phillis, and a Servant with Bread and Wine. 1 Pal. See where she comes out of her Castle Gate. Both Palmers kneel and pray. Heaven blesse fair Phillis for this deed, and send Sir Guy of VVarwick home with speed. Phillis. Amen, Amen, come give them a reward, there's Bread and Wine, eat and refresh your selves; and there's some Money to relieve your wants, and pray for Guy of VVarwick and his Friends. But wherefore stands this Aged man so sad? What art thou Father? Guy. A poor distressed Pilgrime gentle Lady. Phill. More welcome art thou unto Warwicks Wife. for in a Pilgrims weed my Lord is gone, even to the furthest part of Christendome. But tell me Father, hast thou travel'd far? Guy. Lady I have, and seen my Saviours blessed Sepulchre. Phillis. In all thy travels didst thou never hear of Guy of VVarwick, and his Warlike Deeds? Guy. I have both heard, and been with him, even at the siege of fair Jerusalem; where he perform'd such deeds of Chivalry, that by his means the City was preserv'd, and Sultan Shamurath with all his Hoast, was overcome and holy vanquished. Phillis. Let me embrace thee in my tender Armes, and kisse thy Aged Cheek, for until now, of my dear Lord, I never heard so much; reach me a stool, I prethee Father sit. Guy. Here on the ground I'le sit, tis earth and dust, from it I had my Birth, to it I must. Phillis. Give me some Bread? I prethee Father Eat. Guy. Give me Brown Bread, for thats a Pilgrimes Meat. Phillis. Reach me some Wine, good Father tast of this. Guy. Give me cold Water that my comfort is, I tell ye Lady your great Lord and I, have thought our selves as happy as a King, to drink the water of a Christal spring. Phillis. O do not break my sorrow beaten heart, with sharp remembrance of his miseries, that is more dear to me then all the world; but gentle Father for this happy newes, which thou hast told me of my beloved Lord; if in my Castle thou wilt stay with me, for VVarwicks sake I will make much of thee. Guy. I thank you Lady, but I cannot stay, my hast in Pilgrimage calls me away; therefore in duty here I take my leave. Phillis. O stay a while, and do not go so soon, for I am loth to leave thy company; this poor reward of Phillis shalt thou take, which I do give thee for my Warwicks sake; so fare thee well, whatsoe're the cause should be, my heart is full of grief to part with thee. Exit Phillis and her Servant. Guy. And mine of sorrow and deep misery. 1 Pal. Come Father, will you along with us? Guy. Go on good friends, I follow presently, Ex. Palmers. as fast as weakned age will give me leave. And now poor Guy fall prostrate on thy knees, and thank the God that gave thee such a Wife; Phillis when thou art dead and laid in grave, few such true Women will fair England have. Now will I hye me unto Arden wood, there in a Rock of stone I'le build a Cave; and of my Phillis fair, whom I love best, i'le fetch my daily Food, and thus in rest till full six years be brought unto an end, unknown to any, I my life will spend. Exit Guy. Enter Rainborne Solus. Rain. Now that the poasting Charet of the Sonne, hath tired Phœbus and his wanton steeds, the duskey Clouds hath closed up the day, and Hesperus is left to guide the world; Here Rainborne rest thy self within these woods, and give thy weary limbs some time of stay, until that Phœbus chase the night away; then will I buckle on my Armes again, and never cease pursuit till I have found my Warlike Father, the renown'd Sir Guy, He sits down. which I will doe, or in this journy dye. Enter Sparrow. A Pilgrimage, quotha, marry here's a Pilgrimage indeed, why? I have lost my Master, and have been this fortnight in a Wood, where I have eat nothing but Hips and Hawes, that ye may make Fiddle strings of my Guts they are so thin: but I am serv'd well enough; for when I was at home with my old Father, where I had my belly full of Beef and Bag-pudding, but I must be Travelling with a Pestilence. He espies Rainborne. But stay, who have we here? some Traveller I hold my Life on't, I care not greatly if I knock out his Brains, and then take away all his Money, yet sure he has not much, he has such fine Cloaths on; for commonly now adaies our Gallants in their Silkes and Velvets have the Divel dancing in their great Hose; for there's never a crosse to hinder him, therefore I'le wake him sure, Whoop whow, &amp;c. He Hollowes in his Ear. Rainborne. How now Sirrah, what are you? Sparrow. A Curstian, what art thou? Rainborne. Art thou a Christian? prethee where wer't born? Sparrow. Ifaith Sir I was born in England at Stratford upon Avon in Warwickshire. Rainborne. Wer't born in England? what's thy name? Sparrow. Nay I have a fine finical name, I can tell ye, for my name is Sparrow; yet I am not no house Sparrow, nor no hedge Sparrow, nor no peaking Sparrow, nor no sneaking Sparrow, but I am a high mounting lofty minded Sparrow, and that Parnell knows well enough, and a good many more of the pretty Wenches of our Parish ifaith. Rainborne. Very well Sir, what make you here in these Countries? Sparrow. Marry I have lost a stray Master, can you tell me any tidings of him? Rainborne. What was thy Masters name? Sparrow. My Masters Name, why you would not hear it would ye? Rainborne. Yes sir that I would. Sparrow. Well he has a tickling name I can tell ye. Rain. Howsoever let me hear it. Spar. Yes you shall hear it, he is cal'd the most Couragious, Bravagious, Contagious; but do you hear young Gentleman, have ye ever another suit of apparel ne're hand. Rain. VVhy Sir? Spar. VVhy truly all will not be well with ye if you hear my Masters name; therefore I would wish you take heed what ye doe, for you'l perfume that, so that ye will have need of another. Rain. Sirrah leave your prating, and let me hear it. Spar. Nay ye shall hear it, he is called the most Renowned, Profounded, Compounded; but heark ye, have ye ever a clean shirt about ye? Rain. VVhy Sir? Spar. VVhy? I know if you hear my Masters name you'l blow your Nose backward, and then your Landresse will call you Sloven. Rain. Why ye base Pesant, shall I not hear his Name? Spar. O Lord Sir, ye are deceived! I am no Phesant, though I be a Sparrow, yet you shall hear my Masters name, he is called Sir Guy of Warwick. Rain. Sir Guy of Warwick, my Renowned Father. Spar. Thy Father, thy Halter, indeed when I came out of England I left a Wench pretty and plump, thou may'st be my Son, if thou beest, kneel down and ask me blessing, and i'le give thee two pence. Rain. Away you base slave. Spar. Why dost thou think scorn to ask me blessing? Rain. I Sir that I do. Spar. Then I think scorn to give thee my two pence. Rain. Sir leave this talk and tell me certainly, where brave Sir Guy at this time doth remain, and with rich gifts I will requite thy pains. Spar. VVill ye so, why the last time I saw him he and I were going towards England, and in the midst of a great wood I lost him, but I had better have been hang'd or some worse mischance come to me, for I am like never to get-home as long as I live. Rain. Nay fear not that, for if thou't stay with me, for VVarwicks sake I will make much of thee. Spar. But are you Sir Guy of VVarwicks Son? Rain. Upon my Knightly word I am. Spar. Faith I doubt you are some lying Hangman; for indeed we Travellers may lye by Authority; but I'le tell ye what I'le doe, stay you here till I go into England, and ask your Mother, if she sayes so, I'le come again and then I'le dwell with you. Rain. Nay stay Sir, for it is above a Thousand mile into England. Spar. A Thousand mile, nay sure i'le take your word before i'le go so far to try the matter, but if I should be content to dwell with you, what dyet will you allow me? Rain. Why Sirrah? to your Dinner you shall have a Pomgarnate. Spar. A pound of Garlike, why I never eat Garlike in all my Life; Rain. I say a Pomegarnate, which is almost like an Apple. Spar. Apples to my Dinner, and what to my Supper? quickly, quickly. Rainborne. Why to your Supper you shall have a Couple of Olives. Spar. Nay that's not much amisse, for that is two leggs of Beef stuft with Parsley. Rain. You are deceived Sirrah, for an Olive is no bigger then a Plum. Spar. How Apples to my Dinner, and Plums to my Supper, O my belly, my belly, my belly; why Master you have kil'd me already, but i'le tell ye how ye must use me; at Eight of Clock you must call me up; but ye must not make too much hast, for I must have half an hours scratching before I can put on my Shirt; then betwixt nine and ten I must be at breakfast, and from eleven to one at Dinner, then I must go to sleep till three, then I must have my Afternoons Nunching, then at five of the Clock my Supper; and then what work you will all the day after, but you must not feed me with Apples and Plums, for I must have my fill five times a day of Beef, Brewis, Bag-Puddings and Pies. Oh how my Teeth waters to think on them, besides odd bits in a Corner; and if you'l deal thus with me, I'le dwell with you, and doe all this that I have promised you. Rain. That's eat your Victuals and sleep. Spar. Why aye and something else too, though it be no great manners to speak on't. Rain. But art thou sure my Father is gone for England? Spar. Am I sure? why I tell ye, he is in England long ago. Rain. Why then in hast i'le post to England now. but I'le not tarry in it, nor else where, unlesse I find my Warlike Father there; Come Sparrow follow me. Spar. Do you hear young Master, though you be my Master, yet I am your Elder, and therefore your better, and alwaies while ye live, learn to let your betters go afore ye. Exeunt. Enter Guy Solus. Guy. Thus have I almost brought unto an end, the tedious time of my long Pilgrimage, for of my seven and twenty year's remains only seven days to be accomplished. The longest Summers day comes to an end; The dials point though none perceive it stur, in length of time creeps round about the same; even so this long thought time is almost spent, onely seven dayes to come, and I am free, and then to all my Friends disclos'd i'le be. Enter an Angell. Angell. Thou blessed Champion of the highest Heaven, be firme in faith, and here my message out, for my great Master sends thee word by me, that seven dayes being past thou sure shalt dye; tears change not fate, poor pilgrime now farewel go meet more joyes then Angels Tongues can tell. Exit Angell. Guy. Welcome O welcome be thy glorious will, thou great Archfactor of the Firmament. O hadst thou let me lain but one day more, to have reveal'd my self unto my Wife, my dear, dear Phillis, who languisheth in pain, hoping to see her aged Lord again. Then had I been contented for to dye, So am I now, thou must be pleas'd, not I. Yet Guy bethink thee what thou hast to do, wilt thou not make thy self known to thy Wise? but thus unknown to any lose thy Life? where no man ne're shall hear of thee at all, nor give thy body Christian burial; Yes, I will hye me strair to Phillis Gate, and there reveal my self and my estate, and my dear Phillis, whom I loved best, shall close mine eyes, and bring my soul to rest. But wilt thou break that vow of sanctity, which thou didst make to him, that hath made thee; and seek to contradict his holy will, that hath shew'd such great mercies to thee still: O God forbid! That vow true kept shall be, I'le commit all to him that saved me. and when I dye, instead of Tomb or Grave, I'le leave my body in my stone cold Cave. Thither I will, and spend my short sweet dayes, in contemplation and in holy prayers; I poor old Guy go hye and hast thee thither, for life and Pilprimage must end together. Exit. Enter Sparrow Solus. Sparrow. Ha, ha, the world's well amended with me by-Lady, why? I am as plumb as a pudding now, for ever since I came to my young Master, I have been so puft up with good chear, that Barly puddings are no meat, nor Cheese-cakes, nor Custards, no banquetting stuffe with me; for as soon as ever we ca,me into England, my young Master goes to the Court presently where he and I were Counterpain'd with such implements as passes; I am tost up and down like a Shittlecock in every bodies mouth; for who but Master Sparrow, the greatest Traveller that has been at cost twenty Nobles and Jerico, and I cannot tell ye where; but for all that I was serv'd a Sluttish trick to day, for my Master being bidden to great a Gentlemans house to dinner, took me along with him to wait at the Table; wel as they were at Dinner, the Serving men as they took off the meat set it before the fire to keep it warm for themselves: I seeing the good chear standing in battle Ray, and having not broke my fast of all day, I began to draw near the fire, and look over my shoulder upon the victuals, at last I spyed a Fat legg of Pork; O how my Teeth did water to look upon't! I had not stood long, but seeing every body busie, I whipt the legg of Pork into my Pocket, and stood very mannerly with my hands at my back, as though I had done nothing; but it was not long, e're the Fat Pork with the heat of the Fire began to fry out of my Slops, &amp; all the dogs in the House came Snukering and licking about my Breeches, and not content with that, but one unmannerly Cur above all the rest, popt his Nose into my Pocket, snatcht out the leg of Pork, &amp; tore away all the tone side of my Breeches, that I was fain to go out edgling like a Crab ifaith; put i'le ne're steal Pork again while I live, i'le have one bit of Mutron whatsome're comes on't ifaith. Exit Sparrow. Enter Guy being in his Cave, to him the Angell. Angell. Now Guy of Warwick is accomplished, the full effect of all thy Pilgrimage, then rise and pray, thy sins may be forgiven, for Angels wait to bear thy soul to Heaven. Exit Angell. Guy. Gods will be done, I am resolv'd to dye, and have askt mercy at the hands of him that gave me Life, and now will take the same. O what a pretious soul hath sinful man! that in it self alone does comprehend the figure, state, and lineaments of Heaven, yet cannot measure nor define it self; so when that all great workmen of the world, had fram'd mans flesh out of a clod of clay, and all the Creatures of the Universal world, of the same mould, to whom his very word gave present life onely in mans brest, that vil'd ambitious sinful heap of drosse; he breathd his own breath, even the breath of heaven, that is the glorious soul we now possesse, which is immortal and can never dye. Yet he that late was fram'd of Mire and filth, plac'd in a glorious state of innocence, was not content, but striv'd to be as good as his great maker, who could with one word, throw him down headlong to the deepest Hell; yet he in Mercy, Love, and meer good will, did grant him pardon for his soul offence; and seeing him unable to perform his blessed will, did send his own dear Son to pay his ransome with his precious blood, and to redeem that soul which sinful man, had forfeited to Satan, Death and Hell; and for a death dam'd cursed and unpure, he gave him life eternal to indure; which life eternal, grant sweet Christ to me, that in Heavens joyes I may thy glory see. Enter Rainborne and Herod of Arden with Sparrow. Rain. Go good Sir Herod Post and meet the King, who now is coming with his warlike Troops, to meet my Father and to honour him, in his return from fair Jerusalem. Herod. Hie you to Warwick Castle to your Mother, tell her this happy news of his return, whose absence long hath made her weep and mourn. Come Sparrow you shall go along with me. Spar. Shall I go meet the King too Master? Rain. I Sir, you shall attend upon my friend. Spar. But I pray tell me one thing, is the King a Man or a Woman? Rain. He is a Man. Spar. Well, I shall never love him while I live, for a Cosin of his, the King of Clubs made me loose six pots of Ale, at Mother Bunches ifaith. Rainborne. Well Sir go along with him. Exit Sparrow and Herod. Now Rainborne glut thy heart with wisht for joy, O how it glads my soul, that I shall see, my dear loved Father once before I dye! The people flock together all on heaps, Clapping their hands, and crying out for joy, that Guy of Worwick is come again, and all report it of a certainty, that in the dreadful day of Winchester, he vanquisht Colbron in a single fight. Guy groans. But stay, methinks I hear a doleful sound of a departing man, and see here lies an Aged Pilgrime, at the point of death; what art thou Father? prethee speak to me. Guy. A poor age-withered Creature gentle Son, that streight must yield my due unto my grave, for age and sicknesse now my life will have. Rain. Alas, good Father thou art sick indeed, yet if thou canst but lean upon my Arme, I'le lead thee to a place where thou shalt be comforted and attended carefully. Guy. I thank thee Son, but cannot leave this place; yet if thy thoughts be equal with thy words, let me request one kindnesse at thy hands, it is the last that ever I shall make. Rain. Speak freely Father what soe're it be, thy will shall be perform'd immediately. Guy. Then unto Warwick Castle hie thee straight, enquire for Phillis Guy of Warwicks Wife, deliver to her this same ring of Gold, tell her an old door Pilgrime at deaths dore, did send it to her as a recompence, for her good deeds, to him and many moe, since her dear Lord away from her did go. Ramb. I'le give it her, as I have hope of Heaven, and bring her with me hither presently; that with sweet balmes she may comfort thee, so fare thee well, sweet heaven thy comfort be. Exit. Guy. Go on in peace, my peace with heaven is made, thou goest to carry such a doleful gift, as with the sight will kill my Phillis heart; for when I took my leave to go from her, that ring she gave me as a pledge of love; which if I see quoth she, and thou not by, Phillis will grieving weep, and weeping dye. O did she know her VVarwicks death so nigh, and he so ne're in a cold Cave to lye; she soon would come and take her last adue of him, whose love to her hath still been true; but shall I dye before I see her face? I feel death ceazing on my heart already; O my sweet Saviour strengthen me this hour, and in my weaknesse shew thy heavenly power. I come, I come, to thee sweet Christ I flye, save my poor soul, let my vile body dye. He dies. Enter Phillis and Rainborne. Phillis. O hast thee Son, and bring me to the man that sent this Ring, alas we are undone! it is thy Father Boy, good Rainborne run. Rain. You tell me wonders that amaze my soul, it cannot be my Father that should lye, in his own Country and his wife so nigh. Phillis. This is the Ring I gave him, which quoth he, nothing but death shall ever part from me. Rain. See where he lies even yielding up the ghost. Phillis. If it be he, he hath a mould Wart underneath his Ear. She looks under his Ear, and cries out, they both kneel to him. Rain. View him good Mother, satisfie your mind. Phillis. It is my Husband, Oh my dearest Lord! Rain. O my dear Father speak unto thy Son, but he is dead, and we are quite undone. Phillis. O gentle Warwick, speak one word to me, I am thy wife that seven and twenty years bewail'd thy absence even with woful Tears; speak, speak, if any spark of life remains, I'le think one look enough for all thy pains. Rain. See Mother now he looks upon us both, and see how fast he holds my Fingers now; something he wants, behold he maketh signes, that we with our two hands should close his eyes. Now it is done, see how he faints and dies. Phillis. O break my heart, that I with him may dye, that in one grave our bodies both may lye. Rain. The King is coming, good mother be content; O heavy is my heart, with too much grief is spent. Enter Athelstone, Herod with others. Athelst. Sir Herod of Arden this is the time and place, that I appointed for to meet Sir Guy, and do him honour as he hath deserv'd, but yet we have not heard where he remains. Herod. See where Sir Rainborne and fair Phillis sits, and in their Arms an aged Pilgrime lies. Rain. And famous Warwick in this Pilgrime dies; see mighty King, and worthy Lords behold the flesh and blood of him, that when he lived, was the most famous Knight that e're drew sword, or clad his loins in compleat Arms of steel. Athelst. O you have broke my heart with this sad news! i'st possible my dearest friend Sir Guy, should end his life, in such an uncouth place. O cruel fate! O woful destiny! arise fair Lady, sorrow helpeth not; for if that sighs, or tears, could ought avail, to bring his Heaven bred soul to Earth again; my Kingly tears should day and night be spent, to fetch it thence, but Heaven doth that prevent. Rain. Your Tears, nor mine, dear Mother can prevail, nothing at all, Heaven hath appointed this, Angells conduct his soul to endlesse blisse. Athelst. Rainborne 'tis true, sweet Phillis weep no more, lets comfort all our selves with thinking thus, we must to him, but hee'l ne're come to us; but in the honour of his worthy name, the shield-bone of the bore of Callidon, shall be hang'd up at Coventries great Gate; the Ribs of the Dun Cow of Dunsmore Heath, in Warwick Castle for a monument; and on his Cave where he hath left his life, a stately Hermitage I will erect, in honour of Sir Guy of VVarwicks Name, passe mournfully along, wee'l follow all his bloodlesse Corps, and heavy funeral. Four takes the body of Guy, the rest follow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Time with the Epilogue. Thus Time concludes this dolent History, And ends this Scene with GUY of Warwicks Death; So what is it but Time can bring to passe? Time layes up Treasure where ther's Vertue scant, And gives the silly Fool when wise Men want: Both Poor and Rich confesse my power Divine, And every one doth say, make much of Time, Through the whole World, while the world was Time rangeth, And 'tis mens manners, and not, Time that changeth. O you whose Souls look for Eternity, Rest in the peace of perpetuity, And kindly grant to this request of mine; For he's but young that writes of this Old Time. Therefore if this your Eyes or Ears may please, He means to shew you better things then these. Exit Time. Finis Guy of Warwick.</field>
