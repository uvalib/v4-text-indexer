      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. The pleasure I derived from Mdlle. Rachel's performance of the French version of Schiller's âMary Stuart,â induced me to undertake a translation of that piece for the English stage. On comparing it with the work of the great German poet, however, it appeared to me so much less worthy of the labour I was prepared to bestow upon it, that I determined to attempt an English version of the original tragedy, satisfied that it would be easy to reduce it to acting dimensions, and adapt it to the English stage, by following the plan of the French author, and retaining nothing of Schiller's work but what was essentially dramatic and effective, and bore direct relation to the heroine herself. The French play, though not a work of remarkable poetical merit, does credit to the good taste and judgement of the author as an adaptation to the French stage. M. Mercier has selected with considerable tact, out of the great store of materials opened to him in Schiller's noble work, what would make an effective and touching âacting play,â eminently calculated to display histrionic power, and excite the sympathy of an audience,âperhaps I should have said, eminently favourable to a display of the peculiar genius of any great actress representing Mary Stuart, the Bewundert viel und viel gescholten Helena of modern Europe; for of late years that part alone has been deemed worthy of the powers of a first-rate performer, though when the piece was first produced in Paris, and Mdlle. Duchesnois, in spite of her âstyle larmoyant,â and of her being the ugliest woman in France, charmed and touched all hearts as the representative of Mary, the part of Elizabeth received its due importance from the fine acting of Madame Paradol; and Talma himself did not disdain to represent that type of cowardly courtier craft, Leicester. In Schiller's play, the interest of Mary's situation is so equally balanced by the consummate skill with which he has drawn the character of Elizabeth, that I do not wonder at the great German actress, who is said to have displayed her varied powers alternately in the two parts. We can imagine Mdlle. Rachel a terribly true Elizabeth, and Madame Ristori has proved by her alternate representation of Schiller's Mary, and the Elizabeth of the curious Italian play founded on the life of the Tudor Queen, that she combines the subtle mental powers and keen intellectual force requisite to impersonate the English princess with all the grace, dignity, and tenderness which are the traditional attributes of her Scottish rival. With its peculiar fitness for the French stage ends, however, I think, the merit of M. Mercier's tragedy. It no more represents Schiller's noble dramatic chronicle, which may be called history set to poetry, than the adaptation of Hamlet by M. Ducis can claim to represent Shakespeare's great work. The French âMary Stuartâ is what every other French tragic drama was before the time of M. Victor Hugo's daring inauguration of the so-called Ãcole Romantique on the Paris stage; a set of circumstances peculiar to that play, with a set of characters common to all French plays in generalâthe âMesdames et Seigneursâ of the Spanish âCidâ of Corneille, the Jewish âAthalieâ of Racine, and the Grecian âMeropeâ of Voltaire. In his delineations of Mary Stuart, Schiller has shown the appreciation of genius for the value of truth, and with excellent judgement, by making her in the very opening of the play confess her complicity in the murder of Darnley, and the subsequent disgraceful elevation of Bothwell, he silences the the main accusations that could be brought against her, and to a certain extent disarms the reprobation that might conflict with the interest he wishes us to feel for her. She pleads guilty at the very outset, and begins with the humility of a penitent the course of patient suffering, which he makes her close with the constancy of a martyr reiterating the same confession of her early guilt. This is masterly; for in the first scene the admission of her crime inclines us to dismiss it with a certain leniency in consideration of the severity of her punishment, and in the last her repetition of the charge, which she admits, strengthens mightily the denial of the subsequent ones brought against her by her enemies. While thus happily evading the impression of personal detestation for these actions, and insisting with infinite pathos upon the cruelty and injustice of the treatment Mary experienced in England, Schiller shows with the utmost force and truth the circumstances which rendered her imprisonment and execution a political necessity, a measure of inevitable self-preservation on the part of the British Government, and vividly describes the incessant dangers and disturbances with which her mere existence threatened England and Elizabeth. The scattered rays of historical testimony are gathered into a poetical focus of light by his genius, and the creation of the character of Mortimer is the embodiment of all the sinister and furious antagonism, the unscrupulous and implacable hatred with which the dawn of our civil and religious liberty, power, and prosperity was menaced by the life of Mary Stuart. Not Mr. Froude himself, the zealous champion of the Tudor sovereigns (father and daughter), has drawn a more faithful and powerful picture of the perpetual alarms with which the Queen and country were shaken by the pretensions of the Scottish princess and the intrigues of her foreign kindred; and though, in his review of Mignet's damnatory history of Mary, he has treated her with the rancour of a partisan rather than the impartial reprobation of an historian, he has not surpassed, in his estimate of the mischiefs he attributes to her influence, the impression we derive of them from Schiller's play. On the other hand, nothing short of the poet's vivid illustration of Elizabeth's precarious position could mitigate, to any tolerable degree, the odiousness of the lineaments with which he has pourtrayed her. But while, with infinite skill, he compels us to admit the necessity of Mary's execution, he makes the agency of Elizabeth in it, and her mode of exerting that agency, the result of a combination of personal motives of the basest and most detestable nature; and if Mr. Froude may applaud the German poet's masterly description of Elizabeth's circumstances, Dr. Lingard, and every Roman Catholic chronicler before and since him, might rejoice in the character he has traced of the great heretic sovereign whom they delight to decry. The admirers of powerful dramatic situations will hardly quarrel with the bold violation of history which procures him the scene of the meeting of the two Queens; and the lover of exquisite poetry will forgive, for the sake of the pathetic beauty of Mary's outburst of ecstasy on finding herself at liberty in the Park of Fotheringay, the inaccurate geographical knowledge which makes her discover the hills of Scotland and navigable waters that bathe the shores of France in the midland county of Northamptonshire. This scene is generally considered the climax of the play in representation, and throws into comparative insignificance even the melancholy interest of the last act. The one which follows it was judiciously omitted by M. Mercier from his adaptation, and should undoubtedly be omitted in any English acting version of the play; for there is a coarse cruelty in the outrage offered to Mary by the insane fanatic Mortimer of which it would be difficult to make an English audience acquiescent spectators: nor can I imagine the genius of the greatest actress that ever lived investing either with dignity or grace the terror and disgust of a woman helplessly compelled to listen to such insults. The character of Mortimer is a powerful and true exponent of the peculiar class of men of whom the ranks of the Catholic party in England were then mainly composed, and from whom Mary's unscrupulous foreign partisans recruited their appropriate instruments; but in the treatment of it, and more particularly in the developement of his passion for Mary, we recognise the element of not very legitimate power, by which all Europe was thrilled and fascinated on the first production of Schiller's âRobbers;â an element which betrays itself in some degree in all his plays, and which made the arch-critic Goethe accuse him of a âlove for the horrible,â when he resisted Schiller's desire to have Alva introduced in the last scene of âEgmont,â a triumphant and malignant witness of his execution. Schiller had a more poetical nature than Goethe, but he had not the fastidious exquisiteness of taste which the great courtier poet possessed above any man that universal literature can showâa faculty which he had cultivated into such unerring perfection that we are tempted to consider it a natural gift, and to hold it the greatest of all his great endowments; forgetting, perhaps, that while it checked all excesses of intellectual extravagance, it dwarfed the growth of moral excellence, and ended by substituting the perception of beauty for the love of God and man. Of the scene between Melville and Mary, where she confesses and receives the sacrament, it can only be said, that it is impossible for English people of the present day to conceive of such subjects being made matters of theatrical representation; for in spite of the violation of all artistic propriety, and propriety much more serious than that which is merely artistic, by the mode in which it is now the fashion to represent the spectacle of human dissolution in all its terrible and revolting detailsâa sight round which awe and tenderness alike draw the curtains of reverent silence and darkness, and of which common respect for our common mortality should forbid the gross mimicry upon a stageâit is to be presumed, that it will still be long before the most holy sacrament of the Christian religion is considered a legitimate subject for dramatic exhibition in an English theatre. In reading Schiller's play this scene is one of the most touching, and of course the most solemn, in the whole composition. I think, however, that the objection which I applied to the last scene between Mary and Mortimer of being too horrible and shocking one's sensibility unnecessarily, is applicable also to Leicester's soliloquy after Mary's departure to execution; it jars upon the elevated pathos of her farewell like a harsh and violent discord at the close of some strain of celestial melancholy music. The exit of the Queen to her death after her parting words of tender forgiveness to her lover brings the pathos of the story to its legitimate dramatic climax. As the stage does not (and very properly) present to us the spectacle of her execution, the description of it by Leicester as he gathers its process from the sounds beneath the floor, adds nothing to our pity for the Queen, whose moral agony we have witnessed, and whose subsequent physical agony has the effect of a coarse bathos after the keener trial through which we have just seen her triumphant passage, while it disturbs with images of merely material horror the sad and sweet serenity of her heroic acquiescence in her fate. If it is urged that the miserable weakness and worldliness of Leicester deserve the retribution of such a situation, we can only say that he has by this time become as indifferent to us as to Mary, and that his tardy repentance and anguish can excite no sympathy after that which has been called forth by her. As detached portions of Schiller's work, the finest in every respect, I think, are Mary's entrance in the Park of Fotheringay, when the break of the blank verse into exquisite lyrics is at once most poetical, beautiful, and natural; Mortimer's description, in his first scene with Mary, of his conversion to Romanism; and Elizabeth's soliloquy before signing the death-warrant. The second is a wonderfully beautiful description of the peculiar fascinations of that Church which alone of all Christian Churches warrants and comprehends the application of all means to its own ends; the last is a masterly delineation of the great agony of contending motives to which Schiller represents Elizabeth a prey, and which reaches its overwhelming climax in this scene by the preponderance of those which urge her to sign Mary's sentence. The beauty of Schiller's plays consists chiefly in the power of the dramatic situations, and in the force with which the characters are delineated; the latter are generally, whether good or bad, of lofty ideal proportions, and the language in which they converse, always elevated and admitting no comic admixture, is rather dignified and declamatory than passionate, imaginative, or poetical. For these reasons Schiller's plays are by no means among the most difficult works that a translator can attempt to render in another language. The striking situations, the strongly-marked and rather stiffly-outlined characters, and the measured march of the stately style, present fewer difficulties than works in which the form of expression divides the reader's admiration with the thought or feeling expressed,âsuch as Schiller's exquisite lyrics, of which the grace and sentiment, no less than the peculiar charm of diction, evaporate easily in the process of pouring from one language to another their subtle essence. The respective merits of free and literal translation have been too often discussed for me to attempt deciding a question which every author naturally answers in favour of the style he has himself adopted; I have not intentionally followed either theory exclusively, but have rendered literally what appeared to me best so rendered, and with more freedom what seemed to lose force and expression by too absolutely verbal translation. The poetical âThouâ with which Schiller makes all who approach Elizabeth address her, is too opposed to all our ideas to be retained throughout, though I have allowed it to remain in the situations where the excitement of strong feeling might render it less strange and incongruous to the English reader; for though the Queen's Majesty did undoubtedly write letters to my Lord Leicester beginning âDear Rob,â the most assured persuasion of his great favour with his mistress would hardly have suggested to that nobleman that it might ânot be amiss if thou thoust herâ occasionally. To conclude, German scholars, or those who are only so much of German scholars as to be able to read Schiller's plays, will probably not read my translation, and will certainly not be satisfied with it, for I am not; and yet I have done as well as I could, and may perhaps venture to recommend my work to those who cannot read the original, as a tolerably faithful and not altogether inadequate rendering of Schiller's noble play.</field>

A royal frontlet set with precious gems, And wrought with the fleur-de-lis of Franceâhere, Drury, Take it, and lay it with the rest. [Exit Drury. KENNEDY. Must we endure this shameful violence? PAULET. So long as she possesses anything, She's to be fear'd; there's nothing but becomes A weapon in her hands. KENNEDY. Good sir, have pity; Strip her not of this last remaining treasure. Th'unfortunate cheats her dark present fortune With this poor relic of her former greatness, For you have taken from her all but this. PAULET. 'Tis in safe hands; and at a fitting time Will scrupulously be restored to her. KENNEDY. O Heavens! who, beholding these bare walls, Could e'er believe a queen had such a dwelling? No royal dais above her seat; no covering To keep the rough ground from her delicate feet. With coarse and scanty tin her table served, No poorest gentlewoman but is costlier furnish'd. PAULET. 'Twas thus her husband's board was spread in Stirling, While she pledged her gallants in cups of gold. KENNEDY. Not e'en a mirror's needful ornament. PAULET. No; for while she can gaze on her vain image She will not cease to venture and to hope. KENNEDY. No book with wise discourse to cheer her spirit. PAULET. She has her Bible, that will cleanse her heart. KENNEDY. Her lute ta'en from her, whose kind voice did comfort her With long-remember'd strains. PAULET. Ay, with lewd love-songs. KENNEDY. Is this the fate reserved for her who seem'd Born to be fortune's darlingâqueen from her cradleâ Rear'd in the splendour of the Medici's court, Where in an atmosphere of joy she flourish'd? Is't not enough to rob her of all power? Must you strip bare her life of every solace? The load of a great sorrow teaches greatnessâ Strength to endureâbut the noblest courage fails From day to day 'neath petty injuries. PAULET. Let her divorce her thoughts from vanity. A life of wanton pomp and luxury Is best atoned by lowly penitence. KENNEDY. And if her youth fail'd to resist temptation, That lies between her conscience and her God. England affords no judge with whom she reckons. PAULET. Where she has sinn'd there too will she be judged. KENNEDY. Your prison bars allow scant room for sinning. PAULET. Scant as the room, she has found it wide enough Thence to stretch forth her arm and hurl abroad Into our land the torch of civil discord, And 'gainst our queen, whom God defend, to turn Th'assassin's steel. From these close prison walls, Did she not summon Babington and Parry To the accursed guilt of regicide? Did her strait fetters hinder her from weaving Her wily nets round Norfolk's noble heart? An offering to her craft, fell the best head In all this land beneath the headsman's stroke; Nor scared his bloody fate from the same abyss Those other madmen that she beckon'd to it. The scaffold loads itself with daily victims, Given to death for her; nor will this end Till she, the guilty cause of guilt, ascends it. Curse on the day when first our shores received This queen of guiles, this Helen as their guest! KENNEDY. Yea, guest-like, with true hospitality, Has England welcomed the unfortunate, Who, since the day she landed on your coast, A fugitive and suppliant, seeking succour From kindred blood, 'gainst kings' and nations' rights Is held a prisoner here; in darkest durance, Has wept away the fair years of her youth; The dreary hours of her imprisonment Steeped in the very dregs of bitterness. And now as a common felon call'd to stand Before your judgment-bar, arraign'd and question'd, Challenged to answer for her lifeâa queen! PAULET. Peace! she came hither reeking red with blood, Hunted by her own people from the throne That she had stain'd with murder; hither came she, Sworn enemy to England's weal, to bring The bloody times of Spanish Mary back, To make our country popish o'er again, And give 't into the Frenchman's hand to spoil! Why has she obstinately still refused To sign the treaty drawn at Edinburgh? Her idle claims why doth she not forego, And with one stroke of the pen unbar her prison? No; she loves better to lie groaning here Over the much misuse that tries her virtue, Than to renounce an empty title's boast, Because she looks to free herself by summoning The devil of conspiracy to her aid, And, weaving her poisonous nets with subtle industry, Entangle in their meshes the whole land. KENNEDY. Sure sir, you jest!âa bitter biting jestâ That lends such dreams to one buried alive, To whom hope breathes no whisper; whom can reach No friendly voice from her far distant home; Who since long years beholds no human face Save that of her stern gaoler; who within The last few days sees herself watch'd and guarded By a new spy, your rude unmanner'd kinsman; And still new bars to her iron cage are added. PAULET. No iron bars can cage her cunning spirit. What know I but these prison bars are filed, Ready to break asunder at a touch; This floor, these walls, that outwardly seem fast, Bored through to let in treachery while I sleep? Accursed office fallen to my lot, O'er this ill-brooding mischief to keep watch! Fear hunts me up from sleep; all night I walk Like an unquiet ghost about my castle To see if the bars be fast and the guard waking; And trembling I behold each morning break, Lest it make good the worst of my forebodings. But it is wellâthere is some hope 'twill end; For I would rather watch the damn'd in hell Than this pernicious Queen. KENNEDY. She's here herself. PAULET. The crucifix in her hand, and in her heart Worldliness, wantonness, and boundless pride. [Enter Mary with a rosary in her hand; Kennedy goes towards her. KENNEDY. Oh, madam, we are trampled under foot; Hard-hearted tyranny knows no more bounds; And every day heaps some new injury On your uncrowned head! MARY. What is it, Hannah? What has befallen? KENNEDY. See, see here! your casket Broke open! all your papers! and the last Poor treasure with such love and reverence guarded, Sole remnant of your princely bridal gear, Lie in his hands. Now you have nothing left; Nothing of all your royal dowerânothing! MARY. Be comforted; these toys are not my royalty. We may be basely used, but not made base. Much have I learnt in England to endure; I can bear this. Sir, you have violently Seized upon that which I had willingly To-day deliver'd to you. Among those papers Is a letter to my royal sister; give me Your knightly word that you'll deliver it To her own hand, not to the hand of Burleigh. PAULET. I will bethink me how to deal with it. MARY. Sir, you shall know its import. In it I crave a weighty boonâeven to have speech With her own self, whom I have ne'er beheld. By men have I been judged, whom I admit not My peers, nor know how I should answer. Sheâ Elizabethâis of my blood, my rank, my sex; And unto herâa kinswoman, a queen, A womanâcan I utter my whole mind. PAULET. Madam, you've often trusted fate and honour To men less worthy of your good respect. MARY. Another grace have I besought, which surely Sheer inhumanity alone denies me. Long in my prison have I been deprived Of the holy Church's comfortable sacrament: Those who have robb'd me of my crown and freedom, And threaten now my life, yet surely seek not To shut the door of Heaven against my soul. PAULET. Whene'er you choose, the chaplain of the castleâ MARY. No; I will have no chaplain of your castle, But a priest of mine own faith. Moreover, Some counsellors and men versed in the law To help me order my last testament. The wasting tooth of this long prison sorrow Gnaws at my life; I fear my days are counted, And I would settle all things as for death. PAULET. That shall not be amiss; such cares become The case in which you stand. MARY. Nay, who shall tell me That this too tedious dungeon martyrdom May not be shorten'd by impatient hands? My last will, therefore, I'll set down, bequeathing Lawfully what is mine to whom I will. PAULET. You may do so; the Queen of England, madam, Will scarce enrich herself by plundering you. MARY. I have from all my loving gentlewomen And faithful gentlemen been separated. What has become of them? their services You have indeed constrain'd me to forego, But I would fain know how it fares with them. PAULET. Madam, your household has been fitly cared for. [He is going. MARY. Are you departing, sir, without one word To calm this terrible strife of doubt and fear, Beneath whose joint assaults my spirit quailsâ Not one poor word to lift from off my heart The deadly load of this uncertainty? Thanks to the watchfulness of your spies, I am From the whole universe cut off; no tidings Even of my own doom can pierce these walls. My life lies in the hand of mine enemies. A month of dreary hours has oozed away Since hither came your Lords Commissioners; Here, in this castle, like fate falling on me, A court convened with sudden hasteâmyself Cited to appear before it, unprepared By warningâunprovided with defence. Amazed beyond the use of my own faculties, I stood before an unknown tribunal, hearing Their cunningly framed and heavy accusations. Like ghosts they rose before me, and so vanish'd; And from that day terrible silence dwells Upon all lips. In vain I seek in your eyes To read if mine innocence and my friends' zeal Or the hatred of mine enemies has prevail'd. Oh, break this hideous spell, and let me know What yet remains to fear, or what to hope! PAULET (after a pause). Make your account with Heaven. MARY. I trust In Heaven's mercy, and I also trust In the justice of my earthly judges. PAULET. Doubt not, All justice will be done you. MARY. Is my trial Concluded, sir? PAULET. I know not. MARY. Is it possible They have condemn'd me? PAULET. Madam, I do not know. MARY. You are apt to make quick work, I know: belike My murder, like my trial, may be sudden. PAULET. Think that it may be so; so shall you stand With a spirit better arm'd for the event. MARY. Nothing can move my wonder, sir, decreed By the court in Westminster, urged on to sentence me By Burleigh's hate and Hatton's zeal; yet know I Some things the Queen of England may not dare. PAULET. From the Parliament and their own consciences Our sovereigns hold their limit of authority; And that which justice lawfully decrees, Fearless of the whole world they will fulfill. [Enter Mortimer, who addresses Paulet without appearing to notice the Queen. MORTIMER. You're wanted, uncle. [Exit Mortimer; the Queen, who has observed him with displeasure, turns to Paulet as is he about to follow his nephew. MARY. Hold, sir; one word more. If you have aught to impart to me, from you I will bear muchâyour age hath privileges; But I will not endure the insolence Of that unmanner'd youth; henceforth, Spare me the needless insult of his presence. PAULET. Even for that honest bluntness which offends you, I prize my nephew, madam. His is not A heart to melt in wily woman's tears; Spite of his foreign sojourning in Paris And Rheims, he's still an honest Englishman, And all your arts are merely wasted on him. [Exit Paulet. KENNEDY. This to your faceâthis insolent coarseness! It is too much. MARY. Oh no, it is mere justice. Oft in the days of my prosperity I lent to flatterers a willing ear; Shall I not bear the harsh voice of reproof, That never speaks save to adversity? KENNEDY. Dear lady, wherefore thus cast down and spiritless? Time was when you would cheer and comfort me, And I was wont to chide your too much confidence. MARY. I know him well; King Darnley's bloody ghost Threat'ningly rises from his grave before me, And he will never be at peace with me Until my cup of misery is full. KENNEDY. What thoughts are these? MARY. Thou hast forgotten, Hannah; My memory keeps truer reckoning. This is that anniversary of horror Which still I greet with fasting and with penance. KENNEDY. Oh, let the evil spirit rest at last! With years of sorrow and of adverse fortune Have you atoned the deed: the Church that holds The keys of loosing and of bindingâyea, And Heaven itselfâhas pardon'd you long since. MARY. Bleeding afresh, the long-forgiven guilt Throws the light covering from its shallow grave, And crying for revenge, my husband's ghost Comes forth; nor to his everlasting bed Shall ever sound of consecrated bell Or sight of the host-bearing priest dismiss him. KENNEDY. Not yours the deed; you did not murder him. MARY. I knew of it; I suffer'd it; and smiling, Beckon'd him to the death-snare. KENNEDY. Your weak youth Pleads some excuse for you. MARY. Yea, youth too weak To bear the load of guilt I laid upon it. KENNEDY. By bitterest injuries were you provoked, And by your husband's haughty tyranny. He whom from out his own dim destiny Your love had lifted as with power divine, Exalting him, your bridegroom, to your throne, With all your loveliness endowing him, And the great ancient glories of your crownâ How could he e'er forget that his high fortune Was but the gift of all-bestowing love? And yet he did forget it, thrice unworthy. With base suspicions he dishonour'd you, With coarse unmannerly roughness he offended Your gentleness, and lost favour in your sight. The charm dissolved that had deceived your eyes, You fled his rude embraces, and repaid him Disdain and scorn, his due reward. And he, Sought he your love again? to soft relenting Strove he to woo you, kneeling at your feet With fond humility and fairer promise? Not he; bidding defiance to your power, He sought to lord it o'er youâhe, your creature. Before your very eyes, by his command, Was the fair gentle Rizzio stabb'd to death. Ah, you but paid with blood that bloodiest deed. MARY. And bloody vengeance will come on me for it! Thou seek'st to comfort me, and speak'st my doom. KENNEDY. Because thou hinderedst not, thou didst it not. Passion's blind frenzy had laid hold of thee, And bound to the yoke of the seducer Bothwell. Ah, not alone the villain ruled thy bosom With man's supremacy of power and will; But with foul spells, and charms, and hellish potions. All evil artsâ MARY. His evil arts were none But his determined purpose and my weakness. KENNEDY. Not so; I say all fiends were leagued with him, Ere he had cast his devilish glamour o'er thee; Seal'd were thine eyes and ears to every warning; And woman's shield of fear thou hadst cast away: Thy cheeks, the home of blushing modesty, Glow'd with th'unholy flame of wild desire; The veil of secrecy thou didst tear off, And his insolent triumph trampled on thy shame. With stony brow thou gav'st to the world's eye Thy passion, to the murderer's bloody hand Trusting the sword of Scotland, which he bore, Amid the curses of the common folk, Through Edinburgh streets proudly before thee. Beset with weapons was the Parliament house; And in the very temple of high justice A bold and bitter mockery of judgment, Wrung by thy will, proclaim'd th'assassin guiltless. Yet further didst thou dareâHeavens! MARY. Speak it out; Before God's altar I became his wife. KENNEDY. Oh, let an everlasting silence cover That desperate deed, shameful and terrible, Worthy alone of an utter castaway! Yet, oh, thou art not suchâthou art not such. I know thee; yea, e'en from thy childhood upwards Have I been near thee. Gentle is thy heart; Thy nature owns the sway of modesty; Too light a mind is all thy heaviest guilt. Yet once again I say itâevil spirits There be, that in th'unguarded breast of man In fatal hours suddenly make their home. Terror begins in us their hideous work; And flying back to hell, they leave behind Desperate madness in the tainted bosom. Since that black deed that darken'd all thy days, Of nothing blameworthy hast thou been guilty. I can bear witness to thy life's straight course. Take courage, then, and with thyself make peace. Nor was the sin thou mourn'st committed here. Neither Elizabeth nor her English Parliament Can be thy judges. Violence alone Here bows thee down; and before their tribunal With the firm trust of innocence may'st thou stand. MARY. Who comes? [Mortimer appears at the door. KENNEDY. 'Tis Paulet's nephew; hence, sir! hence! MORTIMER (entering cautiously, to KENNEDY). Withdraw and watch. I must speak with the queen. MARY (with anxiety). Hannah, remain here. MORTIMER (giving her a letter). Read this paper, madam, And know me better. MARY. Heavens! what is this? MORTIMER. Good Mistress Kennedy, watch, lest my uncle come. Mary (to KENNEDY, who looks doubtfully towards the QUEEN). Goâgo; do what he bids thee (reading the letter). From my uncle, The Cardinal of Lorraine! from Franceâfrom France! âTrust in the bearer of this paper; in England You have no truer friend.â Is it possible? Am I not cheated by some vain delusion? A friend so near at hand! Now, whilst I lay Forsaken as I thought by the whole world, Youâyouâthe kinsman of my prison-keeperâ You, whom I thought my bitterest enemyâ MORTIMER (throwing himself at her feet). O queen, forgive the hateful impious mask, Which to have worn thus long I scarce endured. Yet I should bless it; to your feet it brings me, There to swear loyalty, help, and deliverance! MARY. Rise; you amaze me, sir! Not suddenly thus Can I from deepest misery spring to hope. Speak, sir, and make such joy seem possible. MORTIMER. Time flies; my uncle presently will be here; And with him comes the hated Burleigh hither. Ere with his dreadful message he suprises you, Listen how Heaven sends deliverance to you MARY. A miracle of its mercy hath it wrought. MORTIMER. Forgive if with myself my tale begins. MARY. Speak, sir. MORTIMER. My twentieth year I number'd, madam, Having been train'd in straightest paths of duty, And nourish'd in the deepest hate of Rome, When an unconquerable wild desire Drove me to wander on the Continent. The dreary Puritan house of pray'r, and home, I left behind me, and with rapid steps Passing through France, I sought with eager longing The beautiful Italian land. It was The Season of the Church's holiest feast; The sunny roads swarm'd with a host of pilgrims; Each sacred image wore a crown of flowers, And all the tribes of the earth seem'd bound to Heaven. The stream of joyful worship swept me on, And bore me on its waves even into Rome. O queen! how fared it with me when amazed I saw arise before me all the pomp Of lordly pillar and triumphal arch? The ruin'd splendour of the Coliseum Began the spell which soon a nobler shrine, In its bright world of wonders, fasten'd on me. Ne'er had I felt the power of art and beauty; The Church that claim'd me hates the soft enchantment That binds the senses;âimage will it none, And honours nothing but the bodiless Word. What then became I, as within the temple I trode, and heard the strains that come from heaven, And all the lovely witchery of form From wall and dome sprang into life before me? All highest and all holiest influences, Touch'd by the ravish'd senses, stirr'd within me, And holiest Faith visibly stood before me, When I beheld the angel's heavenly greeting, The Saviour's birth, the lovely Virgin Mother, Th'ascended Trinity, and bright Transfiguration; When in his splendour I beheld the pope Filling his holy office, and the people blessingâ What's the pale glimmering of gold or jewels Wherewith the kings of the earth adorn themselves? He only with unearthly splendour shines, And heaven's kingdom may his house be call'd, For not of this world is its glorious beauty. MARY. Oh, spare me!âsay no more!âforbear to spread Life's fresh and glowing pictures thus before meâ A miserable prisoner! MORTIMER. Such was I, madam; And, lo! my prison doors sprang openâfree Suddenly stood my soul, greeting life's light. Hatred I swore to my old narrow creed, With a fresh garland bound my youthful brows, And full of joy join'd those who did rejoice. With many noble Scotchmen I consorted, And lively gallants from the land of France; They drew me to the dwelling of your uncle, The Cardinal of Guise. Oh, what a man! Of what a steadfast and a sovereign soul! How truly born a governor of spirits! The express model of a royal priest! A prince of the Churchânone other like to him. MARY. What! you have seen the noble countenance Of that revered, that best-beloved manâ The godly guide of my inexperienced youth? O tell me, does he yet remember me? How thrive his stately fortunes? Is he still The pride, the prop, the pillar of our Church? MORTIMER. With excellent humility he stoop'd To be himself my teacher in the faith, And scatter all the doubtings of my spirit. He show'd me how man's grovelling reason still Led him to error only; that the eye must see What the heart must believe; that the Church needed One head infallible; and that the Spirit of truth Rested upon the councils of the Fathers. How quail'd before his conquering intellect And the persuasion of his eloquent lips, The puny forces of my childish faith! Back to the Church's bosom I return'd, And in his hands abjured my heresy. MARY. So you are one among the many thousands That he, like the heavenly Preacher of the mountain, Hath seized with his sacred might of eloquence And guided to salvation everlasting. MORTIMER. Soon after this, summon'd to France, he sent me To Rheims, where the holy company of Jesus Piously labour'd, training English priests. Here did I find that noble Scotchman, Morgan, And your faithful Lesley, the learn'd bishop of Ross, Dragging their joyless days of banishment Out on the soil of France. To these most worthy I straitly bound myself, and in their fellowship Strengthen'd my faith. One day it chanced That in the bishop's dwelling I beheld The picture of a woman, whose fair image Made fast my eyes and heart with strange emotion. My inmost soul was touch'd with the mighty spell, And powerless o'er myself I stood and gazed. âWell may you gaze in wonder and in pity,â Spake the good bishop, âon that gracious face; The fairest of all women in the world Is of all earthly women the most miserable; A prisoner for our holy Church's sake Languishes in your land this hapless lady.â MARY. Oh, faithful heart! No, I have not lost all While my ill fortune leaves me such a friend. MORTIMER. With words that thrill'd my heart then did he paint Your dreary martyrdom and your foes' bloody hate. Your royal lineage he laid before me, And your descent from the high house of Tudor; Convinced me you alone should reign in England, And not this after-thought of queenâbrought forth From an adulterous bedâby her own father Henry cast off for cause of bastardy. Nor did I trust alone his warrant for it; I sought the counsel of law-learned men; I studied nought but genealogies, And every source of knowledge that I tried Witness'd the strength of your most rightful claim. In England are you guilty but of thisâ That the land wherein you lie a prisoner Is your inheritance, your lawful kingdom. MARY. Thrice fatal right! sole source of all my wrongs! MORTIMER. Now came the rumour that you were removed From Talbot's castle to my uncle's guard. The wonder-working hand of Heaven I saw In this event, and the loud call of fate To me whose arm was chosen to set you free. My friends approved my hopes, the Cardinal Confirm'd them with his counsel and his blessing, And tutor'd me in the heavy task of feigning. Quickly the plan was woven, and I turn'd Homewards to mine own land, where I set foot Ten days ago, and stood in your royal presence. You I beheldâno more a painted image. Oh! what a treasure-casket is this castle; No prison, but a shrine of precious beauty, More full of splendour than the English court. Yea, and thrice happy they who may but breathe Within these walls the air that you inhale. Oh, wisely doth Elizabeth here cage you, Shut from all eyes; she knows that if but once Your gracious loveliness shone on the land, England would rise up as one man t'acknowledge you. MARY. Oh, well for me had England but your eyes! MORTIMER. The world would have them could it but behold you, As I have done, in your unworthy durance. With what a royal courage, saintly humbleness, You hourly suffer wrong and contumely, A queen amid all griefs and injuries. Nor can this prison dim your beauty's lustre; Each ornament of life is wanting here, But your mere presence makes a light and splendour. Oh, never does my foot approach this threshold That my heart thrills not with delight and sorrow, Beholding you. But the end draws near apace; With every hour the danger presses close. I dare no longer pauseâno longer from you Hide the stern fate that threatens you. MARY. They've sentenced me? Speak without fearâI shall not fear to hear it. MORTIMER. The two and forty judges have condemn'd you; The Lords and Commons, and the city of London, Vehemently demand the sentence be fulfill'd. Elizabeth still wavers, and makes show Of greater mercy than her counsellors, And therein shows false cunning, not true mercyâ Making it seem that they compel her will. MARY (with composure). Sir, you have spoken nothing to amaze Or fright me; even for such an embassage I have been long prepared. I know my judges, And I can well believe that, after all I have endured, they dare not set me free. I know how far they'll venture; in some dungeon All the remainder of my life must waste, And my revenge and right be buried there. MORTIMER. No, no! believe it not: not so will it end, Nor tyranny leave its damn'd work half done. Long as you live, Elizabeth's fear lives too; No dungeon buries deep enough your claim: Her throne stands safely only on your grave. MARY. What! shall the headsman's bloody gripe be laid Upon the head of a thrice-anointed queen? She dares not do it. MORTIMER. She daresâshe daresâshe will. MARY. Will she thus trample in the mire of infamy All Christian sovereigntyâher own withal? And fears she nothing the revenge of France? MORTIMER. She makes with France fair league and amity, And gives the Duke of Anjou her hand and crown. MARY. Will not the King of Spain take arms against her? MORTIMER. She fears no foreign arms while she keeps peace At home with her subjects. MARY. And to those subjects Will she dare give this hideous spectacle? MORTIMER. This land has seen, madam, of late too many Women of royal state come down from the throne And mount the scaffold: up those bloody steps Elizabeth's mother climb'dâand Katharine Howard And fair young Lady Grey had worn the crown. MARY (after a pause). No, Mortimerânever believe itânever. The care of your faithful heart blinds you for me, And conjures a vain terror to appal you. 'Tis not the scaffold, sir, that I need fear; There be yet other means more safe and secret Through which the Queen of England may avoid My claim: before she finds an executioner It will be easier to find a murderer. This is the fear that shakes me; and no cup Touches my lips but, shuddering, I bethink me It may contain a draught of my sister's love. MORTIMER. Oh, fear it not; nor open nor conceal'd Shall murder to your precious life draw near. All is prepared: twelve noble English youths, Bound by one compact all, this very day Have sworn upon the holy sacrament With the strong arm of right to set you free. Count d'Aubespine, the French ambassador, Knows of our oath, and join'd his hand to ours; And in his palace is our place of meeting. MARY. Ah, through my heart you send a thrill of terror, Not joyâa horrible forewarning of dismay. What is't ye undertake? Do ye well know? Do not the bloody heads of Babington And Tischbourne, rear'd on London Bridge, affright ye? Even in such attempts they found their fate, And only made my chains the heavier. Generous, and brave, and young, why should ye perish? Hence, and forget you ever have beheld me. Already 'mong your ranks Burleigh perchance Has sown his spies. Leave me, and live; for I Have had no friend that e'er was fortunate. MORTIMER. The bloody heads, set for a grisly warning On London Bridge, nothing affright my soul; Nor the disastrous fate of those unnumber'd Who found their death in the same enterprise: They found therein an everlasting glory; And blest are they who die to set you free. MARY. Nor force nor cunning can avail to save me. Powerful and watchful are mine enemies; And at my prison door not Paulet only, And his guard keep ward over meâall England Stands sentinel at these gates: Elizabeth Of her free will alone can open them. MORTIMER. Then hope it never. MARY. One man alone might do it. MORTIMER. Oh, let me know his name. MARY. The Earl of Leicester. MORTIMER. Your bloodiest enemy, Elizabeth's darling. MARY. If I can yet be saved, 'tis he can save me. Go to himâhasteâspeak freely with him, Mortimer; And for a witness that you come from me, Bear him this letterâit contains my picture. [She takes a paper from her bosom. Mortimer starts back, and hesitates to receive it. Nay, take it. I have carried it conceal'd About my person, for your uncle's watchfulness Left me no way to reach him; you are come, Sent by my guardian angel, to my succour. MORTIMER. Oh, madam, deign t'unravel this strange mystery. MARY. The Earl of Leicester will unwind it to you. Trust him; he will trust youâWho comes? [Enter Kennedy. KENNEDY. Sir Amias Paulet, with a lord from court. MORTIMER. 'Tis Burleigh: call your courage to you, madam, And with indifferency hear his tidings. [Exeunt Mortimer and Kennedy; enter Burleigh and Paulet. PAULET. Madam, to-day you wish'd for certain knowledge Of your fate; Lord Burleigh comes to bring it to you; With steadfastness receive it. MARY. Worthily I hope, as it becomes the innocent. BURLEIGH. Commission'd by the councilâ MARY. My Lord Burleigh Readily lends his tongue to the tribunal To which he hath already given his spirit. PAULET. You speak as though you already knew the sentence. MARY. Since my Lord Burleigh brings it, I do know it. To the business, sir. BURLEIGH. Madam, having referr'd yourself To the judgment of the two and forty peersâ MARY. Pardon, my lord, that at the very outset I must arrest your words. I have accepted, Say you, the judgment of the English peers. That have I never done!ânever; my rank, The honour of my people, and my son, And of all sovereigns, could I so deny. Your laws compel not meâbut if they did, Your meanest citizen, by those laws protected, Is tried by his peers. Have you a jury of kings To try me by?âmy peers are kings, my lord. BURLEIGH. You heard the accusations brought against you, And therein did acknowledge the tribunal. MARY. Through Hatton's cunning craft was I induced, For my honour's sake, and in unshaken faith Of the triumphant victory of my cause, To lend an ear to those same articles, And the grounds whereon they rested: due respect I meant to show your lords, but never meant To accept their right to pass judgment on me. BURLEIGH. Whether you admit it, madam, or deny it, Is a mere form without significance, Which will in nowise bar the course of judgment. You breathe the air of England, and enjoy Her law's protection, and must needs obey Its power. MARY. I breathe the air of an English prison. Call you that living 'neath the law's protection? Nothing I know, and nothing seek to know, Of your law's protection. I am not England's subject, But the free-born sovereign of a foreign land. BURLEIGH. And think you that the title of a sovereign Can give the right to sow bloody divisions In the bosom of the land unpunished? How stood it with the safety of all nations, If the sword of justice might not aim its stroke, At a royal guest, as at the meanest beggar? MARY. I fear and I refuse no reckoning: The judges onlyâI will not accept. BURLEIGH. The judgesânay, but, madamâare they then Drawn from the common herdâa sort of rabble? Shameless tongue-waggersâto whom truth and right Are things so vile, that they would bow themselves Readily to a judgment preordained them? Are they not rather the first men of the landâ Powerful enough to dare be true, and high enough To look beyond prince-fear, and all base custom? Be they not e'en the men who rule this nation Of free and noble people,âwhose mere names Are warrant against every doubtful thing? At their head stands the shepherd of the Church, The holy Primate, Archbishop of Canterbury; The excellent Talbot, Keeper of the Seals; And Howard, Admiral of our kingdom's navies. Say, could the sovereign of this realm do more Than choose the best and noblest of the realm To make them judges of this royal question? Is it to be believed that party hate Smirches such souls as these?âand can it be thought That forty chosen gentlemen should join To give a passionate perjury for their verdict? MARY. Wondering I listen to that eloquent tongue, That still has been so adverse to my fortunes. How shall an unlearn'd woman like myself Answer the master of such potent speech? So, were your judges such, sir, as you say, I needs must give my cause for lost, it seems, And call myself guilty, because they condemn me. And yet these names, by you deem'd of such virtue, Whose weight of worth must crush me to the dust, In the records of your country, sir, I see Filling far other and less noble parts. I see this high nobility of Englandâ The kingdom's lordly senateâe'en as slaves Of a seraglio's sultan, bow to the will Of my despotic uncle, Henry the Eighth. I see this immaculate House of Lords, as vile As the base rabble of the venal commons, Make and unmake their edicts; bind and loose The tie of marriage at their king's command; To-day the daughters of the royal blood Thrusting aside, with shameful brand of bastardy, And to-morrow calling them to wear the crown; And four times, under four successive sov'reigns, Suffering conversion, for pure conscience' sake. BURLEIGH. You call'd yourself a stranger to our laws. You are well versed in our evil fortunes, madam. MARY. And these shall be my judges! my Lord High Treasurer. I will deal uprightly with you, so deal With me. 'Tis said you love and serve your country And queen with true unwearied fealty; I well believe it. Not self-seeking policy Sways you, but the high interest of the realm And its sovereign. Even for that very reason Should you mistrust yourself, my lord, lest that Should seem to you justice and right, which is Indeed no more than a shrewd state policy. I nothing doubt it, by your side there sit Among my judges worthy noblemen; But they are Protestants, and jealous too For England's weal. Can such men speak true judgment On me, the Roman Catholic queen of Scotland? No Englishman deals fairly with a Scot: 'Tis an old saying, and so true an one, That never before any seat of justice May Scot or Briton witness 'gainst each other: Experience made this into law, my lord; And in old custom lives authority, So that it should be honour'd. On these islands, As on a narrow plank floating at sea, Nature together cast unkindred folk; Sharing it too unequally between us, And leaving us to fight out the division: The narrow Tweed, like a thread, alone divides The fiery nations, and with mingled blood Of neighbour foes oft are its waters thick. For a thousand years on either bank have stood, Threatening and sword in hand, the adverse races; No enemy strikes at the peace of England Who has not for his swift ally the Scot, No civil war bursts into flame in Scotland That is not fired or fann'd by an English hand, And never will this deadly hatred die Till in one Parliament, the lawgivers, And under one sceptre, the two peoples, meet. BURLEIGH. And such a happiness the Stuart's sway Had given to England? MARY. Why should I deny it? Yea, I had hope under the olive's shade Some day to join two free and noble nations, Nor thought in evil hour myself to be The victim of their mutual enmity. The ancient jealousy and envious grudge I dreamt I happily might quench for ever, And as my grandsire, Richmond, twined together The rival roses, the two rival crowns Of England and of Scotland, I might join. BURLEIGH. By an ill way have you walked to reach that goal, Who have set the land on fire, and sought to climb Through the flames of civil strife, the steps of the throne. MARY. Never, by the great God in heaven, never! When did I so? where is your proof of it? BURLEIGH. I came not here to wrangle, madam; nor is The case a matter more for idle words. Of two and forty voices, all but two Have spoken you guilty, in that you have broken The statute and decree but last year framed, By which it is enacted thus:ââWhenever Seditious tumult shall be stirr'd in the land, In the name and behoof of any individual, The Crown shall exercise its lawful right Of trial and of prosecution, Even to the death of any so proved guilty.â And since it now appearsâ MARY. My Lord of Burleigh, I nothing doubt that a decree expressly Made to condemn me, will be used to do it. Woe to the victim when one selfsame tongue Ordains the law, accuses, and condemns! Can you deny it, sir, that this new statute Was for my special overthrow devised? BURLEIGH. Madam, it might have been your special warning; You have yourself converted it to a snare. You saw the abyss yawning before your feet, And warn'd to shun it, cast yourself therein. You held intelligence with Babington, The traitor, and his fellow-murderers, Of all their movements you were cognisant, And from your prison guided their conspiracy. MARY. When did I thus? where are the proofs, my lord? BURLEIGH. The proofs were lately laid before the court. MARY. Copies of documents by unknown hands: It must be proved that I dictated them, That they were dictated in those same words By meâin the very words read to the court. BURLEIGH. They are the same received by Babington, For he confess'd to them before his death. MARY. And why was he not living set before me? Why was he hustled from the world so fast, Ere face to face he had been brought with me? BURLEIGH. Your secretaries Kurl and Nau depose, Upon their oath, the words to be the same Which from your own lips they wrote down. MARY. So then, On my own servants' witness I am sentenced, Upon the faith and truth of those who swearing, Betrayed their faith and truth already sworn To me, their queen and mistress, once before. BURLEIGH. Madam, yourself declared the Scotchman Kurl Upright and faithful, yea, an honest man. MARY. And so I might; yet as no man's virtue's proved Till it hath pass'd the hour of its temptation, Torture may have affrighted or constrain'd him To utter he might hardly well know what. Perchance he thought to save his own poor life, And not much injure me, by his false witness. BURLEIGH. On his free oath he gave his testimony. MARY. But never in my presence. How, my lord, Two witnesses yet live who swear against me! Let them be set before my face, and let them Repeat before me what they witness of me. Will you deny me what a murderer claims? From Talbot, my late keeper, did I learn That in this very reign it was enacted That face to face th'accuser and th'accused Should stand confrontedâbut I have been deceived: Sir Amias Paulet, I believe you honest, Prove yourself so, and answer me, on your conscience, Is not this, as I say, the law of England? PAULET. Madam, it is; so rules the right with us; And what is truth I may not disavow. MARY. Now, my Lord Burleigh, since with such a stress Your law is laid upon me to condemn meâ How is it that I may not share as well The power of your law when it protects me? Answer me, sirâwhy came not Babington Before me, and why am I not confronted With my two secretaries who yet live? BURLEIGH. Not only your confederacy with Babingtonâ MARY. Yes; only that have I to answer for, For that alone the sword of justice threatens me, Keep to the point, my lord; don't swerve from it. BURLEIGH. It is well known that with the Spanish envoy, Mendoza, you have traffick'd MARY. That's not the point; Keep to the point, sir. BURLEIGH. The faith of the land you seek to overturn, And all the crowns of Europe you stir up In war against us. MARY. No; I have not done so. But were it true even as it is false, What then? Here am I held a prisoner, Against all holiest right of law and nations. I came not with the sword into your land; Fugitive, suppliant, I hither came, Claiming the sacred rights of hospitality Even in the arms of my kinswoman, your queen; But violence laid hold on me, and fetters Were all the safe keeping afforded me. Speak, is my faith plighted to such a land? What duty, what allegiance do I owe it? I do but use the holiest right of nature, When from these chains I seek to free myself; Repelling force with force, and all the kings Of this hemisphere calling to aid my cause. That which in every war is lawful held, Loyal and knightly, nothing misbecomes me. Murder aloneâthe bloody secret stroke I may not dareâconscience and pride forbid it. Mine enemies' murder would dishonour meâ Dishonour, mark me, sirâI did not say That even that could bow me to your sentence; For might, not right, has come to be the question Between myself and England. BURLEIGH (significantly). Do not, madam, So vehemently on your rights insist. Stern right is seldom found the prisoner's friend. MARY. I am the weaker, you the stronger side; Use, then, your strength, so be itâmurder me, And to your safety offer up my life. But let the deed be called not right, but might; Borrow not justice's holy sword to stab The enemy you hate and fear; nor wrap In garments sanctified your bloody violence. With no such jugglery is the world cheated, For you can murder, but you cannot judge me. Cease, then, to strive the fruits of treachery, And the fair show of justice, to combine, And what you dare to beâdare to appear. [Exit Mary. BURLEIGH. She scorns us, Paulet, and at the scaffold's foot Will still defy us. That imperious spirit Cannot be broken; even her sentence brought not Perturbation to her soul; with tearless eyes And unchanged colour did she hear her doom. She craves no pity from us. Well she knows The uncertain humour of our English queen, And that which is our fear, lends her this daring. PAULET. My Lord High Treasurer, this idle confidence Will vanish with the vain pretext that feeds it. But in this trialâif I dare say soâmatters Have been in an unseemly fashion dealt with. Into her presence Babington and Tischbourne Should have been brought; and now her secretaries Should be confronted with her. BURLEIGH. Neverânever! It were not to be ventured! Far too strong Is the spell with which she sways the souls of men, And the mighty witchery of her woman's tears. If Kurl her secretary stood before her He would deny himselfâcall back his witness. PAULET. So shall the enemies of England fill The world with shameful outcries on her justice; And all the solemn pomp of this trial show But as an insolent outrage on the right. BURLEIGH. That is the very care that chafes our queen; O that this evil genius of our land Had died or ever she set foot in it! PAULET. Amen, I say to that! BURLEIGH. Once deadly sickness Seized on her in her prison. PAULET. Verily Her sickness would have been the health of England. BURLEIGH. Yet, had she hence by natural accident Been snatchedâwe surely had been held her murderers. PAULET. What then? men must have leave to think their thoughts. BURLEIGH. Yet were it wellâand not so loud a rumour Would it stirâ PAULET. What matters it how loud? Not loud but rightful blame alone can harm us. BURLEIGH. Yet highest right sometimes escapes not censure; Opinion still leans towards th'unfortunate, And envy follows only those who triumph. The sword of justice that becomes a man, Seems horrible in a woman's hand; the world Believes not in the justice of one woman Of which another is the sacrifice. Vainly we judges have pronounc'd the sentence; With the queen remains the royal right of mercy, And she must use itâ'twould not be endured That she should bid the sentence be fulfilled. PAULET. And soâ BURLEIGH. And so this woman lives; no, never! Even this it is that weighs upon the queen, Scaring her sleep away; in her eyes I read Her spirits' ceaseless strife; nor dare she utter The wish that speaks in her careworn troubled looks: âWill none of all my servants save me from The bitter choiceâfor ever on my throne To quake with fear, or, with a ruthless hand, To thrust a queen and my near kinswoman Under the headsman's axe?â PAULET. 'Tis even thus; Of hard necessity, thus must it be! BURLEIGH. And yet the queen might deem it need not be, If she had faithful and observant servants. PAULET. Observant! BURLEIGH. Yea, such as could understand The silent meaning of a mute command. PAULET. A mute command? BURLEIGH. Who, trusted with the keeping Of a venomous viper, guarded the deadly thing Not as a holy and a precious treasure. PAULET (emphatically). And such a treasure is the unspotted name And unsuspected faith of our queen and mistress; No man can guard it, sir, too sacredly. BURLEIGH. When from the keeping of the Earl of Shrewsbury This wily prisoner to yours was given, Paulet, 'twas thoughtâ PAULET. 'Twas thought, my lord, no doubt, That truest hands should hold the heaviest trust; By Heav'n! ne'er had I consented to receive The unwelcome office, but that I thought it needed As good a man as England could afford! Let me not think I owe the hateful honour To anything but my well-known honesty. BURLEIGH. Say it were rumour'd that her health is failing, And day by day she sicken'd, and so sank Out of the voice and memory of men,â Your hands are clean. PAULET. But not my conscience, too! BURLEIGH. Enough! since your conscience is too squeamish, sir, At least you'll offer no impedimentâ PAULET (interrupting him). No murderer shall cross this thresholdâno! As long as my household gods protect her head, Her life is sacred to me; not more sacred Is the dear life of the queen of England to me. You are her judgeâjudge her, and sentence her; And when the hour is come, send hither, and build The scaffoldâto the sheriff and the headsman My gates shall be unbarr'd; but until then, She's trusted to my care, and I'll so keep her That she shall neither do, nor suffer harm. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene 1. The Palace in Westminster. Enter the Earl of Kent and Sir William Davison, meeting. DAVISON. Is't you, my Lord of Kent, from the tournament So soon return'd? Is all the bravery over? KENT. How, were you not at the jousting? DAVISON. That might not The duties of mine office well allow. KENT. Then you have lost the finest spectacle That ever taste devised or wit conducted. There was display'd how the fortress of Chaste Beauty Is by Desire besieged; the Lord High Marshal And the Chief Justice, the Seneschal, and ten Of the queen's knights, defended the fair fortress; And the French cavaliers attacked its walls. First there appeared a herald, who did demand, In a choice madrigal, the tower's surrender; And from the wall the Chancellor replied; Thereon th'artillery play'd, and flowery wreaths And costly perfumed essences were fired From the dainty mimic ordnanceâbut in vain; The storm was driven backâDesire retreated. DAVISON. A sign of evil omen sure, my lord, For the French marriage suit; is it not? KENT. Nay, this was but a jest. I think in earnest That the fair fortress will surrender. DAVISON. Do you? So do not I, my lord. KENT. Why, the hardest Articles of the treaty France agrees to: Monsieur will in a private chapel hold His own religious ceremonies, and openly The faith of the land swear to preserve and honour. Had you beheld the people's joy when these Good news were spread abroad! for this has been The constant dread of all the landâthat the queen Should without issue die, and so the realm Papist become again, if to the throne The Stuart should succeed. DAVISON. That fear is needless; One to a bridal chamber is bound, the other To her grave. KENT. The queen! Enter Elizabeth, ushered by Leicester, followed by Count d'Aubespine, Bellievre, Shrewsbury, Burleigh, and other French and English lords. ELIZABETH (to AUBESPINE). Count d'Aubespine, I pity These noble gentlemen, whose gallant zeal Hath led them hither o'er the sea; full sorely Must they miss here the glories of St. Germain's; My poor court ill can furnish feasts of the gods Such as the royal Mother of France commands. A glad and a good people, who whene'er I come abroad among them throng around My litter with their blessingsâthis is all The lordly show, that with some pride I give To foreign eyes. The noble maiden loveliness That blooms round Katharine like a flower garden Throws into shade me, and my homely merits. AUBESPINE. The court of Westminster shows but one lady To the amazed stranger; but in that one Every enchanting charm of her sex is gather'd. BELLIEVRE. Most gracious Majesty of England, deign To grant us leave humbly to take our leave, And make our royal master the Duke of Anjou Glad with the joyful tidings that we bear. In Paris would not his impatient heart Suffer him to abideâhe waits at Amiens The messengers of his happiness; yea, even As far as Calais have his posts been sent, Swift, as with wings, to bear the gracious word Of your consent, soon as your royal lips Speak it, to his intoxicated ear. ELIZABETH. Press me no further now, my Lord Bellievre; This is no time, again I say it, wherein To kindle the joyful hymeneal torch. Dark hangs the threatening sky above the land, And mourning garments would become me better Than the gay splendour of a wedding gear, For near and heavily a woeful blow Threatens my heart and house. BELLIEVRE. Your promise, madamâ Vouchsafe us that; and happier days shall bring The glad fulfilment. ELIZABETH. Slaves of their state are kings! And never may they take their heart for guide. It was my dearest wish to die unmarriedâ Therein, indeed, had I set my chiefest gloryâ That graven on my tomb it should be read: âHere sleeps the Virgin Queen;â but so my subjects Will not have it. Already they devise For the time when I shall be no more; the present, With all its blessings, cannot satisfy them, And to their future weal I must give up Myself, and what I prize my highest goodâ My maiden freedom; so will my people have it; And so they put a master over me. Well do they prove they hold me but a woman! And yet I thought I had ruled them manfullyâ Yea, like a king. Well wot I that they serve Not God the best who spurn the law of nature; And those did well who filled this seat before me, Who opened wide the cloister doors, and sent Back to the holiest duties of their kind Thousands of superstition's pining victims;â But a queen, whose days never in idle pomp Were wasted, who unweariedly fulfils The heaviest of all labours, she, methinks, From nature's common yoke might be exempt. One half of the human species holds the other Subject. AUBESPINE. Each several virtue, royal lady, Have you honour'd on your throne; yet none is greater Than that you show the sex whose pride you are, The shining pattern of their especial glory. Well I believe there lives no man on earth Worthy thy freedom's costly sacrifice; And yet if royal blood, and noble virtue, And manly comeliness, may mortal man Make worthy of that honour, thenâ ELIZABETH. No doubt, My lord ambassador, that an alliance With France's royal son would honour me; Moreover, I will openly confess, If it must beâif I can do no other But yield to my people's importunity (And much I fear 'twill stronger prove than I), Then, in all Europe know I of no prince To whom with less unwillingness I could Surrender the fair jewel of my freedom. Let this confession satisfy you, sir. BELLIEVRE. Fairest of hopesâit is but hope; my master Would fain crave more. ELIZABETH (draws a ring from her finger and looks at it thoughtfully). What more? Shall a queen have No greater privilege than a citizen's wife, Exchanging equal signs of equal troth-plight And equal bonds? Marriage is made with rings, And chains are made of rings too; bear this token To his highness; it is yet no chain, nor binds me; But it may be a link of one that will. BELLIEVRE (kneeling to receive the ring). In his name, mighty queen, kneeling, I take This token, and the kiss of humblest homage, Lay on my lady's hand. ELIZABETH (to Leicester, whom she has been observing during the foregoing dialogue). With leave, Lord Leicester. [She takes the order of the George from him, and hangs it round Bellievre's neck. Invest his highness with this knightly badge, And bid him swear the Order's oath to me: âHoni soit qui mal y pense!â for ever vanish Mistrust between our nations, and a bond Of closest confidence henceforth combine The crowns of England and of France! AUBESPINE. Great queen, this is a day of joyâso be it Fully and perfectly! and may to-day No tears be shed throughout this land! Mercy Shines in thy countenance; oh, let the rays Of its blessed light fall on a wretched princess, Who, near allied alike to France and Englandâ ELIZABETH. No further, countâlet us not mix together Two wholly separate matters. If indeed France holds our union dear, then must she needs Embrace my cause, nor be my enemy's friend. AUBESPINE. France were unworthy in your own eyes, madam, If she forgot, in the hour of this alliance, The hapless widow of her kingâthe daughter Of her own faith. Humanity and honour Alike demandâ ELIZABETH. Sir, I accept your words As a decorous, seemly intercession; France doth discharge the duty of a friend, That of a queen must be to me conceded. [She bows to the French lords, who, with their suite and all but the following persons, respectfully withdraw. Manent Elizabeth, Leicester, Burleigh, Talbot. The Queen seats herself. BURLEIGH. Illustrious sovereign! you to-day have crown'd The dearest wishes of your faithful people! Now, for the first time, may we well rejoice, And feel the blessings of the fortunate days You give to us, now that no more with trembling We look towards a tempest-brooding future. One only care now weighs upon the land, One victim that all voices clamour for. Grant you but this, and ground from this day forth On an assured foundation England's weal. ELIZABETH. What will my people further?âspeak, my lord. BURLEIGH. They ask the head of Mary Stuart: if You to your people would most surely give The precious gift of freedom, and the light Of dear-won truthâshe must no longer live. If for your sacred life we must not quake With daily fears, your enemy must fall. Well do you know your subjects do not own One common creed; and Rome's idolatry Claims many a secret votary in the land, Who feed their hopes with thoughts of bitter hate. On Mary Stuart hang their hearts: they are All bound in secret to the Lorrain princess, Irreconcilable enemies of your name. This raging faction have against you sworn War to extermination, with hell's weapons. In Rheims, the seat of the Cardinal Archbishop, They hold their arsenal and forge their bolts; There regicide is taught, and busily Forth send they hither from that goodly school Upon their mission resolute fanatics, Shrouded in every guise: already thence The third assassin has been hither sped; And unexhausted from this noisome den The tribe of hidden foes for ever rises. And yonder sits, in Fotheringay Castle, The AtÃ© of this endless war, who with The torch of love sets the whole land on fire. For her, who flatters each with a false hope, Youth doth devote itself to certain death. To set her free, that is their hopeâto seat her Upon your throne, that is the aim of all. For by the House of Lorrain your sacred right Stands unconfess'dâto them you will for ever Be an usurper, crown'd by chance alone; By them, inspired with folly, did she sign Herself the queen of Englandâthere's no peace Possible between you and them: you must Suffer or strike the blow, and to the end Her life is death to youâher death your life. ELIZABETH. A heavy office have you chosen, sir. I know the honest purpose of your zeal, And that you utter nothing but pure wisdom; But the wisdom whose decree is blood-shedding I do abhorâyea, from my inmost soul. Bethink you of some milder counsel. Noble lord Of Shrewsbury, let us hear your thinking. TALBOT. A worthy praise, madam, you have bestow'd Upon the zeal that fires Lord Burleigh's breast; My heart with no less loyal duty throbs, But the great gift to speak it is not mine. Still may you live to be your people's joy, And to prolong in this land the reign of peace; Never hath England happier days beheld Since it hath known a lawful sovereign's sway. May this prosperity cost no jot of honour, Or if it must, may Talbot's eyes ne'er see it! ELIZABETH. Now Heaven forfend our honour should be stain'd! TALBOT. Bethink you, then, upon some other means To save your kingdom, for Mary Stuart's death Is an unrighteous means. You cannot sentence One who is not your subject. ELIZABETH. My council errs then, My parliament doth err, and each tribunal Through the whole land that sanctions it, doth err? TALBOT. Mouth honour, madam, is no proof of right; England is not the world, her parliament Is not a gathering of all the nations, This hour, to-day, is not all future time, Neither is it the past. As you incline The wills of others, so doth sink or rise The unstable wave of judgment: never plead That you obey a stern necessity And your people's urging; even when you will, Yea, in that instant, may you prove and find The freedom of your will. So prove itâshow That blood appalls youâthat your sister's life You will not sacrifice; show unto them Who counsel otherwise your royal wrath; Then will this phantom of necessity Vanish, and what seemed right shall straight be wrong. You are the judge aloneâupon this reed That bends beneath you 'tis in vain to lean. Faithfully follow your own milder instinct. God sow'd not strength in woman's gentle heart; And they who framed our goodly government, Trusting to woman's hands the reins of rule, Meant not stern strength should be the virtue paramount Of kings who reign over this English land. ELIZABETH. How warm an advocate is my Lord Shrewsbury For one who is mine and my kingdom's enemy! I choose the counsel that doth love my welfare. TALBOT. No advocate was granted her; none dare To speak in her behalf, and set himself Against your wrath unarm'd. Mine be it then, Who, old, and tottering on the brink of the grave, Can feel no more the lure of earthly hopes, Thus to defend the utterly forlorn. Be it not said that in your kingdom's councils Passion and selfishness may cry aloud, And only mercy have no leave to speak. Banded against her everything conspires; You never have beheld her countenance, And nothing in your heart pleads for the stranger. I name not now her guilt. It has been said Her husband with her cognisance was murder'd; Certain it is, she wed his murderer. A heavy crime! and yet when it befell The times were dark, and full of luckless deeds. In the fierce stress of furious civil strife, Where weak and helpless she beheld herself With vassal violence hemm'd in and threaten'd, She cast herself into the strongest arms, Compell'd, who knows by what a cunning force, For woman is a frail and fearful thing. ELIZABETH. Woman is not weak! strong souls enough, I ween, Are to be found among us. In my presence Nothing of woman's weakness will I hear. TALBOT. To you misfortune was a school of strength; Life turn'd not upon you its smiling aspect; No throne beckon'd you from afar, but at your feet A grave for ever yawn'd. In Woodstock's shades, And in the Tower's gloom, the merciful Father Of our dear land taught you, through sorrow's discipline, Duty's stern lore. No flatterer sought you there. Wrapt in itself, your spirit, undisturb'd By the wild uproar of the world, betimes Learn'd to reflect, and prize this life's real treasure. No God so rescued her. A little child, She was transported to the court of France, That court of vanity and thoughtless pleasure, Where in one endless revel of delight She never heard the sober voice of truth; Dazzled by vicious folly's glittering pomp, And swept away upon corruption's stream, To her was beauty's idle crown allotted, Blooming, she far outshone all other women, And her fair face no less than royal birthâ ELIZABETH. Come to yourself, my Lord of Shrewsbury! Bethink you that we here in council sit. Forsooth, those must be wondrous charms indeed, That thus can set a hoary head on fire; Lord Leicester, you alone keep silence still, That which lets loose his tongue, perchance binds yours? LEICESTER. Madam, amazement only keeps me silent That terrors such as these should fill your ears; That the idle tales in London streets, believed And dreaded by the credulous mob, should find An echo in your council chamber walls, And busy wise, grave men with foolish rumours. Yea, I confess, I'm seized with admiration, To think this landless Queen of Scots, who could not Keep her own petty throne in her possessionâ Her vassals' scornâfrom her own country drivenâ Is made to fright you even from her prison. But in Heaven's name! what makes her to be fear'd? That she lays claim to this kingdom, and that you Her kinsmen Guise acknowledge not its queen? But can the Guises' will annul the right Given by your birth, and by our Parliament? Is she not by King Henry's latest testament Rejected silently? and will this land, Happy in the enjoyment of new light, Cast itself back into the Papist's arms, Turning from you their worshipp'd queen, to her, The murderess of Darnley? What means this haste, That while you yet live scares you with your heirâ That cannot fast enough in wedlock fetter you To save from sudden ruin Church and State? Are you not in your bloom of youthful vigour, While towards her grave she withers day by day? God send you long above that grave to tread, Without the need of thrusting her into it! BURLEIGH. Lord Leicester has not always counsell'd so. LEICESTER. No; it is true, my voice was for her death When we in judgment sat: we're now in council, And here the question is no more of right, But of expediency. Is this a time To fear her dangerous when France forsakes her, Her sole defender, to whose son your hand Is promised, while a royal race already In the people's hope blooms once more o'er the land? Why put to death one who is dead already? Contempt is absolute deathâbeware, lest pity Call her again into a dangerous life. My counsel therefore is, that she remain Under the sentence late pronounced upon her. Beneath the headsman's axe still let her live; When the first hand is raised in her defence, Let it come down. ELIZABETH (rising). I have your counsel, lords, And thank you for your zeal. With Heaven's help, Which doth the souls of kings enlighten, We will consider them, and on the best Determine. Hither comes Sir Amias Paulet. Now, worthy Paulet, what wouldst thou with us? [Enter Paulet and Mortimer. PAULET. Most glorious Majesty, my nephew, late Return'd from distant travel, at your feet Casts himself with his youthful fealty; Graciously deign to accept it, and let him grow In the good sunshine of your royal favour. MORTIMER (kneeling). Long live my sovereign Mistress, and may glory And happiness circle her brow for ever! ELIZABETH. Arise! you're welcome back to England, sir. You've trod the great highway, visited France And Rome, and rested too at Rheims, And so can tell what webs our foes are weaving. MORTIMER. Confound them, Heaven! and back to their own breasts Direct the arrows aim'd against our queen! ELIZABETH. Did you see Morgan? and that plot-spinner The Bishop of Ross? MORTIMER. With all the Scottish exiles, Who forge at Rheims their plots against this island, I held acquaintance, crept into their trust, That I might gather something of their aims. PAULET. Secret epistles for the Queen of Scotland, Written in cipher, were entrusted to him, Which faithfully he gave into my hands. ELIZABETH. What now resolve they? MORTIMER. Like a thunder-clap, France's desertion from their cause, and bond with you, Fell on them. Now towards Spain they turn their hopes. ELIZABETH. So Walsingham writes me. MORTIMER. And there came to Rheims, Even as I parted thence, Pope Sixtus' bull, Launch'd from the Vatican against your highness; 'Twill reach our shores with the first ship that anchors. LEICESTER. England no longer trembles at such weapons. BURLEIGH. They may be dangerous yet in fanatic hands. ELIZABETH (looking searchingly at MORTIMER). You have been accused of studying in the college At Rheims, and there forswearing your first faith. MORTIMER. I thought it well to assume that safe pretence, And so far went my hope to serve my queen. ELIZABETH (to PAULET, who presents a paper to her). What tenderest thou there? PAULET. To your grace's hand The Queen of Scotland sendsâ BURLEIGH (hastily extends his hand). Give it to me, sir! PAULET. By your leave no, my Lord High Treasurer. Into my royal mistress' hands I swore I would deliver this; so was I bidden. Though I am not the Queen of Scotland's friend, Yet am I but the enemy of her guilt; Therefore whate'er behest of hers may fit With my duty, I hold also fit to do. [Elizabeth takes the paper and reads it. BURLEIGH (to PAULET). What should it signify? idle complaints, Wherewith the gentle heart of our noble mistress Again shall be disturb'd and put in doubt. PAULET. She did not hide the matter from me, but Confess'd she had implored her grace to see her. BURLEIGH. Never! SHREWSBURY. Why not? methinks she prays right well. BURLEIGH. Grace to behold the royal countenance The murderess hath forfeited! Shall she Who sought the life of our queen approach her presence? Who truly loves and serves our royal mistress, Will give her no such counsel. SHREWSBURY. Nay; but if Her highness' heart inclines to show her mercy, Will you turn back the gentle stream of pity? BURLEIGH. My lord, it suits not with her grace's honour To entertain in personal conference One whom the laws already have condemn'd; To the axe belongs the head of Mary Stuart, And if she may come nigh to the queen's presence, The sentence cannot be fulfill'd: for mercy And pardoning grace flow from the sov'reign's countenance, And whoso looks upon her face must live. ELIZABETH (wiping her tears after reading the letter). O earth! O men! O wretched human fortunes! Where are your roots, prosperity and greatness? Whither is she fallen, this so lofty lady, Whose pride was fed with such high hopes of glory? Call'd to the oldest throne of Christendom, In vain imaginings fed with the dream That she should wear three crowns upon her head. In humble speech, I trow, she sues for one Who dared to assume the royal arms of England, And suffer'd the fawning things about her court To call her sovereign of these British Isles. By Heaven! my lords, it cuts me to the heart, And pity and amazement strive within me, When I behold these shifting tides of chance, And feel the whiff and wind of these blows of fate, Striking a royal head so near my own. SHREWSBURY. Oh, madam! God speaks thus to your heart; incline Your ear to His heavenly teaching. Heavily Hath Mary Stuart atoned her heavy guilt, Reach forth a hand of mercy to her now; Into the darkness of the grave which holds her Descend, and be to her the angel of light. BURLEIGH. Madam, be steadfast, nor allow the smart Of a praiseworthy pity to mislead you; Do not your own hands bind, so that hereafter, That which you would and must, you cannot do. You cannot show her mercyâmay not save her; Then give no room to have it said, that you In scorn and unrelenting hardness went, To look unmoved on her, whom you condemn'd. LEICESTER. My lords, let us confine ourselves within Our measured duties; our most gracious queen Needs not our aid or counsel to determine What worthiest and best is to be done. The meeting of two royal kinswomen Has nought to do with the solemn march of justice. The laws of England, not our mistress' will, Have sentenced Mary Stuart, and 'tis worthy The great and noble spirit of our queen, The gentle impulse of her heart to follow, Even though the law fulfil its stern decrees. ELIZABETH. Leave us, my lords; we shall the method find To join with seemliness what pity urges, And what necessity doth lay upon us. Now leave us. Mortimer, a word with you. [Exeunt all but Elizabeth and Mortimer. ELIZABETH (after observing him keenly for some moments). You have shown a daring spirit, and for your years A most unwonted power of self-command. Who the hard science of dissimulation So early learns to use, is ripe betimes, And o'erleaps years of life's apprenticeship. Fate beckons you to an exalted pathâ I prophesy it; and for your better fortune I can myself fulfil the prophecy. MORTIMER. Exalted sovereign! all I have, and am, Is to your service utterly devoted. ELIZABETH. You have learnt to know the enemies of England, Their hate irreconcilable towards me, Their inexhaustible bloody plots against me. Thus far th'Almighty has protected me, But still the crown must totter on my brows, While she yet lives from whom their fanatic zeal Borrows at once its hope and its pretext. MORTIMER. She lives no longer when you so decree it. ELIZABETH. Ah, sir! I thought that I had reach'd the goal, But find myself no nearer than at first. I thought to have let the law deal with her, And keep mine own hands free from blood the while. The sentence is pronounced; what have I gain'd While it is not fulfill'd? and my command Alone fulfils it, Mortimer. And I Must meet the odium of the deed, and cannot By any means escape the ill-seeming act. Thatâthat is worst of all! MORTIMER. What matters it How evil may appear that which is right? ELIZABETH. You do not know the world; each man is judge Of what each man appears; no one is judge What any truly is. I can convince None of my right; the more must I take heed That my share in her death be kept close secret. Double-faced deeds require the screen of darkness; The perilous step is that which we acknowledge; And nothing's lost but that which we surrender. MORTIMER (significantly). Then, had it better beenâ? ELIZABETH (quickly). Better? ay, best! Proceed, fulfil, and bring it to an endâ You are rightly earnestâin the right direction. Another sort of man are you from your uncle! MORTIMER. Did you reveal to him your wishes, madam? ELIZABETH. I did so; and I rue it. MORTIMER. Pardon him! The old man's weight of years has made him cautious; Such venturous deeds require the bolder spirit Of youth. ELIZABETH. May I dare trust you? MORTIMER. To your deed I'll lend my hand. See you to your own fair name. ELIZABETH. That will I, when the day shall dawn that brings you To greet me with the welcome words, âThis night Is Mary Stuart, thy deadliest enemy, dead.â MORTIMER. Madam, depend on me. ELIZABETH. But whenâwhen shall I Lay down my head securely and in peace? MORTIMER. The next new moon shall see your fears all ended. ELIZABETH. Be cautious, sir; and let it nothing irk you, That I must hide my gratitude to you Under the veil of darkness. Silence ever Is guardian god of happiness; and bonds Sweetest and closest are by mystery tied. [Exit Elizabeth. MORTIMER. Go, get thee from me, false dissembling queen! I cheat thee, even as thou cheat'st the world; And to betray thee is a righteous deed. Bear I a murderer's visage? didst thou read Upon my forehead custom of fell deeds? Yea, trust my arm! do but hold back thine own; Assume the lovely glamour shape of mercy To the world's gaze, whilst thou in secret reckon'st Upon my murderous help; so shall we win A blessed respite for deliverance. Thou wilt exalt me! and from far didst point To some high guerdon, offer'd to my hope; Nay, but wert thou the prizeâthou, and thy favour, What were such prize to me?âwhat canst thou give? No idle vanity seduces me. Near her alone life's aspect wears a charm; Round her for ever hovers the divinity Of grace, and loveliness, and youthful joy; The bliss of heaven blooms upon her breast, And dead and wither'd are thy proffer'd gifts. Highest of earthly joys that earth can grant, Is where one heart, enchanting and enchanted, In self-oblivious ecstasy bestows itself Upon another heart. A woman's crown Was never thine, for thou didst never yet, Loving thyself, give rapture to a lover! I must seek out Lord Leicester, and deliver Her letter to him; 'tis a hateful task; I bear the shining courtier small good will. I can alone deliver her; and mine Be danger, glory, and the precious prize! [Enter Paulet. PAULET. What said the queen to thee? MORTIMER. Nothing; that isâ Nothing of any moment. PAULET. Hear me, Mortimer; The ground on which thou tread'st is slippery smooth; And princes' favours have a beckoning aspect To youth athirst for honour and for fame. Let not ambition lead thy feet astray. MORTIMER. Was't not yourself who brought me to the Court? PAULET. Well wish I that I had not done so. Not At Court was the honour of our house built up. Nephew, stand steadfast! purchase not too dear; Wound not thy conscience. MORTIMER. Uncle! why, how nowâ What means this sudden apprehension? PAULET. Heed not the queen's fair promises of greatness; Trust not her flattering words. She'll disavow thee When thou hast obey'd her; and to wash The stain from her own name, she will avenge The bloody deed that she herself commanded. MORTIMER. The bloody deed! PAULET. Away with thy dissembling! I know that which the queen demanded of thee. She hopes thy youth, greedy for self-advancement, Will prove more pliant than my stiffer age. Sayâhast thou promised? hast thouâsay? MORTIMER. Why, uncleâ PAULET. And if thou hast, I curse and cast thee off! [Enter the Earl of Leicester. LEICESTER. One word with your nephew, worthiest sir, allow me; The queen is graciously inclined to favour him, And wills the person of the Lady Stuart Shall be entrusted solely to his keeping. On his uprightness she depends implicitly. PAULET. Does she so?âgood! LEICESTER. What say you, sir? PAULET. The queen Depends on him, it seems; and I, my lord, Will on myself depend, and trust my eyes. [Exit Paulet. LEICESTER (astonished). What ails your worthy uncle? MORTIMER. Nay, I know not; Perchance this unexpected trust of the queenâ LEICESTER (observing him attentively). And are you, sir, one to be safely trusted? MORTIMER. I might reply in your own words, my lord. LEICESTER. You've something to impart to me in secret, then? MORTIMER. First give me some assurance that I may. LEICESTER. And who for you shall give me like security? Pray do not take my slight distrust amiss; Here in this court I see you wear two faces; One is of course a maskâbut which is not? MORTIMER. Even so my lord of Leicester seems to me. LEICESTER. Which of us two shall trust the other first? MORTIMER. He that has least to venture. LEICESTER. Then, speak you! MORTIMER. Rather, speak you my lord! your testimony, You, the all-powerful, all-favour'd noble, May fell me to the earth, mine could do nothing Against your lofty station and great favour. LEICESTER. Sir, you're deceived: in all respects but one, I am powerful here; but on that tender point, Which I must now deliver to your faith, I am in all this court the least secure, And who is treacherous to me there can ruin me. MORTIMER. From you to me, Lord Leicester, such avowal Exalts me from my humbler state so far, That I may venture to assume more honour, And give you a magnanimous example. LEICESTER. So do; I'll follow without faltering. MORTIMER (hastily drawing forth the letter). The Queen of Scotland sends you this, my lord! LEICESTER (eagerly and apprehensively seizing it). For God's love, sir, speak low! What do I see! Ah, 'tis her image! [He kisses the picture and remains gazing at it. MORTIMER (observing him searchingly while he reads). I believe in you, my lord. LEICESTER (after rapidly reading). Are the contents of this known to you, sir? MORTIMER. No, I know nothing. LEICESTER. Ha! yet she has doubtless Trustedâ MORTIMER. Nothing; she said you'd solve the riddle Of this strange mystery, therefore give me leave To speak th'unfeign'd amazement of my mind, That you, her open foe, her persecutor, One of her judges, and Elizabeth's favourite, Are he from whom the queen looks for deliverance! And yet it must be so, for your eyes speak Clearly enough what your heart feels for her. LEICESTER. First let me know whence comes the fiery zeal You spend upon her cause? and by what means You have deserved the confidence she shows you? MORTIMER. For that few words suffice. I changed my faith At Rome, and to the House of Guise swore fealty, And a letter from the Archbishop of Rheims Commended my poor service to the queen. LEICESTER. I knew of this conversion of your faith, It first invited me to trust in you; Give me your hand, and pardon my suspicion! Too cautious can I hardly be, for Walsingham And Burleigh hate me, and I know their nets Are stretch'd for me; you might have been Their instrument or creature to decoy me to them. MORTIMER. What, are the courtly gyves so strait, the bonds So narrow that Lord Leicester's steps are shackled? My lord, I pity you! LEICESTER. Joyfully then, I cast myself upon your friendly breast, And throw aside the long-oppressing burden. You are amazed, sir, at the sudden change In the feelings I profess towards Mary Stuart; But I was never her real enemy, Though the strong current of events opposed me to her. Destin'd to me long years before, to Darnley They gave her handâthen, with a throne for dower I would not wed herânow, in captivity, Even to the gates of death I seek and claim her. MORTIMER. Why it is nobly done!â LEICESTER. The times are alter'dâ Then vainly did the crown of Scotland beckon me, And with it the youth and beauty that adorn'd it, For in my ambition's eager grasp I thought To clutch a greater prizeâthe crown of England. MORTIMER. It is well known you were preferred to all. LEICESTER. It seem'd so, sir; yet now, after ten years Of creeping, cringing, crouching, crawling slavery, Base years! for ever wastedâoh, my heart Will to my lips heave up its bitterness! Yea, doubtless, all men count me fortunate. Oh, if they knew the galling weight of the chains They envy me! Daily, for ten long years, Have I my life to this vain idol offer'd, Each hourly change of fierce despotic humour Bent, bow'd, and turn'd me toâthe wretched play-thing Of each fantastic whim, of wayward wantonness, Fondled and fool'd with short-lived tenderness, Thrust back with cold and insolent disdain, Tormented by her passion or her pride, The close-watch'd prisoner of her lynx-eyed jealousy, School'd like a boy, and chidden like a groom; Words have no utterance for this ten years' hell! MORTIMER. I pity you, my lord! LEICESTER. And now the prize, E'en as I touch the goal escapes my graspâ Another comes and reaps my hard-earn'd harvest, A blooming boy-consort seizes my right, And I must now come down from the lofty stage Where for so long I shone i' the foremost place; For I shall lose her favour with her handâ Of that the new comer will rob me too,â He is a proper loverâshe's a woman! MORTIMER. Katherine de Medici's son in a good school Has learnt the art of wily flattery. LEICESTER. So fall my hopes! but in this wreck I seek The plank of rescue that shall save my fortunes; Towards my fair early hopes I turn mine eyes, And Mary's image in her beauty's splendour Rises before me: grace and loveliness Again assert their rightâno cold ambitionâ But my heart's sentence of comparison Points to the jewel I had cast away. With horror I behold the misery In which she's plungedâplunged even by my guilt, And once again the hope awakes in me, That I may yet both rescue and possess her. Through some trustworthy hand it now behoves me To lay before her eyes my alter'd heart. And in this letter you have brought I read That she forgives, and will bestow herselfâ Fair prize!âupon me, if I rescue her. MORTIMER. Meantime what have you done to rescue her? You have allowed her trial to proceed, And given your own voice to her final sentence; A miracle must happenâthe light of truth Must be reveal'd suddenly to meâ To me, the kinsman of her prison keeper, From Romeâfrom the chambers of the Vaticanâ Must heaven summon her deliverer, Or never had deliverance come nigh her LEICESTER. Anguish enough, good sir, her fate has cost me! From Talbot's Castle brought to Fotheringay, She was transferr'd to your uncle's vigilant guard, And all approach to her barr'd and impossible; Still was I fain in the world's eyes to seem The enemy and persecutorâyet never Believe that I had suffer'd her to perish: I hopedâI hopeâto snatch her yet from death, The final thrust of this dark doom to parry, Until some means are found to snatch her from it. MORTIMER. Then they are foundâLord Leicester, to your trust I answer with like faithâthe means are found For the queen's rescue,âtherefore am I here; All is prepared, all thought for, all begun, And your great name ensures a happy ending. LEICESTER. Death and dismay! what is't you say? my name! MORTIMER. By open force will I unbar her prison, And those whose hands are eager for the task, Banded with meâ LEICESTER. Confusionâa conspiracy! In what a net art thou entangling me? What, do thy followers possess my secret? MORTIMER. Oh, set your heart at rest, my lord, our plan Had been well knit, and you ne'er laid a finger to it, But that the queen, forsooth, would owe her life To none but you. LEICESTER. In your secret conference My name has ne'er been utter'd?âswear it. MORTIMER. Never! How cautious is my Lord of Leicester grownâ How cold, to one that brings his best hopes help! What! is it you would save the queen and wed her, And when her faithful servants spring to meet you, And Heaven fits instruments to your very hand, You show far more confusion and dismay Than joy? LEICESTER. Noânot by open forceâby violence; This suddenness is dangerousâ MORTIMER. Delay Is dangerous too. LEICESTER. Sirâsirâit cannot be; 'Tis not to be thought on. MORTIMER (bitterly). Not by you, my lord, Who love and would possess the queen; but we, Who only seek to set her free, may venture it. LEICESTER. Young man, you are too rash to find a way Through such a thick set path of perilous thorns. MORTIMER. And you in the road of honourâmost considerate. LEICESTER. I see the snares by which we are beset. MORTIMER. I feel the strength to break my way through them. LEICESTER. Foolhardiness and madness is such courage! MORTIMER. And a weak prudence hardly valour, lord. LEICESTER. Hast thou a mind to die the death of Babington? MORTIMER. You have no mind to rival Norfolk's glory. LEICESTER. Norfolk embraced the bloody axeânot Mary. MORTIMER. He show'd the world that he was worthy of her. LEICESTER. If we should fail, we drag her down with us. MORTIMER. Hugging our safety will not conquer hers. LEICESTER. Nay, but you hear notâyou consider notâ And will, in blind impatience, overthrow What was e'en now so fairly on the way. MORTIMER. So fairly on the wayâby you made ready? But say, what have you done to rescue her? Say rather, what, had I been fool enough To murder her, as e'en now Elizabeth bade me, (And at this very hour believes 'tis done), Speak! say, what had you done to save her life? LEICESTER (amazed). The queen gave you that bloody order? MORTIMER. Yes, sirâ Elizabeth's as much deceived in me As Mary is in youâthey both are cheated. LEICESTER. So then, you promised her compliance, did you then? MORTIMER. Lest she should borrow other hands, I offer'd To lend her mine. LEICESTER. Why, that was wisely done; That gives us space and room to move; relying Upon a bloody secret service, she Will let the sentence unfulfill'd remain, Meanwhile we are gaining time. MORTIMER (impatiently). No, we are losing it! LEICESTER. She reckons upon you, and all the less Will scruple to assume the mask of mercy; Perhaps by courtier-craft I may persuade her Her rival's countenance once to behold, And such a step must bind her hands for ever; Burleigh is right, if once they meet, the sentence Can never be fulfill'd. It shall be so; I'll venture all to bring them face to face. MORTIMER. And then what have you gain'd when she beholds Her hopes in me deceived? If Mary lives Shall not all things remain as they are now? Will she be free? Never! her mildest fate Must be but this life-long captivity. In Heaven's name! do you not see an act Of daring must at last be her redemption? Choose, then, at first, the noblest way to win her. You have the power, a host starts at your call, Of your own followers and retainers only; Mary has many secret, faithful friends; The noble house of Howard, and of Percy, Have heroes ready still to die for her, Did but a powerful hand uplift her standard. Away with cunning! open be the warfare! Like a true knight set lance in rest for your love, And fight one loyal fight to win your lady; Why, if your will were set to a deed of daring, Elizabeth's person might you well surprise; Not seldom to your castles and your mansions She has deign'd to come a guest, let her remain A prisoner for awhile, then play the man; Speak, for she then must hear, nor set her free Till Mary's freedom you have won from her. LEICESTER. Amazement! horror! whither does madness urge thee! Know'st thou the earth that thou art standing on? Deemest thou what 'tis to breathe here in this court? And the tremendous spell this woman's rule Has thrown o'er all men's faculties? would'st seek For the free spirit that once lived in the land? It is lock'd up, the key at a woman's girdle, And every wing of noble daring fetter'd. Follow my warningânothing venture rashly. Some one draws near; leave me. MORTIMER. And Mary hopes! Is this the empty comfort I must bear to her? LEICESTER. Bear her my vow of everlasting love! MORTIMER. Bear it yourself! instrument of her rescue I hither cameânot your love messenger. [Exit Mortimer. [Enter Elizabeth. ELIZABETH. Who parted from you there? sure I heard voices. LEICESTER (with sudden alarm and confusion). 'Twas Mortimer. ELIZABETH. How now, my lord, what ails you? You're all amazed! LEICESTER (commanding himself). Oh, well may I be so By the dazzling splendour of your loveliness! Never more beauteous did these eyes behold you. Ah!â ELIZABETH. Wherefore do you sigh? LEICESTER. I have cause, Madam, for no rare merriment methinks, When, looking on the beauty that enslaves me, I am reminded of my grievous loss. ELIZABETH. Thy loss? LEICESTER. You have I lost, your precious self; Soon in the arms of a youthful bridegroom, you Shall forget all, but your own full content, And he shall have your undivided heart. He is of royal raceâso am not Iâ And yet bear witness, Heaven! if this earth's round Holds one that worships you as I do! He, The Duke of Anjou, never has beheld you; Your fame, your pow'r, your greatness, he may love; Alas! but I love you; had you been born A shepherd lass, and I the king o' the earth, From my great height I had come down to you, And laid my crown beneath your feet. ELIZABETH. Ah, Dudley! Blame me notâpity meâI dare not question My heart, its answer do I know by heart: Oh! how I envy those more fortunate women Who may make great the men they love. I may not Divide my throne with him who owns my heart; Yet Mary Stuart mightâshe was so happyâ Her heart went with her hand, she crown'd her husband, And mingling love and power in one deep draught Of perfect joy, she drank her fill. LEICESTER. And now She drinks the dregs of sorrow drop by drop. ELIZABETH. She heeded not men's judgments, she; to her, Light was the burthen of her light life; never Did she bow down her neck to the heavy yoke That I have stoop'd to; I, too, might have seized Days full of happiness, and nights of pleasure, But rather chose the kingly servitude, And royal task of righteous government; But ev'n for that, because she never strove To be more than a woman, she has now All men to be her lovers and her servants, And leads in willing thraldom old and young: Such are ye men! wantons, I trow, at heart, Wantonness only is your proper lure, And to 't ye fly, where'er it beckons you, Nor ever love what will be honour'd too. Did not old greybeard Talbot glow to a flame While talking of her loveliness, forsooth? LEICESTER. Poor gentleman! he was her keeper once. She hath bewitch'd him with her honey'd speech. ELIZABETH. Can it be true that she is still so fair? I'm weary hearing of this goodly favour, And could be well content to trust my eyes, Rather than lying pictures and reports In this weighty matter; why dost look at me So earnestly? LEICESTER. Methought I saw you standing Beside the Queen of Scots. I would I might Behold you so indeed! for then, dear mistress, Should you a woman's proper victory know. With envious eyes, and envy's eyes are keen, I saw her running o'er the fair assemblage Of your good graces, which should show to her Beauty's own image fitly framed in virtue. ELIZABETH. She is the younger of the two. LEICESTER. Indeed! No one would think it; but her sorrows doubtless Have aged her looks something before the time. It might, indeed, be doubly bitter to her Now, as a bride, first to encounter you; The joys of life are far behind her fled, While you behold them towards yourself advancing; The bride, too, of the King of France's sonâ Of France, upon whose kindred and assistance She has so proudly and securely reckon'd. ELIZABETH. I'm much besought to visit her. LEICESTER. As grace She prays it, let it be her punishment; True, you can send her to the bloody block, But not the axe shall give so sharp a stroke To her body, as your aspect to her soul; As seeing her own light put out by yours, As is each petty paling star by the sun. Thus shall you pay her back those stabs she sought To give youâand do keener execution On her than could the headsmanâshowing her The triumph of your loveliness and glory, With reverence crown'd, as well as pow'r, and greatness; Clothed and embellish'd by that spotless fame Which she did wantonly strip off and cast from her; The splendour of your crown, and love's soft radiance, Making a brightness round you. When she thus Beholds youâthen, that is her hour of doom! And why not even now? for in this hour, Arm'd as for victory I see you stand, And saw you ne'er more fair! This very hourâ ELIZABETH. This very hour!ânow! No, no, Leicester, this Must be well thought on; I must speak with Burleigh. LEICESTER. Burleigh knows nought but reasons of the state! Unto your womanhood some rights belong, And to judge in this matter is your right. And reasons of the state approve it too; The common voice shall cry well done to it, That you with pity visit your deadly foe, Howe'er the law shall deal with her hereafter. ELIZABETH. Natheless methinks it were not well to see My kinswoman brought to such low estate; 'Tis said, indeed, I know, she lives not royally, And scarcely may receive a royal visit With honour to us both. LEICESTER. Over the threshold Of her prison you need not step; but hear my counselâ Chance serves us to a wish; the hunt to-day Leads towards the neighbourhood of Fotheringay. Let Mary Stuart have leave to walk abroad, And in the park, what hinders that you meet her, When none shall think the act premeditate? Nay, if your majesty deign'd not to speakâ ELIZABETH. Servant, if this approve itself a folly, Thine be the blame, not mine! To-day, No wish of thine will I gainsayâI owe thee Some compensation for this French betrothal; Be it as thou hast said. Liking weighs not Each several grace it grants, else 'twere no liking; So, my good Leicester, we'll towards Fotheringay. [Leicester throws himself at her feet; the curtain falls. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene 1. A park outside of Fotheringay Castle; a distant prospect. Enter hastily Mary; Kennedy following her. KENNEDY. Whither so fast, madam? You almost run; I'm cramp'd with age and lack of exercise; You fly, my old joints ache to follow you MARY. Over the greensward, oh, let my feet stray, Light wing'd with joy as in childhood's bright day; Cast off thy age as I wipe off my tears. Have I come forth from that prison of years? Has the dark vault yielded up its sad prey? Do I once more greet the splendour of day? Oh, let me, 'scaped from that den of despair, Drink in long draughts the free heavenly air. KENNEDY. O my beloved mistressâout, alas! Your prison bounds are but a little widen'd; You do not see the walls that shut you in Because the green boughs hide them. MARY. Bless them! Oh, bless them that they hide my prison from me! Let me dream out my dream of joy, dear Kennedy! Bid me not wake to weepâI've wept so long! Above my head the boundless heavens bend smiling, My eyes roam far, far o'er the distant prospect! See there! there, yonder! where the misty mountains Melt in the hazy sky! Beyond lies Scotlandâ My land, my home, my kingdom! Look! the clouds Are hastening to the south, across the sea They go towards France! look! look! they go towards France! Fast sailing vapours, ye ships of the air, Whom are ye steer'd by?âwho do ye bear? Ah, greet for me the sweet home of my youthâ Straight bound in fetters, a pris'ner I lieâ Be ye my envoys, bright clouds of the sky! Free through the free air ye wing your swift way, England's proud queen over you holds no sway. KENNEDY. Madam! good madam!âfinding suddenly Her long lost freedom, she has lost herself! MARY. See on the beach rocks the fisherman's boat! Oh! on that poor wretched skiff could I float Far from these shores to a friendlier strand; Hardly it yields to its owner's hard hand Bread, with sore toilâI would heap it with gold, Once should his nets gather treasure untold, Might but his boat bear me off from this land! KENNEDY. Wild hopeless vision! see you not from far That we are watch'd and follow'd? instant ruin Glares on each thing that would show pity to us, And scares it from our path. MARY. No, no, good Hannah! Trust me, my prison bars have not in vain Open'd themselves at last to let me forth. This favour shown me is the gracious harbinger Of justice and of right. It is no mockery; I know the dear and powerful hand that thus Gently is drawing me from out my dungeon; I know it is the might of love, and Leicester, That loosens thus my bitter prison cords; They will be slacken'd day by day, until In a blessed hour they fall away from me, And I shall be free! KENNEDY. And yet I cannot Make match these contradictions! Yesterday, Death was announced to you, death close at hand; 'Tis true, indeed, their shackles are struck off, Who stand on the threshold of eternal freedom. [Horns in the forest. MARY. Hear'st thou the hunter's horn? hear'st thou it ringing Cheerily sounding through forest and fell? Oh, on my good horse once more to be springing Far, far away, over mountain and dell! Oh! what a doleful echo doth it wake, That merry music! On the hills of Scotland, Over the golden gorse and purple heather, The live-long day how I have followed it! [Enter Paulet. PAULET. Now, Madam! will you say at last, âWell done,â And give me once your thanks? MARY. How, sir?âwhat mean you? Is it to you I owe this hour of life?â To you? PAULET. I do believe so; to the queen I gave your letter. MARY. You did give it her To her own handâindeedâand this great boon Was thus won for me? PAULET. Nor this boon alone, Be you prepared to welcome a yet greater. MARY. A greater boon!âwhat may this mean? PAULET. Do you hear The hunters' horns in the forest? MARY. Sir, you fright me. PAULET. The queen is hunting there, and presently Comes hither. [Mary falls in the arms of Kennedy. KENNEDY. Madam, why, how now, dearest lady? You are all pale and cold. PAULET. What not content! Falls it not right at lastâwas't not your suit? Is't not more quickly granted than you hoped for? Till now you never lack'd persuasive words. Do you stand speechless?ânow is the very hour To speak, and to good purpose. MARY. Why was I not Forewarn'dâprepared? Not nowâI cannotânoâ I'm lost! I am not mistress of myselfâ That which as highest mercy I implored Fills me with sudden terror and amazement. Lead me hence, Hannahâmy distracted sense Let me collect. PAULET. Nay, madam, you must wait Her highness hereâyet, can I well believe The sight of your judge appals you. [Enter Shrewsbury. MARY. Not so, sirâ O noble Shrewsbury!âgood friendâyou're come Like Heaven's own angel to my utmost need! I cannot see herâsave meâsave me from Her hated aspectâ SHREWSBURY. I beseech your grace Come to yourself;âcourage, good madamâcourage For 'tis the very hour of fate for you. MARY. Oh, I have long'd for itâyearn'dâhunger'd for itâ And wearied God with prayers to bring it on; For years conn'd o'er my task of humble sueing; In my long prison nights, said, o'er and o'er, Each sad and moving plea, wherewith I thought To touch her heartâit's gone!âit's all forgotten! Words of entreatyâtears of supplication, All goneâI can remember nothing,ânothing But the burning smart of my great injuries! My heart swells in my breast full of fierce hateâ Of bloody hateâall gentle thoughts forsake me, And rattling their snaky hair, the furies of hell Stand round me, yelling frenzy in my ears! SHREWSBURY. Madam, for the love of God beat down the rash Temptation of your agony! Let not the gall That chokes you, rise to your tongue;ânay, but be patient; What good can come of it when hate meets hate. Wrestle, good madam, with your bitterness. Remember all that hangs on this one hour, Think of her power, dear queen! and bow yourself. MARY. Before herânever!â SHREWSBURY. Do itâyea, do it, madam! Speak to her gently, with self-government; Be great in patience, and forget your wrongs Forget your rights too,âthis is not the hour, When they may safely be remember'd by you. MARY. I have pull'd down my ruin on my own head: God curses me with granting of my prayer. No, we should never meet each other's eyes; No good can come of itâbut dire misfortune. Water and fire shall lovingly compound, And wolves and lambs feed friendly side by side, Ere we can meet in peace; too deep the wound Has fester'd in my breast,âtoo heavily Her iron hand has ground me down. No, never Can a true reconcilement grow between us. SHREWSBURY. Yet stay, and look upon her countenanceâ I saw her when from reading of your letter She raised her eyes, and they were full of tears; She is not flinty-hearted. Good your grace! Yourself had gentler thoughts when you writ to her. That you should dress your speech in kindness, And meet her sisterly, I have hurried hither To warn you of her coming. MARY. Excellent Talbot! You ever were my friend. Oh, had I ne'er Been ta'en away from your houseâO Shrewsbury! My heart and soul quail with dismayâ SHREWSBURY. Forgetâ Look not behindâfasten your thoughts alone On the blest hope this hour may win for you. MARY. Comes Burleigh, tooâmy evil angel, with her? SHREWSBURY. None comes but the Earl of Leicester with the queen. MARY. Lord Leicester! SHREWSBURY. Nothing need you fear from him. He wills no evil to youâ'tis his deed Her highness hath consented to this meeting. MARY. Oh, I was sure of it! SHREWSBURY. What say you, madam? PAULET. The queen [All withdraw on one side, except Mary, who remains leaning on Kennedy. Enter Elizabeth and Leicester followed by her train. ELIZABETH. What place is this? LEICESTER. Fotheringay Castle. ELIZABETH (to SHREWSBURY). Send on our train towards London, sir; the throng Chokes all the roads and clamours at our heels. We'll breathe awhile here, in this leafy stillness. [Talbot dismisses the train. Elizabeth fixes her eyes on Mary, and continues speaking to Paulet. This is too much; our good folk love us well, But lack some measure in their show of love. So men should worship God, not earthly kings; And such a loyalty smacks of idolatry. MARY (who has continued leaning on Kennedy, raises herself, and turning, her eyes encounter the gaze Elizabeth fastens on her: she shudders, and throws herself back on Kennedy). O God! no heart looks from those horny eyes. ELIZABETH. Who is that woman? LEICESTER. May it please your majesty, This place is Fotheringay. ELIZABETH. Ha! who has dared Do this? LEICESTER. By Heaven, madam, are you led hither; And now, let pity have its perfect work. SHREWSBURY. Oh, royal lady, be compassionate! With mercy look on the unfortunate, Sinking beneath the terrors of your aspect. ELIZABETH. Why, how is this, my lords? ye prate to us Of one bow'd down in lowliness and sorrow, But we can see nought save a haughty dame, Whose pride defies sorrow and us. MARY. It must be; To this humility will I constrain myselfâ Bow down, proud head; bend, stubborn knees, to the dust; And thou my throbbing heart, forgetâforget. [She kneels. Heaven sides with you, my sister; in your fortune, I honour its inscrutable decrees; To your prosperity I bow my misery, And worship in your power the Power that made it. But now, be merciful as you are great! Queen, suffer not your hapless kinswoman To stoop her forehead to the dust in vain: O sister, reach to me your hand, and raise me. ELIZABETH. Heaven judges justly, and has righteously Assign'd to each of us our rightful place; And I may thank its mercy, and not yours, That I am not laid lower even than you. MARY. Oh, yet bethink yourself, how change supreme Rules all the destinies of human fortunes! God takes delight in humbleness, not pride. Fear Him, that King of the kings of the earth, Who casts me prostrate underneath your feet. For the sake of those who gaze upon us, honour Yourself in honouring me, and do not shame The royal blood of Tudor in both our veins:â O God of heaven! stand not stony thus, Like to the inaccessible crag, that throws The drowning wretch that clasps it back again To the devouring sea; my hope, my fate, My life, hangs on my might of prayers and tears; Loose the hard gripe with which you've seized my heart, Or how can I touch yours! Your icy look Freezes my senses up; my tears congeal; My words can find no voice for this cold terror. ELIZABETH. What would you say? You have urged speech with me, And I forget my state and your devices, And come to hear you pleadâyea, sisterly, To grant the comfort of my sight to you. Nought have I hearken'd to but the kind counsel Of pity; and some blame, moreover, bear I, That I in this too much demean myself, And run, perhaps, some dangerâfor my life Has not been always safe, for your good will. MARY. How shall I speak? wherewith shall I begin? What words shall I choose to soothe and not offend you? Give me, my God! persuading speech, and blunt The edge of every sharp, impatient thought, That she may feel no touch save that of pity! And yetâand yetâhow can I clear myself And not blame you? It is impossible! For you have evil dealt with meâindeed You have. Am I not even as you a queen? And you have made a wretched prisoner of me. I came a suppliant to you, and against The holy human law of hospitality, And general law of nations, you have kept me Lock'd in a dungeon; all my friends, my servants, Have I been cruelly divided from; Unworthy niggard stint have I endured In my daily lifeâbefore a base tribunal Have I been dragg'dâEnough! henceforth for ever, Let thick forgetfulness hide all I've suffer'd! Nay, fate has been to blame, not you, or I; Some evil spirit, from the dark depths of hell, Has had Heaven's leave to sow this hate between us, And even from our youth set us at discord; The bitter root grew with our growth, and men Like devils, fit to work with devils, fann'd The evil flame with breath accursed; the madness Of bigot zeal thrust weapons into hands Unknown to each of us, against the other; For 'tis the curse of kings, that their disunion Divides the world, and in a thousand hearts Their hate begets more hate. But all is over! No strangeness hides us from each other now, We look into each other's eyes at last; Now, speak, good sister! tell me all my faults, And I will give you ample satisfaction: Oh, wherefore, long agoâlong, long agoâ Did you not grant my earnest prayer to see you? It had ne'er come to thisânever had we had A meeting such as this, in such a place. ELIZABETH. My better angel kept me from the danger Of taking to my breast the frozen viper; Blame fate for nothing! blame the bitter grudge You've ever borne meâyour house's mad ambition, Which enviously hath still waged war against meâ That insolent priest, your uncle's lust of power, Whose bold hands have been stretch'd towards every crown, That he might hope to graspâhe 'twas that fool'd you To the pitch of daring to assume my arms And style, crazy defiance casting in my teeth. Whom hath he not made his allies against me? The voice of the pulpit, and the people's arm, The death-devoted knife of frantic ecstasy; Here in my very kingdom, freedom's seat and dwelling-place, Hath he blown up the fierce flame of sedition. But God is on my side! the haughty priest Hath not prevail'dâanother aim, I trow, He reaches, than the one he reckon'd on; He struck at my head, but he has struck yours. MARY. God's will be done! but yet, I do believe You will not mark so bloodily your victory. ELIZABETH. And wherefore shall I not? and who shall hinder me? Your uncle hath a good example given, To all the kings of the earth, how foes are dealt with; His hallowing of St. Bartholomew's day Is a rare lessonâyea, and I will follow it. What tell you me of kindred, and of rights, Relationship of blood, or bond of kingship? Go toâgo toâyour Church can loose all ties, And perjury or regicide make holy; I will but practise what your priests do preach. Say rather, if I were to set you free, With what lock shall I fasten up your faith, That may not by St. Peter's keys be open'd? That I do hold youâthat, is my only safety; What compact shall be made with the serpent's seed? MARY. This has been still your bitter policy; As foe and stranger have you always dealt with me. Had you, according to my right, proclaim'd me, Your next successor, you had found in me A loving, faithful friend, and kinswoman. ELIZABETH. Treachery is your friendshipâthe Pope of Rome Is your only father, and his priests your brothers; These are your kinsfolk. Yea, forsooth, Proclaim you my successor! while I yet live, Give o'er my people to your damnable creed, And see the noble youth of my realm all snared By the crafty sorceries of a new Armida; Direct th'expecting gaze of my whole kingdom To the rising sun, while Iâ MARY. Reign, reign in peace! All claim to your succession I forego; My spirit's wings are lame and shatter'dânever Towards any noble aim shall they soar again; You have your will of meâalas! I am No more but the shadow of poor Mary Stuart! My heart is broken by long prison sorrow. You have done your utmostâin my flow'r of life You have struck me down, and I shall bloom no more. Now, make an end my sister! Speak at last The word you are come to speakâfor I will not think You have come hither but to mock my ruin; Pronounce it royally at once:ââYou're free; My power have you felt, now know my mercy.â Say itâoh, say it! and my life and freedom Even as a boon, I will receive from you! One word can give me bothâI wait for it; Let me not wait too long, or wait in vain. Woe be to you if with that word of mercy, This dreadful conference does not end!âif you Depart not like an angel, leaving blessings, Look you not for the glory of your kingdom; Nay, not for all the kingdoms of the earth Would I be what you then would seem to me. ELIZABETH. So, then! you own yourself at length o'ercome! Are all your practices spent? what, no more murders Hatching? what, not one wild adventurer left To lift his lance in hopeless battle for you? Yea, you have said it, all is over now; And I think well, the world hath other cares, And worthier, than you, or your lost fortunes. I think your means of mischief are worn out; No, no, you will snare no more of my subjects' hearts With your spent spells; nor will you readily find One who shall covet to be your fourth husband, Or your next championâfor you're deadly to them Alike. MARY. God give me patience! sisterâsisterâ ELIZABETH. So these, my Lord of Leicester, are the graces That no man without love might look upon, Or woman without envy!âverily, We know of old the worth of general rumour; But there's some justice in its lying hereâ A liberal life trumpets a comeliness That might have lack'd renown wedded to modesty; A common fame becomes a common beauty. MARY. This is too much!â ELIZABETH. Ah! now we see at last The proper face! before 'twas but a mask. MARY. Beware lest ever yours should fallâbeware! Humanly and in youthful heat I sinn'd, Tempted alike by power and by weakness; 'Tis true, I have not hidden or denied it; No base pretences have I stoop'd to wear To cover what was ill in meâthe worst That can be known of me, the world doth know, And I dare say, I'm better than it counts me. Take heed if ever from your life be stripp'd The goodly cloak of decency that hides The hidden fires of secret lustâtake heed! Your chastity comes not by inheritance, For it is known what virtues led your mother, Anne Bullen, to the block. SHREWSBURY. O Heaven! what wordsâ Is this your humblenessâis this your patience? MARY. Patience! have I not borne what may be borne By mortal flesh and bloodâpatience! away, Away to Heaven long-suffering, meek humility; From thy deep hell come forth, imprison'd hate; And thou, who to the enraged basilisk Hast given its deadly glance, make thou my tongue A poison'd dart, to pierce that stony breast! SHREWSBURY. Oh she is mad! forgive herâheed her notâ Listen not to the ravings of her frenzy. LEICESTER. Hence, madam, hence from this accursed place! MARY. A bastard fills the royal seat of England, And cheats the loyal-hearted English people! Had fate been just, usurper! you had been A suppliant at my feetâand I, your queen. [Exeunt hurriedly Elizabeth, Shrewsbury, and Leicester. KENNEDY. What have you done! oh, miserable princess! She goes in frenzy hence who ne'er forgives. MARY. I have struck home! the venom's in her heart! My tears, my sorrows, my despair, my shame, Her tyranny, her hate, her insolent scorn, The bitterness of yearsâI've heaved it off; The debt of half a life of injuries, I have paid it with a word! oh, let me breathe! KENNEDY. Before her lover's eyes you have debased her. MARY. Before my lover's eyes I've humbled her; His presence lifted me above myself, And as I hurl'd defiance at my rival, Leicester stood by and own'd me for his queen. [Enter Mortimer; he signs to Kennedy, who withdraws: his whole demeanour is wild and reckless. KENNEDY. Oh, sir, here's goodly work! MORTIMER. I heard it all. [Exit Kennedy. Thine is the triumph! in the dust she grovell'd Before thy scathing scornâthine is the victory! Thou art the queenâthe trembling traitor, she. Thy lovely valour hath inflamed my soul. I worship thee! yea, a divinity Art thou to my adoring eyes! MARY. You spake With the Earl of Leicester? to his hand deliver'd My ringâmy letter? Good sir, answer me. MORTIMER. How thy bright dazzling wrath flash'd round thy beauty! Thou art the fairest woman of the whole earth! MARY. Nay, I beseech you satisfy my doubts. What said Lord Leicester?âwhat have I to hope? MORTIMER. Who? he?âthe miserable dastard!âhe? Hope nought from himâdespise him and forget him. MARY. What say you! MORTIMER. He deliverâhe possess thee! Why let him! but for life and death with me Must he struggle first. MARY. Then you gave him my ring? My letter?âall is over. MORTIMER. He would live,â The coward loves his life; who rescues thee And calls thee his, must have the heart to die. MARY. He will not venture for me? MORTIMER. Think not on him! What can he do another may not dare? Alone I'll save theeâIâ MARY. What is't you say? MORTIMER. Cheat not thyself with idle hopes and dreams; To-day it stands no more with thee as yesterday. When the queen parted hence, and your fierce conference Ended, the end of all was come for thee. All 's overâevery gate of mercy barr'd: But deeds may yet avail,âdaring prevail; Who may win all may fairly venture all; Thou shalt be free before to-morrow's dawn. MARY. To-night!âthis very night!âto-night! MORTIMER. Give heed To what we have done: within a secret chapel I have assembled those who've sworn to save thee. A priest took off its burthen from each soul; For our past sins we have had absolution, And for all those this enterprise may cost us; The holy sacrament have we received, And we are ready for the path of death. MARY. Terrible preparation! MORTIMER. This midnight We shall possess the castleâof whose keys I am already master; they who watch thee Shall sleep once and for ever; from thy chamber Myself will bear thee; and that no tongue may tell What any eye beheld, no living soul Shall witness to the morrow of that night. MARY. And DruryâPauletâmy stern prison-keepers? Think you they will not be beforehand with you? MORTIMER. They'll be the first to fall beneath my dagger. MARY. O Heavens, your uncle! MORTIMER. I will murder him. MARY. Oh, bloody horror! MORTIMER. I have absolution Beforehand for all deeds; the worst of horrors No more appals me. MARY. What a savage frenzy! MORTIMER. If the lot to stab Elizabeth falls to me, I'll do it; I have sworn it on the host. MARY. Never for me shall flow such streams of blood! MORTIMER. Whose blood, whose life is anything to me, Weigh'd with thy life, thy love? Nay, let the earth Lurch from its moorings, and a second deluge Sweep all things breathing back into one chaos, Ere I forego my purpose! ere I lose thee Let universal doom seize the whole world! MARY. Merciful Heaven! what words and what a lookâ Terror and shame creep like a palsy o'er me. MORTIMER. Life's but a moment, death is but another. Let me be dragg'd to Tyburn, limb from limb Let their hot pincers tear me,âwhat care I? So first I may but clasp theeâ MARY. Traitorâback! MORTIMER. Upon thy breastâfrom thy love-breathing lipsâ MARY. In the name of Godârelease meâlet me go! MORTIMER. Nay, he is mad who clutches not the bliss Fate gives into his grasp. I'll set thee free; And if it cost a thousand lives, I'll free thee. I've sworn it, and I'll do it; but as God lives If I rescue thee I will possess thee too. MARY. All holy saints and angels saveâdefend me! Terrible destiny! how am I flung From one abyss to another! Was I born To inspire nought but frenzy? Are hate and love Banded alike against me? Sir, have mercyâ MORTIMER. Yea, fiercely as men hate, do I love thee! They'll murder thee, with the sharp shearing axe They'll sever that delicate throat so dazzling white; Oh, give thou to the god of joyâto loveâ What bloody hate will claim for sacrifice! With thy warm beautyâthine no more, but death'sâ Bless, while thou canst, the slave that worships thee: With the shining threads of thy golden, glossy hair, Bind thou in everlasting chains my soul. MARY. Must I hear this, and bear it! Sir, my misery Should make me sacred to you; my great misery, If not my royal blood, should you respect. MORTIMER. The crown is fallen from thy brow; no majesty Of earthly pow'r enshrines thee now; yet speak One royal bidding more, and call me thineâ Thy servantâthy preserver! Nought remains to thee But thy sweet beauty's might of loveliness, That bids me dare and venture all things for itâ That drives me willingly to the foot of the block MARY. Who shall deliver me from my deliverer? MORTIMER. A desperate service claims a desperate meed, Else wherefore doth the hero spill his blood? To live is not the highest joy of life, Yet is he mad that gives his life for nothing. Before I die I'll sleep upon thy heartâ MARY. I must call out for help against this manâ My only friend! MORTIMER. Thou art not cold and hard; The world has never held thee for unyielding. The Italian Rizzio didst thou lift to heaven, And that dark Bothwell clasp'd thee in his arms. MARY. Audacious slave! MORTIMER. He was thy tyrant; fear Ev'n more than love did yield thee up to him; Then, if by terror thou mayst yet be won, By the God of heaven and hellâ MARY. Peace, madman, peace! MORTIMER. Before me shalt thou trembleâ KENNEDY (rushing in). They come! they come! They are at handâarm'd men; the park is full of them! MORTIMER. Oh, fear not; I'll defend thee. MARY. Save me, Hannah! Save me from him! Oh, miserable, whither Shall I turn for refugeâseek for shelter? Insult and violence here, and yonder death. [She faints. Hannah carries her out. Paulet and Drury rush in. Armed men cross the stage hastily. PAULET. Close all the gates, and pull the drawbridge up! MORTIMER. Why, how now, uncle! PAULET. Where is the murderess? Hence with her, down to the deepest dungeon vault. MORTIMER. Speakâsayâwhat has befallen? PAULET. The queen! the queen! Accursed blowâdevilish design! the queen! MORTIMER. The queen! which queen? PAULET. England's Elizabeth; She has been murder'd on the road to London! [He rushes out. MORTIMER. Am I gone mad?âcame there not even now One by me crying out âThe queen is murder'd?â Nay, but I dream; a sudden fever fit Brings that as palpable truth before my senses, With which the swarming thoughts of my soul are full. Who comes?âO'Kelly; his aspect's full of terror. [Enter O'Kelly. O'KELLY. Fly, Mortimer, fly! All's lost! MORTIMER. What's lost? O'KELLY. Be brief In questioning, and think of present means of flight. MORTIMER. Speak, man. O'KELLY. That madman Savage struck the blow. MORTIMER. Then it is true? O'KELLY. True, true, and therefore fly. MORTIMER. She's dead! and Mary mounts the throne of England! O'KELLY. Dead! who has said so? MORTIMER. Thou thyself, this instant. O'KELLY. She lives; and thou, and I, and all of us Are dead! MORTIMER. She lives! O'KELLY. Th'accurs'd knife glanced aside, And Shrewsbury seized it from the wretch's hand. MORTIMER. She lives! O'KELLY. To doom us to ten thousand tortures! Come, come,âthe park's already guarded round. MORTIMER. Who did this goodly work? O'KELLY. The Barnabite From Toulon; he that was with us in the chapel, And lost in thought sat listening, while the priest Read out the anathema, wherewith the pope Had excommunicated England's queen. He thought to find a readier, shorter way, With one bold blow to free the Church from thrall, Or seize the crown of martyrdom himself; To the priest alone he utter'd his design, Which on the London road he meant t'accomplish. MORTIMER (after a long pause). Oh, thou art hunted by a pitiless fate, Thou hapless one!ânow must thou die indeed; For thy own angel has prepared thy ruin. O'KELLY. Say, whither wilt thou fly? To Scotland I; To the heather hills and black pine woods for refuge. MORTIMER. Fly, and may God be with thee in thy flight! I stayâsomething may yet be tried to save her, If not, I can lie down and die upon her bier. [Exeunt. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene 1. A room in the Palace, London. Enter, meeting, Count d'Aubespine, Kent, and Leicester. D'AUBESPINE. How fares her gracious majesty? My lords, You see me fill'd with terror and dismay. How fell this out? What! in the very midst Of her loving subjects! LEICESTER. Ay, sir, but it fell out Through a subject of your king's. The ruffian's French. D'AUBESPINE. Some wretched madmanâ KENT. No, my lord, no madman; But a papist. [Enter Burleigh, speaking to Davison. BURLEIGH. Let the sentence be forthwith Produced; the seal appended. When 'tis ready, Let it be brought for the queen's signature. Goâlose no time. DAVISON. It shall be done, my lord. [Exit Davison. D'AUBESPINE (going towards BURLEIGH). My lord, with the truest heart of loyal friendship, I share the joy of your whole land; and praise The Heavens that have parried the foul blow And saved that sacred head. BURLEIGH. We praise Heaven, sir, That it has brought our treacherous foes to shame. D'AUBESPINE. God's curse alight upon the caitiff murderer! BURLEIGH. Yea, on the murderer and the deviser too. D'AUBESPINE. My Lord High Marshal, may I be bold to crave That you'll conduct me to her majesty? That at her royal feet I lay my duty, And my lord and master's hearty gratulations. BURLEIGH. Oh, my good lord, you may spare yourself the pains. D'AUBESPINE. Sir, I do know the privilege of my duty. BURLEIGH. It shall be well, that, at your speediest, You carry it out of England. D'AUBESPINE. How shall I Understand you, sir? BURLEIGH. Briefly, my lord. Your office Shields you to-day; to-day you are inviolate, For your high office's sake, but not to-morrow. D'AUBESPINE. The right of a French ambassador, my lordâ BURLEIGH. Will not excuse high treason, sir. KENT AND LEICESTER. How now! D'AUBESPINE. Lord Burleigh, have a careâ BURLEIGH. Count d'Aubespine, a pass, Sign'd by your hand, was found upon the murderer. KENT. Is't possible! D'AUBESPINE. That may be trueâwhat then? I do not know the hearts and thoughts of those For whom I daily sign a hundred passes. BURLEIGH. The villain ate at your house. D'AUBESPINE. My house is openâ BURLEIGH. To all the enemies of England. D'AUBESPINE. I demand Enquiry into this matter. BURLEIGH. Sir, believe me 'Twere best you let it pass. D'AUBESPINE. Not so; in me The faith of my royal master is attainted; This scarce will solder our new ties of amity. BURLEIGH. The queen, sir, hath already cast them from her; England will not ally herself with France. My Lord of Kent, to you it now belongs Safe convoy to afford Count d'Aubespine. The furious mob have storm'd his house, and found An arsenal of weapons stored therein. Their threats are loud; and should he show himself He'll scarce 'scape outrage. You must answer for him. D'AUBESPINE. I shall depart, lords, from your lawless land, Where mobs tread under foot the rights of kings, And the people make a jest of the prince's plight. But be ye sure of this, my king will have A bloody reckoning for this contumely. BURLEIGH. Let him come for it, sir,âit shall not fail him. [Exeunt Kent and D'Aubespine. LEICESTER. Thus with one hand you violently tear The bond, that with the other you 'd scarce knit up So busily. Your pains, my lord, are hardly Worth England's thanks. BURLEIGH. My purpose, sir, was good; It fares not ill with those who dare say that. LEICESTER. Now must we look for the mysterious bearing Of Cecil, hunting out conspiracies; Now shall your lordship reap a good fat harvest Of the kind you love. A desperate deed is done, And darkness mantles up the doer. Now Shall we have a bloodier than Spain's Inquisition; And words, and looks, and thoughts be sternly dragg'd To your tribunal; for indeed you are A mighty man! an Atlas! on whose shoulders All England sits. BURLEIGH. And yet, I freely own you My master, my good lord; for such a victory As that your cunning yesterday achieved Ne'er graced my best endeavour. LEICESTER. What means that? BURLEIGH. Indeed 'twas politic, behind my back, To coax and wheedle, till to Fotheringay You lured the queen, our ever-honour'd mistressâ LEICESTER. Or to your face had been the same to me. BURLEIGH. The gracious queen you led to Fotheringayâ Yet, no, indeedâshe graciously led you. LEICESTER. Sir, I suppose your riddle has some meaning? BURLEIGH. A proper part, too, was she made to play. A noble triumph had you there prepared for her. Good queen! that ever such a shameless cheat Should have been practised on her easiness! Therefore were gentleness and pity commendable, And policy fit but to wait on them. Therefore was Mary Stuart so weak a foe; Alack! she was but worthy of contempt, Not the high honour of a mortal sentence. 'Twas a good plot, and wrought to a good point, Only so fine and sharp that the point broke. That was a pity! LEICESTER. Follow me to the queen! Before her will I answer you, false lord. BURLEIGH. Nay, I will meet you there, and look to 't well, Your charm of ready speech fail you not then; You'll find some need for it, believe me. [Exit Burleigh. LEICESTER. I'm betray'dâ Discover'd; he has hit upon my track. Accursed spy! what if he 've proof against me? If once the queen shall know the secret bond 'Twixt me and Mary Stuart!âhell, what a ruin Yawns at my feet! how shall she then remember The luckless counsel that to Fotheringay Led her? Why, what a villain, what a slave Of guilt and treachery, shall she then esteem me? The mock, the scorn, the sport of her hated rival Has she been made through me. Oh, never, never, Can that be cancell'd; all will seem to have been Prepared, made ready beforehand, for that scene. The black and bitter course of their conference, The poison'd taunts of her triumphant victim, Yea, ev'n the murderous stroke that follow'd them, All, all, shall I be held th'inventor ofâ Nothing can save me from perditionânothing. How now! who comes? [Enter Mortimer. MORTIMER. You are the man I seekâ Are we alone? LEICESTER. Hence, wretch! what seek'st thou here? MORTIMER. We are discover'dâthey are on our trackâ On yours tooâtherefore save yourself! LEICESTER. Avaunt! Begone! MORTIMER. The secret meetings at Count d'Aubespine's Are known of. LEICESTER. What is it to me? wilt leave me? MORTIMER. And he, the murderer, was one of the band. LEICESTER. Look to 't, and answer itâ'tis none of mine. Villain! what tell'st thou me of thy perilous case, Keep thy accursed secrets to thyself! MORTIMER. This touches you, my lordâ LEICESTER. Get thee to hell! Nor hang like an unlaid ghost about my path. Get hence! I know thee notâI hold no fellowship With stabbers. MORTIMER. ListenâI warn youâlisten yet; Your secret steps are known and countedâ LEICESTER. Ha! MORTIMER. To Fotheringay sped the Lord High Treasurer Soon as the accursed blow had fail'd; the chamber Of the queen was diligently search'd, and there Was foundâ LEICESTER. Whatâwhat? MORTIMER. A yet unfinish'd letter From her to you. LEICESTER. Oh, fatal woman! MORTIMER. Wherein She doth beseech you to hold faith with her, Renews the promise of her hand to you, Reminds you of her picture that you haveâ LEICESTER. Death and damnation! MORTIMER. Burleigh has the letter. LEICESTER. Ruin has caught me! MORTIMER. Yet is this moment yours. Be once beforehand with the fate that threatens you. Save her, and save yourself; swear, swear all down; Bethink you of all pleas, make dangers serve you. I can no moreâour weapons are all scatter'd, Our band dispersedâto Scotland I, to raise Another host of friends. Work you the while, See what your favour and bold front can do. LEICESTER. Yea, you say well. I willâwhat ho, there, officer! [Enter an Officer of the Queen's Guard. Arrest that traitor! and in strict ward keep himâ A vile conspiracy have I lighted on, The news of which I straight bear to the queen. [Exit Leicester. MORTIMER. Dastardly traitor! yet am I rightly served Who laid a noble trust on such a wretch; He sets his foot upon my neck, to spring, And my dead body bridges o'er his ruin. So save thyself, most miserable man! My lips shall not be open'd to betray thee; Not ev'n in death would I have thee for fellow, And life is the sole good of such as thou. [To the Guards, who approach him. What wouldst thou, thou poor slave of tyranny? I am not thine, but free. [He draws a dagger. OFFICER. Ha! seize him; He's arm'd! he hath a dagger! MORTIMER. Free! and freely In this my latest hour shall my soul speak. My curse upon ye all! who your God and queen Alike deny; who to the heavenly And the earthly Mary traitors are alike; Who to this bastard queen your souls have soldâ OFFICER. Hence with the ribald railer! hence with him. MORTIMER. Beloved, ah, beloved! I may not save thee, But love's last counsel in my death I leave thee; Oh, holy Queen of Heaven receive me! pray for me! [He stabs himself. Scene 2. The Queen's chamber. Enter Elizabeth, followed by Burleigh; she holds a letter in her hand. ELIZABETH. What, fool'd to such a height! what, such a game To play with me! with me! in treacherous triumph To lead me as a show for his wanton's mirth! Did any woman e'er endure such outrage? BURLEIGH. Yet can I not conceive what art, what might, What magic he employ'd, the keener sense Of my gracious mistress so to hoodwink. ELIZABETH. Silence! I burst with rage and shame! his toolâhis puppet! I went to humble her, and was myself The football of her scorn. BURLEIGH. Now may your majesty Perceive, the counsel that I gave was wholesome. ELIZABETH. Yea, yea, I smart right sorely for not trusting it; For turning from your wise and faithful teaching. Yet how could I doubt him? how in the vows Of truest love and service spy out snares? Whom shall I dare to trust when Leicester's false? He that I've made greater than the greatest here; That nearest to my heart and person stood; Whom I have taught this court to look upon As its lord and princeâin all but name a king. BURLEIGH. And he the while repaid you, by betraying Your love and trust for this fair Queen of Scots. ELIZABETH. She shall pay it with her blood! fair Queen of Scots! Is the sentence ready? BURLEIGH. Ay, so please you, madam. ELIZABETH. She shall die, and he shall see it; and die himself After; from out my breast I've turn'd him forth, And the love I bore him; fury hath fill'd his place. As high as his pow'r and favour were, so deep Shall be his downfall and disgrace; he shall be A fearful token of my wrath henceforth, As hitherto the object of my weakness. To the Tower with him! I will name the peers Who presently shall judge him. I give him over To the law's utmost rigour. BURLEIGH. Oh, doubt not, madam, That he will seek to clear himselfâ ELIZABETH. How? how? Doth not this letter impeach and sentence him? This treason blinds one in the eyes. Here, read it! BURLEIGH. But you are mild and merciful; and he Hath spells in his looks, and witchcraft in his words. ELIZABETH. I will not see him! never, never again! Have you, my lord, given order when he comes He shall be denied our presence? BURLEIGH. Madam, I have. A PAGE (announcing). The Earl of Leicester! ELIZABETH. Insolent villain! what? Bid him pack; we will not see him, tell him so; Bid him get hence. PAGE. So please your gracious majesty, I dare not answer so the earl, for he Would not believe me. ELIZABETH. Is it come to this? I've made this man so big, that my own servant Cannot see me for him. BURLEIGH. Dost hear, the queen Forbids the earl's approach? ELIZABETH. And yet, if 'twere soâ If he could clear himselfâBurleigh, how think you? Is it impossible but this might be An evil snare of the Scottish woman yonder, To make me banish the truest friend I have? She is a cunning plotter and contriver, And it may be that she hath writ all this To sow distraction in my mind, and pluck His ruin on his head, because he hates her. It may be? BURLEIGH. Gracious madam, it might be, but yetâ [Leicester throws open the door and enters haughtily. LEICESTER. Let me behold that brave bold man that dares Forbid me the presence of my sov'reign lady. ELIZABETH. Audacious! LEICESTER. What, not see me! send me hence! Shall Burleigh stand where I am not admitted? BURLEIGH, You are overdaring, sir, to rush in thus, Forbid! LEICESTER. You are overdaring, sir, to speak Until you're bid. Forbidâforbidâforsooth! Who in this court bids or forbids me? who But thou, dear mistress, from whose lips aloneâ ELIZABETH. Out of my sight, thou poisonous traitor! LEICESTER. No! Not thou, dear mistress, speakest to thy servant; This lord here prompts thy angry wordsâin vain; To thee, dear mistress, I appeal against him; To him thou hast lent thine earâto me Deny it not, oh sovereign queen of my soul! ELIZABETH. Speak, villain! and heap up thy treachery With perjury. Deny his charge! LEICESTER. But, first, Before I speak, bid him begone. My lord, What to my queen I come to say shall have No ear but hers. Goâ ELIZABETH. Stay, I command you! LEICESTER. What makes a third 'twixt thee and me, dear mistress; We pray not Heaven for standers by to hear. The right and privilege of my place I claim, The right and privilege of thy counsellors, And say again, this listening lord shall hence. ELIZABETH. Why thy bold speech becomes thy towering treason. LEICESTER. It becomes one made fortunate by thy favour, And who, how small soe'er himself, is lifted By that alone 'bove him and all the world. Thy grace hath given me all the pride I have, And what thy grace hath given my life shall keep; And so by Heaven this man shall hence, nor dare To stand another moment 'twixt us twain. ELIZABETH. He thinks to talk himself again into favour. LEICESTER. No, I leave talking to whose trade it is; Yet to thy heart will I speak. What I have done, Strong in thy gracious favour, I'll make good And justify; for in thy bosom sits The judge whose sentence I acknowledge. ELIZABETH. Traitor! I have no thought but cries out guilty on theeâ Show him that letter. BURLEIGH. Here, my lord. LEICESTER. The hand Is Mary Stuart'sâ ELIZABETH. Stop thy mouth with that! LEICESTER. I own this shows against me; yet well I hope, The trial of my faith stands not on shows. ELIZABETH. Come, then, with that in thy hand, swear traitor, That thou wast not in secret league with her, Ne'er hadst her picture, never swor'st to free her. LEICESTER. Why, it were easy, madam, were I guilty, To thrust this witness of my foes aside; But as my heart is free, I do not fear To own (how strange soe'er it seem) that she Hath writ the truth. ELIZABETH. Indeed! oh, hath she so! BURLEIGH. Out of his own mouth he's condemn'd. ELIZABETH. Hence with him To the Tower! thou traitorous villain! LEICESTER. I am none. That I have held this thing a secret from you, Therein, perchance, I've sinn'd; yet as the stake Was to lure on your rival to her ruin, I thought close counsel best till the game was won. ELIZABETH. Oh, miserable juggler! BURLEIGH. How, my lord! LEICESTER. A bold cast have I ventured, and well know Leicester alone in all this land durst tempt it; The world has not to learn to-day, the hatred I bear to Mary Stuart; the rank I hold, And the queen's trust in me, challenge some faith, And something weigh 'gainst the doubt that questions me; And 'twas no less than that man's duty she Had with her favour glorified, to find A way none other dared have tried to serve her. BURLEIGH. Why was so good a work a mystery? LEICESTER. My lord, we know it is your wont to preface Your doing with much saying; 'tis not mine. You sound the trumpet still to your own deeds, And ring your bell before youâthat's your fashion; I act before I speak. BURLEIGH. I think, indeed, Your speaking now is sore against your will. LEICESTER. With right good will you've spoken your great doings; Wonderful judgment! the queen, our mistress' safety, The treason of her foes, all have you seen, And done, and known, for nothing sure outruns, Or lurks behind, your lynx-eyed vigilance. Yet, despite thee, poor boasting gentleman, This day had Mary Stuart been set free, Had not I hinder'd it. BURLEIGH. You! LEICESTER. I, my lord. The queen was pleased to trust one Mortimer; To whom her secret counsels she laid bare; And went indeed so far, as to beg of him A bloody piece of service; to the which His uncle, as you will remember, sir, Could not be brought or bribedâis not this so? Say? BURLEIGH. If it were, 'tis scarce your business, sir. LEICESTER. But it is so. Now then, my lord; where were Your thousand eyes, that ne'er a one of them Spied out this Mortimer for a pestilent traitor? A raging papist, instrument of the Guise, And sold slave to the Queen of Scots? the chief Of those who were all sworn to set her free, And murder our gracious mistress? ELIZABETH. Mortimer! LEICESTER. Through him were her overtures first made to me; And so I learnt to know him what he was. To-dayâthis very hourâhe had been borne To prisonâfor within this hour himself Did liberally unfold their purposes to me. I had him seized; but in the desperate rage Of seeing his good work fall all to pieces, And himself unmask'd, he madly slew himself. ELIZABETH. I'm lost in wonder!âheâthat Mortimerâ LEICESTER. For mine own part, I heartily could wish He had not made away with himself. His witness, Had he lived, should have clear'd me to the utmost; Therefore indeed I bade them guard him straitly. I would have had him sifted through and through By the most searching process of the law, So had mine innocence been made apparent. BURLEIGH. How did you say, my lordâhe slew himself? Or he was slain by you? LEICESTER. Oh, base suggestion! Let the officer of the watch be call'd, to show I gave him up. [Goes to the door and calls. Within there! [Enter Officer of the Queen's Guard. To her majesty Relate the process of that Mortimer's death. OFFICER. Being on guard, I stood in the anteroom, When the Earl of Leicester, flinging wide the doors, Bade me arrest, as guilty of high treason, The man he spoke withâMortimer. We did so; But ere we could secure him or prevent it, He drew his dagger, and in a desperate frenzy, Shrieking out curses 'gainst the queen and state, He stabb'd himself, and died there where he fell. LEICESTER. Enoughâyou may withdraw; the queen is satisfied. [Exit Officer. ELIZABETH. What an abyss of villainous treachery! LEICESTER. Now, who did save thee, guard thee, and defend thee? Did Burleigh see the peril all about thee, And turn away its hand ere it had clutch'd thee? Thy faithful Leicester was thy guardian angel. BURLEIGH. This Mortimer kill'd himself in the nick of time For you, my lordâa most convenient caitiff. ELIZABETH. I know not what to say, for I believe theeâ And yet believe thee not. I think thee guiltyâ And then I think it not. Pernicious woman! Who in this web has tangled all my mind! LEICESTER. Now must she die; now for her death myself Do give my voice. Long did I counsel, madam, That you should leave unsign'd the fatal warrant, At least until again some arm was raised In her behalf against you. It has befallen; And now I hold her sentence be fulfill'd. BURLEIGH. You counsel itâyou? LEICESTER. Even to the last I seized on the faintest shadow of excuse, That from this dire extremity might save The heart of our good mistress; but I see Her precious safety needs this bloody sacrifice; And I do hope, and pray, yea, and advise, That judgment be forthwith made execution. BURLEIGH. His lordship is so earnest in this matter, That I well hope your gracious majesty Will to no other but himself commit The bearing of her doom to Mary Stuart. LEICESTER. WhoâI? What is't you say? BURLEIGH. You, my good lord. Nor could a readier means be furnish'd you To clear the doubts that even now o'ershadow'd The sunlight of your truth, than that you should Lead her to death whom you have stood accused Of loving more than might beseem your loyalty. ELIZABETH. 'Tis a good counsel; and we will it so. LEICESTER. Methinks my rank might from this gloomy office Have well absolved me; 'tis a service fits A thousand ways Lord Burleigh more than me; Who to the queen stands in such honour'd nearness, So bloody and so black a task beseems not. Yet am I nothing slow to show my zeal, And serve my dearest mistress even thus. I will not claim exemption even from this, And from your hand accept the hateful duty. ELIZABETH. Burleigh, or Kent, shall share it with you; see That all things be made ready for the end. [Exit Burleigh. [Tumult without. Enter hurriedly the Earl of Kent. How now, my lord of Kent? what new distraction Upheaves the city? what's the matter now? KENT. Madam, the people gather round the palace, Clamouring to see your highness. ELIZABETH. Wherefore? KENT. Fear has possess'd all London of your death; A thousand evil rumours are abroad That your life is threaten'd; that fee'd murderers, Sent by the pope, walk 'mong your faithful subjects. The cry goes through the streets that you were stabb'd; That the papists are all sworn togetherâbandedâ The Scottish woman to set free by force, And make her queen; so goes the common voice. The citizens are in uproar, and they clamour For the head of Mary Stuart; nor will A lesser offering appease their rage. ELIZABETH. How! shall we be compell'd to what we will not? KENT. They have resolved not to disperse themselves Till they have word the sentence has been sign'd. [Re-enter Burleigh and Davison with the sentence. ELIZABETH. Now, sirâwhat's this? DAVISON. Your majesty commandedâ ELIZABETH (taking the paper). What is it? O God! BURLEIGH. Hear you the people's voice? Madam, that is the voice of God. ELIZABETH. My lordsâ My lordsâI am beyond all measure troubled! Who shall assure me that I hear indeed The voice of my people and the voice of God! I tell you, sirs, I fearâyea, I do fearâ If I obey this voice that clamours to me, Another voice some other day to hear; Nay, or perchance this same, this very same, That now doth loudly urge me to the deed, When the deed's done as loudly shall condemn it. [Enter Shrewsbury. SHREWSBURY. Madam, they drag you to a desperate pass, Where you shall neither back nor forward go With safety. Oh, be stedfast, and stand firm! [Seeing Davison. Orâis it done? is it irrevocable? The fatal document I see he holds; But it has not been laid before the eyes Of my gracious mistress yet? ELIZABETH. O Shrewsbury! Where shall I turn for counsel? They compel meâ SHREWSBURY. Compel you, madam! who may dare compel you? Are you not sovereign here? Is not your will Paramount law? Speak, and command to silence Each insolent voice, that dares make itself heard To urge your deed, or sway your royal will. A blind and furious fear drives on the people; Yourself are not yourself; this tumult scares Even your spirit; this is no time to judge! BURLEIGH. Judgment is not the question now, my lord; Judgment is pass'd long since; 'tis execution Of judgment now we seek. KENT (looking from the window). The crowd comes gathering; A tide it seems, rolling its ridges in; I know not how this surge shall be kept back. ELIZABETH (to SHREWSBURY). You see how I am driven. SHREWSBURY. Nay, but delay Is all I ask; upon this stroke of the pen Hang the future peace and fortune of your reign, Years have not brought you to determine on it; Shall a moment's storm and outcry counsel you? A short delayâgather your stedfast purpose, And wait an hour of quiet. BURLEIGH. Waitâloiterâlingerâ Till the whole realm is red-hot with sedition; Till at length your enemy strikes true at last. Three times has God from her hand deliver'd you, To-day it had well nigh reach'd you. Once again To hope such miracle is to tempt Heaven. SHREWSBURY. That God who with his wonder-working hand Hath four times led you safe beside your doom, And who to this old arm to-day gave pow'r To beat your murderer down, deserves your trust. I will not now invoke the voice of justice; With this tempest in your ears you could not hear it. But hear you this: before this living woman You quail; fear not the living, but the dead. Fear her beheaded, bloody corpse; for that Shall from the block spring up, and up and down, Through the whole land shall run, scaring your kingdom Like an avenging ghostâa devil of discordâ And all your people's hearts shall she turn from you. They hate her now, because they've learnt to fear her, But when they fear her not, they will avenge her. No more the living enemy of their faith, But the murder'd kinswoman of their kings, The pitiful sacrifice of hate and envy, Will they behold in her, and pity her, And quickly will you feel their alter'd mood. Ride then through London, after execution Is done on her; 'stead of the loyal crowds That still have clamour'd welcome round your way, Another England, and another people, Then will you find, I trow; for then no more Shall the victorious righteousness surround you That conquer'd for you all men's hearts; but fear, Terror, th'accursed guard of tyranny, Shall shuddering go before you and behind, And make your city's streets a wilderness. You will have struck a fatal blow indeed; For who shall dare feel safe when that anointed And crowned head has fallen? ELIZABETH. Shrewsbury, This day thou'st saved my life, the murderer's steel Hast thou this day turn'd from me; by Heaven! I would He had struck home, and no man hinder'd him! All strife were ended, every doubt at rest, And I were laid in peace in my grave. I swear, Living and reigning are a bitter burthen, And I would well I were well eased of both. Must one queen fall that the other may stand fast? Yea, yea, it must be so; I know it; but wherefore, In Heaven's name, should not ourselves strike under, And give the battle up, and let her reign? Let the people choose, for I will give them back My royalty, and they shall freely lend it To whom they will. God is my witness, lords! Not for myself, but for my people's welfare, Have I cared my whole life long; natheless, perchance, They hope from this fair, flattering Queen of Scots, This younger woman, days more prosperous. So be it! from my throne I will come down Right readily, and turn me back to Woodstock, To the abode of peace where sped my youth; There, far from the evil strife of power, I found Greatness within myself. 'Tis true, by God! I am not fit to rule; a ruler's heart Should be of iron, mine is woman weak. Hitherto happily I've ruled this land: For to make happy is an easy task; Now comes this first stern call of royal duty, And I confess myself unfit to reign. BURLEIGH. By Heaven! when such a word from the queen's lips Falls, let my longer silence be held treasonâ Treason to duty, treason to Englandâlonger To hold my peace. If, madam, as you say, And as we all believe, you love indeed Your people better than yourself, now show it! Turn not away to the haven of your peace, And give the kingdom up to storm and tempest. Think of our faith; with Mary Stuart comes The ancient superstition back again. Again the monk shall lord it o'er the land, And, sent by Rome, audacious legates come To bar our church doors up, and, from their throne, Curse down our kings. Think of the precious souls Of those you rule; ev'n as you now determine, So are they lost or saved. This is no time For weakly woman's pity; your first duty Is to your people. Shrewsbury to-day Has saved your highness' life; for me remains A task more glorious yet, 'tis to save England. ELIZABETH. Let me be left alone; in this great matter I find no help nor comfort in your counsels; Before the Highest Judge I will debate This business with my soul. He will enlighten me, And by His will alone will I shape mine. Leave us, my lords. [To Davison. You, sir, remain at hand. [Exeunt all but Elizabeth and Davison, who stands at a distance. ELIZABETH. Oh, slavery of kings! oh, curse of power! Detested tyranny of the popular will! How sick at heart with weariness I am Of flattering this gross god that I despise! When shall I sit in freedom on my throne? When may I cease to beg opinion's cheer? The âWell done!â of the rabble rout to court? To bow to this people, who, with juggler's tricks, Must still be kept agape, and in good humour? 'Sdeath! he's no king who still is tied to observe The will of the world, and set his every act To whatsoever measure suits their mind. Fool that I was, still to deal uprightly, And all my life the free course of my will To bridle with their liking! Now dare I not Do this one deed of sov'reignty. I cannot Move, for myself have tied my own hands up; The pattern of my hitherto life condemns me; And, for I've still been just, I still must be so. Had I been bold and tyrannous like her, My predecessor, bloody Spanish Mary, Now might I spill this royal blood unblamed, And none had dared to whisper. Not of my own Free will chose I this narrow path of duty, Nor willingly walk'd unswervingly therein. All powerful necessity, that rules The wild waves of the stormy sea, compels The will of kings, and laid this virtue on me. Hemm'd round with bitter foes, the people's favour Alone upholds me on my dangerous seat; Whilst to mine overthrow are sworn a thousand Enemies from without and from within. Upon my head the Roman priest has pour'd The scorching curse of excommunication; France, with a smiling Judas kiss betrays me; And open threatening of huge armaments The Spaniard brings against me on the sea. So stand I here a weaponless, weak woman, Fighting against a world! With royal virtues Must I cloak o'er my thin and threadbare claim; The flaw in my birthright, and the bitter slur By my own father cast upon my blood, I cannot hideâmy rival's eager hate Hath stript it naked to the world, and held it, An everlasting blot, up to mine eyes. Nay, but this fear shall end. Her head shall fall. I will have peace, by God! I swear I will. She is the fury of my lifeâa spectre Whose shadow stands for ever in my sunlight. Where I have sown a flowering joy to cheer me, She, the accursed snake, crawls from beneath it. My lover hath she stol'n from meâmy bridegroom Driven henceâeach several plague and smart of my life Calls itself Mary Stuart. She shall die! And I will be as free as mountain air! With what a deadly scorn she look'd upon me, As though her eyes could fell me to the earth. Impotent fool! I carry deadlier weapons, That, touching thee, shall smite thee into nothing. A bastard am I! Why, thou wretched woman, 'Tis only while thou liv'st that I am oneâ The doubt that stains my royal scutcheon's wash'd Clean from it with thy blood; for from the hour That no more choice remains between us two, I am the rightful queen of this landâthy death To the whole world makes me legitimate. [She signs the sentence rapidly, lets the pen fall from her hand, and withdraws from the table with an expression of terror: after a pause she rings: Davison comes forward. ELIZABETH. Where are the lords? DAVISON. So please you, they are gone To still the tumult of the raging people. Soon as the Earl of Shrewsbury appear'd, â'Tis he!â exclaim'd at once an hundred voices, âThere he is! That is he who saved the queen! The best and bravest man in England!â Then Began the noble Talbot to address them, And with such winning wisdom, powerful gentleness, And cunning craft, convincingly he spoke, That all grew still, and presently in peace The well-contented multitude dispersed. ELIZABETH. Unstable-minded herd! that every breath Hither and thither drives. Woe, woe to those Who lean upon that reed! You may be gone, sir. Stayâtake this paperâto your hand I give it. DAVISON. Your majesty's signatureâO Heaven, 'tis is sign'd! ELIZABETH. 'Twas brought to me to sign, and I have sign'd it. Well, and what then? A sheet of paper signifies Nothing; a written name kills not. DAVISON. Your name, Beneath this sheet of paper, signifies No less than sudden death. Madam, it is The thunderstroke that carries instant doom. This paper doth command the Lords Commissioners And sheriff with all speed to Fotheringay, There to make known to the Queen of Scots her sentence, And with to-morrow's dawn to execute it. Here's no delayâshe may be said to have lived When I let go this paper. ELIZABETH. Even so. God lays a great and weighty destiny In your weak handâpray to Him heartily, That He may lend His wisdom to your mind. I leave you to the doing of your duty. DAVISON. Nay, dread and gracious sovereign! leave me not Till you make known your royal will to me; Here must I dare no otherwise be wise Than point by point to follow your command. Hath your grace committed this to me, that I Should to the fatal issue forward it? ELIZABETH. Be that according to your own discretion. DAVISON. To mine! to my discretion! God forbid! Obedience is my very verge of duty. Your servant, madam, dares not here be judge The smallest oversight were a queen's murderâ A terrible and unredeemable crime. Nay, grant me, I most humbly do implore you, In this great matter to be nothing more Than your blind and irresponsible instrument. Speak, for the love of God! once, in plain words; What is your will that I should do with this? ELIZABETH. Doth not its own name tell thee plain enough? DAVISON. You will, then, that this sentence be fulfill'dâ ELIZABETH. Nay, but I said not so, and quake to think it! DAVISON. You will, then, that I yet delay to send it? ELIZABETH. At thy peril! see thou to the consequence! DAVISON. Merciful Heaven! what is your gracious will? ELIZABETH. My will! my will is with this damned thing No more to be plagued!âmy will is to have peace And rest from this matter henceforth and for ever! DAVISON. It costs your highness but a single word; Speak, madamâsayâwhat shall be done with it? ELIZABETH. I have already spoken; weary me No more, but get thee gone. DAVISON. Oh, royal lady, What have you spoken? you have spoken nothing. Dread sovereign, may it please youâ ELIZABETH. God confound thee! DAVISON. Have mercy on me! but a few short months Have I fill'd this office, nothing do I know Of courtly speech, or the great use of royaltyâ Simple and lowly hath my breeding been; Have mercy then, on your unworthy slave! Grudge not, dread majesty! to speak the word That teaches me my duty and your will! [He approaches her in a beseeching attitude, she turns her back on him; he stands in despair, and then suddenly exclaims, Take back this paper! take it back again! It burns like fire in my uncertain hand. Lay not on me the burthen of your choice To serve your highness in this fearful business! ELIZABETH. What prate ye there! you know your office. Do it! [Exit the Queen. Enter Burleigh. DAVISON. She goesâshe leaves me without help or counsel, Bewilder'd, with this sentence in my hand; What now to do? Shall I deliver it, Or keep it back? Oh, welcome, noble lord! You to this post of honour did advance me; Now set me free from it. I undertook it Nought knowing of its perilous dutiesâlet me Go back to my former lowliness again, For sure I do not fit a loftier place. BURLEIGH. How now, sirâwhat's the matter? where's the sentence? Did not the queen send for you? DAVISON. In fearful wrath She went hence, even nowâhelp meâadvise meâ Here is the sentence, sign'd. BURLEIGH. Sign'd! give it, quick! DAVISON. Nay, but I dare notâ BURLEIGH. How! DAVISON. Her majesty Hath not yet clearly shown her will as touching it. BURLEIGH. Not clearly? She has signed it; give it me! DAVISON. Must I to execution put itâmust I not? What should I do? BURLEIGH. Why, with thy utmost speed Have it fulfill'd, thou 'rt lost by this delay. DAVISON. By too rash speed am I lost too. BURLEIGH. Give itâgive it! Fool, thou art frighted from thy witsâto me Give up the sentence! [He seizes it and rushes out. DAVISON. Hold, for the love of God! [He rushes after him. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene 1. The same scene as during the First Act. Hannah Kennedy in deep mourning; her eyes are red with weeping, and her whole deportment indicating a deep but calm affliction, is busied sealing letters and packets. She occasionally interrupts herself to weep, and sometimes suspends her occupation, to pray. Paulet and Drury also attired in black enter, followed by a number of servants carrying gold and silver vessels, mirrors, pictures, and other costly objects, and place them at the back of the stage. Paulet delivers to Hannah a jewel casket, and a paper, indicating by a gesture, that the latter contains an inventory of the things collected together. At the sight of these Hannah's grief becomes more poignant; she sinks down overcome with sorrow, while the others silently withdraw. Enter Melvil. Kennedy, perceiving him, shrieks. KENNEDY. Melvil, 'tis you! once more do I behold you. MELVIL. Yes, faithful Kennedy, we meet once more. KENNEDY. After this long and bitter separationâ MELVIL. We are rewarded by this bitter meeting. KENNEDY. O God, then you are comeâ MELVIL. To take my last, My everlasting farewell of my queen. KENNEDY. To-day at lastâto-day, when she must die, The sight of her faithful servants long denied, Is now vouchsafed to her. O worthiest sir! I will not ask how it has fared with you, I dare not tell how it has fared with us. Ah! there will come an hour for that sad story. O Melvil, that we e'er were born to see The dreadful dawn of such a day as this! MELVIL. Let us not with vain tears weaken each other; Yea, I will weep to the latest hour I live; Never will I put off death's dismal livery, Nor ever shall a smile brighten my face. After to-day I'll weep all days away, But for to-day, I will not shed one tear; I will be stedfastâand be you so too, I pray you; and, howe'er the rest do bear them, Let us, with faithful fortitude, support Our mistress' steps, on the dark road to death. KENNEDY. Melvil, you are deceived if you believe The queen doth need our help to perish nobly. She holds a dauntless pattern to us all, And Mary Stuart dies a royal heroine. MELVIL. How did she bear the tidings of her doom? 'Tis said she barely was allow'd due warning. KENNEDY. No, truly was she not; far other fears Ruffled our lady's breast; not at her death, But at her bold deliverer she trembled. Freedom was sworn to us; this very night, Mortimer should have borne us from this place, And between fear and hope, trembling and doubting Whether her royal person and sacred honour To trust to the daring youthâin fears like these, The queen sat palely, watching for the dawn. A sudden uproar sounded through the castle, Knocking and heavy hammering reached our ears We thought the hour of our deliverance come, Hope sprang a-tiptoe, and sweet love of freedom Rush'd irresistible through every heart; The doors flew wide, and Paulet stood before usâ And told us that the sounds beneath our feet Was the noise of building up the hideous scaffold. [She turns from him, weeping bitterly. MELVIL. Merciful Heaven! oh tell me, how endured The queen this dreadful change from life to death? KENNEDY (after a pause in which she collects herself). Suddenlyâwithout pauseâin one dire moment, The change smote her from that which is of time, To what eternal is; God gave her grace In this one instant bravely back to thrust All earthly hope, and with a stedfast soul, Made strong by faith, to seize at once on heaven. No dastard hue of fear, no weak complaint, Disgraced our queen: only, when first she heard Lord Leicester's villainous treason, and the fate Of the true-hearted youth murder'd for her, And saw the sorrow of his poor old uncle, Whose latest hope died in his deathâthen only The tears flow'd forth, and not for her own fate, But for the suffering of her enemy. MELVIL. Where is she? May I not behold her face? KENNEDY. The rest of the night she spent in fervent prayerâ She wrote farewells to her nearest friends and kindred. And with a firm hand drew her latest testament. Now she is taking a few moments' restâ Her last of earthly sleep now gently soothes her. MELVIL. Who stays by her? KENNEDY. Burgoyne, her highness' leech, And the women of her chamber. [Enter Margaret Kurl. How now, Kurl, Is our mistress risen? KURL. Up, and already dress'd; She asks for you. KENNEDY. I come; nay, follow not, I must prepare our lady for your sight. [Exit Kennedy. KURL. Melvil! her highness' Master of the Household. MELVIL. The same. KURL. Alas! nor house nor household more. Melvil, you come from London; of my husband Bring you no tidings? MELVIL. Yes, he will be free, So runs the rumourâwhenâ KURL. The queen is dead. The shameless traitor! e'en by him alone Is our dear lady murder'd; his false witness Drags her to death! MELVIL. 'Tis even so. KURL. A curse Deeper than hell seize on his traitor's soul! For he hath lied, and is a murderer. MELVIL. Take heed to your words. KURL. Before their judgment seat I'll swear and prove itâcast it in his teeth, And fill the whole world with his infamy. She's innocent! MELVIL. God grant she may be so! [Enter Burgoyne. BURGOYNE. Melvil! MELVIL. Burgoyne! [They embrace. BURGOYNE. Good mistress Margaret, Fetch hither for her grace a cup of wine. MELVIL. How?âis she sick? BURGOYNE. Nayâstrong, and of good cheer, And saith she hath no need to break her fast; But she has yet much terror to encounter, And it shall ne'er be said by those who hate her, That the grim sight of death whitens her cheeks, When nature fails alone in physical strength. [Enter Kennedy. Melvil. Now will she see me? KENNEDY. You shall see her straight. You gaze around you with astonishment, And in your glance I read what moves your wonder; Costly appliances for easy life, And all these shining precious baubles, gather'd In the black house of doom. O sir! while living, Stint and privation daily she endured; Plenty and splendour have come here with death. [Enter two of the queen's women dressed in mourning: at the sight of Melvil they break out in weeping. MELVIL. Oh, fatal day! oh, what a meeting, Gertrude! Rosamond! FIRST LADY. She hath sent us all away. Alone, for the last time, she seeks her God. [Enter Margaret Kurl with a goblet of wine; she sets it on a table, and falls pale and trembling into a chair. MELVIL. What ails you, mistress? What new woe befalls us? KURL. O God! BURGOYNE. What is't? KURL. Great God, what have I seen! MELVIL. Nay, but compose yourself and speak: what is it? KURL. As in my hand the wine goblet I bore, And slowly mounted the great stairs that lead From the hall below, a door was open'd wide, And I beheldâO God! I sawâ MELVIL. Speakâwhat? KURL. The walls all hung with black; a mighty scaffold, All wrapped in black, reared itself from the floor; In the midst a cushion, block, and glittering axe. The hall was filled with men, who round the scaffold Thronging, with bloody looks stood greedily, Waiting their victim. ROSAMOND. God have mercy on her! MELVIL. Peace now, control yourselves, she comes! [Enter Mary, splendidly dressed in white; round her neck, fastened to a chain of precious stones, is an Agnus Dei; a rosary hangs at her girdle; she holds a crucifix in her hand; a diadem is on her head, and a long black veil is thrown back from her hair; when she enters, all the others divide on either side, giving signs of the bitterest grief. Melvil, overcome with sorrow, has sunk upon his knee. MARY (gazing round the circle with a calm serenity). Wherefore lament ye? Wherefore weep ye? Rather Rejoice with me, that my long race of misery At length is run. My chains have fallen off, My prison gates stand wide, and my glad soul On angels' wings soars to eternal freedom! When to mine enemy's hand I was deliver'd To endure unworthy insult and contempt, And thraldom, shameful for a free-born queenâ Then ye did well to weep. Oh, weep not now! Beneficent and healing, Death draws near, That solemn friend, under whose sable wings My sorrow shall lie hid for evermore. From my deep humiliation honour springs, Upon my head again I feel my crown, And in my soul once more a royal pride. [Seeing Melvil. How, Melvil here! nay, not so. Good, good Melvil, Stand up, for to thy queen's last earthly triumph Thou 'rt comeânot to her death. Oh, praised be God For this unlook'd-for mercy! In this hour My fame shall not lie in mine enemy's mouth. Beside me in mine agony shall stand One witness for me, unto whom I'm known. Oh, tell me, Melvil, how has all fared with thee In this unfriendly and ungodly land, Since thou wert banish'd from thy poor queen's sight? The thought of thee has ofttimes made me woe. MELVIL. I have known but one hardshipâonly oneâ That I no more might see you, gracious mistress! MARY. How is it with Didier, my faithful chamberlain? But I bethink meâit is well with him; He was an old man; doubtless he is dead. MELVIL. God has not granted him so great a mercy; He lives to weep on your untimely bier. MARY. Alas! before I die, not to have known The joy of clasping one beloved head, Or strain'd the hand of one of mine own kindred. But it is well; 'mongst strangers I shall die, And see at least no other tears but yours. Melvil, my latest wishes for my loved ones I lay within your faithful breast:âI bless My brother-in-law the Most Christian King of France, And the whole royal house of France I greet; My uncle cardinal I reverently bless, And Henry of Guise, my ever noble cousin; I bless the pope, the holy vicar of Christ, Who will send back his precious blessing to me; And the Most Catholic King of Spain, who nobly Offer'd himself my champion and avenger. All of them are remember'd in my will; Nor will they the last tokens of my love Value the less that they are poor in value. [Turning to her servants. I have commended your forlorn estate To the King of France, my royal brother, who Will care for you and find you another home. Tarry not here; let no proud English eyes Feed their disdain with sight of your despair; Nor in the dust behold who did me service. Even by this image of the Crucified Promise me all to leave this fatal land So soon as I shall have gone hence for ever. MELVIL (laying his hand on the crucifix). I swear it, in the name of all of these! MARY. Beggar'd as I am, all that remains to meâ All that I yet have leave to call my ownâ I have divided to you; and I trust That my last will shall meet with due respect. These, the sad trappings of my death journey, I do but borrow. Lend me but once more Earth's poor adornings, on my way to heav'n. [To her younger women. To you, my Alice, Gertrude, Rosamond, I do bequeath my pearls and my attirings; Such baubles well become your youthful years. [To Kurl. Margaret, thou hast the first claim on my bounty, For thou of all I part from art the saddest. That I do not avenge on thee the guilt Of thy unhappy husband, thou wilt find By my bequest. My dearest, truest Hannah! What are to thee jewels of price or gold? To thee I leave my last remembranceâtake This handkerchief; I have with mine own hand Wrought it for thee, in my long prison hours; And many of my tears are therein woven. Over my eyes bind thou this handkerchiefâ When it is time. This last and dearest office Will I receive from thee, my faithful Hannah. KENNEDY. O Melvil, how shall I endureâ MARY. Come now, Come all of ye, and take my last farewell! Fare thee well Margaret, and farewell my Alice; Thanks, Burgoyne, for thy true and faithful service. Thy lips are burning hot, poor Gertrude! Oh, Sore hated have I beenâbut well loved, too; Some noble-minded man shall be thy mate, Whose love shall give thy warm heart happiness. My Bertha, thou hast chosen the better part, And Heaven's holy bride shalt thou become. Haste thou thy sacred calling to fulfil. How treacherous are the blessings of this earth Learn from thy queen. Enough; now all is overâ Farewell! farewell! for ever fare ye well! [She turns herself quickly from them. Exeunt all but Melvil. MARY. Thus have I set my earthly house in order, And hope in debt to no one to depart Out of this world. One thing alone remains, Melvilâone thing which the yet fetter'd soul Craves ere it soars in joy and freedom hence. MELVIL. Utter your wish; lighten your loaded heart. To your true friend and servant speak your care. MARY. I stand upon the threshold of eternity; Before the Almighty Judge soon must I stand; And yet I have not made my last atonement. No priest of our Holy Church has access to me; And from the hand of a false priest I loathe To take the holy bread of the Eucharist. In the true faith of my own Church I die, That can alone give peace unto my soul. MELVIL. Then bid your heart be still. Heaven will accept Your deep desire ev'n as its own fulfilment. The pow'r of tyrants can but bind our hands; The soul on its own longing springs to God. The letter is dead; the spirit, the spirit lives! MARY. True, Melvil; but, alas! 'tis not enough; Weak earthly faith craves for an earthly sign, By which it makes Heaven's highest boon its own. For this God became man; for this is clothed The invisible and heavenly gift of grace, Mysteriously in an outward visible form. Our Church alone, the high, the holy one, Builds up the ladder that we climb to heaven, The universal Catholic Church, well named! For the faith of all grows faith of each. There thousands pray and worship; there the flame Of adoration glows; and, rapt on wings Of fire, the spirit is borne away to heaven. Ah, blessed they! to whom the joy is given To kneel together in God's holy house! Deck'd is the altar, and the tapers burning; Solemnly toll the bells; the incense rises; The bishop, radiant in his sacred vestments, Takes forth the cup and blesses it; and lo! The ineffable wonder of miraculous change! Prone on the earth before their present God The people fall, believing and adoring. Me miserable! I alone am barr'd; Heaven's gracious gift to all reaches not me. MELVIL. Yea, it doth reach theeâyea, it is beside thee. Trust the All Powerful! the wither'd staff Can in the hand of faith put forth fresh buds; And He that from the rock smote living waters Can in thy prison build Himself an altar, And change this cup of corporal refreshment To one that shall give quickening to thy soul. [He takes the cup from the table. MARY. What say'st thou, Melvil? Yea, I comprehend thee. No priest, no Church, no sacrament is here; Yet hath my Saviour spoken itââWhen two Or three are gather'd in My name together, There am I in the midst.â The Lord hath said it. What matters, then, the priest, to the pure heart, And to th'unspotted soul! Be thou to me, Though unordain'd a priest, God's messenger, Bringing me peace; to thee will I confess Myself of all my sins, and from thy lips Will I receive my latest absolution. MELVIL. Since thus thy soul, mightily urged, doth urge thee, Know, queen, that to thy comfort God hath wrought Another wonder. No priest, no Church is here, No sacrament say'st thou? Yea, but the Priest And Sacrificial God are present here. [He uncovers his head, and shows the tonsure, and also discovers the holy wafer in a golden casket. I am a consecrated priest: to hear Thy last confession, and on death's drear path To bring thee peace, have I upon my head Received the sevenfold sign; and this blest breadâ By the Holy Father blestâI bring to thee. MARY. Oh, even on the threshold of grim death I meet a heavenly joy prepared for me! Hither th'immortal minister descends On golden cloudsâas erst the glorious angel Who set the Apostle from his fetters free! Him can no bolt oppose, no gaoler's sword; Through close-barr'd portals in his might he walks, And 'mid the deepest dungeon darkness shines. Even so hath Heaven's messenger surprised me, By every earthly friend left and betray'd; And thou, my servant once, art now become Servant of the living God, who speaks through thee. As wont thy knees of yore to bend to me, So in the dust I now to thee bow down. [She falls on her knees. MELVIL (making the sign of the cross over her). In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! Queen Mary, hast thou search'd thy heart? Swear'st thou The truth to utter to the God of truth? MARY. My heart lies open before thee and Him. MELVIL. Speak, what offence doth conscience point to thee Unreconciled since thou didst last confess? MARY. My heart hath been brim full of cankerous hate; Fierce thoughts of vengeance in my breast have burn'd; For God's forgiveness, sinner! I dared hope, And could not mine own fellow-sinner pardon. MELVIL. Dost thou repent this sin? Art thou resolved In charity with all to leave this earth? MARY. Yea, as I hope by God to be forgiven. MELVIL. What other sin cries from thy heart against thee? MARY. Ah, not through hate alone, through sinful love Have I offended even yet more deeply. My foolish heart was riveted to one Who hath betray'd and utterly forsaken me. MELVIL. Dost thou repent this sin, and is thy heart Turn'd from its idol-worship back to God? MARY. Harder than all the rest, that strife is over, And riven in twain is this last earthly tie. MELVIL. What more against thee doth thy conscience witness? MARY. An early stain of blood, long since absolved, Rises again to fill me with new terrors; Now in this hour of supreme reckoning The murky shadow darkens Heaven's doorsâ The king, my husband, gave I up to murder, And paid th'assassin with my heart and hand; Sorely with holiest rites I made atonement, But in my soul th'undying worm still gnaws. MELVIL. Does thy heart challenge thee for other sins Not yet confess'd by thee, not yet absolved? MARY. Thou knowest allâthou hast my soul's whole burthen. MELVIL. To the Omniscient think how near thou art; Think of the sentence of our holy Church Against untrue confessionâthat it is The sin to everlasting doom decreed, The awful sin against the Holy Ghost. MARY. So may the Everlasting mercy grant me Victory in death as I have kept back nothing. MELVIL. How! wilt thou, then, deny to God the crime For which the wrath of man is wreak'd upon thee? Nought hast thou utter'd of thy partnership In Babington's and Parry's bloody treason? For this must thou abide thine earthly death; But wilt thou dare for this thy death eternal? MARY. Lo, I am ready for eternity; Though I should stand before God's judgment seat Before the minute hand moved on the dial, Still have I nought to say butâall is said. MELVIL. Beware! the heart is desperately deceitful; Hast thou not with a cunning double drift Forborne to utter words that might condemn thee, While in thy soul thou didst partake the guilt? But be thou sure no craft can now conceal Thy inmost thoughts from the searching eye of Heaven. MARY. All Europe's sovereigns have I call'd upon To set me free from these unworthy fetters; But never, or by word or deed, have I Aim'd at the life of her, mine enemy. MELVIL. Thy secretary, then, hath borne false witness? MARY. What I have said is trueâwhat he has sworn Be God the judge of! MELVIL. Then thou goest hence Firm in thine innocence, to mount the scaffold. MARY. God grant me grace that this unmerited doom May atone the heavy blood-guilt of my youth. MELVIL. Depart in peace, and, dying, be thou purified! Fall at the altar a self-offer'd sacrifice! Blood may atone the guilt of blood-shedding; Womanly frailty hath undone thee here, But in the everlasting realms of light No mortal stain clings to the blessed spirit. Strong in the strength that is bestow'd on me To bind and to unloose, I here pronounce Of all thy sins the plenary absolution; Be it unto thee according to thy faith. [He gives her the wafer. Take, eat this body offer'd up for theeâ [He takes the cup of wine from the table, and offers it to her; she hesitates, and waves it from her. Take, drink this blood that has been shed for theeâ Take it; the pope allows thee this great favour, In death shalt thou enjoy the highest privilege Of kings, the holy priesthood's special right. [She drinks from the cup. And as thou now in this thy earthly body, Mysteriously art to thy God united, So mayst thou in the realms of heav'nly joy, Where is no guilt, nor any weeping more, A fair and glorious angel be united To the bless'd host of the redeem'd for ever! [He sets down the cup. A noise is heard without. Melvil covers his head and goes to the door; while Mary remains on her knees absorbed in prayer. MELVIL. A struggle sharp and fierce awaits thee yet; Hast thou the strength to conquer every throb Of bitterness and hatred? MARY. I fear nothing: My love and hate are offer'd up to God. MELVIL. Be ready to receive the Lords of Leicester And Burleigh; they are at hand. [Enter Leicester, Burleigh, and Paulet; the first remains in the background with his eyes cast down; Burleigh, who observes his demeanour, advances between him and the queen. BURLEIGH. I am come, Lady Stuart, To receive your last commands. MARY. My lord, I thank you. BURLEIGH. It is the will of our gracious queen, that nothing Within the scope of reason be denied you. MARY. My will contains my latest wishes; that I have committed to Sir Amias Paulet; I trust it will be faithfully fulfill'd. PAULET. Be sure it shall. MARY. I beg that all my servants Be left in freedom to return to Scotland, Or else to France, as they themselves desire. BURLEIGH. That shall be as you wish. MARY. And since my body Must not be laid in consecrated ground, Let these my faithful followers be allow'd To bear my heart to France, to my own kindred. Ah, it dwelt ever there! BURLEIGH. It shall be done: Have you bethought youâ MARY. To the queen of England, Carry a sister's greeting from meâfor my death Tell her I do forgive her heartily, And for my passionate words of yesterday Heartily beg her pardon. God preserve her! And send her happily to reign! BURLEIGH. Have you, madam, Bethought you better of the chaplain's presence? MARY. I have made my peace with heaven. Sir Amias Paulet, Innocently I have caused you heavy grief, And robb'd you of the prop of your old age; Oh, let me hope you will not curse my memory! PAULET (gives her his hand). May God be with you, and go hence in peace! [Hannah Kennedy, and the queen's women rush in with signs of terror; they are followed by the Sheriff with his wand of office; a guard of armed men is seen through the open door. MARY. What ails thee, Hannah? ayâeven soâis't time? The sheriff comes to marshal me to death; And it must be fulfill'dâfarewell! farewell! [The women cling round her with passionate grief. MARY (to MELVIL). Most worthy sir, you and my truest Hannah Will keep me company unto the end; My lord, you'll not deny me this poor comfort. BURLEIGH. I have no power to grant it. MARY. How, my lord! Have you power to refuse so small a boon? Show some respect to my sex at least; by whom Is the last service to be render'd me? Never can it be my sister's will in me To outrage womanhood, by suffering That the coarse hands of men should touch my person. BURLEIGH. It may not be; no woman can ascend The scaffold with you; with her tears and criesâ MARY. She shall not weep: I will myself be surety For the stedfast courage of my truest Hannah. Be merciful, my lord, and do not now Separate me from my faithful nurse; Into her arms she first received my life, Let her kind tender hand lead me to death. PAULET. Oh, let it be! BURLEIGH. So be it! MARY. In this world Nothing remains. (Kissing the crucifix)âMy Saviour! my Redeemer! As once thine arms were stretched upon the cross, Open them wide in mercy to receive me! [She turns to go, and suddenly perceives the Earl of Leicester; she trembles, her knees give way, and she is about to sink to the earth; Leicester catches her and supports her in his arms; she looks at him in silence; he turns his eyes away; at length she speaks. MARY. You keep your word, Lord Leicester; you did promise Your arm should lead me from this prison forthâ And in my need you lend it to me now. [He seems annihilated; she proceeds in a gentle tone. Yes, Leicester, and it was not freedom only I thought to owe thee; it was freedom, dear Because thy gift; 'twas life, rich with thy love. Now that I am upon my way to heaven A blessed spirit to become, who never By earthly love can be again assail'd, I can confess the weakness that is conquer'd. My cheeks, already pale with the cold wind, That blows upon them from my open grave, Shall not grow red to tell thee how I've loved thee. Farewell! and if thou canst, mayst thou be happy! It was thy fate to choose between two queens: A tender, loving heart hast thou betray'd And lost, to win a hard and haughty one. Kneel at the footstool of Elizabeth, May thy reward not prove thy chastisement! Farewell! the bitterness of death is past! [She goes out, preceded by the Sheriff, and supported by Melvil and Hannah; Burleigh and Paulet follow; the others remain weeping and watching her till she is out of sight, they then disperse through the side doors. LEICESTER (alone). And yet I live! I can endure to live! This roof above my head falls not to crush me. No yawning chasm opens itself in the earth To swallow the most loathsome wretch upon it. What have I done! What precious pearl of price Have I flung from me! What pure heavenly bliss Have I juggled with and lost. She goesâshe goes, A sainted soul to peace, and I remain With the despairing anguish of the damn'd! Where is the firm resolve that I brought hither To stifle the heart's low wail of love and pity, And see her head fall with unwinking eyes? Her glance of light quickens my dead remorse, And even in death she winds me in love's fetters. O fool! 'tis not for theeâ'tis no more time To melt away in soft and womanish pity. The bliss of love blooms not upon thy path; In iron harness triple case thy breast, And be thy forehead like a rock of brass, If thou wouldst not the guerdon of thy baseness Even now let slip. Fulfill thy appointed task; Strangle this puling grief. With eyes of stone Look on her death. I willâI will behold itâ [He goes with determined steps towards the door through which Mary had passed, but stops halfway. In vainâin vain! Hell's terrors seize upon me. I cannot look upon that hideous spectacle. I cannot see her die. Hark! what was that? They are already there; beneath my feet The bloody work of slaughter is prepared; I hear their voicesâhence, away! away! Forth from this house of horror and of death! [He rushes to one of the doors and finds it fastened; he returns. My feet are riveted to this fatal floor. What! must I hear that which I dare not see! The chaplain's voice! he is exhorting her. She interrupts himâhark! she prays aloud With stedfast voiceâall 's still againâall 's still. Sobbing alone I hear, and woman's wailing. She is disrobed. Hark! now they roll away Her seat, she kneels upon the cushion, and bows Her headâ [After speaking the last words with increasing emotion, he remains breathless for a moment; then suddenly, with a shudder of horror, he starts and falls fainting on the ground. A prolonged confused acclamation of voices is heard from below. Scene 2. The same chamber in the Palace as in the Fourth Act. Enter by a side door Elizabeth, whose countenance and gestures betray the utmost disturbance. ELIZABETH. Yet no one here! No oneâwhen comes the evening! The sun stands still on the highway of heaven, And I must yet lie stretch'd upon the rack. Is't done?âor not? I dare not askâthe yea And nay fill me alike with terror. Leicester Comes not, and Burleigh tarries too. They had Command to see fulfill'd the utmost sentence. If they are gone from London it is done. The shaft is spedâit fliesâit has struck home! Not for my kingdom can I longer hold. Who's there? [Enter a Page. ELIZABETH. Art thou return'd alone? Where are the lords? PAGE. My Lord of Leicester and the Lord High Treasurerâ ELIZABETH. (breathless). Where are they? PAGE. Not in London, madam. ELIZABETH. Gone! Where are they gone? PAGE. No one could tell me, madam. Before the day dawn'd, suddenly and secretly, They left the city. ELIZABETH (exclaims suddenly). I am Queen of England! [She walks up and down in extreme agitation. Go call to meânoâstayâshe's dead at last! And I have room to live upon the earth! Why do I shake? why does this terror clutch me? The grave holds all my fear, and who dare say I did it? Tears! she shall have tears enough; An ocean of them. Why art thou standing there? Bid hither instantly my secretary Davidson; send for Lord Shrewsburyâhe's here! [Exit Page. Enter Shrewsbury. ELIZABETH. Welcome, my noble lord! what brings you hither At this late hour? It must be weighty matterâ SHREWSBURY. Great queen! my careful heart, troubled for your fame, Drove me to-day to the Tower, where Kurl and Nau, The secretaries of Mary Stuart, lie. Once more I sought their testimony's truth To sift. Amazed and much unwillingly, The Lieutenant of the Tower admitted me, But only did so upon sternest threats. God, what a fearful sight there met my eyes! With wild disorder'd hair and maniac glances, Like one possess'd by the furies, on his bed The Scotchman Kurl lay prone; hardly the wretch Beheld and knew me, ere upon the earth He grovell'd at my feet, embraced my knees Like a writhing worm, and shrieking in despair Adjured me to make known to him the fate Of the Queen of Scots, his mistress; for a rumour That she was doom'd to death had made its way Into those iron walls. I told him 'twas the truth, And that she died upon his witness 'gainst her; Whereat he sprung up foaming, and falling on His wretched fellow-prisoner hurl'd him down To the earth, with all the giant strength of madness, Striving to strangle him. We hardly tore The miserable creature from his gripe, When 'gainst himself his fury turn'd; he smote His breast with his clench'd hands, and cursed himself, And all the company of the fiends of hell. He has borne false witness, and the fatal letter Written to Babington, to which he swore, Was forged; he did himself write down the words Other than those the queen did bid him write, And urged the wretched Nau to the like villany. These things confess'd, he flung the window wide With furious force, and call'd aloud in the street, Down to the throng, who gathering ran together That he was Mary's secretaryâthe wretch Who wrongly had accused herâthe accurs'd False witness! ELIZABETH. Nay, but he was mad, indeed! The words of a raving madman can prove nothing. SHREWSBURY. The madman's madness though proves all the more; O madam, I implore you without delay, Give order for a new examination. ELIZABETH. I will do so, my lord, at your request, Not that I may believe that overhastily My peers have judged this matter; but for you, And the quieting of your mind, let there be given Order for a new examination: 'tis well There yet is time for it! on our kingly honour No shadow of a doubt shall linger; nowâ [Enter Davison. The sentence that I gave into your hand, Where is it? DAVISON (in the greatest amazement). The sentence! ELIZABETH. Ay, that I gave Yesterday to your keeping. DAVISON. To my keeping? ELIZABETH. The people clamour'd for the signing of it, And to their will compell'd to yield, I sign'd it, By them urged to the deed; and to your hand I gave the paper, meaning to give some respite Of time, as I told you then; now give it! SHREWSBURY. Good sir, deliver it; things are much alter'd; A new examination must be held. ELIZABETH. Dream not so long about it; where's the sentence? DAVISON. I'm breathless with amazement and dismay! ELIZABETH (hastily). Now I well hope, sirâ DAVISON. I am ruin'd, lost! I have it not. ELIZABETH. How! what! SHREWSBURY. Great God in heaven! DAVISON. Since yesterday, Lord Burleigh has possess'd it. ELIZABETH. Wretch! is it thus thou hast obey'd my words? Did I not bid thee hold it for thy life. DAVISON. That was not your command, madam! ELIZABETH. How, villain! Wilt thou gainsay me, reptile that thou art? When did I bid thee give it to Lord Burleigh? DAVISON. Not in those very wordsânot clearlyâbutâ ELIZABETH. Villainous slave! hast thou dared make my word Of thy own bloody thought interpreter? Woe be to thee if evil has befallen From this thy self-usurp'd authority! Thy life shall pay for it! My Lord of Shrewsbury, You see how my name is palter'd with. SHREWSBURY. I seeâO Heav'n! ELIZABETH. Say you? SHREWSBURY. If Master Davison Has done this deed upon his own allowance And risk, without your knowledge or consent, He must before the high court of the peers Be straight arraign'd, and to all future time His name be given up to execration. [Enter Burleigh, who kneels to the queen. BURLEIGH. Long live my sovereign queen and mistress! May The enemies of these island realms all fall Like Mary Stuart! [Shrewsbury covers his face; Davison wrings his hands despairingly. ELIZABETH. My Lord Burleigh Had you received command of death from me? BURLEIGH. No, royal madam, but from Davison. ELIZABETH. In my name did he give it? in my name? BURLEIGH. No, my dread lady, butâ ELIZABETH. And you have dared To do this deed without our will being known. The sentence was a righteous one, the world Dare wag no tongue against it; but for you, Who have thrust yourself between it and our mercy, We forthwith from our presence banish you. (To Davison.) For this fellow, a sharper doom remains, Who boldly daring to o'erstep his duty, A holy trust has ventured to betray. To the Tower with him! he shall stand his trial For life and all he is possessed of! Noble Talbot, Thouâthou alone of all my counsellors Have I found honest; henceforth thou shalt be My friend and guide! SHREWSBURY. Nay, madam, drive not from you These your true friends; cast not in prison those Who have wrought for you, and are silent now For your sake only. But for me, great queen! Give leave that I return into your keeping The seal, which for twelve years you have trusted to me. ELIZABETH. Shrewsbury, thou wilt not at this hour forsake me? SHREWSBURY. Forgive me, madam! I am grown too old, And this right hand might prove too stiff, I fear, To seal your latest deeds of sovereignty. ELIZABETH. So he that saved my life abandons me. SHREWSBURY. 'Tis little I have done; your nobler life I could not save; live, and reign happily! Your foe is dead, you have no more to fear, Nor further need to use dissimulation. [Enter the Earl of Kent. ELIZABETH. Call hither the Earl of Leicester! KENT. Madam, The earl has suddenly taken ship for France. END OF âMARY STUART.</field>
