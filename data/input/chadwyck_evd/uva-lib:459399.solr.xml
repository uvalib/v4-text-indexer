      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus Scena prima. Enter Lamot and Dumaine like Souldiers. Dum. We are not safe Lamot; this bawdie peace Begets a war within me; our swords worn For Ornament, not use; the Drum &amp; Trumpet Sing drunken Carrols, and the Canon speaks Health, not confusion; Helmets turn'd to Cups; Our bruised Armes administer discourse For Tables and for Taverns, where the Souldier Oft finds a pitty, not reliefe: I'l tell thee, Wee'r walking images, the signes of men, And bear about us nothing but the forme Of man that's manly. Lam. Wee'r cold indeed. Dum. Yes, and th'ungratefull time As coldly doth reward us, all our actions, Attempts of valour, look'd into with eyes Fil'd with contempt, when ye Gods ye know It is our gifts they see yet: oh I am mad! The very bread that lends them life to scorn us, Our blood ha's paid for, yet demand a bit, Or ask of this old satten belli'd sir, Or Madam toothless with her velvet sconce, And you shall hear their rotten lungs pronounce The Whip and Whip-stock. Lam. Prethee containe thy selfe. Dum. Thou knowest I can; With what an equall temper did I breath Under the frozen climate of the North, Where in mine armes (the sheets of war) I slept, My bed being feather'd with the down of heaven? I have lain down a man and rise a snow-ball. There these have been my pastimes, which i've born As willingly as I received them nobly. The Queenes black envy which doth still remaine, And peeps through every limb she bears about her, Fated to ruine us, does not swell my Gall, No nor this willing beggery I weare To cloud me from her malice; by the Gods This bastard-getting peace unspirits me, A greater corrasive to my active soul, Than all past ills what ever. Lam. As you are valiant be wise too, this is no time To vent your passions like a woman in, Your sword, not tongue, should speak. Dum. You are an expert Tutor, and I thank you; Our wrongs would add a spirit to the dead, And make them fight our quarrels;âbut look here Enter Landrey, and two or three insinuating Lords, busie in conference, and three or foure Petitioners. The minion of our Queen, oh what a traine The painted Peacock bears! death, were I Jove But onely for this Giant. Peti. Good your honor, our wives and Children, Good your honour hear us. Lan. Where are our slaves? keep off these dregs of men, The scum and out-cast of the world; bring round my chariot To the postern Gate; these bell-mouth'd Rascals Split mine eares with noise, make hast before Lest my great Mistress wait my comming. Exit. Peti. Good your honour. [Exeunt. 1 Peti. The devill take your worship; we must follow. Dum. These are the fruits of base upstarts and flatterers. Tell me Lamot, can this same Merchpane man Think, or commit a sin though ne'r so horrid, But it is candied o'r, and from his vice Excessive praise and plaudites arise? Were I the King, but he is wilful blind, And by the hornes she rocks him fast asleep, Before the wanton and hot-blooded Queene Should have the licence but to be suspected With such a Knight of Ginger-bread as this, A gilded flesh-flie, I would lock her up, Yea chain the evill Angel in a Box, And house her like a silk-worme. Lam. Pardon me sir, the good old King's unable. Dum. And therefore must admit an upstart Page, Now rais'd to honours by her lawless lust, Maior of the Palace, and the Duke of France, The next stept is the Crown; now by my life 'Twere good the King would execute them both. Lam. Alas he dares not, for the no chast Queene, Is as her birth, as great in faction, Followed and sainted by the multitude, Whose judgement she hath linck'd unto her Purse, And rather bought a love than found it: She ha's a working spirit, an active braine, Apt to conceive, and wary in her wiles; Besides, her Sons, the pillowes of the State, Support her like an Atlas, where she sits, And like the heavens commands our fates beneath her; She is the greater light, the King a star That onely glares but through her influence. A florish within, Dum. Hark, the thunder of the world, how out of tune, This peace corrupting all things makes them speak, What means this most adulterate noise? Lam. Why, are you ignorant? This is a night of jubile, and the King Solemnly feasts for his wars happie successe, Besides his Sons and he are knit againe; We shall have Masks and Revelling to night. Dum. Now the great Gods confound this pickthanck noise, The Drums and Trumpets are turn'd flatterers, And Mars himself a Bawd to grace their riot. O I am mad, this grates my very Gall. Lam. What man, bear up; Although I wish all civill discord hence, Yet I do hope a time wherein we Souldiers, Shall like a moving wall of living steel, Defend this City that offends us now. Dum. My thoughts keep not your road, I think. The devilish spirit of the haughty Queen, Will find imployment for us yet, her brain Is very active in exploits that breed The Souldiers harvest, war and dissention. Enter the Eunuch with bags of Gold, gives to each of them one, and after a little pause departs. Lam. What vision's this? 'tis Gold right and fair, Sure I dreame not. Dum. I cannot tell, but he that takes this from me, Shall soon perceive I do not sleep nor slumber. Lam. It was the Eunuch. Dum. That needs no deciding. Lam. What speaks the Paper left behind? If it be Chorus to this dum shew, read it Dumaine. The Letter. As you are Souldiers truly valiant, I honor you, as poor, I pitty you; therefore have sent you that wil render you as compleat Courtiers, as undaunted Souldiers: we know your present fortunes shame your parentage, which was not onely great in it self, but fortunate in so fair an off-spring: Dumaine, Lamot, let it suffice we know ye; for our eye is every where: whilst I remember your worths, I shall forget your parents injuries; feare nothing, for your hitherto concealement, i'l get your pardons, and whilst I breath, breath your kind Mistress: if you dare trust me, appear at Court to night so adorned, as shall become your honours, our friends. Fredigond. Lamot. The Queene? Dum. We are betraid Lamot, what shall we do? Lam. Wee'l take the gracious proffer of the Queene, Shee's princely vow'd our friend; besides what ill Can we expect from her, who might have sent Her murdering ministers and slaine us here, If she intended foul play? but she's noble. Dum. Noble, grant her so, yetâ Lam. What yet? Dum. Her murdred Brothers memory.â Lam. When he fell, we were too young for traytors. Dum. But not for torments, had we been apprehended; For in the high displeasure of the Queen, All our posterity was doom'd, some felt the wheel, Some wrack'd, some hang'd, others impal'd on stakes, With divers strange and horrid formes of death, That you'd have thought, and fitly thought it too, That all the torments which the Poets feign The damned spirits exercise in Hell, Had here been put in execution; And had not we been then in Witenburge, Beyond the fury of her mortall spleen, We had added to the number of the dead; Then think you still we shall not? Lam. Now by my life it's murder to suspect her, Our lives are all that we can lose, our fame, Not time nor Art can murder, so wee'l venture. Exeunt omnes. Scena II. Enter Fredigond the Queene, and the Eunuch. Qu. What conference did they maintain with thee? Eu. None farther than the language of their eyes, They look'd on me as if they ment me thanks, Which their amazement rob'd me off. Qu. Spake they not then at all? Eu. No not a word, They seem'd to me as if they knew no language. Qu. You know them not? Eu. No dearest Lady, for th'appear'd to me Like to the silent postures in the Arras, Onely the form of men with stranger faces. Qu. Take u'm then, they are our enemies, Whom I have angled with that golden bait; Their parents waded in my Brothers blood, For which i'l be reveng'd of all their kin, Could they increase as oft as I would kill, I'd ever kill that they might still increase: Draw the curtain and shew the picture. This picture drawn by an Italian (Which still I keep to whet mine anger) Does represent the murder of my brother, For ravishing this beautious piece of ill; A bloody and a terrible mistake, To murder Clodimir for Clotarrs fact, For which behold how Fredigond's reveng'd, This old Dumaine and father to this maid, With all his kindred, sociates and alies, (These brace of wicked ones, and that ravisht whore, The fair and fatall cause of these events Onely excepted) are here, here in this picture: Is't not a brave sight, how doth the object like thee? How prettily that babie hangs by th'heels, Sprawling his Armes about his mothers wombe, As if againe he sought for shelter there? Here's one bereft of hands, and this of tongue, Finger thy Lute Maria, sing out Isabel: ScopticÃ¨. Hark, hark Castrato, the musick of the SphÃ¦res, O ravishing touch, hark how the others voice Ecchoes the Lute, Is't not a divine softnesse? Ha ah ha, I do expect they now should rayle extremely; I prethee scold at me good Isabel, A little of the woman; no Maria; Within the cloathed circle of mine eyes, Anchor thy fingers, alas, thy nailes are par'd, Nor has poor Isabel a tongue to scold with, And here's the Granddam with her glares out; Saddle her nose with spectacles, or else Shee'l miss her way to the infernall pit. Tow horie Gray-berds in this angle lyes, Will find their way to Hell without their eyes, Villaines that kil'd my Brother; how does this like thee? To execute men in picture, is't not rare? (Stabs the picture Eu. Were but Chrotilda here, and these two youngsters, It were a pastime for the Gods to gaze on. Oh were I but a man as others are, As kind and open-handed nature made me, With Organs apt and fit for womans service. Qu. What if thou wert? Eu. What if I were great Queene? I'd search the Deserts, Mountaines, Vallies, Plaines, Till I had met Chrotilda, whom by force I'd make to mingle with these sootie limbs, Till I had got on her one like to me, Whom I would nourish for the Dumaine line; That time to come might story to the world, They had the Devil to their Grand-father. Qu. I find thee Eunuch apt for my imployments, Therefore I will unclaspe my soul to thee, I've alwaies found thee trusty, and I love thee. Eu. With thanks I ever must acknowledge it, And lay my life at my great Mistress feet, Kneels. To spend it when she pleases. Qu. We need it not As yet Castrato, but we may hereafter. See, their's the plat-forme of great Childricks death; And they which must be thought his murderers, Our Enemies, and now new Courtiers, Whom hitherto I have reserv'd for policy; First, that they take away the guilt from us; Next, being apprehended, studying deaths, The heads of all our Engineers shall sit T'invent unheard of torments for the slaves; I long to see them here, here in this frame, Greeting their kindreds bones. Eu. You are the Goddess of invention. Qu. Then i'l commend thee to my elder Son, Where thou shalt wind into his secret thoughts; As for the younger Boy let me alone; And when we have them on the hip, they shall Follow their Fathers unto Hells-black-Hall Eu. Still better. Qu. Will not this be brave? ha, how lik'st thou this? Now by this light I'm taken strangely with thee, Come kiss me, kiss me sirra, tremble not. (Queene kisses him.) Fie, what a January lip thou hast, A paire of Iscicles, sure thou hast bought A paire of cast lips of the chast Diana's, Thy blood's meere snow-broth, kiss me again: (again) Now see if you can find these gallants forth, And bring them to our presence. Exit Eunuch. O sir y'are welcome, Enter Landrey. Your visits have been freer, but I grow old, And you command the beauties of the time. Lan. What means my noble Mistress? think you the blood Runnes so degenerate within these veins, To stoop to an inferiour imbrace, When I injoy the best. Qu. We are betraid: I'l tell thee a good jest Landrey, pray marke; This morning dressing my head my husband came, And with his switch (for he was then to hunt) A gentle stroke he gave me on the back; My fancy busied then to make me fine, Supposing it was you that sported so, (Not dreaming that the dotard was so neere) Cri'd, well my Landrey, in story we still find, The best Knights strike before and not behind: The King who alwaies understood too fast, Quits suddenly my Chamber; what he intends I cannot guess, unless it be our deaths, Which if he speedily perform not, then Know he shall never, for this night concludes him. His Sons I weigh like him, they have rebell'd, And taken spirit of late t'oppose my will, And contradict my pleasures in thy love, For which it is not safe that they should live; The Kingdoms Heir shall be a boy of thine, And Kings and Queens shall follow in thy Line. Eu. Madam, here are the Gentlemen. Enter Dumaine &amp; Lamot very brave, the Eunuch. Qu. Y'are welcome to the Court, and us, brave spirits y'are welcome. Take a Queenes word y'are welcome. Ambo. Your highnesse is as full of grace as mercy. Qu. Rise and follow us, wee'l be your Guardian and Protectres. Lan. What are these? (Aside Qu. Sheep for my shambles, whom I have fatted up Onely for slaughter; things are on foot decreed, Shall make some smile to night, and others bleed. Exeunt omnes Scena III. Enter Clovis at one door, Aphelia and a Page at the other with a Torch. Clo. My best Mistress, What Angel brought you hither? for I know Millions attend your goodness. Aph. My Lord? Clo. Why do you cast such stranger eyes upon me? You were not wont to cloth your browes with scorn, Nor dart such deadly looks; can my mistress Be angry with her servant? my offence, If slowness in my visits, i'l hereafter Grow to your threshold; why weep you now? Trust me divinest fair thine eyes seed pearl, Bracelets for Gods to wear about their armes. Aph.

The ashes in your Urn shall suffer for't, Virgins will sow their curses on your Grave, Time blot your Kingly parentage, and call Your birth in question; do not think This deed will lie conceal'd, the faults Kings do Shine like the fiery Beacons on a hill For all to see, and seeing tremble at: It's not a single ill which you commit; What in the subject is a petty fault, Monsters your actions, and's a foul offence; You give your subjects licence to offend, When you do teach them how.

Clota. Neither shall his without Correction Upon him slaves. Qu. Hold, I command ye hold: Oh Clotair thou art of a valiant soul, And wilt thou basely thus beset thy Brother? Fear argues spirits most degenerate, And that thou fear'st, th'advantage argues it; O set not on thy slaves, if he must die, Let thy sacrifice not butcher him. Clota. That argument sounds harsh, does Clotair fear? Clo. Sacrifice me? it is not in his power. Eu. Exquisite Philter, how it operates! Qu. We hope so Clovis; yet thy brother King Is as an earthly God, his will his law, His power uncircumscrib'd, unlimited, Whose Majesty can look a subject dead. Clo. How? look me dead?

Remove the Corps, withall Convey this Syren from our wandring eyes, And howse her in a Dungeon; let no light Peep through a cranney on her; mask the day, Put the all-searching eyes of PhÃ¦bus out; Lest accidentally he gazing here, Here fix eternally, and so we may Despair of night as once we did of day: Bear her to prison; reason not the cause, A Kings prerogative's above his lawes.

Then understand, Lamot lives still at Court Disguised like a formal Surgion, To whom the Prince being delivered To be embalm'd and boweld, finding life Yet in his Corps, which way he's very skilful, H'as balsomed all his wounds and cur'd him. Lano. And what of all this! Dum. Have temperance, and hear the rest: For this the Prince h'as promis'd him the place, The grand Commander of the Citadel, Whose aid can stead us infinitely. Lano. Is it certain? Dum. I did but even now receive this Letter, (shews the Letter. Which constantly affirms it from himself; He saies it is not known in Court yet, that the Prince lives, For divers reasons best known to themselves; And herein doth require our secrecie, Therefore dear friends be warie to divulge it. Besides he saies here, That the great Monseiur's suppos'd funeral This day's solemnized with greatest pomp; And how Aphelia dies a sacrifice That hour he is buried on his Herse: What if we made attempt to save the Virgin? Lano. It may not be, better she fall alone, Than all of us together. And now best friends Let us behave us bravely, it's no base act We undertake, but our whole Countries freedom From slaverie and bondage; men of worth stand bare To pages and gilt Butterflies? besides the Queen Will grave us all rather than want sport In spilling human blood; come, let's withdraw, And laie the plat-form of this mighty work; My soul sits smiling in me, I divine Though now it lowr, I shall see Sun will shine. Exeunt. Enter Clovis and Lamot both disguised. Clo. Strephon, for so thou nam'st thy self, thou'st made Thy Prince thy subject by thy timely cure; This is the hour I must be buried living; And this the hour the fair Aphelia Dyes on my Herse t'appease my wandring Ghost; Say Strephon, is it so? Lam. Nay this the very minute: hark, I hear them Comming. (sad solemn musick. Clov. Stand close here, wee'l observe the Mourners. Enter six of the Guard, their Halberds reverst, then a Cardinal, Landrey, Old Brissac; then the Herse born by six young men, then King, Queen, Eunuch holding up her train, two or three Ladies, these in mourning: at the other door, a Headsman, two Nuns in white singing, Aphelia with a Garland on her head, led by two little boyes in white; after these, more Virgins adorned like the rest; both Troops passe by each other; the song ended, the Herse is set down between both companies, Aphelia mourning as one end, and the King at the other, who after a little pause speaks. The Song by Nuns. Come blest Virgins come and bring To this Goddess offering, Offer to her kisses, such As make good better by the touch; Where her eyes let fall a tear, Another Paradice springs there; It's prepostrons crueltie To sacrifice a Deitie; If a true path should be trod, To her sacrifice a God. Clot. Set down, set down your honourable load, Fitting an Atlas shoulder; burden of grace And majestie immense, whose weight doth load Heavens stooping Porter, under which he groans More than the SphÃ¦res, and sweats thy weight not theirs; Let me bedew thy Herse with pious tears, Balm to wounds, repenting ones; look down From heaven empire all and behold me stand All flood in sorrow, drown'd in mine own tears; Behold this spotlesse sacrifice, a Virgin As pure in thought as Vesture, an Oblation To ransome Jove and Heaven had he been taken, And so we yeeld her up. (Delivers her to the Headsman. Bris. O my good Lord, This is conspiracie 'gainst an old mans life; Have you no other way to murther me, But to begin with her? are these your plots? You'r weary of my counsell? and my place May better be suppli'd by greener heads? Pray cut off mine, do, do, a weak old man, My absence were material, since your state Requires Paricides about you, Alas I may be spar'd; why must she die? Because she's fair? or that a Prince Once thought her so? the fault is none of hers, Let nature suffer for't; if it prove Art, Or that with plaistred cunning she did catch Your Brothers love with an adulterate form, I yeeld her up as not aly'd to me; If not, why should she suffer? Clot. Brissac, peace. (The King takes the sword from the Executioner. Clov. What pageant's this? Clot. Be it no wonder Lords To see a Prince an Executioner; Far be it from the dignitie of France To let a soul forth so refin'd as her's With mercinary hands. Lam. Contain your self, You may prevent the danger when you please. Clot. Behold the conquest of thine eies Aphelia, (the King kneels, and laies the sword at Aphelia's foot. France at thy foot, tread on his Royaltie; Or if thy nature knows not to forgive, which to believe were impious, take this sword And search my heart, send me a sacrifice T'appease the troubled spirit of thy love. Qu. O Eunuch, that shee'd take him at his word. (aside. Clot. I find a speaking pitty in thine eyes, Which thence will drop upon thy gentle tongue, And cry in peace, Long live my Soveraign. Aphe. Long live Clotair, long live my Soveraign. Clot. The motions of the SphÃ¦res move in that tongue. Turn all your sables to the Tyrian dye, Your dirges into sprightful wedding airs. Why looks our Court so sad? is this a time To anckor your aspects unto the earth? By my blest self, he's traytor to the height, That do's not straight salute her as his Queen. Omnes. Long live Aphelia Queen of France and us. Lamot. Do you hear this? what are you planet-stroken? Clovis, Prince, Monsiure? Qu. What will Clotair do? Clot. What heaven ha's pointed for him, Marrie her. Qu. Thy Grave, thy Grave first Clotair. Clot. Cardinal. (The Cardinal and the King whisper. Qu. What evill spirit's crept into my Son? Venom'd his noble nature, sickned all His wholsome faculties, slain's divinitie? Are these your vowes? or canst thou couzen heaven? Necessity of fate depends on it, You know she must to earth. Clot. I, but not yet: Since she ha's conquer'd me, that could do fate, Had she joyn'd with me, the aw'd destinies Spin her decrees, and what she wills they act; Sith then what must be must be, joyn our hands. Lam. Now, now, prevent them yet, O statue Prince Thou art undone for ever. (The Monsiure stands amaz'd. Clov. Where am I? Awake? for ever rather let me sleep. Is this a funerall? O that I were a Herse, And not the mock of what is pagented. Clot. Amazement quite confounds me, Clovis alive! Lam. Yes sir, by my Art he lives, though his desire Was not to have it known; this Chest contains Nothing but spices sweetly oderiferous. Clot. Into my soul I welcome thee dear brother; This second birth of thine brings me more joy, Than had Aphelia brought me forth an Heir, Whom now you must remember as a Sister. Clo. O that in nature there was left an Art, Could teach me to forget I ever lov'd This her great Masterpiece; O well built frame, Why dost thou harbour such unhallow'd guests To house within thy bosome perjurie? If that our vowes are registred in heaven, Why are they broke on earthâ? Aphelia, This was a hastie match, the subtill air Ha's not yet cool'd the breath, with which thou swor'st Thy self into my soul; and on thy cheeks, The print and path-way of those tears remain That woo'd me to believe so: flie me not, (she gives back. I am no spirit; tast my active pulse, And you shall find it make such harmony. As youth and health enjoy. Eu, The Queen she faints. Clov. Is there a God left so propitious To rid me of my fears; still let her sleep, For if she wake (O King) she will appear Too monstrous a spectre for frail eyes To see and keep their senses. Lam. Are you mad? Clo. Nothing so happy Strephon, would I were; In times first progress I dispair the hour, That brings such fortune with it; I should then Forget that she was ever pleasing to me; I should no more remember she would sit And sing me into dreams of Paradice; Never more hang about her Ivory neck Believing such a one Diana's was, Never more dote she breaths Arabia, Or kiss her Corrall lip into a paleness. Streph. See, she's return'd, and with majestique gaze, In pitty rather than contempt, beholds you. Clov. Convey me hence some charitable man, (admiringly. Lest this same Creature looking like a Saint, Hurry my soul to Hell; she is a fiend Apparel'd like a woman, sent on earth For man's destruction. Clot. Rule your disorder'd tongue; Clovis, what's past we are content to think, It was our brother spoke, and not our subject. Clov. I had forgot my self, yet well remember, Yon Gorgon ha's transform'd me into stone; And since that time my language ha's been harsh, My words too heavie for my tongue, to earthly; I was not born so, trust me Aphelia: Before I was possest with these black thoughts, I could sit by thy side, and rest my head Upon the rising pillows of thy breast, Whose naturall sweetnesse would invite mine eies To sinck in pleasing slumbers, wake, and kisse The Rose beds that afforded me such bliss; But thou art now a generall disease That eat'st into my Marrow, turn'st my blood, And mak'st my veines run poyson, that each sense Groans at the alteration: am I the Monsiure? Do's Clovis talk his sorrows, and not act? O man bewomaniz'd; wert thou not mine, How comes it thou art his? Clot. You have done ill, And must be taught so; you Capitulate Not with your equall Clovis, she's thy Queen. Clov. Upon my knees I do acknowledge her, (he kneels. Queen of my thoughts and my affections. O pardon me, if my ill-tutor'd tongue Ha's forfeited my head; if not, behold Before the sacred altar of thy feet, I lie a willing sacrifie. Aphe. Arise: And henceforth Clovis thus instruct thy soul; There lies a depth in fate, which earthly eies May faintly look into, but cannot fathom; You had my vow till death to be your wife, You being dead my vowes were cancelled, And I as thus you see bestow'd. Clov. Farewell; I will no more offend you: would to God Those cruell hands not enough barbarous, That made these bleeding witnesses of love, Had set an endless period to my life too. Clot. Where there's no help it's bootless to complain; Clovis she's mine; let not your spirit war Or mutiny within you, because I say't; Nor let thy tongue from henceforth dare presume, To say she might, or ever should be thine; What's past once more I pardon, 'tis our wedding day. Clo. A long farewel to love, thus do I break (he breaks the Ring. Your broken pledge of faith; and with this kiss, The last that ever Clovis must print here: Unkiss the kiss that seal'd it on thy lips. Ye powers ye are unjust, for her wild breath That ha's the sacred tie of contract broken, Is still the same Arabia that it was: (the King Clotair pulls him. Nay I have done; beware of jealousie, I would not have you nourish jealous thoughts; Though she ha's broke her faith to me, to you Against her reputation shee'l be true: Farewel my first love lost, i'l chuse to have No wife, till death shall wed me to my Grave. Come Strephon, come and teach me how to die, That gav'st me life so unadvisedly. (Ex. Clovis &amp; Streph. Clot. Let Clovis that way go, this way will we, He's great with grief, we with felicity.

If (in her proud desire) I do prevent Her lust this second time, before the third She may repent and save her loathed soul, Which my revenge would damn; yet were she crost, Her lust being now at full flood in her, And no way left to quench her burning flame, Her dryer bones would make a bonfire, Fit for the Devill to warm his hands by: Stay, stay, Castrato; no, this must not be, Nor must the high and mighty Queen Aphelia This night enjoy her Bridegroom, I must set Some mischief instantly on foot to stop it; If I miscarry in it story shall tell, I did attempt it bravely though I fell.

For I can counterfeit Aphelia's hand; The King ha's banish'd Landrey from the Court, Because he wore the Jewel which he sent To his Aphelia: light suspitions, But this shall aggravte; find thou the King, Shew him this Note, it doth expresse great love To Landrey from Aphelia; and withall, It mentioneth the Jewel as a Gift To gratifie her servant; this to the rest Of poyson he ha's suck'd already in, Will so inflame him, that the Court shall burn Too hot for his Aphelia.

Thou'dst have me joyn my self unto the Rebels, And with my person grace their cause, perhaps That is not now to plot. Eu. I find you high, Worthy the name of Monsieure; yet your thoughts Hit not my purpose, it is such that made Your Brother quake to hear. Clo. What is it Eunuch?

All that's behind I can perform my self, Without this complement. 1 Lady. Sweet Lady, You must not weigh these things so deeply, Your Lord is of a noble spirit; And you shall see how calm he will return, Blessing your Bridall bed with fruitfull issue. Aphe. No, no; The Safforn-coated Hymen frowns upon us, These Tapers here were lighted at a pile, As sit Attendants on the Grave, not Bed; Juno denyes her presence at this match, And all the ill presaging birds of night Sing fatall Requiems for a Bridall Song; O Ladyes, is not this ominous? Clot. Yes my Aphelia, if that ragged fate Lie in a kiss, then it is ominous. Let me dwell here; I am ravisht, Am I on earth? no, heaven is here, And all th'unimitable joyes, that Poets feign, Are better'd in thy goodnesse. Aphe.

O Childrick I confesse 'twas I that kill'd thee, These hands administred the fatal draught That set thy soul on wing. Clov. What do I hear? Qu. Oh do not snatch my soul from out this world, Till I have bath'd it in repentant tears, And made it fit for heaven. Clov. She faints again; (he puts off his robes. Who waits within? come forth and lend your aid: (Enter Lamot at the trap door. O welcome Strephon; use thy best of skill That masters nature, and doth life restore, Beyond the Art of Ãseulapius; Apply thy gentlest med'cines. (Enter Musicians. Lam. Let us withdraw; My life sir answer hers if she miscarry. Clov. What are ye? Musi. Musicianes, whose obedience Doth here attend the Queen. Clov. Bawds, arrant-bawds; I'l talk with you anon; in, in. (Exeunt omnes. Enter the Guard. 1 Gua. Stand close, stand close, I heard a busling within here while. 2 Gua Busling, and they come this way here's that shall bussle them. (Enter Landrey. 3 Gua. Fly upon him, hee's drunk, and will betray us all. Land. I am betraid, tht Monsiure seeks my life, All waies 'gainst m'escape are fortifi'd; O cruel fortune bawd to time and fate, That sooth'st us up to make us ruinate: For now thou know'st no tears, anon no glee, But onely constant in inconstancie.

The Devil, what a Devil care I, keep off Devil, I say keep off, I do not fear thee; are you Sneaking back, you cowardly Rogue, d'ee budge; I hate a cowardly rogue, as I hate, as I hate the Devil; take that. (knocks him down. Land. Oh, oh, oh. 2 Guar. Oh, oh, oh, i'l make you cry oh; What Devil made you in my way? I'l now see what money he carries about him; Men say the Prince of darknesse is a Gentleman, By'rladie he ha's good clothes; but yet for all that He may have no money. Enter Queen, Clovis, Lamot undisguised, Musicians. Qu. I know not were he is, or if I did, Before i'd yeeld him up to thy revenge, I'l die ten thousand deaths. Clov. Thou glorious light, that in thy naturall Orb Didst comfortably shine upon this Kingdome; How is thy worth ecclips'd, what a dull darkness Hangs round about thy fame? in all this piece, To every limb whereof I once ow'd dutie, I know not where now to find out my mother. Qu. The Devil and disobedience blinds your eyes. Clov. O that I had no eyes, so you no shame; Murther your Husband to arrive at lust, And then to lay the blame on innocents? Blush, I lush, thou worse than woman. Qu. Ha, ha, ha. Clov. Hold my heart, You'r impudent in sin; has your proud page Made you thus valiant? tell me, where he is; For if you dally with me, know this hand Shall rip him from thy heart, though Cabin'd there. Qu. How dar'st thou cloth thy speech in such a phrase To me thy naturall Mother? Clov. My Mother! Adulterate woman, shame of Royaltie, I blush to call thee mother; thy foul lusts Have taught me words of that harsh consequence That Stigmatize obedience, and do brand With mis-becoming accents filiall duty: Deliver quickly where this leacher is; Here hous'd he must be, for he cannot scape, Lest wildness conquering my softer sense, Thrust forth my hand into an act of horror, And leave you breathlesse here. Q. What French Neronian spirit have we here? Insolent boy, wilt thou turn Paricide? Clov. The justness of my cause would excuse me If I should execute; speak murtheress, Where have you mew'd your Monster? Qu. Here lies the Monster, oh rare Monster; two Berds, This is a comick Monster; a Periwick too, this is a Court Monster; D'ee gape, what in the Devils name would you beg now? Lam. Behold my Lord, the Woodcock's in the Gin, Here lies the great Landrey. Qu. O horrid sin. Clov. This habit might have ruin'd all Lamot. But Goblin now you are caught; what is he dead? Lam. Scarce hurt my Lord; how is't? look up. Eu. Where is the Queen? (Enter Eunuch. Qu. Here Eunuch, as thou fee'st, in misery. Eu. O my heart, how came the Monsiur hither? Lamot too? Qu. All that I know is that we are betraid. Eu. I'l set them packing, fear not,âmy good Lord. Clov. Thou art a faithful servant. Eu. Sir, the Rebelsâ Clov. Give 'hem a nobler Title, by my life I do applaud their courage; come they on? Eu. Yes, and Brissac is made their Generall. Clov. A hopeful youth, fraught with Nobility, And all the graceful qualities that write Man truly honourable; my injuries Have swell'd me up to this. Eu. His Father's dead. Clov. Trust me i'm sorry, grief has broke his heart, And mine Castrato too; canst thou imagine Who was the Author of our Fathers death? Eu. Am I betraid? then lend me impudence, I'm sure I cannot blush: Royal sir, whom? Clov. Our Mother with Landrey, and this Lamot, They ment should bear the blame; this was Strephon. Eu. Indeed?âwould I were fairly off. Clov. But what news with Aphelia and her Bridegroom? Eu. As you could wish, hee's lull of jealousie, No Frenchman e'r was more Italian; I've wrought him bravely on, your Physick works, Hither i've brought Aphelia; to morrow You shall hear further sport i'l warrant you; In the mean while, what will you do with these? Clov. Castrato thus; Nature forbids me spill my Mothers blood, And Landrey is unfit for my revenge; For I must study torments for the slave, Therefore I give them up to your tuition, Until I shall return victorious. Qu. Observ'd you that? there is some comfort yet. Clov. Then wee'l determine of them, if we fall Let Clotair point them out a funerall: Reward these with the whip, these with my purse, His merit is two hundred Crowns, perform it 2. Guard. Drink, I adore thee drink; good fellows all, Sometimes we rise by drink, but oftner fall. (Ex. 2 Guard. Clov. A moral drunkard, go away with them; (Ex. Eunuch, Musicians, Landry &amp; Queen. And on your life let them not stir from hence. Now my revenge grows to maturity, Wee'l to Dumain (Lamot) and joyn with him; Now France thou liest a bleeding, thou shalt prove What 'tis to cross the Monsiur in his love. (Exeunt omnes.</field>

Enter the Eunuch, whilst the waits play softly, and solemnly drawes the Canopie, where the Queen sits at one end bound with Landrey at the other, both as asleep. Eu. Here sits our Beldam dieted for Venerie, And by her, her Landrey not surfeited; Her Ladyship's allou'd a mouldie crust, He stinking water to peece out his life, Between them both they banquet like one slave, Condemn'd perpetually to the Burdello; They think I know not that they thus are us'd, When it is onely I that use them thus. How wickedly they look, oh I could laugh To hear them rail at others misery; He curses her, and she sooth curses him, And both each other damn for their offences. Learn ye that pamper up your flesh for lust, The Eunuch in his wickedness is just. Play louder, they sleep too long. Qu. A mischief take thee keeper, hardned dog, Whom no distress can melt or mollifie; The cruell King doth not deny us sleep, Although the Nursers of it, food and ease. Eu. Peace, peace, ye villains cease that ruder noise That breaks your softer slumbers; gentle Queen, I am not guilty of these harsh-voic'd words. Your wilder sence hurle at me; you mistake, I am your Eunuch, one that weeps for you. Qu. Oh Castrato, wast not those tears in vain, Come hither and i'l catch those falling drops Which prodigally over-flow their banks; There's Nectar in thine eye, oh let me drink it; These aged Cesterns are grown drie, and yeeld Not one relenting drop to ease my thirst. Castrato pitty me, my veins are parcht, And this same flesh which walls about my soul, Chops with excessive heat; a little water Castrato, but a little, though it hath been The birth of Toads, or what the leapers bath'd in; O shew thy love but in a little water, What can a Queen ask lesse, or subject grant her? Eu. Though I be tortur'd, for it yet i'l do it. (Ex. Eunuch. Qu. It hath quencht half my thirst to find some pitty. Land. I cannot bite mine arm, their tyrannie Denyes me what's mine own to feed upon, One mouthfull would suffice; I cannot get it, Poor unfed sides that passe along the street, I now am sensible of what ye want; Did I e'r think to die for want of food, Whose Table was the world, from whence I cull'd The rarities of nature to delight me, And more to feed my lust than Appetite? One bit of bread, though it were gray with age, Hoary and crusted with a second bark, Whose loathed outside would not court a Dog Arm'd with the edge of appetite, would seem A rare rich banquet to my emptie gorge; Oh I am worn to nothing with this want, Such emptiness ha's hunger made of me That you may draw me on another man. Some bread, some bread. Enter Eunuch with Wine and Meat, he congees with great reverence and ceremony to the Queen. Qu. Oh thou art welcome, Quick, dear Eunuch quick; what needs this delay? Away with form and ceremonious duty, Respect in this is too respectless. Eu. O give me leave, I will begin a health; It's very good, exceeding pleasant Wine. Qu. Dost thou deride my sufferance? Eu. No, no, not I. Qu. Give me the drink then, i'm all flame and fire. Eu. Say you so, say you so? then you must pardon me, I love your safety, and it's dangerous To drink while you are hot, pray cool and tarry: In the mean while I will begin to you; How tart and pleasing this is to the Palate, A sweeter Pheasant Christendom affords not. Land. I thank thee Eunuch, prethee give it me. Eu. You'l let me tast it for you, will you not? Are you so sharply set? fie, this sauce is naught. Land. Prethee make hast, hunger digest's no tasters. Eu. Come sir, I must feed you, oh, oh, not so fast, Be not so hasty; here, still you are too hasty; (he puts it to his mouth, &amp; puls it away again. Gentle sir it will digest the better. Land. More, more, oh it is excellent. Eu. Madam, here's for you now. Qu May heaven reward thee for't, oh it's rare. Eu. How do you like your banquet great Landrey? Land. Beyond compare. Eu. And you your drink? Qu. The Gods tast not the like. Eu. Ha, ha, ha, y'have both eat and drunk abominable poyson. Qu. Ha! Land. How! Eu. 'Tis true, I tell your Oracle; There's not an hours life between ye both; The poyson's sure, I did prepare it for ye, And have my self taken an Antidote: What say' now to th'other bout with Landrey, I can procure a second meeting for you, Indeed I can; think you not whoredome sweet Now you are a dying? is not you soul at ease, The murther of your Husband but a toy, A flea-biting? alack you feel it not. Qu. Inhumane slave, treacherous Rascal. Eu. Good words, Lady whore, good words: what are you loose? Landrey gets loose. Miraculous famine, ha's your empty guts Perswaded you to valour? will it scratch or bite? I'm sure't has no weapon, Monsiure disarm it. (shews a keen knife which he pulls out of his sleeve, staggers with faintness. Lan. He did so Rascal, yet your curious search Ne'r pri'd into this sheath; do you see this: With mine own hands it had let forth mine own life, Had the proud Monsiure trusted us to any, Thy self excepted, whom I now perceive The onely Author of our misery. (The Eunuch tript up his heels in scuffle and sits on him. You'r very nimble Hell-hound. Eu. O Lord sir, you know the cause, I'm lighter by a stone or two than you, Yet I am weight enough to keep you down; Stir and thou dy'stânow sir, what say you to me? How did you like your old Queen? was she gamesome? Did she apply her self like an apt whore Unto your loose imbraces? Land. Dog, let me rest. Eu. Good my Lord pardon me, Under your Graces favour be it spoken, You are our cushion, and i'l sit on you. I am not very heavie, am I sir? (joults upon him. I do not altogether weigh a man. Qu. Villanous Traytor, O let him rise, and wreck thy spite on me. Eu. You cog now, you'd rather I should kill. Qu. O spare him, spare him; Eunuch save my servant, And i'l forgive thee all thy sinnes against me; There's not an injurie thou dost to him, But wounds me to the soul. Eu. Pray then look here, How easily this Skean is sheath'd in him; An Engine of his own preparing Ladie, And pittie't were so brave a Gentleman, Such a neat hopeful whore-master as he, Should die by any weapon but his own. So perish all that love Adulterie. There, sit you there again: once more to you, (he sets him in his Chair. Who if your poyson do not work too fast, Shall see more sights like these before you die; But lest you should prevent us with your tongue, I will be bold to gag your Ladyship; I'l leave a peeping hole through which you shall See sights, shall kill thee faster than thy poyson; (draws the Curtain again. I am prepar'd now for Aphelia's death. All things are ready, and behold the King. Now for my part. (Ent. Clotair melancholly. Clot. I am too pittiful, a watrie flux, Which soft and tender hearted men call tears, Stand on mine eies, and do's express a nature Too like my Bearer; it is now with me Full tide in sorrow, my Cynthia governs strongly. Eu. How fares the great Clotair? Clot. What do the wise, Castrato, call the moisture which presumes To meditate betwixt my wrath and me? Eu. Expressions of a weak and silly nature, Passion of fools and women: are you a man And bear so tame a soul, such a smock spirit? The Distaff owns more spleen, more noble anger; Pray let her live untill the Pages write, An hopping balladry verse rime upon you, Great Clotair had a wife and she was fair, Yea fairer than the flowerie meads in May; (scoffingly. Oh she was fair, yet foul; most ridling sence, Oh it is horrid; then to conclude In what a high streign you did take revenge, How like your house and honour, hark, how she dies, Strangled in tears fall'n from the Cuckolds eies; You are her husband sir, and now must own Her doubtfull issue, and her lawlesse lust; Although a Bull should leap her, you must father, And have a drove of forked Animals, Shall have their horns born with them to the sound, 'Twill save their prodigall wives the reacky labour.

Use not such violence good Gentlemen, I'l walk a lamb to slaughter, not repine At any torments you shall put me too, Onely be modest: commend me to my Lord, I doubt I never shall behold him more; For by the calculation of your looks I have not long to live. Clot. True Aphelia, confess &amp; turn thy fate; give me to know With what foul Monster thou hast wrong'd thy soul, Seam-rent that holy weed, Virginitie; And ease me of a load that bears more weight Than what my youthful sins have heap'd upon me.

Aphe. I've heard you swear, that you were poor in words, And knew not to express the happiness Which you conceiv'd was habitable here. How much my Lord is altred from himself! Clot. 'Tis thou art altred; true Aphelia, That whilst thy purer thoughts did awe thy will, I lov'd like an Idolater: I was possest That these two twins, these Globes of flesh, contain'd All that was happy both in earth and heaven; In this I could descrie the Milkey way, The maiden Zone that girds the waste of heaven; In this the seat of Paradice, and how The wanton Rivelets plai'd about the Isle Which puzzel yet Geopraphie: all this I could, I could in thee my sometime chast Aphelia Find and rejoyce in; but thou art now An undrest wilderness wherein I walk, Losing my self 'mongst multitude of beasts; O savage actions! Come dispatch. Aphe. Sirâ? Clot. I'l hear no more. Aphe Heaven will then; And though it bear an ear far distant hence, Both hear and pitty me. O my lov'd Lord, Shoul'd but a dream work on my fancy, That you were thus to suffer as I am, It would conspire to kill me with more speed Than these your threatning Ministers; alas, I'l force a gentler nature in the steel, And with my rainy eies weep out their heat; Which as it dies should hiss it self to scorn, For offering to contain but fire to hurt you; And will you then a bold spectator stand, Smiling at what I suffer? shed but one tear, Or counterfeit a sorrow for my sake, A little seeming woe, and I shall die Sick of your kindnesse, not your crueltie. Clot. O my soft temper, her sweet harmonie Will melt me into fool; to hear these words, The Mother is to busie in mine eies; What shall I do? Eu. Make a new Hell, And if thou canst, create more Devils, do, And they will find imployment all on her; For since the generall Creation, Time never did produce a fowler sinner, Or one more begger'd hell in punishing. Clot. Thou hast awak'd me; Whore will you confesse? Do not inforce your death through wilfulness; (drags her by the hair. Speak stubborn silence, or i'l break thy heart. Aphe. My Lord and Husband, oh my Lord and husband, Regard my miserie and pittie me. Clot. Thou'rt cruel to thy self, I wrong thee not; It is not I that tear this precious Fleece, (again. This glorious excrement, in validitie, Another Cholcos better seeming Jason. I pull not off these curious sporting Tresses, (again. Fit braids to Captive Kings hadst thou been honest. I wound thee not, confesse, and live as free As mountain air, I will not injure thee. Aphe. My gracious Prince, I dare not call you husband, Your actions do forbid, which write me slave And not your equall; if to be your wife Has pluckt this misery upon my head, Or caus'd in you this phrensie, put me off, I will indure it patiently; but if e'râ Clot.

With living Clay, three times ten thousand men, Approved Warriers, souls of blood and fire, That onely know to do, and not to suffer, Make head against you; believe me sir, A braver Troop, and spirits more resolv'd, Life never put in action: young Brissac Now old enough to quit his Fathers death, Together with the ruine of his Sister, H'as vow'd destruction to your name and ashes. Clot. Let them come on, wee'l dare them do their worst; This Castle will indure a fortnights siege, Before the expiration of which time, My Brother with his fellow Peers of France, Shall whip these Rebels for their insolence.

Then stand upon your guard; yet that's as bad, The Castle's wall'd about with walking steel, And you but tempt your death in your escape, If you stay here, provoke it. The Monsiur, like the God of war, bestrides A bounding Courser, who is therefore proud To be so back'd, as knowing whom he bears: So Centaur-like he's anckor'd to his seat, As he had twind with the proud steed he rides on; He grows unto his saddle all one piece, And that unto his Horse; who thus unmov'd, Sits like a Perseus on his Pegasus, Stable and fleet. Who at head of all his Troops, With words inflames 'em that did burn before, But now appear much brighter; their glistering arms Reflecting 'gainst the Sun, doth lightning mock; Unto which blaze, their Drums and Horses hoofs Do not want much of Thunder: such is the show, As if great Mars, angry with humane race, Did lead the Gods to battel 'gainst the Earth. Eu. How does your Grace? how fares your Majestie? Clot. The Monsiur? did he not name the Monsiur? 2 Sould. I did my Lord. Clot. Is he joyned with them too? Then Dooms-day is at hand, I see my ruine. Go to the Castle walls to summon them To render an accompt of their intents. Ask the proud Monsiur (though I know the cause) Looks on Aphelia. Why his presumptious and ambitious feet, Have on the bosome of his mother earth, Made a broad road of treason: go, begone. (Exe. Souldiers. Castrato thou dost love me, i'm sure thou dost; I have such proofs of thy true hearted-love, That I must put my life into thy hands. Thou see'st how all things stand, my wife she's false, Her brother seeks my life, the Monsiur's thoughts (Back'd with the ever factious souls of France) Aim at the Gallick Crown and dignitie, Whil'st I a catiff and neglected Prince Must fall by traytors hands. Eu. What mean you sir? Clot. Look, here's a Pistoll in whose womb lies death, A heavie leaden sleep. Eu. Would you I should Trie the conclusion here? make her confesse By other instruments her horrid guilt, In this there's too much mercy. Clot. Hear me speak, I'l trouble her no further; let her sin Be punish'd from above, i'l wait heavens leisure, Here Eunuch take thou this, it was prepar'd For the adulterate Landrey; here, receive it, And if thou lov'st me use it upon me: Come shoot me through, I know I shall be slain, (If not by thee, yet by the enemie) And therefore to prevent the bitter scorn Of the insulting foe (which is a death So full of horror to the conquer'd, No Tyranny is like it) use this handfull, The handsom'st weed that nature can produce In the large Storehouse of her providence, Can shew no simple like it; for this cures At once, the sicknesse of the mind and body. Thou shalt, I know thou wilt, I prethee take it; It is not murder, tender-hearted fool Which thou commits, rather a sacrifice, For which heaven will reward thee. Eu. I do not know the nature of your Gods, Yet on your words i'l trie their kindnesse. Clot. Nobly resolv'd, come shoot me quickly then. Eu. I never was liker t'express my selfe Than at this minute; do not betray me tears, (aside. The Eunuchs nature must be harsh and cruell. Aphe. O spare him Eunuch, spare him, save my Lord, And i'l forgive thee all thy sins 'gainst me. Eu. Peace foollsh woman, 'tis thou that kill'st thy Lord, Were't not for thee he might live long and happy; Pray let me kisse your hand, and take my leave Of my best best Master. Clot. Do't and be sudden then: ah what means this? (as he kisses his hand, he snatches out his sword. Eu. Marry sir this it means, That if this fail, this shall perform the deed; Think not but I will kill you, do not fear, I am the excellent'st he alive at these same toyes, Look here my coufin'd fool I do not bungle. (shews Landrey and the Queen. Clot. Are these dead then? Eu. As sure as you live, pray ask them else; Unlesse this Ewes flesh too intense in heat Be lingring yet behind; she's scarcely dead, But in her dying ears i'l howl this noise; Look Queen, here's the top-branch of all thy Family, Mark but how kindly for thy sake i'l use him. Clot. Then I perceive I have been much abus'd, So ha's my chaster Queen; oh my curst fate! Eu. Oh, do you so, do you so. Qu. Oh, oh, oh. (Queen dyes. Eu. There broke a Strumpets heart; hear me King, Thy Mother was a foul adulteress, A cruel butcherer of innocents; Witnesse thy brother, that thy Mother's false, Witnesse thine own eyes that beheld the fall And ruine of the Dumain Family. Thy Mother's deep in blood, for which she's damn'd: You ravisht fair Chrotilda; Clodimir Your valiant Uncle, brother to this Queen, Was for the foul fact slain; for which mistake, Dumain, Lamot, Maria, Isabel, And the abus'd Chrotilda, if by flight She had not sav'd her life, had fall'n with them. I knowing this, and ever pittying The wrongs that they indur'd, Have found it time thus to revenge them. Clot. What were their wrongs to thee? Eu. I'l not Capitulate mine injuries, (beat a March softly within. I hear my time is short. Clot. How fain would I preserve my life from death, Since my Aphelia's chast; to think her false, (Not that I fear the foe) made me dispair Of future comfort. Eunueh, spare my life, I will forgive thee, and reward thee too; Remember who it is that sues to thee. Eu. In that remembrance I have lost my self, I cannot strike him, my relenting heart Yerns on his Princely person: take your sword, But on condition Clotair, thou shalt swear By thy descent, thy princely parentage, By the wrong'd souls of all those innocents To thy lust satisfi'd, by Aphelia's self, Or any thing thy soul shall hold more dear, Upon receipt, to guide the fatal point Directly to thy heart. Clot. Why would'st thou so? Eu. Pish, I'l teach thee to be speedy in the fact; Remember how thy Royall Father fell; Behold thy Mother murther'd by this hand; Into thy bosome cast thine inward eyes. And view the sorrows I have heaped on thee: Look on Aphelia, and let her wrongs Prompt thy slow hand to this most timely flaughter; I cannot brook delay, or do, or suffer. Clot. A Heathen, and a Traytor die with thee. Eu. A Christian Heathen Clotair if thou wilt, Made so by thee; read that and break thy heart. (Enter the Monsieur and his Comp. Mo. Force ope the door, seiz on his Royal person: now Clotair Thou are the Monsieur's pris'ner; Tyrant say, Where is Aphelia your Adulteress! (stands amaz'd Clot. It makes no matter where. Bris. O my dear Sister, O my dearest life. Dum. See Noble Lords, Here lies that Hel-hound Eunuch; villain up, And tell us who ha's done these fatall deeds. Eu. They'r ne'r ali'd to thee that did these Acts, Chrotilda and a woman. Dum. Villain thou li'st, my sister's gone a weary pilgrimage, And for this many years with grief I speak it, Been travel'd none knows where. Clot. What am I? What strange and uncouth thing? Eu. A ravisher, And better to instruct thee in thy self; Had not Chrotilda been, incestuous. Omnes. Hold, hold your Royal hand; what will you do? Clot. What else but follow her; shall Clotair live A Captive to his Brother, slav'd to sin, Inthral'd in wedlock that's incestuous, O ravisher and murtherer of his friend, There's no way left to rid me but my sword, Of all these ills at once. Oh wrong'd Chrotilda. Dum. My sister? Clot. I Dumain, no Eunuch she; No sun-burnt vagabond of Ãthiope, Though entertain'd for such by Fredigond. I say here lies thy ravisht sister slain By me the ravisher. Dum. Hold, hold, my heart. Eu. Lend me thy hand Clotair, have I thy hand? Clot. Thou most abus'd of women kind, thou hast. Eu. I should have kill'd thee King, and had put on A masculine spirit to perform the deed; Alas how frail our resolutions are! A womans weakness conquer'd my revenge: I'd spirit enough to quit my Fathers wrongs; And they which should have seen me act that part, Would not believe I should so soon prove haggard: But there is something dwels upon thy brow Which did perswade me to humanitie; Thou injur'dst me, and yet I spar'd thy life; Thou injurd'st me, yet I would fall by thee; And like to my soft sex, I fall and perish. Clot. Speak, for ever speak: Chrotilda, Chrotilda. Dum. My Sister's in mine eies, this brave revenge Should have been mine, and not thy act Chrotilda; Away salt rhume, Chrotilda laughs at thee, Her spirit is more manly. Aphe. I must weep too, Mine injuries and hers are so near kin, That they must bear each other company In tears of blood and death; For my griev'd heart too long with earth, Would gladly seek a way to find out rest. Clot. Art thou joyn'd with her too against thy self? Will my Aphelia leave me? pardon sweet, My love is fatall, and too well thou know'st The deadly proof in fair Chrotilda death; Yet leave me not though I refrain thy bed, And must abandon all those thoughts of love Which married couples use; yet we may sit And gaze upon each other, tell sad tales Of ruin'd Princes, wrong'd Virginitie; And when our utterance is tyr'd by speech, Wee'l sit and sigh a sad parenthesis, And then proceed again, then sigh again A silent Chorus to our History; Our tears shall keep our sorrows ever green, Still springing, never ripe: shall we do thus To lengthen out our grief? Aphe. For ever King, The hand of heaven lies on me; for I feel My inward and externall injuries Wrestle with life, in which condition My soul is woried by that Tyrant death. I must forsake thee Clotair Clot. Stay awhile, it is unkindly done to leave me thus: O she is gone, for ever, ever gone; And I stand prating here between them both, The fatall cause of death unto them both. Wilt thou not break proud heart, I prethee break, Prove not a Rebell to thy Prince like these; It's well there is some loyaltie in thee yet; Thou art commanded by meâ (the King faints. Bris. Gracious my Liege. Clot. Charles I have injur'd thee, and thee Dumain; Can ye forgive me? Bris. Good your Grace Call back your spirits, think what's to be done. Clot. I consider well, and the now King, The quondam Mounsieur shall not denie me this; Half of the honours of the dead Landrey We do confer on thee, the other half Be thine Dumain; Charles shall be Duke of France, Thou of the Palace Major: this is our will. Dum. Great King, you are not yet so neer your end, Forfend it heaven. Bris. Look up my Gracious Lord. Monsi. My Royall Brother? Clot. I begin to faint, A darknesse like to death hangs on mine eies; Lend me thine hand Brissac, and thine Dumain. Good gentle souls when ye shal mention me, And elder time shall rip these stories up, Dissected and Anatomiz'd by you; Touch sparingly this story, do not read Too harsh a comment on this loathed deed, Lest you inforce posterity to blast My name and Memory with endlesse curses; Call me an honourable murtherer, And finish there as I do. (He dyes. Dum. O Noble Lord, Whose fame was very essence to his soul; That gone, the other fled, choosing to die, Rather then live a King in infamy. Monsi. A heavie spectacle of grief and woe Have we beheld since our arivall here; Take up the body of the King, and these That for his love on either hand lie slain, They shall lie buried in one Monument: And take up these; this was a Royall Queen When virtue steer'd her thoughts; but we may see, When we turn foes to good, to vice a friend, We fall like these, and like these thus we end. A dead March within. FINIS.</field>
