      <field name="fulltext">THOMYRIS, QUEEN of SCYTHIA. AN OPERA,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. Tho' all the Airs of this Opera are by the famous Scarlatti and Buononcini, except a few by other great Masters, neither the Words, the Thoughts, nor the Design owe any thing to Italy, except the Advantage of the Musick; to which, with more Pleasure yet than Pain, I have endeavour'd to make 'em subservient: I hope those who would not have Sense sacrific'd to Sound, nor the Mind displeas'd while the Ears are entertain'd, will consider the Difficulties in working so many Airs of different Kinds into one Subject, and in putting Words wholly different from the Italian, to Songs so full of pathetick Notes and nice Graces, in a Language perhaps too manly for such Composures, if not manag'd with the utmost Art. As here the Choice of the Songs was not my Province, I may the better do Justice to the Gentleman who provided that Part of the Entertainment. Tho' Musick is only his Diversion, the best Masters allow him to be so good a Judge, that I have no Reason to doubt but his Collection will be generally approv'd; tho' 'tis impossible that, in such a Variety, every Thing should please every particular Fancy. As for the Recitative, Mr. Pepusch is known to be so great a Composer, that there is no doubt but he has also done his Part in that, and in adding such Ritornels, and other Musick, as were necessary to make the whole a Compleat Opera.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Long had a restless Monarch's boundless Sway Made half the Globe or tremble, or obey; Doom'd, like his Subjects, all Mankind his Slaves; By Choice destroying, as bless'd ANNA saves; And, turning all his Neighbours into Foes, Grudg'd Men Heav'n's darling Gifts of Freedom and Repose. T'oppose his Force was more than Man could dare; Heav'n had reserv'd that Glory for the Fair. With Virtues crown'd, adorn'd with ev'ry Grace, A Queen then rul'd a Warlike Northern Race; Who, bless'd and free, contented with their own, For Glory fought, and the World's Good alone. Down, by her Arms, Grand Cyrus soon was hurl'd, And, by a Woman, Heav'n reveng'd the World. So since to ANNA, in a happy Hour, Jove gave his Scales of Justice, and of Pow'r, Inspir'd by Her, what Wonders still afford Well-manag'd Treasures, and her Warrior's Sword! From willing Mines, with more than Human Care, Spirits are dealt thro' ev'ry Nerve of War. Her Genius quells the World's ambitious Foe: 'Tis Valour strikes, and Prudence guides the Blow. Yet, when this Day we show a Scythian Queen, Think not we dare attempt a Modern Scene. As Britain's Beauties all the World's excel, Great ANNA's Reign disdains a Parallel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Persons Represented. Thomyris, Queen of Scythia, Signiora Margarita, who sings a Treble. Orontes, her Son and General, Mr. Hughs, or Signior Valentino, A Contra-tenor. Cleora, a Persian Princess, Niece to Cyrus, and design'd by him to marry Tigranes, Mrs. Tofts, A Treble. Tigranes, King of Armenia, Cyrus's Allie, Mr. Lawrence, A Tenor. Baldo, waits on Orontes, Mr. Leveridge, A Base. Media, waits on Cleora, Mrs. Lindsey, A Treble.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The SCENE is in that Part of Scythia, inhabited by the Massagetes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Time of Action about Three Days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE A Tent in a Camp, Trees on both Sides. Cleora is discover'd in a melancholic Posture, Media by her; Guards at a Distance. Cleo. From Scythian Bonds, to Persia's Court, Oh! how shall I return? Must I, alas! be Fortune's Sport, And only live to mourn? AIR. Freedom, thou greatest Blessing, Why have I lost thy Joys? Pining, no Rest possessing, Grief all my Hours employs. Thy Loss now to my Eyes A Flood of Tears will cost: Oh! why do we not prize Our Treasure 'till 'tis lost! Freedom, &amp;c. Med. Cease, Princess! Calm your Thoughts to Peace! Nor, grieving thus, your Woes increase. Pray Note, That throughout the Opera whatever is mark'd thus âwith double Comma's in the Margent is left out, to shorten the Performance. âWomen, fram'd for soft Alarms, âMay of Eastern Kings complain, âWho luxurious, ev'n in Arms, âClog Armies with a Female Train. âThe Lumber of the War we prove; âAnd grace no Camp, but that of Love. Yet, tho' surpriz'd by Scythian Foes, The Niece of Cyrus feels unusual Woes, That Monarch, fortunate and great, Will soon reverse our Fate; And stubborn Scythia shall obey His Arbitrary Sway. AIR. Ever merry, Gay and airy, Be adjourning Care and Mourning! Sorrow never comes too late; We're impairing By Despairing. We're improving, Care removing. Then be happy, spite of Fate! Ever merry, &amp;c. Cleo. Thy gay Humour, to my Grief Brings no Cure, tho' some Relief. Yet, in Innocence secure, Bravely I'll the worst endure; Like thee, strive my Heart to chear; And lull asleep my Care. AIR. What should alarm me? No Foe can harm me. Let Virtue arm me; Fears will be vain. Yet, Freedom wanting, My Breast they're haunting; My Heart is panting, I live in Pain. What should, &amp;c. SCENE II. The Scene changes, and discovers Thomyris seated in State, Courtiers, Guards, and other Attendants. Thom. rising. With Heav'n's and your Assent, Queen of the Northern World I reign; Bless'd in your Ease, with Mind intent Your Freedom to maintain. My Soul no greater Empire craves: 'Tis nobler thus my Pow'r to hold, And lead by Love the Free and Bold, Than drive a World of Slaves. AIR. Rouse, ye Brave, for Fame and Glory, And oppose invading Spight! Drive the slavish Foe before ye! Turn to Terror all their Raging! You must conquer when engaging, 'Tis for Liberty you fight. Rouse, ye, &amp;c. Enter Orontes, and kneels to Thomyris. Oron. Hail! mighty Empress! O mia Regina! Note, The Part of Orontes being Sung by Signior Valentino, at the Desire of most of the Nobility who subscrib'd for the first Performances of this Opera, you have here the same in Italian, as it is translated out of English, and adjusted to the same Musick. Tho. Rise, my Son. Oron. Return'd with Spoils your Arms have won, Permit me at your Feet to bless Kind Heav'n, and you, for our Success. And may this first Advantage prove A happy Omen from above! [He rises. Vincitor qual io ritorno, Deh! Lasciate Ã  vostri piedi Ch'io ringrazi, in si bel giorno, Voi, el'Ciel di tal vittoria, Primo grado a nuova gloria! Tho. So soon victorious! Oron. The numerous Foe, to pass the Flood, At distant Fords divided stood. A Part, spread o'er the Scythian Field, Was charg'd, and forc'd to yield: And here the Conquer'd wait, From you to know their Fate. Tento spesso l'Inimico Di passar l'opposto fiume; Ma il Valor dell' armi vostre L'assali, l'oppresse, Ã© vinse: E il rubel conobbe in vano, Ch'il suo fato Ã¨ in vostra mano. Tho. I'll see 'em now, and bless The Pow'rs who grant Success! The Trumpets, Kettle-Drums, Hoboys, &amp;c. begin a Warlike Movement. Enter several Scythian Soldiers, with Ensigns, Standards and other Trophies, and leading several Persian Prisoners, and Cleora last, attended by Media. Tho. Soldiers, stay, and, e're you go, Leave with me that Female Foe! [The Soldiers having left Cleora, march and Exeunt. Cleora unveils. Cleo. Feast, Thomyris, feast your Eyes With a weak, tho' Royal Prize! Oron. Guard me Heav'n! what Charms I view, Charms, that Conqu'rors may subdue! [Aside. Quai bellezze, o Dei, veggio, Ond'e vinto il vincitore! Cleo. Shou'd the Foe no Favour find, To the Virgin yet be kind! You'll perhaps but lend to Day What Cleora may repay. AIR. Gently, gently, treat my Sorrow, The Compassion that I borrow. I to Morrow may return. Soon to Mourning Joy is turning. I was happy in the Morning, In the Ev'ning here I mourn. Gently, &amp;c. Tho. Mov'd with Pity, not with Fear, Princess, we the Yielding spare. Let an ambitious restless Foe, Be proud of universal Woe. Whoe'er true Greatness understood Knows, to be great is to be good,â Honour'd, safe, and serv'd like me, In Scythia then remain. The Court your only Prison be, Your Word your only Chain. AIR. No more let Sorrow pain you! Our Love alone shall chain you; And ev'ry Joy restore. New Pleasures shall detain you: Liberty can give no more. No more, &amp;c. [Exit Thom. and Attendants. Oron. By my Royal Mother chear'd, What, bright Princess, can be fear'd? Firm in Protection, and in Love, To save and bless is all her Aim. Gracious, like the Pow'rs above, And, like 'em, Still the Same. Principessa piu vezzosa Delle Stelle, che temete? S'affidata ne'l amore Di mia Madre gia voi siete, Como Spirito immortale, Sempre dessa, Ã© Sempre equale. AIR. âTell me, why still lament you? âWhat Sorrow can torment you? âYour Eyes command their Fate. âCharmer, 'tis you alarm us: âYour very Tears disarm us: âYou shine in ev'ry State. âCleo. Thankful for your kind Relief, âYet untun'd for Joy by Grief, âLet me, gen'rous Prince, compose âA Breast still mov'd, tho' eas'd of stormy Woes! âOron. I must leave youâYet I'll view,â âOh! I must tear my self from you. âWe lose with Ease, by Beauty's Charms, âWhat with Toil we got by Arms; âThe Fair, subdu'd, a sweeter Conquest gains, âAnd the Proud Victor wears the Captive's Chains. AIR. Bright Wonder of Nature, Divine in each Feature, You conquer all Hearts: Admiring, we're dying: 'Tis only by flying We're safe from your Darts. Bright, &amp;c. [Exit Orontes. Delitie degl' occhi, Contento del l'alma, Deh! Lascia il rigor. Non vedi ch'io moro Suave ristoro D'amante mio Cor? Delitie, &amp;c. Da Capo. Cleo. He's goneâ'tis wellânot all my Pride Cou'd my Disorder hide. Ye Pow'rs, Oh! whether shall I move? From War's Alarms, I turn to those of Love. AIR. Med. Never let your Heart despair, While the Gods with Charms have crown'd you. Tho' designing Foes surround you, Spight and Envy cannot wound you. Innocence shall guard the Fair. Never let, &amp;c. Cleo. I chide my panting Heart in vain I feel a soft, a strange Emotion reign; And dread, yet love the Pleasure, and the Pain. AIR. I know not what alarms me, And warms me, Gently growing, Now all my Breast is glowing: My Heart is firing. I know not what to name The secret pleasing Flame; But sure, if Love's the same, Sweet is expiring. I know, &amp;c. [Exit Cleora. AIR, that may be sung instead of the foregoing. Love would invade me: My Eyes have betray'd me. Pride would arm me: But my Heart says, 'tis vain. When the Foe but invades me, to charm me, Danger ne'er can alarm me with Pain. âMed. Armenia's Prince, Tigranes, now in vain âMay strive Cleora's Heart to gain. âWhat on him Cyrus would bestow, âIs doubly conquer'd by his Foe. Enter Baldo. Bald. Fair Damsel, if it is a Fault T'intrude upon a Virgin's Thought, Let, from the Prince, this precious Stone, From me, this precious Heart atone. Med. Fair-speaking Sir, 'tis well addrest. I, for the Ring, excuse the rest. Bald. To gain by yours, your Lady's Favour, Is a young Lover's first Endeavour. And, when the Pair of Turtles coo, Baldo the trusty Squire, and you, In Course know what we have to do. Med. I'll serve the Prince; and, as for you, I guess you have not much to do. AIR. Bald. My Delight, my Dear, my Princess! With Desire I lose my Senses. I before you feel with Fury My Blood hurry Thro' ev'ry Vein: Like a Dart I feel a Smart, And something tickle at my Heart. Dying thus who can complain? I had vow'd to play the Rover, Fool with Love, or give it over: But who can, tho' grave and wise, 'Scape those Dimples, Lips and Eyes! Then, to bless you, I'll address you, Press you, kiss you, and caress you; 'Till like me, you cry, 'Tis vain, Oh! my Dear, to frown and feign: Dying thus, who can complain! Med. Hold! how dare you be so urging? Would you ravish here a Virgin? Think you for your Ring I'll bear it? There it isâBut I'll never wear it. [She makes an Offer to give him back the Ring, and at his Approach puts it up again. AIR. Away, you Rover! For shame give over! You play the Lover, So like an Ass. You press, and thunder, To bring us under; Then all you plunder, And leave the Place. Tho' you're for storming, And think you're charming, Your faint performing We read in your Face. Away, &amp;c. Bald. I'll be constant, never fear! Tho' that's strangely out of Fashion. If you doubt me, come, my Dear, Take an Earnest of my Passion! AIR. Med. Prithee leave me! presume not to court me! Bald.

Your Virtues admiring, How sweet is delaying, Our Moments repaying? Tho. In vain do you press me! Oh why do you press me? Cleo. Oh why do you press me? Detain me to bless me. How sweet, &amp;c. [Exeunt Thom. and Cleo. Enter Media, follow'd by Baldo in a warlike Habit. AIR. Bald. Halt! when Love and Honour calls you. Tho' some other might maul you, No harm now can befal you, Your Anger takes me down. Take my Heart, my Love to crown. Let me garrison the Town; Then, then, let me hang or drown. Med. Follow your Prince! Go join his Army! Dare to be kill'd, and then, then, then, you'll charm me. Bald. I stay'd behind, from him to bear A Message to his Princely Fair. Med. You have your Answer: What more d'ye want, Sir? Bald. Some kind Token of your Favour; And then your Soldier's made for ever. AIR. Med. Can you leave ranging?âNo Ne'er think of changing?âNo. And constant grow.âNo. Reform and marryâNo. In Love ne'er vary.âNo. You'd soon grow weary, And from me go. You'd wish to leave me. I'd wish to leave you. You would deceive me. I would deceive you. Your Fate you know. Can you leave ranging, and constant grow? &amp;c. Bald. in Imitation of Media, I'd ne'er grow weary.âNo. Nor from you go.âNo. Med. Will nothing fright you out of Love? Then know, I'll ne'er your Flame approve. What e'er of Constant Love is said; Of the dull Whim we're all afraid. Our Flame we must smother, When tir'd of each other. AIR. Wou'd you charm us? Wou'd you warm us? Learn to rove, and hide your Passion. Ev'ry Fair by Turns be courting, Never serious, ever sporting; Whining Love is out of Fashion. Wou'd you, &amp;c. [Exit. Bald. Who knows where to have her! In vain I endeavour. Oh! I cou'd rail; I cou'd rave; I cou'd curse; I cou'd wed her for SpightâI cou'dânever do worse. No; wisely I'll go, And turn my Fury on the Foe. Tho' wild, like Fortune, now I find her, My brave Exploits may make her kinder. AIR. Farewel Love, and every Pleasure! Honour calls, and we must part. War from you now claims my Leisure. I'll go raise my Fame, and Treasure: Storm, and Plunder; Fight, and Thunder: Then at last I'll bring you under. Gold and Conquest gain the Heart. Farewel Love, and ev'ry Pleasure! Honour calls, and we must part. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Royal Tent. Orontes sleeping, and chain'd. Guards about him. After a short piece of Instrumental Musick, proper for a Sleep. Enter Tigranes. Tigr. âHe sleeps! still Happy, spight of Fate. âOf Quiet he partakes; âKind Dreams upon his Slumbers wait. âI envy him this easie State. âThe Jealous ever wakes.â Wake, Orontes! wake, arise! [Orontes awakes; and, looking about, starts up in a great Surprise. Oro. Ha! sure I dreamâWhat Objects strike my Eyes! To ArmsâMy SwordâHa! Chain'dâ Tigranes here!â My Fellow Soldiers!â Ah! ch'io sognoâche remiroâ Strano oggetto! all'armi, all'armi. La mia SpadaâAhi! son legatoâ Qui Tigrane!âMiei Soldati!â Tigr. Surpriz'd, like you, Death, or your Chains they share. Retreating Cyrus, press'd by you, His Camp did to the Foe resign, With Dainties stor'd, and treach'rous Wine, Your Scythians to subdue. Lethargic Drugs, mix'd with the gen'rous Juice, Soon did to Sleep your wearied Troops reduce: âWith Ease a Grave they found in every Bed; âBuried in Wine and Sleep, already like the Dead. Oro. Oh! Fraud alone of Vict'ry cou'd deprive 'em. Kill me! Why shou'd I survive 'em? Coll'arte sol tu vincergli potevi Se l'opra uvoi compir, me pure uccidi! Tigr. Brave Orontes, you must live. Oro. No; I hate the Life you give. No; se tu me la doni, odio la vita. Tigr. Live. Oro. No; let me die. No lascia, chio mora. Tigr. Live, from Revenge Cleora to retrieve. Oro. Oh! her Name forces a Reprieve. Ah! questo nome sol mi chiama in vita. Tigr. Promise to resign the Fair, And now I'll set you free. Oro. Death, or Slav'ry, let me bear; But claim her not of me! Ch'io la ceda? mai non fia. Morte, e catene soffriro ben pria. âFate enough to you is kind; âYou're free, approv'd, and I confin'd. âTigr. Who knows what Fate designs! âI dread too sudden Joys. âWhen the glitt'ring Lightning shines, âSoon the Thunderbolt destroys. AIR. Unhappy Lovers are ne'er contented: Lamenting, tormented, I pine, I burn. My fair disdains me; Honour restrains me; Jealousie pains me; In vain I mourn. Unhappy, &amp;c. âOro. The same my Passions, worse my Woes: âMy Fair, and Fate, my Joys oppose. âLet Valor then the double Cause decide; âHonour's first, then Love's be try'd. âBy Orosmades by the Sun I swear, âTo her own Choice, I'll leave the Fair. âFirst release me, as I freed you, âThen let me fall, if she's decreed you. Tigr. âBe wise, comply! âResolve, no more to love her, or to die. Oron. Without her, Life no Joys can give. No more to love her! 'tis no more to live. Senza lei, piacer non sento. Se non l'amo, piu non vivo. Oron. No more to love her! Ah, no! I'll ne'er give over. E're I comply, I'll die. I prize no Joy above her. Love chains my fond Heart. In vain from her you tear me: We ne'er can part. She's here, she's ever near me. No more, &amp;c. Ch'io piu non l'ami! Ah! no: morro ben pria. Vorrebbe i cor, No nol potra mai. Ella e crudel; Ma che piu bella assai: Ell' e infedel; Lo so; ma cio non fia. [Da Capo. Tigr. Honour has conquer'd: Gen'rous Foe, Take Liberty, the Debt I owe. [The Guards set Orontes free. Oro. I thank Tigranes: Tho' now Life's a Pain. Like Friends we'll part, like Foes to meet again. Benche il viver sia tormento, O Tigrane, io ti ringrazia. Amici or Siam, ci rividrem nemici. Tigr. I no Hopes can discover. Oron. I despair, yet I love her. Both. Like War's are Love's Alarms: Tho' Fatal are the Charms, Who can give over? In van sospiro, e bramo. Non posso piu sperar; E pur io amo. Exeunt severally. SCENE III. A Palace. Enter Media, Baldo. Med. The grieving Princess to revive, Is there no Hope, he's yet alive? Bald. Oh! Let the losing World complain. Scythias's Brave Prince, our other Hope is slain. Tho' great Numbers 'scap'd by Flight, He, with the rest, fell in the Night. While with our Queen the Nation mourns, Grief to revengeful Fury turns. Our Troops, of whom the Van alone Forc'd Persia's Camp, then were by Fraud o'erthrown, Now more wary grown, Retreat, but to give the Foe A nobler Overthrow. Med. The Princess comesâAwayâyou might enrage The grief I wou'd asswage. [Exit. Bald. Enter Cleora. AIR. Cleo. VVhy must Sorrow for ever attend me, Never end me! How long must I crave For Death, and the Grave! Hopes are lostâWhat I mourn Can ne'er return. Life's all Anguish: We but Languish, And our Loss deplore, When Love is no more. Med. Why shou'd you crave For Death and the Grave? Old Maids in Despair All Hopes may give over. But the Young, and the Fair, Chuse Life, and a Lover. AIR. VVhen One's gone, n'er keep a Pother. Get another! get another! Youth and Beauty should be gay. Cheer up, and again be shining, Never whining, Nor repining: Among Lovers that's the Way. Cleora goes out, and Media follows her, singing to her. [Exeunt. Enter Thomyris. Tho. Weep no more! or weep unseen, Hopeless Mother; mournful Queen! Tho' deepest in a Royal Brest, Woe must be born, yet not exprest. Oh! thou, my only Hope, my Son, While I retire to weep alone, Nobler mourning Scythia owing, Shall with her Tears see Persian Blood o'erflowing. AIR, Humble Shepherds, Grief may pain you: But no Forms in Woe restrain you. Your Complaint the Pain asswages. Fate with greater Anguish tries me; Yet the common Cure denies me. Grief oppos'd, more fiercely rages. Enter Media, who throws her self hastily at the Queen's Feet. Med. Help! Gracious Queen! Grant Innocence Relief. Tho. Who dares intrude on Royal Grief? Med. Oh! Pardon! In this dreadful Hour, Be Great in Mercy, as in Pow'r! Unless you save, Cleora dies, Devoted by the Crowd, an impious Sacrifice. Tho. Oh! She less wretched yet than I! But Justice bids me intervene: The weak from Lawless Rage to free, And still exert the Queen. Like the Thunder, Guilt alarming, Royal Frowns the World can awe. âHeav'n with Pow'r our Hands is arming âTo maintain, and give the Law. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Temple. Enter Cleora as a Victim, Priests, and People. Cleo. Hear ye Scythians, e'er I fall! Heav'n, hear a Royal Victim's Call. Ye Pow'rs, my welcome Death forgive! To meet my Love, my Soul is flying. Since for him I could not live, With Joy for him I'm dying. Enter Thomyris, Guards, Media, and other Attendants. Tho. Forbear!âHold your Impious Hand! Resign the Royal Maid! 'Tis I command.â Guards! To my Tent attend her.â When I Protect, who dares offend her? Cleo. Why must I thank you for the Life I hate? Great Queen, how wretched is my Fate! [Ex. Cleora, Media, and some Guards. Tho. Then what is mine! Was ever known So griev'd a Mother, or so dear a Son! He's lost; not vanquish'd, but betray'd. My Hope, my Joy, my Son, my Darling's dead! Scythians, here our Loss bewailing, See my Tears, Hear my Pray'rs! Join, join with me till they're prevailing. Tho. kneels.] YE Pow'rs! I for Vengeance call! Let the Grand Oppressor fall. Punish our invading Foes, Revenge our Wrongs, and give the World Repose. A Shout.] Hark! This joyful Scythian Shout Declares the Persian Rout. 'Tis done, Avenging Pow'rs! 'Tis done. And ev'ry Persian Mother mourns a Son. AIR. Sally, sally, before you they're falling. Revenge now is calling: Annoy 'em, Destroy 'em; Thro' Fire, And Water, Perdition, And Slaughter. Your Vengeance pursuing, With Terror renewing Despair, pale Horror, and Ruin. [Ex. Thom. and the People shout and Ex. SCENE V. The Field. Enter Tigranes in disorder, his Sword in his Hand, as from Fight. Tigr. All is lost: A hopeless Flight Succeeds the desperate Fight. Cyrus, glutted now with Blood, Swells with his own the Purple Flood. Barr'd a Retreat, in vain the Persians fly; In vain they Scythian Mercy try: I both disdain; and wou'd but bravely die. AIR. Vain Ambition, you ever fall: Tho' still you try To soar so high, You ever fall; All losing, while you aim at all. Pow'rs, who with great Souls inflame us, Why does Reason ne'er reclaim us Till our Fate is past recall? Vain Ambition, still you fall, &amp;c. Enter a Party of Scythian Soldiers, whom Tigranes engages till he is wounded; and Orontes enters. Oro. Hold! Scythians!âLet a nobler Fateâ Sciti, fermate il pie. Piu nobil Fatoâ Tigr. Victorious Prince, you come too lateâ Yet enough you Fatal prove, And doubly kill me, in Cleora's Love. Oro. Oh! Live! Tho' for her to contendâ Vivi per contrastarmi il suo possesso. Tigr. Too near my End, That Comfort Fate denies. Oro. Yet strive to liveâHelp! bear hence The wounded Prince, And save a Life a Prize. The Soldiers lead off Tigranes. Voi soccorrete il Principe ferito, E una vita, ch'io stimo a lai serbate. Ex. Tigranes and Soldiers. Enter Baldo. Bald. Hail! Prince, who the Day retriev'd, Who came, and sav'd, when lost believ'd! To your Valor Vict'ry's owing. See our Tears with Joy now flowing: Soon your Sight the Queen will cheer, And the Princessâ Oro. Oh! She's here. Oh! lei sen viene. Enter Cleora. AIR. Cleo. I revive now you're returning, All my Mourning Is lost in Joy. Oh! I ne'er can bear the Pleasure. Sorrow pain'd above all Measure; Joyful Transports now destroy. Re-enter Tigranes supported. âCleo. Oh! Like a fatal Dart, âSurprize, and Pity wound my Heart. âTigranes!âwho this Sight can bear! âTig. Oh! you o'er-pay me with a Tear. âYou give Pleasure in Despair. âI must leave you. âI'll not grieve you. âTo Superior Merit due, âWhile Life and you I lose, let others for you live. âWhen a pitying Tear you give, â'Tis more to die for you. Cleo. Unhappy Prince! Exit. Tigranes supported. Enter Thomyris. Oro. The Queen! [Kneels. La Regina. Tho. My Son! Oh! rise! thou Guardian of my Throne! Oro. No! Let me rooted here remain, Till I from you new Life obtain. Can I without Cleora live? Life without Love no Joy can give. No, lasciate, chio non posso Viver mai senza Cleora. Chi sa viver senza amare Non sa viver, ma penare. Tho. Rise! be happy; I comply. Oro. Oh! now you drown my Soul with Joy. O qual gioia il cor m'inonda! AIR. Tho. Pleasure calls: Fond Hearts recover! Fears are over. Let the Lover At last enjoy. May the Passion sweetly pain you, Kindly chain you, And never cloy. Oron. Soul of Pleasure, now to you I for Life again must sue. The Queen permits Possessing; But Heav'n, and you, must grant the Blessing. Or dimando a voi la vita, Mio Tesor! Doppo Tomiri Tocca al Cielo, e tocca a voi D'accordarla a i miei desiri. âCleo. Oh! ask no more what Fate's denying. âLet me rather share the Ruin âAll my Persian Friends pursuing, âThan blush at my complying. âOron. Oh! Reprieve me. âCleo. Leave me! Leave me! âMed. When of Friends War has bereft me, âWill you lose the last that's left you! âCleo. Hope's denied me. âOron. Then I must no longer sue. âAdieu! Adieu, to Life, and you. [Going. âCleo. Oh! Mortal Anguish! Oh! my Fears! âStay! 'tis more than Death to lose you. Give me Time to dry my Tears. I wou'd, but Love cannot refuse you. Oron. Oh, Joy! Oh, Blessing! Past expressing. Dolce gioia! indicibil piacere! AIR, Cleo. Lost in Pleasure, Love beguiling, Oh! you disarm me. Oron. Oh, my Treasure! Kindly Smiling, Oh! how you charm me. Oh! mia vita! Oh! mia speme! Oh! mio Tesoro! âTho. Bless the Pow'rs that grant the Blessing! âMed. Let the wond'ring World applaud! âOron. Share our Joys, all Hearts possessing; âAll. Lov'd at Home, and fear'd Abroad. CHORUS. Love and Vertue the Conquest obtain. Peace shall last; Freedom by Union shall gain: All Danger is past. Victorious, And Glorious, Astrea's Reign The Blessings shall maintain. FINIS.</field>
