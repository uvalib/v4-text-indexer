      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —The King's Palace. Guards and Trumpeters discovered—Enter Chamberlain and Courtiers, through arch. Chorus —“Anna Bolena.” Silence, ye trumps, the King's in the dumps, His project, alas, has miscarried; The Ambassador sent returns as he went, The lady declines to be married. To passion fond she won't respond— To all his love can show The Royal Fair with Golden Hair Politely answers “No.” Vis. Yes, noble friends, the news is sad as may be, Our mighty King is crying like a baby. His nerves have had the cruellest of shocks— Rejected by the Fair with Golden Locks. He comes; prepare to shew your loyal griefs, If not by tears, at least by handkerchiefs. Let every soldier draw out his bandanna, And bear't before him in a decent manner. Cap. Draw kerchiefs! (Soldiers do so) Present kerchiefs! (they hold them to their eyes) Steady there! Eyes wet! long faces! Smile, men, if you dare. Enter King and Minister and four Pages, one carrying pocket handkerchiefs in a gilt basket. Cap. Recover kerchiefs! (Soldiers return handkerchiefs to their pockets) King. Refuse my hand! it passes all belief. Give me another pocket handkerchief. (Page supplies him) Count. Sire, something still more wondrous did she do; She actually refused your presents, too. King. What, all my presents!—all my pretty things! The diamond necklace and the turquoise rings! The ermine tippet and the Cashmere shawl! Did you say all! Howell and James! Need I say of Regent Street. what all! She can't be woman! Count. Bear it like a man! King. I Would do so; but if I cannot how can I? I cannot but remember such things cost A precious lump of money—and that's lost. Count. This should to anger, sire, convert your grief. King. Give me another pocket handkerchief. (Page supplies him) For I must play the woman with mine eyes— Count. Sire, it will much your Majesty surprise To hear who plays the braggart with his tongue. King. Ha, who? Count. Your Minstrel. King. Graceful! Count. Yes; the young Gentleman hints, had he been sent to plead Your cause he should have won the fair. King. Indeed! By which he means to say that he's so clever, And so insinuating, she could never Have had the heart to say him nay—is't so? Count. 'Tis very like it, sire. King. The puppy! go, Bid him attend us instantly. (Exeunt Officer and Guards) I'll make The ballad-monger in his shoes to shake! Vis. (aside) Bravo! I owed the coxcomb an old spite. Count. (aside) Twenty to one against the favourite. King. The knave, too long in the King's favour basking, Now fancies he could have a queen for asking. The piping bull-finch! he expect to win her! I'm so enraged that—I could eat my dinner, If it were ready. Squibs and crackers! where Tarries this tuneful traitor? Enter Graceful, guarded. Ho! you're there! Duet—King and Graceful—“Fanny Gray.” King. Well, well, sir, so you've come at last, you might have come before; D'ye know, sir, I've the greatest mind to turn you out of door? I understand you've dared to say, had you come for to go To court the Fair with Golden Hair, she ne'er had answered “No!” Grace. Most royal sir, put off that frown, and don't begin to scold; The ambassador you sent to her was ugly, cross, and old. I only said I knew a way the Fair One's heart to catch, And make her glow like tinder at the thoughts of such a match! King. You think 'tis but to make your bow, with grace take off your hat, And she must straight enchanted be—but, sir, I smell a rat! You would yourself make love to her—you see I'm up to snuff— And marry her if she'd have you—I'm told you're rogue enough. Grace. Most royal sir, you've in your temper got a pain, I see; You jealous!—and of such a little humble lad as me. Make love to her! of course I would—as proxy for my King, And marry her—by proxy, too— King. By proxy—ha! that's quite another thing! King. This puts the matter in another light. Grace. I knew your Majesty would do me right. It may be nothing but a boyish dream, But I should make your merits, sir, the theme! Which I may say, without the least presumption, Require but to be known. King. The boy has gumption. (to Minister) You didn't set my merits forth, I fear. Count. Pardon me, sire. King. But not enough, that's clear. Count. Indeed I took the liberty to mention All I could think of. King. Have you no invention? Grace. Sire, it requires but memory in your case. King. (aside) Really the boy said that, now, with a grace. I've a great mind to let the youngster go And try his luck. (aloud) Well, my young friend, and so You positively think you should succeed? Grace. Upon my honour, sire, I do indeed. King. But you'd want fitting out, too, I presume, And I've been forking out, and to some tune. Grace. Not I; just as you see me I would speed hence; I only ask your letters, sire, of credence. King. Good Graceful, you shall have them in a crack. Grace. Then for a pound, I bring the lady back. Song—Graceful—“The Four-leav'd Shamrock.” I'll call a four-wheel'd cab, sir, And tip the man a crown, And at the fair one's palace gate Just bid him set me down; I'll not attempt to charm her sight With diamond, pearl, or gold, But praise your person, worth, and sense While I a note can hold. Yes, thus I'll play and chaunt my part, And so your trumpet sound; And though she have a marble heart I'll melt it, for a pound. I pledge my word of honour, To chase your fond alarms, Like Grisi in the “Peri,” She shall leap into your arms A leap made by Carlotta Grisi in the ballet of “The Peri,” which had been the great feature of the opera in 1843. And howsoe'er it may seem strange, And some may think me bold, The fair my cab brings back shall be The one with locks of gold. For I will play and chaunt my part, And so your trumpet sound; And though she have a marble heart, I'll melt it, for a pound. During this song the King sends off one of the Pages, who returns with writing materials—the King writes, using the Chamberlain's back for a table. King. Take your credentials, but with them take heed, I'll make a Count of you if you succeed; But if you fail, I swear, by my veracity, I'll make you then account for your audacity. Grand Scena, on the most approved principle of Modern Operatic Composition. Recitative—King and Graceful. King. Go, boy, and that in safety you may wend, A patent safety cab I recommend. Grace. To me your counsels ever are commands! I fly! (Exit) King. Away—Joy go with you and sixpence! Andante—“Son of Freedom.”—“Norma.” King. Lucidora! so long invited, Shall we never, never here behold thee dining? Thy adorer's desert still slighted, Must he ever o'er his lonely wine be whining? Chamberlain and Chorus (sotto voce). With Master Graceful awhile dissemble, But anon the rogue shall tremble. King. Still must grief be my heart devouring— Thou, to gall my pride assaying; My sweet temper refusal souring, As the thunder—as the thunder sours the beer. (Agitato) But no, Hope takes a sight at Fear, And laughs to scorn the Wizard— Graceful, I feel, will stick at naught, And nothing but a merry thought Shall now stick in my gizzard. [King] (Con Spirito)—“The Minstrel Boy.” My Minstrel Boy for a cab is gone, In the ranks no doubt he'll find one; A Patent Safety I like, I own, Where the driver sits behind one. But be the cab of any sort, So to the fair it conveys him— And if but here he makes her appear, To the peerage we will raise him! (Allegro)—“British Grenadiers.” [King] So talk no more of sorrow, And think no more of care, We'll hope to see to-morrow The Fair with Golden Hair. To wed King Lachrymoso, And dry the loyal tears— With a tow row row row row row row Of his gallant Halberdiers. Chorus. So talk no more. &amp;c. (Exeunt) Someone having suggested at the rehearsal that the King, Court, and Guards should dance off, the idea was adopted, and the practice has since become general in burlesques in similar situations.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. —A Meadow, with a stream flowing through it, over which hangs a tree. Enter Graceful. Grace. Provoking! Scarcely out of sight of town, My Patent Safety cab has broken down; D'ye call that Hansom? I don't, I must say. There's nothing for it but walk all the way! There's a short cut across these fields, I'm told, And so at once to take it I'll make bold. But stay—to grace my opening speech when there, A brilliant thought has struck me, I declare! I'll sit me down beside this running brook, And note it in my Punch's pocket-book. Then in its second year. (sits down on a bank; takes out pocket-book and writes) A large Carp leaps out of the stream and falls on the grass. Bless me, what's that? A carp, as I'm alive! And what a fine one—big as any five! It can't jump back again—what will it do? I never saw a carp in such a stew! Poor thing! if left there soon 'twill gasp its last; Thrown out, like me, it needs a friendly cast Upon its journey. Come, my friend, I'm sure You won't object to the cold water cure. So here you go—one, two, three, and away. Throws the Fish into the water—it sinks, but rises instantly, and says— Carp. Thank ye! I'll do as much for you some day. (disappears) Grace. It spoke! A talking fish! To such a wonder The singing mouse must instantly knock under. A fish that can talk sense—not like the silly Seal that but said “Pa-pa,” in Piccadilly. The “Singing Mouse” and the “Talking Seal” were novel exhibitions at that time. And so politely, too! At any rate, That fish has never been to Billingsgate. (a Crow heard without) Heyday! an eagle chasing a poor crow; The great oppress the little—where's my bow? Music—fits an arrow to his bow—the Crow flies across, pursued by an Eagle—he aims and fires at the Eagle—it falls dead. There, my poor bird, from danger you are freed. Crow. I'm berry much obliged to you, indeed. Grace. Mercy upon us! here's a talking bird! Crow. Ees, Graceful. Grace. Graceful! then my name you've heard. Crow. Who hasn't heard your name him like to know. Grace. What a particularly civil crow. Crow. And you know mine. Grace. Indeed! what is it? Crow. Jim. Grace. Jim Crow! Oh, yes, I've often heard of him. Song—Crow. Back to Virginia Him wish for to go, When great eagle follow him, And say, “Oho!” Turn about, and wheel about, And do just so!” Ebery time he turn about He hunt Jim Crow! Up come Massa Graceful, Wid him little bow, Kill him ugly eagle, Save him pretty crow! One good turn deserb Anoder, you know, So wheel about, and turn about, And trust Jim Crow! —Little Clark,” as he was usually called, a respectable actor for many years at the Haymarket, was very effective in this part. (Exit) Grace. My act was scarcely worth so much applause; It was the cause, my soul—it was the cause! When great strong birds would pluck the weak and small, They feather the just dart that bids them fall. So “on we goes again.” (going) (the whoop of an Owl is heard without) What means that cry? Some other helpless bird in jeopardy! Aye! (goes to wing, and drags forward part of a net) Here's a net, spread to catch heedless fowl, And in its meshes a poor purblind owl. Owl appears in net, at wing. Owl. Och hone! och hone! and sure you may say that, For I'm as blind by day as any bat. Grace. An Irish owl! no wonder at the noise! And one, too, who the power of speech enjoys! But after all that I've heard talk and sing, A chattering owl is no such wondrous thing. Owl. Och winisthru! what shall I do—o—o—o? Grace. Why, don't make such a horrid hubbaboo, And I will cut the net and let you fly. (cuts net) There, now—come out of that entirely. Owl. (coming out) St. Patrick's blessing on you for that same, Good Master Graceful. Grace. You, too, know my name! Owl. Och, sure, I'd know your voice, sir, any day; Haven't I often heard it at the play? Grace. You, at the play! Why, what could you there call? Owl. Der Freyschutz. I'm the ould original. Duet—Graceful and Owl—“Der Freyschutz.” Grace. How! indeed, are you then he, Whose great eyes I used to see? Sir, I beg your pardon, All my wonder now is o'er; Oft, of course, we've met before, When at Covent Garden. But where have you been, you rogue? For now you have got a brogue; Or my senses err, man, Owl. Faith and truth, I can't well say, But think I caught it, sir, one day, From my cousin German. But, sir, without any more botheration, You've laid me under a great obligation; And if, sir, to return it I don't haste, I'll give you leave to say, “that bird's a beast.” Incantation—“Der Freyschutz.” Grace. On your aid I may rely? Owl. U—hu—i! U—hu—i! Grace. How pathetic that reply! Owl. U—hu—i! U—hu—i! Grace. Me, he says, he will protect. Owl. U—hu—i! U—hu—i! Grace. Or words, at least, to that effect. Owl. U—hu—i! U—hu—i! Grace. Would that many songs we hear Had a meaning half as clear. Owl. U—hu—i! U—hu—i! (Exit) Grace. And apropos of songs, I've not yet thought On that by which the Fair One's to be caught. Oh, anything will do that's very tender, I know one has made many a maid surrender. And once to love a man let her determine, Woman's the same, in rags or royal ermine. Air—“I dreamed that I dwelt in marble halls.” There are ladies who dwell in marble halls And in their gilt coaches who ride; And women who stump it in pattens and shawls, Or get, of a donkey, outside. But let them sell apples, or rule the roast In a palace that I could name, I fancy between you and me and the post, When in love they are all much the same. (Exit)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Third. —Pavilion in the Gardens of the Palace of the Fair One with the Golden Locks. Enter Queen Lucidora, attended. Song—Lucidora—“Nora Creina.” Lucidora is my name, And Golden Locks my designation, Where I like's my dwelling place, And what I please, my occupation. King and prince, and duke, and earl, Beg to pay me their addresses; But I only smile, and curl With their notes my golden tresses. Oh, my golden tresses rare— My lovely, charming, golden tresses! Truefitt tries, with many dyes, But can't match thine, my golden tresses. Some of raven ringlets rave, Some rejoice in brown or flaxen, Some think best their head to shave, And sport a fancy-coloured Caxon. I know one who had a poll Grey as I have seen a parrot's, Bought a wash, the envious soul, And grew a crop of downright carrots. Oh! my golden tresses rare— My lovely, charming, golden tresses! Truefitt sighs, and vainly tries To match thy hue, my golden tresses. (speaks) Now to my toilet—nymphs, you know your places; Prepare to sacrifice unto the graces. Enter Papillotina. Papil. May't please your Majesty— Queen. I hope it may. Papil. There is a youth without— Queen. Without what, pray? Papil. Without the door. Queen. Well, let him keep without it; What business has he with it or about it? Papil. He prays an audience in his master's name King Lachrymoso. Queen. Why, sure, that's the same Who sent to me a day or two ago; Good gracious me! I told the creature “No!” Can't he be satisfied—or just go frantic— Or kill himself, or anything romantic? Papil. But this ambassador— Queen. Back let him roam. I'm dressing—I'm engaged—I'm not at home. Papil. Madam, if you'll permit me to advise, You'll see this gentleman—he has such eyes! And such a shape! and though not tall in stature, Graceful by name, he's graceful, too, by nature. Queen. Heyday! the fellow's cast some spell upon her; Pray is this language for a maid-of-honour? I'm quite ashamed of you, I do declare. “Such eyes,” indeed! I wonder how you dare Talk of a young man's eyes! a girl like you! I'll see this person; if your tale be true, He is a dangerous fellow, and must be Looked after. Papil. (aside) By the women, certainly. Queen. Go, tell the porter to admit the dandy. Papil. I fly! (Exit) Queen. And now, my handmaidens, be handy! Dust down my throne, polish my ivory chair, Weave me, of flowers, a chaplet fresh and fair, Bring me my bracelets, and my chatelaine, My kerchief scent with bouquet de la Reine, My regal mantle o'er my shoulders throw, And comb my precious hair out—comme il faut! Air and Chorus—“Come 'e gentil”—“Don Pasqual e.” [Queen] Comb it genteelly, And let it flow freely, I'd fain look well, Since he sends a swell. My shoulders o'er, Falling a yard or more, He'll matchless swear, The Fair with the Golden Hair. And softly o'er us, The while we parley, O sing the chorus From “Don Pasquale.” That music's spell May charm his ears as well; And he, and he Enchanted quite may be. Chorus. To tambour and guitar sing, While they parley, The serenade so sweet from “Don Pasquale.” Enter Graceful and Papillotina. Grace. Most royal fair— (aside) I never saw such hair— (aloud) I come to tell— (aside) Such speaking eyes, as well— (aloud) Your throne, before, Kneeling, I do implore— (aside) She's as fair as day! I scarce know what I say! Each look is fuel Added to my fire. O, fortune cruel! With love I shall expire. Chorus. To tambour and guitar, &amp;c. Queen. (aside) I've hit him hard! Grace. (aside) I never saw such beauty! But, Graceful, be a man and do your duty! Queen. When you can speak we'll hear what you've to say. Grace. Madam, my forte is singing. Queen. Sing away. Grace. (aside) She's proud and cold, as she is fair and nice! Perhaps this is but artificial ice! I'll break it by an effort energetic; I'll sing her something cruelly pathetic. Song—Graceful—“Lucy Long.” I pray, fair queen, be silent, And I'll sing you a little song; It's all about a mighty king, Who's loved you, lady, long. So take your time, Queen Luci- dora; only mind my song; You're the darling of this monarch, So don't make him wait too long. He is a perfect figure As ever you did see; He's handsomer and bigger A great deal, ma'am, than me. But take your time, Queen Lucidora; only mind my song, You're the darling, &amp;c. You said you wouldn't marry, When he asked you t'other day; You said you'd rather tarry, And he'll let you have your way. So take your time, Queen Luci- dora; only mind my song, You're the darling of this monarch, So don't make him wait too long. Queen. (aside) He is a pretty fellow, I confess. (aloud) Sir, I receive with pleasure this address, But to its prayer I cannot yet accede; I've made a vow no mortal suit to heed, Until three things are done which I desire. Grace. Oh, do but tell me, ma'am, what you require. Queen. Walking along the river-side, last spring, In taking off my glove I dropped my ring Into the stream; which, if you'll kindly fish for, And bring me back, is the first thing I wish for. Grace. (aside) A pleasant first! Queen. The second's quite a trifle— There is a giant, who has dared to rifle And kill and eat some hundreds of my people; He is almost as tall as a church steeple, And has the monstrous impudence to say, Unless I wed him, he'll eat me some day. Now, all I ask you in the second place Is to cut off his head. Grace. (aside) And she's the face To call that quite a trifle! Ma'am, I've heard Your two first small requests; pray what's the third? Queen. The third is rather difficult, I fear. Not far from hence there is a cavern drear, In which all sorts of dreadful monsters dwell! But deep within it is a crystal well, Of which the water has the virtue rare To make one live for ever young and fair. Now bring me of this eau-de-vie a bottle, Find me my ring, and cut the giant's throttle, And in return for such polite attention, I'll marry any gentleman you'll mention. Duo—“Ama tua madre”—“Lucresia Borgia.” Grace. Madam, with all humility I must beg leave to mention There's a little probability Of such a condescension. You ne'er are like to wed if all This must be done before— But I will go the whole animal, Let it be e'er such a bore! Let it be ever so dreadful a bore! Queen. Really this great civility, From such a total stranger— Doubtless with such ability You will surmount each danger. I've vow'd I ne'er will wed, if all This be not done before; So you must go the whole animal Or never come here any more, Or never, never come here any more. (Exeunt Graceful, Queen and Train)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fourth. —A Rum-antic Dell—The Mouth of a Cavern—a large Hollow Tree—between them a torrent. Enter Graceful. Grace. “In these sad solitudes and awful cells, Where heavenly pensive contemplation dwells, And ever musing melancholy reigns,” I come to cudgel my unhappy brains! To use a phrase of Mr. Samuel Slick's— I'm in a most tarnation ugly fix! If I don't win the fair one, in his fury The King will hang me without judge and jury. And if I stay to win her, as she wishes, My mildest fate will be to feed the fishes; Fancy me looking for a lady's ring Dropped in the river one fine day last spring; To fobb me off this is a mere pretence, And ring-dropping's a criminal offence! Fate has determined all my hopes to dish! (going) Voice. Stop, Graceful! Grace. (turning) Ah! who calls? Carp. A grateful fish. The Carp rises from the water, with a ring in its mouth. Grace. My friend the carp! and in its mouth I see A golden ring!—yes—no—it cannot be! Carp. It can—it is the one you're sent to find. Grace. Was ever anything so very kind? Carp. Take it. You threw me back into the brook, When others would have helped me with a hook! To help you in return I've hastened gaily— Although a fish, my conduct ne'er was scaly. Farewell, we're quits. I hope, and all my fry do, That you'll go on as swimmingly as I do. (disappears) Grace. I'm so o'erjoyed, I scarce know what I'm at! Who'll call a fish cold-blooded after that? How wrong it was in me to carp at fate. Here's the first task performed, at any rate! And “well begun's half ended,” runs the saying. But the next job on hand is giant slaying! In that no carp can help me, for alack! To kill a giant it should be a Jack. At the bare thought I tremble, for I've read That giants grind one's bones to make their bread. Well, if on me he tries such baker's tricks, The only way's to stick to him like bricks! This way, they tell me, he is sure to come; I think I hear him now cry— Gali. (without) Fee—fo—fum Enter Galifron. Grace. Oh, murder! here he is! Gali. Who's that below? Grace. (aside) It's no use flinching. (aloud) One, if you must know, Who's sent to fetch your head. Gali. A strange direction! When you can reach it, I have no objection. Grace. Come on! Gali. Come up! I'll make short work with you! (makes a blow at him with his club) Grace. (avoiding the blow) Hit one of your own size, you coward, do. Music—TheCrow appears in the tree just above Giant's head. Crow. Hit Massa Graceful! Den me do just so. (pecks the Giant's eyes out) Gali. Oh, oh, oh! He's pecked my eyes out! the vile carrion crow. Music—Strikes about blindly—Graceful hacks his legs, till he falls, then cuts off his head. Grace. I'm conqueror! Yet still with fear I shudder! Crow. Me tell you one good turn deserb anoder. Grace. By Jove, you came just in the nick, old fellow; And I may say of you, as of Othello— If virtue no delighted beauty lack, My friend Jim Crow is far more fair than black. Crow. We tink we both may now crow ober him. Ta, ta! (disappears) Grace. Farewell, my old acquaintance, Jim. That honest crow's an honour to his State; He pays his debts and don't repudiate. The “repudiation” here alluded to is now a matter of history. There's number two; but now for number three. Where shall I find this wondrous eau-de-vie? The Fair One vowed 'twas in a cavern drear Not far from hence—I rather think 'tis here. Music—Approaches cavern—Serpents and Monsters of different descriptions shew themselves—He retreats alarmed. Oh lud, yes, that's the cave without a doubt, By all those horrid monsters rushing out. That Black-gang-chine alarms me, I must own, If there's the well—I'll just let well alone. But then I lose the lady, and that's ill! Is there no bottle imp, who mine will fill? Music—The Owl appears in the hollow of the tree. Owl. May be an owl could manage that to do; If you've forgotten me, I haven't you. Grace. Forgotten thee! “While memory holds a seat In this distempered brain—” Owl. There, don't complete The passage. I'm contint, and faith, I'll fill Your whiskey-bottle from that private still. Music—Graceful hangs the bottle round the Owl's neck—he flies into the cavern. Grace. Kind bird, I hope no mischief will befall him. Should some terrific monster meet and maul him— But no, my heart with hope is gaily beating, An Irish owl don't mind a “monster meeting.” And all has gone so well with me as yet— Music—The Owl returns, with bottle filled. Owl. There, sir, you freed me from the fowler's net— There's the net profit of your kind behaviour. Grace. You've struck a balance greatly in my favour. Who comes this way? the Fair with all her train! Music—Enter Queen Lucidora and Train. Queen. Can it be possible? the giant slain! Grace. Yes, madam, there's his head—and there's your ring— And here's the water from the magic spring. Queen. I'm thunderstruck! our confidence has lost us! Are you the devil, sir, or Dr. Faustus? Grace. Neither, sweet saint, if either thee displease. Queen. Nonsense! you couldn't do such things with ease, If you were a mere mortal—and alone. Grace. The only charms I know of were your own; They have more power than imp, or fairy elf. Queen. (aside) I vow, I'm quite in love with him myself. Grace. And now I claim thee for my royal master. Queen. (aside) O, fatal promise! Unforeseen disaster! (aloud) My word's my bond, sir—I admit your claim— But is there no one else that you could name? Grace. The service and the loyalty I owe Compel me, gracious Queen, to answer “no.” Glee—“The Chough and Crow.” Grace. (aside) The carp and crow away have gone, The owl sits in yon tree; And I might sit upon a throne If I'd no probity. Her wildfire glances scorch my heart, But honour whispers “nay”— (aloud) Come, 'rouse you, ma'am 'tis time to start If we'd get home to-day. Queen. (aside) Alas! that I my word must keep; Of youths he is the flower; And I in love have tumbled deep, I, who defied love's power. Bewildered quite, I hence depart Not caring where I stray, But something tells my tortured heart There'll be the deuce to pay. Giant's Head. (voce de teste) Nor legs nor body own I now, I'm cut off in my prime! And I'll be bound that boy will vow He thinks it no great crime! My bones must in this gloomy glen Now whiten day by day— A warning to tall gentlemen Who choose to walk this way. Chorus. Come, come, look smart, look very, very smart, 'Tis time we were away; Run, run, what fun, to-morrow's sun, Will see her wedding day. (Exeunt—the Head descends trap)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. —The King's Palace, as before. Enter King through arch. King. To be, or not to be? that is the question, Which long ere this he's popped for her digestion, Tell me, thou little oracle of love, (producing a dandelion) Tell me, if she I prize the world above, From fortune's wheel to my blest lot will fall. She loves me—(blows)—just a little—(blows) not at all. That's awkward! am I doomed to live and linger? Come what, come may! I'll ask my little finger! Oh, little finger, mind you tell me true. Will my fair one, by Graceful, be brought to? Yes—no—yes—no—yes! oh, supreme delight, I feel my little finger's in the right. (shouts and flourish without) Hark to those shouts! those trumpets! and those drums! Enter Viscount Verysoso and Count Pleniposo. She comes! my Lucidora! say she comes! Count. She does, my liege! King. I knew she could not fail. “Talk of the”—hem! the proverb's coarse and stale. Count. (half aside) I hope 'tis not prophetic. King. Eh! you spoke? Count. Nothing, my liege—or if, I did but joke. King. Joke! take care how you joke in such a case, Or, like your joke, you may be out of place. Enter Courtiers, after which Graceful, leading Lucidora and followed by her Suite. Grace. Great King, the lady of your love behold; She's yours, the Fair One, with the Locks of Gold! Vis. (aside) For locks, read lots, and I should like it better. King. Oh, Graceful, I shall ever be your debtor. Madam, I'm dazzled by your beauty bright; One eye is Bude's, the other Boccius' light! Two new applications for illuminating purposes. Permit me, madam (kisses her); oh, conserve of roses! What lips! and there's a nose, to put all noses For ever out of joint! and oh, that hair! Made of light gold! Count. (aside) As our last sovereigns were. King. But wherefore silent stands my dearest deary? Queen. My journey, sir, has made me faint and weary. King. Walk in—sit down—bed-chamber woman, ho! Enter Mollymopsa through arch. Your mistress to her own apartments shew. Ring when you're ready for the cold collation— To-morrow, sweet, shall see your coronation. Queen. E'en when you please, since you will have it so. Dear Graceful! take care of the bottle though. Exeunt Mollymopsa first—Lucidora, Suite and Courtiers follow through arch. King. Bottle! what bottle? Grace. Sir, to speak the truth, 'Tis an elixir, which eternal youth And beauty to the drinker gives. King. The deuce! Grace. 'Tis for her Majesty's especial use. But, notwithstanding it was so declared, To stop it at the Custom House they've dared. King. A drink, to give eternal youth and beauty! What sum could pay the ad valorem duty? Tell them to pass the bottle, and not tap it; I know their customs, rogues! but they shall nap it. (Exit Graceful) I'll ask the Queen if she a drop can spare one. Count. My royal lord— King. Well. Count. When you wed the Fair One Will Graceful stay at Court? King. Of course, you flat! Count. Indeed! King. Indeed! zounds, what d'ye mean by that? Is he not honest? Count. Honest! King. Ay! Count. Don't know. King. But what d'ye think? Count. Think! King. Here's a precious go! Repeat my words again, I'll knock you down. Tell me your thoughts, sir. Count. Not for half-a-crown! King. Ha, there's some screw loose, then. Why, dash my wig! Count. Beware, my lord, of jealousy! King. I twig. Count. Mind, I say nothing, sir, I only hint. Look to your wife—if she at Graceful squint, Just mind your eye—you heard her call him “dear.” King. And so she did. Count. I own I thought that queer. But I'm too bold— King. I hope she's not been bolder; If so, I'll make the house too hot to hold her. Count. And Graceful? King. Seize and drag him to a prison. I'll teach the rogue to prig what isn't his'n! Harkye, you've seen, if you have any eyes, Upon my table, stuff to kill the flies. Count. The German fly-water. King. Exactly so. When he's in prison, with that bottle go, Give him a dose of it upon the sly. Count. That will be murder— King. Never mind. Count. Not I. My friend is dead—'tis done at your request. But let her live. King. Perhaps that would be best. Duo—King and Count—“La ci darem la mano.” Count. “La ci darem la mano,” Which means your fist tip me; You know I can't say “Ah, no” To you, your Majesty. King. Politic Pleniposo, I'm easy on that score, But frail my spouse to know so! It cuts me to the core. Count. Her voice is all falsetto. King. Each word's a sharp stiletto! Count. He would your life cut short— King. I Wish he of lives had forty! Count. Piano!— King. Forty!— I'd take 'em one by one, O! And to prolong the fun, O! Each dying scene encore! King. (Together.) I'd take 'em, &amp;c. Count. (Together.) He'd take 'em, &amp;c. Count. He comes. King. My guards. Enter Guards, Chamberlain, Courtiers, Mollymopsa, Lucidora, and Suite. Count. (aside) O, vengeance! (Exit) Vis. What's the row? Grace. (to Lucidora) I've cleared the bottle. King. Clear yourself, then. Grace. How? King. To prison with him, since he can't reply. Grace. What have I done? King. What can that signify? Hence with him—stay, give me that bottle first. Queen. What is he guilty of? I'll know the worst. King. You take uncommon interest in his fate. Perhaps you love him? Queen. Much as you I hate. All. O, rash confession! Queen. You're a tyrant!—he The very nicest young man that can be! Ensemble—King, Queen, Graceful, and Court—“Pen and Ink Polka.” King. Here's a go! Treason ho! Let the doors be locked all! Ladies and Gents. Lack-a-day! well-a-way! We're extremely shocked all! King. Seize the wretch! Let Jack Ketch Take him by the throttle! (Guards seize Graceful) Grace. Of this precious bottle Somebody take care. (Mollymopsa takes it from him) Queen. Tyrant, hold! My locks of gold I'll cut and sell to pay his ransom! Grace. Madam, don't! I beg you won't! My life is hanging by that hair. King. She would shave her head to save That traitor's whom she think's so handsome. Dread my wrath! Queen. Oh, go to Bath, And get your head shaved there! King and Court. Here's a go, &amp;c. Lack-a-day, &amp;c. King. He shall swing, on a string, Without judge or jury. Tremble at my fury! I'm as savage as a bear! Queen and Grace. Why, sir, all this fury, pray? He's/I'm innocent, swear! Guards drag Graceful off—Lucidora is carried off, fainting —Mollymopsa runs out with the bottle. King. She owns she loves him—I shall choke with rage; To a great king prefer a paltry page. Haply, for I take snuff, she thinks me dirty; Or, for I'm on the shady side of thirty. But that's not much, I'm only thirty-four. Ha! the elixir, that can youth restore! One draught will make me quite a boy again, And my face handsome, were it even plain. They've placed it in her dressing-room, no doubt; Suppose I just steal in when she comes out. But then suppose she hasn't drawn the cork, Well, can't I get a corkscrew or a fork? As if to broach a pint of Allsop's pale. This deed I'll do before this purpose fail. (Exit)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Sixth. —A Corridor in the Palace. Enter Mollymopsa. Mol. Was ever maid in such a desperate case. As sure as can be, I shall lose my place. The bottle I was told to take such care of, Is broken into bits, there's not a pair of. What shall I do? I certainly did stop To try if I could sip a little drop. But oh, the cruel spite of fortune see, The bottle had a drop instead of me. (shews neck of magic bottle) If I knew where another could be bought, But there, I'm sold. O Gemini, a thought! In the King's study I have surely seen One of this shape, and just this colour'd green. What's in it, goodness knows—but something nice, No doubt, as it's the King's, so in a trice I'll fetch it, slip over the neck this label, And place it on my lady's dressing-table. (Exit) Song—Mollymopsa—“The Last Rose of Summer.”. 'Tis my chance, and somehow Or other, if blown On my courtly companions The blame may be thrown. No page of the back stairs, No usher is nigh, To see me with that bottle, Brush off on the sly. At least if found out, and Discharged I should be, Some ladies, I trust, will Take warning by me; And though it be simply Of eau-de-cologne, Drop the habit of cracking A bottle alone. Enter King. King. I tremble so, I know not what's come o'er me— (starts) Is this a corkscrew that I see before me? The handle towards my hand—clutch thee I will! I have thee not—and yet I see thee still! Art thou a hardware article? or, oh! Simply a fancy article, for show. A corkscrew of the mind—a false creation Of crooked ways, a strong insinuation! I see thee yet, as plain as e'er I saw This patent one, which any cork can draw! (shewing patent corkscrew) Thou marshal'st me the way that I should choose, And such an instrument I was to use! There's no such thing; 'tis what I steal to do, That on my fancy thus has put the screw. I go, and it is done. (going) Confound it! there's That stupid Mollymopsa on the stairs. Enter Mollymopsa, cautiously—as she enters the King slips out unseen. Mol. Of my sad smash I've swept up every trace, And put the other bottle in its place. The Queen! I tremble to appear before her. And this way comes the captive. Enter Guards, Graceful, Queen Lucidora, and Suite, Viscount. Grace. Lucidora! Queen. Lead me, my virgins, lead me to that voice; I am not married, and he is my choice! Drag not this gentle gentleman to jail, I'll find two housekeepers to be his bail. I'm one myself—a queen, whose debts all paid are. Grace. Hear this, ye Gods! and wonder how you made her! Officer. To bail he cannot be admitted. Queen. No! Then I'll to prison with him. King. (within) Help, there, ho! (Exit Viscount) Queen. What voice was that? Grace. My royal master's surely. Re-enter Viscount. Vis. Run for a doctor, the King's taken poorly. Exeunt Officer and Viscount. Queen. The cramp has seized his conscience, I presume. What business has he in my dressing-room? Re-enter Viscount, with bottle. Vis. Oh, horror! horror! Madam— Enter Courtiers from different entrances. Queen. Well, proceed. Vis. His Majesty is very ill, indeed. (two Courtiers exeunt) Drunk something that has with him disagreed, Out of this fatal bottle. (shews bottle) Queen. Ha! made free, With my superior patent eau de vie! But some one must have changed it, for look here, 'Tis thick as ditch water! Grace. That's very clear! Queen. Where could he find this composition muddy? Enter Count, pale and agitated. Count. The fly water is missing from the study! Grace. The German fly-water beyond a doubt. (Mollymopsa comes forward and falls at Queen's feet) Mol. Oh, madam, pardon me, the murder's out! I chanced the other bottle just to crack— Count. Ha! bind the traitress on the bottle rack. Queen. Stay—'twas an accident—she didn't mean— Grace. Look, the King comes, his courtiers borne between. The King is borne forward in an arm-chair by the two Courtiers. Count. How fares your Majesty? King. Poisoned! Ill fare! I loved a lady who had golden hair; And she has set my heart on fire—I burn!
