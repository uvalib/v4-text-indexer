      <field name="fulltext">PART I. SCENE I. The AppeninesâMountains, the tops of which are covered with snowâin various places bearing all the appearance of luxuriant vegetationâin others hanging woods of mountain-ash, fir, and pine, and avalanches of snow and rock falling into cataracts and waterfalls, terminating in a lake, over which a Swiss bridge is thrown; nearer the audience, a fire lighted under a projecting rock in a narrow dell.âRinaldo discovered seated in a musing attitude over the fire, drawing, on his tablets; his dog basking beside himâAltaverde at a distance observing himâthunder, lightning, &amp;c. the clouds dark, and the moon obscured. AIRâALTAVERDE. Whilst boisterous winds our Alpine snows deform, Like one entranc'd, why six'd those piercing eyes? Rinaldo rise! hark!âhoarser howls the storm, Chieftain, CompanionâRinaldini rise! Can Love thus pierce the rugged Robber's heart, Will bold Rinaldo Cupid's votary prove? Rouze, join our band, arm instant and depart, Gold, brave-earn'd gold, will heal the wounds of Love. Exit. Rinaldo throwing his cloak round him, still keeps his eyes fixed on the tablet, and his hand employed in finishing the drawingâa sudden gust of wind is heard, and an old man hurries on, trembling with cold and alarm, a staff in his right hand, in his left a lanthorn, the light extinguished.âRinaldo throws off his cloak, starts up, and grasps his pistols, demanding his name and errand? RECITATIVEâOLD MAN. My lamp extinguish'd by the boisterous wind, Bewilder'd, bending to a Stranger's will,â Permission to illume it were thought kind, By the Old Man of Oriolo Hill. Rinaldo raising him, complies with his request, then orders him to depart.âHe bows, and retires. RECITATIVEâOLD MAN. The Cottage not far off, where 'lone I dwell, At your approach will shelter youâfarewell!âExit. Rinaldo thanks him, muses, gazes with rapture on the object he has drawn, and kisses it.âEnter from behind Florella (an amazonian of his troop) cleaning her pistolsâshe starts at seeing him so intent on the tabletâapproaches him, he conceals it, but welcomes herâshe demands what has engaged his attention? âMusquetry fired withoutâa shout, and bugle hornâthe clouds disperse, the moon appears, and Altaverde is seen meeting Cinthio and Robbers descending the mountainsâthey approach, form a semicircle round Rinaldo, and saluting him, place their plunder, in trophies, before him.âCinthio presents him a handsome miniature, the case of which in opening he lets fall; struck with its resemblance to that he had drawn, tears the latter from his tablets, kisses the miniature, and places it near his heart.âFlorella views this action with jealous emotion, snatches up the drawing, and discontentedly retires.âA whistle is heard, Paolo enters, and tremblingly displays the following placard: Rewards offered for Rinaldo's Head. Venice â 2000 Sequins. Genoa â 2000 Ditto. Lucca â 2500 Ditto. Rinaldo, treating the rewards with ineffable contempt, takes from his belt several Purses, and disperses amongst his Troops presents to twice their amount. They hack the placard with their poynards to atoms; Rinaldo then orders them to regale, and after drinking their captain's health, A RIFLE DANCE commences, in which the Banditti manÅuvre with their carbines, introducing the PLATOON EXERCISE, &amp;c. during this he appears busied writing, and at the conclusion gives Altaverde a paper on which is written âGeneral orders,â calls the band around him, and commands him to read it. RECITATIVEâALTAVERDE. Our general Orders, be it understood, Is glorious plunder!âdeath if any fly;â But he who wantonly sheds human blood, Whate'er his plea, Rinaldo dooms to die!â Paolo, aside, murmurs at the latter part, the others huzza! bending in acquiescence to Rinaldo's will; and having armed themselves, he takes the lead, and marches them over the mountains.âMulo (Baron Rovezzo's French Valet) enters terrified, approaches the fire, and takes with fear a gulp of the wine the Robbers had left; the Baron following with his sword drawn, and prince Rosella bringing up the rear; they intimate they have been plundered of all; the Baron regretting most the loss of a miniature (of which he there finds the case) as does Mulo his hat, which finding he proudly claps on his head, and, vapouring, threatens to destroy the Plunderers were they but there.âThe robbers' distant march is heard, and Rinaldo seen leading his troop over the more distant hills.âThe Baron, &amp;c. precipitately exeunt. SCENE II. Outside of Donato's Hermitage, partly hewn out of the rock, and backed by mountains; the cottage extends about two thirds of the stage, the remainder is occupied by pines and firs, constituting an avenue of cut trees supposed to lead to the monastery of St. Clare; under the hermitage window is a lodge for the reception of Charity, over it written âDate obolum.ââTime sun rise. Enter Donato listening to the chimes of St. Clare âAurelia appears winding through the avenue, netting, and, timidly approaching him, presents a letter, the purport of which is, âPrepare to espouse the Baron Rovezzo;â as he peruses it, she sighs!âEnter Florella with Rinaldo's tablet, compares Aurelia with the drawing, and stamping on it in disgust, breaks it into innumerable fragmentsâa bugle horn sounded without!â Donato invites Aurelia into his hermitageâFlorella perceiving Rinaldo approaching, hurries up the avenue âRinaldo enters, giving orders to two or three Robber-Chiefs, and pointing to the charitable appeal attached to the hermitage, desires them to place wine and fruits there, intimating to Cinthio that in the attached avenue he first beheld the object of his adoration âa voice is heard withoutâthey separate, Rinaldo entering the avenueâRosalia comes on singing. Who will purchase good luck, cross my hand, try the spell, Rosalia, the Gypsey, your Fortune will tell. As she passes the Hermitage, Aurelia through the window, beckons her, to have her fortune told; Rosalia perceives Rinaldo, and eyes both significantly âAurelia comes cautiously from the hermitage, Rosalia examines her palm, and sings. BALLADâROSALIA. 1. As sounded late the Convent bell, fal, lal, la, You wander'd forth your beads to tell, fal, lal, la; But as you stray'd, Thro' yonder glade, Chance led your steps you knew not where, 'Till as by magic conjur'd there: Kneeling before you did appear, fal, lal, la, A handsome unknown Cavalier, fal, lal, la. Rinaldo approaches, enraptured, but fearful of alarming her. BALLAD continued. 2. Tho' frown'd your brow, yet smil'd your heart, fal, lal, la, And this said stay, tho' that depart, fal, lal, la; Your hand he seiz'd, Knelt, tortur'd, pleas'd, You, struggling, freedom did regain, And fledâyet wish'd to be o'erta'en: Yet still perhaps, may lurk too near, fal, lal, la, That handsome unknown Cavalier, fal, lal, la. Pointing towards Rinaldo, she retires, while Donato, issuing from the Hermitage unperceived, hurries Aurelia into itâFlorella detaining Rinaldo, whom she had angrily seized by the wrist, he breaks from her, compells her to leave him, and follows Donato. SCENE III. Inside of the Hermitage, rustic folding doors in the centre, leading to another apartment; two antique tables, one covered with black baize, on which is a large book and crucifix; chairs, &amp;c. through the folding doors are painted on the back flat a portrait of Aureliaâthe folding doors are closed. Enter Donato, welcoming Rinaldo, whom he requests to be seated; places wine and fruits before him.âRinaldo perceives a piece of netting on the table and eagerly enquires whose work it is? but not obtaining a satisfactory answer throws open the folding doors, beholds the portrait of Aurelia!â Fills a glass and drinks to it on his knee, and, perceiving an inner door leading to a garden, rushes through, in spite of the old man's endeavours to the contrary, closing the folding-doors after him.âFatigued, Donato throws himself into a chairâa crash is heard, as of breaking into the Hermitage, and Paolo enters, demands his purse, drinks his wine, and strikes him to the earth, other ruffians rushing on to his whistleâat this instant Rinaldo bursts open the folding doors, and angrily re enters, followed by Aureliaâa pauseâhe demands who has committed this outrage?âthey all disclaim share in it, and point to PaoloâAurelia flying to the assistance of Donato âRinaldo discharges a pistol which terribly wounds him, and his comrades bear him off.âHe then approaches and cheers the old man, (and tenderly attentive to Aurelia) casts himself at her feetâshe gently raises him, sighs, and bids him depart, for she is destined to become another's, which Donato corroberates, and, Rinaldo recollecting he is a robber, determines to conquer his passion.âMens voices are heard calling âDonato,â (the old man) informs him, they are Aurelia's Father and intended Husband, and intreats him to withdrawâhe acquiesces. âThe Prince and Baron enter, Rinaldo crosses them bowing majestically; but meeting Mulo (who follows) with a frown, compells him to give wayâ Cinthio's bugle is sounded without, and with a stifled sigh, and look of anguish Rinaldo departsâDonato introduces Aurelia, who kneels to her Father, he raises her, and presents her to the Baronâthe latter having had his eyes fixed on Rinaldo, asks, suspiciously, who he is!âAurelia avows ignoranceâand he seizes her hand, exclaiming. RECITATIVEâROVEZZO. Our Marriage must be brief, e'en now the Feast, With all our Castle's splendour we prepare; 'Ere Night dew falls, bless'd by the Holy Priest, Your Sire consigns you to a Husband's care.â Exeunt. SCENE IV. Gypsies Hut. Several Gypsies enter, bearing provisions, &amp;c. GYPSIES GLEE. By the moon's silver beams, Elves and Fairies delight; Anear chrystal sheams, To revel the night: While around the crackling firewood we jolly Gypsies lay. There each toasts his black ey'd lass, Bold swells the sportive glee; And gingling glass for glass, Carouses merrily, merrily. 'Till the bright Sun announces the dawning of day, Then rising from his mossy bed, pursues his wandering way. Singingâti ri la, ti ri la, ti ri la, lal ley. Re-enter Rosalia, a guitar slung across her shoulder, Gypsies sternly demand the donations she has received, chide her for their being small, and hurry her, the Females, and Children into their hut while they unpack their hamper, in doing which, among the provision they find a proclamation similar to that in the first Scene, and conclude, could they seize Rinaldo it would make their fortuneâwhile debating, Paolo enters, faint with loss of bloodâthey start, drop the scroll, and learning he had been wounded by Rinaldo, relinquish the idea of attempting his seizureâFlorella enters, and on being made acquainted with the event, urges him on to vengeance, and insuring them success, they all bind themselves to the undertaking, and, perceiving their victim drawing near, conceal themselves in the Hut. Enter RinaldoâPaolo and Florella diffidently approach him, each apparently regretting the having offended, and soliciting his pardonâduring which, with uplifted poignards on each side, the Gypsies steal behind to assail himâRosalia, peeping from the Hut, perceives them, and screamsâRinaldo grasping his pistols, presents one at the head of eachâ Paolo and Florella, abashed at the frustration of their design, sneak off, the Gypsies (grouping) solicit mercyâRinaldo drives them offâRosalia throws herself at his feetâhe raises her. BALLADâROSALIA. [1.] A poor orphan Gypsie I haunt grove and dale, And tell to the list'ning winds my sad tale; Your pity bespeak as I wander along, And charity's boon is the theme of my long. Bestore your charityâgive a poor little Orphan, A Criutzer for charityâ(Rinaldo throws her a purse, which she catches curtseying) Benevolence gives Fortune-telling it's spell, And thus my hand cross'd, I your fortune will tell. You're a Lover I know, 'Tis declar'd by your eyes; Your cheeks burning glow, And those half stiffled sighs. And kind is the nymph you adore, Excelling the fairest, of those who excel; Well I say nothing more, But I know a little Maid who co'd love you as wellâ 2. By cruelty goaded, but sorry's my cheer, My hard crust is moisten'd full oft with a tear; The tale of my woes wo'd your heart rend in twain, Then let not this hand be extended in vain. Bestow your charityâgive a poor little Orphan, A service for charityâ(she kneels, he raises her); Good humour to diffidence serves as a spell, And thus my accomplishments boldly I'll tell. I can cook, make a bed, As your Valet engage; Your Nurse sho'd you need, Or compleat little page. To carry a message to her you adore, Excelling in Love those who others excel; Well, I say nothing more, But you view a little Maid, who can love you as well. Exeunt. SCENE V. Exterior of the Baron's Castle, situated on a Lake, from the mountainous side of which a draw-bridge leads, and communicates with the entrance to a projecting Tower or Prison, with grated windows, and iron-plated door, and surrounded with spiked palisadoesâopposite the Tower, on the nearer side the lake to the audience, Ruins of an Abbey; in the centre of the lake, a large ancient decayed Willow; the lower gates, leading to the Court Yard of the Castle, occupy the right wing nearly fronting the Abbey Ruins. Enter Rinaldo, followed by Rosalia, he bearing a small bundle, which, exchanging with her for her guitar, he tells her to retire with amid the ruins, and equip herself in male attireâtouching the strings playfully, his attention is arrested by a trumpet, which he perceives appertains to the Baron, and retires.âEnter the Prince and Baron, leading on Aurelia, followed by Vassals, preceded by Mulo, who assumes much consequence.âTrumpets again sound, and the Castle gates are thrown open by Antonio and Domestics, who obsequiously welcome home their Lord.âThe Prince Roscella now surrenders his daughter, with his blessing, to the Baron, and affectionately takes leaveâshe bursts into tears, at which the Baron appears enraged, and, clapping his hand to his sword, dispatches Antonio for a Priest. Rinaldo at that moment appearing, she screams, and faints into his armsâenraged, the Baron commands his absenceâhe refusesâthey drawâAurelia (reviving) endeavours to separate themâthe Baron is disarmed, as is Rinaldo, by the aid of Mulo and Domestics, who seize him, while Aurelia is hurried through the Castle gatesâRinaldo, dashing from his assailants, throws down his gauntlet, and challanges the Baron, who, entering the Castle, closes the gates on him with contemptâRinaldo, snatching up the glove, vows âin that Castle he will compell him to render satisfactionââwhile musing, Rosalia enters, habited as a Page, and is suddenly surrounded by Altaverde and RobbersâRinaldo starts, recognizes and introduces her to his party; but, perceiving Mulo approaching towards the Tower above, bids them silently disperse, till Rosalia's guittar, which he presents her, shall recall them. Aurelia is hurried on (above) by Mulo, imprisoned in the Tower, and left there till the arrival of the Priest. Rinaldo, perceiving this, swears to release her, places Rosalia on the watchâmuses on the meansâascends the Abbey Ruins, from a jutment of which, leaping, he gains the withered Willow in the lake, and, with much labour, bending the boughs with his weight, so as to nearly reach the palisadoes, springs over them, and gaining the door of the Tower, with his dagger, bursts it open; but, as he is cautiously leading the timid Aurelia towards the draw-bridge, a trumpet sounds from the mountains, Rosalia gives a signal of approach, and perceiving Antonio, the Priest, and an escort near, he hurries Aurelia again into her Prison.âMulo appears, lowers the draw-bridge, which the Priest, &amp;c. cross, and opening the door of the Tower, Aurelia, in tears, is lead off into the Castle, the bridge being first drawn up.âMulo finds a difficulty in locking the door, and continues behind; during his endeavours Rinaldo darts from the Tower, fixes him in his situation, and locks the door on him, exultingly displaying his keys as the means of admittance into the Castleâat this moment Rosalia again appears on the opposite sideâhe motions her to strike her guitar, while he gently lowers the draw-bridge. SOLO AND GLEE. Rosalia, Altaverde, and Banditti. Ros. Yes, yes, yes: I'll gently touch the blythe Guitar, Ting a ting a ting, right warily! Our gallant Band anear and far, Will hail their Minstrel chearily! Ting a ting tang, ting a ting tang! For Beauty's rescue none will aid deny, And hark! softly, row de dow, dow, Their ready drums reply! Ting a ting tang! none will aid deny. All. Row de dow dowâour ready drums reply. (Their Drums without softly answer the Guitar, and the Banditti gradually appear.) Cho. Row de dow, &amp;c. (Rinaldo motions silence.) Solo. Ros. Hushâsilence has our Chief decreed! Cease, cease to beat the ready, ready drum, To the dying Breeze with noiseless tread, Whisper the watchword, mumâmumâmum! They gently cross the draw-bridge, and enter the Castle. SCENE VI. Court Yard of the Castle, a flight of steps, with balustrades, &amp;c. leading to the Banquet Hall. Enter attendants, who pass backward and forward with Fruit, &amp;c. into the Hall, preparatory to the Marriage Festivalâthe Baron gloomily descends the steps, and gives orders for their attendance on him to dress, &amp;c.âAurelia is brought down the steps by the Priest, &amp;c. and given to Female attendants to adornâBaron, &amp;c. exeunt, Antonio and Marghereta remain. RECITATIVE. Ant. How glum he looks!â Mar. âAh! poor dear lady!â Ant. Yes, Parson Domine will soon say grace! Mar. She's doom'd to misery I'm sure already, Ant. Doom'd to endure the conjugal embrace. DUET. [1.] He. Of all the days allotted to Man, Since he in his cradle bedding lay; If e'en to old age be extended his plan, The day of all days is a wedding day. She. It dawns with delight, Does to pleasure invite, Each gay blooming lass and her smart dapper fellow; Their bosoms elating, A fond couple mating, Caro Sposa creating of little Donzella. He. The Priest they approach, with pit pat trepidation, She. And blush and look foolish 'till liberty's flown; He. When for freedom thus barter'd the sweet reparation, She. Is two loving Souls thus united in one. Then such bustle, friend and neighbour, He. Wishing joy with pipe and tabor, She. Music playing, minstrels singing, He. Mobs huzzaing, bells a ringing, Both. Toasting, feasting, courting, sporting, Laughing, quaffing, dancing, prancing, She. All to crown the celebration, He. Then the joys in expectation; To the day of my death I'll sing or I'll say, She. That the day of all days is a merry, merry, wedding day, Both. A merry, merry, wedding day. 2. He. Then it gives birth to festival fun, Which will to the feet from the head in play; She. Jokes cracking, lips smacking! as sure as a gunâ The day of all days is a wedding day. He. And joy to extend, why nine months end, She. Perhaps may give birth to a sweet little fellow; He. So blest the espousal, a christ'ning carousal, Again shall arouse all, and make them all mellow. She. Then the babe is admir'd, with pit pat expectation, He. And kinsfolk so kindly all lavish their praise; To the eye of the parent it gives animation, She. And renders the day one of Life's choicest days. Then such bustle, &amp;c. Exeunt. Rinaldo enters cautiously, followed by Altaverde, &amp;c. muffles himself in his cloak, and, requesting them to keep aloof till they hear his whistle, ascends the steps leading to the Banquet HallâAltaverde and Band retiring on the opposite side. SCENE VII. Interior of the Banquetting Hall brilliantly illuminated, backed by a rich Canopy, pending over Chairs of State, in the centreâon each side splendid Orchestrasâa picturesque Altar, adorned with a golden Crucifix, &amp;c. &amp;c. near the first entrance on the left handâthe entrance to the Hall, from above, by a flight of steps, in the second entrance on the right hand. Bands of Musicians discovered in the Orchestras, and Vassals in waitingâas the Scene opens a grand flourish of Instruments.âDancing Girls descend the flight of steps, and a Nuptial Procession takes place âthe Priest, attended by the Baron, leads Aurelia to the altarâshe throws herself at his feet, requesting a moment's pauseâthe Baron, enraged, commands him to do his dutyâshe solicits himâhe draws, and, pointing his sword to the Priest's breast, commands him to proceed, and a compulsotary union is on the point of taking place, when Rinaldo rushes into the Hall, throws down his gauntlet, and again challanges the Baron, who, surrounded by his friends, treats him with derision, and commands the Priest once more to proceed. Rinaldo snatches Aurelia from his graspâBaron, &amp;c. draw; pointing a pistol to his head, Rinaldo whistles, and his band rush on, each presenting his piece, and exclaiming, âViva Rinaldo.ââThe Baron, &amp;c. panic struck, drop on their knees, and solicit mercy, which Rinaldo (disarming them) with a sneer grants, and, gallantly bearing off Aurelia, gaily ascends, followed by his exulting Band.â Abashed, but irritated, the vanquished Baron calls his Friends and Vassals around him, and swearing them all to âRevenge,â thus addresses them. AIRâROVEZZO. Let proclamations spreading wide, Bid to our aid the black Avengers hie: 'Ere Sol shall arise to illumine the skies, Shall the traitress Aurelia's heart's blood, be our prize, And by art or by force Rinaldini die! CHORUS. 'Ere Sol shall arise, &amp;c. Exeunt. SCENE VIII. Exterior of the Convent of St. Clare. Enter Rinaldo and Rosalia, supporting the drooping Aureliaâshe requests to take shelter in her Convent, but he urges her to accompany himâhalf consenting, they are interrupted by the sudden appearance of her Father, who is driven on, nearly overpowered, by PaoloâRinaldo darts to his assistance, and the Ruffian is disarmed and driven offâ Aurelia, happy in her Father's safety, affectionately embraces him, and makes him acquainted with the Baron's cruelty, introducing to him in his deliverer, her ownâthe Baron's trumpet sounds withoutâall startâand for safety enter the Convent. Paolo, cautiously beckoning on Florella, returns, informs her there Rinaldo has concealed himself, and they determine (placing themselves on each side the gate) to dispatch him should he return over its threshold.âAs they are listening the Baron and followers enter, he orders them to be seizedâthey intimate they are on the watch for Rinaldo, and determined to dispatch himâthe Baron commends, and gives them gold, and learning Aurelia has taken refuge there, gives the following orders to his Band. To the North sound the trumpet, To the South blow a blast!â Our Ministers of Vengeance call, From East and from West. His trumpeters obey, and several members of the Black Tribunal enter in black masks and cloaks, they bow to the Baron, who selects one from the rest, bearing a dagger and halter, and giving him a slip of paper, on which is written the name of Aurelia, points to the Convent, and with his followers departsâthe member, apparently, cuts an incision in the Convent door, in which he places the following Citation: âAurelia is cited to appear before the Secret Avengers.â CHORUS OF MEMBERS. Before our Black Tribunal, 'ere the third day, draw near, Aurelia, th'associate of Robbers, appear! Appear, appear, appear! Exeunt. The Lady Abbess, Aurelia, the Prince, and Rinaldo dart through the door, and appear horror struck at perusing the Citationâthe latter attempts to console them, but Cinthio, suddenly entering, he is called thenceâhastily kisses Aurelia's hand, and presents her a ring, swearing he will soon return to her aid, and takes his leaveâthey return into the Convent; he hastily accompanies Cinthio off. SCENE IX. Practicable Mountains, from which a stupendous Waterfall precipitates itself, which, increasing, becomes a River, over which is a picturesque, arched, practicable Bridgeâon one side of the stage is Rinaldo's Tent, his dog on guard, under his banner âHands and Hearts united:â on the other, straggling Tents and Baggage Waggons. The Robbers discovered, some asleep, others keeping watch, &amp;c.âa whistle is heard, which is returned by Altaverde, and a Gondola rowed through the arch, in which is Rinaldo, Cinthio, and Rosaliaâthey landâa beacon is fired on the mountains, and a distant cannon heardâRinaldo startsâmusesâorders two boxes, one marked âSpecie,â the other âJewelsâ to be brought from his Tent, places them on board the Gondola, and commissioning Rosalia to bury them in a place of safety, it is again rowed off through the archâhe then, patting his Dog, seats himself in his Tent to carouze, snapping his fingers at the second report of a cannon âa distant trumpet heard, and Robber Centinel rushing over the bridge, informs them they are surrounded âthe Band fly to arms, which they scarce accomplish, when the Bridge is covered with the Baron's Soldiers, headed by him, Paolo, &amp;c. the mountains apparently covered with armed Men, and every pass obstructedâBaron's Troops halt, and display the following proclamation: âPardon and Rewards are offered the Band, if they will surrender their Chief.â Rinaldo, after saluting the Baron with his sword, reads it, and asks if they will surrender him, they answer âNo:ââhe snatches down the proclamation, tears it, and making wadding with it for his carbine, with that answers themâa general fight commences âseveral are killed on each side, and, at length, part of the balustrades of the Bridge giving way, Rinaldo is precipitated from thence by the Baron, &amp;c. into the Riverâhis Dog leaping in prevents him from sinking, till Rosalia comes to his assistance in the Gondola, which he is received on board, and escapes, unperceived, through the archâMulo, whose terror gives occasional humour to the Scene, comes forward, as the Baron, &amp;c. descend the Bridge, with Rinaldo's hat and sword, with the latter vowing he has dispatched him. CHORUS OF VICTORY. Be the name of Rovezzo extol'd o'er and o'er, The terror of Nations, Rinaldo's no more; Of his Band the remains, gnash their teeth, clank their chains, And the loss of Rinaldo in Death shall deplore: The wreath of Victory prepareâno more we live in awe, Let acclamations rend the airâhuzza!âhuzza!âhuzza! At the close of the chorus, Rinaldo and Rosalia, on the summit of the Bridge, wave the Robbers' banner, and join in the huzza!âtheir antagonists groupe in great consternation, and the curtain drops.

      <field name="fulltext">PART II. SCENE I. An open Quinquangular space, five Streets there meeting, St. Bartholomew's Cross and Fountain occupying the centre of the Stageâthe Streets and Cross illuminated. Enter Rosalia, followed by Rinaldo, who leans almost fainting on his staff, perceiving the fountain, she assists him towards itâthe water refreshes him, and he requests her to seek for food, while he there, worn out, reclines, and waits her returnâa bell tollsâhe starts up, and hastily conceals himself âenter in procession, by torch light, the Prince Roscella, Aurelia, the Abbess, and Nuns of St. ClareâBoys of the choir, &amp;c. following. CHORUS. Pale, trembling, the Agents of terror to meet, With heart piercing awe, we their vengeance await. Bell tollsâenter Ministers of Vengeance. DUETâNUNS. Hark! yon summons, deep tolls! like, alas! thy death bell! Aurelia, companion, forlorn one, farewell! We offer up for innocence a prayer; and shed a tearâ (Bell tolls. Ministers of Vengeance approach.) Min. Aurelia! thou Traitress! appear! appear! CHORUS repeated. Hark! yon summons, deep tolls, like, alas! thy death bell! Aurelia, companion, forlorn one, farewell! After taking an affectionate leave of her Father, she is borne off by the Ministers of Vengeanceâ Abbess, &amp;c. returning to their ConventâRinaldo comes forward, much agitated, solicits Roscella's sword, and follows Aurelia, determined to rescue her or die in the attempt. SCENE II. Ruins; appertaining to the Scene mysterious yawning chasmsâa practicable iron ladder, and a platform on which characters may pass, seen through an aperture in the Ruins. Enter Minister of Vengeance, indicates that those Ruins lead to the awful spot where the secret Tribunal meetâstamps four times, and another Minister appearsâwhile they are mysteriously consulting, Rinaldo cautiously enters, and, seeing others approaching with Aurelia, determines to explore their secret hauntsâshe is brought on, and blindfolded.â Rinaldo, while they are thus engaged, endeavours to steal in, but is preventedâthe Minister again stamps four timesâgong soundsâa chasm opens in the Ruins, and a ladder is lowered, which Aurelia is compelled to ascend, when it is suddenly drawn up, and the chasm closes on them, Rinaldo attempting, in vain, to follow!âThunderstruck, he wildly gazes on the scene, and perceives them, through an aperture, pass across behind the Ruins, which, with difficulty, he climbs up to, and forces himself through, the following strain being sung at the same time within: CHORUS OF SECRET AVENGERS. The Traitress Aurelia's heart's blood is our prize, And by art or by force shall Rinaldo die! SCENE III. Inside of a Vaulted Subterraneous Domeâover a Gothic Throne, a transparent blood-red cross, and radiated Eyeânear it a Gothic Table, on which is a large Book, which is lettered with âBook of Bloodââat the upper end of the Stage a half obscured Cell, over which is inscribed, âCondemned by the Secret Avengers,â and which discovers on opening, Skeletons, &amp;c.âon the opposite side flights of practicable steps. Rinaldo is discovered cautiously descending; on reaching the last step, a solemn bell distinctly tolls four timesâhe startsâreads the inscription, and, bursting open the door, beholds a variegated mass of human skeletonsâkneeling, to Omnipotence, he dedicates his sword to Justice and Revengeâthe toll of the bell is repeated, and he conceals himself in the Cell. Solemn March with muffled drums, a Procession of the Members takes place by torch light; and the President having taken his seat under the Cross, Aurelia is brought forward, her accusation to the following purport being inscribed on a banner placed opposite; âAurelia accused of Incontinence and Treason.â The gong soundsâher eyes are unboundâshe beholds with terror her melancholy prospect, and on her knees solicits mercyâthe President sternly approaches, and thus addresses her: To the plighted vows, false! what appeal canst thou make, To induce the Eternal's Avengers to save? (Throws off his black cloak and mask.) In Rovezzo behold thy Accuser and Judge, Death! death on the Traitress! a premature grave!â The Book of Blood is opened, and in blood-red letters is inscribed: âAurelia, guilty, Death!â She faintsâRinaldo, pallid, and breathless with agitation, steals from his hiding place, and, while they are busied in supporting Aurelia, disguises himself in the Baron's cloak and mask, and mingles with the rest.âThe Baron, unmoved by her prayers and tears, vindictively offering his dagger to the Executioner, commands her immediate sacrifice; Rinaldo officiously intrudes, and, snatching the dagger, solicits to officiate; he is commanded to be brief, the Minister of Vengeance being deputed to assist, and, steeling their hearts against every solicitation of their fair victim, the Avengers retire.âThe bell again tolls, the door of the cemetery flies openâRinaldo is ordered to âStrike;â but delays the blowâhis companion, impatient, unfeelingly up-raises his weapon; the falling blow is caught by Rinaldo, and the would-be executioner stabbed to the heartâhe falls! âRinaldo exultingly throws off his disguise, the Lovers embrace, bend in thankfulness to Heaven, and, ascending with trembling steps the entrance of the Cave, escape. SCENE IV. Outside of Paolo's Cave. Enter Florella, goes to the mouth of the Cave, stamps three times, and Paolo appears; she informs him Rinaldo approaches with Aureliaâthey conceal themselves.âEnter Donato (the Old Man of the Hill) whom Paolo, peeping out, perceives, and recollecting, him, the occasion of his disgrace and sufferings, pursues, determining to murder him!â Florella, on the lurk, is met by the Baron much irritated, and alarmed at Aurelia's escape, whom she informs is with Rinaldo hovering near, pointing off to themâhe startsâgives her a purse to keep them in view till his return, with aid; she promises compliance, motioning her detestation of them bothâ Paolo returns with his dagger bloody, and Donato's habit and rosaryâa thought strikes Florellaâshe requests their use, and they hurry with them into the Cave, dropping, in their haste, his blood-stained dagger.âRinaldo and Aurelia enter, meeting Roscella and Rosaria; they affectionately exchange embraces; and Roscella, thanking Heaven and Rinaldo for his Daughter's deliverance, joins their handsâRinaldo shudders, throws himself at his feet, and, drawing from his belt a proclamation, avows himself to be the daring Robber there proscribed! and, unworthy of so rich a prize, restores her to her Father, till penitence procures his pardon. Florella, disguised as Donato, approaches from the Cave, and bows to himâthe Baron's trumpet sounds withoutâalarmed, Rinaldo requests Aurelia, &amp;c. to seek for safety; he, determining to become an inmate of Donato's CaveâRoscella and Aurelia depart; Rinaldo follows Florella into the Cave, and Rosalia, exclaiming May Angels looking down from Mercy's throne, Grant thy Repentance may thy Crimes atone! stumbles over Paolo's dagger, which perceiving stained with blood, alarmed for Rinaldo's safety, she snatches up, timidly pursues his footsteps, and enters the Cave. SCENE V. Interior of the Cave, consisting of an upper Apartment, to which a flight of steps from above leads, which is parted from the landing place by a curtain drawn round it on an iron rod; from the landing place another flight of steps descends to the lower Apartmentâon one side of which is a gloomy recess, in which two or three Carbines, and a barrel of Powder are visibleâon the other a circular aperture, which gives light to another recess, Paolo's Dormitory; to which a passage, from the other recess, leadsâunder the aperture, on a rocky fragment, is a Couchâa Guitar hanging up. Rinaldo is discovered seated on the couch, his eyes fixed on Aurelia's miniature, otherwise insensible to all around himâFlorella and Paolo in the recess, viewing him with murderous intent, and fixing a bayonet to a carbine, while Rosalia is cautiously descending the first flight of stepsâhe heaves a sigh, rises, and comes forward; at the same moment Rosalia gains the upper apartment, and is hid by the curtainâPaolo retires further into the recess, and Florella officiously takes down the guitar, and offers it Rinaldo for his amusementâhe again seats himself, and commences playingâshe motioning Paolo round to stab him through the aperture above, through which she intimates the bayonet's length is equalâRosalia perceiving their actions, as he passes round, timidly descends into the lower apartment, and just as he is going to strike, screams! Florella, throwing off her disguise, points a pistol to her headâthe characters groupeâa pauseâ shout without, and Rovezzo, at the head of his Troops, rushes into the Cavernâcharacters again groupe, and Rinaldo is commanded to surrenderârefusesâ snatches Paolo's carbine; in the struggle it goes off, pointed towards the recess, and the Cavern blows up! âRovezzo, Paolo, and Florella falling the victims of their own malignity, and Rinaldo sinking wounded into the arms of Rosalia; on the effects of the explosion partly evapourating, the Ruins appear backed by SCENE VI. AND LAST. A Distant splendid Encampment. Roscella and Rosalia discovered on their knees before the Grand Duke of Tuscany, attended by Officers, &amp;c. soliciting Rinaldo's pardon, who, aided by Rosaria, faintly approaches, and throws himself at his feet, sighing forth: Wounded Rinaldo repentantâunforgivenâ Craves pardon for his Crimes of Man and Heaven! His pardon is grantedâthe Prince joins the lovers hands, and the characters forming an interesting groupe, the curtain drops to slow music. FINIS.</field>
