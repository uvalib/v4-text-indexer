      <field name="fulltext">ARTAXERXES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Artaxerxes, Prince, afterwards King of Persia, Friend of Arbaces, in love with Semira. Mandane, Sister to Artaxerxes, in love with Arbaces. Artaban, Commander of the royal guards, Father of Arbaces and Semira. Arbaces, Friend of Artaxerxes, in love with Mandane. Semira, Sister to Arbaces, in love with Artaxerxes. Megabyzus, General of the army, the confident of Artaban.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene lies in the city of Susa, the residence of the Kings of Persia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. An inner garden belonging to the Royal palace of the Kings of Persia. A prospect of the palace. Time, night: moonlight. Mandane, Arbaces. Arb. Farewell! Man. Arbaces, stay. Arb. Belov'd Mandane! The dawn is near; should Xerxes ever learn That 'gainst his harsh command I enter'd here, It little would avail in my defence To urge a lover's warmth; nor would the name Of daughter plead for thee. Man. Thy fear is just: This regal dwelling must for thee be dangerous. But yet thou may'st remain in Susa's walls; Since exil'd from the palace, not the city. Hope is not wholly lost: thou know'st thy father, The mighty Artaban, directs at will The heart of Xerxes; that to him 'tis given, At every hour, to pierce the deep recesses Of this imperial mansion; that my brother, My Artaxerxes boasts thee for his friend. In virtue and in fame you grew together, All Persia has beheld you partners still In danger's deeds: each from the other caught The emulative flame: the troops admire thee, The people even adore thee, and the kingdom Expects its surest safety from thy arm: Amidst such friends how canst thou fail support! Arb. Alas! my love, we but deceive ourselves: Thy brother would in vain attempt to aid me: He and my father are alike suspected, When they defend Arbaces: every plea Is heard with slow belief, when warmly urg'd By partial friendship, or paternal fondness. And for the inconstant herd of vulgar friends, These shrink, when once the monarch's favour fails. How many that with awe but late beheld me, Now look on me with scorn! Where then, Mandane, Where would'st thou have me hope? My dwelling here Is danger to thyself, and pain to me. To thee 'tis dangerous, as it adds new matter To feed suspicion in the breast of Xerxes: To me 'tis painful to be ever near thee, Yet be denied to gaze upon thy beauties. Since then my birth alone has made me guilty, I'll die, or merit theeâmy life! farewell. [going. Man. Inhuman, canst thou leave me thus? Arb. Alas! I am not inhuman: Xerxes is the tyrant: Thy father is unjust. Man. Yet some excuse Even he might claim when he denied my hand: Our rank, the world, the distance plac'd between us: Who knows but all his anger was dissembled? Perhaps in secret he condemn'd his rigour. Arb. He might have yet refus'd to grant my suit Without contempt: to drive me from him thus, To treat me like the lowest of the vulgar; To stile me base, presumptuousâsuch reproach I feel, Mandane, at my inmost heart. What if my ancestors ne'er wore the crown, At least they have defended it for his: If in these veins there runs no royal blood, By saving Artaxerxes I've preserv'd The blood of Persia's kings. Let Xerxes speak His own, not boast the merits of his race. 'Tis chance, not virtue to be nobly born: Did choice direct our births, and only give Kingdoms to those who best could rule, perhaps Arbaces had been Xerxes, Xerxes then Had been Arbaces. Man. In Mandane's presence, With more respect, Arbaces, name her father. Arb. But when I suffer such injurious treatment, When I'm denied to indulge a blameless passion, 'Tis surely little, if I but complain. Man. Forgive me: from thy anger I begin To doubt thy truth: how shall I hope the heart That hates the father, can esteem the daughter? Arb. This hatred proves my passion more, Mandane; My indignation springs from love to thee; Because I fear, that, banish'd from thy sight, I ne'er may see thee more; that this perhaps Is the last timeâO Heaven, thou weep'st!âforbear, Dry up those tears, my love; too much I'm soften'd Without thy griefâI here would have thee cruelâ Permit me to depart; now imitate The sternness of thy father. [going. Man. Stay, and hear me; I have no heart to see thee leave me thus: Fain would I goâFarewell! Arb. Farewell, Mandane! Man. Be true to love, recall to mind Thou leav'st me here with woes opprest: And let sometimes Mandane find Remembrance in thy faithful breast. When thou art gone, though, midst my grief, These eyes no more thy image see: Yet love, to give my pains relief, Shall make my heart discourse with thee. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter Artaban behind, with his sword drawn and bloody. Arb. [to himself.] O hard command! O fatal separation! O cruel moment that must thus divide me From her for whom I breathe, while still I am left To drag this wretched life. Artab. [coming forward.] My sonâArbaces. Arb. My lord! Artab. Give me thy sword. Arb. 'Tis here, my lord. Artab. Thereâtake thou mine: fly; hide from every eye That crimson steel. Arb. O Gods! what hapless breast Pour'd forth this blood? Artab. Enquire not now, be gone; All shall be soon reveal'd. Arb. O sir! your looks, All pale and wild, have fill'd me with affright: I freeze with horror whilst I hear your lips Give painful utterance to your wordsâO speak! Tell me, what can this mean? Artab. Thou art reveng'd; Xerxes is dead, and by this hand. Arb. What say'st thou!â What do I hear?âWhat is it thou hast done? Artab. My dearest son, thy injuries were mineâ For thee I am guilty. Arb. Ha! for me you are guilty! There wanted only this to increase my woes. And what are now your hopes? Artab. My mind revolves A great design; thou may'st perhaps assume The reins of sovereigntyâdepartâmy purpose Demands that I remain. Arb. My soul's distracted In this dread interval! Artab. Still dost thou linger? Arb. O Heaven! Artab. Departâno moreâleave me in peace. Arb. What fatal day is this! undone Arbaces! A thousand woes my breast surprise; I pant in every part: Cold through my veins the current flies To guard my trembling heart. What anguish must this stroke of fate My dear Mandane cost! How shall my soul lament too late A father's virtue lost! [Exit. SCENE III. Artaban alone. Be resolute, my thoughts! the first bold step Demands a second: to withdraw the hand When enter'd upon crimes, were to be guilty Without the hopes to enjoy the fruits of treason. Drain then the royal blood its utmost drop, Nor let the empty name of virtue shake me. Whate'er we judge, even daring guilt sometimes May claim applause. To combat with ourselves; To bear unmov'd the pangs of self-remorse; Amidst surrounding objects of affright To keep the courage fix'd: these, these are virtues A glorious crime requiresâbut see, the prince: Now to my wilesâWhat mean these sudden cries! What tumult's this! SCENE IV. Enter Artaxerxes, Megabyzus and Guards. Artab. Already risen, sir! When scarce the day has dawn'd? What means this anger Which mingles with the grief, that clouds your brow? Artax. O dearest Artaban! most welcome to me: Give me thy counsel, give me aid, revenge; All, all I ask from thy fidelity. Artab. I tremble, Prince, at this confus'd command: Declare yourself more fully. Artax. O ye powers! My father on his bed there murder'd lies! Artab. Say, how! Artax. I know notâ'midst the shade and silence Of this unhappy night, some villain wrought The horrid deed. Artab. Insatiate lust of empire! What piety, what holy bond of nature Can curb thy impious, thy ungovern'd rage! Artax. I understand thee, friend; my faithless brother, Darius is the guilty. Artab. Who but he By night could penetrate the royal palace? Who else could find access to Xerxes' bed? His discontent, his turbulence of temper, His eagerness to grasp his father's sceptreâ Alas! my lord! I tremble for your life: For pity's sake take heedâfor oft one crime Is as a step that to another leads: Revenge your father, and preserve yourself. Artax. O! if there's one amongst you present here, Who feels compassion for a murder'd king; Who feels abhorrence of the crime, who calls Himself my friendânow let him fly, to punish The parricide, the traitor. Artab. Guards, to you, In Artaxerxes speaks a prince, a son; Or rather say in him your sovereign speaks: Obey his mandate, punish this offender, I'll lead you forth and teach you where to strike. Now Fortune favour my designs. [aside. Artax. Yet stay: Hear me; revenge like this may more offend My father than the crime: Is not Darius The son of Xerxes? Artab. O! 'twere impious now To counsel mercy: he whose hand could shed A parent's blood, has lost the name of son. On troubled Lethe's dreary coast, Hark! a king and father's ghost Calls for vengeance and repose! His looks now chill my soul with fear; And now his dreadful voice I hear: See! in his breast, reveal'd to view, That breast from whence your life you drew, His gaping wound he shows! [Exit with guards. SCENE V. Artaxerxes, Megabyzus. Artax. What victim must I slay! O Megabyzus! Mega. Remove your doubts: one stroke alone will punish An impious murderer and secure your reign. Artax. But to the world my justice may appear A thirst of empireâO this thought alone Will blot the peace of all my future days! Noânoâit must not be: let me be gone And call the sentence back. [going. Mega. My lord! what would you? Now is the time to avenge your private wrongs. Learn to be cruel from your cruel brother, He oft has taught it you. Artax. Yet ought not I To imitate his crimes: his frequent guilt Acquits not mine. Is there a fault on earth But what may plead example? None are guilty, If to produce example may suffice To wipe away the stain. Mega. But self-defence Is nature's law: unless you take his life By him you must be slain. Artax. O noâmy danger Shall find the favour of protecting Jove To save me from a brother's impious rage. [going. SCENE VI. Enter Semira. Sem. Prince, whither would you go? Artax. Farewell, Semira. Sem. You fly me, Artaxerxes; stay and hear me. Artax. Permit me to depart; detain me not. Sem. Is this the welcome that thou giv'st to her, Who sighs but for thy love? Artax. If I hear more, Too much, Semira, I offend my duty. Sem. Go then, ingrate! I plainly read thy scorn. Artax. Forbear, dear idol of my love! O! call me not ingrate: Enough, alas! I'm doom'd to prove The frowns of angry fate. Love knows my passions, void of art, Still on thy beauties dwell: This truth my ever constant heart, This truth thy own can tell. [Exit. SCENE VII. Semira, Megabyzus. Sem. My fears are great: ere break of day my brother Departed hence: I met my father arm'd, Who spoke not to me: Artaxerxes troubled, Accuses Heaven and leaves me. Megabyzus, What means all this? Thou know'stârelieve my doubts, And teach me what to fear. Mega. And know'st thou not, That now fraternal strife divides the court? Art thou to learn that Xerxes, in his sleep, Is murder'd by Darius? Sem. Heavenly powers! What do I hear! most wretched Persia! Mega. Cease, Cease vainly to afflict thyself, Semira: What part hast thou in quarrels of ambition, In these dissensions of the royal house? Perhaps you fear that Persia's realms may want A king to ruleâO we shall find too many To exact our servitude! Then let the brothers Rage on, and drench with rival blood the throne; Whoever conquers is to me the same. Sem. But in the general troubles of a state, Each bears a part; and in a faithful subject, Indifference is a crime. I know a son Has drench'd his weapon in a father's blood: I know that Artaxerxes is in danger; And would'st thou have me yet, a tame spectatress, Behold the fatal spectacle unmov'd, As on the tragic scene the mimic sufferings Of mad Orestes? Mega. I perceive the love Of Artaxerxes, in Semira speaks. But know that, either victor o'er his brother, The throne ascending, he'll forget Semira; Or, if subdued, his rival's policy Will hunt his life: thus, either way you lose him, A conqueror or vanquish'd. Would you deign To hear the dictates of a faithful breast, Select a lover like yourself in rank. Reflect that Love delights in equal state: And should you e'er vouchsafe to attend my counsel, Remember, fair one, then, who most adores you. Sem. Thy counsel, sure, is worthy of thyself; And to reward it, I'll return this other, Which better suits than thineâforbear to love me. Mega. Impossible to see and not to love thee! Sem. And who compels thee then to gaze upon me? Fly from my presence, and some other seek More grateful for thy love. Mega. My flight avails not: Your image still remains within my breast: My soul, even absent, dotes upon your beauties. Still views, and still adores them. Yes, Semira, When use becomes a nature, what we lose, Our fancy forms and sets in dreams before us. The warrior dreams of fighting bands; The huntsman dreams of sylvan lands: The fisher dreams his sports again, And spreads the net, or guides the cane. Whene'er in sleep I close my eyes, In sleep I see her form arise; Her form, for whom, alas! in vain All day I sigh, all day complain! [Exit. SCENE VIII. Semira alone. Almighty powers! Protecting Gods of Persia! Guard for this realm the life of Artaxerxes. Yet, ah! should he be victor o'er Darius, To me he's lost! this hand which, when a subject, He deign'd to ask, a sovereign he'll despise. But shall my tears be weigh'd against his life? Let him but reign, and I submit to lose him. O! I were impious to desire his death, Through fear he should forsake meâNo, ye Gods, I'll ne'er repent my prayer for Artaxerxes. Cruel fate! from love's excess To wish to lose what most I love! Sure never maid felt such distress: No breast can greater torments prove. Yet 'midst my griefs I shall be bless'd, If he I love but pitying says: Too much, Semira, thou'rt oppress'd; Whom love ungrateful thus repays. [Exit. SCENE IX. The palace. Mandane alone. Where shall I fly, or whither shall I turn! For pity's sake, who from this fatal palace Will lead my steps, or give me needful counsel? Unhappy names of sister, lover, daughter! In one distressful moment must I lose My brothers, father, loverâ SCENE X. Enter Artaxerxes. Artax. Ah! Mandane. Man. Say, Artaxerxes, does Darius live? Or hast thou yet begun to incur the guilt Of thy poor brother's death? Artax. Princess, I seek To save me from the crime: My zeal, O Heaven! Drew from my hasty lips the cruel order; Which scarcely given, my soul was seiz'd with horror: From place to place I run thro' all the palace, To stop the dire effects, and ask, in vain, Tidings of Artaban and of Darius. Man. See, Artaban is here. SCENE XI. Enter Artaban. Artab. My lord! Artax. My friend! Artab. I sought you, sir. Artax. And I've pursued thy steps. Artab. Perhaps you fearâ Artax. I fearâ Artab. Dismiss your fears: 'Tis finish'dâArtaxerxes is my king: Darius is chastis'd. Artax. Immortal powers! Man. Unhappy fate! Artab. The unwary parricide Himself expos'd his bosom to the stroke. Artax. O Gods! Artab. You sighâwe but obey'd the order Yourself had given. Artax. Thou should'st have better read My secret soul. Man. Thou might'st have well foreseen His horror, his repentance. Artax. In a son Who lost his father, O! thou should'st have pitied The first emotions of ungovern'd passion. Artab. Such pity had been vain. To obey the mandate So ready were thy guards, that ere I saw them Attack Darius, I beheld him slain. Artax. O villains! never shall they drench unpunish'd Their impious weapons in a prince's blood. Artab. But, sir! 'twas your command that made them bold, The fatal stroke was yours, and yours alone. Artax. 'Tis all too true!âI know and own my crime: Yes, Artaban, 'tis I indeed am guilty. Artab. Guilty! of what? Of acting noble justice, Of vengeance due to Xerxes? Be compos'd, And think that by an impious brother's death, A parricide is punish'd. SCENE XII. Enter Semira. Sem. Artaxerxes, Appease thy troubled thoughts. Artax. What means Semira, That thus she greets us with the looks of joy? Sem. Darius is not guilty of the crime Of Xerxes' death. Man. Ye powers! What do I hear! Artax. How know'st thou this? Sem. 'Tis certain that the assassin Even now was seiz'd; for lurking near the walls That compass round the gardens of the palace, Thy soldiers made him prisoner: every token Declar'd his guilt; the place, his flight, his looks Of terror, speech confus'd, his sword unsheath'd, Still reeking with the blood. Artax. But sayâhis name? Sem. Each one conceals it; when I ask'd, they hung Their heads in silence. Man. Should it prove Arbaces. [aside. Artab. My son is taken. [aside. Artax. What a wretch am I! Must Artaxerxes then ascend the throne, Stain'd with a murder'd brother's guiltless blood, Abhorr'd by Persia, hated by the world! Sem. Is then Darius dead? Artax. He's dead, Semira; The barbarous sentence issued from these lips; O! while I live I shall no more have peace: The cries of my remorse will sound for ever Within my tortur'd bosom: I shall view A father's and a brother's angry shade Distract my days, and terrify my dreams! In every place will vengeful furies rise, In dread remembrance of a brother's murder, And shake before my eyes the sable torch Kindled in Phlegethon's infernal stream. Man. Too mighty are thy sorrows, Artaxerxes; Since all must here acquit thee of a crime, In which thy heart, unconscious, ne'er concurr'd. Sem. Let your resentment find a nobler object, And with the assassin's death, before the world, Assert your justice. Artax. Where's the impious wretch? Conduct him to me. Artab. I myself will go To hasten his arrival hither. [going. Artax. Stay: O Artaban, Semira and Mandane! Let none in pity leave me; help me now: Yes,I would now have near me all my friends. Where, Artaban, where is my dear Arbaces? Is this the friendship that from early years To me he vow'd? Does he alone forsake me? Man. And know'st thou not he was forbid the palace, To punish him for too presumptuous love? Artax. Let him return; I here revoke the sentence. SCENE XIII. Enter Megabyzus, with Arbaces disarmed and guarded. Mega. Arbaces is the criminal. Artax. Ye powers! Mega. See in those looks the marks of conscious guilt. [pointing to Arb. Artax. My friend! Artab. My son! Sem. My brother! Man. My Arbaces! Artax. And does Arbaces thus return before me? And could thy soul conceive so black a crime? Arb. I am innocent. Man. O grant it, gracious Heaven! Artax. If thou art innocent, defend thyself; Remove our doubts, clear up each mark of guilt, And let thy innocence to all appear. Arb. I am not guiltyâthis is my defence. Artab. Grant he may still be silent! [aside. Man. Yet thy anger Against my fatherâ Arb. O! 'twas just. Artax. Thy flightâ Arb. 'Tis true, I fled. Man. Thy silenceâ Arb. Fate demands it. Artax. Thy looks confus'dâ Arb. They suit my present state. Man. Thy sword besmear'd with bloodâ Arb. 'Tis true; my hand That weapon bore. Artax. And yet thou art not guilty? Man. Thou didst not kill him? Arb. I am innocent. Artax. Arbaces, still appearances condemn thee. Arb. I own itâyet appearance is fallacious. Artax. Speaks not Semira? Sem. O! I am all confusion! Artax. Why speaks not Artaban? Artab. O Gods! I am lost In vainly seeking some pretence to save him. Artax. Relentless powers! what now remains for me! And must I punish in my dearest friend My most inveterate foe? Cruel Arbaces! Say, wherefore didst thou give me once such proofs Of faith and truth? Were then thy gentle manners, That outward semblance of a steady virtue, The specious covering of a guilty soul? Could I but blot that hour from my remembrance, What time you rais'd me, where oppress'd I fell Encompass'd round with foes, and bravely shed With generous zeal your blood to ransom mine; That while I now revenge a parent's death, I might not seem ungrateful to a friend. Arb. Let not the guiltless lose your former love, If ever I deserv'd, I still deserve it. Artab. Presumptuous! canst thou claim without a blush The affections of thy prince? Perfidious son! Thy father's shame, thy father's punishment. Arb. Art thou, my father, too conspir'd against me? Artab. What wouldst thou have from me? Shall I partake Thy guilt by parlying with thee? No, my lord, [to Artaxerxes. Prove, prove thy justice; I myself solicit His speedy sentence; plead not in his favour That Artaban's his fatherâO forget My loyal truth, forget the blood which oft In danger's field I lavish'd for my country, And mingle his with what I've shed before. Artax. O wondrous faith! Artab. Resolveâand if you still Retain some kindness for him, now forget it. Artax. I will resolveâbut hard must prove the trial! Ah! cease awhile, your counsel cease; One moment let me breathe in peace: In vain my reason would resolve; In vain, alas! I now revolve The thoughts that in my bosom spring: This way and that my heart they rend; At once I'm lover, judge, and friend, And criminal, and king! [Exit. SCENE XIV. Mandane, Semira, Artaban, Arbaces, Megabyzus, Guards. Arb. Wretched Arbaces! must thou then endure, Though innocent, the bitter sting of insult? Mega. What strange event is this? Sem. Alas! I fear More evils yet. [aside. Man. My peace is lost for ever! [aside. Artab. I tremble while I feign. [aside. Arb. Alas! my father, Thou dost not look upon meâI could bear, Without repining, all accusers else; But O! that thou should'st rise against Arbaces, That he, who gave me life, should seek my death, The thought, with horror, chills me: sure a father May feel some pity for his suffering son. Artab. Thou art no more my son, no more This heart a kindred feeling knows; The heart thou vainly dost implore, No pity to a traitor owes. 'Tis guilt that makes thee thus distrest, And fills with woe thy parent's breast. [Exit. SCENE XV. Mandane, Semira, Arbaces, Megabyzus, Guards. Arb. By what offence of mine, too cruel powers! Have I incurr'd your wrath? Yet let Semira At least vouchsafe to hear and pity me. Sem. Let but thy innocence appear, Thy words with transport shall I hear, And all Semira's soul is thine: But while thou bear'st a traitor's name, Thou must not even my pity claim; In thy defence I dare not join. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Mandane, Arbaces, Megabyzus, Guards. Arb. And is there none will take this wretched life? Ah! Megabyzus, if thy pity everâ Mega. Speak not to me. Arb. Ah! Princess! Man. Hence, and leave me. Arb. Hear me, my friend. Mega. I shall not hear a traitor. [Exit. SCENE XVII. Mandane, Arbaces, Guards. Arb. At least, Mandane, listen for a moment. Man. Think not I'll listen to a traitor's voice. Arb. My life, my soul! Man. And dar'st thou, wretch, presume To call me thus? To offer me that hand Which slew my father! Arb. O! I slew him not. Man. Who was the assassin? Speak. Arb. Alas! I cannot: My lipsâ Man. Thy lips are false. Arb. My heartâ Man. Thy heart Is true to vice, because it feels not horror For such a crime committed. Arb. I am stillâ Man. Thou art a traitor. Arb. I am innocent. Man. Ha! innocent! Arb. I swear it. Man. Faithless wretch! Arb. What pangs I suffer for a cruel father! [aside. Didst thou but know, my life!â Man. Too well I know Thy hate of Xerxes. Arb. Still thou canst not tellâ Man. I heard thy threats. Arb. And yet thou art deceiv'd. Man. O yes, perfidious! I was then deceiv'd, And then alone, when I believ'd and lov'd thee. Arb. Then nowâ Man. I hate theeâ Arb. And thou artâ Man. Thy foe. Arb. Thou seek'stâ Man. I seek thy death. Arb. Thy first affectionâ Man. 'Tis all to hatred chang'd. Arb. And wilt thou not Believe Arbaces? Man. No, thou art falsehood all. Tell me that thy treacherous nature, Ever purpos'd to deceive; Tell me that thy heart's a traitor, Perjur'd monster! I'll believe. Fain, ye Gods! I would forget him, [aside. Fain would drive him from my thought, Yet, alas! I cannot hate him, As my duty says I ought. [Exit. SCENE XVIII. Arbaces, Guards. Arb. NoâFortune has no further ills in store; In one unhappy day I have found them all. My friend is lost, my sister turn'd against me; My father has accus'd his son; my lov'd Mandane Mandane weeps; and yet I dare not speak; I must be silent still. Where is the wretch Like me distress'd! Ye righteous Gods! have pity: If thus your wrath continues to pursue me, 'Tis more than human weakness can sustain. Forlorn I plough the stormy wave, Without the help of shrouds or sails: The skies grow black, the billows rave, The winds arise, the steerage fails. Of all forsaken, in despair, I blindly drive as Fortune guides; While innocence, which still I bear, But whelms my bark beneath the tides! [Exit guarded. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A royal apartment. Artaxerxes, Artaban. Artax. Guards, from the prison lead Arbaces hither. [speaking as he enters. Thou hast thy full request, and would to Heaven This meeting might preserve him! Artab. Think not, sir, That what I ask springs from paternal fondness, Or ill-tim'd hopes to find him innocent; His guilt is too apparent; he must die. Your safety only urges me to see him; As yet the motive of his crime is secret, The accomplices unknown: I would explore Each dark device of treason. Artax. Artaban, How does thy fortitude excite my envy! I tremble at the danger of a friend; Thou keep'st thy temper while thy son's condemn'd. Artab. How dearly does it cost my heart to assume These looks of firmness, when my bosom owns The voice of struggling nature! I too feel The tender weakness common to a parent: But midst the conflict duty still prevails: No longer he's my son, whose impious crime Has fill'd his father's aged cheeks with shame: I was a subject, ere I was a parent. Artax. Thy virtue, friend, speaks strongly for Arbaces: I owe thee more the less thou plead'st his cause. Shall I be thus ungrateful to thy worth, Without remorse in him to punish thee? No, Artaban, let us contrive to save him: Find some pretence that I may doubt his crime; Let me entreat thee join thy cares with mine. Artab. What can I do when every thing condemns him? You see, Arbaces, conscious of his guilt, Makes no defence. Artax. But yet those lips that ne'er Were wont to lie, declared his innocence. Can nature change at once? Ah, no! perhaps Some cause, to us unknown, compels his silence. Speak to him, Artaban; he to a father May open all he from his judge conceals. I will retire apart, that thou with freedom May'st urge the converse with him; watch him nearly, Examine all his thoughts; find, if thou canst, Some shadow of defence; preserve thy son, Thy sovereign's peace, the honour of his throne; Deceive me, if thou wilt, and I'll forgive thee. Give me my dearest friend once more, My friend in life approv'd; His virtue once again restore, That virtue which I lov'd. Companions from our infant state, Thou know'st in every change of fate, We kept the friendly chain: With him I parted every care, With him did every pleasure share, And soften'd every pain. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter Arbaces guarded. Artab. Now rides my vessel nigh the portâArbaces, Approach; and you retire, but near at hand Await my call. [the guards retire. Arb. My father here alone? Artab. At length, my son, I may preserve thy life. From thoughtless Artaxerxes I've obtain'd To speak with thee in privateâlet us go: I can conduct thee by a secret way, To him unknown; and thus at once deceive His guards and him. Arb. Dost thou propose a flight That would confirm my guilt? Artab. Unthinking boy! Let us be goneâI give thee liberty; I save thee from the king's resentment, lead thee To popular applauseâperchance to reign. Arb. What say you, sir!âto reign! Artab. Thou know'st the race Of Xerxes has to all been hateful long: I need but show thee to the impatient troops; Already to our party have I gain'd The leaders of the bands. Arb. Shall I become A rebel to my prince? The thought alone Fills me with horror: O my father! leave, Leave me my innocence. Artab. 'Tis lost already, Since all believe it lost: thou art a prisoner, And bear'st each mark of guilt. Arb. But yet unjustly. Artab. No matter; this avails not: innocence Consists, Arbaces, in the fond belief Of others; take but that belief away, It shrinks to nothing: he alone is virtuous Who wears the best disguise, and artful hides His inmost passions from the observing world. Arb. O sir! you are deceiv'd; the noble mind Is to itself a world; approves or censures In secret all its good or evil deeds, Above the partial breath of vulgar crowds. Artab. Let it be soâbut must we to preserve Our innocence, be prodigal of life? Arb. And what is life, my father? Artab. Life, my son, Is Heaven's most valued gift. Arb. Life is a good That lessens while we use it, every moment Of our enjoyment is but as a step That leads us nearer to our dissolution; And from the cradle we begin to die. Artab. And shall I then contend with thee to save thee? No further reason seekâ'tis my command; Dispatch. Arb. Forgive me, but in this I must Transgress your first command. Artab. Force shall compel you; Follow me. [offers to take him by the hand. Arb. Leave me yet in peace, my father: Put not my duty to so hard a trial; For should you now constrain meâ Artab. Dost thou threaten? Ungrateful boy!âSpeak outâwhat would'st thou do? Arb. Rather than follow you I'd hazard all. Artab. Soon shall we see who conquers: follow me: Away. [takes his hand. Arb. Ho! guards! Artab. Be silent. Arb. Guards! come forth; Give me again my chains: back to my dungeon Once more conduct me. [guards return. Artab. O! I burn with rage! [aside. Arb. Bid me farewell, my father. Artab. Hence, and leave me; Think not I'll listen to a wretch like thee. Arb. When such resentment fills thy mind, Such anger arms thy brow severe; How can I hope my peace to find, Or comfort from thy lips to hear? Inhuman rigour, thus to drive A father's pity from your breast; And of a parent's love deprive A son as guiltless as distrest! [Exit guarded. SCENE III. Artaban alone. Now, Artaban, subdue thy weak affections, And to his fate resign a rebel-son. And yet I cannot from my heart condemn him; Methinks I love him more for differing from me; At once I am fill'd with rage and admiration; Pity and wrath by turns divide my soul. SCENE IV. Enter Megabyzus. Mega. O sir! on what are now your thoughts employ'd? Why are you thus irresoluteâremember 'Tis not a time to ponder, but to act: The peers in council meet; together join'd Are all the victims of your just resentment. There shall we find your rivals; these destroy'd, The path is smooth'd to empire. Let us fly To set Arbaces free. Artab. Ah! Megabyzus, What wretchedness is mine! my son refuses Empire and liberty; heeds not his life, And with himself involves us all in ruin. Mega. What says my lord? Artab. Even now contending with him, I strove in vain to conquer his resolves. Mega. Then from the prison let us bear him off By force. Artab. The time we lose to overcome His guard's fidelity, or shake their valour, Affords the king full leisure for defence. Mega. 'Tis true: then first let Artaxerxes die, And after save Arbaces. Artab. But the life Of my dear son remains a hostage for me. Mega. Behold this remedy: let us divide Our trusty friends between us; at one instant Do you attack the prison, I the palace. Artab. Our forces thus divided will be weaken'd. Mega. Something must be resolv'd. Artab. The safest course Is to resolve on nothing: we must now Have time to plan anew our baffled schemes. Mega. What if meanwhile Arbaces be condemn'd? Artab. Extremity of need will teach us then The speediest remedy: let it suffice, That thou continuest to dissemble yet, And keep thy followers steady to our cause. Meantime with caution every means I'll try That may seduce the guards: till now I thought The attempt was needless, therefore deem'd it folly, Without necessity, to increase our dangers. Mega. Dispose of me as to thyself seems fit. Artab. Betray me not, my friend. Mega. Who, I betray you? Ah, sir! What have you said? Can you believe I'll e'er be thus ungrateful? I remember My low beginning: to your bounteous hand I owe my all: you from the ignoble vulgar Have rais'd me to the foremost ranks of honour. Ah, sir! what have you said? Shall I betray you? Artab. What hitherto I've done for thee is little: If Fortune smiles upon me, Megabyzus, Thou shalt perceive my love: full well I know Thy passion for Semira, nor condemn it. I have resolv'dâbehold she comesâmy will Shall make thy love secure, and join us both By closer ties. Mega. O transport! SCENE V. Enter Semira. Artab. Come, my daughter; Behold thy husband. Sem. [aside.] Heavens! What do I hear? Is this a time, my lord, to think of nuptials, When my unhappy brother nowâ Artab. No more; Thy marriage here may stand him much in stead. Sem. Great is the sacrificeâAh! yet, my father, Reflect again; I amâ Artab. Thou art lost to sense, If thou refusest my commandâsee there Thy husband; 'tis my will; reply no further. Then learn to love, and should he seem Ungracious in your eyes; In him a father's choice esteem; Respect it and be wise. Less slow perhaps your heart will prove To catch the gentle fire, When midst the temple, kindling love, Shall Hymen's flames aspire. [Exit. SCENE VI. Semira, Megabyzus. Sem. Now hear me, Megabyzus; I begin At length to hope indulgence from your love. May I expect you'll grant me one request? Mega. What would I not to obey you? Sem. Yet I fear Thou wilt oppose my wish. Mega. Remove that fear By speaking your command. Sem. O! if thou lov'st me Break off these nuptials. Mega. I? Sem. Yes, Megabyzus, So may'st thou save me from my father's anger. Mega. I would obey you: but Semira surely Means but to jestâ Sem. O no! I speak my soul. Mega. It cannot beâyou mean to give me torment, I read your purpose. Sem. Dost thou then deride me? Till now I thought thee a more generous lover. Mega. And I till now believ'd Semira wiser. Sem. Thus dost thou shew the greatness of thy mind? Mega. Is this the favour you would ask a lover? Sem. I have open'd thee a field, where thou with praise, Without offending me, may'st prove thy virtue. Mega. My virtue would I prove, but not in this. Sem. Then must I hope in vain? Mega. Thy hope is vain. Sem. These tears I shedâ Mega. Avail not. Sem. These entreatiesâ Mega. Are scatter'd to the wind. Sem. Hear then, inhuman! I will obey my father; but expect not That ever I can love thee: I shall still Detest the fatal tie that binds me to thee. I swear thou shalt be hateful to my eyes: Thou may'st possess my hand, but ne'er my heart. Mega. I ask it not, Semira: 'tis enough That Megabyzus knows thee for his bride: If hating me will satiate thy revenge, Pursue thy hatred, I shall ne'er complain. Fear not I shall e'er repine, Call thee faithless or ingrate; Hate me still, but still be mine, Happy shall I deem my fate. The irksome folly I despise, Of the lover fond and vain; That would, in oppressive ties, Liberty of thought restrain. [Exit. SCENE VII. Enter Mandane. Sem. How many evils has one day united For my unhappiness!âHear me, Mandane! Man. Delay me not, Semira. Sem. Whither go'st thou With such impatience? Man. To the royal council. Sem. Conduct me with thee, if my power can ought Avail Arbaces. Man. Different are our views; Thou seek'st to save him, I pursue his life. Sem. Can thus the lover of Arbaces speak? Man. Thus Xerxes' daughter speaks. Sem. Alas! my brother Has sure no guilt, or for thy sake is guilty, Because too much he lov'd thee. Man. This, Semira, This is his greatest crime: his death alone Must clear my honour, must avenge the insult My virtue feels, to think the love I gave him That should have rouz'd his soul to generous deeds, Has, to my shame, now mark'd him for a traitor. Sem. Cannot the rigour of the threatening laws Suffice, without thy help, to punish him? Man. No, it suffices not: in Artaxerxes I fear th' emotions of a tender friendship; And in the nobles of the land I fear The force of blind affection; in himself I fear that unknown power, that friendly star Which conquers all, and makes each heart his own. Sem. Go then, inhuman! urge the fatal stroke, Accuse him, see him dieâbut yet reflectâ First weigh thy constancy, thou must forget Thy hopes, affections, and thy plighted faith; Thy tenderness; the mutual sighs exchang'd, The first fond looks; obliterate from thy mind The dear remembrance of that well-known face, From which thy heart first learn'd the sighs of love. Man. Unkind Semira, how have I deserv'd That you should thus awaken in my soul The pity that rebels against my duty, Which till this hour my virtue had suppress'd? Why will you call again ideas forth That bid my firmest courage sink before them, And in my breast renew the war of thoughts? If e'er I hop'd to triumph o'er The tyrant Love's too cruel power, O! let me still myself deceive; O! let me fondly still believe My heart has burst its chain. But, since, alas! to thee 'tis known, That hatred is my duty grown, Why wilt thou force me now to own, That while I strive, I strive in vain? [Exit. SCENE VIII. Semira alone. For which of all the numerous trials round me Shall I first arm my constancy? Mandane, Arbaces, Megabyzus, Artaxerxes, My father, all are now my foes; and each Assails my bosom in some tender part. While one I seek to oppose, I leave myself Defenceless to the rest, and find my strength Too weak alone to bear the shock of all. So when some flood, with mighty roar, Attempts above its bed to rise, To stop its rage, from shore to shore In haste the affrighted labourer flies. Vain are his toils; while here his care The torrent's rapid course restrains; Burst through a hundred channels there, It foams victorious o'er the plains. [Exit. SCENE IX. A great council hall with a throne on one side, seats on the other for the Grandees of the kingdom. A table and chair on the right hand of the throne. Artaxerxes preceded by a part of the guards, and by the Grandees of the kingdom, followed by the rest of the guards. Megabyzus. Artax. Behold, ye guardians of our Persian realm, Behold me ready to embrace the cares Of my paternal seat; but so unhappy, So full of turbulence begins my reign, This hand, yet unexperienc'd, dreads to grasp The sceptre of dominion: you, whose breasts Are fill'd with faith, experience, zeal and valour, Which oft you've shown to recompense the love My god-like father gave you, now assist me, And guide my steps to tread the paths of empire. Mega. My gracious king, Mandane and Semira Impatient ask admittance to your presence. Artax. Ye powers!âLet them approach; full well I know What different cause incites them. SCENE X. Enter Mandane and Semira. Sem. Artaxerxes, Have pity. Man. Vengeance, vengeance, Artaxerxes: I come to urge the death of one that's guilty. Sem. I ask the life of one that's innocent. Man. The treason's certain. Sem. Doubtful is the traitor. Man. But all appearances condemn Arbaces. Sem. Justice and reason must absolve Arbaces. Man. The father's blood, shed from his veins, requires The murderer's punishment. Sem. The son's preserv'd, Demands a recompense for its preserver. Man. Remember rigour is the throne's support. Sem. Reflect that mercy is its strongest basis. Man. O let the sorrows of a wretched daughter Excite your indignation! Sem. Let the tears Of an afflicted sister calm your anger. Man. All whom you here behold, except Semira, Require this sacrifice. Sem. Hear, Artaxerxes, Have pity! Man. Vengeance, vengeance! Artax. RiseâO Heaven!â Rise both: how are your pains excell'd by mine! Semira fears the rigour of my justice, Mandane fears my mercy. Artaxerxes, At once a friend and son, feels both your pangs, And trembles with Mandane and Semira. Ah! come my Artaban; speak comfort to me: [seeing Artaban. Hast thou found aught that may defend Arbaces? Say, has he prov'd his innocence? SCENE XI. Enter Artaban. Artab. In vain Is all our proffer'd pity: for his safety He heeds it not, or now despairs to find it. Artax. Ingrate! and will he force me to condemn him? Sem. Condemn him!âToo inhuman Artaxerxes! Shall then Semira's brother, Persia's glory, The friend of Artaxerxes, his defender, Bend to the fatal ignominious axe? Wretched Arbaces! All my tears are vain! O unregarded grief! Artax. Falsely, Semira, Thou say'st that I'm inhumanâcan I more? Thou see'st Arbaces offers no defence: What would'st thou do, or what would Artaban? Guards, let Arbaces be conducted to me: The father's self shall judge his son, shall hear, And, if he can, acquit him; to his hand I trust, in this, my right of sovereign power. Artab. What have you said? Man. Shall friendship thus prevail Above your duty? Sure you never sought His punishment, since to a father's voice You thus commit the sentence of the guilty. Artax. Yes, I commit the sentence to a father, Whose truth is known, who has himself accus'd A son whom now I vainly would defend; A father, who has greater cause than I To enforce his doom. Man. Yet is he still a father. Artax. Thence has he double cause to punish him: I on Arbaces only would revenge The death of Xerxes slain; but Artaban Must on his son revenge, with greater rigour, The death of Xerxes, and his own dishonour. Man. Then thusâ Artax. Should then Arbaces' guilt be prov'd, I thus secure a victim for the king, Without ingratitude to my preserver. Artab. Such trial, sirâ Artax. Is worthy of thy virtue. Artab. How will the world approve your choice? Artax. Can aught Be urg'd against it? Speak, ye peers, declare, [to the Grandees. Is there a doubt that prompts you to dissent? Mega. Each, by his silence, seems to approve the choice. Sem. See where my brother comes. Man. Ah me! [aside. Artax. No more: Let him be heard. [Artaxerxes ascends the throne, and the Grandees take their places.] Artab. Now, now my soul, conceal Thy inward pangs. [aside.] [takes his seat at the table. Man. Be still my beating heart! [aside. SCENE XII. Enter Arbaces in chains, guarded. Arb. Am I to Persia then become so hateful, That all are gather'd to behold my sufferings? My kingâ Artax. Call me thy friend: fain would I still Continue thus, that I might doubt thy guilt. And since the indulgent name of friend but ill Beseems the judge, the trial of thy crime To Artaban's committed. Arb. To my father! Artax. To him. Arb. I freeze with horror! [aside. Artab. Wherefore art thou Thus lost in thought? Perhaps thou stand'st amaz'd To see my fortitude. Arb. Alas! my father; I'm struck with horror to behold thee here, Reflecting what I am, and what thou art. Canst thou then judge me? Canst thou thus preserve Thy looks unchang'd, nor feel thy breast within Torn by conflicting pangs? Artab. Whate'er I feel, 'Tis not for thee to explore my secret thoughts, Or search how far my heart and face agree. Remember thou hast made me what I am: Had'st thou observ'd my counsels, had'st thou learn'd To tread the steps of an indulgent father, Before these peers I had not been the judge, Nor thou the criminal. Artax. Unhappy father! Man. We come not here to attend your private griefs: Or let Arbaces now defend himself, Or let him be condemn'd. Arb. Inhuman princess! [aside. Artab. Then let the criminal appear before me, And answer my demands. Thou art here, Arbaces, As Xerxes' murderer; and these the proofs That speak thy guilt: thy rash presumptuous love, Thy wrath against the kingâ Arb. My bloody weapon, The time, the place, my fear, my flight, I know All these proclaim me guilty; yet all these Are other than they seemâI am innocent. Artab. Produce the proofs; clear up thy sullied fame, And calm the anger of distress'd Mandane. Arb. Oh! would'st thou have me constant in my sufferings, Assail me not in that most tender part. At that lov'd nameâInhuman fatherâ Artab. Hold, With passion blind, thou know'st not where thou art, With whom thou speak'st, or what assembly hears thee. Arb. But yet my fatherâ Artab. Yet my soul conceal Thy inward pangs. [aside. Man. Be still my beating heart. [aside. Artab. Thy crime demands repentance or defence. Artax. O speakâassist our pitying grace. Arb. My king! I cannot speak of guilt or of defence; Nor can I find a motive to repent; And should you question me a thousand times, I must a thousand times repeat the same. Artab. O filial love! [aside. Man. Yes, yes, his speech, his silence Alike declare him guilty: wherefore then This long delay? What means the judge? Is this The man that should revenge his murder'd king, And clear his own dishonour? Arb. Dost thou seek My death, Mandane? Man. Persevere, my soul. [aside. Artab. Princess, thy just reproach has rouz'd my virtue: Let Artaban pronounce the impartial sentence, And give to Persia's realms a great example Of loyalty and justice yet unknown. I here condemn my sonâArbaces die. [signs the paper. Man. O Heaven! [aside. Artax. Defer, my friend, the fatal sentence. Artab. The deed is sign'dâI have fulfill'd my duty. [rises and gives the paper to Megabyzus. Artax. O barbarous triumph! [descends from his throne, the Grandees rise. Sem. Most inhuman father! Man. My tears betray me. [aside. Arb. Does Mandane weep? Can then my fate at length excite your pity? Man. Tears flow not less from pleasure than from grief. Artab. The rigorous judge has done his partâO sir! Permit the father now to be indulg'd. Forgive, my son, the laws of tyrant duty, Endure with patience what remains to suffer: [to Arb. Let not the thought of punishment affright thee; The fear of evil is the greatest evil. Arb. Alas! my constancy begins to shake, To view myself before the world expos'd A seeming criminal; to see my hopes Thus blasted in their spring; my day of life Extinct at early dawn; to find myself Hateful to Persia, to my friend, my love; To know my fatherâmost unnatural father! But whither am I hurried?âO farewell! [going, he stops. Artab. My soul is chill'd. [aside. Man. I faint. [aside. Arb. Too rash Arbaces, What hast thou utter'd? Pardon me, my father; Behold me at your feet: excuse the transports Of wild despair: let all my blood be shed, I'll ne'er complain, nor call the sentence cruel, But kiss the hand that signs my death. Artab. O rise! Thou hast indeed too deep a cause for anguish. But knowâO Heaven!âThis last embrace and leave me. Arb. While on this dear embrace I dwell, O hear me by this last farewell! Preserve thyself from ill, remove This cruel scorn from her I love; And still my king defend. I meet my doom without regret, If all the woes that Persia threat On me alone descend. [Exit guarded, followed by Megabyzus, The Grandees go out.] SCENE XIII. Ataxerxes, Artaban, Mandane, Semira. Man. Arbaces gone, I now indeed begin To feel the stroke of death. Artab. Behold, Mandane, To appease thy rage I shed my dearest blood. Man. Ah! wretch! fly from my presence, from the light Of Heaven, the golden stars: hide thee, inhuman, Deep in the hollow earth's most dark recess, If earth herself will in her entrails yield A shelter for a cruel impious father, Lost to affection, and to nature lost! Artab. And is my virtue thenâ Man. Barbarian! peace: What virtue dost thou boast? Virtue has still Its bounds prescrib'd; extending to excess, It grows a vice. Artab. But art not thou the same That urg'd my tardy justice? Man. Yes, I am; And glory in my rigourâLet Arbaces Be judg'd again, again I'll urge his sentence. Mandane's duty was to avenge a father, But Artaban's to save a son: compassion Became thy state, and hatred suited mine. I was forbid to listen to the call Of tender love, but thou should'st have forgot The rigorous judge: such were our different duties. Hence to Hircania's woods confin'd, Whose gloom a thousand monsters hides; There none amid the savage kind, So cruel as thyself resides. Whate'er of evil Afric forms, Whose sands are parch'd with burning heat; Whate'er is seen in raging storms, All, all, in thee collected meet. [Exit. SCENE XIV. Artaxerxes, Artaban, Semira. Artax. O my Semira! how has Heaven conspir'd To ruin poor Arbaces! Sem. Barbarous tyrant! And art thou chang'd so soon? First would'st thou kill Thy friend, and then lament him? Artax. To his father I gave the power to acquit or to condemn him. And am I then a tyrant? Have I kill'd him? Sem. O! 'tis the most ingenious cruelty! The father judging, was compell'd to act Subservient to the laws; to thee, a king, The laws were subject: pity had in him Been criminal, but was from thee a duty. No, rather tell me that with savage joy, Thou see'st a son slain by his father's doom; That friendship and that love are thine no more. Artax. Let Persia witness for me, that I now Am grateful to Arbaces, that I feel Compassion for my friend, and love for thee. Sem. Yes, till this hour, I with the world deceiv'd, Admir'd thy seeming virtue, and believ'd thee A tender lover, and a generous friend: But now, one moment shews thee, as thou art; A treacherous friend, and an inhuman lover. When love with unresisted chains The natives of the woods constrains, The Armenian tigress drops her rage, The lion learns his wrath to assuage. But thou with wrath more fell indu'd, Than every savage of the wood, Canst bid thy heart relentless prove To every tender call of love. [Exit. SCENE XV. Artaxerxes, Artaban. Artax. Didst thou not hear unkind Semira's rage? Artab. Didst thou not hear unjust Mandane's anger? Artax. I am all compassion, yet she calls me tyrant. Artab. I am only just, and yet she calls me cruel. Artax. And does my mercy meet with this reward? Artab. Is this the recompense of rigid virtue? Artax. O Artaban! in one distressful day, What loss have I sustain'd! Artab. Forbear to murmur; Leave, leave complaints to me, for I this day Of all mankind am surely most unhappy. Artax. Great are thy pains indeed, nor little mine. Alas! I know not of the two, To which compassion most is due, The friend or father's state: But this I to my grief must own, That love in me was choice alone, In thee decreed by fate. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Artaban alone. At length I am alone, and once again Can breathe at liberty. To hear myself Declar'd Arbaces' judge, had nearly lost me. But let me think no more on perils past, Myself I've sav'd, now let me save my son. So when the sudden lightning flies, The shepherd, struck with pale surprise, Falls senseless to the ground: But when he finds his fears were vain, Again he rises, breathes again; And careful numbers on the plain His frighted flock dispers'd around. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. An inner part of the citadel where Arbaces is confined. A view of several prisons. A little door on the right hand that leads up to the palace. Arbaces alone. Ah! why should death so slowly move, When death is but the end of woe? To those who happy fortune prove, Death only can be deem'd a foe. SCENE II. Enter Artaxerxes. Artax. Arbaces. Arb. O ye powers! Whom do I see! What brings you to these seats of grief and horror? Artax. Pity and friendship. Arb. Wherefore come you, sir, To share my wretchedness? Artax. I come to save thee. Arb. To save me! Artax. Linger notâbut where yon' way Leads to a lonely quarter of the palace, Direct thy hasty steps: fly, swiftly fly, Far, far remote, and seek some safer realm: Remember Artaxerxes, love him still, And live. Arb. My king, if you believe me guilty, Why would you save me? and if innocent, Then wherefore should I fly? Artax. If thou art guilty I give thee back the life thou gav'st to me; If thou art innocent, I offer now The only means by which thou canst escape, While thou continuest silentâSpare thy friend The grief of killing thee; appease the tumults Of this distracted bosom: whether friendship Has o'er my senses cast her partial veil, Or that some God protects the innocent, I have no peace till thou art safe: methinks I hear a secret voice that bids me weigh Thy merit and thy fault in equal scales; And now reminds me that the crime is doubtful, But certain is the virtue that preserv'd me. Arb. Permit me, sir, to die; before the world I stand condemn'd; your dignity compels you To see me punish'd; I shall die contented To think that once I sav'd my friend his life, And dying now preserve my sovereign's honour. Artax. Such sentiments ne'er came from guilty lips: Belov'd Arbaces, let us not delay: Enough that for my honour it be rumour'd Thou wert in private punish'd, that I fear'd To stain the pomp of this important day, When Asia first beholds me on the throne. Arb. At length your mercy may be knownâand thenâ Artax. Arbaces, hence; I beg thee to depart; And if th' entreaties of thy friend avail not, Thy king commands it. Arb. Yes, I will obey, Some future time Arbaces may be grateful: Meanwhile Heaven hear my vows for Artaxerxes: May every year of his auspicious reign Be mark'd with triumphs: may the subject world Bring palms and laurels for his conquering arms: Slow may the ParcÃ¦ wind his thread of life; And may that peace be his which I have lost; Which never more this bosom must regain, Till to my friend and country I return! The stream, divided from the main, Bathes the mountain, bathes the plain; In some crystal river goes, Or confin'd in fountains flows: Still with sighs it seems to mourn, Gently murmuring to return To the sea from which it rose; From which was drawn its limpid store, Where, its many wanderings o'er, Again it hopes to find repose. [Exit. SCENE III. Artaxerxes alone. Those looks erect, that open mien of virtue Can never speak the traitor: no disguise Can hide the lustre of a noble mind; And in the features still we read the heart. Light vapours that ascending play, And spread with fleecy clouds the day, May thinly veil, But not conceal The sun's refulgent ray. In vain the shallow riv'let flows The sandy bed to hide; The clear transparent crystal shows Each weed beneath the tide. [Exit. SCENE IV. Artaban followed by the conspirators, Megabyzus. Artab. My son, Arbaces! Whither art thou gone? He surely hears my voiceâArbacesâHeavens! Where lurks he? While I seek my son, my friends, The care be yours to keep this pass secure. [enters betwixt the scenes, on the right hand. Mega. And wherefore do we loiter still? [to the conspirators. The time Now calls us forthâBut where is Artaban? Where is Arbaces? Wherefore this inaction? In such an enterprize is this a season For cold neglect?âWhat ho! Lord Artaban. [enters betwixt the scenes, on the left hand. Artab. Unhappy me! [coming out a different way. My son, my son is lost! A deadly coldness freezes at my heart: I fear, I doubtâyet there perhaps conceal'd, I yet may findâHa! Megabyzus here! [meets Megabyzus. Mega. What Artaban! Artab. Say, hast thou found my son? Mega. Hast thou not seen him then? Artab. O Heaven! my doubts Still more and more increase. Mega. Explain yourself; What has befallen Arbaces? Artab. Who, alas! Can now inform me of him? I'm distracted Amidst a thousand cares and dread suspicions. How many fatal images has fear Rais'd in my tortur'd breast! Who knows his fate! Who knows if yet he lives? Mega. Too soon you drive Suspicions to extremes; may not Mandane Or Artaxerxes, urg'd by love or friendship, Have set the prisoner free? Behold the way That to the palace leads. Artab. But wherefore yet From me conceal his flight? Ah! Megabyzus, Arbaces is no more; I know it well, And each in pity hides it from his father. Mega. Avert the omen, Heaven! Yet recollect Your troubled thoughts; resume your wonted firmness; Our enterprize demands it all. Artab. Alas! What enterprize can now engross my mind? I have no enterprizeâmy son is lost! Mega. What says my lord? And have you then in vain Seduc'd the royal guards? Have I in vain Seduc'd the allegiance of the troops?âResolve: This moment Artaxerxes goes to swear Observance to the laws: the sacred cup By your command already have I ting'd With deadly juice: and shall we now so poorly Lose all our cares and toils? Artab. For whom, my friend, Should I still toil, unless I find Arbaces? My son was all my joy; to make him great I first became a traitor; for his sake Was odious to myself; depriv'd of him, What further hope remains? I lose the fruit Of all my crimes. Mega. Arbaces, dead or living, Claims at your hands the empire, or revenge. Artab. For that alone I liveâYes, Megabyzus, Lead, lead me where thou wilt; I trust in thee. Mega. Trust that I lead thee on to victory. O! let the splendor of a crown To fearless deeds thy soul inspire: O! let the danger of a son With generous rage thy bosom fire. The heart that brave revenge pursues, Can every feeble thought control: And sweet 'tis then the calm to lose Amidst the tempest of the soul. [Exit. SCENE V. Artaban alone. Relentless Gods! you now have found the way, The only way to unman me: but to doubt If yet my dear Arbaces lives distracts me; I cannot overcome this secret tumult, That from my reason takes the power to govern. If thou, my son, to life art lost, No more I'll breathe the vital air; But first, dispatch'd to Pluto's coast, A monarch shall my message bear. Beside the sable stream his oar The infernal pilot must suspend, Till to the margin of the shore The mournful father shall descend. [Exit. SCENE VI. An apartment belonging to Mandane. Mandane alone. Whether too frequent sorrow dulls the sense Or that our souls partake some inward light That glances at futurity, I know not: I cannot mourn Arbaces as I ought: Yet surely still he lives, for were he dead, The tidings must have reach'd me; fame is ever Industrious to disperse the news of woe. SCENE VII. Enter Semira. Sem. At length thou may'st be comforted, Mandane, For Heaven now smiles upon thee. Man. Has the king Releas'd Arbaces? Sem. Rather say the king Has slain Arbaces. Man. Ha! What dost thou mean? Sem. 'Tis plain to all; in secret has he fallen A cruel sacrifice. Man. Fallacious hopes! O fatal day! Sem. Behold thou art reveng'd, Thy rage is sated: would'st thou more? Or seek'st thou Some other victim? Speak. Man. Alas! Semira, Light evils speak, but mighty griefs are silent. Sem. What heart was e'er more cruel found than thine! There's not an eye unmoisten'd at his death, Yet thou canst hear his fate without a tear. Man. That grief is little which permits our tears. Sem. Go, if thou art not yet appeas'd, and glut With my dear brother's corse thy greedy sight: Observe his bosom, number o'er his wounds, Then, with exulting looksâ Man. Forbear, and leave me. Sem. Leave thee!âforbear!âno, while my life remains Thou shalt behold me ever hovering round thee; I'll haunt thee still, and make thy days unhappy. Man. Say when have I deserv'd so many foes? Wherefore this insulting strain? Must I bear a cruel name? Cease, inhuman maid, in vain Cease Mandane's heart to blame. Think, abandon'd to despair, What from thee, ingrate, I prove: Think, Semira, can I bear Hatred from the friend I love? [Exit. SCENE VIII. Semira alone. What has my rashness done? I vainly hop'd That grief divided would decrease the burden; But ah! it weighs the more; while now I thought To ease myself by insults on Mandane, I pierc'd her heart, without relieving mine. 'Tis false to think content we find, Whene'er with us in sorrow join'd, Another's tears o'erflow: To see a friend oppress'd with grief, Affords the afflicted no relief, But swells the sighs of woe. [Exit. SCENE IX. Arbaces alone. Yet here I find her notâO grant, ye powers! That I may calm my lov'd Mandane's anger, Once more behold her, and depart in peace. Perhaps retir'd to some more lone apartment I mayâbut whither would my rashness lead me? O Heaven! Behold she comes! I have no heart To venture in her sight. [retires. SCENE X. Enter Mandane. Man. Let none presume To break on my retirement. [to a page, who [having received the order, departs. Now, my soul, Thou may'st at liberty indulge thy anguish, Thy wild despairâYes, yes, my dear Arbaces, My savage fury shed thy blood, and now My own shall flow to appease thee. [draws a dagger. Arb. Hold! Man. Ye powers! [seeing Arbaces, she lets fall the dagger. Arb. What inconsiderate rage! Man. Arbaces here! In freedom and alive! Arb. A friendly hand Struck off my chains. Man. Fly hence! Be gone! Ah! leave meâ What will be said if here thou art found? Ingrate! Leave then my fame unsullied. Arb. Who can quit His native land without beholding thee? Man. What would'st thou seek from me, perfidious traitor! Arb. Ah! princess; speak not thusâI know full well Thou wear'st a sternness foreign to thy heart. Did I not hear thee? Yes, my dear Mandane, Arbaces heard thy love. Man. 'Tis falsehood all, Or self-deceit; but grant I've spoken aught, My lips, betray'd by use, belied my soul. Arb. Yet am I still the object of your passion. Man. Thou art my detestation. Arb. Cruel maid! Take then this sword, and sate thy utmost rage; Behold my bosom bare to meet the blow. Man. Death would reward, not punish thee. Arb. 'Tis true: Forgive me, I have err'd; but with this hand All shall be heal'd. [about to stab himself. Man. What would'st thou do? Perhaps Thou think'st thy blood sufficient to appease me: No, I would have thy death a spectacle Of public infamy; no mark, no shadow Of generous courage must adorn thy fall. Arb. Ingrate, inhuman! thou shalt have thy wish; [throws away the dagger. I'll seek again my prison. [going. Man. Stay, Arbaces! Arb. What would'st thou say? Man. Alas! I know not what! Arb. And hast thou yet some small degree of love That still detains me here? Man. Enquire no further: Why would'st thou raise my blushes? Save thyselfâ No more afflict me. Arb. Still thou lov'st Arbaces, If thus thou art mov'd to pity him. Man. O no! Believe not that 'tis love: but fly and live! Arb. Thou bid'st me, dear Mandane, live, But if thy love thou wilt not give, My tortur'd heart must break! Man. Ye powers! how cruel is my pain! O let these blushes then explain The thoughts I dare not speak. Arb. Hear me once more. Man. Ah no! Arb. Thou art, Mandaneâ Man. Light of these desiring eyes! Leave me, leave me yet in peace! Both. Tell me when, relentless skies! When your fatal rage will cease? What cannot human life sustain, If life can bear such cruel pain! [Exeunt. SCENE XI. A magnificent place designed for the coronation of Artaxerxes. A throne on one side, with a sceptre, and crown thereon. An altar kindled in the midst, with an image of the Sun. Artaxerxes and Artaban, with a numerous attendance; and People. Artax. To you, my people, I present myself, No less your father than your king: be you My children more than subjects: I'll defend Your lives, your fame; whatever arms may gain, Or peace bestow: do you defend my throne: And let our hearts now make the just exchange Of loyalty and love: the reins of empire I'll sway with gentle hand, and guard the laws Inviolateâthis to perform, to all Religiously I swear. [an attendant brings the cup. Artab. The sacred cup [gives the cup. Receive, and bind thy oath with stronger tiesâ Complete the riteâand drink thy own destruction. [aside. Artax. âBright God! by whom the vernal flowers arise; âBy whom the whole creation lives or dies; âHear!âif my lips the words of falsehood speak, âOn this devoted head your vengeance take: âLet my life fade, as now the languid flame âFades at the pouring of the sacred stream; [sheds part of the wine upon the fire. âAnd while I drink some secret bane infuse; âTo deadly poison change the wholesome juice.â [about to drink. SCENE XII. Enter Semira. Sem. Defend yourself, my lord, the palace wall, Encompass'd by a faithless throng, resounds With rebel shoutsâand all require thy death. Artax. Almighty powers! [places the cup on the altar. Artab. What impious wretch has dar'd To rise against his king? Artax. Alas! too late I know him nowâArbaces is the traitor. Sem. He whom we mourn'd as dead? Artax. He lives, the ingrate: He livesâforgetful of my faith to Xerxes, Forgetful of my duty to my father, I set him free, and merit to receive The punishment which Heaven has destin'd for me: Yes, I myself have woo'd my own destruction. Artab. Why should you fear, my king? For your protection Your faithful Artaban shall still suffice. Artax. Then let us haste to punishâ [going. SCENE XIII. Enter Mandane in haste. Man. Stay, my brother; Great news I bringâthe tumult is appeas'd. Artax. Is't possible? Say, how? Man. The rebel crowd, By Megabyzus led, had reach'd already The inner palace-yard, when brave Arbaces, Rouz'd by the maddening clamour, came to aid thee; What said, what did he not for thy defence? He painted all the horrors of their crime, And show'd the praise that waits on loyalty. He set thy merits and thy fame before them: On some with threats he wrought, on some with prayers; Oft chang'd his looks, from placid to severe; Till each laid down his arms, and Megabyzus, The impious cause of all, alone remain'd; But him he conquer'd, slew, and thus reveng'd thee. Artab. Rash, inconsiderate son! [aside. Artax. Some friendly power Inspir'd me to preserve himâMegabyzus Was author then of every crime committed. Artab. Most fortunate delusion! [aside. Artax. Where is now My lov'd Arbaces? Find and bring him hither. SCENE LAST. Enter Arbaces. Arb. Behold, my lord, Arbaces at your feet. Artax. Come to my breast again: forgive me, friend, That e'er I doubted thee: thy innocence Is now most clear. O give me then the power To recompense thee; from the people's mind Chace every dark suspicion; tell us why That crimson steel was in thy hand; what meant Thy flight, thy silence, all that spoke thee guilty? Arb. O sir! if aught from you I have deserv'd, Permit me to be silent stillâmy lips Are guiltless of a lieâbelieve his faith Who once preserv'd thy lifeâI am innocent. Artax. Swear it at least, and let the solemn rite Confirm thy truth: behold the ready cup, And as the custom of our Persia claims, Call down the God to witness. Arb. I am ready. [takes the cup. Man. Behold my lov'd Arbaces freed from danger. [aside. Artab. Where am I? Should he swear, my son is poison'd. [aside. Arb. âBright God! by whom the vernal flowers arise, âBy whom the whole creation lives or dies.â Artab. O me unhappy! [aside. Arb. âIf I falsehood speak, âThis wholesome beverageââ [about to drink. Artab. Hold! the cup is poison'd. Artax. What do I hear? Arb. O Gods! Artax. And why till now Didst thou conceal it from me? Artab. 'Twas for thee I had prepar'd it. Artax. What could urge thy rage? Artab. Dissimulation can no more avail: Paternal love already has betray'd me. I was the murderer of Xerxes; all The royal blood I sought to shed: 'tis I Am guilty, not Arbaces: to his hand, I, to conceal it, gave the bloody weapon. His looks proclaim'd his horror for my crime; His silence the compassion of a son. O! had not virtue wrought so strong in him, Or love in me, I had fulfill'd my purpose, And had depriv'd thee now of life and empire. Artax. Perfidious wretch! my father hast thou murder'd, And made me guilty of Darius' death! To what excesses has thy impious thirst Of greatness led thee!âTraitor, thou shalt die. Artab. At least we'll die together. [draws his sword, Artaxerxes does the same. Arb. Heavens! Artab. My friends, [to the rebels. Heed not his threats, the feeble last remains Of desperationâlet the tyrant die. [the guards, seduced by Artaban, prepare to attack Artaxerxes. Arb. What would'st thou do, my father? Artab. Bravely perish. Arb. Lay by thy sword, or here I drink my death. Artab. What say'st thou, ha! Arb. O, if you kill my friend, My Artaxerxes, I can live no longer. Artab. Let me complete what I've begun. [going to attack Artaxerxes. Arb. Take heed, Or here I drink. [about to drink. Artab. Hold then, ungrateful son! And dost thou wish to see thy father die, Because too well he lov'd thee? Yes, ingrate, Yes, thou hast conquer'dâthereâbehold my sword. [throws away his sword, and the rebel guards fly. Man. Faith unexampled! Sem. Treachery unequall'd! Artax. Pursue the rebels, and let Artaban Be led to instant death. Arb. O Heaven!âyet stay; Have pity, sir. Artax. Hope not for mercy for him, His crime's too great: yet think not I confound The innocent and guilty; thou Arbaces Shalt wed Mandane, and the fair Semira With me divide the throne; but for that traitor No pardon can be granted. Arb. Take my life, I ask it not, if by my truth to you, If, by preserving you, I kill my father! Artax. O virtue that excites our admiration! Arb. I do not ask your mercy for myself; Be rigorous stillâbut change his death for mine. Hear him, who once preserv'd you, at your feet [kneels. Now kneeling beg to suffer for a father. Thus, thus appease your justice, shed my blood, And, shedding mine, the blood of Artaban. Artax. O riseâno moreâdry up those generous tears, Who can resist thee? Artaban shall live, But let him live at least in mournful exile. Thus far thy sovereign grants thy pious suit; The virtuous son preserves the guilty father. CHORUS. Great King! with reverence Persia sees Mercy seated on the throne, When forgiveness she decrees A hero's loyalty to crown. Justice still we brighter find, When with godlike Pity join'd!
