      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. A hall in the house of Didius. Cornelius &amp; Abascantus watch while a number of Slaves arrange objects of art and luxury in full light. CORNELIUS. BOUGHT FROM PERTINAX? ABASCANTUS. BUT SECRETLY. THE EMPEROR, IT WAS RUMOURED, SEt A TRAP To catch our men of substance by the sale Of every luxury dead Commodus Left treasured in the palace: those who bought Would be accounted shamefully inclined To softness and expense. My head is long, A Syrian head in fine; my patron lusted To own these tables wrought of thuja-wood, On ivory feet, and these enamelled beds; These priceless vases of Corinthian bronze And murrhine that at touch of poison breaks: He lusted; it was clear I must obtain. No member of his household, slave or free, Peered in upon the sale, but eastern merchants Bought, as if self-directed, at my choice. Now, during this most private hour of day, When visitors and clients have withdrawn, My patron will review his purchases By sunlight and in peace. CORNELIUS. Gods, Abascantus, But for your constant friendship to my hopes I should despair! ABASCANTUS. You come of noble race, And though you are but poor, a wealthy kinsman Lies on his death-bed. CORNELIUS. And a month ago A gypsy-Jewess, by a shady tree, Asked from her bed of hay a passing alms, Boasting she knew the Talmud and was born The High Priest's daughter. When I loosed my purse, She took a pigeon's entrails from her wallet, And told me my rich uncle would be dead Before the moon was old; but I believe The dotard is immortal as Tithonus. ABASCANTUS. All obstacles are mortal to the strong; Obstruction on the highway every freeman Clears as his will inclines. CORNELIUS. The man is dead By right of years, by justice of the Fates; I find him on his couch expressionless As if his soul had through his wrinkles ebbed, And madden with the near accomplishment Of all my youth desires . . . he will not die. That green senility should waste my life, Ha!âit is monstrous. ABASCANTUS. And you never thought That chance can have a port, if mortals steer? Abridge the journey to your heritage, And so attain your wedding. CORNELIUS. Abascantus! ABASCANTUS. Seduce Euanthes, his Cilician page, To mix his bowl of wine. CORNELIUS. And afterward You are persuaded Didius Julianus Will freely yield his daughter? ABASCANTUS. She has reached Her eighteenth year and soon she must be married To satisfy the law. She was a child When her new-plighted husband, still a boy, Sickened and died: since then her father's love Has kept her by its jealousy a virgin Longer than custom warrants; but 'tis noted You have a kindlier welcome from your host Than any other youth. CORNELIUS. I have your favour; On that I build. Is Didius hard to move? Read me his temper, for I find his face Inscrutable as Fortune's. ABASCANTUS. He possesses, And yet he has no hold on anything. Flutists and poets, the young pantomime Of the imperial household, Pylades, Surround and entertain him, but he shares None of their gifts: he is a magistrate; Before him all incline, while none obey His large commands: he loves his opulence; No miser like your uncle, but a judge And purchaser of beauty. Have you marked His countenance?âa very Jove's in beard And hair and open brow; and yet his eye Has never dealt the lightning and his lip Makes bond-slaves happy . . . You are lost in thought. CORNELIUS. The drug, the drug . . . ABASCANTUS. Consult Diodotus, My rare physician. CORNELIUS. You have intellect To hold the earth itself in stewardship, Imperial treasurer! ABASCANTUS. The very office I covet most. But what we might have been With opportunity is of such thinking As enervates our present; therefore peace! My patron!âlike a sea-god from the bath. (Enter Didius Julianus,) DIDIUS. Cornelius Repentinus? CORNELIUS. Noble sir, Your friend. DIDIUS. And welcome! How much of a friend I see that Abascantus has discovered, Since he, the prudent, sets you in the midst Of private treasure. Ah, this work is fine, As if the dawn had turned to craftsmanship And traced a pearly chequer. How the touch Yearns to these handles, the delicious bronze, With the white smoothness of its fashioning. Those tables, those great vases! Abascantus, See, they lack space &amp; light &amp; long approachâ A palace to surround them. Lovely things Are made for their own universe, and these Are gods in exile, for this narrow house Seems a mere prison: I have had fresh courtyards But newly built, and yet I breathe no air; Fresh alleys added to the garden, yet No coolness greets me; all is circumscribed. CORNELIUS. You need a golden palace. DIDIUS. My possessions Need it, in very truth. Cornelius, say, Is it not strange that Pertinax should ravish The well-filled Regia of its ornaments, And cast them out as sometimes stars are cast From their fit setting? CORNELIUS. Strange!âUnnatural. DIDIUS. The word; and tasteless. Yet the good old man Is not a miser, but economist, Making life paltry for its benefit; As if the lust of prodigality Could be removed and life still own its power, Or he gain aught but hatred. ABASCANTUS. Those who rule Must spend as sowers. CORNELIUS. Pertinax, they say, Would rather rule with innocence a realm Poor as himself than fill a treasury By wise offence. DIDIUS. We must commend his wish; His practice soon will ruin him. Ah, well, I praise your purchase, treasurer, and blame My house alone that I am discontent. Command the slaves to carry out these treasures. (To Cornelius, who advances to say farewell.) Nay, nay, Cornelius, 'tis a festival; My wife and daughter, far too long a while Absent at Tibur, yielding to my prayers, Return to me at last. If you would greet them, Extend your courtesy and sup. CORNELIUS. My heart You know full well is ever in this house. DIDIUS. There goes my vase to darkness; and it wounds Some bounty in me when such loveliness Is buried as if dead, for I would grant All that is fair the light; it is the gold By which true beauty lives; and I am driven, Beneath the curse of Pertinax, to starve Gems of their sun, myself of my desire. (Exeunt Abascantus and all the slaves.) And you will stay? 'Tis well. CORNELIUS. I am impatient Once more to see your daughter. DIDIUS. She is fair, My Didia Clara. CORNELIUS. Hebe not so fair! DIDIUS, And is a perfect Grecian; she can speak The language of delight without the flaws That mar her native tongue; and she can dance And play upon the lute, yet is not learned, A woman's weariest failing, but is nourished On arts and pleasant culture. (Enter Didia Clara and Manlia Scantilla.) Why, you come As from the springs of Tibur like a nymph, Fresh crispness in your hair and on your cheek How delicate a bloom! Wife, she is well? MANLIA, But truly I am thankful she returns, Dear husband, to your guardianship; her beauty Grows so resplendent it is perilous To let her take the air. CORNELIUS. Then, noble lady, Consign her to my charge. MANLIA. Cornelius! (To Clara.) Greet him! CLARA. Most ceremonious greeting. Give me news, The newest news; I am behind all count. There must have been a fire; the wind was high, It promised wrecks. CORNELIUS. Three off Misenum swallowed Entirely by the swell. And in the dark Five houses on the Aventine collapsed, Making a funeral without expense For five-and-eighty corpses. DIDIUS. Leave disaster! The athlete, young Narcissus, has prevailed Against Aurelius Helix and has won The wreath of oak and olive intertwined. CLARA. And Pylades? DIDIUS. Is in disgrace. One day While dancing Leda with soft witchery, Beyond all praise, and sure that anything Would be permitted to his impudence, When Marcus Curius the Praetor hissed, Our fair girl-boy with jeering finger showed His enemy to all. The Emperor listened Next morning to complaints, for Pertinax Was never friend to art, and gave command That Pylades should be chastised at noon Upon the public stage; I saw him there, For once unheralded by music, stripped, And fronting us the first time in his life With naked face, one fire and then one snow. He stood against the rods unflinchingly, His hum of pain was scarcely audible, And soon as he was loosed with mocking gesture He gave salute as if he took applause, But left the theatre with no golden youth Of Rome to give him escort. Days and nights The boy lay sick and inconsolable; Till, healed at last and muffled in his cloak, He sought the theatre yesterday. We waited; Before us tents and deftly-painted waves Illusive stretched: then Ajax held the scene, With movements full of curses, gory weapon And raging hands and head. The people rose, While âPylades, our Pylades!â was shouted As if from earth to heaven. It seemed we saw The open breast of wrath before our eyes; Its conflagration seethed expressively, As, Proteus-like, the dancer took each figure And shape of rageâthe vehemence and swiftness Of flame in motion, fury of a lion, And fierceness of a leopard; then the shaking Of oak the winds have lashed, or else the current Of Tiber's flood: it was a miracle! For by the outer gestures of his body His passion was discovered and released, And yet he knew what would become him best, And so behaved, not once too much transported Beyond his art's decorum. He had snatched A triumph out of shame; 'twas rarely done. CLARA. Is the boy here? DIDIUS. No, but is coming soon. He did not sleep, and from the earliest hour The Dancing School is open, he attended, Perfecting some new part untiringly, With spell-bound eyes: he should be calmed and kept From such excess of work, although it heals The wound his pride has suffered. CLARA. He will dance? DIDIUS. I found the Emperor incensed so far Against the arrogance of Pylades, He thought the rods too light to punish it, Unless with them he coupled banishment: I had to plead his promise of the loan For your return of his rare pantomime, Though justice was not satisfied. My child, Your pulse is hurried, you have felt the heat Of the Flaminian Road beneath the sun. CLARA. Nothing!âfatigue. CORNELIUS. You favour Pylades, He is your chosen dancer? You choose well. I will implore the gods for his success In the new part he cons, since all you love Is to my heart preferred. MANLIA. How amiable! Husband, this noble youth and our dear child Have common admirations, common tastes, Are matched in height, and each is foil to each As ruby to the diamond: let them wed. CORNELIUS. I kneel as to a god. DIDIUS. Nay, patience, sir. When we desire what is so beautiful We do not lose our patience . . . And to part! Clara, my child! Would you had been a vestal, Then I had seen you often in high place, Sure that no man could ever call you his. Clara! CLARA. Dear father, yours indeed is love Such as I may not look for in a husband. Why, I have all your thoughts, &amp; how to please me Is, I dare boast, the purpose of each hour. DIDIUS. My chief ambition. MANLIA. It is supper-time, Cornelius; after supper, I again May try to urge your suit. A meal revives Our hopes and our persistence. DIDIUS. Stay a little; The lady Marcia prayed to welcome you. So old a friend! CLARA. Gods, how I hate old friends! And you, Cornelius? CORNELIUS. Tell me of your hatreds; They shall be mine. CLARA. I hate your poverty. Grow rich! CORNELIUS. I promise. CLARA. Rome shall never say You sought me for my fortune. How I wish Your uncle could be murdered! CORNELIUS. You will yield me Your hand when I inherit? DIDIUS. Loveliest jewel, You jest at murder! CLARA. Every one I hate I instantly wish dead. Old Pertinax, Who grows each day a little worthier still, More careful of the poor, more scrupulous, Can no one murder him? DIDIUS. Hush, child! No bloodshed! And do not rage at Pertinax; his sale Of slaves has given me opportunity Of purchasing a dwarf, a very gem, The creature Commodus had cast in bronze. They bring him. (Enter Slaves with Gabba and with rich gifts.) CLARA. Something fresh at last! I know Each wretched menial by heartâinstead Of having our dependants ranked in groups According to their colour, blond with blond, One lovely, golden group, and in relief The duskier complexions of one dye So delicately matching that the choice Of ministrant leaves in the memory No little, jarring hollow: Commodus Was served with such perfection. MANLIA. You have touched The very point: we are not rich in slaves. DIDIUS. My carefulness for safety! Pertinax Looks ill on all display. You do not notice Your most engaging monster. CLARA. Can it dance, Or stand upon that Atlas-ball of skull? It cannot catch my skirt, it has no hands. The lump is cross and stupid; put it down! It shall be whipped unless at supper-time It wake up to buffoonery. DIDIUS. Nay, nay! Even prodigies must learn they are at home. CLARA. He cost you dear? DIDIUS. Ah, child, he is a gift. So are these pearls, this hyacinth-coloured mantle, Once owned by an Augusta. Yet, alas, While Pertinax is watchful, these must lie Unworn within your press. CLARA. Would he could go The way of Commodus! CORNELIUS. We must be married, For we are one already. (Enter Marcia.) MANLIA. Dearest Marcia, At last we welcome you. MARCIA. Hush! There is news I have no strength to utter, and a peril I must not think of. Pertinax is dead, More terrible, is slain. CLARA. The gods be praised! CORNELIUS. They bless our wishes. MANLIA. Marcia, do not gasp . . . Is slainâby whom? MARCIA. By his Praetorian Guard The good, old man was butchered. Infamy! DIDIUS. I do not like this violence . . . MANLIA. But the issue? Dear Marcia, calm yourself. DIDIUS. You spoke of peril . . . Your husband! Is Eclectus safe? MARCIA. God knows! He would not leave his Emperor. DIDIUS. Loyal heart! Can such fidelity be possible, Do mortals knit so close? MARCIA. They died together, If he were in the palace. DIDIUS. Nay, I trustâ At noon he crossed the Stadium leisurelyâ You are not yet a widow. (Re-enter Abascantus.) Abascantus, There is a passion in your steps as if The treasure-vessels from your Syrian coasts Had touched at Ostia: check your eagerness, For Pertinax is dead. When CÃ¦sar dies, He still is CÃ¦sar, and the throne is shaken As if an earthquake passed. ABASCANTUS. An hour ago That was the talk of Rome. The corpse must cool Before the funeral-rites; a yesterday Must be of age, to interest. Noble patron, The past is swept away, our policy Changed on the instant, and the loaded coffers I guard and with my watchfulness increase Surrendered to your service, for the world Is now at auction, and your price the highest That any Roman has the power to bid. Come quickly to the camp. DIDIUS. You break designs As if they were accomplishment. ABASCANTUS. They are When revenue conducts them. MARCIA. Rome for sale! The Empire offered! Didius, do not listen; There is no verity behind this cry: The world may be possessed in many ways, It may not know its lord; but, oh, believe me, It has its CÃ¦sar; nothing alters that, No howling of a little, greedy crowd. Why should you rule this city? Have you raised it To higher honour? Have you borne its griefs? Will it remember you? ABASCANTUS. On all the coins A safe, a graven memory. (To Didius.) Do you stoop To justify yourself to . . . oh, a lady High in esteem, but not a lawful Empress, A Nazarene and friend of slaves. More meetly You should desire the quickening approbation Of wife and daughter. An imperial beauty Is at your side, a noble consort, wealth To make all unaccustomed places smooth As the floor's treading . . . and you hesitate! Come with me to the camp. DIDIUS. So suddenly This fortune crosses me. CLARA. But claim it, father; I stifle with impatience. MANLIA. Dearest husband, You have the very majesty of Jove, So gentle, so urbane, that you will slip Into a throne nor note its quality. All is so smooth! DIDIUS. Ay, in Olympus, smooth! Among the happy gods, there I could rule; But to contend . . . Go, treasurer, to the camp With a large freedom. Bring me word again How you have prospered. MANLIA. Say that he will rule Nobly as Numa. DIDIUS. That would damage me, That was the error of poor Pertinax. Be lavish, Abascantus. ABASCANTUS. Come yourself. Men do not win the world by sending stewards With liberty of purchase: all is vain Without the master's voice. DIDIUS. I will not come; I cannot. Do I ever choose the slaves, Or look upon my treasure till 'tis wiped Of blood and filthy contact? Must I strive, All Plutus in reserve? Do what you will, Take any means, but keep me from the forum, Men's faces; there are murderers in the crowd: All men in mass are murderers. Stand aside, Mutter your promises; if you can buy A palace, paying honestly the price, If it is simply that . . . (Looking uneasily toward Marcia.) No deity Making the contract awful . . . ABASCANTUS. (Aside to Clara.) Work on him; I fear that woman. (Exit.) DIDIUS. (To Marcia.) Is Rome bought and sold? Alas, you see, she is. A purchaser Is not ashamed to trade in noblest blood, If once a state of servitude is owned: We traffic in all creatures, and, if fate Allow the traffic, we are justified. MARCIA. You are forbidden; something holds you back. Rome to be bought! (Showing the city.) Look there! DIDIUS. But if I stood, An army at my back to overwhelm, You would not interpose. MARCIA. It is the strong, And they must be accoutred by the godsâ What helmets and what spears!âwho may prevail In circumstance so awful. Dare you call The Mighty Helpers who have fought for Rome To aid you in this enterprise? I know The day will come she will bear many evils, And many kingdoms build their seat on her: But touch her with a manacle for gold! O Didius, do not dream that what is done Of foolish men can ever come to pass; It is the Sibyls' books that are fulfilled, The propheciesâno doings of a crowd; They are laid by as dust. âIf fate allow,â You say, âthe traffic!â You may change the current And passage of whole kingdoms by not knowing Just what is infamy: a common deed It may be, nothing monstrous to the eye, And yet your children may entreat the hills To hide them from its terror. Be dissuaded: I know what one may do, and what it is To strike predestined blows; but this attempt Will lead you to wide ruin. DIDIUS. Clara, child, You lay this dearest head against my shoulder, You clasp my arm as if to make entreaty; But, for your sake, if this should prove a gift That secretly should blight you! CLARA. Give it me. You say I am the apple of your eye, You say I am your idol, praise my beauty, And yet you shut it in the dark for ever, As you have shut away your murrhine vase, If now you let another rise more high, Another pass beyond me; be most sure I never shall have pleasure any more From any gift you give, in any honour You may attempt to win, if you refuse My marvellous, full title. Indiscreetly Cornelius let it drop into my ear; From him it has no meaning: you may breathe it, And with it breath of joy on all my youth. MANLIA. Husband, I join my prayers. CLARA. There is no need, For the great suit is won. I know when Jove Flushes benignant. DIDIUS. Ah, Cornelius, see! This is a smile to win, and you have heard That I alone can win it. Is it so? (Re-enter Abascantus.) Well, Abascantus, do we rule the world? ABASCANTUS. You must appear in person. I have bribed With promises, but still the soldiers shout, âLet Didius come himself and raise the price Sulpicianus bids.â DIDIUS. Sulpicianus! It is unseemly he should leave the corse Of a dear son-in-law unvisited . . . ABASCANTUS. His speech is artful and your fluent lips Are needed with their generosity, For he is winning power the thievish way Of subtle eloquence. CORNELIUS. If you should speak, Most gracious sir, we cannot doubt the issue; Your golden mouth and not your golden coffers Will earn you sovereignty. DIDIUS. If I must speak? Why, soâit is my gift! Sulpicianus Will scarcely there be master. You must leave me To ponder on my periods. By-and-by, If with security I can provide These palaces and thrones . . . (To Marcia.) Eclectus lives, Marcia, be sure of that, and if I rule Shall be most near to me in trust. Go in! (Exeunt all but Abascantus and Gabba, who has been forgotten.) And, treasurer, count my gold. ABASCANTUS. No counting now; You must appease the soldiers, or, inflamed, They lift Sulpicianus on their shields. You lose the precious instant. DIDIUS. Face this Rome, This populace! I never wanted words, They streamed up to my lips so fluently; And now I am ashamed and cannot speak. But leave meâcount my gold; for if my treasure Lie not in solid heaps upon the floor I will not stir a foot. (Exit Abascantus.) If this delay Should save me from my doom! And yet I fear . . . His jaws locked on a suddenâtreasurer Of the imperial chests!âwhile I must traverse Wide halls and palaces with no more right Than if I were a ghost; I am not CÃ¦sar; Marcia said true; and now this awful charge Is laid upon me a strange emptiness Fills me with lassitude. How should I speak? These Roman citizens, who were my neighbours, Who were my friends, are foreign to me now: If they will be my slaves, they may be happy; But that is the condition, and to that Will the PrÃ¦torians yield? I am struck dumb. The gold must speak; for at whatever price Rome rate herself I am her purchaser, And the great gods, the silent companies, Must sit around and scoff. (Perceiving Gabba.) Odd, little package, In all the hubbub you have never moved. Do you too wait on fortune? GABBA. I am hungry. DIDIUS. And I can promise supper-time. You know Your master has been slaughtered? GABBA. Commodus Was my true master. DIDIUS. Then you do not weep? GABBA. Except for supper. DIDIUS. Would you like to live Again in the old palace? GABBA. This is scarcely The lodging for a dwarf: I need more space. Cooped up, I am ridiculous. (Re-enter Abascantus.) ABASCANTUS. How just! My patron, we must part with him and quickly To the new Emperor. DIDIUS. Thus the coffers doom? You have been long away. ABASCANTUS. In colloquy With logic and with chance. Sulpicianus Will offer at the least five thousand drachms To every soldier: of his honesty He can pledge that. DIDIUS. And I a thousand more. We have these sums, or they are on the way. ABASCANTUS. They never will arrive: but you must go And brag like Hercules, no point reserved, If you would give your heaps of jewels light, See your rare vases placed, and claim the service Of Pylades, the wing-foot dancer, perfect As gem or vase. And there must be no question, No scruple, if Augusta and her dwarf . . . DIDIUS. Clara Augusta! But revolted soldiers . . . GABBA. Murder! ABASCANTUS. And bloodshed! Hail, Sulpicianus! Ours is but merchants' traffic. DIDIUS. I will bid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. The Triclinium in the house of Didius: an hour later. Marcia sits at the end of one of the couches, her face hidden in her hands, as if she were praying. Behind her stands a table covered with the remains of a rich feast. Manlia &amp; Clara stand together by a window, looking out: a few Slaves move about anxiously. CLARA. Do not look out! Mother, it sickens me. MANLIA (skinning a Persian apple.) Be patient, child! CLARA. My father can go forth And buy the world as simply as he buys A slave-girl at the market. MANLIA. And he will. When did he disappoint you? CLARA. He will wrangle. To think those men are wrangling on the walls, And he may lose the moment! O this gold, To-day discovered royal! Romulus Founded his city, and how many heroes Have given their lives to win it, sudden tyrants Have ravished it; and yet it shall be ours By simple purchase, MANLIA. With no bloodshed, no Long, wasting siege or misery: at last The merchant's honest traffic with his wares, Yielding them up to him who has most gold, Is proved to be of service to the State. Therefore let every man secure such wealth As will command the market of his hopes! If he desire a lovely slave, the price Is known to him; but if he have ambition Of boundless honour, like your noble father, He must not weary of amassing fortune Till he have in reserve, as now, a sum That, though the world be rated dear or cheap, Can buy the world. CLARA. If I were only sure That riches are all-powerful! MANLIA. But they are: In youth, in age, and for the life to come In our posterity; the single comfort In sickness or disgrace; and in the hour Of death how often I have seen the features Of dying men rekindle as they pictured The passing glory of their funerals, And splendour of a timeless sepulchre. CLARA. Oh then, I will look forth. Beyond your range I see my father's figure down below, And messengers are passing quick between The bidders and the camp. Now he is checked, He hesitatesâthey urge him, he recoils. MANLIA. Impossible! You cannot see so far. CLARA. This is the moment for rich eloquence, The speech outstripping possibility. Could I be there! Why, I would say the cities they had sacked, The temples they had plundered, the fair tombs They had despoiled were nothing to the sluices My word could open to them, endless treasure That I would bid them bathe in as a bath, If they would straightway lift me on their shields, Proclaiming me their Emperor. Faugh, this pause! So children suffer, seeing fathers mar The deeds they could accomplish perfectly As Pylades his dance: but they are young, Mere girls and boys, and dotards rule the world. MANLIA. Nay, do not be so violent. When he comes, This wonderful, kind father with his gift . . . CLARA. I promise I will kiss the messenger Who brings the news. (Enter Narcissus.) MARCIA. Say that Eclectus lives. Narcissus, speak! NARCISSUS. I cannot tell. CLARA. Be brief! NARCISSUS. Lady, Sulpicianus bids so high . . . CLARA. Back, back! Go to my father; say, except He give me my desire I kill myself; Say that this stake is wagered for my love, Therefore there is no limit to the risks That he must straight encounter. Harry him! (Exit Narcissus.) He would not dare to slink back to his home, Like a defeated athlete from the games. Mother, he dare not. MANLIA. All that is, is well. There must be painful moments in each life: When they descend on others' lives our duty Is to avert our eyes, when on our own, It is our duty to lay by the cup, As healthy children say the draught has cured They were too wise to drink. And should your father Fail to succeed we will congratulate Sulpicianus on his victory, And win high place about his court. Success Is always to be worshipped. CLARA. Flatterer To others' happy fortune! I would give My envy, my disparagement: but mine, My own success, I would make boast of it Till men should gather round me as a god. I often say to Pylades the Bacchus He worships so devoutly was a youth, A boisterous youngster with thick hair that curled, Like his, across the fillet, and a colour To drive men mad, who tripped down to the towns Drunken, and singing of his great success. If we will take the highways with our voices, We all may be divinities. (Enter Eclectus.) MARCIA. My husband, Safe, safe! ECLECTUS (embracing her.) And there are tears across these eyes! O wife, O friends, it was a cruel deed To slay our good old Emperor. I lingered Late at the baths, when, how I cannot tell, A rumour seemed to enter through the walls Ghostlike that Pertinax was foully slain; We all became aware, yet heard and spoke As if the dreadful Pan affrighted us Beyond control of courage. In the streets A cry, a market cry, went shrieking up, With trumpet-blast, that we and Rome herself Were offered at the soldiers' camp for sale. What shame! And Laetusâdown the forum went His long procession under lifted shields, And high above a single pike transfixed The head that I revere. Sulpicianus . . . MARCIA. We know. ECLECTUS. But where is Didius? MARCIA. Underneath The walled PrÃ¦torian Camp. ECLECTUS. You mean? CLARA. We mean My father will outbid Sulpicianus, And soon will be your Emperor. MANLIA. What is good Is no less good when paid for; and the rule Of such a man as Didius will confirm The peace and the prosperity of Rome. You are mistaken, friend, to talk of shame: Gold has its justice, rites, and honour, all Conformable to reason, and my husband Observes them in his dealing. (Enter Pylades.) CLARA. Pylades! (As he salutes he reels.) You drunken boy! PYLADES. But, lady, this is sleep's Own drunkenness; I cannot help myself. Long veils, so hot and delicate, are drawn Across my eyes, and then I nearly fall. I had no sleep last night. CLARA. Sit down and feed; You must be hungry. PYLADES. No, except for sleep. MARCIA. There is a rug; lie down. (He salutes her &amp; throws himself on a Babylonian carpet at her feet.) PYLADES. I came to dance, But pray to be forgiven a little while; I am so weary. MANLIA. Rest! CLARA. You know the news That Pertinax is murdered? PYLADES. And his head Is tossing on a pike for all to see, Up hill, down street. ECLECTUS. You can rejoice? PYLADES. I must. CLARA. You have good reason, you! PYLADES. For he was grim; He never gave a feast, and the whole city Was kept so ordered and so still, no music Outside the doors, no laughter in the night; Dull streets and orderâevery one at home Ready to die of virtue. ECLECTUS. It is well You have no duty to the State. PYLADES. Not I! The State! I only know our guards have done A most illustrious deed. ECLECTUS. Your patron, boy! PYLADES. He never was my patron. Willingly He would have sold me, had I been a slave, With all the chariots and the golden plate, The robes of silk, the pages, dwarfs, and girls Of my true patron Commodus. I long To have the good times back againâof crime, Full feasts and luxury; the palace mine, My very theatre, torches and gay troops And company. We artists almost starved, Within my house I had but twenty slaves, My fortune fell to half; the men I care for, While Pertinax was reigning, crept away To sport among the gods. CLARA. The women? PYLADES. Oh, Their place is with the artists, and they lost Their beauties one by one. (He shivers, and Clara throws a leopard-skin over him.) Thanks; you have wrapped me Divinely as Nausicaa. MANLIA. Ah, you name The daughter of a king. Good augury! For, listen, Pylades, within an hour She will be regal: the PrÃ¦torian Guards Have put the Empire up for sale; my husband Is bidding high. PYLADES. (yawning) O pardon me, dear lady! What, the rich Didius borne aloft on shields And carried to the Regia! Momus, io! I wish I were not sleepy. CLARA. Do not jest. Think, Pylades, a palace all your own, Myself your Empress, think! PYLADES. Nay, I will dream, Dream the good luck. Delicious! CLARA. He can sleep . . . Crossed feet, shut mouth! MANLIA. The boy is beautiful; No mask he wears is equal to his face. We soon shall be his patrons, and our favour Will reinstate him. Shame to have him flogged! I think we should be grateful and behave Indulgently to those who can amuse; They give us pastime, let them have their whims, At least when they are famed and beautiful. Yet, Juno! it was shocking indiscretion To flout the PrÃ¦tor, though it makes me smile. ECLECTUS. These dancers are the mortal pest of Rome: They sap its honour and its ancient strength Like fever from the plains. Our populace Applauds the din of stamping to a flute, The wanton jumpings of a lunatic, Who takes all sorts of colours like a fish, And in one body keeps so many souls He cannot claim his own. This recreant boy, Who has no loyalty, to think he sways The blood of thousands, drawing to his side Our men and women of supremest rank Whenever his white tunic and white shoes Are seen along the street! Tho' Pertinax Was resolute to have him taught his place, It was in vain; you flatter and console And crown the rods with bay. MANLIA. Fie, you are strict! Cornelius comes. (Enter Cornelius with Narcissus: Clara remains gazing fixedly at Pylades.) CORNELIUS. My Empress and my wife! Pardon, my Clara, I must join my hopes To my deep homage, or in yielding it My breath would fail. The glory does not distance Or drive me to despair, for all my worship Is of your beauty, and as woman you Would wish that worship constant. Long ago I gave you Venus' apple. CLARA. Pylades Is sleepingâhush! (falling back into her mother's arms.) O mother, it is sweet, This life you gave me . . . now I breathe the world. What ecstasy! Cornelius, greet my father, Go to him quickly, say his daughter lives To serve him as a god. CORNELIUS. What gratitude! Lady, your lover, your affianced husband, Opening the sluices of this glory, looks For recompense, a lover's recompense. CLARA. Have you then bought the world for me? I know A crowd of suitors press round every throne; But leave me for a little while in peace. Kings do not think of those that clasp their feet; They think of the great stretches of their rule, How far their sentence travels. Let me be! Cornelius, you chafe yme! MANLIA. Gently, child. A youth of noble birth. CORNELIUS. And birth alone Can save your majesty from ridicule . . . I wooed you for your beauty, 'tis your beauty Keeps me a suitor: if we wed, my race Ennobles you. An old, patrician house, You cannot bid for that. CLARA. Mad arrogance! Birthâthe tradition of an energy The world has washed out ruthless as the print Of horseman on the sand! What, do you boast? Some scion of Olympus? But my father Creates me Empress, as Jove's self created A goddess on the instant. I am his, At his disposal: he will hesitate Long 'mid my kingly suitors. CORNELIUS. You are rash. Your father took another tone; he knows Intruders must be prudent: as his son I bore these tidings; but I hesitate, Finding you guardian of a pantomime . . . Meet office for the lady I have sought To rule my household, to maintain my honour! Between us just this slave, whose precious sleep (slightly kicking Pylades.) I do not fear to break! Ho, there, Eclectus! Have you no manners? You were chamberlain, If my young memory serve, to Pertinax. Conduct me to the Regia. (turning toward Clara &amp; Pylades.) Magical! I have not touched a ripple of his dreams, So deeply he is drugged. Are these your spells? Love-philtres for a dancer, fie! My Empress, My sometime bride, farewell. (Exeunt Cornelius and Eclectus.) CLARA. He couples names How far asunder! Empress, and a wife! But the great name sails to me as a ship Laden with spices. To unpack the sweets, Oh how, before old age? At last my pleasure, Mine, mine, my will to carry through the world. First I will wake this lad. What flush of sunrise Will light his cheek illumined by my joy. How often in the theatre he awakes A woman, turning amorous to her god! But no, not yet! I will bend over him As full Augusta. Mother, in an hour We shall be summoned to the Regia. Quick, help me to array! O Pylades! (Exeunt Clara and Manlia.) NARCISSUS. Now she will claim her minion; he is doomed . . . And such a dancer, with a body firm And supple as an athlete's. Have you seen How on the instant he can check himself, As if my art were his, and yet each gesture Can plead beyond the power of oratory; For he has learnt his skill from Heracles, And Maia's son, and Pollux? MARCIA. Oh, to save him! NARCISSUS. An amorous prayerâby winning him yourself? If you have set your heart on him, although He is my dearest friend, I tell you, Marcia, I'll slay him sleeping. MARCIA. And this thirst for blood I taught you when I prayed you, on my knees, With your own hands to murder Commodus. NARCISSUS. Why did you pray? Because chance gave you sight Of your own doom inscribed upon a leaf By the mad tyrant who for years had proved The marvel of your patience? Did you ask My help to save your life? It was my dream. In joy I put forth every muscle's tact Neatly to end the wretch. . . . And all that while I wrought to save Eclectus who was vowed With you to death; it was for him alone You slew the Emperor, using me as tool. Well, hirelings and assassins must be paid! How handsome you are lookingâI could say Almost as handsome as the famous night You took me by the shoulders, whispered close, Thus . . . Do not shudder! MARCIA (repelling him.) Come, my brave Narcissus, You raised me up from bondage into life; You sole, not Pylades. I have no terror In looking at the deed; I kiss your hands, I take the murder as my own, some day Shall suffer for it: when we least remember We find that fate forgets not. NARCISSUS. I no less Remember you and I are one in deed, Although you flaunt now as Eclectus' wife. MARCIA. Narcissus, there is wrestling of a sort You are not trained in, when strong spirits throw Unworthy combatants. You offered me Your services if ever I should need This wrist of iron; and, if I claimed your strength, My claim was your reward. Go forth a man, A victor with the worthless, glorious wreath, My gratitude. NARCISSUS. O Marcia, how you rule, How inwardly you change me from a brute, Even as my training fits me for the games. There is no woman like you, Amazon! You set me in the mood that fills my heart When the whole Stadium shouts. But lay your wreath Upon my brow, touching with lips that crown. You condescend! Farewell. Save Pylades. (Exit Narcissus.) MARCIA. The will of Didia Clara must be thwarted, This slumber gently broken. Pylades, Look up, awake! PYLADES. A dull Endymion To such a golden priestess of the light! For I have slept a century and dreamed Of a great palace throbbing in the sun. Ah, I remember I was half-asleep, I scarcely understood. But has our CrÅsus Purchased the Empire? MARCIA. Manlia and her daughter Are busy sorting out imperial clothes. PYLADES. Or what they think imperial. Venus check Her chariot with its incense and perfumesâ Paint the new beauty slowly! You are here; You waken me, we are alone, together, Your thoughts are with me, Domina. MARCIA. Fair boy, For I would save you. PYLADES. How? And from what harm? I am no longer sick, no more unhappy, Save that you do not love me, whom I love More than my feet the music of the reeds, More than my blood applause. Why should you give Eclectus all your love? MARCIA. I do not, child. I love those Christians rescued from the mines By just a word to Commodus; I love, Ah, almost any face where I can set A smile on the dark features. You are puzzled? And yet the gods for many thousand years Have loved by blessing: it is so I love. PYLADES. Then you speak falsely. Love is but a wound To suffer or inflict and nothing more. You may give benefits or take them, that Is traffic for senility; the young Will not be sated so: but you are talking As Marcia could not, as a Nazarene. MARCIA. A Christian. It is idle, Pylades, To tell you of our mysteries: your feet Are rhythmic only to the pulse of life That Earth herself has prompted, to the passions She gave to men and they have reared as gods. PYLADES. I am the dancer to Olympus. Cease! You would not have me break the harmony That is my law; for dancers must have calm, Unclouded thoughts of all things. As for me, When once the motion of the music stirs My questionless response, I have no care For anything but beauty: all men do And feel and suffer is unblameable In that large, beating sway. MARCIA. Beloved of Rome, You who are wit and grace and playfulness, The glory of the Roman theatre, waking Its tears, its sighs, you who are all the gods And goddesses in one, unknit your brows! You think I scorn your art; but in its name I make appeal, beseeching you to keep In simple accord with those harmonies That lead you know not whither. Oh, believe, I see as in a crystal how you lie Entangled, a mirmillo in a net, I see you helpless in a woman's toils, PYLADES. Then you see true. MARCIA. For the young Empress loves Your beauty to distraction; she will claim Your love as she has claimed the world itself, Will rule your leisure, as a Gorgon freeze Your inborn gifts, and draw you from the stage Where life for you is shrined. By discipline, Frugality that is so hard in youth, You hold your body under absolute And gracious empire: why? That you may give With force and suppleness and soft discretion The images that haunt you. If you yield To Didia Clara, as to Messalina The lovely Mnester yielded his dear art, Then you are hopeless, then you are undone. PYLADES. The lovely Mnester! Why these fatal thoughts? Our Empress has some honour. MARCIA. You have loved, You have been loved again, how many times! Those bonds were light, were broken by a sigh, A fit of weeping or a cruel word: This bond would be of death. PYLADES. How can it matter What any woman feels? I do not swerve. I never loved but once, and that is now, And that is always. Though I am a Greek, And Hermes often makes our lips his own, I cannot tell my love. I hear the songs Of nightingales in spring, the breathless hymns Of those who tread the vats in autumn-time, And still I find no language, but the dance That almost is myself, mute music, one, The sages tell me, with the eloquence Pythagoras enjoyed among the stars That silent met his eyes. I cannot speak My adoration, goddess from strange heavens, As sweet as Ariadne and as clear In majesty as Artemis. MARCIA. Hush, peace! You rend my heart, you open up my shame. I was, what you must never be, the slave Of an imperial lust: and, oh, the death That smothered my young heart, until I learned To love of my own nature that new way You cannot understand! PYLADES. O dÃ¦mons, yes . . . And married your Eclectus. Nothing serves Until one loves and hears the echo back Deep in the soul that one is loved again. I have a great, exasperating love: Marcia, that freedom, would you give it me! MARCIA. I will. I know your secret, prize your love, Return it: I will be your Artemis, Your Ariadne of the stars . . . (repulsing him) Not so, Not so! Ah, I mislead! An Amazon, With breast annulled and freely brandished spear . . . So you have seen me, so I can express My joy in my religion. It is joy To rise each day invincible, as sure As the great sun of glory at the close. I am too bold! Still to the youth of Rome I am the courtesan; where honour is My name can never be. PYLADES. You have forgotten, You surely have forgotten what I am: Enfranchised, and yet subject to the lash Because I give men pleasure openly, Where all can see, applaud, and have their fill. The gold-haired women woo me with their smiles, Their coin, their flatteries, and have their way Or not, 'tis all the same . . . and afterward I dance them as PasiphaÃ« or Byblis Or Cyprian Myrrha, and the judges own My women are seductive. MARCIA. Leda was. Why should you speak so lightly, with a face No longer quite the boy's, you who have suffered And wept and borne the rods? I do not flinch From hurting you; I would not have you fear To suffer; life's great futures come by pain: My God has borne it on His shameful Cross, A malefactor's Cross, and it is fabled That your own god of wine and revelry Was poured as a libation for life's sake, That men might have his joyful benison. If Didia Clara tempt you with her love, Be fearless and be willingâdo not blenchâ Be willing in the last resort to die. PYLADES. To die! Oh, you are mad! What, give this body, That I have made a perfect instrument For gods to play on, to a den of tigers To mangle at their pleasure! You forget I am an artist, and become all creatures On the instant with my art; no influence Can touch me; I put off this Didia Clara, When I am weary, as I loose a mask: But you, you have the very Pylades You waked an hour ago; I am your lover When I am just myself. MARCIA. Then promise me, Rather than be her minion you will die. PYLADES. So that is all your love! While you are happy With your Eclectus, you would have me promise That I will leave the pleasant light because You grudge your rival even one golden hour. No, Marcia! Ease my senses, let me be Your very lover, and no other woman Shall touch my lips, shall ever fire my thoughts. You will not . . . ? I shall be more merciful. If Didia Clara languish for my love I shall not let her die. It is forbidden Of all the gods mortals should die of love: Soon as they hear a maiden's secret sigh In any grove, they mingle with the trees, They part the rushes . . . (Re-enter Clara.) Exquisitely fair! I greet my Empress. CLARA. Pylades awake! Did Marcia rouse you? I had given command None should disturb your rest. I had the thought Of waking you myself. PYLADES. You are resplendent. So bright an apparition . . . and this scarf The purple of your roses! CLARA. Marcia, go; My mother is uncertain what to wear Befitting her new honours. You have been Almost an Empress; you can counsel her How she should wear her ornaments. (Clara is before a mirror, still arranging her purple folds of drapery.) This laugh! Who laughed? MARCIA. Not I! Poor lady, I despise So utterly the things she holds of worth: But I will be her servant. (Exit.) CLARA. Then you laughed! You must not. PYLADES. An imperial decree! CLARA. Is it a gauze that I have chosen wrong, A jewel set awry? Where is the fault? Mine are the finest shoulders in all Rome For Berenice's pearls, and yet you laugh, You mock me . . . and that woman! Oh, I dreamedâ PYLADES. And Marcia stopped the dreaming? By the gods, We will dream on. Come, whisper in my ear, As if it were a secret, what you dreamed. CLARA. You looked so beautiful Lying asleep, and when the messenger Saluted me I thought how I would bend Above you like Fortuna with her helm. I fixed the gems to break upon your eyes As glory from Olympus. When I came My mortal was not sleeping. PYLADES. But the gems! Fair goddess, there is welcome in my eyes At any hour for beauty. And this opal . . . CLARA. You see, it is a hazel-nut in size. PYLADES. A world of sky in variance. CLARA. An estate In price. You touch the beryls: they are fair. PYLADES. Deep-sea-like in their strangeness. CLARA. And neglect My emeralds, these from the mines of Egypt, These from the Ural mines. And look! my robe! The finest wool of Po, the deepest purple Of Tyrian murex; owned by Commodus, A thousand deniers bought it, and perchance It once was worn by Marcia. But you find That I am fresh in beauty, with the right To make old splendours new. Why do you tremble? PYLADES. At life, at all these changes of attire, And everything to pass from us, the praise, And all the glory. CLARA. Yet you are not thrilled That the great moment of my life is come; That has no meaning. In an instant, think, I stretch my hands for all that earth can give, Nothing denied me. PYLADES. You are eloquent. A glorious gesture! It will serve my turn For Midas praying from his bower of roses To Dionysus for the golden touch. CLARA. O despicable! so you use your friends To help you in your art. You never feel Giddy and sick and drunken all at once; You only represent, you do not suffer. PYLADES. Oh yes, I suffer like the rest, be sure; More, more acutely: so much from revolt At all that I must suffer in my eyes, My hearing, my whole soul. But in my sorrow There is no barren pain; all comes to birth, All ends in triumph. Every tragedy Ends so, in fuller wine-cups at the feast, More music, wilder dances! CLARA. Pylades, I turn to you, I am so mere a girl: Do not grow stony and disdainful; think How mere a girl I am, how great it seems To compass all the world. I tell you first, For these wild, sweeping dreams would murder me If no one felt their greatness. You are young, And I have often heard you say how wicked It is not to have joy enough to enter Into another's joy. PYLADES. O horrible! CLARA. Then stay beside me: there is little time; At any moment we may be surprised . . . O Pylades, I love you. I should die Were you to leave me here with all this clinging And hideous wealthâno rapture; for the world Is only mine through you. PYLADES. And what the price For this last bauble? You must bribe me high. CLARA. I own you, I exact you. PYLADES. But the sum? I have rejected many noble ladies Too poor to tempt me. CLARA. I will tax the earth Until it groans: all that you covet, all Is instantly your own. Ah, now you smile Believing; a new look of happiness Passes across your beauty. PYLADES. I consent To be beloved. CLARA. My idol! PYLADES. So it is! If we but have our idol, Fortune's shears May snip just where they choose. Now you will pass Gay-hearted to the Regia? CLARA. I shall load you With every honour: you shall be a Knight, And I myself will give the golden ring That makes you noble. Let my father wed His daughter to a monarchâyou, my lover, Will have more regal sway. Gods! you will laugh When those who saw you beaten . . . how my blood Dries up within me when I think of it! . . . Shall watch you as you triumph, as you rule The hopes of king and senator. PYLADES. How good! Then I shall have revenge. CLARA. There will be banquets Nobler than those of Commodus; our guests Will whisper the imagined cost of all We heap upon the tables, whisper how The least thing in my wardrobe must have travelled Across the world to me: and I shall shine One glow of jewels; every eye will follow, Not only yours, all eyes. . . . PYLADES. Until I dance; Then in a moment you will be extinct, You and your gems and boasting. CLARA. You must live For my applause. PYLADES. You love to see me dance? CLARA. O Pylades, I only love too well The mazes of your dance, the way your hair Lifts with the impulse of a leap and falls. I feel the plaudits as I feel my heart, They throb together through me, and I long To rear as statues for enduring time Each image of you as it comes and goes; I long to see it cold: and that shall be; You shall have fame for ever, marble statues In Rome, throughout the land; but you are mine, And I can never let you dance again. PYLADES. Not at the feasts? CLARA. Never, at any time. PYLADES. Not at the theatre? CLARA. Pylades, my lover, You can imagine I will let you traffic Upon the public boards; you dream a Knight Can ply such shameful art and prostitute The honours I confer; that I could watch While you were dancing to the general crowd You worship with your body . . . PYLADES. Earth and light! You think that I am dancing to the crowd When the great clamour rises! (He starts away from her.) CLARA. You are gone, You flee from me; you must not go. I cling As a mere suppliant. You shall have your art, Shall dance at any feast . . . I will not heed, I will not seem to watch you . . . if in secret, If sometime you will let me be beloved Even as your imaged Leda. PYLADES. I will die, For I have played that part how many times, Died to my god in ecstasyâActÃ¦on Torn by the hounds, or Orpheus on the stream, Still faithful to Eurydice, and calling And looking after her amid the howls Of women he rejected! Oh, the bliss! CLARA. Is Marcia in the palace? Is she gone? I need some help. . . . Will you not summon her? For if you speak of death, that is an action We all can play. . . . There is the poison-bowl, And I have courage. (Re-enter Manlia and Marcia.) PYLADES. Marcia . . . Oh, your mother, See, she is coming full of pride in you. Be comforted. MANLIA. My dearest! CLARA. I am ill. Marcia, there is a phial in my room, Close to my little bronze of Mercury. Fetch it, and . . . (Exit Marcia on the right, while a Tribune enters on the left.) Lo, a Tribune at the door! Then I can claim obedience. Slay that man; He has insulted me. TRIBUNE. But I am sent Expressly at the Emperor's strict command To fetch him to the banquet: while to you, Most honoured ladies, I have brought the message That Didius Julianus begs your presence To-morrow at the Regia. CLARA. Do you challenge My first command? (Re-enter Marcia.) TRIBUNE. O pardon, dread Augusta, I must obey the Emperor; but your wishes Will be your father's nod. PYLADES. It does not matter; What should this matter now, or anything? (Meeting Marcia's eyes.) I have not failed. And I shall dance to-night. So, to the Regia, on! (He follows the Tribune: Clara fixes her gaze suspiciously on Marcia, snatches the phial from her and breaks it on the ground, with a ringing laugh.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. (A Triclinium of the Regia: twilight; the moon is seen through the columns, with three large stars near her. In the chamber a small table is set for a meal, and behind it lies a dark, sinister-looking heap. Shouts are heard, and the flare of torches is cast forward into the chamber: then Didius, LÃ¦tus, Eclectus, Abascantus, and the PrÃ¦torian Guards enter boisterously, followed by the Slaves of the Imperial Household. DIDIUS. I would relate my parts and qualities, But that you know them, but that you have tested Their pith in many offices. LÃTUS. Augustus, Your actions are not worth a thought to those Who know what golden honour you possess. Others be consuls, generals, if they will; You only have the Power between your hands To buy the Roman Empireâgold for Earth, Gold for the subjects you have made your slaves. Your credit is your truest coronation, Your wealth your glory, and our hopes your safeguard From menace of your certain enemies. ABASCANTUS. A thousand drachms apiece! You have a master Who shows no stint in his extravagance. The Age of Gold is back again. LÃTUS. O Saturn, We worship you and set you in this temple, Whence you will shine down drachms on us, on all, As yonder moon shines moonbeams. ECLECTUS. Do not vaunt The surety of your fortune to the moon. DIDIUS. How white her glow swells through the shadiness! Each flashing torch is overcast, and now Dark objects seem to form and meet my eyes. That table . . . ECLECTUS. It was spread for Pertinax. DIDIUS. A little table that Philemon's self Might sit at after delving. But you jest; It is impossible. For Pertinax This single loaf, this scanty plate of figs, This wine! . . . My thirst is grievous; I must drink Whate'er the vintage. Pah! the stuff is sour As blood upon my tongue! A dismal banquet, A palace like a vault! What holds the moon? She hovers like a Harpy o'er the meal. What passes in the chamber? Ghosts and spirits, This is no supper for a deity. (to the Slaves.) Take the stale food away, illume the hall With burning candelabra; let a banquet Perfume and warm the air: Ambracian goat, A dish of peacock-brains, the Spanish hare And African pintado; citrons, peaches, And Lusitanian cherries. Fetch my cooks, Search everywhere for dainties: tho' tis late, We look for entertainment. As a host I am well seasoned, and I do not fear Comparison with . . . (Exeunt Slaves.) LÃTUS Fling the table down, And tilt its contents in the cornerârefuse Of vile frugality. DIDIUS. The meal prepared, He did not touch . . . Such violent overthrow Is like a clap. Be gentle, and remember He was our predecessor. LÃTUS. But your pattern In nothing. Commodus would be for you A safer paradigm. ABASCANTUS. We shall not need To emulate the past. DIDIUS. And who is this? The moon's Endymion, some young boy asleep? No, the small body has a withered hand. Ye gods of death and Hades! There, look there! And the moon, pointing like a finger down, Shows blood upon the floor. It cannot be . . . LÃTUS. Why not? It is the trunk of Pertinax Left where it bled. I wonder that the slaves Ere this have not removed it. ECLECTUS. Do you wonder? Their master's headless trunk? It looks a thing Not to be meddled with. DIDIUS. It must be moved, It must; call in his slaves. I could have borne The image of his slaughter haunting me As if it were some tragedy, some dark And inbreathed fable; but to see like this Before my eyes, before my very feet, The robe, these hands, the sheerness of the robe Where once . . . to see it all! In Tartarus There is no matching horror. Take it hence! (Soldiers lay hands on the corse.) ECLECTUS. Nay, softly! He was good; by Isis, just; And in the balance of the mighty gods To be approved now dead. DIDIUS. With burial rites Of cost and splendour I will honour him. But hear me! In the moon's unspotted light, Before the judging Powers, I have no fault, I did no wrong; I am no heir of his. O horrible! My mind is in a whirl, For I was waiting a few hours ago, Like him, for supper . . . and I take his place, And swerve from contemplation of his corse As if I were his murderer. Assist me! Do not stand silent by! As honest men Proclaim my innocence; for all the gods, I feel, are unconvinced. You, LÃ¦tus, say, Who was it brought the news? Let every actor Fill in the story: I am ignorant, Though I have bought his empire, wear his crown. LÃTUS. Yes, when your gold is measured out to us. DIDIUS. Why did you murder him? LÃTUS. Must you complain? Come, Emperor, come! We did it for your sake, And look for our reward. This man we slew Was to his guards a tyrant; life was shorn Of every ease, and Venus was divorced From Mars by yonder Censor. You have wisdom To feast and let us feast. ABASCANTUS. Upon the seas Our vessels ride, home-pointed, with their freight Of treasure and of delicacies richer To palate than is treasure to the hand; Also with slaves from Paphos. Lift the corse! Black, starving winter must be cast away When the free year pours bounty. Take it hence. LÃTUS. To yonder private chamber of the baths, That only can be entered by this door. 'Tis safer so; for no one must have sight, I tell you, of the headless miser, no one Must mourn him in the street. You hear those cries? Curses, not pÃ¦ans . . . but he does not hear! All sense is in his eyes; look how they follow The exit of the body. (Didius watches the procession to the bath-room: Eclectus quietly steps aside and looks out.) DIDIUS. (suddenly turning round.) Now at last The stillness has no centre, and at last The shining clouds have no reproachfulness. My heart takes up its pulses, and I breathe With no locked struggle more. Let myrrh be poured, Embalming the blue moonlight, and let youths Deep-scatter Eastern rose-leaves. Congregate More torches, draw me in a golden table, If these impoverished halls can furnish such, And, treasurer, my best Setinian! Hence, Unlock my noblest wines. (Exit Abascantus.) (More Slaves of the Imperial Household enter and begin to prepare the feast.) How soberly Eclectus watches. Is there in the heavens Some fixedness that may not be impaired; Or can he outline the great polity We learn by shocks of chance? Say, good Eclectus, What stirs among the fates? Those vivid stars Heave round the moon their strange, insurgent glory. Are they not planets? ECLECTUS. Ask what they portend; They are not of small presage. DIDIUS. They foreshadow . . . ? ECLECTUS. Calamity from north, and west, and east. Observe! This fiery triangle, three stars Form round the fluctuant moon, is nothing else Than danger from Albinus and his host In Britain, danger from the Syrian troops That Niger leads, and danger from the army Severus in Illyria makes his own: The last the nearer hazard. DIDIUS. This is kindly; You wish to give me warning that I stand Too sheer upon a brink. It is my hope Rather to win Albinus, to persuade Severus . . . ECLECTUS. There are currents in the stars No mortal may arrest. DIDIUS. Hot superstition! A man may watch a battle from a hill, May speculate and augur: so the gods Look down on our encounters, laugh and bet, But leave Fortuna to confer the crown. You did not apprehend for Pertinax His sudden overthrowâa righteous man Unrighteously rewarded! So to Chance We for the future will confide ourselves. Soon we shall sup, and in the ruddy wine Forget disaster. ECLECTUS. I need scarcely say The Emperor sups alone. DIDIUS. But will the slaves Obey me on the instant? LÃTUS. Give your orders; Death corrects inattention. DIDIUS. And my wife And daughter? LÃTUS. We are soldiers; when you need Our service, we are ready. For to-night We leave you in repose. DIDIUS; But Commodus Had merry-making suppers. ECLECTUS. Peace! A body Still lies unsepulchred beneath your roof. LÃTUS. The people, too, are hostile; with their shouts And clashing arms they fill the hippodrome: We must be watchful, and our master wise. Sit down and sup as Pertinax, although With self-delighting elegance. To-morrow Feasts shall be high, and we on purple thrones Will laugh at dawn, and pledge the ruddy sun With ruddier Bacchus. I will set the guard That shall protect your sleep. (Exeunt all but Didius and the Slaves of the Imperial Household.) DIDIUS. An empty palace, And all the slaves are slinking one by one Out of the blood-stained room. They shall not go. Back with you, traitors! A SLAVE. What is your command? What would you have us do? DIDIUS. Why, everything Just as before. SLAVE. The Emperor supped alone. DIDIUS. I know; but it is singular and dreary In this resounding hall. I am fatigued, I . . . Do not stand about me with wide eyes And laggard feet, and spirits further off Than I could banish, further than the dead. A numbness closes round me like a cloud. Can you not speak, and proffer me some service? (Apart.) I stand here central, and my echoing voice Peals through a monument, with ghostly symbols That harrow me. Give me some smiles, some glances, Some pleasantry to play away the time. Have you no tumblers, harpists? (A Slave points to the bath-room.) Oh, of course, There must not be much noise: but Pylades, The Pantomime, I sent to bid him come; And, since we would subdue festivity, His orchestra and chorus shall be grouped Behind yon purple curtain at the door, Within the Atrium, where, for once concealed, The voices and the reeds shall softly sound Together, while before us the quick limbs Rehearse some gay and celebrated scene: That is our will. And let the chamberlain Visit my house and tell my family My mind is altered, and I pray them come With their best speed at once. Make preparations That they may sleep in comfort. (Exeunt some of the Slaves.) When I see My Clara's exultation, I shall soon Be merry, and forget the triad there, Riddling my brain with arrows as they flash; Forget the people in the hippodrome, Whose shouts are not of friendship, and forget That heap, the moonlight . . . and these rows of mutes, The glittering, fixed eyes that pass a comment On every little motion that I make. Wise Pertinax to sup alone! (To Slaves) Begone! (Exeunt.) (Some moments of waiting silence.) And now there is not any, the least noise Within; but now I must bow down and hear The cries of execration in the street, The soldiers' drowning plaudits, the acclaim. Does the world echo? For I hear a blast Prolonged, afar, a hollow trumpet-call, To which a herald shouts âCaligula,â Then smoothing silence; and again the call And shout of âClaudius, Nero, Galba,âânames Of every murdered Emperor . . . âCommodus,â And lastly âPertinax;â while after him Silence lies hungry. (The stillness is broken by fiercer cries from the hippodrome.) Can there be such rage? Such harassing, fanged, ravenous, wild hatred, And no escape from all this loneliness And furious consternation? Double horror Of phantasms and of the deep-mouthed crowd! I can but pace and pace, and wish that thunder Would shake that stony moonlight from the room, Or wish that I were buried . . . (pausing by an archaic sacrophagus) Ay as there, Deep in a basalt tomb, with consciousness The weight of ages would hold down the lid Through many thousand years. To be forgotten, To mingle with impenetrable sand, That is to be a king. My throat is dry; There is a taste like brass upon my tongue, A nausea, a discouragement . . . Again The soldiers' clamour swells, again âAugustusâ Rings in my ears, with noble epithets, âMagnificent, divine.â If Rome would love me, Or even would flatter, hail me as a god! Ay, but the gods have never mounted thrones, At least with human witness; if they had, They would have felt like strangers. (Flutes are heard outside: Pylades enters.) Pylades, Tricked out as Bacchus, with his noble fruit, Gilt greaves and Tyrian mantle! Now he breaks The lovely silence of his vocal limbs, Wreathing his body to the flutes. Divine! Juno would rise and call this boy her son If in Olympus he should move like this. (Voices sing to the flutes while Pylades rhythmically interprets the Canticum.) CHORUS. Every stream that hides in rock, Heart of wood or udder soft, With repletion gurgles, flows Down the hillside, down the plain: Grape-sap, nectar of the bees, Flame from stones, a surge of milk Follow, running, where I tread. (Between each strophe the flutes play on, unaccompanied by the voices, and Pylades executes a dithyrambic dance.) Then there is a clustering sound Underneath the clustered leaves; And the woodland creatures spring Sudden from their deep retreat: Tigers with loud boom descend, Swift and yellow, And mute-footed; Panthers, teasing, speckled, gracious; And the troops of hoof-foot satyrs, Free at last from fear and cunning, Free from shadow, free from silence, Snakes in coils about their horns, And the wild-vine round their fleeces. Old Silenus follows after, Pricking each long ear for secrets Told by brook and hill and woodland, As he passes on his beast, Hung with fir-cones of the forest, And the wreaths that twine in shade. Through the cities next I pass, And the silent houses waken; Footsteps beat the marble threshold, And the breezes swell round bosoms Bare and heaving with a candour Once inviolableânow Yielded to the sun and breeze. Women gather, maids or wedded, Rushing forth from old seclusion, Free as showers of April rain, Through the valleys, through the pine-stems, Singing, dancing for their pleasure, Not for pleasure of another, But because their breath is singing, And their feet the dance itself. Mine a glory drawn from covert By the rapture of my spells, Drawn from under dale and mountain, From recesses of the city, From recesses of the wood. By my power the caves of ice In the old man's heart are rivenâ Then his crutch becomes his thyrsus, Then his silver locks are serpents Tossing in a spring-tide wreath. We are revellers, for revel Strikes the sky from our array; We are revellers, the ground Shakes behind us, red with leas, Strewn with foliage and the shreds Of the rended flock and herd. We are just a feast to look on; We are terrible to knowâ Every withy hides a spear-point; Every voice rails high, and Pan, Leader of our dread parade, Blowing from his pipe, defeats Courage in a mortal's blood. (As Pylades is dancing, the howls from the hippodrome become wilder, and Didius rises anxiously. He paces to and fro, his foot slips on the blood of Pertinax; he shrieks. Pylades, forgetting his part, drops his thyrsus, leaps to the Emperor's side, and clings to him, while the flutes play on.) PYLADES (taking off his mask.) O Emperor, what has thrilled you? For I felt How cold you were to everything I did. Ye gods, the room is cold; some influence presses As snow up round me, weighs upon my limbs, And makes the chaunt I render yawn between Myself and inspiration like a blank. I have grown powerless and I hear you cry. What is it? DIDIUS. Boy, my Bacchus, it is blood; I glided on the blood of Pertinax And almost fell. Why did you play this part? Why let your dithyrambus turn my palace Into an underground and echoing tomb? I quail with fear, the chamber is so full Of that dread song of life and of the curses With which the Romans keep the night alive; And all this while a corpse is growing stiff Behind that door, a corpse. PYLADES. Does CÃ¦sar mean There is a body near us, out of sight? DIDIUS. Yes, there. PYLADES. Whose body? DIDIUS. That of Pertinax. It menances my future. PYLADES. Vail your eyes! We must not look behind the screen, not there, Not anywhere; we must not front the fates, But let them sing to us. Again the song! CHORUS. March! Let fly your jests like arrows, Slay with laughter, Slay with hatred, With the tongue and with the voice. March! Our pleasure is a passion Keen to strive and keen to conquer, While audacious to enjoy. India, ho!âthe world before us! All the plains and timeless deserts That are African and Asian, All the meadows of the West, And the steeps of Italy. (Flutes alone.) PYLADES. Why did you stop the dancing? I am lost; It all goes by, the unarrested splendour, The music of the pipes, the ruthless voices, And I am outcast. DIDIUS. Then you feel it too? I hear your heart, I hear it beat on mine With terror, not an equal wretchedness. Those howls outside are hungry but for me; Those stars are bubbling with a fiery haste To ruin me; these rose-leaves will not check The sliding of my feet. I am pursued; I feel the victim's shiver through my limbs: The gods are injured and the majesty Of Rome cries from the ground, while I am here Bewildered, innocent. PYLADES. The clamour falls, And the great melody goes surging on That I have never heard before: the tune! CHORUS. I have passed one lonesome figure By the surf-edge of the ocean, With a salt and sterile drearness In the eyes that gaze to sea: But, unprompted, flashing forward As no wing of bird can flash, I am near her, I have called her, And her lips breathe toward my breathing, And the light from off her face Is the glow of my own triumph, As I draw the love within her Out from modesty to truth. Now my spells have wrought a kingdom, Now is Ariadne crowned; Side by side, above the tigers, Side by side and gaze on gaze; Forth we press, our powers behind us, We the bounteous, we who live. (Flutes alone.) PYLADES. You heard? That faultless marriageâlove in love Lost deep in sempiternity; the rapture Of god and woman as the music raved, And the voice swelled the music's resonance. While I am here, beside you, and aloof From all the force, the melody, the passion That I am born to move to . . . nothing mine, Save, Emperor, death. DIDIUS. I do not understand. But such as you are prescient in their moods And speak enigmas. What of that? You cling With flesh that beats on mine; you are to me More than a desert empire, precious boy: For while you fill my arms I am not lost In fatal strangeness that presages death Before one dies; and when I hear you speak I realise my execrating people Are in the hippodrome, not with me here; I see the undrowned lustre of that star, And know Severus has not heard the news That I have bought the world, that Pertinax Is dead. I am not as a madman tethered To my own nature's plague, shut up with self And my clawed heart-strings. You deliver me, You give me conciousness, and in return I love you with a wasteful gratitude, A fulness in a moment, years of warmth Poured out, not to your beauty, your wide hair And supple limbsâno, not to them, but you, A god become a mortal, serving me, Keeping me living by the awful zest With which he shares my agony: more close Than any creature of my flesh and blood Can ever be.âSalvator! While I hold you Safe in my clasp my hands enfold the world, And I too hear the musicâhow it cries! CHORUS. Evoe! Hark the word that rouses Tigers' fierceness, Women's madness, Cheers and jubilee of satyrs, Execration in our foes, Turbulent felicity In our ranks and in our hearts. Evoe!âfor the earth is waking, As the sun can never wake it; As alone victorious passage Of its life-blood into living Can arouse and fire its kingdoms. Evoe! Frantic beat the cymbals, Satyrs, beat your little drums! Down with impetus of dances, Down on India, with your serpents, With your wine-cups and the garlands Round your weapons and your brows. Overwhelm the world with singing, Light it with one flow of torches, Laugh across it, clang against itâ Evoe!âfor the world is ours! (The Flutes cease.) PYLADES. And yet to die . . . To go from all that warms the pulse, to wander Naked and fasting through the asphodels . . . (He weeps.) DIDIUS. Nay, hush! We must not think: your dithyramb Would kill all evil thinking, and the leaves And grapes of your vine-garland, Bacchus mine, Forbid your brain to toil. Resume the mask! It is your pledge of life. We must not die: You cannot, my young god; all gods endure. (Enter Manlia and Didia Clara. Pylades hastily puts on his mask.) CLARA. Father! DIDIUS. Augusta, lady of the world, My child . . . and you, dear wife, Augusta too: The Senate has acclaimed you. MANLIA. Jupiter Be praised, and Plutus! DIDIUS. I have bought the gift Unequalled, for your love's sake. Kiss me, child. CLARA. Not while your arm is round that pantomime, The wheedling sycophant, who hides his shame With a god's visage. Throw him to the ground, And let your slaves despatch him. DIDIUS. Pylades? Why should the lad be doomed? What causeâwhat proof? . . . CLARA. I give no reason but my will: unproved, Or proved his crime, he dies; for in the scope Of the great honour I receive from Rome, I have a sovereign power of life and death That he shall feel, unless it is a dream, A hollow title that you flout me with. The world is nothing to me, while he breathes Defiantly within it, poisoning, Dimming my triumph. Slay him! DIDIUS. What, you greet me With this, âThe world is nothing,â when for you I have poured out my riches, and for you Endangered life and peace? Behind that door Lies Pertinax beheaded, and outside The people rage, while in this lonely dwelling I have outbraved extremity: and yet You say, âThe world is nothing.â By the gods, You are as hungry as the mouth of Dis. The world is nothing, madam? CLARA. While he lives. DIDIUS. But you have never thanked me, have not sighed One zephyr of heart's-ease nor let a smile Pay my profuseness lavishly. Naught, naught! When I have almost equalled deity In my munificence. MANLIA. Control yourself, Dear husband; you are now a governor. CLARA. By Vesta, he insulted me. DIDIUS. And you Insult my very fatherhood, insult My sickened hope to please you. When I bid The hundred drachms beyond Sulpicianus, I saw your joy like sun upon my gold; That vision was my crown. Away, away! I have no more for you; I have no more. Hence! I have risked life, treasure, peace of mind, To give you what is valueless. Away! MANLIA. Her father, you will surely hear her speak Of wrong that wounds her pride. DIDIUS. I will not hear. Have I not heard her say the world is nothing? And yet an hour ago it was the aim Of all desire, for which I spent myself. You both are more like images than women, Cold as if everything I did, my labour, My pain, the anxious horror of to-night, The sacrifice of a whole treasury, Were piled in front of stone. And now you ask The only life that through my solitude Came close to me with love, that forced the hours Affrighting me like monstrous births of Time Back to their human stamp. You say . . . but then Why should I listen further to your lies? You said the world was all that you desired, You say the world is nothing, and you say My Pylades insulted you. By heaven, You bear false witness, that your jealousy May seize an instant victim! I am judge; And when man's life is in debate, 'tis vain To bid me hasten judgment. CLARA. Do you call That sorry creature man? DIDIUS. How well I see Your accusation is a perjurer's, No justice in its accentânone! (to Pylades.) Stand forth, And lift that mask from off your countenance. Have you offended as she charges you? PYLADES. I have not; she mistakes. I played a part That she demanded, and she took it ill: Sometimes we pantomimes are punished thus By slow-conceiving patrons. All the blame Lies in the certainty I did not please. DIDIUS. Not pleaseâah, there I have it! Give your life To this voracious Harpyâno! (To Clara.) Your suit, Augusta, is rejected. CLARA. Infamous! Outrage from you, my father, you . . . the protest Of venal lips preferred before my oath! And you can suffer those still eyes to stare In a rapt wonder at me, nor remove At once their watching from my memory. Mother, you stay or go, but I return Home from a palace where my will is mocked, My word claims no belief, my natural place Is filled by yonder god of paint and lawn My sire is pleased to cherish as a son. Augustus, I, like you, disown our bond: You have no daughter, and my love is hate. (to Pylades.) Almighty minion, you may grant your favours Or hold them back: I am not in their sphere. Vale, my lords! (Exit.) MANLIA. Fortuna, you allow Your child to leave you thus? For honour's sake And empire's dignity, remove protection From your dishonoured favourite! Do not place One who was born a slave, and practises An execrable art, before the offspring I bore you, I, your Empress and the woman You have entitled Juno. On my life, Husband, I think the fever of to-day Disorders you: you take a dancer's word Against your daughter's, will not wash a stain From her proud modesty in servile blood. You glare upon me so, my shattered strength Will need physician's soothing, ere I sleep. Are you Lycurgus? will you slay your child To please this Bacchus? You have slain her love. It is a sin extravagant and cruel That you commit against her in your rage. DIDIUS. Then follow her. MANLIA. To bring her back? I will. DIDIUS. I'd rather look upon a parricide; Go, if you love the sight. MANLIA. What, of my child? I do; and I retire, with prayers to heaven The husband and the father may be changed To his old likeness and serenity. Our daughter must be soothed at home. Farewell! . . . (The Slaves of Didius' household enter with amphorÃ¦.) Restrain yourself in wine: you sent the keys For your Setinian. Be persuaded, drink, But yet with moderation, for your forehead Is flushed and heavy, and that boy will tempt. Our reign has opened sombrely. I go. (Exit.) DIDIUS. Or I shall strike you. Clara! she has left My palace daughterless, and now her mother Forgets she is my wife. Where are they gone? Or have they ever been the human creatures I fostered as my soul? Are they not idols, Mere idols, with no comradeship to offer, And with no spring of thanks to feed the time We ruin for their sakes? O Didia Clara! Was that her nameâmy ownâand to be set So proudly on the medals? (to Pylades.) Women, death! We will forget them. See, the feast is spread, The roses are ensanguined by the lamps, And the wine waits to give them drenching baths Of darker glory. Evoe, Pylades! Although these women toss the world away That I have bought, does that disown the fact That I have bought it? It is mine, my own, Mine to enjoy to-night, and while the fates Yield me these marble halls for such a feast, You for companion. Drink, my Pylades! (Pylades, seizing the wine-cup, drains it.) PYLADES. O Bacchus, to oblivion! For we die, We liveâno matterâwhile the chorus swells Behind us and beyond, with dedication Of future after future in the past; Spring, and then spring through years that dim all count; Cycles of races, laughter, joys on joys, And joy-enkindling pains. I lift the crater; Drain it yourself: it gives the warranty Of endless life, our own forgotten. Drink! DIDIUS (drinking.) Two centuries have sealed it for this hour. Quaff it again, my conqueror of death, And dip that flagging vine. (Pylades steeps his wreath &amp; drinks again.) Your golden tresses Rust with Setinian stains. (Shouting.) More music, heigh! Again the wild close of the dithyramb. (The Flutes sound.) PYLADES. And I to make it rush across your sight, As voice and music bear it to your ears. I practise the divinest mystery; Co-equal with creation, it was born, As love, in oldest days: our holy Mother Of all things, Rhea, watches silently With smiles the dance; it saved the life of Zeus Through Corybantic homage, and the god Who lives in me to-night, through dancing tamed The Indians, the Tyrrhenians, and the folk Of Lydiaâsavage peoples. By the stars, I will subdue the curse of Pertinax! (He catches up his mask and the thyrsus he had dropped at the moment of panic, sweeps aside the curtain and invites his hidden orchestra and chorus to enter. They group themselves behind him and recommence singing and playing to his dance.) CHORUS. Evoe! Hark, the word that rouses Tigers' fierceness, Women's madness, Cheers and jubilee of satyrs, Execration in our foes, Turbulent felicity In our ranks and in our hearts. Evoe!âfor the earth is waking As the sun can never wake it, As alone victorious passage Of its life-blood into living Can arouse and fire its kingdoms. Evoe! Frantic beat the cymbals. Satyrs, beat your little drums; Down with impetus of dances, Down on India with your serpents, With your wine-cups and the garlands Round your weapons and your brows. Overwhelm the world with singing, Light it with one flow of torches, Laugh across it, clang against it, Evoe!âfor the world is ours. (After a wild dithyrambic dance, he waves the flutists and singers away.) DIDIUS. You only live by movement. Ah, what curves Of the supple lawn, now spread as wings, and now As hollow as the chalice of a flower, And you half-seen among them, apparition Of deity belonging to the air. Your dancing as the rod of Mercury Could waken all that sleep. It is a pleasure Like music or like love. Wise hands, wise feet, That can persuade so well! If I could join The kingdom of your dithyramb, I think All craving would be filled. Delicious boy, I give you perfect praise; for if the god You dance were present, he as in a glass Would find his acts, his motions. I can scarcely Contain my heart at what your body pictures, An empire that is life and will and blessing, That taunts my gold, my fear, and draws me on To leave regret and memories behind. But you have fallen quivering and draped In the damp veils that cling upon your form. Come, let us banquet: rest these perfect limbs Along the cushions. . . What, you will not eat? PYLADES (unmasked.) I am too much of fire to feed that way: Your praise, the wine, the beautyâah, the beauty For which I live, alone can entertain My appetite this evening. (Gabba suddenly lifts himself from an obscure corner near the bath-room.) GABBA. But my supper! I have not eaten since the early dawn. You promised me my supper. DIDIUS. Ah! my dwarf, You here! Back to your mistress; she will teach you To grin with your scant face. GABBA. I am at home. Do not dismiss me as a beggar. I Can lead you on from empty room to room, Till they become familiar, for I know The palace inch by inchâits murdered masters, Its murdered masters! I have seen before A stain like this, a runlet from the ground. This was my corner by the Emperor's chair. Now lift me up. DIDIUS. Look at him, Pylades. Why should I lift you? Climb! PYLADES. Give him a crater, And we will have him drunk too in a trice, And hiccuping success. GABBA. I can lap blood Here on the floor. DIDIUS. Tush! I will lift you up, And drop the rosy garland in your bowl: Now you can drink the flowers. GABBA. You are afraid: You spill the wine. DIDIUS. Why do you grovel there, You wart, you fungus? (He kicks Gabba.) GABBA. Blood upon your heel! DIDIUS. Quick, Pylades, remove him! (Gabba is caught by Pylades and thrown out of the room: one thin groan is heard.) And this feast! I cannot touch it. So I pushed away My wife, my childâand it is time to sleep: Even the hippodrome is quiet now. . . . (Pylades returns.) I cannot sleep alone. Say, Pylades, Poor lad, are you not weary? PYLADES. Wine, more wine! (He falls across the couch at Didius' feet, a drunken Bacchus.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. (The same Hall of the Regia, little more that two months later. Didius is pacing restlessly.) DIDIUS. I cannot sleep. I hate this solitude Of dawn: I must have audience. . . . Didia Clara, She was the first to comeâfor gifts, for gifts, Those early morning gifts! Would she were dead; Then I could build a temple over her. I can do nothing . . . for I love her foe; I will not have him slain. . . . It may be hours Before the file of formal visitors From army and from Senate. O the ghosts! If I could doze a little. (Enter Marcia.) Marcia here? A friend.âWhat tidings? MARCIA. It is not yet dawn. O Emperor, you must sleep. DIDIUS. You have not slept. MARCIA. I have been with Eclectus, with the stars. DIDIUS. The stars are for us? MARCIA. They burn bright on Rome. Be comforted. But you must rest a little Again before the dawn. DIDIUS. You think I may? MARCIA. Nothing remains to do. This sleep you crave Is the gods' instant gift. DIDIUS. You will not watch? Not longer? Rome is safe. MARCIA. I shall go forth With praise and votive offering . . . to my God. (Exit.) (Didius stretches himself on a couch.) DIDIUS. How steadily she soothes me! For nine weeks I have been here, a prisoner and a guest; Even these purple curtains in my hands Have never seemed my own: I noted them Admiringly, as something of a host's That I must take the pattern of. Nine weeks, In comfortless seclusion, I have felt Rome's awful silence of hostility. 'Twas not by signs in every sacrifice, Nor by the flight of inauspicious birds Across the sky, nor by the balefulness That haunts this palace of slain Pertinax, No, not by these I was tormented most: But by death's very presence in the streets, As if I were alone upon my way With pestilence all round me. It was Rome I trembled at . . . as if my proper shadow Contorted threw strange shapes before my feet. Rome, I had bought her, and the oracles Were dumb, the streets were deathlike. But at last The stars themselves show favour to my rule, And Marcia says nothing remains to do, My empire is securely mine. How vile The colour of this broideryâCommodus Had but a vulgar pride! I shall embellish These halls, divinely filling in my dreams . . . My dreamsâI grow confused. (He closes his eyes.) Are those the columns Of the new atrium? Do they stretch so far? No matter!âWe must drag them up the steep Whatever be the labour! I must try To set them in their stations and to count . . . Innumerous, strange statues . . . (He sleeps.) (After a few moments, enter Eclectus.) ECLECTUS. He is doomed, Severus near the gates, the people cold. Pity to wake him! Yet a Chamberlain Must do his office. (Rousing Didius.) It is morning, Sire. DIDIUS. How gaunt your visage! You were with the starsâ ECLECTUS. The stars are faded; we have done with fate Soon as the daylight springs; each mortal then Is left to stumble on his way. DIDIUS. The city Is in the gods' protection. ECLECTUS. While Severus Gathers his host more thickly on the verge. O Emperor, you must combat destiny As best you can. The PrÃ¦fect craves admission. DIDIUS. Summon the PrÃ¦fect. (Exit Eclectus.) I will take my toga, And face this apparition on the verge. (Didius wraps his toga about him, and looks out over the city.) How still it is, and in the dawn how white And clear! It cannot be an enemy Is marching to the gates. There is a stir About the clouds to northward, but the birds Fly easily, and do not congregate Or cry as they are wont before a storm. I have not looked down on my Rome before Like this at daybreak, have not seen her laid Tempting and iridescent at my feet, With the sun's finger on the Capitol, Gilding the roofs. I would pay more for her, For all this majesty, payâbut to whom? Jupiter Governour! (Enter LÃ¦tus introduced by Eclectus, who retires.) LÃTUS. I bring you tidings Disastrous to your peace: the enemy Has crossed the Milvian bridge. DIDIUS. The walls are manned? LÃTUS. With sailors from Misenum: but they roll Through unaccustomed martial exercise, As if they fought in dreams. DIDIUS. My elephantsâ LÃTUS. Have not been trained for war. The Romans laugh Like Momus' self to see the restive masses Turn on their riders. Jove, I almost laughed, The creatures have an incivility So huge! DIDIUS. Nay, LÃ¦tus, I have confidence; For though the rebel has his legions, I Have my PrÃ¦torians, every man a Mars, He moves in such a light from his array. If sailors man the walls, yet you command Rome's finest troops. Why should you damp me thus? LÃTUS. The Guards, indifferent to your call to arms, Gape as they fasten on their jewelled weapons, And kick the slaves who draw the buckles tight Of greave or cuirass. Do not blame the man Who works for you without one instrument Sharp for the work you give him. DIDIUS. But my wealth! Urge your faint legion with more promises, Go, vaunt my wide possessions. If I bought The universe, gods, I can buy my fate: Gold was sufficient, gold will now suffice. It moves even Heaven itself; the smoking shrines Shall be unstinted; statues all of gold, The head one solid lump, shall fire the temples With living glory. Fetch the Pontifex, Summon the priest of Jupiter. LÃTUS. Religion To heat your bathâah well! (Turning to go.) He is a fool. DIDIUS. Ye gods, removed above all mortal men, Severed by your great office from the crowd, Receive my many gifts and side with me, O ye the lonely Ones, O ye enthroned! (LÃ¦tus has paused at the door and raised his sword in the sheath: he suddenly drops it and retires. Didius starts at the sound and shivers involuntarily.) Fate, I'll give anything . . . your price, your price! Blood, treasureâoh, what more? I have the world, And all you ask is yours. (From the other side enter Cornelius.) Cornelius here! What is the purport of this haste? CORNELIUS. Revenge. I hoped to be your son-in-law, but when You heard my uncle suddenly had died, Leaving his riches to his cupbearer, You forfeited your promiseâand I starved. Now you are fronting ruin. I have crept About the city, hearing every voice: No soul within it loves you. DIDIUS. True, true, true! But, far beyond the people, I exist As Emperor of the world. My Guards are faithful CORNELIUS. With loyalty that apprehends your fall Will be their hour of punishment. One word Of kindness from Severus, they desert, And raise him on their shoulders. DIDIUS. Oh, what help? The danger thrills me. CORNELIUS. I alone can aid. DIDIUS. Then, by the love you bore my child . . . CORNELIUS. But stay! I claim her as reward. DIDIUS. She would consent. The world is nothing when I offer it; But I have seen her sweep along the streets. 'Twas Isis on a progress. CORNELIUS. You divine Our simple course is to anticipate Severus clemency. . . . If we would keep Your soldiers from corruption, he must die. DIDIUS. Assassination! That is infamous! CORNELIUS. But for what end?âthe safety of the State: One blow, a traitor to the empire falls. DIDIUS. If Fate demand a victim . . . yet my will Was ever clean of bloodshed. CORNELIUS. Recollect The wavering legion. DIDIUS. Recollect . . . (Enter Clara.) My child, My Empress every inch, you visit me! . . . Your faithful lover seeks to save us. CLARA. How? There is but one clear wayâSeverus dies. CORNELIUS. We ever thought alike: the deed is done. CLARA. Go, husband; all that you preserve is yours. Strike home, Cornelius. CORNELIUS. Love, I strike for you. (Exit.) DIDIUS. My full-lipped Beauty, no more separation! My child, my child, you come to me? One kiss! CLARA. I kiss you as we kiss the dead, forgetting The wrongs they did to us with cruel heart: And truly, father, you will soon be dead Unless you will take counsel from my lips. Each night I see you murdered in my dreams, And, waking, see the murderers gather round. Your fickle legion!âHave you once considered Who is their PrÃ¦fect? DIDIUS. LÃ¦tus. CLARA. Yes, the man Fame counts a double regicide. DIDIUS. Great Gods, He murdered Commodus. CLARA. Then Pertinax; And now to win forgiveness of your foe He would not hesitate to murderâ DIDIUS. Hush! I see it all, the monstrous wickedness. Blood, blood! My fate demands itâLÃ¦tus' blood. O child, you save me! CLARA. There are worse offenders, More to be feared than LÃ¦tus, who assemble About your person, lulling you asleep, That they may reach the aim of all their wiles, Your slaughter. Commodusâyou know the taleâ Was drugged, cajoled . . . by whom? DIDIUS. You make me tremble. It cannot be . . . and yet she bade me sleep. O Marcia! CLARA. She has soothed you recently With her still charm? DIDIUS. She bade me slumber on. CLARA. Then you are doomed, as she doomed Commodus. DIDIUS. Marcia, my friend! CLARA. She never owned your rule. DIDIUS. But Marcia! CLARA. And Eclectus and the PrÃ¦fect, They all could win forgiveness for old crimes By new crime, dripping red with bloodâwith yours. DIDIUS. Their blood, my Fate demands it! CLARA. You avengeâ You, not SeverusâRome's dead Emperors, Good Pertinax and Commodus the loved: This is the sacrifice the gods demand. DIDIUS. O child, most fearful Pythoness, your love Alone supports me in my misery; The whole world's faithlessness beside your faith Is as a ravening sea to one on land. These cruel murderers, too long protected, Shall meet their punishmentâthe PrÃ¦fect, Marcia, Eclectus . . . CLARA. Add Narcissus and his friend. DIDIUS. The athlete? Who beside him? CLARA. Pylades. Narcissus killed the Emperor at the beck Of Marcia, and Narcissus is the friend, The bosom-friend of Pylades. I ask That dancer's life again, not out of vengeanceâ Father, to save you: as I crossed the court, He talked, with heightened colour, furtively To Marcia, who replied with nod and smile. You never thought that he was of the band Said to have murdered Commodus. DIDIUS. 'Tis false. CLARA. Question him straight, and if you find him guilty, By your great honour as Augustus, promise That I shall have his life. DIDIUS. Let him be called. I promise; but the boy is innocent, He is not of that faction. You are jealous, You who come down to shield me, my Delight! What others traitors would you save me from? CLARA. I pray you, as your heiress, mark the doings Of Abascantus. It is very strange, I found him with a chisel prizing out The pearls embedded in the palace-walls; And as I passed he did not stand aside, Or cease from chipping. DIDIUS. I will see those pearls! Bid him attend me, tell my parasites To seize those murderers. . . . Call Pylades. (Exit Clara.) What, Abascantus a confederate With those who would betray! How stripped my life Is growing, how disgraced! (Enter Abascantus.) Well, Abascantus, Are you so hungry? Must the lustrous walls Be hacked to pieces? Will you strip my rooms? Remember how these gleaming avenues Have re-enforced me. This is merchandise! Break up the bars of gold, but leave the marbles, The ivories to my touch. O infamous, Wrenched from their socketsâthese! ABASCANTUS. Your favourite gems To comfort you in exile: for to-night We bid farewell to Latium. DIDIUS. Abascantus, And so you cling to me! Ah, if this harass Could be arrested! (Pylades runs in, but, seeing the Emperor engaged with Abascantus, he leans by a column at a distance, blowing soft, little notes on a flute he holds in his hand.) I am Emperor here, O'er whom, for what? . . . This flashing amethyst! And here is that great opal that struck red Each time I passed itâan unlucky sign, You said, but still a sign to me, a token, Something my presence changed! If we could flee, We two together, since I find you faithful, And leave this rifled empire to the gods! Say, my grim Midas . . . ABASCANTUS. We must wait on fortune! Gems are for flight; but drain your treasure-hoard, Sit easy on your throne, take the cold faces That strike on you like draughts as checks of strangers, Mere pressure of the world. If you can bribe The venal faith of the PrÃ¦torian Guards, And prove my caution premature . . . (He bows low to the Emperor and moves away, the great sack of jewels on his shoulder.) DIDIUS. So swiftly He disappears! How like a traveller, A wallet on his back . . . or like a thief. He shunned my scrutiny; something malign Was in his clutch, his gripping of the gems. Then, Fortune, I will spit at youâno fear, Open defiance! Pylades! What notes Of bird and wind and streaming water, notes That catch at me and let their sweetness hurt! O boy, I am beset on every hand, Such dangers and such enemies and fears, Such perturbations . . . but you know what happens, For you have lived in emperors' company. PYLADES. Yes, I have always dwelt in palaces, And seen how fortune works there. DIDIUS. You were present When Commodus was murdered? PYLADES. On the spot. I saw the lady Marcia leave his room, Within her hands the empty poison-bowl; I saw her fall down at Narcissus' feet And clasp his wrists and urge him with a gesture, Thus! (He mimics) Toward the Emperor's chamber, like an arrow, Narcissus sped . . . A struggle, but no groan, And then the happy wrestler brought his news, And told it breathless at fair Marcia's feet. She smiled on him . . . DIDIUS. Enough! I hate these mimes; I will not hear. PYLADES. But the consummate grace, The simple gratitudeâfor Commodus Had plotted to destroy her. Hear the whole! It was concealed while there was fear of vengeance, But now . . . DIDIUS (fascinated.) Rehearse the scene! PYLADES. A summer eve, The Emperor at his bath, his sacred chamber Untenanted, and on his couch a scrollâ Which, lo, a naked Eros, unespied, Crept toward and handled as a plaything: caught In the white arms of Marcia at the door, He held the thing aloft, and then she read Plain on the linden bark âLet Marcia die, She disapproves my course; Eclectus too Opposed my will, and LÃ¦tus: let them perish Together with the slave that yesterday Heated my bath too hot.â (He mimics with rhythmic gestures all the time.) Imperial Her self-control! She simply kissed the child, Gave him the bangle from her wrist in lieu Of the death-warrant, and then turned to me: âSpeed to Eclectus, speed!â When next I saw her The bowl was mixed. Medea, oh, her eyes! DIDIUS. Faugh, boy! you do not think, you give yourself With so extreme a passion to your mimes, This was a murder. PYLADES. Emperor, do you care? 'Tis through assassination, through a deed Less honourable than that high revenge, That you are sitting where you sit enthroned. DIDIUS. Yes, but . . . I did not murder Pertinax; I tremble at his murder . . . We must punish These wretched criminals. (Pylades stands transfixed.) It is your part To witness life before you play it to us: We cannot blame you. (Clara enters from the doorway.) CLARA. Cannot! Keep your promise, Father, your oath that Marcia shall be slain, Eclectus, the Egyptian, LÃ¦tus, all, All who have proved their infamy by this Informer's easy tongue. (A low cry from Pylades.) By my command The prisoners are without. Condemn them. (Moving toward the door.) Ho! Bring in these murderers! (Enter Clients and Parasites of Didius with Marcia, Eclectus, LÃ¦tus, and Narcissus.) (Clara points to Pylades.) His life is mine. PYLADES. Take it! (to Didius, who holds him back.) I did offend her as a woman May not brook insult: she must be avenged, Must slay me. But my friends, the innocent, Great friends I cling toâas you hope to breathe Unhaunted by dread ghosts, let Marcia live, Her husband, LÃ¦tus . . . I have been betrayed; I could not know your favour was withdrawn From these, long-favoured . . . Oh, I had no thought But of their . . . CLARA. Grace, and the effectiveness With which they murdered and you acted it. Can they disown the death of Commodus? MARCIA. No, we disown ourselves, disowning that, For never were we bent to any aim Substantial as that deed. A frenzied man In frenzy doomed usâthere were lives to save . . . CLARA. 'Tis well that you confess so brazenly The deed this dancer has rehearsed in full. I found him in the act, I saw him hold, Marcia, the poison-bowl and leer like you Above the honeyed beverage. PYLADES. My friends, I did not know . . . but what will you believe? What truth is possible except despair? My dearest on the earthâbelovÃ¨d, pardon! MARCIA. Poor boy! ECLECTUS. So you have struck her down at last, You venomous Athenian! MARCIA. No, Eclectus, This is not just; for you must surely see A sore mistake was made. ECLECTUS. I see the deed, I see who wrought it. DIDIUS. Bear the murderers out! Two Spectres who have worn my crown condemn Before the nether judge these sacrilegious, Secret confederates, who in my presence Avow the virtue of their punishment. Hence with them from my sight! CLARA. And Pyladesâ? (A pause.) I do not ask his life; no, let him live To comfort you with mimicry, to turn All that he sees to use, to represent Once more his Marcia with the bowl of wine And honeyed leer . . . Io, for our Pylades! We cannot spare him. DIDIUS. Cannot spare you, boy. CLARA. But I have slain my rival; for I knew The dancer's secret, though I never whispered A word of knowledge till my hour was come. Marcia is struck and ruined. MARCIA. She is happy. (Taking Eclectus' hand.) We die together. DIDIUS. Strangle themâhence, hence! PYLADES. Marcia to die . . . what, Marcia! (He falls in a swoon.) MARCIA (to Clara.) See your work! DIDIUS (to Clara.) Ay, see it! There is still another sentence, Another doom. Come to me, nearerâso! In the full light; I ever wrought my actions For all to see. Stand there! I banish youâ Oh, somewhereâto the Roman populace, To howls and execrations of pursuit. Go, outcast from my presence, to the streets, 'Tis there one suffers . . . I would blight you, child, With all the miseries I have borne for you. Let the sham-Emperor's daughter bear reproach! But nothing has abashed my fatherhood . . . There I am reverend, and you lied to me Of love and filial piety . . . Go forth! There will be retribution. CLARA. There will follow So much to hurt you, but I hurt the most. (Exit.) DIDIUS. With what a majesty she moves away! She surely is Augustaâand I wronged her; They are conspirators, they hem me round As in a fatal circle. Parasites, Old clients, friendsâthis favour! Bear them off! LÃTUS. Would I had slain you; but the twilight boat Will take us on one passage; we shall pay Our toll together. (Exit surrounded.) MARCIA (stooping and touching Pylades.) No: he is not dead. O Emperor, I have lived by emperors' thrones, One I served faithfully, and you I never Have injured in my life; if you would stay Free from the frenzy mastering royal heads, Keep this poor lad beside you; when the colour Is come to his white cheeks again, for comfort Say that I laid him down, thus, at your feet, And prayed your favour for him. (She lightly kisses Pylades' brow, then murmurs to Eclectus.) Nay, my husband, No jealousy! You only have my love. (to Didius.) Farewell, my friend and Emperor. Oh, believe There is no terror in the grave, you seeâ None in this hour it shadows. Come, my lord, Come, my dark lover, we are with the dead, With the great mysteries. Life is so vulgar, Let's leave it to the crowd. ECLECTUS. Osiris, judge! (They are all taken out.) DIDIUS. And yet 'tis just, How just it is to punish murderers, Secret assassins . . . Is Cornelius sped, I wonder? I am left without a slave To carry orders, or I would defer The execution of these sentences. (He stands trembling at the door.) I stand here, I am just a helpless child. What am I listening for, why do I listen? Why am I nailed against this door and helpless Until it is too late? Fortuna, rule! ConservatrixâO rudder of the world, Steer me across this swallowing gulf of sea, And I will build thee temples of such treasure Thou wilt not need to play with Oracles. All men will gather to thy gates and worship Thy marvellous possessions: Virilis, Thou one stability to which I cling, Firm in thine energy, with no remorse Feebling thine enterprise . . . It is accomplished; He died the first; I heard a stifled Vale, And then . . . I prayed more fervently to drown The gurgling noise. I need not listen more In horror and suspense and vacillation; Fortuna liberates. (Turning back from the door.) O Vale, Vale! Thou solemn, awful shade, I promise thee A funeral: there shall be all respect, Even to Eclectus with the bloody hand. Marcia! Oh, this is frenzy! I have heard Christians sleep soundly in their sealÃ¨d tombs, And do not turn till Minos drop the scales. This is a fever dancing at my heart, No apparition; for she died by justice, She said so, by sheer justice, while her eyes Coupled my doom with hers. Just for a moment She armed me with a steadiness to die; I could have died with her in sight; and then She bade me comfort Pylades: I will, If the boy be not dead. How white he looks, And how accusing in his innocence! Ah, he begins to sigh, he is alive, His features soften: he is but a dancer He will not dare rebuke me. Pylades! To give him pleasureâthat is all my life Is narrowed down toâPylades! PYLADES. Where am I? Quick, where is Marcia? DIDIUS. Lad, we all are doomed. PYLADES. Where's Marcia? DIDIUS. I forgotâshe left a message, She laid you at my feet . . . PYLADES. She did not touch me? DIDIUS. And kissed your brows and begged me to have pity And keep you by me. Then . . . PYLADES. I know the rest: She is not breathing any more, her name Is only for the echoes. So she kissed me, And laid me at your feet? DIDIUS. Asking protection; Boy, you shall have it. PYLADES. But I will not stay, Not for an instant. Marcia! She stood here, I left her standing here. Where was her voice In all that cloudy death? Oh, ominous! Are the gods buried?âfor I wake to find That there is nothing left to reinstate, And none I would have love me any more. Marcia! . . . How often I have called the dead, And danced the shadows. Marcia! O fierce Hades, Thou hast her in thy grasp. I will not call; This is mere acting, this is like a show. (He turns from Didius, looks out, and breathes in a low voice.) Andâah, ye secret gods, my soul is gone Down the great stream with her; we are removed Together from the crowd. I had before No sanctuary to my solitude, I fled I knew not whither. Oh, my hiding, My fastness in the rocks! I strike the earth, I offer up my sacrifice, my worship To him who keeps you locked up from the light. O hail, Aidoneus, hail, Persephone, Demetia, all ye darkness-bearing lands, The shade, the peace! DIDIUS. What is it, Pylades? An apparition? Boy, be merciful. She said I did it in a great mistake; I did: persuade her not to visit me. She knows I am the tool, the instrument OfâPyladesâmy child, this Didia Clara, Who is so busy marshalling my friends, My enemies against me. PYLADES. I remember. Oh, you have brought it back again . . . my dancing, The murder, Marcia. You vile hypocrite! You made me kill her with my lips and hands, Kill and betray. Polycrates' own curse Transmute your fortune into infamy! For you have made me hateful to myself As Ajax when he saw his work. DIDIUS. Oh, hush! The gods are not against you. Could you see The sword-wounds in my heart! I tell you, lad, I never wept like this but once, and then I was a boy and I had lost my mother: Now I have lost my only child. The girl Set all this plot onâfor my sake, she said; It was because she loves you. I could wish That I had sent you with the rest to die, For then she would be aimless in the world. How I have loved her! PYLADES. Oh, I breathe again! This blessÃ¨d hatredâand you too shall hate. I hate, hate, hate her. DIDIUS. Softly, I must weep So long before I come to hate. You twist Your feet, you tap the stones impatiently: Boy, there will be no dancing. By that door, Oh, think a little what I have to meetâ The Pontifex, The Vestal Virgins, the advancing Guard, Septimius Severusâand her face. PYLADES. I would see that again. If she is humbled, If all indignity is heaped on her, And she must play the part as a mere mime Of fallen princess, fallen majesty, If she should hear my laughâ (Enter Manlia with a Messenger, followed by the Pontifex.) DIDIUS. Her mother comes With anxious face, and then a messenger. Who follows? Rome, the Pontifex. MANLIA. Alas! MESSENGER. The Senate is assembled and proclaims Severus in your place. DIDIUS (to the Pontifex.) But Jupiter! I look beyond. There has been intercession. PONTIFEX. Severus owns the city, from the temples His incense rises. DIDIUS. Does he own the gods? PONTIFEX. He can command my prayers. DIDIUS. There are so many And new religions. I will try them all: The witch's mirror, human sacrifice, And secret incantations mixed with blood. It may be in my madness I have sought Some spectre-god and not reality. PONTIFEX (with a gesture of imprecation.) Devoted to the Infernal powers, farewell. (Exit the Pontifex.) DIDIUS. Was that a malediction? For a moment I feel a calmness, a support. If all We bear should be appointed . . . MANLIA. But our child, Where is our daughter? DIDIUS (to Messenger.) Human sacrifice On demon-shrines: it is the last resortâ An offering of young slaves . . . that might prefigure The thing I dread, avert it; and some parents Would suffer for my sake. (Exit Messenger.) MANLIA. My dearest husband, You lose your senses! We should be together As in a thunder-storm; one family Beneath the darkened heaven. Where is our child? (Re-enter Clara.) Clara, she comes! CLARA. Your wretched bolts will snap: Severus and his host are surging round. This is the life you give me with your gold, To be the prey of soldiers . . . No escape! And yet I must escape; my youth is crying For some fidelity, for some resource. No servant will obey me. Pylades, You, you alone can save me from my death; And after all, let honour go, not life. Give me that flute. You will not? Pylades, As I have loved you, Pylades! MANLIA. You dancer, Do as she bids! DIDIUS. Why does she want the flute? (Pylades grasps the instrument as if to break it.) CLARA. See! I have stripped off everything, except This slender robe; see, I have pulled my hair In locks about me: give me now the flute, And I will hide behind that screen, and pass For just a flute-girlâyours. O Pylades, Forget what I have said, what I have done. You have more power now than a king. (Kneeling.) Your flute! PYLADES (giving it without looking at her.) You have appealed as if to sanctuary. Take my poor reed you have despised, and keep The life that it can give you. It might happen . . . But be my flute-girl for a little while, And the gods change you! MANLIA. Is it come to this? My child a servantâno, a queen disguised, A lovely woman with that unbound hair. (Clara hides.) Well, Didius, we have had successâhave bought The world and tasted what its wares are like, Drawn out its sweetness, what was choice retained, And what was wearisome will now forego. We must not let possessions spoil the ease We seek for as possessors. Abdicate The empire, put distraction from your face, And quietly yield Severus what he asks. DIDIUS. Yes, he shall have it. Do we keep a tiger, Though we have bought with gold his yellow frame, If he is savage and attempts his cage, Threatening his master's life? I am impassioned To yield the government of earth and sea Entirely to Severus. Let him come! And yet . . . what noise is that? MANLIA. Ha, be composed! All will be well. DIDIUS. I do not want to live, But only to be sparedâI mean, delivered From violent death. I cannot want to live, Because my child has lied to me, because She, who was living treasury to my gold, Has not a place for me amid the splendour I bought her year by year. MANLIA. You ask too much, The common fault of parents. Husband dear, 'Tis a strange world at best, and recollect To-day has been a crisis. DIDIUS. I would live A little longer in a silent place, With just a dog. . . . Oh, if there were some kindness That made return to anything I did! They say the Christians go out to the desert, They say the foolish people find relief, And look, to all beholders, as if fed In those bare, stretching plains. I cannot tell . . . That was a bolt shot back! MANLIA. Your hand. DIDIUS. No, no! (Pylades runs to him.) There!âthey are coming. . . . Pylades! My boy, I will not lean on you; I would not lose Your life for all the world. Ah, beautiful, Dearest by far, go from me! On my lips I have my soul in kissing you. Away! (He pushes Pylades from him.) (Enter Septimius Severus, Senators, Tribunes, Officers of the Pannonian Legion and of the PrÃ¦torian Guardâbehind, Cornelius.) You come . . . SEVERUS. Led on by Fate, who takes my will For her elected weapon. DIDIUS. You desire My kingdoms: they are yours. I yield them up; They are not any longer to my taste. I do not ask copartnership of rule, That would be . . . SEVERUS. Nothing. In my dreams I ride Lord of a whole, not half. The world is mine. DIDIUS. I give it you. SEVERUS. I took it for myself, And now I enter on my universe. Depart! DIDIUS (to Manlia.) Come home . . . and Clara? MANLIA. Noblest lord Of us as other men, since we withdraw So peaceably from empire, on my knees I ask our private fortune may be spared To nourish me, my husband, and our child. We leave the world to you; protect our home, And keep it sacred, by the victor gods! SEVERUS. What does this mean? Arrest that fugitive, That trafficker, and set him face to face With me whose hands are pure. (Didius is arrested.) You would escape, You who have done this insult to the earth, And prostituted Rome? (To his Officers.) Strip off that band His forehead makes ridiculous. Advance The officers of the PrÃ¦torian Guard: They and their tool shall meet again. (To the PrÃ¦torians.) You murdered That venerable man, that noble prince Whose life it was your duty to defend; You insolently sold at public mart His glorious empire to a rich poltroon. Your sin is not the sin of men, it is A despicable, abject, mawkish sin, That shall not have a stately punishment. You are no longer soldiers and no more Inhabitants of Rome. Remove their arms, And banish them in nakedness as far As twelve miles from the city. (To Didius.) As for you, Who have disowned your cause, who could believe Gold is the source of life's validity, One end awaits you. Take him to the room Within the baths where Pertinax was dragged, And let him be beheaded. MANLIA. Ah, my lord, A woman and a wifeâyou too are married, Your wife can boast a regal horoscopeâ SEVERUS. Peace! This is not a time for women's reasons To pester virtue. DIDIUS. Prisonâanything But send me from the world! I saw the trunk Of Pertinax, I saw it . . . do you hear? Saw it . . . I did not murder Pertinax. I am not false and I have done no harm; I have but squandered all my substance. Spare me To die as you might hope that you will die, Not . . . There I first saw headless Pertinax. All I possess to keep my head! SEVERUS. I struck The blow that severed it some moments back; My words are deeds. DIDIUS. But, man, I did no harm. I bought the world. O justice! SEVERUS. And your head Will pay for it: complete the bargain now. (With a deep groan, he is dragged out.) Madam, I have no rancour in my heart To any Roman. Had I heard your prayer, I should no more be worthy to create The Empire of my omens here in Rome. I have no wish to injure you. The body Of your late husband is your own, to lay In any sepulchre with any honour Your inclination prompts. You bent your knees To ask of me your private property; It shall not be sequestered from your use, Yours and your children's. You are comely still, And may forget bereavement of your husband And empire with the years. MANLIA. (weeping.) O noble bounty! I will not speak of all that I have lost; For in this curious world we must not turn A single look on anything too deep In any joy or sorrow: we are mortal, And much the gods inflict on us should be As mortal as our weakness, and should die Save to our silence. Gracious conqueror You will restore us guarded to our house, Me and my daughter? SEVERUS. Is your daughter here? (Clara comes forward, her hair roughly coiled.) CLARA. Crushed down beneath your great success, I feared You might be cruel-hearted, and revenge My father's folly on his child: I hid, I made myself a flute-girl, put away My ornaments, my rank; and I have tasted The bitterest poverty behind that screen. This flute is but a bar of torturing iron, And this short robe immodest, till I blush A fire of raging consciousnessâforgive That you behold me thus! Nay, mother, lend Your cloak to cover me. Great Emperor, hail! We live through your capacious mercy; heaven Grant you rich days and prosper you! (To Pylades.) The flute! Here, take your wretched instrument. Preserve me From ever piping to you! (As she returns it, he starts as if from a dream: he has seen nothing, heard nothing since Didius was borne away.) SEVERUS. Who is this? CLARA. A celebrated dancer who amuses The wealthy at their feasts: your client. SEVERUS. Then His art must use its grace in serving me. You have fine limbs and speaking hands. PYLADES. Ah, yes, A master trained me, and the gods confide Their legends to my limbs: there is no gift Like mine, there cannot be. SEVERUS. Devoutly said! To-morrow night there is high festival; You will be welcome. (To a Tribune.) Guard these ladies home. CORNELIUS (advancing, with a deep obeisance to Severus.) I thank you, noble Emperor, for protection Of an unhappy house. By courtesy I am this lady's son; may I attend? SEVERUS. You gave my entry zealous welcome: go. (Clara presents her hand to Cornelius; they leave, followed by Manlia and a Tribune.) I must receive the Senate. (Exit with his followers.) PYLADES. (as they go out.) And I dance To-morrow in the Regia; so I live: The world is mine whoever comes and goes.</field>
