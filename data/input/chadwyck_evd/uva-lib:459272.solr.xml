      <field name="fulltext">Doe all thinges to edifie the Congregation. Diogenes which vsed a barell for his house, Being fled fr? his father to ye citie of Ath?s, C?forted him self much in beholding ye mouse which desired neither castell nor hold for her def?ce C?cerning sustentati?, she made no differ?ce, But eate what soeuer to her did befall, And touching her apparell, she had least care of all. This poore mouses propertie noted Diogenes, Whiche oftentimes also, he would haue in sight, And though he ware disciple vnto Antisthenes, yet he learned of the mouse as muche as he might In the science of Sophy he had great delight, But concerning his state, and outward condition The most can declare, if you make inquisition. On a time he chaunsed accumpanied to be With Alex?der, which stode betwene him &amp; the sonne What requirest thou to haue Diogenes (quod he?) Is there any thing that by me may be done? I pray thee stande asyde, and make a little roume (quod Diogenes) that the sunne vpon me may shine, Nought els requier I of that that is thine. He vsed to saie, that as seruauntes be obedient To their bodely maisters being in subiection, Euen so euill men that are not contente, Are subiectes and slaues to their lustes and affection, This lesson vnto vs may be a direction, Which way our inclination to bridle and subdewe, Namely if we labour the same to eschewe. Thus see you howe little this Philosopher estemed the aboundaunt possessions of this m?daine treasure Which yet notwithstanding at these dayes is demed to be the originall and fountaine of pleasure, this causeth luste to raigne without measure, to the whiche men are subiectes, Diogenes doth say, yet both lost and treasure in time weareth awaye. A Philosopher is he that wisedome doth loue, Which before Pithagoras, wyse men ware named Nowe Diogenes being wyse, this doth approue that some m? of this age, ought as fooles to be blamed For where the one with treasure lack, his life framed the other trauaile, care, and labour with gredines, the same by all meanes, to enioye and possesse. But as Luste with the luster, conuerteth to duste And leaueth of force, his pleasaunt prosperitie, So treasure in time, is turned to ruste: As S. Iames in his epistle sheweth the veritie Hereof we purpose to speake without temerite, Therefore our matter is named, ye triall of Treasure, Which time doth expell, with all mundaine pleasure. Both mery and short we purpose to be, And therfore require your pardon and pacience, We truste in our matter nothing you shall see, That to the godly may geue any offence, Though ye style be barbarous, not fined with eloqu?ce Yet our Author desireth your gentle acceptation, And we the plaiers likewyse, with all humilation. Finis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Luste like a gallaunt, singing this songe. Hey howe care away let the world passe For I am as lusty as euer I was, In floures I florishe as blosomes in May, Hey howe care away: hay howe care away. Luste. What the Deuill ailed me to singe thus, I crie you mercy by my faith for entring, Moste like I haue ridden on the fliyng Pegasus, Or in Cock Lorrels barge I haue bene a ventringe, Syng: why I would singe if it were to doe againe, With Orpheus and Amphion I went to schole, What, laddes must be liuely attending on the traine Of lady Delectation, whiche is no small foole. Hey rowse, fill all the pottes in the house, Tushe man, in good felowship let vs be mery, Looke vp like a man or it is not worth a louse. Hey how troly lowe, hey dery dery, Ha pleasaunt youth and lusty Iuuentus, In faithe it is good to be mery this may, For of mans liuing here, there is no point endentus. Therfore a litle mirth is worth much sorow some say. Enter Iuste. But remember ye not the wyse mans sentence, It is better in the house of mourning to be Th? in the house of laughter where foly hath resid?ce, For lightnes with wisedome can not agree Though many haue pleasure in foolishe phantasie. Ensuing their inclination and luste, Yet much better is the life of one that is iuste. Luste. Sir, in this you seme against me to inuaye, Iuste. Nothing but reason I thinke I doe saye. Luste. Mary you shall haue a night cap for making yt reason, Frinde haue you not a pece of stockefishe to sell, I would you had a dishe of butterd peason, By my faith your communication likes me well, But I beseche you tell me is not your name Iuste: Iuste. Yes forsothe. Luste. And my name thou shalt vnderstande is lust, And according therto I am lusty in deede, But I thinke thou haste drunke of Morpheus seede, Thou goest like a Dromeldory dreaming &amp; drousy, I holde twenty pounde the knaue is lousy. Iuste. Myne apparell is not like vnto thyne, Disguysed and iagged of sundrie fashion, Howe be it, it is not golde alwayes that doth shine, But corrupting Copper of small valuation To horrible besides is thy operation, Nothing more odious vnto the Iuste, Then the beastly desires of inordinate luste. Luste. It is a shamefull thing as Cicero doth saye That a man his owne actes should praise &amp; c?mende, Hypocrites accustome thee like daye by daye Checking other men, when they doe offende. Iuste. Yea but it is an harde thing saieth the Philosopher, For a foolishe man to haue his maners reprehended, And euen at this daie it is come so farre, God graunt for his mercy it may be amended. For tell a man friendly nowe of his faulte Being blasphemy, pryde, or vyle fornication, He wilbe as presumptuous as Haman the haulte And repaye with reuenge or els defamation. Thus fewe men a friendly monition will beare, But stoutely persiste and mainteine their ill, And in noble mens houses truly I do feare There are to many haue suche froward will. Luste. Woundes and hartes who can abyde this, Nay ye vyle vylayne I will dresse you therefore, your lasy bones I pretende so to blisse, That you shall haue small luste to prate any more. Iuste. Behold the Image of insipient fooles, There are not a fewe euen nowe of thy propertie, Untill you be put into pouerties scholes: ye will not forsake this folishe insolencie. Luste. Nay soft, with thee I haue not made an ende. Drawe out his swoorde. Iuste. The Iust against lust must alwayes contend, Therfore I purpose to wrestle with thee, Put it vp. Who shall haue the victorie, streightwaye we shal see. Luste. When thou wilt by his fleshe: I shall holde the wag Wrestle, and let Luste seeme to haue the better at the firste. Iuste. I know that lust vseth not litle to brag: Luste. Thou shalt find me as mighty as Sampson ye str?g Iuste. yea the battell of lust endureth long. Luste. Woundes and fleshe, I was almost down on my back, But yet I will wrestle till my bones cracke. Staye and then speake, Iuste. The ende of thy presumption nowe doth appeare, Luste. yet dooe what thou canst I will not lie here, No by his woundes you olde doting knaue, Caste him and let him arise again. thinkest thou that lust will be made a slaue, I shall mete you in Smithfield or els other wheare, By his flesh and bloud, I will thee not forbeare. Iuste. Not of my power I doe thee expell But by the mighte of his spirite that dwelleth in me, Inordinate luste with the iust may not dwell, And therfore may not I accompanie thee. Luste. Well goodman Iuste, it is no matter, But in faithe I pretende not with thee to flatter, Go out, he must driue him out. Though from thy company departe I muste, I shall liue in as much welthynes I truste. Iuste. Where moste wealth is and moste dilectation, There Luste is commonly of moste estimation: For where as wealth wanteth idlenes doth slake But where idlenes is Lust parteth the stake. Pause. Thus haue you seene the conflicte of the Iuste, Which all good men ought to vse and frequent For horrible are the fruites of inordinate luste, Whiche in some case resemble Hybra the serpent, Whose head being cut of an other ryseth incontinent. So one of Lustes cogitations being cut away There ryseth vp an other, yea many we may saye: It is requisite therfore that euery degree Against this his lust, both striue and contende, And though at the first he seeme sturdy to be, The Lorde will conuince him for you in the ende. Your cause vnto him therefore holy commende, Labouring to auoyde all inordinate luste, And to practise in lyfe, to liue after the Iuste. Go out, Enter Inclination the Uise. I can remembre synce Noes ship Was made and builded on Salisbury plaine, The same yeere ye weathercock of Paules caught ye pip So that Bowe bell was like much woe to sustaine, I can remembre I am so olde. Since Paradise gates were watched by night, And when that Uolcanus was made a cuckold Among the great Gods I appeared in sight Nay for all your smiling I tell you true, No no ye will not knowe me nowe, The might on the earth I doe subdue, tush, if you will giue me leaue yle tell ye howe, Howe, in good faith I carenot greatly, Although I declare my dayly encrease But then these gentlewomen wilbe angry, therfore I thinke best to holde my peace: Nay I beseche you let the matter staye, For I would not for twenty po?de come in their h?des For if there should chaunce to be but one dalila, By the mas thei would binde me in Samsons bands But what meane I first with them to beginne, Seing that in all men I doe remaine, Because that first I remayned euen within, And after her Adam and so foorth to Caine, I perceiue by your lookes my name ye would knowe, Why you are not ignoraunt of that I dare saye, It is I that doe guyde the bente of your bowe, And ruleth your actions also daye by daye, Forsothe I am called Natural inclination Whiche bred in old Adams fostred bones, So that I am proper to his generation I will not awaye with casting of stones, I make the stoutest to bowe and bende: Againe when I luste I make men stande vprighte From the lowest to the highest I doe ascende, Drawing them to thinges of naturall might. Enter Luste, and Sturdines, singing this songe. Where is the knaue, that so did raue: O that we could him finde, We would him make, for feare to quake That loute of lobbishe kinde. My name is lust, &amp; let him truste That I will haue redresse, For thou and I, will make him flie, Mine oulde friende Sturdines. Luste. Where is nowe that valiaunt Hercules, For all his bragges he is nowe ronne away: Sturdi. Braggingly By the guttes of Golya, it is best for his ease, For he was moste like for the pottage to paye. Inclina. Cockes soule: what bragging knaues haue we here, Come ye to conuince the mightiest conquerer, It was I that before you now doth appeare, Which brought to confusion both Hector &amp; Alexander: Looke on this legge ye prating slaues, I remember since it was no greater then a tree, At that time I had a cupple of knaues Muche like vnto you that wayghted on me. Luste. Cockes precious soule, let vs conquer the knaue, Sturdi. By his fleshe and sydes, a good courage I haue, Stande you therfore a litle asyde And ye shall see me quickely abate the fooles pryde. Drawe out the swearde, make him put it vp, &amp; then strike him, looke in your spectacles. Inclina Naye I dare not I if thou lookest so bigge, What should suche a Bore fight with a pigge. Put vp thy swoorde man we will agree, So lo: doe so much as beare that for mee. Sturdi. Nay by his harte, then I will you dresse. Inclina. Be Good in thine office gentle friend Sturnines, For though thou and I doe seme to contende, yet we are, and must be friendes till the ende. Sturdi. Come geue me thy hande I beshrowe thy harte. Inclina. Nay you must take all thinges in good parte, Who standeth yender captaine Luste? Sturdi. Yea mary. Inclina. No remedy then to him go I must, you haue forgot I dare say your old frend Inclinati? But let vs renew acquainta?ce again for cocks passi? Luste. Why man our acquaintaunce hath bene of olde, I am yours at commaundement therfore be bolde, For Luste can doe nothing without Inclination, Chiefly in matters concerning a pleasaunt vocation. Incli. In dede Luste may be taken for a thing indifferent Except Inclination be ioyned therevnto, But when that I once haue reaueled my entent, As I will men to worke so commonly they doe, Luste. Ye haue harde of the combate betwene me &amp; Iust. Inclina. ye mary, I harde saye that you laye in the dust. Luste. What saye ye. Inclina. Neither one worde nor other ye may me truste. Luste. Of mine honestie my company he vtterly refused, And in wrestling with me he gaue me the foyle, Saiyng: that I had my selfe and other abused. Leading men in perplexitie &amp; marueilous toile. Sturdi. By gogs woundes if we had founde him here, We should by his fleshe haue abated his chere. Incli. I perceiue Sturdines thou art no foole, Tell me of felowship where wentest thou to schole, Sturdi. What to reade or wrighte. Incli. Nay to sweare and fight. For I thinke thou canst neither wryte, reade, nor spel, But in swearing and fighting thou doest excell. Sturdines. Thou knowest that I am ioyned with Luste, And Sturdy by nature I am in like case, What let the worlde wag, all can not be Iuste, Some must Naturall inclination embrace. Luste. All men Iuste: no, I remember the sentence of Tully That no man is Iuste, that feareth death, pouertie or paine, which I do feare all &amp; that marueilously, For fortune is variable I doe perceiue playne, And notwithstanding that Flix possessed great gaine, yet when Paule preached of the iudgement daye, He trembled for feare and bad him go awaye. Inclina. Doth such passions often trouble your mynde. Luste. Nay not often, but sometime I doe them finde, But then to the entent to dryue them awaye, I either go to sleape, or els to some playe. Sturdi. By gogs precious harte, euen so doe I, But sometyme they comber me pestilently. Inclination. Well maister Luste, such dumpes to eschewe My aduise and request you must nedes ensue, That is to become disciple to doctor Epicurus, And then you shall haue myrth by measure &amp; ouerplus Tushe, I knowe a cupple companions in store That ware marueilous mete for you euermore. I wishe you vnto them. Luste. Well then call them in. Incli. Here they come each of them in a knaues skinne. Enter Elation and Gredy gutte. With luste to liue is our delight, In highe estate and dignitie, Seing that the Iust put vs to flight, Let them alone in miserie. Sturdi. Nay, they be lusty laddes I tell ye. Elation What Inclination, me thought I did smell thee, Gyue me thy hande or we forther go. Inclina. Nowe welcome in faith, and Gredy gutte also, But syrs, are none of you both acquainted with Lust. Luste. Yes that they haue bene both of them I truste, welcome syrs in faithe welcome vnto me. Elation. By my trothe I am glad your maistership to see In health and prosperitie, as presently you bee. Gredy. Bom fay zo am I wod all my harte. Inclina. This cowe bellied knaue doth come from the carte, Ise teache you to speake I hold you a pounde, Curchy Lob curchy, downe to the grounde. Gredy. Che can make curchy well enowe. Inclina. Lower old knaue or yle make ye to bowe, The great bellied loute me thinke can not bende, yes so lo, he beginneth now to amende. Luste. Well syrs, nowe I remember Esopes aduise whiche he gaue to the Samies against king Crassus, Therfore it is good to be wittie and wyse, And being in libertie to kepe me still thus: I can not abide a life that is dolorous, And seing that my name is properly Luste, I hate the conuersation also of the Iuste. Inclina Well maister Luste, first ioyne you to me Inclinati? Next here with Sturdines you must you acquainte Turne you about and embrace Elation, And that wealth may encrease without any restraint Ioine you with Gredy gutte here in our presence, That all these in you may haue prosperous influence. Bowe to the grounde. Luste. Out alas, what a sodaine passion is this, I am so taken that I can not stande, The crampe, the crampe, hath touched me ywis, I shall die without remedie nowe out of hande. Gredy. By my matens chese, our maister is sicke. Inclina. Stande back Nycoll nody with the pudding pricke, More braines in thy skinne then witte in thy braine, Such Gredy guttes in faith would be flayne, This crampe doth signifie nothing in effect But howe he is bowed by me Inclination, None of all your councels he will nowe reiecte, And therefore feare not to make full declaration. Sturdi. Then feare not the force of these that be iuste, But labour your selfe to aduaunce and augment, Be iocound and liuely sithe your name is lust, And then you shall easely obteine your entente. Elation. Esteme your selfe alwayes equall with the beste, And seeke for promotion, power, and dignitie: It is good when men may liue as they luste, And vnto the iuste beare hate and malignitie. Gredy. O zur ye must be gredy to catche and to clawe. Incli. Well said Gredy gutte, as wyse as a dawe, Gredy. Eate vp at a mouthfull, houses and landes. Gape and the Uise gape. Incli. Theres a vengeable mouth to, Gredy. Neuer feare God nor the gouernours lawe, But gripe gripe gredely all that cometh in your h?ds. By the Masse but Hewe Howlet is pestilens witty, What guttishe gredinesse the horeson can teache That thou art not erected in faith it is pitie, As hie as three trees, and a halter will reache. Luste. Mary syrs, but your councels hath set me on fire. Hey lusty lad, ho w freshe am I nowe, Leade me Inclination to haue my desire, And then at thy request I wyll euer bende &amp; bowe. Incli. He that bendeth to folowe his owne inclination, Must nedes liue a wicked and vile conuersation, But go maister Luste, I will leade you to a place Where you shall haue pleasure enough in short space. Luste. yea, but shall not this company goe thether. Inclina. yes mary we foure will all go together, But Sturdines shall tary to face out the matter, If Iuste peraduenture against you should clatter. Sturdi. By the masse, and well said, but first let vs sing, Incli. I must tune my pipes first of all with drinking. Elation Tushe what then, I praie thee help vs beare a part. Incli. yes I will sing the trouble with all my harte. Luste shalbe led by inclination To carnall cogitation, Where luste is led wholy by me, He must fall to Cupidite, For carnall cares shall him assaile, And spedely they shall preuaile. I Sturdines will face it out, In his cause, sturdy stiffe and stoute, Then Gredy gutte shall make him eate, Both house &amp; lands, like bread &amp; meate. Elation shal puffe him hie For to aspier aboue the skie, Then natural and lordly luste, Shall with his poure dispise the Iuste. Elation. Our songe is ended haste thou other in store, Inclina. I shall not haue done this halfe houre and more, yet I will nowe I remember, come in Luste That I go before is but nedefull and iust, Go out all foure. you shalbe nowe led by me Inclination to reason and talke with Carnall cogitation. Sturdi. Is there more vanitie vnder neath the sonne, Then to be inclined after this sorte, well Luste doth now as other haue done, yea, and doe daye by daye, esteming it a sporte, this Luste is the Image of all wicked men, whiche in seeking the worlde, haue all delectation, they regarde not God nor his c?maundementes tenne But are wholy led by their owne Inclination, First to inculcate with Carnall cogitation, And after to the desier of all worldly treasure, whiche alone they esteme the fulnes of pleasure with Elation or Pride he is also assotiate, which puffeth vp his sences with presumption pestil?t then Gredy gutte maketh them continually to grate On ye mock of this world which he th?keth perman?t, I sturdines to beare out all thinges, am bent: thus see you howe men that are led by their luste, Dissent from the vertuous godlie and Iuste. Go out. Enter Iuste and Sapience. Sapi?ce The aduise of Aristippus haue in your mynde, which willed m? to seke such thinges as be perman?t And not such as are of a vanishing kinde For the one with the other is not equiualent, Be circumspect therefore, forseing and Sapient, For treasures here gotten are vncertaine and vaine, But treasures of the mynde do continually remaine. Iuste. This is the mynde of Musonus also I remembre, Like as presently you haue aduertised me, For the which I can not but thankefully render, Such commendations as is requisite to be, And as your name is Sapience, thus muche I see, That on heauenly wisedome you doe depende, And not on as time doth bring to an ende. Sapi?ce Truthe in deede, &amp; therfore your name being Iuste, With me and my documentes must be assotiate, Where contrary suche as are led by their lust, To incline euill are alwayes appropriate, They haue not as you haue, battel &amp; combate, Against the cogitations that inwardly spring, But rather are obedient vnto the same thing, And this is the occasion that men are so ambitious, And so foolishe led by the luste of their braine, Sometime to couet, sometime to be vicious, Sometime the councell of the wyse to disdaine, Sometime to clime till they fall downe againe, Sometime to vsurpe the possessions of other, Sometime to disobeye both father and mother. Iuste. Alas what auaileth it ryches to enioye, Though as muche in c?parison as Cressus the king, What helpeth it to haue Helene in Troye, If the conscience of man continually sting, Elation and Pride, no commoditie doth bring, But is often knowen the forerunner of shame, And the blotte of immortall memorie and fame. Enter Inclination the Uise. Nowe by my hallydome it is alone a, Better sporte in my life I neuer sawe, It is trimme I tel you to da?ce with Iohn &amp; Ione a: We passe not a point for God nor his lawe, But Lust is lusty and full of porridge, Cogitation and he, in one Bed doth lie When: here is maister Iuste with his cancred corage, What an olde doting, Sapience then I am dressed I, So often already Iuste hath me restrained, That I dare not entise him any more, For through Sapience he hath me clerely disdained That my courage is spent, and I haue no more. Make a going back, Sapi?ce Nay softe syr we must talke with you or ye go. Incli na I can not tary at this time the truthe is so. Iuste. Nay, there is no remedy with you we must talke. Inclina. By the body of me, I holde best that I walke, Or els learne to speake language another whyle, And so I may happen the knaues to beguyle. Iuste. Turne back or you go, we haue somewhat to say. Incli. Non point parla fransois, nonne par ma foy. Sapi?ce To deceiue vs nowe him selfe he doth prepare. Incli. Ick en can ghene englishe spreken vorwaer, Body of me let me go, or els I shall pisse, Iwis maister Iuste, you haue loued me or this, Therfore nowe be ruled after my councell, And godly thinges for your commoditie I shall you tel Sapi?ce Let him that is Iuste not lightly ensue, His vyle inclination and carnall concupicence, But let him rather contende the same to subdue, And chiefly those that haue knowledge of Sapience, Therefore to brydle this luste do your diligence, His craftie prouocations vtterly to restrayne, That Iust may liue whyle life doth remaine. Inclina. Godd man hoball speake you in earnest: What doest thou saye, shall the Iust bridle me, No, no, brother snappes, doe the worste and thy best, I will not be bridled of him nor of thee. Iuste. Seing Sapience consisteth in heauenly document, And that heauenly document consisteth in sapience To bridle this wretche I can not but consent, Sithe I of his purpose haue had oft intelligence. Inclina. Yet againe brydle, it doth not preuayle, I will not be bridled of the best of you both, See you this gere heres one will make you to quaile, Stande backe, to kil you maister iust I would be loth you haue bene so burned and fried of late, That it were pitie to hurte you any more, Back I say, or my dagger shall about your pate, By the masse but I will syr, yle make your bones sore. Struggle two or thre tymes, Iuste. I wil l bridle thee beast for all thy bragging. Incli. In faith good man Iuste, yle holde ye wagging, Nay brother, ye shall finde me a curste colte to bridle, Nay in faith, better yet I will make thee to struggle. Sapi?ce Neuer leue him but ensue the councell of sapience. Iuste. Lo nowe I haue brought him vnder obedience. Brydle him. Incli. Not so obedient as thou thinkest me to haue, Nay brother, ye shall finde me a coltishe knaue, We he, he, it is good for you to holde faste, For I will kicke and winche whyle thy lyfe doth laste. Sapi?ce Thou shalt kicke in deede but no victory wynne, Neither to conquer the Iust to vngodlines nor sinne, Incli. O yes, O yes, I will make a proclamation. Iuste. What shall that be? Incli. If ye will geue me leaue then you shall see, O yes, is there any man or woman that hath lost, A gambolling gelding with a graye tayle, Let him come to the Crier and paie for his coste, And he will tell him tidinges without any fayle. Sapi?ce To the entent that you may him sharpely restraine, Let him not enioye so muche of the raine. Bridle him shorter. Inclina Cockes soule, nowe the snaff e cutteth my lip, I would this luberly knaue had the pip, I shall leape no hedges while this brydle is on, Out alas, I thinke it will fret me to the bone. Sapi?ce Thus should euery man that wilbe called Iuste, Brydle and subdue his beastly inclination, That he in the ende may obtaine perfect truste, The messenger of God to geue sight to saluation. Iuste. That truste to obtaine with him I haue struggled, Sapi?ce Then let vs departe and leaue this beast bridled. Go out both, Inclina. Mary the deuill go with you and his dun dame, Such horse maisters will make a colte quickely tame, I would he were hanged that this snaffell did make, It maketh my chappes so shamefully to ake, ye haue no pitie on me you I se by your laughing, I care not greatly if I fall to gambolling, We he, he, he, he, he, come alofte I saye, Beware the horse heles I auise you, stande awaye, The raine of my bridle is tied so shorte, That I can not make you any more sporte, But though I be bridled now of the Iuste, I doubte not but I shalbe vnbridled by Luste, And let not Iust thinke but I will rebell, Although he bridle me tenne times all well, Though nature saith one dome with a croche, It will not lie long but incontinent aproche, Eeuen so, though that I be bridled a whyle, The Colte will at length the Curser beguyle, Enter Gredy gutte running and catche a fall, Gredy. Chill runne I as fast as I can, zures did none of you zee a man, Cham zent in haste from my maister Luste, So that Inclination nedes come to him must. Incli. Where is he nowe I praye thee tell me. Gredy. Why what haue we here Iesus benedicite, I holde twenty pounde it is Baalams Asse, Nay tis a Colte, I see his tayle by the masse. Incli. Am I a Colte, nay thou liest lyke a knaue, Somewhat for thy labour nowe shalt thou haue. Gredy. Ho ball ho, lousy Iade must ye kicke. Inclina. Who euer sawe suche a desperate Dicke, Why Gredy gutte, doest thou not knowe Inclinati?? Gredy. Body O me, who hath drest thee of that fashion, Thou arte brydled for byting nowe in deede, Syra, maister Luste would haue thee make spede. Incli. I am bridled I, euen as thou doest see, Therefore desier him to come and helpe me, But what is the matter that he for me sente. Gredy. Mary to gather with Gredines, nowe he is bent, He hath had long talke with Carnal cogitation, And is set on fier by the meanes of Elation, So that he is so lusty he can not abyde. Therefore one or other for him must be spied. Inclina. Well Gredy gutte, I praye thee goe and make haste. Gredy. Tushe feare not, chill spende no time in waste. Incli. I had rather then .xl. pence that he ware come, If I be bridled long I shalbe vndone, So sharpe is this snaffell called restrainte, That it maketh me sweate I am so faint: Harke, I heare the voyce of my maister Luste, Now I shalbe vnbridled shortly I truste. Enter Luste, Luste. Cocks precious woundes, here hath bene vilanie Inclina. Ye, ye they haue vsed me with to much vilanie, That old knaue Sapience so counseled Iuste, But let me be vnbridled good maister Luste. Unbridle him, Luste. Lo now thou art vnbridled, be of good chere, By lady I am glad I haue gotten thus cleare, But hark? you maister Lust, if I may do you pleasure Whisper, She is called Treasure. Luste. O my harte is on fyre till she come in place. Inclina. O maister Luste, she hath an amiable face, A tricker, a trimmer, in faith that she is, The goddes of wealth, prosperitie and blisse. Luste. But thinke you that this minion long endure shall. Inclina. For euer and euer man, she is immortall: There be many other, but she exceadeth them all. Luste. What be they, haue you their names in store, Inclina. Yea harke in your eare. whisper, &amp; many other more Luste. Sithe that the apple of Paris before me is cast, And that I may deliuer the same where I will, I would Prometheus were here to helpe me hold fast That I might haue a fore witte with me euer still, Pallas I consider in science hath skill, But Iuno and Uenus, good will doe I beare, Therfore to geue the Appull I know not where. Incli. Be conciled by me and geue it lady Treasure, It shalbe for your c?moditie in ye end without measur For hauing the company of this minion lasse, you shall neuer wante the societie of Pallas, Iuno, nor yet the armipotent Mars, Can not resiste your strengthe be they neuer so fearce And as for Uenus, you shall haue at pleasure, For she is bought and solde alwayes with Treasure, She of her power hath whole countries conquered The most noble ch?pions by her hath ben murthered Acon for her sake was stoned to death, Tushe, innumerable at this day spende their breath, Sume hange or be hanged, they loue her so well, She is the great goddesse, it is true that I tell. Luste. Which way should I worke of her to haue a sight. Incli. I Inclination will leade you thyther right, But we must haue Gredy gutte and also Elation. Luste. They are at the house of carnall Cogitation. Whether I would wyshe that we might departe. Inclina. Iwill leade you thether with all my harte. Go out. Enter Iust, Trust, a woman playnly, and Contentation, knele downe &amp; sing, she haue a crowne, So happy is the state of those, That walke vpright and iuste, That thou Lorde doest thy face disclose By perfect hope and truste. Their Inclination thou doest stay, And sendest them Sapience, That they should serue and eke obey, Thy highe magnificence. Thou sendest contentation, That we in thee may rest, Therefore all adoration, To thee perteineth best. Iuste. God careth for his as the Prophet doth saye, And preserueth them vnder his mercifull wynges, Namely the Iuste that his will doe obey, Obseruing his holy commaundement in all thinges, Not for our sake, or for our deseruinges, But for his owne sake openly to declare, That all men on earth ought to lyue in his feare. Truste. Howe God hath blissed you all men may see, For first at your entraunce you conquered Luste, Not by your power, but by myght of the deitie, As all persons ought to doe that be Iuste, Then through Sapience which God did you sende, You bridled that brutishe beaste Inclination, And also ordred you with Contentation. Conten. Those that are contented with their vocation, Be thankefull to God, this is a true consequent, And those that be thankefull in their conuersation, Can not but please the Lorde God omnipotent, But those that be sturdie, proude, and disobediente, The Ruler of all Rulers will them confounde, And rote their remembraunce of from the grounde. Iuste. When Solon was asked of Cressus the king, What man was moste happie in this vale terestriall, To the ende he semeth to attribute that thing, When men be asociate with treasures celestiall, Before the ende can no man iudge he doth saie, That any man is happie that here beareth breath, But then by his ende pretely iudge we may, Thus true happines coesisteth saith he after death. If this be a truthe as vndoubtedly it is, What men are more foolish, wretched and miserable, Th? those yt in these treasures acc?pt their whole blys Being infect with ambition that sicknes vncurable, A wicked Adrastia, thou goddes deceiuable, Thus to plucke from men the sence of their mynde, So that no contentation, therein they can finde. Truste. The treasure of this worlde we may well compare To Circes the witche, with her crafty cautilitie, Where with many mens myndes so poysoned are, That quite they are caried into all fidelitie, They are coniured in deede, and bewitched so sore, That treasure is their truste, ioye and delight, True truste is expelled they passe not therefore, And against contentation, they continually fight. But though wicked men folowe their lust, Criyng, on earth is our felicitie and pleasure, yet God doth so guide the hartes of the iuste, That they respecte chiefly the celestiall treasure. Conten. Alas should we not haue that estimation, Which God hath prepared for his dere elect, Should not our myndes reste in full contentation, Hauing truste in this treasure, most highe in respecte: S. Paule, when the Lorde so highe did erecte, Saith: it passeth the sence of our memory and mynde, Much lesse can our outward eyes the same finde. And as for treasures which men possesse here Through fickelnes of fortune, sone fadeth away, The greatest of renowme and most worthy pere, Sometime falleth, in the end to mysery and decaie, Recorde of Dionisius, a king of much fame, Of the valiaunt Alexander, and Caesar the strong, Record of Tarquini?, which Superbus had to name, And of Heliogabolos that ministred with wronge, If I should recite all, I should stande very long. But these be sufficient plainely to approue, Howe sone by vncertentie, this treasure doth remoue. Iuste. It is true, therefore a mynde well contente, Is great riches as the wyse king Salomon doth say: We haue seene of late daies this cancar pestilent Corrupting our realme, to our great decaie, Ambition I meane, whiche chiefly did raigne Among those that should be examples to other, We sawe howe their brethren they did disdaine, And burned with fire the childe with the mother, It is often seene that such monsters ambitious, As spare not to spill the bloud of the innocente, Will not greatly sticke to become seditious, The determination of God thereby to preuente: God graunt euery one of vs earnestly to repent, And not to set our mindes on this fading treasure, But rather wyshe and wil, to doe the Lordes pleasure. Truste. O ye Emperours, Pot?tates, &amp; Princes of renowne, Learne of Iust with truste your selues to associate, That like as your vocation, by right doth aske ye crown And also due obedi?ce, being ye appointed magistrate, So rule that at the laste you may be resuscitate, And raigne with ye almightie with perfect c?tinu?ce, Receiuing double crownes for your godly gouerna?ce ye noble men, whome God hath furnished with fame, Be myndefull to walke in the wayes of the Iuste, Adde vertue euermore to your honorable name, And be not ouercome of concupicence or luste, Fle from loue of Treasure, catche holde of me Truste. And then double felicitie, at the last you shall possesse, And in al earthly doings, God shal geue good succes. ye poore men &amp; commons, walke well in your vocation Banishe luste and desier, which is not conuenient, Let truste worke in you a full contentation, Considering that it leadeth to treasures more excell?t For these are vncertaine, but they are most perman?t: your necessitie supplie with vertue and truste, And then shall you enioye your crown among ye Iust. Iuste. As I being properly nominate Iuste, Am here associate with contentation, So haue I my whole felicitie in Truste, Who ilumineth mine eyes to see my saluation. Truste. Feare ye not, shortly you shall haue consolation, If I were once growen in you to perfection, Euen thus goeth it alwaies with ye children of electi? Iuste. I will departe nowe, will ye go with me truste. Truste. yea I must alwaies associate the Iuste. Conten. A psalme of thankesgeuing first let vs sing, To the laude and prayse of the immortall kinge. Here if you will: sing the man is blest that feareth God. &amp;c. Go out, Enter Inclination laughing. Incli. Lust (quod he) now in faithe he is lusty, Lady Treasure and he hath made a matche, He thinketh that I ware marueylous trusty, Because I teache him to clawe and to catche, And now a daie s amitie doth therein consiste, He that can flatter shalbe well beloued, But he that saieth, thus and thus saieth Christe, Shall as an enemy be openly reproued. Friendship, yea, friendship c?sisteth now in adulati?, Speake faire and please the lust of thy Lorde, I warrante thee be had in great estimation, When those that tell truthe, shalbe abhorde, A vnhappy lingua, whether wilt thou ren, Take hede I aduise thee, least thou be shent, If ye chaunce to tell any tales of these gentlewomen, With fleshe hokes and nayles, you are like to be rent, Nay for the passion of me, be not so moued, And I will please you incontinent againe, Aboue all treasures you are worthy to be loued, Because you do no men deride nor disdaine, You doe not contempte the simple and poore, you be not hie minded, proude and presumptuous, Neither wanton nor wyly you be neuer more, But gentle, louing, modestie, and vertuous, Beholde howe a lie can please some folkes diet, O pacifie their myndes marueilous well, All whyste I warrant ye, so they in quiet, Howe to please you hereafter now I can tell, Harke, I heare Luste and my lady Treasure. They are giuen to solace singing and pleasure. Enter Luste and Treasure a woman, finely appareled. Luste. Ah Amorous Lady of bewtifull face, Thou art hartely welcome into this place, My harte is inclined to thee lady Treasure, My loue is insatiate, it kepeth no measure. Treasur It is I maister Lust that will you aduaunce, Treasure, it is that thinges doth enhaunce Upon me set your whole affection and luste, And passe not a point for the wayes of the Iuste, Treasure is a pleasure, beare that in mynde, Both trusty and true ye shall me alwayes finde. Inclina. As trusty as is a quicke ele by the tayle, What Lady Treasure welcome without fayle, To be better acquainted with you once I truste, But I dare not in the presence of my maister Luste, ye are welcome syr hartely, what be of good courage: Drawer, let vs haue a pynte of white wyne &amp; borage. Luste. Wherefore I praye thee tell, Inclina. Mary me thinke you are not well. Luste. Not well, who can a better life craue, Then to possesse suche a lady as I haue: Is there any wealth not conteined in treasure, Ah lady, I loue thee in faith out of measure, Incli. It is out of measure in deede as you saie, And euen so most men loue her at this daie: Oh she is a mynion of amorous hewe, Her pere in my daies yet I neuer knewe, (Old quod you) I am an olde knaue I tell ye, Nay, neuer laughe at ye matter, for doubtles I smel ye She passeth Iuno, Ceres, and Pallas, More beautifull then euer dame Uenus was, Othea in sapience she doth excede, And Diana in dignitie, of whome we doe reade. What should faire Helene once named be, She excelleth all these maister Luste beleue me. Luste. Howe saye you, is not this an eloquent lad? Treasur That you haue such a seruaunt, truely I am glad. Inclina. Ha, ha, nowe in deede I can you not blame, For women of all degrees are glad of the same, They that flatter and speake them fayre, Shalbe their sonnes, and peraduenture their ayre. Luste. You tolde me of a brother you had lady Treasure. Treasur Yea syr that I haue, his name is called Pleasure, And seing you enyoye me now at your will, Right sone I am sure he will come you vntill. Luste. Truly of him I would faine haue a sight, For because yt in pleasure I haue marueilous delight. Inclina. Then honestie and profite you may bidde good night Luste. What saiest thou? Incli. I saie he will shortly appeare in sight, I knowe by his singing, the same is he, The misbegotten orpheus, I thinke that he be. Enter pleasure singing this song. O happy eaies, and pleasaunt playes, Wherein I doe delight a I doe pretende, till my liues ende To liue still in such plighte a. Inclina. Maister pleasure I perceiue you be of good chere. Pleasur What Inclination old lad, art thou here. Inclina. Yea syr, and lady Treasure your sister also. Pleasur Body of me, then vnto her I will go, What syster, I am glad to mete with you here. Treasur Welcome vnto me mine owne brother dere, Maister Luste, this is my brother of whome I tolde, He is pleasaunt and lusty, as you may beholde. Luste. Gentlem? (I pray you) is your name master Pleasure Pleasur yea syr, and I am brother to lady Treasure. Luste. And are you contented to accompanie me. Pleasur Where as she is resident I must nedes be, Treasure doth Pleasure commonly proceade, But the one is with ye other, they haue both so decreed Inclina. Mary now you are well in deede maister Luste, This is better I trowe then the life of the Iuste, They be compelled to possesse contentation, Hauing no treasure but trust of saluation, But my lady your mistris, my mistris I would saye, She worketh you may see to kepe you from decaie. Luste. O madame, in you is all my delight, And in your brother Pleasure, both daye and night, The triall of treasure this is in deede, I perceiue that she is a true frende at neede. For I haue proued her according as Thales doth saye And I perceiue that her bewtie can not decaye. Treasur Alwayes with you I wilbe resident, So that your life shalbe most excellent. Pleasur yea syr, and me Pleasure also you shall haue, So that none other thinge there nedeth to craue, I will replenishe your harte with delight, And I wilbe alwayes with treasure in sighte, But if you desire to enioye me at your will, My sister you must haue in reputation still, And then as her treasure is certaine and excellent, My pleasure shalbe both perfect and permanent, Credite not those syr that talke that and this, Saiyng, that in vs twoo consisteth no blisse, But let experience your mynde euer moue, And see if all men vs twoo doe not loue. Inclina. Loue, yes they loue you in deede without doubte, Which shutteth some of th? Gods kingdome without: They loue you so well that their God they do hate, As time hath declared to vs euen of late, But he that on such thinges his study doth caste, Shalbe sure to be deceiued at the laste. Luste. What doest thou saie. Inclina. Of treasure forsoth ye must euer holde fast, For if you should chaunce to lose lady Treasure, Then fare well in post this gentleman Pleasure. Luste. My loue to them both can not be exprest, And especially my Lady you I loue best. Treasur If ye loue me as you doe professe, Be ye sure you shall wante no kinde of welthines. Pleasur And if you haue welthines at your owne wyll, Then will I pleasure remayne with you still. Incli. You are both as constant as snowe in the sunne, Which from snow to water through melting doth run But worldly wyse men can not conceaue that, To honte for suche myse they learne of the cat. Luste. My Lady is amorous and full of fauour. Inclina. I may say to you she hath an ilfauoured sauour. Luste. What saiest thou? Inclina. I saye she is louing and of gentle behauiour. Treasur And so I will continue still be you sure. Pleasur And I in like case whyle your life doth endure, Luste. Ah truste treasure, ah pleasaunt pleasure, All wealth I possesse nowe without measure, And seing that the same shall firmely remayne, To helpe me singe a songe, will you take the paine. Treasur Euen with all my harte beginne whan ye will. Incli. To it, and I will either helpe or stand still. Singe this songe. Am not I in blissed case Treasure and pleasure to possesse, I would not wishe no better place, If I may still haue welthines, And to enioye in perfect peace, My lady lady. My pleasaunt pleasure shall encrease My deare lady. Helene may not compared be, Nor Creseda that was so bright, These can not staine the shine of thee Nor yet Minerua of great might, Thou passest Uenus farre away, Lady lady, Loue thee I will both night and day My dere lady. My mouse my nobs and cony swete My hope and ioye my whole delight, Dame nature may fall at thy feete, And may yelde to thee her crowne of righte I will thy body nowe embrace, Lady, lady And kisse thy swete and pleasaunt face, My dere lady. Enter Gods visitation. Uisita. I am God minister called Uisitation, Which diuers and many waies you may vnderstande Sometime I bring sicknes, sometime perturbation, Sometime trouble and misery throughout the lande, Sometime I signifie gods wrath to be at hande, Sometime a foreronner of distruction imminent, But an exectuter of paine I am at this present, Thou insipient foole that hast folowed thy luste, Disdaining the doctrine declared by Sapience, In treasure and pleasure hath bene thy truste, Which yu thoughtest should remaine euer in thy pres?ce Thou neuer remembrest Thales his sentence, Who willeth men in all thinges to kepe a measure, Especially in loue to incertaintie of treasure, Euen nowe I am come from visiting the Iust, Because God beginneth first with his elect, But he is so associate and comforted with truste, That no kinde of impacience his soule can infecte, Contentation in suche sorte his race doth directe, That he is contented with Gods operation, Comfortably embracing me his visitation. But nowe I am come to vexe thee with paine, Which makest treasure thy castell and rocke, Thou shalt knowe that both she and pleasure is vain, And that the almighty thou canst not mocke, Anguishe and griefe into thee I doe caste, With paine in thy members continually, Now thou hast paine thy pleasure can not laste, But I will expelle him incontinently. Luste. O cockes harte, what a pestilence is this, Departe from me I saye, hence gods Uisitation, Helpe, helpe, lady treasure thou goddes of blis, At thy handes let me haue some consolation. Treasur I will remaine with you be out of doubte. Incli. Will ye be packing you ilfauoured lowte. Uisita. Presently in dede from him thou shalt not go, And why? because Gods will hath not determined so. But in time thou treasure shalt be turned to ruste, And as for pleasure he shall nowe attend on the Iust. Luste. Gogs woundes these panges encrease euer more. Inclina. And my littell finger is spitefully sore, you will not beleue how my hele doth ake, Treasur [to Uisitati?] Nay let me alone your part I will take, Uisita. [to Lust.] Be of good comforte whyle I here remaine. For pleasure and he shalbe parted in twaine, It is not mete that he should be participate with lust But rather with the vertuous godly and Iuste. Luste. Remaine with me still maister pleasure I say. Pleasur Nay there is no remedy I must away, For where God doth sende punition and paine, I pleasure in no case can not remaine. Uisita. I could in like case separate thy treasure, But God doth admonishe thee by losing thy pleasure. Go out Uisitation and Pleasure, Inclina. Fare well in the deuils name olde lousy loute, That my maister will die I stand in great doubte, Ho, ho, ho, howe is it with you maister Luste, Luste. By the fleshe of Goliah, yet Treasure is my truste, Though pleasure be gone, and I liue in paine, I doubt not but Treasure will fetche him againe. Treasur Yea, that I will feare not &amp; with you remayne. Inclina. The propertie of riche men vndoubtedly he hath, Whiche thinke with monie to pacifie Gods wrath, And health at their pleasure to bye and to sell, Howe is it maister Luste, are you any thing well. Luste. Against this Uisitation my harte doth rebell, Gogs woundes, shall I still in these panges remaine. Treasur Feare you not maister Lust, I wil helpe you againe Treasure in phisicke exceadeth Gallenus, Tushe there is no phisition but we shall haue with vs. To the ease of your body they will you bringe, And therefore I praie you dispaire in nothing, Put your trust alwayes in me lady treasure, And I will restore you againe vnto pleasure, For I am the Goddes that therein hath power, Which shall remaine perfect vnto the last houre. Inclina. Yea, yea, maister Luste, be as mery as you may, Let Treasure be your truste who so euer say nay. Enter tyme. Time. The auncient Grekes haue called me Chronos, Whiche in our vulgar tongue signifieth time. I am entred in presently for a certainly purpose, Euen to turne treasure to ruste and to slime, And Luste which hath long disdained the Iuste, Ensuing his filthy and vyle inclination, Shall immediatly be turned to duste, To the example of all the whole congregation, For time bringeth both these matters to passe, As experience hath taught in euery age, And you shall beholde the same in this glasse, As a document both profitable and sage, Both Lust and treasure come foorth with spede Into the shop of the most mighty God, There shall you be beaten to pouder in dede, And for your abusion, fele his scourge and rod. Incli. By saint Mary, then they haue made a wise matche, I pretende therefore to leape ouer the hatche, Nay let me departe, syrs stop me not I saye, For I must remayne though both these decaye. Go out, Luste. Luste from the beginning frequented hath bene And shall I now turne to nothing for thee. Treasur Treasure in all ages hath bene beloued, And shall she from the earth by thee be remoued. Time. You know that all suche thinges are subiect to time Therefore me to withstande is no reason nor ryme, For like as all thinges in time their beginning had, So must all thinges in time vanishe and fade. Luste. Gogs woundes, let Treasure remaine stil with me, Treasur Yea let me continue still in my dignitie. Time. Nay, I must cary you into Uulcans fire, Where you shalbe tried vnto the vttermoste, Seing Lust against Iust did daily conspier, To dust he shall turne for all his great boaste, Both of you shall haue one rigorous hoaste, Come therefore with spede time can not tary, To the ende of your felicitie I will you carie. Treasur If there be no remedy then there is no shifte, Luste. He must nedes go that is driuen by the Deuils drifte, A cocks precious sydes, what fortune is this, Whether go I nowe, to misery or blis. Go out. Enter Iuste, leading Inclination in his bridle shakled. Inclina We, he, he, he, he, ware the horse heles I saye, I would the raine ware lose that I might run away. Iuste. Nay sithe thou wilt not spare against me to rebell, I will not spare by Gods grace thee to brydell, All men may see howe vile Inclination, Spareth not to put the Iust to vexation, Euen so may all men learne of me againe, Thy beastly desiers to bridle and restraine. Inclina. Mary syr I am bridled in deede as you saye, And shakled I thinke for running awaye, This snafle is sharpe indeede for the nones, And these shakkels doe chafe my legges to the bones, And yet will I prouoke spurne and pricke, Rebell repugne lashe out and kicke, We he, in the Iades name are ye so freshe, This gere I suppose will plucke downe your fleshe. Iuste. Nay softe, thou shalt haue a litle more paine, For somewhat shorter nowe I will tie thy rayne. Enter Trust and Consolation. Truste. Moste blissed and happie I saye are the Iuste, Euen because they restraine their owne Inclination, Thou therefore that hast made thy treasure of truste, Beholde, I haue brought thee here consolation. Iuste. Nowe blyssed be God of his mercy and grace, With all my harte and soule I doe you embrace. Conso. Consolation is my name euen as Trust hath saide, Which is ioye or comfort in this life transitorie, He that possesseth me, is of nothing afraide, But hath a moste quiet and peaciable memorie, For I through trust doth shewe thee the glorie, That God hath prepared for them before hande, Wherein at the last they shall perfectly stande. Truste. Receiue this croune of felicitie nowe at this space, Which shalbe made richer in the celestiall place. Incli. Byr lady, I would I had such a gaye croune. Iuste. Nowe praysed be God for this riches of renoune Felicitie in this worlde the Iust doe enioye, Namely when the Deuill can them not anoye, The Lordes worke this is, who be praysed for euer, who graunte vs in his lawes still to perseuer. Conso. Amen, amen, God gyue vs delighte, In his holy couenaunt both daye and night. Truste. Our matter is almost brought to an ende, Sauing that Inclination in prison must be shut, Iuste carie him forth that vseth to contende, And see that surely enough he be put. Iuste. That shalbe done shortely by gods grace. Inclina. What softe I saye, me thinke ye go a shamefull pace, Was there euer poore colte thus handled before, Fie vpon it, my legges be onreasonablye sore, Well yet I will rebell, yea, and rebell againe, And though a thousand times, yu shouldest me restrain. Leade him out. Enter time with a similitude of dust, and rust, Time. Beholde here howe Luste is conuerted to duste, This is his Image, his wealth and prosperitie, And Treasure in like case is turned to ruste, Whereof this example sheweth the veritie. The triall of Treasure this is no doubte, Let all men take hede that truste in the same, Considering what thinges I tyme bringe aboute, And quenche out the vngodly their memory and fame. Enter Iuste. Iuste. Why, and is Lust and treasure conuerted to this. Time. yea forsothe. Iuste. What foolishe man in them would put truste, If this be the finall end of their blisse, Muche better I commende the life of the Iuste. Conso. So it is no doubte, for they haue consolation, Possessing felicitie euen in this place, I meane through Truste and hope of saluation, Whiche setteth out vnto vs gods mercy and grace. Truste. Let all men consider this good erudition, And not to put confidence in Luste nor Treasure, By these two examples receiue admonition, And also of the sodaine vanishement of pleasure. Time, Remember that time turneth all thinges about, Time is the touchestone the Iuste for to trie, But where as lust &amp; treasur in time is come to nought Iust possessing Trust, remayneth constantly, So that as I Time hath reuealed their infamie, So haue I shewed the Consolation and gaine, That the Iuste shall receiue that iustly doe raigne. Conso. We will nowe no lenger trouble this audience, Sythe somewhat tedious to you we haue bene, Beseching you to beare all thinges with pacience, And remember the examples that you haue seene, God graunte them to florishe liuely and grene, That some of vs the better therefore may be. Amen, Amen, I beseche the blyssed trinitie. Finis.</field>

Learne of them alwayes to obey The Lordes preceptes from daye to daye. That thou maiest walke as he doth wyll, And labour thay fonde affectes to kill. Alwayes subdue thy beastly luste, And in the Lorde put hope and truste, Bridle thine inclination By godly conuersation. The counsell of the wyse embrace, The fooles aduise doe then deface. Watche fast and praie with good delight, That Adam may be killed quite. That ioy in us may still encrease, That God the Lorde may giue his peace, That we may be content with Truste, To haue our crowne among the Just. Finis.</field>
