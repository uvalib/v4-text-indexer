      <field name="fulltext">THE SPANISH CURAT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Scæna Prima. Enter Angelo, Milanes, Arsenio. Arsenio. Leandro paid all. Mil. 'Tis his usuall custome, And requisite he should: he has now put off The Funerall black, (your rich heirs weares with joy, When he pretends to weep for his dead Father,) Your gathering Sires, so long heape muck together, That their kind Sonnes, to rid them of their care Wish them in heaven; Or if they take a taste Of Purgatory by the way, it matters not: Provided they remove hence; What is befalne To his Father, in the other world, I ask not, I am sure his prayre is heard: would I could use one For mine, in the same method. Arsen. Fy upon thee. This is prophane, Mil. Good Doctor, doe not schoole me, For a fault you are not free from: On my life Were all Heires in Corduba, put too their oathes They would confesse with me, 'tis a sound Tenet: I am sure Leandro do's. Ars. He is th'owner Of a faire Estate. Mil. And fairly he deserves it, He's a royall Fellow: yet observes a meane In all his courses, carefull to on whom He showres his bounties: he that's liberall To all alike, may doe a Good by chance, But never out of Judgement: This invites The prime men of the Citie to frequent All places he resorts to, and are happy In his sweet Converse. Ars. Don Jamie the Brother To the Grandee Don Henrique, appeares much taken With his behaviour. Mil. There is something more in't: Hee needs his Purse, and knowes how to make use on't, 'Tis now in fashion for your Don, that's poore, To vow all Leagues of friendship with a Merchant That can supply his wants, and howsoe're Don Jamie's noble borne, his elder Brother Don Henrique rich, and his Revenues long since Encreasing by marrying with a wealthy Heire Call'd Madam Violante, he yet holds A hard hand o're Jamie, allowing him A bare annuity onely. Ars. Yet 'tis said He hath no child, and by the Lawes of Spaine If he die without issue, Don Iamie Inherits his Estate. Mil. Why that's the reason Of their so many jarres: Though the young Lord Be sick of the elder Brother, and in reason Should flatter, and observe him, he's of a nature Too bold, and fierce, to stoop so, but beares up, Presuming on his hopes. Ars. What's the young Lad That all of 'em make so much of? Mil. 'Tis a sweet-One, And the best condition'd youth, I ever saw yet, So humble and so affable, that he wins The love of all that know him, and so modest, That (in despight of povertie) he would starve Rather then aske a courtesie; He's the Sonne Of a poore cast-Captaine, one Octavio And She, that once was calld th'faire Iacinta, Is happy in being his Mother: for his sake. Enter Jamie, Leandro, and Ascanio. (Though in their Fortunes falne) they are esteem'd of, And cherish'd by the best. O here they come, I now may spare his Character, but observe him, Hee'l justifie my report. Ia. My good Ascanio Repaire more often to me: above Women Thou ever shalt be welcome. Asc. My Lord your favours May quickly teach a raw untutour'd Youth To be both rude and sawcie. Leandro. You cannot be Too frequent, where you are so much desir'd: And give me leave (deare friend) to be your Rivall In part of his Affection; I will buy it At any rate. Ia. Stood I but now possess'd Of what my future hope presages to me, I then would make it cleare thou hadst a Patron That would not say but do: yet as I am, Be mine, I'le not receive thee as a servant, But as my Son (and though I want my self) No Page attending in the Court of Spain Shall find a kinder master. Ars. I beseech you That my refusall of so great an offer May make no ill construction, 'tis not pride (That common vice is farre from my condition) That makes you a denyall to receive A favour I should sue for: nor the fashion Which the country followes, in which to be a servant In those that groan beneath the heavy weight Of povertie is held an argument Of a base and abject mind, I wish my yeares Were fit to do you service in a nature That might become a Gentleman (give me leave To think my self one) My father serv'd the King As a Captain in the field; and though his fortune Return'd him home a poore man, he was rich In reputation, and wounds fairly taken. Nor am I by his ill successe deterr'd, I rather feel a strong desire that swayes me To follow his Profession, and if heaven Hath marked me out to be a man, how proud, In the service of my Country, should I be, To traile a pike under your brave command. There, I would follow you as a guid to honour, Though all the horrours of the Warre made up To stop my passage. Ia. Thou art a hopefull Boye, And it was bravely spoken: For this answer, I love thee more then ever. Mil. Pitty such seeds Of promising courage should not grow and prosper Ang. What ever his reputed Parents bee, He hath a mind that speakes him right and noble. Lea. You make him blush: it needs not sweet Ascanio, We may heare praises when they are deserv'd, Or modestie unwounded. By my life I would adde something to the building up So fair a mind, and if till you are fit To beare Armes in the field, you'l spend some yeares In Salamanca, I'le supply your studies With all conveniences. Ars. Your goodnesse (Signiors) And charitable favours overwhelm me. If I were of your blood, you could not be More tender of me: what then can I pay (A poore boy and a stranger) but a heart Bound to your service? with what willingnes I would receive (good Sir) your noble offer, Heaven can beare witnes for me: but alas Should I embrace the meanes to raise my fortunes, I must destroy the lives of my poore Parents (To whom I ow my being) they in me Place all their comforts, and (as if I were The light of their dim eyes) are so indulgent They cannot brook one short dayes absence from me; And (what will hardly win belief) though young, I am their steward and their nurse: the bounties VVhich others bestow on me serves to sustain 'em, And to forsake them in their age, in me VVere more then murther. Enter Henrique. Ang. This is a kind of begging VVould make a Broker charitable, Mil. Here (sweet heart) I wish that it were more. Lean. VVhen this is spent, Seek for supply from me Ja. Thy pietie For ever be remembred: nay take all, Though 'twere my exhibition to a Royall For one whole yeare. Asc. High heavens reward your goodnes. Hen. So Sir, is this a slip of your own grafting, You are so prodigall? Ia. A slip Sir? Hen. Yes, A slip; or call it by the proper name Your Bastard. Ia. You are foul-mouth'd; do not provoke me, I shall forget your Birth, if you proceed, And use you, (as your manners do deserve) uncivilly. Hen. So brave? pray you give me hearing, Who am I Sir? Ia. My elder Brother: One That might have been born a fool and so reputed, But that you had the luck to creep into The world a yeare before me. Lean. Be more temperate. Ia. I neither can nor will, unlesse I learn it By this example: let him use his harsh Unsavoury reprehensions upon those That are his hinds, and not on me. The Land Our father left to him alone rewards him, For being twelve moneths elder, let that be Forgotten, and let his Parasites remember One quality of worth or vertue in him That may authorise him, to be a censurer Of me, or of my manners, and I will Acknowledge him for a tutor, til then, never Hen. From whom have you your meanes Sir? Ia. From the will Of my dead father; I am sure I spend not Nor give't upon your purse. Hen. But will it hold out Without my help? Ja. I am sure it shall I'le sink else For sooner I will seek aid from a whore, Then a courtesie from you. Hen. 'Tis well; you are proud of Your new Exchequer when you have cheated him And worn him to the quick, I may be found In the List of your acquaintance Lea. Pray you hold And give me leave (my Lord) to say thus much (And in mine own defence) I am no Gull To be wrought on by perswasion: nor no Coward To be beaten out of my meanes, but know to whom And why I give or lend; and will do nothing But what my reason warrants; you may be As sparing as you please, I must be bold To make use of mine own, without your licence. Ia. 'Pray thee let him alone, he is not worth thy anger All that he do's (Leandro) is for my good, I think there's not a Gentleman of Spain, That ha's a better steward, then I have of him. Hen. Your steward Sir? Ja. Yes, and a provident one: Why, he knowes I am given to large Expence, And therefore layes up for me: could you believe els That he, that sixteen years hath worne the yoke Of barren wedlock, without hope of issue, (His Coffer's full, his Lands, and Vineyards fruitfull) Could be so sold to base, and sordid thrift, As almost to deny himselfe, the meanes And necessaries of life? Alas, he knowes The Lawes of Spaine appoint me for his heire, That all must come to me, if I out-live him, (Which sure I must doe, by the course of Nature,) And the assistance of good Mirth, and Seck, How ever you prove Melancholy. Hen. If I live, Thou dearly shalt repent this, Ja. When thou art dead, I am sure I shall not. Mil. Now they begin to burn Like oppos'd Meteors. Ars. Give them line, and way, My life for Don Jamie. Ja. Continue still The excellent Husband, and joyne Farme to Farme, Suffer no Lordship, that in a cleare day Falls in the prospect of your coveteous eye To be an others; Forget you are a Grandee Take use upon use, and cut the throats of heires With cozening Mort-gages: rack your poore Tenants, Till they looke like so many Skeletons For want of Food; And when that Widowes curses, The ruines of ancient Families, teares of Orphans Have hurried you to the divell. ever remember All was rak'd up, for me, (your thankfull Brother) That will dance merrily upon your Grave, And perhaps give a double Pistolet To some poore needy Frier, to say a Masse To keep your Ghost from walking. Hen. That the Law Should force me to endure this! Ia. Verely, When this shall come to passe (as sure it will) If you can find a loope-hole, though in hell' To looke on my behaviour, you shall see me Ransack your Iron Chests, and once againe Pluto's flame-colour'd Daughter shall be free To dominier in Taverns, Maskes, and Revells As she was us'd before she was your Captive. Me thinkes the meere conceipt of it, should make you Goe home sick and distemper'd, if it do's. I'le send you a Doctor of mine owne, and after Take order for your Funerall. Hen. You have said, sir, I will not fight with words, but deeds to tame you, Rest confident I will, and thou shalt wish This day thou hadst been dumb.— Exit. Mil. You have given him a heat. But with your owne distemper. Ia. Not a whit Now he is from mine eye, I can be merry, Forget the cause, and him: all plagues goe with him, Let's talke of something els: what newes is stirring? Nothing to passe the time? Mil. 'Faith, it is said That the next Summer will determine much Of that we long have talk'd of, touching the Wars. Lea. What have we to doe with them? Let us discourse Of what concernes our selves. 'Tis now in fashion To have you Gallants set downe, in a Taverne, Whatthe Arch-Dukes purpose is the next spring, &amp; what Defence my Lords (the States) prepare: what course The Emperour takes against the encroching Turke, And whither his Moony-Standards are design'd For Persia or Polonia: and all this The wiser sort of State-Wormes seeme to know Better then their owne Affaires: this is discourse Fit for the Counsell it concernes; we are young, And if that I might give the Theame, 'twere better To talke of handsome women. Mil. And that's one, Almost as generall. Ars. Yet none agree Who are the fairest. Lea. Some prefer the French, For their conceited Dressings: some the plump Italian Bona-Robas, some the State That ours observe; and I have heard one sweare, (A merry friend of mine) that once in London, He did enjoy the company of a Gamester, (A common Gamester too) that in one night Met him th'Italian, French, and Spanish waies, And ended in the Dutch; for, to coole her selfe, She kiss'd him drunke in the morning. Ia. Wee may spare The travell of our tongues in forraigne Nations, When in Corduba, if you dare give credit To my report (for I have seene her, Gallants) There lives a woman) of a meane birth too, And meanly match'd) whose all-excelling Forme Disdaines comparison with any She That puts in for a faire one, and though you borrow From every Country of the Earth the best Of those perfections, which the Clymat yeilds To help to make her up, if put in Ballance, This will weigh-downe the Scale. Lea. You talke of wonders. Ia. She is indeed a wonder, and so kept, And, as the world deserv'd not to behold What curious Nature made without a patterne, Whose Copy she hath lost too, she's shut up, Sequestred from the world. Lea. Who is the owner Of such a Jem? I am fir'd. Ia. One Bartolus, A wrangling Advocate. Ars. A knave on Record. Mil. I am sure he cheated me of the best part Of my Estate. Ia. Some Businesse calls me hence, (And of importance) which denies me leisure To give you his full character: In few words (Though rich) he's covetous beyond expression, And to encrease his heape, will dare the Divell, And all the plagues of darknesse: and to these So jealous, as if you would paralell Old Argus to him, you must multiply His Eies an hundred times: of these, none sleepe. He that would charme the heaviest lid, must hire A better Mercurie; then Iove made use of: Blesse your selves from the thought of him and her. For 'twill be labour lost: So farewell Signiors.— Exit. Ars. Leandro? in a dreame? wake man for shame. Mil. Trayned into a fooles paradise with a tale Of an imagin'd Forme, Lea. Iamie is noble, And with a forg'd Tale would not wrong his Friend, Nor am I so much fired with lust as Envie, That such a churl as Bartolus should reap So sweet a harvest, half my State to any To help me to a share. Ars. Tush do not hope for Impossibilities, Lea. I must enjoy her, And my prophetique love tells me I shall, Lend me but your assistance; Ars. Give it 'ore, Mil. I would not have thee fool'd Lea. I have strange Engines, Fashioning here: and Bartolus on the Anville Diswade me not, but help me, Mil. Take your fortune, If you come off well; praise your wit, if not, Expect to be the subject of our Laughter. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Octavio, and Iacinta. Iac. You met Don Henrique. Oct. Yes: Iac. What comfort bring you? Speake cheerefully: how did my Letter worke? On his hard temper? I am sure I wrot it, So feelingly, and with the pen of sorrow, That it must force Compunction, Oct. You are cozen'd; Can you with one hand prop a falling Tower? Or with the other stop the raging maine, When it breakes in on the usurped Shore? Or any thing that is impossible? And then conclude that there is some way left, To move him to compassion. Iac. Is there a Justice Or thunder (my Octavio) and he Not sunk unto the center? Oct. Good Iacinta. With your long practised patience beare afflictions, And by provoking it call not on Heavens anger, He did not onely scorne to read your Letter, But (most inhumane as he is) he cursed you, Cursed you most bitterly, Iac. The bad mans charity, Oh that I could forget there were a Tye, In me, upon him! or the releife I seeke, (If given) were bounty in him, and not debt, Debt of a deere accompt! Oct. Touch not that string, 'Twill but encrease your Sorrow, and tame silence, (The Balme of the oppressed) which hitherto Hath eas'd your grieved soule, and preserv'd your fame, Must be your Surgeon still. Iac. If the contagion Of my misfortunes had not spread it self, Upon my Son Ascanio, though my wants Were centupli'd upon my self, I could be patient: But he is so good, I so miserable, His pious care his dutie, and obedience, And all that can be wish'd for from a Son, Discharg'd to me, and I, bard of all meanes, To returne any scruple of the debt I owe him as a Mother, is a Torment, Too painefull to be borne. Oct. I suffer with you, In that; yet find in this assurance comfort, High heaven ordaines (whose purposes cannot alter) Enter Ascanio. Children that pay obedience to their Parents, Shall never beg their Bread. Iac. Here comes our joy, Where has my dearest been? Asc. I have made (Mother) A fortunate voyage and brought home rich prize, In a few houres: the owners too contented, From whom I tooke it. See heres Gold, good store too Nay, pray you take it, Iac. Mens Charities are so cold, That if I knew not, thou wert made of Goodnes, 'Twould breed a jealousie in me by what meanes, Thou cam'st by such a sum Asc. Were it ill got, I am sure it could not be employed so well, As to relieve your wants. Some noble Friends, (Rais'd by heavens mercy to me, not my merits) Bestow'd it on me. Oct. It were a sacriledge To rob thee of their bounty, since they gave it, To thy use onely; Iac. Buy thee brave Cloathes with it And fit thee for a fortune, and leave us, To our necessities; why do'st thou weep? Asc. Out of my feare, I have offended you; For had I not, I am sure you are too kind, Not to accept the offer of my service, In which I am a gainer; I have heard My tutor say of all aiereall foule The Storke's the Embleme of true pietie, Because when age hath seiz'd upon her dam, And made unfit for flight, the gratefull young one Takes her upon his back, provides her foode, Repaying so, her tender care of him, 'Ere he was fit to fly, by bearing her: Shall I then that have reason, and discourse That tell me all I can doe is too litle, Be more unnaturall then a silly Bird? Or feed or cloth my selfe superfluously, And know, nay see you want? holy Saints keepe me. Iac. Can I be wretched, And know my selfe the Mother to such Goodnes? Oct. Come, let us drie our eyes, wee'll have a Feast, Thanks to our little Steward; Iac. And in him, Beleeve that we are rich. Asc. I am sure I am, While I have power to comfort you, and serve you. Exeunt. Scæna Tertia. Enter Henrique and Violante. Viol. Is it my fault (Don Henrique) or my fate, What's my offence? I came young to your Bed I had a fruitfull Mother and you met me, With equall ardour in your May of blood; And why then am I barren? Hen. 'Tis not in Man To yield a reason for the will of Heaven; Which is inscrutable. Viol. To what use serve Full fortunes, and the meaner sort of Blessings, When that, which is the Crowne of all our wishes, The period of humane happines, One only Child that may possesse what's ours, Is cruelly denide us? Hen. 'Tis the curse, Of great Estates to want those Pledges which, The poore are happy in: They in a Cottage, With joy, behold the Modells of their youth, And as their Roote decaies those budding Branches, Sprout forth and flourish, to renew their age; But this is the beginning, not the end To me, of, that misery against my will, (Since Heaven denies us Issue of our owne) Must leave the fruit of all my care and travell To an unthankfull Brother that insults, On my Calamity. Viol. I will rather choose, A Bastard from the Hospitall and adopt him, And nourish him, as mine owne. Hen. Such an evasion (My Violante) is forbid to us; Happy the Romane State, where it was lawfull, (If our owne Sonnes were vicious) to choose one Out of a vertuous Stock, though of poore Parents, And make him noble. But the Lawes of Spaine, (Intending to preserve all ancient Houses) Prevent such free elections; with this my Brothers Too well acquainted, and this makes him bold to Reigne 'ore me, as a Master, Viol. I will fire The Portion I brought with me, 'ere he spend, A Royall of it: No Quirck left? no Quiddit That may defeate him? Hen. Were I but confirmed, That you would take the meanes I use, with patience, As I must practise it with my dishonour, I could lay levell with the earth his hopes That soare above the clouds with expectation To see me in my grave. Viol. Effect but this And our revenge shall be to us a Son That shall inherit for us. Hen. Do not repent When 'tis too late. Viol. I feare not what may fall He disposess'd that doe's usurpe on all Exeunt.</field>

Wonder on, I am as ye see, and what will follow Gentlemen Ars. Why dost thou put on this form? what can this do? Thou lookest most sillily. Mil. Like a young Clerk A half pin'd-puppy that would write for a Royall. Is this a commanding shape to win a Beautie? To what use, what occasion? Lean. Peace ye are fooles, More silly then my out-side seems ye are ignorant They that pretend to wonders must weave cunningly. Ars. What manner of accesse can this get? or if gotten What credit in her eyes? Lean. Will ye but leave me? Mil. Me thinks a yong man, and a handsom Gentleman (But sure thou art lunatick) me thinks a brave man That would catch cunningly the beames of Beautie, And so distribute 'em, unto his comfort, Should like himself appeare, young, high, and buxom. And in the brightest form. Lean. Ye are cozen'd (Gentlemen) Neither doe I believe this, nor will follow it, Thus I am, I will begin my voyage, When you love, lanch it out in silks and velvets, Ile love in Serge, and will outgo your Sattins To get upon my great horse and appeare. The signe of such a man, and trot my measures, Or fiddle out whole frosty nights (my friends) Vnder the window, while my teeth keep tune, I hold no handsomnesse. Let me get in There trot and fiddle where I may have faire play, Ars. But how get in? Lean. Leave that to me, your patience, I have some toyes here that I dare well trust to: I have smelt a Vicar out, they call him Lopez. You are ne're the nearer now, Mil. We do confesse it. Lean. Weak simple men, this Vicar to this Lawyer Is the most inward, Damon. Ars. What can this do? Mil. We know the fellow, and he dwells there. Lean. So. Ars. A poore, thin theef: he help? he; hang the Vicar Can reading of an—preferre thee? Lean. Thou art dead-sick in love, and hee'l pray for thee Have patience (Gentlemen) I say this Vicar, This thing I say is all one with the Close Bartolus (For so they call the Lawyer) or his nature Which I have studied by relation; And make no doubt I shall hit hansomly, Will I work cunningly and home: understand me. Enter Lopez and Diego. Next I pray leave me, Leave me to my fortune Difficilia pulchra, thats my Motto (Gentlemen) I'le win this Diamond from the rock and weare her Or— Mil. Peace, the Vicar: send ye a full sail, Sir. Ars. There's your Confessor, but what shal be your pennance? exit lea. A fools head if I fail and so forsake me. You shall heare from me daily. Mil. We will be ready, Lop. Thin world indeed: Lean. I'le let him breathe and mark him: No man would think a stranger as I am Should reap any great commodity from his pigbelly, Lop. Poore stirring for poore Vicars, Diego. And poore Sextons. Lop. We pray and pray, but to no purpose Those that enjoy our Lands, choak our Devotions. Our poore thin stipends make us arrant dunces, Diego. If you live miserably, how shall we do (Master?) That are fed onely with the sound of prayers? We rise and ring the Bells to get good stomacks. And must be fain to eat the ropes with reverence, Lop. When was there a Christning (Diego?) Dieg. Not this ten weekes: Alas, they have forgot to get children (Master) The Warres, the Seas, and usurie undoe us, Takes off our minds, our edges, blunts our plough-shares, They eat nothing here, but herbs, &amp; get nothing but green sauce: There are some poore Labourers, that perhaps Once in seven yeare, with helping one another, Produce some few pind—Butter—prints, that scarce hold The christning neither. Lop. Your Gallants, they get Honour, A strange fantasticall Birth, to defraud the Vicar, And the Camp Christens their Issues, or the Curtizans, 'Tis a lewd time. Die. They are so hard-hearted here too. They will not dye, there's nothing got by Burialls. Lop. Diego, the Ayre's too pure, they cannot perish: To have a thin Stipend, and an everlasting Parish, Lord what a torment 'tis! Die. Good sensible Master, You are allow'd to pray against all weathers, (Both foule, and faire, as you shall find occasion) Why not against all ayres? Lop. That's not i'th' Canons, I would it had, 'tis out of our way forty pence. Di. 'Tis strange, they are starv'd too yet they wil not die here, They will not Earth: a good stout plague amongst 'um, Or halfe a dozen new fantasticall Fevers That would turne up their heeles by whole-sale (Master) And take the Doctors too, in their grave Counsells, That there might be no naturall help for money; How merrily would my Bells goe then? Lop. Peace Diego The Doctors are our friends, let's please them well, For though they kill but slow, they are certaine (Diego) We must remove into a muddy Ayre, A most contagious Clymat. Die. We must certaine, An ayre that is the nursery of Agues, Such Agues (Master) that will shake mens soules out, Ne're stay for Possets, nor good old wives plaisters. Lop. Gowts and dead Palsies. Die. The dead doe's well at all times, Yet Gowts will hang an arsse a long time (Master) The Pox, or English Surfets if we had 'em; Those are rich Marle, they make a Church-yard fat, And make the Sexton sing, they never misse, Sir. Lop. Then Wills and Funerall Sermons come in season, And Feasts that makes us frolicke. Die. Would I could see 'em. Lop. And though I weepe i'th' Pulpit for my Brother, Yet (Diego) here I laugh. Di. The cause requires it. Lop. Since people left to die I am dunce (Diego). Die. 'Tis a strange thing, I have forgot to dig too. Lea. A pretious pair of youths; I must make toward 'em Lop. Who's that? look out it seemes he would speak to us. I hope a Marriage or some Wil to make (Diego.) Dieg. My friend your businesse? Lea. 'Tis to that grave Gentleman; Blesse your good learning (Sir) Lop. And blesse you also, He beares a promising face, there's some hope toward. Lea. I have a Letter to your worship. Lop. Well Sir, From whence I pray you? Lea. From Nova Hispania, Sir, And from an ancient friend of yours. Lop. 'Tis well (Sir) 'Tis very well: the divell a-one I know there. Die. Take heed of a Snap (Sir) has a cozening countenance, I doe not like his way. Lop. Let him goe forward. Cantabit Uacuus, They that have nothing, feare nothing, All I have to loose (Diego) is my learning, And when he has gotten that, he may put it in a Nut shell, Letter Read. Signior Lopez, Since my arrivall from Cordova to these parts, I have written divers Letters unto you but as yet received no Answer of any (Good: and very good) And although so great a forgetfulnesse might cause a want in my due correspondence yet the desire I have still to serve you must more prevaile with me (Better and better: the divell a man know I yet) and therefore with the present occasion offered I am willing to crave a continuance of the favours, which I have heretofore received from you and doe recommend my Son Leandro the Bearer to you with request that he may be admitted in that Universitie till such time as I shall arive at home; his studies he will make you acquainted withall: This kindnesse shall supply the want of your slacknesse: And so heaven keep you. Yours Alonzo Tiveria. Alonzo Tiveria very well, A very ancient friend of mine, I take it, For till this houre I never heard his Name, yet. Lea. You looke (Sir) as if ye had forgot my Father. Lop. No, no, I look as I would remember him. For that I never remembred, I cannot forget (Sir) Alonzo Tiveria. Lea. The same (Sir.) Lop. And now i'th' Indies? Lea. Yes. Lop. He may be any where, For ought that I consider. Lea. Thinke againe (Sir) You were Students both at one time in Salamanca, And, as I take it, Chamber-fellowes. Lop. Ha? Lea. Nay, sure you must remember. Lop. Would I could. Lea. I have heard him say, you were Gossips too. Lop. Very likely, You did not heare him say, to whom? for we Students May often-times over-reach our memories, Do'st thou remember (Diego) this same Signiour? Thou hast been mine these twenty yeares. Di. Remember? Why, this Fellow would make ye mad: Nova Hispania? And Signiour Tiveria? what are these? He may as well name ye Friends out of Cataya Take heed I beseech your worship: doe you heare, (my friend?) You have no Letters for me? Lea. Not any Letter, But I was charged to doe my Fathers love To the old honest Sexton Diego; are you he (Sir?) Di. Ha? have I friends, and know 'em not? my name is Diego, Or Nova Hispania (I was never there Sir) Or any kindred that you have—for heaven-sake, Master, Let's cast about a little, and consider, We may dreame out our time. Lea. It seemes I am deceiv'd (Sir) Yet, that you are Don Lopez, all men tell me, The Curat here, and have bin some time (sir) And you the Sexton Diego, such I am sent too, The Letter tells as much: may be they are dead, And you of the like names succeed: I thank ye gentlemen, Ye have done honestly, in telling truth, I might have bin forward els. For that Lopez. That was my Fathers friend, I had a charge, (A charge of Money) to deliver (Gentlemen) Five hundred Duckets, a poore small gratuity, But since you are not he, good sir, let me thinke, I pray ye be patient. Lop. Pray ye stay a little, Nay, let me remember, I beseech ye stay, Sir. Die. An honest noble friend, that sends so lovingly; An old friend too; I shall remember sure, Sir. Lop. Thou sayst true Diego. Di. 'Pray ye consider quickly, Doe, doe, by any meanes, me thinkes already A grave staid gentleman comes to my memory. Lea. He's old indeed, sir. Di. With a goodly white Beard, (For now he must be so: I know he must be) Signior Alonzo, (Master.) Lop. I begin to have him. Di. 'Has bin from hence, about some twenty years (sir.) Lea. Som five and twenty (sir.) Di. You say most true (sir) Just to an houre; 'tis now just five and twenty, A fine straite timber'd man, and a brave souldier, He married: let me see,— Lea. De Castro's Daughter. Di. The very same. Lea. Thou art a very Rascall, De Castro is the Turke to thee, or any thing: The Money rubbs 'em into strange remembrances, For as many Duckets more they wou'd remember Adam. Lop. Give me your hand, you are welcome to your countrey, Now I remember plainly, manifestly, As freshly, as if yesterday I had seene him, Most heartily welcome, sinfull that I am, Most sinfull man, why should I loose this Gentleman? This loving old Companion? we had all one soule, sir, He dwelt here hard by, at a handsome— Lea. Farme sir, You say most true. Lop. Alonzo Tiveria; Lord, Lord, that time should play the treacherous knave thus? Why, he was the onely friend, I had in Spaine (sir) I knew your Mother too, a handsome Gentlewoman, She was married very young: I married 'em: I doe remember now the Maskes and Sports then, The Fire-workes, and the fine delights; good faith, sir. Now I looke in your face, whose eies are those Diego? Nay, if he be not just Alonzo's picture— Lea. Lord how I blush for these two impudents? Di. Well Gentleman, I thinke your name's Leandro; Lea. It is indeed (sir) Gra'-mercy Letter, thou hadst never knowne els. Di. I have dandled ye, and kist ye, and plaid with ye A hundred, and a hundred times, and danc'd ye, And swong ye in my Bell-ropes, ye lov'd swinging. Lop. A sweet Boy. Lea. Sweet lying knaves. What would these doe for thousands? Lop. A wondrous sweet Boy then it was, see now Time that consumes us, shoots him up, still sweeter. How do's the noble Gentleman? how fares he? When shall we see him? when will he blesse his Country? Lea. O, very shortly, sir, till his returne, He has sent me over to your charge. Lop. And welcome, Nay, you shall know you are welcome to your friend, sir, Lea. And to my Study (sir) which must be the Law, To further which, he would entreat your care To plant me in the favour of some man That's expert in that knowledge: for his paines I have three hundred Duckets more: For my Diet, Enough (sir) to defray me: which I am charged To take still, as I use it, from your custodie, I have the money ready, and I am weary. Lop. Sit down, sit down, and once more ye are most welcome, The Law you have hit upon most happily, Here is a Master in that Art, Bartolus, A neighbour by, to him I will preferre ye, A learned man, and my most loving Neighbour, I'll doe ye faithfull service (sir.) Di. He's an Asse, And so wee'll use him; he shall be a Lawyer. Lo. But if ever he recover this mony again: before Diego. And get some pretty pittance: my Pupill's hungry. Lea. Pray ye Sir, unlade me. Lop. I'le refresh ye Sir; When ye want, you know your Exchequer. Lea. If all this get me but accesse, I am happy. Lop. Come, I am tender of ye, Lea. I'll goe with ye, To have this Fort betray'd, these fooles must fliece me. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Bartolus, and Amaranta. Bar. My Amaranta, a retir'd sweet life, Private and close, and still, and houswifely, Becomes a Wife, sets off the grace of woman At home to be beleev'd both young, and handsome, As Lillies that are casde in christall Glasses, Makes up the wonder: shew it abroad, 'tis stale, And still and the more eyes cheapen it, 'tis more slubberd, And what need windowes open to inviting? Or evening Tarrasses, to take opinions? When the most wholsome Ayre (my wife) blowes inward, When good thoughts are the noblest Companions, And old chast stories (wife) the best discourses; But why doe I talke thus, that know thy nature? Ama. You know your own disease: distrust, &amp; jealousies, And those two, give these Lessons, not good meaning, What triall is there of my honestie, When I am mew'd at home? to what end, Husband, Serves all the vertvous thoughts, and chast behaviours Without their uses? Then they are known most excellent When, by their contraries they are set off, and burnish'd, If ye both hold me faire, and chast, and vertuous, Let me goe fearelesse out, and win that greatnesse; These Seeds grow not in Shades, and conceal'd places Set 'em i'th' heat of all, then they rise glorious. Bar. Peace, ye are too loude. Ama. You are too covetous, If that be rank'd a vertue, you have a rich one, Set me (like other Lawyers wives) off handsomely, Attended as I ought, and as they have it, My Coach, my people, and my handsome women, My will, in honest things. Bar. Peace Amaranta: Ama. They have content, rich clothes, and that secures 'em, Bindes, to their carefull Husbands, their observance, They are merry, ride abroad, meet, laugh, Bar. Thou shalt too: Ama. And freely may converse with proper Gentlemen, Suffer temptations daily to their honour. Enter Woman-Moore. Bar. You are now too far again: thou shalt have any thing, Let me but lay up for a handsome Office, And then my Amaranta— Ama. Here's a thing now, Ye place as pleasure to me: all my retinue, My Chamber-maid, my Kitchin-maid, my friend, And what she failes in, I must doe my selfe. A foyle to set my Beauty off, I thanke ye, You will place the Devill next for a Companion, Bar. No more such words (good wife) What would you have (Maid?) Moor. Master Curate, and the Sexton, &amp; a stranger (sir) Attend to speake with your worship. Bar. A stranger? Ama. You had best to be jealous of the man you know not. Bar. 'Preethee no more of that. Ama. 'Pray ye goe out to 'em, That will be safest for ye, I am well here, I onely love your peace, and serve like a slave for it. Bar. No, no, thou shalt not; 'tis some honest Client, Rich, and litigious, the Curate has brought to me, Pre'thee goe in (my Duck) I'll but speake to 'em, And returne instantly. Ama. I am commanded, One day you will know my sufferance.— Exit. Bar. And reward it. So, so, fast bind, fast find; Come in my Neighbours, My loving Neighbours pray ye come in, ye are welcome, Enter Lopez Leandro, and Diego. Lop. Blesse your good reverence. Bar. Good-day, good Master Curate, And neighbour Diego, welcome: what's your businesse? And 'pray ye be short (good friends) the time is pretious, Welcome, good sir. Lop. To be short then with your Mastership, (For I know your severall houres, are full of businesse) We have brought ye this young-man, of honest parents, And of an honest face. Bar. It seemes so (Neighbours) But to what end? Lop. To be your Pupill (Sir) Your Servant, if you please. Lea. I have travell'd far, sir. To seeke a worthy man, Bar. Alas, good Gentleman, I am a poore man, and a private too, Unfit to keep a Servant of your Reckoning; My house a little Cottage, and scarce able To hold my selfe, and those poore few live under it; Besides, you must not blame me Gentleman, If I were able to receive a Servant. To be a little scrupulous of his dealing For in these times— Lop. 'Pray let me answer that (sir) Here is fiue hundred Duckets, to secure him, He cannot want (sir) to make good his credit, Good gold, and coyne. Bar. And thats an honest pledge; Yet sure, that needs not, for his face, and carriage, Seeme to declare an in-bred honesty, Lea. And for I have a ripe mind to the Law (sir) (In which I understand you live a Master) The least poore corner in your house, poore Bed (sir) (Let me not seeme intruding to your Worship) With some Books to instruct me, and your Counsell, Shall I rest most content with: other Acquaintance Then your grave presence, and the grounds of Law I dare not covet, nor I will not seeke (sir) For surely mine owne nature desires privacie. Next, for your monthly paines (to shew my thanks,) I doe proportion out some twenty Duckets; As I grow riper, more: three hundred now (sir) To shew my love to learning, and my Master, My diet, I'll defray too, without trouble. Lop. Note but his mind to learning. Bar. I do strangely, yes, and I like it too, thankes to his money. Di. Would he would live with me, and learn to dig too. Lop. A wondrous modest man (sir.) Bar. So it seemes, His deare love to his Studie must be nourish'd Neighbour, he's like to prove. Lop. With your good counsell, And with your diligence, as you will ply him; His Parents, when they know your care— Bar. Come hither; Die. An honester young man, your worship ne're kept, But he is so bashfull— Bar. O I like him better, Say I should undertake ee, which indeed (sir) Will be no little straightnesse to my living. Considering my Affaires, and my small house (sir) For I see some promises that pull me to ye; Could you content your selfe, at first thus meanly, To lye hard, in an out—part of my house (sir?) For I have not many Lodgings to allow ye; And studie should be still remote from company; A little fire sometimes too, to refresh ye; A Student must be frugall: sometimes Lights too, According to your labour. Lea. Any thing (sir) That's dry, and wholsome: I am no bred-wanton. Bar. Then I receive you: but I must desire ye To keep within your confines. Lea. Ever sir, There's the Gold, and ever be your servant, Take it and give me Bookes: may I but prove (sir) According to my wish, and these shall multiply. Lop. Do, study hard, pray ye take him in, and settle him, He's onely fit for you; Shew him his Cell (sir.) Di. Take a good heart; and when ye are a cunning Lawyer, I'le sell my Bells and you shall prove it lawfull, Ba. Come, sir, with me: neighbors I thank your diligence. Lop. I'll come sometimes, and crack a case with ye. Bar. Welcome— Exit. Lop. Here's mony got with ease: here, spend that jovially, And pray for the Foole, the Founder. Die. Many more Fooles I heartily pray may follow his example, Lawyers, or Lubbers, or of what condition, And many such sweet friends in Nova Hispania. Lop. It will do well; Let 'em but send their moneys, Come from what quarter of the world, I care not, I'll know 'em instantly; nay I'll be a kin to 'em; I cannot misse a man, that sends me money: Let him Law there, 'long as his Duckets last, Boy, I'll grace him, and prefer him. Die. Ill turn Trade (Master) and now live by the living Let the dead stinke, 'tis a poore stinking Trade. Lop. If the young Foole now Should chance to chop, upon his faire Wife (Diego.) Die. And handle her Case (Master) that's a law point, A point would make him start, and put on his Spectacles A hidden point, were worth the canvassing. Lop. Now surely, surely, I should love him (Diego) And love him heartily: nay, I should love my selfe, Or any thing that had but that good fortune, For to say truth the Lawyer is a dog-bolt, An arrant worme: and though I call him worshipfull, I wish him a canoniz'd Cuckold (Diego) Now, if my youth doe dub him— Di. He is too demure (sir.) Lop. If he do sting her home. Die. There's no such matter, The woman was not borne to so much blessednesse, He has no heate: study consumes his oyle (Master,) Lop. Let's leave it to the will of Fate, and presently Over a cup of lustie Sack, let's prophecie. I am like a man that dreampt he was an Emperour. Come Diego, hope, &amp; whilst he lasts, we'll lay it on. Exit. Scæna Tertia. Enter Jamy Millanes, Arsenio. Jam. Angelo, Millanes, did you see this wonder? Mil. Yes, yes. Jam. And you Arsenio? Ar. Yes he's gon (Sir) Strangely disguis'd, he's set upon his voyage. Love guide his thoughts: he's a brave honest fellow, Sit close Don Lawyer, ô that arrant knave now, How he will stinke, will smoake againe, will burst: He's the most arrant Beast. Mil. He may be more beast. Ja. Let him beare six, and six, that all may blaze him, The villany he has sowed into my Brother, And from his State the Revenue he has reach'd at: Pay him, my good Leandro, take my praiers. Ar. And all our wishes plough with his fine white heifer. Ja. Marke him (my deare Friend) for a famous Cuckold, Let it out-live his Bookes, his paines, and heare me, The more he seeks to smother it with Justice, Enter a Servant. Let it blaze out the more: what news Andrea? Andr. Newes I am loth to tell ye: but I am charg'd (Sir) Your Brother layes a strict command upon ye, No more to know his house, upon your danger, I am sorry (Sir.) Jam. 'Faith never be: I am glad on't, He keepes the house of pride, and foolery: I meane to shun it: so returne my Answer, 'Twill shortly spew him out; Come, let's be merry, And lay our heads together, carefully How we may helpe our friend; and let's lodge neare him, Be still at hand: I would not for my patrimony, But he should crown his Lawyer, a learned Monster, Come, let's away I am stark mad till I see him. Exeunt. Scæna Quarta. Enter Bartolus, and Amaranta. Amar. Why, will ye bring men in, and yet be jealous? Why will ye lodge a young man, a man able, And yet repine? Bar. He shall not trouble thee (Sweet) A modest poore slight thing, did I not tell thee He was onely given to the Booke, and for that How royally he paies? finds his owne meat too. Am. I will not have him here: I know your courses, And what fits you will fall into of madnesse. Bar. Y'faith, I will not Wife, Am. I will not try ye, Bar. He comes not neare thee: shall not dare to tread Within thy Lodgings, in an old out-Roome Where Logs, and Coles were layd. Am. Now ye lay fire; Fire to consume your quiet. Bar. Didst thou know him, Thou wouldst thinke as I doe: he disquiet thee? Thou mayst weare him next thy heart, &amp; yet not warme him, His mind (poore man) 's o'th' Law, how to live after, And not on lewdnesse: on my conscience He knowes not how to looke upon a woman More then by reading what Sex she is. Am. I doe not like it (Sir.) Bar. Do'st thou not see (Foole) What presents he sends hourely in his gratefulnesse? What delicate meates? Am. You had best trust him at your Table, Doe and repent it doe. Bar. If thou be'st willing, By my troth, I thinke he might come, he's so modest, He never speakes: there's part of that he gave me, He'll eat but halfe a dozen bits, and rise immediatly, Even as he eats, he studies: he'll not disquiet thee, Doe as thou pleasest (Wife.) Am. What means this Wood-cocke? Knock within. Bar. Retire (Sweet) there's one knocks: come in, your businesse. Enter Servant. Ser. My Lord, Don Henrique, would entreat ye, Sir, To come immediatly, and speake with him, He has businesse of some moment. Bar. I'll attend him, I must be gon: I pre'thee thinke the best (wife) At my returne, I'll tell thee more, good morrow; Sir, keep ye close, and study hard: an houre hence I'll read a new Case to ye:— Exit. Leandro within. Lean. I'll be ready. Enter Amaranta. Amar. So many hundred Duckets, to ly scurvily? And learne the pelting law? this sounds but slenderly, But very poorely: I would see this fellow Very faine see him, how he lookes: I will find To what end, and what study: there's the place: I'll goe o'th' other side, and take my Fortune; I think there is a window. Exit. Enter Leandro. Lean. He's gone out Now, if I could but see her: she is not this way: How nastily he keepes his house? my Chamber, If I continue long, will choak me up, It is so damp: I shall be mortifide For any woman, if I stay a moneth here: I'll in, and strike my Lute, that sound may call her. Exit. Enter Amaranta. Lute and Song. Ama. He keeps very close: Lord, how I long to see him: A Lute strooke handsomely, a voice too; I'll heare that: These Verses are no Law, they sound too sweetly. Now I am more desirous. (Leandro peeping.) Lea. 'Tis she certain. Am. What's that that peeps? Lea. O, admirable face! Am. Sure 'tis the man. Lea. I will goe out a little. Am. Hee lookes not like a foole, his face is noble: How still he stands? Lea. I am strucken dumb, with wonder, Sure, all the Excellence of Earth dwells here. Am. How pale he looks? yet how his eies like torches, Fling their beames round: how manly his face shewes? He comes on: surely he will speak: he is made most handsomly: This is no Clerk behaviour; Now I have seen ye, I'l take my time: husb?d, ye have brought home tinder. Ex Lea. Sure she has transform'd me, I had forgot my tongue cleane, I never saw a face yet, but this rare one, But I was able boldly to encounter it, And speak my mind, my lips were lock upon me, This is divine, and onely serv'd with reverence; O most faire cover, of a hand far fairer, Thou blessed Innocence, that gaurds that whiteness, Live next my heart. I am glad I have got a relick, A noise within. A relick when I pray to it, may work wonders. Harke, there's some noyse: I must retire againe. This blessed Apparition, makes me happy; I'll suffer, and I'll sacrifice my substance, But I'll enjoy: now softly to my Kennell. Exit.</field>

Table-booke, 2 chairs, &amp; paper standish set out. Ja. It is my wonder, Oct. But not our fear, (Iacintha) wealthy men That have Estates to loose, whose conscious thoughts Are full of inward guilt, may shake with horrour, To have their Actions sifted, or appeare Before the Judge. But we that know our selves As innocent, as poore, that have no Fleece On which the Talons of the griping Law Can take sure hold, may smile with scorne on all That can be urg'd against us. Ia. I am confident There is no man so covetous, that desires To ravish our wants from us, and lesse hope There can be so much Justice left on earth, (Though sude and call'd upon) to ease us of The burthen of our wrongs. Oct. What thinkes Ascanio? Should we be call'd in question or accus'd Unjustly, what would you doe to redeeme us, From tirannous oppression? Asc. I could pray To him that ever has an open eare To heare the innocent, and right their wrongs: Nay, by my troth, I thinke I could out plead An Advocate, and sweat as much as he Do's for a double Fee, ere you should suffer In an honest cause. Enter Iamie and Bartolus. Oct. Happy simplicitie! Ia. My dearest, and my best one: Don Iamie, Oct. And the Advocate, that caus'd us to be summond. Asc. My Lord is mov'd, I see it in his lookes, And that man, in the Gowne, in my opinion Lookes like a proaguing knave. Iac. Peace, give them leave. Iam. Serve me with Processe? Bar. My Lord, you are not lawlesse. Iam. Nor thou honest; One, that not long since was the buckram Scribe, That would run on mens errands for an Asper, And from such basenesse, having rais'd a Stock To bribe the covetous Judge, call'd to the Bar, So poore in practise too, that you would plead A needy Clyents Cause, for a starv'd hen, Or halfe a little loyn of Veale, though fly-blowne, And these, the greatest Fees you could arrive at For just proceedings; but since you turn'd Rascall— Bar. Goodwords, my Lord. Iam. And grew my Brothers Bawd In all his vitrous courses, soothing him In his dishonest practises, you are growne The rich, and eminent knave, in the divels name, What am I cited for? Bar. You shall know anon, And then too late repent this bitter language, Or I'll misse of my ends. Iam. Wer't not in Court, I would beat that fat of thine, rais'd by the food Snatch'd from poore Clyents mouthes, into a jelly: I would (my man of Law) but I am patient, And would obey the Judge. Bar. 'Tis your best course: Would every enemy I have would beat me, I would wish no better Action. Oct. 'Save your Lordship. Asc. My humble service. Iam. My good Boy, how dost thou?

Offi. Make way there for the Judge. Jam. How? my kind Brother? Nay then 'tis ranck: there is some villany towards. Assist. 'Tis Sessions purchas'd at your suit, Don Henrique, Hath brought us hither, to heare and determine Of what you can prefer. Henrique. I doe beseech The honourable Court, I may be heard In my Advocate. Assist. 'Tis granted. Bar. humh, humh. Jam. That preface If left out in a Lawyer, spoyles the Cause, Though ne're so good, and honest. Bar. If I stood here, To plead in the defence of an ill man, (Most equall Judge) or to accuse the innocent (To both which, I professe my selfe a stranger) It would be requisite I should deck my Language With Tropes and Figures, and all flourishes That grace a Rethorician, 'tis confess'd Adulterate Mettals, need the Gold-smiths Art, To set 'em off; what, in it selfe is perfect Contemnes a borrowed glosse: This Lord (my Client) Whose honest cause, when 'tis related truly, Will challenge Justice, finding in his conscience A tender scruple of a fault long since By him committed, thinkes it not sufficient To be absolv'd of't, by his Confessor, If that in open Court, he publish not What was so long conceal'd. Iam. To what tends this? Bar. In his young yeares (it is no miracle That youth, and heat of Blood, should mix together.) He look'd upon this woman, on whose face The ruines yet remaine, of excellent forme, He look'd on her, and lov'd her. Iac: You good Angels, What an impudence is this? Bar. And us'd all meanes Of Service, Courtship, Presents, that might win her To be at his devotion: but in vaine Her maiden Fort, impregnable held out Untill he promis'd Marriage; and before These Witnesses a solemne Contract pass'd To take her as his wife. Assist. Give them their oath. Iam. They are incompetent Witnesses, his own Creatures, And will sweare any thing for halfe a royall. Off. Silence. Assist. Proceed. Bar. Upon this strong assurance He did enjoy his wishes to the full, Which satisfied and then with eyes of Judgement (Had winck'd with lust before) considering duly The inequality of the Match, he being Nobly descended, and allyed, but she Without a name, or Family, secretly He purchas'd a Divorce, to disanull His former Contract, marrying openly The Lady Violante. Iac. As you sit here The Deputy of the great King, who is The Substitute of that impartiall Judge With whom, or Wealth, or titles prevaile nothing, Grant to a much wrong'd Widow, or a Wife Your patience, with liberty to speake In her owne Cause, and let me face to face To this bad man, deliver what he is: And if my wrongs, with his ingratitude ballanc'd, Move not compassion, let me die unpittied; His teares, his oathes, his perjuries, I passe o're To thinke of them, is a disease; but death Should I repeat them. I dare not deny, (For Innocence cannot justifie what's false) But all the Advocate hath alleadged concerning His falshood and my shame in my consent, To be most true: But now I turne to thee. To thee Don Henrique, and if impious Acts Have left thee blood enough to make a blush, I'll paint it on thy cheekes. Was not the wrong Sufficient to defeat me of mine honuor, To leave me full of sorrow, as of want, The witnesse of thy lust, left in my womb, To testifie thy falshood, and my shame? But now so many yeares I had conceal'd Thy most inhumane wickednesse, and won This Gentleman, to hide it from the world To Father what was thine (for yet by heaven, Though in the City, he pas'd for my husband, He never knew me as his wife) Assist. 'Tis strange: Give him an Oath. Oct. I gladly sweare, and truly. Iac. After all this (I say) when I had borne These wrongs, with Saint-like patience, saw another Freely enjoy, what was (in Justice) mine, Yet still so tender of thy rest, and quiet, I never would divulge it, to disturb Thy peace at home, yet thou most barbarous, To be so carelesse of me, and my Fame, (For all respect of thine in the first step To thy base lust, was lost) in open Court Chess-boord and men set ready. To publish my disgrace? and on record, To write me up an easie-yeilding wanton? I thinke can find no president: In my extreames, One comfort yet is left, that though the Law Divorce me from thy bed, and made free way To the unjust embraces of an other, It cannot yet deny that this thy Son (Looke up Ascanio since it is come out) Is thy legitimate heire. Iam. Confederacie: A trick (my Lord) to cheat me; e're you give Your Sentence grant me hearing. Assist. New Chymera's? Iam. I am (my Lord) since he is without Issue, Or hope of any his undoubted Heire, And this forg'd by the Advocate, to defeat me Of what the Lawes of Spaine, confer upon me, A meere Imposture, and conspiracie Against my future fortunes, Assist. You are too bold. Speak to the Cause Don Henrique. Hen. I confesse, (Though the acknowledgement must wound mine honour, That all the Court hath heard touching this Cause, Or with me, or against me) is most true: The later part my Brother urg'd, excepted: For what I now doe, is not out of Spleene (As he pretends) but from remorse of conscience) And to repaire the wrong that I have done To this poore woman: And I beseech your Lordship To thinke I have not so far lost my reason, To bring into my Familie, to succeed me, The stranger—Issue of anothers Bed, By proofe, this is my Son, I challenge him, Accept him, and acknowledge him, and desire By a definitive Sentence of the Court, He may be so recorded, and full powre To me, to take him home. Iac. A second rape To the poore remnant of Content, that's left me, If this be granted? and all my former wrongs Were but beginnings to my miseries, But this the height of all: rather then part With my Ascanio, I'll deny my oath, Professe my selfe a Strumpet, and endure What punishment soe're the Court decrees Against a wretch that hath forsworne her selfe, Or plai'd the impudent whore. Assist. This tastes of passion, And that must not divert the course of Justice; Don Henrique, take your Son, with this Condition You give him maintenance, as becomes his birth, And 'twill stand with your honour to doe something For this wronged woman: I will compell nothing, But leave it to your will. Break up the Court: It is in vaine to move me; my doom's pass'd, And cannot be revok'd.— Exit. Hen. There's your reward. Bar. More Causes: and such Fees. Now to my Wife. I have too long bin absent: Health to your Lordship, Asc. You all look strangely, and I feare beleeve This unexpected fortune makes me proud, Indeed it do's not: I shall ever pay you The duty of a son, and honour you Next to my Father: good my Lord, for yet I dare not call you, uncle, be not sad, I never shall forget those noble favours You did me being a stranger, and if ever I live to be the master of a fortune, You shall command it. Jam. Since it was determi'nd I should be cozen'd, I am, glad the profit Shall fall on thee, I am too tough to melt, But something I will do. Hen. 'Pray you take leaue Of your steward (gentle Brother) the good husband That takes up all for you. Jam. Very well, mock on, It is your turn: I may have mine— Exit. Oct. But do not Forget us deare Ascanio Asc. Do not feare it. I Every day will see you: every houre Remember you in my prayers. Jam. My grief's too great To be expressed in words— Exit. Hen. Take that and leave us, Leave us without reply, nay come back sirrah And study to forget such things as these As are not worth the knowledge. Asc. O good Sir. These are bad principles— Hen. Such as you must learn Now you are mine for wealth and poverty Can hold no friendship: and what is my will You must observe and do, though good or ill. Exeunt. Scena Quarta. Enter Bartolus. Bar.

With any seeming shape of borrowed truth? Extenuate this wofull wrong, not error. Hen. You gave consent that to defeat my brother I should take any course, Viol. But not to make The cure more loathsome then the fowle disease: Was't not enough you took me to your bed, Tir'd with loose dalliance, and with emptie veines, All those abilities spent before and wasted, That could conferre the name of mother on me? But that (to perfect my account of sorrow) For my long barrennesse you must highten it By shewing to my face, that you were fruitfull Hug'd in the base embraces of another? If Solitude that dwelt beneath my roofe, And want of children was a torment to me What end of my vexation to behold A bastard to upbraid me with my wants? And heare the name of father paid to ye Yet know my self no mother, What can I say? Hen. shall I confesse my fault and ask your pardon? Will that content ye? Viol. If it could make void, What is confirm'd in Court. No no, Don Henrique, You shall know that I find my self abus'd, And adde to that I have a womans anger, And while I look upon this Basilisk, Whose envious eyes hath blasted all my comforts Rest confident I'le study my dark ends, And not your pleasures, Asc. Noble Lady, heare me, Not as my Fathers son, but as your servant, Vouchsafe to heare me, for such in my duty, I ever will appeare: And far be it from My poore ambition, ever to looke on you, But with that reverence; which a slave stands bound To pay a worthy Mistris: I have heard That Dames of highest place, nay Queenes themselves, Disdaine not to be serv'd by such as are Of meanest Birth: and I shall be most happie, To be emploi'd when you please to command me Even in the coursest Office, as your Page, I can wayte on your trencher: fill your wine Carry your pontafles, and be sometimes bless'd In all humilitie to touch your feete Or if that you esteeme that too much grace I can run by your Coach: observe your lookes And hope to gaine a fortune by my service, With your good favour, which now, as a Son, I dare not challenge Viol. As a Son, Asc. Forgive me I will forget the name, let it be death For me to call you Mother. Viol. Still upbraided? Hen. No way left to appease you? Viol. None: now heare me, Heare what I vow before the face of heaven, And if I breake it all plagues in this life, And those that after death are fear'd, fall on me, While that this Bastard staies under my rooffe, Looke for no peace at home, for I renounce All Offices of a wife, Hen. What am I falne to? Viol. I will not eate, nor sleepe with you and those howres Which I should spend in prayers for your health Shall be emploi'd in Curses, Hen. Terrible. Viol. All the day long, i'le be as tedious to you As lingring fevers, and i'le watch the nights, To ring alou'd your shame and breake your sleepes Or if you doe but slumber, i'le appeare In the shape of all my wrongs, and like a fury Fright you to madnes, and if all this faile To worke out my revenge, I have friends and kinsmen, That will not sit downe tame with the disgrace That's offer'd to our noble familie In what I suffer. Hen. How am I devided Betweene the duties I owe as a Husband, And pietie of a Parent? Asc. I am taught Sir By the instinct of nature that obedience Which bids me to prefer your peace of mind, Before those pleasures that are dearest to me Be wholy hers (my Lord) I quit all parts, That I may challenge: may you grow old together And no distast e're find you and before The Characters of age are printed on you May you see many Images of your selves, Though I, like some false Glasse, that's never look'd in Am cast a side, and broken from this hower (Unles invited, which I dare not hope for) I never will set my forbidden feete, Over your threshold: onely give me leave Though cast off to the world, to mention you, In my devotions 'tis all I sue for And so I take my last leave Hen. Though I am Devoted to a wife nay allmost sol'd A slave to serve her pleasures, yet I cannot So part with all humanity, but I must Shew something of a Father: thou shalt not goe Unfurnish'd and unfriended too: take that To guard thee from necessities; may thy goodnes Meet many favours, and thine innocence Deserve to be the heire of greater fortunes, Then thou wer't borne to. Scorne me not Violante This banishment is a kind of civill death, And now, as it were at his Funerall To shed a teare or two, is not unmanly And so farewell for ever: one word more, Though I must never see thee (my Ascanio) When this is spent (for so the Judge decreed) Send to me for supply: are you pleas'd now? Viol. Yes: I have cause: to see you howle and blubber At the parting of my torment, &amp; your shame Bed ready, wine, table Standish &amp; Paper. 'Tis well: proceed: supply his wants: doe doe: Let the great dowre I brought serve to maintain Your Bastards riots: send my Clothes and Jewells, To your old acquaintance, your deare dame his Mother Now you begin to melt, I know 'twill follow, Hen. Is all I doe misconstrude? Viol. I will take A course to right my selfe a speeding one: By the bless'd Saints, I will; if I prove cruell The shame to see thy foolish pitty taught me To loose my naturall softnes, keepe off from me Thy flateries are infectious, and i'le fle thee As I would doe a Leaper. Hen. Let not fury Transport you so: you know I am your Creature, All love, but to your self, with him, hath left me I'le ioyne with you in any thing Viol. In vaine I'le take mine owne waies, and will have no partners, Hen. I will not crosse you, Viol. Doe not, they shall find That to a Woman of her hopes beguil'd A viper troad on, or an Aspick's, mild.

Even now, the Curat fetch'd him, About a serious businesse as it seem'd, For he snatch'd up his Cloak, and brush'd his hat strait, Set his Band handsomely, and out he gallop'd. Amar. 'Tis well, 'tis very well, he went out (Egla.) As luckily, as one would say, goe Husband, He was call'd by providence: fling this short paper Into Leandro's Cell, and waken him, He is monstrous vexed, and musty, at my Chesse-play; But this shall supple him, when he has read it: Take your owne recreation for two houres, And hinder nothing. Moore. If I doe, I'll hang for't. Exeunt. Scena quarta. Enter Octavio, Jacintha. Oct. If that you lov'd Ascanio for himselfe, And not your private ends, you rather should Blesse the faire opportunitie, that restores him To his Birth-right, and the Honours he was borne to, Then grieve at his good Fortune. Jac. Grieve Octavio? I would resigne my Essence, that he were As happy as my love could fashion him, Though every blessing that should fall on him, Might prove a curse to me, my sorrow springs Out of my feare, and doubt he is not safe. I am acquainted with Don Henrique's nature, And I have heard too much the fiery temper Of Madam Violante: can you thinke That she, that almost is at war with heaven For being barren, will with equall eyes Behold a Son of mine? Oct. His Fathers care, That for the want of Issue, tooke him home, (Though with the forfeiture of his owne fame) Will looke unto his safetie. Jac.

Jam. Though there were an Ambush Layd for my life, I'll on and sound this secret, Retire thee (my Ascanio) with thy Mother: But stir not forth, some great designe's on foot, Fall what can fall, if e're the Sun be set, I see you not, give me dead.

Milo by continuance Grew from a silly Calfe (with your worships reverence) To carry a Bull, from a penny, to a pound, Sir, And from a pound, to many: 'tis the progresse. Bar. Ye say true, but he lov'd to feed well also, And that me-thinks— Lop. From another mans Trencher, Sir, And there he found it season'd with small charge: There he would play the Tyrant, and would devoure ye More then the Graves he made, at home he liv'd Like a Camelion suckt th'Ayre of misery, Table out Standish paper, stools. And grew fat by th'Brewis of an Eg-shel, Would smell a Cooks shop, and goe home and surfeit, And be a moneth in fasting out that Fever. Bar. These are good Symptomes: do's he lye so sick say ye? Lop.

Now spur the Asse, and get our friend time. Die. First then, After I have given my Body to the wormes (For they must be serv'd first, they are seldome cozen'd) Lop. Remember your Parish, Neighbour. Di. You speake truly, I doe remember it, a lewd vile Parish, And pray it may be mended: To the Poore of it, (VVhich is to all the Parish) I give nothing, For nothing, unto nothing, is most naturall, Yet leave as much space, as will build an Hospitall, Their children may pray for me. Bar. What doe you give to it? Die. Set downe two thousand Duckets, Bar. 'Tis a good gift, And will be long remembred. Die. To your worship, (Because you must take paines to see all finish'd) I give two thousand more, it may be three, Sir, A poore gratuitie for your paines-taking. Bar. These are large summes; Lop.

Give me some more drink. Pray ye buy Books, buy Books, You have a learned head, stuffe it with Libraries, And understand 'em, when ye have done, 'tis Justice, Run not the Parish mad with Controversies, Nor preach not Abstinence to longing women, 'Twill budge the bottoms of their consciences: I would give the Church new Organs, but I prophecie The Church-wardens would quickly pipe 'em out o'th' Parish, Two hundred Duckets more to mend the chancel, And to paint true Orthographie, as many, They write Sunt with a C, which is abominable, 'Pray you set that downe, to poore Maidens marriages. Lo. I that's wel thought of, what's your wil in that point? A meritorious thing. Bar. No end of this will? Di. I give per annum two hundred ells of Lockram, That there be no strait dealings in their Linnens, But the Sayles cut according to their Burthens; To all Bell-Ringers, I bequeath new Ropes, And let them use 'em at their owne discretions. Ars. You may remember us. Di. I doe, good Gentlemen, And I bequeath ye both good carefull Surgeons A Legacy, you have need of, more then money, I know you want good Diets and good Lotions, And in your pleasures good take heed.

You have made me full Executor. Di. Full, full, and totall, would I had more to give ye But these may serve an honest mind. Bar. Ye say true, A very honest mind, and make it rich too; Rich, wondrous rich, but where shall I raise these monys, About your house? I see no such great promises; Where shall I find these summes? Die. Even where you please Sir, You are wise and provident and know businesse Ev'n raise 'em where you shal think good, I am reasonable Bar. Thinke good? will that raise thousands? What doe you make me? Di. You have sworn to see it done, that's all my comfort. Bar. Where I please? this is pack'd sure to disgrace me. Di. Ye are just, and honest, and I know you will doe it, Ev'n where you please, for you know where the wealth is. Bar. I am abused, betrayed, I am laugh'd at, scorn'd, Baffel'd, and boared, it seemes. Ars. No, no, ye are fooled. Lop. Most finely fooled, and handsomely, and neatly, Such cunning Masters must be fooled sometimes, Sir, And have their worships noses wiped, 'tis healthfull, We are but quit: you foole us of our moneys In every Cause, in every Quiddit wipe us. Di. Ha, ha, ha ha, some more drink, for my heart, Gentlemen, This merry Lawyer—ha, ha, ha, ha this Scholler— I thinke this fitt will cure me: this Executor— I shall laugh out my Lungs. Bar. This is derision above sufferance, villany Plotted, and set against me. Die. Faith 'tis knavery, In troth I must confesse, thou art fooled indeed, Lawyer. Mil. Did you thinke, had this man been rich— Bar. 'Tis well, Sir. Mil. He would have chosen such a Wolfe, a Cancker, A Maggot-pate, to be his whole Executor. Lop. A Lawyer, that entangles all mens honesties, And lives like a Spider in a Cobweb lurking, And catching at all Flies that passe his pitt-falls? Puts powder to all States, to make em caper? Would he trust you? Die. Doe you deserve? I find, Gentlemen, This Cataplasme of a well cozen'd Lawyer Laid to my stomach lenisies my Fever, Me-thinkes I could eat now and walke a little. Bar. I am asham'd to feele how flat I am cheated, How grossely, and malitiously made a May-game, A damned Trick; my wife, my wife, some Rascall: My credit, and my wife, some lustfull villaine, Some Bawd, some Rogue, Ars. Some craftie Foole has found ye: This 'tis Sir, to teach ye to be too busie, To covet all the gaines, and all the rumours To have a stirring oare, in all mens actions. Lop. We did this, but to vex your fine officiousnesse. Bar. Good yeild ye and go'd thank ye: I am fooled, gentlemen; The Lawyer is an Asse, I doe confesse it, A weak dull shallow Asse: good even to your worships: Vicar, remember Vicar, Rascall remember, Thou notable rich Rascall.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Scæna Prima. Enter Violante and Servant. Ser. Madam hees come. Chaire and stooles out. Viol. 'Tis well how did he looke, When he knew from whom you were sent? was he not startled? Or confident? or fearefull? Ser. As appear'd Like one that knew his fortune at the worst, And car'd not what could follow. Viol. 'Tis the better Reach me a Chaire: So bring him in, be carefull That none disturb us: I will try his temper, And if I find him apt for my employments, Enter Iamy, Servant. I'll worke him to my ends, if not I shall Find other Engines. Ser. Ther's my Ladie, Viol. Leave us Iam. You sent for me? Viol. I did, and do's the favour, Your present state considered, and my power, Deserve no greater Ceremonie? Iam. Ceremonie? I use to pay that, where I doe owe dutie, Not to my Brothers wife: I cannot fawne, If you expect it from me, you are cozen'd, And so farewell. Viol. He beares up still; I like it, Pray you a word Iam. Yes; I will give you hearing On equall termes, and sit by you as a friend But not stand as a Sutour: Now your pleasure? Viol. You are very bold. Iam. 'Tis fitt: since you are proud I was not made to feed that foolish humour, With flattery and observance Viol. Yet, with your favour, A little forme ioyn'd with respect to her, That can add to your wants, or free you from 'em (Nay raise you to a fate, beyond your hopes) A Table ready covered with Cloath Napkins Salt Trenchers and Bread. Might well become your wisedome, Iam. It would rather Write me a Foole, should I but onely think That any good to me, could flow from you, Whom for so many yeares: I have found and prov'd My greatest Enemy: I am still the same My wants have not transform'd me: I dare tell you, To your new cerviz'd face, what I have spoken Freely behind your back, what I thinke of you, You are the proudest thing, and have the least, Reason to be so, that I ever read of In stature you are a Giantesse: and your Tailour Takes measure of you, with a Iacobs staffe, Or he can never reach you, this by the way For your large size: Now, in a word, or two To treat of your Complexion were decorum: You are so far from faire, I doubt your Mother Was too familliar with the Moore, that serv'd her, Your Limbes and Features, I passe breifely over, As things not worth description; and come roundly To your soule, if you have any: for 'tis doubtfull Viol. I laugh at this, proceed Iam. This Soule, I speake of Or rather salt to keepe this heape of flesh, From being a walking stench, like a large Inne, Stands open for the entertainment of All impious practises: but ther's no Corner An honest thought can take up: and as it were not Sufficient in your self to comprehend All wicked plots, you have taught the Foole, my Brother By your contagion, almost to put off The nature of the man, and turn'd him Devill Because he should be like you, and I hope Will march to hell together: I have spoken, And if the limming you, in your true Colours Can make the Painter gracious, I stand readie For my reward, or if my words distaste you I weigh it not, for though your Groomes were ready To cut my throat for't, be assur'd I cannot Use other Language Viol. You thinke you have said now, Like a brave fellow: in this Womans War You ever have bin train'd: spoke big: but suffer'd Like a tame Asse; and when most spur'd and gall'd Were never Master of the Spleene or Spirit, That could raise up the anger of a man, And force it into action, Iam. Yes vile Creature Wer't thou a subject worthy of my Sword, Or that thy death, this moment, could call home, My banish'd hopes, thou now wer't dead: dead (woman) But being as thou art, it is sufficient I scorne thee, and contemne thee Viol. This shewes nobly: I must confesse it: I am taken with it For had you kneeld, and whind and shew'd a base And low deiected mind, I had despis'd you This Bravery (in your adverse fortune) conquers And do's command me, and upon the sudaine I feele a kind of pittie, growing in me, For your misfortunes, pittie some sayes the Parent, Of future love, and I repent my part, So far in what you have suffered, that I could, (But you are cold) doe something to repaire What your base Brother (such Iami I thinke him) Hath brought to ruine Iam. Ha? Viol. Be not amaz'd, Our injuries are equall in his Bastard You are familliar with what I grone for And though the name of Husband holds a tye Beyond a Brother, I, a poore weake Woman, Am sensible, and tender of a wrong, And to revenge it, would break through all letts, That durst oppose me. Iam. Is it possible? Viol. By this kisse: start not: thus much, as a stranger You may take from me; But, if you were pleas'd, I should select you, as a bosome Friend, I would print 'em, thus, and thus, Iam. Keepe off. Viol. Come neare, Neere into the Cabinet of my Counsailes: Simplicity and patience dwell with Fooles, And let them beare those burthens, which wise men Boldly shake off; Be mine and ioyne with me, And when that I have rais'd you to a fortune, (Doe not deny your selfe the happie meanes) You'l looke on me, with more iudicious eies And sweare I am most faire. Iam. What would this Woman? The purpose of these words? speake not in ridles And when I understand what you would counsell, My answer shall be suddaine, Viol. Thus then Iami, The objects of our fury, are the same, For young Ascanio, whom you snake like hug'd (Frozen with wants to death) in your warme bosome, Lives to supplant you, in your certaine hopes, And kills in me all comfort. Iam. Now 'tis plaine, I apprehend you: and were he remov'd— Viol. You, once againe, were the undoubted heire. Iam. 'Tis not to be denyed; I was ice before, But now ye have fir'd me,— Viol. I'l add fuell to it. And by a nearer cut, doe you but steere As I direct you bring our Bark into The Port of happines, Iam. How? Viol. By Henriques death: But you'l say hee's your Brother; in great fortunes (Which are epitomes of States &amp; Kingdomes) Dishes covered with papers in each ready. The politicke brooke no Rivalls. Iam. Excellent. For sure I thinke out of a scrupulous feare, To feed in expectation, when I may (Dispensing but a little with my conscience) Come into full possession, would not argue One that desir'd to thrive, Viol. Now you speake like A man that knowes the World. Jam. I needs must learne That have so good a Tutresse: And what thinke you, (Don Henrique and Ascanio cut off) That none may live, that shall desire to trace us In our black pathes, if that Octavio His foster Father and the sad Iacinta, (Faith pittie her, and free her from her Sorrowes) Should fall Companions with 'em? When we are red With murther, let us often bath in blood, The collour will be scarlet. Viol. And that's glorious, And will protect the fact Jam. Suppose this don: (If undiscovered) we may get for money, (As that you know buyes any thing in Rome) A dispensation Viol. And be married? Jam. True. Or if it be knowne, trusse up our Gold and Jewells, And fly to some free State, and there with scorne— Viol. Laugh at the lawes of Spaine. 'Twere admirable. Iam. We shall beget rare Children. I am rap'd with The meere imagination— Viol. Shall it be don? Iam. Shall? tis too tedious: furnish me with meanes To hire the instruments, and to your self, Say it is done already: I will shew you, 'Ere the Sun set, how much you have wrought upon me, Your province is onely to use some meanes, To send my Brother, to the Grove that's neighbour, To the west Port of th'Citie; leave the rest, To my owne practise; I have talk'd too long: But now will doe: this kisse, with my Confession, To worke a fell revenge: A mans a foole, If not instructed in a Womans Schoole. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Bartolus Algazeirs and a Paratour. The Table set out and stooles. Bar. You are well enough disguiz'd, furnish the Table, Make no shew, what ye are, till I discover Not a soule knowes ye here: be quick and dilligent, These youthes, I have invited to a Breakefast, But what the Sawce will be, I am of opinion I shall take off the edges of their Appetites, And greaze their gums, for eating hartily; This month or two they have plaid their prizes with me And with their severall flurts they have lighted dangerously But sure I shall be quit: I heare 'em comming Goe off, and wait the bringing in your service, And doe it handsomely: you know where to have it Enter Millanes, Arsenio, Lopez, Diego.

No, when I considered It was a jest, and carried off so quaintly It made me merry: very merry, Gentlemen, I doe confes I could not sleepe to thinke on't The mirth so tickled me, I could not slumber, Lop. Good mirth do's worke so: honest mirth, Now, should we have meant in earnest— Bar. You say true Neighbour, Lop. It might have bred such a distast and sowrenesse, Such fond imaginations in your Braines, Sir For things thrust home in earnest— Bar. Very certaine But I know ye all for merry waggs, and ere long You shall know me too, in another fashion Though y'are pamper'd ye shall beare part 'oth burthen. Enter Amaranta and Leandro.

But silence best becomes me: if he meane foule play Sure they are enough to right themselves and let 'em, I'll sit by, so they beat him not to powder, Bar. Bring in the meate there, ha? Sit downe deare Neighbour A little meate needs little Complement, Sit downe I say: Am. What doe you meane by this Sir? Bar. Convay away their weapons handsomely, Am.

Invited, doe not wrong me, Fall to, good Guests, you have dilligent men about ye, Ye shall want nothing, that may persecute ye These will not see ye start; Have I now found ye Have I requited ye? You foold the Lawyer, And thought it meritorious, to abuse him, A thick ram headed knave: you rid, you spurd him, And glorified your witts, the more ye wrongd him; Within this hower, ye shall have all your Creditours, A second dish of new debts, come upon ye. And new invitements to the whip (Don Diego) And Excommunications for the Learned Curat, A Masque of all your furies shall dance to ye, Ars. You dare not use us thus? Bar. You shall be bobd (Gentlemen) Stir, and as I have a life, ye goe to prison To prison, without pittie instantly Before ye speake another word to prison. I have a better Guard, without, that waytes; Doe you see this man, Don Curat? 'tis a Paratour That comes to tell ye a delightfull story. Of an old whore, ye have and then to teach ye What is the penaltie; Laugh at me now Sir, What Legacie would ye bequeath me now, (And pay it on the naile?) to fly my fury? Lop. O gentle Sir, Bar. Do'st thou hope I will be gentle, Thou foolish unconsiderate Curat? Lop. Let me goe Sir, Bar. I'll see thee hang first. Lop. And as I am a true Vicar, Hark in your eare, hark softly— Bar.

You lenten Chaps, you that lay sick, and mockt me, Mockt me, abhonimably; abused me lewdly I'll make thee sick at heart, before I leave thee, And groane, and dye indeed, and be worth nothing Not worth a blessing, nor a Bell to knell for thee, A sheete to cover thee, but that thou stealest, Stealest from the Merchant, and the Ring he was buried with Stealest from his Grave, doe you smell me now? Die. Have mercy on me! Bar. No Psalme of mercy shall hold me from hanging thee How do ye like your Breakfast?

Doe Sir, and spare not I have bin too good a wife, and too obedient, But since ye dare provoke me to be foolish— Lea. She has, yes, and too worthie of your usage, Before the world, I justifie her goodnes, And turne that man, that dares but taint her vertues, To my Swords point; that lying man, that base man, Turne him, but face to face, that I may know him Bar. What have I here? Lea. A Gentleman, a free man, One that made triall of this Ladies constancie, And found it strong as fate; Leave off your fooling. For if you follow this course, you will be Chronicled Enter Iamy and Assistant. For a devill, whilst a Saint she is mentioned, You know my name indeed; I am now no Lawyer. Some comfort now, I hope, or els would I wer hanged up Die. And yet the Judge, he makes me swet. Bar. What newes now? Iam.

Take us to mercy too, we beseech your honour, We shall be justified the way of all flesh els, Iam. No more talke, nor no more dissention Lawyer, I know your anger, 'tis a vaine and slight one, For if you doe; i'll lay your whole life open A life that all the world shall i'll bring witnes, And rip before a Judge the ulcerous villanies You know I know ye, and I can bring witnes. Bar. Nay good Sir, noble Sir. Iam.

Enter Octavio, Iacinta, Ascanio. Oct. This is the place, but why we are appointed By Don Iami to stay here, is a depth I cannot sound, Asc. Beleev't he is too noble, To purpose any thing but for our good Had I assurance of a thousand Lives, And with them perpetuitie of pleasure, And should loose all, if he prov'd only false, Yet I durst run the hazard, Iac. 'Tis our comfort, We cannot be more wretched then we are, And death concludes all misery, Oct. Undiscovered Enter Henrique, Iami. We must attend him Asc. Our stay is not long With him Don Henrique? Iac. Now I feare; Be silent. Hen. Why do'st thou follow me? Iam. To save your life, A plot is laid for't, all my wrongs forgot, I have a Brothers Love. Hen. But thy false self, I feare no enemy. Iam. You have no Friend, But what breathes in me: If you move a step Beyond this ground you tread on: you are lost. Hen. 'Tis by thy practise then: I am sent hither To meete her, that prefers my life, and safetie Before her owne. Iam. That you should be abus'd thus With weake credulitie: She for whose sake, You have forgot we had one noble Father, Or that one Mother bare us, for whose love, You breake a contract, to which heaven was witnes, To satisfie whose pride, and willfull humour, You have expos'd a sweet, and hopefull Son, To all the miseries, that want can bring him, And such a Son, though you are most obdurate, To give whom entertainement Savages Would quit their Caves themselves, to keepe him from Bleake cold, and hunger: This dissembling Woman, This Idoll, whom you worship: all your love And service trod under her feete, designes you To fill a grave, or dead, to lye a pray, For Wolues, and vultures. Hen. 'Tis false; I defie thee, And stand upon my Guard Enter Leandro Millanes, Arsenio, Bart. Lopez, Deigo, Octavio Iacinta Ascanio and Servants. Iam. Alas, 'tis weake: Come on, since you will teach me to be cruell, By having no faith, in me, take your fortune, Bring the rest forth, and bind them fast. Oct. My Lord. Asc. In what have we offended? Iam. I am deafe, And following my will, I doe not stand Accomptable to reason: See her Ring (The first pledge of your love, and service to her) Deliverd as a Warrant for your death: These Bags of gold you gave up to her trust, (The use of which, you did deny your selfe) Bestow'd on me, and with a prodigall hand, Whom she pick'd forth to be the Architect Of her most bloudy building; and to Fee These Instruments, to bring Materials To raise it up, she bad me spare no cost, And (as a surplusage) offer'd her selfe To be at my devotion. Henr. O accurss'd! Iam. But be incredulous still; think this my plot; Fashion excuses to your selfe, and sweare That she is innocent, that she doats on ye; Believe this, as a fearefull Dreame, and that You lie not at my mercy, which in this I will shew onely: She her selfe shall give The dreadfull Sentence, to remove all scruple Who 'tis that sends you to the other world. Enter Violante. Appeares my Violante? speake (my dearest) Do's not the object please you? Viol. More then if All Treasure that's above the earth, with that, That lyes conceal'd in both the Indian Mines, Were laid downe at my feet: O bold Iamy Thou onely canst deserve me. Iam. I am forward, And (as you easily may perceive,) I sleepe not On your commands. Enter Assistant and Officers. Viol. But yet they live: I look'd To find them dead. Iam. That was defer'd, that you Might triumph in their misery, and have the powre To say they are not, Viol. 'Twas well thought upon: This kisse, and all the pleasures of my Bed This night, shall thanke thee. Hen. Monster! Viol. You Sir, that Would have me mother Bastards, being unable To honour me with one Child of mine owne, That underneath my Roofe, kept your cast-Strumpet, And out of my Revenues, would maintaine Her riotous issue: Now you find what 'tis To tempt a woman: with as little feeling As I turne off a slave, that is unfit To doe me service; or a horse, or dog That have out-liv'd their use, I shake thee off, To make thy peace with heaven. Hen. I doe deserve this, And never truly felt before, what sorrow Attends on wilfull dotage. Viol. For you, Mistris, That had the pleasure of his youth before me, And triumph'd in the fruit, that you had by him. But that I thinke, to have the Bastard strangled Before thy face, and thou with speed to follow The way he leades thee, is sufficient torture, I would cut off thy nose, put out thine eyes, And set my foot on these bewitching lips, That had the start of mine: but as thou art, Goe to the grave unpittied. Assist. Who would beleeve Such rage could be in woman? Uiol. For this Fellow, He is not worth my knowledge. Iam. Let him live then, Since you esteeme him innocent. Viol. No, Iamy, He shall make up the messe: now strike together And let them fall so. Assist. Unheard of crueltie I can endure no longer: seize on her. Uiol. Am I betrai'd? Is this thy faith, Iamy? Iam. Could your desires Challenge performance of a deed so horrid? Or, though that you had sold your selfe to hell, I should make up the bargaine? Live (deare Brother) Live long and happy: I forgive you freely; To have done you this service, is to me A faire Inheritance: And how e're harsh language (Call'd on, by your rough usage) pass'd my lipps, In my heart, I ever lov'd you: All my labours Were but to shew, how much your love was cozen'd, When it beheld it selfe in this false Glasse, That did abuse you; and I am so far From envying young Ascanio his good fortune. That if your State were mine, I would adopt him. These are the Murtherers, my noble Friends, Which (to make triall of her bloudy purpose) I won, to come disguis'd thus. Hen. I am too full Of griefe, and shame to speake: but what I'le doe, Shall to the world proclaime my penitence; And howsoever I have liv'd, I'le die A much chang'd man. Iam. Were it but possible You could make satisfaction to this woman, Our joyes were perfect. Hen. That's my onely comfort, That it is in my power: I ne're was married To this bad woman, though I doted on her, But daily did deferre it, still expecting When griefe would kill Iacintha. Assist. All is come out, And finds a faire successe: take her Don Henrique, And once againe embrace your Son. Hen. Most gladly. Assist. Your Brother hath deserv'd well. Hen. And shall share The moitie of my State, Assist. I have heard, Advocate, What an ill Instrument you have bin to him, From this time strengthen him, with honest counsells, As you'le deserve my pardon. Bar. I'le change my Copy: But I am punish'd, for I feare I have had A smart blow, though unseene. Assist. Curat, and Sexton, I have heard of you too, let me heare no more, And what's past, is forgotten; For this woman, Though her intent were bloody, yet our Law Calls it not death: yet that her punishment May deter others from such bad attempts, The Dowry she brought with her, shall be emploi'd To build a Nunnery, where she shall spend The remnant of her life. Viol. Since I have miss'd my ends, I scorne what can fall on me. Assist. The strict discipline Of the Church, will teach you better thoughts. And Signiors, You that are Batchelours, if you ever marry, In Bartolus, you may behold the issue Of Covetousnesse, and Jealousie; And of dotage. And falshood in Don Henrique, keep a meane then; For be assur'd that weake man meers all ill, That gives himselfe up to a womans will. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. To tell ye (Gentlemen,) we have a Play, A new one too, and that 'tis launch'd to day, The Name ye know, that's nothing to my Story; To tell ye, 'tis familiar, void of Glory; Of State, of Bitternesse: of wit you'll say, For that is now held wit, that tends that way, Which we avoid: To tell ye to 'tis merry, And meant to make ye pleasant, and not weary: The Streame that guides ye, easie to attend: To tell ye that 'tis good, is to no end, If you believe not. Nay, to goe thus far, To sweare it, if you sweare against, is war To assure you any thing, unlesse you see, And so conceive, is vanity in me; Therefore I leave it to it selfe, and pray Like a good Barke, it may worke out to day, And stem all doubts; 'twas built for such a proofe, And we hope highly: if she lye aloofe For her owne vantage, to give wind at will, Why let her worke, onely be you but still, And sweet opinion'd, and we are bound to say, You are worthy Judges, and you crowne the Play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. The Play is done, yet our Suit never ends, Still when you part, you would stil part our friends, Our noblest friends; if ought have falne amis, O let it be sufficient, that it is, And you have pardon'd it. In Buildings great All the whole Body, cannot be so neat, But something may be mended; Those are faire, And worthy love, that may destroy, but spare. FINIS.</field>
