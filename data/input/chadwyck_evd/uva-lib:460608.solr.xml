      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âAn Apartment in a Palace at Rome, richly decorated. EVA AND FLORA. Flora. How often, gentlest cousin! hast thou said That thou wouldst trust the history of thy love,â Now crowned with happiness,âto my true ear! I pray thee to fulfil that promise now. Thou knowest apart from thee and thine I lived, 'Mid mine own native hills, in Scotland's clime; Till hearing of my wan and sickly state, Thou kindly didst invite me to this clime Of golden summer's breath, to come with thee.â Gladly accepted I thine offer; thus Following thy flowery fortunes!âand behold I drink in health and strength with every breeze, That whispers hope, and reassurance, here, Baffled consumption has ta'en wing and flown Back to her clouds and vapoursâandâI live! Eva. How much do I rejoice, mine own sweet friend, That thus it hath been mine to minister To thy recovery. When I look on thee I love my lord's bright Italy the more, That its sweet airs have medicined thee so well, And call'd back to thy cheek the banished rose. And wills't thou, that to thee I should unfold The story of my love, from its first birth Until it bloomed in blushing pride full blown? Thou'rt daring, dearest cousin! for, in sooth, Love joys to hang on its own history, And grows full garrulous whene'er it meets With fostering kind encouragement. Methinks 'Twere best proceed at once upon my tale. âOn mine own happy England's distant shores, Three years ago, my father's noble friend, Montgomery's Earl, entreated us to pass Some months at his most hospitable house. My father, who had scarcely left his home Since my lost mother's long-mourned deathâand since A crowd of dark misfortunes clouded o'er His life's horizonâgave at last consent. We went thereâand there met Montalba:âfirst, He loved meâI believedâand I loved him! Yet though his aspect and his actions showed Entire devotionâdeep attachment's truthâ No formal declaration made he then; Yet ever and anon, with troubled air, Breathed vows of everlasting faith and love.â But to be briefâwithout imparting aught That could elucidate his 'haviour strange To meâunhappiest!âhe departed thence, And sought his sunny Italy once more. Then passed a year interminably long, With six most miserable months:âthe while I writhed in all the torments of suspense Till mine habitual movement grew a startâ And mine habitual breathing seemed a sigh!â Suffice it, he returned.âStraight sought me, soon Demanded and received thine Eva's hand. Since thenâa year, how golden and how short! Flewâlightened by, with pleasures plumed and lovesâ And some few monthsâ Flora. What means that altered tone?â That hesitating accent faultering low?â Nay!âgive me all thy soul! I pray thee speak; Shut not thy lips upon thy half-told tale. Something unspoken weighs upon thy heartâ These last few months?âhave they less golden been,â Less brightâless happy?â Eva. Hush! too loud thou speak'st; But sinceâoh! Flora! art thou blind indeed? Hast not thyself remarked a heavy change In my beloved Montalba? Hast not seen How wild, at times, his manner and his speech, And always struggling as with some deep woe? Though I have seenâand seen with sharper pain, A riot of unnatural mirth break out, E'en on the sudden, from his sterner moodâ The flash of funeral torches o'er the gloom! Flora. I own I have observed his altered mien, And restlessness, and gloomier air of late; But thenâthou know'st I have not dwelt in Rome For long;âand when I first arrived he seemed Most variable and strange of moodâto me;â I knew not he had e'er been otherwise! Eva. Ah, yes!âbut day by day, I saddening mark The increase and the inroads of that restlessness! His noble brow is ploughed with deep'ning lines; His eye is wild and hollowâevermore His varying manner doth distract my soul: Perpetual alternationâhour by hourâ Perplexing inconsistencies appear To baffle and to mock my pondering thought. Flora. And hast thou not indeed the slightest clue To his disturbing conduct's ravelled maze? Can'st guess no cause? Eva (agitatedly.) Perchanceâyet hardlyâyesâ I have some faint suspicions of the source Whence rise his deep dejection and distress;â Or ere we met he had affianced been To a most lovely maid, of noblest birthâ In his own native Florence. It should seem That love for me, which overtook his soul With stealthy, soft encroachment, was to her The unworthiest treason of inconstancy.â Both being then in the opening bloom of youth, 'Twas deemed advisable the espousals should Be for brief while delayedâand 'twas arranged The count should travel in this interval. Thus did he visit various distant landsâ Then came to our sweet island, as I said, And there his heart, too, play'd the truant's part!â When he rejoined her, that first love return'd, And they were at the altar pledged to meet; When death, a ghastly rival, forced her hence, And spun the sackcloth of despair and fate From the torn tissue of the marriage robes.â He mourned her heavilyâin lonely gloom, In solitude unbrokenâtill his health Slow breaking seemed beneath that sorrow's weightâ Then strenuously advised was change of scene, Of clime, and air, to soothe him back to life. He came once more to Englandâand we met, As I have told thee, yet once more!âand soâ We parted not again!â Flora. But yetâ'tis strange. Why should his grief return upon him thus, Once calmed and comforted, and won to peace; Nay moreâto happiness? Say what can mean This flow and overflow of bitterness, After the apparent ebbâfor evermore? This second harvest of the tares of tears, And weeds of heaviest, worstâheart-widowhood? Eva. Alack! I know notâshall I whisper thee? 'Tis a most fearful surmise! black as fate! And my soul rose within me when 'twas breathed, To shake it off as some envenomed snake;â That thought lies fathomlessly deep in tears!â The worst, the unshed ones!âfor I dare not weep;â I must not give it way, like grief indulged!â Flo. Speak on! What mean'st thou?âSay! what canst thou mean? Eva. It hath been whispered in my shrinking earâ That whisper, like the Archangel's trump, appear'd To shake this solid steadfast globe for me:â That that most dreadful curse which can crush down Immortal man to the worm's level, e'en Insanityâis in Montalba's blood! Flo. Horror of horrors!âstill not rashly judge. Who did suggest to thee this hideous clue? Eva. That fair Venetian countess whom thou know'stâ Giacintaâlong my husband's trusted friend. Flo. Giacinta!âWas she long thy husband's friend? It may appear unjustâungenerous, butâ I do mislike her strangely!âthere is that In the fierce flash of her resplendent eye, Which doth betokenâwhat, I know not well; But something that seems cloaked in careful wiles, And specious studied cunning.â Eva. Oh! not so; Thou art indeed unjust, ungenerous nowâ Accuse her of aught else! I well believe That lies not in her power; whate'er her willâ She could not e'en deceive us if she would, Her brow is such an index to her soul! Ofttimes I think I see and know her thoughts Ere she herself may know them; they do rush In such deep crimsoning currents, full and free, O'er her clear aspect, that concealment seems Of all things most impossible for her! So swiftly, too, the emotions come and go, She scarce hath time to cool themâor to school. Flo. It may be soâbut howsoe'er it be, Let not a loose conjecture warp thy mind, Or influence thy judgment. Eva. Oh, no! no!â Think'st thou I could believe this and yet breathe! Think'st thou I could support this thought and smile!â I do not give it credence! Flo. Have a careâ Methought but now I heard Montalba's voice; And, lo!âhis step:â'twere best I left thee now. Seek him, and probe his hidden wound of woe.â Eva. If I could gain but courage so to do! [Exeunt different ways. Scene II. âA Gallery with Verandah and Statues. MONTALBA AND EVA. Eva. My most dear lord, hast given thy steed the rein, In gallant galloping o'er the old Campagna? The flush of exercise is on thy browâ Seems in thy limbs its elasticity. Hast thou been wildly racing at thy wont? Mont. Yes! I have galloped, galloped o'er the plain! Would I could ride for ever on and on; Ride as the storm rides in its restlessness, Still forwardâforward! Wherefore must we pause, And put dull check on our delirious speed? Eva. Nayâmy Enrico; were thy courser asked, Soon would he snort his answer's argument. Mont. Oh! with the speed of winds, the haste of thought, To move for everâwho loves sunny skies? Give me the clouds in their impetuous chase! They shot above my head, erewhile, with speed That made my racing little rapid seem! How panted I to be among them then! My tempest-thoughtsâa whirlwind of swift wings,â Upbear my soulâyet not my self, on high;â Nay, nor my soul!âsave only where the rack Drives o'er the scowling skies with flying scorn, And shuts out all the sun! Would all things were On-driven with such mad swiftnessâthat were joy! Would, would our lives were on one lightning launched, That ere the eye's undazzled, should be done! Would that one hurrying hurricane could be All that we know of fate! Eva. Bethink thee yet: Wouldst have my love a lightning seen and lost? Our happiness such hurricane of haste? Wer't not a fatal fleetness, my beloved? Mont. Thy love, my matchless Eva! Never let A thought of change, or check, e'er dare to light Upon that sunniest summit of all truth! For happinessâno hurricane perchance More like to snow, that when it melts, i' the heart Is gone. A truce to such fantastic talk. Hast seen Giacintaâmy sweet wife! of late? Eva. Methinks not lately.âYes! we met yestere'en, But for one instantâshe had little time; Some Festa's preparations much engaged (If I remember rightly her excuse) Her thoughts and momentsâto thy taste avowed, Love mine! her visit thus had surely been;â 'Twas but a lightning-glanceâand she was gone! Mont. Why, Eva! thou art merry as the May! And so thou shouldst be, with her best of bloom On thine envermeiled check of loveliness! Whose flowery hues that sunrise hair doth tintâ With added brightness still!âsmile on!âsmile on! Eva. And so I will, if smilingly thou'lt give Thy joyous counselâbut the words thou say'st Are much belied by thine o'erclouded brow!â My smiles are stars, and shine from thineâtheir sunâ Be happy, thouâand all my life's one smile! Mont. Oh! no! my face is rather likened to The dial of a Sun of Beautyâthine! Whose changes make it shift its shadows still, Though never may it wholly shake them off!â Eva. Never say thou so sad a word again!â Oh! never say it with thine Eva near, Beloved Montalba, in thy sunny youth, While fortune rains o'er thee her best of wealth, When all should sparkle round thee with the dews Of Hope's glad morningâlove's Aurora tooâ And the fair dawn of thy high station's pride!â What shouldâwhat can afflict thee?â'twere most strange: On thy clear future not a shadow rests, No thought of self-reproach can dim thy past.â Mont. This is a tedious themeâand were well changed. Eva. To change it then.âHast thou not promised oft To bear me to thy favourite, flowery Florenceâ Lady of the Appenines and the Arno stream, The enchantressâmurmuring with her Tuscan tongue Such spells of sweetness that her guests are made For evermore her lovers and her slaves?â Take me to Florenceâto thy native place, Therefore the loveliest spot on earth for me, Even though 'twere disenchanted of all else That gives it beauty!âTake me to thy home, To thine aged father's presenceânor again With vain and vague excuses cheat my hope. Mont. Yes, thou hast changed the theme indeedâfull well: 'Tis from the ripple to the roar of stormsâ From the faint mist to midnight's gulphs of gloom. Eva. I cannot understand thy darkling speech. Mont. I pray thee pardon me:âmy speech is wild; But a dear friend hath told me heavy tales Of his deep sorrows. Eva. What dear friend, my lord? 'Tis surely one I knowâfor hast thou one Thou wouldst allow a stranger to remain To thine own little Eva?âAh! I guess 'Tis the young Guido who hath lately comeâ Mont. Guido? how say'st thouâwho? Eva. Hast thou not heard? The young Prince Guido Bellafioreâhe (hesitatingly)Whom thou didst know at Florence. Mont. (sharply.) What of him? Eva. I said he had arrived at Romeâand came Two hours ago to see thee:âthou wert far, Racing it o'er the wild Campagna's plains! Tell meâI knew it not beforeâis he A cousin of Giacinta's?â Mont. Oh! you know, You know he is her brother!âhush! no more. Eva. Nay, my EnricoâI beseech your pardon: I asked is he Giacinta's cousin. Mont. (abruptly.) Aye!â Eva. He seems a noble youth, of princeliest port, And gallant bearingâfrank and cordialâ Mont. Ayeâ Eva. What means this iteration, with a tone So sharp and sudden and so hollow-sounding? My husbandâthou art awearyâseek repose. The noon is sultryâthou must take, indeed, A short siesta to recruit thy strength. Mont. I will do soâand after this, wilt thou Touch thy dear harp and sing to soothe me, say?â Eva. Allâany thingâthat thou canst wish or ask! [Exeunt. Scene III. âA Hall in the Palazzo Ceria, belonging to Count Montalba. Anthony (behind the Scenes.) I told you now it was not me she called!â Enter Anthony and Antonio. Anto. 'Tis pity that our names are so alikeâ 'Tis too perplexing. Antho. Whew!âalikeâwhyâyesâ Except that you've so Frenchified your own You scarcely know itâwhich I'm not surprised at. Why can't you leave good English names aloneâ Without your onios and your aliases? I would forgive your heresies and plots, Your poisonings, robbings, stabbings allâbut not Your murdering thus the queen's sweet English; no! Anto. Murdering!âNay, come, good Anthonyâconfess. Antho. Not Iâ'tis barefaced, bloody murderâ'tis;â I wish ye all well hang'd for't!âso! be coolâ Now don't stealetto me,âfor I won't bear it! I ne'er took up the trade o'knife-swallower yet!â Anto. (Aside) More like a knife-grinder, with your harsh English. Anth. Well! hark ye, here, good Tony o! will you make A kind of compact-bargain with me now? Anto. First tell me clearly what the bargain isâ Antho. I warrant ye!âin English clear as crystalâ And no mistake:âthus thenâsuppose I now Teach thee this most delectable of tonguesâ White-satinâwax-work English!âfor thou know'st Thou dost pronounce it infamously ill; Nayâmost abominably. Thy return Shall be, to let meâin thy private earâ Abuse thy foreigneering country stillâ Thy language and thy climate. Anto. Wherefore so? Antho. Indeed I mustâI must some outlet find; I must abuse themâsoundly tooâor burst; I pray thee be my safety-valveâsay, done! Anto. (laughing.) Well!âdone!âa bargain; for to own the truth, Though sometimes you may try my patience hard, 'Tis most amusing your accounts to hear Of all you meet and see.âBut comeâbe justâ Own that the climate of the sweet, sweet southâ Antho. Is fit for salamanders more than Christians! Is it a bargain truly! Anto. Yesâagreedâ Antho. Well, then I breathe more freely! 'tis a weight Ta'en off my chestâbut where shall I begin? I'm sure I shall end never.â Anto. Nay! consent To give me first one lesson in your tongueâ Methinks I yet can prove the Italian sounds Are softerâpiercing to the very heart, With thrilling sweetness;âand for love, for loveâ No language like the Italian on the earthâ Caraâcarissimaâohâsilvery words! Antho. I differ from you there outrightâthat's all!â And think I can convince youâlist to me. When I was young, o'er head and ears in love, 'Twas thus I wooed my blooming angelâScroggins!â âGie us a good gripe at thy fist, my galâ Clap hands upon itâand go ask thy dad.â Let's have no blushing and no blubbering nonsense: Better for worseâwilt have me?ââNow, my friend, That's what I call a languageâmeaning there, And music too!âNo tweedle-dum and deeingâ But tuneable and tender melody; No drawling, dull caress-her-more'sâi' faith I think that scarce decorousâon my word:â My speech was modest, mild, and innocent,â Shortâshort and sweet,âaye, thrilling sweetness there, That pierces to the heart, I grant you. Anto. Yes! (aside)And pierces both the ears too, better far Than any jeweller!â(mine are smarting yet Inside and out from tympanum to tip, Breaks both the jaws besides this,âin the bargain!) Antho. I thought I should convince you; eh! thou own'st. Anto. (hastily) Oh, any thingâI pray you'd not repeat. Antho. And then the name! a fine high-sounding name, And very musical,âit rhymes so well;â I turned a bit of verse off on the occasion. Ahem!âahem!âAttend to these soft lines:â (Turning up his eyes)Whoop! I'd bear many floggings For black Sukey Scroggings. Anto. Black!âWas the lady one of colour, then? Antho. No! blockhead!âwould you put black-ey'd at length, And spoil the lovely, tender harmony? But you Italians have no sentiment, Nor flights of fancy and imagination. Faugh! I'm quite sick at such gross want of taste! Anto. The maiden with the charming, lovely name, (Which I would speak not for a Seignory!) Sayâwas she won by thy seductive suit And winning wiles of silvery poesy? Antho. Ayeâwas she!âWe kept company four years, And then (coughs) ugh, ughâahem!âWhy, then it chancedâ First she was carried off clandestinely By a hard-trotting blade i' the horse-dragoons, Who happened to be quartered near at handâ Soon afterâby a galloping consumption! Anto. Thus was she lost for thee! twice over lostâ Alack the day!âa heavy trial, sure! Antho. And between you and me, I do not doubt She pined herself to death for love of me, Sweet daffydowndilly of my dreams and hopes!â Who have we here?âOh! 'tis that skip-Jack page, Who tries for ever to make game of me! Enter Giachimo, with flowers, who goes to a small table in a corner and begins eating maccaroni. Giach. Good Signor Anthonyâpermit me thusâ Antho. Once more I tell theeânever Signor me; Nor Mounseer eitherâI'll not be insulted, You maccaroni-masticating monkeyâ Want you your jacket dusted, laced, and turned? Giach. Delicious maccaroni!âwould you taste Some of these stringsâ(to put you in good humour?â Antho. I'd sooner eat your livery shoulder-tags! Strings, quothaâumph! strings cut from that good cord That yet is destined to adorn thy neck, Were quite as nourishing and better savoured. Giach. Well! you refuse my bounteous offer now, Perchance you'll share that with me. Antho. How now, ape? I'll write my answer on thy back, ere long, In characters of good round cudgellingâ Where came those flowers you're grasping, spindle-shanks? Giach. From the Contessa di Castellenaria. Antho. Humph! Then I guess that thorns and snakes are 'midst them. Giach. Why so?âthe Countess is a noble lady, Indeed most excellent. Antho. Canst prove it, boy? Giach. Clearly! the proofs are in my pocketâthere, (shows money) Oh! a most generous ladyâthree times o'er. Look, I can prove it to ye!âoneâtwoâthreeâ(counts money.) Antho. What has she oiled thy palm forâmountebank? Mischief's abroadâand she makes thee her imp. What wants this Countess Castle-in-the-area, For ever coming here?âI wot no good. Why what art paid for, child?âdost know not, chit? Giach. Paid for!â'tis but the bounteous overflow Of the fair dame's munificenceâbut that!â Antho. The over-fiddlestickâI'll tell thee, then, If thou'rt so blank an ignoramus, know, Henceforth, thou'rt held the Lady Countess' spyâ Her eaves-dropperâreporterâmouth-pieceâmiscreantâ Thou must to crooked services be sworn!â Become one art, one lieâone eye, one ear. Giach. Nay, suffer me, at least, to keep in the ark Of my good person two of either kind! Antho. Thou meanest of the latter twainâ'tis true O'the former to thy precious making goes Multiplied millions,âwell! you understandâ You're sharp and shrewd enough, young infamy! You must become all eyesâall earsâa lynx To look, a hare to listen; add to these, A mute, save to thy mistress; or as she Should prompt thy whisperingsâhere and there, and hints Enough to sow dark discordsâwrongâmisleadâ Giach. Thou hast so well detailed in what consists The office that thou speak'st of, Anthony! 'Tis evident thou'st ofttimes filled the same With full and perfect credit to thyself, And satisfaction tooâto thy employers. Antho. Have at theeâbuzzardâout on thee, baboon!â Run for your life, young lily-liver, run; For sudden death is hanging by a thread O'er that most brainless skull.âBudge, budgeâbe off! Giach. Nay! Anthonyâa little fun, that's all. No harm meant.â Antho. Well! none done, thenâlet me see; Where was I?âoh! at discord. Giach. Yesâyou know You are in general. Antho. Thou must, like a crab, Walk sideling strangelyânoiseless as a cat!â Thou must be everywhere eternallyâ Burrowing in cornersâambushed under couchesâ Skulking in passagesâthrough chinks of planks Crannyingâmild foretaste of the pilloryâ And thrust up chimneysâsweet anticipation Of loftier rising stillâup the highest gibbet! Gich. Whyâwhat hath soured thy temper's sweetness so? 'Tis almost irritable, friend!âto-dayâ What makes thee hate the fair Venetian thus?â What leads thee to suspect her? Antho. To say truth, Nought but her looksâher mannersâand her voiceâ Addâher perpetual presence here unasked. Anto. How know'st thou that?âHer Excellency oft Hath welcomed her. Antho. His Excellency don't. Depend on it that he knows her wellâof old. For our sweet Countess, such a lambkin, sheâ She'd run into the wolf's mouthânor suspect. Anto. (aside.) The old man's senses want no sharpening, troth; They're groundâand good enoughâfor any game: I must not leave him so to think of her:â I fear for othersânot for her. (aloud)Fie! shame! How canst thou be so hard and so severe On an aimable lady? Antho. There!âyou, now!â How you unenglished that good word, you wretch! Say not aimableâit is a-mi-a-bul. Anto. A-mi-a-belâ Antho. Comeâbetterâbut not right. A-mi-a-bulâbulâbulâ Anto. Yes!âamiabul.â Antho. Right!âcapital.âNow all the rest o' the day I may console myself by launching forth 'Gainst your barbarious country. I am sure I gave you valuable hintsâindeed A lesson worth two guineas, if a groat. You know our bargain.âNo wry faces now. Stand to your coloursâscrew your courage up. Dare you not face my taunts?â Anto. In sooth I dare!â And parry themâor pay them back with usury. Giach. (starting.) Was't the clock struck? I've idled here an hourâ Alas! forgotten too the flowersâthey're spoilt! The gentle Countess will be sore displeasedâ Their beauty's fadedâthey are all but dead. Antho. So may the asps and adders be, I hope, Which they conceal. (to Giac.) So now up stairs, my gooseberry! [Exit Giac. Anto. (anxiously.) Art serious?âdost thou really think so?âsay? Be quick!â Antho. Think what!âthat you're a gooseberry too! Why reallyâ Anto. No! No! No! Antho. NayâNot so sure! Anto. Trash! think'st thou asps and adders are concealed? Antho. Go to, blunt-witted noodle;âno, not I; 'Twas but a tropeâa figureâa fantasticâ But I can ill explain itâsince that youâ You poor Italians, are so wantingâall Dull, dull as ditchwaterâand slow as snails Of comprehension.âYou have nothing light, Refined, or airy in your mould and make. Anto. Compared with yoursâyou floating featherâ Antho. Bed! I find out and forestall your meaning. When Will you do so for me? Enter Francesca hurriedly. Fran. Antonioâquick. His excellency calls youâhe seems chafed; He muttered wildlyâhoarse and angry.âRun! [Exit Antonio. And Anthonyâhow came it thou didst not Announce Prince Bellafiore? Antho. How do ye mean? Fran. He is aboveâten minutes hath been there, And the count met him unexpectedly Just nowâand seemed much vexedâand angered sore. Antho. Ho! then he got in at the garden side; A cool hand for a young beginnerâfaith!â Now, pretty Francy,âyou may take your oath There is a love-case in it!âLove ne'er deigns Come in at open doorsâif he can thrust Himself through half-closed windows. We shall have Our fair-haired Highland lassie soon, I guessâ Her highnessâPrincipessaâBell and Flowery, Fran. Ah! now I see it allâand they have met At many a festa lately, I have heard; At concerts too, and conversaziones. Antho. Done!âfor a thousand then!âI dare be sworn The settlements are making. Fran. 'Twere good luck!â Prince Guido seems a gallant cavalier, Handsome, and gay, and noble:âit would be A happy marriage!âAt the least 'tis sure He hath a very excellent moustache, A lofty-minded-looking cloak besidesâ And a most trust-worthy and priceless cane. Antho. Form these the whole sum of his worldly goods, And total of his virtuous qualities? Fran. Oh, no! a pair of snow-white gloves, gilt spurs, And ink-black love-locks, waving round his brow, And such surpassingly-proportioned boots!â Antho. Ha! ha! a precious catalogue indeed Of recommendatory charms and virtues;â Also, of rich possessions.âI should trust He hath more wealth than thou'st so aptly summed. Fran. Oh! these suffice for present purposes: And then a prince!âwhy, what can man want more? Antho. Say woman, and I do believe my lass!â Thou'rt about right!âSo little satisfies The sweet contented creatures! Fran. (seriously.) I must hence!â I am engaged in most important works,â One for the Scotch signora; 'tis, to place Around the corsage of her last new dress, âA lovely silk!ââ'tis shot and watered both. Antho. How! shoot and drown it too?âwhy! bless my heart! What barbarous deeds of haberdashery's harshness! What murder-mongering knaves must mercers be! Then, to crown allâyou doubtless cut it up! Fran. Assuredly!â'tis gored and slashed in style. Well, 'tis to place around the front of this (Be sure you keep the secret, Anthony; 'Tis to surprise them all with admiration.) Antho. (putting his finger to his nose,) Mum as the grave! Fran. A trimming finely wrought With lace and ribbons!âand the other is To decorate an apron for myself: The firstâI think you will agree with me, Is most momentous now!âHeavens! only think, Should some stray end of ribbonâstraggling, mar The symmetryâthe beauty of the whole, Or a wrong pucker in the lace appearâ Crumpling the prince's new-blown leaves of loveâ The bows and streamers, carelessly arranged, Might come untwined, and with them loosen all The golden ties of sympathy and soul! (Sighs)Theseâthese, are dread responsibilities! Antho. And what of th' apron, little sorceress?âheigh! Fran. The apron, oh! (coquettishly,) why, that may be perchance Of consequence as wellâbut I scarce knowâ However Paolo and RaphÃ¤el both, And ev'n the grave Guiseppe have remarked, That any one could see, from mine own dress, My studies were completed with success At Paris!âI must now devote myself To my most arduous undertakingâso Buon giorno!âAnthony! Anth. âBone jaw! no!â thereâ Why can't they say jaw-bone, like other Christians? Break jaw, I think it is: and pray what means she? Oh! no more jawing, doubtless, in plain English. Well! 'tis the ourang-outangerst language, quiteâ (Yawning,)Awâawâaw.âNow business, business, straight! I must Go hence and superintend the accounts at once! Ahem!âwith my interpreterâandâhemâ My private secretary, (that sounds well!) Without them I should cut a sorry figure, And my poor lord would pay a high one too! I like my titleâmajor duomo;âthough I never have discovered yet, nor heard Whether I hold that high and noble rank In the infantry or cavalry;â'tis strange! And I like not to ask, lest I should show My ignorance, and meet with mocking tauntsâ That gibing page would plague me for my pains! [Exit Anthony.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âThe Gardens of the Countess di Castellanaria's Palace. The Countess enters slowly and thoughtfully, with a letter. Giacinta. The hours hang heavy on my heart to-dayâ This loveâthis hateâthis hate and love divide, With terrible division, all my soul. Both, in the intenseness of their earnestness, Are as the awakening storms are to the sea, To my unquiet spirit:âit is lashed To agony by their conflicting powers! What deed is to be done?âfirst Vengeance!âCome, Fire all my thoughts;âarm all my energies! I do devote myself to thine and thee! When thou art compassed softer hopes may smile!â Let me not dwell on these, lest they should melt My soul with the Infinite of Tenderness! Come, Vengeance, come, and seize mine every thought, Mine every powerâfor I am pledged to thee! Through seas of sins would wade to call thee mine. Is't not most true, that when we first diverge Into the paths of Wrong and ways of Doom! We do unite ourselves with the unforgivenâ The fallen angelsâdread and rebel host!â And so re-kindling their extinguished Warâ And rallying round the banners of their strife, Marshalled in pomp of towering bravery, charge 'Gainst all the embattailed Hierarchies of Heaven!â Thus are we made the champions of the undoneâ The Imperial Chivalry of hell and death! A horrible and ghastly thought!âbut hence Ye vain reflections!âI will royally Do battle 'gainst the coward conscience now, And plunge into the abyss of threatening fate!â (After a pause.) How hath the insidious love swept o'er my soul, In sudden floods of feelingâas the deep!â Whelming too many formed and fixed intents, And laboured schemes:âI must with strenuous care Recall my aimsârepeat my efforts now. Soâthat last letter!âI did think I knew The superscription's charactersâbehold! Yes! 'tis from one who in our enterprise Hath set his heart and spirit!âA faint fear That something hath ill-chanced, doth make me still Delay thus the opening it. Pshaw!âfolly thisâ And childish superstition. (Reads) So! All's well! (Reads)âOne I can freely recommend to thee Most conscientiously. . . . A heart on fireâ For liberty and full equalityâ Distinguished in the late attempts!ââSoâso. âOf rankâand soâand so.âMisdoubt him notâ His name Alphonse De Tours.ââWellâall is well! (Puts up the letter.) Now do I marvel that my messenger Is not returnedâit is long past the hour! Could I see LudovicâI would straightway form My plansâfor present exigenciesâthen Send to invite de Tours, and sound himâha! My messenger! Enter Messenger. Mess. Your excellency gave Command to me to leave your good despatch Down by the old ruined shrine in the olive-wood, Beneath the height whereâ Gia. Hush!âmore chary be Of words, I charge ye, sirrah;âat the least Speak thou in voice less loud. Air's full of ears As heaven of eyes!â Mess. Your pardon, lady!âWhile I paused to lay the letter on the shrine, He cameâand straight perused it, and desired I would convey his brief replyâas thus,â He will attend your excellency here This even, after sundown. Gia. It is well. You may depart. Hereâmy good Raphael, stay; First bend your fingers o'er this trifling giftâ(gives money,) The acknowledgment of your shrewd services. Another time, though, race it with more speedâ You kept me waiting tediously. Mess. Indeedâ Most gracious madam!ârang my horse's heels A merry measure to the inspiring tune Of seven good leagues i' the hour:âi' faith I found Most excellent relays, and spared not speed. Gia. 'Tis good, you may retire, Sir. [Exit Messenger. 'Tis not good. It irks me he should come not till the even: Were my plans ripenedâall the parts preparedâ I mightâbut 'tis no matter;âthis delay May give me time more fully to mature And mouldâ Enter Servant. So please you, gracious countess, waits Prince Guido Bellafiore, with his friendâ The Count Monzano,âand requests to know If now your excellency's leisure would Permit their entrance? Gia. On the instant!âYes! [Exit Servant. My heart's tempestuous throbbings make me faint.â This is a strife where weakness doth too well, Antagonizing all the array of power, Conquer the loftiest in their mightiest mood! Enter Prince Guido and Count Giulio. Guido. Fair countessâmost beholden are we both To you for this permission to approach Your person at this rude and early hour.â We craved admittance at unwonted time, Since my friend Giulio hath some leagues to ride To meet his sisterâand must soon to horse:â Thus we entreat your pardon and your grace. Gia. Most welcome are you.âYou must pardon me For thus receiving both without dull forms, And tedious ceremonials, starched and stiff, Here in my gardens!â Giulio. 'Tis as it should be, A rose 'midst rosesâand a queen of flowers! I have received communications, late, From a tried friend of yours, which he requests I should impart to you.âAm I permitted? Gia. (coldly.) What are they, Sir? Giu. (piqued.) Urgent and secret both. Am I permitted? Gia. Nay, ask Guido's leave. Guido. Think not of me, I pray you. Giulio. 'Twill be brief. (They walk apart.) Guido. How beautiful!âhow gloriously the smile Breaks through the gloom that ofttimes seems to dwell On those fine features.âFlora's fairâmost fair:â Yet do I almost fear myself, and doubt My own high constancy, when all the spells Of this dark, burning beauty, and rare pride Of this consummate creature thrill my heart! What quenchless fires are in that haughty eye! What worlds of witchery melt around those lipsâ Her dark hair, like some glorious banner floats, Which 'twere a joy to follow to the death! Her steps are victories! and her smiles are queens! And all her looks are Empire!âAs she moves, So prodigal of loveliness she seems, That the air is set ablaze with her proud brightness, And all grows like her that surrounds her even! Till Beauty is the World methinks!âShe comes! The Countess and Count Giulio approach. Gia. Alas! Alas! Guido. (agitatedly.) I fear me thou hast heard Dark evil tidings that disturb thee thus;â Some sad mischanceful turn in thine affairs:â If so, I pray thee to command me. Sayâ Can I in any sort assistance lend? Thou know'st I'm honoured by relationship, And near relationship, with thee. Gia. Best thanks!â 'Tis nought mischanceful that concerns myself, No evil tidings of a private nature!â 'Tisânay, 'tis not! (Pausesâthen breaks forth abruptly and enthusiastically,) Oh! Heavens! it will have way. What can so pierce us to the heart of hearts, Rack us in every thought that we can shape; Crush us downâdown unto the dust of death, Multiply in us every faculty, All capabilities of sufferance even, Enlarge the field, the scope of life and fate, Till that embraceth thousand thousands! all Who ought to feel, though they may feel notâtoo, Measure for measure, as we feel and madden!â What can do thus but soul-deep sympathy In all our country's sufferings?âaye! but that! Till grows that royal sympathy sublimed Into a god-like courage and resolve, When once the fire of indignation bursts Within the awakened bosom, full and free, Like long pent-up volcanic flames let loose, Till then 'tis the Unapproachable Despair.â Say, that unanswered love may woundâwringâwaste!â Say, that cold disappointment of high hopes May blast, may blightâthat death of friends beloved May sickly o'er the very hues of lifeâ What is't to that immensity of anguish, Those immortalities of lengthening woe, Those uttermost supremacies of grief, Which seem to absorb our fates and feelings allâ All in our Country's! Then ten thousand times, And thrice ten thousand thousand o'er and o'er, We feelâa People's pangs become our own; Our cares are grown colossalâand our soul Breaks every bound, while presentâfutureâpastâ Are mergedâmake but one date in our wide doom, Our most gigantic destiny!âThe Past, With all the heroic blazonry of deedsâ By our forefathers compassed, lights our soul But with a desolate funereal glare, So blended with the Present's deathlike gloom; The Future too 'tis veiled with stern suspense, What though the etherial Hope may strive to gildâ 'Tis by our dark imaginings endued With semblance still of the actual; so we live, We feel and liveâand only live to feel, In our adored high father-land's deep fate, All ages forwardâand whole centuries back!â We feelâwe liveâand do o'erflow ourselves! Still with what strong concenteredâyet encirling Intenseness of existence in the Now! 'Tis they who love their country next to heavenâ 'Tis they who see their country wronged and wrackedâ 'Tis they who feel their country's fate their ownâ 'Tis they who wear their country at their heart, That would ten million times dare all earth's deaths To give her freedom!âthat one, only life, That know what feeling can be made in man! Aye! or in woman!âfor the love that forms Her being's whole makes her one melting heart, That bleedsâthat breaks in her wrong'd country's breast, Yet in that melting, like the Alps' snows dissolved, That bear all with themâthus 'twill fall to conquer! Guido. By heaven! she fires me till my soul's in flames! My heart with agonizing ardour bounds. Guilio, how stand'st thou, wrapt in dull repose! Heard'st thou the impassioned callâthe awakening cryâ The Heaven and Earth-electrifying tones? Saw'st thou the visionary sunburst-light, That made her eyes like fountains of starr'd fire? Mark'dst thou her movements, that did monarchize O'er all the soul, and swelled it mountains high, Seeking at least to keep in sight her own? The enthusiast passion, mounting more and more, Seizes on her's, and lifts it o'er the stars. Why! lady!âVictory couches at thy feet; Thy looks are armamentsâthy words are hosts! Thy thoughts are all a pomp of marshalled war! Thy will's a triumphâand thy wish a fate; Thy heart one world of fiery chivalry; Thy lowest whisper such a clarion's blast As shall rock nations yetâand empires change; And where thy shadow falls, may battle breathe, And shouting conquest tower in laurelled state. Lo! there was that in thy commanding tone That might have roused the almighty Rome from ruin, With all her conquerors to the rescue!âLo! There was a trumpet-tone of thrilling power, To thunderstrike the CÃ¦sars in their grave, And bind the imperial champions to thy causeâ Trebly imperial made through thy proud soul, That should inspire them with its own dread life. With the ecstacy of admiration stunned, Breathless with the all-o'erpow'ring torrent tide Of stormy joy and fiery zeal, I stand!â And pray thee further to unfold thy soul, Pre-eminently glorious as it is! Gia. Alas! the lightning, from the spirit launched, When clash its cloudsâtempestuously a-stirâ Shines but with momentary splendoursâfrown The glooms again, and shut those Storm-Suns out!â 'Tis not that hope is feebler, but that all The deep responsibilities entailed On those who would a work of such large Change, Merging ten thousand holiest interestsâspeed, Oppress, with soul-o'ershadowing thoughtfulness! Oh! Italy! Our Italy!âShalt thou Ere rear again thy queen-like brow on high!â Ah! not before thou hast endured worse woes,â The stage of slaughter made and scene of strife. But no! those noble woes may not be worse! War, war, may kill the bodies of the brave; But such a peace of slavery and oppression Kills the whole Country's Soul, and makes LifeâDeath! Mine own sweet Veniceâbe the first blow struck To hack those chains that do disgrace thee now, Launched like a royal argosy of price, A Warrior-bark of glory, yet once more, On the high billowing seas of liberty! For now thou'rt on thy stagnant waters chained, That thicken into slime about theeâthusâ Of all the bravery of their navies spoiled, Lit by no beacons, by no banners blazed!â Still on that solemn bed of waters laid, Thou'rt like some beautiful and mighty corse, Girt with old circumstance of stern decay, Touched with pale funeral beauty, sad and deep. Oh! but to send once more through those chilled veins The lightning play of freedom's pulses! then To bow to death unmurmuringly! nay, more, With such a rapture as life never knew!â Guido. The proud amazement seals my senses still! Where are we? Should not thousand thousand swords Leap from their scabbards when thou speak'st of war? Gia. They willâyet, yet they willâthe shuddering snows Shall loosened fall, from all the awakening hills. Aye! avalanche on avalanche shall roll, When peals the trumpet-summons to this war! Rollâroll, ensanguined and incarnadined, In the heart's blood of heroesâfounts of fire!â That soon shall melt them, till the immingling seaâ In coloured overflowâmake earth blood-red! But that shall yet subsideânor leave a stain, One blush of burning shame for all her wrongs! And ever after, the bright hues of peace, The whiteness of the unspotted liberty, And all the sunshine of man's happiness Shall bless her in the gazing eye of heaven! And wilt thou join us, prince and cousin? say! Guido. Lead on!âall lesser lights obey the sun;â The spirit stirs the frame e'en as it lists. Gia. I need not caution thee; no word, no breath! Guido. Lady! my voice is sheathed with my sheathed sword. Gia. Both shall be freed from their imprisonment; Meanwhile 'twere best with Count Monzano straight Thou shouldst confer.âSo he shall lay before thee The map of our designâand this proud web Unravel for thy scrutiny, that yet Shall toil the insulting tyranny, and tame!â Guido. Hath this been long designed? Gia. Not longâsome months.â Guido. I have myself full oft revolved such things. Who hath not, that hath soul and sense of feeling? But the laid Train of mine unbreathed-of Thought Paused for such spark as thy bright speech hath proved! 'Tis now one flameâand sways, and rocks, and gleams, And shoots with burning, spiry rings to heaven. Gia. No longer cousinâbe my brother now. Our souls are one. Guido. Thy brother!âhappiest he Who dwells the nearest to thy noble heart! Glorious enthusiast! thy soul dazzles mine! Enter Servant with a note. Servant. Countessâthe bearer will in brief return. Gia. 'Tis well: inform me when he waitsâretire!â (To Giulio.)'Tis from De Toursâand prays an interview! May he be all our hopes are taught to look for!â Guido. Adieu, Giacinta! We shall meet again, Ere long, againâand oftentimes, I trust. Gia. Aye! gallant Guido!âGiulio! yet a word. He in one instant's space shall follow thee. [Exit Guido. I pray theeâcaution him to lock his lips. So rashâso youngâI tremble! Every look Beams a resplendent and unshrouded truth!â Why, why so silent art thou, and so cold?â Giulio. Perchance thy heart can answer that for me. Gia. Nay!âjealous? didst thou swear not, o'er and oe'r, Never to nourish that poor passion's venom. Giulio. Giacinta! there are times when man's all man, That isâan abject wormâthat writhes and feels, Answering each torture with convulsive motion. Gia. Go to! thou'rt weak indeed! thou'lt rouse my scorn, If some light fancy draws me to this youth. I love thee not the less!âand so thou'rt sure That no inconstancy can quite divide us!â Giu. 'Tis most cold comfort!â Gia. (impatiently.) Follow him!âHe waits!â Giu. I go; and then proceed to meet my sister. Therefore, farewell, Giacinta, till the morning. [Exit Giulio. Gia. Up!âmine exultant rapture!âto the skies. Up!âup!âwith all thy joy! my life! and soul: He loves me:âyes! I know it!âfeel it!âhug The deep, thrice-costly knowledge to my soul; That kingly, kingliest knowledge! I am made All one bright beatific Feeling now!â My spirit burnsâone gush of torrent-gladnessâ A-blaze, with all the imperial consciousness!â And thron'd on that most conquering thought of thoughts.â He loves me!âHeaven and Earth! resound those words! Become one mighty echo of my heart!â My Guido! mine! oh! words too wild with bliss! He loves me! yes, those fervid, dark-blue eyes Proclaimed with every look the impassioned truth!â Yetâyet I see himâwith his death-black hair, Dashed backwards from his proud, monarchic brow!â Where sate enthroned the majesty of soul! How beautiful those features! Heavens! how perfect!â How sculpture-like in their transcendent grace! Paleâthe proud paleness of the enthusiast thought,â And passionâpassionâtoo, yet more profound! Pale as the heavenâwhen whitening with its stars, So is thy countenance with thoughts and dreams. Enter Servant. Servant. Madamâthe messenger your pleasure waits. Gia. Bid him assure his master, from myself, His speedy presence will be welcome here. [Exit Servant. Ere many minutes have elapsed, methinks, Will he arriveâthis gallant young De Tours. (looks at note.)Yes!âin the piazza, close at hand, he dwells, And will not tarry: when he leaves me, then Must I address myself to business straight; And after sundown comesâthe Brigand's Kingâ The staunch black Ludovic, our firmâally! That sound may jarâbut what are sounds but breath!â First shounld I send dispatches, far and wide, Reporting our proceedings and intents, Detailing all toâtheâconspirators!â That word doth grate me strangely!âchange it, thenâ As our success will doâif we succeed! Shame! shame! my heart, to nurse so poor a doubt. We shallâwe must succeed.âAll smiles around, But most th'indomitable heart within! Then 'twill be conquerors!âpatriots!âthe armed deliverersâ The avenging heroesâsaviours of their country; While charioted in warrior-state, we roll From triumph on to triumphâpower to powerâ Aye! sovereignty to sovereignty; for so Shall we then reign i'the people's love and faith, That jewelled tires of kings shall pave our paths! And those who fallâfor surely some must dieâ Shall fall with trophies for their monumentsâ No longer the conspiratorsâthe martyrs!â And those that live, and live to seize the prize, Shall walk enlaurelled through triumphal ways. No longer the conspiratorsâthe champions! For Circumstanceâand Accidentâand the Actual, With all the Enthroned Omnipotencies sway, That most command and most controul mankind!â And lord it o'er the immortal, boundless soul. Roll, roll, ye daysâroll, hurrying to that hour Which shall develope our august design!â Then step by step shall I on high ascend, Even to my wild ambition's cloud-capped peak; For I would reign o'er this most royal land, My then regenerate Italy!âAnd now With loftier zeal soars up my longing thoughtâ The crown that I would challenge worlds to gain, I covet most to lay atâGuido's feet! Now pours the deluge of delight once more, With such immeasureable o'erwhelming's power, I scarce can bear the suffocating sense Of mine unfathomable happiness! So!âstings one thought to qualify it yetâ One forkÃ©d fearâone jarring, jealous doubt. Doth not his heart still lean to Floraâstill Wear her detested image in its core? Nay! let me bind him so unto our causeâ So rouse his spiritâand so trance his soul, That thus that cause and I together may Depose each other feelingâhopeâand aimâ And fill up all the avenues of soul!â Let him be wedded unto both!âshall I That glorious rival with distrust regard? No!âbut there build assurance, fixed and firm, And found all confidence!âA footstepâha! Enter M. De Tours. De Tours. Lady! my homage and myself are laidâ Where worthier things are prostrateâat thy feet. Gia. With pleasure and with pride I welcome thee; I welcome thee to our eternal Rome, To the high court and congress of our cause! Enough!âfor hurryingly on the untripped heels Of our design now execution treads!â We must at once deep matters weigh, and probeâ And compliments, and ceremonials waive. De Tours. Right willinglyâthe papers I have brought, This evening to thy hand shall be conveyed; These will acquaint thee with the amount of aid Cooperationâcontributionsâall Thou mayst expect from certain quarters!âSo! This prospers!âLady, I rejoice in truth, And wish our bright auspicious day had dawned!â Gia. Ere long it willâto wrap all the earth in light. De Tours. I have borne part before in strifes like this, And, pardon me, I own was half aweariedâ But with fresh zest I enter on this cause: The stage is different, if the play's the same; And troth, it is a pleasant theatreâ This same bright, sunny Italy of yoursâ And 'tis a novelty, besides, for those, Who here are joined are young beginners all, Tyros and novices!â'Twill be amusement To watch their raw rehearsings;âas for usâ The twelve years' urchin's like a veteran now; Each Polythecnic pupil might confront The old Carthaginians' famed Tactician wellâ Check-mate bold Hannibalâmake CÃ¦sar's self Comeâseeâand slink back conqueredâto re-write His Commentariesâmade the pupil's pupil! There's nothing in our glorious France I swear, Newâstrangeâuntriedâor freshening to the soul, I' the way of plots, broils, outbreaks, civil wars, Rebellions,ârevolutions,âregicides,â Schisms,âseizures,âcondemnations,âexecutions,â Or private crime,âor public clamour left!â This makes our home seem strangely tiresomeâ (yawns)Exceeding dull and most monotonous; Our life's a very vegetation there! Since novelty's the salt and seasoning still Of every pleasant relaxation!âfaith!â That gives its charm to dangersâor to dressâ Three days of death for Freedomâor a dance!â Gia. Beware how in this light and reckless strain, To my impassioned countrymen you speakâ The inflamed, impetuous, hot Italians. Strive To cloak this playful and too trifling mood In strong enthusiasm's colouring garb, Else thou wilt shock their feelings, wound their pride, And harm in lieu of helping usâbeware! De Tours. Oh! trust me! I will stalk on glory's stilts, And mouth it most grandiloquently well! Without shows, helps, appearances, and names, Glory would grin too like a skeleton, And then the excursive fancy might take wingâ From honour's heightsâunto theâhospital! But truly, lovely countess, it needs not I should assume a zeal I deeply feel:â I am enthusiastic, though, perchance, You scarce can reconcile this truth with all That I have shown of recklessness and mirth. You are deceived, then! We gay sons of France Can snap our fingers ere we bind our woundsâ Catch at the red-hot cannon-balls that whizz Around us, shattering hundreds in their pathâ Dance o'er the gulph that yawns for our destructionâ Singâand defy the worldâor laugh and leave it. Gia. I doubt ye not, but such mixed character Is so unlike the temper of this clime, Thou yet must act a partâor wiltâI feelâ. If not, thou wilt bring ruin on us all!â Now to the apartments in my palace, sir, I pray thee, follow me;âif time permits, There learn the measures we have taken lateâ The methods we proposeâthe means we boast. It wants, methinks, to sunset yet an hour. De Tours. In all things thou but speakâlet me but serve. [Exeunt. Scene II. âAn Apartment, adorned with Statues, &amp;c. in the Count Montalba's Palace. EVA AND FLORA. Eva. Hath our young prince been lately here, I pray? Yes! thou'rt so beautifully blushful!âyes! I am entirely answered by those tints! Methinks his presence is indeed thy sunâ It leaves so rosy-red a track behindâ Nay! never shake those glist'ning ringlets thusâ To veil thy bright confusionâbrightlier through Their golden shadowings burns that blush of fire!â Come, come, be less deceitful!âand confess!â Flora. Nay, my sweet cousin, mock me not to-nightâ I have a brooding sorrow at my heart. And thou!âhow is't that thou canst jest and smile? Eva. Because I am too wretched for aught else! Did I give way 'twere more than I could bearâ Besides, I'm learning smiles to soothe and cheer himâ My poor Montalba!âNo! I dare not dwell On this dark theme:âin mercy talk to me! Tell me of all that hath befallen! thou saidst But now, a sorrow had o'erta'en theeâwhat? Nought but the shadow of mine ownâI trust! Flora. And that, my Eva, were enough to cross My happiest fortune with a cloud of gloom. Butâin additionâIâno! he I meanâ That isâ'twas sheâ Eva. Now let me spare thee all The avowal of thy love! thou know'st I know it! Flora. Ev'n so! thou dost!âthence spring my sorrows then. The worm is at my heartâthe envenomed worm That gnaws its way through all things!âjealousy!â Eva. Of whom?â Flora. Of herâthat proud Giacinta!â Eva. Her?â Flora. None other! Yes! he hath been here, and the hour He staid with me spake nothing but her praiseâ Prideâtortureâanger locked my lipsâcloseâcloseâ But if they uttered not, my aspect did!â He marked it not!âand still spoke but of her, Coupling her name with sounding epithetsâ Proud!âglorious!âgenerous!âOh! I know not what; But know I echoed each with smothered sighs That broke my heart to heaveâmuch more to check!â Alas! sweet Eva!âthou didst bid me talk, And of myselfâbut heartless doth it seem, And coldly selfish, while thy heavier woe Works in thy soul, and wakes distraction there. How sunken is thine eyeâthy cheek how changedâ A sleepless night of watchings was thy last? How fared it with the count? Eva. He could not rest: Starting from sleep whene'er sleep half o'ercameâ And uttering wild and dreadful thingsâas threats 'Gainst haunting fiends; implorings, sad and deep, To unseen beingsâstrange, delirious things, That seemed to me but ravingâravingâallâ Oh! pitying Heaven support me! Flora. Hark!â'tis him. Gia. Him!âthen the wretched hypocrite must feign, Freeze back the tear, and coin the writhing smile.â Once more, oh! pitying Heaven! support me!â Enter Montalba. Mont. Gone! Say! is he gone?âhe haunts me day by day, And multiplies that image in my dreams. What!âare ye voiceless both?âSay is he gone?â Flora. Whom mean'st thou?â Mont. That avenging shape of wrathâ Clothed in the horrid beauty of that likeness. (Checks himself.)Nay!âI am wanderingâmany sleepless nights Have fevered me to hot delirium's heightâ I mean, is Guido gone?â Flora. An hour ago!â Mont. I breathe! It is too muchâtoo much to bear Withinâwithoutâso haunted with that formâ Oh! I were happiest of all men, if he Were but removed for ever from these eyes! Flora, (aside to Eva.) Can he be jealous of the youthful prince? Can that be cause of all his wildnessâsay?â [Exit Mont. Eva. Oh! no!âno!âno!âWould 'twere so! but thou know'stâ This had beginning ere Prince Guido came. Flora. Aye; but far worse and worse hath he become, From the first moment that they met till now; And thou wert ever gracious to the youth, Thinking to please Montalba, and to prove Thy sympathy with him, and kind respect, For the most mournful memory of his loveâ By such sweet courtesy and favour shownâ I trustâI trust 'twill prove but jealousy, Which burns so fiercely in this fervid airâ Some slight distemperature, perchance, at first, Which strange uneasy fanciesâwearying caresâ Some trouble, some vexation's strife have causedâ (In private or in public mattersâwhich, Lest it should irk thee, he concealed from thee!) Might have disturbed the mind's nice equipoiseâ On this would jealousy engrafted grow Quickly to horrid strengthâthus sown by chance, Even from light-scattered seed should spring apace!â For where the soil hath loosened beenâupturned By aught of harassing suspense or doubt, Rank weeds too well do thrive and swiftly sproutâ Eva. I cannot hope it! No!âit is not that! Enter Montalba again. Mont. Ha! he hath not returned; for that thank Heaven!â Eva, did I inform thee I had heard From my loved friend of boyhood's years?âthat friend I ever told thee 'twas my dearest wish That thou shouldst meetâand valueâas do Iâ Brave Della Moria!âwho hath entered late A foreign serviceâand a bright career Hath run already: he will be in Rome This time to-morrow. Flora. (aside to Eva.) He is calmed and changed. Eva. (aside to Flora.) Yes! But 'twill never last!â (To Count Mont.)You told me not, Beloved Enrico! But I do rejoice To learn these tidingsâand impatient feel To show thy friend I love himâfor thy sake. Thou oft hast told me of the warmthâthe depth Of this true friendshipâthat he knows thy soul, Which hoards no secrets from himâ Mont. Wouldâoh! wouldâ How said I? he had fought!âYes! he hath been 'Mid Battle's noble terrors and array!â The warsâthe warsâah! there my pathway lies! Give me that glorious occupation's joy!â I would plunge deep into the shades of strife, Pierce through the nodding, plumy forest's ranks, Like to the crashing thunderbolt of heaven, And riot in the luxury of a choice, 'Twixt many a rapid death!âAye! war's hot field!â Why! 'tis the very capital of Death!â The spears, blood-gilt, his palace's proud pillars!â The rustling banners his resplendent roofsâ The heaps of slain his monumental piles. The Wars are in my Soul!âOh! let me burst These cold, enslaving bonds of peace, and rush, Free as the cataract rushes, on and on; And dash as that doesâto destruction's depths!â Here there yawns no abyss for those would fling The vain world offâand leave life too behind them! Ah! my own Eva! look thou not so sad!â 'Tis in my nature this most wild unrest, And ever and anon disgust at life!â Thou smil'st!âMy sun of life smiles round thy lips Though with the rosiest reddening of a setting!â It cannot wholly setâwhile beams that smile! [Exit. Flora. That smile! it fades with his departing steps, Like some crushed flower, that withers leaf by leaf. Eva. (despondingly.) I told you 'twould return on him ere longâ The unquiet fitâthe feverâand the fire. Flora. And yet methought, though true, his words were wild, There seemed no show, no startling signs nor marks Of real derangement!â'tis not hopeless, sureâ Some brief hallucination this may prove, That yet may pass and leave the horizon clear. Hope on!âhope ever!âNay! thou'rt weary quite: Thy tottering limbs can scarce thy frame sustainâ Seek some refreshment of repose, I pray. Eva. Repose!âthou mock'st me!â Flora. For his sakeâhis sakeâ If thou wert ill where then his nurse?âhis friend?â His comforterâ Eva. His keeper!âthere's the word!â Curdle! my bloodâmy pulse! check, check thy play; For this tops the uttermost of horror's worst! Flora. For his sake comeâfor his sake follow meâ Let these poor aching temples for awhile Press the still pillowâfor his sakeâhis sake!â [She gently leads out Eva. Scene III. âA lower Apartment in Count Montalba's Palace. ANTHONY, ANTONIO, AND GIACHIMO. Antho. 'Tis an oppressive dayâI scarce can breathe; I' faith, the climate's very sultry nowâ And our lord count is very strange, methinks. 'Tis hot unbearably, I vow and swear, Inside and outside too o'the houseâjust now!â Too hot to hold me, were't not for the sake Of my sweet Lady Evaâgentlest lamb! Heard you the thunder-storm this morning roll O'er this old, ricketty, ruinous Rome, I warrant, (This subterraneous, strange, amphibious place!â) As though 'twould shake those few old bonesâthat seem'd Quite out of joint enough beforeâto pieces!â Your temples of Jew-Peter and the rest? I am glad they had the decency to give The Christian Peter a good thundering new one!â Pheugh!â'tis so hot!âthere is no breathing here! I feel half strangledâstifled in my clothes.â Giach. (Walking round him and surveying him!) I wonder not! poor Anthony! no doubtâ They feel uncomfortably strange to you! Especially in this hot weather, now:â 'Twere better you took off your coat, methinks. Antho. You're about right! I vow I think so too! (takes off his coat.) Giach. Your waistcoat's doubtless sadly in your wayâ Suppose tooâyou divest yourself of thatâ Antho. Well!âI have no objectionâso here goesâ(takes off his waistcoat.) Why! you young hang-pup!âWhat art grinning for? Did'st never see a stalwort man, like me, A proper man of portly make and mouldâ Take off his waistcoat on hot days before?â Why! what art after?âRound and round you step As in a millâthe tread-mill were your place, I wish for your sake 'twereâwith all my heart. Giach. And you my comrade!âTony!âwell and good!â But Anthony, poor Anthony!âI feelâ Indeed I do, I feel for you!âAlas!â How awkward must that chafing collar prove! Antho. You'd think the halter pleasanter, perhaps?â Ha! ha! What we're brought up toâthat you know!â Giach. Not I.âIf you prefer it I would run And fetch one that should suit you. Speak the word! There may be one all ready made for you! Antho. Thou frontless impudence!âkeep off!âkeep off! Giach. Nay!âcool and comfortableâ'twere be sureâ And economical!â'twould save all washing! Now do, dear Anthonyâdo let me run! Antho. Brat!âSave all washing!âSave a murder!âBabe!â Runâyes!âI'll run you through with this good cane!â (Shakes a cane at him.) Be off, or you're a double-dead baboon! Tramp!âtramp! Giach. I feel such pity for your case! Those cramping stockings!âthose confining shoes!â That shirt's vile bondage!âpoor, poor Anthony!â Antho. If you can find, by rummaging within That numskull, hoisted on your two lank shouldersâ One small groat's-worth of brain, and that can boast One grain of meaningâgive it me at once!â Giach. Poor Anthony!âWe know you ne'er were used To wear a thread or shred of clothes before! But smeared with paint, ran wild in your old woods! You ancient Britons!â Antho. Ancient Britons! Ho! Am I an ancient Briton?âMongrel!âI! I am no ancient Briton!âgrant me patience!â Do I look like an ancient Briton?âfool! Giach. Oh, no! in truth, most young, and fresh, and green! But want a leetle painting o'er afresh,â Just a few brightening touches of the brush! For here and there the paint's turned slightly rustyâ Just needs fresh varnishing, perhapsâor scouring!â Antho. Painting! I'll paint you sirrahâblack and blueâ Good black and blue!âin stripes three inches broad: What scouring?âI'll scour your thick skin, and scourge it, Ape! Ancient Briton! heard man e'er the like?â Giach. (coaxingly,) Come! Anthony!âyou knowâyou know 'tis true!â They wear no clothes in England!âand you know Dear Anthony! your fingers are your forks! Your tables are your kneesâyou keep no cooks! You ante-diluvian Druids nothing eat Save husks and acorns, and do dwell in dens;â And once a year are roasted in brass bulls, Which gives your nameâJohn Bull. Come don't be shyâ Don't be ashamed of your own country, now! Let's have it out, all friends together here! Dear Anthony! good Anthony, take heart! Antho. (Running after him with his cane, trying to hit Giachimo, who nimbly avoids him; he has done thus during the latter part of Giachimo's speech,) You scaramouch!âyou scarecrow!âWhy, you scrap! You chuckling popinjay!âyou chattering pie! You ounce!âyou patch!âyou shred!âyou thing!âyou nothing! You slippery eel!âyou elf!âyou eft!âyou emmet!â Anatomy!âabortion!âkeep your distance, Or you are condemned! killed! dead and buried! burnt! Singed with quick lime, till nothing quick's left of you! And nothing dead besides, you oaf!âyou owl!â And dug up, and dissectedâlimb by limb, If those long spillikens be limbs indeed! I'll scarify you! pulverize you!âPuppet! Squeeze you to air and atoms!âstuff you, show you!â Make you a bottle-impâand seal you up! Cork you so tight, you'll leave your skittish tricks! Or flay you here alive, and sew your skin Into a likely bag for backy snuff!â That all the world may sneeze at you!âyou shrimp! Anto. Now Anthonyâcome, come, be coolâbe cool.â Antho. I wish I could in this hot furnace-clime. Giach. (To Antho.) You would look grand now in a gilded frame, New plastered o'er with coat of paint, I wot! That coat of many colours fitting close.â A fine old full-length painting all alive: Not a rude villainous daub, smeared coarsely o'er. Though I should doubt your native artists' taste; Now, what is't called titâtatâtat-tooing, heigh?â Antho. Won't I tat-too you, tag-rag!âHopâtom-tit! Or you are trounced and made mincemeat of!âHow!â You odd! you end! you farthing's-worth of frippery! You dolt!âyou dunce!âyou chimpanzee-faced changeling! Why, who hath filled that poor pin's head of yours With such unconscionably trumpery trash? Giach. (gravely.) Good father Anastasio!âlearned is he; Hath all your history at his fingers' ends! Antho. Would I could have him at my fingers' ends!â Brass bulls and acorns!âShall I go stark mad?â (Mimicking him)Good father Anastasio!âGood for what? For pounding in a mortar, I'll be sworn.â Well! one part of his name's appropriate too. Anto. What part? Antho. An ass.âYou're one tooâif you doubt it. Druids and husksâgood Lord! i' faith I'm husky, Wasting my breath on such a raw racoon; You will-o'-the-wisp, without one glimmering sparkleâ You Jack-a-dandy, with your toy-shop toggery.â Anto. Come Anthonyâforgive this foolish child!â And tell us, were you, after all, in time To see the grand procession yester eve? Saw you the carriagesâthe cardinals?â Antho. Not I!â'twas so insufferably hot,â Like some sick superannuated snail, Or tortoise with rheumatics pinchedâI crawled! And scarce could drag my melting limbs along; But for musquitoes was your country made,â And you're but menâandâ(turns to Giach.) monkeys by mistake. Anto. You saw not, then, the long and proud array? The carriages of stateâthe cardinals? Antho. The carriages;âbut not the cardinals: (By far the best of it, I'm thinkingâha!) These, having shot their rubbish, were returning, And lumbered byâ Anto. Their rubbish!âdare you speak With such irreverent disrespect of men So heaped with honours, and so grey with years?â Antho. Irreverent! well!âbut cardinals are clay;â And being worthy priests, too, would admire The choice expressionâsince they surely preach To all that flesh is grass, and man is dustâ And must despise their earthly part, no doubt. Now do not interruptâunmannered trick! They lumbered by, and wanted greasing much: Also new hanging:ânay, best give them up, Perchance for firingâthat's, the carriages! They trundled past with all their gilded show, With all their ponderous pomp and solemn state, Since troth they creaked and rumbled awfullyâ While their black steeds, fat, fat as butter all, Reminded me a leetle of our breed Of huge dray-horses!âhad the cardinals Indeed been in the coaches these had looked For all the world like Meux and Co.'s turns outâ Since they're stout portly gentlemenâI heard, And the round burly barrels filled with beer Might claim the honour well to represent! Anto. Hast to our glorious Colosseum yet Ere turned thy stepsâthat wonder of our Rome?â If not, thou must some day, despite the heat, Permit me to accompany thee there!â Antho. I have been to your Colosseum, troth!â An 'twere called Cauliflower 'twere nigher truth! Such a great round plum-pudding-looking place: Save it hath no plums in'tânor nought so good! Anto. PshawâSurely you must now one point concede, In England, you can boast not such a ruin! Antho. In England!âNo!âNo!âtake your oath of that! And fear not you will be forsworn!âyou're right!â In England no such ruins can we boast; For rest assured, we should be most ashamed To leave such littering rubbish straggling thereâ A huge great heap of half-cemented stones;â Gigantic nuisance!âblocking up the path, And quite an eye-sore in the prospect too!â In England, long ago, be very sure, 'Twould have been knocked to piecesâcleared away, And carted offâwith all the opened ground, To let for building-leasesâlongâlong since! We are an orderly, decent peopleâwe! We are a notable nation!âwith some taste.â For yours!âbut this I do not doubtâ'tis not So much your fault as your misfortune here; You cannot well afford the expense 'twould be, Removing all your gimcrack old remainsâ Making a decent, habitable place Of this rag-fair of odds and endsâthis Rome! In England!âwhy by this time you should see, I' the place of that old tottering skeleton, That mummy of a mountain of piled stones; That heap of useless lumber,âhalf decayed; That mouldering carcase of a Colly-see-um, Some sweet, straight, little comfortable rows Of snug, nice houses, speedily run up, With lath and plasterâneatly white-washed o'er, With Lilliputian gardens, well laid outâ With box and baizeâthat isâI mean with grass;â By courtesy so called, though truth to say, More like a remnant 'tis of well worn baize!â Nebuchadnezzar would have starved there, sure!â And on one side a Cupid and a rock, On 'totherâa proportionate bower to matchâ And all as spruce and pleasant, clean and neat, As bricks and mortar, paint and wood can make it. Anto. (laughs.) Ha! ha! ha! Giac. (laughs.) Ha! ha! ha! Antho. What makes ye laugh?â I do assure you I am serious quiteâ For we shrewd Englishers like all reforms, And know too how to make themânone so well. (To Giach.)Young Dunderheadâgive o'er! would I could send The upholsterer to your upper stories there, (points to his head,) Which want complete new furnishing, I doubt!â But Tony O! now, I will confessâof old Your countrymen, to judge them by their dwellings, Must have been proper men of portly size, That house of theirs seemed built for Gog and Magog!â Who have we here? Enter two Mendicant Friars, with small boxes for charity in their hands. What want these shaveling monks? Anto. They ask your charityâfor they collect Alms for the poorâgratuitously given. We have no poor-law unions here in Rome! Antho. Heaven bless your pope and cardinals for that! There you may boastâthere, there you're happy!âyes, Your beggars may be poorâbut proudâsince free!â But poverty and prison tooâthink!âboth! One is enough of suffering, and too muchâ Anto. Alas! our poor are heavy sufferers oft,â And like to starve e'en in the public streets!â Antho. Starve!âStarve!âbut you know not the scantiest fare On which our pauper-poor are kept alive; Enough to feed their hunger, not themselves!â And, oh! the famine of the feelings! torn, In age and in decrepitude, from all Whom they would live with to the last. Anto. But yet The houseless poor of Rome by hundreds die.â I have seen families of skeletons!â Antho. (interrupting.) Then let them dieâso they may die together! First Monk. Ah! Eccelenza!â Antho. Stop his gibberishâpray!â Second Monk. Oh! per i poveri! Antho. Old psalm-singing shark! The poor, quoth he!âwhy deuce a bitâI guessâ Will they e'er see the colour of my coin, That is, if I entrust it to their care.â No! no! most worthy friars!â'tis vain! 'tis vain! Commit no trespass here on button park!â(Laying his hand on his pocket.) You look so plumpâmy partridges!âI doubtâ I doubtâthe money all melts down your throats!â Ye are indeed no pale anatomiesâ Ye scarce can move for superincumbent flesh! Your larder looks out from your pursed-up eyes, That peer o'er two thick walls of solid fat!â Flesh, fowl, and fishâbut of the latter least! Or I most hugely am mistaken.âNo!â A good half-handful I bestowed this morning, On a poor beggar woman's seven starved brats.â First Monk. Ah! Carita! Antho. What! carry it her!âMy friend! Nay! not so fastâyou are too obliging!ânow, With your good leave, I'd rather do it myself! Though much beholden to your reverence, Sir. Second Monk. Oh!âBenedicite! Antho. What means the man? Translate for me, good St. Antonio!âpray! Anto. Why!â'tis a blessing on thee!â Antho. Is it so? I'll trouble youâmy very worthy Sir, Not to give me your blessing!âI mean, sell itâ (It costs too much; they never give it gratis!â) (To Antonio.) Now, in the twinkling of a bed-post, mark!â How I will send these two impostors hence.â This porpoise with a string of beads on's neckâ And that fat feather-bed in spectacles! (To Monks.) You speak a little Englishâfriends!âI think?â First Monk. A vary little of the tong, signor, But comprehend it when 'tis plainly spoke. Antho. I'll speak it plain enow!âI thought as muchâ The cunning varlets! They have learnt our tongue That they may cheat us, and delude us thus.â Poor generous, innocent, munificentâ Soft-hearted, charitable Englishmen! I have a proposition now to make, Nayâtwoâthe first, good monks!âbut stay awhile. You understand meâthat I do decline To make your reverences my almoners! I like to give what I do give myself, And not by proxy!âFor yourselves, of course, You nothing ask, nor need;âyou're well to do In this wild world, and want for nothing,âeh? And certain, have no cause for saving, since Through shaving, you've no hair apparent left. Excuse this joke, ha! ha! You cannot take it! Well! to proceed! Pray honour me to-night By staying supper with me,â Both the Monks together Si! Si! Si! Antho. See! See!âNay just hear firstâ(the hungry hounds!)â This happens to be Friday.âNow I know You keep to-day most strict and solemn fast!â I would not lead you, for the world, astray! And for your supper will with care provide,â Just half a herringâhalf a one a-piece! (Monks start back.) Too much, you think!âperhaps indeed it may!â Now I bethink me;âwell, a quarter! say! Lest you infringe your order's rules severe: I would not prove your tempter!âheaven forfend! And for the sake of your two precious souls, I will myself the other half devour!â A quarter of a herring each!â'twere best. For my good share a separate board prepared, May smoke with soup, and meat, stew, roast, and boiled; Choice maccaroniâvermicelli tooâ And other savoury and well-seasoned fare! Nay!âstop!âwhat going?â'tis near supper-time!â Come back!âyou reverend worthies!âpray return;â You can conclude your charitable walk By pensive moonlight!âD'ye remember notâ Two propositions I'm prepared to make;â The second I feel sure you both will hail With joy unfeigned, (Monks come forward,) but I must first unfold Unto your sympathizing souls, a thing Which doubly will delight you. I do feel Strange visitings within meâconscience-qualms; A leaning to your creed;âin short I own Am half a convert nowâand would become, With your good help, a whole one. First Monk. Well! my son! Antho. I have heard much of scourgings, stripes, and blowsâ And self-inflicted penances for sin;â Fain would I see, with mine own eyes, such acts Of piety performed! Behold my friends, (Produces two thick old whips,) A scourge a-piece. When you have swallowed down Your bones of fishâfor little else you'll find!â You may begin your flagellations here; Feed on them with what relish best you may, 'Twill aid digestionâwholesome labour, sure! And lay on till the morningâif you will! I will assist you when you're faggedâand flag,â So show me how you mortify the flesh!â Come! Monks. Buona Sera! Antho. Bony share, ah!âYes, It was a bony share I proffered you!â Andâ(Monks go) no use preaching more to empty benches! And (turns to Giach.) brains still emptier! Oh!âthose fat old thieves!â Pickpockets! swindlers!âbut I served them out!â They'll come no more to meâor if they do, No more self-thrashings will I thus propose, But with my own good hand administer! Now, Tony O!âand you Jacky!âCome with me!â 'Tis supper-time indeed, (looks at watch,) seven seconds past! Those whining rascals have been cause that we Shall lose seven seconds and one half of supper! [Exeunt all. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âAn Apartment at the Countess di Castellanaria's Palace. Morning. COUNTESS DI CASTELLANARIA and EVA. Gia. And wilder still hath he appeared of late?â Eva. Alas! I deem so,âday by day, methinks More fiercely troubled grow his looks and words! His words!âtoo fearful oft to dwell upon!â The Horror, that is heavy at his heartâ Will have its way.â Gia. (starting.) How! hath he told thee all?â Eva. What told me?âoh, no!ânothingâsave by sighs!â Great heavens! hath he told thee?âthou'rt pale and changed! Gia. 'Tis but the heat!ânayâpity's pang for thee!â That wrings my very heart!â(Aside.) Now must I strive To urge her to that end must be accomplished!â (aloud.)I see but one hope left, and that isâ Eva. (eagerly.) What? Gia. For thee to penetrate his bosom's depthâ Possess thyself of whatsoe'er may be The armed monster-image of his morbid thought, For be thou sure some wild distempered dream Lies at the bottom of this sea of strife. First, thou this hideous phantasy must sound Ere thou canst soothe him.âTrust me!âthere is a hope, If this can be achieved! A much loved friend Of mine, at Veniceâlong a sufferer thusâ Even by these means, was gradually restoredâ Without professional assistance quite. Whene'er he opens unto thee his soul, Soothe him, and seek to shape thy tone by his; Administering such comforts and such balm As thou mayst best devise.âHast thou observed That aught, or any one, especially Rouses his fevered fancy's fury? Eva. Yes! 'Tis since young Bellafiore hath been here, There hath been increase of his maladyâ Constant and swift progressionârapid growth Of each most dreadful symptom!â Gia. Ha!âindeed!â And do they ofttimes meet?â(aside,)âmy jealous heart! Silenced in suffocating stillness lie! Doth Guido much frequent your princely home? Eva. Nay, seldom is he absent!â Gia. So!âWhat cause? Eva. Hast thou not guessed, nor heardâsweet Flora's eyes Shine the bright load-stars that attract him there: He is devoted to her gentle charms!â Gia. Distraction!âthatâthat is,âI mean to sayâ Distraction through all stages still requires The kindliest care and tenderest watchfulness. Follow my counsel to the letter, now, And then report to me how thou hast sped. I do rejoice to hear your cousin hath Stolen the proud, fiery heart of Bellafiore!â 'Twill be a brave alliance for herâtroth! Through his lamented sister's mournful death Is he sole heir to vast possessions, left By a most wealthy mother to the daughter; Or rather by the grandsire, who bequeathed His treasure to his daughter's daughterâborn In time to be the idol of his age, And failing her, to any after issue. Thus Guido hath enormous mines of wealth!â Alas! thou heed'st me scarce; thy wandering thought Is hovering o'er Montalba's suffering head!â Be mindful, I implore thee!âact thy part With firmness and decisionâ'twill succeed! Eva. Rest thou assured I will!âI now must bend My sorrowing steps to my unhappiest home, Yet something soothed by that thou hast held out, Of reassurance to my sinking heart! Farewell my kind Giacinta! Gia. Sweet!âfarewell!â [Exit Eva. Detested worm! but I will crush thee yet! And feast upon thy writhings and thy pangs! Doubly I hate for this vile news thou'st brought!â Torture and anguish!âHave I lost him?âNo! I will not lose him.âShe hath lovelinessâ And there is all!âthat sums her wealth at once!â Have I no loveliness?âand add to that, A soul of fireâa heart like Passion's Sun, A-blaze with gorgeous treasures of delight!â Then have I aids and adjunctsâgolden keys To the heart's coffered coreâambition!âpride! Excitement!âpatriotism!âYetâoh!âyet I will be conqueror in these lists of love! But would to heaven Montalba's dark affair Were to the issue brought!âtill then I stand As on the brink of an abhorred abyssâ And all athirst for vengeance, which my lip, Hot as the vampire's to the dregs would drain!â Aye! with their life-blood crimsoning in the draught!â Montalba!âHa!âhadst thou but wedded me, Stead of that pale-faced puppet yonderâthen That sharp remorse which cuts with trenchant edge, Through thy pierced soul, were swallowed up,âwere merged In thousand mightiest interests!ânot an hour Should have gone o'er thy head, without its freight Of stirring keen excitements!âSo shouldest thou Have lost Thyself, and Memory, and Remorse, And lived one hurrying life of restlessness!â Whirled in one vortex of o'erwhelming strife!â I had built up between thee and the Deed That shakes thy soul to think on, dazzling walls;â That with their splendour and their loftiness, Had shut the fearful shadowy spectre out;â My hated rival's self is my revenge; She leaves him to the tyranny of his thought!â To that dread pow'râthat fiend of fiendsâourselves!â He should be roused!âfired!âwildly borne along Adown the flashing rapids of excitement. She lets him stagnate in reflection's lake, Which glass one image, and one colouring wear. Enter Giulio. Giu. Giacinta!âart prepared to meet thy friends?â Gia. Entirely! let them be admitted straightâ And stay,âmark! Giulio, I have late received This fresh provision of stout arms!âbehold! (Opens a large cabinet.) 'Tis a fair store, besides what are already Distributed without reserve, I'm told, Among the heads and leaders in theâplotâ No, noâthe imperial and heaven-sanctioned war! Didst say they were at hand? Giu. They wait thy will. Gia. Conduct them instantly, I pray thee, here. [Exit Giulio. Oh! Guido! Guido!âshall I see thee now? Courage, my heart! and cope with this strong joy! Enter Giulio with De Tours, Guido, and Conspirators. Gia. (to De Tours.) I trust thou hast acquaintance made with these Right gallant champions in our lofty cause. De Tours. Nay, madam, I have had acquaintance, late, To make with things not such good company, But of necessity that must be seenâ Your Romish ruins, vast and wondrous! Led By Curiosity and Cicerones, I have explored the entire old cityâfaith! In two hours and a halfâthank, heaven, 'tis done, A wearying taskâbut one must see those things!â Each several town I reached, in my late travel, Exclaimed I to my courier, fervently, âPietro! I trust there's nought here to be seen;â Museums, churches, pictures, ruins, nor galleries, Shrines, prisons, palaces, nor catacombs;â But for my sins had seldom such good luck. A traveller's trade is most fatiguing! Giu. Well!â We must to business.âCountess! hast thou gained Due information late from Lombardy? Gia. Most satisfactory!âE'en like wild-fire, there, The electric spirit's kindlingly aroused!â Swiftly and suddenlyâthe storm-wind's speed!â The blow should scarce be long deferred, I deem, But taken at the tideâthe popular zeal,â Lest that the generous ardour which inspires, Should suffer chill abatement. Now!âstrike now!â And we shall chain success! Guido. (aside.) Oh! queen-like voice!â Its silvery championship might pierce proud way Through banded legionsâand all-conquering win The battle with one word! (To Gia.) Thou, lady! thou, That like creation's empress, stand'st girt round With all the appanage that fits ambition, As all the ambrosial attributes of beautyâ Dost like a radiant prophetess foretell, And with thy conquering smile ensure success! Giu. (aside.) By Heaven! he loves her! madness and despair! Gia. My noble cousin,â'tis enough to nerve A poor weak woman, to behold around her Such gallant sons of glorious chivalry, Panting to give their country all she needs To make her yet the loftiestâLiberty! Guido. Thyself art all a Heavenly Chivalry!â Now I conceive how white-robed angels warred!â Gia. Hear me but welcome thee with heart and soul, To our resolvÃ©d band!âfor thou hast all That most is needed in so high a quarrel!â A soul to do and dareâand to defy A world in arms, for thy wronged country's sakeâ Devotion to that countryâtrue and lealâ Aspirings lofty as thy plumy crest, Bright with red sunshine of the thousand wars, Where thy brave lion-fathers fought and bled, And honour stainless as those hundred 'scutcheons, Whose blazonries adorn thy princely house. Courage, that eagle-plumed, ne'er checked its flight, Genius to promptâand judgment to arrangeâ And power to execute the noblest ends! Be thou the God-given star to lead our war. Thy nameâthy fame's a very victory-cry! Giu. (aside.) Ye gods! she loves him!âlet me hate them, both! Guido. Nay! madam!âmy poor merits you o'errateâ (aside.)'Tis too like flattery this, and doth not please me: It looks like some designâsome studied wile. Giu. Are we met here to waste the precious time In petty compliments?âthe day!âthe dayâ The hourâthe placeâthe signalâall's prepared. A simultaneous rising were the best, In different quarters.âAye! it must be so! Not in one point concentrated can we Assemble our brave forces; but the when, The how, the whereabouts, must we discuss, And speedily press on.âShun, shun delay!â First Conspirator. And we, young nobles of this glorious land, Like champing coursers, scarce can bear the bit; But be the word once spoken, and we spring, With one proud bound of rapture, to the field, To stamp the foot on crushed oppression's neck! De Tours. Be careful that you do not break your own In such a headlong leapâsuch things have chanced. Second Consp. Swell out the thundering triumph of the acclaim! Let the loud battle-cry go echoing on! Let the earth heave victory-rocking round our steps, Till every nation answers ours, and starts To giant-stature up, aye!âsword in hand, The armed nations shall start up, and tow'ring stand, And thenâ(pauses.) De Tours. What then? then all sit down again. Second Consp. Pshaw! trifling!â(Turns to Guido.) Seems this hero of young France Scarce fired, methinks, with that high energyâ Those keen aspirings that should prompt and steel In such an undertaking as our own! Guido. Thou hast given utterance to my brooding thought! First Consp. I will not stay to hear him desecrate Our theme of themes with his irreverent tongue! [Exit First Consp. Third Consp. Now, now let the everlasting deed be done!â Oh! for one swift hour of the earthquake's mightâ One moment of the storm and thunderbolt! Come to the true, bright vineyard!âwar's red stageâ Come forth! ye vintagers!âin rushing throngsâ Come, ye grape-gatherersâho! the grapes are ripe. De Tours, (shrugging his shoulders.) I hope and trust we shall not find them sour! Nothing would less surprise me, I confess. Also, Heaven grant, the wine of this fine vintage May not unsettle seriously our headsâ(feels his own.) Mine feels a thought unsteady on my shoulders!â A bosom-friend of mine, but the other day, At Paris, bent on some refined amusement, Met with an awkward accident. Guido. And what? What happened to thy friend? De Tours. The guillotine! That's all!âa trifleâbut it spoilt his beauty, Disturbed his morning's rest seven hours too soon; (On a cold, raw spring-morning scarcely pleasant!) Disordered much his dress, and marred his mirth!â This same good guillotine's a sharp-set friend. Like you your friends to cut you?âI do not! Guido. (to Gra.) He is a spy! He mocks our schemes, by heaven! He hath not at his heart our righteous cause. Gia. 'Tis but his reckless manner.âThis I know, He is the bravest, noblest, and most zealousâ The war-soul of young France is in his breast. These sallies are but smoke-wreathsâborn of Fire!â (To Guido.)'Twere best to shorten this our conferenceânow! I tremble, lest these headlong spirits chafe, Angered to meet so hair-brained an ally!â Already some, I mark, have disappeared!â (To the rest.)My lords, the proud conclusion yet shall come, The noble consummation of our hopes! But for short period must be yet deferred. Advices we expect from distant parts, And must yet pause till messengers return, Whom we've despatched to our wide-scattered bands.â Let the great act be instantaneous then!â Monies and arms in vast profusion poured Are secreted i' the hidden mountain-dens Of our brave brigands,âand the brigands all Well organized, and placed in certain posts, With understanding how they are to act, And how unite themselves together then, And to our party. Guido. Lady! heard I right? Brigands! saidst thou? Is't possibleâis't true? Gia. Aye! dost despise such tools?âThou'rt wrong, my prince! Scorn'st thou the swordâfor that its shining metal Was dug of old from disembowelled earth?â Thou must stoop low to find the staunchest help. 'Tis this base mould that gives our iron mail!â De Tours. Also a charming chiming toyâcalled goldâ Which moves the worldâand Archimedes' boast Turns into simple truth. Fourth Consp. I grieve to hear, Fair countess! we must yet curb in our souls, Impatient for their burst from hated bonds. But we obey.âThe thrice-blessed day will come!â And earth shall see that noblest spectacleâ A nation struggling for her proudest rights! In sooth, earth's mightiest spectacle!â De Tours. Most true!â That is the general aspect of the strife! Collectivelyânot individuallyâ For ugly accidents too oft occur, That rather spoil the beauty of the face, Unsuited to a delicate complexion:â But soldiers deal in Generalities! (And sometimes, slightly too, confuse their termsâ) A bodyâthat's ten thousand bodiesâsqueezed In some small compassâa large live machineâ Where the individual legs and arms and heads Go but to make the monster of the many!â Battle-arrayâwhat is't?âNo toilette, made With exquisite and graceful taste: no, no,â 'Tis but the order of the Army!âbut The appearance of the Millionânot o'the one, The studied, strict costumeâ'tis but the troops In uniform precision. By the wayâ Talking of uniformsâpray what is ours? What sort of tailors have you here in Rome? I vote the colour should be blue, dark-blue, The livery of cerulean Italy! What is the banner? First Consp. Say the tricolor! Freedom's own chosen rainbow for long years. De Tours. Not so! 'tis rather out of fashion now, And casts an unbecoming shade around. I saw a handsome standard-bearer once Beneath its inauspicious glare appear, Indeed, all colours of the rainbow!âSay Crimson!â'twere better much! Guido. (aside.) Insufferable! What frontless impudence!âwhat frivolous mirth. Giu. 'Twere better, lest some slight suspicions were, Haply, by your protracted stay aroused With the fair countess, here to separate now, Even without more delay! If ye approve, My noble friends! our watchword's still, âRienzi!â De Tours. I think you're right: we've been too long assembled. 'Twere dangerousâ(aside)âand grows rather tedious too. Farewell! most lovely amazonian queen!â Heed not my merrimentâthou'lt praise my mettle, When Franceâno! Italy and glory call, And all the young and brave go forth in joy. [Exeunt De Tours, Consp. &amp;c. Giu. (aside to Countess.) Giacinta! leave us. I have much to say To this young Bellafioreâmuch to teach. Scarce yet initiated, he requires Counsel and explanation, and likes not To seem in your eyes but a raw recruit. Gia. I go.âI fear this wild de Tours hath harmed Our solemn cause already!âthink'st thou so? Giu. I own I trembleâbut of this anon. [Exit Giacinta. Giulio goes to the Cabinet of Arms and brings two swords. Giu. Prince Guido, thou hast done me mortal wrongâ Thus give me reparation!âchoose thy sword! Guido. How done thee wrong?âfirst let me know the cause! Giu. Thou hast supplanted me with her I love, The beauteous countess!âNot a wordâenoughâ Defend thyself, or thou'rt a rank, base coward. They fight. Giacinta rushes in and flings herself between them. Gia. What noise!âhold, holdâwhy? Giulio! Guido, hear! Holdâhold, I say!âwhat mad, wild transport's this? Giu. I answer as I answered thee, Giacintaâ Ask thine own heart, and let that give reply. Gia. Put upâput up! for shame, ye recreant knights! The red-right arms your suffering country needs Should ye thus raise against each other?âshameâ Shall light, rude brawls disgrace, and mar, and stain The dignity of that we have to do?â Put up, I say, till that tremendous hour, Fraught with the destinies of thousands, then Leap forth those swords, like lightnings, from their sheaths:â Put up!âput up!âI charge ye fight no more, Or I will send, demanding a strict guard, This instant to the authorities and powers,â Then have ye bound in sureties to keep peace. Ten thousand shames on both!âquick!âquick! put up! If ye are leal staunch loyal knights.âBut swear, For my sake swear, and sacred guard your oath, You will not draw again:âbe quick!âswear, swear!â Giu. (sullenly.) I swear, since I have sworn before to make Thine every word my law. Guido. And I too swear:â I have no quarrel with Count Giulio!ânone!â Gia. 'Tis wellâonce more I leave you, and do trust Implicitly to your joint honour. (significantly) Peace! [Exit Giacinta. Giu. She hath thus sheathed our swordsâbut 'tis in vainâ We must not draw againâbut we may die! Let the survivor claim his radiant prizeâ Lo! thus let lots decide the question, ha!â Draw for the death-lotâ'tis the longestâlet Whichever of us twain draws that oneâdie! (He prepares lots.) Guido. Hold! Thou art mistakenâhast misunderstood. I do not love the countessâand yet more, I do adore another, and ere long Shall hail that other, as I hope, my bride! Giu. Indeed! Then give me thus to grasp thy hand: Wish me successâas I wish theeâthe same. Guido. I do most truly!âprosper in thy suitâ And woo and win and wearâthy gem of worth. I honour and admire the proud Giacintaâ But for my heartâanother reigneth there! [Exeunt together. Scene II. âAn Apartment at the Palazzo Ceria, (Count Montalba's.) FLORA AND PRINCE GUIDO.

What ails thee, Guido?âthou'rt abstractedâquiteâ Extremely silentâand a littleâdull!â Why! yesterday 'twas different all indeedâ Such flights of wild, tempestuous eloquence!â Such deep enthusiastic bursts of zeal!â Hast thou not seen thine inspiration's source And theme, the bright Giacinta, this fair morn? Guido. I haveâand am but now returned from her. Flora. Indeed! you pass great portion of your time Lackeying the haughty heels of that proud countess. Guido. Doth it displease thee that I go there oft? Flora. Oh! not at all!âwhy should it?ânot the least!â (Aside.)Why doth he ask?âto make me say theâuntruth? Better he'd tacitly imagined it! Guido. I much admire the countessâshe is all That poets paint when they pourtray a heroine. Flora. Yes! but we want not that in actual life. Methinks 'twere better she were soft and meek, Domestic,âquiet,âshe is far from that. What is her history?âtell it me, I pray; I know thou lik'st on that fair theme to dwell! Guido. I do admire herâthus much I confessâ Magnificently beautiful she is, And most imperially inspired of mien! And wouldst thou learn her hapless history? She married earlyâan untimely death Befel her youthful husband and a sad! I will relate it.â'Twas but some few months After their marriage, at the carnival At Naplesâriding 'mid the crowding masks, Through the Toledo-street, his horse took fright, Became ungovernableâreared and plunged, And threw its riderâpitching on his head, He was insensible when taken up, And after some few hours he breathed his last! His widow then acquired enormous wealth In Lombardy and here at Romeâherself Had large possessions of her own, besides, In Tuscany:âher unprotected state Hath given her character, perchance, a shade Of too much haughty independence, while Her means thus vast bringâ Flora, (interrupting him.) Dainty widow! faith!â But, Guido! art thou evermore to be The follower of Giacinta?âdost thou mean Thus frequently thy devoirs there to payâ Andâandâto keep me ever on the thorns And tenter-hooks ofâfriendly fears for thee?â Thou wilt repent this sudden freak, be sure! But answerâwilt thou do thus ever? Guido. No! Flora. Wilt thou not haunt her flaunting footsteps? Guido. No! Flora. Andâsayâdost thou not love Giacinta?â Guido. No! Flora. Nor with especial favour still regard?â Guido. Whyâno! no! no!âthou hast the reply direct! My sweet cross-questioner!âthy keen queries seem Put in a lawyer-like and business style: Wilt thou not goânor passânor visit there?â Nor loveâregardânor favour that fair dame?â The inquisitorial glance and tongue can I With most clear conscience thus unblenching meet! Now hear me, loveliest Flora!âI will own The dazzling witcheries of her queen-like charms Did for brief while enchain me at her feet, A worshipper at her triumphant wheels. Nay!âstart not! love was never in the case!â 'Twas admirationâwonderâalmost aweâ Not love, although it might have mellowed grown Into that bright emotionâbut for thee!â Thy sweet, sweet image rose between my soul And the rare beauty of Giacintaâtill It blinded me with hope and happiness! Flora. And thou art true and leal and loyal still?â Guido. Still, and for ever!âoh! my best beloved!â Yet other causes aided me to break The glittering chains that bound me at those wheels. Flora. And what?â Guido. It matters notâsince I am free!â Flora. Knows't thou 'tis bruited strongly, throughout Rome, That fair Giacinta, with her heroine charms, Is here the soul and centre of intrigueâ Regarded with suspicion and distrust By the surrounding governments, and chief By the Austrian.âI heard this averredâassuredâ But yestereveâwith hints that she is now Hedged round with plotters, plots and counterplots. This renders her society scarce safeâ She holds a court of all the wildest here And elsewhere!âdiscord's living firebrandsâyouths, Who, lacking occupations and professionsâ Are suffering with a surfeit of reposeâ And prompt to work some great and mighty change, Sith any change were luxury unto them! Sick with satiety of idlesse thus, 'Tis said too she would dare all things to reign, So high her fancy soarsâItalia's queen! I waste my breath!ânor you nor Eva bear To hear aught whispered 'gainst Giacinta's name, Yet from authentic sources fell these hints. Guido. These things may beâand yet such hints receive With cautious circumspection evermore. Report's a strange, wild babblerâtrust her not. I think the countess one whose lofty mind Is fired by strong ambitionâ'tis no crime!â She would exalt her land, and sow the seeds Of fair improvement in her country still. Thus much I thinkâand add to thisâdear love!â She is a warm, most fervent friend, I feelâ Devotedâzealousâcordialâand her heart Is open as the day. Flora. These things may be! Guido. What! my sweet silvery echo! dost thou doubt me? Nay!âthou art prejudicedâthou art indeed! Enter Eva. Eva. Guido, art thou acquainted with a youth, By name De Toursâwho comes, ere long, to bring Letters of introduction from Giacinta. Guido. I met him at her palace but to-dayâ (to Flora,)I have much to say to thee, my Flora!âmuch!â This evening wilt vouchsafe me, at my prayer, Long audienceâdear one!âdearest!âsay but yes! Flora. Well!âyesâterday thou wert engaged, methinks, In playing courtier near another throne!â Guido. Ah! unforgiving, cold, resentful, sternâ Flora. Enough!âthe catalogue grows lengthyâthusâ Of course most wearisome!âYes! yes!âthy queen Will deign vouchsafe thee audience! but once more Most seriouslyâmy Guido!âI beseech Thou wilt not be by this dark Circe led From honour's, wisdom's, love's fair paths astray. Guido. Never from love's!âis that not saying allâ Wisdom and honourâboth inclusiveâeh?â And virtue too and glory, and yet more, Untoldâintolerableâhappiness! This evening thenâthis ev'ning thou shalt hear What my heart yearns, and yet much dreads to speak. Oh tell me, tell meâthat thou lov'st me still! Flora. These lightning-shafts of jealousy have struck My heart, to reach and bare its bedded wealth, Dear love, of bright affections and emotions! So earth is torn,âere gleam her buried treasures! Guido. I hang on these sweet words, with more than joy! Enter De Tours. Eva. You are most welcome, Sir!âI understand, From the fair Countess di Castellenaria, Your stay in Rome must of necessity Be short.âIt grows our pleasing duty still To strive to make it pleasant;âbut I fear, So occupied will be your precious time, With strict research of all the treasures here, Of grave antiquityâyou scarce may find A leisure hour at Rome! De Tours. Nay!âMadamânay! I have explored the cityâmade my tourâ And may assume the travelled air of those Who, having run through ruins, toiled up towersâ (To swallow down the country at a gulp, With the fresh air that they imbibe on high,) Glanced round famed galleries!âdived down dungeons drear!â And posted through whole provincesâasleep! Assume the encyclopedian stare and strut!â And wrap in mysticism theirâignorance! Flora. You must have hurried strangelyâit should seem Two years are scarce enough to see all Rome! De Tours. Two hours suffice, believe me, if you have A perfect guide-bookâand a cicerone, In good condition for a swinging walk. Flora. Dear Eva! I entreat you not to stay; You have been suffering latelyâhad no sleep.â M. De Tours will condescend to hold Me your unworthy representative. De Tours. I urge! entreat!âimplore!âam shockedâo'erwhelmed!â For worlds would not detain you;âI beseechâ Eva. I feel small scrupleâpast my poor deserts Thus representedâtherefore, Sir, farewell!â [Exit Eva. Guido. [aside to Flora.] He is conceit itself, and my aversion! Farewell, sweet, till this evening!âfear me not!â [Exit Guido. Flo. I need not ask, if to St. Peter's yet You've made a fitting pilgrimage? De Tours. Of course!â That is, I peeped behind that ponderous curtainâ Which hangs ungracefully at the entrance;âglimpsed The interior for an instantâI must own (hesitating.)â Flora. (quickly,) You surely were not disappointed there? De Tours. Why! not exactly! though a little,âyes! It is too hugeâand too colossal much!â Too mountainous in its magnificence!â Quite the Mont Blanc of architectural works!â This is my feeling;â'tis a grand mistake To make an edifice of any kind, So vast and lofty as to throw i' the shade That noblest of all nature's objectsâman! 'Tis mortifying sure to feel oneself Dwarfedâstuntedâsupersededâput aside! A pigmy!âall our graces lost, or made Ridiculously Liliputian!âbah!â I would not for the world have past the curtain!â I marked two youthsâbefore they entered there I had observed themâtallâwell formed they seemed; Perfectly dressed, and with l'air noble too!â Will you believe me?âthey seemed wholly changed! Two little insignificant insects, lost On that great floorâlike the ocean's paven beach! All their elaborate toilette quite in vainâ Dwindled and dwarfed they shrunk at once to ev'n Minuteness microscopicâ'twere enough To crush the most egregious vanity. Not for the world would I have made, I swear, So poor an exhibition of myself! I am rejoiced I did not pass the curtain:â And then your voice seems lostâor gains a tone Of strange sepulchral hollowness. I doubt A jest would roll out to a requiem there! I'm thankful that I did not pass the curtain!â Flora. (smiling.) But i'st not good to wound one's vanity? 'Tis sinful to be vain!â De Tours. How!âsinful!âno! There you mistake! 'tis virtue to be vain!â All good emotions spring from vanity! Humility itself, for we do strive And canvass for opinions in our favour, Constitute all as judges of our looks, Our words, our works, our talentsâev'n our dress!â We love those who admire usâthence doth spring Philanthropy and charity besides! And few are pious too who are not vain!â For the upturned eyesâthe graceful attitudeâ The soft expression of the countenance All spring from gently prompting vanity! Dictatress true!âSeems conscience dumb to her!â Miscreants, and misanthropes, and misers all, Become so from a lack of vanity;â They study not what is becomingâpleasing! They hang not on opinion for their bliss! They spend not all to gain sweet admirationâ Oh! men grow heaps of vice that are not vain! Flora. A most convincing, excellent discourse! (Enter Montalba.) Allow me to present the Count Montalba. De Tours. (Bows.) Delighted!âCount! I am most proud! Mont. (Bows.) And I!â And hope and trust you ofttimes will consent To honour our palazzo with your presence! De Tours. Charmed! noble count, to cheat the laggard here! The tortoise-paced old loiterer, Time!âbelieve me!â Mont. âIs't true you're now upon your way to join The Egyptians 'gainst their foes, the Turks?â De Tours. I am! Mont. By heav'n! I envy you!âA noble strife, And a sharp contest!âAre you not on fire To take the field, and flesh your virgin sword! De Tours. Why! as to that, I know the smell of powder! Also, another warlike whiffâof lint! The unodoriferous scent of which is sickening! As to the field!âyour glorious field of war, 'Tis strangely like a rabbit-warrenâheigh? Chuck full of dangerous awkward holesâcalledâgraves! A sort of burrowing that is halfâa bore! Howe'er that beâI love it to my soul! And by good old St. Dennisâask no better Than there in strife to liveâin gloryâfall! We Frenchmenâsons and scions of the sword! You know of oldâaccustomed areâto die! Enter Servant. Servant. Count, the Marchese Della Moria waits. Mont. Usher him hither, and without delay! I met him in the Piazzaâbut a momentâ And then he promised me this visit.âSo! Enter Della Moria. My best dear friend!âten thousand welcomes here! Flora!âbecome acquainted with the man Who beggars all my praise and moreâesteem. Flora. I am most happy! De Tours. Let me say farewell. I have important business. (aside.) 'Tis too much!â This scene of sentimental friendshipâbah! [Exit De Tours. Flora. And I must seek my gentle Eva now! After your long estrangement from each other, You must have much to say!âI feel assured. [Exit Flora. Della Moria. I grieve to see, dear friend! how thou art changed! I scarcely knew thee, when we met, erewhile. Hast thou been ill? Mont. Oh, no! it is this life! Moria. What life? Mont. This life of dull stagnation here! Torpid inaction and repose,â'tis worse For aging one than any toil or strife! Moria. But thou art wedded unto one, of whom Report saith wonders!âNay!âI know she is Perfection!âfor I saw her but just now! Mont. Where saw her? Moria. Walking thoughtfully along I' the statue-gallery, with Prince Bellafiore! Mont. (aside.) Ha!âtorture!âtorture!â'tis a phrenzied thought! But I do wrong her!âno!âno!â'tis not so!â And so thou find'st me changed!âI marvel not. Oh! this do-nothing, frigid, fatal life! With nought to rouse or change the o'erwearied mood! I gaze on Rome's gray ruins till I wish For like decay!âor by the old river ride, Chiding thee, Tiber,âfor thy tardiness!â Nor Tiber onlyâbut yet tardier Time!â Moria. (aside.) He is most strange!âI understand it not! (To Mont.) Now for brief season we must part again!â I have much business on my hands, entailed By lengthened absenceâso farewell!âfarewell!â But for the presentâsince I purpose now Long to remain at Romeâand be you sure Shall much on you inflict my company! Mont. I will accompany your steps towards home! [Exeunt both. END OF ACT III.</field>

But rise! proud spirit!âyet be I the undoer!â Whate'er may chanceâwhate'er may checkâobstructâ I will still follow fate-likeâto the goal! I will make vengeance more sublimely dread Than ever 'twas before! and punish both, And punish all!âwith such infernal pangs As our own Dante never dreamed of.âYes! Come shame!âcome crime!âcome deathâdoomâruin's worst!â I will be staunch, and fixed as rocks and spheresâ Those to chastise who have defeated me!â Crime crowds on crime, now on my darkening path!â Ah!âthe first sin is all our own!âour own!â Our deed and doing!âplotting and performing!â But those that follow!âthose that follow!âthose Are forced upon us by the unpitying fiends. One crime is father to a catalogue!â I must reflect!âMy spy informs me now That Guido is devoted to that girlâ That hated Flora!âthat but yestereve He asked her to agree, at once, to espouse him! Saying, his father never would consent To such alliance with an alien from His country and religionâclime and blood; But that once solemnized, their nuptials should Be hailed by him, whose dearest wish on earth Was to see Guido with a self-chosen bride United happily before his death!â That then all the obstacles should slighter seem, The advantages more prominentâhe thus Choosing himself his brideâand finding one All youth and beauty, and with heart all his!â Thus muchâno more could he acquaint me with. Shall I, indeed, be thus befooled, betrayed A second time? Montalba!âthou accursed!â Didst thou not let me think myself beloved, When coldly thou didst court thy poor Bianca? And when my fiery spirit had found way, And taught thee how to cast her from thee!âthen, ThenâO! thou double-dyedâthou deadliest traitorâ Didst thou insult my love, destroy my hopes, Outrage mine every feelingâkeep aloof, And thenâand thenâdidst wed another! Wretch!â But the black reckoning-day is near at hand! And she too knows of this vile love of Guido's. Sheâthat most loathed, abhorred, and fatal wife!â 'Tis she hath fostered and hath fanned this flame, As sheâdetested scorpion!âwould contriveâ In every wayâmy ruin!âOut on her!â Guido! aye! thou hast played me false, thou hast! Thou hast deserted too our deep-sworn band!â Sent vague excuses, shiftingâpaltryâcold,â Though colourable messages.âBy Heaven! I will not bear thy dark desertion thusâ Of me and of my heart-dear cause at once! Soft! I have sent to pray an interviewâ Whatâho!âwithin there. Enter Servant. Hath Prince Guido been? Serv. No! gracious countess! I have seen him not. Gia. Then go!âno, stayâI will not thusâbegone. [Exit Servant. He cannot fail me, and he dare notâno! I yet shall have him in my powerâI must!â Slow hour!âwill thy dull sands ne'er run?âAha!â I hear his stepâhe comesâis't joy orâtorture? Enter Prince Guido. Guido. Fair countess! I obey theeâand am here But for short season!âsince affairs most urgent Elsewhere require my presence. Gia. I would fain We understood each other thoroughlyânow!â Art thou yet with us in this mighty plot? Guido. Countess! far worthier at thy hand await Their destinies chivalrousâI am not. Gia. What! Guido!âwhen so near our triumph's hour? Wilt thou desert usâfail us at our need, And at our noblest turn too?âWhy! 'twere shame And harsh wrong to thyselfâthine own brave selfâ As to thy bleeding country!âPrince! what cause? Guido. Lady! in rash, hot-blooded suddenness Did I, unponderingly and unprepared, Enrol myself among you!âcalmer thoughts Have visited my soulâit not imports That I should waste thy time by their detail. Gia. Give me one reason, (aside,) for thou hast but oneâ Thy slavish love for that poor, brainless chit, Flora Clanronald! with her soulless charms! Guido. Give thee one reason?âHear me!âthere is one Which were alone enough to establish me In this my purposeâwould my father bearâ Heâchief of our unstained and lordliest houseâ The representative of our proud raceâ For ever loyal, brave and true and honouredâ His son should be a rebel? Gia. This is but The household-jargon of despotic courts, The oiled, gilded, and vain terms of tyranny!â The old jugglery of Janus-faced oppression! Thy free, high mind should scorn it!âCome, oh! come Where HonourâFreedomâPatriotismâcall! And strike for millionsâcrouch not back for one, Though that one be thy father.âBut 'tis false!â 'Tis not for him thou so dost cower and crouch. Guido. Crouch!âSay what mean'st thou? Gia. (passionately.) That 'tis cowardice!â Rank cowardiceâtreacheryâbasenessâfalsehoodâshameâ Away!âI will not parley with thee, save This moment thou wilt change thy recreant tone, And sign this paper!â'tis the scroll that bears Our secret protestationâsign!âI say!â Guido. Thou preachest 'gainst all wrong and tyranny, But fain would practiseâis't not so fair dame?â Unheard-of despotismâand crush the soul! Chained at thy chariot-wheels for everâNO! Gia. Then trembleâtrembleâtraitor!âfor thou art lost. Thou mock'st meâsupercilious smiler! how?â Guido. Methinks 'tis thou shouldst tremble!âwhen a word, A breath of mine could shake thy schemes to air, And give thee to the Austrian dungeon's gloom. Gia. Do! 'twere well worthy of theeâthose were deeds To gild thy family's proud heraldry With honours in august accession.âLo! The craven!âthe betrayer!âand the informer!â (Bursts into tears.) Alas!â'tis madness!âGuido! pardon me!â 'Tis mine impetuous spirit, that can ne'er Or stoop to bear, or pause to thinkâforgetâ Forgive my vehemence!âit springs from that Without which men are worse than savagesâ Scarce fit to herd with wolves!âthe love of country!â And I do charge theeâin the holiest name!â Though thou wilt aid notâne'er betray our cause!â Guido. I do forgive theeâhonouring more and more Thy noble nature and high-hearted zeal!â But bid thee to beware!âI fear thou stand'st O'er a dread precipice. Consider well! Danger frowns nearâI pray theeâpauseâreflect!â But this I swearâhigh Heaven record my oath! I will not slight thy chargeâthy cause betray!â But yet once more beseech thee to beware! Gia. The rubicon indeed is pastâtoo late. Farewell, thou noblest Guido!âwith all trust, Whate'er my sorrow be, I say farewell! Still know Giacinta evermore thy friend! Thy faithful and devoted friendâfarewell! (She weeps.) Guido. I am much troubled!âOh! weep not!âweep not!â Am I the unhappy cause of those wild tears?â Gia. If thou art happyâsweeter then than smiles The tears which haply thou art cause ofâleave me! (Prince Guido kisses her hand.) Guido. This be my pledge of pardon.âAh!âfarewell! [Exit Guido. Gia. The Rubicon is past!âaye! moreâthe Styx! All wears the blackest hues of Hades round! Now!ânow! ye fiends! but sway me as ye list!â I feel your promptings at mine inward soul, And hail them joyfully, and meet half way!â And said'st thou danger's near?âtrue, true it is, And haply danger too for more than one!â On every side it yawns and glooms and threats; But yet this working brain, this thrice-steeled heart Shall foil e'en fate and conquer!â'twill be so! (Rings a small bell on table. Enter Raphael.) Without the least delay send Ludovic here! Where dwells he now concealed?â Raphael. Full near at hand!â A bow-shot off!âShall I command him here? Gia. Even on the instant! [Exit Raphael. O'er my dreadless head The thick-charged thunder-clouds frown threatening now, And lightnings of fierce wrath ere long shall play, To light me to destruction's stormy joy! Oh! that Montalba had confessed!âGreat heaven! Suppose she should believe him!âAll conceal, And wrest my horrid triumph from my grasp, Since I cannot denounce him, save, indeed, I make myself the sacrifice.âWell! well! I will not think itâshe will not do thus; And when he is betrayedâaccusedâhe will notâ Noânoâhe will notâthat I firmly feel, He never will betray meâthere I am safe!â He is too generous. Enter Ludovic. Ludovic!âapproach!â Are others of thy troop now with thee here, Whom thou canst deeply trust? Ludo. Three!âlady, three!â Rocks to endureâand wild-fire to attack!â Sand to absorbâand solder to conceal!â Gia. Attend!âI need thy servicesâere long!â There are a youth and maiden here, at Rome, Whom thou with certain of thy band must seize, And with all haste and secresy, transport To thy mysterious haunts i' the Apennines.â Prince Guido Bellafiore is the youth!â The cousin of the Count Montalba's bride The maiden!âWhen once these are in thy power, Thou must compel the English maid to wed One of thy troopâthyself!âbrave Ludovic!â If so it pleaseth thee.âThe maid is fairâ Bright as the Ausonian Mayâand there detain, In strictest durance, in thy dens, the princeâ Till I shall come and claim him at thy hands. When I have fixed notâif before the day Of our great risingâhe must well believe I have by chance discovered thus the place Of his detentionâand have flown to yield His ransom, and to offer him release, If he will wed his kind delivererâstraight!â If after our grand struggle?âthen 'twere vainâ 'Twere needless to dissemble! With a crown To share with him, my way is smooth and plain!â Brave Ludovic!âdo thy part, and be the lord Of bags of burning goldâthy guerdon good. Ludo. It is not possible!âHow? seize the prince And the young maid here in the streets of Rome! It may not be!â'twere rash and mad indeed!â Remember, that the proud and palmy days Of our most brave profession are o'erpast!â That grovelling governments have dared to trench On our broad rightsâlong recognized and sacredâ That our high privileges are annulledâ Cancelled and razed our fair prerogatives. It is a burning shameâbut thus it is!â To seize upon the person now of men Of any rank thus in the public ways, Would bring destruction on our heads at once! We should be trackedâpursuedâdiscoveredâstormed In our true warrior-citadels i'the mountains, And then given over to that jadeâcalled justice!â Who opes her jagged jaws to crush our souls out. 'Tis but by sleepless vigilance and care, And keenest circumspection we contrive To clude the myrmidons of governmentâ It is not possible, I say, once more. Gia. 'Tis difficult, but hear!âMethinks I yet Can smooth the ruggedness of this emprize, And fence our undertaking fairly round With statagem of likelihood.âI know The prince hath purposed entering instantly On a clandestine marriage with this girl. There shall be trusty witnesses to swear To this, and make their friends believe they thus Have fled together with that end in view! Then we will so arrange and so dispose, That they shall track them to Livorno's port, Whence it shall be supposed they have embarked, To shun all hazards counter to their hopes:â When I repair, the ransom to propose, To your strong holds, I can ensure his silence, And fabricate some tale.â'Tis time we want!â And some quick coinage of the cunning brain. Leave that to me! thou Ludovic! the brave!â But well perform thy plain straightforward part, And seize, gag, bear them like the winds away, And plunge them in thy mountain privacies! Ludo. It bears a better colouring!âgood!âI'll do't! Gia. 'Twere best that thou wert quartered in this house, Ready to seize on ripe occasion!âstraight Prepare thyself!â Ludo. Aye! lady! doubt not me! Speak but the whisper, when the time is come. Gia. 'Tis well!âconsult with Raphael now, and Luigiâ They will bestow thee in some secret place! Fail not about thy person carefully To guard our papersâtill they be conveyed To where I have given direction and command! Ludo. Stay, lady! Should this fiery youth oppose A desperate hot resistance, shall I then Apply my little steely spell, here?âcharm (Feels in his bosom,) His heart to sleep with its sure lullaby? Gia. (starts.) The fiends!âthe fiends!â'tis theirs, not mine!âI see,â I see them grinning, gaping round me nowâ Gibbering and ghastly?âIf it is not done 'Ere the moon wanes, the bridal torch of Guido Shall sear my heart's core! Yes! most surely, yes! Ludo. And bear the corse, 'twere better, to our hold! Gia. (groaning.) Thou raven deathsman!âstint thy hideous prateâ Thy laidley loathsome croakâthe mandrake's shriek Were music to mine ears, compared with that! Depart!â Ludo. (grumblingly aside.) Nay; 'tis a delicate sense, i'faith, By'r lady!âthat can brook not thus to hear What she hath urged an agent on to do! To murder one, and give another's soul, For that same deed, to purgatorial pains, Or the everlasting excommunication, Is nothing!âNo!âbut to hear of itâmuch! [Exit Ludovic. Gia. Now must I shape, according to the events Of the next few fleet hours, my course resolved. This wild confederate, who hath lately joined us, I fear he hath brewed mischief by his mirth!â This hair-brained young De Tours!âhe must not stay Here at head-quarters. How may I devise?â Soft!âsoft!âI have it!âhe shall soon be made My secret messenger to Veniceâthere He scarce can do the harm he might do here, Mid these young, fiery, tameless spirits, all Assembled from their various states and homes In our mysterious congress!âHe must go! To-morrow's westering sun must light him hence! He is of turn too lightâof tone too looseâ Too gay of temperamentâtoo glib of tongueâ For these dark passionate sons of Italy, With their concentered sultriness of soul! Alas!âYet other things demand and claim Imperatively my fixed attention now! Oh! miserable wretch am I becomeâ Steeped in the blood of murder to the lips! Each moment wait I for a summons now From my detested victim!âshe that dares Call herself wife to him whom I once loved. 'Twas well I could controul mine anger's heat, In parleying with false Guido at the lastâ Else had he taught them haply to suspect me, And been too on his guard;âbut all is well!â Now must I go and carve out all my plans! Prepare 'gainst every exigency's turnâ Bury myself in business and in thought Most studiousâfor it thickens now!âit thrives! [Exit. Scene II. âThe Palazzo Ceria. FLORA and EVA. Flora. Sweet Eva!âthough thou thus didst save my life, Methinks I wish I ne'er had left my landâ Mine own blue Caledonia's heathery heights!â Those mountainsâqueen-like mothers of my soul! I cannot bear to watch thy sufferings! Eva. Hush! Then thou hadst ne'er met Guido! Flora. It were best!â Perchance 'twere best!âthis hushed, dark, hidden trothâ This marriage, sealed in mysteryâgrieves my soul! Eva. Nay, cheer thee!âthou wilt yet be blestâmost blest! When he shall bear thee midst the old Alpine hills! Those Mountains shall be Mothers of thy soul!â Nay, cheer thee!âcomfort thee!âah! Flora! speeds The hour too of my heavier destiny! I told thee that Montalba had at length His solemn promise given to open all His long-veiled soul to me!âThou canst not dream With what appalling awfulness of tone He gave that promise!âWhence his mania springs I cannot guess, but fear 'tis rooted deep!â At times some suffocating terror chokes My struggling heart's pulse! and I feelâI feel I scarce know what!âsome supernatural sense Of most unspoken pangs, like guiltâblack guilt! But wherefore!âam I not all innocent? Flora. Poor child!âthou'rt crush'd by conflicts longâand fears, And vigils, and sharp sufferings, and distrusts! Heaven send thee rest! Eva. Heaven send him rest!âand then Were I most happy!âHe, thou know'st, hath named The Coliseum, at the vesper's hour, For our sad trysting place!âI go alone. Flora. Art thou afraid, sweet cousin? Eva. Oh! no!âno!â Not of Montalba! never!âbut I fear To see the unshrouded phantasies that whirl In his wild brain, and make his malady. Good angels all befriend me!âthere are times When I do sink as to the dust of death!â In utter black despondence!â Flora. Yet bear up! Go through thy fearful task with firm resolve, And be thou careful not to breathe one word That he may construe into contradiction: Affect still to believe whate'er he says, Soothe him and cheerâfirst probe, then bind his wound! Eva. I will!âI will, with pitying Heaven's sweet grace! It nears the time.âOh, Flora! what's the hour? Flora. The chime told six five minutes back!â Eva. Oh! come!â Come with me, dear one! to my chamber now; Strengthen me!âpray with me!âdeal gently too With all the infirmities of my torn mind.â Bear with me, Flora!âand forgive me all!â Bear with me!âdearest!â Flora. How bear with thee?âthou Art firm, yet gentle as some suffering saint, Girt round with heaven-breathed magnanimities! Eva. I know not!âam I gentle?âam I firm? I know but that I am most wretchedâmost Insufferably miserable!â Flora. Alas!â Lean thou on me!âthou tremblestâtremblest now Like the frail aspen!âSo!âone effort more!â Thou bear'st it bravely! I will come with thee! [Exeunt. Scene III. âThe Coliseum by Moonlight. Montalba (discovered). Mont. Would she were come! a fierce impatience drives My shrieking Soul along.âI scarce can breathe Beneath this load of deadly secrecyâ That weightier seems and weightier still to grow. How have I borne it for so long? Now,ânow,â Each moment seems to add a mountain more To this o'erpowering burthen!âHush!âshe comes! Enter Eva. My gentle, loving One! thou hast well redeemed Thy solemn pledge.âStand there,âno, nearer,âTHERE!â Dost love me, Eva!âspeak!â Eva. Montalba!â Mont. Hush! Say not thou lov'st me!âbut I LOVE THEEâyes!â And I have loved thee with most fatal love. Now listenâand prepare thyself!âprepare! Oh! Eva, love me never more!âdiscard Each thought of tendernessâdestroy at once Each gentler feelingâfill thy heart with hateâ Look on me with all loathing, teach thy soul To spurn me and to curseâ Eva. Montalba! Mont. Aye! Ev'n so is called the loathliest monsterâEarth Ere yet engenderedâEva!âhist! Eva, (tremblingly.) My Lord! Mont. my Lord! soh!âwell!âthis is as it should be! No kinder word, I pray, to cut my heart Even to the core!âNow listen and be sure With all extremity of withering hate!â Disnatured, let thy lovely soul be armed To loathe and to condemn, despise, abhor,â 'Tis at thy hands I ask my punishmentâ Let every lookâso blessed once and blandâ Smite like the sword of justiceâto my soul. Let every word most poignantly express Thine utter, wild abhorrence.âYes! I ask My punishment at thy dear handsâand pray That thou wilt pour on this devoted head Those coals of fireâwhichâ Eva. Oh! my husband!âhaste!â Come back with me!âcome home!â'tis all a dream! The ruinous beauty of this awful placeâ Gleaming in ghostly moonlight startlinglyâ Troubles thy mind and wakes strange fancies there. Here Time seems changed into th'Eternity!â All things around usâstill as Night and Death Do yet appear immortal as the Soul!â Stupendous Presences come gathering round! Communing with each otherânot in words!â And to our shrinking souls oppressed and stilledâ The Majesties of Heaven and Earth appear!â Entwined with mysteries of tremendous might! My soul faints, faints away beneath its dreadâ Come hence with me, my Husband!âcome away!â The annihilating awe o'erpowereth meâ O'erpowereth thee!âthus doubly am I shaken! I cannot bear to see thee thus o'erwroughtâ Thusâthusâ Mont. Nay! hear me outâat least, at least I may claim thus much, Eva!âWife!âfrom theeâ From theeâfor whom I gaveâso madly gave That everlasting Soul I owed to God!â And grew a murdererâfor the hopeless wretch That stands before theeâis indeed condemned In sight of Heaven!âof that most heinous crime! Through my means, Bianca Bellafiore died, And I her death but compassed for thy sakeâ By poison compassed itâand slew her so! Eva. Beloved Montalba! (aside) aye! distraught! distraught! The maniac glares in every withering look!â My heart is dead! Mont. And what!âthou darestâthou darest!â Woman! I charge thee, never more on me Bestow such epithet of mockeryâno! I will not bear itâI have borne enough!â Too much have borne!âand I am crushed at last. I ask thee to abhor meâbeg thy hate, As starving men beg charity's last boon. Entreat thy sternness,âthy severityâ This cruel kindness mads my guilty soul!â With such a crime upon my spirit, still Have I dared feast on Love's deliciousnessâ (While every breath of bliss I dared to draw Still seemed a crime and fathered fresh remorse!â) Have bared my heart to blessedness of joyâ Drunk of the cup o'ermantling with delight, And culled affection's life-enchanting flowers! And yet how often from thy presence even Have I rushed forth to agonize alone, And glut the worm that revelled on my vitalsâ The never-dying worm!âOh! couldst thou knowâ (Thou never shalt!âfor thou would'st pity me)â The tortures that have ground me to the dust, The miseries that have mastered me, and martyredâ Oh!âEva! Eva!â [She goes up to him and takes his hand in both hers, and kisses it, saying, Eva. Let me but entreatâ [Mont. wildly flings her away from him. Mont. Away! away! Couldst kiss this murtherer's hand? Couldst outrage nature, justice, feeling thus? Mock Heaven, and wrong pure womanhood so much! All shame be on thee! Is't thy vanity Is pleased to think on this foul sacrificeâ This hellish deed committed for thy sakeâ This hideous proof of a most hateful love? All shame be on thee!âCouldst thouâcouldst thou kiss This reeking hand, all dripping with her blood! Her heart's-blood?âSince it ceased to flow, through me! I had looked forward to this dreadful hourâ Feeling thy horror and thy agony, Sharp as the headsman's axe had pierced me through! And proved some punishment for my dark crime! And I have yearnedâlongedâthirstedâmaddenedâpinedâ For some deep retribution of my sin, And felt thy shrinking from me would have been Almost an over-payment of despair! I have a very hungering after hell! Oh! for the dog's deathâlet me die at once! But stillâbut still!ânay!âI am not yet prepared! And, oh! my old gray father!âthat forbids. Thou dost not shrink from me. I do believe Thou dost approve the deed!âCome!âcurse me! come; Take heaven to witness that thou hat'st me now! Or, shame be on thee!â Eva. (Aside.) Hope! farewell!âfarewell! The truth that slays me stares out to my soul, And blinds and blasts itâthere's no loophole left At which the least doubt might creep inâ'tis done; His mind is all a ruin, madness holds Her empire o'er his once proud intellect.â Oh! can I see that ruin and not share it? Mont. (who has been walking about hurriedly and restlessly, suddenly stops and says,) Thinkst thou 'tis mercy that thou art showing me? I tell thee 'tis not mercy. No! no! no! Heaven! it is the direst cruelty!âStand back! Shrink from me!âfear me!âshun my basilisk look!â Mutter thine execrations in mine ear. I do desire thy loathing!âI demand Thy wild upbraiding!âclaim it as a rightâ Commandâconjure it!âspurnedâwould revel in Such agony of chastisementâwould drink Thy desperate curses to my shuddering soul, With keener thirst than ever yet I drank Thy trembling vows of love! Do thusâdo thusâ Or cursed be that false love!â (Eva faints.) Ha! what is this? Have I slain thee too? Oh! my Bride! my Bliss! My Beautiful! my gentle!âand thy fault Was but thine ever-during gentleness,â Thy nature's melting tenderness of truth!â Oh! I have shocked thee from all senseâfrom thoughtâ From lifeâthough not from love!âreturn, returnâ That I may die through joy and grief conflictingâ Thou beautiful death!âbe life and love once more! Eva (recovering). Oh! my Montalba!âleave me notâart near? Yes! yes! and thou'rt not angered now!âdear Lord, Hast thou forgiven me?âSay!â Mont. Forgiven thee? theeâ For what, poor dove? Eva. Alas!âI know not well. Mont. Come, lean on me, and I will lead thee forthâ Thy hand is ice, thy brow is ghastly!âCome, Forget awhile what thou hast heard.âOh! come, Court dear repose upon thy quiet couchâ SinceâAh! thou art changed as by an age of grief!â What world of woe hath crushed thy fragile form? Thy life seems half in the empire of cold Death! [He leads her out. Scene III. âThe Palazzo Ceria. Enter Flora. Flora. I momently expect her! hark! I heard Some creaking hingeâthe rustling of a robe. My heart beats painfully and thickâ'tis her!â Enter Eva. Almighty Heavens! how ghastly pale! Speak,âspeak! How fares it with thee? Eva. Me!âthink not of me! It is of little moment how I fare! Oh, Flora!âFlora!âsuch a hideous dream! Such a most deadly phantasy!âtoo much! It is too much!âmethinks I too go mad!â [Puts her hands before her eyes. Such gibbering spectres seem to gird me round, Mocking and mouthing at me! Flo. Tell me all! What did he thus reveal to thee? Eva. Think!âthink!â What horrors must he daily suffer!âthink What pangs must gnaw his heart's core! He conceives He murdered her,âhis lost, betrothed Bianca! Administering some deadly poison's bane To her, even on the eve of their fixed nuptials! Flora. Poor, poor Montalba!â Eva. I was shocked and grieved, But did affect to think the phantasy No fiction, but a fact.âWilt thou believe He burst into a hideous spasm of rage, That I seemed not more horror-struck at this, His dread disclosure!âTrue! I started notâ Nor turned me from himâas I should have done With almost loathingâhad I this believed! Butâwrung with pityâclasped and kissed his hand. This roused him to that ire. He raved and stormed, Wild-muttering with a maniac freezing stare, Challenging me to curse him and abhorâ Upbraiding me with kindness, worse than deathâ Down calling fate and vengeance on his headâ Himself accusing, as he loved to dwell On that fierce torture of his own dark thoughtsâ Self-execrations breathingâwild and deepâ And groaning forth the anguish of his soul, Covering himself with dire and ghastly shamesâ As recklessness of suffering brought reliefâ 'Twas horrible to see his haggard looksâ Nowânow a thousand passions fired his brow! A thousand deaths now, there despaired and darkenedâ His eye in blood-shot fury rolled around, And sent the terrors of his soul through mine!â His tones were like dread voices from the grave! The misery of his self-imposed remorse Was so o'erpoweringâand so deadly-deep, Myself felt even such sinner in its shadow!â At last, methinks, he cursed me for my love!â I heard no more, o'erworn with anguishâtorn With fierce conflicting feelings, at his feet I fell unconscious as a corse:âat length, When I recovered, on his breast I found My head was leaning; he with trembling hands Was chafing mine, and pouring fondly forth Endearing epithets.âMy tale is told! He did sustain my feeble steps, until I reached this threshold, far more dead than live!â Oh!âFlora!âis't not dark and dreadful proof Of madness this?âand proof on proof again His rage insane at my not loathing himâ Not shrinking from him. (Wrings her hands.) What! what must I do? What can I do?âwhat ought I now to do?â Enter Guido. Flo. Let us inform Prince Guido of the whole! He will advise us!â Eva. Do so thou!âdo thou, I cannot!âand be quick!âtime presses much!â For something must be done, and speedily!â [Guido and Flora walk apart conversing. Must I endure this life of racking woe? Keep calm, and act the hypocrite's cold part, Montalba!âin thy presence?âOh, belovedâ While every vein seems bursting with despair! To see thee daily dyingâthat worst death! The ruin of thy glorious intellect!â The withering of thy free and noble mind!â The grave's crust curdling o'er thy warm affectionsâ All thy bright eagle facultiesârare feelingsâ Monstered by one most horrid mania's strife!â Better to watch thee daily draw the breath, The suffocating, shivering, scarce-heaved breath That wants but little to the lastâto watch Those fierce convulsions of the expiring frameâ What be they to the soul's long agonies?â The mind's unutterably deadlier throes!â What kills that frame to sufferâto the soul Gives but redoubled life!âit grows on anguish! [Guido and Flora come forward. Guido. Dear countess!âhear me! I should counsel thee, And without further loss of time to send For aid professionalâit must be so!â Poor, lost Montalba!âWhat a monstrous dream!â How doth it stamp his dire insanity!â Giacinta wouldâ Eva. I have just sent for her! I wrote, imploring her to come at onceâ And made the bearer safe of the ill-starred scroll My own most faithful Anthony, who best On such a heavy errand I could trust. Guido. I am right glad that thou hast sent to her:â She is most prompt to counsel and devise;â And whatsoe'er her faults, I feel she is A true and zealous friend.âDidst thou detail The frightful circumstances of the case Is this thy missive?â Eva. Yes! in brief I did!â I felt to write it easier than to speak. Guido. She will be here anon, then?â Eva. Every sound I think 'tis her!âOh! woe! woe! woe! my heart Can feel no hope, can dream no changeâ'tis done!â Montalba is a maniac!âWhat am I?â A widow, though a wife for evermore! My hopes, my heart, my energies, my thoughts, My feelings withering in my husband'sâcell!â Worse, oh! ten thousand times than e'en his grave! For that I feel we should together share!â Enter Giacinta, who goes up to Eva, and affectionately embraces her. Gia. My gentle sufferer!âmost unhappy friend!â Alas!âthy heavy tidings!âmust it be?â Eva. Oh! counsel me Giacinta! give me aid. Is there a shadow of one hope yet left? Gia. Yes!âcheer thee up!âI long revolved and weighed Thy letter's dire contentsâat length a light Gleamed through my troubled senses.âI do see But one expedientâthat were safe and wise!â Guido! thou know'st thy father's friendâthine own, And also poor Montalba's from his childhoodâ The celebrated Medico of Florence!â Guido. Thy good Dottore Reggio? Gia. Right! the same!â Guido. He was called in when my poor sister first Showed symptoms of her mortal malady. Gia. Therefore the best for us to call in now! For every reasonâhe would know at once, Should poor Montalba wildly rave to him, As he attended sweet Bianca's death-bed, The tale a fabrication of the brain, Diseasedâdistempered:âthen, as the loved friend Of Count Montalba, we are safely sure He never will betray his mournful case, (Since I do hope it may be still concealed!) But keep that secret close as would the grave.â Reggio is most renowned for zeal and skill. He will do allâthat can be doneârest sure!â And knowing from his earliest childhood thus Our suffering friend, must knowâa weighty pointâ His constitution thoroughly and well. I still believe 'tis but some passing heat Of wild deliriumâfrom unsettled health And a too vivid, warm imagination!â If soâand our good Florentine achieves The cure we hope forâall will be hushed up;â I would not have it noised about for worlds: On his recovery 'twould much chafe and grieve Our noble patient.âThis my counsel is, Most secretly and speedily to send This night to Florence some trustworthy man To urge the immediate presence of the leech. Guido. To thy sage counsel I do much incline;â It is the wisest course that we could take! 'Twill prove, I hope, with theeâno stubborn caseâ Some temporary, slight derangement!â Gia. Well! If thou, dear Eva, dost agree in this, 'Twere best the messenger were straight despatched, Ere the night wears.âI would enjoin ye all To keep the strictest secresy on this! And all that bears upon this subject now! Tell not Montalba's much-loved Della Moria. He might not view the affair in the same light That we all view it,âand there is no end To wonderingsâhintsâconjecturingsâand reports. Guido. Thou'rt right!âShall I at once indite and send The letter to the Doctor Riggio?âwith Our joint entreaties, he will lose no time In being on the road to Rome!âwilt give, Dear countess, thy consent to thisâat once. Eva. Methinks it seems the sole best methodâyes!â [Guido sits down and writes. Guido. (to Eva.) Wilt thou permit me to give orders now?â Eva. Oh, yes! my brain whirls round, (she sits down.) What is't?âYes!âyes!â Give thou the orders.âI am sick at heart!â Guido. What, ho! within there! Enter Giachimo. Hasteâat once and find Some trusty messenger to send to-night To Florence,âbearer of this precious scroll; First let him wait on us for orders straight! Giach. I will obey your highness's commands!â [Exit Giachimo. Gia. 'Twere best, methinks, that I should now retire, Since, should Montalba chance to pass this wayâ He might suspect our conference did regard In some sort his late parleying with his wife. Eva. It might be thus!âAh! better thou shouldst go!â He is suspiciousâsuddenâat all timesâ But trebly so of late!âAll thanks to thee, Angel of consolations and best kindness!â Counsellor and comforter!âgood night!âgood night! Gia. Acquaint me in the morning, I entreatâ Sweet Flora! how this dreadful night hath past With the poor outworn countess! Flora. Certainly. Gia. (aside.) Oh!âmy heart leaps with hatred at thy sightâ My very soul turns white with jealousy;â But thou shalt suffer!âthou shalt yet succumb, And mine shall be the banquet of revengeâ The luxury of victorious hatred then!â [Exit Giacinta. Guido. The messenger is tardy!âIt should scarce Be far advanced in night ere he sets out. Flora. Would he were come: he tarries tediously! Enter Giachimo. Giach. The courier waits for orders on the outside. Guido. Admit him instantly. [Exit Giach. The scroll!âthe scroll!â Flora, (takes it from the table, and gives it to Guido.) Here!âfoldedâsealedâaddressedâ Guido. Best thanks! beloved! Enter Messenger. Guido. Art thou well horsed?â Mess. So please your highnessâyes!â Guido. Canst ride like lightning? Mess. For a thundering bribe! Guido. That thou shalt have, if thou fulfil thy part!â (Thou must absolve thy duty firstâobserve!) To our full satisfaction!âthese convey, And with thine own hands speedily deposit I' the hands of him to whom the document Is superscribed;âwith thine own hands, I say,â And charge thee, on thy peril, to commit Or botch or negligence, nor dare return With plausible excuse for foul default. Mess. I will do all I am directed.âKnow A fleeter, steadier messenger ne'er made The road ring out beneath his flying steed!â Give me the scroll, my lord! Guido. Here!âput it up, And swift to horse!âto horse!âand draw not rein, Save to change coursers, till thou gain'st thy goal. Swiftâin the saddle!âstart!âmake furious haste! Hasteâhasteâfor life and death!âmountâspeedâpost-haste. [Exit Messenger. Guido. Now I entreat ye both to seek repose. The best we could devise hath now been done. Fair countess! I beseech thee lean on me. [Exeunt all. END OF ACT IV.</field>

List, Anthonyâa lady proud and fair, The Countess di Castellanaria sends To ask news of your health, since she hath heard This air of Rome doth disagree with you. Fain would she these three golden pills prescribe, Trusting they may most beneficial prove. (Offers him gold.) Antho. I'll roll thee quickly to one pill of paste, And swallow thee, just silvered o'er with salt, Thou Flibbertigibbert of a flying fish! There's for your Countess Cast-steelâmore like brass, tho',â A fillip and a fig for her and you. (Chucks the money violently out of his hand.) [Giachimo angrily puts his hand to his bosom. Wouldst draw thy needle from its housewife case, And run me throughâthe tip o' the little finger! I'll drown thee then incontinentlyâyea, I'll drown thee inâthe drop of blood that's spilt! Or grind thee into powder's airiest snuff, And take thee 'twixt my thumb and fingerâthus, Without remorse, at one small pinchâof page! Why dost thou stick for ever to my skirts? Thou burâthou barnacleâI'll shake thee off, Though like a very minister of state, Fastening to peck and perch, though stuck'st to me, I will not be thy buttâthou barleycorn! Out on thee, squeaking penny-trumpet!âout! Thou spratâthou spotâthou dot!âthou vile grimace! Thou hornet-hobbledehoyâthou buzzing booby!â Think'st thou thy countess shall corrupt me?âNo! Fly offâevaporateâhenceâretreatâdisperse! Thou vast assemblage of absurditiesâ Most riotous concourse of nonentities!â Vanish!âavaunt!âI tell thee!âtruce to all Thy brazed audacities, or else, indeed, I'll tickle thee o'the wrong side of thy heart, And turn thee inside out. Giach. Old thunderer!âcome, If thou must grumble, growl in strain more civil. Antho. Not I!âmy queer young quack, with your prescriptions; Comeâpick your poisonous pills up; on my soul, I've nine good minds to ram them down your throat, And try the power of your digestion thus! There, pick them upâand take them back to her, Your charming Countess Castle-in-the-air-there! Take them to her, you carrier pigeonâyou Distributor of cards!âyou poodle-comber!â Or I will comb and card and pluck you soon! Oh! that I were once more in mine own land! Sick, sick am I of this outlandish desert! By this time I should have forsworn my state Of single blessednessâsome goodly wife And family around!âall jolly dogs!â Enter Francisca. Fran. Why, how now, Anthony?âwhat ails thee, pray? I ne'er yet heard thee speak in such grave toneâ What say'st thou of a wife and family?â Antho. That I do wish I dwelt among them now!â Fran. I knew not thou wert married!â Antho. No! nor I! But I may wish I was!â Fran. (laughs.) Ohâsurely yes! But, if a ready-made young family You'd like to haveâadopt some hundreds here, Of houseless starvelingsâ'twere a worthy deed. Antho. I thank thee kindlyâI'm unworthy of it.â Fran. And as for wife! why, our majestic Romeâ The widow of a worldâfor such she isâ Count her your stately, glorious, beauteous spouse. Antho. I'm no uxorious husband, then, I swear. I wish she'd sue for separate maintenance!â A widow, quotha!âfaithâa jolly oneâ But rather far advanced, methinks, in years. Fran. Now, Anthony!âyou always chatter so, You will not let me tell my lady's message. Antho. Come, that's a good one: you've been rattling onâ Fran. 'Tis quite impossible one little word To squeeze in edgewaysâsuch a tongue you have,â Clackâclackâall day and night, the whole house rings With your incessant gabbling.âIt is strange The men can neverânever hold their tongues.

And stayâmarkâAnthony!â Antho. Mark Anthony! Why, that's some old, great Roman's Latin name, One of their ancient coves and codgers, sure!â I'm grown so learnedâan antiquarian quite! What is't?âmy pretty Cleopatra, eh!â (Who was Mark Anthony?âher love I knowâ And rather think, from what I can collect, He was some famous fox-hunter of old.)â Fran. (tossing her head.) Your Cleopatra!âSay not that again. Marry come up!âa likely story that. In the first place, good man, what made me yours! And am I like that Amazonian mummy?â That great gigantic thing, whose needle looks For all the world, like some huge pillar-post! Antho. I cry you mercy!âI had understood She was a pretty gypseyâlike yourself! Giach. The proud triumvir lacked another world To lose for thee, sweet Fancy! Antho. Try 'em, how much?â Fran. Well, Anthony, when you can pause, awhile, Just to take breath, you everlasting jabberer, Allow me to inform you furtherâthus The countess doth desire, that when arrives A friend from Florence, whom she now expects, You should immediately acquaint herself, And not my lord the countâthat he is here. Antho. I will forthwithâand rather had, by far. My lord the count is grown so fierce and strange I nothing like so little as to meet him: 'Twas but the other day he called for me, And bade me bring a glass of water:âwell, He said 'twas bad; on which I just remarked It possibly was poisoned!âsince such things, I had been told, were common here in Rome!â He started up, and thundered at me so, To get me gone!âI staid for no more ordersâ But tumbled over head and heels down hereâ Curled up into a most compact close ball!â As you might do (to Giach.) my ourang-outang-hedgehog! I think my lady will repent, ere long;â I wish, with all my heart, we ne'er had metâ Nor married these Italians,âthat I do!â Giach. I must begoneâaffairs important call! The Countess di Castellanaria beggedâ Antho. What!âgoing to that lofty lady's houseâ Your Countess Cast-her-on-the-harriers-there? Fran. What is thy business there?âacquaint us, pray! Giach. You know she hath the fairest, choicest flowers That may be found at Rome in her vast gardens; And she still tells me, in her gracious way, To come and gather nosegays for my ladyâ And the Signora Flora:â'tis most kind! Antho. For my partâI do think that I have seen Your Countess Cast-her-well-in-the-area, cast Some sheep's-eye stolen glances at our princeâ The noble Guido.âHow is that, my mop-stick? Giach. And I well think the lady may perchance Be deep in love, for I too oft have seenâ Fran. (eagerly,) What!âGiachimo?â Antho. What?âJackanapes!âout with it! Giach. The countess looking most incessantlyâ Intensely too, and with an anxious mienâ Sure proof she is outrageously in loveâ Atâher fair selfâreflected in the glass!â Antho. How!âNoodle!âart thou making game of us?â I'll tread thee out now like a twinkling spark! I'll trample on thee for a long lank weed! Giach. I am most serious!âAsk Francesca now If 'tis not true, that when a lady falls In love, she doubly falls in vanity!â For every feeling that she gives to him, Her worshipped one! she keeps ten for herself, And likes him in proportion as he yields A woman's wealthâlarge crops of admiration! Enter Antonio. Anto. Francesca! is my lady's health improved? Antho. My lady!âWhy! I thought it was my Lord Was suffering with the queerums!âhow is this? Fran. Nay! both indeed are slightly indisposed. My lady hath a sharp attack of nerves; A terrible maladyâI know it well! (affectedly,)I suffer tortures often from this causeâ And grow hysterically sensitive.â Anto. (aside.) I like it not!âI cannot comprehend What may have passed of lateâbut something hath. Have dark suspicions haply got abroad?â I have but one thing still to do;âbut one, And that is, to be silentâclose as death! Fran. Well! Anthony!âI must not stay indeed!â You have detained me here so very long To listen to your never-ceasing prateâ You most incorrigible babbler!ânow, You know, I've said a thousand times, I must, I must indeed not stay on idling hereâ Attending to your garrulous gossip!ânow Release me, doâI must not stay, indeedâ So felicissima notte!âAnthony. [Exit Francisca. Antho. Feller-cheese-is-more-knotty!âstuff and porridge! It seems indeed a mighty knotty point!â Dost feller me? it sounds unseemly, quite Improper to a person of my station! Come, my good Tony O!ânow I really mustâ (I can no longer bear this ignorance)â Entreat of you to let me know my rank? Anto. Your rank? What mean ye? Antho. Why! I know I am A majorâmajor duomo! but I lack This knowledge which I therefore seek from thee:â Say in what regimentâabroad or hereâ Do I my new commission holdâand if 'Tis in the cavalry or infantry? Giach. Oh! capital! delightful! ha! ha! ha! Anto. Ha! ha! a wondrous puzzling question 'tis. Oh! in the cavalry, be very sure; You'll have to mount your charger now ere long; A stout one I should hope, for both your sakes. Antho. I am rejoiced 'tis in the cavalry!â I like not walking much, especially In this hot soddening climeâa horseback now I shall feel active, airy, light, and pleasant! I'll mount the breach! Giach. Beware! thou'lt break it down!â Antho. Your soldier is your true chameleon, he Lives on the breath of glory and its smoke,â A very palatable foodâno doubt;â Though sometimes hurtful to the constitution! He wears her colours allânow pale to death His heart's core rasped and riddled through with shot, And now flushed deep with gory crimsoned stains, Or blue with honourable scars, or swarthed And smutchy with the dim dusk sulphurous clouds Of fiery war!âShall I be such chameleon?â Giach. A very corpulent chameleon, troth!â You thrive on air!â Antho. And you on airs!âyou ape!â You're a nice articleâyou are:âbegone To your dear Countess Castor-oil-and-hartshorn-her! Giach. Good John roast Bull! I will evaporate thus!â Exit Giachimo. Anto. And I must leave you Anthony as well; I have commissions to fulfil to-dayâ For my good Lord:âI haste to seek the priestâ His worthy grave confessorâkind Anselmo. Antho. And I may go and take my little nap:â This clime is only fit for sloths, methinks, Since 'tis impossible to do aught else Than help each other to doânothing here! [Exeunt. Scene II. âAn Apartment in Count Montalba's Palace. Enter the Marchese Della Moria. Della Moria. Methought that I should here Prince Guido meet: I have strange tidings for his private ear: But the whole palace seems deserted quite! No stir of stepsânor voices:âit is strange! Strange too the change in poor Montalba's mien And manner:âhaggard-wild his countenance,â His eye is hollow,âashy is his cheek,â Save where at times a burning fever-spot Proclaims that all is warâwild war within!â I understand it notâ'tis mystery all!â And with so lovely, so unmatched a bride, Ne'erâne'er yet saw these eyes a living form, Or an ideal one of such heavenly beauty!â Happy Montalba!âfor he ought to be The happiest of the blest! If I had drawn So bright a lot, I were indeed so;âyes,â Were I the husband of that peerless one I should be moreâpshaw!âfolly!âit is vain, To think of brightâimpossibilities!â That gentle, shrinking Evaâwith a voice So silvery in its softness, that it seems Heard only by the charmed sense of the heart!â Soh! here is Guido! Enter Guido. Prince!âa word with thee! And instant!âit concerns thy safety much. Guido. And how? Moria. As I was passing yestereve, Through a bye-street aloneâI marked two men Leaning beside an antique fountainâcloaked Up to their chins, and wearing masks besides, Engaged in earnest conversation close.â They heard me not.âI caught thy whispered name, And listened breathlessly!âthough what I heard, Was heard by broken snatches, leaving much That had elucidated more their parley, It was enough to wake alarm for thee!â Thus ran what I could glean of their discourse:â âThe young Prince Bellafiore!âis't to night?â This asked the one, the other answered him, âNo not to-night!âââTo-morrow then, I trust,â Rejoined the former speakerââMay be so!â Was the replyâthen lower sank their tonesâ Till presently some slight dispute arose, And then they raised their voices:âone exclaimed, âThou hadst the moiety of the booty, then!â The captain shared it with thee!âand thou knowst Our last rich English family, 'twas thou That hadst the sacking of their luggage all!â 'Tis now my turn, and I will claim my right:â Whate'er about his person we may find, When he is seized; 'tis mine by all our rules, And by all laws of justiceâand of honour!â Then entered they into a long disputeâ Abuseârecriminationsâthreateningsâoathsâ Were wanting not; but I had heard enough, And happily succeeded to elude Their scrutiny, and wended on my way, Resolved to seek thee in the morning; since 'Twas plain, that night at least, that all was safe!â I counsel thee, prince!âfor some time to come, To move about most cautiously and armed!â There must be some dark plot against thee hatched! Some villany afoot!âLook to it well!â Guido. I thank thee for thy tidings and thy hints: I will not go abroad without my arms!â It is most strange! Moria. Reports of thy vast wealth Have doubtless fired the rogues' cupidity; But they are baffledâsince thou'rt now prepared!â Yet I would urge thee on thy guard to be: There are some desperate wretches, who would pauseâ Would stint at nothing, now abroadâ'tis said, Driven from the adjacent countryâtheir old hauntsâ By rigorous measures, routedâcheckedâdispersedâ Till found they refuge in the streets of Rome! These in the city act their lawless deedsâ Even at our thresholds dare their ravages! And there commit their depredations, yet All undiscovered, on the citizens!â This I believed not, I confess, till now; But it should seem it hath some touch of truth. Enter Eva. Eva. Guido, hast heard aught yet from Florenceâsay? Forgive me, noble marquisâI marked not That you were by!âHast seen my lord to-day? Moria. Madam, not yet, I am but lately here. Eva. Methinks 'twere best you should not see him, then; He hath been indisposed most grievously, And passed a restless night. I urged repose: He now lies stretched upon the couch within. Moria. 'Twere better he should know not I am here. (Aside,)Heavens! what a most angelic aspect 'tis!â New beauty seems to pass into her face Each time the eyes do steal a look at her!â Farewell! in the evening I will come again And learn fresh tidings of thy husband's health. [Exit Della Moria. Eva. Did I not well, dear Guido?âit were best It should be known and thought he is unwell; Lest, were he all too suddenly removed From his own friends, and from societyâ Suspicions, gathering soon, may be afloat; And thenâbesides he is unwell indeed! His hands burn fearfullyâhis temples throb!â Guido. Sweet lady! you have done all for the best And bear up wondrouslyâbut I could wish Thou wouldst not wear thyself with watching thus; Nought can be done till worthy Reggio comes. Eva. Ah! but each moment I expect him now. My pulses toll as 'twere a funeral knell, Yet far outrun the lazy, laggard chimeâ Did I but count by them he should be here!â Alas!âmy speech, I doubt, fantastic grows; From the complexion of his own, it takes Its troubled colourings!âWilt thou meet, my prince, When first he comes, the good physician here?â Didst thou inform him, in those hasty lines, Of our most heavy fearsâof all the dreadâ Theâtheâ Guido. The mournful features of this caseâ I gave a rapid outlineâbut will more Explainâexpose, if thou shouldst deem it bestâ I nothing said of that dark haunting thought, That phantasy which makes his heart its prey. Eva. Oh! caution him to shroud, with watchful care The dreadful truth, from my beloved lord. We must assure Montalba he is come By chance to Rome;âthen let thy friend affect, But from his looks, his illness to infer; To judge from outward signs of the inward strife. Guido. This shall be done!â Enter Flora. My heart's bright sunbeam, haste And shine away the shadows of our gloom. Flora. Ah! no!âtoo much I share itânot yet come? Guido. Not yetâbut fear not, he will soon be here. Flora! thou'rt pale and weary!â Flora. Tush!âI charge thee Think not on me! look not on me! 'tis nought! Think of her sufferings! look at her changed form! My sorrow is but sympathy with hers! Enter Servant. Serv. The Countess di Castellanaria waits. Eva. Without delay admit her. [Exit Servant. 'Tis most kind The tender interest that she takes in all That thus concerns us!âshe is kind indeedâ And most affectionately grateful I!â Enter Giacinta. Gia. I am much grieved to hear this sharp suspense Is still continuedâthat he is not come, Our worthy Reggio!âIt perhaps is well, Since those who suffer in the dreadful way That poor Montalba doth, are shrewdly quick For ever to suspectâand to misdoubt. Had his appearance followed quickly thusâ Hark there! I heard methinks a noise of wheels, A tramp of horsesâ'tis most surely him! Look to the countess!âOh! she faints! she falls! (They lead her to a seat, she starts up.) Eva. No! I must fail not!âto Montalba straight Must I repairâpreparing him to meet His ancient friend!âand ye, Giacinta, Flora, Hasten within!â'twere best that Guido should First meet himâyetâhow spins my tortured brain. [Exeunt Giacinta and Flora. Guido!âthou must come with me to my Lord, Better wilt thou command thyself, and tell The tidings of this new arrival too, Than I can doâa tremour in my tone, A change upon my cheek, and he might 'gin To glean suspicions from my treacherous weakness, Then canst thou here return to greet thy friend! Guido. With all thy wishes let me but comply!â [Exeunt. (As they are going the Doctor enters at opposite side, conducted by Anthony.) Antho. I will inform the gracious countess, sir,â This way, I prayâthat you now wait her pleasure. [Exit Anthony. Reggio. And shall I meet indeed young Guido here? I have but rarely seen him since that nightâ That night of doom and death!âand dread and doubt!â How I once loved him!âfrom his boyhood he Was ever my delight!âa blessed child!â And he was like a last-born babe to me! His health being something delicate, requiring Incessant watchfulness.âI daily saw himâ How he would fly, dear cherub, to mine arms! And call me still his second fatherâso! And I now shrink from him with loathing e'en!â The hideousness of that most horrid doubt, So nigh to certainty, doth frown between And part us, and for ever!âyet so weak, So very weak my melting heart was still, I could not bear to breathe the scantiest hintâ The slightest murmur of my deadly knowledge! Poor victim!âpoor Bianca!âthou sleep'st well; But had I breathed the history of thy deathâ How would thy princely fatherâhow would all, To thee by ties of blood and nature bound, Have bowed beneath the crushing weight of woe, That scarce can find a consolation hereâ The knowledge that one loved one died a victim!â Another loved one livesâthe criminal!â Guido!âI hear that thou'rt approved of allâ High-hearted, noble, brave, free, frank, and proud, Munificent and generous!âit may be! But thou'rt a demon yet, if thou indeed Art thy poor sister's black-soul'd murderer! And this by startling facts I am assured! Most certainly by poison 'twas she died! Staggered by symptoms unaccountable, I prayed the father's leave to ascertain The immediate causes of her death deplored; Urging my mind's sole satisfaction's plea, As to what source that fatal illness owned, Not hinting in the least I did suspect She had been foully dealt with:âhe agreed, And placed beyond a doubtâwas this dark factâ She died by poison!âthen whose murderous hand Administered the death draught?âwas the question:â One and one only by her death could gain!â That one wasâwho?âher brother!âhe sole heir To almost regal wealth, at once became To state, place, power, and honours high and proud, Heâonly gained by her untimely fall; And Guilt and Guido seem too surelyâone! I feel 'tis so!âyet weak as childhood's self My heart leans still too much to mercy's side! How could I bear my boy!âmy child!âmy flower! My darling and my nurseling of old years, Should perish, and through my means on the scaffold, Convicted too of so abhorred a crime?â Oh! saints defend me!âit is he himself! Enter Guido, who extends his hand to Reggio. Guido. My best old friend! what! not a hand to give To your spoilt Guido?ânay! 'twere most unkind! Come, (embraces him,) I would chide thee soundly, had I time, But we are met on grievous business here. My brief communication, half expressed The deep affliction under which our friend, The Count Montalba, is sore labouring now. The countess will herself detail to you The painful and precise particulars. Thus much she hath commissioned me to say, First, that on no account you must disclose To her afflicted lord the reason why You bide at Rome; and secondly, she begs That you will pledge yourself most solemnly That no coercion, save where strictly needful, Shall be attempted in this mournful case: And yet another thing she doth entreat, You will not hint at separating her From her own rightful postâher husband's side! Poor lady!âyou must pity her sad state, And show her all indulgence, kindness, aid, And feeling's sympathy!âShe suffers much.â Reg. I am the more induced to do so, since I love her lord, and ever honoured him! Guido. (aside,) His manner is much changed to meâso chilled! So grave and distant!âbut it hath been thus When we have metâwhich hath but seldom chanced, E'er since my dearest sister's death;âas though He thought my inward feelings must be changed, Because my prospects and position are. (To Reggio,)I need not recommend you to employ Your deepest skill, for our dear patient's sake! Nor warn you not to whisper one faint hint Of his unhappiest, awful malady. Reg. Assuredly you need not!âall my heart Is listed on the hapless sufferer's side!â Guido. Now will I seek the sorrowing countessâstraight, And lead her to this chamber. Reg. It is well! [Exit Guido. The same frank, open, fearless air and tone, The aspect and the accost, and all the same: He must be hardened past redemption, sureâ If he hath such a sin upon his soul, And yet above it SUCH a face can wear; 'Tis inconceivable and terrible! If he hath such a sin?âIt must be so! Were there not other circumstances joined, In dark array, to point him out the man? Did not the Countess di Castellanaria Observe to me how evermore he watched To give his sister each cool chrystal draughtâ As though through brotherly affection's zeal, (The countess, this conceiving as the cause?) Not this aloneâa thousand things appeared To witness 'gainst him with the trumpet's tone!â Yes!âGuilt!âblack Guilt and Guido must be one! Montalba!âpoor Montalba!âthy sad state Scarce claims my thoughts, so much on him they brood, The assassin of his sisterâand thy bride! Enter Countess and Guido. Guido. The kind physician, who hath hastened here, Obedient to your wishes and commands, With sympathizing mournfulness awaits Your orders, lady, and your will attends! Eva. I am most grateful to thy friend, that thus He hath precipitated here his steps: Beseech thee, Sir, one moment to attend While I dispose of matters with the Prince. Guido!âour kind Giacinta, knowing well It is my earnest wish that Flora hence Should be removed, while these most painful scenes (Which I far better shall support alone) Take place within the palace, hath proposed That thou shalt her accompany ere longâ Escorting to Giacinta's home, where both May well remain, till what time I shall send To seek you there, when all is o'er, and tranquil, And pray you to return to this abode! Do not, I beg, dispute this point with meâ I am most fixed, most firm in this resolve. Dear Flora still is slightly delicateâ Too sensitive to brave such fearful scenes.â 'Twere vain to strive to shake meâthis besides, I wish all hushed and silenced.â Guido. Yet, but think, How wilt thou need affection's kind support, And friendship's services, and prompt devotionâ At this sad crisis!âOh! vouchsafe to hear! Beseech thee be advised!âthou art too rash To enter thus on such a trial sore, Alone! Eva. My heart must be so ever, since Noneânone can share its loss, or match its love: The immeasurable misery that o'erpowers My soul in its abandoned singlenessâ Must make me henceforth evermore alone, In one unbroken solitude of soul!â No more! my prince, I am determined thus! And without witnesses, save one, whose help Can sole to him avail, thus sole to me,â Thy worthy friendâwill act my fearful part. Guido. Since it is thus 'twere vain to urge thee moreâ It seems like cold desertionâharsh neglect! But thou knows't 'tis not so!âand must I yield? Eva. Thou must!âkind Guido!âand full soon, I pray, Conduct my gentle Flora from this house. Guido. I must obey thee, though I fear herself Will much opposeâand much resist this plan. Eva. Convey my earnest wishes to her now! [Exit Guido. I do delay like one about to embark On a tempestuous sea of billowy strifeâ And yet pause timidly upon the shore Of mine engulphing enterprise of grief!â I pray thee, sir! be seated. (They sit down.) Thou'rt aware Of our most dire suspicions!â Reg. Madam!âyes!â I fear it must be a soul-harrowing task For thee to enlarge on all the symptoms shown Of late by thy unhappy consort; yet None could so well, I doubt, fulfil that task! Eva. I shrink not from itâor if I do shrink, The sense of this mere selfishness of suffering Will but the more uprouse me to o'ercome That woman-weakness!â Reg. Have these symtoms been More frequent lately and more marked and strong? Eva. They have long gradually been deepening on, Even without intermission have increased, At times his strong, insidious malady Hath made precipitated progressâthen Less suddenly pressed foward, might appear Brought haply to a slight but treacherous pause; Yet 'twas not so!âor if it wasâ'twas but A breathing moment, which appeared, alas! To lend but new strength to the following phrenzy. Reg. Hath he displayed dislike unto thyself? Impatience at thy kindnessesâdisgust At thy once much-loved presence? Eva. Oh! no! no! Stay! in one instanceâthat I will relate I' the course of our sad communingâoh! no!â He ne'er hath showed dislike nor change towards me, Save in the impatient sallies of the soulâ Which like chance-scattered arrows, here and there Flew far and wideânone aimed atâstriking all!â Reg. I understood thou hadst had to bear with much. Eva. Endurance hath made up my life of late! But not from his unkindnessâhe hath ne'er Been grievously unkind to me!âthough oft I' the hurry and the wildness of his soul, The impetuosities and heat of thought, He hath said things that have much racked my heart. No matter!âthey ne'er rankled there, at least!â Reg. (aside.) The wounded dove thinks not of her own hurt, Made strong through the unabated tenderness,â Through the unextinguishably exquisite And passionate affections that controul!â Though 'twere immedicably deepâthat woundâ She feels the blood that quickens round her heartâ Not that which gushes from it!â(to Eva,) hath he seemed To bear himself of late, despite all this,â Still with his wonted health? Eva. Except the flush Of feverâand the outwearying restlessness, Which chases slumber from his throbbing temples; Except for thisâand yet his aspect shows As there were corporal suffering too, so changed, The last few days, especially, I fear!â He hath become attenuatedâpallidâ And changed in features as in countenance. Reg. Doth some prevailing phantasy appear To be as the orbed moon of his mind's strong tides?â Some one particular, especial theme Goad him to fury on the slightest hint, And draw forth all his latent heat of mind? Eva. Yes, a most fearful and distracting dream!â A most intolerable imagining! (Aside.Why is't with a peculiar weight of woe I do approach this portion of my tale? Ah! 'tis because it stamps the fatal truth Beyond my skill to doubt!âfor I have sought, With patience and with skill, to carve and shape Some probability of sweet escape From these o'erpowering horrors.)âYes! he doth Nurse a most dark delusion in his mind, Which I will tell to thee anon; but first I pray thee to assure me solemnly, Distinctly, and with full, unwavering faith, That whatsoe'er the upshot yet may be Of his dread phrenzy, thou wilt never seek To part me from my special placeâhis side! There is my world!âthough true that world's eclipsed, Its darkest dust is worth the stars to me!â There is my life!âthough it be wrung with anguish;â To breathe another air were not to be!â Existence else were universal death! Give me that pledge, that promiseâI will be Whate'er thou bid'st me in his presence still!â Talk him to restâor stay there, taciturn As the cold grave:âthat were a princely house, Compared with what the maniac's cell must be! Oh! heaven!âOh! heaven!âand can I speak that word? And can I think that thing and breathe and live?â Give me the promise!âmould me as thou wiltâ I will but look and move as thou advisest. I will e'en strive to feelâto rule my soul And rushing heartâas thou dost counsel me!â Despoil mine eye of all its tenderness, If it should better suit to seem more stern!â Deny me not!âI will not let thee speak, Because I see what thy dark speech would be, I interdict thine interdiction thus!â I will not leave himâwhile I yet may live. In fine, I tell thee that we must not part! Refuse me not!âit were indeed in vain! Reg. Ev'n if thy lord's recovery should depend On such a separation for awhile?â Eta. Thou staggerest meâfor that most wished-for end What would I not confrontâwhat not endure Of agonyâof torture?âand believe To leave him were to drain the deepest lees, To plunge in the profoundest depths of both.â Must I, indeed, then leave him?âlose myselfâ That I but know through thoughts of love for himâ And duteous waiting on his every wish!â Oh! worst, unprecedented doom of ruin!â Say! must this be?â Reg. Nay! lady! I trust not!â But cannot yield a positive reply Till I have seen thy husband.âPray unfold What is this haunting phantasm of his thought, Whose governing influence rules his transport's tide. Eva. A wild and phrenzied and most dire conception He doth believeâmy poor Montalba dothâ That heâthou knew'st the fair young maid, methinks, The youthful Princess Bianca Bellafiore?â Reg. Ev'n from her earliest youthâto her last hour! Eva. And know'st she was betrothed to my dear lord, And died ev'n while the marriage crowns were wreathing. Reg. None know as well as I do, all that hangs To the most heavy history of her death!â Eva. My husband, with distempered rage insane, Heâthat would harm notâthe least living thing!â Swore, with deep, solemn oaths, to me, of late, And doubtless doth believe with his whole soul, He murderedâpoisoned her, his promised bride! Reg. (Starting from his seat.) Ha!âye!âAlmighty heavens! hear that!âIs't so?â Eva. (rising,) Alas! my heart diesâdiesâwithinâme now. Dost think from this his fierce disorder proved Incurable?âBut spare me! mercy! say but no! Ah! mercy!âmercy! dos't thou all despair? Lives there no hope?âno remedy?âno aid?â Tell meâat once!âand kill me:âoh! but speak! (Sinks down on her chair.) Reg. (agitatedly,) Sweet lady!âpeace!âI know not!âoh! be still!â (My own brave Guido!)ânayâI nothing knowâ I fear there are strange things!â(my high-souled boy!â) Poor lady!â(he is innocent!) Eva. Great Heaven! Thou wilt not answer me!âIs there yet hope? Break me not thus on doubt's revolving wheel!â Now hopeânow fearânow firmnessânow distrust!â Reg. Oh! lady!âask me not!â(thou injured virtue!â My guiltless, guiltless one!)âI must not stay. 'Tis most imperative, (aside.)âI must absolve This dreadful duty!âNot a momentâno! I must not lose one moment, lest my soul, Once more unsteeled, should into ruth relapse. I dare not hesitateâaway!â Eva. And what!â How says't thou?âwouldst thou see him now at once? Let me conduct thee then, (rising from her seat.) Reg. Not soânot so! Methinks 'twere more advisable to waitâ On further thoughts, methinks it were more meet! This sudden and precipitated journeyâ Its hurry and disorderâmake me most Unfit to see my noble patient yetâ (Heavens! mine own Guido! cleared,âclearedâspotless! stainless!)â Dear lady! I will wait on thee ere longâ IâIâin truth I will return full soon. (My gallant boy!âbut thou, Montabla!âthou!â) [Exit Reggio. Eva. Small consolation doth he give me thus! Where, where must I now bend my tearful gaze? Oh! where must I for touch of comfort look? He seems perplexed by all I have described, And no opinion will pronounce.âAh! meâ What noise was that?âI shake at every sound. Some grisly, supernatural terror seems To paralyze my sensesâI must haste To my most mournful postâmust seek my lord, And like a trembling sentinel, remain A heavy watch to keep o'er his chance words And looks and movements, and to ward off all That might, perchance, jar harshly on his soul, Already from its own fair course so warped. Ah! he is here! Enter Montalba. Mont. Down, down, ye deadliest thoughts!â I will not scare her softness with your gloom. Still, still how strange her 'haviour! when I breathed My blood-defiled confession in her ear!â Eva, mine own,âI pray thee lose no time In penning some few lines, in duteous vein, To my dear father:âhe complains how oft We do omit this dutyâchief of late. How cans't thou meet mine eye with such calm kindness? How canst thou brook my voiceâwhenâwhenâthou know'stâ How bear my presence?ânayâbe still! wild conscience!â Eva. I will obey thee, and rejoin thee here In some few minutes space. [Exit Eva. Mont. How strange it is!â Her sweetness and unaltered tendernessâ Her most unruffled gentleness and mien Of melancholyâhushed serenity Appear to rack with agonizing throesâ More than the wildest torrent of reproachâ The fiercest outbreak of aversionâhorror, Or ice of sternliest alienation could!â How is't she shows not more abhorrence:âmoreâ She showeth noneâat my unheard-of deed Of giant-guilt!âIs't from indifference born Of aught I do or have doneâall her soul Absorbed in thrilling interest for another. This cannot be! for woman's natural sense, The instinctive hate of crime, would teach herâmust, With loathing to recoil from such a fiend As I have owned myself to be, to her!â 'Tis a refinement in this retributionâ A keen perfection in my punishmentâ The injurious ingenuity of inflictionâ The delicate and deadly finish given To the dread chastisement of my black crime!â That her unchanged affectionâat the leastâ That which appears soâshould most minister To my unuttered anguish of remorse. 'Tis like the Indian torturesâthus they wringâ Not with huge, stunning strokesâbut long-drawn pangs; Not crashing through the frameâthe up-stirred flesh curdling With piercing pincers 'stead of hacking hatchets. Re-enter Eva. Eva. Enrico, I have done thy bidding.âSay, Wilt thou, beloved, thyself subjoin a line?â Mont. Nay! my sweet scribe!âsince business calls me hence. I am about to found and to endow A mighty monastery at Florence, straightâ And vast donations, largesses immense Shall drain my coffers for that holy house, Which I would make most prosperous and most affluent. There orisons shall still be offered upâ For me and mineâthy innocenceâmy guilt;â Though, but in general way, with all our house! And yearly (it doth soothe my tortured soul To dwell upon these thoughts!) shall be performed A funeral service for the virgin dead! The sacrificedâthe martyr'dâsheâthe murdered!â Ayeâmasses for her spiritâsaid and sung, Shall be repeated there to the end of time!â With prayers from all that grave community.â Oh! may this something lighten of its load My withered soul!âand in some slender sort Even reconcile my mind and thoughts to grace! Eva!âthou wilt not stay me, nor oppose In this desireâmy fortune's greater part, To dedicate to this high duty thus!â Eva. I never will oppose thee, that thou know'st! Mont. If I so steeped in the infamy of crime, Am not unworthy to pronounce such wordsâ Oh! hear me say, Heaven bless theeâblessâtheeâbless! (shuddering,)It hisses into curses on my lips!â Eva. (gently,) Oh, no! it falls like spring-dew on my soul!â Mont. Well!âwell! Anselmo waits without for me: I do remember me he waits without, On these grave matters to confer at once: I must not here detain him. Would, ah! would This hallowed edifice erected wereâ Erected, and endowed, and flourishingâ And those most solemn masses thrilling through My listening soul!âthe still small voice, half hushed, That whispers ever to that soul o'er wrungâ âThe deed!âthe deed!âthe hideous deed's despair!ââ Besidesâoblations, alms I do propose Widely through Rome and Florence to distribute!â Anselmo waitsâand I must henceâsweet wife!â Eva. Where shalt thou meet him?âgood my LordâI pray? Mont. In mine own chamber's quiet privacy. [Exit Montalba. Eva. The leech delayeth tediously!âI feel Like some lost wretch, that hath himself prepared For the last pang of dying!âkneeling down Beside the block, with the axe uplifted o'er him, That will not fallâto crushâand to release him! Yet seems each stirâeach movementâas a death!â Re-enter Reggio. Reg. Ha! lady!âthou'rt yet here!âI pray thee, sayâ Hast thou the young Prince Guido lately seen?â Eva. (coldly.) I have notâbut unnecessary seems His presence now:âI would thy thoughts were more Directed to my suffering husband! Reg. Ah! They are indeed! but fain would I awhile With the Prince Guido have consulted, ereâ (aside.Great gracious heaven!âmust I first break this news, These ghastly fatal tidings to her ear? Courage! 'twere best to speak at onceâat once!) Unhappy lady!âtremble not;âbe calm. Eva. Not tremble! and thyself thou art shivering like A leaf o'th'shaken aspen!âand more white Than the sad shroud, or sadder brow of death. I see!âI see 'tis hopeless!âyes! thou art come To blast mine ev'ry hope!âpronounce despair!â Pronounce itâthen!âand let me know the worst! Reg. Dear lady!âhist!âthy husband is not mad! Eva. (joyfully.) Not mad!âwhat think'st thou 'tis some passing dream? Some harmless aberrationâfaint and slight? Oh, joy!âMethought I was to hear despair! Reg. (solemnly.) Thou hast the worst to hearâthe deadliestâworst!â Prepare thyself!âalas!âI do repeat Those withering words!âthy husband is not mad! Himself hath not deceivedânor theeânor me! Weigh all their horrid meaning's hideousnessâ Till thou shalt pray that he were mad indeed! No dream!âno phrenzy!âno distemperânone!â Oh!âI have stunned her into stone!âshe stands All hues of life struck from her aspect's stillness! Nay, lady!âspeak!âweep!âshriek!âbut stand not thus! As the image of amazed despair's Life-Death! Eva. (starting.) What darest thou hint, old man?âwhat darest thou mean?â Not mad!âI swearâthat he is madâHE IS!â Away!âI'll say it!âshriek it to the world, And tell it out to all!âhe's raving mad! Thou dar'st not doubt it!âlook not so on me! With that appalling pity!âhe is mad!â I stake my soul, and its eternal weal On that stern truth for evermore!âdo'st hear?â I say to thee he's mad!âmost hopelessly. I say it, shout itâtill my voice, grown hoarse, Sounds like his muttered ravings! Since he's mad. He is!âunsay thy horrid words of doom! Swear it to meâthyselfâhimselfâallâall! Aye!âin the world's ear shout it!âhe is mad! Reg. Would that he were!âI cannot hint such hope! Eva. Am I becoming so?âmy brain is scorched!â My heart is all in darkness!âwho art thou? Thou ruthless man, that whisperest to my soul Perdition it had never dreamed before! Swear he is mad with me!âho! bear him off! Chain him and scourge him!âstripes and echoing blows! All that most haunted me with horrors, lateâ The solitary cellâthe bolts and barsâ The dungeon-denâthe pallet heaped with straw, Those howling wretches roundâthose shrieksâthose groansâ Those sharp-hissed blasphemiesâthose threatenings fierceâ The gnashing teeth, the unspeculative eye, The depth of all debasement and disgrace, The lazar-house of lost humanity, And the unimaginable outrages, The abominations of barbarity, The common spectacle in careless eyes, The horrible parade of ruin there,â A holiday amusement for the heartless! These things crowd back on my tormented thought, And seem beatitude to this which blasts me! A vision that shuts out the heavens above, Makes the sun blacknessâchecks the liberal air, Till 'tis one choking thick stagnation! Soâ A cell, but not the maniac's!âand a chain But not the lunatic's!âa sharp, sure strokeâ But not the lacerations of the lash!â Heavens! Heavens!âthe world hath withered from my feet! [Faints. Reg. Poor sufferer! why! 'tis better thusâwhat, ho!â Within there!âhaste!âhaste!âhelp!âyour lady's ill!â Enter Francesca and Servants. Look to the lady!âOne of you at once Conduct me to the presence of the count! Bid the lieutenant and his guards awaitâ I will instruct them in their duty soon.â Oh! heaviest day of unexampled gloom. [Exit with a Servant. Fran. Ah! my poor lady!âyet look up! look up! What dire event hath happened?âSo! she moves! Eva. (starts up.) They say he is not mad!â'tis they that rave! They too are phrenziedâworse than he is!âno They cannot that, for he is howling mad! Raving and raging, horrible and awful! Most hopelessly, irrevocably mad! Dy'e hear it all, your master is distraught? Remember, I have told yeâhe is mad! And must at once be dragged from henceâremoved; Draggedâironed and pinionedâto the asylum;âyea! Thereâto the asylumâmidst the outrageous wretches That howl their hearts away!âSpeakâswear it!âswear! All of ye swear he is most raging mad!â Fatally!âfuriously!âbear witness all! Enter Giacinta. Oh; my Giacinta!âthou wilt swear itâthou! Thou know'st Montalba's mad incurably. Gia. 'Tis thou hast told me so!â Eva. Thou dost not doubt it?â That weak old man from Florence hath been hereâ And having heard my history's long details, With ghastly mockery, swears he doth not rave.â Gia. Thou didst not tell him all! thou didst withhold That dire confession? Eva. Nothing!ânothing!âNo! That is the proof!âthe confirmation!âthat!â He is mad, thou know'st it!âand I know itâmad!â Gia. Alas!âI fear not so!âbeware how thou Dost tell him thou didst think it!âbe most sure He never will believe itâneverânever! And I can bear not witness to thy tale. (Aside,)Now must I play a deep, deep part!âconfess To her I did suspect him, but believed, From her assurance, he was now distraughtâ And hoped and thought that Reggio had not made The dark discovery of the atrocious deed; And never would, unless she did disclose it!â She must not to Montalba breathe my name. Eva. Dost thou desert me too, Giacinta? Thou?â Art leagued against me? art suborned?âart sworn! Who!âwho will help me?âI will run through Rome, Proclaiming to the general ear he's mad! For he is soâif e'er man was so yet. Gia. How much I cautioned thee, and all in vain! Myself suspected there had been foul playâ But hoped that Reggio was deceived, ne'er dreamed, That thou wouldst tell it.âThink, oh! Eva! think!â Think well what thou hast done! betrayed thy lord! Condemned him to an ignominious death!â (aside,)Oh! full, deep, royal riches of revenge!â Eva. Death!âwhy what is it?âhave men ever died?â Then how doth life inhabit yet this heart? 'Tis plain that death hath abdicated nature!â Enter Montalba followed by Reggio, Lieutenant, and Guards. Mont. to Eva. Soh! thou art there! thou true and duteous wife! 'Twas very meetâI own,âand feel 'twas rightâ Thy hand should give me to the deathman's gripe! Thou, for whose sake I thus immersed my soul In seas of sinâwhose scarlet stainsâ Eva. Thou'rt mad! Show themâmy husband! thou art stark, stark mad! The wild, clenched hands!âthe gnashing teeth!âthe eye, Rolling in red-filmed phrenzy allâ Mont. Peace! peace!â Insult me not with this most foul pretence!â And loathed parade of worst effrontery:â Thou never thoughtst me mad!âvile feint! vain fetch! To cloak the monstrous wrong of thy betrayal, Though well imagined in its treacherous trickery: Thou wouldst not have all the outraged world exclaim, The wife betrayed the husband!âgave him up To justice, and the headsman, and the scaffold! The ingenious artifice I must admire, But cannot hug the cloudâand be deceived! Eva. My husband!âOh! my husband!â Mont. Right well played! What! thou pretend'st to love me, Hypocrite! So! art in love with murder!âit may be Some dark attraction thou mayst see in all This hideous circumstance of funeral horror, Which thou wouldst trumpet thus to the echoing world!â Or haply art in love with Death?âand think'st Thou wilt look on me with more tenderness, When the eye no longer can glance back to thine,â The breath that bless'd thee ne'er again shall flutterâ The lip can never more sigh, love for loveâ And the soul's shadow passes from its glassâ The countenanceâas breath doth from the mirror! As that last dying breath from the unstained chrystal!â Strange amorous fancy this!âThink'st I believe it? Aye! wring those hands! blood glues their palms together! Thy husband's!âand the blood too that he shed For thy sole sakeâthou murd'ress of the murderer!â And toss those arms, whose dark embrace wasâdeath!â Beat that black heartâfar hollower than the grave,â And tear thy hairâit should be writhing snakesâ And hissing serpents, beauteous Gorgon!âoff! Eva. Burstâheart!âmy husband!â(Falls on her knees before him.) Mont. Off! I tell thee, off! When I am dying, through thy loving deedâ Then, vampire! come and suck my heart's-blood, then!â Not nowâthou scorpion-smiler! canst not wait? Wait for the full feast of thy dark delightâ The fruits of thy fiend-execrated falsehood!â (For e'en the very demons loathe thy deed, And seem like white-stoled angels near thy soul, Shutting their gates against thee with a curse!) Wait! wait! I say!âif thou canst deign to pause Till I am goneâand thou in Guido's arms!â Aye! what!âthou dost not start!âthou knowst it's trueâ That I am sacrificed to this, thy love; Oh! deep concerted webs of wickedness!â Oh! murderous weaver of these mingled meshes!â Reg. I swear thou wrong'st her!â Mont. Peace! accomplice! peace! Thou wert her kind assistant in this work; The web's well wrought; but 'tis so finely finished, That, look! 'tis all transparent,âtruth shines through it! Oh, Eva! thou, the adored, and now the accursed! False heart! foul mind! thou faithless, fatal thing!â Eva. Curse on! curse on!âI feared in my worst pangs,â I feared thou wouldst forgive me!âthat, Oh! that I never could have borne!âThy scorn!âthy hate! Aye! thy injustice are so many mercies! But thy forgiveness were the o'erflowing drop!â No!âno!âthou'rt not unjust!âI merit all! Kill me! Oh! kill me! soul and body kill! My sin's the consummation of all crime, All devilish instincts must have woke in me, To urge me on to that most deadly error!â Yes! yes! the fiends in their fierce flames abhor me!â And shut their gates against my blacker soul!â Say notâI knew not of it!âNature's self Should have some warning felt! Oh! dead, dumb sense! Dumb, dead, and blind-bound spirit!âthe earthquake comes, But there are portents heralding its presence.â This, my unconscious crime, frowns more colossal, In deadly hideousness, in murderous mysteryâ Than all the consciousâpreconcerted crimes, That manâconfronting condemnation's worstâ E'er yet committedâor e'er yet conceived!â [At this moment Guido rushes in, wounded slightly, and disordered, bearing Flora in his arms. Guido. My life!âmy love!âmy bride!âmy own betrothed one! Look up!âthou'rt safe! (Sees the group before himâstops amazed.) What means this strangest scene? Montalba!âguards!âand Eva's very ghostâ So death-like ashy pale!â Mont. It means thus much!â In these few wordsâthe murderer of thy sister Behold in me! Guido. (Staggering back.) Heavens! Mont. In this woman's shape The fiend that could betray him!âyetâha!âhist Who calledst thou thy love! thy bride! reply? Who is thy bride?âthy love?âdost clasp her? Guido. Aye! Oh! I am staggered!âsickening with this shock! And must I take this horror to my soul; Wert thou indeed then Bianca's murderer? Mont. Yes!â And thine, poor Eva!âinjured, outraged wife!â Flora, (starts up,) What dreadful thing hath thrill'd upon my ear?â What awful scene is opening on my vision? Why, Eva! Eva!âis't then thus?âOh, ruin!â Reg. to Guido. And could I thee suspect, my noblest boy! Guido. Thou didst!âfirst now I thread thy conduct's maze!â Reg. (aside,) My noble, faultless boy!âmy guiltless, wronged one! [Gia. pale and trembling is about silently to steal out, but is stopped by Guido. Guido. Nay!âpause!âGiacinta!âhere thy presence seems Required,âmost urgently.âStrange things have chanced Myself and Flora, near thy palace gardens, Where thou hadst left us for some five brief minutesâ Beside a fountain, whose cool wave had tempted, Were suddenly attacked by three masked men; To whom I did oppose resistance fierce,â Most fortunately with my arms provided,â While Flora's piercing shrieksâthere roughly seized By these foul ruffiansâhappily were heard By Della Moriaâpassing not far off;â He flew to render his assistance!âsoon We mastered then, these miscreants:âtwo escapedâ The third, who seemed their leader, deeply hurt, Lies bleeding on the pavement; (turns to Giacinta;) and methinks, If I not strangely erredâhe stammered out Thy name, when urged to own his motiveâthere! [Gia. totters against a pillar for support. Gia. Such villains ever seek, in their foul deeds, To implicate some high and noble name! Guido. Lieutenant!âtwo of thy good guard I ask, To accompany my steps, and bear the burthen Of the hurt ruffian to this house! Lieut. My prince! These men will follow youâthe rest and I, Awaiting your return, move not from hence.â [Guido and Two Guards Exeunt. Gia. (aside.) Black ruin stares at me from ev'ry side! But I am strong and dreadless to the last! Mont. My Eva! no, not mine, thy place is heaven! And I am of the accursed. Eva. Hush! hush!âor curse me! Not thy forgiveness, any thing but that!â Strike me! Oh, strike me dead now at thy feet! If such a miserable wretch CAN die! Mont. Thou angel of all love and purity, Why didst not clear thyself when I accused Thy spotless heart of being Guido's fee? Eva. I clear myself!âI pray heap curse on curse! I could not bear thy pardon nor thy blessing! Soh!âSoh!âthe judge, the scaffoldâand the grave! The victim, where?âthe monster-murd'ressâwho?â Mont. Nay, Eva! thou hast been thus the unconscious cause, The unwilling and the unwitting cause, beloved, Of this catastrophe and gloomiest end To all my sufferings!âwilt not smoothe nor soothe My pathâmy perilous passage to the grave? Eva. Oh! most beloved oneâwilt thou slay me now With this thy pardon? Mont. Say such words no moreâ For my last comfort say not such again!â I charge thee by thy loveâthy love for me! Nor more reproach thyselfâI cannot bear it!â Thou bright, thou sovereign excellence of virtue!â Thou dove of never-changing gentleness!â Good angels guard thee for their own pure Bandâ And endless blessings strew thy spotless paths, And smile around thee everlastingly!â Know'st thou, my Eva! 'tis in thy sole power To make me go to my most shameful grave With something almost kin to comfort yet: Even earthly comfort;âwilt thou swear to me Thou wilt accede to whatsoe'er I ask? Eva. How can I learn to oppose theeâdid I ever?â Needs it to swear?âOh! Cruel!âneeds it that? Mont. Remember, then, and disappoint me not, When I call on theeâEva! my beloved!â For I will call on theeâand deeply claim Thy blessed promise, Evaâmine adored. Eva. Oh! those sweet words, like keen-edged swords, they smite!â Rain bitterness once more upon my headâ Oh! no!âthou bidd'st me bear thy dear forgiveness!â And I will gird my soul to endure it thus. But 'tis too torturingly deliciousâstill!â And doth excruciate this unworthy heart With too much love's and too much sorrow's pangs!â Enter Guido and Della Moria, with the two Guards and the wounded Brigand, Ludovic, and Count Giulio Monzano. Giu. (to Gia.) Woe! woe! Giacinta! I have heard the wholeâ Thy spy, the page, hath told me all, alas!â Haste!âfly with me ere 'tis too lateâoh! come!â Gia. Noâurge me notâfor I feel rooted here! Besides, they watch meâthey suspect:âpeace!âpeace!â Moria. Alas!âMontalba!âis it thus with thee? Mont. Hast measured the awful mountain of my guilt?â Hast fathomed the ebbless tides of my despair?â Moria. Guido hath told me all.âHeaven pardon thee!â 'Tis horrible!â'tis hideous!âbut thou art human; And human passions do begin where fiends Leave off dismayed, and but look on amazed!â And thou'rt about to expiate thy black crime! Heaven's saints of grace have mercy on thy soul! Giulio. (to Gia.) I do implore thee, fly!ânay! be advised!â Gia. But for the hope that all may yet be saved!â Could the blow now be struckâthe alarm but givenâ Could I elude their watchful scrutiny! (turns to go with Giulio.) Flora (to Gia.) Nay, stay, Giacintaâthou shalt not escape!â Guido. ReggioâI pray theeâbind this ruffian's hurtâ Staunch the wide woundâ(to Guards)âbring waterâso!â'tis well. Gia. (to Giulio.) Go thou!âthou'rt not suspected;âat the leastâ Thou'rt implicated not in this assault.â (Alas! this Ludovic hath all our papers!â) Thou may'st steal hence, methinks, yet unobservedâ I fear no hope is left!âif all is lost,â Fly to the frontiersâthere remain concealed;â Some chance,âsome change may yet befriendâno more!â No more!âif thou dost love meâhence! at once!â [Exit Giulio. Guido. Now search the villain!â [Giacinta steals round to where the Brigand is lying. Hark! he strives to speak. Ludo. Signiors!âthe countessâ [Giacinta springs at him, and grasps him by the throat. Gia. Speak notâor thou diest! Ho! give them here!âthe papers!âyield! or die!â Ludo. (struggling.) Help! help!âunhand me! Guido. Do your duty, guards!â Keep back the ladyâsearch the prisonerâSoh! Lieutenant, take these papers. Ludo. It was herâ The Countess di Castellanaria who Commanded us to seize yourself, my prince!â And the young maid, and bear ye to our dens, Far in the mountains,âand to strike and slay, If ye resistedâHo! I choke,âI faint! Andânay! I can no more.âHelp! help!âI die! The black blood gushes in such spouting streams! Guido. Giacinta!âbut I sound thy sea of hate! Hate,âborn of treacherous and the unworthiest love! Gia. (turning from him to Ludo.) Aye! choke and die!âthou recreant craven!âdie! Thou murder-mongering slaveâthou miscreant Judas! Ere from that foul, black blood spring serpent-broods, To empoison earth with thy contagious life!â Ludo. Is't so? ungrateful and ungracious sorceress!â Yet one word moreâshe heads these threatened feuds, Whose dark details yon papers will unfold, As I conjecture, though I ne'er have op'd them; And since thou spurn'st me in my mortal hour, Have at theeâthusâthough I should die i'the deed! [The Brigand raises himself on his elbow, then flings his poniard at her, which she escapes, and overcome with the exertion, he groans and dies. Gia. (aside,) Death art so coy, so chary!â'twere ill-missed!â Lieut. This death's unfortunateâsince it had been well He had survived to give more evidence!â Signors, these papers do contain, in full, Particulars of a most villainous plot And foul conspiracyâdesignedâhatched hereâ Aimed 'gainst the Imperial Austrian Government!â Most chiefly in Venetian Lombardy With minor plots, and treasonous schemes combined. The Countess di Castellanaria's name Appears conspicuous at the head and front, Throughout these revolutionary scrolls. Thus in strict custody must she be placed, Until such time as shall be further known The pleasure of the Imperial Government; Also of Tuscanyâwhere likewise seems Some outbreak contemplatedâand besides Must we advise straight with the authorities O'the administration of the Siciliesâ For Naples doth appear inwoven with These projects of rebellion.âNay, no doubt, On further searching through these documents, Rome will be found to be not left untouched, So widely branching seems this treasonous tree! So thick the ramifications from this root! Flora (to Guido.) Where is that youthful Frenchman?âdoubtless he Was in this plot engaged. Guido. But now I met him, Posting with furious flying speed, from Rome, Haply upon some secret mission sent. Gia. (to Mont. in a sombre tone.) Hast thou no stone to throw at me?â'twere strange!â Mont. Fear not, GiacintaâI will ne'er betray thee! Gia. Thou hast done that enough alreadyâwretch! And driven me to despair's worst recklessness, Goading me on to these stern deeds of ill!â For through the treachery of thy loveless heart My life and soul were made one angry gloom.â I built this temple of ambition all, From shattered ruins of the shrine of love!â Mont. Upbraid me not!âthis scarce should be the hour For vain recriminations and reproach!â Gia. All hours for that!âyearsâtimeâthe eternity!â Yes!âI'll upbraid thee as thy conscience should. Mont. And dothâcould'st know my pangs thou wert content! Enter De Tours and Della Moria, guarded by a Sergeant and several men. Serg. Lieutenant!âSeeing suddenly emerge From out this house, (where we well knew your errand,) With stealth and fluttered mien, a cloaked-up man, Betraying doubt and anxious indecision In every step and gesture, we thought good To seize him straightforth, and convey to you!â This youthful stranger too, it seems, let fall Some words exciting wonder and suspicion, Last night, among a throng of jovial friends; And being lately seen to leave the city In flying haste, was followed, seized, and searched, And proved the bearer of seditious papers. Lieut. Good! reach the writings here.â De Tours. Unhand me, friends, I wish not, on mine honour, to escape. One day 'tis Sunâanother day 'tis Storm: The true French heart can bear and breast them both! Gia. Brave stranger!âShame!âwe are vanquished!â De Tours. Vanquished! No!â 'Tis not a French thought, nor a French word that! We are thus the losers of this day's light lottery, Baulked of our Hope by Circumstance and Chance, The unspiritually o'erruling Deitiesâ Of all things and eventsâandâbe it so! I pray you, gentlemen! unhand meâsee! You have given a most ungraceful set and air To this loose cloak.âYou have no Artistic eye!â Enter Antonio. Anto. Alas! my master! is't then thus indeed? Is there no hope?âis't shownâthat hideous truth?â Mont. My faithful, good Antonio, hast thou heard;â Still shrink'st not from me shuddering?â Anto. Know, then, know! Beloved master! that I knew it allâ But kept thy dreadful secret from thyselfâ As all the worldâI would not have thee dream Thy guilt was bared before mine eyes.âNow, now I have a solemn duty to performâ And strictly will discharge it!âI denounce And charge the Countess di Castellanariaâ As having beenâaye! not the accomplice onlyâ In this dark deed of deathâbut more, yet moreâ The originatress and promoter too Of that dread crime!âlord count! I cannot save, But I can show thy sin thus undesignedâ Thine unpremeditated crime, was more From weakness and wild passion's impulse born, Artful suggestion and temptation's goad, Than hardihood of the evil-purposed mind!â I pray ye all give ear to my dark tale. Some days before the marriage of the count With Bianca Bellafiore, was to be, With circumstance of splendour, solemnized, Passing by chance a door closed carelessly, I heard the countess parleying with my lord. It was a festaâall the household else Were joining them in the out-door's revelry;â I listenedâriveted by what I heard:â Thus spake the countess to my lordââAnd what! Hast ne'er heard of Venetian braceletsânor Of flower-wreathed bowls, with costly draughts within,â A pearl than Cleopatra's gem more rich, A pearl that Cleopatra ne'er possessed,â (Not till the asp dived for't in her blue heart-veins!â) Dissolved in the all-inestimable draught! Thisâshall the reveller, and ere long, endow With peace eternal and the sweetest sleepâ Suffering, shame, sorrow, ne'er shall harm him more!â Exemption this shall bring from all the earth's woes,â And purchase blessingsâev'n from enemies!â All men's good words and praisesâsince all Men Abuse the Livingâbut admireâthe Dead!â Guido. Cold-hearted murderessâif not such in act, In thought and in intentâOh! horrible!â (Aside.)Was this the soul I thought athirst,âon fire, For Freedomâglorious Freedom?âsevenfold shame, Thus to disgrace with guilt's unsanctioned soul The cause that Angels and the Archangels hail! Anto. The count abruptly turned and left her then, Rendering not answer to these horrid words. It chanced that at that crisis I was called From Florence to Verona hastily, Where mine ag'd mother on her death-bed lay;â My thoughts were in her sufferings all absorbed. When I returned to Florence I first heard The affianced bride had suddenly been seized By a most fearful illnessâand had died!â Then I bethought me of that ghastly speech, But breathed to none these dire suspicionsânoneâ Lest my dear master haply might be wronged. 'Twas some time after, that, in deep discourse, I marked the countess and my lord once more, And felt resistlessly constrained to listenâ Deeming it touched on that sad mystery. With vehement, sharp reproaches she assailedâ Upbraided him with keen and cutting tauntsâ âDidst thou not ever show thy lack of love, If to no other eyesâat leastâto mine? How wert thou wont to heave heart-breaking sighs, Choosing me ever for thy confidantÃ©!â âAlas! Giacinta!âmust Iâmust I wed?â Could I interpret this into aught else But hate of her through growing love for me?â And now forsoothâthy horrorâthy remorseâ Conscience and conscienceâfaugh!âthat sickening prate! â Guido. And I could think this creature starry bright? Ant. Then thus, my lord:ââBut thou didst urge the deedâ Nay! laid the dread temptation in my way. Showing the deathly poison that thou said'st Thou ever borest about theeâlest some shock Of sorrow should make life become a load Intolerably heavyâhaunted still With some strange superstition of suspicions; And when thou heard'st Bianca's gentlest steps, Didst hurrying leave me with that mortal bane.â There, thereâat handâto try meâtempt meâthere!â This I most solemnly attestâand charge The Countess di Castellanaria thus. Eva. Oh! my Montalba! half thy guilt is gone. Gia. May the foul fiends yet double it and treble, With wicked thoughts worse prompting theeâtill death.â De Tours. Lady! look up! I nothing see, I own, That doth condemn thee much, or criminate!â The stars were wrong perchance, but thou wert right! Extenuating Circumstances clear thee,â In my sight clear thee utterly of guilt! The charming young Bianca could not please Her destined lordâhis honour did oppose All breach of faithâ'twere best that she should die,â Best for all parties;âfor herself 'twas nought,â She fell asleep in Beauty, Youth, and Hope; Her lifeâone Rose! whose leavesâLove's precious blushes, Fell in their fragranceâfell in all their freshness, By thy hand shaken from the stalk at once, Uncankered and unwitheredâthis was well!â Then for the count a generous deed thou didst, His life had else been sacrificed to sorrow; He would have grown morose, austere, cold, formal, Wrinkled before his time, and bent and yellow; For discontent is evermore a foe Both to the constitution and complexion. Thyself, sweet lady, loved!âand felt of course Constrained to do thyself such act of justice; In short, the affair was unavoidable. Full oft have I remarkedâthrough life indeedâ That the most wicked acts have generally The very worthiest motives;âdid we thus Sift to the bottom all our neighbours' deeds, We should assuredly discover still That crimesâso calledâare almost always virtues;â Murderers have mostly philanthropic motives; Thefts are oft done with excellent intentionsâ And so on through the catalogue of crime! I doubt what some one said of madness late, That 'twas the sane were shut upâthe insane loose, Would hold to the innocent and guilty too,â That is, to the unaccused, and to the arraigned!â The miscalled criminals are the ornaments To human nature, and should leave their cells To the occupation of the imagined virtuous!â Lieut. Bear the male prisoners hence! disarmed and handcuffed. De Tours. What! Sir!âallow me! I can suffer not This vile indignity!âFarewell! Messieurs!â My destiny's accomplished, that I feel.â For GloryâHonourâFreedomâFameâFranceâthis! [Shoots himself. Gia. Young fervent, fiery spirit!âart thou flown?â Away!âthe die is castâthe game is up!â Well!âI have lost!âI stood the chance!âand standâ This, the adverse issue!âas unshrinkingly!â My heart's one adamantâmy soul's all iceâ And this rich sweetness of revengeâat least Flatters my lips in this black cup of death!â Mont. Shame!âshame!âGiacinta!âbut thou rav'st. (To Della Moria.) My friend! I fain would speak some few last words with thee! Gia. The ashes of ruin are not bitter all, Touched with the ambrosial taste of that revenge. Stand upâthou totteringâfaultering trembler!âthereâ Thou death-struck Eva!âlet me see thy face!â So! it was thou that charmed him from my sideâ And I have gently led thee by the hand; Taught thee and trained thee to my purposes, Till thou'st erected for thy much-loved lordâ Erected part by partâand piece by piece, With skill and tender care and watchful zeal, The scaffold of his shame-embittered death! Nor wert thou happy in the officious work. I revelled in thine agonies of soul, When thou wert mourning o'er Montalba mad! And could'st believe I thought the same as thee?â Poor fool! much, much too easy preyâscarce worth The trouble of this torturing;âyet I die The happier that I leave thee wretched here!â Though scarcely can I hate thee as I would! Thou chill, insipid imageâcut in clay! Flora. Such happiness outmeasures our vast woe With withering throes of cankered bitterness! Gia. Greatâglorious scheme!âand borne through gloriously!â To make the adoring wife the unconscious means Of bringing ruin, shameâand such a deathâ And worse than such a deathâa Memory slainâ On her lost husband's head!â Eva. Oh! murder me!â As thou didst Bianca!âmurder me!âstab home!â But strike!âstrike home!âstrike heart-deep!âand at once!â Mont. (to Gia.) Silence, Giacinta!âcheck thine impious tongue! Lest Heaven should smite thee dead with angry thunder! Gia. Let heaven rain thunderbolts upon me!âsee! They fall notâHo!â(snatches the poniard from the floor.) I will forestall them thus! [Stabs herself and dies. Mont. Delivered from a demon thus seems the earth! Guido. And can that life's tempestuousness lie hushed?â Be mercy showered on herâshe never showed!â Mont. (to Eva.) My pitying angel of forgiveness!ânow, E'en now I claim thy solemn promise:âhear! First know, I make compliance with my willâ Of my forgiveness the one great condition! Eva. Thou knowest compliance must anticipate Thine every hinted wish!â [Montalba takes her hand and joins it with Della Moria's. Mont. Thusâthen!ânot so!â Nay! start not back, with that bewildered look Of eloquent anguish!âPromise me, even now Promise me thou wilt one day be his bride! He doth complyâwilt thou resist and brave me? Eva. Oh! thou canst never mean it!â Mont. Solemnly!â And wish it fervently!âConsent at onceâ Consent to these espousals!âor once more Will I withdraw my pardonâonce more launch My curse against thee.âDearest! for my sake I pray theeâdo implore theeâby thy love!â What!âshall I go to mine untimely graveâ My deep, dishonoured, foul and blood-stained grave, With this most crushing thought upon my soulâ Both have I blighted, ruined, murdered both!â Bianca and Eva!âboth destroyedâundoneâ Murdered the one i' the bodyâbut yet worseâ The other in the soulâwhose peace I wreckedâ Whose hopes I crushedâwhose life I made all death!â Eva. (wildly.) Alas! alas!âwhat heard I!âwhat is this?â Dread altar for the espousals of the wretchedâ Dark temple for the marriage-ritesâTHY graveâ Wreathe the poor victim for the sacrifice With funeral fitnessâ Mont. Silence!âhear me outâ If thou hast e'er loved me thou'lt love him too!â If thou dost love me now thou'lt try to love him; If thou wilt love my memoryâthou must love him!â He is my very self of happier days!â He is my nobler selfâwhen innocence Was white at my young soul, my nature seemed Glassed in the clear, pure waters of his being!â The chrystal there yet gleams in every wave, My billowy soul heaves thrice incarnadinedâ Give me the promise!âgive it me at once! Moria. Nay, hush, my friendâ'tis more than she can bear! Mont. Wilt thou not smoothe my passage to the grave? Eva! I told thee still 'twas in thy power To pour one drop of comfort in my cup!â And thou refusest me!âthen all my soul Shall go remorseless to the abyss of ruin!â Eva. Talk not so wildly!âtake my hand!â'tis thine, Thine own!âdo with it as thou wiltâbut bless me! Mont. My heavenly Love! the sharpness of this deathâ The bitterness of this abhorrent doom I can smile from me now!âcan wave away!â Submit in silence, and in peace expire!â My noble, noblest friendâyes! he is all That yet should make thy final happiness!â Aye; he is all, and more than all that makes Nobility without its title!âstill He hath, with lineage high as his own heartâ All worldly circumstance of honour tooâ All worldly gift, and grace, state, power and wealth!â Eva. Oh! speak not of this worldâ'tis all one waste!â Mont. Eva! If e'er thou lov'dst meâthen, Oh! then I charge thee love him! and in him love me! He is my second loftier self!âI knew I was inferior ever in the gifts Of mind and intellectâbut heart to heart We feltâwe feveredâin life's holier daysâ For all things high and true and bright and pure!â Love me an hundred fold yet more in him! At leastâgive me this promiseâI beseech, That thou for my sake, sweet, wilt try to loveâ Then still, for my sake, yield thy handâas heart!â Eva. Alas! do with me what thou wiltâTHINE OWN! Mont. Now I am happier than I e'er have been Since that tremendous hour!âyet my poor father!â Thou only!âbut away with these vain thoughtsâ Enough!âI will not now unman myself! My happiness before was worst despair. If e'er I dreamed of joy I felt 'twas falseâ Myself and madness knew 'twas mockery all!â And jarred it into misery; for remorse, Fevering the o'erboiling fountains of the soul, Makes the dread madness of the raging heart!â Enter Anselmo, the Friar. Anselmo. Most true, my son! but raise thine eyes to Heaven! Let madness of remorse become now changed To grace of sweet repentance' healing power! Thou hast ta'en steps thy peace with Heav'n to make; Thou hast full lately with zeal's fervour made Some reparation!âdedicating half Of thy vast fortune to the Church's good!â 'Twas a most saintly, true munificence!â Now without murmuring meet thy chastisement, And go in penitenceâto sleep in peace.â Still at thy side, till thy last mortal hour, Will I be found to administer, as due, All consolations for thy suffering spirit!â And, lo! in the offices of piety, In the exercise of solemn duties thusâ E'en in thy dungeon thou shalt glimpse more joy Than e'er thou triedst to think thine own, ere yet This dread disclosure of thy crime was made, And dead remorse grew waken'd, warm'dâraisedâkindled, By full confession, to a live repentance!â Mont. Father! thou'rt right!âmy soul's dark gates unlockedâ I feel that all the Christian flows again!â Crime cannot know a joyânor snatch a hope!â Nor feed on peaceânor lull itself in trust!â Sin in triumphal pomp of glorying state, Might unopposed and uncondemned, ascend The Throne of the orb-throng'd Universes all, And so be trebly tortured, since self-cursed!â Eva!âyet mine one moment!âTO MY SOUL! [She springs forward, and falls heavily at his feet. Flora. She faints!âshe falls!âOh! Saints in Heaven!âshe! dies!â The blood is flowing from her lips!âWoe!âwoe!â Some artery sure in the o'erwrung frame hath burst! Mont. Oh! God!âwhat dreadful change is this!âlook up! What!âblood!âI did not shed it!âI am crushed!â Eva!âmy Eva!âMine!âAwake!âreturn!â Mine all!âmine only!âMINEâfor evermore! Gui. Thou lovely sufferer!âall thy pains are past! Mont. Return!âawake!âOh, Eva!ânay!âso best! Thee sorrow never more shall wring and wound! Thy woes are pastâall, all thy woes are o'er! Guido! I thank thee for that thoughtâthat thought!â Eva in Heaven!âthou Sainted One and savedâ Thou Angel among Angels!âplead for me!â Plead for the Sinner!âfor the Mourner pleadâ Thouâthe Innocentâthe Ill-fated One!âon Earth! Thou more than Bless'd and Bright and Freeâabove! THE END.</field>
