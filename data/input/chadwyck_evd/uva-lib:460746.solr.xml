      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. FERDINANDO. CARRAVAGIO. ANTONIA. TERESA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The stage represents a magnificent saloon, adorned with paintings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. ANTONIA. My heart is full of heaviness and fear! I blush and tremble like a guilty wretch; And yet of guilt and shame what have I done? Last night my lord was late abroad with friends, And save the servants with him, all the house Was gone to rest ere I had sought my room. As wont my chamber door was left unbarr'd; But I was sunk to sleep before he came. He spoke not to me, and before the dawn Departed hastily while yet I drouz'd. Did he not come? Have I but strangely dreamt? O righteous Heav'n, drive from my madding brain Th'opprobious fantasy that seeks admission. SCENE II. Antonia and Teresa. TERESA. Come my dear lady, do not weep so sadly; The count has promis'd to be here at noon. It was, 'tis true, a wayward prank of him, So on the sudden to set out for Florence.â But these deep-drinking Englishâ ANTONIA. Oh my heartâ TERESA. Though he were lost you could not sorrow more. ANTONIA. Oh! he is lost to meâand I am lostâ Undone, undone; for ever, evermore! TERESA. Why yield to such a passion of despair? ANTONIA. Not to inform me!â TERESA. âAll a riot flight. 'Twas Ferdinando begg'd to come and tell, Else had we still been in a deeper trouble. ANTONIA. Ha! Ferdinando begg'd!âHorrible slave! To traffic so between my lord and me! Where slept the angels of the pure and chaste, When the foul profanation was perform'd! SCENE III. TERESA. Alas, poor soul! she takes it sore to heart; And yet, methinks, it was no deadly sin, For count Urbano, in a frolic fit, To see his foreign friends safe to the town. Had he but sent a loving note to herâ But wine that with an uproar steals the sense, Has no respect for duteous courtesies.â Why should she rage at Ferdinando so? He did right well, and seems to deeply mourn The rash excess that so betray'd his master. SCENE IV. Ferdinando and Teresa. FERDINANDO. How does my lady? TERESA. Sadly, weeping sad. 'Tis very strange that she should so bewail. FERDINANDO. Does she suspect? TERESA. How! what should she suspect? FERDINANDO. Why I did not inform her when I came. TERESA. And did you not? FERDINANDO. No; for she was asleep. TERESA. How knew you that? Went you into her chamber? FERDINANDO. She made no answer when I rapp'd the door. TERESA. So then you open'd it, and dar'd to enter! FERDINANDO. What could I else? TERESA. You found her then asleep? FERDINANDO. Why look you at me so inquisitive? TERESA. That you should dare to be so bold as enter. What said you to her to affright her so? FERDINANDO. Nothing. TERESA. Nothing! how? When you told herâ FERDINANDO. âAy. TERESA. Perhaps she did not hear? FERDINANDO. I think she did. TERESA. And you came out, not knowing if she knew? FERDINANDO. I did. What said she when you spoke to her; When you inform'd her that our lord was gone? TERESA. Are you then sure she heard you not last night? FERDINANDO. I cannot tell. But what says she to-day? TERESA. Why ask you me so often? She is sad; Sad as a new-made widow for her lord. FERDINANDO. I think I will to Florence to my master. TERESA. You will to Florence! wait upon our lady, And tell her better than you did last night. FERDINANDO. What can I more? You have already told her. TERESA. I pray you go. FERDINANDO. And is she much distress'd? Think you she will be angry when she sees me? TERESA. Why should she? Sure it was no fault of yours? FERDINANDO. The door was open, and I thought she heard. TERESA. You thought she heard! FERDINANDO. In truth I did, Teresa. TERESA. 'Tis very strange!âGo, get you hence, audacious. SCENE V. TERESA. There is some hideous mystery in this.â She is almost distracted in her thoughts. Yet is this wretch that was the messenger Not certain if she heard him when he told. For then he says she slept; and yet he thinks That she did know of his presumptuous entrance. Why should he fear her anger? Or why she So kindle to distraction at his name? Heav'ns, could the varlet be so bold!â Could she in sleep, unconscious, be betray'd? O wretched lady! O ill-fated fair! So chaste, so excellent to thy lov'd lord.â But let me not to such conceptions yield; If she has been a partial hypocrite, And heard the curs'd intruder in the room.â The painter here! why has he left his work? It is not usual with this studious man. SCENE VI. Teresa and Carravagio. TERESA. What seek you signor Carravagio here? CARRAVAGIO. The countess wants you; she is very ill. TERESA. She parted from me but few minutes since, And then complain'd not: only griev'd to think The count so hastily had gone to Florence. CARRAVAGIO. Has nothing else befallen? TERESA. As I hope. Think you that she has other cause to grieve? CARRAVAGIO. Something most fatal has occurr'd last night. The countess seem'd as one would like to paint: Lucretia when she had escap'd from Tarquin. TERESA. She mourns this luckless frolic of her lord. CARRAVAGIO. No, no; her grief is of a deeper wound. TERESA. Why signor Carravagio think you so? CARRAVAGIO. The painter's art instructs him to discern The movements of the spirit in the face. Before this anguish, keen and terrible, She still has worn a countenance serene; Modest, though buxom, and though blooming, mild, Like cheerful Dian waiting for the day.â But go, she needs you. Sooth her if you can. Send Ferdinando, if you see him, to me. SCENE VII. CARRAVAGIO. The fellow has a dark lascivious leer, So blended with a sober villainous air, That he assists my fancy as I draw The story of Susannah and the elders. SCENE VIII. Carravagio and Ferdinando. CARRAVAGIO. How now, friend Ferdinando. Know you not That you have kept me idle all the morning? FERDINANDO. I was not hired to act a jewish priest. Sir, I have other duty in my place. CARRAVAGIO. The count has said whene'er I wanted you, All other service should be then postponed. FERDINANDO. But I have business, sir, in town to-day. CARRAVAGIO. Does not the count return? FERDINANDO. I cannot tell. CARRAVAGIO. Were you not with him at the Villa Fresca? I heard you were, and came home late last night. FERDINANDO. Who told you that? CARRAVAGIO. The countess did herself. Alas, poor lady! she is much distress'd. FERDINANDO. Is she? CARRAVAGIO. She is knave!âHast thou done aught wrong? FERDINANDO. What! I sir? CARRAVAGIO. Yes. FERDINANDO. Did she say aught of me? CARRAVAGIO. Thou hast a masterly command of feature. But there is fear and trouble in thine eye. 'Tis not contrition. No: and a wild hope Gleams now and then upon thy troubled fear; Like glimpsing sunshine on the wint'ry waves. What mischief hast thou done? FERDINANDO. Mischief! What I? CARRAVAGIO. What hast thou done that yet may be conceal'd? FERDINANDO. You much amaze me, sir, by what you say. CARRAVAGIO. I am but in this house, professional; Nor does it suit my nature thus to pry. But thou hast done, or I mistake my trade, Some guilty deed, that flatters thee with hope. SCENE IX. FERDINANDO. How should this cunning artist thus detect? He and Teresa have conferr'd together. The countess too has something said of me. Are they in league? Can she have made disclosure? And yet, me-thinks she would not well do that. I told Teresa, I was in the room. If I, why not another? I am safe! I will Teresa's thoughts so turn aslant, That the suspicion shall remove from me. Had but the countess been a little shrewd. 'Tis true she took me for the count.âWhat then? She may again accept me, for myself; At least, 'tis best, I think, still to remain. SCENE X. Teresa and Ferdinando. TERESA. What, Ferdinando! wherefore are you here? Not gone to Florence, nor with Carravagio? FERDINANDO. I do not like that painter in this house. TERESA. No, Ferdinando! FERDINANDO. No. How does my lady? TERESA. Dejected; thoughtful; speaking not a word. FERDINANDO. If we were in some safe and secret place, I would, Teresa, something say to you.â But is my lady very sad indeed? TERESA. Have I not told you, almost wildly sad? FERDINANDO. She spoke with Carravagio, as I know. TERESA. She did. What of it; passing to her room? FERDINANDO. Were you not present when she spoke with him? TERESA. 'Twas but a word or two, and quickly said. FERDINANDO. But what she said, you cannot truly tell? TERESA. Indeed, not I. FERDINANDO. Teresa.â TERESA. Well? FERDINANDO. Teresa; You are a woman, knowing and observant. I wish we were in some secluded room; Where no intrusion might break in upon us.â How did the painter look when you saw him? TERESA. He pitied much the countess. FERDINANDO. Pitied! These artists sure, are men of subtile craft. He pitied? TERESA. Ay! FERDINANDO. What did he know to pity? I went last night into our lady's room.â TERESA. You told me so;âa daring shame it was. FERDINANDO. Well; have you learnt though, if she heard me speak? TERESA. I did. FERDINANDO. What said she? Lookt like one that kens Dread things, invisible to mortal sight.â Just like Paulina in the picture there, When told her love was not the God Anubis, Pale agonized, almost foregone in mind. FERDINANDO. Think you the painter knows that I was there? It may be good for him to turn on me. This is a matter that cannot long hide: Let you and I, Teresa, council keep;â Have all our eyes and all our ears set open. These men of art do other things at night, Than watch the moon-light as it, brightening, falls On busts and statues in a gallery. SCENE XI. TERESA. 'Tis plain, 'tis sure she grieves not for her lord. My thoughts and fears fell first on Ferdinando: He is of that complexion, and so bold; And I have seen him gaze profanely at her. But Carravagio! True he eyes her oft; And in his study, here and there are seen, Both nymphs and goddesses, where one may trace Her comely lineaments; yet in his gaze, He looks not as a man on woman looks, But as a student pond'ring o'er a text. I should as soon expect to find him bedded With Venus or Diana, as with her. Lo, where she comes, dejected and perplext. SCENE XII. ANTONIA. My lord, you said, was to be here at noon. TERESA. So Ferdinando told me. Heard you not What he reported when he came last night? ANTONIA. Eternal horror blot the fatal night. I heard him not; I was wrapt up in sleep. Oh! my lov'd lord, that could so rashly leave Thy faithful wife defenceless while a slave.â Where is the fiend?â TERESA. Whom, my dear lady, whom? ANTONIA. The sacrilegious and infernal snake That crawled, unheard, toâ TERESA. Ferdinando? ANTONIA. âYes. TERESA. You heard him then when he was in the room? ANTONIA. Darest thou, presumptuous wench, say that I knew? TERESA. Pardon me, madam, if I say amiss. It was, indeed, an impious intrusion. ANTONIA. Ha! how intrusion? What know'st thou of it? TERESA. Was he not seen by signor Carravagio? He often walks the gallery at night. ANTONIA. Go send the painter, instantly, to me. TERESA. Here is a riddle, ravell'd and perplext! SCENE XIII. ANTONIA. If I could 'raze conviction from my mind, And think of all as an unhappy dream.â But if all know it, surely there is proof; And the poor victim of perfidious sleep, Shall be blasphem'd by all the lib'lous world: Nor will the cloister'd burial avail. SCENE XIV. Carravagio and Antonia. CARRAVAGIO. I wait obedient, lady, to your will. ANTONIA. It is not, Carravagio, wise of you, To walk and pry about the house at night. CARRAVAGIO. Some one has slandered me, to say I pry. Save in the gall'ry, when the moon is up, Or in the porticos, to study shadows, I never quit my chamber after dark. ANTONIA. Why were you in the gallery last night? The moon was down before I went to sleep, And it was pitchy dark;âa dismal night! CARRAVAGIO. My honour'd lady, credit not this tale. I had retired before eleven rung. If there were pryers in the gallery, I was not one. I never will betray. ANTONIA. Betray! What sir would you betray of mine? CARRAVAGIO. Pardon the word. ANTONIA. Sir, you may now retire. SCENE XV. ANTONIA. He never will betray! Does he then know? He went to bed before eleven rung.â How could he know, to say he'll not betray? He went to bed, but he might rise again; And he is wont to walk about at night. Triple confusion was the villain him? Ha! Ferdinando! I will sift him next. SCENE XVI. Antonia and Ferdinando. ANTONIA. How dar'd you, wretch! break, at the dead of night, Into my chamber as I sleeping lay? FERDINANDO. Was there no other there? ANTONIA. Great God! what other? FERDINANDO. Madam, 'tis true I found your door unbarr'd; Enter'd unheard, asâ ANTONIA. Wretch! you shall be torn To rags by tygers, when my lord returns. I could, myself, rive thy accursed flesh.â Oh! Heav'n!âOh! Heav'n!âto leave me so forlorn. FERDINANDO. (I'll brave her out.)âHave confidence in me. But when you next in this intrigue indulge, Dismiss him ere you sleep. ANTONIA. Whom! whom! accurst? FERDINANDO. He that usurp'd the linen of my lord; For had it been the count himself that came.â But trust to me. If you are calm and wise, I'll be as secret as your paramour. ANTONIA. Hence! hence! insulting traitor; hence! I say SCENE XVI. ANTONIA. Was it not him? 'Twas Carravagio then: Yet he has ever seem'd to me respectful; And by the enthusiasm of his art, Wholly enchanted. This detested fox Wears an audacious smile, which more than once, Has, with a terrible presage, alarm'd me. Yet Carravagio too said I was safe, For he would not betray.âBoth know it then. But which?âWho is the guilty thief of me? Whom shall I charge to my belov'd Urbano? And will he credit me? Alas! alas! I must no longer claim him for my lord. Yet, have I never felt one swerving thought From the pure tenour of my marriage vow, But ever been in my allegiance faithful. Faithful!âO God! am I a faithless wife? I, who so hop'd in lofty pride of mind, To show our sensual italian dames, That Portia, nor the mother of the Grachii, Were fictions feign'd. Oh! what have I become? Sunk to a level with the pronest vile, And most abhorrent to my wretched self.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. CARRAVAGIO. I cannot bend my thoughts upon my work, Nor dare I note what fancy would suggest. What can it be?âShe has sustain'd a wrong, Which dyes her face alternately with shame, And bleaches with disgust. Alas! poor lady. SCENE II. Teresa and Carravagio. TERESA. How! here again! Whom seek you, signor, here? You were not wont to walk in this saloon? CARRAVAGIO. This morning, Ferdinando has affairs, And I am otherwise not very well. TERESA. Not very well? CARRAVAGIO. Ay! Why should that surprise you? TERESA. You walk too much, good signor, in the night. Night is the season for refreshing sleep, And those who trespass on its lonely hours, Have cares, or fears, or troubled thoughts, or love? CARRAVAGIO. You speak oracular. My art requires That I should mark the various falling light; And who can see the moon-beam, or the lamp, Shed their true bright'ning, but when night prevails. TERESA. Cannot you be content with sun-shine hues? They charm the eye with more variety. CARRAVAGIO. It is my taste,âmy genius prompts me so. TERESA. Pray what is that? What is this genius, sir? I hear of it, yet know not what it is. CARRAVAGIO. 'Tis some peculiarity of mood, Which makes the difference between mind and mind, That figure, feature, colour, gait and air, Make between man and man.âFrom sense it comes. TERESA. How may that be? We feel, taste, hear, and smell; And saving accidents, see things alike? CARRAVAGIO. True! but the working is unknown to me. TERESA. I understand: some have a keener relish Of this or that, more than their neighbours have. CARRAVAGIO. 'Tis so, I think. Some by the ear, are charm'd With plaintive melodies, or cheerful sounds; Some by the eye, with various forms and hues. The senses are the portals of the mind; And genius enters by the most frequented, Or that which nature has constructed best. TERESA. Genius then makes, if I conceive aright, By practice, or some liveliness of sense, Men prone to find, and seize their means of pleasure; And as you oft foregoe the midnight sleep, To catch the shadows of the moony hour, Or rise in company, as I have seen you, Regardless of all decorous demeanour, To bid a stranger beauty bend aslant; Some other, by his different genius led, Would seize on chance, nor fear he might offend. CARRAVAGIO. You're wond'rous metaphysical Teresa!â But why so suddenly at odds in thought? TERESA. The moon, I think, went down at ten last night; Nor were there any lights for you at two.â How came you to be stirring at that hour? CARRAVAGIO. I! I Teresa? Wherefore ask you this? Your lady chided me, and said I pry. What has been done? What ill is thought of me? TERESA. It was at two that Ferdinando came. CARRAVAGIO. Well? TERESA. Saw you him not? CARRAVAGIO. At two last night, I? I heard eleven strike when in my bed, And slumb'ring soon, waked not before the dawn. TERESA. Was ever robb'ry more atrocious done? CARRAVAGIO. Robb'ry! am I suspected of a theft? TERESA. O no, no, no; it was not done by you. Oh! my sweet lady to be plunder'd so! How will her lov'd and loving lord deplore! SCENE III. Carravagio and Ferdinando. CARRAVAGIO. 'Tis very strange! How could they doubt of me? Why should a robb'ry crimson her with shame? Ferdinando!â FERDINANDO. Sir! well? CARRAVAGIO. (I am distrest.) FERDINANDO. If you don't want me, sir, I may retire. CARRAVAGIO. Was it at two, that you came home last night? FERDINANDO. It was: Pray what is it to you? Am I Bound to inform you of my coming home; Or when, or how, I spend my master's time? CARRAVAGIO. Friend, be not insolent. Know, sullen knave, That not thy master would so answer me. FERDINANDO. No: were he wise, he would not use his tongue. CARRAVAGIO. For this time I can pass thy insolence.â There has been done a fatal deed last night. FERDINANDO. I know there has; and do you, sir, blame me? CARRAVAGIO. Art thou afraid I should, ill-manner'd cur? But if in matter so juridical, I could persuade the world of my skill, There would not want sufficient evidence, The forehead mark of guilt is set so plain. FERDINANDO. Shall I be ruin'd by your painting fancies? What is there, sir, in this same pencil craft, To make of me a villain or a saint, But the devices of a plotting brain? CARRAVAGIO. Think'st thou, lewd epicure, thy sensual eye Can the fine workings of the mind discern, As they develope to the painter's sight; Or that my art but ministers to pomp, And has no influence in that holy process, Which separates the pure celestial mind, From such vile carnal dross, as rules in thee? The painter's pencil, in expression true, Conveys a moral like the poet's pen; And feelings faithful on the easel limm'd, Instruct the spirit and improve the heart, Like eloquence, with all the shades of phraze, Or poetry, embodied on the stage. Go; fear my skill; and if thou can'st, atone; For thou hast done that which I dread to think.â A deed so dark, leads to a deadly sequel. SCENE IV. Teresa and Ferdinando. TERESA. Stop! traitor, stop! or if there be a name Of more perfidious villany expressive, I'll call thee that, incarnated of Hell! FERDINANDO. What means the woman with this noisy riot! TERESA. Thou smooth unfathomable villany, To vent the dev'lish venom of thy guile, With such insidious plausibility Against an honest and unworldly man! FERDINANDO. Think you, the painter then is innocent? Think you that one so skill'd in trimming hues, Is yet so little practiced in his craft As not to make his visage for the time?â I've been the valet of our lord the count, Ten years and more; and he is but a stranger: In all that time, what ill know you of me; What good of him? TERESA. I know that you have been A flagrant master of my silly sex, While he has but a mastership attain'd In forms and shades: spare fruit of patient study. FERDINANDO. How should he know of what was done last night? Answer me that. What spirit serves his ear, To give advertisement of secret things? Grant him the skill to spy into our thoughts; 'Tis but the present thought that rules the face; Still as it shifts, a different guize succeeds; How then should he know of an act that's past? He could as well tell when you went to sleep As know this secret, had he not been told. Was he a witness, or a party, think you? But what, Teresa, does the countess say? TERESA. She sits disconsolate, and only sighs, Or starts, as 'twere, by sudden anguish stung; And frantic flutt'ring, flies from room to room. FERDINANDO. When was't she told you what had pass'd? TERESA. Told me! She never told me. FERDINANDO. No! How knew you then? TERESA. I guess'd of something dismal by her grief, And when you told me you were in the room.â Why do you beat upon your brow so fiercely? FERDINANDO. Did she not send you to enquire? TERESA. Not she. FERDINANDO. Why stir you then so busily in it? TERESA. Think you that such a thing should chance, and I Not seek to learn the truth and circumstance. FERDINANDO. We are, Teresa, but a pair of fools. In all this, there may be but our conception. Sift you herselfâ'tis meet she should be vext,â That such as I broke in upon her sleep. TERESA. But how came you to think of Carravagio? FERDINANDO. I learnt from you what had, or may have, chanc'd, And knowing his nocturnal rambles thoughtâ TERESA. You turn my fancy, fellow, all awry; I may be wrong, and yield to false conceits, Or thou art but a deep and deeper knave. SCENE V. FERDINANDO. I have o'er-leap'd myself. Had I not told This curious lynx of being in the room, The countess still, perhaps, had nothing said. Lo where she comes!âI'll stand apart and spy. SCENE VI. Antonia and Ferdinando. ANTONIA. Let me no longer bend to this despair; While I exhaust myself, with useless passion, The secret Tarquin may escape secure. Shame that restrains the speaking of my wrong, Is, in this case, the minister of guilt.â What though I may to cloister'd sorrow go, Who will believe my chastity of mind, If I depart and leave the spoiler free?â Let me be calm and patient to discover Which by the loathsome Belial is possess'd. Why should I doubt? But still the fiend denies And speaks as if he saw!âPeace, peace my heart; 'Tis done, 'tis doneânor sighs nor tears avail. No sigh can turn the moment wafted by; Nor tear obliviate the guilty stain.â How my brain kindles when this wretch appearsâ Ferdinando!â FERDINANDO. Madam!â ANTONIA. Hither; art there? FERDINANDO. (She overawes me!âwhat can ye intend?) ANTONIA. How dar'd you violate?âO God! O God! And must I stoop to speak on such a theme? What devil tempted you into my room? No more prevarication; well you know There was no other, but yourself, with me. FERDINANDO. You knew me then? ANTONIA. Say not, hell-fox, I knew. FERDINANDO. Softly, sweet lady, be a little wise, No one may know if we are shrewd ourselves; 'Tis true you knew me not. But nowâshe's mad! SCENE VII. FERDINANDO. This flaming rage is female artifice. Had I not told Teresa all was fafeâ Had I suppress'd that I was in the room, And sent the mouser prying through the house, All had gone well.âCurse on my cautious fear: My rash precaution has betray'd the whole. SCENE VIII. Carravagio, Teresa, and Ferdinando. CARRAVAGIO. Ha! Ferdinando! friend, art thou discover'd? TERESA. At length together I have found them both.â Stay Ferdinando, for I come to speak, And face to face bring out the dismal truth. FERDINANDO. Who gave you right? TERESA. Who gave me right! FERDINANDO. Ay, who? TERESA. Shall deeds of such opprobrious act be done, And no one dare to search how, or by whom! CARRAVAGIO. Humanity, thou firm complexion'd bronze, Commissions her. Such misery and woe, As wring the spirit of her hapless lady, Dictate authority to all that's human.â I met the countess flying as I came, Her face distorted, and her fingers spread, And all her figure shrunken, like one sick, Seiz'd with the loathe of some detested drug. FERDINANDO. Good signor Carravagio hear my reason.â This is a matter that involves us all; Or you, who trespass on untimely hours; Or wise Teresa here, who serves the countess; Or I, whom accident brought home so late; Must first sustain the charge of this great wrong. It is not fit that we should meddle in't.â We are not well in circumstances suited. Each may some truth know in a different way, And that which each of us apart suspects, May be as different as we are ourselves. Wait till the count return; then let us speak. Teresa's fancy runs on midnight rape; And you, sir, think, perchance, of robbery; While I who found the door unbarr'd and entered.â CARRAVAGIO. Went you into your lady's room last night? TERESA. He did, he did, good signor Carravagio! FERDINANDO. Do I deny?â CARRAVAGIO. Horrible satyr! cease. The midnight vision of thee in her chamber, Had been enough to redden ruby-red, The diamond purity of such a mind. Oh! noble lady, virtuous in vain! FERDINANDO. Did I not say that he would turn on me? TERESA. If he be false, how shall the true be known? If thou art true, what shape takes villany? FERDINANDO. Think you, or you Teresa, or your dame, To daunt me down by this conspiracy? It is not, sir, in nature credible, That a poor menial should unwelcom'd climb, And love licentious where he dar'd not look. Guard well yourself good signor Carravagio; We know your practice at the midnight hour. SCENE IX. Carravagio and Teresa. CARRAVAGIO. Let us, Teresa, summon up the house; Send for the count, and, with some speedy justice, Avenge this matchless sacrilegious sin. TERESA. As yet my lady, sir, has not complain'd: 'Tis true we have her tears and sorrow seen; But still we know not well what has been done;â She may be vex'd and yet not greatly rue. CARRAVAGIO. You do her wrong, you do her wrong, Teresa. To such a lofty and majestic mind, The very utt'rance of her direful taint, Will be as when the soul forsakes the frame. TERESA. See where she comes! CARRAVAGIO. How solemn and august! Like Juno stepping from the throne of Jove. SCENE X. Antonia, Carravagio, and Teresa. ANTONIA. Good Carravagio, by your leave a moment,â I would converse with her a little space. I pray you, Carravagio, for the day To take command of this ill-fated mansion. Place special sentinels at all the gates: Men you can trust. Look well I pray you, signor, That no one fly; nor least of all that fiendâ See Carravagio, Ferdinando fly not. And, if you will, send for the count my lordâ Good Carravagio it will be too late. He will be here;âhe will come soon enough! CARRAVAGIO. Alas! alas! SCENE XI. Antonia and Teresa. ANTONIA. Why does he weep, Teresa? TERESA. Sad fears and bodements hang on all our minds, And wilder fancies overcome our thoughts, Than the grim night-mare brings in troubl'd dreams. ANTONIA. Last night, Teresa, as I lay asleep, Methought my noble lord, the Count Urbano, The Count Urbano, my dear wedded lord, Came in unheard, and softly sought my couch; But when I woke before the dawn of day, I was alone, and sinking back in sleep, Dreamt that the devil had usurp'd my breast. The fearful image startled me awake; And, clearing swift the hazy drouze that still Hung like a vapour on my faculties, I had persuasion horrible of things Which have infected me with desp'rate death. TERESA. Oh my dear lady!âOh! alas! alas! ANTONIA. But still bright Hope rose like the hectic bloom, That tints the cheek of a consuming fair; And spite of conscious sense beguil'd my wish, Till I had learnt who had profan'd my room. Then like the flame that burst upon the sight Of wretched Hecuba, when she unclos'd Her window on the final night of Troy, The hideous certainty shone full upon me, And show'd the ruin and the sack atchiev'd. TERESA. Oh devilish serpent that could so invade The hallow'd Eden of your wedded faith!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Carravagio and Teresa. CARRAVAGIO. The priest has left her: I saw him depart; He look'd behind just as he left the gate, And, crossing, heavenward turn'd his eyes and sighed. TERESA. May I go in, and ask her how she does? CARRAVAGIO. No: patient wait, and leave her till she call. 'Tis impious to pass with curious eye, Into the sanctu'ry of hopeless sorrow. TERESA. Have you sent messengers to bring the count? CARRAVAGIO. Not yet, Teresa. TERESA. Heavens! why not yet, When such an hideous outrage has been done? CARRAVAGIO. Peace, peace. What has been done, can he undo? TERESA. But when do you intend to call him home? CARRAVAGIO. Not till the guilty has confession made, To the content of all th'assembled household, That she was innocent, and knew him not; Or till she has decided on her doom. TERESA. What mean you, sir? Has she not told us both That she, to-night, would in the convent lie? CARRAVAGIO. But whether as a nun, or with the dead? TERESA. You chill my blood. She will not slay herself? CARRAVAGIO. She had in thought, before the friar came, An awful enterprize. TERESA. How knew you that? CARRAVAGIO. I saw the index written on her brow. TERESA. We should not, sir, then leave her long alone. CARRAVAGIO. Woman; restrain this eagerness to pry; Nor with thy pert and seamstress pity, vex Her solemn magnanimity. Know'st thou That there are minds of such pure element, That the alloy'd and current of the world, Have little common with them but the name; And hers is of that kind. TERESA. But Ferdinando. How do you mean, sir, to proceed with him? It is not right to leave him ranging free.â CARRAVAGIO. While doubtful of his fate, his mind may change: He is perplext. To his material soul, The tragic issue of his flagrant daring, Is as a new creation. Men like him, Cannot, in their sublimest fancies, guess The moods and motives of superior minds. TERESA. Why lay such stress, sir, upon his confession? Do you believe the countess was to blame? CARRAVAGIO. No, woman, no: I never thought the thought; But fame and reputation stand with her Next in degree to virtue: for the least, The sacrifice of life were cheap to her. Did he confess, and place her honour clear, Her virtue yet might lift her from the soil, And make her shine the opal of the land. TERESA. But where's the need, when we are so convinced, To place such consequence to his confession? We may console her if we tell her so. CARRAVAGIO. We never can.âPray thee think less of us.â Those that but know the palpable of men, And such compose the throng and crowd of life, Judge by the fact, and place all in one class, On whom the law bestows a common name. She has confess'd adult'ry! Who will pause To learn the circumstance, nor class her down With those free wantons, whose lewd highway riots, Have chang'd the brazen of the lawyer's front, To blushing copper in th'examination. But good Teresa, let us quit the theme; My heart is full, and swelling to distress. Alas! how little in this world of things, Are held, the feelings that pervade the heart. All that high honour and bright recompence Which should inspire us, and make sweet our toil, Come by the Alchymy of have and want, In the post obit value of our works! SCENE II. Teresa, Antonia, and Carravagio. TERESA. Signor, the countess comes. ANTONIA. âWell, Carravagio; Have you, in all things, done as I desired? CARRAVAGIO. I have, my honoured lady,âallâ TERESA. But one: He has not yet sent for, my lord, the count. ANTONIA. In that omission, he has judged well.â I thank you, Carravagio: it was wise. TERESA. Nor Ferdinando has he yet arrested. ANTONIA. Teresa, doubtless he considers well.â You may retire apart: when there is need, I will require your presence; but till thenâ Teresa?âGo, and lay prepared for me, The dress of simple white. TERESA. Which, my dear lady? ANTONIA. That which I wore when I became a bride. SCENE III. Antonia and Carravagio. ANTONIA. My worthy friend, why falls this shower of sorrow? What we, afflictions and mischances deem, Are but the movements of that viewless chain, On which, dependant from the throne of Heaven, Hang all inferior and created things. Nought from the vassalage of fate is free, But Virtue: she alone exemption boasts, And in her own allodian grandeur firm, Denies the claims that Chance and Time pretend. What! though this fabric crumble into dust, And with the sentenc'd globe return again Into the elements, and all to nothing; That which is I, shall purified ascend, And with the general vanishing of things, Behold its dross and blemish pass away. But come, 'tis fit we should proceed to trial. Good signor, call the household to attend, And such esteemed and venerated neighbours, As by their testimony, may avouch The high result of what shall come to pass. CARRAVAGIO. It is then meet the culprit should attend. ANTONIA. Undoubtedly. How! think you otherwise? CARRAVAGIO. No, gracious lady; but I feared, the sight Might wake afresh the anguish of your mind. ANTONIA. Good, worthy, Carravagio, that is past; The struggle done and vanquish'd Shame laid low. Who is there fashioned in corporeal form, That I may not with steady eye survey? Yea not the taunt of my own true-lov'd lord In giving credence to the menial's tale, Would disconcert my all-collected mind. CARRAVAGIO. Is it your pleasure that the count should come? ANTONIA. No, spare me thatâI could not bear his grief, Nor part from him without a painful pang.â I pray you, friend, be speedy in this task; For idle time is like a giant's robe, It loads, perplexes, and exhausts the strength. SCENE IV. CARRAVAGIO. She has decided as I thought she would. Alas! alas! but who may dare to thwart The high resolves of such a soul as hers. SCENE V. Teresa and Carravagio. TERESA. Where is the countess gone?âAll is prepar'd. CARRAVAGIO. Attend you here, and what she may require Give without speaking, and with lowly service, Such as befits our mean and abject natures, When call'd to offices of awful issue. TERESA. How is she now? CARRAVAGIO. Magnificent! sublime! Like the archangel on the wall of Heav'n, Who looking down on our sublunar orb, Computes the good and ill of human life, And finds a vast preponderance of ill. SCENE VI. TERESA. Ah me! that one so fair should fall so foul! Betray'd unconsciously. She has resolv'd, To quit the world and pine away a nun: Doom'd by the crime of Fortune to a jail.â SCENE VII. Teresa and Ferdinando. TERESA. Well Ferdinando, this is joyous work; Thou art in truth a special gay gallant. FERDINANDO. To you nor other, will I answer give, Till face to face with witnesses we meet.â So! he has sent to call the neighbours in; And summons up the servants to a show. Ay, let him call and summon as he may; The world shall learn who was, or which, to blame. 'Tis shrewd of him, that I must needs admit, To turn on me and bait me for the scorn. But fraud is fraud; this will not last them longâ The shallow silvering will soon be bare, And all the base and counterfeit reveal'd. TERESA. You then persist still in your innocence? FERDINANDO. I do, and will do, till they shew such proof As hands may touch, and eyes may look upon. I am not made so ductile as they deem. TERESA. Behold the neighbours and the servants come, With tearful eyes and faces full of woe; And Carravagio sadder than them all. SCENE VIII. Carravagio, Teresa, Ferdinando, &amp;c. CARRAVAGIO. Good friends, by order of our noble lady, You are assembl'd for a solemn cause. This house so long, the honour of the land, Renown'd for hospitality and all The liberal virtues that should wait on rank, Has been the scene of a tremendous outrage. Beneath the masque of darkness, in the guise Of wedded Confidence, dire Rape last night Stole in and rifled with opprobrious daring The chaste embraces of our lady's love. Th'infernal robber undetected fled;â But various circumstance, of pointing proof, Has fix'd the guilty charge on Ferdinando. For bearing late commission from our lord He did presumeâOh impious presumption! To slip the door and glide into her room, Unheard, unseen, as she defenceless lay, All in the dark and negligence of sleep. On this great fact the countess builds her chargeâ But lo she comes!âmake wayâapartâdivide. What mighty grandeur in her form dilates Beyond the comprehension of our thoughts! SCENE IX. Antonia, Carravagio, Teresa, Ferdinando, &amp;c. ANTONIA. Have you disclosed to them what has mischanced? CARRAVAGIO. I have performed all to the point commanded; Would you that I should still proceed in it? ANTONIA. It might for delicacy be as wellâ But no: I will myself. My worthy friends, In common wrongs, such as may fall on all, We may entrust the agency of others; And purchas'd advocacy may avail. But in my dire unprecedented case, I should impair my own preserv'd esteem, Preserv'd unspotted in th'unconscious sin, Could I forego my painful vindication, Ferdinando.â FERDINANDO. Madam.â ANTONIA. Do you confess? FERDINANDO. That I did pass into your room, I do; That I know well my lord was wrong'd last night, I also must declare. TERESA. To me he said, That when he entered he believed you knew ANTONIA. When the time comes to ask for your report, Then tell your knowledge.âYes, I know full well That in the world the guilt will so be thought.â Do you confess? FERDINANDO. How! that I did the wrong? CARRAVAGIO. Out with the quibble, sirâout with it all. I see it working in thy alt'ring visage. ANTONIA. Let him proceed.âWhat though he dare pretend That in the crime the blame must rest on me, I but desire confession of the fact. Do you confess?âStill blush you to atone? CARRAVAGIO. Give way, give way, O miserable man! To the contrition that begins to rise. ANTONIA. Turn, turn, O turn thee from thy fatal lapse, And strive to reach the upward tract again. The path of vice lies with inviting slope Down the declivity; and every step Is smoother, easier, lower still and lower, Till nothing from the headlong fall can save. In mercy to thyself confession make. TERESA. The fiercest tortures, penal craft employs, To wrench out secrets from the clenched knave, Will tear the truth from thy obdurate breast. ANTONIA. Patience, Teresa, cherish milder thoughts, And e'en in injury benev'lence own. Benevolence is like the glorious sun, Whose free impartial splendour fosters all: It is the radiance of the human soul, The proof and sign of its celestial birth. All other creatures of corporeal ore, Partake the common qualities of man: Love, hatred, anger, all particular aims! But in this infinite and pure effusion, This only passion of divinity, He grows the rival of the heav'nly God.â Do you confess? FERDINANDO. What is't I should confess?â What is this sin, this robbery, this wrong? Where is the loss? Where is the detriment? When theft is wrought a certain void is left; When malice strikes, a wound or blain appears; Wrong ever comes in manifest effect; But this is fantasy, or falsely charged. ANTONIA. Behold, thou shrewd equivocating fiend, The test thou dar'st desireâ TERESA. Oh! horror! horror! She has stabb'd herself!â ANTONIA. Wilt thou yet confess? TERESA. Help! help!âfly all ye wond'ringâ ANTONIA. Silence, woman; Attend thy duty, and support me here. This is no time for idle exclamation.â I want but yet the pleasure ere I die, To hear him say he uninvited came. But if too rapid, ebb my streaming life, May this dread act, my only sure appeal, Deter the sullying Slander from my fame. TERESA. See how the sheety pale of death appears, On that bright face that tempted thee to sin. ANTONIA. Woman, forbear; nor once again presume To breathe allusion to the fatal theme.â Think you he will confess? CARRAVAGIO. I think he will. ANTONIA. Would he were speedy, for I faint apace. My eyes grow dimâGod bless you, worthy friends. Commend me, signor, to my dearest lord. TERESA. Alas! alas! she dies!â CARRAVAGIO. It is away!â Her pure and heav'nly spirit is away. Oh! it has flown like a poor frighten'd bird, Appealing to the Heavens against the hand That plunder'd ruthlessly its early nest.â Friends, let us quit this theatre of blood, With the sad moral graven on our hearts. One guilty act is parent to a race; And the last born still more detestable, In bent and form than all that did precede. TERESA. What would'st thou with the knife? Its sheath of blood, Wert thou a man of human mould compos'd, Would be like mortal pestilence to thee. CARRAVAGIO. Rouse thee, poor wretch! from thy astonishment; There is no visionary horror here. The fatal steel in thy amazed sight, So dropping rubies is no magic fiction; Nor this fair casket, that so late contained A glorious gem by Heav'ns own master placed, A dreamy show; but all reality.â Tortures await thee.â FERDINANDO. Thus from them I fly. END.</field>
