      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDY OF NERO,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Astus Primus. Enter Petronius, Arbyter, Antonius, Honoratus. Petronius. Tvsh, take the wench I showed thee now, or else some other seeke; What? can your choler no way be allayed? But with Imperiall tytles? Will you more tytles vnto CÃ¦sar giue? Anto. Great are thy fortunes Nero, great thy power, Thy Empyre lymited with natures bounds; Vpon thy ground, the Sunne doth set, and ryse; The day, and night are thine: Nor can the Planets, wander where they will: See that proud Earth, that feares not CÃ¦sars name. Yet nothing of all this, I enuy thee; But her, to whom the world, vnforst, obayes, Whose eyes more worth then all it lookes vpon: In whom, all beautyes Nature hath enclos'd, That through the wide Earth, or Heauen are dispos'd Petro. Indeed the steales, and robs each part o'th world, With borrowed beauties to enflame thine eye; The Sea, to fetch her Pearle, is diu'd into: The Diomond rocks are cut, to make her shine: To plume her pryde, the Birds doe naked sing When my Enanthe, in a homely gowne. Ant. Homely I faith. Petro. I, homely in her gowne, But looke vpon her face, and that's set out With no small grace, no vayled shadowes helpe; Foole; that hadst rather with false lights and darke Beguiled be, then see the ware thou buyest. Poppea royally attended, and passe ouer the Stage, in State. Ant. Great Queene, whom nature made to be her glory: Fortune got eies, and came to be thy seruant, Honour is proud to be thy tytle; Though Thy beauties doe draw vp my soule; yet still, So bright, so glorious is thy Maiestie, That it beates downe againe my clyming thoughts. Petro. Why true; And other of thy blindnesses thou seest, Such one to loue thou dar'st not speake vnto. Giue me a wench, that will be easily had, Not woed with cost; And, being sent for, comes, And when I haue her foulded in mine armes, Then Cleopatra she, or Lucres is: Ile giue her any tytle. Anto. Yet not so much her greatnesse, and estate My hopes disharten, as her chastitie. Pet. Chastitie, foole! a word not knowne in Courts: Well may it lodge in meane, and countrey homes, Where pouertie, and labour keepes them downe, Short sleepes, and hands made hard with Thuscan Woll. But neuer comes to great mens Pallaces, Where ease, and riches, stirring thoughts beget, Prouoking meates, and surfet wines Inflame: Where all there setting forth's but to be wooed, And wooed they would not be, but to be wonne. Will one man serue Poppea? Nay, thou shalt Make her, as soone, contented with an eye. Nimphidius to them. Nim. Whil'st Nero, in the streetes, his Pageants shewes, I, to his faire wiues chamber, sent for am. You gracious Starres, that smiled in my birth, And thou bright starre more powerfull then them all, Whose fauouring smyles haue made me what I am Thou shalt my God, my Fate, and fortune bee. Ex. Nim. Ant. How sausely yon fellow. Enters the Empresse chamber. Pet. I, and her too? Antonius knowest thou him? Ant. What? knowes the onely fauorite of the Court? Indeed, not many dayes agoe thou mightest, Haue not vnlawfully askt that question. Pet. Why? Is he rais'd? Ant. That haue I sought in him, But neuer peece of good desert could find: Hee is Nimphidias sonne, the free'd woman, Which basenesse to shake off, he nothing hath But his owne pride Pet. You Remember, when Gallus, Celsus, And others too, though now forgotten were Great in Poppeas eyes. Ant. I doe, and did enterpret it in them An honorable fauor, she bare vertue, Or parts like vertue. Pet. The cause is one of theirs, and this mans grace, I once was great in wauering smiles of Court, I fell because I knew: Sence haue I giuen My time to my owne pleasures, and would now Aduise thee too, to meane, and safe delights: The thigh's as soft the sheepes backe couereth As that which crimson, and with Gold adorn'd: Yet cause I see, that thy restraind desires. Cannot their owne way choose, come thou with me Perhapps Ile shew thee meanes of remedie. Exeunt. Two Romans at seuerall dores. 1 Rom. Whither so fast man? whither so fast? 2 Rom. Whither? but where your eares doe lead you; To Neros Triumphs, and the shouts you heare. 1 Ro. Why? comes he crown'd with Parthian ouerthrow. And brings he UolegÃ¦sus with him, chai'nd? 2 Ro. Parthian ouerthrowne? why, he comes crownd For victories which neuer Roman wonne; For hauing Greece in her owne arts ouerthrowne; In Singing, Dauncing, Horse-rase, Stage-playing. Neuer, O Rome had neuer such a Prince. 1 Rom. Yet, I haue heard: our ancestors were crown'd For other Victories. 2 Rom. None of our ancestors, were ere like him. Within Nero, Apollo, Nero, Hercules. 1 Rom. Harke, how th'applauding shouts doe cleare th'ayre This Idle talke will make me loose the sight. Two Romans more to them. 3 Rom. Whither goe you? alls done i'th Capytall, And Nero, hauing there his tables hung, And Garlands vp: is to the Pallace gone. T'was beyond wonder; I shall neuer see, Nay, I neuer looke, to see the like againe Eighteene hundred and eight Crownes For seuerall victories and the place set downe Where, and in what, and whom he ouercame. 4 Rom. That was set downe it'h tables, that were borne Vpon the Souldiers speares. 1 Rom. O made, and sometimes vse to other ends. 2 Rom. But did he winne them all with singing. 3 Rom. Faith all with singing, and with stage-playing. 1 Rom. So many Crownes got with a song. 4 Rom. But, did you marke the Greeke Musitians Behinde his Chariot, hanging downe their heads? Sham'd, and orecome, in their professions, O Rome was neuer honour'd so, before. 3. Rom. But, what was he that rode 'ith'Chariot with him? 4. Rom. That was Diodorus the Mynstrill, that he fauours. 3. Rom. Was there euer such a Prince. 2. Rom. O Nero Augustus, the true Augustus. 3. Rom. Nay, had you seene him as he rode along, With an Olympicke Crowne vpon his head, And with a Pithian on his arme: you would haue thought, Looking on one he had Apollo seem'd, On th'other Hercules. 2. Rom I haue heard my father oft repeat the Triumphs, Which in Augustus CÃ¦sars tymes were showne, Vpon his Victorie ore the Jllirians; But it seemes it was not like to this. 3, &amp; 4. Rom. Push, it could not be like this. 2, 3, &amp; 4. O Nero, Apollo, Nero, Hercules. Exeunt. 2, 3, &amp; 4. Rom. Alanet Primus. 1. Rom. Whether Augustus Tryumph greater was I cannot tell; his Tryumphs cause I know Was greater farre, and farre more Honourable. What are wee People? or our flattering voyces, That alwayes shame and foolish things applaud Hauing no sparke of Soule; All Eares, and eyes, Pleas'd with vaine showes, deluded by our senses Still enemies to wisedome, and to goodnesse. exit. Enter Nero, Poppea, Nimphidius, Tigellinus, Epaphreditus, Neophitus, and others. Nero, Now fayre Poppea, see thy Nero shine In bright Achaias spoyles, and Rome in him. The Capitall hath other Trophies seene Then it was wont; Not spoyles with blood bedew'd, Or the vnhappie obsequies of Death: But such, as CÃ¦sars cunning, not his force, Hath wrung from Greece; too bragging of her art. Tigell. And in this strife, the glories all your owne, Your Tribunes cannot share this prayse with you; Here, your Centurions hath no part at all, Bootlesse your Armies, and your Eagles were; No Nauies helpt, to bring away this conquest. Nim. Euen Fortunes selfe, Fortune the Queene of kingdomes (That Warrs grim valour graceth with her deeds,) Will claime no portion in this Victorie. Nero. Not Bacchus, drawne from Nisa downe with Tigers, Curbing with viny raines, their wilfull heads, Whil'st some doe gape vpon his Iuy Thirse, Some, on the dangling grapes, that Crowne his head, All praise his beautie, and continuing youth: So strooke, amased India, with wonder As Neroes glories did the Greekish townes Elis, and Pisa, and the rich MicÅnÃ¦, Iunoman Argos, and yet Corinth proud Of her two Seas; all which ore-come, did yeeld To me their praise, and prises of their games. Poppea, Yet, in your Greekish iourney, we do heare, Sparta, and Athens, the two eyes of Greece. Neither beheld your person, nor your skill; Whether, because they did afford no games, Or for their to much grauitie, Nero: Why? what Should I haue seene in them? but in the one, Hunger, blacke-pottage, and men hot to die, Thereby to rid themselues of miserie: And what in th'other? but short Capes, long Beardes, Much wrangling, in things needlesse to be knowne, Wisedome in words, and onely austere faces, I will not be Aiecelaus, nor Solon. Nero was there, where he might honour winn, And honour hath he wonn, and brought from Greece, Those spoyles which neuer Roman could obtaine, Spoyles won by witt, and Tropheis of his skill. Nim. What a thing he makes it to be a Minstrill. Pop. I prayse your witt, my Lord, that choose such safe. Honors, safe spoyles, wonn without dust, or blood. Nero: What, mocke ye me Poppea? Poppea: Nay, in good Faith my Lord, I speake in earnest, I hate that headie, and aduenturous crew, That goe to loose their owne, to purchase, but The breath of others, and the common voyce, Them that will loose there hearing for a sound; That by death onely, seeke to get a liuing, Make skarrs there beautie, and count losse of Limmes The commendation of a proper man, And so, goe halting to immortalitie: Such fooles I loue worse then they doe their liues. Nero: But now Poppea, hauing laid apart Our boastfull spoyles, and ornaments of Tryumph. Come we, like Ioue from PhlegrÃ¦â Poppea: O Giantlike comparison. Nero: When, after all his Fiers, and wandring darts, He comes to bath himselfe, in Iunos Eyes: But thou, (then wrangling Iuno,) farre more fayre, Stayning the euening beauty of the Skie, Or the dayes brightnesse; shall make glad thy CÃ¦sar, Shalt make him proud such beauties to Inioy: Exunt. Manet, Nimphidius solus. Nimph: Such beauties to inioy, were happinesse, And a reward sufficient in it selfe, Although no other end, or hopes were aim'd at: But I haue other; Tis not Poppeas armes, Nor the short pleasures of a wanton bed, That can extinguish mine aspiring thirst To Neroes Crowne; By her loue I must climbe, Her bed is but a step vnto his Throne. Already, wise men laugh at him, and hate him; The people, though his Mynstrelsie doth please them, They feare his Cruelty, hate his exactions, Which, his need, still, must force him to encrease. The multitude, which cannot one thing long Like, or dislike, being cloy'd with vanitie, Will hate their owne delights, though Wisedome doe not, Euen wearinesse, at length, will giue them eyes. Thus, I by Neroes, and Poppeas fauour, Rais'd to the enuious height of second place, May gaine the first: Hate must strike Nero downe. Loue make Nimphidius way vnto a Crowne. exit. Enter Seneca, Sceuinus, Lucan, and Flauius. Sceu. His first beginning was his Fathers death, His brothers poysoning, and wiues bloudy end Came next, his mothers murther clos'd vp all: Yet hitherto he was but wicked, when The guilt of greater euills, tooke away the shame Of lesser, and did headlong thrust him forth, To be the scorne, and laughter to the world; Then first, an Emperour came vpon the Stage, And sung to please Carmen, and Candle-sellers, And learnt to act, to daunce, to be a Fencer, And in despight o'the Maiestie of Princes, He fell to wrastling, and was soyl'd with dust, And tumbled on the Earth with seruile hands. Seneca. He sometimes trayned was in better studies, And had a Child-hood promis'd other hopes; High fortunes, like stronge wines, do trie their vessels. Was not the Race, and Theater bigge enough, To haue inclos'd thy follies heere at home? O could not Rome, and Italie containe Thy shame? but thou must crosse the Seas to shew it? Scen. And make them that had wont to see our Consuls, With conquering Eagles wauing in the field; Instead of that; behold an Emperor dauncing, Playing oth'stage, and what else, but to name Were infamie. Lucan. O Mummius, O Flaminius; You, whom your Vertues haue not made more famous Then Neros vices; You went ore to Greece, But t'other warres, and brought home other conquests. You Corinth, and MicÅna ouerthrew; And Perseus selfe, the Great Achilles race Ore came; hauing Mineruas stayned Temples. And your slayne Ancestors of Troy reueng'd Senec. They stroue with Kings; and kinglike aduersaries. Were euen in their Enemies made happie; The Macedonian Courage tryed of old, And the new greatnesse of the Syrian power: But he for Phillip, and Antiochus, Hath found more easie enemies to deale with, Turpuus, Pammenes, and a rout of Fidlers. Sceuin: Why all the begging Mynstrills by the way, He tooke along with him, and forc'd to striue That he might ouercome, Imagining Himselfe Imortall, by such victories. Flaui: The Men he caried ouer were enough T'haue put the Parthian to his second flight Or the proud Indyan, taught the Roman Yoke. Sceuin: But they were Neroes men, like Nero arm'd With Luts, and Harpes, and Pipes, and Fiddle-cases: Souldyers to, th shadow traynd, and not the field. Flaui: Therefore they brought spoyles of such Soldyers worthy. Luca: But to throw downe the walls, and Gates of Rome, To make an entrance for an Hobby-horse; To vaunt toth'people his rediculous spoyles; To come with Lawrell, and with Olyues crown'd, For hauing beene the worst of all the Singers, Is beyond Patience; Sceuin: I and anger too, Had you but seene him in his Chariot ryde. That Chariot in which, Augustus late His Triumphs ore'so many Nations shew'd, And with him in the same a Minstrell plac'd, The whil'st the people, running by his side, Hayle thou Olimpick Conqueror did crye, O haile thou Pithian, and did fill the skie With shame, and voyces, Heauen would not haue heard. Senec: I saw't, but turn'd away my Eyes, and Eares, Angry, they should be priuie to such sights. Why doe I stand relating of the storie, Which in the doing had enough to grieue me? Tell on, and end the tale, you, whom it pleaseth; Mee mine owne sorrow stops from further speaking. Nero, my loue doth make thy fault, and my griefe greater. (ex. Se. Sceuin: I doe commend in Seneca this passion; And yet me thinkes our Countries miserie, Doth at our hands craue somewhat more then teares. Luca: Pittie, though't doth akind affection show, (If it end there) our weakenesse makes vs know. Flaui: Let children weepe, and men seeke remedie, Sceui: Stoutly, and like a Souldier, Flauius: Yet, to seeke remedie to a Princes ill, Seldome, but it doth the Phisitian kill. Flaui: And if it doe Sceuinus, it shall take But a deuoted soule from Flauius, Which, to my Countrey, and the Gods of Rome, Alreadie sacred is, and giuen away, Death is no stranger vnto me, I haue The doubtfull hazard in twelue Battailes throwne, My chaunce was life. Luca: Why doe we goe to fight in Brittanie? And end our liues vnder an other Sunne? Seeke causelesse dangers out? The German might Enioy his Woods, and his owne Allis drinke, Yet we walke safely in the streets of Rome: Bodinca hinders not, but we might liue, Whom, we doe hurt; Them we call enemies, And those our Lords that spoyle, and murder vs. Sceuin: Nothing is hard to them that dare to die. This Noble resolution in you Lords, Heartens me to disclose some thoughts that Iâ The matter is of waight and dangerous. Luca: I see you feare vs Seruinus. Sceuin: Nay, Nay, although the thing be full of feare. Flaui: Tell it to faithfull Eares, what eare it bee. Sceuin: Faith let it goe, it will but trouble vs, Bee hurtfull to the speaker, and the hearer. Luca: If our long friendship, or the opinion. Sceuin: Why should I feare to tell them? Why is he not a Parricide, a Player? Nay Lucan is he not thine Enemie? Hate not the Heauens, as well, as men, to see That condem'd head: and you O righteous Gods Whither so ere you now are fled, and will No more looke downe vpon th'oppressed Earth; O seuere anger of the highest Gods, And thou sterne power, to whom the Greekes assigne Scourges, and swords to punish proud mens wrongs, If you be more then names found out to awe vs, And that we doe not vainely build you alters, Aid that iust arme, that's bent to execute What you should doe. Luca. Stay, y'are caried too much away Sceuinus. Sceui. Why, what will you say for him? hath he not Sought to suppresse your Poem, to bereaue That honour euery tongue in duty paid it. Nay, what can you say for him, hath he not Broa'cht his owne wiues (a chast wiues) breast, and torne With Scithian hands his Mothers bowels vp, The Inhospitable Caucasus is milde: The More, that, in the boyling desert, seekes With blood of stranger to imbrue his iawes Vpbraides the Roman, now with barbarousnesse Luca: You are to earnest, I neither can, nor will I speake for him: And, though he sought my learned paynes to wrong, I hate him not for that, My verse shall liue When Neroes body shall be throwne in Tiber, And times to come shall blesse those wicked armes; I loue th'vnnaturall wounds, from whence did flow Another Ciria, a new Hellicon. I hate him that he is Romes enemie, An enemie to Vertue; sits on high To shame the seate; And in that hate, my life, And blood, Ile mingle on the earth with yours. Flaui: My deeds Sceuinus shall speake my consent. Sceui. Tis answerd, as I lookt for, noble Poet, Worthy the double Lawrell; Flauius, Good lucke I see, doth vertuous meanings ayde, And therefore haue the Heauens forborne their duties, To grace our swords with glorious blood of Tyrants. exeunt.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Petronius Solus. Here waites Poppea her Nimphidius comming, And hath this garden, and these walkes chose out, To blesse her with more pleasures then their owne: Not onely Arras hangings, and silke beeds Are guilty of the faults we blame them for: Somewhat these Arbors, and you trees doe know, Whil'st your kind shades, you to these night sports show. Night sports? Faith, they are done in open day, And the Sunne see'th, and enuieth their play. Hither haue I Loue-sicke Antonius brought, And thrust him on occasion so long sought: Shewed him the Empresse in a thicket by, Her loues approach waiting with greedie Eye; And told him, if he euer meant to proue, The doubtfull issue of his hopelesse Loue; This is the place, and time wherein to try it, Women will heere the suite, that will deny it. The suit's not hard, that she comes for to take; Who (hott in lust of men) doth difference make? At last, loath, willing, to her did he pace; Arme him Priapus, with thy powerfull Mace. But see, they comming are; how they agree Heere will I harken, shroud me gentle tree. Enter Poppea and Antonius. Anto. Seeke not to grieue that heart which is thine owne, In Loues sweete fires, let heat of rage burne out; These browes could neuer yet to wrinckle learne, Nor anger out of such faire eyes looke forth. Poppea: You may solicite your presumptuous suites; You duety may, and shame too layd aside, Disturbe my priuacies, and I forsooth, Must be afeard euen to be angry at you. Anto: What shame is't to be mastred by such beautie? Who, but to serue you, comes, how wants he dutie? Or if it be a shame, the shame is yours; The fault is onely in your Eies, they drew me; Cause you were louely, therefore did I loue: O, if to Loue you, anger you so much, You should not haue such cheekes, nor lips to touch, You should not haue your snow, nor currall spy'd; If you but looke on vs, in vaine you chide, We must not see your Face, nor heare your speech: Now, whilst you Loue forbid, you Loue doe teach. Pet. He doth better then I thought he would. Pop: I will not learne my beauties worth of you, I know you neither are the first, nor greatest Whom it hath mou'd: He whom the World obayes Is fear'd with anger of my threatning Eyes. It is for you a farre off to adore it, And not to reach at it with sawsie hands. Feare, is the Loue that's due to Gods, and Princes Pet. All this is but to edge his appetite. Ant. O doe not see thy faire in that false glasse Of outward difference; Looke into my heart, There, shalt thou see thy selfe, Inthroaned set In greater Maiesty, then all the pompe Of Rome, or Nero; Tis not the crowching awe, And Ceremony, with which we flatter Princes, That can to Loues true duties be compar'd. Pop: Sir, let me goe, or Ile make knowne your Loue To them, that shall requite it, but with hate. Pet. On, on, thou hast the goale, the fort is beaten, Women are wonne when they begin to threaten. Anto. Your Noblenesse doth warrant me from that, Nor need you others helpe, to punish me, Who, by your forehead am condem'd, or free. They, that to be reuendg'd do bend their minde, Seeke alwayes recompence, in that same kind The wrong was done them; Loue was mine offence, In that reuenge, in that seeke recompence. Popp. Further to auswere, will still cause replyes, And those as ill doe please me, as your selfe: If you'le an answere take, that's breefe, and true, I hate my selfe, If I be lou'd of you. exit Popp. Petro. What gone? but she will come againe sure, no; It passeth cleane my cunning, all my rules; For Womens wantonnesse there is no rule. To take her, in the itching of her Lust, A propper young-man putting forth himselfe? Why Fate; There's Fate and hidden prouidence In codpiece matters. Anto: O vnhappie Man, What comfort haue I now Petronius? Pet. Counsell your selfe, Ile teach no more but learne. Ant. This comfort yet; He shall not so escape, Who causeth my disgrace, Nimphidius Whom had I here.âWell, For my true-hearts loue I see she hates me; And shall I loue one That hates me; and bestowes what I deserue Vpon my riuall? no, Farewell Poppea, Farewell Poppea, and farewell all Loue; Yet thus much shall it still preuaile in me, That I will hate Nimphidius for thee: Pet. Farewell to her, to my Enanthe welcome, Who, now, will to my burning kisses stoope, Now, with an easie cruelty deny, That, which she, rather then the asker, would Haue forced from her, then begins her selfe. Their loues, that list vpon great Ladies set; I still will loue the Wench that I can get. Exeunt. Enter Nero, Tigellinus, Epaphroditus and Neophilus. Nero: Tigellinus, said the villaine Proculus I was throwne downe in running? Tigel: My Lord, he said that you were crown'd for that You could not doe. Nero, For that I could not doe? Why, Elis saw me doe't, and doe't with wonder Of all the Iudges, and the lookers on: And yet, to see, A villane? could not doe't? Who did it better? I warrant you he said I from the Chariot fell against my will. Tigil: He said my Lord, you were throwne out of it, All crusht, and maim'd, and almost bruis'd to death. Nero, Malicious Rogue, when I fell willingly, To show of purpose, with what little hurt Might a good rider beare a forced fall. How sayest thou? Tigillinus, I am sure Thou hast in driuing as much skill as he. Tigil: My Lord, you greater cunning shew'd in falling, Then had you sate, Nero, I know I did; or bruised in my fall? Hurt! I protest I felt no griefe in it. Goe Tigillinus, fetch the villaines head, This makes me see his heart in other things? Fetch me his head, he nere shall speake againe. ex. Tigil. What doe we Princes differ, from the durt, And basenesse of the common Multitude, If to the scorne of each malicious tongue We subiect are: For that I had no skill; Not he, that his farre famed daughter set A prise to victorie, and had bin crown'd With thirteene Sutors deaths, till he at length By fate of Gods, and seruants treason fell, (Shoulder pack't Pelops glorying in his spoyles,) Could with more skill his coupled horses guide. Euen as a Barke, that through the moouing Flood. Her linnen wings, and the forc't ayre doe beare, The Byllowes fome, she smoothly cutts them through; So past my burning Axeltree along, The people follow, with their eyes and voyce, And now the wind doth see it selfe outrun, And the Clouds wonder to be left behind; Whilst the void ayre is fild with shoutes and noyse And Neroes name doth beate the brasen Skie, Jubiter enuying, loath doth heare my praise: Then there greene bowes, and Crownes of Oliue wre'aths The Conquerors praise, they giue me as my due, And yet this Rogue sayth, no we haue no skill. Enter a seruant to them. Seruant, My Lord, the Stage, and all the furniture. Nero: I haue no skill to driue a Chariot: Had he but robde me, broke my treasurie, The red-Sea's mine, mine are the Indian stones, The Worlds mine owne, then, cannot I be robde? But spightfully, to vndermine my fame, To take away my arte; he would my life As well, no doubt; could he tould how. Enter Tegilliuus, with Proculus head. Neoph: My Lord, Tegillinus is backe come with Proculus head Nero, O cry thee mercie good Neophitus; strikes him Giue him fiue hundred sesterces for amends, Hast brought him Tegillinus? Tegil: Heres his head my Lord. Nero, His tongue had bin enough, Tegil: I did as you commanded me my Lord. Nero, Thou toldst not me, though he had such a Nose. Now are you quiet, and haue quieted me; This tis to be commander of the World, Let them extoll weake pittie that doe neede it, Let meane men cry to haue Law, and Iustice done And tell their griefes to Heauen, that heares them not Kings must vpon the Peoples headlesse courses Walke to securitie, and ease of minde. Why what haue we to doe with th'ayrie names (That old age, and Philosophers found out,) Of Iustice, and ne're certaine Equitie; The Gods reuenge themselues, and so will we; Where right is scand, Authoritie'is orethrowne, We haue a high prerogatiue aboue it; Slaues may doe what is lust, we, what we please, The people will repine, and thinke it ill, But they must beare, and prayse too, what we will. Enter Cornutus to them. Neoph: My Lord, Cornutus whom you sent for's come. Nero, Welcome good Cornutus Are all thigs ready for the Stage, As I gaue charge. Corn: They onely stay your comming. Nero, Cornutus, I must act to day Orestus. Cornu: You haue done that alreadie; and too truelyâ aside Nero, And when our Sceane is done, I meane besides To read some compositions of mine owne, Which for the great opinion I my selfe, And Rome In generall, of thy Iudgement, hath, Before I publish them, Ile shew them thee. Cornu: My Lord, my disabilities Nero: I know thy modestie, Ile onely shew thee, now, my works beginning: Goe see Epaphroditus, Musick made ready, I will sing to day. Exit Epa. Cornutus I pray thee, come neere, And let me heare thy Iudgement in my paynes; I would haue thee more familiar good Cornutus, Nero doth prise desert, and more esteemes Them, that in knowledge second him then power, Marke with what style, and state my worke begins. Cornu: Might not my Interuption offend Whats your workes name my Lord, what write you of? Nero, I meane to write the deeds of all the Romans Cornu: Of all the Romans? a huge argument Nero, I haue not yet bethought me of a Title You Enthrall Powers which the wide Fortunes doome he reade; Of Empyre crown'd, seauen Mountaine-seated Rome Full blowne; Inspire me with MachlÃ¦an rage, That J may bellow out Romes Prentisage, As when the Menades doe fill their Drums And crooked hornes with Mimalonean humme: And Ennion doe Ingeminate a round Which reparable Ecchoe doth resound. How doest thou like our Muses paines Cornutus. Cornu: The verses haue more in them, then I see; Your worke my Lord I doubt will be too long. Nero, Too long? Tigel: Too long? Cornu: I, If you write the deedes of all the Romans How many Bookes thinke you t'include it in? Nero, I thinke to write about foure hundred Bookes. Cornu: Foure hundred? why my Lord the'yle nere be read. Nero, Hah? Tigil: Why he, whom you esteeme so much Crisippus, Wrote many more. Cornu: But they were profitable to common life And did Men, Honestie, and Wisedome teach. Nero: Tigillinus? Exit Nero &amp; Tigeli. Cornu: See with what earnestnesse he crau'd my Iudgment, And now he freely hath it, how it likes him? Neoph: The Prince is angry, and his fall is neere; Let vs begon, least we partake his ruines. Exeunt omnes prÃ¦ter Cornu. Manet Cornutus solus. What should I doe at Court? I cannot lye; Why didst thou call me, Nero, from my Booke? Didst thou for flatterie of Cornutus looke? No, let those purple Fellowes that stand by thee, (That admire shew, and things that thou canst giue, Leaue to please Truth, and Vertue, to please thee. Nero, there's nothing in thy power, Cornutus Doth wish or feare. Enter Tigellinus to him. Tigel: Tis Neroes pleasure that you straight depart To GiarÃ¦, and there remaine confin'd: Thus he, out of his Princely Clemencie, Hath Death, your due, turn'd but to banishment. Cornu: Why Tigellinus? Tigel: I haue done, vpon your perill goe, or stay, ex Ti. Cornu: And why should Death? or Banishment be due? For speaking, that which was requir'd, my thought; O why doe Princes loue to be deceiu'd? And, euen, doe force abuses on themselues? There Eares are so with pleasing speech beguil'd, That Truth they mallice, Flatterie, truth account, And their owne Soule, and vnderstanding lost, Goe (what they are) to seeke in other men. Alas, weake Prince, how hast thou punisht me, To banish me from thee? O let me goe And dwell in Taurus, dwell in Ethiope, So that I doe not dwell at Rome, with thee. The farther, still, I goe from hence, I know, The farther I leaue Shame and Vice behind. Where can I goe, but I shall see thee, Sunne? And Heauen will be as neere me, still, as here. Can they, so farre, a knowing soule exyle, That her owne roofe she sees not ore her head? Exit. Enter Piso, Sceuinus, Lucan, Flauius. Piso, Noble Gentlemen, what thankes, what recompence Shall hee giue you, that giue to him the world; One life to them, that must so many venture, And that, the worst of all, is too meane paye; Yet can I giue no more; Take that, bestow it Vpon your seruice. Lucan: O Piso, that vouchsafest, To grace our headlesse partie with thy name; Whom, hauing our conductors, we need not Haue fear'd to goe again the well try'd vallor Of Iulius, or stayednesse of Augustus, Much lesse the shame, and Womanhood of Nero; When we had once, giuen out, that our pretences Were all for thee, our end, to make thee Prince, They thronging came to giue their names, Men, Women, Gentlemen, People, Soldiers, Senators, The Campe, and Cittie, grew asham'd that Nero, And Piso should be offered them together. Sceu. We seeke not now (as in the happy dayes O'th common wealth they did, for libertie; O you, deere ashes, Cassius and Brutus That was with you entomb'd, there let it rest, We are contented with the galling yoke, If they will only leaue vs necks to beare it; We seeke no longer freedome, we seeke life At least, not to be murdred, let vs die On Enemies swords; Shall we, whom neither The Median Bow, nor Macedonian Speare Nor the firce Gaule, nor painted Briton could Subdue, lay downe our neckes to Tyrants axe? Why doe we talke of Vertue, that obay Weakenesse, and Vice. Piso: Haue patience good Sceuinus Lucan: Weakenesse, and seruile gouernment we hitherto Obeyed haue, which, that we may no longer, We haue our liues, and fortunes now set vp, And haue our cause with Pisoes credit strengthned. Flaui: Which makes it doubtfull, whether loue to him Or Neroes hatred, hath drawne more vnto vs. Piso: I see the good thoughts you haue of me, Lords. Lets now proceede to th'purpose of our meeting, I pray you take your places. Lets haue some Paper brought Sceuin: Whose within Enter Milichus to them. Meli. My Lord Sceu. Some Inke, and Paper Exit Moli. &amp; enter againe with Incke, and Paper. Flaui: Whose that Sceuinus? Sceui: It is my freed man Melichus. Luca: Is he trustie? Sceuin: I for as great matters, as we are about. Piso: And those are great ones. Luca: I aske not that we meane to neede his trust. Gaine hath great soueragintie ore seruile mindes. Sceui: O but my benifits haue bound him to me. I, from abondman, haue his state not onely Aduanc't to freedome, but to wealth and credit. Piso: Meli. waire ith'next chamber tell we call. abscondit se The thing determinde on our meeting now, Is of the meanes, and place, due circumstance, As to the doing of things t'is requir'd, So done it names the action. Melic: I wonder, What makes this new resort to haunt our house, When wonted Lucius Piso to come hither? Or Lucan, when so oft, as now of late. aside Piso: And since the field, and open shew of armes Dislike you, and that for the generall good, You meane to end all styrres, in end of him: That, as the ground, must first be thought vpon. Melic: Besides, this comming cannot be for forme, Our visitation, they goe aside, aside And haue long conferences by themselues. Luca: Piso, his comming to your house at BaiÃ¦ To bathe, and banquet, will fit meanes afford, amidst his cups, to end his hated life, Let him die drunke, that nere liu'd soberly. Pisa: O be it farre, that I should staine my Table, And Gods of Hospitalitie with blood; Let not our cause (now Innocent) be soyld With such a blot, nor Pisoes name made hatefull. What place can better fit our action Then his owne house? that boundlesse enuied heape, Built with the spoyles, and blood of Cittizens That hath taken vp the Citie, left no roome For Rome to stand on; Romanes get you gone And dwell at UeiÃ¦, If that VeiÃ¦ too This house ore runne not. Lucan. But twill be hard to doe it in his house, And harder to escape being done. Piso. Not so, Rufus the Captaine of the Guard's with vs, And diuers other oth'Pretorian Band Already made; many, though vnacquainted With our intents, haue had disgrace and wrongs, Which grieue them still; most will be glad of change, And euen they that lou'd him best, when once They see him gone, will smile o'th comming times, Let goe things past, and looke to their owne safetie: Besides, th'astonishment and feare will be So great, so sodaine, that 'twill hinder them From doing any thing. Meli. No priuate businesse can concerne them all; aside. Their countenances are troubled, and looke sad, Doubt and Importance in their face is read. Lucan. Yet still I thinke it were Safer t'attempt him priuate, and alone. Flaui. But 'twill not carry that opinion with it, Twill seeme more foule, and come from priuate malice. Brutus, and they, to right the common cause, Did chuse a publike place. Serui. Our deed is honest, why should it seeke corners? Tis for the people done, let them behold it; Let me haue them a witnesse of my truth, And loue toth'Common-wealth; The danger's greater, So is the glory. Why should our pale counsels Tend whether feare, rather then vertue calls them: I doe not like these cold considerings; First, let our thoughts looke vp to what is honest, Next, to what's safe; If danger may deterre vs, Nothing that's great, or good shall ere be done; And, when we first gaue hands vpon this deed Toth'commons safetie, we our owne gaue vp. Let no man venture on a princes death, How bad soeuer, with beliefe to escape; Dispaire must be our hope, fame, or reward. To make the generall liking to concurre With others, were euen to strike him in his shame, Or (as he thinks) his glory, on the Stage, And so too truely make't a Tragedy; When all the people cannot chuse but clap So sweet a close, and 'twill not CÃ¦sar be That shall be slaine, a Romane Prince: Twill be AlcmÃ¦on, or blind Oedipus. Meli. And if it be of publique matters, 'tis not aside. Like to be talke, or idle fault finding, On which the coward onely spends his wisedome: These are all men of action, and of spirit, And dare performe what they determine on. Luca. What thinke you of Poppea, Tigellinus. And tho'ther odious Instruments of Court: Were it not best at once to rid them all? Serui. In CÃ¦sars ruine, Anthony was spared: Lets not our cause with needlesse blood distaine, One onely mou'd, the change will not appeare When too much licence giuen to the sword, Though against ill, will make euen good men feare: Besides, things setled, you at pleasure may By Law, and publique Iudgement haue them rid. Meli. And if it be but talke oth'State, 'tis Treason, Like it they cannot, that they cannot doe: If seeke to mend it, and remooue the Prince, That's highest Treason; change his Councellours, aside. That's alteration of the gouernment, The common cloke that Treasons mufled in; If laying force aside, to seeke by suite, And faire petition, t'haue the State reform'd, That's tutering of the Prince, and takes away, Thone his person, this his Soueraigntie; Barely in priuate talke to shew dislike Of what is done, is dangerous; therefore the action Mislike you, cause the doer likes you not? Men are not fit to liue ith state they hate. Piso. Though we would all haue that imployment sought, Yet, since your worthy forwardnesse, Seruinus, Preuents vs, And so Nobly beggs for danger: Be this the chosen hand to doe the deed, The fortune of the Empire speed your sword. Sceui: Vertue, and Heauen speed it; O you homeborne Gods of our countrey, Romulus, and Vesta, That Thuscan Tiber, and Romes towers defends: Forbid not yet at length a happie end To former euils; Let this hand reuenge The wronged world; enough we now haue suffered. exeunt. Manet Melichus solus. Meli. Tush, all this long Consulting's more then words, It ends not there; th'haue some attempt, some plot, Against the state: well, Ile obserue it farther, And if I find it, make my profit of it. exeunt.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Enter Poppea Solus. Poppea: I lookt Nimphidius would haue come ere this, Makes he no greater hast to our embraces? Or, doth the easines abate his edge? Or, seeme we not as faire still as we did? Or, is he so with Neroes playing wonne, That he, before Poppea, doth preferre it? Or doth he thinke to haue occasion still? Sill, to haue time to waite on our stolne meetings? Enter Nimphidius to her. Poppe: But see his presence now doth end those doubts. What i'st Nimphidius hath so long detain'd you? Nimph: Faith Lady, causes strong enough, High walls, bard dores, and guards of armed men. Poppe: Were you Imprisoned, then, as you were going To the Theater. Nimphi: Not in my going Lady, But, in the Theater, I was Imprisoned: For, after he was once vpon the Stage, The Gates were more seuerely lookt into Then at a towne besieg'd; No man, no cause Was Currant, no, nor passant; At other sights The striefe is only to get in, but here The stirre was all, in getting out againe; Had, we not bin kept to it so, I thinke T'would nere haue bin so tedious, though I know, 'Twas hard to iudge, whether his doing of it Were more absur'd, then 'twas for time to doe it. But when we once were forc't to be spectators, compel'd to that, which should haue bin a pleasure We could no longer beare the wearisomnesse: No paine so irkesome, as a forc't delight; Some fell downe dead, or seem'd at least to doe so, Vnder that colour, to be carried forth, Then death first pleasur'd men, the shape all feare Was put on gladly, some clombe ore the walls, And so, by falling caught in earnest that, Which th'other did dissemble; There were women, (That being not able to intreat the guard To let them passe the gates,) were brought to bedde Amid'st the throngs of men, and made Lucina Blush, to see that vnwonted companie. Poppe: If'twere so straightly kept, how got you forth? Nimp: Faith Lady I came, pretending hast In Face and Countenance, told them I was sent For things, bith' Prince forgot about the sceane, Which, both my credit made them to beleeue, And Nero, newly whispered me before. Thus did I passe the gates, the danger Ladie I haue not yet escap't. Poppe: What danger meane you? Nim: The danger of his anger, when he knowes How I thus shrunke away, for there stood knaues That put downe in their Tables all that stir'd, And markt in each there cheerefulnesse, or sadnesse. Poppe: I warrant Ile excuse you: But I pray, Lett's be a little better for your sight; How did our Princely husband act Orestes? Did he not wish againe his Mother liuing? Her death would adde great life vnto his part: But come I pray, the storie of your sight. Nim: O doe not driue me to those hatefull paines; Lady, I was too much in seeing vext, Let it not be redoubled with the telling; I now am well, and heare, my eares set free; O be mercifull, doe not bring me backe Vnto my prison, at least free your selfe, It will not passe away, but stay the time; Wracke out the houres in length; O giue me leaue, as one that wearied with the toyle at sea, And now on wished shore hath firm'd his foote; He lookes about, and glads his thoughts and eyes, With sight oth'greene cloath'd ground, and leauy trees, Of flowers that begge more then the looking on, And likes these other waters narrow shores; So let me lay my wearines in these armes, Nothing but kisses to this mouth discourse, My thought be compast in those circl'd Eyes; Eyes on no obiect looke, but on those Cheekes; Be blest my hands with touch of those round brests, Whiter and softer then the downe of Swans. Let me of thee, and of thy beauties glory, And endlesse tell, but neuer wearying story. Exeunt. Enter Nero, Ephaproditus, Neophilus. Nero: Come Sirs, Ifaith, how did you like my acting? What? wast not as you lookt for? Epaph: Yes my Lord, and much beyond. Nero: Did I not doe it to the life? Epaph: The very doing neuer was so liuely As now this counterfeyting. Nero: And when I came, Toth'point of Agrippa, Clitemnestras death, Did it not mooue the feeling auditory? Epaph: They had beene stones, whom that could not haue mou'd. Nero: Did not my voyce hold out well to the end? And seru'd me afterwards afresh to sing with. Neoph: We know Apollo cannot match your voyce. Epaph: By Ioue, I thinke you are the God himselfe Come from aboue, to shew your hidden arts; And fill vs men with wonder of your skill. Nero: Nay faith speake truely, doe not flatter me; I know you need not: flattery's but where Desert is meane. Epaph: I sweare by thee O CÃ¦sar; Then whom no power of Heauen I honour more, No mortall voice can passe, or equall thine. Nero: They tell of Orpheus, when he tooke his Lute, And moou'd the noble Iuory with his touch: Hebrus stood still, Pangea bow'd his head, Ossa then first shooke off his snowe, and came To listen to the moouings of his song; The gentle Popler, tooke the Oake along, And call'd the Pyne downe, from his Mountaine seate; The Virgine Bay, although the Arts she hates Oth'Delphick God, was with his voice ore come, He his twice-lost Euridice bewailes, And Proserpines vaine gifts, and makes the shores And hollow caues of forrests now vntreed Beare his griefe company, and all things teacheth His lost loues name: Then water, ayre, and ground Euridice, Euridice, resound. These are bould tales, of which the Greekes haue store; But if he could from Hell once more returne, And would compare his hand and voice with mine, I, though himselfe were iudge, he then should see, How much the Latine staines the Thracian lyar. I oft haue walkt by Tibers flowing bankes, And heard the Swan sing her owne Epitaph When she heard me, she held her peace and died. Let others raise from earthly things their praise, Heauen hath stood still to heare my happy ayres And ceast th'eternall Musicke of the Spheares To marke my voyce and mend their tunes by mine. Neoph: O diuine voyce, Epaph: Happy are they that heare it. Enter Tigellinus to them. Nero: But here comes Tigellinus, come, thy bill, Are there so many; I see I haue enemies. Epaph: Haue you put Caius in, I saw him frowne Neoph: And, in the midst oth'Emperors act on Gallus laught out, and as I thinke in scorne. Nero: Vespasian too a sleepe; was he so drowsie? Well, he shall sleepe the Iron sleepe of death And did Thrasea looke so sourely on vs? Tigil: He neuer smilde, my Lord, nor would vouchsafe With one applause to grace your action. Nero: Our action needed not be grac'd by him, Hee's our old enemie, and still Malignes vs; T'will haue an end, nay it shall haue an end. Why, I haue bin too pittifull too remisse, My easinesse is laught at, and contemn'd, But I will change it; Not, as heretofore, By singling out them, one by one to death, Each common man can such reuenges haue; A Princes anger must lay desolate Citties, Kingdomes consume, Roote vp mankind. O could I liue to see the generall end, Behold the world enwrapt in funerall flame, When, as the Sunne shall lend his beames to burne What he before brought forth, and water serue, Not to extinguish, but to nurse the fire: Then, like the Salamander, bathing me In the last Ashes of all mortall things Let me giue vp this breath; Priam was happie, Happie indeed he saw his Troy burnt, And Illion lye on heapes; Whil'st thy pure streames, (Diuine Scamander) did run Phrygian blood And heard the pleasant cries of Troian Mothers. Could I see Rome, so! Tigell: Your Maiestie may easily, Without this trouble to your sacred mind. Nero: What may I easily doe? kill thee, or him, How may I rid you all? where is the Man That will all others end, and last himselfe? O that I had thy Thunder in my hand, Thou idle Rouer, Ile not shoote at trees, And spend in woods my vnregarded vengeance, Ile sheuire them downe vpon thtir guilty roofes, And fill the streetes with bloody burials. But 'tis not Heauen can giue me what I seeke; To you, you hated kingdomes of the night, You severe powers, that not like those aboue, Will with faire words, or childrens cryes be wonne, That haue a stile beyond that Heauen is proud off, Deriuing not from Art a makers Name, But in destruction power, and terror shew: To you I flye for succour: you, whose dwellings For torments are bely'de, must giue me ease; Furies, lend me your fires, no they are here, They must be other fires; materiall brands That must the burning of my heat allay; I bring to you no rude vnpractiz'd hands, Already doe they reeke with mothers blood: Tush that's but innocents, to what now I meane, Alasse what euell could those yeeres commit, The world in this shall see my setled wit. exeunt. Enter Seneca, Petronius. Senec: Petroneus, you were at the Theater. Petron: Senica I was, and saw your kingly Pupyll In Mynstrils habit, stand before the Iudges, Bowing those hands, which the worlds Scepter hold, And with great awe and reuerence beseeching Indifferent hearing, and an equall doome: Then CÃ¦sar doubted first to be oreborne, And so he ioyn'd himselfe to th'other singers, And straightly all other Lawes oth'Stage obseru'd, As not (though weary) to sit downe, not spit; Not wipe his sweat off, but with what he wore; Meanetime how would he eye his aduersaries, How he would seeke t'haue all they did disgrac't, Traduce them priuily, openly raile at them: And them he could not conquer so, he would Corrupt with money, to doe worse then he. This was his singing part, his acting now. Senec: Nay euen end here, for I haue heard enough, I haue a Fidler heard him, let me not See him a Player, nor the fearefull voyce Of Romes great Monarch, now command in Iest Our Prince be Ãgamemnon in a Play. Petron: Why Seneca, Tis better in Play Be Ãgamemnon, then himselfe indeed; How oft, with danger of the field beset, Or with home mutineys, would he vnbee Himselfe, or, ouer cruell alters weeping, Wish, that with putting off a vizard, hee Might his true inward sorrow lay aside; The showes of things are better then themselues: How doth it stirre this ayrye part of vs, To heare our Poets tell imagin'd fights, And the strange blowes, that fained courage giues, When I Achilles heare vpon the Stage Speake Honour, and the greatnesse of his soule; Me thinkes I too, could on a Phrygian Speare Runne boldly, and make tales for after times; But when we come to act it in the deed, Death mares this brauery, and the vgly feares Of th'other world, sit on the proudest browe, And boasting valour looseth his red cheeke. A Romane to them. Rom: Fire, fire, helpe, we burne. 2. Rom: Fire, water, fire helpe fire. Senec: Fire, where? Petron: Where? what fire. Rom: O round about, here, there, on euery side. The girdling flame, doth with vnkind embraces Compasse the Citie. Petro: How came this fire, by whom? Senec: Wast chance, or purpose? Petro: Why is't not quencht? Rom: Alas there are a many there with weapons, Aod whether it be for pray, or by command, They hinder: nay, they throwe on fire-brands. Enter Antonius to them. Anton: The fire encreaseth, and will not be staid, But like a streame that tumbling from a hill, Orewhelmes the fields, orewhelmes the hopefull toyle Oth'husbandman, and headlong beares the woods; The vnweeting Shepheard on a Rocke a farre, Amazed, heares the fearefull noyse; so here, Danger and Terror striue, which shall exceed, Some cry, and yet are well, some are kild silent, Some kindly runne to helpe their neighbours house, The whilest their own's a fire: some saue their goods, And leaue their dearer pledges in the flame; One takes his litle sonnes with trembling hands, Tother his house-Gods saues, which could not him, All bann the doore, and with wishes kill Their absent murderer. Petro: What? are the Gaules returnd? Doth Brenius brandish fire-brands againe. Senec: What can Heauen now vnto our suffrings adde. Enter Another Romane to them. Rom: O all goes downe, Rome falleth from the Roofe, The wind's aloft, the conquering flame turnes all Into it selfe; Nor doe the Gods escape, Pleidds burnes, Iupiter Stator burnes. The Altar now is made a sacrifice; An Vesta mournes, to see her Virgin sires Mingle with prophane ashes. Senec: Heauen, hast thou set this end, to Roman greatnesse? Were the worlds spoyles, for this, to Rome deuided, To make but our fires bigger? You Gods, whose anger made vs great, grant yet Some change in misery; We begge not now, To haue our Consull tread on Asian Kings, Or spurne the quiuerd Susa at their feet; This, we haue had before; we begg to liue, At least not thus to die; Let Cannos come, Let Allius waters turne againe to blood. To these will any miseries be light. Petro: Why with false Auguries haue we bin deceiu'd? Why was our Empire told vs, should endure With Sunne, and Moone, in time; in brightnesse passe them, And that our end should be oth'world, and it. What, can Celestiall Godheads double too? Senec: O Rome, the enuy late, But now, the pitie of the world thee gets, The men of Choleos at thy sufferings griue, The shaggy dweller in the Scithian Rockes; The most condemned to perpetuall snowe That neuer wept at kindreds burials, Suffers with thee, and feeles his heart to soften. O, should the Parthyan heare these miseries, He would, (his low and natiue hate apart) Sit downe with vs. and lend an Enemies teare, To grace the funerall fires of ending Rome. Exeunt. Soft Musique, Enter Nero aboue alone with a Timbrell. I, now my Troy lookes beautious in her flames, The Trirhnen Seas are bright with Roman fires, Whilest the amazed Marriner a farre, Gazing on th'vnknowne light, wonders what starre Heauen hath begot, to ease the aged Moone. When Pirrhus, stryding ore the cynders, stood On ground, where Troy late was; and with his Eye Measur'd the height of what he had throwne downe, A Citie, great in people, and in power: Walls built with hands of Gods; He now forgiue The ten yeares length, and thinkes his wounds well heald, Bath'd in the blood of Priams fifty sonnes. Yet am not I appeas'd, I must see more Then Towers, and Collomns tumble to the ground; 'Twas not the high built walles, and guiltlesse stones That Nero did prouoke; Themselues must be the wood To feed this fire, or quench it with their blood. Enter a Woman with a burnt Child. Wom: O my deare Infant, O my Child, my Child; Vnhappy comfort of my nine moneths paines; And did I beare thee, onely for the fire, Was I to that end made a Mother? Nero: I, now begins the sceane that I would haue. Enter a Man bearing another dead. Man: O Father speake yet; no, the mercilesse blowe Hath all bereft, speech, motion, sense, and life. Wom: O beauteous innocence, whitnes ill blackt, How to be made a coale couldst thou deserue? Man: O reuerend wrinckles, well becomming palenesse, Why hath death now lifes colours giuen thee, And mockes thee with the beauties of fresh youth? Wom: Why wert thou giuen me, to be tane away So soone, or could not Heauen tell how to punish But first by blessing mee. Man: Why were thy yeares lengthned so long, To be cut off vntimely? Nero: Play on, play on, and fill the golden skies With cryes, and pitie; with your blood; Mens Eyes. Wom: Where are thy flattering smiles, thy pretty kisses, And armes, that wont to writhe about my necke? Man. Where are thy Counsels, where their good example? And that kind roughnes of a Fathers anger? Wom: Whom haue I now to leaue my old age on? Man: Who shall I now haue to set right my youth, Within. Gods if yee be not fled from Heauen helpe vs. Nero: I like this Musique well; they like not mine: Now in the teares of all men, let me sing, Cantat. And make it doubtfull to the Gods aboue; Whether the Earth be pleas'd, or doe complaine. Man: But, may the man, that all this blood hath shed, Neuer bequeath to th'earth, an old gray head; Let him vntimely be cut off before, And leaue a course like this all wounds and gore. Be there no friend at hand, no standers by, In loue, or pittie mou'd, to close that Eye. O let him die the wish, and hate of all; And not a teare to grace his Funerall. exeunt. Wom: Heauen, you will heare (that which the world doth scorne,) The prayers of misery, and soules forlorne: Your anger waxeth by delaying stronger, O now for mercy be dispis'd no longer. Let him, that makes so many Mothers childlesse, Make his vnhappy, in her fruitfulnesse. Let him no issue leaue to beare his name Or some to right a Fathers wronged fame, Our flames to quit; be righteous in your yre, And when he dies, let him want funerall fire. exeunt. Nero: Let Heauen doe what it will this I haue done Already: doe you feele my furies waight, Rome is become a graue of her late greatnes; Her clowdes of smoke haue tane away the day, Her flames the night. Now vnbeleeuing Eyes what craue you more? Enter Neophilus to him. Neoph: O saue your selfe (my Lord) your Pallace burnes. Nero: My Pallace? how? what traiterous hand? Enter Tigellinus to them. Tigel: O flie my Lord, and saue your selfe betimes, The winde doth beate the fire vpon your house, The eating flame deuoures your double gates, Your pillars fall, your golden roofes doe melt, Your antique Tables, and Greeke Imagery: The fire besets, and the smoake you see Doth choake my speech, O flie, and saue your life. Nero: Heauen, thou dost striue, I see, for victory. exeunt. Enter Nimphideus solus. See how Fate workes vnto their purpos'd end; And without all selfe-Industry will raise, Whom they determine to make great and happy; Nero throwes downe himselfe, I stirre him not, He runnes vnto destruction, studies wayes To compasse danger, and attaine the hate Of all; Bee his owne wish is on his head: Nor Rome with fire, more then reuenges burne; Let me stand still, or lye, or sleepe, I rise. Poppea some new fauour will seeke out My wakings to salute, I cannot stirre, But messagers of new preferment meet me: Now, she hath made me Captaine of the Guard, So well I beare me in these night Allarmes, That she imagin'd I was made for Armes; I now command the Souldier, he the Citie, If any chance doe turne the Prince aside, (As many hatreds, mischiefes threaten him,) Ours is his wife, his seat and throwne is ours. He's next in right that hath the strongest powers. exit. Enter Sceuinus, Melechus. Sceui: O Troy, and O yee soules of our Forefathes, Which in your countreys fires were offred vp, How neere your Nephewes, to your fortunes come: Yet they were Grecian hands began your flame; But that our Temples, and our houses smoake, Our Marble buildings turne to be our Tombes, Burnt bones, and spurnt at Courses fill the streets, Not Pirrhus, nor thou Hanniball, art Author, Sad Rome is ruin'd by a Romane hand. But if to Neroes end, this onely way Heauens Iustice hath chose out, and peoples loue Could not but by this feebling ills be mou'd; We doe not then at all complaine our harmes, On this condition please vs, let vs die, And cloy the Parthian, with reuenge and pitie. Melic: My Master hath seald vp his Testament, Those bond-men which he liketh best set free, Giuen money, and more liberally then he vs'd: And now, as if a farewell to the world Were meant, A sumpteous banquet hath he made; Yet not with countenance that feasters vse, But cheeres his friends the whilest himselfe lookes sad. Scen: I haue from fortunes Temple tane this sword, May it be fortunate, and now at least Since it could not preuent, punish the Euill; To Rome it had bin better done before, But though lesse helping now, they'le praise it more. Great Soueraigne of all mortall actions Whom onely wretched men, and Poets blame, Speed thou the weapon, which I haue from thee. 'Twas not amidst thy Temple Monuments In vaine repos'd, somewhat I know't hath done: O with new honours let it be laid vp: Strike bouldly, arme so many powerfull prayers Of dead, and liuing houer ouer thee. Melic: And though sometimes, with talke impertinent, And idle fances, he would faine a mirth; Yet is it easie seene, somewhat is here The which, he dares not let his face make shew of. Sceuin: Long want of losse hath made it dull, and blunt: See, Melichus, this weapon better edg'd. Melic: Sharpning of swords, when must wee then haue blowes, Or meanes my Master, Cato-like, to exempt Himselfe from power of Fates, and cloy'd with life, Giue the Gods backe their vnregarded gift, But he hath neither Catoes minde, nor cause; A man giuen ore to pleasures, and soft ease: Which makes me still to doubt, how in affaires Of Princes he dares meddle, or desires? Sceuin: We shall haue blowes on both sides, Melichus; Prouide me store of cloathes to bind vp wounds: What an't be heart, for heart, Death is the worst; The Gods sure keepe it, hide from vs that liue How sweet death is, because we should goe on And be their bailes: There are about the house Some stones that will stanch blood, see them set vp: This world I see hath no felicitie, Ile trie the other. Melic: Neroes life is soft, The sword's prepar'd against anothers breast, The helpe for his; it can be no priuate foe, For then 'twere best to make it knowne, and call His troupes of bond, and freed men to his aide: Besides his Counsellors, Seneca, And Lucan, are no Managers of quarrels. Sceuin: Me thinkes, I see him struggling on the ground. Heare his vnmanly outcries, and lost prayers Made to the Gods, which turne their heads away. Nero, this day must end the worlds desires, And head-long send thee, to vnquenched fires. exit. Melic: Why doe I further idly stand debating, My proofes are but too many, and too pregnant, And Princes Eares still to suspitions open: Who euer, being but accus'd, was quit; For States are wise, and cut of ylls that may be; Meane men must die, that t'other may sleepe sound, Chiefely, that rule, whose weaknes apt to feares, And bad deserts of all men, makes them know There's none but is in heart, what hee's accus'd. exit. Finis Actus Tertij.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter Nero, PoppÃ¦a, Nimphidius, Tigellinus, Neophitus, and Epaphroditus. Nero: This kisse sweet loue, Ile force from thee and this, And of such spoiles, and victories be prowder, Then if I had the fierce Panonian, Or gray-eyd German ten times ouercome. Let Iulius goe, and fight at end oth'world, And conquer from the wilde inhabitants Their cold, and pouerty; whilest Nero, here, Makes other warres, warres where the conquerd gaines, Where to ore-come, is to be prisoner. O willingly, I giue my freedome vp; And put on my owne chaines; And am in loue with my captiuitie; Such Venus is, when on the sand shore Of Xanthus or on Idas pleasant greene She leades the dance; Her, the Nimphes all are we, And smyling graces doe accompany. If Bacchus could his stragling Mynion Grace, with a glorious wreath of shining Starres; Why should not Heauen my PoppÃ¦a Crowne? The Northerne teeme shall moue into a round; New consteliations rise, to honour thee; The Earth shall wooe thy fauours, and the Sea Lay his rich shells, and treasure at thy feete. For thee, Hidaspis shall throw vp his gold, Pauchaia breath the rich delightfull smells, The Seres, and the feather'd man of Inde Shall their fine arts, and curious labours bring: And where the Sunn's not knowne, PoppÃ¦as name Shall midst their feasts, and barbarous pompe be sung. PoppÃ¦: I, now I am worthy to be Queene oth'world, Fairer then Uenus, or the Bacchus loue: But you'le anone, vnto your cutt-boy, Sporus, Your new made woman; to whom, now I heare You are wedded too. Nero: I wedded? PoppÃ¦: I, you wedded; Did you not heare the words oth' Auspyces, Was not the boy in bride-like garments drest, Marriage bookes seald, as 'twere for yssue, to Be had betweene you, solemne feasts prepar'd; While all the Court, with God-giue you Ioy, sounds. It had bin good Domitius your Father Had nere had other wife: Nero: Your froward foole, y'are still so bitter, whose that? Enter Melichus to them. Nimph: One that it seemes, my Lord, doth come in hast. Nero: Yet in his face he sends his tale before him, Bad newes thou tellest. Melic: 'Tis bad I tell, but good that I can tell it, Therefore your Maiestie will pardon me, If I offend your eares to saue your life. Nero: Why, is my life indangerd? How ends this circumstance, thou wrackst my thoughts. Meli: My Lord your life is conspir'd against, Nero: By whom? Meli; I must be of the world excus'd in this, If the great dutie to your Maiestie: Makes me all other lesser to neglect. Nero: Th'art a tedious fellow, speake, by whom? Melic: By my Master. Nero; Who's thy Master? Meli: Sceuinus. PoppÃ¦: Sceuinus, why should he conspire? Vnlesse he thinke, that likenesse in conditions May make him too, worthy oth'Empire thought. Nero: Who are else in it? I thinke Natalis, Subius, Flauius, Lucan, Seneca, and Lucius Piso, Asper, and Quintilianus. Nero: Ha done, Thou'ilt reckon all Rome anone and so thou maist, Th'are villaines all, Ile not trust one of them; O that the Romanes had but all one necke. PoppÃ¦: Pisoes she creeping into mens affections. And popular arts, haue giuen long cause of doubt, And th'others late obseru'd discontents Risen from misinterpreted disgraces, May make vs credit this relation. Nero: Where are they? come they not vpon vs yet? See the Guard doubted, see the Gates shut vp, Why, the'yle surprise vs in our Court anon. Meli: Not so my Lord, they are at Pisoes house, And thinke themselues, yet safe, and vndiscry'd. Nero: Lets thither then, And take them in this false security; Tigel: 'Twere better first publish them traytors. Nymph: That were to make them so, And force them all vpon their Enemies; Now, without stirre, or hazard theyle be tane, And boldly try all dare, and law demaund; Besides, this accusation may be forg'd By mallice or mistaking. Poppe: What likes you, doe Nimphidius, out of hand, Two wayes distract, when either would preuaile; If they suspecting but this fellowes absence, Should try the Citie, and attempt their friends, How dangerous might Pisoes fauour be. Nimph: I to himselfe would make the matter cleare, Which now vpon one seruants credit stands: The Cities fauour keepes within the bonds Of profit, they'le loue none, to hurt themselues; Honour, and friendship they heare others name, Themselues doe neither feele, nor know the same; To put them yet, (though needlesse) in some feare, Weele keepe their streets with armed companies: Then if they stirre, they see their wiues, and houses Prepar'd a pray to th'greedy Souldier. Poppe: Let vs be quicke then, you, to Pisoes house, While I, and Tigellinus further sift This fellowes knowledge. Ex. omnes Pretor Nero. Nero: Looke to the gates, and walles oth'Citie, looke The riuer be well kept, haue watches set In euery passage, and in euery way; But who shall watch these watches, what if they Begin, and play the Traitors first? O where shall I Seeke faith, or them that I may wisely trust? The Citie fauours the conspirators, The Senate, in disgrace, and feare hath lin'd; The Campe, why most are souldiers that he named, Besides, he knowes not all; and like a foole I interrupted him, else had he named Those that stood by me; O securitie. Which we so much seeke after, yet art still To Courts a stranget, and dost rather choose, The smoaky reedes, and sedgy cottages, Then the proud roofes, and wanton cost of Kings. O sweet dispised ioyes of pouerty, A happines vnknowne vnto the Gods: Would I had rather in poore Gallij bin, Or VlubrÃ¦, a ragged Magistrate, Sat as a Iudge of measures, and of corne, Then the adored Monarke of the world. Mother, thou didst deseruedly in this, That from a priuate, and sure state, didst raise My fortunes, to this slippery hill of greatnesse; Where I can neither stand, nor fall with life. Exit. Enter Piso, Lucan, Sceuinus, Flauius. Flau: But since we are discouer'd, what remaines? But put our liues vpon our hnads, these swords Shall try vs Traitors, or true Citizens. Sceui: And what should make this hazard doubt successe, Stout men are oft with sudden onsets danted, What shall this Stage-player be? Luc: It is not now, Augustus grauitie, nor Tiberius craft, But Tigellinus, and Crisogorus Eunuckes, and women that we goe against. Sceui: This for thy owne sake, this for ours we begg, That thou wilt suffer him to be orecome; Why shouldst thou keepe so many vowed swords From such a hated throate? Flaui: Or shall we feare, To trust vnto the Gods so good a cause. Luca: By this we may, our selues Heauens fauour promise, Because all noblenesse, and worth on earth We see's on our side; Here the Faby's sonne, Here the Coruini are, and take that part; There noble Fathers would, if now they liu'd; There's not a soule that claimes Nobilitie Either by his, or his fore-fathers merit, But is with vs; with vs the gallant youth Whom passed dangers or hote bloud makes bould: Staid men suspect their wisedome, or their faith, To whom our counsels we haue not reueald. And while (our party seeking to disgrace) They traitors call vs, Each man treason praiseth, And hateth faith, when Piso is a traitor. Sceui: And at aduenture? what by stoutnesse can Befall vs worse, then will by cowardise? If both the people, and the souldier failde vs, Yet shall we die at least worthy our selues, Worthy our ancestors: O Piso thinke, Thinke on that day, when in the Parthian fields Thou cryedst to th'flying Legions to turne, And looke Death in the face; he was not grim, But faire and louely, when he came in armes. O why, there did we not on Syrian swords? Were we reseru'd to prisons, and to chaines. Behold the Galley-asses in euery street, And euen now they come to clap on yrons; Must Pisoes head be shewed vpon a pole? Those members torne; rather then Roman-like, And Piso-like, with weapons in our hands Fighting, in throng of enemies to die: And that it shall not be a ciuill warre Nero preuents, whose cruelty hath left Few Citizens; we are not Romans now, But Moores, and Iewes, and vtmost Spaniards, And Asiaes refuge that doe fill the Citie. Piso: Part of vs are already tak'n, the rest Amaz'd, and seeking holes; Our hidden ends You see laid open, Court, and Citie arm'd, And for feare ioyning to the part they feare. Why should we moue desperate, and hopelesse armes And vainely spill that noble bloud, that should Christall Rubes, and the Median fields, Not Tiber colour: And the more your show be Your loues, and readinesse to loose your liues, The lother I am to aduenture them. Yet am I proud, you would for me haue dy'd, But liue, and keepe your selues to worthier ends; No Mother but my owne shall weepe my death, Nor will I make by ouerthrowing vs, Heauen guiltie of more faults, yet from the hopes, Your owne good wishes, rather then the thing Doe make you see, this comfort I receiue Of death vnforst. O friends, I would not die When I can liue no longer; 'Tis my glory, That free, and willing I giue vp this breath, Leauing such courages as yours vntri'd. But to be long in talke of dying, would Shew a relenting, and a doubtfull mind: By this you shall my quiet thoughts intend; I blame nor Earth, nor Heauen for my end. He dies. Lucan: O that this noble courage had bin shewne, Rather on enemies breasts, then on thy owne. Sceui: But sacred, and inviolate be thy will, And let it lead, and teach vs; This sword I could more willingly haue thrust Through Neroes breast; That, fortune deni'd me, It now shall through Sceuinus. Enter Tigellinus solus. What multitudes of villaines are here gotten In a conspiracy; which Hydra like, Still in the cutting off, increaseth more. The more we take, the more are still appeach, And euery man brings in new company. I wonder what we shall doe with them all, The prisons cannot hold more then they haue, The Iayles are full, the holes with Gallants stincke, Strawe and gold lace together liue I thinke: 'Twere best euen shut the gates oth'Citie vp, And make it all one Iayle; for, this I am sure, There's not an honest man within the walles: And though the guilty doth exceed the free; Yet through a base, and fatall cowardise, They all assist, in taking one another, And by their owne hands are to prison led. There's no condition, nor degree of men, But here are met; Men of the sword, and gowne, Plebeans, Senators, and women too, Ladies that might haue slaine him with their Eye, Would vse their hands, Philosophers, And Polititians; Polititians? Their plot was laid too short; Poets would now, Not onely write, but be the arguments Of Tragedies: The Emperour's much pleas'd: But some haue named Seneca, and I Will haue Petroneus, one promise of pardon, Or feare of torture, will accusers find. exit. Enter Nimphidius, Lucan, Sceuinus, with a guard. Nimph: Though Pisoes suddennesse, and guilty hand Preuented hath the death he should haue had; Yet you abide it must. Luca: O may the earth lye lightly on his Course, Sprinckle his ashes with your flowers and teares, The loue and dainties of Mankind is gone. Sceui: What onely now we can, we'le follow thee That way thou lead'st, and waite on thee in death, Which we had done, had not these hindred vs. Nimph: Nay, other ends your grieuous crimes awaite, Ends which the law and your deserts exact. Sceui: What haue we deserued? Nimph: That punishment that traitors vnto Princes, And enemies to the State they liue in merit. Sceuin: If by the State, this gouernment you meane, I iustly am an enemy vnto it. That's but to Nero, you, and Tigellinus: That glorious world, that euen beguiles the wise, Being lookt into, includes but three, or foure. Corrupted men, which were they all remou'd, 'Twould for the common State much better be. Nimph: Why, what can you ith'gouerment mislike? Vnlesse it grieue you, that the world's in peace, Or that our armes conquer without blood. Hath not his power with forraine visitations, And strangers honour more acknowldg'd bin, Then any was afore him? Hath not hee Dispos'd of frontier kingdomes, with successe, Giuen away Crownes, whom he set vp, preuailing? The riuall seat of the ArsacidÃ¦, That thought their brightnesse equall vnto ours, Is't crown'd by him, by him doth raigne? If we haue any warre, it's beyond Rheme, And Euphrates, and such whose different chances Haue rather seru'd for pleasure, and discourse, Then troubled vs; At home the Citie hath Increast in wealth, with building bin adorn'd; The arts haue flourisht, and the Muses sung, And that, his Iustice, and well tempred raigne, Hath the best Iudges pleas'd, the powers diuine; Their blessings, and so long prosperitie Of th'Empire vnder him, enough declare. Sceui: You freed the State from warres abroad, but 'twas To spoile at home more safely, and diuert The Parthian enmitie on vs, and yet, The glory rather, and the spoyles of warre Haue wanting bin, the losse, and charge we haue. Your peace is full of cruelty, and wrong, Lawes taught to speake to present purposes, Wealth, and faire houses dangerous faults become, Much blood ith'Citie, and no common deaths, But Gentlemen, and Consulary houses: On CÃ¦sars owne house looke, hath that bin free? Hath he not shed the blood he calls diuine? Hath not that neerenes which should loue beget Alwayes on him, bin cause of hate, and feare; Vertue, and power suspected, and kept downe: They whose great ancestors this Empire made, Distrusted in the gouernment thereof; A happy state, where Decius is a traytor, Narcissus true, nor onely wast vnsafe T'offend the Prince, his freed men worse were feard, Whose wrongs with such insulting pride were heard, That euen the faultie it made innocent: If we complain'd, that was it selfe a crime, I, though it were to CÃ¦sars benefit; Our writings pry'd into, falce guiltines (Thinking each taxing pointed out it selfe) Our priuate whisperings listned after; nay, Our thoughts were forced out of vs, and punisht: And had it bin in you, to haue taken away Our vnderstanding, as you did our speech, You would haue made vs thought this honest too? Nimph: Can malice narrow eyes, See anything yet more it can traduce. Sceui: His long continued taxes I forbeare, In which he chiefely showed him to be Prince, His robbing Alters, sale of Holy things, The Antique Goblets of adored rust, And sacred gifts of Kings, and people sold. Nor was the spoile more odious, then the vse, They were imployd on, spent on shame, and lust Which still haue bin so endlesse in their change, And made vs know a diuers seruitude. But that he hath bin suffered so long, And prospered, as you say: for that, to thee O Heauen, I turne my selfe, and cry; No God Hath care of vs, yet haue we our reuenge, As much as Earth may be reueng'd on Heauen; Their diuine honour Nero shall vsurpe, And prayers, and feasts, and adoration haue, As well as Iupiter. Nimph: Away blaspheming tongue Be euer silent for thy bitternesse. Exeunt. Enter Nero, PoppÃ¦a, Tigellinus, Flauius, Neophilus, Epaphroditus, and a yong man. Nero: What could cause thee, Forgetfull of my benefits, and thy oath, To seeke my life. Plaui: Nero, I hated thee; Nor was there any of thy souldiers More faithfull, while thou faith deseru'dst then I, Together did I leaue to be a subiect, And thou a Prince, CÃ¦sar was now become A player on the Stage, a Waggoner, A burner of our houses, and of vs, A Paracide of Wife, and Mother. Tigel: Villaine dost know where, &amp; of whom thou speakst? Nero: Haue you but one death for him, let it bee A feeling one (Tigellinus) bee't Thy charge, and let me see thee witty in't. Tigell: Come sirrah Weele see how stoutly you'le stretch out your necke. Flaui: Wold thou durst strike as stoutly, Ex. Tig. &amp; Flau: Nero: And what's hee there? Epaph: One that in whispering oreheard What pitie 'twas, my Lord, that Piso died. Nero: And why wast pitie sirrah, Piso died? Yong: My Lord 'twas pitie he deseru'd to die. PoppÃ¦: How much this youth, my Otho doth resemble; Otho, my first, my best loue, who is now (Vnder pretext of gouerning) exyl'd To Lucitania, honourably banisht. Nero: Well, if you be so passionate, Ile make you spend your pitie on your Prince, And good men, not on traytors. Yong: The Gods forbid my Prince should pitie need. Somewhat, the sad remembrance did me stirre Oth'fraile and weake condition of our kind, Somewhat his greatnesse; then whom yesterday, The world, but CÃ¦sar, could shew nothing higher; Besides, some vertues and some worth he had, That might excuse my pitie, to an end So cruell, and vnripe. PoppÃ¦: I know not how this stranger moues my mind, His face me thinkes is not like other mens, Nor doe they speake thus; Oh, his words inuade My weakned senses, and ouercome my heart. Nero: Your pitie shewes, your fauour and your will Which side you are inclinde too, had your power, You can but pitie, else should CÃ¦sar feare, Your ill affection then shall punisht bee. Take him to execution, he shall die, That the death pities of mine enemie. Yong: This benefit at least. Sad death shall giue, to free me from the power Of such a gouernment; and if I die For pitying humane chance, and Pisoes end, There will be some too, that will pitie mine. PoppÃ¦: O what a dauntlesse looke, what sparkling eyes, Threating in suffering; sure some noble blood Is hid in ragges, feares argues a base spirit In him what courage, and contempt of death, And shall I suffer one I loue to die? He shall not die? hands of this man, away, Nero, thou shalt not kill this guiltlesse man. Nero: He guiltlesse, strumpet. Spurns her and PoppÃ¦a falls. She's in loue with the smoath face of the boy. Neoph. Alas my Lord you haue slaine her. Epaph: Helpe she dies. Nero: PoppÃ¦a, PoppÃ¦a, speake, I am not angry, I did not meane to hurt thee, speake sweet loue. Neoph: Shee's dead my Lord. Nero: Fetch her againe, she shall not die, Ile ope the Iron gates of hell, And breake the imprisond shaddowes of the deepe, And force from death this farre too worthy pray, Shee is not dead. The crimson red, that like the morning shone, When from her windowes, (all with Roses strewde,) She peepeth forth, forsakes not yet her cheekes, Her breath, that like a hony-suckle smelt twining about the prickled Eglintine, Yet moues her lipes; those quicke, and piercing eyes, That did in beautie challenge heauens eyes Yet shine as they were wont: O no they doe not, See how they grow obscure: O see, they close, And cease to take, or giue light to the world. What starres so ere you are assur'd to grace The firmament, (for loe the twinkling fires Together throng, and that cleare milky space Of stormes, and Phiades, and thunder void, Prepares your roome,) doe not with wry aspect Looke on your Nero, who in blood shall mourne Your lucklesse fate; And many a breathing soule, Send after you to waite vpon their Queene; This shall begin, the rest shall follow after, And fill the streets with outcryes, and with slaughter. Ex. Enter Seneca, with two of his friends. Senec: What meanes your mourning, this vngratefull sorrow? Where are your precepts of Philosophie? Where our prepared resolution, So many yeeres fore-studied against danger? To whom is Neroes cruelty vnknowne? Or what remained after mothers blood, But his instructers death? Leaue, leaue these teares, Death from me nothing takes, but what's a burthen, A clog, to that free sparke of Heauenly fire: But that in Seneca, the which you lou'd, Which you admir'd, doth, and shall still remaine Secure of death, vntouched of the graue. 1. Friend. Weele not belie our teares, we waile not thee, It is our selues, and our owne losse we grieue; To thee, what losse in such a change can bee, Vertue is paid her due, by death alone; To our owne losses doe we giue these teares, That loose thy loue, thy boundlesse knowledge loose, Loose the vnpatternd sample of thy vertue, Loose whatsoeu'r may praise, or sorrow moue; In all these losses, yet of this we glory, That 'tis thy happinesse that makes vs sorry. 2. Friend. If there be any place for Ghosts of good men, If (as we haue bin long taught) great mens soules Consume not with their bodies, thou shalt see, (Looking from out the dwellings of the ayre) True duties to thy memorie perform'd; Not in the outward pompe of funerall, But in remembrance of thy deeds, and words, The oft recalling of thy many vertues, The Tombe, that shall th'eternall relickes keepe Of Seneca, shall be his hearers hearts. Senec: Be not afraid my soule, goe cheerefully, To thy owne Heauen, from whence it first let downe, Thou loath by this imprisoning flesh putst on, Now lifted vp, thou rauisht shalt behold The truth of things, at which we wonder here, And foolishly doe wrangle on beneath; And like a God shalt walke the spacious ayre, And see what euen to conceit's deni'd. Great soule oth'world, that through the parts defus'd Of this vast All, guid'st what thou dost informe; You blessed mindes, that from the Pheares you moue, Looke on mens actions not with idle eyes; And Gods we goe to, Aaid me in this strife, And combat of my flesh, that ending, I May still shew Seneca, and my selfe die. Exeunt. Enter Antonius, Enanthe. Anto: Sure this message of the Princes, So grieuous and vnlookt for, will appall Petronius much. Enan: Will not death any man? Anto: It will; but him so much the more, That hauing liu'd to his pleasure; shall forgoe So delicate a life, I doe not maruell That Seneoa, and such sowre fellowes, can Leaue that they neu'r tasted: But when we That haue the Nectar of thy kisses felt, That drinkes away the troubles of this life, And but one banquet make of forty yeeres, Must come to leaue this: but soft, here he is. Enter Petroneus, and a Centurion. Petron: Leaue me a while, Centurion to my friends, Let me my farewell take, and thou shalt see, Neroes commandement quickly obaid in mee. ex. Centurion. Come let vs drinke, and dash the posts with wine Here throwe your flowers; fill me a swelling bowle, Such as Mecenas, or my Lucan dranke On Virgills birth day. Enan: What meanes (Petroneus) this vnseasonable, And causelesse mirth? Why, comes not from the Prince This man to you, a messenger of death, Petro: Here faire Enanthe, whose plumpe ruddy cheeke Exceeds the grape, it makes this; here my geyrle. He drinks. And thinkst thou death, a matter of such harme, Why, he must haue this pretty dimpling chin, And will pecke out those eyes that now so wound. Enan: Why, is it not th'extreamest of all ills? Petro: It is indeed the last, and end of ills; The Gods, before th'would let vs tast deaths Ioyes, Plac't vs ith toyle, and sorrowes of this world, Because we should perceiue th'amends, and thanke them, Death, the grim knaue, but leades you to the doore, Where entred once, all curious pleasures come To meete, and welcome you. A troupe of beauteous Ladies from whose eyes, Loue, thousand arrowes, thousand graces shootes; Puts forth their faire hands to you, and inuites To their greene arbours, and close shadowed walles, Whence, banisht is the roughnesse of our yeeres: Onely the west wind blowes; Ith euer Spring, And euer Sommer: There the laden bowes Offer their tempting burdens to your hand, Doubtfull your eye, or tast inuiting more: There euery man his owne desires enioyes; Faire Lucrese lies, by lusty Tarquins side, And wooes him now againe to rauish her. Nor vs, (though Romane) Lais will refuse, To Corinth any man may goe; no maske, No enuious garment doth those beauties hide, Which Nature made, so mouing, to be spide, But in bright Christall, which doth supply all, And white transparent vailes they are attyr'd, Through which the pure snowe vnderneath doth shine; (Can it be snowe, from whence such flames arise?) Mingled with that faire company, shall we On bankes of Violets, and of Hiacinths Of loues deuising, sit, and gently sport, And all the while melodious Musique heare, And Poets songs, that Musique farre exceed The old Anaicean crown'd with smyling flowers, And amorous Sapho, on her Lesbian Lute Beauties sweet Scarres, and Cupids godhead sing, Anto: What, be not rauisht with thy fancies, doe not Court nothing, nor make loue vnto our feares. Petro: Ist nothing that I say? Anto: But empty words. Petro: Why, thou requir'st some instance of the eye, Wilt thou goe with me then, and see that world? Which either will returne thy old delights; Or square thy appetite anew to theirs. Anto: Nay; I had rather farre beleeue thee here, Others ambition such discoueries seeke; Faith, I am satisfied with the base delights Of common men; A wench, a house I haue, And of my owne a garden, Ile not change, For all your walkes, and Ladies, and rare fruits. Petro: Your pleasures must of force resigne to these, In vaine you shunne the sword, in vaine the sea, In vaine is Nero fear'd, or flatered, Hether you must, and leaue your purchast houses, Your new made garden, and your blacke browd wife, And of the trees thou hast so quaintly set; Not one, but the displeasant Cipresse shall Goe with thee. Anton: Faith 'tis true, we must at length, But yet Petroneus, while we may, awhile We would enoioy them, those we haue, w'are sure of, When that you talke of's doubfull, and to come. Petro: Perhaps thou thinkst to liue yet twenty yeeres, Which may vnlookt for be cut off, as mine, If not, to endlesse time compar'd, is nothing What you endure must euer, endure now; Nor stay not, to be last at table set, Each best day of our life at first doth goe, To them succeeds diseased age, and woe; Now die your pleasures, and the dayes your pray Your rimes, and loues, and iests will take away. Therefore my sweet, yet thou wilt goe with mee, And not liue here, to what thou wouldst not see. Enan: Would y'haue me then kill my selfe, and die, And goe I know not to what places there. Petro: What places dost thou feare? The'll fauoured lake they tell thee thou must passe. And thy blacke frogs that croake about the brim. Enan: O pardon Sir, though death affrights a woman; Whose pleasures, though you timely here diuine, The paines we know, and see, Petron: The paine is lifes, death rids that paine away, Come boldly, there's no danger in this foord, Children passe through it: If it be a paine, You haue this comfort, that you past it are. Enan: Yet all, as well as I, are loath to die. Petro: Iudge them by deed, you see them doe't apace Enan: I, but tis loathly, and against their wils. Petro: Yet, know you not that any being dead, Repented them, and would haue liu'd againe, They then there errors saw, and foolish prayers, But you are blinded in the loue of life, Death is but sweet to them that doe approach it To me as one that tak'n with Delphick rage, When the diuining God his breast doth fill, He sees what others cannot standing by, It seemes a beauteous, and a pleasant thing; Where is my deaths Phisitian? Phisi: Here my Lord. Petro: Art ready? Phisi: I my Lord. Petro; And I for thee: Nero, my end shall mocke thy tyranny. Exeunt. Finis Actus Quarti.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Enter Nero, Nimphidius Tigellinus, Neophilus, Epaphroditus, and other attendants. Nero: Enough is wept, PoppÃ¦a, for thy death, Enough is bled, so many teares of others Wailing their losses haue wipt mine away Who in the common funerall of the world Can mourne on death? Tigell: Besides, your Maiestie this benefit In their diserued punishment shall reape From all attempts hereafter to be freed, Conspiracy is now for euer dasht, Tumult supprest, rebellion out of heart; In Pisoes death, danger it selfe did die. Nimph: Piso that thought to climbe by bowing downe, By giuing away to thriue, and raising others To become great himselfe, hath now by death Giuen quiet to your thoughts, and feare to theirs That shall from treason their aduancement plot; Those dangerous heads, that his ambition leand on, And they by it crept vp, and from their meannesse Thought in this stirre to rise aloft, are off: Now peace, and safetie waite vpon your throne; Securitie hath wall'd your seat about, There is no place for feare left. Nero: Why, I neuer feard them. Nimph: That was your fault. Your Maiestie must giue vs leaue to blame Your dangerous courage, and that noble soule Too prodigall of it selfe. Nero: A Princes mind knowes neither feare, nor hope, The beames of royall Maiestie are such, As all eyes are with it amaz'd, and weakened, But it with nothing; I at first contemn'd Their weake deuises, and faint enterprise: Why, thought they against him to haue preuail'd, Whose childhood was from Messalinas spight By Dragons, (that the earth gaue vp) preseru'd, Such guard my cradle had; for fate had then Pointed me out, to be what now I am. Should all the Legions, and the prouinces In one vnited, against me conspire: I could disperce them with one angry eye. My brow's an host of men; Come Tigellinus, Let turne this bloody banquet, Piso meant vs, Vnto a merry feast, weele drinke and challenge Fortune; whose that Neophilus? Enter a Roman. Neoph: A Currier from beyond the Alpes my Lord. Nero: Newes of some German victorie belike, Or Britton ouerthrow. Neoph: The Letters come from France. Nimp: Why smiles your Maiestie? Nero: So I smile, I should be afraid there's one In Armes Nimphidius. Nimp: What arm'd against your Maiestie? Nero: Our Lieuetenant of the Prouince, Iulius Vindex. Tigell: Who, that guiddy French-man? Nimp: His Prouince is disarm'd my Lord, he hath No legion, not a souldier vnder him. Epaph: One that by blood, and rapine would repaire His state consum'd in vanities, and lust. Enter another Roman. Tigell: He would not find out three to follow him. A mess: More newes my Lord. Nero: Is it of Vindex that thou hast to say? Mess: Vindex is vp, and with him France in Armes. The Noble men, and people throng to th'cause, Money, and Armour, Cities doe conferre, The contrey doth send in prouision Yong men bring bodies, old men lead them forth, Ladies doe coine their Iewels into pay, The sickle now is fram'd into a sword, And drawing horses are to manage taught, France nothing doth but warre, and fury breath. Nero: All this fierce talk's, but Vindex doth rebell, And I will hang him. Tigell. How long came you forth after the former messenger. Mess: Foure dayes, but by the benefit of sea, and weather, am arriued with him. Neoph. How strong was Uindex at your comming forth? Mess: He was esteem'd a hundred thousand. Tigell: Men enough, Nimph. And souldiours few enough. Tumultuary troopes, vndisciplin'd, Vntrain'd in seruice, to wast victuals good, But when they come to looke on warres blacke wounds, And but a farre off see the face of death. Nero: It falles out for my empty coffers well, The spoyle of such a large and goodly Prouince, Enricht with trade, and long enioyed peace. Tigell: What order will your Maiestie haue taken For leuying forces to suppresse this stirre? Nero: What order should we take? weele laugh, &amp; drinke, Thinkst thou it fit my pleasures be disturb'd When any French-man list to breake his necke? They haue not heard of Pisoes Fortune yet, Let that Tale fight with them. Nimph. What order needs: your Maiestie shall finde This French heat quickly of it selfe grow cold. Nero. Come away. Nothing shall come that this nights sport shall stay. Ex. Ner. Manet Neophilus, Epaphroditus. Neoph. I wonder what makes him so confident In this reuolt now growne vnto a warre, And ensignes in the field, when in the other, Being but a plot of a conspiracie, He shew'd himselfe so wretchedly dismaid, Epaph. Faith, the right nature of a coward to set light Dangers that seeme farre off. Piso was here, Ready to enter at the Presence doore, And dragge him out of his abused chaire, And then he trembled; Vindex is in France, And many woods, and seas, and hills betweene. Neoph. Twas strange that Piso was so soone supprest, Epaph: Strange, strange indeed, for had he but come vp, And taken the Court, in that affright and stirre, While vnresolu'd for whom, or what to doe, Each on the other had in iealousie (While as apaled Maiestie not yet Had time to set the countenance) he would Haue hazarded the royall seat. Neoph: Nay, had it without hazard; all the Court Had for him bin, and those disclos'd their loue, And fauour in the cause, which now to hide, And colour their good meanings ready were To shew their forwardnesse against it most. Epaph: But for a stranger with a naked prouince, Without allies, or friends ith'state to challenge A Prince vpheld with thirty Legions Rooted in foure discents of Ancestors, And foureteene yeares continuance of raigne, Why it isâ Enter Nero, Nimphidius, Tigellinus to them. Nero: Galba and Spaine, what Spaine and Gala too? ex Ner Nimph: Epaph: I pray thee Tigellinus, what furie's this? What strange euent, what accident hath thus Orecast your countenances? Tigell. Downe we were set at table, and began With sparckling bowles to chase our feares away, And mirth and pleasure lookt out of our eyes; When loe a breathlesse messenger comes in And tells how Vindex, and the powers of France Haue Segius Galba chosen Emperor, With what applause the Legions him receiue, That Spaines reuolted; Portingale hath ioyn'd; As much suspected is of Germany; But Nero, not abiding out the end, Orethrew the tables, dasht against the ground The cuppe which he so much you know esteem'd; Teareth his haire, and with incensed rage Curseth false men, and Gods the lookers on. Neoph: His rage we saw was wild and desperate. Epaph: O you vnsearched wisedomes, which doe laugh, At our securitie, and feares alike! And plaine to shew our weakenesse, and your power Make vs contemne the harmes, which surest strike When you our glories, and our pride vndoe, Our ouerthrow you make rediculous too. exeunt. Enter Nimphidius solus. Slow making counsels, and the sliding yeere Haue brought me to the long foreseene destruction Of this mifled yong man; his State is shaken, And I will push it on; reuolted France; Nor the coniured Prouinces of Spaine, Nor his owne guilt, shall like to me oppresse him; I to his easie yeelding feares proclaime New German mutenys, and all the world Rowsing it selfe in hate of Neroes name; I his distracted counsels doe disperce With fresh despaires, I animate the Senate And the people, to ingage them past recall In preiudice of Nero, and in brief, Perish he must, the fates and I resolue it; Which to effect, I presently will goe, Proclaime a Donatiue in Galbaes name. Enter Antoneus to him. Anton: Yonders Nimphidius our Commander, now, I with respect must speake, and smooth my brow; Captaine all haile. Nimp: Antoneus well met, Your place of Tribune in this Anarchi. Anton: This Anarchy my Lord, is Nero dead? Nimph: This Anarchy, this yet vnstiled time, While Galba is vnseased of the Empire Which Nero hath forsooke. Anton: Hath Nero then resign'd the Empire? Nimph: In effect he hath, for he's fled to Egypt. Anton: My Lord you tell strange newes to me. Nimph: But nothing strange to mee, Who euery moment, knew of his despaires, The Curriers came so fast with fresh alarmes Of new reuolts, that he vnable quite To beare his feares, which he had long conceal'd, Is now reuoulted from himselfe, and fled. Anto: Thrust with reports, and rumours from his seat. My Lord you know the Campe depends on you As you determine. Nimph: There it lies Antonius, What should we doe, it boots not to relie On Neroes stinking fortunes, and to sit Securely looking on, were to receiue An Emperor from Spaine; which how disgracefull It were to vs, who if we waigh our selues The most materiall accessions are Of all the Roman Empire, which disgrace To couer we must ioyne our selues betimes, And thereby seeme to haue created Gabba; Therefore Ile straight proclaime a Donatiue, Of thirty thousand sisterces a man. Anto: I thinke so great a gift was neuer heard of. Galba they say is frugally inclinde, Will he avow so great a gift as this? Nimph: How ere he like of it, he must avow it, If by our promise he be once ingaged; And since the souldiers care belongs to mee, I will haue care of them, and of their good. Let them thanke me, if I through this occasion Procure for them so great a donatiue. Ex: Nimp: Anton: So you be thankt, it skils not who preuaile, Galba, or Nero, traitor to them both; You giue it out that Neroes fled to Egypt, Who with the frights of your reports, amaz'd, By our deuice, doth lurke for better newes, Whilst you ineuitably doe betray him, Workes he all this for Galba then? not so I haue long seene his climbing to the Empire By secret practises of gracious women, And other instruments of the late Court, That was his loue to her that me refus'd; And now by this he would giue the souldiers fauour; Now is the time to quit PoppÃ¦as scorne, And his rivallity; Ile straight reueale His treacheries, to Galbaes agents here. Exit: Enter Tigellinus with the Guard. Tigell: You see what issue things doe sort vnto, Yet may we hope not onely impunitie, But with our fellowes part oth'guift proclaim'd. Nero meets them. Nero: Whether goe you, stay my friends; 'Tis CÃ¦sar calles you, stay my louing friends. Tigell: We were his slaues, his footstooles, and must crouch; But now, with such obseruance to his feet, It is his misery that calles vs friends. Nero. And moues you not the misery of a Prince? O stay my friends, stay, harken to the voyce Which once yee knew. Tigell: Harke to the peoples cryes, Harke to the streets, that Galba, Galba ring. Nero: The people may forsake me without blame, I did them wrong to make you rich, and great, I tooke their houses to bestow on you: Treason in them hath name of libertie, Your fault hath no excuse, you are my fault, And the excuse of others treachery. Tigell: Shall we with staying seeme his tyrannies T'vphold, as if we were in loue with them? We are excus'd vnlesse we stay too long, As forced Ministers, and apart of wrong. ex. preter Nero. Nero: O now I see the vizard from my face So louely, and so fearefull is fall'n off That vizard, shadow, nothing (Maiestie) (Which like a child acquainted with his feares, But now men trembled at, and now contemne) Nero forsaken is of all the world. The world of truth; O fall some vengeance downe Equall vnto their falsehoods, and my wrongs; Might I accept the Chariot of the Sunne. And like another Phaeton consume In flames of all the world; a pile of Death Worthy the state, and greatnesse I haue lost. Or were I now but Lord of my owne fires, Wherein false Rome yet once againe might smoake, And perish, all vnpitied of her Gods, That all things in their last destruction might Performe a funerall honour to their Lord. O Ioue dissolue with CÃ¦sar, CÃ¦sars world; Or you whom Nero rather should inuoake Blacke Chaes, and you fearefull shapes beneath, That with a long, and not vaine enuy haue Sought to destroy this worke of th'other Gods; Now let your darkenesse cease the spoyles of day, And the worlds first contention end your strife. Enter two Romanes to him. 1 Rom: Though others, bound with greater benefits Haue left your changed fortunes and doe runne Whither new hopes doe call them, yet come we. Nero: O welcome, come you to aduersitie, Welcome true friends, why there is faith on earth. Of thousand seruants, friends, and followers; Yet two are left: your countenance me thinkes Giues comfort, and new hopes 2 Rom: Doe not deceiue your thoughts, My Lord we bring no comfort, would we could; But the last duty to performe, and best We euer shall, a free death to perswade, To cut off hopes of fearcer cruelty, And scorne, more cruell to a worthy soule. 1 Rom: The Senate haue decreed you're punishable, After the fashion of our ancestors; Which is; your necke being locked in a forke You must be naked whipt, and scourg'd to death. Nero: The Senate thus decreed? they that so oft My vertues flattered haue, and guifts of mine, My gouernment preferr'd to ancient times, And challenge Numa to compare with me; Haue they so horrible an end sought out? No, here I beare which shall preuent such shame, This hand shall yet from that deliuer me, And faithfull be alone vnto his Lord. Alasse how sharpe, and terrible is death; O must I die, must now my senses close, For euer die, and nere returne againe, Neuer more see the Sunne, nor Heauen, nor Earth? Whither goe I? what shall I be anone; What horred iourney wandrest thou my soule, Vnder th'earth, in darke, dampe, duskie vaults? Or shall I now to nothing be resolu'd? My feares become my hopes, O would I might.
