      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoke by Mr. PHOENIX. If Eyes which from a pious Sorrow flow, If Virtue struggling thro' a Length of Woe, Are Objects to demand a generous Tear, Who, Britons, shall deny the Tribute here? This Night our Bard on Homer builds his Fame: Who is not aw'd at that immortal Name! Our Scenes, in all the Pomp of Grief, disclose A Matron chaste, a Man of wond'rous Woes, A Heroe doom'd to change, when scarcely wed, For the rough Trade of War the bridal Bed; Thro' various Lands, and Men unknown, to roam, Far from his Soul's Delight, and native Home. From Perils great, hard Lot! to greater toss'd; Twenty long Years by adverse Fortune cross'd: Yet see him great above Afflictions rise; The Admiration of the brave and wise! Oh! ye bright Stars of Love! ye virtuous Fair! When you behold our widow'd Wife's Despair, When you behold her charming in Distress, All beauteous in her Negligence of Dress, Let a soft Tear adown your Roses steal, To shew Us what, by Sympathy, you feel. There was a Time, the Muses happyer Days, When all, in Sighs, confess'd the Poet's Praise. We want not living Chronicles to tell, When Belvedira dy'd, and Jaffeir fell, How Hearts of Heroes melted with Applause, And softest Bosoms heav'd in Jaffeir's Cause. The present Taste for Farce we would controul, And to kind Pity mold the generous Soul. When, in Distress, our virtuous Dame appears, Her Tresses loose, her Eyes bedew'd with Tears, Learn, Oh! ye Fair, learn from our lovely Wife, How to support, with Fame, a widow'd Life.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Penelope and Dol. Pen. How long, dear Dol, shall pensive Pen thus mourn Her absent Spouse, and hope his safe Return! Now more than nineteen rolling Years are pass'd, Since these fond Arms entwin'd my Soldier last. How hard is my uncommon Lot of Life, Uncertain if a Widow, or a Wife! And harder still, when scarce a Twelvemonth wed, To have my Husband ravish'd from my Bed! [Weeping. Dol. Madam, cheer up, and do not thus complain, For, as the Proverb says, to grieve is vain: Perhaps my Master's dead, if not, they say, A Woman need but seven Years to stay; Thrice seven Times almost the Sun his Race Has ran, since you beheld your Husband's Face; What then should hinder making You a Bride? Now certainly the Law is of your Side. Pen. Talk not of any Husband, Dol, to me, Far from my Thoughts be ev'ry one but he. Dol. But, Madam, do not wholly banish Joy; Be comforted, your Son's a hopeful Boy. Pen. O! Tele, Tele, when thy Face I view, Thy Father's Image does my Woes renew; While he's away what Comfort can I find? Nor Gin, nor Nantz, can ease a lovesick Mind. My Neighbour Limbeck has not in his Shop, Ah! Me! for Griefs like mine one cordial Drop. Dol. Then, if you please, I will to Gemmit's go; He has a Dram, I'm sure, will ease your Woe. Pen. Peace poor Adviser.—O! you silly Sow, Ha' done; and talk no more of drinking now. Dol. What if you dress, and go to see a Play? Henley and Violante act to-day. Pen. Dress! I cou'd almost throw my Cap away. She pulls off her Cap. SONG I. 1 Gently Dol, while I complain, With thy Mistress share her Grief, Let thy Counsel ease my Pain, Kindly bring Me some Relief, Not from Drams, or Plays, or Ale; Soothing Words will best prevail. 2 On the Flock-bed as I ly, Tossing, tumbling, to and fro, Wishing my Ulysses by, Hope but keeps awake my Woe. Think how dismal is my Life, Half a Widow, Half a Wife. I have not comb'd, this Month, these matted Locks, Nor, all this Quarter, worn but two clean Smocks. I live like any Hen pen'd up in Coop; You see I don't so much as wear a Hoop. Dol. Yet, Spite of all thy slattern Air, and Grace, The Men find Something pretty in thy Face. Pen. And what of that? Do'st think I'd be a Whore? Or do'st thou think Ulysses is no more? Dol. But, Madam, have you no Regard to Fame? Thimble and Hopkins will put in their Claim. Pen. To hear the Butcher too, Will Cleaver, bellow! Dol. Why, Cleaver's, 'faith, a very clever Fellow. SONG II. 1 He's tall and jolly, Believe thy Dolly, It wou'd be Folly, To slight his Pain. 2 He'll love Thee truely, And pay Thee duely What You from Uly Expect in vain. 3 He'll love Thee truely, And pay Thee duely What You from Uly Expect in vain. Pen. Why do these Rakehells thus disturb my Quiet? Why come they here to make this dayly Riot? Dol. They say your Promise they can ne'er forget, While you are weaving, Sooth, the Cabbage-net: You told them faithfully, when that is done, You'd give Yourself to Tom, to Will, or John. Pen. It is not finish'd yet, nor ever will, For the Day's Work the Night unravels still; Tell them from thence of Hopes they've not a Glimps; I made the Promise but to bite the Pimps: I can despise their Treats, their Stout, their Ale, Nor can their Hotpot, nor their Punch, prevail; But see, Tom Thimble comes, avoid the Place; I cannot bear that Pricklouse Raskal's Face. She goes out. SCENE II. Thimble enters, looking after Penelope. Thimb. Is Thimble ever thus condemn'd to burn Hot as his Goose, and meet with no Return? Cou'd'st thou but measure Half the Love I bear To Thee, my Suit wou'd well deserve thy Care. SONG III. 1 Forth from my Shopboard am I come, To try the Force of Love again; Poor Tom can neither work, nor keep at Home, Till Pen will deign to cure his distemper'd Brain. 2 O! Alas! I'm all forlorn, I am become the Neighbour's Scorn; Cleaver laughs, and Hopkins is full glad, To see their Rival Tom the Taylor mad. I own I am not made to coax and wheedle, But I'm as true as to the Pole the Needle. Stiffer than Buckram's thy obdurate Heart; And sharper than my Sheers is Cupid's Dart. Dol. Nay, Master Thimble, never thus complain, The Sheers but part, you know, to meet again. Thimb. Ah! Dol, thy Mistress shou'd not use Me ill, I love her more than Staytape in a Bill; And if she will not quickly be my Wife, Grief soon will snap my slender Thread of Life. Thimb. Ah! dearest Dol, wou'd you my Cause assist, You soon might do the Bus'ness,—if you list; But, O! I fear that, by your late Behaviour, The Bully Cleaver stands most in your Favour. Dol. Why truly Cleaver is a Man of Merit, And shews, in ev'ry Act, he wants no Spirit; For, if he's out of Pelf, he'll always bring A Sweetbread, or a Heart, or some such Thing; Therefore I must oblige him, for, you know, We Servants love a pretty Bit, or so. Thimb. Well, Dol, when you this silver Thimble see, Think of Tom Thimble; that is, think of me. Dol. 'Tis done.—This Present pays me well for speaking. [Aside. How can they say you Taylors all are sneaking! First go yourself, and boldly speak your Mind; She's in the Bar, or in the Room behind. Thimb. Love, Thimble, owns thy Pow'r where'er he goes! You scarcely give him Time to ty his Hose. [Thimble goes out, pulling up his Stockings. SCENE III. Hopkins enters, singing. Hopk. SONG IV. 1 God prosper long our noble King, Our Lives and Safetys all; While poor John Hopkins thou dost sing Of Pen, and sadly bawl. 2 Ah! well-a-day! what shall I do To gain Penelope? Did she but know my Love so true, I'm sure she'd pity me. I'm waxen old with Sorrow, more than Years, For ev'ry Night I bathe my Couch with Tears; Yet boots it little, Hopkins, to complain, Since eke thy Sorrows, and thy Tears, are vain; But hold.— [Seeing Dol. Fair Maiden 'tis for Thee I look: Accept this Present of a goodly Book. Dol. O! Nothing comes amiss. [Aside. You need not fear, You're always, Neighbour Hopkins, wellcome here. I never fail to speak a Word for you. Hopk. Then Dol in Church shall never want a Pew. [Hopkins goes out. SCENE IV. Dol. Well, Goodman Quaver, thou may'st go thy Ways; There is no Danger from thy Ekes and Ayes: Thus I may safely gull such Fools as you, Yet to my Cleaver, my belov'd, be true. SCENE V. Cleaver enters as from a Place where he stood concealed. Cleav. We thank Thee, Dol, we've seen Thee act thy Part, Well as becomes the Mistress of my Heart; Nor think thy Cleaver will ungrateful prove; We court the Mistress but the Maid we love. SONG V. 1 At Highgate tho I have been sworn; For such a Maid as Thee There's not a Mistress but I'd scorn, Of whatsoe'er Degree: You are, my Dear, my Soul's Delight, So prim, so gim, so clean, so tight, With your Fa, la, ra, la. Dol. And to thy Dol, while Cleaver is away, The shortest Moment is a livelong Day: And, trust me, I had rather, by my Life, Be Cleaver's Mistress than another's Wife. Cleav. And when I'm marry'd, trust me, by my Life, I'll use Thee as a Mistress, her a Wife; When I the Widow, and her Goods, possess, I'll see my Dolly in another Dress. [Chucking her under the Chin. Dol. Then haste, and beg, with Sighs, not to delay, Tell her you languish for the bridal Day. Cleav. Shall I my Fame with whining Sorrows stain, Whose Arms have Hecatombs of Oxen slain? Shall I fall on my Knees?—but 'tis no more, Than Butcher Hercules has done before; But lo! the Diff'rence great betwixt us twain; He felt the Passion that I only feign. Well, Dol, when I have pay'd my Vows to Pen— Dol. Then in my Garret we will meet at ten. SONG VI. [Dol.] I We there will laugh at those credulous Fools, For Lovers like Us the fittest Tools, Who beg, as for Life, for the Wedding-day, While we love on in the nat'ral Way. Cleav. II We want no Call but a beautyful Face, To fall on like those who ne'er wait for a Grace. Both. We want no Call but a beautyful Face, To fall on like those who ne'er wait for a Grace.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Scene changes, and discovers Ulysses, like a Beggar, in the Street, looking up for the Sign. Ulys. Yes, if my Eyes deceive me not, I see The royal Head, conspicuous in the Tree: Hail royal Suff'rer! Hail O! bless'd Domain! And shall Ulysses have his Pen again? O! Soul rejoice! O! Bosom banish Care! As Fame reports, she is as chaste as fair: I've heard her Story from a neighb'ring Friend; But why delay I to pursue my End? My Regimentals cover'd, this Disguise Unknown shall keep me to my Penne's Eyes; And this right Hand, that has a Halbert bore, Shall crave an Alms at its own Master's Door. SONG I. 1 O! pity the Heros of Six pence a Day, In War, or in Peace, how unhappy their Lives! Compel'd they are often by want of their Pay, To wheedle, to pilfer, and let out their Wives. When disbanded the Wretches to their Sorrow find true, That again, and again, they may plead for their Due, But are trusted by none, and reliev'd but by few. [He knocks at the Door. O! Pity an old Soldier's woeful Plight! SCENE II. Dol enters. Dol. Hey-days! a Beggar out so late at Night! You want to hide yourself, and pick the Locks; Be gone, or we shall have you in the Stocks. 'Tis this we owe to such a standing Crew Of Rogues in Red, who know not what to do In Times of Peace, but thus to beg, or steal: Wou'd I cou'd manage once the publick Weal! Ulys. Alas! young Woman, by your Looks, I see You never knew what 'twas to want like Me; But let me tell you, take it not amiss, I once have kept a House as good as this. Dol. You kept, you robb'd, a House; 'tis all a Flam. Don't tell Me what I was, but what I am. SONG II. 1 How idle the Notion of Birth and of Blood! Ev'ry House is but bad if its Purse is not good: Tho' all are descended you know from old Adam, Yet poor goody Poverty ne'er was call'd Madam. Derry, down, down, &amp;c. Ulys. Ah! [Shaking his Head, Dol. What, no farther yet; be gone, I say, Or I shall make you: where's our Dog? Hey Tray. SCENE III. Telemachus enters. Tel. Poor Man! have you no Bowels, Dol, nor Grace? Perhaps my Father's now in such a Case. Go mind your Guests. [Dol goes out. SCENE IV. See, poor old Soul! he crys; He almost draws the Tears from Tele's Eyes. [Aside. Come honest Man, don't mind that saucy Whore; Here, take this Half-penny; I wish 'twas more. Ulys. Ye Gods, what Words can now express my Joy, To see such early Virtues in my Boy! [Aside. O! Telemach! Tel. He knows my Name, do y' see! He certainly a Cunningman must be; I'll try him. [Aside. What's my Mother's Name? Ulys. 'Tis Pen; And mine Ulysses, happyest now of Men! I am thy Sire. Tel. I'm sure that cannot be. Ulys. I am thy Father, I, my Son, am he. By this Embrace— Tel. How shall I surely know? Ulys. You have, my Son, a Mole upon your Toe. Tel. That's true. Ulys. And farther, to suppress your Fear, See the King's Coat, 'tis the King's Coat I wear. He unbuttons his Beggar's Coat, and shews his Regimentals. I am a Serjeant still, no Beggar I, But thus I come your Mother's Faith to try; And next to rout the Scoundrels hence who woo her: Be secret for a While; and guide Me to her. Tel. SONG III. 1 O! Mother, O! Mother, no longer complain, Nor in your Distress bite the Sheets all in vain, My Father, my Father's come to you again. Which no Body can deny. SCENE V. Scene changes, and discovers Penelope alone reading; with a Pen, and Ink, by her. Pen. Shou'd this, Ulysses, greet Thee from thy Wife, Write not, but come, if you wou'd save her Life. One Day goes by, and Nothing sees but Grief, Another comes, and brings Me no Relief; Both Day and Night, I feel a Lover's Pain, And pray to Heav'n to bring my Man again. Whoever comes, and tells of Thee a Tale, Is sure to strike Me for a Pot of Ale. [She lays down the Letter. SONG IV. 1 Ye Winds be kind, and waft him to Me, Whose Sight alone can heal my Smart, In vain, in vain, these Scoundrels woo Me, To rob Ulysses of my Heart. 2 Perhaps, alas! press'd far away, he Now groans beneath the Musquet's Load; But in his March where'er he may be I wou'd partake the tedious Road. 3 O'er thirsty Plains, or snowy Mountains, With him an humble Slave I'd go, To quench his Thirst I'd seek the Fountains, Or chafe his Limbs o'er Hills of Snow. 4 But, O! O! O! O! O! O! O! O! By Hunger forc'd to be a Thief, He to the Wreck, perhaps, must go, go, While here his Wife will dy with Grief. SCENE VI. Ulysses and Telemachus enter. Ulys. You've hear'd enough: You are prepar'd you say. [To Telemachus. Tel. I am. Egad, this is a happy Day. [Shruging his Shoulders. They come forward, and Telemachus speaks to Penelope. Tel. Mother, if you're at Leisure to be seen, Here's an old Soldier, that has serv'd the Queen, In Flanders; one who knew my Father well, And of him many wond'rous Things can tell. Pen. Rising. If, honest Man, you my Ulysses know, Where did you see him, and how long ago? But tell no Lys, if you my Friendship wish. Ulys. Ah! Madam, does a Beggar know his Dish? Yes, we were Comrades all the War in Spain, And then in Flanders many a long Campaign. We shar'd our Dangers, and we shar'd our Bed; One Pocket serv'd Us, and one Table fed. These Eyes can witness what his Arms atchiev'd, What of a Serjeant scarce can be believ'd! Such Acts, as had our Gazetteer but known, His Paper had been fill'd with them alone. Pen. The War concluded, whither did he roam, And what has kept him from his Wife, and Home? O! tell Me what did the dear Man befall; For I'm on Tiptoe till I hear it all. Ulys. At Rotterdam, the Devil damn the Place, Was where I last beheld my Comrade's Face; One Circe there, a Witch that deals in Gin, By magic Spells had drawn the Serjeant in. Pen. What do I hear? Curse on the dirty Punk; Then ev'ry Night with her I war'nt he's drunk. Rather than hear'd it wou'd I'd lost my Life: And has Ulysses then forgot his Wife! [She weeps. Ulys. Have Patience, when he once has broke her Charms, Nothing can long detain him from your Arms. Think him not false, for, if I know him right, Of You he thinks by Day, and dreams by Night. I've hear'd him cry, amidst a thousand Men, O! happy! happy! cou'd I see my Pen! Pen. Then I'm reviv'd indeed, if he is true.— He was, I think, bating his Age, like You. Ulys. Turning away. O! how I long! but must not yet reveal.— Pen. Following him. Come, you have Something that you wou'd conceal. Walk in with Me, and drink a Cup of Ale, And there pursue the Remnant of your Tale. SONG V. [Pen.] How great is the Anguish, To pine, and to languish, For an absent Swain, For an absent Swain! Ulys. The greater the Pleasure, When you meet your Treasure, Not to part again. Both. How sweet is the Pleasure, To possess our Treasure, After all our Pain! [They go out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Penelope and Ulysses. Pen. If there is Ought besides my House affords, Call for it freely, Friend, and make no Words. No longer meanly beg from Door to Door, You're welcome here upon my Husband's Score. Ulys. I doubly thank you for this Bounty shown, Both on my Friend's Account, and on my own. O! how I'm pleas'd to see such Virtues wait On one who lives in such an humble State! How few, alas! the Wives of high Degree, Who live to Rules of Abstinence like Thee! For twenty Years can keep their nuptial Vows, And present Lovers slight for absent Spouse! You mind your household Cares, attend your Trade, Nor ever think upon the Masquerade, Oblige your Customers, can make a Bill, And waste no Time at Ombre or Quadrille. SCENE II. Enter Cleaver, Thimble, and Hopkins. Cleav. So, Widow, have you got a Conj'rer here? Well, does he tell you that your Wedding's near? To Ulysses. Come, tell us, Sydrophel, what say the Skys; For by your Beard you shou'd be wondrous wise. Ulys. Thus say the Stars, if I can read them right, One here will share her Bed to-morrow Night. Pen. Old Hypocrite! are you the Serjeant's Friend? Hopk. Have Patience, Widow, till you see the End; Whoever is decreed, it must be so, For Matches all are made in Heav'n you know. Cleav. Come, next, old Hocus, tell Us, if you can,— Thimb. Ay, tell Us, Master Conjurer, the Man. Ulys. I'll tell ye all, but in another Place; It is not proper here before her Face. Cleav. Then follow Us, Cleaver will lead the Way: Widow, to-morrow is to be the Day: SONG I. The Day that shall cure The Pains you endure, By making a Spouse of your Pillow, To Will Cleaver's Arms Shall give all your Charms, To Thimble and Hopkins the Willow, Poor Culls, To Thimble and Hopkins the Willow. All go out but Pen. SCENE III. Pen. How shall I rid Me of this hect'ring Blade? If I affront him I shall spoil my Trade: Marry I cannot, will not; what to do I know not; I'm distracted. SCENE IV. Minerva descends in Thunder and Lightening. Penelope screams. Pen. Ho! ho! ho! Min. Zoons, what the Devil puts you in a Fright? Is your old Friend Minerva such a Sight? Pen. O! save Me Heav'n, I cannot bear the Light! [Hiding her Face. Min. Madam, 'tis I, 'tis Pallas; never wonder.— Put out your Light'ning there, and hush your Thunder. Pen. What brings your Highness here? Min. Why, what d'you think? To see my Tele, and to taste your Drink. Among the Gods I've often heard it spoke, We've no such Beer, as at the Royal Oak. A double Dabber. [She knocks with her Spear. Pen. Hold, poor Dol, I fear, Wou'd swoon away to see your Highness here; I'll therefore go myself. Excuse Me, pray. [She Courtesys as she goes out. Min. No Ceremony: go, but do not stay. SCENE V. A Noise of fighting from within. Min. Hark, just as I inspir'd the Fight's begun: Now for Ulysses, and his hopeful Son. SONG II. 1 Thus having slid from th'azure Sky To see what on Earth is doing, By Jove I'll make these Varlets fly, And quickly spoil their wooing. 2 A Cuckold's a Name for a Fool or a Cit, But sure the Goddess of Wisdom Will never let Ulysses be bit, Nor suffer such Shame for his Doom. SCENE VI. Penelope enters, spilling the Drink down her Apron as she comes in. Pen. Lud, I'm so frighted, there is such a Clatter. Pray cou'd your Highness tell Me what's the Matter? They all are fighting, and have lock'd the Door: And certainly I hear Will Cleaver roar. [A Noise from within. Min. You're right; they all are at it now Pelmel. Well play'd Ulysses faith; have at them Tel. Pen. Falling on her Knees. What can your Highness mean? Pray tell Me true; I do intreat you by those Eyes so blue. Min. I'll tell Thee all; but Nothing rashly.—Drink. Ulysses soon shall make these Scoundrels stink. Penelope rises, and drinks to Minerva, who takes the Pot from her after she has drank. Min. Pen, you and I have long Acquaintance been.— Come, here's Success to the good Man within. [She drinks. Pen. Pray— Min. Hear me out.—I am your House's Friend; I guard your Honour, and your Beer commend. You well remember, when the War begun, Your Husband left you with an only Son. Him to the School of Charity I sent, Where soon he learn'd to read, and fast in Lent. Bless'd Institution! happy Project! whence The Poor are Scholars made without Expence; Whence many an honest Peasant's Son may grow A rev'rend Lump, and scorn his Father's Plow. 'Twas I myself inspir'd the Notion first; Let any speak against it if they durst: Pleas'd the Success great Jove, my Father, sees; A Fiddle for the Fable of the Bees! Pen. All that your Highness says, indeed, is true; But pray now, Madam, what is that to Ulysses? Min. Be still, I say, and hear Me out.— Fool, 'tis Ulysses that makes all this Rout.— What, you're uneasy to be gone.—Stand still.— Zoons, ben't so eager; you shall have your Fill.— 'Twas he that made the Dog, Will Cleaver, roar; He bang'd him well, and made him pay his Score. To do him Justice, Tele top'd his Part; He pinch'd the Taylor till he made him smart: And as for Cleaver's Trull, your saucy Maid, She shall mill Neckweed for the Pranks she play'd. My Husband.—I'm impatient.—Let Me fly. Min. Stay.— [Holding her. Pen. Not for all the Ladys of the Sky. SCENE VII. She runs out at one Door; and Ulysses enters at the other, in his Serjeant's Coat, beating the Wooers cross the Stage. Cleav. Good Master Serjeant be n't in such a Passion. [Ulysses strikes him under the Ribs. Zoons, there's a Stota.—Have you no Compassion! Minerva whispers Ulysses and Telemachus, to encourage them, while Cleaver clinches his Fist in order to strike; but Ulysses prevents him by triping up his Heels. Min. Tip him the Flying-horse, or, if he reels, Throw the Cross-buttock, and trip up his Heels. Cleav. 'Sblud, I shall fly the Pit, and stay no longer; The more he fights, I think, he grows the stronger. He rises, and runs out. While Ulysses is beating off Cleaver, and Telemachus pinching Thimble, Hopkins creeps out. Thimb. Nay, Master Tel, I'm not a Match for you.— I'm sure you've pinch'd Me almost black and blue. [He goes out. SCENE VIII. Ulys. We thank your Highness for this Service done.— This is my old Friend Pallas; kneel my Son. [They both kneel. Min. Ulysses rise from off your Marrow-bones; Rise Tel; you'll hurt yourselves against the Stones. [They rise. Min. I ne'er forget you: I've been here this Hour. Ulys. We know it Goddess; for we felt your Pow'r. Min. To all but you invisible I've been; Too pure by vulgar Mortals to be seen; But yet the Rogues confess'd Me, in their Fright, Like Dogs which howl when Spirits walk the Night. Ulys. To you, great Patroness, I owe my Life. Min. Well, say no more.—Go in, and kiss your Wife. Ulys. But see, she comes, flush'd with immortal Grace, And like a Goddess blooming is her Face; [Turning to Minerva. She by thy Influence seems new Life to gain, And I'm inspir'd with a sublimer Strain. Approach Me Pen, and open all thy Charms, SCENE IX. Penelope enters. And let thy Uly rush into thy Arms. [They embrace. Marlbro' I envy not thy mighty Name, Eternal Glory thine, give Me my Dame. SONG III. Pen. My Sorrows are pass'd, I've got him at last, For whom all my Tears have been flowing, Ulys. Feel, feel, my Heart beat, To ly at your Feet, Such Joys to this Meeting are owing. Pen. Rosin come hither, And Neighbours together To our second Wedding be flocking. Ulys. Come Rosin, and play While they dance it away; And then they shall all throw the Stocking. Chorus. Come Rosin, and play While they dance it away, And then they shall all throw the Stocking. [After all have sung the Chorus to the Musick, a Dance begins; and Minerva, Ulysses, and Penelope join in the Hay; which being over, Minerva comes forward, and speaks the Epilogue.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Well, I suppose, good Folks, you're all agogue, To hear a Goddess speak an Epilogue. My Bus'ness now is to defend the Poet; But I can scarce persuade myself to do it: Defend him? Why? Because he brought me here, To rant, to swagger, and to call for Beer. It is a Trick the Puppy learn'd at School, To make Us shew our Shapes, and play the Fool; But, as I scorn, I can forgive the Chit; Poor Thing, he did it but to shew his Wit; On such like Errands oft' we've been before, From Homer, Lucan, and a Dozen more; For when the Muse, forsooth, begins to jade, Whip, snap, a Goddess is her waiting Maid; And, when we've done the Bus'ness of the Day, We take a Cloud for Heav'n, and post away. The END.</field>
