      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. To such (and some there are, no question here,) Who happy in their memories do bear This Subject long since acted, and can say Truly, we have seen something like this Play. Our Author with becoming Modesty (For in this kinde he ne'er was bold) by me, In his defence, thus answers, By command He undertook this task, nor could it stand With his love Fortune to refuse to do; What by his Patron he was call'd unto. For whose delight and yours, we hope, with care He hath review'd it; and with him we dare Maintain to any man, that did allow 'Twas good before, it is much better'd now; Nor is it sure against the Proclamation, To raise new Piles upon an old Foundation, So much to them deliver'd; to the rest, To whom each scene is fresh, he doth protest, Should his Muse fail now a fair flight to make, He cannot fancy what will please, or take.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Scæn. 1. Enter Pedro and Leonora. Ped. My worthiest Mistress! this day cannot end But prosperous to Pedro, that begins With this so wish'd encounter. Leo. Only, Servant, To give you thanks in your own Courtly language, Would argue me more ceremonious Then heartily affected; and you are Too well assur'd, or I am miserable, Our equal loves have kept one rank too long To stand at distance now. Ped. You make me happy In this so wise reproof, which I receive As a chaste favor from you, and will ever Hold such a strong command o're my desires, That though my Blood turn Rebel to my Reason, I never shall presume to seek ought from you, But what (your honor safe) you well may grant me, And Vertue sign the Warrant. Leo. Your love to me So limited, will still preserve your Mistress Worthy her servant, and in your restraint Of loose affections, bind me faster to you: But there will be a time when we may welcome Those wish'd for pleasures, as Heavens greatest blessings; When that the Vice-roy your most noble father, And the Duke my uncle, and to that, my Guardian, Shall by their free consent confirm them lawful. Ped. You ever shall direct, and I obey you: Is my sister stirring yet? Leo. Long since. Ped. Some business With her, join'd to my service to your self, Hath brought me hither; pray you vouchsafe the favor T'acquaint her with so much. Leo. I am prevented. Enter Almira and two women. Alm. Do the rest here; my Cabinet is too hot, This room is cooler. Brother! Ped. 'Morrow sister, Do I not come unseasonably? Al. Why good brother? Ped. Because you are not yet fully made up, Nor fit for visitation. There are Ladies And great ones, that will hardly grant access On any terms to their own Fathers, as They are themselves, nor willingly be seen Before they have ask'd councel of their Doctor, How the Cervize will appear, newly laid on When they ask blessing. Al. Such indeed there are That would be still young, in despight of time, That in the wrinkled winter of their age Would force a seeming April of fresh beauty, As if it were within the power of art To frame a second nature: But for me, And for your Mistress, I dare say as much; The faces, and the teeth you see, we slept with. Ped. Which is not frequent, sister, with some Ladies. Al. You spie no sign of any night,— Mask here, (Tie on my Carkanet) nor does your nosthril Take in the scent of strong perfumes, to stifle The sourness of our breaths as we are fasting: You are in a Ladies chamber, gentle Brother, And not in your Apothecaries shop. We use the women, you perceive, that serve us, Like servants, not like such as do create us: 'Faith search our pockets, and if you find there Comfits of Amber-greece to help our kisses, Conclude us faulty. Ped. You are pleasant, sister. And I am glad to find you so dispos'd, You will the better hear me. Al. What you please, Sir. Ped. I am entreated by the Prince of Tarent Don John Antonio. Al. Would you would choose Some other subject. Ped. Pray you give me leave, For his desires are fit for you to hear, As for me to prefer. This Prince of Tarent (Let it not wrong him, that I call him friend) Finding your choice of Don Cardenes lik'd of By both your fathers, and his hopes cut off, Resolves to leave Palermo. Al. He does well, That I hear gladly. Ped. How this Prince came hither, How bravely furnish'd, how attended on, How he hath borne himself here, with what charge He hath continued; his magnificence In costly Banquets, curious Masques, rare Presents, And of all sorts, you cannot but remember. Al. Give me my Gloves. Ped. Now, for reward of all His cost, his travel, and his dutious service, He does intreat that you will please he may Take his leave of you, and receive the favor Of kissing of your hands. Al. You are his friend, And shall discharge the part of one to tell him That he may spare the trouble; I desire not To see, or hear more of him. Ped. Yet grant this, Which a meer stranger in the way of Courtship Might challenge from you. Al. And obtain it sooner. Ped. One reason for this would do well. Al. My will Shall now stand for a thousand; shall I lose The priviledge of my sex, which is my Will, To yield a Reason like a man? or you Deny your Sister that which all true women Claim as their first prerogative, which Nature Gave to them for a law? and should I break it, I were no more a woman. Ped. Sure a good one You cannot be, if you put off that vertue Which best adorns a good one, Courtesie And affable behaviour. Do not flatter Yourself with the opinion that your birth, Your beauty, or whatever false ground else You raise your pride upon, will stand against The censure of just men. Al. Why let it fall then, I still shall be unmov'd. Leo. And pray you be you so. Al. What Jewel's that? Wo. That which the Prince of Tarent— Al. Left here, and you receiv'd without my knowledge; I have use of't now. Does the Page wait without, My Lord Cardenes sent t'enquire my health? Wo. Yes Madam. Al. Give it him, and with it pray him To return my service to his Lord, and mine. Ped. Will you so undervalue one that has So truly lov'd you, to bestow the pledge Of his affection (being a Prince) upon The servant of his Rival? Leo. 'Tis not well, 'Faith, were it Lady? send gold to the Boy, 'Twill please him better. Al. Do as I command you, I will keep nothing that may put me in mind Don John Antonio ever lov'd, or was, Being wholly now Cardenes. Ped. In another This were meer barbarism, sister, and in you (For I'll not sooth you) at the best 'tis rudeness. Al. Rudeness? Ped. Yes rudeness, and what's worse, the want Of civil manners, nay ingratitude Unto the many and so fair deservings Of Don Antonio: does this express Your breeding in the Court, or that you call The Vice-roy father? A poor peasants daughter That ne'r had conversation but with beasts (Or men bred like them) would not so far shame Her education. Al. Pray you leave my chamber; I know you for a Brother, not a Tutor. Leo. You are too violent, Madam. Al. Were my Father Here to command me, (as you take upon you Almost to play his part) I would refuse it. Where I love, I profess it; where I hate, In every circumstance I dare proclaim it: Of all that wear the shapes of men, I loath That Prince you plead for; no antipathie Between things most averse in nature, hold A stronger enmity then his with mine: With which rest satisfied; if not, your anger May wrong your self, not me. Leo. My Lord Cardenes! Ped. Go; in soft terms, If you persist thus, You will be one. Al. What one? pray you out with it: Ped. Why, one that I shall wish a stranger to me, That I might curse you: but— Enter Martino. Mar. Whence grows this heat? Ped. Be yet advis'd, and entertain him fairly, For I will send him to you, or no more Know me a Brother. Al. As you please. Ped. Good morrow. Exit. Mar. Good morrow, and part thus? you seem mov'd too: What desperate fool durst raise a tempest here To sink himself? Al. Good sir, have patience; The cause (though I confess I am not pleas'd) No way deserves your anger: Mar. Not mine, Madam? As if the least offence could point at you, And I not feel it: As you have vouchsaf'd me The promise of your heart, conceal it not, Whomsoever it concerns. Al. It is not worth So serious an enquiry: My kind Brother Had a desire to learn me some new Courtship Which I distasted, that was all. Mar. Your Brother, In being yours, with more security He might provoke you; yet if he hath past A Brothers bounds— Leo. What then, my Lord? Mar. Believe it, I'll call him to accompt for't. Leo. Tell him so. Al. No more. Leo. Yes, thus much; though my modesty Be call'd in question for it, in his absence I will defend him: He hath said nor done But what Don Pedro well might say or do. Mark me, Don Pedro! in which understand As worthy, and as well as can be hop'd for Of those that love him best, from Don Cardenes. Mar. This to me Cousin? Al. You forget your self. Leo. No, nor the cause, in (which you did so Lady) Which is so just, that it needs no concealing On Pedro's part. Al. What mean you. Leo. I dare speak it, If you dare hear it, Sir: He did perswade Almira, your Almira, to vouchsafe Some little conference with the Prince of Tarent Before he left the Court; and that the world Might take some notice, though he prosper'd not In his so lov'd design, he was not scorn'd, He did desire the kissing of her hand, And then to leave her; this was much: Mar. 'Twas more Then should have been urg'd by him, well deni'd On your part, Madam, and I thank you for't. Antonio had his answer, I your grant: And why your Brother should prepare for him An after enterview, or private favor, I can finde little reason. Leo. None at all. Why you should be displeas'd with't. Mar. His respect To me, as things now are, should have weigh'd down His former friendship, 'twas done indiscreetly, I would be loth to say maliciously, To build up the demolish'd hopes of him That was my Rival: What had he to do (If he view not my happiness in your favor, With wounded eies) to take upon himself An office so distasteful? Leo. You may ask As well, what, any Gentleman has to do With civil courtesie. Al. Or you with that, Which at no part concerns you: Good my Lord Rest satisfied, that I saw him not, nor will. And that, nor Father, Brother, nor the world Can work me unto any thing, but what You give allowance too; in which assurance With this, I leave you. Leo. Nay take me along, You are not angry too? Al. Presume on that. Exeunt: Mar: Am I assur'd of her, and shall again Be tortur'd with suspition to loose her. Before I have enjoy'd her? the next Sun Shall see her mine; why should I doubt then? yet To doubt is safer, then to be secure But one short day: Great Empires in less time Have suffer'd change; she's constant, but a woman, And what a lovers vows, perswasions, tears, May in a minute work upon such frailty. There are too many, and too sad examples. The Prince of Tarent gone, all were in safety; Or not admitted to solicite her, My fears would quit me; 'tis my fault, if I Give way to that, and let him ne'er desire To own what's hard, that dares not guard it. Who waits there? Enter Servants and Page. Serv. Would your Lordship might? Mar. 'Tis well You are so neer. Enter Don John, and Servant. John. Take care all things be ready For my remove. Serv. They are. Mar. We meet like Friends, No more like Rivals now: my emulation Puts on the shape of love and service to you. John. It is return'd. Mar. 'Twas rumor'd in the Court You were to leave the City, and that wan me To find you out: Your Excellence may wonder That I that never saw you till this hour, But that I wish'd you dead, so willingly Should come to wait upon you to the Ports, And there, with hope you never will look back, Take my last farewell of you. John. Never look back? Mar. I said so, neither is it fit you should; And may I prevail with you as a friend, You never shall, nor while you live hereafter Think of the Viceroy's Court, or of Palermo, But as a grave, in which the Prince of Tarent Buried his honor. John. You speak in a language I do not understand. Mar. No? I'll be plainer. What mad-man, that came hither with that pomp Don John Antonio did, that exact Courtier Don John Antonio, with whose brave fame only Great Princesses have faln in love, and dy'd; That came with such assurance as young Paris Did to fetch Helen, being sent back, contemn'd, Disgrac'd and scorn'd, his large expence laugh'd at, His bravery scoff'd, the Lady that he courted Left quietly in possession of another (Not to be nam'd that day a Courtier Where he was mention'd, the scarce known Cardenes, And he to bear her from him) that would ever Be seen again (having got fairly off) By such as will live ready witnesses Of his repulse, and scandal? John. The grief of it, Believe me, will not kill me. All mans honor Depends not on the most uncertain favor Of a fair Mistris. Mar. Troth, you bear it well. You should have seen some that were sensible Of a disgrace, that would have rag'd, and sought To cure their honor, with some strange revenge: But you are better temper'd; and they wrong The Neapolitans in their report, That say they are fiery spirits, uncapable Of the least injury, dangerous to be talk'd with After a loss, where nothing can move you. But, like a Stoick, with a constancy, Words nor affronts, can shake, you still go on And smile when men abuse you. John. If they wrong Themselves, I can: yet I would have you know, I dare be angry. Mar. 'Tis not possible. A taste of't would do well: And I'd make tryal What may be done. Come hither Boy, you have seen This Jewel, as I take it. John. Yes, 'tis that I gave Almira. Mar. And in what esteem She held it, coming from your worthy self, You may perceive, that freely hath bestowed it Upon my Page. John. When I presented it, I did not indent with her, to what use She should employ it. See the kindness of A loving soul; who, after this neglect, Nay gross contempt, will look again upon her, And not be frighted from it. John. No indeed Sir, Nor give way longer: Give way, do you mark, To your loose wit, to run the Wilde-goose chace, Six syllables further: I will see the Lady, That Lady, that dotes on you, from whose hate My love increases, though you stand elected Her Porter, to deny me. Mar. Sure you will not. John. Yes, instantly: Your prosperous success Hath made you insolent; and for her sake I have thus long forborne you; and can yet Forget it, and forgive it, ever provided, That you end here, and for what is past recalling, That she make intercession for your pardon, Which at her suit, I'll grant. Mar. I am much unwilling To move her for a triffle; bear that too, And then she shall speak to you. John. Men and Angels, Take witness for me, that I have endur'd More then a man:—O do not fall so soon, Stand up; take my hand, so: When I have printed For ever contumelious word, a wound here, Then sink for ever. Mar. O! I suffer justly. Serv. Murther, murther, murther. Exe. Servants. 2 Serv. Apprehend him. 3 Serv. We'll all joyn with you. John. I do wish you more, My fury will be lost else, if it meet not Matter to work on; one life is too little For so much injury. Enter Almira, Leonora, Servants. Al. O my Cardenes, Thou dead, still my Cardenes: Villains, cowards, What do ye check at? can one arm, and that A murtherers, so long guard the curs'd Master, Against so many swords, made sharp with Justice? 1. Serv. Sure he will kill us all; he is a devil. 2. Serv. He is invulnerable. Al. Your base fears Beget such fancies in you: Give me a sword, This my weak arm, made strong in my revenge, Shall force a way to't. John. Would it were deeper Madam, The thrust; which I would not put by, being yours Of greater force, to have peirc'd through that heart Which still retains your figure: Weep still Lady, For every tear that flows from those griev'd eyes, Some part of that which maintains life, goes from me. And so to die, were in a gentle slumber To pass to Paradise; but you envy me So quiet a departure from my world, My world of miseries; therefore take my sword, And having kill'd me with it, cure the wounds It gave Cardenes. Enter Pedro. Ped. 'Tis too true: Was ever Valor so ill employ'd? John. Why stay you Lady? Let not soft pity work on your hard nature: You cannot do a better office to The dead Cardenes, and I willingly Shall fall a ready sacrifice, to appease him, Your fair hand offering it. Al. Thou couldst ask nothing But this, which I would grant: Lev. Flint-hearted Lady! Ped. Are you a woman, Sister? Al. Thou art not A Brother, I renounce that title to thee: Thy hand is in this bloody act; 'twas this For which that savage homicide was sent hither. Thou equal Judge of all things, if that blood, And innocent blood— Al. Oh Cardenes, How is my soul rent between rage and sorrow, That it can be, that such an upright Cedar Should violently be torn up by the roots, Without an earthquake in that very moment To swallow them that did it. John. The hurt's nothing, But the deep wound is in my conscience, friend, Which sorrow in death only can recover. Ped. Have better hopes. Enter Viceroy, Messina, Captain, Guard, and Servants. Mess. My son, is this the marriage I came to celebrate? false hopes of man, I come to find a grave here. Al. I have wasted My stock of Tears, and now just Anger help me To pay in my Revenge the other part Of duty which I owe thee. O great Sir, Not as a Daughter now, but a poor Widow, Made so before she was a Bride, I flie To your impartial justice; the offence Is death, and death in his most horrid form: Let not then title, or a Princes name (Since a great crime is in a great man greater) Secure the Offender: Mess. Give me life for life, As thou wilt answer it to the great King Whose Deputy thou art here. Al. And speedy Justice. Mess. Put the damn'd wretch to torture. Al. Force him to Reveal his curs'd Confederates, which spare not, Although you find a Son among them. Vice. How? Mess. Why bring you not the Rack forth? Al. Wherefore stands the Murtherer unbound? Vice. Shall I have hearing? Mess. Excellent Lady, in this you express Your true love to the dead. Al. All love to mankind from me, ends with him. Vice. Will you hear me yet? And first to you; you do confess the fact With which you stand charg'd? John. I will not make worse What is already ill, with vain denial. Vice. Then understand, though you are Prince of Tarent, Yet being a Subject to the King of Spain, No priviledge of Sicily can free you Being convict by a just form of Law, From the municipal Statutes of that Kingdom, But as a common man, being found guilty, Must suffer for it. John. I prize not my life So much, as to appeal from any thing You shall determine of me. Vice. Yet despair not To have an equal hearing; the exclaims Of this griev'd Father, nor my Daughters tears Shall sway me from my self; and where they urge To have you tortur'd, or led bound to prison, I must not grant it. Mess. No? Vice. I cannot sir; For men of his rank are to be distinguish'd From other men, before they are condemn'd, From which (his cause not heard) he yet stands free: So take him to your charge, and as your life See he be safe. Capt. Let me die for him else. Exe. Ped. John, Cap. &amp; guard. Mess. The guard of him should have been given to me. Al. Or unto me. Mess. Bribes may corrupt the Captain. Al. And our just wreak, by force or cunning practice, With scorn prevented. Mar. Oh! Al. What groan is that? Vice: They'r apparent signs of life yet in him. Al. Oh that there were! that I could pour my blood Into his veins! Mar. Oh, oh! Vice. Take him up gently. Mess. Run for Physitians. Al. Surgeons. Mess. All helps else. Vice. This care of his recovery, timely practis'd, Would have express'd more of a Father in you, Then your impetuous clamors for revenge. But I shall find fit time to urge that further Hereafter to you; 'tis not fit for me To add weight to oppress'd calamitie. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Scæn. 1. Enter Pedro, Don John, Captain. John. Why should your love to me, having already So oft endur'd the test, be put unto A needless trial? have you not long since In every circumstance and rite of friendship Outgone all presidents the Antients boast of, And will you yet move further? Ped. Hitherto I have done nothing (howsoe'r you value My weak endeavours) that may justly claim A title to your friendship, and much less Laid down the debt, which as a tribute due To your deservings, not I, but mankind Stands bound to tender. John. Do not make an Idol Of him that should, and without superstition, To you build up an Altar. O my Pedro, When I am to expire, to call you mine Assures a future happiness: Give me leave To argue with you, and the fondness of Affection struck blind, with justice hear me. Why should you, being innocent, fling your life Into the furnace of your fathers anger For my offence? Or take it granted, (yet 'Tis more then supposition) you prefer My safety 'fore your own, (so prodigally You waste your favors) wherfore should this Captain His blood and sweat rewarded in the favor Of his great Master, falsifie the trust Which from true judgment he reposes in him, For me a stranger? Ped. Let him answer that, He needs no prompter: Speak your thoughts, and freely: Capt. I ever lov'd to do so, and it shames not The bluntness of my breeding; from my youth I was train'd up a Soldier, one of those That in their natures love the dangers more Then the rewards of danger. I could add, My life, when forfeited, the Viceroy pardon'd, But by his intercession; and therefore It being lent by him, I were ungrateful (Which I will never be) if I refus'd To pay that debt at any time demanded. Ped. I hope, friend, this will satisfie you. John. No, it raises More doubts within me. Shall I from the school Of gratitude, in which this Captain reads The text so plainly, learn to be unthankful? Or viewing in your actions the Idea Of perfect Friendship, when it does point to me How brave a thing it is to be a Friend, Turn from the object? Had I never lov'd The fair Almira for her outward features, Nay, were the beauties of her mind suspected, And her contempt and scorn painted before me, The being your Sister would anew inflame me With much more impotence to dote upon her: No, dear friend, let me in my death confirm (Though you in all things else have the precedence) I'll die ten times, ere one of Pedro's hairs Shall suffer in my cause. Ped. If you so love me, In love to that part of my soul dwels in you, (For though two bodies, friends have but one soul.) Loose not both life and me. Enter a Servant. 1. Serv. The Prince is dead. Exit. John. If so, shall I leave Pedro here to answer For my escape? As thus I clasp thee, let The Vice-roys sentence finde me. Ped. Flie for Heavens sake, Consider the necessity; though now We part Anthonio we, may meet again; But death's division is for ever, friend. Enter another Servant. 2. Serv. The rumor spread Sir, of Martino's death, Is check'd, there's hope of his recovery. John. Why should I flie then? when I may enjoy With mine own life, my friend. Ped. That's still uncertain, He may have a relapse; for once be rul'd friend. He's a good debtor that pays when 'tis due; A prodigal, that before it is requir'd, Makes tender of it. Enter three or four Sailors. 1. Sail. The Bark, Sir, is ready. 2. Sail. The wind sits fair. Whistles within. 3. Sail. Heaven favors your escape. Cap. Hark how the Boatswain whistles you aboard. Will nothing move you? John. Can I leave my friend? Pedro. I must delay no longer, force him home. Capt. I'll run the hazard of my fortunes with you. John. What violence is this? hear but my Reasons. Pedro. Poor friendship that is cool'd with Arguments. Away, away. Capt. For Malta. Pedro. You shall hear All our events. John. I may sail round the world, But never meet thy like. Pedro. Pedro. Anthonio. John. I breathe my soul back to thee. Pedro. In exchange Bear mine along with thee. Capt. Cheerly my hearts. Exeunt. Ped. He's gone, May pittying-Heaven his Pilot be, And then I weigh not what becomes of me. Exit. Enter Viceroy, Messina, and Attendants. Vice. I tell you right Sir. Mes. Yes, like a rough Surgeon, Without a feeling in your self, you search My wounds unto the quick, then pray declare The tediousness, and danger of the cure, Never remembring what the Patient suffers. But you preach this Philosophy to a man That does pertake of passion, and not To a dull Stoick. Vice. I confess you have Just cause to mourn your Son; and yet if reason Cannot yeeld comfort, let example cure. I am a Father too, my onely daughter As dear in my esteem, perhaps as worthy As your Martino, in her love to him As desperately ill, either's loss equal, And yet I bear it with a better temper. Enter Pedro. Pedro. Which if you please to imitate 'twill not wrong Your pietie, nor your judgment. Mes. We were fashion'd in different moulds, I weep with mine own eyes Sir, pursue my ends too, Pitie to you's a Cordial, Revenge to me, and that I must, and will have If my Martino die. Pedro. Your must, and will, Shall in your full sail'd confidence deceive you. Lord. Hear's Doctor Paulo Sir. Enter Doctor Paulo, two Surgeons. Mes. My hand? you rather Deserve my knee, and it shall bend as to A second Father, if your saving aids Restore my son. Vice. 'Rise thou bright star of knowledge, The honor of thy art, thou help of nature, Thou glory of our Academies. Doct. If I blush Sir To hear these attributes ill plac'd on me, It is excusable. I am no God Sir, Nor holy Saint that can do miracles, But a weak sinful man: Yet that I may In some proportion deserve these favors, Your excellencies please to grace me with, I promise all the skill I have acquir'd In simples, or the careful observation Of the superior Bodies, with my judgment Deriv'd from long experience, stand ready To do you service. Mes. Modestly repli'd. Vice. How is it with you princely Patient? Mes. Speak, But speak some comfort Sir. Doct. I must speak truth, His wounds, though many, Heaven so guided yet Anthonio's sword, it pierc'd no part was mortal. These Gentlemen who worthily deserve The names of Surgeons, have done their duties: The means they practis'd, not ridiculous charms To stop the blood; no Oyls, nor Balsoms bought Of cheating Quack-salvers, or Montebanks, By them appli'd: The rules by Chiron taught, And Æsculapius, which drew upon him, The thunderers envy, they with care pursu'd, Heav'n prospering their endeavors. Mes. There is hope then Of his recovery? Doct. But no assurance; I must not flatter you. That little air Of comfort that breathes towards us (for I dare not Rob these t'inrich my self) you ow their care; For yet I have done nothing. Mes. Still more modest, I will begin with them, to either give Three thousand crowns. Vice. I'll double your reward; See 'em paid presently. 1. Surg. This magnificence With equity, cannot be confer'd on us; 'Tis due unto the Doctor. 2: Surg. True; we were But his subordinate ministers, and did onely Follow your grave directions. Doct. 'Tis your own, I challenge no part in it. Vice. Brave on both sides. Doct. Deserve this, with the honor that will follow In your attendance. 2. Surg. If both sleep at once, 'Tis justice both should die. Exeunt Surgeons: Mes. For you grave Doctor, We will not in such petty sums consider Your high desarts. Our treasury lies open, Command it as your own. Vice. Choose any Castle, Nay City, in our Government, and be Lord of't. Doct. Of neither Sir, I am not so ambitious; Nor would I have your Highnesses secure. We have but faintly yet begun our journey, A thousand difficulties and dangers must be Encountred, ere we end it. Though his hurts, I mean his outward ones, do promise fair, There is a deeper one, and in his minde Must be with care provided for. Melancholy, And at the height, too near of kin to madness, Possesses him; his senses are distracted, Not one, but all; and if I can collect 'em With all the various ways, invention, Or industry ever practis'd, I shall write it My master-piece. Mes. You more and more engage me. Vice. May we not visit him? Doct. By no means Sir, As he is now, such courtesies come untimely, I'll yeeld you reason for't. Should he look on you, It will renew the memory of that Which I would have forgotten. Your good prayers (And those I do presume, shall not be wanting To my endeavors) are the utmost aids I yet desire your Excellencies should grant me. So with my humblest service. Mes. Go and prosper. Exit Doctor. Vice. Observe his piety I have heard, how true I know not, most Physitians as they grow Greater in skill, grow less in their Religion. Attributing so much to natural causes, That they have little faith in that they cannot Deliver Reason for: This Doctor steers Another course; but let this pass, if you please. Your company to my Daughter. Mes. I wait on you. Exeunt. Enter Leonora, and two Women. Leon. Took she no rest to night? 1. Wom. Not any Madam, I am sure she slept not. If she slumbred strait, As if some dreadful vision had appear'd, She started up, her hair unbound, and with Distracted looks, staring about the Chamber, She asks aloud; where is Martino? where Have you conceal'd him? sometimes names Anthonio, Trembling in every joynt, her brows contracted: Her fair face as 'twere chang'd into a curse, Her hands held up thus, and as if her words Were too big to finde passage through her mouth. She groans, then throws her self upon her Bed, Beating her Brest. Leon. 'Tis wondrous strange. 2. Wom. Nay more, She that of late vouchsafed not to be seen, But so adorn'd, as if she were to rival Nero's Poppea, or the Egyptian Queen, Now careless of her beauties; when we offer Our service, she contemns it. Leon. Does she not Sometimes forsake her Chamber? 2. Wom. Much about This hour, then with a strange unsetled gate She measures twice, or thrice the Gallery, Silent, and frowning (we dare not speak to her) And then returns. She's come, pray you now observe her. Enter Almira in black, carelesly habited. Al. Why are my eyes fix'd on the ground, and not Bent upwards? Ha! that which was mortal of My dear Martino, as a debt to nature. I know this mother Earth hath sepulchred: But his diviner part, his Soul, o'r which The tyrant death, nor yet the fatal sword Of curs'd Anthonio, his Instrument, Had the least power, borne upon Angels wings, Appointed to that office, mounted far Above the Firmament. Leon. Strange imagination! Dear Cousin your Martino lives. Al. I know you, And that in this you flatter me. He's dead, As much as could die of him: But look yonder Amongst a million of glorious lights That deck the heavenly Canopy; I have Discern'd his soul transform'd into a star. Do you not see it? Leon. Lady. Al. Look with my eyes. What splendor circles it! the heavenly Archer Not far off distant, appears dim with envy, Viewing himself out-shin'd. Bright Constellation Dart down thy beams of pity on Almira; And since thou findst such grace where now thou art, As I did truly love thee on the Earth, Like a kinde Harbinger, prepare my lodging, And place me near thee. Leon. I much more then fear, She'll grow into a phrensie. Al. How! what's this? A dismal sound! Come nerer Cousin, lay Your ear close to the ground, closer I pray you. Do you howl? are you there Anthonio? Leon. Where sweet Lady? Al. I'th' Vault, in Hell, on the infernal rack, Where murtherers are tormented: Yirk him soundly. 'Twas Rhadamanths sentence; Do your office Furies. How he rores! what plead to me to mediate for you? I am deaf, I cannot hear you. Leon. 'Tis but fancy, Collect your self. Al. Leave babling; 'tis rare Musick. Rhamnusia plays on a pair of tongs Red hot; and Proserpine dances to the consort; Pluto sits laughing by too. So, enough, I do begin to pitie him. Leon. I wish, Madam, You would shew it to your self. 2. Wom. Her fit begins To leave her. Al. O my brains! are you there Cousin? Leon. Now she speaks temperately. I am ever ready To do you service: How do you? Al. Very much troubled. I have had the strangest waking dream of Hell And Heaven, I know not what. Leon. My Lord your Father Is come to visit you. As ye would not grieve him That is so tender of you, entertain him With a becoming dutie. Enter Viceroy, Messina, Pedro, Attendants: Vice. Still forlorn? No comfort my Almira? Mes. In your sorrow, For my Martino, Madam, you have express'd All possible love and tenderness. Too much of it Will wrong your self, and him. He may live Lady (For we are not past hope) with his future service, In some part to deserve it. Al. If Heaven please To be so gratious to me, I'll serve him With such obedience, love, and humbleness, That I will rise up an example for Good wives to follow: But until I have Assurance what fate will determine of me, Thus like a desolate Widow, give me leave To weep for him; for should he die, I have vow'd Not to out-live him; and my humble suit is, One Monument may cover us, and Anthonio In justice you must grant me that be offer'd A Sacrifice to our Ashes. Vice. Prethee put off These sad thoughts, both shall live (I doubt it not) A happy pair. Enter Viceroy, Cuculo, and Borachia. Cuc. O Sir, the foulest treason That ever was discovered. Vice. Speak it, that We may prevent it. Cuc. Nay 'tis past prevention, Though you allow me wise (in modesty, I will not say oraculous) I cannot help it. I am a Statesman, and some say a wise one, But I could never conjure, nor divine Of things to come. Vice. Leave fooling; to the point, What treason? Cuc. The false Prince Don John Anthonio Is fled. Vice. It is not possible. Ped. Peace, Scriech-owl. Cuc. I must speak, and it shall out, sir; the Captain You trusted with the Fort, is run away too. Alm. O miserable woman, I defie All comfort, cheated too of my revenge! As you are my Father sir, and you my Brother, I will not curse you; but I dare, and will say You are unjust and treacherous. If there be A way to death, I'll find it. Exeunt Almira, Leonora, women. Vice. Follow her, She'll do some violent act upon herself: Till she be better temper'd, bind her hands, And fetch the Doctor to her. Had not you A hand in this? Ped. I sir, I never knew Such disobedience. Vice: My honor's touch'd in't: Let Gallies be mann'd forth in his pursuit, Search every Port and Harbor; if I live, He shall not 'scape thus. Mess. Fine hypocrisie! Away dissemblers, 'tis confederacie Betwixt thy son and self, and the false Captain, He could not thus have vanish'd else. Ye have murther'd My Son amongst you, and now murther Justice. You know it most impossible he should live, Howe'r the Doctor for your ends dissembled, And you have shifted hence Anthonio. Vice. Messina, thou art a craz'd and griev'd old man, And being in my Court protected by The law of hospitality, or I should Give you a sharper answer: May I perish, If I knew of his flight. Mess. Fire then the Castle, Hang up the Captains wife and children. Vice. Fie sir. Ped. My Lord, you are uncharitable; capital treasons Exact not so much. Mess. Thanks most noble Signior, We ever had your good word and your love. Cuc. Sir, I dare pass my word, my Lords are clear Of any imputation in this case You seem to load 'em with. Mess. Impertinent fool; No, no, the loving faces you put on Have been but grinning vizors: you have juggled me Out of my son, and out of justice too. But Spain shall do me right; believe me Viceroy, There I will force it from thee by the King, He shall nor eat nor sleep in peace for me Till I am righted for this treacherie. Vice. Thy worse Messina, since no reason can Qualifie thy intemperance, the corruption Of my subordinate Ministers cannot wrong My true integrity, let privy searches Examine all the Land. Ped. Fair fall Anthonio. Ex. Viceroy, Ped. Attend. Cuc. This is my wife, my Lord; troth speak your conscience, Is't not a goodly Dame? Mess. She is no less Sir, I will make use of these; may I intreat you To call my Neece. Bor. With speed sir. Ex. Borachia. Cuc. You may my Lord Suspect me as an Agent in these State conveyances. Let Signior Cuculo then be never more, For all his place, wit, and authority, Held a most worthy honest Gentleman. Enter Borachia with Leonora. Mes. I do acquit you Signior. Neece you see To what extreams I am driven; the cunning Viceroy And his son Pedro, having express'd too plainly Their cold affections to my son Martino; And therefore I conjure thee Leonora, By all thy hopes from me, which is my Dukedom, If my son fail, however all thy fortunes, Though heretofore some love hath past betwixt Don Pedro, and thy self, Abjure him now. And as thou keep'st Almira company, In this her desolation, so in hate To this yong Pedro for thy Cousins love, Be her associate; or assure thy self, I cast thee like a stranger from my blood. If I do ever hear, thou seest, or send'st Token, or receive message by you Heaven, I never more will own thee. Leon. O dear Uncle, You have put a tyrannous yoke upon my heart, And it will break it. Exit Leonora. Mes. Gravest Lady; you May be a great assister in my ends. I buy your diligence thus: Divide this couple, Hinder their enterviews; fain 'tis her will To give him no admittance, if he crave it, And thy rewards shalll be thine own desires. Whereto good Sir, but adde your friendly aids, And use me to my uttermost. Cuculo. My Lord, If my wife please, I dare not contradict. Borachia, what do you say? Bor. I say, my Lord, I know my place, and be assur'd I will Keep fire and toe asunder. Mes. You in this Shall much deserve me. Exit Messina. Cuc. We have took upon us A heavy charge. I hope you'll now forbear Th'excess of Wine. Bor. I will do what I please. This day the markets kept for slaves, go you And buy me a fine timber'd one to assist me. I must be better waited on. Cuc. Any thing. Ped. So you'll leave Wine. Bor. Still prating? Cuc. I am gone Duck. Exit Cuculo. Bor. Pedro! so hot upon the scent, I'll fit him. Enter Pedro. Ped. Donna Borachia, you most happily Are met to pleasure me. Bor. It may be so, I use to pleasure many. Here lies my way, I do beseech you Sir, keep on your voyage. Ped. Be not so short, sweet Lady, I must with you. Bor. With me Sir, I beseech you Sir; why, what Sir See you in me? Ped. Do not mistake me Lady, Nothing but honesty. Bor. Hang honesty; Trump me not up with honesty. Do you mark Sir, I have a charge Sir, and a special charge Sir; And 'tis not honesty can win on me Sir. Ped. Prethee conceive me rightly. Bor. I conceive ye? Ped. But understand. Bor. I will not understand sir, I cannot, nor I do not understand sir. Ped. Prethee Borachia, let me see my Mistress; But look upon her, stand you by. Bor. How's this? Shall I stand by? what do you think of me. Now by the vertue of the place I hold, You are a Paltry Lord to tempt my trust thus. I am no Hellen, nor no Heccuba, To be deflowred of my loyaltie With your fair language. Ped. Thou mistak'st me still. Bor. It may be so; my place will bear me out in't; And will mistake you still, make you your best on't. Ped. A Pox upon thee, let me but behold her. Bor. A Plague upon you, you shall never see her: Ped. This is a croan in grain! Thou art so testie, Prethee take breath, and know thy friends. Bor. I will not, I have no friends, nor I will have none this way. And now I think on't better, why will you see her? Ped. Because she loves me dearly, I her equally. Bor. She hates you damnably, most wickedly, (Build that upon my word) most wickedly; And swears her eies are sick when they behold ye. How fearfully have I heard her rail upon ye, And cast, and rail again, and cast again; Call for hot Waters, and then rail again. Ped. How? 'tis not possible. Bor. I have heard her swear (How justly, you best know, and where the cause lies) That ye are (I shame to tell it) but it must out. Fie, fie, why, how have you deserv'd it? Ped. I am what? Bor. The beastliest man; why what a grief must this be, Sir-reverence of the company, a rank whoremaster: Ten livery whores, she assur'd me on her credit, With weeping eies she spake it, and seven Citizens, Beside all voluntaries that serve under ye, And of all Countries. Ped. This must needs be a lie. Bor. Besides ye are so careless of your body, Which is a foul fault in ye. Ped. Leave your fooling, For this shall be a fable. Happily My Sisters anger may grow strong against me, Which thou mistak'st. Bor. She hates you very well too, But your Mistress hates you heartily; look upon ye? Upon my conscience, she would see the divel first, With eies as big as sawcers. When I but nam'd ye, She has leapt back thirty foot: If once she smell ye, For certainly ye are rank, she says extream rank; And the wind stand with ye too, she is gone for ever. Pedro. For all this I would see her. Bor. That's all one. Have you new eyes when those are scratch'd out? or a nose To clap on warm? Have you proof against a Pisspot; Which if they bid me, I must fling upon you? Ped. I shall not see her, then you say? Bor. It seems so. Ped. Prethree be thus far friend, then good Borachia, To give her but this Letter, and this Ring, And leave thy pleasant lying, which I pardon; But leave it in her pocket, there's no harm in't. I'll take thee up a Petticoat, will that please thee? Bor. Take up my Petticoat? I scorn the motion, I scorn it with my heels; take up my Petticoat? Ped. And why thus hot? Bor. Sir, you shall finde me hotter If you take up my Petticoat. Ped. I'll give thee a new Petticoat: Bor. I scorn the gift: Take up my Petticoat? Alas my Lord, you are to yong, my Lord; To yong my Lord to circumcise me that way. Take up my Petticoat? I am a woman, A woman of another way, my Lord; A Gentlewoman. He that takes up my Petticoat, Shall have enough to do, I warrant him. I would fain see the proudest of you all so lusty. Ped. Thou art dispos'd still to mistake me. Bor. Petticoat. You show now what you are, but do your worst, Sir. Ped. A wild-fire take thee. Bor. I ask no favor of ye, And so I leave ye; and withal I charge ye In my own name, for sir I would have ye know it, In this place I present your fathers person: Upon your life, not dare to follow me: For if you do. Exit Borachia. Ped. Go, and the Pox go with thee, If thou hast so much moisture to receive 'em, For thou wilt have 'em, though a Horse bestow 'em, I must devise a way, for I must see her, And very suddenly; and Madam Petticoat, If all the wit I have, and this can do, I'll make you break your charge, and your hope too. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. Scæn. 1. Enter Master, Man, Don John, Captain, with divers Slaves. Mast. Come rank your selves, and stand out handsomly. Now ring the Bell, that they may know my Market. Stand you two here, you are personable men, And apt to yeeld good sums, if women cheapen.

Your tricks too Sirrah; they are ways to catch the buyer, And if you do 'em well, they'll prove good Dowries. How now? Enter Man. Man. They come Sir, with their bags full loaden. Mast. Reach me my stool. O! here they come: Enter Doctor, Apothecary, Cuculo, and Citizens. Cuc. That's he. He never fails monethly to sell his slaves here, He buys 'em presently upon their taking, And so disperses 'em to every Market. Mast. Begin the song, and chaunt it merrily— Well done. Doct. Good morrow. Mast. Morrow to you Signiors: Doct. We come to look upon your slaves, and buy too, If we can like the persons, and the prices. Cuc. They show fine active fellows. Mast. They are no less Sir, And people of strong labors. Doct. That's i'th' proof Sir. Apo. Pray what's the price of this Red-bearded fellow? If his Gall be good, I have certain uses for him. Mast. My Sorrel slaves are of a lower price, Because the colours faint. Fifty Chekeens Sir. Apo. What be his vertues? Mast. He will poyson Rats, Make him but angry, and his eyes kill Spiders; Let him but fasting, spit upon a Tode, And presently it bursts, and dies; his dreams kill; He'll run you in a wheel, and draw up water; But if his Nose drop in't, 'twill kill an army. When ye have worn him to the Bones with uses, Thrust him into an Oven, luted well, Dry him, and beat him, flesh and bone to powder; And that kills Scabs and Aches of all clymates. Apo. Pray at what distance may I talk to him? Mast. Give him but Sage and Butter in a morning, And there's no fear: But keep him from all women, For there his poyson swells most. Apo. I will have him. Cannot he breed a plague too? Mast. Yes, yes, yes. Feed him with Fogs probatum. Now to you Sir, Do you like this slave? Cuc. Yes, if I like his price well. Mast. The price is full an hundred, nothing bated. Sirrah, sell the Moors there; feel, he's high and lusty, And of a gamesom nature; bold, and secret, Apt to win favor of the man that owns him, By diligence, and duty: Look upon him. Doct. Do ye hear Sir? Mast. I'll be with you presently. Mark but his limbs, that slave will cost ye fourscore. An easie price, turn him about, and view him. For these two Sir? why they are the finest children, Twins on my credit sir. Do you see this Boy, sir, He will run as far from ye in an hour. Cit. Will he so sir? Mast. Conceive me rightly, if upon an errand, As any horse you have. Cit. What will this Girl do? Mast. Sure no harm at all sir, For she sleeps most an end. Cit. An excellent house-wife. Of what Religion are they? Mast. What you will sir, So there be meat, and drink in't; they'll do little That shall offend ye; for their chief desire Is to do nothing at all sir. Cuc. A hundred is too much. Mast. Not a doit bated, He's a brave slave; his eye shows activeness, Fire, and the mettle of a man, dwells in him. Here's one you shall have. Cuc. For what? Mast. For nothing, And thank ye too. Doct. What can he do? Mast. Why, any thing that's ill, And never blush at it: He's so true a theef, That he will steal from himself, and think he has got by it. He stole out of his Mothers belly, being an Infant, And from a lousie Nurse he stole his nature; From a Dog his look, and from an Ape his nimbleness; He will look in your face, and pick your pockets, Rob ye the most wise Rat of a Cheese-paring; There where a Cat will go in, he will follow, His body has no backbone. In to my company He stole, for I never bought him, and will steal in to yours, And ye stay a little longer. Now if any of ye Be given to the excellent art of lying, Behold, before ye here the master-piece; He will out-lie him that taught him, Monsieur Devil, Offer to swear he has eaten nothing in a twelve moneth, When his mouth's full of Meat. Cuc. Pray keep him, he's a Jewel, And here's your money for this fellow. Mast. He's yours sir? Cuc. Come follow me. Exit with Don John. Cit. Twenty Chekeens for these two. Mast. For five and twenty take 'em. Cit. There's your money; I'll have 'em, if it be to sing in Cages. Mast. Give 'em hard Eggs, you never had such Black birds. Cit. Is she a Maid, do'st think? Mast. I dare not swear Sir, She is nine year old, at ten you shall finde few here: Cit. A merry fellow, thou say'st true. Come children. Exit with the Moors. Doct. Here tell your money; if his life but answer His outward promises, I have bought him cheap Sir. Mast. Too cheap a conscience, he's a pregnant Knave. Full of fine thoughts, I warrant him. Doct. He's but weak timber'd. Mast. 'Tis the better, He will turn Gentleman a great deal sooner. Doct. Very weak Legs. Mast. Strong as the time allows Sir. Doct. What's that fellow? Mast. Who this? The finest thing in all the world Sir, The punctuallest, and the perfitest an English mettle, But coyn'd in France; your servants servant Sir, Do you understand that? or your shadows servant. Will you buy him to carry in a Box! Kiss your hand sirrah; Let fall your cloak on one shoulder; face to your left hand; Fether your Hat; slope your Hat; now charge your honor. What think you of this fellow? Doct. Indeed I know not, I never saw such an Ape before. But hark you, Are these things serious in his nature? Mast. Yes, yes; Part of his Creed: come do some more devices. Quarrel a little, and take him for your enemy, Do it in dumb show. Now observe him nearly. Doct. This fellow's mad, stark mad. Mast. Believe they are all so. I have sold a hundred of 'em. Doct. A strange Nation: What may the women be? Mast. As mad as they; And as I have heard for truth, a great deal madder, Yet you may finde some civil things amongst 'em; But they are not respected. Nay never wonder, They have a City Sir, I have been in't, And therefore dare affirm it; where, if you saw With what a load of vanity 'tis fraughted, How like an everlasting Morris-dance it looks; Nothing but Hobby-horse, and Maid-marrian; You would start indeed: Doct. They are handsom men. Mast. Yes: If they would thank their Maker, And seek no further; but they have new Creators God Tailor, and God Mercer, a kinde of Jews Sir, But faln into Idolatry, for they worship Nothing with so much service, as the Cow-calfs. Doct. What do mean you by Cow-calfs? Mast. Why their women. Will you see him do any more tricks? Doct. 'Tis enough, I thank ye; But yet I'fl buy him, for the rareness of him. He may make my princely patient mirth, and that done, I'll claim him in my study, that at void hours I may run o'r the story of his Country. Mast. His price is forty. Doct. Hold, I'll once be foolish, And buy a lump of levity to laugh at. Apo. Will your worship walk? Doct. How now Apothecary, Have you been buying too? Apo. A little Sir; A dose or two of mischief. Doct. Fare ye well Sir, As these prove, we shall look the next wind for ye. Mast. I shall be with ye Sir. Doct. Who bought this fellow? 2. Cit. Not I. Apo. Nor I. Doct. Why do's he follow us then? Mast. Did not I tell ye he would steal to ye? 2. Cit. Sirrah. You mouldy chops, know your crib, I would wish you, And get from whence you came. Slave. I came from no place. Doct. Wilt thou be my fool, for fools they say, will tell truth. Sla. Yes, if you will give me leave Sir to abuse you, For I can do that naturally. Doct. And I can beat ye. Slave. I should be sorry else, Sir. Mast. He looks for that, as duly as his victuals, And will be extream sick when he is not beaten. He will be as wanton, when he has a bone broken, As a Cat in a bowl on the water. Doct. You will part with him? Mast. To such a friend as you Sir. Doct. And without money? Mast. Not a peny Signior; And would he were better for ye. Doct. Follow me then, The Knave may teach me something. Slave. Something, that You dearly may repent, howe'r you scorn me, The slave may prove your Master. Doct. Farewel once more. Mast. Farewel, and when the wind serves next, expect me. Exeunt. Enter Cuculo, and Don John. Cuc. Come Sir, you are mine, Sir, now; you serve a man Sir, That when you know more, you will finde. John. I hope so Cuc. What do'st thou hope? John. To finde ye a kinde master. Cuc. Finde you your self a diligent true servant, And take the precept of the wise before ye, And then you may hope Sirrah. Understand: You serve me. What is me? a man of credit. John. Yes Sir. Cuc. Of special credit, special office. Hear first, and understand again, of special office. A man that nods upon the thing he meets, And that thing bows. John. 'Tis fit it should be so Sir. Cuc. It shall do so. A man neer all importance. Do'st thou digest this truly? John. I hope I shall Sir. Cuc. Besides, thou art to serve a noble Mistress, Of equal place and trust. Serve usefully, Serve all with diligence, but her delights, There make your stop. She is a woman sirrah; And though a cull'd out vertue, yet a woman Thou art not troubled with the strength of blood, And stirring faculties, for she will show a fair one? John. As I am a man, I may; but as I am your man, Your trusty, useful man, those thoughts shall perish. Cuc: 'Tis apt, and well distinguish'd. The next precept, And then observe me, you have all your duty: Keep as thou wouldst keep thine eye-sight, all Wine from her, All talk of Wine. John. Wine is a comfort, Sir. Cuc. A Devil, Sir; let her not dream of Wine, Make her believe there neither is, nor was Wine, Swear it. John. Will you have me lye? Cuc. To my end, Sir; For if one drop of Wine but creep into her, She is the wisest woman in the world straight, And all the women in the world together Are but a whisper to her; a thousand Iron-mills Can be heard no further then a pair of Nut-crackers: Keep her from Wine, Wine makes her dangerous. Fall back; my Lord Don Pedro! Enter Pedro. Ped. Now Mr. Office: What is the reason that your vigilant greatness, And your wives wonderful wiseness have lock'd up from me The way to see my Mistress? whose Dog's dead now, That you observe these Vigils? Cuc. Very well, my Lord; Belike we observe no law then, nor no order, Nor feel no power, nor will of him that made 'em, When State-commands thus slightly are disputed: Ped. What State-command? dost thou think any State Would give thee any thing but Eggs to keep, Or trust thee with a secret above lousing? Cuc. No, no, my Lord I am not passionate, You cannot work me that way to betray me. A point there is in't, that you must not see sir, A secret and a serious point of State too; And do not urge it further, do not Lord, It will not take; you deal with them that wink not: You try'd my wife, alas you thought she was foolish, Won with an empty word; you have not found it. Ped. I have found a pair of Coxcombs, that I am sure on. Cuc. Your Lordship may say three; I am not passionate. Ped. How's that? Cuc. Your Lordship found a faithful Gentlewoman, Strong, and inscrutable as the Viceroy's heart, A woman of another making, Lord: And lest she might partake with womans weakness, I have purchas'd her a rib to make her perfect, A rib that will not shrink, nor break i'th' bending: This trouble we are put to, to prevent things, Which your good Lordship holds but necessary. Ped. A fellow of a handsom and free promise, And much methinks I am taken with his countenance. Do you serve this Yeoman, Porter? Cuc. Not a word Basta, your Lordship may discourse your freedom; He is a slave of State sir, so of silence. Ped. You are very punctual State-cut; fare ye well, I shall find time to fit you too, I fear not. Exit Pedro. Cuc. And I shall fit you Lord; you would be billing; You are too hot, sweet Lord, too hot: Go you home, And there observe these lessons I first taught you, Look to your charge abundantly; be wary, Trusty and wary: much weight hangs upon me, Watchful and wary too! this Lord is dangerous, Take courage and resist; for other uses Your Mistress will inform ye. Go, be faithful, And do ye hear? no wine. John. I shall observe Sir. Exeunt. Enter Doctor and Surgeons: Doct. He must take air. 1 Sur. Sir, under your correction, The violence of motion may make His wounds bleed fresh. 2 Sur. And he hath lost already Too much blood, in my judgment. Doct. I allow that; But to choak up his spirits in a dark room, Is far more dangerous. He comes; no questions. Enter Martino. Mar. Certain we have no reason, nor that soul Created of that pureness books perswade us: We understand not sure; nor feel that sweetness That men call Vertues chain to link our actions. Our imperfections form, and flatter us; A will to rash and rude things; is our reason, And that we glory in, that makes us guilty. Why did I wrong this man, unmanly wrong him, Unmannerly? He gave me no occasion; In all my heat how noble was his temper? And when I had forgot both man and manhood, With what a gentle bravery did he chide me? And say he had kill'd me, whither had I travell'd? Kill'd me in all my rage, oh how it shakes me! Why didst thou do this, fool? a woman taught me, The Devil and his Angel woman bid me. I am a beast, the wildest of all beasts, And like a beast I make my blood my master: Farewell, farewell for ever name of Mistress, Out of my heart I cross thee; love and women Out of my thoughts. Doct. I, now you shew your manhood. Mar. Doctor believe me, I have bought my knowledge, And dearly, Doctor; they are dangerous creatures, They sting at both ends, Doctor; worthless creatures, And all their loves and favors end in ruines. Doct. To man indeed. Mar. Why now thou tak'st me rightly: What can they shew, or be? what act deserve us While we have vertue, and pursue her beauties? Doct. And yet I have heard Of many vertuous women. Mar. Not many, Doctor, there your reading fails you: Would there were more, and in their loves less dangers. Doct. Love is a noble thing without all doubt sir. Mar. Yes, and an excellent to cure the itch. Ex. 1 Sur. Strange melancholy! Doct. By degrees 'twill lessen, Provide your things. 2 Sur. Our care shall not be wanting. Exeunt. Enter Leonora and Almira. Leon. Good Madam, for your healths sake cleer those clouds up, That feed upon your beauties like diseases: Times hand will turn again, and what he ruines Gently restore, and wipe off all your sorrows Believe ye are to blame, much to blame Lady; You tempt his loving care whose eye has numbred All our afflictions, and the time to cure 'em: You rather with this torrent choak his mercies Then gently slide in to his providence. Sorrows are well allow'd, and sweeten Nature, Where they express no more then drops on lillies; But when they fall in storms, they bruise our hopes, Make us unable (though our comforts meet us) To hold our heads up: Come, you shall take comfort; This is a sullen grief becomes condemn'd men, That feel a weight of sorrow through their souls: Do but look up: Why so? is not this better Then hanging down your head still like a Violet, And dropping out those sweet eyes for a wager? Pray ye speak a little. Al. Pray ye desire no more, And if ye love me, say no more. Leon. How fain (If I would be as wilful, and partake in't) Would you destroy your self? how often, Lady, Ev'n of the same disease have you cur'd me, And shook me out on't; chid me, tumbled me, And forc'd my hands thus? Al. By these tears no more. Leo. You are too prodigal of 'em. Well, I will not, For though my love bids me transgress your will, I have a service to your sorrows still. Exeunt. Enter Pedro and Don John. John. Indeed my Lord, my place is not so neer; I wait below stairs, and there sit, and wait Who comes to seek accesses; nor is it fit Sir My rudeness should intrude so neer their lodgings. Ped. Thou maist invent a way, 'tis but a tryal; But carrying up this Letter, and this token, And giving 'em discreetly to my Mistress, The Lady Leonora; there's my Purse, Or any thing thou wilt ask me: if thou knew'st me, And what I may be to thee for this courtesie. John. Your Lordship speaks so honestly, and freely, That by my troth I'll venture. Ped. I deerly thank thee. John. And it shall cost me hard; nay, keep your purse Sir: For though my bodies bought, my minde was never. Though I am bound, my courtesies are no slaves. Ped. Thou shouldst be truly gentle. John. If I were so, The state I am in, bids you not believe it. But to the purpose Sir, Give me your Letter, And next your counsel, for I serve a crafty Mistress. Ped. And she must be remov'd, thou wilt else ne'er do it. John. I, there's the plague. Think, and I'll think a while too. Ped. Her husbands suddenly faln sick. John. She cares not If he were dead, indeed it would do better. Ped. Would he were hang'd. John. Then she would run for joy, Sir. Ped. Some Lady crying out. John. She has two already. Ped. Her house is a fire. John. Let the fool, my husband, quench it. This will be her answer: This may take, it will sure I Your Lordship must go presently, and send me Two or three bottles of your best Greek Wine; The strongest, and sweetest. Ped. Instantly; But will that do? Exit Pedro. John. Let me alone to work it; Wine I was charg'd to keep by all means from her, All secret locks it opens, and all counsels, That I am sure, and gives men all accesses. Pray Heaven she be not loving, when she's drunk now; For drunk she shall be, though my pate pay for it; She'll turn my stomach then abominably, She has a most wicked face, and that leud face, Being a drunken face; what face will there be? She cannot ravish me. Now if my Master Should take her so, and know I minister'd, What will his wisdom do? I hope be drunk too, And then all's right. Well Lord, to do the service, Above these Puppit-plays, I keep a life yet. Here come the executioners: You are welcome, Give me your load, and tell my Lord, I am at it. Enter Servant with Bottles. Serv. I will sir, speed you sir. Exit John. Good speed on all sides. 'Tis mon-strong, strong Wine: O the yauns that she'll make! Look to your stern deer Mistress, and steer right, Here's that will work, as high as the Bay of Portugal: Stay, let me see; I'll try her by the Nose first, For if she be a right Sowe, sure she'll finde it. Enter Borachia. She is yonder by her self, the Lady's from her. Now to begin my sacrifice: she stirs, and vents it. O how she holds her nose up like a Jennet I'th' wind of a Grass-mare! She has it full now, And now she comes. I'll stand aside a while. Bor. 'Tis wine; I sure 'tis wine! excellent strong wine! I'th must I take it: Very wine: this way too. John. How true, she hunts? I'll make the train a little longer. Bor. Stronger, and stronger still! still blessed wine! John. Now she hunts hot. Bor. All that I can make for this wine, This way it went sure. John. Now she is at a cold scent. Make out your doubles Mistress. O well hunted, That's she, that's she. Bor. O, if I could but see it! O what a pretious scent it has! but handle it! John. Now I'll untappice. Bor. What's that? still 'tis stronger. Why how now sirrah? what's that? answer quickly, And to the point. John. 'Tis wine forsooth, good wine, Excellent Candi-wine. Bor. 'Tis well forsooth: Is this a drink for slaves? Why sawcy sirrah, Excellent Candi-wine; draw nearer to me, Reach in me bottle, Why thou most debauch'd slave. John. Pray be not angry Mistress, for with all my service And pains, I purchas'd this for you, I dare not drink it; For you a present, onely for your pleasure, To shew in little, what a thanks I owe The hourly courtesies, your goodness gives me. Bor. And I will give thee more; there kiss my hand on't. John. I thank you deerly for your durty favor, How ranck it smells! Bor. By thy leave sweet Bottle, And Sugar-candi-wine, I now come to thee; Hold your hand under. John. How does your Worship like it? Bor. Under again, again; and now come kiss me, I'll be a mother to thee, Come, drink to me. John. I do beseech your pardon. Bor. Here's to thee then, I am easily intreated for thy good, 'Tis naught for thee indeed, 'twill make thee break out; Thou hast a pure complexion: now for me 'Tis excellent, 'tis excellent for me. Son slave I have a cold stomach, and the wind. John. Blows out a cry at your both ends. Bor. Kiss again, Cherish thy Lips, for thou shalt kiss fair Ladies: Son slave I have them for thee; I'll shew thee all. John. Heav'n bless mine eyes! Bor. Ev'n all the secrets, Son slave, In my dominion. John. Oh here come the Ladies, Now to my business. Enter Almira and Leonora. Leon. This air will much refresh you: Al: I must sit down. Leon. Do, and take freer thoughts; The place invites you, and I walk by, like your Sentinel. Bor. And thou shalt be my Heir, I'll leave thee all, Heav'n knows to what 'twill mount to; but abundance: I'll leave thee two yong Ladies, what think you of that Boy? Where is the Bottle? Two delicate yong Ladies: But first you shall commit with me. Do you mark son, And shew your self a Gentleman, that's the truth son: John. Excellent Lady, kissing your fair hand, And humbly craving pardon for intruding This Letter, and this Ring. Leon. From whom, I pray you sir? John. From the most noble, loving Lord, Don Pedro, The servant of your Vertues. Bor. And prethee, good son slave, be wise and circumspect, And take heed of being overtaken with too much drink; For it is a lamentable sin, and spoils all: Why 'tis the damnablest thing to be drunk son, Heav'n cannot endure it. And hark you, one thing I would have done: Knock my husband on the head, as soon as may be, For he is an arrant Puppy, and cannot perform— Why, where the devil is this foolish Bottle? Leon. I much thank you, and this sir for your pains. John. No, gentle Lady, That I can do him service, is my merit, My faith, my full reward. Leon. Once more I thank you. Since I have met so true a friend to goodness, I dare deliver to your charge, my answer: Pray you tell him Sir, this night I do invite him To meet me in the Garden. Means he may finde, For love, they say, wants no abilities. John. Nor shall he, Madam, if my help may prosper. So everlasting Love, and Sweetness, bless ye. She's at it still, I dare not now appear to her. Al. What fellows that? Leon. Indeed I know not, Madam, It seems of some strange Countrey by his habit; Nor can I shew you by what mystery He wrought himself into this place, prohibited. Al. A handsom man. Leon. But of a minde more handsom. Al. Was his business to you? Leon. Yes, from a friend you woot of. Al. A very handsom fellow, And well demean'd. Leon. Exceeding well, and speaks well. Al. And speaks well too? Leon. I passing well, and freely, And as he promises of a most clear nature, Brought up sure far above his show. Al. It seems so: I would I had heard him, friend. Comes he again? Leon. Indeed I know not if he do. Al. 'Tis no matter. Come let's walk in. Leon. I am glad you have found your tongue yet. Borachia sings. Enter Cuculo. Cuc. My wife is very merry; sure 'twas her voice, Pray Heav'n there be no drink in't, then I allow it. John. 'Tis sure my Master, now the game begins; Here will be spitting of fire a both sides presently, Send me but safe deliver'd. Cuc. O my heart aks! My head aks too: Mercy, O me she's perish'd! She has gotten wine! she is gone for ever. Bor. Come hither Ladies, carry your bodies swimming; Do your three duties then, then fall behinde me. Cuc. O thou pernitious Raschal! What hast thou done? John. I done alas Sir, I have done nothing. Cuc. Sirrah, How came she by this wine? John. Alas, I know not. Bor. Who's that, that talks of wine there? John. Forsooth, my Master. Bor. Bring him before me, son slave. Cuc. I will know it. This Bottle? how this Bottle? Bor. Do not stir it; For if you do, by this good wine, I'll knock ye, I'll beat ye damnable, yea, and nay, I'll beat you; And when I have broke it 'bout your head, do you mark me? Then will I tie it to your Worship's tail, And all the dogs i'th' Town shall follow you. No question I would avise you how I came by it. I will have none of these points handled now. Cuc. She'll never be well again, while the world stands. John. I hope so. Cuc. How doest thou Lamb? Bor. Well, God-a-mercy Bell-wether, how doest thou? Stand out: Son slave, sit you here, and before this Worshipful Audience Propound a doubtful question: See who's drunk now: Cuc. Now, now, it works, the devil now dwells in her. Bor. Whether the Heav'n, or the Earth, be neerer the Moon? Or what's the natural Reason, why a woman longs To make her husband Cuckold? Bring me your Cousin The Curate now, that great Philosopher; He that found out a Pudding had two ends; That learned Clerk, that notable Gymnosophist, And let him with his Jacobs-Staff discover What is the third part of Three farthings, three Half pence, being the half, and I am satisfied. Cuc. You see she hath Learning enough, if she could dispose it. Bor. Too much for thee, thou Logger-head, thou Bull-head. Cuc. Nay good Borachia Bor. Thou a sufficient States-man? A Gentleman of Learning, hang thee Dog-whelp; Thou shadow of a man of action; Thou scab o'th' Court, go sleep you drunken Rascal; Ye debauch'd Puppy, get you home, and sleep sirrah, And so will I son slave, thou shalt sleep with me. Cuc. Prethee look to her tenderly. Bor. No words sirrah Of any wine, or any thing like wine, Or any thing concerning wine, or by wine, Or from, or with wine: Come lead me like a Countess. Cuc. Thus must we bear, poor men! There is a trick in't, But when slie is well again, I'll trick her for it. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. Scæn. 1. Enter Pedro. Ped. Now if this honest fellow do but prosper, I hope I shall make fair return. I wonder I hear not from the Prince of Tarent, yet I hope he's landed well, and to his safety, The winds have stood most gently to his purpose. My honest friend! Enter Don John. John. Your Lordships poorest servant. Ped. How hast thou sped? John. My Lord, as well as wishes, My way hath reach'd your Mistress, and delivered Your Letter-love, and Token, who with all joy, And vertuous constancy, desires to see you, Commands you this night, by her loving power, To meet her in the Garden, Ped. Thou hast made me, Redeem'd me, man, again from all my sorrows; Done above wonder for me. Is it so? John. I should be now too old to learn to lie sir, And as I live, I never was good flatterer. Ped. I do see some thing in this fellows face still, That ties my heart fast to him: Let me love thee, Nay, let me honor thee for this fair service, And if I ere forget it. John. Good my Lord, The onely knowledge of me, is too much bounty. My service, and my life sir. Ped. I shall think on't; But how for me to get access? John. 'Tis easie, I'll be your guide sir, all my care shall lead you; My credits better then you think. Ped. I thank ye, And soon I'll wait your promise. John. With all my duty. Exeunt. Enter Viceroy, Messina, Doctor, and Cuculo. Doct. All's as I tell you Princes, you shall here Be witness to his fancies, melancholly, And strong imagination of the wrongs. His inhumanity to Don Anthonio Hath rent his minde into so many pieces Of various imaginations, that Like the Celestial Bowe, this colour now The object, then another, till all vanish. He says a man might watch to death, or fast, Or think his spirit out; to all which humors, I do apply my self, checking the bad, And cherishing the good. For these, I have Prepar'd my Instruments, fitting his Chamber With trap-doors, and descents; sometimes presenting Good spirits of the air, bad of the earth, To pull down, or advance his fair intentions. He's of a noble nature, yet sometimes Thinks that which by confederacie I do, Is by some skill in Magick. Here he comes. A bed drawn forth, Martino upon it, a book in's hand. Unsent I do beseech you. What do you read Sir? Mar. A strange position which doth much perplex me: That every Soul's alike, a musical Instrument, The Faculties in all men equal Strings, Well, or ill handled; and those sweet, or harsh. Exit Doct. How like a Fidler I have plaid on mine then! Declin'd the high pitch of my birth and breeding, Like the most barbarous Peasant; read my pride Upon Anthonio's meek humility, Wherein he was far valianter then I. Meekness, thou wait'st upon couragious spirits, Enabling sufferance past inflictions: In patience Tarent overcame me more Then in my wounds. Live then no more to men, Shut day-light from thine eyes, here cast thee down, And with a sullen sigh breath forth thy soul. What art? an Apparition, or a Man? Enter Doctor like a Frier. Doct. A man, and sent to counsel thee. Mar. Despair Has stopt mine ears; thou seem'st a holy Friar? Doct. I am, by Doctor Paulo sent to tell thee: Thou art too cruel to thy self in seeking To lend compassion and aid to others. My Order bids me comfort thee: I have heard all Thy various, troubled passions. Hear but my story. In way of youth I did enjoy one friend, As good and perfect as Heaven e're made man: This friend was plighted to a beauteous woman, (Nature proud of her workmanship) mutual love Possest 'em both; her heart in his breast lodg'd, And his in hers: Mar. No more of love, good father; It was my surfeit, and I loath it now, As men in Feavers meat they fell sick on. Doct. Howe're 'tis worth your hearing. This betroth'd Lady (The ties and duties of a friend forgotten) Spurr'd on by lust, I treacherously pursu'd: Contemn'd by her, and by my friend reprov'd, Despis'd by honest men, my conscience sear'd up, Love I converted into frantick rage; And by that false guide led, I summon'd him In this bad cause, his sword 'gainst mine to prove, If he or I might claim most right in love. But fortune (that does seld' or never give Success to right and vertue) made him fall Under my sword. Blood, blood, a friends dear blood, A vertuous friends shed by a Villain, me, In such a monstrous and unequal cause, Lies on my conscience. Mar. And durst thou live After this to be so old? 'tis an illusion Rais'd up by my charms: A man would not have liv'd; Art quiet in thy bosom? Doct. As the sleep Of Infants. Mar. My fault did not equal this; Yet I have emptied my heart of joy, Only to store sighs up. What were the arts That made thee live so long in rest? Doct. Repentance Hearty, that cleans'd me; Reason then confirm'd me I was forgiven, and took me to my Beads. Exit Doctor: Mar. I am i'th' wrong path; tender conscience Makes me forget mine honor: I have done No evil like this, yet I pine, whilst he, A few tears of his true contrition tender'd, Securely sleeps. Ha, where keeps peace of conscience, That I may buy her? No where, not in life. 'Tis feign'd that Jupiter two Vessels plac'd, The one with honey fill'd, the other gall, At th'entry of Olympus: Destinie There brewing these together, suffers not One man to pass before he drinks this mixture. Hence is it we have not an hour of life In which our pleasures relish not some pain, Our sowrs some sweetness. Love doth taste of both. Revenge, that thirsty Dropsie of our souls, Which makes us covet that which hurts us most, Is not alone sweet, but partakes of tartness: Mess. Is't not a strange effect? Vice. Past president. Cuc. His Brain-pan's perish'd with his wounds: Go to, I knew 'twould come to this. Vice. Peace, man of wisdom. Mar. Pleasure's the hook of evil, ease of care, And so the general object of the Court: Yet some delights are lawful. Honor is Vertue's allow'd ascent: Honor that clasps All perfect Justice in her arms; that craves No more respect then what she gives; that does Nothing but what she'll suffer. This distracts me, But I have found the right. Had Don Anthonio Done that to me, I did to him, I should have kill'd him; The injury so foul, and done in publique, My Footman would not bear it. Then in honor Wronging him so, I'll right him on my self: There's honor, justice, and full satisfaction Equally tender'd; 'tis resolv'd, I'll do't. Enter Doctor (like a Soldier) and the English Slave (like a Courtier.) Slave. They take all weapons from me. Mess. Bless my son. Vice. The careful Doctor's come again. Mess. Rare man! How shall I pay this debt? Cuc. He that is with him, Is one of the slaves he lately bought, he said T'accommodate his cure. He's English born, But French in his behaviour; a delicate slave. Vice. The slave is very fine. Cuc. Your English slaves Are ever so; I have seen an English slave Far finer then his master. There's a State-point Worthy your observation. Doct. On thy life Be perfect in thy lesson. Fewer legs, slave. Mar. My thoughts are search'd and answer'd; for I did Desire a Soldier and a Courtier To yield me satisfaction in some doubts Not yet concluded of. Doct. Your Doctor did Admit us Sir. En. Slave. And we are at your service; whate'r it be, command it. Mar. You appear A Courtier in the race of Love; how far In honor are you bound to run? E. Sl. I'll tell you, You must not spare expence, but wear gay cloaths, And you may be too prodigal of oaths To win a Mistress favor; not afraid To pass unto her through her Chamber-maid, You may present her gifts, and of all sorts, Feast, dance, and revel; they are lawful sports: The choice of Suiters you must not deny her, Nor quarrel though you find a Rival by her: Build on your own deserts, and ever be A stranger to Loves enemy, Jealousie, For that draws on— Mar. No more; this points at me, [Ex. Slave] I ne'r observ'd these rules. Now speak old Soldier, The height of honor? Doct. No man to offend, Ne'r to reveal the secrets of a friend; Rather to suffer, then to do a wrong; To make the heart no stranger to the tongue; Provok'd, not to betray an Enemy, Nor eat his meat I choak with flattery; Blushless to tell wherefore I wear my scars, Or for my conscience, or my Countries wars; To aim at just things; if we have wildly run Into offences, wish 'em all undone. 'Tis poor in grief for a wrong done to die, Honor to dare to live, and satisfie. Vice. Mark how he winds him. Mess. Excellent man. Doct. Who fights With passions, and orecomes 'em, is indu'd With the best vertue, passive fortitude Ex. Doctor. Mar. Thou hast touch'd me Soldier; oh this Honor bears The right stamp; would all Soldiers did profess Thy good religion. The discords of my soul Are tun'd, and make a heavenly harmony: [Musick What sweet peace feel I now? I am ravish'd with it. Vice. How still he sits! Cuc. Hark, Musique. Mess. How divinely This Artist gathers scatter'd sense; with cunning Composing the fair Jewel of his mind, Broken in peeces, and nigh lost before. Enter Doctor, like a Philosopher: A good, an ill Genius presented. Their Song. While it's singing, the Doctor goes off, and returns in his own shape. Vice. See Protean Paulo in another shape. Doct. Away I'll bring him shortly perfect, doubt not. Mess. Master of thy great Art! Vice. As such we'll hold thee. Mess. And study honors for him. Cuc. I'll be sick On purpose to take physick of this Doctor. Exeunt. Mar. Doctor, thou hast perfected a Bodies cure T'amaze the world; and almost cur'd a Mind Neer phrensie. With delight I now perceive You for my recreation have invented The several Objects, which my Melancholy Sometimes did think you conjur'd, otherwhiles Imagin'd 'em Chimera's. You have been My Friar, Soldier, my Philosopher, My Poet, Architect, my Physitian; Labor'd for me more then your slaves for you In their assistance: In your moral Song Of my good Genius, and my bad, you have won me A chearful heart, and banish'd discontent; There being nothing wanting to my wishes, But once more, were it possible, to behold Don John Anthonio. Doct. There shall be Letters sent Into all parts of Christendom, to inform him Of your recovery, which now Sir I doubt not. Mar. What honors, what rewards can I heap on you? Doct. That my endeavours have so well succeeded, Is a sufficient recompence. Pray you retire Sir, Not too much air so soon. Mar. I am obedient. Exeunt. Enter Almira and Leonora. Leon. How strangely this Fellow runs in her mind! Al. Do you hear Cousin? Leon. Her sadness clean forsaken: Al. A poor slave Bought for my Governess, say you? Leon. I fear so. Al. And do you think a Turk? Leon. His habit shews it, At least bought for a Turk. Al. I, that may be so. Leon. What if he were one naturally? Al. Nay 'tis nothing, Nothing to the purpose; and yet methinks 'tis strange Such handsomness of mind, and civil outside Should spring from those rude Countries. Leon. If it be no more, I'll call our Governess, and she can shew you. Al. Why do you think it is? Leon. I do not think so. Al. Fie! no, no, by no means; and to tell thee truth Wench, I am truly glad he is here, be what he will; Let him be still the same he makes a shew of, For now we shall see something to delight us. Leon. And Heav'n knows, we have need on't. Al. Heigh ho! my heart aks. Prethee call in our Governess. Pox o'this fellow— Exit Leonora: Why do I think so much of him? how the devil Creep'd he in to my head? and yet beshrew me, Me thinks I have not seen, I lie, I have seen A thousand handsomer, a thousand sweeter. But say this fellow were adorn'd as they are, Set-off to shew, and glory. What's that to me? Fie, what a fool am I? what idle fancies Buz in my brains? Enter Borachia, and Leonora. Bor. And how doth my sweet Lady? Leon. She wants your company to make her merry. Bor. And how does Master Bug, I pray you Madam? Leon. Do you mean her little dog? Bor. I mean his Worship. Leon. Troubled with Fleas a little. Bor. Alas poor Chicken: Leon. She is here, and drunk, very fine drunk, I take it, I found her with a Bottle for her Boulster, Lying along, and making love. Al. Borachia, Why, where hast thou been Wench? she looks not well, friend. Art not not with childe? Bor. I promise ye, I know not, I am sure my Bellies full, and that's a shrewd sign: Besides I am shrewdly troubled with a Tiego Here in my head, Madam; often with this Tiego, It takes me very often Leon. I believe thee. Al. You must drink wine. Bor. A little would do no harm sure. Al. 'Tis a raw humor blows into your head; Which good, strong wine will temper. Bor. I thank your Highness, I will be rul'd, though much against my nature: For wine, I ever hated from my Cradle, Yet for my good. Leon. I for your good, by all means. Al. Borachia, what new fellows that thou hast gotten? (Now she will sure be free) that handsom stranger? Bor. How much wine must I drink, an't please your Ladiship? Al. She's finely greaz'd. Why two or three round draughts Wench. Bor. Fasting. Al. At any time. Bor. I shall hardly do it; But, yet I'll try good Madam. Leon. Do 'twill work well. Al. But prethee answer me, what is this fellow? Bor. I'll tell you two: But let it go no further. Leon. No, no, by no means. Bor. May I not drink before bed too? Leon. At any hour. Bor. And say i'th' night it take me? Al. Drink then: But what this man? Bor. I'll tell ye Madam, But pray ye be secret. He's the great Turks son, for certain, And a fine Christian; my husband bought him for me. He's circumsing'd. Leon. He's circumcis'd, thou wouldst say. Al. How doest thou know? Bor. I had an eye upon him; But ev'n as sweet a Turk, an't like your Ladiship, And speaks ye as pure Pagan. I'll assure ye, My husband had a notable peni-worth of him. And found me but the Turks own son, his own son By father and mother, Madam. Leon. She's mad drunk. Al. Prethee Borachia call him, I would see him, And tell thee how I like him. Bor. As fine a Turk, Madam, For that which appertains to a true Turk: Al. Prethee call him. Bor. He waits here at the stairs; son slave come hither. Enter Don John. Pray ye give me leave a little to instruct him, He's raw yet in the way of entertainment, Son slave, where's the other bottle? John. In the bed-straw, I hid it there. Bor. Go up and make your honors. Madam, the Tiego takes me now, now Madam, I must needs be unmannerly. Al. Pray ye be so Leon. You know your cure. Bor. I'th' bed-straw? John. There you'll finde it. Exit Borachia. Al. Come hither sir: How long have you serv'd here? John. A poor time, Madam, yet, to shew my service. Al. I see thou art diligent. John. I would be, Madam, 'Tis all the portion left me, that and truth. Al. Thou art but yong? John. Had Fortune meant me so, Excellent Lady, Time had not much wronged me. Al. Wilt thou serve me? John. In all my prayers, Madam, Else such a misery as mine but blasts ye. Al. Beshrew my heart he speaks well, wondrous honestly. Aside. John. Madam, your loving Lord stays for ye. Leon. I thank ye. Your pardon for an hour deer friend. Al. Your pleasure. Leon. I deerly thank ye sir. Exit Leonora. John. My humblest service. She views me narrowly, yet sure she knows me not: I dare not trust the time yet, nor I must not. Al. Ye are not as your habit shews? John. No Madam, His hand, that for my sins lies heavy on me, I hope will keep me from being a slave to the devil. Al. A brave cleer minde he has, and nobly season'd. What Country are ye of? John. A Biscan, Lady. Al. No doubt, a Gentleman. John. My father thought so. Alm. I, and I warrant thee a right fair woman Thy mother was; he blushes, that confirms it. Upon my soul, I have not seen such sweetness, I prethee blush again. John. 'Tis a weakness, Madam, I am easily this way woo'd too. Al. I thank ye; Of all that ere I saw, thou art the perfittest. Aside. Now you must tell me sir, for now I long for't. John. What would she have? Al. The story of your fortune; The hard, and cruel fortune brought you hither. John. That makes me stagger; yet I hope I am hid still, Aside. That I came hither, Madam, was the fairest. Al. But how this misery ye bear, fell on ye? John. Infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem. Al. Come, I will have it; I command ye tell it, For such a speaker I would hear for ever. John. Sure, Madam, 'twil but make you sad and heavy, Because I know your goodness full of pity, And 'tis so poor a subject too, and to your ears, That are acquainted with things, sweet and easie, So harsh a harmony. Al. I prethee speak it. John. I ever knew Obedience the best Sacrifice, Honor of Ladies, then first passing over Some few years of my youth, that are impertinent; Let me begin the sadness of my story, Where I began to loose my self, to love first. Al. 'Tis well, go forward. Some rare peece I look for. John. Not far from, where my Father lives, a Lady, A neighbor by, blest with as great a beauty, As nature durst bestow without undoing; Dwelt, and most happily, as I thought then, And blest the house a thousand times she dwelt in. This beauty in the blossom of my youth, When my first fire knew no adulterate Incense, Nor I no way to flatter, but my fondness. In all the bravery, my friends could shew me, In all the faith my innocence could give me, In the best language my true Tongue could tell me, And all the broken sighs my sick heart lend me, I su'd, and serv'd. Long did I love this Lady, Long was my travel, long my trade to win her, With all the duty of my Soul, I serv'd her. Al. How feelingly he speaks! and she lov'd you too; It must be so. John. I would it had deer Lady, This story had been needless, and this place I think unknown to me, Al. Were your bloods equal? John. Yes, and I thought our hearts too. Al. Then she must love. John. She did, but never me, she could not love me, She would not love, she hated, more she scorn'd me, And in so poor, and base a way abus'd me; For all my services, for all my bounties, So bold neglects flung on me. Al. An ill woman! Be-like you found some Rival in your love then? John. How perfectly she points me to my story. Aside. Madam, I did, and one whose pride, and anger, Ill manners, and worse man she doted on; Doted to my undoing, and my ruine. And but for honor to your sacred beauty, And reverence to the noble Sex, though she fall, As she must fall, that durst be so unnoble, I should say something unbeseeming me. What out of love, and worthy love, I gave her (Shame to her most unworthy minde) to fools, To girls, and fidlers, to her boys she flung, And in disdain of me. Al. Pray ye take me with ye. Of what complexion was she? John. But that I dare not Commit so great a sacriledge 'gainst vertue, She look'd not much unlikely though far, far short. Some thing I see appears, your pardon, Madam, Her eyes would smile so, but her eyes would cousin, And so she would look sad, but yours is pity, A noble Chorus to my wretched story, Hers was disdain and cruelty. Al. Pray Heaven Mine be no worse: he has told me, a strange story, Aside. And said 'twould make me sad! he is no lier. But where begins this poor state? I will have all, For it concerns me truly. John. Last to blot me From all remembrance, what I have been to her, And how, how honestly, how nobly serv'd her, 'Twas thought she set her gallant to dispatch me. 'Tis true, he quarrell'd, without place, or reason. We fought, I kill'd him, Heav'ns strong hand was with me; For which I lost my Countrey, Friends, acquaintance, And put my self to Sea, where a Pirate took me, Forcing this habit of a Turk upon me, And sold me here. Al. Stop there a while, but stay still. In this mans story, how I look? how monstrous? How poor and naked? now I shew what Don John In all the vertue of his life, but aim'd at This thing hath conquer'd with a tale, and carried. Forgive me thou that guid'st me! Never Conscience Touch'd me till now, nor true love: Let me keep it. Leon. She is there, speak to her, you will finde her altered. Enter Pedro and Leonora. Ped. Sister, I am glad to see you, but far gladder, To see you entertain your health so well. Al. I am glad to see you too sir, and shall be gladder Shortly to see you all. Ped. Now she speaks heartily, What do ye want? Al. Onely an hour of privateness, I have a few thoughts. Ped. Take your full contentment, We'll walk aside again; but first to you friend, Or I shall much forget my self. My best friend, Command me ever, ever, you have won it; John. Your Lordship overflows me. Leon. 'Tis but due sir. Exeunt. Al. He's there still. Come sir, to your last part now, Which onely is your name, and I dismiss you. Why, whether go ye? John. Give me leave, good Madam, Or I must be so seeming rude to take it. Al. You shall not go, I swear, you shall not go: I ask ye nothing but your name, ye have one, And why should that thus fright you? John. Gentle Madam, I cannot speak; pray pardon me, a sickness That takes me often, ties my tongue: Go from me, My fit's infectious, Lady. Alm. Were it death In all his horrors, I must ask, and know it. Your sickness is unwillingness. Hard heart, To let a Lady of my youth and place Beg thus long for a trifle. John. Worthiest Lady, Be wise and let me go; you'll bless me for't, Beg not that poison from me that will kill ye. Alm. I only beg your name sir. John. That will choak you, I do beseech you pardon me. Alm. I will not. John. You'll curse me when you hear it. Alm. Rather kiss thee, Why shouldst thou think so? John. Why, I bear that name, And most unluckily, as now it happens, (Though I be innocent of all occasion) That since my coming hither people tell me You hate beyond forgiveness. Now heaven knows, So much respect, (although I am a stranger) Duty, and humble zeal I bear your sweetness, That for the world I would not grieve your goodness: I'll change my name, dear Madam. Alm. People lye, and wrong thy name; thy name may save all others, And make that holy to me, that I hated: Prethee what is't? John. Don John Anthonio. What will this woman do? what thousand changes Run through her heart and hands? no fixt thought in her; She loves for certain now, but now I dare not, Heav'n guide me right. Alm. I am not angry, Sir, With you, nor with your name; I love it rather, And shall respect ye, ye deserve. For this time I licence you to go; be not far from me, I shall call for you often. John. I shall wait, Madam. Exit Iohn. Enter Cuculo. Alm. Now what's the news with you? Cuc. My Lord your father Sent me to tell your Honor, Prince Martino Is well recover'd, and in strength. Alm. Why let him, The stories and the names so well agreeing. Aside: And both so noble Gentlemen. Cuc. And more, an't please you. Alm. It doth not please me neither more nor less on't. Cuc. They'll come to visit you. Alm. They shall break through the dores then. Ex. Almira: Cuc. Here's a new trick of State; this shews foul weather; But let her make it when she please, I'll gain by it. Exit:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. Scæn. 1. Enter Sea-Pirate, one Slave, and Sailors. Pirate. Sold for a slave, saist thou? Slave. 'Twas not so well: Though I am bad enough, I personated Such base behavior, barbarism of manners, With other pranks, that might deter the buyer; That the market yeelded not one man that would Vouchsafe to own me. Pir. What was thy end in't? Slav. To be giv'n away for nothing, as I was To the Vice-roys Doctor; with him I have continued In such contempt, a slave unto his slaves; His horse, and dog of more esteem, and from That villainous carriage of my self, as if I had been a lump of flesh, without a soul; I drew such scorn upon me, that I pass'd, And pride in every place without observance. For which, if you desire to be made men, And by one undertaking, and that easie, Ye are bound to Sacrifice unto my suffrings. The seed I sow'd, and from which you shall reap A plentiful harvest. Pir. To the point, I like not These castles built in the air. Slav. I'll make 'em real, And you the Neptunes of the Sea, you shall No more be Sea-rats. Pir. Art not mad? Slav. Ye have seen The star of Sicilie, the fair Almira, The Vice-roys daughter, and the beauteous Ward Of the Duke of Messina? Pir. Madam Leonora. Slav. What will you say, if both these Princesses This very night, for I will not delay you, Be put in your possession? Pir. Now I dare swear Thou hast Magots in thy brains, thou wouldst not else Talk of impossibilities. Slav. Be still Incredulous. Pir. Why canst thou think we are able To force the Court? Slav. Are we able to force two women, And a poor Turkish slave, where lies your Pinnace? Pir. In a Creek not half a league hence. Slav. Can you fetch Ladders To mount a Garden wall? 1. Sail. They shall be ready. Slav. No more words then, but follow me, and if I do not make this good, let my throat pay for't. Pir. What heaps of Gold, these beauties would bring to us From the great Turk, if it were possible That this could be effected. Slav. If it be not I know the price on't. Pir. And be sure to pay it. Exeunt. Enter Don John with a Letter in his hand. John. Her fair hand threw this from the window to me, And as I took it up, she said, Peruse it, And entertain a fortune offer'd to thee. What may the inside speak—for satisfaction. Breaks it open, and reads. If the contempt I shew'd Don John Anthonio, Whose name thou bear'st, and, in that dearer to me, I do profess I love thee. How! 'tis so, I love thee, this night wait me i'th' Garden, There thou shalt know more, subscrib'd Thy Almira— Can it be possible such levitie Should wait on her perfections? when I was My self, set off withal the grace of greatness, Pomp, bravery, circumstance, she hated me, And did profess it openly; yet now Being a slave, a thing she should in reason Disdain to look upon. In this base shape, And since I wore it, never did her service, To dote thus fondly? And yet I should glory In her revolt from constancy, not accuse it, Since it makes for me. But ere I go further, Or make discovery of my self, I'll put her To th'utmost tryal, i'th' Garden. Well, There I shall learn more. Women! Giddy women, In her the blemish of your sex, you prove There is no reason for your hate or love. Exit. Enter Almira, Leonora, and two Women. Leon. At this unseasonable time to be thus brave, No visitants expected? you amaze me. Al. Are these Jewels set forth to the best advantage To take the eye? 1. Wom. With our best care. 2. Wom. We never Better discharge our duties. Al. In my sorrows, A Princess name (I could perceive it) strook A kinde of reverence in him, and my beauty As then neglected, forc'd him to look on me With some sparks of affection; but now When I would fan them to a glorious flame, I cannot be too curious. I wonder He stays so long. Leon. These are strange fancies. Al. Go Intreat, I do forget my self, command My Governess, Gentleman, her Slave, I should say, To wait me instantly; and yet already [Ex. Wom. He's here. His figure graven on my heart, Never to be raz'd out. Enter Slave, Pirate, and Sailors. Slav. There is the prize, Is it so rich, that you dare not seise upon it? Here I begin: Al. Help Villain: Pir. You are mine. Sail. Though somewhat course, you'll serve after a storm, To bid fair wether welcome. Leon. Ravisher, Defend me Heaven. Al. No aid neer? Wom. Help. Slav. Dispatch. No glory, nor handkercher to stop their mouths? Their cries will reach the guard, and then we are lost. Enter Don John and Woman. John. What shrieks are these? from whence? O blessed Saints! What sacrilege to beauty? Do I talk, When 'tis almost too late to do. Take that. Forces a sword. Slave. All set upon him. Pyrate. Kill him. John. You shall buy My life at a dear rate, you Rogues. Enter Pedro, Cuculo, Borachia, and Guard. Cuc. Down with 'em. Ped. Unheard of treason. Bor. Make in Loggerhead; My son Slave fights like a dragon: Take my bottle, Drink courage out on't. John. Madam, you are free. Ped. Take comfort, dearest Mistress. Cuc. O you Micher, Have you a hand in this? Slave. My aims were high, Fortune's my enemy: To dy's the worst, And that I look for. Pyr. Vengeance on your plots. Ped. The rack at better leisure shall force from 'em A full discovery: Away with 'em. Cuc. Load 'em with irons. Bor. Let 'em have no wine The Guard take the Pyrate and the rest. To comfort their cold heart. Ped. Thou man of men. Leon. A second Hercules. Al. An Angel thus disguis'd. Ped. What thanks? Leon. What service? Bor. He shall serve me by your leave, no service else. John. I have done nothing but my duty, Madam; And if the little you have seen exceed it, The thank due for it pay my watchful Master, And this my sober Mistress. Bor. He speaks truth, Madam, I am very sober. Ped. Far beyond thy hopes Expect reward. Al. We'll straight to Court, and there It is resolv'd what I will say and do. I am faint, support me. Ped. This strange accident Will be heard with astonishment. Come friend, You have made your self a fortune, and deserve it. Exeunt. Enter Viceroy, Messina, Doctor. Mess. Perfectly cur'd? Doct. As such I will present him, The thanks be given to Heaven. Mess. Thrice reverend man, What thanks but will come short of thy desert? Or bounty, though all we possess were given thee, Can pay thy merit? I will have thy Statue Set up in Brass. Vice. Thy name made the sweet subject Of our best Poems; thy unequall'd Cures Recorded to posterity. Doct. Such false glories (Though the desire of fame be the last weakness Wise men put off) are not the marks I shoot at: But if I have done any thing that may challenge Your favors (mighty Princes) my request is, That for the good of such as shall succeed me, A Colledge for Physitians may be With care and cost erected, in which no man May be admitted to a Fellowship, But such as by their vigilant studies shall Deserve a place there; this magnificence, Posterity shall thank you for. Vice. Rest assur'd In this, or any boon you please to ask, You shall have no repulse: Doct. My humblest service Shall ne'r be wanting. Now if you so please, I'll fetch my Princely Patient, and present him. Exit Doctor. Mess. Do, and imagine in what I may serve you, And by my honor with a willing hand I will subscribe to't. Enter Pedro, Almira, Leonora, Don John, Cuculo, Borachia. Cuc. Make way there: Vice. My daughter! How's this? a Slave crown'd with a Civick garland! The mysterie of this? Ped. It will deserve Your hearing and attention. Such a truth Needs not rhetorical flourishes, and therefore With all the brevity and plainness that I can, I will deliver it. If the old Romans, When of most power and wisdom, did decree A Wreath like this to any common Soldier That sav'd a Citizens life, the bravery And valor of this man may justly challenge Triumphant Laurel. This last night a crew Of Pirates brake in Signior Cuculo's house, With violent rudeness, ceasing on my sister, And my fair Mistress, both were in their power, And ready to be forc'd hence; when this man Unarm'd, came to their rescue, but his courage Soon furnish'd him with weapons: In a word, The lives and liberties of these sweet Ladies, You ow him, for the Rovers are in hold, And ready when you please for punishment. Vice. As an induction of more to come, Receive this favor. Mes. With my self, my son Shall pay his real thanks. He comes, observe now Their amorous meeting. Enter Doctor, and Martina. Mart. I am glad you are well Lady: Al. I grieve not your recovery. Vice. So coldly. Mes. Why fall you off? Mart. To shun captivity sir I was too long a slave, I'll now be free. Al. 'Tis my desire you should. Sir my affection To him was but a trifle, which I play'd with I'th' childhood of my love; which now grown elder, I cannot like of. Vice. Strange inconstancy! Mart. 'Tis judgement sir in me, or a true debt Tender'd to Justice rather. My first life Loaden with all the follies of a man, Or what could take addition from a woman, Was by my head strong passions (which o'errul'd My understanding (forfeited to death: But this new being, this my second life, Begun in serious contemplation of What best becomes a perfect man, shall never Sink under such weak frailties. Mess. Most unlook'd for. Doct. It does transcend all wonders. Mar. 'Tis a blessing I owe your wisdom, which I'll not abuse: But if you envy your own gift, and will Make me that wretched creature which I was, You then again shall see me passionate, A lover of poor trifles, confident In mans deceiving strength, or falser fortune; Jealous, revengeful, in unjust things daring, Injurious, quarrelsom, stor'd with all diseases The beastly part of man infects his soul with; And to remember what's the worst, once more, To love a woman, but till that time never. Exit. Vice. Stand you affected so to men, Almira? Al. No Sir; if so, I could not well discharge What I stand bound to pay you, and to nature. Though Prince Martino does profess a hate To womankind, 'twere a poor world for women Were there no other choice, or all should follow The example of this new Hippolitus: There are men, Sir, that can love, and have lov'd truly; Nor am I desperate but I may deserve One that both can and will so. Vice. My allowance Shall rank with your good liking, still provided Your choice be worthy. Alm. In it I have us'd The judgment of my mind, and that made clearer With calling oft to heaven it might be so. I have not sought a living comfort from The reverend ashes of old Ancestors; Nor given my self to the meer name and titles Of such a man, that being himself nothing, Derives his substance from his Grandsires tomb: For wealth, it is beneath my birth to think on't, Since that must wait upon me, being your daughter. No Sir, the man I love, though he wants all The setting forth of fortune, gloss, and greatness, Has in himself such true and real goodness, His parts so far above his low condition, That he will prove an ornament, not a blemish, Both to your name and family. Ped. What strange creature Hath she found out? Leon. I dare not ghess. Alm. To hold you No longer in suspence, this matchless man That sav'd my life and honor, is my husband, Whom I will serve with duty. Bor: My son Slave! Vice. Have you your wits? Bor. I'll not part with him so. Cuc. This I foresaw too. Vice. Do not jest thy self Into the danger of a Fathers anger. Alm. Jest, Sir? by all my hope of comfort in him I am most serious. Good Sir look upon him, But let it be with my eyes, and the care You should owe to your daughters life and safety, Of which without him she's uncapable, And you'll approve him worthy. Vice. O thou shame Of women! thy sad Fathers curse, and scandal: With what an impious violence thou tak'st from him His few short hours of breathing! Doct. Do not add, Sir, Weight to your sorrow in th'ill bearing of it. Vice. From whom, degenerate Monster, flow these low And base affections in thee? what strange philters Hast thou receiv'd? what Witch with damned spels Depriv'd thee of thy reason? Look on me, (Since thou art lost unto thy self) and learn From what I suffer for thee, what strange tortures Thou do'st prepare thy self. Mess. Good Sir, take comfort; The councel you bestow'd on me, make use of. Doct. This Villain, (for such practises in that Nation Are very frequent) it may be hath forc'd By cunning potions and by sorcerous charms This phrensie in her. Vice. Sever 'em. Alm. I grow to him. Vice. Carry the Slave to torture, and wrest from him By the most cruel means, a free confession Of his impostures. Alm. I will follow him, And with him take the Rack. Bor. No, hear me speak, I can speak wisely: Hurt not my son slave, But rack or hang my husband, and I care not; For I'll be bound body to body with him: He's very honest, that's his fault. Vice. Take hence This drunken beast. Bor. Drunk! am I drunk? Bear witness. Cuc. She is indeed distemper'd. Vice. Hang 'em both, If ere more they come near the Court. Cuc. Good sir, You can recover dead men; can you cure A living drunkenness? Doct. 'Tis the harder task; Go home with her, I'll send you something that Shall once again bring her to better temper, Or make her sleep for ever. Cuc. Which you please, sir. Exeunt Cuc. Bor. Vice. Why linger you? rack him first, and after break him Upon the wheel. Ped. Sir, this is more then justice. John. Is't death in Sicily, to be lov'd Of a fair Lady? Leon. Though he be a slave, Remember yet he is a man. Vice. I am deaf To all perswasions: Drag him hence. The Guard take Don John off. Alm. Do Tyrant, No more a Father; feast thy cruelty Upon thy Daughter: but Hell's plagues fall on me, If I inflict not on my self whatever He can endure for me. Vice. Will none restrain her. Alm. Death hath a thousand dores to let out life, I shall find one. If Portia's burning coals, The Knife of Lucrece, Cleopatra's Aspicks, Famine, deep waters have the power to free me From a loath'd life, I'll not an hour outlive him. Ped. Sister. Leon. Dear Cousin. Ex. Alm. Ped. Leon. Vice. Let her perish. Doct. Hear me; Th'effects of violent love are desperate: And therefore in the execution of The Slave be not too sudden. I was present When he was bought, and at that time my self Made purchase of another. He that sold 'em Said that they were companions of one Country. Something may rise from this to ease your sorrows: By circumstance I'll learn what's his condition, I'th' mean time use all fair and gentle means To pacifie the Lady. Vice. I'll endeavour As far as grief and anger will give leave, To do as you direct me. Mess. I'll assist you. Exeunt. Enter Pedro and Keeper. Ped. Hath he been visited already? Keeper. Yes sir, Like one of better fortune; and t'increase My wonder of it, such as repair to him, In their behavior rather appear Servants, then friends to comfort him. Ped. Go fetch him. Exit Keeper. I am bound in gratitude to do more then wish The life and safety of a man that hath So well deserv'd me. Enter Keeper, Don John, Servant. Keeper. Here he is, my Lord. Ped. Who's here? thou art no Conjurer to raise A spirit in the best shape man ere appear'd in. My friend, the Prince of Tarent! doubts forsake me, I must and will embrace him. John: Pedro holds One that loves life for nothing, but to live To do him service. Ped. You are he most certain, Heaven ever make me thankful for this bounty: Run to the Viceroy, let him know this rarity. Ex. K. But how you came here thus? yet since I have you, Is't not enough I bless the prosperous means That brought you hither? John. Dear friend, you shall know all; And though in thankfulness I should begin Where you deliver'd me— Ped. Pray you pass that over, That's not worth the relation. John. You confirm True friends love, to do courtesies, not to hear 'em. But I'll obey you. In our tedious passage Towards Malta, I may call it so, for hardly We had lost the ken of Sicily, but we were Becalm'd, and hull'd so up and down twelve hours, When to our more misfortune we descri'd Eight well mann'd Gallies making amain for us, Of which th'Arch Turkish Pyrate cruel Dragut Was Admiral. I'll not speak what I did In our defence; but never man did more Then the brave Captain that you sent forth with me, All would not do; Courage opprest with number, We were boarded, pillag'd to the skin, and after Twice sold for slaves; by the Pyrate first, and after By a Maltese to Signior Cuculo: Which I repent not, since there 'twas my fortune To be to you my best friend some ways useful. I thought to cheer you up with this short story, But you grow sad on't. Ped. Have I not just cause, When I consider I could be so stupid As not to see a friend through all disguises; Or he so far to question my true love, To keep himself conceal'd? John. 'Twas fit to do so, And not to grieve you with the knowledge of What then I was; where now I appear to you, Your sister loving me, and Martino safe, Like to my self and birth. Ped. May you live long so. How doest thou honest friend? your trustiest servant. Give me thy hand. I now can ghess by whom You are thus furnish'd. John. Troth he met with me As I was sent to prison, and there brought me Such things as I had use of. Ped. Let's to Court, My father never saw a man so welcome, As you'll be to him. John. May it prove so friend. Exeunt: Enter Viceroy, Messina, Martino, Doctor, Captain, Almira, Leonora, Waiting Women, Attendants. Vice. The slave chang'd to the Prince of Tarent, says he? Capt. Yes sir, and I the Captain of the Fort, Worthy of your displeasure, and th'effect oft, For my deceiving of that trust your Excellency Repos'd in me. Doct. Yet since all hath faln out Beyond your hopes, let me become a suiter, And a prevailing one to get his pardon. Al. O dearest Leonora, with what forehead Dare I look on him now? Too powerful love, The best strength of thy unconfined Empire Lies in weak womens hearts Thou art fain'd blinde, And yet we borrow our best sight from thee. Could it be else, the person still the same Affection over me, such power should have To make me scorn a Prince, and love a slave. Mart. But art thou sure 'tis he? Capt. Most certain sir. Mart. Is he in health, strong, vigorous, and as able As when he left me dead? Capt. Your own eyes sir Shall make good my report. Mart. I am glad of it, And take you comfort in it sir, there's hope, Fair hope left for me, to repair mine honor. Mes. What's that? Mart. I will do something that shall speak me Messina's son. Mes. I like not this one word sir. Vice. We'll prevent it. Nay, look up my Almira, now I approve Thy happy choice. I have forgot my anger, I freely do forgive thee. Al. May I finde Such easiness in the wrong'd Prince of Tarent, I then were happy. Leon. Rest assur'd you shall. Enter Don John, Pedro, Servant. Vice. We all with open arms hast to embrace you. Mes. Welcome, most welcome. Mart. Stay. Mes. 'Twas this I fear'd. Mart. Sir, 'tis best known to you, on what strict terms The reputation of mens fame, and honors Depend in this so punctual age, in which, A word that may receive a harsh construction, Is answer'd, and defended by the sword. And you that know so much, will I presume, Be sensibly tender of anothers credit, As you would guard your own. John. I were unjust else. Mart. I have received from your hands, wounds, and deep ones, My honor in the general report Tainted and soil'd, for which I will demand This satisfaction, That you would forgive My contumelious words, and blow, my rash And unadvised wildness first threw on you. Thus I would teach the world a better way, For the recovery of a wounded honor, Then with a savage fury, not true courage, Still to run headlong on. John. Can this be serious? Mart. I'll adde this, He that does wrong, not alone, Draws, but makes sharp his enemies sword against His own life, and his honor. I have paid for't, And wish that they, who dare most, would learn from me, Not to maintain a wrong, but to repent it. Doct. Why this is like your self. Mart. For farther proof, Here sir, with all my interest, I give up This Lady to you. Vice. Which I make more strong, With my free grant. Al. I bring mine own consent, Which will not weaken it. All. All joy confirm it. John. Your unexpected courtesies amaze me, Which I will study with all love and service To appear worthy of. Doct. Pray you understand Sir, There are a pair of Suiters more, that gladly Would hear from you as much, as the pleas'd Viceroy Hath said unto the Prince of Tarent. Mes. Take her, Her dowry shall be answerable to Her birth, and your desert. Ped. You make both happy. John. One onely suit remains, That you would please To take again into your Highness favor This honest Captain: Let him have your grace. What's due to his much merit, shall from me Meet liberal rewards. Vice. Have your desire. John. Now may all here that love, as they are friends To our good fortunes, find like prosperous ends. Exeunt.</field>
