      <field name="fulltext">The PERSONS represented. ORESTES. PYLADES. ÃGYSTHUS. MELISANDER. ARCAS. ÃTHON. LYCON. CLYTEMNESTRA. ELECTRA. Nobles, Officers, Attendants, and Guards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE MYCENÃ.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Scene a grand room in the palace. ARCAS discovered leaning on the pedestal of a pillar. ÃTHON enters to him. ÃTHON. Arcas!âwhat, musing?âOn thy bended brow Anguish and care seem seated!âPainful guests. Say, kind and venerable friend, whose love Supplied a father's part, untimely lost, To form my mind, and fashion it to greatness; Say if a man on earth has dar'd to wrong thee? And here's a sword and arm for thy revenge. ARCAS. Ãthon, I thank thee. Be that sword and arm By the good Gods preserv'd for better service. Son of the man whom most on earth I lov'd, Heir of his virtues, and to my affection, Mingle thy social tearsâthe cause is common. I weep the various wrongs, the countless woes, Pour'd by the hand of him whom angry Jove, For our offences, in his rage hath sent To plague the realms and race of Agamemnon. ÃTHON. You mean that baleful monster, black Ãgysthus: Whom Agamemnon, when he led to Troy, In glorious league, confederated Kings, Nam'd with his Queen, his lovely Clytemnestra, Joint-substitute in delegated sway. O fatal choice! from whence temptation rose T'abuse a monarch's trust, defile his bed, And from his murder mount his sacred throne. ARCAS. Such were indeed the steps by which he reach'd That violated seat, the guardian once, And nurse of ev'ry virtue. Now the source Of hard oppressions and unceasing wrongs. But will ye, Gods! continue to behold Unpity'd, unredress'd, our royal Orphan? See the griev'd people of two kingdoms bend Beneath a tyrant's scourge? Authority Defil'd by guilt? and streams of tears and blood, Sluic'd from barbarity, or drain'd for sport, By one who knows no feelings of a man? Who wanting ev'ry virtue to endear him, On terror would establish usurpation. ÃTHON. Unhappy lot of Argos and MycenÃ¦. But theirs supremely whose exalted rank Superior woes distinguish.âOh! my friend, To what were Agamemnon's offspring born! ARCAS. True! 'tis a theme on which reflection wrings The heart of pity. From all converse, light And comfort sever'd, in a dungeon's depth, Electra wails a murder'd father's fate, A hapless brother's exile; driv'n from home The succour of compassion to implore, And ask of Kings, the equals of his birth, Shelter and foodâthe sordid beggar's boon. ÃTHON. Thrice has Electra suffer'd such hard durance, From the keen malice of his jealous guilt Who construes sorrows crimes, and silence treason. ARCAS. Well might the groans of her impatient grief Untimely issue: well provoke his ire Whose stinging conscience startles at reproach. To minds that fly rememb'ranceâfear remorseâ To guiltâthe tears of innocence are galling: She fears no enemy like that within, Nor contemplation like her own dark deeds. ÃTHON. What then, my friend, must Clytemnestra feel? Seduc'd to frailties which impell'd her on To crimes of dire necessity? ARCAS. What, Ãthon?â Why all that thro' the close disguise of art, Of female vanity and regal pride, The eye of penetration sees her suffer. Else, 'midst the revels of voluptuous pomp, Why is she thoughtful?âsilent?âWhence the sigh Which oft involuntary heaves her breast? Whence her lone wand'rings in sequester'd shades, Her downcast musings, and her tear-swol'n eyes, But from the terrors of a soul dismay'd? Tormented by internal stings, while aw'd By her deluder onceâher tyrant now. ÃTHON. To what bewild'ring ills does error lead!â But turn we from the regions of despair, To the sweet mansion of alluring hope. Say, my good Arcas, from the court of Phocis, Where now our royal fugitive resides, When gain'd you tidings?âAt MycenÃ¦'s gates, When shall we greet deliv'rance with our King? ARCAS. The moon her vary'd course hath travell'd thro', And in a second blunts her silver horns, Since to my hands a trusty messenger Brought letters from my friend, good Melisander, The guide and guardian of his Monarch's flight; Advising royal Strophius was preparing, With succours worthy of so great a cause, To send our blooming hero to assert His sov'reign rights.âBut no Orestes yetâ ÃTHON. Soft!âfor the minion of Ãgysthus comes: The catiff Lycon. He whose guile is task'd To sharpen persecution, and delight, By ev'ry outrage, a licentious monster. SCENE THE SECOND. ARCAS, ÃTHON, and LYCON. LYCON. Hail, noble Argians! With a friendly greeting, I give ye tidings will, I know, be welcome. Oft have I heard ye, humbled to the Gods, With tears invoke 'em in Electra's cause; While to your supplications mine were added, That heav'n would persecute no more the race Of royal Agamemnon; but restore To light, to liberty, to ev'ry comfort, That suff'ring Princess, whose transcendant charms And matchless virtues raise our equal wonder! At length relenting destiny accords, For regal mercy has announc'd her freedom. ARCAS. How, Lycon, free!âSaid'st thou Electra's free?â Speak it againânor in my gladden'd heart Leave gloomy doubt a corner to possess. LYCON. Indulge such wish'dâsuch well-encounter'd joyâ Electra has her freedom. ARCAS. Gracious Pow'rs! I weep my thanks. ÃTHON. Say onâthe cause, good Lycon? LYCON. Some minutes past, while absent from the city, The King, on rural altars, to their Gods, Guardians of fleecy flocks and grazing herds, Pays in rich sacrifice his yearly tribute, A posting stranger to the palace came With letters he proclaim'd of high import, Demanding quick admittance to the throne. The Queen receiv'd him: and no sooner read Th' imparted tidings, than a sudden flame Blaz'd on her cheek; which in an instant chang'd To livid palenessâfrom averted eyes While tears stole silent.âBut regaining soon The firmness of her mind, diffusive smiles Brighten'd her form, and beam'd delight around her! ARCAS. Know you not what those letters might reveal? Or from whose hand the messenger received them? LYCON. Neither. I, on the instant, was commanded To hasten to the King, and urge his coming To meet intelligence so fraught with joy As will reward his swiftest speed to hear. Then, as I parted, loud I heard her cry, Release Electraâset the Princess free. More know I not. And now, by duty urg'd, Like Maia's winged son, when from the throne Of Jove supreme he bears divine behests To kindred deities, I fly to greet Their sacred substitute, the Lord of Argos. SCENE THE THIRD. ARCAS and ÃTHON. ARCAS. Hear ye such blasphemies, immortal Gods! And yet with-hold your thunders? But a bolt Has riven me!âI shudder to reflect Amidst what snares, what perils, we proceed. O, Ãthon! what anxieties intrude While daring enterprize is on the wing, And dubious the decree of awful fate! A royal Orphan's rights, a nation's rescue, A tyrant's overthrow, a King's revenge, Press to decisionâon an hour depend. All-trembling as I ponder the event, At each alarm, my watchful genius starts; Like centinels in cities close besieg'd, Where momentary ruin threatens round. ÃTHON. Should our design miscarry, and Ãgysthus, Deep-vers'd in all the politician's wiles, Trace thro' the mazes of our loyal scheme, Its bold abettors outâwhat will ensue? What means of torture will he not devise? How wanton in inflicted miseries! How weary his invention to be cruel! But be such phantom terrors far away. Our league is form'd of men who dare to sufferâ At least for meâbear witness ev'ry God! And light'nings blast me if my tongue dissemblesâ Should the great purpose of our souls be lost, It is my wish to perish with my hopes. ARCAS. O worthy wish!âBelieve experienc'd age, One who has journey'd thro' the wilds of life, Now, at his ev'ning, on the verge of rest, And happy that his course is near an endâ Of all the blessings here pursu'd by man, You'll find one only permanent and great, The solace of a just and steadfast heart. Be master but of that, and soon you'll learn To set the rage of tyrants at defiance. Truth is a buckler of most sure defence, And honour mightier than the arm of pow'r. Possess'd of those, you'll wage successful war, Be vanquisher of woes, and lord of death. Disgrace may seize, and persecution strike, But vainly both while conscience is unhurt. Tho' wrong'd, assaulted, ruin'd, trampledâcrush'd, Till the last hope of human aid expires, Ev'n then the soul of probity directs A steady look to thrones of kindred Gods! And on unerring justice rests resign'd. ÃTHON. Behold an instance of such suff'ring virtueâ Electra! Whose high dignity of spirit, More than the strong resemblance of her features, Speaks her the daughter of great Agamemnon. SCENE THE FOURTH. ARCAS, ÃTHON and ELECTRA. ELECTRA. Source of all light, celestial PhÅbus, hail!â The common comfort of whose kindly beams, That glad the toiling hindâand chear the slave, Hath to a wretched Princess been deny'd. At length, I breathe in wholsome air again: My groans have larger scopeâmy tears can stream, And leave me yet a corner where to lye, Unwet with trickling anguish. To these walls, Whose ornamental pride my father gave, And which beheld him butcher'd in their bounds, I now may tell my plaintive tale of woes; Ring on their valted roofs resounding cries! And let amusement watch the bandy'd breath, To melt at echo'd miseries in tears. ARCAS. Much-injur'd Princess, more than feeble words, These falling drops express your servant's joy For your implor'd deliv'rance. ELECTRA. Gentle friend, The friend of Agamemnon's injur'd houseâ What, Ãthon too? and melting to behold me! This mournful comfort hath affliction then, I am not wretched to the last extreme; Since fell oppression leaves one gen'rous pair To mingle sorrows with a child of grief. ÃTHON. Sorrow is fruitless. Vengeance better suits A cause like yoursâthe cause of all mankind. ELECTRA. Where is my brother? Does Orestes come, Like hea'vn's high delegate, a righteous Monarch, To call offenders to severe account? Hears he the cries his suff'ring subjects raise, And, like a parent, yearns for their deliv'rance? The call of natureâis he deaf to that? Or comes he, with his falchion flaming high, To strike for vengeance; and, in pious rage, With an assassin's, a usurper's blood, To make oblation to his father's ghost? ARCAS. The womb of fate, in folds impenetrable, Securely still that long'd-for secret wraps. Warm are our wishes, but the hop'd event Is in the hand of heav'n. ELECTRA. But does he comeâ O ease my wild impatience! Does he come Like happy tidings to the pining heart, Like welcome day-light to the frozen pole, A wish'd reliever? Are his subjects tongues Eager to hail him King? and all their swords To aid his cause, and seat him on his throne? ARCAS. We hope he comes. His last dispatches told We might expect him ere the present hour. And here ten thousand hearts, with fierce impatience, Pant to avow and vindicate his claim. ELECTRA. O wherefore loiters then th' unthrifty boy? Had he the spirit that inflames my breast, 'Twould lend his purpose wings. Alas, my friends, Less than a sister does the out-cast son Of Agamemnon feel a father's wrongs, Less feels his own, and hers who suffers for him. Else had my prison-bars ere this been broke, And his vex'd people rescu'd from oppression; While signal justice to the world had shewn, That Heav'n is active in behalf of Kings: That royal hardships claim severe account, And murder'd Majesty will have revenge. ÃTHON. All these he doubtless meditates with caution: But slow the progress is of deep designs. ELECTRA. Had I been slow and cautious when the swords Of Regicides, yet reeking with the blood Of Agamemnon, with a father's blood, Were ev'n uplifted, by determin'd arms, To make a second sacrifice of his, He instant had partook that father's fate. No, 'midst my grief, my horror, my distraction! I paus'd not, stopt not to secure his flight, But seiz'd the first, the only lucky minute That fate allow'd to snatch him from destruction; Which, had I miss'd, could ne'er have been retriev'd. O why delays he? Wherefore lingers thus? Urge, gracious Gods! his haste, and save his honour, Ere busy tongues proclaim such caution fear. ARCAS. The sacred root from whence our scion sprung Hereditary valour so renowns, That slander's self must blush to aim the brand. Nor are the virtues of the Prince unknown. Fame has already chear'd our expectation With ev'ry promise of a god-like mind. Then fear not, Princess, all will yet go well. Have you not mark'd the gath'ring of a storm, When rouling clouds and ghastly gleams of light, In fearful mixture and distemper'd motion, Shew'd as distorted nature writh'd with pain, Ere Jove's accumulated thunders burst With flames and clamours, that appear'd to rend The concave firmament from side to side? Dreadful discharge of heav'nly indignation! And terrible the prelude! So Orestes Will end, I trust, our agonizing pause Of expectation, fear, impatience, hope, Ev'ry anxiety that wrings our souls From this delay; which doubtless he improves To sharpen vengeance to a keener edge, Add to its force, and give it double fury. ELECTRA. Buoy'd by that hope, I struggle with the stream Of rushing injuries, of raging woesâ Nor sink the victim of o'erwhelming anguish. ÃTHON. The Queen approaches!â ELECTRA. Aid me, Resolution. SCENE THE FIFTH. ELECTRA and CLYTEMNESTRA. CLYTEMNESTRA. Electra, is my earnest wish accomplish'd, That chastisement, unwillingly inflicted, Bows to obedience thy too-stubborn spirit? Maternal fondness, ever pow'rful here, Still prompts endeavour to promote thy bliss: While, in severe return, a sullen gloom Unceasing clouds thy brow; and from thy tongue Break taunts invenom'd, daring menaces, To all provokingâand to thee unsafe. ELECTRA. Could aught efface the sad rememb'rance here Of injuries unequall'd, in the fate My god-like father, Agamemnon, met, Disgrac'd in dust, and bleeding on the floor, The victim of their guilt who most had wrong'd him; Could I forget but that, all other ills I'd watch a lonely minute to lament, And wear a smile forever in your sight. But as it is, my tears, as would the blood From my poor father's mangled body, stream Whene'er his ruthless murderers approach. CLYTEMNESTRA. Perverse and arrogant!âHave I no claim? Is nothing due, no portion of regard, To her who gave thee lifeâwho train'd thy youthâ Has sought thy loveâand suffer'd from thy rashness? As mutual parent, sure the claim is mine, From nature's fixt, irrevokable law, To the same rev'rence that you owe a father. ELECTRA. Such claims were cancel'd all, when you devis'd The ruin of my happiness and hopes. A father's fondness and protection lost, Were half my stock: and that by you I lost 'em, Is a reflection that destroys the rest. Since of Electra, then, her mother made This slave of misery, this finish'd wretch, O do not grudge her griefs, who only lives To weep a father's fate, and wish her own. CLYTEMNESTRA. With such reproaches, will you dare inflame A mother's anger, and a Queen's resentment? Was not that father, whom my vengeance slew, A tyrant stain'd with ev'ry human guilt? I had a daughter, dutiful as dear, Lovely alike in features and of soul! Who butcher'd her? and, oh! on what account?â The poor pretence to purchase winds at Aulis, To wing their vessels for devoted Troy. And what ensu'd?âI sought not, nor could shun The tales which with amazement fill'd the world, Of rapes and riots that embroil'd their camp! Till, to compleat his insults, on return, He brav'd me with his phrygian paramour, The ten year's earning of his hostile sword, His wanton, his Cassandra!âThen I struck For injur'd love, insulted dignity, And freed myself at once from wrongs and shame. ELECTRA. Had Clytemnestra fear'd no other wrongs Than those her lord from ruin'd Ilium brought, Great Agamemnon had not timeless bled, Nor Priam's spotless daughter stood accus'd. O there were inmates fiercer than resentment To counsel such a desp'rate, dreadful deed! Guilt, conscious guilt! with all her hideous train, As skulking shame, and ghastly apprehension; The awe of justice, dread of punishment, And ev'ry demon of distemper'd minds. These with the wretchâbut let me hide the rest, Nor picture what distracts me to remember. CLYTEMNESTRA. 'Twas blood for blood: he shed my daughter's blood. For wrongs on wrongs to me, he justly fell ELECTRA. That law admitted, where's the guilt to end? If murder claims a sacrifice in kind, It now is Clytemnestra's turn to bleed. Was Iphigenia's fate, for Greece devoted, A glorious victim! made the bad pretence To slay her father? rob of sov'reign rights An orphan brother? and condemn to bonds A helpless sister?âO prepost'rous plea! Could even phrenzy prompt so dire a thought, As that a mother, in outrageous grief, Might for the fate of one devote the rest, Husband and children; and to crown the deed, Grace with their spoils, and wed their mortal foe? CLYTEMNESTRA. Too stabbing truths!âhow keen to gall'd remembrance!â [Aside. Licentious railerâwill nor decency, Nor apprehension rein thy ranc'rous tongue?â Then let me warn theeâtrespass thus no farther, Lest in th' offended queen the mother's lost. Too long I've borne thy insults.âHenceforth know, 'Tis my resolve, with rigour to exact The dues of dignity and rights of nature. Cease provocation then, or, by my wrongs, I yield thee to the vengeance of the king. ELECTRA. The king!âthe traitor, regicideâusurper! I dare his maliceâfor I dare to die. Let those be tame whose souls, defil'd with guilt, May justly dread a terrible hereafter. I know no fear. My hands were never stain'd By sceptres torn from a defenceless child, Or with a monarch's, or a husband's blood! O Gods! my griefs transport me! Tell the tyrant, I scorn his indignationâdare his furyâ Hate himânor fear to let my death enhance The great account, which soon my brother's sword Shall in a storm of vengeance well acquit. CLYTEMNESTRA. To thy confusion, menacer, be told, Those threats are vainâthat brother is no more. A posting phocian has reveal'd the tidings, With royal greetings from his aged king, Who sends, in-urn'd, the ashes of Orestes, To rest with his progenitors forever. ELECTRA. Relieve me, Gods! in mercy, oh! relieve me! CLYTEMNESTRA. What now are all thy empty vaunts of vengeance? Thy fancy'd triumph, a frail, airy vision, Fades like the tincture of an ev'ning cloud, Whose dazzling figure, bright as burnish'd gold, This moment blazes, and the next is lost. ELECTRA. O pow'rless anguishâimpotence of torture! CLYTEMNESTRA. Mark what imports thee much. Thy impious wishes, Thou se'st are blasted all; thy hopes cut off; And thou thyself, defenceless, in the pow'r Of those thou'st dar'd to injure and provoke. Yetâfor I feel a tenderness within me Which, spight of thy ingratitude, still pleads, And struggles with resentmentâyet be safe. Enjoy thy freedom:âbut, I warn thee, use it With all the caution that becomes thy state, To me respectful, to the king obedient. This last fond effort that affection makes, Should rashness render vain, all earth and heav'n Must sure absolve me, if I give thee up, The victim of insulted sov'reign-pow'r. SCENE THE SIXTH. ELECTRA, ARCAS and ÃTHON. ELECTRA. Then all my dreams of happiness resolve In disappointment, and substantial woe! O gentle friends! the meteor hope, that play'd In fancy's airy region, now has spent Its pleasing firesâand all is void and chearless. Comfort is vanish'dâpeace for ever fledâ All that was worth a wish, ourselves, our country, Perish with poor Orestes. ÃTHON. Hah! Orestes? ELECTRA. Oh! he is gone for ever. ARCAS. Then these eyes Last to behold the day, when nothing's left To stir an old man's pulseâor wake one care. ELECTRA. Wretched and hopeless since we're thus become, Let us unite our miseries together: Swell up the load with ev'ry added grief, Till its own pressures crush all feeling out, And gasping nature groans sad being off. I have no duties now for life remaining, But, when they come, to clasp my brother's ashes, Perform the solemn, sad sepulchral rites, And sacrifice to the infernal Gods For his departed soul. Be those accomplish'd, And death shall be my deity. I'll pray The meagre pow'r to take to his embrace The last of Agamemnon's hapless race. End of the FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Scene a royal apartment with a throne. Enter CLYTEMNESTRA, attended. CLYTEMNESTRA. Leave me [Ex. Attendants.âand let me quit the hard restraint Of counterfeit appearanceânor obstruct Nature's impetuous impulse. Painful probes Of searching thought, what tortures do ye cause! My wrong'd, abandon'd, ruin'd, lifeless child! Conscience convicts me, as the baneful source, Of all thy suff'ringsâdeath! Pride, indignation! Ye daring counsellors, but dastard champions, How fell your instigationsâfalse your smiles! Weak vanity of hope, from evil deeds To gather bliss. Still vainer the endeavour, With doubling anguishâanguish to disguise. What boots it wretchedness the world should think We are what we but seem?âO Agamemnon! Orestes! how much happier are the wrong'd Than those who injure!âSweet were all my hours Whilc virtue led their course. But guilt's dominion Perplexes, harrasses, distractsâconfounds! Fly, mortals, timely the seducer viceâ When once enthral'd, ye plunge from crime to crime, Disabled for resistance. [Shouting.âHah!âÃgysthus! The cause and scourge of all my foul offences. SCENE THE SECOND. CLYTEMNESTRA, ÃGYSTHUS, and LYCON. ÃGYSTHUS. [Shouting without. Repeat your acclamations, till the skies Resound with clam'rous echos! O my Lycon! How kindles rapture from this blaze of joy! Fan the aspiring flameâexalt my blissâ Augment these heart-felt triumphs. Hah! my queenâ Whence that thy eyes avoid encount'ring mine? By the strong transports struggling here for vent, Those heaving sighs and stealing tears betray Disloyal love for Agamemnon's race. CLYTEMNESRTA. 'Tis my misfortune, if within this breast Such jarring ties and warring passions meet As to distraction agonize my soul. The duties of a wife I own and practiseâ But can't divest me of a mother's feelings. ÃGYSTHUS. Such feeling's frailty, folly! moreâ'tis guilt; It marrs my happiness, by rude intrusion Upon the hour to festive joy devoted. Learn, if thou'dst hold thy int'rest in my heart, The foremost virtue for a wife to practice, And make my will the leader of thy own. CLYTEMNESTRA. Hear him, ye Gods! to whose celestial thrones His vows of gentleness were once addrest, Hear him reproach me for the tender tears His own severities and crimes provoke! Can I resist the all-subduing strokes Of pow'rful nature, knocking at my heart? Can Iâthou hard exacter of obedienceâ The hours I must remember, when thy tongue Was taught to sooth me with the softest strains. The sweets of Hybla honey'd o'er thy words, While I was won from innocence and bliss With feign'd observance and obsequious vows. But like a transient dream dominion past, And I awoke to suffer and to serve. ÃGYSTHUS. 'Tis the ungovern'd vanity of woman, Fond of authority and proud of rule, Which tasks our tongues to vile dissimulation. Your wayward humours are your worst deluders, By which you're counsel'd, and by which deceiv'd. Prerogative, the gift of Gods to man, When madly you invade, and grieve to miss, To error give the gall of disappointment, Nor blame the husband who asserts his right. CLYTEMNESTRA. Enjoy such pow'r, and exercise, unenvy'd, Your lordly, high preheminence. But why Must rooted passions, all the tender strings That touch and harmonize the soul be broke? Why am I grudg'd the privilege to breathe A mournful sigh for an unhappy son, Who owes his wrongs, his wretchednessâhis death, To my misdoings? Ev'ry savage bruteâ The pard and lioness that scour the desert Protect and feed their offspring. On the cliff, The parent-pelican, in want of food, Relieves her young ones from her spouting veins! While I, more fell than nature's commoners, Gave up my helpless unoffending child To ev'ry want and woe! And now am told, That ev'n a tear descending on his grave Is in a mother guilt!âWhat would'st thou, tyrant? I cannot harden at thy will to stone. ÃGYSTHUS. I would have pleasure seen, and sparkling joy, Now while the public eye is sharply pointed, Observant of all looks. Such qualms as these Intrude untimely, and may keep alive The dying embers of seditionâserve To sap allegiance ev'n in loyal hearts. Then give me smiles:âand if they can't be real, Exert thy sex's ready art, dissembling, To vamp thy visage with a feign'd delight. CLYTEMNESTRA. I long have labour'd to deceive myself, As well as cheat the prying eyes of others: Have steel'd my heart against a daughter's tears, And link'd obedience with a guilty pride To glory in the deeds my soul condemn'd. But such endeavours all have turn'd against me, And will, while in my bosom there's a judge Whom no delusions can amuse or blind. Conscience presents the mirror to my sight That shews my crimes in such a hideous glare As pains reflexion! But the curse redoubles With bowing nature to the hard constraint Of forcing smiles, and counterfeiting gladness. ÃGYSTHUS. Of all the phantoms that infest the mind, There's none so fatal as a frail remorse. The soul that's staunch repels its worst assaults, But fools and women fight to be o'ercome. Yet timely learn precaution, lest I'm urg'd To think, for my security and peace, The course of slaughter once was stopt too soon. CLYTEMNESTRA. If loss of life were all I had to fear, I'd wish that fury to be rous'd again. But what must follow? There my guilt appalls me! When at the bar of Minos I appear, A slaughter'd husbandâan abandon'd son, Will witness 'gainst me to my soul's undoing. Can fraud or artifice avail me there, Where all dissimulation must be vain? Noâwhile for crimes reveal'd, just sentence issues, The shudd'ring shades will hiss, the furies yell! And lash me with relentless stripes for ever. ÃGYSTHUS. Then since I'm master of the fate you fear, As love and duty both have lost their influence, On that foundation I'll erect my pow'r. Mark my commands; you know my doom decisive, My will immoveableâmy heart relentless. Henceâand prepare to greet this embassy As may become the consort of Ãgustus, Or, by the majesty of mighty kings, My indignation shall dismiss thy soul To that tremendous trial. CLYTEMNESTRA. Righteous Gods! What curses spring from guilt!âBut crimes like mine Demand ev'n this, to manifest your justice. SCENE THE THIRD. ÃGYSTHUS and LYCON. ÃGYSTHUS. Now, Lycon, to fruition ripens hope, Alike my vengeance and ambition triumph. 'Twas thou, my friend, and I must bless thy zeal, Who fir'd me first to all I have atchiev'd. Why should I gall rememb'rance with the motives? A progeny destroy'dâa parent fed With his own murder'd offspring! O Thyestes! Well might the radient ruler of the day, Struck with a sight so horrid, turn his steeds, And back again, adown the slope of heav'n, Muffled in darkness, hurry from the sight! I only 'scap'd of my devoted houseâ So Jove decree'd, to be his instrument Of retribution on the race of Atreus. Was it not precious havoc? Warm with conquestâ His hopes accomplish'd, and his heart at easeâ A king and heroâround his glitt'ring crown The laurel twiningâso to send the soul Of Agamemnon to the shades beneath, To wander there a discontented ghost, Was worthy hazardâ'twas divine revenge! LYCON. Regaining thus your right, MycenÃ¦'s crown, And, from their own example, adding theirs, The diadem of Argos, nobly rais'd A doubly triumph on their desolation. ÃGYSTHUS. But thy good service unrewarded yet With aught but grateful thoughts and kind regard, Reproaches, Lycon, thy too thankless master. Look round thee then, for all can charm thy wishâ I lay my pow'r, my pomp, my wealth before theeâ As of a father ask, whose ready hand Would deal unceasing bounties to a son, The darling of his bosomâSpeak, my Lycon. LYCON. The conscious sense of having done my duty Is full reward. Untainted by ambition, And well-convinc'd that virtue pays herself, I sought no higher solace.âYetâ ÃGYSTHUS. Say onâ Nor wrong my friendship by unkind reserve. LYCON. I dare not. ÃGYSTHUS. By the Gods! thou shaltâ 'Tis my command. Whatever is thy wish, I call the sacred host of heav'n to witness, Ev'n to my kingdom's half, it shall be thine. LYCON. Let me entreat you urge this theme no farther? ÃGYSTHUS. Can'st thou, the only faithful, gen'rous friend Dominion gave a monarchâcan'st thou ask A boon that I shall hesitate to grant? Noâspeak, and make we happy in bestowing. LYCON. That I should hope what were a prize for kings, And own I love so much above my rank As Agamemnon's daughterâwere presumption Too great for me to hazardâyou to pardon. ÃGYSTHUS. Bid Ãthon instant bring the princess hither. [Lycon goes out. By all the joys of friendship, long I've mark'd Love's fond effectsâstill wond'ring to behold Regard I judg'd too partial, ne'er suspecting The tender motive.âWell was it for her [Lycon returns. She had an advocate so near my heart. Oft when the scope of her impetuous temper Had wing'd resentment half to desperation, While high-soar'd vengeance was prepar'd to stoop And tear her feeble quarry, thou hast stept 'Twixt frantic rashness and fierce-kindling rage, With lenient guile to ward the bending blow! Such kindness spoke strong passion; and I bless The fair occasion fortune now affords To crown thy wishes with my full concurrence. LYCON. O my transported soul! Behold, she comes! Her looks more mournful than the weeds she wears! Lamenting excellence! But, from this hour, Be all thy sorrows and misfortunes chang'd To scenes of happiness and songs of joy. SCENE THE FOURTH. ÃGYSTHUS, LYCON, ÃTHON, and ELECTRA, in Mourning. ÃGYSTHUS. Come near, Electra. Thou'rt, at length, convinc'd The Gods are guardians of the thrones of kings. Forever blasted thou behold'st thy hope To wrest the sacred scepter from my grasp, And, in a torrent of rebellious rage, O'erwhelm my fortune, and involve my life. But from my soul I pardon what is past: And with the ashes of thy lifeless brother Would bury all rememb'rance of my wrongs. Nay more: to shew how truly I'm thy friend, My bounteous heart rejoices to bestow The sum of blessings thou'dst have torn from me, Peace, safety, greatness, and the joys of love. Take with this worthy man, whom I esteem, All that thy wish would reach. His heart is thine. Unite affection in one ardent flame, And on his happiness erect thy own. ELECTRA. To all the wrongs which I so long have suffer'd, To all the sorrows that oppress me now, Sicken my soul, and sink it to despair, Was there this insult wanting, awful Gods! To make the measure of my woes complete? But I'll sustain ev'n thisâwill welcome allâ From hope the gath'ring stock may grow so vast, That, like an o'ercharg'd building, its own weight Will bear it down, a bulg'd and broken ruine. LYCON. In pity to thyselfâto him whose heart Hath suffer'd long in sharpest agonies, A wishing, trembling, watching, bleedingâ ELECTRA. Henceâ Avaunt, presumptuous reptile. Glorious Gods! Avenge this vile attempt at profanation. The blood deriv'd from your celestial source, And stream'd thro' kings and heroes down to me, Shall ruffian hopes dishonour?âKnow thou tyrant, [To Ãgysthus. That Agamemnon's daughter, first of kings! Asserts her high pre-eminence of birth, To treat this outrage with the scorn it merits. ÃGYSTHUS. Know'st thou not, boaster, all thy pride of soul A single breath of mine can blast for ever?â Then be advis'd; suppress such arrogance, Or sure perdition catches thee. Thy brother, Who seem'd to carry thunder in his name, Remember, minion, is for ever lost. ELECTRA. I know it wellâknow ev'ry hope is gone; And loosing them, I also loose my fears. What has thy pow'r I dare not to contemn? Thy racks and engines? Bring 'em instant forth: And thou shalt see, by my heroic suff'ring, That I am worthy of my father's fame. ÃGYSTHUS. Exalted phrenzy!âBe the trial thineâ Nay, Lycon, I were abject to relentâ Nor must thou intercedeâ LYCON. For your renownâ An eagle wreaks no anger on a wren. ÃGYSTHUS. I'll crush the scorpion, whose invenom'd spite Watches to wound and poison my repose. By all my glories! 'tis her wish, her pride, To thwart my inclination, mar my hopes, And jar to discord ev'ry passion in me. But she shall sufferâ SCENE THE FIFTH. ÃGYSTHUS, ELECTRA, LYCON, ÃTHON and ARCAS. ARCAS. Sov'reign lord of Argos, Th' ambassador from Phocis is arriv'd, Who brings the ashes of Orestes. ÃGYSTHUS. Henceâ [To Electra. But on her offering to go out he stops her, by catching hold of her arm. No, thou domestic furyâthou shalt stayâ I'll riot in thy anguish. To the queen, Ãthon, and tell her I demand her presence. SCENE THE SIXTH. ÃGYSTHUS, ELECTRA, LYCON and ARCAS. ARCAS. Is it your royal pleasure to receive him? ÃGYSTHUS. It is. Be thine the office to conduct them. SCENE THE SEVENTH. ÃGYSTHUS, ELECTRA and LYCON. ÃGYSTHUS. The smiling minute is at length arriv'd That crowns my wishes. 'Twill enhance the joy A breathless rival at my feet must give To see yon demon made completely wretched. O I enjoy thy anguish! ev'ry throb Of that proud heart beats extacy to mine. SCENE THE EIGHTH. ÃGYSTHUS, LYCON, CLYTEMNESTRA, ÃTHON, Nobles, Attendants and Guards. ÃGYSTHUS. Now, Clytemnestra, let a wife's obedience Add to the dignity becomes a queen. Firm thy resolves, and let no treach'rous tear Or rebel sigh disgrace thee. Be thyself. Be what thou wert when first thou crown'st my love, And rule my heart unrival'd. [dead march behind.âHark! they come. [Ãgysthus and Clytemnestra take their seats on the throne, while Electra and the rest range themselves on one side of the stage. SCENE THE NINTH. ÃGYSTHUS, CLYTEMNESTRA, ELECTRA, ÃTHON, LYCON, Nobles, Attendants and Guards. To them the Funeral Entry, made in the following order, while a dead march is performing by the whole Orchestra. Phocian Guards. Gentlemen Attendants. The Banner. The Spear. The Spurs. The Gauntlets. The Sword. The Shield. The Corselet. The Helmet, with a Plume. The Urn, borne by ORESTES and PYLADES. Gentlemen Attendants. ARCAS. MELISANDER. Phocian Guards. After Arcas has conducted in Melisander, he takes his place among the Argian Courtiers, while trumpets are sounding a flourish on that side from behind. MELISANDER. With royal greetings to the king of Argos, Our phocian monarch, mighty Strophius, sends These last remains of Agamemnon's son. A prince whose mind and person were adorn'd With ev'ry grace becoming his high birth. But the great Gods, as if they deem'd our world Unworthy such perfections, let us see The promise only, their maturer bloom, Alas, preventing; for in life's green morn They wither'd by the blast of blind mischance. All then a grieving king and people could, Was piously perform'd. His body burnt With regal splendors on a fun'ral pile, Shrunk to those ashes, which we weeping yield To the last mansion of his great forefathers. ÃGYSTHUS. So wish'd a present was the surest means To gain thy master's greetings welcome here. But with its cause let enmity be buried. Orestes is no more: and royal Strophius, By deeds of worth, may challenge future friendship. Inform us next of what we wish to learnâ The means and manner of Orestes' death. MELISANDER. The monarch we obey ordain'd rewards To such as should excel in martial skill: Which kindled ardor in the nobly born To list for glory in the gallant strife. The prince, our darling Pylades, began The manly exercise, and well perform'd A soldier's part against his friend Orestes. Before th' applauding court, alike successful, On horses long, and long on foot they strove, The palm still doubtful, and their pleas the same. At length in chariots, drawn by foaming coursers That proudly-snorting champt their burnish'd bitts, Encount'ring lance to lance, they stoutly stood, Urg'd their fierce steeds, or with a dext'rous rein Turn'd them by nice command to all advantage; 'Till, as Orestes aim'd a vig'rous stroke, The chariot-floor, unfaithful to his tread, Plung'd him amidst his horses. Starting, they Flounder'd and tore, and trampled him to earth. In vain the king and each beholder rush'd, Eager to save himâinstant was his fate. Struck with the dire mishap, th' assembly wept! And having bath'd with tears the bleeding corse, Bore it from off the execrated field. ÃGYSTHUS. Place in the royal sepulchre the urn. And, strangers, take from me a cordial welcome To share in all the pleasures of my court. Arcas and Ãthon, to your mutual trust I leave the care of hospitable rites. Let due attention speak the warmth of friendship With which I greet again the king of Phocis. [The trophies, being delivered by the Phocians to Argians, are carried out with the urn on one side of the stage, while the court retires on the other. SCENE THE TENTH. ARCAS, ÃTHON, MELISANDER, ORESTES, PYLADES, and the Phocian train. ARCAS , after a considerable pause. Forgive us, Phocians, if with hearts less chearful We pay our portion of a just regard. Thou, on whose brow the venerable marks Of age and long experience are imprest, Wilt pardon us, that sorrow's drops distil For the sad fate of Agamemnon's heir. We owe the tribute to his father's worth, Whose sceptre made us once a happy people. MELISANDER. The son no less deserv'd it, had you known him. ARCAS. A wish'd-for blessingâbut the Gods with-held it. I had a friend was partner of his flightâ Indulge affection to enquire the lot Of virtuous Melisander. Does he live? Did he survive his much-lov'd master's fate? My hoary age was nourish'd by the hope That I once more should clasp him in these arms, And, with him, see a prince restor'd to rule Who would have blest my country. But the fates Decree these dimning eyes must close forever Without that happiness. MELISANDER. Thou good old man! Sensation's soft'ning, soul-subduing nerve, Makes gushing tears outstrip the speed of words To tellâthy Melisander stands before thee. Twelve anxious years have plough'd my aged form, I find, beyond the traces of a friend. But seeing thee, my heart at once confest It's fellowship, and yearn'd for this embrace. ARCAS. Thou Melisander?âgracious Gods!â'tis he! O'erpow'ring transport! extacy of joy! Which yet one sad rememb'rance sorely checksâ The cause that I behold thee. MELISANDER. I mistook, Or thy companion, here, the king call'd Ãthon. ARCAS. The same. MELISANDER. Report has told me of his worth: And to my friendship do I thus receive him. The hour you long have wish'd at length's arriv'd. Here, noble Argians, hail your sov'reign. ARCAS , kneeling with Ãthon. Gods!â ÃTHON. All-righteous pow'rs!âwe weep the thanks we owe ye. ORESTES. Friends to a cause that's worthy of your virtueâ How do ye charm me with such kind regard! MELISANDER. Up, upânor rashly risk suspicious eyesâ We walk upon the verge of ruinâthink A monarch's fortune rests on our precaution. This stratagem maturely was contriv'd To gain an unsuspected ent'rance here. Nor durst we trust to messenger or letter, And therefore unappriz'd you thus behold us. This is the phocian prince, whose royal father Sends fifteen thousand swordsmen to support Our arduous enterprize. Scarce one day's march They lag behind. We hasted to prepare Our trusty friends for arming in our causeâ No tokens more of duty or respectâ They're dangerous. We must be close and speedy. ARCAS. With Ãthon, singly, let the charge remain To sooth your present hour; while I away, Throughout the city, to our trusty friends These joyful tidings to impart, and plan The means for meeting, where they may express Their vows and transports at their monarch's feet. I know that ev'ry hand and heart is ready To risk the sacrifice of all held precious In daring to assert their sov'reign's claim. To the safe guardianship of heav'n I leave ye, That heav'n whose justice makes our cause its own. SCENE THE ELEVENTH. ORESTES, PYLADES, MELISANDER, ÃTHON, and the Phocian train. MELISANDER. Thus far, my prince, secure with fortune's gale Our prosp'rous pinnace glides. Your eyes have seen The spoilers of your father's crown and life: Who having reap'd in fields of high renown A glorious harvest, brought the purchase home, And, in full prospect of enjoyment, plum'd Indulgent hope for long successive years. But he, who triumph'd o'er the fiercest foes, Was in his palace, which his guards surrounded, By treason butcher'd: by the wiles and hands Of those whom most on earth he had oblig'd, A wife he doated on, and trusted friend. Nor meant they there to stop. His kingdom's hope, Yourself, alike was destin'd, tho' a child. But the good Gods, by timely interposing, For righteous vengeance rescu'd you from slaughter: And here their sacred delegate you stand, To drive the dreadful bolt. Discharge it then With all the dignity becomes a king! Be steady, and be just. No wanton rage Must be indulg'd. Yet awfully serene, Redress your subjects, sister and yourself: Punish oppression, root out tyranny, Tear usurpation from the throne it stains, And doom the shedders of your father's blood. ORESTES. O Melisander! give my heart a little, A little leisure, that I may subdue The grief, astonishment and indignation, With which 'tis heaving, heavy and opprest. Yes, my great father, royal Agamemnon, You shall have signal, shall have full revenge. My suff'ring people too shall have redress: And thou, Electraâthere my bosom bleedsâ Ye saw, my friends, her speechless agonies! Ye saw her pietyâye saw her love. PYLADES. To ease that anguish asks your earliest care. Occasion must be watch'd for time and place To steal upon her in a lonely minute, And give her the delight to see you safe. ORESTES. O Pylades! the wish'd-for hour advancesâ The field of glory opens full before me! From ease I start, from ev'ry soft'ning joy, Whose bliss enervates, and whose pleasures cloy. An active warmth my kindling soul inspires, And in my bosom rage resistless fires! Come thou, my friend, and let us jointly raise One common glory, one immortal praise! Our brave atchievements, and our social flame, Together blazon on the rolls of fame. End of the SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Scene the royal sepulchre, in which is a range of monumental shrines, those of Agamemnon and Orestes standing most conspicuous, adorned with military trophies, and hung with fresh garlands; the pavement before them being strewed with herbs and flowers. ELECTRA is discovered, with locks of human hair in one hand, and a golden vessel for sacrificing in the other. ELECTRA. The shrines with garlands hung, the floor around Strew'd with the fragrant spoils of blooming spring, These tresses, newly shorn, I consecrateâ And with libations now invoke your ghosts, Departed heroes!âwhether in the skies, Among your kindred Gods, ye take your seats, Or dwell with happy shades, where peaceful groves Their everlasting breezy-umbrage spread, Vouchsafe acceptance of the solemn rites A weeping daughterâsister, here performs; Who longs to join ye in your blissful state, And to our common persecutors leave A world that virtue learns apace to scorn. Where thou, great hero, like the hunted hart, Panting and groaning on the crimson'd earth, Dy'd by the hands of violence and guilt. Where thou, sweet youth, like the fresh-op'ning rose, Nipt by the blasting breath of chilly morn, Faded a lovely spoil on foreign land. Nor present was I to perform my part, With streaming tears to wash thy stiff'ning limbs, Perfume the pile with odorif'rous gums, Light with a hallow'd torch the fun'ral fire, Collect thy dust, and close it in it's urn. Those offices by strangers when perform'd, Depriv'd thy dear remains of kindred dues, While I with fruitless wishesâfruitless vowsâ SCENE THE SECOND. ELECTRA and ORESTES. ELECTRA. Phocianâbegone. This mansion, and these rites Forbid intrusion. ORESTES. Pardon, princely maid, Th'unwilling trepass heart-felt anguish promptsâ The impulse fervent piety obeys. With rev'rence I approach the awful shrine Where royal Agamemnon's ashes rest. Orestesâwas my friendâso firm a union Affection rivetted, our souls were one. He own'd no tye more dear, but that of brotherâ And there fraternal tendernessâ ELECTRA. Forbearâ ORESTES. Electra was his constant theme of talk. For her his wishes took unbounded scope, His pray'rs were ever ardent. For her wrongs, With speechless agonies his heart would heave, His sighs would issue, and his tears descend. ELECTRA. Stop, stranger, stopâor your relation kills me. ORESTES. To her, transported! he would often cry, I owe my life!âwhen sacrilegious hands Struck to the earth the author of my being, And I, a helpless innocent, was doom'd The next to sufferâshe was my preserver. Inspir'd by tenderness, she instant seiz'd The only means and minute fate would grant To save me from the meditated blow. ELECTRA. That active zeal since fortune renders fruitless, Would he and I had with our father fell. What hardships then, what hapless, heavy hours Of grief and misery had both escap'd! He had not rov'd a wretched, royal beggar, Nor I, 'mid'st daily wrongs, been curst to see My father's fame insulted, and his crown The prey, the prize, of those who shed his blood. Yet 'gainst such ills did fortitude bear up, Sustain'd by treach'rous hope; whose flatt'ries told, That I should live to triumph in my turn: Should see my brother with his brandish'd sword At once asserting vengeance and his throne. But now those hopes desert me; and I'm left The lonely relique of a ruin'd house, To suffer wrongs, sustain distressful lise, And weep misfortunes that admit no cure. ORESTES. Infectious anguishâhow I catch the weakness! ELECTRA. Hah! tears of pity! they are gen'rous, kind, And soothing to distress so great as mineâ Who find, alas, no fellowship in sorrow. ORESTES. Unfeeling world! ELECTRA. But to the winds and skies I give, howe'er, my gath'ring anguish vent. The clouds, more merciful than monster man, Oft melt in mournful drops at my complainings. Ah fruitless, vain recourse!âmy father, hearâ Hear me, Orestesâhear these suppliant criesâ Assist to soften the relentless fates, And gain my soul her rescue from despair. ORESTES. Yet, pious mourner, for your precious peaceâ ELECTRA. Peace is no moreâthen wherefore should I live? Order is lostâand why exists the world? O put a period to it awful Gods! Since ev'ry bond of social life is broke. Awake confusion! Let full rapine rage, Fierce outrage howl, and desolation triumph! There's now no crime too horrid to commitâ Too foul for human practice. Sons may seize Decrepit fathers by their hoary locks, And crush the last remains of creeping age! Relentless mothers from their milky breasts, With savage hands their smiling infants tear, And on the flinty pavements dash their brains. When thrones are violatedâwhen the torch Of Hymen streams a suffocating flame, Iniquity hath wing'd it's utmost flight. What can it farther? Whither must it soar? Gods! do ye ponder till presumptuous mortals Assault your mansions, ev'n invade your skies, Ere from your hands the vengeful bolts are hurl'd That shall to atoms shake this solid earth, And make laps'd nature, thro' her myriad forms, Burst with one pang, and in one groan expire? ORESTES. In pity ceaseâ ELECTRA. Away, away, awayâ Phrenzy's a friend, although a wretched one: And reason, when distress is past relief, Our worst of enemies.âA draught of Lethe!â O for forgetfulnessâ ORESTES. Her mind's disorder'd! Good heav'n relieve her. ELECTRA. 'Tis a fruitless pray'r. I am not franticâI were blest to be so. What could I suffer by the loss of reason, But loss of griefs that reason cannot cure? ORESTES. Distressful anguish! ELECTRA. Twelve unhappy years To bear the load of miserable life, With but one hope to chear me! and, at last, My very goal in viewâto loose ev'n thatâ And yet survive it!âIf thou art a friend, Push me from off this pinacle of woe, And aid my plunge to everlasting peace. ORESTES. In ev'ry pang that wrings thy throbbing heartâ In all thy wrongs, thy suff'rings, I partake, With agonies unspeakableâ ELECTRA. No more. Hope not with fruitless pity to retard A soul that's bent on partingâ ORESTES. Hear meâ ELECTRA. Noâ I'll be no more deluded. Life's a curse That only foes can wish me to endure. ORESTES. Mine is the voice of tendernessâof loveâ ELECTRA. Provoke not desperation!âOn the den Of dragon-wrath thou tread'st!âRetreat in time, Nor hazard rashness. ORESTES. Little do'st thou think, Electra, what an int'rest thou hast here. ELECTRA. Presumptuous youth!âwould arroganceâah! noâ He but compassionatesâyet for thy lifeâ ORESTES. I live but in the hope to cherish thine. ELECTRA. Say'st thou?âThe fates are hov'ring on the wingâ The clouds thick congregateâthe whirlwind wakesâ The furies gather round! ORESTES. My sisterâ ELECTRA. Hah!â ORESTES. What consternationâ ELECTRA. Said'st thouâsaid'st thouâ ORESTES. I'm indeed thy brotherâ ELECTRA. Ever-living Gods! It cannot beâit is delusion allâ [fainting. ORESTES , catching her in his arms. My sister!âmy Electra?âHeav'ns! she dies! O ideot rashness!âmy unguarded transports Have kill'd the innocent I wish'd to succour! Hah!âbreathes she not?âshe lifts the lids of light! And beams warm comfort on my frozen heart! O'erpow'ring rapturesâextacy of bliss! ELECTRA. Thouâthou Orestes?âlet me view thee well! Oh! no, I am notâcannot be deceiv'd. Thro' all thy formâeach featureâev'ry limbâ I trace my father, god-like Agamemnon! O'erwhelming happinessâhow wild thy flow! ORESTES. Exalted eloquence of eyes and souls! O looks that touch beyond the pow'r of words! Tears are true utt'rers of our genuine joy! ELECTRA. Have the good Gods, propitious to my pray'rs, At last restor'd thee?âfrom the gloomy depths Of dear despair enlarg'd, my soul now soars At once to heav'n, and tastes extatic bliss! Howâlet me call my wand'ring spirits homeâ To ask thee by what providential means Thou now art presentâand from whence the tale That taught us to lament thy timeless fate? ORESTES. 'Twas to deceive the ever-watchful tyrant, And lull within his mind suspicion's guard While I obtain'd an interview with thee, And with the friends of Agamemnon's house, That we might forge such thunders as will blast This ruthless ravager who stains my throne. SCENE THE THIRD. ORESTES, ELECTRA, PYLADES and MELISANDER. MELISANDER. Princess of Argos, from your pious hand This sacred charge your faithful slave receiv'd, Which now, with joy that words but ill would paint, He renders back to you and to his country. ELECTRA. What, Melisander, are the grateful thanks That I can pay, to those thou shalt receive! The tongues of millions will unite to bless thee! A rescu'd people, with o'erflowing hearts, Shall on their festivals, in choral strains, Thy praises blend with those they give the Gods! Yes, good old man, thy zeal and stedfast truth, If the world's poor in bounties to reward, Heav'n, that approves and can, will amply pay. ORESTES. My dear Electra, to this more than brother, My Pylades, and to his gracious father, My life's protector, and my crown's ally, How vast our debt of kindness! PYLADES. Friendship claims, Illust'rous princess, 'mongst more dear regards, Some humble portion in the noble heart Of Agamemnon's heir. ELECTRA. 'Tis sure, Orestes, The cause must prosper that we see sustain'd By such associate virtues!âGen'rous prince! To own the call of royalty distrest, And risk thy safety to redress the wrong'd. SCENE THE FOURTH. ORESTES, ELECTRA, PYLADES, MELISANDER, ARCAS, ÃTHON and a train of Argian Nobles. ARCAS , kneeling with Ãthon and the argian nobles. See, sov'reign lord, your kingdom's richest store, The vow'd asserters of your sacred rights! A band of loyal and intrepid nobles, Who have resolv'd to hazard in your cause, All that they love, they honour, and they hope. ORESTES. Rise my good people [They all rise.ârather let me say, Friends, brothers, fathersâchildren!âO my soul! How strong are thy sensations! Language fails T' express the transports that I feel within meâ These silent oracles will best reveal them. PYLADES. Most happy meeting of a prince and people! ORESTES. Let Melisander, he who form'd my mind, Witness how oft my heart hath yearn'd to serve ye. Nor fear, my subjects, ye shall e'er lament My mad misuse of pow'r. The thrones of kings, I want not yet to learn, are only firm While fix'd on public use and approbation. Let tyrants strive with rods and racks to bow To forc'd obedience the reluctant will: Be it my glory, my delight, to merit That best of duty which affection prompts. ÃTHON. Such sentiments inspire our raptur'd souls With glowing gratitude and ardent zeal! Another monarch, like our Agamemnon, Comes, as a God, to scatter blessings round him! ARCAS. By the great name of him, whose sceptre sway'd The realms of Argos with renown and glory! Kneeling [They kneel. before his awful dust, we vow A firm allegiance to his lineal heir. Lead us to face your foesâto dangerâdeath! No soul shall shrink, no sword shall shame your cause. ORESTES. Rise not, my people, ere my willing knee Bend with the rest [Kneeling., and in the face of heav'n, By all its blest inhabitants, I swear Firmly to combat till I break your bonds, And fix, beyond the will of pow'r to shake, The full possession of your natal rights; Those rights which none but tyrants e'er invade. [They all rise. ELECTRA. The sacred ashes that are there enshrin'd, Must be a party in this solemn league. The injur'd have a right, the right of vengeance, Which heav'n admits whenever urg'd by justice. O then remember, my belov'd Orestes, Your murder'd sire. And you, who always found him The kind and common parent of ye all, Forget not, when your weapons shall assail The hearts whose flinty qualities could bear To act an outrage of so black a dye, To say ye strike for Agamemnon's wrongs. That sound shall make impiety recoilâ Thro' ev'ry nerve strike terror and dismayâ Add double venom to the shaft of death, And send them shudd'ring to the doom they merit. ORESTES , kneeling. Hear, slaughter'd parent, royal Agamemnonâ And ev'ry God recognize what I vow!â Ne'er shall this arm have respite, till my sword Has paid the debt of duty which it owes; And so reveng'd theeâthat thy awful ghost, Which now methinks, with languid looks, I see Point at its gorey wounds to fire my rage, Shall with a sigh of transport sayâ'tis done! And sink compos'd to everlasting rest. [He rises. ARCAS. Here break we off, lest interruption come, The harbinger of danger. What remains, Is to determine on the hour and place To manifest your person and design. The phocian bands, which royal Strophius sends For your support, draw near: ere they arrive It much imports our enterprize should open. MELISANDER. Goes not Ãgysthus with his num'rous guards To the wide plain without the city-gate This very hour, to solemnize the sports With which he entertains the populace, On the suppos'd disaster of their king? ÃTHON. He does. MELISANDER. The queenâgoes she not with him? ÃTHON. No. The tyrant, tho' reluctantly, consents, At her strong suit, to spare her soul the anguish A sight like that must give. MELISANDER. Th' occasion's good And we'll embrace it. Those who guard the palace Will be but few, and easily subdu'd. Possess'd thereof, we'll instantly proclaim Our just and loyal purpose. The whole people, Who venerate the house of Agamemnon, Will join to seize the city-gates, and bar The entrance of Ãgysthus, whose strong guard The hasten'd phocians sudden will surprize, Attack, and bravely vanquish. ORESTES. Well advis'd. May heav'n insure a happy execution. ARCAS. Princess, 'tis meet that you retire forthwithâ You need no caution for discreet demeanour. Expect us soon. Till when, by all safe means, Promote our good design. ELECTRA. Of that be sure. O my Orestes! that we now must part, Is to secure a long and happy meeting. SCENE THE FIFTH. ORESTES, PYLADES, MELISANDER, ARCAS, ÃTHON and Argian Nobles. MELISANDER. Princes, that all suspicion be prevented, Back to the palace speedily repair, And there let prudence regulate your conduct. Mean time, myself and all this band of nobles, Dispers'd throughout the city, will contrive With numbers to augment our loyal host. A moment stopânor want one due precaution. Remember that the place in which we meet Is Io's grove, which, on the western side, The Lycian forum skirts: from thence we'll issue, Full of our cause, to try the great eventâ Nor fear but we accomplish all we wish. SCENE THE SIXTH. ORESTES and PYLADES. ORESTES. Then does the hour, my Pylades, approach On which the fortunes of my life depend: That circles with a diadem this brow, Or, with my being, ends my ev'ry hope. PYLADES. Doubt not, my friend, the goodness of thy cause Of ev'ry God will make a champion for thee. While Iâbut whither would my frantic tongue? Downâdown inglorious passion, lest Orestes Disdain to hold me longer in his heart. ORESTES. What means my Pylades!âam I thy friend, And hast thou secrets thou would'st wish to smother? O give not rude suspicion room to whisper A want of confidence in him who loves thee. PYLADES. Then hear, and wonder! from the very moment In which I saw thy sister first, I felt Orestes had a rival in my heart. Caught by her tears for thy suppos'd disaster, I gaz'd 'till sympathy so baffled reason, I almost thought myself the tale was true. But when I heard her pious plea, to join Her father's vengeance with the gen'ral justice, Affection's glow of ardors forceful seiz'd And sunk my soul insensibly to bondage! All the big images of war and glory Shrunk from my mind, and a soft, stealing languor, A sick'ning apathy subdu'd my spirit. I fondly wish'd to wear my hours away, My head reclin'd upon her panting bosom; And, lost to all ambition, only live The happy object of Electra's love. ORESTES. Break from the force of such enfeebling thraldom, And, prince, assert your dignity of virtue. Remember you have vow'd with me to brave All toils and dangers to acquire renown. Remember we have mark'd a glorious scope For actions worthy our illustr'ous rank! And shall the roses of a dimpled cheek, The music of a sweetly-cadenc'd voice, Impede your progress to immortal fame? No, to mean souls be narrow schemes confin'd, A hero's aim should be to serve mankind: To wishing millions benefits impart, And thence to reign in ev'ry grateful heart. End of the THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Scene, an anti-chamber in the palace. ORESTES and PYLADES, meeting. ORESTES. My Pylades!âmost happily return'd. You went to mark the tyrant's progressâsay, How did my subjects seem affected with it? PYLADES. Sure never triumph wore so sad a face. As thro' the city, in imperial pomp, Ãgysthus rode, I mingled with the crowd, Observant in their eyes to read their hearts. The blaze of splendor was august and proud: But little satisfaction seem'd to give To those for whose delight it was display'd. The gay retinue of the pageant king Chaunted a solemn pÃ¦anâwhich the people Answer'd with deep-fetch'd sighs, and groans of anguish. Where-e'er I look'd, each bosom heav'd opprest, And ev'ry eye was dimn'd with mournful moisture. ORESTES. Blest be the omen!âev'ry eye be blest That dropt one tear in pity to Orestes. PYLADES. The wary tyrant with his guards gone forth, The city now is open to surprizeâ And I impatient for the glorious struggle Will lift thee to a throne. But, my Orestes, The part thou'st now to act will task thy pow'rs. I know thy nature gentle, therefore warn thee To arm thy heart with double resolution, Lest stealing pity for a guilty mother Should soften rigour, and defeat thy justice. ORESTES. A guilty mother!âMy belov'd companion, From out the palace-windows that command, In distant prospect, great Apollo's fane, Send an observing eye, and nicely mark The motions of our friends. I know not why, But my imagination's on the rackâ Go, my good Pylades, and bring me word What you observe is passing. PYLADES. I'll away. But must adjure thee, by thy thirst for glory, To rouze resentmentâharden indignationâ And arm thy soul to combat ev'ry horror. SCENE THE SECOND. ORESTES , solus. Horror indeed!âA mother!âif she's guilty, The Gods, and not a son, must punish her. For me to point my sword against the breast That gave me infant nourishmentâdire thought! It shakes my fiercestâfirmest purposes. I saw her sighâI saw ev'n tears steal from her, To hear the fabled story of my death. She could not weep without some touch of natureâ Which not to feelâwas not to be a woman. But what's the feeling of a heart that dar'd So dire an outrage on a husband's life? Fury re-kindles!âdetestation heaves!â And tumult and distraction fire my brain! Watch me, good Gods! in ev'ry start and transport! Arrest my arm if phrenzy should provoke, And save me from the guilt of matricide. Heav'ns!âshe is here!âI shudder to behold her. [He retires backwards. SCENE THE THIRD. ORESTES and CLYTEMNESTRA, musing. CLYTEMNESTRA. Vain is my search for peace, who bear about The cause that makes each place alike uneasy. O restless wretchedness of conscious guilt!â Sure what we feel's akin to what we fearâ And souls like mine anticipate damnation. How vain the pomps and glories that surround me! How insufficient to confer that bliss The virtuous beggar knows. His scraps are banquets, And his sleep elysiumâcompar'd with mine. My tasteless palate loaths the choicest viandsâ My bed's a nest of serpentsâand my mind The cave of terror, anguish and dismay! Spectres and goblins haunt the dreary scene! In fancy furies hissâfell demons howlâ And all is horrorâagonyâdespair!â Where-e'er I look, a husband's mangled form Rises before me!âand in ev'ry sound I hear his groans, his cries and exclamations! ORESTES , apart. She seems disorder'd! CLYTEMNESTRA. Heard I not a noise!â Who's there?âThe youth on whom my eyes could hang, I know not why, forever with delight. He wakes, whene'er I see him, the rememb'rance That I had once a sonâmy joyâmy pride! But prov'd a murd'ressânot a mother to him. ORESTES , advancing. I'll probe the woundâtho' hopeless of a cure. [Aside. CLYTEMNESTRA. Whence, gentle stranger, that thou'rt lonely here When public pastimes are proclaim'd? Delights So suited to a gay and youthful mind. ORESTES. Mine is but ill-dispos'd to relish pleasures. CLYTEMNESTRA. Can melancholy taint so young a heart? Or hast thou from misfortune found a cause To pine in pensive sadness? ORESTES. Oh!âA great one! The loss of a deserving, long-lov'd friend. CLYTEMNESRTA. Then thy affliction has a gen'rous plea. Yet as an evil that we know must come, The noble mind should be prepar'd to meet it; Nor suffer sorrow to usurp too highly For what's inevitable. ORESTES. Death, 'tis true, Is the condition life is granted onâ A debt that all must pay. The parent, lover, The friend and husband, know the hour will come Which must divide the best-cemented hearts. Yet, howe'er commonâtho' prepar'd and arm'd, A real loss will make the firmest feel. CLYTEMNESTRA. I know it wellâknow nature will have scopeâ And passion mock at reason's wisest precepts. ORESTES. We only, who remain behind, are loosers; For death's to many a relief from care, To none an evilâif not made by guilt. Yet where a bright assemblage of all virtues Blaze early forth, and meet a timeless blast, Like those which I lament, not only friends, But all mankind should sadden at the loss. CLYTEMNESTRA. Who was this wonder? ORESTES, The much-injur'd heir Of glorious Agamemnon! who had sworn, My soul assenting to the solemn vow, Never to rest, till to that hero's ghost He'd sacrific'd the spoiler of his life. CLYTEMNESTRA. Do'st thou not know meâthou presumptuous boy? ORESTES. Wellâand must teach you too, to know yourself. CLYTEMNESTRA. What would'st thou aim at?âTo assassinateâ ORESTES. No, by the Gods!âBut if thou art a woman, The strings of wife and mother I must strike, And jar them on thy heart. Thy royal lord, Leader of monarchs, vanquisher of Troy, The noblest warriour, and the first of kings, By thy devices, thy accomplice fell. CLYTEMNESTRA. Hah!â ORESTES. Are you stricken?âSeize the only means That can redeem your name from infamy, Your soul from endless torments. Earth and heav'n Demand the punishment of him who dar'd To violate all laws, divine and human, By an assault on majesty. Each God There lost a sacred representativeâ As ev'ry subject did a gracious father: But most your sonâyour unoffending sonâ Blood of your Bloodâ CLYTEMNESTRA. If life be worth thy careâ ORESTES. Down on thy kneesâand to the awful Gods Swear with the foe of regicides and traitors, To rend this pest of nature from the seat His guilt first gave him, and his crimes have stain'd, Or, by the vengeance of a murder'd husbandâ CLYTEMNESTRA. Unhand me, beardless ruffianânor presume Thus to profane my sex and dignity With such unlicenc'd outrageâor, this moment, The violation of all sacred rights Draws ruin irrevocable upon thee. ORESTES. Raise boist'rous passion to the height it reach'd When thou decreed'st a king and husband's slaughter! Summon the furies, give the damn'd beneath An hour of horrid joy! Bid the winds roar, The mountain-billows clash, the earth be shook, And set the skies on fire!âAmid'st their wreck, Did'st thou, a dreadful deity, preside, I'd fearless face thee to arraign such crimes! Urge the loud cry of men and Gods for justiceâ Compel the strokeâor punish the refusal. CLYTEMNESTRA. To men and Godsâto thee and Agamemnonâ Orestesâall, I dare avow the deedâ Exult and glory in it!âWould again, Tho' the red bolt were hissing in the hand Of heav'ns almighty thund'rer, bravely strike For happy freedom from the man who wrong'd me. ORESTES. The complicated vengeance will have way, And thus o'erwhelms thee [going to kill her, but stops.âEverlasting Gods!â Whither was phrenzy goading desperation?â Gape hell, and save me from a crime so horrid. [falls on his face. CLYTEMNESTRA. But, to thy ruin, indignation prompts A surer aimâ [snatching up the sword, and going to kill him. SCENE THE FOURTH. ORESTES, CLYTEMNESTRA and ELECTRA. ELECTRA , seizing Clytemnestra's arm. Assist to save him, heav'n! Inhuman mother!âRiseâO rise, Orestes, While I have strength to struggle with her fury. CLYTEMNESTRA. Hah!â ORESTES , after having raised himself so as to rest on one hand. Hath amazement seiz'd thee?âFrom thy hand The dreadful instrument of death is fall'n!â Why do'st thou gaze and tremble?âHas the name Of an abandon'd son such magic pow'r, That it disarms thy rage?âTake up again The deadly weaponâsee, my bosom's bar'dâ Plunge it resolv'd, and finish ev'ry fear. CLYTEMNESTRA. Art thou Orestes?âHide me friendly earthâ Cover me with my guiltâmy shameâmy terror! ORESTES , rising. I am Orestesâam th' unhappy son You doom'd, a helpless infant, to destruction, And forc'd from sov'reignty to seek relief, A miserable beggar, thro' the world. But the great Gods, whose wonder-working justice No human wiles can circumvent, ordain That here I stand their awful delegate, To wrest my sceptre from unhallow'd hands, And punish treason, cruelty and murder. Let rapine, then, and persecution tremble. The scene of guilty greatness closes hereâ And all in view is horror and despair. CLYTEMNESTRA. Despair and horror have been long familiar, The inmates and companions of my heart. Nor know I wish, or will, or hope, or refugeâ Then what I merit let me learn to welcome. [turns aside, and weeps. ELECTRA , apart to Orestes. What hast thou done?âWhat dangers madly tempted? ORESTES , apart to Electra. I was to blame. But an unguarded minute Gave reason's throne to rage. ELECTRA , apart to Orestes. 'Twas fatal rashness To hazard so thy safety. CLYTEMNESTRA. Conscience thus Abashes the debas'dâI fear to look On those whom I have wrong'd. The indignation Which pride discharg'd, recoils with wounding shameâ O matchless tortureâmiseryâmy child! ORESTES. Nay, if you weep you soften me to womanâ I am not proof 'gainst tears. CLYTEMNESTRA , kneeling and they with her. Behold, my son, To what a mother's conscious guilt subjects her! I bend me at thy feetâand bless the Gods For the protection which their pow'r vouchsaf'd thee, I fear'd myself thy murd'ressâand my soul Had load enough before to weigh it down, Nor needed the accumulative curse Of such an apprehension. ORESTES. Are those tears The genuine tribute of sincere contrition? Hast thou parental feelings still! CLYTEMNESTRA. Indeed I ne'er was harden'd quite into a monsterâ Nature adher'd, tho' heav'n had cast me offâ While conscience with her iron hand wrung drops Of blood and water from my heart and eyes. ELECTRA. God's! have I liv'd to mingle melting tears In such a scene! ORESTES. Had sorrow and distress Rent ev'ry fibre of our bleeding bosoms, So innocence had been our comforter, This fellowship in anguish had been bliss To what we feel. CLYTEMNESTRA. How I have wish'd and pray'd, Heav'n's host can witnessâwithout ceasing pray'd For their support and comfort to thee. ORESTES. Rise, [they all rise. And re-compose thy ruffled spirits. CLYTEMNESTRA. Longâ Too long, by pride, perversenessâfolly led, I doubled torture to conceal my shame, Masking affliction with a face of smilesâ While in my mind existed such a hell As only fiends experience. SCENE THE FIFTH. ORESTES, CLYTEMNESTRA, ELECTRA and PYLADES, with his sword drawn. PYLADES. Arm, my friend, We are betray'dâthe city is all strifeâ Slaughter and tumult rage in ev'ry street! Hither contending parties seem to bend Their furious courseâdelay notâfollow me. SCENE THE SIXTH ORESTES, CLYTEMNESTRA and ELECTRA. ELECTRA. O my distracting fears!âmy brotherâ ORESTES. Gods! Comes disappointment at my fortune's crisis? ELECTRA. Nay, do not lingerâ ORESTES. Will notâ CLYTEMNESTRA. Go, my children, And be the Gods your guides to sure escape. ORESTES. Will you not with us seek one common safety? CLYTEMNESTRA. Preserve yourselvesâmy fortune cannot wrong meâ Nor will I hazard or impede your flight. ORESTES. Electraâ ELECTRA. Sayâ ORESTES. You must not stay behind. ELECTRA. I will not. ORESTES. Follow near meâ ELECTRA. Onâlead on. SCENE THE SEVENTH. CLYTEMNESTRA. sola. Whither shall Iâbut 'tis no matter whitherâ My torments cling too close to be shook offâ And for the restâ'tis all beneath regard. [Shouting behind. Hark!âWhence that clam'rous joy!âSome dire mishap Befalls my children!âIn my bosom sheathe Your sacrilegious swords, ye sons of slaughter, But spare the wrong'dâO spare the innocent. SCENE THE EIGHTH. Scene, an open place within the city. MELISANDER, ÃTHON and Nobles. ÃTHON. Confusion! They have gain'd the palace. MELISANDER. Then The prince and all our hopes together perish. ÃTHON. 'Tis desperationâbut we will advance And force our wayâor resolutely fall. SCENE THE NINTH. MELISANDER, ÃTHON, Nobles and ARCAS. ARCAS. Lost and undone!âOur numbers, over-match'd, Shrink back, appall'd!âthe princes cannot join us. MELISANDER. Great Gods!âhow curst a treachery! ÃTHON. Behold The royal Pylades! SCENE THE TENTH. MELISANDER, ÃTHON, ARCAS, Nobles and PYLADES. ARCAS. O welcome, princeâ PYLADES. On ev'ry side confusion gathers round us! Our ranks are brokenâall is dire dismay! MELISANDER. Where did you leave Orestes? PYLADES. At th' alarm I bade him followâsure he loiter'd not, For staying but a moment was perdition. I hardly scap'd the foremost foes, who prest To join the palace-guards for its defence. MELISANDER. Then fear informs me he's forever lost! ÃTHON. 'Tis but our risking lifeâ ARCAS. 'Twill be in vain: They are so strong in numbers, we shall rush On fruitless slaughter. Let us hope, my brothers, That he has joined some party of our friends. ÃTHON. See! they press on us! MELISANDER. 'Tis no place of safety. Nor can we dallyâfor the God of day Is near his western goal.âSound a retreat. [A retreat founded behind. SCENE THE ELEVENTH. Scene, an anti-chamber in the palace. ÃGYSTHUS, CLYTEMNESTRA and Attendants. ÃGYSTHUS. The treason was refin'd!âThey'd deeply laid Their hellish plotâan hour, a minute more Had lost my kingdom.â'Twas my faithful Lycon, Whose ardent zeal is ever on the watch, That gain'd me timely notice.âClytemnestra! What means that downcast and averted look? By all my glorious hopes, thou art in league With damn'd conspirators against my life. CLYTEMNESTRA. What can I answer?âWords and vows are fruitless, Where rude suspicion takes from innocence Its pure and native whiteness. Hast thou foes Who are not such to me? Or guilt to answer Of which my soul is clear?âWhat wonder then, In scenes like this, if apprehension fills My heart with horror, and my eyes with tears. SCENE THE TWELFTH. To them LYCON, with ORESTES and ELECTRA, guarded. ÃGYSTHUS , embracing LYCON. My crown and life's preserver!âWelcome, Lyconâ What tidings of the rebels? LYCON. In confusion, They have retreated to the sacred grove? A hold so strong, that all attempts to force it, Till farther aids are gather'd, might prove fatal. Pardon the trespass, if their active zeal Has been too forward, but my soldiers seiz'd The princess with this youth, as they attempted Escaping from the palace to the foe. ÃGYSTHUS. Secure 'em bothâby heav'n they both shall rue it. That beardless stripling with his life shall pay The price of so abhor'd and foul a treason. And for yon viper, whose invenom'd teeth, Would tear my vitals, on her head shall drive The storm directed with such rage at mine. 'Twill joy me to behold her writhing pangsâ Her groans will sound like music's sweetest notes, Her tears be dropping balm to my repose. Drag 'em away. ELECTRA. I'll not sollicit mercy: For could I stoop to ask it, well I know, From knowing thee, that I should ask in vain. The debt of piety I owe a fatherâ A murder'd fatherâand the dear regard An injur'd brother claims, would move compassion Ev'n in a foe who had humanity, Did I acknowledge all that you suspect. But I'm before a judge whose heart is iron; And whose invet'racy would turn the test Of spotless innocence against itself. Be rancour then indulg'd. Sate your revenge With all the tortures cruelty can frameâ I'll strive to meet them with such fortitude As courage gives, and dignity demands. But since my blood must stream, let mine suffice. This hapless youth, unfriended and unknown, Whom I persuaded to assist my flight, Deserves no share of punishment. ORESTES. Hear me, Since I it was who counsell'd her to go. 'Twas I was privy to the plot against you, And first appriz'd her of it. She was drawn By fond affection for a long-lost brother, But to behold him. As a helpless woman, She could not injureâcould not wield a sword, As I had sworn to do, against your crown. ELECTRA. His aim is to deceive youâ ORESTES. Heed her notâ ELECTRA. Alas! he raves! ORESTES. No I am calm, and fearlessâ Disdaining safety from a woman's peril. ÃGYSTHUS. By my best wishes, this distracted struggle Starts a surmise that's worthy my pursuing. Such wonderful regardâsuch flaming zeal Of each to save the other makes it plainâ He can beâis, no other than Orestes. ORESTES. Suspicion will suggest the means for proofâ Nor shall my honour take the stain of falsehoodâ Then know me for the rightful monarch here. I will not stoop from royalty so low As to sollicit, or accept your favour: But to th' unerring justice of the Gods Submit my lotâlet them determine it. ÃGYSTHUS. A mind so haughty in a state so abject, Fails of its end, not kindling admiration. An impotence of pride's ally'd to folly, And, as it merits, ever meets derision. But your heroic spirits shall be try'd. Alike your vaunted fortitude exert, For both shall suffer. CLYTEMNESTRA. Can I tamely stand, And see my children doom'd to death before me! Noâagonizing nature prompts the plea Which sure would soften ev'n offended Gods! O my Ãgysthus! if you ever lov'd [kneeling. Your Clytemnestra, spare her panting bowels, And wade no farther on in guiltless blood. [While Clytemnestra is speaking, Ãgysthus talks with Lycon. My soul's already on distraction's verge! Ah! timely stop the arm of violenceâ For so much slaughter have my eyes beheld, That more must make me mad. ÃGYSTHUS , apart to LYCON. 'Tis wisely urg'dâ Their deaths would worse inflame the factious spirits. LYCON , apart to ÃGYSTHUS. And should the fortune of your arms give way, Their persons may secure your terms. ÃGYSTHUS , apart to LYCON. 'Tis true, And well advis'd. They shall not suffer nowâ We'll weigh this matter farther. CLYTEMNESTRA. Turn, in pity, And see these streaming eyesâ ÃGYSTHUS. Detested sight! Be dumb upon this themeâor, by the Gods! You share the doom you never shall revoke. CLYTEMNESTRA , Rising. Be those just Gods as deaf to your petition In life's last fearful moments. ÃGYSTHUS. Say'st thou!âTraitress. Hence, from my sight. CLYTEMNESTRA. Would I had been so ever. ÃGYSTHUS. Seize her, and force her instantly away. CLYTEMNESTRA. Inhuman tyrant!âoffâstand offâI'm calmâ And, tho' insulted, know me for a queen. My anguish swells too high for tears or wordsâ Thou can'st not frown me deadâI wish thou could'stâ Then might I find an end of guilt and sorrow. O heart too hard for wrongs or griefs to breakâ When will thy suff'rings cease?âDistressful sight!â The innocent and injur'd weep at woes Too justly merited by wrongs to them. Celestial pow'rs!âprotect my helpless childrenâ They've now no hope of succour but from you. SCENE THE THIRTEENTH. ÃGYSTHUS, LYCON, ORESTES, ELECTRA and Guards. ÃGYSTHUS. Take hence these boasters, and in sep'rate dungeons See them secur'd from converse and from light. ELECTRA. A lot I've long been exercis'd for bearing. ORESTES. I was prepar'd, Electra, to die with thee: But not to live divided. ELECTRA. Fear not life. We shall not long lament each other's absence. I know the Ruler of our fates too well To dread that cruel kindness. ORESTES. Then we partâ ELECTRA. Forever! ORESTES. Killing thought! ELECTRA. Nay do not weep. ORESTES. Ne'er 'till this moment did I taste affliction: For ev'ry ill I've hitherto encounter'd Was happiness, compar'd with what I feel In this heart-rendingâO malicious fortune!â Could ruin reach me not without involving Innocence like thine? A planet so malignant Rul'd at my hour of birth, that I am destin'd To murder all who love me. ELECTRA. Do not grudge The satisfaction that my heart receives In dying with theeâfor theeâ ÃGYSTHUS. Force 'em hence. ORESTES. Fell ministersâindulge me an embraceâ I ask no more. Electra!âto thy fate I am constrain'd to yield thee up. ELECTRA. This pang, Tho' not the last, will be by far the sharpest Our issuing souls can sufferâ ORESTES. Oh!âFarewel. Orestes goes off, guarded; and after him, Electra. SCENE THE FOURTEENTH. ÃGYSTHUS and LYCON. ÃGYSTHUS. Fortune befriends me still!âI liveâI triumph! While treason grovels in the chains she forg'd Wherewith to shackle majesty.âMy Lycon, Be thine the disposition of our host. While night her dark dominion shall maintain, With caution guard the palace from surprize. We'll think, ere PhÅbus mounts his radient seat, Of means to make our victory complete. End of the FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Scene, an anti-chamber in the palace. ÃGYSTHUS and LYCON, meeting. LYCON. Health to the majesty of Argos. ÃGYSTHUS. Lycon! I joy to meet thee. My impatient heart Has panted for intelligence. The rebelsâ LYCON. Are still entrench'd within the groveâand seemâ ÃGYSTHUS. What! will they brave me?âWith the strength I have I'll force them thence, orâ LYCON. Think upon the danger Of so precipitate an enterprize. I fear too many of your subjects souls Abet their trait'rous purpose. To attack 'em, And to miscarry, will encourage others Boldly to hurl defiance at your throne. You must be circumspectâand yet delay Will wear a face of fearâwhat to adviseâ O for the inspiration of some God! ÃGYSTHUS. For that, my Lycon, all this tedious night My soul has suffer'd on a rack of thought. Ten thousand apprehensions crowding came, And strew'd with thorns my pillowânor approach'd The God of slumber, with his lenient touch To seal my aching eye-lids, and relieve My heart one moment from its galling load. Successive schemes my wearying mind revolv'dâ But ineffectual all. Nor had the lark Her early mattin chaunted to the morn, Ere I aroseâunrestedâunresolv'd. And yet what courseâone means we must applyâ And that has difficulties tooâ'tisâ LYCON. Death!â I have consider'd, and the prince must die. ÃGYSTHUS. How readily thy genius runs with mineâ Friend to my purpose.âBut, my faithful Lycon, How can the precious bus'ness be perform'd? A public execution might prove fatalâ Yet with concealment 'twill not reach our end. The mad'ning croud, to blast rebellion's growth, And root up ranc'rous hopeâmust know 'tis done. On thee, good Lycon, shall I not rely To do th' important service?âtell meâ LYCON. Yesâ Orestes falls your victim. ÃGYSTHUS. And Electra. LYCON. There must my heart turn rebel and resist. ÃGYSTHUS. Nay stop not, half-way down, my stooping vengeance! The quarry my impatient soul would seize Is full security. And can I boast, While that incendiary lives, an hour of safety? Thou know'st I cannot. Therefore, if thou lov'st me, Strike with a resolution nobly firm, And rid my breast at once of ev'ry fear. LYCON. A lover's feelingsâ ÃGYSTHUS. Say'st thou?âFoolish Lycon! See'st thou a spark for hope to kindle from? Does she not scornâreject?âAnd art thou yet So lost to all conviction, as to doubt If marble may not with more ease be bent Than can her stubborn and unpliant will. Then rouse a manly and becoming spirit. Let fond desire ferment to furious rage; Spurn her vile scorn, and trample on her prideâ ForceâravishâI resign her to thy wishâ So in return, when thou hast sated thine, Thy master's passion be appeas'd with blood. LYCON. Tremendous impulse!â ÃGYSTHUS. Wilt thou?â LYCON. 'Tis decreedâ She falls at once the victim of my love And your revenge. Propose the lucky means, And all shall be accomplish'd. ÃGYSTHUS. Take this keyâ It masters ev'ry lockâand gives thee passport Safe, by the secret passage, to their cells. Firm well thy heart against her tears and pleadings With this rememb'ranceâhalf MycenÃ¦'s wealth And my unbounded favour crown the deed. Then let not frailty wrong thy int'restâ LYCON. Noâ Though in the way I met my father's ghost, His brow contracted, and his awful form Sternly oppos'd, and threat'ning! by his side, The shade of my much-honour'd mother kneeling, With supplicating looksâand out-stretch'd arms, Stopping the scanty avenue before meâ On I would go. Should ev'n the yawning earth Gape and discover all the damn'd in torture, I'd not shrink back. Then banish ev'ry doubt: For by the hopes with which you glad my heart, They both shall perish. ÃGYSTHUS. Dearâdeserving Lycon! Let me embrace theeâbe resolv'dâbe happy. SCENE THE SECOND. ÃGYSTHUS , solus. Then I am victor!âThen I reign secure. Treason shall with her hated objects die, And my ambition and revenge alike Be fully crown'd.âHah! Clytemnestra here! SCENE THE THIRD. ÃGYSTHUS and CLYTEMNESTRA. CLYTEMNESTRA. Tell me, Ãgysthus, for my boding heart Flutters and fears, as does the parent-bird When danger threatens her defenceless youngâ Where are my children? I'm not lost enough To nature, not so much a savage yet, And harden'd in my guilt, to bear the thought Of treas'ring woes and multiplying crimes, By endless wrongs and never-ceasing murders. ÃGYSTHUS. After advancing hand in hand so far In blood and desolation, would'st thou stop, And risk a reck'ning for our whole account, Thro' squeamish terror at one added stroke? Noâwe have gone too far for a retreat, And must proceed. The woman who once dar'd To plot a husband's death, might spare to plead In the behalf of her rebellious offspring. CLYTEMNESTRA. All-seeing Gods!âAnd dar'st thou, vile deluder, Accuse me falsely of that damning deed? The wicked act was thine. In me I feel 'Twas guilt enoughâtoo much, that I was privyâ Prevented notâor pardon'd it when done. ÃGYSTHUS. Whose-e'er the crime, we shar'd in happier fruits As now in dangers from it. Therefore think What mischiefs menace in thy rash request. Our happiness, our beingsâcrownsâ CLYTEMNESTRA. No matterâ Let us resign them allâsubmit to beg, A miserable pair, about the worldâ To hazard perilsâwelcome ev'ry ill, Want, shame, affliction, punishmentâev'n death! Rather than hold our scepters and our lives By braving earth and heav'n with endless outrage. ÃGYSTHUS. Far be it from me to prescribe your choice, But mine's to guard the blessings I possess, Nor shall your rashness put 'em to the hazard. In what's my life less precious than your childrens? If one must perish, the great law of nature Directs th' election. This for myself. If you Can plead a duty of superiour force To what you owe a husbandâ CLYTEMNESTRA. That of justiceâ The first of those commanded by the Gods! Yes, justice clamours 'gainst the horrid guilt Of butch'ring innocents to wear their spoils. But if, with ruin of your soul and peace, This idol of a crown must be preserv'd, Oh! give me up my childrenâand I'll lead 'em To rocks and deserts, where, 'mongst prouling tribes, Some hospitable cave shall yield us shelterâ And there I'll hide 'emâthere devote my days To sorrow and repentance, till I've gain'd Forgiveness for the wrongs I've done. ÃGYSTHUS. Forgiveness? Forever blasted be the tongue that asks it. Damnation! Is thy spirit so debas'd, So sunk from glorious hopeâdivine ambition? How I detest thee!âHence to howling wilds, Thy abject wish, and hide thyself forever, SCENE THE FOURTH. CLYTEMNESTRA , sola. Barbarian, stay.âHe's goneâhe's gone to doom 'em! To bathe his ruthless hands in orphan-blood And rend the entrails of a wife!âGreat Gods! Arrest the fell assassin's impious arm, And turn his dagger on the heart that's guilty. [Distant shouting behind. Hah!âwhence that shout!âmy trembling soul alarm'd, Now shrinks at each intruding apprehension! [Shouting again. Another!âand approaching!âlet 'em comeâ Let gath'ring mischiefs cluster, and involve The injur'rs with the injur'd.âPow'rs of mercy!â However justice deals with such as meâ Oh! interpose and succourâsave my children. SCENE THE FIFTH. Scene, a dark prison. ORESTES , solus, lying at his length. What more than midnight darkness!âthe keen air, Sharpen'd with noisome vapours that transpire From the moist pavement and the clammy walls, Chills, as it runs, the current of my blood. Here I can give a scope to mournful musingsâ Can to distraction ruminateâand curse, If cursing would availâmy wayward fortune. [Rises. Where are the golden hopes that yester sun Saw tow'ring to the skies?âMy flatt'ring dreams Of royalty regain'dâand great revenge? All are a grasp of airâa gather'd beam From heav'n's resplendent orb!âwhat I amânothing. Hark!âheard I not a noise?âSurely the voice Of soft-complaining sorrow!â'Tis Electra'sâ Unhappy sister!â[Shrieking behind. Ah! that melting cry!â The ministers of fate are there at work! Why, blood-hounds, would ye not begin with me, And spare my soul this anguish? [Shrieking again.âWhat, another!â O agonizing sound!âAnd where's the aid, In this distress, a brother should afford? O for a more than mortal force, to break These iron-bolted doors and marble walls, That I might rush, and rescue her from slaughter. Hark!âall is hush'dâthe dreadful work's perform'd! The lamb of innocence is sacrific'd To hell-born tyranny and black revenge. But seeâan op'ning doorâa taper's blazeâ The dawn of death is breaking in upon me! Advance fell instrumentsâimmortal Gods!â My sister!âmy Electra!â SCENE THE SIXTH. ORESTES, and ELECTRA, with a lighted torch one hand and a drawn sword in the other. ELECTRA. Take this swordâ [He takes the sword and torch. And seize the happy minute for escape. ORESTES. Amazement!âWhence this providential turn? Thy dress is all disorder'd! and thy face Full of affright and horror!âWhat has happen'd? ELECTRA. I want the breath to give it utt'rance.âLyconâ With ruffian violence, assail'd my honour. At first with soothing vows he sought to conquerâ Till finding they were fruitlessâhe then menac'd. But impotent alike in that attemptâ His last essay was force!âI trembledâshriek'dâ And call'd on all the host of heav'n to aid me! Till in the struggleâsure some pitying God Inspir'd the thoughtâI sudden drew his sword, And plung'd it thro' his heart. He backward sprung Upon the pavement!âroll'd his ghastly eyesâ Blasphem'd, and curstâ'till, with a dreadful roar Of mingled rage and pain, his furious soul Broke from the quiv'ring flesh! ORESTES. All gracious pow'rs! The work was yours. ELECTRA. I seiz'd that friendly torch, And found the key that gave him ent'rance. Soon I try'd it on your cellâfor I remark'd Where they dispos'd you when they brought us hitherâ And found, transported, 'twas a passport to you. O, my Orestes, how I bless the Gods, That I once more am made their instrument To save your precious life. But haste we hence, And thro' yon vaulted mazesâdreary scenesâ Trace out our path to safety. [A confused noise behind. ORESTES. Hah!âWhat noise? ELECTRA. O my distracting fears! Some new arrest! Ruin pursues us on too sure a scent. ORESTES. The sounds increase! Whatever the event, We cannot shun it. ELECTRA. Grudging destiny! Was all you could afford this short-liv'd hope? Alas, my brother, what my arm has done Will nothing stead thee now. Howe'er, at least The mournful satisfaction it secures, That we shall die together. ORESTES. Here I'll stand To intercept all danger on its wayâ And guard, while I have pow'r to wield a sword, My dear Electra's life. ELECTRA. See! they approach! Hear you their clashing weapons? ORESTES. Keep behind me. How fearful are the gleams of flashing light, Which from their tapers, thro' the bending arches, Stream onward broken glares! ELECTRA. Nowânow they come! ORESTES. Pray be compos'd. Your terrors more depress A heart that bleedsâastonishment!âmy friend? SCENE THE SEVENTH. ORESTES, ELECTRA, PYLADES and Attendants, with lights. PYLADES. O my Orestes!âdo my arms entwine thee!â [Embracing him. Electra too!âThis, this indeed is transportâ [Embracing her. Pardon the rude expression of my joy! ORESTES. Say, Pylades, what miracle redeems us? What blest event? For such, my gallant friend, Thy eyes discover, ere thy tongue relates it. PYLADES. A miracle indeedâand worthy heav'n! Your arms prevailâyour diadem is wonâ Your enemy in chainsâ ORESTES. Benignant Gods! ELECTRA. Proceed. PYLADES. When, yester-night, we found Ãgysthus Was master of your persons, ev'ry mind Was fill'd with terrorârous'd to desperationâ Fearing the spirit of the ruthless tyrant Would sate its baneful rancour with your blood, And frust'rate all our glorious hopes forever. But still resolv'd to rescue or revenge ye, Sage Melisander urg'd my secret posting With speed to hasten on our phocian succours. Eager I fledâand by the guiding light Of golden phosphor led 'em with successâ Aurora saw us at MycenÃ¦'s gatesâ Which having forc'd, we join'd our joyful friends. Soon as with brandish'd arms and clam'rous shouts Our firm, united bands began to move, The torrent of allegiance turn'd its course, And pour'd in tides the people to our aid. The palace almost instantly surroundedâ We quickly master'd the usurper's guards, And seiz'd his personâwhere in chains he waits The doom your sov'reign justice shall decree. ORESTES. Transporting tidings!âHaste we to the spotâ My soul's on fire 'till I've accomplish'd all. SCENE THE EIGHTH. Scene, an interior court of the palace. ÃTHON, Nobles and Officers. ÃTHON. Place trusty centinels at ev'ry door, And send out parties to patrole the streets, That peace and order may resume their sway. SCENE THE NINTH. ÃTHON, Nobles and MELISANDER. [Shouting heard from behind. ÃTHON. Whence, Melisader, that tumultuous noise? MELISANDER. The loyal transports of the populace, On being told Orestes is in safety. ÃTHON. Are all the tyrant's instruments of mischief, His guards and mercenary creatures seiz'd? MELISANDER. All are secur'd. The government and city Are in our hands. So total a revolt Was wonderful!âand worthy of the people O'er whom immortal Agamemnon reign'd. [Shrieking heard from behind. ÃTHON. Heard you those shrieks?â MELISANDER. Almighty pow'rs! defend us From aught, in such an hour, to mar our triumph. ÃTHON. They seem'd to issue from the state-apartments! MELISANDER. On minds like ours, from perils scarce recover'd, The least alarm strikes terror!âThis, tho' void Of grounds for apprehension, makes me tremble. ÃTHON. Arcas descends the palace-stairs in hasteâ By all the Gods, his visage wears dismay! SCENE THE TENTH. ÃTHON, MELISANDER, Nobles and ARCAS. MELISANDER. Some dire disaster!âMy much honour'd friend, Ease our impatient hearts, and instant say, From whence, and why, those piercing sounds of horror? ARCAS. Unhappy accident!âThe minute past, Orestes rushing with impetuous rage To execute his vengeance on Ãgysthus, The queen, his mother, interposing, met The fury of his arm, and in her breast Receiv'd the wound intended for her lord. She bleeds to death!âwhile her distracted offspring Dissolve in melting agonies. MELISANDER. Great Gods! Inspire our friendship to relieve their woes. SCENE THE ELEVENTH. Scene, a magnificent apartment. CLYTEMNESTRA is discovered wounded and bleeding in a chair. On one side of her, Ãgysthus in chains, guarded. On the other, Electra, fainting in the arms of her Attendants. Forwarder on the stage stands Orestes, leaning on the bosom of Pylades, his naked sword lying bloody before him. ORESTES. Speak not of comfort to meâthere's a sight Must banish it forever from my mind. PYLADES. What shall I say to soften sorrow? ORESTES. Nothing. Oh! I'm a finish'd wretch!ânor hope, nor peace Can more be mine. Henceforth must ev'ry man, And ev'ry God, abhor me for this deed. SCENE THE TWELFTH. ORESTES, PYLADES, ÃGYSTHUS, CLYTEMNESTRA, ELECTRA, MELISANDER, ARCAS, ÃTHON, Nobles, Attendants and Guards. MELISANDER. My royal lordâ ORESTES. Too faithful, Melisander, Behold in what thy gen'rous labours end! Thy care has been to nurse a parricide! Pour forth thy execrationsâand the world Will join in cursing the detested hand That shed a mother's blood. CLYTEMNESTRA. Forbear, my son, Nor more accuse thyself. The righteous Gods Decreed that thou, whom I so much have wrong'd, Should'st punish my transgressions. In my fall, I trace the justice of offended heav'n, And hold thee blameless. Let my dying voice, Experienc'd long in guilt and its effects, Warn thee, my child, to persevere in virtue; For happiness is vainly hop'd without it. When innocence is gone, th' unstable mind Floats, like a wreck upon the boist'rous waves, The sport and prey of each unruly passionâ Till at life's closeâthe judgement seat in viewâ How shall I face a murd'red husband there! O think, offenders, on this awful minuteâ For 'twill o'ertake ye allâand ev'ry one Must tremble and despairâlikeâoh! [Dies. ORESTES. Electra!â ELECTRA. I would speak comfortâbut my falt'ring tongueâ ORESTES. I now am past it.âWhy d'ye look so gentle? Why is not ev'ry arm uprear'd against me? Is there no manâno God, will interpose, And temper mercy with becoming justice? Will all combine to spareâA light'ning's blast! A fire consumesâa whirlwind tears my brain! PYLADES. Alas, he raves!âDistemper'd reason dies. ORESTES. All's hush'd!âThe raven now forbears to croak Her hollow notesâforeboding desolation! The matricide may pause!âOne fearful minute Th' infernal sisters yieldâAh! now they yell! They grind their teeth!âthey lash me!âOh! my torture! ARCAS. Helpâhold himâ ÃTHON. Melting object! ORESTE. Wer't not thou A damn'd accomplice with me?âCome, and take Thy portion from the scourge of stern Alecto. Her serpents hiss!âOh! from my bosom rend This fierce promethean eagle, whose fell beak So mangles my poor heart. [Sinking into the arms of the attendants. MELISANDER. Bear hence the king. And, pious princess, let your care assist To comfort and relieve his wounded mind. ELECTRA. Be ev'ry God propitious to the task. SCENE THE THIRTEENTH. ÃGYSTHUS, MELISANDER, ARCAS, ÃTHON, Nobles, Attendants and Guards, with the dead body of CLYTEMNESTRA. MELISANDER. Take hence that tyrant to the fate he merits. On the same spot where Agamemnon bled Let him be executed. Then cast forth His carcass, for a prey to dogs and vultures. ÃGYSTHUS. My soul, superiour to your pow'r and malice, Disdains such puny vengeance. Be my fate Whate'er it may, ye shall not see me shrink, But face it with a kingly resolution. Gods if there are, I never sought to please 'em. So whatsoever may hereafter proveâ Why that I'll welcome too. But for mankind, Who saw unmov'd the suff'rings of our race, I've ever hatedâever sought to plagueâ Shewn them no mercyâand I ask for noneâ But, as a dying legacy, bequeath To all, this wish.âMay frauds, contentions, rapines, Flames, famines, pestilencesâslaughters rage! And fill, if possible, the world with torments Greater than those which I'm prepar'd to suffer. SCENE THE LAST. MELISANDER, ARCAS, ÃTHON, Nobles and Attendants, with the dead body of CLYTEMNESTRA. MELISANDER. Tremendous proof how far habitual crimes Can harden human minds! But the just Gods, Who partial evils turn to gen'ral good, From such examples signify to man, That peace by wickedness is surely marr'd, And guilt will ever find its fit reward.
