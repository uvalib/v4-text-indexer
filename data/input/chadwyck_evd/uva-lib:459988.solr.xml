      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Calypso, a Goddess inhabiting the Island Ogygia. Signiora Margarita. Eucharis, the Chief of her Nymphs, Signiora Manina Telemachus, a young Grecian Prince, the Son of Ulysses. Mrs. Barbier. Mentor, attending Telemachus as his Friend, and known to him only under that Quality, but is Minerva conceal'd in the Person of Mentor. Mrs. Pearson. Proteus, a Sea-God, the Son of Neptune and Tethys; represented by the Poets, as having a Power to transform himself into all manner of Shapes. Mr. Leveridge. Nymphs attending Calypso.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, The Island Ogygia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Sea-Shore. Calypso, Eucharis. Calypso looking towards the Sea. Cal. Here, on this Beach he stood, the Pride of Greece, 'Twas here from my forsaken Isle The fam'd Ulysses parted. Nor cou'd eternal Spring that blossoms here, The Promise of Immortal Youth, Nor all my soothing ArtsâAh cruel Hero! Engage thy Stay. I saw thee climb the Ship, I saw thee sail, Till far in trackless Seas I lost the Sight, Then turn'd away my Eyes, which since Have serv'd me but to weep thy Absence. For thee the rilling Waters weep, That dash from Rocks, or softly creep In Murmurs to the Sea. The Winds that o'er my Island blow, Bear on their breezy Wings my Woe, And sighing call for thee. For thee the rilling Waters weep, That dash from Rocks, or softly creep In Murmurs to the Sea. Euch. Behold, divine Calypso, Two gallant Strangers from the Shore Are this way moving At yonder Creek I saw them first appear. Cal. The Seas run highâ'Twas such a Day as this When first I saw Ulysses. Alas! unknowing I pronounce that Name, Still the fond Sound dwells flatt'ring on my Tongue; Ulysses! O Ulysses! Euch. See, here they come. Cal. Eucharis, Withdraw with me, and let us mark them. [They retire to a Corner of the Stage. SCENE II. Telemachus and Mentor enter at a Distance. Calypso, Eucharis, Telemachus, Mentor. Tel. Ye gracious Gods! To what new Trial have you hither brought me? I goâyet know not where, Fate leads, and I obey. The Brave still free from Fear, Pursue their destin'd Way. I goâyet know not where, Fate leads, and I obey. Cal. aside.] 'Tis he, the lovely Youth, Ulysses Son! His Father lives exprest in every Feature. 'TisâO my conscious beating Heart!â 'Tis he, it is Telemachus. [Advances to them as they are going off. Young Stranger, stay! The Land you tread is mine; How have you dar'd t'approach it without Leave? Tel. O Nymph Divine! for such thy Form bespeaks thee, A sudden Shipwreck cast me on your Isle, Pity th'unhappy Son of Great Ulysses, That wand'ring seeks his Father; My Father wand'ring too o'er Seas and Land Has spent whole Years; Since from Troy's famous Siege returning home, By Fates averse detain'd, He strives, in vain, to reach his native Shore, That seems to fly before him. Cal. aside.] O he is all Ulysses!âBut that Friend! Who is he, or from whence? Severest Wisdom sits upon his Brow, And Majesty Divine! I'm aw'd, and wish him hence. To Tel.] Well, Royal Youth! All things shall smile, and thou may'st here be happy. Thy Fatherâbut I will not tell thee nowâ First, let me lead thee to my Grotto; there In gentle Sleep thou shalt forget thy Cares, And waking bless the Storm that drove thee hither. Pleasing Visions shall attend thee, Soft Repose and blooming Joy. Smiling Hours the Gods shall send thee, Happy then their Gifts employ. Pleasing Visions shall attend thee, Soft Repose and blooming Joy. [Exeunt Calypso, Telem. and Mentor. SCENE III. Eucharis. Is this Calypso?âThis the mourning Fair, That taught the vocal Caves, and ev'ry Eccho To murmur and complain for lost Ulysses? This young Ulysses fires her Soul, I saw, I saw it in her Eyes; She gaz'd, she smil'd, and call'd out all her Charms, To sooth him into Fondness. SCENE IV. The Cave of Proteus arises, adorn'd with Coral, Shelfish, &amp;c. Sea Monsters represented around it. Proteus, Eucharis. Prot. Lovely Fair! Euch. Godlike he look'd and spoke! While sheâ Prot. Behold thy Lover! Euch. With Rapture saw and heard What well might charm a Goddess. Prot. Behold me, hear me, Thy Lover Proteusâ Euch. seeing him.] O the frightful Form! But doubly frightful now. [Aside. Pro. Proteus adores thee. Euch. O Telemachus! [Aside. Pro. The Son of Ocean wooes thee to his Bed, In Coral Caves, and Grots of shining Amber. Euch. Alas! [Aside. Prot. On the green Flood I oft have seen The sporting Sea-Nymphs in a Row, Shine in the Court of Neptune; Yet Galatea, if she view'd thy Face, Wou'd dive beneath the Waves; Nor Amphitrite's self is half so lovely. Euch. If I am lovely, will that make thee so? Proteus forbearâ Of all the various Shapes thou canst assume, Thou hast not one to please me. No, noâyou'd deceive me, Still changing, And ranging, So various a Lover I never can bear. Go, leave me, Thou Rover! To the Winds and the Waves thy Passion discover, They sooner will hear. No, noâyou'd deceive me, Still changing, And ranging, So various a Lover I never can bear. [Exit Eucharis. SCENE V. Proteus. Stay, wandring Nymph!âif I am full of Change, Thou fly'st from thy own Likeness. Stayâhear the Prophet, if you hate the Lover. Proteus will tell theeâbut she's goneâ That all the various Shapes he can assume, Are not so various as one courted Beauty; That Winds, and Waves, and shifting Sands, All, all are Femaleâyet I'll follow her. E'er this she smil'd, and now she frowns; Anon she'll smile again, While I alone am constant. Pursue, pursue the flying Fair; Tho' she fly thee, 'Tis to try thee; 'Tis a Folly to despair. Pursue, pursue the flying Fair. [Exit after her. SCENE VI. Calypso's Grotto. Calypso, Telemachus, Mentor, Eucharis, and Nymphs attending on Calypso. Cal. Behold! my royal Guest, The verdant Beauties of this Isle Wear a new Bloom to welcome thee. The spreading Vines new dress their Leaves, The sprouting Flow'rs rejoice; And Lawrels, that imbowring shade this Grotto, Spring fresh, as if aspiring to thy Brows. Here end thy Labours, And live for ever blest. Tel. O bounteous Goddess! O delightful Scene! What Thanks can I repay? A thousand Raptures fill my Breast, And glow thro' ev'ry Vein; How bright is Joy, how grateful Rest, Succeeding Toil and Pain! A thousand Raptures fill my Breast, And glow thro' ev'ry Vein. Cal. aside.] I know not why, yet still that Chief unknown Disturbs my Sightâ His Looks chastise the Pleasures of this Place, And damp my rising Joy. Tel. Ye Pow'rs! where-e'er I turn my Eyes, New Prospects rise to view, new Wonders charm me. Cal. Thy Father here enjoy'd seven blissful Years. Tel. My Father!â Cal. And had he stay'd till now, had still been happy. Tel. O say, Divine Calypso! Where may I find the King of Ithaca, Where may I find my Father? Cal. Alas!âthy Search is vain. Tel. O never will I cease, Till join'd in his Embrace, With mutual Joy I bless him, and am blest. Cal. Then know, when he forsook this Isle, His Ship was lost; And heâEnquire no more. Tel. What do I hear?âWhere am I? O Ulysses! If in Elizian Plains he roves, And silent wanders thro' the Groves; O let me thither be convey'd! I'll die to meet his happy Shade. Cal. NoâLive; be warn'd, and shun thy Father's Fate: Within this Island grows Ambrosial Fruit, Whose Juice unfading Youth bestows; When thou hast tasted this, no more Shall mortal Care approach thee. Now take secure thy Rest; An inner Grotto is prepar'd For thee and thy brave Friend; Where falling Currents from the Hills, At distance heard, invite to easy Slumbers, While Nightingales, that haunt the neigh'bring Woods, Cheer all the Hours of Darkness. No more let Sorrow wound thee; Here Peace, still hov'ring round thee, Shall smoothly guide the Night. And PhÅbus ev'ry Morning, With Pleasures new returning, Shall bless the dawning Light. [Exeunt Cal. Euch. and Nymphs. SCENE VII. Telemachus, Mentor. Tel. O Mentor, best of Friends, My Guide and my Support! What canst thou say to sooth my swelling Grief? Ment. Thy Grief is pious; And yet I fearâ Tel. Why dost thou chide me with thy Eyes? O speak!â Thy gloomy Silence wounds me. Ment. Then hear me: Let thy Father's Image Live in thy Soul, and waken all thy Virtue. Tel. Can I forget my FatherâLet these Tears Speak how I mourn his Loss. Ment. Alas! thou dost not see What Dangers here surround thee. Tel. Danger!âfrom whence? Calypso smiles. Ment. So smil'd of late the Ocean; And yet the Storm arose, by which the Ship, Ev'n on this Shore, this faithless Shore, was split. Let not Pleasure's Charms undo thee; Trust not the deluding Joy. Tho' the Syren softly wooe thee, Gayly smiling, And beguiling, She'll thy nobler Bliss destroy. Let not Pleasure's Charms undo thee; Trust not the deluding Joy. Tel. Speak thus for ever! when I hear thy Voice, I think the Gods themselves Vouchsafe to give me Counsel. i now perceive thy Fears, Lest I forget my CountryâNoâ I'll leave this charming Place, Wou'd the kind Gods but point me out the way, And favour my Return. Two VOICES. Ment. Hark, how the Voice of Fame Calls loudly, Come away! Tel. I hear th'immortal Claim, I hear, and I obey. Ment. Come, come away. Tel. I hear, and I obey. Ment. &amp; Tel. The Hero's Soul with native Fires, To Glory's noblest Height aspires, And scorns supine Delay. Ment. Hark, how the Voice of Fame Calls loudly, come away! Tel. I hear th'immortal Claim, I hear, and I obey. Ment. Come, come away. Tel. I hear, and I obey. End of the First ACT.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A large Hall, adorn'd with Trophies, Suits of Armour, &amp;c. Eucharis and Telemachus. Euch. See the fair Palace built to entertain Troy's greatest Foe, thy conqu'ring Sire! Trophies of finish'd War behold Thus plac'd around, to fill the Hero's Soul With pleasing Visions of his Labours past! Tel. The Sight reproaches meâ Why do I languish here? Is there no Troy for me to conquer? To Arms to Arms!âMentor, my Friend, where art thou? Lead me to War, to Danger, and to Glory. Euch. What means Telemachus? Tel. Let me implore, fair Nymph, thy Aid To hasten my Departure. Euch. Depart?âit must not, cannot be; Alas! thou dost not know Calypso. 'Twas thus Ulysses perish'd by her Rage; She, she destroy'd thy Father. Tel. So kind, and yet so cruel!âLet me fly Far from her sightâ Euch. Fly her Revenge you cannot, if you go; But if you stay, By me assisted to elude her Arts, You here may live in Peace. Tel. Thy generous Pity moves meâ Euch. Perhaphs there is a kinder Reason tooâ O stay! How shall I speak my secret Pain? Yet how that Pain conceal? Alas! ev'n Silence now is vain, My Looks my Heart reveal. How shall I speak my secret Pain? Yet how that Pain conceal? Tel. What do I feel. [Aside]âTurn not away those Eyes, But look againâand fix me here for ever. Ambition, cease t'alarm me! Empire and Fame adieu! Love only now can charm me; And only Love from you. Ambition cease t'alarm me! Empire and Fame adieu! [Towards the end of the Air, Mentor enters, and stands privately at a corner of the Stage.] Euch. Unhappy Eucharis! Tel. O why that Sigh? Why those soft Eyes of Sorrow? Euch. I've heard too muchâFarewel! Tel. You will not leave me? Euch. Mentor, thy Friend, will soon be here And summon thee away. Tel. Thou seest I have no Pow'r to go, Why dost thou then upbraid me? Euch. It was a sudden Fear That chill'd my boading Heart. But see!âthe early Morning calls To rural Sports, wilt thou with me Go share the Pleasures of the sprightly Chase? Tel. With thee, those Pleasures will have double Charms. Euch. I'll hasten and prepare a Sylvan Train, And e'er the Sun has drawn the Dews away, I will attend thee to the Woods To hunt the flying Prey. In all her Charms Aurora gay, Now smiling from the Sky appears. Rejoycing Birds salute the Day, And every Grove new Beauty wears. In all her Charms Aurora gay Now smiling from the Sky appears. [Exit Euch. SCENE II. Mentor comes forward. Mentor, Telemachus. Ment. Where is the Son of that Immortal Hero, Wise, Valiant, great in Arms, that vanquish'd Troy? Where is Telemachus, the Heir Of all his Father's Virtue? Tel. Alas! my conscious Eyes betray me. [Aside. Ment. If thou art heâAh no!âTelemachus Wou'd not thus coldly meet his Friend, Who brings him news of Joy. Tel. My secret Woesâ Ment. What secret Woe is that Which Mentor may not share? I come to tell thee The Gods have heard thy Pray'rs. Tel. Aside] O too enchanting Beauty! Ment. I saw just now the Bird that bears the Thunder From Heav'n descend, then tow'ring rise again, And o'er th'adjacent Grove Full to the Point of opening Day I mark'd his steady flight. That way great Jove provides The Means for our Departure. No longer let these Looks of Grief Thy drooping Courage show! Tel. Aside.] O cruel Heav'n!âby this Relief I'm deeper plung'd in Woe. To Mentor.] But, since Ulysses is no more, Why must we leave this Place? Why court new Danger? Ment. Hast thou forgot thy Native Land, The best of Mothers there, And fair Antiope, that Royal Maid That secret sighs for thee? All these demand thee. Tel. After so many tedious Years Who now expects Telemachus? Perhaps e'er this some neighbouring Prince Too potent to be long deny'd, Usurps my Father's Bed and Throne. How cou'd I bear that sight? yet how revenge Where certain Death wou'd meet me? Ment. Vain Fears!âImagin'd Danger! Confess, inglorious Youth, the real Causeâ Tel. Is Immortality then offer'd here A Cause Inglorious? Ment. It isâNor can you here obtain it: Or if you cou'dâ What is it here but Life prolong'd in Shame? Farewel!â [Going he turns back several times. Yet must I leave thee? I mustâthe Gods will have it soâ I see thee lost, undone! What can I do to save thee? Fatal Change!âwhat do I see? No more, alas! no more in thee The Hero now I trace. Where is now the sprightly Fire, That did thy God-like Soul inspire, And shew'd thy generous Race? Fatal Change!âwhat do I see? No more, alas! no more in thee The Hero now I trace. [Exit Mentor. SCENE III. Telemachus. He's goneâand Iâunhappy! His parting Looks and Voice Have struck a shiv'ring thro' my Veins, As if with him my Guardian Genius Were fled for ever from me. I'll haste and follow himâAh no! What Magick holds me here? O Mentor!âEucharis! O my divided Heart! Thy Charms alone, victorious Beauty! Can calm this Tempest of my Soul, And sooth me into Peace. O Cupid, gentle Boy, Restore me to the Fair! To Love's auspicious Joy I'll fly from gloomy Care. O Cupid, gentle Boy, Restore me to the Fair! [Exit. SCENE IV. The Grotto. Calypso. Shall Greece the beauteous Youth regain? Shall he too, like Ulysses, leave me? NoâHere in soft endearing Chains I'll hold him ever mine. O mighty Love! What is thy Flame in human Breasts, When I a Goddess yield To thy superior Sway. All Hail, Imperial Love! Not Jove himself, Immortal Jove, From thy great Pow'r is free. The spacious Realms of Earth and Sea, And all the Azure Plains above, All, all are full of thee. All Hail, Imperial Love! Not Jove himself, Immortal Jove, From thy great Pow'r is free. SCENE V. Calypso, Mentor. Cal. Mentor alone! [Aside]âIllustrious Greek, Where is Telemachus? Ment. Does not Calypso know? The Forrest now is all his Pleasure. With Ardour yet unknown His youthful Breast is fir'd; Fair Eucharisâbut sure by thy Command, Invites him to the Chase. Cal. Invites him, when? Ment. Ev'n now. Cal. Didst thou say Eucharis? Ment. Bright Eucharis, Thy loveliest Nymph, and, next thy self, divine. Cal. aside.] It cannot beâwith Eucharis! And I unknowing?â O! 'tis too plainâHaste, haste to Proteus, Say, I must see him here. [To one of her Attendants. To Ment.] But have you left your Friend? Will you not follow him? Or why, to share these Silvan Sports, Why is not Mentor there? Ment. Why not Calypso? From me, from thee he turns his Eyes; To lonely Glades, To distant Shades, From me, from thee he flies. He glows, he burns with new Delight; What can inspire This wondrous Fire? What Charms, than thine more bright? From me, from thee he turns his Eyes; To lonely Glades, To distant Shades, From me, from thee he flies. Exit Mentor. SCENE VI. Calypso. Then let him flyâ Calypso scorns the Scorner. Yet fly to whom?âTo Eucharis?â Rise, rise, ye Storms, the Forrest shake! Fall Lightning on the kindling Groves, And blastâAh no!âyet spare Telemachus. Perhaps belov'd, he loves her not againâ But sure I've seen their guilty Eyes Meet in secret Looks of Passion. Shall I then yield him?âNo, I'll yet secure the lovely Prize, And yet he shall be mine. SCENE VII. Proteus, Calypso. Prot. See, Goddess of this happy Land! Proteus is here at thy Command. For thee I leave my oozy Caves On the green Margin of the Waves. See, Goddess of this happy Land! Proteus is here at thy Command. Cal. Hear, Son of Neptune, hear Why Calypso calls thee hither. A beauteous Nymph adorns my Train, Belov'd by theeâI know thy Passion. Pro. She flies my vain Pursuit, Yet warms me more Than the bright Sun, whose chearing Beams Each Noon I seek, while my Sea-herds Sleep on the weedy Shore around me. Cal. This Day shall see her thine. Prot. O mighty Bliss! Cal. But first attend what Love and I enjoin thee. A Grecian Stranger is thy Rival.â Hast to the Woods, and find these Lovers there. Perplex their Way, disturb the Chase, And Eucharis, by me bestow'd, Shall be thy fair Reward. Let Love inspire thee; And more to fire thee, Rage, Hope, and jealous Hate combine. Haste, haste to gain her; By Art obtain her, And make th'inconstant Beauty thine. Let Love inspire thee; And more to fire thee, Rage, Hope, and jealous Hate combine. SCENE VIII. The Woods. Prelude of Instrumental Musick. Telemachus, Eucharis, and Nymphs enter as to the Chase. Euch. The spacious Woods are all around us; There lies our Way. Tel. All I see and hear delights me. Sure these are great Diana's Train, And thou the Goddess. Hark! the hollow Groves resounding Eccho to the Hunter's Cry! Hark how all the Vales surrounding To his cheering Voice reply! Now so swift o'er Hills aspiring, He pursues the Gay Delight, Distant Woods and Plains retiring Seem to vanish from his sight. Hark! the hollow Groves resounding Eccho to the Hunter's Cry! Hark how all the Vales surrounding To his cheering Voice reply! Euch. See, see!ânear yonder Brake Behold the listning Deer! Tel. Lead on; and, like thy conqu'ring Eyes, Unerring be thy Hand. [Exeunt. SCENE IX. After a Prelude of Instrumental Musick, Telemachus Re-enters. Tel. I've lost the TrackâSure there's Enchantment here. A rising Vapour, like a Cloud, This Moment stop'd my Pace, And spread a sudden Night around me. 'Tis goneâWhere's Eucharis?â My Ear will Guide me; This way I hear the Sound. [Exit. SCENE X. Proteus following Telemachus. Prot. He's now alone, Nor knows that artful Cloud was Proteus; What Likeness cannot I assume? I'll follow him, And in the Form of Eucharis, I'll more distract his Sight. SCENE XI. Proteus re-enters in the Shape of Eucharis, follow'd by Telemachus. Tel. To find thee here exceeds all other Pleasures, But why dost thou retire? Why with dejected Looks forbid my Joy? O stay, thou brightest Fair! [Proteus retires to the further part of the Scene, and as Telemachus advances towards him, sinks under the Stage: A Tree rises in his stead.] Tel. Amazing Change!âWhat do I see! O fatal Loss! O wondrous Tree! What envious Pow'r in this Disguise Removes my Charmer from my Eyes? Perhaps this Bark by Magick holds Th'imprison'd strugling Beauty. Assist me Gods to set her free! [Telemachus goes to strike the Tree, which is suddenly chang'd into Fire, and vanishes. SCENE XII. Eucharis, Telemachus. Euch. Telemachus!âalas!âsurprize Sits on thy Brow. What means this sudden Horror? Tel. O fair Delusion, stay! Hover a while to bless my Eyes, E'er thou again deceive me. Euch. Thy Words are wild! trembling thy Voice! Thou dost not know me! Tel. 'Tis she her self!â'tis Eucharis! My joyful Heart assures me 'Tis sheâvain Fears away. Euch. What Fear?âO say! Tel. Just now I saw thee here; I saw thee, or some beauteous Phantom Smil'd lovely in thy borrow'd Charms; I gaz'dâbut lost thy heav'nly Imageâ Which now arose a Tree, but soon In flashing Fire escap'd my wondring Sight. Euch. Wonder no more: Proteus, that changeful Power, was here, Who with unwelcome Passion wooes me, And took these visionary Forms To drive thee to Despair. Two VOICES. Tel. My Charmer!â Euch. My Treasure! Tel. To meet thee Euch. To greet thee Tel. and Euch. Is Joy past expressing, No more let us part. Tel. and Euch.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A Prospect, with Woods at a distance. Calypso, Proteus. Cal. Say didst thou meet his frighted Eyes, In all thy various Shapes of Terror? What Savage Form that breeds in Caves, Or haunts the Hills and sandy Desart Did Proteus wear? say, how didst thou deceive him? Prot. What Form so likely to deceive As that of soft enchanting Beauty? I caught him with the seeming Smiles Of Eucharisâthat false, yet charming Fair. Cal. Where are they now? You said they met again. Prot. Yet Proteus still was near; And folded in a Serpent's Train I lay conceal'd, where weary with the Chase She led him to a cheering Banquet. Curse on the Sight!âI saw, I saw The Nymphs officious wait around, And fill in flowing Cups ambrosial Juice To make the flatter'd Boy Immortal. Cal. Return, return, Why did you leave 'em? Prot. To tell thee, Goddess, He's now alone; the treacherous Nymph To hide her Passion comes t'attend on thee. Cal. Proteus, she's thine this Momentâ Alone?âOnce more I'll see him? [Aside. Come ev'ry Grace adorn me! To charm those Eyes that charm me, Love now thy Aid supply. Or if th'Ungrateful scorn me, Ye rising Furies arm me! Unpity'd he shall dye. Come ev'ry Grace adorn me! To charm those Eyes that charm me, Love now thy Aid supply. [Ex. Cal. Prot. SCENE II. A Canopy in the Wood. Telemachus sleeping. Mentor. He smilesâhe dreamsâGay Visions fill his Soul Of golden Scenes and bright Elysian Pleasure. O fond deluded Youth!âTelemachus, When, when wilt thou awake To Virtue, and to Fame? He knows not Mentor yetâSleep on. Another Mentor shall deceive thy Eyes, E'er yet the destin'd Hour is come to save thee. [Exit Mentor. SCENE III. Telemachus still sleeping. Calypso. This is the PlaceâAlas! What awes me entring here? Sure something sacred hovers near him. See!ârosy Bloom, and brighter Youth Shine in his Face!âHas Eucharis Improv'd those Charms?âHe smiles, As if he heard that pleasing Name; And even in Sleep he seems to scorn Calypso. Fond Love be goneâRevenge, Revenge! This Spear shall right my injur'd Beauty. [Snatching his Hunting Spear. But seeâHe smiles again! Perhaps he dreams that Eucharis Has made him now Immortal. This to convince theeâNoâ [Going to strike, she stops. E'er yet I strike the fatal Blow, I'll tell him how he wrongs me. Awake! impending Vengeance see: Once more behold the Day and me. Then sink to Shades of endless Night, And catch with dying Eyes the Light. Awake! impending Vengeance see! Once more behold the Day and me. He wakesâmy fainting Anger dies. [Throws away the Spear. O Tyrant Love! O weak Calypso! Tel. waking.] Where is my Eucharis, my Fair? Alas!âCalypso!â [Starting. Cal. What! dost thou start to view me here? Ungrateful!âdoes thy Guilt affright thee? Or dost thou know Calypso comes To take Revenge for all her slighted Bounty. Tel. Revenge! Cal. Where is my Eucharis, my Fair?â Did not that Name recall thy Doom, Returning Pity wou'd have spar'd thee. Tel. My Doom?âwhat Causeâwill great Calypsoâ Cal. I'll hear no more. Fly from my Isle, Invader, fly! Yet shall my Rage Like Lightning blast thee in thy Flight. Fly to thy Nymph, thy Eucharis, And see if she can save thee. [Exit Calypso. SCENE IV. Telemachus. Can Death alarm me?âDo I dream? Or did I tast the wondrous Juice That can bestow Celestial Youth and ever blooming Joy?â Alas!âstill mortal Sorrow pains me. O Eucharis!âO only Fair! If I must live, yet losing thee, Take back th'immortal cruel Gift, And let me dieâor still be happy. Hear me, Love, my Sorrows ending; While I wander thro' this Shade, Venus, with thy Doves descending, Guide me to the beauteous Maid. All ye smiling Loves attending Come in pity to my Aid. Hear me, Love, my Sorrows ending; While I wander thro' this Shade, Venus, with thy Doves descending, Guide me to the beauteous Maid. [Ex. SCENE V. Proteus following Telemachus. Still I trace thee, hated Boy! Nor shalt thou now escape my Furyâ [Going he turns back. Yet stayâI saw, upon the winding Shore, As on a pointed Rock I sate, When first he landed in this Isle, I saw a Friend of Godlike Port attend him. I mark'd that Stranger's Mienâ Where is he now?â I'll wear his Visage, and decoy My Rival to his Ruin. Ye Monsters that sleep In Cell of the Deep, To revenge your great Master prepare. I'll seize, and I'll throw To the Waves my proud Foe, Then soon I'll recover the Fair. Ye Monsters that sleep In Cells of the Deep, To revenge your great Master prepare. [Ex. SCENE VI. Eucharis. He's goneâTelemachus!âNo Voice replies. Thro' all the spacious Hollows of the Wood A sacred Silence reigns. Telemachus!âAlas! Ev'n Eccho now is mute. He's goneâPerhaps for ever. O Proteus! O Calypso! How shall I now appease you? Cruel Cupid, break thy Darts! Love and Conquest are no more. Vain are all my softer Arts; Hope deceives me, Pleasure leaves me, I must now my Loss deplore. Cruel Cupid, break thy Darts! Love and Conquest are no more. Exit. SCENE VII. The Sea Shore and the Cave of Proteus. Proteus enters in the likeness of Mentor, follow'd by Telemachus. Tel. Gods! can it be? Does Mentor then approve my Passion? How shall I speak My grateful Soul, and my o'erflowing Joy? YetâWhither dost thou lead me? Proteus enters the Cave, and returns immediately in his own Shape. Prot. Behold that Mentor now! Proteus, thy Rival! Tel. Assist me mighty Jove. Prot. In Mentor's Shape I had no Pow'r to harm thee; But now thy Life is mine. [Telemachus drawing his Sword is seiz'd by Proteus. Mentor enters, and Proteus loosing his hold, runs into the Cave, and sinks with it into the Sea.] SCENE VIII. Telemachus, Mentor. Tel. What Hand Divine?â My Friend!â'tis he, the real Godlike Mentor! Yet how can I with guilty Eyes behold him? Ment. Return, return to Friendship and to Glory! Tel. O noâI'm lost in Shame. Why did you save me?âlet me dyeâ Yet let me dye within those generous Arms! I cannot liveâ And think how I have wrong'd thy wondrous Bounty. Ment. This glowing Virtue on thy Cheek Restores thee to thy self and me. Yet flyâTelemachus! Fly from this enchanted Ground That sinks away beneath thee; Snares and Ruin Are spread thro' all the treacherous Soil. Tel. Lead me, my Guardian Spirit, save me! But oh!â Ment. What is that breathing Sorrow? Tel. O Eucharis! Alas! forgive my Soul's returning Softness. Ment. Awake from that illusive Dream! She's gone, the fleeting Shadow's gone; Calypso gives her to the changeful God, The Price of vow'd Revenge on thee. Tel. O let me once behold the mourning Fair! Ment. Still she deludes thee, Th'alluring Cup she lately gave Was fill'd with noxious Juice T'inslave thy Reason's nobler Pow'rs. Two VOICES. Ment. O break the Charm, the Charmer leave, Nor let her more thy Heart deceive. Tel. I'll break the Charm, the Charmer leave, Nor shall she more my Heart deceive. Tel. 'Tis doneâO false ensnaring Beauty! In this last SighâFarewel. [Aside. [Here a Machine of Clouds descending fills the Stage, separating Mentor from Telemachus.] Tel. Where am I now? O lost Telemachus? Does Mentor too forsake me? See! see what stores of Vengeance are descending? Great JoveâI wait thy mighty Will, Here end my Life, or ease my Sorrow! Joy forsakes me, Hope is fled. Break ye low'ring Clouds asunder, Pour your Thunder Quick on this devoted Head! Joy forsakes me, Hope is fled. [The Clouds opening on a sudden, the Stage is illuminated, and in the midst of the Machine Mentor now appears as Minerva.] SCENE IX. Minerva, Telemachus. Min. Telemachus! despair no more. Tel. O all ye Pow'rs! What Sound familiar strikes my Ear! What Glories open to my Sight! Minerva's Form!âthe Voice of Mentor! Min. Minerva now behold, Who long conceal'd in Mentor's Form Attended thee thro' ev'ry Danger, To guide thy wandring Youth, and in thy Soul To raise and finish all the growing Hero. Fly false Delights!âUlysses lives. Calypso wrong'd thy fond belief; Ulysses lives, and thou again shalt see him. Tel. kneeling.] Daughter of Jove! Celestial Maid! O let me ever thus adore thee. Min. Ariseâto Ithaca I'll now convey thee; There bright Antiope, That beauteous Daughter of the Cretan King, Shall Crown thy chaster Love With ev'ry Charm, and ev'ry Royal Virtue. Think on the Honours of thy Race, and know, When hoary Age and ripening Fame Shall gather to the Gods thy Sire, Telemachus shall fill his Throne, And shine in all his propagated Glory. See those golden Beams, how bright! Heav'n descends in streaming Rays, And foreshows thee joyful days. Pallas guards thee, Jove Rewards thee; Happy Years begin their flight. See those golden Beams, how bright! Heav'n descends in streaming Rays, And foreshows thee joyful days. [Telemachus goes into the Machine with Minerva. As it is ascending, Calypso, Proteus and Eucharis enter.] SCENE X. Calypso, Proteus, Eucharis, and Nymphs. Prot. Calypso, see where he ascends! Behold the Pow'r Divine that guards him, Mentor no more, but great Minerva! Cal. aside.] O hated sight!â Euch. O Proteus! what have I endur'd For scorn of thee? Prot. Complain no more; but smile, and make me happy. Cal. Robb'd of my Love and my Revenge! Jove, 'tis thy WillâI'll hence, away, And give a loose to Frenzy and Despair. 'Tis vain to strive against superior Gods; Yet shall my Fury blast the tainted Earth, And split the trembling Rocks around me. No longer here shall Nature smile, Nor Spring perpetual grace my Isle; Hence all ye flatt'ring Pleasures, fly! Eternal Gloom blot out the Day! Fade ev'ry Flow'r! each Tree decay!â O that Calypso too cou'd dye! FINIS.</field>
