      <field name="fulltext">THE ALEXANDRÆAN TRAGEDIE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument. When Alexander the Great, after all his Conquests (shining with the glory of innumerable victories was returned backe to Babylon, where the Ambassadours of the whole world did attend his coming, as one who was expected to command over all there, being admired by the Grecians, adored by the Barbarians, and as it were drunk with the delights of an extraordinary prosperity, he suffered himselfe to be transported with an inundation of pleasure; till sitting at one of his feasts by the meanes of the sonne of Antipater, one of his Cup-bearers, in the best both of his age and fortune, he was suddenly poysoned. Incontinent after his death, those who were in greatest estimation with himselfe during his life, and then with the Armie, assembled themselves together neglecting for a long time his funerals, whilest busied about the disposing of his Empire: at last (after divers opinions) it was concluded, that if Roxane, the widow of their Soveraigne, (who was then at the point to be delivered of her birth) happened to beare a sonne, he should succeed in his Fathers place, and till he were come to some maturity of age, Perdiccas, Leonatus, Craterus, and Antipater were appointed to be his Tutors: But the foot-men in a disdaine, that their advice was not required, proclaimed Arideus, Alexanders bastard brother, King, and gave him a guard, of which Meleager procured himselfe to be made Captaine. At this sudden alteration, the horse-men being troubled, following Perdiccas, pitched their Camp without the City, yet on the end, this tumult being by the eloquence of Perdiccas appeased, all the Captains re-assembled themselves, and having divided the Provinces, made an agreement, which lasted not long. For, such was the vehement ambition of those great men, that with all manner of hostility, they studied how to undermine one another, and first of all Meleager after a pretended reconciliation though having fled to a Temple for refuge) was slaine by the appointment of Perdiccas, who (after aspiring to a superiority over the rest) whilest he went to warre against Ptolomie in Ægypt, by a sudden mutiny of his owne Souldiers, was miserably murdered. Then the onely Captaine of his faction who remained alive, was Eumenes, a man singularly valorous, who encountring with Craterus and Neoptolemus, by the death of themselves defeated their Army, whereby being highly advanced, he was greatly envied: and (Leonatus having lately before dyed in a conflict betwixt him and the Athenians.) Antigonus in the name of the rest, was sent against him with a great Army, betwixt whom there having passed divers skirmishes with a variable successe, and some private conference without agreement: In the end, he was betrayed by his owne Souldiers, and delivered bound to Antigonus, who shortly after caused to take his life. Then Antigonus (his rivals in the authoritie being removed out of his way) did aspire to that himselfe, from which he was sent to seclude others, and having murdered divers of the governours, he disposed of their Provinces as he pleased: whereof Cassander, Ptolomie, and Lysimachus, advertised by Seleucus, who fled for feare of incurring the like danger; did enter together in a league against Antigonus. Now at this time Olympias plagued all the faction of Cassander in Macedonie, having caused Arideus and his Queen Eurydice to be put to death; by which, and by some other cruelties (having lost the favour of the people) she was constrained, when Cassander came against her, to retyre her selfe within a Town; which (by reason of the scarcitie of victuals (not being able to defend) she rendered, together with her selfe to Cassander, by whom notwithstanding of his promise to the contrary) she was violently deprived of life, and so having proceeded so farre in wickednesse, he thought it no time to retyre till he had extinguished all his Masters race; whereupon he caused Roxane and her sonne to be murthered, and soone after, Hercules, Alexanders bastard sonne; which multitude of murthers, gave to him the Crowne of Macedonie, and to me the subject of this Polytragicke Tragedie.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act 1. The Ghost of Alexander the Great. Back from th'umbragious caves (still rob'd of rest) Must I returne, where Phœbus guilds the fields, A Ghost not worthy to be Pluto's Guest, Since one to whom the world no buriall yeelds. O what a great disgrace is this to me, Whose Trophees Fame in many a kingdom keeps. That I (contemn'd) cannot transported be A passenger for the Sulphurean deeps? Dare churlish Charon (though not us'd to bow) The raging torrent of my wrath gain-stand? Must I succumbe amidst hels dungeons now, Though all the world accustom'd to command? But it may be that this hath wrought me harme, What bloud-lesse Ghosts do stray on Stygian banks, Whose falls (made famous by my fatall arme) Gave terrour oft to many martiall ranks? Yet (for a prey expos'd to ravenous beasts) Could never have the honour of a Tombe; But (though for such rude guests too pretious feasts) Were basely buried in a brutish wombe. Thus (as it seemes) the horrour of such deeds, With like indignity attends my sprite; What stormy breast this thirst of vengeance breeds, To plague for that which valour did acquite? Ah! might Alcmena's sonne (as sonne of Iove) Once force the driery forts of endlesse night, To match sterne Dis in the Tartarian grove, And draw forth foaming Cerberus to light? Then leading Theseus through the dungeons darke, A second rape aym'd for their ravish'd Queene, Durst he (hels terrour) force the fatall Barke, By squadrons pale (an envi'd victor) seene: And in my rage may I not tosse this Round, Till roaring Earth-quakes all the world affright, Heaven stain'd, hell clear'd, earth torne, all to confound Enlightning darknesse, or else darkning light? What, though I from terrestriall Regions swerve, Whom in this state (it may be) some mistake? May not the voyce of Alexander serve To make th'earth tremble, and the depths to shake? Or, straight return'd, shall I my fortune trust, And th'Earth dispeople, slaughtring scatt'red hosts; Then Pluto plague, all charg'd with bloud and dust, When men are kill'd to be a King of Ghosts? O how I burst to thinke how some above, Who for their glory did my steps attend, My off-springs title proudly do disprove, And to my Chaire by violence ascend: “Ingratitude doth grieve a generous sprite, VVould God therefore that with a body stor'd, I might returne these Traitors to acquite, My back with Armes, my hand charg'd with a sword: As when I entred in a populous Towne, To warre alone with thousands in my wrath, Whil'st (prizing honour dearer then my Crowne) Each of my blows gave wounds, each wound gave death: Then thundring vengeance on rebellious bands, I would make them redeeme my grace with grones, Where now my Ghost (empall'd with horror) stands, Lesse grac'd then those whom I commanded once; And yet the glory by those Captaines had, Whom first my Ensignes did acquaint with fame, Doth make my soule (whil'st hating them) more sad, Then all the suff'rings that the hells can claime. O now I see what all my Minions blindes, To grace my funerals that they take no paine! My state (betraying me) distracts their mindes, Who have forgot all love, save love to raigne; But Ptolomie doth yet by time intend To Alexandria to transport me once, Not mov'd by love, no, for another end, In hope my Fortune will attend my bones. And must I then so great a trouble have (To whom the Earth did all belong before) For some few foots of Earth to be a grave, VVhich meane men get, and great men get no more. Though many thousand at my signe did bow, Is this the end of all my Conquests then To be thus barr'd that little circuit now, A benefit even common unto men? But of those kingdomes which were thrall to me, Lest that a little part my body bound, Th'earth arch'd with heaven my fatall bed should be, Still unconfin'd, and even when dead, yet crown'd. O blinde ambition! great mindes viprous brood, The scourge of mankinde, and the foe to rest, Thou guilty art of many millions bloud, And whil'st I raign'd, didst raigne within my brest; This to my soule but small contentment brings, That I some Cities rear'd, and others raz'd And made Kings captives; captives to be Kings, Then whil'st the wond'ring world did stand amaz'd. All that doth now but torture after death, Which rais'd my Fame on pillars more then rare; O costly conquest of a little breath, Whose flattring sounds both go and come with th'aire! Can I be he who thought it a disgrace To be but weigh'd with other mortals even, Who would be held of an immortall race, The off-spring of great Iove, the heire of heaven? By many meanes I all mens mindes did move, For Altars (as a God) with off'rings stor'd, Till of his glory Iove did jealous prove: “All kings should reverenc'd be, but not ador'd. Ah! whil'st (transported with a prosp'rous state) I toil'd to raise my Throne above the Starres, The thund'rer straight (who still doth pride abate) Did wound my fame with most infamous warres. Made I not grave Calistenes to smart, Who did disdaine a mortall to adore, (What knowne unknowing) bent by foolish art, Though but a man to be imagin'd more? All fear'd the danger of my roaring wrath, (Like Lyons when asleep) which none durst wake; My fury was the Messenger of death, Which when enflam'd, made flaming squadrons quake: Ambition did so farre my thoughts engage, That I could not abide my Fathers praise, But (though my friend) kill'd Clitus in a rage, Who Philips Fame durst in my presence raise. Thus though that I mine Enemies did abate, I made my greatest friends become my foes, Who did my insolence (as barbarous hate) And for the like afraid wail'd others woes. Those tyrannies which thousands chanc'd to see As inhumane a multitude admir'd: And my familiars strangers growne with me, As from a Tyrant for distrust retyr'd: Yea, there were many too who did conspire By base ambushments to have snar'd my life, Of all my labours, loe, this was the hire! “Those must have store of toils who toile for strife And I remember that amid'st my joyes, (Even whil'st the chase of Armies was my sport) There wanted not a number of annoyes To counter-poise my pleasures in some sort. “Of those on th'earth most happy that remaine, “(As ag'd Experience constantly records) “The pleasures farre exceeded are by paine: “Life greater griefe then comfort still affords. What griefe, no, rather rage did seaze my soule. Whil'st bigge with hopes a battell bent to prove! That sudden sicknesse did my course controull, Which (cold when kinde) embracing flouds did move. From the Physician then (though deem'd for ill) I took his potion, gave him scandalous lines; Then whil'st he red did drinke, yet ey'd him still, And by accusing looks sought guilty signes; Not that suspitious feares could make me sad, This was the ground whence did proceed my paine, Lest death my victory prevented had: For, I was sure still where I fought to gaine, But when that I extended had my state From learned Athens to the barbarous Indes, Still my tumultuous troups my pride did hate, As monstrous mutinies unmask'd their mindes. I (so my name more wonderfull to make) Of Hercules, and Bacchus past the bounds, And (whil'st that Memnons Sunne-burnt bands did quake) Did write my worth in many a Monarchs wounds. Kings were my Subjects, and my servants Kings, Yet my contentment further did require, For, I imagin'd still more mighty things, And to a greater greatnesse did aspire. The spatious carriere of the speedy Sunne, (All quickly thrall'd) like lightning I o're-ran: Yet wept, and wish'd more worlds t'have been wonne, As this had wanted roome to ease one man, No wonder I was thought a God by some, Since all my aymes (though high as heaven) prevail'd, And what man (save my selfe) did still o're-come? Of all my fancies, never project fail'd. This made me thought immortaliz'd to be, Which in all mindes amazement yet contracts: I led blinde Fortune, and she courted me, As glad to grace the greatnesse of my acts. Yet I have found it a more easie thing, To conquer all whereon the Sunne ere shin'd, Then mine owne selfe, and (of my passions King) To calme the tumults of a stormy minde. What comfort justly could my soule receive Of all my Conquests past, if that even then Whil'st I triumph'd (to wrath and wine a slave) I scap'd not scandall more then other men Ah! (seazing without right on every state) I but my selfe too great a Monarch made, Since all men gap'd to get the golden bait Which by my death seem'd easie to be had; Whil'st from humanity too much divorc'd, My deeds all hearts with feare, and horrour fill'd, I who by foes could never have beene forc'd, By friends did fall, yet not over-com'd, but kill'd. But now I see the troublous time draws neare, When they shall keep my obsequies with bloud: No wonder too, though such a warriours beere, At last doth swimme amidst a scarlet floud: For, as my life did breed huge broils o're all, My death must be the cause of monstrous cumbers, And it doth best become a strong mans fall, To be renown'd by ruining of numbers. The Snake-tress'd Sisters now shall never need Their fatall fire-brands, loathsome Pluto's pests, Nor inspirations strange whose rage doth breed A thirst of murther in transported brests. Ambitions flames may from my ashes shine To burne my Minions mindes with high desires, Each of their sprits that hath a spark of mine, To ruine all the world, may furnish fires. The Beauties of the Earth shall all look red, Whil'st my Lievtenants through that pride of theirs, With Armes unkinde huge streames of bloud do shed, By murthering of my heires, to be my heires. Is this that Greatnesse which I did designe, By being eminent, to be o're-throwne, To ruine first my selfe, then root out mine; As conquering others, but to lose mine owne? O happie I, more happie farre my race! If pleas'd with that which was our ancient rent, I manag'd had th'Æmæthian pow'r in peace, Which was made lawfull by a long discent: Then farre sequestred from Bellona's rage, I had the true delights of Nature tri'd, And ag'd with honour, honour'd in my age, Had left my Sonne secure before I dy'd; And he inheriting a quiet state (Which then because lesse great had beene more sure) Had (free from envy) not beene harm'd by hate, Which of most States the ruine doth procure; But since they will en-earth my earthly part, Which now no badge of majestie retaines, To roaring Phlegeton I must depart Farre from the lightsome bounds of th'airey-plaines And must I there who did the world surmount (Arrested by the Monarch of the Ghosts) To Rhadamanthus render an account Of all the deeds done by my ravenous hosts There whil'st with Minos Æacus sits downe, A rigorous Iudge in hels most horrid Court, With me who passe his Nephew in renowne, (Though of his race) he no way will comport. O what pale Ghosts are here together brought, Which were of bodies spoil'd by my Decree! And first Parmenio without whom I nought But who did many great things without me: At the tribunall of Tartarian pow'rs, He aggravates ingratitude too great, And (whil'st the raging Tyrant foaming lowres) All whom I wrong'd, for vengeance do entreat: Yet guilty thoughts torment me most of all, No sprit can be by plaguing furies pin'd, (Though charg'd without with snakes, within with gall) As by the stings of a remording minde. If it be true that drowsie Lethes streames In darke oblivion drowne all things at last, There, let me bury farre from Phœbus beames, The loath'd remembrance of my labours past. Exit. Chorus. VVhat strange adventures now Distract distressed mindes With such most monstrous formes? When silence doth allow The peace that Nature findes, And that tumultuous windes Do not disturbe with stormes An universall rest: When Morpheus hath represt Th'impetuous waves of cares, And with a soft sleepe bindes, Those Tyrants of the brest, Which would spread forth most dangerous snares To sink affliction in despaires: Huge horrours then arise The Elements to marre, With most disastrous signes: Arm'd Squadrons in the skies, With lances throwne from farre, Do make a monstrous warre, Whil'st furie nought confines: The Dragons vomit fire, And make the Starres retire Out of their Orbes for feare, To satisfie their ire, Which heavens high buildings not forbear, But seem the Crystall Towres to teare; Amidst the ayre, fierce blasts Doe boast with blustring sounds, To crush this mighty frame, Which (whilst the tempest lasts) Doth rent the stately rounds, To signifie what wounds To all her off-springs shame, Shall burst th'earths voynes with bloud, And this all-circling floud, (As it the heavens would drowne) Doth passe the bounding bounds, And all the scalie brood, Reare roaring Neptunes foamie Crowne, Whilst th'earth for feare seems to sinke downe, Those whom it hid with horrour! Their ashy lodgings leave, To re-enjoy the light, Or else some Panicke terrour Our judgement doth bereave, Whilst first we misconceive, And so prejudge the sight; Or, in the bodies stead, The genius of the dead Turnes backe from Styx againe, Which Dis will not receive, Till it a time engendring dread, Plague (whilst it doth on th'earth remaine) All else with feare, it selfe with paine. These fearefull signes fore-show (All nations to appall) What plagues are to succeed. Since death hath layd him low, Who first had made us thrall, We heard that straight his fall Our liberty would breed; But this proves no reliefe: For, many (O what griefe!) The place of one supply; And we must suffer all; Thus was our comfort briefe: O! rarely doe usurpers dye, But others will their fortune try.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 2. Scene 1. Perdiccas, Meleager, Ptolomie, Antigonus, Eumenes. What eye (not big with teares) can view this host, Which hath in one (ah, as the end doth prove) A King, a Captaine, and a brother, lost, Crown'd, follow'd, try'd, by right, for worth, in love? I thinke amongst us all, there is not one, Whom divers favours doe not justly binde To please that Heroes Ghost (though from us gone) With all the off'rings of a thankefull minde. Ah, had the fates beene subject to my will, So great a losse should not have crost our life; But we had kept great Alexander still, And he those kingdomes which procure this strife. “Yet heavens decrees can never be recall'd, “And thoughts of harme past helpe, breed double paine, “Though once to griefe a space, by passions thrall'd, “The living must embrace the world againe. As one whose intrest in that Prince was chiefe, A sorrow singular my soule affects, But I will not defraud the generall griefe, To waile a-part particular respects. Though all the ayre still Ecchoes plaintive sounds Of widow'd hopes now wedded to despaires, Yet time must cicatrize our inward wounds, And to the publike good draw private cares. Let us give physicke to the sickned state, Which at this present in great danger stands, VVhilst grudging Subjects that our greatnesse hate, By bloud would venge their violated lands. “Those who by force are thrall'd, to be made free, “Precipitate themselves in dangers still, “And this of Nature seemes a rule to be: “What Realme not scornes to serve a strangers will? “From forc'd obedience, nought but hate proceeds; “The more we have subdu'd, the more our foes: A soveraigne head this States huge body needs, That might make us securely to repose: And who more meet to have that great mans place, Of those whose states he tooke who gain'd the hearts, Then one descended from that Regall race, Whose birth both worth and right to raigne imparts? If heavens enrich Roxane with a Sonne, That long'd-for birth a lawfull Soveraigne brings, And till that course of doubtfull hopes be runne, Let some be nam'd who manage may all things. Anti. The Macedonians (swolne with wrath) would scorne, That to their King a stranger should succeed: Can men obey a Babe, a Babe not borne? What fancies strange would this confusion breed? This could not well become our grave fore-sight, A doubtfull birth so long t'attend in vaine, Which may abortive be, and brought to light, (Through natures errour) made not apt to raigne. But if affection carry us so farre, That of that race we must be rul'd by some, Though neither train'd by time in peace, nor warre, As those who must indeed by kinde o're-come: Then have we Hercules the eldest sonne, To our great Prince by faire Barsines borne, Who fourteene yeares of age, hath now begun His Princely birth by vertue to adorne. Ptol. To thinke of this, it makes my soule asham'd, That we should serve a base Barbarians brood, What? should we beare the yoke that we have fram'd? To buy disgrace, have we bestow'd our bloud? Our ancestors whose glory we obscur'd, Would get some vantage of their off-spring thus: That peoples bondage they would have procur'd, And have we warr'd to make them Lords o're us? Ah, bury this as a most odious thing, Which may bring danger, and must breed our scorne. Though (in effect) descended from our King, They (come of Captives) are but basely borne. O! brave Leonides, I like thy strife, Who with so few perform'd so glorious things, And death preferr'd before th' infamous life, Which bondage still from a Barbarian brings. Those (loath to take a stranger for their Lord) Did with their bloud renowne a forraigne field, And shall we honour them whom they abhorr'd, And even (though victors) to the vanquish'd yeeld To what did tend that eminent attempt, Which makes the Persians yet abase their brow? But to our countries scorne (in a contempt) To take by force that which we offer now. Was this the scope of all our conquests then, Of abject Captives to be made the prey? No, let us still command like valorous men, And rule our Empire by some other way. May we not use this policy a space, Till Time afford, or we a course devise? Least dangerous discord doe disturbe our peace, Still when we would of serious things advise; With Majestie let us assembled be, A sacred Senate with a chayre of state, That of the Soveraigne pow'r all signes may see, Then whilst we compasse that respected seate: There, those who were in credit with the King, Whose merits in mens mindes have reverence bred, Shall (weigh'd by judgement) ballance every thing: How kingdomes should be rul'd, how armies led; “And what the greatest part hath once approv'd, “To that the rest will willingly incline; By such a harmony the Army mov'd, Will execute what ever we designe. This concord would prove happy for us all, Which each mans state free from all danger renders: And by this meanes our Macedonie shall In place of one, have many Alexanders. Eum. Though silence (I confesse) becomes me best, Who, am a stranger, and the lesse beleev'd, Yet of your toyles since I a partner rest, I must unfold my minde, a minde much griev'd: And thinke you that a Babe repaires our losse? How can good wits so grosly be beguil'd? This in all Countries hath been thought a crosse: “Woe to that soile whose Soveraigne is a childe. Nor would these great men (as is thought) agree, They be too many bodies for one minde: Ah (pardon Ptolomie) it cannot be, This union would disjoyne us all I finde: Thus would the Army from good order swerve, “If many might forgive, all would offend, “As thinking well though they did death deserve: “No man so bad, but some will him befriend. And when so many Kings were in one Court, One Court would then have many humours too, Which fostring factions for each light report, Would make them jarre as neighbouring Princes doe; No, let this strange designe be quite supprest, “Whilst equall all, all would unequall be, So that their mindes (by jealousie possest) From pale suspition never could be free. But ah! what needs contention at this time, To cloud a matter that was made so cleare: And doe you now account it not a crime, To damne his will, who once was held so deare? When that great Monarch march'd to match with death, Whilst all his Captaines were assembled there, And did demand (whilst he dispos'd of breath) Whom he himselfe adopted for his heire: Then (that none might such doubtfull questions breed) As loving valour more then his owne race: He (that a brave man, brave men might succeed) Said: let the worthiest have the worthiest place. Nor did he speake this in a secret part, With double words which might more doubt have mov'd. As breathing thoughts in each ambitious heart, To have his worth in Vulcans fornace prov'd: For, whil'st ye hedg'd the fatall bed about, (With an unpartiall care distracted long) Then he amongst you all did chuse one out, Who for so great a charge did seeme most strong. He to Perdiccas did present the Ring That us'd to seale the secrets of the State, By which it seem'd that he design'd him King, And so would seaze him of the regall seat. Thus made this worthy man a worthy choice, That further strife might not the state deforme, And all the world now justly may rejoyce, That who rais'd many, did prevent this storme. For, if he had not thus declar'd his will, Yee (Mars his Minions) should have liv'd at jarres: Whil'st emulation amongst equals still, Had made sterne Trumpets thunder civill warres; What huge disorders threatned to burst forth, If that our Soveraigne had no Prince design'd, Who oft hath beene a witnesse of our worth, And can weigh vertue in a vertuous minde? I see consenting signes applaud my speech: Rise, doe, Perdiccas, that which they decree, Whil'st modesty doth Majesty impeach, Though thou crav'st not this Crowne, this Crowne craves thee. Meleag. I wonder not though thus Perdiccas shrinke, To take this place, still brag'd with new alarmes: The Sunne must make nights ugly bird to winke: This Scepter weighs, too much for so weake armes. The Gods will never grant, nor men agree, That such a one should tyrannize o're us: Though vulgar mindes might yeeld his thralls to be, His betters scorne to bow so basely thus. He would have us Roxanes birth t' attend, Which though it come to passe as some expect, He can exchange, or cause be brought to end, As bent to like all meanes, when one effect. Thus would he temporize to our great scorne, Till time might helpe to further his designes: No Kings Perdiccas likes, but babes unborne; He labours well in undiscovered Mynes. I need not now insist to tell at large, What brave men are amid'st this martiall band, Who better doe deserve so great a charge, Both for their skill, and courage to command; Yet are the best not worthy to succeed, That man admir'd who never can be match'd, The thought of whom must make our mindes to bleed, Whose adversaries this advantage watch'd. But, if that great man did consent so soone, That our obedience should be thus abus'd, Of all that ever yet he would have done, I thinke this onely ought to be refus'd. That valorous band, whose worth the world oft prov'd, Then, whil'st their glory shin'd through silver shields: By all that Monarchs deeds when no way mov'd, (As conquer'd) would have left the conquer'd fields. And when despising such a Princes throne, To whom his ancestors their Scepter brought. What reverence would they beare to such a one, Who all this time was as their equall thought? “To those who o're their equals raise their state, “Advancement envy breeds, and envy hate; “If such with all would rest familiar still, “This in contempt the Soveraigne title brings: “And if they second not their Subjects will, “Men cannot beare with them, as with borne Kings. Our lofty bands some lofty minde must tame, Whose Princely birth doth procreate regard; Whose Country may confound each slandrous clayme, As one with whom none else can be compar'd. Loe, Alexanders brother, Philips sonne, Who alwayes was a partner of our paine: Can there be any else below the Sunne, O're Macedonians who deserves to raigne? And I must wonder what so strange offence Hath forfeited his title, maym'd his right? That any now with a disguis'd pretence Dare wrong him thus, even in his peoples sight. Ptol. None needs to wonder much, though we neglect One whose election might procure our shame: His mothers basenesse, justice might object, Whom bastardy secludes from such a claime. But yet had Nature purg'd the spot she made, We with his birth the better might comport, If (like his Syre, fierce squadrons fit to leade) His parts were such as might the State import; He falsifies his race, of wit so weake, That all his inward wants are soone perceiv'd, All of his judgement in derision speake, By which great things can hardly be conceiv'd: And though his body might from paines be spar'd, Whose constitution is not very strong; But with infirmities so farre impair'd, That it alive cannot continue long; “Yet since in State he never hath beene school'd, “His ignorance would racke him still with feares: “Whilst he who rul'd, still needing to be rul'd, “Spoke but with others tongues, heard with their eares. “A King inconstant, great confusion makes, “Whom all mistrust, and most amid'st a Campe: “Whilst (soft like waxe) he each impression takes, “A little labour changing still the stampe; “Ah, should our lives depend upon his breath, “Who of himselfe cannot discerne a crime: “But for each rash report damnes men to death, “Then yeelds a fruitlesse pitty out of time. “Thus whilst some alwaies must his judgement sway, “Which still doth harbour in anothers head, “Of Sycophants this Prince may be the prey, “Who where they list him (as quite blinde) will leade. “And since but base, that they may be the best, “Such still will toyle, that we may be o'rethrowne: “And to the credulous King may meanes suggest, “To taint our fame, lest it obscure their owne. What griefe were this to us, whilst such as those Might make their vantage of th' all-pow'rfull breath? And that our actions ballanc'd by our foes, Were guerdon'd with disdaine, or else with death? Me. Since private hopes your judgements doe bewitch, I'le leave this counsell where no good can please: Come follow me all those who would be rich: Few have regard (poore souldiers) to your ease. Perd. That shall prove best which first I went about, Though some would wrest my words from what I thought: Loe, Meleagers spite doth now burst out, Like flaming fires which burne themselves to nought. Thus, naughty mindes which never dreame but ill, Doe construe all things to a crooked sense: What I propos'd, reposing on your will, He would interpret for a great offence. And (thus puffd up) this parting hence of his, To many former faults hath added one: By his seditious words incens'd ere this, The souldiers are to sacke the treasure gone. Ant. With one consent then let us all conclude, That Alexanders race (when borne) must raigne: So shall we stablish still that sacred bloud, Which rais'd our state, and may it best maintaine. And let us now (before we part) appoint Who shall command till that the babe be borne: And circumspectly ponder every point, That successe so our Councell may adorne. Eum. I heare a tumult rais'd amongst the Tents, And Arideus is proclaimed King: To which the multitude (soone chang'd) consents, As bent for all whose course a change may bring, The foot-men are to indignation mov'd, In this assembly that they want a seat, Where our proceedings they might have approv'd, As knowing all that did concerne the state. They soone forget their Prince (exspecting spoiles) That dare revolt from what we all advis'd: “Thus too much liberty breeds many broiles, “And makes the giver still to be despis'd. “The want of discipline all things confounds. Their deeds want order, and their pride all bounds. Perd. And dare they then against that fortresse rise, Where Alexanders Ensignes are displaid? Or violate the walles where as he lyes? May not his shadow make them all afraid? What? how comes this? and dare they then presume, To bragge their Captaines, and abuse their Armes? Armes, armes, just wrath these Rebels must consume, Our count'nance will them curbe, sound, sound th'alarmes. Exeunt. Scene 2. Lysimachus, Seleucus. Loe, here a great and more then sudden change! All men for mirth were like to have gone mad, So that of late it would have beene thought strange, In all this Citie to have scene one sad. Each wall resounded some melodious song, To ravish curious eares with rare delight; Strange Tapestries were stretch'd the streets along, And stately objects made to charme the sight; As if our King his conquests so would crowne, Of all the world a Parliament to hold, He (plac'd with pompe in this imperiall towne) Did of magnificence the height unfold. Here glory (in her richest robes array'd) Should have shewne all that Greatnesse could expect: Yet were our hopes even at the height betraid: To death those Trophees fortune did erect. A tragicke end this triumph quite confounds, All our applauses vanish in complaints, Our Musicke marr'd by melancholy sounds, Loe, by the Cypresse press'd, the lawrell faints. To funerall shrikes, our shouts of joy we turne, (With gorgeous garments, Griefe cannot comport,) We that so much rejoyc'd, farre more must mourne, “Dayes spent with woe are long, with pleasure short. This breeds most anguish, when that one compares The present time with others that are past, Whilst wonted hopes are ballanc'd with despaires, Which all heroicke mindes with woe doe waste. Betwixt these two, what difference finde we forth, The rising Sunne, and it that is declin'd? Where is that Zodiacke (lodging of all worth) Whence valours beames (still lightning courage) shin'd? Now desolation spreads it selfe o're all: A solitary silence, griefe allowes, Ah, (as quite crush'd by that great Monarchs fall) How many male-contents cast downe their browes? A strange suspition hath possess'd the streets, VVhilst every man his neighbours fall conspires, Each one who unawares another meets, (As fearing treason) with distrust retires. Of rumours strange each eare is greedy growne, VVhich (though but doubtfull) move the minde to rue, And (doting still on that which is their own) VVhat they conjecture, all affirme for true. Sel. VVith eyes that flames for rage, our deeds heaven viewes, And (mov'd for us) a high disdaine doth beare; Loe, all mens heads are heavy for ill newes, And though we know not what, yet still we feare: For, since the widow'd world doth want a head, Each member now doth labour to be chiefe, VVhich (whilst they divers wayes the body lead) May give beginning to some endlesse griefe; Some (like the foole who thunder fayn'd like Iove) VVould make their fame like Alexanders sound, And (all brought low) to be themselves above, VVould order all, or else would all confound; Then some vaine wits which onely would seeme wise, (By flatt'ring mirrours of their shape deceiv'd) Doe every thing that is not theirs despise, And perish would, ere them another sav'd. A number too whom all things doe content, VVhat each one thinkes, are still resolv'd to doe: They make a choice, then doe the choice repent, And straight repent of that repentance too. The publike good is spoil'd by private hope, VVhilst many thus high dignities doe claime; This discord gives to rash ambition scope: “For, all would fish within a troubled streame. See how dissention hath dissolv'd so soone, All kinde of order, and confusion brought: Our Councell quite his variance hath undone, “VVhilst one would have done all, all have done nought: Although Perdiccas (as it would have seem'd) VVhilst for his masters race he onely stood, Sought (by that meanes more vertuous to be deem'd) His Princes honour, and his Countries good; Yet his companions having in contempt, He did by subtile meanes himselfe advance: And so to shadow his disguis'd attempt, Aym'd at the royall place as but by chance; He toyles that the unborne none should beguile, As by the heavens for th' Orphanes good reserv'd: Yet wanting of a King nought but the stile, He would not want that when th' occasion serv'd. And Meleager partially dispos'd, To hinder others, doth pretend a love To bastard Philip, by effect disclos'd, Since he but seekes Perdiccas to disprove; And if that foe, whom he doth feare, but faile, He cares not much what Emperour they proclaime: And his designe with many may prevaile: “A cloake of right, apparels any claime; “They whose descent some title doth disclose “(As by their birth made capable to raigne:) “Must be preferr'd by reason unto those, “Who of all right without the bounds remaine. The furious foot-men (insolently stout) A title to maintaine, did brave our band, And (indignation thundring threatnings out) Would with our bloud have bath'd this barbarous land. O! what indignity would this have been, Whilst those whom we subdu'd with such great toiles, Had in this sort their victors vanquish'd seen, So of their spoilers purchasing the spoiles Thus darkening all that we had done before, (Our swords first stayn'd by ignominious wounds) We, of our conquests could have kept no more, But burials base (if those) in th' enemies bounds. O! what excellency consists in th' one, (Though oft not mark'd till miss'd) cleare at this houre: “Some with a word, or look, doe more alone, “Then thousands joyn'd with policy and pow'r. When squadrons arm'd with Ensignes full displaid, As of their Prince all due regard quite lost, His generous course would (obstinate) have staid, By them abandon'd, when endanger'd most; Then of disorder yeelding bitter fruits, They boldly march'd with bragges before his Tent, And charg'd their Soveraigne with unlawfull suits, To innovations violently bent; Of duty then, they by no band detain'd, First grudg'd, grew factious next, last rebels plaine, Like waters for a time (by Art restrain'd) Their bounds once pass'd, which do all bounds disdain: But from that patterne of accomplish'd worth, Whom imitate none may, all must admire, Through just disdaine when fury spark'led forth, These troupes (astonish'd) trembling did retire; His stately count'nance calm'd tumultuous sounds, And lightned Majesty through clouds of wrath, That (even as if his words had given them wounds) They fell, afraid of him, though not of death: Those lofty bands which were of late so proud, That they disdain'd to wait their Emperours will: Then (by his looke all at an instant bow'd) Did beg but leave that they might serve him still; And yet what wonder though he gain'd all hearts; Which to his presence happened to repaire, With that perfection of all vertuous parts, As large in him, as in all others rare? Loe, when we meet to treat, by peace or warres, How all our conquests may be best secur'd, The Souldiers doe burst out in publike jarres, Even by their Captaines no respect procur'd. And who can call that valorous Prince to minde, That unto vertue any reverence beares; But he must be constrain'd, or prove unkinde, To offer up a tribute of some teares? Lysi. His death doth make my soule faint sorrows prey, Though many thought that I for it had long'd; For, if by any whom he should obey, One can be wrong'd, then I indeed was wrong'd. Sel. Though fame abroad by divers tongues did bring, To what huge danger you were once expos'd; It did not paint out each particular thing, Which by your selfe I long to heare disclos'd. Lysim. When wise Calistenes for no request, With superstitious customes could comport, But with franke words all flattery did detest, He was abus'd, and in a barbarous sort: “So plaguing him (no doubt) the King did ill, “Yet to prosperity we must impute “Those fatall faults which follow fortune still, “As of great mindes a kinde of bastard fruit; “We should in Kings, as loth their state to touch, “Speake sparingly of vice, praise vertue much. But I whose soule that wise man dearely lov'd, Whilst his perfections spying thus injur'd, (To tender passions by compassion mov'd) Would his reliefe have willingly procur'd. But when my credit fail'd, all hope quite past, That I could purchase grace in any sort: I desp'rate physicke did afford at last, That if his life was ill, it might be short. The King enrag'd, that I had thus presum'd To limit his revenge by giving death, That by a Lyon I should be consum'd, Did throw my doome out of the depths of wrath; But when with rowling eyes the Lyon roar'd, He, by my strength (as strengthlesse) was o're-thrown, Which to the King whose minde did then remord, My constancy and courage both made knowne, So that incontinent I was set free, By this rare proofe esteem'd amongst the strong, And with a minde from inward rancour free, As he his wrath, so I forgot the wrong: For, whilst alone he through a Forrest rang'd. A prey expos'd, yet did no danger dreame, Some at that time had former wrongs reveng'd, If but for mischiefe bent to gaine a name; Yet that which others did attempt in vaine, And (tyr'd by travell) of a surfet dy'd, I did performe, and brought him backe againe, As swiftly running as his horse could ride; And of that deed my sprite rests well appaid: For, since that time my Soveraigne held me deare, Which afterwards he to the world bewraid, Whilst by this meanes his favour did appeare. VVhen unawares my brow he chanc'd to wound, To stay my bloud which striv'd to dye his Launce, He with his Diadem my Temples crown'd, A happy signe though comming but by chance; And O! who knowes but once before I dye, Some good event may second the presage? Seleu. What hinders us but we should fortune try, And for a Crowne our travels straight engage? Those bended mindes which ayme at Greatnesse still, “(Growne popular, of purpose to be prais'd:) “Doe winde themselves in every mans good will, And would seeme humble, that they may be rais'd. “What counterfeited friends seale trustlesse bands, “VVhilst in the generall cause that wit pretends, “Though never joyning hearts, all joyne their hands “And worke one way, yet worke for divers ends? Yea, those whose mindes move in the sphere of State, Have purchas'd pow'rs, as purpos'd for the fields, VVith jealous mindes their rivals to abate, VVhilst (equals all) none to another yeelds; Yet with suspended thoughts they doubtfull stand, And their designes to venture doe forbeare, Least all the rest joyn'd by a generall band, Doe him o're-throw, who first gives cause of feare; But he may speed who for a Crowne doth thirst, And (free from feare) with courage doth advance: Some to be second, doubting to be first, Will make their course depend upon his chance; And by a battell if that one prevaile, There will rich hopes at easie rates be sold, Whil'st those seek help, whose Fortune then doth faile, As first by hope, last by despaire made bold, All this to me great cause of feare affords, Lest that we two protract the time too long; And wounded be before we draw our swords: “All at such times must do, or suffer wrong. Lysi. No chance of late hath brought me so to bow, But I have throwne some thoughts at those high hopes: “Yet in my minde that man do most allow “Who doth with judgement moderate fancies scopes: Those Provinces which are to us assign'd, As calme in minde, we manage must a space: Till all attempt that which they have design'd, By enterchanging damage and disgrace: Then living but like those whose force is small, From which the world no great thing can expect: We shall professe a favour to them all, As who nought else, save publicke peace affect; Yet then, our thoughts shall not have leave to sleep, But subtle plots must circumspectly frame, Those whom we feare at variance still to keep, So alwayes strengthning us, and weakening them; If wrongs provoke, or when occasion claimes, We may make warre with some ere it be long, Like cunning wrestlers at th'Olympick games, Who exercise themselves to be more strong; And when themselves have thus prepar'd the way, Whil'st that their pompe doth beare a lower sayle. (For at the last their force must much decay, Since all must alwayes lose, though one prevaile) Then prompt to tempt that which we now contrive, (By ruining the remnant that remaines) We may possesse the state for which they strive; Thus they the toils, and we shall get the gaines. Exeunt. Chorus. O happy was that guiltlesse age, When as Astræ, liv'd below And that Bellona's barbarous rage Did not all order quite o'rethrow Then whil'st all did themselves content With that thing which they did possesse, And gloried in a little rent, As wanting meanes to make excesse; Those could no kinde of want bemone, For, craving nought, they had all things: And since none sought the regall Throne, Whil'st none were Subjects, all were Kings: “O! to true blisse their course was set, “Who got to live, not liv'd to get. Then innocency naked liv'd, And had no need, nor thought of Armes, Whil'st spightfull sprits no meanes contriv'd, To plague the simple sort with harmes; Then snaring laws did not extend The bounds of Reason as they do, Strife oft begun where it should end, One doubt but clear'd to foster two: By conscience then all order stood, By which darke things were soone discern'd, Whil'st all behov'd there to be good, Where as no evill was to be learn'd: And how could any then prove naught, Whil'st by example vertue taught? Then mortals mindes all strong and pure, Free from corruption lasted long, (By innocency kept secure) When none did know how to do wrong; Then sting'd with no suspitious thought, Men mischiefe did from none expect: For, what in them could not be wrought, In others they would not suspect; And though none did sterne laws impart, That might to vertue men compell, Each one by habite in his heart, Had grav'd a law of doing well: And all did wickednesse forbeare Of their free-will, and not for feare. The first who spoyl'd the publike rest, And did disturbe this quiet state, Was Avarice, the greatest pest Which doth of darknesse fill the seat: A Monster very hard to daunt, Leane, as dry'd up with inward care, (Though full of wealth) for feare of want, Still at the borders of despayre; Scarce taking food for Natures ease, Nor for the cold sufficient clothing, She whom her owne could never please, Thinks all have much, and she hath nothing: This daughter of sterne Pluto, still Her fathers dungeon strives to fill. That Monster-tamer most renown'd, The great Alcides, Thebes glory, Who (for twelve severall labours crown'd) Was famous made by many a story, As one who all his time had toyl'd To purge the world of such like pests, Who robbers rob'd, and spoylers spoyld, Still humbling hauty Tyrants crests, He by this Monster once o're-throwne, Did passe in Spaine o're lands and flouds, And there took more then was his owne, What right had he to Gerions goods? Thus Avarice the world deceives, And makes the greatest Conquerours slaves. Ah! when to plague the world with griefe, This poore-rich Monster once was borne: Then weaknesse could finde no reliefe, And subtiltie did conscience scorne: Yet some who labour'd to recall That blisse which guilded the first age, Did punishment prepare for all, Who did their thoughts to vice engage; And yet the more they laws did bring, That to be good might men constraine, The more they sought to do the thing From which the laws did them restraine: So that by custome altred quite, The world in ill doth most delight.

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. Scene 1. Perdiccas, Eumenes. Now Fortune smyles upon my rising State, And seemes to promise more then I require; Loe, by degrees my glory doth grow great, And by their death who did my death conspire. Proud Meleager who disdain'd to bow, And my advancement alwayes did mislike, Hath with his bloud seal'd my assurance now, To fright all those who would attempt the like. Eum. Yet of his fall the forme my minde appalls, Even at Ioves Altar, and without regard; We were too rash to violate those walls Which the most impious could not but have spar'd. Lascivious Ajax by Minerva's spight, Earst for prophaning such a sacred place, On the Capharian Rocks did lose the light, And all his Navie too for ones disgrace. “We should not irritate celestiall powr's; “And, all beginnings are considered most: Such horrour breeds this odious act of ours, That we (I feare) opinions pow'r have lost. Per. Let others seek to keep such points as those, I am not scrupulous, for, I protest, Ov'r all, and by all meanes I'le kill my foes, And then thereafter argue of the rest. “They wrong the Gods who think their Church should be “A refuge free for Malefactors still: “For, with their justice this cannot agree: “Who guard ill doers, guilty are of ill. Was he not stain'd with many a monstrous crime, And Salamander-like amidst the fire (Contentiously dispos'd) did spend his time, And (never pleas'd) did still some change require? Eum. “One hum'rous head that doth in brawls delight, “May poyson thousands with the gall of spight. Per. As still seditiously affecting strife, He but abus'd the credit of his King: And sent some of his slaves to take my life, Such bitter envy did his stomack sting. Eum. I saw, how that advanc'd before our band, You first did check, then chase them in the end: And did with courage resolutely stand, Our Soveraignes corps (though dead) bent to defend. Per. “He but a dastard is who basely yeelds, “And in no conflict hath his Fortune try'd, We (if in time not ventring to the fields) Like beasts (all sacrific'd) had poorely dy'd: But when without we masters did remaine, (Lest Babylon had straight beene barr'd from food): I those proud squadrons quickly did constraine Even as we pleas'd, a Treaty to conclude. Grac'd whil'st my foe (as in some kinde compar'd) A chiefe in charge, he many mindes did sway, But (found inferiour) when a friend declar'd, My credit did increase, and his decay. Eum. Yet in this course all (who observe) do see, That of the multitude the minde prevail'd: He whom they did elect our Prince must be, And our designe hath altogether fail'd: But how comes this? that every Captaine gets A certaine Realme committed to his charge, And with an Army bravely forward sets, Their bounds allow'd to guard, or to enlarge? Per. I by my means have every great man crown'd, That from my greatnesse great things might proceed: Yet by that meanes to make my pow'r renown'd, The doing lik't me better then the deed; I this division chiefly did procure To have those great-men from the Court remov'd, Where they might be imploy'd, yet I secure, Their favour purchas'd, or at least thus prov'd: For, him who hath them to such honour brought, They must be bound to hold in high account, And their advancement for this end I sought, That by their meanes I with more ease might mount. Eum. O! but your fancies may be much deceiv'd, “There is no bond can binde unthankfull mindes: I feare the favour that they thus receiv'd, Hath showne them wayes to sayle by other windes. So long, of late, as they had need of you, To seeme your friends they (courting kindnesse) sought: But since their greatnesse is well grounded now, They will disdaine what derogates in ought. “To those all great men friends most frankly prove, “Whom (for their pleasure) freely they affect, “And (loathing bands) cannot be forc'd to love, “As brav'd by worth, when merits urge respect. “Few mark from whence they rose, when once aloft, “None can endure that they should owe their state: “Desarts grow odious when upbraided oft, “And are deprav'd, not guerdon'd, when too great. “Yea, in my judgement you have greatly err'd, “Them to exalt, whose state you would surprise: “Their common custome is who are preferr'd, “That they may stand, not to let others rise. Per. “To ruine loftie mindes when least afraid, “Whil'st carelesse carriage jealous censures sift, “By spyes abroad to foes at Court betray'd, “Then by preferrement what more subtle drift? Their hearts with hate are parted all by pride; One is already to confusion gone: I long to learne how Leonatus dy'd, Not that I minde his funerals to bemone. Eum. That Prince magnanimous whom all admire, (As was his custome) clemently proclaim'd, That banish'd Grecians might to Greece retyre, Save onely such whom murder had defam'd; But who them banish'd, griev'd for their returne, Did feare what just revenge might have design'd, As knowing well (whil'st wrongs make wrath to burne) “How misery doth irritate a minde; The indignation which they had conceiv'd, Did breed rebellion bursting out with rage, The which our King (deep in his minde ingrav'd) By Athens spoyles did purpose to asswage: But since that death afforded them releefe, Growne bold to prosecute their proud attempt, Th'Athenians, and th'Ætolians were the chiefe Who brought Antipater first in contempt; And by their pow'r constrain'd to quite the field, He (in a little Towne enclos'd) at last, Was once reduc'd in danger neere to yeeld, And staine the glory of his actions past; But yet by accident as oft it falls, “(It better is to happy be, then wise) An unsuspected shaft throwne from the walls, Their foes chiefe Captaine happened to surprise; Then did Antipater his courage reare, Which had almost his stagg'ring hopes betray'd: Yet still in doubt, and not quite free from feare, He Leonatus did intreat for aide; And he who seem'd his friendship to affect, To further him desirous did appeare; But (if he had prevail'd) some do suspect, Antipater had bought his succours deare. Yet by the end his purpose bent to show (How ever in effect) he seem'd a friend; But when th'Athenians did his coming know, They him to fight did all directly tend. And though their thoughts in depths of doubts did fleete, They when alone, to match him thought it best, And whil'st they march'd th'adventrous troups to meet, Did hardly welcome the unwelcome Guest: When both the Armies were to battell brought, And shew with what bright flames their breasts were stor'd, Brave Leonatus like a Lyon fought, So to prove worthy of his wonted Lord: But whil'st he bravely did his charge acquite, Yet lost himselfe, who others came to save, And by their Captains fall discourag'd quite, His scatt'red troups great damage did receive; When old Antipater was surely told Of their mishap, who came for his reliefe, He not one signe of sorrow did unfold: “A little gaine doth mitigate much griefe: Well did he know that though his foes prevail'd; Yet this great fight enfeebled had their host, And then he took to him which much avail'd Those beaten bands who had their Captaine lost; Yet that in which he did most comfort finde, Was his delivery from a secret foe, Who did with jealousie torment his minde, Though outwardly not seeming to be so. Per. Thus, we who earst below one ensigne warr'd, Slept in one Tent, and all one Fortune prov'd, And (with a friendship then, that never jarr'd) Like Pilades, and mad Orestes lov'd, Since that we want a Lord, and all are Lords, We (loe) renounce all kinde of kindnesse now, And (secret rancour budding in discords) Do others harmes procure, at least allow. “Such is the sacred famine of a Crowne, “That it to satisfie, before we faile, “What in our way doth stand, all must go down, “And bands of bloud, or friendship not availe “These glory-ravish'd souls that would be great, “No meanes omit, although they be unjust, “None beares with patience partners in the state; “What jealous lover can his Rivals trust? Eum. Well, I perceive Antipater doth tend With all his pow'r to gaine that sacred prey, Whose meanes (of late enlarg'd) to reach his end: Through every danger may enforce a way; And Alexander sometimes spake at large, Then whil'st Antipater with Agis striv'd, That he (without the limits of his charge) More like a King, then a Lieutenant liv'd. Antigonus, and Ptolomie in Armes Are joyn'd in one, our ruine bent to breed; I feare that friendship procreate our harmes, Unlesse their spight prevented be with speed. Per. I'le lodge you now (Eumenes) in my brest, And let you see the ground of my intent: Since that we both alike must toyle, or rest, As those whose courses must have one event. Since at his death, I by our dying Lord, Was in his place appointed to succeed, And that my Fortune doth a meanes afford, How I may compasse that which he decreed. To leave that place I cannot well agree, As if I wanted courage to command, I'le take that which the fates do force on me: For, if without a Throne I cannot stand. “And those who would performe difficult things, “Must not regard what way, so they prevaile: “Oft fraud, then force, a greater furtherance brings “The Foxe must help, if that the Lyon faile. So old Antipater to have betray'd, His daughter I in marriage did require, That so the time might but have beene delay'd; Till that I had accomplish'd my desire: For, with the shadow of pretended love, And hop'd affinity which seem'd design'd, I from his bounds some bands aym'd to remove, By raising me that he might have declin'd; “But who can snare a minde all ey'd with fears He quickly did mistrust the purpos'd wrong, And from my Messengers straight barr'd his eares, As did Vlysses from the Syrens song. Eum. Yet this, (if rightly weigh'd) might much import, If that you match your selfe with such a Mate, Whose beauty, pleasure, birth might bring support, And both concurre in one to blesse your state, If you to make your high attempts more sure, By Hymens meanes with some your selfe allie, Thus of some Prince you may the pow'r procure, On whom for help you boldly may relye. What griefe were this if you have hap to gaine, That faire Idea which your fancies frame, If after you, none of your owne remayne To keep your Conquests, and revive your name? “Kings live most safe who of their owne have heires, “Whose sacred persons none dare seek to wound: “Since, though they dye, yet there rest some of theirs, “Who are to venge their death, by Nature bound. Per. All shall be try'd which may enlarge my might; I minde to match my selfe with such a one, Who (if she have my pow'r to prove her right) May be thought worthy of her Fathers Throne. I with Olympias have devis'd a thing, Which may secure her state, and make mine strong, And (if accomplish'd) prove a prosp'rous spring, From whence may flow great acts ere it be long: By Cleopatra may a meanes be catch'd, Which to a glorious end our course may bring, She whom at first her Father Philip match'd With Alexander of Epirus King, Who having heard great Alexanders fame, (In emulation of that Monarchs praise) Went with his troups th'Etrurians bent to tame, Which enterprise did but abridge his dayes: In marriage with that widow'd Queene combinde, (If that her Mother thus her course assist) Whil'st I performe that which I have in minde, Who dare presume my purpose to resist? For, whil'st this friendship doth my name renowne, It may my thoughts from further feare seclude: Since having thus a title to the Crowne, As one engrafted in the royall bloud. Eum. I feare that this your purpose to prevent, A number now take armes all in one forme, As those whose feares conjecture your intent, And by the lowring clouds fore-know a storme. Already many do together runne, Who for our ruine wonderfully thirst. Per. Where do you think that we should then begin, And exercise hostility at first? Eum. Though we our selves in strangers Thrones enstall, And (having Asia to subjection brought) Make Nilus, Indus, and Euphrates thrall, Yet all those victories would serve for nought, Whil'st Macedonie doth continue free, (A fertile field to bring brave Armies forth) Which (till first forc'd) can now not subject be, And ere they love a King, must prove his worth, “Then unto those who seek a Prince in Armes, “His chiefest Realme the greatest vantage gives, “Where warres (held out) are alwayes with his harmes, “Since that his foe still at his charges lives; “And warres protracted with a peoples losse, “Do from their Soveraigne alienate their love; “They lose their hearts, whom Fortune once doth crosse, “And foil'd at home, can no where else remove: Who Macedonie hath, hath still the best, Which of our state the stately Mistrisse is: As which with courage conquer'd all the rest, And but depends on Mars, as onely his: If you were Lord of that undaunted soyle, And by Olympias countenanc'd but a time, Straight from Antipater all would recoyle, And, bent t'undo him, we would finde a crime; To you who are a Macedonian borne, (If match'd with Cleopatra, great in pow'rs) The Macedonians gladly would be sworne, And (if commanding them) then all were yours. Per. Yet this opinion partly I disprove, Which would not (as you thinke) our troubles end: For, if we do from hence our force remove, And to th'Æmathian bounds directly tend, There must at first a doubtfull warre be prov'd, With those brave bands whose valour is well known: Of whom Craterus dearly is belov'd; Antipater is borne, and bred their owne. And though indeed (as kindly to those parts) My friendship may affected be by some, Yet those who start in time by many arts, May under-myne their mindes before we come. Then whil'st we trouble Macedony most, And leave those Realmes unarm'd which now are ours, Straight Ptolomie when strengthned is his host, May (like a tempest) swallow Asia's pow'rs. I, for the time most willingly would take The course which seemes to make our state most sure: “A foe is dangerous, when behinde ones backe, “(Who whil'st not look'd for) may our harme procure My purpose is, though yet to none made knowne, That Egypt first shall burden'd be with warre: For, if that Ptolomie were once o'rethrowne, Then that from Greece all hope of help would barre. Eum. Hold still with you those of the sacred bloud, Whom to protect you alwayes must pretend: “The count'nance of the great, may do much good, “Whom still (though weake) all glory to attend. Exeunt. Scene 2. Olympias, Roxane. Let sorrow prove a tyrant to my soule, Whose rage with reason now no measure keeps; What of my teares the torrent can controull, Since flowing from afflictions deepest deeps? How can my breast but burst whil'st sobs rebound, Since once the seat of joyes now not the same? May not huge horrours presse me to the ground, In thinking what I was, and what I am? I was a great mans wife, a greaters mother, Even she to whom the heavens their best did give, Yet, I, even I, more plagu'd then any other, In dungeons now of desolation live. My sonne who was the glory of his time, Staine of times past, and light of times to come, (O fraile mortality! O slippery tyme!) Though having all o're-com'd, death did o're-come. And I (dejected wretch) whose dying eyes (By Natures custome bound) he should have clos'd, Was not to shut his starres with th'yvory skies, Which curtain'd once where Majesty repos'd: But ah! his falling in a forraine part Hath (if ought can enlarge) enlarg'd my griefe, Or else on him I melted had my heart, And spent my selfe to purchase his reliefe. Yet though I was not present at his death, He shall not be defrauded of my teares: But for his funerall fires my flaming breath Shall smoak, and to his Ghost a tribute beares. Rox. Ah! to what corner rolls my watrie sight, Where it not findes some matter to bemone? O foolish eyes! why lose ye not your light, Since your delight is lost, your object gone? Once of all Queenes I might the fortune scorne, To whom just love that great man did engage, Whose match in worth the world hath never borne, Nor never shall enrich another age. When those perfections do transport my minde, Which admiration doth disclose too late; I curse the fates that did his judgement binde, To make me partner of so high a state. And I repent that to his sight I past (Though highly grac'd) once on a festuall day, A feast which many a time must make me fast, And with slow woe that flying mirth defray; Then if my fortune had not blinded me, But ah! whose judgement had it not bereav'd? Whil'st that great Monarch daign'd to like of me, Of my high flight I had the fall conceiv'd. Of Asia's Prince whose state did then decline, He both the wife, and daughters had at will, Whose beauties lustre might have darkned mine, Yet free from snares restrain'd his fancies still. And when my father chose out from the rest Those Virgins all whom Fame affirm'd for rare; Though having view'd them all, he lov'd me best, Then thought most fortunate, if not most faire; And when this match his Nobles all dismai'd, That he himselfe with captives had alli'd: That act, he then (as love had dited) said Took from the vanquish'd shame, from victors pride; Yet me (as Empresse) all did entertaine, Though his inferiour farre in all respects, Till I from him by death divorc'd remaine, Whom with his Sonne now all the world neglects. Olymp. Although this will but aggravate my woe, From whom the fates all comfort now seclude, Yet I do tender his remembrance so, That of my Sonne to heare, it doth me good; And (daughter) now to double my distresse, Make me at length acquainted with his death, That sorrow may each part of me possesse, Sad news mine eares, teares eyes, and sighs my breath. Rox. Though griefe to me scarce liberty affords, To presse forth passions which oppresse my minde, Yet would affection wrestle out some words To speake of him who all my thoughts confin'd; When he had conquer'd all that could resist (A Monarchie not equall with his minde) Still in his haughty course he did insist, And search'd the Ocean other worlds to finde: But when from it his Navy was redeem'd, He stood in doubt where Trophees next to reare: The world (though large) for him too little seem'd: His minde could more conceive, then Nature beare. Last (ah!) this Emp'rour purpos'd was in th'end, At Babylon his glories hight to show, Where all the world his coming did attend; As Iove above, who onely raign'd below. When he drew neare that then thrise Monarchs seat, The Astrologians by their skill fore-told, What danger huge was threatned to his state, The which else-where might better be contrould: But he who was not capable of feare, And could not muse of misadventures then, Would triumph there, and the worlds Scepter beare, Back'd with moe Kings then other Kings with men. There (as a God) transporting mortals sights, (Which mirth with mourning I must still record) He spent, or lost a time, in all delights, Which Fortune could (when flatt'ring most) afford, Till Thessalus, for mischiefe but reserv'd, Once to his house invited him to dine, Where false Cassander at the Table serv'd, And as he us'd with water mixt his wine. Olymp. Alas, alas, and so it prov'd in th'end, “But who could feare a benefited friend? Rox. There were all creatures valued for their worth, As wholsome, dainty, sumptuous, stately, rare, Which (forc'd by Phœbus) th'Easterne Realmes bring forth, To live by Sea, by Land, or in the ayre. Then when that Reason drunk with pleasure slept, Which all the senses with abundance stor'd, And whil'st (save Musicke) nothing measure kept, With Ceres, Bacchus onely was ador'd. Even when the King beginning was to drinke, (As strangely mov'd) he thund'red forth a grone: And from the Table suddenly did shrinke, His wonted vigour at an instant gone; Whil'st he was softly to a Chamber led, That death a title to his body claim'd, The sorrowing Souldiers swarm'd about his bed, With looks once fierce, then for compassion fram'd: But he whom victory had still array'd, With others past this battell bent to even, Did look like one whom all the world obey'd, And boasted shortly then to take the heaven: Whil'st (lightning comfort to afflicted bands) He stretch'd them forth to kisse in severall parts, By Sword then Scepter his more honour'd hands, On which, it seem'd, they melted all their hearts. Last, unto them those gen'rous words he told: Yet to my life my death doth bring no blot: Thus, to dye yong in yeares, in glory old, Of all our Family is still the lot; And since no worlds are resting to o're-come, Life serves for nought; I did an Empire found: Liv'd, warr'd, and raign'd (all done) for which I come: Then goe great Ghost (not griev'd) below the ground. No further weighing what belong'd to life, He with a count'nance constant even in death, (As too victorious in that fatall strife) The ayre perfuming, spent th'imperious breath. But through the Campe when that it once was knowne, That from the world that world of worth was gone, What anguish was, it cannot well be showne, I had my part, yet had not all alone. O! let that day which makes my dayes all night, Be registred amongst the dismall dayes, Whose melancholy, and portentuous light With some disaster still the world dismayes. And Babylon, curst be thy fatall towres, Once seate of Monarchs, Mistresse of the earth, But from hence-forth (a slave to forraine pow'rs) Still burden'd be thy bounds with bloud and dearth. Olym. You need not use those execrations more, Though Babylon of breath that Prince depriv'd, Yet (as an Oracle had told before.) In Macedonie was his death contriv'd; Antipater had heard, how divers times The King against him had been mov'd to wrath, And damn'd (as guilty of opprobrious crimes) His sonne in law Lincestes unto death. Then he was told, the King did strictly try How his Lievtenants had their places us'd, Still making all as traitours straight to dye, Who had the same in any sort abus'd; Thus, he who well did know his owne misdeeds, Had learn'd by others what he might expect, As whose ambitious brest in pride exceeds, And alwayes did a Soveraignty affect: But when Craterus was to have his place, And he requir'd the Army to attend, He thought that thus Time would some means embrace, To plague his pride with a deserved end; Then to prevent that which I thinke was still More fear'd by him, then purpos'd by the King, With guilty thoughts oft exercis'd in ill, He sought what might to death his Soveraigne bring; And this the traitour compass'd at the last, As I (alas!) have learn'd (although too late) When to my sonne, his sonne Cassander past, As to congratulate his prosp'rous state; Then in his company he did retaine A poyson powerfull where it was employ'd, Whose violence no metall could restraine, But in a horses hoofe was still conveigh'd, He and his brother fit occasion watch'd, And for their Prince a cup of poyson made; Thus he who never could by force be match'd, By treason, loe (O cruell fate!) lyes dead. Rox. And could, or durst those traitors be so bold, The pillar of all worth to undermine? But (Madame) ah, Antipater of old, Against your greatnesse alwaies did repine. And (I remember) on a time he sent A messenger of minde to make you bow, Who to your Sonne a letter did present Full of invectives to discredit you; The King whilst reading what it did comprise, Did smile with scorne, then to Hephestion say: In writing of such things he is not wise, Which straight one mothers teare will wipe away. Olym. I oft inform'd my sonne (strange waies devis'd) How that disloyall man striv'd to be great: But as a womans wit, mine was despis'd, And construed still unto the sense of hate. Yet of my Sonne (I thought) the deeds were such, That all men them admir'd, none envy could; And that none durst his sacred person touch, Whom men ador'd, and Iove as his did hold. How oft have I those bitter throwes allow'd, By which I brought that demi-god to light? And well I might of such a birth be proud, Which made me glorious in the peoples sight; Though divers too (as I have some time knowne) To draw his love from me did wayes prepare, Yet were their slights by dutious love o're-throwne, And I respected with a reverend care. His tender love to me was much extold, Then when he sought to stablish a decree, That with Immortals I might be enrold, And (as a Goddesse) honours have to me. Ah! how can I this tragicke time survive, Who lost a sonne so great, a sonne so kinde? And all the meanes which make me now to live, Is with revenge a hope to ease my minde. Rox. His love to you it could not but abound, (By nature, parents of their owne are lov'd) Since those to whom he by no band was bound, Of his humanity the fruits have prov'd. His clemency did make his state more sure, Then all the terrours rising from his name, Which whilst he liv'd, did publike love procure, And after death a never dying fame. Old Sisigambis lifting up her heart, (Of her owne sonnes the death who had surviv'd) To Alexander did that love impart, Which was to Darius due while as he liv'd; But when these tidings wounded had her eares, That heaven from th'earth had rob'd that praise of men: (Whilst all dissolv'd in slouds of bitter teares) She hated life, as never spoil'd till then. Her widow'd nephew groning at her feet, Who of Hephestion did the death bewaile, In depths of woe she (drown'd with teares) did fleet, Till that o're-whelm'd, her strength began to faile; Then barr'd from food, she groveling did abide, Till that lifes course (then hastened fast) was runne: Thus she surviv'd her sonne, yet with him dy'd, In whom she found the kindnesse of a sonne. Olym. If but when hearing this his tragicke end, A stranger (once his Captive) dy'd for griefe, Ah, shall his mother yet on hope depend, As such a losse might looke for some reliefe? And yet I will, for 't were a great disgrace To me the mother of that matchlesse man, (Like other women) to give fortune place, And faintly yeeld as vulgar wretches can. Though griefe at first must mollifie me once, Or (as unnaturall) I might be admir'd Yet will I not still burst my brest with grones; Then that, of me more courage is requir'd, I'le not degener from my generous kinde, “(Faint-hearted Hindes brought never Lyon forth) “Nor yet a Mother of an abject minde, “Had never borne a Monarch of such worth. And O! who knowes, but once the time may come, That I to venge my selfe a meanes may have? Whilst those vile traitors ruin'd are by some, Who with their bloud may bath their Soveraigns grave. Now on Perdiccas I repose my trust, Who with Eumenes would our wrongs redresse; Their valour (ventring in a cause so just) By all appearance, promise doth no lesse. Rox. Loe, now of late delivered of a sonne, I to those Captaines scarce dare make it knowne, His kingdomes all to part who have begunne, And might (by killing him) make them their owne. Ah! (Madame) this doth move me most to pause; Who of those great men the ambition feare, Lest by pretending but a publike cause, They seeke themselves the Diadem to beare. Thus, they of my yong babe (fraud masking wrath) Would but be Tutors first, and Traitors then, Farre from obedience, duty, love or faith: “No things more deare then Diadems to men. Olym. As those whose courage cannot be dismaid, Let us now strive what way a force to finde; And whilst that pitty doth procure for ayde, The peoples passions tune unto our minde. If that their love not vanish'd with his life, Of Alexander (in a high degree) I thinke the Sonne, the Mother, and the Wife, By Macedonians still must reverenc'd be. And this doth with disdaine my soule consume, That Arideus amongst other wrongs, And proud Euridice his wife presume To take the honour which to us belongs. O! they shall finde my fortune not so chang'd, But I am able yet to curbe their pride: What? what? Olympias must be reveng'd, And (save her selfe) no Queene she can abide. Exeunt. Chorus. Loe, how all good decayes, And ills doe now abound; “In this sky-compass'd round, “There is no kinde of trust: “For, man-kinde whilst it strayes “In pleasure-paved wayes, “With flouds of vice is drown'd; And doth (farre from refuge) In endlesse shadowes lodge, Yet strives to rise no more: “No doubt (as most unjust) “The world once perish must, And worse now to restore, Then it was of before, When at the last deluge, Men by Deucalion once Were made againe of stones; And well this wicked race Bewrayes a stony kinde, Which beares a stubborne minde, Still hardned unto sinne. Loe, now in every place All vertuous motions cease, And sacred faith we finde, Farre from the earth is fled, Whose flight huge mischiefe bred, And filles the world with warres, Whilst impious brests begin To let base Treason in: Which common concord marres, Whilst all men live at jarres, And nets of fraud doe spreade, The simple to surprise, Too witty, but not wise; Yet those who in deceit Their confidence repose, A thing more deare doe lose Then can by guile be gain'd; Which when repented late, May ruine once their state, Whilst purer sprites disclose With what their breasts are stor'd; For, though they would remord, They get not trust againe; But, having honour stain'd, And covenants prophan'd, Are held in high disdaine, “And doe in end remaine, “Of all the world abhorr'd; “Not trusty when they should, “Not trusted when they would: But ah! our Nobles now, Loe, like Lysander still, So that they get their will, Regard not by what way, And with a shamelesse brow, Doe of the end allow, Even though the meanes were ill; Which all the world may see, Disgraceth their degree, Who (changing every houre) Doe all base slights assay; What can brave mindes dismay, Whose worth is like a Tower, Against all fortunes pow'r, Still from all fraud whilst free? “These keepe their course unknowne, “Whom it would shame if showne: Who not from worth digresse, To slights which feare imparts, Doe shew heroicke hearts, The which would rather farre An open hate professe, Then basely it suppresse: “No glory comes from fearefull Arts: But those who doe us leade, As for dissembling made, Even though that they intend Amongst themselves to warre, Seeme in no sort to jarre, But friendship doe pretend, Not like their Lord now dead, Who trusting to his worth, Still what he meant spake forth; The great men not for nought, Doe seeke the peoples love: Their deeds that to approve, They may their mindes allure: But Perdiccas is thought, Too slowly to have sought Their doubtfull mindes to move, As one who still conceits He may command the fates; His pride so great is growne, That none can it endure; Yet stands his state unsure, Since odious to his owne: “He must be once o're-throwne, “Whose humour each man hates, “Pride doth her followers all, “Leade head-longs to a fall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 4. Scene 1. Antigonus, Eumenes. Though stormy discord, and tumultuous wars, Doe fire the mindes of men with flames of rage, That (hauing haughty thoughts, as heaven hath Starres) Their indignation nothing can asswage: Yet loe, amongst the Souldiers waving bowres, The Heraulds cryes doe calme the Trumpets sounds; And peace dare inter-pose unarmed pow'rs, To limit for a time Bellona's bounds; And (whilst of fury they suspend th' effects) The seeming-friended foes together treat, And every one shewes what his soule affects, Of peace a shadow: th' essence must be great. Thus men magnanimous amidst the field, Dare of their en'mies to the promise trust, And (loathing what disloyaltie doth yeeld) Not violate their vowes, nor prove unjust. “Though love be past, yet truth should still remaine, “I vertuous parts even in my foes applaud; “A gallant minde doth greater glory gaine, “To dye with honour, then to live by fraud; And why (Eumenes) as mistrusting me, Or standing on your reputation long, Did you disdaine to seeke (as all men see) A greater then your selfe, and one more strong? Eum. Though we come not to plead our birth-right here, Let him (for warriours so should take their place) In whom best signes of Noblenesse appeare, Be grac'd, as first who doth adorne a race; Most Noble he who still by vertue strives, To leave his name in mindes of men engrav'd, And to his off-spring greater glory gives, Then from his ancestors he hath receiv'd. Earst, we by birth in warre not marshal'd stood, As at the Table, upon Ivory beds; “A Souldiers worth consists not in his bloud, “But in their bloud which (as his foes) he sheds. What ever others of my linage try, I am Eumenes, and will not accord, That there can be a greater man then I, While as I have a heart, a hand, a sword. “Anti. Loe, when prosperity too much prevailes; “Above the judgement thus of vulgar mindes, “As little Barges burden'd with great Sayles, “They move in state, all swolne with fortunes windes; “And as adversity the sprite refines “From th'abject drosse of pride, and passions base, “That in affliction, vertue clearest shines, “And makes one all the wayes of wit to trace: “So doth good successe make the judgement dye, “Then whilst the fortunate their ease doe take, “And lull'd asleep in pleasures meadowes lye, “As for the slaughter fat, and ripe to shake; “Yet this the nature is of gallant men, “To rest (as in no state too much involv'd) “When prosp'ring warie, and most humble then, “If cross'd couragious, when imbark'd, resolv'd. What though your first attempts renowned are, By which you in two fields victorious stood, And did o're-throw two thunder-bolts of warre, Who lost their lives amid'st a crimson flood: Yet is that course of victory contrould, And you have try'd what force your force exceeds, Then, faded Lawrels should not make you bold, As still reposing on your by-past deeds: For, by the same to indignation mov'd, The Macedonians all abhorre your name, Who at that time so proud a Conquerour prov'd, Their great mens slaughter having wing'd your fame. Eum. No fortune past so puffes up my conceit, That it contempt of further danger brings; Nor am I now dejected so of late, But I intend to doe farre greater things. “He (by prosperity made never proud) “Who knowes the frailty of this earthly frame, “Can hardly by adversity be bow'd: “The Sunne (although eclips'd) remaines the same. “Worth should by th'events not be thrall'd to wit, “On th' accidents as th'essence did depend: “The fault of fortune cannot blemish it, “On which oft times disasters may attend; “Though fortune (stumbling right) concurre with worth, “Or yet, if crosses bragge a gallant minde, “Both like themselves are alwaies sparkling forth, “In every state some tokens of their kinde. Now at this time o're-match'd by num'rous pow'rs, I kept my courage, though I lost the field: And vaunt no more of this, for some few hour's May once to me the like advantage yeeld. Nor is it long since that to fortune deare, The world had never me but victor spy'd, Though I protest by all th'Immortals here, Press'd by necessity, not mov'd by pride. Proud Neoptolemus that traytour still, (Not worthy of a Macedonians name) He to betray the hoste, and me to kill, Had labour'd long to his eternall shame. But I of Craterus lament the fall, Whom for his vertue I did dearely love, And was constrain'd (I Iove to witnesse call) For my defence that refuge last to prove. Anti. How fortun'd you your forces to dispose, So well to scape that storme of threatned harmes? For, then you had to deale with mighty foes, Who were in warre growne hoarie under armes. Eum. When Neoptolemus did clearely spy, That all his treason to the light was brought, He, where our foes were camp'd, with haste did flye: “A foolish traitour who was false for nought. There he inform'd, or mis-inform'd my foes, That (by good successe growne secure of late) I in my Tent did carelesly repose, Though not by force, to be o're-com'd by fate. And to Antipater he further told, That Macedonians, if they at that time, Of Craterus the count'nance did behold, All willingly would yeeld themselves to him: Now they had labour'd earnestly before, That I abandon would Perdiccas part, And did protest that they would give me more Then yet I had, or hop'd for in my heart. “But love (born free) cannot be thrall'd nor bought, “More then a shamefull peace I like just strife; “To generous mindes more deare then honour nought; “And ere I leave my faith, I'le lose my life: Thus when despair'd that I would prove their friend, They sought in time to plague me as a foe, Where love could not begin, that hate might end, And came in haste to have surpris'd me so: But Neoptolemus to crosse by slight, The Macedonians I for him did bend, And Craterus concealing from their sight, To match with him, caus'd troupes of strangers tend. This policy which none could justly blame, I with my selfe in secret did conspire, And had my shirt beene privy to the same, It should have beene an offring to the fire. When deaths first game (with danger playd) was past, I Neoptolemus did toile to finde, And he me too, which happ'ned at the last; “Two will doe much to meet, when of one minde. Then whilst we met for whom both th'armies warr'd, Whose fortune did depend upon our hands, All was perform'd that force or fury dar'd, Whilst both were bent t' abate the others bands. And yet the heavens would not betray my trust, (“Foule treason never had a fairer end) But smil'd upon my cause (as which was just) And did destruction to the traitour send: For, forc'd by him whose force he did despise, (Though fighting fiercely long) he lost his breath, As one more strong then true, more stout then wise, Whose greatest honour, was his honest death. But weakened with huge wounds, almost I div'd In seas of bloud, even quite from knowledge stray'd; Yet by so great a victory reviv'd, My courage grew more then my strength decay'd. I (having finish'd thus this fatall strife) Did come where Craterus his course had runne, Even in the confines plac'd 'twixt death and life, The one neere gone, the other not begun: He with great valour had resisted long, As all Briareus hands had mov'd his sword, And did his Masters memory no wrong, Whilst with his courage, not his fortune stor'd. “What life refus'd, to gaine by death he thought: “For, life and death are but indifferent things, “And of themselves not to be shun'd, nor sought, “But for the good or ill that either brings. With endlesse glory bent to change his breath, Of desp'rate valour all the pow'r was prov'd, “And for great Captaines no more glorious death, “Then to dy fighting with a minde unmov'd. When it appear'd where victory did tend, That armies courage with their Captaine fell; And whilst I safely might be seene a friend, I went where death his Spirits did expell; And whilst I told how both to be betrayd, By Neoptolemus were brought about, My woe with teares I to the world bewray'd: “Milde pitty and true kindenesse must burst out. Ah, if the newes of this that I expresse Had come in time unto Perdiccas eares, He might have liv'd their pride now to represse, Who by his fall were first divorc'd from feares. Ant. The humour of that man was too well knowne, Could he have parted other men from pride, Whose soule was sold a slave unto his owne, And for the same (forc'd by his followers) dy'd? “Eum. The proud must still be plagu'd by prouder ones, “There must be had sharp steel to smooth rough stones, “Ant. No vice then pride doth greater hate procure, “Which foes doe scorne, and friends cannot endure. “Eum. Yet Majesty must not it selfe deject; “A lofty carriage doth procure respect. “Ant. A haughty gesture shewes a tyrants heart; “All love a courteous count'nance, voyd of Art. “Eum. Yet manners too submisse as much condemn'd, “Doe make Kings scorn'd, and Captains be contemn'd. “Ant. A humble port, kinde looks, words smooth and soft, “Are meanes by which great mindes may mount aloft. “Eum. Those are indeed for such as raise their flight, “They may doe more whose course is at the height: “Imperious formes an Empire must defend. Ant. Thus hastned was Perdiccas to his end. Eum. That worthy man had many faire designes, “But vertue still by envy is pursu'd, “Though (as a Candle in the night best shines) “It in a vitious age may best be view'd. There was a man who scorn'd secure delights, As still despising paine, attemptive, bold, A brave observer of the antient Rites, Steele strictly grasping, prodigall of gold; He lov'd to have the Souldiers of his band, Chus'd at the Musters, not in markets bought, And would not flatter where he might command; More meet to have, then seeke that which he sought; But Souldiers now in this degener'd age, Are (fawn'd on by faint mindes) brib'd in such sort, That all the reynes enlarg'd unto their rage, They with so straight a course cannot comport. What was mis-fortune knowne unto them all, Their malice as some great neglect did cite: “All things must helpe th' unhappy men to fall, Thus forth they spu'd the poyson of their spite, For, hating his franke forme, and naked words, By that occasion whetting their desires, They in his body boldly sheath'd their swords, A deed which even barbarity admires. Those trait'rous troups may spot the purest bands, If for a fact so vile they be excus'd: This will set swords in all our souldiers hands, Against us, and not for us, to be us'd. Ant. I wish that Souldiers never could be brought To prove so mut'nous as they oft have beene, And that they durst not violate in ought, Those who by them (as sacred) should be seene: Nor like I Captaines who (like blustring windes) Would o're their troupes insult (as tyrants still), Not weighing merits, nor respecting mindes, As carried head-long with a blinded will. “Pride by presumption bred (when at a height) “Encount'ring with contempt both match in ire, “And 'twixt them bring base cruelty to light, “The loath-some off-spring of a hated Syre. Such of Perdiccas was the monstrous pride, (The vice from which that vice more vile proceeds) That it strange wayes for his advancement try'd, And did burst forth in most prodigious deeds; At first by Meleagers death when stain'd, He show'd what tyrants harbour'd in his heart, To whom faith given, nor yet the Church he gain'd, (Though sacred both) no safety could impart. The Cappadocians (when all else was try'd) Choos'd (rather then his insolence to beare) By massacring themselves to scape from pride: “Pride, spight and horrour, death breeds onely feare. Yet what against his foes he did performe, From martiall mindes might plead for some excuse, Since irritated thoughts which (wrong'd) doe storme, In mindes offended, fury doe infuse: But yet why sought he in a servile sort, To play the tyrant, braving his best friends, Who with disdainefull formes could not comport? “More then an enemies yoke, a friends offends. And when of late by Ptolomie constrain'd, He brought his bands with disadvantage backe, How by the same his governement was stayn'd, The world can witnesse by his Armies wracke: “But hate made judge, each errour seemes a crime, “Whilst present ils doe aggravate things gone: His Souldiers mov'd by fortune and the Time, Did by his death venge all their wrongs in one. “Eum. As nought smels well to a distemper'd taste, “So to conceits pre-occupy'd before; “Even good seemes bad in them whom they detest: “Men must mislike where they can like no more. To you who loath'd Perdiccas and his state, What ever came of him could not seeme good: And I not wonder though your soule did hate One who had right and pow'r, to take your bloud: For, fled from him to whom you once belong'd, His Trumpet still breath'd terrour in your eare: “Then all men hate those whom they once have wrong'd, “And by no meanes can love them whom they feare. “Ant. That which you speake of hate, in love I spy, “Love cannot finde an imperfection forth, “But doth excuse, extenuate, or deny, “Faults (where it likes) with shadowes of no worth: I left Perdiccas, but did him no wrong, Who first to take my life, all meanes did prove; I told Antipater how he so long Had been abus'd by a pretended love: For, as I frankely love, whilst lov'd againe, If the ingrate, ingrately me acquite, Straight kindling fury with a just disdaine, I by love past, proportion then my spite; And yet (Eumenes) I commend thy minde, Who to defend thy friend, hast prov'd so free, And since in love so constantly inclin'd, A friendship firme I would contract with thee; Then where that now thy state hath been brought low, (Since spoil'd of him in whom thou did'st repose) Whilst ayded by our power, thou great maist grow, And raise thy hopes of kingdomes to dispose. Eum. I'le be your friend, whilst friend to right you rest: “For, without vertue, friendship is but vaine, “Which cannot lodge in a polluted brest, “Whose impious thoughts do sacred things prophane. While as the oath is kept, which once was sworne To Alexanders selfe, and to his race, Still shall this sword for your defence be borne, But in my heart they hold the highest place, And doe not thus, as o're one vanquish'd, vaunt, Nor thinke me thrall'd, though once by chance o'rethrowne, “The world must perish ere advent'rers want, “Who tosse all States to stablish once their owne. “Whil'st bravely taking or yet giving place, “How ever feare (objecting danger) comes, “Misfortune, bondage, torment, death, disgrace, “And all things else, a minde resolv'd o're-comes. Scene 2. Cassander, Lysimachus. “And must we buy our pompe at such a rate, “Who beare th'authority, or whom it beares? “O, O! how thorny are the wayes of State, “With open dangers pav'd, and secret feares; “Each of our steps is waited with some snare, “Whil'st from our selves we all repose repell, “And (in fraile Barks) press'd by tempestuous care, “Do seek a haven, whose heaven is but a hell. Lysim. “Whil'st Eolus and Neptune joyn'd in all, “With winds, and waves, beat th'earth, and brag the skies, “The tumbling Mountains do not rise and fall, “Though each of them another doth surprise: “As do th'aspiring pow'rs which are with doubt “Toss'd through the waving world on stormy Thrones, “And are (as in a Circle) hurl'd about, “Ascending, and descending, both at once. “Loe, some whose hopes would at their birth have seem'd, “By Fortunes strictnesse, with contempt confin'd, “Have from the vulgar yoke themselves redeem'd, “To do farre more then such durst have design'd, “And they who once might life to thousands give, “When some great period revolutions brings, “Brought downe even low cannot have leave to live, “Made lesse then Subjects, who were more then Kings. Cass. What once they scarce could dreame, some thus procur, Whose pow'r though nought at first, last, Scepters swayes; And some whose states seem'd once to be secure, Throwne from their Fortunes height lose glorious Bayes: My Father, loe, to gaine that soveraigne place, Through many dangers boldly march'd of late, And, then the greatest, greater for a space, Did manage all the Macedonian State: But I his Sonne who (as some would suppose) Might keep with ease, that which he got with paine, Can by no meanes my rest-lesse thoughts repose, Such raging Tyrants o're my fancies raigne. Lysim. And yet I thinke you have an easie part, To whom his State your Father did resigne, For, it may make you smile, which made him smart: “Some presse the grape, and others drinke the wine. Cass. Ile not beleeve that ever any ill Was bred for me within my Fathers brest, Since children must suppose their Parents will (Though seeming bad) still purpos'd for the best. And yet my Fathers Ghost must pardon me, Though when from us he minded to remove, I thinke the tenor of his last Decree, Show'd lack of judgement, or at least of love: For, what base course had ever beene begun To make me seeme not worthy of his place, That he preferr'd a Stranger to his Sonne, As bent to cloud the glory of his race? Thus since in such a sort he did neglect, The Sonne who should his name from death exempt, (As dis-regarded for some great defect) All other men may have me in contempt. But ere his age attain'd the fatall date, He saw my brows with lawrell boughs array'd, And spy'd my skill in warre, and wit in state, Which grew as much as his had then decay'd. Nor can my courage so be brought to bow, But Polypercon shall by proofe finde soone, That in my Fathers will, I will allow, Not what he did, but what he should have done; And since by him high dignities were wonne, I minde to prosecute what he began; “For (though I would) so great a Fathers Sonne “Can not securely live a private man. Loe, Polypercon by our pow'r repell'd From Macedonie hath retyr'd dismay'd, And for the feare of us hath beene compell'd To rest beholding for anothers aid. Let him not think that shadows (though of Kings) Can match my pow'r with these his borrow'd bands: A doubtfull flight all fram'd with others wings Will never beare him from Cassanders hands; And though Olympias count'nanc'd once his cause, As from Epirus come to ruine me: Now of her owne misfortune she must pause, Since brought of late unto a low degree. Lysim. And yet Olympias once did prosper well, When first she touch'd the Macedonian bounds, Whil'st Polypercon proudly did repell All those who durst resist with words, or wounds. Though Philip and Euridice his Queene, (To give them battell bent) in time arriv'd, The Macedonians when they had her seene, As their owne Queene to do her honour striv'd. And haplesse Philip whil'st constrain'd to yeeld, There, for a Kings did take a captives state: And with his mate (though flying from the field) Was follow'd by their force, and by her fate. Then did her husband and her selfe give place, Whose brows of late a Diademe had borne: But then throwne downe in depths of black disgrace, Were made of pride the prey, the butt of scorne. Cass. Those were the means which did them first entrap, But have you heard how after they were thrall, To plague the world with horrour, and mishap, The proud Olympias tyrraniz'd o're all? Lys. Some doubtfull rumors did frequent each Such as rash Fame confus'dly durst unfold: But yet by favour hid, or else for feare, The truth of all (it may be) was not told. Cass. When thus the Tygresse happ'ned to surprise Those wretched souls (as ravish'd in a dreame) Her heart at first seem'd scarce to trust her eyes, She surfetted her sight so with their shame; But when she saw (by reason of her pow'r) That she might safely let her rage burst out: She them about caus'd build a lightlesse Tower, Press'd by whose walls, they scarce could turne about; And in that dungeon (as entomb'd) they stood With high disgrace t'appease more high disdaines, Farre from all comfort, whil'st a little food Their life prolong'd, but to prolong their paines. “But for misfortune pity last doth pleade, “As envy doth prosperity oppose; The Macedonians (then indifferent made) On murmur'd rumours doubtfully did glose. The peoples grudge Olympias did perceive, And of just fury fearing the effect, She straight resolv'd lifes remnant to bereave, From weakened pow'rs which did no lesse expect. And when some Thracians basely bent for bloud (As she had charg'd) with mercenary spight, Had murdred Philip, and his Queene imbru'd With these red streames that drown'd her lifes delight. She sent to her whose soule in griefe did sinke, (As messengers of death to bragge her brest) A sword, a cord, and an empoyson'd drink, A Tyrants presents, yet a wretches best. Those seene, the Queene unmov'd this speech did make; (As one who had imbrac'd some great reliefe) Fit gifts for her to give, for me to take, Since she exceeds in hate, and I in griefe. And tell the Tyrant that I gladly dye, That once the angry gods to venge my death, May thunder forth that judgement, which I spie With bloud must choak that bloudy womans breath. Last, looking on her Lord who there lay slaine, Once partner of his joy, then, of his woe, Whil'st that his Roses did her Lillies staine, She kiss'd his wounds, as taking leave to goe; Lest Time her Resolution had betray'd, Her snowie necke (not us'd with such a chaine) Her girdle grasp'd; then dy'd no way dismai'd; And if she sigh'd, she sigh'd but for disdaine. Lysi. This barbarous act my breast with griefe doth sting; Can spight so much transport the meekest kinde? “And yet on th'earth there's no more cruell thing “Then malice raging in a womans minde? Cass. But yet this sacrifice could not asswage The boyling thoughts of her unbounded will: For, entring thus she rioted in rage, (As dogges that once get bloud, would alwayes kill) Each light occasion kindling still her wrath, The Soveraignty she shamefully abus'd; And put my brother Nicanor to death, Though for no crime condemn'd, no, not accus'd. To some (when dead) an hate by her was borne, Whose cruelty no floud of bloud confin'd: (Of Iolas the Tombe prophanely torne) She (robbing th'earth) with ashes stain'd the winde, To be Cassanders friend was such a crime, As none could scape who ever favour'd me; Thus huge disorders did abound a time: “Where laws not valued are, all things are free; When having heard of this outragious pride, Which made my native soyle contemn'd to be, I those indignities could not abide, Whose shame and danger did ayme most at me. So that at last (mov'd by my Countries care) (As much as by particular respects) I with great speed an Army did prepare To punish, or prevent the like effects. But when I was to Macedony come, To fortifie a Towne she did designe, Which I enclos'd, and quickly did o're-come, Whil'st famine forc'd the Fortresse to resigne. Then to necessity weake pride gave place, Her lofty courage was constrain'd to bow: So that she rests depending on our grace, To be dispos'd, as it shall please us now. Lysim. This chance the world to wonder may invite; Loe, there a Queene who had (though now distress'd) The rarest Fortune, and the greatest sprite That ever any of her sex possess'd. The widow'd Empresse who first bragg'd the Indes, Or proud Thomiris though both prais'd have beene, Or th'Amazons all borne with martiall mindes, Have never beene more stout then was this Queene; Her lifes first progresse did but prove too sweet, Whom once the world with treasures striv'd to blesse: But now sad soule (foil'd under Fortunes feet) Her misery no creature can expresse. Cass. Those were but Fortunes gifts which made her great, Whil'st treacherous shows by shallow wits were prais'd, Her imperfections did but staine the State, Where her not hers, but others merits rais'd: When first that Dame with famous Philip match'd, Her cunning carriage was not free from blame: But though she then with Argos eyes was watch'd, (As was suppos'd) soone forfeited her Fame; At least (shame-fear'd) he did her first disdaine, “And of that sexe the precious fame is such, “Their tender honour any breath may staine, “If tainted, foule; if but suspect'd, too much; Yet this at last did his destruction breed, For which her spightfull thoughts had labour'd long: She by Pausanias privy to his deed, Had spurr'd him to performe th'intended wrong; And by such meanes long sought, that to her will, Her husbands murder might enlarge the raynes, Whil'st back'd by power she boldly did the ill, Of which, too late, the troubled Realme complaines. Though loath'd of all (long suffred for her Sonne) She play'd the Tyrant safely as she pleas'd: But by the course that I have now begun, I hope those whom she plagu'd, shall be appeas'd. Lysim. Yet of Olympias (though cast downe by you) The sight her Sonne and Husband will revive, And so may make the Macedonians now, For her reliefe strange courses to contrive. “Of those whose greatnesse doth regard extort, “The miseries entender every minde, “And still th'affections of the vulgar sort, “Are (head-long led) too cruell, or too kinde. Cass. O! but I can precipitate her fall, Even by the meanes which might support her most: For, pity shall barre pity, whil'st they all Waile for their friends, who through her pride were lost. Lysim. “As those to whom all other things are free, “Must have their life and raigne both of one date, “So private men who passe their owne degree, “Can hardly turne to take their former state. “Your Fortune thus is trusted to the fates; “None can retyre who enters in such things: “All those who dare attempt against great States, “Must dye as Traitors, or else live as Kings; “And though you would but some disorders stay, “You deale with those who (borne not to be thrall) “As torrents beare away what stops their way, “And must of force (if not undone) do all. “Such (though set free) will storme when they are gone, “Who scorne to take the thing, that they should give; “All those must dye who dare but touch a Throne: “Who may endanger Kings, they must not live. Cass. Since in this course I onely once can erre, I shall be sure ere she her selfe with-draw. Lysim. And yet what surety can you have of her, “Can laws binde them who are above the law? “Who can a concord make betwixt the two, “Whereas the one must hate, the other feare? Cass. O, but I minde to use the matter so That both from hence shall further strife forbeare. Lysim. What can her freedome, and your peace procure? Cass. Death both can make her free, and me secure. Lysim. And would you do such ill to shed her bloud? Cass. Yea, ill to others, so it do me good. Lysim. The Macedonians will abhorre this wrong. Cass. And yet obey me if I be most strong. Lys. But who shall have the Realme amidst those broils? Cass. “Who ever winnes the field, doth owe the spoils. Lysim. So to possesse the Realme you have no right. Cass. But I have more, so long as I have might. Lysim. This State doth to it selfe an heire afford. Cass. “All kingdomes rights are pleaded by the Sword. Lysim. The people all will grudge against your state. Cass. But dare not stirre, whil'st feare exceeds their hate. Lysim. And in their hearts they will detest you too. Cass. Think what they will, who have no pow'r to doe. Lysim. What though Olympias in a little space May lose her pow'r, together with her breath? Yet there remaines another of her race, Who is by Nature bound to venge her death. Cass. “The raging streames of a tempestuous flood, “Which drowns the old, not yeelds the yong reliefe? “What foole who of his foes victorious stood, “Would spoyle an Army, and yet spare the chiefe: No, since I must my selfe with murder staine, Ile by the roots raze all the Royall race, So that no pow'r shall spring from thence againe, That may my selfe, or yet my plants displace. The strength hath left great Alexanders arme, Whose mothers fatall threed is now neere spunne; And I have meanes to keep my selfe from harme, Both of Roxane, and her tender Sonne. But since this course may much our states advance, By which a ground for great attempts is layd: I must entreat you now (what ever chance) To lend us your applause, though not your ayd. Lysim. I'le be your friend, yet wish you would refraine, From doing this; but, ere you be undone, Since by your guiltnesse I thus may gaine, Ile suffer that which I would not have done. Exeunt. Olympias alone. Can I be she whom all the world admir'd, As the most happie Queene that raign'd below, Whom all the Planets have to plague conspir'd, Of fickle Fortunes course the pow'r to show? No, no, not I, for what could me controull, Or force me thus t'attend anothers will, Since I despise this prison of my soule, Where it disdaines t'abide in bondage still? Ah! whil'st vaine pompe transported fancies fed, The jealous gods my state to grudge did tempt, My state which Envy once, and Reverence bred, Though now it breed but pity, and contempt: Olympias once high as Olympus stood, The wife of Philip, Alexanders Mother, Who match'd Alcides, and Achilles bloud, To breed a man more worth then both together. Am I the woman whose majesticke state Seem'd once so happy to deceiv'd conceits? I, I am she, and never yet more great Then at this present, even in spight of fates. A double bondage long did burden me, I to my selfe, my selfe to Fortune thrall: But now captivity hath set me free, Who could not rise till first I had a fall; “A sprit whil'st it prosperity benummes, “Scarce like the selfe can to the world appeare: “But then when vertue every crosse o're-comes, “True Greatnesse shines most bright in Glories spheare. “Our treasure now (I see) consists no more “Without our selves in th'eye-betraying shows, “But in the breasts inestimable store, “Which neither Time entombes, nor Pow'r o're-throws. O never were my thoughts enlarg'd till now To mark my selfe, and quintessence my minde: For, long (a prey to pride) I know not how, A mist of fancies made my judgement blinde. As those who dreame sweet dreames, whil'st wak't at last, Do finde their errour when their eyes finde light: Free from the slumb'ring of my Fortune past, I now arise to judge of all things right. “That cloud of pomp, whose smoak me shadow'd once, “Loe, now remov'd, unmasks my life too late: “And now I see, that Scepters, Crownes, and Thrones, “Are burd'nous badges of a dangerous state. O happie woman, of true pleasure sure, Who in the Countrey lead'st a guiltlesse life! From Fortunes reach retyr'd, obscure, secure, Though not a Queene, yet a contented wife. Thy Mate more deare to thee then is the light, (Though low in state) loves in a high degree, And with his presence still to blesse thy sight, Doth scorne great Courts whil'st he lives courting thee. And as thou wound'st him not with hid disgrace, He with no jealous thought doth rack thy brest: Thus both lye downe to rest, and rise in peace, Then (if they strive) they strive who should love best; What? though thou have not as the mighty ones, Thy neck surcharg'd with chains (ah chains indeed!) Nor eares weigh'd down with orientall stones, Nor Robes, whose worth may admiration breed; So want'st thou that which we have ever had, Sad mis-contentments, jealousie, and spite; And though thy back be not with purple clad, Thy thoughts are deck't with Innocencies white. As birds (whose cage of gold the sight deceives) Do seeme to sing, whil'st they but waile their state: So, with the mighty match'd, (made glorious slaves) We happy seeme, whil'st we but curse our fate. That blisse whose shew in us vaine eyes doth please, Makes thee indeed with pleasures spend thy breath, Who liv'st while yong in mirth, whil'st ag'd in ease, And know'st not what it is to dye till death; Ah! since I liv'd, I alwayes did but dye, When seeming happy, then most wretched still; Whil'st dazeling with vaine pompe each vulgar eye, What strange mishaps did me with anguish fill? The fates with fortune from my birth conspir'd To make my life, a patterne of their might: For both my parents from the world retir'd, When I had scarcely look'd upon the light: The world may judge how I was justly griev'd, Whil'st angry Philip sought for my disgrace, (A thing which once I scarce could have beleev'd) And unto Cleopatra gave my place. Then though I long (as desp'rate of reliefe) For his offence afflicted had my minde, Yet did his sudden death augment my griefe: He was my husband, though he was unkinde; And when my Sonnes rare deeds which fame doth sound, The world with wonder, ravish'd me with joy, Those (as himselfe) who would all his confound, To compasse me, did spite and power imploy; Yet stood my courage when my Fortune fell, And still I toil'd to persecute his foes, That some might fall downe who too much did swell, Their bloud in Marble registring my woes. That which I purpos'd, long so prosp'red too, That some of them did try (by torments strange) All what a womans just disdaine could do, Whil'st spurr'd by jealousie, spite, and revenge: But this Arch-traitour, Ruler of the rest, Who thirsts to drinke the bloud of all our Race, Even then, with us when all succeeded best, Did compasse me with ruine and disgrace. Such was the tenor of my Fortune past, Whose least mishap had made another burst, First, orphan'd, widow'd, and unchilded last, A daughter, wife, and mother, all accurst. Heavens plague Cassander, let that base wretch try That Iove his judgement but a while deferres; And let his wife bewaile as well as I, I murdred for my Sonne, and she by hers. Even as th'incestuous Thebans monstrous brood, So may thy Sonnes contend with mutuall wounds, And never let thy house be free from bloud, Till banish'd quite from this usurped bounds; Thus, notwithstanding of my wonted pow'r, To me (save wishes) nothing doth remaine: But though condemn'd to dye, yet at this houre Should I begin to curse, and to complaine? No, no, that custome best becomes poore soules, Whose resolution cannot climbe more high; But I whose courage that base course controuls, Must triumph still what ever State I try. “Death is the port where all may refuge finde, “The end of labour, entry unto rest; “Death hath the bounds of misery confin'd, “Whose Sanctuary shrowds affliction best. “To suffer (oft) with a couragious heart, “It doth deserve more praise then deeds most knowne: “For, in our actions Fortune hath some part, “But in our suffrings, all things are our owne: Loe, now I loath the world, and worldly things, Of which I both have prov'd the best and worst: The apprehended death great comfort brings, And hath no crosse, but that it should be forc'd. O heare me now (deare Sonne) if that thy Ghost May leave th'Elysian fields to look on me: Of all things else this doth content me most, That from this time I may remaine with thee. And blush not now to see thy Mothers end, My death in glory with thy life shall strive: It (as a captive) Fortune shall attend, That (as thy fellow) follow'd thee alive. Exit. Chorus. Ah, ah! though man the image of great Iove, And, th'onely creature that gives Reason place, With reverence due unto the powres above, His heavenly progeny should seeke to prove, By still resembling the Immortall kinde; Yet makes the world our better part so blinde, That we the clouds of vanity imbrace, And from our first excellency decline; This doth distinguish that celestiall grace, Which should make soules to burne with Vertues love, Whose fancies vice luxuriously new feasts; “Vice is the Circe that enchants the minde, “And doth transforme her followers all in Swine; “Whilst poyson'd pleasures so corrupt our tastes, “That of halfe-gods, we make our selves whole-beasts: And yet of ruthlesse Pluto's raging host, The vice which doth transport presumptuous hearts, And makes men from the Gods to differ most, Is cruelty, that to the sufferers cost, And actors both, is often-times appeas'd: The gods delight to give, and to forgive, By pardoning, and not by plagueing pleas'd; And why should men excogitate strange Arts, To shew their tyranny, as those who strive To feed on mischiefe, though the Author smarts, Oft for the deed of which himselfe did boast, Whil'st whence the blow first came, the griefe doth turne? “For, that by which the minde at first was eas'd, “May it in th'end the greatest burden give; “Oft those whose cruelty makes many mourne, “Do by the fires which they first kindled burne; “Of other tyrants which oppresse the minde, “With pleasure some delight it, in such sort “That first the hony, then the gall we finde; “And others (though from Honors Court declin'd) “Some comfort yeeld (but base) by hope of gaine; “And, though some make us to be loath'd of one, “We by their meanes anothers love obtaine; “But cruelty, with which none can comport, “Makes th' authors hated when the deed is done, “Oft even by those whom it did most support, “As that which alienates men from their kinde; “And as humanity the minde enchaunts, “So barbarous soules which from the same refraine, “More fierce than savage beasts, are lov'd of none: “Since with such beasts one with lesse danger haunts, “Then with the man whose minde all mercy wants; Yet though the minde of man, as strong, and rude, Be ravish'd oft with violent desire, And must, if fir'd with rage, be quench'd with bloud, How can this tender sexe whose glory stood In having hearts inclin'd to pity still It selfe delight in any barbarous deed? For, Nature seemes in this to use her skill, In making womens mindes (though weake) entire, That weaknesse might, love, and devotion breed; To which their thoughts (if pure) might best aspire; As aptest for th'impressions of all good, But from the best to worst all things do weare; Since cruelties from feeble mindes proceed, “In breasts where courage failes, spite, shame and feare “Make envy, hate, and rigour rule to beare. Our Queene Olympias, who was once so great, And did such monstrous cruelties commit, In plaguing Philip, and his Queene of late, Loe, now brought low to taste the like estate, Must take such entertainment as she gave, And yet good reason that it should be so, “Such measure as we give, we must receive. Whil'st on a Throne she proudly earst did sit, And with disdainefull eyes look'd on her foe, As onely vanquish'd by her pow'r, and wit, She did not weigh what doth proceed from fate: O, O! th'Immortals which command above, Of every state in hand the Rudder have, And as they like, can make us stay or go; “The griefe of others should us greatly move, “As those who sometime may like Fortune prove; “But as experience with rare proofes hath showne, “To look on others, we have Linx his eyes, “Whil'st we would have their imperfections knowne; “Yet (like blinde Moles) can never marke our owne. “Such clouds of selfe-regard do dimme our sight; “Why should we be puff'd up when foes do fall? “Since what to day doth on another light, “The same to morrow may our state surprise. “Those that on this inconstant constant Ball “Do live environ'd with th'all-circling skies, “Have many meanes whereby to be o're-throwne: “And why should dying worldlings swolne with wrath, “So tyrannize o're an afflicted wight, “Since miseries are common unto all? “Let none be proud who draw a doubtfull breath, “Good hap attends but few, unto their death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. Scene 1. Aristotle, Phocion. Log have I us'd that light which cleares my minde, On Natures labours curiously to look, And (of all creatures finding out the kinde) Have read strange wonders in the worlds great book: I mark her course by contraries maintain'd, Whose harmony doth most subsist by strife, And of all creatures in the same contain'd, How various is the mystery of life? But as all things are subject unto change, Which partners are of th'elementall pow'rs, So (roll'd about with revolutions strange) “The state of man rests constant scarce for houres. “Loe, what doth fame more frequently report, “Then sudden risings, and more sudden falls? “I thinke the world is but a Tenis-court, “Where Fortune doth play States, tosse men for Balls. Pho. And never any age show'd more then this, The wavering state of soule-ennobled wights, Who soare too high to catch an aiery blisse, Whil'st lowest falls attend the highest flights. That matchlesse Monarch who was borne (it seem'd) To shew how high mortality attaines, Hath not from death th'adored flesh redeem'd; But paine hath made an end of all his paines. And those brave bands which furnish'd Fame with breath, Whil'st all the world their valorous deeds did spie, Rest now (confounded since their Soveraignes death) Like Polyphemus having lost his eye. And they are like that teeth-ingendred brood, Which took their life out of a Monster dead, Whil'st each of them would drinke the others bloud, Since that great Dragons death who was their head. Ar. “So change all things which subject are to sight: “Disorder order breeds, and order, it: “Next light comes darknesse, and next darknesse light, “This never-changing change transcends our wit. “Thus health and sicknesse, poverty and state, “Dishonour, honour, life and death, with doubt, “Still inter-changing (what a true deceit!) “All link'd together, slide by turnes about; “To worldly states the heavens a height appoint, “Where, when they once arrive, they must descend, “And all perfections have a fatall point, “At which Excellency it selfe must end. “But as all those who walke on th'earth, are cross'd “With alterations, happ'ning oft, and strange, “The greatest States with greatest stormes are toss'd, “And (sought of many) must make many a change. Nor speake I this by speculation mov'd, (As gathering credit out of ancient scroules) “No, I have liv'd at Court, and oft have prov'd “Nothing below more vex'd, then great mens Soules; “The Tyrant honours thralls, while as they mone, “Their plaints to vulgar eares loath to impart, “They all the weight of woes must beare alone, “Where others of their griefe lend friends apart. “Their verie rising o're us to the height, “Which seemes their best is worst, for, being Lords; “They never know the truth that comes to light, “When franke society speakes naked words. “Whilst sadnesse oft seemes Majestie, Time tels “How deare they buy their pompe with losse of rest: “Some but three furies faine in all the hels; “There are three thousand in one great mans brest. Phoc. I thinke all Monarchies are like the Moone, Which now eclips'd, now under cloud, now cleare, Growes by degrees, and is (when full) undone: Yet Æson-like renew'd doth re-appeare: For, loe they first, but small beginne to shine, And when they once their Spherick forme obtaine, Doe coldly languish, and (till chang'd) decline, Yet (falne) in other realmes doe rise againe. Assyria once made many nations bow, Then next, all power was in the Persians hand, And Macedonians last (grown Monarchs now) Amongst themselves divided cannot stand. Ar. “A secret fate (alternatly) all things “Doth in this circle circularly leade: “Still generation from corruption springs, “That some may live, of force some must be dead; “Each Element anothers strength devours; “Th'aire to the fire succumbes, the fire to raine, “The waters strive to drowne the Earth with showres, “Which it by vapours vomits out againe; “Thus (with a Gordian knot together bound) “All things are made, un-made, and made againe: “Whilst ruine founds, perfection doth confound: “Free from some change no State can long remaine; “But what in th'earth more dangerously stands “Then Soveraignty (though rated at such worth) “Which like the stormy Gods tumultuous bands, “Doth flie from th'East to West, from South to North? Phoc. A long experience now makes this not strange, That mighty States whose reines one only leades, Be oft distracted, and constrain'd to change, As too great bodies for so little heads, Since every common-wealth (where all mens wits Doe joyne in one to breed the publike ease) Hath many fevers and pestiferous fits, Which physick oft, oft poison must appease: For (ah) the multitude more rash then wise, A Hydra-headed beast which humor blindes; Doth passionately praise, or else despise, As some prepost'rous fancies move their minds; “From vice and vertue oft like danger flowes; “Whilst th'one breeds envie, and the other hate: “As jealousie, or emulation growes, “Those oft are crush'd who doe support a state. Ar. “Whilst some their betters, others equals scorne; “The popular authority decayes, “And when it dies the Monarchie is borne, “Whose violence disorders fury staies; “The raines of state it with most ease doth swaie, “Of power (as joyn'd in one) the strongest kind: “Still whilst it (humbly high) doth hold a way “Twixt tyrannie and too remisse a minde; “But though States rul'd by one, may flourish long; “Whilst one can well command, and all obey, “Whilst guerdon goodnesse, vengeance followes wrong, “That (vertue cherish'd) vice is made decay: “Yet (if nought else) Time doth great States orecome: “And all are bounded by some fatall houre; “What mis-adventures many wayes may come “To dissipate the most united pow'r? “O! huge mishaps a Monarchie may marre, “When prosp'rous Times doe (forc'd by fates) expire, “To further which oft strangers must make warre, “And mut'nous subjects som-time may conspire? “As jealous feare (when brav'd by danger) moves, “All princes would suppresse aspirers still: “And then a subjects course most dangerous proves, “When either feare, or hope transports his will. “But though that first to rise, last to descend, “Great States are guided by a secret fate: “Yet, still the cause which doth forgoe their end, “Springs from contempt, or is enforc'd by hate; “The first in kings the lack of courage breeds, “Encouraging Ambition to rebell; “The other doth attend tyrannicke deeds, “That violence may violence repell. Phoc. “Yet never did so many Monarchs fall “By forraine battells, nor by civill broiles, “As by themselves who (seeming free) were thrall, “Whilst smooth-tongu'd Minions gloried of their spoils. “Those who have raign'd by choice, by birth, or worth, “Or did encroach on Crownes by chance, or crime, “Oft suffer vices to burst freely forth, “Which vertues colours guilded till that time. “Men clearely show what harbours in their brest, “Whilst (Envies object) free from any feare: “That which is eminent is marked best, “And highest fortunes hardest are to beare. “Low States to censure Criticks doe despise, “Whilst oft grosse faults for vertues fame esteemes, “The stupid, patient, and the fearefull wise, “Will, constancie, and softnesse goodnesse seemes. “But on the Stage of State when one must stand “A publike Actor plac'd in all mens sight; “And (swaying pow'r) with an imperious hand. “Doth hold the ballance both of wrong and right, “Then, he for every action that is his “The censure of a thousand tongues must have, “Not onely damn'd for doing things amisse, “But for not doing all that all men crave; “That Prince but undermines the Soveraigne seate, “Who cares not who be weak so he be strong, “More studious for himselfe then for the state, “Or (if for it) that he may hold it long: “For, where Iove him for all mens good ordaines, “He thinkes both them, and theirs, made him to please, “As if a charge of weight, a place of paines “Were but a bed of rest, a Heaven of ease. “The worlds great weight which Atlas shoulders beare, “Is not so weighty all to weigh one downe, “As that which on his head a king doth weare: “No burdens charge more heavie then a crowne. “Th'ægean waves Time may more soone appease, “Then restlesse thoughts whose course for state prepares: “Can they have rest who toile for all mens ease? “The purple ever must be lin'd with cares. Ar. “Good kings are like the fire which (flaming bright) “Doth waste it selfe to serve anothers turne: “And soveraignty is like fires glancing light, “Which (if but view'd) delights, if touch'd, doth burne; “I like for warmenesse to stand Vulcan by, “But not to burne amid'st the Lemnian flame: “In Cedars shadowes men more safely lie, “Then on their tops, the roaring deities game: “All th'eie-attracting pompe and glorious showes, “Do merit scorne, though they amazement breed: “The world them pittie more then Envie owes, “Who to seeme happy wretched are indeed. “What alterations strange attend a Throne, “As if the spheare of fortune were a crowne? “The great still toss'd like Sysiphus his stone, “When rais'd most high, rest ready to fall downe. Of this what greater proofe can fame afford Then mighty Philips memorable fall, Who daunted had the Grecians by the sword, Though till that time by strangers not made thrall? He, he, then whilst he solemniz'd with state, His daughters marriage, suddenly was lost: It seem'd when Heaven that Monarchs daies would date, That Hymens torch gave light to Pluto's post. When strong regards had grav'd within my heart, The miseries that proper were to Court, I thought them happie who (retir'd apart) Could never know such things, but by report. I might have liv'd with Alexander still, To vertuous men, whose favours were not scarce: Yet rather choos'd (though having both at will) To serve with Pallas, then command with Mars. And whilst he toil'd of others Lord to be, I of my selfe did labour to be Lord; Yet made as great a conquest too as he; My pen shall be as famous as his Sword. Phoc. And had I willingly engag'd my rest, The way to trace which to vaine glory tends, I might have liv'd (respected with the best) A speciall one of Alexanders friends. Though I of him did never merit ought, He entertain'd my friendship till his death, And when he once our Citties o'rethrow sought, At my request did pacifie his wrath. Then once to me a masse of gold he sent, And offred too a stately Asian Towne, Which I refus'd, more pleas'd with my poore rent, Then he with all the treasures of a Crowne: I told, that such a summe but serv'd to make Him a corrupter, me corrupted thought, And foule for him to give, for me to take, If us'd, sham'd both, unus'd, did serve for nought; But all those baites I never daign'd to touch, Least I (who all my life had liv'd so free) Might be possess'd too much, possessing much, If taking Riches, it had taken me. No, I would rather learne to live with lesse, Then for superfluous furniture to strive: “Who seekes out substance but to nurse excesse, “To use it lives, not it that he may live. “My fortune doth afford sufficient meanes, “That may preserve all natures pow'rs in force; “And he who on a golden Scepter leanes, “Can not have more, but may well use it worse. “Then since aboundance, but abuses brings, “Why seeke men more then how to be well eas'd? “And (ah!) why toile they for so many things, “Since with a little nature can be pleas'd? Ar. Loe! how the Heavens, whose love to man exceeds, Have made his body strong, his minde divine, And have made th'earth to furnish all his needs, Least curbing Cares might make his thoughts decline: So that he hath a meanes to raise his flight (If wing'd with vertue) and may (mounting hie) By time approach to the celestiall light, And deifie himselfe before he die, Yet doth he straight forgoe that glorious way, To toile for things which th'earth not forc'd affords, The which his wants first fram'd were to defray, But by himselfe are of his life made Lords. “O! how unworthie of the worth of man, “Are many labours which delight him most, “Since that corruption boldly first beganne “To make men nurse vile vice at vertues cost. And now what hath great Alexander gain'd By endlesse travell, and excessive cares? (Of whom (loe) now, they onely say he raign'd) But death vnto himselfe, worse to his heires. And for the guiltlesse blood which he hath spill'd, His conquests partners (loe) doe now beginne To die even by the swords by which they kill'd, And all his off-spring expiates his sinne. Phoc. “Strange revolutions sway all worldly things: “The wheele of fortune still must slipperie prove, “And chiefely then when charg'd it is with kings, “Whose states (as weighty) quickly make it move. Yet Alexander I must say was blest, Who (still a victor) from distresse estrang'd The worlds chiefe Monarch when his state was best, Did die in time before his fortune chang'd: And for his favour which I oft did try, Whom earnestly he labour'd to advance; It grieves me that himselfe so soone did die, And that his off-spring hath so hard a chance. His Successors have set all Greece on fire, Of which I feare to perish by some sparke; For, Polypercon doth my death conspire, “And who can scape when made a great mans marke? Yet for my Countries cause I'le give my blood, “Whilst safely prais'd all follow vertue can, “But (when by danger bragg'd) then, to doe good, “O! that is worthie of a worthie man. Nor doe I tender so this puffe of breath, But I can yeeld that Nature it expell: “A minde that is resolv'd, triumphes o're death, “He hath liv'd long enough who hath liv'd well. Exeunt Scene 2. Cassander, Lysimachus, Ptolomie, Seleucus. No doubt (great Heroes) whom the Heavens have lov'd, (What ever count'nance duty doth pretend) Your minds are glad, since those (by me remov'd) Who might have made you end, have made an end. Loath not the meanes if pleas'd with the effect, For though by this I have a realme obtain'd, It yeelds you more, whose course none can suspect: I onely guilty am, ye all have gain'd. Yet to pursue my life they first began, For my defence this refuge last I prov'd: “What then himselfe can be more neere to man? “When bragg'd by danger who would not be mov'd? And if Olympias had not di'd in time By offring up her blood to worke my peace, Then mine had beene the harme, and hers the crime, I but prevented her a little space; And if her off-spring had surviv'd her death, Whose rising could not but procure our fall, Yee, now who nought but soveraignty doe breath, Had breath'd obedience, or not breath'd at all. Lysim. You from a dangerous yaoke have us releev'd, Which (I suspect) we should have tri'd too soone: “And why then should we labour to seeme griev'd “At that thing done, which we wish not undone? No, no, since all for soveraignty do strive, And have once tasted what it is to raigne, Each one of vs would rather die, then live To beare a subjects servile yoke againe. And though perchance with Alexanders Sonne; (If heire to him in worth, as of his state) We might have most respected places wonne, As speciall pillars of the Princes seate. “Though greater then the rest, as of before, “It would have vex'd us, lesse then one to fall: “The fall from first to second grieves one more, “Then from the second to the last of all; Our envi'd glory had destruction brought, And would have made us odious to remaine: “It dangerous is for subiects to be thought “Such as desire, or yet deserve to raigne. When any Tempest threatned had his Throne, He would have sought for surety at our cost: “When Iealousie (mindes worme) hath seaz'd on one, “The greatest vertues are suspected most. “Yea, though we could to quite our state consent, “Us from suspition nought but death could purge: “Still greatnesse must turmoile, or then torment, “If borne a burthen, if layd downe a scourge. Ptol. But when we have within our bosome weigh'd The ruine of all Alexanders race, Whom without blushing we might have obey'd, By right succeeding in our Soveraignes place. How can our soules but highly be asham'd, If one below them farre emboldned thus, Doth seeke by wrong that which by right they claim'd, And by their o'rethrow would insult o're us? Nor neede I more as in suspense remaine, To maske my meaning with ambiguous wordes, No, no, our words may as his deeds be plaine, Which fame (and that not whis'pring) now records. Ye heare how that Antigonus of late, (Whose thoughts (wing'd with good succes) soare too high Doth strive above the rest to raise his State, And by all meanes doth fortune frankely ply. Since to his hands Eumenes was betrai'd, Loe quite transported by præpost'rous pride, (As if in nought adebted to our ayde) To yeeld our due he cannot now abide. Lysim. “Thus time the truth of all things doth proclame: “Man is a crafty Creature, hard to know, “Who can a face for every fortune frame: “No trust in mortalls, no; nor faith below, “As our particulars doe sometime move, “We, what we wish for most, seeme to mislike, “And oft of others doe the course disprove, “Whilst we want only meanes to doe the like. Then whilst Perdiccas did attempt before To make the rest who were his equalls thrall, Who, then Antigonus detested more The foolish pride of one that would have all? But since Perdiccas and his faction fell, Whom he (as Traitours to the State) pursu'd, He, in his place succeeding to rebell, Hath what he seem'd to end, againe renew'd; And yet I many times have mus'd of this, How from the world he did Eumenes send. Sel. How? but by Treason as his custome is, False at the first, and cruell in the end. Lysim. I know, that after many doubtfull fights, He hath o'rethrowne Eumenes at the last: But by what Stratagems, or treach'rous slights, I would be glad to heare how all hath past. Sel. Antigonus was at the first afrai'd, To match Eumenes by plaine force in fight, And therefore all that feare affords assai'd, For valour franke, still using warie slight. Amongst Eumenes troupes (their mindes to prove) He scattred letters with allurements stor'd, By promis'd treasures, and protested love, Some to corrupt who might betray their Lord; But he (still wise) his Troupes in time advis'd To cleare their vertue by their enemies vice, And gave them thankes, who would not be entis'd To sell their faith at such a bloodie price; Then said, that he himselfe those scroules procur'd, That when they spy'd such practises againe, They still might thinke them (by this meanes allur'd) Their Captaines triall, not their Enemies traine. Thus by the course which should have him entrap'd, His adversarie did deluded stay: Whilst both he from that present danger scap'd, And to prevent the like, prepar'd a way. Then when he saw this policy had fail'd, And that there had some doubtfull conflicts past, Antigonus who had at one prevail'd (As having had some vantage at the last) Did with Eumenes straight procure to speake, And (as t'one vanquish'd) offred him good-will, But he (whose minde could not be brought to breake) Would onely talke as to his equall still: For, when a band (betweene them made) did beare, He to Antigonus should helpe impart, That forme reform'd he first of all would sweare, With Alexanders off-spring to take part. Thus where they his submission did attend, Imperiously conditions he impos'd: So that thereafter to procure his end, The other by all meanes his minde dispos'd; And shortly of his bands a vaine debate, For his confusion fit occasion brought; “Still as by concord small things doe grow great, “By discord great things are reduc'd to nought; While-as Eumenes fortunately liv'd, The Agiraspides to him gave place, Till that for state two of their Captaines striv'd, And his authoritie would not embrace. Such was that spite of theirs to have him spoil'd, That though of valour he rare wonders prov'd, And oft by force Antigonus had foil'd, Yet from their mind it could not be remov'd For (by their meanes allur'd) the other bands, To get some baggage which they lost againe, Did take their Captaine, with outragious hands, Their glory darkning by that odious stayne: And though Eumenes trusting to new hopes, By flying labour'd succour to have found, He was prevented by his Trait'rous Troupes, And (like to some base fugitive) was bound. Scarce could his stormy stomack bent to breake, Daigne to entreat those who had him betrai'd, Yet, hauing hardly purchas'd leave to speake, He stretch'd them forth his fettred hands, and sayd: Loe, what apparell now your Generall weares, Since with your faith his libertie was lost; Yet he those bands not given by th'enemie beares; No, but by you in whom he trusted most: And must he thus be led, who should you lead? Is this the triumph which I should receave For all my victories, thus to be made Of Captaine, Captive; of a Conquerour, slave. How oft (my Souldiers) have yee all of late To me by solemne oathes sworne to be true? “But it becomes none in a captives state “With loftie words his keepers to pursue; Nor crave I further favour at this houre, Then that ye bath your weapons in my brest; Let not my life be in mine enemies pow'r, Loe all that your Commander doth request. I know Antigonus doth take no care Who get my bodie, so he get my head; And he regards not, neither when, nor where, Nor in what sort I die, so I be dead. But if through horrour of so vile a deed Your eyes looke downe, your haire erected stands, Which in your mindes this much remorse doth breed, That as your hearts ye will not staine your hands; Then as your Captaine, since not force I may, I (as your friend) entreate, that now in time I may but have a Sword my selfe to slay, You to excuse, whilst partner of your crime. But when he saw that words could not asswage Their barb'rous thoughts which nothing could controule, Then having turn'd his Courage all in rage, He thus flam'd forth the fury of his soule: O damned rascalls who have lost all faith, Whom neither duty, nor yet merit bindes! How oft was Alexander mov'd to wrath By those your mut'nous and malitious mindes. And, O! what could I at those hands attend, Which yet were smoaking with Perdiccas blood? Of those who by like Treason did intend With old Antipaters to be imbru'd. Heaven thunder on you from th'ætheriall Rounds, And make you live (abominable band) Base vagabonds, barr'd from your native bounds, Then die detested in a barb'rous Land; And as ye have the world with murder fill'd, So may your blood by the same Swords be shed, By which you have moe of your Captaines kill'd Then of your foes, from whom (like beasts) ye fled. But neither courteous, nor outragious words Could change his souldiers from their first intent; Who forward led their Captaine chain'd with cords, (A scorned Captive) to his Rivals Tent, Where to the end that he might quickly end, He ask'd, what stay'd Antigonus to goe By setting of him free to gaine a friend, Or by his death to rid him of a foe; And soone Antigonus did hast his fall, By this great magnanimity not mov'd; And th' Agiraspides (dispers'd o're all) As murderers, murder from the world remov'd. “Thus oft have Traitours beene dispatch'd in time, “By those whom their upbraiding lookes dismay: “That loath'd remembrance of the Authors crime “The actors death can onely wipe away. Now claimes Antigonus when fame doth feast, Above his Soveraignes selfe in ranke to sit; For Alexander but subdu'd the East, And he hath conquer'd them who conquer'd it. Cass. No doubt, but he will doe the best he can, And hath within himselfe high things design'd: “For whilst prosperity transports a man, “Nought seemes difficult to a loftie minde. Sel. Of those in whom he did suspect a sprite, Whose courage serv'd his courses to resist, He hath himselfe by diverse meanes made quite: In others wreakes his safety doth consist; Thus martiall Pithon who no danger spar'd, (Whom Alexander held in high account) Did at the last receave a hard reward, For helping him Eumenes to surmount. His sprite to tempt, and power fit to performe Made jealousie Antigonus torment; And yet he fain'd to love him for the forme, Till he his Court did move him to frequent, Where whilst he did (mistrusting nought) abide, He publikely in all the peoples sight (Though seeming justly) damn'd unjustly di'd: “No wrong more vile then wrong that lookes like right. Thus divers Governours within short space, Their Government, or then their life have lost, And others are preferr'd unto their place, Who did depend upon his favour most; Oft likewise me he labour'd to surprise, By policy whom he would have o'rethrowne: But I, whom Pythons danger had made wise, Learn'd by his ruine to prevent mine owne; To save my life abandon'd is my state, And I have fled with danger as you see: That you may know, how that man doth grow great, Whose pride may plague you all, as well as me. Cass. Then let us see what course we should intend, Least (out of time made wise) we rue too late. Lysim. “I rather first pursue, then last defend. Ptol. “A fire would still be quench'd ere it grow great. Cass. Then let us from Antigonus in haste Demand our share of what he did attaine; Since in this warre we did our Treasure waste, We should be likewise partners of the gaine: But if against our suite his eares he barre, And doe with scornefull words contemne our claime, Then may our messenger denounce the warre, And we shall shortly prosecute the same. Ptol. A mutuall band must made amongst us be, To make one fortune common to us all, And from hence-forth we must all foure agree To stand together, or together fall. And since the Princely buds for which we car'd, (How ever dead) are dead, what ere we doe, So to procure from men the more regard, We with the state must take the title too. And we must both be crown'd, and knowne for kings, “The diadem of Greatnesse is the Tower: “All vulgar judgements leane on th'outward things, “And reverence State, where they obey but pow'r. Exeunt. Nuntius, Philastrus, Chorus. Is there a Heaven? and are there Heavenly Pow'rs To whose decree terrestriall things are thrall? Or would the Tyrant that begets the houres, (Eternity not spar'd) extinguish all? Loe, Nature travels now, as big with change, Since mortals all humanity have lost, And in th'old Chaos, or some masse more strange To leave their essence all things earthly boast. Can reasonable soules (from reason barr'd) Even strive which most in cruelty exceeds? What eye hath seene? or yet what eare hath heard Such monstrous chances, and prodigious deedes? Th'Arabian Robbers, nor the Scythians wild, With savage beasts, which doe (as barbarous) haunt With such foule facts have not themselves defil'd, As those who of civility doe vaunt. Since Greekes (growne barbarous) basely are inclin'd, All vertue vanish'd is, all good forgot. O carelesse Heavens! wretch'd Earth! Cho. what loads thy minde? Nun. A multitude of murders. Cho. what? Nun. what not? Cho. We know that since our Soveraigne lost his breath, Th'earth hath beene bath'd with many a crimson flood; Perdiccas did procure Meleagers death, And his owne Souldiers drown'd his breath with blood, Th'Athenians prey Leonatus did remaine, And (by Eumenes subtiltie dismai'd) Neoptolemus and Craterus were slaine, Then by his owne Eumenes was betrai'd. Phil. “Man with his skill against his knowledge strives, “Where death his way attends, that way he tends, “And t' Atropos the fatall razor gives, “To cut the threed on which his life depends. “When Asia's victor after all his warres, Great Babylon to view had bent his mind, Both I, and others, studious of the Starres, Did shew that there his ruine was design'd; And to his successors we oft have showne The meanes by which their fate might be controul'd, Yet was our skill contemn'd, and they o'rethrowne, As we fore-told, and as they now have told. Nun. They have told much, and yet I must tell more, Their newes were evill, yet were they not the worst. Cho. And have the Heaven reserv'd more plagues in store? As if we yet were not enough accurst. Nun. “As th'earth in pride, the Heavens in plagues abounds; Our highest hopes have perish'd but of late. Cho. Then wound our eares by hearing others wounds, That pittie now may tread the steps of hate. Nun. Our Queene Olympias (raging with revenge) All Macedonie did with murders fill, Which from her part the people did estrange, Whilst rigor onely limited her will. So that when fierce Cassander sought her wreake, She did mistrust the Macedonians mindes, And for the time the nearest strength did take, There, till the storme was past, to waite faire winds. But soone Cassander did the Towne enclose, And as she held him out, did hold her in, That (like a Captive guarded by her foes) She knew not by what way a way to winne, And when lives scant provision did decay, Then did bare walles but small refuge afford: “She Scylla scap'd to be Charybdis prey, “Who fell on famine flying from the sword. Straight like pale Ghosts, faint Souldiers did remaine, Whose bowels hunger like a Harpie teares, And with couragious words, the Queene in vaine Did raise their sprite (the belly hath no eares) All languishing did then begin to fade, As if too weake to beare themselves about. Legges fail'd the body, and the necke the head, Then whilst the flesh fell in, bones bursted out; And when that meates which common are were spent, Then Horses, Dogs, Cats, Rats, all serv'd for food, Of which, no horrour th'eaters did torment, For what not poyson was, all then seem'd good: Some mouthes accustom'd once with dainty meates, Wish'd what they oft had loath'd, vile crums, foule flouds, And Ladies which had liv'd in pompous states, Fed, as brought up with wolves amidst the woods. Yea, nurst by those whom they themselves had nurst, Oft by the off-springs death the Parent liv'd: And which was worst, whilst brests were like to burst, None could give comfort, all themselves were griev'd. Such was their state, no friend bewail'd his friend, No wife her husband, no, nor Syre his sonne; For apprehending their approaching end, All with compassion of themselves were wonne. The dead mens smell empoyson'd them who liv'd, Whilst first made faint by a defrauded wombe; Heapes were of breath and buriall both depriv'd, That all the towne in end was but a tombe. Cho. Life is the subject of distresse and griefe, “That still affords us matter to bemone; “And we by death can onely have reliefe: “To live, and to be wretch'd, are both but one. “Yet foolish worldlings toss'd with endlesse care, “(Though at too deare a rate) would still buy breath, “And following feathers wavering through the ayre, “Love life (though wretch'd) more then a happy death. Nun. When thus the world Olympias plagu'd did spy, All sought Cassander though for severall ends. Cho. All as a pest them who are wretch'd doe slye: “Ecclipsed fortune threatens losse of friends. Nun. And she considering that she could not long Hold out the siege, since victuals were grown scant, Did send (as weake) for peace unto the strong. Cho. “Thus time and travell all things once may daunt. Nun. Then did Cassander know that need constraind Her so to bow, as every way diseas'd: And, though he her request not quite disdain'd, Yet the appointment was such as he pleas'd: For, all the favour that she could procure, Was leave to live a private person still; And yet of that she could not be made sure, Which did depend upon the Victors will. Then whilst Cassander sought his enemies ends, Huge numbers with him alwaies did abide. Cho. Yet might have many followers, and few friends: “Friends by the touch-stone of distresse are try'd. Nun. But though the Queen was rendred in this sort, A promise given that life should be preserv'd, The tyrant with her sprite could not comport, But from his faith, for her confusion swerv'd: The Macedonians were together brought, There to consult what did concerne their Queene: Of whom when as a number deepely thought, Both what she was, and what she once had beene; Even as Cassander had suborn'd them all, Their parents came whom she had damn'd to death, And did her rigour to remembrance call, By which the multitude was mov'd to wrath. Whilst from their brests all pitty quite was barr'd, They did conclude, their Queene behov'd to dye. Cho. Durst Subjects damne their Soveraign? and not heard? So still may clouds obscure the worlds bright eye. Nun. Yet did Cassander put (false every way) A maske of pitty on a cruell minde, And offred her a ship to flye away, As if to death against his will assign'd; Nor was this course for her delivery fram'd, But onely as by chance that she might drowne: So for her death that he might not be blam'd, But onely Neptune who had drunke her downe: Yet she (a Princesse of a mighty spright,) Whose lofty courage nothing could o're-come, Said, ere she scap'd by such a shamefull flight, That she would heare the Macedonians doome. But when Cassanders counsell was contemn'd, Lest that the multitude had chang'd their minde, When they remembred whom they had condemn'd, And did the fulnesse of his purpose finde, To rid her soone from paine, and him from feare, He sent some bands from pitty most estrang'd: Yet she 'gainst fortune did a banner beare, And not her heart, no, not her count'nance chang'd. She constant still, though mon'd, would never mone, Whose stately gesture brav'd their bold attempt, And did unite her vertues all in one, To grace disgrace, and glorifie contempt. She on two Ladies shoulders lean'd her armes, And with a Majestie did march to death, Like Alexander once amid'st th' alarmes, As if in triumph to abandon breath. “The height of vertue admiration brings, At this great magnanimity amaz'd: As at the image of their antient Kings; Or then some Goddesse all the Souldiers gaz'd: But (ah) some (forced by the tyrant) striv'd To spoile (unnaturall) Natures fairest frame, And twixt th' Alabaster Balles, they driv'd Th'unwilling swords that straight grew red for shame. Then, she in worth who did all else excell, Would neither word, nor teare, nor sigh forth send, But spread her garments o're her, whilst she fell, As of her honour jealous to the end. Cho. O strange barbarity, most monstrous deed! Could men a woman, Subjects kill their Queene: And could her fortune past no pitty breed? Who ever gave the wound, hath not her seene. The ugly Author of those odious evils, (Of punishment afraid) must still be sad, His brest a hell, his thoughts all turn'd to divels, (Through horrour of himselfe) must make him mad. Nun. And yet the plague of these detested times, Doth by more mischiefe aggravate our grones. Cho. “No end in sinne, crimes are maintain'd by crimes, “Who fall in depths, must touch the bottome once: “The path of honour hath but narrow bounds, “On which who step, attentive must remaine: “Since rais'd so high above the vulgar grounds, “That who thence fall can never rise againe. Nun. Thus now Cassander (since he cannot winne True reputation, but lives tainted still) Imbark'd in mischiefe, sailes the depths of sinne, So if not lov'd as good, yet fear'd as ill. Though (by his meanes) his ruthlesse eyes have seene Fates (as it were from fortunes bosome) take, His King by poyson, by the sword his Queene, Even yet himselfe more guilty still to make, He (prosp'ring in impiety) grew proud, And murdred both his Masters Sonne and Wife; Thus he, who all the world by birth-right ow'd, Could have no part of it, no, not his life. Yet could Roxanaes death not ease his minde, Nor her yong sonne, too soone made Plutoes guest: But to undoe all Alexanders kinde, That to revenge the rest, there might none rest. By treason he (as all his deeds are done) Caus'd Hercules his brothers steppes to trace, Who was great Alexanders bastard sonne, And th' onely remnant of that great mans race, Loe, thus Cassander, enemy to all good, Whose soule so much for Macedonie longs: Hath to the Scepter swim'd through Seas of bloud, Yet, O weake right, since builded but on wrongs! Cho. O, how ambition doth abuse the great! Who with enough not pleas'd, still strive for more: Loe, how our Soveraigne seem'd to raise his state, Yet made it but to fall whilst starv'd with store. And since his Trophees rear'd in severall fields, Both him and his have to confusion brought, “Then, what is all the good that greatnesse yeelds, “Which makes it selfe seem much to be made nought? “Thus, though the mountaines make a mighty show, “They are but barren heapes borne up aloft, “Where Plains are pleasant still, though they lye low, “And are most fertile too, though trod on oft. “Greatnesse is like a cloud in th'ayrie bounds, “Which some base vapours have congeal'd above: “It brawles with Vulcan, thundring forth huge sounds, “Yet melts and falles there whence it first did move. Phil. Since that worlds conqu'ror then whilst farre from feare, (By too much power press'd) so soone was dead: Why doe his Captaines strive who now should beare The Diadem that crush'd so strong a head? O! when my minde is ravish'd through the starres, To search the secret secrets of the fates: What treasons, murthers, mutinies and warres, Are threatning to o'rethrow usurped seates? That false Cassander who betraid his Lord, And spoil'd the princely race, in mischiefe chiefe, (A traitour both of heaven and earth abhorr'd) Shall live but with disgrace, and dye with griefe. His sonnes (in wickednesse himselfe t' exceed) Shall make the woman dye who made them live; Then both (when drunke with bloud) to death shall bleed, And none of theirs their funerals shall survive: When rash ambition should be cool'd by age, Lysimachus shall by Seleucus dye; Nor shall Seleucus long enjoy the Stage, But by like violence shall breathlesse lye; And subtile Ptolomies degener'd race, (Long onely famous for infamous things) Shall end and to the pride of foes give place, Whilst a lascivious Queene confusion brings; Antigonus shall be in battell kill'd, His Sonne a captive perish with disgrace And after that it Greece with bloud hath fill'd, In th' end, destruction doth attend that race; The last in pow'r (though of their line not bred) A niggard, and a dastard, beaten downe, Shall (through a strangers towne, a Captive led) Of Macedonie bound the old renowne. Chorus. “VVhat damned furies thus tosse mortals mindes, “With such a violent desire to raigne? “That neither honour, friendship, duty, bloud, “Nor yet no band so sacred is as bindes “Ambitious thoughts which would a kingdome gaine: “But all is buried in blacke Lethes floud, “That may the course of Soveraignty restraine, “Which from the brest doth all respects repell, “And like a torrent cannot be gaine-stood: “Yea many would, a Scepter to obtaine, “In spite of all the world, and Ioves owne wrath, “March through the lowest dungeons of the hels, “And from a Diademe would breath with pow'r, “Though all deaths engines brag'd them every houre, Yet, though such restlesse mindes attaine in th'end The height to which their haughty hearts aspir'd, They never can embrace that dreamed blisse, Which their deluded thoughts did apprehend; Though by the multitude they be admir'd, That still to pow'r doth shew it selfe submisse; Yet by the soule still further is requir'd, Which should seale up th' accomplishment of joy; “Thus partiall judgements blindely ayme amisse, “At things which stand without our reach retir'd, “Which whilst not ours, as treasures we define, “But not the same whilst we the same enjoy; “Some things a farre doe like the Glow-worme shine, “Which look't too neere, have of that light no signe. “No charge on th'earth more weighty to discharge, “Then that which of a kingdome doth dispose: “O! those who manage must the reynes of state, “Till their pale Ghost imbarke in Charons Barge, “They never need t'attend a true repose: “How hard is it to please each mans conceit, “When gaining one, they must another lose? “Thus, hardly Kings themselves can evenly beare, “Whom if severe (as cruell) subjects hate; “Contempt dare to the milde it selfe oppose; “Who spare in time, as niggards are despis'd, “Men from too franke a minde, exactions feare, “Though in all shapes (as Proteus us'd) disguis'd, “Kings by some scandall alwaies are surpris'd. Yet one might well with every thing comport, Which on opinion onely doth depend, If further danger follow'd not by deeds, But every Monarch (Loe) in many a sort Death (laid in ambush) alwaies doth attend; Of some by mut'nous swords the life forth bleeds; By unsuspected poyson others end, Which whilst they alwaies labour to prevent, A thousand deaths within their breasts life breeds; Loe, this is all for which the great contend, Who, (whilst their pride themselves and others spoiles) With their dominions doe their cares augment: “And O vaine man who toylest to double toyles, “Though still the victory the Victor foiles: Thus Alexander could not be appeas'd, Whilst he to raise his state did wayes prepare, Which when made most, diminish'd most remain'd, Where (with his fathers bounds had he beene pleas'd) He might have left our Crowne sure to his heire, Who by his conquest nought but death hath gayn'd; Yet for no paines a number now doth spare, To worke for that by which his wreake was wrought, Which (though from it they rage to be restrain'd) Would (if possest) their pleasures but impaire; Yet they by harme of others seeke the thing Which by their harme of others will be sought: “To him and his, each of them death would bring, “That it might once be said he was a King. “We may securely sitting on the shore, “Whilst great men doe (as toss'd on th' Ocean) grone, “Taught by their toyles, esteeme much of our rest: “For this doth thousands with affliction store, “VVhich of the world as most unhappy moane, “If they but chance to view some few more blest, “VVhere if they would but marke, how many a one “More wretch'd then they in misery doth live, “It straight would calme the most unquiet brest; “The Cottage oft is happier then the Throne; “To thinke our owne state good, and others ill: “It could not but a great contentment give: “There much consists in the conceit and will: “To us all things are as we thinke them still.
