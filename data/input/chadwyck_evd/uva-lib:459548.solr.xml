      <field name="fulltext">GABRIELL Hayle be thow, Marye, mother free, full of grace. God is with thee. Amongst all women blessed thow bee, and the fruite of thy bodye. MARIA Ah, lord that syttes high in see, that wondrouslye now mervayles meeâ a simple mayden of my degree bee greete this gratiously. GABRIELL Marye, ne dread thee nought this case. With greate God found thow hase amongst all other specyall grace. Therfore, Marye, thow mone conceyve and beareâI tell theeâ a childe. Jesus his name shalbeâ soe greate shall never non be as heeâ and called Godes Sonne. And owr lord God, leeve thow mee, shall give him Davyd his fathers see; in Jacobs howse rayninge shall hee with full might evermore. And hee that shalbe borne of thee, endlesse liffe in him shalbe, that such renowne and ryaltye had never non before. MARIA How may this bee, thow beast so bright? In synne knowe I noe worldly wight. GABRYELL The Holye Ghoste shall in thee light from God in majestee, and shadowe thee seemely in sight. Therefore that holye one, as I have height that thow shalt beare through Godes might, hee Sonne shall called bee. Elizabeth that barren was as thow maye see conceyved has in age a sonne through Godes grace, the [bedill] shalbe of blysse. The sixte moneth is gone now agayne seeth men called her barren; but nothinge to Godes might and mayne impossible is. MARIA Now syth that God will yt soe bee, and such grace hath sent to mee, blessed evermore bee hee; to please him I am payde. Loe, Godes chosen meekelye hereâ and lorde God, prince of powere, leeve that yt fall in suche manere this word that thow hast sayde. Tunc Angelus ibit, et Maria salutabit Elizabeth: Elizabeth, nece, God thee see. ELIZABETH Marye, blessed mote thow bee, and the fruites that commes of thee, amonge weomen all. Wonderlye now mervayles mee that Marye, Godes mother free, greetes mee thus of simple degree. Lord, how may this befall? When thow mee greetest, sweete Marye, the childe stirred in my bodye for great joye of thy companye and the fruite that is in thee. Blessed bee thow ever forthy, that lived soe well and stedfastly; for that was sayde to thee, ladye, fulfilled and done shalbee. Maria gaudiens incipiet canticum âMagnificatâ etc. MARIA Elizabeth, therefore will I thanke the lord, kinge of mercye, with joyfull myrth and melody and laud to his likinge. âMagnificat,â while I have toome, âanima mea dominumâ to Christe that in my kind is come, devoutly I will singe. âEt exultavit spiritus meus in Deoâ etc. And for my ghost joyed hase in God, my heale and all my graceâ for meekenes hee see in mee was, his feare of meane degreeâ therfore blesse mee well maye all generacons for aye. Mych has that lord done for mee, that moste is in his majestye. All princes hee passis of postee, as sheweth well by this. Therefore with full hart and free his name allway hallowed be; and honored evermore be hee one height in heaven blysse. Mych hase God done for me today; his name eye hollowed be, as he is bound to doe mercy from progenye to progenye. And all that dredene him veryly, his talent to fullfill, hee through his myght gave maystery. Disparcles proud dispytuusly with myght of his harte hastely at his owne will. Deposethe myghty oute of place, and mylde allso he hansed hasse; hongry, nydy, wanting grace with god hee hath fullfellede. That rych power he hath forsakene; To Iseraell, his Sonne he hath betakene. Wayle to man throughe him his wakinge, and myrcy hasse of his guylteâ as he spake to our fathers before, Abrahame and his syde full yore. Joy to the Father evermore, the Sone, and the Holy Ghoste, as was from the begininge and never shall have endinge, from world to world aye wendinge. Amen, God of might most. ELIZABETH Marye, now redd I that wee gone to Joseph thy husband anon, lesse hee to misse thee make mone; for now that is moste neede. MARIA Elizabeth, nece, to doe so good is, leste hee suppose one mea amysse; but good lord that hath ordayned this wyll witnes of my deede. ELIZABETH Joseph, God thee save and see! Thy wife here I brought to thee. JOSEPH Alas, alas, and woe is mee! Whoe hasse made her with chyld? Well I wist an ould man and a maye might not accord by noe waye. For many yeares might I not playe ne worke noe workes wild. Three monethes shee hath bine from mee. Now hasse shee gotten her, as I see, a great bellye like to thee syth shee went away. And myne yt is not, bee thow bould, for I am both ould and could; these xxxt i e winters, though I would, I might not playe noe playe. Alas, where might I lenge or lende? For loth is mee my wife to shende, therfore from her will I wende into some other place. For to dyscreeve will I nought, feeblye though shee have wrought. To leave her privelye is my thought, that noe man knowe this case. God, lett never [an] ould man take to wife a yonge woman ney seet his harte her upon, lest hee beguyled bee. For accorde ther maye be none, ney the may never bee at one; and that is seene in manye one as well as one mee. Therfore have I slept a while, my wife that mee can thus beguyle, for I will gone from her; yt to fyle mee ys loth, in good faye. This case makes mee so heavye that needes sleepe nowe muste I. Lord, one hir thow have mercye for her misdeede todaye. ANGELUS Joseph, lett bee thy feeble thought. Take Marye thy wife and dread thee nought, for wickedly shee hath not wrought; but this is Godes will. The child that shee shall beare, iwys of the Holy Ghost begotten yt is to save mankynd that did amisse, and prophecye to fulfill. JOSEPH A, nowe I wott, lord, yt is soe, I will noe man bee her foe; but while I may one yearth goe, with her I will bee. Nowe Christe is in our kynde light, as the prophetes before hight. Lord God, most of might, with weale I worshipp thee. NUNTIUS Make rowme, lordinges, and give us waye and lett Octavian come and playe, and Sybell the sage, that well fayre maye, to tell you of prophecye. That lord that dyed on Good Frydaye, hee have you all both night and daye. Farewell, lordinges. I goe my waye; I may noe lenger abyde. OCTAVIANUS I, preeved prince most of powere, under heaven highest am I here; fayrest foode to fight in fere, noe freake my face may flee. All this world, withowten wereâ kinge, prynce, baron, batchlereâ I may destroy in great dangere through vertue of my degree. My name Octavian called isâ all me about full in my blys, for wholey all this world, iwys, is readye at my owne will. Noe man one mould darre doe amisse agaynst meeâI tell you thisâ nay no man saye that ought is his but my leave be thertyll. For I halfe multiplyed more the cittye of Rome sythe I was bore then ever did any before, syth I had this kingdome. For what with strenght and strokes sore, leadinge lordshipp, lovely lore, all this world has bine yore tributarye unto Rome. Segneurs, tous si assembles a mes probes estates! Jeo posse fayre lerment et leez, et mette in languoure! Vous tous si prest ne sortes de fayre intentes ma volentes, car je su soveroyne ben sages et de mande emperoure. Jeo si persone, nulle si able; jeo sa tent fayre et leable. En treasoroce ne treasagyle, mes de toyle plerunt. Destret et sage sua en counsellâami, ou dame, et ou pusele. De clare et sanke mater frayle, un teell n'est paas viva. Kinge, coysell, clarke, or knight, saudens, senatoures in sight, princes, pryest here nowe dight and present in this place, peace! Or here my truthe I plightâ I am the manfulst man of mightâ takes mynde on my manece. All leedes in land bee at my likinge: castle, conquerour, and kinge bayne be to doe my byddinge; yt will non other bee. Right as I thinke, soe must all bee; for all the world dose my willinge and bayne bine when I bydd bringe homage and feoaltye. Sythen I was lord, withowten lesse with my witt I can more increase the empire here then ever yt was, as all this world yt wiste. Syth I was soverayne, warre cleare can cease, and through this world now is peace, for soe dreade a duke sate never on dayes in Romeâthat you may trust. Therfore as lorde nowe likes mee to preeve my might and my postee, for I will send about and see how many heades I have. All the world shall written bee, great and smale in eych degree that dwell in shire or in cittyeâ king, clarke, knight, and knave. Eych man one penye shall paye. Therfore, my bedell, doe as I saye. In middest the world by anye waye this gammon shall begine. The folke of Jewes, in good faye, in myddest bine; that is noe naye. Therefore thyder, daye by daye, and travayle or thow bline. Warne him that there ys president that this is fully myne intent: that eych man appere present, his penye for to paye. And by that penye as well appent knowledge to bee obedyente to Rome, by gifte of such a rent, from that tyme after aye. When thus is done thus in Judye, that in the middest of the world shalbe, to eych land, shire, and cyttye to Rome make them soe thrall. Warne them, boyeâI commande theeâ they doe the same, saye thus from mee; soe all this world shall witt that wee bine soveraygne of them all. Have donne, boye! Art thow not bowne? PRECO All readye, my lorde, by Mahounde. Noe tayles tupp in all this towne shall goe further withowten fayle. OCTAVIANUS Boye, therfore by my crowne thow muste have thy warrysoun! The highest horse besydes Boughton take thow for thy travell. PRECO Grauntemercye, lord, perdye; this hackney will well serve mee, for a great lord of your degree should ryde in such araye. The bine hye in dignitye, and alsoe high and swifte is hee. Therefore that reverans takes yee, my deare lord, I you praye. But your arrand shalbe donne anone. First into Judye I will gonne and sommon the people everychone, both shire and eke cyttye. OCTAVIANUS Boye, there bine ladyes manye one; amonge them all chose thee onne. Take the fayrest or els none, and freely I give her thee. PRIMUS SENATOUR My lord Octavyan, wee be sent from all Rome with good entent. Thy men there have eychone iment as God to honour thee. And to that poynct we be assent, poore and ryche in parleament. For soe loved a lord, veramente, was never in this cyttye. SECUNDUS SENATOR Yea sicker, syr, ther will is this: to honour thee as God with blys, for thow did never to them amysse in worde, thought, ne deede. Peace hath bine longe and yett is. Noe man in thy tyme lost ought of his. Therfore there wyll is soe, iwys, to quite you this your meede. OCTAVIANUS Welcome, my frendes, in god faye, for you bee baynable to my paye. I thank you, all that ever I maye, the homage yee doe to mee. But follye yt were by manye a waye such soveraygntye for to assaye, syth I must dye I wotte not what day, to desyre such dignitye. For of all flesh, blood, and bonne made I am, borne of a womane; and sycker other matter nonne sheweth not right in mee. Neyther of iron, tree, ne stonne am I not wrought, you wott eychone. And of my life moste parte is gone, age shewes him soe in mee. And godhead askes in all thinge tyme that hath noe begininge ne never shall have endinge; and none of this have I. Wherfore by verey proofe shewinge, though I bee highest worldly kinge, of godhead have I noe knowinge. Hit were unkynde. But yett enquyre of this will wee of hir that hase grace to see thinges that afterward shalbe by ghoost of prophecye. And after hir lore, by my lewtye, discussinge this difficultye worke; and take noe more one mee then I am well worthye. Sybbell the sage, tell mee this thinge, for thow wytt hase as noe man livinge: shall ever be any earthlye kinge to passe mee of degree? SYBBELL Yea, syr, I tell you withowt leasinge a bab borne shalbe, blys to bringe, the which that never hase begininge ne never shall ended bee. OCTAVYANUS Sybbyll, I praye thee speciallye by signe thow would me certyfye what tyme that lord soe royallye to raigne hee shal beginne. Sybyll speaketh: Syr, I shall tell you witterlye his signes when I see verelye; for when hee comes, through his mercye one mankynde hee will mynne. Well I wott, forsooth iwys, that God will bringe mankinde to blys, and send from heavenâleeves well thisâ his Sonne, our savyour. But what tyme, syr, in good faye that hee will come can I non saye. Therfore in this place I will praye to greatest God of might. And yf I see ought to your paye ghoostlye by anye waye, warne you I shall anon this daye, and shew yt in your sight. Tunc orat Sibilla, et dicat Preco alta voce. PRECO Peace I byd, kinge and knight, men and weomen and eych wight; tyll I have tould that I have tight, stonde styll, both stronge and stoute. My lord Octavyan, myche of might, commandes you should be readye dight: trybute hee wyll have in height of all this world about. Hee wyll have written eych countree, castle, shyre, and eke cyttyeâ men and weomen, leeve you meeâ and all that bee therin. A penye of eych man have will heeâ the valewe of ten pences hit shalbeeâ to knowledge that hee hase soverayntee fullye of all mankynd. JOSEPHE A, lord, what doth this man nowe here? Poore mens weale ys ever in were. I wott by this bosters beere that trybute I muste paye. And for greate age and noe powere, I wan noe good this seaven yere. Nowe comes the kinges messinger to gett all that hee maye. With this axe that I beare, this perces and this naugere and hammer, all in fere, I have wonnen my meate. Castle, towre, ney riche manere had I never in my power; but as a symple carpenter with those what I might gett. If I have store, anye thinge, that must I paye unto the kinge. But yett I have a likinge, the angell to mee towlde: hee that should man owt of bale bringe my wife had in her keapinge. That seemes all good to my likinge, and makes mee more bowld. A, leeffe syr, tell mee I thee praye: shall poore as well as rych paye? My faye, syr, I hoope naye; that were a wonders wronge. PRECO Good man, I warne thee in good faye to Bethlem to take the waye, leste thow in danger falle todaye if that thow bee to longe. JOSEPHE Nowe syth yt may non other bee, Marye, sister, now hye wee. An oxe I will take with mee that there shalbe soulde. The silver of him, soe mote I thee, shall fynde us in that cyttye, and paye tribute for thee and mee; for therto wee bine howlde. MARIA A, lord, what may this signifye? Some men I see glad and merye and some syghinge and sorye. Wherfore soever yt bee? Syth Godes Sonne came man to forbyeâ is commen through his great mercyeâ methinke that man should kindlye be glad that sight to see. ANGELUS Marye, Godes mother dere, the tokeninge I shall thee lere. The commen people, as thow seest here, are gladâas they well mayeâ that they shall see of Abrahams seede Christe come to helpe them in there neede. Therfore the joyen withowten dreede for to abyde this daye. The morneinge menâtake this in myndeâ are Jewes that shalbe put behinde, for they passed owt of kinde through Christe at his comminge. For they shall have noe grace to knowe that God for man shall light soe lowe; for shame on them that soone shall showe. Therfore they bine mourninge. JOSEPH Marye, suster, sooth to saye harbour, I hope, gett wee ne maye; for great lordes of stowte araye occupye this cyttye. Therfore wee muste in good faye lye in this stable tyll yt bee daye. To make men meeke, leeve I maye, shew him here will hee. MARIA Helpe me downe, my leeffe fere, for I hope my tyme bee neere. Christe in this stable that ys here, I hope borne wilbee. Tunc Joseph accipiet Mariam in brachia sua. JOSEPH Come to me, my sweete dere, the treasure of heaven withowten were. Welcome in full meeke manere. Him hope I for to see. Tunc statuet Mariam inter bovem et asinam. Marye, sister, I will assaye to gett too middwives yf I maye; for though in thee bee God vereyâ and commen agaynst kyndeâ for usage here of this cittye and manners sake, as thinkes mee, too I will fetch anon to thee yf I may any fynde. JOSEPH (ad obstetrices) Weomen, God you save and see! Is yt your will to goe with mee? My wife ys commen into this cyttye with child, and tyme is nere. Helpes her nowe for charytee, and bee with her tyll day bee; and your travayle, soe mote I thee, I shall paye you right here. TEBELL All readye, good man, in good faye. Wee will doe all that ever wee maye. For too such middwives, I dare well saye, are not in this cyttye. SALOME Come, good man, leade us awaye. By Godes helpe or hit bee daye that we can good thy wife shall saye; and that thow shalt well see. JOSEPH Loe, Marye, harte, brought I have here too middwives for the mannere, to bee with thee, my darlinge deare, tyll that hit bee daye. MARIA Syr, the be welcome withowt were. But God will worke of his power full sonne for mee, my lefe fere, as best is nowe and aye. Tunc paululum acquiescunt. A, Joseph, tydinges aright! I have a sonne, a sweete wight. Lord, thanked bee thow, full of might, for preeved is thy postee. Payne felte I non this night. But right soe as hee in mee light, commen hee is here in this sightâ Godes Sonne, as thow maye see. Tunc stella apparebit. JOSEPH Lord, welcome, sweete Jesu! Thy name thow haddest or I thee knewe. Nowe leeve I the angells worde is trewe, that thow arte a cleane maye. For thow arte commen mans blys to brewe to all that thy lawe will shewe. Nowe mans joy beginns to newe and noye to passe awaye. MARIA Lord, blessed most thow bee that [symple] borne art, as I see; to preeve the divell of his postee, commen thow arte todaye. Diversorye is non for thee. Therfore thy sweete bodye free in this cratch shall lye with lee, and lapped abowt with haye. TEBELL A, dere lord, heaven kinge, that this is a marvelous thinge! Withowten teene or travaylinge, a fayre sonne shee hasse one. I dare well saye, forsooth iwys, that cleane mayden this woman ys, for shee hath borne a chyld with blys; soe wiste I never none. SALOME Be styll, Tebell, I thee praye, for that is false, in good faye. Was never woman cleane maye and chyld withowt man. But never the latter, I will assaye whether shee bee cleane maye, and knowe yt if I cann. Tunc Salome tentabit tangere Mariam in sexu secreto, et statim arentur manus eius, et clamando dicit: Alas, alas, alas, alas, mee ys betyde an evyll case! My handes bee dryed up in this place, that feelinge none have I. Vengeance on mee ys nowe light, for I would tempte Goddes might. Alas, that I came here tonight to suffer such anoye. Tunc apparet stella et veniet Angelus, [dicens] ut sequitur. [ANGELUS] Womann, beseech this childe of grace that hee forgive thee thy trespasse; and ere thow goe owt of this place holpen thou maye bee. This miracle that now thow seest here is of Godes owne powere, to bringe mankinde owt of dangere and mende them, leeve thow mee. SALOME Ah, sweete child, I aske mercye for thy mothers love, Marye. Though I have wrought wretchedlye, sweete childe, forgive yt mee. Ah, blessed bee God! All whole am I! Nowe leeve I well and sickerlye that God is commen, man to forbye. And thou, lord, thou art hee. EXPOSITOR Loe, lordings all, of this miracle here freere Bartholemewe in good mannere beareth wytnes, withowten were, as played is you beforne. And other myracles, yf I maye, I shall rehearse or I goe awaye, that befell that ilke daye that Jesus Christ was borne. Wee reade in cronicles expresse: somtyme in Rome a temple was made of soe greate ryches that wonder was witterlye. For all thinges in hit, leeve you mee, was silver, gould, and rych perlye; thryd parte the worlde, as read wee, that temple was worthye. Of eych province, that booke mynde mase ther goddes image sett there was; and eych on abowt his necke has a silver bell hanginge, and on his brest written also the landes name and godes too. And sett was alsoe in middest of tho god of Rome, right as a kinge. Abowt the house alsoe mevinge there a man on horseâstoode men to steareâ and in his hand hee bare a spere, all pure dispituouslye. That horse and man was made of brasse; torninge abowt that image was. Save certayne preystes ther might non passe for devylls phantasie. But when that any lande with battell was readye Rome for to assayle, the godes [image] withowten fayle of that land range his bell and torned his face dispituouslye to god of Rome, as reade I, in tokeninge that there were readye to feyghtinge freshe and fell. The image alsoe above standinge, when the bell beneath begane to ringe, torned him all sharpely, shewinge towarde that lande his spere. And when they see this tokeninge, Rome ordayned withowt tareinge an oste to keepe there comminge, longe or they came there. And on this manere sothlye, by arte of neagromancye, all the world witterlye to Rome were made to lowt. And in that temple there dowbtles was called therfore the Temple of Peace, that through his sleyt battell can cease throughowt the world, the worlde abowte. But hee to coyntly this worke caste asked the devyll or hee paste howe longe that temple hit should laste that hee there can buylde. The devill answered suttillye, and sayd yt should last sickerlye untyll a mayden wemmostlye had conceyved a chylde. They hard, and beleeved therfore yt should endure for evermore. But that tyme that Christ was bore, hit fell downe soone in hye. Of which howse is seene this daye somewhat standinge, in good faye. But noe man dare well goe that waye for feendes phantasye. That daye was seene verament three sonnes in the firmament, and wonderslye together went and torned into one. The oxe, the asse, ther they were lent, honored Christe in theyr intent; and moe miracles, as wee have ment to playe right here anon. Tunc ostendet stellam, et veniet Sibilla ad imperatorem. SIBILLA Syr emperour, God thee save and see. I tell you sicker that borne ys hee that passeth thee of postee. Looke up on height after mee. That baron thow seest that great shalbeeâ to passe all kinges, and eke thee, that borne are or ever were. OCTAVYAN A, Sibbell, this is a wondrouse sight, for yonder I see a mayden bright, a yonge chylde in her armes clight, a bright crosse in his head. Honour I wyll that sweete wight with incense throughowt all my might, for that reverence is most right, if that yt bee thy reade. Incense bringe, I command, in hye to honour this child, kinge of mercye. Should I bee God? Naye, naye, witterlye! Great wronge iwys yt were. For this childe is more worthye then such a thowsande as am I. Therfore to God moste mightye incense I offer here. Tunc Angelus cantabit âHaec est ara Dei caeliâ; fiat notam secundum arbitrium agentis, etc. A, Sybbell, heres not thow this songe? My members all yt goeth amonge. Joy and blys makes my harte stronge to heare this melody. Sycker yt may non other bee but this childe is prince of postye and I his subject, as I see. Hee is moste worthye. SYBBELL Yea, syr, thow shalt leeve well this: somewhere one yearth borne he is; and that hee comes for mans blys, his tokeninge this can shewe. Reverence him, I read iwys, for other God there none ys; that hopes otherwise, doth amys, but him for Christe to knowe. OCTAVYAN Syr senators, goes home anone and warne my men everychone that such worshipp I must forgonne as they would doe to mee. But this child worshipp eych maye with full harte all that you [can], for hee is worthye to leeve upon; and that nowe I wyll see. [PRIMUS SENATOR] A, lord, whatever this may bee, this is a wondrous sight to see; for in the stare, as thinkes mee, I see a full fayre maye. Syr, shall this child passe yee of worthines and dignitee? Such a lord, by my lewtye, I wend never had binne. EXPOSITOR Lordings, that this is verey by verey sygne knowe yee maye; for in Rome in good faye, thereas this thinge was seene, was buyld a church in noble arayeâ in worshipp of Marye, that sweete mayeâ that yett lastes untyll this daye, as men knowe that there have binne. And for to have full memorye of the angells melodye and of this sight sickerlye the emperoure ther knewe, the church is called St. Marye. The surname is Ara Caeli, that men knowe nowe well therby that this was fullye trewe. Another miracle I fynd also, at Christes byrth that fell thoo: when Salome attempted to knowe whether shee was a maye, hyr hand roted, as you have seene. Wherby you may take good teene that unbeleeffe is a fowle sinne, as you have seene within this playe. Finis</field>
