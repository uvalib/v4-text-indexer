      <field name="fulltext">THE PIROMIDES. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATED TO THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF ELGIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Piromis. Inaros. Horos. Psammenitos, King of the Egyptians. Siuphis. Chilon. Ladice. Cambyses, King of the Persians. Nitetis. Priests of Isis, Egyptians, Persians, etc.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. PIROMIS. Yon star, the oldest prophet of the dawn, Fulfils its task and quits a gloomy world. Deep strikes the chill into the dusky morn, As now she draws her twilight mantle round, And hails yon streaks of feeble light which burst The eastern sky and scatter roseate tints Along the tract of day. And indistinct This crowded pile of dome and column frowns, As if lugubrious night still clung around Enamour'd of the grandeur. Dreadful fane, Which hides so vast a portion of the heaven Encentering grace in the surrounding Ã¦ther, And thou unsleeping Isis, still within Fix'd in eternal presence, how my years 'Neath ye have glided into latest age! Tho' it be pride in me to haunt thy shrine, O grant this intellect may not decay; O grant my prayer that I may breathe my last Within thy sanctuary! PIROMIS, INAROS. INAROS. Name an hour When shall commence the sacrifice. PIROMIS. The sun Not yet along the gilded avenue Unfolding now before his car, appears: Let sunrise be the signal to commence. Thou to the daughter of our monarch hie, And learn the latest news. The virgin loves Thy presence, and may render to thine ear What she hath gather'd from th'ensanguin'd field. She hath the earliest speech of messenger. Besides 'tis said that with prophetic sight She gazes at the future: this perchance, Though but the tale of ignorance, may draw For its foundation on a watchful mind, And prove her fit to hold her sire's command. Should King Cambyses conquer, soon his threats Would be fulfilled to desecrate our fane. Chiefly for this Nitetis lures him hither Gall'd at the loss of empire, and convinced That I dictated her long banishment. And yet at large is left the early cause Of all our fears, all Egypt's miseries, Even Horos, whose impiety hath call'd These pending sorrows o'er our fated heads. The priests enter and prepare the sacrifice in the presence of a large concourse of people, and during the ceremony the choruses are chaunted. Before the column'd glory of thy fane Our voices sink, humbled by conscious woe. O Isis, save our thoughts from wandering! In inspiration pour on every heart A knowledge of thy attributes divine; Impress deep awe of that beneath the veil. O Isis! horned queen, earth's mystery! Suppliant we raise the choral hymn on high. Our king and all his host, thy worshippers, Now meet the Persian armies in the field: Award the victory to thy righteous land. CHORUS. Isis, horned Isis, hail! Let twilight gleam beneath the veil, And shed a momentary ray along The choral throng, To show the penetrating thrill of love Is heard above. Ancient-statued Destiny, Whose godhead moves the starry sky! O cast a look of deity below Upon the foe; And will that the invading hordes may meet A swift defeat. The king, 'midst terrors and the shafts of death, Fill with thy breath. To keep him safe thou need'st but will him so. Permit not woe To light upon Anysios, his child, The undefiled, Nor on Ladice, who in royal tow'rs Counts the slow hours. Preserve her blooming loveliness from blight, Soft sleep by night Pour on her eyes, and shed across her dream Hope's cheering beam. Preserve the orders as of old: The sacred priest, the warrior bold; The sage who scans his mystic rolls; The pilot who the bark controls; Artificers of varied toil, And herdsmen, dwellers on the soil. Our sky is beauteous day and night, Still as thyself its beatific light. Our land, the gift of the dread river, Careless of showers pours forth its fruits for ever. When the broad waters backward flow, And labouring herds have trodden down the soil, The wholesome rice and millet grow, Nor want like other regions human toil. PIROMIS. We were the first to honour thee below, And temples o'er thine earthly presence throw, Where pious natures find a solitude, And the aspiring soul becomes imbued With watchful hope for hidden things on high; By us first taught itself can never die. CHORUS. We were the first of men to find Mark'd on the spheres the twelve-divided year, The first of mortals who divin'd The seat of the divinity was there. Before our race She had no name, Omnipotent without terrestial fame. We were the first to altars build, The first who statues with the godhead fill'd, By passion for immortal wisdom fir'd And by the fates in happy hour inspir'd. We bade the granite rocks receive The giant shapes of things that live; The first that wondrous art to grace Which glory gives an earthly dwelling-place, Arresting the oblivion-seeking past In sculptur'd presence to for ever last. The ever fair, the ever good, Have haunted long thy neighbourhood; Thy rites perform'd with reverence due, Thy face conceal'd from vulgar view. PIROMIS. As calm as thou, in form as vast, Three hundred fathers of our line, Deathless escape th'absorbing past And stand about thy mighty shrine; While on the earth beneath they cast Eyes ever mindful of the past. The dread Piromides look on In dread of Isis Buceron. CHORUS. Isis, horned Isis, hail! Let twilight gleam beneath the veil And shed a momentary ray along The choral throng, To shew the penetrating thrill of love Is heard above. PIROMIS. And now, O people! in the pious hope That Egypt's trouble touches the Most High, In joy depart; our sacrifice and prayers Have found acceptance at the gates of Heaven. This hour expels the stranger from our shores. PIROMIS, INAROS. PIROMIS. These antique usages thy sires began When from the pristine government of Nile The gods retired; and we observe them still In fullest purity: the time of fast, The sacrifice, the holy form of prayer. So was it long before this structure rose Into majestic state. Soon shalt thou learn What in these sacred walls is kept conceal'd From vulgar view; with what a zealous care The unpolluted secrets of the earth Ensculptur'd deep in waste-defying stone, Are here preserved. A thoughtful monument, Illegible as nature to the gaze, And to supremest reason not less hard To be decipher'd than the vault of heaven. In this colossal treasure-house of fame Dread Isis on her orbed throne accepts The offerings of the holy, and unites On the imposing tablets of her fane The thoughtful forms of things in solemn sign. Here is the meaning of the universe; Here time's exhaustless circles hold the doom Of Fate herself. But living who can scan These so miraculous deeds of elder mind? Pure as the fountain whence creation flowed, They by first thought, as soon as reason came, Found record in this mind-protecting soil. And to what end? Insatiate of life, Transfixed by vision's inward gaze, I stand In statued meditation, and revolve Th'Ånigmas of the voiceless infinite; But search each token only to endure The chilling silence of eternity. Still I advance, lest in my sadness 'spoil'd Of truth's fair meaning, for a phrenzied dream I read her portents. INAROS. Would the day were come When I may study to discern the light Which burns for ever in this tomb of truth! Could I deceive the slowly passing years And scathe my youthful countenance to age How joyous were I; for the aged liveâ Live on with youth, altho' the first to drop. PIROMIS. Thy day will come too soon. INAROS. Great sire, too soon? PIROMIS. O be contented in thine innocence. Thus saith the goddess in a prophecy She once deliver'd to the human race: âNo son of man shall ever raise my veil.â That sad aspiring look which clings to hope, Thou may'st prolong, but never let it urge Thy love of wisdom to impiety, Lest the vain struggle end in sullen death Thy disappointed years. Thou dost not long For intellectual sorrow? INAROS. Mighty priest, Can so much love of wisdom end in woe? PIROMIS. Not where humility adorns the way. But who accustom'd to the bright excess Of pensive revelry can be content To feed on simple vision? Men there are Who pause before the midway paths of thought, And in the comeliness of earth and heaven Seem fully bless'd; they never seek a cause, But with their utmost instinct truth revere. Beyond, where legislative nature acts From day apart in solid darkness veil'd, The constant watch is ever made in vain. The tortur'd sight reads ill; the gloom absorbs The feeble spirit's rays, that what appears Is in eclipse, and twilight chills the soul. These ills are mingled in the universe, Else beauteous to the thinker: he may scan Its aptitudes, and that necessity Which all controls and keeps the gods in place; The placid aristocracy of time, Its swift mutations thro' the star-pav'd space Which leads to the unbeing infinite; Tho' but to find the love is his alone. He walks the golden city of the sky With pious step, its solemn domes admires, And rising spires of never fading light, To feel how blest it were to be divine. Seest thou those signals of supernal ire? Heaven speaks by signs! I know the warning power That guides the course of yonder meteor Which bathes the palaces in floods of light And leaves a deepening gloom. Declare my son What thou hast learn'd of the philosophy Which boasts the moral nature of the world Above this intellect, man's only law? Horos the sage propounds these daring views, A man whose foil'd ambition is the foe Of public order. He was once thy friend. Enrapt in self he leads a life retir'd; Not one of solitude! his gorgeous mind In commune ever with colossal thought, But the sad aspect of it daring hate To hallow'd fanes. INAROS. In nature rests his hope. He meekly worships her as saddest smiles Dispart his lips and show how little joy His faith provides. But his philosophy Wins on the feelings of the multitude. Those eyes, of youth so gently eloquent, That brow which wears the honours of old age Without the wither'd aspect, must command A pause ere we condemn. PIROMIS. As he stands forth Are many hearers gather'd? INAROS. Thousands flock Eager to catch his words as if his lips Shap'd deathless maxims: thus his eloquence Gains strong possession of the people's sense. His life so blameless and his passing skill In utt'ring sounds of liberty, have drawn An auditory round him. As a sage, Amid shade-pointing statues doth his speech Move the broad flood of passion 'yond its bounds To laughter or to tears. PIROMIS. I have heard say He is a miser of the golden hours? INAROS. He treasures well his time. At earliest morn He meets the restless converts of his faith And human nature flatters with the hope Of self-advancement, painting scenes so grand To mortal ken, that all desire to seize The distant view and quit their present lot. He then retires, and 'till the twilight hour Ponders the chance of happiness for man. But with the daily coming of the eve Some silent, deep and secret grief invades, That, as the sun in liquid brilliancy Seeks tremblingly the west, his longing eyes Pursue its last decline and envious watch In saddest gaze the orb's approaching rest, As tho' it were eternal. PIROMIS. Say what wound, So deep it cannot heal, torments his flesh? INAROS. He lov'd Nitetis: she his love return'd. Lov'd her in that too constant agony Of faithful hope which never leaves the heart. Believe his nature harmless tho' his deeds Are mark'd by scorn, and by a calm revenge Against presiding orders. For his love Predominates with a so lofty care, That all his acts are centred in its shade And soften'd by its sorrows. PIROMIS. Such a cause Could never sour his thoughtful character, In such strange earnest; turn from its straight course The eye's regard, the spirit's tendency; Inflate the breast with sudden zeal to aid His fellow men? It was by my advice Nitetis went to Susa and became The consort of Cambyses. Seek the sage, And once his hearing gain'd, thou cans't revert To childish times and entertain his ear With pure remembrances of holy days, Until the present ebbs into the past And he is as a child. Then will he touch, As one returning to his native land After protracted absence passed in cares, On magic memory of former hopes The solemn pleasures and eventful rites Of Isis light-encircled! Lo! the gods In anger that his tenets spread, afflict A numerous people; omens threaten us; A haughty conqueror from the rising sun With hosts unnumber'd sounds the trump of war. But to the palace hasten for what news Thou may'st collect; then Horos be thy care. Should he resist thy wishes, lead him here Before the assembl'd conclave. INAROS. Is the power Which emanates from this celestial fane Endanger'd by his rashness? Are the laws Which thro' the ancient centuries descend Thro' him at stake? PIROMIS. They are. INAROS. Thou know'st my faith. Would'st thou that I should wrestle dagger-armed With this rebellious thinker, and a grave For our past friendship sink within his heart? PIROMIS. Banish the thought to endless penitence, Nor in its exile let it cease to mourn. Leave me, disciple, to my lonely prayers. The folding doors of the temple are thrown open and the statue of Isis is discovered. The Piromis kneels before the goddess. Ah! what am I! Pervading Destiny Who dost create, destroy, and still survive The beings who in reason thee adore And wonder, as in feeling they lament; Who dost thy nature find immutable Midst changing worlds and knowest why they change; Reveal! The stillness of thy attitude Strikes awe, and thy silential gaze condemns. O say! is mind not ever living? Thou Hast shar'd thy lasting glory with the spheres Which are ordained to shine eternally: Is then the human spirit's watchfulness Unhonor'd; and, while pensive as thyself, Forc'd to submit to its creator's doom? Or rather say is not this love of self So after thine own image, that alone Of all that is thou would'st persist to be? I daily change, and soon my star of life Must set beneath the shadows of the tombs To see thy face no more. But thou wilt reign, Imparting rapture in my dying hour, Unmov'd, serene, thron'd on thy mystic orb, Too confident of life to have an end, Still burning in self-glory. And thy light Casts only a reflection on the dust Whence came, and whereunto this shape returns. If but the cup of knowledge could have quench'd This thirst which is unsated, I had cast My reckless soul with all its weight of truth In that abyss where essence perishes, The deep, the tranquil, the unoccupied, And gloried in the vast non-entity My fate entail'd; no more unrecompens'd From early dawn unto the vesper hour To ponder thee; nor to remorseless Sleep A prey, who nightly shadows in my mind A chaos of reflection. O my soul! Can'st tell without thy wonted flattery, For thou alone can'st answer thine own thoughts, What spirit dares inhabit this worn breast In torture, thinking but to dread itself? I ponder thus my themes, and spite of gloom In their majestic movement thro' the soul Do they light up the mental firmament And shed a pensive joy; but this dissolves: 'Twas but a meteor in the bosom's waste Had charm'd the desolation. Was it just O Isis, to create thy peer in will And not in wisdom? one who told, could grasp Thy dreadful meaning! So the rebel heart Within its dungeon struggles: neither night Nor day can compensate the weight of life. Enter a Priest. What wilt thou, man? PRIEST. With reverence I announce The holy conclave of Piromides Awaits its pious president. PIROMIS. I come. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. LADICE, SLAVE. LADICE. Tired of incessant vigil every hour This heart beats with a feebler stroke of hope, And still awaits a messenger in vain. I have watch'd the folded gates from day to day, And caged within their massive gloom my sense Unsteady grows, and dim, that I relapse Into intense oblivion of the world, But feebly conscious of my loneliness. Why this delay? that no intelligence Of Egypt's destiny doth break the spell Of my suspense, no animating voice Should reach the lonely daughter of the king That he is safe and that her brother lives! No ray of consolation! I am pale And worn, and suffer from the want of rest. Night, the encourager of bold designs Not with its coming sheds ideal light On me, but ushers in unearthly gloom, That in the distance hope's undying lamp Emits a circle dismal and confin'd. My eyes pursue the stalking phantasies Which tread with airy limbs the black expanse, And heedless pass the mirror of the soul. Or starting from my couch at some strange sound That smites upon my ear, I look afar As to descry the tented field where moves On watch the lofty figur'd sentinel, But all is still except the plash of waves, Or wing of some black Ibis on the stream, Or agitated lotos. Cold with dread, The new resolve to woo oblivious sleep I entertain, but night more earnest grows, And with unhappy purposes unfolds Her sable-clouded scroll where ghastly thought Reads imaged terrors and inhuman deeds. SLAVE. Think not so sadly lady, but apply Refreshment to thy lips; thy pallid hue Bespeaks a want of food. LADICE. I need not that. My aspect is the image of a mind Wherein despair seeks hospitality. Thou art a slave, no lover of the soil, Or had the drooping anguish of my eyes Met sister grief in thee. SLAVE. Indeed not so; Is not my home a station at thy side? Pleas'd only in the flow of thy delights, And sad whenever thou art sorrowful, My feelings live in thine. LADICE. My grateful girl, In mercy to thy love I would be glad. But when in sight of woe we try to laugh What mockery we feel! It is too much; The merry trouble ends in bitterness, And is convuls'd to tears ere it hath power To reach calm grief again. SLAVE. What so great cause Of sadness pours these sobbings from thy breast? Methinks I ne'er have seen thro' falling tears Those lustrous eyes before. LADICE. My lonely hours Have not betrayed their mistress' confidence Or they had told how often I have wept. Hath it not reach'd thine ear, that at the verge Of the Pelusian shore my country's fate Pends on the issue of a single fight? SLAVE. And whence hath sprung such contest that our lives May suffer ere it end? LADICE. I will relate. For often did I hear when but a child My father's sire, the wise Amasis, tell How when he overthrew his tyrant king, And grasped himself the sceptre of this land, A herald of the Persian claim'd his child For King Cambyses' bride. Amasis scorn'd To place her by the fierce barbarian's side, But sent Nitetis deck'd with gems and gold, Daughter of Apries, the fallen king. She told the cheat that Persia might avenge Her father's fate, and in her line restore Imperial consequence. Meantime, a Greek, One Phanes, a deserter from our ranks, Urged King Cambyses to invade the shores Of Nile: the monarch entertain'd the prayer. SLAVE. But then Amasis died. LADICE. A conqueror's son, Cambyses takes delight in clash of spears. He hath no better motive to prolong This hated war. Oft in thy servitude Hast thou reveal'd thy fatal origin, How that thy mother was a sorceress And the strong gift of foresight could confer On the afflicted. This in lighter hours Hath been our theme: now hasten to her side, And pouring all my troubles in her ear Beseech the gift that I may see the scene Of Egypt's conflict, and discern our fate. SLAVE. Dost thou not fear that some dread penalty May be exacted by the righteous powers Should'st thou succeed in wresting from their book The secrets else conceal'd? LADICE. No punishment Equal in force to this inquietude Can be inflicted on me. SLAVE. Think once more! LADICE. Canst thou succeed with thy progenitress? SLAVE. I fear, too swiftly and too well. LADICE. Depart! Behold my Inaros at length appears. INAROS, LADICE. LADICE. Son of Piromis, loved Inaros! As often as I dare to look on thee, The pomps of state which uninvited throng Around me, vanish; or they stand apart Aw'd into distance by love's rivalry, Within whose pale life's sweetest memories Can only pass! and often in my need These spell-bind sorrow and divert its tears To channels of affection. INAROS. In those words I hear eternal blessings. LADICE. When of late I saw my brother armed to share the fight, And like my father mount the battle steed; When from the gates in solemn movement tramp'd The war-born cavalry; I wept aloud And thought of Inaros. INAROS. And from the field Hast thou no tidings? LADICE. None. INAROS. Then all is well. Were we to yield to timorous phantasy Our trouble-serving thoughts would rob the breast Of fond anticipation. Let us trust That when two kings behold each other's face A sense of innate majesty may stir The peaceful impulse: that alone decides The cause of justice. LADICE. It befits the great To tower above the passions of the world. INAROS. O my Ladice, let me see thine eyes! How soft, how beaming are they! As I gaze Their light glows into fire, they pierce my heart. Before I saw thy loveliness I sigh'd To gather pleasures from the flowery earth; I lov'd the world, the clime, the virgin sky, I lov'd myself! but when I saw thy face I ceas'd to know another universe. What I aspir'd to had not life like thee. It answer'd not my look, return'd no smile, And made to me no promise. I but guess'd Its meaning and believ'd it; thee I hear! LADICE. How often conscious of like solitude Would I in saddest peace of mind exclaim, What is there in this life's monotony? INAROS. The well known yesterday seem'd come again, The well known sense of being seem'd to fail. But now the hours chant rapture as they come; Sense of eternal harmony pervades Each form of thought which on affection dwells. We feel our love within each other's mind; And as in fond embrace our feelings meet A single sentiment of life involves Our earnest being! LADICE. Never shall we share The fondly looked-for future of our love In this sad earth; that heaven which to the mind Is given to be its everlasting home Is our sole hope; these animating hours But promise an affection which awaits Our lives beyond the tomb. INAROS. O let despair Haunt unbless'd souls; let its dismayful looks Affright not thee, thou source of clearest hope, Which in one stream thro' earthly dullness flows Into this glad receptacle, the heart. Repose in faith. Behold for thy proud sake Is sent a herald to the far-famed port Of the wave-girt Busiris, tranquil seat Of Isis' grandest fane, yet more sublime Than that whose column'd beauty on the coast Of Tyre, illumed by emerald pillar, soars, That there a sumptuous sacrifice be made In offering for thy welfare. Nor alone In that religious island, but at home Are offer'd up both hymns and sacrifice. LADICE. These things thy love suggested for my good; Nor can poor gratitude repay thy care. In thy enlighten'd sphere of piety, Thou hast not made omission of the land, Or its defenders. I before had heard Of these august proceedings, but would learn From thine own lips of this great sacrifice. INAROS. The prayer and fasting done, a chosen priest Fell'd to the earth a monstrous ox, and flay'd, And the warm entrails sever'd. Thro' the limbs And other sacred parts the knife he drew. Then o'er the mutilated trunk there stood The shaven youths, each bearing offerings. The one deposited his figs and grapes Within the carcase, one wild honey pour'd, A third brought bread made of the purest grain, And others follow'd with delicious choice Of aromatics, frankincense, and myrrh. These laid within the victim, from a vase Of glittering brass they pour'd the holy oil In plenteous stream, and sacrific'd in fire. Then as the sacred portions blaz'd, a rage Came o'er each face, else pious, and the breast Was beaten fiercely, till by penance sooth'd All gather'd to the feast. Great is the day! Myriads were here assembled; strangers brought Their dreadful usages from lands afar, That they their rites might mingle in the feast Of Isis Buceron. And to enhance The fervor of the scene, while yet the men, Who held the hereditary trust, their herds Drove off the Temenos, the river glow'd Beneath the laden barges under way To Atarbechis with the horn-deck'd bones: For there the remnants of the sacred bull Are gather'd to a consecrated spot. LADICE. Then all that man, feeble accomplisher, Can dare attempt, has been perform'd to-day. But stay! my eyes directed towards the shore, I see distinctly with prophetic gaze The hostile ranks assembled: each is still In stern defiance gazing on the foe. Behold in prelude to the threaten'd fight A band of Hellens rises on the field Pale with fast-breathing vengeance! They perceive The traitor Phanes foremost of the hordes Whom he hath led to his adopted land. That wretch stands out of the invader's line Contempt denoting in his distant smile. But now his look is stiffen'd, and his jaw Quivers and drops in terror. On our side The Greeks have led his little babes in view, Conceal'd before: these had the father left To confidential care. The innocents, Now naked, group'd before their parent's sight Are only heard to utter a shrill cry Piercing to human hearts: their pallid looks Instinct with childish dread of violence! The Greeks more harden'd on the traitor gaze: And now they draw across the infant's veins The Ethiopian stone. Tall as a shade, Relax'd and motionless the father stands; Nor do the dying innocents again Utter a cry; pale, shivering, resign'd! The Greeks in confirmation of their crime Now mix the blood, this moment shed, with wine, And as the horror of revenge attains Within their breasts the blackest consciousness, They drain the cup, and with their crimson lips Breathe in one voice a soul-appalling curse, And swear to conquer! INAROS. This is prophecy! These tidings give some respite to our fears LADICE. Behold the Persians, eager for the fight! They have known conquest only thro' a life Of hard-fought battles, and their triumphs ceas'd But when the conquer'd world assur'd their arms Of universal sway. Their leader sank Crown'd with the lasting honours of the earth Into his palace of eternal rest. His sword is blunted by the file of death, His arm reposes. His diviner part Hath fram'd a bright excursion to the seat Where lofty spirits pause, and look below On hope and strife as mortal attributes. The son of Cyrus, not less valiant, leads The courage of his armies which survives, Tho' render'd mighty by the mightier dead. Conscious of solemn purpose, day and night On the blue summit of Arabian hills Where neither altar stands, nor statued fate, The priesthood kneel in prayer for victory. With a tiara crown'd whose disc is wrought In myrtle leaves, the priest invokes his god, And uses nor libations, nor the sound Of pipes, nor wreathes the bybline leaf, but leads His victim to the lonely peak. By day With unabating zeal they sacrifice To the large circle of the heavens, and call On highest Zeus, and on the fiery sun And earth below; and as the night returns They solemnize the rites of Artemis, And Mitra who along the galaxy Reigns as a shepherdess beside her flock. Hark! they invoke, in piety sublime, The blessings of the gods, not on themselves, But on the king and all the Persian land. INAROS. How canst thou know these mysteries? LADICE. I see As if I stood amongst the motley crowd. Oh blind my eyes! great horrors smite their orbs, And force me to behold them. Turn away That scene of ruin, bring me to myself. Oh Doom! turn back and undermine the hours By which this morn is fashion'd; or desist From thy disastrous work! Oh Inaros! This day spreads an inevitable toil Whose fatal circle holds us; and the breath Of sweeping time now like a whirlpool comes To hurry all away. INAROS. Ladice! wake; Unclose those eyes which sudden frenzy binds. She sinks as into death's exhaustless sleep. Slaves bear Ladice to a couch. Terrace beside the Nile, between the Temple and the Palace. HOROS. Here let me pause a moment on myself 'Mid scenes of former hope to meditate. The lotos flower, which moveless on the brink Still gems this stream, whose circling flood protects The sacred ground, I watch'd in other days When not alone, 'neath yon worn pyramid While the grey clouds were gather'd round its spire As they are now. With what unwonted force Recur the pleasing features of that scene! Methought I saw her?âno, it was her look Started to life and faded in my soul. Ah! the spring season of my life is fled With all its flowers, the brilliant hues obscur'd Since she departed; and I hide myself 'Mid life's unvariegated foliage In mournful search of new and strange delights. In vain! for this deep wound there is no balm. Ambition seems the sole bright misery For my adoption; whether it may lead To honour or perdition, 'tis the same; Great souls were born to bear adversity. A memory written in my country's love I covet now, to sense of duty rous'd By sense of pain; tho' no reward this brings The broken heart but only mock delight. That which I was in the green leaf, I am; Not more advanc'd against my country's wrongs. My summer dawns, I triumph or I fall. Now, more and more the hours of my sweet prime, So bright when present, afar off appear, A twilight dimm'd by insubstantial shades Of past remembrance. She amid the gloom Flits from me, once regarded with such joy, But in the portrait as beheld again Enwrapt in sorrow. Still her loveliness Remains unsullied by adversity, That with intense affection as I gaze The murmurings of passion softly pause, And whisper at the heart deceptively Of bliss scarce tainted by an adverse thrill. Then let me break the fascinating charm Which from my spirit hath so long exil'd That longing for the unattain'd which feeds Upon our best successes, and declares Our nature ever greater than our fate. HOROS, INAROS. INAROS. O ever pensive Horos, from whose hand The crude existences of things return Formose and sightly! Do I find thee here Revolving in the mind what next thy art May render perfect, or thy faculty Of winning treasures of the wealthy heavens May do for mortals? HOROS. No, the task is o'er. I was that happy man who lov'd to court The disembodied beauties of the earth As they like milder fire escap'd the forms Of tangible creation: and their shapes Found like ideal statues in my mind A perfect order, while the distant worlds To them made tribute of their harmony. Those days sped by, another train appear'd More joyous, since responsive to the call Of passion which usurp'd the seat of thought. Then a deep bliss prevail'dâbut thou hast heard Of my bereavement! Years of agony Led me to contemplate the lot of man. Thus prompted, I began to analyse The things pertaining to my father-land, The rites of fanes, their obscure origin, The priest's belief, the nation's slavery. These in a balance pois'd were light as air; They fled the scourge of reason. INAROS. Hast thou weigh'd In the opposing scale the finite mind? 'Twere feeble to contend with things divine. And how subversive of thy fantasies Is the sure comfort souls discern in faith! View that despair which gathers round the hour Of dissolution! Then, our mortal part Has dread of death: but suddenly is hail'd An inward light which dissipates the gloom, And souls o'erwhelmed with holy rapture pray. HOROS. To ponder that I sought this sacred place, But oft deferr'd the task, until my thoughts In reverential mood at length approach'd The hallow'd theme. But ere the strife began To tempt myself into belief, I wept The bitter tears of incredulity. INAROS. Think of the lore of the Piromides Who fix'd the precepts of the gods on stone. Oh bend beneath their wisdom! HOROS. Born a sage, The rolls and hieroglyphs have I pursued To their last depth, to find vacuity. To nature's restoration then I pledge This spirit which enables me to mourn My country's degradation. INAROS. 'Midst thy toils, Hast thou forgot when early fellowship Link'd by its hallow'd law our tender hearts, And chain'd us into one? HOROS. Our wanderings Oft led us to the ruddy precipice Where nature's porphyry roll made legible The fabric of a world. And then we trod, With airy steps and finite arguments, The rocks where revolution oft hath strode, Till emblems rose before our wondering sight, Impersonations of the olden time Self-sculptur'd in the desert, as to warn Our thoughts against contention with the signs Of things inscrutable. Amid such scenes In those innocuous days in vain we tried The ancient mystery of the soul to scan. INAROS. Yes, then as even in maturer days, Hard seem'd the task imposed upon our minds For thought to analyse the source of thought. And still thou canst condemn the comely truths Reveal'd to the adopted sons of heaven; Canst live a worshipper at nature's shrine! The true belief is the select and pure Of nature, hallow'd by our piety; But first by heaven inspir'd. Then, enter here: The high Piromis, with parental love, Forgives for the last time thy heresy, And seeks but thy return to holiness. HOROS. Those generous sorrows which pervade mankind In their prosperity, infect him not In all his gloom. If thou wouldst please a foe, Name not the proud arch-enemy again. My path now long selected, not thy voice Can charm my ear with reason to retreat. INAROS. Thou canst impute no inward thoughts or deeds To the high priest, that, humbled, he should stand Amenable to mortal scrutiny. Wrong not the mighty, then, whom heaven affords The staff of intellect to prop his age. Those searching eyes that all things penetrate With super-human vision, and repel The damp, and sullying breath of noxious time, Now glare with more than youthful brilliancy Upon me; lo! my father's shadow stands As now I speak, before my mental sight In growing power, as if the gods had shown His spotless soul permission to appear And dissipate the slander. With me hence, The conclave summons thee. HOROS. I know their will Is not to be resisted. Then these gates I pass to cite no more the light of day In proof of truth. Oh heaven-taught liberty! Incomprehensible thy fate appears, To perish in the early age of time. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. The Temple. PIROMIS, HOROS, INAROS, AND CONCLAVE OF PIROMIDES. PIROMIS. In conclave here assembled to condemn The heresy of thy unlicens'd speech, And fatal deeds, we ask thee to recant Thy public vows, and henceforth live in peace. Why, Horos, hast thou grown so impious To rail with open hate against the will Of the Eternal? This severe reproach Is not of me, but issues from these powers Who sit in judgment on thy blasphemy. Why dost thou seek to scrutinize those truths Which mortal must not fathom? Look on me, The wreck of vain and persevering thought. I own sad secrets which man cannot hear, Nor I divulge, too startling to the fears Of those who in their aspect seldom bear The hope they feel. Thou too hast walk'd the earth The sole companion of a silent heart, While truth in cold and solemn earnestness Hath but reproach'd thy love: for years must fail, And age on age must roll ere light prevail. Would that I were, unless I ever be, In that great day, with equals circled round! My track is but ideal as I am, Tho' feeling what the future has to feel And sharing glories which exceed my own. How many thousand years before my time The debt of this existence is made due, This intellectual being; how obscure Is all around the self-illumin'd soul! And thou would'st seek the final cause which gave Thee being equal to the universe,â A lonely plan! Thou mayst attempt to solve The hidden meaning, but wilt ever find The problem of existence unresolv'd. I, a grey-headed worshipper, have pray'd For truths reveal'd not, but for ever lost In time's first sepulchre, whose eager gulph Hath swallow'd up the certitude of all, Or whence our being came, or whence the world. 'Tis here we find a limit to the soul Which wanders calmly thro' the systems wide Only to doubt; for what illusive dream To thought can reconcile eternity? These mysteries to fathom, have I spread The subtle faculty of vision round The vast expanse, mantling the cluster'd stars In intellectual light, tho' but to feel A glow equivalent; to only learn That thro' the universe content prevails And all save man is happy! Nature's soul Beyond her present purpose unendow'd, Nor with fore-knowledge curs'd like us in vain, Knows not to question her own safe career. If she then be immortal, is not man Who wonders whence this speechless ecstasy Which permeates creation, and affects The human spirit with a thrill divine? And thence a reigning piety prevails In human hearts, and man has ever lov'd To visit the abodes of those who dwell In hallow'd fanes beneath the shade of heav'n. HOROS. O thou proud priest, think of thy father-land, Is it not lost? to think that it should be In such an age as that which boasts thy name! Thou who wast delegated from above With ample power to stamp the nation's brow With thy mind's aristocracy! Instead In barter for thy vile idolatry, O lucre-hearted serpent! would'st thou strip The poor man of his earnings! Thro' thy deeds Is Egypt, from whose giant sons have sprung The nations, in her moral growth cut off; Her course of human ancestry is run; The fountains of her unpolluted blood Must be absorbed in the o'erwhelming flood Toss'd from barbaric shores. PIROMIS. Thy wisdom dreams. We should unite our sever'd influence To save the land: or rather in thy youth Shoulds't thou yield to the elders. If thy pride Require a higher guide behold the king! He thinks for millions, and his intellect Pervades their vacant sense with more effect Than if th'assembled people felt concern'd In their own safety. HOROS. Cease thy sophistry! My eyes are lighted at thy crystal heart, I see inside, unwelcome is the sight. Thou art endow'd with gifts so manifest Men dare not analyse thy moral course. Yet art thou less than mighty! Rules design'd By predecessors bind thee to thy place. Beyond the vulgar enterprise of dust, Thou should'st ascend into untrodden paths, And test the moral attributes and plans Of the untaught, the ever-teaching power. PIROMIS. All actions perish with the passing time. Give not the import of eternity To things of but a day. HOROS. Oh idle thought! Dost thou forget that all eternity Cannot efface the memory of an hour? Then since the meanest periods concur To form that sum of time whereto we fix Our aspirations, would'st thou desolate These first foundations of futurity With recollected crime? The present hour Is the sole heritage that we possess; We are but heirs of that which is to come. PIROMIS. The truths of Isis rather deem a cure For the disasters of an earthly lot. HOROS. The unmask'd truth is falsehood's only balm. Thy eloquence, thy looks of piety, The benefits of station, these have crush'd The pensive faculty, which grown so poor, Now seeks for comfort at its fount of woe. There is a star which from the night of heaven Looks calmly on this earthly paradise, And lures the credulous from present toil Into a mighty future, to descry Amid the myriads of happy worlds One blissful hope. And they who watch that star Forget their woes, and mounting on fond thought, As if the spirits of a better sphere, Receive its joys before their future comes. But while their troubles change to happiness In watching that one star that seems so bright And blessed to their eyes, they do not hear The groans which rise into its atmosphere; Nor, heedless of each other's miseries, They feel, thus far away, a sympathy For sorrows there conceal'd. It is a world Where in delicious order rang'd are found Oceans, and isles, and continents, whose soil Cultur'd by ceaseless spring appears the source Of all things beautiful. The verdant grass Border'd by foliage which might yield a couch For spirits to repose their weary wings, Waves as the air may move, and in the sun Bower'd fountains open to distil the cool Of even, and afford their chequer'd shades To pilgrims on the way, alas! which leads To better worlds. For this is not a place Of peace, save to the deluge of sweet flowers Varied with leaves, and fruits which nectar pour, A never ending vintage. Every scene Has its horizon of delicious light, So luring all rush forward full of hope To reach the azure way which still recedes As fast as they advance, and still attracts The vain pursuit. Within this lovely world The disappointed spirits ever long To see the morrow dawn: in indolence, Surrounded by the tiresome hours, they watch The sun, and weary of themselves, still bear The burden of a mind. And while self-love Administers to hope, the reverend minds Of the illustrious old whose age there grows Immortal, bear their majesty in vain, For no respect is paid to their hoar locks, No listening ear to their philosophy. They live desiring to diffuse those streams Of wisdom which bring home unto the heart Its peace; but none obedient to their voice, The weary waters to their fount divine Flow back, and no fertility rewards The sage's arduous toil. There roams all day The lover of creation to expend His heart in study of her various plants And their spring bloom, but with elated breast No sooner touches he the prospering leaf Than all the vernal foliage withering droops. Among these scenes the noble patriot Lives, as in exile, ready every hour To sacrifice his life. There none have hearts Whose feelings counterpoise the weight of life. Those are most happy who in trouble find Excitement, draining poetry from tears To imitate content. Forgive me, priest, That I compare thy goddess to this star. PIROMIS. The holy conclave of Piromides Condemns thee to a prison in the fane. There lies the way which leads to it; depart! If in the gloom inclosed thou should'st permit Thy fancy to depict a last abode Look not too far for an inhabitant. The time is come to contemplate thy end. Horos is led away. My son, hath yet the messenger return'd From Buto, where Latona's oracle Lives in communion with pervading doom INAROS. Along the palmy avenue he comes. PIROMIS. His answer may decide the prisoner's fate The voice is human but the sense divine. Enter a Messenger. We here await the oracle's decree. MESSENGER. These are the words in solemn accents told: âThe day that Horos prematurely dies, Thy temple, Isis, in wide ruin lies.â PIROMIS. Depart, the holy conclave is dissolv'd. Enter a Soldier. SOLDIER. Holy Piromis, and ye reverend priests, Haste to the palace. Egypt's shatter'd force Throngs into Memphis. Close upon the rear The Persians press; their heralds are arriv'd To claim the city. Hasten to the king. PIROMIS. Fear not, but put thy trust in heaven, we come. The Palace. PSAMMENITOS, LADICE, ANYSIOS, SIUPHIS, CHILON, EGYPTIANS, &amp;c. PSAMMENITOS. My spirit! still unvanquish'd by thy cares, Rejoice in thy affection for a child From birth beloved till now. Grief calms her eyes, Sorrow is on her cheek, tho' I am come! Is this to greet my unsuccessful arms? LADICE. O heaven, remove this curse of prophecy! PSAMMENITOS. In what strange speech doth she address herself? LADICE. O my great father, perhaps this pallid look Hath not received its ransom of the past In whose sad service I enroll'd myself, Willing to take the sleepless watch at home. PSAMMENITOS. Yet had the past been worse, it now were o'er. The terrors of the present hourly cease, And human nature's best philosopher, Is laughter seated at the bed of wo To watch her coming end. And tho' her heirs Press forward, and lay claim to their entail, They too fall sick: so fatal to possess On such a tenure as the present hour. Then fear not for the past, but forward peep Thro' the bright curtain of futurity. That which is past hath no external being, A ghost imprison'd in the memory To act no further part. The hand points on! Then rush not down the precipice of time Where shadows find no walls to stretch upon, But let the future pause upon thy soul. It holds of prospects an unbounded store, With means of triumph, fame, and victory. LADICE. Where is my slave! hath she forsaken me? O heaven remove this curse of prophecy! PSAMMENITOS. What doth she mutter thus in mystery? LADICE. The greatness of thy soul can never fail To lead thee on to glory. PSAMMENITOS. All at last Must fail, but, let me perish when I may, I will not bring dishonour on that tomb Where monarchs sway the silence of deep death, And, stretch'd in awful majesty, inspire With royal hope Time's mystical delay. Should Egypt perish with me, her old name Shall not depart the land; her mighty lake, Her fanes, her death-exalting pyramids, Her awful tombs, and spell-bound deities, Are here eternal, and tho' left alone, Save by the Nile's discoursing sympathy, Will look with crushing aspect on the wretch Of other climates and less daring homes. Hast thou Piromis summon'd from the fane To meet in instant council? SIUPHIS. All the priests Dispersing from the conclave hasten here, Pale at disastrous tidings. PSAMMENITOS. Then, my son, Conduct thy sister to a place of rest. Anysios and Ladice depart. Who can arrest the flood of destiny? The weary pulse of nature which connects The sluices of my life, by links unseen, Unto the outward destinies of kings, Does violence within. I feel that doom Encircles me. The messenger of death Has warn'd me from the sepulchre to fear For self-appointed rulers. Yes, I feel Our name is silent in the haughty past. The dead whence we descended, unforewarn'd Of our great rise, recorded not their names But sleep apart from glory. So our pomp And pride is centred in ourselves alone. PIROMIS, and Priests enter. PSAMMENITOS. Admit the Greek ambassadors to kneel Before our throne. Enter Ambassadors. Courageous messengers! We cede ye liberty of speech. AMBASSADORS. Oh king! Cambyses, son of Cyrus, whom we serve Ordains that thou should'st render up in peace The city. PSAMMENITOS. These were scarce their master's words. They have indulged in revels, and their speech, Perverted by the magic of the feast, Betrays them into treason. Lead them hence. Capture their vessel, and secure the crew. CHILON. Pause yet an instant, awful sovereign! PSAMMENITOS. Priests, sages, warriors, the flower and pride Of this great land! 'tis said that in our port A ship, with Hellens mann'd, at anchor rides The tossing flood, awaiting our reply To some strange mandate that we yoke no more The fiery war-horse to the chariot, But lay our freedom at the victor's feet, And urge his clemency. Who can have heard This message and preserv'd tranquillity? To meet reverses, and encounter ills, Has been, in golden days, the soldier's lot; But, 'mid the hazards of disastrous war, When all seem'd adverse, did my father save This empire from destruction. In those days Imperial sway grown careless of its power, The sceptre was transferr'd to firmer hands, Long held by a grey-headed dynasty. Where Memphis as a sister stands beneath Our native pyramids, once flow'd the Nile, Till wondrous toil diverted from its bed The sacred stream, uprais'd the city walls, And form'd yon lake of the redundant flood, Lake MÃ¦ris, whose extent is like a sea. From yonder date majestic ages sprang; And a bright race of crowned heroes rose In bright succession, aided in their deeds By sages, and ancestral warriors, And, above all, the pure Piromides, Who, by the light accorded from on high, Founded in heaven a starry sepulchre For our last breath. With such an origin, And bearing all the honours of our race, Are we so weak as tacitly to yield Our dear inheritance? No voice replies! Arise, ye dreadful warriors, let me hear Your truth-instilling lessons, wisely claim'd Of the historic past, if there remain The man who yet hath fortitude to hold A beacon to the future. SIUPHIS. Solemn king! Impose not censure on these speechless forms. This is the burning silence of revenge. Shouts such as rend the welkin in our dreams Upon the field of war, rang in our ears; But as each soul diffus'd them, he forgot His voice to others should be audible. In silent speech rapt the war-council sat: The spell is broken! Is it not a law Of this existence that determin'd minds Gain strength by their reverses to perform Deeds else not made the subject of a dream? That law our guide, no mortal enemy Have we to fear; and should the blessed gods Ordain our courage useless here below, We meet with glory in an after-world. PSAMMENITOS. Then first, what fate assign ye to the Greeks Who bring this insult hither? SIUPHIS. They must die. How great were they with Persian consequence; And how their lofty manner signified That this was conquer'd land! For this they dieâ Not for their office, but their fearless looks. CHILON. Siuphis, why insult a royal mind Whose policy was never to exceed The rules of war, or openly transgress The laws of nations? should a fresh defeat Succeed such crimes, is there a neighbouring state Would aid us outlaw'd by cold-blooded deeds, And infamous for acts of cruelty? So far O king! I plead for honor's sake, An urgent monitor; now let me name My services, tho' poor; I am a Greek, And love my long-neglected countrymen. Their only error is fidelity. To-day this empire is a mighty one, But what does this avail? Futurity Holds a commission to avenge the past! If thou would'st conquer let a kingly thought Move thy clench'd features to relenting smiles, That first on thy high brow may shine the light Of self-won conquest. PIROMIS. That which I would say I speak in parable, convinc'd meantime No foe should find indulgence in this land. There is a place in rocky Araby Whence the wing'd serpents issue on their flight, At earliest spring, to fertilizing Nile. But in their passage thro' the long defile Of mountain crags, behold, the fighting bird Black Ibis, vulture-bill'd, in myriads Destroys them near their entry to the plains, Where their bleached spines collect in pyramids. And hence in Egypt these crane-legged fowl Are most esteem'd of all the feather'd tribe. The sacred bird may be thy monitor. But to the disaffected people give The work of death, that they the more may dread The triumph of the rude barbarians, And meet the foe with obstinate despair. PSAMMENITOS. Thy subtle policy is good. They die. PIROMIS. Still on the face of this great argument The cause of Egypt's loss hath not appear'd. PSAMMENITOS. Religious nature so ordain'd her laws, That priests should be the wisest of mankind. The ear of gods is patient to their prayer. 'Tis well, for in the hallow'd conference Of soul and elder Immortality, The forms are awful save to purest minds. Why then was lost the battle? To the throne Of watchful Isis whose high minister Thou art below, make thou thy offering. Then may the cause approach thy pious mind, Presented in the image of a thought Before thy reason. For, O Priest, I know That by no sudden miracle is wrought Thy wondrous skill, but thro' accustom'd laws. As nature here, so nature 'yond the sky. PIROMIS. The cause was manifest in yonder fane Ere, blindly, thou didst gather to the field Thy conquer'd armies. PSAMMENITOS. Let it be reveal'd. PIROMIS. There is a sage of Memphis who perverts The use of nature's gifts with a desire To overthrow the servants of the gods. As thou didst fear to crush this heresy, How couldst thou look for other than defeat? PSAMMENITOS. Should Horos suffer death, thou well mightst fear Nitetis, link'd to him by ties of love, Lest she, the instigator of this war, Should swifter bring her armies on thy fane. PIROMIS. Entrust his doom to the Piromides. PSAMMENITOS. Not as thou wilt, but listen to my speech. Latona's monolythic temple stands At Buto on the margin of the lake, Where Chemmis laden with her palmy groves Floats unrestrain'd by the subaqueous soil. Send thither, and enquire the will of heaven. PIROMIS. In thy defeat the will of heaven is known. PSAMMENITOS. Do as thou wilt, I yield him to thine hands. The Priests depart. PSAMMENITOS, SIUPHIS, CHILON. PSAMMENITOS. With yesterday the hope of Memphis fell. Disgraced, defeated, wounded to the soul, The army here returns, and it presents A remnant only of the host which left A well-appointed force in bright array. The spears, which like a forest mov'd along, Now, as the axe had fell'd them, grounded rest Against the weary arms of pensive men; And downward hangs the drooping warrior's head. Let me invoke the latent energies Of each unconquer'd soul to render up What means of providence may yet remain To meet the coming danger, and let loose Such terrors on our else unmarshall'd fears As discipline despair. Pause not an hour. This moment at our gates the conqueror Fraught with unquench'd ambition may surprise Th'unwary sentinel, and sleeping troops. CHILON. My King, the fervour of a Greek forgive That he oppos'd thy councils: thou art just! PSAMMENITOS. I lov'd thy fervour, and thou art forgiven. Chilon, descend into the palace court, Now fill'd with soldiers; thou their numbers lead Tow'rds the great pyramids to meet the foe, There march them to the sounds of victory. For after absence from their native plain, A spot so fill'd with antique majesty Will thrill a chord of honour in their breasts, And whisper what they were. And thou my friend! Siuphis, the most favour'd of my court, Companion of my board in brightest days, Collect the barks of Memphis as a guard On the broad river whose parental flood Protects the gates of this metropolis. Appoint thou also messengers to Thebes, That all possessing lands and fit to hold The battle-axe and wear the crested helm, May hasten hither; and that capital Warn with a saving angel's eloquence To rise in arms against the Persian powers. CHILON alone. Then that must be which cannot be revers'd. But these world-cresting pyramids shall pass To other hands, and liberty no more Shall view the monuments of its own soil. Soon shall the pipes accordant to the dirge Of Maneros, awaken woman's grief; And woman with her bosom wildly bar'd, And waist ungirdled, shall in sorrow beat Her breast, and utter, Memphis is no more! For the last time the priests, to awe mankind, Shall bear the painted corse before the feast, And warn men to be merry for a day! Henceforth shall all behold this boasted Nile, Where river horses gambol round the barge, And crocodiles with open jaws observe The fragile forms of men,âas wretched slaves. The golden phÅnix spreads his scarlet plumes No more for Heliopolis; nor brings His father, rapt in myrrh, from Araby To bury 'neath the temple of the Sun. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. A Chamber of the Temple. HOROS. The solemn shade of this deep fane, beyond Whose walls I am permitted not to stray, Darkens my heart, and pierces with a chill That still august retreat of lonely hope. O never may the river which I hear Murmuring outside my prison, bend its neck Beneath a foreign yoke; or lofty tow'rs Of Nile-lav'd Memphis raise a victor's sight To the yet loftier pyramids! Consign'd To this dread edifice I look around, And by the massive gloom of my abode Repuls'd, my spirit traverses the world, By memory licensed to retrace my steps Thro' street and palace, but whose avenues End not this lengthen'd pilgrimage of woe. Nitetis! could'st thou hear of my distress, Thou would'st thy fallen ancestors bewail, Who honour'd sleep in their ancestral tomb. They would have succour'd me, have left at large A mind by habit pleas'd with all that pass'd, If it were pure! O strange doth it appear That virtue was not meant to triumph long, But only to delight its poor possessor! Ere nature's law-giver impress'd his code Upon the mind, did he neglect to view The vision his omniscience pourtray'd? Or truth had worked to a successful end! Hark! the forth-rolling echo of a voice Murmurs its dying terrors in my ears! A VOICE. Vengeance is nigh! revenge, revenge, revenge! HOROS. A living cavern opens wide its depths To utter terrors; thro' the sounding walls And deep resounding domes, the yell of hate Rolls in articulate thunder; every way Sound follows sound; the shaking galleries Are not yet still. A VOICE. Revenge, revenge is nigh! HOROS. Again, and still afar, the voice is heard, And what affrighted first, now awes my soul. The dreadful threat drives like a hurricane Of super-human power my calmer thoughts Into their den, and at their alter'd looks My inward being shudders. Is the threat Directed at my breast? A VOICE. The streets to-day Shall be thy altar; human forms as thick As death upon the field of war, shall be Thy victims, reeking in a pool of gore. HOROS. A woman's tongue is this made shrill by anguish. Her footstep presses near, she smites the doors! A VOICE. Horos! HOROS. That voice hath a familiar tone. Now calm'd, it strikes upon a secret tract Of memory which word of other tongue Might seek to thrill in vain. Within me now The well of first affection feels its depths, Which had been tranquil as the inky flood, Perturb'd; its now hot current to the wound Inside my breast brings welcome agony. NITETIS, HOROS. HOROS. I never did anticipate this hour Or this embrace! come nearer, yet more near. O sadness! centre of a thousand joys Let this re-union of dissever'd hearts Be thy release! to airy sympathy Dissolve, a feeling to me long denied! Nitetis! darkness severs yet our eyes. Then place my hand upon thy regal brow, That I may touch its round and polish'd shape, Nor feel the furrows of adversity. Smile, tho' it be in sorrow, and compose Thy features into light. Why dost thou weep, Why tremble in my arms? NITETIS. Tho' this dark world The past hath not so alter'd that no charm Gleams on us from its prospects, or calm seat Is seen afar where pensive love may cull The bliss its melancholy sense desires; I come not here to claim a lover's vows, But give release to thee, that thou mayst see The hand of retribution soften'd down Into a woman's! More than love I come To share; thou shalt partake in my revenge. HOROS. It shall not be! tho' vengeance may subdue It cannot vanquish evil. Nature gave A sword to justice, not of two-edg'd steel, But fire, which knows to pierce the vicious soul. Nitetis! when I sigh'd with thee in youth I ventur'd on my passion to depend, And claim'd of guardian nature all my wealth To stake on thee. And then I conjur'd up The mighty writ which summon'd me to be, And read to thee the treasures it conferr'd On its possessor. These to thee I gave, Gave thee my being! What has since transpir'd We know too well, nor let me tear afresh, In utterance, the immedicable wound. And is all this, the noble memory, The virtuous grief, to perish in revenge? How cam'st thou hither thus mysteriously? Despite thy claims, my gloomy soul forebodes. NITETIS. Thou hast demanded how I hither came, And I will answer; it was with the king. Cambyses sits on the Egyptian throne. Behold me queen of these my native realms, While the usurper of my father's rights Is captive in the monolythic house His predecessor built. The porch at Sais, Whose pillars stood like living palms, the tomb Amasis in mock glory fill'd, is rais'd; He disinterr'd, dishonour'd, scourg'd, and burn'd. His son, the stern Psammenitos, endures A punishment scarce less detestable, Save that the living may survive their shame, To reap new triumphs o'er their enemies. The great usurper, now in base attire Is dragg'd into the suburbs, that his soul May writhe in torture! Now, before him walk His children, dress'd as slaves with water-jugs, And by him stand his lords in filthiest vests, While to and fro their sons and daughters pace, Degraded to the dust. HOROS. That lofty king Hath been my sole protector. NITETIS. Strange to tell, The monarch calmly bends him to the earth; Nor sheds a tear to see his children weep At their base ignominy. All besides Have found their souls engulph'd in bitter woe. HOROS. Then hath the city yielded up its strength? NITETIS. Chilon gave up the city to our hands, For which he hath refused our recompense, And passed the flood to his Ionian soil, Sad at the thought of home. Into my hands He left his vengeance: and my faithful vow Piromis! was not register'd in heaven To only blot the page of destiny With name of traitors! Horos, thou art free. HOROS. Has not the priest a watch around the fane To mar escape, until the oracle Pronounce my doom? NITETIS. The priest hath heard its voice âThe hour that Horos prematurely dies Thy temple, Isis, in wide ruin lies.â HOROS. That solves the meaning of a short delay: The priest with death had threatened me! NITETIS. With death! He did withhold the oracle's decree. Ah! the light rushes on me. Thou shalt find In me no slow avenger of thy wrongs. HOROS. Crush not Piromis in his adverse hour, Though he deserve no good of thee! NITETIS. Alas! That which I am he made me. Even thou Knowest not a royal spirit's agony When cast from high estate to slavery. With so great sorrow but the fallen gods, Or monarchs doomed to wander from their homes, Can bend in sympathy. HOROS. Thou art unjust. Look on this pensive brow which tells the hours, The nights, the days, the years that I have spent In grief for thee; and still within is fixed The stern necessity to meditate, Without the soothing presence of a tear To dash the earth in emblem of despair. When once a curse hath lighted on the soul, 'Tis scarr'd for ever! NITETIS. I may serve thee yet. HOROS. Noâyet thou may'st: Piromis should be free. He is too old to die by violence. His lamp I would see quenched but when the sun Withdraws all light from his unwaking eyes. NITETIS. It is thy first request, and it shall be. Still is there left for him a punishment. In Front of the Temple. CAMBYSES, NITETIS, PSAMMENITOS, SIUPHIS, INAROS, NOBLES. CAMBYSES. Nitetis, thou indeed hast led our arms Into a fertile land. Beneath these palms Which flank the sacred avenue, I swear That Persia's line shall here be ever fixed! Ye who best know your native provinces, Relate through what unconquered plains this Nile Descends; its source, and when it overflows. Where is Piromis? hath not my command Enforced obedience? He was summon'd here. INAROS. I am his son. He sends me with these words: Piromis can obey no earthly power. CAMBYSES. Him next my burning anger shall chastise. NITETIS. The priests know best the records of the soil. Son of a rebel traitor, thou reply To what thy father, were he here, might tell. Trace through its course the passage of the Nile. INAROS. But who hath reach'd the mountain heart whence gush The streams of Nile? It distant is conceal'd In nature's bosom, 'yond Tachompso's isle, Between us and whose lake-encircled palms Rise cliffs precipitous on either side Over the sombre flood; and he who dares To scale this rushing torrent glides beyond Thro' rock entangled waves, at length to pause Beneath two mountains which their viewless peaks Hide in the liquid unsupported sky. These at their cincture open to the day Two fountains whose unending depths conceal A crystal emblem of eternity. For, at the confines of the earth controll'd, They pierce the globe-encircling stream whence seas And rivers take their earliest draught, by name Oceanus, and by whose mystic swell Is caused the yearly flooding of the Nile At summer solstice. Then the glassy plain Asserts its kindred with the town-gemm'd waves Of the Ãgean; no dry land relieves The mounded cities which stand out as isles; And the gaunt pyramids afar appear To walk the deep. And now in store are laid The tamarisk door, which tow'd the vessel down, And tide resisting millstone, which was slung Astern, and cheerily the sailor sets His bybline sails, and steers for many a port As o'er a sea. CAMBYSES. And my victorious troops Shall penetrate to whence these waters flow. Let the procession re-commence its march. Why are those warriors wet with dropping tears? Do they lament the spectacle which moves So solemnly along, the noblest youth, Even their own offspring, chain'd as slaves, and march'd To greet with dread the executioner? Or rather they, alas! too late repine At the untimely murder of my Greeks, Whom they condemn'd to sudden death unheard. Thou sullen king inform me why they sob? Silent and tearless still art thou! Behold, In yonder temple's porch th' uplifted axe Removes ten heads for every Greek that fell. Thy children last shall die to hope prolong In thy stern breast, that thou may'st last exclaim, Now am I childless, bare, and destitute! No axe the burden of thy life shall move. LADICE. Where is my slave! hath she forsaken me? O heaven, remove this curse of prophecy! Inaros drags Ladice from the procession. INAROS. Is this a victim suited to a king? Look at the fearful anguish which is fix'd On these resign'd and glassy eyes, the tears By new emotion pour'd, the bitter sob, The feeble scream, O heaven the lifeless frame! Lifeless! she never shall revive again! Thus nature's final act I meditate. O die unconsciously, nor let thine eyes Expand to look on death; oh! blessed end! Stabs her. LADICE. Slave of my thoughts, too faithful servitor, Who with thy art encirclest innocence; Tear the prophetic veil, release this brow From spells too deep for maiden sight to bear. What are these horrors, whence do they appear? Gore-stain'd! O Inaros, I cannot die! Look at the fate-recording scroll of heaven! The stars, to thee invisible, repeat My weary task of deeds not all perform'd. But love is there unnumber'd! She rushes into the Temple. INAROS. Hath she fled? O let me follow! NITETIS. Stay the murderer! INAROS. For but a moment! let me close her eyes, And then bring back my life! CAMBYSES. Why stand ye thus? Pierce the offender with a thousand swords! NITETIS. Stay! lay not thy hands upon him, spare the youth, Or I am lost! CAMBYSES. What sayst thou? NITETIS. He must live! Secure him; but my motives ask not here. CAMBYSES. Can parent glory in a murder'd child? See ye the smile of irony which moves The monarch; is there triumph in a slave, The basest, poorest of all creeping life? It seems there is, then smite him with thy hand. Why doth yon mendicant approach the king? Ah! is his lordly pride at last subdued? For see, he hides his face beneath his garb. Altho' unmov'd he saw his children led To suffer death, and coldly sacrificed The one whom most he lov'd. SATRAP. Why dost thou weep? CAMBYSES. He hears, and scorns to answer! Mendicant, If thou hast knowledge of his nature, try To solve the deep Ånigma of his wo. SIUPHIS. He mourns to see the man who shar'd his board, Reduced to this condition: see my bonds! I was his dearest friend, and in his court I held an envied place ere misery Thus plac'd a gulph between us. CAMBYSES. Thou art false! Why was he not tormented at the sight Of children, nearer to his love than thou, In abject slavery? SIUPHIS. Because his woe Was then too great for tears. CAMBYSES. Now do I know His royal nature. Give to him a robe Of finest cloth, respect him as a king. And hasten ye my satraps to the porch, Lead back his son, if still the youth survive, That he may know his father's mighty love. INAROS. Then have I slain the lovely innocent Whom now, too late, her destiny would spare. Give me the sword that kissed her gentle heart, That with less gentle hand I may immerse Its now repenting point into the seat Of my affliction! NITETIS. Stay his rash attempt. And now a solemn vow to Chilon made, To end Piromis' and Siuphis' days, Recurs: the first shall know, what vengeance is When born of woman! Mendicant! approach. Since king Cambyses honors thus his foes, Thou shalt no longer be in slavery. SIUPHIS, aside. Ripe grows the plot to prove thy prophecy. NITETIS. Siuphis, for thy master's sake be free. Drink of this cup, 'twill cheer thy drooping heart. He drinks, and soon will know its bitterness. SATRAP. As breathless I arriv'd Anysios fell! No child is left unslain to fill his arms. CAMBYSES. Distressful tidings! Let me go and mourn. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Night. A storm. Front of the Temple. INAROS. LADICE. INAROS. Oh! if that form be thou, those accents thine, Speak of thyself alone. LADICE. Haste, haste away, Since thou again art free. We meet once more; Then shalt thou place Ladice 'neath a mound Form'd of the sand which the now raging storm Hath wafted from the desert: let the peace Which covers the untrodden wilderness Where life is not, be her long epitaph! She did forsee what hand would shed her blood. She now fortells that thine too must be shed If thou remain'st an instant. Haste away! Follow the path which from this avenue Will lead thy footsteps to the river's bank. There wilt thou find a tongue to guide thee. INAROS. Stay! Pale, spectral prophetess! explain thy words. LADICE. Hast thou not heard? then all is lost! Fly hence, And question not my weakness, for these lips Cannot repeat their sentence, or explain Their swift inexplicable fluency. I am the vessel of unfathom'd truths Utter'd, but not recorded! Ah! I feel Myself urged on to act another part. Now burns the character in figur'd light Before my eyes, and impulse leads me on. SIUPHIS. Here am I left! O earth support my frame! What did Nitetis whisper in my ear? To think of Chilon to my latest hour? And dared she mock me with the traitor's name? For this my hand shall grapple with her heart Until its roots are snapp'd within her! Gods! Some poison works inside me, as a fire I inly burn. O death, starv'd skeleton, Come to thy courtier, let him hug thy neck! Can no one hear the dying sufferer's voice? Here, faint he lies, scarce sensible of life Or light of day, with but the canopy Spread out across the pallor of his brow. And when a lucid interval arrives With sense of pain, too feebly he exclaims For succour; still he calls and finds no help. SIUPHIS. PIROMIS. SIUPHIS. Water! PIROMIS. Where have they led my son? SIUPHIS. Be kind, And spare my breath till thou hast quench'd its fire. PIROMIS. Thy worldly appetites alone survive To death encounter! When the soul itself Is burn'd and parch'd by passion, it is well To sip the fountain of oblivion. But it behoves us in the hour of death To sink in spiritual tranquillity. Had he the aspiration to forget His mortal ills, and think beyond the grave Of the vast scene to open on his eyes, My soul in torrents of benevolence Should gush on his; but I can keep no faith With the poor driveller, humanity. I may be plung'd in error, but a cause For why hath nature planted in my heart; Nor shall a thought or deed of mine be chang'd. The moral history of the universe Was writ ere yet creation came to pass. Can he condemn who knows why all things are? He passes on to the temple. SIUPHIS, HOROS. SIUPHIS. Water! oh sage! HOROS. Stay, not far hence the rock Yields sweet abundance; thither will I haste. SIUPHIS. I know the face, tho' from my memory The forms of life are fleeting fast away. HOROS. Thus I return. Let this thy thirst assuage. SIUPHIS. Oh! is that wish sincere, or is the voice Feigned to the music of celestial love? HOROS. He sips not nature's pure medicament, But falls asleep, perhaps no more to dream. I will approach the river. Egypt's law Apportions sacred honours to the tomb Of him who breathes his last beneath that flood. The dire events on which the day hath closed Have proved my destined function at an end. Henceforth were life a vision of the past, A picture of enacted miseries. The sympathy I cherished till to-day, Hath from its gentle shape to monstrous chang'd; It clings to me with hideous grasp, and threats To end me with its fondness. The great hope To aid my country hath assumed a form Of dread reality; and now, too late, I learn that errors sacred to the world, When suddenly corrected, must entail The ruin of all good and useful things. But now that Discord hath asunder torn The links of good and evil, if, perchance, The words Latona's oracle pronounc'd By strange coincidence should be fulfill'd, Death crowns with bitter triumphs, which in life I failed to reap. Arise thou form of night, Spread thy oblivious wings, and hide from view The murmuring waters! Ye contending winds Instruct in unknown tongues death's auditor, That he may learn his path across the flood. Arise ye winged lightnings, throw your forms Along my dark horizon; and thou blaze Of meteor cease not with thy birth, but drop Thy light into the deep! From rock to rock How the dread thunder echoes; while beneath The earth, with floods contending, sends afar The hollow moans of desolating might! Take thy last leave, my fate directed soul, Of nature, clothed in all her elements! Ye meet no more, save in the memory Of the eternal one who gave to be. SIUPHIS. The fiend approaches: let me lie conceal'd. NITETIS, SOLDIER, SIUPHIS. NITETIS. Thou fearful night, thou storm-expressive heaven, And lightning flashing by the vengeful face Of the Eternal One! if woman's soul By birth to mildness temper'd, by itself Swoln to the deadliest hatred of its foes, Be worthy of associates so dire, She gives it ye in blackest sympathy. Ye lightnings fall, and round her bitter smile Wreathe your bright flames, and hurl the thunderbolt, The furies sceptre, at her feet! The flame Shows me a corpse borne on the troubled flood: A signal that my vengeance shall succeed. Piromis lives; the pleading gentleness Of the divine-made Horos hath prevail'd: But did Nitetis vow to spare his child? On to the prison, soldier, secretly Put Inaros to death. The corpse obtain'd, Bring it before the temple. There arriv'd Address the priest, say that the shroud enfolds The corpse of Horos; then reveal his son. Now to the bloody purpose, lose no time. This day the priest shall see his line extinct, And he in lonely pride shall live to mourn, If there be life in tomb-desiring sorrow! SIUPHIS, INAROS. SIUPHIS. Hast thou escaped? Then shall her wicked plots End in a harmless hurricane of hate. The dying man is merciful. I feel A mild compassion for thy cruel race, Within this almost vacant seat of life; But not for her who in this mortal breast Hath fixed the cursed signal to decay! Distemper'd woman! If I yet can drag This form of clay, which grows at every breath More cumbrous, but as far as yonder fane, I will disturb the system of thy schemes. O give me but the creeping energy Which to the tomb-discussing worm belongs, And I will mock thy venom! Creep thou arm, Which yesterday was winged to smite the air, In whose exalted region moved the spears Of heroes equal in renown to death; Creep, and by midnight shall thy journey end. INAROS. What do I hear thee utter, wretched man? Wretched perhaps as I! SIUPHIS. Approach my side; Bend thine ear towards me; thou shalt find in me A traitor to the interests of the grave. Believe the utterance of the dying! INAROS. Ha! Can this be true? Is she so pitiless? Ladice! let me bless thy guardian soul! SIUPHIS. Begone, and hide thy body till the morrow, Into whose distant hour no eye can pierce. Begone, and shut thy body up: thy life, On whose defenceless incorporeal mould Nor plated helm, nor armour can repose, May else with ineffectual struggle meet Th' assassin steel. INAROS. I will retrace my steps To those dark labyrinths thro' which I cross'd My prison to the fane. SIUPHIS. Thy life be sav'd! Enter a SOLDIER. A thought on my expiring genius dawns, And it shall prove of deeper bitterness To queen Nitetis, than if her own soul Recoil'd in enmity against itself! SOLDIER. 'Tis said that Inaros, who hath escap'd His prison, fled into this avenue. SIUPHIS. My friend, ere yet too late, from this black flood Rescue the floating body of the priest. There Inaros, Piromis' son, hath sought A dreadful refuge from his enemies. Soldier approaches the river. The gods be prais'd that he believes the tale. PSAMMENITOS. The vision of an empire moves away Before my sight, and I support the show Of what was once a monarch. Is my life To be henceforth a lonesome spectacle Of fallen power, the mockery of kings, The wonder of the curious multitude, Whose metaphysics easily explores The pride of levell'd grandeur? Do I stand Upon the soil which my ungovern'd will Once ruled, to only watch its government By other sceptres than my own? Thus left Save by the faithful few whose looks promote My hopes, will I once more ascend my throne. No living creature is within my view, No courtier watches for the withered smile Of this changed figure; none beseeches now For favour, place, or wealth. No warrior Comes with the news of distant victories, To seek reward. Not even the poor appear To show their meek complaint against the strong. To me my children are not! Desolate Indeed is he who once has swayed the earth, Who once has been a parent, thus to be! He enters the temple. PSAMMENITOS, PIROMIS. PSAMMENITOS. Hast thou obeyed thy monarch's last command, And rallied round his throne the faithful band Which still is free? PIROMIS. Siuphis poisoned dies. PSAMMENITOS. Dies! what funereal honours are at hand To please his manes! Are thy adherents firm? PIROMIS. They are; this night will bring back liberty, Or close on us for ever! PSAMMENITOS. It may bring That outward liberty with which mankind Concerns its waste desires! Can it restore The dignity of an unvanquish'd throne; The home affections; the undaunted looks With which I smiled on man? We meet again At midnight, here or in the realms below. Psammenitos departs. PIROMIS. Who comes? It is th' infuriated king. I'll meet him; he shall never enter here. PIROMIS, CAMBYSES, SOLDIERS. PIROMIS. Why comest thou hither in this threatening guise? Though power be in thy grasp, and empire bind Thy brow with outward monarchy, above Is Fate, sole ruler, never yet unthron'd. Thou may'st disperse us from the Lybian hills, To never more those pyramids adore, Which will not own thy greatness, or give up Their giant dead, between whose forms and heaven The unrecording vacancy hath fled, Whose deeds the monumental silence tells. Thou may'st pollute this consecrated land, Its temples, glowing in the light of prayer; But all thy malice never can efface The footsteps of the greater left behind. CAMBYSES. Amid the ruins of this hated fane Shalt thou be crushed! Thy treachery had reach'd My all-suspecting mind ere thou did'st speak Thy purposes to the conspiring king. Him did I honour, and to royalty Restore; nor shall he therefore more appear Humbled as thou; but instantly shall die. Thou by the hungry populace whose voice Demands thy blood, shalt now be massacred; Their jaws shall tear thee piecemeal, and devour Thy flesh, as savage beasts devour their prey. PIROMIS. Is such thy will? How ludicrous is power! Am I in thy weak hands? for not a chord Of awe within me shakes at thy decree. All torture which hath not the power to quench The spirit of a mortal, may be borne: When insupportable 'tis felt not more. A Crowd approaches. VOICES OF THE PEOPLE. Death to the priest! by his detested arts Was Horos kept in prison. PIROMIS. Do I hear? The congregated passion, like a sea By nature left to its unguided course Is turbulent; the quantity of man Against the god-like quality engaged. The crude humanity, whence nature shapes The rarer masterpiece, rebellious moves Against the work which heaven was pleased to form Of its material. CAMBYSES. Thou daring man! Henceforth thy race shall grovel in the dust. PIROMIS. Then is the path on which thy anger treads, Pav'd with the glory of past centuries. Resign the prospect, lest against thy head The curse of the Piromides prevail. CAMBYSES. What, man? PIROMIS. Thou shalt be told. There is a place More dear to beings human and divine Than all the wrath of thy majestic soul. That place is Isis! Should'st thou touch the walls With hand profane, recall this solemn oath: Thy dreadful phrenzy never to subside 'Till it hath scatter'd every lucid thought, Shall, in the semblance of thy reason, gain Supremacy within thee. It thy guide, Thou shalt destroy the partner of thy rest, Drain of vitality thy sister's shape, All thy attendants slaughter, and afar Behold thy brother fix'd on Persia's throne. VOICES OF THE PEOPLE. On to the temple; he beneath its stones, This night shall sleep for ever. PIROMIS. 'Tis the voice Of the brute number, of the monstrous host. O, if my time of reckoning be nigh, May my long life from them be separate For ever; may two kingdoms us divide. To dwell with them for ever, dreadful scene, Would brutalize this immortality. CAMBYSES. Strange man! thy portion was to succour them. PIROMIS. Thou earth-born! look upon this haughty brow! I was not made for menial offices, Nor, tho' besought by helpless misery, To pander to the wants of the Most-Low. He mounts the steps of the temple. CAMBYSES. Ye soldiers, ministers of my revenge, Prostrate the temple's columns that the wreck Of all its super-structure downward roll To crush him. Scatter with unsparing hand The altars and the statues of the gods, Lay bare the inner walls of sepulchres, And drag to light the dwellers of the tombs. CAMBYSES, NITETIS. NITETIS. I bring thee word Psammenitos is dead. CAMBYSES. He had a lofty nature; let him pass The calm and endless period in a tomb Worthy to hold his manes. Choose one thyself In honour to a fallen enemy! NITETIS. Here is our hatred centred, all besides Shall feel the balm of pity. It shall be The distant tomb whose Cyclopean walls Embrace a city in their massive pile. It is the resting place of twelve great kings Co-reigning! At the distant angles stand Four pyramids with figures closely carv'd As is the labyrinth which stands between. 'Tis on the margin of the tranquil lake From whose unvision'd depths emerge the trunks Of hand-erected columns, that support On high colossal monarchs on their thrones. Thus I forgive a royal enemy That is no more. On to the hated fane, Where thou shalt see the priest shed woman's tears. CAMBYSES. This hour he dies. NITETIS. Yet not till he hath seen His only son a corpse beneath his feet. Lo! in funereal pomp my hate is wrapt, And, in procession, to the temple comes. The laughing torch shows gloominess its path. This way, the body carry to the fane. Yes! my revenge shall pierce the bosom'd hope, Shall bow the priestly head to earth in tears. Here lies his son, the casket of his pride. Had not this youth been born to die by me That I might blight his father, with this hand I would have slaughter'd Horos to fulfil The oracle's prediction! Let me gain Piromis' ear and speak Latona's words. Priest listen to the oracle's decree:â âThe hour that Horos prematurely dies, Thy temple, Isis, in wide ruin lies!â Now ponder well that victim, by the mouth Of the Piromides condemn'd to die. Bring the torch near, bend downward and regard A face thou never lov'dst; unbind the eyes,â O! unrelenting deities, 'tis He! She sinks to the earth. PIROMIS. Bring ye the corpse of Horos to his tomb, Demanding sacred honours; hath the Nile Engulph'd him? Then with his was link'd my doom! Let me retire within the sacred walls, There will I rest in death; and, if it may, My spirit long shall haunt this solemn site, Tho' not a wreck remain. A word with thee, O thou Eternal! Now, Piromis claims That practice of high reason which in life Was only manifest in infant dreams. O generous giver of immortal souls! Soon shall I bear, in person, to thy throne The solemn thanks which now my heart repeats For this high being, and the benefits Which a great life of intellect on earth Entail'd: of that bright period my praise For the last time I offer, as I stand Upon the confines of a hoped-for land. VOICES OF THE PEOPLE. He falls destroy'd beneath a column's weight. NITETIS, starting up. Ah! he is crush'd! and that, before his son Hath fix'd death's eyes upon him! Cruel fate, Lost in the very moment of revenge! Where is the hated corpse of Inaros? NITETIS, CAMBYSES, SIUPHIS. SIUPHIS. Thou venom'd work of nature's spiteful mood, Thou foul example to the fiends, suppos'd To occupy the dim abodes of night With souls gone from us, unillum'd by hope! My hand has pour'd thy vengeance back again, To poison thee, as thou hast poison'd me! I am too weak to draw thy wicked blood, And make for thee a death-bed in the mire, But when thou diest, within the narrow pass Of some infernal passage I will fix My ghost, that it may strangle thee, and strike Its fangs, earn'd by iniquity, across Whate'er of thee escapes the gripe of death. Now the prophetic world above me dawns. Upon the map of time I trace the lines Of thy still deeper shame; of thy last hope Denied; thy station set in solitude! Thou still hast hope! NITETIS. Is there no weapon near? SIUPHIS. It comes too late; thy victory is gain'd. And to the shades by vengeance wing'd I pass. He dies. Enter LADICE, pointing to CAMBYSES. LADICE. Thou still hast hope; it lies in thy revenge! Now look on thy avenger! NITETIS. Spectral form! Why doth Cambyses trembling watch the blaze Of yonder temple! pallid is his brow; His features, unserene, their places change And picture horror. Who approaches now? 'Tis he! how basely then am I betray'd! LADICE points to INAROS, who enters. Thou still hast hope! where hath thy vengeance fled? NITETIS. How living hath he 'scap'd his prison-house? LADICE. Fate was the liberator! Fate decreed To save the proud religion of thy land. She dies. NITETIS. Thou art Piromis now! thy father's soul Dilates thee, thou inheritest his lookâ That quiet, silent, and avenging smile! Still does Piromis live, he triumphs here! Crush'd is his mortal part; but here his will And his heart-chilling intellect he sends To crush me, to deride my lost design, And mock me in my fullest misery. Canst thou endure to think of this, O king? O plunge thy weapon in his growing form, Which rises o'er me like the father's shade! Wake from thy reverie, and, ere too late, Be my avenger! CAMBYSES. Hence! thou hateful fiend! What noise is that I hear? Is it the stones Of Isis' solemn temple rushing down, A cataract of premature decay? The fire of heaven descends the fractur'd dome, And thro' the ruin'd line of columns glares, And now is dark like me. The crash again! The flames now fling their murderous spires along The solemn aspect of the crumbling walls. I see distinctly walking 'midst their rage, In calm repose of interchanging thought, The metamorphos'd figures of the priest And his pale king; they pause, and point at me. The earth moves round me; all my senses cling In vain unto their axis; and my thoughts, Whirl'd with a force centrifugal, escape Their link'd connection. This the priest foretold! The darkness of my spirit dims the space Which reason travers'd; and, behind my sight, The orb of intellect inglorious sets. The dreadful workings of his prophecy! THE END.</field>
