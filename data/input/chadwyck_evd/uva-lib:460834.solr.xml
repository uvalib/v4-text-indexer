      <field name="fulltext">Dedication, by Vittorio Alfieri, to AGIS TO THE MOST SACRED MAJESTY OF CHARLES THE FIRST, King of Great Britain, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÆ. Agis. Leonidas. Agesistrata. Agiziade. Anpharus. Ephori. Senators. People. Soldiers of Leonidas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,—The Forum, afterwards the Prison, of Sparta.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Leonidas, Anpharus. An. Behold, Leonidas, thou once more sittest Upon thy royal throne. Entirely, Sparta, Or of her citizens the better part, Those who are really and maturely wise, The lovers of the public weal, have turn'd Their eyes to thee, expecting, by thy means, To gain a respite from their long distress. Le. Yet thence I do not deem, while Agis lives, That I am king of Sparta. He not only Lives, but reigns also in the hearts of many. This temple is to him a place of refuge, Whose neighbouring portals every day are fill'd With a tumultuary audacious throng, Who yet desire him for their king, and cry For him once more my partner on the throne. An. And fearest thou to be o'ercome by him? I swear, and all the other ephori Swear likewise, Agis never shall be king. But art is rather needful now than force ... Le. Lately had he such influence acquired, That he had dared, with his contrivances, And with his new and ill-imagined laws, To overturn all Spartan institutes By open force, and from the throne to drive Me into exile: ought I, in that throne, Reseated by my faithful Spartans, now To avenge myself on him by hidden schemes? An. Thou art compell'd to stoop to stratagems: He is thy son-in-law. The day that thou In cruel banishment, alone, abandon'd, Robb'd of thy royal crown, from Sparta wentest, He shew'd thee kindness. To the fierce assassin, That in pursuit of thee, to spill thy blood, Agesilaus sent, with open force Agis opposed himself, and led thee safe (Thou must remember) to Tegæa's confines: In this one act alone he did not seem The son of Agesistrata, in this Openly adverse to her guilty brother. Thou only now canst prosecute thy vengeance By feign'd concernment for the public good. Le. An infamous gift he made me of my life The day that he expell'd me from the throne; And as the injury most exquisite, Should I impute it to him. He deem'd me A foe no longer to be fear'd! To-day Will I in this entirely undeceive him. That he's my son-in-law, doubles in me My hatred towards him. Son-in-law to me? Ah! what was my mistake t'have given to him A lady so dissimilar in marriage? No reparation but his death remains. Beloved Agiziade, mine only daughter, Thou my companion, my solace thou Wert to me in my dreary exile. She Abandon'd her beloved spouse, since he Was hostile to her father; she esteem'd The ties of nature more imperative Than those of love: and she would rather drag A wretched wandering life with me, than share The throne with my unworthy adversary. An. Yet in proportion as thy rage is just, Suppress its workings, if thou would'st indulge it. Not less than thee I hate the haughty Agis; And his parade of antiquated virtues, Feign'd to reflect on us. It is a folly No less ambitious than malevolent, To seek to rivet Sparta with those chains That erst Lycurgus framed: yet his design Has no less scope than this; hence had his rule Reduced our city to extremity: And yet distracted, languishing she lies, In tumults, and perplexities involved. But all things change with time. Those factious traitors, The ephori, Agesilaus' slaves, And more to him devoted than to Agis, Are all with him now banish'd or destroy'd, And Sparta now in us alone is centred. But the flagitious, discontented people, Always desirous of new men and measures, Yet, as a means to their pernicious views, Their suffrage give to Agis. Ill can we Restrain them by mere force; it is not safe In a new government to use coercion. The people may, with less of peril, be Deluded than compell'd. Leave thou to me This enterprise, in which, not less than thine, My heart an interest takes. But here, behold Comes Agesistrata. This lady makes Fresh progress in th'affections of the Spartans From day to day: she also should be fear'd. SCENE THE SECOND. Agesistrata, Leonidas, Anpharus. Ages. Who interrupts my progress? While I go To the asylum of the Spartan monarch, Around these confines do I not behold Another, and new king of Sparta stalk? Le. And had I an asylum in the world On that disastrous day, when Sparta's king From Sparta I was driven? For a long time I lived in exile from the throne; and lived, Which is far worse, apparently a culprit. Grief would have slain me, if my innocence, Together with my usurp'd majesty, Had not been fully to myself restored By wiser councils of that very Sparta. Cleombrotus, my execrable rival, Banish'd from Sparta, he, to whom thy son, Master of all things then, my sceptre gave, Himself made my defence. To publish his, Why delays Agis? He was on the throne My colleague; yet he is my daughter's consort; And may, if so it please him, be my foe.— But say, what other cause except his guilt Detains him now imprison'd in the temple? Ages. Leonidas, to Sparta and to me Thou art but too well known: what are thy faults, And what are those of Agis, is express'd In a few words. Agis wish'd Sparta free; Equal her citizens, courageous, strong, And terrible: true Spartans: and he wish'd, Not to be paramount to any man, Except in magnanimity and virtue. Rich, mercenary, sunk in indolence, Effeminate, by party spirit torn, Such as she is in short, Leonidas Desired her still to be. To guilt ascribed Are Agis' purposes, because the bad In Sparta o'er the good preponderate; Those of Leonidas ascribed to virtue, Because they are adapted to the times. To-day, at least, remember if thou canst, That my son shew'd himself the open foe Of thy power only, never of thy person; Reflect that now thou would'st not live, if he, More citizen than king, had not preserved, And perhaps to his own detriment, thy life. Le. 'Tis true, that Agis, perhaps in spite of thee, On that same day on which thy cruel brother Sent vile assassins to destroy my life, By other satellites, to him attach'd, Preserved me living, and exempt from wounds: But can a banish'd king, of throne bereft, Bereft of honour and of innocence, By a fierce rival, his ill-granted life Ascribe to generous impulses of pity? Ages. The gift was no less noble than imprudent: Agis himself so deem'd it; but innate Is magnanimity in that great heart. Th'illustrious Agis would not, with thy blood, Contaminate the enterprise, at once Unparallel'd and generous, of a king, Resolved spontaneously to reinstate His people in illimitable freedom. I ne'er dissuaded him from pardoning thee; And perhaps should have attempted it in vain: Mother of Agis, could I e'er betray A heart less high than that of such a son? 'Tis true, I call Agesilaus brother; But now of such a name he is unworthy. With florid eloquence, and specious virtues, Covering his irreclaimable corruption, Agis and Sparta, and with these myself, He hath deceived ... Le. Never Leonidas. Ages. He was thy counterpart, and thence well known. To take for ever from the creditors And debtors, from the rich and mendicants, Their Anti-Spartan names, Agesilaus, More than all other men, persuaded Agis. Seeing himself by our example forced To sacrifice his riches, and subdued By brutal avarice, disgracing thus Th'ephori's sacred function, he forbade The high participation. Hence the people, Confused, and more oppress'd, in doubt and fear Betwixt their not extinguish'd servitude, And their confounded, scarce reviving freedom, Recall'd thee to the throne: and chose in thee A worthy instrument to prop once more Their soft, incurably corrupted customs. That very people, to thy hands gave bound Cleombrotus, erewhile elected king: That very people to the custody Of an asylum only relegates Agis, their monarch once so idolized. An. Far more is he protected by the laws, Than by this his asylum. Though he be Th'annuller and subverter of those laws, Yet does he owe to them and us his safety. To us, true ephori, before all Sparta, Will he be challenged to defend himself: Provided he can prove his innocence, He need not fear the monarch or his people. Le. If in his heart he is not self-accused, Whence this asylum? Why not summon me To an impartial judgment at the just And popular tribunal? Ages. Because thou Dost render it (of virtue destitute) Thy instrument with bribery and arms. Because thou dost return full of revenge, Which that tribunal too well knows: in short, Because thy new, not Spartan ephori, Other than legal terrors fulminate. My Agis knows not fear; but he would snatch Himself from infamy; which evermore He who usurps authority, on others Can, for a transient space at least, bestow. Le. What will thy Agis do then? He cannot Now longer keep himself conceal'd, if he Fear real infamy. An. Much less can Sparta, In her existing strange vicissitudes, Endure the loss of one of her two kings. Agis still bears the name, yet he performs not The necessary functions of a king: Meanwhile within its ramparts, and without Sparta is insecure; its institutes Are all despised; and there is need ... Ages. Of Agis; And with him need of every thing that's good. The enemies of Sparta know this truth As well as we, in whose breasts Agis only Revived a terror of our arms. Yes, Agis, The beardless Agis, made the Ætolians tremble, On whom the great Aratus, hoary leader, Made no impression with his fierce Achaians. I do conjure thee now, Leonidas, To undertake no scheme for his destruction. For notwithstanding fate, often unjust, Should crown thy efforts now in the attempt, From thence would'st thou in course of time entail Heavy disgrace and blame upon thyself, And on thy country lasting detriment. A know not whether country be to thee A sacred name; but among us it is A name so strong and paramount to all, That if a fleeting doubt rose in my heart Whether the thoughts, much more the deeds of Agis, Were all directed to the good of Sparta, I, though his mother, I would first implore Against my son, in all its plenitude, The inexorable rigour of the laws. Act thou then now according to thy judgment, Nor Agis, nor who brought him into life, Save for their country and their countrymen Can ever tremble: thou, although in arms, And in a prosperous state, within thy heart Self-conscious, tremble for thyself alone. Le. Lady, thou art a mother, and of one Thou art a mother who possess'd the sceptre, Hence I excuse thee. Fear in you dwells not; So say'st thou. May its absence be auspicious; But the ephori and Sparta, and myself Give to you only one whole day to prove This innocence of yours, for ever vaunted, And never proved. Let him at last come forth, And exculpate himself; and even me, If so he will, let him accuse: his choice, Except in reference to this asylum, Is free in all things else. But say to him, If he persist to sequestrate himself, That Sparta by to-morrow's dawn no more Deems him her king, and I no more a colleague. SCENE THE THIRD. Agesistrata, Anpharus. An. He speaks embitter'd by his recent exile: But Sparta doth not share in his resentments. Thou shouldest, thou, to whom alike are dear Agis and Sparta, strive to adapt thy son To times like these, and inculcate compliance ... Ages. To compromise his honour, not myself, Nor you, nor Sparta, ever could induce him. That the king's rage is not the rage of Sparta, The throng immense of Spartans in fresh troops, Round his asylum every day assembled, Sufficiently convince me, who call him, With loud, audacious, and intrepid cries, Preserver, sovereign-citizen, and father; Second deliverer, a new Lycurgus. His virtue must indeed be eminent, Since Sparta thus dare praise him at her peril; Since admiration of that excellence Greater effects in Sparta can produce Than all the terror of your arm'd adherents. An. The people gather into crowds, and shout, Yet nothing they attempt: nor will their vile And turbulent deportment aught effect, Except increasingly to exasperate The good against thy son. Thou canst do much, Mother of Agis, on the Spartan people; On Agis canst do more: the first induce, (I pray thee hear) to cease from turbulence; The second, for a little time at least, To adapt himself to time and circumstance. If thy son's good, and if the good of all Thou dost desire, 'tis ill, thou know'st, ensured By civil violence and rabid strife.— If thou refusest, in a cause like this, Warmly to exert thyself, not wrongfully, Leonidas, and Sparta, and myself, Will execrate you as domestic foes; Then, then 'will irrefragably appear That all your ample wealth, a tribute large, Was with malignant purposes relinquish'd To purchase in reversion for yourselves Supremacy, and not equality. The fame of lofty efforts, good or bad, On the event depends. Let not your deeds, Magnanimous and generous (if they are,) Receive a taint from other men's suspicions, Which tax you now with probable repentance For such a mighty gift; and further tax you With a design large harvest thence to reap. I, as a magistrate and citizen, Not as a foe, lay every thing before thee: On you alone it afterwards depends To take what measures seem the most expedient. SCENE THE FOURTH. Agesistrata. Ages. Fain would these men gain time; but time shall not Be granted to them. Ah, the suavity Of Anpharus, so subtly feign'd; the rage Of fierce Leonidas, with pain repress'd, Too manifestly indicate to me The destiny of Agis and of Sparta. Let nothing now be left untried to save them; And if our country's angry gods with blood Alone can be appeased, myself and Agis Will for that country die; we're born to serve her. May Sparta from our ashes rise once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Agis. Agis. Ye pitying gods, who have till now been pleased To rescue from Leonidas's rage My well-known innocence, no more can I Remain within your temple. I from you Sought an asylum, that my infirm country Might not be forced t'endure more violence, More slaughter, and more broils: now there are those Who dare ascribe this step to my misdeeds, And to the terror of just punishment. Behold, at once the asylum I relinquish.— Oh Sparta, Sparta! ... To thy true deliverers Must thou be ever fatal? Ah, to me Were but the fate allow'd that once befell Thy first illustrious father! Not content With everlasting exile, on himself Inflicted by Lycurgus, I would chuse Further, ignoble death, if by that death I might at least behold with thee revive The pristine vigour of thy sacred laws! ... But who so quickly comes to this asylum? ... Whom do I see? Oh heavens! Agiziade! ... The daughter of Leonidas! ... Alas! ... That consort, who, although so well beloved, Yet for her father's sake abandon'd me! SCENE THE SECOND. Agis, Agiziade. Agi. What do I see? My Agis, hast thou ventured To leave the asylum? Speedily I came To find thee there ... Agis. Whate'er thou wert towards me, My still beloved consort, why dost thou Thus bend thy steps towards a wretched husband? Agi. Scarce can I speak, oh Agis. ... I return To thee, with thy embitter'd, alter'd fate. Thy mournful state, and that alone, had power To tear me from my father. On the day That I was forced, oh consort, to abandon My children, and thyself, that I might not Suffer my father, in his wretched exile, To go from us a lonely fugitive, I felt my heart as if asunder torn: Nor would'st thou ever have beheld me more, I now confess to thee, in Sparta's soil, If to the cruel shafts of adverse fortune He had remain'd obnoxious. Once more he Is raised on high; thou, in thy turn, depress'd. Who, who could now dissever me from thee? With all my heart do I to thee return: And I conjure thee, by my unfeign'd love; (For thine, I know not if I yet possess it;) By those loved children once to thee so dear; And further I conjure thee by thy country, To which thou art so loftily devoted, To grant at least a respite for the present To thy new institutes. May love of peace, The first of benefits, to this induce thee: Be pleased to reassume, as heretofore, In strict conjunction with Leonidas, Supreme controulment of the Spartan state. Agis. Lady, who could that fondness ever blame Thou bear'st thy father? Thou canst never know him; This is not thy prerogative: most good, Most fond, most pious, most accomplish'd, thou, In these corrupted times, a rare example Of pristine conjugal and filial love; Feel'st no solicitude except to be The generous partner of his destiny Whom adverse fortunes persecutes the most. If thou wert ever dear to me, to see thee To-day return to me when all men fly, Makes thee to me more dear. From thy great heart Less I expected not: I only fear'd That with his happiness intoxicate, Leonidas perchance might interdict Thy quitting him for me. Agi. Just were thy fears. Since Sparta as a conqueror received him Three days have past; three days have also past That I have combated with him for thee. Nor, since I could not his consent obtain, Was I less firm, whate'er the risk might be, To join thee here. Himself, at length compliant, A little while ago to thee would send me A messenger of peace: he, by my lips, Now proffers it to thee without reserve; He begs thee and conjures thee, that thou wilt, (Abandoning thy retreat,) in concert with him, Adopt all means whence Sparta may obtain Henceforth entire indissoluble peace. Agis. Doth he send thee to me? This change, so sudden, Permits the indulgence of no joyful hope. What do I say? If in himself he hope not, Can Agis hope? What more remains for me To fear, when my poor country every day Is more enslaved?—more, every day, remote From her primæval eminence, her great, Illustrious, and immortalizing virtues? I had already of my own accord Abandon'd my retreat: far other motives Had now induced me to anticipate The crafty wishes of Leonidas ... Ah! this will be a memorable day To Sparta and to me; fatal perchance To thee, if thou dost love me ... I cannot, Oh my beloved consort, doubt of this ... But, if thou hearkenest to my upright words, Do not thou, worthy of a better father, I do beseech thee, irritate in vain His captious soul. Live for thy children's sake; Against the rage of fierce Leonidas Be thou to them a shield: those lofty thoughts Which I have ever shared with thee, and which Thou feltest so profoundly, fortified By other lofty ones in thee innate, Which are the source sublime of filial love, Do thou in them transfuse, that they may live The glory of their father and their country. A thirst for vengeance do I not expire, But Spartan virtues panting to restore: Provided that they one day may arise, Although in distant times, from sons of mine, With this my spirit will be satisfied ... Agi. My heart thou rendest ... Why thus speak of death? Agis. Thou art a Spartan, and the wife of Agis; Refrain from tears. My blood may serve my country; My tears cannot serve thee. Ah, dry thine eyes; Compel me not to weep ... Agi. I know full well The bitter agonies of thy sublime, Devoted heart; thy upright, generous schemes Within my breast profoundly are engraved; And if in their complete accomplishment The entire and lofty ruin of my father Were not involved, e'en at the risk of life, Would'st thou find me first ready to promote them ... How oft have I lamented o'er that father, So different to thee! How oft have I Wept that I was his daughter! Yet, alas! I was indeed, and am ... and 'twixt you two I live distracted, and I ought to be The means of amity betwixt you both, Or ought to die. Agis. If thou in other times, From other blood hadst been in Sparta born, Daughter of Sparta, mother of true Spartans Thou would'st have been. Yet thy not Spartan father I would not as a crime to thee impute. Prompted by thy most generous, lofty heart, But not well disciplined, I heard thy lips Pronounce thy father's and thy consort's names, But not thy country's. Yet why should I wonder, If thou art more a daughter and a wife Than citizen? Whate'er thou art, I love thee; Nor any force, save that of my example, To thy not Spartan feelings would I use. Hence I conjure thee by our love, yea, more, If it be needful, I command, that thou Should'st manifest to-day that thou art yet E'en more a mother than a wife or daughter.— But whence this horrible tumult that approaches? What crowd is this? what cries? oh heaven! my mother! And a great multitude of people arm'd Pursues her steps! SCENE THE THIRD. Agis, Agesistrata, Agiziade, People. Ages. My son, and what, hast thou Left thy retreat? In whom dost thou confide? In the base daughter of Leonidas? Behold, I bring thee a more certain succour; These will at any moment be prepared ... Agis. Oh mother, thou should'st better know thy son: I in myself, or else in no one, trust. She whom thou call'st Leonidas's daughter, Is both my wife and friend, and one with me.— Spartans, if ye indeed are such, whom now I, at the risk of my renown, behold Tumultuously menacing in arms; Spartans, now Agis speaks to you: no arms I, in my favour, ever will endure Against my country. I seek no protection; Nor fear I any man. I well suffice To authenticate my perfect innocence: To make that innocence completely triumph O'er other's malice, not with arms indeed, But with more firm resolves, ye might yourselves A just support one day have given to me: But now, too late and vain, and (which is worse) Illicit, would your interference be. Ages. And would'st thou then expose thyself unarm'd To the malign rage of Leonidas? To the bribed ephori's perfidious snares? Ah! I endure it not, nor these true sons Of Sparta will endure it, who are all Now ready for their king to yield their lives. People. Yes, we are all ready to die for Agis. Agis. Agis and Sparta heretofore were one; Now are they thoroughly by fate disjoin'd; Now that, perchance, 'tis indispensable That Agis perish to make Sparta safe. Blood should be never spill'd; much less when blood Cannot regenerate virtue. Ye cannot Now die for me, without the sacrifice Of many others: and your own lives here, And those of others equally, are all Not yours, but the possession of your country. There are, I know, in multitudes there are, Misguided citizens: but to restore them To the straight path of duty I prepare A reconciliatory sacrifice. With this can I compel them to amendment; With this make you with fervour more intense The worshippers of self-renouncing virtue. Agi. Oh wretched me! Thou mak'st me tremble. Speak. What dost thou now intend? Ages. Lady, for whom Are these thy fears, thy husband or thy father? Agis. Mother, thou know'st not how it wounds my heart To hear thee thus irreverently taunt My faithful wife. She has this instant made Herself, with her true filial piety, More dear to me than ever yet she was.— Mother, and wife, and citizens, attend.— I have resolved within my inmost heart To make malignancy itself confess, The most invidious, and the most depraved, That I'm a real lover of my country. A king, a father, and a citizen, And nothing else have I to Sparta been; At least if I am not deceived: in others Perhaps I myself, with violence, inspired At first some misconception of myself. This choice of an asylum thence was not To wisdom in me, but a guilty conscience, And terrors of just punishment, ascribed. Thence Agis of a vulgar king endured The insufferable stigma. But to-day, Such as it is, my heart shall be reveal'd. Oh welcome, yes, thrice welcome, is the danger Which I am forced to encounter, to make clear The good which I attempted to effect, And of those men whose interest is in evil The circumventive and invidious malice! I well knew how to prove myself a king, And dared to do it, for the public good; And for my private good I also dare Become once more a private citizen. Not that I hope at present to convince The countless disaffected; they in heart Already are too much so; but I ought Now in the presence of collected Sparta, To cover them with shame and infamy. They would, and still I hope they will, accuse me: I rather with my actions, than with words, Shall undertake to exculpate myself. First would I unreservedly to Sparta Promulgate my intentions, then submit ... People. Agis submit! No, never! All of us Will make those traitors listen to thy words ... Agis. Not you, oh no! Truth, from my lips alone, Shall make me by unwilling ears be heard. And if my honour in your sight is dear; If I have any thing from you deserved; If there is aught in me; or if, at least, Ye, from the recollection of my deeds, For something hope, I supplicate, exhort, Nay, I command you, to lay down your arms, And to the ephori, whate'er they be, To render, with myself, submission due. The king of Persia, when he finds that foes Are risen against himself within his realm, Accosts them with compulsatory weapons; But Sparta's monarch doth esteem himself E'en to his enemies accountable: At first he strives to baffle calumny With arguments; but if in vain, he meets it With the immoveable calmness of a king.— I grieve that, and eternally shall grieve, The same Leonidas, who thus assails me, Unheard and exiled, from your city went. Perchance his cause he could not have defended; Perchance he would not have attempted it; But for this purpose I should have allow'd him Ample convenience. My guilty colleague, Agesilaus, was resolved on force; My opposition ineffectual proved. Few are aware of this: hence he and I In the same imputation are involved. I from thenceforth discover'd, though too late, That he was only a dissembling Spartan: But time press'd on me, and the lofty wish To effect the good, to which the banishment Of fierce Leonidas (its chiefest hindrance) Seem'd to prepare the way. His exile, hence, Just, but inflicted in an unjust manner, I tolerated for the good of Sparta. People. And who knows not that thou didst save his life? Agi. Yes, by his means alone my father yet Enjoys the breath of life. Myself beheld The cruel danger which surrounded him; The assassins of Agesilaus now Had almost in their snares entangled him, When opportunely Agis' partizans Dispersed them, and deliver'd us unhurt. Ages. Leonidas to-day would hence repay him, By wresting from him not his life alone, But his fame also. Agis. To effect this purpose The tyrant has no power: on me alone, And on my deeds, my fame depends. Ages. The firm And persevering project to oppress thee, The jealousy of others, from thy deeds Solely arise. But Anpharus comes hither, The friend and colleague worthy of the tyrant. Agis. Let him be heard. Agi. Oh heavens! for thee I tremble ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Agis, Agesistrata, Agiziade, Anpharus, People. An. Far from thy refuge, Agis, in the midst Of such a throng, I did not think to find thee. But yet more grateful witnesses than these I could not wish to meet. I hither come The will of Sparta to unfold to thee. Agis. It is ... An. Pacific. Agis. How? An. It breathes true peace, If peace be not too adverse to thy views; Or if at once security and greatness Thou dost not seek in turbulence and discord. Agis. I ought not now to clear myself to thee: Perhaps before them to whom I owe the homage, Of this I shall acquit myself. Meanwhile, What is this peace Leonidas proposes? An. Am I the monarch's messenger? I am One of the ephori; in Sparta's name Do I address thee. If thou now consent To yield submission to the citizens, (The true and wise ones,) and restore once more Peace to the city, each new law of thine Thyself condemning, Sparta, by my lips, To-day restores to thee thy royal seat, Which thou hast abdicated by thy flight. Ages. Agis ... Agis. I am thy son, oh mother; now On me rely.—Thou, that in Sparta's name, So that I make myself unworthy of it, Offerest to me the throne, I pray thee take This answer to Leonidas, that I Would speak with him, ere to collected Sparta I solemnly and finally appeal. Agi. I do beseech thee to my father go, Oh Anpharus, and urge him to compliance. Make him remember that he would not now Be blest with life, had it not been for Agis; That he to Agis as a consort gave His much-loved only daughter ... Agis. Nothing else Make him remember, than that we are both The citizens of Sparta; and that now The interest of all obliges him To grant me audience. An. It is most uncertain Whether he can or will confer with thee, Till he has learn'd if his proposed conditions Are by thyself rejected or embraced. Agis. He can, on no account, nor will he do it, Refuse to hear me. I, from henceforth, quit For ever my asylum: round my person No train do I permit.—Spartans, to you Do I authoritatively exclaim, Here, undefended, innocent, alone, Will I remain.—Anpharus, The people here retire, and disperse. witness thou; The time, the place, the circumstance, all now Will be most opportune. Ere it be long, I to this forum will return; and here May the king not disdain to come to me. I shall be here alone; but let him have His satellites beside him; we shall be By all the citizens of Sparta seen, But shall not be by any of them heard. An. Since thou wilt have it so, I quickly fly To bear the tidings to Leonidas. SCENE THE FIFTH. Agis, Agesistrata, Agiziade. Agis. Well did I know with what a bait t'entice him.— Now, ladies, to my dwelling and my children Let me return with you. I shall enjoy A few brief, final moments, in your presence, Of private consolation, till I join This fatal conference. Agi. Oh heaven! ... Ages. Oh son! What canst thou hope from this perfidious king? Agis. He grasps the fate of Sparta; and canst thou, Oh mother, ask what Agis hopes from him?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Agis. Agis. Leonidas yet comes not: he perchance Disdains the challenge? He dare not: here shame, If nothing else, should bring him now. Erewhile The people heard the generous invitation, That I, by Anpharus, dispatch'd to him: Many considerations yet restrain him, Many and powerful; many apprehensions, Though he be victor, lurk within his heart. Ah, could I, could I, by his fears promote The interest of Sparta! ... But at length He comes; oh! does he thus appropriate A royal retinue? It fits him well. SCENE THE SECOND. Agis, Leonidas, Soldiers. Agis. Oh king, or ere another task begins, Thou com'st to hear me? ... Le. Yes, I come to hear thee ... Agis. Then, I demand to speak to thee alone ... Le. Withdraw. The soldiers retire.—I am alone: I listen to thee. Agis. I speak not to thee as thy daughter's husband: Though, beyond all expression, I adore A wife who is the paragon of daughters. Le. She was, 'tis true, a powerful tie betwixt us, Ere thou from Sparta drov'st me into exile. Agis. I know it: nor should I now mention it, Since I refrain'd from speaking of it then. Not that I then forgot it, this thou knowest; But thoughts of Sparta then my speech inspired, Whose bidding silenced, and still silences, In me all other impulses.—Thou, king Of Sparta, art my foe: but if thou art Not so of Sparta, I to-day demand, And from the gods, protectors of my country, Hope to obtain, an eloquence so strong, So true, and lofty, that thou may'st by me The prompt and certain method now be taught, Whence to obtain perchance beyond thy wishes ... Le. Beyond my wishes? Know'st thou what I wish? Agis. Vengeance on me, before all other things Thou wishest, and shalt have it; I to thee Will give it thoroughly. Thy second wish Is lasting power, and I will point to thee Its certain source. Nor satisfied with this; A method, lofty and infallible, I offer to thee, whence thou may'st acquire Another blessing, to which perhaps thy thoughts Have ne'er aspired: and it is such, that thou (Provided it be easy to obtain) Canst not despise it. Permanent, immense, This will I gain thee yet ... Le. And it is? ... Agis. Fame.— Le. Thou art rather fitted to prevent, than give it.— With me the throne thou filledst; never then Didst thou concur with me for Sparta's good, Or for our common glory: thou alone Thought'st of thy private interest, and to make Thyself a name upon the wreck of mine: Hence Sparta to extremity, and me To exile, thou didst goad. I do not mean To take revenge for this; I ought, indeed, To exact it now for lacerated Sparta; But a true love of peace checks me in this: Peace, which thy colleagues in iniquity, Although in vain, are ready to disturb. The love of peace, in short, induces me To offer to thee now, in Sparta's name, Pardon entire ... Agis. Entire? It is too much.— Come, no one hears us here; what boots deceit? Thou thinkest that I do not read thy heart; Thou canst not make me think that heart is changed. I think, however, that to take from me The power and sceptre, would not now suffice To make thee fully on the throne secure. Thou knowest well that while I live thou canst not Install another colleague thy liege vassal: But neither dar'st thou at the same time slay me, Because thou'rt well aware that in the hearts Of many still I reign. Behold thy true, And most-conceal'd reflections: now hear mine.— Within th'asylum I inclosed myself Against my will; spontaneously I quit it; And force to force, if I were so inclined, I might oppose: art to oppose to art, I neither have the skill, nor will to do it. That to defend my cause, I will not spill A drop of Spartan blood, thou shouldest now Be well convinced. Thou seest me now alone: I in thy power am placed: behold me now A suppliant for my country. I am ready To yield to thee for her not life alone, But also fame. Le. Hast thou this fame of thine Unspotted, which thou dar'st to offer me? Agis. Unspotted, yes, throughout; and worthy Agis; And too illustrious for thy envious eyes. Me thou abhorrest; Sparta I adore: Now hear how thou at once may'st gratify Thy hatred and my love. I undertook, By equalizing all the citizens, In Sparta to revive true liberty, Greatness, and virtue. With the most depraved Thou never ceasedst to oppose thyself, Although in vain; and not that thou in this Didst never see the common benefit, Immense and unalloy'd; not that pure truth, With her divine resplendence, did not find, Alas! without inflaming it, a passage To thy resisting heart: but in that heart, The love of gold, and arbitrary power, Wither'd at once all patriotic thoughts, Baffled the cry of truth, the vital warmth, And permeating influence of virtue. The universal, genuine voice of Sparta Removed thee from thy throne, proclaiming thee Thy country's foe: nor didst thou even try T'impugn the insupportable reproach. In exile afterwards, proscribed, and wandering, Thou knowest well thou hadst been vilely slain; I hinder'd it: nor do I now say this To thee upbraidingly, but to afford No dubious evidence, that not thy ruin, But lofty Spartan actions were indeed Alone the object of my lofty schemes. Le. And of a fatal inadvertency Must thou reproach thyself in saving me. Agis. And thou wilt make for this, by slaying me, Ample atonement. Only do thou learn Of me the means for this.—To liberty, More that to tyranny, is Sparta inclined: Of this be thou assured, though for the present Thou hast imposed on her the kingly yoke. A transient indignation of the many Against the infamous Agesilaus, Hath now replaced thee on the throne, and driven Him from the ephori: there are who now Deem me a partner in his crimes, and not Entirely without cause, while I am silent. Do not thou goad me on to clear myself Of such reproach effectually; 'twould be Most easy to demonstrate, that the king Betray'd at once both Sparta and myself: If I make this to all men clear, then thou Canst not, without much injury to thyself, Use violence towards me. Le. Thou thinkest so? Agis. Thou knowest it. But do not fear. I wish'd To be the Spartan monarch of true Spartans; Thee I leave king of these. No force of thine Avails to make me guilty: I will, I, Make myself culpable before all Sparta; Will yield thee the entire ascendancy Over myself; will make thee really great Against thy will, provided thou aspire To greatness. Le. Thou in vain insultest me ... Agis. Do thou thyself, yes now, accomplish that For Sparta, and her glory's sake, which I Audaciously attempted. From the throne Do thou once more promulgate not my laws, But the free, sacred, lofty, manly ones Of great Lycurgus: banish poverty At once with wealth; she is the child of wealth: Resign thy riches; equalize the people; Become thyself a Spartan, and at once Spartans create: ... this purposed I to do; Do thou accomplish it, and snatch from me Th'eternal glory of the enterprise.— If thou wilt swear to me to accomplish this, Thou before Sparta as a criminal May'st drag me now; and say I made a plea Of public good to screen my private views; And say, that though my purposes were guilty, My laws were not so. Thou shalt add to this, That thou thyself, with a more upright mind, And greater singleness of heart, once more The glory of thy city wilt renew. Then in the presence of collected Sparta Shall I confess myself deserving death; Shall I confess that the enormities, The wrongs Agesilaus dared commit, From me derived their origin; that I In him a harbinger of tyranny Dared to create; that I, by his means, sought To make a trial of degenerate Sparta. This doubtless will suffice. Death, which thou canst not, Except by treachery, now inflict on me, (Thou seest,) from my fellow citizens Thou wilt obtain it thus, and it will seem To them most just. I thus divest myself Of that same fame which thou canst not take from me, Which gives thee umbrage, and to thee resign it. I die, thou reignest; both will be contented. The throne will not invalidate thy fame; Though to the tomb I carry infamy, Still unimpair'd to that tomb shall I bear My only hope, that Sparta by that means Shall rise again to renovated life. Le. Dost deem me so corrupt? Agis. I deem thee great; Since I account thee fit to consummate My mighty projects ... Le. Shall I lend a hand To thy pernicious, impious designs? ... Agis. Thou wilt be utterly from envy freed When I am dead; and thou may'st then fulfil, To thy advantage, and to that of Sparta, My mighty purposes. Oh, do thou dare T'appear thyself exalted in my greatness: Envious wert thou; now do thou wholly hide Thy own original baseness with my blood. Lift up thy soul to an unhoped-for greatness, And make thyself the equal of thy throne. Le. The acclamation of the citizens Already has abundantly raised me Above thyself; but, pardoning thee, if this Sparta concede to me, will give me yet Fuller ascendancy o'er thee. Meanwhile Let me present thee now, for needs I must, To Sparta.—Hast thou aught else to impart? Agis. This only, that thou know'st not how to be Vicious, nor know'st how to dissemble virtue. Le. Now that thou hast imparted all thy thoughts, Or ere th'asylum once more rescue thee From Sparta's reach, I think myself constrain'd To drag thee to a prison.—Guards, advance. Agis. I in a prison more securely feel Than thou upon a throne. By Sparta, we Shall both be heard; nor face to face canst thou Before me stand.—Thou ruinest thyself If thou in prison kill me; this thou knowest. Oh think, and think again; to save thyself, And murder me, no means to thee remain, Save those which heretofore I pointed out. SCENE THE THIRD. Leonidas. Le. At last I've caught him. Many obstacles, 'Tis true, and mighty dangers, I confront: Yet will I, yes, though even at the risk Of my own detriment, yet will I slay This haughty importuning demagogue. But by his death I shall accomplish nothing, If first I do not rob him of his fame: This can alone perpetuate my sway.— Alas! I feel it e'en to agony!— Nor can I give it utterance; when he speaks, A permeating ray of genuine truth Illumes my bosom, and almost subdues me ... Ah no! it tears and maddens my vex'd heart, That insupportable and stern parade Of hated virtue! Let him die; yes, perish ... E'en if t'extinguish him my life I forfeit. SCENE THE FOURTH. Agiziade, Leonidas, Agesistrata. Agi. Father, and is it true? ... by treacherous wiles Hast thou to soldiers hands my spouse ... Ages. Is this Thy promised faith, Leonidas? Le. What faith? What have I promised? I have pledged my faith To Sparta, but to Agis never. Agi. Ah! Beloved father, to thy daughter grant ... Alas! ... Ages. Spontaneously did he not quit The place of refuge? Did he not come forth, Alone, unarm'd, and of his own accord, To treat with thee of peace? And thou, meanwhile, Dost instigate thy parasites to drag him Within a prison? violating thus The honour of a king, and, more than this, The express will of Sparta? ... Infamous ... Le. Oh ladies, to divert me from my will, Tears and reproaches equally are vain. I am the first of Sparta's magistrates, And not her tyrant. The ephori and Sparta Should now pass judgment on the guilty Agis; The ephori and Sparta should restore him, If innocent, to his suspended rank, Ne'er would it have been possible to prove him Guilty or innocent, if he persisted To seek th'interposition of the people, Or an asylum in the temple's walls. 'Tis time, high time, that Sparta should be freed From the distraction of suspense, produced By knowing not, if she does, as she ought, Possess two monarchs, or if one is wanting. Agi. Ah father! ... Agis rescues thee from death, And thou that Agis draggest to a prison? On him hast thou bestow'd thy daughter's hand, And yet would'st rob him of his fame? Though guilty, (Which he is not,) thou shouldest be the first To interpose in his behalf. I gave To thee no dubious trial of my love In thy adversity: and now from Agis Nothing, in his adversity, can wrest me: To doom thy daughter with thy son-in-law To chains, or to release him from those chains, Art thou constrain'd: nor menaces, nor prayers, Shall e'er persuade me to abandon him. Nor canst thou wreak a vengeance on his head, Which shall not equally rebound on me: Thou, thou must shed that very daughter's blood, Who, to accompany thee in banishment, Her husband, and her children, and her throne, And her beloved country, sacrificed. Ages. Oh thou indeed not his, but my true daughter! Thou Spartan wife and daughter, thou in vain Appealest to a father not a Spartan.— Base envy, and still baser thirst of vengeance, Close both his heart and lips.—What could'st thou say? ... Thou, oh Leonidas, within thy heart Hast sworn th'entire destruction of my son, I know thou hast; and equally I know All, all thy impious stratagems. But yet If thou on both of us should'st death inflict, (For my existence and my son's are one,) In vain thou hopest to destroy our fame. Thine own by this means ... but what do I say? Art thou possess'd of fame?—No other object Did thy heart e'er propose, than to preserve And to augment thy riches by the throne. Thou in Seleucus' court becam'st at once Accomplish'd in the art of avarice, And that of wasting blood. A Persian thou, Reignest in Sparta: hence thou dost abhor The equality of citizens, from whence New virtues soon would rise; whence thou once more Would'st be for ever from the throne expell'd: Nor dare thy heart aspire beyond that throne. Le. Nor thy reproaches can exasperate, Nor thy just sorrows mollify my soul. Sparta, and not myself, impeaches Agis, And summons him to exculpate himself. Towards him no other force will I adopt, (Nor could I if I would,) except to take From him all means by which he would evade Just chastisement ... Ages. Just?—Tell me, would'st thou dare To all-assembled Sparta, in this forum, Here to present him, from the terror free Of thy arm'd satellites? ... Le. I know not yet The judgment of the ephori; but ... Ages. Thine Is too well known to me! Let Agis be Brought to the presence of collected Sparta, Not of the mercenary ephori, Or to his presence Sparta will repair. If thou destroy me not before my son, Although a powerless defenceless lady, This I protest to thee shall be accomplish'd. SCENE THE FIFTH. Leonidas, Agiziade. Agi. I will not, father, from thy side depart, Nor at thy footsteps will I cease to kneel, Nor to embrace thy knees, till thou once more Restore to me my husband; or till thou With thy own hand join me with him in death. Le. Beloved daughter, rise! oh never more Do thou depart from me, I wish nought else. Thou hast with me magnanimously shared The many outrages of adverse fortune; Hence is it just, that thou a partner be In my prosperity: no one shall be Over my heart more prevalent than thou: Thee, as my representative, I make The arbitress of Sparta:—nor without thee ... Agi. What words are these? 'Tis Agis I demand Agis, and nought besides. Thou gav'st him to me And thou canst never take him from me, no, If thou take not my life; never canst thou From Sparta take him, without dreadful stain Of violence as a king, and as a man, Of a denaturalized and cruel heart. Le. How canst thou thus be wilfully deceived? That he is guilty, art thou not convinced? But grant that he is guiltless, thou know'st well, In either case, he is not in my power. Th'ephori ought to hear him, ought to judge him: Nor, for his detriment, or his advantage, Can I, unaided, any thing perform. Agi. Thou art a father; and thou lovest me; Thou hast already seen my filial love Brought to a cruel test; and can it be That thou would'st now dissemble with thy daughter?— By treacherous arts erewhile hadst thou the power Unaided, to immure him in a prison? And, being innocent, canst thou not save him? Ah, force me not to think thee ... Le. What avails it? In this I can do nothing: furthermore, 'Tis needful that without delay I give To th'ephori, not only an account Of my own actions, but of those of Agis. Agi. Ah no! I will not quit thee: nor canst thou A cruel order give, that will not fall, At least in part, upon thy daughter ... Le. Cease; Return thou to my palace ... Agi. I go with thee. All wilt thou do, all oughtest thou to do, Oh father, for thy innocent son-in-law Who saved thy life ... Ah, no! thou canst not slay him, If first thou wilt not murder thy own daughter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. The Confines of the Spartan Prison. Leonidas, Anpharus. The People, who from time to time introduce themselves. An. Full late thou comest; and the time is pressing. Le. The father must account for this delay: I was erewhile compell'd t'accompany My daughter's footsteps even to the palace. With such an agony of grief she wept For Agis, that I found it difficult To tear her from my side. Her wretchedness Hath made no slight impression on my heart. An. What? Art thou troubled? Art thou overwhelm'd? Perchance thou carest for thy daughter more Than for thy vengeance? Le. Agis I abhor Far more intensely than I love the throne: But yet my daughter's weeping and complaints Afflict my heart.—Now let me think of action: Are all things by thy vigilance disposed? An. Dost thou not see? Within these spacious confines Of Sparta's prison, it appear'd to me Our seats might fitly be arranged; the place, Less ample than the forum, will contain Less of the dregs of Sparta: but, however, As many here may introduce themselves, As the completion of our views require, At every entrance centinels I've placed, And have in numbers mingled our adherents— Behold, the place already is half fill'd; Nor are there scarcely any of our foes. As yet the tidings are not fully spread Of the great trial: and I hope that all Will be accomplish'd ere th'audacious mother Comes to disturb it with her headstrong train. Le. But art thou sure that from such promptitude Danger may not result? An. No trifling force, Besides our dignity, the cause supports. There will be need of special circumspection In detailing the charges; we must seem Just to ourselves, yet of the people's good, More than our own, tenacious advocates. Some tumult may arise; to frustrate this Precautionary schemes are laid. For us It will suffice, that Agis from these walls No more depart alive. To counteract The first audacious movements of the people, Our friends among the citizens, thy soldiers, The influence of the ephori, and last Thy own audacity, may well suffice. Time is meanwhile ensured; and we shall have From time entire success ... Le. Behold the senate, And all the ephori: the populace In numbers follow them, and they appear Not turbulent in aspect; nay, they seem Pleased at the accusation to assist Of a subverting monarch. Courage, courage. While with insinuating flatteries, And opportune, their fancies I allure, Do thou the prison enter, and forthwith, Agis, well guarded, to our presence bring. SCENE THE SECOND. Leonidas, People, Ephori, Senators: each one placed according to his rank. Le. Praise to the gods! I see collected here The real citizens; and not confused With the audacious, turbid, abject people, Who, with their numbers, strive to implicate You in their error, spite of your consent. A spectacle unprecedented, now Attracts the eyes of universal Sparta; The most important that can ever be By a free man beheld. A king of yours Charged by your ephori, and before you Accused. His accusation you will hear, His pleading, and the final judgment given, In which yourselves, I hope, will bear a part. I, though a king, with joy announce it to you. Ah! I had not such fate on that dire day, Fatal to me, to Sparta not propitious, In which, an exile, from my throne degraded, Forlorn I wander'd, doubtful of my life. By guilty violence was I oppress'd, Unheard and unaccused; yet more dismay, Than from my unjust banishment, my heart Endured from the subversion of the laws, And from the imminent calamities, Which threatened Sparta when I left her walls. At last yourselves convinced of your misfortunes, Once more reseated me upon the throne, And, at the same time, Sparta's outraged laws: Agesilaus, and Cleombrotus, And the bribed ephori, their partizans, Inimical to Sparta, ye proscribed. Agis remains: there are who think him guiltless; And perhaps he is so. But meanwhile I wish'd His person to secure, nor, doing this, Do I propose in his imprisonment A further purpose than to clear his fame. If he were once convicted of offence, Ye should first hear me for my son-in-law Pardon implore: his inexperienced youth Must, in your judgment, as it does in mine, Make him appear not undeserving pity. Ephori, senators, and citizens, Your sacred legislative majesty Never aspired to exercise a right Nobler than this discretionary power. To-day you ascertain your monarch's faults, And pardon them: for I indeed to-day Submit to your inspection all my deeds. It seems to me that this is no light proof Of my pure heart and equitable rule; And to afford to you that proof I pant. Let Agis by Leonidas be taught To tremble at the laws.—But see, already Agis presents himself at your tribunal: Behold I sit in silence: I await, Myself a citizen, from fellow citizens The termination of this lofty process. With all my powers I swear to countenance Whate'er it be, your free, unanimous, Your sacred, and immutable decision. SCENE THE THIRD. Anpharus, Agis amidst Guards, Leonidas, People, Ephori, Senators. An. Ephori, Spartans, king, he, whom I drag Before the true tribunal of my country, Is Agis of Eudamidas. Erewhile He, with Leonidas, o'er Sparta reign'd; Him afterwards he banish'd from the throne, And a new colleague to himself assumed, Cleombrotus. It seem'd to you expedient To reinstate Leonidas, who thence Resumed the sceptre from Cleombrotus. Then to the sacred limits of th'asylum This Agis fled; wherefore, himself will tell you. While there immured, no longer was he king, The throne he had abandon'd: yet not thence Became he private; he had not laid down His dignity, nor was it taken from him. Not guiltless, since he fled to an asylum; Not guilty, since he never was accused. The gods of Sparta have delivered him To you to-day, although by none of us Th'asylum which he chose has been prophaned. Hence I accuse him now before you all Of changed, betray'd, and violated laws; Of stratagems despotically used Against Leonidas, and the ephori; Of arbitrary views, as instruments To whose success the bribed rebellious dregs Of Spartan profligates, he strove to gain. And, lastly, to concentrate in one charge All his offences, I accuse him to you Of having violated and betray'd The delegated majesty of Sparta. Agis. Truly a solemn and imposing pomp Is this: but why in such an exigence Is not collected Sparta here convened? Why, as th'accused are always wont to be, Am I not to the forum led?—'Tis true I see the ephori, a king is here, And I behold a shadow of the senate. But yet, as far as I can cast my eyes, I see no citizens, except a few, Powerful, and mingled with arm'd satellites. The majesty of universal Sparta May this indeed be deem'd? I, not alone, Would have all Sparta, but all Greece collected, To hear me vindicate my innocence. Now since within your bosom there does dwell Such plenary conviction of my guilt, Say wherefore is it that you wrest from me, With such a great proportion of my hearers, At the same time such great part of my shame? Le. Far as the place permits, thou seest here A multitude of citizens assembled.— To bring thee from the confines of the prison Would implicate too much, as thou know'st well, The ephori's stern dignity; too much, If thou be'st innocent, thy innocence. Sparta heard thee, defending thy retreat, Erewhile adduce, that thus thou would'st remove All pretext of disturbance, all pretence For sanguinary measures, from the people: Would'st thou amid that people's violence, And turbulent vociferation, go, A quiet and free judgment to obtain? Agis. A quiet judgment, and for you the safest, Would it have been at once to have dispatch'd The executioner where I'm imprison'd: But far less quiet will this process prove Than you desire. Terror prompts not my words; No; of my destiny already sure, The forum and this place to me are one. I, without hearing it, my sentence know: But I indeed shall never thence receive A deeper injury, than that which I Long in my heart have fix'd to have from you.— Judges, spectators, whosoe'er you be, I now forewarn you all, that I, condemn'd, And slain, within these walls, shall not by death, As fain I would do, peace restore to you: Nor you, by dragging me to death, for this Remain in safety.—I await my doom Undaunted. Be the accusations heard ... An. I, in the name of th'ephori, address thee; Listen to me; Agis, didst thou not drive, Unheard by thee, Leonidas to exile? Agis. He, to the seat of judgment duly summon'd, Chose rather to escape. Le. Summon'd I was, I cannot contradict, but to confront A virulent tumultuary rabble.— Can this be judgment, this? .. Agis. As much as this, At least. To thee was flight allow'd: and thence Thou never wert imprison'd. Heretofore Means of escape solicited my choice, But to the prison willingly I went, And willingly in judgment I appear: Whate'er that judgment is, I fear it not. I wish'd it, and exult in its conclusion; And in thus making myself heard exult. An. Didst thou not violate thy country's laws? Agis. The sacred institutes of great Lycurgus, In their primæval purity, I wish'd To re-establish: they were ne'er repeal'd, But for a long time had been unobserved. To such a just and generous design Leonidas opposed: first artfully, Then counteracted my designs by force; But both were ineffectual: thus subdued More by his own shame than the force of others, He, as the lesser evil, on himself Exile imposed. Let him himself confess, If injury to me he can impute, Or life and safety. Sparta with one voice, At his departure, all his actions blamed, All mine applauded. Greedy creditors Were then abolish'd; wealth was equalized; With luxury, the vices in her train, And torpid indolence, from Sparta fled; And lo! primæval liberty and virtue At once resumed their sway. Dare any here Deny th'assertion?—Of my short-lived reign, After the flight of your Leonidas, Behold the crimes. An. Dar'st thou perchance deny, That by the bait of such professions caught, A speedy desolation overwhelm'd The cheated citizens? The fields, though promised, Never divided; wealthy men impoverish'd; The poor dissatisfied; and both oppress'd. Wilt thou deny, too, that to transgress'd laws, Such as thou deemest ours, did not succeed Thy cruel unparticipated sway?— A sway the more pernicious, since it made, To cover its exorbitant designs, A specious pretext of pretended laws. Agis. Whilst I for your sakes for the camp left Sparta, Whilst to th'Etolians in arms I shew'd, To their dismay, regenerate Spartans arm'd, From one of th'ephori become a tyrant, Agesilaus, in my absence, here, To wicked purposes disgraced his power. Am I responsible for his misdeeds? I willingly accept their punishment, Provided that my country reap the fruit Of my imperfect virtues; virtues which You cannot controvert, though full, towards me, Of malice and uncharitable thoughts.— The restoration of Lycurgus' laws Has not offended you: (in this alone I dared to innovate) but the harsh schemes Of Agesilaus. What then remains for you, But to kill me, and to pursue my plans? An. Say'st thou Agesilaus suborn'd thee To ruin Sparta? Agis. To regenerate Sparta I of my own accord address'd myself, Because I am a Spartan. An. Say, dost thou For a true king Leonidas acknowledge? Agis. Leonidas, a Spartan, I acknowledge, Who in Thermopylæ, for Sparta's sake, Fell with three hundred Spartans. An. Answer'st thou In such a manner? Dost thou thus contemn The ephori's, the senate's majesty? Agis. In answering thus I venerate and adore The majesty of Sparta. An. Guilty then Thou dost confess thyself? Agis. Deem'st thou me so, Thou who accusest me?—Let us conclude, Let us conclude this legislative juggling. Thou dost accuse me; I refute the charges. I hither came to prove to those that hate me, That I, a citizen and king, as far As is consistent with the conscious pride Of innocence, spontaneously submitted E'en to the malversation of the laws.— Now here, whoe'er you be, hear my last words. An. What more is there to hear? Agis. Much; but express'd In a few words. An. Thou oughtest not to speak ... Agis. Thou, one of the ephori, dost thou not know The laws, or not remember them? The accused Address their country, if they wish to do it. Then listen to me, thou, and hold thy peace.— And you, oh Spartans, hear.—Of many things You're not inform'd at all, or misinform'd: Agesilaus' deeds, the cries of Anpharus, My silence, and Leonidas's arts, Have all by turns deceived you. We are all Now come to such a pitch, that to set free Each one from error, it is requisite That Agis perish. I, with my own hand, Already on myself might have bestow'd An independent and becoming death. But this escape from life had render'd me Guilty in your esteem. I was, and am, Fully persuaded in my inmost heart, That from the sentence, be it what it may, Beneath whose weight I fall, no infamy Can ever on myself reverberate. Thence to permit myself hither to be Before my foes dragg'd living, was my choice, And here I stand. That death I do not fear, Ye yourselves will behold. I might to you, If so I would, yet dearly sell my life. The terrible cries of the indignant people Will quickly make this known to you: in short, That I esteem at a far higher rate My country than myself, soon will my death Convince you.—I exhort, nay, I conjure you, Sparta's redemption and your own to win From my atoning blood. The lands, the wealth, That now infatuate your phantasy, Lodged in the hands of few, injure alike Those who possess and those who covet them; Those lands, that wealth, since ye would not divide Them with your fellow-citizens, from you Shall be, and ere long, wrested by your foes. The people, deem'd so vile, since mendicant; The Spartan people hating you, ye rich, Ye who are stronger even than the laws, Numerous that people is; 'tis goaded on By fierce necessity. This very people May constitute at once their country's splendour, And your salvation, if ye will reflect That they, as well as you, are citizens Of Sparta, children of the great Lycurgus. If otherwise, they will annihilate Sparta, themselves, and you. Now is the time, Trust to my words, mature for such a change; The Gods forbid that I should witness it; But they decree its advent: Agis' blood Is indispensable to hasten it; And Agis yields that blood. Pity for you, Not for myself, I feel. These are the words Of one whose only object is to die; Who to the tomb carries no other wish Except to save his country. Far beyond The reach of malice is the name of Agis: It is not needful to make me illustrious That others give effect to my designs; Rather it lessens my renown in part That others should succeed where I have fail'd. Be then the punishment assign'd to me The final ebullition of your rage; And the first fruit of your exhausted malice The restoration of primæval virtue; The re-establishment of the divine And lofty institutions of Lycurgus, And a true Spartan emulation raised For freedom, arms, and patriotic love. People. Great is the soul of Agis: we have been, Perchance, deceived ... An. Yes, ye are deceived By these seditious falsehoods. Agis. Ephori, What now remains for you to say I know.— I of a royal citizen, at length, The latest functions fully have accomplish'd. I to my prison go, from whence henceforth Nought but the name of Agis shall escape. SCENE THE FOURTH. Leonidas, Anpharus, People, Ephori, Senators. People. He speaks not as a culprit: he excites Involuntary wonder and compassion. Le. 'Tis true, oh Spartans: by Agesilaus He was seduced; his crime appears to be Worthy of pardon. I myself from you Entreat it for my son-in-law; for him That rescued me from death ... An. Leonidas, Before the senate and the ephori Thou standest now; and these thou should'st address. Thy private arguments from public guilt Wrest not the penalty; nor pardon ever Precedes conviction. Le. I will never hear, Much less myself pronounce, his punishment. I will not, no, although he merit it, Ever participate in Agis' death. From his retreat to drag him, to convict him, Before the magistrates, to this alone Duty persuaded me, and this I've done: No more remains, inimical towards him, For me to do.—Ah! if the people's voice, And royal prayers avail to influence The senate and the ephori, in them We of their clemency shall soon behold A noble and a memorable proof. SCENE THE FIFTH. Anpharus, People, Ephori, Senators. An. A foe magnanimous, the best of fathers, A perfect citizen, Leonidas, Has well his task accomplish'd; it remains For us to accomplish ours.—Agis stands Convicted of high-treason: Ephori, Say what just punishment awaits him. Ephori. Death. People. Ephori, all of us implore your pity; If he henceforward trouble not the state. An. Heard ye those terrible and menacing shouts This way approaching? In his cause once more The people rise already. While he lives Can Sparta rest? 'Tis folly to believe it. Ephori. Die! let him perish, the rebellious traitor! Let Agis die! ... An. Soon shall ye be obeyed.— Meanwhile, oh citizens, avoid at present To meet the infatuated guilty people. But let us with becoming boldness, we, The ephori, the majesty of Sparta, Present ourselves.—Guards, intercept the passage. Let us depart; and let our aspect be Nor timid nor elate. A mark'd indifference Soon makes the people recollect themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Inside of the Prison of Sparta. Agis. Agis. I hear tremendous howlings, and a loud Tumultuary uproar round my prison.— Ye Deities of Sparta save my country!— It grieves me that I did not keep a sword, Whence, with my hands, I might at once extinguish My own and Sparta's troubles at a blow. Those whom Leonidas will send to slay me, Cannot delay much longer.—Much-loved children ... My mother, ... my beloved spouse, ... farewell ... No more shall I behold you! ... I bequeathe To you, tender remembrance of myself ... But for my mother's destiny I tremble: She's in the tyrant's power ... What do I hear? Who comes? The prison opens! ... Who is this? ... My consort? ... SCENE THE SECOND. Agis, Agiziade. Agi. I am with thee, much-loved Agis ... I from the palace of my father fled, Where I, as in a prison, was immured.— The people cleared for me the path that led To this foul dungeon; and the very guards Had not the heart my entrance to forbid.— At length I am with thee ... Oh spouse, I come, If it be possible, to rescue thee, Or with thee to expire. Agis. Beloved wife! ... My heart thou rendest ... How much joy ... and pain ... Thy presence brings me ... To preserve my life, (For by the death of many citizens I, if I would, might do it) thy true love Alone could influence me. But thou know'st well I ought not to prefer thee to my country, Nor would'st thou that I did it. Leave me then To die; preserve thy own life; and defend Those precious pledges of our love, our children ... Agi. Vainly should I attempt to rescue them From the fierce hatred of Leonidas: Unnatural father! in his prosperous state I know him now without disguise; erewhile In his adversity I was deceived. No weapons now remain to me but tears; These he despises: Sparta, with her arms, Or nothing else, our children can preserve From his atrocious rage.—But thou, at least, Should'st prove thyself a father, and defend Thy own life for thy offspring ... Agis. Oh my wife! In these last moments what a terrible conflict Dost thou not raise within me? Thou know'st well I love my children; but their death is yet Uncertain; and 'tis certain that in streams The blood of Sparta's citizens would flow If I attempted force. And these and those Are both my children; but the people are His dearest children in a just king's sight.— O lady, if thou darest to survive me, Thou canst defend them better than myself! That courage, tender and sublime at once, Which made thee the companion of thy father; That courage which induced thee to become The faithful friend of my adversity; That will suffice to be a guide to thee To avert destruction from their innocent lives. Guilty and fierce as is Leonidas, He is thy father: if thy little ones Thou claspest in thy arms; if thy pure breast Become a refuge to their innocence, He cannot have the heart to murder them. Ah! run from hence, fly to thy tottering babes, As their defender watch; for them live on, Or only die with them; for if they perish, Nothing compels thee then to drag on life. Agi. Alas! ... what shall I do? ... If I should leave thee ... My barbarous father would by force keep me In life; ... and what a life! ... Widow'd from thee ... But even if he let our children live, ... Their throne would then be taken from them ... Ah! I will expire with thee ... Agis. Oh lady, hear me, and be pacified ... Would'st thou be less heroic as a mother, Than as a daughter? Thou fear'dst not my wrath, The day that thou accompani'dst thy father: Thy children didst thou for his sake desert, And thy beloved consort: would'st thou now, When thou dost leave him for thy children's sake, Tremble at that same father? Thou with them May'st fly from hence: thou hast t'oppose to him Efficient weapons, thy own innocence: Lastly, thou hast a thousand means to try, Ere thou resolve on death. Ah! I conjure thee, Beloved consort, try them; once again Resume thy lofty heart; nor weaken mine With female lamentations. Wouldest thou That I expired in tears? Ah, no!—If thou Art worthy Agis, do not thou force me To make that Agis of himself unworthy. Agi. Say, was paternal fondness ever deem'd Unworthy of a father, to prefer His children to himself? ... Agis. Before our children Our country must be loved. For a long time My blood have I deem'd consecrate to her; Thine, if it needful be, should'st thou devote To our beloved children: but thou givest, If thou for their sakes dost consent to live, To them, and to myself, a higher proof Of thy regard. Thy tears may yet do much; More than thou dost imagine: in the people Will they, if in Leonidas they do not, Excite compassion; and to them to save, E'en without loss of blood, my little ones, Will be most easy. Finally, reflect, That Agis wholly dies not while thou livest. I, in a vulgar woman, should admire, As proof at once of passionate regard And sublime heroism, the fixed will Not to survive her husband; but I hope, Nay I demand from thee, and thou the wife Of Agis, by that union with myself, Art pledged, intrepidly, to more than death,— A life of sorrow for thy children's sake ... Weeping I ask it of thee; may these tears Sink in thy heart ... Ah! for thyself alone, And for our children, hast thou seen at length Thy Agis weep. Agi. Irrevocably then Hast thou decreed to die? ... Agis. Thou canst not doubt My innocence.—Receive my last embrace; And take it, in my name, to our dear children. Tell them, that for my country's sake I die; Tell them that if, as adults, to my throne They e'er should come, they, for their father's death, No other vengeance ever must inflict, Than, imitating him, to renovate The sublime institutes of great Lycurgus: And, if in this, as I have done, should they Encounter adverse fates, bid them, like me, In this immortalizing enterprize, As men of valour sacrifice their lives. Agi. I cannot speak ... Must I abandon thee? ... Agis. A faithful counsellor, in my worthy mother, Wilt thou possess, if still her life be spared!— Now go; ah leave me; go.—A wife, a queen, A mother, Spartan, and a citizen Art thou; these lofty characters support. Agi. Oh heaven! ... Eternally ... Agis. Cease, cease, I pray thee. Agi. My tottering feet scarcely support my frame. Agis. Ah come! when once thou hast departed hence, Thou soon wilt find protection and support. Agi. Oh misery! ... The iron gate unfolds ... Agis. Guards, I consign to you your monarch's daughter. Agi. Agis ... Ah cruel! ... I will never quit him ... Agis! ... farewell ... farewell ... SCENE THE THIRD. Agis. Agis. Ah wretched me! ... How many deaths must I in one endure? ... That grief which husbands and which fathers feel, What grief can ever equal?—Sparta, Sparta, How much thou costest me! ... Leonidas Is yet a father: in my heart I feel A grateful presage that he will consign My children to his daughter.—Cease my tears.— My death is now approaching. As a Spartan, And as an innocent king, I ought to die ... Oh death, how tardy are thy steps!—But yet, Behold, again I hear my prison gate Grate on its hinges? ... And I also hear The shouts redoubled round these walls! ... What now Can this portend? ... Whom do I see? ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Agesistrata, Agis. Agis. ... Oh heavens! ... Oh mother! ... Ages. Son, in this thy hour of need, To thee thy mother never could be wanting. A liberty, that's worthy of ourselves, I bring thee.—In a far different shape To thee I would have yielded it; but when There was a time for this, thou didst thyself Divest me of all means t'accomplish it. Agis. What would'st thou with these Spartan cries obtain? ... Ages. In vain doth Sparta cry. The treacherous tyrant The place hath so well guarded with his soldiers, That our adherents nothing can perform: In vain do they attempt to force their ranks; Inert, abash'd, disgraced, discomfited, They are repell'd. Among our impious foes Forward I darted; from behind I heard Fierce voices in my favour, which exclaim'd, “Miscreants! dare you to interdict approach “To Agis' mother?” ... Anpharus then saw me; Made them give way to me, and here I'm driven. Agis. Perfidious! He would also make thee captive. Ah, mother! To what useless risk for me! ... Ages. Risk! dost thou say? Beside my son, I come To certain death. Behold, in proof of this, The gift I bring. Agis. A sword!—Oh genuine mother!— My breast did not contain another wish Than to possess a sword to rescue Sparta, And to withdraw myself from death-wounds, given By an ignoble hand: and thou, oh joy! Bringest one to me!—Give it me ... Ages. Chuse thou: There are two swords; mine is the one thou leavest. Agis. Oh heaven! ... and wilt thou? ... Ages. Dost thou then account me Mother of Agis, or a vulgar woman? Few years at best remain for me to live: Sparta, which thou in vain dost hope to save, Already is enthrall'd: if she remain, Thy mother is Leonidas's slave. Now speak; I hear thee: darest thou council me On such conditions to consent to live? Agis. What can I say? I am a son.—Oh mother, Suffer me first to die: although enslaved, Sparta is not extinct; hence other hands May liberate her yet. Perchance my blood To freedom may restore her: but if I, Abject, in order not to shed my own, Had let the citizens in my defence Lavish their blood, Sparta had been no more. Ages. Sparta too certainly expires with thee.— And wouldest thou that I, a Spartan mother, Survive my son and country?—Son, embrace me. Agis. Oh mother! ... Thou surpassest even me In dignity of soul.—Now give to me, And take the last embrace. I dare not weep In thus embracing thee; for in thine eyes I see thy tears by fortitude restrain'd. Ages. My Agis, ... thou indeed art worthy Sparta ... And I of thee am worthy.—Once again Let me embrace thee ... Whence this deafening noise? SCENE THE FIFTH. Leonidas, Anpharus, Soldiers with drawn swords. Agis, Agesistrata. Le. At length we are victorious. Ages. What's your purpose? Agis. Ah! do not leave my side. An. Soldiers, your swords At Agis first, then at his mother, aim. The soldiers approach Agis. Agis. Like me, conceal thy weapon for awhile; Let us await their coming, and be silent. The soldiers, seeing Agis immoveably expect them, all of them pause at once. An. Who now restrains you? Why delay ye thus? Tear them asunder instantly by force. Agis. Which of you, which, would dare lay hands on us?— Royal Leonidas, dost thou behold? Even thy own bribed soldiers, stupified, Immoveable, in Agis' presence stand.— But I will soon deliver thee from fear. One thing alone do I demand of thee. Le. It is ... Agis. That thou attentively would'st watch Thy daughter, that she imitate me not. Le. Is then her love for thee so strong? Agis. More strong Than thy abhorrence.—But she loves thee too, And hath given proof of it; and, finally, Thou art her father: my last words are these; He brandishes his sword aloft, and kills himself.— I die—May Sparta ... only ... profit by it ... An. He has a sword! Ages. Two swords I brought. She also discovers her sword, and kills herself.—Oh son! I follow thee; and fall ... upon thee ... dead. Le. I am struck dumb with terror and with wonder ... Ah, what will Sparta say? ... An. Their lifeless bodies Should from the people be conceal'd ... Le. Ah, never! From our own eyes we never can conceal them.</field>
