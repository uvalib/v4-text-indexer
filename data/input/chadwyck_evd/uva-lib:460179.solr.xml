      <field name="fulltext">CLEONICE. Princess of Bithynia. A Tragedy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO MRS. VERELST, AS A SINCERE MARK OF RESPECT, THIS TRAGEDY IS DEDICATED, BY HER MOST OBEDIENT, HUMBLE SERVANT, THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by T. Vaughan, Esq.âSpoken by Mr. Bensley. Tell me, ye gods, ye arbiters of wit, Who rule the heavens, or who lead the pit, [Addressing the gallery and pit. Whence comes it, in an age refin'd by taste, By science polish'd, and by judgment chaste, We see the muse, in dignity sublime, Led on by prologue, ape-ing pantomime? Whose sportive fancy, and whose comic skill, All must applaudâwhere Roscius guides the quill; Yet when Melpomene in grief appears, Her suff'ring virtue bath'd in sorrow's tears, From tyrant laws, or jealous love oppress'd, Swelling with silence in her tortur'd breast, How can the heart her genial impulse shew, Feel as she feels, or weep another's woe; When gay Thalia has so late possess'd The laughing transports of the human breast? Let each her province keep, let jocund mirth To Epilogue alone give happy birth; Ease the struck soul from ev'ry anxious fear, And wipe from beauty's cheek the silent tear. Twice Metastasio's wings have borne our bayes, And safely brought him o'er the critic seas; Fir'd with success, he dares this awful night, Cheer'd by your smiles to take a bolder flight; Nor longer stoop beneath a foreign shade, Like Dian shining from a borrow'd aid; But comes impregnate with Icarian pride, To stretch his pinions, and forsake his guide; Yet doubtful flies, lest vapours damp his force, And one black cloud should stop his airy course, To awful heights his proud ambition soars, And the dread regions of applause explores; No sun he fearsâbut courts its warmest ray, 'Tis yours to raiseâor sink him in the sea. Let Candour then proceed to try the cause, That Magna Charta of dramatic laws!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by a Friend, to have been spoken in the character of the Tragic Muse. Designed for Mrs. Barry. Judges of genius! from whose hands a bard This night awaits the laurel of reward! To you, the Tragic Muse, in Britain's name, Comes to announce the merits of his claim. 'Tis I have led him timorous to this field, And bade him dare his country's gauntlet wield; Bade him aspire to vault her fiery breed, Nor humbly stoop to mount the manag'd steed. Long had I seen his patient merit toil, In culling chaplets from a foreign soil; Whilst, here, transplanted, by his skilful hand, Italia's honours bloom'd in Albion's land. Long had I mark'd, as such exotic boughs Content he wove to veil his modest brows, A spirit that in paths untrod before Might snatch the nobler foilage of this shore. Pleas'd with the hopes, that I had now descry'd A future son, from whom the buskin's pride To this my favourite isle, again might rise; I touch'd his ear, and pointed out the prize.â âWither my honours in this clime (I said) âBuds here no bounteous leaf to deck thy head? âAre these once fostering skies so over-cast, âThat genius dares not brave th'inclement blast? âCome, let me lead thee, where my sons of yore âIn fancy's fields amass'd their laureate store: âWith active powers, aloft, bestrode the clouds âInspir'd by kind acclaims of shouting crowds. âTurn thee, where Shakspere wav'd the mystic rod, âAnd saw a new creation wait his nod. âBehold where terror, with eccentric stride, âBursts, like a torrent from the mountain's side! âBehold where gentle pity heaves the sigh, âSluicing the fruitful conduit of the eye! âSee love, at whose approach, the airy wiles âOf mirth and freedom, or the jocund smiles âOf sweet content, dispers'd in wild affright, âMount on their silken wings and take their flight. âSee jealousy his hideous form uprear, âTine the quick brand, and shake the vengeful spear: âWhile, close behind, fell anguish and disdain âStalk sullen by, and swell his gloomy train. âMark where despair points to some distant ground, âOn blasted yews, where night-birds shriek around, âWhere yawning tombs add horror to the night, âAnd meteors flash their momentary light. âHere mark thyself, what various objects rise, âNor trust the medium of another's eyes.â I spokeâand genius strait began to spread His ready plumage, and my voice obey'd, Adventurous, thence, he dares this night aspire To stamp the vivid scene with native fire. 'Tis yours, ye Britons, then, with kind applause, To fan the flame I kindled in your cause: Nor be it said, when on your mercy thrown, You foster every spark, but what's your own. From your dread sentence, crown'd with laurels won, I ardently expect to greet a son: The palm I have deposited with you, And trust your hearts to give it where 'tis due.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Gallery.âEnter Teramenes, Agenor. Teramenes. Agenor, still Bithynia must retain The sword unsheath'd, and still remov'd afar, Shall peace, in vain desir'd, mock every hope Of dear domestic happinessâthe leagues Of factious princes, whose associate force Has vex'd this bleeding land, now yield indeed To Lycomedes' arms, or rather shrink Before the genius of your noble friend. Age. Arsetes, bred in distant realms, and long A wanderer o'er the face of earth, must hail The hour that led his steps to tread your soil, And gave him Teramenes for his friend. Tera. Though now the rage of civil strife is past, Full well thou know'st, to-morrow's sun declin'd, His next returning beam lights up the day That ends the truce with Pontus, and demands Our strongest force to meet a mightier foe, In Artabasus. Age. Five returning suns Have chang'd your vernal groves, since as the breath Of Fame declares, your armies met and fought On Hippias' banks, what time your martial powers (Forgive me, if report mislead my tongue) Bow'd to a foreign standard. Tera. Lycomedes, Whose thirst of glory in his vigorous life Compell'd the neighbouring states to bend beneath Bithynia's yoke; when creeping time had clogg'd The vital springs, and kept his age from scenes Of active valour, by his generals still Maintain'd the field, and through the nations spread His martial terrors, till that fatal day, When Hippias, down his current, dy'd with blood. The frequent corse and glittering ensign bore: Then, midst the slaughter, fell a sacrifice To iron war, our king's lamented son; A youth, the early darling of his sire, The soldier's hope, and nursling of the field. Age. Oft have I heard Polemon's name, who brave Unpractis'd arm encounter'd Artabasus, And from his sword received a glorious death. Tera. But though the time's necessity compell'd Bithynia to the truce, still, still the thought Of his Polemon rankled in the bosom Of our afflicted monarch, still the hope, Though distant hope of vengeance, glow'd within, And fed eternal hatred in his soul. While now to Pontus' bounds, his army spreads It's conquering legions, he forgoes the state Of Nicomedias' palace, to reside Amidst this city, whose opposing bulwarks Rise on the kingdom's edge, and dare the foe. Age. Fame speaks your rival great, and gives the praise, Of might and wisdom to the king of Pontus; And more, 't is said, his son, amidst the files Of Rome's immortal legions, distant far From Pontus, learns the rugged trade of war, And gathers laurels in his blooming age, That veterans view with envy: his return Gives earnest of new triumphs. Tera. Let him come; Would yet Arsetes aid Bithynia's cause, His sword, with brave Orontes join'd, whose hand Must sway th'scepter of Bithynia's realm, Might fix th'unsteady wing of victory To Lycomedes' bands. Age. Orontes' valour Your sovereign deems to merit Cleonice, Whose piety forsakes the pomp of courts, The splendid ease of female life, to attend A father's steps, amidst the clang of war. But for Arsetes, thou rememberest well, When first he join'd to thine his social arms, He pledg'd his faith for five returning moons To abide your welcome guest, and now the tenth Wanes in her silver orb. Tera. What says Agenor? My mind, though loth, recalls each circumstance. But still I hop'd Arsetes might be won To breathe our friendly air, still mix'd among Bithynia's warlike sons, now hov'ring o'er The verge of hostile Pontus, when the time And place concurr'd, to pour with sudden inroad The storm of conquest on our hated foe, To avenge a form, a worth so like his ownâ âBut see, he comesâ Enter Arsetes. Belov'd Arsetes, welcome! Youth, at thy presence, buds with bloom renew'd, Such as I was, when, on Arabia's sands, I crush'd the wandering robbers of the desert. Arse. My lord, too partial friendship ever finds New praise for your Arsetes; if I claim Of merit aught, here Heaven receive my thanks, That bade me wield the sword for Lycomedes. Tera. And yet Arsetes now methinks forgets To prize our country's honours; while the bond Of friendship holds no more his changing heart; That heart, which once I press'd with transport here, Which seem'd with mutual transport to receive The love I proffer'd, when my bosom glow'd With warmth of gratitude to him, whose arm Snatch'd Teramenes from impending death, As fierce Lysippus aim'd the threatening blade At my defenceless head, when you rush'd in, (Till then unknown) and sav'd me from the foe. Arse. 'T was sure some happy star, that led my steps At that blest momentâif I sav'd the life Of Teramenes, I preserv'd indeed A faithful counsellor for Lycomedes, An army's chief, but for myself a friend. Tera. And wilt thou, my Arsetes, now forsake The bands, that late pursued the glorious task Of conquest, taught by theeânow when the great, Th'important moment comes, on which depends Our monarch's fame, our vengeanceâled by thee And brave Orontes, we have stemm'd the tide Of inbred tumult: every rebel head Now lies subdued, and flush'd with great success, Our soldiers now demand, with loud acclaim, To pour their fury o'er yon hostile bounds, Beneath Arsetes and Orontes. Ars. Heaven Be witness here, compulsive honour long Has challeng'd my departureâyet, till now, I wav'd obedience to the frequent calls Of duty; but the flame of civil broils At length subsiding through your troubled state, I must (forgive me, chief, forgive me, friend) Yield to the powerful voice, and quit Bithynia. By every toil my sword has known in battle, But most the toils I shar'd with Teramenes, Unwilling and compell'd, I leave your clime, And quit a country dearer than my own. Tera. Farewell, Arsetes; think that Teramenes, Feels from his inmost soul the fix'd resolve Of him, whom once he fondly deem'd by fortune, From all mankind selected for his friend. I'll seek the king, no less will he regret Arsetes' loss, whose presence might insure His wish'd revenge, and fix his kingdom's glory. [Exit. Age. Why droops Arsetes? O! discover all Thy secret grief, and let Agenor share it. Arse. Indeed thou dostâmy every thought is thine My other self, my bosom's counsellor! What needs there more to rend my heart, to fill My tortur'd soul, while loitering here I wrong My native soil, the voice of filial duty Chides my delay, yet love, the powerful god Reigns in my breast, and mocks each settled purpose: Come, my Agenor, with thy friendly aid Confirm my thoughts, and teach me yet to tread, Yet to resume the path my feet have left; To quit the land where all my joys are center'd, To tear myself from love and Cleoniceâ âO! never!âneverâ Age. Yet again reflect, Think what you are, to what has Heaven reserv'd Your virtuesâShall a kingdom's heirâ Arse. Go onâ 'T is honest chidingâShall a kingdom's heir, (Thus would'st thou say) on whom th'expecting eyes Of thousands look for happiness, on whom A father fixes every dearest hope To see himself renew'd to distant times, Shall he, forgetting all the claims of glory, Forgetting all the ties of filial duty, Defrauds his longing people of their prince, And from his sire with-hold a darling son? Sayâshall Bithynia's hostile lands detain, From Artabasus' sight his lov'd Pharnaces? O! noâAgenorâthou has fir'd my soul! My father!âyes, I will embrace the knees Of him, whose love reproaches my delay. Yet never, Cleonice, shall this breast Forget its wonted flame:âIs it a crime To adore the sum of all her sex's graces, Though wayward chance has plac'd the hopeless bar Of lineal enmity between our loves? Age. And yet, my prince; the indulgent hand of fate, Perchance may weave your future web of life With threads of brighter dye; even love itself May find a way to clear the gloomy prospect: Discord perhaps may once again extinguish Her hated torch that fires the rival nations, And Cleonice be the bond of peace: Too long, already, strangers have we lived, Alien from friends and home: though Artabasus Sent you beneath my father's guardian care, To learn hard lessons in the school of glory, Yet sure the parent suffer'd in that absence, Which, as a king, his virtue deem'd would raise Your fame, and fit you for a people's weal. Arse. Yes, my Agenor, oft his tenderest greetings Have warn'd me to return, when circling time Had brought the period fix'd for my departure; Or when the pause of arms, or honour's duty Permitted me to quit the host of Rome. Age. And yetâmy princeâ Arse. And yetâtoo true, Agenor, I feel each just reproachâthe land indeed I left, and journey'd o'er a length of soil, When fate (for sure 'twas more than common fortune) Prompted my steps to tread Bithynia's realm, Where Lycomedes wag'd intestine war With rebel arms. Age. Thy generous valour then, Warm'd by the common cause of kings, to assert A prince's rights, forgot thy country's foe. Arse. Full well thou know'st I vow'd to every God, By all the solemn ties that bind mankind, Ne'er to reveal, while in this hostile land My country, or my birth; this urg'd by thee, I swore, when first I told thee my design, To gaze on Cleonice's wondrous charms. Age. Nor vain the cautionâthink, O think, how far It yet imports to keep the mighty secret: Alas! my friend I tremble, had your father Been conscious whether fortune led the steps Of his Pharnaces; could he know the land Of Lycomedes now detains his sonâ Th'idea starts a thousand fears: should now Some dreadful chance betray you to the foe; I shudder at the thoughtâthen let us hence, And to the longing troops of Pontus give A blooming hero, promis'd oft in vain: Then let us hastenâby my father's shade I now adjure youâfor Pharnaces once Rever'd his Tiridatesâ Arse. Witness, Heaven, How dear I held him!âArtabasus only Could claim a nearer duty o'er my heart, The guide, the great example of my youth! Methinks I now recall the fatal day That snatch'd him from usâO, my lov'd Agenor! The scene is present to my eyesâI see The battle rang'd, when to my ardent gaze His hand experienc'd pointed out the files Of rigid war, and taught me where to drive The thunder of the field; when Heaven so will'd, A distant arrow sent with deadly aim, Pierc'd his brave breastâ Age. Then midst the distant fight, It was not given Agenor's hand to close, A dying parent's eyesâ Arse. These arms receiv'd The venerable chiefââTake, take,â (he cry'd) âThis last embraceâstill let the dear remembrance âOf Tiridates' counsels move his prince, âAnd, for my sake, be kind to my Agenor.ââ He could no more, but left in thee his pledge Of truth and amityâsince which my soul Has held thee ever partner of her fame, Her better half, her other Tiridates! [Embrace. Age. I am indeed thy Tiridatesâyes, My father, from thy seats of bliss and peace, See, how thy prince rewards thy loyal faith, And, in his love, supplies a parent's lossâ And yet, forgive me, prince, thy words awake Remembrance of that day for ever mourn'd!â âMy fatherâ Arse. Go, Agenor, since my last Resolves are fix'dâprovide whate'er requires To quit this courtâto quit my Cleonice, Though death is in the thought!âthy piety Reproaches mineâere yet the mounting sun Whose early ray now gilds the face of morn, Attain his mid-day seat, the camp of Pontus Shall see Pharnaces and Agenor. [Exit Agenor. Arse. [Alone.] Yet Be still, my beating heartâO, Cleonice! I feel her nowâInstruct me every God In soothing speech!âO, teach my lips to breathe In gentle sounds, the fatal wordâfarewell! âOrontes here!âand is not this the blest, The destin'd husband of my Cleoniceâ I shall relapseâfor if I thinkâdistraction Ensues, and fame and peace are lost for ever! [Exit. Enter Orontes. Oro. Sure 'twas Arsetes! that malignant planet, That thwarts my course, whene'er my fiery soul Would, eagle-wing'd, stretch her aspiring flight, He soars above me stillâHave I not worn The mask of loyal faith, smooth'd o'er the dark The sullen brow of deep design, with smiles My heart confess'd not?âWhat have I not done, For thee Ambition!âLet not pale Remembrance Review the past, or paint a scene to stagger The sickly resolutionâdeeds long done, That sleep secure from every mortal ken, Are but as shadows in the coward eye Of conscienceâHence!âOrontes' soul disdains The phantoms of remorse.â Enter Zopyrus. Now, my Zopyrusâ Speak; hast thou aught that claims my ear? Zop. I learn That the young stranger who so deeply witch'd The madding multitude, prepares this day To leave Bithynia's court. Oro. It cannot beâ Arsetes!âspeakâwhat at this fated time, When war again unfolds his brazen portals, And Pontus brings to view its crested thousands; A tempting prospect yet untry'd, to prove His swordâIt cannot be! Zop. This hour Agenor Declar'd Arsetes's purpose. Oro. Speed it, gods! Come near, Zopyrus, to thy faithful ear I've oft disclos'd the secrets of my heart, Where Love, but most Ambition holds his sway. This stranger is my baneâI shrink beneath His better geniusâeven the field that once Crown'd this good sword with honours, yields me now But wither'd laurels, which his brow disdains; While the blind herd on him, with full-mouth'd clamour, Lavish their shouts. Zop. Yet fortune has secur'd Your brightest hopesâhas not our king declar'd Orontes, next by birth, ascends the throne? Have not the assembled states confirm'd the right Of just succession? hastening on the steep Of downward life, our king, though high in spirit, Blazing with wasting light, that soon must fail, Shall sudden sink to night, and leave to thee A glorious rising to imperial greatness! Fair Cleonice too shall bless your bed, And with her beauty smooth the toils of empire. Oro. 'T is true, the charms of Cleonice well Might claim the tongue of raptureâyet Zopyrus, While great Ambition's sun lights up my flame, The star of Love looks sickly at his beams. Zop. What more can crown your wish, when Happiness, In all your soul aspires to, soon shall open Her welcome armsâMean-time the king, my lord, Esteems, and holds you high above the rank Of Nicomedia's nobles. Oro. True, Zopyrus; Spite of the tardy warmth of cautious age I've work'd me deep in Lycomedes soul, By more than common zeal to avenge his son. But home-bred faction, spreading through the land, Compell'd us to the hated truce with Pontus: Till now, nine moons elaps'd, this upstart chief Stept in, to bear away the prize of arms Due to my elder sword, while Teramenes With partial eye beheld his every deed, And idoliz'd the work himself had rais'd. Zop. Yet common rumour speaks that friendship holds In strongest bands Orontes and Arsetes. Oro. Even so, my friendâand policy demands That he who runs the mingled race of life, Should learn to veil himself, and oft appear The thing he is notâ Zop. Should propitious fortune Remove your rival henceâ Oro. If this report Be true, the dark eclipse that late has frown'd, No more, my friend, shall intercept my fame; The war's great field, at this auspicious time Begun, shall not enrich a stranger's hand, But fall the harvest of Orontes' sword.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Garden, with Palm-trees, Olives, and other Easter Plants. Enter Cleonice. Cleonice. Alas! it will not be! and fond remembrance In vain recalls the pastâwhere, where is now That reason's boast, which o'er creation lifts The pride of man, when fickle as the gale That sweeps the blossom from the bough, our passions Veer with each hour, and shake our best resolves? How is my bosom chang'd!âno longer now, From my example, mother's teach the young And tender maid, who dreads each swelling wave That heaves but gently o'er the stream of life, To rise superior to her sex's weakness!â Enter Arsinoe. Arsi. Friend of my life, whose partial choice has given Arsinoe long the privilege to pass The ceremonious bounds, which birth and title Had plac'd between us, wherefore art thou chang'd From her that lov'd, and lov'd but her Arsinoe? Cleo. Still art thou here the partner of my heart: Then wherefore this reproach? and why complain Of change that never yet this breast has known? We were two plants that grew in friendship's soil, And promis'd fruits of never-dying love. Arsi. Then every care that Cleonice knew Arsinoe too has shar'dâbut late I've mark'd That Cleonice, different from herself, Shuns even Arsinoe's presence, ever seeks The lone recess, and brooding o'er her thoughts, Nurses some hidden griefâsoon war again Shall loose its rageâperhaps the threatening danger Alarms your fear. Cleo. Thou know'st that I alone Remain'd the comfort of a father's age, When fate, that tore Polemon from the hope Of his Bithynia, from a husband's arms A hapless consort sever'd, thou remember'st, My mother, sad Arete, bow'd with grief, Soon mix'd her ashes with the son's she mourn'd: Then, left in early youth, my converse oft Sooth'd a fond parent's pangs, when recollection Rais'd up the form of blessings lost for ever! While, as I grew, paternal fondness saw With partial eye his Cleonice's mind Expand beyond her sex: hence not alone, The soft, the winning talents, that to life Give female polish, but the greater arts Ennobling man were taught my ripening age. But, o'er the rest, my sire, whose bosom glow'd T'avenge his son, enur'd my thoughts to cherish Deep hatred of the foe by whom he fell. Arsi. Hatred and vengeance ill agree, my friend, With tender grief like thineâestrang'd from all Thy wonted temper, solitude bespeaks Far other changeâThen seek not to deceive The searching eye of friendship. Cleo. Alas! Arsinoe, I feel the woman hereâthou said'st but now That war again must soon unloose its rage: Is there no cause for fear? whate'er the tongue Of stoic fortitude may boast, the mind, The generous mind that owns life's dearest ties, Will nourish feelings pride disdains to own. Arsi. Revolve our present state, our country's sword, Now us'd to victory, gives high expectance Of future triumphs, while for you, my friend, If love, if grandeur charm, Bithynia's throne Shall raise you high, and Hymen light his torch At Cupid's flameâIs not the first of men, The first of heroes, yours? Yes, Cleonice, Each anxious doubt shall fleet like morning mist, And all be lost in your Orontes' arms. Cleo. Orontes' arms!âO, Heaven! what have I said! By every tie of loveâBut whitherâwhither Now rove my thoughts! Leave, leave me, my Arsinoe, To brood in secret o'er my treasur'd sorrows. Arsi. Scarce from her tenth fair crescent has the moon Silver'd night's fleecy robe, since I've beheld, Though silent, I've beheld thy altered mien; Methinks e'er since the day, when 'midst the ranks The sword of violence, may now secure A nation's fame and vengeanceâYes, whate'er Arsetes' race or country, beauty's charms Insure his future service.âFair Arsinoe, Thy virtuous friend, shall bind her native land In grateful thanks for such a hero's valour. Our friend, our Teramenes, joins to his Arsinoe's hand, and gives, in such a son, A great ally in Lycomedes' cause. Led by Orontes' and Arsetes' valour, What may Bithynia's squadrons not atchieve? Cleo. [Aside.] Support me, Heaven! [To Ter.]âsir, I confess the virtues Of my Arsinoe, and her beauty's charms: Permit me yet to ask you, if Arsetes Has e'er reveal'dâPerhaps some distant fair, Whose love and beauty had possess'd his soul, Impels him to forsake Bithynia's court. Tera. No, princessâif this judgment, not unskill'd In human kind, can read the thoughts of men, He loves Arsinoe: late have I observ'd His bosom labouring with the stifled passion, Of recent birth; and well I know my daughter Owns, with a virgin blush, Arsetes' virtues: Nor could a youth, whose fortune only rests In his own merits and his sword, refuse That hand which Nicomedia's noblest peers With transport would receive. Lyc. Why droops my daughter? Still cherish hope; a train of better days Succeeds, where vengeance brightens up the prospect. My age's darling! 'tis for thee my soul Still labours, though declining years would fain Woo me to shades of peaceâto raise thee high, With thy Orontes, and avenge my boy, I scorn reposeânor will I rest till these Old eyes behold in chains or breathless stretch'd The cruel foe by whom Polemon fell! Come, Teramenes, let us seek Arsetes, Then once again renew our vows to pour The war's whole rage on Artabasus' head. [Exeunt Lyc. and Ter. Cleo. [Alone.] It is enoughâmisfortune now has spent. Her utmost shaftsâand I defy the future! O, Cleonice! has thy struggling bosom For this so long contended? Oft when pride Of inborn dignity, when sense of fame, And every duty to a father, urg'd My soul to combat loveâhow have the words Of perfidy ensnar'd my easy heart! Deceiv'dârejectedâwedded to Arsinoe! But hence!âavaunt!âI willâI would forget The perjur'd, yet the once belov'd Arsetes! But see!âthe traitor comes!âO, heaven! away With woman's weaknessâmeet him as befits a princess slighted and her love betray'd! Enter Arsetes. Arse. While thus the fairest of her sex withdraws Of rebel arms my father scap'd with life, Sav'd by the gallant aid of brave Arsetes.â Ha!âthou art paleâand now the mantling blood Returns once moreâWhat can this mean?âMy heart Has caught the alarm, and, Oh! my soul forebodes Distress and anguish to my hopeless love. [Aside. Cleo. It must be soâhence every vain respect! I can no more dissembleâHear, Arsinoe, Hear then, and pity Cleonice's weakness! While Lycomedes, with a monarch's care, Plans future schemes of greatnessâCleonice, Lost to herself, her rank, her sex's glory, Dotes on the merits of a youth unknown! Arsi. Orontes thenâ Cleo. Orontes!âname him notâ I own his worthâI own the sacred rights A king and father claimâbut I must own, Though while I speak, confusion fills my soul, Arsetes bears down all; and though the pride Of fortune rais'd me high above his hopes, A pleader here, which nothing could withstand, By looks, by deeds, by all that can ennoble The pride of youthful manhood, had prepar'd My easy bosom to receive the guest, That now, sole tyrant, reigns my bosom's lord! Arsi. Then am I lost indeed! [Aside. Cleo. Go, my Arsinoe, And learn if aught is rumour'd that pertains To my Arsetes:âsoon this favour'd hero Will leave Bithynia's courtâbut still remember Veil'd in thy faithful breast to keep my secret: To thee I trust my life, my fame, my all! [Exit Arsi. Cleo. [Alone.] Lost and bewilder'd still I rove in fate's Distressful labyrinthâWhy, Cleonice, Why didst thou leave the shore of calm indifference, To launch upon the dangerous sea of love? Enter Lycomedes, and Teramenes. Lycom. This day, my Cleonice, surely dawns With happiest omensâHe, whose valiant arm, Join'd with Orontes, quell'd our rebel sons; To whom the public voice gave every suffrage Of grateful tribute, threaten'd to forsake Our realm, and bear to other climes his sword. But Teramenes, who with counsel sage For ever watches o'er his country's weal, Has found the happy means to fix him here, To graft his virtues on Bithynia's stock, Blest earnest of revenge! Cleo. What means my father? [Aside. My lord the duty Cleonice owes Her country's welfare, and her father's honour, Demands my thanks for every aid that Heaven Gives to Bithynia's strengthâand sure, Arsetes Stands first in martial praiseâBut say, my father, What happy means has Teramenes found. To fix him yours? Lycom. Such means as oft have dealt Destruction on mankind: what oft has drawn That his Pharnaces, his expected son, Will join, ere yet they reach the bounds of Pontus, His native bands,âthere, kneeling at his feet, Implore forgivenessâin this interval Of fate and love, these lips shall once again Assail with every soothing eloquence: The cruel Cleonice; then, Agenor, To Artabasus will I open all My secret heartâperhaps some future day (O, busy hope!) may give me undisguis'd To plead my cause before her, when my sighs Shall in her breast revive the tender flame, And love with endless rapture crown Pharnaces! [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. A Gallery. Enter Lycomedes and Teramenes. Lyco. How stand the soldiers' hopes, my Teramenes? What spirit breathes among their ranks, to give A presage of the war! Tera. The troops on fire, Demand alone Orontes and Arsetes; With loud reproach they execrate the foe, And hail with joy the near expiring truce. Lyc. Yes, Teramenesâcivil discord now, That sheathes her sword, has left revenge to rear Her dreadful bannerâNemesis has heard Our solemn vows against exulting Pontus. No more Polemon's ghost shall haunt my dreams, Arsetes and Orontes shall extend My name to latest times; the glorious love Of empire and of arms, that fir'd my youth, Shall warm my frozen ageâtoo long compell'd I smother'd in my breast the flame of hatred; But when my soul forgets thy loss, Polemon, Disgrace and ruin o'er these silver locks Shed their black influence!âOrontes, welcome; What hear'st thou of the foe? Enter Orontes. Oro. Not unprepar'd The king of Pontus, from Heraclea's walls, Has drawn the choicest sons of valour forth, That lie encamp'd beside Parthenius' stream. Tera. 'T is said they wait the arrival of Pharnaces, (The kingdom's hope) whom Artabasus sent, What time Bithynia sign'd the truce with Pontus, To distant Rome to train his youth in arms, And Fame, with loudest tongue, proclaims his praise. Lyc. A stripling when he left his father's court? Tera. He was; and now scarce twenty suns have ripened Our fruitful years, since Artabasus gain'd By him a parent's name.â Lyc. Such as he isâ O, scorpion memory! such perhaps had been Bithynia's heir and Lycomedes' son! O, Teramenes! O, Orontes! pity To solitude and sadness, shuns the gaze Of admiration, let Arsetes yet Intrude on Cleonice's lonely hours, Ere cruel fate compelsâ Cleo. My lord, forbearâ This needed notâa hero's towering soul Soars high above the weakness of the lover: Since thou wilt part, it is not Cleonice Can here detain Arsetesâother charmsâ But I forget myselfâexcuse me, sirâ Whate'er your aimsâlet not my presence damp The glorious fortune love and fate prepareâ And think not e'er, awaken'd from her dream Of fond credulity, that Cleonice Will cloud your joys, or stop your path to greatness. [Exit. Arse. [Alone.] Where am I? sure I dreamâmy every sense Is lost in wild amazementâ Enter Agenor. Age. All is ready, And nothing now remains but that we quit Bithynia's court for Artabasus' campâ What mean those looks of sorrow, wherefore heaves Your swelling breast, while clouded with despair Your eyes, in silent pause, reproach the gods! Arse. Alas! what shall I sayâcould'st thou believe it, Agenor? she for whom my soul had near Forgot a kingdom's fame, a father's love, Each nice respect of honour, made my name To future times the scorn of every tongue, That fathers to their sons might point the example, And bid them fear to fall as fell Pharnaces! Even she, my friend, has now with cruel scorn, Repaid my loveâ Age. O, sir, forgive Agenor; But sure in pity fate concurs even here To hasten your resolvesâwhate'er the cause Of Cleonice's anger, every moment Is wing'd with perilâthink what foes conspire Against your father's peace, his life and fame. Arse. No more, no more, Agenorâbest of friends, In thee thy father Tiridates speaks. Pharnaces still thou shalt retrieve thy glory, Burst from the veil of dark obscurity And blaze in virtues beamâBut yet, Agenor! O, yet induge a heart that sinks beneath Accumulated anguishâcan I leave My Cleonice thusâalas! who knows How soon, by rash resentment urg'd, her hand May to Orontes yield her plighted faith! While absent hence Pharnaces.â Age. Wilt thou then linger here, unmindful still Of fame and Artabasus? Arse. Noâthis night, Be witness every power! we leave the courtâ This only day indulge a lover's fondness! The care be thine that Artabasus soon Receive this signet, with the welcome news A father's feelingsâThou, Orontes, saw'st My hapless boyâthy pious arms embrac'd My lost Polemon, as life's gushing stream Sprinkled his budding laurelsâwhere was then A father's vengeful sword, while to his tent You bore him pale and senseless, distant far, Detain'd by coward age, these ears receiv'd The dreadful tidings, when his frantic mother Ended her wretched beingâPowerful Jove! Shed from thy bitter urn the dregs of anguish On my poor span of life, withhold each comfort Which creeping years, o'erwhelm'd with sorrow, claim, If I forgive the cruel hand that cropt This blooming plant, which else had flourish'd now And shelter'd with his shade my wasting age! Oro. Soon shall we lead th'embattled squadrons forth On Artabasusâshould this boasted son Return, though conquest-plum'd, he comes perhaps A fated victimâ Lyc. O! that thought, Orontes, Gives vigour to my nerves!âYe powers of vengeance! Hear, hear a father's voice, and through his son, Reach Artabasus's heart, that after years Of tedious expectation, now at length Return'd and scarcely welcom'd, he may fall A dreadful sacrificeâthen through the sense, The thrilling sense of fond parental love, By his Pharnaces let him know the pangs Of Lycomedes, when Polemon fell! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A private Apartment.âEnter Cleonice and Arsinoe. Cleonice. Talk not of comfortâ't is in vain, Arsinoe; Arsetes leaves usâmy relentless scorn, Impell'd by frantic jealousy, the madness Of woman's love, drives from Bithynia's court The first of warriors: his right hand, that still Held Victory captive, now to happier realms Shall bear his fortune and his fameâthe sun That rises on the war shall see our troops Pale and dismay'd for their Arsetes lost. Who knows the event?âthe same declining sun May blush upon Bithynia's shame, and guild With favouring rays the tents of Artabasus, May smile upon his arms; while Lycomedes Curses each day that wider spreads his shame. Arsi. Alas! my friend, your warmth of temper frames The gloomiest prospects of imagin'd terrorâ Though fortune now may frownâ Cleo. Thee too, Arsinoe, Thee have I wrong'dâforgive thy Cleoniceâ Art thou to blame, if, fram'd for gentlest passions, Thy breast, the seat of innocence and love, Confest the manly beauties of Arsetes, Not bound by cruel ties of fame or duty? Rouze, rouze, my feeble virtueâyes, I feel New strength, and should Arsetes yet remainâ I think, ArsinoeâHeaven support the thought! I thinkâI could resolve to yield him to theeâ But see, thy fatherâ Enter Teramenes. Tera. All the hopes we form'd To keep Arsetes here, dissolve in air: Thus oft, presumptuous man too fondly grasps Ideal good: the hero, whom we deem'd Secur'd by every tie, declines the hand By Hymen given, endow'd with wealth and honours; While candour blushes on his modest cheek, He owns Arsinoe's virtues, owns the fate That now forbids him to receive her love, Or longer to remain Bithynia's guest. Cleo. Still art thou true, Arsetes! Tera. My Arsinoe, Why heaves thy bosom?âStill our guardian gods We trust will smile. Arsi. My lord, Arsinoe stands Prepar'd for allâbe witness, Heaven! how oft I check'd each flattering hope: forgive, my father, The involuntary sigh! perhaps the last The fruitless effort of expiring passion! Tera. Call up the thoughts that suit thy sex and rank: Time shall, with lenient hand, relieve thy anguish, Thy princess, with the gracious warmth of friendship Shall shed the balm of comfort in thy wounds: âStill art thou sad!âpermit me, Cleonice, Awhile retir'd, with dear paternal counsels, To arm her tender breast, that peace again May chase despair, and ease an anxious father. [Exit with Arsinoe. Cleo. [Alone.] Though my heart joys to find Arsetes true, Still am I wretchedâyet again methinks, Fain would I once again behold that face Where love, where faith!âbut O! 't is madness all! Doom'd to Orontes, when the lonely hour Invites to shades of sorrow, tyrant duty Makes even my grief a crimeâbut let me still, Let me once more, while yet without reproach I may indulge the sight, behold Arsetes, Take the last sad adieuâand like a wretch That shivers on the precipice of fate, Enjoy the parting glimpse of peace and happiness, Then sink at once to misery and Orontes. [Exit. SCENE II. A Hall.âEnter Lycomedes, Teramenes, and Orontes. Lyc. The gods have heard our vows, my Teramenes, Ere yet the night ascends, to Pontus' camp Pharnaces will return; even now we heard From certain tidings, that the prince's signet Receiv'd by Artabasus, had confirm'd His near approachâ Tera. My liege, the enemy Will feel new vigour from the expected sight Of young Pharnacesâere a few short days Are past, th'advancing troops by Arcas led Will join our arms; united then, our bands May rush to certain conquest. Oro. Teramenes, Forgive me, if my soul revolts from counsels Which frigid prudence dictatesâshall we then Remain inglorious, skulk within our walls, To wait uncertain aidâpermit the foe To gather strength and courage from the presence Of this Pharnaces?âO! forbid it, virtue! That virtue which has fired Bithynia's sons To glorious conquest and extended sway! Lyc. My empire's hope! on whose succeeding reign Sits expectation: this Pharnaces still Turns every scale of fight; his towering spirit, Enthusiast of the battle, looks with scorn On vulgar honours.â Oro. To this boasted hero, Deck'd in his foreign triumphs, send the trump Of stern defiance, that Pharnaces' arm May meet with mine before the camp, and give A glorious opening to the morn of war! Lyc. â'T is nobly utter'dâthy impatient sword May find employmentâto the hostile camp A herald shall to-morrow bear our challenge To this Pharnaces, in the listed field Next day to engage in single fight, the champion Bithynia's king shall sendâbut since the life Of my Orontes on the great event Suspended hangsâto thine six warriors more Shall join their dauntless names. Oro. Let instant lots Decide the combatant; or rather fix, Without the chance of lots, Orontes' sword, Which here he tenders, vowing from Pharnaces To tear his recent spoils, and to the manes Of your Polemon, shed his life, or fall Himself a victim, happy in the applause Of his lov'd sovereign, and his country's tears. Enter Arsetes. Arse. Permit me, sir, since time, with rapid wing Now mocks my stay, to waken your remembrance, That call'd by fate to other ties which honour, Which duty must enforce, Arsetes now Prepares to leave the court, reluctant leave That court, where Lycomedes' royal hand Sheds lavish honours on his poor desert. Lyc. Yet ere thou goest, thy valour that has long Sustain'd our arms, may add one labour more; For still methinks, Arsetes, would my soul Detain thee here; but fate, I know not why, In thee from Lycomedes tears a hero, Whom next Orontes he esteem'd his son; This very now, ere thy arrival here, A challenge was decreed to dare Pharnaces To single fightâOrontes, 'midst the list Of noble candidates for fame, demands The glorious peril, let us add to these Arsetes' name, and instant lots decide The champion fated on his venterous sword To bear Bithynia's vengeanceâ Arse. [Aside.] Ha! what means My wayward destiny! Oro. Behold the champion Thy choice selectsâsee, Lycomedes, see, Suspense is on his browâIs this the man Whose arms so oftâ Arse. Yes, 't is the man, Orontes! Who fought Bithynia's battles, he whose forceâ But I am calmâNo, Lycomedes, think not I shrink from honour's trialâshould the lot Bring forth Arsetes' nameâbelieve me, sir, Whate'er PharnacesâI alone perhaps Am doom'd his victor, when the world shall own That what Pharnaces was, is then Arsetes. Lyc. Enough, enough;âthy zeal, Orontes, here Prompts thee too far; nor thou, Arsetes, heed Orontes' eager warmthâto dare beyond The level of mankind, and bravely reach At virtue's height, is all that human firmness Can boast her ownâSuccess, enthron'd above, Beyond a mortal's power, by Heaven alone Commissioned, crowns the deedânow let us henceâ The lots once drawn, soon as the fated morn Ascends the steep to gild the turret's height, Our knight shall wait the signal.

Enter Cleonice. She comesâonce more 't is given me to address My Cleoniceâ'midst surrounding perils Yet happy, if I once again can pour My soul's full anguish hereâ Cleo. Alas! Arsetes, What shall I say, how speak my bosom's tumult! I fear too much I wrong'd thee; though our fate Can ne'er unite us, yet I feel my heart Will never cast Arsetes from the throne Where Love hath placed him.â Arse. O! thou most unkind! What had I done to merit!âwhen my soul With anguish bledâ Cleo. Alas! I thought thee false, And though I knew thou never could'st be mine, I could not bear another should receive That love, which once I deem'd was mine alone. Arse. Another, Cleonice! is there then Amidst the blooming circle of your sex A maid whose charmsâwhat treacherous tongue has dar'd Traduce my faith?â Cleo. The king and Teramenes Declar'd your purpose to espouse Arsinoe; Fir'd at the thought, my rash ungovern'd temperâ Thou know'st the rest.â Arse. Forbear, I know too much: For this, thou could'st unheard condemn the man That lives not but in thee; bid the same breath That warm'd my love to rapture, like a frost, Nip every blossom of my future hopes!â Thou never lov'dstâ Cleo. Then wherefore am I wretched? Unjust Arsetes! give me back, ye powers, That blest indifference, when us yet this pulse Had never learnt to beat, these nerves to tremble With fear, suspense, with all the nameless train That banish peace for everâIn Orontes I viewed a prince, to whom paternal care Had pledg'd my nuptials; till a stranger's virtues Drove every thought from Cleonice's breast Of interest or ambitionâstill remember I willâI would retain the inbred dignity That suits the daughter of Bithynia's king.â Enough, Arsetes, that my soul has stoop'd To own her weaknessâyet since cruel Fate Forbids our union, when thy heart selects Another love, may every happiness That crowns the fondest pairâ Arse. O! never, never! This bosom traitor to its firstâ Cleo. The kingâ Enter Lycomedes. Lyco. Well dost thou honour here the man whose sword May turn the tide of victoryâmy daughter, Behold Arsetes, now decreed to meet In combat with Pharnacesâknow, the lots Of fate are drawn; our fame is in thy hands; Thou art our champion. Arse. Since the will of destiny Seals me thy warrior; till the morn dissolves The truce with Pontus, let me from the court Awhile retire, on something that concerns My weal, my honourâwhen the blush of dawn Shall strike the altar on the forest's edge To Mars devoted, there thy guard shall find A champion arm'd to meet Bithynia's foe, If Artabasus' son accept the war. Lyco. Till then the hours be all thy ownâNor claims Bithynia, or Bithynia's king, from thee But what befits thy honourâshould success Attend our hero's arms, these walls shall ring With joyful pÃ¦ans, and to crown the day With jubilee, the day that sets us free From such a foe, Orontes to the altar Shall lead his Cleonice; and the garlands Of Hymen's triumphs mingle with the palms Which victory displaysâThe important hour Demands my counsel henceâtill next we meet, Farewellâand should Pharnaces, sway'd by virtue, Accept our challengeâmay Polemon's death Sit on thy lanceâa mother's grief and death Edge thy keen faulchion, and a father's sufferings Infuse new spirit in the day of fight, That every eye may view with tears of transport Arsetes' laurels and Bithynia's glory! [Exit. Cleo. [Pauses.] Yet is there more! O, no! my fate has long Frown'd in the distant prospectânow the vision Draws near, and misery with rapid speed Rides on the advancing hourâthy life, Arsetes, Expos'd to peril in to-morrow's field, Excites each fearâfor thee my prayers shall pierce Jove's awful throne; yet must thy victory Doom me a wretch for everâled to grace Thy triumph in Orontes' hated bands! Yet be it soâfate, honour, virtue, all Demand this sacrifice!âand should the event Of battle crown thee with the victor's wreath, And still Bithynia's vows detain thee here, Arsinoe be thy bright, thy dear rewardâ She loves thee, my ArsetesâyesâO, Heaven! Why do I weepâlet her bestow that happiness Which Cleonice neverâ Arse. Still thou know'st not What fate has yet reserv'dâthe ensuing combat May clear a mystery, which till now compell'd My bleeding heart had kept from allâfrom thee! Then by each past, now hopeless hour of love, Still cherish in thy breast the gentle flame Arsetes kindled, till the expected sun Sets on the battle's fate; our fate perhaps Hangs on the equal balanceâCleonice Will ne'er refuse these moments to Arsetes: Thou know'st not what I feel for thee, my soul Labours beneath a load of secret anguish: While danger, ambush'd in a thousand forms, Waits every step, and threats my way with ruin. Cleo. Thou hast prevail'd, Arsetes; and whate'er The fateful birth that waits to be disclosed, My love shall hope the eventâ Arse. The day declines, And warns me henceâ Cleo. O, Heaven! we meet no more Till that eventful time! yet go, Arsetes; Go whither glory callsâHear, every power! Raise o'er his head the buckler of defence, Pluck from the hostile hand the nerve of strength, And bring him victor homeânor let a tear From Cleonice stain the hour that gives Bithynia safety, and Arsetes fame! [Exit. Arse. [Alone.] Methinks my pulse more quickly beats, and all My spirits rouse, as nearer to the goal Verges my fate. Enter Agenor. Arse. Agenor! Age. O, my friend! Reflect what perils hover round; some God (Forgive me, prince!) that frowns upon our rashness, Has form'd the labyrinth that threatens nowâ This combat by the king propos'dâ Arse. O, wherefore Did not Orontes mark the champion's lot, Then Fate, perhapsâBut yet my friend, this fight, This mystic fight, may work some means to unravel The knot of destinyâThe hour now presses; The herald soon will seek my father's camp. Age. Then let us hence!âThe war-like troops of Pontus Impatient wait to see their prince return; Whose glories won in distant climes, attract Each listening ear, while every soldier, warm With expectation, pants to view that face Where Mars propitious in life's opening prime, With youthful graces blends the victor's smileâ Your father tooâ Arse. I feel, I feel it here! The godlike, virtuous ardor! yes, Agenor, My soul is up in armsâmethinks I see Good Artabasus darting through the ranks His ardent looksâmethinks I hear him chide, With fond paternal warmth, his tardy son. Now, on his reverend cheek, where age begins. To shed its silver honours, stands the tear Of tenderness, while all the parent longs To see those features ripening into manhood, Which last he viewed in early bloomâI hear The shout of charging hosts! the neigh of steeds! The battle joins, and no Pharnaces there! Now danger stalks around, and Artabasusâ Distracting thought! fly, fly, my best Agenor, Fly to redeem our fame, and save a father! [Exeunt. SCENE III. Another Apartment. Enter Orontes and Zopyrus. Zop. Compose yourself, my lord. Oro. Zopyrus, neverâ Was it for this I deem'd his absence near, And now behold him with Orontes join'd In glory's listânay more, by partial fortune Declar'd Bithynia's champion! Should he fall, He leaves a name in arms to cope with mine!â But should he conquer! Hell is in that thought? Who knows, Zopyrus!âwhither may the king's Too partial views incline?âThe kingdom freed From such a foeâPolemon's death reveng'dâ He may, perhaps, forgetâThe crown, Zopyrus, That mistress of my soul, to which ambition Points every aim, may grace a stranger's brow! Zop. What says Orontes? Oro. This right arm might reach His lifeâbut policy forbids my hatred To blaze abroadâThe many blindly dote On him they scarcely knowâZopyrus, speak, Art thou my friend? Zop. Holdâlet me thinkâOrontes Bears not the coward's scruplesâthere is yet Perhaps a wayâ Oro. Pause not, but speakâ Zop. 'Tis hereâ Arsetes must not liveâGive but the word, He dies, and dies ere he can meet Pharnaces! Oro. But how? Zop. Thou know'st that I command the guard To escort Arsetes from the fane of Mars To meet Pharnaces; from a desperate band, The power of gold, and vast reward, shall single A chosen few, that at a signal given Shall rid your soul of every fear in him: And more, to blind suspicion's eye, their arms, Their vests shall seem of Pontus' troops: the deed Effected once, the ensuing fight shall see These tools of our great enterprize expos'd Full in the front of slaughter, that in heat Of onset they may fall, and in their fall Mock all discovery. Oro. Come to my breast! By Heaven it ripens wellâThen, when he's dead, We lead the troops to well-feign'd vengeance!âSay, Where lies the force of Pontus? Zop. Station'd near Bithynia's bounds, that thrice an arrow's flight May reach their outmost guard. Oro. Now, hated rival! Now triumph for a momentâMy revenge Prepares such greeting, never more thy deeds Shall shine to vulgar eyesâon proud Arsetes Death soon shall close his everlasting gate, While life to me displays the glorious path That leads the daring mind to fame and empire.

This hour, methinks the hand of Heaven once more On destiny's eternal page begins To enrol Bithynia's honoursâSpeak, my son! Thy generous soul, now wrapt with glory, pants To share Arsetes' danger. Oro. Lycomedes, I own my spirit rouzes at the call Of martial conflict; yet, forbid it, Heaven! My heart, impell'd by envy, should repine To view another's honoursâby the hand Of Mars, the patron of my wars, I swear There's not a breast would feel Orontes' joy To hear the fate my ardent hope divines This morn awaits the glories of Arsetes. Lyc. O, truly great!ânor think thy noble sword Shall useless sleep; noâshould the great event Thy soul forebodes, attend Arsetes' valour, Thyself with Teramenes join'd, shall pour Our eager thousands on the troops dismay'd Of Pontus: Arcas shall arrive to join Our glorious arms; and universal victory Clap her glad wingsâthen every happy wreath, That hope had form'd, shall deck these hoary temples, And choral virgins hymn Bithynia's bands Return'd in triumph home! Our Teramenes, Already now, in pomp of martial pride, Leaves these glad walls, and swells with war's deep notes The soldier's ardor, while the plaited mail Heaves on each bosomâ Enter Cleonice, attended. O, my Cleonice! Age now, with backward gaze, on memory's plain Revives forgotten honoursâSay, my child; Owns not thy heart a more than woman's feelings On this eventful moment! Cleo. Yes, my soul Expands to greater hopesâeach other thought Now sleeps neglectedâwhile the mightier claims Of filial duty and my country's love Possess me wholeâthe noble mind that draws Its boasted lineage from a race of kings; Of kings, the sacred delegates of Heaven; Should banish every selfish view that tends not To wide diffusive goodâOh! should the hand Of prosperous fortune mark this happy day, What thousands then will hail with rapture's voice Arsetes' blest return!âfor this event Old age shall lift his wrinkled palms in praise; The virgin's tears shall vanish into smiles; Redoubled warmth shall nerve the soldier's arm; Till conquest swell the breath of fame to spread Bithynia's deeds, and lift her name to Heaven!

Arsetes'!âlook, my father, The low-hung trophy and the dusty arms.â Enter in procession a troop of Soldiers, to a dead march, advancing slowly from the further end of the stage: first a company trailing their lances and trophies in the dust, then the helmet, shield, and lance of Arsetes, borne by two Soldiers; next Teramenes, and last a bier with a dead body, covered with a mantle, the Soldiers bearing branches of cypress and palm: the procession advancing towards the front of the stage, halts, and the music ceases. Cleo. [Advancing towards the Trophies.] Ha! sure I know that crest! That buckler's orb Blaz'd with Arsetes' honours!â Lyc. Teramenes, Whence is this dreadful pomp of death? Tera. I cannotâ I cannot speak!âO, royal sir, behold Bithynia's champion! broken is the lance Of war, the genius of the battle faints! Arsetes is no more!âlo! there he lies Pale from the hand of fate, no more to wake To fame, to virtue, or Bithynia's cause. [Cleonice faints. Lyc. My daughter!âHeaven! why am I thus unmov'd!

Thou know'st, Arsetes Directed, that Zopyrus might attend Two hours from dawning day at Mars's altar: But ere th'appointed time, a band of ruffians Attack'd the hapless youth; in vain his valour Oppos'd their fury; cover'd o'er with wounds, Senseless he fell; but when Zopyrus came And ask'd, with tears, the assassin's name, his eyes Then nearly clos'd, he rais'd, and murmur'd forth Pharnaces' name, and died! Oro. [Aside.] Be firm, my soul, And hide thy secret triumph! Lyc. 'T is enough! Pharnaces!âArtabasus!âGods, I thank you! Cleo. I weep not nowâmy heart would fain assume The cruel firmness of unfeeling woe! Arsetes murder'd! murder'd by Pharnaces! Where, where was justice, where the guardian powers That watch o'er virtue!âYet, it will not beâ My resolution melts, and Nature pays This streaming anguish to Arsetes' memory! Lyc. My child, my Cleonice, in thy sorrows A king and father shareâfor prayers and tears Are all an old man's weapons: hoary age, That breaks the vigour of Alcides, leaves These idle sinews useless as the arms Of female weakness!

No, my father, I canâI will support itâ[approaching the body]âIs this Arsetes!

Zopyrusâall our schemes abortive thus! What he, whom lifeless now the city mourns, Is not ArsetesâArsetes and Pharnaces The sameâ Zop. There is no room for doubtâthe tablets Found on the vestments of the slain unknown, Confirm the important truth. Oron. Unthinking wretch! A thousand proofs recur, that speak too plainâ His birth conceal'dâsurprise when Lycomedes Propos'd the combat with the princeâdistraction! A turn like this may frustrate all!âit teems With tenfold ruin!âCleonice's love To this Arsetes starts another train Of galling doubtsâWhat's to be done? Zop. Already The soldier pants impatient on the edge Of battleâWho can tell the event? Pharnaces May fall, and crown your wish. Oron. But still the chance Of war is ever doubtfulâCould we draw Pharnaces from the tumult of the fight, The tufted grove, that shades the fane of Mars, Might hide an ambush'd force, to whelm at once Our foe in swift destruction. Zop. 'Tis a thought The cause itself inspires. Oron. Zopyrus, go; Inflame the soldiers with Arsetes' name, That name shall second our designâI haste To lead them to the fieldâawayâ [Exit Zopyrus. Oron. [Alone.] Ascend, Black mischief, child of hell, from the dire gloom Of burning Acheron, whence perfidy, Assassination, treason (names that shake The coward soul), breathe forth inspiring aid To vast ambition, at whose dazzling shrine Orontes ever bendsâI fell, I feel The sacred influence hereâIf fortune yet Assist my arms, in fight Pharnaces falls An open victim; but if still averse She thwart my glorious aims, what force denies, Deep covert guile shall give; and all my fears Be hush'd for ever in Pharnaces' blood. [Exit. SCENE III. The Camp of Artabasus and Pharnaces. Art. Yes, my Pharnaces, my full bosom heaves With all a father's feelingsâevery god That knows the transport here, receive my vows Of gratitude and praise: thy blest return Each year shall chronicle; on that glad day The hallowed fanes shall grateful incense breathe To those high powers, whose providential care Reliev'd my anxious fearsâPharnaces lives! In safety lives, clasp'd in these arms of fondness; Yet I could chideâfor O! reflect, my son, How I have suffer'd in thy painful absence, Could'st thou so far forgetâ Phar. O, royal sir! Believe me, while I swear, that oft the son Reproach'd the lover; oft I sympathiz'd With Artabasus. Arta. Though to partial nature The warmer sallies of ungovern'd youth, Ere long experience turns the page of life, Are venial errors, yet thy rashness here Startles beliefâWhat perils hast thou 'scap'd! What deathful snares! perhaps, a fate like his, Whom all Bithynia for Arsetes mourns. Thou saidst it was Araxesâ Phar. 'T was Araxes, Whose mien and near resemblance to your son Assisted my designâWhen at my suit You gave consent to accept Arsetes' challenge, I trusted to Araxes' breast my secret, Disguis'd him in the vest and arms I wore, When 'midst Bithynia's squadrons, with design Himself should for Arsetes' wage the combat, Instructed first to yield himself my prisoner: From hence I hop'd to plan some happy means Of peace, by conference open'd with the foe. But this distressful fate, mysterious heaven Has cast on poor Araxes, baffles all; And leaves me lost, uncertain whither points This deed, or what inhuman breast design'd it. Arta. Swear, my Pharnaces, never more to tempt Our hostile gods in Lycomedes' court, Nor give that life to hazard, which thy father Would ransom with his own. Phar. [kneels.] By this rever'd, This awful hand, Pharnaces vows to sacrifice His all to filial duty, every act Of his succeeding life shall speak the son: And, O! if fate requires! even love itself Shall bleed a victim at the shrine. Arta. Think not That Artabasus will condemn the love That honour sanctifiesâfor Cleonice, If ever rumour's tongue can claim belief, She merits all you feelâNay, more, my soul Could witness Lycomedes' regal virtues, Did not ambition, that excess of kings, That thirst of widen'd empire, that too far Inspir'd his early reign, now, even in age Impel him to unsheath invasion's sword. The king, who, urg'd by partial glory, breaks The sacred ties that link a social world, Should boast no more the image of those gods, Whose wide benevolence extends o'er all! Phar. Still, still my hopes, with fond presumption, form'd Ideal scenes of happinessâCould peace, With outstretch'd arms, embrace the warring nations, Could Lycomedes learn one self-same spirit, Inform'd his foe Pharnaces, and his once Belov'd ArsetesâYet I dare, my father, Boast a soft advocate in Cleonice. Arta. O, my Pharnaces, what can filial duty With him that loves, and loves like Artabasus! Ere day can yield to night, a trusty herald Shall to Bithynia's king, try every art Of eloquence, to bend his soul to terms That fit the king and fatherâGrant it, Heaven! The day that sees my lov'd Pharnaces happy, Gives Artabasus allâThen close, ye powers, Life's anxious scenes, and let me sleep in peaceâ Whence is that noise? [Alarm and shout. Enter Agenor, his Sword drawn. Age. To arms, my liege, the foe, Led by Orontes, issuing from the town, Advances on our campâ Phar. Orontes!âHeaven Has heard Pharnaces' prayerâMy lord, my father, My soul's on fire, and pants to meet in field My hated rival! Arta. Go, Agenor; bear Our instant orders to the troops, to range Their serried filesâPharnaces leads them on To fightâto victoryâ Phar. Hear, God of arms! Whose smiles have grac'd my earliest youthâO hear This last requestâStill in Pharnaces breathe The spirit of the war! Arta. Thy ardor wakes My youth againâHear now, a father's voice; With thy strong genius, lead him through the maze Of dangerous battle, that these eyes may trace His fearless steps, behold his brandish'd sword Shine forth the guardian of a nation's honour; And, while his arm asserts his county's cause, Assert the common rights of all mankind.

O, hear me stillâyet let these filial tears Prevail.âDeath is the last, the sure resource, And when fate closes every path that leads To future hopeâthis arm can then, my father, Fix one great period to a life of woes. Tera. My sovereign, Artabasus and Barzanes Are near at hand, from hence we may discern Their bucklers blaze [looking out]; away, my liege! Lyc. O! never!â They shall be metâthese wither'd limbsâlook there, See those sad monumentsâ [Points to the Urns. And shall the hands, The murderous hands by which they fell, here grasp The sword in triumph?âNo, these trembling feet Shall meet their fury. [Going. Cleo. YetâO, yet, my father! One moment hearâ Tera. Forgive me, royal sir! If thus compell'dâLearchus, helpâ Lyc. [Struggling.] Unhand meâ 'T is more than treasonâhence!â [Drops his sword in the struggle. Cleo. Lo! there, my father, Some god descends, and from your nerveless arm Strikes your resisting weapon. Lyc. O, shame! shame! 'T is sure the work of heaven!âthen all is past! I yieldâLead, lead me where thou wilt! [Shout. Tera. Again! Conduct them safely through the secret gate, Meantime myself, with some few friends will seek Orontes, and secure my king's retreat. [Exit. Cleo. O! hear me, Heaven! for Lycomedes hear! Still save him, sinking in this gulph of ruin! Or let one moment whelm us both in death, And end a father's and a daughter's woes! [Exeunt. SCENE II. An open Place in the City. Enter Artabasus, Barzanes, and Soldiers. Arta. Thus far, Barzanes, has the victor wreath Crown'd virtue with successâour arms, by heaven Impell'd to guard the sacred rights of men, Have to their deep recess pursu'd the foe. The city now is oursâthe hostile bands Submissive, or dispers'd, contend no longer; Then sheath the sword of death, and bid resentment To mercy yield her reignâthe noble mind, Though justice draw the sword, regrets that triumph Humanity must mourn: for Lycomedes, Give heedful orders, that whate'er shall chance, To make him prisoner, to our better fortune, They treat him with such honours as befit His name and rank, a captive of the war. Enter Officer. Offi. My liege, this instant Lycomedes, taken, With Cleonice, as they sought to gain The western tower, conducted by the guard, Attend your sovereign will. [Exit. Enter Lycomedes, Cleonice in chains, Guards. Lyc. [Entering.] Lead me to him, Whom Lycomedes' evil star has rais'd On fallen Bithynia's ruinâCleonice Associate in thy father's woesâAre these The hands that once I fondly press'd in mine, When on my knee thy pratling infancy Held me in all a parent's dear suspence? Are these lov'd hands now clasp'd in rugged steel And slavish manacles? Cleo. These hands, my father, Exulten chains that give to Cleonice, A glorious share in Lycomedes' sufferings. Nor are they bonds, since still these filial arms Embrace my fatherâO! believe me, sir, To suffer thus with you is height of bliss, Compar'd to freedom banish'd from your presence. Arta. If thou art heâO, Lycomedes!âhear No more thy foe, but brotherâwould to heaven Thy age would now repose in peace! those hairs Demand respect and honourâlet me then Exchange these slavish ties, for other ties Of amity and love. [Makes a sign to the Guard who takes off his chains. For thee, fair princess, What shall I say?âthese arms prophan'd, demand More than a king's atonement. [Takes off her chains. Is there ought Beside the gift of freedom? Cleo. Artabasus, There needs no moreâfrom him that slew my brother All gifts are equalâthough to the woman's weakness I yield these tears, my firmer soul disdains The tribute nature pays;âthen once again Restore those shacklesâgive me, to the depth Of dungeon gloomâthere's nor a hostile pang That enmity inflicts, but Cleonice Shall meet it all!âMy father tooâO, Heaven! Hence female softnessâyes, behold that weak Depress'd old age, behold this bloom of youth Nurs'd in the pomp of courtsâyet, Artabasus, This pair, unshaken, dares your worst of pains. Lyc. Hear every god my vows renew'dâhear too Polemon's shade! whene'er this hand shall join In friendly league with Pontus, haunt each hour Of ebbing life with horror's direst forms! Arta. Yet hear me, Lycomedes, still reflect, Thyself a warrior once, in fight he fell, Fell as a hero ought.âIn arms of old When demi-gods have fought, the fields have oft Borne slaughter'd chiefs, whose parents from the sky View'd their pale sons, and yielded to their fate. Lyc. Hear, hear, ye fathers; hear how cool the victor Can palliate death, and sooth a parent's loss. Polemon fell in fightâyes, Artabasus, Nobly indeed he fellâtoo daring youth! Whose unfledg'd open valour met the arm Of veteran crueltyâbut hear, proud man, Do all thy enemies so fairly perish?â How died Arsetes! hapless youthâthe last, The glorious work of Artabasus' race! Midst all my sufferings, still I joy to know Polemon died a heroâHad the hand Of time drawn out his early age to years Of ripe experience, he, like poor Arsetes, Had fall'n the murderer's victim. Arta. Little, sure, Thou know'st the work of fate,âthe youth who fell Was by Pharnacesâ Cleo. By Pharnaces!âyes, I know it wellâIs this the glorious hero, The boasted pupil in the school of Mars? Did he for this in Rome's immortal ranks Learn the brave trade of arms, to edge the sword Of base assassination, that the wiles Of black conspiracy might catch that life, Which ne'er had sunk in equal field of combat! Yesâmy Arsetesâto Pharnaces' cruelty Thou fall'st a victimâfall'st by him, whose arm Had else perhaps confess'd thy valour's force. Then had those limbs, my father, never felt The weight of chainsâyet should Orontes live, His valorous armâperhaps Pharnaces' life Atones for poor Arsetesâ Arta. Every power Forbid the implication! Lycomedes, Could I as well appease each vengeful thought For lost Polemon, as I now can clear The virtue of my son, by lying fame Traduc'dâ Cleo. Did not his lips all pale in death Proclaim Pharnaces guilty? Arta. There indeed, Mysterious darkness lurksâbut, Lycomedes, Speakâshould the hero whose triumphant arm Espous'd Bithynia's causeâshould he yet liveâ Cleo. Yet live! what means this cruel sport with woe? Arta. Hear then, and wondering hearâArsetes lives, Arsetes and Pharnaces are the same. Lyc. The same!âspeak, Artabasusâ Enter Officer. Off. Haste, my sovereign! Haste to the grove of palms,âthe prince assail'd By numbers, with Orontes at their head, A hundred lances glitter at his breast, And all their cry is vengeance and Arsetes. Arta. What do I hear! now, cruel Lycomedes, Now, Cleonice, glut your rage,âyet know Arsetes lives, and lives in my Pharnaces, Or this dread moment seals perhaps his doom, And ends a wretched parent!â [Ex. Art. and Bar. Cleo. Does he live, Live in Pharnaces! O, mysterious Heaven! Should it be thus, how has my ruthless hatred Pursued the man whom most I lov'dâthe man (Madness is in the thought) who now may breathe His last.â Lyc. Forbid it, virtue!âGods! I feel A secret impulse hereâit must not beâ For me he oft has triumph'dâspite of age And impotence of strength, yet will I face This last, this fatal sceneâmy Cleonice, Thy courage will pursue thy father's steps; Come, let us prove the worst of fortune's malice, Then close our eyes in peace, and rest for ever! [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Grove of palm trees, with the Temple of Mars discovered at a distance. [Clashing of swords.] Enter Orontes retreating before Pharnaces; a Party of Orontes driven off by the Soldiers of Pharnaces. Phar. Enough, my friends, enoughâthis life demands My sword aloneâfor thee, whose murderous guile With seeming manhood, drew me from the fight To fall by numbers, from this arm receive Thy treason's due reward. Oro. Fortune at length Deceives my aim;âbut be it soâI scorn To depecate thy vengeanceâwell thou know'st Orontes nowâZopyrus has confess'd, Pale, trembling dastard! sinking by thy arm, Our first device against the feign'd Arsetesâ This last is mineâthough interest and ambition Forbid me now to risk an equal combat, Yet since thy hated genius still prevails,â Hence every vain disguiseâas man to man, I dare thy worst. Phar. Behold, thou double traitor! The grove and temple where Araxes fell: Where now thy followers lurk'd in fatal ambush To ensnare Pharnacesâtremble now, while justice Here lifts the sword on this devoted spot, Here claims a sacrifice to every virtue, Faith, friendship, loyalty, and poor Araxes! [Fight. Arta. [Within.] Defend, defend my son! Oron. falls. Phar. There sink for ever, Nor leave thy equal here to curse mankind! Enter Artabasus and Agenor. Arta. Art thou then safe?âmy son! my son! Phar. My father! Enter Lycomedes, Cleonice, and Teramenes. Cleo. [Entering.] Death has been busyâsure the battle's tumult Rag'd here but nowâ Phar. [Turning.] 'T is Cleonice's voice! Lyc. He lives indeed! 't is he!âthe guardian genius That watch'd Bithynia's safetyâ Cleo. Heavenly Powers! And yet it cannotâspeak,âO speak, my father, Ere this lov'd phantomâ Phar. Still Arsetes lives; Behold him here;â[Kneels]âNo more unknown, who now Assert the lineal honours that await A kingdom's heir and Artabasus' son. Cleo. Pharnaces rise,âsure 't is allusion all! What then was he, whose pale and lifeless corseâ Arta. The youth, whom late you mourn'd for slain Arsetes, Was in his stead deputed for the fight. Phar. Orontes and Zopyrus have confess'd The snare in which this hapless victim fell; Orontes drew me now, by fraudful ambush, To perish hereâbehold where lies the traitor; His guilty life fast ebbing with his blood. Lyc. Orontes!âwhere! then where is virtue, gods! Now only living with Bithynia's foes! Why, Artabasus, did Polemon fall! Or fall by thee!â Oro. [Raising himself.] Hear, most unhappy father; Thou seek'st t'avenge Polemon's death,âbehold Him now reveng'dâlo! here his murderer lies! Arta. The youth that fell by me! Oro. By thee he fell, But fell unwoundedâto his tent convey'd Senseless awhile, he layâmyself alone Watch'd his returning lifeâat that fell moment, Ambition, powerful fiend! held forth to view Bithynia's crownâmy sacrilegious hand Uplifted then, with murderous weapon struck My prince's life. Lyc. What do I hear!âmy blood Is chill'd!âpernicious villain!âtake the vengeance A father's furyâ [Draws, is held by Arta. and Tera. Cleo. Gracious Heaven!âmy brother!â Tera. Yet holdâthough great your woesâthe guilty wretch Already gasps in death, and shivering stands On that dread brink, where vast eternity Unfolds her infinite abyss.â Lyc. Polemon! My murder'd boy! Oro. O thou bright sun! whose beams Now set in blood, dost thou not haste to veil Thy head in night, while Nature, through her works Shrinks from a wretch like me!âCome, deepest darkness, Hide, hide me from myself!âhence, bleeding phantom, Why dost thou haunt me still!âanother!âhence! They drive me to the precipiceâI sinkâ âO, Lycomedes!â [Dies. Lyc. Lo! where lies the serpent That late I nourish'd in my breast, to sting My unsuspecting heartâ Arta. A father's nature Feels for thy dreadful trialâLycomedes, Receive this pledge of friendshipâstill be thine Bithynia's crown, nor claim I aught from conquest But mutual peaceâsome other time shall tell This work of fateâBut who shall search the ways Of Heaven inscrutable, or dare to question Why the same power beheld Polemon fall, And sav'd Pharnaces for a father's love? 'T is ours with humble praise to take from Jove The cordial draught of joy, not murmur when He deals the cup of woe. Lyc. O, Artabasus! No longer now my foeâthis honour'd hand, This hand now free from my Polemon's death, Confirm the brother's unionâbalmy peace Rest with his manes, and remembrance ever With odorous praise surround his laurell'd tomb! But yet I have a sonâin thee he lives, Lives in Pharnacesâ[Embrace.]âYes, my more than brother, Our friendship knit shall plant the welcome olives Through both our lands, and bless their sons with peace! Phar. It must, it mustâsome genius whispers now Oblivion to my cares, and bright-wing'd Hope, Like Cleonice, points my soul to bliss! Lyc. If bliss be Cleonice, she is your's Once more, my sonâ Arta. My daughterâevery God Propitious smile to crown your virtuous love! Phar. Speak, Cleonice! does thy heart refuse To own the mighty rapture? Cleo. O, Pharnaces! Think how my bosom throbs with various tumult Of mingled joy and griefâMy brother's fate Still labours here, 'spite of the bliss that fills My conscious heart; for bliss it is to avow My boundless passionâwife of my Pharnaces, Or rather that dear name which first subdu'd My virgin heartâmy ever lov'd Arsetes! Lyc. To thee, my son Pharnaces, I resign Bithynia's crown, while I, retir'd in ease, Steal gently down the peaceful vale of life. Arta. Behold the latent treason brought to light! Though hid from mortal eye, the Eternal Mind Pervades the deepest gloomâConfess, my brother, The dazzling meteor that misled thy youth, And even seduc'd thy age: the monarch fir'd With false ambition for a conqueror's name, Is but the lash of Jove to scourge mankind. For thee, my son, by Lycomedes rais'd To guide, with early hand, the reins of empire, Remember what the duty of a king Exacts, while each domestic bliss shall crown Thy private hours, to watch thy people's weal, And share, like Heaven, thy happiness with all.

      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. Bulkely. Our author, all submission, sends me here, To make excuses for your simple cheer; And I, that have no interest in his scenes, Must bear the train of tragic kings and queens. Shall I support the weakness of his Muse?â Egadâif soâI'll fit him with abuseâ I'll soon dissect his fine-spun work, and shew That all his plot has more of farce than woe. For, after all, the creature's much deceiv'd, If e'er he thinks his tale can be believ'd. So tame and so inanimate his maid isâ How very different from our modern ladies!â What, could a blooming lass with ripen'd charms, Be held so long from her admirer's arms?â If such were truths in prudish heathen climes, Examples vary in our later timesâ Then for theatric playâhow poor! how cold! A heroine's language should be nobly bold, Outstrip the decency of vulgar life, Mouth at the heavens, and set the gods at strife.â Time was indeed, an antiquated bard Paid to a beldame, nature, some regard, And drew his females with such simple features, That all, who saw, believ'd them human creatures. Plain Desdemona bore no trace of art, And Portia play'd a wife's domestic part; While Constance shew'd, but what before we knew, And only griev'd, as real mothers do.â Shall this stale poet give the drama law, Who poorly copied only what he saw? Nay, stole from life, in every clime and age, The characters that fill his boasted page?â Well! as I live, 't is he!â(looking out)âO, are you come? Does all go well?âpoor devil!âseal his doom. This live-long night he watches every eye, Talks, like his heroes, in soliloquyâ Then starts asideâWhat! something goes amiss?â âSure 't is the distant murmur of a hiss!â Alas! kind soul!âI pity his condition, And will in his behalf this house petition:â To you, good folks above, for ever ready To serve a friend, all English hearts and steady; To you, ye men of candour, sense, and wit, Who fill the circle of this awful pit; To you, ye ladies, ever prone to spare The bard, who love and beauty makes his care; I here commend himâtake him to your favour, And I'll be surety for his good behaviour.</field>
