      <field name="fulltext">Appius and Virginia. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIDNEY, EARL of GODOLPHIN, Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Our Author's Friends appear concern'd to Day For the Success of this rough manly Play; While Britain seems to all that's soft inclin'd, What welcome here can our rude Romans find? Who Love without one word of whining Cant, And Rage without the buskind Bullies Rant. Whose Fire to Judgment rarely gives offence, But is maintain'd by Nature and by Sense. Rome warm'd by nervous Scenes for Empire fought, Such CÃ¦sar saw with Joy, with Joy such CÃ¦sar wrought. And Tragedy with bare appearance writ Of Roman Spirit, and of Roman Wit; Requires an Audience with them both inspir'd, And to the Like immortal Actions fir'd. True it requires all this, and therefore here W'indulge our fondest Hopes, and banish Fear; Why should not you Rome's manly Joys persue, When all that Fire that could the World subdue, Yes, all the Roman Spirit lives in you; Be witness that eternal Day Battle of Audenard. which quell'd The vanquish'd Gaul upon the wond'ring Scheld. Like Hannibal the crafty Vendome fled, While Britain fought like Rome, like Scipio Marlborough led; Vouchsafe ye Britons to support the Muse, Whose Flame your deathless Acts had Power t'infuse, By your great Deeds our Poet rais'd his Stile, And as he read of Wynendale and Lisle, His Romans with a fiercer Rage he drew Improv'd his noblest Characters by you. His Soul t'immortal Heights your Glory fir'd, And British Acts these Roman Scenes inspir'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Well Sirs! You have seen Virginia die! Ye Powers The mighty difference between her Time and ours. Virginius, an old Captain was of Rome, Who absent with his City Bands from home; Heard a Hot Courtier would his Girl engage; When posting back to Rome in mighty Rage This Son of Hector, like a surly Bully, Kills his poor Child to disappoint her Gully. That 'tis far otherwise with us is plain, While City Captain here makes short Campaign, In Bunhill-Fields subduing France and Spain. How oft has Courtier maul'd both Wife and Daughter? Yet no such bloody Business follow'd after. There's something in Virginia stranger still, Whom at her own request her Sire did kill, For fear she should be pleas'd against her Will, When will a Damsel of our City strain Resolve to die e'er Ease her Lover's Pain? But now to finish all in a more serious vein. Virginia's Death did Liberty restore, As from Lucretia's Tomb it rose before, When CÃ¦sar afterwards enslav'd the State, Porcia rous'd Brutus to great CÃ¦sar's Fate. Tho' Rome in Heroes always did abound, Still from her Women she lost Freedom found. So fair Britannia o'er the World is fam'd For Men of dauntless Spirits and untam'd; But yet when by her Folly or her Fate, Her Liberty was in a dangerous State. The Blessing ne'er cou'd be secur'd by Man, But Heav'n reserv'd th'immortal Fame for Anne.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE, Rome. Enter Lucius Icilius, Marcus his Brother. L. Icil. My Brother! M. Icil. My dearest Brother! Welcome! L. Icil. Came my last Letters safe to you? M. Icil. They did: And I have summon'd all our Friends, And e'en this Now expect them. L. Icil. I sent Virginia notice of my arrival, She once was wont upon the shortest absence, To fly upon the warmest Wings of Love Into the eager Arms of her Icilius; But now deludes my Hope, and starves my Eyes. M. Icil. They say, she takes repose to which her Eyes Have strangers been, for these three feavourish Nights. L. Icil. Virginia languishing, and Rome expiring! What have the Gods resolv'd to do with me? With me; who have no Soul, no Life, no Being, Unless for thee; O! Rome, and thee Virginia! Enter Valerius. Val. My best Valerius, welcome to my Arms! Patron of Liberty! Rome's genuine Son, But see our Countries other hope, Horatius! Horatius hail! Enter Horatius. Hor. Lucius Icilius!âHail! Thy Summons I have eagerly obey'd, And all the Blood of the Horatiis rous'd, In expectation of th'important Things Which thou hast made me hope from thee. L. Icil. Hail to my Uncle, Publius Numitorius, And thou, O Caius, welcome! Enter Publius Numitorius, Caius his Son. P. Num. Welcome to Rome! what News brings Lucius hither? L. Icil. Can there be stranger News than that ten Men Shou'd Lord it o'er two hundred thousand Romans, Each single Roman, braver than the Ten? P. Num. What News from th'Army near FidenÃ¦'s Walls? Hor. How fares the darling Hero of the Legions, The noble Prop of his declining Country; The pride of Rome, the glory of the Field! Th'invincible DentatusâHow bears he Th'insults of our ten Tyrants? L. Icil. How just enquiry has Horatius made? 'Tis of Dentatus, that I come to speak; And tell you that Rome's Champion is no more; But near to old FidenÃ¦'s fatal Walls, By fifty Assassines, his Head lies low; Yet his great Soul expir'd not unreveng'd, But twenty of his Murderers first he slew. Hor. How! murder'd! L. Icil. Yes, basely, and most barbarously murder'd! Is Murder, then, a sound so strange at Rome, When ye behold each day her bravest Sons Or basely scourg'd, or barbarously slain? When he who dares but Look a free born Soul, Grows strait suspected to the accurst Decemvirs, And chiefly to the insolence of Appius, The Tyrant of the Nine as they of Rome. Can ye then wonder, that the brave Dentatus, Who breath'd forth nothing but immortal Fame, Immortal Liberty, had been for thirty Years Rome's Champion, and his manly Breast, her Bulwark, Who shrunk not from her, in a hundred Fields, But with the utmost hazard of his Life, Perform'd a thousand Actions every Year, That from destruction sav'd her noblest Off-spring, Sav'd almost half the Lives of our Patritians, Sav'd Rome, recover'd the proud Capitol, Who was adorn'd with twenty golden Crowns Civic and MuralâSeam'd with fifty Scars Illustrious all, all in his manly Front, More to be valu'd than a hundred Crowns, Can ye admire, that this unequal'd Man Shou'd grow the Terror of the proud Decemvir? Or can ye admire that whom they fear they Murder? All. Murder'd by them? L. Icil. By whom, but by the Author of all ill; By proud, presumptuous, overlooking Appius, Who sent Dentatus Legate to the Camp; Then to his Collegues, wrote a learned Scrol, To hire Assassinates, who might in secret Dispatch him on that sacred Message sent. Val. The blackest Punishments of Hell reward him! L. Icil. Yes, yes, with reason ye may rage ye Romans; For who that is but Man, can calmly hear, Of so much Villany, of so much Cruelty, Such base Perfidiousness, so black a Treason, Attended with that Pride, that Arrogance, Who can once see that proud presumptuos Look, But he must burn with generous Disdain? Val. Oh damn him! Hor. Furies seize him. L. Icil. To think that one so abject by our baseness Shou'd lord it with high Looks, should have the power Of Life and Death, and murder us, for pastime? Shou'd use the Power we gave him to make Laws, To drive all Law from out his bleeding Country, Retain the Office given him for a Year, Beyond that Year, and set no bounds to Tyranny, Who can reflect without avenging Fury Upon the high deserts with which h' acquir'd This absolute Command, when he who looks So proud, so haughty, so contemptuous now Once basely flatter'd, and more basely fawn'd Upon the very Lees, and Dregs of Rome; With a dissembl'd Mildness cloak'd his Rage; With deep Humility conceal'd his Pride; With courteous Airs his Insolence disguis'd; Debauching with vile Arts like a lewd Whore Th'Affections of the meanest Sons of Rome, And yet this wretch, who when he sought his Power, Cring'd but to day, before the vilest Roman, The very next, when he had gain'd that Power Grew haughty, fierce and insolent at once, Nay, with Contempt outragious, not to be born, Not to be thought of, without Death, and Vengeance; The Tyrant scourg'd, or barbarously murder'd, The very Slaves on whom the former Sun Had seen him basely fawn. Val. The Traytor! L. Icil. Yes, this is the great Author of our woe, Yes, this is he, who murder'd great Dentatus, And who this moment meditates the means, To do as much for him, for you, for me, For every brave, for each distinguish'd Roman, While we look tamely on, tamely as Sheep, That one by one are from each other snatch'd, And hurry'd to the Slaughter. Hor. But know the Legions of Dentatus death? L. Icil. All! all! Val. Now come to the important Question, Lucius, How bear the Legions brave Dentatus death? L. Icil. Ay, that's the Question which I here by Fate Deputed come to answer. The Legions bear their darling Hero's death, As Supreme Jove then bears with mighty Crimes, When in his spacious Hand, he rowls the Threefork'd Bolt, Preparing to discharge the grumbling Thunder. Some in hoarse murmurs threaten, others stand Moping with sullen silence, stupid grief, Hungry and Pale, and pining for Revenge; Some from their Blood-shot Eyes, dart gloomy Rage, And some to their Companions cry aloud, Oh that the Bounteous Gods wou'd send us Chiefs, Who had but Spirits worthy to Command us. Hor. Oh noble Sound! V. There's Rome, there's Life, there's Liberty in this! L. Icil. What wonder, the impatient Legions cry, What wonder, if the Nations all take Arms, Justly disdaining Empire shou'd be there Where Liberty's no more. What do we here against our Sabine Foes? What wonder if FidenÃ¦âsees us fly, As Hoary Algidumâof late beheld Our other Army flying from the Ãqui: How shou'd we conquer Nations, Brave and Free, Who are so base as to be Slaves to Appius? Why shou'd we Conquer, when we fear Success, Fear Victory, when still the bravest Man, And he who most Illustrious Acts performs, Works Ruine for himself. Hor. 'Tis Just, and Brave! L. Icil. Lead us against the Sabines, and we fly, We'll neither Fight against our selves, Nor Fight for cruel Appius. Lead us to Rome, lead us against our Tyrant; And then we will be Men once more, Once more we will be Romans. Val. O! all ye immortal Gods! Let us to Horse without delay, and Head them! L. Icil. Spoke like the purest Blood of brave Poplicola. Hor. Valerius speaks for all. All but P. Num. For all, for all. Let us to Horse immediately, and Head them. P. Num. Hold! why to Horse, why to FidenÃ¦'s Walls, Appius is here, even here in Rome he Lords it; Removing Appius, we remove the Ten, His subtle Arts establish'd this Command, His Fire ferments, and Animates the Nine, And His discernment from them wards the Blows Which else e'er this had prov'd the Blows of Fateâ Appius remov'd, the Legions, and the Tribes, Will soon forsake the wretched Nine, his Tools; What need we then to old FidenÃ¦ run? Why should we Strangers trust with that Design Which we may execute by Friends alone? Horatius, and Valerius, are your Friends And Clients, and Dependants ready Arm'd. Hor. That our own Safety has long since requir'd: But see, Cornelia, Sister to Virginius, A Matron worthy Rome in nobler Times, Equal in every Virtue to the Best, Above them in the Greatness of her Mind. Enter Cornelia. Corn. My Message my Intrusion must Excuse, Lucius Icilius, 'tis to thee I come; Lord Appius has sent word that in two Hours He will be here in Person. L. Icil. Who! Corn. Lord Appius. L. Icil. Lord Appius, will be where? Corn. Here, in my Brother's House. L. Icil. Here in Virginius House, impossible! He knows its Master bears him deadly Hatred; What shou'd he come for? Corn. What shou'd the Tyrant come for? When Tarquin glutted was with other Crimes, And satiated with Rapins, and with Murder, Then the young Tyrant to Collatium went To visit Chast Lucretia. L. Icil. For which the Dog lies Howling now in Sulphur. But let Dire Appius know then Brutus rose Hor. And Horace. Val. And Valerius. L. Icil. And made the trembling Tyrant gnash his Teeth, And curse the Hour in Anguish of his Soul, That e'er he saw Lucretia. Corn. Ten Messages has haughty Appius sent On a detested purpose to Virginia, Us'd every baser Artifice to gain her, Promis'd, and vilely Threaten'd, Flatter'd, Fawn'd. L. Icil. The Plagues of Jove, and his blue Lightning blast him! Corn, But thou might'st trust her, Lucius, with the Wretch Who tempted cold Diana, or with him Who the dissembl'd Majesty of Juno Embrac'd with Empty Arms: Thou know'st Virginia's Tenderness of Soul, Soft as the Down upon the Wings of Cupid; Yet warm as is the God's own Heart to thee. Thou know'st th'abhorrence which she bears to Vice, How she starts wildly from the Thought of Guilt Or of Dishonour, then do thou be judge With what Astonishment, with what Convulsions Her Soul receiv'd these Messages from Appius; A Feaver dangerous to Life ensu'd. L. Icil. O give me Patience, Heaven, or grow thou Enrag'd like me, and hurl th'avenging Thunder Corn. Lucius, this Villain is below the Thunder; Believe thy self the Delegate of Heaven T'avenge thy Rome, and thy Virginia wrong'd. L. Icil. O! Revenge! Revenge! Corn. By Duty, and Affection both, she's thine, By Spousals not to be dissolv'd, Betroth'd, And nought but Sacred Rites are wanting now To make the loveliest Maid entirely thine, That Rome, or lovely Italy can Boast, Those Sacred Rites too, are just now preparing. And e'er the Sun rowls twice more round the Heavens, Thou'lt be completely blest. Then, Lucius, I address my self to thee, To know what answer I must send to Appius. Hor. Let good Cornelia send the Tyrant word She is preparing all things to receive him. L. Icil. What means Horatius! Val. O! by all means receive him! L. Icil. Receive him! how receive him! Val. Warmly, as Patriots should receive a Tyrant, Let us receive him Lucius, let us grasp him, Not by the Hand, but by the faithless Heart; Hast thou a Dagger, and could'st ask that Question, What Roman wants one here? L. Icil. I want not one by Heaven! M. Icil. Nor I. C. Num. Nor I. P. Num. Nor I. And tho' this Hand by Age enfeebl'd shakes, When lifted at proud Appius, 'twill be firm; Or if it Trembles then, 'twill be for fear, Least it should miss his Heart. Val. Let but the Tyrant come within my reach, And if my nervous Hand then miss his Heart, Like ScÃ¦volaâthe Traytor I'll disown, And burn it Piece-meal from my honest Limbs. M. Icil. There spoke the Soul of Mucius; Appius dies. All, The Tyrant dies, he dies! L. Icil. Oh noble fury! Oh! the matchless Fire! I hear in every Voice, and see in every Eye, By Heaven Revenge, Revenge is to be had, Vengeance, and Liberty, Children of Jove, Down from their Native Sky, come hand in hand, Our Gods, our Guardian Gods, are here amongst us. Then as our Hearts are join'd, join all our Hands, And let us kneel, and solemnly let's Swear. Swear by the Gods of Rome, those very Gods That are amongst us now, amongst us here, Inspiring us with more than mortal Minds. All. Let's Swear. [Kneel. L. Icil. By Romulus, the Founder of our Empire, Now Great Quiriunsâour propitious God. All. We Swear. L. Icil. By Mars, whose Influence from so small a rise Rais'd Rome to this Magnificenceâ All. We Swear. L. Icil. By Supreme Jove, the Stayerâwho sav'd the State, At Romulus's call, and has decreed To make his Romans his Vicegerents here, To Rule this under-world. All. We Swear. L. Icil. By all the Powers of Earth, and those of Hell, By the Infernal King, the Fates, and Furies, And by our Great Fore-father's mighty Shades, By Brutus, by Horatius, by Poplicola, Whose awful Ghosts we here invoke to rise, And with their mighty Spirits fill our Minds; We Swear, as here our Hands are join'd in one, So shall our Daggers meet in Appius Heart, As soon as here we have him in the Toyles. All. So shall our Daggers meet in Appius Heart, As soon as here we have him in the Toyles. [Rise. P. Num. The Tyrant will this guilty visit make Unguarded, or attended by a few, Howe'er, against the Worst we must provide; Let each Man here alarm those faithful Friends, Whom he can with the Fate of Rome entrust, And introduce them to this place in Person, And here, within an Hour, all meet again, Icilius, only you must here remain To comfort sad Virginia, and conceal Your presence from the Tyrant, who depends Upon Virginius her Father's absence And on his Ignorance of thy Return. L. Icil. 'Tis done. Now Night attended by MegÃ¦ra rife, And thy deep Silence, and thy dismal Shades Redouble, while to th'infernal King We offer up this dreadful Sacrifice. Thou Rome, from thy Lethargick Slumber rowse, And as the Mother of the Gods with Pride And Joy her deathless Progeny Surveys; Behold thy Godlike Sons assembl'd here, And in their matchless Spirits, wondring fee, Mars, and Great Jove, come down, to set thee free.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Lucius Icilius, Virginia. Virg. How I have suffer'd since thou left'st me, Lucius, Heaven only knows. L. Icil. How thou shalt be Reveng'd, both Heaven, and Earth, And Hell shall know. Virg. Left to my self, thou absent at FidenÃ¦, My Father in the Camp on Hoary Algid: Each Hour I thought dire Appius wou'd have come, And with th'Apprehension, still I tremble. L. Icil. Prophetick were thy Fears, the Tyrant comes. Virg. Ah Gods! thou kill'st me Lucius! L. Icil. Perish Ten Thousand Tyrants first, like Appius. Virg. Didst thou not say, he comes? L. Icil. He comes this very moment. Virg. Just Heaven! for what? L. Icil. To die: Know here in Ambush lies his Fate, Thou shalt see Twenty Daggers plung'd at once Into his Impious Breast, and be reveng'd For all the base Affronts the Tyrant offer'd. But see my Brother Marcus comes in haste, And in his looks a high concern appears, His Blood flows mantling o'er his wrathful Face, Th'avenging Genius of Majestick Rome Shines on his dreadful Brow. The Tyrant comes. Enter Marcus Icilius. Is it not so, my Marcus? M. Icil. It is; from his accursed Gates I watch'd him, Along the Sacred way, he hither Steals, Attended by four Lictors, like a Thief Who comes by Night to unhoard the precious Cash Of some substantial Usurer. L. Icil. Are our Friends come, Horatius and Valerius? M. Icil. 'Twill be yet half an hour e'er th'are ready, But Appius in few Minutes will be here. L. Icil. While I endeavour to confirm Virginia, Thou, Marcus, near the Door, his entrance watch, and let the Bell give notice of his coming. Virg. Say, Dost thou Love me, Lucius? L. Icil. Let my Eyes answer thee. Virg. If e'er thou Lov'st Virginia, let me go E'er cruel Appius comes. L. Icil. Appius will come before our Friends arrive, And will be gone, unless Virginia stays him. Virg. My Heart is form'd of such a tender Mold, I ne'er cou'd see the vilest Creature Die. L. Icil. I know thy wondrous tenderness of Nature, But call the greatness of thy Understanding, Call all the force of Virtue to thy Aid; Think that the Gods, whom thou so warmly serv'st, Have chosen thee the glorious Instrument Of freeing Rome, that under Appius Groans, Think, think, that by the part which thou shalt bear In such a glorious Action, thou'lt oblige Rome, and the Gods, who have predestin'd Rome To be the mighty Mistress of the Universe. Virg. The Gods of every Virtue are possess'd, 'Tis the possessing all which makes them Gods, Not so are Mortals, but from Heaven derive, Those which at first the forming hand of Jove Fitted their Earthly Organs to receive. Thus Man in Power, and Intrepidity, And great Revenge, the Image is of Heaven Woman in soft Compassion, and in Mercy; The nobler Virtues I admire, and Love, Which shine so bright in my Icilius Soul, But humbly am content to practise those Which fit the softness of my Sex, and Temper. L. Icil. But yet the Power which form'd the Nations made His Romans of a different Strain from all, To Roman Women he gave nobler Souls Than e'en to Men of other Nations, Women Have nobly serv'd t'advance his great Design, The boldness of Hersilia, and her Friends Made Rome the Mistress of the Sabine Soil, Lucretias, Virtue, Liberty restor'd, Clelia defending it was more than Woman, Nay more than Man of any other Nation. And thou Virginia, art ordain'd by Heaven, To free us from insulting Appius's Rage, And re-establish'd Liberty for ever. But heark! the Tyrant comes, [Bell rings. Now, now, Virginia, summon all thy Virtue, Summon Rome's injur'd Genius to thy aid, The Gods who gave thee all this wondrous Beauty, To enslave the very Soul of the proud Wretch, Who thinks it Great his Country to enslave, Will, if invok'd, infuse into thy Breast, A Spirit worthy, of that matchless Form, And then this barb'rous Tyrant thou'lt receive, With all that indignation and disdain That worthy is of Rome, and worthy me. But if at last thy sinking Spirits fail thee, Before the purple Scene of Death begins, Thrice shall the Larum strike thy trembling Ear, To give thee timely notice to retire. [Exeunt. [Manet Virginia sola.] Virg. The Almighty Powers who human Nature form'd Which at your pleasure ye can raise, or change, Who, of so soft, so merciful a Mold Have made me, and have made me yet a Roman, O pour into my pure unspotted Breast, A Beam of your great selves, that I at once Your Terrors and your Mercies may assume, May shew a soft, and yet a Roman Soul, May flash such Light'ning in this Tyrant's Face, Such horror and amazement in his Soul, That he may have a sense of all his Crimes, And may repent, and live. Enter Appius, Fulvius. App. Fulvius! Ful. My Lord! App. Keep you without, and on your Life, be watchful, Entering, I two audacious Slaves observ'd, One dar'd to cast a look of Scorn upon me, The other darted Beams of murdrous Spight, I like it not, as thou art faithful to me, Be diligent and watchful. Ful. My Lord, I will. [Exit. App. Madam. Virg. Bless me! What are you? App. One who commands in every place but this. But here I come, to obey. Virg. Who are you? App. Appius. Virg. Appius, they say, is insolent and fierce, Thou hast the usage of an humble Slave. App. You see your Power. Virg. My Power! App. Nay, give the Slave you torture leave to groan. Virg. I torture you! you wrong me, But to be falsly accus'd is usual now; Till now I never saw you, never thought of you, Nay see you not, and think not of you now. App. Confusion! Can I bear this! Then blush Ambition at thy restless toil T'acquire unbounded Power, of which a Girl Has influence to deprive thee. [aside. Yet me you force each day, and all the day To behold you, and for the lovely sight I pay down all my Bliss, and all my Power, That boundless Power which cost me so much Time, And so much Thought, and my whole peace of Mind! Into my presence every hour you press Upon my intimate Retirements, press, My Guards that keep out Death, can't keep out you. Virg. O wondrous Wisdom, godlike Power of Mind! O Man deserving to command an Empire! So absolutely thou command'st thy self, Such divine Care thou tak'st of those thou rul'st, Now when they're tottering on the brink of Fate. App. A Face less beautiful than that which now, Compels me Empire to forsake for Love; Has oft from Heaven allur'd the gazing Gods, And made 'em stoop to be more happy here, But if thy Charms before were so resistless From thy inimitable Form alone, Now, now be judge of their Almighty Power, Now thy sweet Voice has blest my ravish'd Ears, While from thy Lips flows Eloquence Divine, Wisdom accomplish'd e'en in earliest Bloom, As if the Gods had smish'd thee with Care, And then instructed thee, and sent thee down, To give Mankind, a taste of Bliss eternal: Witness these Gods, who know the Heart of Appius; I'd rather have Virginia mine, than Empire. Virg. I am Icilius's, and he is mine. Both by indissoluble Contract bound. App. That Contract, I by boundless Power dissolve. Virg. That Contract is inforc'd by your own Laws. App. For others, not my self, I form'd those Laws. Virg. The Gods themselves are bound by their own Laws. App. The Gods I know not; I am bound by none. Virg. But I am bound by all. App. But I, with your Obedience, can dispence, Virg. With Justice, Jove himself, can ne'er dispence, For ceasing to be Just, he ceaseth to be Jove. App. A Face like thine has made him oft unjust, And oft intrench upon the marriage Vow. Virg. Fictions of idle Bards! App. Once more, I say, your Contract I'll dissolve. Virg. As soon you may divide our faithful Hearts, And Love's as much above thy Power, as Fate. App. And are you of my Rival then, so fond, Virg. Like Life I Love him, for in him, I live. App. You must forget him. Virg. For him alone, I all things have forgot. App. You must be mine. Virg. I see thee not, Icilius is between us, And interceps my sight. App. Come, come, you shall be mine. Virg. Ay, now thou shew'st thy self, Thou art that proud, that stormy Tyrant, Appius, All thy deformity of Mind breaks out Upon thy cruel Face, and blasts my Eyes. App. Furies! Was ever Insolence like this? But 'tis with Justice, we are us'd with scorn, When we forego the Lordship, Nature gave us, Basely submitting, where we ought to rule; No whining now, no more unmanly moan, I will command thee now, doubly command thee, As I am Man, and as I lord it, here; I'll humble your proud Scorn, and what's deny'd To my soft Prayer, by boundless Power, I'll take, To thee, like Jove to Semele, I'll come, And will with Light'ning, and with Thunder clasp thee. Virg. Vain Man, is insolent, and proud, because He's ignorant, or thoughtless of his Fate; Say, wer't thou to expire the following Moment, Thou know'st not but thou may'st; Would'st thou then talk thus? App. Yes, well hast thou instructed me, Since Death for ought I know this hour may come, The dearest Joy that Life can give, I'll grasp, And seize upon it, now. Virg. Ha! Have a care! thou know'st not where thou art, App. Where I am sovereign Lord, and uncontrolable. Virg. Tyrant, no! The injur'd Genius of majestick Rome The Gods, and this control thee. [Holds up a Dagger. App. No, every where in Rome, I, I am absolute. Virg. Vain, wretched Man, Jove, only Jove is absolute, And thou the very Slave and Tool of Fate. That Jove is absolute who me inspir'd To throw my soft, and tender Nature off, And speak in his own Language, speak in Thunder, To tell thee thy dire Crimes have reach'd their height, Thy Perjuries, thy violated Vows, Thy Rapines, thy Oppressions, and thy Murders; And now the Hour ordain'd for Vengeance comes, Now sovereign Justice weighs thee in the Balance; And the astonishing Decree prepares That's coming out against thee; hark! even now! Hark! how the dreadful Thunder o'er thee growles, And is about to part with hideous roar. Ah wretched Creature, trembling on thy Knees Implore sweet Mercy of th'offended Powers, For Heaven and Earth, are leagu'd to thy destruction. App. Ha! thou art strangely mov'd! Who told thee this? How! Fulvius pale and trembling, oh damnation! I'll some directions to my Client give, And in a Moment wait on you. Enter Fulvius. Virg. Ye eternal Gods, who govern this great World, And rule the Heart of Man, and thou great Jove, To whom are sacred Hospitable Rights, Turn, turn the Heart of this detested Tyrant, Let his Repentance, for his Crimes atone, That his destruction may not blast my Eyes Nor Pierce my Ears, nor his polluting Gore Our houshold, hospitable God's prophane. App. Arm'd Men within these Walls! in Vizours too! The publick Doors made fast by Massy Bars, Some of our noblest Romans strait expected, With their Dependents, Clients, and their Friends. Fulv. To be admitted by a secret Passage, Which where it lay, the mercenary Slave Whose Tongue, my Gold unty'd, wou'd never tell. App. Unless we 'scape by Artifice, we're lost. Fulv. Had they not all been bound by solemn Oath To act in Consort, we had now been dead. App. How soon are they expected? Fulv. Within an Hour at farthest. App. Be thy Behaviour such as nought had happen'd, In every thing conformable to mine; Divinest of thy Sex; thou more than Woman! Goddess of Wisdom, who vouchsaf'st a while, To sojourn here, in mortal Shape below, And by the sight of thy CÅlestial Charms, T' allure the World to Virtue; O let me penitent, and prostrate fall, And grov'ling on the Earth, implore Forgiveness, Of thee whose constant Soul, the view of Empire, Nor fear of Death, nor what is worse than Death, Cou'd cause to swerve from Virtues strictest Paths. Virg. What do I see! Thy Soul is once more alter'd, For in thy Voice, no lofty Accent's found, No haughty Insolence is in thy Air, Nor cruel Pride on thy presumptuous Brow, Deplorable the Look, so terrible before, The Gods by me have surely touch'd thy Soul. App. 'Tis as the gracious Powers foretold it all. Virg. What Powers! App. Last Night, in the dread Silence of the Dark, When sleep resembles most his Brother Death, This frightful Vision shook my lab'ring Soul, In a vast Forest, desolate, and wild, By the dim Horrors of the dusky Moon, Benighted, and alone, I sadly stray'd, The frowning Heavens in fearful gloom appear'd, About my Head a blustring Tempest roar'd. And the Earth bellowing, underneath me shook, And like a Sea disturb'd by Winds, it wav'd, Then under me with monstrous Chasm it yawn'd, And I ten thousand, thousand Fathom fell, Nor stop't, till I the burning center reach'd, Saw the dire Secrets of th'infernal World, Beheld the Severe Judges of pale Ghosts, The Furies, and th'inexorable King, Beheld the Molten Gold of flowing Styx, That casts a dismal Light, and scares the Damn'd. Virg. O Heaven and Earth! 'tis terrible, it shakes me! App. Millions of Ghosts, that star'd with stony Eyes, And gnash'd with Iron Teeth, I there beheld, Toss'd from the Banks, amidst the flaming Gold, And plung'd by Red-hot Prongs of Snaky Furies; 'Twas in that place my Father's awful Ghost Appear'd, and with a hollow groan, cry'd Appius! Why Appius, hast thou sacred Rome opprest, Why hast thou strove to tempt from Virtue's Paths, The tenderest, faithfull'st, and the chastest Maid, That Breaths th'Ãtherial Air; for what thou hast done, Soon shalt thou hither come a guilty Ghost, And new unheard of Torments Hell invents Against thy dire approach; yet one way's left T'avoid this infinite abyss of woe; By swift Repentance, and severe Remorse Obtain forgiveness of offended Mercy; For she is Mercy's self sent down from Heaven With her sweet look, to sooth the Cares of Mortals. Virg. Oh! Horrour! Horrour! how had'st thou the Power, Such impious words prophanely to pronounce, After this dreadful Vision of the Night. App. I, as an empty Dream, despis'd it all. Virg. What makes you now regard it? App. The Gods by thee, convince me, that 'tis true, I hear it in thy Voice, I see it in thy Eyes; Divinity is in thy troubl'd Face, And Heaven is in thy Air, By thee, the gracious Gods, have touch'd my Soul. [Bell Rings. Virg. O! all ye Powers! hark! hark! the Knell of Death, That dreadful Larum Summons thee to Hell, That Hell which thou so terribly describ'st; Swear thy Repentance is sincere, or else Thou dy'st the following moment. App. Sincere as is thy Virtue, or may Death; May instant Death rush in upon my Soul, And send me down to suffer those dire Torments, Which now the cruel Host of Hell prepares for me. Virg. Swear then that Rome is from this moment free, And thou wilt never dare t'approach me more. App. By my dread Father's awful Ghost, I Swear, By all th'unutterable Powers I saw In th'amazing Vision of the Night. Virg. Pass thro' that Door, then turn upon the left, And by the glimmering of a winking Lamp Thou'lt spy a Postern Gate, and here's the Key Which still I have kept t'avoid thy Violence, By this thou may'st escape. [Bell Rings. Ah Wretch! this Moment fly, or thou art lost. [Exit App. For the last time the fatal Larum Rings, [Bell Rings. Pray Heaven he's gone, or else I must prepare My Ears to hear his last expiring Groans, My Eyes to see him weltring in his Blood, And all our Hospitable Rights prophan'd. Enter L. Icilius, M. Icilius, Horatius, Valerius, Publius Num. Caius Num. L. Icil. Death and Destruction will no longer wait, No longer will arrest their lifted Arms, Rome and Virginia urge our Daggers home. Ha! where is the Traytor? Virg. He's gone. L. Icil. Confusion! gone? Hor. The Gods forbid. Val. The Fate of Rome defend it. L. Icil. No, he's not gone, thy Tenderness wou'd save him. Virg. 'Tis his own Virtue and Remorse have sav'd him. For oh so mild, so humble, and so chang'd, So Penitent is he! L. Icil. He Penitent! oh, damn the vile dissembler! Suppose he were, after a thousand Crimes, All of the fearfull'st, of the blackest hue, After he has bound, and robb'd, and murder'd Rome, Shall he be quit for half an Hour's remorse? He never shall, he's in the Toils, we have him, And every Roman here is Perjur'd, Damn'd, Who makes not Vengeance sure. Nor shall our Country lose the great Example; The noble Deed which we to Night perform, Shall blast a thousand Tyrants in the Bud; Ambition shall but hear the dreadful Tale, And trembling o'er the mortal sound, expire. Come, my Virginia says but this to try me. Virg. He's gone, by Heaven he's gone. L. Icil. Impossible! for Death himself stood Centry, And arm'd with twenty Darts, secur'd the Entrance. Virg. But Appius by the Postern Gate escap'd. All. Ha! P. Num. Then we are lost. L. Icil. All's lost! Val. Farewel Revenge. Hor. Farewel the hope of Liberty for ever. L. Icil. O cursed Chance! O fond Credulity! Virg. I tell thee, never Man was so much alter'd, And Rome's by this time Free. L. Icil. Rome is for ever lost, we all are lost, And thou, alas, the most undone of Women; O, by the Gods I pity thee, but why, O why hast thou reduc'd me to weak pity? P. Num. We must disperse, without delay disperse, Or soon the Tyrant with his Murdering Guard Will be upon our Lives, Icilius thou And thou my Son must haste to old FidenÃ¦, To hoary Algid, thou, O Marcus hie, T'inform Virginius of his Daughter's Danger; Publish thro' both the Camps the Tyrant's Dead, And then exhort the Troops to furl their Standards, And post away to Rome: Horatius thou, And thou Valerius keep thy Friends in Arms, And try to raise the murm'ring People here, I will to Claudius, Uncle to dire Appius, Whose grave Authority alone has Power To turn and bend the Stubborn Tyrant's Will; He may perhaps persuade him to desist From his accurst attempt. Let us be gone. All. Let us be gone away. Virg. What will become of me? Icilius stay. L. Icil. Not for the World. Virg. If e'er thou lov'dst me stay, I charge thee stay. L. Icil. No, To preserve Virginia, I must fly. Virg. Have I preferr'd Icilius to the World, And he deserts me at my extremest need? Ah! Can'st thou leave me to the Rage of Appius? L. Icil. You to the Rage of Appius! Madam! you! His Patroness! his Benefactress! you To whom he owes his Life! his very Being, Who sav'd him, when the World could not have sav'd him. Who frankly sacrific'd your Country to him, All your Relations, all your Friends at once, And your poor Lover above allâAdieu. Virg. Thou shalt not go, unless thou tear'st my Limbs from me T' attend upon my Heart. [Embraces him. L. Icil. Resolve to see me murder'd in your Arms, Who can defend you from the Tyrant then? See, where he comes amidst his cursed Guards. [Lets him go. Virg. Help, murder. Lucius, thou hast deceiv'd me, thou unkind one. L. Icil. Deceiv'd you, to preserve you, which nought now But a Revolt of all the Legions can, I, for that purpose to FydenÃ¦ fly, But soon depend upon it will return. Virg. O stay one Moment longer. L. Icil. No, tho' I feel the Pangs the dying feel, When Soul and Body part, I dare not stay, What ho within there? See Cornelia comes. Enter Cornelia. To thy dear Care, Cornelia, I commit My Life, my Soul, do thou conduct her safely. To Numitorius House, till my return Which shall be with the earliest Dawn of Morning. Farewel, my Life, farewel. [Exit. Virg. He's gone, and I shall never see him more, Ne'er see the sacred Fountain of my Life, Virginius more. Corn. Before to morrow's Sun has reach'd its height. They'll both be here, your Father and your Lover, FidenÃ¦ lies within the Ken of Rome, And Algidum but twelve Miles distant hence. Virg. The Tyrant will be here to Night; to Night, And who shall save me from his Fury now? Deliver me ye Gods, whom I have serv'd With so much Zeal, or if the rest forsake me, Come Death and save me from the Tyrant's Fury. Corn. Come think of Life, of Happiness, of Glory, Think of the warm and tender Love of Lucius. Virg. 'Tis hard indeed to dye, and think of Lucius, And I must try to live, this dreadful Night, I'll with my Uncle Numitorius stay, And if my Love returns not with the Day, To morrow to th'Asylum I'll retire Of aweful Vesta, and augment the Choir Of the chast Maids, who watch th'eternal Fire. [Exeunt. End of the Second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCENE. I. Enter Claudius, Publius Numitorius. Claud. Force? Can he barbarously threaten Force? P. Num. Yes; threaten both by Proxy and in Person; And one so proud, so cruel, and so fierce, As if that Nature form'd him for her ruin, Is more than like to bring these Threats to practice, And we have lost all hope to save Virginia, Unless you kindly shelter her from Fate. You only he respects, and you esteems The living glory of his noble Race; And your Authority has more than once Been known to bend his cruel Soul to Mercy: Then noble Claudius let me here conjure you, By the bright Honour of the Claudian Race, Which the black Crime that Appius now designs Is like to eclipse with fearful infamy; By the high Justice of the Cause it self, Have pity on Virginia's lost Estate. O did you but survey this mournful Maid, The Sight of her wou'd surely pierce a Soul Much harder to be mov'd, than that of Claudius. Claud. Virginia's danger surely moves me much, But oh this cursed Tyrant's moves me more; For oh he headlong to destruction runs And to eternal infamy. If he pursues his damn'd design, he's gone His Hour his come; and all his blustring rage (O dreadful scandal to the Claudian race) At the Foot of the Tarpeian Rock will fall. P. Num. Hark! Bless me, what noise is that which still grows nearer? Claud. Some Women in distress for succour shriek. P. Num. What is there violence committed here, Here, in the publick Streets of Rome, by Day? Now by yon Heaven 'tis poor Virginia's Voice. Claud. Is't possible? Nay then your fears were true. By Heaven 'tis she, and with her good Cornelia, And who pursues them? O ye immortal Gods! Fulvius, the Tyrant's most detested Creature; Who thinks his Master's Power will be perpetual, And hopes to raise his wretched Fortune by it. Let us a while observe him at a distance. Enter Virginia, Cornelia, Fulvius, and others. Virg. O Earth, and Heaven! What have I liv'd to hear? I charge thee come not near me. Corn. Prophane her not with thy detested touch. Virg. Nor hurt my Eyes with thy detested sight. Corn. Begone! Fulv. Yes, I will go, but not without Virginia. Virg. O help Diana! help eternal Vesta, Help all ye Powers, protectors of the Chaste! Corn. What does the Villain mean? Fulv. To seize upon my Slave where e'er I find her. You Rogues, who stand unmov'd like senceless Stones, Nay are not half so much alive as Statues, Dogs! Villains! bear her off, and do your Duty. Claud. Fulvius! Oh Fulvius! Fulvius! Stop I charge thee. 'Tis I, 'Tis Claudius who commands thee, stay. Virg. Just Heaven has heard my Prayer. Fulv. O my good Lord! Stop there ye Slaves a Moment, My noble Lord! You are a Friend to Justice; This is my Slave detain'd from me too long, By the unjust Oppression of Virginius. Virg. O ye immortal Gods! Corn. See if this Villain strikes not Claudius dumb, And harrows him with wonder. Claud. Is this thy Slave? O villany unheard old Unparallell'd! unpresidented Impudence! Hear me, and ponder what I tell thee well, For it concerns thee near. If thou believ'st I am a stranger to the damn'd design, Of which thou'rt made the execrable Tool, Thou err'st; and if thou ever lov'd'st thy self Repent, while yet 'tis given thee to repent, And on thy Knees implore this Lady's Mercy; E'en now repent, or now the Hour comes on When thou wilt curse thy self for unbelieving. And if thou think'st thy impious Lord can save thee, Vengeance divine will undeceive thee soon. He soon will want the Power to save himself; For he's a cursed Thing cast off by Jove, And to th'avenging Furies given up. Go tell him this from me. Fulv. My Lord, he'll in a Moment pass this way, This will sound better from your Mouth than mine. Claud. And by th'immortal Gods I'll tell him more; Yes, in his Ears I'll thunder such a Peal, As his Lethargick Conscience shall awake, And make him mad to cure him. Fulv. I humbly of your Lordship take my leave, And beg that with me I may take my Slave. Claud. Now by the Gods, name such another Word, I'll pour the Roman People in upon thee; And Ruin, like a Torrent, shall o'erwhelm thee. Thou o'ergrown Impudence! Thou frontless Villany! Can ought that looks like Heaven belong to thee? Cast but thy Eyes upon that lovely Face, Then try, if thou dar'st claim her as thy Slave? Alas I rave! thou want'st the very Power To look upon her with a stedfast Eye; The Bird of Night can sooner bear the Sun, Than thou the sacred influence of her Eyes. But with a guilty and a down cast Look Thou art compell'd to own that thou art aw'd By a superior and diviner Being. Fulv. My Lord! Your Lordship always cou'd speak well, But yet your Words were never yet our Laws; Therefore I must entreat my noble Lord Either t'allow this Woman to be mine, Or else that you and Publius Numitorius Wou'd give your solemn Words that in an Hour, She, whom you call Virginia, shall appear In her own Person in the publick Court, Where it may be determin'd by plain Law Whether she is my legal Slave or no. One or the other sure my Lord will grant, Or else he must obstruct the course of Justice. Claud. Justice! O Villain! Dar'st thou barely name her? The very sound shou'd make thee hide thy Head. As that of Thunder does the Foes of Gods. And do'st thou dare then to persist in this? Fulv. My Lord, I must, and will persist. Claud. I plainly see thou dar'st not but persist, Then here I give my solemn Word. P. Num. And I give mine. Both. That in an Hour Virginia shall appear. Fulv. Health and long Happiness attend your Lordship. And so my noble Lord I take my leave. [Exit. Claud. Yes, yes, she shall appear, let not that Thought Disturb thee; but yet e'er the Sun rowls round Thou'lt howling with thou had'st lost thy dearest Blood That she had ne'er appear'd. P. Num. See where amid'st his Guard the Tyrant comes. Claud. Do you conduct the Ladies, I'll expect him. P. Num. Come, sweet VirginiÃ¦, good Cornelia come, We must prepare t'appear before dire Appius. Short is our time, and we have much to do. Virg. My time is short indeed, but long enough, To shew I am a Roman, and no Slave. [Exeunt Virg. P. Num. &amp; Corn. Enter Appius. Claud. Decemvir stop a Moment. App. What wou'd my honour'd Uncle? Claud. Command your Lictors to withdraw a while, And keep the People at a greater distance. App. Guards let my Uncle be forthwith obey'd. Now what wou'd you Command me? Claud. I come to beg thee to Command thy self; I come to give thee warning of the Vengeance Which thou'rt about to pull from Heaven upon thee. App. For what? Claud. Dar'st thou, Created to Establish Law, Dar'st thou attempt a thing against all Law, Even Nature's Sacred and Original Law? App. What is this horrid thing? Claud. What? Dares the Judge of Rome commit a Rape? A Rape on a Free Woman? App. I commit a Rape? Claud. You. App. On whom? Claud. The young and blooming Daughter of Virginius. App. Who told you this? Claud. Why is she brought before thy black Tribunal On this most impudent pretence of Slavery? Who told me this? you take it for a Secret, When 'tis the universal Talk of Rome. App. Shou'd any Roman else but dare to talk thus, I'd make him howle, yes by the Gods I wou'd. Did I acquire this Independent Power To be control'd by the base Scum of Rome? I got it to control them, and to Ride them; To Ride them hard, and use the Spur or Rein As it seems good to me. Claud. If you go on, You'll find them but a wild and dangerous Beast, Who first will throw, then stamp upon their Rider. And dar'st thou rashly thus prefer thy self Before the Body of the Roman People? But this assure thy self, if thou proceed'st, The People whom so rashly thou contemn'st, Will make thee feel their Excellence; their Strength Will rise, and will revenge Virginia wrong'd, And pour down ruin on thy cursed Head. App. I fear them not, they say themselves are wrong'd, And yet you see they bear it. Claud. Because tho' all of them agree in thought, They know not one another, but when Heaven Would mighty Revolutions bring to pass, It always for a great occasion waits, That may awake and rouze the slumbring World And that occasion thou art going to give, To do the most provoking of all wrongs. The Roman People Have born thy Pride, thy Cruelty, thy Rapines, Thy horrible Oppressions, and thy Murders, And the same People bore all this from Tarquin: But when he basely came to force their Women, That rouz'd 'em from their long Lethargick slumber, Soon they appear'd true Off-springs of Love's Goddess; And like a half tam'd Lyon urg'd to madness, Aloud they roar'd, and ramping scar'd their Keeper. That which confounded Tarquin, Confounds thee; Yet Tarquin dy'd an Exile in his Bed, But thou wilt from the dreadful Rock be thrown. App. Well! Since at last I am compell'd to speak, Swear thou wilt keep the Secrets of our House, And I'll disclose my Soul to thee. Claud. I swear. App. Know then I love Virginia, even to madness love her; So desp'rate, so outrageous is my Flame, That to possess I'll venture any Death, Yes, the most Cruel and most Infamous, For fierce Desire extends me on the Rack, And of necessity I must possess, Or in most cruel Torments must expire. Claud. Die then with Infamy thou cursed thing, Thou Merit'st it; but has thy bleeding Country Deserv'd that thou should still inflict more Wounds? Think, think thou seest thy great Fore-fathers all Arise from Hell to fright thee from this Deed; And see old Appius Claudius at their Head, Thy awful and thy ever honour'd Father. Oh! had he but an Arm of Flesh and Blood, Degenerate Boy, to use a Father's right, Here in the midst of this polluted Forum, Here in the midst of all thy cursed Guards, He'd do what all my words want Power to do, And with his Dagger pierce thy cruel Heart. App. No more, thou troubl'st me, all this I give To my Relation, and the Claudian Race. But trouble me no more, I cannot bear it. Claud. Yes, tho' I die for't, thou shalt bear it all; But if thou can'st contemn the Claudian Race. If thou contemn'st thy dying Country's Groans, Which might have power to melt a Heart of Marble: If nought has force to move thy savage Soul, But the young blooming Daughter of Virginius, If e'er thou lov'dst her, for her sake desist. She is indeed so lovely, that she seems Form'd by the Gods to be desir'd by Men. But into what dire ruin art thou plunging This sweetest, loveliest, workmanship of Heaven? How will so damn'd a deed as thou design'st, Deface this wondrous Master-piece of Nature? Thou art about to rob her of that sweetness That charms the Eyes and Hearts of all Beholders; To render her contemptible and cheap To all the World, and odious even to thee, And to her self most loathsome, and for what? For a frail Joy so fading and so short, It dies before 'tis thought of; nay nor joy, For thy design has made her strongly hate thee, Detest thee, loath thee, utterly abhor thee. App. All this a thousand, thousand times I have thought, Have done whatever mortal Man cou'd do, To tear this cursed Passion from my Breast; Or else Hell's blackest Torments were my due. I have forborn my necessary Food, The Food that Health and Life it self requir'd; Have past the Livelong Nights in thoughts profound Without admitting slumber to my Eyes; Have weakned Life to mortifie my Passion, But like a strong Disease it still increas'd, And flourish'd in my weakness. Claud. Make an effort, a violent effort, Persisting thou grow'st hateful to the Gods, Detestable to all the Race of Men, And to thy self most loathsome and most horrible: You want not Reason if you wou'd exert it. App. I have no power t'exert this feeble Reason, For O some God, some cruel God has fixt This Madness of Desire within my Mind; Yes, 'tis the dire Effect of wrath Divine! For O I rave! I rave! a raging Feaver Shakes my Tempestuous Frame, devours my Blood, And scorches and consumes my inmost Marrow. In vain I struggle in the Toils of Fate, I struggle till I roar with burning Fury, Curse my false Stars, and partial Gods accuse. The more I struggle, I'm the more perplex'd, The more by strong Necessity involv'd, And Rage adds Force and Fury to my Love, And makes my Reason weaker. Come ye Claudii, Come ever glorious, ever honour'd Race, And thou old awful Appius at their Head, Ascend from Hell with all Hell's Rage about you, Come and survey this miserable Breast, And here's a sight will turn your Rage to Grief, And send you back to Hell with such a Tale As shall have power to move the damn'd to pity. Enter Tribune. Who art thou that presumptuously intrud'st Upon our private Talk? but by thy Garb, And by thy Air, thou shou'dst a Tribune be, Sent by my Collegues on important Matters. Trib. Yes, sent by the Decemvirs who Command The Legions that Encamp upon Mount Algid; Who send you Health and this [Gives Letters. App. Reads. The arrival in the Camp of Marcus, Brother to Lucius Icilius, the late Tribune of the People, has inclin'd the Legions to a Revolt, who threaten to pull up their Standards, and March directly to Rome. The News of your Death has been maliciously spread thro' the Camp, to animate the Legions to a Rebellion; and tho' we have produc'd Letters from you of a fresher date than the Report, yet still the Report prevails; several Tribunes and Centurions have already left the Army. If the Torrent encreases it will be too strong for us to stemm; assist us as soon as possible with your Counsels, and with your Power Farewel. Come to my House within an Hour, and there You Shall receive your answer. [Exit Tribune. Damnation! these presumptuous Rebels brave me; Yes, they pretend to force Virginia from me, To force my Empire from me, force my Life, Which spight of all their Fury I'll maintain: Let them come on, and by the Gods I'll face them With such a Spirit as shall damp their Rage, And strike it dead within their Coward Hearts As fiercest Beasts by Men resolv'd are Tam'd, I'll humble their rebellious Pride, I will, Shew them a Man, a Being that's above them, Born to Command, as they are Born to obey. Claud. What force can you oppose against the Legions Encamp'd on Algid's Mount? App. The other Army at FidenÃ¦'s mine. Claud. No, the other Army burns with noble Thirst Of great Revenge for their Dentatus Murder, Whom thou wilt now inflame beyond all Patience By injuring their other hope, Icilius. App. I have a stedfast Party in them all, Besides my Guards and Forces in the Town. Claud. Too few, too weak, too wretched to oppose The Solid Body of the Tribes and Legions. App. Then, by the Gods, I'll with them join the Foe, March at the Head of the Victorious Sabines, And lead the conquering Ãqui to these Walls; Sink this proud City in a Sea of Blood, And greatly ruin what I cou'd not Rule. Claud. Hadst thou directly thy descent deriv'd, From a successive Race of fifty Tyrants, Thou coud'st not speak one more: but be assur'd If thou'rt resolv'd on ruin, 'tis thy own; Our Patron Gods this City will defend, As soon thy miserable Fate will shew. App. Let the result be what it will, I'll on; For shou'd I now my high Command resign, And more ingloriously my Love forego, 'Twou'd all be imputed to ignoble fear. Yes, they wou'd brag they scar'd me like a Girl; That I my Mistress yielded like a Coward, And basely ran from boundless Power away. No, by yon glittering Lamp that Rules the Day, Eclipsing all th'inferiour Lights of Heaven, From hence I'll to my dread Tribunal go As a prÃ¦text to blind the stupid Crowd, Adjudge Virginia to be Slave to Fulvius. The Master o'er his Slave has Power of Life, Or Death, and that includes all other Powers; And Fulvius strait transfers his Power to me, And then, ye Gods, I'll seize th'enchanting Joy, And to the Heaven of Heavens my Raptures raise. Claud. Thou go'st from hence thou say'st to thy Tribunal. App. Immediately I go. Claud. I'll meet thee there and plead Virginia's Cause. App. You dare not. Claud. Tyrant I dare and will. App. Disclose my Secret, and your Life shall answer't. Claud. Ha! dost thou threaten me, degenerate Boy? I value this old Life at the same rate, As thou the old Honour of the Claudian House, But yet for my own sake I'll keep thy Secret; For never any of our noble Race Dar'd to betray his Trust excepting thee. But I'll do that which more a thousand times Shall gall and wring thy Heart. App. What will you do? Claud. I'll pour such strong Conviction on thy Soul, Even in the Eyes of all th'assembled People, As shall be follow'd by those dreadful Furies That wait upon Remorse, and punish mighty Crimes. Yes, they shall scourge thee with a scourge of Scorpions, And give thee a taste of Hell beforehand here. App. Thou talk'st in vain, I will persist till Death. Claud. 'Tis not thy wretched Life I go to save, I go to save the Honour of the Claudii, And shew th'assembled People that our House, Our noble House abhors such things as these; But thy Brute Soul was shuffled in among us By the mistake of some o'er hasty God. As for thy Life it is not worth my Care, That and thy Empire are already lost; And so to the revenging Gods I leave thee. [Exit. App. Well, if for Love I Empire must forego, While in her Arms the Joys of Heaven I know, I'll learn to scorn the wretched World below. [Exit. The End of the Third ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter P. Num. Caius. Cai. Oh honour'd Sir! P. Num. oh Caius welcome! oh a thousand welcomes! But where's Icilius, speak? Cai. Ye Gods! what dire Calamity has happen'd? I never saw you thus disturb'd before. P. Num. Oh! I have reason! yes we all have reason; But once more where's Icilius? Cai. He only staid to see the Forces March, And then resolv'd to post away to Rome. P. Num. What meanst thou? Cai. I left the Army furling all their Standards, And ordering all things for a speedy March, To meet the other Army on Mount Aventine. P. Num. The Gods be prais'd, then Rome's to morrow free, But oh! Virginia will be lost to Night, Do thou post back, and spur thy Courser hard, And bid Icilius hast to save Virginia. Cai. What must I say her danger is? P. Num. Oh I want time to inform thee; I must fly As fast as these old feeble Limbs will let me, And whisper to Virginia what I have heard, Our only hope now lies in gaining time. Cai. But I with speed came here before Icilius To summon you, Horatius, and Valerius, To meet him an Hour hence at his own House. P. Num. To urge that meeting be thy Father's care; From hence I'll to the Tyrant's black Tribunal, Then find Valerius and Horatius out, Now busied in associating our Romans. T'assert their Country's freedom, and their own. [Exeunt. SCENE Draws Appius, Claudius, Virginia, Cornelia, Attendants. Guards discover'd. App. What the Complainant urges you have heard, She whom you call Virginia is his Slave, Born of his legal Slave in his own House; From thence convey'd almost as soon as born, At the request of her reputed Mother, Wife to Virginius, thence suppos'd her own, And as her own brought up; this Fulvius urges, And this he binds himself to prove as soon As from Mount Algidum Virginius comes, Where he commands as PrÃ¦fect of a Legion, Till he returns then she remains with Fulvius. Claud. With Fulvius? Corn. Tyrant no! Virg. The Gods forbid! App. Till he appears who has right t'assert her Freedom, The Slave must in her Master's Power remain, So says the Law, and what that says is Justice. Virg. That I'm a Slave can never be deny'd, But, thanks to Appius, so is every Roman; Nay Rome our sacred Mother is no more, But tho' She is now a Slave, thou found'st Her Free, And I with Her had Liberty retain'd, Had Appius either Gratitude of Justice: But thou may'st find that still 'tis in my Power, To free my self, and Rome. Oh great Lucretia! Claud. Hear her! Is this the Language of a Slave? Art thou the Judge of Rome? Think, think, O Appius, The Father will be sent for, and consider, That Father once was thy most valued Friend, And endless were thy Obligations to him. How wilt thou bear his vast and boundless Grief, The Grief of such a Father, one so nice So tender of the Honour of his House, And of his Child so fond, he lives in her, He doats, and knows no joy in Life but her; How wilt thou bear his Looks, by Nature aweful, Now render'd terrible by mortal Wrong. How wilt thou bear Icilins's wrathful Eyes, And the o'erflowing Torrent of his Rage? App. I fear him not. Claud. If not for fear, at least for pity spare him; For what a Grief, and what a Loss will his be? Let cruel Appius take his place a Moment, And be the Lover of this charming Maid. App. I her Lover! Claud. Does that offend thee? Cast thy Eyes around, And view this numerous People, view them nearly, View thy own Guards, see who are not her Lovers, See how with Eyes and Hearts they all adore her. Now take a stedfast View of her thy self. Ha! thou art struck, yes by the Gods thou'rt caught, And Love triumphant sits upon thy Brow. App. Mov'd, but not alter'd. Claud. Yes, thou this Moment hast a Heart of Flesh, And art not more inhumane than thy Murderers? How can'st thou then resolve the very next To throw off Nature; be a cursed Fiend, T'inflict a Torment which Hell never knew, For if Virginia's given to this wretch; To be by him abandon'd to the Power Of some more glorious Villain, who suborns him, Who proudly thinks he has a Right t'enjoy What e'er his fancy unconfin'd desires, And whose licentious Will's his only Law; Consider how thou robb'st her in a Moment Of all that e'er was counted dear to Mortals, Her Friends, Relations, Father, Lover, Country, All lost, and all at once! O fathomless Abyss of endless woe! O infinitely miserable Maid! App. You've spoke at large, and we have heard with patience, Nor would I here before the Roman People Disgrace the Eldest of the Claudian race! Uninterrupted therefore have you spoke. But you presume too much on this relation, And to discharge this Slave wou'd raise the People. All we can do for her, and for Virginius, Is to secure her honourable Usage Till his return; which here we strictly promise. So Fulvius take your Slave. Claud. O Tyrant! Corn. O Villain! amazing Villain! Virg. Ye Powers who view the inmost Thoughts of Mortals, What have I done to merit this? Enter Publius Numitorius. P. Num. Ha! pale and trembling, and astonish'd all. Icilius comes, gain all the time you can, And sooth this impious Judge. Virg. Lord Appius, I have things of highest moment Of which I must inform you, and adjure you To give me Audience e'er you leave the Forum. [Exeunt. Manet Appius, Virginia, Guards. App. Guards keep at distance. What are your Commands? Virg. Look upon me well; Appius, thou know'st me not, for if thou did'st Thou wou'd'st not, nay thou coud'st not use me thus. Is then last Night so utterly forgot? App. No, never, never, will it be forgot. Virg. Then by the Terrors of that dreadful Death From which thou wert deliver'd by my Hand, By the more dreadful Torments of the Damn'd By which you swore, and which even then had seiz'd you, Had not I cast a Look of mercy on you, Revoke this cruel and unjust Decree. App. That upon you depends, for be but mine And you're not only Free, but Great and Glorious. Virg. You know you ask what is not in my Power, I have already told you I'm another's. App. Damnation light on him! What cursed charm, What Philter has he us'd to touch thy Heart? Virg. The Charm, the Philter, which he us'd was Love. App. Let it be try'd by Love who best deserves thee, And he is lost, undone. A formal Wedlock, and an equal Dowry, Are the dull Proofs that every Fool can give Of a gross vulgar Passion: but fond Maid, What has he done? What has he suffer'd for you? The greatest Sacrifice that Man can make To Woman, not to Goddess, is Ambition; That darling of my Soul to you I Sacrifice, And for the passing Pleasure of a Moment At once I venture Empire, Life, and Fame. For well I know the act to which you force me, Will soon endanger all. Virg. I force you? App. Yes, Cruel, to despair and dye you force me, And shew no pity in the very Hour When for your self you ask it e'en of me. Virg. Why do you ask such things I dare not think of? And much less hear? App. He who can sacrifice Ambition to you, Will sacrifice the World, and therefore know, That all that I desire, is Holy, Just; Marriage shall join us by its sacred Rites, And you my Heart and Empire shall command. Virg. Patritians still must Marry with Patritians, 'Tis your own Law; my Father's no Patritian. App. That Obstacle's remov'd, he shall be made one, And be with Riches and with Honours Crown'd. Virg. Such generous Offers at the least require, That I with Freedom shou'd disclose my Heart; My Father, Uncle, all my Friends are Patriots, And would disown me, should I Marry one Who has Enslav'd their Country and themselves. App. Ev'n that Impediment I will remove; Swear thou art mine, and Rome this Hour is free, To purchase thee I'll part with dear bought Empire, And am content you should continue Cruel Till you behold the Roman People Rule, And brave Virginius Tribune of the People. Virg. Nay, then I pity thee. App. Speak on! O Musick that Enchants my Soul! Rise one Step higher, pronounce a softer Word. Virg. I never can. App. O yes, you must, you must ev'n now; I adjure you By all that more than Human Grace that flows from you, By the soft God who takes his Pow'r from you, And in your Eyes as in his Heav'n resides, And by the Pow'r of Death from which you sav'd me, O save me not by halves, for still I Dye! Nay more than Dye, for I but Live to Pain, Pain without hope, the Life the Damn'd endure: But tho' the Damn'd ne'r hope, they never Love. In me Desire adds Torment to Despair, But O! a Word, a Smile, a Glance from you Has pow'r to raise me up from more than Death, And turn the more than Hell I feel, to Heav'n. Virg. O Words that might allure a worthier Maid! Oh! Lucius! how thou Triumph'st in my Heart! Yet grant me one thing, and we both are happy. App. Ha! Name it, and tis yours. Virg. As you to Love have Sacrific'd Ambition; Oh Make another yet more noble Sacrifice, And to your Reason, offer up your Love. App. Is that in Appius power? Virg. Not in your pow'r. App. No, can a feeble Mortal resist Heav'n? The Gods, the Gods, ferment this mad Desire. Virg. Make not the Gods the Authors of your Crimes, They gave you reason to subdue your Passions. App. Yes, all but those that from themselves are sent; But they come rushing with resistless fury, While reason to Divinity gives way. I hate my self for this detested Passion; And my Heart bleeds within my Breast for thee, O thou Divinest, and thou best of Maids, And thou most wretched, I could Die to save thee; Yet I, I ruine thee, for I must on; Yes, I am goaded on by Mortal stings. O I am stung to Madness! O Damnnation! All Hell, all Hell, is in my burning Entrails, I'll bear no more, I must, I will have ease. Look down, look down, whatever God thou art, Who driv'st poor Appius on to his sad Fate, Behold ev'n now, thy cruel Will obey'd. Virg. O Heav'n! his sparkling bloody Eyes look wild, Look terrible. Now, now ye Powers assist me. App. Now speak for the last time, will you be mine? Will you, the Daughter of the brave Virginius, To Rome and Glory, Sacrifice your Passion? Virg. You ask me e'n to Sacrifice my Virtue; And that must last when Rome shall be no more. App. If Coy Denial is the Womans virtue, Then vigorous Force must be the manly Lover's, The Virtue of a Heroe and a God: By my great Soul, spight of fantastick Pride, Or more fantastick Love, I will possess thee; Possess thee as our Romulus Hersilia; Or greater Mars did Romulus's Mother: Why shou'd a Monarch shrink from such a deed As was the glorious Fountain of his Empire? Virg. I'll hear no more. App. Here Fulvius take your Slave. Virg. Villain, approach me not. Thus Fate from cruel Fortune sets me free Ah Gods! My Lucius with his Friends appears, [Shout. Now Love and Life for me, and for Thee Tyrant this. [Throws the Dagger at him. App. Ha! He comes indeed, and with a potent Guard; And shall he tear her from me then at last? Oh no! confusion no! Fly, Fulvius, fly, Fly for thy Patron's Life and for thy own, And bring the Cohort quickly to my aid, That now keeps Guard upon the Mount of Jove. Ful. I fly. [Exit. SCENE. V. Enter L. Icilius, M. Icilius, Cornelia, Horatius, Val. P. Num. and C. Num. Guards. Virg. My Lucius! L. Icil. My Soul! Virg. My Life! Oh never, never let us part again! L. Icil. No, only Death shall ever part us more. App. Confusion! How they cleave to one another! How their transported Souls before my Face, Meet at their burning Eyes, their humid Lips; How thirstily he drinks her balmy Breath, As he could quench his Feaver with the draught. Oh the tormenting sight! Ho, Guards divide them. Icil. He who comes near us, comes upon his Death. Curse on your idle Bugbears made for shew; Do you think to frighten Men with empty Scarecrows? No, if thou would'st divide us, come thy self; Compleat the number of thy monstrous Crimes, And find the Vengeance of the Gods in me. App. How dar'st thou thus audaciously to threat The chief of all the Roman Magistrates, Ev'n while the Rods and Axes are in view? L. Icil. Retire, my Life, a while with good Cornelia, [Exeunt Virginia, Cornelia. And at thy Father's House expect me soon. Now, how dar'st thou who art no Magistrate, Thy time of Legal Sway being long expir'd, Threat thy Superiours with the Rods and Axes? App. My Superiours! L. Icil. Yes, every honest Roman's thy Superiour. App. By Hell I'll punish this audacious Insolence. L. Icil. No, sooner dar'st thou leap a precipice, Thou and thy Coward Instruments of Cruelty: Think not to fright us with thy Blustring Pride, For thou art only proud because thou'rt mad: What hast thou to exalt thee but thy Crimes? And Crimes at which a Man endu'd with Reason Would Blush, and hide his Ignominious Head. Yes, thou art Proud because thou art a Tyrant, That is the most Detested thing in Nature: Proud that thou art chosen by the Angry Gods To be the Scourge of Rome, without reflecting, That could those Gods have found one worse than thee, They would have chosen him. Val. To shew that thou wert rais'd by Wrath Divine, The Burning Pestilence foreran thy Sway. Hor. And War and Famine were its dire Attendants. L. Icil. Yet has thy Cruelty been more destructive Than War, Plague, Famine, that in triple League Joyn'd their Confed'rate Horrors; nay, what's worse, While thou hast been a most Indulgent Foe, Witness the Sabines and the Insulting Ãqui, Most Barbarous hast thou been to thy best Friends; First to the Roman People, thy Creators, Whom thou hast vex'd with every vile Oppression, Next to old brave Virginius and to me, At whose request th'Assembled People chose thee: Then to his Daughter, who but the last Night Preserv'd thee tottering on the Brink of Fate, When twenty Souls resolv'd had Vow'd thy Death, And twenty Daggers trembled at thy Heart. App. Ha! for a Knowledge of the Men who bore them? L. Icil. One of them I'll discover to thee instantly, And of the Foremost, and the Boldest one. App. You dare not. L. Icil. Tyrant, I dare, I will. App. His Name? L. Icil. Oh! That his Name were Fatal as his Arm, And with the very Sound could strike thee Dead; Thus would I thunder in thy Ears Icilius. App. Ha! Traytor? L. Icil. He's, He's the Traytor, Who has broke all Trust with Earth, all Oaths with Heaven; And laugh'd at the vain Gods, by which he swore. App. Thou shalt die for it. Val. We'll die with Lucius all. App. Perhaps ye may, perhaps ye all deserve it; Perhaps ye all are guilty equally. All. All, all guilty equally. App. Why then ye all shall die, here seize them Guards. All. Let them come on. Val. Yes, let them come, and the first Man who stirsâ Let's all at once upon the Tyrant rush, And tear his Heart from his accursed Bosom. L. Icil. Let us prevent them, rush upon them all, And kill the Tyrant and his Guards together, And shew our selves the Sons of our brave Fathers: Oh Mutius! where's thy God-like Spirit now? Could'st thou inspir'd by Love for Rome and Glory, Alone attack Porsenna midst his Army? And shall not we, to whom great Jove has given Spirit to assert his own Majestick Cause, Which is the Cause of Liberty and Rome, Dare to assault this Traytor to them both, Defended only by twelve Scarlet Rogues? App. Down, Swelling Heart! Repress thy mighty Rage, Till Fulvius brings the Cohort to thy Aid; And then thou shal't be gorg'd with dire Revenge. By Heaven he comes! with hasty Steps he comes, And with him my Deliverers. Hold, will ye turn base Assassines at last? L. Icil. To Assassinate, belongs to Appius only: Hark how Dentatus Blood cryes out for Vengeance! Since thou hast Banish'd written Law from Rome, We come the Ministers of Natures Law, Th'Executors of Jove's eternal Will; To punish thee a Tyrant and a Murtherer, The Publick Foe of Rome and of Mankind. Val. Let's Sacrifice him strait to great Revenge! Hor. To Rome. C. Num. To Liberty. L. Icil. Vengeance and Death arm every Hand! fall on. All. Fall on, fall on. L. Icil. What's this I see? O Murd'ring disappointment! App. What? do you recoil, and shun the Gods you invoke? Vengeance and Death you see advance to meet you, Vengeance and Death are Ministers of Fate, And 'tis the Frown of Appius that is Fate. Oh! have I calm'd this Tempest of your Souls! Here seize them! Nay, resistance is in vain: A hundred Hands are arm'd against your Lives. Twice in the space of one resolving Sun Ye basely have attempted on my Life, What Mercy then can ye expect or hope? L. Icil. Mercy from Thee! Val. How we disdain the Thought: Hor. What! owe our Lives to Thee! L. Icil. To Jove alone we'll owe them, Jove will protect these Sacred Walls and us. M. Icil. Or will Revenge us, and will Punish thee. The Army is in a full March from Algidum, Eager and Furious to depose thee, Appius, And in two Hours the foremost will be here. App. You think to fright me: Grant that this were true, My Empire still exceeds thy shorter Date, Thou shalt not live an Hour; away with them, And give the Prefect of the Prison charge That all things be got ready for their Deaths; Half of you Guard them to the Prison Gates, The rest to Old Virginia's House must haste, And bring the Slave that's call'd his Daughter hither. [Exeunt all, but Appius and Fulvius Guards. App. I'll go my self, and order four more Cohorts, T'encompass at some distance this Tribunal: For first I will make sure of my Virginia, Then crush these Dogs who have seduc'd the Legion, And rais'd the Spirit of the Clam'rous Croud; Nor leave, till Bleeding Faction Headless lyes, And Groveling and Expiring. My Love I'll satiate, my Revenge I'll cloy; With more than Mortal Pleasure I'll enjoy: And swift as a Revenging God destroy. [Exit. The End of the Fourth ACT.</field>

Roman Spirits in this low Estate, Fearless of Death, as Gods, whom Fate secures, Sure they who have the God-like force of Mind To scorn him thus, alone ought ne'r to feel him: But yet it grieves my Soul that I must leave My Dear Virginia in this dreadful Hour. Yet with a dauntless Brow I'll meet my Fate: But oh! that I could killing Appius Die, At once Triumphing over him and Death; Lucius Icilius would commence Immortal, By such Revenge as Gods are pleas'd to act. But who comes here? who should come here but Death? One of the Tyrant's Instruments of Blood. Ha! Claudius! Enter Claudius. P. N. Claudius! Amazement! How got you admittance? When 'tis the Cruel Tyrant's strict Command, To let no Friends come near us. Claud. The Prefect of this Prison was my Slave, By me first manumitted, then prefer'd To Appius when he first was made Decemvir, Who through a grateful Sense of what he owes me, And on my Oath to stand 'twixt him and Danger, And on his knowledge of the Army's March, Has ventur'd to oblige me. They say the Tyrant Dooms you all to dye, To know the truth of that report I come. P. N. He just has given us notice to prepare for't. Claud. Now by yon Heaven, he's mad as are the Winds, When for the Empire of the Main they strive. L. Icil. Of Life or Death, I have no time t'enquire, For my Virginia takes up all my Soul. Claud. Just now I from the Roman Forum come, Where I have seen a Sight. L. Icil. Speak on! My Soul is rapt in dreadful expectation, And listens to thee, as if Fate were speaking. Claud. Lucius I know thee Manly, Brave, Intrepid, One of Rome's Noblest Offspring: Yet have I seen a Sight, I dare not tell thee, Thou can'st not bear the hearing. L. Icil. By this thou tell'st me much, but yet say on, And I will bear it all with dauntless Courage. Claud. Then hear what I who saw it scarce believe, Against plain Proofs of Reason, nay of Sense; Virginia is adjudg'd a Slave to Fulvius. L. Icil: Ye Furies that have seiz'd my lab'ring Soul Be still but for a moment. Claud. Which Lawless practice when I cou'd not bear, But vehemently and bitterly reprov'd; And with a Spirit all inflam'd, foretold The dismal Consequence. (Oh! all ye Gods! Who cou'd Serenely see th'unnatural Deed.) I by the Tyrant's order straight was dragg'dâ L. I. You? Claud. Yes I, his Unkle, eldest of his House, Was by his order Infamously dragg'd, Both from the Court and Forum. L. I. For which, thou soon wilt see the Villain dragg'd To the opprobrious Rock, and thrown from thence, As one whom Nature and Mankind casts out. Hor. His Cruelty's come home to his own House, And he himself must suffer by it next. L. I. But was Virginius there? Claud. Just then arriv'd: After this base affront to my old Age, The Tyrant now shall take my Life, my Burden: So hearing of the Doom that's past on you, With you to live and dye, resolv'd I come. P. N. We in this place are like to be o'erheard, But yonder's an Apartment of this Prison That's more retir'd, more gloomy, and more dismal, And fit to talk of Fate. [Exeunt.] Lucius Icilius Solus. They're gone! and with them all my tow'ring Pride, And with my Pride my boasted Constancy, And I am now become like vulgar Minds; Oh! I am softer, weaker than a Woman, When I reflect on my Virginia's Wrongs, While I the most undone and lost of Men, Want power to help her in this dire Necessity. Nay, but the following Moment I must dye, And leave her to the Cruel Tyrant's Rage. Leave her to what? Death and eternal Darkness Come seize me straight, and hide me from that thought! Ha! What noise is that? bless me! what dreadful noise? Ah Gods! there Fate is at it's Bloody work, Horatius and Valerius cry aloud, And Marcus now is vehement and high, And Publius too, and Caius! hark! Confusion! Their last expiring Groans are in my Ears. Genius of Rome I come, nor will survive Thy Noblest Sons; do thou, do thou protect My dearest part which I must leave behind, Ye Gods be Guardians to the poor Virginia. [Exit. SCENE Draws. Appius, Virginius, Virginia, Fulvius, Guards discover'd. App. What is not Sentence past? I'll hear no more. Virg. Oh! Appius! I have hitherto had patience, Under what mighty Grief great Jove can tell, But when Injustice rages at its height, Ev'n Gods can bear no more, much less can Mortals. But oh! beware the Fury of a Man Who much and long can bear. App. What is it thou dar'st do? Virg. Go ask the Sabines, Volsci, and the Ãqui; They will with Groans tell what Virginius dares: Or if thou woud'st thy self be an Eye-witness, See where the Foes of Rome, with their rude Hands Have writ my bold Exploits. The Wounds thou see'st upon my mangled Breast, In the defence of Rome I got, to save The spotless Honour of each Roman Daughter; Think'st thou I dare not then defend my own? App. Defend her! where's your power? Virg. Since Right is mine, the Power of Jove is mine; For that's concern'd to vindicate his Justice. App. That shall be quickly try'd, what, Fulvius! Hoa! Virg. Villain stand off! or certain Death attends thee. Appius, if thour't a Man, thou wilt desist, Or mighty Jove, resolv'd on thy destruction, Degrades thee, to prepare thee for thy Fate, And takes his Sacred Image Reason from thee. Therefore thou see'st not that thou tott'ring stand'st Upon a Ghastful Precipice's brink, While Hell beneath thee yawns for thy reception. App. Tho' Hell it self shou'd from the Center burst And blast the Day, I'd not be scar'd from Justice. Virg. From Justice! O Blasphemer! O Impious mock of a most Sacred Name! Hear it ye dreadful Judges of the Damn'd, And in your Adamantine Books record it; That when from the Tarpeian Rock he plunges, To lowest Hell, he may have dismal Justice. [Appius descends from his Tribunal. App. Fulvius, Command the Guards to keep at distance, And let Virginia with respect be treated: Hear me Virginius! thou wer't once my Friend, My lov'd, and valu'd, best, and kindest Friend; Of all our Romans thee I most esteem'd, And I rever'd and lov'd thy God-like Vertue. I see thou art disturb'd, and the just Grief Of one who once was to my Breast so dear, Has touch'd my Soul, obliging me to tell thee, There still is one way left to save thy Daughter. Virg. Name it! App. Persuade her to be mine, by Marriage mine. Virg. Thou know'st she's Contracted to Icilius. App. My Rival's dead! Virg. Dead! App. Icilius and his Brother both are dead, Thy Brother Numitorius and his Son; And those who publick Fools, Horatius and Valerius. Virg. Is't possible? App. I gave my Orders upon pain of Death; And passing by the Prison Gates my self, I heard their dying Groans. Virg. Icilius Murder'd! and must I persuade My Daughter to espouse his Murderer? The Murderer of her Husband, Cousin, Unkle; And those two best and bravest of the Romans, Illustrious Patriots, Horace, and Valerius! If being guilty of such Infamy Wou'd save the World from Ruin, it shou'd perish. App. My time is precious, and brooks no delay, For this last time I leave thee with thy Daughter. Hoa! Fulvius! let your Slave be left a while With her reputed Father: Short is the time allow'd thee, use it well; Either prevail upon her to be mine, Or thou shalt dye; and what thou wilt not grant By boundless Power I'll take. Fulvius! Ful. My Lord! App. If this disdainful Beauty don't comply In half an hour at furthest, let her Father Be hurry'd to his Fate in the same Prison Where the Horatii and the rest expir'd: And bring the Daughter home to thy own House, Aptly adjacent to the Roman Forum; Whither with utmost secrecy I'll go, Attended with two faithful Servants only, My Guards I leave with thee, ho! Guards, attend On Fulvius, and on pain of Death obey him. [Exeunt. Manent Virginius, Virginia. Virg. Ah poor Virginia! we must part Virginia. Vir. You part from your Virginia! And am I not your Daughter then at last? Your dear! your valued! tho' your wretched Daughter: Yes, by th'unequall'd Honour which I bear you, And by that mighty Grief, which kills my Heart Within my Breast, but at the name of parting, I find I am your Daughter. Virg. And let my Grief, and all the dreadful Passions That rend my miserable Heart asunder; Let those assure thee, that I am thy Father. Vir. Then while I live you will not leave me sure; You cannot leave me to the Tyrant's fury; Nay, must not, shall not, still there is a way By which I may avoid it. Virg. There is indeed, and he himself propos'd it, But such a wayâ How much below thy Honour and my own! 'Tis in thy choice, to be the Tyrant's Wife. Vir. No, Lucius, I am faithful still to thee, Tho' thou art absent from thy dying Bride. Virg. Of him, as of thy Lover, think no more. Vir. Not think of him? Virg. He has for ever left us. Vir. He leave us! he! no, he was ever true, And ever kind, and bears a God-like mind; He wou'd not leave the lost Virginia sure. Virg. Thou of Icilius judgest as thou ought'st, No faith, no truth, cou'd ever equal his; But oh! thy tender and thy faithful Lover, The pride and flower of Romans is no more. Vir. Oh Earth and Heaven! my Lucius then is dead. Virg. Ay, murder'd. Vir. Ah murder'd! Virg. Yes, by the most inhumane Tyrant murder'd, The Fate thy Father is to undergo, As soon as e'r he leaves thee. Vir. Ah Gods! my Father too! O horrour! horrour! Lucius is dead, my Father too is dying, And can Virginia live? Virg. What, can thy tender Spirit think of dying? Can'st thou relinquish all the Sweets of Life? Vir. Death has rob'd Life of all that it had sweet, To make himself inviting. Virg. Yes, to preserve thy Vertue pure and spotless, Oh! that a Father shou'd pronounce that doom, Thou darling of my Soul thou need'st must dye. Vir. Then strike, I am prepar'd. Virg. What hast thou said? Is that a Father's office? Thou mak'st a fearful horrible request Which Heaven forbids, and Nature starts to hear. Vir. Law is the Sacred Child of Heaven and Nature, And Roman Law gives Roman Parents power At pleasure to resume that Life they gave. Virg. Yes, to resume it from their wicked Children, Thy Vertue's absolute, as is thy Beauty, And thou, who justly wer't before esteem'd The most Accomplish'd of our Roman Virgins, Hast now discover'd new amazing Vertues: And can thy wretched Father give thee Death? When he admires thee most, when his fond Heart Dissolves with tenderness, and breaks with woe: Not Jove was fonder of his own Creation, When it appear'd so wondrous good and fair. Vir. Vertue and Jove himself cry out aloud to you, To free my Soul, and to secure my Vertue; Since 'tis impossible to live with honour, Th'immortal Gods have summon'd me to dye. Virg. O greatness, worthy Rome, and worthy me! O! Thou'rt the perfect Image of my Soul, And all our Gods as well as I confess thee: Now by yon Heaven my Soul is all on Fire! O! thou hast rouz'd it to Immortal Greatness, And my Breast teems with some prodigious Birth: And thou dread Godâ Whatever God thou art, who command'st Nature, And forcest her to Deeds she most abhors, Assist me with thy dreadful Spirit now; Recoil thou Sun, as at the Feast of Atreus, And hide the World in universal Darkness; That neither Heaven, nor Earth, nor Gods, nor Men, May see a Deed that will amaze the Universe. My Soul! my Soul! oh what art thou about? Strike me with Madness, some propitious Power, That I may lose all thought, and all remembrance, And never know what my curst Hand performs: And thou great Jove, who gav'st me my Virginia, Thy best, thy noblest, thy divinest Gift; Pure as thy Heaven thou sent'st her down to me, Spotless as Heaven receive her now again. And thus in spight of the mad Tyrant's Rage; Oh! thus thy Father vindicates thy Freedom, And thus secures thy Vertue; Tyrant, Tyrant, Thus with the sprinkling of this sacred Blood, I consecrate thee to the Infernal Powers. Vir. I'm Free; And Rome that will it's Freedom owe to me, Upon the Wings of her victorious Eagles Shall through all Times and Places bear my Vertue: I die a Roman now, and die your Daughter, And worthy of Icilius who expects me. [Dies. Virg. Tell him that soon he may expect thy Father; Or rather tell him I expect him here; Bid him arise, and bring Revenge to day From it's Infernal Mansion. Enter Fulvius. Ful. What hast thou done? So black a Deed not Hell it self e'er saw. Virg. Then Villain hye to Hell, and tell the damn'd [Kills him. Here's one on Earth that has outdone them all: And now the amazing Vengeance is begun, And now the Regions of pale Ghosts are mov'd; I hear, I hear, th'Infernal Thunder roar, And dire Revenge the dreadful Larum takes; And with a baleful Equipage ascends, A thousand bleeding Ghosts by Appius murder'd, And at their Head th'invincible Dentatus, Valerius, Horace, and the Numitorii; But above all the fierce Icilius rages, And breaths Destruction to the bloody Appius. Ha! Either reason now gives place to madness, Or I in very deed behold him yonder; O Heaven and Earth! 'tis he, 'tis he himself, And I grow stiff with horror and amazement. Enter Attendants, L. Icilius. L. Icil. Here are the Villains, Bloodhounds, seize them all. My Father! Virg. Art thou Icilius? L. Icil. Where is Virginia? Is she safe from Appius? Virg. She is safe from Appius's power. L. Icil. Where is the Tyrant? Virg. Each moment I expect him. L. Icil. But why this grief? this horror! this amazement! Virg. They told me thou wert murder'd, Thou and the rest of our Illustrious Friends. L. Icil. Why yes, the Tyrant had design'd it well. Virg. Nay Appius says he heard their dying groans. L. Icil. I thought my self I heard the rest expiring, As in the next Apartment of the Prison, I was lamenting my Virginia's danger; But flying to their aid, I quickly found Their murderers were dying, and not they. The PrÃ¦fect of the Prison gain'd by Claudius, Had given them Weapons; and I found 'em fighting, With that Success that nought was left for me. But can Virginius hear of our deliverance And yet retain his Grief, when his Friends safety Is follow'd by the Liberty of Rome. Virg. The Liberty of Rome? L. Icil. The everlasting Liberty of Rome! Horatius and Valerius have conven'd The Senate, who in full Assembly Vote, The Abolition of the curst Decemvirate. Your Brother Numitorius and his Son Have part by Promises, and part by Threats, Prevail'd upon the Forces left at Rome To abandon Appius; and my Brother Marcus Joyns the tempestuous Legions from FidenÃ¦, That now ere entring Rome with furious March To joyn the other Army. I have Assembled here the raging People To rescue my Virginia from her danger, And crush the Impious Tyrant. Virg. O! wou'd th'avenging Thunderbolt of Jove Fall down amain on this devoted Head, And drive me headlong to th'Infernal Powers. L. Icil. Ha! Why these starts? this horror, and this trembling! Where is Virginia? Virg. My Lucius! be advis'd by one who loves thee, Fate has made thee the God-like Instrument Of raising up thy Country from a State Of wretchedness to Liberty and Glory. Let Rome and Glory be henceforth thy Mistress, And never think of thy Virginia more. L. Icil. Damnation! There has mighty mischief happen'd, And I can bear no more; where is Virginia? Virg. Art thou prepar'd to taste Infernal Horrors? L. Icil. Even for the worst of Fates I am prepar'd. Virg. If you dar'st see a sight will blast thy Eyes, Look there, and see where poor Virginia was. L. Icil. Hah! where she was indeed, Ay! here's the dreadful Thunderbolt of Fate, That drives the lost Icilius to the Grave. She's gone, for ever gone, the King of Terrors Lays his rude Hand upon her lovely Limbs, And blasts her Beauties with his Icy Breath. The cruel Gods but let her just appear; Just sent her down from Heaven to shew the Earth There are Diviner forms, more perfect Beauties, Than we frail Mortals use t'admire below; Then greedily they snatch'd her to themselves, As too Divine to be enjoy'd by Man. Virg. Oh Lucius! Lucius! L. Icil. Oh my Father! But for one Hour I will have Truce with woe, And Vengeance in my Soul shall take its room. Virg. Wilt thou Revenge her? L. Icil. Will I revenge her? yes, at such a rate, That even the World's last Age shall hear and Tremble. Where is the Wretch who did the dreadful Deed? Virg. Then Swear as soon as ee'r he's in thy power Thou'lt strike thy Dagger to his Impious Heart. L. Icil. Then by the Soul of that departed Dear one, Who hov'ring in the mournful Air attends me, I Swear that I, that only I will kill him: As I could bear no Rival in my Love, So no one in the dear Revenge shall share. Virg. Then strike! L. Icil. Ha! where? Virg. Here. L. Icil. What hast thou said? O wretched, wretched Man! Disastrous Beauty! execrable Tyrant! And Oh! the woful Father's dire necessity! Virg. Why dost thou stand Tormenting a lost Wretch? Why hast thou not already pierc'd my Heart? L. Icil. No, You held the Dagger, Appius struck the blow, And he's the Visitant that Hell expects. Where is the Tyrant? Virg. At Fulvius's House that Borders on this Forum, To which he privately retir'd, to which He order'd that dead Dog to bring Virginia; Unless she wou'd consent to be his Wife. L. Icil. Damn'd, Damn'd Villain! Virg. I who was near him overheard that Order, Which urg'd Virginia's miserable Fate. L. Icil. Then he is wholly ignorant of her Death. Virg. He yet can nothing know of what has past. L. Icil. Now by th'Avenging Furies here he comes. Virg. Attended as he went by only two; Let us dispatch him instantly. L. Icil. No, hold! Respect the Oath I've taken, and Retire. Virg. Farewel! th'accurst Virginius will retire, But to the place from whence there's no return; My poor Virginia was the only tye That held me fast to Life; but she is gone, And pulls her Father after her. [Exit. L. I. To some small distance you my Friends withdraw, For I wou'd take the Villain in his height; Yes, in the height of his presumptuous Pride, And in the foam of all his blustering Rage. And when he's most secure, and highest soars, Than dash him from his Mountains heap'd on Mountains, And from his affectation of Divinity, Down, down, to the Abyss; but dash him so That he may feel the blow, and Dye blaspheming: Humble his Pride, extinguish his mad rage, And kill the Tyrant first, and then the Man. Enter Appius. L. I. So the base Murderer starts when he beholds The fearful Spectre of the Man he Murder'd. App. Perdition light upon thee! is it thou? Know that I started out of Hate, not Fear, As from an odious thing that shocks my Nature. L. I. Yes, by a sure Presage, because she knows That I am sent by Fate for her Destruction. But e'er thou dy'st, I'll make thee feel thy Death; Which that thou may'st, I'll shew thee here a Sight, That will at once astonish thee, and grieve thee: [Shews him Fulvius. Behold one Murder done without thy knowledge! App. Hast thou done this? and hop'st t'escape unpunish'd? L. I. Has this provok'd thee? See then another that will make thee rave, [Shews him Virginia. And howl and tear thy very Flesh for rage. App. May Lightning blast thee, thou hast basely done this, Because thou had'st no other way to rend her from me. But by th'immortal, boundless Love I bore her, I will revenge her, and her Murderer dies. L. I. Thou rav'st, Thy Instruments of Mischief all have left thee. App. No matter, thou and all the World shall see, Appius to kill thee, wants no help but Appius. L. I. Now thou shalt see what help Icilius needs, And what a hideous change one Hour has made In thy most abject Fortunes; thou art lost, While thou wer't brooding o'er thy Bestial Lust, And shunning like a Bird obscene the Day. The Legions of both Armies have deserted thee, The Senate have declar'd thy Empire void, Thy own Flagitious Troops have left thee Naked; Left thee their Scorn and utter Detestation. The People raging like the Stormy Main, Aloud for thy immediate Ruin roar. See where in waving Crouds they all surround thee, And at the smallest Signal that I give, Will like an Inundation pour upon thee. But yet because 'twill please Virginia's Ghost, That thou shoud'st Dye by her Icilius hand, And I have Sworn that only I will Kill thee, To Single Mortal Combat I defie thee. Yes, I will kill thy Pride before thy Person; And thou shalt dye Convicted, thour't so far From being worthy to Command the Romans, That thou'rt not equal to the meanest Roman: No, I, the meanest of the Sons of Rome, Have Power from Nature and from Fate above thee; Have Power to take thy Life and Empire from thee. App. Back in thy Face I throw thy bold defiance, Firmly resolv'd to Kill thee or to Dye: Know next my Ardor to possess Virginia, My eager'st wish has been to Cope with thee: And let unequal Gods and partial Fortune, Dispose of my uncertain Life and Empire As it seems good to them; I'll make them know Th'Immortal Greatness of my Mind's my own. If I do fall by thy most hateful Hand, I'll fall like Appius still, with such a Look, With such a Voice, with such a dauntless Mind, That Gods and Men, and thou thy self shalt own, Spite of thy Malice, I was Born for Empire; And that the Man who dar'd like me to Die, Deserv'd to live to Lord it over thee, And over all the Romans. L. I. This is the Language of thy Pride thy Frenzy, But Bleeding soon will bring thee to thy self. Thou hov'ring Soul of my ador'd Virginia, And thou Immortal Liberty look down, Behold the dreadful Vengeance that I take. App. Thy Deities are absent, mine are here, My vast Ambition and my own Right Hand, The only Gods that Appius will invoke. L. I. Then perish Appius, and his Gods together. [Fight, Appius falls. Now where's thy Pride, thy Rage, and thy Presumption? Now where's the Look, the Voice, the dauntless Mind, That Gods and Men should say deserv'd an Empire? They're gone, and in their Doom is dismal Horror, Trouble, Despair, Distraction and Amazement! That hideous Mein that's fit to welcome Hell, That passes its Eternal Bounds to meet thee. Be gone thou Loyterer, dispatch, descend, Take that for brave Dentatus, that for Rome; And this, and this, for my most wrong'd Virginia. Ah! in that Groan he comes, Immortal Radamanthus The Tyrant comes, prepare him a reception Which Hell nee'r saw before: Attend ye Furies, Attend ye Screaming Ghosts of Murder'd Romans; Behold! your Judge now Sentenc'd in his Turn, And doom'd to Pains at which the Damn'd will tremble, And take their own for Joys. Enter M. Icilius. M. I. My Brother! L. I. Oh Marcus! Oh my Brother! Thou art a Stranger to what Fate has done. M. I. No, as I came, I met the raving Father, Who in three Words has told a sadder Tale, Than all the long Records of time can parallel. Which made me Fly on all the Wings of Fear, Lest Grief might hurry thee to something Fatal, Below the greatness of thy Mind and Name. L. I. No Marcus, no my Brother, The greatness of my Love and of my Grief, Not by unmanly Moan or black Despair, But by unparallel'd Revenge I'll shew, Look there. M. I. The Tyrant here extended at his length, And Slain by thee! It was a God-like Act. L. I. That's not enough, for all the Ten must Bleed, And all their chief Accomplices must fall. M. I. Come to Mount Aventine, and thou shalt see Revenge in all her Pomp, and all her Fury, Where she impatiently expects thee Lucius. For there the People and the Legions mingled, Shew the delighted and the wond'ring Gods, A Spirit worthy of that chosen Nation, Predestin'd under them to rule the World: And great Revenge and Liberty is now Their Universal Cry. Just as I left them, Horatius and Valerius were arriv'd, Who from the Senate brought them the full Grant Of all their Ancient Rights, their lov'd Appeal, And power to chuse their Tribunes as before; On which, thou Lucius first of all wer't nam'd, The Father of Virginia next was mention'd, And both with Universal Shout applauded. L. I. Suspend we then a while these Traytors Doom, Till we restore the Ancient Rights of Rome: Then shall Just Vengeance strike the World with awe, And make Mankind respect CÅlestial Law, Which he who breaks, like Appius runs so long, From less Injustice to more crying Wrong That some intollerable Crime at last, Pulls halting Vengeance down for all that's past. [Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
