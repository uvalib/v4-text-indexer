      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —Palace of King Block. King seated on his Throne—Ambassador from the King of the Happy Islands—Courtiers, Guards, &amp;c., discovered. Air and Chorus—Ambassador and Suite—“Old King Cole.” Old King Cole was a merry old soul, And a merry old soul was he; 'Till he lost his only daughter, Who was taken on the water, And drowned in her infancy. Ever since then, The saddest of men Has our Sovereign been to see; And trickle, trickle, trickle, Fall the tears salt as pickle, When he thinks on his pickaninny. Old King Cole, he scratched his bald poll, And he said to himself, says he, “There's my brother King Block, Has of boys a fine stock, And my heir one of them shall be.” So he called for his sceptre, And he called for his crown, And he called for his counsellors three, And they settled that the choice Should depend upon the voice Of your Gracious Majesty. Old King Cole was a merry, &amp;c. King. My lord Ambassador, since left to me My choice is quickly made, Sons I have three. The eldest born, of course, is heir to my lands; The next shall rule over your Happy Islands; The third is still a child, so, usher, run, Call forth Prince Amiable, our second son. (Exit Usher) Amb. Most mighty King, by what rule have you reckon'd? Why call you fourth the son who is your second? King. I call him forth because he is to go forth As Crown Prince of the Happy Isles, and so forth! Enter Prince Amiable—King comes down. Come hither, son; your uncle has no heir. Prince. Then let us send him, sir, a wig to wear. King. Ingenuous youth! he doesn't want a wig, But from our royal tree he craves a twig, To graft upon his own more ancient stock. Prince. That is, he wants a chip of the old block. King. Precocious boy—he does—his infant daughter Was drown'd, you may remember. Amb. In the water. Prince. I guessed as much—on land it scarce could be. King. Her wet nurse took the poor babe out to sea In a small sailing-boat—a squall upset her— Prince. The child's squall? Amb. No, sir! the wet nurse— Prince. Proved wetter Than she had bargained for. King. The issue sad— Prince. The King lost all the issue that he had. King. His heir presumptive left to my election, I have named you. Prince. I've not the least objection. Amb. and Suite. Long live Prince Amiable! Prince. (bowing) And you to see it! King. You must embark immediately. Prince. So be it. To sail upon the instant, sir, I'm ready. And so your blessing. King. Take it, boy. Be steady, I've nothing more to give you—but my prayers, Unless you fancy a few railway shares. Prince. Sir, to your blessing would you add a curse? King. Nay, some may yet put money in one's purse, Here are 500, “Fairy-land direct,” They'll soon be at a premium, I expect, For every manager, who'd cut a shine, Has turned a speculator in this line. Prince. To rob you of them I should think a crime— One Railway King's enough, sir, at a time. An allusion to the Mr. Hudson who obtained that name from his vast operations in railways. —See Preface. (To Ambassador) Is that your barge I in the offing see? Amb. It is! Prince. Her name? Amb. The “Bee and Orange Tree.” Built by the Countess D'Aulnoy—an old ship, But newly rigged, expressly for this trip. Prince. Then farewell, father—to yourself and Court, And fortune send us all safe into port. Air and Chorus—“The College Hornpipe.” Come, pipe all hands, then aboard the ship, Her sails are bent and her anchor a-trip; We'll serve every man with a double share of flip, And be off before you well can say “Jack Robinson.” Prince. Don't you let my cousin's fate occur to me, I've not the slightest wish to be drowned at sea! So here's success to the “Bee and Orange Tree,” And send us safe ashore, like Jack Robinson. Chorus. Come, pipe all hands. (Exeunt opposite sides King, Guards and Court and Prince, with Ambassador and Suite)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. —The Sea Shore with Cavern—Tempest—A vessel is seen in distress—When it is out of sight, enter from Cavern, Princess Amy; she is dressed in a tiger's skin, her arms and legs bare, sandals on her feet, her hair flowing down her shoulders and surmounted by a fillet of sea weed and coral; a quiver with arrows at her back, and a bow in her hand. Air—Amy—“By the sad sea waves.” By the sad sea waves I listen while they moan, And lament I've but this bow to call my own: I am young, I am fair, I'm of that quite aware, But there's not a single man to make me “bone of his bone.” I'm a fierce Ogre's slave, By the sad sea wave, And an old maid soon I feel I shall be grown! In my dreams last night, by downy sleep beguiled, In the fair dream light, a youth upon me smiled. His eyes they were blue, And he said “How d'ye do?” In a tone just as if he had known me from a child. Oh, I wish I could see Such a nice young man as he! Come again, dear sir! and with joy I shall go wild! Amy. 'Twas but a dream—but dreams sometimes come true, And this storm might cast up a man or two, One such as smiled on me in that sweet nap, Were quite sufficient—such a handsome chap. I, who ne'er saw but Ogres, fierce and frightful, Could scarce imagine creature so delightful. And shall I ne'er again that form behold, But as a maid of all work here grow old! Against my will, O must I wear the willow? O mercy! what's that floating on the billow? Something alive and swimming—can it be? A fish! a bird! a beast? or all the three? Some huge sea monster! It has arms and legs! Oh, Fortune! yes—as sure as eggs are eggs! A suit of clothes! and a man in 'em too! (Prince Amiable is cast ashore by the waves) The being of my dream! (Prince comes down) Prince. (looking at her) Ha! How d'ye do? Amy. The words! the tone! the look—the eyes—the hair! Prince. A very fine young woman, I declare! Air distingué! and costumed à ravir, En femme sauvage—don't be afraid, my dear, But to one question give me answer true. Pray, has your mother any more of you? Amy. If you please, sir, I never had a mother. Prince. Nor father? Amy. No, sir. Prince. Neither one nor t'other! An interesting fact in natural history, Which clears up what to me was quite a mystery. I've seen so many people in high stations Who came of nobody—had no relations— At least that they would own—and never knew, Until this moment, how or where they grew. Permit me to prolong the conversation, By asking your baptismal appellation? Amy. Sir? Prince. Tho' not born, of course you have been christen'd? Amy. Not that I know of, sir. Prince. I never listened To any tale more singularly wild. So you'd not e'en a godmother? poor child! Perhaps, then, you've no name? Amy. They call me slave. Prince. They—who? Amy. The owners of that dreary cave. Prince. Ah! Then you have “a local habitation?” And who may own this charming excavation? Amy. A wicked Ogre, and his wife as cruel, For whom I make the beds, and fetch in fuel. Prince. An Ogre!—what!—a cannibal accurst! My good girl, why not mention this at first? I wish you, most respectfully—good-bye— Amy. Stir not, for mercy's sake—where would you fly? Prince. I'm not at all particular, provided, It's out of reach of monsters so decided! Amy. You rush but to your fate—bewitching stranger, Stay here, and I will shelter you from danger! I'll hide you where the Ogres shall not find, And do for you myself— Prince. You're very kind— But room still further on I may find one for, Where young men are not taken in and done for! Amy. You cannot on this coast— Prince. I own the case Would be a rare one at a watering place; But I prefer to seek for other lodgings. Amy. None would conceal you from their artful dodgings! Oh, trust to me! your confidence I'd win! I've nothing of the tiger but the skin! Master and mistress are both out— Prince. Thank heaven! Amy. And won't be home again till half-past seven, To dinner. Prince. Dinner! Then they'll dine on me. Amy. I will be dished myself ere that shall be. Prince. Sweet aboriginal! Amy. Pray walk indoors. They're gone for a day's sport upon the moors. Prince. Grouse shooting? Amy. No! Prince. What other game is found there? Amy. Railway surveyors—just now, they abound there. Master, I'm told, caught six last week at least. Prince. And ate them— Amy. On the spot. Prince. The nasty beast! Amy. But come—for you I'll find more fitting food, What say you to a parrot nicely stewed? Or a baked squirrel, with sweet sauce? Prince. Most vile! Have you no shell-fish? Amy. There's a crocodile, In famous cut—but cold. Now I remember, We pickled some fine monkeys last November, And there must yet be left some nine or ten. Master eats monkeys, when he can't catch men! Prince. I'd sooner starve than rob him of a bit! But do you down to pickled monkeys sit? Amy. Oh no—I give him all the game I shoot, I live upon spring water and wild fruit, Chestnuts and blackberries. Prince. Much better fare! Amy. All that I have with you I'll freely share, So you will love the poor unfriended slave. Prince. Love you! By what's most beautiful and brave— And that's myself—I'll love you to distraction, And wed you, if that's any satisfaction. Air—Prince—“Oh, smile as thou wert wont to smile.” You smile as girls are wont to smile When men propose in joke, But I was serious all the while, And meant just what I spoke. You've led till now a dismal life, And Fortune's in your debt; But if you live to be my wife, You may be happy yet. 'Tis true we're rather in a scrape, And from the Ogre's den There seems no prospect of escape, Or getting home again. But something may at last turn up, To free us from his net; And if on us he should not sup, We may be happy yet. Amy. Oh joy! a sweeter spouse could fate allot one? But I can't change my name for I've not got one. Prince. You shall take mine—a Prince's. Amy. Goodness gracious! Then I shall be a Princess! That's splendacious! Prince. Lo, with this ring my troth to thee I plight— (puts a ring on her finger) Amy. I mine, with this— (takes a chain from her neck, to which is appended a turquoise with characters engraven on it) Prince. How! may I trust my sight! What means this trinket—quickly, love, explain? Amy. It is a turquoise hanging by a chain. Prince. But thereby hangs a tale as well, no doubt. Amy. A tale? Prince. Will tell us where you first hung out. For here some written characters I trace. Amy. A character I had from my last place. Prince. Look on these letters— Amy. Vainly should I look, For I don't know my letters in a book. Prince. Not read a word? Amy. Upon my word I can't. Prince. You had a mother! you came of my aunt! Amy. Your aunt! Prince. 'Tis she! Amy. Me! Prince. You! Amy. Who? Prince. Bless my soul! The Princess Amy—daughter of King Cole. (embrace) Amy. A Princess! Prince. In your own right! Amy. Can it be! Prince. My little cousin who was drowned at sea! Duet—Prince and Amy—“What fairy-like music.” Amy. How very like music his words seem to me, By such a sweet cousin I can't cozened be; 'Twas the voice sure of nature, that thrilled through each vein, When he said “How d'ye do?” in that exquisite strain. Prince. 'Tis very like you, love, came over the sea, With the same smile by which you so came over me; A distant relation you must not remain, To my uncle we'll go and be both pledged again. Amy. The family's out, so pray walk in and rest There is no one below but the cat, I protest, I'll lodge you and board you in yonder rude cave, But as I'm alone, sir, I hope you'll behave. Prince. The family's out, so I'll walk in and rest And have only to hope I'm for dinner not drest; When I think of the Ogre who owns this rude cave, I feel if once smoked I my bacon can't save. Together.

      <field name="fulltext">Scene Third. —Gorge near the Ogre's Cave. Enter Ravagio. Air—Ravagio—“I am a Friar of Orders Grey.” I am an Ogre I beg to say, And gobble up any one in my way. I pluck not blackberry, hip or haw, With fat little babbies I fill my craw; On young folks though I prefer to sup, I don't object to them when grown up; And why I'm so plump the reason I'll tell, Who lives on his neighbours is sure to live well. What sharper, or swindler, or usuring Jew, But lives much the same as the Ogres do. As the O—O—O, &amp;c. He who plunders the orphan child, Mightn't he just as well eat him broiled? He who robs his neighbour of bread, Had better have swallowed him whole instead. The sempstress wasted by slow decay, Has her bones but picked in another way; To the weary weaver with sleep o'ercome, The factory bell sounds like “Fee Fo Fum.” How many who swagger this wide world through Might just as well be called Ogres too! Be called O—O—O, &amp;c. Rav. Yes, I maintain, Ogres are less to blame Than many persons I decline to name. To eat up man and wife is far less cruel Than let 'em starve apart on water gruel! And better swallow infants, fast as pills, Then grind their bones to dust in cotton mills. And when we think of surplus population, An Ogre's quite a blessing to a nation! Talking of wives and children—where's my wife And hopeful son?—a fine boy, 'pon my life, And soon shall have a wife himself—what ho! Dame Tourmentine! Enter Tourmentine. Tour. I come, Ravagio! Rav. Where's Croquemitain? still lingering on the heights? Enter Croquemitain, carrying a quantity of surveying instruments, books, &amp;c. Cro. No, pa, here—laden with theodolites, Rods, chains, books, maps, and plans for deposition! Rav. The owners were in capital condition! I haven't made so good a meal for years. We've eaten—let me see—four engineers, And ten surveyors—not to mention clerks. We shall get fat upon these railroad sparks. Why, since the panic broke out in the City, We've ate a whole provisional committee! Tour. The chairman was particularly tough, And yet I'm sure I roasted him enough. Rav. My dear, he was a very old offender, And there's no roasting makes those fellows tender. Come, let's to sleep—we want no more to-night, It's best to leave off with an appetite. Trio—Ravagio, Tourmentine, and Croquemitain—“Say what shall be our sport to-day?”—“Moore's National Melodies.” With what has been our food to-day, There's nothing on earth can sure compare; So light, so white—so recherché— For Ogres the very fare! But though I have filled my crop, And am anything but sharp-set, On a nice tit-bit if I could pop, I've a corner for that left yet. (Exeunt)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fourth. —The Ogre's only Servant's Hall—Cellar door at back—Prince and Amy discovered seated beside the fire. Amy. Another chestnut, love? Prince. No,—not one more, I had a wet, before I came ashore; Since then my appetite has fast been fleeting; I think of being eaten, more than eating! Amy. Fear nothing; in yon cellar you shall sleep, The firewood there 'neath lock and key I keep, And when the family a hunting fare, I'll let you out, to take a little air! Prince. A pleasant future fate for me has hoarded, In a wood cellar to be lodged and boarded. Oh! what an endless source of quips and quillets, A soldier billeted upon the billets! A lover seeking out the softest too, That he may sleep upon a billet doux! A sailor, whom from drowning, Fortune snatches, To keep a log for ever under hatches. No! sooner than among these faggots fix, Let us at once resolve to cut our sticks! Amy. There's no escaping from these horrid brutes— Ravagio has a pair of seven-leagued boots, He'd soon look over both our naked noses; That's why the railroad here he so opposes; For, if on hear-say I may place reliance, The shoes of swiftness now are worn by science; And once the march of intellect beginning, No seven-leagued boots will have a chance of winning. Prince. Hence, babbling fears! begone, ye base alarms! Since legs cannot befriend us, let's try arms! Have you no weapons but your bow and arrows— Will they shoot nothing except apes and sparrows? The Ogres slain, our lives are both secured! Amy. You can't kill them—their lives are all ensured; From mortal weapons they have nought to fear. Prince. You make me feel particularly queer; On what a dreadful coast has fortune toss'd us. Rav. (without) Slave! Amy. Master's voice! Prince. The Devil and Dr. Faustus! Amy. Into the cellar, quick! Prince. One moment, dear. Are you quite sure you've no black beetles here? Amy. How can you stop to ask at such a minute? Prince. Well, if there's one—by Jove! I can't stay in it! Amy. (pushing him into cellar and locking door) But just in time! They're both coming downstairs. I'm so alarm'd—I feel at my last prayers! Enter Ravagio and Tourmentine. Rav. Why, how now, slave? didn't you hear me call? Amy. Call, sir? Rav. Aye, girl,—as loud as I could bawl. Were you asleep? Amy. (aside) A good excuse. (aloud) Methinks I was indeed just taking forty winks. Rav. Well, well—no matter—we're not angry, child. Amy. (aside) Child! sure the monster's growing monstrous mild. What's in the wind? it bodes no good, I fear. Rav. Your mistress wants to speak to you, my dear. Tour. Come hither, wench—you know the obligation You're under to us for your preservation? Amy. Yes, madam, and with gratitude I view it; You might have ate me, and you didn't do it. Tour. I don't allude to that—for then in truth, You were so small—you'd not have filled a tooth Put out to sea—by whom is still a query— The waves had rocked your cradle, till quite weary They left it on the rock—whence, to speak freely, We brought it down, and brought you up genteelly. As you grew older, plump as any chicken, We often fancied you'd be pretty picking; But conscientiously forebore to cook you, And only into our own service took you. But now you are a woman grown— Amy. Oh dear! You wouldn't eat me now? Rav. No, no, don't fear— We wish to see you settled well in life, And mean to make you of our son the wife. Amy. The wife of Croquemitain! O! rather make me Into a pie, and for your dinner bake me! Or living, tear my tender limbs asunder— Rav. Odds!—blood and bones!—what's here to do, I wonder? Rebellious baggage, are you drunk or mad? Tour. Reject my pretty Croky— Rav. Come here, lad! (Enter Croquemitain with surveying instruments, &amp;c.) D'ye see that girl? Cro. Yes; she's a lovely cretur'! Rav. Say, would you rather marry her, or eat her? Cro. Oh, marry her, by all means, pa, I say; Then I can eat her, you know, any day— Amy. (aside) The little monster! Rav. Ha, ha! so you can. That's what it is to be an Ogre, man! (to Amy) So settle your fine joints—for by my fay, To-morrow, minx, shall be your wedding day! Amy. (aside) Oh, never shall the sun that morrow see! Cro. Sweet wife that is to be, give me the key Of yonder cave—I'll stow this stuff away. Amy. The key! (aside) O crimini!—what shall I say? (aloud) The key—I know not—somewhere on the shelf; I'll stow the things away—to-night, myself. Rav. Aye, aye, 'tis late—to bed—to bed, boy—come. Cro. Stop! father! mother!— Tour. Wherefore? Cro. (sniffing) Fee! Fo! Fum! Rav. Why, Croquemitain, what are you doing there? Cro. I smell fresh meat! Rav. The deuce you do, lad! where? Cro. In the wood cellar! (a noise of logs falling) Tour. Hark! what noise was that? Rav. Something knocked something down! Amy. 'Tis but the cat! Tour. The cat! don't tell me, that's the old resource, Whatever happens, 'tis the cat of course. The key! ha! here it is— (snatches it from Amy's girdle, unlocks door, and enters cellar) Amy. (aside) Malicious hag! I see she'll let the cat out of the bag. Tour. (within) Here! help! I've caught the cat— Croquemitain runs into cellar, and re-enters with Tourmentine, dragging in the Prince) Cro. A tom cat, see! Rav. A bouncer, too! Prince. (aside) Here's a catastrophe! Amy. (aside) My budding hopes are torn up by the roots! Rav. So I perceive, sir—you are Puss in Boots! Tour. What business have you in my servant's hall? Prince. I feel, ma'am, I've no business here at all! Rav. Are you an engineer, or a surveyor? Tour. A chimney-sweeper, or a strolling player? Rav. An area sneak, my larder who'd invade? Tour. Or a policeman come to court the maid? Prince. Briefly, good friends, I'm neither one nor t'other, But simply a poor Prince— Cro. A Prince! O mother! Prince. By a huge wave, whilst upon deck he dangled, Washed overboard to be—rough-dried and mangled! Rav. A Prince! a dish fit for a king! why, wife! I never ate a prince in all my life! Jugged, he would make delicious food, I warrant, Only imagine a jugged heir apparent! Tour. Poh! you might like a peasant far the best, So much depends on how a man is drest! Cro. Papa! let's keep him for my wedding dinner! Prince. (aside) I'll choke 'em every one as I'm a sinner! Rav. Good! in the safe to-night he must be shut up. Prince. I feel already most completely cut up! O, great King Block, my sire! good afternoon; Your chip will be a chip in porridge soon! Concerted Piece. Quartette—Prince, Amy, Ravagio, and Croquemitain—“If true his tale”—“Daughter of St. Mark.” Rav., Cro. Pay to his/my tale attention all In love with servant maids who fall; Prince. Of area steps the safety doubt, And don't walk in though “Master's out.” Amy. Pay to my tale attention all Ye servant maids in love who fall; Don't bring young men the house about, But wait till it's your Sunday out. (they put him into cellar again) Rav. Go to bed, wife, and you too, boy. I'll stay, And watch beside the fire till break o' day. Tour. Aye, husband, do—and mind the fire you keep in, (to Amy) Slave! where are the gold crowns we always sleep in? Amy. Upon your pillows, ready for your heads; I put them there when I turned down the beds. Tour. (to Croquemitain) So, good night, darling. (Exit Tourmentine) Cro. Good night—and d'ye hear, “If you're waking, call me early, call me early, mother dear.” (Exit Croquemitain) Rav. (to Amy) You begone, too! stop—reach me down my book. Amy. This, sir? Rav. Yes—(reads title) “Every Ogre his own cook.” Full of receipts for hashes—roasts—and minces; I want to see what's the best sauce for princes. Amy. (aside) To set my lover free, I'll rack my brains! (Exit Amy) Rav. Here's a rare dish—“An alderman in chains!” (reads) “Take a fat alderman, not past the chair, They're not so tender when they've once been Mayor; Stuff him with turtle well below the waist, And garnish him with gold chain to your taste, Then let him stand in Guildhall till he's cool” What next? Oh, “How to make fine gooseberry fool!” “Take a green-horn, whom fortune has heaped cash on, And mix him with the cream of London fashion, Stir him well round till drained of every penny, And he will make as good a fool as any!” “Scotch Collops”—something very economical— “First catch your Scotchman,”—humph! that's rather comical; The way's to take him as he comes—'tis plain— You'll never catch him going back again. Re-enter Amy, unseen by Ravagio. Amy. (aside) I have bethought me of a little wand Which mistress prizes all things else beyond, And fingers on it have contrived to lay; It was a fairy's once I've heard her say. The Fairy Trufio! ah! that's the name Of the great personage from whom it came; But how to use it, hang me if I know!— O potent Fairy! mighty Trufio! I wish that brute were fast asleep, (music) that I The virtue of thy magic stick might try! Rav. Holloa! my eyes I can scarce open keep; Reading by firelight draws one so to sleep! (drops books and falls asleep) Amy. Bless me! he is asleep! how very odd! Why this must surely be a wishing rod— Oh, if it should! ye gods and little fishes! Think of a woman getting all her wishes! I'll wish again—heyday! the stick is shorter Than it appeared before—by a full quarter! Prudence! if my desires do not keep slow time, I shall wish all my stick away, in no time! Of my first wish, first, let me make the most. (opens door of cellar) Where are you, love? Prince. (bound to a log of wood) Here, fastened to a post. Amy. (releases him) Let us post hence—for, betwixt you and me, And that post, I've a secret for you—see! Prince. The Ogre fast asleep! but flight is fruitless, His seven-leagued boots will make our efforts bootless. Amy. They would, but for this charming little wishing rod. Prince. I took it for a portion of a fishing rod. How can this help us? (examining it) Amy. Whatsoe'er you lack, Wish for it, and you'll have it in a crack. Prince. Indeed! then wherefore stay to make a doubt of it In this black hole—I wish that we were out of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. —Suddenly changes to Summit of a Mountain. And so we are, by Jupiter! but where? Amy. Too rashly wish'd, behold! (points to stick, which has again shortened) Prince. Well, I declare! Some one has cut our stick, as well as we! Stay, an inscription on it here I see. (reads) “Mortal, you've had two wishes out of four; Take notice, you can only have two more.” Astounding fact! whoe'er is the magician? Like Cassio, he's a great arithmetician! Take two from four and only two remain! But I've had only one wish, I maintain. Amy. Alas! I had the first, and little reckoned That you so suddenly would form a second. Out of the cave 'tis very true we are, But 'tis impossible to say how far. Tho' seven long leagues divide us from our foe, He'd overtake us in one stride, you know! Prince. You're too correct—my wish was made in haste, Not knowing that we hadn't one to waste. What's to be done? In such a strange quandary, It certainly behoves us to be wary. You hold the wand, and watch whilst I suggest All sorts of wishes, and then choose the best. (gives her the wand) The best perhaps in our situation, Would be to wish this were a railway station, The tickets taken, and the bell a ringing, In the first carriage but just time for springing. I never thought to patronise “the Rail,” But need must, when an Ogre's at your tail! Song—Prince—“Hurrah for the road!” Hurrah! the old slow coach is gone! Hurrah! for the engine's power, That along the rail will waft us soon At a thousand miles an hour! With eyes of fire see the monsters fleet Come panting through every vale, Whilst the whistle shrill afar we greet— Then hurrah! hurrah for the rail! Then hurrah, &amp;c. Sharp! sharp's the word—the train is here!— Your trunks and your bag resign!— Now the doors are lock'd, and the guards severe Hurry up and down the line. A horrid scream and a clanking blow Make the timid turn quite pale; But they cry “all right,” and you hope it is so, And it may be, quite—as far as you go. So hurrah! hurrah for the rail! No more at half-way house we call, Where coachee was known so well, That he used to stay, till we curs'd him, all, And cried, “Hoigh! are we here to dwell?” No horse to bait has the sad “White Hart,” And the “Rose and Crown”'s for sale, They've dropp'd the “Magnet,” and stopp'd the “Dart,” So go you must by the rail. Then hurrah, &amp;c. Amy. (looks off) Ha! we are lost—see—o'er yon hills! Prince. Oh, murther! The Ogre's coming! make haste—wish us further! Amy. No, that would leave us but one wish to make, And upon earth he's sure to overtake— Prince. On earth! O wish, then, that we were at sea, On board the schooner, “Bee and Orange Tree!” Amy. What! you would sooner be an orange tree. I wish you were, for safe then you would be! Prince. Holloa! what's happening to me now, I wonder? Oh, cousin! you have made an awful blunder! The Prince is changed into an Orange Tree, covered with fruit and blossom, and in a finely sculptured vase—The scene at the same time changing to a splendid garden, with terraces and statues. Amy. Alas! I didn't mean—I quite forgot! Oh! there's the third wish gone indeed to pot! And here's the Ogre too, again, I vow; To wish my wish undone were fatal now! Since then, sweet Prince, you must remain a tree, I wish to hover round you as a bee. Music—A Hive rises round Amy and encloses her, as Ravagio is seen rapidly crossing the stage, and a large Bee issues from the Hive—The music changes, and the Princess Linda, Countess of Kurtzylow, Ladies, and Servants descend a flight of steps into the garden. Chorus—Ladies and Servants—“Celarius Waltz.” Hail to our Sovereign fair, Who comes to take the air Here, in this garden, where None dare intrude. From proud pavilions nigh, Charms which make millions sigh, Here shedding brilliancy Far beyond Bude! Here, on her natal day, Banishing state all day— Making it fête all day— Laughing at Care— No coxcomb critical— No plot political— Not e'en a City call From the Lord Mayor! Linda. Let me have no intruders; above all, Keep suitors from my sight. If any call, Tell them they needn't give themselves the trouble To call again. I find men all so double, That I have made my mind up to live single, And never with the false he-creatures mingle Save in affairs of state, and rarely then; Women make better counsellors than men. I'll form at once a new administration Of all the female talent in the nation, And they shall be a young and handsome set! If an old woman should amongst them get By accident—the world can scarcely flout one, Few Cabinets have ever been without one. And then my household—female every soul. (to 1st Lady) You Lady Steward; (to 2nd Lady) you Groom of the Stole; (to Countess) You shall be Lady Chamberlain; and you (to 3rd Lady) The Mistress of the Horse—no, that won't do, Because of horses I've not left a team; I mean to travel, drive, and hunt by steam; So Mistress of the Locomotives, now, Must be the title. By-the-bye, pray how Gets on the Fairy Atmospheric line? It passes over property of mine! Countess. The works are nearly all complete, they say, Th'experimental trip takes place to-day. The Government Inspector, General Praise, Vows it's the best line going now-a-days. They talk of an extension to the moon, With branches to the planets very soon. Linda. And a fine plan it is—I shall be proud If called upon to puff up the first cloud. So order me a pair of silver bellows, 'Twill make the plated spade uncommon jealous; And since they've got a Railway King I mean To start an opposition Railway Queen; The milky way shall echo with my name, And Linda's Court put Capel Court to shame. Away, and leave me to my cogitations, My brain is full of airy speculations. (Exeunt Ladies, &amp;c.) Yes, I'll be famous in the realms of space, 'Tis time the Earth itself should mend its pace, When its inhabitants all live so fast, And this to do shall be my project vast. I'll start a line on which the world shall run In less than half the time around the sun! Air—Linda—“I'm the Genius of the Spring.” Forth my Genius now shall spring In a line completely new; I will shew the Railway King What a Railway Queen can do! Let the gents it may concern Watch the market's rise and fall, But my voice shall give a turn To the market, them and all. Yes, my Genius forth shall spring, &amp;c. Why should Earth move still as slow As she did in ages past? It is time a-head to go, And get up her steam at last. Whilst her children rush so wild O'er her globe in search of gain, At their plans so deep I smiled, For I knew what I'd in train. Yes, my Genius forth shall spring, &amp;c. Hudson touched and turned to gold, Midas like, each worthless scheme; But with this, my project bold. I'll make all his touch the beam; And my fame shall, in a rage, Put to bed the Railway King, Who, in vain his narrow guage 'Gainst my Genius down shall fling. For my Genius forth shall spring, &amp;c. But soft, what perfume steals upon the breeze? 'Tis something like those highly flavour'd teas, Which advertising grocers call their “fine Rough Orange Pekoes only four and nine.” Ha! 'Tis this splendid Orange Tree, no doubt, Which throws so exquisite a perfume out. Yes, that the scent comes from it is quite clear, But who the dickens could have sent it here? I never saw it in my walks before; With fruit and flowers it is covered o'er. I'll cull a wreath of blossoms for my hair; Tho' not a bride, a Virgin Queen may wear Such garland surely. (music—As she is about to gather a blossom, the Bee stings her) Oh, the horrid thing! That Mammoth Bee has dared my hand to sting! Who waits! what ho! My Lady Chamberlain! Enter Countess. Countess. Your royal pleasure? Linda. It's my royal pain That made me call you—A vile insect foe Has stung your Sovereign's hand— Countess. No, has it, tho'! Point out the traitor, that I may pursue it. Linda. No, for perhaps it didn't mean to do it. Pluck me a blossom from that Orange Tree. Countess. Yes, madam. (she attempts it, the Bee stings her) Oh! a great big bouncing bee, Came buzzing out ere touch the flow'r I could! And stung me dreadfully. Linda. I thought it would. Countess. You did, ma'am? Linda. Yes! I'm quite rejoiced to see, It was not out of private pique to me. But where's the blossom you were bid to get me? Countess. I cannot gather it, the Bee won't let me! Linda. Go, call the other ladies of my Court, We cannot thus be made an insect's sport. (Exit Countess) To try the same adventure—quickly bring 'em all, I cannot think the Bee will dare to sting 'em all. (music—Re-enter Countess with the other Ladies) Chorus—“Dear, dear, what can the matter be?” [Chorus.] Dear, dear, what can the matter be? Linda. Here, here, don't you call that a Bee? Chorus. Dear, dear, I ne'er saw so fat a Bee! 'Twould make a fine show at a fair! Linda. I fear the Bee must be beheaded for treason, It wounded your Sovereign for no other reason Than simply desiring some flowers to seize on, To place in her bonny brown hair! Chorus. Dear, dear, fling something at the Bee, Here, here! knock with this flat the Bee; Stand clear! Madam! O'drat the Bee! It's stung us all round, I declare. (During the last Chorus the Ladies have tried to drive away the Bee, which flies at and stings them all) Countess. Most gracious madam, what must now be done? The horrid Bee has stung us everyone! Linda. If I know what to do, may I be switched! I do believe the Bee must be bewitch'd. Countess. Arm'd cap-à-pie, let us attack the hive, And to the sword put every bee alive! Linda. Then be alive—but hold—whoe'er attacks The Bee will have the worst of it at whacks. Countess. Madam, we'll win the Battle of the Bees, As sure as Jason won the Golden Fleas. Linda. The Golden Fleece you mean. Countess. Well, fleas or fleece, 'Twas something golden, and all over Grease. So, madam, will you follow my suggestion? Linda. To Bee—or not to Bee—that is the question! Whether 'tis nobler in a queen to suffer The stings and scorns of every buzzing buffer, Or to take arms against each bee that troubles, And by opposing end them?—I can't stay, To argue this in Hamlet's quiet way. I'm stung to madness, so are all my train, And she's no woman that won't sting again! So let my Queen-at-Arms make proclamation: War to the hive! against the whole bee nation! Air and Chorus—Linda, &amp;c.—“Guillaume Tell.” Wait a little, you bouncing bee! We'll come to your cupboard as you shall see! Big as you are, you'll soon sing small! Just you sting us again, that's all! Soon will I make your drones look funny, Down on their knees your bees I'll bring; Out of your comb I'll take the honey, Out of your tail I'll take the sting! Chorus. Wait a little, you, &amp;c. (Exeunt Linda, &amp;c.—Bee flies into Hive) Enter Ravagio, &amp;c., with his seven-league boots hanging to his club over his shoulder. Rav. Confusion! I have scoured the country clean, And a most scrubby business it has been. Of my researches here are all the fruits! I've worn the soles out of my seven-league boots! Oh! I am in a most devouring rage! My thirst for vengeance what could now assuage! To be led such a wild goose steeple chase? They're nowhere—like the favourite in a race. Song—Ravagio—“I'm afloat.” I'm at fault, I'm at fault, Where the deuce do they hide? My wife's lost her stick and my son's lost his bride! Up! up, is the game! we're done brown, I can see, I'm at fault, I'm at fault! And the rovers are free! I fear the she-monarch who here gives the law, For I've got out of bounds, and so made a faux pas; My life's but ensured in the Rock roundabout, And my policy is to be never found out. Quick! quick! here to stay would but prove me a flat, I must bootless trudge home, but I cannot help that; Up! up, is the game, we're done brown, I can see. I'm at fault, I'm at fault, and the rovers are free! Yes, bootless, back again I now must jog! And really—I'm as tired as a dog; At all risks, I must set me down to rest— I'm positively footsore, I protest; For, though at home my hide is proof 'gainst sabres, Abroad, I'm quite as thin-skinned as my neighbours. Beneath this Orange Tree, whose blossoms shed— (as he is about to seat himself beneath the Tree, the Bee, followed by a swarm, settles upon him) Oh, burn the bees! They've swarmed upon my head! (runs off roaring and fighting with the Bees—Music—Re-enter Linda and Ladies splendidly armed—Female Heralds, Trumpeters, &amp;c. Air and Chorus—Linda, &amp;c.—“Robert le Diable.” Linda. Queen-at-Arms! make proclamation! Sound defiance to the swarm! Against the bold Queen Bee and nation War declare in usual form! March, my merry maids! Brave be, very, maids! Hurry'em! flurry'em! worry'em! curry'em! Smoke and smother'em! poke and bother'em! Scatter'em! batter'em! slaughter'em! oh! Chorus. Won't we give the bees a beating If they venture on our beat! She who talks about retreating, As a traitor we will treat. Linda. Though in wax they're dealers, They a Tartar yet may catch; “Sharp are our pickers and stealers” When we're brought up to the scratch! Chorus. —Queen-at-Arms, &amp;c. At the end of the chorus the two Trumpeters advance with Herald to the Hive, and flourish. Herald. Bees! bees! come out of your hive, Or else we'll smother you all alive! Linda. No answer! Then we'll storm the hive this minute. Forward! (they charge the Hive and run back again) Countess. (poking the Hive) Why, sure, there can't be one bee in it. Linda. The foe has taken flight! (all shout— The field is ours! And mine the Orange Tree's defenceless flowers! Thus with my trenchant blade a limb I sever! (cuts at a branch with her sword—the Tree groans, and blood trickles from the wounded bark) Countess. Oh, madam, did you ever! Linda. No, I never; It groans! it bleeds! Oh, most prodigious sight, Its fainting blossoms turn a deadlier white! And moved to tears by my attempts at slaughter, Distil sad drops of Orange Flower water. What wondrous mystery is this—and see? Regardless of our arms, returns the Bee Bewailing! and now making motions dumb— Surely such anguish can't be all a hum! But how to be assured of the contrary? I do remember an obliging Fairy, And here about she dwells—who, as I noted, Cut for the simples gratis—she'd devoted Much time to botany—and wrote a book Called “Language of the Flow'rs” which greatly took 'Mongst boarding school young ladies—did it not? She was an F.Z.S. and heaven knows what! Countess. Madam! I think I know the Fairy's name, 'Twas Trufio!— Linda. Trufio! the very same— Countess. Then we may every moment here expect her, Of our new Railway she is a director. (railway whistle) And hark! the train is coming, I declare! I'm sure I heard the whistle in the air! Air and Chorus—Linda and Ladies—“It's the harp in the air”—“Maritana.” I hear it quite plain! 'Tis the train in the air! At the station it calls, 'Neath our own garden walls, The Grand Atmospheric Direct everywhere! It brings back the days when we read with amaze Of Valentine so brave, of Cinderella fair, Of the Royal Ram's grave, and the Blue Bird's despair. There! There! List, lady, list; 'tis the train in the air! Music—The Fairy Atmospheric down train descends rapidly and then enters the garden, passing along the back of the terrace—The State Carriage of the Directors stops at the grand flight of steps leading down to the garden, and the door being opened by the Fairy Guards, the Fairy Trufio descends and advances, followed by the other Directors, &amp;c. Linda. Welcome, fair Fairy! you come apropos; Inform me, prithee, for I'm sure you know, Is this an Orange Tree? Fairy. Why should you doubt it? Linda. And this a Bee that buzzes so about it? Fairy. What should it be beside? Linda. It seems to be Beside itself, and all about that tree Which cried out, when I cut it, like a baby. I think there's something in it. Fairy. Well, there may be. I'll question it—perhaps it may reply. Linda. If it's a civil orange, certainly. Fairy. Tree, if you are a tree—still mute remain! If not, the nature of your woes explain. Air—Orange Tree, or Prince—“From the white blossom'd sloe.” From my white blossom'd bough, Yonder lady requested A sprig, her fair locks to adorn: But, by heav'n! I'm afraid I shall perish, For I never was cut so dead since I was born. Linda. 'Tis an enchanted tree the sight to cheat meant! Fairy. It's not at all enchanted with your treatment— Now for the Bee. If you're a Bee, be dumb; If not, I'll trouble you an air to hum! Air—Amy as Bee—“Woodman spare that tree.” Fairy, spare that tree, Cure but its wounded bough, Your very humble Bee I'll ever be I vow. Fairy. 'Tis plain that these are persons of condition, Who've been the victims of some great magician; But by my pow'r I can their forms restore— So, Bee and Tree, be as you were before! (Music—Prince and Amy are seen richly attired, in place of the Orange Tree and Hive) Linda. Mercy upon us, who is this I see? Fairy. The Princess who was changed into a Bee. Linda. And this? Fairy. The Prince, her cousin. Linda. Prince! then he's The Prince of Orange! Prince. You mean Orange Trees! I trust your Highness will be pleased to pardon My false position in your palace garden; The fact is, I did not anticipate Such an immediate horticultural fate. Linda. Sir, if I cut you, pray pronounce my sentence. Prince. 'Twill be, that you will not cut my acquaintance. (to Amy) My fair enslaver, at your feet I fall! Amy. My own true Prince! then you've not changed at all. (to Fairy) Madam, to you I owe a debt of gratitude, Although my state was quite one of Bee-attitude Compared to what it was, whilst I was bound To the fierce Ogress who your wand had found. Fairy. My wand! Amy. The wishing one. Fairy. How very odd! Prince. You'll spare the child—though she has spoiled the rod! Fairy. Oh! certainly, you've nothing now to fear; Nor from the Ogres, or myself, my dear; Ravagio is no more a seven-league stalker, He's burned his boots and changed his name to Walker. Behold him fitted out by Moses— Enter Ravagio in a full Court suit, à la Louis Quatorze powdered wig, cocked hat, &amp;c. All but Fairy. How! Rav. Don't be alarmed, I'm not an Ogre now; Ogres are out—we've all embraced professions, And seven-leagued boots are grown as rare as Hessians! One of the latest wearers of the Hessian boots was the celebrated “Romeo” Coates. Since e'en through Fairy-land by steam they're rolling, I found my own pair were not worth re-soleing; Of man-catching I hadn't got a chance, Society is so far in advance; The only way “to go a-head,” I knew, Was just to try my hand at railroads, too— So here, as chairman, snugly I'm located, Of “The Grand Bubble-and-Squeak Amalgamated,’ Capital, forty millions—prospects fine. My wife and son are stagging for the line, In Parliament we count on great support, Bankers, “Dunn, Brown, and Cutaway, Bolt Court.” Permit me. (offering prospectus to Princess Linda) Linda. No! no bubble speculation, I prize too much the bubble reputation; The lines I shall support are bonâ fide— (To Audience) But first, this couple let us tie up tidy. Say, can you patronise without compunction, This Matrimonial Bee and Orange Junction? Provisionally registered, until Your honourable House shall pass the bill? Think of the many parties interested, Think of the real capital invested, Have mercy on the author—the projector, On the lessee—the principal director! On these—whom we the engineers may call, And me, the poor solicitor for all. Though on this line there is much competition, I hope there is no chance of a collision. Both in the House and out—support our cause, We'd have no terminus to your applause! Finale—Linda—“So anch'io la virtu”—“Don Pasquale.” Come crowd again—by every train, The Bee and Orange station, And make this line turn out a fine Dramatic speculation. Oh, let us see our Orange Tree Bear fruit as well as flower; And in her glee, our “Busy Bee Improve each shining hour!” This final aspiration, Our Fairy fain would grant— She's every inclination— But feels, poor soul, she can't. She's granted four—grant you one more, At my solicitation— And newly—you'll truly— These lovers enchant! CURTAIN</field>
