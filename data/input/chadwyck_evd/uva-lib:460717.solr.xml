      <field name="fulltext">THE OUTLAW; A DRAMA IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. TO THE MISS CURRER, OF ESHTON-HALL, YORKSHIRE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Lord Clifford. The Prior of Bolton Abbey. Henry, the Outlaw. Norton, his secret enemy. D'Eston, Gentleman of Craven. Farrand, Gentleman of Craven. Harman Trueman, Keeper of a Hostelry. Cuthbert Ashton, Ranger to Lord Clifford. Outlaws and Rangers. The Earl of Northumberland. Fenwick, Lord. Grey, Lord. Swinburne, Knight. Orde, Knight. Lilburn, Knight. Ridley, Knight. Roddam, a young gentleman, page to Earl Percy. Attendants. Lady Margaret Percy. Lady Emma Fenwick. Cathleen, a young gentlewoman, their Attendant. Fanny Ashton. Wife of Cuthbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TIME. The transactions of the first four Acts occupy two days. An equal period is supposed to elapse between the fourth and the fifth. The events of the last Act take place, therefore, on the fifth day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Subterranean apartment in the Hostelry or Inn at Kilnsey. At a rude table, garnished with drinking-vessels, sit a company of men in jerkens and armed. HENRY (sings). Mine Host of Kilnsey keeps good ale, But then 'tis charged a plack the pot; The Skipton Brewers seldom fail, But then, the churls, they give it not. The knaves may keep their cellars shutâ A holier gust is yours and mine: We liberals like a liberal butt, The butt that holds the Abbot's wine. Chorus. âThe knaves may, &amp;c. The monks of Sawley love good cheer, But love to keep it to themselves; At Malham there is foaming beer, But few to drink it save the elves, And these prefer the gelid wave That from the Fall leads out its line; But when we sit in Gennet's cave, Our choice is still the Abbot's wine. Chorus. âAnd these prefer, &amp;c. King Harry is a monarch bold, But here his power is little felt; We rule as Kings of wood and wold, Our bright Toledo's at our belt. We keep our fair dominions thusâ [Drawing his Sword. Nor envy him his right divine; We make the Church pay tithe to us, And merrily quaff the Abbot's wine! Chorus. âWe keep our fair dominions thus, &amp;c. [All draw. HENRY. A truce to song. My voice is out of tune.â They do us wrong, my Brothers of the night And of the forest, blithe and brave as e'er Sung catch or shot a deer in merry Sherwood, When Robin Hood was the bold monarch thereâ They do us utter wrong who style us Outlaws. 'Tis true we love the greenwood, press for couch The mountain heatherâstrewed upon the floor Of some rock-vaulted cavernâand 'tis true, When whim commands, our arrows mark the deer, Marked fondly by Lord Clifford as his own. 'Tis also true, that when to dine we sit Beneath the spreading oak, if thirst awake, We slake it with a draught of noble vintage, Cooled in some vaults we wot of. But it is Most incorrect to call us, therefore, Outlaws. We live as men o'th'world, who clothe themselves By fleecing well their neighbours; only we, Too honourable to imitate their meanness, Take that by force which they obtain by fraud. [The door flies open. To arms! there is intrusionâ [Enter the Host. Kindly meant, though, And therefore welcome. 'Tis our ancient Host, Good Harman Trueman. Wherefore, worthy friend, This visit at so late an hour? It must Be near the time when sky-larks stir their wings To quit the dewy mead-flowers. But I judge Thy guests so long have revelled, they have left But empty casks at Kilnsey; and thou com'st, Most wisely com'st, to quaff with us of Fountains. Quaff then, and tell usâif the truth wont choke theeâ How far the Abbot's wine exceeds thine own. One fault it has; but that is found, good Trueman, Neither in taste nor hue, and Sawley's vaults Shall furnish the corrective. HOST. Noble souls! The Abbot's vintage is indeed delicious. But much I fear the end of this wild course, Which gives you thus to drink the wine of Abbots, Is hurrying on; and that these eyes must soon Rain tears as copiously as April skies, To see you caper, every breeze's pastime, 'Twixt heaven and earth, or mark your grinning heads Blacken on Skipton's gate-way. HENRY. Kind old man, I well believe that thou wilt weep for us. But drink again! 'Twill greatly help the flow Of tears whose fount hath long been frozen up, And every drop, when thus distilled from wine, Will be more worthy of the friends it falls for. HOST. Well, well, ye heed me not. And since it is so, Since moral precepts and advices sage Glance from your bosoms, as the pointed steel From warrior's breast-plate, I must tell my tidings; And mark me, tidings that involve a project, Which, deftly managed, will insure you sport Richer than frightening monk, or robbing convent. OMNES. Name it! HOST. Perchance ye know my roof to-night Is honoured by two ladies. Passing fair Are both; but oneâby good St. George of Kilnsey! My Father's saint and mineâthat one's an Angel! When Margery was young, she rolled, methought, As fine an eye as ever beamed through lash; But with this stranger's matched, 'twere as that taper Against the star of evening! HENRY. Fair indeed Must be the maid thou talk'st of, since her charms Have kindled in thy craniumâwhere till now Idea ne'er was bred that deeper reached Than spirit-vault, or higher rose than board At which thy topers congregateâa flash So very bright that it might half illumine A Poetaster's page!âBut for the project, What wouldst advise? HOST. Catch Yorkshire, friend? Not so. What if I said this falcon, come to flaunt In Craven skies, might well repay the lure? That every feather of her wing outweighs A good King Harry's broad-piece? My description Might lead you into guilt, and Trueman's conscience, Light as a child's, might with a load be burthened, That it were best ye share among yourselves. No, no! I'm but a Guide-postâstanding soâ [Extends his arm. To point the way that leads you on to fortune, Or seems to lead; but into that same way I force no man to enter. HENRY. Honest Harman, I own thy prudence and morality. But say, what is the service to be done, And who the nymph that asks it? HOST. Why, the service Is but to lead the Northern Cavalcade Through this wild land of ours, to Sawley Abbey; And the fair nymph that asks it, is the same I just described you. HENRY. And her name, dull proser? HOST. The Lady Margaret Percy. [Henry starts up, and strides through the apartment in a state of great mental excitement. He then gives the Host a sign to withdraw, which is obeyed with marks of deference and humility. HENRY. Here ends the Outlaw! FIRST OUTLAW. For a play so good It ends too soon. HENRY. Farce, friend, a wretched farce, In which I've played the part of chief buffoon, But shall no more. A nobler stage awaits me, A nobler part demands my energies. Norton, a word with you. [Exeunt Henry and Norton, and re-enter Host speaking. HOST. By good St. George! Why, what's up now? I met the Chief and Norton, Who pass'd me like the wind; and, sooth to say, Have almost taken mine in that strait passage! FIRST OUTLAW. That speed, my friend, bodes no good speed to thee. HOST. What! How! Hath there been treachery? FIRST OUTLAW. Calm thy fears. The Chief hath turned devout, that's all, and means To join his monkish sire in chanting hymns, And calculating horoscopes. HOST. 'Tis time So wild a colt should own the curb, and learn To go in harness. FIRST OUTLAW. Dost thou take it so? When it is sure as Kilnsey Crag itself, That thou mayst whistle for thy gains. HOST. Well be't so; Old Trueman hath enough of wealth. SECOND OUTLAW. Come, come; Pretend not this indifference, but confess Thou lik'st the chink of gold, wouldst rather hear The music of a thousand good broad-pieces Jingling at once, than that of Sunday bells Chiming to chapel. HOST. Why, for that, they both Are too familiar to afford a joy Superlative from eitherâthank the saint! But, to say truth, my pleasure is not in A rush or sudden overflux of fortune, Which might deprive me of my footing, and Take sense away i'th'current. FIRST OUTLAW. Thou dost like To see it come in gentle rill, as streams The wine from out the cask. HOST. Precisely so; And thou hast pilfered my comparison. âThe heir of others' wealth knows not the joy, The honest joy of him who makes his own. To start in life with little; with keen eye And ready hand, to watch and seize the first Advantage-step in Fortune's upward ladder; To lay the future pyramid's broad base With piece on piece, as day succeeds to day; To see it rise and rise, and yet to know There is not in the growing heap a coin But was placed there by labour or by thought, The hand's work or the head's;âthis, this is pleasure! FIRST OUTLAW. I thank thee, Harman, for that homily, Learned at the tapâit could be learned but thereâ Where each day hoards its little mite of gain. SECOND OUTLAW. A mite would buy the Widow's ten times doubled, Or else good water's costly. THIRD OUTLAW. That remark, Old Harman, is too bad. He means to say The Wharf hath some acquaintance with thy wine. HOST. The river, like his wit, is far beneath The level of my cellar. OMNES (laughing). Well said, Trueman. SECOND OUTLAW. But water may be carried, good mine Host? HOST. And your wit cannot. FIRST OUTLAW. Why? Is it so heavy? HOST. No; 'tis too lightâ'tis nought, which he who winnows Will not have even chaff for his reward. SECOND OUTLAW. Thou'rt sharp, sir. But the Crag hath nearer springs, And cooler than the river. HOST. I know brains To which the springs of Kilnsey, if applied, With a slight tinge of Rhenish, might be useful, So useful as to give the name of virtue To the considerate knavery that bilked them. [A general laugh. But when I showed The joy of saving cash, I meant not that Of him who hoards it for its own vile sake. I meant the pleasure of a man who cares As little for the dross which men call gold As any one that hears me; but who loves The independence and the power it gives, And, for their sakes, would strain each nerve to gain it By fair and honest means. FIRST OUTLAW. Dost glance at us In these sagacious saws? HOST. I glance at ye! Rest every cask on its own end, say I. To him that stands on Whernside-top, our Crag Appears a mole-hill; so what I might deem A crime, or fault, to your exalted eyes May seem a frolic. THIRD OUTLAW. [Throwing a piece of Money on the Table. Canst thou, in consistence With thy new-found morality, take that, And bring us its equivalent in wine? HOST. Most surely, Sir! with pleasure. THIRD OUTLAW. What, although 'Twas taken from a Bishop, honest Trueman? HOST. If thou hadst said 'twas taken from the Devil, 'Twere nought to me. Thou shalt have beverage Fit for a Kingâimported from the Rhine. SECOND OUTLAW. And innocent of Wharf? FIRST OUTLAW. Come, come; we joke The honest man too far. Away, and put That piece upon the pyramid. HOST. (going out). I will. But not while thou art here. [Aside and exit. FIRST OUTLAW. Shrewd knave! The very pink of publicans, whose rule Is, ne'er to contradict a guest's opinion That bears a goodly purse. SECOND OUTLAW. Enough of him. What of our Leader? Will he quit the pack? Or hunt with us as erst? His opening note Gives token that the scent lies strong. FIRST OUTLAW. Nor, doubtless, Is the fair Hind unworthy of the chase; And we will drink success to him.âHost! Host! [Calling. HOST (entering). Coming, ye madcaps! coming. Thereâ [Setting the Wine on the Table. FIRST OUTLAW. Fill round.â Nowâstandingâdrain a bumper; then to cover: âSoon may the noble Doe from northern woods Be captive in his toils!â [All drink and a general huzza follows. Kind Host, adieu. Broad be the basis of thy pyramid, And may its height match Whernside! HOST. Thanks [Exeunt Outlaws. God mend them! Yet if he did, it would not mend my profits. O selfâselfâself!âHow virtuous one might be, If it cost nought to be so! SCENE II. Kilnsey Crag. Henry and Norton discovered at the base of it. HENRY. O! to have seen her, Norton, in these arms, Pale as a lilyâpale as if the death These arms had saved her from, had found her there! Then to have watched returning colour faintly Shine through the whiteâas dawn's red clouds through mist!â And O! returning light to that fair eye Which opened on me like the star of Morningâ Heavens! 'twas a moment and a rapture, worth All the best hours and feelings of my life! NORTON. A tender moment, and a fortunate For a disclosure of your name and love, By which, of course, you profited. HENRY. It seems Indeed, a time most opportune; but, Norton, We are made up of inconsistencies. I hardly know, e'en yet, why I let 'scape That golden moment. Something I had learned Of visit to these wilds; and it might be That my romantic fancy nursed some scheme Of gay adventureâsome surpriseâwhen She Should grace my native scenes. NORTON. But your return To the wild band of old associates, And leading them in wrong, or in excess, Seems a strange burying of new hopes. HENRY. It may. Yet think of habit, Norton. And besides, Perchance I thought my band of gallant Outlaws Might be of use to aid whatever plan Should catch my wayward humour. NORTON. And they will; Depend upon their faith, and zeal to serve you. HENRY. You touch the very point on which I want Your best co-operation. As I told you, This Outlaw farce must terminate. Myself Will counsel D'Eston, Farrand, and the rest. Your word will weigh with the inferior names, And eke with those brave peasants, whom our leading Hath somewhat injured. Go, my friend; share this [Gives him a Purse. Among my humble followers, and assure them That if they now abandon this wild life, And settle down to honest villagers, That small donation of their grateful Chief Shall often be repeated. Act with firmness. My order, tell them, is imperative. That they must understand; yet mildly say it, Nor wound a single feeling.âPardon me A caution which I feel your prudence needs not. Farewell a while. Remember. [Exit Henry. NORTON (solus). YesâI swear it! Bear witness, ye pale stars, I will remember! If thou and thine had covered me with favours; If my Houseâwhich is ancient as thine ownâ Had been distinguished by the courtesies Lavished on richer, not on better men; I might have been forgetfulâlike the world. If thou and thine had ne'er o'ershadowed me, As the proud oak the shrub; if thouâay, thouâ Hadst never crossed my path, nor dashed my hopes, E'en where my dearest feelings were concerned; I might have been forgetful. But deep wrongs, And slights that cut like wrongs, andâworse than allâ That show of kindness to disguise a heart Of haughtiness and pride, demand remembrance! To benefits the memory is a sieve, Which injuries will not pass through. Be it so. Mine shall be treasured hereâuntil avenged! [Exit. SCENE III. Kilnsey Crag as before, but brightened by the advancing morn. Cathleen discovered near the base. To her enter Roddam. RODDAM. Sweet dawn and sweet Cathleen, met in a place Both wild and sweet! Why, you at least, Cathleen, Have entered early on the pleasant trifling, That brings your Lady to the emerald dales And craggy hills of Craven. [Contemplates the Crag. Well, this rock, Which hangs its rugged, high, and beetling mass, As if a touch might hurl it to the plain, Is worthy the attention it arrests. So, doubtless, thinks Cathleen? CATHLEEN. In sooth, fair sir, Cathleen had other musings. RODDAM. O, no doubt; Such as young maidens will have, who have faith In their own loveliness. CATHLEEN. Nay, Roddam, hear: I had a dream last night. RODDAM. I guess, so, sweet. You dreamt last night, and you are dreaming now, As soldiers dreamâof bloodâ(she starts) I only mean Of bleeding hearts, and conquests. In your vision, How many Knights of Craven, fair Cathleen, Bound in the magic circle of your gaze, Paid their devoirs. CATHLEEN. Not quite a hundred, sir. RODDAM. Ha, well; but fifty?âtwenty?âten or five? CATHLEEN. Nay, more than five or ten. I think a score. RODDAM. By Venus, a fair number to select from! I hope the vision gave you time to choose? CATHLEEN. It did, and I made choice. RODDAM. Now, kind Cathleen, You crucify me! Do not jest too far. You know my temper, and you know my heart. CATHLEEN. The one's like summer lightning, and the other Like winter snow. RODDAM. My heart's not cold, Cathleen. CATHLEEN. Indeed I would not have it so. RODDAM. You would not? Then are you kind as beautiful; and I Must thank you thusâ(Attempts to embrace her.) CATHLEEN. Presume not so, bold sir. This was not in my dreamâwhich is a trifle Too light for Roddam's ear. RODDAM. By heaven, you wrong me! When Cathleen speaks, the ear of Roddam finds No music in the tones of harp or lute! Forgive my levity. I long to hear The dream that to my Cathleen's beauty lends The charm of pensiveness. CATHLEEN. It seemed, at first, We still were on our journey from the North. The vales of Tyne, of Tees, and streamy Ure, I saw again, as in a picture. Then We reached a Dell which, ever as we went, Narrowed and deepened, and at last closed in Dark as a cavern. As we stood, methought, Flashed the red lightning. Peal on peal the roar Of thunder followed; and it seemed the rocks, Piled o'er our heads, had each a separate echo, Wherewith to mock the elements! RODDAM. You woke In horror at the tumult? CATHLEEN. No; my dream Was still prolonged, till deeper horror struck The nerves of sleep. The noise of mortal conflict Followed the thunder's rattle. Man met manâ Though whence the foe, or why there was a foe, I knew notâand there rose the clash of arms; And dying groans and garments rolled in blood Attested well the havoc of the strife. Anon, I found me in a circle grim Of savage figures, and with me enclosed The Lady Margaret and the Lady Emma, Who shrieked for rescue. To our rescue came Yourself, methought. One arm around me flung, The other wielding its red weapon,âyou Had almost freed me from the ghastly ring, When some one came behindâO God!âand stabbed you! I saw you die! RODDAM. And sweeter death, Cathleen I cannot die. CATHLEEN. I woke, and hastened forth, To try if the fresh dawn-breeze would blow off The vapour from my mind. RODDAM. And if it will not, Love, like the beam that gilds yon mountain mist, Shall shine it into beauty! [Sounds are heard. Hark! the Crag Mutters, as if a hundred hammers plied Their strokes within its bowels. CATHLEEN (looking out). It but echoes The trampling of our horsemen who, last night, Sought at a neighbouring town the rest and food This village had not. See, they gallop on, Half screened by yon tall elms. Their white plumes toss, And their arms glitter in the sun.âBut who Rides at their head? the monkish dress he wears Contrasting oddly with the martial splendour Of the gay train behind him. RODDAM. Our new Guide; The same of whom the Host apprised Lord Fenwick. Cathleen, we must returnâby separate routes; And, kind Cathleen, remember that our parting Must not be quite an age. It must not, sweet. CATHLEEN. And you rememberâto forget my dream! [Exit Cathleen. RODDAM. (solus). There passed the Flower of Beaumont! destined soon To bloom, I trust, amid the bowers of Roddam. [Exit. SCENE IV. An open Country with Whernside and other hills in the distance. Enter Henry on horseback in the disguise of a Monk (solus). HENRY. The holy garb of monks full oft, 'tis said, Mantles Hypocrisy; and if so, I Not much shall desecrate these sacred robes By brief assumption. Admirably they Will aid my scheme. Under this peaceful frock May ambush warlike weapons, prompt for use If comes occasion; and this hood, close-drawn, Will shade the features which the Lady Margaret Might recognise beneath a secular hat. âNow, Fortune, smile! and the fair maiden, wooed By Alnwick's princely turrets, shall be won Amid the wilds of Craven. [Exit Henry. [The Procession (consisting of Lords, Knights, &amp;c. Billmen, Archers, &amp;c. variously armed, and all on horseback) now appears, headed by the Lady Margaret Percy, the Lady Emma Fenwick, and Cathleen. Henry and Roddam, meeting, come forward as if in conversation. HENRY. The Tweed, you say? RODDAM. Yes. Some good two hours' ride from Tweed, is placed The mansion of my fathers. HENRY. A fine stream Old ballads say the Tweed is; I suppose A noble river. RODDAM. Why, 'tis somewhat broader Than any mountain rivulet which here Obtains the name. HENRY. You wear not yet the belt And spur of Knighthood? RODDAM. For that fault thank Fate, That wrote me Man five years behind the time When arms might win them. Since the fight of Flodden, Our Scottish neighbours have not ventured aught Beyond a straggling inroad, made in darkness, And ere the morn abandonedâno fair field In which the brave reap laurels. HENRY. True, and therefore You come to find them here. RODDAM. If laurels grew In Craven, I do think the sword I bear Quite sharp enough to crop them, Father. But I come on milder purpose. I would find The mistress, Pleasure, not the goddess, Glory, In these soft vales; and so I deem my friends would. HENRY. A goodly number, by the bones of Beckett, In search of Pleasure! Can you tell, fair sir, The names of half her votaries? RODDAM. O, for these, I would, sir Monk, you heard the lay of Duncan, Earl Percy's gray-haired Minstrel, which he sung What time the wine-cup sparkled, and this jaunt To Craven was the theme of all; for then You might have heard the catalogue, adorned With all the pomp of sound and circumstance. He sung how out of castle, hall, and bower, From Tweed to Tyne, from Cheviot to the sea, Northumberland had called her chivalry! Then, picturing that as blown which yet was folded In the intent, his strain described the land As saddened by desertion: âWansbeck sees Each tower she mirrors by its Chief forsaken; The Coquet murmurs of a similar loss; The Till laments her Grey; the Beaumont mourns The absence of her Copeland. Alne alone,â He sung, âmay sea-ward flow in silent joy, For she hath still her Percy.â Ha, ha, ha, [Laughing. I've caught the Bardic measure. HENRY. Means the song That Percy stays behind? RODDAM. It doth so, Father; And sooth it means; the Earl remains in Alnwick. HENRY. And trusts his sister here, and thus? RODDAM. Sir Monk, If thou shalt dare insinuate that aught Unworthy may befall the Lady Margaret, The Lady Emma, or that other Maiden, From any noble, knight, or squire thou see'st,â I give thee warning that thy saintly garb Will scarce protect thy carcass! Here there rides Not one that would not battle to the death, Suffer all torturesâsooner than permit A single breath to taint the virgin fame Of the least noble yonder! HENRY. Why this heat? I meant no slur upon your Northern virtues! But mark me, gentle Squire! if to return Unscathed from Craven hath in your esteem A feather's weight,ârein in your fiery temper With firmer hand. There are, and you may meet them, Who will not brook what my profession bids me Sustain with patience. RODDAM. Father, I will trust The sword of Roddam to defend its master, Whene'er th'emergence comes. Of this enough. If in my warmth offensive phrase escaped me, I pray you pardon it. I bear a soul That scorns to give an insultâleast of all Where it were safely given. HENRY. (aside). Ha! safely! Ha! Soft, fool; he judges of me as I seem, And so disarms resentment. RODDAM. Did you speak? HENRY. I wot not that I did. I was but musing, And wist not that my thoughts grew into words.â But you did name, I think, a Lady Emma: Is she a daughter of the House of Percy? RODDAM. No; of the House of Fenwick. She is sister To the young Noble whom you see in speech With Lady Margaret. HENRY. Bosom friends, of course, The two fair maidens are? RODDAM. As close their union As that of roses intermingling leaves On the same stalk. From infancy, their sky Hath worn one colourâsable now with clouds, Now azure all and sunny. Side by side, Their valiant Fathers oft rolled back the surge Of Border war; and all was triumph. Death Saddened the towers of Wallington and Alnwick At the same time; for in one week were slain The Fenwick and the Percyâone in fight With the rude Scot, the Percy by the rabble Led on by Archamber. Then brightly rose Fair years that bade them cease to sorrow, when, Admired, beloved, and sued for, in one sphere The bright companions moved. The Brothers, too, Prolong the friendship that allied their Fathers; And rumour says that yet a closer link Will join their future fortunes. HENRY (aside). Hell and death! RODDAM. What moves you so, sir Monk? HENRY. This fiery steed Chafes underneath a rider little skilled In horsemanship.âBut I neglect mine office. For see, the ladies pause, in doubt, perchance, Which of yon tracks to follow. Sir, adieu. [Exit Henry. RODDAM. (solus). Beshrew me, but I do admire this Monk, He is no canting knave, and hath a spirit Which better would become a son of Mars, Than one of his calm order. [Exit. SCENE V. Flasby Wood. Norton and other Outlaws discovered in consultation. NORTON. We are abandoned, and perhapsâI dread To speak the wordâbetrayed. OMNES (with energy). Betrayed! NORTON. Be calm. It is too true; unless obedience prompt To the Chief's mandate, sooth his altered humour. And more, my friends; of all the gentles leagued With us in revel or in guiltâso, now, It suits their mood to term itâI alone Remain to head you. Most unfitâ OMNES. No! no! NORTON. I am, 'tis true, devotedly your friend. Our interests are the same. In sports and perils I have participated; in your fallâ If that awaits youâI will also share. OMNES. Spoke like a man! NORTON. Yet be not rash, my friends! The Chief hath kindness in his nature still For the poor devils by himself misled. For proof, behold this purse, which is the bribe He offers for submission. I advise You take it on his terms. OMNES. No! never! never! NORTON. Ye are brave spirits. Yet bethink you, friends; The very act that spurns his kindness, makes His anger sure. AN OUTLAW. His anger I defy! If, after calling us around himâafter Encouraging to deeds where Danger sat And warned us offâif, after all, he leave us; Nor only leave, but slight; nor only slight, But hintâDisclosure! by th'infernal fiend, I, for myself, bid him defianceâthus! [Draws. And sooner will I dye this blade in goreâ His or my ownâthan cringe to him, and beg With all humility he would not tell What we have done beneath his high direction! OMNES (drawing). Defiance! NORTON. Then Defiance be the word!â Yet hearken me this once. Consider well What that bold word imports! The sword once bared, Ye do begin a quarrel of which none May tell the issue. AN OUTLAW. No; themselves begin it, By thus deserting and denouncing us. THE OTHER OUTLAWS. Most true. NORTON. Would I could say 'tis false!âSince, then, In spite of every warning, ye resolve Th'event to hazard, and to range, as erst, A band of gallant Brothers,âhere stands one Who, though he sees the peril, will not shrink, If so ye will, to meet it at your head. First, swear ye will be true to me. OMNES (kissing their Swords). We swear! NORTON. And I, as Leader, swearâ But here comes one That must not know of this. [They sheath their swords. [Enter Fanny Ashton. A fair good day To Fanny Ashton! FANNY. And to you, fair sirs, A better than you're like to have! NORTON. Why so? FANNY. My Father hath missed the snow-white buck, so prized By the Lord Clifford, and, suspecting harm to't, He ranges now the Forest with a band Of armed attendants. NORTON. 'Twas a noble deer! A savoury haunch of it reposes now In Gennet's caveâto which your sire is welcome. FANNY. Ye are strange madcaps! but I must be gone. [Going. NORTON. No, stay; I would admire that pretty wreath Your tasteful skill hath chosen, to set off The glossy jet of those wild ringlets, Fanny. FANNY. I meant it not to gain your admiration. NORTON. You give me needless pain, by telling me What I too truly understood before. But I can have revenge. FANNY. Pr'ythee, how so? NORTON. By saying, in return, that all in vain You rifled dell and mountain for those sweets; For they will wither ere you see the Youth To please whose eye you sought and plaited them. FANNY (agitated). You jest. NORTON. Indeed I do not. And besides, He follows one whose artificial gems So far outshine these simple natural ones, That I do fear he will henceforth despise them. FANNY. You speak to try me, now? NORTON. By'r Lady, no! I speak with the most virtuous intent To teach you resignation. Henry's false. FANNY. Thou'rt false to say that Henry's false, base man! He hath a noble nature. NORTON. Right; he hath! And seeks a noble mate. The Cottage girl, Cuthbert the Ranger's daughter, may not hope To be his final choice; and I suggest A transfer of your heart, sweet maid. FANNY. To whom? NORTON. Would it offend you if I saidâto me? FANNY. Who may the apple pluck, will scarcely turn To take the hip or wild-rasp. NORTON. But the apple Being destined for another, may give value To the inferior fruit. FANNY (taking him apart). With me, it will not. But this is idle talk. O! tell me all. To know the certainty of what I fear, Can but be agony! NORTON. The tale is brief. You recollect his absence when the moon Was last at full? 'Twas then his hap to save, During a hunt, the life of Lady Margaret, Earl Percy's stately sister; and to lose His heart at the same time. That Northern Flower, Brought from its native scenes to bloom awhile In Craven, your most faithful Lover now Takes means to keep its fragrance to himself. FANNY. Then Fanny Ashton is most miserable! âHe promised he would meet me by this tree, And in this hour. I flew and culled the wreath; For he hath sworn that not the brightest Fair In Henry's court so well became her jewels, As I the flowerets of my native dell! Then would he talk a thousand gay conceits Above the simple thought of woodland girl, Suiting their colours to my face and mind, And telling me in every wreath I made Not to omit the violetâwhich meant truth, And this is Henry's truth!âOff, off, vain flowers, [Casting the wreath to the ground. Thereâwither like my hopes! NORTON. I did not think That you would take it so to heart, else I Had told you it less bluntly. FANNY. O! most sharp Your tidings were!âThe prickles on the bramble, Whence I did pluck that rose-bud, from my hand Drew forth a blood-drop, which I meant to show For Henry's pityâfoolish girl! he leaves Thy heart to bleed, and will not pity!âO!â NORTON. Be calm, sweet Fanny; all will yet be well. FANNY. Ay, all will yet be well, when this poor heart And this hot brain have ceased to throb!âThe turf Will hide my frailties from the eye of shame; And pityâI want none of it! Tell him That Fanny Ashton hath no memory That ever Henry lived! [Exit Fanny. AN OUTLAW. Alas, poor girl! She will go mad. NORTON. Tush! she hath too much passion For that effect. It is the hurricane That clears the atmosphere. AN OUTLAW. And tears the blossom From its green stalk, to whirl it into nothing. But for her warning? NORTON. Did I widely err In the conclusion that we are betrayed? Already, as you hear, the chase is up! They might have given us timeâa single dayâ For calm deliberation, ere they struck Th'annihilating blow.âHa! heard you that? [A whistle is heard. We are beset!âStand firm. [Enter Cuthbert Ashton, and followers. CUTHBERT. Soho!âAt last We have them. In Lord Clifford's name I ask What make ye here? NORTON. And in our own, we answer, It does not suit our humour to declare Our purposeâor to Clifford, or to thee. CUTHBERT. Ill-mannered churls! but though ye veil your purpose, Mine wears no mask. Ye are my prisoners. NORTON. Yesâwhen our good swords fail usânot till then! CUTHBERT. Forward, then, lads, and seize them! NORTON. Drawâand on! [A Battle. Cuthbert Ashton falls wounded. Norton stands over him exultingly in the centre of the Stage. The Rangers, prostrate beneath the uplifted weapons of the Outlaws, on each side form a picture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HENRY (sings). Mine Host of Kilnsey keeps good ale, But then 'tis charged a plack the pot; The Skipton Brewers seldom fail, But then, the churls, they give it not. The knaves may keep their cellars shutâ A holier gust is yours and mine: We liberals like a liberal butt, The butt that holds the Abbot's wine. Chorus. âThe knaves may, &amp;c. The monks of Sawley love good cheer, But love to keep it to themselves; At Malham there is foaming beer, But few to drink it save the elves, And these prefer the gelid wave That from the Fall leads out its line; But when we sit in Gennet's cave, Our choice is still the Abbot's wine. Chorus. âAnd these prefer, &amp;c. King Harry is a monarch bold, But here his power is little felt; We rule as Kings of wood and wold, Our bright Toledo's at our belt. We keep our fair dominions thusâ [Drawing his Sword. Nor envy him his right divine; We make the Church pay tithe to us, And merrily quaff the Abbot's wine!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Abbey Garden at Sawley. Enter Lady Margaret and Lady Emma. LADY MARGARET. What a sweet place, my Emma! The high Moon Plays on the rippling waterâgilds the turrets Of the fair Abbeyâsheds a silvery light Upon the moistened green leavesâand makes gems Of the small dew-drops lying on the roses. LADY EMMA. It is the very moonlight of Romance! LADY MARGARET. It is so, Emma; and methinks this Craven Is all romantic land. Its rocks and hills, Wild and majestic, set in contrast bold With vales of emerald softness, and lit up By gorgeous summer suns, or moons like thisâ Why, 'tis a land to dream about, as having No real existence! LADY EMMA. So the Lady Margaret Throws the rich colouring of her fancy o'er Scenes not yet made familiar, and thence drawing One half of their enchantment. For myself, I would not give my own small brook of Wansbeck For any stream that murmurs through this land; I do esteem old Cheviot more majestic Than yonder rugged eminences; andâ LADY MARGARET. Nay, sweet but sworn Northumbrian! I will own All you have said, and all you meant to say, To be most trueâif that you will not check My present mood by these comparisons. For, sooth to say, I love the pleasant land, And, might one dare to own it, love its people. LADY EMMA. Of whom few specimens have met your eyes Save the rude villagers that ran to gaze As our procession passed. LADY MARGARET. One I have seenâ What think you of our Guide? LADY EMMA. As of a rude, Uncultured, uninformed, ungracious Monk. LADY MARGARET. Upon my life, ungracious epithets! LADY EMMA. What, marked you not his gesture, when aside He threw my noble Brother's hand, that proffered A liberal guerdon for the monk's brief service? LADY MARGARET. 'Twas but a fit of absence, dearest Emma, For which he did apologise. LADY EMMA. Apologise! He muttered something, but so sullenly, It seemed as if his heart did curse his tongue For making it. LADY MARGARET. I did not so interpret His bearing. But my Emma, you must own That he did paint each varied scene we passed In terms of pure and natural eloquence? LADY EMMA. Like to some wandering Poet, whose costume Is marvellously tattered and bepatched; With whom each crag is rugged, every hill Is picturesque, each brook a purling fountain, And every cavern gloomy or romantic! He prated in most nauseating terms. LADY MARGARET. You could not think so! Did you hear his voice? Noted you that? LADY EMMA. I've sometimes heard a harsher. LADY MARGARET. O! 'tis a voice of amplest compass, Emma. Of trumpet loudness to be heard in battle By fighting thousands, it hath yet the tones Of sweetest lute to melt in Beauty's bower! LADY EMMA. In neither of which places, good my lady, 'Tis like to have much practice. LADY MARGARET. They do err Who say that Love is blind. The lynx hath not So sharp an eye-sight. Maugre his disguise, I knew him, Emmaâknew the Stranger Knight Who joined our stag-chase on the wilds of Cheviotâ LADY EMMA. Amazement! Can it be? LADY MARGARET. Who saved my life When human aid seemed hopelessâbut who left The life he saved without the heart he found, For that he stole and keeps! LADY EMMA. 'Twere too romantic For this prosaic time! You may mistake. LADY MARGARET. No, Emma, no! The very traits you marked As proofs of rudeness, but confirm, to me, The truth of Love's discovery. LADY EMMA. I remember That gallant Stranger well. His air was noble; His manners such as one would thence infer The breath of Courts was native to his lungs, And Princes his first play-mates!âHe assumes An odd disguise to shroud his rank and name in. LADY MARGARET. Ah! that way lies a mist, which coldly falls Upon my love, and checks it in the bud! His rank he told not; and it makes me 'shamed To speak of what I own not to myself, Save in some tender moment when Pride sleeps, And Fancy frames her visions. LADY EMMA. Splendid ones, I doubt not, where most gorgeous castles rise Like clouds of Summer's glowing atmosphere, Based uponânothing. Cruel man! to leave Not e'en a name for love to feed upon. Had he declared his name, though it might be But simply Henryâ LADY MARGARET. Do the fates inform, And make thee, even in thy jest, prophetic? I do believe that Henry is his name! LADY EMMA. Indeed! O, then the name will fairly sound In a sad ballad chanting forth the loves, The high, mysterious loves, and piteous fate Of Henry and of Margaret, sung byâ LADY MARGARET. Hold! Thou endless jester. I am not just now In mirthful mood. LADY EMMA. And rather would enjoy The moonlight hour aloneâto muse on Henry! Well, be it so, I go. [Going. LADY MARGARET. If go thou wilt, Remember, dearest Emma, to be mute On this discovery! LADY EMMA. Silent as the Moon, That, like a prudent lady, hears all love-tales, And tells none. [Exit Lady Emma. LADY MARGARET. (solus). Go, light-hearted maiden, go! Thou lovest, and art loved again. Thy love Is placed upon a known and noble object; While I!âHe comes!âMy heart, resume the Percy! [Enter Henry abruptly, who kneels and throws back his hood. LADY MARGARET. Arise! What art thou? Speak. HENRY. A hapless wretch, If I shall have incurred thine anger, Lady, By this intrusion; blest as the blest gods, If I obtain thy pardon! LADY MARGARET. Strong and urgent Must be thy reasons, if they justify This freedom, taken by a man unnamed, And, save as Guide, unknown. HENRY. (rising). It was not thus The Lady Margaret looked, at yon cascade Among the Cheviots, when to this poor arm 'Twas owing that the bright Rose of the North Was not against the sharp and pointed rocks Dashed headlongâto exhale its fragrant life Amid the roaring whirlpool! LADY MARGARET. No; nor thus That her Deliverer looked! He stood that day Honoured amongst the honoured. Now he stands In strange and most inglorious contrast with His former self. Go to, thou art not He! The Youth I mean was honourable, was noble In soul at least, and would have rather dashed him On the sharp rocks thou speakest of, than take This mean advantage of a casual deed, Which Instinct would, without a spark of Nature, Have prompted to a villain! HENRY. Now by Heaven! That supposition wrongs me, Lady. I Claim nothing on that happy deed's accountâ Presume not e'en in thought upon itâtake No mean advantage thence. LADY MARGARET. What call'st thou then This rude intrusion? What claim else hadst thou On which to ground a fair excuse for it? Then, too, this monkish dress. Disguise denotes The man that wears it to be fool or villain, Just as his aim is base or virtuous; And which thine isâI ask not. HENRY. If correct That argument, it were indeed not worth The trouble of a question, Lady,âsince, On either supposition, I must seem An object to be rid of. LADY MARGARET. Was the act Of self-devotedness that saved my life, A thing to be ashamed of? to be wrapped In a Monk's garment, lest some eye should see, And recognise, and praise? Or didst thou think That I, the rescued, was so poor of soul, That I should blush to own my rescuer? Why, man, the meanest serf that ever toiled, Had he achieved the deed, should have been welcomed As Margaret's friend; should from my hand have ta'en Such meed as Gratitude may give to Worth, Though England's proudest stood beside and saw me! HENRY. Slight guerdon may requite a casual deed, âWhich Instinct would, without a spark of Nature, Have prompted to a villain.â LADY MARGARET. Pardon me That word, sir; it was said in haste, and rashly. I am thy debtorâdeeplyâlastinglyâ And would repay thee! HENRY. Percy's broad domains, With their long list of hamlet, tower, and town, Could not supply my guerdon. LADY MARGARET. No! HENRY. Unless Thy lovely name did grace the inventory; And that one item would compensate well The absence of the others!âFrown not, Lady; I am a man that, if I speak at all, Must speak my thoughtâbeing an old man's son Who taught me this from childhood. LADY MARGARET. 'Tis a rule Well worth th'observance, so the thought be such As doth become the speaker and the hearerâ Which thine at present doth not. Who art thou, That darest thus presume upon my goodness? HENRY. A madman! having all the signs developed That mark a madman's maladyâsave this, That I do know myself to be a madman. Yes, Lady, he that fell in love with th'moon, As classic fable tells, was sane as I, Who kneel in adoration most devout [Kneels. To a fair being, shining in a sphere Of hopeless height above me! LADY MARGARET. Is it so? Then must I think my charms have made a conquest, A glorious capture, doubtless, of a heart Warmed with no vulgar tide! But since, fair sir, I found thee in the garb of Chivalry, And now behold thee in Religion's garb, How may I style my loverâMonk, or Knight? HENRY. I do deserve that thou shouldst laugh at me; Nor will thy mirth abate, when I shall tell My parentage. LADY MARGARET. I know it all, untold. Thy father in a lordly hall was bred, Thy mother in a cloister; hence thou veerest Betwixt the hood and helmet. HENRY. Hear the truth; My sire was bred a Shepherd. LADY MARGARET. If his son Possess a Shepherd's virtues, he outshines A Baron's heir without them! HENRY. Hem!âMy virtues, Unlike my madness, have not yet developed Themselves by signs. My vicesâless obscureâ Are somewhat widely blazoned. Not a hearth In Craven, from the castle to the cot, That is not vocal with my deeds. My name Will still the wayward child, when that of Barghest Hath lost its spell. LADY MARGARET (alarmed). Ha! Thou art then the Outlaw Men talk of in these wilds!âHelp! ho, thereâhelp! HENRY. Fear nothing, Lady! The great Devil's self Would dread a hotter hell for wronging thee! Permit me to remove thisâI am notâ LADY MARGARET. Didst thou say fear? Man, I am of a race That never knew the word. But I will be Freed from the degradation of thy presence! Thou dost, it seems to me, contaminate The very air I breathe! Didst save my life To sicken it with infamy? Away! HENRY. Now by a true man's soul! I leave thee not, Till thou hast heard me out. My heart's as proud As thine is, Lady; andâ [Enter Lord Fenwick. LORD FENWICK. Ha! what means this? Wretch, hast thou ventured insult? Hast thou daredâ HENRY. When I shall come to thy confessional, I may esteem thy questions worth an answer; Till then I deign none. LORD FENWICK. Then, my surly Monk, Thy frock had need be changed to mailÃ¨d vest, Thy cowl to cap of steel; for, by St Paul, Unless thy body is betaken hence, And instantlyâthy Order shall not save thee! HENRY (tearing off his frock and hood). I ask it not. Behold me, boastful Chief, Armed to thy wish, and ready at thy word, To prove I trust to nothing but my blade For my protection! [Both draw. LADY MARGARET (stepping between them). Hold!â(to Fenwick) My Lord, I beg This matter may be left to me.âWhate'er That man's designâscarce can I deem it evilâ For one good deed by him achieved erewhile, I owe him much; and he is not my friend Who seeketh now his injury. LORD FENWICK. Enough.â(to Henry). Protected by this Lady's interference, Unquestioned go; though one disguise thrown off Leaves thee in mystery still. HENRY. When next we meetâ And meet we shall where none can interpose Between usâthou mayst learn the mystery, In the keen glimmer of encountering steel! [Exeunt Henry at one side, and Lady Margaret and Lord Fenwick at the other. SCENE II. The Interior of Cuthbert the Ranger's cottage. Cuthbert is discovered lying on a Longsettle, with bandages on his head and arm. His Wife is busied about the house. CUTHBERT (endeavouring to raise himself). Peace, woman, pr'ythee peace! I'll not have patience! I tell thee Patience is a fool, as thou art. Will Patience heal this sword-gash? Will it knit The severed sinews, and re-string my arm, As it was strung this morning? If it wont, Of what avail is it? WIFE. Good Father Peter Would sweetly show theeâ CUTHBERT. Woman, hold thy tongue! Is Father Peter wounded? What knows he Of the keen painâthe foul fiend take the pain! I heed not that. But to be pinioned here! To be laid up like a disabled hound Gored by a stag at bay!âA murrain seize The skulking scoundrels!âWhere is Fanny, wife? WIFE. Poor Fanny! CUTHBERT (mimicking her). Ay, poor Fanny!âWhy, an owl Might say as much. I ask thee, woman, where Fanny, thy daughter, is? Dost thou not hear? WIFE. Poor Fanny! CUTHBERT. Still, poor Fanny!âThou hast lost, Methinks, the little sense that thou wast born with. Canst thou not answer me? WIFE. Dear Cuthbert, be A little patient. Give me time to answer. CUTHBERT. Time! Is the tale so long? But take thy time; For, like a restive hunter, thou wilt stand, Let the vexed rider spur. WIFE. At morning-tide She left the cottage, blithesome as a fairy, And garlanded likeâ CUTHBERT. Like a Christmas mummer. O ye are idiots bothâshe for her pride, And thou for thy abetment of it. Well? WIFE. She came again at noon, her eyes in tears, Her fair cheek white as any lily leaf, And her long hair unbraidedâ CUTHBERT. A spiked pit Receive his living carcass, that dares wrong A hair of Fanny's forehead!âMy poor girl! Through all her playful life, she never said A harsh word to her Father.âDid she not Acquaint thee, woman, who the villains were That had misused her? WIFE. Meek as any lamb, She nothing did but weep, and sing of Henryâ CUTHBERT. Sing? Weep and sing? The woman's mad! WIFE. No, Cuthbert, But I do fear for her! She looked so wild When she went out, and O! she still is out, Although the moon's an hour above the Fell! CUTHBERT. That is her step! I know it. 'Tis as light As the young roe's! [Enter Fanny. Dear Fanny, wherefore this? Didst thou not know thy father had been wounded? FANNY (untying a kerchief). Ay, they will kill us allâbut I have here A charm to foil their witchcraft! These are plants Gathered in moonshine. I forget their namesâ But Henry knows them, and will tell me them. Poor Henry! I am sure he is unhappy!â But that's not it. CUTHBERT. What's Henry to thy father? What dost thou mean, my Fanny? FANNY. Nothingânothing. WIFE. Question her not. It pains her. Dearest Fannyâ FANNY. Dearest!â'Tis a sweet word, but there's a sting in't. There was a bee i'th'blossom that I clutched, And O! I bleedâbleedâbleed. WIFE. Let me bind up Thy hair, my daughter; it is such a sight. FANNY. Mother, 'tis black and bonny, and will glisten In the fair morning sun, and I will tie it About his neck, and fasten himâHa! ha! [Laughing. The stag is in the toils pitched by the hindâ Seize on him, Foresters!âBut he is strong, And, free and fetterless, darts up the hill! CUTHBERT. O my poor child! my child! WIFE. Speak to us, Fanny, As thou hast ever done. I am thy motherâ FANNY. Dost think I know thee not? Thou art my mother. There is a strange mist here; [Putting her hand to her eyes. but yet I see thee, And thee, too, father. CUTHBERT. Blessed be thy name, O God! my daughter is herself again! WIFE (brings a chair and places FANNY in it). Sit, Fanny, sit. Thy stomach, love, is empty, And hence these air-bred fancies. I will bring A little pasty and a little milk. Bestir thee, CuthbertâO! I wander too; One sorrow drives another out.âMy child, This is new milk. The cream, see, just begins To yellow o'er the surface. Drink, my dear. [Fanny, in taking it, spills a little on her garment. Mind it not, love, 'twill wash again. FANNY (setting down the milk). They dress The dead in unsoiled white. Is not Death proud To deck him like a Bride? 'Tis a cold feast, though, The worms the revellers. WIFE. Banish, dearest love, These gloomy thoughts. To-morrow is, thou knowest, The Rush-bearing of Kirkby Malhamdale, Where I have seen thee merry. Thou shalt go. FANNY. Mirth for the hostel, garlands for the church, And rushes for the dead. The garlands die, And the mirth's mute; but evermore the dead Lie snug beneath the rushesâso that they Have still the best of it.âWhy dost thou weep? I had forgotâthou weepest for my father; And I will join theeâ(she kneels beside him) Father, thou art ill; A barbÃ¨d arrow gives a deadly wound! CUTHBERT. My dear, 'twas not an arrow, but a sword. FANNY (starting up). I say it was an arrow! and I know A leech that well can cure thee. He will not Fly from my father too. I'll find him soon Where the moon shines into the greenwood's depth To woo the pale white roses! [As Fanny attempts to rush out, her Mother seizes her; Cuthbert, by a painful effort, gets upon his feet, but falls before he reaches them; and, finally, Fanny dashes her Mother aside, and Exit. SCENE III. The Abbey Garden at Sawley. Enter, from opposite sides, Roddam and Cathleen. RODDAM. Cathleen, I'm doubly gladâglad to escape From all the stir and revelry within, And glad to meet with you. CATHLEEN. I, too, rejoice To make a brief escape from sighs and tears. RODDAM. From sighs and tears! What mean you, sweet Cathleen? CATHLEEN. Some matter of deep import, and unmeet For ear that's less than noble, passes now Between the Ladies in their secret chamber, Which wets the Percy's cheek, and stamps concern Upon the Fenwick's brow. RODDAM. A mystery! CATHLEEN. Which Time may solve or not, as best he likes; I pry not into it. RODDAM. It will not change Our purposed route, I hope? CATHLEEN. No; that is fixed. We visit some wild scenes of lake and crag, That bear the liquid name of Malhamdale. RODDAM. I'm glad of it; I would not waste my time In these dull walls. CATHLEEN. Dull! spoke you not just now Of revelry? RODDAM. O, Revelry hath ta'en Devotion's seat, and pranks it gloriouslyâ 'Twere a rich scene for eye that's fond of such. At one end of the long Refectory Sits the Lord Abbot, jovial as the chief Of some proud hunting-feast. On either hand, Our knights and nobles quaff the grape's high juice, And high affairs discuss. Transverse from these, An ample board extends its crowded length, Where page and groom, where monk and sacristan, On humbler cheer regale. Apart from all, A choir of Minstrels touch the harp, or sing, At every pause of revelry. CATHLEEN. All this, And Roddam talk of dulness! RODDAM. O Cathleen, Where thou art not, 'tis dull; and, in my mind, The merrier the duller. CATHLEEN. That's a riddle. RODDAM. Which Love may soon expound. From yonder crowd My spirit fled to thee, and left me set Still as the sculptured Saint upon the wall, That with the same cold and unaltered mien Looks down upon the banquet. CATHLEEN. And when you Sat thus, in fixed abstraction, what might be The business of your spirit? RODDAM. Said I not It was with thee? It was; and then it flew But, mind, it bore thee with itâto a scene Thou knowest well! Tower, wood, and glen, at hand, And Cheviot in the distance. CATHLEEN. That description Can suit but Roddam with its woodland dell. RODDAM. Right. On the dell's green verge arose a Bower, Moss-lined, and roofed with heather. There we sat, While into it looked the mild setting sun, And all the music of the Spring waked round it! CATHLEEN. 'Twas a sweet vision! RODDAM. Yes; but, love, I had A previous one, which gave propriety To itâa vision of a little Church On Beaumont Side, where thou and I did join, With talismanic ring, the magic chain, Viewless but felt, connecting heart with heart, Made by the artistâLove! CATHLEEN. Alas, my Roddamâ What have I said! RODDAM. What thou shouldst ever say, My Roddam! Never sounded in mine ear My name so sweetly. Call me so all night, And I will listen till the morning break, And ask thee still to say it! CATHLEEN. Doubting not Thy love and faith, I will not call it back; Though it might seem tooâ RODDAM. Forward, thou wouldst say; But dream not that I think it so, Cathleen. I marked with rapture kindness in thine eye, Long ere thy tongue confessed it. But it seemed The exclamation had a tone of sadness, As well as of affection in it; why Was this, Cathleen? CATHLEEN. I heard thy sunny visions, And thought how different mine were. Thou wilt smile To hear that my strange dream of yesternight Still hangs upon my spirits, like an omen Of some unguessed calamity. RODDAM. Come, love; We will have nothing sad to mar the pleasure Of this bright hour. I know a freer walk Beside yon river. Let us thither, love! Lost in a brief delusion, we shall fancy We strayâas wontâon Beaumont's pastoral banks, And that the murmurs of this southern stream Are those of Beaumont o'er her pebbled bed! CATHLEEN (sings). Sweet Beaumont Side, and Beaumont Stream! Ye come to me in visions clear, And ever as ye were, ye seemâ Change cannot touch a scene so dear. On Hoseden heights for ever bloom The flowers that lure the mountain bee! By Beaumont Side the yellow broom For ever wavesâin lightâto me! Sweet Beaumont Side, and Beaumont Stream! There is so much of gloom and ill, That it is soothing thus to dream Earth bears one spot of sunshine still; To feel that while my hopes decline, And joys from life's dim waste depart, One bright illusionâyetâis mine, One fadeless Eden of the Heart! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A Wood. Henry is discovered leaning against a tree in a musing posture. To him enter D'Eston. D'ESTON. I ask not how you've sped. HENRY. No need to ask, If you can read th'inscription on my brow, Traced there like Cain's. D'ESTON. St Mary! can it be That the bold Outlaw droops? HENRY. O damn that word! Deeply I suffer for that folly now. An old man murdered, and his daughter mad; His daughter, beauteous once as forest flower, And innocent, and happyâbut for me! My father's grief for his degraded name, Should these things reach him.âNow, what think you, D'Eston, Of this brief catalogue? Bears it not proof That Retribution tracks the foot of Vice With more than blood-hound certainty? D'ESTON. You paint it With colours far too dark. I grieve for Cuthbert, And for his woodland blossom; but reflect, You slew him notâif he indeed is slain; And Fanny's fate is but one sad result Of ill-matched love. Your father's name will suffer Slight degradation from the venial frolicsâ HENRY. Now by the gods! you do offend me, D'Eston. Frolics with such effects, are aught but venial. My curse on Norton! He shall answer yet For confidence abused.âHeavens! I am now The Puppet, not the Arbiter, of fortune, Forced, by invisible springs, to move and look As what I am not!âList to me. Last night I saw the lady of my soul! O D'Eston, She stood in moonlight, as a seraph stands In th'love of Heaven!âEre I should urge my suit, I wished to reconnoitre the defences, To see if there were any point whereat Assault might be effective. 'Mid the conflict Of our sharp wits, I chanced, half jestingly, To hint at my wild fame; whenâcould you think it? She, though her sojourn here hath been so brief, Had learnt the history, and shrieked aloudâ âThou art the Outlaw!ââAt the sound rushed out Lord Fenwickâso they style himâwho, 'tis said, Aspires to win her love. Gods! but for her, I would, that hour, have taught him humbler views! But a bright time is coming. D'ESTON. Am I then To understand you meditate revenge? HENRY. Revenge? Thou givest it so foul a name. But we encumber each the other's path, And one had better vanish. Therefore goes My message to him, which his gallantry Dares not neglect. We meet to-day by Gordaleâ D'ESTON. To gore each other, like irrational brutes! Harry, forgive the pun and simile. But I will see this Fenwick. HENRY. Not for worlds! Noânot for Heaven! One syllable disclosed, And thou and I are foes for ever!âCome; The sun is bright on Malhamdale. Away! [Exeunt. SCENE II. Gennet's Cave in front. A small waterfall on the right. Norton, in the black gown of a Friar, before the entrance of the Cave. NORTON (solus). The plot works bravely! Cuthbert's wounds and woes, Fixed upon him, have given a deeper stain To his blurred reputation. Other deeds, Achieved to-day, may crown his infamy, And turn her love to loathing. By the fiends! That were the top of scheming.âBut suppose They met?âA meeting would bring explanation; And that would show my treachery.âBe it mine To counteract this! [Whistles. Ho! my merry-menâ [Calling. Ye must give readier answer when that signal Is heard in Gordale. [The Outlaws rush, by two and two, from the Cave, and arrange themselves in order for action,â each man with his hand on his Sword-hilt. NORTON. This will do.âNow mark, Your revels may be merry, but not long. Cool heads make steady hands. Be like the hare, That never, e'en in slumber, shuts her eyes; And when your game presents, be like the tiger, That makes no second spring!â I am advised The cavalcade is near, and wanting him Whom ye might shrink to meet. I shall find means To join it, and to note their strength. Be sure I will not risk your lives in vain encounter. Couch in the copse-wood till ye hear my whistle, And let the sound assure you of the spoils That guerdon valour when the fight is won! Meantime, bid Gennet make her fairy cave Ready for the fair captive. [Exit Norton. [The Outlaws re-enter the Cave, and the Scene shuts. SCENE III. The Church and Burial-ground of Kirkby-Malhamdale. Fanny Ashton is discovered leaning on a tomb, with a bundle of rushes and a garland on a stone beside her. FANNY (singing). The maiden to the greenwood flew, All while the moon was shining, And there she spied her knight so true Against a tree reclining. He seized her hand, that gallant proud, Where shadowy moonbeams quiver, And by the Queen of Night he vowed To love that maid for ever. [Speaks. He meant not as he said, though. He was false, Or else the ballad is. Soft! it is hereâ [Sings. The maid again to greenwood flew, All while the moon was shining; But there she spied no lover true Against the tree reclining. He came no more, that gallant proud, Where shadowy moonbeams quiver; But, mindless of the vow he vowed, He left that maid for ever! [Speaks. I knew 'twas so. He ne'er will come again, And she may weep. 'Twill ease her head to weep. I would that I had tears! I had them onceâ But this hot sun hath scorched them up. [Looks round. 'Tis strange! 'Tis very strange.âIs Fanny Ashton, then, The only Rush-bearer? They'll come anon. [Pausing. I hate these tombs. They are so dark within, And press upon the dead so!âMine shall be A common grave, with daisies on the turf; Where dew-drops lie, and sunbeams love to shineâ But none shall tread upon itânoneâbut He! Yes, he shall come, and pluck the daisy flower, And I shall hear him!âneverâneverânever!â Hark! there is music. [A procession of youths and maidens bearing rushes and garlands, and accompanied with music, arrives at the Churchyard gate. The villagers, singly or in pairs, begin to carry their bundles into the Church. A young man, seeing Fanny stops. YOUNG MAN. Glad to see thee, Fanny, At Kirkby Rush-bearing. But wherefore not Go with us, to assist in gathering flowers, And pulling rushes? Thou wast always proud. FANNY. Proud! show me aught that's not. Those flowers are proud To feel the breeze fan, and the sunbeam kiss them. But they were prouder ere thy rude hand cropped themâ 'Twas cruel in thee that! YOUNG MAN. I understand not Thy meaning, Fanny. Thou wast cruel, then, To crop that garland lying there. FANNY (mournfully). E'en so! YOUNG MAN. Thou art not well, I think? FANNY. Thou thinkest so? Thy thought's not worth a rush. Begone! YOUNG MAN (aside). By Jings, The lass is crazed. [Exit, and enter a Girl. GIRL. O, Fanny Ashton come, To help to strew the Church 'gainst winter tide! With me, then, Fanny. Thine's the prettiest wreath That I have yet beheld. Where didst thou find it? FANNY. Thou knowest not the place? But I doâwell!â O! I beseech you, go not near it! There The snake breeds, and the toad, the asp, and all The reptiles that with sting or venom take The blood from out the cheek, and crowd the brain With jarring fancies!âO! I beg you, go not! GIRL (aside). Her looks and words are strange and frightful! (to her) Well, I will not go, then. Wilt thou bear with me? FANNY (sharply). No. [Exit Girl, and enter Young Man and Young Woman. YOUNG MAN. It shall be so, now. I'll dance with none, If I mayn't dance with thee: YOUNG WOMAN. Thou'lt break thy word, If Sally Airton comes. YOUNG MAN. 'Tis ever so! 'Tis always Sally Airton! I think thee A prettier girl, by half. Now, shall I be Thy partner for the night? YOUNG WOMAN. Now that's well thought of! It might be vexing Sally, to engage Thyself for longer time. YOUNG MAN. For that, sweet teazer, I'll bind myself for ever, and thou wilt, By oath upon the mass-book. FANNY. Swear not, churl! Thou'lt break thy vow e'en as thy betters do, And she will weepâlike me. Poor girls have hearts, man, And they can feel! Dost think they cannot, Henry? That no kind breast can throb, save under satin, Where it stirs gem and jewel as it heaves?â Away! Why gaze ye thus? YOUNG MAN. We wait to have Thy company. FANNY. Thou liest! for the eye Of heedless, incommunicative bird Is hardly welcome in a true-love bower Where lovers sit! But I will nothing tellâ Why should I tell, when Time will?âAy, the blast Will tear thee, maiden, from the stem thou lovest, And fling thee to the pity of the rain, Whose tears will bleach thy red! YOUNG WOMAN (to him). Let's go. She's mad. YOUNG MAN. Poor girl! I pity her. (to Fanny) Thou wilt not go, then? FANNY. I will; for I perceive thou'rt sad, and I Am very sadâindeed I am. Go on. [She takes up her bundle and chaplet in a languid manner, and Exit with the villagers. [Enter First Young Man. YOUNG MAN (solus). I'm sure she's crazed. She would not else have talked So like a player-girl. By Jings! to blame me For plucking senseless flowers, and then to wave me With such an airâthus. [Enter Villagers. FIRST VILLAGER. Something's wrong, no doubt. O sirs, we little know what coming days May bring to each of us! SECOND VILLAGER. The most unlikely Are sometimes seized as she is. Well, may God Have mercy on the spirit He hath bruised! YOUNG MAN. It comes of pride. I never knew a girl Ape the high airs of folk above her rank, But she got humbled. FIRST VILLAGER. O, thou bearest spite, Because at our last Rush-bearing, she chose Another youthânot theeâto be set home by. YOUNG MAN. And worthy choice she made! A Fly-byth'-sky, Whom no one knewânot e'en herself, perhapsâ With gew gaws glittering underneath his cloak. FIRST VILLAGER. St Mary! what is here? A hundred horse Are clattering down the brow!âAnd see, they stopâ Dismountâand come towards us! YOUNG MAN. By Jings! I'm off. [Exit Young Man, followed by the Villagers. [Enter Ladies Margaret and Emma, with Cathleen, who walk slowly across the Stageâthe Rush-bearers continuing their work. LADY MARGARET. A pleasing scene! one that would suit Arcadia, When it was in the pink of simple usage. LADY EMMA. I did not think Rusticity imbued With so much taste. LADY MARGARET. O, Nature is the same In high and low; and in some instances I deem the low our masters. Their displays Are not o'erlaid with pomp, their mirth not checked By ceremony.âWould I were a cot-maid! She feels no sorrows, or she finds such play As this, a compensation for them all. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The Interior of the Church. The Villagers strewing the floor. Fanny Ashton wandering idly about, and singing snatches of tunes. A VILLAGER. Hush, Fanny. 'Tis the Church, and work-day tunes Are unbecoming. FANNY. Would'st have something else? I knew an old hymn once. Hark! this is itâ [Sings. Am I a flower? My sky is gloom, And the cold rain-drop chills my bloom; But let thy Spirit blowâand see! Sun-light and warmth return to me. [Enter Ladies. Am I a lamb? My wool retains Of sin and guilt the crimson stains; But flow, sweet streams, from Jesu flow! And I am white as mountain snow. LADY MARGARET. A most sweet voice! FANNY. So Henry used to say; But his was sweeter when he said it. O! My love's voice is as mellow as a bird's, When it sings in the forest all alone, And sad hearts listen! [She busies herself in strewing. LADY MARGARET. What a lovely creature! And to be thus! See, Emma, how deceived May be our judgments. I but now did envy The bliss of cot-maids!â [To a strewer. Dost thou know, good girl, Who that poor maiden is? GIRL. So please you, she Is the old Ranger's daughter; Cuthbert Ashton Her father is called; Lord Clifford's keeper, who Hath Lodge in Flasby forest. LADY MARGARET. She hath not Been always thus? GIRL. 'Tis not a week, since I Beheld her at her father's, blithe and blooming. LADY MARGARET. And knowest thou not the cause of this sad change? GIRL. No; but I fancy love, ma'amâlove and grief. 'Tis said that she was courted by a man Known but to herâone of the Outlaws, ma'amâ And he hath killed her father. LADY MARGARET. Gracious Heaven! FANNY (to LADY MARGARET). 'Tis false! 'tis false! Believe me, it is false! Dost thou know Henry? Trust me, he would not Set foot upon a snail! His pride would shun Its crawling filth, his pity spare its life For the next sunny shower! LADY MARGARET (agitated). And who is Henry? FANNY. Wouldst find the secret? Find it, then. I know, But will not tell thee. Thou art proud and fairâ They told me looks and jewels such as thine, Have wiled my Henry from me; but 'tis false. Thou couldst not have the heart! I know thou couldst not. God bless you! I shall find my Henry still. [Sings. The Outlaw leads a merry life Under the greenwood treeâ [Exit Fanny. LADY EMMA. Ha! heard you that? LADY MARGARET. O! I have heard enough To tell me I am wretched. LADY EMMA. Rather say, There was a precipice concealed by fogs, To whose dread brink your steps were hastening; But Providence hath rolled the glooms away, And you have seen the peril, and may pause! LADY MARGARET. True. Yet this solving of a painful doubt Is trial to the heart! [Exeunt. SCENE V. Green in front of the Inn. The old Villagers seated on benches around, and the young dancing. During the dance Lords Fenwick, Grey, &amp;c., appear on the Stage. LORD FENWICK. Youth, health, and mirth; light limbs, and lighter hearts; What lack these to be happy? LORD GREY. Ask the Host. Yonder, with rosy face and rounded front, He bears a frothing pot. LORD FENWICK. I understand you. The Host would sayâmore liquor; and perchance A few broad-pieces to procure them that, Were no unwelcome donative. Host, ho! [Calling. [The Host comes forward, and receives money from two or three of the Party. LORD FENWICK. Take these, my friend, and let the villagers Rejoice therewith, till our return from Gordale; When, should the contribution be too scant, We may augment it. HOST. Thanks, ye generous strangers. LORD GREY. It strikes me, too, that our rude knaves had rather Stay here and join the sport, than wend with us To gaze on crag and brushwood. LORD FENWICK. Be it so; If that they will not brawl with these good peasants. HOST. There bears a dark cloud over Gennet's gill, And the West blackens o'er the fell. These signs, Amid our hills, portend no distant storm. If Gordale is your aim, 'twere best ye reach it Ere the day change. LORD FENWICK. We thank thee, sir. A Guide Is all we want to 'vail us of thy counsel. HOST. And that is soon supplied. Here comes a man, One of a holy Brotherhood, whose cell Is near this place. LORD FENWICK (glancing at GREY). I relish not conductors Drawn from a sacred Order. But go on. HOST. He weeps and wanders, mid the glooms of Gordale, From morn till eve. What brings him now, I wot not; Unless, as I suspect, it be to preach The Rush-bearers a sermon on the sin Of passing time so happily. As lief Would I see aught as him. LORD FENWICK (smiling). And so wouldst make A transfer of his services to us? Well, I like candour, friend, and will remove This marrer of enjoymentâif he list. [Enter a Messenger. MESSENGER (showing a letter). This for the Lord of Fenwick. LORD FENWICK. I am he. MESSENGER. I wait reply. LORD FENWICK. A moment, lords, excuse me. [Reads. Go, tell the writer I will meet himâno; Myself will bear my answer. Wait apart. [To Messenger. My lords, a slight affair demands me hence. Nay, question notâa trifleâI will join Your train again ere long. [To Messenger. Lead on, my friend. [Exit Lord Fenwick. [Enter Norton. LORD GREY (to Norton). Father, we would see Gordale. We are strangers, And may, perhaps, avail us of that name To ask the guidance of so good a man As we have heard thou art. [Enter Ladies. NORTON. Would I could teach you, When Gordale opes his chasm, to elevate Your minds from the low pleasures of base sense, To Him whose fiat scooped it, or whose earthquake Rent its huge cliffs asunder, to attract The gaze of ages! LORD GREY (smiling). Who knows but we may Be diligent pupils under such a tutor? The ladies are devout. So lead, good Father. [As the strangers are quitting the stage, the Scene shuts. SCENE VI. A Landscape. Enter Lord Grey and Roddam. LORD GREY. I think thou'rt prudent. RODDAM. For that flattering thought I stand your lordship's debtor. LORD GREY. Did you note The Monk, our former Guide? RODDAM. I did, and deemed His manner most unlike the garb he wore. LORD GREY. There guessed you rightly. Yet you could not dream That in such peaceful garb there stood disguised A Bandit leader? RODDAM. No; in sooth, I could not! LORD GREY. Yet so it is. At least so fame reports it. Now mark me, Fenwick hath received from himâ We cannot doubt the sourceâa message, whichâ We doubt as littleâis a hostile one. Too brave to weigh the risk of a rencounter With one who laughs at honour and at law, Lord Fenwick gives the meeting he demands. RODDAM. And you are here to tell it! Youâhis friendâ Are calmly talking of his risk, while he Dies, it may be, amid a horde of villains!â My horse there! LORD GREY. Honour to the noble soul That speaks in thee! My friend is not alone. Swinburne and Ridley, Orde and Lilburn follow To vindicate the right. I but delay To bid you lead the cavalcade to Malham; And ask you, should the ladies mark our absence, To find such fair excuse as may allay Their apprehensions. RODDAM. That safe post be his, Who fears to look on danger! I'll with you. LORD GREY. Bethink thee, one fair maid may lack protection. RODDAM. If you mean insult, my good Lord of Warkâ LORD GREY. I half repent my choice. I deemed thee prudent, And still will deem thee soâunless thy folly Engross one moment further of a time Too precious to be wasted.âFare thee well. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. A Glen. Henry is discovered beside an ancient Oak. To him enter Lord Fenwick. LORD FENWICK. In ignorance of what thou artâin doubt Whether I meet a man entitled to Receive from me this courtesy, or one That hath no claim to itâbehold me here, In answer to your missive. HENRY. You have done What I expected, lord; and thus far, therefore, Will I, at present, satisfy your doubt. Believe that, if I fall, you will have shed Blood precious as your own. If fate reverse The issue, it may help to sooth your death-pang, To think you perish by no vulgar brand. LORD FENWICK. This is evasion, and would clear me, did I shun the combat. HENRY. If your northern courage Shrinks as it nears the hazardâbe it so. LORD FENWICK. My courage hath enabled me, ere this, To smile at hazard equalâtake my wordâ To that which threatens now. But we are men, And should be rational; nor draw the sword Without good cause. HENRY. Agreed. My cause is goodâ Your last night's words of insult. LORD FENWICK. But those words, Addressed to one whoâas I thoughtâhad offered Outrage to her that claims my guardianship, Were meaninglessâsince outrage there was none; Inapplicableâtherefore inoffensive. HENRY. Another valid reason why your sword Should keep its scabbard! LORD FENWICK. From another lip, Or at another time, I had not brooked That haughty sneer. Nor would I now, but that I would not prosecute a baseless quarrel; And such is oursâif something yet unnamed Stir not your blood. HENRY. Somewhat there is, perchance, Which I would have concealed, did not I find Your valour needs a spur.âNay, hear it now. I will be brief. The Lady Margaret claims, You say, your guardianship? LORD FENWICK. And proudly say it. HENRY. No doubt. But what if I should say that you No longer shall keep watch, as dragon-guard, On that Hesperian fruit? LORD FENWICK. Why, then I should But laugh at thy most impotent presumption! HENRY (aside). At last the metal rings!â(to him) Thou wilt not, then, Resign thy bold pretensions to that lady? LORD FENWICK (aside). Sits the wind there?â(aloud) Hadst thou that question put Less haughtily, I might have deigned reply By a plain statement. But thus bullied, I For answer tell theeâNever! Right in you, Or any one, but most of all in you, Upon me such condition to impose, I do deny, repel, and treat with scorn! HENRY. Then you reject the only chance of peace. I pray you, ponder. LORD FENWICK. Palsied be my tongue, When it seeks peace on terms which Honour spurns! And blasted be my fame, ifâhaving come Alone to give thee, what thou couldst not hope, The chance of losing by a true man's brand The felon life predestined to the halterâ I let thee now escape me unchastised! HENRY. That speech wants little to be eloquent, Except one item of some momentâtruth. Thou come alone? Look yonder, and confess The falsehood of the vaunt. By heaven! thy prudence Equals, my lord, thy valourâor transcends it. [Enter Grey, Swinburne, Orde, &amp;c. But let them come. (Drawing) Here, like this mountain oak, I bide the fury of the storm. Come on! Come one by oneâI ask no favour elseâ And thou the first! [To Lord Fenwick. LORD FENWICK. (to his Friends). For this inopportune, Though well-intentioned zeal, I thank you not. Backâif you love me! Backâunless you deem me The craven which this braggart says I am! HENRY. Proclaim me braggart when my deeds belie The promise of my words. LORD GREY. And him a craven On the same terms. But hear! A high-born man, Whose life hath public value, is not called To risk it in a brawl with one whose life Must be of lessâMAY be of no concern. And therefore have we comeânot to o'erpower A single warriorânot to interpose, Unwarrior-like, between you; but to learn, Ere blow be struck, whether our friend is matched With fair antagonist. Of that assured, Let triumph gild the braver! LORD FENWICK. Stop, my friends. Too much hath passed between us, now to plead That point of custom. Be he what he mayâ Noble or ignobleâor high or lowâ True man or robberâhe shall have his wish. No more, as ye are friends! [A single combat, in which Lord Fenwick's Sword is forced out of his hand by Henry. HENRY. Demand thy life. LORD FENWICK. Never! My name in arms is now eclipsed; My life is worthless. Take it. HENRY. Foul befall The man that strikes the vanquished!âNo, no, live. But bar my way no more.âNow for the nextâ LORD GREY. Your true nobility of soul, brave Stranger, Disarms us all. To that, and not to any Less lofty motive, do we beg you give Our wish for peaceâa wish, you may believe, Not usual in a Borderer. HENRY. I believe it; And when we meet again, there may be less Of mystery, more of pleasure. Fare ye well. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Gordaleâa tremendous mountain chasm. Enter Roddam and Cathleen. CATHLEEN. O Roddam! why so rash? Yet, yet return! Some dread thing is about to happen! Stayâ Turn not that rock, but listen! Told I not Of dell that narrowed, and at last closed in? And told I not of thunder? Are you mad! The dell is narrowed to a point; o'erhead, The clouds have veiled the sun; and if these clouds Bear not a storm within their lurid halls, No sky will henceforth thunder! Let us back! RODDAM. And we were fools, my love, to turn us back Upon such ground as the coincidence Of a dark dingle with a maiden's dream. On, my Cathleen; nor fear that harm can come To Roddam or to thee. For thy sweet sake Yon clouds shall pass away, and heaven be blue As that fair eye of thine, where loveâinspheredâ Shines through its tear as shines, the western star Through the fine dews of Eve! [They enter the chasm. Heavens! what a sight. CATHLEEN. O God! the very scenery of my dream! RODDAM. Why then thy dream was highly honoured, love; For England hath no nobler scene than this. [Enter Ladies Margaret and Emma, with Norton and part of the Procession, on foot. All gaze in silence. NORTON. Your silence moves no wonder. Gordale hath, In its first burst of unexpected grandeur, A spell to awe the soul, and chain the tongue. How great its Maker then! LADY MARGARET. Now this repays The toil of our long journey!âEmma, look! Look, Cathleen, Roddam!âIt might seem a tower Whose architects were giants, did yon stream Mar not the fancy. RODDAM. Or a cavern hewn From out the solid rock by hand of genii! LADY EMMA. Or fairy palace, by enchantment raised, To hold the elfin court in! LADY MARGARET. 'Tis a scene Too stern and gloomy for those gentle beings, That love the green dell and the moonlight ring. I like my first impression.âWhence the stones That cumber the wide floor? NORTON. These scattered fragments Have fallen, Lady, from the toppling cliffs, Detached by slow decayâperchance by lightningâ And piled through silent ages. Fear not, gentles; Beneath the bend of this far-slanting rock, We stand exempt from perilânothing less Than some discourteous earthquake being able To make the massive Giant fall and crush us. LADY EMMA. There is a peril, Friar, which, I fear, Neither this Giant nor his friends can save fromâ The peril of a thunder-storm. CATHLEEN. (to RODDAM). O, hear! LADY MARGARET. It were a deadly sin 'gainst taste, so soon To quit this scene of wild sublimity, In dread of an imaginary danger. My spirit rises while I gaze, to see The shadows deepen, as the clouds o'ersweep The almost-meeting crags above our head, Until the cataract, that whitely falls As if from heaven, becomes its only light,â Seeming, indeed, a gush of moonshine poured Through a rent cloud, when all beside is gloom!â [Lightning, That flash came not from waterâHa! againâ [A storm of thunder and lightning, during which the heads and weapons of the Outlaws are partly seen among the clefts. NORTON (aside to the Outlaws). Await my signal. [They retire. (Aloud) 'Tis a fearful hour! God! what a crash was that! Flash crowds on flash! It lightens as if Satan sat i'th'clouds, And fed their fires; while the redoubling crags, With most terrific mimicry, send back The rattle to the sky!â (Aside) By heaven! they quail. These northern warriors, who would fearless charge Thrice their own number in a Border feud, Are worms before a danger which doth mock The spear and mail of armÃ¨d bravery! Now is my timeâ [Whistles, and enter Outlaws. NORTON (with affected alarm). The Outlaws!âAll ye saints Protect and save us!âHoly Mother, save Thy servant! AN OUTLAW. Yield! Your purses or your lives! NORTON. Good friends, submit; else we shall never see Another morning dawn! RODDAM. Monk, hold thy peace, Else I will cleave thy head! [To the Outlaws. A bold demand, And one that, numerous as ye are, will task Your prowess to enforce it. (to Norton) Old man, bid The ladies keep the shadow of the rock As they regard their safety. We will throw A rampart of good steel before them. Formâ Quickâright and left behind me. Yarely!âTen Good men and true are match for fifty villains! [A Battle. Strike fastâand home! Each thrust, so sent, rids earth Of so much crime! [Fights. Thunder continues. High omens are about usâ Heaven sends its lightnings to direct our blows, It thunders for our triumph! [Fights. AN OUTLAW (rushing upon RODDAM from behind). Hell receive Thy fiery soul! [Stabs him. RODDAM (turning fiercely round). O Villain! dastard! die! [Stabs him. That was a coward's trick. Fight, gallants, fight! They waver.âOn!âCathâuse her name I dare not, Else should that name, heard o'er the tumult, make The brave be braver! [Fights. [The Battle continues. The Borderers give way. RODDAM. Cowards! dastards! stand! Rally again, or be disgraced for ever! What will they say by Cheviot? [Fights. Vain! they leap O'er crag and cataract like startled deer; And I am left.âCurse on the coward blow Of that expiring caitiff! [Staggers. [The Outlaws seize and bear off Ladies Margaret and Emma. Cathleen flies towards Roddam. Villains! noâ Ye shall not do that outrage! (falls) O Cathleen! CATHLEEN. 'Tis done! 'tis done!âHe would not hear me!âRoddam! O speak to me!âHe never will speak more! Dead! dead!âO misery! [To the Outlaws. Hereâcomplete your work Of butchery! Stretch me in blood beside him, And I will die with thanks upon my tongue! [She raises him in part, places his head upon her knee, gazes upon him, and exclaimsâ He breathes, he lives! Thank Heaven! [The Scene shuts. SCENE II. Crags near Gordale. Enter an Outlaw. OUTLAW (almost breathless). He must be near. Ho! Norton! [Calling. [Enter Norton. NORTON. Fiends pluck out Thy foolish tongue! Why shouldst thou name me, ass? OUTLAW. I did not name you ass; but if you stay Many hours longer in this vicinage, You will have earned the name. NORTON. No insolenceâ What meanest thou? OUTLAW. Henryâ NORTON. Damnation! what? Speak, what of him? OUTLAW. He met usâBland and meâ As we were carrying off the Lady. Bland At the first menace, dropped his sword, and begged Forgiveness. NORTON. Base poltroon! And thou? OUTLAW (hesitating) WhyâIâ I did the same. NORTON. Two quailed to one! The slavesâ But at the least, ye did confess nought. He Knows nothing of my part? OUTLAW. Bland told him all! How you had trained us to oppose his will; Had planned th'attack and capture of to-day; And above all, had bound it on our souls, To give the Lady Percy to believe That he was author of whatever outrage She might have suffered. NORTON. Thou didst contradict this? OUTLAW. I durst but sanction what my comrade said; But took the earliest chance to steal away, In hope to find you out, and give you warning To 'scape the deep revenge the Chief hath vowed. NORTON. Thanks; but I fly not!âDesperate was the throw, And the die turns upâRuin; but to whom? That waits decision.âGo. I would compose My mind a little, were there a retreat. OUTLAW. The Cave. NORTON. The Cave! Thou'rt mad, or else a traitor! That were the first explored. OUTLAW. Ay, such he deems Thy thought to be, and therefore will not search it. NORTON. That notion seems a shrewd one. [Puts off his disguise. Take this garb; I have no further use for it. Be true. [Exit Norton. OUTLAW (solus). He has no further use for't. So I think. And I opine that, save by some good fortune, Of which I dream not, the next suit he gets, Will cost him nothing, and will last for ever! [Exit. SCENE III. Gennet's Cave and the Waterfall. Henry is discovered in the act of supporting Lady Margaret. LADY MARGARET. Where am I? Where is Emma? Where my friends? Have they all perished in yon dreadful cavern? Am I the singly saved? Speak, Monk! Speak, Outlaw! My Evil Genius, speak! HENRY. The last, sweet Lady, I wot not why you call me. True, I am Most evil to myself; to one beside I am most evil; but to thee! LADY MARGARET. Forgive me, If in my terror I have done thee wrong. But I will call thee aughtâmy Guardian Angel Ever at hand to rescue and to save! That I will call thee, and will add whate'er My power may promise, or my purse afford, If thou wilt tell me that my friends are safe! HENRY. Dear Lady, be composed. I have already Assured thee all is well. My friend's report, Which but thy swoon prevented thee from hearing, Bore that some others of your northern train, Not in the former company, had reached The scene of conflict; that th'assailants then, On this accession to their foes, had fled; That Lady Emma, rescued by an archer, Had joined her friendsâ LADY MARGARET. Thank God! And Roddamâ But that brave youth is slain!â HENRY. I know not that. LADY MARGARET. And Iâwhy am I here? O! what have I Or said, or done, to merit this unkindness? Speak, why is Margaret the selected victim Of him who saved her life?âBut hear me, villain! The stainless Daughter of a martial line Cannot receive an insult unavenged! HENRY (kneeling). If in my soul there ever lurked, or lurks, One thought intending aught but good to thee, May the next flash yon awful sky shall send, Strike me to ashes! LADY MARGARET. Art thou not the author Of this day's work? HENRY. So help me Heaven, no! LADY MARGARET. Nor knowest our assailants? HENRY (rising). There I cannot Plead innocence. Some guilt is justly mine; For which I suffer penanceâthy suspicion. But I am foully wronged, as one shall know [Thunder. And pay for! Hark! more fiercely and more near The thunder rolls. The lightning wraps the crags In its most perilous flame. But we are nigh The shelter of a caveâ LADY MARGARET. Speak not of that! Here stand I in the face of Heaven, whose darts Fly not at random, but obey the hand That makes them ministers to strike or spare; Here is no danger save from One whose pity Marks the poor sparrow fall. I will trust Him, Although he seems in angerâbut not thee! HENRY. Thy will be law. I did but mean to find thee A shelter from the storm. But O! believe, That cave were safe as Alnwick's princely bowers; And let me add, those princely bowers may see Fair youths of noble name and martial deed Contending for thy smile, but shall not see, Amid the crowd of suitors, one that loves thee With love so true as mine! LADY MARGARET. Talk not of love! Of that no more! If thus my foolish dream Is over, let it end!âThou hadst, poor youth, A part in Margaret Percy's bosom onceâ I shame me not to say it now, when I Am wretched, and thine eyes do look their last Upon meâbut 'tis done. From this hour forth, I cast thine image thence, and thought of thee Shall never haunt me more! HENRY. To have been thusâ To have engrossed, though but a moment's space, One thought of thineâshall be the cherished feeling, The secret triumph, and the silent pride Of this full heart, till its pulsations cease In the calm grave! But since it hath been thusâ And that Earth's fairest lips have just avouchedâ Why not be thus again? LADY MARGARET. Impossible. Ask thy own life. HENRY. Lady, my life hath not Been free from stain; yet are there greater villains, If that must be the word. LADY MARGARET. That I would hope. And yet connexion is confessedâallianceâ With men of blood! HENRY. A fitter time will come, When all shall be explained. LADY MARGARET. It needeth not; I have no interest in the knowledge. Yet There is one question I should like to ask, Ere we two part for ever. Know you aught Of a poor girl named Ashton? HENRY. Said I, no, I should say falsely. LADY MARGARET. That at least seems candid.â Art thou the cause of that fair girl's distraction? HENRY. It was deep villany to be the cause; But, being so, 'twere double villany To sayâI am not. LADY MARGARET. Then did blood of Kings Flow in thy veins, I should esteem myself Degraded by thy suit!âAway, and beg Pardon of outraged Heaven! HENRY. Alas! my heart Is not of adamant. I feel too late The ruin I have wrought. Thou art too good To know how passion in the heart of man, With the swift out-break of a summer flood, Bears in its course the meadow-blooms of virtue, And leaves the banks a waste.âBut I will not Attempt the palliation of my guilt. I am unworthy, Lady, to remain In presence of thy virtue; and not long Shall my taint-breathing infamy bedim Its all-pure mirror. Having joined your friends, Our paths will thenceforth separate; and if Thine be but bright with sunshine, that reflection Will form a rainbow on the lowering cloud That now must darken mine! LADY MARGARET. Yet whyâO! why Should thine be dark? Thy manners and thy speech No token bear of vulgar birth. Still less Dost thou seem one that skulks by cave and brake, Cheering his crew to most abhorred deeds, At whose recital good men weep. Then why Not quit the base career, and riseâay, riseâ For well I ween the meanest state life hathâ The state of Bondman fettered to the soil, And sold and bought with thatâis high, is noble, Compared with thine! HENRY. Ask the bruised wretch, convulsed With agony, to re-ascend the rock, Down which his madness or his fate hath dashed him. Alas, his feeble limbs could ill keep stance On ledge or jutting stone. The shoots by which Uninjured sinews might attain the summit, Spring greenly but to mock the sight of him Doomed at the base to die!âBut if my heart Had power enough to scale the precipice, And be what it hath been, how valueless Were e'en success, when thouâthe Vision bright That on its top shed radiancyâart gone, And all is dull and blank!âNo, no; that light No more on high, fame, name, and character Are things not worth a thought! LADY MARGARET. Thou talk'st romance. Now hear the truth. A Percy's daughter comes not In contact with disgrace. Yet say I willâ If my poor smile can win thee from this mean And guilty course, thou hast it!âO forgiveâ Be all thou wast at Linhope's wild cascade, When the North saw her Chivalry outshone By the young Stranger Knight! Whose eye like mine The change shall greet? Whose heart like mine rejoice? And O! whose handâbut mineâreward the struggle Highâhardâand holy? HENRY (kneeling and taking her hand). Noble maid 'tis done. That word redeems the past, and saves the future! Beloved by thee, I am not all degraded; Beloved by thee, I shall not sink again Beneath the proud height of thy love! That word Hath torn the mysteryâas a garmentâfrom me, And now I tell theeâ [Shouting is heard as of persons in search of some one, and calling to and answering one another. We are interrupted. It means not. Thou shalt learn all soon. But how? Was it a dream? Or did I hear, in sooth, That thou art the affianced Bride of Fenwick? LADY MARGARET. Indeed thou must have dreamt it, Henry. HENRY. What! Is there, then, no alliance soon to be Betwixt your Houses? LADY MARGARET. Yes. My Brother's troth Is plighted to the Lady Emma. HENRY. Fool! Madman!âBut it is well no blood was shed. The noble Fenwick!âAs I live, 'tis heâ [Enter Lord Fenwick. HENRY (taking his hand). My lord, I blush to meet you. I but learnt This moment how insanely I have acted. Can you forgive me? LORD FENWICK. Stranger, as a debtor That lacks wherewith to payâ HENRY. No, no. Not long Shall thou so designate me. To your care Permit me to restore your lovely ward, Honoured and safe as when at first exposed To the rude rangers of these craggy glens. Adieu to both. I follow soon. [Exit. LORD FENWICK and LADY MARGARET. Adieu! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The Interior of Gennet's Cave. Norton discovered at the entrance sword in hand, and couched as if ready to spring upon some one. Fanny Ashton near him. FANNY. Norton, what watch you for? NORTON. A wild boarâhush! (aside) This mad fool will betray me, if I am not Betrayed already by yon clownâHe moves! He turns awayâreturnsâDamnation!âstayâ FANNY ASHTON. This is the Fairy's cave. Hast seen her, Norton? But she ne'er shows herself, except to eyes That soon must close in death. Would I might see her! It were so sweet to die, and dream no more. Dost thou dream, Norton? NORTON. Peace I say. FANNY. I will; Because thou art so surlyânot like him. He said I was a fairy; said my eyes, With every sparkle, wove a spell around him, That made me lovelierâdearer! Norton, this Shall never more be styled the cave of Gennet. 'Tis mine! Here will I dwell; and when my brain Burns, I will bathe it in yon gentle Fall Whose waters light my cavern. Then at morn, I'll sprinkle me with dew-drops from the rose; And when the Moon looks o'er the fell, I'll mount Her beams, and seek my love! [Lightning. [She throws her arms around Norton,âexclaiming Save, save me, Norton! That came for me!âI felt it suck my soul!â But now I breathe again.âYet hold me fast! [Faints, NORTON. She spurned me, and for him. I little cared For her sake: yet it galled me to reflect That e'en in low amours he baffled me. FANNY (reviving). Dearest! confess it now. Thou hast deceived The trusting Fanny, Henry! and I must Avail me of thy dagger. Hast forgot How when we sat beneath yon mountain-ash, When I was well, and never plagued with dreams,â You showed it me, and told me that if ever I found thee false, I was to stab thee with it? Now give it me. Dost think I'd kill thee, love? But I will see thy heart, and look on her That takes my place thereon!âand I will stab her, For there is triumph in her smile.âTake that! [Thrusts as with a dagger. NORTON. I am not he you mean. FANNY. Not Henry? Noâ Thou art not. Then, how dreamt I he was here? NORTON. He may be here anon. Just now he stood With his new love beside the waterfall. And if thou wouldst do what he bade thee, Fanny, My dagger's at thy service. FANNY (eagerly). Give it me! [He gives it to her. Now will I couch like thee; and when he comes, Will spring upon himâthus. [Places herself beside him. NORTON (aside). The proverb says Drowning men catch at straws. But now for me Aught to expect from this girl's brain-sick whim,â Why, 'twere to clutch a thread of gossamer Waved by the summer wind from hawthorn bush Across a headlong stream that bears me down! Yet let him stand the risk. If fails her dagger, My sword may follow with a surer blow! [Henry, without, gives the signal whistle. NORTON (to FANNY). Speak not! He thinks to find some comrades hereâ [Enter Henry. Nowâquickly! spring! [To Fanny. [As he enters, Fanny springs forward, then pauses, and, shrieking, throws away the dagger. Norton aims a mortal blow at him, which Fanny Ashtonârushing between themâreceives in her breast, and instantly falls. HENRY (drawing). O damnÃ¨d villain! thou hast spilt a life I would have given my best domain to save! Miscreant! I might have pardoned thee again, But for this deed. But this weighs down thy soul To hot perdition! NORTON. Pardon! I despise Thy mercy, as thy vengeance. Strikeâ [They fight. Norton falls. HENRY. Thou hast it At last, perfidious wretch! NORTON. My curse be on thee! May woes, like vipers, writhe around thy heart, Gnawâgnawing it through life; and may your death Be speedyâand as bloodyâas my own! [Dies. HENRY (kneeling and raising FANNY). Live, Fanny, live!âThou hast been deeply injured; But live! and there is nothing thou canst ask But I will gladly grant theeâ FANNY. 'Tis in vain!â Dear Henry! I have been so ill, so fevered, I thought my brain would turn; but I am now Myself again. I feel me dying, Henry! I have no wrongs to urge. I was in fault To dream that one like you could ever stoop To union with a peasant. But my parentsâ Dear Henry, think of them. For my sake, be To them what Fanny Ashton should have been, Their stay in age. And O!âI would not have A thought of me to mar thy happiness; Yet if thou canst, some pensive moment, think Of me without a sorrow,âthen, my love! Recall me to thy mind. Remember meâ Not as th'unkind upbraider of a wrongâ But as a meek, erring girl, who loved too well Where love was hopeless; yet whose death was sweet, Thus dying in thine arms, and knowing thou Wilt close my eyes, whose imageâever dearâ Is dearest at this moment, and shall be Their last impression ere they fix for ever! I can no moreâmy HenryâO farewell! [Dies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Library in Barden Tower. Lord Clifford and the Prior of Bolton seated at a table covered with papers, books, and mathematical instruments. LORD CLIFFORD. Alas, lord Prior, we must interrupt The pleasant course of our most loved researches! To watch the wanderers of the nightly sky, That shed their influence, adverse or benign; To trace the mysteries of Nature's work In earth or waterâwhether we remark The ebbs and flows of Ocean as he leads His mighty waves beneath the moving moon, Or seek, by chemic fire, the still-hid stone Philosphy hath worn her eyes to find;â These, our enjoyments, must give place awhile To painful duties. PRIOR. God's high will be done! When open you the court? LORD CLIFFORD. I wait the coming Of certain of the northern visiters, As evidence against the robber horde. PRIOR. How many of the villains are secured? LORD CLIFFORD. Some twenty, and with them a sly old fox That keeps the hostelry at Kilnsey. PRIOR. Ah,â Is he suspected? LORD CLIFFORD. Yes, of leaguing with, Abetting, and concealing them. PRIOR. I hear Earl Percy hath arrived. LORD CLIFFORD. His lordship came Last night, and will attend the court. He begs A previous interview to talk with me On matters of high moment.âWould 'twere over! For I do hate so much these shows of lifeâ The words that nothing mean, the smiles that hide The pain of the tired heartâthat, by my faith, I could e'en now exchange this noble name, My lordly halls, and all their owner's power, For the low cottage and the homely fare, The unvexed spirit and the quiet sleep I had among the glens of Cumberland, Ere I was wakened to the certainty Of my true rank, and all the cares that cling to't! PRIOR. That mood, my lord, is but a passing cloud, Soon to depart and leave your spirit clear, Else would I blame you for it. He who did Retrieve the ruined fortunes of thy House, And gave you power to sooth or to redress The woes of thousands round youâpower which ought To be the sweeter, since yourself have felt The very ills that ask your aidanceâHe, I say, my lord, deserves more gratitude Than such complaint implies. LORD CLIFFORD. O true, most true. Yet must I feel that I am all unfitâ From natural disposition, and the want Of artificial polishâfor the sphere My fortune threw me into. I believe That what the Boy has been, the Man will be; And I was, as a boy, contemplative, Not prone to active sports. I was the childâ But let me check myself; for of my nature 'Tis the weak pointâto prattle of the past, Of things, perchance the listener nothing cares for, Perchance hath heard before. PRIOR. Never to me Did aught your lordship talked of, come unwelcome. I love to hear old memories, recitals Of passages, long gone, but called, as 'twere, Up from th'abyss of time, and hallowed by The light of fond Remembrance. LORD CLIFFORD. Then art thou Fit to be listener when the aged speak. âI was the child of war and of misfortune; Born in a castle, suckled in the camp, And thence transferredâwhen Ruin found my sire, And would have found his son, that Clifford's name Might only gild the pastâtransferred for safety, To secret places in the west. PRIOR. Unknown To those about you? LORD CLIFFORD. Ay, and to myself. For the few gleams my youthful memory kept Of prouder days, soon vanished; and I deemed Myself the peasant boy that others thought me. PRIOR. Your lady-mother died. LORD CLIFFORD. Yes, died before I was of age to be intrusted with The dangerous secret of my noble birth; But not before I was of age to learn The faith my fathers cherished. Oft she read, And wept the while, the blessed page that tells Of God's sojourn with mortals. PRIOR. Well for you, That the first knowledge of that Book was taught By lips so pure as hers! You might have else Erred, by interpreting the sacred word In other ways than Holy Church permits Her children to believe. LORD CLIFFORD (crossing himself). Jesu be thanked! I keep the faith. At three score years and ten It were too late to re-examine points Of controversy. These another race May sift and battle forâas signs abroad Seem to prognosticate they will. PRIOR. Saints grant It may be well for Rome! 'Twas but last night, I dreamt I saw my own fair Priory, The beautiful House in which our fathers worshipped, Doomed, pillaged, desecrated! Nay, I saw Until the Ivy mantled every arch, And waved from every window-shaft, and things Obscene and nameless crawled and twisted, where The holy Altar now is dim with light! And I heard men, that walked about, and said 'Twas a just retribution for the waste And wickedness that long had revelled there. And some named meâme, Richard Moone, with curses, And some with pity, as the last that ruled As Prior within its walls.âSt Mary, guard The shrine thou lovest!âPardon me, my lord; This weakness but delays your narrative. LORD CLIFFORD. My dreams are of the mountains, where my youth Did pass so happily, in sweet communion With Natureâunacquainted with all pomp, Except her own, when Night brought out the starsâ [Enter a Servant. SERVANT. My lord, Earl Percy. [Exit Servant. LORD CLIFFORD. Thank your fortune, sir, Your trial's past. [Enter the Earl of Northumberland. A thousand welcomes, lord, To Barden Tower! Your lordship's willing servant, The Prior of Bolton. NORTHUMBERLAND. That sum quadrupled In thanks to both! [To Lord Clifford. Time hath laid on your lordship A gentle hand since last we met. By heaven, Did the Scot muster for another fight, Thou wouldst bear arms as stoutly as you did On Flodden Field. LORD CLIFFORD. Your lordship's pleased to flatter. But thanks to Heaven, my age keeps green.âAnd you, Time hath not passed you without adding strength And manly bulk to the fair slender frame I saw five years ago. Please you, be seated. NORTHUMBERLAND. I crave your pardons both. My business asks Your private ear, my lord. LORD CLIFFORD. I am your servant. My friend will find amusement from these shelves Till our return. [Exeunt Lords. [As the Prior takes down a volume the scene closes. SCENE II. A wood near Barden Tower. Enter Ladies Margaret and Emma, with Cathleen. LADY MARGARET. 'Tis strange. Two days have passed, and yet he comes not! O! love's impatience ought to shame the lightning As slow and cold!âBut one thing I have sworn, That come he soon, or come he never more, I will not wed this man, whom my good brother Would kindly substitute for him I love! Cathleenâ CATHLEEN. My lady. LADY MARGARET. How fares Roddam? CATHLEEN. Well. He doth recover as by miracle; But loss of blood hath made him weak. LADY MARGARET. Brave Youth! I would I were a Queen for Roddam's sake. CATHLEEN. I shall be glad to tell him of your wish, And he be proud to hear of it. LADY MARGARET. Cathleen, You know the song of Duncan? I bethink me How the old Minstrel's tears mixed with his harp-strings As he did sing itâgiving what to me Appeared a playful, not a sad farewell, An air of sorrow and of prophecy.â Just now, methinks, 'twould please me well to hear it. CATHLEEN. Would that my power to please were like my wish! [Sings. Away, Lady, fly from thy dark native mountains, Thy mead-bordered streams, and thy heather-fringed fountains, From the depth of thy glens, from the sweep of thy valleys, Where the warrior treads, and the deer-hunter sallies; Away, Lady, fly! but vale, mountain, and river May sweep, tower, and flowâand be thine again never! O, thoughtless and light beats the heart in thy bosomâ But thine eye is the diamond, thy cheek is the blossom, Thy form is the seraph's, all grace and all lightness, The charm of thy spirit around thee is brightness,â And young eyes may gaze, and young bosoms may quiver, Affections may change, and return to us never! 'Tis done!â'Mid the dazzle of bliss and of splendor, Still fewer and fainter the musingsâthough tenderâ That waft back thy soul to the land of thy childhood, Where mountain and meadow, where river and wildwood, And thousands of hearts throbbing fondly as ever, Lament thee away to be ours againânever! LADY MARGARET. Hark! Mingled not with Cathleen's voice some strain Of doleful note? Or grow I superstitious Since Gordale's gloomy hour? LADY EMMA (looking out). You heard aright. There cometh now a funeral-train, who bear A coffin decked with garlands. Maidens young, Arrayed in white, support the bier. Some comrade They take to her last home, I doubt not.âHush! Again they raise the hymn. Step we aside, Until the sad procession passes by. [Exeunt. [Enter a Funeral. A coffin with the name of Fanny Ashton engraven on the lid, is carried slowly on the stage, followed by Cuthbert Ashton, his Wife, and mourners; Cuthbert leaning on a staff. The Bearers set down the coffin, while the following lines are sung. HYMN. When the storm calleth Wildly and loudly, Then the flower falleth That blossomed so proudlyâ Earth to its earth we bring, Solemnly, slowly! Soul to its God, we sing, Happy and holy! Dare not to blame herâ Lifeless she lieth! Tenderly name herâ Early she dieth! Dust to its narrow cell, Narrow and lowly! Soul with its Maker dwell, Happy and holy! [During the Hymn a Stranger, muffled, comes forward, places his hand on the coffin, and stands in an attitude of grief. Cuthbert and his Wife appear to notice him, and to converse earnestly aside. At length Cuthbert raises his staff and speaksâ CUTHBERT. Avaunt there, villain! or beware the vengeance Of a despairing fatherâfather? No! I was a father. Curses lightâ STRANGER. Old man, Curse not. It 'vails not. It is curse enough To feel what now I feel. CUTHBERT. Dost thou repent? Then God forgive theeâasâIâdo! [Weeps. STRANGER. Amen! And when thou seest my features, thou wilt know, That I am able, not to heal thy woes, But, it may be, to soften them. [Shows his face to Cuthbert. Exclaim not! I would not these should know me for the wretch I must appear to them, if known. [Takes his arm. Good Cuthbert, Permit I prop thy steps, who have, alas! Ta'en their sweet prop away. I have sad right To be a Mourner here! CUTHBERT. (greatly agitated). This is too much! [The funeral moves on, and as the last of the train disappear, re-enter the Ladies. LADY MARGARET. Ever the sameâO noble, noble youth! LADY EMMA. Who hath your admiration! LADY MARGARET. Saw you not? What else was there to look at? Who but he Dared play that part?âToo happy Fanny Ashton, Thus mourned by him! 'Twere sweet, methinks, to die, To have his tears shed o'er one!âEvery drop Is worth a kingdom! LADY EMMA. If so rich his tear. What were his smile worth? LADY MARGARET. Worth the world! And if There should be such a cloud upon his life As may forbid me to enjoy that smile, I'll live upon its memory, and die When the sweet light shall vanish! LADY EMMA. That will turn On your opinion of his rival, who, They say, is handsome. LADY MARGARET. Emma, not a word, I do beseech you, speak to me of him. I ought not hate a man I never saw; But, as a vapour that doth come between My sun and me, I hate him; or at least I wish him from my atmosphere. CATHLEEN (to LADY MARGARET). So please you, I see my lord, your brother, on the path, And hastening hitherward. LADY MARGARET. He comes to lead us Into the court. Away, and let us meet him. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A court of Justice. On the bench sits Lord Clifford with Fenwick, Grey, Swinburne, Orde, &amp;c. and Roddam. A number of the Outlaws chained together; beside them Harman Trueman. Behind the prisoners stand D'Eston and Farrand with the principal gentry of Craven. Earl Percy and the Ladies enter and take their places on the bench. The proceedings appear to have gone on for some time. LORD CLIFFORD. These men are ignorant; were wont to be Good, honest villagers; and had of vice Nothing beyond their class. 'Tis clear as day, That they have been misledâmisled by whom? That must be scrutinised.âBut there stands one Whom I should mis-describe, did I put him In the same catalogue with simple clowns. Stand forward, Trueman!âThou art here accused Of leaguing with, abetting, and concealing These men in their bad deeds. What canst thou say In vindication of thy conduct? HOST. Thisâ I keep an open house. LORD CLIFFORD. Ay, that thou dost, An open house for felons. Is't not so? HOST. For honest men, my Lord, if they have cash, But that is seldom; and by this same token, I do believe these honest. When they rub The scores against them from my check-board, then I may esteem them thieves. LORD CLIFFORD. A quibble, man, Which shall not serve you. Thou hast heard the proofâ These men were frequent revellers at thy house. HOST. Ay, marry were they! Oft they drank and late; Would they had paid as often! LORD CLIFFORD. Now, Sir, dare you, Before this court, assert that these men owe Even for one poor gill? HOST. I dare be sworn That they have drunk a thousand, and ne'er paid For one poor drop. Your worship shall be judge If that implies a debt. LORD CLIFFORD. Another quibble. This is a deep knave. But my honest Harman, The question I shall next address to thee, Will make a subterfuge too difficult E'en for thy subtle brain. Art thou not paid For all these men have drunk? HOST. I am, my lord. LORD CLIFFORD. So far 'tis well. Now wilt thou say by whom? HOST. By those that had the cash, my lord; for I, Like all my tribe, do make good customers Pay for the badâin which sense I am paid. LORD CLIFFORD. Unfathomable rascal! But I will Not thus be trifled with. Sir, these men stand Convicted of a series of offences, Gross, unaccountable. At Fountains Abbey, In spite of curse by candle, bell, and book, They drove the brethren forth. Six weeks ago, The men of Gargrave from their night-attack Scarce found the church a sanctuary. Tithes, Ordained for holiest purposes, have been Demanded and receivedâto gild their riot. They fell on my poor servant, Cuthbert Ashton. As their guilt's climax, from the last offence Deaths have resulted; and the penalty Their lives must pay. Now, Harman Trueman, thou, As cognisant beforehand of their guilt, Standest in equal peril. Thou canst yet, However, save thyself, and do good service, By now discovering who enticed them into The course they soon may suffer for. HOST (turning round). Is't so? Then, officer, your gyves! I'll take my place Beside the guilty, and will suffer with them. For never will old Trueman turn informer Against the friends that trusted them! LORD CLIFFORD. The rack Shall tear the secret from thy craft!âRemove him To torture, officers. [Officers seize Trueman. D'ESTON (stepping forward). A moment stay! 'Twill save your lordship's time, and spare you trouble, To clear at once this matter up. These men, Your lordship justly says, are ignorant, And simple, and have been misled. Permit me To earn for them a pardon, by delivering One Leader up to justice. LORD CLIFFORD. Name him, D'Eston. D'ESTON. I am that one. FARRAND (stepping forward). And I another. SEVERAL GENTLEMEN. We Must also plead th'offence, my lord. LORD CLIFFORD. Amazement! The flower of Craven's chivalry thus blighted! RODDAM. By th'Mass, I'm glad on't! Little did I dream That we had such antagonists. In sooth They fought like men; and were it mine t'impose Their penance, I would order that anew They meet us in yon chasm, and fight it out With their good swords! NORTHUMBERLAND (smiling). Peace, Roddam. LORD CLIFFORD. Other measure Must be dealt out to them! It cannot be That human life should fall like autumn leaves Unnoted and unvalued. Gentlemen, The law, that with an equal eye beholds The guilt of rich and poor, or if it leans, Leans on the rich with just severity, As having ampler means to know their dutyâ That law, long set at nought, demandeth now Augmented vengeance. [Enter Henry abruptly. HENRY. Yes; but not on them. Here point your thunder, if the bolt must fall! These have but shared the frolic and the farce, The tragedy o'th'play hath all been mine. I slew young Norton, I beheld the death Of Fanny Ashton. [A pause of astonishment. LORD CLIFFORD (to HENRY). Then, young sirâ LORD FENWICK. One word Permit to me, ere judgment be pronounced. There is a mystery in these transactions Which it were wise to clear. I know that man [Pointing to Henry. I know his honour fair. If he hath ta'en A life, as he confesses, I will pledge My own, that it hath been for worthy cause, And in fair fight. These are not idle words; There is my gageâ [Throws down his gauntlet. I'll prove them on the body Of any that shall dare to take it up! LADY MARGARET. Thanks, noble Fenwick!âI forget myselfâ I only meant to say that I believe ThatâgentlemanâincapableâI pray youâ Lord Clifford! He is innocentâ [Faints. LORD CLIFFORD. Sweet Lady, Would he were worthy of so fair a pleader! Look to her, lords.âThis case we'll further hear In private. Keep the prisoners in charge. And, D'Eston, follow me. [The Court breaks up. SCENE IV. A room in Barden Tower. Enter Northumberland and Henry, slowly, in conversation. NORTHUMBERLAND. I saw it allâyoung blood, that would not move In the dull sluggish current of old age; And enterprise, that would not pause to learn The lessons of a stern economy. And yet the hero who had shivered lance In the âField of the Cloth of Gold,â the play-fellow Of princes, and the favourite of a King, Should hardly have descendedâ HENRY. Hold, my lord, Or I shall think I hear my father chiding. I will amend all that. NORTHUMBERLAND. I doubt it notâ And now of Norton? HENRY. Would he were alive, And here, to answer for himselfâand me! For then I should not be compelled to say What now I'm forced to.âHe was of a House Not, it is true, a rival of our own, But still, from petty causes, oft a thorn In our supremacy. Hence grew ill blood Between us, e'en from boyhood. Rivalriesâ I need not say in whatâembroiled our youth, In which my star still kept th'ascendant. Stung, At length, to madness by imagined wrongs, He challenged me to mortal fight. We fought. He had his lifeâI took it not. Nay more, I did receive him as a friend; I made him Thenceforth my confidant. But there are men To whom a kindness is a burdenâwho Can sooner pardon injury, than a deed Of generosity. To blast my hopes Of union with your House, became a wish And a determination, for the which This Outlaw folly seemed to give him scope. Wild as it was, and rash, his plan appears But little fitted to achieve its object; But Passion doth hide peril, as the mist Conceals the yawning chasm.âNot much remains To tell. Defeated in his mad attempt, And conscious he must answer for itânot To me alone, but to the outraged lawâ By desperation urged, assassin-like, At my unguarded breast he struck. His blow Was intercepted, and, alas! received By one whose story you shall hear. I slew him; 'Tis pity, but 'twas in my own defence. NORTHUMBERLAND. I do believe it; and, if that were needful, Would gladly stand your friend. Come onâ HENRY. Not yet. I go to change this garb. NORTHUMBERLAND. Pray you, what next? Shall it be forester's green, or peasant's gray, Or Outlaw's steel-ringed jerken? HENRY. Good my lord, Mock not! I'll none of them. Remember you A certain Knight that joined your northern stag-hunt? NORTHUMBERLAND. I understand you. Goâand lose no time. [Exit Henry. [Enter Lord Clifford. St George! there have been stirrings here, my lord. I almost could believe me still on th'Border, Where skirmish 'twixt the Suthron and the Scot Creates no marvel. Where hath justice slept? LORD CLIFFORD. In Barden Tower with me, I greatly fear. NORTHUMBERLAND. Bravely confessed. This candour gives me courage To charge your lordship further, as the cause, In some part, of these troubles. LORD CLIFFORD. How! NORTHUMBERLAND. Excuse me. You did deny the meansâ LORD CLIFFORD. What means, my lord? My towers were open, and my tables free. Aught else, sir, a poor Baron like myselfâ NORTHUMBERLAND. Well, well, no more. Broad lands in hill and dale, In chase and greenwood, and perchance some gold That hath not seen the sun of late, will make Fresh drafts on your exchequer needless. Comeâ LORD CLIFFORD. Indeed we're much beholden to your lordship. But why not tell me of the part that 'scape-grace Bore in these doings? NORTHUMBERLAND. I conceived it better To let the hank unravel of itself, At your judicial winding. And I had, Besides, a wish to note the interest Waked in my sister's bosom, for myself; And well your scrutiny did serve that wish. LORD CLIFFORD. Nay, now that was a cruelty, my lord, Which, had I been aware of it, you should not Have had the chance to practise. NORTHUMBERLAND. Tush! my sister Will thank me for it in a week. My brother, That is to be, would thank me for it now, Did he suspect it to be work of mine. [Exeunt. SCENE V. The Library, as before. Ladies Margaret and Emma, with Cathleen, are discovered in earnest conversation (aside) with Grey, Fenwick, and Roddam. To them enter D'Eston, Farrand, &amp;c. from one side, and Lords Percy and Clifford from the other. LORD CLIFFORD (to a SERVANT behind). Bid them dismiss the prisoners. 'Tis just, If we forgive the Head that moved the whole, To save the Hand that was impelled by it. LADY MARGARET (passionately). Then He is safe! LORD CLIFFORD. Lady, I know not that. He hath so far disgraced his name and birth, Dishonoured so his breeding, that my duty Compels me to acquaint his Sovereign with it, And leave him in the royal hand. LADY MARGARET. O! then I pray you, take this ring. It was the gift Of England's lord to my unhappy father; Nor hath it lost its virtue by the passage Through these poor hands. Have it conveyed to him, And should the King be stern, let him produce it,â It may, with Margaret Percy's prayer to aid it, Become a talisman to save him! LORD CLIFFORD. Lady, His penance will be slight, thy zeal befriending. But keep the relic for another suit. The monarch loves my Son, will, for his sake, O'erlook a fault or twoâ LADY MARGARET. O! will he use His influence, and make me his servant ever! LORD CLIFFORD. His Wife, sweet Lady, was't not that you meant? LADY MARGARET. Hear me, Lord Clifford! I have due respect For you; and feel, I trust, sufficient sense Of th'honour you intend me; butâ LORD CLIFFORD (to NORTHUMBERLAND). Odsfish! How's this, my lord? Another trick of thine? Come, come, no more of it. Dear Lady, trust I am not in this business. [To a Servant. Tell my Son To hasten hither. Thou shalt see him, Lady; And then thy mind shall be at liberty To choose or to reject him. [Enter Henry. LADY MARGARET. Brother, this Hath been thy scheme, and Emma, thine, too. Well, I can forgive. HENRY (takes her hand and kneels). Here let me claim thy promise. You see me as âat Linhope's wild cascade, Where the North saw her Chivalry.ââI dare not Repeat the compliment; but here I am, Nor false, nor outlawed, yet a shepherd's son, The son of that good man, a Shepherd once, And my name Henry, to which you may now Add that of Clifford. [Leads her to Lord Clifford. Henry Clifford begs Thy pardon, and thy blessing! NORTHUMBERLAND (leading LADY EMMA to him). Good your lordship, Bestow your blessing here, too. RODDAM (leading CATHLEEN to him). If a page Might dare presume so far, I, too, would ask it. LADY MARGARET. No bolder spirit lives than thine, young Roddam, And honour were your meed in any rank. LORD CLIFFORD. This weakness o'the eyeâwell, well. [To Henry. Young sir, I had roughdrawn a letter, to be laid Before the King, detailing these excesses, Which, now that all's forgiven, I will burn. HENRY. No, keep it, father. Lay it in the archives Of our old House. Perchance a future age May find it, and thence learn, that there was once A Clifford who exemplified the truthâ That 'tis a perilous experiment To raise a LAWLESS POWER, whate'er the end We mean to reach by it. 'Tis a machine Which he who made it, finds hard task to guide; But should he leave it, RASH or WICKED hands May seize the wheels, and urge their speed to Ruin! [To the audience. And now, if our kind judges deign to say That Henry fairly hath acquitted him, The Outlaw and his gallant band will proudly And gratefully pursue their avocations, By nightly levying willing Contributions! THE END.</field>
