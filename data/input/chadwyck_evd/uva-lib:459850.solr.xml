      <field name="fulltext">THE TEMPLE of LOVE: A PASTORAL OPERA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, Spoken by Mr. Booth. Abroad the British Warrior Conquests gains; At home there's Harmony,âGreat ANNA Reigns. The Consort Politic divinely charms; Her Wisdom rules, and willing Skill performs. She gives the Movement with an equal Sway; The Spheres keep Time, applauded, as they play. Such Pow'r, Antipathies can reconcile, And tune the greater World, like her more happy Isle. In spight of War we thus with Peace are blest, And Love alone can here alarm the Breast. Drawn by her Fame, strange Shepherds now repair, In English Words, with soft Venetian Air, To sing their Passion, and beguile your Care. Sure they may please, if Nature set their Song, For Musick is the Universal Tongue. Soft are their Hearts, yet innocent their Thoughts; Then for their Meaning, pray forgive their Faults. Shou'd here the Notes the Turn of Words controul; Words are but Bodies, Musick is the Soul. Tho' in the Voice that double Charm is found, The Harmony of Sense, and Melody of Sound: 'Tis hard to raise, or save, in ev'ry Place, With manly English an Italian Grace. Yet if this bold Attempt you'll kindly spare, What may not then a grateful Spirit dare, To strive to please the Gen'rous, and the Fair?</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Reader is desir'd to take Notice, That the Lines mark'd thus [â] will not be sung, by reason of the Length of the Performance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. The Scene is a woody, fine Country, a Hill in Prospect on which stands the Temple of Love; on one side a Well of Antique Stone-Work; a large Tree on the other. Enter Eurilla with a Basket of Flowers, and a Garland which she is compleating: Thyrsis behind, observing her unseen. Eur Charming Roses, flow'ry Treasures, Sweet and smiling, like the Morn! Hence removing, serve our Pleasures: Swains and Virgins you'll adorn. See, see this lovely Rose! [She takes a Rose. Blushing, it invites me To remove it to my Bosomâ Ah me! it has hurt me. Fair Deluder, awayâ [She flings away the Rose. So Hopes of Pleasure Too often turn to Pain, and Love I'll scorn. Love, like the Rose, is sweet, but sharp his Thorn. Shall I then venture? No, Love might destroy me. Thyr. Try me. Eur. Ah me! some Eccho's nigh me, And answer'd, Try me. Oh! you mistake me. Thyr. Take me. Eur. First take me, Death! Thyr. First take me, Life! Eur. Ah! no, this is no Eccho: I discover, 'Tis but the Voice of some Fool like a Lover. Thyrsis Advances. Thyr. Is't a Folly, Eurilla, sweet Creature, Humbly to beg you'll ease us? Eur. Oh Thyrsis! 'tis your Nature, For your Amusement with your Love to teise us You've pre-ingag'd your Heart; Then prithee leave me, 'Tis Phillis must relieve you. Thyr. Tir'd with denying, I am now Eurilla trying; Less coy I hope to find her; I can be true to Beauty, when 'tis kinder. Eur. Tell me, e'er I approve you, Should I love you; Does a real Passion move you? Thyr. E'er I change, or make Advances To new Faces, may I die! In delicious, balmy Trances, By your dear enchanting Glances, Ever ravish'd let me lye! E'er I change, &amp;c. Eur. Now all my Doubts are over; Here sit, my tender Lover. Thyr. Oh! happy Moment! Eur. But what alarms you? You trembleâI am told That Love is all a Fire; And yours is cold. Thyr. Eurilla, forgive me, I trembleâ O'ercome with Pleasure, Excess of Blessing, Above Measure, Above Possessing, I die with Joy, and tremble for my Treasure. Eur. I'll ever be Loving, Delight of my Heart. Be you never roving, Your Flame ne'er removing, Like mine, still improving, We never shall part. I'll ever, &amp;c. Still why so silent? Thyr. The Rights a Lover claims, With Silence he must study to deserve. Eur. To so discreet a Swain I'll not deny a Token of my Passion. Thyr. Whatever is mark'd thus (â) is not sung. âMy Love alone can claim it. Eur. âBut then, my Thyrsis, âBe sure none here may see us. Thyr. âWe are secure, and private. Eur. âLook here then. Thyr. âI do. Eur. Sees not my Shepherd? Thyr. What, Fair one? [He looks a while, and rubs his Eyes. Eur. Rub your weak Eyes, poor Thyrsis! Don't you yet see it? Thyr. Where is it? Eur. There, you Fool, you have it. [She hits him a Box on the Ear, and then goes out. Thyrsis alone. Thus does she treat and leave me? Oh! Thyrsis, leave her, Resolve, my Heart, to fly her, as she flies thee, And pay her Scorn with Scorn. Ah! turn thee, turn thee To Phillis, kind, and lovely. She will approve thee. I'll tell her, Oh! love me, She'll answer kindly, I love thee, oh! I love thee. Phillis is heard singing in the Cottage. Phil. Long to love may seem uneasie, But, fond Hearts, what more can please ye, Than the Joy of being true? Thyr. Yonder's Phillis, too believing! Poor mistaken Fair! She relies on Modern Vows. Phil. within. Love revives by fresh Caresses: Each is blest when most he blesses. Like the Morn our Joys renew. Thyr. How lovelier is her Goodness, Than proud Eurilla's Coyness! Phillis advances. Phil. Long to love may seem uneasie; But, fond Hearts, what more can please ye, Than the Joy of being true? Thyr. He's blest, who's lov'd by you. Phil. Thyrsis, my Treasure, I know you love meâ But tell me, gentle Shepherd, Whence this unusual Red Thy Cheek o'er-spreading? Thyr. Is then the Mark remaining? As here Eurilla A flow'ry Garland wove, I stood admiring, And toying among the Flowers: A Bee advancing, Fierce and angry, has stung me. Phil. âTo suck a sweeter Hony, âThe cunning Creatures âDid to the Sweets prefer, âWhich our Meadows bear, âThose on thy Featuresâ Come to our Cottage, Love, To ease thy Anguish, I'll bathe thy Cheek with Milk. Thy Pains asswaging, They soon shall cease their raging. Thyr. The Smart is over; And I a while must leave you. âWith Speed I'm now repairing âTo young Sylvander; âWho's waiting with Impatience. Yet know, where-e'er I go Still here I bear thee; Still, my Dear, my longing Heart Will be near thee. [Exit. Phillis alone. Ne'er leave me more, my Treasure: Charmer, return, or I die. Without thee, Soul of Pleasure, Ah me! Panting, Fainting, Pleasure is flying, Dying. Farewel, Life and Joy! Ne'er leave me, &amp;c. Enter Eurilla with the Garland, a Satyr behind watching. Eur. Take here what has amus'd me! But, to bestow it, [She gives Phillis the Garland. Dear Phillis, where's your Thyrsis. Phil. Not farâyou saw him lately Stung by a Bee, poor Shepherd! Eur. By a Bee! Oh very pretty! Phil. D'you laugh when others suffer? Eur. Pray would you know what Bee, What Bee it was that stung him? Phil. What Bee? [The Satyr, advancing slowly, lays hold on them both. Sat. Pretty Creatures, I'm he. Phil. Ah me! the Satyr. Eur. Let me go, thou horrid Creature. [Eurilla gets from him, and runs out. Sat. One of you now will serve me. Phil. Why do you hold me, My pretty, gentle Satyr? D'you fear I'll go? Sat. I know you always fly me. Phil. Oh now I'll stay; See here these pretty Flowers, This lovely Garland, It is for you 'tis weaving. Sat. And again shall I trust you? Phil. Stay, help me to compleat it. Sat. I'm too good-natur'd. [The Satyr sits whilst Phillis lays the Garland over his Arms, and binds him with it insensibly, pretending to finish it. Phil. As here combining We Flowers entwine, So Love is joining Your Heart and mine. Sat. The Rose with Prickles Gives Joy and Smart; So Beauty trickles, And wounds my Heart. [The Satyr whistles, and several Fauns or Satyrs enter and dance. Phil., Sat. Ah how charming is kind Enjoying! Eas'd of Anguish the jealous must know! On the Grass contented and toying, Courting, Sporting, Love transporting, In an Ocean of Joys we flow. Ah how Charming, &amp;c. [Sat.] Then now you own you love me. Phil. I'll give you strait a Token, Such as you merit, Of my Affection. Sat. Oh give it! Phil. There, my Dear, receive it. [She strikes him with a Brier, pushes him down, and goes out. Satyr alone. Sat. âOh thou very, very Woman! âFirst she allures me, âSecures me, âTies me, âThen down she throws me, and flies me! âI cannot stirâwho'll help me? âWho now will raise me? âAh me! I'm bruis'd and crippled!â âShe has lam'd me, slipt my Shoulder, âAnd spoilt my Shape for ever. âWhat's this strange Moisture âThat's running out? âOh! 'tis my Brains I doubt. âAy, ay, it is my Brain. âWhen e'er with Love we're curst, âThat's sure to run out first. âThe Brain's giv'n over, âWhen e'er you play the Lover. [He gets up at last. If Fate will but free me, False Woman, adieu! If ever you see me Endeavour Your Favour, And Wooing My Ruin, Your worst may ye do. If Fate, &amp;c. Enter Sylvander, descending from the Temple of Love. Syl. Pow'rs Immortal, Fate declaring, End my Sorrow! I'm despairing. Sat. That Fool shall set me free. [Aside. Syl. Still in Darkness to be lying, Still in Pain, is worse than dying. [Going. Sat. Oh stay, dear, pretty Shepherd. âAh me! don't pass me by. âHelp me, help me, gently! [Sylvander comes to him. Set me free, and I'll thank thee. Syl. And who so finely With a Garland has ty'd thee? Sat. I'm the Fool did it. To find again the Nymph I love, who left me, I try'd a while this Magick to relieve me. âTir'd at last with lamenting, âI am repenting, âAnd would dissolve th'Enchantment. Syl. âI shareâ Sat. âShould I but tell thee âThe odd Enchantmentâ Syl. Oh Torment! I've been imploring The Oracle, to find my lost Orinda; But cannot understand it. Sat. What does it tell thee? Syl. Under the Rose, where Myrtles are, [Reads the Oracle. Mark well where Waters rise! There shall a Fire, that dying lyes, Revive, to bless a Pair. Sat. 'Tis easie; Untie me; I'll untie it. Syl. First resolve me! Sat. See here the Myrtles twin'd about the Roses! And under, in the Well, Water's rising. Syl. Oh! witty Satyr! Sat. Unbind me; Then, to Expound the rest, you'll ready find me. Syl. I with Joy set thee free. [Sylvander unbinds him. Sat. Oh! oh! oh! oh!âShe had half choak'd me. Syl. Now ease me, kind Satyr: Explain the rest, and ease me. Sat. Sure I enough have guest. You made me do my best: Guess thou the rest. [Satyr runs out. Sylvander alone. Syl. âMonster, or worse, thou Satyr! âUngrateful and inhuman! â'Twould have been strange âFor thee to have done better. What shall I do? Thyrsis, having been a while behind, advances. Thyr. Sylvander! Syl. My gentle Thyrsis! Thyr. A while behind a Tree I have observ'd thee, And heard thy sad Complaining. Pray, who is this you've lost, Poor Shepherd? Syl. Oh! Thyrsis! Why will you now renew my cruel Pain? Thyr. 'Twill ease you to reveal it. Syl. Ten long Years have I rov'd, since my old Father, With Danger of his Life, sav'd young Orinda's, Rich Montano's Daughter, Hurt by a raving Boar. He stabb'd the Monster. The Parent, kind and grateful, Bestow'd on me the Virgin: And she, but yet an Infant, Was then secur'd to me by sacred Marriage. âBoth only Children, and the tender Hymen âOnly yet taught our Lips, âScarce wean'd from milky Food, âCold childish Kisses. Soon after, young Orinda Was in the Forest lost. Thro' Forests, o'er Mountains, thro' Desarts, and Vallies, Still wand'ring and grieving I've sought her. No more, oh Heav'ns! no more must my Eyes see her, Nor can I, returning To our old grieving Parents, End the doleful Mourning. Thyr. Well may thy Fortune grieve thee. May Heav'n relieve thee! But tell me, Since still our Faces with our Years are changing, May not her Looks deceive thee, While for her thou art ranging? Syl. I hope to know her: For sure the Mark's remaining Near her right Shoulder, Where she was wounded By the Boar in his Fury. Thyr. Such a Mark to discover, That's hid beneath her Gown, I'd ne'er give over. I would try ev'ry Beauty, And briskly play the Rover. But you, chast Lover, Ne'er court the Favour. Syl. Ah me! all my Hopes are over. Thyr. If Love with Hope's expiring, Why then d'you fan the Fire? When the Heart should cease desiring, We ought to change, or retire. If Love, &amp;c. Syl. I'll see a Thousand Beauties, But ne'er Orinda; Or, seeing, I'll not see her. So will my Passion Be but a light Amusement. Despair secures and arms me: My Heart is ever cold, Love never warms me. Love's Fire in my Eyes is shining, But ne'er can reach my Heart. The Fair, in vain designing, Their Power to Love's are joining: A Smile returns a Dart. Love's Fire, &amp;c. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. The SCENE continues. Enter Satyr with the Garland. Sat. I here am come again; I know not why. Within my Breast I swore I here would come no more. Yet still I long to try. Here secret Charms I find; And hither to return I am inclin'd. [He views himself in the Well, and adorns himself with Flowers. I'll now Adorn my Brow: We pretty Creatures, For all our handsom Features, May yet add Charms to Nature's. I'll view my Beauty. Nymphs, look, and languish! Tho' Pride should arm ye, A new Narcissus will charm ye. Oh pretty! the Birds are warbling. [The Birds are heard. Applauding Birds attend me. Oh! Melody, that melts the Soul in Pleasure. How gently, gently, My slumb'ring Sense it doses! My Eyes it closes! Here I down will lay me. So sooth'd by Venus, in her Lap, Love sleeps as I do. [He falls asleep on the Edge of the Well. Diana descends in her Chariot while the Satyr is sleeping. Diana. Sleeping Satyr, wake in Mind! Wanton Love no Ease shall find. Here in Dreams enjoy a Sight Of the Seat of chaste Delight. Leave a Love to Folly join'd, 'Twill deceive thee: Rural Sports will best relieve thee, Wanton Love no Ease shall find. [The Scene changes to Diana's Seat; some of her Attendants enter and dance. Venus and Cupid descend. Venus. Cold Diana! Now I find, Ev'n the Chaste in Dreams are kind. Yet, where-e'er your Court you keep, Love and Pleasure fall asleep. [Diana flies up in her Chariot. Change the Scene, my gentle Boy; Show the Blessings we've in store; Dreams, tho' false, give real Joy, Waking Sense can feel no more. [The Scene changes to the Bower of Bliss; several Lovers and Nymphs enter and dance: Venus and Cupid fly up, and the Scene turns to a Grove again. Enter Eurilla and Phillis. Eur. Mark what I say, my Phillis! This was the Bee [She shows Phillis her Hand. That stung the wanton Thyrsis. Phil. Ah! fickle perjur'd Shepher'd! Eur. While the bold Rover Aim'd at my Lips, I met him with my Hand. Phil. Every Man in Love's a Traitor; All their Courting Is only Sporting, They're intriguing with every Creature, Tho' but you they swear they're Courting. Eur. Then be wise, and give over Love and the Lover. Phil. Hark, hark! [A Bird is heard to sing out of the Tree. Eur. Oh! where? Phil. Yonder, see, Eurilla! Yonder, perch'd o'er his Nest he's singing. Eur. I see itâOh Charmer! Warbling, the Bird's enjoying Sweet Pleasure, free and gay. While we, with Love complying, Our selves to Care are tying, He sings and sports all Day. Phil. The Bird may sing and sport, yet he is loving. A Nymph in Forests roving, Wild like the sport she's loving, May doat on Freedom's Charms. But a fine young Creature, Finds her Pleasure greater, Clasp'd in a Lover's Arms. What can be sweeter? Eur. âOh! [Discovering the Satyr. Phil. âStay, my Dear. Eur. âLet's fly, while he is sleeping. Phil. âNo, no; hear me! âLet's fling him in the Well, to cool his Fury. Eur. âI dare not, my Dear, I dare not. âIf he wakes, woe be to us! Phil. âOh! fear not. âCome, softly, take your Bow, and unstring it. âAnd bind his Feet, while I his Arms am tying. Sat. âI here am come again. [Dreaming. Eur. âPhillis, the Monster hears us. âLet's fly, I pray thee. Phil. âHe's only Dreaming. Eur. âDreaming! no, he knows our Meaning. Phil. âCome, prithee fear not. Eur. âWhat, will you try again then? Sat. âI here would come no moreâ [Dreaming. Phil. âI come no more; let's fly, Eurilla. Eur. âI'm flying. Sat. âAnd hither to returnâ [Dreaming. Phil. âOh! he's Dreaming surely. Eur. âI dare not trust him. Phil. âHelp me; we'll without Danger âMaster the Beastly Creature. Eur. âWould there not be more Safety, âBefore we bind him, a while to blind him? Phil. âThat will do better, lend me a Ribbon. Eur. âThere it is, and a strong one. Phil. âNow tie it. Eur. âHarder. Phil. âHe's waking. Sat. âWho dares tie me? Who's so nigh me? Eur. Ah me! Phil. Ah me! Sat. Pretty Fools are about: [Gropes about, and strives to unkind his Eyes. I'll find you out. Phil. Beastly Satyr. Eur. Ugly Creature! Sat. If I catch yeâ Phil. and Eur. No, Satyr, no, no; no, Satyr, no, no. Sat. âYou thought you had me fast, [Unbinds himself, and looks about him. âBut I'll have you at last. Phil. âOh! I tremble, my dearest, for thee. Eur. âOh! my Treasure, I'm dying for thee. [The Satyr runs from the one side to the other harkening. Sat. âIf I see you stir a Foot, âLittle Gipsies, how I'llâLook to't. Phil. âBeastly Satyr! Eur. âUgly Creature! Sat. âIf I catch yeâ Phil. and Eur. âNo, Satyr, no, no; no, Satyr, no, no. [Eurilla and Phillis run out. Satyr alone. Sat. Why seem they so scornful? What do I see? their Javelins? [Takes up their Javelins. These Spoils shall serve me. With these to yonder Temple I'll goâto Cupid I'll make an Off'ring; And sure at last he'll be propitious To my kind Wishes. The more we fondly run, The more the Game will shun, And Fortune frown. Soft, soft, soft easie Steps with Art Will sooner catch a Heart Than hunting down: Then move on warily, tho' Love is calling. In a Chace, Like a Race, We're often falling. The more, &amp;c. [Exit Satyr. Enter Thyrsis, and then Sylvander, and Eurilla who is looking about the Place. Syl. Thyrsis, what Charmer's this that glads my Eye? Thyr. The best Excuse I know for my late Falshood. Syl. Fair one, what are you seeking? Eur. Only my Dart, and that of my Friend Phillis. Ah! sure that wicked Satyr has remov'd them. Thyr. Eurilla, accept of this I offer. Eur. From thee I will have nothing. Syl. May this be grateful, Tho' from a Stranger! Eur. Much rather; And, as a welcome Favour, gentle Shepherd, I here receive it. Syl. To your prevailing Charms much more I owe. Thyr. âBright Maid, give mine however âTo angry, injur'd Phillis; âAnd say, in pity, that her repenting Shepherd, âOnce wounded by another, âSends this to punish. Eur. âThyrsis, too late repenting, âWill scarce be pardon'd. âNecessity, not Virtue, seems to guide thee; âAnd leaving thy First good Choice âTo gain a Second, âWithout just Reason; âFrom the one and the other âLove should deprive thee. Thyr. Eurilla is too cruel. Syl. Were Cruelty still lasting, And Love ne'er tasting, We then should die with Fasting. Eur. The Contenting of a Lover Worse may prove than being coy; We may lose that on a Rover, That the faithful should enjoy. The Contenting, &amp;c. [Exit. Thyr. Sylvander, go to my Phillis, Appease her, or I despair: Soften with gentle Words, Soften the cruel Fair. Syl. âHope well: When we're repenting, âHeav'n's relenting. Thyr. Gently, gently be complying! Charming Fair, be coy no more! You've by Pain your Power been trying, Pity, pity, and restore. Gently, gently, &amp;c. [Exit Thyr. Sylvander alone. A Charmer, like Eurilla, Strikes not the Eyes alone, But invades the Soul, And will possess it whole. Orinda, returning, Oh! end my Mourning; Or from my Heart Depart. Why should we, when Hope's expiring, Be still desiring? Fond Heart, repine no more! I'll now be gay. Let Hope my Joy restore, Dull Care adjourning; When Grief's returning, I know the Way. Fond Heart, &amp;c. [Exit Sylvander. Enter Satyr, coming out of the Temple drest like a Gypsie, and in a Rage. Sat. Foolish Love, ne'er hope to teize me, If you pain me, Change shall ease me; None but Fools to Inclination, For the Pleasure, bear the Passion, Foolish Love, &amp;c. In vain you hope to starve me; To gain my Wish, this stol'n Disguise shall serve me. [He goes to the Cottage, and knocks at the Door like a Beggar. Good People, pray now see My great Necessity! Bestow your Charity! Pity the Poor! Phil. within. Who's at the Door. [Phillis looks out. Sat. A poor begging Shepherd. I come from Ãgypt, I'm a Fortune-teller; And 'till our Trade was falling 'Twas a good Calling. Now ev'ry Fool's pretending To be a Conjurer, And all the wise are starving. Enter Phillis. Phil. Do you tell Fortunes? Then prithee tell me mine. Sat. Cross my Hand then, and give me yours. Phil. There it is; now pray tell me, Will Fortune never favour, And shall I want for ever A true Lover? Sat. These Lines good Luck discover. Be now but tender-hearted, You'll sweetly be diverted By a pretty Satyr. Phil. Oh! hang him, ugly Creature, Who basely would be catching Young Maids, tho' they are watching On their Duty! Sat. And yet upon thy Beauty This Hour he will be preying. Phil. So you indeed are saying. Sat. And prove it true too. Phil. Hold! Gypsie, hold! Sat. I'm he, and now will have you. Phil. âAh barbarous, inhuman, let me go! Sat. âNay, I have you. Phil. Oh Heav'ns! what mean you? Sat. You'll quickly know it. Phil. âAvoid me. Sat. âIn vain you struggle. Phil. Whither do you drag me? Sat. You ty'd me once; I'll tye you now. Phil. For Pity's sake, my pretty, sweet, dear Satyr. [He drags her to the Tree, and ties her with the Garland. Sat. Oh! now I'm sweet and dear. You'll quickly find What kind of Sweets I've for you. Phil. âWhy do you tie and bind me? Sat. âNow scamper, if you can. Phil. âHelp! Shepherds, save me! âOh Heav'ns! help, quickly, oh Heav'ns! Sat. Lend that Arm, pretty Struggler. Phil. Oh help me! relieve me! Sat. I'll relieve you. Enter Sylvander with a long Dart. Syl. Hold, or thou dy'st, Monster of Lewdness! Sat. What now? Syl. Forbear, or strait I'll kill thee. Phil. Kind Heav'n assists me. Sat. Oh! now I know thy Meaning. Thou com'st about the Riddle. I'll explain thee all the rest, But prithee leave me. Syl. The rest of that Ãnigma! Oh Heav'ns! I must know it. OrindaâPhillisâ [Makes Signs to her. Phil. âSee my Distress, kind Shepherd! âOh Heav'ns! do you forsake me? Syl. âSpeak thou, I'll leave thee. [Makes signs to her, and sits down. Sat. Now leave me, thou Intruder! [Having snatch'd Sylvander's Dart, and pointing it to him. Or with thy Dart I'll ease thee. Syl. Help, help, here! Phil. Help, help, there! Enter Thyrsis also with a Dart, and runs to oppose the Satyr. Thyr. Villain, forbear, and oppose me. Sat. With thee too, Minion! Thyr. With me, perfidious Ruffian. [They fight. Syl. Strike him dead. Phil. Save a Maid. Syl. Pierce his Heart. Phil. Heav'n takes my Part! Sat. What will relieve me? The Satyr retreating falls into the Well. Syl. Down there! Phil. Drown there! Sat. Down, down I go. Thyr. Go to Pluto's Cave below! Syl. Sure he is drowning. Phil. Oh I'm reviving. Syl. Let us unbind the Fair one. [Thyr. and Syl. unbind Phillis. Thyr. âPhillis, Darling of my Wishes. âForgive my Hand, that, fond to free you, âEager and trembling must press thy tender Limbs. Syl. âSure nothing was less worthy such a Partner, âBright Nymph, than such a Tree. Phil. âNow breathe, my Soul; and, Heart, be calmer! Thyr. Bright Shepherdess, now be easie. âLet Rest at home compose you. Phil. I thank thee; And, if no more I love thee, Thyrsis, do not complain. Thyr. âMy Fair!â Syl. âD'you scorn him who has sav'd you? Thyr. âWhat, then you prize not âWhat I have done, mov'd by my Love and Duty? Phil. âFrom Bonds you've eas'd me, âI'm now my own, and free. Thyr. âWhat do you jest, unkindâ Phil. Oh! no, no, no; go, go, prithee go. I'm free; I'm free from thee. Syl. âPoor Thyrsis, here I see âSmall Hopes for thee. Thyr. Part we, my Dear? No, my Treasure, Life of Pleasure, With you my Soul's remaining, More fond than you're disdaining; 'Till pitying and complying, Both Souls to Heav'n are flying. Part we, my Dear, &amp;c. [Exit Thyrsis. Syl. Fair one, Thyrsis is faithful. Eurilla told me.â Phil. No Matter; if I forsake him, Th'Occasion's not Eurilla. Syl. What then can move you? Phil. 'Tis you, Shepherd, are th'Occasion. Syl. I! Phil. You. Syl. What have I done? Phil. Do you not conceive me? Ne'er deceive me: You conceive me. Sure my Eyes have done their part! You perceive it; You believe it, But disdain a proffer'd Heart. [Exit. Silvander alone. â'Tis true I perceive it; âBut must not mind it: âFor Thyrsis loves her: âAnd then Eurilla! Orinda! O Heavens! âA double Love! fatal embitter'd sweet! âWhat will ensue is more a Riddle yet. Guard me from a double Passion, Or a divided Heart! All is due to Inclination; I scorn to give a part. Possest of what I love, May both our Souls combining, Still bind each others Heart. Ah! how long our Hearts are a joining, Yet how soon, when join'd, they can part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. The Scene continues the same. Enter Eurilla with the Dart in her Hand. Eur. âHow Sylvander employs me! âO Heavens! how strangely âMy Heart is now disorder'd! âA Shepherds Favour so proves too often âA cruel kindness. âHis hand has arm'd me; âBut his Eyes disarm'd meâ âBut here he comes. âI'll fly the pleasing danger. Enter Sylvander. Syl. Eurilla stay! oh stay! Why do you fly me? Eur. You, who blame me for flying, First cease pursuing, And attend her who pursues you. Syl. Who pursues me, I care not. Eur. Is Phillis then unworthy thy Affection? Beauteous and Modest, Grac'd with every Perfection? Syl. Phillis is lovely, But Thyrsis claims my Friendship. Eur. Love's blind, and shoots his Darts None e'er regarding: Love's blind, and strikes our Hearts, None e'er regarding. The more We blindly adore, The more rewarding. Syl. But yet the power of Friendship Is more prevailing, Where Honour is not failing. Eur. What if your Thyrsis shou'd the fair despise? Syl. This tender Heart cou'd never be her Prize, For oh! 'tis sacred, Fair One, to your Eyes. Enr. He loves me! [Aside. âResist yet, Heart, if you can. âSylvander I esteem you, âBut must refuse your offer. Syl. âOh tell me why! âWhy do you thus deny me? âFor you alone my lost Love I'm foregoing. Eur. âSylvander is lovely, But Phillis claims my Friendship. Syl. Love's blind, and shoots his Darts, None e'er regarding. Love's blind, and strikes our Hearts, None e'er regarding. The more We blindly adore, The more rewarding. Eur. âBut yet the Power of Friendship âIs more prevailing, âWhere Honour is not failing. Syl. âWhat if your Phillis shou'd my Love despise? Eur. âYour Love she'll ne'er despise. Syl. âBut if she flies? Eur. âNo, she's too wise. Syl. Ah! tell me then to whom you'll give your heart? Oh! strive not to conceal it. Eur. To him too much I feel it. [Aside. To himâwho will not force me to reveal it. Syl. I'm too presumingâFarewel! Eur. Oh! do not leave me. Syl. I cannot go, Tho' I know You will deceive me. Eur. If I ever encline to complying, 'Tis you only may conquer my Heart. But in vain, while in freedom 'tis flying, You pursue it, till Love shoots the Dart. If I ever, &amp;c. [Exit Eur. Sylvander alone. Shall I follow, and without hope be roving? If I must not possess yet, My Heart, ne'er wander. I may yet find Orinda. Lovers for their Harvest staying, Find it slow, and wait with fear. Ripe at last with wise delaying, Golden Days their Toils o'erpaying, Full enjoyments crown their care. Lovers, &amp;c. [Exit Sylvander The Satyr arises out of the Well. Sat. I'm got out of the Water, Half drown'd and freezing. That hole in the Well sav'd me. Ah! what ill Fortune Attends a wanton Rover! Sure 'tis time to give over. âLike me, hot Lovers, âPlunge to the Neck in Water, â'Twill cure Love's Fever. âWhen there an hour you've stood, â'Twill make you feel your Brain, âAnd cool your Blood. Old Rovers, Dull Lovers, Teaze Beauty no more. Still wooing, And suing, In vain you implore. Yet never repine, To chear you take Wine. Drink! Wine ne'er denies The Old and Wise. âWhy shou'd we waste our leisure, âOur best Treasure, âTo bribe them to their Pleasure? âLoves Joy, we find, âQuickly flies, âQuickly dies; âBut Wine still is kind. âImpair'd by loving, âBy Wine improving, âThe best revenge we find âIs wise removing. Who wants any Brains? I've some to sell. To ease Love's Pains A Cure I'll tell. Who wants any Brains? I've some to sell. Will you have any here? Will you have any there, there, there? If a Beauty will not please ye, Fly to Bacchus, he will ease ye. Daily, Gaily, Laughing, Quaffing, Sorrow ceasing, Joy encreasing, If you're for Sport, And the Fair deny, The Bottle you'll court, And Love's Charms defy. [Exit. Enter Phillis from the Temple of Love. Phil. My Pray'rs are answer'd; But Heaven's mysterious. With darkness the Oracle is clouded, Ease me, gentle Cupid, And clear my Doubts. Who can explain your Answer? âHow shall I solve this Riddle? âThe one the Shepherd must not love, âThe other's Wedded. âWho's wedded? Eurilla or Phillis? âI, with Sylvander, âMay now be join'd by Hymen; âAnd in my Bosom âFor him I feel already âA growing kindness. Little Lights, thro' Woods are roving: Tost and wandring so I move; Neither burning yet, nor loving; But the Flame may soon improve. Little Lights, &amp;c. Enter Thyrsis. Thyr. Phillis will you ever fly me? Ever scorn me and deny me? Phil. Cease Thyrsis, cease complaining, And press not for obtaining; First know what Heaven's ordaining. On this Bark, to ease thee, The Oracle of Love I now will trace thee. Thyr. Tell me! what's Cupid's Sentence? Hoping, despairing, Daring, Yet fearing, I wait My Fate. [Phillis writes the Oracle on the Bark of the Elm. Phil. Read it. Enter Eurilla. Eur. Oh! this sight is pleasing. Thyr. Join with me, Eurilla. Let us read together An Oracle of Love, The lovely Phyllis Has on the Tree been tracing. Eur. and Thyr. together reading. The one the Shepherd must not Love, The other's wedded. Eur. The one who must not Love Must be Eurilla. Were I to Love, Yet Hymen ne'er shou'd tye me: I would remove, Lest my Shepherd shou'd fly me. Love droops without desiring, And desire is soon expiring, But when To meet again We are retiring. Were I, &amp;c. Phil. You hear her, Thyrsis, Love droops without desiring: That I may then love thee, Far hence remove thee. Thyr. Ah Cruel! if you're still disdaining, While I'm complaining, And despairing, Why shou'd I wait? My Fate You're now declaring. Phil. Why of Fate are you complaining, Free to love, and free to hate? 'Tis your Will, fond of obtaining, Makes you fawn, tho' I'm disdaining. 'To the Mind we owe our Fate. Why of Fate, &amp;c. Thyr. If Love claims no return, Then blame not when we range, Fools may unminded burn, The Wise, ill us'd, can change. both together. Phil. The False, well us'd, will range, Thyr. The Wise, ill us'd, can change. Thyr. But, alas, can I range, When you my Chains renew? 'Tis a Torment to change, And a Joy to be true. 'Tis a Torment to change. Phil. 'Tis a Pleasure to change. Thyr. And a Joy to be true. Phil. And a Pain to be true. A Sound of Hunting is heard. Enter Sylvander. Sylv. Come, Swain, Cease to Court In vain. There's better sport On the Plain. Enter several Huntsmen, who join in the following Verse. Hark! hark! The Chace is begun, See how they run! How chearful the Cry! How they hollow! How they fly! Follow, follow. Come Swain, &amp;c. [Sylv.] They come, they come! have a care, Eurilla! [A Wild Beast rushes thro' by Eurilla. Eur. Ah me! 'twill kill me. [Eurilla affrighted, sinks into Sylvander's Arms. Syl. Eurilla! I am byâDo not fear. Bless me! she's Swooning. With Fear she's dying. Help, Phillis. [Phillis loosens Eur. Garment, and goes to get Water out of the Well. Help me, Phillis. Phil. Give her more Airâget Water. Syl. Kind Heavens! what do I see? 'Tis she, 'tis my Orinda! My lost, my wedded Love The change of Name no longer can deceive me. See here my Thyrsis. The Marks by which I know her! Thyr. âOh happy Chance! Phil. âOrinda! Oh Heavens! what is he saying: Thyr. âPhillis, oh now be kinder. [Phillis sprinkles some Water out of the Well on her Face. âBoth Riddles are unfolded, âAnd hopes reviving. The one the Shepherd must not love, The other's Wedded. Eur. Ah me! where am I? [Reviving out of her Trance. Syl. Revive, my dear Orinda, For that's your Name. 'Tis you ten long Years I've been seeking. My Heart foreknew it. The Oracle declar'd it, And these Marks confirm it. Marks known e're you were missing, Yet am Infant, Heav'n and your Parents made you mine by Marriage. Eur. Am I then yours! I wou'd not be anothers. Syl. and Eur. O Grasp me, O clasp me; Dear Soul of my Pleasure! [Eur.] My Fairest, My Treasure, My Dearest, My Life! Eur. &amp; Syl. Embracing My Blessing, Complying, Half dying, In love with thee vying, How charming's the Strife! O grasp, &amp;c. Thyr. Phillis, whilst Heaven is joining This happy Pair, Must I alone be pining? Oh forgive me, do not fly me! I Die with Despair, If you deny me. Phil. Since Fate and Love combine, I must be thine. Thyr. O now so much you bless, No words can e'er express Joy in excess. Eur. Come all, ye tender Swains, See Love reward our Pains. How sweet the Blessing! Love charms us ev'ry way: Our Sorrow to repay, There's kind Possessing. Come all, &amp;c. Enter several Shepherds and Shepherdesses, Hunters, and others, who express their Joy by Songs and Dances. Enter a Country Woman, dress'd like a Haymaker. Wom. O! Roger is gone From me like a Knave. I sob, and I hoane, I whinny and rave. Yet why should I hoane, Or whinny or rave, Tho' Roger is gone From me, like a Knave? I care not a Pin, Some other will come, Now's the time to strike in. Enter a Country-Man. Man. Sweet Lass, 'Tis a Comfort to be in your Case. We've both been crost, let's begin again. Both. Now's the time To strike in,âlet's begin againâto strike in. Man.

Hold, you've not yet my Heart: When all is run out I doubt we shall part. Man. No, we never shall part. Wom. Oh! I doubt we shall part. Grand Chorus. Dancing, Sporting, Joy transporting, All applaud you o'er the Plains. For true Pleasure, Peace and Leasure, Courts in vain shall vye with the Swains. [Exeunt Omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. Bradshaw. It mov'd a Critic's Spleen to think how easy 'Tis grown of late, with empty things, to please ye. 'S death, Sirs, cry'd he, 'tis a fine Learned Age, When Trill and Caper share the English Stage. Those who for Music's sake damn'd Words can hear, Sure for good Wine bad Company wou'd bear. The one's endur'd till we have quench'd our Thirst, So for the Music, we excus'd the first, But why with Dulness shou'd we still be curst. At last the Bard was silenc'd by a Beau, How little, Friend, said he, the Town you know, They're all like me, the World's all sound and show. Give that! About fine Thoughts don't keep a pother, We fine Things come but to face one another. With pretty Sights one House cuts t'other down, Start too some fresh Temptation for the Town, Some pretty tender Bud, just newly blown, To sink the Price of those already shown. Set up some famous Singerâof no Fame, And, tho' she's Dutch, Italianize her Name. What tho' the Singing, or the Face affright, Worse Syrens get their Twenty Pounds a Night. Put out Red-Letter'd Bills, and raise your Price, You'll Lure a select Audience in a trice. Let Men, like Devils, clatter in your Skies, Let your Top Ladies condescend to rise. Get some She-Monster some sixteen Foot high, Get some Subscription, tho' you don't know why: Get some fam'd Opera, any how translated, No matter, so the t'other House don't get it. Get Cloaths, tho' the Actors with half-pay dispence. Get Scenes, get Whims, get any thingâbut Sence. Our Author, who stood by, thought this unkind, And, tho' 'tis hard, wou'd strive a way to find, To treat your Ear, yet not disgust your Mind. Too much the English Fair in Wit abound, To bear with Dulness for the sake of Sound. No Foreign Scenes so cheap a Treat admit, And shall we still so poorly think to treat Superior Beauty, and superior Wit? NoâFirst ty'd to Notes, ty'd Hand and Feet, We'll write, To do our Audience and Musician right, Pleas'd with the Rack, so We can raise Delight. FINIS.</field>
