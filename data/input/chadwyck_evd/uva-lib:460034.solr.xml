      <field name="fulltext">THE Double Distress. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE Right Honourable JOHN, Viscount Fitz-Harding, Master of the HORSE to Her Royal Highness, &amp;c. My LORD, Rome, once Mistress of the World, her Nobles govern'd Tributary Nations, the Business and the Fate of Mankind was theirs, yet they found leisure Hours to entertain and encourage Poetry; and the greatest Heroes were the Muses greatest Patrons; nor has their glorious Conquests, nor their stately Monuments, made their Memories so immortal, as the grateful Pens of these they favour'd and protected. This Example of their Indulgence gives me boldness to interrupt your Lordship, whose more important Affairs must engross your Time. And tho' the Comparison will not hold, when I reflect on the Meaness of this Trifle, and the worth of their elaborate Works, yet the Characters agree. Such Greatness of Soul, and such moral Virtues reigned in them, as we now see conspicuous in your Lordship. The Parallel may justly be carry'd on, and the English Court for Politeness and refin'd Gallantry vye with, if not outshine the Roman: In that noble Circle your Lordship hath from your Youth appear'd, and given as well as receiv'd Lustre from thence. There yet remains and Encomium due to our Nobility, exceeding in Sweetness of Temper all foreign Courts, which renders them belov'd by their Inferiors. This Condescension, which blesses distant Admirers, and takes off the Dread of approaching, is in a double Portion posses'd by my Lord Fitz-harding. It is on this I ought to insist, since 'tis on this I depend for a Pardon of this Presumption; tho' I hope it may help to excuse me, when I say, the Play is not wholly mine, because I thought it done and revised by abler Hands, and therefore fitter to lay at your Lordships Feet: The Success answered my Expectation, and this Honour fulfills the Ambition of My LORD, Your Lordships most Humble and most Obedient Servant, Mary Pix.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. A serious Play in this Fantastick Age, Without Ballad or Song upon the Stage, Nor Wit nor Nature now can please alone, When French Jack-pudding so delight the Town: Instruction on the Stage is thrown away, And Jegg does more then charming Dryden say: Our Ancestors without Ragou's or Dance, Fed on plain Beef, and bravely conquer'd France: And Ben and Shakespear lasting Laurels made With Wit alone, and scorn'd their wretched Aid: Tho' our Play without a Villain's out of Fashion. We hope no less to move your tender Passion; Authors have worn so blunt those constant Tools, That nothing is so dull as Knaves and Fools. Why shou'd we paint the Vices of those Elves, That take such care to represent themselves: The Beaux in Person shews himself to all Much better in Side-Boxes and the Mall, In Dress and Mein so singular and vain, In any Nation match him if you can, He is indeed the True-born English Man. Well, we've shew'n all we can to make you easie, Tumblers and Monkeys, on the Stage to please you: If all won't do we must to Treat incline, And Women, rather than be starv'd, will join. 'Tis quickly done, the Racket Walls remain, Give us but only time to shift the Scene, And Presto, we're a Tennis Court again. Yet we'll not of your wisht Applause despair, Since faithful Lovers are again your Care; Again the Tragick Scenes your soft Compassion share. Our modest Muse no Fop nor Ruffian brings; But treats of Heroiens and of sacred things: Be kind, ye Fair, since of the Fair she sings. These Characters are for Examples drest; Brave, like our Nobles, like our Ladies Chast; Tho' not betray'd, pray pity them no less; Like Heaven at last be kind to their Distress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Miss Porter. The Graver Bus'ness of the Day being past, Perhaps you may expect to laugh at last; That Epilogue shall bow, and break a Jest. Faith we would please you in our own Defence, But wish your Pleasures were ally'd to Sense. We wish your Wits would suffer Reformation, That Shrug, Grimace, and Farce were out of Fashion: Satyr, they say, did once become the Stage But now w'have justly damn'd its useless Rage, Since Fools and Knaves are Names unknown in this good Age. This Play does no malicious Stories tell Of Arts by which the Wise buy Stock, and sell. For once be every Vice and Folly safe, Censure shall have no cause to day to laugh: But pray repay the Poet his good Nature, Since 'tis at my Request he spares his Satyr. If notâHe knows such monstrous things of some, Vices scarce known to Old or Modern Rome, That if you damn the Play, let half the Town Look to be publish'd in the next Lampoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Sent by C. V. Faction, the Curse of every free-born State, The People's Darling, and the Prince's Hate, Reigns with Advantage in this froward Age, And with pernicious discontented Rage, Embroils the Court and Town; nay, ev'n the Stage. Statesmen are Born, are Nurst, and bred by Faction, Love, Quarrel, Think, and drink by her Direction. The Citt enjoys her in her vilest Dress, None Courts her more, nor understands her less. Faction in other Men by Wit is bred, To sow Division, asks a thinking Head. Here Money does the want of Wit supply; And those that have not Brains to think, can buy. While Old, and New, contend to rule the Rost, The Venal Corporations follow most, Not who deserves, but who defrays the Cost; Yet ne'er imagine that this mighty bustling Is but to furnish Fools with Tea and Muslin. Sure these two Companies from ours arose, Faction divided first, and made 'em Foes, And want but our Example now to close. Let 'em with us lay hold on the occasion, Was lately given for Reconciliation, He who propos'd for us shall do the same (If they're content to be control'd) for them: 'Twould be a lucky Thought for the Projector, If they should make his Worship a Director. 'Faith, as to us, I think (who e'er he was) He had contriv'd himself a pretty place. None but selected Beauty's here had shone The Choice of all the Fair had been his own. How pleasantly the Man had past his Time! Turk Mahomet had never liv'd like him. If the Reformers of this pious Age Will set up a Seraglio on the Stage, Pray let the Governour, before he come in His Place, be qualify'd to rule the Women. You know how 'tis in Turky; Let the Town Prevent his Pleasure, to secure their own.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene Persepolis. Drums and Trumpets. King Darius, Rheusares, Russus, Officers and Guards. Dar. Bellona rous'd again, our Troops Allarms; Hark! how the Trumpets sound, to Arms, to Arms. Sound lowder Trumpets, beat the thundring Drums, Medea shall tremble now Darius comes. Glory which calls to War, to Conquest calls; Dare they confine a Monarch to his Walls? The Gods, who Sons deny'd to Persia's King, From Strangers unexpected Succours bring, Cleomedon your brave and God-like Son. Rheu. Pour Sir, your Fury on these haughty Medes, War charms, where Fame, and where Cyraxes leads. Medea oppress'd with Arbitrary Sway, Her King affects by Tyranny to rule, Trampling all Laws both Humane and Divine. His Subjects forc'd to leave their native Land, And wretched Allies your Protection Seek, Where Vows are Sacred, and where Oaths are binding, Such is my lost, yet such my happy State. Dar. Speak good Rheusares, how Astiages Fell from such Height of Glory, and in vain Seeks to support it by Tyrannick Sway. Tell thy unequal'd Wrongs, that while I hate The cruel Cause, yet I may bless the Gods That thus ordain'd for mine, for Persia's Safety. Rheu. When proud Astiages the Medean Throne Had mounted Young, all Eyes were fix'd on him; Vast Expectation hung upon his Actions, The Assyrian Princses too, who Beauty brought, And large and fertile Provinces for Dower, By me conducted to his Youthful Arms; The Royal Maid, with every Vertue crown'd, Was made a joyful Offering to his Bed, And the returning Year brought forth a Son, The Hope of Nations, and the glorious Heir Of half our Eastern World. Dar. What King was e'er so happy? Rheu. Yet he contemn'd the Blessings of the Gods; First on the Person of his charming Queen, His Eye soon sated was with Marriage Joys, New Fires straight kindled in his wanton Breast From an ignoble Fair; yet this the Queen With an exemplar Meekness bore. Dar. Ungrateful Monster! Rheu. But as our Lawless Flames are fiercer far, Then those confin'd, and leap o'er Virtues Bounds, Where such mad Guides, as Passion spurr'd by Lust And head strong Wit, let loose the Reins of Power; So e'er the second Birth, the Adulterous King Left the chast Converse of the mournful Queen. Dar. Unhappy Princess! Poor innocent Sacrifice to Falshood! Rheu. In this sad State, neglected now by all, The long afflicted Queen, for Woes are tedious, Expir'd, her wretched Offspring too, as Fame reports, (Scarce seen or talk'd off) most untimely fell, Whether by Poison, or sure working Greif, When seated at the Heart, the Gods alone can tell. Dar. By the eternal Light that early gilds Our Eastern Courts, and glads th'adoring World, 'Tis sad, 'tis wondrous pitiful. Rheu. The Queen in private was interr'd; soon after The King by Philtres charm'd to fatal Love, Hasts to his Nuptials with ambitious Orna, The product of a vile and perfect States-man, Begot when his black Soul was forming Mischeif, And stamp'd with all her Father's Haughtiness, Curst Avarice, and Cunning. Dar. And did Assyria tamely bear A Daughter of the Royal Line thus injur'd? Rheu. No, for a fierce and bloody War ensu'd; But for what hidden Cause, alass! unknown To mortal Search, the much abused Queen Was unreveng'd, and false Astiages Triumph'd, and to compleat their guilty Wishes, The infant Prince soon dropt, none daring to complain: And tho' 'twas evident, Attempts of Poison Were us'd, yet all was husht and all serene; For Orna now gave to the doating King A Royal-Prince, Tygranes call'd, the fierce Young General in the present War. What need I tell my Injuries, the judging World Has seen 'em plain, speaking bold Truths that have Incurr'd the Hate of Orna, and the King. Dar. Injustice sure's the Rule of this bad Man. Stript of thy Principalities, and turn'd A Wanderer, himself he ruines most, In banishing, and giving to his Foes The Virtue and the Valour shou'd defend him. Rheu. Yet unredress'd with Loyalty I bore These Wrongs; at length, my self imprison'd, (My Son and little Daughter Hostages At Court) in Dungeons close confin'd I pass'd The tedious Winters, and the cheerless Summers, Hid from these Eyes, and sunk beneath my Chains. Dar. Oh wretched King! Cruel Astiages! For thou in innocence wert happy. Rheu. Thus quite forgot for long revolving Years Under Oppression's Load, senceless I lay, Till Fame, which pierces deepest Dungeon Walls, The unknown Sound too soon approach'd my Ear, Of Cytheria's and Tygranes Love. Oh Gods! at the curs'd News I quickly rous'd, Shook my vile Chains, and tore my matted Locks; Rather, ye Powers, than such a Match should be, Let me behold the dear and lovely Maid Sunk with her Mother quick beneath the Earth, And all my blooming Hopes forgot. Dar. O wondrous Loyalty to thy dead Queen! And Constancy renown'd, thus to deny Thy Daughter, and despise the Media Crown. But by what wonder scap'd you, here we heard The Prince's Passion to that height was grown, That Death or Cytheria only cou'd A Remedy prescribe; and how, agen Was she recovered by the Median Force? For whom your Son, the brave Cyraxes, makes Excursions daily on the vanquish'd Foes; Who, with their crimson Vitals mourn his Fury, In numerous Heaps of slain. Rheu. That Darling of my Age contriv'd my Freedom, Whilst Fame of great Darius Power and Justice, With a choice few directed here our Refuge; But Gods! e're we had reach'd the blest Asylum, Tygranes, like a Faulcon, wing'd with Love, Did with his Pounces seize the darling Prey. My pious Son, divided in his Care; For striving to defend these Silver Hairs, Lost what I value more, my Cytheria. Dar. My Soul foretells she will again be free; Cleomedon is joyn'd, this Day she's yours; Cleomedon, whose single Valor gave My routed Forces Life, and pull'd fair Victory From Men triumphant in their happy Fortune, And made her perch again upon our drooping Helms. Rheu. From whence Cleomedon, this noble Youth, Whose Praise the Breath of Majesty records? Dar. If by his Deeds his Birth cou'd be divin'd, I shou'd pronounce him sprung from Gods, not Man, Such Glory shines thro' all his gallant Actions; He our Palladium, this Old Man the Giver. [To Rus. You start, Rheusares! Do you know him? Rheu. No, Royal Sir, the Lines of such a Face, The Image gave me of a trusted Friend; But 'tis the Error of my Aged Sight. Rus. Aside.] His Looks speak Anger, Some other time I must unfold my Story. [Drums and Trumpets. Dar. Heark, heark agen, the noble Voice of War Rebounds from Earth, and cuts the yielding Air; They're sounds of Victory; look up Rheusares, See my lov'd Daughter Leamira comes, All conquering Smiles are printed on her Lips, And in her Eyes triumphant Joy appears. Enter Leamira attended. Lea. All Tongues be mute, let none but Leamira The happy Tidings to Darius tell. First bless I Heav'n and you its noblest Image; The pittying Gods have heard my humble Prayers, And giv'n me still new Theams for Praise. Dar. Rise thou best Jewel of Darius Crown, Quickly disclose the Transports of thy Soul. Oh welcome Conquest; I am doubly blest, Thus to subdue, and hear the News from Thee. Lea. As on the Eastern Tow'r I trembling stood, Wrack'd in suspence, yet longing to behold The then most fear'd Event of this great Day, When loe, from far, a shining Troop advanc'd, Whose prancing Steeds, as taught their Master's Joy, Did proudly Neigh, and beat the hollow Ground, Whilst the shrill Trumpets did their Triumph Sound. Dar. I need not ask who led those gallant Succours. Lea. Cyraxes and Cleomedon, those Sons of Fame, Dreadfully glorious seem'd, their distant March; At nearer View, the Scene all gay appear'd, And to our wondring Sight a Goddess came, Her Chariot drawn by twice four Thracian Steeds, Got by the Winds on smooth Pharsalia's Plains, White as the Snow upon the Mountain's Tops, The Emblem of that Innocence they carry'd. Our Jealous Sun his richest Robes put on, As if he fear'd to be by her out-shone. And Cytherea shou'd usurp his Throne. Dar. Hear, hears't thou that Rheusares? Rheu. The Gods are just, and you Imperial Princess, Joy of all Eyes, the Worlds best blooming hope! Whose Royal Breath disdain'd not thus to praise An humble, worthless Maid. For this auspicious News, hear me kind Heav'n! May never any Sound approach the Ear Of this Majestick Fair, which brings less Tides Of Bliss, then she has pour'd on me. Lea. Then follow'd her, which but to her were Foils, The massie Wealth of proud Tygranes Spoils. The next appear'd the Prisoners of the War, The wretchedst Sight of all this Pomp they were, If any so cou'd be in veiw of her. Dar. The long forbearing Gods begin to thunder, Which false Astiages at length shall feel. How much this War by him alone was sought, Those Powers can tell. To save the Blood of Thousands, I stoop'd so low, to give my darling Daughter, A lasting Cement of eternal Peace, To this vile Womans Son. Forgive me Leamira. Lea. O sacred Sir; Darius, King, and Father! Hear what my Wrongs, not stubborn Will provoke; For I have still a Stranger been to Disobedience. Tho' now the haughty Medeans from Euphrates Banks And Babylon's exalted Towers, Have to Persopolis their bloody Standards rear'd, And Ravage made of all those fertile Fields; Nay, shou'd the Gods yet further License grant, And this Imperial Town become their Prey; Let Leamira fall a Sacrifice to death, To death more welcome than Tygranes Bed. Mithras our God be Witness of my vow Rheu. Never to wed Tygranes. Lea. Never Rheusares, ne'er, whilst there are Gods, And Vows are binding. Rheu. Great Princes Royal Fair! That I shou'd urge This Hate, is evident my Wrongs require it. Thus far I wish to see your Vow confirm'd; For ever to renounce his Bed, yet am So just a Friend to Merit, tho' in him: All must allow Tygranes to be Noble; And if his Mother's Faults we judge in him, 'Gainst Virtue we commit a greater Crime. Dar. What generous Man can to an absent Foe Give such a Character as brave Rheusares! Cherish him Leamira, wear him in Thy Heart; such Goodness is a Miracle. Lea. I plant him here, next you my Royal Father: Will you not grace your conquering Soldiers home, Their Triumphs are imperfect till you come. Dar. Place all our Guards before the Palace Gate, Thou with thy Virgins deck the Throne of State; Let the soft Flute, and softer Womens Voice, Silence the Drum, and drown the Trumpets Noise; And let the Temple Gates be open'd wide, Nothing that's Sacred from my People hide. Joys only Reign, whilst Beauty with its Smiles Shall melt the Soldiers Hearts, and soften all their Toils. Lea. My Women in their richest Robes shall shine, Bright as our God that cheers us with his Rayes, And decks with golden Beams his House of Praise; Sing Io PÃ¦an, till the Musick fly, And eccho PÃ¦an's from the vaulted Sky; O sing Cyraxes crown'd with deathless Fame, And sing Cleomedon's more mighty Name. Dar. By Right indeed, thy Father holds his Crown; But to thy Charms It owes this Day's Renown. Valour's the greatest Gift that Heav'n can give, But Beauty's Power alone can make it live; To that we owe all Blessings we partake; And Love and Beauty first the World did make. [Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Enter severally Rheusares and Russus. Rheu. Russus, thro' all the Court I've sought for thee: Hast thou well done, and like a trusted Friend? Did I not straitly charge Cleomedon Shou'd in the Assyrian Court remain, till Fate And I could safely bring him forth. Russ. You did; but Oh, you may as soon command me With these weak Arms to stay a roaring Lion, Or set my Breast against a flowing Ocean, And drive it to its Bounds, as stop great Minds, When Beauty, Fame, and Glory, lead the way: Thro' all th'Assyrian Court the Praises rung Of Leamira's Beauty and Distress; Her Praises and her Sorrows charm'd the Hero. News came, the Medean Prince had broke the Truce, And Ruine brought on Persia, left unguarded; This scarcely told, the fierce Cleomedon Flew swift as Persius to Andromeda, To the Relief of Majesty and Love. Rheu. The Hand of Heav'n is in it, All Foresight is in vain. Russ. He came, and soon as come, he conquer'd. His Valour strait their sinking Forces rais'd, And till Cyraxes, your brave Son, arriv'd, Stood the first Candidate for Fame, unrival'd; But in his Love-sick Eyes, alas, I read The Victor is a Slave to Leamira, And she, who at such distance warm'd, when near, Will set him in a Blaze! Rheu. No more, the Preperations now begin; I hear the solemn Musick this way comes: Let's watch my Daughter, whose rebellious Mind To Prince Tygranes is too much inclin'd; And warn her of a Love she ought to shun, Which, let alone, will to her Ruine run. Of all the Blessings that on Mortals rain, Womans the only Pleasure brings us Pain; Tho' from her Lips the sweets of Hybla flow; Or first, or last, they turn to killing Woe. Fly the soft Sex; the fatal Syrens shun; Th'Flint is not upon the Anvil thrown, But soonest broken on the yeilding Down. Tho' Rocks immure thy Heart, with Virtue joyn'd, And all the Strength, and Courage of Mankind, Woman, loves Plague, infects the noblest Mind. The Scene draws and discovers Darius and Leamira seated on a Throne, with Guards and Attendants. Enter Cleomedon, Cyraxes, and Rheusares attended, who rank themselves on each side the Stage. Cleomedon and Cyraxes Kneel. Cyraxes. Long live Darius; Victory, Renown, And all the shining Trophies Fame can give, Eternally be his. Cleo. On his presuming Foes Light all the Plagues of War, whilst lasting Wreaths Of springing Laurel flourish on his Brow. Dar. Rise my Defenders, valiant Hero's, rise; Share whist I live, a Scepter in my Heart; And, when I dye, my Crowns. Cleo. Dear is the Greatness, gain'd by such a Loss; When e'er you leave this Crown for an Immortal, And the divinest Princess Heav'n e'er form'd, Shall fill the Throne, the Globe's contending Monarchs Shall lay their rich Regalia's at her Feet, Proud of her glorious, universal Sway, And for a Smile, throw all the World away. Cyr. To make the Scene more pleasing to our Hopes, Peace on her Downy Wings, with Joy comes on. The once victorious Medes, by fear dismay'd, Forsook their Camp, and in confusion fled; But their heroick General, who fought Like disappointed Lovers, or Despair, To madness wrought, is heard of now no more. Cleo. If Love's a Fire that kindles noblest Actions, No Warrier doubts but that Cyraxes felt It's mighty Ray, since to his single Arm We owe this happy hour, the Medes their lasting Shame. Cyr. Shou'd I return your Praise, my Fellow-Soldier, 'Twou'd look, as if we both were so agreed, To shuffle to our selves the Game of War, And share alone the Profit and the Praise. But Emulation in Darius Service, Is not a Crime I hope, in your Cyraxes; But see the Effects, the Captives now appear To wait their Doom. The Prisoners pass over the Stage, Two and Two, in the Last Tygranes, disguis'd like a common Soldier; Cytheria, who speaks aside to Tygranes. Cyth. Droop thus your Head, like Flowers press'd down with Storms, [To Tygr. And hide those Eyes that lighten'd on our Foes, Least they perceive a Monarch in Disguise. Dar. To darkest Dungeons with 'em; hence, be gone: There let 'em mourn in heaviest Chains the Wrongs Of their Ambitious King, the proud Astiages, Who practis'd Tortures on my valiant Soldiers, Tho' priviledg'd as Pris'ners of the War. Rheu. Come Cytheria forth; ha! dost thou tremble! And for the Medians shed thy Womans Tears! False Cytheria loves her Father's Foes; And therefore like thy Fellow Slaves appear Kneel to that aweful Throne, where else thoud'st seen The Royal Arms extended to receive thee. Lea. By her bright self the shiningst Form on Earth, they shall; Let haughty Statesmen at a distance treat, My Arms shall raise her to my tender Heart; And while I hold thee thus, my Cytheria, The Crown upon my Father's Head is not So priz'd, as is this Gemm within my Bosom. What Monster, bred beneath the frigid Zone, But wou'd, like me, thus open wide it's Arms, And burn with ardent Fires for her Reception. Shall Persia then for soft Humanity renoun'd, Deny her Pity, lock her panting Breast, Against so mild, against so sweet a Guest. Cyth. The Gods reward the tendrest of her Sex. My Royal Father is renown'd for Pity, No harsh Reproofs from his dear Lips can come; But, like a Sire to her whom most he fondles, His Tears and mild Injunctions flow together. Nor can Rheusares mean such Cruelty, Or Cytheria be ungrateful to the Throne, By which her Brother, and her Father live; Yet such a Ruine dwells upon my Fate, That I must weep for ever, thus for ever weep. Dar. What are thy Griefs? Speak, And if an Emperour, And Lord of Power can give thy Woes some Ease, Conclude this Moment that thy Sorrows cease. Cyth. Was it a God, or did Darius speak? Yet 'tis a Crime to doubt your Royal Word; But, Oh! my bold Petition is so daring, It will, I fear, be judg'd a greater Crime. Lea. Take Courage Cytheria, make thy Request; Thy Freind, the Partner of thy Wishes, joyns thee, And Leamira is not oft deny'd. Cyth. Hear me thus falling at your Royal Feet; I kneel to Leamira, to Rheusares; But to Darius, mighty Lord of all, I kiss the Earth thus low in Adoration. Dar. Rise Cytheria, darling Brightness, rise; For, in this Posture, I'll not hear thee speak. Cyth. And if I rise, I dare not speakâ Those Wretches, Oh those miserable Wretches! Rheu. Daughter! Cyth. Nay, frown not, Sir, Darius does not frown, Spurn me, your wretched Offspring at your Feet, And strike me through, thus lower to the Center, I can indure it, rather than your Frowns. 'Tis for these hopeless Pris'ners Lives I beg; Look on those Objects, Sir, give Sentence then, On that which pale Revenge wou'd blush to see. For me they suffer, and for me they fought; Commanded so, or dye by Martial Law. Their galling Irons now are putting on, Their fearful Groans peirce thro' my tortur'd Ears, Like Winds and Waves to Wretches in a Storm. Why shou'd those Soldiers for their Leader dye? They cannot give to Persia's lofty State, But to my Woes they'll add eternal Weight. Lea. Agen I fly to raise thee from the Earth; For they Request has so divine a Power, It needs no second, and no force does want To move the King, or listening Gods to grant; Darius is too merciful, too brave, So loath to kill, his Attributes to save. A yeilding Pleasure sparkles in his Eye, And Cytheria says, they shall not dye. Rheu. Think Heavenly Princess, how the Persians fell; Think if their angry Ghost's that cry Revenge, Require not such a Sacrifice as this. Astiages was deaf to Pity. Lea. From others Crimes, must we example draw? Darius is no Tyrant, no Rheusares, And thou too good, to have a Thought so cruel. Can Cytheria so in Virtue shine, Which thou canst wantâno, half her Pity's thine. Cyth. Hear great Darius, hear their woeful Cries, And let the joyful Voice of pardon reach 'em. Dar. Ye pleading Angels, ye shall both be heard, Take Cytheria, take my Royal Signet, This from my Hand, and pardon from my Heart. Behold it brings them instant Liberty. Cyth. Oh the good Gods! How shall I bless the King! Let Cherubims to Earth your Praises sing, What's past the reach of Mortals to aspire, And only fit for the Celestial Coyre. With speed I'll fly, like Mercy from your Throne, With precious Life the poor Delinquents Crown; And, when that's o'er, my grateful Task is done. [Ex. Cyth. Cyr. Haste good Adrasta, on thy Life observe her; Cyraxes Happiness depends on thee; In doing this, thou serv'st thy Mistress too. Adras. Doubt not my Care. [Exit Adra. Dar. Lead to the Temple, The Gods attone with Sacrifice of Mercy. Heap all our Altars with rich Incense high, Till thro' the Air the grateful Odours fly, And Hymns, and Praises waft them to the Sky. [Exeunt. Manent Cleomedon and Leamira. Cler. Turn, mighty Princess! Miracle of Goodness! Behold the Man with fruitless Laurels crown'd, Gave others Fetters, yet himself is bound, And 'midst those Slaves, that did his Triumphs wait, Sinks with his Chains at Leamira's Feet. Lea. Why dost thou charm me back with these known sound Why did I loyt'ring stand, and wish to hear? Why are we cheated thus with Dreams of Bliss? Love, at his first Appearance, tempts us on Thro' flow'ry Meads, and never fading Groves; But when advanc'd beyond Retreat, Alass! I fear the gay and flattering Scenes will vanish, And storms of Fate arise to part us ever. Cleo. Is not this Moment, this Auspicious Now, More worth than thousand, thousand Years of hope Yet when I wish, and look to Heaven in vain, When I look up to you, as much above me, Then I despair, and curse my niggard Stars, Then I cou'd let out these Ignoble Streams, This unknown worthless Blood that fills my Veins, That holds a Monarchs Soul in common Clay, A Punishment alass! but justly due, For daring to aspire to Crowns, and you. Lea. Ah cruel Fate! And justly painted blind; For oh! what King can boast such Vertues, Such Courage, Constancy and daring Power, And all the Gifts that Heav'n on Man can shower. So richly fraught thy Soul, and wanting nothing, But empty Titles, which indeed are nothing, Yet thou art wretched; I am wretched too. Cleo. Oh no my Princess, no, what happy Man, What Hero that is styl'd the King of Kings, Whose Sounding Honours burst the very Cheeks Of Fame, wou'd not resign those Airey Trifles For Minutes blest like these? Lea. You merit more Cleomedon than I Can give; your Hand upheld a Tottering State; Your brave Victorious Arm preserv'd us from Inevitable Fate; no longer I a Princess, And good Darius was a King no more; But for your God-like Acts, we were undone; Th'effeminate Persians fled before the Medes Like Women, and like Women fear'd till youâ Cleo. Oh stop, my Angel, this immoderate Praise, Or I shall dye with Shame. Lea. Therefore when I beheld the faithful Passion That spoke your Soul, and trembl'd in your Eyes, I scorn'd to trifle with that noble Heart, But wav'd the nicer Forms my Sex requir'd, And gen'rously return'd you mine; Nor by your Merit only was I won, Th'Impulses too of tendrest Inclination Urg'd my Resolves, conquer'd Loves greatest Foes; Fear, Interest, Reason, and a Father's Power. Cleo. Oh Royal Maid! Most generous Princess! What shall I say, or whither shall I throw me? Down at your Feet, and kiss the sacred Ground Your steps have blest! Alas! 'tis sacred all, And barr'd to Kings, much more to curst Cleomedon. O Princess! Leamira! That's my Theme; My ravish'd Tongue cou'd dwell upon that Name so lov'd, And nought but Leamira sound, O Leamira! Lea. In vain thy Transports poor Cleomedon, In vain we promise future Happiness; I shall be born from thee a Sacrifice. Alass, the wretched Pledge of some State Peace, A Proxey wedded Queen to Pride, and Pow'r, To some unknown, and hated Prince's Bed. Cleo. Sure such Extreams of Bliss and of Despair Must quite destroy and break the little Cords That fasten weary Life, and join To mortal Weakness our immortal Souls, Which Act inspir'd beyond our narrow Frames. When I behold thy Smiles, or when I hear The sweeter Accents of thy charming Voice In melting Raptures drown'd I sink beneath Joys not to be express'd in mortal Language; But when my Fancy shows the hated Image Of Leamira torn from this sad Bosome, Ambition seizing thee, then I cou'd rave, Tearing my self, and like a chafeing Lyon, Spurn the vile Earth, and gnaw it in despair. Lea. Take this Assurance, for we now must part, Not the wide Empires of the flattering Globe, The painted Pleasures which their Glories bring, Not what we fear of Torment underneath; Not even my Father's Curse by me most dreaded, Shall tare thee from my fix'd couragious Soul; Or in my Thoughts towards thee, till death resolv'd, The least Impression make for any other. Cleo. Hear Heavens! and shall Cleomedon do less! Not Cyprus Queen in all her Beauty's Dress, Not the vast Wealth that in the Ocean shines, In Diamond Quarries, or in Golden Mines; Not for the Globe, nor everlasting Sway Of all our Sun does visit in a Day; Not all the Plagues that Tantalus indures, Nor Wracks, nor Fires, not all that Hell procures; Not to be Mars himself, not to be Jove, Shall make me false to Leamira's Love. [Exit severally. SCENE A Prison. Enter Cytheria, Adrasta, and Officer. Offic. By your Description this shou'd be the Man. Within this Cave in sullen Pride he lies, Refusing all the Kindness we have offer'd. Cyth. Y'have seen the Royal Signet of the King. Let the rest wait, whilst I dispatch by this My Orders; then he shall return. Offic. I Obey. Cyth. Adrasta, how I tremble! must my Life Be one continu'd Scene of Woe? My Father and my Brother I have lost, To save a Prince who loves to my undoing. Honour and Gratitude are noble Guests, Too mighty for the narrow Breast of Woman; How shall I follow your unbyass'd Laws, And keep my Virtue stainless? Adra. Cou'd ye but add to it a little Love? The Task wou'd then be not so very hard. Tygranes Loves you, ev'n to madness Loves you. Cyth. Adrasta peace, what hollow whisper pass'd me? Ha! I am shock'd with an unusual Terrour! Where is this most unhappy Prince Tygranes? I dare not but in Whispers call thy Name. Tygra. What heavenly Voice is that whose precious Sound Charms me ev'n in the Regions of Despair; Is't Cytheria that beholds me thus? But 'tis no matter, she dispis'd me ever, When half the World in prospect was Tygranes, Now she can do no more. Cyth. Unjust upbraidings! Did I, O did I for this Withstand a tender Fathers awful Frown? A Brothers Hope, nay, and the Kings Resolve, With Words so pressing, not to be deny'd: My Pray'rs and Tears were usher'd on these Knees; Thy Liberty I gain'd, thine and thy Slaves, All by this Signet pardon'd, all are free. Tygra. Oh glorious Maid! to what an envy'd height Thy grateful Soul aspires! for 'tis not Love, No, that soft Bosom holds a flinty Heart, Which ne'er can harbour Love to curst Tygranes. So didst thou look, when oft beneath thy Feet I lay, concern'd for my Concern; nay when In Agonys of hopeless Fires I burnt, I begg'd, I rav'd, I dy'd, thy gentle Nature Wou'd drop indeed a Tear, thy self unmov'd; No trembling warmth, nor kindling Sighs did follow, Nor blushes on those Cheeks which half gain'd Virgins In pity to their raptur'd Lovers show. Cyth. If 'tis not Love, 'tis such a Friendship That wishes brave Tygranes wondrous well. Go back dear Prince, pursue your Fate no longer, But look on me as a malignant Planet, And seek for Refuge from some happier Star. Tygr. Thou art my better Fate, my only Wish, Th'Ambition of my Soul, and Crown of Virtue. When thy undaunted Brother, like Achilles, Through our Intrenchments broke to bear thee from me, His Aim at thee, what then was my despair! My Father from a rising Ground beheld Me headlong run thro' Groves of pointed Spears, And after the first Onset, gave Command I shou'd withdraw, or be by force restrain'd. The latter us'd, I kill'd the first that stop'd me, And least agen I shou'd be disappointed, Strip'd a dead Soldier of this bloody Coat, And rush'd amidst the foremost Ranks of Persians. How taken then, the angry Gods can tell, My wish I'm sure was Death. Cyth. Fly Prince Tygranes while you're yet unknown; Why shou'd you stay, and pull new Dangers on. [Hollow without. These joyful Shouts without proclaim their Freedom. Hast, mingle with the crow'd, nor seem to Head. Tygr. Oh Cytheria, push me not away, The Road is deep and dark that leads from Thee: My Soul and very Eyes, you carry with you; Can ye deny 'em but to look their last? Cyth. Alass! Tygr. Turn not so soon; I go, but 'tis to bring Fresh Forces down before the Morning Sun. Again thou shalt behold me Victor crown'd, Or hear my Woes and Life are at an end. Cyth. Do'st thou resolve then to renew the War, And all the Treasure of my Soul expose? If a Father, or a Brother's Blood you spill, In murthering them you Cytheria kill. Oh spare my Brother, my Cyraxes spare, Nor let the hatred by your Mother's Rage Begun, fall upon them; for if it doesâ Tygr. Hold! I dread what your unkind Suspect wou'd say, When the least Word from you wou'd stop my Hand, Tho' lifted 'twere against my deadliest Foe. My Mothers Faults are still remembred by you; And Orna's Crimes draw on Tygranes hate; Yes, Cytheria hates me, and the Thought Is worse then Prisons, Infamy, and Shame, They can but gnaw, and prey upon the Mind, Dispairing Love (oh most obdurate!) more, It tares my Heart, and drinks the gushing Gore. Cyth. I do not hate you Prince, the Gods preserve you. Is this a sign of hate, from Chains to free you? To see you 'gainst a Father's strict Commands, To beg your Life with hazard of my own; To leave the shining Court, and seek ye in These ShadesâOf what can ye accuse me? Tygr. Of nothing, no thou art immencely good; But will you add a little more? Will you, O will you but remember poor Tygranes, Tygranes, Wretch, whose every Thought is you? Is that too much? Cyth. I will, But why are ye resolv'd to urge my Fears By this Delay? Adra. Alass my Lord the Prison Doors unbarr: Indeed your Stay will be suspected. Cyth. It will, it will; may all the Gods protect you. Tygr. Oh I am going, Just as the Life does from the Body go, Just as Streams part, which did together flow, With such regret do IâO Pow'rs above! With Pray'rs I beg ye to preserve my Love. How shall I all my wondrous Sorrows tell? How can I speak that killing WordâFarewel? [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE the outer Part of the Temple of the Sun. Enter Cyraxes and Adrasta. Cyrax. The Median Prince Adrasta, what Tygranes! Was it Tygranes that my Sister freed? Adras. I as a Friend and fatal Confident, Heard his firm Vows, and saw his wild despair, When the sad Moment came that parted him From what his Soul held dear. Cyrax. And wast thou a Spectator only? Why didst thou not prevent so damn'd a Treason? Adras. 'Twas your Command most positive and plain, I nothing shou'd oppose, but carefully Observe; if I too nicely have obey'd, Forgive my Zeal. Cyr. Curse on thy Cautious Folly, it has ruin'd me; The King and Kingdom are alike betray'd; And here the charming Murdress comes, with Mien, And Looks so languishing and sweet, as if Her Soul ne're knew Design. Enter Cytheria. My Sisterâ Cyth. Ha! Cyraxes? Cyr. Why start'st thou, as if guilty, at my Sight? Am I to Cytheria grown so terrible? Is there such Horrour in my Looks, or hate in yours? Cyth. Alass, I know not where I am, nor who I see: Well may I start, well may I be afraid, When dear Cyraxes looks with Frowns upon me. Cyr. Stand firm my Heart, that I may charge her home; Come Cytheria, you are much to blame. Cyth. Indeed, lov'd Brother, my most dear Cyraxes Shou'd pity me, not chide his wretched Sister. Cyr. Oh Cytheria thou hast done a Deed, A Deed, I fear, that will to After-Ages, Draw Curses on thy Name and Memory. Cyth. The Gods forbid. Cyr. Oh I have such a Tale to tell thee, That if thy Soul is Woman, or thy Heatt can melt, Will drown thee in repentant Tears for ever; Thy Inconsiderate Act has Persia ruin'd, This cruel Act thy Brothers Joys has blasted, And Ten, Ten Thousand weeping Matrons kill'd And Babes that hung upon their Mothers Breasts. Cyth. Have I done this! Oh do not wrong me, Brother, With such a dreadful Accusation. From Sportive Childhoods blooming Infancy, To these unhappy Years of Anxious Life, My Thoughts are free from any Crime like this. Cyr. Art thou then innocent! Oh that thou wert. Speak fair Destruction, whose Insinuations, By whose curst Charms, and after whose Command, Brok'st thou Tygranes Chains, and in that Freedom, On Persia hast intail'd Consumptive War? Thy Fathers Friend, Protector, best of Kings, Agen must fight for what the Gods once gave him, For his own Crowns, and for the Globe of Earth, The Royal Martyr was ordain'd to rule; By the same right as we enjoy our Vital Air. Cyth. Alas! Cyr. Whilst we Tygranes had, Peace hung upon his Chains, With him we cou'd our own Conditions make: In this vile Act thou'st ruin'd all thy Race, Thy King, thy Country too thou hast destroy'd. 'Twas Love the Cause; 'twas Love, thou Disobedience! Cyth. Forgive me Brother, if thy Soul knows Pity, 'Twas Gratitude alone that urg'd this Rashness, Nor did I dread the fatal Consequence. Cyr. False Cytheria, no, 'twas Love; forgive thee! No, by my Country's, Fathers Woes, and mine, Thou'st greatly wrong'd Cyraxes; say in Media How have I strove to gain thy early Friendship, Beyond indeed a Brother's Care. What Dangers Shun'd I, to plant me in thy modest Bosom? How often hast thou promis'd me, nay, swore No Lover shou'd beguile me, not Tygranes; He was thy Father's Bar, his Curse hung o're thee, And whilst thy Hands unbound, and gave him Freedom, Thy traytorous Arms strait lock'd him to thy Heart. Cyth. 'Tis most unjust; that I did give him Freedom, (May Heaven and you forgive me,) but no more. Cyr. No more! Think how the angry King will bear it, When he shall hear thy Treasons numberless: Think how his Rage will fall upon thee, Perhaps condemn thy beauteous Limbs to Wracks, Thy Life to horrid lingring Torments. Cyth. This Menace touches me the least, my Brother. I have a Soul as large as thine, Cyraxes, And can with Courage bear my own Distress. If I have injur'd others, (which Heav'n forbid) With endless Wailings I repent it! Cyr. Tortures and Death! She can the Wrack indure to free Tygranes; Injur'd! Hast thou not injur'd any? Is there A Reperation to be made for Loss of Life! Such are thy Injuries, most fatal Woman! Cyth. My Lord, my Brother!â Cyr. Methinks I see rang'd Battles, and the War Renew'd, where every lifted Sword gives Death; See the good King, his Helmet off, the Blood In Crimson Streams pour down his aweful Cheeks. Behold thy Father old Rheusares fighting, Cleomedon, Cyraxes too, eternal Woe! Wading in Blood. Hark how the dying Soldiers Send their last Groans to Heav'n for dire Revenge; Hark how their Ghosts with hollow Accents roar, 'Tis Cytheria gives these Wounds, this Gore, And, but for Cytheria, War had been no more. [Cyth. Swoons. Adras. Alass my Lord, she swoons. Cyr. Oh Gods, what have I done? Look up my Sister; My Life, Cyraxes Soul! Adrasta help. Curse on my foolish Rashness, that durst think Her tender Nature cou'd such Shocks indureâ She breaths agen. Oh Cytheria, speak. Cyth. Who calls upon that hated Name? That Monster whom a Brothers Breath condemns? And such a Brother too whom I so lov'd? Cyr. O pity and forgive my headlong Passionâ See at thy Feet the fond Cyraxes kneels. Cyth. Will you be angry then no more? and do You love me still? Cyr. I do, I do, beyond the Powers of Love; Beyond the Charms of Glory, or of Fame, And far beyond a Brothers lambent Flame; 'Tis such a Passion that I dare not name. With such insatiate Raptures Mothers gaze Upon their darling Infants, when they see The smiling Babes from Pangs of Death releiv'd. Oh 'tis above Compare, the Joy and Pain That Cytheria gives her poor Cyraxes. Cyth. But am I guilty then, Of all th'impending Mischiefs you have threatned? Cyr. No, thou art innocent and good, the Child Of Love, and Favourite of Heaven. Thy Words like morning Incense rise, and each Propitious God bends down to hear thy Pray'rs; But Oh, those Wishes must not be Tygranes, Then they shut up their balmy Doors of Bliss, And with their Thunder tear, and Lightning blast thee; For 'tis a Sin too terrible to name. Cyth. Alass what Sin? Cyr. To wed the Son of her who ruin'd all thy Race, To draw a Father's Curse of Disobedience, And kill a Brother who so dearly loves thee. Dost thou not love Cyraxes too? Cyth. Most tenderly. Cyr. And wil't thou never wed Tygranes? Swear it. Cyth. Never, O, never. Cyr. Remember when in Medea's Court we dwelt, How dear we were from Childhood to each other; How charming thou, how fond of thy Cyraxes! And none by me so lov'd as Cytheria. Cyth. The Pleasure comes so fresh in my Remembrance. Cyr. And when with Childish Sports we pass'd the Hours, Thou, midst the Royal Youths didst chuse thy Brother, And still woudst have Cyraxes for thy Partner. And is all this forgottan? Cyth. No, Let me rush into thy Armsâ A Sister may without a Blush do this. [They embrace. Cyr. Oh Cytheria! Cyth. Fly, fly Cyraxes, Cytheria fly; Am I not turn'd a Monster in thy Eye! What change is this my trembling Heart allarms! Starts ev'ry Pulse, and unknown Wishes warms, Kindles my Blood, and with delightful Pains, And killing Pleasure thrills thro' all my Veinsâ Or quit my Vow, or give these Transports o'er; To save thy Sister from Tygranes Power, Strike, strike me dead, or never see me more. [Exeunt severally. Cyth. meets Leamira. Enter Leamira. Lea. Why Cytheria, why this Day in Tears? Why, when I court thee, dost thou fly my Love, And keep thy Bosom shut to Leamira? Cyth. Alass! I am too curst, too greatly wretched, I seek for Shades to vent my Greifs alone, Least my infectious Sorrow shou'd disturb The happiest Princess in the World. Lea. Art thou no better read in Courts, dear Cytheria, To measure Happiness by ontward Pomp? Speak then thy Griefs, and seek the Gods with me, For to that End this holy Place I visit, In hopes to find Repose. Cyth. That I do fondly cover such a Friendship Is plain, when I unlock my Breast to you. I who have long a Stranger been to Royal Favours. My Mother I ne'er saw, or not remember, Snatch'd from my Father in my Infancy; The Ward, or rather Prisoner of a jealous Queen, Whose Fury still survey'd me with unchang'd And harsh Severity to childish Errors, Unmov'd with all my dutious Service. Lea. Poor Cytheria! cruel Orna! Cyth. Sure under this hard Usage I had dy'd, Unknowing future Ills, but for Cyraxes, He prov'd a tender loving Brother to me, Fondled my Youth, and chear'd my daily Sorrows; And when I wept, wou'd kiss away the Tears, Watch'd like a Lover's Care, still striving With most unwearied Diligence to please. Lea. 'Twas nobly done, he was the best of Brothers. Proceed, dear Cytheria, let us now With mutual Confidence our Loves cement. Cyth. I wou'd not hide, since you'l vouchsafe to hear The inmost Secrets of my troubled Breast. In my unthinking Bloom, Tygranes most Unhappy Fate led him to love this Wretch, And my Repulses more increas'd his Flame, Yet he persu'd me still, with all the Marks Of an unfeign'd and virtuous Passion. This added to my Persecution most, And th'Indignation of the furious Queen, Knew no Bounds, Oh Gods! what did I suffer From her continu'd Wrath, and Womans Spleen! 'Twere strange to tell you, And with Approbious Terms rank'd with the vilest. Lea. Ambitious Woman! what Princess of the East But thee cou'd so adorn the Medean Throne? Fair Sufferer! Cyraxes still was your Support. Cyth. He was, but still against Tygranes pleaded; He begg'd, conjur'd, and rag'd when e'er he heard Me name his Love, and bid me curse the Sound. Lea. From whence proceeded that? there's something in it, Or sure, it look'd like Jealousy! Cyth. It did; but oh the Gods protect Cyraxes From such a Crime, and me from lawless Love. But still remains the horrour of my Fate, For nothing I'll disguise, tho' the Remembrance My Sences racks, and shocks my trembling Frame. Lea. Ha, from thy Cheeks the blushing Roses fly, And charming Red thy lovely Lips forsake. Cyth. On Medea's Verge there lives a holy Hermit, A hundred Years his Eyes have watch'd the Sun, Seen what their ruling Stars on Mortals bring, Seen their Effects, and whence their Causes spring. His Cave cut deep beneath a bending Rock, Proof against Winds and ev'ry Thunders shock: Close by his Cell a Christal Fountain breaks, His heav'nly Thoughts with trilling Murmurs wakes, And Nature's Thirst with rich Contentment slakes. Skins were his Cloathing, Dates his ouly Food, Such as he gather'd from the neighbouring Wood. His Mind, his Garb, and little Store were One, His Pillow Turf, his Bed a Mossey-Stone; The rest he had, were like his Wishes, small, Such was his Wealth, and such his humble All; His Looks and Mein an aweful Reverence show, And his white Beard outvyes the Mountain Snow. Lea. Oh Gods! Methinks I now behold him. Cyth. Thither Adrasta and my self repair'd, Rack'd with tormenting Pains, the worst is Doubt. We met him at the Entrance of his Cave; The good old Man with steadfast Eyes beheld me, And starting on a suddain, Daughter, cry'd, The Gods preserve thee: Frighted at the Sound, I kneeling ask'd the reverent Bard, from what? From Incest, Child, his Voice elated, Shun a too charming Brother; and said, He had Commission then to speak no more, Nor cou'd we with Intreaties urge him on. Lea. 'Tis strange, 'tis wondrous strange my Friend, And needs must make ye dread Cyraxes. Cyth. Rather, ye Gods, let me Tygranes meet, Tygranes! rather wed me to my Grave; Drag me to wants, to misery, despair, Kill me this Moment, blast this vital Air, E'er I forget Cyraxes to beware. Lea. And poor Cyraxes knows not ought of this? Cyth. No, I wou'd not give his Thoughts so black a Scene, He has too good Idea's; this great Princess, Is the sad Summ of all my fatal Fears, This the Anxiety that barr'd me from The Bliss which in your Bosom Reigns. Lea. Oh no; Love here has fix'd his aweful Throne, Can I be well when such a Foe's within! To pay the Trust which you so frankly gave, Know to Cleomedon this Breast's a Slave. Some other time the Story shall be thine. Now lets ascend the Temple's sacred Steps, And from the Tripos know our future Dooms. See Cytheria, all appears divineâ See from the Roofâ A thousand gilded Suns their Rayes decline, And brazen Doors on golden Hinges shine; The Floor with Adamants so richly lay'd, None but the God himself did ever tread. Behold the Altar smoaks, the Priestess comes, And Clouds the shining Dome with richest Gums; Load the pure Altars with rich Spices freight, Till the Shrine bends beneath the precious wait. The Scene opens, shows the Temple of the Sun, several Piramids of Light. Priests attending the high Priest. High Pr. Hail beauteous Princess! hail most Royal pair! Speak your Demands, for this great solemn Day, Princes and People, all are free to ask. Lea. Most holy Father! Inquiring to the righteous Gods we come, And bend to know our Loves eternal Doom. Cyth. Bound to their Wills, we ever wish to tread In virtues Paths, and be by Virtue lead. High Pr. Place your selves here; In aweful Silence wait their just Decree; Joyn your assistance in th'imploring Hymn To great Apollo and his Oracle; But, till his Will is known, all quit the Temple, Save these alone, who at the Altar wait; Here from the Trypos read the Book of Fate. Hymn to Apollo. Solemn Musick. Antick Dances. After which the High Priest speaks. High Pr. Away, away whom I commanded, All; The rest upon the outward Pavement fall, And humbly listen to the Word of Power. The mighty Influence begins its dawn; Your Destiny's are seal'd, your Lots are drawn, As fierce as when he drives the Night from Day, And chases Darkness from his rising Ray. Help me to Mount now, now alass, I see The angry Gods immutable Decree. He ascends the Tripos. The Oracle. âThy Brother Cytheria seek to shun, âYeilding to him, you both must be undone. Cyth. Agen that Caution! See Madam, see, my lost Estate. Lea. 'Tis well, you'r warn'd. High Pr. Hear Leamira, Persia's Princess, hear. The Oracle. âThe Man whom you to death adore, âCleomedon, must be no more; âThe Medean Prince your Charms possess, âAnd in that union, Wars shall cease. Lea. 'Tis false, nor Gods nor Men shall thus ordain. Come near, unhappy Augur of all Ills, And listen to my Vows. Durst thou, thou Priest! Pronounce my Lover's Fate, and live to hope, By vain Predicts, to alter my Resolves? I'll prove it false, falshood and foul Deceit. Eternal War shall Reign, e'er that shall be, Thy Oracle shall cease and be no more, That dust proclaim my Heroes Death. The Medean Prince! Scorpions and Serpents rather. Hear; louder then your Oracles I'll read, And with dire Curses blast what you've decreed. The Temple darken'd. Thunder. High Pr. Hold Princess, hold, do not the God prophane; Till now you were accounted mild and good; Do not so rashly forfeit all those Blessings. The angry Gods drown your rebellious Voice In Peals of Thunder. [Thunder. Cyth. The Skies with Horrour warn us to forbear; Darkness and Terrour spread the Temple round, The mourning Spheres with heavy Motions rowl, And Groans of Thunder fly from Pole to Pole. Heark, how those Clouds like Globes in peices tore, Big with their Birth of Vengeance, how they roar, And scatter all the Prodiges they bore. [Trumpts. Heark how again the warlike Trumpets sound, Hear their loud Voice by louder Thunder's down'd! Lea. What mean the warring Elements? Alass! Why is all this Commotion? High Pr. My Royal Daughterâ Lea. Forgive me, Sir, I will no more presume To fathom what is fathomless, Nor fix my Eyes too steadfastly on Fate, Lest I for ever lose my daring Sight. I nothing will resolve, nor seek to know, But what is cheifly in my Power, That is to die. High Pr. See all agen is bright, and all serene; There's nothing Cloudy but your noble Mind. Be patient and submit. [Temple closes. Drums and Trumpets. Cyth. Alas! the Drums and daring Trumpets sound, Still louder, still they fresh Alarms giveâ Oh Leamira! what are now my Fears? Enter Cleomedon. Lea. Behold the noble Warriour comes, Oh Gods! Have ye decreed I shall no more behold him? Can I indure that thought without Relapse! Cleo. The routed Medes down to our very Towers New Squadrons bring, fresh Troops begirt our Walls, Tygranes like a Fury leads 'em on, And proud Defiance at our Gates proclaims, Threatens to race the City to the Ground, Unless we send himâO, too precious Ransome! This Captive Maid, a Victim to his Bed. Cyth. Oh blasting News! Am I the Cause of War? From the bless'd sight of Day, let me be born, By Lightning blasted, and by Thunder torn, Or sacrific'd in both the Army's view, E'er they for me their bloody Fights renew. Beneath Darius Feet this Wretch shall fall, By Death or Ruine, to attone for all. [Exit Cyth. Lea. Poor Cytheria, more unhappy I! How are we every way pursu'd by Fate! Cleo. What means my Princess? Bliss of my Soul, and Darling of my Wishes! Why is that ominous Sorrow in thy Eyes? Thy alter'd Voice now flaggs its warbling Note, That late, more gladly then the Trumpet, call'd Cleomedon to fight, thy Hand hung on this Sword a Gemm Rich as Andromache had given to Hector, And Venus when she sent her God to Battel. Lea. I dare not tell what happen'd in these Walls, No tho' to Death, the sounding Trumpet calls. Why must I fear? There's yet a Chance in War; Some pittying God the cast of Fate may bar; For Priests and Oracles, let come what will, To cheat us, have a double Meaning still. Like Mars, my Hero is for Conquest warm, Awful, yet lovly, thus your Foes you charm. Cleo. Am I then dear to thee? Ye Pow'rs above! Have I the Heav'n of Leamira's Love? For me, for me do you this Passion own; Plung'd in vast Floods of flowing Joys, I drown, My ravish'd Thoughts in heights of transports rowl, The swelling Tides run o'er my working Soul. Lea. Why ith' rude Camp must ye in Armour shine? The Trumpets Voice delights you more than mine. Cleo. Oh say not so, thou Charmer of my Eyes In thee alone my wish'd for Blessing lies, Beyond all Freedom still your Chains I prize. I go to fight, you know my Fair, I do, I go to Conquer, and 'tis all for you. 'Tis for your Sake I suffer martial Toyls, And 'tis to you I'll offer all my Spoils. You shall alone be Goddess of the War, They needs must vanquish, on whose side you are. Lea. Fly to the Battle, then to Conquest fly, Cleomedon shan't stay, nor shall he dye. May all the Stars sheild ye from Fortune's Harms, And grant the wish'd for Conquest to your Arms. May they protect ye from each lifted Sword, And may the God of War by you ador'd, May he himself be Guardian to my Lord. May you triumphant with your Trophies ride, With fetter'd Princes at your Chariots side; Like the young Mars may you victorious be, Nor be subdu'dâ Cleo. But by that Venus, Thee. Lea. Great as that chief in the PhlegrÃ¦an Fields, When with his nodding Plumes his Sword he wields. Now, now methinks I see the Forces meet, And bloody Chiefs their cruel Anger whet. They strike; hark, hark, the Strokes, their Sounds renew: Now, now they fly; and now again pursue. Oh Heavens! my Love, my Life, they follow you. Now my Heart fails me, and you must not go; Against whole Armies what can single Valour do? Cleo. Ha! Am I then by those dear Lips decreed, To fall ignobly, and on Racks to bleed? Lea. Lost in my Thoughts, I knew not what I said, My Love was present, but my Reason fled; I like some Usurer must trust my Store, Big with the Hopes to have it quickly more; Now, Oh ye Medeans, this strict Charge I give, Save him, Oh Gods, by whose sole Life I breath; From his lov'd Breast turn every threatning Death. Cleo. Glory, the Darling Mistress of our Souls, All-conquering Love with stubborn Power controuls. Farewell, alass! 'tis with excessive Pain I speak it o're, and bid farewell again. Lea. Remember this, (if I have Power to charm) To be secur'd against the smallest Harm; If the least Wound shou'd be receiv'd by you, Your Leamira will be wounded too. Adieu, my Lord, my Love! Cleo. My life adieu. [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE the Camp. Enter Darius, Cleomedon, Cyraxes, their Swords drawn. Drums and Trumpets. Dar. I'm once more King, once more with Conquest Crown'd, By brave Cyraxes, and Cleomedon renown'd: You are my Pillars, you my Scepter's Pride; By Heav'n, I am immortal by your sideâ I'll charge agen, my utmost Fate I'll try, Conquer, or fall, as Monarchs ought to die. I will my self the foremost Squadrons lead: Yes, proud, invading, haughty injurious Mede; I'll meet you all, I'll meet and dash you dead. Cleo. Oh Sacred Sir, half of the World is yours; And to your Glory more, this Day is ours: 'Tis Madness now, not Valour makes resistance. Retire most Royal Sir, for Persia's Love, For Leamira's Sake from Dangers move. Cyr. Leave it to me and brave Cleomedon, To glean the Harvest you so well begun. Tygranes onlyâ Some odd Battalions Heads, that routed were; Him will I seek, and end this barbarous War, Or else my Life. Dar. Had proud Astiages been beat before, By such brave Courage and resistless Power, Unjustly then he had not this Invasion made; Yet you my Hero, sav'd th'ambitious King, When he beneath our trampling Coursers bled; He else had been, like all his Wishes dead Cleo. The divine Majesty which Guards a Crown, Something so sacred threaten'd from his brow, That when my Arm was darting Vengeance down, His awful Visage strook me trembling thro'; Therefore I gave him Life. Dar. And Liberty Cleomedon. Cleo. True, Royal Sir, but to redeem that Fault, I'll find him in the midst of all his Guards, And bring him bound, disrob'd of Royalty, Beneath your Feet. Agen the Charge renewsâ Go back great Emperour, from Dangers free, And from Persepolis our Conquest see. Cyr. The number of the Slain so spread the Feild, There is no Passage this way to be found; Your March into the Western Gate is clear, Hast, Royal Sir, and make your entrance there. Dar. Pursue to Conquest noble Youths, your Claims, And what a King can give, shall crown your Names. [Exit Darius and Guards. Cyr. What shall I call thee, Royal, tho' Unknown? For sure thy gallant Deeds deserve a Crown. 'Tis you Cleomedon must end the War, And Medea shall no more your Courage dare; We've only now to fight with those that fled, The King and Prince, but scatter'd Forces lead. To Medea's Monarch bear thy Soldiers on, Whilst I, with mine, attack his valiant Son. Cleo. My curdling Blood is aw'd within my Veins; Is't that his Royal Mass is so divine? Or is't because I am asham'd of mine? Be't what it will, we will for Fight prepare, In spite of all the Demons of the Air; He is Cyraxes, Leamira's Foe, That is the Word wou'd Hercules o'erthrow. [Exeunt. Charge sounded. Enter Tygranes pursuing Soldiers that fly. Tyg. Ah Cowards, Villains, Traytors! Dare ye fly, And leave your King to shameful Bonds expos'd? Turn Fellow-Soldiers, turn, 'tis I, Tygranes calls: By the dread Fear of Shame, if you have any, Rescue your King and save your Prince from Ruineâ Nothing will do! Curses o'ertake ye then, And all the ignominious Deaths you shun. Am I then left alone? Abandon'd quite! Can nothing poor Tygranes save but Flight? Then back, and fall like Hector in the Fight. Re-enter Cyraxes. Cyr. Stay gallant Foe, thou stir'st this way no farther. Tyg. Say, who art thou, that dares a Fury stop? Wou'd thou were worthy of a Death from me, I want a nobler Foe, the foremost of The Fieldâknow then I am Tygranes. Cyraxes. I catch the Sound with Joy; The only Name I hate, pleases me now. Dost thou not know Cyraxes? Him thou wou'dst not know; I thought, that Hatred first begun at Court, Cou'd ne'er in Camps be patient, or forgotten. To vex thee more, I'll sound my Name aloud, That Hills may Eccho back to thee, Cyraxes. Tygr. I know thee now, And well remember thy ungovern'd rage, In Medea most ungovern'd, and unjust, Because I lov'd the beautious Cytheria; But for thy Sisters Sake, and her Command, Were all the World the Price of this our single Combat, And were I sure the Conquest wou'd be mine, I wou'd not lift my Sword against Cyraxes. Cyr. Poor, and precarious, hide thee then Under some vile disguise as thou didst lately, Till sav'd by Treach'ry; now thou'st princely Plumes, Look'st like Achilles or some valiant Leader, And shoud'st maintain the Character. Tygr. Oh Gods, must I bear this! There was a Reason, Love gave me that Disguise. Cyr. Love! Love! To whom? Tyr. Need I pronounce her Name? I thought I need not say, 'twas Cytheria. Cyr. Yes, that I may be sure to do you Justice, And curse your meeting Flames; let this provoke you: Know, whilst Cyraxes lives, Tygers and Hinds, The Wolf and harmless Lamb shall fold together; Fire burn with Water, Light and Darkness mix, All Nature's Contraries in Peace shall join, Before Tygranes shall my Sister wed. Tygr. 'Tis well thou shar'st the Blood of Cytheria; What is Tygranes Crime, but Love of her? Speak, wherefore? Do not think 'tis Fear, But 'tis for that dear Maid, in Heat of Battle, In midst of Madness and of wild Dispair, I towards thee am calm. Cyr. Then to awake thy drowzy Courage, know 'Tis for that Sisters Sake that I wou'd kill thee. Tygr. Ha! nothing cou'd provoke like this! Then like Astrea I'll unsheath my Sword, And cut off such a Viper from the Earth. Cyr. I'm fix'd like you, my Soul as great, My Mind's as Royal. Tygr. No more, but let our Swords dispute. [They fight. Enter Rheusares and Soldiers. Rheu. Cyraxes with Tygranes, ha! In single Combat when the Foe expects you? Strike down their Swords. Tygr. Is this well done, and like thy boasted Valour? Cyr. Softly, no more; Beneath the Bent of yonder rising Hill, I will again expect the brave Tygranes, And thou shalt yeild thy Cytheria to me. Tygr. Art thou assur'd I shall? Cyr. You shall. Tygr. There I'll not fail to meet thee. I have already bended much too low, Too low for Monarchs, even for Wrongs to bend; But if I stoop'd 'twas but to bound more high. Cyr. Enough, go on, I follow thee [Exit Tygr. and Cyraxes. Rheu. With speed o'ertake 'em, and prevent their Fighting, And with a Guard of Soldiers seize Tygranes. [Exeunt Soldiers. Enter Russus. Rheu. Oh, Sir, most brave Rheusares! Medea is no more. Is not our Vengeance yet to be appeas'd? She is my Country, Sir, and tho' my Friendship Is ty'd to you; yet Love to that surmounts Alas! Astiagesâ Rheu. What of him? Rus. Is taken by Cleomedon. Orna tho' cruel, claims your Pity too, Who with Impatience wing'd, and tender Love, Amidst ten thousand Points of Darts and Javelins, Sought for the Darling of her Soul, Tygranes. When she beheld the Slaughter of the Field, (Her Husband and her Son suppos'd both slain) Tearing her Locks, with wild Despair she cry'd, I'll watch the Event of Hopes or Fate no more, Wars I'll foment no more, Ambition court no more, Leave the blind World to Fortunes blinder sway, And Night and Woes, for everlasting Day. This said, she took the Royal Ponyard, which Our Queens still wear, and stuck it in her Breast. Rheu. Is Orna dead! Then comes the very Crisis of our Fate. Fly to Cleomedon and these Dispatches bear, Which next my Bosom, I for Years have worn; Do thou, my faithful Evidence, unfold The dear Records that in this Breast are written, Whilst I at glad Persepolis prepare A lasting Peace. Rus. I go my Lord, and may th'Auspicious Gods With crown'd Success your just Designs reward. [Exeunt severally. SCENE, the Palace. Overtures of Victory Enter Leamira, Cytheria, and Adrasta severally. Lea. O Cytheria, whither shall I fly? These Sounds of Victory are Death to me: My Father Triumphs in his Daughter's ruine, Cleomedon is slain, or he wou'd be the first Shou'd bring the Palm of Victory and Peace, And lay the Crown at Leamira's Feet. Cyth. Madam; be comforted, Cleomdon's so brave He can't be kill'd your; Hero is Immortal, His awful Visage Death it self dispowers, A common Fate can never reach him. Lea. Oh no, he's slain, my working Soul divines The fatal Shrine, the Oracle takes Place; The Medean Prince is hither brought in Bonds; He will be freed, Reasons of State prevail, And I am doom'd to joyn the Cords of Peace. Like most unhappy Princes we must wed, And to our loathed Aversion must comply, Tho' each for ever curse the Nuptial Tye, And all the poysonous Politicks that rul'd. Oh Cytheria, how accurst am I! No Eye to pity me, no Friend to help, But thou, and Oh! 'tis greatly in thy Power. For all besides will bless the fatal Union, And pray the Gods to grant it, Oh Cytheria! Cyth. You call upon my Name so tenderly, And view me with such kind and fix'd Regards, I feel your Sorrows darting thro' my Heart. Oh that the pittying Gods wou'd grant me Power, But equal to my Wishes and your Wants. Lea. Ha! If there were such Friendship in a Woman! If I cou'd e'er deserve such wondrous Proofs, I then wou'd tell, 'tis only thou canst save me. Cyth. Speak, I conjure you, for your Sake, and mine, I'm wrack'd with an Impatience till I hear it. Lea. You shall wed Tygranes. Cyth. Ha! Lea. And that way disappoint our rigged Fates. Cyth. What said you! Lea. Why starts my Friend? Is this your vow'd Assistance? Nor think dear Madam, tis a loose resolve, A fond proposal, not well weigh'd with Reason; I grant it difficult, and dangerous, But then forget not what the God denounc'd; Think of Cyraxes Power, when he shall come, With Plumes of Victory, to dazle Virtue. Cyth. Alas! our Loves are pure as vestal Flames. Lea. Think of Tygranes constant Passion rather. O Cytheria! Take thou this Council, hoard it as Divine; 'Tis happier far to give thy self to him, To the fond Man who loves to Adoration, Who ev'ry Hour new Charms in thee will find, Than choosing one, whom most your Soul admires, Still striving, tho' alass! in vain, to please, Growing too soon dispis'd. Cyth. Ah Royal Madam! Into what a Lab'rinth D'you lead my Mind, without a Clew to guide? Tygranes now's in Fetters bound, and I A Stranger watch'd, and frighted ev'n to madness. Lea. There is no other time; To morrow may our fatal Ruines bring. The Officers that Guard Tygranes, are At my Devotion, and by lucky Chance, The Sygnet yet remains within my Power, And all things shall be order'd as you please. Cyth. It was my Fathers dire, and last Commands, My dearest Brothers awful Warning too, That I shou'd not Tygranes Wed. Lea. That is your Brother's Love, that shou'd be shun'd, And therefore ought to hurry you the sooner. Cyth. But if Cleomedon is dead, what boots it then? Lea. Were our malicious Fates in this prevented, I yet shou'd hope he might agen be rais'd. Cyth. Why wou'd you tempt a Wretch to Disobedience; An angry Father's Frowns are in my View, And poor Cyraxes Tears have drown'd my way. Lea. How Cytheria! Does thy Brother stop thee? Think how such thoughts thy Christal Virtue stains; Think what the reverend Brachman said with Horrour; Beware the Crime of Incestâdoes it start you! Remember great Apollo from the Altar, How did his awful Shrine with Terrour blaze, The frighted Elements in Darkness mourn, The Temple on it's massy Pillars shake, And thee and I, and all were struck with Horrour, When the dread God in Thunder did denounce, The cruel Woes that urg'd this gentle Caution! Fly a too charming Brother. Cyth. O my rack'd Heart! my Soul, my Mind! what shall I do? Lea. O shun the hated Sound; far be't from thee, What e'er thy Father and thy Brother mean, 'Tis safer to obey the Gods then Men. Think of all these; if nothing else can move, Think of the Horrour of Incestuous Love. Cyth. Whirlwinds first snatch me to the dismal Straund, Where hoary Mountains guard the Snowy Land, There fix'd, till I a frozen Statue be, A mark of Woe to all that burn like me. Lea. Think too thou sav'st thy Friend, thy Leamira, Her Vow's already past, her Wishes fix'd; Destruction and Despair at once will seize me, When I shall give my Hand to one I love notâ O, save a Prince, and help a wretched Princess. Cyth. Both to your self and Prince Tygranes too, I owe a larger Score of Gratitude, Than all your Cytheria's Wealth can pay; Tell me dear Princess, shew me strait the way; Both Heav'n and you I'm ready to obey. Lea. A little Orotory joining my Apartment, For my Devotion, private I have built; One only winking Lamp, with gloomy Light Does endless burnâTygranes will I free, And him will send disguis'd in Priestly Robes, Whilst there, another Priest performs the Nuptials, Then hursht in Silence, and in Darkness veil'd, Nought but the Morning Beams shall find the Bride, And catch thee blushing by Tygranes side. Cyth. Now 'tis so near, my aking Heart forbids, There's something in Tygranes too that awes me, In all his Charms, in all his Looks I read, It is the only thing I shou'd not do; But Heav'n and Leamira says I must. Lea. Tygranes best can plead a Lover's Cause, I'll send him hither strait, if he prevails, In this Alcove let him remain conceal'd. Come to these Arms, my Cheeks shall hide thy Blushes; My Bosom throbs to give its Sorrows vent, And thine too pants the Language of Consent. Give to a wretched Prince thy trembling hand, His Love is Innocent, thy Brother's stain'd, And Virtuous Deeds both Hell and Fate Command. [Exit Leamira. Cyth. O my Adrasta, whither am I going? Thus, like a dying Wretch, twixt Hope and Fear, I leap into the Dark, and know not where. What Friend, what Comfort have I now to help me? My darling Brother I no more must see, Never from hence his tender Accents hear, Nor charming Sounds that hung upon his Lips; Ne'er hear an aged Father's Groans, nor see The Tears that stain his Silver Beard for thee. [Trumpets Sound. Adra. Hark, hark, Cyraxes, Trumpets nearer sound; Cyth. Help me, Adrasta, lift me from the Ground, Quick, quick Tygranes, snatch me to thy Arms, And save me from a fatal Brothers Charms, Scatter these Fires, my burning Breast asswage, Ah save me from an angry Father's Rage, Save me from Death, from Ruine and the Grave, From Hell, from Incest, Cytheria saveâ See where he comes. [Going off meets Tygranes. Tygr. Why am I bandied thus about the World, The sport of Chance, the very Ball of Fate, Tost too and fro' by Fortunes guidy Hand, Still I pursue that beautious Phantom there, And catch, in vain, at the deluding Air. In that bright form dwells all that's tender all that's sweet, Inspiring Love, inspiring soft Desires, Yet with that wondrous Brightness, wondrous All, The Gods and thou too are my Foes. Cyth. Oh Tygranes! Tygr. Stands there a Wretch upon the Virge of Life, Shiv'ring like me, pursu'd so close by Fate, And dares not plunge? No, the most abject Slave, Loaded with Cares, and bending with his Fears, Sinks down the Precipice of ragged Death, And dare not I then? Wherefore do I live? Oh Cytheria! I will tell thee why; Because the Pleasure of beholding thee, Exceeds the Pains for all that I have lost. Cyth. No more, Tygranes. Tygr. She weeps! My Sufferings melt th'obdurate Maid! Cyth. Hear then ye heav'nly Arbiters of Justice! What I will do to recompence this Truth, Tho' under most severe and strict Commands, Vow'd Promises, to those that are thy Foes, Charm'd by no Power but Gratitude alone, Hear thou Tygranes, in the midst of Chains, Disrob'd of all that's Royal, but thy Virtues, Ev'n in this loath'd Captivity I seek thee, And give thee Cytheria for Reward, Who ne'er can bless thee equal to thy Merits. Tygr. Love, Life, and Soul! Speak yet agen; is this my dreaded Fate! Where am I? whither, whither am I fall'n? Is this the Precipice! can this be Death? Shall I not rise to Empire, rise to Love! Mount the aspiring top of Glory's Height, And never never think of Sorrows more? Cyth. Yet hold Tygranes, pardon that I stop thee, Stay thy fierce Wishes in their full Carrier. Another way there is, equally grateful. And suiting better with our wretched Fortunes, That is, to dye with thee, and in the Grave Mingle our Fragrant Ashes with the Dead, Sweeter than Flowers that strew the Nuptial Bed. Tygr. 'Tis done, and I am sunk agen in Death. Oh most unconquer'd hate! most cruel Breath! O I cou'd curse my Fate and tear the Ground Till the kind Earth receive me in her Womb. And give her Son and all his Woes a Tomb. Cyth. Live, live Tygranes, I am only yours; Quick, quickly take, and lead me to the Priest. What is more dreadful, worse then a relapse! Tygr. Can you ye Powers with patient Eyes behold A bliss too great to be in Raptures told! What Man like me, Oh Gods, was e'er so blest! When, where and how, speak Angel, speak the rest. Cyth. I'm chill'd with horror when I wou'd proceed. Tygr. Oh 'tis the softness of thy Virgin Fears; Think how these long long Years I've dy'd for thee, Give me the last convincing tender Proof, Yeild the consenting Blessing with that balmy Breath; Pronounce my Joys, give me this Night thy Hand; Dangers and Death surround me then in vain, To thee and Life I am restor'd again. By this dear Extasie of Joy I'll prove Long Rigour but indears possessing Love. Cyth. My word you have already. Thus, with a trembling Heart, I give my Hand. [Giving her Hand, a Voice under ground. âHold Cytheria, hold. Cyth. Save me Adrasta; O Tygranes, save me. Did ye not hear a mournful Voice, as from The silent Tomb, cry'd Hold? Tygr. A Trick, a Dream. What babling Demon has to do with us? Are we not Innocent! secure from guilt? Cyth. It was my Father's, or Cyraxes Voice. Tygr. In spite of all thy Race, I'll catch thee thus, Thus clasp, thus hold thee to my Heart; Nor Earth nor Hell shall ever dare to part us. [They Embrace. Oh how this Scene of Bliss transports my Soul! This Hand, these Lips are mine without Controul. How fragrant is the Breath of yeilding Joyes! How soft the Syllables that Crowns the Voice! Cyth. Allow me Sir one hour for Devotion, And I will meet my LordâAdrasta go before. [Adra. aside.] Mean while I'll hasten to inform Rheusares. [Voice.] Stay Cytheria. [Exit Adra. Cyth. Where am I going? Oh my Lord support me. Tygr. Thy Cares, thy Fears be mineâbanish'd this Breast, Here, let 'em sleep in thy Tygranes Bosom. Look up my Soul, my Life! give me one Word. Thus, against all thy Foes, I draw my Sword. Rheusares come, Cyraxes too, nay more, Come old Darius with thy Persian Pow'r, With Love in this, and Fate in th'other Hand, I'll guard my Venus o'er the Boystrous Strand; Thus Mars himself did, mounted on a Star, Defend his Goddess from the Titans War; Not all the World shall force thee from my Side, When this dear Hand the Nuptial Knot has ty'd, [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Enter Cytheria leaning on Adrasta. Cyth. Rage, War, and Horror now seem pass'd away, And all with chearful Looks salute the Day; The tuneful Larks in airy Dances fly To their own Voice, beneath the Silver Sky; A gawdy shew of Life and Pomp we frame, And all, alas! is but a tedious Dream; A fleeting Shadow of imperfect Joys, Which the first waking Thought too soon destroys. Adra. Why Madam, make you this so sad Reflection now? Cyth. E're the first Dawn of Light or blushing Morn, Before the Sun left Thetis in her Bower, My Lord forsook me, scarce awake from Bliss; Soft were his Words, and few he said at parting; Took from my Hand a Ring, and left me This In lieu, and as a Pledge of his return: Heav'n's choicest Blessing guard him till he comes; For I must learn to Love, and to Obey him. Adra. Madam, your Brother comes this way. Cyth. Oh let me fly him, and Rheusares too, This lovely Basilick, this aweful Lyon, That curles and shakes his angry Looks at me, And lead me to that utmost Verge of Earth, Where stands a Cliff as deep as Heav'n from from Hell, And push me down the Precipice to Death. Nothing to my distracted Soul appears So terrible as these indearing Names, Father and Brother. Enter Cyraxes. Cyrax. I wou'd intreat a Word with Cytheria; For I have most Important News. Cyth. My Lord; my Brother! Cyr. No, thou art now no more my Sister, Cyraxes is thy Brother now no more. Cyth. Pronounce not so my Lord, indeed you are. Cyr. Indeed I am not, wou'd not for the Globe, Be in my Blood so near ally'd to thine. Cyth. Forgive me, for I find my Crime you know; I own, it's Aggravation of my Sin, To call you Brother, or Rheusares Father. Cyr. What woud'st thou call me, Cytheria? Cyth. All that is softest, dearest to my Soul; All that I value with the tender'st Love. Cyr. No, thou woud'st call me then Tygranes. Cyth. Oh, Sir, if you are yet my Brother, If you have any Tenderness lodg'd in ye; Hear me, a Suppliant, kneeling at your Feet. [kneels. Cyr. What is thy Guilt? What can deserve this Posture? Rise Cytheria, rise, and speak thy Wishes. Cyth. No, never, never, till you've promis'd Pardon, Nay more, to save me and protect me. Cyr. I will, I promise thee I will. Cyth. And yet there is another wants your Pity, My Husbandâ Cyr. Thy Husband! Ha! what Husband! Cyth. Oh spare your dreadful Anger; For both much want your Mercy. Oh Tygranes! Cyr. Tygranes! and thy Husband! 'tis impossible. Beware, Oh Cytheria! take good heedâ Cyth. All Warning's now too late; 'tis done, 'tis past, This fatal Night by strange Predictions led, I disobey'd the kindest best of Fathers, And what is worse, Cyraxes have deceiv'd. But Heav'n and all yon Powers wou'd have it so. Cyr. I will not, must not, can't believe thee. Cyth. Indeed 'tis true. What Bolts of Terrours do you cast upon me, In that dire threatning look! Oh hear me, Sir, Be still a Brother to me, sooth my Sorrows; For I have many to complain of stillâ Cyr. Art thou prepar'd for Death? Cyth. Ha! Cyr. For Death, I say? Cyth. Had I not in my Disobedience sinn'd, How happy had I dy'd! Cyr. Dost thou repent thy Crime? Cyth. O pardon me, And I will wast my Anxious Life in Tears To wash the guilt away. Cyr. Enoughârise Madam, from my Soul, I do forgive thee, Forgive in all you have offended me, But when your Father hears what you have done, He will not be appeas'd. Cyth. He will my, Lord; Oh he's too good, too mild, Tho' harsh to the unjust, I know him well, I know the way to soften his Resentments, And melt him into Kindness; he will pity, And rather blame the Cause, then Cytheria. If you wou'd but forgive your wretched Sister, Rheusares will be reconcil'd. Cyr. Rheusares, nor my self are kin to thee. The Medean Prince, 'tis he's indeed thy Brother. Cyth. My Lord! Cyr. He is thy Brother. Cyth. Ah what say you? My Husband and my Brother! Cyr. Most true. Thou art the Daughter of Astiages, And he the Father of Tygranes. Cyth. And I his Sister! Cyr. Believe me, for my Proof is plain. Cyth. O miserable me! Oh cruel Oracle! more cruel Gods! To lead me to that Fate I wou'd have shunn'd. O Father wretched, Daughter most accursed! Relation fatal! O unhappy Son! O ruin'd Brother! Sister forlorn and lost! Husband unbless'd! O thrice abandon'd Wife! Cyr. Poor Cytheria! call to thy remembrance, How from thy harmless Childhood, still I charg'd thee, Rheusares too, with all his dread Commands, To shun Tygranes Love; there was a Cause Which thou too soon has feltâthink Cytheria. Cyth. Let me ne're think agen. Confusion and Distraction choak my Thoughts, And turn my BrainâThen you are not my Brother? 'Tis the last Word that Cytheria begs. Cyr. Indeed I am not. Cyth. Horror, Distruction, Madness, and Despair! Light, Health, and Air forsake me; Rain and Sun, For ever lock your Hoard from Cytheria; Let Mildews blast, and Lightning's flaming Sword Pierce thro' my Veins, and drink my Vital Blood. Throw all your Magazin of Thunder on me, Crush me to Earth, or strike me to the Center, And shut this horrid Wretch from Day for ever. Cyr. Be comforted. Cyth. Alas, 'tis now too late. I once was Blest, and heard thy gentle Cautions Fall from thy Lips like Drops of Hybla's Hony; Yet I wou'd on, and rush to horrid Incestâ O miserable Wretch! most vile of Women! Cruel Cyraxes! Brother now no more, Strip me at least of this curst Royalty, And if thy Words cannot, let thy kind Sword Bring ease to this afflicted Creature. Cyr. I dare not, Truth I fear will kill thee. Cyth. Alas! thou canst no moreâI'll hear the worst, Without one Groan or Sigh. Cyr. The Royal Princess of th'Assyrian Blood, Soon after thy unhappy Birth expir'd; But e're she dy'd, she to my Mother gave thee, First stamping on thy tender Arm a Lyon, Th'undoubted Sign of Royal Medea's Race; Then to my Parent's Care wer't thou committed, An Oath first taken, with this Trust was joyn'd, Ne're to discover thee while Orna liv'd: Orna now dead, by her own violent Hand, I hither came to glad thee with the News. Cyth. Am I not patient, silent as these Tears That trickle down, and blubbering, drown my Speech. Cyth. Had I obey'd, I had been still most happy. While Maids are Innocent, they must be bless'd; But I am black, deform'd, and monstrous now. What has one Night produc'd! Cyr. Cease, Cytheria, give thy Wailings o'er, No more thy Brother, yet I'm still thy Friend, And love thee still with Fondness. Cyth. Breath not the least, tho' but Imperfect Sound Of Comfort to my Soul. Forbear the Name Of Friend or Father now; who is a Friend to Woes? Cyr. I can no longer hold; look up, sweet Virtue, The Storm is husht, and all's serene agen. Cyth. Cruel Cyraxes, No happy Days, no Sun can shine on me; A Cloud of Woe Surrounds me from all Parts. What Hopes can can sooth so vile a Wretch as I! A Brother and a Father I have lost; A Brother and a Father found; no Matter. It is not well, Adrasta, that you know. Adra. Alas, too late I doâHelp Heav'n! Cyr. Hear me, Cytheria. Cyth. Heav'n had no Hand in it, that's certain; But I to death will go, there's no Distinction, No difference of the Sex, no Incest there; When in her Shrowd poor Cytheria lies, All pale and wan, no Voice her Praise will sing, No Brother will seduce her with his Charms To an incestuous LoveâHear me Adrasta. Cyr. What does she say! Adra. O Heav'ns! to fetch her Poyson! Cyr. Destraction seize me first! There's not a Fiend so cruel as Cyraxes. Alas, thy Brother bids thee live. Cyth. My Brother ha! Cyr. What did I say? Thy Husband, see. Cyth. My Husband, ha! Tygranes, Murther, Incest! Winds snatch me quickly, Wrap me in Clouds where Storms in Spouts descend, And drop your Burthen in tempestuous Seas, Earth Groans with my incestuous Weight. Tygranes! Oh Tygranes follows meâ Lend me thy Sword that we may part for ever. [Offers to snatch his Sword. Nay, then I all the Elements invoke, Fire, Earth and Water, Daggers, Poyson too, Save me before he comesâbring any Death, To still my Woes and stop my hated Breath. Cyr. Here's no Tygranes, here's no Brother neither Him did I say? Cyraxes is thy Husband. Cyth. Ha! Cyr. I am thy Husband? Cyth. What wast you said! Is't thee or I, or both? say which of us Is madâGrant Heav'n 'tis Cytheria. Cyr. Know'st thou this Ring? Cyth. I know it, if I dare beleive my Senses. More Woes! How cam'st thou by this Ring? Cyr. Thou hast the Counter-part upon thy Finger. Cyth. No matterâsay, how cam'st thou by it? Speak Cyr. I took it from thy Hand. This Morning when I left my Blushing Bride; And gave thee th'other in Exchangeâ Cyth. Ha! hold Cyraxes, stop there for thy Life. The dread of disappointed Hope's far worse Than all the Ills we fear. My Blood grows cold, Convulsions seize my Nerves, My Tongue too falters, and my trembling Joynts Keep Measures with the Beatings of my Heart: Or is all this a Dream? Then do not wake meâ Yet do; for Death is not so terrible as doubt. And was it not Tygranes I did Wed? Speak, that my Woes, or Life may strait have End. Cyr. By all that's binding both in Earth and Heav'n, I was the Man, the Priest did give thee to; The same last Night, that revell'd in thy Arms; The happy Man that rifl'd all thy Charms, And now's no more thy Brother, but thy Husband. Cyth. Hold, stir not yetâ Whither, O whither will my Transports fly! Discharg'd of Fears, my Joys shall hit the Sky. Tho' in Despair, tho' dropping in the Grave Let none against the Gods presume to rave; For Virtue's still the Rule by which they save. Thus, after Shiprack, when the Storm is o'er, The joyful Saylor finds the happy Shore; Just so the Wretch, to Execution lead, When Pardon comes, he starts, as from the Dead, And takes the Grant, and hugs it in his Breast, As I Cyraxes; Love shall speak the rest. Cyr. O Joy! O Love! O Extasie of Bliss! [Flies into his Arms. O killing Pleasures, not to be reveal'd! The Charms of Infants smiling on the Breast, Such Looks that raptur'd Mothers give the Babes Are printed on thy Cheeks, Mildness, and Beauties, With all the Sweets and unexhausted Springs Of virtuous Joys are flowing in this Bosomâ O Cytheria! Cyth. No more the dread of Fate shall check our Wishes, No more the Name of Brother quench our Flames, Now Heav'n has giv'n a Licence to our Joys. O my Cyraxes! See, the King appearsâ We must not yet be seenâLet's haste and find This most unhappy, happy now Tygranes, And to propitious Heav'n joyn with me, And thank the Gods that w'are from Incest free. [Exeunt. Enter Darius, Leamira, Russus Guards and Attendants. Lea. Oh sacred Sir! How fatal was my Birth! But more your favour that first swell'd my Wishes, To leave your Daughter sinking in the Haven, And shiprack'd there of all cou'd make her happy. Can you condemn a Child whom you so lov'd To an unknown, a new Astyages? Whose Virtues, or whose Vices, who can tell, Whether from Heav'n bestow'd, or sent from Hell. Dar. Why Leamira so o'erwhelm'd with Passion! You hear the Revolution of this Day, Our Victory, of Orna's Death, and how The King has own'd an Heir by his first Queen Th'Assyrian PrincessâThis young Prince Without his Guards, t'his conquering Foes is come To offer Peace, and to inrich the Blessing, The Medean Crown for Leamira's Head. Lea. I have no Thoughts, no Veins that run Ambition. Give me your Leave from Greatness to retire, And in some Hermit's peaceful Cell remain, And waste my Life in penitential Tears, Rather than lift me to so loath'd a State. Did I for this poor Cytheria tempt? And force her rashly to Tygranes Bed? And has the curs'd and double-meaning Priest. Or Oracle, or both, created now Another Medean Prince to ruine me! Let me at least give some few Days to Sorrow; For I have vow'd Cleomedon my Love. Dar. Ha! Lea. Be Witness Heaven, I start not at your Frowns, But wish that awful Look may strike me Dead; For Death wou'd re-unite me to my Lord. You will not tell me, Sir, how, where, or when he fell, That I with thinking soon may be distracted. Dar. Ye are a Crew of Courtiers, Sycophants, and Traytors, The flatt'ring, fond Diseases of a Kingdom; How cou'd you else conceal this Frenzy from me! Russ. Most Sacred Sir!â Dar. To Hymen straight conduct the Medean Prince, I'll have the Nuptials solemniz'd this hour. Cleomedon was brave, his Actions noble, 'Bove all Rewards but Leamira's Love. Durst the ambitious Youth look up to Thee! Lea. No, but I look'd first kindly down on him, And rais'd him to the Royal Hopes he fear'd; Thus shou'd the Great look towards such Desert; For what rais'd Greatness first, but humble Merit? But, since he's lost, the World is so to me; My Eyes disdain the Greatness you adore, And will from hence behold Mankind no more. Dar. On your Obedience, Leamira stay: I cou'd begin to Thunder now like Jove; But these fond Tears betray that I'm no God. This Trumpet speaks their coming. Lea. Hide me Palmira, Hide me in thy Bosom. O that I could transform my self to thee As quick as Love can transmigrate the Soul; That thou wer't in my stead, the Medean Queen, And I the happy, innocent Palmira. Enter Cleomedon, Rheusares, and Attendants. Cleo. See at your Feet the Prince of Medea kneels, Cleomedon your General no more, Is now revolted to Darius Foes; Yet I from old Astiages and him, Proclaim, with Persia's King, a lasting Peace. Dar. Rise, Royal Youth! Ye God's, what wonder's this! And what new Miracles d'you bring? Cleo. O tell me first, why does that beauteous Princess Turn from my sight the Blessings of her Eyes, My Love's ador'd and Valour's richest Prize? Lea. What welcom Sound is that? what charming Voice So like Cleomedon's? 'Tis he! 'tis he! Aid me, ye Powers, and all you Friends to Love! Tell me, where am I? Breath I? Do I live? O let me dwell in the transporting Vision, And never wake me from this Extasie. Cleo. Behold the Man, devinest Princess! Who ne'er till now had Courage to approach you, Who Bankrupt was to ev'ry thing but Love, Brings now a Crown and Kingdoms to enrich it. Dispell, bright Goddess of the Day these Clouds; All killing Doubts, and anxious Thoughts remove; Wake to Cleomedon, and wake to Love, Wake to Astiages, his Passion crown; For both are Leamira's, both are one. Lea. Heav'ns, is it possible! Can this be He! It is, it isâThou coud'st not but be Royal. Tell me, bright Powers! Who shall your Praises sing? How just you are to Truth, how kind to Love! Dar. Rack me no more with DoubtsâSpeak some of you, And tell us this miraculous Event. Rheu. Royal Cyraxes; best of Prince's, hear, Learn from Rheusares loyal Breast alone, This most convincing, most amazing Truth: Dar. I cannot, but beleive thee, good old Man! For only Truth resides in thee. Rheu. The Prince whom you behold, Cleomedon, Is young Astiages, Son of the old, And the Assyrian Princess, his first Queen, Whom Orna did attempt to kill by Poyson! At length, assisted by the faithful Russus, I sent him, then a Child, to Assyria's Court, And plain enough demonstrance made to Orna, Who so desir'd it, that his Death was certain: His Sister Cytheria too, I ventur'd To breed as mine, and call Cyraxes Brother. Lea. What suddain Blast is this to all my Hopes! O cruel Death to all my springing Joys! I see no promis'd Bliss can come sincere, No perfect Good to Mortals, no blest Day, Without a Night, no Happiness without Allay. Speak, tell me quick; is Cytheria then Sister to you, and to Tygranes? Rheu. She is. Be patient, we shall all unfold. Lea. I'll ne'er be patientâhear me first I beg you; There more depends on that than Fate can alter. Rheu. When I beheld th'unhappy Medean King Brought to this low Estate, my injur'd Heart, Tho' steel'd with Wrongs, relented into Pity, And cou'd no longer hold such Comfort from him, Nor see the Son make War against the Father, But Russus sent, to make the glad discov'ry. The rest, let Russus tell. Cleo. Let Russus hold, And only me excuse an erring Father, Who, freed from Orna's most bewitching Charms, With welcom Joy receiv'd our clear Credentials, And near, in his Pavilion, now expects The Persian King to hear the Proofs confirm'd, And seal what Articles Darius please. What I've to ask, is of deviner Moment, More than your Kingdoms, or the World can give, Ev'n this inestimable Brightness. Dar. Too great your Merit, and too just your Claim, To be deny'dâBut wherefore weeps our Daughter? Lea. O Misery on Misery! Cleomedon! Oh Royal Sir! All is undone again. Poor Cytheria's lost, for ever lost, Your Daughter wretched, and Tygranes ruin'd! Think of a Sin too horrrid to be nam'd, And call it Incest, that, which starts the Gods, Of that they both are guilty; By me betray'd, and both condemn'd by me. Poor Cytheria's marryed to her Brother. Thinking that way to shun the Prince of Media; I, with these Tears, forc'd the unwilling Maid, To give her wretched Hand to poor Tygranes. Cleo. O dire Misfortune! Lea. Tear me from thy Bosom. Send me to Desarts to instruct the Tygers, And herd with Beasts as cruel as my self. Rheu. None shall have Cause to grieve this happy Day. All now is well. Inform'd of the Design Our Medean Princess had to Wed Tygranes, Too well I know the fatal Consequence, And working on their Plot, by Darkness favour'd, With easie Change I sent my Son Cyraxes, Who marry'd Cytherea undiscover'd, Secur'd Tygranes by a quick Surprize, And all things to Success by Heav'n was turn'd To this concluding HappinessâBut see The strangely happy-fated Pair approach. Enter Cyraxes and Cytheria. Lea. O ye kind Gods! O Cytheria! Hold me to thy Breast, Shield me, thy Friend, just trembling with my Fears, Scarce wak'd from Terrors far more Dark than Death. Canst thou forgive me? Cyth. Not to forgive the Fountain of my Joys! What, and have thee, and my Cyraxes in my Arms! How fathomless to mortal reach is Providence! This is the Brother we so vainly shunn'd, That Heav'n ordain'd to make us both so happy. Cyr. Thus, while I hold her, thus within my Arms, I'm happier than the Monarch of the Skies; Thus, like the Thunderer, in my Joys I move, And loose the Brother in the Consort Jove. Dar. O Sons! So will I call you now for ever. Be happy both in Love and WarâO Daughter! Receive and bless the Man the Gods have giv'n you. Enter Tygranes. But see, Tygranes comesâWelcom, brave Prince! You've heard of all the Wonders of this Day, And your propitious, most miraculous Fate. Tygr. I have. Cleo., Cyth. Our dearest Brother! Tygr. Blast me, ye Powers, or I adore the Name. Curst be Tygranes when his Love forsakes you, Astiages is now most priz'd by me, And Laura is as dear as Cytherea. O Sister! Brother' Witness all the Joy Of this most happy ChangeâNo wanton Fires Possest this Breast, but lambent all and chaste, By Heav'ns sole Dictates and the force of Blood. 'Tis happier now to die, from Incest freed, Than live with Medea's Crown upon my Head. Cleo. Come to my Heart, possess me All, and share The Crown that thou alone deserv'st to wear. Cyth. For Cytherea's Sake whom you so lov'd, Be reconcil'd to Happiness and me. Tygr. No, Cytherea, no, illustrious Brother! Soon as our Kings in Bonds of Peace are joyn'd, And Hymen's joyful shining Tapors lighted, The Blaze shall guide me to some lone Retreat, My House, my Family, and little State, Not basely mean, nor yet profusely great; Where, near the Ocean, I the Wrecks may see, And yet my self from Storms and Tempests free; No higher aim to be, than, of the Spring, And my Arcadian Youth the Garland King; Take a long Leave to Beauty and Renown, Nor dread to loose, nor hope to gain a Crown: Ambition is a Slave, and Fortune fears The Honest Man, and virtuous rule the Stars. Dar. Mount then Astiages the Persian Throne, My Head's too feeble for the ponderous weight, Persia and Medea shall your Nod obey, Let me sit quiet and direct your Sway. Cleo. Crowning my Joys with this Illustrious Maid, Above your Empire, Sir, your Soldier's paid. Cyr. We all to soon on Happiness depend, But Goodness must decree it in the End. Thus the Kind Powers both Love and Peace restore, And scarcely leave us time to wish for more; The Good have Heav'n their sure and certain Guard, And Virtue always meets a just Reward. [Exeunt.
