      <field name="fulltext">Scene Jerusalem.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue to the Arab. Mr Henderson Prologues were first devis'd to introduce The Scene's ensuing fable, but abuse Hath marr'd a good old custom, and they shew Everything nowâbut what you wish to know. Our Author, ever studious to obey And follow where your wishes point the way, Bids me premise, that in these Scenes you'll find The coarse rude sketch of an untutor'd Mind, Heaven's work unfinish'd, a deserted Child Of Nature, dropt in an Arabian wild: Snatcht to a throne, before his wondering Eyes He sees a new-discover'd world arise; Revenge, Ambition sturggle for controul, Love tempts, and Jealousy torments his Soul: Whilst furious passions urge his wavering Youth, And his Soul vibrates betwixt guilt and truth, The Bard steps inâwith Virtue's conquring Wreath; And crowns him sinking in the arms of death. There is, who acts Revenge's direst part, And braves the' unwelcome province of her art, Staunch to ye drama's duty, at the word Forbears to please and strives to be abhorr'd; Like the CumÃ¦an Sibyll bound to go Her bard's Companion to the shades below; On her dark visit fearless she descends, To snatch her Lawrels from the vanquisht Fiend. In times long past the English Muse was known To stock new Worlds with Beings of her own: Bright Inspiration burst from Shakspear's Mind Wild as the torrent, lawless as the wind; Exhausted Nature at her partial breast To feed one giant Son starv'd all the rest; Fainting she sate by Avon's flowery Side, Then sunkâexulting with a Mother's pride. Weak Pity saw the Mighty Master rise And trembling turn'd aside with Streaming Eyes; Love, Love himself at last compell'd to yeild, Ling'ring retir'dâand Terror seiz'd the field: Then, then the Poet, rising in his art, No longer courted, but compell'd the heart; Then Swift as thought his magic-moving Scene Tho' Mountains rose and Oceans roll'd between, Vaulted from realm to realmâThe World's wide Sphere Was Space too narrow for his vast Career. Oh! that these glorious triumphs of the Stage Had been reserv'd for this Enlighten'd Age!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 1. Scene Jerusalem. Night: The Entrance of a prison. Augusta enters attended by a Guard and Mutesâbearing torches. Augusta Advance your torches to the dungeon's mouth! Shew the dark Cell that wretched thing inhabits, That owns the name of Mariamne.âStand. I'll not descend the gulph: It yawns so wide, So frightfully with these it's iron teeth; And breathes a vapour from its cavern'd lungs So pestilential, I'll advance no nearer. Summon the Keeper: Call forth Sameas.âHark! (Sameas enters.) Sams- Hail, royal Mistress! great Augusta, hail! (Kneels) Auga- Stand up and answer. Sams- What woud Judah's Queen? Auga- I woud behold thy prisoner: I woud see How gracefully this Heroine wears her Chains, The World's late wonder, Herod's matchless Queen. Set her before me; Let me see if still Those conquering eyes, whose fires extinguish'd mine, Maintain their lustre. Twice ten tedious years She triumph'd on my throne: if there be comfort, If recreation to a wasted Spirit In a proud rivall's fall, give my revenge What name thou wilt; it must be nature still. Sams- True, nature warrants and thy wrongs demand Revenge: Tis fitting, and behold! tis full. Auga- How else shoud perishable nature stand A seige of woes so numberless, if dreams Of dear Revenge, and one one saving spark Of hope, still glimmering thro' the dismal void, Those chearing Visitors had not upheld me? Now if thou art with me, Sameas, if strong cause And fair occasion urge to Execution, Why is the deed delay'd? Lo! here are Mutesâ The moment's our's: Need I explain the rest? Sams- No, for the deed is done. Auga- Say'st thou tis done? Is Mariamne dead? make my faith sure! Confirm it with an Oath. Sams- Then hear me, Heaven!â But where's the need?âHere, in this spot she fell. On this hard stone she knelt and pray'd for pity; But pray'd in vain; My unrelenting dagger Silenc'd her suit, and er'e this Morning's Sun Rose on the world your Rival was no more. Auga- May I beleive thee? Thou art young in Office, Nor hast that practis'd firmness, which can stand The Shock of pity and the mute perswasion Of a fair Woman's tears. Where is the Body? Sams- Within these prison-walls there is a pit Dark and of depth unfathom'd, there it lies, The trunk, on which of late such beauty grew. There in the mass of common wretchedness Ambition moulders, and with vulgar dress Joins its imperial one. Dismiss your Mutes. Auga- Strike out your torches, Fellows, and depart. (exeunt) Since thou hast stept thus far in blood, proceed: Wade thro' the crimson tide and snatch at Fortune, That beckons to thee from across the Surge. Sams- What more is to be done? Auga- Herodian lives: The Heir of Empire, Mariamne's Son. Oh, thou art short, too short in this great matter, Whilst he survives.âNow, what provokes this haste? (A Messenger enters) Messr- The King upon the sudden is assailed with raging Agonies. Auga- Tis frequent with him. Some flaw or gust of Choler. Messr- Many such At times your Slave hath noted, never one So terrible as this. Auga- This comes too soon; Our state of preparation it outruns: These Sallies of a mind so prone to passion May shift to dangerous points. Back to your Charge. We shall attend the King. Sameas, farewell! (exit) Sameas Guards to your posts! double the Centinels Upon their watch this Night, and suit your Vigilance To the Time's just Occasionâ (exeunt Guards) (Halak enters) Oh! tis vain Day after day to press your suit upon me; This wearisome and vain. Halak- Therefore to mercy, Which you have not, I make no more appeal: Now hear a different pleaâWhere is your prudence; Your wise precaution for a change of times? I come this instant from the dying King: No human frame can long abide the shock Of such fierce Agonies: Have you reflected What jeopardy you stand in, and where next JudÃ¦a Crown may pass? Sameas- I have reflected, And in such ready preparation stand, As the Time's danger claims. Halak- Your Royal Prisoner The Queen, whom here in rigid hold you keep, Hath a brave Son; A youth of princely hopes, Nurtur'd at Rome. Who bars his right of Empire? Doth Rome? vain question! Doth the tribe of Judah Exclude the Seed of David? vainer still. The Covenant of Heaven is with his House For endless generations. Hah! that strikes: I see your reason pauses to reflect What fate may wait thee, when Herodian reigns. Sams- I act not here, as by my own discretion: But when the Royal Mandate calls for blood, Repugnant pity dares not interpose, And blood must answer it. Halak- Accursed Office! Direful Commission! Do not talk of pity, Let reason hold the Scale. I have liv'd long In Courts, and by Experience know the Maze Of Politics how intricate it is, Augusta hath been with you; At the portal I crosst upon your Queen. Need I be told Her murderous Errand? No: right well she sees Her power now wavering on the moments point And whilst she can she strikes: So do not thou: If not in mercy, yet in prudence pause, And wait the Time's Event. Sameas- Halak, your Zeal For Mariamne dictates this advice: And, tho' your age in any other cause With wisdom's voice might tutor, yet in this Tis fit I hear you with reserve and caution. [Can I revive the Dead?] [Halak- Hah! is she dead.] [Oh horrible! have you destroy'd her?] [Sameas- Calm your transport.] [I act by warrant of authority;] [So do not you who question meâAnd yet] sure I might confide in thee; Yet were I If you will bury in your breast my Secret [Safe from the babbling Winds, the Eyes and Ears] [Of this Jerusalem in which we live;] If you will swear to meâ Halak- You know me well; You know long proof has Sanctified my Honour; My Faith is not in training, nor can oaths Add confirmation to my promis'd Truth. Sameas- Then know this also, Mariamne lives. Yes, and shall live spite of a thousand mandates, Till Herod dies and fate decides the Crown. But if Augusta's long expected Son, If Prince Abidah, who, as fame reports, Is journeying from Arabia, shall appear And mount JudÃ¦a's throne, she dies: no more. Halak- Yet hear me, Sameas; er'e my Queen shall die Here in these iron Caves, fell Murder's den, Grant I implore one parting interview To an old faithful Servant, one sad look; T'will be but short, for on my Soul I think The very sight will kill me. Sameas- Thro' these doors, Save those who here are inmates, none can pass: But here amongst so many witnesses To hold the Queen, no longer woud be safe After decree of death: Come then tomorrow To Ahab's tower, in the old palace Square, By dawn of day; there every eye is mine: There you shall see your Queen. Halak- I'll meet thee there E're morning dawn. Sameas- Till then farewell. Halak- Remember! (Exit Sameas. Tomorrow! Hope yet lives: Before tomorrow Some hours have still to roll; and if kind Heaven, That still delights to frustrate Evil plots, Prosper the interim, my Prince perhaps, Herodian may arrive. and Herod's heart, E're yet it cease to beat, may turn to mercy: Then shall Augusta and her Arab Son With this her Idumean Crew be driven Back to their native wretchedness, amidst Samarian Deserts, whilst the Race of David, Heaven's own Elect, shall fill JudÃ¦a's throne. (Herodian with Attendants.) Herodn- Leave me; depart!âThey tell me thou art Halak; And in thy features, spite of all the change, That time has wrought, my memory still can trace An antient valued friend. Halak- Uphold me, Heaven! Am I so blest? Do I behold Herodian? Herodn- All that is left of him: Your Courier met me, As I was journeying thro' the marshy Vale Of watery Mamaleck. Halak- Supreme of Powers! Accept thy Creature's praises. O my Prince, Let me embrace thy knees. (Kneels) Herodn- Rise, rise! my heart Is throbbing with anxiety and terror. Lives our dear Mother yet? Halak- Thy Mother lives. Herodn- And this her Habitationâ Halak- Here she dwells. Herodn- Accursed Mansion! do not quite forsake My heart, O Nature; give not wholly up A Son to impious parricidal rage, Angels of Mercy! Yet I'll call him Tyrant, Not father, but unfeeling barbarous Tyrant, Monster renounc'd of Heav'n. Halak- Turn from the Scene: Dear Royal Youth and arm thyself with patience. Herodn- No, let me enter; let my Eyes behold These murder-stained Vaults and the sad Souls, Their miserable tenants; let me hear The clank of fetters and the piercing yell Of Wretches writhing on the rack, whose lips, Quivering with mortal agonies, confess All that extorting Cruelty prescribes, To purchase intermission from their pangs. Halak- Alas, if you woud ask admittance here, The walls shall answer to your Suit as soon As those who guard them; better t'were the Grave Swallow'd affection and all tender ties Of love and kindred than those flinty Vaults. Herodn- If I cannot redeem my Mother hence, I will divorce myself from Heavn's fair face, From light and love and my ador'd Glaphyra, Here to abide with darkness and despair, With sighs and groans, that load the wings of Time, Till he scarce creeps to his slow period Death. Halak- Talk not of death, but hasten to your father, Before he drops into the grave, that yawns To swallow him and all your hopes of Empire. Herodn- Yes I will hasten to him and demand My portion and inheritance of ruin: Stranger altho' I be; it hath been told me How many Seers and holy men inspir'd Here have consum'd their lamentable lives For Ages past: Here late the Hermit-Saint, Who thro' the Wilderness with warning voice Call'd to repentance, fell beneath the Axe, That his dissever'd head might grace the revells Of a lewd capering MinstrelâLet me enter: For Persecution now is Virtue's test, And it is infamy to be at large. Halak- The moments, Prince, are precious, which we waste In profitless Complaint. The King yet lives; I feel the danger of your Interveiw, Yet as your sudden presence at this Crisis May waken Conscience, that has slept within him; I counsel you to seize the instant Now Before your brother, slave-born, base Abidah, From his Arabian desarts shall arrive, As shagged Esau from his chace of old, And claim an elder birthright. Herodn- Hah! shall He, That vagrant Ishmalite aspire to reign, No, Mine's a Cause that justifies Ambition, Nay, ev'n Revenge itself. Here in these Cells A Mother pines imprison'd; there awaits me A Royal Maid bethroth'd, Glaphyra, rich In every grace that can adorn a throneâ Halak- What do I hear? who is this Royal Maid, And where does she await you? Herodn- I have told thee Her name Glaphyra; Syria's exil'd Monarch, Seleucus, was her father; Sea and Land From Rome's far-distant City we have travers'd With destin'd purpose in my father's Court To solemnize our Nuptials; On my way Some two days Journey from Jerusalem Your fatal tidings met me; for myself I kept my Course undaunted, nay Revenge Spurr'd me to double speed; not so Glaphyra: Her I have left to the experienc'd care Of old Philotas; underneath whose roof I harbour'd in the Vale of Mameleck. Now to the Palace; at our better leisure You shall hear more. Halak- Lead on. I follow thee. End of the 1s t. Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 2 The Palace. Augusta and Sameas. Sameas No fierce DÃ¦moniac ever rag'd so madlyâ Jerusalem shall see her King no more. Auga- Nor is it to be wish'd. Sams- Not to be wish'd? Auga- Have you forgot that Mariamne liv'd Till you destroy'd her? Come no more of this. Tis mere hypocrisy: I know your prayers Are for his death. Sams- Can Sameas wish him dead, In whom Augusta lives? Auga- Oh dull of heart! Did you not hear him rave on Mariamne, Whilst the Fit shook him? Me he spurn'd aside, And shuddering wrapt his Mantle o're his face. Too well I know the perilous prerogative Of her that shares the diadem of Herod. This in your EarâNor I, nor you can know A peaceful dream, till Herod sleeps for ever! Sams- And yet but now you deem'd his death too sudden Auga- True, but my prospect then was dark and cloudy; Now the sun smiles; the land in view looks joyful, And happily we ride before the gale Or'e swelling seas with full and favouring tide Into the haven of prosperity. Rome's Legate is my own, his venal voice Speaks in my Coffers, and in CÃ¦sar's name Decrees JudÃ¦a's throne to my Abidah: Nay to crown all the Princely Youth's arriv'd! Sams- This, this is fortune's Crisis; Such a meeting Must be a feast of rapture to your Soul. Suffer your Servant to enquire if Nature Hath done her part with kindness; Is he comely, Gallant and graceful? doth he wear a look High and beseeming of his royal Birth; Or hath Bethanor's rustic training marr'd The vigour and ambition he is heir to? Auga- As yet I have not seen him: This I learn Of his Conductors by the way, his Air Is bold and dauntless, and his manners wild As the Arabian Hordes, with whom he liv'dâ But see! the faithful good old Man approaches. (Bethanor enters) Welcome, Bethanor! Hold: No Knee to me. Give me your HandâAh! my good friend, is't so? Twenty long years, gone round since last we parted, Have left methinks some tracks of Winter here. Sameas, withdraw! (exit Sameas) And am I yet to tell you What place you keep in this recording Heart? How inmost you are here? No, my good friend, The trust, that in your bosom I have lodg'd, The dearest Secret of my Life to you Alone confided, witness my regard. Bethr- And I have kept your trust religiously. Auga- I will not doubt it. Bethr- I have hope you do not. Auga- No, on my Life! I know you to be faithful: Let that suffice. Is the Young man here with you? Bethr- He waits your pleasure. Auga- That is well. The Prince We now must call him, and my SonâDost pause? Bethr- No; be it so, if such thy pleasure, yetâ Auga- What yet? I'll be obey'd: Let no suspicion Shake your full confidence of that. Again?â What means that movement? Speak! reveal thy thoughts, Art not content? If my preventive Bounty Hath left thee nothing for thyself to wish, Adopt another's wants, invent desires; Be satisfaction henceforth turn'd to Surfeit; And let imagination weary out Thy tongue with asking e're my hand with giving. Bethr- Below ambition, yet above caprice Thy Servant seeks not to obtrude a wish. Auga- Why then thou art content: But art thou also Mindful of former days and that sad state Of mournfull want, in which my bounty found thee? Is it still present to thy mind how low Misfortunes leaden hand had prest thee down In life's profound decline? Twas then thou took'st The newborn infant from his Mothers breast, And in the secret and still hour of night, Unseen of all, thy healthy rustic chang'd For my lost hope, Expiring at my side: Since then thy Son, this Youth, who now attends, Is my Abidah; mineâand shall inherit The Crown, now dropping from the brow of Herod. Bethr- Now, gracious Mistress, hear your Servant speak. Unfit for Empire is my humble boy. I do beseech your greatness to consider How raw, untutor'd in the race of Glory His youthful hours, till now some two moons past, Have calmly crept in solitary haunts By Amram's lazy stream,âwhat shoud he know Of this great world more than a Shepherd's boy? And how shoud I a poor unletter'd Rustic, Train up a Son for Empire and Augusta? Auga- No more of this. Altho' your Son, Bethanor, Without one kingly atom were compounded, Yet shoud he mount the throne. What, have I toil'd, Glutted the avarice of Rome with gold, And dy'd my Conscience red with human blood, To make the race of Mariamne Kings? Set him before me. Bethr- I obey: But look To see the meerest Child of Nature, one As void of courtly manners, as of craft For never yet in Cities hath he dwelt, But with the wand'ring Ishmaelite in Camps. Out of the track and danger of pursuit. Auga- I like his training wellâAnd see! he comes. (Abidan with Arab Attendants) Welcome, my Son! thrice welcome to my Sight! Ten thousand benedictions on the moment, That gives thee to my wish!âStand off a while, And let me veiw theeâOh! tis well, tis well. Nature has built a goodly pallace here, And a brave Spirit tenants itâMy Son, Come to my Arms! At length thou hast a Mother. And, tho' hard fate forbade that I shoud pay thee The Service of a Mother, I have hope That thou can'st love me. Abidah- Yes, I love most things, That suffer pain or misery. Did not Herod Shut thee in prison from my birth till now? And does the Tyrant live? Auga- He lives, Abidah. Abidh- Now by the Soul of Honour, which is in me, Were I Augusta, I'd not suffer it. Bethr- Silence, rash Youth; you speak you know not what. Abidh- I speak by Nature's teaching, and you've told me Such are not apt to err: Your modes I know not; But we, the world's free denizans, who range With flocks and herds in common, where fresh pasture And welcome springs invite, must keep men honest By rendr'ing wrong for wrong, and death for death: Our Law and our Religion is Revenge. Auga- His Arab principles delight me well. And now prepare to know thyself, Abidah, For what thou art, and not what thou hast been. No longer now beside the reedy bank Of Amram's stream thou tend'st Bethanor's flock; It is not now the Wolf or flying Deer, But bright Ambition which thou hold'st in chace. Put Life into thy looks and meet the time With bridal Smiles, that weds thee to a throne. Abidh- What throne? O Shame! a tributary throne. Abject Ambition! Nobler lot with these (pointing to his Arabs) To Sweep the desart with unshackled feet Than here to Sit in delegated Purple, And meanly catch a faint reflected lustre From CÃ¦sar's glittering Orb. Bethr- Restrain thyself: Know'st thou to whom thou speakest? Abidh- Tell the Queen How I chastis'd the Wretch, that woud have forc'd The Syrian damsel. Auga- What dost thou allude to? Tell it thyself. Abidh- I'm ill at such relations. Auga- I'll hear it from none other. Abidh- So it chanc'd Myself and old Bethanor hous'd last night With a grave Elder of the tribe of Levi. Our Guard encampt without. At dead of night When all but villainy was laid to rest, A female scream from an adjoining Chamber Rous'd me from sleep; sudden as thought I leapt From my rude lair, and, snatching up my Sword, Ran where the sound directed; There I found A Damsel struggling in the lustful Arms Of this old Caitiff: quick I sprung upon him, And drove my rapier to his panting heart. But lest the maid, whose beauty had provok'd This heat in frozen age, might haply touch My youthful veins with the like guilty flame, I pray thee to receive her to thy care, And send her hence in Safety from my Sight. Auga- Where is the Damsel? Abidh- She attends your pleasure. Auga- Bethanor, bring her to me. (exit Bethanor T'was well done To rescue innocence; but still beware Of Love, my Son: Tis not a Hero's passion. Abidh- I know not what Love is: I never felt it. But this I know, no woman half so lovely, E're met my eyes beforeâLook where she comes! (Bethanor enters with Glaphyra) Auga- Why tis a form compounded of all beauty, Simplicity with Elegance combin'd And Virgin dignity; Come hither Syrian; What is thy name, condition and degree? Glapa- Of no ignoble house; my name Glaphyra, An Orphan Maid. Auga- What brings thee to JudÃ¦a? Glapa- My Brother in the Syrian Legion serves Against the plundering Arabs that infest JudÃ¦a's fertile bordersâfor the rest Spare me the dreadful tale; let it suffice To Providence and This, it's guardian instrument, My brave deliverer, words cannot serve To speak my gratitude, nor life to pay it. Auga- What more have you to ask? consult your wishes. Glapa- Immediate and safe conduct from Jerusalem. Auga- Whither? Glapa- To Smyrna. Auga- Wherefore; on what call; And why with haste so pressing? Abidh- Urge her not; I share with her the pain your questions give: Let her depart; her Honour asks it of you, And my repose demands it. Auga- It is granted. You of my Train meanwhile attend the Damsel Some needful rest her wearied frame requires, Whilst we direct the means of her departure. (Sameas enters) Now, Sameas, what's thy news? How fares the King? Sams- Wild as the raging seas: his visage chang'd To death-like symptoms. He commands thy presence. Auga- I shall obey: proceed. My Son; farewell! I leave thee with regretâBernice, Rhoda, Look to your charge. Guards, you behold your Prince. (Exit with Sameas) Bethr- Come, noble Youth, let us retire a while. Abidh- Why does she stay? perverse, to rack my Spirit And tempt it past its bearing. Bethr- Be a Man! Break off, nor let this weakness steal upon you. Abidh- Did I not well? Bethr- Thou didst; and therefore faint not In thy well-doing. Abidh- Whilst she stays, I'm rooted She anchors in my heart. Send her away. Glapa- A word and then farewellâMay Heav'n preserve thee, As thou hast me, brave Youth, from Nightly treason, Or Violence, that dares the face of day! I see that in thy Solitary haunts Thou hast convers'd with Virtue; Oh, persist! Keep her forever near; loose not her hand; Lead her to Courts, to Councils, on the throne Make her thy Consort, and, when Night comes on, Place that one faithful centinel beside thee, And thou shalt sleep secure. Abidh- Stay, lovely Monitor! Talk on till yonder gawdy Sun goes down, Then cease not, but, when all is husht to silence But the Soft music of thy voice, proceed And charm the listening Stars. Bethr- Undone and lost! Now who shall stem the torrent of his Passion? Abidh- Now thou art silent; now thy looks are fearful, And I offend. Oh, teach me how to please thee! I know my form is like my manners wild, Rude and unpleasing; but so thou wilt teach me, Thy rustic pupil shall not prove unapt. What have I seen amongst thy sex, but thee? External shapes of things, that walk and move With nature's due proportions, but unpolisht And barbarous as myself. They catch the Eye, Thou Ear, Eye, Heart. They are but earthy beings, Thou art all soul, a purifying Spirit, And mak'st me a new Creature. Glapha- Pray no more: Here we must part. Abidh- Yet er'e we part, declare Is there another purer Name than Love, That, when I put up prayers for thee in absence, I may adopt it. Glapha- Friendship. Abidh- Ah! what's friendship? To my own sex tis proper and apportion'd; I've pledg'd it to Bethanor; the wild tribes, Hundreds of wand'ring Arabs have my friendship; The very brutes in some degree possess it. But thou, fair Maid, for whom my Heart conceives A new sensation, thou shoud'st so describe it, That other Object may not claim or share it. Glapha- Banish these fruitless fancies from thy mind, They will corrode its peace: hopeless affection, What is it but the Canker of the Heart? Leave me to my obscurityâFarewell! Abidh- Stay! must I lose thee! tis not to be suffer'd. Bethr- Not to be suffer'd! what do you intend? Recall the base Expression! Abidh- Base do you call it? The base Expression! Bethr.- I avow the term: Commit what crime you dare; I'm not afraid To give it it's true name: When you detain This Maid against her will, I call your Act Selfish, unmanly, base. Was you so treated? Did er'e Abidah feel restraint? The winds Rang'd not more freely; t'was your Nature's right, And you enjoy'd it: The same right was her's; Till your Command revokes it. O bright omen Of an auspicious reign! Damsel, withdraw! I woud fain see who stays youâSo! tis past. (Exit Glaphyra. Abidh- Draw forth thy Sword and strike it to my Heart! Bethr.- No, to my own. Death cannot be so dreadful As thy decline from Virtue. Abidh- Nay, but strike! For if I'm that base thing Bethanor thinks me, Why doth Abidah live? Bethr- I've been too warm; And baseness; which thy noble Heart abhors, Was a rash wordâBut yet beware, my prince, Some Vices in their infancy usurp A Virtuous semblance; hell-born Lust awhile It's goatish ugliness can varnish or'e With cherub smiles of Love; by soft approach And playful dalliance spreads it's lurking fires, Then, like the furious Levite whom you slew, Bursts into flame and deals destruction round. Abidh- No, if her form, tho fair, coud so defile The Sanctuary of my Honour, by my Soul! This daggar which I wear shoud rip it out; Tho' it entwin'd my heart. Bethr- Child of my Soul! I know thou woudstâAnd yet when I behold The crimson tumult rushing to thy cheeks, When thy fond Eyes drank streams of fond desire From the fair Syrian, will Abidah blame me, That I cried out, beware? will he not pardon A zeal too forward, a fond father's zeal For a beloved Son? indulge my weakness, I cannot easily forego the name. Abidh- Nor shalt thouâThus with my embrace I seal it. Now as I feel the pressure of thine Arms On my encircled neck, each filial nerve With Sympathetic tremor strikes my Heart, And tells me tis a father I enfold. Bethr- Oh! truly spoke. O Nature, what thou art! (aside) Abidh- Dearest and best of friends, I look about This new found World with horror: Beauty here With tempting Smiles allures me to dishonour; There gaunt Ambition's Spectre haunts my Sight, Rapine and Lust and Murder howl around me, Those fiends that lurk beneath a throne. Farewell To those calm-hours, when each returning day On Amram's banks we call'd the golden Sun Up to the East, and met the dewy breath Of Morning issuing from the flowery Vale: These are for ever gone. Bethr- And what can Empire Give in Exchange for these so peaceful scenes? Abidh- Power, that dispenses blessings to Mankind, And Empire founded in my People's Hearts. Bethr- Then hear me, Heaven! and if my breath hath fann'd The native spark of this etherial fire, That burns within him, grant my parting prayer! Nourish the sacred flame, and as thy hand Hath rais'd it high, Oh, keep it ever Bright! That, like a beacon on the Mountain's top, His high-enthroned Virtue may be seen Clear and unsullied by a guilty World. Abidh- Oh! still be near me; still direct my Course, And, what you've rais'd, support! Bethr- I'll not forsake thee; And shoud the false lights of this treacherous world Divert (which Heav'n forbid!) thy youthful course From the warm chase of glory, in that moment I will come forth, recall thy devious Steps Back to the saving point, from which they stray'd, And put thee in the glorious track again.

      <field name="fulltext">Act 3. (Herodian meets Halak, as he comes out from the King's ChamberâGuards mounted at the door.) Herodian Now Halak, doth the King our father live?â No, He is deadâThat look too plainly speaks His death and my despair! Halak- Dead is thy father, And dead thy hope: I cannot mask the truth. Herodn- Nor need you, Why was not I call'd in time? So had I rous'd him to a deed of mercy, And sent him lighter in default to Heaven. Halak- It coud not be: Death gave no warning here, But sprung at once with fury on his Victim As t'were his purpose to preclude repentance. Herodn- Horrible consummation! Was you present? If so, relate the manner. Halk- Words woud fail me; The nature of a Son coud not support it. Convuls'd with dreadful agonies he died, His corpse affrights beholders. Herodn- What hath follow'd? Halk- Rome's mercenary Legate hath proclaim'd Your Arab rival King. Herodn- Abidah King? An Ãthiop, line his sooty palm with gold, Shall purchase Judah's diadem. Halk- Break off! See where he comes! there is no safety here, Augusta tooâ Herodn- I'll meet them, tho' t'were death. Halk- Tis madness, ruinâ Herodn.- Off! I am resolv'd. Abidah with his Arab guards, habited as King, Augusta, Bethanor and Jewish Guards &amp;c &amp;c. Abidah Are all these Ceremonies in your Law? Auga- All indispensible; our Jewish Rabbi Devoted to their forms, account them sacred. Abidh.- They weary me; but tho' no time methinks Nor antient use can dignify such trifles, Yet let them take their course: What next ensues? Auga- Nothing but to consign to holy Earth Your father's cold remains. Abidh.- Stand! who are these? Auga.- One I can answer for, my antient Enemy The traitor HalakâGuards, arrest him! Abidh.- Hold! Short Councils like me well, and yet, good Mother, A man's life may be worth a moment's pause. The Traitor! why? Is Treason in his face? I see none there: Many an honest man Might barter looks with him, and be no loser By the Exchange. And what is He, that turns Disdainful from our presence? Speak; who art thou? Herodn- Say'st thou who am I? woud'st thou humble me To what I hold the lowest of my titles, Call me thy Brother. Augusa.- Heav'n and Earth! Herodian Herodn- Tygress of IdumÃ¦a, I am he, The Son of Mariamne. Abidh- Were you Son Of CÃ¦sar, you shoud hold an humbler language: The rights of hospitality protect you, Whilst you are here in peace: But if you come With bold defiance to affront our presence, Charge, but with manly weapons, not with words, Nor make a Woman's war. Herodn- When I stand here With only truth and justice on my Side, Both naked, both disarm'd, can you demand If tis my purpose to affront your power Or brave your person? I have here in pledge A father dead and an imprison'd Motherâ Abidh.- Set her at large! Auga- It must not be. Abidh- Why not? Is there a thing we fear? Augusa- Six Years I reign'd In Herod's heart, his Consort and a Queen; When Mariamne's Arts seduc'd him from me. Me he repudiates and espouses her. Nor is this all; She rises in revenge, And unrelenting barrs me in a prison For twice ten years; my Infant Son meanwhile Driv'n to Arabia's desartsâbut that Son Is now before me. Shall I plead to him? Arm'd with the Sword of empire, which I gave him, Vengeance in him is duty, filial duty; And by a Mother's title I demand it! Abidh- Fetters and prisons are a Coward's Weapons, A Tyrant's mean resource; let the Laws shackle Robbers and theives, but my Ambition's Rival Let him be free as air, range o're the world; And if, like me, he loves a brave revenge, No fear but we shall meet.âTill then farewell! Herodn- In Courts like this, floated with human blood, And peopled with Assassins, where you keep Records of Heav'n and Ordinances fram'd By God himself only to be the sport Of shameless hypocrites, it moves my wonder To find one advocate for mercy, one So singular of Soul, so strange of manners, And in a Mother's precepts so unschool'd. Abidh- I cannot talk, my only Argument Is Nature, and in her unletter'd Volumn Dwells all the little Science I can boast. Exil'd and wand'ring o're Arabia's Wilds, Whither your persecuting Mother drove me From infancy till now, your Laws and Records Are undivulg'd to me; I neither question, Nor can acknowledge what I never Saw. Herodn- Yet by those sacred laws my right to reign, As heir of David's lineage, stands enroll'd With dire denunciation of God's wrath On all opposers. Abidh- To the Sanhedrim With all such titles! to the Scribes and Elders With rules and records, legendary tales And Chronicles long past: they fetter Kings, And manacle the Sinews of ambition. If thou woud'st meet me hand to hand in arms, Go forth! convoke thy friends, erect thy standard And strike for Empire! Arm'd with Right divine, Take all the heroes of thy race in aid, Nay, conjure up the Dead: Take Mariamne, Thy Mother, take her hence: I'll not detain, Living or dead, one atom of thy Blood. Herodn- I hold thee to thy word; produce my Mother, Release thy prisoner and I'll own thee noble! Abidh- Not to extort applause from thee, proud man, (The vanity of mercy I contemn) But to demonstrate to thee how I scorn All womanish revenge, I grant thy Suit. Within an hour, (for which time I commend you To your most free occasions) in this spot I shall expect you. Herodn- I will meet thee here. (exit with Halak) Auga- Is this well done, my Son? did you not tell me Your law and your religion was revenge? Abidh- True, but your Son is taught to weild the sword, Not point the dagger: Be content, good Mother, He falls opposing, or he lives to yeild. Auga- Well, we shall leave you to your better thoughts. Come, good Bethanor, I must hold some talk With you in private. (exit Augusta) Bethr- Oh, persist in mercy! If you have hope of Happiness in Heaven, Or heart's content on Earth, I do conjure you, Lift not your hand against Herodian's life. (Exit) Abidah Peace to your Councils! when advisers point So wide asunder, and are pois'd in weight So equal, well it is I am not bound To either's will, but can pursue my own. (Affghar enters to Abidah) Welcome, my faithful Arab; hast thou done As I commanded? is the Squadron ready With all appointments for Glaphyra's Safety, That our best means can furnish? Affgr- All is ready: Each Arab by his neighing courser stands Ready to vault at once into the Saddle, And start upon the Signal. Abidh- Faithfull Affghar, You bear no slight commission: To your care I give a sacred trust, defenceless beauty And virgin innocence. Remember, Soldier, You guard a Lady, whom Abidah loves, The charge of honour and the test of friendship. And look! Glaphyra's parting form appears! Must I renounce those beauties? painful task! Hah! she descries me; and with quicken'd step Turns to avoid meâHaste, brave Arab, haste And bring herâSay, that we command her presence. (Exit Affghar What have I said? Command! is that the language Of love and soft persuasion? Oh, for words To aid this last attempt! How is't that absent And meditating on her, I can find Discourse for ages, now she's in my Sight My thoughts obey no order, and I'm lost? (Glaphyra enters) Glapa- They tell me, Sir, that you command my presence. These ensigns of authority bespeak Your title to command and I obey. Abidh- I pray you pardon me; I am not practis'd Like the soft sons of idleness and ease, To lull your ears with flattery: my rude voice Crackt with the shoutings of the clamourous chace Ne're sounded loves soft pitch; some happier Youth Pours those melodious accents in your Ear Whilst mine grate harsh and hateful. Glapa- Have you said, And may I now depart? Abidh.- A moment's patienceâ Knew I the art to please you and controul These rustic manners, I woud die to gain it: But call it instinct, call it the misfortune Of my wild training, I was never born To stoop to disappointment and the insults Of a successful Rival. Oft I've driven The spotted panther to his desperate stand, Yet never brook'd I a companion's Spear To strike my destin'd Victim and arrest The savage trophies I had held in chase. Glapa- This I beleive; it now remains to pay My grateful thanks and part. Abidh- I do perceive A plain unvarnish'd man, who cannot cull And candy o're his words with flattery's froth, Is this vain world's derision. Fair Glaphyra, What have I done, that every look betrays Impatience to be gone, each word you utter, Whilst it augments desire, confirms despair? Glapa- Some angel of deliverance be my rescue! Abidh- Have you forgot how once in glowing terms You bade me, If I e're became a King, That I shoud take fair Virtue by the hand, Lead her to Courts, to Councils, on the throne Make her my Consort? I am now a King: I take fair Virtue by the handâAscend my throne! There sit enshrin'd like a protecting Angel, With guardian wings outspread and fost'ring smiles Shelt'ring the frighted tribes, who start aghast From my fierce manners and coarse rugged looks. Now what replies Glaphyra Glapa- Plainly thusâ Tis not your looks deter me, for they are honest; Tis not your manners, for I love sincerity; But tis forbidden by our destiny That we shoud meet. You think your Crown will tempt me, Therein you wrong the daughter of a King, Whose glory once, tho' now eclisps'd and lost, Dazzled the Nations. For my Life, tis your's: Take it, tis in your hands; t'was your own gift; You wanted then no monitor for Virtue, A deed so noble spoke a noble nature! Abidh- I know not yet what Nature I am of; My course I've held uncheckt; nor ever yet, Till yesterday's reproof, did old Bethanor Controul me by a word. Or give me cause Why you reject my suit, or give your Heart. Glapa- I have no Heart to give: It is another's. Abidh- Death to my Soul! Anothers! do you own it? Where is the peasant Slave, that dares to thwart A monarch in his Choice? Glapa- Where is the Slave? Not in thy power, as I am, prais'd be Heaven! Where is the peasant-Slave? Where thou art now Usurper, there he shoud be, there he shall If Justice aids his Armâ Abidh- Give me his name. Glapa- HerodianâHah! it strikes you then, it flashes Confusion to your Pride Abidh- Welcome, Revenge! Hence from my Heart, Remorse! Your lover dies: Herodian dies this hour! Glapa- Where? How? by whom? Abidh- Here, at this instant, in your very sightâ Fast in my toils I hold him: He is hereâ Nay, if you brave me to itâHoa! my Guard! Glapa- Angels of mercy save him! (She faints and falls) Abidh- Hah! she falls! Help, Help to Save her!âIs it you, Bethanor? Hence from my Sight. Bethanor enters and attempts to raise Glaphyra from the Ground. Bethr- What have you done? Abidh.- Away! Come not between me and my wrath, old Man, You tread upon your Grave. Bethr- I care not, strike! But hear me first. I've been your father, Sir, And I will be your friend: Say what has pass'd? Speak, I demand your Answer. Abidh- Urge me not; The Vessel of my peace is tempest-torn, Whelm'd by contending passions, rackt with Love, And gulph'd in dark despair. Bethr- Are you a Man? Support her, raise her to the Air! and see, It fans the fading Lillies into life: Open a fresh sweet flower! Abidh- Look on that form! Life, Empire, Happiness, in her they center, With her they're lost. Herodian hath her Heart. Glapa- A sight of Horror! save me from that Murderer Bethr- Dost thou hear that? Glapa- Let him not speak to me, His very voice can kill; his Eye looks death; Murder is in his touchâLike Moloch's Idol See where he stands in robes besmear'd with blood, A Brother's bloodâ Abidh- Am I this Monsterâfly! Ascend my Chariot; to their utmost speed Urge my Arabian steeds; outstrip the winds. Terror will lend thee wings, aversion strength To fly this Monster, this blood-sprinkled Moloch, Whose very touch can murder. Go! Depart! Glapa- No, I'll remain and share Herodian's death: No force shall tear me from him. The confession, Your tyranny extorted, has undone him. Ill fated prince, to fall into your snares! He told me not of this, conceal'd his purpose And bade me to expect his quick return. Fatal concealment! Why did you prolong My misery with life? I had a weapon, And coud have died at once. Abidh.- No, twas my chance, The happiest of my Life, to save Glaphyra. What deed so glorious hath Herodian done? I am no boaster, yet I'd fain be told. What this high-favour'd Youth woud act or suffer For thy lov'd sake, more than Abidah dares. Glapa- What he hath done woud ask the day to tell. Me and my aged father, the last Wreck Of Syria's captive Kings, did he redeem From the most abject State of human misery, That Rome's proud tyrant coud inflict upon us. What he woud do, if further thou dost ask, Be patient and I'll tellâWere he the Monarch, As thou art, of JudÃ¦a, and thyself The rival of his empire and his love, He woud disdain the base Assassin's part, Nor plunge his dagger in a brother's bosom. Oh, excellent Bethanor, kneel with me! And join thy prayers to him, to Heaven for mercy. Abidh- Stand up! impetuous tho' I am and fierce, I am a man, and not a dÃ¦monârise! Bethr- Glaphyra, take my counsel and withdraw. I am your advocate, your pledge for safety: I will prevail or perish. Nay retire! Glaphyra retires. Abidh- Who dares to say retire? Bethr- Bethanor dares: Bethanor once again his breast opposes To a fell madman's rage. Abidh- Die then, thou Traitor! Draws his Sword Bethr- Stop, Parricide, you kill your fatherâ Abidh- Hah! drops his Sword Bethr- By the eternal Truth, I am thy father! Abidh- Merciful God, support me! Bethr- Oh, my Son, There was no way but this. You've lost an Empire, But you have Sav'd a soul. Abidh- My blood recoils And freezes at my heart. If you're my father, Why did you practise on me to deceive, And train me up to hopes beyond my reach? Bethr- Say rather why did you decline from Virtue? Had you rul'd others as you rul'd yourself, What anarchy had follow'd? Oh Abidah! I had been secret still, had you been constant. Did I not warn you to abstain from blood, From Prince Heroidan's blood? By every name Sacred in Earth and Heaven I did conjure you; But t'was in vain, and nowâ Abidh- I will have proof: This may be counterfeited: True or false, Still there must be deceit: I will have proof, E're I let loose the Sceptre I have grasp'd. If I take now your word for truth, I take Your whole life past for rank dissimulation. Therefore nor words nor oaths shall win belief, Nothing but demonstration shall compell it. Bethr- Follow me then and you shall have conviction Such as shall put to silence every doubt Ambition can oppose. Abidh- Lead on: I follow. (End of the 3.d Act)</field>

Auga- Come you must put aside this distant air, And hear a woman to a woman speak Without reserve the language of the heart. Tho' past my youthful hours, washt out with tears My faded form and wan with dungeon groans, T'was once my chance to win a Monarch's Heart And scale the glittering summit of Ambition. You by the same ascent with fairer claim May reach the same bright prize: Our Son adores you Ambition puts a Sceptre in your hand, And Love awaits you on JudÃ¦a's throne. Glapa- I'll not affect with maidenish reserve To combat your conjecture: Truth demands A fair reply; And be that Truth my witness! That never from the sad distressful moment, In which your Son first found me to this hour Have I by word or look or female Art Attempted his Affections. Auga- Give me pardon If I cut short this prelude, and declare In hearing of high Heaven, that you alone, If each fair form, which this wide world contains, Coud here assemble, you alone, Glaphyra, Have my consenting Voice. Glapa- Impossible. Auga- Give me your hand: If there be truth in Heaven, My heart is with my tongue Glapa- It must not be. I am the Child of Solitude: Your throne Is circled with ambitious Beauty, Chuse From that fair Circle some less humble Maid. Auga- Now I can read your heart and solve the doubts, That trouble the calm Current of your thoughts. You see a rude unpractis'd son of Nature Encompass'd with temptations, and you paint Youth's giddy bark with swelling Sails outspread, Driv'n by the breath of flattery on the rocks Of pleasure's faithless shore: You see our Son Press with a trembling weight the unsteady throne: Fix it, Glaphyra; tis your own, confirm it! Your power is Sovereign o're his Soul, exert That power, and share the Empire you shall Save: Glapa- Never, no power on Earth, not ev'n the force Of Fate itself can drag me to the throne. No, rather let me empty all these veins And wring them out with torture drop by drop. Auga- Amazement! what has fixt your heart so firmly? Is it another's? Are you wedded? Speak! Glapa- Now as your Heart e're felt the kindling touch Of love, of pity; by your Sex's softness, By a fond mothers feelings I conjure you Save a devoted Creature, who will meet A thousand deaths, but never never yeild A Heart already plighted and betray The dear dear Youth, for whom alone she lives. Auga- I'm lost in wonderâSure Abidah loves youâ Glapa- Alas! how fatally! Auga- He offers Marriageâ Glapa- I do confess. Auga- Your Honour he has rescued, Your person snatcht from ruin worse than deathâ This you rememberâ Glapa- Heav'n reward him for it With never-dying glory! may his throne In wisdom and in mercy be Establish'd And in the Arms of some superior Fair Endear'd by beauty and by truth ennobled, Whilst I am distant far, may He forget That e're Glaphyra's name provok'd a Sigh! Auga- Tis well: I leave you to your choice; nay more, I'll further your deliverance, aid your wishes: Say only, was our Son now on the brink Of sure destruction, and your word coud save him, Woud you not speak the word? Glapa- Explain your purpose. How is it that my word can save Abidah? Auga- Silence that self-opposing pride of Honour! You only have the power. Tell him tis Madness Not to destroy the Rival of his throne. Glapa- O Horror! is it thus that I must save him? By tempting him to murder? Aug.a- No, tis Justice, Tis self-defence to killâ Glapa- Oh stop the word! Do not pronounce the name. Auga- Why not pronounce it? Is magic in the name? will't raise a Spirit? Play not this part with me, nor fool your Judgment With Old Bethanor's lessons: Well I know Tis he that teaches you this farce of pity. Of this be sure; Herodian diesâ Glapa- Oh stay! Turn and revoke the word. You see before you The last sad Relict of a line of Kings, Syria's dethroned Monarchs. At your feet I cast my prostrate corpse, here to expire If you reject my Suit, and deaf to pity Murder (Oh! shall I speak the name?) Herodian. Auga- If I reject your suit? Yes, with the Scorn That you did mine. Away, weak suppliant! (exit) (As Augusta breaks off from Glaphyra, She falls to the Ground.) (Herodian enters) Herodn- What do I see? what prostrate form is this? Save me; good Angels, save me! tis Glaphyra. Oh, agony of Soul! my better Life, Look up; Herodian calls. Glap.a- Herodian! Yes, Tis He! All-gracious Heaven, he lives, he lives! I clasp him to my heart. (She rises and They embrace) Herodn- In this Embrace Moments expand to Ages: Oh, these arms Might recompense a life of lengthen'd misery. But tell me, satisfy my anxious mind, Why you've Exchang'd a hospitable roof For this detested Mansion. Glapa- Tell me rather Why did you turn aside your purpos'd Course And run upon these toils, which murder spreads To catch your sacred Life? Why did you enter A bloody Rival's Court? Ah, why deceive me? Herodn- In the fond hope that I might save a mother, Entomb'd alive in darkness, I adventur'd; My father then was livingâbut Oh, answer me, What chance so fatal brings Glaphyra hither? Sure he was faithful, to whose care I left thee. Glapa- Apparent sanctity had whiten'd o're The Villain's outward favor, but his heart Was spotted as the mortal pestilence. This Arab Prince, that now usurps thy Crown, Journeying thro' Mameleck, preserv'd my honor From Violation, and in happy moment Buried his ponyard in the Villain's heart. Herodn- Did he? reward him Heav'n! with glory crown him, And let him reign unrivall'd on my throne, Ye recompencing Angels! Hah! he comesâ (Abidah enters) Welcome, my more than Brother, my Preserver! Such pray'rs, as Gratitude pours forth to Heaven, When the right hand of mercy is made visible In the last anguish of despair, such praises Do I pour forth to thee, thou godlike youth! Abidh- Whence are these transports? how have I deserv'd them, Or is it all but mockery? Herodn- Behold, Behold in that fair glass the bright reflection, From which I catch these transports! Glapa- Oh forbear! You rush upon destruction. Herodn- What destruction Have I to dread? I have forsworn Ambition; I have renounc'd the Crown: Tis thine, Abidah: I ask no other blessing but Glaphyra. Her thou hast sav'd. We are no rivals now. Glapa- Alas, mistaken man, you still are rivals. Herodn- Death to my Soul! He'll not oppose me here. Were the Worlds empire mine, I'd yeild it to him; What woud he more? Abidh- Be still and hear me speak. May not my Eyes be sensible as your's To beauty's fair perfection? What is empire, Which you so freely offer? What is power But mere conspicuous wretchedness, when she Nor shares my Empire, nor obeys my power? Herodn- With pity I survey your painful struggle; For sure I am your noble Soul abhors To force that innocence your justice sav'd: Or if you did, to force is to destroy, And so the damning Crime defeats itself. Unarm'd and at your mercy as I stand, Your Sword this moment might transfix my heart, Yes, and your savage mother woud applaud you, What then? will that possess you of Glaphyra? Will she, whose constancy rejects the hero, Love and accept the Murderer? Let her answer Set all your benefits in fair Array, (Great, generous I confess them) let Glaphyra Weigh them with Candour and decide betwixt us. Glapa- Why was I born, just Heav'n to this hard fate? If gratitude, O Princes, held the Scale, So equally 'tis pois'd, there were no choice; The Beam of Justice coud not be more level. But Love weighs all things in a partial ballance, Crowns, treasures, kingdoms, nay the world itself Mounts like a feather, when the heart opposes. Cease then, Abidah, cease to urge thy suit, And sentence me at once to life or death. Abid.h- Live then, but never let me hear your thanks. Let not your Eyes light on me, if we meet; Teach them aversion, give your features horror, That I may shun you, Go; prepare your Spirit For happiness, but make not me your witness: Expect your Lover, tho' the deed be death, I'll send him to your Arms. Go to your Chamber: If it be possibleâwe meet no more. Exit Glaphyra Herodn- Rome in her days of freedom never knew Virtue like thine. Abidh- Nay, but forbear to thank me: No triumph, no rejoicingâmute as death. The Sun is Sunk and Solemn Eve succeeds; And I must borrow of the Night an hour For Meditation's melancholy task. Affghar! Affghr- What wills my Prince? Abidh- My gallant friend, To you and your brave Arabs I confide The nightly keeping of this Royal Youth. Be diligent, be wakeful on your watch, For danger will be stirring Affgr- We defy it Abidh- Now part without a wordâTo Ahab's Tower, You'll have safe conduct; there you'll meet a Mother. Exit Herodian with Guards (Augusta enters hastily) Auga- Was that Herodian parted hence? Abidh- T'was He. But now let things of lesser moment sleep Unquestion'd, till one awful doubt is solv'd. Am I indeed your Son? Augusa- Hah! who denies it? Abidh- Bethanor. Auga- Strike him, ye avenging fires! Abidh- He says, and execrates the fatal hour, That foil'd and mourning o're a dying child, With tempting gifts you urg'd him to impose Me, then his new-born infant, on the King: That his best hopes then drooping and his fortunes Far in decay, he to the glittering bribe Consented, and, to strict concealment bound By solemn Oaths, took your Expiring babe, And gave, Oh shame to Nature! gave you his. Auga- And this your weak credulity beleives. Abidh- Tis solemnly depos'd. Auga- Aye, when did villainy Want words or oaths to vouch for its own falsehood? When did the Traitor first impose this on you? Abidh- When I was high in wrath and woud have slain him. Auga- Oh that you had! why tis too palpable; A lye invented on the moment's spur To save his coward life. Abidh- Coud he invent it? Are there such things in practise? I'll not think it: He must be honest; else all men be lyars. Auga- And yet but now you said you woud have kill'd him; Did you then think him honest? Abidh- Guilty passion Blinded my reason, and he nobly stemm'd The furious torrent, that had whelm'd me else In blood and violation. Auga- But for him You had destroy'd Herodian. Abidh- I confess it. Not for he was the rival of my power, But as the favor'd Lover of Glaphyra. Auga- What do I hear? the lover of Glaphyra? Abidh- But I have master'd that rebellious passion: I have subdu'd those tyrants of the Soul Love and Ambition, and am now a King. Auga- Shame to such Kings! Away with such advisers! The glaring falsehood now convicts itself: To sink your high-born energy of Soul By peasant principles, and to melt down The bright imperial Ore, of which I form'd You, To his base dross, was the vile artifice Of this old traitorâBut be rul'd by me: Before an hour shall pass we'll meet again And face to face convict him of the lye; You shall possess the Syrian; the true Parent Gives joy, gives rapture; the false father chills Your generous ardour with the freezing maxims Of cold forbearance; rules unfit for Kings, Abidh- Your words have caught my heart, as lightnings catch The blazing Stubble, hot with summer Suns. I am the sport of passion. Auga- For the present Leave me, so please you: In an hour we'll meet And more at large Converse. Abidh- I shall Expect you (Exit) Auga- Why this was fairly carriedâNow, Bethanor, If thou escapst me now, my Life for thine. Approach, Serapion! (Serapion enters) Serapn- What woud the Queen? I live but to obey her. Auga- Slave, methinks Thou'rt an Egyptian; When our royal Herod Met Antony and his imperial Mistress At Samosata, thou wast in the train Of that fair Reveller: T'was then, Serapion, Thy better Stars prefer'd thee to my Service. Serapn- Blest be the time! If thou my royal Lady, Bear'st it in mind, how shoud thy slave forget it? Auga- Men of thy cast, they say, will promise fair And shrink from the performance: Tell me now, If I were haunted with a walking Spirit, Whom I woud lay to rest, dar'st thou administer A spell to quiet it? Serapn- I dare do anything, That thou dar'st counsel. Auga- Nay, thou shalt not feed On airy promisesâHere, take this jewel:â What, man; accept it. Serapn- My thrice-bounteous Mistress, There needs not this to bind me to thy Service. Auga- That stone might grace the diadem of CÃ¦sar; Yet is it but a foretaste of my bounty. Be faithful, and thou shalt be drench'd in gold; Steep'd to the lips in treasure, blazing bright, Like Mammon's altar, pil'd with glittering ore, The offerings of Idolatry to Sin. Serapn- Who bleeds for this? Auga- Bethanor. Serapn- Hah! Bethanor? Auga- Doth it revolt thee? In the western Tower He sleeps this night. Thou art most private there, Know'st every passage and canst thread the Maze, That darkling winds around the vaulted pile, Commodious for the deed thou tak'st in hand. Serapn- Say'st thou this Night?âHe sleeps his last. Auga- But swear, Swear to perform it! Serapn- By each sacred thing That can record or sanctify my oath, I swear to attempt the deed, which thou commandest. Auga- Tis well, tis well! You medicine my Sick soul Pouring the balm of Comfort on the wounds Ingratitude has made. He falls! He dies! Thy dagger rives his heart; and whilst the Furies Quaff his devoted blood, all Hell shall ring With loud Ovations o're his Sinking Soul. (End of the 4t h Act.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 5 An Antique Vestibule with passages leading to different Apartments. Herodian and Glaphyra enter under separate Guards. Herodian Here we must part. To that commission'd Spirit, Which o're the virgin innocence of Sleep Keeps his angelic watch, I do commend thee. Glapa- Oh that the night were past! To part is dreadful; The very scene inspires my soul with horror: I doubt, I tremble. Day ne're enter'd here, Hope, chearful Offspring of the morn, n'ere dwelt; But murder, ambusht in these gloomy Cells, Brooding in midnight silence wakeful sits With list'ning Ears, till from yond antique tower His Centinel the Raven croaks the Knell, His Signal for our doom Herodn- Nor yet despair, Nor yet, confiding in our promis'd hope, Be careless of your safety. Glapa- Oh Herodian, What can I do defenceless? See'st thou not This Arab Youth how he is tost with passions? Fierce as the gust that tears his sandy Wilds, And fiery as the Sun, whose burning Orb Withers parcht Nature up: His wavering Mind Now points to mercy, now with quick recoil Drives like a wreck before the hellish blast Of murderous revenge. Herodn- I have survey'd him With anxious scrutiny, and trembling own The force of all your fears: Therefore, Glaphyra, Be arm'd for the occasion; better t'were And more beseeming of your princely birth, To fall untainted, than Survive disgrace. There is a horrid thing that harbours hereâ How shall I utter it? Glapa- Proceed: Unfold it. Herodn- If his seducing Mother shoud assail, And passion's raging heat shoud urge him on To Violationâ Glapa- Horrible to thought! Give me the means of Death! if not, I'll force them From Nature's last resource. Herodn- Oh! nobly thought, Offspring of Kings! to great atchievements born And more than Roman dignity: Behold! I have a Weapon Shewing a Dagger. Glapa- Give it me: Tis welcome. I love, I reverence the manly gift; And doubt me not, I have an arm to guide, A bosom to receive it. Now farewell! Come, Sirs, dispose me where your King commands. I'm ready; lead the wayâOnce more farewell! Herodn- Rememberâ Glapa- Fear me not. Herodn- Good Angels guard you. Exeunt severally guarded. (Abidah enters alone) Abidh- Tis madnight: Now the darkling Imps are busy, And couching close beside the Ear of sleep Whisper their hellish fancies: Horrid dreams Are now at work; Now Ghosts may stalk unchalleng'd By Morn's shrill Centinel. How now!âwhat thoughts Rush on my mind?âAvaunt, ye devilish Agents! Strengthen my soul, just Heavn!âThere sleeps Herodian. What then?âthere let him sleepâLet him awake Tomorrow and be blestâOh! blest too much!â There, there that passage leads him to Glaphyra: And I, I must not bend my Eyes that way, Outcast from Hope and LifeâOn Him the Sun Laughing shall rise; round him the dancing hours Shall tread their sportive measures, His the Day, And every DayâNight and despair are mine. (Augusta enters) Auga- How now, my Son! well met. This solemn privacy And midnight silence recommend the moment For serious meditation. Hast thou thought On what I told thee and at leasure weigh'd In thy mind's ballance what a trivial thing Weak pity is? a toy to please a baby, A Coward canting Virtue?âThou hast stept Up to the very threshold of thy Hope; But one Step more and Hope becomes Possession. Wilt stop, go back; recoil from thy good fortune? Sure thou wilt not, my Son. There Sleeps thy Rival! So let not thy Revenge. Abidh- He is my Brother. Auga- But not thy Mother's Son. Oh that the blood, Which thou deriv'st from my maternal veins Might with my Spirit touch thy filial Heart! Look yet againâbehold! that entrance leads To Love, to Beauty, to Glaphyraâ Abidh- Hah! Can it be possible? In very truth Art thou my Mother? Can such direful thoughts Visit a matron's bosom? Auga- Woud I save A Son from madness, from despair and death? Take Nature's answer from a Mothers lips; I woudâCan Mercy point that saving way? Tis not in Mercy's powerâTo Justice then Turn thy revolving thoughts; inquire of Reason, Ask if tis fitting to supplant a Son, To give a Son's fair birthright to his Rival, And sacrifice thy life to save Herodian's: Does Heaven prescribe such Mercy to a Mother? I'll not beleive it does. I, like thyself, Was once weak pity's dupe, and mark what follow'dâ Twenty long Years of dark Imprisonmentâ If the Example terrifies, avoid it, And profit by Experience dearly purchas'd. Abidh- Tis not my principle to spare my Rival, And to resign Glaphyra is to die: But still the manly purpose of my Soul Melted at beauty's tear; it struck like magic; From the fair fountain of Glaphyra's Eyes The supplicating drop of pity fell, And from my Heart, tho' bleeding fresh with wrongs, Revenge, like an exorcis'd dÅmon, fled. Now it comes back, rebounds upon my breast With tenfold force resistlessâHah! tis Hereâ Welcome, ye black Associates of my Soul, Murder and Violation! Rise ye furies And twine your snaky folds about my Heart; For it is all your own. Lo, I am arm'd! Avoid the ChamberâVengeance be my Guide! Auga- Now, now, my Son, if thou woud'st be a Monarch, Thou handlest that, which in a brave Man's grasp, Will not be idle long. Abidh- Hark! He approachesâ Auga- He comes, thy rival comes! and on thy brow, Prophetic of his fate, sit stern Revenge And frowning Resolution. Oh, strike home! And if thy wrongs suffice not to direct Thy forceful Sword to his proud hostile Heart, Thus let me strain thee to my throbbing bosom And add my rage to thine. Abidh- Enough! Depart. Exit Augusta. I'll not dispatch him SleepingâHoa. Come forth; Herodian, come forth! Hah! what art thou? Bethanor! (Bethanor enters follow'd by Serapion) Bethr- Oh defend me! I am wounded. See, the Assassin comes! Abidh- This to his Heart! Serapion falls. Die, blood Hound, like a Dog I spurn theeâDie! There lie and howl. Bethr- Oh! I am slain my Sonâ Support me!âAsk that Ruffian, if he lives, Who set him on the deed. Abidh- Speak, if thou can'st: Answer, thou bloody Slave, who set thee on To kill this good old Man? Serapn- Art thou Abidah? Art thou the King? Abidh- Abidah and the King. Serapn- Then I confess thy Mother did employ me To kill Bethanor. With a poison'd dagger I struck him; If he bleeds, tho but a drop, He diesâI can no moreâOh Horror! Horror! (dies) Abidh- Speak quickly, do you bleed, O fatal Sight! Bethr- Lament not: Tis Heavn's JusticeâI submit. Abidh- Now by the awfull presence of thy God, Where thou shalt soon appear, I do adjure thee, Give me the truthâAm I thy Son, Bethanor; Or did'st thou practise on my credulous Spirit A Merciful deception to divert My vengeance and preserve Herodianâ? Bethr- No; With my last breath now parting I declare I've spoke the truthâAugusta's Princely Son, Whose name you counterfeit, died in his birth, And poverty corrupted my weak Virtue To substitute my Infant in his place. Thy Mother, now a Saint in Heav'n, but liv'd To bless her new-born Murderer and Expir'd: Had she not died, I had not been thus guilty. Can'st thou forgive me? wilt thou not with Curses Load thy sad father? Abidh- Mark, if I will curse theeâ Judge of all human Hearts, absolve my father! Blanch with his contrite tears this Crimson Sin, And white as Snow record him in the book Of Life eternal! Give me now your blessing. Bethr- Ye interceeding Angels, who address The throne of mercy for imperfect Man, Make this dear Youth your care, confirm his Virtue And grant him life, if life be innocence; But if dishonour, misery await him, Waft him yet guiltless on your wings to glory! Abidh- Help then to fit me for this towring flight, By throwing off my load of guilty passions: If you have Love or pity at your heart For me, your Son confest, be now a Father; And with parental firmness point this Sword Against this recreant bosom; no way else Remains to save me, Tis not me you kill Tis GuiltâOh, stab the DÃ¦mon at my Heart! Bethr- Thy sword was in thy hand; thy visage wild; I trembled at the Sight: What was thy purpose? Abidh- I'll not belie my purpose. Dire revenge Had turn'd my heart to stone; this midnight hour, This solitary silence, mad desires And prompt occasion, aided by the Counsels Of Hell's infernal Tempter, all assail'd And shook my Constancy; with ready sword I flew to meet my Rival; for I scorn'd To kill him Sleeping, and I call'd him forth To equal Combatâfor my Virtue Struggledâ Bethr- Where is Glaphyra? Abidh- Name not herâThat passage Leads to her Chamber. Bethr- Hah! your looks alarm me. Not name her! Sure you have not dar'd to Spoil The holy shrine of Chastityâ Abidh- Oh Horror! May every Guardian Spirit of the Night Shelter her sleeping innocence! in Act I'm free, in meditation curst. But sure he hears me not: his Sightless Eyeballs Glaze with the pangs of deathâHe fallsâHe dies! Bethanor sinks on the Ground. Oh, speak to me, My father! Affghar! Guards! Haste, haste, my friends and bring Herodian forth, Glaphyra tooâdelay not for a moment (Exeunt Guards. Lift up your Eyes awhile: Look on your Sonâ Behold a deed of justice, e're you close Their trembling lidsâAh no!âConvulsion tears His labouring heartâIt rises to his throat; He gasps; he writhes in anguishâHe expires Bethanor dies. (Glaphyra brought in by Affghar &amp;c Glapa- Where will you force me? Off! let go my arm. I will advance no furtherâGrace defend me! Abidah?âHeav'ns what dying Man is that? Why do you drag me to this Scene of blood? Bethanor!âYes, tis HeâInhuman Tyrant, You've murder'd my defender. Abidh- Peace: Be Silent! Wound not the Night with Shrieks, lest ev'n the Dead Shoud hear them, and his Spirit, hovering o're us, Drop from the wing, and cower into the Grave. Glapa- Another bleeding Trunk! discovering Serapion another Sea Of human gore, that with it's Crimson tide Eddies and [broms?] around my trembling Steps. Let me depart, or See me die at once draws her dagger. Abidh- Stop, Stop her desperate hand! Herodian rushes in, follow'd by a Guard. Herodn- Oh, save Glaphyra! Or let me share her deathâIs this thy promise, Monster, is this thy faith?âAugusta comes! The pavement streams with murder, and the fiends Flock to the Scent of blood. Augusta enters and speaks to Abidah. Auga- Degenerate peasant! Base Parricide! thou hast undone thy Mother. Abidh- My Mother!â Auga- Mariamne lives. I met her; Yes, like an Adder in my path, she crost me; And 'tis thy doing Traitor. Abidh- Now, brave Arabs! Now, Affghar, do thy friend a noble service, And seize that Murderess, She is not my Mother. Guards approach to Seize her. Auga- Ruffians, avaunt! Sayst thou I'm not thy mother? Then know me for thy Queen; nor dare to assault The majesty of Judah. Abidh- Lo, where lies The Assassin you employ'd to kill Bethanor! Know t'was my hand that smote him, t'was my father You and your murderer slew. Now to Herodian, JudÃ¦a's rightful monarch, I commit you. The dungeon, from whose life-devouring jaws I snatcht his Mother, yawns to give you welcome. Prince, you once told me, when I call'd you Brother, I humbled you to what you proudly deem'd Your meanest titleâproudly did I say? T'was justly deem'd, for I am not your Brother. I'm not Augusta's Son, nor Judah's king. Herodn- Nay, but you are a King; tis now you reign Enthron'd above all earthly Potentates; Tis now with pride I own you for my brother. Abidh- Crowns I can abdicate without a Sigh; The tryal of my Soul, the painful Struggle, Which Honour must at life's expence Endure, That is the test of VirtueâOh, Glaphyra!â Auga- Pause for a moment! Hear me speak apartâ I yet will Save thee: I confess Bethanor Hath told thee truth: I own thou art nor mine Nor Herod's Son; and therefore this Herodian Is not thy brother; Nature hath no plea Which urges thee to Spare himâArt thou mad To sacrifice revenge; ambitionâlove? Can'st thou survey that beauty and resign it? The Secret of thy birth dies with thy father: Send but Herodian where Bethanor is, And it shall rise no more They Confer apart. Glapa- Herodian, mark, Mark how that tempter winds about his Heart! See, see, he faulters! Look his colour changes! Strengthen his Constancy, all-saving Goodness, Or we are lost. Herodn- Tis a tremendous moment: Remember I have arm'd thee: Be prepar'd! Glapa- Firm as the faith of Martyrs I abide. Now, now the terror comes. Abidh- Tempt me no more: I'll die before I'll do it, Hah! behold My father's corpse; His wounds burst out afresh; Tho dead, his blood yet speaks, Away, Corrupter! The DÃ¦mon, that is in thee, gives this Counsel: Hence with that Murderess! bear her to the dungeon When Mariamne issued. Auga- Stop; Reflect Not to a Dungeonâthat has been endur'd; My Soul yet unsubdu'd has stood that trial; And wearied it's tormentors: Oh tis malice Weak woman's malice; you shoud kill outright Murder your benefactress; Come, dispatchâ When I enthron'd a Beggar I deserv'd it. But in a Dungeon, in a living Tomb Imprison not my Spirit, lest again It may break forth to Scorn and to defy you As it does now. Abidh- Why did you kill my father? Auga- Why did I kill him? why did he betray me? Why did I killâthy father.âdost thou ask? Because I was a Queen, and he a Traitorâ Because I held it better to enjoy Life on a throne, than languish in a Dungeon, Becauseâbut I have causes infinite, You have but one, and that's ingratitude, To which and to your folly I bequeath you: Settle my fateâI'll talk with you no longer. (Exit) Abidh- Come hither, fair oneâfear me not; approach! That I have lov'd, to desperation lov'd thee, It is my torment, not my crime: The conflict Was sharp, but I have conquer'd. Go, be free! Go to thy heart's first choice! Herodian take her; Now I've no more to give Glapa- Oh, with what praises, What thanks shall I address thee? Abidh- Give no praise: Spare me a little Earth, and let my bones Sleep by my father'sâNow deliverance comes: This to my Heartâ(Stabs himself) Glapa- Help, help! he has kill'd himself! Herodn- O Horror, Horror! unexpected Stroke! My Life to save himâ Abidh- Ah, you knew not me. My Spirit is too proud to be imprison'd In an ignoble case. It bends its flight To realms, where disappointment never enters, Where love is universal as the day That brightens thro' Eternity: Farewell! There we shall meet, GlaphyraâAhâno moreâ My Eyes lose sight of theeâtis pastâI die. (Dies) Glapa- Oh horrible! He diesâafflicting Sight Alas that no preventive hand coud stop The rapid stroke of DeathâWhat noble fruit Of growing Virtue with its native Trunk Is now cut down and strew'd upon the grave! Judge him with mercy, Heaven! He was not taught Thy precepts of forbearance: Nature's Child Will with the God of Nature meet acceptance. Herodn- Well may we mourn his most untimely fate, When tears are all that we can now bestow: Yet what we can we'll payâSepulchral Honours With royal Rites as to a King and Brother. Further, in memory of his last request, We will entomb his father at his side, Whilst these his virtuous Acts, and the sad story Of his unhappy Love shall stand recorded In living Chronicles, to be a theme For Ages yet unborn of future praise.
