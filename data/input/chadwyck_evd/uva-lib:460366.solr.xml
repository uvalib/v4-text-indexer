      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —A Hill near the Scotish Camp. Enter Wallace, Comyn, De Graham, Stewart. Wall. The sun is almost down;— We must proceed no farther from the camp: The eye has here sufficient range to mark The advantage of the ground. Let each, then, freely his best counsel give— What order should be ta'en against the attack Which soon we must sustain. Com. Wallace, I've little heart to give advice. The chiefest of our barons have withdrawn, And sworn submission to the English king;— But, if I must my counsel give,—retreat Seems for the present best. Wall. Retreat!—and let fire, famine, murder, Perform as on a stage their several parts, While we look idly on, and weep the while!— 'Tis time for flight when we have fought in vain. Com. You do mistake me, and most rashly too: There is some difference 'twixt retreat and slight. No man durst e'er, till now, hint a suspicion, That fear could weigh a feather in the scale Of Comyn's judgement: Fear! the field will prove; To-morrow's field; for now, 'stead of advising, I do insist, that, if we're not assail'd, We make th' assault, and that I, in my right, As nearest to the royal blood of Scotland, Lead on the van. I will not be gainsaid. Wall. Most strangely you misconstrue— I never meant— Com. I care not what you meant; your words would bear That meaning which again I will not name. I vote for battle,—and I lead the van. Stew. Since you're so peremptory 'bout your rights, I must with, or without, your leave, maintain That mine 's the right to lead the vanward on: I am the older soldier: I did join The cause of Scotland, and of liberty, When low, almost past hope: I lifted up The Scotish banners, when they lay all soil'd And trodden in the dust; whilst wary Comyn Waited aloof, until they wav'd triumphant O'er Cambuskenneth field: then did he join. Wall. My friends and fellow-soldiers, I entreat Ye would awhile forget your private claims, And think of Scotland's wrongs: Redress them first, And then think of precedence. Let not your discord risque your country's weal. Were I to stand on right, I might insist, As named protector by the commons' voice, To take the post of honour as my right; But honour's post is close by duty's side. To end dispute,—by virtue of the power To me committed by the public will, It is my will, that neither you, proud Comyn, Nor you, the Stewart, lead to-morrow's battle: That post I trust to you, Sir John De Graham. Com. Wallace, thou know'st full well my power; I can, ev'n with a wave of this right hand, Call off ten thousand of my mountaineers. Those, whom you call your men, or stay or go As pleases best themselves, or their vain dreams Of freedom, country, and such phantasies. In brief, if Stewart, or De Graham, should dare— Or even yourself—to wrest from me my right, That instant from the camp I will withdraw. Wall. By the rood, my will— De Grah. Hear me; 'tis not my wont to shun the post Of danger—yet this once I must decline it: I by your side, my friend, will take my post, (to Wallace. I know how guardless oft you leave yourself, How oft the coward watches for his time To aim a blow, unnoticed of that eye, Which, if it did but only look on him, Would strike him powerless like the lightning's flash. In Wallace Scotland lives; he is the soul That animates, what else Were but a worthless trunk; he is my country; Defending him, I am my country's shield.— As to the point which caused this fierce dispute, I think the counsel which I have to offer Will be acceptable to all. Divide into three parts the Scotish force: Let Comyn range his vassals from the cairn Down to the sheep-folds by the little stream; You, Wallace, from the stream along the plain, Quite in a line with Comyn's front, might range The men of Clydsdale, Renfrew, and the rest Who love to follow you; and 'twixt the squadrons Might be placed the horse: then you, Sir John, Might from the plain up to yon brushwood heights Array the men of pleasant Levendale, Of Enrick, Frune, and those who peaceful dwelt On fair Lochlomond side,— Some never to return. O think, ye chiefs, Of these poor commoners, who've placed their lives As in your hands, relying on the wisdom, And also on the concord of your councils. Let not your private jealousies assist The English sword. The widow's speaking tear, The child, lisping in vain its father's name, Will draw the curse of heaven upon your heads, If, from your strife, evil (as needs it must) Should be the consequence: union alone can save. Be counselled then, brave chieftains, to approve Th' advice which I have ventured to propose. Wall. I do agree. Stew. And I. Com. I'll not say nay. Wall. Then let us to the camp, To give our several orders for the night. Our scouts, ere this, may be returned. The sun is down; I hear the evening hymn: How many—who now kneel upon the turf, And raise their voices to the God of hosts, In supplication, that, if they must fall, He'd for their wives and little ones provide,— Must from to-morrow's vespers absent be! But list: I think I hear good Wishart's voice, As dies the breeze;—this holy bishop's words Will fill with higher confidence the hearts Of all true Scots, will light in each man's eye A brighter gleam of noble daring, Than the united clang of thousand trumpets Sounding the charge. 'Twere good that we were there. Let us go hence. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —Scotish Camp. Wallace in his tent. Enter De Graham, Monteith, and the Maid of Hexeldham in a Scotish hunting dress. Wall. The watches are all stationed right? De Gra. They are: the farthest forty bowshots from the camp. We chose the trustiest, the well-tried men. Enter Wishart. Wall. Welcome, my Lord, I am rejoiced to see you: I heard your voice this night before, and grieved To be beyond the hearing of your words, Which ever and anon, as sunk the breeze, Fell on my longing ear, Like dashing water-falls heard from afar By the wayfaring man when parch'd and faint. Wish. I would you had been present. Never my soul ascended so near heaven, As when I saw ten thousand hands upraised To God, in humble supplication that he'd bless The cause in which they fought—the cause of Man: On every face there seemed as 'twere to play A smile at death: our hearts did burn within us. Marg. O good Lord Bishop, will you please to hear A suit of mine;— That you would strictly charge your son in God, The right hand of his country, not to risque His life so needlessly as oft he does: 'Tis not the leader's part t' expose himself, For in so doing he endangers Many lives.—With you I left my country, (to Wall. And now I bend my bow against my countrymen— What will become of me if you are slain! Wall. If I be slain, sweet Margaret, our father The good Lord Bishop, he will, for my sake, Receive you under his protecting care, And will commend you to the sisterhood Of holy Frances, there to dedicate Yourself to God and to my memory. Wish. O God, avert the day! Wall. But if I live, soon as this war is done, Your plighted vow I will exact, And Wishart will then join our hands, Doubly endear'd, by having fought In the same glorious cause. Marg. But if that you were slain! think you I could Endure to live, or think of God, or heaven, Or aught but you! no, I would not survive; And if my grief did not at once Burst my heart, I'd rush into the thickest of the fight, And fondly hope the self-same sword, Warm with your blood, might pierce my unmailed breast: How sweet to feel it sliding thro' my heart! Wish. Fair lady, do not bode so dismally; But be assured, whatever may betide, My power, my sacred character, my life, Shall ever be devoted to your weal. I loved you for the sake of him by whom You are beloved; but now I love you more Upon your own account. The scanty knowledge Of your story, which from your words I've gleaned, Has made me take a deep concern In your well-being; and in sooth I long Still to know more, that I may love you better. I crave your pardon if I ask amiss, And yours, great Wallace:—my motive, you'll believe, Is not an idle curiosity; For never till this hour did I enquire Into the strange ambiguous tales Which busy tongues were whispering around, But often turned away, and shunned to hear What, from my knowledge of this fair lady, And of your noble soul, I knew could not be true. Mont. No! not one syllable! (aside. Marg. My Lord, you speak so gently, I will answer you. Indeed I've often wished, By telling a plain tale, to clear myself In your esteem, from all surmise of blame: But still, unask'd, my tongue refused its office. Wish. Speak freely now—none but your friends are here. Marg. My father lived beneath the greenwood tree, A banished man, because he disobeyed The shrieve of Cumberland, the king's lieutenant Specially empowered t' array the barons Of the western marches, when first these wars Broke out. He was a gentleman Of good account, and by his mother's side Of Scotish lineage; And he did say this was a cause accurs'd, In which no sword of his should e'er be drawn. 'Twere tedious to relate the sad dispersion And the dire fortunes of our family. I found a shelter in a yeoman's house, Close by the borders of Naworth forest, Among the depths of which my outlawed father Had refuge ta'en, and lived with broken men. My host had been a servant of our house In our prosperity, and he loved my father. He knew each dell and dingle of the woods; He knew my father's haunts; and at the risque Of his own life did often give him aid: And, when he durst not to the woods himself, He sent me, yet a child, to visit him; And there I oft would stay whole summer days. Nor were they idly spent; for there I learned To read, taught by my father, who would carve Sad tales of other times upon the trees. 'Twas then I learnt my skill in archerie; 'Till so expert I was, I could have brought The hawk, high hovering 'bove the highest oaks, Dead at my foot. At last, from use and love I came to like My father's life, and seldom left the woods. I, as the rest, assumed the hunter's habit; And thus some years right merrily we lived. Wish. Where is your father now? Marg. One bitter, bitter, winter day, my steps, Returning from the friendly yeoman's house, Were traced among the snow; and my poor father With seven other foresters were ta'en To Carlisle city, and there savagely Were put to death. I met with cruel grace; I was releas'd; and, passing thro' the city gate, Was doom'd to see—horror!— My father's grey locks waving in the wind. From that day forth I vowed to hate my country; I vow'd to throw away my forlorn life In seeking vengeance. Homeless wandering, I heard the Scots were camp'd at Hexeldham: Thither I hied; their glittering spears Shot thro' my soul a gleam of gloomy joy: I join'd; and with this bow, though rudely form'd, Have ten times o'er revenged my father's slaughter In the blood of Edward's slaves. O, it delights my soul To see my fledge bathed in their blood!— And now, my Lord, if, by this brief narration, I have found favour in your sight, be pleased To second the just suit which I have made To Wallace—not to put to needless hazard His life, so precious to us all. Mont. O curse! (aside. Wish. Compliance with your wish will speak my thanks. In troth then, noble Wallace, let me say, Your duty strongly pleads upon the side Of your fair suitor. A leader never ought— Wall. Most loath am I to interrupt you, father, Nor would I, did I not already know Each argument of weight upon this point. I hold th' example of the chief To be the main spring of the host; 'Tis he ought to display contempt of danger. Let but contempt of danger fire each breast,— That, more than all the wiles of stratagem, Leads on to victory: th' uncounted deeds Of low unnoted men make up the sum Of that success which oft-times is ascribed Falsely to generalship.—Forbear then, sweet! But now 'tis time to part; hie to thy tent, And take some rest. Marg. Good night, my Lord. Wallace, good night. Wish. God have you in his blessing. Marg. Farewell a thousand times. Wall. I will attend you, father, to your tent. [Exeunt Wallace, Wishart, Monteith, and Margaret. SCENE III. —Outside of the Camp. Enter Monteith. Mont. “A thousand times farewell!” O words so kind, so melting kind, So open, undisguis'd! Their looks, so gently interchanged—they blight My soul: To see his brow, That's formed alone to frown in war, Attempt t' unbend, and every martial trait Melt down into a womanish smile! To hear that voice, that's used to speak in thunder, Become the echo of a maiden's sighs! 'Tis pitiful—'tis hateful. And then to see her lavish love on one, Whose mind is all absorb'd i' th' public cause, Whose only mistress used to be his country! And worst of all, to feel myself despised, Or, may be, pitied— Me, who love only her, and for her sake Would hate, do hate my dearest friend, my country, And all that once was loved by me! It is not to be borne, and will not long. I've thought—I have resolved— Wallace, thou art my friend—yet I must ruin thee: To-morrow's battle must be lost, and thou Must die. I'll foster the dissension which I know Prevails among the chiefs; I'll make them leave This champion to himself, and to the fools Who choose to follow him. Wallace will never fly—he must needs fall: Then, his fair Dian, after having spent Th' accustomed time in weeping for his death, Will dry her tears, and 'gin to think his friend A fit successor to her widow'd heart. All must be risqued. I'll to the outskirts of the camp. 'Tis near the time (If by the moon's height I can guess aright) That Comyn set to meet with me; And I'll so work, I will so chafe His tindery spirit! that his rage shall burn, Not to be quench'd except with Wallace' blood; Not to be— Enter a Soldier crossing the Stage. Who comes there? Sold. A friend to Comyn—who questions me? Mont. Sir John Monteith, a friend to Comyn too. Whence and whither? Sold. From Stewart's tents—now to our own. [Exit. Mont. This was the place he fixed—He comes With folded arms, and downward troubled look. He's in a proper frame. Enter Comyn. Com. Is it you, Sir John Monteith? good even. Mont. Good even, Lord of Badenoch.—I fear'd, Lest press'd by th' weight of public business, You had forgot that in the morning You did appoint this meeting. What is the news?— 'Tis rumoured that a council has been held Without the camp—are we to fight to-morrow? What are the mighty Wallace's commands? What post has our great general assigned The Lord of Badenoch? Com. Assigned to me! I'd have you learn, Monteith, I do not fetch and carry at command Of Wallace, or of any man. My will is my sole sovereign. To-morrow, if the enemy attack, I head my men.—No man controuls me! Mont. Yes—while it suits his purposes, Proud Wallace will submit humbly to hold Divided sway; but well I know he means, If once our foreign foe were fairly foiled, To crush and trample down you ancient Lords, And turn a kingmaker; and then he'll name, Supported by the foolish Commons' voice, Some pliant, pageant thing, who'll wield the sceptre At his high nod. Beware—look to yourselves— I was his friend; but justice, which, with me, Is paramount to friendship, makes me say What now I've said. Com. To tell a truth, my friend, I've often ponder'd Of what you now and formerly have said On this same head; your words have deeply sunk Into my mind. Mont. Why—have you not observed, His every motion, every look, denotes Command? that 'mid your petty strifes and jars, He bends his eye upon you little men, As if he were a god, Rebuking winds and waves into a calm. Com. His every look command! shall it be said That Comyn is commanded By such a man?— I'm satisfied—my part is fixed— Rather I'd bend the knee to England's king, Than make the slightest 'beisance To such a man as Wallace. This upstart warrior, whose forefathers plow'd Their narrow fields, no longer shall usurp The place of those, who, by their noble birth, And rich, widestretch'd domains, have right to rule. To-morrow's rising sun shall see my men March gladly tow'rds the hills of Badenoch. Mont. Not so, my lord;—your resolution Is most wise, but all too rapid. Let what's intended to be done, be done In such a manner, that it may effect The wish'd for consequence. Do not, my lord, draw off your men so soon; Wait till the very sounding of the charge, Wait till the first flight of the English shafts, And then draw off;—so shall you leave exposed Your trusting enemy to be surrounded— He'll flounce and flounder in the English mesh, But ne'er escape.—Meantime, I'll notice send, Of what we purpose, to the English king: I have a trusty man whom oft before I've, unsuspected, sent on secret errands.— No fear, but that for you and for myself I shall with Edward treat upon such terms As cannot fail to please us both. Return you to your men— Your absence may be marked— Com. I go—but hark—come back to me at sunrise. Mont. I will not fail.— [Exit Comyn. O what a perjured recreant am I! A breaker of each sacred bond! A liar—traitor—murderer! I hate myself—but more I'd hate to see The maid of Hexeldham to Wallace given— That thought I cannot bear—I'd look on them, As erst in Paradise the arch-fiend gazed, In speechless envy, on the blessed pair, Then turn'd his scowling eyes aside, And thought of hell.— All sovereign love! thou leadest in thy train All other passions, a strange mingled troop, Hope, fear, hate, pity, jealousy, revenge; Thou cause of every virtue, every vice, That, like the sun, open'st the lovely flower, But with the self-same beams uncoil'st The poisonous snake that lurks beneath! Why did I ever quit, misled by thee, Fair virtue's even path! But now there's no return.— What did I quit it for?—a beauteous woman: And what the price I pay for this same pearl? The blood of thousands of my countrymen,— The widow's tears when weeping o'er the child, That simply asks when will its sire return,— The grief of aged folks who inly curse Their length of days,— The deep, deep hidden woe of broken hearts That mourn for lovers bedded in their blood.— And, say that I should gain this prize, What then will be its worth?—she must, must hate me.— Ev'n, if she were my wedded wife, She would perforce abhor me, And when I'd have her smile—she'd think of Wallace, And answer me with tears. And yet, perhaps, she ne'er may come to know That I contrived the death of her loved lord. Loved!— Wallace shall die—his Margaret shall be mine. For her, all crimes are virtues— Beholding her, my vision is so dazzled I scarcely see ought else but her— She, like the gaz'd on sun, still intervenes Where'er I look, changing the inky cloke Of deepest guilt to brightest heavenly hue— She must, she shall be mine—Wallace must die. [Exit. SCENE IV. —An outpost of the Scotish Camp— Guard changing and giving the word. Robert and Walter, two sentinels, remain. Walt. The dew falls thick—'twill rust our pikes. Rob. To-morrow we shall oil them well with English blood. Walt. I fear more Scotch than English blood will flow; For when there's discord 'mong the leaders, The men must pay for it:— Last night I overheard some bickerings Among the chiefs. Rob. Some bickerings! What did they say?— Walt. I'll tell thee all. When we had done with pitching of the tents, I strayed some bowshots from the camp; the sun Was almost down, and sweet the lighting lark Warbled his evening chaunt: I wander'd to a broomy know, And laid me down among the bushes; I thought of home, and wish'd me there at even Folding our little flock.—I fell asleep, And dreamed I was at home closing the bught— When suddenly my false and happy dream Was broken off by loud and angry words. The voices soon I knew—but dared not move, Lest they should think that I had come to listen. Wallace, Stewart, Comyn, loudest spoke: Sir John De Graham spoke mildly to them all. At last, by his advice, it was agreed That all the host should be divided Into three separate battles; and that each Should be commanded by a different leader. 'Tis this disjointed order that I dread. Rob. But why did Wallace e'er agree To strip himself of the supreme command, Committed to him by the common voice Of all true-hearted Scots? Walt. He feared that Comyn would withdraw his clans: He cares not for his own peculiar power, Unless to use it for his country's good. Rob. Ay, he is made of yielding—he is too humble. Walt. He's gentle as he's brave, and has been so E'en from his boyish days; for I remember, When he and I, light-hearted play-mates, roamed Among the woody banks and braes of Ayr, He ever spared the linnet's nest, But boldly clamb the beetling cliffs, to rob The falcon's aerie;—nor minded he her wings Or pouncing beak, but seized the clamorous prize. Rob. What—what is that—another, from the trees? It cannot be an enemy, we're sure, On this side of the camp. Walt. It seems a lady with a little page. They come this way;—she's like the moon, Attended by that tiny twinkling star— What can this mean? Enter Eleanor, and Page. Stop—who comes? El. A friend. Walt. The word? El. Alas, I know not warlike usages: I am a woman who could not, if she would, Do harm to you—I seek Sir John de Graham— Go, as ye love the cause in which ye fight, Go tell him, that the owner of this ring Will wait for him among yon nearest trees, To say once more farewell. Walt. We may not both, fair lady, go beyond The verge of this our watch, which reaches No farther than yon hawthorn bush. Rob. I'll go— I'm sure I've heard your voice, and think should know Your face, but for that veil. I'm sure you are a friend— I'll bear your ring and message to De Graham. Walt. Meantime, lest that your presence cause alarm, Hie to the spot—he'll soon, I guess, be here. El. I will— [Exit with Page. Rob. Walter, you'd better stand just at the limit—(pointing out. I'll soon be back. Walt. Be sure— [Exeunt separately. SCENE V. —A Wood. Enter Eleanor, and Page. El. Go, boy, go to the brook and gather pebbles, Till I come to thee—I wish to be alone. [Exit Page. He'll sure be here—But what if from the camp He be gone forth upon some sudden service— Perhaps to meet his death?—O cruel Edward! Remorseless murderous tyrant! Ah! does thy callous soul ne'er think? Is it too, like thy body, cased in steel, Impenetrable to the sharpest curses Of dying men when thinking of their children? Dost thou not think how many, by the death Of but one man, are ever reft of peace?— Besides the dearest relatives by blood, How oft some plighted heart like mine must mourn— Mourn! no; my heart was never made to mourn. If thou shouldst fall, for whom alone I live, My heart would cease to beat.—Why comes he not?— I hear a rustling there—'tis but the breeze— I see the gleam of steel—my heart misgives me— It mayn't be he—'Tis he! De Grah. My Eleanor!— El. De Graham—how could you say That there would be no battle for some while, And that you would return, Once more to bid adieu!—You have deceived me. De Grah. Eleanor—why, dearest, hast thou come Thus to unhinge my soul?—thy words, thy presence Will make a coward of me. To part with life, 'tis nothing—but to leave My Eleanor!—that thought is death indeed. I could not bring myself to say A last farewell,—but fain would have deceived Myself, as well as you, by counterfeited hopes Of meeting soon again. El. But if we ne'er should meet again!— My soul is filled with dark forebodings. I think I see you dead—or lying wounded, And none to help. O that I could be there To place my arm beneath your sinking head— To drink the last look of your closing eye.— But say, swear to me now upon the rood, That if you fall, you'll send to me Some dying token of your love; If 'twere no more but some endearing word. O let your last word be my name, And make some faithful soldier bear it me;— And tell him mark the turf 'neath which you're laid, That I may come and die upon it. De Grah. My Eleanor, fear not, I shall not die: I'll live for Liberty, and for thy sake. In that great cause I am all soul; My spirit overflows, And will, as 'twere, impart a portion Of its own high invulnerable essence To this corporeal frame. In freedom's cause I'm all on fire, and one might hope as well To wound the ever-closing flame,—as me. I will not fall. I'll live for Scotland, and for thee. But tell me, Eleanor, how hast thou come? Where is the page the soldier told me of? El. My page— He's playing, thoughtless wight! beside the brook. De Grah. Is he thy sole attendant? How wilt thou in the dead of night return? How reach again thy father's towers in safety? El. As for my safety,—waste not a thought upon it; The boy knows every glade and dingle here So well, that, in two hours, or little more, He will conduct me to my father's gate; And by a path so little known, That, even in this boisterous time of war, I'm sure to meet with no annoyance. Hither we came, nor heard aught to alarm us, Save now and then the rustling of the trees. My safety! never think of it. Think of your own. I dread the confidence Which you express, will make you risque too much. Put trust in God alone,—not in yourself, Or in the cause in which you fight, However just. De Grah. In God I trust, and in your holy prayers. El. Next to your safety, nearest to my heart Is one who fights upon the other side: He is my brother, and he but obeys The pleasure of our aged father, Who has sworn (basely I own) Fealty to Edward, and has sent his son To join the English host.—Small aid can he Give any side: he is full two years younger Than is your Eleanor. Think of his youth, And if you chance to meet him in the field, For my sake spare him: You'll know him by a scarf of green Which I did work for him; And which, e'er since I gave it him, he wears On his sword arm: he thinks it has a charm To give his pithless nerves the force of manhood. De Grah. Fear not, my life, for him or me. I'll give my men in charge to spare the youth. I trust that we shall meet—I'll bring him captive To your father, and get you as the ransom Of his son. El. How shall I know, the battle o'er, That you yourself are safe? The swiftest horse is but a creeping snail When fraught with joyful tidings. De Grah. The trump of victory will first proclaim The joyful tidings, that your Graham is safe— For he is safe, if but the battle's won: To-morrow night, long ere this hour, You'll see the flame triumphant From Stirling's highest tower ascend, And quite outshine the moon.— But now, alas! we must, must part; My duty calls me from my Eleanor. El. Must part! ah, me! why might not separate souls One body animate, And then they'd never part? De Grah. Farewell, my life. El. O stay—nay go—farewell— Take me to the boy— De Grah. Where shall we find him? El. Yonder, beside the brook. [Exit, leaning on De Graham.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —English Camp between Linlithgow and Falkirk—Edward's Tent. Edward sitting, attended by the Bishop of Durham, Earl Marishall, Aymer De Valence, Sir Giles D'Argentine, and Sir Ralph Basset. Ed. I trust, my lords, I have expressed myself In such plain language, that in to-morrow's field, Ev'n in the very hurricane of the fight, Ye in your separate commands will act As if one spirit rul'd each word and deed. Dur. Your highness' words (as I have always found) Have in this present instance been so clear, That I do think I see, as pictur'd forth, The whole array and order of the march— Th' assault, the fight, and the discomfiture Confused of the rebellious Scots: I see The head of that arch-rebel, Wallace, Borne, streaming still adown the blessed lance That's doom'd to pierce his traitorous side. D'Argent. Think you, Lord Bishop, that your words Will be prophetic of to-morrow's deeds? Dur. I did not change the crosier for the sword For nought. What in me lies, that will I do, To put rebellion down. Ours is the cause Of God and man: yet others of our order, Sunk in the lap of sloth, think it unmeet In me to mingle in these bloody broils; And say, I wear the helm, in hopes to gain The mitre falling from the aged head Of England's primate. This, my liege well knows, Is envy's breath, which strives to blight my deeds, And rob me of the harvest, which his bounty Might, in due season, gratefully bestow, Rather upon my long tried service, than my wish. I prize not worldly honours. Ed. No, no—you prize not worldly honours. Durh. But now, the order of the sight being plann'd, Were it not meet (since mercy should precede The steps of justice) to dispatch forthwith Your grace's heralds to the rebel camp, With boons of pardon to the penitent, And threats of punishment upon the heads Of those who court their doom? I'll pawn my soul, That, at our trumpet's sound, the quailing hearts Of thousands of the common rebel rout Will leap for joy, and hail the herald's voice, With Long live Edward! Among them all, There's scarce as much of noble generous blood As soil a sword withal: No, there's scarce one, Of all the motley crew, above the rank Of self-created knight—all younger sons Of younger brothers' bastards—outlaws— Deer-stealers—unshaven monks who've broke their vows.— Ev'n nuns have overleapt their convent walls, And for their vails iron visors have put on— Debtors, whose prison gates rebellion broke— Thieves rescued from the gallows foot—beggars Who've laid aside their counterfeited lameness.— Such is the Scotish host, a starving crew Of landless knaves, with nought but life to lose, Who, at the name of Wallace and of Freedom, (As if there were a spell in that curst word) Have swarmed around the standard of rebellion.— But that strange spell, if I can guess aright, Will be dissolved when pardon is proclaimed. Materials so discordant, must, if touched, Crumble: the trumpet, sounding peace and life, With mere concussion of the air, will make The bubble burst. Ed. Your counsel, Bishop, is most wise: 'Tis politic, as it is merciful.— Take order, then, Earl Marishall, That at the break of day, Rougecroix and his pursuivants repair With due attendance to the Scotish camp. Charge him, that he announce mercy to all Who turn repentant from the guilty path Of treason,—mercy to all, save Wallace That prince of traitors, and his friend De Graham, Stewart, and Comyn, and the Priest of Glasgow; Likewise the maid of Hexeldham, Who followed Wallace from the banks of Tyne, And now in man's attire arms 'gainst her country: And let there be proclaimed, not only life, But high rewards, if they will render up The forenamed recreant leaders of their gang. Durh. Perhaps, my liege, 'twere not far wrong to add What fate the obdurate citizens of Berwick Drew on themselves, their wives, and little ones, By their resistance to your highness' right,— How that the embers of that trait'rous town Still hiss, as falls from time to time the beam Half burnt among the damm'd up blood,— And that, unless submission be the word, Such fate awaits fair Stirling's stately towers. Ed. Well said, good father— Earl Marishall, do what's right. Mean time, an hour of rest (sleep who can hope At such a time!) will much bestead— Then to your tents, my Lords—Farewell till sunrise. [Exeunt, Edward accompanying them out of the tent. SCENE II. —Outpost of English Camp. Two Sentinels on guard. 1. Sent. 'Tis plaguy cold—I wish our watch was o'er. 2. Sent. 'Twill not be long—The moon is almost set—and see yon reddening streak in the east.—The day will come soon enough at will—I wish it was but done.—Some of us will never see another sunrise— 1. Sent. Ay, many a man must fall—'tis Edward's will.— 2. Sent. I wish I were again upon the banks of winding Were. 1. Sent. How did you come to be a soldier? 2. Sent. Our warlike Bishop caused each tenant in his land send out one son at least. 1. Sent. I think I hear some voices yonder, near the rock—Let us go see. 2. Sent. We must not pass the stream. 1. Sent. We'll go to it. [Exeunt. SCENE III. —Scotish Camp. Enter Wallace, Stewart, De Graham, Wishart, Frazer, De Bois, Margaret. Wall. What can detain the Lord of Badenoch? Stew. He'll sure be here ere long. Enter Soldier. Sold. My Lord, the English heralds are approaching. [Flourish heard. Wall. Well, let them come—Hark, their trumpets bray. Enter Rougecroix and Pursuivants. Welcome, Rougecroix—What message from your King? Rouge. Wallace, and you the other leaders of the Scots, I come, by order of the King of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Bretagne, With offers of free pardon to your followers, Provided they desist from this rebellion, And render up their arms.—My Sovereign's mercy Is pledged to all who quit the guilty path Of treason; mercy to all, save you, Wallace, and your friend De Graham, Stewart and Comyn, Frazer and the Priest Of Glasgow, and the maid of Hexeldham; To whom, all and each one, the sword of justice Will render speedily the due reward Of guilt.—Further, I do demand permission And safe-conduct while I pass, proclaiming To his rebellious, but misguided subjects, The purpose of his grace's clemency. Wall. My friends, what say you to this gracious boon— Ought we to drink this cup of sweet and bitter?— What answer should be made? Com. Say, that we'll make our answer when we plant The Scotish thistle in the English soil. Stew. Our swords will ring our answer 'bout his ears. De Grah. Say, that we'll write our answer on the turf, In characters of English blood— Say, we disdain his mercy, and despise His threats. Wall. You hear, Rougecroix, the mind of some of us. But, lest your King should think that 'tis despair Which urges us, from whom all hope of mercy Is cut off, to answer with defiances, We now permit you to pass thro' the camp, To blow your trumpets, and to burst your lungs With bellowing chains and pardon to the Scots. Not only this permission shall ye have, But likewise free safe-conduct for all those Who choose to bend the knee, and lay their necks Below the monarch's foot.—Go, then, and try— We'll be obliged to you—Your trumpets' blast Will sift the worthless chaff from 'mong the grain. But much I doubt if any now will trust (Tho' willing to accept the proffer'd grace) The royal word of your deep-perjur'd Lord.— To him Wallace returns no answer— His princely state, with all the pageantry Of royalty, can never draw from me A feigning answer, couched in courteous phrase; And with an answer of a different sort, Which best would suit the merits of your master, I would not choose to soil my lips.—But go, Try what effect your prince's clemency Will have upon our poor and ragged men. Rouge. I doubt not but that some will be convinced Of th' error of their ways, and wish to expiate This most unjust and unprovoked rebellion, By serving with their utmost power the King, Whom hitherto they have resisted In most unlawful and ungodly wise. Wall. You had as well reserve your eloquence For those you mean to address.—My friend, (to De Grah. Be pleased to attend Rougecroix thro' the camp, And see no violence, to him, or to his suite, Be offered by the over-zealous warmth Of those who think that mercy is a gift Fit for a slave's acceptance, while to the free It is but insult— [Exeunt De Graham, Rougecroix, and Pursuivants—Flourish. Wall. We'll to our several posts; For some intention to surprise our camp May lurk beneath this shew of mercy: We've more to dread from the craft and treachery, Than from the valour of the king. [Exeunt. Re-enter Rougecroix and Pursuivants— De Graham following. Rouge. No, I will not proceed one other foot To be insulted thus, and, in my person, Th' august and royal Majesty of England— To be so jeered, so scoff'd, so taunted at By barbarous and half-starved Highlanders, Who rudely answered to our trumpets' sound With such a scream of discord from their pipes, As would have scared the devil back to hell— De Grah. Be calm—be pacified! Rouge. And then these Lowlanders, with bugle horns, Raised such a din, as almost rent the welkin— This is not to be borne.—I do require Forthwith to be conducted to the verge Of this detested camp, the abode of treason, Insolence, pride, poverty, and rags. But know—my Sovereign and his knights Will soon be here, To give due chastisement to all his foes. De Grah. You're welcome to depart; For sure you were sent here to bear a message, Not to rail:— I wish your feet were nimble as your tongue. This is your way. [Exit De Graham, conducting Rougecroix, &amp;c. SCENE IV. —A Field—Alarums— Enter Wallace, Frazer, and Soldiers. Wall. To arms!—'tis as I said—To arms!— They're close upon us—there, o'er the brushwood, Their banners move—see!— Strike hard, my countrymen! strike hard and home! Plant close your spears à frise! mark for the rivets— Let no man's point return this day unstained— Move like a bulging wave, unbroken, close, Silent, until ye dash upon the Southrons! [Exeunt. SCENE V. —Another part of the Field. Enter De Graham retreating, followed by Valence de St Clair, De Bois, and Scotish Soldiers around. De Grah. Touch him not—Leave him to me— I'll soon disarm him.— Take care, rash youth. I fain would spare thee. 'Twas never seen before, that I retired Before the face of man.—'Tis not for thee— 'Tis for another, that I yield my ground. De St Clair. Surrender, knight, or my impatient sword Will leap into thy breast. [Exit De Graham retiring, followed by De St Clair. De Bois. He falls—he falls, slain by a boy! What can this mean?—the bravest of the brave Laid low by such an arm!—If I can find The beardless popinjay, I will not wait Till he shall strike—Revenge! [Exit. SCENE VI. —A Heath. Enter Wallace, supported by Frazer and Walter. Wall. We're far enough— 'Tis but a scratch—and soon I shall be well; I'm only faint from loss of blood.— Walter, haste back—tell I am well again, And that I'm gone to another part of the line— And say the march of Comyn's men is but a feint, To draw the English into an ambuscade— Rush to the front—speak loud, And lay about you well— Walt. Trust me. Wall. Go, Frazer, you, and fetch me word How goes the battle, and where our archers And the maid of Hexham fight— Find them, and order that they now retreat Behind the line. Fraz. How can I leave you thus? Wall. I command—I am not ill—Go— [Exit Frazer. Comyn and all his men withdrawn! Stewart almost cut off, betray'd by Comyn! O treachery! like the sudden lightning's flash, Unseen until the instant when it strikes, Thou hast, in time of greatest need, Quite shrivell'd up one arm of Scotland. Comyn! I thought thou wert a fierce, hot-blooded man, But till this day I thought thee honest— Enter Frazer. Speak—tell me, Frazer! Fraz. Worse still, and worse—Stewart is slain— His men give way—the English archery Have galled them sore:—full many a dying hand Holds in its struggling grasp the useless lance:— Our archers have retired, and glad were they To hear the order, all but the maid of Hexham— She scarcely could be forced to quit the ground. Wall. She's safe? Fraz. She was so when I left her. Enter De Bois. De Bois. Sir John De Graham is slain—I held his hand When he gave up his breath—I have brought low The youth that slew him—His men still fight More furiously, since e'er they saw him fall: But 'twill not do—the battle's lost. [Exit. Wall. De Graham!—my friend! my brother! Would I had died for thee!— But there's a time for grief— Revenge—revenge is now the word!— Thy death shall cost the English dear— Help me to rise—I will avenge thy death. (rises. My sword!—Alas, this will not do— Curse on this arm—it will not move— Thou too dost cheat me in my time of need. O hateful life! thus to be half alive, Unable to avenge the deadliest death That e'er was knell'd into mine ear! Fraz. For love of God, and of your country, Think not of vengeance, noble Wallace, now. I do entreat you to reserve yourself, And the remainder of the Scotish power, Until some day to Scotland more propitious. This is the line which duty doth point out— Sound the retreat—mount—your horse is standing near. Wall. I yield, brave Frazer; for full sure I am Thou would'st not give thy counsel for retreat, But at the call of peremptory duty— Do you then give the order—Call Monteith. Monteith and you shall lead the forces off— You'll rendezvous on t'other side of Carron, Three bowshots 'mong the woods. Fraz. Monteith was taken, early in the day, By Roger Bohun, an English squire. Wall. Far better he had fallen in the field; For much I fear that England's ruthless king Will find out some pretext why brave Monteith Should be excluded from a prisoner's rights, And treated as a subject ta'en in arms Against his prince. Fraz. Think, Wallace, of yourself; less of your friends— Haste, mount—our men give ground. Wall. It must be so—curse on this powerless arm! [Exeunt. SCENE VII. —A Wood near a Castle. Enter Eleanor. El. O that this day were done!—and yet I dread Its close; for it may bring to me sad tidings. Perhaps his death-wound will be dealt 'Tween this and sunset.— O dismal, dreadful day! Tho' bright and almost cloudless be thy sky, To me there's nought but gloom. That bird's sweet strain—it has no melody— The murmur of that stream has nothing soothing— These lovely flowers for me have no perfume.— O that my days of childhood would return, When, pleased, I chased the butterfly or bee: Then did I hear of wars and bloody fields, Nor asked with trembling lip the names of those Who fell, nor cared who won: Ten thousand deaths Gave me no grief, if but my linnet lived. Time, never to return!—My days must now Be marked with still encreasing woes. But wherefore so ingenious to forebode Misfortune?—He will perhaps—he will Return—This night again I'll hear his step Among these shades—He'll clasp me in his arms, Ere yet I'm sure 'tis he—His hilt-worn hand Will mine engrasp with most delightful pain, And he will tell me, as when he returned From Cambuskenneth field, the valiant deeds Performed by Wallace, Stewart, Frazer, Bois— Nor once speak of himself—unless to tell, If I should start to see his purpled hand, That 'tis from English veins—He will return.— O sun, how bright thou now dost shine! Sweet birds, what melody is in your notes! Ye streams, how softly soothing is your flow! Ye flowers, how prettily ye droop, breathing Your fragrance— Dear images of peace!—Abhorred war, How canst thou here intrude!—Alas, thy trump, Tho' distant far, echoes from hill to hill, Wafted on fancy's breath.—I hear thy clang, I see the thousand swords gleam at thy word— I see the man for whom alone I bear To live—I see him wounded, on the field— And thousands passing, heedless of his state, Intent alone on saving of themselves.— A step—a hasty tread—Can it be he? Enter Soldier running. Stop, stop—whence art thou? Sold. I'm from a bloody field—am I safe here? El. Thou art—but tell me quick, all that thou know'st— Where is Sir John De Graham? Sold. I saw him fighting in the hottest brunt, But with ill luck—The day is Edward's— Thro' treachery 'tis his!— El. O heavy news!—But didst thou hear or see No more of him—De Graham? Sold. I heard that he had slain young De St Clair— El. My brother! sweet Valence—cruel De Graham— I must—I ought to hate thee.—Ought! poor word— Thou hast no power—I must, must love him still— Yea, though 'twere my own breast that he had pierced, Its last, its dying throb, would still be his.— But stop, soldier—tell me— Sold. I cannot—they're coming—I hear a trampling. El. 'Tis but the deer brushing thro' yonder thicket— Here thou art safe—thou'rt far from Falkirk field. Tell me again whate'er— Sold, Hark!—I must—I must away. [Exit. El. It yet may not be so—he only heard That Valence had been slain. Enter another Soldier. Stop—stop—I do beseech thee— Say quickly all thou know'st— Is De St Clair slain by Sir John De Graham? And is De Graham himself in safety? Sold. Lady, am I in safety here? El. Yes—safe—else how should I be here?—But speak— Answer! Sold. It was, in sooth, a bloody, bloody day; And Wallace was borne off the field, His right arm dangling at his side, sore wounded— And brave Monteith, his friend, is ta'en; and all This ill has happ'd thro' Comyn's treachery, Whose sword is clean this day from English blood— He at the first led off his men.— El. But what know'st of De Graham? Sold. Some say that he lies low, slain by a youth, A little braggard boy—St Clair by name. El. It is not true—thou liest!—confess thou liest; De Graham!—no, no—he was not slain by Valence— Valence was slain by him—Say that thou err'st. Sold. I hear a trumpet sound—I must be gone. El. 'Tis but some shepherd's boy blowing his horn— Say, is it false that thou hast said?— Leave me not thus!—stop!— Sold. I cannot stop—I must—Hear!—I must away. [Exit. El. Most cruel coward!—most false and lying caitiff! The first was right—and my poor brother's dead.— It must be so—This fellow lies: He had a stupid vacant stare; a face Just fitted to mistake a yes—for no.— He must be wrong—he thought a sheep-boy's horn A warlike trump—so may he have mista'en St Clair for Graham—And yet, how could that be?— Another soldier!—but his pace more slow— He is no coward—or, if at all afraid, It is of me. Come forward, friend—fear not. Enter De Bois. De Bois! 'tis you—O tell me all!—Alas, I see it all—I see a fatal tale Lurk in your eye—Speak! De Bois. I come from him who was Sir John De Graham. El. Was! most cruel, meaning word! He's slain—he's gone—thy silence speaks. De Bois. You've guess'd aright.— I'm come the bearer of the latest word Which fell from John De Graham. El. De Bois, help me—lend me thy arm— I feel much better—yes; I'm well. I can bear any thing. I feel as 'twere a hardness at my heart.— Now tell me all the manner of his death. De Bois. Why should I tell you more than I have told?— He died, and, dying, sent his blessing to you— And, with it, dying tokens of his love, Which I have hither brought for you—that's all— Why should I add to your distress?— El. I do conjure thee by a woman's grief, A woman's widow'd grief, to tell me all. Tell me his every word, each look, each sigh. Why give me but a portion of the truth, Like to some half-veil'd picture Of some dread, nameless deed, which fancy paints More horrid than the truth?—Tell me the whole: I am prepared.—I have so oft beheld, In all my dreams, De Graham lie bleeding, Trying in vain to speak, to speak to me; Or, sinking, struggling 'mid the stormy billows; Or led to die beneath the murderous axe, While cruel Edward gluts his thirsty eyes:— With these, and such like dreadful phantasies, I've been so used, that the reality Can never daunt me. Wherefore, I do entreat That you would faithfully rehearse The manner of his death, nor falsely miss One circumstance ye know. With stedfast eye I'll look; nor shed a tear—I cannot weep— Say on, if you have pity for my sorrow. De Bois. I see determination on your brow; Therefore, this tongue shall nought omit, Of what my eyes beheld, or ears have heard, Concerning the last moments of the man Who should have been your lord.— In the beginning of the fight, he had received A wound; but still he fought. At last he fell, Pierced by your brother's sword. He prized too dear The young man's life—he risked himself to spare it— And in the endeavour sacrificed his own. El. And I have murdered him, to save a brother!— O hateful, hated brother! De Bois. That brother did I kill: for when I saw De Graham brought low by such an arm, I forward press'd, and cut De St Clair down. The rest of Sir John's followers, soon as they learned That he was down—frantic they onward flew, Like a redoubled storm after a pause, And made such havock 'mong the English ranks, That soon our part of the field was almost cleared. De Graham lay far behind, waving his hand: I thought he beckoned me, and I returned. His face was pale, yet fire was in his eye. The blood was welling from his armour chinks. He asked for water, and a soldier ran To a small rill that play'd hard by, and fetch'd A helmet-full; but it was purple-ting'd, And at the sight Sir John did thrust it from him. He then looked up to heaven, and cried, O Christ, Forgive me all the blood that I have shed; 'Twas for my country's sake. And then he made me doff his steel-scaled glove, And draw this ring from off his finger; And next he said, De Bois, unclasp my breastplate: Which being done, he took from near his heart This ivory cross, all bloody as it was, And, having kissed it and the ring, Gave them to me, and said, while tear by tear Coursed down his cheek, Carry these mournful gifts To Eleanor St Clair; Tell her, I die thinking of heaven and her; And then he said, My Eleanor! And once again he half-pronounced your name, But gave a gasp, and died. El. Most blessed, blood-stained cross!—it is his blood.— De Graham—'twill not be long—I will not live— No, tho' the God of heaven should curse me With a thousand lives, I'd find some means To rid me of them all.—Fear not, my friend; I'm calm—I shed no tears—I look upon my fate, And smile on misery.—But is he dead?— Thou didst mistake—'twas Wallace thou saw'st die— And can this be another wretched dream? And shall I wake, and shudder, 'mid my joy To find it false?—Ah no! I do not dream;— Each tree, each shrub, each flower is in its place; I hear the stream, I hear the wild bird's song; That is the wood lark, that the ring-dove's wail; This crucifix I feel is of material stuff; It is no vision of the mind: That is no fancied stain—'tis his heart's blood—(falls in a swoon. De Bois. She revives—Look up again, dear lady. Be comforted—you yet have many friends. Your father lives— El. Comfort! Most barbarous man, thou tear'st my very heart; Thou triest to heal a mortal wound, torturing The dying wretch. De Bois. Sweet lady, I beseech your pardon; I meant not to offend; I will be silent; And, if you will, I'll answer tear for tear, And sigh for sigh: for I, too, loved De Graham— I was his friend. El. I am myself again. I give you thanks For all you've said, for all you've done for me. My mind is now serene—I think of heaven. One only duty have I to discharge, And then I'll die—with joy. I must behold due obsequies performed To my loved lord, And then I'll stretch myself upon his grave, And weep myself to death. I'll beg his body of the English King. Tell me how I may have access. De Bois. I heard he purposed this night to sleep In Stirling town. El. Thither I'll go; the evening fast draws on. I feel an energy pervade my soul, That makes me equal to attempt some things, Of which, the mere imagination, Would once have palsied every nerve with awe: I'll dare the tyrant's scowl; I'll brave the unfeeling looks of staring courtiers; I'll plead, I'll supplicate, I'll weep, I'll threat; The tyrant's frown, his furious eye I'll meet, Nor lower mine.—I could outstare the sun! Methinks I could into the presence rush Of the great God himself, And thence demand the parted spirit back— O Christ, forgive a woman's frenzied grief! De Bois. Stop, lady— El. I must—I will to the English quarters. De Bois. You cannot go—you do not know the word. Watch after watch is stationed all around The English quarters. You cannot force your way—they'll make you turn. El. Spite of my grief, I'll smile so meekly on them, They'll fear no harm from me, but let me pass. Or, if they should refuse, I'll run upon their points, And so obtain my wish—death. [Exit. De Bois. Most wretched woman! Bitter, sure, thy woes, Which so bedim thine eye, it cannot see A brother's death! She thinks not of her Valence, Nor does she curse my hand which shed his blood. [Exit. END OF ACT SECOND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —A Wood on the Western Banks of Carron. Enter Wallace, Frazer, and Soldiers. Wall. How many do ye muster? Fra. Scarcely five hundred. Wall. Ah! piteous gleanings of a plenteous field.— It will not do—why should I sacrifice These hapless men in rash and vain attempts In my own cause? for hers, I feel, is mine. But are ye sure, my friends, that they are ta'en? Fra. I saw the Bishop render up himself To Earl Marishall; and the maid of Hexham, At the same instant, was disarmed, And taken by Sir Ralph Basset.— They were retreating at the time.— To attempt to rescue them with our small force, Were madness. Wall. A curse upon this wounded, powerless arm! Fra. Be patient—in few weeks 'twill wield again Th' avenging sword of Scotland.—In the mean time, Fear not that any harm befal the prisoners. To put to death the beauteous maid of Hexham, Upon the poor pretext that she was ta'en In arms against her rightful Sovereign, Would be a deed of such foul infamy, That even Edward will not venture it. As to our conduct in the present exigence, I would advise, that now our men disperse; And that we, with a chosen few, Betake us to a forest life. Let us wage war upon the fallow deer, Until the time, when, with some hope of fortune, We may take aim at England's king. Wall. I'm satisfied: Frazer, your counsel's wise. I long have seen, and you yourself have seen, The secret envy working in the hearts Of those, who, on the score of birth and lands, Think they alone are worthy of the trust Reposed in me by Scotland's commoners. From this day, then, I quit the name and power Of Regent. It shall no more be said, That I'm the cause of discord. I trust, that, in my stead, there will be found Some man who, in his single self, unites Nobility and numerous vassallage, Far-stretched domains, wisdom and courage, Honour, and every other quality, Most requisite at such a time as this. For me, whoever leads, Wallace will follow. Soon as I see our powers again arrayed Against the southern robbers of our freedom, I'll be the humblest soldier in the field; I'll change these arms; nor shall it e'er be known Where Wallace fights, save by the yielding lanes Which he will cut among the English bands.— Now, let us for the present think of safety. Are all the fords and passes rightly watched? We should preserve a show of greater power Than we possess: The rising moon's faint rays Will favour the deceit; and when she gains Her midnight height, we'll without noise decamp, And, having gained the Lenzie woods, disperse. But while we here remain, we ought to light As many fires as— Enter Soldier. Sold. My lord, there is a herald on the bank That's opposite the over-jutting rock. He comes with Robert De Bruce, and, in his name, Entreats a parley. Wall. Tell, I will be with him. [Exit Soldier. Frazer, you'll follow me with fifty men; You'll wait some forty spear-lengths from the rock. Fra. I will. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —Bank of Carron. Enter Wallace and Robert De Bruce, on opposite sides. De Bru. Wallace, I'm hither come with friendly purpose. I do admire, as all the English do, The wit and valour which you have displayed; Pity in such a desperate cause as yours.— A king, the most puissant of the age, 'Gainst this poor corner cannot but prevail. But, say that in the contest you succeed, The haughty nobles ne'er would brook t' obey A governour of such obscure estate As you. Be then advised;—sail with the stream. Wall. How you do misconceive!—Ambition! This breast was never haunted by that fiend. My country's freedom, not the paltry power Of governing my countrymen—was what I sought; And were it not for you, and other Scots Who aid the English king, The issue of this war would not be doubtful. From traitors and from hollow-hearted friends Arise the dangers to the public cause. This little nook is filled with manly minds, Who, were they not betrayed by slavish lords Fearful to lose their land, would bid defiance To all the proud and overgrown beaf-eaters Between the Tweed and Thames.—You, and such like, To you must be ascribed the ravaged towns, The burning cottages, the pools of blood That reek from Falkirk field:—Look to that moon In heaven, how pale;—look down on Carron's stream, How deep, deep ting'd her image there appears. De Bru. Your keen reproaches I can bear.— When disappointment rankles at the breast, The tongue may be allowed some license.— But listen, if you can, to reason's voice. If Scotland would submit, she'd be indulg'd With every privilege that is possessed By Edward's southern subjects.—Why then resist? Wall. O strange delusion! fatal to both kingdoms!— Full well we know King Edward's deep-laid craft, First to enslave us Scots, and then to turn His added power against fair England's laws. Shortsighted, foolish Englishmen! ye forge Chains for yourselves, by conquering this land. Conquest! no, that shall never, never be. Our swords may for a time sleep in their scabbards: They'll rouse again: We only want a little breathing time.— For me—I'll rather die, than meanly breathe The air at Edward's will.—Farewell—Return to him, And lick his hand, gloved in your brethrens gore: Study the tyrant's words, his nods, his looks; And, when he slips the leash, fly at your countrymen, Fly, and tear their bowels out. [Exit. De Bru. O what a base, a dastard wretch am I! [Exit. SCENE III. —A Room of State in Stirling Castle. Enter Edward and Earl Marishall. Time—night. Ed. But are you sure that Wallace has escaped? Mar. From diligent inquiry, I have learnt That Wallace galloped, wounded, off the field, Mounted on a fleet barb, and that our horse Were far outdistanced in the chase.— Ed. Send in Monteith—we've yet some use for him. Mar. I go. [Exit. Ed. With this Monteith, this prince of miscreants, I must for some time yet preserve a show Of kindness. Enter Earl Marishall and Monteith. Sir John Monteith, our work is incomplete; Your friend was better mounted than we thought. You know, for what ye've done, ye shall receive Three manours on the Thames, The lands of Ellerslie, and four score marks, And with these gifts the maid of Hexeldham, Whom, for your sake, I pardon of her treason. But, while that base arch-traitor Wallace lives, I cannot deem my new dominions safe. Now, could you not devise some way, by which, Under the semblance of your former friendship, You might ensnare him? An earldom, with seven manours more, Shall be the price of this great service:— But, in the execution of this plan, I fear the rumours of your service past, Performed to me, may put him on his guard. Mont. Fear not for that, my Lord.— He is so foolishly hard to believe Aught that is uttered to the prejudice Of any of his friends, that, what of ill Is said of me, he will nor listen to, Unless supported by more proof than rumour. But, to ensure success, 'twill be most fit That still you treat me as your prisoner: I, when it suits, shall feign to have escaped, And hie to Wallace. Well I know his haunts. With six score men I will engage To bring him, quick or dead, before your Grace. Ed. You may retire—you are a prisoner at large. [Exit Monteith. Enter Beck, Sir Ralph Basset Aymer De Valence, and Sir Giles D'Argentine. Beck. God save your Grace—You've rode as Jehu drove— How long is't since your Highness did arrive? And, in God's name, how have you so soon climb'd These rocks and walls? The blazing of the town Told me that it was ta'en: indeed, I could Full three miles off (and once I thought to do't) Have read Te Deum by the light.— But how into the castle have you got? Ed. Treason, that master-key, opened the gates. Sir John Monteith gave us his armour; One of our men did put it on, And, at the head of four score trusty soldiers, Who had put on the arms and tatter'd clothes Which they had stript from off the carcases Of the slain Scots, pretended that they came A remnant from the field, to throw themselves As succours into the garrison.— The bridge was straight let down, and in we rush'd, And here we are. Beck. In sooth we've passed a bustling, joyful day, And, ere we sleep, we must, an' please your Grace, Have something to wash down the dust withal; We'll drink, that such success as we this day Have seen, may ay await rebellion: We'll make a jovial night on't. The town itself makes a most noble bonfire; I thought I scarcely should have got along Without a singe. But for my hazard, I was well repaid With some few merry tricks the soldiers play'd. I saw a house all in a blaze below; A woman with a child shriek'd from above:— What does a fellow, who beheld her plight, But beckon to her to let fall the elf Into his open arms?—She lets it fall— But dext'rously he catch'd it on his pike; And after it— Enter Steward of Household. Steward. An' please your Grace, the tables are all set In the great hall. Beck. Ay, ay, let us begone. Enter Eleanor. El. Most mighty Prince, a lady kneels To beg of you the corpse of John De Graham. But for these wars, I should have been his wife. Ed. Thy suit is fruitless; I have gi'en command T' expose the quarter'd body of De Graham, And of the chiefs who by the sword have 'scaped The axe, above the gateways of this town. El. Oh horrid! horrid!—for mercy's sake, Most powerful Prince, grant this my poor request: My brother died, ranged on your Highness' side. Ed. What then? It is a vassal's duty to resign His life, his all, in fighting for his Lord. El. Have pity!— Beck. Woman, you interrupt unseasonably, now, His Highness's and our refreshment: Begone! Affairs of greater import than the tears Of foolish love-sick damsels call us hence. You need not give yourself and us More trouble 'bout th' interment of your Lord; I dare to say he is already buried Beneath a heap of recreants like himself; And, tho' you had full leave to search for him, You might as well attempt to pick me out Some one particular sheaf from 'mong my tythes, As cull the traitor Graham from 'mong the wreaths Of rebels that lie tedded on the field.— You could not know the man again: For death's a sad disguiser of the visage: By this time, trust me, he has screw'd the smile, With which your lover wont to look on you, Into a ghastly grin;—and, 'stead of eyes That lighten'd love, has stuck two stone-like orbs. Wherefore, fair lady, be advised; hie home; Repine not; mourn not: 'tis a heinous crime, 'Tis rank rebellion against heaven itself, To weep for rebels against heaven's anointed. Go to—Go to— El. Most savage hypocrite! Beck. Come, come, my Lord—the dishes will be cool Before this maniac finish. El. O stay, King Edward! Hear, for an instant, what I have to say. Ed. 'Tis all in vain; I am not to be sway'd. A woman's tears, though pour'd from beauteous eyes, A woman's words, though breathed from angel lips, Shall never, never move the king of England To budge one hairbreadth from the spot on which He rests his firm resolve. The order's given: Your lover's limbs must grace the gateways. El. Proud, cruel Edward! hear, and mark my words. Thy cruelty will damn thy purposes; For tho' thy savage words, like lightning, bear Destruction on their wings, Yet, like the lightning's shock, they may restore The palsied arm of Scotland to its power. What down-chinn'd youth, who hears of thy dire deeds, But will at once start into man! Who, hearing how thou tramplest and insult'st Over a fallen foe—over a suppliant woman, But will at once feel his right arm new-nerv'd! His breast invulnerable!—Death! Who will now think of death! Beck. Listen no more to this wild lunatic; Let's to the hall, my Lord. Ed. Lady, we leave you to yourself, And to your own more calm reflections. Perchance you will think better, And own the justice of my sovereign will, And your injustice in arraigning it. [Exeunt Edward and his train. El. O God, O God, forgive me! I must die; I will not live.—Relentless tyrant! Thou heardst me, like the raging waves. I am resolved—I die—But, what a dreadful height! But what can now to me be dreadful? Can I endure to live?—to live, and know, That those dear arms, which once encircled me, That thy mild eyes— De Graham, I come— My spirit, ere I reach the rugged rock, Will in the midway air be left, and joined To thine. [Exit. SCENE IV. —Hall in the Castle. Time—night. Edward, Beck, Marishall, Basset, De Valence, D'Argentine, &amp;c. seated at a Banquet. Beck. You did most right, my Lord; For what is justice, without firmness? Grant but one suit, and thousands more will buzz About your ears. Grant them the rebel's corse, Next they will beg his lands, and with them buy So many masses, morning, noon, and night, From holy men, As will too soon pray back the trait'rous soul From Purgatory's fires. Wherefore my vote Still is,—to forfeit to the fowls of heaven Each leader's corpse,—his spirit to the devil,— His lands to those whose well-tried zealous service, Performed for your Grace, best merits them. E. Marish. I think, with all due deference to your Lordship, That vengeance after death— Beck. You think, my Lord! you cannot think. Leave thinking to the Church. And you, my Liege, Take down the Scotish arms from off the gates, And blazon other arms—some few bend-dexters Quartering heads and hearts. Enter Yeoman of the Guards. Yeom. The Lady De St Clair has thrown herself from the battlements over the southern rock—I saw her spring from off the edge. Beck. Why, then, she's dead ere now. Yeom. Ay, tho' she had been made of flint. It was a dreadful sight—Between the vault she made, and the dash heard from below, there was a mute unbreathing interval. Beck. 'Tis plain self-slaughter, and it well deserves The heaviest penalty the law inflicts,— Which is, denial of all holy rites, And that th' accursed corpse be forthwith earth'd Beneath the public way, and with a stake Transfixed.— E. Marish. This is no longer to be borne!— That bloodhound of a Bishop would incite Your Highness to distain the English name With infamy indelible. We are your vassals, not your slaves; Soldiers, not executioners: 'Tis not for Englishmen tamely to see, Much less to act, a part in such vile savagery. Enter Captain of the Guard. Cap. My Lord, the Lady Eleanor De St Clair is dead. The soldiers are bearing her hither on their cross'd spears—It is a piteous sight to see her dripping locks trail in the dust.—Her story's known—'tis whispered from man to man; and he who hears, grasps fiercely his hilt, and says, 'Tis not well done, 'tis base, 'tis cowardly;—or utters some such note of indignation. I fear a tumult, if, as is murmured, she and the brave De Graham, for whose sake she came by her death, should be denied the accustomed rites of holy sepulture. D'Argent. I do agree with what Earl Marishall said; And would advise, that instantly The Lady Eleanor's remains should be restored To her bereaved father; and that De Graham Should be interred In Falkirk cell, with all observances Becoming his renown in chivalry. Bass. So think we all. De Val. All. Cap. An' please your Grace, a few words well chosen, from yourself, will soon appease the men. Ed. I'll come—But yet, methinks, 'tis hard That royal breath is needed to blow out This fetid farthing link of vulgar flame. But since nought else will do—we'll come. Greatness must sometimes bend. The stately swan Stoops the proud neck to take the tiny fry That glide beneath her feet. Follow, my lord. [Exeunt. SCENE V. —A Chamber in the Castle Prison (night).— Margaret in Chains, leaning on a Pillar. Enter Monteith. Mont. Fair lady, I am come with gracious boons Of pardon, from my now right Noble Master.— Why with such proud disdain still do you eye me? Am I still hateful in your sight? Is every word an arrow to your ear?— Perchance, you do not know the mighty change:— I'm now the favourite of a powerful prince; No more the humble friend of vanquish'd Wallace. 'Twas I who gained the battle for the King; And now I am the lord of wide domains Upon the banks of Thames;—and soon I'll bear An earl's name. Say, wilt thou share my honours?— Not even a word? disdainest even to speak?— What canst thou hope?—Wallace cannot escape. He'll ne'er be thine;—I know his every haunt; Each lurking place;—in them I've been his inmate. Think not of him;—it is in vain. Life, riches, honours,—love that equals his, I offer.— What!—still that look, without a word? That look which speaks a thousand, thousand words? O rather curse me with ten thousand curses!— Wilt thou not speak to me, lady?— Hear, then:—on one side thou behold'st All earthly good, and on the other—death, Disgrace, exposure to the gaping eyes Of crowds.— Half-famish'd goshawks shall pick out these eyes, And ravens riot on thy lovely limbs. Choose 'twixt these two extremes. No answer yet!—still this obdurate silence! That look averted, as I were some monster!— Say but one word—let me but hear the music Of thy voice, Tho' in a torrent of reproach. Still mute! Hear then still more—The life of Wallace hangs On thy award: giving thyself to me, Thou givest Wallace life. Ay—that can move thee: I do perceive a faint relenting dawn: Thou'lt not condemn him to his death: Thou willest that he should escape my toils.— Again that low'ring brow, and lightning eyes, As if they'd with their flashes dash me down!— Well, if his safety cannot make thee speak, Know, that I have the power to change thy doom From death, which now I see is all thy wish, To slow consuming durance in a cell, Dark, damp, and loathsome as the place Where your good friend the bishop is immured.— Still not a word, a breath, a sigh, a whisper Of entreaty?—Cannot I make thee weep? Art thou too proud to sue for mercy? Or dost thou think, that, but to touch my ear With words, thy lips would be contaminate? Take, then, thy fate—Chain'd, thou may'st rot, Until thy bones shall thro' thy flinching flesh Meet the deep-galling iron: But, long ere that, I ween, thou wilt be fain To beg the mercy which thou now disdain'st. [Exit. Marg. Wallace is safe, and will be so! I feel A glow of bright assurance thro' my soul, That such a wretch as this can ne'er have power Of life and death o'er Wallace. No—'mid the million instances Of villany, permitted to prevail O'er trampled virtue, this would so far surpass All past enormities, that, should it happen, I'd raise my hand to heaven, and dauntless swear,— God is unjust.—Yes, Wallace, thou art safe. Enter Jailor and Assistant, with irons. Jail. Lady, you come with us. Marg. Yes, he is safe! ye chains how light ye'll feel!— Ah me! but if he come to learn that I am thus!— O let me stay—take me not hence— I cannot 'scape—these bars are strong enough— These irons they are full weighty! I dread that man many ye've brought;—let me remain. Jail. Come along, come along—save your tears, for they cannot save you—Come along. [Exeunt. END OF ACT THIRD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —A Forest. Enter Robert and William à Rock. Rob. Where can the rest of our party be?— They've had time to be here. Will. They'll be here soon—and then for the merry feast, and then the merry song.—It was a rare buck —I ne'er shot truer in my life—I brought him down so quaintly, at such a distance too, just as he glanced past the opening among the hazels. Rob. No, faith, 'twas I—After my shot, I saw him lean his leathern side against a tree—I thought he'd then ha' dropt—and tho' he stagger'd on, 'twas but a little space. Will. I'll pawn my bow, that the arrow nearest to his heart was mine—While he lay dying, I marked it rising and falling in his sobbing side—I could not mistake—The fledge is red; 'twas ta'en from the pinion of a bird brought by my father from the holy land; and he told us, that ne'er an arrow fledged with it would miss the mark. Rob. Think you no one but you can have an arrow fledg'd with red? Will. Well, well; whoe'er kill'd him, I wish we had a slice of the haunch, hot from the brands.— Come let us light a fire here. No—'tis too soon yet; the sun is hardly down—But we'll have a merry night on't. Rob. All but Wallace—and yet I think my grief for Scotland's ills, is as great as his, though not quite so lasting. Will. Where is he now? how comes it that he so seldom joins us—always wandering, like a melancholy spirit, about poor Malcolm's hut? Rob. It is not for himself he mourns: it is for his country, and for us.—It was but yesterday I unobserved saw him, while you lay stretch'd asleep on the bare ground, clasp his hands together, and look on you with such a pitying face! and say, “Poor soul, 'twas I that led thee hither.”—But let us not think of that now—what must be, must be—We may now light a few chips—'Tis dark enough—the smoke will not be seen—I can count a dozen or two of stars —Hark, the bat's wing flitting past. Will. Come then—have you got any dried leaves?— But what if they have stopt in the Owlet Glen?— He was a right heavy one—We should go back to help them. Rob. No fear, they'll manage it—there's enow of them—Yonder they come—No—who can that be with Walter?— Enter Walter, with Fleming, a Scotish soldier. Walt. I've brought this man, who says he's of our side. He says he has escaped the ravening jaws Of bloodhounds, which the Southern victors use In hunting down the vanquish'd fugitives. In sooth I give full faith to what he says. Rob. 'Tis not for us to judge. He may or not Be a true man—and 'tis, I think, our duty To carry him to Wallace, who will judge. Flem. With all my heart. I wish no juster judge. Oft under his command I've fought, And, may be, tho' I've served in humblest station, He may remember me; for 'twas his wont To speak always with words and looks of kindness Ev'n to the meanest soldier in the field; And oft he asked me how I fared, And if I lack'd for aught.—Take me to him. Will. Take him, take him. Let's to the Owlet Glen; for there I'm sure Has Wallace and our other merrymen stopt. Rob. Well, well, let us go. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —Another part of the Forest. Enter Monteith and English soldiers. Mont. Soldiers, you've come too far—we're near the game. Go back, and lie concealed among the bushes, Until you hear my horn. Rush forward then. I'll give three blasts, two short ones, and one long. Seize fast the man I point to— Go back—keep close.— [Exeunt soldiers. Peace is all round me! How tranquil are these woods! how mild the moon, Rising, half-orb'd, above these lofty oaks!— Peace is all round me! all without is peace; While every thought within is torture. Success in guilt, is misery—failure, destruction. What shall I do? How shall I bear to meet his awful eye? He will suspect me—he may have heard— No! he will not suspect his faithful friend. Perfidious villain that I am! what then?— Can I undo the past—can I retreat— Can I again be honest?— Ah! no—my crimes—I cannot add to them. My treachery has murdered many thousands, And will affect ten thousands yet unborn. One other crime—what is it to the mass? Can guilt like mine be rendered more enormous? A dew drop, can it make more deep the ocean? The maid of Hexham loaded down with chains— Oh! what a deed! because she hated me, And loved my friend: Ay, she did love my friend, Therefore my enemy—and he shall die. My pity all is gone—I hate them both. Who comes—(listening)—who comes? I dread 'tis Wallace—Were this night but o'er— Enter Malcolm. Good even, aged man. Malc. Good even to thee, stranger. What is thy errand 'mong these lonesome wilds? Mont. I've wandered to these wilds, seeking a refuge From th' English sword. Malc. Welcome, good gentleman, might I be bold To give you welcome to a cottar's home!— You see that smoke that curls above the trees— There is our house—You'll for this night at least Abide with us.—I know you, by your tongue, You're not of Southern race. Mont. No, no, I am a Scot as true as steel: I've fought and bled along with William Wallace. Malc. Woes me, my sons have fought and bled with him. I had three sons, but now I am bereft— Two fell on Falkirk field, and one before: And yet I do rejoice, that in that cause They fell; and, had I fifty more, I'd rather see them weltering in their blood For freedom's sake, than wallowing in wealth For service done to England's hated King.— I was a soldier once. Mont. But say, old friend, that one should offer thee A manour fair, with purse of purest gold, On this condition, that thou shouldst disclose Where Wallace is concealed—Couldst thou resist? Malc. I'd spurn and spit upon the wretch. Mont. I've heard that such reward has been proclaimed. Malc. I fear thou'rt not a leal true-hearted man. Mont. Thy fear is most unjust—I did but try thee, And now I'll trust thee. Know, then, that I am Sir John Monteith, and boast me that I am The friend of Wallace. Thee too have I seen; Perhaps thou mayst remember me. Malc. God's blessing on you, knight—Who would have thought— In sooth I do remember well that time, When, near this spot, you and the Wallace met, After long absence, and much peril past In these same wars—I saw your right hands join, And grasp, as they would ne'er ha' parted more; I saw the blithe blink light up Wallace' een— Tho' then he was in hardship sore; and you, Ye smiled and smiled. Mont. Ay, much he loved, and much he trusted me. God send he may be well, for Scotland's sake. Malc. What if I have the power to bring you to him? Mont. O good old man! but is his wound yet healed? Malc. 'Tis almost well—'Twas but the other day I saw him bend a bow, till the two horns Had almost met; a bow, that my old arm Could scarce have strung.—But come, Before I bring you to him, I do hope You'll not think 'tis beneath you to break bread Under a poor man's roof: our Agatha Will be right proud if ye would taste Our fare.—Great Wallace oft has praised her skill; Oft has he sat him down at our fire side, And with his dagger cut our simple herbs; And he would stroak my orphan o's lint locks, My eldest son's poor child, And set him on his knee; and the big tear Would start in Wallace' ee—ay, Wallace wept; Nor would he let me stand, or doff my bonnet. Mont. O how I long again to embrace my friend! Malc. Come, good Sir John—He's not far off. Ere this he's with them in the Glen. [Exeunt. SCENE III. —A Glen in the Forest. Enter Frazer and De Bois—laying down their bows. De Bois. We've had a merry day. Fra. I wish that Wallace had been with us. The sport might have suspended for a time His moody sadness. Misfortune never used To weigh so heavy on his mind. I saw him yester-noon stand a full hour, With folded arms, and gaze With unmoved eyes upon the babbling stream. I wish we could get word that all goes well With Margaret the maid of Hexeldham. De Bois. And with the other prisoners. Enter Forester, and other Refugees. For. Where are the rest? Have you seen aught of Wallace? Fra. He will be here anon—Have you made ready? For. Yes, on the flags beside the stream. The moon is clear—we'll need no other light. We'll have a merry feast:—Guy o' the Cave Is come; and he will sing us blythesome songs Till we are tired—and he has led with him The poor blind harper, who did play and sing The night before we won Cambuskenneth field: 'Twas all 'bout war, and death, and liberty; And, while he sung, and when he ceased, We thought the Summer night was all too long, And wish'd, and wish'd, to see the rising sunbeams Gleam from the English steel. He now is sitting at the blasted oak. Hark, hark, I hear him thrum, to tune his strings. Hear—he plays. (sound of harp heard faintly— —Gil Morris. Fra. His voice now joins—how soothing! now, how grand! 'Tis done— Faintly the echo floats from rock to rock, As 'twere the soul of the departed strain.— That's surely Wallace coming there?— I see he's clearing up his clouded brow, And struggling hard to seem a happy man. Ah! that's the very depth of misery. I know it. Enter Wallace. Wall. Good even, Frazer—Brothers, God bless you all. Ye've had a long day's work. 'Tis time ye should have different sport. I think 'tis near our hour, if by the moon's height I may judge.—Where are our other friends, Robert and Walter, and merry Will o' the Rock? Where are they all? For. I'll warrant they'll be here. Will o' the Rock Has a keen nose—he'll wind the roasting haunch. I guess he is, ere now, helping the fire. No, there they come. Enter Robert, Walter, Will o' the Rock, and Fleming. Walt. We've brought this man, who says, he's of our side, And wishes to be of our company. Rob. He'll tell his story best himself. Wall. Stranger, tell now the very truth. We're forced to take this course, lest we admit False friends into our band. Beware of falsehood, For falsehood often gives itself the lie; And if we find thee varying in thy tale, Thou diest.—Now, tell us all, how thou camest here— From whence, and for what cause. Flem. I see, great Wallace, that you have forgot The traces of my countenance, tho' oft You've spoke to me. My name is Fleming— I fought near you at Cambuskenneth field, And saw you, though unhors'd, bring to the ground The Brabant Knight. Wall. 'Twas of yourself we wished to hear. Flem. At Falkirk, too, I fought, and fled, and 'scaped. Wall. Hast thou heard aught about the prisoners, The Bishop, or the maid of Hexham, or Monteith? Flem. Not much I know:—All that I know, I'll tell. With others of our men I southward fled; But soon we parted, to elude pursuit. Weary and faint, when I had stopt to rest, And lookt to trace the way that I had come, I saw the distant cottages in flames. Still faster then I sped: but, well I ween, I soon must have dropt down for want of food, Had not I met a poor old beggar man, Who, from his scrip, besought me to take bread. The second day from that on which we fought, While, stretch'd at noon beneath a tree, I dug The sav'ry arnuts from the turf,—sudden I heard the bloodhound's distant deep-toned voice— I strove to think it was the wild bee's hum; But soon it open'd louder on my ear; And yet, thought I, it must be nobler game They chase—some knight, at least, doom'd to the axe.— But still the sound approach'd.—Forward I sprung Thro' brake and briar, and gain'd so much, That soon the following sound I scarce discerned.—I stopt, and thought me safe. Loud, and more loud, again it swell'd—Forward Again I rush. Thus, with alternate rest And flight, full many a wood and deep-sunk glen I pass'd, and curs'd the smallness of the streams. Worn out at last, against a tree I leant, My head upon my arm, panting for breath. I could not bend, thro' weariness, To stretch me on the ground.—I had resolved To wait and meet my death,—when, on the breeze, I heard, I thought, a cataract's distant dash. It must, must be the broad and full-stream'd Clyde; In it they'll lose my track. Forward I flew, As if new-nerv'd;—life was the prize;— I reach'd the bank, plung'd in, and plied my arms.— I caught the osiers on the other side; Nor staid I there, but pierced far in the woods; And, ere I stopt, my drench'd clothes were quite dry. That night I slept upon a mossy bank: I thought I heard the dreadful howl again, And waked in horror:—But what was my joy, To feel the sunbeams, to hear the thrush's note, To see the wildflowers blooming 'bout my face! Wall. But tell, how came you here? you must have cross'd The Clyde once more. Flem. Some time I wandered on the southern bank, Avoiding towns, and every haunt of man. This day I cross'd again, where Calder joins, And bent my steps towards this forest deep, Where well I thought to meet with banish'd men; And near the skirts I met one of your band. Wall. And did you meet, and hold converse with none, Saving the poor old man? Flem. This day, at noon, I saw a shepherd's boy tending some sheep Beside a lonely burn. I did not fear To speak to him. Wall. What did he say? Flem. I ask'd, if he had heard aught of the fight? At which the tear swam in his eye: He said, that there his brother had been slain.— I then did question him about your safety: He said you had escaped; but that De Graham Was dead; and that the Bishop and the maid Of Hexeldham were kept in Stirling tower, Chain'd in a place they call the dead man's den. Wall. O God! Flem. He said too, it was bruited that the day Was lost thro' falseness of Sir John Monteith— De Bois. I told you, Wallace, that I did suspect Your friend Monteith. Wall. Ev'n yet, I'll not suspect Monteith. Suspicion, scowling thro' her bloodshot eyes, Sees white-rob'd Innocence, as if array'd In deep-stain'd red. But it shall ne'er be said of Wallace, That he condemn'd his friend, without some proofs More relative than common bruit.— How many peasants, whose hard hands scarce earn The pittance that supplies their little board, Have spurn'd the rich reward, the golden crop They might have reap'd, by treachery to me! But they did love me—for I trusted them. And can it be believed, that he—my friend, A knight most worthy, seised of large domains, Should prove a traitor? Enter Malcolm. Malc. My Lord, my Lord, here comes Sir John Monteith! Wall. I knew he never would desert his friend. Enter Monteith. Most welcome! thrice welcome! How did ye 'scape?—What of the other prisoners? Mont. Happy am I the noble Wallace lives. No matter how I 'scaped.—I bring good news. Wall. What are they?—tell—how are the prisoners? Mont. They're well, and not far hence. Wall. Be brief—haste—your meaning? Mont. The maid of Hexham, Wishart, and myself, 'Scaped by a strange and cunning stratagem, After some weeks imprisonment. Wall. Tell me not how—but where? Mont. Well, we escaped.—Two nights we lay conceal'd Among the deepest dells of the Torwood. To-day we reach'd this forest skirts, and struggled Thro' pathless wilds, unknown, and difficult. About a mile from hence fair Margaret stopt, Unable to proceed, and with her waits The good and faithful Bishop. Wall. Haste—lead me—O joy!— O were my country, too, in safety! You, Walter, will come with me. Mont. We soon shall reach them. Wall. Lead on, quick. [Exeunt Wallace, Monteith, and Walter. De Bois. I do not like this. Fraz. Nor I. Malc. Brave gentlemen, what is't ye mean? De Bois. Nothing, old man—we only did not like That Wallace now went off; for, if he tarries, The venison will be over done. Malc. Is that—is that it all?— Will o' Rock. Dost thou call that, all?— 'Tis a mishap deeply to be deplored. De Bois. I do not like Monteith—I fear his look— I thought he blanch'd, when first his eye met Wallace's. Fra. It is impossible he can prove false—and yet I've often marked, Beneath his brows his eyes gleam guiltily, Like some ferocious beast's In a deep darksome cave, couch'd close, unseen, All but the glaring orbs: I've sometimes thought I saw his conscious soul at squat. The Bishop—and the maid of Hexham here! It cannot be—'twas an ill hanging tale. Will o' Rock. I hear a horn—they're coming— We shall have supper now. Fraz. It was not Wallace's horn—I heard three blasts, Two short ones, and a long—What can it mean? I do suspect foul play—Yet one dare not suspect. Hear, hear again!—It is the English tivy! De Bois. Up!—treason!—to arms!—where are the spears? Where—where are all our men?— Fraz. Blow the bugle!—haste!— (bugle sounds. Haste, all that are here!—haste, follow me!— The rest will follow—no odds shall stop me. [Exeunt—bugle sounding. (Foresters running armed across the Stage.) [Exeunt—bugle sounding more and more distant. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. —A Chamber in the Tower of London— Wallace in chains, asleep on a couch. Enter Wishart, accompanied by a Warder. Wish. How fast asleep! The chequered morning ray Plays thro' the grate upon his godlike face, Yet wakes him not: how calm, how calm his rest! O Virtue! thou canst sleep serene,—tho' death Stand by the couch, and, like the hungry lion, Watch for the opening of his victim's eye, To strike.—When, Warder, did he go to rest? Ward. Just as St Catherine's bell struck twelve. Wish. Behold that smile—he dreams that Scotland's free. Sleep on—How gently placid now his look! His soul floats tranquil on the storm of fate, As the toss'd seabird, with its wing-veil'd head, Sleeps reckless of the billow's rise or fall. Wall. (awaking) Who speaks? Wish. Do ye not know me, Wallace? Wall. My father! Wish. My son! (they embrace. Wall. When, whence, how came you here?— Where left you Margaret? Wish. In an apartment in the eastern turret: She is well. Wall. I knew before, that you and she were inmates Of this prison; but, till now, I never could Obtain reply to questions 'bout your welfare: Such is their needless, barbarous secrecy. But oh! is Margaret in chains?— Wish. She is, but feels them light: your's weigh her down. Ward. I'll step, so please you, into the antichamber. Wish. Good Warder, do. [Exit Warder. Wall. What means that heavy cloud upon your brow? What come you to announce?—Are you now free? And how have you obtained your freedom? As for my fate, speak out without reserve— I know the sentence—I am doom'd to die. Wish. To introduce the tidings which I bear, By hints, and downcast looks, as if you feared To die, I never meant. You die this day. I'll tell you all. The Peers last night, After you were remanded to this place, Remain'd in deep consult, what course to follow. Some of them, in respect of what they called Your contumacy, in that you did not plead In answer to the charge, proposed the peine fort et dur, Which is, that on your breast there should be laid A massive stone; and that your only drink Should be the water of the foulest pool; And that you should remain stretch'd 'neath the weight, Until you own'd or did deny your guilt. Wall. Impotent miserables! tho' they should pile Mount Ætna on my breast, with all his fires— But haste—proceed— Wish. This barbarous counsel came from Beck. But it was over-ruled. The final sentence Was this;—that you this day should be beheaded Upon Towerhill. Wall. Edward! how I contemn thee! Thou think'st that death to me is punishment: My mind thou measur'st by thy own. Wish. To me they did intend a similar doom, Had not the Legate John of Canterbury Imposed his veto, backing it with threats Of interdiction, if I were not freed. Besides, he boldly did gainsay the King (Who order'd that no priest should be allowed To shrieve and comfort you) with such firm tone, That Edward was obliged, feigning humility, His order to recal, and set me free. Wall. Most Noble Canterbury! I honour thee! But speak of Margaret—I fear to ask— I cannot guess— They do not mean to murder her too?— Wherefore that silence? Wish. Would that this dreadful duty lay not on me: She dies with you: Her sentence is the same. Be comforted—Your souls will fly to heaven, United e'er they reach the skies. Wall. Oh God! I am the cause. She dies for me. She'll curse the day she ever join'd our host. Wish. I do mistake the maid of Hexeldham, If that she will not glory in her death. Wall. Ay! and she will look pleas'd, and she will smile Upon the axe—But yet a woman's heart Is soft—'Twill be a conflict 'tween her love For me, and dread of death. She'll strive to look Undaunted— Wish. And more—she will be dauntless. Wall. No, no; for tho' she's used to sights of death, She's gentle—Death, in this deliberate form, Must needs appal her.—Would that I could die For thee! I am the cause.—Poor maid, Thy little day of life has been all storm.— My Margaret! orphan, friendless maid, 'twas I Who brought thee to this cruel end. O Christ Support her spirit.—She would love to live, To weep upon my grave, and die of grief, And not be rudely butcher'd on a stage.— Good father, will they not give me leave, Before the fatal hour, to visit Margaret? Wish. I'll go endeavour to obtain permission. In half an hour I'm promised leave to see her. My mournful duty done, I will return, And from my hands you shall receive The holy Eucharist.—Farewell— Of this world think no more. [Exit. Wall. Of what a mass of misery thou'rt the cause, Thou king of kings of traitors, base Monteith!— The sum of woe, which ev'n one wretch can work, Who wills to be a villain, far exceeds All power of reckoning—while the utmost good Which he can do, whose every wish, whose soul Is made of love to God and man, how small! How small th' amount! Enter Lieutenant of Tower, and Warder. Lieut. Good morrow, prisoner. Wall. My humble thanks are yours. Lieut. The Bishop doubtless has disclosed to you The sentence which this day you're doom'd to suffer. The loss of life and lands—your body quarter'd, And expos'd i' th' chiefest cities of the realm— Such is the sentence of the law: But yet that sentence our most gracious King Will even still remit, on this condition, Which I am ordered now to offer you,— That you repent you of your evil ways, And join the King to quell that base rebellion, Which once again, like to an ill-healed wound, Has broken out since your captivity. Wall. And is there yet some life in Scotchmen!— Go tell your prince, how I exult to hear That yet there is a hope that they will wrench Their country from his gripe—Tell him, I joy To die in freedom's cause—Tell him, that life, Or any favour, if conferr'd by him, Tho' not receiv'd as honour's price, Would be to me a curse—Tell him, I know That each drop of my blood will be reveng'd With purple rivers pour'd from English veins. No, say not that;—his men, poor knaves! are guiltless. Lieut. Think, to be quarter'd, and to be exposed, The feast of ravens, and the jest of clowns! Wall. Why, then, I shall surmount The very gates that open'd at my name.— Quarter'd!—torn!— What so relentless as a tyrant's malice! It does survive its victim; 'Tis like the raging of th' infuriate waves, Which, as if all unsated with the life Of the poor mariner they've overwhelm'd, Still dash and mangle his drown'd corse Upon the rugged rocks. Horrid!—that fate awaits the maid of Hexham.— Lieutenant—good Lieutenant!— I pray you, do not heed the hasty words In which I have rejected Edward's offer— I meant no disrespect to you— Might I not see, before we are led forth, My fellow prisoner, the maid of Hexeldham? Lieut. My orders are precise against such meeting. Farewell till noon—I hope you'll be prepared. You've still the freedom of this outer chamber. [Exeunt Lieut. and Warder, followed by Wallace. SCENE II. —Another Chamber in the Tower. Margaret (in woman's dress.) Marg. This prison gloom—the tedious nights and days I'm doom'd to pine—these rough tear-rusted chains— The sounds of busy life that reach my ear, Making this solitude seem like a loss Of being— The fear of death itself—These miseries Vanish, compar'd with dread uncertainty Concerning those we love.—Does Wallace live?— Sure that's a question leading to no harm, And yet my savage keepers answer not, Save sometimes with a dark ambiguous look— Silence more cruel than death-knelling words. Enter Wishart. Wish. Margaret! my daughter! Marg. O God, I thank thee— How, good Lord Bishop—father—how is Wallace? Wish. He's well, my child in God, beloved child— Be comforted. Marg. Why look ye so?—ye've something sad to say. Ye dare not speak— Your lips seem loaded with some horrid tale.— Is Wallace dead? Wish. He lives—but soon must die. This day he dies. Marg. Most holy Virgin, save me.— Can I live?—Yes, I will live To look upon his death— Let me but see him die— At his heart's blood I'll look, And then perforce I'll die— O Wallace! Wish. Take comfort, dearest lady; think of him Who died for all—he looks upon your tears. Enter Lieutenant, and Warder. Lieut. Lord Bishop, you'll retire; We'll readmit you soon.— [Exit Wishart. Most loath am I to be the messenger Of the dire words which now I must deliver. This day you're doom'd to die on the same scaffold With that arch-traitor Wallace. Marg. Speak—speak again—did you say right— I die? Lieut. I said. Marg. Most blessed day—with Wallace I shall die— I am not to be left behind— O day of joy!— Lieut. But, lady, there is still a way by which You may preserve yourself, and Wallace too. Sir John Monteith, in Edward's name, thro' me, Now says, that if you will forthwith consent To be the wife of him Sir John Monteith, The life of Wallace and yourself shall be The high reward. Marg. Life! what is life!—most strange reward! Most noble privilege of enjoying pain!— Wallace's life to Scotland were a prize, But to himself 'tis naught. As for the base condition of your offer, I spurn at it.—Rather than be the wife, Rather than breathe the same polluted air With that most vile Monteith,— Than save the life of Wallace At such a price!—Rather I would myself Uplift the axe against the life of Wallace, Inflict the stroke, hold up his head, and cry, This is the head of a traitor! Then drink his blood, gushing from every vein:— Rather I'd live With hissing serpents, winding round my waist, In some deep, noisome dungeon of a ruin, In which the glimmering taper would go out, Where night from day I only could discern By the owl's hoot:—Far rather I would bear All kinds of torture, even Wallace's love Changed into deadly hate—ev'n that I'd bear, Rather than live one day, one hour, one instant, In sight of him whose very name 'tis loathsome To repeat. Lieut. And is the life of Wallace, in your eyes, Of no account? Marg. You know not him—Wallace would rather die, Would rather see me die, than see me live Dishonoured. Lieut. Know, then, I am commissioned to announce, That he this day shall die, and thou shalt live. Marg. Mother of God! have mercy— Lieut. And thou shalt live the wife of him thou hat'st, And to the altar, struggling, shalt be dragg'd. 'Tis Edward's promise, which must be fulfilled, Tho' to a knave; else other knaves would fear To trust his faith.—This is his stedfast will. Think of it. [Exeunt Lieut. and Warder. Marg. Come to me, death.—Since no resource is left, I'm doom'd to dare the wrath of heaven. Dear, and long-treasured steel! (drawing a dagger from her bosom. Now is the exigent for which I kept thee. There is no terror in thy point for me. Sweet, sweet will be thy gliding thro' my heart. O death, I love thee—for thy dart, to me, Seems fledg'd with heavenly hope;—thro' thy dark ribs I see a smiling angel wait behind. But is not this self-murder?—No, 'tis choice Of deaths. Eternal Justice cannot blame The preference. Or, if Omnipotence Condemn the deed, I'll bear the dread award.— Yes, Wallace, I'll pass on before thou com'st, That thou may'st meet thy death with unmixt joy To meet with me. Come then, blest steel, I may not have thee long: The power of death is a prerogative Which tyrants wrench from every meaner hand.— Why should I hesitate?—Say 'tis a crime— Between the perpetration of the deed, And my soul's flight, I may obtain forgiveness. The Almighty God, who in a moment changed A universe of darkness into light, Can, in the merest point of time, relume, With beams of love, the deep guilt-darken'd soul: Jesu died not in vain. O God— (stabs herself. My God, this deed, For my Redeemer's sake, forgive! Enter Lieutenant, and Warders. Lieut. Wounded! a dagger! whence came it? What means that smile triumphant? Tell me, whence came the dagger? Marg. It was my bosom friend— I'm now beyond your ruthless master's power.— But, good Lieutenant, if you've mercy in you, Bring to me Wallace, or bear me to him. A woman's dying prayer, can you refuse? Lieut. It must not be. Marg. Give me some air—take me out— Lieut. Bear her into the hall. [Exeunt Lieut. and Warders, supporting Margaret. SCENE III. —The Tower. Wallace's Apartment. Wall. Scotland again in arms!—Yes, there is hope That justice in the issue will prevail; That England, all-rapacious, will be foiled, And Scotland freed.—Tho' clouds brood round my head, I see a gleam of hope: amid the storm, I can discern, upon the distant hills, A sunny beam, which soon will spread all round. O were this arm but free!— And yet, mayhap, my death may do more good Than could my life: The just man's blood cries loud To God and man for vengeance, Makes brave men heroes, makes the coward brave, Confirms the wavering, and unites all hearts.— What a strange hum all round about the walls! They come betimes to this old tragedy. I hear some busy hammers too. Edward! perhaps thou think'st these sounds appal me. Enter Wishart. Speak quick—is leave permitted? am I to see her? Or must our meeting be upon the scaffold? Wish. No—not there; Your Margaret is wounded to the death By her own hand. Wall. Bring me to her—I must, I shall behold her— I'll burst the walls!— She is not dead? Wish. No—but the keepers are inflexible. She did beseech and pray the stern lieutenant— She took her blood-dyed hands from off her breast, And stretch'd them forth in supplicating guise— She tried to kneel—but, as she stoopt, the wound Did seem to catch her with its pain— And, when she could no longer speak, her eyes, Her beauteous eyes she lifted up to him, With such a piteous look, that, had he been Of human stuff, he must have yielded. (Drum heard beating dead march. Enter Lieutenant, Warders, and Soldiers. Lieut. The maid of Hexham's out—we've borne her forth: She waits you on the scaffold. She vainly thought to shun the sword of justice; And, but for this her wicked godless act, You might have lived perhaps some two hours longer. But now there is no time to lose, Lest she should die without the hangman's help. 'Tis best to make one business of you both. Wall. Haste—lead me out! Margaret, I come. Scotland, I die for thee. [Exeunt. (Dead beat continues for some minutes— —trumpets sound at intervals.) SCENE IV. —The Palace in London. Enter Edward, Beck, and Attendants. Ed. He cannot yet be dead—'tis not mid-day— I'll not believe I'm safe till he be dead. Beck. The hour must come—be not impatient. Enter Messenger. Mess. My Lord, Wallace is dead; And with him died the maid of Hexeldham. Enter Earl Marishall. Marish. I'm come from seeing a deep tragedy. Sir William Wallace is no more. He died A glorious death.—Margaret of Hexeldham Had made attempt upon her life, but fail'd. She was borne forth, half-dead, upon the scaffold, Pale, faded, like the lunar rainbow. Wallace came next—he clasp'd her bleeding. The sheriff parted them.—She laid her head, With smiling look, upon the block, and lift Her lily arm as signal for the stroke. Within the minute, William Wallace stoop'd, And suffer'd death.—A silence deep ensued:— But, in a breath, the giddy multitude, As if incited by some sudden phrenzy, Blended with pity for the ruthless act That had been done, burst into rage, and sought To have Sir John Monteith;—and, since I left The horrid scene, I've learnt that to his castle They've bent their way with deathful purpose. Ed. Why, Marishall, have you not by force of arms Prevented them? Marish. Impossible—you might as well propose With a sword's edge to stop the roaring cataract. Enter another Messenger. Mess. My Lord, the Scotish rising still extends. The men of Tiviotdale, the men of Tweed, Are all in arms—and Roxburgh tower is ta'en. [Exit. Marish. An' please your Grace, what's nearest home, Ought to be nearest to your heart. Be pleased direct what should be done To quell the riot—if now it can be quelled. Ed. Let the wretch take his fate; his treachery Has done no good. Marish. This is your will? Ed. It is. [Exeunt separately. SCENE V. —Monteith's Castle on the Surrey side of Thames. —Monteith— Mont. How soft the gale, Wafting the fragrance of the bending flowers! How sweet the carols of the woodland choirs! Let me enjoy them now—sure they are pleasant. But are they so to me?—No; not to me. He who enjoys a mind at peace, can hear The woodland song with joy, can breathe with joy Fragrance from flowers:—But to the guilty wretch, To me, objects of joy and peace are torment. What are these wide domains! these beauteous woods! The sweet bird's song is harsh.— Perhaps more cunning music may allay The aching of my breast. Boy—who is there? Enter Servant. Send in the Scotish minstrel—no, not in— He'll be too near.— Tell him to play beneath the window. [Exit Servant. Scotland!—thy hills!— Must I ne'er see you more!—No, never more— Monteith must ne'er return. Altho' no tongue Should dare to utter aught against my deeds, Each Scotchman's eye would scowl and scowl on me; Children would run from me, and nurses make A goblin of my name, to hush their babes.— Ev'n in the English towns, where Wallace rode, It was to him a triumph; Ladies their kerchiefs waved, And then wiped off the silent tear. I closed The cavalcade; but was received with looks, With words of scorn, of hate, e'en by the mob. (The air of Lochaber heard without. What does he mean?—ho!— Enter Servant. Haste, tell him to play no more that tune; Tell him to break his strings, and crush his harp— Go!— [Exit Servant. I hate these sounds—these soft, these melting strains. Give me a drum—and let it constant beat Close at my ear, to stun my very soul, And drown the bawling of this scoundrel conscience. Enter Messenger. Mess. Wallace, my Lord, is dead. Mont. What of the maid of Hexham? Mess. She, too, has suffered death. Mont. She—who?—villain!— Mess. Margaret, the maid of Hexham, she is dead— She did reject with scorn the offer'd pardon— And when she heard that force would be employed To make her yours, she stabb'd herself. All bleeding as she was, they bore her forth: Meekly upon the block she laid her neck, And suffer'd; And then, on the same block, Sir William Wallace. Mont. Begone!—I wish to hear no more. [Exit Messenger. O sweet and bitter cup!—Wallace is dead— Of him I've got my heart's wish. But, was her death the recompence I sought, Thro' labyrinths dark of damned treachery! Margaret, I've murder'd thee!—Thy dying curse Is on my head—The curse of every man Who looks on me, lurks in his eye,—is couch'd Upon his lip ready to spring at me;— A finish'd murderer! compar'd to whom, Herod himself was one o' th' innocents. Oh! is there no peace for me—no place For pardon left!—No, wretch—to hope, to think Of pardon, will but bring heavier perdition On thy devoted soul: the Deity May blot thy being out, but has not power To pardon thee.— O God! could I but from thy presence flee— O that 'twere night!—I hate, I hate the sun; For when he shines, I think that God is present, And that he looks a sentence dire on me. Come, sightless night!—ay, now 'tis night— The sun is up—and yet, I think, I see the sky Studded with stars.—My brain is all on fire— Ho—lights! Enter Servant. Shut out the sun.— Ser. What is your Lordship's pleasure? Mont. Lights, I say—shut out the sun— Shut every crevice up! [Exit Servant. Wallace is dead—I sentenc'd him to death; There's comfort in that thought:—but then he died With Margaret, and they have met in heaven, And see me doom'd to ever-during woe— Beyond despair. (Stage darken'd. Enter Servant with lights—Monteith not perceiving them. Ser. Here are the lights, my Lord. [Exit. Mont. Ay, now I am myself— Here is a little world, And I the sole inhabitant— None here can say, that I do wrong— God looks not on me here.— Enter Servant. Ser. My Lord, there is a crowd approaching; But what they are, we scarcely can discern, There's such a cloud of dust moving along. Mont. 'Twill be the King—he comes to grace My new fledg'd honours—Haste, prepare the hall. [Exit Servant. O splended misery! hell of molten gold! Re-enter Servant. Ser. My Lord, 'tis not the King, but a vile mob, Seeking your life, in vengeance of the death Of Wallace and the maid of Hexeldham, Which have, it seems, enraged them even to madness. They do demand immediate entrance, And say they have obtain'd the royal leave. Mont. Allow that six should enter— I will speak with them. [Exit Servant. What can this mean?—Is't possible the King Can have deserted me—have given me up— Is he a traitor too?—Perfidious wretch!— And yet it cannot be—Who now would serve him?— Enter Six Citizens of London. Mont. What, worthy citizens, are your demands? Why thus assembled 'gainst the King's peace? 1. Cit. We have the royal leave—we seek your life— Your life alone can still the multitude— They dread some curse upon the city, If such a wretch as you remain unpunish'd. Mont. This is impossible.—Take me to the King. 2. Cit. Few words—we have the King's leave. Mont. I do beseech you, gentlemen— 2. Cit. Pray not to us.—Pray, if you dare, to God.— You die;—the rope is hanging from your porch:— If you don't haste, they will break in, And tear you limb from limb. Come along— [Exeunt, dragging him out.
