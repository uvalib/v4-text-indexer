      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Country near Mexico. Enter Cortez, Vasquez, Pizarro, with Spaniards, and Indians of their Party. Cort. On what new happy climate are we thrown! It looks as if old nature, purged by fire, Had past the general doom, and here arose A new-created world. Vasq. By science unrefined, this world is laid In nature's simple lap. Mechanic arts Hold no republic here; but all is wild And savage, as the soil. Cort. Savage and wild, Are terms we give to fashions not our own. Better, perhaps, that man had yet been left, To the rude dictates of his native virtue; Than to be wrought and polished into vice, By arts too much refined. Piz. The soil, though savage, yields spontaneous plenty, Beyond what toil and culture can produce In our o'erlabour'd world. This country is The fabled Danae, sure, in whose fair lap The glittering Jove descended: mountain floods Here pour a golden torrent; here again, The lucid stream, with rich vicissitude, Flows o'er a bed of silver. Vasq. Ay, this is worth A soldier's fighting forâthe great reward, The prize beyond compare, which Heaven reserves For unexampled valour; since we dare, With scarce one squadron, and a few brave foot, To war upon a new found world. Cort. Pizarro, Valour is not sustain'd by vanity. Far, far unequal were our power to that Of mighty Montezuma, did not faction Divide these savages against themselves: The spacious empire of the late Traxalla, Groaning beneath the yoke of Mexico, Crouds our thin ranks, and sues to us for freedom. We will not yet proceed, by close deceit, Or lawless rapine; we shall first propose The sword, or branch of peace, to their election. Say, guide, how far to Mexico? 1st Ind. A league Brings you within the prospect of the city, That rises from the lake, as newly bathed, And shines to either shore. 2d Ind. This morning's sun Rose on the day that gave their monarch birth; And solemn rites, such as may suit his pride And their servility, are now preparing. Cort. ForwardâMarch, friends!âI gladly would be present At this imperial festivalâBut, mark me; Let not an Indian raise his arm in anger, Not, for his life, till justice, and the word, Shall give his weapon weight. Proceed, brave friends! Honour's the road that best leads on to conquest. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An Indian Temple. High Priest, and other PriestsâTo them a Messenger. Mess. Dispatch, ye holy priestsâthe King approaches. Priest. We for his royal presence only wait, To end our solemn rites. Five hundred captives Beheld the morning sun, whose eyes no more Shall open to the lightâYour incense now On this fair altar, sacred to the Power Of Love, heap largely; till the clouds ascend In fragrance to his godhead. SCENE III. Enter Montezuma, Odmar, Cyderia, Almeria, Alibech, Orbellan, and Train. They place themselves. H. Priest. All hail to Montezuma, to our King, Son of the Sun, and father of his people! May he behold his subjects celebrate This happy natal day, from year to year, Till time shall be no moreâ Other Priests. Hail! Hail! Hail! H. Priest. Sound instruments! and let the vocal choir Perform the hymn to Beauty. HYMN. I. Tell us, ye gods, what power is this, That rules with such resistless sway; To whom the mightiest bow submiss, Whom crouds adore, whom kings obey? II. It is the power of Beauty's charm, That can all other powers subdue, The savage tame, the fierce disarm, And teach subjected pride to sue. III. Great monarch! if you haply find The force of her enchantment here, Her temples with your garland bind, And crown her empress of the year. [Montezuma rises, goes to Almeria, bows, and offers the Garland, which she rejects. Mont. Since my Orazia's death, I have not seen A beauty so deserving of a crown, As fair Almeria. Alm. Me, my lord, to meâ The daughter of those dear and royal parents, Who fell the victims of your dire ambition; Whose crown you have usurp'd, whose wretched subjects Still bend beneath the weight of your oppression! What may your mightiness demand, in lieu Of such beneficence? Mont. Your pardon, first; And next, your pity. Alm. Such as you conferr'd On great Taxalla, my unhappy father, Receive the like from me. Mont. Think, fair Almeria, If I deprived thy father of a crown, I lay a brighter at his daughter's feet; And yeild myself and my dominions up, The conquest of her charms. Alm. Yes, Montezuma, It is a conquest I do glory in, That I, with tyranny and pride, like thine, May exercise my power. Mont. The gods, themselves, Require but our submission for our faults, And then delight to pardon. Heaven is thus Best worship'd and appeased. [Kneels. Orbel. Behold, Almeria, [Kneels. Your brother also bends, and joins the suit Of supplicating majesty! Alib. Your sister, [Kneels. Low at your feet, with like prostration, bows, And sues for favour to our royal master. Orbel. Think, with what joy, our late disastrous parents, Will look from Heaven to see their crown restored, And placed, with double lustre, on the head Of their Almeria. Alm. WellâI do accept Your garland; not as any instance, meant, Of grace or favour in return; but merely, As the submissive mark of homage, due To the supremacy and rights of Beauty. [Montezuma places the Garland on her Head. SCENE IV. Guyomar enters. Odm. My brother Guyomar!âhis steps are hasty; And his amazed countenance foretells Uncommon tidings. Mont. What, my Guyomar, So soon return'd?âI sent thee to the frontiers. Guy. I went, dread sir, by your command, to view The utmost limits of our land; that shore, Beyond whose beaten verge no world is found, Save a wild waste of waters and of air, Illimitable. There I stood, awhile, And ponder'd on the vast expanse, stretch'd out, Perhaps, to infinite: when, as I look'd, As far as my capacious ken could take The wide horizon in, even to the line Where the low bending vault of Heaven appear'd To rest on oceanâsomewhat thence arose Like clouds, at first unshapely; large, and larger, As near, and nearer they approach'd, they grew In bulk and figures, of amazing form, And terrible distinction! Mont. Say, my son, To what known figures may you best compare Their wonderful appearance? Guy. First, they seem'd A moving forest; but, instead of leaves And spreading branches, they assumed such wings, As left it doubtful if they swam in air, Or skim'd the surface of the seasâAnon, As near and nearer they approach'd, they grew Of wondrous bulk beneath; and now they seem'd A floating city, with aspiring tops Of sheeted towers, and pinnacles that gave Their streamers to the wind. Mont. Ye mighty gods! What may these monsters bode?âDid they appear As things inanimate? Guy. If voice and motion Give evidence of life, they lived too surely. To right and left I saw them turn, with ease, Their vast enormity: I heard their word; They breathed destructive fires, and spoke in thunders. They are, surely, of the race of those above, Who whirl the rapid tempest from on high, And launch the dreaded lightnings. Mortal courage No longer could sustain the horrid visionâ I do confess, I fledâfor the first time, My feet avowed my fears. H, Priest. A prophecy of ancient date imports The failure of our state, when bearded men Shall land in floating palaces. Mont. Go straightâ Solicit, and enquire of all our gods, What these portents foreshew, that we may learn To stand the fate that cannot be avoided.â [Exeunt Priests. In the mean season, let our rites proceed. Odmar, our kingdom's heir, our eldest born, Let thine electing wreath, in public here, Avow the secret mistress of thine heart. Within this starry round of dazzling beauties, All daughters of the Sun, all fair and bright As the refulgent sire from whom they sprung, Thou canst not chuse amiss. Odm. Alas, my father, I have no choice to makeâlong since determin'd By fond and irresistible attractions, My movements center hereâ [Places his Wreath on the Head of Alibech. Mont. Well placed, my son!â Next to the beauties of divine Almeria, The world could yield no choice like Alibech, The sister of Perfection. Alib. Pray you, pardon. My humble state permits me not to scorn The grace you mean meâI accept your garland, But must reserve my heart. Mont. Now, Guyomar, Our kingdom's second hope!âto what fair shrine Does thy devotion bend? Guy. I have no garland, No fading sweets, no transitory pledge Of passion to confer. My wreath is form'd By links of plighted love, and truth that breathes A never dying fragrance!âPardon, brother! I speak my approbation of your choice, By humbly bending here.â [Bends on one knee to Alibech. Odm. How, Guyomar!â Does thy presumption overleap the bounds, That guard my rights of eldership? Guy. No, Odmarâ The kingdom, by priority of birth, Is thine, unenvied: eldership, my brother, Though a good plea in empire, never yet Was held a plea in love. Mont. 'Tis true, my children. Since you, unhappily, have fix'd your hearts On the same object, let her choice decide Your rights of rivalship. Alib. My heart, my lord, Is that of a cold virgin; though long woo'd, Not lightly won. Who serves his country best; Who e'er in council, or the field of danger, Shall vest his name with a peculiar lustre; To him I yield my person and my heartâ Not as a gift, but the reward of virtue. Mont. Greatly determin'd. Honourable maiden, Happy, as glorious, be thy fair election!â Orbellan, has thy garland been composed To wither in thine hand? Orbel. Not so, my liege, Might I assume the boldness to approach, Where the aspiring ardour of my love Would breath its incense! Mont. Love, Orbellan, is An arbitrary lord; nor will submit His rule to our direction. 'Tis enough, However high and dignified the object, To sue with reverence, and to hope with honour. Orbel. Suppose the daughter of my sovereign?â Mont. How!â O, I do seeâthe gods, in spight of victory, In spight of death, are bent to vindicate The empire of Traxalla; while his progeny, With galling retribution, cast their chains O'er me and mine! Alm. Proud monarch!âYet reflect, Who scorns the suit or person of my brother, Makes light of the displeasure of Almeria! Mont. I strive in vainâthe lion's struggling heart Is wound about with toils!âCyderia, take Thy lover's wreath; and, if thou dost esteem Thy father's welfare, treat him not unkindly. Cyder. Obedient to your pleasure, royal sir, Though much repugnant to my own, I take A pledge of love I never can returnâ Nature and deep disgust would therein prove, Too strong for your commands. Officer enters hastily. Offic. Break up your rites!â A host of foes, who lurk'd within the wood, Burst from their ambush, and enclose the temple. Mont. Make to the city, by the postern gate. Freedom, and conquest, or a glorious death, Best fits a soldier and a king! [Exeunt. Alarm without. They all re-enter as driven back by the enemy. Mont. Confusion!âon all sides beset!âHere, stand, And let us make this passage goodâIf not For victory, why, let us fight for vengeance! So shall our valour raise one trophy more, Even in the gate of death! Cortez without. Cort. Slaves, villains, cowards!âStay, restrain your outrage. SCENE V. Enter Cortez, Vasquez, Pizarro, Spaniards, and Traxallans. Cort. Did I not charge ye not to fight, on pain Of capital displeasure? Traxal. Dread commander! You know not whom you would protectâThese are Your first, your greatest foes; the very life Of Mexico, the vital heart and head Of twenty millionsâmighty Montezuma, Caught in our toils, with all his royal race! Permit us but to strike, and the wide world, Like fruit o'er-ripen'd, falls into your hand, Without the pain of plucking. Cort. Stay, I charge ye!â They shall not dieâmy clemency defends them. Vasquez, draw up our Spaniards, and give fire On all who dare to disobey. Traxal. O, mercy!â [Traxallans kneel. Mercy, dread sovereignâat your feet we fall For mercy!âSilence, then, your thundering gods!â If they but speak, we die!â Cort. Upon the instant, Withdrawâand hence be taught a due submission. [Traxallans retire. Mont. The fierce Traxallans lay their weapons down, And fearfully retire.âSome god presides, And shields us from destruction.â Patron of Mexico, great power of battles! [To Cortez. If you are he, whose nostrils take delight In carnage, and the scent of human blood Hot fuming from the heart, ten daily victims Shall gasp within your shrine.âBut, if you are, As rather it should seem, that deity, Whose sweetest incense is an act of goodness; The widow and the orphan, through our land, Shall tune their hearts to gladness; and our prisoners Spring from a thousand dungeons, to exult And gambol in your presence! Cort. Generous prince, Imperial Montezuma!âI am a man, To you, and many others, much inferior; Unless exalted by a soldier's worth, That to the sword of honour ties humanity. To you I come, ambassador of peace And friendship, from the world's most potent king, The mighty Charles of Spain. Mont. We know him not.â Yet, if we know ourself, we also know The world contains not one so greatânot him, Our brother of Peru, the second throne That rises o'er the earth!âThe rest are, all, Of order subaltern, or petty lords, And tributary vassals; as the Heavens Contain but two great lights, with lesser stars That form their regal train. Cort. Mistaken monarch! The world contains a multitude of empires; Within whose spacious tracts, thy Mexico Would shew but as a province. Full four moons Have watch'd our nightly courses, since we launch'd And left the nearest shore: all else, between, Is ocean; o'er whose bosom we have ply'd Both sail and oar, with unremitted speed, Through light and darkness. Mont. Wondrous are the things Thou tellest, as if Heaven had lately form'd A new invented world!âIn all events, If he, whose potent delegate thou art, Be great, and good, and gracious, as thyself; There's nothing more to fear. Say, first of mortals, What would thy monarch with a king and stranger? Cort. Vasquez, do thou unfold our high commission. [Addresses the Ladies. Vasq. Charles, by the gift of all-disposing Heaven, Chief monarch of the world, and king of kings, First wills that you resign your crown and scepter, To be return'd, and held, from him and his, By you and yours, in regal deputation, Even to the end of time. Mont. 'Tis in my handâ What if I hold it? Vasq. War and violence Shall wrest it from you. Mont. By what right? Vasq. The grant Of our great Pontiff; who, in Heaven and earth, Gives kingdoms, and resumes them. Mont. If he grants In Heaven, as now on earth, what is not his, We pity his expectantsâWould your king Aught further? Vasq. Yesâyour golden ore. Mont. 'Tis his. Though we refuse our kingdom to his pride, We yet bestow upon his poverty The treasures we despise!âIs there aught else, In which our new-found master would command us? Vasq. He, lastly, wills you to forsake your idols, Your worship of the works of human hands, And spirits reprobate; and to adore, With him, One Power Supreme. Mont. If he can shew us A god of just pre-eminence, whose power Wisdom directs, and goodness ministers, Our choice shall follow reasonâour own reason, Not that of others. Vasq. Pardon, royal sir! Herein you must be govern'd. We have brought you Instructors, deeply learn'd; all holy men, Commission'd, by infallibility, To root out error, and to plant the truth Of our unerring doctrine. Mont. Men, you say; And yet infallible?âO, I do see The threefold motives of your journey now! You, first, would plunder us of our possessions; You, next, would bend our bodies to your burdens; And, lastly, stretch the scope of your dominion Over our free-born mindsâIt is too much! You cannot hold us worthy of your friendship, Should we accept it upon terms so base, So utterly degrading! Cort. What's the contest?â Vasquez, I fear thou did'st exaggerate. What says the imperial power of Mexico? What says our royal friend? Mont. First, as a man, By your protecting virtue snatch'd so late From imminent destruction, much is due, And more would I return.âBut, as a king, Bound to defend an independent crown, And a free people, I reject all terms That favour of submission! Cort. Know, great sir, A new and powerful motive binds me, now, To court your friendship; and, howe'er compell'd, By the stern duties of my high commission, To stand in arms against your Mexicans, I cannot be the foe of Montezuma. Mont. Hear me, ye guardian gods of Mexico! If that, in Heaven or earth, a power is found To your's and mine superiorâIf some fate, Unknown, shall yet intrude upon our world, And cast us from dominionâmay that fate, With my friend's hand my ravish'd sceptre grace, And rule these realms in justice! [Exeunt all severally, except Cortez and Cyderia, who seems going, yet lingers behind. Cyd. My duty bids me goâand yet some power, More strong than duty, holds me! Cort. Fairest creature! Will you vouchsafe your presence, for a moment, That my fond eyes may gaze upon your beauties, Like to bewilder'd travellers on snow, Till they grow blinded with excess of brightness. Cyd. Fair stranger!âwhy I would stay here, I know not. Yet, somewhat keeps meâsome unknown emotion Stirs all my soul, and makes me sigh, and sigh, Altho' I feel no sorrow!âTell me, sir, What holds you, also, from your late associates? Cort. You do, bright excellence!âI am your captive; And you have bound me with a chain more strong Than links of triple steel. All other slaves May chance to break their fettersâI, alone, Can ne'er be free; for I am in love with bondage. Cyd. I wouldâI would, indeed, you were my prisoner! For I would bind you with a gentle thread; Nor ever put you into harder service, Than thus to look, and talk, and walk before meâ And yet I fear me, it is you have caused This new disturbance in my peaceful bosom, That thrills my blood, and heaves within my hearts, And pains me, sadly, when I think of parting! Cort. O, native honour, heavenly purity! That needs no veil, but shames the courtly mask Of practised guile, and studied affectation! To them Orbellan. Orb. Princess, your royal father sends for you, And wonders much at your delay. Cyd. Alas, So great a wonder for so short an absence! Orb. It is his strict commandment, that you come Upon the instantâ Cyd. Has he also sent To bring the stranger? Orb. Noâhis high placed love Rather demands correction. Cort. O, thou hast, Within the sacred presence of thy princess, A charter, wide as air, for insolence! Make use of her protectionâbut beware, When next we meet!â Cyd. Ah, I do feel, in parting, That I must leave my former joys behind; And carry nothing, in exchange, from hence, Save new found wretchedness. Cort. Where e'er you go, My sighs, my soul, and every faculty, Attend upon your steps. [Exeunt severally. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Cave. To the High Priest Montezuma enters. Mont. Hail, holy pontiff!âIt is not the fate Of doubtful war, the froward turns of fortune, The fall of kingdoms, or the change of states, I would alone exploreâI seek to know, What haply scarce the gods can tell, the springs, The secret turns and movements of the soul, A woman's soul!âO, give me to unfold The mystic volume of Almeria's mind, And let me read my fate! H. Priest. My powerful charms not dÃ¦mons shall withstand, And gods shall answer to my king's command. INCANTATION. I. Moon, pale regent of the night, Goddess of each magic riteâ In this dread and dreary hour, Aid us with thy light and power! II. O, ye stars, ye seeds of light, Radiant gems of gloomy night, In whose ever-varying round Present, past, and future's found; Who, in characters, comprize Falls of kingdoms, ere they rise, To our favour'd sight reveal, Whate'er, from vulgar eyes, with caution ye conceal! III. Ye spirits infernal, dark partners of woe! Ye dÃ¦mons who wield ebon sceptres below! Ye goblins and fairies, or dusky or fair, Who mine in the earth, or who dance in the air! IV. My wand demands ye, from hell, earth, and skiesâ Arise, arise, arise! A Terrestrial Spirit ascends. Spir. Prince, mourn your searchâyour gods are all controul'd; Silent, and bow'd before superior power! I dare no more. [Descends. H. Priest. Hence, dark and dastard spright!â Calib, my ever smiling friend! Circled with radiant light, descend; Our bosoms with thy wonted tidings cheer, Speak comfort to our heart, and music to our ear! Calib descends in white, and sings. Calib. I. Mighty emperor, attend; Heavy, heavy things impend! Many a conflict, many a fight, Desolation, fear, and flight, Loss of empire, life, and light, All rush upon my sight! II. Yet, thro' the horrors of this threatening sky, One radiant beam I spy. It comes, the singly smiling hour, That puts our Indian world again into thy power! III. They stand, they stand, Within thine hand, This horrid, hostile, ruthless bandâ Strike, strike, and save the land! [Ascends. Mont. Thanks, shining monitor!âIf I reject Thy counsel, let me perish! Empire is now assured: but what of love, What of Almeria? H. Priest. Ye spirits, o'er subtlest effluvia refined, Who feed upon thought, and reside within mind; Who mark, with a pleased unevadable eye, The swiftness of feminine whims, as they flyâ Be your Almeria's purpose shewn, Altho' to reason, rule, and right, and to herself unknown! The Indian Queen rises with a Dagger in her Breast. H. Priest. Ha!âwe call'd not for theeâ Hence, bloody spectre, visionary victim, Avaunt!âShe will not; and a sudden winter Freezes my blood! Mont. The gods, amidst the living and the dead, Could not have found another form, like that, To shake my soul! Ind. Queen. Ungrateful prince, your empty hopes resign; Almeria's charms will soon be cold as mine. Your course of empire, fame, and life, is run; And all shall set, before a second sunâ I wait you on the ghastly brink of death, To catch your spirit, and to drink your breath. For your dear love, I did my life forego; And thence I claim you in the realms below. The morning dawnsâI sicken at the view: A sudden meeting fits a short adieu! [Descends. Mont. Give me a narrower date!âye adverse powers, Finish your purposes! Why this dread knowledge Of what we cannot shun?âworse, than the worst That death can threaten, are the living pangs Of curs'd anticipation!â [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Grove between Mexico and the Spanish Army. Cyderia and Alibech. Cyder. Think you he'll come? Alib. Come, child?âhow young you are! How deep you under-rate your own perfections! You know not what a strength of pinion wings The lover to his love. Your message is As sure as fate had summon'd himâas happy As he were call'd to Heaven! Cyder. I would to Heaven It may be soâHis stay is wondrous long. Alib. Thou hasty innocent! although he rode The corner'd winds, they could not post him sooner. But, markâupon that rubied lip, Cyderia, The fate of Mexico depends! Do thou, Persuasive orator, with firmness plead Thy country's cause; and love shall soon subscribe The terms that beauty dictates.âSoft, he comes. SCENE III. To them Cortez and Vasquez attended. Cort. Cyderia here, dread powers! upon the brink Of danger and of death?âHaste, precious maid, Back to thy father's palace!âSoon this spot Shall all be cover'd, or be closed about With clashing armies, and with gasping squadrons, The dying and the dead!âHaste, royal maid! When kites and ravening hawks are on the wing, The white dove takes to cover! [Vasquez addresses Alibech in dumb shew. Cyder. Cortez, I think, they call thee. Cort. True, my mistress. Cyder. I love thee, manâI shame not to confess it; For I do think that thou art brave and honourable. Cort. Celestial purity!âwhere no spot is, No veil is wanting.âGoddess of my vows, Thus let me offer up a grateful heart, [Kisses her hand. Even on this holy altar!âCome, my love, I will myself convey thee to some place Of more assured protection. Cyder. Tell me, Spaniard, Is it, indeed, for me that thou art alarm'd?â Is it my danger that thou fearest? Cort. Heavens!â Is that a question?âTake this signet, soldier, Haste, bear my order through the ranks, that not A Spaniard, or Traxallan, move to action, Till this dear trust shall be disposed in safety! Cyder. Cortez, think not I bear these feathered shafts, And ebon bow, for ornament.â'Tis true, That when ambition, when the fire of blood, And martial ardour lead the soldier forth Upon some desperate enterprize; war, then, Is man's peculiar province.âLearn, however, That when we are assail'd, when hostile force Knocks at our gates, and overlooks our ramparts; Weakness gets strength, and cowards catch at valourâ Women and infants cluster to defend Our household fires, and guard our common country! Cort. Immortal powers! would my Cyderia soil Those virgin shafts with human blood? Cyder. Yes, Spaniard! In such a cause, even with thy bloodâthen, think not, I fear to shed my own!âBy yonder Sun, My radiant sire, I swear, if thou, this day, Shalt dare to offer battle, I will front thee; Nor cease to point my quiver at thy breast, Till some blest dart find entrance! Cort. You distract me! Are there no means, by which I may preserve Your precious life from danger, and myself From terrors worse than death? Cyder. Yes, generous Cortez! Bid thy bold troops draw offâthen, as a friend, Enter the gates of Mexico; and, next, Enter the heart and arms of thy Cyderia! Cort. Consummate virgin, most divine Cyderia! Daughter of truth and order, brighter far Than yonder Sun, whom you have deign'd to stile The father of your race!âwould you, indeed, Would you disgrace the leader whom you stoop To honour with your favour? Cyder. No, my soldier! Thou shalt be worship'd as a guardian god, Throughout our Indian world. Cort. Ah no, Cyderiaâ Did I stop here, I should alike be spurn'd, On either part, by Mexicans and Spaniards, For shrinking from the bright and kindling course Of never dying glory! Cyder. Glory? Spaniardâ What is this glory, which you would prefer To the salvation of a grateful world, And your Cyderia's love? Cort. Glory, my princess, Is that which kindles souls to great atchievments. It is the price of danger, toil, and bloodshed; It warms the winter's camp, and turns the flint To a down pillow for a soldier's head. It is a being in the breast of othersâ 'Tis the high prize, for which we die with pleasure; Since glory gives us to survive our fate, And rise to immortality! Cyder. Is glory then and immortality The price of evil actionsâthe reward Of rapes and massacres, of blood and burnings?â O glorious famine, glorious pestilence! You, like the Spaniard, can make grass to grow In cities, and give wasted kingdoms up To birds and beasts of prey! Cort. O, you have conquer'dâblasted be the laurels, That ever shall be planted on the woes And waste of humankind!âYet, think, my mistress; I act but by commission from my prince, And, though the deed should prove a crime in him, In me 'tis duty. Cyder. Duty, to do wrong! Who has a right to give it?âNo, my Cortez, Then, when you dropt like a descending god, And saved the royal house of Montezuma, Then you were truely glorious.âO, be still Our guardian deity!âMy grateful father Has regions of unknown extent; fair realms, Where you, my soldier, with your blest Cyderia, May reign in your own right. Cort. Resistless tempter! The cause is yoursâRetire, but for this day; Retire, my love!âTo-morrow, I do swear it, And all the morrows of my future life, Shall rise at your disposal. Cyder. Spaniard, no. This dayâI swear it tooâshall end my life, Or free my country! Cort. Vasquez, go; our wars Are ended!âbid our men draw off. SCENE IV. Pizarro enters. Pizar. Haste, general! Our troops call out, impatient for their leader, And claim the inspiring presence of their Cortez. Already is the fight begun.âOrbellan, Follow'd by hosts of shouting Mexicans, Falls like a tempest on our ranks, and all Is blood and uproar. Cort. Now, divine Cyderia, Would you now wish me to stand idle? Cyder. No. Thus charged, and by a rival, I resign This day to honourâbut, remember, Spaniard, Your future life belongs to love. Cort. To love, And to Cyderia, be all my days devoted, Till time can count no more [Exeunt Cortez and Vasquez, &amp;c. one way, Cyderia another. SCENE V. To Alibech enter Odmar and Guyomar. Odm. Now fairest daughter of the day, bright Alibech, Now, ere I rush into the thickest battle, Give me to know my doom!âThose lips can speak it, Surer than all yon armed host. Guy. I also, Trembling attend my sentence; as the criminal, At some tribunal, waits the doubtful word That shall decide on life or death. Alib. Brave princes! One of you is much dearer to his Alibech, Than light to some benighted traveller; Or life to him, who shivers on the brink Of mortal dissolution. Who he is, The dear one, that sits scepter'd at my heart, And lords it o'er my wishesâneither looks Nor words, that I am mistress of, shall utter! For once it shall be said, that worth alone Controul'd a woman's fancyâThe fond love Of one of ye, by all due right, is mine; Your country, by a dearer claim, demands The life of bothâwho serves that country best, Becomes my masterâPrinces, ye are summon'd! [Trumpets. Guy. My merit, death or conquest shall approve. Fall on! Odm. Fall on! Guy. For liberty! Odm. For love! [Exeunt Odmar and Guyomar one way, Alibech another. SCENE VI. Alarm to the Battle. Montezuma, Orbellan, and Mexicans enter. Mont. They fly, the apostate rebels, the Traxallans; Bold in base ambush, but, in open fight, Fearful as dear that scud along the lawn Before their hunter!âCharge, charge home, my friends; Confirm your conquest, Mexicans! I ask The bravest and the youngest but to follow, Where your old King shall lead! [Exeunt. SCENE VII. Cortez, Vasquez, Pizarro, and Spaniards enter. Cort. May curses catch them in their flight.âMay death, And wounds of foul dishonour, from behind, O'ertake the servile herd, these vile Traxallans! Is this their vaunted prowess, this the fruit Of their confederacy, their hate of Mexico, And promised efforts for atchieving freedom? Let them all perish!âBreathe awhile, my friends, My firm, tho' little band of faithful followersâ Thank Heaven, we are yet entire! Vas. See where, wide scatter'd o'er yon distant hill, The panting dastards run. Pizar. Great Montezuma, Active as youth, and eager as the hound That bears and breathes upon his prey, pursues And mixes with their flight. Cort. Haste, Vasquez, seize The fair occasionâtake our generous horse, Few as they are, and, while our numerous foes Are in confusion, charge them in the rearâ Pursue the fierce pursuers! [Exit Vasquez. Pizarro, let us range our little band Of brave Castilians in yon copse; and thence, While these triumphant Mexicans return Assured of fickle victory, we'll flank And pour our thunder on them!â [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. Odmar and Guyomar, from different sides. Guyomar and his few followers bleeding. Odm. Where hast thou been, young dastard?âIn a day Of such wide triumph, wherefore has my eye In vain sought Guyomar, amid our host Of conquering Mexicans? Guy. Forbear, my brother, Forbear to load a man already burden'd, With heavier imputation.âWe confess Our powers inferior to these men, or dÃ¦mons, With whom we dared the contest.âThese wounds shew The few that, of my generous friends, yet live, Were not quite idle.âSay, where is the King, Where is our father, Odmar? Odm. Flush'd with conquest, He drives the routed host of the Traxallans Over the plains of Mexico. Guy. Traxallans! Why spend his bootless fury on Traxallans? Our braver women were enough to quell Two armies of Traxallans. SCENE IX. Guns go off within. Montezuma, Orbellan, and Mexicans enter as retreating. Mont. All, all is lostâthe gods have arm'd our foes With their own thunders!âWhat the utmost force Of man can do, we fear notâbut when earth And Heaven combine against usâto retire, Is due submission! Orbel. We but hear a sound, And sink in death, for ever! Guy. Hark, they come!â Haste sir, and gain the town, while I remain To guard your rear, and chearfully return That life you gave me. [All retreat, except Guyomar. SCENE X. Enter Cortez, Vasquez, Pizarro, and Spaniards. Cort. Press forward, fellow soldiers, take advantage Of their new panic! Spare, yet spare the blood Of Montezuma's royal house!âSuccess And glory crown our armsâCome on! [Exeunt. As Cortez is going out, Guyomar advances and meets him. Guy. Hold, sirâyou pass no furtherâI propose To win a feather from you; or to grace My fall, ennobled by your hand. [Strikes at the helmet of Cortez, his sword breaks. Cort. Thou art my prisoner, Indian!âHad thy sword Been equal to thine arm, I had not lived To tell thee soâHa!âlet me look againâ Art thou not he, that desperate Mexican, Who singly dared, this day, to press upon us, Even in the face of thunder? Guy. Cortez, as I hopeâ Art thou? Cort. Yes, valiant youth. Guy. Bring me my chainsâfrom any other hand I should have blush'd beneath them. Cort. Whoe'er thou art, my soul claims kindred with thee!â May'st thou ne'er put ignobler fetters on, Than those that bind thee now!â [Embrace. Guy. My heart's great master!â Your bounty, generous leader, must not rob you Of the large ransom which you ought to claim Know, that the captive of your arms is son Of Montezuma. Cort. What, Cyderia's brother? Guy. Cyderia's second brother. Cort. Blest event! My dear, dear brother!âmay I dare to tell you I am the captive of your sister's beauties? Never, again, O, never may my Guyomar Come thus exposed to battle!âBe this helm The guardian of that precious headâthis corselet, [Dresses Guyomar in his Armour. Be it henceforth a fence of triple steel Before thy valiant heartâand may this sword, In that strong hand, be still assured of conquest!â Guy. More estimable are your gifts, my conqueror, Than all things, save the giver!âEase my heart, And teach me how to thank you! Cort. With your friendship! Let that o'erpay me.âGo, my Guyomar; Thus glorious in the spoils of Spain, return, And spare the many tears, that now, in Mexico, Bewail your death or bondage. Guy. O, my friend, My best loved brother, till we meet again, My heart is still your captive.â Cort. O, farewell! [Embrace, and go out severally. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Palace. Alibech and Cyderia enter in tears, Odmar following. Alib. Away, away!â Odm. You wrong me, by the gods!â What mortal force, or mortal courage could, I did, and dared.â Could I stand up against my brother's fate, Or, what is more, against his folly?âNo, He cast life from him, as it were a cup Of somewhat banefulâin a frenzy, rush'd Amid a host of his steel-coated foes, And perish'd. Alib. Yes, all glorious, peerless youth! His promise is accomplish'dââDeath, or conquest!â It was his parting sentence.âHence, thou vile one! Is it because the eyes of men, alone, Have seen thy back, that yet thou darest to face A woman? and, half breathless from thy flight, To wooe a daughter of the Sun? Odm. Yet, hear me. That very Sun, thine all-discerning sire, Will witness that I fled notâAs a tyger, Baited by hunters, I retired reluctant, My face still toward my foesâthe guardian shield Of routed Mexico, the very last Who entered at her gates! Alib. No more, no more. Thou never hadst a portion of my heart; Now, thou hast all my hatred!âWhere, where is he, My Guyomar, my lost, lost love?âHa, Odmar! Has not thine envy of superior worth, Leagued with these curs'd invaders, to unprop Thy tottering country? Odm. No, injurious princess! Your brother, had he look'd behind, had seen Odmar, the guardian of his rear.âYet, look To do me right!âYou are mine by compact, ladyâ Nay, more, by sure necessity; the world Affords you, now, no other choice!âIn spight Of froward affectation, you are mine; Nor is there power in earth, or higher Heaven, To wrest you from me, but with life! Alib. Thine, Odmar? Thine, sayst thou, and by compact?âNo, fond man! I was affianced to the bravestânot To him who sledâbut, to my Guyomar, Who stood, and fought, and fell, to save his country. Odm. Proud and insulting as you are, you shall not, You shall not hope to rob me of your beauties. That host, for whom I fought and bled this day, Shall yeild you to my arms, howe'er reluctant; The bride or victim of my love, I reck not! Alib. While there are daggers, poisons, lakes, or flames, I cannot fear to 'scape the arms of Odmar!â Stay, prince, and mark my final resolution. I am the wedded of thy brother's spirit; And, to my Guyomar, 'fore thee and Heaven, I plight my faith for ever!âHere I kneel, Vowing to keep my body from the stain Of mortal touch, save that of death; Till, born in brightness, on my father's beams, I shall be wafted to the blest abodes, Where love, and Guyomar, shall give new life, And fill up immortality! Odm. Proud maid! Then be it soâa hasty death, this day, Shall make thee Guyomar's; or life, to-morrow, Shall give thee all to Odmar! [Exit. Cyder. Ah, my sister! Why, with the stings of scorn, would you provoke A mind, by nature prone to gusts of passion? Alas, he is my only brother, now; Consider that, my Alibech; reflect He is the only brother that is left To your Cyderia! Alib. Save meâsee, Cyderia! He comes, all hero as he died!âhe comes, Sheath'd in celestial arms, to take me hence!â Nor waits the visit, which I had resolv'd To Heaven and Guyomar! SCENE II. Guyomar enters. Guy. My love, my Alibech!â Dost thou then fade, thou flower of Mexico? I catch thee, thus, e'er thou declinest! Alib. Thereâ Take meâtogetherâsoul and body, bothâ For both are thine!âBear me beyond the hillsâ To some strange world, where we may find, perhaps, A freer airâfor here are mistsâtoo thick For breathâall dark and stiflingâOh! [Faints. Guy. Cyderia, help!âAlas, she faints, she diesâ And I am scarce alive! Cyder. Do you live, indeed? Alib. Where am I now?âhow far upon our journey? Guy. You are in the arms of Guyomar, my love, Your own blest bower! Alib. Am I all spirit, now? Guy. Spirit and flesh, as I am, Alibech; But your's the fairest, purest, heavenliest, sure, That ever cased a mind! Alib. You, also, feel as though you had not, yet, Attain'd to immortality. Cyder. My brother! Shall not Cyderia, also, share the joy Of your return to life? Guy. My dearest sister! [Embraces. Alib. We heard, my Guyomar, that you were hewn To pieces, and that every Spaniard took A portion of the precious spoil. Cyder. Say, brother, What sword is this, that glitters at your side? This plumey helmet, and this blazing corselet? Are they the gift of some protecting god? Or are they, rather, some consummate workmanship Of this new world of Spaniards? Guy. These were, late, The armour of that boasted chief of Spain, The mighty CortezâHand to hand, we stood Opposed in mortal duelâ And, on his casque I hew'd, while my good sword Could hold its temper.âHa!âwhy pales the cheek Of my Cyderia?âSoftâI did but feignâ I did but feignâHe lives, my sweetest sister, Your Cortez lives, my girl! as true in love, As he in war is valiant! SCENE III. Odmar enters. Odm. What, Guyomar return'd? Guy. My brother Odmar! [Offers to embrace Odmar, who turns away. Why thus cold, my brother? Although in war, as love, you are my rival, You are yet a rival most belovedâI know You scorn'd to take advantage of my absence. I come, the faithful witness of your valour; And plead no better merit to our princess, Than that I dared, from Odmar's deeds, this day, To take my great example! Odm. Free, alive, Unhurt?âO'er-ruling powers, 'tis wondrous, all! SCENE IV. Montezuma, and Orbellan, attented by Mexican Chiefs. Mont. See that our walls be doubly lined around! And let our boats bear off the sick and maim'd, Infirm old age, and helpless infancy, Safe to the southern shore, that fronts the coast Where now our foes entrench. Sambello, Malech, See this perform'd!â [They prostrate themselves, rise, and go out. Guy. My father, and my King!â [Bends his knee. Mont. My Guyomar?âby my great sire, the Sun, The noblest gift that he could send!âMy child, [Embraces. Champion of Mexico, thy country's pride, Thy father's boast, his younger Montezuma! The gods, the gods be praised!â Guy. O, royal sir! O'erwhelm me not with honours much unmerited. I blush to say a son of Montezuma Was, this hour, captive to the arms of Spain, Even of that Cortez, whose protecting word Late saved the royal house of Mexico, From the insulting arms of false Traxallans. I am the second offering of his bounty; And, from his side, and head, and generous breast, He pluck'd these arms, and put them on his slave, To make the glory of your Guyomar Look bigger than his shame! SCENE V. Melmar enters, and falls prostrate. Mont. Your business?âRise. Melm. 'Tis for the private ear Of Montezuma, and the prince Orbellan. Mont. All else retire!â [The rest withdraw. Now speak. Melm. Most mighty sire, Let not misdeeming hate, or pride imperial, Reject the service which I come to offer. Bold be my words, but honest! Mont. Forwardâboldly. Melm. When the wide empire of the great Traxalla, Bow'd to the arms of greater Montezuma, Had he not ruled us with too straight a rein, We had not cast for freedom. Mont. Your full purposeâ Speak it. Melm. To quit the galling yoke of Mexico, We put on that of Spainâto scape the flood, We plunged into the flame! Orbel. If I mistake not, My friend, and kinsman, Melmar!âart thou not? Melm. Yes, my loved prince. Orbel. A valiant man, my liege! And chief of our Traxallans. Mont. He is welcome. Tell me, brave Melmar! I would gladly hear Somewhat of these new lords, our Spanish inmates. Melm. Crush them, ye falling Heavens! Earth, sink beneath them! Plague, famine, fire, consume them to their entrails, And hell hounds gnaw their bones!âThey are, they are, In lust, more rampant than a summer's fly; Lawless as winds, remorseless as the rocks, And, as the gulph of Mexico, devouring!â Then they are scornful, cruel, and insulting; As though our Indians were but pismires, placed For their proud foot to tread on! Mont. Wish ye not To change your masters? Melm. Therefore I am come. Say, sire, what terms Traxallans are to hope for, When they have joined their powers to those of Mexico, And scourged these pests back to the noisome fens, From whence they first arose? Mont. Be witness, Sun and Moon, and all ye lights That shed your comforts on our Indian world! The day that frees us from these Spanish dÃ¦mons, Who roll infernal thunders o'er our heads, Shall see Almeria on the throne of Mexico; And this, your native prince, your loved Orbellan, Upon the throne of his imperial parents, Traxalla and Acacis! Melm. 'Tis enough. Now mark meâNear the tent of their great Cortez, My squadrons quarterâsince our last engagement, He did me somewhat of disgraceâSuppose, Within this hour, I bring him to your presence, Indignant as a tyger in the toils, And tearing at his chains? Orbel. Your leave, my liege, I pray, to make a party in this enterprize, With a few gallant friends! Mont. The night's far spent, And casts a favouring cloak upon your daring. Glory, and all the gifts of Montezuma, Attend on your achievement! [Exeunt. SCENE VI. The Camp of the Spaniards. Cortez enters unarm'd, except his sword. Cort. Heavens, what a glorious canopy is spread, O'er unobserving silence!âhow the moon And wakeful planets dance their glittering maze, In ceaseless evolutions!âEarth is no more, From the creation to the last of things, The tomb of all its offspring!âWhat a scope Is here for human thought?â A Mexican enters. Mex. From Guyomarâ In haste, and breathless!âTreason is at handâ I dare no moreâtake warning!â [Exit. Cort. Treason!âwhence? All are at quiet in their nightly death Of sleep and silence.âHarkâwhat rustling's that? Stand!âCome no nearer. Orbellan enters suddenly, his sword drawn, and followed by Mexicans.âHe lays hold on Cortez.âCortez springs back, draws, and kills Orbellan at the first pass. Orbel. You are my prisoner. Silence; not a word! Cort. Deeds were, perhaps, as well! Melmar and Traxallans enter behind, and seize and bind Cortez. Melm. Bind, bind him, sure. Cort. Guards!âVasquez! Melm. But another wordâand this Shall silence you for ever!â [Offers a dagger to his breast. O, he is slain, Our prince is slain!âSoftâtake the body upâ Lead off your prisoner! [Exeunt. SCENE VII. The Palace. Almeria and Alibech. Alm. 'Tis sure, my sister, Some secret purpose is in agitation, Dark as the night!âThe sound of clustring feet Is all we hear; while crouds, succeeding crouds, Throng toward the western gate. Alib. Our brother too Is missing. O, the gods, the gods preserve The last male pillar of the ancient house Of great Traxalla! Alm. Listen!âHear you not The fife and golden ringer? Alib. Dismal soundâ It is the knell of death! [A Bier born by Traxallans, others follow trailing their Ensigns. Alm. Ah, friends! whom bear ye, With such a pomp of woe? Trax. Our prince, Orbellanâ Yet warm, and bleeding from the hand of Cortez. Alib. Unhappy brother!â Alm. O, the light, The light of our great father's royal house, Is now extinct for ever! Alib. Would to Heaven, Would I had died for thee, my brother!âI Had been well spared; or, haply, well away From bonds and foul dishonour! Alm. Fatal Mexico! Ill omen'd race of hostile Montezuma! Father and mother, and both brothers now, By you have fallenâHear me, gods and dÃ¦mons! [Kneels. This Montezuma, blast him!âLet him stand On the bleak heath, quite lopp'd of every branch That now adorns him!âSudden death engulph His offspring! that no future name may rise, To tell, by whom, our father's high built house Was dash'd to ruin! [Rises and follows the bier. SCENE VIII. Enter on one side Montezuma, Odmar, Nobles and Guards; on the other side Cortez in Chains, with Melmar, Mexicans, and Traxallans. Mont. Whence are those shouts?âHaste, soldier, learn the tidings. What, the redoubted thunderer in the toils? He, whose almighty breath, to our low world, Can dictate bonds or freedom, life or death, And change our gods and customs at his pleasure? Spaniard, thy power, like lightning from the west, Hath spent a sudden blaze, and now is vanish'd! Cort. Indian, there's not a link in these vile chains, But what shall be a mountain's weight, to whelm Thee, and thy Mexico! Mont. Thy voice still sounds As that of thunderâbut, we heed it not, 'Tis emptied of its bolt.âYet, noble Cortez, We do not yet forget we are thy debtors; And, as the man we love, thou shalt command us Much more than as the god we fear'd.âSpeak, Cortez; And, if the terms, thou wouldst enjoin, are such As may not sink us to a servile depth, Below the friendship of the man we honour; We ratify thy will. Cort. O, 'tis beneath the mighty Montezuma To chaffer with his slave. Mont. Yet, to that slave We give, with honour, more than we would yield To ten such iron-harnessed hosts, as those Which thou hast led against us. Cort. Off with thy crown; and prostrate at my feet, Sue thou for peace!âMy answer, haply, then, May not displease. Mont. Hence, with him, to the dungeon!â Ere morn, we may determine of his fate SCENE IX. Guyomar enters in haste. Guy. The friend of Montezuma's house in bondage? Shame, shame eternal!âO, my royal father! [Bends his knee. In haste, permit me to unbind the chains That hang so heavy on our honours! Mont. Hold, Rash boy!âthou know'st not with what insolence He spurns our condescensions. Guy. O, my father! He is noble; and great minds are known to rise, Proportion'd to the weight that presses them. Think, how he rescued you, your sons, and daughters, From death, or instant bondage and pollutionâ And me, a second time, his recent captive, The recent object of his grace and bounty! Perish all conquest that dishonour gains, That infamy must follow! Mont. Well, set him goingâlet him do his spight! We weigh our own reproach above his power, And that of his licentious band. SCENE X. As Guyomar unbinds Cortez, Almeria enters. Alm. Stayâwhat are ye about?âHe is my prisoner. Bind him, yet faster!âKnow you, Montezuma, This wretch is warm in my dear brother's blood, The last ill-fated son of great Traxalla? Mont. I know, fair princess, he was late the guardian, Even of Orbellan, and his beauteous sisters, When sudden ambush had foredoom'd us all To sure perdition. Alm. O, it is not that Which makes his merit in the baleful eye Of Montezuma. He is the butcher of Almeria's brother, Of the last rival of the line of Mexicoâ And thence derives his freedom. Guy. No, Almeria! He is enfranchised by the voice of benefits, That speak as loud as thunderâbenefits Conferr'd on us, on you! He stands protected By every Indian virtue, that takes sanction From faith or gratitude!âYour brother found The fate he look'd for. Alm. Hence, audacious boy! Or fear for thine own safetyâThus I offer him To justice, to revenge! [Draws a dagger. Mont. Hold yet, Almeria!â Why wouldst thou sink me underneath a heap Of foul ingratitude?âObserve me, Cortez! The world shan't sway me to ordain thy death; And love forbids me to appoint thy freedom. Odmar, take thou the charge, and hold him safe, Alike from friend and foe, from Guyomar And from AlmeriaâGods, conduct our ways! And honour light us through this puzzling maze! [Exeunt. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Almeria and Melmar enter. Alm. Yes, Melmar, I detest them both alike, Spaniards and MexicansâI would to Heaven, That neither side may sheath the ruthless sword; That fire and famine may, with mutual death, Consume them both, till Mexico and Spain Lie in one grave together! Melm. There spoke the godlike and impetuous spirit Of your great sire, Traxalla!âO, my mistress, That were a golden day!âto see you throned On the high seat of your imperial ancestors, And the exulting remnant of your subjects Bow'd down before you, pouring forth their thanks To you and Heaven, for freedom! Alm. This same Cortezâ But that he has embrued his murderous hands In my dear brother's bloodâI would, in spight To Montezuma, and his hated progeny, Give their great foe enlargement. Melm. O, beware, Beware of that, my princess!âCortez is Much more the friend of Montezuma's house, Than of Traxalla'sâHe traduces us As cowards, fugitives, traitors alike To Spain and Mexico. Alm. A poniard thank him! He lives not to behold another sun, If wiles, or threats, or golden promises, Can pass me through his guards!âMean space, good Melmar, Thou, and thy true Traxallans, at a distance, Watch well the avenues leading from the tower, Lest his young friend, industrious Guyomar, Should compass his escape. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. A Prison. Cortez in Chains. Guyomar enters with a sheathed sword in his hand. Guard. You pass not here, my lord. Guy. Give me way, friend; Behold your emperor's signet!âWhere's your prisoner? My friend, my brother!â [Runs and embraces Cortez. These hand were made for scepters, not for bondsâ Quick, let me loose them! Cort. Stay thee, Guyomar! Thou art a subject, and a son, young man; Thou must not, in a fit of private friendship, Cancel the duty of those dearer ties, That ought to bind thee to thy king and country. I prize not freedom at so high a cost, As the dishonour of my friend! Guy. O great, And glorious ever!âYes, I know it, Cortez, Well do I know, that, if the gods have doom'd The final ruin of our ancient empire, 'Tis that right hand, alone, that has the power To shake it from its base.âBut, O, the empire, Even of the world, were joyless, if obtain'd By mean ingratitudeâthe chains of him, Who granted life and freedom to his binders! Cort. No moreâthese manacles and I are friends, Till we can part on terms not quite inglorious. Guy. Think not that I am come without commission: I bear the royal mandate, even the seal Of grateful Montezuma, who consents To the enlargement of the only foe, Whom he has cause to fear. Cort. Then, let him come, And with his proper hand strike off my shackles. Guy. My brother, stand not, thus, upon punctilio. Your precious life's in peril! You have slain The last male hope of the imperial house Of fallen Traxalla; and the fierce Almeria Thirsts for your blood, as gaping fields for rain In summer's fervour.âHasteâmy fears and friendship Concur to force you hence!âThe night is dark, And helps to skreen you from her darker purpose. [Unbinds him. Cort. Beware!âRemember, I gage for no conditions, while I stand On hostile ground. Guy. Even as you lift, so be it! If peace, when next we meet, I'll greet you thusâ [Embraces. If war, I know where Cortez may be foundâ Even in the front of battle I will face him, And on his temper'd helmet prove the worth Of this his late donation! [Puts his hand on his sword. Cort. When you are fallen, I think I shall not fear another bar, In my high road to-conquest! Guy. Take your sword. Would that I were a tutor, fit to teach That right arm in its manage!âHither, soldier! Here is the signet of our emperorâ Conduct his friend, in secret, through the gate That opens on the camp.âBe faithful, thou, I shall not be forgetful!â Cort. Fare you well. [Exit with the Soldier. A Chief of Mexico enters disguised. Mex. Where is my prince, where's Guyomar? Guy. Who asks?â What, Adramelech, shrouded in the cloud Of a slave's habit?â Mex. Yes. This hook and cord Help'd me to scale our wall, and let me down, Where I surrender'd to the Spanish watch, As a deserter. I was straight convey'd To the proud tent, wherein their captains sate In midnight council.âTime cuts off my tale.â I gain'd their confidenceâthey rest assured Of sudden conquest; and, in riot, spend The short remainder of the night.âBe speedy! If we succeed, and seize them at their banquet, Yet, ere another hour shall pass, they enter The northern gate in chains!â Guy. O, hero, patriot, Mexico's first boast! [Embraces I have, yet, a band of friends, who will not fail us.â For glory let us hasteâfor country, kindred, For liberty, for virtue!â [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Streets of the City. Almeria enters attended, on one side; and Melmar with his Traxallans on the other. Alm. He is not in the towerâSpread several ways! He cannot yet be farâHis guard inform'd me He was this instant freed, by the command Of Montezuma, our arch foeâHaste, friends! We meet at the south angle. [Exeunt severally. SCENE IV. Cortez and his Guide enter. Cort. Why dost thou sculk, like some o'er-conscious felon, And shift me, meanly thus, from street to street?â Forwardâwhere thou wer't order'd! Guide. O, my lord, I doubt we are beset!âat every turn, I meet the faces of Traxallans; else, This signet had assured your safety. Cort. On!â Thou bear'st the seal of MexicoâI bear A signal to Traxallans. [Draws. Melmar and Traxallans enter. Melm. He is here. Surround and make him sure! Cort. Melmar, again? A single stroke may punish double treason! [Kills him. Melm. Curs'd Cortez!âQuick perdition swallow thee, With the two tyrant worlds, of ruthless Spain And Mexico!â [Dies. As Cortez kills Melmar, Almeria enters with Traxallans, who surround and seize Cortez. Alm. Secure himâthere!âTake up your slaughter'd chiefâ Shift for yourselves; and leave him to my vengeance! [Exeunt Traxallans with Melmar. With what audacious dignity he looks, What steady confidence!âbut I shall shake him. [Aside. Thou must die, Spaniard! Cort. I have heard no lessâ They tell me I am mortal. Alm. Ay, but Nowâ At this tremendous Now!âa sudden death, Unlook'd for, fearful!âThink, existence lost For ever!âHaply, worseâto plunge, at once, Amid strange beings, down unbottom'd steeps, Or gulph'd by smould'ring fires! Cort. I take my venture. Alm. This in an instant, then, decides thy doom For all futurity! [Offers to stab him. Cort. Strike!â Alm. Dost thou know, Wherefore I kill thee? Cort. Yes. I slew thy brother. Alm. Ah cruel!âWhy has Heaven, to that hard heart, Granted an aspect not inhuman?âTell me, What had my poor Traxallans done, to bring The wrath of Cortez on them? Were they not Thine allies? thy first friends? a hapless people, Who claim'd thy promised rescue from the yoke Of fell oppression? Cort. Therefore I commenced My war on Montezuma. Alm. Therefore, traitor! Why, then, assist to bring these evils on us?â Wast thou not told, how that inhuman tyrant Laid waste my country; caus'd my royal parents With their own hands, to free themselves from bonds, Ill-suited to their birth; in cold blood slew Traxalla's eldest hope, my valiant brother; And held three helpless orphans, the remains Of our lost house, as butchers cherish lambs Ordain'd to slaughter?âAnd does Cortez, too, Does their protector come, to crush the fallen, Who cried to him for succour?âO, 'twas cruel!â It was not soldierlyâit was not like The hero, or the man.âAlas, my brother, How art thou quench'd, sole light of lost Traxallans, Even by the ruthless hand that should have nourish'd And kept thy flame alive! Cort. Your dagger, hasteâ It cannot prove so keen as your reproaches! I swear I knew him notâhe came upon me, Like an assassin, in the night.âBut this Atones not my offence, or your affliction. Unhappy, injured fair one! by the worth, That weds a soldier's daring to humanity, My heart weeps blood in your behalf! Alm. I see itâ That starting tear has cancell'd half our quarrel! Say, what remains? Cort. To expiate the rest By my warm bloodâor by such deeds of duty, As call a soldier forth into the world, To succour innocence, to right the wrong'd, To be the champion of offended beauty, And war upon oppression! Alm. Wilt thou, Cortez? Cort. By the true honour of a christian soldier, If Heaven succeed my purpose, I will place The wrong'd Almeria on the golden throne Of her great ancestors. Alm. But wilt thou, Cortez, Instruct her how to govern? Cort. To my power, She shall command. Alm. A throne's a lonely seatâ And asks an abler hand than mine, to guide The restive reins of empire. Cort. Doubly blest, Beyond what empire can bestow, is he, Whom the first princess of the world shall stile The prince of her affections! Alm. Tell me, Spaniardâ Wouldst thou, indeed, believe him blest? Cort. Most happy, Above the lot of man! Alm. Suppose his name Were Cortez? Cort. O, you mock your servant, sureâ He, whom Almeria honours with her hand, Should have a heart to give! Alm. Ha, Spaniard!âSayst thou?â Where is that maid, whose more than mortal charms Have triumph'd o'er Almeria? Cort. First, and fairest! If love, and truth, and fealty, were, alone, To wait on the pre-eminence of beauty, All hearts were, then, Almeria's. Alm. Yes, I see itâ 'Tis as I have heardâthe tyrant's daughter, traitor! 'Tis with the hostile house of Montezuma, That thou dost seek allianceâtherefore fell My royal brother, to make copious way For his new rival in Cyderia's love! But mark me, Cortezâthere, thy hopes, ere morning, Shall be for ever blasted.âBy the powers That India worships, never shall the eyes Of that young sorceress open to behold Another sun!â Cort. If that thou dost but raze The whiteness of her skinâI, also, swear, Should fortune ever cast these shackles from me, To make a general tomb of thy dominions, And in it bury all thy father's house, And even the name and memory of Traxallans!â Alm. Go, mighty leader, execute thy threats, Upon the remnant of my wretched people!â Almeria breaks thy present bonds in sunder; [Unbinds him. And dares thee to the further breach of those Whereby thine honour binds thee! Cort. O, Almeria! Bright, royal, generous maid, excuse the warmth Of sudden passionâFairest of all creatures, Love is not in our willâbut gratitude, Friendship inviolate, and firm attachment, Are ever thine!âUpon my knee, I bend, To deprecate thy wrath!âO, spare her, spare That innocent! [Takes her hand. Should'st thou, and for my sakeâI swear, Almeria, I'll not survive her! Alm. That were somewhat worse, Than the entombing of my father's house, With the whole name and memory of Traxallans! Well, I will think upon it.âTell me, thenâ Wilt thou make trial, wilt thou do thy best, And love meâif thou canst? Cort. Yes, fair Almeriaâ Dear to my heart, and next to my Cyderia, I plight my duty here! [Kisses her hand] SCENE V. Cyderia enters. Cyder. Cortez!âand at the feet of proud Almeria!â Traitor, false Spaniard! Cort. Fly, thou lovely maid! Haste from this hostile groundâthy life's in danger, Thy precious life!âback to thy father's arms, From death, and from Almeria!â Cyder. Yes, I see, My coming was not in the season, Cortez. Faithless and baseâapostate, as thou art, To love and honour!âdid I not behold thee, Breathing thy vows upon the plighted hand Of my triumphant rival? Cort. O, I am trueâ Trust me Cyderia, I do love thee more Than cowards love their life.âAway, thou dear one! So thou art safe, suspicion matters notâ Time will unfold my truth. Alm. Can I bear this? Cyder. Yes, Spaniard, I will leave thee to the ties Of thy new trothmentâvowing, from this moment, Never to hear thee, but with ears of hatred; Never to see thee, but with eyes of horror! Falsest and most perfidious of mankind, Adieu for ever! [Going. Cort. O, my distracted heart!âYet stay, Cyderia!â Cruel Almeria, thou couldst witness for me, My truth, my faith inviolate! Alm. Yes, princess!â When thou didst see thy Cortez at my feet, He was a suppliant for Cyderia's life.â Vain was his suitâas vain as mine for love! And thus I answer to his scornâ [Draws the dagger suddenly, and rushes on Cyderia, Cortez catches her hand and disarms her. Cyder. Ah, she will kill me! Cort. Hold theeâtyger-hearted, Bloody Almeria!âFly this fury, love, Haste to the shelter of thy father's arms! He comesâI can no moreâAdieu!â [Exit Cortez. Alm. Princess, another day must end our strifeâ Decisive of no less than love and life! [Exit. SCENE VI. To Cyderia enter Montezuma, Odmar, and Alibech, attended by Mexican Nobles and Guards. Mont. He comes, the glory of our Indian world!â My son, my Guyomar, my hero comes, The champion, the deliverer of his country! Shouts, and sound of numerous instruments. Guyomar enters in triumph, followed by Mexican Officers. To them succeed the Spanish Officers and Soldiers in chains. The Mexicans range themselves on each side, while the Spaniards are led off. Then enter the Chief Priest, followed by a train of Priests and Priestesses. Guy. My King, my father! [Bends his knee. Mont. O, my honour'd child!â The weight of Heaven, in blessings, fall upon thee; For thou art worthy of its glory!âAlibech! Here, take thy soldier, recent from his toilsâ Beauty, like thine, can best reward them!â H. Priest. Begin your song of triumph and thanksgiving! SONG, By Priests and Priestesses. I. Thunder sleepsâthe storm is o'er; War and terror are no more. See their horrid hosts retireâ Fainting worlds again respire! By our conquering hero fell'd, Spain is shackled, force is quell'd! Peace revisits India's shoreâ Thunder sleepsâthe storm is o'er! CHORUS. Peace revisits, &amp;c.â II. Now, through every glen and glade, In the sunshine, in the shade, Vacant Innocence shall stray, Fearing neither wile nor way! Sons shall laugh within the shed, By their sires and grand-sires spread; Peace shall slumber, Toil shall snoreâ Wars and terrors are no more. CHORUS. Peace shall, &amp;c. III. In wedlock, again, loving pairs shall be tied, And children shall run by their glad father's side; Long poles shall be fix'd, where the minstrel shall sound, And where holy-day crowds shall dance chearly around; Birds shall chirp in the groves, and beasts frisk in the plain, Nor be scared by the thunders and lightnings of Spain. Through our clime, Mirth shall carol, and Laughter shall roar; For war, tumult, terror, and Spain are no more! CHORUS. Through our clime, &amp;c. [Priests and Priestesses go off in order, followed by a procession of Mexicans, laden with the spoils of the Spaniards and Traxallans. As they go off Montezuma speaks. Mont. Now to the temple lead our grand procession, Where to the gods, and Guyomar, be paid Our vows for safety!âthen, in lasting bands Of happy rites, and nuptial sanctitude, Be Valour join'd to BeautyâNor thou, Odmar, Grudge, to the worth of thy triumphant brother, This small, tho' lovely portion of the world, Which he hath saved for thee, my eldest born, Now thy sure heirship!âSound your instrumentsâ Let festal clarions rouze the slumbering night, And the long triumph hail the coming light!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Dungeon of Mexico. Odmar enters. Odm. They, yet, are scarce retired to rest, and Alibech May still be brought, a virgin, to the arms Of late despairing Odmar.âHa! what's this That checks my faltering stepsâand tells my soul, It is not right to loose these dogs of war Again to slaughter, ravishment, and burnings?â Whyâlet my favour'd brother look to that, The darling, the adopted of mankind For every blessing!âWhat's the world to Odmar, But a dark inauspicious foe, alike Detesting and detested?âHence, compunction! I will repay the wrong. [Knocks. Keeper. I ask not who you areâYou get no entrance. Odm. 'Tis I, 'tis Odmarâon a hasty errand, Express from Montezuma.âHere's his signet. Keep.

You are the foes of Mexico; but Mexico Is not the friend of Odmar. Vasq. Can it be? Odm. Yesâmy brother, the redoubted Guyomar, The boy, whose nightly treason caught ye all, As in one coveyâhe is, now, the sole Renown'd of Mexico, the one ordain'd To love and empire?âOdmar is an outcast!â And, hark!âfor you, the victims of his glory, Even now the bloody priesthood whet their knives, And deck their morning altars.

Shame on your dastard groans!âWhat would ye do For him, who should strike off your groveling chains, Snatch ye from sudden death, and give ye up To light and life, to worlds of endless gold, And everlasting glory? Vasq. Speak, commandâ We execute!â Odm. I claim no harsh conditions. First, for the imperial crowns of Mexico And of Traxalla, they are mine by right Of heritage and conquestâthese ye swear To confirm to me. All. We swear. Odm. Lastly, to save my aged father's life, And my young sister's honour. All. We swear! Odm.

A Chamber. Guyomar and Alibech. Guy. And art thou mine, at lastâand mine, indeed? Is the bliss realâdoes it mount to certainty? I swear it is too much, this height of happinessâ Higher than hope has ever dared to soar! But, whence, my love, this tremor of thy limbs? And, from thy cheek, why shrinks the backward rose Of summer's beauty? Alib. Ah, I know not, sweet!â A secret dread of some reverse at handâ A doubt that Alibech has not been born To be so blest!âWhile thus I touch, and see, And hold, and would believe thee all my own; Methinks some sudden arm arrests thine image, And leaves me desolate! Guy. Away, my angel, With this cold diffidenceâ [Knocking at the door. Ha, profane wretch!â Whoe'er thou art, that dares this rude intrusion, Thy life is forfeit!â Serv. O, it matters notâ Open, my lord, quickâopen! [Guyomar opens the door.âAttendants enter. Guy. What's the bustle? Serv. O, my dear lord, the Spaniard's loose againâ Unshakled and halloo'd upon the world; Even by that traitor to his house and country, Unnatural Odmar! Guy. Harkâwhat distant shouts, Mingled with horrid groanings! Serv. From this window You may behold where Mexico in flames, Prevents the coming day.âAll is blood and uproar, Rapine and ravishment! Guy. Haste, Azim, gather my few faithful followersâ Haste, my loved Azim! [Exit Azim. Bring me my arms!â [Attendants bring Helmet, Corselet, &amp;c. and lay his Sword down while he arms himself.

All, yet, may be recover'd. SCENE IV. As Guyomar is just armed, Odmar and Spanish Soldiers rush in suddenly, seize, and bind him. Odm. He's caught, in happy seasonâBind him sure, And sear no other arm!â'Tis well, my friendsâ Withdraw a while, and share the general plunder; I have a business to transact in private.

Hold, OdmarâGracious Heaven, 'tis she, herself, The goddess of my vows!âRuffian, forbear! Odm. How, Spaniard!âis thy tongue apostate, then, To its late language, that, with bended knee, All hail'd me India's monarch?âIs not this The single prize, for which I barter'd to thee King, country, kindred? Vasq. O, she is the prize, Which singly, in my mind, I held excepted From all the wealth of thy rich world. Odm. Avaunt!â And dread the swift-wing'd judgments that descend On perjury and treason! Vasq. Ha! on treason? Thou traitor manifold!âto father, friends, King, country, falseâto every sense, that puts Its seal on human nature!âand dost thou, Dost thou appeal to Heaven? Odm. If not to Heaven, I call up hell to vindicate!âNo more. 'Tis thus a monarch should chastise rebellion. Vasq. Thou hast thy merits! [They fight; and while they engage Alibech unbinds Guyomar.âOdmar falls. Odm. Perfidious Spain!âBlood thristing dogs of hell!â Open, thou gulph, and rid the world, at once, Of them and meâdownâdownâfor everâOh!â [Dies. Vasq. Now, daughter of the Sun, but brighter far, Than thy all chearing sire!âthou art my purchase. Guy. Stay, Vasquez!âthou hast yet a mightier arm, To mate withâand yet, mightier than that arm, A causeâI am her husband. Vasq. I dissolve The union.âThis is thy divorce!â [Advancing. Guy. Breathe, Spaniardâ I would not take thee at advantage. Vasq. Now, I do begin to fearâfor thou art honourable! In any other cause, I should prefer Thy friendship to thy sword!âCome on! Guy. If thou art less than thy great leaderâthis, Alone, may serve to fell thee [Vasquez falls. Vasq. Oâthy hand!â If, as I deem, 'tis that of Guyomar, I fall with honour!âart thou? Guy. Yes.â Vasq. Thy pardon! Guy. I would to Heaven I could, with equal willingness, Give life, and length of days! Vasq. O, no, no, no! That dream is overâof immense desires, That swallow earth and mainâof minim man, Who trusts, within his grasp, to hold a world, And finds it, nothingâO, farewell!â [Dies. Guy. Farewell, brave Spaniard!âTake their bodies hence. [Servants carry out the bodies. My faithful Mexicans approachâCome, love, [Azim and Mexicans appear. Let me bestow thee in some place of safetyâ Then fly, to shield my father's reverend head; To save the living, or to join the dead!â [Exeunt. SCENE VI. The Inside of the Palace. A Throne far back. Two Chairs of State brought forward. Almeria enters with a dart in her breast, and a dagger in her hand, supported by her women. Cyderia follows, weeping, brought in by two Traxallans. Wom. Send for physicians. Alm. No, 'tis past the power Of mortal medicineâthe envenom'd shaft Has reach'd my vitals; and my last of life Must follow its extraction!âThereâOhâgentlyâ Set me down gentlyâSoâ Wom. Alas, my mistress! What bloody hand has done this deed? Alm. I know not whence it came, from friend or foeâ For, as I fled across the palace court, This random arrow struck me.âWhere's my victim? Hereâbring her forwardânearer!â Cyder. O, Almeria! [Kneels. Bright, royal, generous maid, have pity on meâ Pity my youth, my innocence, and weakness! Pity is native to our gentler sex; And gentleness, with every soft perfection, Shew loveliest in Almeria! Alm. Peace, thou sorceress!â Yet closerâbring her.â Cyder. Ah, if all my blood Could stop the flow of thineâtrust me, Almeria, I should the readier yield itâWhat's my trespass? Alm. Not oneâbut two, and both unpardonableâ Thy beauty, and thy blood!âThou art of the race That robb'd me of my kingdomâthou, thyself, Hast robb'd me of my love!âAnd shall the house Of Montezuma triumph, and grow strong Upon the ruins of Traxalla's?âNo. Die, thouâand let the living of thy race, Learn, in their turn, to weep!â [Lifts the dagger. Cyder. Stay, yet, a moment!â I have wept for them, Heaven doth know I have; Night after night, with tears, have mourn'd the fate Of your unhappy royal house! Alm. But, then, To live and revel in Almeria's spoils, While I am lost, alike, to love and empireâ It must not be! Now, while I yet have strength to strike!âNay, shrink notâ Wherever dark futurity ordains, We go together! Cyder. O, the gods, he comes!â He's hereâand shall I perish in his sight? Sink in the harbourâand without a struggle For lifeâfor love? [As Almeria attempts to strike, Cyderia rises, catches at her arm, and, in the struggle, wrests the dagger from her, and throws it away. Alm. AlasâI am too faint! SCENE VI. Cortez enters attended. The two Traxallans turn and fly. Cort. My angel, my Cyderia!â [Runs and embraces. Cyder. Hold me, fast! Sayâdo I live, do I yet breathe? Cort. Yes, dearest! I have thee, once again; nor shall the world E'er part us moreâHa! what is here?âAlmeria, All pale and bleeding! Alm. Yes, triumphant Spaniard! Thou hast thy wishâand, thus, I pour my blood, [Draws the arrow. The last of an unhappy life, To fate and Cortez!â Cort. Ah, supportâShe's going!â I wish thy death, Almeria?âHeaven is witness, To save thy life, how gladly, grateful Cortez Would risque his own! Alm. Thine arm!âCyderia's too!â Fear not, I am past the power to hurtâSweet maid, Thou art safeâthank Heaven!âthy pity, and thy pardon! I ask it with my dying breath!âAh, Cortez, Thou art with death familiarâdost thou know, What 'tis to draw the bloodâto drain the breathâ To shut out light, and dwell in chapless vaults, Sister'd with night and everlasting silence?â O fearfulânot to be!âMore fearful, yetâ To live to wretchednessâperhaps, for ever!â I goâto tryâif we may meetâagainâ I shall be fraught with tidingsâstrange toâOhâ [Dies. Cort. She is at peaceâTurn thee from death, Cyderia! [Beckons to the Attendants who carry out Almeria. Where is the King, my love, where is thy father? Cyder. Alas, I know not. Cort. Alvarez hasteâthou hast a human heart! Restrain the fury of our savage countrymen, Who range, like tygers, loosed from bonds; unsparing Of sex, or infancy, or helpless ageâ Haste, good Alvarez! [Exit Alvarez. Retire, Cyderia!âAh, here comes a sight, To make thee think, that blindness were a blessing! SCENE VII. Enter Montezuma supported behind by two Mexicans, and by Guyomar and Alibech on either hand. Mont. O, my kind children!â'tis too muchâthis goodnessâ I shall oppress you with my weightâAlas!â My limbsâall rent from their enfeebled burdenâ Refuse to bear its bulkâThereâseat me downâ Never to rise!âHow blest the deadâif deathâ Is free from pangs, like these!â Cyder. Alas, my father! Cort. Doubly accursed be the hands that did This horrid deed! [Cyderia and Cortez kneel to Montezuma. Mont. Awayânor blast my sight With the detested aspect of a Spaniard! [Cortez rises. Guy. O, Cortez, blame him notâthere's cause, there's cause, For hatred, never to be reconciled, 'Twixt Spain and Mexico!âI found him hemm'd, Bound, and insulted, by a band of ruffians; His aged limbs, all strain'd upon the rack Until they crack'd the cordage! Cort. By the power Whom the world ought to worship, they survive No longer, than my vengeful arm shall reach To hurl them to the fiends!â Guy. Their doom is seal'd. Pizzarro, as I think, they call'd their chiefâ With the one stroke of this thine honest sword, I gave his head to leap, three javelins length, From off his shoulders! Mont. Do me justice, boy!â Say, did I, meanly, sue to them for mercy? Did I degrade the majesty of kingsâ Or bend, in vile compliance, to the terms They wanted to extort? Guy. O, no, my father!â You bore yourself above mortality; And your fell torturers raged to find themselves Defeated of your groans! Mont. O, my dear children! Nature felt inward, stillâand is the same, When circled by a crown, as in the cottage.â Oâthey returnâmy painsâsure harbingers Of final dissolution!âNow, againâ Now they extend me on the rack!âthey stretch The leaping arteries, and the quivering members!â Cort. Support himâhelp!âhis pangs are strong upon him. [Cortez and Guyomar support him, while Cyderia and Alibech kneel weeping on either hand, Cyder. O, my lost father! Guy. O, the falling pillar, Of our now desolated world! Mont. My childrenâ Bear with me!âOâfain, fain would I supportâ As a king oughtâthese throesâthis horrid cracking Of the heart's cordage!âNature sinks beneath The ruins of her pile.âO, for a soul Of independence on this rending frame Of mortal structure!â'Twill not beâexistenceâ Cannot bear up against the tumbling crashâ Of its own being!âOhâI am easier nowâ What a sweet Heaven this relaxation brings From tortures inexpressible!â'Tis pastâ The storm of nature's laidâand allâto comeâ Is calmâis quiet.â [Dies. Alib. O, he is dead! Cyder. He's goneâhe's goneâfor ever! And I, most wretched, left to wear the night With endless tears, and rise, each cheerless morn, A desolated orphan!â Guy. Down with thy towers, thou once exalted Mexico! Crumble thy spires and palaces to dust! Never be music, or the voice of joy, Heard in thee!âThrough the waste of thine high ways May all who meet, behold in either face The seal of wretchedness; and every ear Hear sounds of sorrow, and the clank of bondage! Fly, ye surviving innocents! to climes Far distant from invasionâleave your mansions, Your once endearing homes, to the possession Of bats and birds of night, of Spanish vultures, And beasts of depredation! Cort. Thy wrongs are great, my friend, thy sorrows justâ I feel and share them all! Yet, cruelty Is not the growth of Spain aloneâMexico, Even thy own Mexico, produces Odmars. Chear you, my Guyomar!âchear, my Cyderia!â Youth must succeed to age, and life to death; 'Tis nature's processâCome, ascend the throne Of your great ancestors, and rule a people Blest by your worth, and guarded by your valour! Guy. No, Cortez, generous chief, thou sole exception To an inhuman race of men!âdo thou And thy Cyderia grace the throneâI list not To rule o'er wretchedness; nor to be versed In sciences that teach us to destroy, And arts that serve to vitiate and corrupt The honesty of nature.âFar from hence I, with my willing exiles, will retire; While my loved Alibech shall light our way, And bless our steps with beautyâthere, nor gems, Nor gold, nor silver, shall excite the lust Of fell invasion; nor insatiate Spain E'er come, in search of poverty!âKnow, Cortez, Where wants are few, a little will suffice To furnish nature; and a light content Shall make it luxury!âThe fearless sports Of social Innocence shall chear our heathsâ Beauty and Love shall crown each peaceful night, And morning wake to Liberty and Light!</field>
