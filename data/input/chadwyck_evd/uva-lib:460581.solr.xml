      <field name="fulltext">THE FERRYMAN, OR THE TRANSLATED ESCUTCHEON. A Drama in Five Acts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Count of Altheim and Schwannenstadt. Otho Jucold, kinsman and dependant of the Count. Belthazar Netherstein, a wealthy Miller. Colen, the Ferryman. Tycho Thollpinne, assistant Ferryman. Mark Menno, Courier to the Countess, with other Servants. Countess of Altheim, heiress of Rabensberg. Rachel, widow of the Baron Von Knipperbrock, and now wife of Netherstein. Catherine, her daughter by the late Baron.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene on the Danube; a Ferry between Passau and Linz, with a large house and corn mill; the habitable part occupied by Netherstein; the rest consisting of granaries and other similar buildings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. A Hall, the walls of which are covered with nets, boat-hooks, eel-spears, dog-couples, saddles, match-locks, morris-spikes, bows, crossbows, stags' horns, and various other implements of war and sport. Netherstein and Ferryman. NETHERSTEIN. The quarter's ferry-rent is paid in labour: I shall be found a debtor if we square— Put up thy purse. FERRYMAN. We reckon ere we part. NETHERSTEIN. I will not touch a thaler. Thou didst hinge The tallet shutters for me, stale the gaun, New cauk the cistern, pay the barges wherry, Find floats and lead-lines for the smallest trammel, Lift eight score bean-sacks to the windlass hook, And break the roan-mare's filly. Fare-thee-well! We might have housed together yet, and I Have had thee here at hand to see me buried: But pride confounds us all with lust of greatness! How couldst thou lift thine eyes so high as Kate? That little crescent born of two such orbs? The daughter of the man that went before me? Last light of Knipperbrock? If mine she were, No more than mine, a pullet from some hen Befitting such a dunghill, thou hadst steered Thy wherry free of rent, and from my mealsack Hadst baked thy batch—we had not parted thus. No sight so comely as a cheerful face; Thine never came amiss to me. FERRYMAN. It could Outstare ill-chance before we met, Belthazar— And shall do so again. NETHERSTEIN. Ill-chance may like it, As sweeter-tempered maids, with Kate, have done, And change to good, by staring at its staring: If so, I pray come back again. There is In all this house but one that loves thee not. FERRYMAN. That one has got its cipher hitched behind it— Scores like a baker's dozen, one to spare— Is oddly even with us both, good master. Let us truck honestly, take turns in answering, And thou begin as ablest. If indeed All cheerfull faces seem thus pleasant to thee, How chanced that one which frowns me out of doors To thrall and overpower thee so! Pride was it? Through lust of greatness that thine eyes endured To gaze upon the firmament and covet Nor star nor crescent, but the moon at full? Kate is but as a spark from such a beacon. I crave the daughter of Von Knipperbrock, Thou hast his wife. NETHERSTEIN. Take warning from my beacon! The moon which ruled our almanac has waned. At first she shone benignantly above me— Would make me thrive! Ambition plucked me on, While pity pushed me. I too must be great; Get arms to quarter with, and not a florin! So was I overcome. FERRYMAN. She brings thee honor, And thinks upon her promises? NETHERSTEIN. I do, Being greater than I thought to be, or cared for. My house at least is nobler. In a week She nailed her husband's shield above my door— Her elder husband's scutcheon over head— The moon of Knipperbrock:—where once a year I paint and gild it to my cost and honor. Twelve times it has shone brighter than at first. The ghost from whom I had it deals by barter: I find his wife and daughter things to eat, With all their garniture—and he finds me The equivalent in moonshine—Let it blow! (Storm heard without.) To wish such storms in harvest is a sin— And yet fair weather which will part us twain Seems foully out of season. We shall miss Thee and thy song ere Christmas pass us, Colen! The fire burnt brisker when thy bench stood near; And bed-time ever seemed too soon, though Grace Winked and put back the clock. FERRYMAN. I may by then Lack stool and fire—I must such willing listeners. The rain falls heavily. NETHERSTEIN. None can cross to day. Thunder! hush! peace now! FERRYMAN. 'Twas but wind. NETHERSTEIN. Wouldst know How chanced my seat upon the crupper thus? That raw-backed hackney, wedlock, shook me there, Shifting the pillion foremost. Do thou leave A legacy behind to ease our parting. Thou hast some witch's wallet, sieve, and shears, A twin-child's caul, or such-like. Nothing harms thee: Ill-luck is ever near thee, but o'erruled. 'Twere easier sink a cork. Thou camest among us A soldier, with thy calling marked in front; War's own hand-writing scarcely yet effaced— Disbanded, pensionless, yet blithe as May. Wouldst help the Ferryman, then rent the Ferry: Row, run, or ride—no matter what or whither. The rich man's toll was alms for Lazarus: Thy bottle and thy wheaten cake were changed For fasting thanks, and often none at all. FERRYMAN. But now thy moon has blasted me. NETHERSTEIN. Hissed out, Like cobler's cat from next door madam's kitten, Hard hands are clapped at thee. Thou must be quick, To save thine ears. Friendless and poor as ever, Yet sometimes prouder than a Paladine, And kingly still above distressful thoughts. Teach me to hold such subjects under me. Mine have been ruled these three years by thine aid, But will rebel again when thou art gone. FERRYMAN. My crown stood on my head when I was born: Nature bestowed the sceptre. I have kept them— By sweeping dust from conscience ere it stick— Enduring and forgiving—so far stainless. Peace comes not down from hoppers filled with malice. Your grist when ground is mainly as your sample: The finest boulter cannot change the grain: Yet may we sift and cleanse it. On the stream I ruled my sail as wisely as I could; The wind which blew upon it was from heaven. NETHERSTEIN. Lo, here comes Kate; with tears upon her cheek! I will not mar thy kisses. [Exit Netherstein. Enter Catherine. FERRYMAN. What has grieved thee? CATHERINE. The dove-cot's weather-vane is blown away. FERRYMAN. Who says it is? CATHERINE. Grace Geert, and Minna Been. FERRYMAN. And Catherine weeps because it is? Ah me! I may not tarry till we find and fix it; Being blown away myself. CATHERINE. I will not grieve For that, nor one as fickle—who would shew me How light a thing it is to say farewell. FERRYMAN. Dost speak believingly? CATHERINE. I must—what else Is left me to believe? FERRYMAN. Even that I love thee, And therefore would not profit by thy tears; Buy pearls like these with drops no more than water. Nor traffic in exchange of promises. Nor mark the vantage ground for leaping back. Already it is a sin to stand so square Between thy faith and fortune, gentle Kate— Thy faith, though perfect in its right to change. Thou shalt be free as breath from babes asleep: And I no more a knave than love has made me— For love will lie to hope, and hire her aid, With proffers large as possibility. One year remember me. CATHERINE. But one? FERRYMAN. In less I may be dead or poorer still than now By all on this side nothing. CATHERINE. One, I pledge thee— To faith and love I promise all the rest. I am not wise, like Colen, nor could fix The time when love has leave to change or cease— License forgetfulness on this day twelvemonths: Nor will release him while I live, nor after. Think me a child or fool,—for so I am— Deride, but love me. FERRYMAN. Thou art truly wise; For truth is wisdom: yet a child in heart. I have lived longer by ten years. CATHERINE. And learnt That love may change? FERRYMAN. Ay, truly—to my cost; And haply to my profit also, Catherine. It may, or else I had not loved thee now. Twice we may love, at least, with space between. CATHERINE. How much of it? FERRYMAN. Apprenticeship to grief: Seven years for constancy. I thought as thou At brave eighteen—and thou at eight-and-twenty Mayst think as I do. CATHERINE. Thou canst love, not trust! I can do both, and ask no recompense, But love enough to wait till faith may earn it. It is my peace to know that thou art good. I would not hear this seven years' grief. FERRYMAN. Nay, three Were short and merry too, since I came hither In search of such chance bread as soldiers eat, When strife affords them none. My road was all ways. My riches not too heavy for my back. This roomy world sufficed for choice of dwellings. I helped a feebler Ferryman at first— And so got anchorage here. How love has thriven We better know than when he first began. At last he turns me out. There is no hope The while I bide, nor peace till I am gone. To see and hear thee baited for my sake, In worse than absence will be. CATHERINE. Tarry a week. FERRYMAN. By days and weeks I tarry months too long. The same that takes mine office, brings his boat And steers me back his passenger. CATHERINE. To-day? Dost think that he will come for thee to-day? FERRYMAN. The wind is with him, but too much by half— Go hence he cannot till it change. There is Enough time left in which to beg a keepsake. CATHERINE. What shall I give? FERRYMAN. A ringlet from those temples. CATHERINE. By the year's end it will escape thy keeping: Be dropped a hair a day—so waste to nothing, And leave me ill-remembered. Thou shalt take What hitherto has lain so near my heart, That if truth faltered, or love were not honest, I had not dared to keep it there. It is Faith's holiest symbol. (gives a cross.) FERRYMAN. Nay, a tress instead: I have no gold to change with thee. CATHERINE. I see A ring by much too small for such a hand. FERRYMAN. Such baubles shame their bearers. I have thought To cast it where the Danube runs the deepest: But still have worn it—more in scorn than favor— The sign of faith perverted. CATHERINE. Let me have it— I will restore it to its grace again. (While she struggles for the ring, enter Rachel Von Knipperbrock.) RACHEL. What talk was that of grace and modesty? Let me be profited! They say that blushes Are maiden warranties for both of them. Your servant, gracious mistress! Paw with paupers! Thou couldst do this without a blush—art blushing That it was seen in doing? Signs of grace Which show themselves so late are after welcome. I kiss your hands—good-morrow—with my courtesy!— What wouldst thou have, knave, here? FERRYMAN. A blessing, mother-in-law. RACHEL. Hussy, be gone. (Exit Catherine.) FERRYMAN. She weeps. RACHEL. Thou shalt weep too, Behind the whipping post, with greater reason. He claims thee from me, as his son-in-law, By many ancient marks upon thy back: And he shall have thee, presently. FERRYMAN. Sit down. By Saint Bride's hose, I will not budge a rood Without my stipulations—nor shalt thou. There must be treaties with me ere I go— Sit on thy throne, Semiramis. RACHEL. Ah! what? Semiramis! stand off! wouldst murder me! Out with him to the river, Melchior Tauss! Call me a dog? Sirrah, let go! art drunk? FERRYMAN. There shall be contracts sworn to by your highness. A league I will make with you. Twixt us twain Affiance there shall be and lasting love. Woe! woe! befal the breach of it! RACHEL. Love thee! Ah! hound's face! Clubs, Belthazar Netherstein— House! help! bring clubs, for pity sake! run! run! Out, Satan! what wouldst have of me? art mad? FERRYMAN. The wind outroars thee—none can help or hear thee. These gusty water-splashes choke thy piping. Therefore sit down and harken to me. RACHEL. Well— Let loose! thou wouldst not harm me? what dost crave? FERRYMAN. A peaceful covenant. These thirty moons I have paid tax and toll to please your highness: Now must I quit. RACHEL. So, get thee gone—good-bye! All peace go with thee! FERRYMAN. Some of it, I hope: I would leave some behind me. There remains A prisoner in thy wardenship. One hand She gives to each of us. If I forego, Thou shalt forbear? RACHEL. I shall? who says I shall? I purposed this, indeed, without constraint; But who shall bind me? FERRYMAN. I, the ferryman— By mightiest adjurations—all things good— And all things evil! By thine hopes while here, Thine health hereafter. By this watery world Of stranded barges, causeways, mill-fleams, ferries; And that serener change which is to come. By all the lore of faith and courtesy— Love, honor, gentle breeding, what thou art, And hast been heretofore of fair and noble, Ere purest meal was intermixed with bran. By every knightly knee which pressed the stones Beneath the lattice of thy maiden chamber— The minstrel's attestation—herald's oath— Thy daughter's blood—her father's chivalry— The moon eclipsed of ancient Knipperbrock— Remorse, compassion, magnanimity,— Thy troth, thy womanhood— RACHEL. Stop! stop! good sooth This charm has put me out of breath—swear what? FERRYMAN. To keep within the confines of thy state, And rule with sovereign potency, not terror. Thou shalt not break nor bruise—thou shalt not stretch The sceptre, as a rod, against thy child— Spit proverbs at her, twist thy lips awry, And vex her soul with scorn of Ferrymen. This thou shalt swear to me. RACHEL. If I do not? What power hast thou above me? FERRYMAN. Be advised, Thou widowed Dian! look! I give thee time— Hast answered that thou wilt not? RACHEL. Ay—I have. FERRYMAN. We dwell together, then: my boat moors here— Thou hast absolved me of my promises. Henceforth my habitation is provided. I will be nearer than I yet have been. RACHEL. Nearer to whom?—to me?— FERRYMAN. The while I live, And peradventure after if I can. At morn my face shall meet thee on the stairs— At night its tears shall wake thee from thy pillow— Within the hall at meat, the pew at prayer; At home, at church, at market, fronting, following, 'Twixt forsail and the gib upon the river— And in the waggon 'twixt the tilt and thripple— Lock fast the closet door 'gainst Minna Been, But still amongst the bottles—look to find it. RACHEL. More likely than at church. I scorn thy face— I do abhor thy face—alive or dead I fain would rid the house of it. FERRYMAN. Thou mayest. RACHEL. How, Beelzebub? what wouldst thou? FERRYMAN. What I say. RACHEL. Wilt keep it out of sight if I do promise? My sight and daughter's sight? FERRYMAN. Thou shalt not see it Till thou desire it. RACHEL. Get thee gone, at once. This covenant will last a thousand years. Take thy face hence, then. FERRYMAN. Are we sworn? The faith Of Knipperbrock is pledged to me? Henceforth Thou shalt use gentleness? If either fail The other is free? RACHEL. So—hang thyself—I promise. But, prithee, choose a gallows out of sight— Even there I would not see thy face—or seeing Desire to change its biding place. How now? What thing is this? (Enter Netherstein with Mark Menno.) NETHERSTEIN. A tail which takes precèdence. A trumpet from the puppet show—a courier, To Punch, I hope. Abase that feather, sir. Down cap and all its plumery—off with it! Let the comb under cool awhile. Behold The widow of Von Knipperbrock—my Lady! Who doth rule all things here beneath the moon. This other is the Ferryman as yet: He knows his craft—ask him. FERRYMAN. Prithee, make haste! My right of office hangs upon the air— Long questions might survive it. What wouldst have? MARK MENNO. A cup of wine, a corner near the fire, And what, by chance, may come to light hereafter When the pot's lid is lifted. These for me. My mistress craves a passage 'cross the ferry— Some farther hope of drowning. FERRYMAN. Thou shalt take My cup, my corner, and my chance at dinner: Thy lady goes with me. MENNO. She will do so. A benediction on thy love! I change, For three good things, but one. FERRYMAN. All these are gratis— Thrown into boot. NETHERSTEIN. He yields thee meal for gurgeons— My mistress for thy mistress. Bless the light Which shines above thee, and look up! MENNO. It seems A larded yarn-wick matched against a star, The brightest of the firmament. No matter;— I take it for its uses nevertheless. A candle is as handy as a comet. So stir thyself, good mistress. RACHEL. Thou wilt eat No dinner here to day—and if elsewhere It will be after supper time, good master. NETHERSTEIN. Thy lips have closed the passage to thy belly. MENNO. I did but speak by figures. FERRYMAN. Thou hast made Thy reckoning wrong, and cast the sum against thee. What star is this which can out-shine our moon? Her name and thine? MENNO. Aquarius, sir, am I, Your water-sodden servant. Here she is. (Pointing to the window.) Jove's brightest daughter answers thee herself. Wilt launch the ferry-boat? RACHEL. Whose daughter is she? Horsemen before the coach, and more behind! (Looking out.) Who is she, did he say? NETHERSTEIN. Whoe'er she be, She needs must tarry here till heaven grow milder. In faith, a brave attendance! RACHEL. Speak, for pity! Who is she, good Aquarius? MENNO. Here comes help To pluck thy red-hot moon from off the wall, And quench it in the Danube, by-and-bye. I called for drink. FERRYMAN. The rain has blinded thee. Canst not discern a scutchion from a sign? NETHERSTEIN. A castle, from a change house? FERRYMAN. Such a lady, From Hostess Joan? NETHERSTEIN. Or such a lord as I From tapster, chamberlain?—set wide thine eyes. MENNO. Is it so indeed? RACHEL. Thou shalt have what thou wilt— Who is she? tell me who she is? quick! quick! MENNO. The Countess Altheim, Lamback, Schwannenstadt— RACHEL. Call Catherine hither. Where is Minna Been? A Countess? MENNO. And an heiress—while a maid The Baroness Rabensberg. RACHEL. The Count come with her? Bring me my hood and mantle—run upstairs! MENNO. He comes from Rabensberg, and she from Reid. They meet upon the Danube by consent. RACHEL. He comes to meet her here? MENNO. And take her on. His kinsman Otho Jucold brings her hither. Our readiest road was that which runs by Linz— But there the pest is. Passau lies too high. The last night's reckoning should have made us earlier: Who may confront such blasts! RACHEL. Grace, what dost stare at? Light fires in both the chambers, magpie—quick! Bid Thwart prepare to serve with Melchior Tauss. Hast eels or fish, Belthazar Netherstein? NETHERSTEIN. Two krales of fish, and eels in all the putcheons. GRACE. A leveret pasty? PRUDENCE. Plovers stuffed with sage? MINNA. A forest chine for baking? GRACE. We have quales? PRUDENCE. The largest copper? RACHEL. Puppet, light the furnace. The Baroness Rabensberg? and how long married? (Enter Catherine.) Walk thou with me, child, but forbear to speak. MENNO. The compact is exceeded—we must mend it By notes upon the margin—codicils— Or hear no more from me. RACHEL. Storch, heat the oven: Now where is Bernard Brann to flay the coneys? Give me thine arm, child; I must seem to lean. This Colen might befriend us now—What ails him? That dog's face is abashed at last! Stop, sirrah! What dost thou run away for thus? FERRYMAN. To hide it. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. The Mill House. An inner apartment, with hangings of needlework. Countess and Otho Jucold. COUNTESS. What hope of better weather? OTHO. None to-night: The wind blows spitefully and full this way. COUNTESS. We must rest here, then. OTHO. He who looks abroad Need use his hands to keep his feet the steadier, And hold by what seems fixed or least disturbed. COUNTESS. Canst see across the Danube? OTHO. 'Twixt the blasts, And when the rain forbears to pelt and blind us, The boat is seen, but nothing else we wait for. All breathing life seeks shelter. Half-drowned trees Mark where the river's margin used to be. Some yield both leaves and branches to the wind, And purchase safety for their lightened trunks With what the imperious tempest robs them of. Others float by with all their green boughs round them, As wearied of the struggle and subdued— Like wrestlers fallen. COUNTESS. Dost know what time it is? OTHO. An hour to sunset. COUNTESS. Are the servants cared for? OTHO. They and their horses largely. Were it calm, We scarce could cross to-night. COUNTESS. You will not cross To-morrow nor the next day—so adieu! I shall wait here for better guidance hence. Your charge is ended, sir. OTHO. Return—what now? In such a night as this go back again? COUNTESS. Go when you please, or where, if not with me. OTHO. My lord expects to find me here. He will Distrust the haste which could not wait his coming. COUNTESS. And if he do, he will at last think justly. I can interpret for thee. It were well Such knowledge found his ears without thy presence: And wise in thee to teach by deputy. Art studious lest thy kinsman should mistake? Both he and I have done so. We have thought— Like those who find divinity in fools— That something good might bless the dreaming spirit With safer revelations now and then— Visions of holier promise—that the flowers So gaudily embroidered on thy brain, Had honor for their foil, and truth behind them. Henceforth I shall loath such for seeming thus, And scorn myself for trusting them. OTHO. It was The grace of such fair thoughts that dazzled me! Trust in my temperance made me drunk! I reel, But not away from honor. COUNTESS. Honor was it, Which whispered foully of adulterous hope? Sighed to supplant a benefactor? Nay, The ear of baseness tingles not, or else I might have blushed to say how largely so. OTHO. I never had a hope which wronged his peace. COUNTESS. Then what you told to me, tell him:—why not? Make the profession face to face, if true. While I stand by, begin your history— Say that you love his wife—have told her so— Being careful for the honor of us both. Or else, shall I say this? OTHO. If so, say all: Tell him the sort of love as well. Perchance He may remember how his own began, And start the less at mine. COUNTESS. His own? Was his Unmatched with his condition—conscience crossed? What sacred laws did his break? OTHO. I have heard That some it did; and those, in part, the same. Conscience, being largely feed, kept out of hearing. COUNTESS. What hast thou heard, knave? OTHO. This is tyranny! I suffer if I answer or forbear. COUNTESS. Wouldst half unwrap a falsehood—then retract And cover it up again? Speak out! heard what? OTHO. That friendship, like an image made of wax, Dissolves before love's heat and disappears. My lord was neither free himself to love, Nor loved the free. COUNTESS. Hast followed tales like these The road to baseness? run so fast with hearsay? Harnessed thine honor to a lie? The Count Could know but what I taught him of my freedom: Have I misled thee too? Believing this, How then? What share in it hast thou? love thee! Why, sick imagination's gorge is strained Conceiving its own argument. Thrust faith With all that awes or hinders out of sight; Or changing, not confounding, our estate— A flax-girl I—and thou a nobleman— Presuming any change but that of will— Dost think thy hopes were nearer? OTHO. I have none. We gaze upon the heavens, content without them. Is love like this an injury? COUNTESS. Ay is it! A loathsome one is any kind from thee. The purest possible a gutter's vapour. I pray thee take thine incense to the kitchen. Look for some idol with a fire before it; And suit the goddess to the worshipper. Why shouldst thou gaze upon the heavens? Be gone— Send me this lady's steward.—O here he is! (Exit Otho. Enter Netherstein.) COUNTESS. Thy message from the winds is not a kind one: I thank thee nevertheless. They will not hear us? We may not cross to-day? NETHERSTEIN. The drift scuds faster, And Danube rises, though the tempest lulls. These are not bated yet. Were I a traveller, I should prefer rough fare, with honest lodging, To darkness in a night like that before us— Even if there were no river. COUNTESS. So should I With power to choose 'twixt roadside-fare indeed, And the dark road. Our haste to get away Is quickened by the pain we cause in tarrying: We press too heavily here. Superfluous kindness Expels us while it holds us. I must quit, At risk of missing him who comes to meet me. O, that thy mistress were but half so good! NETHERSTEIN. Double her goodness scarce would seem too much. No fear lest patience fail me that way tested. My portion of the cherry, as it is, Is but the stone. COUNTESS. Hush! hush!—Couldst not befriend me? Suggest that ease is fevered by excess? Raise banks about her hospitality Which overflows and drowns me? NETHERSTEIN. Such a prayer Would light amongst the poultry like the pip: Slay all, and haply reach to larger matters. She would not bate a feather. Let her be; Or strive to eat her up. COUNTESS. At any time Our presence were a burden here: but now, So new a widow troubled with such guests! Her daughter's eyes are filled with tears. I see A hatchment o'er the gate. NETHERSTEIN. Her father's scutcheon. COUNTESS. An orphan like myself when younger still! NETHERSTEIN. Nay, she is old enough to let him slip; She weeps not for her father—has forgotten him. His widow never will forget the while The moon endureth—nor let me forget him. I fain would shake this father by the hand Alive and in his place again. COUNTESS. There is Too bright a hue upon her cheek for sorrow's— Else might the angel Pity call her sister. Whom shall we trust if she too is forgetful? Her mother spoke of some unworthy choice: Would call a stranger in to arbitrate! Asks aid of me! thinks fancy may be quenched By hints which casual kindness throws upon it! Heart-counsel from the ignorant passer-by! A worthy lady, but of strange conclusions! What can I do? NETHERSTEIN. She thinks that one so great Can do and undo harder things than this. Were she a countess she would stop the wind, Or blow it back again. The girl is good: An honest man the one she thinks about. COUNTESS. Of what estate? NETHERSTEIN. He was the Ferryman. COUNTESS. A ferryman! and she of gentle blood! This swift oblivion of her father's death, With such a love succeeding! NETHERSTEIN. Fifteen years Suffice for grief: he died when she was three. At holy-rood she counts eighteen. COUNTESS. What sayest? NETHERSTEIN. His heiress has succeeded to his shield, With nothing else, these fifteen years:—her sighs Are not for him. COUNTESS. A hatchment o'er the gate For fifteen years? NETHERSTEIN. It has hung there but twelve. These twelve seem long enough, and many enough, To him whose gate it is—her second husband. The first had none to hang it on. COUNTESS. A second? NETHERSTEIN. She has had, and she still has, two. The first Her ghostly man of honour, Knipperbrock, Whose scutcheon shines above the other's door— A spectral champion kept to talk about— O'er-awes and shames his fleshly counterpart. COUNTESS. What is this last, and where? NETHERSTEIN. A married miller; Lord of the ferry here. He is on earth The duplicate of Knipperbrock above: Takes toll and tribute with both hands. So much For what he is—Belthazar Netherstein: The other part, the where he is, is answered, For here he is. COUNTESS. Her husband? NETHERSTEIN. Bodily: In temporal things. COUNTESS. Didst thou not say her servant? NETHERSTEIN. Ay, so I am, indeed—the twain in one; First servant, second husband—minor domo. My lady might prevail to do me good. The man defunct has had a twelve-year's preference: It is my turn to head the partnership. I would have this made known without offence; And henceforth take priority. Enter Chatherine. Come hither— The child and I have what this sprite has left us. Speak wisely, mouse! [Exit Netherstein. COUNTESS. Bear with me yet a little; I am not thankless for my welcome here: But scarcely less bewildered than the sot Who slept a clown, and woke an emperor. This lady is thy mother? CATHERINE. Yes. COUNTESS. And noble? CATHERINE. My father was. COUNTESS. I never will distrust What nature writes upon a page so fair; Nor ask if eyes like those could look toward folly. Let us be friends at once—date sisterhood Neither by months nor years, but her suggestion. Away with blushes, then. There is a task So pinned to my consent by many prayers, Girt on by gratitude, that doing it, Or leaving it undone, I should blush too. Might we not ease each other? There must be Some witchcraft here. CATHERINE. If so, my lady brought it. COUNTESS. I came since noon, and am already suborned To interpose with spells against love's wiles, And wedlock's injuries! A stranger spurred By adjurations leaps where friends walk trembling! Would we were such, indeed! CATHERINE. I should wish so If both were humbler, or myself the greatest: Now all I ask is clearance from ill thoughts Suggested to my shame. COUNTESS. Well answered, maid! If something proudly too, why, perhaps the better. What right have I where love has locked his pearls? At least forgive me. CATHERINE. Think me that I am— Indeed a child, ill-taught and ignorant; But neither proud nor thankless. Shame it is Which burns at last against unjust abasement. My lady blushed for me: a stranger hears Of that which, when it prospers, hides itself— Is bashful at the best; though praised and happy Creeps out of sight: but here is cried abroad, With fie upon it, in the ears of greatness; And told to beggars as they pass the door. Why did my lady speak so heedfully, But that she thought the thing she spoke of shameful? COUNTESS. I thought love's choice unworthy, not love's self. CATHERINE. Now Heaven forgive me, for I will speak proudly! If there be truth in those who lived before us, The fair and noble did not think so once. COUNTESS. What thought they not? CATHERINE. That gentleness is baseness, The brave unworthy. COUNTESS. Ah, since Love could talk, He lisped his eloquence with infant lip, And ever reasoned thus 'gainst fortune's crosses! His second childhood babbles like his first. Let us pluck off the roses from his pate, And see how bald it is. Why, every shepherd Seems bright as Mercury to the maid who loves him. These May-day garlands fit ten thousand wearers. My gentle hostess, scorn such worshipry! A holier altar is there for our prayers, Than this of love: and if we would do well, We must present a costlier sacrifice. CATHERINE. What sacrifice? COUNTESS. Both what appears to be, And sometimes too what is our happiness. CATHERINE. But wherefore should we? COUNTESS. Our own hearts constrain us. By such a tenure do we hold our state: On this condition is it ours. We turn And leave the chase of butterflies to babes. If nobly born, thou hast no choice of baseness. CATHERINE. I do not choose it when I love the noble. COUNTESS. A ferryman? CATHERINE. Were I a Countess too, I should not blush at all—being proud to love him. Enter Netherstein. NETHERSTEIN. There is, at last, a running to and fro 'Twixt boat and burrow on the farther side: Such signs of speech as deaf men hearken at— Uplifted hands and bonnets. COUNTESS. Then he comes. NETHERSTEIN. The wind blows trumpet-like. They cannot cross! We scarce dare trust the covert whence we peep, Such gusts and angry eddies howl against it. Tiles drop even here, though looking leewardly, With all the house between. Enter Otho. OTHO. They hoist a pennon. COUNTESS. The Count's? OTHO. We cannot see its blazonry; The streamer points this way. COUNTESS. Then what dost judge by? OTHO. Their numbers, and the plumes upon their caps. COUNTESS. But can they cross the river, sir, or no? OTHO. The wind is with them. COUNTESS. Call the ferryman: His practice may instruct us what to hope. Let the rest watch again. Exeunt Netherstein and Otho. Enter Tycho Thollpinne. COUNTESS. So! who is this? TYCHO. My lady's ferryman. COUNTESS. Shame on thee, Cupid! To drown a Triton! Breathe, and dry thy tears. What is it that afflicts thee thus? Alas, His sorrows choke him! Can my lord come hither? TYCHO. In time he may—when the wind falls he will. I care not if he tarry there till Christmas. Let him go back again, or bide my crossing. (Cries without.) The boat is off. TYCHO. A good deliverance then! COUNTESS. Dost doubt it, Patch? This nature's nobleman! CATHERINE. Who? Thollpinne? This is Tycho! COUNTESS. And what is he? CATHERINE. He helps the ferryman. TYCHO. I did my best With larboard oar these three years past in June. But now I cannot help him. CATHERINE. What has chanced? TYCHO. His wits have slipped the painter—drifted off. Past help he is. COUNTESS. Then, prithee, let him rest. TYCHO. The Count? I will do so. COUNTESS. The ferryman. CATHERINE. What dost thou grieve for? TYCHO. None in twenty leagues Could pull a wherry with him up the stream; Nor break a random colt in thrice the time. He rode Schweile's brimstone gelding 'cross the Danube Stark naked like a babe. In twelve-score yards, Outran Stark's warrener by half a pole; And gave the flying tailor what he asked. Punt lost five bouts in six at single stick: Shadrach and Melchior with the mergenstern. He fixed the weathercock for Abraham Screech; And carried Taus's load with him astride it. If Gregory brags he lies—I saw Giles under. The angel of the house he was! CATHERINE. Where is he? COUNTESS. What has befallen him, sirrah? TYCHO. Beseech your grace To speak on his behalf! COUNTESS. To whom? TYCHO. Her mother. COUNTESS. A three-fold mediation! What about? TYCHO. Let him be married—he has lost his wits, Who was the stay of all awhile ago! His face is crusted like a calves-head pasty. One might make fritters from his cheeks—they shine Like morris-men's at Whitsuntide. Behold, His father could not know him! (Enter Mark Menno, leading in the Ferryman disguised with meal on his face.) MARK MENNO. Now—your curtesy— We look for country breeding, but beware! My lady will speak first. COUNTESS. A mask to-day? Why, this is changing Tycho for a fool! Small brains for none at all! Is he the right one? Thou natural nobleman, art drunk or crazed? Canst answer what I ask thee? FERRYMAN. Let me hear it. My lady must not always trust outsides. COUNTESS. She must not always; then she does sometimes? Why mask where known? FERRYMAN. Ask thou thy mother, Kate. It is a contract sworn to whilst I tarry. I keep my footing here by such a pact; And thou thine ears. COUNTESS. Canst see the ferry-boat? FERRYMAN. The while it swims, I can. COUNTESS. Dost doubt its swimming? FERRYMAN. Not if they miss the shoals, and keep her free. [Going. I will return again. COUNTESS. I pray stay here; Let these look out, and tell us what befalls. How keep her free again? FERRYMAN. Their craft swims deep— Her gunwale nothing with the wind abeam; Yet must they hoist a rag or two for clearance. She makes but little way, howe'er it blow. NETHERSTEIN calls. They near us, boy. FERRYMAN. But can they stem the current, And keep her quarter to the wind? OTHO calls. The Count! I see their liveries. They are past half way. FERRYMAN. Come to the wool-room casement, Netherstein. COUNTESS. Stay thou by me. TYCHO. Seek counsel from a fool? FERRYMAN. I may be nearer than I thought I was; Like many a counsellor who doubts not yet. The senses or the brains are leaky somewhere. TYCHO. I told my lady so. FERRYMAN. When heaven is mildest No tongue can send its meaning half across. In such a day as this, the lip and ear Need touch, and do their best for one another. Yet did I hear my name, with cries for aid, Far off, and mingling with the blast it rode on— Shrill as the tempest's wailing—help! help! help! Even thrice I heard it. COUNTESS. How long since? FERRYMAN. An hour— It may be less than one. If all the bones The Danube buries from us, lived again— And every mouth were hallooing through the storm, I had not heard, or hearing, understood them. That cry I did hear nevertheless. NETHERSTEIN calls. They come! All hands are baling her: the boat swims low. COUNTESS. How many canst see? NETHERSTEIN. Why, ten or twelve. FERRYMAN. Close-reefed? NETHERSTEIN calls. A quarter of the foresail—yet too much. TYCHO. The shoals have shifted place since yesterday. Fresh banks and drifting trees are everywhere. A duck would wait at home for better weather. NETHERSTEIN calls. The scullery-casement looks upon them now: This way, Sir Otho. Stop! she strikes—hold! hold! Twice struck! her mast and tackle overboard! Fast! she is fast! they cannot help themselves! No—now she swims again. COUNTESS. Where is this casement? FERRYMAN. Stay near her, Kate—and do not let her go. [Exit. Enter Rachel. RACHEL. Is it the Count, child? Sirrah, what art doing? [To Tycho. Make haste, and take the boat to him. TYCHO. Canst tell The readiest way, and how to get her there? Wouldst run aground for love of company? Then let us go together, Mistress Moon. (Exit Tycho.) NETHERSTEIN calls. They tail to leeward, right upon a shoal! O, help! they ground again! RACHEL. Count Altheim lost! Why, where is Colen? COUNTESS. Call the Ferryman. Enter Otho. OTHO. Less than an arrow's flight from twenty friends, Two nobles perish! Enter Tycho. TYCHO. Wherefore mouth the wind? Better to drown in peace, than burst with bawling. What use of waving hats? If Dark is there, Heaven's mercy on his babes! COUNTESS. Can no one help? TYCHO. He can, but no one here below. A cork Were worth a hundred wherries. COUNTESS. Here is gold— Or else for pity help us! Enter Ferryman. TYCHO. Gold, boy, gold— Thou mayest feed eels with florins in thy pocket. FERRYMAN. It is a sight for devils—away to bed! Men must go mad, or run from it. NETHERSTEIN calls. She swamps— The boat breaks under him. RACHEL. Didst say two nobles? NETHERSTEIN calls. They hold by stumps and branches—six or eight— The strongest dies the last. RACHEL. Two Counts, didst say? OTHO. Count Altheim and the Lord of Rabensberg. Give air—stand farther back. RACHEL. Of Rabensberg? FERRYMAN. Run with me to the skiff—it lies up stream— Now stir and help me. TYCHO. Thou mayst wash thy face Without my help, cock robin, or the Danube's; In clearer water too. So bide content. What dost thou want the skiff for? FERRYMAN. Come with me. TYCHO. Not to the Count. FERRYMAN. Set me afloat, and leave me. CATHERINE. Stop, Colen! hear me! RACHEL. Let him go, child—fie! Ah, hussey!—shame upon thee! FERRYMAN. Hold her back— And if I perish, as I think I shall— For he that called me by my name just now, Was farther off than all on this side death, And spoke with louder tongue than nature uses— Farewell to both! Instead of giving gold, (to the Countess.) Receive her from me as a legacy— I know thou wilt be good to her. [Exit. TYCHO. Come back! If man might help, I had not tarried here. Nay—prithee—stop him, sir! wouldst drown thyself? [Exit. NETHERSTEIN. 'Twere easier stop the tempest. He is desperate! Heaven's mercy go beside him wheresoe'er! Look up, mouse!—deaf and speechless?—in a swoon? My lady prays—pray too!—the angels hear thee! RACHEL. Wouldst have him bide, if he may save the Count? NETHERSTEIN. He cannot save a hair of him. Look out— Who watches at the casement there? M. MENNO calls. Now for it— The skiff is floating—if they could but wait. Miller, come hither. NETHERSTEIN. I will look no more. Is Colen in the skiff? Do thou stay there. I will not see him drowning. M. MENNO calls. Off! she swims— There is one in. Both! both!—the boy goes too! NETHERSTEIN. I knew he would. Sir Otho, run down stream! Be ready with the rest below—wait for him— And land him if the current drift him thither. [Exit Otho. M. MENNO calls. Scarce half have kept their hold—two more fall off! NETHERSTEIN. Can the skiff live, man? does it near them yet? M. MENNO calls. Hold fast a moment longer! Three bide still. They hang upon the driftwood's roots and branches. The skiff is grounding—all must perish now! Off—she is off again! look! now she floats! NETHERSTEIN. But can she reach them? Have they loosed—or how? M. MENNO calls. Swept past! The boat swims wide and far below— Gone by a mile! Not one is on the shoal! NETHERSTEIN. Then mercy on them!—Colen in the boat? M. MENNO calls. The boy is there. NETHERSTEIN. And not the ferryman? M. MENNO calls. There is but one—and he rows fast ashore— He will do well enough:—pull mightily! Pull, boy, for life!—What now? His oars back water! He waits for something!—Fool—to drown thyself! By holy Nicholas—hands and heads above! Hands on the tiller! Bravely, Tycho, yet! Row for thy life, good boy! two heads astern! Hold hard a moment longer, ferryman! I see two heads! NETHERSTEIN. Then one of them is Colen's. M. MENNO calls. They fish them from the water—two are saved! They land them—both of them—beside the boy! NETHERSTEIN. Then Colen left his skiff upon the shoal, To swim down stream, and pick up one of them. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Morning. A large Granary, connecting the House and the Corn-mill, furnished with meal-sacks, &amp;c. Ferryman and Tycho. FERRYMAN. After their wrath the Heavens are friends with us. They cast their dark and wintry cloaks away To show like princes at a monarch's bridal. Remorseless as they are to smile so soon Above the scatterings of their cruelty; And quite forget how many saw their rage, Who will not wake to feel their gentleness! TYCHO. What casts thee down so? These are past the caring For sun or squall! They will not feel the heart-ache, As we, with better luck, may live to do. FERRYMAN. Hast heard how many lost, and who they be? There were two noblemen? TYCHO. We have our share. One man in ten is saved, and he a Count. Some think there was no other aboard. My lord Says nothing, or as little; snorts and snifts The while they question him, but holds his peace: Looks at them right and left, then up and down. A maid of ten might sneeze as heartily. The river hath gone nigh to melt his wits, And wash his soul out. “Is your lordship sick?” “Ay,” saith he. “Is your lordship well at ease?” “Ay,” saith he too. The moon shines full upon him, And will breed May-fly-maggots in his brain. He walks a yard or less, and tires of it: Smells at his kerchief daintily, then sighs, And so sits down again to scratch his finger. The hand inside and out must be regarded. FERRYMAN. One special nurse he has beside his wife. TYCHO. His lady, sir,—his Countess—pray take heed! It were well worth a long pull up the stream To see this wife and her that shall be thine Placed side by side, like swans upon a pool; 'Midst whitest water-lilies, whitest swans, Save that the one of them is red with blushes, The while the other praises thee. Come down! And let them view thee now thy face is cleansed. The fish will profit by its last night's scouring; And I shall save my grains. FERRYMAN. I must be hidden: At least so much of me. Before she see it, Another noble lady must require it. TYCHO. She fain would have thee for her right-hand guest. There is no stint on such a holiday: But every breech is welcome to its stool. Free trenchers to all comers—forest hams, Pigs' faces garnished with their pettitoes, Soused ears, and collar'd brawn down both the tables! Fair pasties thank the mouths that eat them up. And there be such as watch the house-door open To bid the founder happy time of day. It is a sin to grieve at doing good. (Sings.) The sun is mirthful up on high; The earth is blushing at the sky; The river laughs and ripples by; It is the first of May, sir. The chapel bell ringeth—the little bird singeth, The dew falls from the spray, sir. Whatever hand bringeth, we know whence joy springeth, Down on thy knees and pray, sir! FERRYMAN. Get back among the pasties, then I will. TYCHO. I never was in love but with my mother: And she was worth a church-full like Grace Geert. No swan, indeed! but up by break of day To set my porridge hot upon the hob. Then Tycho was a nobleman. Her eyes Were on him, going forth and coming home. He would feel better pleased to see them yet Than twenty such as Geert's, or Minna Been's. I shall grow fog-bound too if prisoned here. Come down and sun thyself. If fixed on fasting, And obstinate in emptiness—walk forth! The smoking ground smells sweetly after rain. Earth is a mighty mesh-tub—steaming, brewing: The blessèd sun the brewer. This sick Count Is tethered for a day or two. FERRYMAN. At least. The horse-boat must not swim 'midst shoals and eddies; And half his company would swamp the skiff. Nor can they leave their cattle here. TYCHO. Would'st know What makes me glad? FERRYMAN. Ay—tell me. TYCHO. Thou shalt tarry. Old Dark and Abraham Screech are with the saints. There is none other now on either side. I want the learning but to say—Amen. We need a wiser parson. What dost think Of warnings 'cross the Danube, in the wind? That voice which called thee by thy name, last night? Hallooing for life? It ducked, but should have drowned thee. FERRYMAN. Hark! TYCHO. What affrights thee? FERRYMAN. There are steps—look out! TYCHO. I hear the moon-light—creep—creep—creep. She has thee! There is no meal at hand. FERRYMAN. Hast got the key? TYCHO. It locks upon the outside—not within. [Stands on the sacks and looks out. This Count alive again, by Rabshekeh! Peep 'twixt the shutters.—Softly with him, sir! He leans upon his kinsman. Gently!—so— They come abroad to sun and air themselves. If he look ever as he does to-day, He barely pays for saving. FERRYMAN. Which way go they? TYCHO. Why, this way—straightway—hitherward, direct. FERRYMAN. How shall I 'scape, or hide me? TYCHO. Face their faces— Thine is as good as theirs. Why shouldst thou hide it? They made no contract with thee. FERRYMAN. Help this once! 'Twere better leap the window-sill. TYCHO. Come down! Wouldst break thy legs? FERRYMAN. They are upon the stairs! Pull forth a sack or two before the ruck! [Removes a sack of corn. Make me a hole behind it. TYCHO. Get thee in: Snug as a parlour—here is room for two. With bread and cheese, I could endure a sevennight. Sit down and go to sleep. FERRYMAN. A sack above— Here, cross the top, boy! TYCHO. I will roof thee in. They rest upon the landing-place. FERRYMAN. Make haste! TYCHO. Wilt have a larger chimney over head? More breathing space? So, here he is!—wheeze, wheeze. [As the Count and Otho enter, he turns his back and sings. “Her girdle was golden, her garments were green; So I asked where she came from, and who she might be: ‘A king is my father, my mother a queen; And I come from the salt-sea, for love, child, of thee.’” This trap is old and naught, like father John. Even rat-traps will wear out! as saith the text. Vermin can slip their legs from 'twixt his teeth: He missed a weasel yesterday. [Sings: “If thou art a mermaid, and dwell in the water, That is not the life which seems pleasing to me: Though I be a goatherd, and thou a king's daughter, I will not go with thee all under the sea.” She is denied of him, but says again: “My coach is a”—Save us! what wouldst have? I do abhor to be affrighted thus. Your servant, sir! but why shouldst come behind me? OTHO. What frights thee, gentle goatherd—not the mermaid? The younger of the Ferrymen, my lord! TYCHO. His grace is welcome! By the mass, he looked More mermaid-like at sunset yestereven, Than he doth now—except that such as they, Swim not with boots and spurs upon their legs. I give your lordship happy time of day! COUNT. Thou canst not; yet I thank thee, boy. TYCHO. No! why? The merry heart is meat, drink, clothes, and fuel. Most feel but simple when we fish them out. A bellyful of nothing makes one sorry: Water is worse! Colen strove all he might— Did he not, sir?—to keep both heads from drinking. He ever swims breast high, and looks about. My lord came landward like a wounded coot: And Colen, with him, like a water-rug— Only he doth not carry in his mouth. OTHO. Thy likenesses lack nothing for resemblance, But being unlike. TYCHO. They do not hook-and-eye Both top and bottom, fitting everywhere; But hold i' the midst. This Colen knows a Count For what he is, although his hat be off: And picked him, half-way under, out from three. He could discern a Count drowned fifty years, If he might see a rag on's skeleton. So might I too, while lords wore crimson breeches, And clad their serving-men in Lutzen-blue. Not now; but almost always guess amiss. COUNT. Where is this Ferryman? TYCHO. He hides him somewhere— Creeps out of sight for fear the moonshine blind him. Unless he ride on Gipsey to the smith. Her shoes want shifting. Here is roguery, sir! When iron was thirteen thalers to the pood, They made it tougher-grained than now they do. Two sets would last above a quarter's wearing— A rat-trap twenty years. COUNT. Go, find thy fellow. The lives of both were risked for mine last night. TYCHO. His was, but mine was not. COUNT. Didst thou not help? TYCHO. I helped the ferryman—and he the Count. COUNT. Well—canst thou find this ferryman, or no? TYCHO. Patience! Speak softly, sir! A rat has ears: He learns, by listening, what we talk about. Help me to shift the bean-sacks next that bin. The rogue is somewhere under, or behind. There be but six-score quarters. Do our best, And we shall near him yet by supper-time. COUNT. I cannot help thee. OTHO. Seek for Colen, boy. TYCHO. I was about to do so:—when I find him, What shall say to him? OTHO. We stay to thank him. TYCHO. He ever doth eschew men's thanks. COUNT. Be gone— And bring, or leave him, as he will. More air And easier breathing here—we can sit down— The house grows noisy. TYCHO. I will leave him then. My charge it is to lock the door behind me, While Melchior scowers the pewter. COUNT. Lock us in— So that thou lock out others. TYCHO. For how long? COUNT. Release me after dinner: now adieu! TYCHO. Then have your eyes upon the sacks for pity! If he should bolt, sir, head him back again! [Exit, singing. This is the rat the meal that stole, And powdered his whiskers rarely! This is the cat that watched the hole, And fixed his worship fairly! This is the dog that ordered the whole, And scapes from hanging barely! OTHO. At last, we are quit of him. COUNT. He leaves us room, If time and strength suffice, for that which brought us. Speak quickly, Jucold—tell me of my sleep, And what was said while waking? OTHO. When, my lord? COUNT. Wast present when they landed me last night? OTHO. I was. COUNT. Who else beside these ferrymen? OTHO. Some six or seven were there. COUNT. What said I, boy? OTHO. Nothing, my lord. COUNT. Nothing—or nonsense—which? OTHO. There scarce was so much sense as serves for nonsense. COUNT. But afterwards? OTHO. The twilight dawned at last. COUNT. What said I then? OTHO. Half words, and those half uttered: Inaudible enquiries sunk in sighs: The Countess, Rabensberg, myself, and more— Stilled out by syllables. COUNT. But was this all? Did Gertrude speak to me? OTHO. Sometimes she did— Small nursery questions, such as help remembrance. COUNT. Of whom? OTHO. Yourself—if cold, or warm, or easy. And sometimes of her cousin Rabensberg. COUNT. Were answered how? OTHO. Faith, many not at all: Most part by sobs and silence. COUNT. But this cousin? We talked of Baron Rabensberg, it seems? OTHO. Not otherwise. COUNT. I shall speak plainer, soon: And I must trust thee, Otho. OTHO. Trust me, how? COUNT. A perilous trust, boy—since thou hast at hand Thy book of grievances for ready reference— A trespass-roll of slights and injuries Set down, from time to time, as helps for memory: Rash words, and casual wrongs: the ancient cyphering Which kinsmen use to balance charity— Written, I say, with truth, and all against me. Therefore a dangerous trust it is. OTHO. Of slights? I never said so. COUNT. Thou hast thought so, Jucold. OTHO. As heaven is witness, never! COUNT. Why dost start? OTHO. My lord will hear me! COUNT. Presently I will. Hear what, boy?—what affrights thee? There must be Such thoughts between us two, as make it easier To say I trust, than love thee. Thou canst pay All grievances together in an hour— My sparing kindnesses when I was kind, Imperious looks at other times—the wrongs Which chafe dependence, be they light or heavy, Supposed or true. OTHO. What then, my lord? COUNT. Why then I shall stand one step nearer hell, than now; There is but one.—Go, hearken at the door. OTHO. This eager speaking wearies you—sit down. (Count leans against the sacks which hide Ferryman.) COUNT. Ay—but I must haste forward. Thou hast heard Of Gertrude's other cousin?—She had two— A younger brother to the one she asks for? Let us pass by this Baron Rabensberg— I say, the younger. OTHO. John of Rabensberg? COUNT. Well, John—and what hast heard of him? Speak truth. OTHO. What might offend in telling, perhaps. COUNT. No matter! Say what thou wilt, I must say worse. OTHO. He was The comrade of my lord—he should have been The husband of his Countess. COUNT. Should have been! So far the tale is shorter, then—Go on. OTHO. Nay, let the gossips bail their own report! Why make me sponsor to their forgeries? What part in it have I?—They painted, gilded, And robed their wooden image royally! No garniture was found too gorgeous for him. They wrote his title in the list of men Whom Nature sets like columns near her shrine On loftier pedestals, as more adorned, And wrought of purer metal than the rest, To hang her costliest gifts upon!—Betrothed, And almost married to the Baroness— This John of Rabensberg—the younger brother— Was superseded by his friend, they said! His friend and fellow-soldier stepped between! One that came with him as a marriage guest! To quicken pity for this lamb of theirs, They crowned his head with flowers—the good! the gentle! First both in mirth and meekness—yet so chaste, That tongues of older men were shamed from evil! The soldier followed with his eyes—the child With both his hands stretched out! COUNT. Thy breath revives A carcase which would make me desperate now: Blast me for ever, if we stood indeed Bare-bosomed at the steadfast seat of truth, With none to plead for pale humanity— Our errors, our temptations all swept out, While Justice weighed us, each one as he is, And irrespectively of accident, Rejecting love and pity from the scale, As guilty or not guilty. OTHO. If we did? Ay, but we do not stand there. If we did, We were accursed—both you and I, my lord. Then such betrayal were accursed indeed! But Love, though unacquitted, grasps so fast The feet of Mercy, that he must be heard. Could youth approach thus near, and then stand off? COUNT. These tell-tales have gained faith, it seems?—thou dost With all thy might excuse Love's guiltiness. A skilful advocate, but ill divine! Thou should'st have known at that time what inflamed it, When reason superscribed all fancy wrote; A joyful witness of its promises; Confirming outward grace by more within. Pure love, strong faith, chaste beauty's majesty! OTHO. I have known since, my lord. COUNT. Its shade at most: A faded portrait gazed at in the dusk! Even I, who stand so near to it, can see The change from love's and beauty's radiancy, To that reproachful hue which grief has bleached, Like marble-breasted Niobe's, with tears. OTHO. Some think this marble holds a heart yet harder. COUNT. No matter what they think. I would it were so. Better feel nothing than too much! Who thinks it? OTHO. 'Midst other changes, is this possible, That men may love and hate at once? That love Made mad by scorn, may so far hate the scorner As not to lose the properties of love? COUNT. Why dost thou ask me? OTHO. I believe it may. Love made my lord unfaithful—what made her? This seraph left her sunshine in the skies, To light upon the reptile prey of gold! Born rich and noble, must be more than both! So dropped her lover, kinsman, almost husband; The good, the gentle—but the youngest born, Even for his friend, a guest of yesterday! COUNT. All wide, and far beyond the mark! Thou aimest Thine arrows at the innocent: they pierce My side instead. The treachery is confessed— Dost also know the traitors? There were two— Two were betrayed by them—canst guess and pair us? OTHO. The lovers?—what, not both of them betrayed? COUNT. Ay, and the traitors went by couples too. This Baron Rabensberg was one of them: John's brother, whom you looked for yesterday. OTHO. How could the elder profit by his loss? John halved no lordships with him? Perhaps, indeed He loved her too? COUNT. He never said he did; But I believe he did. Nay, who did not! So near in blood, and sharing one estate, Opinion matched them on their nurse's knees: But Nature laughs at gossip's policy, Widening preposterous difference to extremes. As hills in storm and sunshine, light and shade, These brothers stood confronting one another: Yet were they not, in all things, all unlike. That which the other wanted, each had most. Opposed they were, but not dissimilar. Envy burns hottest 'gainst the first and nearest: A stranger's rivalry torments us less Than smiles upon the lip we know so well! Beside the partial gifts of love and grace, A younger brother sharing one estate! Equalled with him!—his peer! OTHO. My lord grows faint. COUNT. I cannot tell the rest, boy. OTHO. Let it be. I think I can by guess alone. COUNT. Then do. OTHO. The losers helped each other; I know not how— But peradventure thus it might have been: Some baseness whispered, some imputed guilt, Such as pate-shaking pity marvels at, And fain would hide for sake of charity. No matter what they were, if she believed them. Scorn would shut ears and heart 'gainst truth and mercy! She would not listen to one word. COUNT. She would not. John thought she dared not—crediting, like you, Inconstant preference for my state to his. Disdain it was which gave the bride away: Not avarice nor ambition. Ask no more: We are, and shall be childless. OTHO. John a soldier Was easily entreated, after all, And passing patiently marched off elsewhere! Yet do they say he died like one. COUNT. He died With twenty thousand more and not a braver— His friends on either hand, not face to face: His blood an offering to the soil which reared him, Not to a woman's scorn and fickleness. So much, for truth's sake, of him. Now this Baron. The kernel of our moral is to come. At last I reach it, but I break my teeth. The elder brother saw me in the place The younger fell from—I was Gertrude's husband— Joint heir, with him, at Rabensberg—his heir If longer lived, and he without a child. The gain was this adoption of an alien— A stranger for a brother—and at last, His name and lordship swallowed up in mine! The rival gone, the brother lived again! He turned, at first, his Cain-like brow this way, Then fled from me. OTHO. I would be shunned by such. COUNT. If safely, so would I. But seven years' silence Might end in noise enough. Our lands were mixed: We could not quit the thoughts of one another. And Gertrude, wondering at her kinsman's wrath, Would be his guest at Rabensberg to quench it: So sent me on to bear the olive-branch. At first the petted hound felt pleased and flattered: A moment's sunshine fell upon his spirit. He would run with me here to meet his cousin. But soon he swerved again! Ten times a day, On this side Rabensberg, his humour shifted. Rough roads and weather made rough tempers worse. We reached the Danube wearied by mishaps. In wilder eddies beat the rain against us A mile, or less, below the crossing place: It choked and blinded us. While some ran on, The grooms and horses were sent back a stage. A little moss-walled quarry arched with roots— Scooped out by panting goats for shade in spring— Close to the river's margin, held us two, While those before us sought the ferrymen. Ere this received us, Saul's mad spirit was on him. He would not cross—he would go back again! What could he tell the Countess if they met? That both were traitors, and his brother belied? At last I lost my patience too—“If both— Which first? which made the other such?” I said. This changed his mind once more. By all things just, He would reveal the treason ere he slept! A hundred imprecations pledged him now. More furious than the tempest over-head, He was upon his legs before they ceased. I caught and held him by the cloak a moment— He turned to strike me with his riding-rod. And now the fiend was busy with us both— The bank sustained him, but my sword passed through him So far that when I would have plucked it out, His carcase followed it, and fell my way, Hiding the hilt beneath it. OTHO. Through his back? COUNT. Ay, but he struck me!—there was no choice given me 'Twixt back and breast. 'Twere easier touch a snake— I must have thrown him round to get my weapon. Both swords are there, and his within its sheath. OTHO. How then? What followed? COUNT. How I reached the boat, And what I taught the servants, is recalled Like last night's brawls by drunkards. They stood mute. The ferrymen refused to cross with me. But gold prevailed on these, and threats the others— I forced them hither. OTHO. We are swallowed up By fortune's whirlpool; then tossed out again! Ten witnesses there were, beside these swords; And now, behold, not one! COUNT. A child might launch The carcase from so steep a bank down stream: But I, to-day, could not. It was for life! The wolf had seized my throat, boy! Wilt discharge This office for me?—first, pluck out the sword, And cast it from the body far enough— So sink them both? OTHO. Wait till the sun goes down. COUNT. But yet be speedy, Jucold! OTHO. Here they come!— A mile below the crossing-place? COUNT. Less—less: Let us walk forth; we may discern it, hence. TYCHO heard singing. “‘Why, what dost thou think of me?’ quoth our king merrily, ‘Passing thy judgment upon me so brief?’ ‘Both by leader and filler,’ then answered the miller, ‘I guess thee to be but some gentleman-thief.’” If I have dropped the key, now! Stop awhile— These pockets must be patched again. Hast seen him? OTHO. The key? TYCHO. The rat, sir. Lord, what thing was meant for! He is not off? Wilt tarry while I run? OTHO. Tarry for what? TYCHO. The ferrets. COUNT. Let us out! TYCHO. Well, patience! said the hermit to his belly. COUNT. Sirrah, hast lost the key? TYCHO. Hast lost the rat, Sirrah, my lord the Count? O, here it is! [Enter Tycho. My lord is looked for up and down the house. They soon will help the sun with candle-light, And sweep to find him. OTHO. Why didst keep us then? TYCHO. The chine kept me, pig's-cheek, and tansey-pudding, The leathern stoup, Grace Geert, and Minna Been; I had all these to think upon—beside The elder Ferryman. COUNT. Hast found him, owl? TYCHO. Your eaglish highness has not found the rat; Therefore, we have not found him. COUNT. Look again. TYCHO. I will. OTHO. Make haste, and send him after us. TYCHO. Ay, marry, sir. A pleasant time of day! My blessing on all three. I would be rid Of such a wardenship—so peace go with ye! The Countess frets about his lordship's health. The moon has boiled a treacle-posset for him. Therefore, fair speed, and maledicite! [Ex. Count and Otho. Sings: “Now run, now run, thou little foot-page! The saints thee save and see! Go, hie thee back, I do engage To die, or set him free.” [He removes the sacks, and lifts the Ferryman. Why Colen!—mercy on us!—weak as withs! What ails thee, primrose? frighted, or bewitched? I kept thee in too long: but by Saint Pippin, I meant to vex, not choke thee. FERRYMAN. Stand aside. TYCHO. Thou art not mealed again; and yet thy face Is white as Gabriel's bleaching-mead! What ails thee? Four leagues up stream in August would not sweat thee As those four sacks have done. Hast been asleep? FERRYMAN. I wish to think so. TYCHO. What didst dream of? FERRYMAN. Treachery. Wilt help me yet this second time? TYCHO. This sixtieth. FERRYMAN. I have to do what needs more hands than mine: And yet it shall be done. TYCHO. Thy wits were lost 'Twixt noon and sunset yesterday: to-day The fit comes earlier. There were cries for help— A voice across the Danube—fie upon thee! What hearest thou now? FERRYMAN. The same a second time. Go thou, and I will shew thee in a mile The lips they came from. TYCHO. If they shout so loud I need not go. FERRYMAN. I will. TYCHO. For what? FERRYMAN. For vengeance. TYCHO. Nay, by the saints in glory—I will not! Ask grace upon thy knees against the fiend. I do abhor to see thee gnaw thy lip. What part have we with vengeance? FERRYMAN. Justice, Tycho. Blood calls for that, at least. Wilt help, or leave me? No more than justice. TYCHO. What didst hear them talk of? I will not quit thee. FERRYMAN. Keep the skiff afloat. I must be masked again. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Chamber. Countess and Catherine. COUNTESS. He sickens at their names—so all are lost! I will no farther question him. Alas! That good and ill should mix their snakes and flowers, Like Pluto's married head by Proserpine's! If I might take my fortunes how I pleased, Provided that I took them, they should come Each kind apart. CATHERINE. 'Twere better so receive them, Being wisely joined or severed for our good, Even as they are sent. COUNTESS. Fair preacher on the text, We profit by mischances! 'Midst the wreck Where perished husbands, brothers, fathers, sons, I find a sister. CATHERINE. One poor servant gained For many better lost. COUNTESS. They were not lost, But rashly squandered to appease impatience. How shall we meet their eyes who wait our coming? I will not go to Rabensberg. CATHERINE. Where then? COUNTESS. Back, home again, fair sister. Thou art mine— Thy mother's gift and lover's legacy. He dying, as he thought, bequeathed thee to me, And I will keep thee. Where hast hidden this Colen, Who dares confront the hideous face of death, But not my thanks and mine? CATHERINE. My mother scares him. There is some pledge of patience toward myself, While he keeps out of sight. Enter Count and Otho. COUNTESS. Now, are they found? OTHO. One is—the boy. COUNT. We shall not need them yet. Let me grow stronger-stomached for this ferry. My last night's surfeit spoils the appetite. COUNTESS. Then let us back again. COUNT. Wait till to-morrow. COUNTESS. Well, so we will; but not to cross the Danube. COUNT. I must, at least. Otho shall pass before us, To sound the shoals, and choose a landing-place. OTHO. Mild as he seems again to those escaped, The river has consumed his banks, and lifts His sands above the surface. Enter Ferryman disguised, and Tycho. COUNT. What is this? A miller, or a meal-sack set on legs? The calendars have erred if Yule come yet. Our clowns are welcome with the holidays: Never till after harvest-home. COUNTESS. Hard words Rebound the farthest when they strike our friends: 'Tis masker's sport. The taller of the two Has seen a Countess at his knee. He lent His life to prayers and pity—nay, he gave it, Who hoped it not again. TYCHO. More fool for that. COUNT. Is this the Ferryman? COUNTESS. More fool—why so? TYCHO. The Counts, being wise, take pity on themselves. They swim not home with half-drowned ferrymen. It is the ass goes undermost. COUNT. No matter; He goes the road to fortune. This may build A bridge above the stream ye could not ferry, Which runs so deep 'twixt penury and ease. Now may he gallop dry-shod if he will. (offers a purse). FERRYMAN. There will be time to settle what is owing. We cross the Danube ere I take my toll. I have not done mine office yet, my lord. COUNT. So much as saving life is perfected. FERRYMAN. That part is not for payment. I will have Full measure, length and breadth, nor more nor less. It may be greater than my lord has thought of. We reckon ere we part. COUNTESS. I fain would see His face unshelled, who gives like Jupiter, And takes like Rhadamanthus. COUNT. There must hide Less wit than honesty beneath the crust. OTHO. If Tycho scorned the daughter of a king, What chance have we to tempt him? TYCHO. Build the bridge! Get Colen fairly on it, then I follow. My place is close behind him. Wet or dry, We ever pull one way. In this we differ, His wits have blown his wisdom all to rags: Mine do nor good nor harm. COUNT. Whence came that tempest? TYCHO. The way of pride it came; by emptiness— A foul and windy quarter. He puts off The grace he had to eat his meat with patience: So dreams of dreadful things—woe—witchcraft—wedlock! If I rowed stokesman, I could trust my lord: His money might come fairly, nevertheless. Seeing that he is none other than he is, I think no scorn of him. COUNTESS. Leave them to me. My debt is greatest, and began the first. Colen will take my surety for us both. I did not covenant to pay with gold; But shall find means to keep our bail from forfeit. Wilt thou not trust me, Colen? FERRYMAN. No, my lady. Let these bear witness that we two are quits. Our river manners here are foul not false: Therefore I pray have patience and endure them. For your sake, no. There is a spell upon me. None come so near me as to love me, hate me, Befriend me, injure me, have dealings with me— But fares the worse for me. Ask Catherine that: Who suffers most, knows best. The poor man's cradle Is looked upon by those same stars which shine O'er purple couches at the birth of kings: Their influence is alike, be it good or evil. Few mark the narrow path which baseness walks in; But each of us has one he needs must tread: Our choice is how, not whither. I had given me An easy-gaited spirit for life's road: Strong hands, light thoughts, brave health, glad thankfulness. These be good gifts, which none may share with me. To wish me well is perilous. COUNTESS. That is risked. I fain would make the hazard twice as great, By doing after wishing. FERRYMAN. Wait awhile! Sometimes our wishes are o'er-ruled in mercy. Before they pray again, those lips may curse. TYCHO. Dost think that ladies curse, and slap their pockets, Like Judeth Bounce? Fie on thee, simple one! Curse thee! Lord help thee! This is but by fits: His speech was clerkly more than most till late. Such muddy manners grieve not every day. Speak for him, mistress Starlight!—Come thy ways— She weeps, and cannot speak! FERRYMAN. Wilt row down stream? These bodies should be looked for 'midst the wreck And driftwood's tanglement. Old Dark and Screitch— With eight or nine—and one a nobleman? COUNT. Who told thee so? FERRYMAN. Methought there was another— A Count and Baron in the boat last night?— Your lordship's kinsman told me so. OTHO. Did I? FERRYMAN. Ay, thou—the Baron Rabensberg. OTHO. I said We looked for two. FERRYMAN. What tidings of them, then? You looked for two—and one is present here: Hast asked about the other yet—or no? TYCHO. Can the Count count his company? FERRYMAN. How now? A nobleman not thought of! OTHO. Who says that? FERRYMAN. Why dodge and double like a pounded stote? Is the man drowned? Was he aboard last night? In twenty hours not asked for? COUNTESS. Altheim, speak— I will know all. FERRYMAN. A nobleman, good sooth! The widow Ruful's innocent is missing— Slipped out of sight to sleep beneath the thorns— A fool, and mad beside, these forty years! All throats are hoarse with hallooing up and down. Or Melchior's colt is off with Gregorie's mule— We hunt them east and west. A nobleman, My lady's kinsman—some one said her cousin? COUNTESS. He is so. FERRYMAN. What has happened to him, then? This Baron's lordship falls to son or brother— His cousin the Count is not his heir, I trow? Has he a brother, my lady? TYCHO. Cousins are cheap As crabs at Martinmas. FERRYMAN. A shepherd's cur Whose mongrel ancestors were hanged by scores, Is better cared for here! COUNT. Take thy purse hence— Or let it lie. (throws it down.) OTHO. He has been asked about. FERRYMAN. Then what the news, sir? He turned back again? Was drowned—or how? COUNT. This knave grows insolent. COUNTESS. Speak—was he with you? I will know it at once! FERRYMAN. Where must we look for him? by land or water? And how expect to find him, wet or dry? The scabbard empty, or the sword within it? A soulless body, or the two together? OTHO. My lord grows faint. The otter-hearted brute, Whom all things flee from, or else fare the worse for, Can lose no friends, nor guess why those who do Should shudder thus, and grieve for them. TYCHO. Ye thought The otter did not swim too fast last night; But prized him for it. COUNTESS. Help us to the couch: He swoons again! Wait here, child. [Exeunt. (Ferryman and Catherine remain.) FERRYMAN. What! in tears? Still tears? CATHERINE. You forced them from me, Colen! FERRYMAN. I? Then chide again, but smile again. CATHERINE. Some say That not one day is happy all day through: Therefore I should be patient. Less than half Of one like this, would pay for ten of tears. FERRYMAN. What changed it thus? CATHERINE. I have heard many speak, With all their wit, in praise of something like thee, But what they said seemed little or amiss. To-day, a skilful tongue has tired its music, And made thy praises perfect. FERRYMAN. Didst not blush! CATHERINE. I did, as one that shared in them—yet hoped To hear them every day, and follow hence The sounds I loved the best. FERRYMAN. Whither wouldst go? CATHERINE. To Rabensberg or Schwannenstadt. FERRYMAN. Indeed! CATHERINE. You gave me to the Countess, and she claims me— My mother lends me. I shall learn to speak With purer words, and walk with shorter steps. FERRYMAN. Forgetting home and ferrymen?—there is No way so sure. Thou dost not weep for that? CATHERINE. Why push the open palm of kindness from us? I have beheld thee patient with the froward: While ribald ignorance has barked against thee, Bow down thy head, like flowers before the wind, To let its loud and ruffian gusts pass by— Never till now ungentle. It is well To shun, but not to scorn such thanks. FERRYMAN. Dost love This Countess, Catherine? CATHERINE. Ay, too much, I fear. FERRYMAN. Too much—why so? CATHERINE. Because I did too soon. Slow growths are surest. But she must be good! I fain would have thee love her. FERRYMAN. So I do. CATHERINE. She calls me sister. FERRYMAN. I must grieve thy sister. CATHERINE. For my sake, not again! FERRYMAN. So near to greatness, Wouldst not be great? CATHERINE. With all my heart, I would. FERRYMAN. A Countess? CATHERINE. Ay, an Empress. FERRYMAN. What wilt grant me? CATHERINE. A crown. FERRYMAN. Heaven bless your majesty, if less. CATHERINE. Both crown and sceptre—globe and eagle too. FERRYMAN. Thy subjects, like thy mother, would dethrone me. CATHERINE. Farewell to greatness, then! I would become That which I am again. Hark! Get thee gone! [Exit Ferryman. (Enter Countess and Otho.) COUNTESS. Excuse, and leave us, Catherine. (Exit Catherine.) This way, sir. Dost brave, or hast forgotten what I said? OTHO. Neither, my lady. COUNTESS. Why dost tarry, then? OTHO. I have an office here. My lord employs me. This tarrying is in duty—his appointment. How may I quit? COUNTESS. A faithful servant, truly, Whom yet his lord must learn to do without! The river runs between us ere we sleep— Choose thou the side that pleases thee. OTHO. Till now There was no time for choice, and now there is No power on my part—since he chooses for me. COUNTESS. Canst thou not feign some present haste? OTHO. What kind? Suggest the occasion for it. COUNTESS. I suggest! What wrong have I done? Wherefore help to hide one? I lack the readiness of ancient use— A lie would make me blush. Thou hast at hand, Beside the gifts of nature, art and practice. Large as they were, long study must have helped. OTHO. These arrows stick, indeed: but some as sharp Have pierced the innocent too! My kinsman needs me. COUNTESS. Needs thee for what? OTHO. To find a landing-place. COUNTESS. A perilous charge! I prithee set about it. Then trust thy learning to the ferrymen, And so pass on. They may report the issue. OTHO. It is a perilous charge—ill fit for them. My lord has business which they share not with me. His work is better perfected alone. COUNTESS. It should be little fit for honest men, If left to thee in preference. OTHO. So it is. The worse and harder part he did himself. I take the rest of it.—My lord expects me. COUNTESS. He did expect to find a beggar thankful: He looked for truth, and thought that he might trust thee. OTHO. He doth so still; beyond my seeking too— Less for mine ease than his. COUNTESS. What wouldst thou, sirrah! Speak plainly if thou canst. Let loose the leash Which holds back insolence. Darest thou say this! And this to me since yesterday? Be brief: Tell me what trust? OTHO. It would be marred if published. COUNTESS. Employs thee in it? OTHO. Full trust—sole agency— Especial preference in a charge of weight. COUNTESS. The more his need to learn his secret's safety: And mine the more to warn him. OTHO. Scarce in time For his behoof. I shall be spared my pains— So profit most. COUNTESS. By chastisement, or how? OTHO. He lacks both heart and instrument for that. The sheath came safe ashore, but not the weapon. COUNTESS. Dost brave the sick in bed? Art so much bolder Because his sword is lost? Both coward and traitor? OTHO. I know where I may find it. COUNTESS. Thou dost know That shame is sometimes patient of its wrongs; Since vengeance on the base is near to baseness. I risk it nevertheless. Come in! OTHO. Beware!— This ruin is not mine! Hush, hush!—for his sake! If present, he would ask it on his knee. Better to face that last-night's tempest twice, Than meet such witnesses, with me before them. Tell what you will to him. COUNTESS. A braggart now— To-morrow a beggar, too. OTHO. Beware of that Which may turn love to hate! COUNTESS. If scorn may do it, I would attempt impossibility, And strain abhorrence yet. OTHO. Go gently with me Sole heiress of John Rabensberg's sole brother— Count Altheim's wife—I warn her. COUNTESS. She defies thee! Gertrude of Rabensberg has never answered A threat in other words, nor will she ever. If ruin rest with thee, let it come down; I called thee traitor—coward. OTHO. And so is he. COUNTESS. Who is? OTHO. Count Altheim—both of them. COUNTESS. Well-timed, And reckoned carefully!—his sword is lost. OTHO. I go to find it. COUNTESS. Whither? OTHO. Where he left it. —So now for heart to second all this bravery— Fixed in your cousin's back—your elder cousin's— Not John's—he stabbed that too—with other weapons: This time it was the Baron Rabensberg's— Brother to him who was betrothed, half-married, Belied, supplanted by his friend and brideman. I spare no repetitions. I speak out. My work is not for ferrymen:—and yet The tallest guessed it like an oracle. One brother fell in battle—both are slain— The elder by that sick-man's hand last night. Count Altheim's sword is in the Baron's back, The Baron's in its sheath. I go to seek them. COUNTESS. What liar said this? OTHO. Count Altheim told it me: A liar confessed—his wife was gained by lying: But haply here he may be credited. Go, wake this husband—tell him what I say— Bring him, and call his servants. COUNTESS. Bravely done! I must, at last, in part retract my scorn— Excess of wickedness has something great! Dost think I credit half one word? OTHO. I do. Else why so pale? All three are ruined now! The spot on which to test me is at hand; A mile, or less, below the crossing-place. Send all the servants—both the ferrymen; Wilt trust us if we bring this cousin's corpse? COUNTESS. Stop here—who told thee so? OTHO. Count Altheim told me, Who would excuse this second murder thus, He slew his own confederate in the first; For John was foully murdered—slain in battle— But stabbed to death before. Look, tears at last! Ah me! a lie gained easier credence once, Than truth does now! But call your wisdom back— Chain up this frenzy! we may heal all yet:— A credulous infidel! COUNTESS. Count Altheim told it? OTHO. I say once more, his sword is in the corpse. He needed help to hide it—so revealed it— And not as giving vent to yeasty conscience, For truth sake, or repentance sake. I go To sound the river with these ferrymen; Seek out a landing-place, and leave them there: Then walk below, to sink our lordship-sharer Where justice may not find him. He lies near, Not in the stream. You scourged the apple from me— This Baron shared the guilt, but not the gain— His conscience grew perplexed—and late remorse Might breed offence. All three of us are traitors— One only stabs men's backs! At last you trust me? COUNTESS. What wouldst thou have? OTHO. But little till I earn it: No more than silence, yet. COUNTESS. Then cease and leave me. [Exit Otho. COUNTESS. Both dead! one murdered!—It is come at last! Our seven years' knot is loose enough! I pay In full to heaven the purchase of my pride! And this knave too—who smiles and teaches silence— He holds my ruin in his hand! He will At better leisure talk of love again! Threaten and smile, by turns! In pity he Will hint but now and then at former scorn, Content with present suppleness!—He will? Ah, will he so? And must I watch the face Of double murder?—hold my peace before it? Shall pride which, like the fiend, has led to this, Forsake me now? Stronger than love or pity, It drove him out who was too meek for vengeance, Too noble for complaint! [Exit. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Hall, with tables prepared for supper. Netherstein and Rachel. RACHEL. Set seats for five: but when the guests are placed, Prithee keep out of sight awhile. NETHERSTEIN. How long? Were keeping out of sight my business here, I might have spared the Saltsberg belt and hose 'Till All Saints eve or wake at Martinmas. Places should have respect to use and fitness. If so, and eating be the end of feasts, Mine would stand highest of all. RACHEL. The Count is sick. NETHERSTEIN. Let him keep out of sight, and me eat for him. RACHEL. My lady could not answer when I spake. Her kinsman's death hangs heavily; and yet She will sit down. Catherine is nobly born, So takes her place: till asked for, I stand by. NETHERSTEIN. Art less than she is? RACHEL. Now—in honor, I am: In nature, more. NETHERSTEIN. But which of these is greatest? My sour yeast spoils our batch. RACHEL. Look, thou dost carve: 'Till called keep back, I say; then show thyself. The roast will stand at bottom—I shall ask it. NETHERSTEIN. Catherine goes with them home? RACHEL. She does to-morrow. We two are bidden for Christmas. One thing grieves me. NETHERSTEIN. If only one, forget it, or defy it. RACHEL. I fain had supped the Baron ere his end, And counted three great nobles at the board. NETHERSTEIN. This trout has slipped thine handling. RACHEL. Go and shift. Look that the knives be steeled, then fill the flasks. We serve at eight o'clock:—bid Tauss be ready— The fawn is roasted whole and needs two bearers. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Chamber. Count and Otho. COUNT. Rowed the boat whither? OTHO. Down the stream, my lord. Their search is for the drowned. COUNT. Who told thee so? OTHO. They said themselves it would be so. COUNT. Why quit them? The sun is set—we risk our secret thus! I strive to think the knave who shot so near me, Aimed well by chance alone. But this is folly! Why let them go? OTHO. The Countess held me here Till these were past the haling to. COUNT. Straight down? OTHO. Not in midstream, but nearest this side yet. Our eyes may scarcely reach them in the dusk. COUNT. Why should they choose the twilight for their search? Thou canst not cross with them to-night? OTHO. I will. The moon is past the full—at nine she rises— They shall be taught that all must cross at dawn; And why to-night we seek a landing-place. COUNT. Make them search upwards—then run thou below. Swift, boy, not hasty—lest the work be botched. Throw the sword wide enough, and sink the corpse. OTHO. My thrice-repeated lesson is but short: I shall be perfect. We have most to fear From such quick questioning as the Ferryman's. COUNT. I cannot be excused at supper-time: The Countess wills it so to please her hosts. All must sit down, she says. OTHO. Must I? COUNT. And these! We play the prodigals—the swine feed with us. Our troughs are served at eight. OTHO. The moon is later. Even if the boat were ready, she is not: Nor can we do without her. COUNT. Hark! the clock! [Clock strikes. Come this way till they call. [Exeunt Count and Otho. (Enter Countess and Catherine.) COUNTESS. The boat is gone? And none within it but the ferrymen? If so—the better!—Almost eight o'clock? CATHERINE. The bell jars still—not hear it? COUNTESS. Why dost look So thoughtfully upon me, gentle Kate? Let us be merry, if we can, to-night— Both never will again. What grieves thee, child? CATHERINE. 'Twere better go to sleep! COUNTESS. Without our supper? CATHERINE. Leave it for healthier appetites. In truth I never saw a face so pale alive! Those eyes affright me. COUNTESS. Quarrel with mine eyes? CATHERINE. They look like gleeds of fire upon the snow! My lady drops the answers to her questions; Then stoops, like echo, for a word or two! Not hear the clock? COUNTESS. Thine eyes are gentler, Kate. I pray thee do not leave me, though I fright thee! I would be loved by some one that is good. CATHERINE. Let us prepare for bed. COUNTESS. No!—supper first. A cup of wine to bring my colour back.— We will have such a supper here to-night, As may be talked of after I am gone. Canst love me, sister Kate, indeed? CATHERINE. Methought I loved before, yet find it was but little— Nor could I love the happy half so much. COUNTESS. Then shalt thou profit by my teaching, child. Our homily so late as yesterday, Was pride—the scorn of baseness—gentle blood: To-night I give the sequel. CATHERINE. Hark!—they call. COUNTESS. Supper at last. CATHERINE. You tremble! COUNTESS. Stop awhile— CATHERINE. I pray sit down. COUNTESS. At table—so I will. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Moonlight. Bank of the Danube. The ferry-boat with the figure of a man in it. Tycho landing from it. TYCHO. Let one eye watch the boat, and one the moon. Thou great Astrologer, a word with thee! Sit starkly by the tiller there, and say Whether I die a bachelor, or no? My fortune, sir?—I can tell thine aright— The worms shall eat thee—by to-morrow's noon, The chapel-bell shall ring for thee. What sayst— Which of the two is wisest, Colen or I?— He fears no man alive, whose breath is in him: And I no dead one, be it fairly out. But thou hast lost thine foully—Heaven forgive thee! This iron-jointed Colen wept just now To see me pluck the sword from 'twixt thy shoulders:— He turned his face, and sobbed as doth a child! He loaths to touch thee! Enter Ferryman. FERRYMAN. Where hast left the corpse? TYCHO. He sits abaft as steersman, there. Boat! ferry! Shove off!—be quick, boy!—would that Blast were crossing! A cuff or two might warm this helmsman's ears, And grieve him less than me. FERRYMAN. Hast got the cloak? TYCHO. Cloak, hat, and both the swords, sir. Turns about! I had my load down hill the other side: If one of us must bear him up to supper— Take thou thy spell, as strongest. FERRYMAN. Give the swords— I cannot tarry now—we are too late— The guests have supped: so cast a sail around him, And come with me—make haste! TYCHO. Didst get inside? FERRYMAN. No—not beyond the door, but near enough. Give me his hat and cloak, with both the swords. I will wear one of them—run after me— But place a covering o'er the body first. TYCHO. He and the moon are eyeing one another, Which of the two looks palest! Let them be. FERRYMAN. Throw a sail over! TYCHO. Softly—patience—so! (Tycho covers the corpse.) [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Hall. The table covered with fruits, and wine-flasks. Count, Countess, Otho, Netherstein, Rachel, and Catherine seated. Servants of the house and of the Countess attending. RACHEL to servants. The service ends, sirs, now that grace is said. To help our meat we have but fruits as scanty: These we may reach ourselves. Set other cups, And flasks of sweeter wine, before ye go, Then leave us, if my lady need you not. COUNTESS. Stay yet—let Gregory wait. COUNT. We shall be shamed When Christmas brings our hosts to Schwannenstadt, Remembering how we banquet here. It is A feast for Charlemagne's peers! NETHERSTEIN. Ay, marry, is it; And all the emperors since, if each had been No larger stomached than my lord and lady. COUNT. We hope for better health, and lighter crosses. Bear lamps up stairs before the Countess, Ralph. Sleep is our best and safest nourisher. We must be roused at day-break—so farewell! Look out for pleasant weather, boy. The moon [To Otho. Is high by this time. Half-past nine o'clock! She rose at half-past eight. COUNTESS. Stop first a little; And tell your kinsman what you say he is. COUNT. What does he say I am? COUNTESS. Coward, traitor, murderer! COUNT. A murderer! (They all rise.) COUNTESS. So he says—a double one. COUNT. Whom does he say I murdered? COUNTESS. Both my cousins: The first by fraud, long since, and many hands: The other by thine own—behind his back— So late as yesterday. COUNT. Did Otho say it? OTHO. I did say so, and say it again, my lord. COUNT. Traitor and liar! COUNTESS. Sit down—let both sit still! The time is not for brawls—nor shall we stun So many ears by braggart cries and threats. His words are plain enough—canst answer them? He calls thee murderer; tells us who is slain; Time, place, and motive to the act. COUNT. Your cousins? COUNTESS. The youngest first, through me—lied out of life— Though slain in battle murdered by his friend! The elder yesterday. OTHO. He told me so— Cowardly murdered! COUNT. Some one lend a sword. And let him say so then. OTHO. My lord's is pledged— We must release it from this cousin's back! Come with me, miller—I will find and bring it. (Netherstein leaves his seat, and places himself between the Count and Otho.) NETHERSTEIN. This must be answered if the man is dead. Behind his back! COUNT. I answer to my prince. Arrest the traitor, Gregory Drinkinton! Menno, lay hold! COUNTESS. These are my servants, sir. Count Altheim has none here. They shall do so, And seize the traitor, be he which he may. COUNT. How! Gertrude! COUNTESS. Ay, the same—who will live yet Where honour keeps the roof above her head; Or pull its pillars down to cover shame, And die with all beneath it. Gertrude is No heiress of the murdered, nor the wife Of him who stabs men's backs. Why call for weapons? You can disprove his words, if false. He says The Baron's body lies within a a mile. OTHO. I do, and that Count Altheim's sword is in it: The Baron's in its sheath. Send whom ye will: I have been taught to guide them straight enough. One is a traitor. COUNTESS. If but one is such— No more than one—the Count is innocent. This kinsman, picked from out some lazar-house, Says that he loves his wife! Traitor confessed, A liar it may be. Enter Tycho, followed by the Ferryman, whose face is shaded with a plumed cap, and muffled in a cloak. He carries a naked sword in his hand, and places himself in the seat left by Netherstein. TYCHO. Melchior, stand aside. A lord they left behind is come to-night: The lord of Rabensberg! COUNTESS. My cousin? alive! OTHO. The lord of Rabensberg! FERRYMAN, discovering himself. I am such now: Your younger cousin, John of Rabensberg, Succeeds his brother in the barony— I was the Ferryman. RACHEL. Look! here again! Out, dog's-face! get thee gone, thou morris fool! Wouldst bring thy rogueries here, 'twixt life and death? With sword in hand, and plume upon thine head? Out with him, Melchior! drag him out of doors! FERRYMAN. Be patient, mother-in-law! There be some here— The Count and Countess—will remember me. She, when she speaks again, may tell thee so. My cap and cloak were left me by my brother: The sword beside me is inherited: This other was the Count's. TYCHO. Done bravely, faith! Rarely! as breath is life! The Count and Countess Do look upon him for a lord indeed! I have seen many a show come short of this. He passes Punch a league and all to windward! The moon herself is dazzled by him! hark! FERRYMAN. I claim scarce half of what is mine, Count Altheim: Only my name and honour. That is lost Which outweighs both. But on my brother's behalf— Whose blood it was which cried so loud last night— I ask for justice too. Is this sword yours? [Gives it to the Count. OTHO. He saves my journey—was it through the back? COUNT. No matter, if it reach the heart, which passage— This time it goes the other way. [He stabs Otho, and exit. NETHERSTEIN. Hold! hold! FERRYMAN. His kinsman, his confederate! NETHERSTEIN. Help me, Gregory! The sword went through him! FERRYMAN. Melchior, bring him back— Take the sword from him, Tycho! NETHERSTEIN. Here are weapons— Run, Bernard—get behind—run warily! FERRYMAN. Murder for pastime! NETHERSTEIN. Help us to the couch. RACHEL. The chamber here within, sirs—hold his head! NETHERSTEIN. His very breath is bloody—lift him gently. [Exeunt. (The Countess and Ferryman remain.) FERRYMAN. Gertrude, I bring thee misery yet again! I said those lips would curse me. What I do Is ruin to thee, but it must be done. I have no choice. Awake, and look upon me! I was content to die from all remembrance— Trusting my honor with forgetfulness— Rather than live and grieve thee. Both deceived, Let both forgive. I could not hide this murder! COUNTESS rises, and comes forward. And wherefore shouldst thou hide it? what afflicts thee? Thou didst not come the first to bring down ruin— 'Twas I proclaimed the murder and the murderer. Thank Heaven for that! the guilty fall together, And by each other—I the chief of them:— The cruel, the credulous! (Enter Catherine.) Come hither, child: Why dost thou tremble at my kinsman thus? CATHERINE. I dare not stay within to see him die! COUNTESS. I neither fear nor wonder—scarce discern, Amongst so many changes, life from death. The one we looked for yesterday is lost— The lost these seven years—he who fell by daylight— The registered as slain—the praised and mourned for— Is with us here! FERRYMAN. This should teach hope to both. COUNTESS. I hoped—no matter now what else I did! Proud hopes are seldom prosperous—never long. There is a sister left me—gentler, wiser— Though falsely, let me think she is my gift— That so, at last, I make a large amends— Let me bestow her—her portion equals thine— (She gives him the hand of Catherine.) The half of Rabensberg. FERRYMAN, Make her a gift— A happy gift—and not a legacy. Be sister to us both, for wanting this The rest were bare as winter. See, she kneels! (Catherine kneels.) Gertrude has power to make her cousin happy— But never if she part from him again. Behold, it is a promise! lead her hence. I have her hand and thine.—(Exeunt Countess and Catherine.) (Enter Netherstein and Rachel.) NETHERSTEIN. The youth is dead! This shall be taxed and answered. Why didst lend The sword to such a butchery? Lord of what? RACHEL. Who else is killed, didst say? My lady's brother? FERRYMAN. My brother and her cousin. RACHEL. Thou her brother? Why shouldst thou kill her cousin, knave?—Who art thou? FERRYMAN. The Baron Rabensberg. NETHERSTEIN. Colen a Baron! (Enter Tycho and Servants.) TYCHO. Thou shouldst have cast thy coxcomb off and helped. The Count is gone. FERRYMAN. Which way? TYCHO. To court, or that way— Eastward, Vienna-ward—down stream at bottom, And haply bottom upwards. RACHEL. Hush! art mad? TYCHO. Why not? the rest are so—Count, Countess, Colen. Why lift thy brows, in such a sort, above thee— And magnify thyself against me thus? FERRYMAN. He is not drowned? TYCHO. Then try thy luck again— See what canst do by diving? RACHEL. Sirrah, hush! TYCHO. Speak! speak!—hush! hush!—I will row leisurely. My lord was hard to catch, and ill to hold— His sword swung round about, like Godfrey's windmill. Tauss fain had got behind—he judged so much, Backed water, jumped aboard the ferry-boat— And cut the tow-rope short to set her free— At first, the current drifts him close in-shore An oar's length from us as we run down stream. And lo, that heavy Baron, by the helm, Sits stark and still, the foresail over him. By Haman's necklace, how this hallooed to him! TAUSS. And prayed to him! TYCHO. And swore at him! TAUSS. And shook him! TYCHO. And plucked the foresail from about his head!— The moon shone brightly on them:—we might see The dead man's eye-balls staring face to face! Quick ears had heard the live one shrieking here! He jumped—Tauss says he tumbled overboard— TAUSS. We ran beyond to mark his rising-place— The wherry got between us—Melchior saw him, Went bravely in, at once—but could not find him. His clothes were heavy. TYCHO. If he rose again, It was beneath the boat.—Some think he did it— He slew them both—the youth and Baron too! And partly I believe he did. NETHERSTEIN. Caps off! Colen himself is one! TYCHO. A what? NETHERSTEIN. A lord. TYCHO. So am I too—lend me the cloak, cock robin! Now that the play is over, strip thy bravery. RACHEL. Down on thy knees! FERRYMAN. His place is next my back By land, as well as water, mother-in-law— But let us two make fresher contracts now— Henceforth, as I am dutiful, be kind. He must live longer than I yet have done— Bear more, and travel farther—who shall find A sounder-hearted man than Netherstein— We will be merry yet, and that together. TYCHO. Who says so?—What art whispering, Bernard Brann? Do Baron-finders turn themselves to Barons As tadpoles change to frogs—by staring at them? A Baron's son and brother!—not a soldier? FERRYMAN. I was a soldier truly, as I said, Where all our buffets did not fall in front. One stopped and stunned me, ere aware of it. Ten times life parted—then came back again. My wits—which flew like bees whose hive is rifled, Afraid to light and enter—stooped at last. The surf of battle had run farther on— It swamped, and left me stranded. Round about Lay wrecks so broken that the shape of men Was almost lost in them. With one beside me, I changed mine arms and what might hurt by honouring— He got the better burial. Fields like these Have careful gleaners after death has reaped them, Who stoop to pick the weightiest straws the first. Of such I was aware in time—crept from them, And when night came, found help. NETHERSTEIN. But grieved thy friends, And lost thine heritage? FERRYMAN. I had none such. As far as honour went, the war was done. In this my life seemed luckier, ay, and longer Than his may chance to do who counts fourscore— I lived to hear it praised, so ended it: And, free to please myself, began another— Content with harmless mirth and peaceful bread. THE END.</field>
