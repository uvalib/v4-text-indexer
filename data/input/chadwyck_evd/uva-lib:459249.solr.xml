      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. As G?mer Gurton, with manye a wyde styche Sat pesynge &amp; patching of Hodgher m?s briche By chance or misfortune as shee her geare tost In Hodge lether bryches her needle shee lost, When Diccon the bedlem had hard by report That good G?mer Gurton was robde in thys sorte, He quyetly perswaded with her in that stound Dame Chat her deare gossyp this needle had found, Yet knew shee no more of this matter (alas) Then knoeth Tom our clarke what the Priest saith at masse Here of there ensued so fearfull a fraye, Mas Doctor was sent for these gossyps to staye, Because he was Curate, and estemed full wyse Who found that he sought not, by Diccons deuice, When all thinges were tombled and cleane out of fassion Whether it were by fortune, or some other constellacion Sodenlye the neele Hodge found by the prickynge And drew it out of his bottocke where he felt it stickynge Theyr hartes then at rest with perfect securytie, With a pot of good nale they stroake vp theyr plauditie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fyrst Acte. The fyrst Sceane. Diccon. Diccon Many a myle haue I walked, diners and sundry waies And many a good m?s house haue I bin at in my daies Many a gossips cup in my tyme haue I tasted And many a brache and spyt, haue I both turned and basted Many a peece of bacon haue I had out of thir balkes In ronnyng ouer the countrey, with long and were walkes, Yet came my foote neuer, within those doore cheekes, To seeke flesh or fysh, Garlyke, Onyons or Leekes, That euer I saw a sorte, in such a plyght As here within this house appereth to my syght, There is howlynge and scowlyng, all cast in adumpe, With whewling and pewling, as though they had lost a trump Syghing and sobbing, they weepe and they wayle I maruell in my mynd, what the deuill they ayle The olde Trot syts groning, with alas and alas, And Tib wringes her hands, and takes on in worse case With poore Cocke theyr boye, they be dryuen in such fyts I feare mee the folkes be not well in theyr wyts, Aske them what they ayle, or who brought them in this staye? They aunswer not at all, but alacke and welaway Whan I saw it booted not, out at doores I hyed mee And caught a slyp of Bacon, when I saw that none spyed mee, Which I intend not far hence, vnles my purpose fayle Shall serue for a shoinghorne to draw on two pots of ale. The second Sceane. Hodge. Diccon. Hodge See so cham arayed with dablynge in the durt She that set me to ditchinge, ich wold she had the squrt Was neuer poore soule that such a life had? Gogs bones thys vylthy glaye hase drest mee to bad Gods soule, see how this stuffe teares Iche were better to bee a Bearward and set to keepe Beares By the Masse here is a gasshe, a shamefull hole in deade And one stytch teare furder, a man may thruste in his heade. Diccon By my fathers soule Hodge, if I shulde now besworne I can not chuse but say thy breech is foule be torne, But the next remedye in such a case and hap Is to plaunche on a piece, as brode as thy cap. Hodge Gogs soule man, tis not yet two dayes fully ended Synce my dame Gurton (chem sure) these breches amended, But cham made suce a drudge to trudge at euery neede Chwold rend it though it were stitched what sturdy pacthreede, Diccon Hoge, let thy breeches go, and speake and tell mee soone What deuill ayleth g?mer gurton, &amp; Tib her mayd to frowne, Hodge Tush man thart deceyued, tys theyr dayly looke, They coure so ouer ye coles, theyr eyes be bleard with smooke, Diccon Nay by the masse, I perfectly perceiued as I came hether That eyther Tib &amp; her dame hath ben by the eares to gether Or els as great a matter as thou shalt shortly see. Hodge Now iche besceche our Lord they neuer better agree. Diccon By gogs soule there they syt as still as stones in the streite As though they had ben tak? with fairies or els wt some il sprite Hodge Gogs hart, I durst haue layd my cap to a crowne Chwould lerne of some prancome as sone as ich came to town. Diccon Why Hodge art thou inspyred? or dedst thou therof here? Hodge Nay, but ich saw such a wonder as ich saw nat this .vii. yere Tome Tannkards Cow (be gogs bones) she set me vp her saile And flynging about his halfe aker fysking with her taile, As though there had ben in her ars a swarme of Bees, And chad not cryed tphrowh hoore, shead lept out of his Lees. Diccon Why Hodg lies the connyng in Tom tankards cowes taile? Hodge Well ich chaue hard some say such tokens do not fayle, But cast yu not till in faith Diccon, why she frownes or wher at Hath no man stolne her Ducks or Henes, or gelded gyb her Cat Diccon What deuyll can I tell man, I cold not haue one word They gaue no more hede to my talk then thou woldst to a lorde Hodge Iche can not styll but muse, what meruaylous thinge it is Chyll in and know my selfe what matters are amys. Diccon. Then farewell hodge a while, synce thou doest inward hast, For I will into the good wyfe Chats, to feele how the ale dooth taste. The thyrd Sceane. Hodge. Tyb. Hodge Cham agast by the masse, ich wot not what to do Chad nede blesse me well before ich go them to Perchaunce some felon sprit may haunt our house indeed, And then chwere but at noddy to venter where cha no neede Tib, Cham worse then mad by the masse to be at this staye Cham chyd, cham blamd, and beaton all thoures on the daye, Lamed and hunger storued, prycked vp all in Iagges Hauyng no patch to hyde my backe, saue a few rotten ragges. Hodge I say Tyb, if thou be Tyb, as I trow sure thou bee, What deuyll make a doe is this, betweene our dame and thee. Tyb. Gogs breade Hodg thou had a good turne thou warte not here this whyle. It had ben better for some of vs to haue ben hence a myle My Gammer is so out of course, and frantyke all at ones That Cocke our boy, &amp; I poore wench, haue felt it on our bones. Hodge What is the matter, say on Tib wherat she taketh so on. Tyb. She is vndone she sayth (alas,) her ioye and life is gone If shee here not of some comfort, she is sayth but dead Shall neuer come within her lyps, one inch of meate ne bread. Hodge Byr Ladie cham not very glad, to see her in this dumpe Cholde a noble her stole hath fallen, &amp; shee hath broke her rumpe Tyb. Nay and that were the worst, we wold not greatly care For bursting of her huckle bone, or breakyng of her Chaire, But greatter, greater, is her grief, as hodge we shall all feele. Hodge Gogs woundes Tyb, my gammer has neuer lost her Neele? Tyb. Her Neele. Hodge Her Neele? Tib. Her neele by him that made me, it is true Hodge I tell thee. Hodge Gogs sacrament, I would she had lost, tharte out of her bellie The Deuill or els his dame, they ought her sure a shame How a murryon came this chaunce, (say Tib) vnto our dame? Tyb My g?mer sat her downe on her pes, &amp; bad me reach thy breeches And by &amp; by, a venge?ce in it or she had take two stitches To clap a clout vpon thine ars, by chaunce a syde she leares And gyb our cat in the milke pan, she spied ouer head and eares Ah hore, out thefe, she cryed aloud, &amp; swapt the breches downe Up went her staffe, and out leapt gyb, at doors into the towne And synce that time was neuer wyght, cold set their eies vp? it Gogs malison chaue Cocke and I, byd twenty times light on it. Hodge And is not th? my breches sewid vp, to morow yt I shuld were Tyb No in faith hodge thy breeches lie, for al this neuer the nere. Hodge Now a v?geance light on al ye sort, yt better shold haue kept it, The cat, the house, and tib our maid, yt better shold haue swept it Se where she c?meth crawling, come on in twenty deuils way Ye haue made a fayre daies worke, haue you not? pray you say. The .iiii. Sceane. Gammer. Hodge. Tyb. Cocke. G?mer A Las hoge, alas I may well cursse and ban This daie that euer I saw it, with gyb and the mylke pan For these and ill lucke to gather, as knoweth Cocke my boye Haue stacke away my deare neele, and robd me of my ioye My fayre longe strayght neele that was myne onely treasure The fyrst day of my sorow is, and last end of my pleasure. Hodge Might ha kept it when ye had it, but fooles will be fooles styll. Lose that is vast in your handes, ye neede not but ye will. G?mer Go hie thee tib, and run thou hoore, to thend here of the towne Didst cary out dust in thy lap, seeke wher thou porest it downe And as thou sawest me roking, in the asshes where I morned So see in all the heape of dust, thou leaue no straw vnturned. Tyb That chal gammer swythe and tyte, and sone be here agayne, G?mer Tib stoope &amp; loke downe to ye ground to it, &amp; take some paine. Hodge Here is a prety matter, to see this gere how it goes By gogs soule I thenk you wold loes your ars, and it were loose Your neele lost, it is pitie you shold lack care and endlesse sorow Gogs deth how shall my breches be sewid, shall I go thus to morow G?mer Ah hodg, hodg, if that ich cold find my neele by the reed Chould sow thy breches ich promise ye, wt full good double threed And set a patch on either knee, shuld last this monethes twaine Now god &amp; good Saint Sithe I praye, to send it home againe. Hodge Wherto serued your hands &amp; eies, but this your neele to kepe What deuill had you els to do, ye kept ich wot no sheepe Cham faine a brode to dyg and delue, in water, myre and claye Sossing and possing in the durte, styll from day to daye A hundred thinges that be abrode, cham set to see them weele And foure of you syt idle at home, and can not keepe a neele. G?mer My neele alas ich lost it hodge, what time ich me vp hasted To saue the milke set vp for the, which gib our cat hath wasted Hodge The Deuill he burst both gib, and Tib, with all the rest Cham alwayes sure of the worst end, who euer haue the best Where ha you ben fidging abrode, since you your neele lost G?mer Within the house, and at the dore, sitting by this same post Wher I was loking a long howre, before these folks came here, But welaway, all was in vayne, my neele is neuer the nere. Hodge Set me a candle, let me seeke and grope where euer it bee Gogs hart ye be so folish (ich thinke) you knowe it not when you it see G?mer Come hether Cocke, what Cocke I say. Cocke. Howe Gammer. G?mer Goe hye thee soone, and grope behynd the old brasse pan, Whych thing when thou hast done Ther shalt thou fynd an old shooe, wher in if thou looke well Thou shalt fynd lyeng an inche of a whyte tallow candell, Lyght it, and brynge it tite awaye. Cocke. That shalbe done anone. G?mer Nay tary hodg til thou hast light, and then weele seke ech one. Hodge Cum away ye horson boy, are ye a slepe: ye must haue a crier. Cocke. Ich cannot get the candel light here is almost no fier. Hodge Chil hold the a peny chil make ye come if yt ich may catch thine eares Art deffe thou horson boy? cocke I say, why canst not heares. G?mer Beate hym not Hodge but help the boy and come you two together. The .v. Sceane. Gammer. Tyb, Cocke. Hodge. G?mer How now Tyb, quycke lets here, what newes thou hast brought hether. Tyb. Chaue tost and tumbled yender heap our &amp; ouer againe And winowed it through my fingers, as m? wold winow grain Not so much as a hens turd but in pieces I tare it Or what so euer clod or clay I found, I did not spare it Lokyng within and eke without, to fynd your neele (alas) But all in vaine and without help, your neele is where it was.

Mary syr euen this, The tale I tolde before, the selfe same tale it was his, He gaue me like a frende, warning against my losse, Els had my hens be stolne, eche one, by Gods crosse: He tolde me Hodge wold come, and in he came indeede, But as the matter chaunsed, with greater hast then speede, This truth was said, and true was found, as truly I report. Bayly. If Doctor Rat be not deceiued, it was of another sort. D. Rat. By Gods mother thou and he, be a cople of suttle foxes, Betweene you and Hodge, I beare away the boxes, Did not dicc? apoynt the place, wher yu shuldst st?d to mete him. Chat. Yes by the masse, &amp; if he came, bad me not sticke to speet hym. D. Rat. Gods sacrament the villain knaue hath drest vs round about, He is the cause of all this brawle, that dyrty shitten loute: When gammer gurton here complained, &amp; made a ruful mone I heard him sweare yt you had gotten, hir nedle that was gone, And this to try he furder said, he was ful loth how be it He was content with small adoe, to bring me where to see it. And where ye sat, he said ful certain, if I wold folow his read Into your house a priuy way, he wold me guide and leade, And where ye had it in your hands, sewing about a clowte, And set me in the backe hole, therby to finde you out: And whiles I sought a quietnes, creping vpon my knees, I found the weight of your dore bar, for my reward and fees, Such is the lucke that some men gets, while they begin to mel In setting at one such as were out, minding to make al wel. Hodge Was not wel blest g?mer, to scape ye scoure, &amp; chad ben there Th? chad ben drest be like, as ill by the masse, as gaffar vicar. Bayly. Mary sir, here is a sport alone, I loked for such an end If diccon had not playd the knaue, this had ben sone amend My gammer here he made a foole, and drest hir as she was And goodwife Chat he set to scole, till both partes cried alas, And D. Rat was not behind, whiles Chat his crown did pare, I wold the knaue had b? starke blind, if hodg had not his share. Hodge Cham meetly wel sped alredy amongs, cham drest like a coult And chad not had the better wit, chad bene made a doult. Bayly. Sir knaue make hast diccon were here, fetch him where euer he bee Chat. Fie on the villaine, fie, fie, yt makes vs thus agree, G?mer Fie on him knaue, with al my hart, now fie, and fie againe. D. Rat. Now fie on him may I best say, whom he hath almost slaine. Bayly. Lo where he commeth at hand, belike he was not fare Diccon heare be two or three, thy company can not spare. Diccon God blesse you, and you may be blest so many al at once Chat. Come knaue, it were a good deed to geld the by cockes bones Seest not thy handiwarke? sir Rat can ye forbeare him? Diccon A v?geance on those hands lite, for my h?ds cam not nere hym The horsen priest hath lift the pot, in some of these alewyues chayres That his head wolde not serue him, belyke to come downe the stayres. Baily. Nay soft, thou maist not play ye knaue, &amp; haue this language to If thou thy tong bridle a while, the better maist thou do, Confesse the truth as I shall aske, and cease a while to fable. And for thy fault I promise the, thy handling shalbe reasonable Hast thou not made a lie or two, to set these two by the eares? Diccon What if I haue? fiue hundred such haue I seene within these seuen yeares: I am sory for nothing else but that I see not the sport Which was betwene them wh? they met, as they th? selues report Bayly. The greatest thing master rat, ye se how he is drest. Diccon. What deuil nede he be groping so depe, in goodwife Chats h?s nest Bayly. Yea but it was thy drift to bring him into ye briars. Diccon. Gods bread, hath not such an old foole, wit to saue his eares? He showeth himselfe herein ye see, so very a coxe, The Cat was not so madly alured by the Foxe, To run into the snares, was set for him doubtlesse, For he leapt in for myce, and this sir Iohn for madnes. D. Rat. Well and ye shift no better, ye losel, lyther, and lasye, I will go neare for this, to make ye leape at a Dasye. In the kings name master Bayly, I charge you set him fast. Diccon. What fast at cardes, or fast on slepe? it is the thing I did last. D. Rat. Nay fast in fetters false varlet, according to thy deedes. Bayly. Master doctor ther is no remedy, I must intreat you needes Some other kinde of punishment, D. Rat. Nay by all Halowes. His punishm?t if I may iudg, shalbe naught els but the gallous. Bayly. That were to sore, a spiritual man to be so extreame. D. Rat. Is he worthy any better, sir how do ye iudge and deame? Bayly. I graunt him wortie punishment, but in no wise so great. G?mer It is a shame ich tel you plaine, for such false knaues intreat He has almost vndone vs al, that is as true as steele: And yet for al this great a do, cham neuer the nere my neele. Bayly. Canst yu not say any thing to that diccon, with least or most? Diccon Yea mary sir, thus much I can say wel, the nedle is lost. Bayly. Nay canst not thou tel which way, that nedle may be found Diccon No by my fay sir. though I might haue an hundred pound. Hodge Thou lier lickdish, didst not say the neele wold be gitten? Diccon No hodge, by the same token, you where that time beshitten? For feare of Hobgobling, you wot wel what I meane, As long as it is sence, I feare me yet ye be scarce cleane. Bayly. Wel master rat, you must both learne, &amp; teach vs to forgeue Since Diccon hath confession made, &amp; is so cleane shreue, If ye to me conscent, to amend this heauie chaunce. I wil inioyne him here, some open kind of penaunce: Of this condition, where ye know my fee is twenty pence For the bloodshed, I am agreed with you here to dispence, Ye shal go quite, so that ye graunt, the matter now to run, To end with mirth emong vs al, euen as it was begun. Chat. Say yea master vicar, &amp; he shal sure confes to be your detter And al we that be heare present, wil loue you much the better D. Rat. My part is the worst, but since you al here on agree. Go euen to master Bayly, let it be so for mee, Bayly. How saiest thou diccon, art content this shal on me depend Diccon Go to M. Bayly say on your mind, I know ye are my frend? Bayly. Then marke ye wel, to recompence this thy former action Because thou hast offended al, to make them satisfaction, Before their faces, here kneele downe, &amp; as I shal the teach. For thou shalt take on othe, of hodges leather breache First for master Doctor, vpon paine of his cursse, Where he wil pay for al, thou neuer draw thy pursse, And when ye meete at one pot, he shall haue the first pull, And thou shalt neuer offer him the cup, but it be full. To goodwife chat thou shalt be sworne, euen on the same wyse If she refuse thy money once, neuer to offer it twise. Thou shalt be bound by the same here, as thou dost take it When thou maist drinke of free cost, thou neuer forsake it: For gammer gurtons sake, againe sworne shalt thou bee To helpe hir to hir nedle againe if it do lie in thee And likewise be bound: by the vertue of that To be of good abering to Gib hir great Cat: Last of al for Hodge, the othe to scanne, Thou shalt neuer take him, for fine gentleman. Hodge Come on fellow Diccon chalbe euen with thee now. Bayly Thou wilt not sticke to do this Diccon I trow. Diccon No by my fathers skin, my hand downe I lay it? Loke as I haue promised, I wil not denay it, But Hodge take good heede now, thou do not beshite me. And gaue him a good blow on the buttocke. Hodge Gogs hart thou false villaine dost thou bite me?

By my troth Gossyp gurton, I am euen as glad As though I mine owne selfe as good a turne had: Bayly. And I by my concience, to see it so come forth, Reioyce so much at it, as three nedles be worth. D. Rat. I am no whit sory to see you so reioyce. Diccon Nor I much the gladder for al this noyce: Yet say gramercy Diccon, for springing of the game. G?mer Gramercy Diccon twenty times, o how glad cham, If that chould do so much, your masterdome to come hether, Master Rat, goodwise Chat, and Diccon together: Cha but one halfpeny, as far as iche know it, And chil not rest this night, till ich bestow it.

Diccon Soft syrs, take vs with you, the company shalbe the more, As proude coms behinde they say, as any goes before, But now my good masters since we must be gone And leaue you behinde vs, here all alone: Since at our last ending, thus mery we bee, For Gammer Gurtons nedle sake, let vs haue a plaudytie.
