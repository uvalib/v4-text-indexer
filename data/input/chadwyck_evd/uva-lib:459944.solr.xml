      <field name="fulltext">ACT the First. SCENE, a Hall, Old Capulet and Paris discovered. Old Capulet. My good Lord Paris, welcome to Verona, The Blood that richly warms your youthful Veins, Being so near ally'd to Royal Escalus, (Our honour'd Prince) not more endears you to us, Than do the Virtues of your noble Heart, Which add a brighter Lustre to your Titles; And challenge the Respect of all good Men. Paris. Lord Capulet, whatever I possess Of Wealth, or Titles, is the Stroke of Chance; Thank Fortune for 'em; but, on those I build not: Be it my Endeavour then to engraft from you, Upon my Mind your full-grown Worth and Knowledge, E'er I presume to ask, fair Juliet's Love. O. Cap. Your Merit, Sir, is riper than her Years; Tho' Girls are forward ripe in Italy, At Fourteen, Sir, to make my Child a Mother, Wou'd Grandsire me too soon; besides my Lady Wishes not yet to be a Grandmother:â We must be cautious how we cross the Women, Or fear to lead uncomfortable Lives. Montague, the ancient Enemy of our House, Thinking our Power greater, Sir, than his, Wish'd his Son Romeo, and our Daughter, married; Which so increas'd the Anger of our Wives, (Whose Quarrels we are ever apt to join in) The Rage of civil War, broke out more fiercely; And may prove fatal to his House or mine. Par. Young Romeo is a Man whom most admire, And therefore to be fear'd: Say, may I hope He has no Impression made on Juliet's Heart. O. Cap. None on my LifeâShe knows not what is Love; Unless to love her Father, Mother, Kinsmen: There her Affection's strong. So fear not him. [A Noise is heard without of Fighting; and crying, Down with the Montague's, down with the Capulets, &amp;c. What Noise is that?âBring me my Rapier there. Paris. Sir, be advis'd; think not to stir Abroad, Till I have found the Prince; whose Presence, only, Can quell these madding Riots. [Exit Paris. O. Cap. Bring me my Sword. Enter Lady Capulet. L. Cap. Bring you a Crutch!âI pray you stay within; And let the Roisters quarrel by themselves: 'Tis but our Servants. O. Cap. I'll have my Sword: Hear I not Montague? I know his Voice; therefore, I say, away; He flourishes his Blade in Scorn of me. [Exit O. Cap. L. Cap. Lock the Gates there; let not your Master forth. [L. Cap. follows. SCENE, the Street. The Servants of the Capulets and Montague's appear engaged with Swords, Slaves, &amp;c. To them Benvolio and Tybalt. Old Montague and Capulet meeting. Enter Prince and Attendants. Prin. Rebellious Subjects! Enemies to Peace; That quench the Fire of your pernicious Rage, With Purple-Fountains issuing from your Veins; On Pain of Death, sheath your mistemper'd Blades, And hear the Sentence of your moved Prince. Three civil Broils, bred of an airy Word, By thee Old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturb'd the Quiet of our Streets, And made Verona's ancient Citizens, Cast by their grave beseeming Ornaments. If ever you disturb our Streets again, Your Lives shall pay the Forfeit of your Peace. You, Capulet, shall go along with me; And Montague, come you this Afternoon, To know our farther Pleasure in this Case. On Pain of Death, let every Man depart. [Exit Prince and Attendance. Remain Lord Montague, and Benvolio. Mont. Who set this ancient Quarrel new abroach? Speak, Nephew, were you by when it began?â Benv. Here were the Servants of your Adversary, And yours, close fighting, e'er I did approach; I drew to part 'em: In the Instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his Sword prepar'd, Which, as he breath'd Defiance to my Ears, He swung about his Head, and cut the Winds; While we were interchanging Thrusts and Blows, Came more, and more, and fought on Part and Part, Till the Prince came. O. Mon. Where is Romeo? Benv. My Lord, an Hour before the worshipp'd Sun Peep'd thro' the golden Window of the East, A troubled Mind drew me from Company; When, underneath a Grove of Sycamour, That Westward rooteth from this City Side, So early walking did I see your Son; Towards him I made, but he was 'ware of me, And stole into the Covert of the Wood; I measuring his Affections by my own, Which most are busied, when they are left alone, Pursued my Humour; not pursuing his: And gladly shun'd, who gladly fled from me. Mount. Many a Morning hath he there been seen, With Tears augmenting the fresh Morning Dew; But all so soon as the all-chearing Sun, Should, in the farthest East, begin to draw The shady Curtains from Aurora's Bed; Away from Light steals home my heavy Son: And private, in his Chamber, pens himself; Shuts up his Windows; looks fair Day-light out; And makes himself an artificial Night. Black and portentous, must this Humour prove, Unless good Counsel may the Cause remove. Benv. My noble Uncle, do you know the Cause? Mount. I neither know it, nor can learn it of him. Benv. Have you importun'd him by any means? Mount. Both by my self, and many other Friends: But he, his own Affection's Counsellor, Is to himself (I will not say how true) But to himself so secret and so close; So far from Sounding and Discovery; As is the Bud bit with an envious Worm, Ere he can spread his sweet Leaves to the Air, Or dedicate his Beauty to the Sun. Wou'd I cou'd learn from whence his Sorrows grow! Benv. See, where he comes: So please you step aside. I'll try to learn his Grievance. Mount. Would thou may'st be so happy: I'll retire. [Exit Moun. Enter Romeo. Benv. Good-Morrow, Cousin. Rom. Is the Day so young? Benv. But now struck Nine. Rom. Alas! sad Hours seem long! Was that my Father, that went hence but now? Benv. It was. What Sadness lengthens Romeo's Hours? Rom. Not having that, which had, would make them short. Benv. Are you in Love, good Cousin? Rom. Say I were, Were it a Wonder, Cousin? Benv. Returns the Fair-one, Love? Rom. I would she did! Benv. Alas! that Love, so gentle to our View, Should often prove so harsh and tyrannous. Rom. Pri'thee no more; thou wilt but laugh at me. Benv. No, Coz. I rather weep. Rom. Good Heart, at what? Benv. At thy good Heart's Oppression. Rom. The friendly Love, Benvolio, thou hast shewn, Doth add more Grief to too much of mine own. Love is a Smoke, rais'd with the Fume of Sighs; Being purg'd, a Fire sparkling in Lover's Eyes: Being vex'd, a Sea nourish'd with Lovers Tears. What is it else? A Madness most discreet; A choaking Gall, and a preserving Sweet. Farewel. Benv. Let me go with you; for if you leave me thus, you do me wrong. Rom. But I am lost, or am no more my self; Think not this Romeo, whom you see before you. Benv. Tell me, in Sadness, who she is you love? Rom. In Sadness, Cousin, I do love a Woman. Benv. I aim'd so near, when I suppos'd you lov'd. Rom. A right good Marksman;âand she's fair I love. Benv. A right fair Mark, good Coz, is soonest hit. Rom. Cousin, therein you miss;âShe'll not be hit, With Cupid's Arrow; she hath Diana's Wit; And in strong Proof of Chastity well arm'd, From Love's weak childish Bow, she lives unharm'd: She will not stay the Siege of loving Terms, Nor 'bide th'Encounter of assailing Eyes, Nor ope her Lap to Saint-seducing Gold; O! she is rich in Beauty; only poor, That when she dies; with her dies Beauty's Store. Benv. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste. Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste. For Beauty starv'd by her Severity, Cuts Beauty off from all Posterity. Benv. Be rul'd by me: Forget to think of her. Rom. First, teach me how I should forget to think. Benv. By giving Liberty unto thy Eyes: Examine other Beauties. Rom. 'Tis the way To call her's [exquisite] in Question more. He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious Treasure of his Eye-sight lost, Shew me a Mistress that is passing fair, What doth her Beauty serve, but as a Note, Where I may read, who still surpasses her! Enter Old Mountague. Mount. Upon thy Duty, Romeo, make my Ear No more a Stranger to thy sickly Thoughts; But, do not let me think, what much I dread, That the young callow Chit, whom I once deign'd, To ask of Capulet, Romeo, for thy Bed, Has caught thy Eye; and, thro' thy Eye, thy Heart: No, Juliet is not for thee.âSighs thou, Boy? At that, unlucky Name, thou changest Colour; Thy Looks fix'd, as if thy Fate had seiz'd thee. Rom. Why nam'd you Juliet? Would she had ne'er been born, Or any one but Capulet had got her! Mount. Forget her, Sir, if you regard my Blessing. Rom. Forget her! Oh! she has Beauty might ensnare A Conqueror's Soul, and make him leave his Crown At random, to be shuffled for by Slaves. Oh! Juliet, there is Musick in thy Name, That soft'ning me to Infant Tenderness, Makes my Heart spring, like the first Leaps of Life. Mount. Then, thou art lost; if thou'rt a Man, my Son, If thou hast Virtue in thee, or can'st prize Thy Father's Honour, scorn her like a Slave: Hell! love her! Damn her! She's a Capulet. Learn then to hate her. Rom. 'Tis impossible. Who can behold, and hate her? Is she not As harmless as the Turtles of the Woods? Fair as the Summer Beauty of the Fields? As op'ning Flow'rs untainted yet with Winds? The Pride of Nature, and the Joy of Sense? Why first did you bewitch me else to Weakness? When from the Vespers as we came together, And as by her's our Chariot drove along, These were your Words: That, Romeo, that is she, That must give Happiness to thee, and me. Confirming in thy Arms the wish'd for Peace Betwixt their ancient Family and mine. Mount. Then she was charming. Rom. Oh! I found her so. I look'd and gaz'd, and never miss'd my Heart, It fled so pleasingly away: But now, My Soul is all fair Juliet's: Now she's fix'd Firm in my Heart, by secret Vows made there; Th'indelible Records of faithful Love. You'd have me hate her. Can my Nature change Create me o'er againâand I may be That haughty Master of myself you'd have me But as I am, the Slave of strong Desires, That keep me struggling under; tho' I see, The hopeless State of my unhappy Love With Torment; like a stubborn Slave that lies Chain'd to the Floor, stretch'd helpless on his Back, I look to Liberty, and break my Heart. Mount. No more, fond Boy, I'll have her nam'd no more. When next thou name her, let it be with Infamy: Tell me she has whor'd, or fled her Father's House, With some coarse Slave, t' a secret Cell of Lust; And then, I'll bless theeâ [Exit Mountague, and Benvolio. Rom. I shall obey. Saints from your Skies look down, And find like me one wretched, if you can. No, I will speak that hateful Name no more, But be as curs'd as he can wish his Son. [Exit. SCENE, a handsome Apartment in Capulet's House. Enter Capulet, Paris, and Servants. Cap. Lord Mountague is bound, as well as I, In Penalty alike; and 'tis not hard For Men so old as we to keep the Peace. Paris. Of honourable Reck'ning are you both, And pity 'tis you liv'd at Odds so long: But, now my Lord, what say you to my Suit? Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before; My Child is yet a Stranger in the World; She hath not seen the Change of fourteen Years: Let two more Summers wither in their Pride, Ere we may think her ripe to be a Bride. Paris. Younger than she are happy Mothers made. Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made; The Earth hath swallow'd all my Hopes; but she.â Yonder's my Lady, whom I have intreated To sound my Juliet on this purpos'd Match; Women best understand each other's Minds. Let us leave her to work upon my Daughter. Then woo her gentle Paris, get her Heart; My Will to her Consent is but a Part. If she agree, within her Scope of Choice, Lies my Consent, and fair-according Voice. [Exeunt. Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse. L. Cap. Nurse, where's my Daughter? Call her forth to me. Nurse. Now by my Maiden-head (at twelve Years old I had one) I'll bid her come. What Lamb! What Lady-Bird! God forbidâWhere's this Girl? What Juliet! Enter Juliet. Jul. How now, who calls? Nurse. Your Mother. Jul. Madam, I am here, what is your Will? L. Cap. This is the Matter. Nurse, give leave a while; We must talk in Secret:âNurse, come back again; I have remember'd me: Thou shalt hear my Counsel: Thou know'st my Daughter's of a pretty Age. Nurse. Faith I can tell her Age to an Hour. L. Cap. She's but fifteen. Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my Teeth, and yet to my Teeth be it spoken, I have but four;â She's not fourteen! How long is it now to Lammas-Tide? L. Cap. A Fortnight and odd Days. Nurse. Even or odd, of all the Days in the Year, come Lammas-Eve at Night shall she be fifteen; 'tis since the Earthquake now twelve Years, and she was wean'd; I never shall forget it of all the Days in the Year. And then she cou'd stand alone! Nay by the Rood, she cou'd have run, and waddled all about: For even the Day before, she broke her Brow, and then, my Husband (Peace be with his Soul, he was a merry Man) took up the Child; yea, quoth he, dost thou fall upon thy Face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more Wit, wilt thou not, Jule? And by my holy Dame, the pretty Wench left crying, and said aye! To see now how a Jest shou'd come about,â I warrant, an I shou'd live a thousand Years. I shou'd not forget it, wilt thou not Jule, quoth he? and, pretty Fool! It stinted, and said, aye! L. Cap. Enough of this: I prithee hold thy Peace. Nurse. Well, I have done; Heaven mark thee to his Grace:âThou wert the prettiest Babe that e'er I nurs'd. An I might live to see thee married once, I have my Wish. L. Cap. And that same Marriage is the very Theam, I came to talk of: Tell me, Daughter Juliet, how stands your Disposition to be married? Juliet. It is an Honour that I dream not of. Nurse. An Honour! Were not I thy only Nurse, I'd say thou had'st suck'd Wisdom from thy Teat: An Honour! Eh! L. Cap. Well, think of Marriage now; younger than you Here in Verona, Ladies of Esteem, Are made already Mothers: By my 'count, I was your Mother much upon these Years, That you are now a Maid. Thus then, in brief; The valiant Paris seeks you for his Love. Nurse. A Man, young LadyâAh! Lady, such a Man, As all the World!âWhy he's a Man of Wax. L. Cap. Verona's Summer hath not such a Flower. Nurse. Nay, he is a Flower; in faith, a very Flower. L. Cap. Speak briefly; can you like of Paris' Love? Juliet. If Happiness be seated in Content, Or that my being bless'd can make you so, Let me implore it on my Knees; I am Your only Child; and still, through all the Course Of my past Life, have been obedient too: And, as you've ever been a loving Parent, And bred me up with watchful tenderest Care, Which never cost me hitherto a Tear, Name not that Paris any more: Indeed! I cannot love him. L. Cap. Why? Juliet. Indeed I cannot, L. Cap. Oh early Disobedience! Debauch'd already to her Sex's Folly; Perverseness, and untoward head-strong Will. Juliet. Think me not so; I gladly shall submit to any Thing, nay, must submit to all; Yet think a little, e'er you fell my Peace: The Rites of Marriage are of mighty Moment; And shou'd you violate a Thing so sacred, Into a lawful Rape, and load my Soul, With hateful Bonds, which never can grow easy: How miserable am I like to be! L. Cap. Has then some other taken up your heart, And banish'd Duty, as an Exile, thence? What sensual lewd Companion of the Night, Have you been holding Conversation with, From open Window, at a midnight Hour, When wanton Wishes wou'd not let you sleep? Juliet. If I should love, is that a Fault, in one So young as I? I cannot guess the Cause,â But, when you first nam'd Paris for my Love, My Heart shrunk back, as you had done it wrong. L. Cap. No more of this; 'twill make thy Father mad: If thou art mine, resolve upon Compliance, Or think no more to rest beneath my Roofs. Juliet. Will you then quite cast off your once loved Juliet? And turn me like a Vagrant out of Doors, To wander up and down Verona's Streets; And beg my Bread with Sorrow? Can I bear The proud and hard Revilings of a slave, Fat with his Master's Plenty, when I ask A little Pity for my pinching Wants? Shall I endure the cold, wet windy Night, To seek a Shelter under dropping Eves, A Porch my Bed, a Threshold for my Pillow, Shiv'ring and starved, for want of Warmth and Food, Swell'd with my Sighs, and almost choak'd with Tears? Must I, at the uncharitable Gates, Of proud great Men implore Relief in vain? Must I bear all this? Because I am not Mistress of my Heart, Or cannot love according to your liking? L. Cap. Graze where thou wilt, but think no more of me, Till thy Obedience welcome thy Return. [Exit. Juliet. Alas! That ever Heaven shou'd practise Stratagems, Upon so soft a Subject as myself! What say'st thou? Hast thou not a Word of Joy? Some Comfort Nurse in this Extremity. Nurse. Marry, and there's but need on't: Odds my Life, Well Romeo is a Man, and so is Paris; Ah! But Romeo's Lip! And then Paris's Nose and Forehead! But then Romeo's Eye again; how it will sparkle, and twinkle, and trowl and leer! But to see Romeo on Horseback! But to see Paris walk or dance! such a Leg, such a Foot! Then Romeo's Shape, and Motion; Ah! Well Romeo's the Man, must be the Man, and shall be the Man. Juliet. He's by his Father's Nature rough and fierce, And knows not yet the Follies of my Love; And when he does, perhaps, may scorn and hate me. Nurse. Ah never fear it, he's a sweet young Man, and thou shalt have himâne'er pine nor teize thy pretty Heart about it.âWhat! I have been thy Nurse these fourteen Years, and I shou'd know what's good for thee. Juliet. I prithee! Leave me to myself awhile. [Exit Nurse. 'Tis hardly yet within two Hours of Day: I'll to my Window which o'erhangs the Garden. Behold the Queen of Night Shines fair, with all her virgin Stars about her, Not one amongst 'em all a Friend to Juliet; Yet, by their Course a while I'll guide my Steps, And think what Course, my wretched State must take. Oh! Romeo! Romeo! The all-seeing Sun Ne'er saw thy Equal since the World begun, [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE, a Garden. Enter Romeo alone. How vainly have I spent this idle Night! Even Wine can't heal the Raging of my Love. This sure shou'd be the Mansion of fair Juliet, For in such Groves the Deities first dwelt. Can I grow forward, when my heart is here? Turn back dull Earth and find thy Centre out. [Juliet appears at her Window. But soft! what Light thro' yonder Window breaks? It is the East, and Juliet is the Sun! She seems to hang upon the Cheek of Night, Fairer than Snow upon a Raven's Back; Brighter than Brilliants in an Ãthiop's Ear. Were she in yonder Sphere she'd shine so bright, The Birds wou'd sing, and think the Day were breaking. See, how she leans her Cheek upon her Hand! Oh! that I were a Glove upon that Hand, That I might touch that Cheek! Juliet. Ah! me. Romeo. She speaks! Ah! speak again, bright Angel, for thou art As glorious to this Night, being o'er my Head, As is a winged Messenger from Heaven, Unto the white up-turned wand'ring Eyes Of Mortals, that fall back to gaze on him, When he bestrides the lazy-pacing Clouds, And sails upon the Bosom of the Air. Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo! Deny thy Father, and refuse thy Name: Or, if thou wilt not,âbe but sworn my Love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet. Rom. Shall I hear this, and yet keep Silence? [Aside. Jul. 'Tis but thy Name that is my Enemy: What's in a Name? That which we call a Rose, By any other Name wou'd smell as sweet; So Romeo wou'd, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear Perfection which he owes, Without that Title; Romeo, quit thy Name; And for that Name, which is no Part of thee, Take all my self. Rom. I take thee at thy Word: Call me but thine, and Joys will so transport me, I shall forget myself, and quite be chang'd. Jul. What Man art thou, that thus bescreen'd in Night, So stumblest on my Counsel? Romeo. By a Name I know not how to tell thee who I am: My Name, dear Saint, is hateful to myself, Because it is an Enemy to thee. Juliet. Art thou not Romeo, and a Mountague? Rom. Neither, fair Saint, if either thee displease. Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The Orchard Walls are high, and hard to climb, And the Place Death, considering who thou art, If any of my Kinsmen find thee here. Rom. With Love's light Wings did I o'erperch these Walls, For stony Limits cannot hold Love out: Thy angry Kinsmen are no Stop to me. Jul. If they do see thee, they will murder thee. Rom. Alas! there lies more Peril in thine Eye, Than twenty of their Swords; look thou but kind, And I am Proof against their Enmity. Jul. I wou'd not for the World they saw thee here. Rom. I have Night's Cloak to hide me from their Eyes, And, but thou love me, let them find me here; My Life were better ended, by their Hate, Than Death prorogued, wanting of thy Love. Jul. By whose Direction found'st thou out this Place? Rom. By Love, that first did prompt me to enquire; He lent me Counsel, and I lent him Eyes: I am no Pilot, yet wer't thou as far As that vast Shore, wash'd with the farthest Sea, I wou'd adventure for such Merchandise. Jul. Thou know'st the Mask of Night is on my Face, Else wou'd a Maiden-Blush bepaint my Cheek, For that which thou hast heard me speak To-night. Fain wou'd I dwell on Form; fain, fain deny What I have spokeâBut, farewell, Compliment! Do'st thou love me? I know thou wilt say Aye; And I will take thy WordâYet if thou swear'st, Thou may'st prove falseâat Lover's Perjuries, They say, Jove laughs. Oh! gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: Or if you think I am too quickly won, I'll frown and be perverse, and say thee Nay, So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the World. In Truth, sweet Mountague, I am too fond; And therefore thou may'st think my 'Haviour light: But trust me, Gentleman, I'll prove more true, Than those that have more cunning to be strange, I shou'd have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheard'st, ere I was 'ware, My true Love's Passion; therefore pardon me, And not impute this yielding to light Love, Which the dark Night hath so discover'd. Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed Moon I vow, That tips with Silver all these Fruit-Tree Topsâ Jul. Oh! swear not by the Moon, th'inconstant Moon, That monthly changes in her circled Orb; Lest that thy Love prove likewise variable. Rom. What shall I swear by? Jul. Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Who art the God of my Idolatry, And I'll believe thee. Rom. If my Heart's true Loveâ Jul. Well, do not swearâaltho' I joy in thee, I have no Joy of this Contract To-night; It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden, Too like the Light'ning, which doth cease to be, Ere one can say it lightensâSweet, Good-night. This Bud of Love, by Summer's rip'ning Breath, May prove a beauteous Flower, when next we meet. Good-night, Good-night,âas sweet Repose and Rest Come to thy Heart, as that within my Breast! Rom. Why wilt thou leave me so unsatisfy'd? Jul. What Satisfaction canst thou have To-night? Rom. The Exchange of thy Love's faithful Vow for mine. Jul. I gave thee mine before thou did'st request it: And yet I wish it were to give again. Romeo. Wou'dst thou withdraw it? for what Purpose, Love? Jul. But to be frank, and give it thee again. My Bounty is as boundless as the Sea, My Love as deep; the more I give to thee, The more I have; for both are Infinite. I hear some Noise within; dear Love, adieu. [Nurse within. What Juliet! Child! Anon, good NurseâSweet Mountague be true: Stay but a little, I will come again. [Exit. Rom. O blessed! blessed Night! I am afraid, All this is but a Dream I hear, and see; Too flattering sweet to be substantial. Re-enter Juliet above. Jul. Three Words, dear Romeo, and Good-night indeed: If that thy Bent of Love be honourable, Thy Purpose Marriage, send me word To-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee; Where, and what Time thou wilt perform the Rite, And all my Fortunes at thy Foot I'll lay, And follow thee, my Love, throughout the World. [Within. Madam. I come anonâBut if thou mean'st not wellâ I do beseech theeâ[Within. Madam.] by and by I come, To cease thy Suit, and leave me to my Grief. To-morrow I will send. Rom. So thrive my Soul. Jul. A thousand times Good-night. [Exit Juliet. Rom. Ten thousand Blessings wait thy Innocence. [Exit Romeo. Re-enter Juliet above. Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O! for a Falkner's Voice, To lure this Tassel gentle back againâ Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud, Else wou'd I tear the Cave where Eccho lies, And make her airy Tongue more hoarse than mine, With Repetition of my Romeo. Romeo returns. Rom. It is my Love that calls upon my Name; How Silver-sweet sound Lovers Tongues by Night, Like softest Musick to attending Ears! Jul. Romeo! Rom. My sweet! Jul. At what o'Clock To-morrow, Shall I send to thee? Rom. By the Hour of Nine. Jul. I will not fail; 'tis twenty Years till thenâ I have forgot why I did call thee back. Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it. Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there; Rememb'ring how I love thy Company. Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget; Forgetting any other Home but this. Jul. 'Tis almost Morning. I would have thee gone, And yet no farther than a Wanton's Bird, That lets it hop a little from her Hand, Like a poor Pris'ner in his twisted Gyves, And with a Silk-Thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his Liberty. Rom. I wou'd I were thy Bird. Jul. Sweet, so wou'd I; Yet I shou'd kill thee with too much cherishing. Good-night, Good-night:âParting is such sweet Sorrow, That I shall say Good-night till it be Morrow. [Exit. Rom. To-morrow, 'tis no longer; but Desires are swift, And longing Love wou'd lavish Time: To-morrow! Oh! To-morrow! till that come The tedious Hours move heavily away, And each long Minute is a lazy Day. [Exit. SCENE, a Wood near a Monastery. Enter Friar Laurence, with a Basket. Fri. The grey-ey'd Morn smiles on the frowning Night, Check'ring the Eastern Clouds with Streaks of Light. Now, ere the Sun advance his burning Eye, The Day to cheer, and Night's dank Dew to dry, I must fill up this Osier Cage of ours, With baleful Weeds, and precious juicy Flowers. Mighty is the powerful Grace that lies In Herbs, Trees, Stones, and their true Qualities: For nought so vile that on the Earth doth live, But to the Earth some special Good doth give: Nor ought so good, but strain'd from that fair Use, Revolts to Vice, and stumbles on Abuse. Enter Romeo. Rom. Good-morrow, Father. Fri. Benedicite! What early Tongue so sweet salutes my Ear? Young Son, it argues a distemper'd Head, So soon to bid Good-morrow; Care keeps his Watch in every old Man's Eye, And where Care lodgeth Sleep will rarely come; But where Youth with unstuff'd Brain doth couch His Limbs, there Health will hold his Court. Say, Romeo, hast thou been in Bed To-night? Rom. No, Father; yet the sweeter Rest was mine. Fri. Where hast thou been? Rom. I have been feasting with my Enemy, Where, on a sudden, one hath wounded me, That's by me wounded; both our Remedies Within thy Help, and holy Physick lies: I bear no Hatred, blessed Man, for know, My Intercession likewise steads my Foe. Fri. Be plain, good Son, and homely in thy Drift; Riddling Confession finds but riddling Shrift. Rom. Then plainly know my Heart's dear Love is fix'd On the fair Daughter of rich Capulet, And her's on mine:âWhen, and where, and how We met, we woo'd, and did our Vows exchange, Shall be related to thee instantly; So thou consent to marry us this Day. Fri. Romeo, I love thee well: Come in with me: With this good View, I'll thy Assistant be; For this Alliance may so happy prove, To turn your Houshold Rancour to pure Love. Rom. Quick let us hence; for Love is still in haste. Fri. Wisely, and slow; they stumble that run fast. [Exeunt. SCENE, the Street. Enter Benvolio, and Mercutio. Merc. Where the Devil shou'd our Friend Romeo be? Came he not home To night? Beanv. Not to his Father's; I spoke to his Man. Merc. Why, that same Cupid torments him so, that he will sure run mad. Benv. Romeo scarce sleeps, or sleeping finds no Rest, His Mind is so disturb'd with various Dreams. Merc. O then I see Queen Mab hath been with him: She is the Fairies Mid-wife, and she comes In Shape no bigger than an Agat-stone On the Fore-finger of an Alderman, Drawn with a Team of little Atomies, Athwart Men's Noses as they lie asleep: Her Waggon-Spokes made of long Spinners Legs; The Cover, of the Wings of Grashoppers; The Traces, of the smallest Spider's Web; The Collars, of the Moon-shine's watry Beams; Her Whip, of Cricket's Bone; the Lash, of Film; Her Waggoner a small grey-coated Gnat, Not half so big as a round little Worm, Prickt from the lazy Finger of a Maid. Her Chariot is an empty Hazel-nut, Made by the Joyner Squirrel, or old Grub, Time out of Mind the Fairies Coach-makers. Benv. A pretty Equipage! But, to what End? Merc. Why, in this State she gallops Night by Night, Through Lovers Brains, and then they dream of Love; On Courtiers Knees, that dream on Court'sies strait: O'er Lawyers Fingers, who strait dream on Fees: O'er Ladies Lips, who strait on Kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with Blisters plagues, Because their Breaths with Sweet-meats tainted are. Sometimes she gallops o'er a Lawyer's Nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a Suit: And sometimes comes she with a Tythe-pig's Tail, Tickling the Parson as he lies asleep; Then dreams he of another Benefice. Benv. Queen Mab has certainly paid thee a Visit, Thou art so full of dreaming Phantasies. Merc. Sometimes she driveth o'er a Soldier's Neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign Throats, Of Breaches, Ambuscades, Spanish Blades, Of Healths five Fathom deep; and then anon Drums in his Ears, at which he starts and wakes, And being thus frighted, swears a Prayer or two, And sleeps again. Rom. Peace Mercutio, peace: Thou talk'st of nothing. Merc. True, I talk of Dreams; Which are the Children of an idle Brain, Begot of nothing, but vain Phantasy, Which is as thin of Substance as the Air, And more unconstant than the Wind. Benv. Tybalt, the Kinsman to Old Capulet, hath sent a Letter to Romeo's Father's House. Merc. A Challenge on my Life. Benv. Romeo will answer it. Merc. Any Man that can write, may answer a Letter. Benv. Nay, he will answer the Letter's Master, if he be challenged. Merc. Alas! poor Romeo, he's already dead; stabb'd with a white Wench's black Eye; run thro' the Ear with a Love-Song; the very Pin of his Heart cleft with the blind Boy's Bow-Shaft: And is he a Man to encounter Tibalt? Benv. Why, what is Tibalt? Merc. More than the Prince of Cats: O he's the couragious Captain of Compliments; he fights as you sing prickt Songs; keeps Time, Distance, and Proportion; rests his Minum, one, two, and the third in your Bosom; the very Butcher of a Silk Button. A Duellist, a Duellist; a Gentleman of the very first House, of the first and second Cause: Ah! the immortal Passado, the Punto, Reverso, the Hay! Benv. The what? Merc. Pox of such antick Lisping affected Phantasies; these new Tuners of Accents: A very good Blade!âa very tall Man! a very good Whore!âwhy is not this a lamentable Thing, Grandsire, that we shou'd be thus afflicted with these strange Flies, these Fashion-mongers, these pardonnez moy's, who stand so much on the new Form that they cannot sit at Ease, on the old Bench: Oh! their Bon's! their Bon's! Enter Romeo. Benv. Here comes Romeo. Merc. Without his Roe, like a dried Herring: Oh! Flesh, Flesh, how art thou fishified? Now is he for the Numbers that Petrarch flow'd in: Laura to his Lady was but a Kitchen-wench; marry she had better Love to berime her: Dido a Dowdy, Cleopatra a Gipsy, Helen and Hero Hildings and Harlots: Thisby a grey Eye or so; but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo Bonjour; there's a French Salutation to your French Stop. Rom. Good-morrow to you both! Enter Nurse and Peter. Nurse. Peter! Peter. Anon. Nurse. My Fan Peter. Merc. Do, good Peter, to hide her Face; for her Fan is the fairer of the two Nurse. Give you Good-morrow, Gentlemen. Merc. Give you Good-e'en, fair Gentlewoman. Nurse. Is it Good-e'en. Merc. 'Tis even so, good Lady. Nurse. Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find young Romeo? Rom. I am the youngest of that Name. Nurse. If you be he, Sir, I desire some Confidence with you. Benv. She will indite, or invite him to a Supper. Merc. A Bawd, a Bawd: So ho! Romeo; will you come to your Father's? We'll to Supper thither. Rom. I'll follow you. Merc. Farewell ancient Lady. [Ex. Mercutio and Benvolio. Nurse. I pray you, Sir, what saucy Merchant was that, was so full of his Roguery? Rom. A Gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk; and will speak more in a Minute, than he will stand to in a Month. Nurse. An he speak any thing against me, I'll take him down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks: And if I cannot, I'll find those that shall, scurvy Knave! I am none of his flirt Gills. Pray you, Sir, a Word: And as I told you, my young Lady bid me enquire you out: What she bid me say, I will keep to myself: But first let me tell you, if you shou'd lead her into a Fool's Paradice, as they say, it were a very gross kind of Behaviour as they say; for the Gentlewoman is young, and therefore if you shou'd deal double with her truly it were an ill thing to be offer'd to any Gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. Rom. Commend me to thy Lady and MistressâI protest unto thee Nurse. Good Heart, and i'faith I'll tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she'll be a joyful Woman. Rom. What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? thou dost not mark me, Nurse. I will tell her Sir, that you do protest; which as I take it is a Gentleman-like Offer. Rom. Bid her devise some Means to come to shrift this Afternoon; and there she shall at Friar Laurence Cell be shrived and married: Here is for thy Pains. Nurse. No truly, Sir, not a Penny. Rom. Go to, I say, you shall. Nurse. This Afternoon, Sir? Well, she shall be there. Rom. And stay, good Nurse, behind the Abbey Wall: Within this Hour my Man shall be with thee, And bring thee Cords made like a tackled Stair, Which to the high Top-gallant of my Joy Must be my Convoy in the secret Night. Farewell, be trusty, and I'll quit thy Pains. Nurse. Now Heaven bless thee! Harkee Sir! Rom. What say'st thou, my dear Nurse? Nurse. Is your Page secret? Did you ne'er hear say, Two may keep Council, putting one away? Rom. I warrant thee, the Lad's as true as Steel Nurse. Well Sir, my Mistress is the sweetest Lady, Lord! Lord! when 'twas a little prating thingâ Oh! there's a Nobleman in Town, one Paris that wou'd fain lay Knife a-board; but she, good Soul, had as lieve see a Toad, a very Toad, as see him: I anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer Man; but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any Clout in the versal World. Doth not Rosemary and Romeo begin both with a Letter. Rom. Aye Nurse! what of that? Both with an R. Nurse. Aye Mocker! that's the Dog's name. R is for thee. No, I know it begins with no other Letter; and she hath the prettiest Sententions of it, of you, and Rosemary; that it wou'd do you good to hear it. Rom. Commend me to thy Lady [Exit. Romeo. Nurse. A thousand times. Peter. Peter. Anon Nurse. Take my Fan, and go before. [Exeunt. SCENE Capulet's House Enter Juliet. Jul. The Clock struck Nine, when I did send the Nurse; In half an Hour she promis'd to return: Perchance she cannot meet himâthat's not so. She is old and lame: Love's Heralds shou'd be Thoughts, Which ten Times faster glide, than the Sun Beams, Driving back Shadows over low'ring Hills. Therefore do nimble-pinion'd Doves draw Love; And therefore hath the swift-wing'd Cupid Wings. Now is the Sun upon the highmost Hill Of this Day's Journey; and from nine till twelve Is three long Hoursâand yet she is not come; Had she Affections, and warm youthful Blood, She'd be as swift in Motion as a Ball; My Words would bandy her to my sweet Love, And his to me. Enter Nurse. O! she comes, what News? Hast thou met with him? Send thy Man away. Nurse. Peter, stay at the Gate. Jul. How now, sweet Nurse, O Lord! why look'st thou sad? Nurse. I am a-weary, let me rest a while: Fie how my Bones ake! what a jaunt have I had? Jul. I wou'd thou had'st my Bones, and I thy News: Nay, come, I pray thee speak, good Nurse, speak. Nurse. Give me some AquavitÃ¦. Enter Peter with a Bottle and Cup. Jul. Is thy News good or bad? Answer to that; Say either, and I'll stay the Circumstance: Let me be satisfied, is it good or bad? Nurse. Well; you have made a simple Choice; you know not how to chuse a ManâRomeo! no not he. Though his Face be better than any Man's, yet his Legs excel all Men's; and for a Hand, and a Foot, and a Body; tho' they be not to be talk'd on, yet they are past Compare; he is not the Flower of Courtesy, but I warrant him as gentle as a Lamb. Go thy ways, Wench, say thy Prayers. What, have you dined at home? Jul. No, no,âbut all this did I know before: What says he of our Marriage? What of that? Nurse. Lord how my Head akes! what a Head have I! it beats as it wou'd fall in twenty Pieces! my Back a-t'other Side; O my Back, my Back! Beshrew your Heart, for sending me about to catch my Death, with jauuting up and down. Jul. I'faith, I am sorry that thou art so ill, Do, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my Love? Nurse. Your Love says like an honest Gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and I warrant a virtuous GentlemanâWhere is your Mother? Jul. Where is your Mother? Why, she is within: Where shou'd she be? How odly thou reply'st! Your Love says like an honest Gentleman: Where is your Mother?â Nurse. O Lady dear! Are you so hot? marry come up I trow: Is this the Poultice for my aking Bones? Hence-forward do your Messages yourself. Jul. Here's such a Coil: Come, what says Romeo? Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift To-day? Jul. I have. Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence Cell, There stays a Husband to make you a Wife: Now comes the wanton Blood up in your Cheeks; They'll be in Scarlet strait at any News: Hie you to Church. I must another way, To fetch a Ladder, by the which your Love Must climb a Bird's Nest soon, when it is dark. I am the Drudge, and toil in your Delight, But you shall bear the Burden soon at Night. Go, I'll to Dinner, hie you to the Cell. [Exit. Jul. With Wings of Love I fly; good Nurse, farewell. [Exit. SCENE, the Monastery, &amp;c. Friar Laurence, and Romeo. Friar. So smile the Heavens upon the holy Act, That after Hours of Sorrow chide us not. Rom. Amen, Amen: But come what Sorrow can, It cannot countervail th'Exchange of Joy, That one short Minute gives me in her Sight: Do thou but close our Hands with holy Words, Then Love devouring Death do what he dare, It is enough, I may but call her mine. Fri. These violent Delights have violent Ends, And in their Triumph die; like Fire and Powder, Which as they meet, consume; the sweetest Honey Is loathsome in its own Deliciousness, And in the Taste destroys the Appetite: Therefore love mod'rately; long Love doth so; Too swift arrives as tardy, as too slow. Enter Juliet. Here comes the Ladyâ Juliet. Good-ev'n to my Ghostly Confessor. Fri. Romeo shall thank thee, Daughter, for us both. Jul. As much to him. Else are his Thanks too much. Rom. Ah! Juliet, if the Measures of thy Joy, Be heap'd like mine, and that thy Skill be more To blazon it, then sweeten with thy Breath This neighb'ring Air; and let rich Musick's Tongue Unfold th'imagin'd Happiness, that both Receive in either, by this dear Encounter. Jul. Conceit more rich in Matter than in Words, Brags of his Substance, not of Ornament: They are but Beggars that can count their Worth; But my true Love is grown to such Excess, I cannot sum up one half of my Wealth. Fri. Come, come with me, and we will make short Work; For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone, 'Till holy Rites incorp'rate two in one. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE, the Street. Mercutio, and Benvolio. Benv. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire; The Day is hot, the Capulets' abroad; And if we meet we shall not 'scape a Brawl; For now these hot Days is the mad Blood stirring. Merc. Thou art like one of those Fellows, that when he enters the Confines of a Tavern, claps me his Sword upon the Table, and says, Heaven send me no need of thee; and by the Operation of a second Cup, draws it on the Drawer; when indeed, there is no need. Benv. Am I like such a Fellow? Merc. Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy Mood, as any in Italy; and as soon mov'd to be moody; and as soon moody to be mov'd. Benv. And what to? Merc. Why, thou wilt quarrel with a Man that has a Hair more or less in his Beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a Man for cracking Nuts, having no other Reason, but because thou hast hazel Eyes; what Eye, but such an Eye, would 'spy out such a Quarrel? Thy Head is as full of Quarrels, as an Egg is full of Meat, and yet thy Head hath been beaten as addle as an Egg for quarrelling: Thou hast quarrell'd with a Man for coughing in the Street, because he hath 'wakened thy Dog that hath lain asleep in the Sun. Did'st thou not fall out with thy Tailor for wearing his new Doublet before Easter? With another, for tying his new Shoes with old Ribband? And yet thou wilt tutor me for quarrelling! Benv. If I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any Man should buy the Fee-simple of my Life for an Hour and a Quarter. Merc. The Fee-simple? O simple! Enter Tibalt. Benv. By my Head here comes a Capulet. Merc. By my Heels I care not. Tib. Gentlemen, Good-ev'n; a Word with one of you. Merc. And but one Word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a Word and a Blow. Tib. You shall find me apt enough to that, Sir, if you will give me occasion. Merc. Cou'd you not take some occasion, without giving? Tib. Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeoâ Merc. Consort! what do'st thou make Minstrels of us? If thou make Minstrels of us, then look to hear nothing but Discords: Here's my Fiddle-stick; here's that will make you dance. Zounds! Consort! [Laying his Hand on his Sword. Benv. We talk here in the publick Haunt of Men; Either withdraw into some private Place, Or reason coldly of your Grievances, Or else depart: Here all Eyes gaze on us. Merc. Men's Eyes were made to look, and let them gaze; I will not budge for no Man's Pleasure, I. Enter Romeo. Tib. Well, Peace be with you, Sir; here comes my Man. Merc. But I'll be hang'd, Sir, if he wears your Livery; Marry go first to Field, he'll be your Follower; Your Worship, in that Sense, may call him Man. Tib. Romeo, the Hate I bear thee can afford No better Terms than this,âThou art a Villain. Rom. Tybalt, the Reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining Rage To such a greeting; Villain, I am none: Therefore, farewell: I see thou know'st me not. Tib. Boy, this shall not excuse the Injuries, That thou hast done me; therefore turn, and draw. Rom. (Stopping his Hand) I do protest, I never injur'd thee, But love thee better than thou can'st devise, 'Till thou shalt know the Reason of my Love: And so, good Capulet, (whose Name I tender As dearly as my own) be satisfied. [Romeo walks apart. Merc. O calm, dishonourable, vile Submission! Ah! La Stoccata carries it away. Tybalt, you Rat-catcher, will you walk? Tib. What wou'd you have with me? Merc. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine Lives, that I mean to make bold withal; and as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your Sword out of his Pilcher by the Ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your Ears ere it be out. Tib. I am for you. [Drawing. [Romeo returning, interposes. Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy Rapier up. Merc. Come, Sir, your Passado. [Merc. and Tib. fight. Rom. Hold Tibalt, good Mercutio. [Tibalt wounds Mercutio under Romeo's Arm, and goes out. Merc. I am hurtâ A Plague of both your Houses! I am sped: Is he gone, and hath nothing? Benv. What, art thou hurt? Merc. Aye. aye, a Scratch, a Scratch; marry 'tis enough: Some one fetch a Surgeon. Rom. Courage Man, the Hurt cannot be much. Merc. No, 'tis not so deep as a Well, nor so wide as a Church-Door; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve: Ask for me To-morrow, and you shall find me a grave Man. I am pepper'd, I warrant, for this World; a Plague of both your Houses! what a Dog! a Rat! a Mouse! a Cat! to Scratch a Man to Death! a Braggart, a Rogue, a Villain, that fights by the Book of Arithmetick? Why the Devil came you between? I was hurt under your Arm. Rom. I thought all for the best Merc. Help me into some House, Benvolio, or I shall faint; a Plague of both your Houses, they have made Worms-Meat of me: Curse your Houses. [Exit. Mer. and Ben. Rom. This Gentleman the Prince's near Ally, My worthy Friend hath got his mortal Hurt In my behalf; my Reputation stain'd With Tybalt's Slander; Tybalt, that an Hour Hath been my Cousin: O sweet Juliet, Thy Beauty hath made me effeminate, And in my Temper soft'ned Valour's Steel. Enter Benvolio. Benv. O, Romeo! Romeo! brave Mercutio's dead, That gallant Spirit hath aspir'd the Clouds, Which too untimely here did scorn the Earth. Rom. More Fates do yet on this black Day depend; Or this begins the Woe, others must end. Benv. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. Rom. Alive in Triumph? And Mercutio slain? Away to Heaven respective Lenity, And Fire-eyed Fury be my Conduct now. Enter Tybalt. Tybalt, receive the Villain back again, That late thou gav'st me; brave Mercutio's Soul Is but a little way above our Heads, Staying for thine to keep him Company: Or thou, or I, or both, must go with him. Tib. Thou wretched Boy that did'st consort him here, Shall with him hence Rom. This shall determine that. [They fight: Tibalt falls. Benv. Romeo, away begone, The Citizens are up, and Tibalt slainâ Stand not amaz'd; the Prince will doom thee dead, If thou art taken; hence, begone, away. Rom. O, I am Fortune's Fool. [Ex. Romeo. Enter Prince and Paris, with Attendants. Prin. Where are the vile Beginners of this Brawl? Benv. Most noble Prince I can discover all The unlucky Manage of this fatal Fray; There lies the Man slain by young Romeo, That slew thy Kinsman brave Mercutio. Prin. Benvolio, who began this? Benv. Tibalt here slain, whom Romeo's Hand did slay; Romeo still spoke him fair, bid him bethink How nice the Quarrel was, and urg'd withal Your high Displeasure: All this utter'd With gentle Breath, calm Look, Knees humbly bow'd, Could not make Truce with the unruly Spleen Of Tibalt, deaf to Peace, but that he tilts, With piercing Steel, at bold Mercutio's Breast, Who all as hot, turns deadly Point to Point, And with a martial Scorn, with one Hand beats Cold Death aside, and with the other sends It back to Tibalt, whose Dexterity Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud Hold Friends, Friends part; and swifter than his Tongue His agil Arm beats down their fatal Points, And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose Arm An envious Thrust from Tibalt hit the Life Of stout Mercutio, and then Tibalt fled: But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertain'd Revenge, And to't they go like Lightning; for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tibalt slain, And as he fell did Romeo turn to fly. Prin. And for that Offence Immediately we do exile him hence: I will be deaf to Pleading and Excuses, Nor Tears nor Prayers shall purchase our Abuses, Therefore use none; let Romeo hence, in haste, When in Verona found, that Hour's his last: Bear hence this Body, and attend our Will. Mercy but Murders, pardoning those that Kill. [Exeunt. SCENE Capulet's House Juliet alone. Jul. Gallop a-pace ye fiery-footed Steeds, To PhÅbus' Mansion: Such a Charioteer As Phaeton, wou'd whip you to the West, And bring in Cloudy Night immediately. Spread thy close Curtain, Love-performing Night, To hoodwink jealous Eyes; and Romeo Leap to these Arms, untalk'd of and unseen. Give me my Romeo, and when he shall die, Take him and cut him out in little Stars, And he will make the Face of Heaven so fine, That all the World shall be in love with Night, And pay no Worship to the gaudy Sun. O, I have bought the Mansion of a Love, But not possess'd it. Tedious is this Day As is the Night, before some Festival, To an impatient Child that hath new Robes, And may not wear them. O here comes my Nurse. Enter Nurse with Cords. And she brings News; and every Tongue that speaks But Romeo's Name, speaks heavenly Eloquence: Now Nurse, what News? What hast thou there The Cords that Romeo bid thee fetch? Nurse. Ay, ay the Cords. Jul. Ay me, what News? Why dost thou wring thy Hands. Nurse. Ah well-a-day he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, We are undone, Lady; we are undoneâ Alack the day, he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead. Jul. Can Heaven be so envious? Nurse. Romeo can; though Heav'n cannot, O Romeo, Romeo! Who ever wou'd have thought it, Romeo! Jul. What Devil art thou, that does torment me thus? This Torture should be roar'd in dismal Hell. Hath Romeo slain himself? Say then but ay, And that one Syllable shall poison more Than the Death-darting Eye of Cockatrice. Nurse. I saw the Wound, I saw it with my Eyes; Heaven save the Mark! here on his manly Breast A piteous Coarse! a bloody piteous Coarse! Pale, pale as Ashes, all bedaub'd in Blood; All in Gore Blood! I swooned at the Sight. Jul. O break my Heart, poor Bankrupt, break at once; To Prison Eyes, ne'er look at Liberty; Vile Earth to Earth resign; end Motion here, And thou and Romeo press one heavy Bier. Nurse. O Tibalt, Tibalt, the best Friend I had; O courteous Tibalt, honest Gentleman: That ever I shou'd live to see thee dead! Jul. What Storm is this that blows so contrary? Is Romeo slaughter'd? And is Tibalt dead? My dear lov'd Cousin, and my dearer Lord? Then let the Trumpet sound the general Doom, For who is living, if those two are gone? Nurse. Tibalt is dead, and Romeo banished! Romeo, that kill'd him, he is banished. Jul. O Heaven! did Romeo's Hand shed Tibalt's Blood? Nurse. It did, it did; alas the Day, it did. Jul. O serpent Heart, hid with a flow'ry Face! Did ever Dragon keep so fair a Cave? Beautiful Tyrant-Fiend angelical! Oh Nature, what had'st thou to do in Hell, When thou did'st bower the Spirit of a Fiend, In mortal Paradise of such sweet Flesh? Was ever Book containing such vile Matter So fairly bound? O that Deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous Palace! Nurse. There's no Trust, no Faith, no Honesty in Men; all perjur'd. Shame come to Romeo! Jul. Blister'd be thy Tongue, For such a Wish! he was not born to Shame; Upon his Brow Shame is ashamed to sit: For 'tis a Throne where Honour may be crown'd. Sole Monarch of the Universal Earth. O what a Beast was I to chide him so! Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your Cousin? Jul. Shall I speak iil of him that is my Husband? Ah poor my Lord, what Tongue shall smooth thy Name, When I, thy three Hour's Wife, have mangled it? My Husband lives, that Tibalt wou'd have slain; And Tibalt's dead, that wou'd have kill'd my Husband; All this is Comfort; wherefore weep I then? Some Word there was still worse than Tibalt's Death, That murder'd me: I wou'd forget it fain. But oh! it presses to my Memory, Like damned guilty Deed to Sinners Minds: Tibalt is dead, and Romeo banished! That banished, that one Word banished, Hath slain ten thousand Tibalts: Tibalt's Death, Was Woe enough, if it had ended there: Or if four Woe delights in Fellowship, And needy will be rank'd with other Griefs, Why follow'd not, when she said Tibalt's dead, Thy Father, or thy Mother, nay or both? Romeo is banishedâTo speak that Word, Is Father, Mother, Tibalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead! Romeo is banished! There is no End, no Limit, Measure, Bound, In that Word's Death; no Words can sound that Woe. Where is my Father, and my Mother, Nurse? Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tibalt's Body. Will you go to them? I will bring you thither. Jul. Wash they his Wounds with Tears? mine shall be spent When their's are dry, for Romeo's Banishment. Nurse. Hie to your Chamber, I'll find Romeo, To Comfort you, I wot well where he is; Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at Night: I'll to him, he is hid at Laurence's Cell. Jul. O find him, give this Ring to my poor Love; And bid him come to take his last Farewel. [Exeunt. SCENE, the Monastery. Enter Friar Laurence to Romeo. Fri. Romeo, come forth, come forth, thou fearful Man; Affliction is enamour'd of thy Parts, And thou art wedded to Calamity. Rom. Father, what News? What is the Prince's Doom? What Sorrow craves Acquaintance at my Hand, That I yet know not? Fri. Too familiar Is my dear Son with such four Company. I bring thee Tidings of the Prince's Doom. Rom. He can but doom me dead, and I'm prepar'd. Fri. A gentler Judgment vanish'd from his Lips, Not Body's Death, but Body's Banishment. Rom. Ha! Banishment! be merciful say Death; For Exile hath more Terror in his Looks, Than Death itself: Do not say Banishment. Fri. Here from Verona art thou banish'd:â Be patient, for the World is broad and wide. Rom. There is no World without Verona's Walls But Purgatory, Torture, Hell itself! Thou cut'st my Head off with a golden Axe, And smilest upon the Stroke that murders me Fri. O deadly Sin! O rude Unthankfulness! Thy Fault our Law calls Death, but the kind Prince Taking thy Part hath push'd aside the Law, And turn'd that black word Death to Banishment: This is meer Mercy, and thou see'st it not. Rom. 'Tis Torture and not Mercy: Heaven is here Where Juliet lives, every unworthy Thing Lives here in Heaven, but by looking on her, But Romeo may not; more Validity, More honourable State, more Happiness Have Carrion Flies, than Romeo; they may seize On the white Wonder of dear Juliet's Hand, And steal immortal Blessings from her Lips, Which banish'd Romeo cannot. O Father had'st thou no strong Poison mixt, No Dagger, nor no present Means of Death, But Banishment to torture me withal? Friar, the Damned use that Word in Hell; Howlings attend it: How hast thou the Heart, Being a Divine, a ghostly Confessor A Sin-Absolver, and my Friend profest, To mangle me with that Word Banishment? Fri. Fond Man, hear me but speak. Rom. O! thou wilt speak again of Banishment! Death's more desirable than living Torment? To die is to be banish'd from myself: And Juliet is myself, my Life, my Soul. Unless I be by Juliet in the Night, There is no Musick in the Nightingale; Unless I be by Juliet in the Day, The Day grows hateful as the blackest Night: She is my Essence, and I cease to be, If not by her fair Influence kept alive. Fri. Yet hear what I wou'd say of thy Estate. Rom. Thou can'st not speak of what thou dost not feel. Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy Love, Scarce three Hours married, Tibalt murder'd, Doating like me, and like me banish'd; Then might'st thou speak: Then might'st thou tear thy Hair, And fall upon the Ground, as I do now. [Throws himself on the Ground. Fri. Arise, one Knocks; good Romeo hide thyself, Thou wilt be takenâStay a whileâstand up. Run to my StudyâBy and byâWhat Wilfulness! I come; who knocks so hard? What is your Will? Nurse. within.] Let me come in, and you shall know my Errand: I come from Lady Juliet. Fri. Welcome, then. Enter Nurse. Nurse. O, holy Friar, where is my Lady's Lord? Where's Romeo? Fri. There, on the Ground, with his own Tears made drunk. Nurse. O! he's even in my Mistress's Case: Just in her Case: O, woeful Sympathy! Rom. Nurse. Nurse. Ah, Sir! Death's the End of all. Rom. Speak'st thou of Juliet? How is it with her? Doth she not think me a dire Murderer? How I have stain'd the Childhood of our Joy, With Blood remov'd but little from her own? Where is she? How does she? And what says she? Nurse. Oh! she says nothing, Sir! but weeps, and weeps; And now falls on her Bed, and then starts up, And Tibalt cries; and then on Romeo calls, And then, down falls again. Rom. As if that Name, Shot from the deadly Level of a Gun, Did murder her, as this accursed Hand Murder'd her Kinsman: Tell me, Friar, tell me! In what vile Part of this Anatomy, Doth my Name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack The hateful Mansionâ [Laying his Hand on his Sword. Fri. Hold thy desperate Hand: Art thou a Man? Thy Form cries out thou art; Thy Tears are Womanish; thy wild Acts do note The unreasonable Fury of a Beast. Go, get thee to thy Love, as was decreed; Ascend her Chamber, hence, and comfort her: But, look thou stay not till the Watch be set, For then thou can'st not pass to Mantua, Where thou shalt live till we can find a Time To blaze your Marriage, reconcile your Friends, Beg Pardon of the Prince, and call thee back, With twenty hundred thousand times more Joy, Than thou went'st forth in Lamentation. Go before, Nurse; commend me to thy Lady, And bid her hasten all the House to Bed, Which heavy Sorrow-makes them apt unto. Romeo is coming. Nurse. O Lord I could have staid here all Night long, to hear good Counsel: Oh! what Learning is? My Lord, I'll tell my Lady you will come. Rom. Do so; and bid my Sweet prepare to chide. Nurse. Here is a Ring she bid me give you, Sir: âHie you; make haste; for it grows very late. [Exit Nurse. Rom. How much my Comfort is reviv'd by this! Fri. Sojourn in Mantua: I'll find your Page, And he shall signify, from time to time, Every good Hap to you that chances here: Give me thy Hand, 'tis late; farewell, Good-night.â Rom. I am summon'd by the Mistress of my Heart, Or 'twere a Grief so soon from thee to part. SCENE, Capulet's House. Capulet and Paris. Cap. Things have fallen out, Sir, most unluckily; Juliet did love her Kinsman Tibalt dearly, And so did I:âWell, we were born to die. 'Tis very late; she'll not come down To-night. Paris. These Times of Woe afford no time to woo. My Lord, Good-night: Commend me to your Daughter. Cap. Sir Paris, we will make a desperate Tender of my Child's Love; I think she will be rul'd in all Respects, by me; nay, more, I doubt it not. But soft, what Day is this? Paris. Monday, my Lord. Cap. Monday; ha! ha! well, Wednesday is too soon: On Thursday let it be; you shall be married: Well, keep no great a-doâa Friend, or twoâ For hark you, Tibalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our Kinsman, if we revel much: Therefore we'll have some half a dozen Friends, And there's an End: But, what say you to Thursday? Paris. My Lord, I would that Thursday were Tomorrow. Cap. Well, get you gone;âon Thursday be it then? Farewell, my Lord.âLight to my Chamber, hoa! Good-night.â [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE, Juliet's Chamber. Romeo and Juliet discovered. Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near Day, It was the Nightingale, and not the Lark, That pierc'd the fearful Hollow of thine Ear: Nightly she sings on yond' Pomgranate Tree: Believe me, Love, it was the Nightingale. Rom. It was the Lark, the Herald of the Morn, No Nightingale; look Love, what envious Streaks Do lace the severing Clouds in yonder East: Night's Candles are burnt out, and jocund Day Stands tiptoe, on the misty Mountain Tops. I must begone, and live; or stay, and die. Jul. Yon Light is not Day-light; I know it well It is some Meteor that the Sun exhales To be to thee this Night a Torch-Bearer, And light thee on thy Way to Mantua. Then stay a while; thou shalt not go so soon. Rom. Let me then stay, let me be ta'en and die; If thou wilt have it so, I am content: I'll say yon Gray is not the Morning's Eye, 'Tis but the pale Reflex of Cynthia's Brow; I'll say it is the Nightingale that beats The vaulty Heaven's, so high above our Heads, And not the Lark, the Messenger of Morn: Come Death and welcome. Juliet wills it so. What says my Love? Let's talk; it is not Day. Jul. It is the Lark, that sings so out of Tune, Straining harsh Discords, and unpleasing Sharps: Some say, the Lark makes sweet Division; This doth not so, for she divideth us. Some say the Lark and loathed Toad change Eyes; O! now I would they had chang'd Voices too! O! now begone, more light and light it grows. Nurse within. Nurse. Madam. Jul. Nurse. Nurse. Your Lady Mother's coming to your Chamber; The Day is broke; be wary, look about. Jul. Then, thou must go: Love! Lord! ah! Husband! Friend! I must hear from thee every Day in the Hour, For in a Minute there are many Days: O, by this 'count, I shall be much in Years, Ere I again behold my Romeo. Rom. The Saints that heard our Vows, and know our Loves, Seeing my Faith, and thy unspotted Truth, Will sure take care, and let no Wrongs annoy thee; Upon my Knees I'll ask 'em every Day, How my kind Juliet does;âand every Night, In the severe Distresses of my Fate, As I perhaps shall wander thro' the Desert, And want a Place to rest my weary Head on, I'll count the Stars, and bless 'em as they shine, And court 'em all, for my dear Juliet's Safety. Jul. Oh! Banishment! eternal Banishment! Ne'er to return! must we ne'er meet again? My Heart will break; I cannot bear that Thought And live, cou'd I but see to the End of Woe, There were some Comfort;âbut eternal Torment, Is ever insupportable to Thought: It cannot be that we shall part for ever. Rom. No, for my Banishment may be recall'd; Then shall I boldly claim fair Juliet mine: Whilst happiest Men shall envy at our Blessings, And Poets write the Wonders of our Loves. Jul. Oh! I cou'd find out Things to talk to thee for ever. Rom. Weep not, the Time We had to stay together has been employ'd In richest Love. Jul. We ought to summon all The Spirit of soft Passion up, to chear, Our Hearts, thus lab'ring with the Pangs of parting. Oh! my poor Romeo! Rom. Ah! my kindest Juliet! Jul. But do'st thou think we e'er shall meet again? Rom. I doubt it not; and all these Woes shall serve For sweet Discourses in our Time to come. Jul. Alas! I have an ill-divining Soul: Methinks I see thee, now thou art from my Arms, Like a stark Ghost, with Horror in thy Visage: Either my Eye-sight fails, or thou look'st pale. Rom. And trust me, Love, in my Eye so dost thou: Dry sorrow drinks our Blood:âFarewell, Farewell. Jul. All good Angels guard thee. [Ex. Romeo. Oh Fortune, Fortune! all Men call thee fickle; If thou art fickle, what hast thou to do With him that is renowned for his Faith? Yet be fickle Fortune: For then I hope Thou wilt not keep him longâBut send him back. Enter Lady Capulet. L. Cap. Ho, Daughter, are you up? Jul. Who is't that calls! Is it my Lady Mother? What unaccustom'd Cause procures her hither? [Aside. L. Cap. Why, how now Juliet? Jul. Madam, I am not well. L. Cap. Evermore weeping for your Cousin's Death? What wilt thou wash him from his Grave with Tears? Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling Loss. L. Cap. Well Girl, thou weep'st not so much for his Death, As that the Villain lives, which slaughter'd him. Jul. What Villain, Madam. L. Cap. That same Villain, Romeo. Jul. Villain and he are many Miles asunder. L. Cap. Content thee, Girl: If I could find a Man I wou'd soon send to Mantua, where he is, And give him such an unaccustom'd Dram, That he should soon keep Tibalt Company. Jul. Find you the Means, and I'll soon find such a Man; For while he lives, my Heart shall ne'er be light Till I behold himâdeadâis my poor Heart, Thus for a Kinsman vex'd? L. Cap. Well, let that pass. I come to bring thee joyful Tidings, Girl. Jul. And Joy comes well in such a needful Time. What are they, I beseech your Ladyship? L. Cap. Well, well; thou hast a careful Father, Child, One, who to put thee from thy Heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden Day of Joy, That thou expect'st not; nor I look'd not for. Jul. Madam, in happy Time, what Day is this? L. Cap. Marry, my Child, early next Thursday Morn, Paris the gallant, young and noble Count, Shall happily make thee a joyful Bride. Jul. I wonder at this Haste, that I must wed Ere he that must be Husband comes to woo. I pray you tell my Lord and Father, Madam, I will not marry yet; and when I do It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris:âThese are News indeed. L. Cap. Here comes your Father, tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your Hands. Enter Capulet, and Nurse. Cap. How now? What, still in Tears? Evermore show'ring! Now, Wife, have you deliver'd our Decree? L. Cap. Ay, Sir; but she will none, she gives you Thanks: I wou'd the Fool were married to her Grave. Cap. Soft, take me with you, take me with you, Wife: How! will she none? Doth she not give us Thanks? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a Gentleman to be her Bridegroom? Jul. Not proud, you have; but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate: But thankful even for Hate, that is meant Love. Cap. How now, Chop-Logick! Why, what Riddling's this! Proud! and I thank you! and I thank you not! Thank me no Thankings, nor proud me no Prouds; But settle your fine Joints 'gainst Thursday next, To go with Paris, to St. Peter's Church: Or I will drag thee on a Hurdle thither. Jul. Good Father, I beseech you on my Knees, Hear me with Patience but to speak a Word. Cap. Hang thee, young Baggage disobedient Wretch. I tell thee what, get thee to Church on Thursday Or never after look me in the Face. Speak not, reply not, do not answer me. My Fingers itch Wife, we scarce thought us blest. That Heaven hath sent us but this only Child. But now I see this one is one too much, And that we have a Curse in having her: Out on her Hilding Nurse. Now good Heaven bless her You are to blame my Lord, to rate her so. Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom, hold your Tongue. Good Prudence, smatter with your Gossips go. Nurse. I speak no Treason: Then why mayn't one speak Cap. Peace you mumbling Fool. Utter your Gravity o'er a Gossip's Bowl. For here we need it not L. Cap. You are too hot Cap. It makes me mad: Day, Night, late, early, At home, abroad; alone, in Company, Waking or Sleeping, still my Care hath been To have her match'd: And having now provided A Gentleman of noble Parentage, Of fair Demeans, youthful, and nobly allied; Stuff'd as they say with honourable Parts; Proportion'd as one's Thought would wish a Man: And then to have a wretched pulling Fool, A whining Mammet, in her Fortune's Tender, To answer I'll not wed; I cannot love; I am too young: I pray you pardon me, Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest: If you be mine, I'll give you to my Friend; If you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the Streets; For by my Soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, Nor what is mine shall ever do thee good: Trust to't, bethink you, I'll not be forsworn. [Exit. Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the Clouds, That sees into the Bottom of my Grief. O sweet my Mother, cast me not away, Delay this Marriage for a Month, a Week, Or if you do not, make the bridal Bed In that dim Monument, where Tibalt lies. L. Cap. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a Word; Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee [Exit. Jul. O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? Nurse. Faith, here it is, Romeo is banish'd: All the World to nothing That he dares not come back to challenge you; Or if he do, it needs must be by Stealth. Then, since the Case so stands, as now it doth, I think it best you married with the Count. Oh! he's a lovely Gentleman! Romeo's a Dish-clout to him. Jul. Speak'st thou from thy Heart? Nurse. And from my Soul too; Or else beshrew 'em both! Jul. Go in, and tell my Lady I am gone, Having displeas'd my Father, to Friar Laurence Cell, To make Confession, and to be absolv'd. Nurse. Marry I will, and this is wisely done.â [Exit. Jul. O most wicked Fiend! Thus to dispraise my Lord, with that same Tongue, Which she hath prais'd him with, above Compare, So many thousand Times! Go, Counsellor; Thou and my Bosom, henceforth shall be 'twain: How hateful is this Place in Romeo's Absence? Remov'd from what we love, a Court's a Prison; But with our Loves the least Spot's a World: Then, finding Romeo, I enjoy the World. Oh! Love, how mighty is thy Power! My Heart Grows resolute, inspir'd by thee: 'Tis Love Makes wise Men weak, and silly Women cunning; Cowards couragious, and the Hero tremble: Love can with sudden, and resistless, Power, Abash the Learned; or make an Orator, Of unskill'd Youth;âHumanise the Brute; Exalt the Slave, enslave the Conqueror: Love can make Juliet shun her Father's House, Who ere she knew Love's Influence, thence to have fled, Had broke her Heart; no, I'll not tarry here: I'll to the Friar, and consult with him. If for my Griefs he finds no Remedy, Let the worst come, I still have Power to die. [Exit. SCENE, the Monastry Friar Laurence, and Paris. Fri. On Thursday, Sir! the Time is very short. Paris. My Father Capulet will have it so. Fri. You say, you do not know the Lady's Mind. Uneven is this Course, I like it not. Paris. Immoderately she weeps for Tibalt's Death, And therefore have I little talk'd of Love. For Venus smiles not in a House of Tears. Now, Sir, her Father counts it dangerous, That we shou'd give her Sorrow so much Sway; And in his Wisdom hastes our Marriage, To stop the Inundation of her Tears; Which, too much minded by herself alone, May be put from her by Society. Now, you do know the Reason of this Haste? Fri. I wou'd I knew not why it shou'd be slack'd. [Aside. Look, Sir, here comes the Lady t'wards my Cell. Enter Juliet. Paris. Welcome, my Love, my Lady, and my Wife. Jul. That may be, Sir, when I may be a Wife. Paris. That may be, must be, Love, on Thursday next. Jul. What must be, shall be. Paris. Come you to make Confession to this Father? Jul. To answer that, were to confess to you. Paris. Do not deny to him that you love me? Jul. I will confess to you, that I love him. Paris. So will you, I am sure, that you love me. Jul. If I do so, it will be of more Price, Being spoke behind your back, than to your Face. Paris. Poor soul, thy Face is much abus'd with Tears. Jul. The Tears have got small Victory by that: For it was bad enough before their Spite. Paris. Thou wrong'st it more than Tears with that Report. Jul. That is no Slander, Sir, which is but Truth, And what I speak, I speak it to my Face. Paris. Thy Face is mine, and thou hath slander'd it. Jul. It may be so, for it is not my own. Are you at leisure, holy Father, now, Or shall I come at Evening Mass? Fri. My Leisure serves me, pensive Daughter, now My Lord, I must entreat the Time alone. Paris. Heaven shield I shou'd disturb Devotion: Juliet, farewell, and keep this holy Kiss. [Exit Paris. Jul. Go shut the Door, and when thou hast done so Come weep with me, past Hope, past Cure, past Help. Fri. O, Juliet I already know your Grief, I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursdry next be married to the Count. Jul. Tell me not Friar that thou hear'st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it: If in thy Wisdom thou can'st give no Help, Do thou but call my Resolution wise, And with this Dagger I'll help it presently. Heaven join'd my Heart and Romeo's, thou our Hands; And ere this Hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd, Shall be the Label to another Deed, Or my true Heart with treacherous Revolt Turn to another, this shall slay them both: Therefore out of thy long-experienced Time, Give me some present Council, or behold 'Twixt my Extreams and me, this bloody Dagger Shall play the Umpire: Arbitrating that, Which the Commission of thy Years and Art Cou'd to no Issue of true Honour bring: Speak, and be brief; for I desire to die. If what thou speak'st, speak't not of Remedy. Fri. Hold Daughter, I do spy a kind of Hope, Which craves as desperate an Execution, As that is desperate which we wou'd prevent. If rather than to marry with Count Paris Thou hast the Strength or Will, to slay thyself; Then it is likely thou wilt undertake A Thing like Death to chide away this Shame, That cop'st with Death itself, to scape from it, And if thou dar'st I'll give the Remedy Jul. O bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, From off the Battlements of yonder Tower: Or chain me to some steepy Mountain's Top Where roaring Bears, and savage Lions roam; Or shut me nightly in a Charnel House, O'er-cover'd quite with dead Men's ratling Sculls, Or bid me go into a new made Grave, And hide me with a dead Man in his Shroud; Things that to hear them nam'd, have made me tremble; And I will do it without Fear or Doubt, To live an unstain'd Wife to my sweet Love. Fri. Mind Juliet, hie thee Home, get thee to Bed: (Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy Chamber:) And when thou art alone, take thou this Phial, And this distilled Liquor drink thou off, When presently thro' all thy Veins shall run A cold and drowsy Humour, which shall seize Each vital Spirit; for no Pulse shall keep His natural Progress, but surcease to beat; No Warmth, no Breath shall testify thou livest; And in this borrow'd Likeness of shrunk Death Thou shalt continue two and forty Hours, And then awake as from a pleasant Sleep, Now when the Bridegroom in the Morning comes To rouse thee from thy Bed, there art thou dead; Then as the Manner of our Country is, In thy best Robes uncover'd, on the Bier, Be borne to Burial in thy Kindred's Grave: Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient Vault Where all the Kindred of the Capulet's lie; In the mean time against thou shalt awake Shall Romeo by my Letters know our Drift, And hither shall he come; and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very Night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua; If no unconstant Toy nor womanish Fear Abate thy Valour in the acting it. Jul. Give me, oh give me, tell me not of Fear. Fri. Now get you gone, be strong and prosperous In this Resolve, I'll send a Friar with Speed To Mantua, with my Letters to thy Lord. Jul. Love give me Strength, and Strength shall Help afford. Farewell, dear Father. SCENE, Capulet's Garden. Enter Capulet, Lady, Capulet, Nurse, and two or three Servants. Cap. So many Guests invite as here are writ; What is my Daughter gone to Friar Laurence? Nurse. Ay, forsooth. Cap. Well, he may chance to do some good on her; A peevish self will'd Harlotry it is. Enter Juliet. Nurse. See where she comes from her Confession. Cap. How now my Head-strong? Where have you been gadding? Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the Sin Of disobedient Opposition To you and your Behests; and am enjoin'd By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here, And beg your Pardon: Pardon, I beseech you! Hence-forward I am ever rul'd by you. Cap. Send for the Count, go quick, tell him of this: I'll have this Knot knit up immediately. Jul. I met the youthful Lord at Laurence Cell, And gave him what becoming Love I might, Not stepping o'er the Bounds of Modesty. Cap. Why, I am glad on't; this is well. Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into the Closet, To help me sort such needful Ornaments, As you think fit to furnish me To-morrow? Cap. Go Nurse, go with her; we'll to Church 'ith' Morning. [Exeunt Jul. and Nurse. L. Cap. We shall be short in our Provisions; 'Tis now past Night. Cap. Tush, I'll stir about, And all Things shall be well, I warrant thee, Wife: Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her; I'll not to Bed To-night, let me alone: I'll play the Housewife for this once. What ho! They are all forth; well, I will walk my self To Paris, to prepare him up My Heart's wond'rous light, Since this same wayward Girl is so reclaim'd. [Exeunt. SCENE, Juliet's Chamber. Juliet and Nurse. Jul. Ay, those Attires are best; but, gentle Nurse, I pray thee leave me to my self To-night: For I have need of many Orisons To move the Heavens to smile upon my State, Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of Sin. Enter Lady Capulet. L. Cap. What, are you busy, do you need my Help? Jul. No, Madam; we have cull'd such Necessaries As are behoveful for our State To-morrow: So, please you, let me now be left alone, And let the Nurse this Night set up with you; For I am sure you have your Hands full all, In this so sudden Business. L. Cap. Good-night, Get thee to Bed and rest, for thou hast need. [Exeunt. Jul. FarewellâHeaven knows when we shall meet again! I have a faint cold Fear thrills thro' my Veins, That almost freezes up the Heat of Life. I'll call them back again to comfort me. Nurseâwhat shou'd she do here? My dismal Scene I needs must act alone: Come Phialâwhat if this Mixture do not work at all? Shall I of Force be married to the Count? No, no; this shall forbid it; lie thou there: [Conceals a Dagger under her Robe. What if it be a Poison, which the Friar Subt'ly hath ministred, to have me dead, Least in this Marriage he should be dishonour'd, Because he married me before to Romeo? I fear it is; and yet, methinks it shou'd not, For he hath still been try'd a holy Manâ How, if when I am laid into the Tomb, I 'wake before the Time that Romeo Comes to redeem me? There's a fearful Point! Shall I not then be stifled in the Vault, To whose foul Mouth no healthsome Air breathes in: Or, if I live, it is not very like The horrible Conceit of Death and Night, Together with the Terror of the Place, As in a Vault an ancient Receptacle, Where for these many hundred Years the Bones Of all my buried Ancestors are pack'd; Where bloody Tibalt, yet but green in Earth, Lies fest'ring in his Shroud, where as they say, At some Hours of the Night Spirits refortâ Alas! alas! is it not like, that I So early waking, what with loathsome Smells, And Shrieks like Mandrakes torn out of the Earth, That living Mortals hearing them run madâ Or, if I 'wake, shall I not be distraught, (Inviron'd with all these hideous Fears,) And madly play with my Forefathers Joints, And pluck the mangled Tibalt from his Shroud? And in this Rage, with some great Kinsman's Bone As with a Club, dash out my desp'rate Brains? O look! methinks I see my Cousin's Ghost Seeking out RomeoâTibalt, get thee gone, Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee. SCENE, a Hall. Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse. L. Cap. Hold, take these Keys, and fetch more Spices, Nurse. Nurse. They call for Dates and Quinces in the Pastry. Enter Capulet. Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir, the second Cock hath crowed, First Mattin's Bell hath rung, 'tis four o'Clock: Look to the bak'd Meats, good Angelica Spare not for Cost. L. Cap. Go, you Cot-Quean, go; Get you to-bed; faith you'll be sick To-morrow For this Night's watching. Cap. No not a whit; what I have watch'd ere now All Night for a less Cause, and ne'er been sick. L. Cap. Ay, you have been a Mouse-hunt in your Time, But I will watch you, from such watching, now. [Exit. L. Cap. and Nurse. Cap. A jealous-hood, a jealous-hoodâ Good faith 'tis Day Young Paris will be here with Musick strait, For so he said he would. I hear him near. Nurse, Wife, what ho? What Nurse I say? Enter Nurse. Go waken Juliet, go, and trim her up, I'll go and chat with Paris: Hie, make haste, Make haste, I say. [Exit. Cap. SCENE draws and discovers Juliet on a Bed. Nurse. Mistress, what Mistress! Julietâfast, I warrant her, Why Lambâwhy LadyâFie you slug-a-bedâ Oh! ho! what drest and in your Cloaths and down again! I must needs wake you, Lady, Lady, Lady,â Alas! alas! help! help! my Lady's dead, O well-a-day, that ever I was born? Enter Lady Capulet. L. Cap. What Noise is here? Nurse. O lamentable Day! L. Cap. What is the Matter? Nurse. Lookâoh heavy Day! L. Cap. Oh me, oh me, my Child, my only Life! Revive, look up, or I will die with thee. Enter Capulet. Cap. For Shame bring Juliet forth, her Lord is come. Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd, she's dead, alack the Day. Cap. Ha! let me see herâalas she's cold, Her Blood is settled and her Joints are stiff, Life and these Lips have long been separated: âDeath lies on her like an untimely Frost âUpon the sweetest Flower of the Field. Accursed Time! unfortunate old Man! Enter Friar Laurence and Paris, with Musicians. Fri. Come, is the Bride ready to go to Church? Cap. Ready to go, but never to return. O Son the Night before the Wedding-day Hath Death lain with thy Wife: See, there she lies, Flower as she was, deflower'd now by him: Death is my Son-in-law.â Paris. Have I thought long to see this Morning's Face, And doth it give me such a Sight as this? L. Cap. Most miserable Hour that Time e'er saw In lasting Labour of his Pilgrimage; But one Child to rejoice and solace in, And cruel Death hath caught it from my Sight. Nurse. Oh Woe most lamentable, most woeful Day. Fri. Peace, for shame! Cap. All things that we ordained Festival, Turn from their Office to black Funeral: Our Instruments to melancholy Bells; Our Wedding chear to a sad Funeral Feast: Our solemn Hymns to sullen Dirges change, And Bridal Flowers serve for a buried Coarse. Fri. Your Daughter lives in Peace and Happiness And it is vain to wish it otherwise, Heaven and yourself had part in this fair Maid, Now Heaven hath allâ Then as the Custom of our Country is, In all her best and sumptuous Ornaments Convey her where her Ancestors lie tomb'd. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE, near the Walls of Verona. Enter Romeo. Irksome Suspence creates perplexing Thoughts; Therefore no longer cou'd I rest in Mantua; But boldly have I ventured to Verona, Altho' it be at Hazard of my Life: 'Tis better know the worst, than be in doubt. Yet, if I trust the Flattery of Sleep, My Dreams presage some joyful News at hand: My Bosom's Lord sits lightly on his Throne, And ev'n now an unaccustom'd Spirit Lifts me above the Ground with chearful Thoughts. I dreamt my Lady came and found me dead, (Strange Dream that gives a dead Man leave to think) And breath'd such Life with Kisses in my Lips, That I revived, and was an Emperor. Ah, me! how sweet is Love itself possest, When but Love's Shadows are so rich in Joy? Why does my Servant slack his Expedition? Enter Romeo's Man. O! he returnsâHow now, Balthazar? Do'st thou not bring me Letters from the Friar? How doth my Lady? Is my Father well? How doth my Juliet? That I ask again, For nothing can be ill, if she be well. Bal. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill, Her Body sleeps in Capulet's Monument, And her immortal Part with Angels lives: I saw her laid low in her Kindred's Vault, And presently took Post to tell it you: O pardon me for bringing these ill News. Rom. Is it even so? Then I defy you, Stars! Haste thee, Balthazar, get me Ink and Paper, And meet me near the Abbey of St. Mary. Bal. Pardon me, Sir, I dare not leave you thus. Your Looks are pale and wild, and do import Some Misadventure. Rom. Tush, thou art deceived, Leave me, and do the Thing I bid thee do: Hast thou no Letters to me from the Friar? Bal. No, good my Lord. Rom. No Matter, get thee gone; See thou art speedy, I'll be with you strait. [Exit Bal. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee To-night, But for the MeansâO Mischief! thou art quick To enter in the Thought of desp'rate Men! âI do remember an Apothecary, âAnd hereabouts he dwells, whom late I noted âIn tattered Weeds, with overwhelming Brows, âCulling of Simples; meagre were his Looks, âSharp Misery had worn him to the Bones: âAnd in his needy Shop a Tortoise hung, âAn Alligator stuff'd, and other Skins âOf ill-shaped Fishes, and about his Shelves âA beggarly Account of empty Boxes, âGreen Earthen Pots, Bladders, and musty Seeds, âRemnants of Pack-thread, and old Cakes of Roses âWere thinly scatter'd to make up a Show.â Noting his Penury, to myself I said, And if a Man did need a Poison now, Whose Sale incurs the Penalty of Death, Here lives a Caitiff Wretch would sell it him. Oh this same Thought did but fore-run my Need, And this same needy Man must sell it me. As I remember, this should be the House. Being Holy-day, the Beggar's Shop is shut. What ho! Apothecary! Enter Apothecary. Apot. Who calls so loud? Rom. Come hither Man, I see that thou art poor; Behold, here's forty Ducats, let me have A Dram of Poison such soon-spreading Geer, As will disperse itself thro' all the Veins, That the Life-weary Taker may fall dead; And that the Trunk may be discharg'd of Breath, As violently as hasty Powder fired Doth hurry from the fatal Cannons Womb. Apot. Such mortal Drugs I have, but our Laws Speak Death to any he that utters them. Rom. Art thou so bare and full of Wretchedness, And fearest to die? Famine is in thy Cheeks, Need and Oppression stare within thine Eyes, Contempt and Beggary hang on thy Back: The World is not thy Friend, nor the World's Law; The World affords no Law to make thee rich: Then be not poor but break it, and take this. Apot. My Poverty, but not my Will, consents. [Exit. Rom. I pay thy Poverty, and not thy Will. Apot. returns. Put this in any liquid Thing you will, And drink it off, and if you had the Strength Of twenty Men, it wou'd dispatch you strait. Rom. There is the Gold, worse Poison to Men's Souls, Doing more Murder in this loathsome World, Than these poor Compounds that thou may'st not sell: I sell thee Poison, thou hast sold me none. Farewell, buy Food, and get thee into Flesh. And now for Juliet's Monument. SCENE, the Outside of the Convent. Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence. John. Holy Franciscan Friar, Brother! ho! Lau. This same should be the Voice of Friar John. Welcome from Mantua; what says Romeo? Or, if his Mind be writ, give me his Letter. John. Going to find a bare-foot Brother out, One of our Order, to associate me, Here in this City visiting the Sick; And finding him, the Searchers of the Town Suspecting that we both were in a House Where the infectious Pestilence did reign, Seal'd up the Doors, and wou'd not let us forth, So that my Speed to Mantua there was stay'd. Lau. Who bore my Letter then to Romeo? John. I could not send it; here it is again, Nor get a Messenger to bring it thee, So fearful were they of Infection. Lau. Unhappy Fortune! by my Brotherhood, The Letter was not nice, but full of Charge, Of dear Import, and the neglecting it May do much danger. Friar John, go hence Get me an Iron Crow, and bring it strait Unto my Cell. John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee. [Exit. Lau. Now must I to the Monument alone: Within these three Hours will fair Juliet wake; She will beshrew me much, that Romeo Hath had no notice of these Accidents: But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my Cell till Romeo come. Poor living Coarse, clos'd in a dead Man's Tomb. [Exit. SCENE, a Church-yard, in it several Monuments belonging to the Capulets. Enter Paris and his Page with a Torch. Paris. Boy.âUnder yond Yew-Tree lay thee all along, Laying thy Ear close to the hollow Ground; So shall no Foot upon the Church-Yard tread, (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of Graves) But thou shalt hear it: Whistle then to me, As Signal that thou hearest something approach. Give me those Flowers. Do as I bid thee; go. Page. I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the Church-Yard, yet I will venture. [Exit. Paris. Sweet Flower! with Flowers thy bridal Bed I strew; Fair Juliet, that with Angels dost remain, Accept this latest Favour at my Hand, That living honoured thee, and being dead With funeral Obsequies adorn thy Tomb. [The Boy whistles. The Boy gives warning, somthing doth approachâ What cursed Foot wanders this Way To-night, To cross my Obsequies and true Love's Rite? What with a Light? Muffle me, Night, a while. Enter Romeo and Balthazar with a Light. Rom. Give me the wrenching Iron. Take this Letter, early in the Morning See thou deliver it to my Lord and Father. Hang up the Light; upon thy Life, I charge thee, What e'er thou hear'st, or see'st, stand all aloof, And do not interrupt me in my Course. Why I descend into this Bed of Death Is partly to behold my Lady's Face: But chiefly to take thence from her dead Finger A precious Ring, a Ring that I must use In dear Employment; therefore hence be gone: But if thou jealous dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do, By Heaven I will tear thee Joint by Joint, And strew this hungry Church-Yard with thy Limbs; The Times and my Intents are savage, wild, More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty Tygers, or the roaring Sea. Bal. I will be gone, Sir, and not trouble you. Rom. So shalt thou win my Favour. Take thou that, Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good Fellow. Bal. For all this, I'll not move far: His Looks, I fear, and his Intents I doubt. [Exit. Rom. Thou destable Maw, thou Womb of Death. Gorged with the dearest Morsel of the Earth, This shall enforce thy rotten Joys to open, [Breaking open the Monument. And in despite, I'll cram thee with more Food. Paris. This is that banish'd haughty Mountague, That murder'd my Love's Cousin; (with which Grief It is supposed the fair Creature died) And here is come to do some villainous shame To the dead Bodies: I'll apprehend him, Stop thy unhallowed Toil vile Mountague. Can Vengeance be pursued further than Death? Condemned Villain, I do apprehend thee; Obey, and go with me, for thou must die. Rom. I must indeed, and therefore came I hitherâ Good gentle Youth, tempt not a desperate Man, Fly hence, and leave me. Think upon these gone. Let them affright thee! I beseech thee, Youth, Pull not another Sin upon my Head, By urging me to fury. O, be gone! By Heaven, I love thee better than myself; For I came hither arm'd against myself. Paris. I do defy thy Commiseration, And apprehend thee for a Felon here. Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, Boy. [They fight, Paris falls. Paris, Oh, I am slain! if thou be merciful, Open the Tomb, lay me with Juliet. Rom. In faith I will: Let me peruse this Faceâ Mercutio's Kinsman! Paris! Fare thee well. Since in Misfortune's Book with me thou art writ I'll bury thee in a triumphant Grave. For here lies JulietâOh my Love, my Wife, Death that hath suck'd the Honey of thy Breath, Hath had no Power yet upon thy Beauty That is not conquer'd, Beauty's Ensign yet Is crimson in thy Lips, and in thy Cheeks, And Death's pale Flag is not advanced there. Why art thou so fair? Shall I believe That unsubstantial Death is amorous, And that the lean abhorred Monster keeps Thee here in dark, to be his Paramour: For fear of that, I'll stay with thee for ever. Come bitter Conduct, thou unsavoury Guide: Here's to my Loveâ [Drinks the Poison. And now Eyes look your last, Arms take your last Embrace, whilst on these Lips I fix the Seal of an eternal Contractâ She breathes and stirs.â [Juliet wakes. Jul. In the Tomb. Where am I? Bless me, Heaven! 'Tis very cold: And yet here's something warmâ Rom. She lives, and we shall both be made immortal. Speak, speak my Juliet, speak some heavenly News, And tell me how the Gods design to treat us. Jul. O! I have slept a long ten thousand Years. What have they done with me? I'll not be us'd thus? I'll not wed Paris: Romeo is my Husband, Is he not, Sir? Methinks you're very like him. Be good as he is, and protect me. Rom. Juliet, Hah! Wilt thou not own me? Am I then but like him? Much, much indeed I'm chang'd from what I was; And ne'er shall be my self, if thou art lost. Jul. The Gods have heard my Vows; it is my Romeo. Once more they have restor'd him to my Eyes. Hadst thou not come, sure I had slept for ever. But there's a sovereign Charm in thy Embraces, That might do Wonders, and revive the Dead. Rom. Ill Fate no more, my Juliet, now shall part us, Nor cruel Parents, nor oppressing Laws. Did not Heav'n's Pow'rs all wonder at our Loves? And when thou told'st the Tale of thy Disasters, Was there not Sadness and a Gloom amongst 'em? I know there was; and they in pity sent thee, Thus to redeem me from this Vale of Torments, And bear me with thee to those Hills of Joys. This World's gross Air grows burthensome already. I'm all a God; such heav'nly Joys transport me, That mortal Sense grows sick, and faints with lasting. [Dies. Jul. Oh! to recount my Happiness to thee, To open all the Treasure of my Soul, And shew thee how 'tis fill'd, would waste more Time Than so impatient Love as mine can spare. He's gone! he's dead! breathless: Alas! my Romeo, A Phial too: here, here has been his Bane. O Churl! drink all? Not leave one friendly Drop For your poor Wife. Yet I'll drain thy Lips. Perhaps some welcome Poison may hang there, To help me to o'ertake thee on thy Journey. They're cold and damp as Earth. Hah! Stains of Blood! And a Man murder'd 'tis the unhappy Paris. Who fix their Joys on any Thing that's mortal, Let 'em behold my Portion and Despair. Oh! I could rend the Air with Lamentations, And rouse the dead up from their darksome Graves, Let Heart felt Rage, Distraction, and Despair, Seize all the World till they grow mad as I am. Watch. Within. Lead Boy. Which way? Jul. What Noise is thatâI will have no Prevention. Then I'll be brief. Come well-secreted Dagger. [Stabs herself. This is thy Sheath, there rust and let me die? 'Tis o'er;âmy Eyes grow dim. Where is my Love? Have I caught you! now, now, we'll part no more. [Falls on Romeo, and dies. Enter a Page with Watch, &amp;c. Page. This is the Place where yonder Light doth burn. Watch. The Ground is bloody. Search all about the Church; Go some of you, whom e'er you find attack. Go tell the Prince, run to the Capulets, Raise up the Mountagues, some others searchâ Enter some of the Watch with Romeo's Man. 2d Watch. Here's Romeo's Man, we found him in the Church-yard. 1st Watch. Hold him in Safety till the Prince comes hither. Enter Friar, and a third Watchman. 3d Watch. Here's a Friar, from whom we took this Iron and this Spade. 1st Watch. Stay the Friar too. Let none escape. Friar , looking on the Bodies. Juliet, I came to free thee from the Grave, But little thought to find thee fast in Death. What! Romeo too? Ill-fated lovely Pair. Oh! dire Effect of most unhappy Error! Enter the Prince, and Attendants. Prince. What Misadventure is so early up, That calls our Person from our Morning's Rest? Enter Capulet, and Lady Capulet. Cap. What should it be that they so shriek abroad? L. Cap. The People in the Street cry Romeo, Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run With open Outcry toward our Monument. Prince. What Fear is this that startles in your Ears? 1st Watch. Sovereign, here lies noble Lord Paris slain, and Romeo dead, and Juliet warm and new kill'd. Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul Murder comes. Watch. Here is a Friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's Man, with Instruments upon them fit to open these dead Men's Tombs. Cap. Oh Heaven! oh Wife, look how our Daughter bleeds! Oh me! this Sight of Death is as a Bell, That warns my old Age to a Sepulchre. Enter Mountague. Prince. Lord Mountague, thou art full early up, To see thy Son and Heir now early fallen. Mount. Alas! my Liege, my Wife is dead Tonight, Grief of my Son's Exile hath stopt her Breath. What further Woe conspires against my Age? Prince. Look where thy Son lies dead. Mount. O thou untaught! what Manners is in this, To press before thy Father to a Grave? Prince. Seal up the Mouth of Outrage for a while, 'Till we can clear these Ambiguities, And let Mischance be Slave to Patience. Bring forth the Parties of Suspicion. Fri. I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected as the Time and Place Doth make against me, of this direful Murder; And here I stand both to impeach and purge; My self condemned, and my self excus'd. Prince. Then say at once what thou dost know in this. Fri. Romeo, there dead, was Husband to that Juliet. I married them; to which her Nurse was witness. Early next Day fair Juliet comes to me, And with wild Looks bid me devise some Means, Which might prevent her Marriage with young Paris, Or in my Cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her (so tutor'd by my Art) A sleeping Potion, which so took Effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The Form of Death. Meantime I write to Romeo, That he should hither come as this dire Night, To help to take her from her borrowed Grave; Being the Time the Potion's Force should cease. But he which bore my Letter, Friar John, Was stay'd by Accident; and Yesternight Return'd my Letter back; then all alone, At the prefixed Hour of her awaking, Came I, to take her from her Kindred's Vault; Meaning to keep her closely at my Cell, 'Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. If this be not the Truth, let my old Life Be sacrificed some Hours before its Time, Unto the Rigour of severest Law. Prince. We still have known thee for a holy Man. Where's Balthazar, what can he say to this? Bal. I brought my Master News of Juliet's Death, And then he came to this same Monument: This Letter he bid me early give his Father, And threat'ned me with Death going to the Vault, If I departed not, and left him there. Prince. Give me the Letter, I will look on it. Where is Count Paris' Page that rais'd the Watch? What brought your Master to this Place To-night? Page. He came with Flowers to strew his Lady's Grave, And bid me stand aloof; and so I did. Anon comes one with Light to ope the Tomb, And by and by my Master drew on him; And then I ran away to call the Watch. Prince. This Letter doth make good the Friar's Words, Their Course of Love, the Tidings of her Death: And here he writes, that he did buy a Poison Of a poor Apothecary, and therewithal Came to this Vault to lie with Juliet. Where be these Enemies Capulet! and Mountague? See what a Scourge is laid upon your Hate, That Heaven finds Means to kill your Joys with Love: And I for winking at your Discords too, Have lost a Brace of Kinsmen: All are punish'd. Lord Mountague give Capulet thy Hand, And let all Hate be buried in this Tomb. Cap. This is my Daughter's Jointure; for no more Can I demand. Mount. But I can give thee more; For I will raise her Statue in pure Gold, That while Verona by that Name is known, There shall no Figure at that Rate be set, As that of true and faithful Juliet. Cap. As rich shall Romeo by his Lady lie, Poor Sacrifices of our Amity. Prince. A gloomy Peace this Morning with it brings, The Sun for Sorrow will not shew its Head: We'll hence to enquire farther of these Facts; And, as the Law directs, pardon or punish. Never true Lovers Story did impart More real Anguish to a humane Heart. FINIS.</field>
