      <field name="fulltext">His Mt i e being set, Entreth in, running, JOHPHIEL, an aêry spirit, and (according to the Magi) the Intelligence of Jupiters sphere: Attired in light silkes of severall colours, with wings of the same, a bright yellow haire, a chaplet of flowers, blew silke stockings, and pumpes, and gloves, with a silver fan in his hand. JOHPHIEL. Like a lightning from the skie, Or an arrow shot by Love, Or a Bird of his let fly; Bee't a Sparrow, or a Dove: With that winged hast, come I, Loosed from the Sphere of Iove, To wish good-night To your delight. To him enters a Melancholique Student, in bare and worne cloathes, shrowded under an obscure cloake, and the eaves of an old hat, fetching a deepe sigh, his name, Mr. Mere-Foole. Mere-Foole. Oh, oh! Johphiel. In Saturn's name, the Father of my Lord! What over-charged piece of Melancholie Is this, breakes in betweene my wishes thus, With bombing sighes? Mere-Foole. No! no Intelligence! Not yet! and all my vowes now nine dayes old! Blindnesse of fate! Puppies had seene by this time: But I see nothing! that I should! or would see! What meane the Brethren of the Rosie-Crosse So to desert their votarie! Johphiel. O! 'tis one Hath vow'd himselfe unto that aërie order, And now is gaping for the flie they promis'd him. I'le mixe a little with him for my sport. Mere-Foole. Have I both in my lodging, and my dyet, My cloathes, and every other solemne charge Observ'd 'hem! made the naked bords my bed! A fagot for my pillow! hungred sore! Johphiel. And thirsted after 'hem! Mere-Foole. To looke gaunt, and leane! Johphiel. Which will not be. Mere-Foole. (Who's that?) yes, and outwatcht, Yea, and out-walked any Ghost alive Insolitarie circle, worne my bootes, Knees, armes, and elbowes out! Johphiel. Ran on the score! Mere-Foole. That have I (who suggests that?) and for more Then I will speake of, to abate this flesh, And have not gaind the sight; Johphiel. Nay scarce the sense. Mere-Foole. (Voice, thou art right) of any thing but a cold Wind in my stomacke. Johphiel. And a kind of whimsie. Mere-Foole. Here in my head, that puts me to the staggers, Whether there be that Brotherhood, or no. Johphiel. Beleeve fraile man, they be: and thou shalt see. Mere-Foole. What shall I see? Johphiel. Mee. Mere-Foole. Thee? Where? Johphiel. Here. If you Be Mr. Mere-Foole. Mere-Foole. Sir, our name is Mery-Foole. But by contraction Mere-foole. Johphiel. Then are you The wight I seeke: and Sr. my name is Jophiel, Intelligence to the Sphere of Jupiter, An aëry jocular spirit, employ'd to you From Father Ovtis. Mere-Foole. Ovtis? who is hee? Johphiel. Know yee not Ovtis? Then you know Nobody: The good old Hermit, that was said to dwell Here in the forrest without trees, that built The Castle in the aire, where all the Brethren Rhodostaurotick live. It flyes with wings, And runnes on wheeles: where Julian de Campis Holds out the brandisht blade. Mere-Foole. Is't possible They thinke on mee? Johphiel. Rise, be not lost in wonder, But heare me, and be faithfull. All the Brethren Have heard your vowes, salute you, and expect you, By me, this next returne. But the good Father Has bin content to die for you. Mere-Foole: For mee? Johphiel. For you. Last New-yeares day, which some give out, Because it was his Birth-day, and began The yeare of Jubile, he would rest upon it, Being his hundred five and twentieth yeare: But the truth is, having observ'd your Genesis, He would not live, because he might leave all He had to you. Mere-Foole. What had he? Johphiel. Had? An office, Two, three, or foure. Mere-Foole. Where? Johphiel. In the upper Region: And that you'll find. The Farme of the great Customes, Through all the Ports of the Aires Intelligences; Then Constable of the Castle Rosie-Crosse: Which you must be, and Keeper of the Keyes Of the whole Kaball, with the Seales; you shall be Principall Secretarie to the Starres; Know all their signatures, and combinations, The divine rods, and consecrated roots. What not? Would you turne trees up like the wind, To shew your strength? march ouer heads of armies, Or points of pikes, to shew your lightnesse? force All doores of arts, with the petarre, of your wit? Reade at one view all bookes? speake all the languages Of severall creatures? master all the learnings Were, are, or shall be? or, to shew your wealth, Open all treasures, hid by nature, from The rocke of Diamond, to the mine of Sea-coale? Sir, you shall doe it. Mere-Foole. But how? Johphiel. Why, by his skill, Of which he has left you the inheritance, Here in a pot: this little gally pot Of tincture, high rose tincture. There's your Order, You will ha' your Collar sent you, er't be long. Mere-Foole. I lookt Sir, for a halter, I was desperate. Johphiel. Reach forth your hand. Mere-Foole. O Sir, a broken sleeve Keepes the arme back as 'tis i'the proverbe. Johphiel. Nay, For that I doe commend you: you must be poore With all your wealth, and learning. When you ha'made Your glasses, gardens in the depth of Winter, Where you will walke invisible to Man-kind, Talkt with all birds and beasts in their owne language, When you have penetrated hills like ayre, Div'd to the bottome of the Sea, like leade And riss' againe like corke, walk't in the fire An 'twere a Salamander, pass'd through all The winding orbes, like an Intelligence, Up to the Empyreum, when you have made The World your gallery, can dispatch a businesse In some three minutes, with the Antipodes, And in five more, negotiate the Globe over; You must be poore still. Mere-Foole. By my place, I know it. Johphiel. Where would you wish to be now? or what to see? Without the fortunate purse to beare your charges, Or wishing hat? I will but touch your temples, The corners of your eyes, and tinct the tip, The very tip o'your nose, with this Collyrium And you shall see i'the ayre all the Idea's, Spirits, and Atomes, Flies, that buz about This way, and that way, and are rather admirable, Then any way intelligible. Mere-Foole. O, come, tinct me, Tinct me: I long, save this great belly, I long. But shall I onely see? Johphiel. See, and command As they were all your varlets, or your foot-boyes: But first you must declare, (your greatnesse must, For that is now your stile) what you would see. Or whom. Mere-Foole. Is that my stile? My Greatnesse, then, Would see King Zoroastres. Johphiel. Why you shall: Or any one beside. Thinke whom you please? Your thousand, Your ten thousand, to a million: All's one to me, if you could name a myriad. Mere-Foole. I have nam'd him. Johphiel. You'ave reason. Mere-Foole. I, I have reason. Because he's said to be the Father of conjurers, And a cunning man i'the starres. Johphiel. I, that's it troubles us. A little for the present: For, at this time He is confuting a French Almanack, But he will straight have done, Ha'you but patience, Or thinke but any other in meane time, Any hard name. Mere-Foole. Then, Hermes Trismegistus. Johphiel. O, ? ????????????? Why, you shall see him, A fine hard name. Or him, or whom you will, As I said to you afore. Or what doe you thinke Of Howle-glasse, instead of him. Mere-Foole. No, him I have a mind to. Johphiel. O', but Vlen-spiegle. Were such a name! but you shall have your longing. What lucke is this, he should be busie too? He is waighing water, but to fill three houre-glasses, And market the day in pen'orths like a cheese, And he has done. 'Tis strange you should name him Of all the rest! there being Famblicus, Or Porphyrie, or Proclus, any name That is not busie. Mere-Foole. Let me see Pythagoras. Johphiel. Good. Mere-Foole. Or Plato. Johphiel. Plato, is framing some Idea's, Are now bespoken, at a groat a dozen, Three grosse at least: And, for Pythagoras, He' has rashly run himselfe on an imployment, Of keeping Asses from a field of beanes; And cannot be stav'd off. Mere-Foole. Then, Archimedes. Johphiel. Yes, Archimedes! Mere-Foole. I, or Æsope. Johphiel. Nay, Hold your first man, a good man, Archimedes, And worthy to be seene; but he is now Inventing a rare Mouse-trap with Owles wings And a Catts-foot, to catch the Mise alone: And Æsop, he is filing a Fox tongue, For a new fable he has made of Court; But you shall see 'hem all, stay but your time And aske in season; Things as'kd out of season A man denies himselfe. At such a time As Christmas, when disguising is o'foot, To aske of the inventions, and the men, The witts, and the ingines that move those Orbes! Me thinkes, you should enquire now, after Skelton, Or Mr. Skogan. Mere-Foole. Skogan? what was he? Johphiel. O' a fine Gentleman, and a Master of Arts, Of Henry the fourth's times, that made disguises For the Kings sonnes, and writ in ballad-royall Daintily well. Mere-Foole. But, wrote he like a Gentleman? Johphiel. In rime! fine tinckling rime! and flowand verse! With now and then some sence! and he was paid for't, Regarded, and rewarded: which few Poets Are now adaies. Mere-Foole. And why? Johphiel. 'Cause every Dabler In rime is thought the same. But you shall see him. Hold up your nose. Mere-Foole. I had rather see a Brachman, Or a Gymnosophist yet. Johphiel. You shall see him, Sir. Is worth them both. And with him Damine Skelton, The worshipfull Poet Laureat to K. Harry, And Tytire tu of those times. Advance quick Skogan, And quicker Skelton, shew your craftie heads, Before this Heire of arts, this Lord of learning, This Master of all knowledge in reversion. Enter SKOGAN, and SKELTON in like habits, as they liv'd. Skogan. Seemeth we are call'd of a morall intent, If the words that are spoken, as well now be meant. Johphiel. That Mr. Skogan I dare you ensure. Skogan. Then, Sonne, our acquaintance is like to indure. Mere-Foole. A pretty game! like Crambe. Mr. Skogan, Give me thy hand: Thou'rt very leane, me thinks, Is't living by thy wits? Skogan. If it had beene that, My worshipfull Sonne, thou hadst ne're bin so fat. Johphiel. He tels you true Sir. Here's a Gentleman (My paire of crafty Clerkes) of that high caract, As hardly hath the age produc't his like. Who not content with the wit of his owne times, Is curious to know yours, and what hath beene, Mere-Foole. Or is, or shall be. Johphiel. Note his Latitude! Skelton. O, vir amplissimus! (Ut scholis dicimus) Et gentilissimus! Johphiel. The question-issimus Is, should he aske a sight now, for his life; I meane, a person, he would have restor'd, To memorie of these times, for a Play-fellow, Whether you would present him, with an Hermes, Or, with an Howle-glas? Skelton. An Howleglasse To come, to passe On his Fathers Asse; There never was, By day, nor night, A finer sight. With feathers upright In his horned cap, And crooked shape, Much like an Ape. With Owle on fist, And Glasse at his wrist. Skogan. Except the foure Knaves entertain'd for the guards, Of the Kings, and the Queenes that triumph in the cards. Johphiel I, that were a sight and a halfe, I confesse, To see 'hem come skipping in, all at a messe! Skelton. With Elinor Rumming. To make up the mumming, That comely Gill, That dwelt on a hill, But she is not grill: Her face all bowsie, Droopie, and drowsie, Scurvy, and lowsie, Comely crinkled, Wondrously wrinkled, Like a rost pigs eare, Bristled with haire. Scogan. Or, what doe you say to Ruffian Fitz-Ale? Johphiel. An excellent sight, if he be not to stale. But then, we can mix him with moderne Vapors, The Child of Tobacco, his pipes, and his papers. Mere-Foole. You talk'd of Elinor Rumming, I had rather See Ellen of Troy. Johphiel. Her you shall see. But credit mee, That Marie Ambree (Who march'd so free. To the siege of Gaunt, And death could not daunt, As the Ballad doth vaunt) Were a braver wight, And a better sight. Skelton. Or Westminster Meg, With her long leg, As long as a Crane; And feet like a plane: With a paire of heeles, As broad as two wheeles; To drive downe the dew, As she goes to the stew: And turnes home merry, By Lambeth Ferry. Or you may have come In, Thomas Thumbe, In a pudding fatt With Doctor Ratt. Johphiel. I, that! that! that! Wee'll have'em all, To fill the Hall. The Antimasque followes. Consisting of these twelve persons, Owleglasse, the foure Knaves, two Ruffians, Fitz-ale, and Vapore, Elnor Rumming, Mary Ambree, Long-Meg of Westminster, Tom Thumbe, and Doctor Ratt. Which done, Mere-Foole. What! are they vanish'd! where is skipping Skelton? Or morall Skogan? I doe like their shew And would have thankt'em, being the first grace The Company of the Rosie-Crosse hath done me. Johphiel. The company o'the Rosie-Crosse! you wigion, The company of Players. Goe, you are, And will be still your selfe, a Mere-foole, In; And take your pot of honey here, and hogs greace, See, who has guld you, and make one. Great King, Your pardon, if desire to please have trespass'd. This foole should have beene sent to Antycira, (The Ile of Ellebore) there to have purg'd, Not hop'd a happie seat within your waters. Heare now the message of the Fates, and Jove, On whom those Fates depend, to you, as Neptune The great Commander of the Seas, and Iles. That point of Revolution being come When all the Fortunate Islands should be joyn'd, Macaria, one, and thought a Principall, That hitherto hath floted, as uncertaine Where she should fix her blessings, is to night Instructed to adhere to your Britannia: That where the happie spirits live, hereafter Might be no question made, by the most curious, Since the Macarij come to doe you homage, And joyne their cradle to your continent. Here the Scene opens, and the Masquers are discover'd sitting in their severall seiges. The ayre opens above, and Apollo with Harmony, and the spirits of Musique sing, the while the Iland moves forward, Proteus sitting below, and hearkening. SONG. Looke forth the Shepheard of the Seas, And of the Ports that keepe the keyes, And to your Neptune tell, Macaria, Prince of all the Isles, Wherein there nothing growes, but smiles, Doth here put in, to dwell. The windes are sweet, and gently blow, But Zephirus, no breath they know, The Father of the flowers: By him the virgin violets live, And every plant doth odours give, As new, as are the howers. Chorvs. Then, thinke it not a common cause, That to it so much wonder drawes, And all the heavens consent, With Harmony to tune their notes, In answers to the publike votes, That for it up were sent. By this time, the Iland having joyned it selfe to the shore; Protevs, Portvnvs, and Saron come forth, and goe up singing to the State, while the Masquers take time to ranke themselves. Song. Protevs. I, now, the heights of Neptunes honours shine, And all the glories of his greater stile Are read, reflected in this happiest Ile. Portvnvs. How both the ayre, the soyle, the seat combine To speake it blessed! Saron. These are the true groves, Where joyes are borne. Protevs. Where longings, Portvnvs. And where loves! Saron. That live! Protevs. That last! Portvnvs. No intermitted wind Blowes here, but what leaves flowers, or fruit behind. Chorvs. 'Tis odour all, that comes! And every tree doth give his gummes. Protevs. There is no sicknesse, nor no old age knowne To man, nor any griefe that hee dares owne. There is no hunger there, nor envy of state. Nor least ambition in the Magistrate. But all are even-hearted, open, free, And what one is, another strives to be. Portvnvs. Here all the day, they feast, they sport, and spring; Now dance the Graces Hay; now Venus Ring: To which the old Musitians play, and sing. Saron. There is Arion, tuning his bold Harpe, from flat to sharpe. Portvnvs. And light Anacreon, He still is one! Protevs. Stesichorus there, too, That Linus, and old Orpheus doth out-doe To wonder. Saron. And Amphion! he is there. Portvnvs. Nor is Apollo dainty to appeare In such a quire, although the trees be thick, Protevs. He will looke in, and see the aires be quick, And that the times be true. Portvnvs. Then, chanting, Protevs. Then, Up, with their notes, they raise the Prince of Men. Saron. And sing the present Prophecie that goes Of joyning the bright Lillie, and the Rose. Chorvs. See! all the flowers Protevs. That spring the banks along, Doe move their heads unto that under-song. Chorvs. Saron, Portvnvs, Protevs, helpe to bring Our Primrose in, the glory of the spring! And tell the Daffadill, against that day, That we prepare new Gyrlands fresh as May. And enter-weave the Myrtle, and the Bay. This sung, the Island goes backe, whil'st the upper Chorus takes it from them, and the Masquers prepare for their figure. Chorvs. Spring all the Graces of the age, And all the Loves of time; Bring all the pleasures of the stage, And relishes of rime: Adde all the softnesses of Courts, The lookes, the laughters, and the sports. And mingle all their sweets, and salts, That none may say, the Triumph halts. The Masquers Dance their Entry or first dance. Which done, the first Prospective, a Maritime Palace, or the house of Oceanus is discovered to loude Musicke. The other above is no more seene. Johphiel. Behold the Palace of Oceanus! Hayle Reverend structure! Boast no more to us Thy being able, all the Gods to feast; We saw enough: when Albion was thy guest. The Measures. After which, the second Prospective, a Sea is showne, to the former Musicke. Johphiel. Now turne; and view the wonders of the deepe, Where Proteus Herds, and Neptunes Orkes doe keepe, Where all is plough'd, yet still the pastures greene New wayes are found, and yet no paths are seene. Here Proteus, Portunus, Saron, goe up to the Ladyes with this Song. Protevs. Come noble Nymphs, and doe not hide The joyes, for which you so provide: Saron. If not to mingle with the Men, What doe you here? Goe home agen. Portvnvs. Your dressings doe confesse, By what we see, so curious parts Of Pallas, and Arachnes arts, That you could meane no lesse. Protevs. Why doe you weare the Silk-wormes toyles, Or glory in the shell-fish spoyles; Or strive to shew the graines of Ore That you have gather'd on the shore, whereof to make a stocke To graft the greener Emerald on, Or any better water'd stone, Saron. Or Rubie of the Rocke? Protevs. Why doe you smell of Amber-gris, Of which was formed Neptunes Neice, The Queene of Love: unlesse you can Like Sea-borne Venus love a Man? Saron. Try, put your selves unto't. Chorvs. Your lookes, your smiles, and thoughts that meet, Ambrosian hands, and silver feet, Doe promise you will do't. The Revells follow. Which ended, the Fleet is discovered, while the three Corners play. Johphiel. 'Tis time, your eyes should be refresht at length With something new, a part of Neptvnes strength, See yond', his Fleete, ready to goe or come, Or fetch the riches of the Ocean home, So to secure him, both in peace, and warres, Till not one ship alone, but all be starres. Then the last Song. Protevs. Although we wish the glory still might last Of such a night, and for the causes past: Yet now, great Lord of waters, and of Iles, Give Proteus leave to turne unto his wiles. Portvnvs. And, whilst young Albion doth thy labours ease, Dispatch Portunus to the Ports. Saron. And Saron to the Seas: To meet old Nereus, with his fiftie girles, From aged Indus laden home with pearles, And Orient gummes, to burne unto thy name. Chorvs. And may thy subjects hearts be all on flame, Whil'st thou dost keepe the earth in firme estate, And 'mongst the winds, do'st suffer no debate, But both at Sea, and Land, our powers increase, With health, and all the golden gifts of Peace. After which, their last Dance. The End.</field>
