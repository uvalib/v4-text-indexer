      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Don Alonzo de Castro,—The Patriarch Don Felix d'Almeyda,—His Friend Father Gabriel, the Inquisitor,—Brother to Felix Mordaunt—An Englishman Don Antonio—His Friend Diego,—A Servant of the Patriarch's Donna Elvira—Niece to the Patriarch Donna Clara—Her Friend Officers, Servants, &amp;c. &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE. THE PATRIARCH'S PALACE NEAR LISBON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Enter Antonio and Clara. Antonio. Say, is Elvira here? Cla. She is:—but tell me What sadness clouds your brow? Ant. Alas! I cannot. Cla. What mean these half-form'd words?—your looks alarm me! O speak, and calm my fears! Ant. How shall we pour The fatal tidings in Elvira's ears? Cla. Elvira, said you?—heav'ns! your friend is absent. Has aught befallen him? Ant. In a dungeon's gloom He lies confin'd.—The sons of Persecution Have shut him from the day. Cla. Impossible!— The mild, the gentle Mordaunt! Say—Can he, Whose candid bosom breath'd benevolence, Have given an insult to our Holy Faith, Or mock'd its ministers? Ant. Hear, then, the tale:— The noble youth, his countryman and friend, Companion of his travels—fell a victim To that destructive demon, which too oft Has stain'd our streets with blood—the murd'rer fled; And Mordaunt, with assiduous care, convey'd His bleeding friend to the first roof. The priests, With pious zeal, officious croud the room. In vain did weeping Mordaunt try to show His different faith: The holy zealots, eager To make a proselyte, at once surround The dying youth. Cla. Ah! Now I see the horrors Of Mordaunt's rashness: Gentle, tho' he is, I know his gen'rous warmth, his ardent friendship Will hurry him beyond the bounds of reason. O blind effect of Prejudice and Pride!— E'en in the mildest breasts. His frenzy, then, Our Holy Faith insulted? Ant. Not so harshly Judge of my friend. Gentle, as vernal showers, Fell soft Persuasion's accents from his tongue. But all his efforts, all his calm endeavours To free his friend from the surrounding croud; To take his dying words, his last embrace; The holy ruffians constru'd into insult: The guards were summon'd; and, with savage force, They tore him, struggling, from th'expiring youth; His death embitter'd by the cruel outrage. Cla. And could you leave him thus? Ant. I tried in vain To stem their violence; my interference Had nearly cost me dear: Deem'd an accomplice, And dragg'd before the Holy Office—hardly Escap'd I from their rage. Cla. And will not Mordaunt Be also clear'd, when full investigation Shall prove his innocence? Ant. That he is innocent Admits not doubt.—Yet is there cause for fear. Too well you know Gabriel's malevolence: By him was I examin'd; and I clearly, Thro' the affected candour of his words, Could read the fix'd aversion of his soul To my brave English friend. He more than hinted That Mordaunt's interference had prevented The dying youth from breathing out his soul In our Most Holy Faith: And such a charge, In Lisbon's walls, will never pass unpunish'd. Cla. That meddling churlish priest has ever held Th'unhappy youth his foe.—But this is not A time for idle reasoning: we must strain Each nerve to gain his freedom.—Poor Elvira! How will she suffer!—how shall words convey This dread event to her? Ant. Ah wretched maid! How shall her gentle mind, awake to all The feelings of distress, support this blow! —Can we conceal it from her? Cla. 'Twill be vain To hope it!—Will the penetrating eye Of Love be so eluded? She will read Our anguish in our looks; and vivid fancy Will paint the cause with aggravated horrors. —But hark! what sounds of woe! Enter Diego. Diego. Elvira's dying For Heav'n's sake, help! Clara. What mean your frantic cries? Diego. Breathless and pale she lies—this fatal tale! [Exit Clara. Ant. She knows it, then—Didst thou disclose it? Diego. Sir, Too sure I did, yet far from such intent. With anxious voice, she ask'd why Mordaunt staid; And, as I hesitating stood, her eye Scanning my inmost thoughts. Confus'd and trembling, I knew not what I said; she urg'd me closely; And I— Ant. Unlucky chance!—How did she bear The dreadful news? Diego. At first; beyond my hopes. Dry were her eyes, while mine o'erflow'd with tears. —Indeed, her colour left her cheek. Ant. Alas! What, poor Elvira, were thy tortures then! Diego. Silent and motionless as Death she stood, Till my sad tale was o'er: then, turning round, And veiling with a smile her struggling sighs, She try'd to speak, but, on her fault'ring tongue, The feeble accents died; and, to the ground, She breathless sunk before us. Ant. Oh! thy folly Has plung'd a dagger in Elvira's bosom! —But see, she comes! the lovely mourner comes. Enter Elvira and Clara. Elv. My best, my tend'rest friend, forbear to weep. I have no cause for grief.—'Tis true, at first The shock o'erpow'r'd my reason; but 'tis past— My breast is now at peace,—indeed it is: Why do you weep? Clara. Oh! try to bear against This storm of sorrow. Elv. Wherefore that advice? Do I not bear it—say? Am I not calm? Do I not know that, tho' I have been happy, Calamity's the lot of human kind? What can I more?— [bursts into tears. Cla. Dearest and best of friends, What can I say to soothe your stormy sorrows? —Would I could bear them; Elv. Do'nt I bear them firmly? Is not my bosom calm? Are not my eyes Unfill'd with tears? Cla. Ah! alas, my lov'd Elvira! This is not firmness;—'tis the stunning blow Of deep despair. Compose your ruffled spirits— Support her failing limbs. Elv. [Recovering herself.] My dearest friends, I feel your kind concern, and I will try To check this weakness.—Shall my selfish bosom Yield up entirely to its own distress, Regardless of your suff'rings?—Let me change The painful subject—Say, my gentle Clara, Have you forgot the dreadful scene of danger; When the wild bull, inflam'd by wounds and rage, Leaping the barrier, rush'd infuriate on To our Veranda—Death was in our view, When, swifter than our fears, the gallant Mordaunt Flew to our rescue; threw himself before us; Oppos'd his body to the furious savage; And brought him with his falchion to the ground! And must this gen'rous youth,—ungrateful Lisbon! Expiate a deed of mercy with his life? Is friendship in your walls become a crime? Say, good Antonio, is the wretched captive Alone—no voice to soothe the hours of anguish? Has he no friend? Have you forsaken him? Ant. At his request, I left him; he preferr'd His solitary sorrows.—Fly, he cried, Fly to my lov'd Elvira, lest the fate Of her unhappy votary break too roughly On her soft frame. I cannot be alone While my warm bosom holds Elvira's image, Elv. Ah virtuous Mordaunt!—But, Antonio, tell me Where are my letters; where those faithful portraits Of my affection—Heav'ns!—are they expos'd To sacrilegious eyes? Ant. Too sure they are. The Holy Office seiz'd on all his papers. They cannot have escap'd. Elv. It must be so. Yes! let me now resolve to meet the stroke That cannot be eluded.—To my uncle, The mild, the just Alonzo, I must now Unfold the whole; ere from the partial voice Of prejudice and malice he receive it. Yes! I will instant seek him—I will throw My trembling wrongs before his feet; and move him With all the eloquence of misery. My tears shall plead our cause. Cla. Those tears, Elvira, Will choke your utterance—torn by fear and anguish, How will you to the Patriarch's ear explain The source of your affection?—trace the spring Of this your secret passion; which, howe'er On truth and reason founded, will to him Seem the wild offspring of capricious fancy, The vision of a moment, that has wean'd Your wav'ring spirit from the love of heav'n; Where still, whenever Felix' suit was urg'd, You said your vows were fix'd.—Better some friend Should take this office; and, with cool persuasion, Prepare his mind to hear it. Elv. No, my Clara: The voice of Grief is ever most persuasive To feeling minds; and well I know the bosom Of good Alonzo is the seat of pity. Oft' have I seen his eyes with kindred drops Melt o'er a tale of wo; and once to me He own'd, ere yet the Church receiv'd his vows, He, too, had bow'd to Love's resistless pow'r; He, too, had form'd a tie, which cruel Fate Untimely sever'd. I with tears unfeign'd Repaid his confidence.—He kiss'd them from me, Wrung with parental tenderness my hand, And, sighing, breath'd his fondest blessings on me. —I know my griefs will move him. Cla. Yet at least Let me attend your steps. Elv. No! I will go Alone. Adieu!—I know your prayers attend me. [Going. A moment, yet—Antonio, tell me truly; Know you the dungeon's keeper?—Is he cruel?— Have frequent scenes of horror steel'd his bosom To Mercy's gentle voice? Ant. I know him not; Yet let us hope the best. Elv. The flatterer Hope Soothes too my fears.—He must indeed be cruel, To injure Mordaunt. Yet my boding thoughts Paint him pale, helpless, chain'd.—Horrid idea! Shall fetters gall that gallant arm which sav'd me? Oh!—I shall be distracted!—Yet forgive— Forgive the wanderings of disorder'd reason; I will, I will be calm.—Adieu! my Clara. [Exit. Cla. May Heav'n assist her suit!—The Patriarch's heart I know is gentle, and his love for her Equals a parent's:—Yet, to find his views (Which long have destin'd her to noble Felix) Cross'd in a moment thus; and by a youth Unknown, unfriended.—Much I dread th'event. Then, that malicious churchman—haughty Gabriel; His heart is capable of every crime: Nor will he hesitate at aught to ruin His brother's happy rival. Ant. His ambition I know too well Cla. 'Tis from that principle Alone, he urges thus the suit of Felix To my unhappy friend. A brother's feelings, The gen'rous sympathy which wakes affection In kindred minds, have surely not inspir'd This zeal to aid his love; for never yet Were tempers more discordant: Felix boasts A heart as noble and a soul as! open As ever glow'd within a soldier's bosom; While this base Monk is dead to ev'ry sense That centers not in self. Ant. Elvira's wealth, Her race, and near alliance with the Patriarch, Are such inducements to that priest's ambition;— That, be assur'd, no means will be omitted That Cruelty can frame or Hell suggest, To forward Felix' nuptials, and destroy All who shall cross his darling scheme of greatness. Enter Diego. Dieg. O Sir, he comes! Ant. Who? Dieg. Mordaunt. Ant. Peace: You dream. Cla. It cannot be, your eyes must have deceiv'd you. Die. I saw him cross the court; and see, he's here. Enter Mordaunt. Ant. O let me clasp him to my breast!—My friend, And are you free indeed? Mor. Yes, for a moment! O Clara! O Antonio! But—Elvira! Where is she? Can I see her? Ant. She is gone, This instant gone to seek the Patriarch; own Your mutual passion; plead her cause before him; And sue for your enlargement. Mor. Then she's well, And I am truly happy!—Is the Patriarch Now in the palace? Ant. No, he is at Bellem, Sent for by special mandate from the king Each moment he's expected. Cla. Tell me, Mordaunt, By what auspicious accident our wishes Are thus prevented:—By what happy means Gain'd you your freedom? Mor. By my own exertion.— From the high turret of the northern fortress, On the steep cliff whose beettling summit frowns High o'er the wave-worn shore; I watch'd the moment Of the receding surge; and thence, descending On the dry beech, escap'd. Ant. Then fly this instant; You have not here a moment's safety. Mor. Fly! No!—I came here to see Elvira—clasp her Once more in these fond arms—take from her lips A sad farewel—and then, O heav'ns! to leave her! Perhaps—heart-breaking thought!—for ever leave her! Cla. O linger not, death waits you here— Mor. Ah! never, Never will I forsake this spot, till blest With my Elvira's sight!—By all our friendship— For Love's, for Pity's sake, O lead me to her! Ant. Well, since it must be so, howe'er repugnant To Reason's sober dictates, which foresee The issue will be fatal, you shall see her. But first, let Clara, with assiduous friendship, Prepare her for your unexpected presence; Or this unhop'd for interview, perhaps, May shock too much her feelings.—I mean-while, Will guard each avenue, lest any eye Should trace you to this place. [Exeunt Clara and Antonio. Mordaunt Alone. Well! I have gain'd A moment's freedom.—How shall I employ The transient blessing?—For these holy blood-hounds Will ne'er forsake their prey.—My life's a debt I owe to heaven,—but that accursed dungeon Is worse than death.—Happy, thrice happy Britain! In thy blest plains no arbitrary mandate Restrains the sons of Freedom.—To thy shores I haste my eager flight,—but ah! those shores Joyless I seek: for I must quit Elvira. But see, Antonio comes. Enter Antonio. What hopes, my friend? Say, will Elvira bless me with her presence? Ant. Clara is now preparing her to meet you; I'll bring you to her.—Yet, my friend, remember, Danger and death surround you! Short must be Your interview; for keen Suspicion's eye Pervades this mansion. I will watch the while, —Soon as you hear my signal, fly. Mor. Ah! whither? Nor friends, nor country, claim a thought from me! Elvira's fate alone determines mine!— Her smiles my only joy—her absence death. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Enter Elvira and Clara. Elv. But may I trust your words?—are they sincere? Or does officious Friendship try to flatter My gloomy sorrows with a ray of hope? Cla. Indeed, 'tis true! And, in a few short hours— Perhaps a few short minutes, you shall see Again young Mordaunt. Elv. Oh, deceive me not! Misfortune I can bear—you know I can. But if delusive Hope should soothe my bosom With dreams of joy, only to bid me wake To deeper misery, I then may sink Beneath the cruel stroke.—If you would win My confidence in this, show me the letter— Produce the prosperous messenger, who brings These happy tidings. Cla. Then, Elvira, know He has escap'd— Elv. Escap'd!—and where's Antonio? Oh, bid him fly this instant to his aid! Where does he linger? Can he be more safe Than with his friends, than with his lov'd Elvira? But ah! perhaps, he quits this barb'rous shore Quits Lisbon's hated tow'rs, for those blest seats Where Slavery never comes.—Yes, he is gone, I read it in your looks: my cruel Mordaunt Is fled, and I shall never see him more. Well! he is safe and I am blest—and yet One parting tear he might have left—one sigh— One last farewell breath'd for his lost Elvira. Mordaunt , Entering. Antonio follows. —Go without seeing thee? my love! my life! My only hope! Elv. And do I once again Live in his arms?—then, Fortune I defy you. But are you really free?—I scarcely trust My dazzled senses, such a sudden change From deep despair to joy—but let me know The means of your escape. Mor. Suffice it now To see I have escaped—the time is precious. As through the gloom of night I pass'd along By Tagus' border, sudden from the flood, Sounds of my native language struck my ear. I hail'd the voice, and found an English bark Was anchor'd in the stream, and only waited The fav'ring gale to spread her sails for England. I to a generous seaman told my state,— My suff'rings rais'd his pity, and he promis'd To bear me hence th'ensuing eve, mean while, I must conceal myself.—But when the shades Of twilight reigns, close by the eastern port His boat awaits me. Elv. Then, alas! you fly me. For ever fly me, and the transient beam Of joy is sunk in everlasting night. Yet death attends you here—haste, haste, away— This instant fly, and yet one parting look.— Oh! Mordaunt! Mor. Perish all my hopes of safety. No, I will die in my Elvira's arms— A moment there is worth a whole eternity Of tasteless life without thee. Ant. Oh! for Love's, For Honour's sake, wake from this dream of passion Till evening comes you cannot venture forth. Think how we shall conceal you, till the hour Of flight approaches—death awaits you here. Elv. Oh, horror! horror! Cla. In the close pavilion, Deep in the orange grove, he may I think Elude discovery till the gloom of evening Shall favour his escape. Elv. Alas! my Clara! Cla. Peace, my fair friend! I must control you now. Death or perpetual bondage wait him here, He will be lost and you can hope no more. But once escap'd from Lisbon's shores, you may In happier hours and more auspicious climes Meet once again, and yet be blest together. Conduct him hence, Antonio. Mor. Yet a moment Give me, a single moment, to receive Elvira's last farewel. [Exeunt Clara and Antonio. To Elvira, after a pause— How shall I speak? These struggling sighs—these tears, alas! proclaim My tortur'd bosom.—Must we part so soon? Oh! I have tender thoughts would take an age To pour into thine ear, and we, alas! Have but a few short moments,—We must part. Elv. Part, Mordaunt, part! and can you speak that word? You—who so oft have vow'd that death itself Should ne'er divide us?—Can you calmly now Thus tell me, we must part? Mor. Oh, my Elvira! Soul of my life, my bosom's only joy! Say, do these streams of grief, this throbbing bosom Declare me calm?—Ah! witness Love and You! I wish not life, but for Elvira's sake!— Here will I stay, and perish! Elv. You mistake me: Deem not so meanly of Elvira's heart, To think she basely thus would sacrifice Her lover's safety to a foolish fondness. Yes, Mordaunt! yes! you must depart—must leave These fatal shores to tyranny devoted, For happier climes—But think not your Elvira Will linger here behind: I have resolv'd— Start not, but hear me—Did we e'er imagine In Lisbon's walls, where (Fortune set apart) Pale Superstition puts a cruel bar Between our faiths, that we could be united? No, Mordaunt!—all our fondest hopes of union On mutual flight were founded.—This misfortune Only precipitates our own design. I will fly with you. Mor. Oh, it must not be!— Shall I—who ought with more than parent care To watch o'er all your actions and consider Your good alone—with selfish passion thus Become your vile seducer? blast at once Your fame, your smiling fortune?— Elv. Hear me, Mordaunt! A moment hear me—All your faithful letters, The fond effusions of our mutual passion, Are seiz'd, and will be open to the Patriarch: The consequence must be, my close confinement; And I can never hope to see you more. Then, in your native island, you shall hear Of your Elvira's death, far from your arms; Unable to receive her parting sigh, Or pour the tear of friendship o'er her grave. Mor. Oh, cease! for Pity's sake.— Elv. And must our hopes— Our mutual vows—our promis'd happiness Melt from our grasp like empty dreams? Mor. Elvira, Your sorrows rack my soul. Elv. I feel no sorrow Like the dire thought that Mordaunt would forsake These hated shores, and fly without Elvira; Her, who so oft' he has call'd his soul's delight— The mistress of his heart! Mor. By Heav'n, you wrong me! Yes! I will own the weakness of my bosom— I did not ask my countrymen, alone To bear me off; I said, I had a friend— A female friend—companion of my flight: The seamen who attend to take me hence Will bring for you a man's disguise.—Thus far My passion urg'd; but Reason's colder hand Points out the danger of this rash attempt.— Should we be seen—should unpropitious winds Detain the bark—For me, I know the worst; And I defy it: But—my soft Elvira, What then would be thy lot?—a cloister's gloom, A parent's hatred, and a ruin'd fame! Elv. Enough of this—my firm resolve is made. Then, if you do not wish to quit me, urge No more impediments. Mor. Then be it so— To share or life or death with thee, is rapture. But say, should we be seiz'd;—must we then part? Elv. Ah, never, never!—we will die together: That union, Force nor Fraud shall ne'er refuse us;— Death shall at least unite us. In the surge, Lock'd in each others arms, we'll boldly plunge, And scorn the force that vainly strives to part us. Enter Antonio. Ant. Away; Waste not a moment: Gabriel is arriv'd. Come, Mordaunt, come; you must retire. Mor. I go:— Farewel, my love! Remember!— Elv. Oh, farewell! [Exeunt; Antonio and Mordaunt on one side, Elvira on the other. Enter Gabriel and an Officer. Gab. How came you here? Offi. You know, you bade me search For the escap'd offender. Gab. True; but hither I did not bid you come. Offi. My reverend father, I have abundant reason to believe The fugitive is in this mansion hid. I trac'd his footsteps from the castle wall To Tagus' brink: inquiring there, I found An English boat had early in the morn Been anchoring near; and that a stranger youth Had been in converse with the British seamen, And after bent his steps this way. Gab. Perhaps It may be Mordaunt.—That his ardent temper And disappointed hopes might bring him hither, Is highly probable; and yet, I think He hardly here would linger long, to meet A certain fate. But hark! I hear a step; Retire and wait my call. [Exit Officer. Enter Diego Come hither, Diego. Say, have you seen Antonio? Die. He is here. Gab. Where is his bosom friend, that English youth. Is he here too? Die. I know not. Gab. Answer truly. No hesitation.—Where is Mordaunt? Tell me? Die. Alas! I know not. Gab. No evasion, traitor: Declare the truth. Your countenance betrays Your inward guilt—I know you're an accomplice, An aider of his flight. Die. Indeed, my Lord— Gab. Enough! that will be seen—What, ho! Ramirez. Enter Officer. Seize this Apostate: bear him instant off To close confinement. Die. Spare me, holy Father! Oh, spare me! and I will discover all. Gab. Be speedy, then; I have no time to wait Your tardy words—Is Mordaunt now conceal'd Within the palace? Die. Heav'ns! must I betray him! Gab. What! hesitating still?—Away at once With this obdurate sinner. Die. Mercy! mercy! I will confess—He is conceal'd— Gab. Speak!—Where? Die. In the pavilion 'mid the orange grove West of the Palace—Gabriel whispers the officer, who goes out. Wretched, that I am! What have I done! Gab. 'Tis well! you may retire. [Exit Diego. Gabriel alone. These papers have disclos'd the latent cause Of fair Elvira's coldness to my brother. Presumptuous boy! destruction shall attend Your rash designs, and you shall cross no more My well-plann'd schemes. The weak, the gen'rous Felix, Would hesitate by arts like these to raise His tow'ring fortune.—He, good easy man, Would fain be great, yet scruples to employ The means that lead to greatness. Coward Conscience! This gown and holy cowl had better suited His timid spirit: I was form'd for action— To bustle in the world. Yet, thank my stars! This sacred habit has not altogether Fail'd my ambitious purpose. Enter Clara. Cla. Holy Father! What means yon dark attendant of the Church That lurks about? I tremble! tell me? Gab. Daughter, Pretend not ignorance; you know the cause. Cla. I own I do: But tell me, Gabriel, truly Why does your saint-like zeal so closely follow This unoffending stranger? Gab. Unoffending? Speaks Clara thus, the gentle pious Clara? Have not his deeds profan'd our Holy Church? Contemn'd her worship? Cla, Never, Gabriel, never! Whate'er his inward thoughts,—and who shall dare, Save He who form'd the heart, to regulate Its secret springs—he never would insult The faith of others. Gab. Speak not so profanely: Such reasoning suits not you. Cla. But I will speak— Will speak the truths I know:—truths that shall raise The blush of Shame—if Shame can paint the cheek Of dark Hypocrisy and mask'd Ambition. 'Tis not religious zeal that drives you on To Mordaunt's ruin. I have closely scann'd Your secret councils, and I read their source. You know the mutual passion that has fir'd Him and my hapless friend. Gab. Your hapless friend! Does Clara call herself Elvira's friend. And thus encourage her misguided passion For this unknown, this wretched youth! Cla. Are these The pious dictates of that Holy Faith Of which you boast to be the minister? Has Christian Charity instructed you To raise Oppression's arm o'er suffering Virtue, And bend the suppliant knee to Pride and Greatness. But why thus waste my words on thee, whose bosom Ne'er felt the touch of soft Humanity. I know your zeal—'Tis Felix, not Elvira Whose welfare you consult. Yet your own safety, Perhaps, may have some weight. The Patriarch comes, And with him Felix: tho' he is your brother, He has a heart; he will not hear, unmov'd, Elvira's sad complaints: Nor will Alonzo, The good Alonzo, bless the friendly hand That bends his niece to earth, or praise the insolence That fills with alguazils his sacred palace. Consider this! Gab. What, is the Patriarch coming? Say, has he left the King? Cla. He has; and Felix Attends him to his mansion. Gab. [Aside] 'Tis unlucky! Cla. I see you pause: You yet may save us all— May save yourself: attend, and hear me coolly! Instead of racks and flames, use gentler means— Let Mordaunt fly! Gab. Let Mordaunt fly!—impossible! Cla. Well, to your cooler thoughts, I leave the arbitration:—but, remember That Innocence will never plead in vain To good Alonzo; nor oppressive Violence Escape his piercing eye, or just resentment. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Gabriel alone How shall I act? howe'er I mask'd my fears To Clara's eye, her reasons have alarm'd me. Alonzo's mind is gentle, and may bend To soothe Elvira's weakness; and this youth Has gain'd a strange ascendant o'er his mind. Oft have I seen his eye with parent fondness Watch o'er his actions; while a swelling tear Stood on the lid—'Tis strange! a youth unknown— But he must be remov'd, whate'er the consequence. Good heavens! Elvira comes. Enter Elvira. Elv. Off! give me way! O Father Gabriel! Gab. Gracious Madam! tell me What means this storm of sorrow? Elv. They have seiz'd him— They bear him hence! they do—indeed they do. I see they drag him off.—O Clara! Clara! Could you not aid him, for these feeble hands Were stetch'd in vain: the barb'rous ruffians held me. Oh! Pity, Pity! Gab. Gentle Lady, calm These fervid struggles: Nothing has been done, But in pure mercy. Elv. Mercy! What! to plunge him Deep in a dungeon's gloom—to load his limbs With bolts and galling fetters! Is this mercy? Gab. These strong emotions will affect your health: Pray lead her in. Elv. Inhuman wretches, no! For I can die ev'n here. [Throwing herself on the ground. Enter Mordaunt, guarded. Elvira, rising, and running to him. You will not save him, Alas! you cannot. You have not the pow'r. This arm shall do it then, shall save my love, My injur'd Mordaunt. [Draws a dagger, is disarmed.] Mor. Ruffians, set me free. Elv. (wildly) Where am I? tell me?—Where, Oh, where is Mordaunt? Ah! who are these? Mor. My love, my life, be calm! Elv. That well-known voice Recals my wandering senses, but recals them To more exalted misery.—Do you mean To take his life this instant? Must he die Before my eyes,—die here? Gab. No! heaven forbid it! His guilt must first be prov'd. Elv. Then, worthy Gabriel, Grant me a moment's converse with him, ere You take him hence for ever.—If his errors Are all his crime, perhaps my 'suasive voice May lead him to the truth.—One moment's interview Is all I ask—What, deaf to my entreaties, Hard as the adamant!—or, do you wish To see your patron's darling at your feet? Well, be it so! behold me on the ground, A sad, a weeping suppliant!— [Kneeling. Gab. Lady, rise! Rise, I beseech you. Elv. Never, till you grant This small, this last request. Gab. I must not now. Yet, this I promise, ere he leaves the palace He shall revisit you: will that suffice? Elv. Alas, it must! Farewell, farewell my Mordaunt! We shall not long be parted. Gab. Lead her hence. [Exit Elvira. —(To Mordaunt.) Well, Sir, you have done well—this was no low, No common flight of love! Alonzo's niece, The flow'r of Portugal, was worth your care. But well I know your country's arrogance! You thought alliance with an English Soldier Would honor Lisbon's Patriarch. Mor. Insolence Like this I scorn—Yet e'en to thee, vile reptile! Thus much I will in spite of scorn reply. Elvira's merit is a prize so high As mocks the worth of princes—else, I tell you, In any other claim, a British Soldier Is equal to the proudest of the race Of this misguided country. Gab. Haughty youth! I do not wish to wrangle with thee now, But make one fair proposal. Mor. Well! I hear you. Gab. Know, I detest thee; for thy hated passion Now stands between my brother and Elvira. 'Tis in my power to crush thee to the dust, To tread thee into nothing. Mor. This from thee, Thou gowned ruffian!—Give me patience, Heav'n! It is too much! Gab. Restrain thy rage, and mark me. This instant quit this mansion.—I will see thee Safely conducted to thy country's vessel. Forsake this hostile shore,—depart, and live. Mor. What, leave Elvira thus—Is this your promise? This the fond interview your voice allow'd us? No, I will die a thousand deaths, ere thus Forego our last sad meeting. Gab. Then you will not Accept my proffer'd safety? Mor. No, proud churchman! Here will I still remain: Nor dare you violate, By impious force, this place. Gab. That will be seen.— [To the Officer.] This instant, bear him off. Mor. Ruffians, unhand me!— Curse on these servile bands!—O torture! torture! [He is forced off. Gab. Imperious head-strong boy!—but chains and fasting Shall bend his stubborn spirit. Let me now Examine this, which from his bosom dropp'd Amid the struggle.— [Opens a pocket-book, and reads. Gracious Heaven defend me! What do I see?—To Don Alonzo, Bishop Of Salvador in the Brasils. What means this? The foolish boy is surely ignorant That this Alonzo is the potent Patriarch Who now presides o'er Lisbon; else he never Had suffer'd letters of such high import To lie unheeded by—Now, by my order, I am amaz'd—Here is within this packet Something inclos'd—I must examine it. Ramirez.—! Enter Officer. Off. Sir! Gab. Attend to what I order. Be sure your prisoner does not see the Patriarch, Or send ought to him; keep him close confin'd: Do this, as you regard my future favor. [Exit Officer. Now seals give way: but hark! some one approaches. [Puts up the Papers. Enter Felix. Gab. Felix! so soon return'd! Where is the Patrarch? Fel. He is arriv'd—and has with mark'd displeasure Heard the complaint of Clara. Gab. With displeasure? Has he then disapprov'd my pious zeal? Fel. Could he approve your violence? to seize This stranger here beneath his roof? Even I, All partial to you as I am, condemn it. Why do you, with such unrelenting rigour, Thus persecute this youth? Gab. His daring heresy Obnoxious to our faith— Fel. Oh! brother, brother! This pious motive will not pass with me. Besides, the Patriarch (whose religious zeal Burns with a flame at least as strong as yours) Deem'd not the youth so guilty. I will use My warmest interest in this stranger's cause. His manly conduct and ingenuous manner Have won my good opinion. Gab. Oh! beware Of such misjudging candour. Know this Mordaunt, This mild ingenuous stripling, is your rival— Is your successful rival. Fel. 'Tis impossible. Gab. 'Tis true. See here—Within my hands, I hold The proofs—the damning proofs. Feb. Shew me those proofs? Let me convince myself. Gab. That must not be. They were seiz'd on him by the vigilance Of our Most Sacred Office, and beneath That holy seal are clos'd. The Patriarch first Himself alone must break it: then his justice Will give you ample vegeance. Fel. From his power I ask no vengeance—If the treach'rous youth Has dar'd invade my future happiness, Even in the tenderest point, Elvira's love,— This arm shall do me justice. I nor want Your subtle arts to right me, nor the rigour, The feeble rigour of a churchman's mandate. Give me the papers. [Snatching at them. Gab. No, the tale of perfidy Would but enflame your rage—How would you bear To find that Mordaunt, a poor wandering outcast, Had in a few short days, with artful wiles, Blasted your hopes on years of service founded— Won that obdurate heart, which all your cares, Your fond assiduous tenderness, so long Had woo'd, but woo'd in vain? One only step Can make Elvira yours—the death of Mordaunt. Fel: Perfidious maid! was he the hated cause Of all your coldness, when you sighing turn'd Reluctant from the nuptial vow? On heav'n And holy solitude fixing your choice,— Was Mordaunt all that heaven? Enter a Servant. Ser. My Lord, the Patriarch. Gab. Now brother, mark me once again: Your hopes Of fair Elvira's hand, her future welfare— Dearer than all—depend on Mordaunt's ruin. Remember this, and cross not my designs. Enter the Patriarch. Pat. How comes it, Gabriel, that my house is thus Become the seat of uproar? Wherefore glare The ministers of justice 'neath this roof, The seat of peace and sanctity? From Clara I have a story heard that wounds my bosom: Are you inform'd of it? Gab. My honour'd Lord, I knew nought of the business, till these letters, Found on the English youth, reveal'd it. Pat. Then, Equivocation set apart, you knew it: And I must tell you, that I disapprove, Most strongly disapprove, your daring conduct. What? when the honour of my house—the name Of my Elvira—thus was brought in question, To blazon forth the business to the world With studied industry—does this become The man, who styles himself my friend?—what could My bitterest foe do more? Gab. Your orders were Never to make distinctions, when Religion And Justice were annex'd. Pat. And so, you chose To change a general maxim to an order Strictly to be observ'd in every case; Regardless of pecular circumstance; And turn the Sword of Justice and of Mercy Against your Patron's bosom. Yet, perhaps, You might, without offence to rigid Justice, By being partial to a friend, at least, Have deign'd to tell me first of your intent, —Consulted my opinion. Gab. Holy Father! So much I fear'd to shock you with the tale, That— Pat. Well, no more! but, henceforth, learn The Sword of Justice never shews so bright As when the cherub Mercy blunts its edge; And, when Religion draws it, cruel Rigour Wears a redoubled horror. But, of this, More in a fitter season—I at present Would see your prisoner. Gab. He shall instantly Await your pleasure. Pat. In the hall of audience Attend with him: there will I hear the whole Of that unhappy story. [Exit Gabriel. After a pause] Now, Don Felix, We may lament the ruin of our hopes, The transient fabrick Love and Friendship plann'd. How has the pleasing vision sooth'd my soul, To think my bosom friend would soon become My nearest kinsman: But, alas! 'tis o'er— For ever lost! This painful dignity— Which Heaven can tell I never sought—has planted Thorns in my fairest paths! Yet well I hop'd To pass my latest hours in placid calmness.— You know, my friend, the story of my life: You know how Riches, Honour, Power, have flow'd With lavish current on me;—Well you know, Unask'd by me, my Royal Master gave me His warmest confidence. But ah! the joys That sweeten public cares, are now denied me! Return'd this moment from my Sovereign's presence, Loaded with higher honours,—and their consequence Severer duties—I a moment snatch'd To breathe the quiet of domestic leisure With thee, my friend, and my belov'd Elvira:— And what a storm has met me!—Poor Elvira! Too well, alas! this heart can sympathise With thy distress!—for I alas! have known The cruel pangs of disappointed love: Nor do I feel unhurt the deep despair That waits the unhappy Mordaunt! Fel. Name him not! He nor deserves your friendship nor your pity: For, as my brother tells me— Pat. Ah, Don Felix! Trust not to Gabriel's words.—It grieves me much To wound a brother's feelings;—but his actions Are mark'd by strong suspicion, and disgrace Even now hangs o'er his head. Mordaunt, 'tis true, Has been imprudent, and my peace has suffer'd From his misguided passion; yet I own I feel a sympathetic power that binds me, I know not how, to love him! Then, his country— Where her I loved!—his features, too, so strongly Resemble that dear image fix'd for ever Within this bosom! that, did time or circumstance Warrant the thought, I should suppose him link'd By blood to her! Fel. What, with Matilda?—her, Your long-lost English mistress! Pat. O my friend! You know the painful secret of my sorrows; You know, too well, the Courtier, Statesman, Prelate, Ne'er from his breast could drive the fond remembrance Of happier joys long past; Elvira's passion Recals those soft ideas:—Clara tells me Love has so strongly seiz'd her ardent bosom, (Once fix'd, I thought, on Heaven; but which I try'd To turn to you) that much I fear its force Will, if resisted, urge some dire resolve. Ah, would I could indulge it!—but, alas! That cannot be! bars not to be o'erpass'd Forbid the thought. My poor, my lov'd Elvira! You were my fondest hope! the only relic Sav'd from the wreck of all my soul was fix'd on! Joy after joy is, by relentless Fate, Torn from my tortur'd bosom; and I stand Alone, unshelter'd, 'mid a storm of sorrow! Fel. My Lord, the subject bears too hard upon you; Try to direct your mind to other cares. Pat. 'Tis all in vain! Ambition's glaring form, That meteor which the busy world pursues With unremitting zeal, has now, alas! No charms for me! The deep tho' silent memory Of human Nature's dearest, best affections— Never, ah! never to be hop'd again!— Preys on my bosom with a vulture's beak. And, while the inward torture gnaws my vitals, How can the trappings of superfluous Greatness Claim ev'n a thought—Oh, Felix, I am wretched! [Exeunt. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Gabriel, Mordaunt, and Officers. Mordaunt. Why am I hither brought, a wretched pageant For crouds to gaze on? Is it not enough To persecute the wretched, that you thus Add insult to misfortune? Gab. I insult you? Tis not my orders bring you here; I well Could spare you further trouble, and at once Consign you to oblivion: But the Patriarch Demands to see you; Lo! he comes; to him Make your complaints, not me. Enter Patriarch. Pat. (Seeing Mordaunt) Gabriel, how's this? In chains! Why such excess of rigour? Gab. Sir, You know the Holy Office always treats A fugitive with strict severity: I but obey its canons. Pat. (To Mordaunt.) Sir, you see, That flight and opposition have but added To your misfortunes. That I was your friend, You know; nor has this rashness quite estrang'd My friendship from you: This be then the proof; —Give me the sanction of your solemn promise To render up your person, when demanded, To answer your accusers; and till then Not to quit Portugal; and you are free. Mor. Rever'd Alonzo, I pledge my promise, but— Pat. Why hesitate? Mor. Forgive me, Sir! the presence of that man Arrests my utterance. [Pointing to Gabriel. Pat. (To the Officers) What, in fetters still! This instant free him. [They loose Mordaunt. Mor. Oh, this goodness kills me! Alas! too well I feel I do not merit Such kindness from your hands. Pat. Retire, and leave us For a few moments.— [All go out except the Patriarch and Mordaunt. To Mordaunt, after a pause.] Tell me, rash young man, What wayward destiny first led you hither To your own ruin, and to bring destruction On this unhappy house? Say, what advantage Could your most sanguine wishes hope, from gaining The fond affections of a hapless maid, Who never can be yours?— [Aside] His look unman's me!— His mein, his eyes are hers! Mysterious Heaven— How can this be!—O Mordaunt, I esteem'd you; I thought mild Candour and ingenuous Truth Reign'd in your bosom: how have you deceiv'd me —Alas, I feel it here!—Yet, trust me, youth, The time will come, when you will vainly wish You had restrain'd this impulse of the soul. —I speak as one by sad experience taught The dire effects of unresisted passion; I as a father speak.— [Weeps. Mor. My honor'd Lord, Were I permitted— Pat. I have heard it all— Know all you have to say. The gentle Clara, Warm in your cause, has painted your imprudence With every softening shade that partial friendship Could blend with it. I do you ample justice: I think your passion free from selfish interest, Founded on love alone—but what of that? Elvira can't be yours, you know she cannot. Rouse then your slumbering virtue, quit this country. —Your promise to remain I here give back; My friendship shall attend you, shall protect you Where'er you go. Mor. Oh, good Alonzo, spare me! The effort is too great. Pat. Nought is too great For duty and for virtue to accomplish, In him who knows the sacred claims of both. Mark the example of a woman's firmness.— I know a man, he was my nearest friend, Who form'd a union of the closest kind With a lov'd maid—one of your country too: Yet, when the gen'rous fair-one found their nuptials, If e'er divulg'd, would blast his future prospects; Not her own love—not even his happiness Weigh'd in her bosom—leaving friends and him To splendid misery and torturing greatness, She ne'er was heard of more.—Oh, gen'rous Mordaunt! Follow this great example, and restore us That peace you have destroy'd. Mor. Oh, 'tis too much— Give me again into the harpy fangs Of stern Oppression—they can only take My worthless life: your goodness is more cruel; You bid me live, live far from my Elvira. Mistake me not;—I have no hopes: I know You never can unite us,—and your friendship Bars all clandestine enterprise. In pity Seek not to save me from the stroke of death,— The only remedy for woes like mine. Oh, most benevolent of men! your mercy Only prolongs my torture. Pat. Hapless youth, You give me heartfelt anguish! your distress Recals the fatal hour!—Ah, Mordaunt, Mordaunt Lift up your hopes, beyond this troubled scene Of woe and misery, to those blest climes Where only real happiness is found. What are, alas! the fairest hours of man, But transient gleams of comfort, soon obscur'd By deep'ning clouds of sorrow? Mor. Am I then, Cut off from every hope? Why died I not, Ere yet my sense could feel the strokes of fortune, With my unhappy parents. Pat. With your parents! Mor. My father died ere my remembrance mark'd him, And to my mother's life my birth was fatal. Her sister foster'd me, and I was bred To every fair acquirement:—at her death, (For she my last my only friend is gone) I was, by her bequest, to shape my way To Lisbon; hence to sail for the Brasils: What stop'd my course you know. Pat. Strange destination! To the Brasils! Would I had met you there. Mor. Have you, my Lord, been there? Pat. Yes, many years I exercis'd a holy function.— Gabriel enters hastily, followed by Felix. Gab. Sir, One word I beg. [Takes the Patriarch aside. Mor. The Patriarch's strangely mov'd— O spare his gen'rous bosom, Gracious Heav'n! Double my woes, so he be freed from sorrow. This meddling priest torments him. Pat. [Shewing a letter to Mordaunt. Do you know This paper, Sir? Mor. I do. Pat. And were you, then, As this your countryman's dispatch imports, To fly the coast of Portugal, and bear A woman with you? Mor. Yes. Pat. That woman was— Mor. Elvira!—I am wretched, but I scorn To veil the truth. Pat. Your pardon, Father Gabriel! Your zeal was well directed. To Mordaunt.] Sir, you promis'd, Promis'd me, even now, you would not quit These shores unknown to me. I see your artifice— Just Heav'n! that such a treach'rous heart should lurk Beneath so fair an outside!—But I leave you Now to your fate—I leave you to the laws You have insulted.—Officers approach, Secure your prisoner, and, at dawn of day, Bear him to Lisbon. [The Officers surround Mordaunt. Mor. I shall not resist. [Exeunt all, except Mordaunt and Officers. Now all is lost!—my only hope has left me; And even my fame will suffer—none to clear me From this imputed treachery!—O Heav'ns! Defend me from this interview—Elvira, My lost Elvira, comes. Enter Elvira, Clara, and Felix. Elv. And is he free— Loos'd from his galling chains by good Alonzo? [Sees Mordaunt surrounded by Officers.] Ah, dreadful sight!—a prisoner still!—O Clara! Say, was this well, to soothe me thus with hope Only to wound me more?—And then, the Patriarch (He, whose relenting soul I thought all goodness) Is merciless as Gabriel?—Be it so; My bosom, too, is steel'd; and I defy The threats of further torture. Offi. Sir, You heard The Patriarch's order; you must quit this place. Mor. Now, my best love, be firm; summon your spirits; For we, alas! must part.—Oh, noble Felix! Foes, rivals as we are—for Honour's sake, By all you hold most sacred, I conjure you, Inform the Patriarch (in whose eyes I now Seem an ungrateful traitor) that the plan Of flying with Elvira was concerted Before I pledg'd my solemn faith to him. Tell him, that, with religious sanctity, I would have kept that faith: Tell him, my life My happiness are lost—but not my honour. Fel. I swear to do you justice. Mor. 'Tis enough! I ask no other favour. But Elvira, My lov'd, my lost Elvira— Elv. Yet one word, One parting word. Fel. My bosom bleeds to see you! Could but my pity aid you, I were blest. Elv. You pity me?—I thank you: Every wretch Meets generous pity: But what friendly hand Will succour misery? Fel. You wrong me, Madam— Heaven knows you do; and could I think this youth Deserves the tears you shed— Cla. Then hear me, Felix: My judgment is not warp'd by fond affection To justify this youth. How can you doubt him? That sympathetic unison, which draws True Honor to its likeness, should ere now Have shown you foul Dishonour never masks Her loathsome form beneath th'ingenuous brow That honest Candour lights. Fel. I do believe you; I will this moment hasten to Alonzo, And set his error right. Elv. It is too late— My uncle will not now believe the tale. I know he will not. In one thing alone You can assist us now. Fel. Oh, name it to me, And you shall see my zeal to serve your wishes. Elv. Obtain for me a single interview With Mordaunt, ere he leaves this place for Lisbon— An interview, unwatch'd by prying eyes Of keen Suspicion: I have much to say. Gain me but this, and I shall ever feel The warmest gratitude.— Fel. 'Tis a hard task—but you shall be obey'd. [To the Officers, who urge Mordaunt to go. Suspend your haste: I'll answer this delay.— Madam, my word is sacred:—tho' I see Nought but accumulated grief await This interview, my interest shall be urg'd To its extent to gain it. Do you wish This instant to obtain it? Elv. (After a pause) No;—I ask A little time to recollect my firmness.— 'Tis not before the morning's dawn, that Mordaunt Departs for Lisbon; let me, then, this night See him alone in the arcade that leads To the pavilion: there the guards may wait To watch their prisoner. Mor. Shall I be permitted Once more to hold free converse with you—breathe Again my vows of everlasting love? Yet; my Elvira, let me speak one word, One single word, even now. Apart to Elvira] Remember that We had resolv'd to live or die together. That now depends on you—then be provided With means to set us free. Elv. Enough—'tis done— Behold this phial! Mor. Dread alternative! My bosom thrills with horror!—Must you die? To Felix.] I know you, Sir—know I can trust your honour: I would repay your kindness; but, alas! I'm poor in all, but gratitude.—Farewell, Farewell, my lov'd Elvira! [Throws himself among the officers, and is led off. Elv. Is he gone? [Sinks into a chair. Cla. Alas, she faints!—O Felix, if a spark Of that fond passion, which you once have felt For my unhappy friend rest in your bosom, Fulfil her wishes, let her see again The wretched Mordaunt; now a disappointment Would drive her to despair. Elv. (Trying to kneel, which Felix prevents)— Oh, hear me! hear me! Deny me not the only consolation That this distracted heart can know,—He's gone, Without one fond adieu!—Think what it is To quit one's bosom's only hope, deny'd To breathe one parting sigh! Fel. Oh, doubt me not! My solemn promise never can be broken. At hazard of my life—at hazard even Of, what is dearer far, Alonzo's friendship— I will obtain this interview. Be calm; I may be more successful even than this: At least, be certain of my warmest zeal To do you every service.—Tho' my love Is disappointed, I will be your friend:— Wretched I cannot be, if you are happy. [Exeunt. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Enter Gabriel and Don Felix. Gab. This sudden call to Lisbon is unlucky; It thwarts my best designs. Some trusty person, To watch the good old Patriarch in my absence Would lull my fears to silence.—You, Don Felix, His ancient friend, who share his warmest confidence, By interest and by blood are doubly bound To do this office,—but the buoyant down Is steadier than your breast:—a tear, a sigh, A mournful tale, unmans you in a moment: And this delusive mummery of mercy, This wish to save a wretched hypocrite, Our bitterest foe, o'erturns each brilliant prospect That Interest and Ambition can display. Even your ador'd Elvira.— Fel. That is o'er. I have, in Reason's balance, fully weigh'd My hopeless love. Our different age and temper; Her passion for this stranger youth; convince me I cannot, with the shadow of success, Pursue her favour. Gab. Vain and childish weakness? But, mark my words.—Keep, for a time, Alonzo In this his present mood—The next fair wind Wafts this obscure adventurer to Brasil: There, let him, in the bowels of a mine, Form airy visions of Elvira's love, And share the Patriarch's wealth, Fel. Inhuman Gabriel! Will nothing but his wretchedness suffice; How has this youth offended you? Gab. In nothing. Your interest I consult. His life or death To me are equal—I regard him not. But, if he is not speedily remov'd, And so remov'd as never to return, As certain as to-morrow's sun shall rise, Elvira will be his:—not by contrivance, Or secret flight, but from the Patriarch's hand. Fel. Brother, you surely rave! Gab. Convince yourself, Behold this portrait! Fel. 'Tis Alonzo's, drawn As it should seem in youth: But what of this? Gab. O'erlook this superscription—“To Alonzo, Bishop of Salvador”—The Patriarch's picture Was in this letter. Fel. What were its contents? Gab. Prudence perhaps would bid me keep them secret, Did I not hope Elvira's certain loss May rouse you into action.—Briefly thus: You know Alonzo, in his prime of life, Was sent to England, when the embassy Of Pedro went. Fel. I know it well: proceed. Gab. There a fair English woman's fatal charms Ensnar'd his bosom: Soon his ardent suit Won her affection; and a private marriage Indulg'd their passion. After this event, Alonzo was recall'd. His family, Finding the Church a fairer prospect open'd To his advancement, made him quit the Army To fill a sacred function. Fel. From Alonzo, All this, in confidence, I've learn'd before. I know, too, that the British heroine scorn'd To hurt his future fortunes, and resolv'd To hide their marriage. When at length she found Alonzo deaf even to the hint of parting, Sudden she disappear'd, and her retirement Baffled his fruitless search. I further know Nought could induce him to receive the order Of Holy Priesthood, till undoubted proof Shew'd him his wife had with her burthen perish'd In an unlucky labour. Gab. But you knew not That proof was forg'd—that she produc'd a son, A living son.—In her retirement rear'd him, As from a sister sprung,—and that his son Is Mordaunt. Fel. Mordaunt? Do I hear you right? Just heav'n! can this be true? Gab. Too sure it is. Fel. Oh, strange event! But where's th'heroic mother? Gab. Th'heroic mother, as you call her, liv'd To rear this youth; nor was each bright attainment, That travel or that study could bestow, Spar'd in his nurture—for she was not poor. Dying, while he was absent, she bequeath'd This packet to his care; with strict injunction To give it to Alonzo, whom her search Had only trac'd to the Brasils. The titles By royal favour in succession gain'd Of Prelate, Patriarch, Cardinal, conceal'd The powerful statesman from his vagrant offspring— Conceal'd I hope for ever. Fel. Source of Mercy! Can such remorseless malice swell the bosom Of one, who boasts to be thy minister? I, train'd to war and blood, shrink at the thought Would you conceal this secret from the Patriarch Withhold the letter and the faithful portrait— Withhold his only son?— Gab. Surely I will! 'Twere madness else.—Do you not see the triumph, The instant triumph of our hated foe Waits the discovery? Fel, Of our hated foe? Yours he may be, for you have injur'd him. But know, Alonzo's son is Felix' friend. Enter a Servant hastily. Ser. My Lord, the carriage waits to bear you hence. The Patriarch too has sent again, to urge Your quick departure. Gab. Is his eminence Now in his chamber? Ser. Yes, but he enjoin'd us Not to disturb him there:—He is retir'd To private meditation. [Exit. Gab. I must go. You will not sure, from foolish qualms of conscience, Betray what I've reveal'd? Fel. I never yet Have injur'd you, and you must trust me now. Gab. You cannot mean to tell the Patriarch, Felix— Assure me that you will not. [Servant enters. Well, I come. Goes to the door, returns.] Besides, perhaps the tale may not be true; No one can prove it while I keep these papers. Think well on this.—What has my folly done! [Exit with the Servant. Felix alone. What must I do? What Gabrierl has disclos'd Is surely true. He only from that paper Could have obtain'd the secret of the marriage To me entrusted:—How shall I determine? Why hesitate!—The sacred call of Honor And Friendship's holy voice must be obey'd. Tis true I serve a rival,—but away Each selfish thought; Elvira slights my love, But spite of scorn I will deserve her friendship. [Exit. Elvira alone. Let me not think—there is no room for doubt: Why should I longer bear this weight of wo, When death can free me? What is wretched life, When ev'ry hope is fled?—I can remember, When earth and nature smil'd—when ev'ry object Teem'd with delight, and each revolving hour Brought new enjoyment.—But that scene is vanish'd, And gloomy horror sits with sable wings Brooding o'er all creation.—Let me go To happier realms, where never yet despair Or anguish came. This precious medicine Shall free me from the pangs of separation,— From quitting all I love. The time approaches Of our last interview—and must I leave My Clara—leave her without one fond word. How will she bear my loss?—Alonzo too, 'Till now so kind, so gentle—how will he Support the cruel shock? Oh! I am doom'd A curse to all my friends, to all my kindred! Let me not think, lest my disorder'd senses Forsake their troubled seat—Oh, where is Mordaunt? Mordaunt , Entering. Behold him here—Yes, once again I clasp you To my enraptur'd heart—alas! how soon To quit these arms, for ever! Elv. Say, oh! say, Is there no hope? Mor. Oh, there is none, Elvira! None, but to die together—dreadful thought! We must be quick—the harpies that surround us Give but a moment's respite:—They will soon Return to seize their prey. Oh! let me grasp That precious cordial. [Catching at the phial. Elv. 'Tis, indeed, a cordial.— One that will speedily and surely spread The peace of death through all the slumb'ring senses. But ah, my Mordaunt!—think, what yet may follow This fatal deed, should we ne'er meet again.— Or meet to be more wretched!—But it cannot— That cannot be. Mor. Oh, hear me, I conjure thee! Hear me, thou injur'd excellence!—Forego This fatal resolution!—Let me go Alone to Death; a few short years will still Unite us both. Elv. No, Mordaunt, no! To live, When you are gone, is misery beyond All that imagination can conceive. Behold another phial—my deliverance! [Mordaunt is going to drink. Yet, hold a moment.— Mor. Speak!—I only live To hear thy voice. Elv. Why should you throw away The future hopes of life? Survive, and cherish Your lost Elvira's memory. Yet, to part— For ever part!—The struggle is too great! Mor. Then, thus I end it. [Drinks the poison. Elv. Ah! stay your frantic hand. Too cruel haste! Mor. 'Tis o'er, I die your own: Let us not part in death. Oh! let me breathe My short remains of life, here in your presence. Enter Felix hastily. Fel. Forgive me this intrusion, but I trust The cause will plead my pardon. Sir, to you Freedom I bring and happiness: A secret Of great and dear importance to the Patriarch Has reach'd his ears. How much I sympathise In this event, heav'n knows. Mor. Most worthy Felix, One only favor have I now to ask— For a few moments—for a few short moments, Leave me with my Elvira. More than this You cannot grant—nor I receive. Fel. Suppose I come to say, Elvira may be yours On certain terms? Mor. Oh, she is mine already— Beyond the reach of fate! Elv. Soothe not our sorrows With flattering dreams: Our destiny disclaims Such bright illusions—You are come too late To save us now. Fel. Good heav'ns! Say,—What has happen'd? Mor. Nothing that's wonderful. The Patriarch's arm Had pow'r to crush me—He has us'd that pow'r. Fel. You little know his real character. Mor. He who feels what is right, and has not firmness To execute his feelings, injures more Than the oppressive tyrant; for to him The wretched fly for succour: where, instead Of free protection, they are render'd up To persecuting foes.—He is a prince Powerful and great; myself a wretched wand'rer! Yet Heav'n, that made us men, gave each a claim, An equal claim to justice. Fel. You are dearer To good Alonzo, than you can imagine. Mor. It may be so! but that avails me nothing. If you have mercy, Felix, but indulge My last request, and leave us. Fel. Will you not Go, and embrace the Patriarch; who expects you With all a father's love? Mor. A father's love? Fel. You know not half the happiness that waits you. Mor. Ah! happiness for me?—Not in this world. Fel. Then hear the truth, and wonder:—Know the Patriarch, Alonzo, is your father:—Fair Louisa, You deem'd your aunt, had yet a nearer claim; She was Alonzo's wife—She was your mother!— Of this the proofs are clear. Mor. Peace, cruel pangs That rend my bosom. [Falls. Elv. O heart-breaking thought!— So near our happiness—near every wish Our bosoms fram'd—Nature can bear no more! And thus I end my woes. Mor. Stay my, Elvira! I charge you, stay!—Live! live!—As I alone, With haste ungovernable, thus have pull'd This ruin on us, I alone should suffer. She hears me not.—Elvira?—hold her Felix! Elv. (drinking) 'Tis past! now, Mordaunt, I am yours for ever! No power can part us now. Fel. Alas Elvira! What has your rashness done? Elv. I've swallow'd poison. Fel. Oh, fatal error! haste, there, bring assistance. Elv. All aid, I fear, is vain: the potent draught Will baffle every art. Yet, you may try To counteract its force: I do not wish To die, if Mordaunt too can live to bless me. Enter Clara and Antonio. Cla. Oh, my Elvira! I have joyful tidings:— Why turn away? What mean these looks of death? Oh, my prophetic fears! I shrink with horror. Mor. Behold her murderer!—My cruel passion Has dragg'd her down to death!—O dying saint! Forgive me—but forgive me! Elv. Ah, forgive you? O witness, Heaven! I do not bear a thought That is not full of purest love and tenderness: Nor would I change my present fatal state For all the joys of Heav'n and Earth without you. Ant. My friend, my injur'd Mordaunt, did you come To Lisbon's walls only to find your death? Mor. No! I have found a father—so they tell me. Say, is it true? Ant. It is, it is: a moment Will clear it all. Mor. Alas! to me, that moment Will never come. Cla. Bless me, how pale she looks! Elv. A leaden torpor creeps thro' all my frame; And shades of horror swim before my eyes:— Is this th'approach of death? Mor. Oh, my Elvira! Seal but my pardon with your dying lips! How is my bosom rack'd! soon shall I hear The soothing accents of a parent's voice. Hear for a moment only! Death's cold hand Hastens to shut each avenue of sense. My sweet Elvira!—How she grasps my hand— Look up, my dying angel.—Will you not Give me one parting look? Elv. Oh, all on earth My bosom mourns to leave! And yet, alas! I rob you of a father. O my love! Sure we shall meet again. Give me your hand. I die! I die!—ah! mercy! mercy, Heaven! [Dies. Mor. Her tender frame has sunk beneath the poison! Why do my stronger nerves resist, and keep me Still on the rack of life? Enter the Patriarch. Pat. My son, my daughter, Do ye yet live? Mor. And am I, then, your son? Pat. You are, you are—Is there no aid? no means To save his life? Mor. Look on that martyr'd excellence, And ask if I can live? Pat. My poor Elvira! And Oh, my dying—oh, my murder'd son! 'Twas my remorseless vengeance kill'd ye both! Alas! ye died by me.—Ill-fated children Of an unnatural parent. Curse me, curse me;— Even with your latest breath! Mor. O bless him, Heaven! And soothe his tortur'd breast with smiles of mercy O my Elvira!—bend me towards her—so— One last embrace!—'Tis o'er, and I am gone! [Dies. Pat. My son, my injur'd son!—Mysterious Heaven! I bow beneath thy chastening hand! Don Felix, I grieve to wound your bosom; but, your brother— The cruel cause of this unhappy scene— Is now involv'd in deep disgrace, for deeds Of dire import. Why do I speak of Gabriel— My hasty rage, my blind credulity Gave edge to his keen malice—Wise too late, The anguish of Despair preys on my bosom:— I feel its force—but feel it cannot last.
