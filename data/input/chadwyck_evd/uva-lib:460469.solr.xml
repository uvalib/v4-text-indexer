      <field name="fulltext">MARY STUART: An Historical Tragedy,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO W. C. MACREADY, Esq.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. When I first turned my attention to the subject of Rizzio's death, as the ground work of a Tragedy, I was chiefly attracted by the fierce grandeur of Ruthven's character. It appeared to me, that the picture, which historians had drawn of that remarkable personage, was well calculated for poetical, and even for dramatic effect. Accordingly, I embarked my humble powers, with more ardour than consideration, in the attempt to construct a Play out of the existing materials, little thinking, at the time, what difficulties my imagination had concealed from my judgment. It was not, until I had proceeded too far to retract, (for no man likes to throw away his labour,) that I discovered how much the scantiness of the materials, the nature of the subject, and even the tone of the characters, were calculated to obstruct my design. Ruthven was too savage, and Rizzio too despicable, to be faithfully represented on the stage; and Mary's attachment to her favourite could not be rendered prominent, without the greatest danger, nor evaded, without suppressing the only circumstance, that could palliate, or indeed account for the sanguinary act. I do not presume to say, that I have surmounted these difficulties,âthat I have produced scenes which, without countenancing the imputation of actual guilt, are still sufficiently marked by indiscretion, to soften the otherwise unmitigated horror of the catastrophe: but it was my intention to have done so; and I have stated the disadvantages peculiar to the subject itself, as an apology for those defects with which the Drama may be otherwise fairly chargeable. To the Ladies and Gentlemen, whose talents in the performance of the different characters have contributed so much to the success of âMary Stuartâ on the stage, and to every one concerned in its preparation, I beg to offer my most cordial thanks for their zealous and able assistance.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Court Yard before Morton's House. Enter Morton, followed by Lindsay. MORTON. So! Maitland not yet come? no letter! no Dispatch! not even a message! LINDSAY. None, my Lord, But what I've told you. MORTON. That was nothing! nothing! Forgive me, Lindsay; but my mind's so harass'd I cannot speak in measured-courtesy: To think that he should loiter at a time Like this, when Scotland's fate is in the balance! Nay, let me hear again what 'twas he said, If he said ought. LINDSAY. The words would signify That pressing business called him for awhile Another way; but I should scarce have time To tell you so, when he'd be here himselfâ And look!â Enter Maitland. MORTON. 'Tis he! Well, Maitland! what success? What tidings from the West? MAITLAND. Throughout the track I've measured in my journey, discontent Was every whereâthe storm-cloud fills the sky:â From every pulpit loud anathemas Are thundered at the Queen:âher enmity To the true worship shakes the crown upon Her head: nor is her love of foreigners Forgotten, nor her deadly hatred of The banished Lords: in short, some dire explosion Is ripening fast; we must direct it, or Be swept away by 't. MORTON. Well; and what have you Done for our cause? MAITLAND. What every honest man Would wish to see were done. I urged the People To send in strong petitions for the pardon Of Murray. MORTON. That was well: 'tis the sole hope Of Scotland now. His pardon and return Would still controul the headlong course of ruin The Queen seems bent on. Did they promise you? MAITLAND. Allâto a man: there's noble stuff amongst 'em. Before yon sun shall dive into the West I'll have some score of grave remonstrances To back our efforts for his quick recall. But how have matters prospered in my absence With you at home? MORTON. E'en as you left 'emâbadly. The King is still estranged from us; the Queen As much as ever in the hands of Rizzio. French counsels are the fashion, and we hear Nothing of England but abuse. The Pope, In spite of all John Knox's rhetoric, Builds up his Church anew, and sees it prosper, While murmurs, half suppressed, tell of the ire That's bursting for an outbreak. MAITLAND. Then, the more Our need of Murray's presence: let us strive For its accomplishment: his influence, As brother to the Queen, combining with His other qualities, gives him great power. LINDSAY. Look, my good Lord, A scion of your noble house approaches. MORTON. An offshoot from the stem. Young George was born Of some fair sinner to a Douglas, who Besought and won us to acknowledge him. But here he is. Well, George! Enter George Douglas. DOUGLAS. Not well, my Lord, If I may judge. Ha! noble Maitland, welcome To Edinburgh once more. MAITLAND. Thanks, gallant friend. But how is this? you spoke complainingly As you came inâI know you're not a croaker: What is the latest news? DOUGLAS. A pageant, Sir:â I stopped upon the way to see it move; And who, d'ye think, led on the bright array, Shining like stars before it? MAITLAND. Why, the King And Queen, of course. DOUGLAS. There was another still:â Guess who that other was. MAITLAND. Not Bothwell? DOUGLAS. No. MORTON. Nor Lenox? DOUGLAS. Nor yet Lenox. MAITLAND. Was it Sir James? I mean the Queen's adviser, prudent Melville? DOUGLAS. You cannot, or you will not, look so low As truth must drag you. What would'st say if Rizzio Made up the third?âKing, Queen, and David Rizzio!! MAITLAND. Impossible! DOUGLAS. Not to those eyes that saw him. MORTON. And how did Rizzio seem to bear his state? DOUGLAS. Like one who had a ponderous weight to carryâ His own importance: and i' faith he carried it With a high head. The King spoke little to him, But the Queen smiled, and that was all he cared for. MORTON. 'Tis through his artifice that Rome prevailsâ Through him that bigot's plot, the Bayonne league, Which binds 'em to extirpate Protestants, Finds favour with the Queen!âall his contrivance. MAITLAND. Well, let's succeed in bringing Murray back. DOUGLAS. Would we could put your project to the proof! But that's impossible:âthe only man Whose boldness might accomplish such an end Is dying. MORTON. Ha! you speak of Ruthven?âWhat! Is heâ DOUGLAS. There's not an hour of breath in his lungs. MORTON. Your evidence? What is your evidence? He's of the Titan breed, in mind and body: A mountain of the North. DOUGLAS. Mountains have fallen; And rocks have sunk; and Ruthven's race is runâ I left his chamber but an hour ago;â He looked a corpse. MORTON. How could you waste the time In talking of a foolish pageant, when You had a fact like this to tell? DOUGLAS. Because My hate of Rizzio, and my scorn of folly, Were greater than my fear. MORTON. You think too much Of your own wrongs;âall's lost, if Ruthven's lost. DOUGLAS. Well, here comes Chalmers; he was with him too; Consult this judgment, as you question mine. Enter Chalmers. MORTON. You come from Ruthven, Chalmers; is it life, Or death, with him? CHALMERS. While there's a spark of life, I'll not despair;âbesides, he mends. MORTON. Hear that From an old soldier: One who has seen death Do many a hard day's work! DOUGLAS. And so have I Seen death, without the sexton at his heels, In many a battle:âthough my years are few, They fell on a good fighting time, thank fortune! MORTON. Still you must grant us Chalmers' right to judge As well as your's; and ours to judge between you. But, to cut short all difference, I'll go Myself. As you say, Ruthven's tongue alone Can plead the cause of Murray; and his cause Is our's, and Scotland's.âIf I find a stir Of life-blood in his pulse, I'll raise it to A throb shall beat with passion. DOUGLAS. Then you'll work A miracle! MORTON. I'll wake him from the sleep Of death itself, to plead his country's cause. DOUGLAS. We'll see you to the gate, and wish you well. MORTON. Then let's not creep, while time is galloping. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Chamber in Ruthven's House. Ruthven reclining on a couch, Catherine standing by him. CATHERINE. My father, are you better now? RUTHVEN. Look out O'er yonder hill, where winter, breaking up His snowy camp, is hastening to be gone. Such is my state! CATHERINE. And yet, that gentle sleep, From which you've just awakened, gives me hope, The crisis past, you will be well again. RUTHVEN. It may be so; but what have I to wish for In life?âMy country's past a sick man's help, And past a sane man's hope! 'Tis gone to ruin! I've nothing left to wishâto care for, now. CATHERINE. Am I then nothing to you? O, my Father!â Let me not lose your loveâor, if I must, Let it be some time hence,âthat I may play The cheat for once, and die before it come. RUTHVEN. Talk not of dyingâeven in fancy talk not. I may not be a gentle father, Kate, But I'm a loving one. The bird, that feeds Her young with her own flesh, is harsh of note, Compare her with the lark that quits her brood To sing in upper airâO Kateâyou know not, How dear you are to me. CATHERINE. I doâI do, My fatherâand I bless you for't! But comeâ For now I know you love me, will not leave me, Nor send me from you,âI may tell you now The Queen desires my presence at the Court; 'Twas but a moment since, her mission reached me. RUTHVEN. It must not be:âI cannot spare you, Kate: I cannot part with you. She has her friends From every region of the quartered globe:â Let that content her. But, of this same Court You spoke of, prythee tell me what in all Its rare attractions pleased your fancy most, When you were there? The ball! the tournament! CATHERINE. Of all I saw or heard, the Signor's music Was that which won my heart. RUTHVEN. Indeed! CATHERINE. Oh, had you heard him too! You would have said, he was of Orpheus sprung, Or taught his art by syrens, or had traced The mermaid's plaint at sea, and caught it on His harp from the wild waveâor, bolder still, Had mounted to the spheric harmonies, And, where the rolling planets hymn to Heaven, Touched the wrapt choir. RUTHVEN. Give o'er this ill-judged praise; It sounds unseemly from a maiden's lips. Mark me. I hate that Rizzio from my soul. I hate him for his country; his religion: He's a magician too, and practises Upon the Queen with spells. Imp of the devil! He plays the part of Belzebub in Scotland, And sells us all to Rome. Beware of him! [A knocking at the door. How now! more visitors?âWho is't that knocks? MORTON (without). Commend me to Lord Ruthven. Enter Servant. CATHERINE. 'Tis your friend's The Earl of Morton's voice. RUTHVEN. I'll see the Earl. [Exit Servant. Leave me, my child: I'll call you soon again; My heart will miss you. CATHERINE. O my dear, dear father! 'Tis joy to see you thus revived. [Exit. RUTHVEN. Revived! Disease hath worn me from a giant's bulk To an anatomy; melted my flesh, Like wax away at the slow fire of pain; And that incurable malady, old age, Sits on my heart, and sinks me to the grave. Ha! Morton, welcome! Enter Morton. MORTON. How is't with my friend? RUTHVEN. He lives. MORTON. Improves, too. Hope's a good physician; If art should fail, there's strength in nature still. RUTHVEN. Yes; when the limbs are young, the sinews free, The very bones elastic; but, in age, Weak, withered, and though bent, unbending age, The healing office of the blood is o'er, And nature's self is on the side of waste And dissolution. MORTON. Talk not so, nor think so; Remember what you have been. RUTHVEN. That's my torment: For now what am I, grovelling in the dust Even of mine own decay? My sword is bent, My helmet rusted, and the standard brave That, like a skirt of Mars, shook overhead, In the high wind of battle, clings with mould. I have no strength: what can the dying do, But, in the base gradation of their fate, Become the dead, and rot? MORTON. 'Tis on record That CÃ¦sar was addict to faintings, fits, When he made Rome his footstool:âBut remember, His strength was in himself:âhis weakness was A thing of earth:âhe spurned it as an alien, And, standing on the summit of the Age, Looked down upon infirmity! Ruthven! the nobles of this once proud realm, Abandoned by the King, detested by The Queen, opposed by fortune, and forsakenâ I grieve to say itâby the people's love, Which lives not longer than prosperityâ Look to you as their leader! If you spurn 'em There is no single chance for Scotland, but Submit to Rizzio's yoke! RUTHVEN. Fate strike the land With famine first, or with the spotted plague! Rizzio's! to Rizzio's yoke! you should not talk Of Mountebanks, as you would talk of Kings; Nor mix the lofty crime of power's abuse With rascal vices, such as crawl about The heart of such a wretch as Rizzio! MORTON. I speak my fear. RUTHVEN. Then cease to fear, and speak More like yourself. MORTON. The fire of that rebuke Shows Ruthven still alive: I will have hope For Scotland now. RUTHVEN. Whatever I can do To roll back ruin from my native rocks Into the sea, I will adventure with you. We must not be the slaves of sycophants, Nor crouch to fiddling tyrants, while we have A spot of ground to stand on, or lie under. From this time forth I'm one of you again. MORTON. I thought it would be so: I said it would. Ruthven, your hand: I thank you for our countryâ But to the end in view. There are petitions From Edinburghâfrom Dumfries, Perth, and Glasgowâ Praying for Murray's pardon and recall: If, when your health allow, you would present, And by your speech enforce their argumentâ RUTHVEN. Nay, 'tis not that alone can save the state. Rizzio must be got rid ofâDoes the Queen Distinguish him, as she was wont to do Before her marriage? MORTON. More so still, her bounty Heaps riches, favours on him. RUTHVEN. Then 'tis plain We must be rid of himâI see the way. We must search out the guilty secrets of This court, and bare them to the public gazeâ The hidden story of the Bayonne league Must be unravelled; and whatever tends To set the King and Queen at variance nursed, And cherished into life. MORTON. 'Twere well to do'tâ But how is't to be done? RUTHVEN. As every thing That's great and difficult, is done by patient And persevering toil. You've seen a pebble Washed whiter than the fleeces round the moon, And made a thing of cost and ornament, By the untiring wave. There's a deep moral In that small truth: the wave, the ceaseless wave, Hints to the mind the secret of its energy. MORTON. We look to you, my friend, for help and counsel. RUTHVEN. Morton, those same petitions, that you spoke ofâ Are they yet come? MORTON. By this time some of them Must have arrivedâI'll go and see to 't, quickly. RUTHVEN. What is't o'clock? MORTON. The last that struck was four. RUTHVEN. That's late i' the day;âyet, without further pause, See there be sent a trusty messenger To Holyrood. Let him entreat o' the Queen A private audience for an ailing man. I'll make the prayer of those petitioners Speak out. MORTON. So soon, my Lord? RUTHVEN. It cannot be Too soon. Is not our country sinkingâgasping? When Ruin's ireful tooth is in the flesh, An instant is an age. But goâI have Another scheme to manage in your absence: It flashed across my mind, while we were speaking. MORTON. This is indeed a happiness: 'twill cheer Our drooping friends. RUTHVEN. Let them be comforted. Farewell,âno wordsâthey fill the place of action. [Exit Morton. Enter Catherine. Now, Kate! come hither, Kate! and hear good news. Heaven and the lively peril of the times Have righted me.âYour father lives again. CATHERINE. O, not with words, but in my silent heart, I thank the Heavens for this. RUTHVEN. And thank them too For other joys, than old men's lives can give. You must to Court, my girl. CATHERINE. To Court!âI thought 'Twas not your wish. RUTHVEN. But now, my mind is changed. CATHERINE. Yet why dismiss me from my duties here So suddenly?â'Tis true, your health revives: But in a little time 'twill more revive, And I be happier, without the fears That now would haunt meâI should dream of you, And see you on your sick bed languishing, And I not near to chafe your aching brow, Or kiss your burning hand.âLet me not leave you! RUTHVEN. Come, come, shake off this weakness: get you ready. A maid like you should learn to look abroadâ And where the great are found, be found amongst 'emâ Besides, I have my motivesâwhat they are You need not now be told: But go, and henceforth Consider Holyrood your home. CATHERINE. Oh, noâ My home is with my father. RUTHVEN. So it is. Here, in his heart, where you and life are one. But there are claims affection's self must yield to. Markâas you love your country, and the order Of nobles in whose station you were born, And the religion in whose path you walk: In short, as you love all that should be loved, And in that all include myself, your father, 'Tis fitting you should lend a helping hand To those great interests. CATHERINE. What can I do, A trembling maid, incapable and weak, To serve such interests? RUTHVEN. Have you not eyes And ears, to see and hear? Observe what passes At Court. Observe the Queen and Rizzio. CATHERINE. Ha! Am I to act the spy? RUTHVEN. By Heaven, you drive My temper past the stretch of patience!âSpy!â The word was coined to frighten fools from truth. CATHERINE. But is't an office that becomes your daughter? RUTHVEN. To save a nation, we must not be nice About the means.âIf men will sacrifice Themselves, their wives, and children, to deserve The name of patriot, 'tis a proof that rules Of common life are abrogate, and void, In this o'erwhelming claim. Go, do as I Command you. CATHERINE. Sir, you are My father: I must needs obey your mandate. RUTHVEN. Now that's well said; 'tis like my gentle Kate, My own obedient Kate. But you look pale. I cannot bear such looks from you, my child; 'Tis not what death can bring to me, but what It may take from me, fills my soul with fear. Look better, Kate. CATHERINE. I will in time, my father. RUTHVEN. I hope you will!âIn very selfishness I hope you willâor I shall soon be nothing. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Holyrood House. An Open Court. Suitors waiting before the door. Enter George Douglas and Chalmers. CHALMERS. You're an unwilling visitor to Court? DOUGLAS. Unwilling and unwelcome. I hate Rizzio; And he returns it. Once he sneered at me Because I did not walk into the world Through the church door. He should have paid his life for't, But that Lord Morton struck my blade aside, And saved his fiddle-strings. CHALMERS. 'Twas not fair play. But who are these? DOUGLAS. All suitors, as I guess; Come, like ourselves, to swell the great man's levÃ©e. Enter Garcia, with Papers, &amp;c. The Suitors crowd round him. First Suitor. Is Signor David,âis the Secretary At leisure? GARCIA. He will pass anon this way. First Suitor. I come to beg his interest with the Queen. GARCIA. He'll give you audience in the proper course. [Exit. DOUGLAS. Mark you that lofty phraseââHe'll give you audience!â He'll condescend his ear.âIt makes one's blood boil. CHALMERS. Keep down your choler, if you'd speak him fair. Look how they crowd, and cringe, and crawl to him. Enter Rizzio, with Letters. First Suitor. Good Signor! Second Suitor. Signor David! Third Suitor. Signor Rizzio! Second Suitor. Most honorable Secretary! CHALMERS. Soh! They'll make a king of him at last. DOUGLAS. He's that Already, if, to wield the functions, be To be a king. RIZZIO. I cannot hear you now. First Suitor. But one word, Signor; I have a brave son, Who deems it misery to be unknown: A word from you would lift him to distinction. Second Suitor. I have a brother, who, in fighting fields, Hath won his way through danger to neglect: A helping hand from you would make his fortune. RIZZIO. We'll talk of this another timeânot now; For I am pressed by matters of deep moment. Your cause shall fare no worse for your consenting. First Suitor. We will not trespass further, noble Signor. [Exeunt Suitors, bowing. DOUGLAS. They say the Devil has his worshippers, And I believe it.âSir, a word with you. [Coming down. RIZZIO. Ha! gentlemen! I pray you pardon meâ I saw you not before. DOUGLAS. We know what 'tis To wait, Sir. RIZZIO. But you should not practise it, If I had seen you. Is there any thing, So poor a man can do to serve you, Sirs? DOUGLAS. Nothing. Our suit is to Her Majestyâ And from the Lords of Morton and of Ruthven. RIZZIO. I thought Lord Ruthven was abed, and ill? DOUGLAS. But there are two ways out of sickness;âone Is death: the other is recovery: He chose the latter. RIZZIO. And a prudent choice. But what has he? what can he have to ask Of the Queen's favour? CHALMERS. To be honoured with A private audience, that he may deliver, With his own hand, petitions from the people. RIZZIO. You know, the Secretary should present Such documents. CHALMERS. But then, a Lord, methinks May claim some relaxation of the rule. RIZZIO. A friendly Lord. DOUGLAS. And who says Ruthven's not so? RIZZIO. Sir, 'tis enough, the Queen will listen to Lord Morton; but I cannot answer for The other Lord. DOUGLAS. Then, why presume for either? RIZZIO. Presume? DOUGLAS. Ha! Does the word offend your Highness? RIZZIO. It is not gracious, Sir, to taunt me thus, When I bespeak you fairly. What I said Was in obedience, not in pride: I dare not Mention Lord Ruthven to the Queen. DOUGLAS. And why? Because an insect buzzing round her ear Hath trickled poison in't. Why, 'twas but now, Not weeks, nor days, but some few hours ago, The Queen received his daughter as a friend: Is't possible she can account the father An enemy? RIZZIO. 'Tis not for me to say; But what my orders are I must abide by. DOUGLAS. This comes of harbouring knaves and sycophants. CHALMERS. Douglas, be patient. RIZZIO. Let him rail, good Sir: My duty to the Queen forbids retort; And so I take my leave, to spare disturbance. [Exit. CHALMERS. We've lost our suit. DOUGLAS. 'Tis all the better: Ruthven Will urge the strong petitions still more strongly Before the open Court.âLet's hasten to him. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A State Apartment in Holyrood House. Queen, Countess of Argyle, Marguerite, and Celine. Ladies discovered laughing. Catherine apart. QUEEN. Hark'ye, Argyle! Is't fitting they should laugh thus; Talk thus, and bear thus hard upon our cousin Of England? She's a maiden Queen, you know! MARGUERITE. She's an old witch. CELINE. A red haired witch. MARGUERITE. A grey one. ARGYLE. Both red and grey; a sweet variety. MARGUERITE. 'Tis said, her heart hath felt the power of love. CELINE. And welcomed it, or fame has much belied her. QUEEN. O slanderers! Why! a Queen fares with your tongues No better than a chambermaid. But where's Our Secretary, Rizzio? CELINE. The last time I saw the Signor, he was on his knees Before the picture of your Majesty That hangs i'th'Hall. Thinking himself alone, He poured forth such sweet raptures to the picture, That if 'twere any thing but oil and canvas, 'Twould have walked down to him. QUEEN. Yes, if it had Your love of flattery. Enter Rizzio with papers. But here he is; Now, Signor, what are these? RIZZIO. Letters, so please Your Majesty. QUEEN. Come they from France? RIZZIO. From France, And England too. [Giving letters. QUEEN. And what has England now to say to us? RIZZIO. Some new remonstrance touching your late marriage. QUEEN. Let her remonstrate with her looking-glass Against her small grey eyes, and freckled face. [Reads. Ha! look you here! She calls my lord and husband The King, her servant! What! are Kings and Queens But vassals to this haughty woman's pride? [Flourish. RIZZIO. Madam, the King, the Ambassador of England, And all your Court approach. QUEEN. I'm glad to see The Ambassador, that he may know my mind. Enter the King, Court, Ambassador, Bothwell, &amp;c. King and Queen sit. So, Sir! your Queen would queen it every where; Aye, even in Scotland, as this protest shews, And her known succour to the traitor, Murray. AMBASSADOR. Beseech you, Madam, to think lightly of it: The marriage o'er what can protesting signify? QUEEN. 'Tis strange, methinks, she has not yet protested Against the unlicensed rising of the sun; The flowing of the tides; the mad career Of winds, and other insubordinate acts Which unsubmissive nature practises! Yet, let her look to her own crown, or rather To that she calls her own; and say, if right Were done between us, who should reign in England? AMBASSADOR. I dare not, Madam, for the love I bear Your Majesty, report so rash a speech To England's Courtâthe answer would be war. BOTHWELL. Well, Sir, suppose it war! RIZZIO. My Lord, forbearâ War should be met, as wise men meet misfortune, With manly temper, not with levity: A demon's breath alone should fan the flame. QUEEN. Rizzio advises rightly. Sir Nicholas, inform the Queen, your mistress, That, of our own free will and royal power, We've ta'en the Earl of Darnley to our throne. 'Tis done; and that's our answer. AMBASSADOR. Gracious Madam! I will repeat your answer faithfully. [Exit with suite. DARNLEY (descending from the throne). What! no appeal to me! to none but Rizzio! They rule the land between 'em: let 'em rule it. [aside. QUEEN (descending from the throne.) You've heard, my Lords, the insolence of England. 'Twere well her pride stopped hereâbut we have learnt, By sure advices, she gives succour and Protection to our enemies. There's Murray: You know what I have done and suffered for him. His titles and estates were all the gift Of this fool hand; yet now he turns upon it! Elizabeth abets his hostile purpose; Nay, more, supplies him with the means of our Annoyanceâis this well? RIZZIO. 'Twill come at last To blows with England's Queen. QUEEN. I seek it not. But, if 'tis forced upon me, let it come. DARNLEY. She's all the sovereign;âno appeal to me! But what am I?âShe has her councillor. [aside. MELVILLE. Madam, the King seems moved. QUEEN. How now, my Lord! Has aught displeased you? DARNLEY. No; 'tis nothingâbut The vision of the matrimonial crown Will sometimes cross my thought. QUEEN. Remember, Sir, You are a King. DARNLEY. Yes, yes, you call me King, As slaves are called by mighty CÃ¦sar's name, To mock their wretchedness more bitterly: I thank you for the boon. QUEEN. O! Darnley, Darnley! Have I not done enough in doing all? [A Page enters. PAGE. Madam; the Lords of Ruthven and of Morton, Crave, with the younger Douglas, and some others, Permission to approach your Majesty. QUEEN. Admit them; we've almost forgot their faces. Enter Ruthven, Morton, Douglas, Chalmers, Maitland, Lindsay, and others. You've ta'en us by surprise, my Lord; we thought Your sickness more acute. RUTHVEN. Great Madam, there Are claims that sickness self must yield to: death Alone can cancel them. I am deputed By hundredsâthousandsâof your Majesty's Most loyal subjects, to lay at your feet These, their petitions. QUEEN. What's the prayer they urge? RUTHVEN. In chief, the pardon of the Earl of Murray. QUEEN. Hear this, my Lords: his pardon! Murray's! thatâ What shall I call him? RUTHVEN. Call him what he isâ Your brother, Madam. QUEEN. Then, the baser he, To be my foe. RUTHVEN. And the more blessed you, To be his pardoner. QUEEN. His! his! that traitor's! Neverâso help me heaven, and as I hope, Myself, for mercy! RUTHVEN. Ha! mark that! you hope it; O! give it to that hope. You cannot tearâ Tear, with your delicate hand, the bonds that nature Tied with her own:âyou cannot put to death Affection in your living bosom:âno!â Pride, passion, or some bitter ecstacy May, for a moment, hide it from yourself, But there it is, mixed in the blood that sweeps The circle of your being, to revive Again, when the rash fit has spent its rage, And mercy claims her sway. QUEEN. Should mercy shut Her eyes to guilt? RUTHVEN. No; but with open eyes Should pardon it: for what is mercy? Is't not Forgiveness? And what is forgiveness, but Remission of the penalty of crime? If we must keep our mercy for the guiltless, We might as well give alms to rich abundance, Fire to the tropic's arid bosom, frost To the baked pole, and raindrops to the deep! The fault you hint at is in mercy's self, That spreads her wing above the head of guilt, And saves it for repentance. QUEEN. Say no more. BOTHWELL. Ruthven knows well that Murray still persists In plotting for the ruin of his country. RUTHVEN. Ha! Bothwell, is that you? I thought so! You Know where to plant the foot, when a man's down;â And Murray's down. BOTHWELL. And you know how to take The part of Rebels. RUTHVEN. Not, when you were one. DARNLEY. But is't not true, what Bothwell says of Murray? Has he not sworn it? RUTHVEN. O! when Bothwell swears, I know what side the truth's on. BOTHWELL. Sneering villain! [touching his sword. RUTHVEN. Psha! Take your hand from off that heated steelâ 'Twill burn your fingers else. BOTHWELL. You need not fearâ I thirst not for your blood. RUTHVEN. I know not that; But this I knowâmy blood, Sir, hath its price; And he must be no niggard of his own, Who takes it at the cost 'twill put him to. RIZZIO. My Lords, is this a tone for the Queen's presence? RUTHVEN. What crawling thing is that, whose hiss I hear? DOUGLAS. 'Tis Rizzio!âDavid Rizzio! RUTHVEN. He, who plays The lute, and sings! Back, minion, to your place! Your office is to whisper, Sir; to whisperâ Not to speak out like a man; for that were e'en As if a mole should strive to scale the wall, Instead of undermining it. Look to Your occupation;â'twill be better for youâ Neglecting it, you'll lose your way, and fall Wretchedly into mischief. RIZZIO. Still I say You ought not to forget, Her Majesty, The Queen is here. RUTHVEN. So is the King here too!â And asks no upstart to assume his power. DARNLEY. 'Tis true, that Rizzio takes too much upon himâ QUEEN. He takes my part. Is that a fault? to take His mistress' part against that scornful man? RUTHVEN. I do beseech you, Madam, pardon meâ I bend with reverence to the throne and youâ But, when I'm barked at by so many curs, Passion will leap the bounds of ceremony, And anger bite its cords:âforgive me, Madam. QUEEN. Pass to the next Petition. RUTHVEN. There is yet Another prayer in thisâit humbly begs For the dismissal of the foreigners. QUEEN. What have they done? RUTHVEN. No matterâthey are foreign. Our ancestors were wont to hate that nameâ And their example still should govern us. QUEEN. But they're all dead. You would not have the dead Govern the living!âIf the dead could peep Out of their graves, they would not know this world To be the world they used to tread upon;â Why should they rule it then? Death knows no change; But life is full of changes, like the sky With many weathers; and our planet rolls Amongst a thousand scattered influences All turning upon change. RIZZIO. Lord Ruthven speaks As if he'd stamp upon the rolling earth And cry outââstop!â to the spheres. DOUGLAS. Peace! Dastard, peace! My Lord! he sees your health has suffered lately!â That gives him courage. RUTHVEN. Be't so, 'tis his instinct. The cur will bark to see the lion fall. RIZZIO. 'Tis possible, you may o'er-rate your lion, And under-rate your cur. I've known such slipsâ But why denounce me? 'Sdeath, I'm not a wormâ A thing without a name, save the vile sound That covers all the species ignominiously;â I have a man's heart beating in my breast, And a man's arm to guard it. DARNLEY. Madam, are The nobles to be taunted by your minion? QUEEN. If nobles will begin the strife of words, I cannot regulate its course to please themâ My business in this audience is to listen! But those who break down fences should not murmur That the way's clear for others as for them. DARNLEY. I thought you'd take this course to succour him. QUEEN. Indeed, Sir! As for these petitioners, Your clients, my Lord Ruthven, let them know That we will duly weigh their least requests, And to our best of judgment, deal with 'em. Rizzio, attend usâwe shall need your skill In harmony to drown the discords here. [Flourish. Exit Queen, followed by Rizzio, &amp;c. DARNLEY. Ruthven? RUTHVEN. You called me? DARNLEY. Yes! I'd speak with you. [Ruthven dismisses Douglas. O Ruthven, be my friend, for I have need. RUTHVEN. I am your friendâwhat can I do to serve you? DARNLEY. How should the wronged be served, but by revenge? Is every woman, think you, music's slave? RUTHVEN. There was a Queen of Egypt onceâI mean The jilt that made a fool of Antonyâ And she loved music too! We know the dance She led her dupe.âBy heaven! I'd rather die Of Egypt's plague than trust its Cleopatras! DARNLEY. You'd say that I'm deceived, disgraced, dishonoured. RUTHVEN. Do you suspect them, then? DARNLEY. Suspect!âBy heaven You've almost stopped my breath with a word! You dropped Some hints of this before, and so did Morton;â Hints that have scorched me with the penal fire Of this world's hell; and yet the miscreant lives! Will no one rid me of that David? RUTHVEN. Hush! Keep back your vengeance 'till we've further proof. DARNLEY. You talk of vengeance, as if 'twere an art Men learnt at school, and not a rooted instinct. RUTHVEN. I talk of vengeance, as an act of reason. Why does the lightning's flash so seldom kill, While the poised engine of inferior fire Counts every round to death? Because the one Bursts from the bosom of the thunder cloud, And one is thoughtâdirected. Leave revenge To time and me: 'twill not be lost between us. Enter Douglas. But look! George Douglas comes again! How now? DOUGLAS. The Commons are assembled to discuss The subject of the matrimonial crown. I thought it right to warn you. DARNLEY. There again My wrongs cry out. The Queen declines to use, Without their sanction, her prerogative. RUTHVEN. I'll try what may be done to win their favour. Come, Douglas: as we go, I've something for Your private ear, to help the working of Our plans. Farewell, Sir: when we meet again, I hope to bring the Crown along with me. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Gallery. The Queen, Countess of Argyle, Catherine, Celine, Marguerite, and Ladies, &amp;c. discovered. Rizzio at the Harp. Music. ARGYLE. Would you not augur, from his bended brow, Leaning on thought, he loved ambitiously? And so he does; but mark him, when he strikes The magic string, and lifts his eyes to Heaven, As if he looked at inspiration. CATHERINE. O there's a melody even in the pause And stoppage of his song; for fancy fills The resting place more sweet than others' music [Bold MusicâSymphony. QUEEN. Hark! hark! the echoes ring. [Air. (Leaning on Argyle.) Is it the soul Of genius, or the storm that wakes that note? Or heaven or earth that tunes it to the swell Of mighty winds and tempests? Hark, again The minstrel hangs his head in melancholyâ [soft music. And now the zephyrs steal among the strings To touch his hand and die.âIt was not falsehood That bade the poet fancy stones to move; For there's a spirit in creation, A mind in matter, captivate to song:â The very comet, in his random sphere, Obeys its voice, and smooths his bristling fires, To listen while the golden planets sing;â The smallest clod of earth does, in its fair Proportion to the wheeling worlds above, Sustain the universal harmony, And follow nature in her heavenly round! 'Twas therefore truth, not falsehood, told how trees And stones could move, when music tried her skill; And thus the poet's thought is justified! CELINE. âNay I'll appeal at once to our good Queen [to Catherine. âFor her decisionâPlease your Majesty, âThe Lady Catherine will contend with us âThat Scotland boasts a brighter sun than France. MARGUERITE. âWhy, now in truth does the sun ever shine on't? CATHERINE. âAy, sweeter than on any other shore, âThe wind may blow on Scotland harshly, yet âIts breath is healthful, and at winter's worst âEndurable, and when the summer comes, â'Tis not a demon from the burning zone âThat fires our climate, but a genial power, âThe sister of the spring illumines it. âO! how the hills and valleys welcome her! âThe poorest weed that grows attempts a flower âTo cast it at her feet. QUEEN. âWell spoken, dear âEnthusiast, lover of thy native land.â But this is too akin to gravity, And we've enow of that when business calls us. Come, what device? We've no sour faces here, To make their sourer comments on our mirth; So we'll enact the matter of a play, In our court fashionâha! ha! when the Signor wakes Out of his sleep. [Pointing to Rizzio, who in wrapt in thought. RIZZIO. Forgive an absent mind,â And yet not absent neither; for my dream Was e'en where all my thoughts are. All. But the play! Let's have the play! QUEEN. I'll take the heroine's part; And, Rizzio, you shall thunder in the hero. CATHERINE. Good Heaven! Has madness slipped its chain to make A show of Scotland's throne? [Aside. QUEEN. Now for the cue. [Goes to Rizzio. Suppose yourself some troubadour of old, And me the lady of your love.âCall down The muse from Heaven to lend her burning tongue, That you may speak in fire:âthere is my hand. Begin your speech with wax or alabaster. RIZZIO. What say you to the snow so white, so pureâ So like the mind that prompts this beauteous hand To every gracious act? Oh, Mary! Queen! The tongue that trembles to pronounce thy name, Can ill perform thy praise, unequalled fair, Surpassing all that ever fable told Of loveliness. [Kneeling, he is about to rise. QUEEN. Good minstrel, ere you rise, Wear this in token of your Queen's regard: Around thy neck I twine the ribbon's coil, An emblem of the love that merit wins: And, pendent at thine heart, my likeness place To lastâ [Hanging a portrait round his neck. RIZZIO. Till death; for death shall find it there. QUEEN. Now, friends, your judgment on this moving sceneâ Which is the better actorâhe, or I? CELINE. The Queen, who still is best in every thing, Is best in this. QUEEN. Go to! You flatter me. What says our thoughtful friend? CATHERINE. If acting be The best that is the most unlike pretence, I vote the Signor first; tho' both were better Than either ought to be. QUEEN. Tis well defined. 'You're a just judge, and I confirm your judgment. But, Rizzio, we must mend our ways, and turn Worse actors to be more approved of. Come, The play is ended, and the banquet waits, And welcome is already at the door, Impatient for your salutation. [Exeunt all but Rizzio. RIZZIO. Oh! that I were a troubadour indeed, And thou my lady love! too charming Queen! I do remember, when I saw her first, She deigned to notice and to honour me; I kissed her white hand, as the votary kisses The waxen image of his patron saint, And then began the dream that ends in madness! Come, then, thou bright perdition of the mind; Thou bane of manly thought, and enterprise; But dearer than their fame, whate'er thou art, That in mysterious thraldom hold my soul; I'm thine, and though destruction yawn, I clasp thee!â Garcia! how now?âWhence come you? Enter Garcia. GARCIA. From your friends, Who suffer much indignity, because Of your high bearing to the nobles. Theyâ Your friends, I meanâare discontent at this. RIZZIO. Indeed! Then is Your mission to advise me how to crawl? I've had some stern instructors in that lesson. GARCIA. You feel too deeply these indignities. RIZZIO. Tis not so easy, as your thoughts may tell you, To bear insulting pride. You'll say, despise it: But there's a stingâa galling sting in scorn That finds the weaker part of nature out, And flings the nobler moral to the windâ Wouldst have me thank contempt? GARCIA. I'd teach you patience. RIZZIO. Observe how darkly Douglas scowls upon us. But patience is a virtueâyou shall see That I can practise it. Enter Douglas and Chalmers. DOUGLAS. Is there no corner Free from these foreign reptiles? RIZZIO. Come: he's in A mood to quarrel now. We have no chance But instant flight. [With affected humility to Garcia. There's no way else to save us. GARCIA. I hope there's some salvation in our own Right hands, if we're put to't. RIZZIO. No, that would be High bearing, and I'm convert to the low. [With a sneer. CHALMERS. They speak of us. DOUGLAS. Ay, let them.âRizzio, I Owe you a favour for my mother's sake. You chafed her memory once, and, like a dog, Barked at her grave. RIZZIO. 'Twas in my passion, Sir, A passion you provoked by fouler language. But as it is, I'm sorry for itâForget it. DOUGLAS. Your sorrow is a cheat,âa coward's falsehood! GARCIA. Falsehood! Did you hear that? Coward and false! Is your hand palsied?âIf you dare not use it, [to Rizzio, in great agitation. Give me the sword. [offering to take his sword. RIZZIO. Hold off! my sword's my own. You see I can forbear;âremember that, And so report it. As for this small man [pointing to Douglas. With the great voice, I have no fear of him; He thunders, but not lightens,âharmless noise. DOUGLAS. Find me an equal who will tell me so, And mark how soon my swordâ RIZZIO. What could it do? An ungrown boy would whip you through the ribs While you were looking for your courage to Persuade it from the scabbard! DOUGLAS. Foreign slave! Again thou ly'st. RIZZIO. Take back the lie thrice-charged. For theeâthy very name's a lie; thy place Is with the caitiffs, who take pride in shame, And know not how to feel even for their mothers. DOUGLAS. Ha, villain! Draw! Drawâand defend thy life. RIZZIO. Blows are the best defence when ruffians brave us. [they fight. Darnley, Morton, Lords, and Officers, &amp;c. &amp;c. rush in. DARNLEY. Beat down their swords and seize 'em. Now what's here? A riot in the palace! Rizzio! You Shall answer this. RIZZIO. And Douglas, Royal Sir,â He shared the fault, and should the penalty. DARNLEY. Bear him to the strong chamber, [pointing to Rizzio. Till we've time To sit in judgment on his great offence. RIZZIO. Remember, Sir, I claimâ DARNLEY. Away with him. [Rizzio is borne off. Exeunt all but Darnley. Now, now he's in my power and he shall feel it. Before another night steals on the world I'll rid myself of him. But where is Ruthven? He promised soon to greet me with the news How the bloat Commons have decided on My title to the matrimonial Crown.â Let them beware. Rizzio shall feel my power, And all who brave my hate, shall taste my vengeance. [exit. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Palace. Enter Darnley and Melville. Darnley pacing the Apartment. DARNLEY. I must see Ruthven, ere I deal with David. I must possess the matrimonial Crown, Ere I can think of aught;âaye, e'en of vengeance. Look from the casement. Is there no one coming? MELVILLE. None, please your Majesty! DARNLEY. No Ruthven yet! Go look again. There's not a knave amongst 'em Who brings me news he thinks will gall my pride, But seems as if it pleased him. MELVILLE. Yonder, Sir, Lord Ruthven comes at last. DARNLEY. 'Tis well! 'Tis well! Comes he like one commissioned with a crown? Where is he?â'Sdeath! how slow the sick man moves: But may be 'tis th' intelligence he bears Is not worth moving to communicate. Hold! Here he comes: begone, and leave us. Now! Is the Crown mine? Ruthven enters as the Attendant goes out. RUTHVEN. They have refused it, Sir. DARNLEY. Refused! They know my power, and dare they for Their lives refuse? What reason did they give? They had some reason, or some pretext which They called a reason, for adventuring! What was't? RUTHVEN. Let me entreat your Majesty To be content with what you've heard; 't would rouse Your anger, and distress my tongue, to trace Their insolent proceeding further. DARNLEY. Nayâ Speak, I command you. RUTHVEN. As you'll have it so, Why so you shall. One of 'em said, the Queen, When she proclaimed you King, usurp'd a pow'r Not her's by law. Another charged you with Truckling to Rizzio, and oppresing him When you had gained your ends. All were against you. DARNLEY. And you heard all, and brought away your sword Covered up safely in its leathern case! You should have spurn'd,âdenounced their villainy, Thrust back their foul decision through their teeth. RUTHVEN. How, Sir! I'm not a bravo, nor a cut-throat, hired To stop men's mouths with murder when they exercise A civil right. DARNLEY. Ha! traitor! RUTHVEN. Traitor! DARNLEY. Slave! RUTHVEN. King, you're ungrateful. DARNLEY. Dar'st thou tell me so? Then take thy fate. [rushes at him with his sword. RUTHVEN. [striking the sword from his hand. Not from a hand like thine. Go, Sir! Pick up your swordâyou'll find the fragments. DARNLEY. [After a pause of great agitation. What have I done? 'Twas madness drove me to The desperate act.âOh, Ruthven! Once my friend, Canst thou forgive? RUTHVEN. If I could not forgive, Where would be Darnley now? Enter Morton. Ha! Morton!âyou Have come in time to reach the King his sword: But wipe it first;âthe blade hath met a stain. MORTON. [Takes up the sword, and presents it to the King. Receive it, Royal Sir. Ruthven, how's this? Methinks the ground's no place for such a weapon. RUTHVEN. Then, Morton, take my word, 'tis better there Than in bad hands that know not how to use it. But come; what's past is gone: let's look before us. You've business, may be, to despatch. MORTON. I came To ask the King what shall be done with Rizzio? DARNLEY. Ruthven, our quarrel's healed: you'll not refuse To lend your counsel? RUTHVEN. Sir, the course is plain. It needs no counsel. Let him have the form Of trial: by all means the form: what else He gets, 'twill be for you to take good care of. DARNLEY. I'll have him brought before me on the instant. Go, Morton, see it done. MORTON. He waits without: A moment will suffice to bring him here. [exit. RUTHVEN. It were not wise that we should all assist In this transaction; therefore I'll withdraw. I gave my daughter cause t' expect me soon: But by the time you've heard the charge, I will Return to meet you. DARNLEY. Fail not to attend. [exit Ruthven. Now for this whipster who reviles my power, Usurps my place, and makes his fortune by His impudence! I'll stop his proud career. Re-enter Morton, followed by Rizzio, Garcia, George Douglas, Chalmers, Melville, &amp;c. MORTON. Stand forward, Rizzio, at the King's command; And you, George Douglas, the accuser, stand Opposed to him. DARNLEY. (To Rizzio.) Are you prepared to plead To the offence whereof you are accused? Or would you, by a free acknowledgment, Throw yourself on our mercy? RIZZIO. Royal Sir, Most willingly do I confess my fault So far as I have erred. But if 'tis meant (As I collect from what has reached mine ear) To charge me with the onset in th' assaultâ That I deny. The man who charges meâ Young Douglas thereâhe was the first to strike. 'Tis true I struck again, but then my sword Was less a weapon to me than a shield. MELVILLE. Stand back, my Lords; make way there for the Queen. DARNLEY. How's this? The Queen! Madam, I did not look To meet you here. Enter Queen, attended by Ladies. QUEEN. No, Sirâwe seldom meet; But, as the fickle will of accident Has thrown us, by some strange mistake, together I hope we shall agree. DARNLEY. I hope so, too, For the crown's honour and its dignity: I would support it, tho' I wear it not. QUEEN. What is the present stage the cause has reach'd? DARNLEY. Douglas accuses Rizzio as th' aggressor In an assault upon his life; and Rizzio Admits the assault, but not th' aggression, which He charges upon Douglas. Our palace was the scene of violence. Their witnesses are equal, it appears, In number, but if rank should turn the scaleâ RIZZIO. Oh, Madam! Pause before you so determine: Pause, and consider well. Truth has no rule Of rank: 'twas made for all mankind; and must Be sought for in th' essential part of man, The mind, that is the man. DOUGLAS. 'Tis ever thus He talks of station with contempt;âthere's scarce A lord in Scotland but has felt his tongue. RIZZIO. Say rather there are few but with their tongues Have injured me. They treat me like a slave; They call me base musician, mountebank; They elbow me in court, frown on me in The streets: they set their menials to insult me. Oh, 'tis fine pastime for the lordly pack To tear a poor man's self-respect to pieces! Then, if I call 'em to account, they jeer And laughâthat laugh is worse than death to me. DOUGLAS. Hark, how he rails against the nobly born! RIZZIO. I do not rail against the nobly born When merit stamps their claim.âI honour worth; And rankâfor aught I know, who cannot boast itâ May help the good that nature must begin. But, when I see hard hearted pride rejoicing To crush the weak, by Heaven! it drives me mad To think that one man should be born for power, And t' other for oppression. DARNLEY. Will you hear This insolence? QUEEN. Not if I thought it such. DARNLEY. Then let's decide the cause, and stop the pleading. QUEEN. We have no clue to guide us through the maze Of contrariety. DARNLEY. But we can judge Between the credit due to men of worth And men of yesterday? DOUGLAS. It asks no skill To weigh the credit of a base Italian. RIZZIO. But, wherefore base?âExplain. Was Rome of old A land of baseness? Were her patriots base? Were the great CÃ¦sars knaves? and Cicero! Was he a cheat, and Horace a buffoon? These were your base Italians! DOUGLAS. Nay, you speak From booksâI spoke of living men. RIZZIO. And I Of men who live for ever! Men, whose names Were, like their souls, immortal!âmen who stood Upon the mountain top of the whole world, The very Ida of the intellect! But, look againâI take a later day, When Italy and base Italians saved The wreck of learning, and the fountain springs Of liberty and glory from the Goth. What can you shew to match that matchless claim?â The glorious East, that in its bosom wears The morning, like a jewel, never shone So bright, as when the gates of Italy Opened to let the flood of science out Upon the world, and gilded all the sphere! You talk of base Italians! Learn to read, And you'll talk otherwise. DARNLEY. The Queen may choose To hear this boastful language, but it shall not Turn us from justice, in whose name and by The weight and power of whose authority We banish you from Scotland. QUEEN. How! my Lord? DARNLEY. Rizzio is banished from this land for ever, Or I am King no more. QUEEN. Oh, be a King! Put on the real crown, the kingly mind, And spurn injustice, as the antipathy Of your proud office, which is outraged by The very sound o' the name. DARNLEY. Ha! would you plead, Before my face, to save him? Thus it is Your favour to him makes your name a byword On every ribbald tongueâ'Tis time 'twere changed. QUEEN. Is this a horrid dream, or a more horrid Reality? Am I the Queen of Scots, Or, as I seem to be, some helpless wretch, Insulted by some high barbarian? No, Sir; I'm still the Queen, and in the name Of my prerogative, I here reverse Your sentence, and deliver David Rizzio From your injustice! Rizzio, you are free; Free, as the King himself, to live in Scotland! RIZZIO. I know not what to sayâMy brain! my brain! QUEEN. Yet hold! There's yet one chance to save this breach. [motions back the Lords. Recall the hasty word your passion spoke; Revoke the sentence by your own decree, And I, who set the Crown upon your head, Will make it grow with greatness! DARNLEY. 'Tis in vain. I stand upon my rightâYou talk to marble. QUEEN. I talk to coarser and to harder stone, That never could be hewn into man's image,â The rock, the impenetrable rock. Farewell! From this time forth our fates are separate. [going. RIZZIO. Oh, Madam! Royal Mary! Let me speak Before you go. And yet, the monstrous charge! Th'inhuman blasphemy! It shocks my soul To give it so much entertainment As to expose it! Sir, you are abused: Some fiend has whispered in your ear to damn you: Oh, drive the thought back to the hell it came from. Look there! look there! even at your Queen and Wife! Is there no process of conviction quicker Than lightning strikes, to strike persuasion through you, Where virtue shines from such a heaven as that, And makes a doubt a crime? DARNLEY. I'll hear no more. QUEEN. 'Twere useless now, for now I've done with you. [Exit with Suite. DARNLEY. Why stand you there t'insult me with your presence? Know you not you are free? Begone! [to Rizzio. Leave me, my friends. [Exeunt Conspirators, &amp;c. RIZZIO. Farewell, Sir! The hour will come you'll think of this and weep! [Exit. DARNLEY. The hour is come I'll think of this and vengeance. Now, where is Ruthven? Enter Ruthven, followed by Catherine. RUTHVEN. At your bidding, Sir,â With further proof to satisfy your mind. DARNLEY. I need no further proof. The Queen has snatched Her minion from my gripe! RUTHVEN. That's strong, indeed! And yet there's stronger still. 'Twill take you but A moment's time to hear. Stand forward, Kate. Look up, and tell the King what you have seenâ For, mark me well! I know what you have seenâ Since you have been at Court. CATHERINE. And was't for this You brought me here? I've seen no wrong at Court, Or, if I did, 'tis not for me to name it. RUTHVEN. Shrink not, my child: I do not ask you for One word beyond the simple facts you've witnessed; But justice calls for them. CATHERINE. What is't you mean? RUTHVEN. There are but two short questions, and the answers May be as short. In truth a word's a volume. Was there a play performed at Court, in which The actors were the Queen and Rizzio? CATHERINE. O Heaven! The Queen's undone! [Aside. RUTHVEN. Speakâwas there such a play? CATHERINE. There wasâin harmless mirth. RUTHVEN. And was her picture, by the Queen's own hand, Placed round the neck of Rizzio? CATHERINE. 'Twas so placed; But thenâ RUTHVEN. No doubt, in harmless mirth again. [to Darnley. DARNLEY. 'Tis proof on proof: their guilt's as clear as day: So let us make their crime and punishment A lesson to the world. CATHERINE. Oh, Royal Sir, For mercy's sake impute not guilt to that Most innocent act! My father was deceived: He heard it with a false construction From spiesâfrom fiends, whose devilish art it is, When they tell truth, to tell it still untruly. RUTHVEN. Why will you harm yourself and vex the King? CATHERINE. I know not why my heart has grown so bold, But I could speak before th' assembled earth In such a cause. Hear me, upon my knees. Remember, King, your Queen is innocent. By yon bless'd beam of light, still warm from Heav'n, That beam is not more innocent of darkness Than she of guilt. DARNLEY. Your facts disprove your oath. CATHERINE. No, on my life; no, on my soul, they do not! Try them in righteous scales; dash the false weight Of preconceived suspicion to the ground; Allow for human weakness in the judge, As well as in th' accus'd, and you'll not find That facts are traitors to the cause of virtue. RUTHVEN. Come, Sirâshe wrings my soul. DARNLEY. We will not hear her. CATHERINE. Justice hears all. [Exit Darnley. Catherine seizes Ruthven as he is following. Oh, stay, my father, stay! Leave me not thus abandoned by the thought That I have been the cursed cause of mischief To my kind patroness, the Queen. Speak to me One gentle word, for I am weak and faint, And may not long survive to trouble you. RUTHVEN. I thought I was all iron, but you've found The way to melt the ore. Why do you talk Of weakness? Is't to wound your father's heart? CATHERINE. O no, no, no! I love that heart too well. RUTHVEN. Then give it credit for an honest purpose. Nay, loose me, for the King expects me now. [Darnley calls without âLord Ruthven.â He waits! Let go your hold! I must not stayâ Nayâthough it break my heart, I must break from thee. [breaks from her, and exit. CATHERINE. What shall I do? I'll to the Queen at onceâ If I can yet persuade her part from Rizzio, They may be saved; if not, destruction waits 'em! [exit. SCENE II. A Gallery in the Palace. Enter Queen, followed by Rizzio, as importuning her. Ladies remain near the door. QUEEN. Rizzio, I tell thee, no! I'll stake my throne Upon this issue. Ere he shall prevail Against me, kingdom, life, and all shall go. RIZZIO. 'Tis terrible! If ruin came alone, I could defy; but to pull thee down too! QUEEN. If you go now, they'll say 'twas guilty fearâ The flight of conscious crime. I'll have my will Obeyed, and not the King's; my pride demands it. Therefore, no more of that.âBut, tell me, Rizzio, How is't that slander has the power to blast The fairest fame, and virtue none to save it? RIZZIO. Alas! 'twas so ordained. A word, a look Needs nothing but a foul interpreter To turn its simple language into shame. And what can virtue do? 'Tis on the rose The canker feeds; 'tis in the blossom's core The ugly worm carouses.âSuch is slander! QUEEN. Oh, Rizzio! 'tis a fearful thing to look Upon the naked skeleton of life; 'Tis worse than that of death for all its glare. Enter Catherine. CATHERINE. Where is the Queen? Let me but see the Queen. QUEEN. How! Lady Catherine! CATHERINE. Madam! I am come To warn you. Ha! the Signor, too! [Seeing Rizzio. Forgive My boldnessâ'tis no time to stand on forms When vengeance is abroad. QUEEN. Vengeance! CATHERINE. Oh! Madam! I fear the worst! my father and the King. QUEEN. I know their hate, but is a Queen to fear it? CATHERINE. 'Tis not their hate I'd have you fear, but error That ruins more than hate. Suspicion has Possessed them with strange fancies: and what end May come of it no tongue can tell! O, Signor! Help me to plead this cause, for you are e'en The mark of their suspicion:â'tis most trueâ Then let me warn you, as my purpose was, To part for ever. RIZZIO. Ha! For ever, say you? By Heaven, I knew not till I had heard it from Another's mouth like a death doom announced, How hard it was to part! CATHERINE. Ah! Madam, hear meâYou may never hear, Nor see me more. By nature weak, I feel My little strength outworn. If, as they say, [leans on one of the ladies. 'Tis sometimes giv'n the dying to foresee; There is a horror in th' obscure of time Dependent on this hour's decision! Part! I speak it from the threshold of the tombâ Waste not the time in words, or thoughtsâbut part! [Exit. As Catherine goes off, shouts and sounds of tumult are heard at a distance. QUEEN. What dreadful sounds are these? RIZZIO. The whole day long An angry spirit has displayed itself Among the populace, and now it seems To rush with louder fury through the air? QUEEN. What is the cause? RIZZIO. Their hate of foreigners, But most of me. I am the cause, and, yet I have not strength to tear myself away, And seek oblivion in the death of exile. Hark! There again! The sound grows louder still! Is't hope that's coming to an end? QUEEN. No, no; Hope has no end, but, even when life is sped, Leaps on the shadow of another world And sweeps through all eternity. [Enter Celine How now? CELINE. Fly, Madam! Save yourself! A mob is at The gate, demanding vengeance upon those Who caused your Majesty to sign the league Of Bayonne. RIZZIO. Traitors! Tyrants! Madam, give My sword but leave to make this cause its own. QUEEN. No, Sir; no foreign swords; 'tis not the way To quiet Scotsmen. But, if outrage should Approach us in our palace, you shall guard Our person and our life. RIZZIO. I take the charge; More proud of it than fields where glory grows But here's another messenger! What news? Enter Garcia. GARCIA. The tumult's at its height, and every moment 'Tis feared the troops must fire to save the palace. QUEEN. Let all things else be tried first. Hold! I'll go And shew myself. RIZZIO. Stay, Madam,âThink upon The risk you run. QUEEN. This is no time for thought; And, as for risk, the way to 'scape's to meet it. [Exit, followed by Celine. RIZZIO. By thee I take my stand, upon the line That life must pay to pass,âmy post is there; And in my heart I've that will make me fatal. [Exit. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Palace. Enter Countess of Argyle and Celine. ARGYLE. I dare not look again upon the crowd: Their savage yells, their frightful faces, and Their rage, appal my soulâWhere is the Queen? CELINE. I know not, Lady; for the multitude Within the palace cramm'd the avenues, And, in their eagerness to aid the Queen, Soon severed her from her attendants. ARGYLE. 'Twas so I lost her too. But is there no one Can tell us of her fate? CELINE. Here comes the Signor:â He knows, if any know, where we shall find Our Royal Mistress. Enter Rizzio. RIZZIO. 'Twas but now I left The Queen, to learn some tidings of the fray, Which happily is ended, but I know not, Where, in my absence, she withdrew, ARGYLE. Then, is the danger past? RIZZIO. You hear the shouts no more. ARGYLE. No; all is silent;âWas't the Queen controul'd The riot? or her friends? RIZZIO. Neither. Before She reach'd the balcony, Ruthven was up, And with a bold harangue outbade the storm. CELINE. Thank Heav'n for this good news! ARGYLE. Amen. It may be She's in the chamber now:âlet's seek her there, And be the Messengers of Peace to cheer her. [Exeunt Argyle and Celine. RIZZIO. All's over now with me: yesâI must fly From hence to save the Queen; this tumult proves it. âBut how will foul-mouthed Rumour scan the act; âAnd what will future story say of it?â 'Twas but the other day I met a Beldam, Who fix'd her time-defying eyes upon me, And seemed to read my features by the light Of some strange faculty. I asked her what She saw, and she saidâBlood; then, pointing to The Palace-gate, she charg'd me in the names Of Love and Loyalty to go no more. I started at one wordâthe word was Love, And turning back a few bright leaves of time I read it there, even as the Beldam told me, And saw my guilt reveal'd. âBut was it guilt? âIs madness guilt? Is love that asks for nought âBut pity, guilt? If so, 'tis well revenged, âAnd need not suffer more.ââHow, now, who's there? Enter Garcia. GARCIA. A Friend. RIZZIO. Ha, Garcia! GARCIA. E'en the same, though changed In fortune, and confounded by th' events Around me;âHave you thought, what's to be done? RIZZIO. We must away from Scotland. GARCIA. So, 'tis best. The Bayonne League has raised all hands against us; And now another whisper goes abroad: They say that Ruthven's daughter pines to death. RIZZIO. Indeed! GARCIA. 'Tis so reported. RIZZIO. Go; bid our friends prepare. GARCIA. They wait, concealed, below. RIZZIO. I'll come to you, When I have bade the Queen a last farewell. GARCIA. Nay, come at once.âThe sight of her will lead Your captive senses from the path: beware. RIZZIO. 'Tis now too late;âshe's here:âI prithee leave me. [Exit Garcia. How like what we believe of angels, is What we behold of her! Enter Queen. QUEEN. Rizzio, well met: You've come to wish me joy the tumult's o'er. Is it not so? RIZZIO. From my full heart I wish it. QUEEN. But tell me how did Ruthven speak?âYou heard him. RIZZIO. Like one inspired. The spirit of rebuke Swept thunder from his lips; nay, triumph'd o'er The rheums, that bent his frame;âas if to shew What mind can do with matter, and the fire Of genius with the shell in which it burns:â But I have other news to mix with it, That will not sound so well: the Lady Catherineâ QUEEN. Ah! what of her? RIZZIO. 'Tis feared her death draws nigh. QUEEN. There is an envious malice in the stars, That will not let me smile, but I must weep for 't. RIZZIO. O! may those tears be dried by happier hands Than hers or mine, for we must both away; I've come to take my leave. QUEEN. That's sudden too: Must all I love, then, leave me? RIZZIO. On my knees I bless thee for that word:â'tis balm to grief,â 'Tis life to death,â'tis transport to despair! QUEEN. What have I said? Oh, Rizzio! if I spoke Too strongly what I felt, should youâfarewellâ Be generous, be just; forget it, and Let me forget it. RIZZIO. Ah! recall it not, For fear of me, or what my hopes may claim. If I could cherish even a wish that wrong'd you, These hands should tear this body from this soul, As worthless of its human covering! QUEEN. Enough: I do believe, and pity thee; But yonder comes Argyle:âLeave me at once. RIZZIO. So soon? QUEEN. 'Tis short in act, but in remembrance 'Twill last for ever:âyet, there's something else I would have said. RIZZIO. I'll stay till you recall it. QUEEN. No, no! 'tis fitting you should leave me now; But come again to-night; and yet a voice Of terror seems to echo back my words, As if they were forbidden. RIZZIO. Gracious Queen, let not your fears impede the only glimpse That I shall ever catch of happiness,â You said, to-night! QUEEN. Once more, and that the last,â To-night I'll see thee. [Exit. RIZZIO. Yes, though death himself Stood at the door, I'd brave his worst to enter. [Exit. SCENE II. An Apartment in Ruthven's House. Enter Morton, and other Conspirators. MORTON. The mob went further than 'twas our intent They should have gone; but Ruthven soon recall'd them, And saved appearances. DOUGLAS. 'Twas well-timed vigour:âBut what's the gain, If Rizzio still must lord it O'er King and Nobles?â MORTON. Nay, have patience, George: We've met to fix his fate. DOUGLAS. Where is the King? Where's Ruthven? MORTON. Still, I say, have patience, man. Ruthven, you know, besides his malady, Is troubled for his child; and though he puts A stern face on his grief, it may be seen through. To-day he bit his lips, not knowing what He did, till blood ran from them, and at times You'll hear a smother'd groan, stopping half-way, As if it met some thought of pride, that strove In vain to choke it. MORTON. Said you not, he promised, In case of Rizzio's death, to bind the King To our support by something stronger than His own capricious will? MORTON. He'll keep his promise too. But see, they come together. Welcome to Your Majesty; and Ruthven, welcome home. Enter Darnley and Ruthven. DARNLEY. Now, friends, you see what Scotland's court is come to, And Scotland's King and people! Foreigners Sit in high places: nay, insult us with Impunity, and mock the power they fear not. DOUGLAS. And that Italian dog, the worst amongst 'em, Usurps the very throne. DARNLEY. Our business is, To settle here, what vengeance we shall take. LINDSAY. Could we not still contrive to banish him? RUTHVEN. Ayâbanish him. [Sneeringly. LINDSAY. We've ships enough. MORTON. And goodly fortresses: I've great faith in the virtue of stone walls. CHALMERS. My soul's so eager to be rid of him, And with him all his crew, that either course Will please me well, if it be promptly taken. DOUGLAS. What says Lord Ruthven? RUTHVEN. That my head is pained. MORTON. His heart more likely; 'tis the thought of his Poor child, that sinks him. DOUGLAS. Is't your old complaint? RUTHVEN. Not soâbut there are counsels sicken me As much as that, or more. I hate half measures,â I hate to see a spider spin his entrails To catch a fly. There was a time when men Looked to their own good swords to rid them of Their enemies:âIt worked well, and saved troubleâ But now, simplicity is out of fashion, And crookedness the rage. DARNLEY. Ruthven, my friend, You give the best advice. DeathâDeath alone, And the dark wrapper of eternal night, Can lay his evil spirit low enough. LINDSAY. If 'tis your Majesty's desire, and Ruthven's. DARNLEY. 'Tis mine as well. I'm for the long remove. RUTHVEN. What is't we seek to rid us of? A pair Of hands, and other limbs, endued with motion? If so, let them be tied. But noâ'tis mind,â The subtile power, that, with invisible organs Acting upon the strange events of time, Makes all things possible:âto conquer that, We must extinguish it. LINDSAY. Then be it so. MORTON. Are we agreed? Conspirators. Allâall. RUTHVEN. Naught else remains But that we set to work like men prepared For the world's judgment. We shall have the Queenâ The Queen and her revenge to cope withal. DARNLEY. But I am with you: I am one of you. My sanction's your support. RUTHVEN. On that we build, Sir. Here is a paper, drawn up in the sense [Presents a paper to Darnley. Of such a declaration. Look: it states, That you approve the death of David Rizzio: No more:âsign that, and Rizzio's race is run. You start, Sir; what's the matter? DARNLEY. Would you bind me By such a fastening as was meant to hold The slippery knave to his engagements? Would you Deal with a King, as with a trickster? RUTHVEN. Sir, Our friends are here to answer for themselves. My mind's made up for the security. [Flings the paper on the table. DOUGLAS. And so is mine. All. And ours. RUTHVEN. You hear them, Sir! DARNLEY. Yet give me leaveâI'd speak a word with you Alone. [to Ruthven. RUTHVEN. At your good pleasure, Sir. Pray, leave us, friends; Your cause is safe with me. I'll not be fool'd. [Aside to Conspirators as they go out. DARNLEY. Shut close the door, and let me have your patience. Oh, Ruthven! you have cut me to the soul. Bonds, as the word denotes, are shameful ties: They bind by force and fear; and he who signs one, Confesses to the base necessity. RUTHVEN. I cannot see this nice distinction, Sir,â An oath's a bond,âa promise is a bond,â A simple aye, or any dumb denotementâ Jove's was a nodâare bonds: the writing down Is the preserving process, that defends, And not degrades it. DARNLEY. Ah! dost doubt me, then? RUTHVEN. I love plain language, and am nothing loath To answer to straight-forward questioning In its own spirit. I do doubt you, Sir. DARNLEY. What right have you to doubt a sovereign's word? RUTHVEN. I have a right to doubt an angel's word, When character's at stake. Sir, we're all men,â The palace and the cottage mark our place, But alter not our nature. Minds will change; And circumstance, occasion's common drudge, Assails the strongest of us. If the deed Were doneâI mean, the deed that takes off Rizzio, And you, from any cause, disclaimed your share in 'tâ What would become of us, your instruments? The brand of an appalling infamyâ The name of murdererâif not the fateâ (And the name's worse) would mark the world's opinion. DARNLEY. But if his punishment be due to justice, What signifies the worldâor what it says? RUTHVEN. It signifies the worldâthat's every thingâ If I must spurn opinion, shew me to A cell where I can hide, and slap the grating In the world's face:âBut to defy the world And live in't is impossible! DARNLEY. Will not An oath suffice for your security?â RUTHVEN. Look up into the region of the air! 'Tis almost made of broken promises, Of words and oaths!âYet where's the trace to tell Who made and broke them? Why, compar'd with thisâ And this is the security you'd give me!â The wounded bark is an eternal record:â There's more endurance in the imprinted sand, While waiting for the wave:âSign, and be done. DARNLEY. I'll swear, but cannot sign. RUTHVEN. Good bye to you! DARNLEY. Hold, Ruthven!âWould you leave me? RUTHVEN. Rather than Be made a cat's-paw, Sir, I'd leave the world To kittens and their tricks. The Queen may hold Her revels now, and sit up all night long, With dance, and music, and the flattery Of fools, to keep her wakeful. DARNLEY. You distract me!â Stayâwhere's the paper? RUTHVEN. There, before you, Sir. [Pointing to the table. Remember, when you sign, that Rizzio diesâ The Queen submitsâthe House of Douglas reignsâ These are the issues of that simple act, Which, tracing on the paper but a name, Gives in return a kingdom and revenge. Ha! do you pause? [Darnley hesitates, but at length snatches up the pen, and signs. DARNLEY. Let meâ'tis done, and now I'm in your power. RUTHVEN. Nay, nay, you're flurried, Sir, (taking the paper) Compose yourself. DARNLEY. Yet give me back the scroll:â If after all he's innocent,âor ifâ RUTHVEN. Why look you now, what weakness you betray! One moment raving! and the next repenting! By Heaven! there's more soul in a lighted faggot Than such a man! DARNLEY. Ah, now indeed I feel I'm in your power. RUTHVEN. 'Tis better so, than at The mercy of your own discretion. Yet, be a man; take courage in the thought, That Rizzio's knell is toll'd. DARNLEY. When shall he die? RUTHVEN. Before another morrow. See, the shades Of evening 'gin to draw their misty hoods Around them, and the mountains frown like fate; 'Twill be an awful night, a busy night, A bloody nightâbut Scotland will be free. How now! who knocks? Whate'er thou art, come forth. Seek you the King? Enter Morton, and other Conspirators. MORTON. Ruthven, 'tis you we seek. Your daughterâ RUTHVEN. What of her? my daughter? quick. MORTON. Controul yourself, my friend: be Ruthven still: Her life is ebbing fast; and nothing would Content her, till her maidens brought her here, To beg your parting blessing, ere she die. RUTHVEN. There are some hearts that break: 'tis happy for them. MORTON. [To the other Conspirators. Let's leave them to their melancholy meeting. [Exeunt Conspirators. [As the Conspirators go out, Catherine is borne in. My child, what's this I hear? They talk of deathâ But 'tis their talk. Ah me! you look it too!â Yet looks deceive us oft; and yours will mendâ Smile on me, Kate;âbut smile. CATHERINE. Are we alone? RUTHVEN. Away from all the world. CATHERINE. Then give me your Last blessing, father. RUTHVEN. Not, O! not the last! I'll bless you, as I bless you every night, To do so when the morning wakes again, But not to seal the parting, that's eternal. CATHERINE. The morn will wake again, but not to me: Yet, ere I die, let me entreat one favour. RUTHVEN. Oh Kate, my very soul's at your command, Ask what you will that's not impossible, And live, and take it. CATHERINE. Then, my father, shun, Forego the crime, for which you're leagued with monsters, Made out of men. RUTHVEN. What mean'st thou? CATHERINE. Lookâthis paper (shewing a paper), Knowest thou this paper? RUTHVEN. 'Tis a letter from The Earl of Morton. CATHERINE. Planning Rizzio's death. RUTHVEN. Give it me back. Curse on the luckless chance, That lost it from my keeping! CATHERINE. Rather bless it As I do, if it guide your child to save you; For 'tis salvation in a stronger sense To rescue and prevent a man from murdering, E'en than from being murdered. RUTHVEN. 'Tis not murder. CATHERINE. Not murder! What! to kill the innocent! RUTHVEN. They are not innocent. CATHERINE. They are! they are! But e'en if not, still what have you to do With Heaven's eternal functions? O! this work Of retribution in a human hand! 'Tis havock and not justiceâhelp! I faint. RUTHVEN. (Snatching her in his arms.) Look up, my child! my Kate! 'tis granted, all, Rizzio's safe.âThe Queen is pureâthe world May revel, till it rot, ere I complain, So thou'lt but give me back the life I live in More than my own. CATHERINE. I cannot: my strength failsâ My heart is stoppedâOh Father! [dies. RUTHVEN. Speak again! She's dead!âis death so short a ceremony?â 'Tis but one pangâone moment's deeper faintâ And nothing more. Kate! do you hear me, Kate? Not all the air that floats 'twixt this and Heaven, Can lend her one short breath; no, not so much As would make up a sigh to answer me. Ha! Morton! Enter Morton. MORTON. Come, my friend, this is no place For you to linger in. You must part. RUTHVEN. I know it. There's one was here before you, who has parted us, And far enough. MORTON. Nay, you must go from hence. Gaze not upon the dead: 'twill but distract you. RUTHVEN. I had a dream last night, that told me all. MORTON. Dismiss, forget it nowâhis mind's unsettled. RUTHVEN. Methought I saw the lonely power of death, With his pale crown, sitting upon a Throne Of ruin;âThough he had more subjects than The living world contains, they were to him As nothingâfor his attributes were nothing; And his strange lifeâthe life of deathâwas nothing. Methought I saw the lonely Potentate, Upon his breathless bosom lay his hand, And then a thrill ran through my frame, which told me I had passed under his dominion. MORTON. It shakes your soul too much to think of it. RUTHVEN. Next came the horrid chill of night and darkness, That, like an ugly monster, swallowed up The shape of things. Motion was at an end, And formâThe winds were hushed, the sea was mute, The sky was voiceless, and the Earth itself As silent as the moon. I strove to shake The stupor from my senses, and at length Burst the fell bondage of the grisly King,â I woke, but O, to what reality? Let me not think on't. Noâshe's gone, and fate Has done its worst!âThere's comfort in that worst. Proud scorn and fierce defiance are the passions It sends to fight with lamentation,â There is no terror now for me in things Most terrible!âI love to see the storm Shake from its fiery lap the seeds of death Upon the wind, and rush from Heaven to Hell!â I love to see the high wave dash the orbs Of light, and feel the earth shake under me, When ruin pelts it with the driving blast, And plays the devil in the hurricane! MORTON. O, come, my friend! RUTHVEN. Lead where you willâI care not. [Exeunt. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Palace. Enter Queen, and Countess of Argyle. QUEEN. Lord Ruthven, to request an interview! What can his purpose be? ARGYLE. Mayhap to speak Of his bereavement. QUEEN. No; he's not a man To care for sympathy: more like he comes To bend my resolution to the King: But he may spare his pains, if that's his missionâ Go, Countessâwait withoutâhe's coming hither. [Argyle exit, as Ruthven enters. My Lord of Ruthven, I am sorry for Your trouble, which is shared by many here. RUTHVEN. Thanks to your Majestyâ'Twas hard upon me, For I had nature's passport to precedence; But death's no courtier. To the purpose, thoughâ Before my daughter died, she charged me with A last request, that in its spirit led To this our meetingâI would heal the breach That severs, as it were, the throne in two; 'Tis like the cleaving of the head of empire, Destructive in its certain consequence. QUEEN. Whate'er the consequence, the King's to blame. RUTHVEN. No, Madam, Rizzio is to blameâthe King Would banish him: your Majesty protects him; And, for a slaveâa wretch not worth a thoughtâ This mighty State is threatened with destruction, If neither will give way. QUEEN. And if one should, You think it ought to be the Queen?âMy Lord, In that our politics agree not. RUTHVEN. Yet, There's no disgrace in drawing back a step That rashly was put forward. QUEEN. Rashly, Sir! RUTHVEN. Your pardon, Madam; if I may not speak Out plainly, I had better hold my tongue. Was it not rash to take the part of any man Against the King, your husband? QUEEN. Darest thou then, Presume, as he presumed, to talk of guilt? RUTHVEN. No, Madam; not of guilt in its full meaning: But there's a sort of guilt in innocence, And weakness is its name. You are bewitched By this curst sorcerer. What is this Rizzio, That you should throw before him as a shield, Your reputation? Or, is reputation So light a thing? If 'tis not virtue's self, It is the outward form we know it by, And we should love it dearer than our own, For virtue's sakeâMadam, the world condemns you. QUEEN. You and your friends? RUTHVEN. I and the rest of men. We say that Rizzio is an evil spirit Haunting your matron bosom. Scotland hates him: Your husband hates him: you, if you had eyes To see what deep affliction springs from weakness, Would shun him, banish him, be rid of him; And if you could not hate himself, would hate His sight, like infamy: there's ruin in't, And scandal, and remorse, and scorn, and shame. Upon my knees I pray your Majesty, Spurn not my words, because the words are mine; But lay them to your heart; and let them speak To the inward monitor. QUEEN. Am I thus fallen To be rebuked and lectured like a criminal? But I'll not weepânoâare you not ashamed, Old man, to take the part of cruelty Against the unoffending and the weak? Rizzio has done no wrong, and therefore he Shall suffer none. RUTHVEN. Then I've no more to say. My business was But to acquit my conscience and my heart To her who is no more.âMadam, you've sealed The fate of Rizzio. QUEEN. Ha! What say'st thou? Dare To raise a finger in the way of harm 'Gainst him or any whom the Queen protects, And you shall find that vengeance does not sleep, But for refreshment. Tell the King of this, And try your strength combined to alter it. [Exit. RUTHVEN. We'll take you at your word, imperious woman, And sooner than you dream of. Enter Darnley and Conspirators. Welcome, Sir! And you, my friendsâwelcome to each. You're come In time to find me all your own. The Queen Is bent on Rizzio's stay. DARNLEY. I told you soâ You've done with scruples now, I hope? RUTHVEN. For ever. DARNLEY. Then let us settle on the final plan. Morton has just relieved the guard, whose charge Is filled by others in our confidence. MORTON. But is it certain Rizzio sups to-night In the Queen's closet with the Queen? DOUGLAS. For certain He does intend it. CHALMERS. Shall we seize him as He passes through the court-yard, and dispatch him? DARNLEY. Not so; the Queen, who shared his crime, should share His punishment. Let's watch him to her closet, And there, before her face, inflict the blow. DOUGLAS. And let there be no shrinking when we come to't. If he should 'scape, my mother in her grave Would give a sullen groan. The villain daredâ RUTHVEN. Hush! the man's dead. DOUGLAS. Dead! RUTHVEN. Ay, in destiny Already dead, if we're all men, or any of us. MORTON. Is every thing prepared? DOUGLAS. Ripe for the blow. MORTON. George Douglas, be't your task to keep an eye Upon his movements, till he's safely lodged, And then to bring us word. DOUGLAS. Depend upon't I'll not lose sight of him. DARNLEY. Ruthven, you droopâ Nay, rouse yourself!âRemember, you're our leader. RUTHVEN. I do. DARNLEY. But are you sure that your late loss Hath left no drop of weakness after it, Which, at the moment, may unnerve your hand? RUTHVEN. You've heard the story of a lioness That saw her young whelp by the hunter speared One glorious day of chase. Furious she sprang From the thick jungle at the multitude, And made more havoc in their ranks than wildfire In brambles, till she fell. Nor quailed she then; For when she fell, 'twas at the bleeding side Of her own offspring stretched in death. Close, close As mothers lie, she lay to 't; stroked the skin By hunters rudely torn, and with a lick, Which was her kiss, pierced by a hundred wounds, Amidst a thousand shouts, she died lamenting The baby brute that from her fearful breast Drew milk and tenderness. Such as that mother, Am I a father. Such the grief I feel. Come, follow me, and you shall own its greatness. [Exeunt all but Douglas and Chalmers. DOUGLAS. Stay, Chalmers;âa man likes to have a comrade Upon the watch. CHALMERS. We've watched together, George, Before to-night, but not in such a camp. Well; Scotland must be saved. DOUGLAS. Look! is that he? CHALMERS. 'Tis he and his friend Garcia. DOUGLAS. This way!âthis way! They must not find us here at such an hour. [They conceal themselves. Enter Rizzio, and Garcia. GARCIA. I knew how 't would be when you met the Queen;â But is't not rash to venture now again. The ship is ready, and your friends are waitingâ All are embarked: they look impatient for Your coming, to set sail. RIZZIO. Whatâshould I break My promise? GARCIA. Should you risk your life, and those Of others, who depend on you? RIZZIO. Nay, nay; We're not in Turkey, amongst infidels, âThat we should dread the bow-string.â GARCIA. But we're in A land of enemies; and when a Christian Turns Devil, âhe's a match for any Mussulman.â RIZZIO. Out, out! you let your terrors chill your manhood. I have engaged to play a requiem For the departed soul of that sweet maid, Whose love you charge me with. My harp is in The closet now, and only waits my hand. GARCIA. Well, if you must, I wish you wellâthat's all; For, more than wish it is impossible. [Exit. RIZZIO. How awful is this midnight sleep and silence! The lamps burn dimly in the corridor; The wind sighs mournful through the empty rooms Of state, like wisdom whispering vanity, And all the flaunting plumes that waved aloft, Like sea foam, on the billows of the main, Are, with the wearers, vanished. So it is With life; yet, let me while I may, enjoyâ Yonder's the door that in its keeping holds The richest treasure of the bounteous earth;â I'll bless my senses with the sight of it. [Exit. Re-enter Douglas. DOUGLAS (speaking to CHALMERS). Go, Chalmers; follow Garcia; seize him, lest He cause some interruption to our course. Ha, the door opens! Rizzio enters, and [Chalmers exit. It closes after him! He's safe within! I've tracked him into covertânow for the hunters! [Exit. SCENE II. The Queen's Closet. The Queen and Countess of Argyle seated at table. Rizzio at the harp. RIZZIO sings. When the dead sleep 'Tis weakness to weep; Their sorrows are past, And the hope that will last, Is that which looks over the Earth's narrow sphere, For the summer is there, but the winter is here. âWhen the dead rise âFrom earth to the skies, âSubdued is the night âBy the angel of light, âAnd banished for ever's mortality's tear, âFor the summer is there, but the winter is here.â QUEEN. Thanks, Rizzio, for this sweetly plaintive strain. Which haply we shall never hear beyond The echoes of this night. Why do you rise? RIZZIO. O! Madam, I am sick with melancholy, Dark thoughts of death, and parting, worse than death, Fall on my heart, like shadows on a tomb. âI'll gaze upon this outward scene awhile, âAnd think myself a spirit in yon sky, [Going to the window. âAnd so forget the grief that troubles me. âLook up, sweet Queen, and see with what a smile âThe current of the night runs on to morn. âWhat is this wondrous universe, in midst âOf which we seem to stand?âWhat are those orbs, âAnd this surrounding sky, so richly wrought âWith gold, and painted with Heaven's light?âis this âA frame to set so poor a picture in, âAs man? If so, there are, there must be, in him âGreat seeds, that shoot above the size of time; âImmortal faculties, that grow for ever: âYes, even the breaking of the day-light sheds âA revelation on his destiny.â ARGYLE. The wine cup, Signor, has a charm, they say, To lift up sinking hearts; taste, taste, and try; And if you'd have a name to grace the act, Drink to the Queen. [Gives a cup. RIZZIO. The Queen! (drinks.) I feel refreshed. No wonder wretchedness should fly to thee, Thou bold artificer of unmade fortunes, That spurn'st the dull routine events are chained in, Laugh'st in the face of half-relenting truth, And mak'st the slave a king. I feel thy power, And thus I use the strength it girds me with, To kneel where every heart should pay devotion, And worship virtue's self in beauty's form. [Kneels to the Queen. QUEEN. Nay, rise, and mock me not with praise: thy speech Would better suit an angel's excellence. RIZZIO. Then what art thou, bright vision of my soul, That look'st as heaven were here? Ah! must I go From hence, for ever into banishment? O Queen! I'm punished, and I well deserve it; For let me now confess I have deceived Myself and thee:âI was the willing dupe Of mine own artifice. 'Twas love alone That, covered with the name of gratitude, Lurk'd in my treacherous heart. QUEEN. Why have you told A secret that should never see the light? RIZZIO. Because I have not e'en the virtue to Conceal it. Seeing how you pitied me, And, in your gracious favour, took my part, I saw my crime, but saw not to correct it. E'en now, I cannot, must not, will not leave thee, Though death and ruin be my portion here. QUEEN. O Rizzio! when too late, I see my own Rash conduct too; I've been to blame for much Of this distress and error: I have acted Lightly, not guiltily; but guilt and shame Have small beginnings both: 'tis hell's device To plunge it's victim into hopeless crime. [A noise outsideâthey all start. What sound was that? ARGYLE. It was an awful sound: I'll seek to find the cause. [Exit. QUEEN. Rizzio, if aught Of ill should fall on thee, for my sake, how Could I support it? RIZZIO. Be not downcast, Madam. We're in your palace, and your palace is The seat of your security, where all Your crowned ancestors have kept their state: Their memories are like ethereal guards, And, with a charge from Heaven, they banish insult. QUEEN. Still, still, a sad foreboding shakes my soulâ The hour, the previous silence, and that sound! The shudder of an earthquake seemed to follow it. [Countess of Argyle rushes in, and throws herself at the Queen's feet. How now, Argyle! What means that look of fright? Speak out at onceâsay something, or do something To snatch us from our fear. ARGYLE. O Madam! madam! When I have breath, I'll tell youâThere's some evil On foot within the palace. QUEEN. What? from whom? Have you seen aught that showed this horror to you? ARGYLE. I have;âin th' outward porch, I saw a group Of men, all armed:âthe King, the King, was with 'em. RIZZIO. Then, 'tis my life they seek! QUEEN. But hear her! hear her! ARGYLE. Amongst the rest, was Ruthven, clad in steel. Hark! 'twas the crash of armour. [A crash is heard. QUEEN. No; 'twas but The wind; secure the doorâbolt it. ARGYLE. 'Tis fast. [They secure the door. RIZZIO. I hear the sound of footsteps. QUEEN. Heavenly powers! O Rizzio, fear not: still the Queen protects thee. RIZZIO. The sound comes still! QUEEN. What's to be done? Yon windowâ O no; the height's too great. Oh, powers of Heaven! Ye, ye alone, can shield usâsave us! [The tapestry which covers a secret door is raised, and Ruthven appears in armour at the head of the Conspiratorsâexcept Morton. QUEEN. (shrieks.) Ah! [rushing down with Rizzio and Argyle. Pale warrior, com'st thou from the realm unknown, A semblance only of the man thou wast; But art no longer? or is't life we see, So like to death that we are horrified? Speak to me;âwilt not speak?âthen, Darnley, tell me What are these men; why are they here in arms? Are these companions for a lady's chamber, Or suit they with a Queen's? DARNLEY. They better suit it Than one I here behold, standing behind thee. RUTHVEN. Rizzio, come forth! QUEEN. 'Tis Ruthven speaks at last, And murder sounds in every frightful tone. Ho! there!âCall in the guard! DARNLEY. The guard is here. QUEEN. What! are my faithful sentinels exchanged For such as these, whose watch is like the wolf's, Not for defence, but for aggression? RUTHVEN. Madam, I did not mean to speak: I came to act; But as your Majesty will have it otherwise, I must obey the call. You see before you A living man, but dying as he lives; A dying man, but living to perform An act of cold and calm severity, By justice self imposed. Nay, madam, frown not, Nor think to look me down. I have no fear; Or if I had, I've nothing now to fear for. Old, desolate, and childless, here I standâ I am not of your kind, nor of your clan, Nor of your world; but dead alike to all;â Yet I've a sense of what I owe my country, And that hath brought me, lock'd in martial mail, Against whose iron ribs your words are dash'd, In striking at my heart. (Thunder.) Hark! 'tis Heaven's voice Which says this hour must end the guilty joys Of Holyrood for ever. QUEEN. Darnley, are you A husband or a King?âa peasant's wife Would not have need to ask for vengeance, if She suffered such an insult in his presence! RIZZIO. The Queen is innocent, and I'm defenceless. Look! I'm unarmed, and you are cased in steel: I'm one, and you are many: spare me, therefore. RUTHVEN. Rizzio, come forth!âtoo long have you disgraced That place, poisoning the ear of Majesty. Rizzio, come forth! Let go the Queen's robe, caitiff. Thus then, with the last effort of a hand That once might pluck the giant from his bed, Or heap, like Jove, th' eternal mountains on him, I drag thee to thy fate. [As he rushes towards Rizzio the Queen interposes. QUEEN. Hold off! hold off Thy hand from the thrice blessed life of man! Strike not the great Creator in his image! RUTHVEN. There is a freezing horror in your wordsâ But justice must be doneâaway with him! [Flings Rizzio amongst the Conspirators, who drag him off the stageâRuthven following. QUEEN. Murder!âthey'll shed his blood! his guiltless blood! Will no one save him from these savages? Oh Heaven! 'tis on thy mercy that I call For vengeance! O, be merciful, and kill These killers! [Enter Melville from folding doors. Now, good Melville, is there hope? MELVILLE. Madamâ QUEEN. Speak! speak! is he alive or dead? MELVILLE. He's past the reach of help or injuryâ Ha! look to the Queen! she faints! [He rushes towards her. QUEEN. No; no more faintingâ Ruthven again! How's this?âHe glares more like A wounded tiger than a dying man. [Ruthven totters in, and sinks on a couch. RUTHVEN. Fetch me a cup of wine. QUEEN. Out, blood-stained monster! Nor dare to ask for aught. Fetch him a cup Of fire, that he may drink as demons drink, For he is one. [The Queen faints. RUTHVEN. I feel as if I lack'd The strength to die. Will no one help me to't? MELVILLE. Here's wine. [Gives him a cup. RUTHVEN. Thanks! thanks! there's vigour in the draught. Where am I?âWine!âmore wine! How dark it is! Midnight is not so dark. The stars have dropped Into the Nadyr, and the Zenyth thunders Like an uplifted hell-storm o'er my head. Hush! there's a voice upon the wind.âWho spoke? Who said the heavens are wrathful at the deed? Who dared to breathe that Ruthven is a murderer? For Scotlandâ'Twas for Scotlandâfor our country. Attest it, powers above, we struck for rightâ For right.â'Tis doomsday with mankind,â The pillars of the sky are tumblingâ And all created nature feels the shock Of the main works above. Rage on, rage onâ Ye dreadful sweepings of the thunder store; Scatter me, bones and all, to the wind's fury. Still I repeat, it was a rightful blow. 'Twas for our Country! 'Twasâ'twas for our Country! [dies. THE END.</field>
