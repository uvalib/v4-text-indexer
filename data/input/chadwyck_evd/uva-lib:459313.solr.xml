      <field name="fulltext">Tamburlaine the Great</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. From iygging vaines of riming mother wits, And such conceits as clownage keepes in pay, Weele lead you to the stately tent of War. Where you shall heare the Scythian Tamburlaine: Threatning the world with high astounding tearms And scourging kingdoms with his c?quering sword View but his picture in this tragicke glasse, And then applaud his fortunes as you please.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus. 1. ScÃ¦na. I. Mycetes, Cosroe, Meander, Theridamas, Ortygius, Ceneus, with others. Mycetes. Brother Cosroe, I find my selfe agreeu'd, Yet insufficient to expresse the same: For it requires a great and thundring speech: Good brother tell the cause vnto my Lords, I know you haue a better wit than I. Cos. Unhappie Persea, that in former age Hast bene the seat of mightie Conquerors, That in their prowesse and their pollicies, Haue triumpht ouer Affrike, and the bounds Of Europe, wher the Sun dares scarce appeare, For freezing meteors and coniealed colde: Now to be rulde and gouerned by a man, At whose byrth-day Cynthia with Saturne ioinde, And Ioue, the Sun and Mercurie denied To shed his influence in his fickle braine, Now Turkes and Tartars shake their swords at thee Meaning to mangle all thy Prouinces, Mycet. Brother, I see your meaning well enough, And thorough your Planets I perceiue you thinke, I am not wise enough to be a kinge, But I refer me to my noble men, That knowe my wit, and can be witnesses: I might command you to be slaine for this, Meander, might I not? Meand. Not for so small a fault my soueraigne Lord Mycet. I meane it not, but yet I know I might, Yet liue, yea, liue, Mycetes wils it so: Meander, thou my faithfull Counsellor, Declare the cause of my conceiued griefe, Which is (God knowes) about that Tamburlaine, That like a Foxe in midst of haruest time, Dooth pray vpnon my flockes of Passengers. And as I heare, doth meane to pull my plumes, Therefore tis good and meete for to be wise. Meand. Oft haue I heard your Maiestie complain, Of Tamburlaine, that sturdie Scythian thiefe, That robs your merchants of Persepolis, Treading by land vnto the Westerne Isles, And in your confines with his lawlesse traine, Daily commits inciuill outrages. Hoping (misled by dreaming prophesies) To raigne in Asia, and with barbarous Armes, To make himselfe the Monarch of the East: But ere he march in Asia, or display His vagrant Ensigne in the Persean fields, Your Grace hath taken order by Theridimas, Chardg'd with a thousand horse, to apprehend And bring him Captiue to your Highnesse throne, Myce. Ful true thou speakst, &amp; like thy selfe my lord Whom I may tearme a Damon for thy loue. Therefore tis best, if so it lik you all, To send my thousand horse incontinent, To apprehend that paltrie Scythian. How like you this, my honorable Lords? Is it not a kingly resolution? Cosr. It cannot choose, because it comes from you. Myce. Then heare thy charge, valiant Theridimas The chiefest Captaine of Mycetes hoste, The hope of Persea, and the verie legges Whereon our state both leane, as on a staffe, That holds vs vp, and foiles our neighbour foes. Thou shalt be leader of this thousand horse, Whose foming galle with rage and high disdaine, Haue sworne the death of wicked Tamburlaine. Go frowning foorth, but come thou smyling home, As did Sir Paris with the Grecian Dame, Returne with speed, time passeth swift away, Our life is fraile, and we may die to day. Ther. Before the Moone renew her borrowed light, Doubt not my Lord and gratious Soueraigne, But Tamburlaine, and that Tartarian rout, Shall either perish by our warlike hands, Or plead for mercie at your highnesse feet. Myce. Go, stout Theridimas, thy words are swords And with thy lookes thou conquerest all thy foes: I long to see thee backe returne from thence, That I may view these milk-white steeds of mine. All loden with the heads of killed men, And from their knees, euen to their hoofes below, Besmer'd with blood, that makes a dainty show. The. Then now my Lord, I humbly take my leaue. Exit. Myc. Therid. farewel ten thousand times, Ah, Menaphon, why staiest thou thus behind, When other men prease forward for renowne: Go Menaphon, go into Scythia, And foot by foot follow Theridamas: Cos. Nay, pray you let him stay, a greater Fits Menaphon, than warring with a Thiefe: Create him Prorex of Affrica, That he may win the Babylonians hearts, Which will reuolt from Persean gouernment, Unlesse they haue a wiser king than you. Myc. Unlesse they haue a wiser king than you? These are his words, Meander set them downe. Cos. And ad this to them, that all Asia Lament to see the follie of their King. Myc. Well here I sweare by this my royal seat. Cos. You may doe well to kisse it then. Myc. Embost with silke as best beseemes my state, To be reueng'd for these contemptuous words. O where is dutie and allegeance now? Fled to the Caspean or the Ocean maine? What, shall I call thee brother? No, a foe, Monster of Nature, shame vnto thy stocke, That dar st presume thy Soueraigne for to mocke. Meander come, I am abus'd Meander. Exit. Manent Cosroe &amp; Menaphon. Mena. How now my Lord, what, mated and amaz'd To heare the king thus thraten like himselfe? Cos. Ah Menaphon, I passe not for his threates, The plot is laid by Persean Noble men, And Captaines of the Medean garrisons, To crowne me Emperour of Asia, But this it is that doth excruciate The verie substance of my vexed soule: To see our neighbours that were woont to quake And tremble at the Persean Monarkes name, Now sits and laughs our regiment to scorne, And that which might resolue me into teares: Men from the farthest Equinoctiall line, Haue swarm'd in troopes into the Easterne India: Lading their shippes with golde and pretious stones: And made their spoiles from all our prouinces. Mena. This should intreat your highnesse to reioice, Since Fortune giues you opportunity, To gaine the tytle of a Conquerour, By curing of this mained Emperie, Affrike and Europe bordering on your land, And continent to your Dominions: How easely may you with a mightie hoste, Passe into GrÃ¦cia, as did Cyrus once. And cause them to withdraw their forces home, Least you subdue the pride of Christendome.? Cos. But Menaph. what means thistrumpets sound Mena. Behold, my Lord Ortigius, and the rest, Bringing the Crowne to make you Emperour. Enter Ortigius &amp; Conerus bearing a Crowne with others. Ort. Magnificent and mightie Prince Cosroe, We in the name of other Persean states, And commons of this mightie Monarchie, Present thee with th'Emperiall Diadem. Cene. The warlike Souldiers, &amp; the Gentlemen, That heretofore haue fild Persepolis With Affrike Captaines, taken in the field: Whose ransome made them martch in coates of gold, With costlie iewels hanging at their eares, And shining stones vpon their loftie Crestes, Now liuing idle in the walled townes, Wanting both pay and martiall discipline. Begin in troopes to threaten ciuill warre. And openly exclaime against the King. Therefore to stay all sodaine mutinies, We will inuest your Highnesse Emperour: Whereat the Souldiers will conceiue more ioy, Then did the Macedonians at the spoile Of great Darius and his wealthy hoast. Cosr. Wel, since I see the state of Persea droope, And languish in my brothers gouernment: I willingly receiue th'mperiall crowne, And vow to weare it for my countries good: In spight of them shall malice my estate. Ortyg. And in assurance of desir'd successe, We here doo crowne thee Monarch of the East, Emperour of Asia, and of Persea, Great Lord of Medea and Armenia: Duke of Affrica and Albania, Mesopotamia and of Parthia, East India and the late discouered Isles, Chiefe Lord of all the wide vast Euxine sea, And of the euer raging Caspian Lake: Long liue Cosroe mighty Emperour. Cosr. And Ioue may neuer let me longer liue, Then I may seeke to gratifie your loue, And cause the souldiers that thus honour me, To triumph ouer many Prouinces. By whose desires of discipline in Armes, I doubt not shortly but to raigne sole king, And with the Armie of Theridamas, Whether we presently will flie (my Lords) To rest secure against my brothers force. Ortyg We knew my Lord, before we brought the crowne, Intending your inuestion so neere, The residence of your dispised brother, The Lord would not be too exasperate, To iniure or suppresse your woorthy tytle. Or if they would, there are in readines Ten thousand horse to carie you from hence, In spite of all suspected enemies. Cosr. I know it wel my Lord, &amp; thanke you all. Ortyg. Sound vp the trumpets then, God saue the King. Exeunt. ScÅna. 2: Tamburlaine leading Zenocrate: Techelles, Vsumeasane, other Lords and Souldiers loden with treasure. Tam. Come lady, let not this appal your thoughts The iewels and the treasure we haue tane Shall be reseru'd, and you in better state, Than if you were arriu'd in Siria. Euen in the circle of your Fathers armes: The mightie Souldan of Egyptia. Zeno. Ah Shepheard, pity my distressed plight, (If as thou seem'st, thou art so meane a man) And seeke not to inrich thy followers, By lawlesse rapine from a silly maide. Who traueiling with these Medean Lords To Memphis, from my vncles country of Medea, Where all my youth I haue bene gouerned, Haue past the armie of the mightie Turke: Bearing his priuie signet and his hand: To safe conduct vs thorow Affrica: Mag. And since we haue arriu'd in Scythia, Besides rich presents from the puisant Cham, We haue his highnesse letters to command Aide and assistance if we stand in need. Tam. But now you see these letters &amp; commandes, Are countermanded by a greater man: And through my prouinces you must expect Letters of conduct from my mightinesse, If you intend to keep your treasure safe. But since I loue to liue at liberty, As easely may you get the Souldans crowne, As any prizes out of my precinct. For they are friends that help to weane my state, Till men and kingdomes help to strengthen it: And must maintaine my life exempt from seruitude. But tell me Maddam, is your grace betroth'd? Zen. I am (my Lord,) for so you do import. Tam. I am a Lord, for so my deeds shall prooue, And yet a shepheard by my Parentage: But Lady, this faire face and heauenly hew, Must grace his bed that conquers Asia: And meanes to be a terrour to the world, Measuring the limits of his Emperie By East and west, as PhÃ¦bus doth his course: Lie here ye weedes that I disdaine to weare, This compleat armor, and this curtle-axe Are adiuncts more beseeming Tamburlaine. And Maddam, whatsoeuer you esteeme Of this successe, and losse vnvallued, Both may inuest you Empresse of the East: And these that seeme but silly country Swaines, May haue the leading of so great an host, As with their waight shall make the mountains quake. Euen as when windy exhalations, Fighting for passage, tilt within the earth. Tec. As princely Lions when they rouse themselues, Stretching their pawes, and threatning heardes of Beastes. So in his Armour looketh Tamburlaine: Me thinks I see kings kneeling at his feet, And he with frowning browes and fiery lookes, Spurning their crownes from off their captiue heads. Vsum. And making thee and me Techelles, kinges, That euen to death will follow Tamburlaine. Tam. Nobly resolu'd, sweet friends and followers, These Lords (perhaps) do scorne our estimates: And thinke we prattle with distempered spirits, But since they measure our deserts so meane, That in conceit bear Empires on our speares, Affecting thoughts coequall with the cloudes, They shall be kept our forced followers, Till with their eies thee view vs Emperours. Zen. The Gods, defenders of the innocent, Will neuer prosper your intended driftes, That thus oppresse poore friendles passengers. Therefore at least admit vs libertie, Euen as thou hop'st to be eternized, By liuing Asias mightie Emperour. Agid. I hope our Ladies treasure and our owne, May serue for ransome to our liberties: Returne our Mules and emptie Camels backe, That we may traueile into Siria, Where her betrothed Lord Alcidamus, Expects th'arriuall of her highnesse person. Mag. And wheresoeuer we repose our selues, We will report but well of Tamburlaine. Tamb. Disdaines Zenocrate to liue with me? Or you my Lordes to be my followers? Thinke you I way this treasure more than you? Not all the Gold in Indias welthy armes, Shall buy the meanest souldier in my traine. Zenocrate, louelier than the Loue of Ioue, Brighter than is the siluer Rhodolfe, Fairer than whitest snow on Scythian hils, Thy person is more woorth to Tamburlaine, Than the possession of the Persean Crowne. Which gratious starres haue promist at my birth, A hundreth Tartars shall attend on thee, Mounted on Steeds, swifter than Pegasus. Thy Garments shall be made of Medean silke, Enchast with precious iuelles of mine owne: More rich and valurous than Zenocrates. With milke-white Hartes vpon an Iuorie sled, Thou shalt be drawen amidst the frosen Pooles, And scale the ysie mountaines lofty tops: Which with thy beautie will be soone resolu'd. My martiall prises with fiue hundred men, Wun on the fiftie headed Vuolgas waues, Shall all we offer to Zenocrate, And then my selfe to faire Zenocrate. Tech. What now? In loue? Tam. Techelles, women must be flatered. But this is she with whom I am in loue. Enter a Souldier. Sould. Newes, newes. Tamb. How now, what's the matter? Sould. A thousand Persean horsmen are at hand, Sent from the King to ouercome vs all. Tam. How now my Lords of Egypt &amp; Zenocrate? Now must your iewels be restor'd againe: And I that triumpht so be ouercome. How say you Lordings, Is not this your hope? Agid. We hope your selfe wil willingly restore th?. Tamb. Such hope, such fortune haue the thousand horse. Soft ye my Lords and sweet Zenocrate. You must be forced from me ere you goe: A thousand horsmen? We fiue hundred foote? An ods too great, for vs to stand against: But are they rich? And is their armour good? Sould. Their plumed helmes are wrought with beaten golde. Their swords enameld, and about their neckes Hangs massie chaines of golde downe to the waste, In euery part exceeding braue and rich. Tam. Then shall we fight couragiously with them, Or looke you, I should play the Orator? Tech. No: cowards and fainthearted runawaies, Looke for orations when the foe is neere. Our swordes shall play the Orators for vs. Vsum. Come let vs meet them at the mountain foot, And with a sodaine and an hot alarme Driue all their horses headlong down the hill. Tech. Come let vs martch. Tam. Stay Techelles, aske a parlee first, The Souldiers enter. Open the Males, yet guard the treasure sure, Lay out our golden wedges to the view, That their reflexions may amaze the Perseans. And looke we friendly on them when they come: But if they offer word or violence, Weele fight fiue hundred men at armes to one, Before we part with our possession. And gainst the Generall we will lift our swords. And either lanch his greedy thirsting throat, Or take him prisoner, and his chaine shall serue For Manackles, till he be ransom'd home. Tech. I heare them come, shal we encounter them? Tam. Keep all your standings, and not stir a foote, My selfe will bide the danger of the brunt. Enter Theridamas with others. Ther. Where is this Scythian Tamberlaine? Tam. Wh? seekst thou Persean? I am Taburlain. Ther. Tamburlaine? A Scythian Shepheard, so imbellished With Natures pride, and richest furniture, His looks do menace heauen and dare the Gods, His fierie eies are fixt vpon the earth. As if he now deuis'd some Stratageme: Or meant to pierce Auernas darksome vaults. To pull the triple headed dog from hell. tamb. Noble and milde this Perseau seemes to be, If outward habit iudge the inward man, tech. His deep affections make him passionate. tamb. With what a maiesty he rears his looks: In thee (thou valiant man of Persea) I see the folly of thy Emperour: Art thou but Captaine of a thousand horse, That by Characters grauen in thy browes, And by thy martiall face and stout aspect, Deseru'st to haue the leading of an hoste? Forsake thy king and do but ioine with me And we will triumph ouer all the world. I hold the Fates bound fast in yron chaines, And with my hand turne Fortunes wheel about, And sooner shall the Sun fall from his Spheare, Than Tamburlaine be slaine or ouercome. Draw foorth thy sword, thou mighty man at Armes, Intending but to rase my charmed skin: And Ioue himselfe will stretch his hand from heauen, To ward the blow, and shield me safe from harme, See how he raines down heaps of gold in showers, As if he meant to giue my Souldiers pay, And as a sure and grounded argument, That I shall be the Monark of the East. He sends this Souldans daughter rich and braue, To be my Queen and portly Emperesse, If thou wilt stay with me, renowmed man, And lead thy thousand horse with my conduct, Besides thy share of this Egyptian prise, Those thousand horse shall sweat with martiall spoile Of conquered kingdomes, and of Cities sackt, Both we wil walke vpon the lofty clifts, And Christian Merchants that with Russian stems Plow vp huge furrowes in the Caspian sea. Shall vaile to vs, as Lords of all the Lake. Both we will raigne as Consuls of the earth, And mightie kings shall be our Senators, Ioue sometime masked in a Shepheards weed, And by those steps that he hath scal'd the heauens, May we become immortall like the Gods. Ioine with me now in this my meane estate, (I cal it meane, because being yet obscure, The Nations far remoou'd admyre me not) And when my name and honor shall be spread, As far as Boreas claps his brazen wings, Or faire BotÃ«es sends his cheerefull light. Then shalt thou be Competitor with me, And sit with Tamburlaine in all his maiestie. Ther. Not Hermes Prolocutor to the Gods, Could vse perswasions more patheticall. Tam. Nor are Apollos Oracles more true, Then thou shalt find my vaunts substantiall. Tec. We are his friends, and if the Persean king Should offer present Dukedomes to our state, We thinke it losse to make exchange for that, We are assured of by our friends successe. Vsum. And kingdomes at the least we all expect. Besides the honor in assured conquestes: Where kings shall crouch vnto our conquering swords, And hostes of souldiers stand amaz'd at vs, When with their fearfull tongues they shall confesse Theise are the men that all the world admires, Ther. What stronge enchantments tice my yeelding soule Are these resolued noble Scythians? But shall I prooue a Traitor to my King? Tam. No, but the trustie friend of Tamburlaine. Ther. Won with thy words, &amp; conquered with thy looks, I yeeld my selfe, my men &amp; horse to thee: To be partaker of thy good or ill, As long as life maintaines Theridamas. Tam. Theridamas my friend, take here my hand. Which is as much as if I swore by heauen, And call'd the Gods to witnesse of my vow, Thus shall my heart be still combinde with thine, Untill our bodies turne to Elements: And both our soules aspire celestiall thrones. Techelles, and Casane, welcome him. Tech. Welcome renowmed Persean to vs all. Cas. Long may theridamas remaine with vs. Tam. These are my friends in wh? I more reioice, Than dooth the King of Persea in his Crowne: And by the loue of Pyllades and Orestes, Whose statutes we adore in Scythia, Thy selfe and them shall neuer part from me, Before I crowne you kings in Asia. Make much of them gentle Theridamas, And they will neuer leaue thee till the death. ther. Nor thee, nor them, thrice noble Tamburlain Shal want my heart to be with gladnes pierc'd To do you honor and securitie. Tam. A thousand thankes worthy theridamas: And now faire Madam, and my noble Lords, If you will willingly remaine with me, You shall haue honors, as your merits be: Or els you shall be forc'd with slauerie. Agid. We yeeld vnto thee happie Tamburlaine. tamb. For you then Maddam, I am out of doubt Zeno. I must be pleasde perforce, wretched Zenocrate. Exeunt.</field>

Mena. Of stature tall, and straightly fashioned, Like his desire, lift vpwards and diuine, So large of lims, his ioints so strongly knit, Such breadth of shoulders as might mainely beare Olde Atlas burthen, twixt his manly pitch, A pearle more worth, then all the world is plaste: Wherein by curious soueraintie of Art, Are fixt his piercing instruments of sight: Whose fiery cyrcles beare encompassed A heauen of heauenly bodies in their Spheares: That guides his steps and actions to the throne, Where honor sits inuested royally: Pale of complexion: wrought in him with passion, Thrirsting with souerainty with loue of armes, His lofty browes in foldes, do figure death, And in their smoothnesse, amitie and life: About them hangs a knot of Amber heire. Wrapped in curles, as fierce Achilles was, On which the breath of heauen delights to play, Making it daunce with wanton maiestie: His armes and fingers long and snowy, Betokening valour and excesse of strength: In euery part proportioned like the man, Should make the world subdued to Tamburlaine. Cos. Wel hast thou pourtraid in thy tearms of life, The face and personage of a woondrous man: Nature doth striue with Fortune and his stars, To make him famous in accomplisht woorth: And well his merits show him to be made: His Fortunes maister, and the king of men. That could perswade at such a sodaine pinch, With reasons of his valour and his life, A thousand sworne and ouermatching foes: Then when our powers in points of swords are ioin'd And closde in compasse of the killing bullet, Though straight the passage and the port be made, That leads to Pallace of my brothers life, Proud is his fortune if we pierce it not. And when the princely Persean Diadem, Shall ouerway his wearie witlesse head, And fall like mellowed fruit, with shakes of death, In faire Persea noble tamburlaine Shall be my Regent, and remaine as King: Ort.

And such shall wait on worthy Tamburlaine, Our army will be forty thousand strong, When Tamburlain and braue Theridamas Haue met vs by the riuer Araris: And all conioin'd to meet the witlesse King, That now is marching neer to Parthia.

And of that false Cosroe, my traiterous brother Would it not grieue a King to be so abusde. And haue a thousand horsmen tane away? And which is worst to haue his Diadem Sought for by such scalde knaues as loue him not? I thinke it would: wel then, by heauens I sweare, Aurora shall not peepe out of her doores, But I will haue Cosroe by the head, And kill proud Tamburlaine with point of sword. Tell you the rest (Meander) I haue said. Mean. Then hauing past Armenian desarts now, And pitch our tents vnder the Georgean hilles. Whose tops are couered with Tartarian thieues, That lie in ambush, waiting for a pray: What should we doe but bid them battaile straight, And rid the world of those detested troopes? Least if we let them lynger here a while, They gather strength by power of fresh supplies. This countrie swarmes with vile outragious men, That liue by rapine and by lawlesse spoile, Fit Souldiers for the wicked Tamburlaine. And he that could with giftes and promises. Inueigle him that lead a thousand horse, And make him false his faith vnto his King, Will quickly win such as are like himselfe. Therefore cheere vp your mindes, prepare to fight, He that can take or slaughter tamburlaine, Shall rule the Prouince of Albania. Who brings that Traitors head theridamas, Shal haue a gouernment in Medea: Beside the spoile of him and all his traine: But if Cosroe (as our Spials say, And as we know) remaines with tamburlaine, His Highnesse pleasure is that he should liue, And be reclaim'd with princely lenitie. A Spy. An hundred horsmen of my company Scowting abroad vpon these champion plaines, Haue view'd the army of the Scythians, Which make reports it far exceeds the Kings. Mean. Suppose they be in number infinit, Yet being void of Martiall discipline, All running headlong after greedy spoiles: And more regarding gaine than victory: Like to the cruell brothers of the earth, Sprong of the teeth of Dragons venomous, Their carelesse swords shal lanch their fellowes throats And make vs triumph in their ouerthrow. Myc. Was there such brethren, sweet Meander, say That sprong of teeth of Dragons venomous. Meand. So Poets say, my Lord. Myce. And tis a prety toy to be a Poet.

Then noble souldiors, to intrap these theeues, That liue confounded in disordered troopes, If wealth or riches may preuaile with them, We haue our Cammels laden all with gold: Which you that be but common souldiers, Shall fling in euery corner of the field: And while the base borne Tartars take it vp, You fighting more for honor than for gold, Shall massacre those greedy minded slaues. And when their scattered armie is subdu'd: And you march on their slaughtered carkasses, Share equallly the gold that bought their liues, And liue like Gentlemen in Persea, Strike vp the Drum and martch corragiously, Fortune her selfe dooth sit vpon our Crests.

Tamb. And so mistake you not a whit my Lord. For Fates and Oracles, heauen haue sworne, To roialise the deedes of tamburlaine: And make them blest that share in his attemptes. And doubt you not, but if you fauour me, And let my Fortunes and my valour sway, To some direction in your martiall deeds, The world will striue with hostes of men at armes. To swarme vnto the Ensigne I support, The host of Xerxes, which by fame is said To drinke the mightie Parthian Araris, Was but a handful to that we will haue. Our quiuering Lances shaking in the aire, And bullets like Ioues dreadfull Thunderbolts, Enrolde in flames and fiery smoldering mistes, Shall threat the Gods more than Cyclopian warres, And with our Sun-bright armour as we march, Weel chase the Stars from heauen, and dim their eies That stand and muse at our admyred armes. therid.

For Kings are clouts that euery man shoots at, Our Crowne the pin that thousands seeke to cleaue, Therefore in pollicie I thinke it good To hide it close: a goodly Stratagem, And far from any man that is a foole.

What better president than mightie Ioue? Nature that fram'd vs of foure Elements, Warring within our breasts for regiment, Doth teach vs all to haue aspyring minds: Our soules, whose faculties can comprehend The wondrous Architecture of the world: And measure euery wandring plannets course. Still climing after knowledge infinite, And alwaies moouing as the restles Spheares. Wils vs to weare our selues and neuer rest. Untill we reach the ripest fruit of all.

And all the sea my Gallies countermaund. Then shall our footmen lie within the trench, And with their Cannons mouth'd like Orcus gulfe Batter the walles, and we will enter in: And thus the Grecians shall be conquered. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na. 2. Agidas , Zenocrate, Anippe, with others. Madam Zenocrate, may I presume To know the cause of these vnquiet fits: That worke such trouble to your woonted rest: Tis more then pitty such a heauenly face Should by hearts sorrow wax so wan and pale. When your offensiue rape by tamburlaine, (Which of your whole displeasures should be most) Hath seem'd to be digested long agoe. Zen. Although it be digested long agoeâ As his exceding fauours haue deseru'd, And might content the Queene of heauen as well: As it hath chang'd my first conceiu'd disdaine. Yet since a farther passion feeds my thoughts, With ceaselesse and disconsolate conceits. Which dies my lookes so liuelesse as they are. And might, if my extreams had full euents, Make me the gastly counterfeit of death. Agid. Eternall heauen sooner be dissolu'd. And all that pierceth PhÅbes siluer eie, Before such hap fall to zenocrate. zen. Ah, life, and soule still houer in his Breast. And leaue my body sencelesse as the earth. Or els vnite you to his life and soule, That I may liue and die with tamburlaine. Enter Tamburlaine with Techelles and others. Agid. With tamburlaine? Ah faire zenocrate. Let not a man so vile and barbarous, That holds you from your father in despight, And keeps you from the honors of a Queene. Being supposde his worthlesse Concubine. Be honored with your loue, but for necessity. So now the mighty Souldan heares of you, Your Highnesse needs not doubt but in short time, He will with Tamburlaines destruction Redeeme you from this deadly seruitude. Zen. leaue to wound me with these words. And speake of tamburlaine as he deserues: The entertainment we haue had of him, Is far from villanie or seruitude. And might in noble minds be counted princely. Agid. How can you fancie one that lookes so fierce, Onelie disposed to martiall Stratagems? Who when he shall embrace you in his armes, Will tell how many thousand men he slew. And when you looke for amorous discourse, Will rattle foorth his facts of war and blood. Too harsh a subiect for your dainty eares. Zen. As looks the sun through Nilus flowing stream, Or when the morning holds him in her armes. So lookes my Lordly loue, faire tamburlaine: His talke much sweeter than the Muses song, They sung for honor gainst Pierides. Or when Minerua did with Neptune striue, And higher would I reare my estimate, Than Iuno sister to the highest God. If I were matcht with mightie tamburlaine. Agid. Yet be not so inconstant in your loue, But let the yong Arabian liue in hope, After your rescue to eioy his choise. You see though first the King of Persea (Being a Shepheard) seem'd to loue you much, Now in his maiesty he leaues those lookes, Those words of fauour, and those comfortings, And giues no more than common courtesies. Zen. Thence rise the tears that so distain my cheeks, Fearing his loue through my vnworthynesse. Tamburlaine goes to her, &amp; takes her away louingly by the hand, looking wrathfully on Agidas, and sayes nothing. Agid. Betraide by fortune and suspitious loue. Threatned with frowning wrath and iealousie. Surpriz d with feare of hideous reuenge. I stand agast: but most astonied To see his choller shut in secrete thoughtes, And wrapt in silence of his angry soule. Upon his browes was pourtraid vgly death, And in his eies the furie of his hart. That shine as Comets, menacing reuenge. And casts a pale complexion on his cheeks. As when the Sea-man sees the Hyades Gather an armye of Cemerian clouds, (Auster and Aquilon with winged Steads All sweating, tilt about the watery heauens, With shiuering speares enforcing thunderclaps. And from their shieldes strike flames of lightening) All fearefull foldes his sailes, and sounds the maine, Lifting his prayers to the heauens for aid, Against the terrour of the winds and waues. So fares Agydas for the late felt frownes That sent a tempest to my daunted thoughtes, And makes my soule deuine her ouerthrow. Enter Techelles with a naked dagger. tech. See you Agidas how the King salutes you. He bids you prophesie what it imports. Exit. Agid. I prophecied before and now I prooue, The killing frownes of iealousie and loue. He needed not with words confirme my feare, For words are vaine where working tooles present The naked action of my threatned end. It saies, Agydas, thou shalt surely die. And of extremities elect the least, More honor and lesse paine it may procure, To dy by this resolued hand of thine, Than stay the torments he and heauen haue sworne. Then haste Agydas, and preuent the plagues: Which thy prolonged Fates may draw on thee: Go wander free from feare of Tyrants rage. Remooued from the Torments and the hell: Wherewith he may excruciate thy soule. And let Agidas by Agidas die. And with this stab slumber eternally. tech. Vsumeasane, see how right the man Hath hit the meaning of my Lord the King. Vsum. Faith, and techelles, it was manly done: And since he was so wise and honorable, Let vs affoord him now the bearing hence. And craue his triple worthy buriall. tech. Agreed Casane, we wil honor him. ScÃ¦na. 3, Tamburlain, Techelles, Vsumeasane, Theridamas, Bassoe, Zenocrate, with others. Tamburlaine. Bassoe, by this thy Lord and maister knowes, I meane to meet him in Bithynia: see how he comes? Tush. Turkes are ful of brags And menace more than they can wel performe: He meet me in the field and fetch thee hence? Alas (poore Turke) his fortune is to weake, T'incounter with the strength of Tamburlaine. Uiew well my Camp, and speake indifferently, Doo not my captaines and my souldiers looke As if they meant to conquer Affrica. Bass. Your men are valiant but their number few, And cannot terrefie his mightie hoste, My Lord, the great Commander of the worlde, Besides fifteene contributorie kings, Hath now in armes ten thousand Ianisaries, Mounted on lusty Mauritanian Steeds. Brought to the war by men of Tripoly. Two hundred thousand footmen that haue seru'd In two set battels fought in Grecia: And for the expedition of this war, If he think good, can from his garrisons, Withdraw as many more to follow him. tech. The more he brings, the greater is the spoile, For when they perish by our warlike hands, We meane to seate our footmen on their Steeds. And rifle all those stately Ianisars. tam. But wil those Kings accompany your Lord? Bass. Such as his Highnesse please, but some must stay To rule the prouinces he late subdude. tam. Th? fight couragiously, their crowns are yours This hand shal set them on your conquering heads: That made me Emperour of Asia. Vsum. Let him bring millions infinite of men, Unpeopling Westerne Affrica and Greece: Yet we assure vs of the victorie. ther. Euen he that in a trice vanquisht two kings, More mighty than the Turkish Emperour: Shall rouse him out of Europe, and pursue His scattered armie til they yeeld or die. tamb. Wel said theridamas, speake in that mood, For Wil and Shall best fitteth Tamburlain, Whose smiling stars giues him assured hope Of martiall triumph, ere he meete his foes: I that am tearm'd the Scourge and Wrath of God, The onely feare and terrour of the world, Wil first subdue the Turke, and then inlarge Those Christian Captiues, which you keep as slaues, Burdening their bodies with your heauie chaines. And feeding them with thin and slender fare, That naked rowe about the Terrene sea. And when they chance to breath and rest a space, Are punisht with Bastones so grieuously, That they lie panting on the Gallies side. And striue for life at euery stroke they giue, These are the cruell pirates of Argeire, That damned traine, the scum of Affrica. Inhabited with stragling Runnagates, That make quick hauock of the Christian blood. But as I liue that towne shall curse the time That Tamburlaine set foot in Affrica: Enter Baiazeth with his Bassoes and contributorie Kinges. Bai. Bassoes and Ianisaries of my Guard, Attend vpon the person of your Lord, The greatest Potentate of Affrica. Tam. Techelles, and the rest prepare your swordes I meane t'incounter with that Baiazeth. Bai. Kings of Fesse, Moroccus and Argier, He cals me Baiazeth, whom you call Lord. Note the presumption of this Scythian slaue: I tell thee villaine, those that lead my horse Haue to their names tytles of dignity, And dar'st thou bluntly call me Baiazeth? Tam. And know thou Turke, that those which lead my horse, Shall lead thee Captiue thorow Affrica. And dar'st thou bluntly call me tamburlaine? Bai. By Mahomet, my Kinsmans sepulcher. And by the holy Alcaron I sweare, He shall be made a chast and lustlesse Eunuke, And in my Sarell tend my Concubines: And all his Captaines that thus stoutly stand, Shall draw the chariot of my Emperesse. Whom I haue brought to see their ouerthrow. Tamb. By this my sword that conquer'd Persea, Thy fall shall make me famous through the world: I will not tell thee how Ile handle thee, But euery common souldier of my Camp Shall smile to see thy miserable state. Fess. What meanes the mighty Turkish Emperor To talk with one so base as tamburlaine. Moro. Ye Moores and valiant men of Barbary, How can ye suffer these indignities. Arg. Leaue words and let them feele your lances pointes. Which glided through the bowels of the Greekes. Bai. Wel said my stout contributory kings, Your threefold armie and my hugie hoste, Shall swallow vp these base borne Perseans, tech. Puissant, renowmed and mighty tamburlain, Why stay we thus prolonging all their liues? ther. I long to see those crownes won by our swords That we may raigne as kings of Affrica. Vsum. What Coward wold not fight for such a prize? Tamb. Fight all couragiously and be you kings. I speake it, and my words are oracles. Bai. Zabina, mother of three brauer boies, Than Hercules, that in his infancie Did pash the iawes of Serpents venomous: Whose hands are made to gripe a warlike Lance. Their shoulders broad, for complet armour fit, Their lims more large and of a bigger size Than all the brats ysprong from Typhons loins: Who, when they come vnto their fathers age, Will batter Turrets with their manly fists. Sit here vpon this royal chaire of state, And on thy head weare my Emperiall crowne, Untill I bring this sturdy tamburlain, And all his Captains bound in captiue chaines. zab. Such good successe happen to Baiazeth. Tam. zenocrate, the loueliest Maide aliue, Fairer than rockes of pearle and pretious stone, The onely Paragon of tamburlaine, Whose eies are brighter than the Lamps of heauen. And speech more pleasant than sweet harmony: That with thy lookes canst cleare the darkened Sky: And calme the rage of thundring Iupiter: Sit downe by her: adorned with my Crowne, As if thou wert the Empresse of the world. Stir not zenocrate vntill thou see Me martch victoriously with all my men, Triumphing ouer him and these his kings, Which I will bring as Uassals to thy feete. Til then take thou my crowne, vaunt of my worth, And manage words with her as we will armes. zen. And may my Loue, the king of Persea Returne with victorie, and free from wound. Bai. Now shalt thou feel the force of Turkish arms, Which lately made all Europe quake for feare: I haue of Turkes, Arabians, Moores and Iewes Enough to couer all Bythinia, Let thousands die, their slaughtered Carkasses Shal serue for walles and bulwarkes to the rest: And as the heads of Hydra, so my power Subdued, shall stand as mighty as before: If they should yeeld their necks vnto the sword, Thy souldiers armes could not endure to strike So many blowes as I haue heads for thee. Thou knowest not (foolish hardy Tamburlaine) What tis to meet me in the open field, That leaue no ground for thee to martch vpon. Tam. Our conquering swords shall marshal vs the way We vse to march vpon the slaughtered foe: Trampling their bowels with our horses hooffes: Braue horses, bred on the white Tartarian hils: My Campe is like to Iulius CÃ¦sars Hoste, That neuer fought but had the victorie: Nor in Pharsalia was there such hot war, As these my followers willingly would haue: Legions of Spirits fleeting in the aire, Direct our Bullets and our weapons pointes And make our strokes to wound the sencelesse lure, And when she sees our bloody Collours spread. Then Uictorie begins to take her flight, Resting her selfe vpon my milk-white Tent: But come my Lords, to weapons let vs fall. The field is ours, the Turk, his wife and all. Exit, with his followers. Bai. Come Kings and Bassoes let vs glut our swords That thirst to drinke the feble Perseans blood. Exit, with his followers. zab. Base Concubine, must thou be plac'd by me That am the Empresse of the mighty Turke? zen. Disdainful Turkesse and vnreuerend Bosse, Call'st thou me Concubine that am betroath'd Unto the great and mighty tamburlaine? Zab. To tamburlaine the great Tartarian thiefe? Zen. Thou wilt repent these lauish words of thine, When thy great Bassoe, maister and thy selfe. Must plead for mercie at his kingly feet, And sue to me to be your Aduocates. Zab. And sue to thee? I tell thee shamelesse girle, Thou shalt be Landresse to my waiting maid. How lik'st thou her Ebea, will she serue? Ebea. Madame, she thinks perhaps she is too fine. But I shall turne her into other weedes. And make her daintie fingers fall to woorke. Zen. hearst thou Anippe, how thy drudge doth talk, And how my slaue, her mistresse menaceth. Both for their sausinesse shall be employed, To dresse the common souldiers meat and drink. For we will scorne they should come nere our selues. Anip. Yet somtimes let your highnesse send for th? To do the work my chamber maid disdaines. They sound the battell within, and stay Zen. Ye Gods and powers that gouerne Persea. And made my lordly Loue her worthy King: Now strengthen him against the Turkish Baiazeth, And let his foes like flockes of fearfull Roes, Pursude by hunters, flie his angrie lookes, That I may see him issue Conquerour. Zab. Now Mahomet, solicit God himselfe, And make him raine down murthering shot fr? heauen To dash the Scythians braines, and strike them dead, That dare to manage armes with him, That offered iewels to thy sacred shrine. When first he war'd against the Christians. To the battell againe. Zen. By this the Turks lie weltring in their blood And tamburlaine is Lord of Affrica: Zab. Thou art deceiu'd, I heard the Trumpets sound, As when my Emperour ouerthrew the Greeks: And led them Captiue into Affrica. Straight will I vse thee as thy pride deserues: Prepare thy selfe to liue and die my slaue. Zen. If Mahomet should come from heauen and sweare, My royall Lord is slaine or conquered. Yet should he not perswade me otherwise. But that he liues and will be Conquerour. Baiazeth flies, and he pursues him. The battell short, and they enter, Baiazeth is ouercome. Tam. Now king of Bassoes, who is Conqueror? Bai. Thou, by the fortune of this damned soile, Tam. Where are your stout contributorie kings? Enter Techelles, Theridamas, Vsumeasane. Tech. We haue their crownes their bodies strowe the fielde. Tam. Each man a crown? why kingly fought ifaith Deliuer them into my treasurie. Zen. Now let me offer to my gracious Lord. His royall Crowne againe, so highly won: tam. Nay take the Turkish Crown from her, zen. And crowne me Emperour of Affrica. Zab. No tamburlain, though now thou gat the best Thou shalt not yet be Lord of Affrica. ther. Giue her the Crowne Turkesse you wer best. He takes it from her. and giues it Zenocrate, zab. Iniurious villaines, thieues, runnagates, How dare you thus abuse my Maiesty? ther. Here Madam, you are Empresse, she is none. tam. Not now theridamas, her time is past: The pillers that haue bolstered vp those tearmes, Are falne in clusters at my conquering feet. zab. Though he be prisoner, he may be ransomed: tamb. Not all the world shall ransom Baiazeth. Bai. Ah faire zabina, we haue lost the field. And neuer had the Turkish Emperour So great a foile by any forraine foe. Now will the Christian miscreants be glad, Ringing with ioy their superstitious belles: And making bonfires for my ouerthrow. But ere I die those foule Idolaters Shall make me bonfires with their filthy bones, For though the glorie of this day be lost. Affrik and Greece haue garrisons enough To make me Soueraigne of the earth againe. Tam. Those walled garrisons wil I subdue, And write my selfe great Lord of Affrica: So from the East vnto the furthest West, Shall tamburlain extend his puisant arme. The Galles and those pilling Briggandines, That yeerely saile to the Uenetian gulfe, And houer in the straightes for Christians wracke, Shall lie at anchor in the Isle Asant. Untill the Persean Fleete and men of war, Sailing along the Orientall sea, Haue fetcht about the Indian continent: Euen from Persepolis to Mexico, And thence vnto the straightes of Iubalter: Where they shall meete, and ioine their force in one, Keeping in aw the Bay of Portingale. And all the Ocean by the British shore: And by this meanes Ile win the world at last. Bai. Yet set a ransome on me tamburlaine. Tam. What, thinkst thou tamburlain esteems thy gold, Ile make the kings of India ere I die, Offer their mines (to sew for peace) to me, And dig for treasure to appease my wrath: Come bind them both and one lead in the Turke. The Turkesse let my Loues maid lead away. They bind them. Bai. Ah villaines, dare ye touch my sacred armes. O Mahomet, Oh sleepie Mahomet. zab. O cursed Mahomet that makest vs thus The slaues to Scythians rude and barbarous. Tam. Come bring them in, &amp; for this happy c?quest Triumph, and solemnize a martiall feast. Exeunt.

Awake ye men of Memphis, heare the clange Of Scythian trumpets, heare the Basiliskes, That roaring, shake Damascus turrets downe. The rogue of Volga holds zenocrate, The Souldans daughter for his Concubine, And with a troope of theeues and vagabondes. Hath spread his collours to our high disgrace: While you faint-hearted base Egyptians, Lie slumbering on the flowrie bankes of Nile, As Crocodiles that vnaffrighted rest, While thundring Cannons rattle on their Skins. Mess. Nay (mightie Souldan) did your greatnes see The frowning lookes of fiery Tamburlaine, That with his terrour and imperious eies, Commandes the hearts of his associates, It might amaze your royall maiesty. Soul. Uillain. I tell thee, were that tamburlaine. As monstrous as Gorgon, prince of Hell, The Souldane would not start a foot from him. But speake, what power hath he? Mess. Mightie Lord, Three hundred thousand men in armour clad, Upon their pransing Steeds, disdainfully With wanton paces trampling on the ground. Fiue hundred thousand footmen threatning shot, Shaking their swords, their speares and yron bils, Enuironing their Standard round, that stood As bristle-pointed as a thorny wood. Their warlike Engins and munition Exceed the forces of their martial men. Soul. Nay could their n?bers counteruail the stars Or euer drisling drops of Aprill showers, Or withered leaues that Autume shaketh downe. Yet would the Souldane by his conquering power: So scatter and consume them in his rage, That not a man should liue to rue their fall, Cap. So might your highnesse, had you time to sort Your fighting men, and raise your royall hoste. But tamburlaine, by expedition Aduantage takes of your vnreadinesse. Soul. Let him take all th'aduantages he can, Were all the world conspird to fight for him, Nay, were he Deuill, as he is no man, Yet in reuenge of faire Zenocrate, Whom he detameth in despight of vs, This arme should send him downe to Erebus. To shroud his shame in darknes of the night. Mess. Pleaseth your mightinesse to vnderstand, His resolution far exceedeth all: The first day when he pitcheth downe his tentes, White is their hew, and on his siluer crest A snowy Feather spangled white he beares, To signify the mildnesse of his minde. That satiate with spoile refuseth blood: But when Aurora mounts the second time, As red as scarlet is his furniture, Then must his kindled wrath bee quencht with blood, Not sparing any that can manage armes: But if these threats mooue not submission. Black are his collours, blacke Pauilion, His speare, his shield, his horse, his armour, plumes, And Ietty Feathers menace death and hell, Without respect of Sex, degree or age. He raceth all his foes with fire and sword. Soul. Mercilesse villaine, Pesant ignorant, Of lawfull armes, or martiall discipline: Pillage and murder are his vsuall trades. The slaue vsurps the glorious name of war, See Capolin the faire Arabian king, That hath bene disapointed by this slaue: Of my faire daughter, and his princely Loue: May haue fresh warning to go war with vs, And be reueng'd for her dispardgement.

Now cleare the triple region of the aire, And let the maiestie of heauen beholde Their Scourge and Terrour treade on Emperours, Smile Stars that raign'd at my natiuity: And dim the brightnesse of their neighbor Lamps, Disdaine to borrow light of Cynthia, For I the chiefest Lamp of all the earth, First rising in the East with milde aspect, But fixed now in the Meridian line, Will send vp fire to your turning Spheares, And cause the Sun to borrowe light of you. My sword stroke fire from his coat of steele, Euen in Bythinia, when I took this Turke: As when a fiery exhalation Wrapt in the bowels of a freezing cloude, Fighting for passage, make the Welkin cracke, And casts a flash of lightning to the earth. But ere I martch to wealthy Persea, Or leaue Damascus and th'Egyptian fields, As was the fame of Clymeus brain-sicke sonne, That almost brent the Axeltree of heauen, So shall our swords, our lances and our shot.

Unworthy king, that by thy crueltie, Unlawfully vsurpest the Persean seat: Dar'st thou that neuer saw an Emperour, Before thou met my husband in the field, Being thy Captiue, thus abuse his state, Keeping his kingly body in a Cage, That rooffes of golde, and sun-bright Pallaces, Should haue prepar'd to entertaine his Grace?

Confusion light on him that helps thee thus. tam. There whiles he liues, shal Baiezeth be kept, And where I goe be thus in triumph drawne: And thou his wife shalt feed him with the scraps My seruitures shall bring the from my boord. For he that giues him other food than this: Shall sit by him and starue to death himselfe. This is my minde, and I will haue it so. Not all the Kings and Emperours of the Earth: If they would lay their crownes before my feet, Shall ransome him, or take him from his cage. The ages that shall talk of Tamburlain, Euen from this day to Platoes wondrous yeare, Shall talke how I haue handled Baiazeth. These Mores that drew him from Bythinia, To faire Damascus, where we now remaine, Shall lead him with vs wheresoere we goe. Techelles, and my louing followers, Now may we see Damascus lofty towers, Like to the shadowes of Pyramides, That with their beauties grac'd the Memphion fields: The golden stature of their feathered bird That spreads her wings vpon the citie wals, Shall not defend it from our battering shot. The townes-men maske in silke and cloath of gold. And euery house is as a treasurie. The men, the treasure, and the towne is ours. Ther.

And when they see me march in black aray, With mournfull streamers hanging down their heads, Were in that citie all the world contain'd. Not one should scape: but perish by our swords. zen.

Methinks we martch as Meliager did, Enuironed with braue Argolian knightes: To chace the sauage Caldonian Boare, Or Cephalus with lustie Thebane youths. Against the Woolfe that angrie Themis sent. To waste and spoile the sweet Aonian fieldes. A monster of fiue hundred thousand heades, Compact of Rapine, Pyracie, and spoile. The Scum of men, the hate and Scourge of God, Raues in Egyptia, and annoyeth vs. My Lord it is the bloody Tamburlaine. A sturdy Felon and a base-bred Thiefe. By murder raised to the Persean Crowne. That dares controll vs in our Territories. To tame the pride of this presumotuous Beast, Ioine your Arabians with the Souldans power: Let vs vnite our royall bandes in one, And hasten to remooue Damascus siege. It is a blemish to the Maiestie And high estate of mightie Emperours, That such a base vsurping vagabond Should braue a king, or weare a princely crowne. Ara.

Unto the hallowed person of a prince, Or kept the faire zenocrate so long. As Concubine, I feare to feed his lust. Ara. Let griefe and furie hasten on reuenge, Let Tamburlaine for his offences feele Such plagues as heauen and we can poure on him. I long to breake my speare vpon his crest, And prooue the waight of his victorious arme: For Fame I feare hath bene too prodigall: In sounding through the world his partiall praise: Soul. Capolin, hast thou suruaid our powers. Cap. Great Emperours of Egypt and Arabia. The number of your hostes vnited is, A hundred and fifty thousand horse, Two hundred thousand foot, braue men at armes, Couragious and full of hardinesse: As frolike as the hunters in the chace: Of sauage beastes amid the desart woods. Arab. My mind presageth fortunate successe, And tamburlaine, my spirit doth foresee The vtter ruine of thy men and thee. Soul. Then reare your standardes, let your sounding Drummes Direct our Souldiers to Damascus walles. Now Tamburlaine, the mightie Souldane comes, And leads with him the great Arabian King. To dim thy basenesse and obscurity. Famous for nothing but for theft and spoile, To race and scatter thy inglorious crue, Of Scythians and slauish Persians. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na 5.

While they walke quiuering on their citie walles, Halfe dead for feare before they feele my wrath: Then let vs freely banquet and carouse Full bowles of wine vnto the God of war, That meanes to fill your helmets full of golde: And make Damascus spoiles as rich to you, As was to Iason Colchos golden fleece. And now Baiazeth, hast thou any stomacke? Bai. I, such a stomacke (cruel tamburlane) as I could Willingly feed vpon thy blood-raw hart. tam. Nay, thine owne is easier to come by, plucke out that, And twil serue thee and thy wife: Wel zenocrate, techelles, and the rest, fall to your victuals. Bai. Fall to, and neuer may your meat digest. Ye Furies that can maske inuisible, Diue to the bottome of Auernas poole, And in your hands bring hellish poison vp. And squease it in the cup of tamburlain. Or winged snakes of Lerna cast your stings, And leaue your venoms in this Tyrants dish. zab. And may this banquet prooue as omenous, As Prognes to th'adulterous Thracian King. That fed vpon the substance of his child. zen. My Lord, how can you suffer these outragious curses By these slaues of yours? tam. To let them see (diuine zenocrate) I glorie in the curses of my foes. Hauing the power fr? the Emperiall heauen, To turne them al vpon their proper heades. tech. I pray you giue them leaue Madam, this speech is a goodly refreshing to them. Ther. But if his highnesse would let them be fed, it would doe them more good. tam. Sirra, why fall you not too, are you so daintily brought vp, you cannot eat your owne flesh? Bai. First legions of deuils shall teare thee in peeces. Vsum. Uillain, knowest thou to whom thou speakest tam. O let him alone: here, eat sir, take it from my swords point, or Ile thrust it to thy heart. He takes it and stamps vpon it. ther He stamps it vnder his feet my Lord. tam. Take it vp Uillaine and eat it, or I will make thee slice the brawnes of thy armes into carbonadoes, and eat them. vsu. Nay, twere better he kild his wife, &amp; then she shall be sure not to be staru'd, &amp; he be prouided for a moneths victuall before hand. tam, Here is my dagger, dispatch her while she is fat, for if she liue but a while longer, shee will fall into a comsumption with freatting, and then she will not bee woorth the eating. ther. Doost thou think that Mahomet wil suffer this tech. Tis like he wil, when he cannot let it. tam. Go to, fal to your meat: what not a bit? belike he hath not bene watered to day, giue him some drinke. They giue him water to drinke, and he flings it on the ground. Faste and welcome sir, while hunger make you eat. How now zenocrate, dooth not the Turke and his wife make a goodly showe at a banquet? Zen. Yes, my Lord. ther Me thinks, tis a great deale better than a consort of musicke. tam. Yet musicke woulde doe well to cheare vp zenocrate: pray thee tel, why art thou so sad? If thou wilt haue a song, the Turke shall straine his voice: but why is it? Zen. My lord, to see my fathers towne besieg'd, The countrie wasted where my selfe was borne, How can it but afflict my verie soule? If any loue remaine in you my Lord, Or if my loue vnto your maiesty May merit fauour at your highnesse handes, Then raise your siege from faire Damascus walles, And with my father take a frindly truce. tamb. Zenocrate, were Egypt Ioues owne land, Yet would I with my sword make Ioue to stoope, I will confute those blind Geographers That make a triple region in the world, Excluding Regions which I meane to trace, And with this pen reduce them to a Map. Calling the Prouinces, Citties and townes After my name and thine zenocrate: Here at Damascus will I make the Point That shall begin the Perpendicular. And wouldst thou haue me buy thy Fathers loue With such a losse? Tell me zenocrate? Zen. Honor still waight on happy tamburlaine Yet giue me leaue to plead for him my Lord. Tam. Content thy selfe, his person shall be safe. And all the friendes of faire Zenocrate, If with their liues they will be pleasde to yeeld, Or may be forc'd to make me Emperour. For Egypt and Arabia must be mine. Feed your slaue, thou maist thinke thy selfe happie to be fed from my trencher. Bai. My empty stomacke ful of idle heat, Drawes bloody humours from my feeble partes, Preseruing life, by hasting cruell death. My vaines are pale, my sinowes hard and drie, My iointes benumb'd, vnlesse I eat, I die. Zab. Eat Baiazeth, Let vs liue in spite of them, Looking some happie power will pitie and inlarge vs. tam. Here Turk, wilt thou haue a cleane trencher? Bai. I Tyrant, and more meat. tam. Soft sir, you must be dieted, too much eating will make you surfeit. ther. So it would my lord, specially hauing so smal a walke, and so litle exercise. Enter a second course of Crownes. tam. Theridamas, techelles and Casane, here are the cates you desire to finger, are they not? ther. I (my Lord) but none saue kinges must feede with these. tech. Tis enough for vs to see them, and for tamburlaine onely to enioy them. tam. Wel, Here is now to the Souldane of Egypt the King of Arabia, and the Gouernour of Damascus. Now take these three crownes, and pledge me, my contributorie Kings. I crowne you here (Theridamas) King of Argier: Techelles King of Fesse, and Vsumeasane King of Morocus. How say you to this (Turke) these are not your contributorie kings. Bai. Nor shall they long be thine, I warrant them. tam. Kings of Argier, Morocus, and of Fesse. You that haue martcht with happy Tamburlaine, As far as from the frozen place of heauen. Unto the watry mornings ruddy hower. And thence by land vnto the Torrid Zone, Deserue these tytles I endow you with. By value and by magnanimity. Your byrthes shall be no blemish to your fame. For vertue is the fount whence honor springs. And they are worthy she inuesteth kings. ther. And since your highnesse hath so well vouchsaft, If we deserue them not with higher meeds Then erst our states and actions haue retain'd, Take them away againe and make vs slaues. Tam. Wel said Theridamas, when holy Fates Shall stablish me in strong Egyptia. We meane to traueile to th'Antatique Pole, Conquering the people vnderneath our feet. And be renowm'd, as neuer Emperours were. zenocrate, I will not crowne thee yet, Until with greater honors I be grac'd. Finis Actus quarti.</field>

Ah faire Zenocrate, diuine Zenocrate, Faire is too foule an Epithite for thee, That in thy passion for thy countries loue, And feare to see thy kingly Fathers harme, With haire discheweld wip'st thy watery cheeks: And like to Flora in her mornings pride, Shaking her siluer treshes in the aire. Rain'st on the earth resolued pearle in showers, And sprinklest Saphyrs on thy shining face, Wher Beauty, mother to the Muses sits, And comments vollumes with her Yuory pen: Taking instructions from thy flowing eies, Eies when that Ebena steps to heauen. In silence of thy solemn Euenings walk. Making the mantle of the richest night. The Moone, the Planets, and the Meteors light, There Angels in their christal armours fight A doubtfull battell with my tempted thoughtes, For Egypts freedom and the Souldans life: His life that so consumes Zenocrate, Whose sorrowes lay more siege vnto my soule, Than all my Army to Damascus walles. And neither Perseans Soueraign, nor the Turk Troubled my sences with conceit of foile, So much by much, as dooth zenocrate. What is beauty saith my sufferings then? If all the pens that euer poets held, Had fed the feeling of their maisters thoughts, And euery sweetnes that inspir'd their harts, Their minds, and muses on admyred theames: If all the heauenly Quintessence they still From their immortall flowers of Poesy, Wherein as in a myrrour we perceiue The highest reaches of a humaine wit. If these had made one Poems period And all combin'd in Beauties worthinesse, Yet should ther houer in their restlesse heads, One thought, one grace, one woonder at the least, Which into words no vertue can digest: But how vnseemly is it for my Sex My discipline of armes and Chiualrie, My nature and the terrour of my name. To harbour thoughts effeminate and faint? Saue onely that in Beauties iust applause, With whose instinct the soule of man is toucht. And euery warriour that is rapt with loue, Of fame, of valour, and of victory Must needs haue beauty beat on his conceites, I thus conceiuing and subduing both: That which hath stopt the tempest of the Gods, Euen from the fiery spangled vaile of heauen, To feele the louely warmth of shepheards flames. And martch in cottages of strowed weeds, Shal giue the world to note for all my byrth, That Uertue solely is the sum of glorie, And fashions men with true nobility. Who's within there?

No more there is not I warrant thee techelles They bring in the Turke. ther. We know the victorie is ours my Lord, But let vs saue the reuerend Souldans life, For faire Zenocrate, that so laments his state. tamb. That will we chiefly see vnto, theridamas. For sweet zenocrate, whose worthinesse Deserues a conquest ouer euery hart: And now my footstoole, if I loose the field, You hope of libertie and restitution: Here let him stay my maysters from the tents, Till we haue made vs ready for the field. Pray for vs Baiazeth, we are going. Exeunt. Bai. Go, neuer to returne with victorie: Millions of men encompasse thee about. And gore thy body with as many wounds, Sharpe forked arrowes light vpon thy horse: Furies from the blacke Cocitus lake, Breake vp the earth, and with their firebrands, Enforce thee run vpon the banefull pikes. Uolleyes of shot pierce through thy charmed Skin, And euery bullet dipt in poisoned drugs, Or roaring Cannons seuer all thy ioints. Making thee mount as high as Eagles soare. zab. Let all the swords and Lances in the field, Stick in his breast, as in their proper roomes, At euery pore let blood comme dropping foorth. That lingring paines may massacre his heart. And madnesse send his damned soule to hell. Bai. Ah faire zabina, we may curse his power, The heauens may frowne, the earth for anger quake, But such a Star hath influence in his sword, As rules the Skies, and countermands the Gods. More than Cymerian Stix or Distinie: And then shall we in this detested guyse, With shame, with hungar, and with horror aie Griping our bowels with retorqued thoughtes, And haue no hope to end our extasies. zab. Then is there left no Mahomet, no God, No Feend, no Fortune, nor no hope of end? To our infamous monstrous slaueries: Gape earth, and let the Feends infernall view, As hell, as hoplesse and as full of feare As are the blasted banks of Erebus: Where shaking ghosts with euer howling grones, Houer about the vgly Ferriman, to get a passage to Elisi? why should we liue, O wretches, beggars slaues Why liue we Baiazeth, and build vp neasts, So high within the region of the aire, By liuing long in this oppression, That all the world will see and laugh to scorne. The former triumphes of our mightines, In this obscure infernall seruitude? Bai. O life more loathsome to my vexed thoughts, Than noisome parbreak of the Stygian Snakes, Which fils the nookes of Hell with standing aire, Infecting all the Ghosts with curelesse griefs: O dreary Engines of my loathed sight, That sees my crowne, my honor and my name, Thrust vnder yoke and thraldom of a thiefe. Why feed ye still on daies accursed beams, And sink not quite into my tortur'd soule. You see my wife, my Queene and Emperesse, Brought vp and propped by the hand of fame, Queen of fifteene contributory Queens, Now throwen to roomes of blacke abiection, Smear'd with blots of basest drudgery: And Uillanesse to shame, disdaine, and misery: Accursed Baiazeth, whose words of ruth, That would with pity chear zabinas heart: And make our soules resolue in ceasles teares, Sharp hunger bites vpon and gripes the root: From whence the issues of my thoughts doe breake, O poore zabina, O my Queen, my Queen, Fetch me some water for my burning breast, To coole and comfort me with longer date, That in the shortned sequel of my life, I may poure foorth my soule into thine armes, With words of loue: whose moaning entercourse Hath hetherto bin staid, with wrath and hate Of our expresiesse band inflictions: zab. Sweet Baiazeth, I will prolong thy life, As long as any blood or sparke of breath Can quench or coole the torments of my griefe. She goes out: Bai. Now Baiazeth, abridge thy banefull daies, And beat thy braines out of thy conquer'd head: Since other meanes are all forbidden me, That may be ministers of my decay. O highest Lamp of euerliuing Ioue, Accursed day infected with my griefs, Hide now thy stained face in endles night, And shut the windowes of the lightsome heauens, Let vgly darknesse with her rusty coach Engyrt with tempests wrapt in pitchy clouds, Smother the earth with neuer fading mistes: And let her horses from their nostrels breathe Rebellious winds and dreadfull thunderclaps: That in this terrour tamburlaine may liue. And my pin'd soule resolu'd in liquid ay, May styl excruciat his tormented thoughts. Than let the stony dart of sencelesse colde, Pierce through the center of my withered heart, And make a passage for my loathed life. He brains himself against the cage. Enter Zabina. zab. What do mine eies behold, my husband dead? His Skul al riuin in twain, his braines dasht out? The braines of Baiazeth, my Lord and Soueraigne? O Baiazeth, my husband and my Lord, O Baiazet, O Turk, O Emperor, giue him his liquor Not I, bring milk and fire, and my blood I bring him againe, teare me in peeces, giue me the sworde with a ball of wildefire vpon it. Downe with him, downe with him. Goe to my child, away, away, away. Ah, saue that Infant, saue him, saue him. I, euen I speake to her, the Sun was downe. Streamers white. Red, Blacke, here here, here. Fling the meat in his face. Tamburlaine, tamburlaine, Let the souldiers be buried. Hel, death, tamburlain, Hell, make ready my Coch, my chaire, my iewels, I come, I come, I come. She runs against the Cage and braines her selfe Zenocrate wyth Anippe, Wretched Zenocrate, that liuest to see, Damascus walles di'd with Egytian blood. Thy Fathers subiects and thy countrimen: Thy streetes strowed with disseuered iointes of men, And wounded bodies gasping yet for life. But most accurst, to see the Sun-bright troope Of heauenly vyrgins and vnspotted maides, Whose lookes might make the angry God of armes, To breake his sword, and mildly treat of loue, On horsmens Lances to be hoisted vp, And guiltlesly endure a cruell death. For euery fell and stout Tartarian Stead, That stampt on others with their thundring hooues When al their riders chardg'd their quiuering speares Began to checke the ground, and rain themselues: Gazing vpon the beautie of their lookes: Ah Tamburlaine, wert thou the cause of this That tearm'st Zenocrate thy dearest loue? Whose liues were dearer to Zenocrate Than her owne life, or ought saue thine owne loue. But see another bloody spectacle. Ah wretched eies, the enemies of my hart, How are ye glutted with these grieuous obiects, And tell my soule mor tales of bleeding ruth? See, se Anippe if they breathe or no. Anip. No breath nor sence, nor motion in them both Ah Madam, this their slauery hath Enforc'd, And ruthlesse cruelty of Tamburlaine. Zen. Earth cast vp fountaines from thy entralles, And wet thy cheeks for their vntimely deathes: Shake with their waight in signe of feare &amp; griefe: Blush heauen, that gaue them honor at their birth, And let them die a death so barbarous. Those that are proud of fickle Empery, And place their chiefest good in earthly pompe: Behold the Turke and his great Emperesse. Ah tamburlaine, my loue, sweet tamburlaine, That fights for Scepters and for slippery crownes, Behold the Turk and his great Emperesse, Thou that in conduct of thy happy stars, Sleep'st euery night with conquest on thy browes, And yet wouldst shun the wauering turnes of war, In feare and feeling of the like distresse, Behold the Turke and his great Emperesse. Ah myghty Ioue and holy Mahomet, Pardon my Loue, oh pardon his contempt, Of earthly fortune, and respect of pitie, And let not conquest ruthlesly pursewde Be equally against his life incenst, In this great Turk and haplesse Emperesse. And pardon me that was not moou'd with ruthe, To see them liue so long in misery: Ah what may chance to thee zenocrate? Anip, Madam content your self and be resolu'd, Your Loue hath fortune so at his command, That she shall stay and turne her wheele no more, As long as life maintaines his mighty arme, That fights for honor to adorne your head. Enter a Messenger. Zen. What other heauie news now brings Philemus? Phi. Madam, your father and th'Arabian king, The first affecter of your excellence, Comes now as Turnus gainst Eneas did. Armed with lance into the Egyptian fields, Ready for battaile gainst my Lord the King. Zen. Now shame and duty, loue and feare presents A thousand sorrowes to my martyred soule: Whom should I wish the fatall victory, When my poore pleasures are deuided thus, And rackt by dutie from my cursed heart: My father and my first betrothed loue, Must fight against my life and present loue: Wherin the change I vse condemns my faith, And makes my deeds infamous through the world. But as the Gods to end the Troyans toile, Preuented Turnus of Lauinia. And fatally enricht Eneas loue. So for a finall Issue to my griefes, To pacifie my countrie and my loue, Must Tamburlaine by their resistlesse powers, With vertue of a gentle victorie, Conclude a league of honor to my hope, Then as the powers deuine haue preordainde, With happy safty of my fathers life, Send like defence of faire Arabia. They sound to the battaile. And Tamburlaine enioyes the victory, after Arabia enters wounded. Ar. What cursed power guides the murthering hands, Of this infamous Tyrants souldiers. That no escape may saue their enemies: Nor fortune keep them selues from victory. Lye down Arabia, wounded to the death, And let Zenocrates faire eies beholde That as for her thou bearst these wretched armes. Euen so for her thou diest in these armes: Leauing thy blood for witnesse of thy loue. zen. Too deare a witnesse for such loue my Lord, Behold Zenocrate, the cursed obiect Whose Fortunes neuer mastered her griefs: Behold her wounded in conceit for thee, As much as thy faire body is for me. Ar. Then shal I die with full contented heart, Hauing beheld deuine Zenocrate, Whose sight with ioy would take away my life, As now it bringeth sweetnesse to my wound, If I had not bin wounded as I am. Ah that the deadly panges I suffer now, Would lend an howers license to my tongue: To make discourse of some sweet accidents Haue chanc'd thy merits in this worthles bondage. And that I might be priuy to the state, Of thy deseru'd contentment and thy loue: But making now a vertue of thy sight, To driue all sorrow from my fainting soule: Since Death denies me further cause of ioy. Depriu'd of care, my heart with comfort dies. Since thy desired hand shall close mine eies. Enter Tamburlain leading the Souldane, Techelles, Theridamas, Vsumeasane, withothers. Tam. Come happy Father of Zenocrate, A title higher than thy Souldans name: Though my right hand haue thus enthralled thee Thy princely daughter here shall set thee free. She that hath calmde the furie of my sword. Which had ere this bin bathde in streames of blood, As vast and deep as Euphrates or Nile. Zen: O sight thrice welcome to my ioiful soule. To see the king my Father issue safe, From dangerous battel of my conquering Loue. Soul. Wel met my only deare Zenocrate, Though with the losse of Egypt and my Crown, tam. Twas I my lord that gat the victory, And therfore grieue not at your ouerthrow. Since I shall render all into your hands. And ad more strength to your dominions Then euer yet confirm'd th'Egyptian Crown. The God of war resignes his roume to me, Meaning to make me Generall of the world, Ioue viewing me in armes, lookes pale and wan, Fearing my power should pull him from his throne. Where ere I come the fatall sisters sweat, And griesly death by running to and fro, To doo their ceassles homag to my sword: And here in Affrick where it seldom raines, Since I arriu'd with my triumphat hoste, Haue swelling cloudes drawen from wide gasping woundes. Bene oft resolu'd in bloody purple showers, A meteor that might terrify the earth, And make it quake at euery drop it drinks: Millions of soules sit on the bankes of Styx, Waiting the back returne of Charons boat, Hell and Elisian swarme with ghosts of men, That I haue sent from sundry foughten fields. To spread my fame through hell and vp to heauen: And see my Lord, a sight of strange import, Emperours and kings lie breathlesse at my feet, The Turk and his great Emperesse as it seems, Left to themselues while we were at the fight. Haue desperatly dispatcht their slauish liues: With them Arabia too hath left his life, Al sights of power to grace my victory: And such are obiects fit for Tamburlaine. Wherein as in a mirrour may be seene, His honor, that consists in sheading blood, When men presume to manage armes with him. Soul. Mighty hath God &amp; Mahomet made thy hand (Renowmed tamburlain) to whom all kings Of force must yeeld their crownes and Emperies, And I am pleasde with this my ouerthrow: If as beseemes a person of thy state, Thou hast with honor vsde Zenocrate. tamb. Her state and person wants no pomp you see, And for all blot of foule inchastity, I record heauen, her heauenly selfe is cleare: Then let me find no further time to grace Her princely Temples with the Persean crowne: But here these kings that on my fortunes wait: And haue bene crown'd for prooued worthynesse, Euen by this hand that shall establish them, Shal now, adioining al their hands with mine, Inuest her here my Queene of Persea, What saith the noble Souldane and Zenocrate? Soul. I yeeld with thanks and protestations Of endlesse honor to thee for her loue. Tamb. Then doubt I not but faire Zenocrate Will soone consent to satisfy vs both. Zen. Els should I much forget my self, my Lord, Ther. Then let vs set the crowne vpon her head, That long hath lingred for so high a seat. Tech. My hand is ready to performe the deed, For now her mariage time shall worke vs rest: Vsum. And her's the crown my Lord, help set it on Tam. Then sit thou downe diuine Zenocrate, And here we crowne thee Queene of Persea, And all the kingdomes and dominions That late the power of Tamburlaine subdewed: As Iuno, when the Giants were supprest, That darted mountaines at her brother Ioue: So lookes my Loue, shadowing in her browes Triumphes and Trophees for my victories: Or as Latonas daughter bent to armes, Adding more courage to my conquering mind, To gratify the sweet zenocrate, Egyptians, Moores and men of Asia, From Barbary vnto the Westerne Indie, Shall pay a yearly tribute to thy Syre. And from the boundes of Affrick to the banks Of Ganges, shall his mighty arme extend. And now my Lords and louing followers, That purchac'd kingdomes by your matiall deeds, Cast off your armor, put on scarlet roabes. Mount vp your royall places of estate, Enuironed with troopes of noble men, And there make lawes to rule your prouinces: Hang vp your weapons on Alcides poste, For Tamburlaine takes truce with al the world. Thy first betrothed, Loue Arabia, Shall we with honor (as beseemes) entombe, With this great Turke and his faire Emperesse: Then after all these solemne Exequies, We wil our celebrated rites of mariage solemnize. Finis Actus quinti &amp; vltimi huius primÃ¦ partis.</field>
