      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âA street in Pella. (Enter Dymas and Meges.) Dymas. Assure thyself of this,âDemetrius Will never,âand I'll give thee reasons for't,â Sit on his father's throne. Meges. But is he not The idol of the people, and the . . . Dymas. Pshaw! You were the people's idolâso were Iâ So any slave, that look'd to wear the crownâ So Cerberus himself, if his foul paws Were clambering up the throne. Meges. But of the troops He is as much belovedâ Dymas. The troops?âOh yesâ They think he'll be their paymaster: no doubt They love him fiercely,âand would charge hell-gate If he but winked that way, to prove their love. But so they will for Perseus, finding him The treasure-holder; and with love as fierce To pleasure him, would cut Demetrius Into invisible atoms. Meges. But the king Loves young Demetrius better. Dymas. Not a jot! Kings have no natural love. He hates them both. He never loved aught, save his concubines, Each for a week or so.âHe loves himself,â And power, and what supports his power; and hates All that might wrest it from him:âof all men, That man he hates, who, in expectance, sits Upon his throne, and counts the lingering years Till the bright crown and sceptre shall change hands. Meges. Then his birth Is of a wedded wife; while Perseus Springs from a lawless bed. Dymas. Tush!âlawless bed! Will that make dull the sword that Perseus hires? Or when he pays his soldiers, will the coin Be worse, or better, that the head it bears Is bastard, or legitimate? Mark me now: Demetrius is of heedless, open soul; Calls things by their right names,âand speaks his mind On all occasions frankly; tells a knave He is not virtuous;âpraises a good deed, Tho' done by one on whom the king hath frowned; Speaks openly of whom he likes, or hates; Cares not t'offend, so he but take offence, Whoever be the mark on't: and, with this, He hath a haughtiness he brought from Rome,â Whose flatterers blew him up to high conceit Of his own excellence, that will gender hate In all he shews it on. Meges. But there again,â Will not the Romansâ Dymas. Pray you, give me leaveâ I'll hear you speak anon. You know me well To be your friend;âyou know meâdo you not? Meges. In truth I've thought you such. Dymas. Be sure I am. And what I'd move you to, is your own good; Nought to my profit. That Demetrius Can never fill the throne, is to my mind As palpable as is the earth we tread. If you then to his fortunes tie yourself, His fall will drag you down.âWhy, leave him then, And pay your court to Perseus, in whose shine You shall be glorious. You've example for't; Each day some favourer of Demetrius comes To stand on Perseus' side: they see the cloud Peeping above the hills,âand hear the wind That soon shall blow a storm; and so they run To speedy shelter under Perseus' roof; Where you must haste too, or abide its rage;â And that would grieve me. But I know you wiseâ Delay no moment,âcome along with me;â I'll show you to the prince, andâ Meges. Stay awhile. That you do mean me well, I will not doubtâ Dymas. Be sure I do. Meges. But yet you counsel ill. Dymas. Make that appear, and I'll come o'er to you. Meges. Then, first, Demetrius has the people's love. Dymas. Ay! for a week,âor four-and-twenty hours. I've answered that before. Meges. The army's tooâ Dymas. Till Perseus shake the goldâI show'd that also. Meges. And, of a surety, Philip loves him best; However you deny it: and, his birth Being legitimateâ Dymas. Nay, nay;âall this Is, like a last year's story, proved a lie. If you have nothing else but chaff like this, One breath will scatter it. Meges. But hear me, then. What's Philip's will, or what the people's love, The army's too,âtho' all were on your side,â Opposed to haughty Rome? Demetrius Is loved at Rome, where Philip is despised, And Perseus hated:âand, rest sure of thisâ Rome will have whom she chooses king, or none. Look here (showing a letter), I know that Perseus, in his wiles, Is tortuous as a serpent; in revenge, Cool and unhesitating; and goes on Right to his mark, tho' o'er his father's neck He tread to reach it:âbut, to strive 'gainst Rome, He lacks the lion's daring, and his strengthâ Which would far better stead him. . . . Well, sirânow What think you of it? Dymas. Lend me this scroll, To use as I think fit,âand your fond hopes For poor Demetrius are not worth a straw:â This, shown to Philip, will incense him so That he'll give instant order for his death, Or banishment,âor use such other means, That the reversion of Demetrius' crown Were, at a drachm, too dear. Meges. If that were sureâ Dymas. 'Tis sure as Fate. You owe Demetrius noughtâ Let him go down at once: why should you drown To help a man that cannot keep afloat? What hath he done for you? Meges. Why, that's most trueâ Yet he's a noble and frank-hearted princeâ And, if he should succeedâ Dymas. Ifâifâwhy if? The man that builds his fortunes on that if Might, for his wisdom, go to batter down A bulwark'd town with pebbles. Come along; The king is now in court: he hears to-day Th' ambassadors from Rome. You'll see anon On what a ticklish base Demetrius stands; And how firm-rooted Perseus. As we go, I'll give you farther reasonsâ Meges. Which I'll weigh; And afterwards resolve on. Dymas. Let's despatch, For the morn wears. [Exeunt. Scene II. âA Room of State in Philip's Palace. Philip sits on his throne, surrounded by Perseus, Demetrius, Antigonus, Dymas, and other Lords. Marcius and Cecilius, the Roman Ambassadors, stand together and somewhat apart from the rest. Marcius. Here, Philip, we conclude. Rome will not stand An idle looker-on, while her allies Are trampled under foot.âYou know her will:â Recall your forces from Bithynia,â Your garrisons from every Thracian fort;â And, nor by open, nor by covert means, Oppress her friends, or aid her enemiesâ Then Rome remains at peace. If you refuse, She bids you think of CynocephalÃ¦; And tells you, the good swords that conquered there Have not been blunted. Think upon't we pray you: And so we take our leave.âPhilip, farewell. (Going.) Philip. Stay, Marcius and Cecilius;âwe have thought: And you shall bear our answer. Rome's commands Shall be obeyed. Would they had been more just! Or we more strong to cross them!âBut, to Heaven We trust th' event!âTell it to haughty Rome, Philip forgets not CynocephalÃ¦,â But Rome forgets her greatness, when she stoops To listen every pitiful complaint That comes 'gainst Philip.âAnd, with this, my lords, We do dismiss you. Cecilius. As your truest friends, We caution you to such a course in this, That in broad day your deeds may bear the eye That pries the closest. Philip. Thank you for your pains. Marcius. And, to your private ear, I'd whisper this. When Philip needs ambassadors to Rome, Whom he'd have listened to,âhe would do well Sending his son Demetrius. So adieu. Cecilius. Philip, adieu. Marcius and Cecilius. Lords, all of you farewell. Macedonian Lords. Farewell. Demetrius. Marcius,âa word with you. [Exeunt Demetrius and Roman Ambassadors. Philip (descending hastily from his throne). Insufferable arrogance!âProud Romeâ Look to thyself erelongâthou den of thieves! For I will strike thee yet,âor lower fall.â Bearded upon my throne!âand not a hand To strike the upstarts down!âDemetriusâ Where is the Roman minion?â Perseus. Sir, my brother, Your duteous and right loyal son . . . Philip. Speak onâ A forthright tale,âthou everlasting sneerer. Whate'er Demetrius be,âthou art his mate In all his worst.âRecall my garrisons! Give up my fortresses! Deny my aid To my oldest friends!âand threatened on my throne By fellows such as I can tread upon Each hour i' th' day! Which of you witnessed this? Perseus and several Lords. We all, my liege, beheld it. Philip. Loyal souls! (To Perseus) What youâour eldest son, and heir to the throne, You heard,âand saw,âand had nor tongue nor hand, To tame their insolence;ânot even an eye That dared to wink reproof.âAnd you sir, tooâ And youâand youâand, old Antigonus, youâ Antig. Philip, reprove me not, for I can showâ Philip. Peace! on thy life, old man! I'll hear no prating. Where is Demetrius?âBring him to my sight. Better a beggar freeâthan fettered king! But Rome shall echo yet to Philip's shout,â And her grave senators shall duck the head To Philip's veriest slaves;âand her proud dames Shall wait on Philip's concubines.âOh Gods! Let me have vengeanceâfullâfullâfull to the brim. Vengeance,âlet me have vengeance.âCarthage will aid, And Sicilyâand many Grecian states, That hate the Roman, while they hug him hardâ And goldâand golden promisesâhaâhaâ I'll fee them wellâI'llâ (Enter Demetrius.) Antig. (to Dem.). He's incensed to the height,â Do not speak to him now. Demetrius. Nay, give me leave: I'm guiltless,âtherefore bold. Behold me, father; You summoned meâI haste at your command. Philip. They say, from HÃ¦mus, all th' Italian plains Lie like a map.âThe war shall try new fields. I'll fight no more, like to a baited beast, In my own den,âthe lion shall go forth. For Italyâfor Italy!â (To Dem.) Oh sirâ I crave your pardon that I saw you not: We missed you from the presence. Please you, prince, If so an old and humbled king may crave Of his young, haughty son, Rome's favouriteâ Why went you hence with Marcius, even now? With Marcius, who had held his finger up, In impudent rebuke to your throned sire, And school'd him like a boy?âWas't well? Was't well? Dem. I knew not, father, that he uttered more Than, as the Senate's organ, he was bid: In doing which he had no greater guilt Than the mute parchment that upon it bears The words of mortal quarrel. For myself . . . Philip. Despatch!âFew words, and weightier matter, sir. Dem. I did but beg that Marcius, reaching Rome, Would to some dearest friends remember me. Philip. Ayâay!âThy dearest friendsâand our worst foes! Look to't, Demetrius!âHe's no friend of mine That's linked to my black enemy. Look to't! I say look to't!âFoul whispers are abroadâ Dem. If any whisper that Demetrius In anything's disloyal to his king, Or to his country,âhere Demetrius says, And loudly, he's a villain that so whispers,â A liar, and a coward! Philip. Wordsâbrave words!â Dem. Which with my sword I gladly will maintain On him who dares dispute them. Philip. Boast no more Of what you'll do,âbut look your course be clear. Sharp eyes are on you. There's the taint of Rome Upon your very brow,âyour gait,âyour speech;â Your every motion is Rome-spotted, prince. Dem. Till, at some happier moment, I may plead To him who is at once my judge and father; And set forth truly all my love to him, And to my country,ânow a vain attempt, In this assembly, where stand counsellors Who have poured poison in that father's ear Against his son,âfor which forgive them, Heaven!â Humbly I take my leave. [Exeunt Demetrius and Lords of his party. Perseus. Thy humbleness Is prouder than another's arrogance. Philip. Oh! for one moment to stand up in Rome Her victorâbut one moment!âall that's yet Of life to come, I'd toss away unprized For that one instant!âseeâand hearâand die! (Enter Lysius.) Lysius. Health unto Philip! To his arms success! Philip. Philip returns thy greeting. By thy mien, And free discourse, some prince I hold thee, youth: Please you go on. Lysius. To Philip, the great king, The strong BastarnÃ¦ proffer amity, And close alliance. Philip's wars be theirs,â And theirs be Philip's.âFor a farther tie, A princess of the royal blood I bring,â My sisterâfor my name is Lysius,â Whom, so he please, to one of Philip's sons I give in marriage. Philip. And in happy hour Thou com'st, young prince. This amity I hail, And straight will seal the bond. And, for the maid Thy sister, she already is my child; For, with a fond contention, my two sons Will strive who wins her first. For thee, young Lysius, Come to my arms, and let me call thee son. Thy fame hath gone before thee. Lysius. Royal sir,â You bend me with the burthen of your love. Permit me, I beseech you, to haste now, And with this joyful news to bless the ear Of my loved sister, who . . . Philip. Nayâgo at once, And bring her to me, that upon her cheek I may bestow a father's blessing kiss, And show her to my sons. Stand on no form. Lysius. Your majesty will bind me ever yours. I take my leave. Philip. What forces now in field? Are your horse numerous?âand your infantry,â How stand they for the push, dear Lysiusâha? Lysius. Full thirty thousand are our foot, pick'd men; Our horse ten thousand. Never better steeds Gallop'd o'er battle-field. Philip. Dear Lysius, haste. Bring me my future daughter to my arms. Ten thousand horse,âand thirty thousand footâ Said you not so? Lysius. Even so. Philip. Picked menâstrong steedsâ Hasteâhaste, dear Lysius, haste.âYet, stay awhile, We hold, to-day, a solemn festival; The rites performed,âour army in review Passes before us:âafter that, divides Into two bodies, each beneath the lead Of Perseus, or Demetrius, our two sons,â And so, in friendly strife, mock battle wages With blunted weapons. There thy sister bring; Where she shall see our royal sons contend, And take her choice of them. Lysius. I haste to her. [Exit. Philip. Ten thousand horse,âand thrice ten thousand foot! What, lords,âall mute?âIs there no tongue let loose For joy of such a fortune?â'Tis at Rome This should be heard in silence. Perseus. Royal sir! Our hopes are by our fears for-ever checked: From foreign aids we cannot so much hope, As from domestic enemies we fear. Philip. What is't you mean? Perseus. We in our bosoms hold, If not a traitor, yet at least a spy. The Romans, since he was a hostage there, Have sent his body back,âbut keep his heart. On him the Macedonians fix their eyes, Persuaded that they never shall have king, Save him that Rome shall choose. Philip. I like not this! But I see through you. For my throne and power Ye are contending, ere I give them up: And each of you would deal his brother death, To make succession sure.âIn time beware; Lest, in my wrath, I sweep you both away, And choose a stranger heir. Perseus. So please you read This letter: then condemn me if, too soon, I call Demetrius spy. Philip (reading at intervals aloud). âAnd, moreover, I can satisfy youâââPhilip suspectedââha! ha!âhe will give you cause anon, âPerseus hated by the Senateâââthe determination that Demetrius shall succeedââIndeed! indeed! âFor, if Philip should again compel Rome to war, his throne will be declared forfeit.â (Folds up the letter.) Ha! shall it so?âHow say you,âforfeited? Is Rome become the mansion of the Gods? What think you lords? Have they the Thunderer's bolts Stored in their Capitol?âYes, sure! and we Must go and do them humble reverence. On his old knees your king must humbly bend, And beg his fate and yours of godlike Rome.â Yesâyesâit shall be so:âand, for more pomp Of worship, with our golden armour on Will we our lowly pilgrimage begin:â And in Rome's temples will we offer up Rich sacrifice:âeach soldier shall be priest, And his sharp sword the knife of sacrifice!â Oh Gods! immortal Gods!âwhat a rich steam Of bloody incense shall your nostrils quaff! Take back your letter, sir.âDemetrius king? Soâso.âThis eaglet would soar up betimes; He shall fly lower,âor his wings I'll break, And hurl him to the earth. (Enter a Messenger.) Speak out at once Thy business, and begone. Messenger. My gracious liege! From Marcius I am come, who, in his haste,â For which he craves forgivenessâtook not thought Of that wherewith he was intrusted to youâ This packet. Philip. Whence?âfrom Rome? Messenger. From Titus Quintius. Philip. Go now. [Exit Mess. What have we here? âFrom Titus Quintius To Philip, King of Macedon.ââProud worm! Titus to Jupiter were next.âThese knaves Think kings and deities their playfellows; And men the baubles only for their sport. (He reads in silence.) Dymas (to 1st Lord). There's wormwood there. Look how he bites his lip. 1st Lord. Will it be war? Dymas. Not yet. We must not stir Till we be stronger; or Rome lose her strength. 1st Lord. He's pale with rage. Philip (stamping furiously). Damnation!â'Tis too much! Perseus. What ill afflicts my father? Philip. Look you here.â But no! I trust you not. My sons are traitors. I'll take no counsel; but I'll have revenge:â I'll have revenge, and deep.âPerseus, the troops By this are in the field. Betake you thither; And whisper in the ears of all your friends That they to-day must do their best. Remember The princess sees you: and I'd have you win her;â But you must toil for't.âWhen the tourney's done, To him that best delights her, she shall send Her ring,âor other token that her choice Fixes on him. And 'tis an honour, prince, Worthy your striving for.âThe trumpetsâhark! Let us away.âRide thou at my right hand; So shall be seen how in thy father's sight Thou art held worthiest. Perseus. Prouder so to be Than sitting on the throne of Macedon! Philip. Too flowery, prince! No more! Antigonus! After the tourney come to me again. Thoughts are within me that to deeds must grow, Such as the weak will start at. But the act By the strange time is fashioned. Strongest kings, No more than weakest hinds, their way can hold Direct to th' point,âand do but what they would. A seeming crime makes oft a real goodâ The guilt is Fate'sâforced on usâbut our own The good that follows it. But now no more. Lords, to the field,âwe meet again anon. Lords. Our humblest duties to your majesty. [Exeunt King and Lords on opposite sides. Antigonus. What dreadful thing is brooding in thee now, That needs this dark concealment? Crime enough, Fate's, or thine own, already hast thou dared: Yet doubtful still the after coming goodâ If evil not the rather. Doctrine false! And policy most foul and dangerous, That wickedly would seek to work forth good! Soundness, from rottenness, doth never grow; Nor, from distemper, health. From evil, good As little can be born. Beware, O king! Lest the fair seeming path beneath thy feet Do gape, and in a fathomless abyss Headlong precipitate thee,âwise too late! [Exit. Scene III. âA Plain. (Shouts heard from a distance; alarums, and the clattering of arms.) (Enter Lysius and Janira.) Lysius. Stand here, Janira: they'll not pass this way. Janira. Oh brother! Is it not a splendid sight? Lysius. Yes,âfor a mimicry.âLookâlook!âthey fly! Perseus the first to run;âDemetrius The foremost to pursue. By Jupiter! It waxes almost to a real strife,â Wanting but real weapons. Janira. Glorious youth! How beautiful he looks! Lysius. Ha! seeâthe king Makes signal to desistâ (Shouts are heard.) Janira. How rapidly The storm is hushed!âI saw Demetrius, With arm uplifted for a sudden blow,â Yet, on the instant, did he check himself, And let his sword fall dead. Lysius. He seems incensed. Janira. Dear brother,âto Demetrius bear my ring: He must my husband be,âor I'll have none. Lysius. The king's against him. If you'd wear a crown Send me to Perseus. Janira. Were that crown more rich Than Jove's own diadem of living light, With Perseus I'd not share it. Scarce a word, A look with each I've changed,âyet inly feel That life with one were bliss,âwith th' other woe. Lysius. So fixed? Jan. Even so. Whether for good, or ill, My lot is cast! Lysius. Then will I bear your ring. [Exit. Jan. One hath my love,âthe other my contempt,â Almost my hatred. Is not this a fault? I know not that;âbut 'twere, I'm sure, a fault To give my heart to one; my hand to th' other. He has received the ring.âHe kisses itâ He comesâOh heavens! what shall I say? (Enter Demetrius and Lysius.) Dem. (kneeling). Bright princess! When the sun shines upon us, then we bless His cheering beams,âas now your dearer rays I worship, that have cast a golden light, Where darkness was before,âin this poor heart. Jan. Nay, princeâthis glittering flattery . . . Dem. 'Tis truth! Jan. Bespeaks more show than worth. Dem. By heavens 'tis truth! Jan. By heavens 'tis flattery! How can you love What, till a few hours past, you had not seen? There is no reason in such love methinks. Dem. Oh! ask me not a reason why I love: Ask why I like the perfume of the rose;â The singing of the pensive nightingale;â Ask why the gorgeous canopy of Heaven Is glorious to my eyes;âor the great voice Of the vast ocean music to my ears;â I cannot tell you:âneither can I tell Why I do love you:âyet I so do love That, to express it, I can find no words But what seem laboured, forced,âbeyond the markâ Yet are, indeed, far tamer than my thoughts. I pray you deem me not that worthless thing, A common flatterer. Jan. You make amends. But pray you rise, for frowning looks are on us. The king and Perseus stand in talk together, And we're the matter of it.âPray you, sir. Dem. First on that hand let me a kiss impress, And seal it mine,âthusâthus.âNow, king or prince May smile or frown, 'tis one. (He rises.) Lysius. The king comes here. Let's meet him. Jan. But his face, methinks, is dark. Dem. Midnight itself would brighten like the morn, Shone on by thee. Come on,âand have no fear. [Exeunt. Scene IV. âA room in the Palace. (Enter Philip and Antigonus.) Philip. It matters littleâshe hath made her choiceâ Nor will I cross it. Listen to me now. Antig. Most anxiously do I your words attend. Philip. The axe hath felled the old and gnarlÃ«d trunk: But there are shoots, that soon will grow to trees As poisonous as the first. They must be cared for. Antig. What means your majesty? Philip. That Philip's throne Shall not be a mere stool for Rome to raise, Or kick down at her pleasure.âMark this man; This haughty Titus. My own son he sets My opposite;ârash fool! my prudence lauds In that I sent this flashy boy to Rome, Ambassador;âsays, roundly, that, to him Was granted what, to me, had been refused,â So much the Senate loved him! Yes, by Heaven! And then exhorts me, as a friendâa friend! Oh! ye great Gods! for every friend like this Give me a keen sword, and a giant's arm!â As my true friend exhorts me, once again To send Demetrius, with a larger train Of nobles and ambassadors, to Rome;â Who may our present troubles set at rest, And spare a war mightâhell and furies!âend With forfeit of my empire!â Antig. Dares he so? Philip. 'Tis written here;âand written on my heart, In letters all of fire. But, mark me now. Against the pride and tyranny of Rome To my last gasp I'll fight:âher foes my friends; Her friends my foes. All natural ties I'll break Rather than this new bond. Were my right hand Grown friend to Rome, I'd have it hewn away.â AntigonusâDemetrius loves you well. Antig. I think he doth. Philip. Advise him;âcaution him:â He is my son;âbutâif I prove him falseâ I'll crush him like an adder. Antig. Good my liege! Philip. By the Eternal Deities I'll do it! For less I love my sons, my crown, my life, Than I hate Rome, and every friend of Rome. Antig. Your ear is poisoned 'gainst a noble son, Who loves you well, and is right true and faithful. My life upon his loyalty! Philip. Enough! Heaven grant he prove so!âMeantime, that the bed Where treasons spring, may not o'er-rank become, I'll have it weeded.âWhen my just decree Brought to the death those traitors, I yet left, In foolish pity, their young rebel broods:â And they are now eternal orators, Pleading against me their false fathers' deaths, When rather, for their own lives,âforfeited, Yet spared,âshould their hourly thanks be mine. I'll play the fool no longer:âthey shall die.â Antig. My gracious liegeâI pray you . . . Philip. Peaceâold man!â I'll have no tiger-cubs, for their smooth skins, And pretty playful tricks, preserved and reared Till the grown monsters turn and rend their rearerâ They shall not live!âI've said it. Antig. Philipâpauseâ Philip. Old man! I will not hear thee. They shall die! Give order for'tâand presently. Antig. No! never! I say't again,âI will not lend my breath To such foul guilt! Nay, more,âwhile I can speak, I'll tell it to the world,âand point at thee,â And call thee monster! Yea, by Jove I will! Rave as thou mayst! Philip. Art thou gone mad?âHence!âfly! Lest I forget thy grey hairs and long toils. Antig. Forget them all, when thou thyself forget'st To wade again in blood. Philip. Thou prating fool! If I stay longer thine may be the first. Awayâaway!âI would not take thy life. Speak not a wordâor I may turn againâ Thou foolish dotard! [Exit Philip. Antig. Thou unhappyâking! [Exit. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âA garden belonging to the Palace of Antigonus. (Enter Janira and Archo.) Jan. 'Tis late i' th' morn I think. The dew's all gone. Archo. The sun has risen this hour. Jan. Demetrius said He'd meet me here by sunrise; and then ride Among the mountains to enjoy the morning. 'Tis his first promise,âyet he keeps it not. Archo. Heaven bless you, madam! don't believe a word Of what he promises. A lover's word Is less than nothing, for his oaths are nothing. (Demetrius enters behind.) Why they will swear by all the eternal Gods, That you are lovelier than a nymph o' th' woods; That violets are poison to your breath;â ThatâI have heard them say itâ Jan. What,âto thee? Archo. To me? Why not to me? To me they've said it; And to a million, and a million more:â That your sweet eyes are bluer than the skyâ When they, perhaps, are jaundiced;âthat your skin Is smooth as marble,âpurer than fresh snow,â Tho' it, in truth, be dingy, freckled, rough:â They'll swearâI know not what they'll swear;âand may, Ere I again believe them. Jan. Prithee, peace! I did not think thou'dst been so forward, girl. Demetrius would not swear, or say, I'm sure, Other than truth,âor,âif I thought he wouldâ I'd . . . Dem. What, Janira? Jan. Tear him from my heart. Dem. Stay till you find him false. But, my sweet love, No more of this. And let not this light wench Sully your better thoughts of holy love. Pure love is as a fire that shoots from Heaven Into the human heart;âwhere all that's gross, Selfish, or false,âit burns and melts away;â But all that's true, and generous, and pure,â That doth it brighten still, and glorify, Till the poor earthly breast becomes a shrine For thoughts and passions pure as those of Heaven! Jan. I do believe it. Dem. He who slanders love,â Hath never felt it:âwho calls woman false, Hath never been beloved:âwho rails at loversâ Hath never known, or not deservÃ«d one. Jan. My dear Demetrius!âBut, I pray you now, Why have you failed your promise?âI've been here This hour or more. Dem. In sooth my purest plea Is but a soiled one. (Enter Antigonus hastily.) Antig. Pardon me, fair lady. (Then to Demetrius) A word with you. Dem. A moment give me leave. Antig. The king demands your presence instantly. Three messengers upon each other's heels, Came breathless. Dem. What's the business?âsay it quick. Antig. One that, alas! will little pleasure you. What, last night, passed between you,âI know not: But Perseus to the king accuses you Of an intended fratricide.â Dem. Of what? Antig. That at the tournament you sought his life, Which he but saved by flight;âthat to your feast You asked him, there to stab, or poison himâ Dem. Oh Gods! is't possible?â Antig. That, failing so, You went unto his palace at dead night, Pretending jollity, and generous love,â But seeking murder.â Dem. Am I in a dream? Is this a brother?âOh Antigonus! I am aweary of this wretched life. Day after day some petty lie:âsome word, Dropt as by chance;âsome brotherly excuse, That is in truth, a slander;âsome head-shake;â Some half-checked sigh, as though the loving breast Groaned, to breathe forth my guilt;âall odious arts That cunning can devise, and malice act, Are practised to my ruin:âand, at last,â The crown of all,âthis bold and hellish charge Strikes at my life,âand from a brother's hand! Oh Gods! Jan. (coming forward). My dear Demetrius,âwhat's amiss? Dem. Nothing, Janira;ânothingânothing, love. Jan. Nay, say not that. Why strike upon your breast, And clench your hands, and . . . Dem. Listen to me, love. I must away unto the king. A charge Most black and false hath been against me brought; Which, like foul smoke, I can at once blow off;â But I must speak for't. Pray you stay not now. When I return I will unburthen all My griefs unto you; which will thus grow light. Go, and fear nothing. Jan. Dear Demetriusâ Lysius hath left me. Make no longer stay Than need demands;âand, pray you, think of me. Dem. Sweet love! I willâI will. [Exeunt Janira and Archo. Of fratricide? Antig. Were you at strife, my lord? Dem. At strife? Oh no! The mounting lark is not in merrier mood Than I last night. In sooth too merry mood. Antig. Whatâflushed with wine? Dem. Even so. Yet nothing more Than might th' occasion, and such friends excuse. I never had a humour less disposed To aught unkind:âbutâto a brother's death? Oh Heavens! Antig. That you are innocent, my lord, I'd pledge my life:âbut yet I hope your proofs Are such, would laugh at question;âfor the king Is stirred against you; and, when passion storms, The strongest reason's a weak citadel. Dem. Oh! when suspicion sits beside the scales, A thing too light to bow the snowdrop's head, Shall crack the beam. But let us to the king. You will plead for me when my words are vain: He'll lean to you. Antig. Yesâas a madman leans To him that would control him.âNever raged A fiercer madman than . . . Dem. Antigonus! Antig. Take not offence that I plain truth speak out. What are our passions, uncontrolled and fierce, But a mere madness?âYou are Philip's son,â Yet were as safe within your enemy's reach. He bids me warn you. Look, Demetriusâ Thus did he stamp his heel into the earth; And thus to crush you, like a venomous snake, Should he but prove you falseâswore horribly. Dem. So let him! Antig. Let him?âAy! and let him, too Put boys, and girls, and infants to the death, By hundreds! He's their king:âwhat claim have such To life, when Philip wills their death? Dem. What mean you? Antig. That you're not safe;âthat none of us are safe. Meâspite of my grey hairs, and years of toil, He has cast offâI heed not for myself,â But for my country. The wild beast is loosed; And I, who tamed him, trodden to the earth. Dem. I have heard nought of this. Antig. But yesterday,â Burning with fury against Rome, and all That favoured Rome,âand most against yourselfâ Dem. Alas! my father! Antig. To complete the crime Begun on those, whom his suspicious dread Sent,âfor their love to Rome,âto violent death, Upon their children he resolved to seize; Of age, or sex unheeding,âyesâby Heaven! Dem. Oh! say it not. Antig. âI'll weed this treason-bedâ âThey shall all dieââhe cries:ââgive order for itââ âI'll have no tiger-cubs, for their bright skins, âPreserved till the grown monsters tear their feeder. âGive order for their seizure:âthey shall die.â Dem. Oh! horrible! Antig. Even to his face I told him I would not do it. He went off in wrath; And threatening me. Yet would I not there cease; But to the palace, at the evening hour, Went to have speech with him. Dem. How sped you then? Antig. He would not hear me:âcalled me doting fool:â Bade me away,âand in my presence, signed The fatal mandate. Dem. Will he shed their blood? Antig. In sooth I fear it. Dem. Good Antigonus,â There is a lady whom, for all that's loved,â Beautyâand dignityâand heavenly graceâ All men might worship. Somewhat past her bloom, Even like the rose full blown,âshe yet hath charms Might tempt the sickliest taste:âyet not for these I love her, but for that fine majesty, And purity, and nobleness of soul, Which make her, more than woman, great and good; Yet leave all woman's best and loveliest gifts In all their tenderness. Antig. There is but one Upon whose head this diadem will sit,â The noble Theoxana. Dem. Even she.â When her brave husband to the scaffold went,â He was my friend; gay, strong, and beautiful. Oh! to my soul I loved him!âhis last words, Embracing me, were theseââProtect my wifeâ Protect my children.ââIn my soul I swore,â And have not failed them. Good Antigonus, Advise her instantly;âbid her depart Ere on her tender young the tiger spring.â Her means are ample,âand her spirit high. She needs not goldânor other aid than this Timely advisement. Not a moment lose, Or all may then be lost. I'll to the king, And trust my own defence. Adieu, dear friend. Antig. Dear prince, farewell. The time is sore diseased, And we must bleed for't.âEre the sun go down, My messenger shall bear the warning voice. Heaven guard her;âand you, prince, not less. Heed wellâ Snares are about you;âswords are bared against you,â And daggers in men's tongues. Jove shield you well! Dem. And thee, kind friend!âI have no fears. Adieu. [Exeunt at opposite sides. Scene II. âA room in the Palace. (Philip, seated upon the throne; with Lysimachus and Onomastes upon lower seats at either hand. Perseus and Demetrius stand on opposite sides, attended by their respective friends.) Onomastes. Under submission, my dread liege,âthus read,â And truth-like most it seems,âthe blacker stain Flies from the charge,âand leaves upon the prince No spot save such as . . . Philip. Truth-like may it seem, And yet be false as hell! Dem. 'Tis true as heaven! And the foul charge as foolish, as 'tis foul! My true offence is that I'm loved at Rome:â With this you taunt me, father; and call crime, What ought to be my glory. I sought not, Either as hostage, or ambassador, To be sent thither. When you gave command, I but obeyed;âand such my conduct there As, humbly do I hope, reflected not Upon yourself, your crown, or country, aught That honour censures. 'Tis yourself, my father, That have my friendship with the Romans caused: While you're at peace, that friendship will subsist: But, at the war's first signal, it will die, And I'll proclaim our enmity. Our love In peace was born, and cannot live in war. If, father, towards yourself I lack respect; Or, if against my brother . . . Philip. Stay,âenough! Who'd be a father, seeing sons like mine, That should be staffs whereon his age might lean, Turned into rods to bruise him!âBrothers? Asps! A false accuser this, or that a wretch Unfit to live, who would his brother's life Have taken from him! But I know you now. Upon my throne both turn your guilty eyes, And just so long would suffer me to live, That, by surviving one of you, I hold The crown for th' other . . . Dem. Never such a thought . . . Philip. Silence, presumptuous boy! May the king speak? Demetrius, and Perseus,ânot from words, Or from such hasty trial, will I pass On this affair my sentence, but from all Your other actions, small as well as great, And from your general carriage, which shall be O'erlooked with keenest scrutiny. Go now, And, if you can, in heart, as well as name, Be brothers. Perseus. I would be so. Dem. Would you were! [Exeunt, on opposite sides, Perseus and Demetrius, and their partisans. Philip. He's clear of this;âyet fouled with what is worse: His heart's a traitor, for it clings to Rome. Oh wretched Philip! cursed with sons like these!â My reverend friends, I thank you,âere the night I'll farther speak with you. As you pass hence, Bid the lord Dymas here. Onom. Our love and duty Are ever at your bidding. Lysim. And our prayers Are for your good success. Philip. Farewell. I thank you. [Exeunt Lysimachus and Onomastes. He shall not live, if I do prove him false. By heaven! I'd pluck my heart from out my breast, Could it conspire with Rome;âand shall my son Be dearer than the very seat of life? (Enter Dymas.) Come hither, Dymas. I believe thee true;â Single of heart,âand with no party leagued To warp thy judgment, or thy virtue taint. Dymas. Your majesty too deeply honours me. Philip. Not more than thy deserts. I have a task, That, for its proper execution, asks A pure and upright soul; a wary eye, Observing all things,âand a judgment ripe. These qualities are thine. Dymas. My gracious liege! Philip. Speak not; but hear me. For some certain end,â Not now to be disclosed,âI would make proof If, from the top of HÃ¦mus, all that stretch, Incredible, of prospect may be seen. 'Tis said, the Black Sea, and the Adriaticâ The Danube, and the cloud-surmounting Alps, And the vast, beauteous plains of Italy,â All lie within the scope of that hill's ken. Dymas. I've heard 'tis so, my liege. Philip. That will I prove: And, to that end, to-morrow shall set forth. With me goes Perseus; but Demetrius stays: Him to thy special charge do I consign. Watch every motion;âdive into his soul;â Hear his discourse;âand lead him on to speak His unrestricted mind;âand, when he halts, And looks suspicious,âthen do thou speak first, What he would seem to ponder.âWhen he grieves, Do thou be sorrowful;âand, when he laughs, Be thou his echo.âIf he talk of Rome, Do thou out-go him when he praises most: If of his brother, let his deepest hate Find thine yet deeper;âso his very heart Shall lie for us to read;âand, of his guilt, Or innocence, assured,âour future course Shall, with unhesitating step, be trod, Acquitting, or condemning. Dymas. My dread liege! The subject lives but in his monarch's smile:â And every sense and faculty he owns Is his but as an instrument to use In his great master's service.âYour command Truly will I obey:âyet in such fear, Knowing my weakness,âand this mighty task,â As that I'd gladly to some stronger back Have left the valued burthen. But 'tis mine; And I will labour in it. Philip. Be a spyâ Not a seducer. Tell the guilt thou seestâ But, make none.â'Tis a fearful trust thou hast: A prince's life,âa monarch's happiness, Lie in thy hand. If other than the truth Thy tongue shall tell:âif bribe, or party zeal,â Or any base advantage of thine own, Sway thee to falsehood,âthere's no plague in hell Horrid enough to pay thee.âLook well to't. Dymas. My gracious liege . . . Philip. No, no; I doubt thee not, I do but warn thee. On the strongest bridge We tread with caution when a gulf's below. Were I to doubt thee,âdoubt must quickly change To strong assurance. Monarchs do not toy With traitors, proved, or dreamed of. Fare thee wellâ Yet stay a moment.âLook thou leave not aught To uncertain memory, that may disguise, Or alter, or distort what once was plain.â Keep thou a tablet, where each word and deed, Fresh in thine ear, or eye, may be fixed down, For me to ponder on.âHe is my son: Heaven grant he prove not false!âAnd yet, if true, His truth makes Perseus false!âAccursÃ«d Rome! All is thy doing. Oh! Eternal Gods! Give but one hour of conquest; and, all else, Refuse me if you will. [Exit. Dymas. Demetriusâ Thy fate is in my hands; and thou must fall. I do not hate thee;ânay, I honor thee:â But, plucking thee from thy bright eminence, I may myself uplift even to that height From which thou fallest.âPower and honor call, And I must follow them. GoodâI would be;â Greatâmust be. So farewell Demetrius. I'll lead thee to the precipice's brow;â Philip shall hurl thee down. [Exit. Scene III. âAnother room in Philip's Palace. (Enter Perseus and a Servant.) Perseus. Ere Dymas leave the palace, bring him here, Haste, or you'll miss him. [Exit Servant. Let the fool be his!â I quarrel not with that. The crown's my bride; Or shall be,âelse my wooing shall be rough for't. (Enter Dymas.) Good-morrow, Dymas. Dymas. 'Tis to thee good-morrow, More than to me: yet may to both be good, So made good use of. Perseus. Answer me at once, What sudden journey's this, where I must go, Dangling among the train of the old king, Like some smart gewgaw?âAnd what conference Held he with you even now? Dymas. That journey's end May lead you to the throne. That conference Hath told me so; and pointed out the way. Perseus. Then let us spur upon it. Speak at once. Dymas. But,âPerseus on the throne,âwill he forget The hand that helped him there? Perseus. That hand shall be Feared as my own. What politic soul is thine That still distrusts what I a thousand times Have sworn unto thee!âIf, thro' aid of thine, I climb that eminence where I, by right, Should sit,âand not thro' favour or intrigue, I'll hold thee yet as giver of that throne; And thou shalt use the sceptre when thou wilt, As 'twere thine own.âBy heaven, and by deep hell! I swear it to thee! Dymas. Philip looks towards Rome. This new alliance hath blown up the flame That seemed burnt out. Yet he saith nothing on't. Lycius, with secret orders, is gone home. And Philip, on the morrow, will set forth To look from HÃ¦mus, on th' Italian plains. And thither must you also. Perseus. Ha! for what? That, in our absence, may the traitor leap Into the empty throne?âGoes he not too? Dymas. Noânoâhe stays behind to lose the throne. To my especial charge the king hath left him; To watch him,âread his purposes,âhis thoughts.â So far is your work, prince; the rest is mine. You've wrought suspicion;âI must forge the proof: And I will do'tâaye! and such blazing proof, That Philip, looking on it, shall be blind To all but vengeance. Perseus. Thou'rt the best of friends!â Dymas. Let this suffice thee now. It were not well That we were seen together;âand sharp eyes Are in the palace. Come to me at night, And we'll speak farther. Perseus. Urge him to the death!â Remember that. I have no hope to live, And reign, Demetrius living. He's a drug That every day I am compelled to drink. The phial must be broken,âcast away,â Ere I can breathe in health. Dymas. If that weak clay That's called Demetrius be not iron proof, He shall be broken,âand his poison spilt. So up to HÃ¦mus, prince, and draw free breath; For Macedon is thine. Perseus. And Perseus thine, To use in what thou wilt.âThe idiot's caught With this new toy,âthis princess. Dymas. Heed her not. Perseus. Oh no! The pretty butterfly may light On that flower suits her best. She is no bee To know where lies the honey. Let her go. An hour past sunset we shall meet again;â Till then adieu. Dymas. Adieu. I'll to my charge. [Exeunt. Scene IV. âThessalonica. A room in the house of Theoxana. (Enter Theoxana with her two Children.) Theox. Noânot to-night, my children! 'Twas this nightâ Two long, dark years backâthat your noble father Received the tyrant's summons;âand the morrow . . . But noâwhy should I cloud your sunny brows Because my own is dark?âGo to your dance. Eldest Child. Thank you, dear mother, we'll not dance to-night. Second Child. Pray you forgive us. Theox. Goâgoâtake your mirth. I'll watch you from this window. How the sun Pours gold upon the lawn,âand steeps the trees In floods of golden light!âYou pretty May-flies, Go, wanton in his beams!âand, as your feet Press the green sod, put in them all your soul; And for one hour, at least, you shall be happy. Eldest Child. Comeâcome away;â'twill please our mother so. (The Children go out. Theoxana stands looking at them through the window.) Theox. Beautiful children! How their nimble feet Spring on the velvet turf!âand their bright faces Sparkle like sunny waters! Kind heavens!â And I was gay as these;âhad foot as light;â A glance as quick;âa heart all merriment!â And nowâwhat am I?â (Enter a Servant.) Servant. A messenger from Prince Demetrius Craves instant audience. Theox. Bring him hither quick. [Exit Servant. I fear some ill at hand. His wicked brother Aims at his life;âor the old tyrantâWellâ (Enter a Messenger.) What is thy business? Messenger. Pray excuse my boldness. This to the noble lady Theoxana The Prince Demetrius sends;âand this Antigonus,â (Giving letters) Whose messenger even at your city gates I overtook. Theox. What dreadful business needs This double warning?âGenerous prince, thine first. (She reads.) âMy father's fury is at its height. Fly, dear lady:âthe lives of your children are threatened. The bearer of this is trusty, and may aid in your escape.âYoursâDemetrius.â My children's lives?âKnow you, sir, aught of this? Messenger. Nothing, fair lady. Theox. Good Antigonus Clear thou this mystery. (She reads.) Messenger (aside). Some dreadful thing That scroll does tell her.âHeaven have mercy then! Theox. Amen! for man hath none. Messenger (aside). She has o'erheard me Oh! she is sorely racked. Theox. Thou shalt not, tyrant! While there's a mother's hand to set them free. Their father thou hast sent into his grave; And nowâbut they shall 'scape thee, if there's steelâ Poison,âor choking water,âor steep rock, That can their souls, and beauteous bodies part. Ay! tho' this hand should deal the horrid blow. What's to be done?âSave them,âor with them die! Good friend, thy name? Messenger. Aratus, gentle dame. Theox. Ha! 'tis a name owes Philip little thanks. His wisest, truest friend, of that same name, The tyrant poisoned, and his son Aratus. Aratus. Oh! 'twas a cruel deed! Theox. Dost serve the king? Aratus. No farther than all subjects serve their king; My service is to Prince Demetrius. Theox. And he reports thee faithful. Aratus. The kind prince Should have none else but such. Theox. Wilt serve me truly? Aratus. Ay! madamâto the death! Theox. I do believe thee; Thy face is index to a faithful heart. Then hear, and mark me well. Th' insensate king, Mad in his hate, hath issued a decree To seize the children of all those, whose lives He late took on the scaffold. They will die. Thus am I now forewarnÃ«d, ere escape Be hopeless. Aratus. Gracious Heavens! Theox. Forbear, and hear me. To ÃnÃ©a on the morrow are we bound, To keep the festival. Go thou with us. The vessel lies in port, and all's prepared. There as in wonted sports we pass the day, Hire thou a bark, as for our home return; See that 'tis roomy, and provisioned well:â At deep midnight, when all are locked in sleep, For some far isle, beyond the tyrant's grasp, We will put forth. Oh! heaven will fill the sails To save the innocent.âAnd yet he died, That was all truth and honour!âMy good friend Wilt thou so serve me? Aratus. To my latest breath! Theox. Then haste away, and get thee to thy rest: At daybreak must thou rise. Take thisânayâtake itâ A king refuses not the beggar's mite, That goes to fill th' exchequer. Be not thou More haughty than a king. Aratus. Most gracious ladyâ Command me to the death. [Exit. Theox. Thou shalt not have them, tyrant. With these hands I'll throw them to the waves; or pierce their hearts Even with their father's dagger, ere to thee, Black monster! I surrender them.âOh Gods! And they are dancing on the sunny grass, As joyous as the summer flies about themâ Perhaps as soon to die!âJove! to thy hands I do commit them. [Exit. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âA mountain-top in the vicinity of Pella. Demetrius and Janira stand looking forth toward the east. Jan. How long will't be before the sun comes forth? Dem. Even now he's at Heaven's portal. Dost not see How all the eastern sky is touched with fire,â While overhead, and westward is deep blue? And there's one cloud,âthe only one in th' heaven, Floating upon the golden atmosphere Like a huge rock of ruby. Jan. Beautiful! Most beautiful!âOh! have I lived till now, And ne'er seen this? Dem. How men will haste and crowd To see a monarch in his tawdry state!â Yet the great king of light goes daily up To his resplendent throne; and scarce an eye Follows his rising. Jan. Demetriusâ Where is the glorious stretch of prospect round, You talked of? All below us is dense mistâ Nought visible but this huge mountain's top, And one or two below us, that scarce lift Their bald heads through the fog. Our morning's toil So far is lost;âyet I repent it not;â For, tho' the earth be hid, yet this fair Heaven Is beautiful, beyond the scope of thought, To one that hath not known it:âand the air,â How fresh and sweet!âand this most solemn stillness, As tho' all life had bowed th' adoring head In worship of heaven's King!âDemetriusâ Oh! is it not most beautiful? Dem. Go on With thy sweet musings. All that's beautiful In earth, or heaven, seems yet more beautiful In thy loved praises. What, to man, were earth With all its pomp of mountain and rich plain? What ocean, with its ever-varying might? What the bright ceiling of unbounded spaceâ The unapproachable glory of the sun, Or midnight, myriad-starred?âOh what, to man, Were all, if woman were not? Her sweet voice Gives fragrance to the sweetest breath of morn; To noon gives brightness,âcalmness to the eve,â And cheerfulness unto the gloom of night. Jan. This is the tale you tell a thousand ears,â And all believe it. Dem. Dost not thou? Jan. Be sure on't. But answer now. Why all this sudden haste? Why to this mountain-top,âthis very morn, No hour's delay permitted,âam I brought? And what's the business clouds your forehead thus? NayânayâI read it in your every look, And hear it in each word. Comeâno disguise: Your joys and sorrows must be mine,âmine yours; But cannot if we hide them. Speak your grief, And, in the very utterance, half its pain Shall pass away. Dem. Janiraâto this hill, In my young days a hundred times I came To see yon sun get up. This morn's my last. And I would take my leave on't ere I go. Jan. Your last?âWhat mean you? Dem. I must fly, my love. Too well I feel here is no home for me: A brother hates me,âand a father doubts: One would destroy me,âth' other will not save. Perseus, to take my life, sets daily snares; Philip beholds him,âand almost abets. I have no choice but an ignoble fate,â And by a brother's hand;âa life ignobler, Gained by that brother's death;âor else this flight. Jan. Where would you fly? Oh! is it come to this? Dem. To Rome, dear girl, where I have powerful friends, And true ones. Perseus then may hate, and plot; And my poor father rage and threat, in vain. We shall be safe; and hear the distant storm, Unheeding of the bolt. Jan. But, should your flight Be intercepted . . . Dem. Have no fear of that. The king will not return these four days yet. Dymas will aid me thro' PÃ¦onia; there Lies all our difficulty; and his power, As governor, can make it smooth and safe. Jan. Is Dymas honest? Dem. Honest? He's my friend: Bound to me by a hundred services:â He can't deceive me. Jan. But he's Philip's friend: And high in trust. Dem. Yet sees where Philip errs: And will not aid his crimes. From him I learn What urges me to this. He counsels me, For he knows well my danger, and the path By which to 'scape it. Jan. Be his counsel good! I like it not, and do not like the giver. But I have no experience of man's heart, And cannot judge,âor I should sayâbeware;â Dymas is hollow.âDo not ask me why;â I have no reason. When he speaks to me, I feel a danger;âwhen he looks on me, I shrink away,âyet have no cause to shew,â If't be not instinct. Dem. I do think him true; But now will mark him surer. Look, my love, The mist is clearing off; and spots of green Appear like islands in the vapoury flood. Anon 'twill all pass off; and then I'll shew thee A hundred places that are dear to me From sweet remembrance. Jan. Look! Demetriusâlook! The sun is peeping, like a burning eye, Above the far earth's rim. Oh! beautiful! Seeâup into the sky a thousand rays Shoot round . . . Dem. And all the mountain-tops are touched . . . Jan. And the green forest is all capp'd with gold. Now he goes up. Oh! the whole world should wake To see this majestyâDemetrius, Let us behold it often;âfor, methinks, This sight might keep us virtuous more than aught Philosopher or priest could talk to us. Who, that saw this, could on that day do ill? Look! look! But now I cannot look. Dem. Then hear. This very eve with Dymas I shall sup; And in the night set forth. Dost thou so love me, As,âsetting pomp and ceremony by,â Thou canst in private let our hands be joined; That so, without a spot on thy fair name, Thou mayst fly with me? Dost thou so far love? Jan. Oh! farther much,âor I loved not at all. But think again before it be too late. We must confer again, and yet again, Before this step be taken. Show me now The places that you spake of, for the mist Is melting off, and gives to view a world,â Or what might seem such. How magnificent! Dem. We'll mount our horses; for a hundred points Give, each, a different prospect; and all grand. Come, my beloved;âone happy morn we'll have, Tho' sorrow come at eve. Jan. Oh! do not fear. âThis is a very beautiful sceneâbut I doubt its effect in representation âis a marginal remark I remember seeing in one of my MS. copies of this play, on its being returned by Macready.âM. E. A. [Exeunt. Scene II. âA room in Philip's Palace. (Enter Dymas, with a Servant.) Dymas. When did the king arrive? Servant. Some half hour back, my lord; and the prince sent immediately to request speech with you. His majesty seems not in his wonted cheer, and forbade all show of rejoicing. But, so please you, my lord, I will announce to the prince your arrival, for he is impatient to have speech with you. [Exit. Dymas. Do so, good fellow. Not in wonted cheer? I've that shall rouse him. This dull melancholy Is mere stagnation: but in that do breed A thousand venomous and horrid things, Which in the cataract, or storm-shook water, Had never lived. Best life is found in action; And deathâbut total rest. The red-eyed soldier, Even in the battle's hurricane, when his sword With every motion gives, or wards off death, Is happier yet than he, who, by the fire, Moans o'er the toothache. Welcome, noble prince. (Enter Perseus.) Perseus. Dear friend, I thank thee. Wellâwhatâhast thou sped? Hast got him sure? Dymas. When he that lies entombed In Egypt's broadest pyramid,âthe mummy That, farther back than dim tradition goes, Hath slept beneath the everlasting load,â When he shall rise, and shake the burthen off, And walk into the air,âDemetrius then, And not till then, shall from his shoulders fling The fate that waits to sink him. Perseus. Best of friends! But how?âhow mean you? (Enter a Lord-in-waiting.) Lord. Let me not seem bold T'intrude upon you. Twice the king hath asked For the lord Dymas, and impatient waits. Perseus. He comes o' th' instant. Briefly tell me now. [Exit Lord. Dymas. I'll give the pith. Demetrius to Rome This night will fly,âstart not, nor say a wordâ All shall be after told thee. Philip's rage Will rise to madness when I pour the tale Full in his ear. The tender-hearted boy To cross his father's vengeance hath conspired And certain traitors aided in escape. They will be captured,âbut th' attempt not less His own doom seals. Last news I have to tell, And at this moment best,âour trusty friends Philocles and Apelles are returned. I've spoken with themâthey are well preparedâ The lesson that we taught is not forgot;â 'Twill change each drop of sweet that stays behind In Philip's bosom to the bitterest gall: And, when the scroll from Quintius comes at length, 'Twill turn him all to poison: every word Will bear Demetrius death,âand every look Shoot burning arrows thro' him.â Perseus. So it will! But go about it straight. Philip's displeased;â 'Shamed of his fruitless, and most foolish quest To look at Italy from Macedon;â And 'tis a humour that will keenly bite On whatsoever it can fix its teeth. Dymas. I'll change his darkness soon to fiery light. Be not far off;âyou may be wanted too. [Exit. Perseus. His fate is come at last. He cannot 'scape. By heavens! I hate him worse than ugly death; And will not long endure to breathe with him The air of heaven.âHe draws on him all eyes;â Ensnares all hearts;âsteals all men's expectations;â Plots for the throne, which is my proper right;â Lures to himself the bride, that should be mine;â Stands like a sun to which all eyes are turned: And leaves me but a shadow.âI must hate him, Or not be man;âand I do hate him so That I would rather feel the pangs of death Ten times each day I live, than see him live Crowned with his insolent hopes.âTo-nightâto-nightâ Somewhat must be to-nightâHa! fool! thou look'st For this blest night to cover thy foul deed, And in thy black rebellion set thee safe.â Fool! traitor! Roman minion! 'tis thy last! [Exit. Scene III. âAnother room in the Palace. (Enter Philip and Dymas.) Philip. I blame thee not. It was the task I set thee; An arduous one; and faithfully hast thou Fulfilled my bidding.âSend the traitor here:â I'll see him ere I sentence. Dymas. My dread liege! Have pity on him:âthink it more his fears, Than treasonous intents that moved him on; For truly he had wondrous fantasies, That haunted him, of snares about him laid,â False whisperings 'gainst him in your royal ear,â Foul accusations,âand, I know not what;â Things to perplex an older brain than his,â And drive it on to madness. . . . Philip. Or to treason! Talk on't no more. Thou art too milky blooded,â Who deals with rebels should have nerves of steel, And liquid fire within his veins,âand heart Unthawing as the snows of Caucasus.â Dymas. For Theoxana, and her traitor brood,â Vex not in vain, my royal liege, your soul. Eight days the eastern wind right in the bay Drove furiously, defying all escape. Our vessels in pursuit were seen from shore, Visibly gaining on her. (She heard.) Philip. Why that noise? The matter of those outcries? (Enter Perseus and Lords.) Perseus. Good, my liege, That which shall glad you. Theoxana's taken, With her two children. Passing on to prison,â I stayed the officers to hear your pleasure. Philip. Bring them before me. This is news indeed! [Exeunt Perseus and Lords. I'll hear the furious lioness roar out, To see her Roman cubs snatched from her sight. Go call Demetrius too:âI'll have them brought, The traitor and the traitress, face to face,â And then to prison both. Dymas. My royal liege The prince, two hours ere daybreak, was away Among the mountains. Philip. How?â Dymas. Intending flight, He had desire to pass one parting day In scenes that from his boyhood he had loved. With evening he'll return to sup with me. Such his intent, and so I did report it Unto your royal ear. Philip. His purposed flight You told of,ânot his absence. But, good Dymas, He must not hear of this. Ride forth at eve To meet him;âput what colour on't you will,â And let no busy tongue inform his ear Of what hath chanced.âHe hath hot friends among us May make his capture dangerous. More anonâ (Enter Theoxana and her two Children, conducted by Perseus, Lords, and two Officers.) Ha! traitress! art thou caught? Dymas (aside). Traitress! By heaven! Imperial Juno rather! Theox. Art thou Philip? Philip. Look round thee, woman,âand, if thou see'st here A head more kinglike, then am I not Philip. Theox. I see none here that might not wear as well That bauble on thy brow;âbut there's no face On which so legibly is written tyrant. Thou, then, art he. Perseus. Bold, shameless woman, peace! Or I will tear thy insolent tongue away. Theox. Ha! let me look upon thee.âThou'rt his son; The very copy of the foulest picture That ever libell'd man.âNayâdraw thy swordâ Upon a woman!âcaptive! Philip. Answer me, And leave thy railing. What dost thou deserve, The wife of a black traitor, and the . . . Theox. False! He was no traitor. Thou'rt the traitor, tyrant! Traitor to heaven, and rebel 'gainst mankind. Ay! stamp thy foot, and rage, I fear thee not. Philip. But thou shalt fear me. By the throne of Jove! I'll make thee crouch and whine like a whipp'd cur. Away with them to prison. Children. Mercy! mercy! Theox. Nay, ask it not, my children.âWe must die,â Let us die nobly, and not cowardly. Philip. Be not too sure thou shalt have leave to die. Theox. Then shall I live to curse thee, and bring down Heaven's wrath the fiercer on thee. Philip. Thou art bold;â But I have means to tame thee. Theox. Thou art bold;â For thou hast lived defying earth and heaven:â But there are racks more terrible than thine Awaiting thee in hell to make thee tame, Thou hoary murderer! Ay! murderer! Perseus. My gracious father,âmust I hold my hand From punishing this insolent? Philip. Keep peace. The higher she goes up,âthe worse her fall. Let her have room. 'Twill be rare sport anon To hear these big tones changed to puling cries For mercy!âmercy! Theox. For thyself beg that Of the incensÃ«d heavens. Of thee, be sure,â I will not ask it, tho' thy art strain out The torture to eternity. But, tyrantâ I do defy thee. O'er thy hoary head My murdered husband's scornful spirit stands And points in mockery at thee:âbut on me He smiles, and lifts his hand to heaven. Philip. No more. Away with them to prison:âand such freedom As with a strict security may live, That let them have, no more. Upon the morrow Bring them again before me. Theox. Come, my lambs; For one day longer will the butcher spare us. Let us to prison. Children. Mercy for our mother! Oh king, have mercy! Theox. Peace! I charge youâpeace! [Exeunt Theoxana and her Children with the Officers. Philip. She hath a noble heart. I pity her. Dymas (aside). She hath a form divine, and I will woo her. (Aloud) Apelles and Philocles, my dread liege, Last night returned from Rome,âwere it not well To hear what they may witness of the prince; Which, either shall confirm his guiltiness, Approving so your wrath,âor,âwhich heaven grant!â Shall from him wash away those foulest stains That now disfigure him. Philip. Goâcall them quick. Dymas. They wait without, my liege. I'll lead them here. [Exit. Philip. That fellow's honest:âloyal to his king,â Yet loving to his son, that is disloyal;â Painting his foul deeds o'er with colors fair, That yet conceal not all their filthiness, But show them, like a harlot's rotten cheek, More ugly for their fineness.âMust he die? My sonâmy youngestâonce my best beloved? Oh hard decree!âBut he is falseâdisloyalâ Friended with RomeâaccursÃ«dâdamnÃ«d Rome! Ha! if I prove him so,âa father's love, Tho' it were chain of strength enough to hold All earth suspended in heaven's glittering hall, Must crackâand let him sink. Oh ye good Gods! Give not to beds of kings fertility, For they but gender serpents: let the peasant Increase, and multiply,âand, for old age, Secure the love of children, and their children,â But make the loins of kings like barren rocks; Their issue is a plague.âHa! then I see it Writ on your faces. (Enter Dymas, and other Lords, with Apelles and Philocles, the Ambassadors.) You need use no words To tell me he's a traitor.âFor yourselves, I give you welcome, my good lords. The thing You have to say,âsay freely, and fear not. Philocles. Bad tidings do make hateful those who bring them. Philip. In eyes of fools alone. I am not one To fling away in rage the golden cup, For that the draught it brought was bitterness.â Without more prelude, to the matter, sirs. How stands Demetrius with our mortal foe? How with the Senators and Consuls, first? The army, and the worshipp'd mob of Rome, That all are kings? Philocles. Pardon, my gracious liege,â Hear, and believe me. Of all ages, ranks, Conditions, and opinions, is your son The theme for Roman praises. Apelles. 'Tis most true! Philocles. Go to the Senateâand you'll hear his name; Walk thro' the campâ'tis still âDemetriusâ;â Stand in the market-place,âmen talk of him; Glide thro' the fields, or by old Tiber's banks,â âDemetriusââstill âDemetriusâ is the wordâ Small harm in this, were nothing worse to come: But I must utter what to speak I dread, Did not the greater dread lest . . . Philip. Falter not! Out with it!âBy the omnipotence of Jove! If thou dost keep one syllable from my ear, Thy life shall rue it. Let it have full vent; They'd have him on my throneâI know they wouldâ Look not aghastâbut say âthis is not soââ Or sayââthis is soââ(a pause). Staring idiot! speakâ Or with this hand I'll strike thee to the earth. Philocles (kneeling). Dread majesty! forgive me that I sayâ This is even so (a pause). Philip. Go on. You hear him, lords. Lords. With sorrow, most dread liege. Philip. On sirâspeak out. How say the Roman gods our fate shall be? Let Philip hear, that he betimes may learn To tremble and obey.âNay, my good lordâ Stand not on foolish ceremony: speak Rude matter in plain words. The weakest eye May boldly look the sinking sun i' th' face; Take measure of his bulk,âand count the spots Upon his clouded disc;âtho' at his height, The strongest shrank to gaze upon his pompâ So kings, before whose state all eyes were dimm'd, All tongues were mute; or only heard in praise Such as men give the Gods,âshall, at their fall, Become the unfear'd gaze of basest eyes; The theme of rudest tongues.âSpeak, therefore, out, And tell the manner of our swift deposal,â As 'tis at Rome decreed;âand, with what state, And what permitted power, our loyal son Shall fill our forfeit throne. Philocles. My gracious liege! With justice do you in derision hold The vain designs of your proud enemy; Which more as matter for your laughter hear, Than for your wrath. Philip. Proceed. Philocles. The common talk At Rome is of new warlike preparation You have in hand, to subjugate the states, Late in rebellion 'gainst your royal right! And which, by treaties ratified at Rome, You had acknowledged free. Philip. What follows then? Philocles. Forgive me that their insolent boasts I speak. A force already have they set on foot;â The field already, in their thoughts, is won;â Then, to their victory to put the seal, And surety for the future. . . . Philip. Ha! so prompt? Philocles. Yourself, my gracious liege,â Philip. Proceed, proceedâ Philocles. Shall be deposed . . . Philip. As modest as 'tis sure. Philocles. Prince Perseus,âhated as his brother's loved,â To exile doomed, or safe imprisonment; So may Demetrius, on his quiet throne, Assure to Rome a vassal and a friend, Where now they see their most fell enemy. Philip. In sooth, right well devised!âa marvellous plan! Simple, and easy, and straight on to the end! Thus talk the people,âsay you: but the Senate,â What say they of us? Philocles. With more cautious voice They laud your son;âbut for yourself, my liege,â Forgive my speech,âwith vilest epithets . . . Perseus. Oh my dear father! hear no more of this: Or let such blasphemy to your private ear Be whispered,ânot i' th' face of men spoke out. Philocles. This letter, gracious king, from Titus Quintius. Philip. Ha! 'tis his hand. What matter have we now? (He reads in silence.) 1st Lord (to Dymas). His majesty looks not in wonted health. Dymas. This journey hath much dashed him. 1st Lord. He's more pale, And careworn. Dymas. Something's there that likes him not. See how he grinds his teeth. Philip (folding the letter hastily). Enough! enough! I ask no more than this. The parricide! Give me thy hand, my son. I doubted thee; And fear'd 'twas malice, or intriguing strife That moved thee 'gainst thy brother;ânow I see Thou hadst the sharper wisdom. But, fear not; On every step that leads up to a throne, There stand a myriad sharp, invisible swords, To hew down lawless climbers.âFor this traitor, He shall not put one foot upon the stair; Far less reach up to th' diadem. Thee, Perseus, In the eye of all men do I now proclaim My son, and sole successor. For Demetrius I here abjure him,âcast him utterly off;â And, as a cankered branch is hewn away, And thrown into the flames,âso from my heart Is he cut off,âand to such vengeance given As the just Gods to crimes like his decree! (A pause.) What say you, lordsâam I o'erharsh in this? Several Lords. Your majesty is ever merciful. Philip. Whyâmadman! did I send this egg to Rome To have it hatched a crocodile?âOh fathers! If in your sons you would affection hold, Still keep them in your eye;âfor filial love, Even like a fire untended, quickly dies If love paternal feed it not. He's lost! A traitor to his country, and his king! The bosom friend of Rome!âMust Philip dieâ Or see upon his throne a rebel son,â Himself deposed,âimprison'dâand his kingdom, That was erewhile earth's brightest, bowed to wear The manacles of Rome?âOr must he die? (A pause.) Had Saturn crushed the Thunderer at his birth, He had not lost his heaven!â Dymas (aside to the Ambassadors). How sorrow works Upon his royal mind! Apelles. He sees us not. Philocles. Yet he looks on us. Dymas. With the balls of sight, But not with that which should inform their sense. Most royal Philipâvex not thus your soul For one unduteous son, when still there lives Another, to whose heart you are more dear Than sunshine to the eye, or breath to life, Or food to him who famishes. Noble prince, Go to thy father, and assure his soul How thou dost love him. Perseus (kneeling). Father, on my knee I swear to theeâand may th' all-ruling Gods So help me as in simple truth I swear!â I have no wish but what to thee is true;â To thee who art my father, and my king: I seek no power or honour but from thee: From thee I had my life,âfrom thee must have All that can make life glorious. When to thee I prove disloyal,âlet th' omnipotent Gods Withdraw from me their favouring countenance! And give me o'er to fate! Philip. Riseâriseâenough! As thou to meâthy children unto thee!â Lords, for awhile farewell. We will retire, To drink in solitude the bitter draught Of filial ingratitude. Just heaven! [Exit. Lords. Our duties to your majesty. Perseus (aside to Dymas). He has it! [Exeunt. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. âA room in Philip's Palace. (Philip discovered.) Philip. There is no way but this. His guilt is plain To dullest eyesâboldâmonstrousâseen far off As huge Olympus.âWhen a limb's diseased Beyond the leech's art to make it sound, He cuts it off;âthus saving the whole man, Who else had perished with it.âMacedon Is now that man,âDemetrius that limb;â And I, alas!âhis fatherâam the leech That must the sharp and cruel knife direct To its stern purpose. (Enter a Servant.) What's thy business here? Servant. The lord Antigonus, so please your majesty, most urgently requests admission to your royal presence. Philip. What would he now? I have forbid his coming: But let him enter. [Exit Servant. (Enter Antigonus.) Well, old lord,âthy business? Antig. Philip, thy happiness,âthy son'sâthe State's. Forgive me, for I love Demetrius, And know him innocent. He is your son, And therefore should find mercy;âhe's a prince, And should have amplest justice. That at Rome He is beloved may be in him no crime: Is he not young, and beautiful, and brave,â Openâand generousâliberal in expenseâ Gifted with qualities that make men love And women worship? Are not these enoughâ Being a prince beside,âto draw the hearts Of Romans as of Macedonians? Is it a treason then to be beloved? If so the hated vicious are most loyal:â Is itâ Philip. Stayâstayâold man,âthou'rt ignorant here: He has found mercy,âand, be sure, shall find The amplest justice.âI will hear no more. Antig. Philip, farewell. Remember he's your son. [Exit. Philip. I would I could forget it (a pause). He must die; And presently;âor the mad people's love Will fortress him against the siege of justiceâ Demetrius, or Philip, must go out;â Rome must be stabbed, or Macedon.âWho waits? (Enter a Servant.) Bid the lord Dymas enter. (Exit Servant.) It must be! I cannotâmay notâdare not shrink. Come hither. (Enter Dymas.) Hast thou a heart to feel thy country's wrongs? Dymas. I have, my liege:âto bleed,âto die for her. Philip. Hast thou unto thy king such loyal love, That, well to aid him in a need extreme, Thou'dst on thy gentle nature violence put,â Drive pity and remorse from thy soft breast;â And be,âeven like the axe, that strikes the head off,â Feeling no sympathy?â Dymas. What Philip bids,â That will his servant act. I have no heart But what is Philip's;âhave nor hands, nor tongue, Nor any power of senseâbut what are his, To use as likes him best. Philip. Enoughâenoughâ He sups with you to-night.â Dymas. He does, my liege. Philip. His life is dangerous to the State and us. He must not liveâ Dymas. Then bring you him to trial? Philip. That were but shallow wisdom. Of the mob He is beloved,âthe soldiers too:âhis youth And comeliness would be loud orators In ears whereto his treasons could not speak. Yet must he die;âor, in his room, a host, Whom his rebellion, to a bloody death, Will bring untimely.âSomething must be done; Instantly,âsecretly,âyet, done, avowed; And his black guilt to all the world proclaimed The cause of this great justice.âWhat is done, Is borne with patience oft, as past recall;â Though, were it yet to do, a thousand swords, And fifty thousand tongues, would interpose To stay its executionâ(a pause). Dost thou think He might be spared, and yet the State . . . but no!â Advise me not to mercy,âfor his guilt Is broader than heaven's concave. Die he mustâ Or Philip fall,âand Rome. . . . It shall not be! (A pause.) To-morrow let me hear thee say . . . dost mark me? Dymas. Most earnestly!â Philip. To-morrow let me hear That . . . Macedon is safeâthat treason's flame Hath been put outâthat . . . dost thou understand? Dymas. I see a fearful spectre in your words; But 'tis in darkness yet. Philip. Dost dread to meet it? Dymas. I would 'twere more substantial. But, that thing Which Philip hath no fear to wish enacted, I may not fear to act. Philip. Thou sayst enough. He sups with thee to-night.âFill thou his cup. What! dost thou start?âThy words were bold enough. Dymas. So shall my deeds be. 'Twas a passing sting Of foolish pity;âbut the last. 'Tis gone! Philip. I'd have him laid asleep;âbutâtenderly. Seek thou some drug that shall extinguish life;â Not tear't to pieces.âI would have him dead; Yet would not wish him feel what 'tis to die. For oh! he's still my son,âmy youngest boy! Have ye no mercy, Gods?âMight he not live?â But noânoânoâI'll think upon't no more.â Fate calls himâhe must goâ [Exit. Dymas. So he but go, I care not at what door. But go he must; Or the bright honors that I seek to wear Will prove a drunken dream.âWhat matters it? Peasant, or princeâall must at some time die:â His turn is now;âmine when the Gods shall please. But not, I trust, before yon haughty dame Her lofty head as low as mine shall stoop;â Ayâcall me friend, and kind deliverer. I'll to her, and the tyrant paint so black,â Tell her of deaths contrived so terrible,â Shew her her children in their agonies Herself to brutal lust exposed, and death Horrid and infamous,âthen, for one poor boon, Promise escape.âShe mustâshe shall be mine. [Exit. Scene II. âA room in a Prison. (Theoxana and Aratus discovered.) Theox. So potent sayst thou? Aratus. Scarce the lightning flash Strikes with more sudden stroke. Upon the eye, Within the lip, or ear, one drop let fall, Doth, even like water on the lingering spark, All life extinguish. Theox. Without pain? Aratus. Sleep falls not Upon the infant's eyelids with a touch More tender than this gently dropping death. 'Tis but the breath breathed forth, nor drawn again. Theox. Oh thou most excellent balm of the bruised heart, For all the laughing nectar of the Gods I would not barter thy few joyless drops! I thank thee, true and gentle friend,âI thank thee. Commend me to the generous prince, thy lord, And say I blessed him ere I died. Make known The manner of our end, and for what cause, Lest cruel and unnatural he should deem The mother who her children could destroy. Tell him to 'scape the torture, and a death Of ignominy, she their innocent souls, In gentle sleep, without a pang, set free; Then hasted after. Sayâbut now no moreâ Time urges:âthe abhorrÃ«d monster comes With hellish suit again to file my ears.â Take thou this jewel:â'tis the sole one left By the rapacious spoiler,âyet so rich, That in contentment mayst thou pass thy days Unpressed by labour. Take it. Where I go, I may not carry it. This little phial Is worth to me a mine of gems. Aratus. Oh heavens! For such reward what have I done! Theox. The best, The kindest service;âoped for us the gate That leads from shame and pangs to liberty. But to thyself look now: no hand but thine Could bring this help. Fly quickly, or thou'rt lost. Adieu, and be thou happy.âHaste,âaway:â I would be on our journey. Aratus. Oh farewell! Most hapless ladyâand dear innocents, Farewellâfarewell. [Exit. Theox. How is it to be done? What is't that I would do?âBe firm, my soul; (She opens the door of an inner chamber.) And let no woman's weakness . . . How they sleep! Beautiful childrenâon their beds of straw! Their death-beds! Like pure rose-buds do they lie, All health and fragrance. 'Tis the spirit of lifeâ The in-breathed mystery from Divinity, All freshly glowing in them: and that fire, That light, I must extinguish! Can I do it? 'Tis but a touch:âbetter thanâOh! ye Gods! To see their little limbs upon the rack Writhing in agonyâand hear their cries To me, their mother, who might thus have saved,â But, with false kindness and a cruel love, Selfishly pitiful, dared notâOh! the curse Of every mother would pursue my name, And brand me weakestâmost unnatural! But what if to that villain's horrid suit I should appear to listen,âHateful thought! Foolish as hateful! Victims we must beâ Nor could heâwould he, save us. Die we must! Or thus,âor by the torture! Now to pause, A trembling coward, when, with but a touch, One merciful touch, from the black despot's bonds I might release them thusâIt shall not be! Ye awful Deities, within whose hands Are life and death to all things,âlook not down With eye of anger on this mortal deed, Fate's, and not mine,âbut, as your minister, In mercy sent, uphold me to the end! Fast locked in sleep! Now,ânow, my soul, be firm! (She goes into the inner chamber, and closes the door.) Scene III. (The foregoing scene draws up, and discovers the inner chamber, with the Children lying on their couches, and Theoxana sunk upon the floor beside them.) (Enter Philip with the Jailer.) Philip. Softâthey're sleepingâShade thy lantern, fellow, Or they may wake.âWhose order did he shew? Jailer. So please your majesty, he bore the ring Of the lord Dymas. Philip. Dymas? Jailer. Yes, my liege. Philip. I cannot think why Dymas sent him here. He urged me give the fellow his release, That he might use him to advantage me, SomewayâI know not how.âBut, was he not The servant of Demetrius, ere this woman's? Jailer. So I have heard, my liege. Philip. Didst hear them talk? Jailer. No word, my liege. Philip. He has been twice, you say. Jailer. Twice, my dread lord. Philip. And brought he nothing with him? Jailer. Nought that I saw, my liege. Philip. No letter?ânothing? Jailer. Nought, to my knowledge. Coming from lord Dymas, I'd no suspicion. Philip. Let him be detained: His looks were wild; I'll question him myself. For old Antigonusâsay I will not see him, Bid him awayâhis presence doth offend me. Put down the light, and leave me. [Exit Jailer. Dead asleep! I do not hear a breath.âAnd in a prison! And on the night, too, that she thinks her last! Might I but sleep like these.âI'd be the captive; And let her sit upon the golden throne,â And count myself the gainer. Shall I wake her? She will not answer me,âor say a word To bring my son in question. Yet she must;â For I would have his guilt more bright than day, To clear my terrible justice.âHoâawake!â Theox. (starting up). What art thou?âHa! the tyrant!âhave I slept? My children.âMerciful Gods!âthey're safeâthey're safe! Philip. And thou too shalt be safe, so thou confess Thy treasons, and my son's. Theox. I will be safe. One precious drop remains. (Raising the phial to her lips.) His treasons?âfiend! He is a God to thee, and all thy race. Philip. But he's a traitor. Dymas hath revealed His black designs: he knew them all. Theox. False! false! Thy son is true;âand Dymas false as hell! Philip. What ails thee, woman? Theox. Dying, tyrant.âLook, My babes are gone before. Philip. Ho! helpâhelpâho! What horror's this? Theox. Thy work! Oh Gods!âone wordâ Demetrius is most trueâDemetriusâ Dymasâis falseâis falseâthy sonâOh Gods! (She dies.) Philip. Helpâhelp.âShe's dead.âHa! poison? (Taking up the phial.) Jailer (rushing in). Good my liege! Philip. She's poisoned.âAll of them are poisoned!âFellow, What dost thou know of this?âSpeak, on thy life! If thou dost palter with me . . . (Drawing his sword.) Jailer (sinking on his knees). Gracious king! Have mercy on me! I am innocent! Philip. Ha! now I see itâ'Tis that menial's workâ Aratusâhenceâdrag him before me!âfly! [Exit Jailer. We're mocked.âHath Dymas known of this? What?âhow? She called him falseâHe dared notâTo what end?â If he be falseâDemetrius may be . . . Ha! A letter?â'Tis the hand of Dymasâ (He reads.) âMost beautiful, and unhappyâThe king is enraged to the utmost. If no shield come between you and his wrath, yourself and your children will on the morrow die miserably in torture.ââWhy thou shameless liar! âI will visit thee again to-night. Consent to my wishes, and I can, and will save you. Refuse meâand bid farewell to hope,âthe tortures are prepared.âI shudder to think of them.ââ 'Tis sure the hand of Dymas. (Enter Jailer with Aratus.) (To the Jailer). Hasten backâ Call in Antigonus: something he may know.â [Exit Jailer. Have I been played on?âFellow! wouldst thou live,â Answer me truly:âpalter with me nowâ And I will scatter thee abroad like dust.â Who sent thee here? Aratus. Lord Dymas. Philip. What the errand? Aratus. I bore from him that letter. Philip. And the poison? Aratus. At her most earnest prayer I brought her that. Lord Dymas knew not of it. Antigonus (hastening in). Philip! Philip! Thou'st almost broke my heart. Thou art betrayed! Apelles, as he left the court to-day, Was struck with death.âHis conscience tortured him;â He sent for me, and, with his dying breath, Made full confession of such treachery As chokes belief.âThat letter was a lieâ Quintius ne'er saw itâ'twas the damned issue Of Perseus and black Dymasâ Philip. Sayst thou?â Antig. Yesâ They forged it,âbribed the ambassadors to bring it,â To poison you with lies against your son . . . Philip. AwayâawayâDemetrius may be lost!â Oh! if the horrid cup be at his lipsâ Dash it away, I do beseech you Gods! My guard ho! and my chariot! [Exeunt omnes. End of the Fourth Act.</field>

Your brother, and the princess, good my lord; None else. Perseus. Go thou behind thy master's couch, And whisper in his ear that I am come, And would speak with him instantly. Beware That none o'er-hear thee. [Exit Servant. It must be to-night. For every instant that he lives doth seem To sting me for my folly.âHe removedâ This arm is not more servant to my wish Than will the soldiers be.

Nay but, sweet girl,âthe cold moist air of night, On bodies unrefreshed by wholesome rest, Oft strikes diseases like a pestilence; But, to the limbs that gentle sleep hath fed, 'Tis as a cooling, and a strengthening bath, Pleasant and healthful.âPrithee my sweetâWIFE. Jan. Nay then, sweet lord, by that name first conjured, I cannot say thee nay. Good-nightâgood-night. Dem. Good-night, Janira; and kind dreams be thine. An hour past midnight will our horses wait.

What! hast thou crushed him?â Dymas. Great Gods! forgive me! Give me thy handâOh Gods!âOh! Gods! (He dies.) Perseus. He's gone! All his ambition,âall his glittering hopesâ Sunkâlostâin ever-during darkness quenchedâ Even like the rapid, and eye-dazzling lightning, That, for a space, doth seem to fire the heavens, Making earth tremble, and the stars go outâ Then from his sky-path shoots into a bog, And sleeps with rottenness!âWell, Dymas, well;â I little thought thou'dst teach me moralize. Thou'rt dead,âbut I will make thee still my friend: I'll show thee to the soldiers, thus carved up By gentle Philip;âand it shall go hard But thy eclipse shall make my beams more bright. But no delay: the purchase of one hour May be a diadem;âeach minute then Rates as a precious gem, and cries, dispatch, PerseusâKing Perseus! Romeâand Victory! [Exit. Scene III. âA room in the Palace of Philip. (Enter Lysimachus and Onomastes, with Calligenes, a physician.) Lysim. No hopeâsay you? Calli. Noneânone! His hours are few. Onomas. Unhappy king!âHow doth he bear himself? Calli. Even like a lion in the pangs of death. His tortured soul it is that burns the body, Which else hath no disease. Lysim. He ever had A spirit most untamed. Doth his mind wander? Calli. Most fearfully!â'Tis as a midnight tempest; Dark and outrageous, with deep calms betweenâ I must unto him. Onomas. We will go with you. Alas! poor Philip! is thy burning sun Thus sinking into night?â Calli. Good friends, I pray you, What things so-ever you may see, or hear,â As strange and dangerous is his discourse,â Upon your lips put seals. Lysim. Our memories Shall be as graves, wherein, like things deceased, His words shall be interred. [Exeunt. Scene IV. âThe chamber of Philip. (Philip lies on a couch. Antigonus, and attendants are in waiting.) Servant. I think, my lord, he sleeps. Antig. His eyes are open; Do not disturb him. Take those lights away, And keep the chamber dark.âHe is worn out, And may sink down to sleep. Servant. Heaven grant he may! That was an awful struggle. (Enter Lysimachus, Onomastes, and Calligenes.) Antig. My good friends! Would I had seen you at a gladder hour! But welcome now. Sorrow craves sympathy, As well as merriment. Onomas. How is the king? Antig. Even like some goodly temple, which the flames Have almost vanquished,âsilence now, and smoke,â Anon fierce light, and roarings terrible. One fearful agony hath just gone by, And left him strengthless. Calli. He is sinking fast. I do not think he hath an hour to live. Philip. Then bring him to me:âbring him to my faceâ I'll see him ere he diesâ Lysim. What is't he mutters? Antig. Hushâhush!âStill raving of his hapless son! Philip. 'Tis pity he should die!âso beautiful! So young and kind! Oh Gods! 'tis pitiful! Art sure on't, Dymas?âTell meâart thou sure? Ah! so?âThen he must die! Oh Gods! Oh Gods! Onomas. What dreadful groans are these! Lysim. What words! Antig. Hushâhush!â Philip. But do it gently;âfor he is my sonâ Although he be a traitor! Onomas. Horrible! Lysim. Most horrible! Calli. Nay, my kind friends,âbeware,â One word may turn this calm into a tempest, 'Twould madden you to hear. Philip (half rising and gazing in terror upon vacancy). Why, who art thou? Take off thy bloody, glaring eyes,âfoul thing! It was thyself that did it.âGet thee gone, With thy two livid brats!âHa!âtouch me not! Thou'rt black and swoln!âTake off thy poisoned handâ Off! off!âthou smellest of the grave!âGo backâ And let the worms begin their meal on thee!â Ay! beckon as thou may, I will not goâ Why dost thou smile?âWhat!âis thy husband there? Ha! now I see him. Wert thou not a traitor? No?âOhânoânoâI warrant thee no traitorâ Smile an thou wilt.âFarewell.âEven so?âOh Gods! (He falls back.) Lysim. He's gone! he's dead! Calli. Not soâmy good old friend. Pray you be calm. Onomas. Look where the princess comes. Will you admit her now? Calli. It soothes the king To look upon her, for it makes him weep; And in those showers the fires come harmless down, That else might turn to lightnings. 'Tis his will That she have all times entrance. (Janira entersâpale and haggard.) Antig. Hapless lady! How fares it with you? Janira. Have you seen him, sirs? Antig. Pray you sit down. Come, child, thou'rt cold and faintâ Hereâsit you down. Janira. I thank you, reverend sir,â But I'll not sit. He will be here anon. I have a song for him,âa sweet new song;â I know 'twill please him.âShall I sing it to you? Antig. Thou hast not strength, dear lady.â Janira. Hushâhushâhush! I made it as I sat beside his grave, Last night, in the soft moonlight; and I sang it Till morning beamed;âbut he was fast asleep, And did not hear me! 'Tis a sad,âsad ditty. Pray you sit down, and I will tell it you;â Not sing it till he comes . . . âUpâup, sweet prince; for the morning is bright, And the clouds are purple and gold: Up,âup,âthou dear sluggard, and come to the light, From thy bed so darksome and cold. What dost thou there, With thy amber hair,â Thy rosy cheek,â Thy skin so sleek, Thy limbs like the roebuck light?â Come,âskim o'er the valleys, and bound up the hills; And plunge in deep forests, and drink at the rills; And eat of the berries so bright:â What dost thou there, in the murky grave, Wrapp'd up in that ugly shroud;â Thou that are beautiful, young, and brave,â When the winds are singing loud, And the trees are nodding their beautiful heads . . .â But indeed I can talk no moreâso I will e'en sit me down on the grass here, and go to sleep. Ah! well a day! the sweet spring flowers are all gone. I thank you, kind sir. (She sits on the floor.) Onomas. Poor lady! what an overthrow is here! Antig. Each day she wastes, and wastes, and pines away. Yet still she talks, and sings;âand sometimes smiles, As if she felt no pain. Lysim. (to Calligenes). How is the king? Calli. In a deep stupor that bodes little good. I dread his waking. Jan. Did you, my sweet lord?âI' faith I heard you notâ I cannot sing again;âso, pray you, get up and come to me. Oh! oh! Antig. She grows paler and paler. Jan. What! go to you?âNay, you would hold me fast.â Pray you get upâI'm very faint and cold.âWell love,âI will but take one little sleep, and then I'll sing to you again.âDark âdarkâOh me! (She lies down, and dies.) Antig. She's fainted.âHelp her, good Calligenes. Lysim. How deadly pale she is! Calli. She'll never redden. She's dead. All. Dead?â Philip (raising himself). Dead! Who's dead? who dares to die? Where am I?âBring me lightsâ'Tis not too lateâ My chariot ho!âlightsâlights! Ha! do not drink! 'Tis poison! dash it down!âDemetriusâ Drink not, I sayâha! fool!âhe will not hearâ He drinksâhe drinksâhe drinksâLook in his faceâ It has him! ha! it has him! see! see! see! He dies!âhe dies!âOh, Gods! he dies! he dies! (Philip sinks back.) Onomas. Most dreadful sight!âHast thou, Calligenes, No drug that might a kind oblivion bring Upon his tortured spirit? Calli. Petty sorrows, Physic may soothe,âbut, to such giant ills, There's no oblivion, but the great oneâdeath. (Trumpets are heard without, and loud shouts.) Philip (starting up). Hark! hark!âthe Roman trumpets! Bring my arms! Call up the soldiersâ Antig. (to the Attendants). Hasteâand hush that din. (Two Attendants go out.) (Trumpets again.) Philip. Are we betrayed?âWhere are the sentinels?â Lights! lights! we cannot strike them in the dark!â Ha! Quintius!âlet me meet thee once again!â My horse!âmy horse!âLook! look!âThey scale the walls! Dash them down headlong! Grapple with them close! Leap off! leap off!âNow let the Phalanx move! They fly!âthey fly! Come onâI'll lead you onâ Victory! victory!âdeath, or victory! (He staggers from the couch, waving his arm; and soon falls down senseless.) Calli. Deathâthen!âunhappy Philip! All. Is he gone? Calli. No.âThere is yet a flutter at his heart: 'Tis but the last weak tremble, while the soul Bids farewell to its clayey tenement. Antig. He opes his eyes:âhis frenzy is past oft. Let's lift him to the couch. Calli. Nayâmove him not. There's now so small a spark,âthe lightest breath May put it out. (Re-enter the two Attendants.) Antig. What is it you would sayâ Yet fear to utter?â 1st Attendant. Is the king no more? Antig. He is as one that's dead,âtho' yet he breathes: All sense hath left him. Attendant. Happy then I am That what I speak his ear can never know. Antig. What is't you mean? Attendant. Prince Perseus is named king. All. How?â Antig. Ere his father have paid Nature's debt? Attendant. The army, with loud clamours, made him king; Crowned, and proclaimed him:âin return for which He thanked and flattered them;âand, on the spot, Flung out defiance against Rome; and War, Even to the uttermost.â Calli. The king would speak. Philip. Kind friends! I have but little breath for speechâ Forgive me if I've wronged youâI've been madâ There's somewhat I would sayâI know not whatâ Let me be buried by Demetriusâ And lay his hapless wife within his armsâ She's deadâso some-one whisperedâyesâshe's dead!â I have been madâand fierce.âForgive me, heaven! Where are you?âIt grows darkâI have no breathâ (A pause.) Ha! Perseus! ha!âI see thee,âfratricide!â I see thee, kingâand captive.âLook!âhe walks, Barefooted, and with dust upon his head, Before the conqueror's chariotâsee!âhis wifeâ His childrenâSpare them, Gods!âthey walk, and weep, Shame-stricken, with their faces bowed to earth.â I hear the Roman Triumphâhark! they shout! They point the finger at him!âsee!âsee!âsee! Oh Gods!â(He sinks and dies.) Calli. He's gone! Antig. And, dying, hath he prophesied. (Trumpets, and shoutings again without.) Ay! Perseusânow rejoice! The fruit is ripeâ Watered by father'sâand by brother's blood!â Eat of it while thou maystâand gorge thy fill: But there's a bitterness far worse than death To follow on thy surfeit.âThou art king,â But there's a king above theeâKing of kings! Who sees, and will reward thee.âTo His hands We trust for justice! The Curtain Fails.</field>
