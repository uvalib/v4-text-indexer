      <field name="fulltext">The Preface. If case by Poets skill, or Pallas prudent ayd Historians oft in Hystories, their hole delightes haue staid To pen &amp; paynt forth painfully, the modest liues of those, That do in Uertues Scoole their hoap, and confidence repose: Then wandringe in the Forrestes wyde, wher fragrant flowers grow I meane in searching Histories, wherin doth wisdom flow. Our Auctor found out one, wherin he tooke delight, And moued therto by his frend, gaue franke consent to wright: So simplye as hee coulde, though wantyng hawtie skill, In that from Helicons fayre spring, the Muses him exile: Ne would Kay Citheria seeme, Dame Clio to permit, To garnish him with Rethoricque, the Gods did frowne at it: So peuish Pan possessed him, whose rusticke Pipes did carpe, Whose concordes were far dissonant, to sweete Appollois Harpe: Yet beare with him, and vs also, wee homblye you desyre, Let Grissills Pacience swaye in you, wee do you all require, Whose Historye wee vnto you, in humble wise present, Beseechyng God, wee alwayes maye in trouble bee content: And learne with hir in weale and woe, the Lord our God to praise, My time is past, my charge is done, I needs must go my wayes. Finys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Politicke perswasion. Benedicite, Sante, good Lorde where am I now, Marie I may say to you I had a sodden fall, Euen now I sawe Venus milkinge a Cowe, Who toke me by ye hand &amp; led me to her palace royall Whear Cupid hir sonne sat with his bowe in hande, Lyke a manlye Archer his fooes to with stande, She spread the table and made me good cheare, We had Cakes and Creame plentifull store, But thence I was taken and carried by the heare, And placste at the entrie of Iupiters dore, Who peepinge out at the keyhole espied my face, And with capp and knee welcommed my good grace, Lorde what sollace was made at my enteraunce, Orpheus the God of harmonie, was sent for to supper, And Mercurius for apresent, a frend of mine olde acquaintaunce, Brought to welcome me, adishe of Almond Butter, Saint Peter fryed Pancakes a iolly good pace And sent them as daynties to Iupiters grace Ther was no remedie but I must lodge ther all night, And in the morninge after breakefast was done, I was set on a Horse which to my Iudgement and sight, Was snowted like awodcoke, and bellied like a Tonne, But Lorde so he praunsed from the topp of Iunos Towre, Hee carried me thre hundreth mile in the space of an hour, But by chaunce comminge to the pauillion of mightie Mars, Bellona the goddis of battaile in Armor was clad, With twentie thousand men waightinge at hir ars, Which sight so amazed me that as one bestraught or mad I spurred cut with my furie outragious and fell, That he cast me hedlonge to the Dungion of Hell, As a new come gest I was plased at Belzabubs Table, But such a sight of Crabtree facst knaues were seruitors ther, I swear by myne honor, I vse not to fable, They put my manly hart in a wounderfull feare. But then calling to Iupiter for his fauour and grace, I was sodenly tranceported, by his Aungell from that place: And set on my Horse backe euen as I was before, And postinge to and froe, my prauncer fell on his knees: Euen right against the entrye, of his glorious goodly dore, Who sat by the fyres syde, eating of Bread and Cheese: God spede quoth I and quickly open the gate, But he gaped gredelye and bad me cease my prate, Thou wilt wake God al mightie &amp; his Aungels out of their slomber Nay quoth I thou art loath thy dynner to lose, But at that worde I sweare by sayncte Duncomber He cast me downe churlishye, and had lyke to broke my nose, Throughe the thicke cloudes I had a merueilous fall, That I had lyke to broke my necke on the tope of westminster hall But charinge crosse was my frende and caught my lege in his hand The wethercocke of Paules to ayd me to his flight, And betwen these two franions ye shall vnderstand, I was set on my legges and reyred vpright, The crosse in cheape for ioye I had scapt this ill fauoured chaunce, Did playe on abagpype, and the standerd did daunce. Heare let ther be aclamor, with whouping and halowinge, As thoughe ye weare huntinge, or chasinge the game. Enter Gautir, Sansper Fidence, Reasone, and Sobriete. Gautier. Euen now from hawtie woods, wher Eccose syluer sownde, Amonge the shroubs and valies loe, to skyes doth forth rebound Euen synce Aurora gan to shoe, on earth feaire Phebus race, Dianais knights by earnist toyle, haue followed the chace, The w?dring Bucke by staggr?g strocke, of launch from blody boe And nimble course of silly houndes, hath caught the ouer throe, To noble states the Uenall game, of huntinge doth pertaine, To recreate ther tristie mindes, and make them ioye againe, So we which longe in secret close, haue kept the walled towne, Did iudge it mete the chace to sue, ther by to wyn renowne, A worthie wight I Gautier am, and Marquis by discent, Of parents noble sanguine race, whose fames most excelent, In auriat troump, wt chearfull voice, through Europ blowne hath bin Whose iust deserts in marciall feats, the laurell wreath did win. As they did saflie rule, Salutias worthye towne, So I their seede do Fame atchiue, who thundreth my renowne: Speake on my knightly knightes, eche one shewe forth your mind If that in vs through ruling state, once faultie ye vs fynde. Fidence. As you moste worthye wight conserue, our countrie men from paine, And seeke Salutiais lawes by toyle, &amp; studie to maintaine, So wee your leige men still consent, your honor to obaye, Insufficient are wee noble Lorde, thy vertues to displaye: Politicke Hunters quoth you? mary heres agoodlie rable, They haue slaine Buckes as manie as Ile holde in my hand, To eate Uenisson the knaues be able, But the flesh that they kill, feedes in the Sea sand: God speed master Hunter, haue you killed anye Chuckes, I beleue your Houndes haue spoyld my Beldames Duckes. Gautier What art thou that thus vnreuerently dost prate, Ether for what cause dost thou thy selfe thus mysuse, Dost thou not blushe my honorable estate, Thus shamlesly with skorninges to abuse. Politick. Fyrst to reaunswer your former assercion, what am I nay staye ther, I know not my selfe, But you may see by my naturall condicyon, I am neyther Cossit, Calfe, Oxe, nor Elfe, Nether the quallites of any brut beast can I put in vre, Hauinge such a thinge a midst my face I am sure. Gautier. Thou semest some merye companion to be, What is thy name declare vnto me. Politicke My name, body o God, I am cleane nipt in the head, My name, whye wher is it, what is it fled, A name quoth you? marie I am nowe dressed in my kynde, I had rather then fortie pence my name I could fynde: Reason Hearest thou felowe, what shall wee call thee, Politicke Euen as you please, so let it bee: Sobrietie Euen as I please, I perceiue thou doest doat, Politicke In faith sir my name is gone to hunt Hadockes, in cocke Lorells Boat, But I will not cease huntinge, as a Hound doth for his praye, Till I haue found it agayne by this good daye, So, so, so, lo, now seeke all about, Nowe searche euerie hole, wythin and without, Well sought and now found at the last, I haue followed my chace wounderfull fast, Would you know my name syr shoe me with speed, I am cauled Polliticke perswasion in deed. Gautier. Polliticke perswasyon a name right excelent, And for our person very conuenient, Wherfore if thou wylt with vs haue resydence, Thou shalt be intertayned, vsinge thy dilligence, Politick. I thanke you, and I will so do, that my behauor, Shall merrit I trust your loue and fauor. Gautier. Well now my seruants sith ye eleuate my prayse, For imperie and rule what other occasyon, Resteth, that shold not augment our fame alwayse Expresly to shoe it straight make inuasyon. Reason None that we know, but one thinge we desyre, Trustinge in God that our reasonable petiscyon, Which of your honor we craue with harts intyre, Shalbe fulfylled hearing therof deffyniscyon. Gautier Say what you please we doo you frely lycence, I can not graunt before I heare your sentence. Fidence. L?g time haue we your seru?ts hard, ye c?m?s mutr?g voice Long time haue we c?ceald the cause, why they can not reioice Long time haue we in secret close, gusht forth our bitter teares Long haue we sp?t in dolful plaints, these fragr?t fertil yeares The cause vnknown to you we Iudge, of this our mestful chear Which to redresse prepare wt speed, to heare thy listning eare. Politicke For twentie pounde here is some broyle toward, Per. Now Polliticke perswasion shoe forth thy skyll, I will make him obstinate stoberne and frowarde, If that I may atchiue my purpose and will. Gautier. Why frends what thing should moue you thus, in secret to c?plaine Why shold you kepe from me ye thing, yt doth augm?t your paine, Of nature am I such a one, that rigors force doo vse, To giue regarde to your complaints, did I as yet refuse, Then why from me shold ye thus hide, the thing that causeth greef Speake on faint not, ostend your woe, doubt not to finde releef. Politicke Honistlie spoken I swere by Saint tan, Per. My master you see is a francke harted Gentillman. Reasone We can not cease but iustlie yeld, to thee condingly praise, Which gratfully reaunswerst vs, the Lord prolonge thie daies, And graunt thee doble Nestors yeares, trancquillite and peace, That thou maist rule and safly raigne, with honors iust increase. Politicke This is a goodly kind of salutacion, &amp; a wonderfull kind of regratulacyon Per. I am plaine Dunstable I may say to you, I am as homlie as the good wife that for loue kist her Cow. Sobrietie This is the meane why we remaine, in pensiue pained plight, This is the cause that anguishe doth, our sollace banishe quit, That you in single state abyde, and marriage do refraine Wold god you wold inioye that yoake, th? swaged were our paine Th? should our mestfull harts that long, haue subiect bine to woe Cast of the clogge of heauines, and dryry teares forgoe, Then shold our tristfull mindes exile, their dolfull deadly care, And ioy, infr?g those grisly gulphes, which doth our footsteps snare Politicke Bones is all this intretaunce for wiuinge, Per. Some men are married, and would be vnweddid againe, And some men neuer fall to thriuinge, Before they be spoused, this is euident and plaine, But who so euer intendeth of that misterie to be tastar. Findeth oft times the graie mare better maister. Gautier My frendes full frendly I replie, with protestacyon due, That single life preferred is, in sacared scripture true, But happie are the married sort, which liue in perfit loue, Twice happier are the single ones, S. Paull doth plainly proue, For such as leade a virgins life, and sinfull lust expell, In heauen aboue the ethrall skies, with Christ ther lord shal dwell. Fidence. We graunt that scripture doth extoull, vestais sauorie flower And happie are the continent, which rest within hir bower, But yet for you more mete it were, conioyned for to be, That after you your sead of rule, might haue the dignite, For wher ther is no ishue left the wise man saieth plaine, That euery man in Lordlie state, doth couit for to raigne. Politicke Baw waws is no weddinge the prouerbe doth tell, Per. Marie quoth you? I hard many a one saye, That the first daie for weddinge all other doth excell, For after they haue had not one merie daie. Quod the good wif I wold be vncopled, &amp; with sobs the same wisht For I shal neuer haue helth in my hed, while he hath pith in his fist, Sayth the good man, I haue such a shrewe to my wyfe, I speake vnfaynedlye, I swere by Gods mother, I am halfe werye of this present life, To be rid I would giue the Deuill one halfe to fetch the other: I speake not generally, all ronne not this race, But some are redie to catch their husbandes by the face. Reason What ioy should such as subiectes be, to see this daye possesse, Gautier. Content your myndes if case I graunt, your state for to redresse: Ye shall permit your worthie Lord, in choyce to vse his skill, And eke permit as reason is, to marye whom I will. Sobrietie Chuse wher you please, take wh? ye list, we wil you not gainsay. Gautier. Then will I soone elect my mate, and time shall haste the daye. Politicke Loe nowe my Lorde wilbe married, we shall haue a feast, But wher is his wife, can anie man tell, He will haue such a one I iudge at the least, Whose bewtifull countenaunce, shall Hellen excell, A fayre gerle, tricke, and minikin trim: A neat trull, which in yeres shall be like vnto him, Nowe God of his grace, in your choyce sende you good lucke, And graunt that your loue maye laste for euer, I beseech God send you with her, as manye hornes as a Bucke, That your tounge, hir nose, &amp; my tayle: may be ioyned togither. Gautier. What is that? Politicke God graunt that in loue ye maye continewe togither. Gautier. Well nowe let vs depart this place. Both. Wee will wait vppon you by Gods grace. Exiunt. Politicke Naye I will followe after as fast as I can, For if I be missing my Lorde lackes a man. Heare enter Grissell, Syngyng. and Spinning: wyth her Parents, and Indigent Pouertie. The Songe. God by his prouidence deuine, Hath formed mee of slimie Claye, Then whye shoulde I in ought repine, Or seeke his will to disobaye: Be it far from me to do such ill, As to contende against his will: Singe danderlie Distaffe, &amp; danderlie Ye Uirgins all come learne of mee. Let Children to their parents giue, Obedience due, as they are taught, Then they on earth full long shall liue, &amp; ioy ye place which Christ hath bought With his hert blood, &amp; deadly wound, Whear lasting ioyes shall aye abound, Singe danderlie Distaffe, &amp; danderlie, Let children all come learne of mee. Though Aetas on my parentes heare, By crooked shape haue showen his power, Yet I am bound to dread &amp; feare, Them tide and time &amp; euerie hour: For God to me hath giuen such charge, As in his lawe is seene at large, Sing danderlie Distaffe, &amp; danderlie, Each child with speed come learne of me. Set Natures lawes before your eyes, which may your tender mindes c?strain, All crooked language to dispise, And mend your misse, for feare of paine, The stoberne childe, the Lord doth threat In hell to chast, with torments great, Danderlie Distaffe, and danderlie, Ye Uirgins all come learne of me. Conserue and keepe virginite, Your conscience do not pollute, But walke in true integrite, all sinfull lust do cleane confute, Fly such men as, wold you allure To spot with lust your liues so pure, Danderlie Distaffe, and danderlie, Ye Uirgens all come learne of me. Obaie such men as you do serue Use dilligence at all assaise, Then fame hir Troumpet will preserue To thunder forth to skies your praise From filthie speach your tounges refraine, Let godlines in you remaine, Danderlie distaffe, and danderlie, Ye Uirgens all come learne of me. Grissill. How do you my Parentes? I praye you declare: Mother. Well good daughter God be praysed. Ianikell Trulye I thanke God that merie ye are. Indigent. Oh how ioyfull would I bee, if God in my aige had raysed, Mee such a chylde, to comfort my needfull indigence, She neuer ceaseth toyling, but laboreth alwaye, Shewyng to you the fruites of true obedience: Of her birth good neighbours bee ioyfull ye maye, For to your horie heads, shee is a perfit staye. Grissill. In youthfull dayes when sappie youth, his blossoms did displaye, Wh? euery lim, for w?t of str?gth through green yeres had no stay My Parents here stil carefull were, their child with food to norish, As dutie was so Nature wrought, they did me euer cherishe, From tender dayes to this estate, by payne they haue me brought, And now that aige hath clogde them both, to comfort them I ought But yet my paine vnable is, their paines to recompence: Whose studies still imployed were, to saue from inconuenience, Their only childe they fostred ought, with sustinaunce full due, And should I now vngratfullye, with vile disdayne pursue No God for bid, that through myfalt, I should ther griefes increase To labore still to comfort them, these hands shall neuer cease Ianicle. Ah my deare Child whose flour?g youth, in vertue stil doth florish Our horye heades if thou wert not, for foode were like to perishe, Our backes were lyke for want of cloth, extrem cold to abyde, But thou for vs continually, by labore dost prouide, Thy dilligence my neighbours all, can iustly forthere port, Thou art thy parents only staye, and staffe of their comfort. Mater. Grissill I pray the to my talke giue good head, Thou sest thy father is lame and I very oulde, Cease not as thou hast begonne to comfort his nead, For the panges of death on me haue taken hould, I fele me selfe verie sycke, increased is my paine, Nought now but the ground can make me faine. Grissill. Good mother comfort your selfe be of good cheare, You shall want nothinge your paines to aswaige, Let not sicknes cause you anie thinge to feare, For that may be a meane to inlarge your domaige. Mater. Deare Childe of thy wonted care and dillygence, Thy father and I haue perfit intelligence, Whose aidge se thou hould in worthy estimacyon, Loue and obay him giue him, due venerasion, Then God will blesse the with his sprit and grace, Yea on earth thou shalt longe ronne thy race, Be not hye mynded, let not Pride infeckt the, Lest God in his wrath with his scurge correckt the, Be no pickthanke, seke not the fruts of discensyon, Be rather a peace maker to bannish contensyon, Be sloe to speake let thy wordes be wittye, For, for a Damsell to haue manie wordes it is vnfyttie, Let loue and obedience in thy hart be fullye placed, Let contimelyous disdaine be vtterlye defaced Grudge not in ought againste thy fathers will, But be alwaies readie his mynde to fulfill, And showe thy selfe of a godly behauior, That of God and man thou maist merrit the fauor. Grissill. Mother all that you haue saide shall obserued be. Ianickel. Oh my deare wife how is it with the. Mater. Euen as it pleaseth God good husband Ianakell, But fleshe and blood is very fraile and britell, For such was the cause wherfore mankynd was framed. But hoap is my stafe which fleshly affectyon hath tamed, Where with throughe Christ my only iustificasyon, I striue ageinst sinne, death and, damnacyon, And euen amidste the bitter pangs of death, Whose gripes most sharp semd to close my breath, I appele to Christ for mercy and grace, Trustinge amonge his saintes in the heauens to haue place. Ianickel Alas poore man in creased is thy paine, Iust cause hast thou to languish and complaine. In. pouert Good neighbour I am hartely sory for your sycknes, But comfort your selfe brother Ianickell let goe your heauines. Grissill. Come on deare mother stay on my shoulder let vs depart this place, You shall want nothinge to comfort you with all. Mother. I know that thou wilt respeckt my case, How be it I am glad that death to me is befall, For now shall I as a pylgrim from pilgrims trauell be free, And throughe Chryst inioye heauenly felycite. Ianickle Well beinge fully furnished with anguish and paine, I will to my cottaige to comfort my wife this is plaine. Indigent And I will beare you companie with all festinasyon, Doinge all I may to turne to ioye your lamentacyon. Exiunt Politicke I mary now all is as it shoulde bee, Gods ye God morowe gam, I trow ye will saye that well nurtred I am. But yonder is such tidinges as will make you glad, The Marques for Mariage I trowe will ronne mad, For all his minde I tell you with out any lett, To prayse his spouse I promise you is set, Ye shall heare a none how he will lift hir vp to skies, As thoughe there were none more wittie vertuous or wyse, I can not blame him thoughe he comend his owne, But to none of his court the gentilwoman is knowne, And therfore to wonder there mindes I incence, So that euery man longeth to vew the Ladyes presence. Gautier. Oh so this hart doth longe, to spred my Ladies fame, And yet my tounge vnable is, to laude that worthie dame, For beautie I to Hellin maie, aptly the maid compare, Such vertues in a yonglings brest, is syldome seene or rare, A Phillis for hir costant truth, a Thisbe for hir loue, Hir arguments most pythie doe, hir vertues daylye proue. Politicke For beauty quoth you, is shee so amyable to the eye, Are hir vertues superaboundant that they can not be toulde I saye no more trackt of time the thinge shall trye. I thinke such a wife would very well be soulde, You maye coarse hir if it lyke you, and perhaps catch aworse, The pride of some dames make the husband beare an empty purse They must be trimmed after the trickest fassion, Fyne watters must be bought for beawties preseruasyon, There heare with abodkin muste be curld after the fynest guise, Ther Neates toungs with peakes must hange ouer ther eyes, And to make them seeme proper headid, fyne caps they haue, Such as will scantly couer the crowne, I thinke as God me saue, But to make them syt cleane I swere by Saynt tan, They cut of ther heare, as I am an honist man, Some bodye can tell that I vse not to lie, And I warant you ye shall some of these trickes in her espye, Fidence. Truth such pride in the world is now resident, As in no time the lyke hath bin seene with eie, Reason Many men and women I iudge are impudnte, For pride they imbrace with mindes full greedie. Sobrietie As God for pride did plauge Sodome and Gomora in hys yre. So will hee distroie the wicked with flaminge fyre. Gautier. I know that pryde imbrassed is, and some ther state exscead, But my ellected mate God knowes, with vice will not procead, She will obserue a modest meane, hir vertues shall increase, All hatfull hate in hyr shall end, she loueth perfyt peace, She feareth God, she dreads his name, she leades a Godly life, And dayly sekes for to subdue, contensyon and strife, She will as dutie byndes, hir spoused mate obaye, From husbandes heastes at no time she for any cause will straye. Politicke If shee bee so hollye a saynt as you make hyr, Refuse hyr I beseche you and I my selfe will take hyr, Such a Marriage would I haue, if I should chuse, Then should I be sure she would me not mysuse, I might saie what I would, and do what I list, Hee that hath such a wife of God he is blist, But moast wyues are so knappish and cutted now, That they will be knowen to beare rule I saie to you, Rule quoth I, yea and more then reason doth require, Yea and espesyally after that to mastership they aspire, Then hufe all a hoyh there tounges must be tauntinge, The flage in the topp mast, must neads be flauntinge, And now and then I swere by all hallowes, The nobsis be so nice that they will eat no mallowes, So coye are the minsinge muses, that drincke of bellonas well, That oft times they conquer ther husbands in battell, Yea and now and than I swere by this light, Betwext them on her part is proclaimed open fight, God send the graie mare good footinge and to amble apace, For now &amp; th? her t?c?maundem?ts are sene in the goodmans face Reason This talke from a mind malliscyous doth proceade, Therfore cease this vaine clatter, Politicke I tell you plaine yt some wiues recemble the cockatrice in dead. I speake plainlye I can not flatter, Thinke not that enuy doth giue me occasion, No there natures be knowen to Pollyticke perswasion, Trie them who will shall my words true fynde, Sume of them I tell you will be stoberne and vnkynde, Denye them of ther willes and then ye mar all, Ye shall see what there after is like for to fall, Ether brauling, iaulynge, sknappinge, or snarringe, Ther tounges shall not cease but alwaies be iarringe, Or els they will counterfait a kind of hipocrisye, And symper lyke a fyrmentie pot, the finger shalbe in there eye Theyle saie, loue is forgotten though my loue be showne, I see you loue another better then your owne, Tush, tush, I know full well theire meaninge and intent They be the craftiest cattell in Cristendome or kent. Fidence. Well set all these wordes a parte deare frend, Though some be froward all do not to frowardnes condissend, For I of Mariage know the iust probacyon, And dowtles my wife leadeth an honist conuersacyon. Politicke Yea but some times you giue hir, hyr owne will. Fidence. Yea and reason. Politicke Or els I warant you your ears with braulinges she wold fill, If the good wife should not some times beare all the stroake, Throughe out the house she would raise such asmoake, That ether bytterly hir tounge should ronne at large, Or els should hir eyes fountaynes of teares discharge, Tush whole bushels of teares fall from there eyes, The serrop were notable to sauer wardon pyes, But if selfe will were brydled, then men should lyue at rest, With womanlie acsyons they should not be opprest. Gautier. My subieckes now whose long desier, doth wish my Mariage daie Shall haue the thinge that they expeckt, with out longer delaye, Wherfore my knights your selues bedeck, in sumptuous araye, To solemnise with out all let, this longe desyred daye, Sobrietie Oh noble Lorde with willinge mind we graunt to do the same. Reason. We will apparell our selues, yt all the world shall speake of your fame Gautier. To morowe next I will featch home my spouse, Politicke By my troth if it lyke your honor she is a hansome blowse. Gyll sparow that milkt good man peatches Cowes, Gautier. I said I would fetch home my Ladie with celeritie, Sobrietie. And ile waight on you this is the veritie, Fidence. I will goe with you as dutie doth me binde, Politicke And I of your companie will be glad, And if I can euer an olde blankit fynd, I hoap for my parte to be hansomly clad, Reason What sayst thou. Politick. I saie after diner abanquit shalbe assynd, Notable faire in your Hall shalbe had. Gautier Come on let vs depert with spedines. Omnes. To doe as you will vs we be in a redynes. Exiunt. Politicke Nay fare ye well God be your speede, I tell you I come after as fast as I can, I am a goodlye fellow to help at aneed, Nay by myne honor I am a hansome seruinge man, Well I will goe poast to fetch home his wife, Whose vertues as hee saith are wonderfull ryfe, God dyld ge, God thanke ye, for my frendly companie, I must neads be packinge I swere by Saynt Antonye, Fare ye well, God be with you, gentill frendes adue, I am the properest fellow that euer man knew. Exiunt. Grissill. Ah Grissell now maist thou complayne, infortune thine (alasse) Thie tender dayes in deadly dole, thou now must learne to passe, For, thou haste lost a Iewell great, whose lyke is rare to finde, Whose want to waile, vnto thine eyes, a flood of teares is sinde: Thou now art motherlesse become, the graue hir lodge doth rest, Whose deth to mourne wt sobbing shrieks, &amp; sighs, yu now art prest Was neuer child had greater losse, nor cause of carking care, Helpe me to weepe all such (ah las) that carefull Children are: For I alacke do misse my ioye, and best instructris found, I rest aliue? but shee by death, lieth closed fast in ground. Wherfore ye Muses nine: that on Pernasso rest, Caleiope, Thersicora, and Clio, do your best: Strayne forth your noates of wailfull woes, weepe you &amp; mourne with mee: That Gods and men, my inward grief, apparant now may see. Here Grissell Singith a songe, to the tune of Damon &amp; Pithias. Can my poore harte be still, can I possesse sweete peace: When Ioue hath giuen Parchas the chardge, my blisfull ioyes to cease: Iudge you my cause, you tender youthes that gaynd your mothers loue, And you shall finde to mourne and weepe Dame Nature doth mee moue: My moother was my blisse, her sight did bannishe care: But now to weepe and mourne alacke, her absence I prepare: I misse her counsels sweete to mee, thrice blissed happie Dame: Who traynd mee vp in Uertues scoole, that I maye purchace Fame. And when that Atropos came stealyng on a pace, To see howe shee in tender armes her Grissell did imbrace: My teares like Fountaines rushed out, to shewe my grief and payne: Whose want to wayle in woofull wise Nature doth mee constrayne. But shee the heauens hath wone, and with the Saynctes doth raigne, In endles blisse wher Chryst our Lambe, doth hir reuyue againe, And I am left behynd to lyue, with my swete father deare, To whom whilst lyfe shall raigne in mee, obaysaunce I will beare. Finis. Exiunt. Enter two Lackyes. i. A syra my master is gone to my Lorde Marquis place, And I by his side haue poasted a pace, ii. And so haue I by mine, I swere by Gods mother, I warant the I sweate so that euery drope ouer taketh other, i. Gogs woundes let me se, sure herse a mad smell, All the place sauoreth of thy knaues grease I see well, ii. Gogs blood knaue, art thou knauinge by kynde, A greasier knaue then thy selfe, a man can not fynde i. Crie you mercy gentillman, can ye byde no borde Ile clap ye about the costerd with the hiltes of my sword, Art thuo knauinge of me, hence dissardly foole, ii. Guts I haue sene as wyse a man as you, wear a hood and a coloe, i. Am I a foole, goges harte Iacke sauce I shake you by the eares, Go prate with thyne equals you horson folish boye, ii. Gogs flesh, heares more a do wt Iacke Napes, th? tw?ty Beares, Alas goodman man you neede not be so coye, i. Blood shal I be flouted of a bagage boye, I ryd the hould thy prate But for wear?g my masters p?tapls I wold beat th? about thy pat ii. About my pate not a rush for the I do not care, Spare not me mast man but do what you dare, i. Then I will bob you you patch, for your mockes, ii. Be well assured thou shalt beare me some knockes. Exiunt. Grissill. Now that my spinninge ended is, and house full cleanly made, To voyde the gulphes of Idlenes, and vse some honist trade To well spring wher ye christall streames, of watters still in crease With prone and readie willinge minde, to go I may not cease, For I will fetch from thence wt speed, some dulsome water sweete And deyntie brothe for parent make, as fitlye is and meete, It is the dutie of a childe, hir fathers aidge to loue, To nourishe him as he dyd me, it doth mee now behoue, In armes full oft he lulled me, and foode me often gaue, Then why should I in any iot, of dutie him depraue, For God full straightlie hath giuen charge, to honor him a right, Which precept I will aye obserue, to vtmoast of my might, And hastelie from Well retourne, to comfort him with foode, Warme meates are meet for aged folke, to nourish vp ther blood. Enter Marquis, with hys Lordes. Come on with me ye worthie wights, which aye deserue renome, Ye Nobels all which aye restyd, with in Salutias towne, Most gratfullye I yeld you thanks, for this your taken paine, If God permit to lengthe my life, I will requit againe, Your frendly hartes with frendlynes, syth frendships fruts ye shoe The fulnes of the same in time, on you I will bestowe. Reason. As dutie byndes so loue constraines, vs on you to attend, Your honors gentill nature doth, such loue to vs extend, That loue inflames our gentill hartes, to honor you aright, And to aduaunce thy hie estate, to vtmoast of our might. Sobrietie Condinglie we to the O Lord, our offred seruise giue, Besechinge Ioue that sitst a boue, the heauens, you longe may liue In prosperous state to comfort ours, then shall our ioye in crease, And eke Salutias loue shall reap, through you the fruts of peace. Gautier. I giue you thankes assuredlye, from depth of secrit hart. Turne to the Ladies. Ye matrones all ye Ladies faire, lyke thankes I do impart, To you whose pregnaunt myndes, such clemencie bestowe, As doth belong to gentle hartes, lyke frendlines to showe: Wherfore Nature doth vrge me stil, to shew your worthie praise, Showne largelie to me youthfull wight, in these my tender dayes. Which thus much haue respected mee, to decke with rich renowne Your gouernour and onlie Lord, which rules Salutias towne, I meane in that ye readie are, attendaunce due to giue, And to featche home my mate elect, with whom in loue I liue. Let ther be .ii. or .iii. Ladies. Ladies Nomore but dutie we do shewe, wherfore your mynd content, To honor you with reuerence due, we Ladies all be bent. Grissill. Nowe that my Pot to brinkes I haue filled, I will haste mee home with all conuenient speede: God graunt I may do as my mother mee willed, Then God will prosper mee in tyme of neede, Let all Children bee mindefull of obedience in deede: Flye selfwill, which doth stoubbernes ingender, To honor your Parents do dayly remember: Be they neuer so poore or indigent, If God haue blessed thee with store and increase, Remember the paps of thy mother gaue thee nourishment, To feede and cloth thee, their care did neuer cease, Relieue and comfort theim, so end thy dayes in peace, If not looke for Gods scourge and curssed maledictyon: Which shall fall vppon thee, for thy stubberne infection, Well I will home with my water Pot without delaye, I would be loath to offende my father with longe tariaunce, For such as prouoke their frendes to yre day by daye, Can not escape Gods terrible vengeaunce. Gautier. God speede Damsell, soft whether awaye, Grissill. Trulye my Lorde homward, as fast as I maye. Gautier. Whear is your father, expresse to mee with speed. Grissill. In his poore Cottage hee resteth in deed. Gautier. Haste and tell him with all festinacion, That with him his Lorde will haue communicasion. Grissill. Your commaundement with speede performed shall bee, I will retourne quicklie, your honor shall see, Good Father be not offended with mee I you desire, Because so longe from you I haue bin absent. Ianickel. Ah daughter Grissell, why shouldest thou such athing require, Thou art retourned verie soone in my iudgement. Grissell Not so good Father, for comming by the waye, I had an occasion and was forced to staye: My Lord Gauter our gubernor excelent, Whom courteouslye I saluted, with wordes reuerent: Willed mee to haste home to my habytacion, Who stayeth hereby, with you to haue communicasion: Wherfore good father without lenger delaye, Let vs repaire to his presence as fast as wee maye. Ianickel O deare Childe I will haste to him with dilligence. Grissill God graunt hee maye relieue our indigence. Ianickle Oh honorable lorde, God sende thee felicitie, Thy hoare headdid subiect, thy person doth reuerence: Right worthye Lordes God blesse you with prosperitie, And sheeld you faire Ladies from all inconuenience. Gauter. Oh Ianicle wee thee regreet, againe in friendlye wise, That God protect both thee and thine, that sits in ethrall skyes: Incline thy aiged eares to mee, my loquie well perpend, Harke, marke and giue regard, to that I shall ostend: Requite my frendlye hart, and gratefie againe, Thy Lord which for thy Daughter here doth suffer extreme paine Who knoweth the panges of loue, or feeles hyr passyons dyre, What liuinge wight more then my selfe, abydeth Cupids ire, Such is the force of ardent fire, that boyles in secrit brest So seuer is the darted wound, with which I am oprest, That my poore bledinge hart doth faint, and comfort none can find, Except that you doe graunt a salue, to ease my dolefull mind. Ianakell O God who would haue thought, that such anoble hart, Would haue byn set on flaminge fyre, by blinded Cupids dart, Aswaige your fylthie lust, flye Uenus wanton wayes, O mortofie your appetite, doe nought regard hir plaies, Abhore hir carles court, hir muster Bookes eschue, So shall you quench that flaming fyre, which giues you cause to rue So shall you staunch the wound, wheare with your hart is paind, So shall no sparke of grefe be left, but parfyt health be gaind. Gautier. Know that I minde not to polute, the chast virginite, But rather seeke the losse of lyfe, to keepe integrite, I am not Uenus darlinge I, hir court I doe not vse, To be inrouled in hir Bookes, my sences all refuse, Hir bestiall playes I hate, hir pleasures fylthie are, Disloyall lust can not attempt, to trap me in his snare, But from profounded hart, doth perfit loue procead, Now condiscend to saue or spill, graunt mercie to my meed. Ianickell If case your loue be faithfull pure, your loue deserueth praise. Grissell Right suffraine Lord, respeckt your yonge and tender dayes, Your Noble state your dignitie, your honor and your name, Your worthie birth your parents race, atchiuinge troump of fame And eke lyft vp thine eyes, my poore degree behould, My poore estate my missery, the tyme doth forth vnfould, What better profe can be here of, then these our ragges so torne, These painte and shoe our penurie, which wee to bide were borne, These thinges full duely waid, in ballaunce equall right, Maye alter and infringe thy minde, and purposed delight, For they maie blemish quit, thy stocke and worthie race, Thy honor and thy ancetours, attonce they doe deface, Therfore goe chuse abetter choice, elleckt ameeter mate, Which may increase and ample make, thy worthie sanguine state. Gautier. Oh Grissill thee I loue, now length or short my lyfe, Let pittie now apere to be, with in thy brest full rife, It shall no whit abase my state, nor minishe my renowne, But cause thy fame thoundred forth, through out our royall towne What shall each wight report of the, if rigor thou now vse, If my vntymly death thou haste, canst thou thy selfe excuse? A murdres thou shalt termed be, all men shall the disdaine, Which cruelly with out deserte, thy only Lord hast slaine, An Iphis I whose kindly hart, doth begge and craue thy grace, If thou Anaxaretis be, and turne from me thy face, Poore Teucers sonne is then for lorne, the Troyan is vndone, If Iphis I doe play my part, contempt thou canst not shonne, Thy pouertie can nought preuaile, thy rigor to obscure, But rather cause and styr each wight, disdaine to put in vre Thy ragged clothes the argue not, in poore estate to lyue, Thy vertues noble doe the make, such Fate doth Fortune giue, That thou aboue all virgins art, by troump of Fame extould, Giue rightfull Dome to Pyramus, lyke Thisbe loue vnfould. Ianickel. My Daughter is a Uirgin puer, and wanteth terren store. Gautier. For that respeckt doth faithfull loue, in me increase the more. Grissill. Much musinge in my minde, in this sort I replye, Why should you seme me wretched wight, to loue thus faithfullye I nether haue faire Helins shape, nor comly shininge hew, Ne yet no kinde of earthy quoine, ne substaunce this is true, And as for costlie ornaments, and sumptuous araye, I want, the best euen now on me behould you maye, Ther restes within this noble Towne, fulmanie a worthy dame, Which both for store &amp; feature fayre, deserues the voice of Fame: They may you hie renowne augment, and eleuate to skies, Take one of them, my lowe estate and Parents stocke dispise: Let Grissell with her father liue, bestowe on them your loue, This answere take? wt equall state learne now your sute to proue: Bee Iphis true to such a one, as plentie hath and store, Chuse like to like leaue of for shame, expresse thy sute no more. Gautier. Oh carelesse youth yt nought regardst, my plaints &amp; dolfull teares Oh dyrfull daye, oh haples hap, oh shortner of my yeares: Oh praye appoynted for my death, which lightly doste regard The life of him, which thou with loue shouldst gratfully reward: Insunder breake thou hart, which thus with greef art tost, Yeld vp thy breath from Prison free, thy poore tormented ghost: Whie shouldst thou lenger liue, to coutch on heapes thy payne: I loath my life, sith my good will doth reape my selfe disdaine, If euer ruth did rest, within your rufull hartes, Streame forth your plaintes ye Muses al, with teares bewaile my smartes: Take Welspringes to your eyes, let dolfull tunes abound, Oh pearce and fill the hawtie clowds, with your lamenting sound: Shewe forth my faithfull hart, be records of my loue, These plaintes throwne forth, my constancy apparantly do proue, Oh Ianickle whose aige, ought honored to bee, If case that Nature in the rest, I praye thee pittie mee. Ianickle If that these teares streamed forth, from depth of hart proceed, And I shall graunt to giue thee grace, to recompence thy meed: Plight faith and troth to mee: thou wilt not her deflower, Ne spoyle her Garden fragarant, of Uirins fruitfull flower. Gautier. To record Heauen I call, and God that liues therin: Plighting my faith in open prease, to shunne such filthy sinne, I mynd not as a Harlot I, with her to lead my life, But by the force of wedlocks knot, to take her as my wife. Ianickell Then to your honor I, my daughter deare do giue: Beseeching God that in his feare, together you may liue. Gautier Oh happie bee thy aiged life, and fortunate I praye, Which hast preserued thy louing Lord, from daunger and dekaye: Welcome to mee my mate elect, my ioye and harts delight, The perfect length of vitall life, which greef extirpest quite. Grissill. Sith it hath pleasd you louinge Lord, to fix your loue on mee, Faith, Loue, and obedience due, I yelde here vnto thee. Gauter. These giftes more precious are then Goulde, And farre excell all terren treasure: Oh it delighteth mee much thee to behould, In thy presence consisteth my solace and pleasure. Tourne to Ianicle. Grissell Ahlas) poore sillie girle increased is thy smart, From father nowe in aiged dayes, perforce thou must departe, Who now in time of neede, shall thy estate releeue? To leaue thee destitute of helpe, thy daughter sore doth greeue, Who now shall roule thy backe, and daylie giue thee food: I knowe not one that readilie, will do my father good, If that thou pine, I pine like case, I dye if ought thou want, To wend from thee thus sodainlye, my dollors are not scant, Who now shal kembe thy hoary beard, who now shal wash thy hed Who nowe to ease thy aiged bones, shall beat and make thy Bed. Ianickell Comfort thy selfe my childe, for mee God will prouide, Hee is my Rocke, my stafe, my stay, my trust and perfect guid, And sith that hee by prouidence, respected hath thy state, And to the top of Fortunes wheele, in mercie eleuate, Lament no more, distill no teares, though thou departe mee froe, For God that rules both heauen and earth, hath wild it shold be so: Swell not in Pride still gentel bee, and lead a lowlye mind, To all estates full curtious bee, as Nature hath assind. Grissell I will obserue your heastes, to vtmoaste of my might. Ianickell Then God will blesse thee with his grace and sprite. Gauter. My Ladies all I you requir, my comly spouse araye, That we maye haste to solemnise, our happie wedding daye, These ornamentes receiue, to decke her corpes with all. Ladies Right worthye Lorde in euery poynt, fulfill your mynd we shall: Come Ladie mine to fathers house lead vs the readie waye. Grissell I yeald ye matrons to your heast, come on with mee I praye. Exiunt. Ianickel Right honorable Lorde gyue thy seruaunt licence, To shewe my mynde at large vnto thee. Gautier. Good father shewe forth the fulnes of thy sentence, Without lenger let I hartely pray thee. Ianickel If God pourforth on you the Oyle of his Uncsion, And with fertillitie thy Uineyard increase, I meane if hee ad his spirituall benediction, And giue you children bringe theim vp in his peace, Instruct them to feare God, and their Parents to obaye: Then God will preserue theim from ruinous decaye, Keepe theim alwayes vnder lawfull correction: Restraine in them, swearing, and all vngodlynes, Chastice and ponish them, lest sinfull infection, Alure them to all mischife and wickednes, So shall God prosper you wyth his spirit and grace, And they as he hath promised, shall on earth long ronne their race: Loue one another, the seedes of Enmitie eschewe, For whear as faithfull Loue is remanent, Theare Hatred is subdued, this is moast trewe: And Gods feare is euermore with such couples resident, But whear as is the contrarie, I meane strife and Uariaunce: Theare the Deuil is head, and hath the hole gouernaunce. Gautier Father thinke not that obliuion shalbe frequentid, Godwilling all that you haue sayd shalbe attemptid: For wheare Children are not ponished for their sinne, Theare mischife to springe doth fully beginne: Theare Oathes abound, theare Lies moast odious, Begin to take roote, as hurtfull and pernicious: If Nature be corrupted with poysoned infection, Then resteth there Gods cursse and heauie maledicsion, Therfore in tender yeares, while youth is greene and fresh, All lewd inormities a Rod maye redresse: Lest further inconuenience, in aige happen to growe, As is seene of such as wyckednes do followe. Reason In deede a man maye bowe a Twigge which way he liste, So in Infancie a Childe with good manners furnished, In aige in Uertue will willingly persist, And such a one of God is surelye blissed. Sobrietie. Children chasticed in Infancie, in aige flie sinne, But if Parents cloake their godlesse conuersacion, In the end to contemne their superiours they beginne, Thefore correction bringeth them to good educasion. Ladies. Low noble Lorde haue wee long bin absent. Gauter No trulye and therfore I am the better content. Grissell O noble Lord, these costlye Robes, vnfitly seeme to bee: My ragged weed much more then this, doubtles contented mee. Gauter These garmentes nowe to thine estate belong, my Lady deare, Disdaine them not, but for my sake refuse them not to weare. Ianickll Set Gods feare before thyne eyes good Grissell. Grissell Your heast shalbe obserued good father Ianickel, But my harte is much pained to depart thee froe. Ianickell Reioyce for needly from mee thou must goe. Grissell Receiue this frendly kisse, so nowe God bee thy ayd. Ianickell Faynt not for on him all my care is laide. Gauter. Come let vs depart with all celeritie, Sound vp your Instrumentes, be ioyfull Nobillitie? And in token of Uictorie, some Song I will singe, Which to performe Ladie, I must haue your helpinge. Grissell Begin when you please my Lord, for with a willing mind, To helpe you all I maye, redie ye shall me finde. Singe and then go out. To the tune of malkin. Marques Syth Fate and Fortune thus agree, My onlie ioye and Ladie deare: A Romeo I will rest to thee, In whome the fruites of Faith appeare: Heigh hoaw, my true loue, I ioye in thee my Turtell Doue. Grissell Sith heauenly Gods that rule aboue, Haue lotted mee to be your wife: A Thisbe iust thy spowse will proue, Whilst Ioue giue chardge to end my life: Heigh hoaw, my sweete hart, I honor thee, while death vs part. Marques Lowe, heare thy Lord doth thee imbrace, Whose sight farre dearer seemes then life: Within my brest thou gainest place, Welcome to mee moste louing wife: Heigh hoaw, my true loue, I phancie thee, my Turtell Doue. Grissell No Tarquins knight, ne Appian now, Shall cause mee shrinke from duetie due, Penellope, Ile stande to you, As Lady iust and faithfull true: Heigh hoawe, my sweete hart, I am thine owne, while death do part. Marques Thy Uertues seeme no lesse to bee, With Alcest fayre compare you maye: Thy modest life inflamed mee, To ioyne and knit this knot to daye, Heigh hoaw my true loue, I am thyne owne my Turtell Doue. Not Cressus gould nor Midas mucke, My phancye fyxt may seeme to chainge, Diana doth me still in strucke, To Venus knightes aye to be strainge, Heigh hoaw my sweet hart, I honor the while death vs parte. Finis. Gautier. Fare well to thee good father Ianickle. Ianickell God giue your honor ioy, of my daughter Grissell, The Lorde bee with you, and both your loues increase, And graunt you to end your dayes in his peace: I can not but wonder to see the inflamation, Of Loue, which here fully hath showne her operacion: Prouokinge this Marques nourished in prosperitie, To loue poore Grissell tasting so much pouertie, But it is thy prouidence my God, that this to passe hath brought, By thy deuine wisdome this acsion was wrought. God bee their defence and keepe them from domaige: Well I will leaue musinge and go to my cottaige. Exit. Politicke Nowe Polliticke Perswasion, nowe or els neuer, Phie, for chaffing I can skant keepe my teeth to gether, I tell you I haue found out such an inuension, As among the common sort, shall kindle discencion: A Marquis maried to a beggerlye Grissill, Her father an olde foole, and an impotent criple, His store and substaunce in value not worth twentie pence, This geare cannot chuse but breed inconuenience, I will not cease priuely her confusion to worke, For vnder Honnie the prouerbe saith poyson maye lurke: So though I simulate externally Loue to pretend, My loue shall turne to mischife, I warrant you in the end: The pretie foole is puft vpp, her belly is bigge, I coniecture the trull will bringe forth some proper Pigge: Enter Reason and Sobrietie. Reason In publicque toyle in countries straunge, full often I haue been, Wher Matrones chast &amp; Ladies faire, these earthy eyes haue seen: But nowe for wisdoms obsequies, to Grissill I compare, To saye the truth hir modest life, and vertues are moste rare. Sobrietie You saye the truth for onlye shee, all men confesse the same, For curtuous facts and loquie milde, deserues a worthye name. Politicke Oh so these gentlemen praise and lift her to the skyes, I could finde in my hart to plucke out the beggers brats eyes: Phie ont, it greeueth mee to the verie hart, A Ladie honorable, naye a Whippe and a Cart: Bones heres stuff if the worlde were quicke, These yonkers with auengeaunce, are come in the nicke, I will to them I, to put my practise in vre, My countenaunce shalbe graue, sad and demure. God speed gentlemen ye are welcome hether, Me thought of Grissell I harde you common together: Praysynge her for Uertues, such as bee seene but rare, To commend her so highly very much to blame ye are: I knewe her ofspringe I, from the beginning, Is shee anie more then a Beggers brat, brought vp in spinning, Her father is indigent, needie, and lame, An old doatinge foole, that Ianickle hath to name: In her ther is no iot of noble sanguinnite, Therfore vnfitly that her seed should rule or haue dignitie. Reason. Content thy mynd thy talke is vaine, thou seekst to heap vp strif, I can not chuse but needs commend, hir good and honist lyfe, Aboue all spoused Dames, which byde within this towne, She best deserues the price of prayse, and Helme of rich renowne. Sobrietie. The Scorpion forth will flinge, his poyson to anoye, And passingers that passe him bye, with Uennome to distroye, So thou whose mallice doth abound, thy stinge doste now prepare, To vex and harme those wightes, whose liues most vertuous are. Politick. Not I for twentie pound, will hurt hir by the Rood: That which I haue spoken is sure the veritie, If I could hurt hyr yet would I do her good, Because ye extoll her for perfect integritie, But I had rather shee wer hanged by saint Antonie: I would she were slaine or banished the countrie, Politicke What sayst thou. Reason It is good to vse such honest companie. Dilligenc God saue you my Lordes, whose honors be excellent, My Lorde Gautier for you both hath sent, And desireth you to haste to him with out delaye, For my Ladie his wife is deliuered this daye, Of abewtifull Childe amyable to behould. Sobriete Oh happie day, oh tidinges sweete, our ioyes can scarce be tould. Reason Incontinent wee readye are, with thee from hence to wende. Dilligenc Lead you the waye right worthye Lords, on you I will attende. Pollitcke Fare ye well gentle gentill men, God be your speede, Brought a Bed all readie, they haue plyed the box in deed, I dare saye it is some pretie mophedid twigge, Its meruell shee brought not a litter, for hir bellie was bigge: Well let this passe, nowe this gere to cotten doth begin, Let them laffe in the end that the victorye doth winne: Sith my former deuice, is thrust to exemption, And that I cannot preuayle with rancor and contencion: I will frequent through pollicie, another meane, Wherwith I will molest and distroye her cleane, I will trye her pacience, another kynde of waye: Let mee see euen so, it shallbe I swere by this daye, Peace conceale thy purpose as yet Polliticke perswacion: Till such time as thou see farther occasion, Not a word more my Lorde Marques entreth the place, Nowe maist thou contriue thy drift within short space. Enter Marques Singing to the tune of the latter Almain. Marques I Liue in ioyfull iollytie, With my true loue and Ladye deare: To mee shee gyueth loyaltie, For Uertuous acts shee hath no peare: So true, so iust, in worde and deed, I maye her trust, in time of need: Hir gentill harte through Wisdomes arte, So curtuously doth playe her parte: That needs I must expresse hir prayse, Till direfull death cut short my dayes. Finis. Ye Heauens and powers deuine, which did predestinate, To mee your creature framd of slime, such hap and luckie Fate: As tendeth still to vrge mee forth, your praise to eleuate, Moste happie bee the time that I elected such a mate: Whose louing hart excelleth farre, Salutias Noble Dames, Hir Godly hart is cleane bereft of vaine and wanton games: A Dido for her Chastitie, Penellope for truth, A Thisbe for her ardent loue, and Pyramus insueth: Cassandra shee for pacyence, full aptly maye be namde, Amonge the rout of chasted Dames, my Matrone may bee famde: Whose vertues farre abound, and sandie shores excell, From Courtlie Dames for counsell graue, my spouse doth beare ye bell. Politicke God ge goddeauen my Lorde wyth all my hart, If your wyfe be so vertuous as nowe ye import, Surelie, surely shee is worthy commendacion, Shee may be made a saynte for her good conuersacion: But harke my Lorde nay nowe harken in your eare, Try hir that waye and by myne honestie I sweare, You shall see hir decline from Uertues so rife, And alter topsie turuie hir saintish lyfe: Hir pacyence quicklye shall chaunged bee, I warrant your honor will say it is not shee. Gauter As sure as God doth lyue, and sitt in heauen aboue, So sure will I in euery poynt, this thy deuice approue: Therfore call in with speede, my seruaunt Dilligence, That of this act, wee maye giue him intelligence. Politick. Your will shalbe performed without delaye, Hoaw Messenger, this place appropriat. Dilligenc Who calleth for mee, I am here by this daye, What is thy will? thy pleasure intimate. Politicke Haste thee incontinent to my Lordes presence, Dilligenc That to do I am in a readines. Politicke See that his person thou honour and reuerence, Dispatch horson Dreamer, go forward with speedines. Dilligenc Soft fyre the common Prouerbe saith, sweete Malt doth make. Politicke The matter requireth haste, hence thy passaige take. Dilligenc God saue your honor and graunt you his grace. Gautier. Messynger thou art hartely welcome to this place, I haue secrit thinges to thee to inculcate, Giue dilligent eare, marke what I ostentate: Thou knowest Grissill, my Ladie and wife, With whom in Loue and Feare I haue lead my life: Farther thou knowest my Daughter, which shee doth nourish, And with the Mylke of her brestes foster and cherishe, I will that thou make semblant, at my commaundiment, With thy swerde in sonder, to deuide that Innocent, Yet shalt thou not hurte it, but to Bullin Lagras it conuaye, To the Countise of Pango my sister, without let or staye, Who will nourish it and giue it sustentacion: And bring hir vp in Godlye and honest conuersacion. Politicke To this messaige you must take good regarde, Be well assured, thou shalt not lose thy rewarde. Dilligenc All that to mee in charge, you now committed haue, Shalbe performed in all the haste, els God my soule ne saue. Gautier If thou to anie wight that lyues, these Nouels showne disclose. Pollitcke Gefferye Grimston at midnight, Shall plucke thy bowells throughe thy Nose. Gautier. My fauourable loue thy selfe for aye, shalt surelye lose. Pollitcke For thy behauor horson elfe, thine eares shalt surelye lose. Dilligenc God let mee neuer liue on earth, his vengeance heape my woe, If I to any lyuing wight this secrit charge do shoe: And as for this committed act, with all conuenient speede, These handes shall straight prepare, to excecute the deede: With violence the babe to pull from armes my hart is prest, Thus then the mothers harte with care &amp; grief shall be distrest, For I will fayne that blooddie sworde, shall sonder and deuide, And scortch the Inf?ts t?der corps, with wo?ds both large &amp; wide. Politicke Peace not a worde but gossip for twentie pound, Your Spouse with her Nurse and Childe, Enter into place, You must counterfaite that Doller may amply abound: Let tricklinge teares be nowe dystyld apace. Gauter. Your counsell graue to imitate, moste willingly I will, I am decreed in euery poynte, your heast for to fulfyll: To teares my ioyes I nowe deuert, my lookes shall meastfull bee, No kynde of solace nowe shall seeme, to bide or rest in mee: My vigur and my feature faire, sault teares with spopts shal staine And wofull playnts shall forth ostende, my plight &amp; pensyue payne. Grissell Come on my Nours how doth our Child, I praythe forth expresse. Nurs The Child no dout hir perfit helth, hath such is Gods goodnes. Grissell God blesse the lyttill one, and sheld the with his grace, Eeke graunt thee helth and long to ronne, on earth thy vitall race, My Lorde and spoused mate, recydeth here in place, Him to salute as dutie byndes, I will procead a pace. Nurs And I will to his presence goe, perhapes to get some gaine, For sylly Nurses with yonge Babes, do watch and take much paine, Thy smilynge lookes will gratulate, and heape thy fatheres ioye, God graunt the grace &amp; the preserue, from Gulphes of grefes anoy. Grissell God spead my Lord moast honorable, Why are you pensyue what greefe doth you betide, Be of good cheare shoe your selfe comfortable, Set sorowe and sadnes my Lord cleane aside. Politicke Bones howe now how standeth the case, In faith Dame thy sorowes do hast them a pace. Nurs Oh my Lord behould your Daughter deare, how pretly shee doth smyle Hir pretie lookes your tristfullnes, with ease maye cleane exile. Gautier. A way Nours these wordes are all to gether vaine, They minishe not but more and more augment my paine, The cause of doler is so great that grefe doth still a bounde, No kynde of ioye to ease my woe, can none for me be found, The heauiest hap that euer chaunste, is now to me be fall, Was neuer Lord so tost with paine, nor pinched to the gall, Oh cruell wightes, that cause my care, oh stonie harts of flint, Can neuer teares nor dolfull paints, cause rigor for to stynt, But that ye will proscead to worke your curssed will, Aboue all grefes this grefe surmounts, an Infants bloode to spyll. Grissell O shoe to me thy mated wife, the thinge that causeth care, And I to swage thy pensyue mind will remedie prepare. Gauter Thou canst not ad relefe my deare, if I the thinge repeate It rather will torment thy minde with painfull passions great The cause is this? my nobles my weeded state disdaine, And ether will that I poore wretch, an exill shall remaine, And lose my rullinge state, my treasure and my store, Which luckles hap in gushing kind, with teares mine eyes deplore, Or els that our sweete childe, which from these loynes ishude, with dirful sword, shold murthred be, which th?g my hart hath rued Now to auoid ther wrathfull yre, and fauor wynne againe, I graunt and yeld that this our Chid wt sword shall straight be slain Grissill. Oh Lord my God what words are these they fill my hart wt woe, Ah silly wretch, must thou thy Childe thus rufully for goe, Would God in poore estate poore Grissill had remaind, Then void of cause thy tender hart, with woe had not bin paind, Ye matrons milde deplore my case, take fountaines to your eyes Oh let your clamors penitrat, the hawtie clowded skyes, My Child alas in Childhode nowe, subiected to the sworde, O ruthles hartes which hir to kill doe cruellie accorde, What hart would condiscend, to reaue the of thy lyfe, Who would consent to scortche thy fleshe, with cruell cut of knife, This chaunce with pacience, I will sustaine and beare, God will reuenge this bloody fackt, in end I nothinge feare My Lord the Daughter is your owne, with hir attompt your will, If it seme pleasant to thy hart, thy pleasure now fulfill, Gautier Then take with speed thy glitring sword, procead &amp; play thy part End thou hir race fulfil ther minds, straight gorg hir through ye hart. Dilligenc Alouffe thou Dame giue me the Childe, a waie and get the hence. Nurs Alas my Lorde be mercifull, commit not such offence, Consider how that God, whych rules the hawtie skyes, Eache litill thought for to be houlde, hath opened wyde his eyes, And how then can so great a facte, from him concealed be, Which doth the thoughs of euery wight, discerne and plainly see, Can murder then from him be close, no no my Lord not soe Ther is a God which to reuenge, this act will not be sloe, Perpend attend and giue regard, to that which he hath sayde, Thou shalt not kyll, let this procept of the be rightlye waid, Now if thou condecend thy flesh with death for to torment, Thou canst not scape Gods wratfull yre, and greuous ponishment. Gauter. O Nours leaue of such talke, in vaine thou spendst thy breath, Yt is not I that yeld my Child to stroacke of grissly death, But spitfully my commons now, are inly puft with hate, And goe about to short my life, such is my haples state, For ether I from dignitie, shal straight exempted be, And abieckt like bee throwne from rule such hap is chauncst to me That in exile as bannished I euer shall remaine. Or els in hast deliuer them this younglinge to be slaine, And rather then from natiue towne, I Gautier will goe, Not my swet babe but onlye I, will life and breth for goe, Therfore leaue of thy teares, thy plaints can fynd no grace. Politicke Tush folish woman this is a heauie case, Better were it for him to haue the Childe slaine, Then his owne person should suffer such paine. Nurs Yet Noble Lorde if nature seme in the to haue aplace Preserue thy Childe from death, end not hir vitall race, The Tyger that in Wildernes, doth fead and ay remain, Will to the vtmoast of hir might, hir yonge ones sheeld from paine The rauenous rampyng Lion will, hir whelps from dainger saue The sauaidge Beare with shape defournd will close in secrit caue, And often licke and cherish them, accordinge to hir kinde, Till clad with heare, and vglye shape, she lyke hir self them finde, Then sith that beastes which reason want, ther proper ones defend Much more should m?, which wisdom hath for his own flesh c?tend. Dilligenc Cease for I will share with sword, the Infants corpes by force, Ne on thy plaints nor on his teares I mind to take remorse. Politicke Bodie a God this a Dicke for the nonce by the roode, Hele doote hee, and hee saye the worde, I warant you full soone the yonglings hart bloode, Hele searche and pearce with his glittringe sworde, Tut I promise you this youncar is one of them that God bad whoe, For with him though I sayt, thers but aword and a blowe. Gautier. I graunt yt beastes preserue by toile, ther yonglings from all woe But if I should attempt the same, I should my life forgoe, What botes it one though rule he beare, to take a sword in hand, A thousand armed fightinge men, to vanquishe or with stande, I then my life should lose, each wight my bloode would spill, Yet my death could not qu?ch ther thirst, but they wold haue there will And then should Childe and Father both, be slaine on bloody sword, Yet first that she be slaine, my sences all accorde. Maid, Alas my Ladie and Mistres must haue a heuy hart, To see hir Child subieckt to such painfull smart. Nurs Oh do not so but condiscend, and graunt my poore request, And suffer not with violence, thy babe to be distreste, Giue me the Childe I praye, and saue hir from thes fone, For I will fead and nourishe hir, and take hir as mine owne These brests shall bringe hir vp these handes shall fynd hir food, I will not cease but carefull be to fend hyr guiltles bloode, Thus doing thou shalt stop the mouthes, yt would the babe deuoure Thus doinge she shalbe preserud, hir fooes shall haue no powre, To hasten this vntimlie death, and dirfull heauie fate, And they against that mightfull Ioue, no crime shall perpetrate, For I from hence will take my flight and hence be cleane exilde, This will I do oh worthie Lord, for safgarde of thy Childe, Gauter. Let be these words they more in crease my paine. Politicke Nay nay with out all doubts the Chylde shalbe slayne, Dispatch hyr speedely cease all thys pratlynge. Dilligenc To sunder hir bodie I straight will take paine, The safgarde of hir life hath causd this longe tatlinge. Make as you would kill it. Gautier. Nay stay thy hand good frend, conuaye hir out of place, For nature will not let me see, hir slaine before my face, But I shall yeld vp breth, and vitall lyfe soone end, Therfore from out our syghtes I praye, the hastely doe wend. Dilligenc All shall be done right sufferain Lord, as now you haue me willed I will not cease till rigoruslie, hir bloode with sword be spilled. Nurs Nay I will follow perhapes my mornfull petiscyon, May cause him to leaue his sinfull intensyon. Exiunt. Politicke Bones how lyke you this gere, the Nurs is gone after, I can not blame you if ye morne for your Daughter. Grissill Oh God my God what rigor now, haue subiects gaynst vs vsed Alas my woe increaseth much, how is my Lord abused, Nay rather how doth Nature vrge, me meastfully to waile, To see how cruell destinie, against me doth preuaile, My Daughter reft from tender Paps, alas my wofull paine, And causleslie by Tyrants fearce, with bloodie sword thus slaine, Fare well swet Childe thy Mother now, shall se thy face no more, Helpe spoused Dames help Grissill now, hir fate wt teares to plore Gushe forth your Brinie streames let tricklinge teares abound The earth and Fyrmament aboue, fyll with your mornfull sownd My Child alas in swadlinge clouts, bereft and slaine with sword. Lord help, Lord ayd, my wofull plight on me take some remord, Albeit such dirfull hap haue chauncst, graunt pacience to my paine That I maye seme this crosse of thine, with ioye for to sustaine, How now my louing Lord reuiue your heauie minde, Come goe with me to solace you, some ioye shalbe assinde. Gautier. Beloued mate, whose wiflie troth the sandie Seas excell, I graunte to excequte such things as you shall forth refell. Pollitick Bodie a God what woman here cold take the matter so pacient But rather pourforth teares hir doler to complaine, Yet she semeth with this fact to be well content, Thoughe that hir Childe be murthered and slaine. Grissill Come on my mate let vs from hence to pastimes sport now w?d, Gautier. To go with you assuredlye, my loue I do in tend. Exiunt Politicke Ah syra are you all gone. Is Politicke Perswacion left here alone, Well then wher art thou horsone awake or a slepe, I thinke thy wittes be gone goslings to kepe, Whop quoth I to my sheep, and had neuer a one, Bodie and heres an emptie head, for all the wit is gone, Let me see, euen so now lo, I haue that I sought, How lyke you my pollicies how wyslie haue I wrought, Nay rather how like you hir constancie and pacience, Truly that is wounderfull stronge in this inconuenience, But as I haue begon so will I afflict hir still, I am kyn to a wo?an in all poynts ile haue my will, Fare ye well no remedie I must depart, Fare well God be with you my Pigges nie with all my hart, If you had Grissills pacyence and condiscyons excelent, You and I would make a match to marye incontinent. Exit Countes, Of Pango I the Countis am, my praise doth splendish bright, Be loued I am for iustice cause, of euery faithfull wight, But one thinge, heapes on heapes, our grefe and dolefull paine And giues vs cause in gushing kinde, with teares to waile &amp; plaine How spitfully hath death delt now, with me moast wofull wretch, What ment you destenies so dire, your hands thus forth to stretch And merciles to giue such doome, as works a Ladies woe, Forsynge me my faithfull mate, so soone for to for goe, Why rather reft ye not, my file by force in twaine, Your hatfull yre with rigor mixt, to morne doth me constraine Maid, Comfort your selfe my Ladie deare, let sorowes now decreace It is longe time since that he died therfore your teares do cease Can teares giue life, or him restore to former life againe, No, why then do you most meastfully for him your mate complain I iudge that God displeased be, with thys your heauy mone, His race was ronne leaue of your pla?ts for God wil haue his own Countis My heauie minde you comfort much, but nature shoes hir kynd, Pango For shee hath welsprings to mine eyes, to morne his death assynd, His loue his faith so fully showne, to me his spoused mate, Doth giue me cause to poure out plaints, to shoe my haples fate, But who is that that now to vs hasteth thus a pace. Maid A messinger my Ladie faire, this is the sertaine case. Dilligenc God saue and preserue you my Ladie amiable, And lengthen your lyfe with prosperous increase, Your brother Gautier my Lord most honorable, Doth wishe your helth with quiet rest and peace, Whose loue to the world shall neuer cease, He hath sent you here his Daughter young to cherishe, Which he with Dilligence, doth trust you will nourishe, And to trye the pacience of hys Ladie and wife, This acsyon dowbtles was attempted, For shee thinketh that the sword hath reft the babe of life, Now therfore sith my Lord this triall hath frequented, He desyreth your honor, as loue trixt you hath euer bin ostendid To conceale and kepe seccrit this his intent, And let it not be knowne but that it hath felt deathes dent.

Nurs O cruell father, O most intollorable case, In the brest of this Marquis Nature hath no place, Neyther canst thou before God, thy selfe excuse That seemest such tirannie to thy flesh to vse, To murther thy children, inlargeth my care: To perseuer in sinne thy selfe thou doste prepare, But wo to thee woe, whom the beastes do excell, That in the desertes continuallye do dwell: The Lionis her whelpes, doth earnestly tender, The Bear to her young ons in loue is not slender, But thou to thy owne flesh art father vnkynde, To crye out against thee, poore Nursse I do mynde. The venemous Serpent the Crocodill most dire, To bring vp her young hath carefull desire: The mercilesse Tiger deuoide of all fauor, To nourish her younglinges doth earnestly labor, But thou (alas) disdaynest thy flesh for to feed, Thou rather delightest to make their hartes bleede. Two Children to death, thou nowe haste condemned: But knowe that the Lord, thou hast greatlye offended, I mourne thee poore Grissill, thy hap I lament, But thou in this case art merueilous pacient: To court I will haste mee, to comfort thee all that maye bee, But to crye out on the Marquis I will not delaye mee. Exit. Politicke Ah sira I haue toucht hir I troe, Polliticke Perswacion hath giuen Grissell abloe, Abloe quoth you? such a one as sorow myght in crease, But by his Bones hir mourninge doth cease, Yet she thinketh hir lyttill sonne is slaine, But my pollices disceaue hir this is plaine, For it is sent to Bullin Lagras the truth is so, To the Marquis sister, the Countis of Pangoe, Who will nourish it, as it is well knowne, As she doth his Daughter, which is kept as his owne, But sith that nether of these attempts hir pacience can moue, I am minded ageinst hir a new assault to proue, Which shall exempt hir from the top of fortunat prosperitie, And plounge hir deepe in the floods of aduersytie, Behould yonder they enter both to gether, Suerly I minde to giue hir, hir welcome hether, God saue your honors may I be bould with you my Lord to haue a word or twain Truly for your profit I wold speake wt you faine.

Grissell Am I the springe that vexeth thee, my louinge Lord declare. Grissill Hath wiflye troth aye fayled thee, hath dutie bin neclect, Doth anie wight that liueth nowe, of these thynges mee suspect, But if I be the cause, that reaues thee of thy ioye: If I bee shee oh noble Lord, that worketh thyne annoye, As my sweete Babes at Tirants heast, haue died on blooddy knife, To swaige their raige, &amp; win thee grace: spare not thy faithful wife Let thousand gasshes scortch this flesh, let them their raige displaye, Let thousand woundes by stroake of kniues, take Grissills life away Politicke Bodie of mee see her gentill disposed mynde, Howe manie such wiues maye a man fynde: Whiche seeyng their husbands oppressed with woe, Would willingly offer their liues to forgoe, To mittigate the husbands paine, or ease his greef: Not one I coniecture I am so harde of beleef.

Politicke Bones quod ioyner who made God all mightie, These newes will vex and greue hir spitfullye, To be banished so soddainly from hir husbands side, And he to marrye another, clockinge Mistris Bride Would moue the pacience of a good manye wyues, I dare saie they had rather be ryd of their lyues. Grissell Most humble here my sufferaigne Lord, thy listn?g eares prepare Attentiuelie giue good regard, to that I shall declare, When I in poore estate did liue, ther with I was content, I praisd my God, and bare the crosse, that he to me had sent Lyke case when that to this estate, your mate ye did eleckt My loe degree this choice of thine, vnfittie did suspeckt, I thought that twixt my vacant plight, and neadfull indigence, Thy rych estate, and Lordly rule, deseruinge reuerence, Might no comparisson be made, and therfore as vnmeete, I dempt my selfe within thy roofe to place or set my feete, Yet dyd thine honor noble Lord, elekt me for thy mate, The gretter ruth the more my paine, and most vnhappie Fate Fyrst both my babes dysmembred are, the sworde their flesh hath torne Next causlesly to cruciat me, new troubles they adorne, Which pacientlie I wofull wife, of women all forlorne, Will byde and beare laffinge my fooe, fond Fortune all to skorne, But if this bannishment, and absence of thy wife, And twixt the Lordly sort and thee, end this conceaiued stryfe, I graunt with willinge minde, from hence to take my passadge, And rest me as I did tofore, with in my fathers cottadge.

Politick. What bodie a me, my Lord plucke vp your hart, Be frollicke and ioyfull set sorowes aparte, Are you not ashamed to blubber and weepe, It is time now to playe the man, and not a symple sheepe, Procead forward faint not, your purpose prosequte, Be not reputed acoward, the fackt excequte, Let your countenaunce be sterne, like agentillman looke byg, Els for this drift ile not giue afyg. Marquis Followinge the mosyons of Polliticke Perswasion, Against hir stowtly I will make inuasion. Politicke Then do you well I sweare by Saint tan, I sweare by mine honor ye shalbe deempt a man. Marques Atwight not me with fortune Dame, cease soone I do the pray, I must and will defend my selfe lest haply I decaye, Come of dispoyle thy selfe, cast of thy rich araye, From princlye state, to fathers house, all naked take thy waie.

Grissill Be not sorowfull at all, for this much pleaseth me, For by my deperture my Lord shall lyue in rest, His afflicted hart with carfull thoughts opprest, Shall fynde a salue of sauegard, to cuere his paine, Which doubtles shall make poore Grissill faine, Therfore deare Damsell thy lamentacion cease, Sith that my absence shall ioyes inummerable increase, The commons raige to mildnes shalbe diuerted, The nobillite shall shun stobernes, and become gentill harted, These consuminge Agonies which so much torment the minde, Of my singular sufferaigne, shalbe sure redresse to finde. Politicke Bones of a Taber with this fact shee is pleased, She careth not so hir Lords paines be eased, I haue not seene hir like, hir pacience dothe exceed, I saie no more but God send vs good speede, How many such be liuinge at this daye, Not one I coniecture for Grissils decaie, Therbe a nomber liuinge that Grissills haue to name, But yet very shrewishe by naturall dispocisyon, Ther maners assuredly far differ from the same, Let the maried soart here of make deffinicion, For the woman oft times to choller the good man will prouoke, Be well assured they must beare the greatist stroake. Grissell Take here these Robes and ornaments costly, Take here these things and Iuellus sumptuos, Take here the Ringe wher with we ioyned Matrimonie, Which daie was solemnysed and to all men ioyus, Bestow them where it shall please thee, my Lord most bountuous For all that euer I receiued of thee, I yeld thee againe, Beinge well contented in my former state to remaine, Yet moast worthie Lord, I do the humblye desire, One simple boune graunt me for a recompence, The thinge is of small value that I shall require, Which I beg on my kneese with honor and reuerence. Marquis Speake Grissill if thy Boune be symple I graunt thy request Arise incontinent let it be forth exprest. Grissell I thanke your honor for your beneuolence, Besechinge God to sheild thee from all in conuenience, On mee some time thy wife take remorse, Extend not against me the fulnes of rigors force, But plant pittie in thy brest be somewhat more fauorable, Consider it were great ignomye to thy estate honorable, To send me awaie naked to my fathers cottage, And to me wretched wight ten times more domaige, For all creatures shall be houlde the secrite corps of myne, Which somtimes were most amorus and pleasant to thy eine, Grant therfore this request to me wofull wight, Let pittie subdue and vanquishe rancorus spite, A symple Smocke to hide and couer my nakednes, Be it neuer so simple I besech your goodnes, Which I craue, to recompence my virginitie, The which I brought but cary not a waie with me, Let not me be made a laffinge stocke I praie the, But grant my request and take pittie on me. Marquis I grant thy desyre a Smocke thou shalt haue, And be conuaied to thy father like case. Grissell Truly no other thinge of the I will craue, I prayse God that in thy syght I haue founde grace, And syth this as my dowrye in aidge is ordained, Most louingly this scourge shalbe intertayned. Marquis Come Grissill with out lenger delaye, Thou shalt to thy father this present daye. Grissell Most willingly on your Lordship I will attend, Beyng desyrous to him for to wend. Exiunt. Politicke Ah syra this geare is trimly handled by St. tan, Howe saye you hath not Pollicie nowe playd the man, Shee shall home to her father shee, this is trim: But her sudden fall will trouble the harte of him, Fare ye well all, I will bee packing, Tush ther wants a man, where Pollicie is lackyng. Exit. Enter Rumor blowyng &amp; puffing. Rumor What thynge so euer is attempted, Or through the world frequented, From Rumor can not concealed bee, For I spread it through the whole countrie, And nowe haue I occasion my troumpe to bloe, And expreslye publishe poore Grissills woe, From the top of honor, the Marquis will her exile, For Fortune is fickle, although shee do smyle, Her chaunges vnstable, full of mutabylitie, Her wheele is full glyding, and of no sertaintie, Her freshe vissage, full soone chaungeth cheare, As nowe by Lady Grissill, doth playnly appeare, For shee is nowe throwne, from the top of prosperytie, And with old Iannickle, must suffer paynfull pouertie, Which fact swiftly through Salutia I will blowe, That all liuynge creatures his crueltie maye knowe. Enter Vulgus. Vulgus What Tumult through out Salutia is spred, A wonderfull Rumor among the commons is risen of late, A sudden report through out the towne is fled: Which forceth vs all, to bewayle Grissills state, Agaynst her causeles is by him kyndled much debate, For hee will exile from him, this Ladie of excelence: And constraine her nowe to lyue in needfull indigence, Which thing to thinke on, so pinche these our hartes, That for her sake wee are fayne teares to disstill, Shee often reliued our penurye and smartes, And therfore for her nowe, of force lament I will: It is euen so this chaunce hapneth most ill, Yunder she entreth alas and well awaye, Our harts ar made sorowfull to see this daie. Reason Oh Ladie we mourne and shed teares, this daye to beholde. Sobriete Our myndes are meastfull, pitious playntes wee vnfolde. Grissell Comfort your selues my Lordes, set heauines apart, For Pacience to suffer this, hath armed my hart: This Crosse is not contemned, but willingly imbrased, On God my trust, and confidence is placed, Therfore mourne no more, be neyther sorrowfull nor sad: But I reioyce in God, my hart is full glad. Vulgus Oh Grissill, Grissill, our hartes are full of heauines, Would God wee had wherwith, to couer thy nakednes: Then should wee ad remedie to this thy greef, Thou surelye at our handes, shouldste finde some releef: But woe be to this Marquis, which hath heaped thy payne, On his crueltie, wee haue iust cause to complayne: Woe be to this Marquis, ye curssed bee his dayes And this shalbe my prayer, nowe and alwayes. Exit Reason Lowe Maddame, we approche your fathers house at this season. Grissell Frendes in place I haue ben very geason, But nowe my fathers presence I shall continually behoulde, Whose company to mee, is more dearer then Gould. Ianickle What clamorous noyse is this, that I heare, That all be not well, I greatly feare, Ahlas) my Daughter Grissill, all naked I see, Which sight to discerne, much greeueth mee, Well I will haste to cloth her, with all conuenient speed, With this ragged coat, which I haue kept .xii. yeares in deed. Reason Behould father Iannickle, my Lord hath sent you a present. Sobrietie. For as shee came naked, so naked hee hath her sent. Ianickle Thanke my Lorde of his gentlenes and courtesie, Tell his honor my Daughter, is right welcome to me. Reason Wee are but the messingers, of his honorable minde, And nowe that our funcsions is ended, Wee commit thee to God, Oh Grissill moste kynde: To go homewarde, wee are intended. Grissell God in your goyng be your aid and guid, Commend me to your Lord with humble salutacion, Tell him I will praye for him daye time and tyde, I beseech God be his preseruacion. Sobrietie Grissill all that you haue said shall performed be, Father Iannickle our messaige is ended And God be with ye. Exiunt Ianickle Fare ye well, God be your defender, For your Lordes courtesie, thankes to you I render. Oh my chylde, and dearlye beloued, To pour forth foyson of teares, for thee I am moued: Oh harte breake in peeces, nowe sorowe is reuiued, To see thee of dignitie thus cleane depriued: Receaue thine owne Coate, and couer thy nakednes, Which I haue kept as treasure is, with dilligentnes: Euer doubting that this Marquis would displeased bee, With thy lowe estate, and indigent pouertie, What father could chuse, but on Fortune complayne, Which such hard Fate for thee doth ordayne, Oh froward Fortune, all together disceaueable, Full of Gerishe flatterye, all together varyable: The chaunges of thy hawtie wheele, to Luna I may compare, Who so trusteth thee hath often cause of care: From prosperytie to aduersitie the simple thou doste throe, Phie on thee Fortune, which art cause of my woe. Grissell Oh father bee ioyfull &amp; prayse God for my fall, For hee that gaue prosperitie, can send aduersitie: And at his prescript pleasure hee can swaidge the thrall, Of such as bee aflicted with needfull pouertie, Imbrace Pacience, let go rashe timeritie: Blame not Fortune for my ouerthroe, It was the will of God, that it should be so: And what creature liuing, can withstand his prouidence, This Crosse is to trye vs, as hee doth his elect, Therfore good father, arme your selfe with Pacience: Let not murmuracion your hart infect, But blesse mee Iehoua which his doth derect, Then will hee protect vs, from daunger and harme, Therfore with Pacience, our selues let vs arme. Ianickel Daughter I praise God as dutie doth me bynde, But yet thys fall of thine will no part from my minde, Oh how is my hart perplexed with woe, Not one but God my anguish doth knowe. Grissill Good father I beseche you set mourninge asyde, Cast your care on God who for vs will prouide, These handes shunne idlenes the Nurse of wickednes, My Rocke and Distafe, are instruments doubtles, With which as I haue in times past, so now in dead, Will I labor and toile our bodies to fead. Enter Pacience and Const ancye. Pacience I represent a vertue called Pacience, Uery meete and neadfull for such as suffer afflicsyon, I comfort the mind tossed with inconuenience, And in struckt them humblye to suffer punission, I teach them paciently to duer correcsion, So that in trouble I am a safe preseruasion, Meete for all those that byde vexacion. Constanci Like case I Constancie, am of like excelence I kepe the minde, vpright from the gulphes of dispaire, A sufficient preseruatiue am I, to the feebled consience I teach him on God to laye the yoake of all his care, Constancy causeth him to truth to repaire, So that who so hath vs, to much ease shall finde, For we are perfit props to the disquieted minde. Pacience I pacience expulse teares lachrimable, And ad to the sorowfull comfortable releef. Constanci And I constancye, to the tristfull am prophitable, I teach them amidst their trouble, to forget greef. Pacience To these two present, my selfe I iniugate. Constanci With pacience I constancy am alwaies confederate, And ther with them, lyke case I will resyde. Grissill Father be ioyfull let your sorowes slide, Behoulde these vertues which God hath vs sent, To imbrace pacyence with mee, good father be dilligent, This is a medisin for vs very comfortable. Ianickel Deare Daughter to your sayings I am agreable, Welcom pacience anescessary instrument, To them that in consyence do suffer torment. Grissell Laye holde on Constancie, which from Dispair will vs sheild. Ianakell To do as you do, in all things I yeild. Grissill So, now if you please let vs depart. Ianickell I graunt to go hence with all my hart. Pacience And I Pacience, on you will attend. Constanci In stormes tribulous constancye shall you defend. Exiunt Diligence From my Lord Marquis, euen now I am sent, Who euen now is iornied to Bullin Lagras, To featch whom his new spouse a Lady excelent, As beawtifull as euer the Greekishe Hellin was, Whom Paris the Troyean, hath wone in fight, And brought to Priams Court, by puissaunt might. But at this season accordinge to my Lords commaundiment, Which with humillitie I will bringe to perfecsion, As it becometh euery seruant to be dilligent, So as I am charged, I will giue Grissill here of intellecsion, Harke, me thinkes I here hyr voice delectable, Suerly to vertue, this Lady was tractable, How God be here, who resteth in this place. Grissell My poore Father and I this is a plaine case. Go once or twise about the Staige, let Grissill Singe some songe, and sit Spinninge. A songe for Grissill, when the Messinger commeth to hir. Grissell How greatly am I bounde to prayse My God that syts in Throne, Which hath asswaidged by prouidence, My anguishe and my mone. These vertues which with mee resyde all greefes haue banisht quit, Pacyence do ease my heauines and pensiue pained plight. Eeke Constancye from all anoye doth Grissill dayly sheld, So that I will be ioyfull still, and prayse to God aye yelde. Which in this greuous dolfull fall, suche mercie doth extend: As from the gulphes, of fond Dispaire, his creatures doth defend. The surgyng Sea, so troubulous, which tost mee to and froe: Whose watrye waues had suncke mee nyghe, In flooddes of deadlye woe, Alayed are, and I set free, from perrill and from payne: The Lord aboue, of his meare loue, no doubt hath made mee fayne. Finis. Dilligenc God saue the Grissill, and sheild the from care, My Lord Marquis, doth him to the commend, Dessiringe the home to his place, to repaire, For to wed a new Lady, hee doth purpose and in tende, But the rule of his house, is assined onlie to thee, All the officers of his house, shall to thee obedient bee, But aboue all thinges thou must make prouission, That his newe Spouse maye be lodged after the best wise: The order of all thinges, must bee assinde to thy discression, All thinges shall bee done, as you do deuise. Grissill With all my harte I will laye my Rocke aside, To pleasure his honor, in all that I can. Dilligenc Then in this place, let vs no lenger abyde, For I purpose to bee your waityng man. Exiunt. Marques Come on my Ladie deere, my Spouse and louing mate, The gods be blest which vnto mee, haue giuen such luckye Fate, As to inioye so faire a wife, whose feature doth excell, The Goulden Nimphes, and Muses nine, which on Pernasso dwell: These armes thy corps imbrace, on thee my ioye dependes, To pleasure thee my Ladie deare, thy husbands minde attends. Daughtr And eke to thee as dutie byndes, loues fruites I will imparte, Thou onlye my beloued mate, inioyest thy seruants harte: The fruites of frendly loue, to thee shall still be showne, My hart is thine, receaue the same, and take it as thine owne. Marques Possesse thou myne while death deuide, &amp; shred my File in twain, As long as life abides in corps, thine owne I will remaine: Reioyce ye Nobles all, deere sister ioyfull bee, For nowe my ioyes increased are, my Nuptialls you shall see, Countis O Brother mine gods giue you ioye, &amp; lengthen long your liues, Be present Himeneus thou, the vanquisher of striues: Subdue the Furies fell, whose vissages vgly blacke, Prognosticate that ioyfull ioyes, shall come to ruinous wracke. Brother Amen and Ioue, that rules, the earth and heauen aboue, The Plannits seauen and euery thyng, that orderly doth moue, Sende such increase of frendlines, that discords fruits may cease, And faithfull loue betwixt you twaine, may more &amp; more increase. Marquis I thanke you both for your good wills, now let vs haste awaye, In pompous wise to solemnise, our happye spousall daye. Grissill Now that I haue set all thinges in aredines, For the commyng of my Lord, I purpose to attend, Whose honnor I will receaue with willingnes: And the fruites of good will to him still ostend, Pacience is the Buckler wherwith I contend, And Constancie in combat, stayeth mee vpright, These so arme mee, that I can not be vanquisht in fight: Lo behould yonder thay begin in presence to appeare, Certes his spouse is wonderfull Amorous, With him lyke case, commeth a youngman wonderfull fayre, I will salute them with loquie courtuous: God saue you my Lorde, and send you his peace, Welcome fayre Ladye, God send thee prosperitie, God blesse the O my Lord, with Wisdomes increase, God preserue you all, right worthy Nobillitie. God graunt you to spende your time in tranquillitie: God streame on thy famous assembly, the spirit of grace, And graunt you long, on earth to ronne your race. Marquis Wee thanke thee Grissill for thy courtuous salutacion, And regreet thee agayne, with like gratulation, But tell one thinge, that I shall of thee require, Shewe frankly thy minde, I do thee homblie desyre: How saist thou? is not my spouse beautifull and faire, Bashe not I praye thee, but bouldly thy fancie declare. Grissell My Lorde touching your inquisission, Gladly ye shall heare poore Grissills diffinission: Her comly shape Nature hath framd aright, Each liuely lim appeares, full shining in my sight, Her vissaige white, with rednes mixt I deeme, Would moue euery creature, her beautie to esteeme, And to conclude, in my simple iudgement, Ther can not in the world bee a fayrer, this is euident: But harke my Lord, what I saye to thee agayne, Take heed thou pricke her not, with the Needles of disdayne: As thou hast done the other, for shee hath bin brought vp dayntelie, And peraduenture, can not take the matter so pacientlie. Marquis Oh Grissill, thy Uertues I must commend, Euen thou onely, deseruest perpetuall prayse: What tounge sufficiently, can thy laude ostend, I haue not seene thy lyke in all my dayes, For faithfull loue, thou doest far excead, Dido, Penellope, or anie such in dead: Thou onely art my Spouse, and beloued mate, Thee onely I fancye, all other Spousalls I hate: And this Uirgin which thou deemest, my Spouse shall bee, Is thy Daughter and mine, this is the veritie, And this young man, which thou seeist in sight, Is thy sonne and mine, my loue and Ladie bright: They were not slayne, but Nourished tenderlye, With my sister, the Countis of Pango verelye: Therfore be ioyfull, set sorrowes asyde, Thou art my loue, my Ladie, and Bryde: And this whiche I haue done, I promise thee I, Was done for this cause, thy Pacience to trye. Grissell My Children, oh moste fortunate daye, Blessed be God, that kept you from decaye: Fall downe. Ah I thought the sworde, had ended your race, But nowe I prayse God, I vewe your comlye face. Daughtr Ah my sweet mother, did thou suffer such payne, For mee thy Childe, great is thy Pacience, God graunt I maye kindly, reward thee agayne, With the perfecte fruictes, of Clildlie obedience. Sonne Ah deare mother, in whose wombe I was nourished, And thearin by deuine essence, fortie weekes cherished, Hast thou suffred for mee, such anguishing tribulacion, God graunt I may requite the, with condinge venerasion. Countis Oh Syster great cause haue you ioyfull to bee. Grissill Ah it delighteth me much, my Children to see, My ioyes so farre excead and be innumerable, That no wight liuinge, to shoe them is able, I can not vtter my minde teares so abounde, Wherfore at this instant, let vs depert this place. Reason We are glad that Grissill such fauor hath founde. Sobrietie Truly these tydynges, the commons will solace. Marques Come on Nobillitie, let vs hence wend. All On your honor willinglie we will attend. Exiunt. Ianickell Much musinge in minde, wheare my Grissill is thus longe, My waueringe minde is tossed, with thoughts to and froe, I pray God this Marques, haue done hir no wronge, Nor sought meanes further, to trouble me wt greefe and woe, For then shall ould Ianickle, his life soone for goe, Hir domadge is mine, hir harme as mine I take, Till such time as I see hir, my sorowes can not slake, Good lucke I trust, for the Marquis entreth this place, I will hast to him with all festinacyon, And rest me behinde him, alittill space, Peraduenture I shall heare newes, by his communicasion. Marquis What saie you my Lords, doth not Grissill excell. Reason From all spoused Dames she beareth the Bell, I haue not seene hir like since the time of my creasion, Worthely deserueth shee, praise and laudacyon. Sobriete Grissill your spouse dothe merrit commendasion, Hir Fame is blowne through euery nacion, All creatuers liuinge may speake of hir praise, I neuer knew hir like in all my life daies. Marquis Then this one thinge I praie you tell me, Is it not conuenient, that after me hir Children raine, And inioye ouer Salutia, rule and dignitie, Here in I desire you shoe your iudgmentes plaine. Reason. Right honorable Lord a voyding daingers, and doubts scrupelous I franckly and freely, make protestacyon, That hir condiscion, beinge as they be most vertuous Shall cause hir Children to be had in estimacion, And God willinge as our superiours, they shall rule this nacion, For sith they be the fruts, which from your loynes did procead, Of force they shall posses, your inheritance in dead. Sobrietie. And I plight my faith therto, for perfourmaunce of the same, Els God confound me with confusion and shame. Marquis I giue you most humble thankes for your good will, In that ye are bent to mine, after me a legeaunce to fulfill, Come on I besech ye and walke with me a littill waye. Both We are readie prest, your honor to obaie. Ianickell These comfortable tidinges, comfort my aiged hart, Be merry now Ianickel let all sorowes departe, Blessed be God the giuer of all consolacion, Which hath stirred this Marquis on Grissill to take compassion. Marques God speede good father, how is it with thee, Thinke not but thou art highly beloued of mee, Oh thy curtuosie in my syght hath found grace, Not as a strainger, but as my father I the imbrace, Put of these garments for thee most vnfittie, For thou shalt be honored through out this Cittie, Cloth thy selfe with these Ornaments with out lenger delaie, Helpe my Nobilitie, my father to araye, Shall not I loue thee, and yeld the venerasion, Which to my spoused mate extendest compassion, To harbor hir in neade you doubtles were dilligent, Therfore to prefer thee to honor, I iudge it conuenient, With in my roufe thou shalt be placed, Let ioyes a bound, and sorowes be deffaced. Ianickell Oh honorable Lord, Ioue reward this kindnes, Which to me poore Ianickle, you presently ostend, God in crease the with wisdom, I besech his goodnes, And from all daingers thy person defend, Which the fullnes of frendship dost frendly extend, To me croked wight, and my Daughter thy wife, I beinge half dead, you haue reuiued my life. Marquis O Father repeat not my vnkindnes I pray the, Which afflicted thy Child, with the scourge of aduersitie, But learne now in thine ould daies ioyfull to be, And posses with vs Gods gift prosperitie, Come on to our Mansyon, let vs all together repaire. All To waight on your honor we dilligent are. Exiunt. Grissell Come on my deare Syster whose kindnes to recompence, Poore Grissell is vnable, which keptst from inconuenience, My Children, fostringe them as thine owne God graunt my good will to the may be showne. Countis Syster that which I did, proceaded from my hart, It suffizeth me that thankes to me ye do imparte. Grissill Els might I be counted of all creatures most vnkinde, Uerely your kindnes, shall neuer out of my minde, Oh my Children, your Mothers hart is made faine, Where as with Cleopatra, I had cause to complaine, Now reieckt I sorowe, and mourning cheare And constrained am to ioye, to see you liuinge heare. Daughtr Oh my beloued Mother, great was the tribulacion, Which your Motherly hart for vs did indure. Sonne But now our presence, ten times more consolacion, To you I hope shall dailye procure. Grissell Truth, but yet one thinge doubtles in creaseth my sorow, And will force me to shed teares, euen and morowe, Oh my deare Father thy absence I be waile, To see thee suffer indigente greef, doth my hart assaile Would God with in our roufe, thou mightest thy place in ioye Then doubtles weare eased my greef and anoie, Let me see oh hart thy dolors abrogate, Let ioye abound thy former solace reuocate, Beholde thy husband and thy Fathers aidged face, Who both together frendly do entder this place, His rags are chainged to Sylkes I perfytly see, Now know I asuredly my Lord doth fauor mee. Marques Come on good Father, reioyce and be mearie, With pensyue state I iudge you be wearye, Behould thy Daughter my Ladie and wife, With whom God willinge, I will end this life, Behoulde my two Children reuiue thy selfe againe, Imbrace gladnes, oblight thy former payne. Ianickle God be blessed, which from so great aduersitie, Hath elleuated vs to great prosperitie, Ah sweete Children God blesse you, and send you his grace, My hart doth leape to behoulde your face, Now haue I seene that, which I longe to see desyred haue, Now doth my hoarie head couit the graue, Now doth death delaie time and spare his dart, And will not sonder, ould Ianickells hart. Grissell Good father couit not death, your race is not runne, The destinies more lenger, your thread haue sponne. Sonne Oh Grandfather prayse God, and wishe not your death. Daughtr Nay rather desire him, to lengthen your Breath. Marques Come on now let vs to our place with ioyfullnes, All We all will attend on you with willyngnes. Exiunt. The last speaker. Postemus Actor Here to conclude right gentell audience, At this season, wee purpose and intend Besechinge you all, with vs to haue pacyence, For loath would we be, the simplest here to offend, In our auctors behalfe to you we did commend, This historie, wherin we haue bin bould to shoe What virtues in Grissell, that Ladie did floe: Although rude our doinges, and auctors metor bee, Yet seeme not vs, nor him to deface, We submit our selues, vnto your iudgmentes wee And thus we knit vp, with support of your grace. Desiringe your praiers with vs in this case, In which our Noble Queene Elesabeth, to you we commend, Whom God in the Bowels of his mercy do defend, Blesse hir O Father, and graunt hir Nestors dayes, Sheild hir with the wings of his mercie and grace, That as shee hath begon to set forward thy praise, So strengthe hir Lord, to aduance thine honor in euery place, Hyr fooes and enemies vtterlye deface, Whether they be forren or ciuill, let their confusion be seene Lord blisse thou our lande, and preserue our Royall Queene. The Lords of the Counsell, Lord Gouerne aryght, That they may be mindfull of the common weale, Shadowe and defend them, with thy glorious spright, That vnto thy truth they may beare loue and zeale, Unto them (O God) the spright of knowledge reueale, That synne may be extirped and rooted out quight, And we vnto truth, and virtue, fyx our delight.
