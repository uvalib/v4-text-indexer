      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. —The Sky—the stage covered with clouds—and the starry firmament in the background.—Rising from the clouds in the foreground are seen a milestone, on which is written “To Jupiter—60,000 leagues,” and a finger-post, pointing in one direction “to Orion,” in the other “to the Milky Way;” a little further back a light kind of building, from which projects a sign-board, with the words, “The Halfway House; good accommodation for Sprite and Geni.” Peris, Spirits, &amp;c., grouped among the clouds. CHORUS OF SPIRITS. Tune—“Carnival de Venise” Through starlit skies, when day has set, We spirits, gay and free (To use coarse language), loose are let, To roam upon the spree, When nightingales their notes begin To warble on the spray, And larks the sons of men are seen Along the streets to play. And We won't go home till morning, We won't go home till morning; We won't go home till morning, Till daylight doth appear. [Chorus repeated, becoming gradually fainter, while the Spirits disappear. Enter Maimoune and Filma in a car, drawn by doves, S. E. L. Mai. Holloa there, house! now, stupid, look alive; My doves are rather heated by their drive, And want attending to—now, then, I say! Ski. (within.) Coming. Mai. Oh! coming—so's the break of day. [Gets out of car. Enter Skilopht, hurriedly, R. Oh! here you are! Is this, sir, your civility, Detaining Peris of respectability Out here, at your abominable door, Bawling and shouting till their throats are sore? There's not a house, 'twixt this and Georgium Sidus, But with more prompt attendance would provide us. Ski. Madam, I'm really very sorry. Mai. Stuff! I warrant you'd be sorry though, enough, Should you find out you'd lost the patronage Of every member of the Peri-age. Take care; your house, despite its situation, Has not a very first-rate reputation; Afrites, hobgoblins, here a refuge find, And Djinns of the most questionable kind. Look to your licence! [Skilopht is about to speak. Mai. Come, no words I need; Put up my drag, and give the doves a feed. [Skilopht bows, and is leading the car in. Mind that off-leader's wing, it's got a scar From a slight singe against a shooting star; Then a sky parlour for us see prepared. Ski. I'll have our best star-chamber nicely aired. [Exit, leading in car, R. Fil. The drive has done you good? Mai. A little, dear; It would be odd if one felt low, up here; But ah! I find that drive, howe'er I may, I can't completely drive dull care away. Fil. What is it you in sorrow doth so steep? Tell me, your friend. Mai. Can you a secret keep? Fil. Of course I can—you ought to be aware of it. Mai. Then here's one—I'm in love—now mind, take care of it. Fil. In love? Mai. Why, yes, my bosom's had a smarter From Venus's sharp son, or rather darter. Fil. Who is the happy spirit? Mai. Why, my dear, My choice is slightly infra dig., I fear. Fil. How? sure you haven't let a vulgar Djinn Or low-bred Afrite your affections win? Mai. It isn't that (aside); I wish I had a fan To hide my blushes; it's, in fact, a man! Fil. (horror-struck.) A man! good gracious! do I hear aright? Mai. You do. Fil. (curtseying very coldly.) Then, Madam, I must say, good night! Mai. Where would you go? Fil. I'd rather not be seen With any one who could herself bemean So shockingly. Mai. Oh! this my bosom wrings; Stay, take my carriage. Fil. Thank you, I have wings. [Curtsies distantly, and sinks, so as to give an appearance that she is flying downwards. Mai. My friend has cut her stick, and my connexion, And so I shall be cut in each direction; I shall be shunn'd by all the fairy race; But what's their countenance to his sweet face? For his sake I could almost change my station, Procure an act of naturalization, And be a mortal—I can't live without him: Stay, by-the-bye, I'll sing a song about him. SONG. Tune—“Jenny Jones.” His name's Camaralzaman—charms most delectable Lurk in his glances, his dimples, and smiles, His father and mother are highly respectable, Good truth, he's crown prince of the Khaledan Isles. And indeed of all mortals, so lovely and beautiful, That same young gentleman ranks far above, For indeed in my heart I do love that Camaralzaman, That sweetest of princes, good truth, I do love. He's just had a row with his cross-grain'd old father, Who wants him to wed some illustrious lass, But he has to wedlock a rooted objection, And into its bondage refuses to pass. So he's locked in his room till his mind he shall alter, Which me to deep sorrow and pity does move, For indeed in my heart I do love that Camaralzaman, That sweetest of princes, in truth, I do love. But, judging by the pricking of my thumbs, Something extremely wicked this way comes. [Looking off. What form is that? Hah! by this distant sight of it, It seems a Djinn, come out to make a night of it. Dan. (L. outside.) Lur-li-e-ty! Mai. It is a Djinn—dear, dear! When will the sky of nuisances be clear? It's most annoying, and by no means right, That decent spirits can't fly out at night, But they with such-like folks must come in contact; Now, hang me! as a justice if I won't act; I'll take the rascal up, upon suspicion, And only let him go on one condition, That of himself a good account he'll render. [Looking off. You precious scamp! I'll bring you to a tender. [Withdraws. Enter Danasch, flying. SONG. Tune—“Mrs. Johnson.” Oh, I have had a charming ride, The night could not more sweetly glide With gents, the Coal Hole's walls inside, Or at the Doctor Johnson. A moonlight flit I do enjy, [Stopping, as if struck by a sudden idea. That's wrong pronounc'd though, by-the-bye, For Walker spells it j-o-y, And so does Doctor Johnson. No four-in-hand, or dog-cart rare, Can with my “patent fly” compare, Though saying so, I'm well aware, Would anger Doctor Johnson. For that great man was wont to cry, Who'd make a pun would fake a cly! I don't think so myself—not I— But so says Doctor Johnson. Let's see what sort of sport now have I had; Um! taken altogether, not so bad; In the first place, a fog to earth I sent, Which caused a charming Railway Accident— And which, unless the air soon gets a cleanser, Is safe to propagate the Influenza; Then, knowing well what most men's feelings hurts, I tore the buttons from no end of shirts; I'm rather proud of that last-named expedient— [Maimoune comes forward, R. And then—Hilloa! madam, your most obedient. Mai. Stand and deliver! Dan. What? Mai. Your name. Dan. Well, really, Sky-high-way robbery this is, most clearly. Who steals my purse steals trash—but 'tis a shame If any filches from me my good name. Mai. No sauce, sir; keep your proper spirit level. Dan. (aside.) She's my superior, I'd best be civil; My name you wanted, was it, ma'am? oh yes, I'll give it with a taste of my address. SONG. Tune—“My Name, it is Sam Hall.” My name Danasch they call, Lady sweet— My name Danasch they call, Lady sweet— My name Danasch they call, I'm a Djinn of power, but small, And I rambles at nightfall Through the skies. Mai. (shaking her head.) That name for your good conduct pleads but vainly; But, now I see your ugly face more plainly, I recognise it. What, sir, were you doing? What kind of small-beer mischief were you brewing One night—about the middle of last week— When, like an atmospheric airy-sneak, I saw you from a Chinese palace crawl? Dan. Admiring Nature's beauties, that was all. [Maimoune laughs. Well, and what of it? I suppose I may? Mai. Oh! by all means—what sort of beauty, pray? Dan. A female one; such shoulders, such a face! I'm half in love—it's very near a case. Mai. And pray who thus inflames your tender bosom? Dan. “Lend me your ears;” or—stay, you'll want to use 'em. DUET. Tune—“Barclay and Perkins's Drayman.” Dan. In Pekin town does now reside A princess, who doesn't much lack men, Her lily-white hand she's long denied To lots of first-rate or “crack” men. At wedlock's bonds she vows she'll strike, Declaring she'll never obey man— Which vexes her Pa. Mai. How remarkably like The case of my Camaral-za-man! Dan. They've locked her up—but it's all in vain, She still is determined to sack man, Though suitors approach her again and again, She turns up her nose at each Jack man; But the brightest beauty earth has got, By her would appear a tame 'un— Mai. Now, there you're wrong, for I'm sure she cannot Compare with my Camaral-za-man. Dan. Pray, who's your friend? Mai. One whose bright beauty's ray Would quite eclipse your bit of China clay. Dan. Gammon! Mai. Low wretch! expressions such as that! Dan. I say it's gammon—cut exceeding fat— For many insults I've a strong digestion, But I can't have my taste call'd into question. Mai. The public journalists are right in stating The lower orders' tastes want elevating. That youth the greatest beauty ever known is. Dan. I'll bet you six to one, in flying ponies— Mai. (aside.) Now, really, I have half a mind to take him; I will—if but a better judge to make him— Done! here's my hand, though it's a degradation: [They shake hands. Of rival lines, here's an amalgamation. Dan. But you must find the proof! Mai. I will—a valid 'un— Fly with your princess to the isles of Khaledan I'll meet you there, from now, in half-an-hour, In the top chambers of the eastern tower Of the Imperial Palace. Dan. I'll be there: Three thousand miles, though, to convey a fare, In half an-hour, one must have to fly Like electricity. Pooh! that's gone by; At least, I think so, if I've heard aright of it; Mai. At any rate, it seems they're making light of it! DUET. Tune—“Fly not yet.” Mai. Fly, you've yet but half-an-hour To reach your boasted beauty's bower, And from her home, by magic might, No matter where she spends the night— To make her shoot the moon. Dan. 'Tis but to vindicate my taste, That so much time and toil I'll waste; Oh! soon you'll find, her beauty glowing, Will put a stop to all your crowing— Mai. Don't stay—don't stay. Both. The friend, of whom you seem so vain, I'm quite convinced is rather plain; You'll have to change your tune. [Exeunt different ways. Scene II. —Camaralzaman's Sitting-room, an Eastern apartment of great splendour, with the various appurtenances of a modern fast man's pursuits strewed about; foils, boxing-gloves, portraits of ballet-dancers, race-horses, statuettes, &amp;c.—The moonlight seen through an opening at the back, a lamp burning. —Camaralzaman enters, R.; reclines lazily on a couch. Cam. 'Tis now the very witching time of night, Which, were I free, would bring with it delight; Now could I drink hot grog, hear comic songs, Or join the gay Casino's gladsome throngs, Or drain, 'midst buzzing sounds of mirth and chaff, The foaming stout, or genial half-and-half; But here a prisoner condemned to stop, I can indulge in neither malt nor “hop.” Oh, cruel Pa'! to place me in this state, Because I would avoid your own sad fate. Dear mother, though a model of a wife, Gave me a slight distaste for married life. [Shudders. Better be thus than free, and have to stand “An eye like Ma's, to threaten and command.” SONG. Tune—“The Pope he leads,” &amp;c. The Pope he leads a happy life Because he hasn't got a wife, And one to take he's not so flat, He knows a trick worth two of that. No shrill abuse his ear affrights For stopping out too late at nights; No curtain lectures damp his hopes; A happy lot must be the Pope's. Though, poor old Pope! if all we hear be true, There's little need, just now, to envy you. What shall I do to pass the time away? I'd go to bed, but I've been there all day. Oh! here's last Tuesday's Khaledan Gazette, I've only read it fifteen times, as yet. [Takes up paper, and lolls on the couch, commences reading. Holloa! I feel a sudden wish for dozing, My eyelids agitate for early closing! [Drowsily. I s'pose this parliamentary debate Acts as an instantaneous opiate. It's very odd—a strange—queer—drowsy—feeling, A sort of still—so—gently—o'er—me—stealing. [Music—“Oh! slumber, my darling,” very slowly. He sleeps. Enter Maimoune, through wall, R. Mai. What a convenience is this free admission We fairies have, to ev'ry exhibition! Where'er we please, uncharg'd, we find our way to; Even cathedrals, they can't make us pay to. (Looking at Camaralzaman.) I've sent him off. What smiles his slumbers sweeten! And there's a brow—it couldn't be brow-beaten. With such a love as that, who could be harsh? I wonder how he'd look with a moustache— He's got none yet; though, thanks to sorrow's growth, He feels a little down about the mouth. Talking of mouths, I've of a custom heard Called, let me see—ah! kissing—that's the word— [Approaching Camaralzaman. I'm told it's wrong! but where can be the crime? [She is just about to kiss him, when Danasch appears, L. suddenly through the wall opposite, and coughs. Arn't you a little bit before your time? [Slightly disconcerted. And where's the Princess? why have you not brought her? Dan. (with dignity.) Would you degrade me, ma'am, from Djinn to Porter? She's coming; I've consigned her to the cares Of a concern in which I hold some shares— An underground conveyance company— I've told them the address, she's here, you see! [El Bogi rises, C., with Badoura in his arms asleep, and veiled. Thanks, my brave Asia miner;—place her there. [El Bogi carries Badoura to the couch, where Camaralzaman is sitting. Steady, she's “China—right side up, with care;” Next time we meet we'll settle for the fare. [El Bogi bows and disappears through trap, R. Mai. So, that's your Chinese Exhibition, is it? Dan. Yes—so “step forward,” ma'am, it's worth a visit; Just going to begin. [Removes Badoura's veil. Mai. Um! not amiss; But look upon this picture, and on this. Dan. (with the air of a connoisseur.) Well! not so bad; the outline pretty bold, The flesh tints good, the shadows rather cold. Too much foreshort'ning, p'r'aps, about the nose, And that left elbow seems to want repose— There's merit in it, that I freely own, [Camaralzaman snores suddenly. But, altogether, I don't like the tone. In fact, both pictures' beauties fairly weighed, I must say mine throws yours into the shade. Mai. If so, its case is very much the same As certain Vernon pictures I could name; But I deny it. Now, with fairness view it— Your picture beat that?—'tis n't framed to do it. Dan. Why, then, the wager's drawn, of course. Yet, stay; To settle it, I've thought upon a way: To wake 'em up in turns now, I propose, And let that one which for the other shows Most admiration, lose. D'ye like the notion? Mai. I don't object to seconding the motion. Dan. Well, then, here goes to put the plan in force; Mind, we're invisible, you know. Mai. Of course. [Danasch sings to Badoura. Tune—“The Swiss Boy.” Come, arouse thee, arouse thee! A very nice boy To receive your opinion doth stay; But rapturous terms in his praise please don't use, Or, a bet I'm engaged in, you'll cause me to lose. Then arouse thee, arouse thee! But please don't employ Too much praise, or the stakes I must pay. [Badoura wakes, and looks round her, amazed. Bad. What place is this? my eyes! (rubbing them) am I awake? I must be; no—I'm not—it must be a mistake. [Seeing Camaralzaman, screams slightly. Heavens! what's that? it can't be—yes, it can— I really do believe it is a man,— [Rises, advances, goes angrily up to him, then runs back. One of that sex I've sworn to crush and wreck, too; [Looks at his face, and starts. Really, I never! and I don't expect to— A dreadful weakness seizes me; I'm poorly— Yes—and it's something very serious, surely. All my strong notions upon Woman's Mission Seem leaving me. I'm in a sad condition; My strength, my will, my resolution, fails me. [Running up to Camaralzaman, and shaking him. Here, sir, get up, and let me know what ails me. [Shakes him. Why, he won't wake; unmov'd he keeps his station. Now, in this very trying situation, With every sort of doubt my bosom wringing, What can be so appropriate as singing? SONG. Tune—“The Jolly Young Waterman.” I really ne'er saw so delightful a sort of man, All my political notions so high, His charms have upset with uncommon celerity, Winning my heart and delighting my eye. If he'd wake and propose, without feeling much sorrow, I'd wed him to-night, before to-morrow; But for loving or liking he don't seem to care, Or he wouldn't lie snoozing and slumbering there. Dan. She's said enough—perchance, a little more; Oblige me, ma'am, by sleeping as before. [Makes mesmeric passes before Badoura's face. She drops asleep beside Camaralzaman. Mai. Now, own your China ornament outdone, By spicy Araby's most spicy son; When that son rises, no admiring tones Like hers you'll hear. [Taps Camaralzaman, playfully, with her wand. Get up, a lazy-bones! SONG. Tune—“Isabelle.” Wake, dearest, wake! by me invited, You'll see what you will see; But, by the spectacle highly delighted, I really don't think you will be. Here's a belle, here's a belle, here's a belle, That we want you to get up and gaze on; Please to tell, please to tell, please to tell, If you think her worth heaping much praise on. Tumble up. Cam. (starting up.) Give me another chop! cut off the fat Look sharp, there, waiter. Soft! what am I at? Another dream of bliss like that I'll seek. [Yawns; and, in doing so, he touches Badoura's cheek with his hand; he looks up, astonished. What do I touch? now, if that is n't cheek? Am I awake? a woman in this place! [Rubs his eyes. Yet, stay, just now I slapped her in the face, And, though with rage against the sex I swell, I ought to kiss the place to make it well. [Kisses her. I think the blow I gave was rather rough, And one kiss, p'r'aps, will scarcely be enough: I'll try some more. [Kisses her again. Now, wake; I wish you would Get up, and tell me if it's done you good. [Shakes her. That shaking on her no impression makes, [Shakes her again. And I can't wake her in a brace of shakes. Miss What's-your-name, come, please wake up, do try; She can't wake; she's bewitched, and— [Stopping a little, and looking at her. So am I. My anti-marriage vows away I fling, And stand, henceforth, a champion of the ring. I would propose, did not her silence stop one, And let this sudden visit prove a “pop” one. SONG. Tune—“Young Agnes,” (Fra Diavolo.) Young lady, beauteous flower, Sweet as blooming May, Shake off sleep's drowsy power, And hear me say my say: I'm rich, and I'm well to do, I'm handsome, young, and tall, I want to propose to you, If you'll but wake, that's all. So, wake, my fairest flower, Dost thou not hear Love's call? [Sitting by Badoura, and taking her hand. Do, please, awake! what power thus silent keeps her? Mai. (aside.) I'm getting very angry. Go to sleep, sir. [Hits Camaralzaman a sharp blow on the head, with her wand. He drops off asleep, immediately. Dan. (aside.) The Peri colours up like a geranium, Queer thoughts are brooding in her Peri-cranium. Mai. Now, but that I'm a spirit, I should say, That I was going to cry or faint away; And were such things worn by the Peri race, I'd beg of somebody to cut my lace. But this is weak! how could I ever waste A thought on one so destitute of taste? SONG. Tune—“Carry me back to Ole Varginny.” [Mai.] Oh! if a grain of taste he had, He'd never choose her for a wife; I never felt anything like so mad In all my Peri life; She's coarse, she's old, she squints, she's skinny, But let me see her no more! (To Danasch.) Oh! carry her back, you stupid ninny, Away to China's shore. Chorus. [Together.] Mai. Oh! carry her back, you stupid ninny, And let me see her no more. Dan. I'll carry her back; but stupid ninny I won't be called any more. [At the conclusion of the Chorus, Maimoune strikes her hand fiercely against the wall, and disappears through it “in a huff.” [Dan.] A stuck-up minx! as arrogant as crusty, Treating me here like dirt—I'm none so dusty— Like a mere servant, ordering me about; Egad! I'll serve her—that is, serve her out. But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air, [Cock crows. Yes, and the “early bird,” I do declare, Already on the ground begins to scrub, For picking up the worm which forms his grub; I must be off now, by your leave, my dear— [Takes Badoura on his arm. To quote an ancient saw, “you don't lodge here.” [Sinks with her. Scene III. —China.—Gardens of the Imperial Palace. Chinese music.—Enter a Procession of Guards, Mandarins, &amp;c. They form a group on one side; then enter the Emperor. Man. Long live the Emperor! Emp. Silence, villains! stow it! We'll not live long, unless we like—you know it. 'Tis not for your plebeian throats to give Orders to us how long you'd have us live. [They all prostrate themselves before him. Sons of burnt fathers! what means that position? How dare you tumble down without permission? [They rise abruptly, and stand bolt upright, in a line. Now, by my pigtail! by my father's nails! By the imperial dragon's sacred scales! My mind's so tossed about, so hurried, flurried, Bothered, perplexed, annoyed, insulted, worried, That soon I feel, with passion and disgust, Within my bosom there will be a bust— One universal smash my senses scatter— [Mildly to audience. Yet, stay, I'd best first tell you what's the matter. SONG. Tune—“Lord Lovel.” [Emp.] Lord love ye, now list, while my tale I relate, And to my sad story give heed, 'Tis by my own daughter I'm brought to this state, And I'm very unhappy indeed! Chorus. Deed—deed, He's very unhappy in-deed! [Emp.] 'Tother day, “'tis my wish you should marry,” I said; “Indeed though I won't,” says she— And of all the young princes I've wished her to wed, Not one will my lady fan-cy. Chorus. Cy—cy, Not one will his lady fan-cy. [Emp.] For she's vowed, and she's vowed, and she's vowed, and she's vowed, And she's vowed, and she's vowed ev'ry day, That she never will marry—her spirit so proud, No husband will ever obey. Chorus. Bey—bey, No husband will ever o-bey. [Emp.] But no longer I'll beg; I've been gentle enough, I'll insist on her marriage to-morrow; I'll be savage, despotic, ferocious, and gruff, Though to be so 'twill plunge me in sorrow. Chorus. Orrow—orrow, To be so will plunge him in sor-row. [Trumpet. Enter an Usher, introducing Jin Sling. Ush. His Highness Prince Jin Sling, Prince of Japan, Heir to the Isles of— Jap. (entering, and pushing him backwards.) That'll do, my man. Emp. How fares our guest this morning? Jap. Oh! tol-ol-ish. Emp. (aside.) Japan is not remarkable for polish. Jap. But, now to business: come, what says your daughter To the fine eloquence with which I've sought her? Is she resolved still to oppose her fate, sir, And miss the splendid match that here awaits her? Emp. Great prince! altho' I grieve to find it so, Emphatically speaking, it's no go! I pressed your suit—she swore she'd ne'er espouse— She'd not be saddled with the bridal vows; The sex's dignity forbad such thraldom To men—inferior beings, as she called 'em— Jap. Infatuated female! did you tell her That I'm considered a good-looking fellow; That I have talent, courage, name, and rank, Fame in the field, and money in the Bank? Emp. It's no use telling her such things as these, Such pleas don't suit her, and such suits don't please; The way she treated me, sure, in a daughter was Conduct which, to a father, didn't ought to was; She's thrown off all the show of love she shammed first, And, rather than obey, she'll see me— [Crash. Loud noise of slamming doors, &amp;c. [Badoura rushes in through door, L. her hair hanging loose down her back. Women, &amp;c., following. Duet.—(“Lucia di Lammermoor.”) Recitative. Bad. Oh, my father! my best friend, oh! Some pity show, pray, Unto poor me, oh! Or in two my heart you'll rend, oh! So my husband Now let me see, oh! [Kneels to Emperor. Emp. How, your husband? you surely have been dreaming, I suppose, oh? Bad. Nay; I've seen him. Emp. Gammon! Bad. 'Tis you know so; I saw him but last night. Emp. Come, come, let's have no nonsense. [Crosses to L. Bad. I say last night, sir. Emp. Come, come, no nonsense. Bad. What? Emp. No nonsense! Aria. Emp. If you teaze me, you'll repent, oh! You must be mad for to talk so to me, oh! Cease, or I my wrath give vent to, Which will teach ye civil to be; Mad you are. A commission shall attend, oh! De Lunatico Inquirendo. Bad. You may rave and rant to me, oh! Say I am mad, and exhaust all your threats, oh! Still I fear no ill to see, oh! But for that sweet youth my heart still frets. Give him to me, or mind what you are arter, For you in me will find you've caught a Tartar! [Bad. and Emp. together.] Bad. Yes, you'll find you've caught a Tartar, Caught a Tartar, sir, in me! Emp. Oh, my darter! oh, my darter! You're as mad as mad can be! [... together.] Emp. She's mad! Bad. I'm not! Emp. What can you know about it? We've said you're mad, and so how dare you doubt it? Bad. Nay, best of parents—once more glad my sight With that fair form that I beheld last night. Jap. Sweet maid, dismiss that mockery unreal, Cut not your true beau for that beau ideal. Emp. 'Tis clear as mud! she's mad; 'tis as I said, [Firmly Girl, there stands he whom I command you wed; My words are law, mind! Bad. Then your law's a spooney 'un— A poor law, that would drive me to that Union. Emp. Rash girl! no more; was ever heard such daring? This madness must be cured; 'tis past all bearing. Away, slaves! scour the country till ye find A doctor, who'll restore her to her mind; She shall be cured! [Exeunt Mandarins, R., hastily. (To Badoura.) How dare you lose your senses? Get well at once, or take the consequences. [Exeunt tragically, followed by Usher and Guards. Jap. (Kneeling to Badoura, and holding her dress.) Oh! sweetest princess, whose bright charms unfold Such wondrous beauties, at thy feet behold A prince of ancient line and noble blood, In his best trowsers, kneeling in the mud. Bad. I may be handsome, but I'll now be plain, So, I'll not have you, sir—you kneel in vain. Jap. Can one so fair speak thus to her adorer? Your form a Venus, but your words a Floorer; Think better of it—no harsh lord I'd be, A model husband you should find in me; I'd ask no latch-key, ne'er from home would stray, Would eat cold mutton on a washing-day. Bad. No more, sir—leave me: 'tis in vain to sue Where no effects can possibly accrue. Jap. Nay, but my suit—your father does abet it. Bad. “Methinks, I see my father” going to get it. DUET. Tune—“My pretty Page.” Bad. A pretty rage, no doubt, papa Is in; but threats quite useless are. Jap. Oh, fairest lady, hear me still, I'll love you true, indeed I will. Bad. Once more, I say, get out again, You do not suit me now, that's plain. Jap. My loving wife I'm sure you'll be; I know you can't say no to me. Bad. Leave me, I pray— Jap. Don't send me away, You'll repent, if you do; For you love me as well As I love you. Bad. The deuce I do! Jap. Indeed you do Bad. What, I? Jap. Yes, you. Bad. I? Jap. You. Bad. Not I—get away. Jap. Not I—here I'll stay. [Exeunt, L. Scene IV. —A gloomy, demoniac-looking Cave. Danasch discovered at a table formed of rocks, with pen, ink, and paper before him. Several Geni seated round and grouped in various attitudes. All. Hear! hear! hear! Dan. Now, gentlemen, before we cut it short, Attention, if you please, to my report. All. Hear! hear! Dan. (reads.) Resolved,—That Peris are a stuck-up set, And a let down or two deserve to get. All. Hear! hear! hear! Dan. Resolved,—That one of them—by name Maimoune— Is, in this meeting's estimation, “spooney,” Towards a prince, who does her heart possess, And also jealous of a young princess. All. Hear! hear! hear! Dan. Resolved,—That, as the said princess and prince Met with each other once, but never since, And, unless help'd by magic power, it's plain There's little chance they'll ever meet again— This meeting shall provide the help requir'd, By which said meeting gains its ends desired,— Namely, to give said Peri great vexation, And of her monkey cause the elevation. All. Hear! hear! Dan. Resolved,—That Danasch be at once deputed To see this meeting's wishes executed. All. Hear! hear! hear! [Great applause. Danasch sits down. (A Djinn rises.) Dji. Before you think of moving, suffer me to— I beg to move—what you must all agree to— A vote of thanks to our esteem'd friend there, For his efficient conduct in the chair. All. Hear! hear! [El Bogi springs up very suddenly through trap. El B. I second it. 1st Dji. Then, please, before we lose you all, Be kind enough to signify as usual. [The Geni raise their hands, and cheer. Dan. (rising.) Gents! There are customs which must be obeyed— Customs and duties Spirits can't evade. The honour done me upon this occasion, I feel convinced—that is, it's my persuasion— The—ah!—I mean—that is—I must confess— That—unaccustomed as I am to—yes— [Applause. Thank you—I feel—by your approval backed, I beg to—Hem!—sit down, in point of fact. All. Hear! hear! 1st Dji. The meeting's up, I s'pose. [They all rise. Dan. Here, stop! don't start; There's something to come in before we part. One's promises, you know, one must perform; I said I'd stand a drop of something warm. I like a real good drain, which, by the way, Is more than certain City nobs can say. [A large punch-bowl rises, with flames under it, like the witches' cauldron in “Macbeth.” El Bogi hands around drinking-cups. Danasch ladles out the beverage. SONG AND CHORUS. Music—“Macbeth.” Dan. Let's have a drain. 1st Dji. Agreed! 2d Dji. Agreed! Air—“Sir Roger de Coverley.” Dan. Care and sorrow dwindling, Mirth and splendour kindling; Let us be happy and jolly, And drink success to swindling. Chorus. Care and sorrow, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. —The Imperial City of China.—The palace gates—an immense quantity of Heads on spikes on the walls. Citizens, Mandarins, &amp;c., grouped on the Stage. A man with two posters on boards, hung round his neck, worded thus: “Lost! The Princess's Wits. Any medical gentleman restoring the same will be handsomely rewarded.” CHORUS OF CITIZENS. (“Les Huguenots.”) Did you ever! See such a sad exhibition? Doctors, clever! Brought to so sad a condition? No, I never! This is what comes of ambition, Rash endeavour! To play for such high stakes. [After Chorus they all disperse. Enter Japan, R., and Dimpl Tshin, from Palace, L. Jap. The very girl I want. Good morning, dear! A pleasant morning for the time of year. What news? Dim. The Daily News, you may be sure. Each day, to work the mad Princess's cure, Lur'd by the Emperor's promise of her hand, Fresh Doctors throng from ev'ry foreign land. Who cures may wed her; but of those who fail, [Pointing to heads on wall. Those dismal heads can tell the dismal tale; And ev'ry day up there fresh trophies puts “Heads of the People,” done on steel, with cuts. Jap. Still, spite of all, Badoura's cure I'll try, I've studied medicine upon the sly, And, after months of labour, I've compounded [Takes out a box. This patent pill, of power quite unbounded. Its qualities are soothing, safe, and mild, And may be taken by the youngest child; Sold, wholesale, retail, and for exportation, By ev'ry medicine vendor in the nation. One shilling and three half-pence, duty free; And none are genuine, unless signed by me. Dim. But please be quick, sir, for they've rung for me To carry Missus up a cup of tea. Jap. Egad! that tea suits me to one! look here, Just pop these in your lady's cup, my dear. [Gives her pills. Dim. I will. Jap. And secretly? Dim. Depend upon it. Jap. A fi'-pun note, mind, and a new chip bonnet. Dim. Yes, I must go; though folks won't think it prudent, Seeing me talking to a medical student. [Exeunt into Palace. Maimoune rises through trap, with a letter in her hand. Mai. Our Fairy Telegraphic Company, Too highly spoken of can scarcely be. But for the prompt receipt of this dispatch, I might have met with very near my match. That horrid Djinn, it seems, has form'd a plan To drag my poor dear Camaralzaman To matrimony—the ill-natured limb! What has the dear boy ever done to him? So, here he comes; but I'm distress'd to see Him keeping such disgraceful company. Now then, a sight at how things go to take, Doubly invisible myself I'll make; The Djinn himself shall not have power to view me, I'm too deep for him, though he may see through me. Enter Camaralzaman, R., with Danasch as his servant, carrying a carpet-bag. Dan. In pantomimic language, here we are! There's the abode of your beloved's Papa. Cam. Upon my word, a pretty exhibition Of “Stuck-up People”—an improv'd edition. [Looking at the heads. Dan. Yes, it's a sight for charitable souls Who like to sympathize with Distress'd Polls. Cam. But, I say, this is very kind of you, So unexpected, from a stranger, too. Dan. (modestly.) Don't mention it. Cam. Oh! I'll not be prevented, You Geni have been much misrepresented. Folks upon you all sorts of scandal fling, You're look'd upon, in fact, as not the thing. I'm sure the int'rest that you've shown in me— Bringing me here by magic—carriage free— In fact, the kindness you've evinc'd throughout, Proves you a decent sort, beyond all doubt. Dan. (aside.) Green youth! he thinks I'm doing him a kindness, When to a wife I'm leading him! what blindness! Why, of your woful case I chanc'd to learn, And, being of a philanthropic turn, I thought I'd just assist you, for a lark; But as to what I am, mind, keep it dark. I'm your attendant now. Cam. Of course, I know; Though, really, I'm ashamed to serve you so. Mai. (aside.) That of politeness is a needless stretch; No place can be too low for such a wretch. Cam. And shall I really see my soul's delight— The thief who came and stole my heart by night, And whom, in spite of all my hue and cry, And offers of reward, immensely high, I've not been fortunate enough to capture? To think these arms should take her up, oh! rapture. Knock at the door, old boy, I long to win her. [Danasch knocks at the gate. Porter appears. Dan. Emperor in? Por. He is; but he's at dinner. Dan. Then bolt! and bid his highness do the same Towards his meal; our presence here proclaim. As for his mutton, bid him cut it short. [Exit Porter. You're not afraid? Cam. I! nothing of the sort. Through scenes of danger long I've loved to stray: I've walked through Smithfield on a market day; I've sailed in penny steamers many a one; I've stood behind a cockney sportsman's gun; I've been a special. Fear, indeed! Pooh! pooh! Besides, I've every confidence in you. Enter Emperor, angrily, with a napkin under his chin, followed by Mandarins, Guards, Usher, &amp;c. Emp. Who dares to stir us up at feeding-time? Are these the miscreants guilty of the crime? Dan. Illustrious sire! for dinner do not fret! Remember what the Scotch say, “Dinna forget.” Business is business. Cease that angry shrug, And please to calm your antique China mug. [Takes out a newspaper. That's your advertisement, I think? Emp. 'Tis so. Dan. We've come to answer it. Emp. You have! Ho! ho! And p'r'aps you really think to win the prize of it. Dan. To use a strong expression, that's the size of it. Whate'er your daughter's state, my master'll save her. Emp. What! that particularly youthful shaver, Whose first shave, there is every cause to dread, Will prove to be the shaving of his head? Cam. I fear no axe nor ax-idental death, No headsman's blow shall knock me out of breath, Fetch the Princess, and, quick as presto pass, I'll work her cure; or, write me down an ass. Emp. Writing folks down is not at all our line, Although at showing people up we shine. [Pointing to the heads. Conduct the Princess hither. Cam. Now, you'll see, The Prince-in-law of China soon I'll be. [Looking off. Mai. (aside.) Not if I know it. I have form'd some plans, Which will do nicely to forbid the banns. Cam. She comes! that form! that face I cannot see, Because it's veiled! but, ah! I know 'tis she. Enter Badoura, veiled, Dimpl, and two Attendants. Bad. Throw physic to the dogs! I've had enough Of doctors' nonsense, and of doctors' stuff. No surgeons, 'pothecaries, or M.D.s, Are fit to minister to a mind's disease. Show me no more, unless you've found a man Who cures upon the homœopathic plan— Whose course of treatment, 'stead of draught or pill, Should be to show me him who made me ill. Cam. That course is mine. Bad. Who speaks? Cam. Don't look just yet; Let me recall a scene you can't forget. DUET. Tune—“Judy Callaghan.” Cam. 'Twas on a moonlight night, At three o'clock in the morning, A fair princess, as bright As rays of daylight dawning, To Camaralzaman's room Was brought by means mysterious, Set his heart in a fume, And made him with love delirious. Only say, Have some peace he shall again, Say, yes, pray, To the tune of Judy Callaghan. Bad. I thought I was dreaming then, I'm dreaming now, I vow, again; But, no, as a pike-staff plain, I see his sweet face now again. I've been uncommonly ill! But now I shall soon recover. Accept you, at once, I will, To be my devoted lover. Cam. I must say, Such luck not oft befals a man. Bad. Don't abuse it, pray, Charming Camaralzaman. [They embrace most affectionately. Cam. My life! my soul! my love! at last I've met her! Emp. I think Badoura seems a great deal better. Bad. (still embracing Camaralzaman.) My life! my love! my soul! at last we meet. Emp. We do pronounce the cure to be complete. Rejoice, ye curs! exert your lungs and breath; We bid you all be glad, on pain of death. [Mandarins shout. Prepare festivities—look sharp, ye scamps! Light up at least six thousand extra lamps, Get every sort of delicacy dressed, The pickled puppy, and the stew'd bird's-nest. Let all our land one scene of gladness be— The feast of lanterns, and the flow of tea. [Guards exeunt; Mandarins bustle about, L. Enter Japan. Jap. Who says Badoura's cured? Emp. Her royal father. And his assertions are conclusive, rather; Jap. Then do I claim her hand. Dan. Excuse me, pray! But will you just be good enough to say, Whether you'd like to have it now, or let it Stand over till such time as you can get it? Emp. (To Danasch.) Young man, a footman ought to keep his place; Don't be presuming. Now, we'll hear your case. Jap. Son of the sun, and offspring of the sky, If any one have cured your child, 'tis I! [All express astonishment. Emp. You! Jap. Yes. This morning, I, to try my skill, Popp'd in her tea a potent patent pill! Dan. He thinks your majesty a precious flat; A pill! you never mean to swallow that? Emp. Too forward, flunkey! less presumption use, We'll swallow just exactly what we choose; To show that our opinion won't be guided, We do pronounce the matter undecided, Whether our daughter to the strange young man Owes her recovery, or to Japan. Come here, our sons-in-law that wish to be, Toss up for her at once—two out of three. [Camaralzaman and Japan take coin from their pockets immediately, and toss them up, catching them, and covering them with their hands.—The Emperor stops them. Or stay, don't toss; our justice never sleeps; And, as we've set our face 'gainst Derby sweeps, To suffer gambling in our court's not right, Instead of tossing, then, suppose you fight; [Camaralzaman and Japan draw their swords, and strike fighting attitudes.—The Emperor stops them again. Or stay, don't fight; put up your sword, young person, (To Camaralzaman.) We've changed our mind. Mai. (aside.) You couldn't for a worse 'un. [They sheathe their swords. Emp. A good idea has in our brain to dwell come! Mai. (aside.) Then, as a stranger, p'r'aps you'll give it welcome. Emp. Instead of vulgar toss or angry blow, We'll have this matter settled by the bow. Jap. Beau! that means me— Cam. Not so, my rival spruce, Who'd think of saying “bo” to such a goose? Emp. Silence! you two, for our fair child competing, Shall shoot for her; we'll call an archery meeting. If anybody feels inclined to say Our plan is not first-rate in ev'ry way, Sublime, ingenious, just, and wise supremely, To catch him at it, we should like extremely; Bad. This is, indeed, one's dignity abridgin' Have your child shot for like a Red-House pigeon. [Crosses to R. Mai. Then I've a plan; my arts shall discompose The rival arrows of these rival beaux. [Exit, L. Cam. This is a swindle! [Crosses to Badoura. Emp. Ha! I cannot suffer— Dan. (interrupting him.) Now, don't be angry, there's a worthy buffer; He is but young, wants self-control, you see, He'd ne'er be out of trouble but for me, To whose care, by his fond and doating mammy, He was confided. Would you, Master Cammy? [Winks at Camaralzaman. You didn't mean the Emp'ror to annoy? [Aside. Don't be afraid, I'll make all right, my boy. Cam. (aside.) I understand; my liege, I beg your pardon. Emp. Well, for this once, your fault we won't be hard on; What, ho! to all the sporting papers send, And let them know that we this match intend To come off soon. The bow—the bow's the thing By which this matter to a close I'll bring. CONCERTED. Tune—“A famous Man was Robin Hood.” Emp. Oh! a famous man was Robin Hood, And, as an archer, made a noise; And I think, if I were you, I should Just try a leaf to borrow from his book, my boys. Cam. For aught that he can do, who cares? Jap. I've skill, and tidy strength of arm. Dan. (aside to Camaralzaman.) We'll do his business unawares, I'll take good care you're kept from harm. Chorus. A famous man was Robin Hood, &amp;c. [Exeunt. Scene II. —The Fairy Boudoir of Maimoune. Enter Taffeta and Filma, C. Fil. Pray, is your mistress in? Taf. I hardly know, I'll go and see; what name, ma'am? Fil. Filma! Taf. Oh! To you, of course, she's in; but, truth to tell, She's lately been so very far from well, She can't see any visitors. Fil. Poor dear! Just be so kind as tell her I am here. [Exit Taffeta. I've called on dear Maimoune to impart Some news that must go nigh to break her heart! When grief and suffering our bosoms rend, There's nothing like a real, good-natured friend. Enter Maimoune and Attendants, C. Good morning, dear! why, you look downright gay; You smile as you were wont to smile to-day. Mai. Oh! yes, I'm quite recovered, thank you, dear; (Aside.) The spiteful thing! I know what brings her here. Fil. I've called to tell you something. Mai. (aside.) Oh! no doubt, But on a subject I know all about. Fil. Prince Camaralzaman— Mai. Well! Fil. Oh! my dear— It will be dreadful news to you, I fear; He's going to be married. Mai. Yes! Fil. (aside.) Plague take her! I thought to faint with horror it would make her; Don't you feel sorry? Mai. Couldn't, if I tried, As I myself intend to be the bride. Fil. You? Mai. Yes! Fil. You're joking! Mai. Joking—'faith, not I; The die is cast. Fil. Oh! never say that die, You said that you'd forget him! Mai. P'r'aps I did, But my heart wouldn't do as it was bid; Come, be my bridesmaid. Fil. Nothing of the sort, You ought to be ashamed, miss, so you ought, To think of such an ill-assorted marriage. Mai. Be good enough to call this lady's carriage. Fil. Oh, certainly! with pleasure, ma'am—good day! Peri. (entering.) The Lady Filma's carriage stops the way. Fil. (aside.) A splendid bit of scandal this will be; I'll ask some friends this very night to tea. [Exit. Mai. Delightful task! to aid my tender suit, And teach his young idea how to shoot; With magic I my prince's dart will tip, That to the judges it may give the slip— He'll seek it; it will lead him to my arms, And so my spells will beat Badoura's charms. Now, girls, away! make every preparation To welcome him as does become his station; Let music's silver strains his ears delight, Not common fiddlers hired for the night, At half-a-crown an hour and their beer, But regular fairy music let him hear; And bid our fairy butler furnish, too, A dozen of our fine old crusty dew; Then, fly! and get our wedding-dresses made By the most stylish Peris in the trade. At once, now; see my wishes acquiesced in, [Exeunt Peris, Meanwhile I'll practise looking interesting. My dress and figure I had better see to, I'll practise to my shadow, like Cerito. Shine out, fair moon, that I my form may view, [Strong light at wing, L., to throw a shadow on the stage. All the other lights down. Thank you! some day I'll do as much for you; [Dances the Pas de l'Ombre. My looks ain't bad—no skill could well advance 'em, If he stands them, he must stand something handsome. [Resumes dance. Oh, dear! oh, dear! my wings are rather crumpled, Yes, and my bustle seems a little rumpled [Adjusts her dress by the shadow; resumes dance, and exit, L. Scene III. —An Archery Ground, laid out à la Cremorne, Rosherville, &amp;c.; stuffed figures of soldiers, targets, &amp;c., about; men, in Lincoln green, in attendance.—A raised seat for the Emperor. Enter the Emperor, attended by Guards, Mandarins, &amp;c.; Japan and Camaralzaman, with bows and arrows in their hands.—Danasch in attendance on Camaralzaman.— Badoura, and her Attendants, &amp;c. CHORUS. (Hunting Chorus from “Der Freischutz.”) Now forward, young men, for this Princess contending, Her father commands you to draw the long bow; And there's such a prize on your shooting depending, That all your best skill we'd advise you to show. For, oh! she's a treasure that's worthy of princes, With charms more than Cocker can ever compute; Each moment her form some new beauty evinces; So just mind your eye, and take care how you shoot. Now, my lucky sportsmen! step forward, and try your luck! Forward! forward! &amp;c. Emp. Daughter, you look the picture of distress; A sorry sample of a Prize Princess. Bad. (weeps.) I can't help crying—mingled doubts and fears Transform my 'kerchief to a veil of tears. It's wringing wet—a perfect sheet of water. Emp. Say a wet blanket on our mirth, my daughter. [She sobs. Come, come! unless you mean to drop that din, Get out, or rather, I should say, get in. Bad. Well, p'r'aps I'd better, for the match would be A truly 'arrowing spectacle to me; (To Camaralzaman.) Sweet prince! may Fortune take you in her care! Dim. (aside.) Master's a brute—I always thought he were. [Exeunt Badoura, Dimpl, and Attendants. Dan. Now then, old chap! it's time we made a start; Suppose we do so. Emp. Oh! with all my heart! You understand, who shoots the farthest, wins— And only one shot each—Japan begins. Cam. (aside to Danasch.) All's right, you say? Dan. (aside, in reply.) Correct as any trivet! Strength to your arrow I'll take care and give it. [Japan shoots. Jap. Badoura's mine! Cam. Don't halloo out just yet, Out of the wood you first had better get. [Shoots; all start with astonishment. Dan. There! Emp. Where? Cam. Ay! where? who saw my arrow fall? Att. Please, sir, I think it didn't fall at all. SONG. Tune—“Blue Bells of Scotland.” Cam. Oh! where, and oh! where, is my flighty arrow gone? Dan. Oh! it's gone a great deal farther than I meant it to have flown! And, it's oh! in my heart that I can't tell where it's gone. Chorus. Then it's oh! in his heart, &amp;c. Jap. (to Emperor.) Suppose, and suppose, that his arrow can't be found? Emp. He must lose the match, of course, for being such a stupid hound! Jap. Then, it's oh! in my heart, that I hope it can't be found. Chorus. Then, it's oh! in his heart, &amp;c. Cam. I've shot it out of sight, that's it, no doubt— But, wait a minute, I'll soon find it out. [Runs after his arrow. Dan. (aside.) It strikes me, Miss Maimoune's been at work, My nicely-plann'd contrivances to burk; If so, I think I'd better cut and run, But, ere I do, egad! I'll have some fun. Emp. What! can't he find it? Where can he have tossed it? Zounds! if the stupid fellow's been and lost it, Why, he deserves to lose the lady too. Jap. Hear! hear! I quite agree with you! Dan. You do? Well! I'm not one who at conclusions jumps; But, really, you're a precious set of pumps. Emp. and Jap. Pumps! Mands. &amp;c. Pumps! Dan. Yes, pumps! his highness in particular. Emp. (infuriate.) Our royal pigtail stands out perpendicular With rage! our pow'r of breathing almost ceases; Slaves! chop him up in several little pieces. [Guards rush at Danasch with weapons; he stands with his arms folded, looking contemptuously at them. Japan interrupts them. Jap. A moment stay! my liege, a boon I crave— Let me dispose of this presumptuous slave. Emp. Well, if to you 'twill any pleasure bring, Here, slaves, fall back, and give the prince a ring! [Music.—Japan draws his sword, and rushes at Danasch, who draws his, and defends himself. Broadsword Combat. Danasch is stabbed, but he only throws up his arms and laughs. Jap. You harden'd monster! where's your feelings, pray? I'll try and touch them now, where'er they lay. [Fight renewed. Danasch stabbed, and laughs as before. Japan becomes infuriated, stabs Danasch several times, at each of which he laughs. At last he stabs Japan, and with an O. Smith-like laugh sinks through trap, from which a flame arises. Japan falls. Perdition catch thine arm— Emp. (astonished.) There's none to catch; Your friend's gone off, just like a Congreve match, Smelling like those—three boxes for a penny! Jap. (feebly.) He was a match for me, and one too many; I'm pepper'd; yes, I'm summon'd to that bourne From which commercial trav'llers ne'er return. [Dies. Emp. I think—although I don't for certain know— I'm justified in saying, here's a go! One son-in-law cut off—but where's the other? Att. Please, sir, he's cut off too. Emp. Now, that's a bother; If of the candidates we lose the two, What for a husband will Badoura do? Here, find him out—every exertion make— Tell him there must have been a slight mistake; As for the dart which play'd him such a trick, Tell him that needn't in his gizzard stick! [Guards bear off Japan. SOLO AND CHORUS. (Eclipse Polka.) [Emp.] That you find him, have a care; And you'd better, I declare, In a jiffey, If ye Really Dearly Prize the heads you wear. Chorus. We to find him must take care; And we'd better, I declare, In a jiffey, If we, &amp;c. [Exeunt Mandarins, &amp;c., running to look for Camaralzaman, L. Scene IV. —A romantic woody Landscape.—A rock, with a door, with knocker and two bells, one marked “Visitors,” the other “Servants.” An arrow flies in, and sticks in the stage, near the door; Camaralzaman runs in fatigued and panting after it; as soon as it falls, he pounces upon it. Cam. So, sir, you've taken arrow-root, at last; I thought you'd tire of going it so fast. [Takes it up. I've follow'd it for miles a dozen quite. Now, were I to describe this arrow's flight. People would call it, without hesitation, Merely a flight of my imagination. Faith, now I've lost my way; a pretty scrape I've got into—through what? an arrow escape! SONG. Air—“Coming through the Rye.” Ne'er a body, such a noddy, Prov'd himself as I; Miles I've walk'd to lose my way, I'm half inclin'd to cry. I've traps'd thro' forests, bogs, and swamps, O'er vales and mountains high, Coming thro' the wet and dirt, And coming thro' the dry. If a body's such a noddy, Such a careless loon, He deserves whate'er he gets, For being such a spoon; But, 'pon my word, it's most annoying, Fagg'd to death am I With coming thro' the wet and dirt, And coming thro' the dry. (Seeing the door.) Why, here's a house that Nature's help'd to fix; The rocks have acted here like regular bricks. I'll see who's in—I'm sure I may as well— They'll aid me, p'r'aps. I'll please to ring the bell. [Rings. Taffeta and Peris in bridal dresses, with veils, wedding favours, &amp;c., come out. Well, really, I do meet the queerest things— A lot of pretty girls, with veils and wings! Taf. Welcome, sweet prince! Cam. That's very kind of you. Taf. We've been expecting you. Cam. Come, that won't do. Taf. What! doubt a lady's word? Oh! fie! forshame! Prince Camaralzaman, I think? Cam. (startled.) My name! You've seen my picture in some print-shop window. Taf. Not so, indeed; but don't stand here—come in, do. Cam. Your manner, certainly, of kindness savours, And you've already shown me lots of favours, [Pointing to rosettes. Which, by-the-bye, induce me to suppose Some of your party must be bless'd with beaux, With whom you're going to be tied up;—in fact, You've met to perpetrate some marriage act. Peri. We have—so please to join our wedding party; You're a nice man for one. Cam. Well, now, that's hearty; You want me for a groomsman, I dare say, Or a papa, to give the bride away. Well, I shall be most happy, I declare, In your Heart Union dodge to take a share. [Exeunt into cave. Scene the Last. —The Peris' Home.—Maimoune seated in bridal array, surrounded by Peris as bridesmaids.—A banquet prepared.—Music. Mai. The time draws near. I'm sadly flushed and shaken; I hope too rash a step I have not taken, And put my foot in it. Should he be cold, And deem my husband-catching schemes too bold, He may think (having of what's right a high sense) I've sought to wed him with an undue licence. Ha! here he comes; my trepidation's great— I shall receive him in a funny state. Enter Camaralzaman, conducted by Taffeta and the Peris. Cam. Nothing but magic can I set down this to. This grotto quite surpasses Monte Christo. This dazzling splendour sets me fairly blinking, Shutting my eyes up like—in fact, like winking. [Seeing Maimoune and Peris. More marriage belles! and, faith, a pretty lot; But for the gentlemen, I see them not; And you'll admit, I think, my question's sensible, Isn't a bridegroom rather indispensable? Mai. Excuse the boldness of my invitation; But, prince, would you accept that situation? Cam. You're joking, lady. Mai. Sweet bird, do not laugh; To catch you is my wish, but not with chaff. The marriage preparations that you see Are for the union of you and me. Cam. What? do you think, because you choose to make A wedding feast, that I'm to be the cake? Me marry you—marry, come up! not I. Mai. You wont? oh, crimini! in fact, oh, cry! You must be mad, sir, to refuse the match. Consider, I'm no ordinary catch; My wealth and influence possess no bounds; Just look at my establishment and grounds. Cam. Good grounds, no doubt; but still not good enough For my accepting you on. Cease this stuff. One maid alone can ever be my bride, To whom I'm bound, though not exactly tied. Mai. Throw off that tie, 'twill give you no great shock, And in its stead take my entire stock. DUET. Tune—“Green Bushes.” Mai. Oh, let us be married, young man, if you please, In these fairy domains you may live at your ease, From bailiffs and creditors perfectly free, If you'll leave your own true love, and marry with me. Cam. Oh, I care not for riches; you needn't suppose I've a spirit so poor as to marry for those; And of you my opinion much higher would be, If you'd show a few blushes at making so free. Mai. (aside.) He's twice as obstinate as any pig; If he is not, why, dash my Peri-wig! I've half a mind, for the contempt you've shown, To change you to a block of solid stone; But, no, you're that already. Cam. Nay, be pacified; And, though as man and wife we can't be classified, Let us be friends. Refuse I'm sure you'll not. Come, and I'll tell you what to do. Mai. Well! what? Cam. Why, all your guests here—it's a shame to cheat 'em, And all the dainties—some one ought to eat 'em; There ought to be a wedding, that's quite clear. Mai. Well? Cam. Fetch the young princess of China here, And, 'pon my word, I'll marry her. Mai. No doubt! (Aside.) But really it's a chance for coming out, And showing off a little magnanimity; 'Twill be a struggle of intense sublimity. I'll give him up, though it may cost me pain:— There, now! Maimoune is herself again. All human weaknesses away I pitch; I'll be a Peri, and behave as sich. [Music. The scene at the back opens, and the Emperor and Badoura enter in a fairy triumphal car. Cam. I didn't want the venerable gent. Mai. I brought him here to give you his consent. (To Emperor.) Now, ask no questions; don't stand gaping there, But give your blessing to the youthful pair. [Maimoune joins their hands; Emperor puts his hands on their heads, after the most approved benediction fashion. Emp. Anything else in my way, just at present? Mai. Nothing! Bad. Well, this is odd, but very pleasant. [A loud rat-tat knocking is heard, and a bell rings. Mai. Which of our bidden guests such uproars bring? Hope they don't call that a wedding ring. Enter Danasch, R., sprucely dressed. You're the rap-rascal, then, that made that row? Dan. If I've offended, I'll knock under now. I've called to say, that I've been thinking over My past career. I'm sick of being a rover. I've cut my bad associates already, And mean to try to be a little steady; So p'r'aps, if I improve in my propriety, You'll introduce me to some good society. Mai. (aside.) Well, I don't know—he looks extremely well— He may be worth one's notice, who can tell? Partners are scarce; and, bound in Hymen's tether, We might get on extremely well together. (To Danasch.) Come here—I will—yes, thus my love confessing; [Gives her hand. I've got no Pa—will you please give your blessing? [To audience. Cam. Yes, let us your approving voices hear, And for our wedding-feast provide the cheer. FINALE. Air—“Jolly Nose.” Cam. Jolly rows of bright faces, which garnish our Pit, All looking good-natured and merry; And those happy forms in the Boxes that sit, Are cheering to look upon, very. Emp. Jolly rows, too, you'll see, if your eyes you will cast In a rather more lofty direction; And I fancy they don't to our efforts just past Entertain the profoundest objection. Air—“Old Dan Tucker.” Bad. Now, all I want this very night, Is to hear a noise, to see a sight; The noise, your hands applauding sounds, The sight, your face without frowns— Dan. Get out of the way, I'll address them, And with some eloquence of mine impress them! Air—“Who's dat Knocking at de Door?” Oh, I've just come to say, that we really ought to be— Mai. I think you'd better let the matter rest with me. I've tried 'em once or twice, I think, ere now, And pleased with what I say they always seem somehow. Air—“Buffalo Gals.” Then with your applause won't you come out to-night? Oh, grant us that one boon! Chorus. Then with your applause, &amp;c.</field>
