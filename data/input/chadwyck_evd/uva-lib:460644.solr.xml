      <field name="fulltext">HARLEQUIN AND THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT; OR, OLD MOTHER HUBBARD, AND HER WONDERFUL DOG:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Domicile Erected by John. [Being a poetic paraphrase of the ancient nursery legend, for the use of the rising generation, who might consider the simplicity of the original beneath them.] Behold the mansion swift upreared for Jack! See the malt stored in many an ample sack. Mark how the rat's felonious fangs invade The golden stores in John's pavilion laid. See how, with velvet foot and noiseless strides, Subtle grimalkin to his quarry glides; Grimalkin grim, that slew the fierce rodent, Whose tooth insidious Johann's sackcloth rent. Lo! now the deep-mouthed canine foe's assault, That vexed the avenger of the stolen malt, Stored in the hallowed precincts of that hall, That rose complete at Jack's creative call. Now stalks the impetuous cow, with crumpled horn, Whereon the exacerbating hound was torn, Who bayed the feline slaughtered beast that slew The rat predaceous, whose keen fangs ran through The textile fibres that involved the grain, That lay in John's inviolate domain. Behold the damsel, all forlorn, who drew Lactiferous spoils, in meadows pearled with dew, From that corniculate beast, whose tortuous horn Tossed to the clouds, in fierce vindictive scorn, The braying hound, whose braggart bark and stir, Arched the lithe spine, and reared the indignant fur Of puss, that, with verminicidal claw, Struck the scared rat, in whose insatiate maw, Lay reeking malt that erst in Johann's home we saw. Robed in a garb whose fabric seemed, in sooth, To show deep dents from Time's corroding tooth, Behold the man whose loving lips incline To meet the lips, in colour coralline, Of that lorn maiden, whose experienced hands Drew albulactic wealth from lacteal glands Of that immortal bovine, by whose horn, Distort to realms ethereal was borne The frisking, whisking worrier of that sly, Soft-footed quadruped, who caused to die The old mordaceous rat, that dared devour Antecedaneous ale in John's domestic bower. And now, with hirsute honours doff'd, succinct Of saponaceous locks, the priest, who linked In Hymen's golden bands the man unthrift, Whose means exiguous stared from many a rift, E'en as he kissed the virgin, all forlorn, Who milked the cow with complicated horn, Who, in fierce wrath, the canine torturer skied, That dared to vex the insidious muricide, That through the hide let rays of daylight fly, Of that rash rat that robbed John's granary. The loud cantankerous bantam comes at last, Whose shouts aroused the shorn ecelesiast, Who sealed the vows of Hymen for the man, Whose time-worn garments all to seed had ran, But kissed the damsel who, at early morn, Had milked the cow that had the crumpled horn, That tossed the dog, that vexed the cat, that kilt The rat, that ate the malt, in House that Jack had built.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. —INTERIOR OF OLD MOTHER HUBBARD'S COTTAGE. Sunset, with rural landscape, and old Manor-Hall in the distance.— Large practicable window.—Door and cupboard, both practicable. —Large old-fashioned fireplace at side, with wood-fire burning, and large kettle swinging above it.—Old kitchen clock, pointing nearly to the hour of five, table, and three chairs. Rosetta discovered, with house-broom in her hand, gazing through window, on preparations going on for festivities—Peal of Bells heard ringing, as Curtain rises, then shouts of Villagers, bearing garlands and decked with holiday favors, who are seen to pass at the back of the stage.—Two Constables, a party of country folks, in a cart, drawn by a pony, &amp;c., all going to welcome the new 'Squire. Rosetta. Ay! there they go, to look at me they scorn. I am, alas! ‘a maiden all forlorn!’ Of one kind word I'm sure, when Jack goes by, But then poor Jack is just as poor as I. [More Villagers—more shouting. They hasten on to welcome the young 'Squire Of Rookwood Manor, left him by his sire. To-morrow there's a feast and grand procession, For then he comes of age, and takes possession. [Shouts without, ‘Mad Dog!’—Rabid Music.—The Dog jumps in through the window with old tin-kettle tied to his tail.—He races rapidly round the stage, and then takes refuge at Rosetta's feet. Poor dog! did naughty boys his head assail? And did they tie tin-kettles to his tail? [Releasing him, whilst Dog expresses gratitude. Well, never mind them—he's a good old boys— You are not so bad as they, with all their noise! [Laying tea-things. Its five o'clock—where can your mistress be? You see I've got all ready for her tea. [Music.—Dog goes to table, indicates tea-things, snatches Rosetta's apron, makes a parcel of it, and imitates the action of an old woman returning from market. Oh! at the chandler's shop, you mean, she closer is, Laying in all her little stock of groceries. [Dog indicates the affirmative. And whilst the Dame was there, the village throng Tied that old kettle and chased you along? [Dog nods. Ah! she'll make them repent it, never fear. The good old Dog! But see, the Dame is here! Marked Music.—Dog goes to the door and pulls in Old Mother Hubbard, expressing extravagant signs of delight.—The dame has a large basket of parcels, tea, sugar, butter, &amp;c., which she puts on the table, then fondles Dog, who expresses extravagant delight at her return. Mother H. The tiresome knaves, they won't leave us alone, But I've got something for him—here's a bone. [Goes to the cupboard, and finds plate on shelf empty. Hollo! what's this? There was one here, I'm sure! The cupboard's bare—so, you had known before! [The Dog enjoys the fun. I'm very angry! You may frisk along, But this behaviour, sir, is very wrong. Now, at the baker's, I must get some bread; I've a good mind to bring a stick instead. [Threatens Dog, who crouches down.—Exit Mother Hubbard. Rosetta. That mutton bone—'twas very bad to thieve; You shouldn't take things without asking leave. [Music.—Dog puts his paws together, and with a piteous, penitent how, and after a few seeming struggles, becomes apparently lifeless. Good gracious me! It's really my belief, The poor old Dog has gone and died of grief! Mother Hubbard returns, with a loaf, which she puts on the table. Mother H. Well, here's the loaf—what's this? Rosetta. You well may start, He took your angry words so much to heart, That when you left, he pined, through grief, away. Mother H. Oh, dear! oh, dear! alas! alack-a-day! That ever it should be! my poor old Dog! Now to the undertaker's must I jog. A lonely body here I'm left, i'fegs, again! Just one more look! Ha, ha! he's on his legs again. [Dog gets up and dances joyfully. The rascal laughs! ha, ha! 'twas so abrupt, too. I ought to have known the tricks he would be up to. I've been so flurried, that, white wine or red, A glass I must have—there! he's on his head. [Dame gets wine from cupboard, and drinks.—Dog stands on his head.—Clock strikes five. The funny fellow! Hark! the clock strikes five! Dame Wiggins and Dame Trot will soon arrive. I've asked them both to tea, just for a change; We've got some private business to arrange. They are generally punctual to the minute, Look to the kettle—see there's water in it, And mind it boils. Of tea I'll put enough in; And here take this, I know they like a muffin! [Mother Hubbard arranges tea-things, gives muffins to Rosetta, who goes to fireplace, takes stool, and sits down to toast them.—Dog amuses himself by looking out of the window—he then barks. Mother H. That bark announces some one—Dame Trot, is it her? [Dog shakes his head. Dame Wiggins, then, of Lee, my other visitor? Dog nods, and goes to the door, through which enters Dame Wiggins, of Lee, attended by her Goose—the Dame has a rude country appearance, and behaves accordingly, without ceremony—they exchange a kiss of salutation, and Dame Wiggins puts her pattens and umbrella in the corner, over which Goose keeps guard.—Dame sits down, after taking off her outer cloak.—Dog returns to window. Mother H. You've had a good long walk here, as I guess, ma'am. Glad of a cup of tea, I dare say?— Dame W. Yes, ma'am! The road's be pratty well, but, with my goose, too, I'm not so good at stiles, ma'am, as I used to. [Dog barks. Mother H. Dame Trot! she comes from London by the stage, I haven't seen the old lady for an age! Music.—Enter Dame Trot and her Cat.—The Dame is very affected and ceremonious—she salutes the others, with great formality, by low obeisance, imitated by Dog and Cat, in the background.—Dame Trot takes her seat in very stately fashion.—Dog and Cat have a characteristic disagreement, but, under a threat of chastisement, peace is restored.—Mother Hubbard presides at the head of the table, and makes the tea. Mother H. A tedious journey, by the coach arriving; A cup of tea, I know, will prove reviving, Pray make yourselves at home—do you take cream, ma'am? I hope I've made it sweet enough—just see, ma'am! Dame T. This beverage suits me mightily, I protest, We folks of quality well know the best. I vow that your brown bread is quite a treat. A small French roll is all, in town, I eat. Mother H. Now bring the muffins; come, Rosetta, child! [Rosetta hands them round, then places milk in basin, for Cat. Dame T. A comely-looking damsel! rather wild; But then, she lacks the polish of the town. Dame W. Ah! thank ye, lass, I likes 'em thick and brown! [Dame Wiggins possesses herself of a handful, which excites the visible horror of Dame Trot.—At a sign from Mother Hubbard, Rosetta retires. Dame T. [Aside.] These country persons are so unrefined. Mother H. I hope your tea that both agreeable find. Another? [Handing muffin to Dame Trot. Dame T. Thanks, my appetite's departed, I had a dish of chocolate ere I started. [Rises—comes forward. You must find this place dull in wint'ry weather, When, with your Dog, you can't get out together. [Mother Hubbard rises, and gets small dog's hat. Mother H. I went to buy him, yesterday, a hat. Where is he? see he's feeding your good cat! [Dog feeds Cat with a spoon. The hosier's, too, supplied some good warm hose. Behold him, there! he's dressed in his new clothes! [The Dog, finding himself the subject of general attention, has got his wardrobe out of the lower part of the cupboard, and dressed himself accordingly. He knows he's going on an expedition, And, so, he's getting ready for his mission. [Music. The Dame made a curtsey, the Dog made a bow, The Dame said, your servant, the Dog said— Dog. ‘Bow-wow!’ [Dame Wiggins having ate to the last, rises, and comes to the front. Dame W. Well, I be pratty full—I can't eat more. Mother H. Then now to work, and get our business o'er. You know, this meeting was some purpose meant for, Now I'll inform you why you thus were sent for. [Cat and Dog pay great attention at the back.—Mother Hubbard in centre, Dame Wiggins on one side, Dame Trot on the other. SONG, Mother Hubbard.—Air, ‘Tippitiwichet.’ [Music published by the Music-Publishing Company, 19 Peter's Hill, St. Paul's, in Nos. 823–23?, of the Musical Treasury, price 6d.] To-morrow morning handy, The 'Squire his gold will touch, But, as wicked as he can be, He won't enjoy it much. This 'Squire so proud, has vowed aloud, To have his wicked away; But soon he'll see, what quickly he Will for it have to pay. It is the 'Squire's intention, Us witches all to burn; But out, I needn't mention, We'll serve him in return. We'll blight his hops, destroy his crops, And leave to rot his hay; And make disease his cattle seize, Till they wither in the middle all away. Now the point I'm going, This night I want you all, Some fatal spell bestowing, Upon him to let fall. Ha, ha! such fun, as good as done, He won't have his own way; Ah! he may snub, but Mother Hub- Bard's dog will have his day. Cat. Ah-cheu! at-cheu! Dog. Booh-wooh! booh-wooh! Mother H. They well know what we say. Cat. Atch ich-chew. Mother H. That's a rum un'. Dog. Booh-wooh. Cat. Atch-oo. Mother H. 'Twill do. We'll find out the riddle of the way. Dame W. I'll give thee a wind! Mother H. You will! that's very kind! Dame T. And I, disasters plentiful will find. Trap him with pitfalls, when he hunting goes, Which won't improve the outline of his nose. Dame W. I'll do the mischief to his crops, good mother. Mother H. Thanks, thanks! then I myself have all the other. This night we'll to the witches' glen repair, And let our sisters in the glory share. My faithful Dog a message there shall carry. Take this—you needn't for an answer tarry. [Mother Hubbard writes on tablet, and fastens it to the Dog's collar. So, so, sir 'Squire, what rest in peace we shan't do? Burn witches, would you? which is what you can't do! [Quick Music.—Tumult without—Villagers, with 'Squire, causing Jack to be dragged along by Constables, are seen to pass the window— the door is burst open, and they all come in—Rosetta, attracted by excitement, returns.—Cat and Goose quietly get out of the way. —Group. Mother H. Hollo! what's this? how now? you've come enough in. Jack. It's the 'Squire, here, says I'm a ragamuffin. Because my coat ain't quite so good as his'n. He threatens that he'll send me off to prison. I work when I can get but wages fairish. 'Squire. [Foppishly.] I won't have any vagrants in my parish. If dad gave wages you could get a meal with, You'll find you have now a different chap to deal with. Away with him, I say! Mother H. [Interposing.] Your pardon, 'Squire, This lad was a great favorite with your sire: His good, kind heart, our village here well knows, Don't punish him for wearing ragged clothes! Whate'er he earns, amongst the poor he scatters, Give tit for tat, but not that hit for tatters. 'Squire. Have you the least idea, you beldame ugly, To whom you are giving your advice so smugly? Mother H. To one who's just come into an estate, It's very clear he can't appre-ci-ate. [Constables whisper 'Squire. 'Squire. I thought as much. This hag is an old witch. Mother H. If you're a gentleman, behave as sitch. [Keeping him at a distance with her broom. Rosetta. [Crossing.] Dear Jack, they dare not harm you; I know clearly Your honest heart, and love you for it dearly. 'Squire. So-ho! a rustic beauty—I'll console her; You're much too pretty, lass, for such a stroller. [Rosetta indignantly repulses him—'Squire advances to Mother Hubbard. Here, tell my fortune by the grouts, and speak up; What fate's in store, at the bottom of the tea-cup? [Takes up tea-cup and hands it to her. Mother H. One you need not be proud of; here, I see A disappointment, plain as plain can be. In all your plans, good luck will not attend you, Here is a stranger, too, who won't befriend you; As for the rest— 'Squire. Cease, hag, I'll hear no more. Mother H. You'll be more hated than you were before. 'Squire. If I've bad fortune, first you shall partake of it. Mother H. Take it yourself, then see what you can make of it. [Dashes contents of cup in 'Squire's face. 'Squire. Come, burn the witch, and seize on her familiar. At once we'll put her on the fire. Mother H. Oh! will yer? Hey—presto—fly! Dog springs through the window, upsetting Constables, who seize Mother Hubbard. He's safe—the Dog defies you. Don't you be too familiar, I advise you. 'Squire. There are two more—at once seize every one of them. Mother H. Hey cockalorum jig—you now sees none of them. [Dame Wiggins and Dame Trot disappear at each side in scene. 'Squire. Foiled! desperation!—but this one shall rue it. [Constables force Mother Hubbard towards the fire-place. Mother H. What ho! my broomstick! that's the way to do it. Kettle, get up your steam, and blow a cloud— This is my riot act to disperse a crowd! [Music.—Mother Hubbard vanishes on her Broomstick up the chimney— kettle upsets over 'Squire and Constables, greatly to their discomfiture—cloud spread over stage, through which Mother Hubbard is seen, ascending on her Broomstick, and when it disappears, there is revealed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. —THE WITCHES' GLEN, BY MOONLIGHT. Dog is seen, with a letter on his collar, to pass across the stage.—The Witches then appear, and form a picturesque Tableau. 1st Witch. The Dog announces Mother Hubbard's near. 2nd Witch. She comes, and on her broomstick—she is here! Mother Hubbard descends—Dame Wiggins and Dame Trot rise through trap. Mother H. Where's Wiggins! Dame W. Here! Mother H. And Trot? Dame T. Here too. Mother H. We want but you—now we shall do! [Invocation with Broomsticks through Music. Three times three to thee and mine, Three times three we know are nine. Health to thee and health to me, And health to each, with three times three. [Lambent Lights seen in the distance, then nearer. Peace! the charm's wound up! from yonder fen, Will-o'-the-Wisp now dances up the glen. Enter Will-o'-the-Wisp. Will. Why am I summoned from my marshes damp, To attend this meeting with my pale blue lamp? What traveller do you seek to lead astray? Mother H. One who's already going the wrong way. The good old 'Squire who once, in Rookwood Hall, Feasted the great, but ne'er forget the small, Has just departed, and to him succeeds, Heir to the Manor, one of evil deeds, Who will to-morrow be the 'Squire instead. Will. This to a lawyer should, methinks, be said. Mother H. His legal claim is good, that none dispute; It's his bad manner that, you see, don't suit. He turns out all his tenants in their need; In fact, he turns out very bad indeed. Will. And you would teach him—known to but a few 'tis— That property with rights has also duties? Mother H. Exactly so: why, when he gets his riches, He's going to make a bonfire of us witches! [Sensation. Will. That must not be! Mother H. I rather think it mustn't! Will. It doesn't seem the thing. Mother H. Indeed it doesn't! Will. An incantation—let the cauldron rise; We'll call up those who can the best advise. Music.—The Witches' Cauldron rises. Mother H. Round about the cauldron go, Throw in all the charms you know. Wiggins, Trot, alone beware, Who have not got charms to spare! All. Double, double—don't mind trouble! In with all that makes a bubble! Mother H. The enamel off a lady's face, Which twenty guineas cost to place! Dame T. Three hairs from a gorilla riven. Mother H. A lecture that was on him given. Dame W. Some money that a bank did sack again; Deposited, and not got back again. Dame T. A piece of rope folks upwards looked on, To see a pancake made and cooked on. Mother H. Two drops of human perspiration, Caused by a thrilling ‘great sensation.’ Dame W. A flower from a large bouquet, Flung to an actress at the play, But on a fiddler's head alighted. Dame T. The part which that applause excited. Mother H. Now add thereto, the gloves that called her on, For the ingredients of our cauldron. All. Double, double—fig for trouble! In with all that makes a bubble! Tell us what we want to know. Thyself and office plainly show. Head of a large Baby rises. Baby. [Very solemnly.] Deedle, deedle, dumpling! my son, John, He went to bed with his stockings on; One shoe off, but the other shoe on, Deedle, deedle, dumpling! my son, John. [Baby disappears. Mother H. Whatever you may mean, my pretty dear, I must confess you don't make very clear;— Speak plain— Will. He won't! of babies that's the worst. Here is another who has nursed the first. Head of an old Nurse rises. Nurse. Dame Trot! Dame Trot! Dame Trot! Dame T. Had I three ears I'd hear thee, but I've not, With all I have I pay profound attention. Mother H. Hush! it's important what she's going to mention! Nurse. [In solemn tones.] 'Squire, 'Squire! blow the fire! Jack is as good as his master; But he shall have but one penny per day, Unless he can work much faster. [Disappears. Mother H. The plan that they suggest becomes more plain, One for his nob—the Jack turns up again. Yet, stay—of more advice I fain would draw yer. Will. Throw six-and-eightpence in and get a Lawyer! [Mother Hubbard does so. Head of Lawyer rises. Lawyer. List! Mother Hubbard, plaintiff in this cause, To one—cap. thirty-six—of Forest Laws. Whoever builds, between the night and morn, On common ground, a house well stored with corn, That house is his, and all he has that land in, All to the contrary nevertheless notwithstanding. [Disappears. Mother H. As right as ninepence! Jack's the lad, I see! For him we'll build that house immediately. And we'll make him, the tattered youth, aspire, To be as great a personage as the 'Squire. At once upon our errand we'll away; Jack's house we'll build between a night and day. Will. Now to my marshy home I haste away, To lead this saucy 'Squire still more astray. Beauty is always going to a dawn, So you may keep your revels up till morn. [Will-'o-the-Wisp disappears.—The Dames Trot, Wiggins, and Hubbard go off, and the rest express their delight in a GRAND BALLET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. —THE VILLAGE-GREEN, AND ROAD-SIDE ALE-HOUSE. Noon.—Animated Music.—Peasantry enter, Old Tenants with bags of money, papers, agreements, &amp;c.—they take up their position by the Ale-house porch, whence a rustic table, bench, and stool are brought out.—Enter Old Gryppe, the steward, with book, papers, &amp;c. Gryppe. Now stand aside, the 'Squire will soon arrive, Pay up your rents, and mind you look alive. [Sits down at table, places writing materials; Tenants reluctantly come up in succession, those who come up quickly paying their money. Hallo! Giles Oatcake, two years' rent you owe, Can't? don't tell me: pay all, or out you go! Now Humphrey Whackstraw, here there's no excuse should do. Pooh! if your crops fail, that's no reason you should do. I carry out the new 'Squire's resolution; All who don't pay will have an execution. [Steward rises from table—general grumbling. What! do you grumble, knaves? look pleased, this minute! Laugh, every one of you—at once begin it! [Dismal effort at laughter, which the Steward enforces from the Tenantry, after usual pantomimic fashion. Whoever isn't jolly seen this day, 'Twill be the worse for him, that's all I say. [Returns to table—Tenantry crowd round him, some to pay their rents, some to solicit indulgence. Enter Mother Hubbard and her Dog. Mother H. When such the steward, let the tenants heed; Where'er he presses, he's too hard indeed. Gryppe. [At table.] There's two and three are five, and four are nine; You've got your change: now, then, to count up mine. Mother H. You soon will see some change that will surprise you. Gryppe. Now off, and come back merry, I'd advise you. Our new young 'Squire will generously defray All the expenses—[Aside.] which you'll have to pay. At one o'clock the revel will commence;— Here are receipts for all who have paid their rents. [Music.—Tenantry disperse, leaving Mother Hubbard, Dog, and Steward. Gryppe. How is't, old witch, of whom we've been in quest, You didn't pay the same time as the rest? Mother H. I owe you nothing till next quarter's due. Gryppe. Have you paid your Dog-tax? Mother H. Humph! what's that to you? He isn't six months old—he's quite a pup. Look at his teeth— Gryppe. I will, and have you up. [Music.—Gryppe proceeds to examine the Dog's mouth, gets snapped at, tries again, and is seized behind—he runs off, and the Dog after him. Mother H. Ha, ha!—Now, then, for Jack: he comes this way, And looking sad, poor boy! Enter Jack. Jack. [Downcast.] Ah! Dame, good day! I hear bad tidings from our village friends, On whom ill luck, 'twould seem, this year attends. There's many a man, I know, that hour will rue, The present 'Squire became their landlord, too. Mother H. [Aside.] I know his heart, but yet will try him more. To Jack. Ah! Jack, indeed that loss we all deplore. Alas! even I must quit, in my old age, The cottage where through life I've past each stage. P'raps sell my poor old dog to pay my rent, To save my goods being to the sheriff sent. Jack. No, no, good mother, not whilst I can work. For you, there's no employment I would shirk. I have health and strength—all's your's that I may earn; In the mean while, this trifle do not spurn, [Gives purse. It is but small, but, though it worth may lack, 'Twill prove at least you've got a friend in Jack. Mother H. [Aside.] The darling boy! [To Jack.] Your hand—aha! what's here? Your path through life I see extremely clear. This line upon your palm of fortune tells, You'll be yourself the heaviest of swells, Have a nice house, a farm, with cash beside, And have the girl you love to be your bride. Nay, you may stare, but there the lines all are, You are born under a most lucky star. Jack. Can this be true? Mother H. Before the morn shall break, You'll see Dame Hubbard has made no mistake. The heir of Rookwood comes—let us retire; On different grounds we'll meet this gay young 'Squire. [Music.—They go off. Enter 'Squire Rookwood, accompanied by his London Tailor, and Bootmaker, with their bills. 'Squire. Call this a coat! look here, the thing don't fit me! It wouldn't suit a finger-post, sir; split me! [To Bootmaker.] And as for these! d'ye call these London made? Off and consider you're with this well paid. [Bootmaker is propelled by the article of his own manufacture off stage, with Tailor. So. I suppose this is the village-green, Where, in my honour, will the sports be seen. Who have we here? I see—with garlands laden, Comes tripping forth each blooming village maiden. Music—Enter Village Lasses, with garlands, which they use in decorating Ale-house porch, &amp;c.—'Squire seizes two Girls round the waist, and kisses them. Don't be alarmed! this is our mode in town, The latest fashion which I've just brought down. I am your new protector, your young 'Squire, Lord of the Manor, which is half the shire. So, from my manner, don't get shier of me— That's rather witty—ha, ha, ha! he, he! [They retire up. Enter Rosetta, with milking pail. Another! Ha! my little rustic beauty, I'll teach these bumpkins here to know their duty. [Singing affectedly. Where are you going to, my pretty maid? Rosetta. Going a milking, sir— 'Squire. She said. Shall I go with you, my pretty maid? Rosetta. No, if you please, kind sir— 'Squire. She said. Squire. Then I cannot marry you, my pretty maid. Rosetta. Nobody axed you— 'Squire. So she said, &amp;c. [Rosetta is going off, when 'Squire detains her forcibly. But stay! haw-haw! I feel in this direction, A sort of haw-haw! what d'ye call't? affection. You must be mine—nay, girl, I'll have a kiss, Resistance is in vain!—hollo! what's this? Enter Jack, to the rescue, and confronts him. Jack. Come, 'Squire, from such attentions please refrain. 'Squire. There! I declare! that vagabond again! You rascal, in those torn and tattered clothes, Where you will go to do you e'er suppose? Jack. I aren't a going to see my sweetheart kissed. 'Squire. Oh! we'll soon settle that, if you insist. What ho! within there! Two Constables appear, from Ale-house. [Giving signet ring.] Fellows, there's my gage, Lock up this wagged wagrant in the cage. Jack. But, 'Squire! Rosetta. Oh goodness! 'Squire. Mind he don't get free— Off to the Round-house, and bring me the key! [Music.—Jack is hurried off by Constables. Aha! these rustics I must teach their place. Now, then, my beauty, you our revels grace. [Leads Rosetta reluctantly to the back. Marked Music.—Loud peal of bells heard—Tenantry and Villagers enter, Old Gryppe, the Steward, and his Wife.—Barrels of Beer rolled forth by Host—table spread with eatables, &amp;c., and an imitative Tableau is formed of Frith's Picture ‘Coming of Age in the Olden Time.’—'Squire gets on chair for speech. 'Squire. My friends! to-day I come of age. Voices. Hear, hear! 'Squire. On which account you will have lots of beer. Voices. [Shouting.] Hoorah! 'Squire. My worthy Steward has received instructions, From all your rents to make immense deductions. [Shouts renewed. For, as they will be doubled, I'm assured, This great reduction I can well afford. [Sensation. Should any of you find you want repairs, Such as a little painting up the stairs; Or if you've got a tile off, which may be, Apply to him— Voices. Hoorah! 'Squire. And don't you bother me. ['Squire descends from chair. Constables enter, Melodramatically, and deliver key to 'Squire, which he places in his vest. The key! then he is safe at all events; Ring out the bells, and let the sports commence. Roll forth the barrels—drink whoe'er is dry— [Aside.] It's you who'll have to pay for it, not I. Peal of Bells resumed, while they are getting ready—The Sports begin with the dance of Sir Roger de Coverley, in which 'Squire leads off Rosetta, who dances with reluctance, and taking an opportunity to change partners, dances off, unobserved by the 'Squire—Ale brought out in barrels, and drank largely.—Procession of Mummers, in which figure Robin Hood, Little John, Valentine and Orson, St. George and the Dragon, the Stilt Walkers, Bear and his Keeper, Morris Dancers, Mother Goose, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.—they pass along the stage so as to show their various characters, and a busy scene is kept up, till Mother Hubbard and Dog enter at side, when there's a general pause for refreshment. Mother H. Hist! seize him lad! find out where lies the key! Off with it then, good Dog, and bring it me! [Melodramatic Music.—Dog carefully watches an opportunity, then flies at 'Squire's neck, and a desperate struggle ensues as in the pieces belonging to the dog-days of the Minor Drama.—'Squire at last thrown on the ground, Dogs gets the key, which he bears off in triumph in his mouth, upsetting Villagers, &amp;c. &amp;c., in his progress, who commence an exciting chase, which is kept up till change of scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IV. —THE COMMON, AND DISTANT COUNTRY. Sunset.—On one side, the Cage, in which Jack is seen, imprisoned. Jack. Whilst with the revels now they're in the prime of it, I'm all alone, and have a dreary time of it. I'll try and sleep a dull half hour away. What! build a house! Oh, likely—I dare say. [Incredulously composes himself to sleep, after trying strength of bars, &amp;c. Enter Mother Hubbard, with Key. Mother H. Behold! in this parochial institution, The victim of unmerited persecution. How small he looks. I've not the slightest doubt, He'll look much larger when I let him out. [Growing sentimental. If I take this strong tea, I see I shall Be getting quite an old Bohea-mian gal. MEDLEY SCENA, Mother Hubbard.—Air, ‘You'll remember me. When other lips and other hearts, Which you all know so well, In language which soft soap imparts, Some tales of me shall tell; When children who have done their task, Some fun would like to see, In such a moment I but ask, That you'll remember me. Air, ‘Down Derry Down.’ Why, my poor little Jack, I should like to know what You have done, to be served in a way you should not? Quite out of the common this roundhouse should be, But, though, out of the common it isn't, we see. Down, down, don't be cast down. Recitative. I'll free you from this cage as 'twere a wicker un'; But that air runs too slow, I'll try a quicker un'. Air, ‘Drops of Brandy.’ I'm a witch, of a comical sort, My dog, too, a wizard, I'm sure, is; He's one who makes capital sport In the pages of nursery stories. He's ready for frolic and fun, And he'll never for plenty of room stick; When folks try and catch him, it's one, Two, three, and off on my broomstick. Rum you may think my timidity, But I have eyes open wide, O! None, though 'twas seized with rapidity, Jumped when he hid it as I do, Air, ‘The Triumph,’ Country Dance. And now, as you might like to see a little hanky-panky, I will show a trick or two before I go; Here you have a pack of cards—take any of 'em—thank'ee; Return it to the pack again, and shuffle them up, so. Hixtum stixtum—see, I've mixed 'em; Popalorum, cockalorum, jig o' me, ah ha! Jack of hearts, sir—you may start, sir, But that's your card, and that is what you are! With my tiddy-iddy, chickabiddy, fol de rol de rido. Grand Pas de Broomstick. Mother H. What Mother Hubbard says, she sticks to, boy; Let fancy form the dreams that you enjoy. First Figure, a Mason, passes. Here is the Mason figured forth, you see, ‘Free and accepted’ here he's sure to be. Second Figure, of Drain Pipes, enters. Great Pan, with all his pipes, with might and main, Reveal the way the builders do a drain. Third Figure, a Carpenter, enters. The Carpenter, who works by rule—he's good in Carp-entertainments, a la Toole and Wood-in. Fourth Figure, the Hodman, enters. Here's the Hodman, by way of a variety, A member of the hod-fellows' society. Fifth, a loose Brick enters. And here you see a loose one, though a true brick. He's no rude alteration of the ru brick. These in your dreams are fancy's ideality, Now you shall have your house built in reality. [Figures disappear. Your prison's locked, but free this key shall make it; Now, when you see your house at day-break, take it. Mother Hubbard strikes her staff on the stage, and the Cage, with Jack, is covered with a cloud, which, when withdrawn, shows a crowd of little Labourers, waiting to begin.—Scaffold-poles, barrows, ladders, &amp;c., are brought on—the scaffold is speedily seen raised—a busy throng of pigmy Carpenters, Paper-Hangers, Whitewashers, &amp;c., rush on—the House is rapidly built—when finished, the Union-Jack flies from the chimney, and the usual distribution of beer takes place, with great cheering—smoke from chimney—the Malt is seen stored in Granary on one side—Dairy on the other,—Day breaks. Mother H. Come, Jack, and take your house—it's all your own; Within a single night behold it grown. Recitative. This is the Malt that lay in the house that Jack built. Rat appears. This is the Rat that ate the Malt that lay in the house that Jack built. Dame Trot's Cat appears, and puts an end to Rat. This is the Cat that killed the Rat, &amp;c. Mother Hubbard's Dog appears. This is the Dog that worried the Cat, &amp;c. The Cow appears at Dairy, and tosses Dog. This is the Cow with the crumpled horn, that tossed, &amp;c. Rosetta appears, and pacifies Cow. This is the Maiden, all forlorn, that milked the Cow, &amp;c. Jack kisses Rosetta. This is the Man, once tattered and torn, that kissed, &amp;c. Priest appears, and marries them. This is the Priest, all shaven and shorn, that married, &amp;c. The Cock appears. This is the Cock that crowed in the morn, that waked, &amp;c.

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE V. —FROG POOL, IN THE MARSHES. Hunting Music.—Cries of ‘Tallyho,’ &amp;c.—'Squire enters, in hunting costume, &amp;c. 'Squire. Tallyheigho! where are you, great and small? Tallyheigho! I've lost the fox and all. I'll sing a song—there's nobody desires it, But then the situation here requires it. SONG, 'Squire.—Air, ‘Old Towler.’ Though chant I clear cannot this morn, My throat's so husky found, I'll try what I can do to warn My followers off this ground. Dogs, huntsmen all, a joyful throng, Were going at full cry, When down a turning that was wrong, Away at once went I. [Shouting. With a heigh ho! chevy! Come forward, come forward—'taint if he Knew, oh chevy! Meant they some assistance should give me, Come forward, I know, you the horn ought to blow; Come forward, I know, you're confoundedly slow! With a heigh ho, chevy, heigh ho! oh-oh-oh-oh! &amp;c. I really hope you wont be long, Or 'mongst the flags I lie, Amongst the flags—oh my! Ah! it's no use! this shouting's all in vain; And this eye—oh! sees nothing, once again. Each step I take goes further in a bog— Hollo! what's that? uncommon like a frog. Frogs appear in succession. And here another—and another, too— Another still succeeds—stop, that will do. Another yet—and, lo! a sixth appears— I do begin to have un-'Squirelike fears; I'm much afraid, since this dark place I'm brought to, I haven't been so good, quite, as I ought to. [Light appears. Oh, dear! what lights are round about me flying? To find the road back now, it's no use trying. Why did I hunt at all? why, why endeavour— I'm getting further in the slosh than ever. Oh! here's a plight—I do repent me much— I'm a great rascal, I've behaved as such. I can't remember now one virtuous action; I caught a vagrant, that's a satisfaction, And put him in the cage—'twas justice nerved it; But, then, I'm not quite sure that he deserved it. Hollo! these frogs are climbing all about— I'm in a pretty mess—who'll help me out? Music.—Will-o'-the-Wisp appears. Will. I will, if you indeed repent your way? 'Squire. I truly do—the one I took to-day. Will. I mean, if you are really and sincerely Ashamed of all you have done? 'Squire. I am, most clearly. But tell me, please, to whom I am indebted For asking me how much I have regretted? Will. I'll tell you in a song. 'Squire. Ah! I tried singing; I sung out loudly, but no aid 'twas bringing. [Song, Will-o'-the-Wisp.—Composed by J. H. Tully. I'm Will-o'-the-Wisp, who leads astray Travellers, till they lose their way. Wherever my light is seen, beware, For danger then is lurking there. Glancing dark eyes seem to be, Harmless beams enough to see, But under those long dark lashes lie Will-o'-the-Wisp's own witchery. I'm Will-o'-the-Wisp, who lures by night, Mortals with my flickering light; In every shape you see me come, To lead the wanderer far from home. But of all my forms, there's one I'll tell, That never fails to serve me well,— Beware the light of a love-lit eye, It is Will-o'-the-Wisp's own witchery. 'Squire. Will-o'-the-Wisp you are, then? Will. You are right. I'm always seen about these fens at night. 'Squire. I see—if fenny folks your aid require, You come to light them home: that I admire. In fact, I've come to add-mire at every movement. Ad-miring you is really an improvement. Will. No jesting, sir; to get out of this bog You'll have to be indebted to a dog. 'Squire. At such a thing a man should not demur, We never know what's going to a cur. Will. Come hither, lad! [Whistles. 'Squire. He seems to know his name. Will. It's Mother Hubbard's Dog—you've seen the same. [At this intelligence the 'Squire is making off—he is met by the Dog.— Comic Business.—'Squire solicits pardon on his knees—Dog grants it, and blesses him.—Will-o'-the-Wisp beckons him away, and 'Squire is then led off by Dog, and followed by the Frogs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VI. —THE BULLRUSH SWAMP. The Dog enters, pulling in 'Squire, as in last scene, and pursued by Will-o'-the-Wisp. Will. Now, ere you further go, it's understood You do repent? 'Squire. I do—I will be good. Will. That, in atonement for all past offences, Jack shall inherit— 'Squire. All! though that immense is. Will. Then, at this bullrush swamp, you sign this deed; Here, take this reed to write—all right, now read. [Will-o'-the-Wisp plucks bullrush for pen—'Squire signs paper Enter Jack and Mother Hubbard. Will. Enough! Here's Jack, and Mother Hubbard, too, The future 'Squire we shall behold in you. All is attained. Mother H. I knew I should outlive him. However, the young rascal, I forgive him. [Shakes hands with 'Squire. Will. I will redeem my promise—from this track The shortest cut shall take the travellers back. Appear, my Fairy Sisters of the Glen. To ‘Elfin Land’ I change this swamp and fen. [Change to</field>
