      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE Design'd for Mr. Betterton, Spoken by Mr. Wilks. Melpomene no more erects her Head, Without her Comic Sister's chearful aid, To Night th'Amphibious Author Laughs and Mourns, And hopes you to will Sigh and Smile by turns: Apollo thus, the Poets radiant God, Now Shines, now Veils his Lustre in a Cloud. He aims to follow moving Oatway's Muse, But with unequal Steps the Glorious Bard pursues; Yet if that Painter merits some success Who strives from Titian or Vandyke to please, Our Author hopes his Pardon may be had, A Copy from that Master faintly made, Proves not his Judgment, but his Genius bad. For Oatway's sake his Young Disciple spare, Indulge the tender Plant with Friendly Care, Give him but kindly Soil, and let him spread, He'll live to pay you with a grateful Shade; Guard him from Critic Winds, One Hissing blast Blights and lays all his budding Verses waste. But if no Prayers your rigid Censures move, He flies for Refuge to the Court of Love; Yes, to that brilliant Circle he appeals, Where Heavenly Mercy with bright Beauty dwells: When you approve, they dare not disobey; The Victors here confess your Magic sway: Each Hero tears the Laurel from his Brows, And at his Charmers feet the bleeding Trophy throws: The hardy Soldier feels new Pains arise, Not from the Wounds of Swords—but pointed Eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE Spoke by Mrs. BICKNELL. These Tragic Writers do so fill their Plays With Virtue, and what was in former Days; The World is chang'd, and now the Lover throws To each believing Fair his common Vows: Troth 'twill be very hard, if civil Words That fly in Gallantry, are made Records Of Perjury; and punish'd thus with Swords: How many pretty Fellows here wou'd Dye! Dye for an Oath, a Senslless Perjury! Ah! that unthinking Virgin much deceives Her self, who in this Bankrupt Age believes; She ought to know all Vows are Words of course, Except that One, For Better and for Worse: By this Advice no Fair one e'er Miscarry'd, Or was forsaken; 'till she first was Marry'd. 'Tis a mistake Messieurs, for broken Vows, The Lover is not punish'd, but the Spouse, A Husband once, He doubly pays his Wife, For all the Errors of a single Life. [Is going off but Returns. But hold, I promis'd Bays I'd something say, To moderate your Censure of his Play: Heroically You Gentlemen Impannell'd in the Pit, Heroically You Sovereign Judges both of Sense and Wit. Hang it, this serious Speech I cannot bear, I was not made for Tragedy I'll Swear: Do as you Please, or Save, or Damn the Man; For so ye will—let me say what I can.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Enter Lothario and Anselmo at opposite Doors. Ans. Dear Partner of my Cares, for that's a Name Proper to Friendship; may each Day like this, Each rising Sun, behold our Hearts united; Oh may we never wrong that sacred Tye, That Simpathy of Souls, may it endure, As that eternal Truth which first inspir'd it. Loth. And when our weary Natures seek Repose, When surfieted with the same tedious Course, Our Spirits shake these grosser Burthens off. Then may our Souls take their glad Flight together To Empireal Joys and thinner Skies. Ans. United thus, thus fortify'd Lothario, Our Lives as gentle Streams shall glide away, While undisturb'd by Cares, we will deceive, The most malignant Influence of our Stars. Loth. Yet say Anselmo, tell me, did thy Heart, Never receive Impressions from the Fair? Howe'er thy solid Reason might shake off The soft bewitching Temper, have thy Eyes Like faithful Mirrors still Return'd the Beams Shot from Inchanting Women? Have those Orbs, Imbib'd the Light alone without the heat? Oh my Anselmo! I Confess the weakness I own that with unusual Warmth inspir'd, My Eyes beheld with pleasing pain the Fair, But Reason, Conquer'd, the Unkindly Gleam Just shot it's Fires, which warm'd alone and Fled. Ansel. Too long I've trifled with that Tyrant Passion, How often have I taught my untouch'd Heart Imaginary Pain, Protested, Vow'd, And Dy'd for every Charming Face I saw, If the too Credulous Fair with pity mov'd, Receiv'd her Votary; Oh my Lothario! I own 'twas much a Fault,—She was undone If with a wise Distrust she shun'd the Bait, 'Twas an Amuzement for an Idle Hour, But I am wounded, I have Caught my Friend The Passion I derided—Oh! I Love! The Hypochrite is paid for his False Zeal, And is become a Bigot from an Atheist. Loth. You do but justly feel those Pains you gave, That Laughing Deity which once you held, The Child alone of Idleness, and Ease, Has gloriously avow'd in you his Power. Ans. Yes he has taken ample Satisfaction For broken Vows, and Counterfieted Sighs, I Love Lothario, to that Mad degree, That Absence which I now am forc'd t'endure, Brings doubting Tortures, Misery, Dispair, Loth. Who is the Mistress of these Conquering Charms That fixt the wanderer, Anselmo's Heart; A little Cruelty you may allow her, It is a Justice which she owes her Sex. Ans. She is all soft her Nature knows no Rigor, No Coy Affected Arts, no practis'd Glosses The wiles her Sex are fond of and Admire, Sully the Native Beauties of her Mind, Her Duty only seems to Check her Passion, Her Duty which forbids her to be mine, For Oh Lothario! she is Leonato's, He is the Father of this mighty Treasure. Loth. That is Severe indeed Your Families Too well his known have for some Ages vow'd A Constant and Hereditary Hate. Why would you Cherish this unlucky Passion? Why give it Root and Norishment Anselmo? Banish it still, let absence, or Employment Arms or another loved Idæa Drown it, Forget her, be your self again and easie. Ansel. Forget her, Ah the crouding Images Chase one another in my troubled Thoughts, Ten thousand Stratagems I Form and Break, My very Dreams are buisily in Love. Loth. Shou'd She consent with equal Transport joyn Her Faith her Virgin Piety must bleed; She comes all Sully'd to her Husbands Arms Charg'd with Parental Curses on her Head. Ans. Plague me not now with Reason 'tis all tastless 'Tis Nonsence to a wretch in burning Pain To talk of Stoic Wisdom; Aid me Sir 'Tis what I may Command in Friendship's Name For I have laid the Scheme by thee to reach her. Loth. I find you are a Lover, therefore Thought, I might presume was grown a Stranger to you, However let me know what Task I have And you shall find no Danger can Deter From Acting for my Honor, and my Friend, What my Anselmo Reasonless can ask. Ansel. You then shall Court her for me, you are lov'd And valued by her Father Leonato, I oft have heard you say with what Respect, With more than common Courtesie he sees you, Propose to Wed my Mistress; ask her of him, Your Fortune, and your Family deserve her, With Joy he will Recieve you, then my Friend May double all my Bliss, talk to her, tell her With what uncommon Purity I Worship: At least you are so much my self, your Heart By Sympathethic Fire will talk like mine. Loth. Iv'e heard what you propose, were it alone As 'tis a Dangerous, an unpleasant Office; Credit me, Friend, I would with Joy perform it. Yet sure Anselmo must Consult my Honour, It hardly can be fit I should Decieve With false delusive Terms of a feign'd Courtship, The generous Leonato's open Heart. Ansel. Oh both the Families with grateful Joy Will own the mutual Blessing, Leonato When Time shall molifie his rigorous Hate, He shall confess the Benefit like me, He too shall own that Vertue must be great, That Freindship must be sacred that can cure By such uncommon Means an ancient Wound, And seal in ever living Love the Blessing. Loth. You shall not say you ask'd Lothario ought And gave your Reasons for't and was refus'd, I will attempt it; tho' I fear in vain. Ansel. With Joy not to be told accept my Thanks My bright Ambassadour to Love's fair Court, You shall receive my Character, and bear My best Credentials to the fair Aspatia. My swelling Heart impatiently desires To see once more the Goddess of my Soul, Oh my Lothario when you once behold her, You shall confess her Beauty's magick Power, And own she might have been thy Conqueror. Not Cytherea when thro' Heaven she moves, Inspiring young Desires, and tender Loves, Inflames the youthful Gods with fiercer Joys, Or darts more killing Pleasures from her Eyes. SCENE changes to Leonato's House. Enter Aspatia and Julia. Jul. Yes, Man, Aspatia, is a fickle Creature, Inconstant as the Wind, by Passion sway'd, He loaths this Hour, what last he coveted, His Oaths, his Honour, his devoted Faith, Are all the Pandars of unchast Desire. Asp. Yet sure I've heard the Generous and Brave Are only sensible of Love and Honour. Jul. Oh! where two Hearts are equally inspir'd, Where mutual Love fans their alternate Flame, Where in harmonious Simpathy two Souls By Miracle unite, by Virtue fix, Virtue, the Basis of all solid Good, Loves an immortal Blessing from above, 'Tis then an Antepast of Bliss eternal; Society of Souls; and Nature here Confesses, she can give no greater Joy. Asp. You warm me, Julia, with this bright Idea, The counterfieted God is all Desire, This is Heroic Love, 'tis truly great. Jul. Yet each Deceiver wears this charming Dress, By this he does delude, by this betray, The fond, believing, Lovesick Virgin's Heart; —'Tis needless to repeat by what Degrees, How cautiously, with what well weigh'd Discretion, As I believ'd, I drew that Passion in, Which rob'd me of my Peace of Mind for ever, He was a Man form'd to deceive the Sex, Had every Grace makes Manly Beauty perfect, His Words commanded the still greedy Ear, As his too lovely Mien, and Shape the Eye, He knew with every Art to captivate, And lead the Sences willing Prisoners, But he was false, this Godlike Man was false, Sincerity was what he never knew, Yet, oh! he perfectly dissembled it. Asp. Why, Cousin, wou'd you never tell the Name Of this great, perjur'd, elegant, bad Man. Jul. Prepare the then to hear it, oh! prepare, Let it not shake thee, guard thy tender Heart For I have often seen him, lately too, Under thy Window, practising again With treacherous Arts, industrious to betray. Asp. He never cou'd have triumph'd there my Friend, And yet with what incessant Players and Tears, Eternal Services and vow'd Submissions, Such as might plead just Merit, if sincere, Has he endeavour'd to inspire my Soul With mutual Love— Jul. Ah with what Pleasure once I heard him sigh, When languishing and dying at my Feet, Too lavish of his perjur'd Breath, he vow'd, He shou'd with greater Pride expire my Slave, Then live sole Monarch of the Universe, Pity begot a kind of Tenderness That so much Worth shou'd suffer by my Rigour, That Tenderness warm'd into Friendships Name And Friendship quickly ripen'd into Love, Fond of the glorious Victim I receiv'd With Pride the new Adorer, till at last The Deity became the Sacrifice, Oh what a gallant Prize wou'd you have been, The Hopes of your great Family destroy'd, Its ancient Foe had triumph'd like a Victor, His counterfeited Love had gain'd a Conquest, His Sword with ill Success had oft essay'd. Asp. Yes, thou hast open'd a new Scene of Cunning, Brought to my unreflecting Memory; The Reason why his Toils with so much Art, With so much Care were spread; my Virgin Honour The House of Leonato so must pay The Vengeance of Hereditary Hate: Say—tell me—how shall I revenge my Wrongs, Thine and my Wrongs, Oh that he lov'd indeed, That with ten Thousand burning Scorpions Stings I might return the Wounds he gave with Interest. Julia. The Traitor durst not this Affront have offer'd, Had a Male Branch surviv'd; old Leonato, He thinks perhaps beneath his mighty Sword. Asp. Hymen said he shall heal this ancient Wound, We two the only Branch of either Root; Love shall inoculate, the differing Plants By mutual Benefits shall flourish long As mingling Streams we'll join, kindly unite, In soft embracing Ringlets ever run. Julia. Oh his mellifluous Tongue knows every Art, Knows every Wile is practis'd in Deceit. Asp. Methinks 'tis hard; the Combat is unequal, And Nature when she cloaths so false a Soul With such a God-like Form, creates a Foe Too strong for Virtue, naked, and unarm'd. Julia. Aspatia no, firm Virtue conquers all; Let your Eyes meet him next with cold Disdain, Let generous Indignation fire your Soul, And animate your Virtue to the Combat, Virtue's its own ineffable Reward, The Hero's Courage, and the Virgin's Guard. When loosen'd Winds furrow proud Neptune's Main, And ruffle to loud Storms his glassy Plain, The stedfast Rocks alone, unshaken bear, Conflicting Nature's Elemental War. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Enter Leonato and Sebastian. Leon. Honour Sebastian is a Virtuous Pride, It gilds too often with a gaudy Name The Rancour of a swoln, ill temper'd Mind; Show me a Wretch bending beneath the Load Of dire Adversity, beset with Want, Oblig'd from Hour to Hour, and Day to Day, To eke out a poor Life with borrow'd Bread, That treads no Earth, that breaths no Air his own, And quenches Nature's Heat with the cold Flood, Tho' sprung from God-like Race; tho' you derive His Stem from Hercules, you'll find this Honour Is flat, insipid, tastless to his Sense. As high fed Coursers, hot and full of Pride We know no Reins, but in low Pasture, dull, We jade, we feel the Whip and Spur in vain; Such is our unattir'd Nature Sir, And so far we assimilate to Beasts. Seb. We are not then our selves, when the clog'd Soul Oppress'd by Want, or shook with a Disease, Bears heavily her toilsome Burthen, Flesh; And Honour then may be an empty Sound, The vitious Palate, not the Food is bad; Yet when the Mind resumes its pristine Force, Again 'tis sensible of Right and Wrong, Again 'tis fir'd with gallant, high Idæa's. I guess, my Lord, why you Philosophize, I find my Arm unactive in the Cause; My Sword is feeble, and attempts in vain To right my injur'd Sister Julia's Wrong. Leo. Mistake not Youth, I wou'd not tie your Sword, An idle Hatchment only to your Side: You have already fought this gay Deciever, Your Arm Victorious, blush'd with his best Blood; Enough is given to Honour, and to Julia, And what was Justice then, is Malice now: Leave this Vow-breaker to the Gods for Vengeance, It is their Right alone, tho' Man usurps it. Seb. With Pleasure all your Council I obey, Believe me, Sir, no filial Piety Can with more duteous Deference submit, For you have been doubly a Father to me, A Friend to my Misfortunes. Leo. No more of that— Some Benefits are over-paid with Praise; I like not the vain Ear that can be tickled With its own virtuous Acts; The Repetition to a generous Heart, Is tedious and uneasy. Enter Messenger. Mess. My Lord, Lothario begs Admittance to you. Leon. This Man, Sebastian, you must call your Friend Of Modern Italy, yet constant, brave, Such as our Ancestors old Rome records; When not enervated with Luxury And lawless Ease, she triumph'd o'er the World: This Morn he ask'd me as the dearest Pledge Of my Esteem, my Daughter, my Aspatia, I could not wish my Child a nobler Match, And if her tender Passions meet my Wishes; I shall be then deliver'd of a Load, A mighty Load of Care, a Woman's Honour. Seb. My Lord, Lothario, or I'm much deceiv'd, Is in sworn Bonds Anselmo's dearest Friend, 'Tis an Objection bears some Force to say, Such an Alliance may be inauspicious, And widen yet the Wound which bleeds too fresh. Leo. No my Sebastian, this Collateral Bond Shall be the Cement to unite us all; Love shall the kindly healing Balsome prove, To cure this strange Hereditary Hate, That rages against Nature, Reason, Law. Sebast. My Lord, I take my Leave; may ev'ry Blessing O'ertake your own most forward happy Wishes. Enter Lothario. Loth. Impatient any longer to sustain The Sallies of a Passion nobly born: First let me kneel, and pay my Duty here; Excuse my Lord the Transport of a Joy, That breaks upon my Soul, from the near Hope Of being call'd your Son. Ah wou'd Aspatia Behold with equal Favour her Adorer; But I'm unpractis'd in those softer Arts, That win the Fair, and too too oft deceive, I can no Merit plead but your Command; The Parent may succeed, but not the Lover. Leon. Oh wou'd my Child Aspatia's Soul take Fire. As every Word, young Man, inflames my Heart; Thy Father's Image, great Lothario's Soul, My Godlike Friend seems all reviv'd in thee; I love thee Boy, I cannot tell thee more, And less I must not; nor will I longer stay thee From what thy Soul impatiently desires. [Exeunt. SCENE changes Enter Aspatia and Leucippe. Asp. He comes, Leucippe, now Lothario comes, To plead the Cause of Love, and steal my Freedom, Farewel ye pleasing Hours of Joy serene, Harmonious ever tuneful Virgin Days, The Marriage Storm is near, and Man rough Man, Disturbs the peaceful Calm. [Exit Leucippe. Enter Lothario. Loth. I bring, bright Maid, the tender of a Heart, Pure, chast, and lasting as fair Vesta's Flame, And if Desert might speak, but what Desert Can Man to Heaven, and Heaven-born Beauty plead, —Anselmo, Madam—You have heard him sigh, Yes seen him often prostrate at your Feet, And I but weakly can discharge my Trust, Can give you but faint Images of him, His Eyes alone are able to perswade, And tell the gnawing Fire, that burns within, But his own Words will do him ampler Justice. [Gives a Letter. Asp. This is uncommon Galantry, to woo By Proxy, court me by Ambassadour: Yet your Credentials prove you much in Trust. Loth. A weighty Trust indeed, for ah! what Heart, Unmov'd, unwarm'd, can stand the beauteous Shock, He must be more than Mortal who can guard, Gainst your victorious Charms, the Theme thus warms me To think how poor Anselmo sighs thy Absence, See, says the Youth where on a Bed of Flowers, The fair Aspatia lies, like Paphos Queen, Ten Thousand little Cupids fly around In circling Jollity, the Feather'd Loves Drink rich, Nectarious Cordials from her Eyes, And when she breaths, soft gentle Zephyrs wait, To suck the Spicy Odors as they fall. Asp. Anselmo chose a graceful Orator, Yet while you paint Anselmo's Flame so warmly, While you describe a Passion not your own, While your bold Pencil with dissembled Fires Deceives the distant Sight; I sigh to think A Time may come, when this gay Flow'ry Prospect, Of Vales and Rivers, Meads and Rural Seats, Drawn closer to the Eye, must all appear, The Pencil's Creatures only, Paint and Oil; Varnish of empty Words,—and gilded Air. Loth. Your Beauty must create an Orator, Which while it warms the Heart inspires the Tongue, The Syllables must elegantly flow, In decent Order, Advocates of Love; Who can dissemble, who can counterfiet, The tender Breathings of a Lover's Mind, Thus if Anselmo writes, or talks, or thinks, Aspatia still creates the charming Theme, The Trees all speak his Passion, while that Word Appears in Cyphers on the wounded Bark, The Groves repeat it, and the mimick Nymph Is weary with resounding his Aspatia, Say shall there be a Time—Or has he leave To hope, you will indulge him with a Smile? Asp. Lovers Cameleon like are fed on Air, And Hopes the Food of Love, that general Good I neither can deny, nor grant Anselmo, But oh! Lothario like a pointed Sword, My Father's Curse now pendent o'er my Head, Deters me from indulging his least Wish. Yet tell him I approve his Conduct, thus To treat by Proxy; tell him your Admittance Was easie, and your Presence grateful here. Asid. Hah, whether am I going, every Word, Asid. Each piercing Look, darts thro' and thro' my Soul. Loth. I fly, fair lovely Maid, to your Anselmo, And pour the Balsam in his bleeding Wound, Thrice happy Maid, who only can deserve What only you can give, that Heav'n of Beauty. Asp. Beauty corrupts like Summer Fruit Lothario, Virtue alone with everlasting Lustre, As a fine Diamond shines tho' coursly set, The warmest Bigot at bright Beauty's Shrine, Turns Atheist as the blooming Flower decays. Loth. Aside. Gods how she fires my Soul, my Traitor Tongue Wou'd utter what my Heart ought not to think A Leaden Damp hangs like a Cloud upon me, As if I mourn'd my too successful Friend. Asp. Thus Nature curious in the Body's Form, Too oft neglects the Texture of the Mind, While the fine breathing Picture strikes the Eye, The thoughtless Image but confirms the Ear, The thing was made for Ornament not Use. Loth. But when they meet, where Beauty blending joins With Virtue, who can bear the dazling Light? Vice blushes struck with awful Reverence, And Virtue shines aided with double Beams, And borrow'd Blaze from her Aspatia's Eyes; Yet let me pay my Duty to Anselmo, Tell him the glorious Conquest I have made, And ease with the glad News his beating Heart. [Exit. Asp. alone] The Conquest thou hast gain'd is all thy own, Ah, wherefore dost thou sue for false Anselmo, My little panting Heart proclaims Lothario, And all my Rebel Senses aid the Choice, Yes let him reign: But Honour, rigid Honour, Throws in a fatal Bar, and cuts the Prospect, Tho' he should love like me, tho' all his Passion Well painted as it is, his speaking Eyes, And melting Eloquence, were real all, Yet he's Anselmo's Friend, their blended Souls By a long Intercourse of mutual Benefits, Are bound with Ligaments too sinuous, For Love or weak Aspatia to disolve, Oh! Love thou cruel Tyrant of the Soul, Direct thy Captive thro' this winding Maze. [Exit. SCENE changes. Enter Lothario. Loth. No were she fairer than her Mother Venus, As sure she bears the brightest Mortal Form, Yet my firm Soul shou'd stand the beauteous War, Without one Traitor Thought, tho' my Heart bleeds, Virtue shall conquer all, yet why Anselmo Why didst thou give me this uncommon Tryal, Aspatia's Charms might well disarm and fire, The coldest Virtue, make a Stoic burn, I feel, I feel her here, conflicting Beauty Strugles within for Universal Empire. Enter Anselmo. Ans. Welcome thou worthy Messenger of Love, What says the Fair, repeat her very Words, That I may take my Hopes and my Dispair From my own jealous Censure, thou art kind, And wilt incline to heighten or indulge My Lovesick Wishes; speak in'attentive Ear, Will as you breath 'em catch the flying Sounds. Loth. She bids you hope, that general Food of Love She neither can deny, nor grant Anselmo, Tho' like a pointed Sword her Father's Curse Is pendent o'er her Head, she much approves Your Conduct in this Case to treat by Proxy. Ans. She gives me Hope, Hope is the Beggar's Comfort, The Food of Gally Slaves, deceitful View, That spins out Misery, and binds to Life Ev'n the most Wretched; no, 'tis all a Cheat, My Love's too Masculine to feed on Air. What my Aspatia then, must a lean Hope Be the Reward of all my faithful Hours. Loth. Ah blame not fair Aspatia, sure she Loves, I read her Eyes, which spoke in kinder Terms, Than what her Virgin Modesty cou'd utter: Joy sat triumphant in those living Lights, And both were Advocates with me for you. Ans. Let me then hope, you must excuse my Fears, Tumultuous Passion shakes the Lover's Breast; He forms his Frights as Children in the Dark, Ten Thousand wild Illusions break his Rest; But tell me Sir, is she not worth his Care. Loth. Is she not forming Nature's lovely Pride, Sweet as the vernal Breese, chast as the Flood, And when she speaks th'Angelic Charmer Strikes, The ravish'd Sences with such various Harmony, Our Eyes, our greedy Ears devour the Banquet; Thus every Sense is Captive made to Love. Ans. You must repeat this Visit, my Lothario, Then urge the present Opportunity, Propose our Marriage, fix the happy Hour. Loth. I wish some other Means— Ans. No more, your Word's recorded; 'tis a Trust; This is a Trial for a perfect Friend. Friendship is greatly prov'd by adverse Fate, When it endures hard Fortune's ordeal Heat. In fierce Vulcano's Chymists thus explore, And purge from drossy Particles their Oar; The yellow God, tho' ripen'd by the Sun, Proves his Divinity in Fire alone. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter Aspatia and Julia. Julia. Wherefore these downcast Eyes, these frequent Sighs, Now thy pale Cheeks confess thy conscious Flame, And now the flushing Blood o'erspreads thy Face, So rising Phœbus gilds with dawning Light The Lillies of the Vale— Thy Tell-tale Eyes, the rising Breath that swells Those snowy Orbs, these Tears of pearly Dew, That Drop by Drop, steal from thy languid Eyes, Silently speak the Passion of thy Soul— Asp. If ardent Virtue, if a Form Divine, If Eloquence can move, if Love has Force To conquer Reason, Education, Law, Why shou'd I blush to own Lothario's Charms: Yes, let me ease my labouring Lovesick Mind, Confess my Passion, and implore thy Aid; 'Tis for Lothario that I Sigh, I Weep, That Godlike Youth is all my Wish, my Care, The Business of my Life. Ah Julia help, Advise, compassionate thy Lovesick Friend. Julia. Thrice happy Maid, the tender God of Love Propitious to thy Wishes helps the Flame: Hymen Attends to crown the circling Joy, And Leonato gives a Blessing Hand. Asp. He never can be mine: No, Julia, no, Friendship forbids the Banes, that sacred Word Has broke our distant Hope, and dash'd the Joy; With painted Flames I burn. Jul. Lothario then is but Anselmo's Proxy, And while he blinds your Father with a Tale, Of honourable Love, to you he speaks In his Friends Name, Loves Powerful Advocate. Asp. This Morn he spoke his Friend in Terms Divine, Yet then his leaden Heart and his dull Eyes Declar'd the mighty Weight that press'd his Soul At Noon again he paid his Solemn Vows, For his Anselmo, faithful to his Trust. But then as Fire confin'd or Floods restrein'd His Passion knew no Bounds: Prostrate he Fell, And dying at my Feet reveal'd his Flame, I Gently rais'd him, pleas'd to find him mine; And ah my Julia Own'd (as from my Eyes He might have learnt before) a Mutual Ardor, And yet tho' Love awaits with Purple Wings To Fan the Gentle heat himself has rais'd Friendship; cold Honour with superior Energy Damps our alternate Joy, kind, cruel, Boy, Bright Cytherea's Son, or cure Anselmo, Or heal the poor, despairing, lost Aspatia. Jul. Restless fatigu'd with Pain, you banish Thought, And exile Reason shuns your dangerous Passion, So wounded by the Hunters flying Steel, The panting Stag ranges the Woods, the Fields, Then seeks the Flood, the fatal Arrow fix'd Grows to his Wound, his groaning Bosom heaves, He sighs, he weeps, languishing Life away, —Reason alone, Reason's unerring Force Must cure a Hurt like this, maturely weigh, Cooly reflect, when Passion bates, and Thought Alternately resumes her ruffl'd Seat. Asp. So Winds and Show'rs encrease the growing Flame So Feaverish Heats augment by cooling Draughts, Go talk to the poor Lunatic of Thought, Bid him recall his Reason to his Aid; Ah thou fond Girl, know'st thou the Power of Love, Cou'd thy soft tender Heart perceive his Fires, Receive the tender God, and stand confess'd, His lowliest Slave, and canst thou speak of Thought, Reflection, Reason, solemn Mockery Of Priests and Pedants, no the sprightly Boy Disdains all Limit, knows no Rule or Reign Boundless as Thought, as Elemental Fire. Jul. Even thus we catch Diseases at the Eyes, And look away our downy Peace and Reason, This Morn Aspatia cou'd with Pleasure hear, Of Falshood, broken Vows, and perjur'd Men, And pleas'd to think her happy Heart was free, Unhurt, despis'd his feeble Godships Bow And mock'd his Darts; but see Lothario comes, Farewel, may he be false, to false Anselmo, And of a perjur'd Freind, ye mighty Gods Make him a faithful Lover. [Exit Jul. Enter Lothario to Aspatia. Loth. I come fair lovely Maid to intercede, Thus on my Knees to ask, to beg a Boon, Which granted strikes to the cold Earth a Wretch, Yes the most wretched of his Race Lothario; And if refus'd, brands me with Traitor, Slave, Writes Villain in my Heart, and perjur'd Friend In sanguine Characters upon my Brow. Asp. If then I neither must refuse, nor grant, Let me be silent rather than offend, Yet if it be no Crime, you may disclose The dreadful Secret, tho' my Breast be full, Brimful of Care, to ease your loaden Heart, I'll take my equal Share of Friendly Grief. Loth. To ask you for Anselmo, for my Friend, He sighs, he pants, he bleeds for his Aspatia; The faithful Youth, constant as dying Martyrs, And firm as Saints to Virtue, is his Flame: By me he begs that you wou'd crown his Hopes, And let the sacred Priest for ever join you; Join both your Hands in Hymenæl Bonds, Long—long may Love and balmy Peace infold you, Incircling Life in never dying Joys; While I, whose Heart adores you with a Fire As pure, as lasting, and as bright as his, For ever doom'd to Earth, and cold Despair, Hopeless and wretched languish Life away, And never from that fatal Wedding more, Uplift my Eyes to Heav'n, or to Aspatia. Asp. If Love can make us wretched, 'tis where Love Meets with inexorable cold Disdain; I have confess'd, I have made known my Weakness; Lothario, plead no more for false Anselmo; Thou know'st this Heart is thine, devoted thine, Plead thy own happy Cause, successful Youth; Talk thou no more of wounded Hearts, Despair, And hopeless Love, for thy Aspatia loves; Let me with downcast Eyes blushing declare, Her Flame is mutual; may the friendly Lights Incorporate, and make a brighter Blaze. Loth. I own the guilty Pride that I receive, The unutterable Pleasure that I take, While you confess a mutual Flame for me; Yet conscious of the Wrong to my Anselmo, The new-born Joy is dash'd with bitter Gall; At first my lawless Eyes confess'd their Flame, And my weak Tongue but faintly spoke Anselmo; Thus has my Heart turn'd Rebel to my Honour; Oh! fair Aspatia, this confirms my Ruin, That you with mutual Passion love Lothario. Asp. Hear then illustrious Friend, thou pious Youth, Too nicely Jealous of thy spotless Honour, Know that Anselmo never cou'd be mine, His Wrongs to Julia arm'd my Virgin Heart, And caution'd me against that known Deceiver. Loth. The Plagues of Tantalus are senseless Tales, I feel ten Thousand living Furies here, The struggling Soul sustains unequal War, Here my Aspatia owns her tender Flame, And while my eager Arms wou'd clasp her close, And my Soul burns to taste that Heav'n of Joy, Behold grim Honour—like an injur'd Shade Stalks cross our meeting Hands; Judge me ye Gods; I feel Anselmo's Pangs, Participate his Grief, taste his Despair, And yet were he more happy, I must be Still hopeless—still a Wretch. Asp. Anselmo when he sees how widely distant His Hopes are born, will sacrifice to thee, His luckless Passion, and oblige his Friend By that great generous Act. Loth. And shall I wrong this great this generous Friend, The basest Thief is he who robs in Trust, What under Colour of fair Freindship's Name, To steal the dearest Treasure of his Soul; No more, th'op'ning Scene strikes my sick Mind With black Despair,—yes I will see my Heart, My loving lov'd Aspatia torn away, Torn from my dying Arms; speak then Aspatia—say, Wou't thou not pity poor Anselmo's Friend, Wou't thou not sigh or drop a Tear at parting? Canst thou behold me in the Pangs of Death, Rack'd with unutterable hopeless Grief; Wou't thou not say the over-bounteous Gods Ruin'd Lothario with their choichest Gifts, Gave him a faithful Friend, and touch'd the Heart Of his Aspatia with a mutual Flame, And yet his Frind and Mistress both were Curses. Asp. You probe too deep your wounded Mind Lothario, And my Heart bleeds to see yours torn with Thought, With self-tormenting Anguish; if the Gods, The righteous Gods, by interposing Hands, Prevent not in their Providence, I swear, To satisfy the mighty Debt you owe, To Honour and your Friend; I swear to give my Hand Where you shall guide it: Yes, I will be Anselmo's, Tho' Death is much more welcome, to appease The Tempest of your Mind, to satisfy The Passion of your Soul, and save your Friend. Loth. Great generous Maid, oh 'tis too much Aspatia, This vast Profusion, this Excess of Goodness; No, let us never part, let all be calm, Hence, hence perplexing Thought, Aspatia's mine, The circling Hours shall all be Peace and Joy, Fruit of conubial Innocence and Love. Asp. And shall not rigid Honour interpose; Your Friend I fear will blast these blooming Sweets. Loth. Why didst thou thus recall that dreadful Word, I swear my Love, cou'd I forget Anselmo; —But 'tis in vain—and I must part with all, Or sink a Wretch below the vilest Slave. —Didst thou not promise me to give thy Hand, And for my Sake alone to wed Anselmo; There is no other Way—Oh wou'd my Life, The parting of this brittle Soul and Frame, Pay down the Forfeit, I wou'd scorn to ask it, To save my Life alone, but 'tis my Fame, My Honour, and my House, yes I must stand A Villain on Record to future Times; Remorsless Fate—Ah rigid Powers supreme, That force us to be cruel to be Just. Asp. No more, compose your self, my Lord, 'tis done; Yet think, oh think by thy own wounded Soul, What Pangs Aspatia feels to part with thee. Loth. I will return to my unhappy Friend, And tell him he shall have your Hand to Morrow; Then let me give you to Anselmo's Arms With a relenting, swelling Heart discharge This strictest Bond of Faith— Oh Friendship, sacred Friendship now assist me. Asp. Oh violated Love; ah ruin'd Maid! Loth. Weep not my Love, my mangled Heart bleeds fresh At every Tear, and answers Drop for Drop; To Morrow dress thee for a Sacrifice, A tender Sacrifice of Love and Honour Give me thy Hand Aspatia, let me print One memorable Kiss—To Morrow's Dawn Parts us for ever— Asp. For ever—dire Distress—Can we not shun Our gloomy Fate; think, think in Time and save us, Ah my Lothario! Loth. It is not to be born; I dare not stay, Those pleading Eyes and Tears break my Resolves, And sink me down a Traitor: Love farewell, Think that to Morrow's Sun shall fix thy Name In Honour's brightest Roll, thrice virtuous Maid. [Exit Loth. Asp. sola.] He's gone, and I am bound by Oath to Morrow, To give my unwilling Hand to false Anselmo; Yet e'er the sacred Marriage Tapers burn, Snatch me some pitying Angel from the Altar; Ah how perverse were the malignant Stars That rul'd my Birth; my trembling Heart now fears Each Moments Flight, stop all ye Wheels of Time, Prevent the Dawn; ye swift Wing'd Minutes stay, Or thou bright Phœbus ne'er restore the Day The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Lothario and Aspatia. Loth. By that bless'd Sun who gilds the Rosy Morn, Thou art my Light and Heat, like that bright God When you appear, all Nature smiles around, —Yet we must part—inevitable Fate, And dire Necessity command it from us. Asp. Ah wherefore was I made to know your Worth, Why do you shine with such distinguish'd Rays, Illustrious in that Friendship that undoes me; Why did my Father fill my Virgin Heart, With glorious high Idæas of your Person, And wherefore do you more than answer all, My Thought conciev'd, my Fancy cou'd describe. Loth. To add more Weight to my o'er-loaden Heart, The Gods inspir'd thy tender Soul with Love, That I might feel thy Pangs, and tast thy Sorrows, Perhaps to tempt my Faith, and boasted Friendship, She Loves, and yet that Love augments my Anguish; Did ever Man receive a Blessing thus, Disastrous Stars! Behold Anselmo comes, My rival Friend, break, break my tortur'd Heart, Ye Gods, support my Love, preserve my Friend. Asp. My Rival comes, profusely kind to him Anselmo, he has all thy Heart, Aspatia Is offer'd up to heal your wounded Faith. Enter Anselmo. Ans. Thus the poor Slave benighted in a Dungeon, Percieves the friendly Light break thro' the Gloom; So Joyous his brisk Eyes, his cheary Heart, Welcome returning Day—Welcome Aspatia. —Ha! therefore are thy Eyes thus bent on Earth; Why sighs my Love—Is this our Marriage Day; She weeps, perhaps thy tender Virgin Heart Shrinks at the Change; say is it so Aspatia. Asp. I come not out of Choice, but by Command, Oblig'd by the severest, strictest Vow, That ever bound a dying, lovesick Maid, To offer you my Hand, my Heart Anselmo Can ne'er be thine. Ans. —Ten thousand thousand Horrours, Broke in those Words on my astonish'd Soul: What says Aspatia? Asp. My Heart can ne'er be thine, your Friend Lothario, Who hates to Death unfortunate Aspatia, Oblig'd me by a solemn guilty Oath That I wou'd wed you, take my promis'd Hand, And lead your bleeding Victim to the Altar. Ans. Guide me ye equal Gods, 'tis all amazement, All Wildness and Confusion shall I ask thee; Is then thy Heart a Stranger to my Love, Oh lead me thro' this Labyrinth of Error. Asp. I love Lothario to Distraction, Death, And as a Proof of my exalted Passion, I have consented thus to throw away, My Soul's eternal Peace, and sweet Repose; [Turning to Loth. Now execute thy own most dread Decree, And join those Hands whose Hearts can never meet. Asp. Is this Illusion all; the wild Ideas Of a distemper'd Brain? Or is it Truth, All pointed, murdering Truth? Oh! my Soul burns within me, eating Fire Consumes the Fabrick, tell the fatal Tale, Speak thou, Lothario, Truth demands thy Voice, Thou wert a Man, a Man of Honour once, Thus fix'd I'll stand, immoveable receive The keenest Bolts of Fate. Loth. Prepare thee yet to hear more dreadful Accents, Behold before thee the most criminal, Yet faultless Wretch, that e'er till now offended, Impute it to my Fate, my guilty Stars, I love Aspatia, yes I avow my Passion, As violent, as faithful, and as pure As thine. Ans. —Hah; Loth. Recall your Temper, be your self, resolve, And stand the mighty Shock. Ans. Tho' like a Sword each sharpen'd Syllable Strikes thro' and thro' my Heart, I'll hear thee calmly, Yes calm as Death or sleeping Innocence, Go on— Loth. Have we not from our Infancy injoy'd, The self same Appetites, the same Disgusts, The mutual Harmony in all but Love Strengthen'd our Freindship, Nature so resolv'd it, We were created Freinds, while the same Passions The same Affections, govern'd all our Habits, Oh! hard Necessity that first oblig'd you, To use me your Ambassador in Love, Mankind are all your Rivals in that Fair, Then tell me by that mutual Truth, Anselmo, Which still survives within me firm as Fate, Cou'd I whose Thoughts are Unisons to yours, Evade those Charms that had prevail'd on you. Ans. Confusion; whither wou'd the Sophist lead me: Does she not love? Do you not stand confess'd A Perjur'd— Asp. Lothario is the Centre of my Bliss, My Care, my utmost Wish, my Joy, my Peace. Loth. And thou art mine, witness ye sacred Beings, Guardians of spotless Truth, and Faith inviolate, Behold a breaking Heart, a dying Lover Bleeds at your Altars—Give me thy Hand, Aspatia, Take—take her, Sir,—yet hold—one parting Kiss, Oh! Taste of Joys immortal—pardon Anselmo, 'Tis thus I bid adieu to Life and Love, Both which I part with to my dearest Freind. Asp. to Loth. Thou canst not mean this cruel and unkind, I feel my female Fears, my Coward Heart Trembles and dares not stand this horrid shock. Loth. Eternal Happiness and Joy surround you, Prythee be very tender of thy Love, That sweet Content may bless your peaceful Hours, So if Lothario's Stars had shined auspicious, Shou'd he have pass'd a Life of Love like you, And mayest thou, sweet Aspatia, never want, The Blessings, thou alone canst give Anselmo. Asp. I must for ever want 'em, oh! farewel To Joy, to Peace, to Happiness and Love. Ans. You mock me with a Mistress and a Friend, And both are false as Hell, you give her Hand And hold her Heart in Adamantine Chains. Loth. When Time and Marriage Rites have fix'd your Worth, Deep in her Mind, she must be yours entirely, You'll wean her from her Cares with soft Indulgence, Repeat your Vows, as on the Marriage Day, Never forget the Lover, in the Husband, Then she must lose Lothario, in Anselmo, And that I may not keep this Fire alive, I'll tear the hated Object from your Eyes. [is going. Asp. Oh! Cruel take Aspatia's parting Soul. [she faints. Loth. Oh! Heaven she faints beneath her heavy Grief, My Soul is with her, help me, Sir, to raise her, Pity the poor Aspatia see her Sorrows. Asp. Rigid Anselmo, too relentless Friend, Inexorable, quit my guilty Hand; And give me back, oh give me to Lothario. [He quits her Hand and she runs to Loth. Yes I'll be his, for ever, only his, Or thus I'll kneel, and weep my Life away. Ans. to Loth. How aukardly thou playst the Hipocrite, Come 'tis too much, Lothario, Loth. Too much indeed, and Hipocrite's a Name, You once had blush'd to think your Friend deserv'd. Ans. No more, Sir, take that fatal Beauty back, And if you can return and justifie This horrid Fact, I'll wait you and till then, Stifle my just Resentment;—Oh my Heart. [Exeunt Loth. and Asp. Ans. alone] How have my Crimes incens'd the Powers Supreme. To wound my Soul in it's most tender Parts, My Mistress and my Friend, thoughtless Anselmo Neither deserv'd thy Love; the fickle Maid, I can forgive, for Woman is Deceit, And their false Hearts, receive each new Impression, As the soft Wax the Seal; their frailer Vows Blown to and fro obedient to each Breath, Of empty Air, light as the Down of Thistles, And yet Aspatia's form'd of purer Clay; At least I thought her Mind more Elegant; Lothario too had sinewy Virtue once; At least so I believ'd; but he's a Traitor, Has broke the strongest Ties of Faith and Friendship. Enter Lothario. Well, Sir, have you bestow'd your Charge. Loth. The fair Aspatia delug'd in her Tears, Has beg'd a short Reprieve for a few Hours, E'er she resigns her Freedom, with her Hand. Ans. Why this false Show of Honour, this Disguise, Why do you torture thus a Wretch you've wrong'd, By counterfeiting what Lothario was? Have you not then betray'd me, broke your Trust, And rob'd me of a Mistress, and a Friend. Loth. No, Sir, you rob your Friend by this Distrust, You wrong the Man who laid down more than Life, When he gave up Aspatia to your Arms, The lovely Maid confess'd a mutual Flame, This Conscious let me say was the first Proof, This fatal Passion only cou'd evince, My Honour was superior to my Love. Ans. Yes, when you'd basely practis'd with her Virtue, And talk'd your self into her tender Heart, You play this after Game, this poor mock Show; Do you not love, did not your guilty Eyes Mingle their fiery Beams with my Aspatia's, When confident in your superior Interest, With treacherous Arts you triumph'd o'er her Soul, Then bring your counterfeited Victim here, And brave me with an empty Sacrifice. Loth. By Heav'n, by all those spotless Pow'rs that claim The Conduct of our Passions, here I swear, From the first Moment that this fatal Fire Inflam'd my Heart, I vow'd my self its Martyr, I gave her to your Arms, my self to Death, Oh fatal hard Dilemma, I must die Unless Aspatia's mine, nor can I live, Live perjur'd by her Love, and wrong Anselmo. Ans. What would'st thou talk me from my just Resentment, Oh my reluctant Soul, that I shou'd live To know Lothario's but a glossing Slave, A Parasite that crept into my Trust, And got him Credit purely to deceive: Draw Villain, with thy Sword defend that Life, Thy Words with ineffectual Vigour try'd. Loth. And can thy Sword stab deeper after Villain, Villain and Parasite; oh be assur'd Anselmo, When first I heard those Words, I held my Life Of no Account, not worth the least Defence, Mistaken Man—Fulfil the mighty Woe, By this last Act, the Murther of thy Friend. Ans. Friend, thou perfidious Coward, I thy Friend, No, from the common Joal I'd choose a Ruffian As rank a Knave as ever fell by Justice, Then hug him to my Bosom, call him Friend, He cou'd not prove a Traitor like Lothario. Loth. Wound me not thus with Words—your Sword's unsheath'd, For oh I feel my burning Blood boils high, And Reason flies before it. Ans. Thou lyest, thy Blood is all one Jey Cake, An Ague shakes thy Limbs, and dastard Fear Disarms thy trembling Hand. Loth. [draws] Enough—be cancell'd all that worthy Hoard Of Honour, antient League, and friendly Bonds, Take back thy Traitor, Villain, Parasite. [They fight, Anselmo is disarm'd. Ans. Hah, feeble Arm; Curse on my cloudy Fate, Lothario lives, He lives, and Conquers both in Love and War. Loth. There, Sir, receive your Sword, and use it now, Now you're convinc'd my Courage is not false, I'll prove my Friendship true, if you can hear, And like a Man temper impetuous Heat. Ans. There's something—so forgiving and so kind, So Godlike in thee, if thou dost prove true, I shall run mad with Horror to reflect How I have us'd thee; wou't thou then forgive me. Loth. All, all will I forgive; and tho' the Light Be not so dear to me as thy Aspatia, I will restore her to your longing Arms; Provide a Priest, and when the Evening's Dusk With his grey Mantle folds the dewy Air, Beneath yon Convent's Walls you shall receive her; Yes, she will keep her Vow, and give her Hand, Her Heart perhaps may follow: Me she'll forget when I am mix'd with Earth, And the cold Grave has bury'd all Distinction. Ans. Oh my Lothario! now I know thee all, Blind 'till this Moment to thy Countless Worth; Capacious is thy Mind, unlimited, Great, generous; a Spark of Heav'nly Heat Strikes thro' my Soul, and warns me to be Just, Just to the sacred Friendship which I owe; Take back th'ador'd Aspatia, thee she loves, Me she abhors; I am her last Aversion, And thou her lovely Pride, her softest Wish. Loth. No more of that fix'd as the Law supreme Is my Resolve, Aspatia shall be yours, Without a Rival yours; spare, spare your Thanks; 'Tis Friendship all, 'tis rigid Honour's due, And I must be most Cruel to be True. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Enter Lothario and Aspatia. Asp. Your rigid Honour like a burning Torch Preys on it self, with self consuming Fires You waste, they light you downwards to the Grave; Already your pale Cheeks, your languid Eyes, Confess the civil Strife that reigns within; Shake off my Lord this inauspicious Wretch, Think on me as a Creature doom'd by Heav'n To blast your growing Peace, your evil Genius; Reflect on that Serenity of Mind, That Harmony of Thought, those mutual Joys That flow'd from Souls united, bless'd in all Fortune or Friendship cou'd on Man bestow, Then think on me, think on the fatal Storm That dash'd on Rocks, and Shipwreck'd all at Once; Yes, leave me Sir, to my abandon'd Fate; Tear, tear me from your Bosom, your Aspatia, Wide as the distant Winds and Seas can bear you, Fly this Disturber of your sweet Repose. Loth. Accuse thy partial Fate, unhappy Maid, That forc'd thy tender Heart to hear my Vows, And taught it to be sensible of Love; Indulge me yet a little in my Ruin, Ah suffer me to look my Life away, While prostrate at thy Feet I tell my Love, And let my latest Accent sigh Aspatia; But hark Anselmo calls, my injur'd Friend, Demands thee all, and we must part, my Love, I have thy Word, thy Faith to be Anselmo's, Yes thou bright Excellence let ardent Virtue, By this unequal'd Force of generous Love, Inroll thee with the Stars. Asp. Yes I will save Lothario, At least I'll struggle with heroic Energy, To conquer all this Tenderness of Soul, Stifle my rising Sighs, and choak my Tears, Till my swell'd Heart-strings burst, and scalding Rain Burns this frail Beauty up. Loth. Distressful Nature starts with Horror back, And shuns the dreadful Conflict, no Aspatia, I will not dare to ask thee too be miserable, Live in thy Virgin Innocence secure, But oh! forget, raze from thy Memory If thou wou'dst court sweet Peace, my fatal Name, For that must live the Scorn of vulgar Tongues, A Villain that betray'd his Friend, that rob'd him Of all that he held dear! Let not Reflection bring me to thy Thought, Least thou contemn my Ashes, let all be lost, As if recorded in the Sand or Flood, Farewel, may softest Peace, and living Joys Wait on you here, till Time be swallow'd up, In never dying Bliss. Asp. —Stay, stay, Lothario, Tho' Nature Shrinks, and shuns the fiery Combat, Yet I will fall thy Martyr, yes my Soul, Touch'd with magnetic Virtue owns the Sympathy, And dares not suffer thee to be unjust, My Hand shall be Anselmo's, and while Life, While feeble Life supports the Loss of thee, Thy Eriend shall bind me his, in Marriage Chains, This Evening shall conclude it, lead me forth, Yes let us then in solemn Silence part, Without one Word to raise the glowing Embers No not a Whisper, with a sable Veil, I'll hide these Eyes, while you perform your Vow, And give me to Anselmo. Loth. Words will but wrong what nothing can express, Health giving Maid, Cure to my wounded Soul; At what a mighty Price I save my Faith, Oh! dear bought Friendship— Angelic Forms dress'd in Empyreal Light, When they descend to Mortals so they talk, So look, so charm the Sences into Transport, But oh! the Heavenly Vision dissapears, And all is dark again, yes I must lose thee, Lose thee for ever—no—my Soul shall quit This Earthly Clog, then will I swift ascend, And work a Starry Crown for my Aspatia, Expect thee there, there in those Realms of Light, Where thou and I, and my Anselmo's Soul Refin'd from Dross and Visionary Honour, Shall all enjoy Eternity of Friendship.— Asp. Alass the working Passion hurts thy Mind, Retire, compose thy self, all will be well.— [Exeunt. Asp. returns with Jul. Jul. Why this distracting Scene, wherefore appears, This wild Confusion, in the downy Breasts Of mutual Lovers, great Lothario's Heart, Seems all distorted with Convulsive Pangs, Intemperate Sorrow shakes thy tender Frame, The Roses leave thy Cheeks, a sickly Pale, Spreads o'er thy Face; oh! tell me dear, Aspatia, In Friendship's Name thy Grief. Asp. —Friendship, accursed Word, Bane of my Peace, and Source of all my Tears, No Parents Curse disjoins our meeting Hands, No former Oath of plighted Love divides us, No distant Lands, or Seas, or Rocks between, No jealous Pangs disturb us; jealous Honour, Parts us as far as Seas or Winds can drive, And we shall never meet, unequal Fate, This Night he gives me to his dying Friend, And I am sworn t'obey him veil'd and silent, That neither Language of the Heart or Eyes, May raise the burning Embers, have I Cause To weep and Sigh—yes everlasting Cause— Jul. Ah how perverse is thy sad Fate and mine, I die for this Anselmo, whom your Soul, Meets with the utmost Horror, the soft Heat, With macerating Fire consumes me still, And tho' he basely broke his solemn Contract, For which my Brother vows him constant Hate, And still pursues him with his vengeful Sword, Yet I still love the Traitor, oh, Aspatia, Forgive me that till now I blush'd to own, That this slow Feaver hung about my Soul, But 'tis a fatal Truth, we both are curs'd, From the same Fountain both our Sorrows spring. Asp. I thought till now that his unjust Disdain, Had quite effac'd his Image in your Heart, Unhappy, Julia, let us mourn our Sorrows, And weep in Consort; yes there is Relief, From mutual Tears, and Harmony in Grief. [Exeunt. Enter Sebastian and his Friend. Seb. Triumphant in his Guilt he laughs at Vows, Elate with Pride and boasts to scorn my Sword, Who wou'd not bear shou'd never do a Wrong, That Man betrays himself whoe'er defends His Honour, when he dares to be a Villain: Anselmo thus has wrong'd himself and me By breaking his most solemn Vows to Julia, But he shall do her Justice; yet this Arm Shall right my injur'd Name, or fall a Martyr, A glorious Martyr in the Cause of Virtue. Ant. This Morn I saw him pensive and alone, Walking behind the Convent of St. James. Seb. I'll search Verona round, he shall not long Escape my Sword; methinks till I have Justice A mighty Load sits heavy on my Soul, As if I felt his Guilt, 'tis mine Antonio Till my good Sword bath'd deep in purple Streams Has wash'd the Stain away—Help me Astræa, Support me Justice 'tis thy sacred Cause, Look down from Heav'n, give thy celestial Aid To my weak Arm, and right an injur'd Maid. [Exeunt. Enter Lothario leading in Julia veil'd at one Door, and Anselmo at the opposite. Loth. to Ans.] Receive as the last Proof, the living Seal Of Faith unbroken, ev'n thy own Aspatia, Imagine when the Soul and Body part, What horrid Images distracting whirl Round the sick Brain: All Nature's Frame is shook, Or think upon a Wretch condemn'd to Fires In Sight of Joys immortal: Think on me, Inevitable Fate, or dire Despair Besieg'd m' unguarded Soul: I might have held Aspatia mine in firm Connubial Bonds, But false to thee, I must have liv'd unworthy Of this bright Gift of Heav'n, I chose to die, Die for you both, both equally deserve it; Thus I shall rise victorious from the Grave. Ans. There is no other Way to prove my Soul Keeps equal Pace with thine: I quit my Right, Receive Lothario back this fatal Gift, 'Tis I must die, eternal Fate has doom'd it; Yet, yet my parting Soul shall mix with thine, The general Lamp extinguish'd, shall in thee Light up a brighter Flame, and live Aspatia's. Loth. Unalterable is my firm Decree, Farewell, tho' I must rob you of a Friend, Aspatia will be yours; farewell for ever. [Exit Loth. Ans. Thy trembling Hand Aspatia still declares The Terror of thy Mind: No, thou shalt live, Live a long Life in Peace with thy Lothario, That Godlike Youth merits the greatest Gift, The greatest Bliss that Man can tast below; Let me conduct thee quickly to Lothario; Yes, you shall both be happy, 'tis resolv'd, Howe'er the Gods dispose the lost Anselmo. As they are going off, Enter Sebastian. Seb. Stay Sir, return, one Word, there is a Debt, A Debt of Honour due to me, and Julia, Which thus you must Discharge. [Draws. Ans. Tho' I disown your Claim, you shall be answer'd; Come on Sir, bright Aspatia be the Word. Seb. Aspatia is the fairest of her Sex, And must disown a perjur'd Wretch like thee. [They fight, Julia interposing is wounded by Anselmo and falls. Ju. For Heaven, for Nature's Sake Sebastian hold, Hold thou Anselmo, as you Mercy hope; Alas the guilty Steel has pierc'd my Heart; Yet 'tis some Pleasure that I die by thee, By my Anselmo's Hand. [They pause a while. Ans. —Hah Julia hurt, Accursed hand, yes thou art born Anselmo, Foredoom'd to be the Death of all who Love thee; Seb. Come, Sir, the dreadful Scene is yet not finish'd, And Julia's bleeding Image strikes my Soul, Redoubles Rage and Vengeance. Ans. Tho' I despise my Life, I will defend it, To know why Julia took Aspatia's form; Thou sha't not be a Victor yet fond Youth. [They renew the Fight, Anselmo is wounded and falls. Thou hast thy Wish, I faint, my bleeding Heart will Cure my wounded Soul. Julia. Hear me Anselmo, for my Spirits fail, How I have lov'd thee let my Dying witness; Aspatia first spoke of your Rival Friend, And the whole Progress of your fatal Loves, She told me too she must be offer'd up This Evening Veil'd and silent by your Friend; But I prevented all, and Veil'd appear'd E'er the appointed hour to your Lothario, Who led me, as he thought, his own Aspatia, And gave me to your Arms, nor did Aspatia Know the deceit. What my fond Heart cou'd Hope From such a Marriage must be vain—But Heaven Has put a period to my Love and Life. [Dyes. Ans. Fate has determin'd, and I justly fall. Seb. (Kneeling by Julia) Ah! thou fair Flower torn from thy tender Stalk In thy sweet Bloom, She's gone, the Soul is fled, Her Eyes, those Christal Orbs, have lost their Fires, And Death, cold Death seiz'd all her beauteous Limbs. Thy hand Sebastian too is Crimson'd o'er, And blushes with a Sisters Blood,—Oh Heav'n Accept my Vow, from this unhappy Hour I'll leave the Guilty World, and in a Convent Wast all my future Life in Prayer and Penitence, And wash with Tears unfeign'd my sullied Soul. [Exit Seb. Enter Lothario. Loth. Why does the Soul thus cleave to hated Earth, Has she one Hope to aid her? Black Despair Damps all her Native Heat, Obscures her Light, And all within is Chaos and Confusion: No, she speaks Peace no more; sweet Peace is gone. Ans. Lothario—Oh, my Friend! Loth. —Hah! what do these Eyes behold, Anselmo dying—Sweet Aspatia dead— Here is a Scene of Guilt—of Blood and Guilt; Heroic Maid, thou most Illustrious Youth, Is this thy Bridal Bed? Are these the Joys Of Hymen? Must we all be tortur'd thus For loving to excess? Both Murther'd—Both Oh! 'tis too much ye Powers, ye give me Strength And Reason but to make me greatly wretched. Ans. Temper thy Grief Lothario, hear me speak; Hear thy expiring Friend speak words of Joy, Sweet Comfort to thy Soul. [Lothario Drawing his Sword. Loth. Yes I will Kneel and hear thee. What didst thou mention Comfort, here it is, Yet have I strength to shake the Burthen off; Two such Companions in my Death, 'tis Joy, 'Tis Transport, and I feel again Repose: Thus then I come. [As he would Rise, Ans. holds him. Ans. Hold Sir, I beg you hold and hear me speak, Aspatia lives, lives for her own Lothario: There Julia lies, that Julia whom I wrong'd, Slain by this Hand, just as she interpos'd Between Sebastian's fatal Sword and mine. Enter Aspatia, Leonato, Servants. Live, Live Lothario, thus that equal hand That deals unerring Justice to his Creatures, Commands thee by my fall; I faint, farewell. [Dyes. Loth. Behold Aspatia, see Anselmo Dying, He's gone, for ever gone; Oh my Aspatia [Loth. stands in a fix'd Posture. Asp. Fate has determin'd for us, You have lost The just Anselmo, I the faithful Julia; Both merit Tears, and never dying Gratitude. Leon. Remove the Bodies, 'tis a mournful sight; Sebastian with a bleeding Heart inform'd me Of what here happen'd. Hence be warn'd my Children, Of breaking Vows, and violating Truth. Hence let the perjur'd Lover learn his Doom, The hand of Justice tho' 'tis slow will come: For tender Virgins Sighs those Powers must move, Who are like them, All Harmony and Love. FINIS.</field>
