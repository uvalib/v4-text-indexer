      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âThe Roman Senate assembled in the Capitol. Fabius, Fulvius, Nero, &amp;c. Enter Livius. Fab. You come late, Liviusâyet to-day our business Does much concern you, for the people's choice, At this disastrous time, has fallen on you To share the consulship with Claudius Nero. Liv. I have done with you and yours for evermore. I'll never stir a finger in your cause. Fab. What, Livius! Well I know that it may seem You have had some cause to think your country dealt Severely with you once; but it is time To lay aside your wrath, and do your best To show a noble spirit in this need. We have looked round, and still we cannot find A man more fit to serve us in our strait. Since from Illyria thou, twelve years ago, Cam'st home victorious, we have never seen A triumph in these streets. Thine was the last. And though it may be at that very time There was injustice done thee, and a fault Laid to thy charge, such as an honest man Shall feel most sharply and indignantly, Yet even then was never whisper heard From the most bitter enemy amongst them, Against thy soldier-bravery and skill. Wilt thou supply the place of the brave dead? We have no Gracchus, no Flaminius now, And no Marcellus: all have flung away Their noble lives in vain on the same rock. Whom shall we look to, now, but you and Nero? Say, will you take up arms and save your country? Liv. Ay, you can change your tone now you are frighten'd: But I have done with you; I'll not be consul. Fab. What! shall the senate never be enough Humbled before you? Has your wrath no limit? Livius, for shame! give me some other answer. Liv. I will not be your consul. Fab. Gods of Rome! Has this man's heart no Roman pulse in it? Would he have the scornful spear of Hannibal Come ringing to our very feet again? Would he have us see again his curst Numidians Sweeping the banks of Tiber up and downâ Flinging the dust, lightly as sands of Afric, From those wild hoofs in at our very gates? Are you not satisfied with what has been, That you desire more humbling for your country? Another Thrasymene in the north? Another bloodier CannÃ¦ in the south? I think, for ten long years of wasting war, We have found one Hannibal enough for usâ One son of that Hamilcar, who left three. In the rich south he has made his secure home, Gathers its harvests, revels in its fruits, Rules o'er it as a master, orders it As 'twere the heritage his father left him; Makes it a camp for all the foes of Rome, A colony where Afric, Gaul, and Spain Pour in the overflowings of their tribesâ Marches where'er he willânorth, south, east, westâ And not a man of us dares follow him; There's no advantage to be won from hill, River, or wood, that may embolden us To give him battle; and year after year He has seen this, and mocked us to our faces. Nor is his sleepless hatred satisfied With never-ending ravage on this soil; His eyes, far-searching, wander o'er the world To raise us up new foes; where'er a sword Is drawn against us, or a treason planned, By Greek or Syrian, king or tyrantâlo! He is there in spirit; on this earth he moves, The mortal image of Rome's adverse fate. Will you not speak? Liv. Say what you will, I care not. Fulv. I have a word to say upon this matter! Perhaps thou thinkest, Livius, we are met This day to treat about some distant war, Waged but that we may give our wives to wear Barbarian trophies for new ornaments. Perhaps thou thinkest this is not a business That touches theeâthat thou and all thy house May doze away the rest of life in peace, Howe'er it end, surrounded by your sons And sons' sons, let the commons toil and fight How and where'er they may. If so thou thinkest, I tell thee thisâthat thou and I, here met, And all, or high or low, depend for life And death, for ruin and salvation, on The issue of this struggle. Thou thyself May'st see the day when all the commons rise, As 'twere one man, and pluck thee by the beardâ Ay, thee and all of this august assemblyâ Bidding us, with no soft persuasive voice, Cease from this wasting war, and take the terms Which Carthage graciously shall please to send us. I think thou would'st not love to see thine heir, Grandson, or grandson's son, of thine old age, Led off a hostage to a foreign land, To change his father's for the Punic speech, And love the nurture of a Punic hearth. Perhaps thou thinkest 'tis in some child's quarrel That we have armed our very slaves, and bid them Go fight for freedomâthat now, breaking through The custom of old privilege, we call On all the sea-coast colonies for soldiers; That, in the north, three armies watch Etruria, And wait for Hasdrubal; that, in the south, Three more oppose the deadly Hannibal; That we have suffered Scipio to send home From Spain, where warfare is no idle game, One thousand foot, and thrice five hundred horse, And from the prÃ¦tor's force in Sicily Drafted four thousand archers for the south! Liv. What can a man, disgraced by you, do for you? Why do you come to trouble mine old age? Fulv. By the gods! I, too, am old and broken down By many a toil and hardship! I was old When we took Capua in the days gone byâ Ay, and a great revenge I got for Rome!â And I think, verily, that I might rest, If any man might, from my services. But, sir, I mean not to sit idly down, And watch what younger men can do for us; Old as I am, I am bound for Bruttiumâay, And I will find some work for Hannibal! I am not past my zeal for service yetâ But as for Marcus Livius, he, methinks, Was taking leisurely his sleep at noon, Whilst, broad awake, we here, with all our ears, Were listening to Massilia's timely warning; He therefore, haply, has not heard the news Which now fills every other soul in Rome, That Hasdrubal himself now scales the Alps By the same path that let his brother through, And e'er his eyes are quite unsealed from slumber, Down will come thundering on the plains of Padus, With all his swart Numidians at his heelsâ But this, perhaps, is nought to Marcus Livius. Nero. Hear me then, Livius! Hear your enemy! Hear Claudius Nero sue to your proud heart, And pray you, from his soul, to be his colleague. Do you not know, now is the crisis come? That dead Hamilear's trebled in his sons? Do you not know that, breaking loose from Scipio, Now, hot from Spanish fields, comes Hasdrubal, On fire to cut a passage to his brother? Do you not know that soon one country's bounds Will hold the two, all burning to grasp hands, Burning to meet beneath one tent, and shake, By their fell plotting, Rome's foundations? Come, Look up and answer me? Shall this be, Livius, Whilst thou and I can hold this pair asunder? Liv. If I am fit to be a consul, why Was I dismissed by you? If not, why thus Urge me to serve you? Nero. Marcus Livius, know It fits thee to endure thy country's harshness With the submissive patience of a son. This long resentment is a palsying sicknessâ Let a sharp emulation now sting back Thy soul to life; I offer thee this cureâ And, once more, ask theeâwilt thou be a consul? Liv. If any man but thou, my enemy, Had begged this of me, I had ne'er consented. Fab. He hath prevailed then! Livius will be consul. A Sen. O Livius! thou wilt not repent of this, When thou dost triumph in the streets of Rome! Fab. Yet one thing moreâ'tis fitting Rome's two consuls Should be no more called foes. Be reconciled, Ye rivals! to each other. Nero. I am willing. Liv. And why, I pray you? We shall serve the State Far better by our jealousy than friendship. I'll none of itâI'll not be reconciled. Fab. The senate begs this of thee, Marcus Livius. Liv. And Marcus Livius will but beg the senate To leave his loves and hates in his own keeping. Fab. Art thou a Roman, Livius? Wilt thou hear Yet once again the senate sue to thee, For that it might command? Nero. Must I again Humble myself? Will this content thee, Livius, That Claudius Nero begs thy right hand? Liv. Ay! There, take it, and no further words! Enough. I wait the further orders of the senate. Fab. 'Tis best we should assign to the two consuls, By lot, their fields of warfare. [They cast lots. Lo! to Livius Falls Hasdrubal, and Hannibal to Nero. May the gods prosper both! Oh, be not rash, Nor cast away the fruits of our great efforts, By ill-advised battle! Liv. I will fight The enemy that instant I shall meet him. Fab. Thou wilt? Liv. And either conquer him at once, Or by the great disaster of defeat, Revenge my past defeat upon the State. Fab. Livius, let thy proud heart be pacified, And henceforth only seek thy country's good. Happy art thou, whose age has found a hope, For thou hast found again the best of youth. [The Senate breaks up. Scene II. âThe camp of Hasdrubal before Placentia. Carthalo, Abelux, and other officers assembled in the tent of Hasdrubal. Carth. To-morrow morn, farewell then to Placentia! Saguntum's self stood not more stubbornlyâ But we chastised Saguntum, and, alas! We leave Placentia free. Friend Abelux! I think the spirit of your Spanish towns Has flown before us into Italy. An Off. Our drowsy comrade looks far more inclined To sleep away the summer in these plains, Than fight his way to Rome. Abel. I were content To tarry here, and also well content To follow Hasdrubal where'er he goes. But meanwhile I am sleepy, and you will not Leave me to doze in peace. Carth. Thou lazy Spaniard! How wilt thou bear to march with Hannibal, Who flies from north to south, from east to west, O'er hill, and plain, and river, like the windâ Whirling his breathless army at his heels, Till all geography doth stand amazed? But, as for me, when shall I sleep again, With Rome in view? Body and soul seem winged Since we have crossed the Alps. Off. His tortoise-spirit Is wrapped in sweetest dreams, and hears thee not. Carth. 'Tis but a savageâthough a gallant oneâ Whose race has still a human soul to find, Mere beasts of prey as yet, that gorge themselves With slaughter and with plunder half the year, And sleep the other half. Enter Hasdrubal. Hasd. I have kept you waitingâ Oh, friends, my heart is at a festival! To-morrowâyea, to-morrowâwe shall march Along the proudest, happiest, hopefullest road That ever led a brother to a brother. Oh, friends, when we trod o'er the breach he hewed Through the white adamant so long ago, With labour to which ours was but a jest, I could have kissed the very snow whereon He left the footprints of his thousands, graven In traces everlasting as the frost. But I could wish that I had left behind A garrison in this stubborn colony. Carth. A plague on all the Latin colonies! It is the Latin Name has hitherto Saved Rome from Hannibal. But for those nests Of pestilent hornets, long ere now her Senate Had humbled its stiff neck down to the dust. Howe'er it be, I would you had lingered less Before this insolent city. True it is, You have come sooner down into the plains Than you were looked for, butâ Hasd. Oh, peace, Carthalo! No âbutsâ this happy eve. Give me that map. For our friend there, I guess his Spanish soul Lies dreaming of his own betrothÃ«d bride, And the fine gold and gems he will snatch for her From many a proud patrician's perfumed tressesâ Or haply dreams of nothing. Come here, comradesâ Is not this map, Carthalo, like a poem That chants to us his tale of victory? Where'er I set my finger is a triumphâ I could be telling o'er these names for ever! Why, all the air we breathe, breathes of his deedsâ And Trebia still, methinks, seems red with them. Oh, brother, hast thou left me any spot To consecrate mine ownâone field for me? Unkind, didst thou forget, amidst thy glory, Thy father left another son to share Thy foreign heritage, and gather in, With thee, the purple vintage of revenge? Carth. This very moment, be you sure, he counts The hours that bring you to himâand Rome, too, Counts them and trembles. Hasd. So I hope, Carthalo. To us, to us, to our avenging house, The Moloch of this land, must the doomed city Offer the flower of all her children up, For the burnt sacrifice our souls delight in. Oh! Italy, whilst thus from north to south Mine eye sweeps o'er thee, how my soul devotes All that I look on to Hamilcar's sons! And, oh! Carthalo, think how we shall meet The maidens of our city dancing forth With timbrel-chorus, and the noise of harps, And voice of song, to celebrate our deeds! How we, like lions, raged abroad to share The spoil of Italy, and come back, laden With all the wealth and fatness of the land! My comrades, oh! but I must needs be mad, Thus to exult before the deed is done! Not so my Hannibal, when he set forth, In youth's fierce bloom, to do his holy mission, Uttered aloud the passion which flashed light Heroic, from the sternness of his face. Blest is that ardour which can find no words! It finds a tenfold emphasis in deeds. Ten years ago, ten crowded years, Carthalo! And now it seems to me but yesterday That we two parted. Carth. But to meet again! I would I could have seen how Scipio looked, When he discovered how much he had won By his great victory of BÃ¦cula, And knew that you were plunging into Gaul, Far o'er the northern hills, whilst he, alack! Perched high amongst the chilly eastern skies, Watched all the weary days to see you pass. Oh! youth's presumption, that would bar the way Against Hamilcar's son! Hasd. If I mistake not, There are in that presumptuous youth, Carthalo, The makings of a noble general. He fought, they say, with desperate zeal, at CannÃ¦. But let him beâI'll never grudge him Spain, When Rome is ours. See here my destined way Through Umbriaâay, how easily my finger Travels the path so many thousand men Shall hardly clear for me with the sword's edge! And hereâoh! here, I trace that other path Which o'er th'Etrurian hills brought Hannibal Down to the lake, whose veil of morning mist The war-cry of the Gaul so rudely shook, E'er the broad sun blazed on his triumph. Thence His road is mine, or I will perish. Carth. Ay, And here's Spoletum, here's th'audacious town That dared to close its gates upon the victorâ Another Latin colony, curse upon it! Enter an Officer. Off. My lord, without are Gala and Gulussa Waiting thine orders. Hasd. Bid them to come in. Enter Gala and Gulussa. My trusty soldiers, speed and luck be yoursâ I need not to detain you. Here's the letter, And look you bear it safe to Hannibal, For in it lies the fate of Rome and Carthage. Gul. There is no man fights 'neath a Roman banner Shall live to tear it from me. Hasd. Well said, friend. I fear not but your courage and your cunning Shall bear you safely to your mission's end. Nor need I to remind you what advancement I purpose to reward your skill with. Well, Be gone, my brave Numidians! Do not fail To greet my brother well, and bid him drain A goblet of Falernian to our union Beneath the walls of Rome. And doubt you not You shall partake with himâa brimming cup Of the best grape that's pressed in Italy I dare be sworn awaits you at his board. And what a story shall you have to tell To him and his admiring generals, Of all your dangers and escapes in coming! And what a tale shall history tell of you! So fare you well! Gul. It shall go hard, my lord, But we will win the thanks of Hannibal. [Exeunt Gala and Gulussa. Hasd. Now, friends, let's in to supper. Abelux, I pray you waken. Carth. Wake, thou sluggard, wake! Abel. Why, what's the matter? Carth. Nothing worse than supper. We shall not march to the world's end to-night. Abel. If I can sleep, I can fight too, Carthalo. There's not a man here has not seen me stand Oft and again in the hot battle's front, With my brave tribe, to beat Rome's legions back, Nor for the last time yet. Hasd. True, I'll be bound. [They go into supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âThe camp of Nero at Grumentum in Lucania. Nero in his tent. Enter Catius. Cat. Oh! Nero, fooled and foiled! His camp is empty! The camp-fires and a handful of Numidians Were all of Hannibal we watched last night. Nero. Is it so? Have thou patience. I will hold Fast to his traces still, o'er rough and smooth, By mountain and by valley, town and field, E'er I will let him go to Hasdrubal. Cat. He shakes our legions off from him like flies; And when we swarm around his path again, Lo, he is gone! Nero. Be patient still, I say. He shall not find his Hasdrubal. Cat. Well said,â And yet I think it shame this net of armies We've flung so closely round him, lets him through, Oft as he lists to break its meshes. Nero. Catius, Let us wait. It may be that the gods of Rome Are mightier than ambition of one man. But we have talked enough. 'Tis time to march. Let us trace his steps, and where they lead us, follow. Enter a Soldier. Sold. My lord, this instant has arrived from Rome, Upon an errand to thee, Mutines The African. Nero. Alone? Sold. He comes alone, Having ridden all night. He begs admittance to you. Nero. Let him come in. Mutines is admitted. I greet thee, Mutines. Mut. Thanks, noble consul. Nero. Thou hast an errand to me? Mut. First, I am charged with letters from the senate. [Gives them.] Nero. What art thou charged with else? Mut. This only, Nero. I come to offer thee a soldier's service. Not all the bounteous honour Rome has done me Can make mine idle days supportable. I crave, I thirst for my old trade again. I ask for no commandâonly to ride My charger in thy ranksâto breathe once more The brave air of a camp. Nero. Assuredly I grant thee this. One whom my senate deemed Worthy our citizenship, must be welcome In the army of Rome's consul. For the present I say no more but this. Mut. Thou hast said enough, O noble Nero! for my soul's desire. Suffer me now to care for my tired steed. Nero. Go, then; and having done so, lose no time In seeking out the Master of the Horse, For I am on the point to march from hence. [Exit Mutines. Cat. Strange, truly! Yet not strange in that base mixture Of Libyan and PhÅnician. Why so hot Against his friend and patron to bear arms? 'Twas one thing to desert his cause far off In Sicily, but far another, sure, In battle to confront him to whose favour He once had owed his all, and from whose hand He never had a wrong. But for the gloom Unfeigned, expressed in voice and countenance, I could suspect some treason. Nero. So not I. He has sinned past pardoning, and knows he might As well seek mercy in the tiger's den As in the vengeful camp of Hannibal. Had he meant treason he had feigned more smoothly. The Libyan perfidies are veiled in smiles. [Exeunt Nero and Catius. Scene II. âEvening. Hannibal's army halting. A grove and garden surrounding a ruined villa. Enter Silanus. Sil. Poor ruined walls! I half could moralize Over your graceful desolationâask What blessings Hannibal has brought as yet To those who once did own you, gliding thus Like a magician o'er the land by nightâ And truly yon faint-humming multitude Stands in the twilight like a spectral hostâ This, and more questions I could ask of you, Were I not more inclined, just now, to sleep. Enter Adherbal. Now thou art come to say we march again, Because I just had found the couch of moss That suited me, and just the glimpse I sought Of moonlit sky, to shine upon my dreams, Betwixt those broken columns. Now be this My last forced march with Hannibal! Once safe In Metapontum, there I mean to stay, Bathe thrice a day, and never mount mule more. Adh. I'll mount thee on an elephant instead. I know thee better than to think thou'lt miss The meeting of the brothers, that's so near. But thou may'st doze a moment till we learn What news Maharbal and his squadrons bring. Already they're returning. Hearken! Hear'st thou Their jingling bridles and their muffled tramp In yonder grassy hollow? Here they come! Enter Maharbal and cavalry at a little distance. Prompt and successful ever! Ha! Maharbal! Mah. [Dismounting and approaching.] This bold new consul will scarce tread, methinks, So closely on our heels a third time! Well, I grudge not the small trouble of his schooling, Just for the pleasure of this capture. Come! Let's see the villain's face. Lead him before me. Mutines is led in as a prisoner. Adh. Ha! we salute thee. Mah. Here's a sight, indeed, For honest eyes! What, not content, base cur, With selling fame and faith at Agrigentum, That thou must needs carry thy shameless front Into the field against us? I am glad, Ay, glad at heart, we sent no spear-point through thee, Traitor, for whom a dog's death is too good! Mut. I owe thee of my actions no account. I have nought to do with thee, nor care what death, Nor by whose hand I die. Mah. Proud, half-blood devil! Here's one I see approaching, before whom E'en thine own brazen infamy shall blush. Sil. [Rising.] I must see this. Here's ready for my tablets A scene that will not need embellishing. Enter Hannibal. Han. Welcome back! Nero has been taught his distance! Mah. 'Tis the old taleâthey will not stand our charge. Bold dogs they areâand yet, to drive them back, To pick a pebble up will soon suffice. But here's an old friend, whom thou hast not greeted. Hast thou forgotten Mutines? Han. Him there? Mean'st thou the man who hides his face from me, Like a convicted thief before the lash? No, you mistakeâthis is not Mutines, This is the new-made Roman citizen, Who wears his honours with such Roman boldness! Mut. I thought I could have borne it. Hannibal! Release me from thine eyes! Deathâdeath! not torture. Han. I do not pity thee. Wert thou my brother, That so betray'dst thy country, I would still Spurn thee as now. Mut. I had no country. Carthage Denied me a son's rights. Carthage despised me. Thou know'st we have no country. Han. Thou hadst that, Wherever Rome had foes, or I a camp. A great cause was thy country. Dost thou think I ever deigned to reckon up the drops Of Libyan blood in thee against the Punic? Thyself hast sold thy birthright, proved thyself The mongrel that thou art, who might'st have bid For fame, beside the purest blood of Carthage. I made thee great, it seems, to teach thee basenessâ I trained thee to those arms thou hast turned against meâ I trusted thee with Sicily and my hopes, That of thine honour thou might'st make with Rome A profitabler bargain. Mut. Hannibal! I longed for thee, yet feared thee like hell-fire. I swear to thee, that save for the one hope To see thy face again, though but as now, In shame and in despair, I had not lived To meet this moment. Tell me, then, if thus I agonize who loved thee, what more yet Should they endure for ever, whose base envy Maddened me into baseness, maddened me To blast, as is man's wretched privilege, In one brief moment, with a vain remorse, All that is left of lifetime? Han. Mutines, Thou know'st thy fate. I march to Metapontum. There expiate thou thy crime. Go, we shall meet No more in this world. Mut. [Turning away.] Metapontum! Oh, Had I not drained the cup of bitterness! [Exit, guarded. Han. Soldiers, you saw a traitor in his shame. Go, thank the gods you are not such as he. Mah. And that's the manâI think I see him nowâ Who dashed before me into Thrasymene, After the flying Romans, crying out, âOne day we'll hunt them into Tiber thus.â He will be missing when that moment comes. Sil. No man more truly felt the thing he was. Pity some actor was not by to copy That gesture at the approach of Hannibal. I half expected an applauding murmur. Adh. Didst thou so? Should I die in Roman chains, Thou'dst calmly note the workings of my face At twisting of the noose? Sil. Perhaps I might; But I desire not such a fate for thee. [Exeunt omnes. Scene III. âMetapontum. The house of Ianthe. Ianthe reclining on a couch whilst a slave dresses her hair. Slave. Now, lady, to thy sweet face hold this mirror, And say have I well done? Dost thou approve The foldings of thy mitra? Seest thou not That which will make the fairest weep for envy? Have I well done? Ian. Thy fingers are enchanted, And what I see I think is beautifulâ Yet put back this one tress. Oh, sure, Eunice, I must be lovelier than Lysistrata? Slave. Though all the jewels of Taprobane Should deck her brow, her beauty would grow haggard Before one glance out of these long-lashed eyes, Before one smile upon these sweet red lips. Ian. And yet, Euniceâ Slave. Does my mistress sigh? Ian. Why do the gods not send me worshippers Worthy this beauty? Eun. All the city owns thee For fairest, and is prostrate at thy feet. Ian. O gods, I care not for this chattering town! I would Rome might besiege usâanything To break this stagnant calm. Enter Stratonice. Slave. Most gracious lady! Chide my sweet mistress! She has sighed just now Over her very beauty. Strat. Does she so? Then does she merit, ere her time, to see In this same mirror, not these lustrous lengths Of plaited hair, these cheeks so rose-leaf smooth, These eyes as limpid as Blandusia's well, But pale sad age like mine, whose foolish youth For beauty would have gladly paid a world. Come, thou spoiled child! what is thy silly grief? Ian. Oh, if thou knew'st the dream I had, last night! One of those dreams that glorify the past, And make the present dreary. 'Tis so hard, With the half-sweet, half-sad enchantment on us, To know the past will never come again, Yet to desire nought else. Strat. What past regret'st thou? What hast thou ever wished for, and not had? I have spoiled thee, child. Ian. Ah, thou hast never guessed! I have been weary when I wished for nought, But since I've found a wish, it has become A vain regret, and I am weary still. To wish is not to live, only to dream. I want hope too.âAnd yet the pain had grown Fainter, and might have healed, but for this vision Some god has sent to plague me. I beheld him, As in the days he loved me, and my heart Sprang up and groaned to know if still he lovesâ But I shall never know. Strat. By heaven, whom mean'st thou? What secret's this? Ian. I was ashamed to tell thee. Thou wilt wonder when thou hear'st itâI have ceased To wonder at myself. Strat. Wonder indeed! I thought thou couldst not love, but wert content To laugh through life at thy despairing wooers. Ian. Well, I will tell thee. Thou rememberest Our day of triumph at that happy timeâ How happy and how long ago it seems! That blessed time when Rome withdrew from us Her hateful garrison to guard Tarentum, And we threw wide our gates to Hannibal. Dost thou remember how we watched him enter? Oh, what a festival of joy that was! Strat. A mad time truly! Much we gained indeed! Much we Greeks profit by this haughty stranger, Who whilst he courts us, scorns usâstudies our lore, And speaks our language, only to beguile usâ Sits at our citizens' boards, calls us his brothers, And crazes all our youth with idle hopes,â To plague us with a never-ending noise Of war and troubleâbrings on our fair lands The fire and sword of Romeâand to what end? Rome was our mistress, trueâbut we had peace, And led our lives in merriment and ease. The Carthaginian is our master now, And peace seems fled for ever. Every day I tremble for the tidings of the next. Think, should some Roman spear send post to Hades That man's fierce soulâwhat help, what hope is ours, What refuge from the dire revenge of Rome? Would he had never come, whose entrance here You look back to with such rapture! Well, no matter. Proceed with thy love-tale. Ian. What wilt thou say To hear my foolish thoughts that day I speak of? My heart so beat at the first trumpet-sound! It seemed to me as if my fate drew nigh When those strange warriors first came riding in! And I, all rapt, gazing on Hannibal, Was thinking, âwomen are ambitious tooâ Men conquer empiresâwe, the conquerors. Oh, if the world's one hero were my slave! Oh, might his worship fix me in the skies, A visible star to dazzle all mankind! The Queen of Heaven herself might envy me.â Strat. Oh, thou vain child! was this thy dream? Ian. So dreamt I, When one of those that rode beside him, raised His eyes and smiled upon meâflashed me back As 'twere a silent answer to my thoughtâ Rode on and still looked back. And IâI passed Unnoticed all those famous generals by, That rode with Hannibal, all save this oneâ So was my soul filled with that brilliant glance. Strat. Tell me his nameâwhich was it? Ian. Mutines. Strat. What, Mutines, the half-blood Carthaginian, He of the mixed race? was it Mutines, The traitor Mutines? Is he thy hero? Ian. What was his blood to me? He was the son Of Hannibal's own camp, his favoured soldier. I knew him brave and famous, and I saw him Proud as the proudest, noble as the noblest, And worthy as the best blood there, to ride At Hannibal's right hand. Strat. He thought not so. Was it not he threw open to LÃ¦vinus The gates of Agrigentum? Was it not he Lost Sicily to Hannibal for ever? Ian. Alas! alas! Yet he adored him still, I know, I feel that he adored him still! But think what stinging outrage urged him on,â Is there a man on earth that could have borne it? Those envious fools, forsooth, that Carthage chose To trust her fortunes to in Sicily, Thought only how to thwart his deep-laid plans, To court defeat by their presumptuous follyâ And then disgraced him! Took his high command From him whom Hannibal himself had chosen! What wonder he was maddened? Strat. Is it so? Thou really lov'st him? Child, I must hear more. Ian. Thou know'st not whilst he stay'd in Metapontum, Commander of the Punic garrison, Scouring the country round with his Numidians, A terror to the enemy, our pride And safeguardâhow I've watched him riding in Gay and successful, with his eager face Glancing up towards me, as amongst my maids I sat upon my roofâand well I knew He loved me. Every morn I woke a queen, To reign o'er his great heartâuntil, at last, A strange thing chancedâfor once as I reclined, Dreaming the noon away in my cool hall, Horsehoofs that clattered on the marble floor Startled me, and a swart Numidian sprang Down from his charger, bent his face to the ground, And laid this costly token at my feet, This gorgeous girdle of a Roman knight,â Saying, âMutines to the fairest of the fair.â Then rose, remounted, and was gone again. And once I met him in the street of Tombs, When thither with Eunice I had gone To hang upon my husband's funeral urn The customary garland. Such a strange Wild face of anger! as he seized my hands And cried, âOh, dost thou better love the dead, Ianthe, than one living, who would die A thousand deaths for thee?â Strat. What didst thou answer? Ian. I answered smilinglyâOh, pardon me, My husband's mother, I beseech of thee, That which I said, for I was terrified, And scarce knew what I saidââI love no man, Living or dead.â And then he let me go, And I passed homeward trembling and amazed. When next I saw him, all his face was dark And melancholy as a starless night, And a strange pity filled me. On the morrow Came a sharp pang I never yet had dreamt of, For 'twas reported he was bound in haste For Sicily, at Hannibal's behest. Then first I knew I loved him, and I sat Beneath the laurel in the court, my throat Choking, and a faint sickness at my heart, When suddenly, a step! I looked, I saw Himself approach me eagerlyâkneel down Before me, and in silence kiss my robe. At last he spoke: âLady, I go this eveâ I go to wage our war in Sicily. Know now I love thee more than ever yet Man has loved woman. Shall I find thee still Cold to a soldier's love when I return? Or wilt thou quite forget me?â I replied, âWhen thou com'st back to me, O Mutines, Ask me again that question.â While his eyes Flashed eagerly, yet doubtful, and my soul Kept whispering to itself, âI cannot love This half-blood stranger, this half-Carthaginian, And yet I cannot lose himââlo! in rode That same Numidian, and delivered him A letter. Fiercely he glanced o'er it, turned, Embraced me with a hasty agony, Sprang on his horse without another look, And galloped from me. I have never more Seen him, nor ever shall; shall never know If still he loves meâif he suffers pain To be thus severed from me. Oh! he thinks, Perhaps, I scorn him now! Strat. So should'st thou scorn him! Forget him as he has forgotten thee! This then's the dream for which thou pin'st away! Thou, with thy pure Hellenic blood and nurture, Forget'st my son, thy husband, in his grave, And turn'st from all that's best of thine own race To court the homage of a Libyan stranger! Ian. Ah! it was the strange southern soul allured me! Compared with all our chattering graceful Greeks, These sons of Afric seem to me like gods. Until I saw him I had never lived! A love so beautiful, so wonderful, I never had before, nor ever dreamed. Oh, that was life! I might have been content, Had I ne'er known him, with the prettiness And commonplace of Metapontine homage; But now I know a different happiness. When to thy Lysias I was given, oh, lady, I was a child; and when I lost him, still Was half a child. And then the tide of war, Rolling in from far lands with Hannibal, Brought me a splendid novelty of passion Which lifted me one moment to the skies, But left me blank and restless. Strat. Yet, the while, Thou hast seemed gay and happy as the rest. Ian. But inwardly so restless. Oh! that dream! I woke and hated my past merriment! I saw him, heard himâbreathed enchanted air, And lived and loved again. Strat. Oh! verily, Has Aphrodite smitten thee with folly! Here's one of thy adorers. Enter Philemon. Ian. We salute thee, Philemon. Phil. Thee I scarcely dare salute, Oh! lady, save with hymns of adoration; For thou art clothed to-day with such a light Celestial, as men know th'immortals by. Ian. Henceforth, Philemon, I discard my mirror, For thou art kinder. Hast thou news to tell me? Phil. Oh! fairest lady, will thou buy mine of me? Ian. Ay, surely, if the price be not too heavy. Phil. I ask but one song to that gilded lyre, Which pines to give an echo to thy voice. Ian. Make a new song for me, and I will sing it. Now for thy news. Phil. That one of his swift marches Brings Hannibal to our town. His messengers Have been seen galloping to the citadel; And at the gates, Numidian horse by scores Continue to appear. Pray Heaven none here Have written Rome love-letters, since his last Departure! Strat. Hush! This town has ever been Of faith unquestioned. Phil. May we so remain, Lest we should one day share Herdonea's fate, And stand to see our city burnt to ashes, After a few preliminary beheadings, Then be chased forth to grumble life away, For penance, in some Bruttian town, as here, These poor Herdonaens grumble. Ian. Hannibal here! What rumours fly before him? Any tale Of battle? Any stirring tidings yet From Hasdrubal? Phil. Nero, we hear, has tracked As closely as he dared, the lion's march; And twice, they say, the lion turned upon him, And sharply has chastised him. Strat. Who comes yonder? Why, 'tis Silanus! Phil. Yea, his very self! Our grave Sicilian friend arrived already! Enter Silanus. Ian. Smiling, with all the old composure, down On our inferior natures.âHail, Silanus! What, com'st thou from the army thus serene, As one that saunters homeward from the baths? Sil. E'en from the baths I come. Phil. Thou hast lost no time. Ian. And Hannibal? Sil. Tarries without the walls A moment longer, but will enter shortly. Ian. Well, then, thy news. Thou hast lived, since last we met, Another chapter of that history Thou mak'st thine idol next to Hannibal. Tell us a page of it. Sil. Nay, I have heard Important tidings since I passed these gates, Which must eclipse my news of Hannibal. Ian. Now wilt thou condescendingly impart Some trifle suited to our littleness; For sometimes thy philosophy will deign To know what passes in this foolish town. Sil. That is my duty, as the chronicler And student of the times. Ian. Well, tell us then. Sil. 'Tis a mysterious story that will charm theeâ Namely, that an Egyptian sorcerer Has suddenly dropped down among youânone Can tell from whence, from land, or sea, or skyâ Who shows his art in all the porticos, Whose magic mirror is a drop of ink, And matchless marvels are displayed therein. Ian. Haste, haste, Philemon! seek him out for me, And fetch him hither! Is this all thy news? Sil. I have besides a tragic tale to tell thee, Out of the very camp of Hannibal, Which with delightful horror will excite Thy feminine fancyâhaply win thy tears. Ian. Oh! this is better still. Haste to unfold it. Sil. A mighty criminal is on his way To gladden all the eyes of Metapontum With a new spectacle. Strat. Pray thee explain. Who is this criminal? What this spectacle? Sil. His public execution is the sight I speak of; for his nameâ'tis one, in truth, Well known to Metapontum. Strat. Tell us, then. Sil. What would you think if it should be your hero, Your sometime governorâe'en Mutines? [Ianthe screams. Strat. Hush! hush! Restrain thyself! Oh! by the gods! He says he knows not what! It is not true. Phil. Thou hast well done, Silanus! Let's begone. [Exit. Strat. Ay, go! [Claps her hands.] Eunice! To thy mistress! Haste! Ian. Oh! stay, Silanus! Stay, I pray, one moment. I must see Hannibal! I must! I will! Oh! who knows but my prayers will move him? None Has ever yet refused me, nor will he. Go, find out where he is; then come for me, And bring me to him. Haste, Silanus, haste! Sil. I dare not bid thee hope. Ian. But thou wilt do this! Haste, or my heart will break. Sil. Well, thou shalt try Thy fortune; but thou know'st not Hannibal. [Exit. Scene IV. âBy the gate of the citadel of Metapontum. Enter Hanno and Maharbal. Hanno. He found you at Grumentum first, then? Mah. Ay, And got there his first lesson from us. Back We sent him helter-skelter to his camp, At the first glimpse of his presumptuous face; Then, as I told you, leaving our fires burning, Slipped off by night the old way. Once more only His horse came close enough to be chastised. 'Twas then we caught our truant Mutines. Hanno. This Nero is in earnest. Not for long Has consul dared so closely dog our steps. He will not give us passage to the north, Without a blow. Mah. Welcome to give and take! Oh! to stake all upon one furious hour, Dash at the throat of Nero, and have done! So near our one last chance, and still to wait, Sore plagues me. Something, too, keeps whispering me We shall outstay our luck. Hanno. Come, patience, patience! You're ever thusâfretted with black misgivings, When you are not in the full tide of march, Or the wild whirl of battle. Mah. Oh! I tell thee I shall not breathe till we are on the road, With Nero boldly marshalled on our front, And trumpets sounding battle. Then, we'll hope, Both brothers in the Capitol may sup At that same board which these ten years agone Waited so long for one of them in vain. Hanno. Again that tale? But would'st thou have him, then, Rush northward e'er he knows his brother's road? Mah. Oh! never doubt he comes by UmbriaâHa! The Greek philosopher, by all that's wondrous! Withâwhy, the lady weeps, for all her finery! Enter Silanus with Ianthe. Ian. I do not see himâtell me, do you see him? Hanno. [To Maharbal.] Hush! let us watch. Sil. I see him coming, now. Enter Hannibal. I bring thee here a suppliant, Hannibal. [Ianthe throws herself at his feet. Ian. Oh, mercy, mercy, Hannibal, my lord! Han. Rise, lady! Tears and passion are not needed, If thy request be fit for me to grantâ If not, they must not move me. Ian. Oh, my lord! I only ask thy pardon for a man Thou once didst love! Spare hapless Mutines! Han. No, by my father's soul, I will not, lady. Ian. Thou wilt! thou wilt! Thou canst not mean to kill himâ So noble, happy, and honoured onceâso fallen, So miserable, now! Han. Thou askest, lady, My grace for one who does not wish to live. Why should he live? No place is left on earth For such an one as he. Ian. Yes, yes, oh, yes! For he shall learn new loyalty from me! I love himâhe loves meâand I will hold him Fast to his faith by charms that mock at magic! Believe, thou never shalt repent thy mercy! Believe, believe, there's power in love like mine! Believe, believe, there's power in penitence! Trust to the generous ties that bind for ever The pardoned to the pardoner! Speak the word, And send me happy home. Han. Ask me no more! He who betrayed his first love, in that cause Which he was born to, reared in, and adoredâ Thinkest thou he would not, lady, betray thee? Ask me no more. Resign thyself. Ian. I will not! No, no! I will not! Come then, thou who art Our hope, our pride, our master! who hast saved us, By thine own godlike arm, from abhorred Rome! Thou, happy on that loftiest peak of fame, So dazzling to my woman's eyes from far, Be not all brightness, and all glory! Deign To be loved, Hannibal, as well as worshipped! Oh, yes, I know that thou wilt grant my prayer! I know thou wilt! Keep thy stern looks for men; To me thou wilt be gentle! Han. Lady, pray That death from that man's soul may cleanse the stains, The blacker as his nobleness seemed brighter. I blame thee not that the star dazzled thee, Whose sad eclipse thou couldst not prophesy, For he was prompt and fiery in his looks, As in his deeds, and seemed, indeed, the hero He might have been, but was not. Ian. Speak'st thou so, Oh! and canst think, without a freezing horror, Of trampling out by thy deliberate will, So warm, and bold, and passionate a soul, From this bright, beautiful life, that we enjoyâ This human life we cannot live but onceâ This human life, at longest, all too shortâ Of snatchingâhorrid robbery!âfrom thy fellow That once delicious prime of glowing manhood, Whose strength and fierceness, hope and love, and laughter, And revels of the wine-cup, dance, and song, The very gods might envy humankind? Restore him this, and I but live to bless, Love, and adore thee! Han. Live, but not for this. The life thou paint'st I cannot give him backâ The baser life that's left to him, I will not. Ian. Relentless heart! Oh, cruel Carthaginian! Dost thou live only to surround thyself With tears, and groans, and terror? Didst thou come Into this pleasant land, only to slay? Art thou the same, then, in thine iron manhood As ever in thy fierce and dreadful youth, Which o'er a shrieking landâo'er hearth and field, Strewn with their unarmed corpses, whose sole crime Had been the name of Romanâlong ago, All the sad length of Adria's smoking shore, From Trebia swept to CannÃ¦'s horrid shambles? Oh, on such heaps of slaughtered foes, what profit To fling this one life of a man that loves thee? Han. Enough, enough! No longer waste this passion. What is his life, or mine, or any man's, Weighed with the destinies of Rome and Carthage? I know thy grief is heavyâhis the blame Who cast himself away so madly. Yet, If, when I war with men, I stop to count The tears of women, I may sheathe my sword. No house in Rome but maid and matron there Weep tears as sore as thine: so let them weep! The daughters of my people rend their hair For many a dear-loved soldier, slain for Carthageâ Vowed to avenge these, what have I to do With tears that flow for traitors? Mourn not him; Mourn to have loved unworthily; and know, I must be cruel, lady, to be true To that austere commission which my soul Holds from my gods, my country, and my father. Ian. Accurst commission! Why must my heart break? Oh, what to me is Carthage, what is Rome, Or peace, or war, or anything but him? As thou hat'st Rome, so I love Mutines. My passion matches thine, and shall be heard! Silanus, plead for me to this hard heart! What is this mission of thy fancy?âwhat This dire abstraction? Say, who profits by it? Oh, if mankind's made up of human hearts, And every human heart be worthless to thee, What art thou but the foe of all mankind? How dost thou cheat thy nation to believe The groans of each compose the good of all? Still, still I askâwhy must my heart be broken? Think of it once again; strive but this once To comprehend my anguish! Surely, surely, No man on earth should scorn a woman's thanks And blessings! Oh, Silanus, plead for me! Why art thou silent? Hast thou, too, no pity? My heart is breaking. Han. None that knows me, lady, Would plead in such a cause. I pity theeâ Farewell. Ian. Let me go home, now! Let me die! [Exeunt Ianthe and Silanus. Hannibal walks apart with Hanno. Enter Adherbal. Adh. What lovely fury's that? Mah. How should I know? Some poor besotted creature, so bewitched With love of Mutines, the treacherous hound! She needs must come to beg his precious life, And now goes hence despairing. Silly soul! Pity she wastes her tears so. Adh. Heavenly powers! For the first time I envy Mutines. 'Tis well I was not tempted; for one smile I would have granted all. Mah. The more fool thou. Oh, we all know thy softness! Han. [approaching with Hanno.] Therefore, Hannoâ Since what we want is soldiers, soldiers ever, Against the enemy's o'erwhelming forceâ So it may double, and not triple oursâ To Bruttium thou shalt march without delay, Gather in all our garrisons there, ransack Each corner for new levies, then return And meet me on the border. I myself Will lead the new force to Apulia. There, I spend such interval as Hasdrubal May leave me, in providing corn and stores For that which is before me. Hanno. Whatsoe'er Is left in Bruttium, fit to serve thy purpose, Trust me I'll find and safely bring to thee. Adh. Maharbal looks most gloomy. Han. Much I would That we were galloping to the charge together Against an enemy three times our number, For then I think that we should see him smile. Mah. Would that we were! would to the gods we were! Han. We will, then, soon as Hasdrubal shall deign To send me word which road he marches by. Mah. And that will beâhow canst thou doubt? Oh, save us! Here's thy philosopher again. I must not Intrude my soldierly discourse on him. Re-enter Silanus. Han. Thou couldst not have an apter auditor, For he is deep in military tactics, And knows by heart our battles, though not given To interrupt his ease by joining them. Sil. No, verily! I never prized so much My philosophic privilege, as when I watched the field of CannÃ¦; yet I think That I can tell the story to the world, As well as some that fought there. Now I pray Give ear to a petition that I bring thee From this despairing beauty. She implores To see her lover once before he dies. Han. 'Twere merciful to him I should refuse herâ Yet let her have her will. Here, take this ring; The guard will let thee in. Thou know'st the way. [Exeunt omnes. Scene V. âCarthage. An apartment in the house of Sophonisba's father. Sophonisba alone. Enter Gisco. Gis. Well, niece of mine, what cheer, this summer's morn? How, the book dropped? Th'embroidery thrown aside? As languidly reposing on your cushions As any listless beauty of them all? Come, I must have some talk with you. Soph. I am ready. Gis. 'Tis on a theme which, by your face, I guess Your thoughts are now engaged withâthis sad news, This luckless battle of your father's. Well, There's no help for it; but, oh, wherefore lost he That field of Silpia? Spain is lost, I tell you, Unless by some bold strokeâBy all the gods! 'Tis strange how, after all, we scarcely seem To prosper long without Hamilcar's sons. Here's Hasdrubal flown off to Italy, And straight Spain falls into the clutch of Scipio! And now our sole dependence is young Mago. Ay, but for him and for his cavalry Your father would not hold his own an hour. A dangerous house it is, this house of Barca, And will subvert our government at home, As surely as it thrives in arms abroad. Well, but there's something else now. You have read Young Masanissa's letter? Is there in it That which displeases you? Speak honestly. Soph. Have you a purpose in these questions, uncle? Gis. A purpose? Ay, and you shall shortly know it. Well, well, I see, without more questioning, The prince's letter has not satisfied you. Nor, to say truth, has his demeanour lately Been less displeasing to our generals. I, too, have heard from Spain, and have in charge, As your director in your father's place, To let you know his wishes in this matter. Soph. Then pray you in brief words to tell me them. Gis. Why, 'tis a serious business, and concerns The interests of the State. When you were pledged To the Numidian prince, 'twas to secure To Carthage, as we thought, the usefullest Of all th'alliances that Afric offeredâ A boy of promise, trained amongst ourselves, Heir to a mighty chieftainship, and son To our best friend, our sage and faithful Gala. But, look you, he is somewhat changed since then! He is no more in Spain the fervent friend He seemed in Carthage, smiled upon by you. Soph. He was then what he seemed. Gis. If it so please you, What he is now, I think, concerns us more! Oh, we have not forgotten the old story, The pretty history of your childish loves, When you two mounted, on one elephant, Day after day, would pace the city streetsâ And how you whispered in your father's ear, Once, e'er he sailed for Spain, that Massanissa Had promised to take Rome. You think, forsooth, He is still the humble bondslave of your charms, As much as in those days when idle youth Is all for love and such poetic folly. Not so; he knows the world a little better, Since he has led his father's troops, and seen What war and Rome are, and has felt himself Almost a king, too. Oh! I promise you His thoughts are busier counting future chances, Than ever they have been with your sweet face, And your sweet words, which you think so prevailing. Now, mind you, his old father's throne will soon Be vacant, and this youth be in his place. But he's not staunch, no, no, he is not staunch; He is not worthy of you, Sophonisba; He wavers in his faith as he grows older, And, who knows, yet may turn to Rome? Soph. All this, Though you may think it, is not news to me. But to the point. Gis. Oh! the caprice of woman! I looked to have a storm of tears and anger; But you've a cool head, girl, a right cool head, Not the weak heart I gave you credit for. But to the point, then, touching Massanissa. Affairs stand thus: your father has sent word The prince will very soon be with us here, In quest of reinforcements. You will see him, And be it then your business, if you love him, To fix him to yourself and to our cause. If it shall seem hereafter you have failed, Then hold yourself prepared to wed instead His rival Syphax, who already shows Some signs of willingness to break with Rome, And whom we judge the promise of your hand Would make ours wholly. Do you listen, niece? Soph. Yes, I have heard you, and weighed all your words. You need not fear but I will do my best For Carthage. You may tell my father so. As for my own heart's happiness, to speak Or think of that, I know were but a jest In me, a statesman's and a general's daughter. When, think you, we may look to see the prince? Cis. He may arrive in Carthage any day. So now I take my leave. Fair niece, good bye. [Exit Gisco; enter Ada by another door. Ada. May I come in? Soph. Yes, I am all alone. Ada. I am so restless now, till I can find Some one to feel as I do! All the others Laugh onlyâyou are serious. Soph. Nay, I think You can laugh sometimes too. Ada. It is so hard Always to want more news! All night I dream That Hannibal and Hasdrubal have met, And Rome has fallen. Soph. Haply 'twill come true. Ada. Oh! then, at last, we shall see Hannibal, And he will see his Carthage. Do you not Picture him so unlike all other men, That, stood he here this moment unannounced, The very children would shout Hannibal? Soph. 'Twill be a glorious moment. Ada. Dearest cousin, I weary you; you look so grave and sad. Soph. I did not mean to seem so. Ada. Do you know, Whene'er you look as now, I cannot choose But fancy such a grave pathetic grace With a half sadness shadows o'er your beauty, As haply, rescued from the halls of Dis, Still hovered o'er Persephone's sweet brow When mounting into sunlight? Soph. How your thoughts Run wild with poetry, my little cousin! Re-enter Gisco hastily. Gis. Come, guess what news I bring! Soph. How can I, uncle? Gis. You guess, though! But what need to turn so pale? Ay, he's in port; you'll see him in an hour. Remember what we talked about! Come, Ada, Leave her alone to think her lesson over. [Exeunt Gisco and Ada. Scene VI. âA colonnade round the court of the same house. Enter Sophonisba and Massanissa. Soph. And are we, then, so altered? Shall we pace For ever through the twilight without speaking? I had so many things to say to you, And now has your short visit reached its close, And yet we scarce seem to have talked together. Mas. You scarcely can expect a cheerful face, After so signal a defeat as ours. Soph. And yet your nature was more hopeful once. You said you twice had caught a glimpse of Scipio At Silpia. Did the sight of him fulfil Your high-wrought expectation? Mas. How could that be? 'Twas but a moment, and I scarcely saw him. What's Scipio to me? Soph. Do you, then, forget All you have told me of the glowing pictures The young Massiva painted of his captor, And of your longing dream to meet with him? Mas. Ay, all our generals are fools to him; We've not his match in Spain since Hasdrubal. Soph. You speak most gloomily. And do you, then, Wholly despair of our affairs in Spain? Mas. To you, a woman living here at ease, 'Tis vain to speak of war's perplexities And changes. You could never understand them. Soph. And have I, then, no interest in my country? And have I, then, no interest in your fortunes? Oh, Massanissa, you are changed, most changed! The ambition growing in your soul so fast Will swallow up your love. Too true I feel it, Our days of childhood are for ever over. Mas. You speak as though I were forsaking you. Why should you doubt me? Soph. Ah! I had so many, So many things to say to youâand now Your gloomy countenance and absent air Chill all I could have uttered into silence. Tell me, if we should never meet again, Would it content you to have parted so? Mas. Why should you think we may not meet again? Trust me, I bear in battle a charm'd life. Soph. We still may live, yet never meet againâ You may not die, and yet may die to me. Mas. What mean you by this melancholy tone? You, too, are changedâyou chide me for ambition, Yet 'twas your love, your counsels, taught it me. See, it grows late. I must be gone. Soph. So soon? But we shall meet again ere you leave Carthage? Mas. I must sail earlyâno, I fear we cannot. Our farewell must be now. Soph. Farewell. Mas. Take comfort; For if Hamilcar's sons but do their part, The war will soon be over. Fare thee well Till then, and then no more, my Sophonisba! [Exit. Soph. The history of my life is over now; Whatever may become of me, 'tis over. The arrow has struck home into my heart, And when I pluck it from me I shall die. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âApulia. An ilex-grove surrounding an oracular well and sanctuary of Nemesis. Enter Ianthe dressed in white and wearing a chaplet of roses. Ian. O goddess! in whose sanctuary I've spent These two sad solemn nights, waiting a sign, Let not thine oracle be dumb to me, Let not my watch be fruitless! Pity me! Defraud not this bereaved heart of its hope, Show me the path to vengeance! Let me not Lose all the fruit of this long lonely horror, My desolate and dangerous pilgrimage, Which seems to sever me from humankind! Thou know'st the spirit of my love, all night, With his pale murdered face has haunted me! How changed! how changed! Nor am I more myself. Every familiar circumstance of life Seems visionary, long past, and long done with. In dreams I pray unceasingly to one Who turns unpitying from meâwring my hands. Choke with dry sobs, and wake in trembling horrorâ I dared not hate him, whilst I knelt before him, Awed by a sternness, as of destiny, Rather than human will; but I saw himâ Him! him!âunutterable moment!âstill Loving his murderer almost more than me, Still full of life, and yet a dying man, And that has made me mad! Now, every day, This hatred grows more insupportable, The pangs more maddening of rejected prayer! Therefore I come before thee, unseen Power, And cry for comfort in my misery!â 'Tis misery has made me superstitious! Things that were merely names to me grow real, And with a passionate belief I cling To forms which, in my happier days, were only The ornament and poetry of life. Once more, then, of thy sacred well I'll drink, Once more I'll hope to see the answering sign. [She passes through the grove to the sanctuary within. Enter Gala and Gulussa. Gala. Halt we a moment, brother. Gul. With good will. This secret shady spot invites a pause. [Dismounts. Gala. Think you that shaggy shepherd was trustworthy? By the broad sudden grin of his white teeth, When we named Hannibal, he seemed to catch The meaning of our broken, blundering questions, And with a right goodwill to point the wayâ Though what he meant by all that flood of speech, I am not sorcerer enough to guess. Gul. The star of Barca's house has scarcely led us So far, to fail us now, when we begin To feel as if our errand were accomplished! Yet 'twas a juggling nightmare at Canusium That snatched our hero from us at the moment We thought our wanderings done. Gala. A goodly land, Well worth the spoiling! My heart burns within me, To think our holiday is come so near, When we shall snatch our portion. Blessed trump, Whose magic war-blast from the desert charmed us To the war-tents of heroes! Flourish long The race of Barca! Whilst a man of them Is left alive, there will be war on earth. Gul. Meanwhile, he flies before us, like the ghosts That cheat unwary mortals to their doom. And yet, methinks, we carry through the land A talisman that hides us from all foes. Gala. Our talisman's a sharp Numidian wit, And well hath served us, but if Hannibal Eludes us still, may fail to save our skins. What we have gone through, told at home, will sound, Some moonlit eve beneath our desert-palms, Like the wild wonders of the story-tellers. They lead us a hard life, these sons of Barca! But what of that? Come, let's be going! Gala. Stay! This way he pointed us to Metapontumâ In that direction, if I understood him, We should be tending towards Tarentum, where We should fall in with Roman Claudius. Gul. Harken! Mine eyes and ears, methinks, are good as thine, And mine did surely, from his words and signs, Gather that this way lay the path for us, To Metapontum and to Hannibal, And that way lay Tarentum. Gala. Here's a strait. [Ianthe, issuing from the grove, perceives the Numidians, and starts back.] Ian. O goddess, save me! Why left I my home? They see me notâsome voluble dispute Absorbs them. What's their errand here? How came they So near the Roman lines? Hark! I can catch The words âTarentum,â âMetapontum,â ever Bandied between themâpointing now this way, Now that: they have missed their road. O Nemesis! A thrill runs through me! Can this be the sign I seek forâthis, my opportunity? How dare I use it? How dare show myself? Would I could understand their barbarous jargon! Full oft these wild Numidians have been charged With weighty errands by their generalsâ They see me notâI'll draw a little nearerâ Gala. Ha, look!âLook there! Gul. The rose-crowned goddess! oh, Astarte! Gala. Hush! [They prostrate themselves before her.] Ian. [to herself.] What shall I do, O heaven? What do they take me for? Gul. O goddess, speak! See, see our sacred mission! [showing the letter.] Be not wroth! Guide us to Hannibal! to Hannibal! [Ianthe points towards Tarentum. Gala and Gulussa rise, mount, and exeunt.] Ian. 'Twas Nemesis inspired me! How I tremble! There's something whispers me my prayer is heard, And Mutines avenged. How felt I else So brave, when those wild forms fell down before me? How, suddenly, as by a flash of light, Beheld the part appointed meâthe snare I was to send them to? Is it no fancy? Have I, indeed, wrought evil to that man, Or has a childish hope deluded me? How can the loss of two Numidians harm him? O goddess, calm the tremblings of this horror! Brighten the blackness of my loneliness! I see no comfort, none, in all the world. I shudder, thinking I have harmed a man Whose greatness makes my love seem pitiful, My vengeance, profanation. Wretch that I am! Oh, if I cannot hate, what have I left? Would I were home, and all the past forgot! [Exit Ianthe. Scene II. âApulia. The camp of Nero at Venusia. Nero in his tent. Enter an Interpreter. Nero. Here is the letter. Read it me in Latin, If these strange signs contain, indeed, a meaning. Inter. 'Tis writ in Carthaginian, I perceive. Nero. That much I guessed. But let me know who wrote it. Inter. 'Tis writ by Hasdrubal to Hannibal. Nero. I thank thee, Jove! Read on. Inter. With your permission, O Nero, I will study it awhile. [Reads.] Nero. Thou readest slowly; but I pardon thee, So thou shalt find the meaning out at last. Inter. It scarcely can be mastered at a glance. So different are the souls of Rome and Carthage, The very order of these written lines Mechanically expresses to the eye The order of their thoughts, as contrary To ours as right is contrary to left. Nero. Methinks a general writing on his business, All the world over, writes it but one wayâ And that's the shortest. Nathless, take thy time. Inter. [Reads.] I have mastered the contents, most noble Nero, And they are at your service. Nero. Read them. Inter. Thus then: âMy brother, know that Placentia having closed its gates upon me, and I having no artillery wherewith to beat down its walls, I have stayed before them only till the Cisalpine Gauls, and Ligurians, who are well disposed towards me, could join my standard. Tomorrow morning I shall march by the Ãmilian road to Ariminum. Let us then meet in Umbria, and march together by the Flaminian road to Rome. Livius is at Sena; but do thou dispose of Nero, and then let Livius do his worst. I could say much more; but, my brother, let this suffice, till the gods and our good swords bring us face to face. Farewell.â Nero. Write this in Latin. Inter. [Writes.] It is written, Nero. Nero. Now, pray you leave me. [Exit Interpreter. Hasdrubal, methinks, It was thine evil genius penned this letter; And thou shalt own it, for this day I've found The great occasion the stars send but once, And on the instant am inspired to use it. Enter Catius. Come, Catius, canst thou guess who wrote this letter? Cat. The characters are surely Carthaginian. Nero. Know, then, the pen of Hasdrubal himself Traced every line of it. Here's the translation. Read that and tell me what thou think'st of it. Cat. I think the meeting that he talks of here, Will never be whilst Claudius Nero breathes. Nero. Right, Catius. Know'st thou how I got this letter? Two wild Numidian horsemen, hastening straight From Hasdrubal in search of Hannibal, Sought him, so we conceive, first at Canusium, Whilst he the while was hurrying on his errand Of devil's mischief to the Bruttian border; Then following his traces farther south, Just as their errand was almost fulfilled, Are taken in a god-provided snare; For, straying from their road, too near Tarentum, Some foragers of Quintus Claudius seized them, And, spite of their resistance, got this letter, Not without cost of bloodshed, be you sure. He sent it with the prisoners on to me, And I have done my best to wring from them What more of information they possessed, But vainlyâtorture could not wrench a word From their clenched teeth, and so they died in silence. Cat. Nero, this luck is from the gods indeed. I cannot think less than that Rome's salvation Hangs on this day's events, as thou shalt use them. Nero. Ay, Catius, I already have devised A means to part this desperate pair for ever. This very day I write unto the senate, With urgent requisition for fresh leviesâ Wherever there are hands to wield a weaponâ Against the advancing force of Hasdrubal, And counsel to send forward the home legions To hold the pass of Narnia 'gainst his coming. Meanwhile myself will secretly set forth With a picked force, so soon as falls the night, And march for life and death to Livius' camp At Sena. Thence, I think, thou'lt hear of me. Ay, and this conqueror here shall hear of me, E'en whilst he waits for what shall never comeâ A summons from his brother to the Capitol. Cat. Nero, thy plan is masterly conceived, And from my soul I envy thee the deed. Nero. And now to business. What I write to-day, With hope shall fever Rome's great heart at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. âApulia. The camp of Hannibal at Canusium. Enter Hannibal, going the round of the camp, accompanied by Silanus. Bruttian Soldiers, round a fire, are watching a Magician. Han. [Pauses.] Hark! 'tis the murmur of the Aufidus. Sil. Still heard across the murmur of the camp; A music echoing from the Apennines, Which lonely Vultur lifts his fierce old head To listen for, as it goes clamouring byâ Much softened from its angry winter-roar, But yet unsilenced by the summer sun. Thou'lt be far hence e'er then, we'll humbly trust; Ere these wide pastures wear the tawny tint Of CannÃ¦'s burning August, and yon stream Shall lazily unwind along the plain A tiny silver thread, may we not hope, With a new CannÃ¦ thou'lt be busy elsewhere? Who knows what deeds thy Hasdrubal e'en now Is adding to the sum of your renowns, Whilst we, far off, can catch no sound of them? Han. Far off, yet never have I felt him closer. Sil. Happy for Carthage that in you she sees, In glaring breach of one of earth's pet laws, The rare descent of a great father's soul, Not merely to one sonâand that's scarce seenâ But to a pair of themânay, I'll say three; For Mago has in him the fire divine, By tokens unmistakeable, though as yet The sparkles break irregularly forth. Han. We were all like each other from our childhood; But Hasdrubal, the next to me in age, Was more entirely one with me in spirit. A separate influence has been still at work, From early youth, on Mago's troubled soul, Perplexing much his course of action, and Clouding the sunshine of his best successes. Sil. Thou mean'st his hopeless love for Sophonisba, That bride betrothed, and beauty, from her cradle. I never held with him an intercourse So close as with thyself and Hasdrubal, So often was he absent then from Spain; Yet, knowing of his history, have watched, With somewhat of a curious sympathy, The outward workings of that passionate dream, O'er which he brooded then, and still broods now, With obstinate and unconsoled devotionâ How the boy's worship of the queenly child Became the youth's heroic inspiration, And, last, th'accustomed yoke of man's despair. Han. That love has followed him like his evil genius; But pass it will, and I shall once more welcome Home to my heart the Mago of my youth, The same who crossed the Alps so gaily with meâ The same who burst at Trebia on the rout Of Rome's astounded legion, like their doomâ The same who hastened with such happy zeal To bear the news of CannÃ¦ home to Carthage; But, noble as he is, and ever must be, An influence, one like Sophonisba's father, Could ne'er have exercised on such as Mago, But for this fatal spell, has hitherto Cramped his fierce energies, and fretted sore The finer part of his heroic nature. Far elsewise has it been with Hasdrubal, The singleness of whose career and aims Kept pace in Spain with mine in Italy, And formed as close a tie betwixt our souls, As that betwixt the lightning and the thunder. Sil. To my mind's eye you picture such a group As I behold in yonder pines, which spread, The same in form and hue, their sombre tops Across white clouds, and yellow moon new-risen, Like Titans lifting up their iron shieldsâ Three of them, but the third one bends apartâ Lo! as I live, the wonderful Egyptian, The newest mystery of Metapontum! See there! The soldiers with their eager eyes Devour his awful countenance. What brings The honour of his presence to thy camp? Han. Watch we awhile what passes. For the moment They see me not, they are so rapt in him. A Sold. This laughing lad here, he will serve thy purpose. He's a sharp-witted Greek, fresh from Crotona. Come forward, Hieroâdo what he bids thee. Mag. Be not afraid, there's nothing here to harm thee. Hold forth thy hand; see, I let fall therein The magic ink-drop. All is ready now. What he sees there, let him describe to you. But, first, whose portrait do you ask of me? Living or dead, this lad shall look upon him. Another Sold. Let it be Hasdrubal. He is the man We look for, and we talk of, day and night. Mag. Look in the ink, and tell us what thou seest. Boy. I see a brush, without a hand to hold it, Sweeping the ground. It disappears, and now I see a crowd of tents, and flags, and men On foot and horseback. Some are dressed in white And scarlet. 2nd Sold. Ay, the Spanish infantry. He'll bring us thousands more of them from Spain. Boy. And here are some Numidians swarming in; They dart on their swift horses to and fro, Like flights of dark birds hovering o'er the plain, And throwing forth their spears as if for sport, And some, long-haired and fair-faced, like our Gauls, Are drinking, and some sleeping. 3rd Sold. Villains all! That I'll be sworn they are. But what comes next? And where is Hasdrubal? Mag. Whisper down to them, âMy master greets you well, and bids you bring The Punic Hasdrubal, Hamilcar's son, Into his magic mirror.â Boy. Here he is! This must be he! On a tall horse he comes, And slowly rides towards me. Now he turns And speaks to some oneânow he points his hand As to a distant objectânow I see His features plainly. Why, 'tis Hannibal! No, there's a difference. 3rd Sold. What, then, is he like? Describe him to us. Boy. He is tall, like him, Yet somewhat slightlier builtâa comely head, And yet 'tis less majestic than my lord'sâ And yet I know not, but he carries it With a more fierce and glowing eagernessâ Swarthy, like him, but a more burning brown. When he turns sideways, then he seems less like. Sil. [Aside to Hannibal.] 'Tis true, the portrait is exact, so far. 4th Sold. Come, tell us more. Boy. He knits his straight black browsâ His eyes keep flashing, now this way, now that. He watches somethingâoh, it grows so dark! I see no more. Mag. Wait. Light will soon appear. Boy. Yes, now a red streak burns along the sky, And light falls on his figure standing still. Oh, now he turns! He looks so sad and fierce, And seems to listen gloomily. He smiles! A strange and sudden smile like Hannibal's. Sil. That's a true touch too. 1st Sold. Ay, that looks like battle. Boy. Now all's confusion. I discern no more The form of Hasdrubal. What does it mean? There seems a sort of mist, and fighting shadows Gliding within itâforms like elephants Seem to rush heavily on every side, Trampling down all before them. Horrible! 5th Sold. Come, foolish lad! If thus thou shudderest To watch a mimic battle, how wouldst feel Were it a real one? Boy. Now 'tis clear again. Now I see nothing but a warrior stretched Along the ground, whose face is hidden from me, And by him gazing stand two grave, stern men, Each wearing scarlet cloaks above their armour. 5th Sold. Why, those are Roman generals. By the gods! This fellow has a mind to frighten us With his mysterious pictures. Look again, And tell us if thou now discern'st the face. Boy. Noâall is vanished. Is there nothing more? Mag. This spectacle is finished. Thou mayst raise Thine eyes again. Soldiers. [Clamouring together.] Hast thou come here to mock us?â What mean'st thou by thy lying drop of ink?â Interpret this, thou juggling greybeard, straightway, Or limb from limb we'll rend thee!âDost thou dare To mock us to our faces? Mag. Know you not, That I myself pretend not to explain The meaning of the visions that I show, By the fixed laws of my world-ancient art? These things are secrets into which my skill Strives not to penetrate. My hand puts forth Its cunning, with mechanical obedience To those few simple rules my master taught me, But why th'effects should follow that you see, My understanding can no more conceive, Than of the other mysteries of nature, Such as the growth of seed to flower and fruit, Or life and death itself, greatest of all. Doubtless there have been men whose mighty minds Pierced deeper through these wonders than mine own, And by their knowledge, ignorantly thus I profit; more than this I cannot tell you. Sold. Tear him in pieces! Trample him under foot! Han. [Advancing.] Nay, touch him not! What mischief can he do, Forsooth, to you, or me, or Hasdrubal, By the faint image in a drop of ink? I bid you keep him a safe prisoner, Till such time as our Hasdrubal himself Shall come to read this mighty riddle for us, And laugh at your perplexities. Fear nothing; He cannot harm you, therefore harm him not. [The Soldiers relinquish their hold of the Magician, and return to their places.] Sil. Thou art not superstitious, Hannibal, Else wouldst thou vex thyself to penetrate The meaning of this cunning mystery. Han. Nay, I reserve myself to question him At mine own time, if he perchance have gathered Some floating rumour that may prove half true, Some hint of Hasdrubal's still unguessed movements, That may concern me somewhat. For the rest, Too urgent and too human is life's business To wait on signs and omens. Sil. And in thee The gods themselves have but a reverent son, Never, I think, a slave. Han. If dread be slavish. Sil. Yet brave must be the faith which can embrace, Serenely, the conception of those terrors Wherewith the ritual of your Syrian worship Still shrouds, to earthly eyes, the powers divineâ Though shorn of its old favourite ornament, The human sacrifice. Your faith, it seems, Finds there no menace, but an inspiration, Enduring and sustaining to the last. Han. I know not if the gloomy soul of Carthage Hath figured deity aright; for me, I am what the religion of my youth Has made me. Though its form, perhaps, be changed, The passion of its loyalty gone by, Its purpose and devotion are the same. I hear the gods' voice in my heart alone, Nor seek a sign from heaven, save that which came Betimes to me, as still it comes to all Who follow the first whisper of their genius; A few steps forward in a perfect faith, And then a strong wind lifts the spirit up, And bears us on with twice our human speedâ 'Tis we no moreâit is the deity. And if at times there falls upon the soul That's so possessed, a shadow of great sadness, An awful lonely consciousness of power, We feel but more assured the god is with us. Some, doubtless, have fallen headlong from such heights Dizzied as by the mighty eagle-wings That flap around the solitary head Of some bewildered climber of the Alps. But no such fiend hath yet assailed my soul. Sil. My brain can comprehend and can admire This the fanatic passion of your being; My heart meanwhile is coldâso paralyzed To such emotions, earthly science holds No medicine to revivify its powers. Such as I am, I am content to be, Nor would have others like me. What you are, With something of the artist's sense I see, Who copies with his pencil, not his actionsâ But since you stray not after signs and omens, Tell me what found you on the haunted shore Of the ne'er-fathomed, sad Campanian lake, When you did homage to th'infernal gods, Above the very kingdom of the dead? What saw, what found you, other than you soughtâ A politic mask to hide your purposed spring At near Puteoli? Han. When I returned To the blue sky and sun, as back to life, I came from such communion with the dead, As nature offers us in chosen hours And chosen places; and that circle gray Hollowed deep in the voice-subduing shade Of forest-blackened hills, by fires that now Are known but through the cinders of the past, Was to my spirit even as a gate, Out of the pent-up prison of this life, Into the vastness of the other world, Where fancy moved awhile in awe, not fear. Sil. To those who waited on your sacrifice, You seemed, no doubt, to brave a very host Of venerable terrorsâbirds that drop, Dead from the poisoned airâlamenting criesâ Infernal music from the waters' depths, And stately phantoms pacing through the trees. Doubtless, they questioned, with believing eyes, The mystery that solemnized your brow, And read therein a message from the dead. Han. Now to the quarter of the Gauls. Wilt follow? [Exeunt Hannibal and Silanus. Scene II. âThe camp of Livius at Sena. Livius and Porcius enter the tent of the former. Por. Already his approach may be expected. It was well thought of by you to delay His entrance to us till the fall of night. Liv. Ay, Hasdrubal has cunning eyes, no doubt, To see what passes, but mayhap we'll cheat them. Por. His speedy march seems like a miracle. Liv. Oh, he can stride apace to win from me My portion in the honour of this war. But welcome, so we get to fight the quicker. I've been content, for Rome's sake, to be patient. Now Nero comes to hurry my slow age, And set me tasks with his superior wisdom. Por. Wise, or not wise, his stars have sent him luck; Shame on him, had he failed to use it well. Enter an Officer. Off. My lord, I bring you news, the consul Nero Is entering now the camp. Liv. Porcius, go you And fetch him with due welcome to my tent. [Exit Porcius. So, so! and we two are to meet, it seems, In friendly counsel, eat at the same board, Fight side by side in battle like two brothers! I thought not once to meet so lovingly, But lo! it never is too late to learn. Old as I am, I have mended my ill manners. Re-enter Porcius with Nero. I greet thee, Nero. Nero. Thanks. Thy soldiers, Livius, Are, doubtless, ready to take these of mine To their own tents, as we before agreed on? Liv. Ay, all has been arranged. Nero. As yet, I trust, Our secret must be safe from Hasdrubal. Por. And Hannibal? Nero. All safe there, as I think. Liv. I pray you eat and drink. Nero. 'Twere well I should; Yet I've nor thirst nor hunger, save for battle. Por. Thou shalt have that as well. Say, didst thou find The country well affected on thy road? Nero. Ay, truly; I may call my hasty march A seven days' triumph. All along the way The country-folk poured forth as I did pass, With prayers for my success; altars were reared, And victims sacrificed for us in haste; Food was set forth on tables by the road, Whereof the soldiers, eager as myself, Ate not save standing; vehicles were there, Ready to bear the weary; all I asked, I got in double measure; aged men, Beyond the years of soldier's serviceâyouths, Not yet grown up to themâbesought, with tears, Leave to march with me. One determined hate Of the invader breathed where'er I came. Liv. Oh, trust them, they forget not Hannibal's march, Infernal pest! along that very road, And burn, I dare be sworn, to pay old scores, Written, these ten years back, in blood and flame. For those that love him, let them look to it! There's a rod ready now for traitors. Nero. Ay, That will come after. Now then, let us frame Our scheme of battle. What though, for the moment, The foe guess not our numbers, since thy tents Lodge all my men, we must not leave him time To find our secret out. Liv. Howe'er that be, Some few days' rest both man and horse must have Before the battle. Nero. Livius, I say, No. Por. O Nero, be persuaded in this matter! For think what issue hangs upon the field Thou art so eager for. The State must fall Past all redemption, if this time we fail. Let us be careful of our single chance. Thy men have been o'ertasked past human strength,â His, fresh and flushed with bygone victories. A few days' rest, and thenâfight whom thou wilt. Nero. Porcius, methinks thou hast forgotten whom We leave behindâone who has eyes and ears That reach the very centre of our campsâ One whose horse-hoofs are winged like Mercuryâ Who, haply, even now is on our pathâ For who shall rest at leisure, in the hope He has found how to outwit Hannibal? One hope we haveâto conquer Hasdrubal Ere Hannibal be on us. Now is the time. Our force is double his; and he, besides, Is wanting in that matchless cavalry At which all Italy has learnt to tremble. When shall we find an hour more full of hope For ending, at one blow, the mighty peril Wherein we stand? My men desire no restâ They will not rest till Hasdrubal be conquered. Once moreâthink well, before you answer, who, With all his thousands, hovers on the wing, From morn till eve, whilst we are loitering here. Por. I yield, O Nero! What doth Livius say? Liv. Do as you will, arrange you your own schemeâ If ruin comes, I wash my hands of it. Por. When wilt thou have us fight? Nero. To-morrow morn. Por. Nay, nay, a little respite! Nero. Livius, speak. Liv. I say, do as you will. Nero. To-morrow morn, then, Let the red ensign fly. Por. Then, by the gods, Nero, do thou snatch what repose thou mayst In that short interval thou leav'st thyself! Nero. I will; but first must see to my tired soldiers; They shall not think I have forgotten them. [Exeunt Nero, Livius, and Porcius. Scene III. âThe Carthaginian and Roman armies drawn out in order of battle. Enter Hasdrubal and Carthalo, on horseback, to reconnoitre. Hasd. Now, by Astarte! do I dream, Carthalo? Does it not seem, as thou dost look on them, The enemy is much increased in numbers? Carth. Yea, truly, if mine eyes deceive me not, 'Tis even soâincreased, both horse and foot. Hasd. Those horses, tooâseest thou how thin they seem? I cannot doubt but they have travelled far. Something is brewing that I understand not. Carth. There's something strange here, trulyâ Hasd. Well, Carthalo, I may not venture, if thus overmatched, To give them battle now. I will withdraw, And after send some horsemen to ride round And read this riddle. Come, let us turn bridle. [Exeunt Hasdrubal and Carthalo. Scene IV. âThe Camp of Hasdrubal. Hasdrubal, Carthalo, and Numidians. Hasd. You saw, then, no enlargement of their camp? No fresh tents reared? A Numid. My lord, all was the same As heretofore. One only sign we had That some unusual thing had happened thereâ For we did note, that whilst the trumpets blew, As formerly, a single summons in The prÃ¦tor's quarter, it was sounded twice Where Livius lay. Hasd. Enough; all is now plain. Heard'st thou, Carthalo? Carth. Yea, with pain and wonder. The riddle's solved. The consuls are both hereâ We are much outnumbered. Hasd. Verily we are. A thousand strange misgivings crowd upon me. What has befallen in the south? How is it That Nero has broke loose from Hannibal? And why is he not here? Now, by the gods, Long time may Carthage rue this loitering! Car. I cannot, will not doubt he had good cause; And yet I swear that this delay looks strangely. Hasd. O Hannibal, why, why art thou not here? Well, well, it is but waste time to complain. I have decided. Car. To retreat? Hasd. No less. At nightfall I shall e'en break up my camp, And find my way back to the farther bank Of yonder river. Car. What if they o'ertake thee, And force a battle ere thy brother join thee? Thou wilt fight then at greater disadvantage; For these barbarians are disheartened ever, And grow unruly, oft as they retreat. Hasd. I must not fight the consuls nowâ'tis vain. Ill-omened, thrice ill-omened this delay! He that was wont to come ere called! The foe, Far off, scarce dared to breathe his name in whispers; The nymphs of the most secret Apennines Knew never when to look for himâofttimes Their sleep, when they did dream him far away, Was startled by the thunder of his coming; The guardian gods of Rome before their gates Sit ever watching for his horsemen's tread; And now he tarries, when the fate of Rome Hangs on his speed! Car. 'Tis much unlike himself. We never looked for this, when first we left Placentia's walls, flushed with the coming hour. Some evil chanceâ Hasd. What evil chance to him Who lords it over chance and destiny? Car. Alas! how have we missed the simple answer To all these questions? They have seized thy letter. Hasd. Yet Gala and Gulussa would pass safe Where sorcery's self would fail. It may be so. And if it be so, I now know the worst. Well, I retreat to-night, and thenâtake patience. [Exeunt Hasdrubal and Carthalo. Scene V. âNightâthe camp of Hasdrubal on the banks of the Metaurus. Enter Hasdrubal, from his tent, to watch the sky. Hasd. When will the morning break? O thou dark cloud, Thou hid'st the destinies of Hasdrubal! Where is the streak of fire which should creep up To crest thy sable helmet, and cast forward Light o'er the waters I must cross so soon? Oh, through the wild gloom of my mournful march, Perplexed, entangled in the dreary woods, How did mine ear, strained through the night's long rain, Oft fancy that it caught thy voice, my brother! What if I never hear it any more? What if Metaurus from this time become A name at which all Carthage shall turn pale? What means this deep farewell that swells my breast? Why does my city of the waters now Rise like a mourning mother through the dark, And look upon me as with streaming eyes? You drunken savages outstretched around me, What are Hamilcar's sons to you, or what Care you if we should never look on Rome? Enter Carthalo. Carth. Is it thou, Hasdrubal? Hasd. Good morrow, friend. Carth. I cannot for the darkness see thy face, And yet I see that thou art sad. Hasd. With cause, For I am farther all these miles from Rome Than I was yesterday. Carth. Thou hast not slept; Thy spirit has not rested from its troubles. Hasd. These fellows here do take their fill of rest. They sleep as they would never wake again. Carth. See, a faint twilight from the dawn steals on; 'Tis time, indeed, that we should find our ford, If we would cross before the consuls reach us. But how to rouse these Gauls from their deep slumber, Drunk as they are with weariness and wine? They heed not now the voice of any man, Not if the enemy were on our camp, Could Hannibal himself compel them forth. Why dost thou draw that ring from off thy finger? What wilt thou do with it? Hasd. I must destroy it, For should there come a battle, and I fall, And should my body in their hands remain, This, mine own signet, stamped on a forged letter, Might ruin Hannibal. Marcellus' death Has taught that lesson to me. Carth. Hasdrubal, Why will you talk thus? Hasd. Think not I despair, But, cut off thus from my allies and friends, By overpowering numbers, 'tis my part To make provision for all casualties. I will not trust to any hiding-place For this so dangerous and priceless treasure. When in the Spanish wars my father fell, I, but a lad then, drew from his dead hand This signet-ring, and placed it on my own. Long have I worn it, but the time has come When I must stamp it, with this heel of mine, Into as many atoms as I would Stamp down the walls of Rome. One little momentâ One moment more, and it is gone for ever. Carth. I grieve that thou shouldst do thisâyet, perhaps, 'Twere best to do so. Hasd. Relic of Hamilcar! Never be thou corrupted to the use Of the accursed race! Ring that his son Has worn through years of warfare, never seal My Hannibal's destruction! [Stamps upon it.] Carth. Oh, my friend, Be this no omen of thy fate, or his. Hasd. Ha, the day breaks at last! The dawn! the dawn! Now for our marchâlet us but find at last The ford we have missed so long. [Trumpets sound, and the camp begins to stir.] Carth. Would those brute Gauls Wake from their drunken sleep! Hasd. Come, then, Carthalo! Carth. Hear'st thou? Here comes a breathless messenger. Enter a Numidian Horseman. Num. My lord, the enemy is come in sight. His cavalry is gaining fast upon us. Hasd. To battle, thenâno other choice remains. At least the Spanish Foot and the Ligurians Are fit for fight; and even of these Gauls Some even now are rousing them from sleep. And if we winâwhy, then we need no ford. Carth. And if we lose this day, may I not live, Son of Hamilcar! to behold another, But perish like a soldier by thy side. Hasd. The purple clouds array themselves in haste, With dreadful glory, like two armies fighting.â Bid trumpets blow, and let us try our luck. [Exeunt Hasdrubal and Carthalo. Scene VI. âThe field of battle. Enter Hasdrubal, Carthalo, and others, on horseback, surrounded by the Romans. Hasd. Oh, come, my friends! there is no more to do; 'Tis time to give our last, our lives, for Carthage. Carth. I cannot wish to die a nobler death. [They spur their horses into the midst of the enemy.] Scene VII. âThe Forum of Rome, crowded with Citizens. Enter a Woman and Child. Wom. I heard a distant shout. Oh, tell me, friend, Have any tidings come? A Cit. Nay, nothing yet. Child. But why is all this crowd gathered here, mother? Wom. My child, we wait to know if the great gods Have deigned to save the city. Know'st thou not The Consuls are in Umbria with their armies, Fighting the Carthaginian Hasdrubal? Child. Oh, yes, my father told me when he went. But shall we know to-day which has won, mother? And shall we see my father? Wom. Ah, my child, I cannot tell thee if we e'er shall see him. A Cit. Just such a crowd as this beset the streets Waiting for news from CannÃ¦. And who knows But a like tale may come this day to us? Wom. For mercy, hush! Thou mak'st me think I see Those wild Numidians coming in their fury. At every sound I quake, and think they're here. Child. Who are they, mother? Wom. Men more fierce than wolves! Ere thou wast born, these eyes of mine have seen them By hundreds, ay, with Hannibal at their head, Before our very gates. Another Cit. And I myself Was there when Hannibal's own scornful hand Flung in a spear as he rode slowly by. It lighted on the ground just where I stood. Proud man! with what a look he gazed upon us, As if we all had been his purchased slaves. Another. Ay, what a time was that! It seems to me But yesterday we saw those savages Come trooping down with their long hair all loose, All on their bridleless, unsaddled steeds, Settling in swarms, here, there, and everywhere, Filling all heaven with their infernal cries, And all the land with desolating flames. And lo, again, another Hannibal Is ready with another swarm of devils To snatch away our harvests. Wom. Hark! oh, hark! [Shouts heard from a distance.] A Cit. That sounds like something. Here they come! Oh, hark! Enter fresh Citizens, with great uproar. Citizens. Good news! Good news! Another Cit. What is it? Speak, what news? Citizens. Two horsemen from the field have ridden home To Narnia, with the tidings of a victory. They talk of nothing else in all the camp there. [The crowd shouts.] A Cit. Jove, can this be so? Another. No, no, 'tis too good. I dare not to believe it. Another. Lies and folly! How should a battle fought so far in Umbria Be heard of two days afterwards in Rome? Enter fresh Citizens, shouting. What news? What news? Citizens. A letter has arrived From Lucius Manlius himself, at Narnia, Confirming the first tidings. Other Cit. No! no! no! We'll not believe this till the consuls tell us. [Fresh shouts are heard.] Cit. [shouting] Make way! make way! Room for three officers Come from the Consuls straight with a despatch. All [shouting] Thank the great gods! A Cit. They will be here, e'en now. As far as to the Milvian Bridge the way Is lined with faces. Scarce a mouse could find Room to creep through them. Enter fresh Citizens, with uproar. Cit. Make way! make way! Enter Veturius, Lucinius, and Metellus. Vet. People of Rome! We bid you thank the gods For a great victory. Make way, there! We must On to the Senate. A Cit. In the name of heaven, I pray you tell us more! Lic. Make way, good people. It is our duty first to seek the Senate. Hands off, I pray you! Another. Are both Consuls safe? Met. Both safe. Make way! Another. Our legions? Vet. Will return Unbroken. Let me pass! Another. One moment! Tell us If Hasdrubal is taken? Met. He is slain! [Loud and prolonged shouts.] [Exeunt Veturius, Licinius, and Metellus. Cit. Let's in to the Senate after them. Enter Lictors, and force the crowd back. A Cit. Oh, when hath Rome known such a day as this? Another. This wipes out CannÃ¦! Another. When will they come forth? Another. Make way! Make way! They come! Re-enter Veturius. Cit. [shouting.] The letter! the letter! Vet. [mounts the rostrum and reads.] âAll is well. We have won a great battle on the Metaurus. Hasdrubal is slain. His army is cut to pieces. His camp and all its spoils are taken.â [Loud shouts.] There is no more than this that I have read. But will it please you from my lips to hear All that fell out, as mine own eyes beheld it? Cit. Yes, yes! tell us, noble Veturius. Vet. Already have you heard the happy chance, Whereby the letter writ by Hasdrubal Came to the hands of Nero, and what use His noble soul devised to make of it. Know, then, the morn after his seven days' march Had brought him safely to the camp of Livius The Consul led us forth to the attack; But then, it seemed, for the first time the foe Guessed at our secret; for he turned again To his own camp, and, at the fall of nightâ As we discovered shortlyâstole away, And back to the Metaurus urged his march, Seeking, as since we know, a ford to cross by, But ever baffled by the rocky walls That close it in, and in the dark of night, Further bewildered by his faithless guides, Who easily escaped him at his need. Long through the woods his windings did we trace, And high, I promise you, our hearts were beating, As we marched after. Mile for mile we followed, And at the day-dawn we came up with him; 'Twas then began a fight that matches CannÃ¦. Cit. Proceed, proceed! Vet. We found him camped upon the river's bank, His menâscarce rested from their weary march, The last they were to makeâbut just astir To seek the ford they never were to find. Forth at the first alarm he drew to meet us, Deepening his lines within the narrow space, And at their head his ten huge elephants. Our left was led by Livius; on our right Nero opposed the Gauls, scarce sobered from Their night's carousals. Porcius led the centre. For Hasdrubal, he, with his Spanish foot, Confronted Livius. Then the contest closed. Full soon the elephants, sent wild with wounds, Dashed madly through our ranks, and through the foe's As madly, and on either side alike Upset and trampled horse and infantry. Give me fair fight with men! These frantic beasts Lend battle a worse horror than man's rage. Long fought we as men never fought before, Nor lost, nor gained the while, an inch of ground, Till Nero, hopeless to prevail in frontâ Where, shielded by the river on their left, Stood, on ground unapproachable, the Gaulsâ Dealt at the last the death-blow of the foe; For, stealing round our rear, all on a sudden, Down fell he like a thunderbolt of Jove Upon the right flank of the enemy. There, with his Spanish foot, as brave a band Of desperate men as ever stood the brunt Of an unequal strife, fought Hasdrubal; But fought in vain. Hemmed in on every side, He saw that all was lost, but to the last Strong in th'immortal energy of hate That burns through all Hamilcar's lion brood, Myself, I saw him give his horse the spur, And burst in on us at one furious bound, Frowning from the black shadow of his helm The last defiance of despair upon us. Thus he, at head of a devoted few, Died fighting, as became Hamilcar's son, And Hannibal's own brother. [Loud shouts from the crowd. Veturius pauses.] Cit. Proceed, proceed! Finish thy tale. Vet. Thus perished Hasdrubal. Yet how he fell I saw not. O'er him rolled the battle-sea, And buried his tall horse, and dark fixed face, One moment seen and lost, amongst our spears. So ceased a mighty battle. On that day The blood of tens of thousands clogged our swords, Till we were weary with the toil of slaying. When all was finished on the battle-field, We stormed the camp, and ended there the work Of slaughter, on the brute inebriate Gauls, Still stretched in that inglorious sleep, from whence They woke no more. Rich was the spoil that day; And richly shall it furnish forth the pageant That's yet to come before you. On the field, Six giant corpses of their elephants We found, slain, when they maddened, by their drivers. The rest, one day, shall here be led in triumph. For Hasdrubal, we found his mangled corpse Beneath a heap of slainâa proud revenge For four of Rome's own Consuls. To the hands Of Nero, we delivered his remains. Quirites, I have finished! For the rest, Your countrymen shall tell you all hereafter, When back comes Livius triumphing to Rome. Cit. Away, away, away! Let's to our homes, And tell the story to our wives and children! [The crowd disperses tumultuously.] Scene VIII. âHannibal's Camp at Canusium. Hannibal, Maharbal, Adherbal, &amp;c., at supper in the tent of Adherbal. All [drinking]. To Hasdrubal, and to his swift approach! Adh. Having paid honour to the human friend, Wherefore forget the faithful beasts that love us? Health to the elephants, our best allies! Mah. Amen to that! But how are we the better? We want them, and we have not got them. Ay, Had I my wish now, I'd be choosing out From every stall along the threefold walls The biggest of the idle beasts they keepâ Methinks I see them!âstabled at such cost, Luxurious monstersâjust to mock our need. Han. Right gallant warriors, that deserve their wages! 'Tis not long since that I did beg for some, But they denied me. Mah. Curses on the spite Of faction, thus to thwart thee at each turn! Instead of sending south to scour each mile, 'Twixt Nile and Nigerâoh, I know them well! They're listening now, whilst every fool in council Starts up to chatter 'gainst thy generalship. I would that they who talk so big of warâ Prating of things no soul of them understands, Battles and marches, round their supper-tablesâ Could taste a little of the sweets of fighting! Han. Good souls of Carthage! Let them chatter on, And let them rail too, so they grudge me not My valiant elephants. Mah. Thou smil'st? Fiends catch me, If I see anything at all to laugh at In that which makes you merry! Han. Shall they so? I was but smiling to behold in fancy What thou and I so oft have smiled to seeâ Those martial monsters striding gleefully, With their small twinkling eyes and quivering ears, To send the Roman squadrons, horse and man, Piteously rolling to perdition. Mah. Oh, Of those dumb, cunning creatures, the least wise Is worth whole mobs of Carthaginian idlers, Gaping for news of Italy! Han. Thou think'st so? [rises.] I leave you for my tent, nowâfriends, good night. [Exit. Mah. He puts a good face on it; yet be certain, He's groaning inwardly at this delay Of news from Hasdrubal. Where is he, then? How long are we to fret and fume for him? He has had time to make a flaming beacon Of every village on the road to Rome, And yetâ Adh. And yet we see no conflagration. Mah. Little thou car'st for that! Now I'll be bound Thou'st some Greek love-song running in thy head, This very moment, caught up from some fool In foolish Metapontum! Adh. Even so. I love their love-songs better, I confess, Than fierce old hymns to Moloch, thy delightâ Fit only for some murder-loving priest To howl o'er pretty children in the flames, As in our golden period.âHa! wild Zeba, Galloping towards us in his madcap fashion! Mah. Ay, what new freak now? Enter Zeba, dismounting in front of the tent, and holding in his hand a severed head. Adh. Well, and what of this? Zeba. What of it? Let him answer that, who can! Adh. What is this head to us, then? Why this rage? Zeba. I only know that it was flung to me, Before our outposts, by those dogs of Romansâ And whose it is, I swear I cannot tell. Mah. Nor we, indeedâhaply some luckless wretch, Caught by them, playing spy about their camp. What matter? Zeba. Why then did they clap their hands, And point, and laugh so loudly, as they bade me Go ask of Hannibal, whose head it was? Oh, it shall be my turn to mock these mockers, Some day when I shall roll their grinning skulls, To bleach beneath the broad stare of the sun, When dogs have picked them clean. Adh. Well said, friend Zeba. Let's see this victim's face.âWhy, who art thou?â Some noble Carthaginianâno doubt there. By heaven, I would thou wert alive again! Mah. Look thereâthe soldiers gathering from all sides! Re-enter Hannibal. Han. What's this? Show me that head. Adh. Thou seest, Maharbal. Mah. Ay, we know now. Adh. As well as if the gods Had thundered it from heaven. Mah. They see it, tooâ Look roundâthey see his face as well as we. Adh. How guessed we not? O Hannibal! O Carthage! Han. Adherbal! Adh. Hannibal! Han. Have it in charge, That funeral rites be paid my brother's head, This very night, and I will witness them.â Pale head of Hasdrubal! by this kiss, I pray, So and more also do the gods to me, If I show mercy in the hour of Rome, Till every hair of thine has been avenged, To any living thing that's born of her! Enter Soldiers with Himilco. A Sold. My general! Han. Speak. Sold. The enemy parades Before our camp a crowd of prisoners, boundâ And here is one they have sent in to us. He prays to speak with you. Han. [to Himilco.] Come to my tent. I'll see thee there alone. [Exit, with Himilco. Adh. What means all this? A battle fought!âAnd we!â Mah. It means forsoothâ Oh, may confusion seize you, gods of Carthage, Since this is all that you could do for us!â Am I bewitched, to weep so? Adh. Weep thy heart out! The noblest head, save one, earth ever sawâ O Carthage! Carthage!â Mah. Lies there, like a stone. Zeba. What's my life worth, unless I can avenge thee? Here on the dust before thee, O my lord, I swear to bring the price of thee, one day, To my heart's chief, my king, my only god! [Exit. Adh. You veterans, all of you, whose iron hands Are vainly striving to choke down your sobs, Whose tears are tears of fire that veterans weep, You'll not forget this day till Hannibal Himself shall tell you it is blotted out? All. No, by the gods!âWhen we forget it, may Our right hands wither! Mah. Swear, and swear! and groan Your very souls out! That's what's left to usâ That's what it's come to!âGods! And where is, then, The army this man led? Adh. O thou dead face! Canst thou not tell us? Didst thou whisper it To him thou so didst love, and break his heart In that one horrible moment? Did a fire Flash from thine eyes to meet him? Did a warning Break from thy lips? Dear, glorious, dreadful head! An earthquake shall thy tale to Carthage be!â Lie here, thou wreck, and wait for the vain honours Despairing love shall lavish on dumb dust. [Removes it within.] A Sold. The generals weep like us. Another. Are we but babies? Let's curse the Romans, then! Another. To hell with them!â Saw you his face, the face of Hannibal? Another. His? When shall I not see it? But we'll teach them The head of Hasdrubal's a dangerous plaything! Thousands of heads must pay him for this one! Mah. Well said! But pay him, shall we? Not with millions! [Exit Maharbal. Scene IX. âThe tent of Hannibal. Adherbal, Maharbal, and Himilco. Adh. Tell us, then, how he bore to hear your story? Him. With pale and steadfast countenance he sat, His head supported on his hand, his eyes Fixed on me, till, as I approached the close, And spoke of Hasdrubal, and how he died, He pressed both hands a moment on his face, And his breast heaved; but, when he took them off, I saw no tear. He heard me to the end, But when I ceased, without a word he rose, And to the inner room withdrew himself, And if he wept there, best knows Hasdrubal, Whose shade was surely with him. Adh. So 'tis ended! But how shall soul of man find strength to bear So deep a ruin of so dear a hope? Him. What will he do now? Will his strong heart break, And fling the fate of Carthage to the winds? Or will he keep his dream, that years to come Shall find him once more on the road to Rome? Mah. Ay, that will he! His heart will never break While there's a mischief to be done to Rome. I think he'll not go hence until he dies.â Gods! this is like the days when Capua fell; I was by then, when first he heard the news. Adh. But that great anguish was to this a jest; The fall of Capua was a child's toy broken, Rome's bloody vengeance there a butchery Of lambs, beside the death of Hasdrubal. Enter Hannibal from within. Him. I take my leaveâyou do not need me now. [Exit. Han. Be seated, friends. No need to strive for words,â I know already all that you would say. Well, it is time boldly to face the truth; Hasdrubal and his army are no moreâ My dearest dream is perished. Adh. Hannibal, How noble is thy fortitude! For us, Needs must I own it, we have wept like women. Han. There's cause for tears,âbut now no more of them; We'll speak of what concerns our present actions. I need not say that now, for many a year, All hope of marching to the siege of Rome Must be laid by. Nor can I wage this war As I have done so longâere yet I hoped To end it at a blow. 'Twill be enough If I can hold a spot of Italy Against mine enemies, till time or chance Work some auspicious change. Mah. Ay, let us wait Till Mago o'er the Alps shall come to greet thee! We'll take heed not to miss him. Han. That's a dream. But Mago still is Mago, brave and true, And precious to his country. Adh. True, indeed, Ten years' experience shows not even thou Canst thus alone perform the mighty work That's set before thee. Thou hast kept thy ground Gloriously, been a vengeance to thy foes, And shalt be, in the ages yet unborn; But neither Carthage nor yet Italy Have done their part by thee. We now can see The tide had reached its height when Capua joined thee; Then it stood still, and with her fall, alas! The ebb beganâit may flow back again, Canst thou but hold thy ground. Han. Hold it I will! I'll follow the old counsels of my namesake, And feed my soldiers on their enemies' flesh, Ere they shall starve me from the land I covet; I'll fight the Roman to the water's edge, Ere he shall drive me out of Italy. Yet by these ten years past I have taught Rome Some lessons she has wit to profit byâ And she, unlike to Carthage, has staunch friends, Confederate with her, whose hate to me Waxes, not wanes, with time, whilst on my side Too grievously the faithfullest have suffered, Oft as I've had no choice save to commit them To Roman mercy, or to root them up From house and lands, and bid them follow me. This cannot last for ever. Thus I stand Wholly alone this day. Sicily's lostâ Spain soon will beâand Carthage is exhausted. I must be now content by slow degrees To waste the heart of Rome; my armies now Must spread no longer o'er so wide a space: I must withdraw my garrisons, and take My stand in Bruttium; on that boundary I will maintain myself for years, if needful, Waiting for Carthage's revenge and mine. Mah. A goodly windfall of revenge for Rome When all Apulia lies beneath her feet! Ay, and for Metapontum such a rod As never yet hath scourged her in her dreams! Han. For those who choose it, I shall have in Bruttium A home of refuge still: her scorching rocks Within their rugged arms shall guard us well; The seas that wash her olive-mantled slopes Shall still be open to the ships of Carthage. So will we wait awhile, and laugh to scorn The State whose mightiest energies have failed From her fair gardens to dislodge her foe. Mah. So good-bye to Canusium! So we turn Our backs on CannÃ¦! Han. Even so. 'Tis time That all should brace their minds for the farewell To this familiar spot, dear to our hearts For past achievements. Now, my friends, I pray, Leave me alone. We'll meet again to supper. [Exeunt Maharbal and Adherbal. Mago is leftâand Mago is like him. Why cannot Mago fill his place for me? But I will cherish Mago with such love As I can spare unto the end of time, From him whose pale dishonoured head I kissedâ What time my very veterans wept aloudâ Kissed it, all shamed by the defiling dustâ With that great heartbreak that, through all my life, Shall need no second blow to break it more. Parted so longâO brother! brother! brother!â But I will never offer up again That costly funeral sacrifice of tears, Over whose agony the Roman gods Laughed in their skies!â O brother! oh, how often have my hopes Clasped thee with strenuous passion to a heart Married to thine by all the golden ties Of boyhood's love, and manhood's iron truthâ Married to thine by all the burning vows Of life-long constancy to one dear hateâ Hate deep as hell, unsatisfied as death! And there thou art!âWhy was this misery sent me? There is not in the compass of the world A fit revenge for it! Though I should ride Over the smoking ruins of their Capitol, Should sell their Senate for bondslaves in Carthage, What would it all do for me? Nothing! nothing!â Bound in the fetters of my childhood's vow, From Carthage I have lived a banished man, Nor ever have I murmured, though my days Have now shed off the green leaves of their spring. I have no wife nor child, but I had thee, Whose love to me was more than woman's love. Apart from thee I lived, but lived for thee! But now, divorced from that dear love of thine, Only for hate I live, only for Rome! To her my heart's stern marriage-vows be paid! Let her exult in my fidelity!â And there thou art, at last!âAnd there thou go'st, Down to the shades, to drench my father's soul In the immortal cup of thy despair! O Hasdrubal, for thee the maids of Carthage Shall drown the blossom of their youth in tears! O Hasdrubal, my fiery Hasdrubal! My other self, my hero Hasdrubal! My only love, my brother Hasdrubal!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âCarthage. A chamber in the house of Hasdrubal-Gisco, Sophonisba, and Ada. The sound of funeral music heard. Ada. Hark! hark! Those sounds! That mournful, mournful music! Ah, Sophonisba, 'tis the dirge for him! Soph. Indeed it is. Ada. 'Tis like the dirge of Carthage. [A long pause.] I wonder not Hasdrubal scorned to live; For me, I never could survive despair. I could not lift my hand against myself; But I would loathe my life until it left me. Soph. My Ada, hast thou thought, then, what death is? Ada. I know not what it is; but yet it seems So comforting to think the wretched die. Soph. But what, if in the grave there be no rest, No darknessânor in death the end of life, It's cure and consolation? What if, freed From this life's twilight, which we find so oft, Dull as it is, too bright for our tired eyes, The soul should burst at once into a light From whose strong blaze there is no hiding-place? Oppressed with such intensity of life, Our loves and hates, our griefs, our hopes and fears, Transplanted to eternity, and there Enlarged into eternal agoniesâ Our faculties and feelings framed anew Upon the vast scale of infinityâ May we not piningly look back to earth, As to the darkness of repose and bliss? As certainly as youth from childhood grows, For all our waiting death will come at last, And, like all other futures, will be found, I think, not that which we imagine it. Ada. Oh, surely, for the utterly unhappy, There must come some bright change! Soph. But not, I think, Unless we so subdue our natures here, So harmonize our passionate desires, That life may glide as nobly into death, As rivers, from their fountains widening on Steadily to the sea, there lose themselves With perfect and majestic resignation. Ada. You fear not death, then, Sophonisba? Soph. No. Ada. But still you think self-killing is a crime? Soph. I can imagine how it well might happen, Though life were wretched, 'twere a crime to die, And though 'twere sweet, it were a crime to live. Ada. I think, to hear of others' miseries Makes life most hard to bear! Soph. Dear child, may tears Bitterer than those fall never for your own! [Voices from without call âAda! Ada!â] Ada. Oh, they are calling me! I cannot goâ I cannot talk and laugh with them to-day. [Zeinab and Kora lift up the curtain from an archway, and show themselves.] Zein. Come, Ada! Come, we seek thee! Ada. Oh, not now! [Zeinab and Kora rush in and playfully draw her out.] Soph. Still, still, defeat, calamity, and shameâ And I find time to mourn my own heart's sorrow! How selfishly I called that life a ruin Which I can make a holocaust for Carthage! He could not be more lost to me than nowâ And yet I am sure he must have loved me once! He could not so deceive me, young and bright And ardent as he was, my playfellow, Companion, friend! He did, he did once love me, As surely as he loves me now no more. Oh, 'tis far best to leave this house for ever, And every spot where we have been togetherâ E'en this dear chamber sacred to those books In which we oft have studied from one page, Receiving into ours the soul of Greece, Plato and Aristotle our companions. Oh, never, never such a happy pair Will meet again there! Yet since he forgets, Casts that sweet past away as worthless trash, I must forget it, tooâI must forget To turn in thought to him, whene'er I hear Of noble actions, of heroic sorrows, The lofty works and thoughts of genius; never Must store fond fancies in my heart again, To tell him when he comes. Now must I learn To separate from his image all that seemed Immutably, essentially himself, And see in his true self but the same stranger His unloved rival is. Henceforth, I must, Where'er I live, live utterly alone. Enter Gisco. Gis. So, niece, alone as usual. Do you guess What news I bring? Soph. None that can give me joy. Gis. That is as may be. Syphax is in Carthageâ Ay, more than thatâis in this very house. Soph. I have expected it. Gis. And you must see him. 'Tis time now to give over pondering O'er Masanissa's coldness. He's a traitor, A mere Numidian traitor. For two years With Scipio he has tampered secretlyâ There's news for you! At Gades they two met, And, doubtless, there devised black treachery; The Roman with his false face, and smooth voice, And that majestic presence that we hear of, Bewitched him, as he has bewitched the Spaniards. They can't withstand the magic, curse upon it! Next, he departs for Africaâ Soph. Hold, uncle! How know you this? What proof have you of this? Gis. Read that, and that.âThere, are you satisfied? Well, then, of this be sureâhe'll not lose time In throwing off the mask, since this black news From Italy, since this huge overthrow Hannibal's puffed-up brother has brought on us. Now is the time to strike a blow against himâ A double blow whilst scarcely yet assured In the possession of his father's throne. Syphax must take both bride and kingdom from him. Soph. His kingdom? If he can. Gis. That is your business. Show a brave spirit, girl! Let him revenge you On your false lover! Not that he needs urging; Syphax hates Masanissa piously, As one true-born Numidian hates another. But we waste time. When will you see the king? Soph. Now. Gis. Then so be it. He's a noble chieftain, A true Numidian lion! Oh, to see him Spring on his desert charger, you would say, There is the men to rout the Roman horse! Your Masanissa's self excels him not, With all his boasted horsemanship. Soph. Enough! I have said that I will see him; bring him hither. Gis. You know your part! Engage him heart and soul To Carthage. Make your own conditions with him. [Exit. Soph. Oh, if it be my fate to give away My whole life for a price, at least the price Shall be no sordid one. Carthage shall thank me, And Syphax shall behold a hero's course Marked out before him by a bride who loved His rival once, as woman loves but once. Re-enter Gisco with Syphax. Welcome, King Syphax, to my father's house! Syph. Let me fall down and kiss thy garment's hem, For never did I see such beautyâno, Not in a dream. Soph. I pray thee rise, O king! Syph. O peerless lady! dost thou know mine errand? I come to seek thee for my wedded queen! From thine own lips they bid me take my answer, And therefore come I to thee. Wilt thou give it? Soph. I will. I here confirm my father's promise. Syph. Daughter of Carthage! thou hast made my heart Drunk with proud joy! How shall I pay thee back For such a sun-eclipsing gem as thou Hast lavished on me, giving me thyself? Wherewith shall I endow thee, O my queen? Thou shalt have all that beauty can desire To dazzle it with wonder at itself! Never did earth see such a sumptuous bride As daily in thy mirror thou shalt gaze on, In palace-chambers golden as the sun! Reigning from beauteous Cirtha rock-enthroned And river-girdled, o'er my fruitful land, Never was such a queen as thou shalt be, So crowned with worship, and with world-wide envy! Soph. I ask no gift but armies. Syph. Thou shalt have them! Soph. Syphax, in wedding me thou must become A Carthaginian. Never dream again Of peace with Rome till Carthage wars no more! I want no wedding-dances in thy Cirthaâ I only want to see thy tribe in arms. Syph. O Sophonisba! take the soul of Syphax. Do what thou wilt with all its loves and hates! Now will I spit upon the name of Rome, And hunt the soul of Scipio to the death! Take all the warrior horsemen of my land! If thousands fall, thousands shall fill their place, Born but for thee, for thee alone to die.â How dark the room grows! Oh, the sun has set Too soon, for thou art almost hidden from me. Do I mistake, or is thy face o'ercast? Dost thou regret my rival, Masanissa? Although like death I hate him, yet will I Bless him because he lost thee, Sophonisba! Tell me, dost thou regret him? Soph. Be content. I have renounced th'affianced of my youth As utterly as I would cast thee off, If e'er thy heart should turn again to Rome. Leave Masanissa! Wilt thou promise, then, To arm me thy Numidians whensoe'er My father needs themânot to spare thy men, Thy treasures, or thy realm itself to Carthage? Syph. I doâI do! And art thou really mine? Soph. Here is my hand, and here my sacred promise. Syph. O fair and gracious pledge! Gis. [approaching] Most noble king! This is the hour fixed for your conference With our two Suffetes. Shall I now attend you? Syph. I know not how to go! Beauty, adieu! Soph. Adieu, King Syphax. Gis. You will meet again. [Exeunt Gisco and Syphax. Scene II. âAnother apartment in the same house.âAda, Kora, and Zeinab, attended on by slaves, some dancing, some displaying caskets of jewels and other splendid ornaments. Kora. Is not this better, silly little Ada, Own it, than her wise talk? What, pouting still? Zein. Hast thou been sworn to talk and laugh no more? Ada. I cannot talk, I cannot laugh to-day. Zein. Oh, what's the matter now? Come, art thou jealous That Sophonisba weds this splendid king? Is it these costly gifts that make thee envious? Kora. I would I had a bridegroom that would send me An elephant so laden as the one That bore these southern brilliants to her door! The green flame of these emeralds stings mine eyes. Zein. These ivory chests, white as Astarte's brow, Are marvels in themselves! Kora. These fans I covetâ These ostrich-plumes, fit for Astarte's head! And this shawl-girdle, with its folding grace, Would turn the swarthiest Ethiop to a goddess. Ay, e'en black Zilla there, who laughs for wonder. Say, did thy Sophonisba spare a moment From Plato's pages, just to glance at these? Zein. What shall we do now? We have looked enough At bride gifts that, alas! are not our own! O Kora, would our bridegrooms, too, were kings! Now these dull dances tire meâbid them cease. Kora. I would we had th'Egyptian sorcerer here, To show us in his magic ink-drop all The faces of the great ones of the earth. I'd ask the portrait of Antiochus. Zein. And I, the King of Macedon. Kora. And youâ Whom would you ask for, Ada? Ada. Hannibal. Kora. Oh, what a child thou art! Why, we are all As weary of that name as any other Old story we have heard from infancy. Zein. This hero, this renowned conqueror, Whom we've all heard of, but have never seen, What has he done, worth doing, all this while? If I am well informed, the gates of Rome Are closed as fast as ever on his thousands. I've heard my father say a hundred times, The world's besotted to admire him so. Kora. Thanks to his negligence, one gallant army Has just been slaughtered, ay, and his own brother Amongst the number. No, you shall not, Ada, Be like the foolish mob that still calls out Upon Hamilcar's sons, as if they were The only names they knew. Ada. O Zeinab! Kora! For shame! Have you no heart, no soul, no spirit, To worship what is noble? Is it thus, As if you were of stone, you talk of him, Who, having given up allâchildhood, youth, manhoodâ For Carthage, ever toiling for our sakes, Now mourns o'er such a loss, with such a sorrow, That things like us, born and bred up secure In all the idle luxury of wealth, Can never dream the thousandth part of it? O Carthage, Carthage! to the end of time, Thus will all merit be rewarded by thee! Zein. Why, Ada! why this passionate burst? Indeed, We did not guess that you were so in earnest. Is not your father, too, his enemy? Kora. We never meant to grieve you. See, your cheek Is just the hue of these pomegranate blossoms! Zein. Come forth with us into the garden walks, Where, through the shadowy greenness of the dark, The night-air wanders drunk with fragrant silence. Come, come! This archway opes so temptingly On yonder marble steps; the flowering trees Whisper us forth. Ada. Go then, I'll follow you. [Kora and Zeinab run out into the garden.] They think me young and childish. Oh, this heart, Is it alone, then, in its passionate worship Of what's so good, and great, and beautiful? Would even Sophonisba smile to know? Must I have no companion save my dreams? O Hannibal! how is it I have felt, E'en from the first vague ardour of my childhood, Thy name was my possession, mine alone! I scorn them when they blame theeâwhen they praise, My swelling heart cannot endure to hear, But with a nameless fever of impatience, Rushes away into its own recesses. My life flows on, and, like a widening river, Still gathers in fresh streams new thoughts of thee! Thine image, growing as my spirit grows, Is every day more noble in mine eyes, And every day my soul, yet more astonished, Kneels to the awful beauty of thy life. Could I have been, if thou hadst never been? Could I have wedded this idolatrous dream To any other form of excellence? Invisible spirit, that hast made my life, I know not how, a secret consecrationâ To mine own self a mysteryâart thou not More than a spirit? Hannibal, Hannibal! And shall I never see thee, never know What my life's star is like? And thou, O Heaven! If thou couldst see me, should I seem to thee, As to the rest, only a thoughtless child, Born but to laugh, and sing, marry and die? Others speak of thee as a conqueror, A man of iron will, a man of camps And battles, and would smile if fancy threw A softer colour o'er thy stern career; But I can mourn for thee! I, a young girl, Can see more deeply into thy man's heart, Than men do, and I know that thou canst love! Yes, picturing thus thy grief for Hasdrubal, I feel as if I too had lost a brother.â Those merry voices! Can I really be So unlike them? Yet oh, I would not change! [She passes out into the garden.] Dirge for Hasdrubal. Youths and Maidens [Singing.] Soul of the slain! Rise from that battle-field of thy despair! Linger not there, Soul of the slain! On the dust of the bloody, trampled plain. From the dust where the heart of Carthage lies Bleeding beside thee, riseâoh, rise! Youths. Rise! But come not to the bitter cry Still round Bozra wailing for the dead! Come not here to see thy city lie, Garments rent, and ashes on her head, Prostrate at the shrines, where, mute as shameâ Veiling starry brows in clouds of woeâ Sit the gods that once, with eyes of flame, Watched thy thousands sweeping o'er the snow, Watched thee to the fatal river-shore, Watched till fell the night, and thou wert seen no more! Maidens. Again our morning-star is dimmed with rainâ Astarte weeps, Astarte weeps again, For a new Thammuz slain! Again, again, from all her locks unwound, Lotus and rose she flings upon the ground, And droops with head discrowned. In vain she turns for pity to the Sun, For on his blazing throne the mighty one, Great Baal, sits undone. Lord of the heavens, his golden glories pall, He wearies of the mad dance-festival, Nor answers us at all; Since he no longer, bending from his skies, To count the Roman host with awful eyes, Expects his sacrifice. Youths and Maidens. Soul of the slain! Rise from that battle-field of thy despair! Linger not there, Soul of the slain! On the dust of the bloody, trampled plain. From the dust where the heart of Carthage lies Bleeding beside thee, riseâoh, rise! Youths. Oh, still noble in thy great disgrace, Rise, but haste not, pale defeated ghost, Fiercely yearning for that lost embrace, To the tents of the ne'er-vanquished host! Haste not, haste not there, unseen, to seeâ Following closely, yet how far apart!â In its secret hours of agony Writhing, the great broken brother's heartâ Owning, what thou know'st too well, too well, That Carthage fell with him who on Metaurus fell! Maidens. Greatest of genii, that on eagle-wings Bear'st thy swift whispers to all living things, And tell'st strange truth to kings! Thou that to meet th'unbodied soul didst come, As back it bounded off the spears of Romeâ Death, bear him to his home! Oh, bear him o'er the waters of the West, To the long hours of sun-enchanted rest, With all th'heroic blest! Youths and Maidens. Mysterious mountain spires that, long ago, The fire-god throned below Bade with his voice of thunder to pierce through The wide Atlantic blueâ There, where your queen, Nivaria, towering high 'Twixt purple waves and sky, Casts from the snowy glitter of her crown Her miles of shadow downâ To whom gay genii came in sparkling throngs, Mingling their toil with songs, To robe you, like spoilt darlings of the seas, With gold-green glooms of trees; But left your bleak, stern heads, for ever bare, To brave the sun and air, And with strange blooms of new-invented flowers Perfumed your burning hours, And loosed with clapping hands a gilded crowd Of flutterers warbling loudâ O isles the genii bless'd ere home they flew From their sweet toils for you! Welcome this sad and glorious ghost, Whose life and hope at once were lost! Surround him, dreamy bliss of noon, Console him, soft sea-gilding moon! Stars, O ye flashing multitude, Receive him to your brotherhood! Soothe the soul-rending, fierce regret, That writhes and agonizes yet, To the grave, godlike melancholy Of hermit-kings who, gazing down From far, deluded mortals see War round their abdicated crown! Dear hero of our hearts' despair, Away to the sweet West, and rest for ever there! END OF PART I.</field>
