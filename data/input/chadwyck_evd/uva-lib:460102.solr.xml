      <field name="fulltext">THE EUNUCH; This seems to have been the most popular of all the Comedies of Terence. Suetonius and Donatus, both inform us that it was acted with the greatest applause, and that the Poet received a larger Price for it from the Ædiles, than had ever been paid for any before, viz. 8000 sesterces, which is about equal to 200 crowns, which in those times was a considerable sum.</field>

Attilius Prænestinus: The Musick, composed for Two Right-handed Flutes, by Flaccus, Freedman to Claudius: It is from the Greek of Menander. It was acted twice Acta II. Donatus informs us it was acted a third time. It is certain therefore that there is something wanting in this title, and that we should read acta II. DIE, acted twice IN ONE DAY, of which fact we are made acquainted by Suetonius. Dacier., M. Valerius, and C. Fannius, Consuls Baif, a Poet, who lived under Charles IX. made a translation of the Eunuch into French Verse, which, if I am not deceived, was never publickly represented, as there was not at that time a company of Comedians regularly established at Paris. I have not heard that before, or since his time, we have any other poetical translations of Terence; and my Andrian is, I believe, the first of his Comedies, that has appeared on our stage. Baron. Baron is partly mistaken. There is extant in the works of the celebrated Fontaine, a Comedy entitled L'Eunuque, being, like Baron's Andrian, founded on Terence, with such alterations, as the modern Poet thought adviseable in his age and country. Some of the principal variations will be observed in the course of these notes.. Year of Rome 591 Before Christ 159</field>

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. To please the candid, give offence to none, This, says the Poet, ever was his care: Meaning Lavinius, the Poet censured in the Prologue to the Andrian. Donatus.Yet if there's One, who thinks he's hardly censur'd, Let him remember He was the Aggressor: He, who translating many, but not well, On good Greek fables fram'd poor Latin plays; He, who but lately to the Publick gave The Phantom [?????] was the title of a Comedy of Menander; in which a young Man looking thro' a hole in the wall, which divides his father's house from a neighbour's, beholds a virgin of extraordinary beauty, and is affected with an aweful reverence, as at the sight of a Divinity; from which the Play is called the Phantom. The Mother, (who had this child by a secret amour before her marriage with the young Man's father, and educated her privately in the house of the next door neighbour) is represented to have made the hole in the wall, and to have decked the passage with garlands, and green branches, that it might look like a consecrated place; whither she daily went to her devotions, and used to call forth her daughter to converse with her there. The Youth, coming by degrees to the knowledge of her being but a mortal, his passion for her becomes so violent, as to admit of no cure but marriage; which at last is accomplished to the great satisfaction of the Mother and Daughter, the joy of the Lover, and the consent of his Father.—This argument of the Phasma Bentley gives us; but to whom we are obliged for it says he does not know, whether to Donatus or some older scholiast. Cooke.The Phantom of Menander; He, who made, In the Thesaurus, or Treasure, of Lavinius, a young fellow having squandered his estate, sends a servant ten years after his father's death, according to the will of the deceased, to carry provisions to his father's monument; but he had before sold the ground, in which the monument stood, to a covetous old man; to whom the servant applied to help him to open the monument; in which they discovered a hoard of gold and a letter. The old fellow seizes the Treasure, and keeps it, under pretence of having deposited it there, for safety, during times of war: the young fellow goes to law with him; and the old man is represented as opening the cause thus, “Athenians, why should I relate the war “with the Rhodians? &amp;c.” which Terence ridicules, because the young man who was the Plaintiff, should first shew his own title to it.— Thus far Bentley from the same scholiast. This note is a clear explanation of the passage to which it belongs. Hare concurs with Madam Dacier in her opinion, that this story of the Treasure was only an incident foisted by Lavinius into the Phantom of Menander, and not a distinct play: but was I not determined by the more learned Bentley, the Text itself would not permit me to concur in their opinion, as the words atque in Thesauro scripsit, seem plainly to be a transition to another play. Cooke. Menander, and his Cotemporary Philemon, each of them wrote a Comedy under this title. We have in the above note the story of Menander's; and we know that of Philemon's from the Trinummus of Plautus, which was a translation of it.In the Thesaurus, the Defendant plead And vouch the question'd treasure to be his, Before the Plaintiff his own title shews, Or whence it came into his father's tomb. Henceforward, let him not deceive himself, Or cry, “I'm safe, he can say nought of me.” I charge him that he err not, and forbear To urge me farther; for I've more, much more, Which now shall be o'erlook'd, but shall be known, If he persue his slanders, as before. Soon as this Play, the Eunuch of Menander, Which we are now preparing to perform, Was purchas'd by the Ædiles, he obtain'd Perfecit, sibi ut inspiciundi esset copia. The word inspiciundi certainly carries a stronger sense than merely to be present at the representation. The meaning of the whole passage I take to be this. That having obtained leave to peruse the M. S. he furnished himself with objections against the piece, which he threw out when it came to be represented before the Magistrates.Leave to examine it: and afterwards This is a remarkable passage, for it informs us that when the Magistrates had bought a piece, they had it represented at their own house, before it was played in publick. Dacier.When 'twas rehears'd before the Magistrates, “A Thief, he cried, no Poet gives this piece. “Yet has he not deceived us; for we know, “ Colax is a Greek word [?????] signifying a flatterer, which was the reason the Greeks gave that name to their Parasites. Dacier.The Colax is an antient Comedy “Of Nævius, and of Plautus; and from thence “The Parasite and Soldier both are stolen.” If that's the Poet's crime, it is a crime Of ignorance, and not a studied theft. Judge for yourselves! the fact is even thus. The Colax is a fable of Menander's; Wherein is drawn the character of Colax The Parasite, and the Vain-Glorious Soldier: Which characters, he scruples not to own, He to his Eunuch from the Greek transferr'd: If Plautus wrote a play under the title of Colax, I should think it very unlikely for Terence not to have seen it, considering how soon he flourished after Plautus, his being engaged in the same studies, and his having such access to the libraries of the Great. Among the fragments of Plautus is one verse said to be a line of the Colax: yet I am inclined to believe Plautus never translated Menander's Colax. The character of the Vain-Glorious Soldier here mentioned I am apt to think the same with that which is the Hero of Plautus's Comedy now extant, and called Miles Gloriosus; from which Terence could not take his Thraso. Pyrgopolinices and Thraso are both full of themselves, both boast of their valour, and their intimacy with princes, and both fancy themselves beloved by all the women, who see them; and they are both played off by their Parasites; but they differ in their manners and their speech. Plautus's Pyrgopolinices is always in the clouds, and talking big, and of blood and wounds, like our heroes commonly called Derby Captains. Terence's Thraso never says too little, nor too much, but is an easy ridiculous character, continually supplying the Audience with mirth, without the wild extravagant bluster of Pyrgopolinices. Plautus and Terence both took their Soldiers and Parasites from Menander, but gave them different dresses. Cooke. Though there is much good criticism in the above note, it is certain that Plautus did not take his Miles Gloriosus from the Colax of Menander, as he himself informs us it was translated from a Greek Play called ??????, the Boaster, and the Parasite is but a trifling character in that play, never appearing after the first scene.But that he knew, those pieces were before Made Latin, That he stedfastly denies. Yet if to other Poets 'tis not lawful To draw the characters, our fathers drew, How can it then be lawful to exhibit Slaves running to and fro; to represent Good matrons, wanton harlots; or to shew An eating parasite, vain-glorious soldier, Suppositious children, bubbled dotards, Or Love, or Hate, or Jealousy?—In short Nothing's said now, but has been said before. Weigh then these things with candour, and forgive The Moderns, if what Antients did, they do. Attend, and list in silence to our play, That ye may know what 'tis the Eunuch means.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter PHÆDRIA and PARMENO. Phæd. Phædria enters, as having deliberated a long time within himself and at last breaking out into these words. Donatus. Horace and Persius have both imitated this beautiful passage in their satires. And what then shall I do? not go? not now? When she herself invites me? or were't best Fashion my mind no longer to endure These harlots' impudence?—Shut out! recall'd! Shall I return? No, not if she implore me. Par. Oh brave! oh excellent! if you maintain it! But if you try, and can't go thro' with spirit, And finding you can't bear it, uninvited, Your peace unmade, all of your own accord, You come and swear you love, and can't endure it, Good night! all's over! ruin'd and undone! She'll jilt you, when she sees you in her pow'r. Phæd. You then, in time consider and advise! Par. Master! the thing which hath not in itself Or measure or advice, advice can't rule. In love are all these ills: suspicions, quarrels, Wrongs, reconcilements, war, and peace again: Things thus uncertain, if by reason's rules You'd certain make, it were as wise a talk To try with reason to run mad. And now What you in anger meditate—I her? An abrupt manner of speaking familiar to persons in anger, for the sentences are to be understood thus. I go to her?—that receiv'd him?—that excluded me?—that would not let me in: for indignation loves to deal in the Elleipsis and Aposiopesis. Donatus. As the Pronouns in our language admit a variation of Cafe, I saw no reason why I should not literally copy the beautiful egone illam? &amp;c. of Terence. That him?—that me? that would not—pardon me! I would die rather: No! she shall perceive How much I am a man.—Big words like these, She in good faith with one false tiny drop, Which, after grievous rubbing, from her eyes Can scarce perforce be squeez'd, shall overcome. Nay, she shall swear, 'twas you in fault, not she; You too shall own th'offence, and pray for pardon. Phæd. Oh monstrous! monstrous! now indeed I see How false she is, and what a wretch I am! Spite of myself I love; and knowing, feeling, With open eyes run on to my destruction; And what to do I know not. Par. What to do? What should you do, Sir, but redeem yourself As cheaply as you can?—at easy rates If possible—if not—at any rate— And never vex yourself. Phæd. Is that your counsel? Par. Ay, if you're wife; and do not add to love More troubles than it has, and those it has Bear bravely! But she comes, our ruin comes; There is an extreme elegance in this passage in the original. There is much the same sentiment in the Cymbeline of Shakespeare: and I believe, upon a fair comparison between them, the learned reader will agree with me, that the passage in the English poet is not only equal, but even superior in beauty to that in Terence. Sed ecca ipse egreditur, nostri fundi calamitas. Nam quod nos capere oportet, hæc intercipit. Ter. ? comes in my father; And, like the tyrannous breathing of the North, Shakes all our buds from blowing. Cymbeline, Act I. For she, like storms of hail on fields of corn, Beats down our hopes, and carries all before her. SCENE II. Enter THAIS. Thais. Ah me! I fear left Phædria take offence, And think I meant it other than I did, That he was not admitted yesterday. [to herself not seeing them. Phæd. I tremble, Parmeno, and freeze with horror. Par. Be of good cheer! approach yon fire—she'll warm you. Thais. Who's there? my Phædria? Why did you stand here? Why not directly enter? Par. Not one word Of having shut him out! Thais. Why don't you speak? Phæd. Because, forsooth, these doors will always fly Open to me, or that because I stand The first in your good graces. [ironically. Thais. Nay, no more! Phæd. No more?—O Thais, Thais, would to heaven Our loves were parallel, that things like these Might torture you, as this has tortur'd me; Or that your actions were indifferent to me! Thais. Grieve not, I beg, my love, my Phædria! Not that I lov'd another more, I did this. But I by circumstance was forc'd to do it. Par. So then, it seems, for very love, poor soul, You shut the door in's teeth. Thais. Ah, Parmeno! Is't thus you deal with me? Go to!—But hear Why I did call you hither? Phæd. Be it so. Thais. But tell me first, can yon slave hold his peace? Par. I? oh most faithfully: But hark ye, madam! On this condition do I bind my faith: The truths I hear, I will conceal; whate'er Is false, or vain, or feign'd, I'll publish it. I'm full of chinks, and run through here and there: So if you claim my secresy, speak truth. Thais. My mother was a Samian, liv'd at Rhodes. An indirect and tender manner of acknowledging her mother to be a courtezan, by saying she was a native of one place, and lived in another. For this reason courtezans were called strangers; and on this circumstance depends the archness and malice of Parmeno's answer. Donatus. Par. This sleeps in silence. [archly. Thais. There a certain merchant Made her a present of a little girl, Stol'n hence from Attica. Phæd. A citizen? Thais. I think so, but we cannot tell for certain: Her father's and her mother's name she told Herself; her country, and the other marks Of her original, she neither knew, Nor, from her age, was't possible she should. The merchant added further, that the pirates, Of whom he bought her, let him understand, She had been stol'n from Sunium. My mother Gave her an education, brought her up In all respects as she had been her own; And she in gen'ral was suppos'd my sister. I journied hither with the gentleman To whom alone I was connected then, The same who left me all I have. Par. Both these Are false, and shall go forth at large. Thais. Why so? Par. Because nor you with one could be content, Nor he alone enrich'd you; for my master Made good and large addition. Thais. I allow it. But let me hasten to the point I wish. Meantime the Captain, who was then but young In his attachment to me, went to Caria. I, in his absence, was addrest by you; Since when, full well you know, how very dear I've held you, and have trusted you with all My nearest counsels. Phæd. And yet Parmeno Will not be silent even here. Par. Oh, Sir, Is that a doubt? Thais. Nay, prithee now, attend! My mother's lately dead at Rhodes: her brother Too much intent on wealth, no sooner saw This virgin, handsome, well-accomplisht, skill'd In musick, than, spurr'd on by hopes of gain, In publick market he expos'd and sold her. It so fell out, my soldier-spark was there, And bought her, all unknowing these events, To give to me: but soon as he return'd, And found how much I was attach'd to you, He feign'd excuses to keep back the girl; Pretending, were he thoroughly convinc'd That I would still prefer him to yourself, Nor fear'd that when I had receiv'd the girl, I would abandon him, he'd give her to me; But that he doubted. For my part, I think He is grown fond of her himself. Phæd. Is there Aught more between them? Thais. No; for I've enquir'd. And now, my Phædria, there are sundry causes Wherefore I wish to win the virgin from him. First, for she's call'd my sister: and moreover, That I to her relations may restore her. I'm a lone woman, have nor friend, nor kin: Wherefore, my Phædria, I would raise up friends By some good turn:—And you, I prithee now, Help me to do it. Let him some few days Be my gallant in chief. What! no reply? Phæd. Abandon'd woman! can I aught reply To deeds like these? Par. Oh excellent! well said! He feels at length: Now, master, you're a man. Phæd. I saw your story's drift.—A little girl Stol'n hence—My mother brought her up—was call'd My sister—I would fain obtain her from him, That I to her relations might restore her— All this preamble comes at last to this. I am excluded, he's admitted. Why? But that you love him more than me, and fear Lest this young captive win your hero from you. Thais. Do I fear that? Phæd. Why, prithee now, what else? Does He bring gifts alone? did'st e'er perceive My bounty shut against you? Did I not Because you told me you'd be glad to have An Æthiopian servant-maid, all else Omitted, seek one out? You said besides, You wish'd to have an Eunuch, 'cause forsooth, They were for dames of quality. I found one. For both I yesterday paid twenty minæ. Equal to 64l. 11s. 8d. of our money. Cooke. Yet you contemn me—I forgot not these, And for these I'm despis'd. Thais. Why this, my Phædria? Tho' I would fain obtain the girl, and tho' I think by these means it might well be done; Yet, rather than make you my enemy, I'll do as you command. Phæd. Oh, had you said Those words sincerely. “Rather than make you “My enemy!”—Oh, could I think those words Came from your heart, what is't, I'd not endure! Par. Gone! conquer'd with one word! alas, how soon! Thais. Not speak sincerely? from my very soul? What did you ever ask, altho' in sport, But you obtain'd it of me? yet I can't Prevail on you to grant but two short days. Phæd. Well—for two days—so those two be not twenty. Thais. No in good faith but two, or— Phæd. Or? no more. Thais. It shall not be: but you will grant me those. Phæd. Your will must be a law. Thais. Thanks, my sweet Phædria! Phæd. I'll to the Country: there consume myself For these two days: it must be so: we must Give way to Thais.—See you, Parmeno, The slaves brought hither. Par. Sir, I will. Phæd. My Thais, For these two days, farewell! Thais. Farewell, my Phædria! Would you aught else with me? Phæd. Ought else, my Thais? Phædria's request to his mistress, upon leaving her for two days, is inimitably beautiful and natural. Addison's Spectator, No. 170. Imogen in the speech above cited from Shakespeare, expresses her intention to have said much the same kind of things on parting with Posthumus. As both the passages are extremely beautiful, it may not be disagreeable to the reader to compare them together. I did not take my leave of him, but had Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him, How I would think on him, at certain hours, Such thoughts, and such; or, I could make him swear, The shees of Italy should not betray Mine int'rest, and his honour; or have charg'd him At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight, To encounter me with orisons; for then I am in heaven with him, &amp;c.Be with yon soldier present, as if absent: All night and day love me: still long for me: Dream, ponder still of me; wish, hope for me; Delight in me; be all in all with me; Give your whole heart, for mine's all your's, to me. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Manet THAIS. The poet very judiciously reserves part of the argument to be told here, which Thais did not relate to Phædria, because Parmeno was present: whom the poet keeps in ignorance, that he may with probability dare to assist Chærea in his attempt on the virgin. Donatus. Ah me! I fear that he believes me not, And judges of my heart from those of others. Here Terence shews it to be his peculiar excellence to introduce common characters in a new manner, without departing from custom or nature: Since he draws a good courtezan, and yet engages and delights the spectator. Donatus. Under the name of Thais, Menander is supposed to have drawn the character of his own mistress, Glycere; and, it seems, he introduced a courtezan of the same name into several of his comedies. One comedy was entitled Thais, from which St. Paul took the sentence in his Epistle to the Corinthians. “Evil communications corrupt good manners.” Plutarch has also preserved four lines of the prologue to that comedy, in which the poet, in a kind of mock heroick manner invokes the muse, to teach him to draw the character of his heroine. ???? ??? ??? ????? ????????, ???, ????????, ?????? ?? ??? ??????? ???, ?????????, ????????????, ???????? ?????, ??????? ??????, ?????????????? ?? ???. Plut. de Audiend. Poet. Such therefore sing, O Goddess! Bold, but fair, And blest with all the arts of fond persuasion; Injurious, quarrellous, for ever craving, Caring for none, but feigning love to all. The word ???????????? alludes particularly to the shutting out her lovers, the very injury offered to Phædria in this play. Fontaine, probably for the same reasons that induced Baron to vary from his original, represents Thais as a young widow, instead of a courtezan. I in my conscience know, that nothing false I have deliver'd, nor to my true heart Is any dearer than this Phædria: And whatsoe'er in this affair I've done, For the girl's sake I've done: for I'm in hopes I know her brother, a right noble youth. To day I wait him, by his own appointment; Wherefore I'll in, and tarry for his coming.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. PHÆDRIA, PARMENO. Phædria. Carry the slaves according to my order This Scene contains a deal of lover's impertinence and idle talk, repeating what has been said before; and that too much over and over again, and in a tiresome manner. Donatus. If the Critic meant this note for a censure, it is in fact rather a commendation.. Par. I will. Phæd. But diligently. Par. Sir, I will. Phæd. But soon. Par. I will, Sir! Phæd. Say, is it sufficient? Par. Ah! what a question's that? as if it were So difficult! I wish, Sir Phædria, You could gain aught so easy, as lose these. Phæd. I lose, what's dearer yet, my comfort with them. Repine not at my gifts. Par. Not I: moreover I will convey them straight. But have you any Other commands? Phæd. Oh yes: Set off our presents With words as handsome as you can; and drive, As much as possible, that rival from her! Par. Ah, Sir! I should, of course, remember that. Phæd. I'll to the country, and stay there. Par. O, ay! [ironically. Phæd. But hark you! Par. Sir, your pleasure? Phæd. Do you think I can with constancy hold out, and not Return before my time? Par. Hold out? Not you. Either you'll straight return, or soon at night Your dreams will drive you out o'doors. Phæd. I'll toil; That, weary, I may sleep against my will. Par. Weary you may be; but you'll never sleep. Phæd. Ah, Parmeno, you wrong me. I'll cast out This treacherous softness from my soul, nor thus Indulge my passions. Yes, I could remain, If need, without her even three whole days. Par. Hui! UNIVORSUM triduum!—Crites. To read Macrobius, explaining the propriety and elegance of many words in Virgil, which I had before passed over without consideration, as common things, is enough to assure me that I ought to think the same of Terence; and that in the purity of his stile, (which Tully so much valued, that he ever carried his works about him) there is yet left in him great room for admiration, If I knew but where to place it. Eugenius. I should have been led to a consideration of the wit of the ancients, had not Crites given me sufficient warning not to be too bold in my judgment of it; because the languages being dead, and many of the customs, and little accidents, on which it depended, lost to us, we are not competent judges of it. But though I grant, that here and there we may miss the application of a proverb or a custom, yet a thing well said will be wit in all languages; and though it may lose something in the translation, yet to him who reads it in the original, it is still the same. He has an idea of its excellence, though it cannot pass from his mind into any other expression or words than those in which he finds it. When Phædria in the Eunuch had a command from his mistress to be absent two days, and encouraging himself to go through with it, said, Tandem egu, non illa caream, si opus sit, vel totum triduum? Parmeno, to mock the softness of his master, lifting up his hands and eyes, cries out, as it were in admiration, Hui! univorsum triduum! the elegancy of which univorsum, though it cannot be rendered in our language, yet leaves an impression on our souls. But this happens seldom in him, in Plautus oftener; who is infinitely too bold in his metaphors, and coining words; out of which many times his wit is nothing. Dryden's Essay of Dramatic Poesie.Hui! three whole livelong days! consider, Sir. Phæd. I am resolved. PARMENO alone. Part of Benedict's soliloquy in the second act of Much ado about Nothing is much in the same vein with this of Parmeno; only that it is heightened by the circumstance of its being immediately previous to his falling in love himself.Heav'ns, what a strange disease is this! that love Should so change men, that one can hardly swear They are the same!—No mortal liv'd Less weak, more grave, more temperate than he. —But who comes yonder?—Gnatho, as I live; The Captain's parasite! and brings along The Virgin for a present: oh rare wench! The poet makes Parmeno take notice of her extraordinary beauty, in order to make the violence of Chærea's passion for her the more probable. Donatus.How beautiful! I shall come off, I doubt, But scurvily with my decrepid Eunuch. This Girl surpasses ev'n Thais herself. SCENE II. These characters, the Parasite and the Soldier, as the Poet himself confesses, are not in the Eunuch of Menander, but taken from the Colax. Donatus. Two actions, equally laboured and driven on by the writer, would destroy the unity of the poem; it would be no longer one play, but two: Not but that there may be many actions in a play, as Ben Jonson has observed in his Discoveries, but they must be all subservient to the great one, which our language happily expresses in the name of under-plots: Such as in Terence's Eunuch is the difference and reconcilement of Thais and Phædria, which is not the chief business of the play, but promotes the marriage of Chærea and Chremes's sister, principally intended by the poet. There ought to be but one action, says Corneille, that is, one complete action, which leaves the mind of the audience in a full repose; but this cannot be brought to pass, but by many other imperfect actions which conduce to it, and hold the audience in a delightful suspence of what will be. Dryden's Essay of Dramatic Poesie. Instead of the quarrels of Thais and Phædria, which were most probably in the Eunuch of Menander, it would have been better to have instanced the characters taken from the Colax; which Terence has very artfully connected with the rest of the fable, by representing the Girl, loved by Chærea, as given to Thais by Thraso, which produces the absence of Phædria, leaves room for the comical imposture of Chærea, and, although adscititious, becomes the main spring of the whole action.Enter GNATHO; PARMENO behind. Gnat. This is the only scene in Terence, which I remember, that can be charged with being superfluous. Thraso has made a present to Thais of a young Girl. Gnatho is to carry her. Going along with her, he amuses himself with giving the Spectator a most agreeable eulogium on his profession. But was that the time for it? Let Gnatho pay due attention on the stage to the young woman whom he is charged with, and let him say what he will to himself, I consent to it. Diderot. Good heav'ns! how much one man excels another! What diff'rence 'twixt a wise man and a fool! What just now happen'd proves it: Coming hither I met with an old countryman, a man Of my own place and order, like myself, No scurvy fellow, who, like me had spent In mirth and jollity his whole estate. He was in a most wretched trim; his looks Lean, sick, and dirty; and his cloaths, all rags. How now! cry'd I, what means this figure, friend? Alas, says he, my patrimony's gone. —Ah, how am I reduc'd! my old acquaintance And friends all shun me.—Hearing this, how cheap I held him in comparison with me! Why, how now? wretch, said I, most idle wretch! Have you spent all, nor left ev'n hope behind? What! have you lost your sense with your estate? Me!—look on me—come from the same condition! How sleek! how neat! how clad! in what good case? I've ev'ry thing, though nothing; nought possess, Yet nought I ever want.—Ah, Sir, but I Have an unhappy temper, and can't bear To be the butt of others, or to take A beating now and then.—How then! d'ye think Those are the means of thriving? No, my friend! Such formerly indeed might drive a trade: Though the Vain Man and the Flatterer were characters in great measure dependant on each other, and therefore commonly shewn together, yet it is most probable, that in the Colax of Menander, from whence Gnatho and Thraso were taken by our author, the Parasite was the chief character, as in the ??????, or the Boaster, the Greek Comedy from which Plautus took his Miles Gloriosus, the Braggadochio Captain was most probably the principal. But this I think is not all: for in the present instance the Poet seems to have intended to introduce a new sort of Parasite, never seen upon the stage before; the master of a more delicate manner of adulation than ordinary flatterers, and supporting his consequence with his patron at the same time that he lives upon him, and laughs at him. Comedendo &amp; deridendo. Gnatho's acquaintance describes the old school of Parasites, which gives him occasion to shew in his turn, the superior excellence of the new sect, of which he is himself the founder. The first of these, as Madam Dacier observes justly, was the exact definition of a Parasite, who is described on almost every occasion by Plautus, as a fellow beaten, kicked, and cuffed at pleasure. Et hic quidem, hercle, nisi qui colophos perpeti Potis Parasitus, frangique aulas in caput, Vel ire extra portam trigeminam ad saccum licet. Capteivei, Act I. And here the Parasite, unless he can Bear blows, and have pots broken on his sconce, Without the city-gate may beg his bread. Gnatho, on the contrary, by his artful adulation, contrives to be caressed instead of ill-treated. Had the Colax of Plautus at least remained to us, we should perhaps have seen the specifick difference between Him and other Parasites more at large. In the Eunuch Gnatho is but episodical; but if this manner of considering his character be not too refined, it accounts for the long speech, so obnoxious to Diderot, with which he introduces himself to the audience; throws a new light on all he says and does; and is a strong proof of the excellence of Menander in drawing characters. However this may be, it is certain that Gnatho is one of the most agreeable Parasites in any play, antient or modern, except the incomparable Falstaff.But mine's a new profession; I the first That ever struck into this road. There are A kind of men, who wish to be the head Of ev'ry thing; but are not. These I follow; Not for their sport and laughter, but for gain To laugh with them, and wonder at their parts: Whate'er they say, I praise it; if again They contradict, I praise that too: Does any Deny? I too deny: Affirm? I too Affirm: and in a word I've brought myself To say, unsay, swear, and forswear, at pleasure: And that is now the best of all professions. Par. A special fellow this! who drives fools mad. Gnat. Deep in this conversation, we at length Come to the Market, where the sev'ral tradesmen, Butchers, cooks, grocers, poult'rers, fishmongers, (Who once did profit, and still profit by me) All run with joy to me, salute, invite, And bid me welcome. He, poor half-starv'd wretch, Soon as he saw me thus carest, and found I got my bread so easily, desired He might have leave to learn that art of me. I bad him follow me, if possible: And, as the Schools of the Philosophers Have ta'en from the Philosophers their names, So, in like manner, let all Parasites Be call'd from me Gnathonicks! Par. Mark, what ease, And being kept at other's cost produces! Gnat. But hold, I must convey this girl to Thais, And bid her forth to sup.—Ha, Parmeno! Our rival's slave, standing at Thais' door! —How melancholy he appears! All's safe: These poor rogues find but a cold welcome here. I'll play upon this Knave. [aside. Par. These fellows think This present will make Thais all their own. [aside. Gnat. To Parmeno, his lov'd and honour'd friend, Gnatho sends greeting. [ironically.]—What are you upon Quid agitur?—Statur. A mere play upon words, which is also in the Pseudolus of Plautus. There is much the same kind of conceit with the present in the Merry Wives of Windsor. Falstaff. My honest lads, I will tell you what I am About. Pistol. Two Yards and more. Par. My Legs. Gnat. I see it.—Is there nothing here Displeasing to you? Par. You. Gnat. I do believe it. But prithee, is there nothing else? Par. Wherefore? Gnat. Because you're melancholy. Par. Not at all. Gnat. Well, do not be so!—Pray, now, what d'ye think Of this young handmaid? Par. Troth, she's not amiss. Gnat. I plague the rascal. [half-aside. Par. How the knave's deceiv'd! [half-aside. Gnat. Will not this gift be very acceptable To Thais, think you? Par. You'd insinuate That we're shut out.—There is, alas, a change In all things. Gnat. For these six months, Parmeno, For six whole months at least, I'll make you easy; You shan't run up and down, and watch till day-light; Come, don't I make you happy? Par. Very happy. Gnat. 'Tis my way with my friends. Par. You're very good. Gnat. But I detain you: you, perhaps, was going Somewhere else. Par. No where. Gnat. May I beg you then To use your int'rest here, and introduce me To Thais? Par. Hence! away! these doors Fly open now, because you carry her. Gnat. Wou'd you have any one call'd forth? [Exit. Par. Well, well! Pass but two days; and you, so welcome now, That the doors open with your little finger, Shall kick against them then, I warrant you, Till your heels ache again. Re-enter GNATHO. Gnat. Ha! Parmeno! Are you here still? What! are you left a Spy, Lest any Go-between should run by stealth To Thais from the Captain? [Exit. Par. Very smart! No wonder such a wit delights the captain! But hold! I see my master's younger son Coming this way. I wonder much he should Desert Piræus, Piræus, as well as Sunium, was a maritime town of Attica, with a port, where the Athenian youth were placed on guard, to watch against the incursions of Pirates, or other enemies. Donatus. where he's now on guard. 'Tis not for nothing. All in haste he comes, And seems to look about. SCENE III. Enter CHÆREA. PARMENO behind. Chær. Undone! Undone! The Girl is lost; I know not where she is, Nor where I am: Ah, whither shall I trace? Where seek? of whom enquire? or which way turn? I'm all uncertain; but have one hope still: Where'er she is, she cannot long lie hid. O charming face! all others from my memory Hence I blot out. Tœdet quotidianarum harum formarum. It is impossible to translate this passage without losing much of its elegance, which consists in the three words ending in arum, which are admirably adapted to express disgust, and make us even feel that sensation. Dacier.Away with common beauties! Par. So, here's the other! and he mutters too I know not what of love. O what a poor Unfortunate old man their father is! As for this stripling, if he once begin, His brother's is but jest and children's play To his mad fury. Chær. Twice ten thousand curses Seize the old wretch, who kept me back to-day; And me for staying! with a fellow too I did not care a farthing for!—But see! Yonder stands Parmeno.—Good day! Par. How now? Wherefore so sad? and why this hurry, Chærea? Whence come you? Chær. I? I cannot tell, i'faith, Whence I am come, or whither I am going, I've so entirely lost myself. Par. And why? Chær. I am in Love. Par. Oh brave! Chær. Now, Parmeno, Now you may shew what kind of man you are. You know you've often told me; Chærea, Find something out to set your heart upon, And mark how I will serve you! yes, you know You've often said so, when I scrap'd together All the provisions for you at my father's. Par. Away, you trifler! Chær. Nay, in faith, it's true: Now make your promise good! and in a cause Worthy the utmost reachings of your soul: A girl! my Parmeno, not like our misses; Whose mothers try to keep their shoulders down, And bind their bosoms, that their shapes may seem Genteel and slim. Is a girl rather plump? Pugilem esse aiunt. Literally, they call her Boxer. The learned, I hope, will pardon, and the Ladies approve my softening this passage.They call her Nurse, and stint her in her food: Thus art, in spite of nature, makes them all Mere bulrushes: and therefore they're belov'd. Par. And what's this girl of your's? Chær. A miracle. Par. Oh, to be sure! Chær. True, natural red and white; Her body firm, and full of precious stuff! Par. Her age? Chær. About sixteen. Par. The very prime! Chær. This girl, by force, by stealth, or by intreaty, Procure me! how I care not, so I have her. Par. Well, whom does she belong to? Chær. I don't know. Par. Whence comes she? Chær. I can't tell. Par. Where does she live? Chær. I can't tell neither. Par. Where was it you saw her? Chær. Here in the street. Par. And how was it you lost her? Chær. Why, it was that, which I so fum'd about, As I came hither! nor was ever man So jilted by good fortune, as myself. Par. What mischief now? Chær. Confounded luck! Par. How so? Chær. How so! d'ye know one Archidemides, My father's kinsman, and about his age? Par. Full well. Chær. As I was in pursuit of her He met me. Par. Rather inconveniently. Chær. Oh most unhappily! for other ills May be told, Parmeno!—I could swear too, For six, nay seven months, I had not seen him, Till now, when least I wish'd and most would shun it. Is not this monstrous? Eh! Par. Oh! very monstrous. Chær. Soon as from far he saw me, instantly, Bent, trembling, drop-jaw'd, gasping, out of breath, He hobbled up to me.—Holo! ho! Chærea!— I stopt.—D'ye know what I want with you?—What? —I have a cause to-morrow.—Well! what then?— —Fail not to tell your father, he remember To go up with me, as an advocate The word, Advocate, Advocatus, did not bear the same sense then as it does with us at present. The Advocates, Advocati, were friends that accompanied those who had causes, either to do them honour, or to appear as witnesses, or to render them some other service. Dacier..— His prating took some time.—Ought else? said I. Nothing, said he:—Away flew I, and saw The girl that instant turn into this street. Par. Sure he must mean the virgin, just now brought To Thais for a present. Chær. Soon as I Came hither, she was out of sight. Par. Had she Any attendants? Chær. Yes; a parasite, With a maid-servant. Par. 'Tis the very same: Away! have done! all's over Jam conclamatum est. A metaphor taken from the Funeral Ceremonies of the Ancients.. Chær. What d'ye mean? Par. The Girl I mean. Chær. D'ye know then who she is? Tell me!—or have you seen her? Par. Yes, I've seen her; I know her; and can tell you where she is. Chær. How! my dear Parmeno, d'ye know her? Par. Yes. Chær. And where she is, d'ye know? Par. Yes,—there she is; [pointing. Carried to Madam Thais for a present. Chær. What monarch could bestow a gift so precious? Par. The mighty Captain Thraso, Phædria's rival. Chær. Alas, poor brother! Par. Ay, and if you knew The gift he sends to be compar'd with this, You'd cry Alas, indeed! Chær. What is his gift? Observe with what address Terence proceeds to the main part of his argument: the Eunuch being casually mentioned suggests, as it were of course, the stratagem of imposing Chærea upon the family of Thais for him. Donatus. Par. An Eunuch. Chær. What! that old and ugly slave, That he bought yesterday? Par. The very same. Chær. Why, surely, he'll be trundled out o'doors He and his gift together—I ne'er knew Till now that Thais was our neighbour. Par. She Has not been long so. Chær. Ev'ry way unlucky! Ne'er to have seen her neither!—Prithee, tell me Is she so handsome, as she's said to be? Another instance of the art of Terence, in preserving the probability of Chærea's being received for the Eunuch. He was such a stranger to the family, that he himself did not even know the person of Thais. It is added further, that she has not lived long in the neighbourhood, and the young fellow has been chiefly at Piræus. Donatus. Par. Yes faith! Chær. But nothing to compare to mine. Par. Oh, quite another thing. Chær. But Parmeno! Contrive that I may have her. Par. Well, I will. Depend on my assistance:—have you any Further commands? [as if going. Chær. Where are you going? Par. Home; To bring, according to your brother's order, The slaves to Thais. Chær. Oh, that happy Eunuch! To be convey'd into that house! Par. Why so? Chær. Why so? why, he shall have that charming Girl His fellow-servant, see her, speak with her, Be with her in the same house all day long, And sometimes eat, and sometimes sleep by her. Par. And what if You should be so happy? Chær. How? Tell me, dear Parmeno! Par. Assume his dress. Chær. His dress! what then? Par. I'll carry you for him. Chær. I hear you. Par. I will say that you are he. Chær. I understand you. Par. So shall you enjoy Those blessings, which but now you envied him: Eat with her, be with her, touch, toy with her, And sleep by her: since none of Thais' maids Know you, or dream of what you are. Besides Your figure, and your age are such, that you May well pass for an Eunuch. Chær. Oh, well said! I ne'er heard better counsel. Come, let's in! Dress me, and carry me! Away, make haste! Par. What are you at? I did but jest. Chær. You trifle. Par. I'm ruin'd: Fool, what have I done?—Nay whither D'ye push me thus? you'll throw me down. Nay, stay! Chær. Away. Par. Nay prithee! Chær. I'm resolv'd. Par. Consider; You carry this too far. Chær. No, not at all. Give way! Par. And Parmeno must pay for all. Istæc in me cudetur faba. Literally, the Bean will be threshed on me. A Proverb taken from the countrymen's threshing Beans; or from the cooks dressing them, who when they had not moistened them enough, but left them hard and tough, were sure to have them thrown at their heads. Donatus. The commentators give us several other interpretations of this proverb. Ah, we do wrong! Chær. Is it then wrong, for me Here Terence obliquely defends the subject of the piece. Donatus. To be convey'd into a house of harlots, And turn those very arts on them, with which They hamper us, and turn our youth to scorn? Can it be wrong for me too, in my turn, To deceive them, by whom we're all deceiv'd? No, rather let it be! 'tis just to play This trick upon them: which, if greybeards know, They'll blame indeed, but all will think well done. Par. Well, if you must, you must; but do not then, After all's over, throw the blame on me. Chær. No, no! Par. But do you order me? Chær. I do: Order, command, force. Par. Oh, I'll not dispute Your pow'r. So, follow me. Chær. Heav'n speed the plough!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter THRASO, and GNATHO. Thraso. And Thais then returns me many thanks? Gnat. Ten thousand. Thra. Say, is she delighted with it? Gnat. Not so much with the gift itself, as that By you 'twas given: But therein she triumphs. Enter PARMENO behind. Par. I'm come to look about me, and observe A proper opportunity to bring My presents. But behold the Captain! Thra. 'Tis Something, I know not how, peculiar to me, That all I do's agreeable. Gnat. In truth I have observ'd it. Thra. E'en the King always Held himself much obliged, whate'er I did: Not so to others. Gnat. Men of wit, like you, The glory, got by others' care and toil, Often transfer unto themselves. Thra. You've hit it. Gnat. The king then held you— Thra. Certainly. Gnat. Most dear. Thra. Most near. He trusted his whole army to me, His counsels.— Gnat. Wonderful! Thra. And then, whene'er Satiety of company, or hate Of business seiz'd him—when he would repose— As if—you understand me. Gnat. Perfectly. When he wou'd—in a manner—clear his stomach Of all uneasiness. Thra. The very thing. On such occasions he chose none but me. Gnat. Hui! there's a king indeed! a king of taste! Thra. One of a thousand. Gnat. Of a million sure! —If he could live with you. [aside. Thra. The courtiers all Began to envy me, and rail'd in secret: I car'd not; whence their spleen increas'd the more. One in particular, who had the charge Of th'Indian elephants; who grew at last So very troublesome, “I prithee, Strato, “Are you so savage, and so fierce, (says I) “Because you're governor of the wild beasts?” Gnat. Oh, finely said! and shrewdly! Excellent! Too hard upon him!—what said He to't? Thra. Nothing. Gnat. And how the devil should he? Par. Gracious heav'n! The stupid coxcomb!—and that rascal too! [aside. Thra. Ay! but the story of the Rhodian, Gnatho! How smart I was upon him at a feast— Did I ne'er tell you? Gnat. Never: but pray do! —I've heard it o'er and o'er a thousand times. [aside. Thra. We were by chance together at a feast— This Rhodian, that I told you of, and I.— I, as it happen'd, had a wench: The spark Began to toy with her, and laugh at me. “Why how now, Impudence! (said I) are You “A hare yourself, and yet would hunt for game?” Gnat. Ha! ha! ha! Thra. What's the matter? Gnat. Ha! ha! ha! Witty! smart! excellent! incomparable! Is it your own? I swear I thought 'twas old. Thra. Why did you ever hear it? Gnat. Very often; And reckon'd admirable. Thra. 'Tis my own. Gnat. And yet 'twas pity to be so severe On a young fellow, and a gentleman. Par. Ah! devil take you! [aside. Gnat. What became of him? Thra. It did for him. The company were all. Ready to die with laughing:—in a word They dreaded me. Gnat. No wonder. Thra. Harkye, Gnatho! Thais, you know, suspects I love this Girl. Shall I acquit myself? Gnat. On no account. Rather increase her jealousy. Thra. And why? Gnat. Why?—do you ask?—as if you didn't know!— Whene'er she mentions Phædria, or whene'er She praises him, to vex you— Thra. I perceive. Gnat. To hinder that, you've only this resource. When she names Phædria, name you Pamphila. If she should say, come! let's have Phædria To dinner with us!—ay, and Pamphila To sing to us!—if she praise Phædria's person, Praise you the Girl's! so give her tit for tat, And gall Her in her turn. Thra. Suppose she lov'd me, This might avail me, Gnatho! Gnat. While she loves The presents which you give, expecting more, So long she loves you; and so long you may Have pow'r to vex her. She will always fear To make you angry, lest some other reap The harvest, which she now enjoys alone. Thra. You're right: and yet I never thought of it. Gnat. Ridiculous! because you did not turn Your thoughts that way; or with how much more ease Wou'd you have hit on this device yourself! Several persons of the play are concerned in this scene, and yet, by the art and excellence of the Poet, there arises no confusion of dialogue; each speech being admirably adapted to the character to which it is appropriated. Donatus.SCENE II. Enter THAIS, and PYTHIAS. Thais. I thought I heard the Captain's voice: and see! Good-day, my Thraso! Thra. Oh my Thais, welcome! How does my sweeting?—are you fond of me For sending you that musick-girl? Par. Oh brave! He sets out nobly! Thais. For your worth I love you. Gnat. Come, let's to supper! why do you delay? Par. Mark t'other! he's a chip of the old block. Ex homine hunc natum dicas. There has been much dispute about the meaning of these words. The old familiar expression, which I have made use of, is, I think, agreeable to the obvious and natural meaning of them. That Dryden understood them in this sense is evident from the following passage. “In the New Comedy of the Græcians, the Poets sought indeed to express the ?????, as in their Tragedies the ????? of mankind. But this contained only the general characters of men and manners; that is, one old man or father, one lover, one courtezan, so like another as if the first of them had begot the rest of every sort. Ex homine hunc natum dicas. Essay of Dramatick Poesie. Thais. I'm ready when you please. Par. I'll up to her, And seem as if but now come forth.—Ha! Thais, Where are you gadding? Thais. Well met, Parmeno! I was just going— Par. Whither? Thais. Don't you see The Captain? Par. Yes, I see him—to my sorrow. The presents from my master wait your pleasure. Thra. Why do we stop thus? wherefore go not hence? [angrily. Par. Beseech you, Captain, let us, with your leave, Convenire &amp; colloqui. Military terms; used by Parmeno to sneer at Thraso. Donatus.Produce our presents, treat, and parley with her! Thra. Fine gifts, I warrant you, compar'd with mine! Par. They'll answer for themselves.—Holo, there! order The slaves, I told you, to come forth.—Here, this way! Enter a Black Girl. Do You stand forward!—This girl, ma'am, comes quite From Æthiopia. Thra. Worth about three Minæ. A Mina was equal to 3l. 4s. 7d. Cooke. Gnat. Scarce. Par. Ho! where are you, Dorus?—oh, come hither! Enter Chærea in the Eunuch's habit. An Eunuch, Madam!—of a lib'ral air, And in his prime! Thais. Now as I live, he's handsome! Par. What say You, Gnatho? Is he despicable? Or, Captain, what say You?—Dumb?—Praise sufficient! Try him in letters, exercises, musick: In all the arts, a gentleman should know, I'll warrant him accomplish'd. From the following passage in Twelfth Night, concerning the disguise of Viola, one might be almost tempted to imagine that Shakespeare had the Eunuch of Terence in his eye. Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent. I'll serve this Duke; Thou shalt present me as an Eunuch to him: It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing, And speak to him in many sorts of musick, That will allow me very worth his service. Thra. Troth, that Eunuch Is well enough. Par. And he, who sends these presents, Requires you not to live for him alone, And for his sake to shut out all mankind: Nor does he tell his battles, shew his wounds, Or shackle your free will, as some folks do. [looking at Thraso. But when 'twill not be troublesome, or when You've leisure, in due season, he's content If then he is admitted. Thra. This poor fellow Seems to belong to a poor wretched master. Gnat. Beyond all doubt; for who that could obtain Another, would endure a slave like this? Par. Peace, wretch, that art below the meanest slave! You, that could bring your mind so very low, As to cry Ay and No at yon fool's bidding, I'm sure, might get your bread out o' the fire. E flamina petere cibum. A proverb to express the lowest degree of meanness and infamy: taken from a custom among the Antients of throwing victuals into the fire, at the time of burning their dead; to eat which was looked on as an act of the greatest indignity. Cooke. Thra. Why don't we go? [impatiently. Thais. Let me but carry in These first, and give some orders in the house, And I'll attend you. [Exit with Chærea, and the Æthiopian. Thra. I'll depart from hence. Gnatho, wait you for her! Par. It ill beseems The dignity of a renown'd commander, T'escort his mistress in the street. Thra. Away, Slave! you're beneath my notice—like your master. [Exit Par. Gnat. Ha! ha! ha! ha! Thra. What moves your laughter? Gnat. That You said just now: and then the Rhodian came Across my mind.—But Thais comes. Thra. Go, run, And see that ev'ry thing's prepar'd at home! Gnat. It shall be done. [Exit. Thais. [entering with Pythias] Take care now, Pythias, An artful preparation for the ensuing difference between her and Thraso. Donatus. Great care, if Chremes come, to press him stay; Or, if that's inconvenient, to return: If that's impossible, then bring him to me! Pyth. I'll do so. Thais. Hold! what else had I to say? Take care, be sure, of yonder virgin! see, You keep at home! Thra. Let's go! Thais. Girls, follow me! [Exit, attended by Servants and Thraso. SCENE III. CHREMES alone. In truth, the more and more I think, the more I am convinc'd that Thais means me ill: So plain I see her arts to draw me in. Ev'n when she first invited me, (and when Had any ask'd, What business have you there? The question would have stagger'd me) she fram'd Sev'ral excuses to detain me there. The Antients used to offer a sacrifice, before they entered on any affair of importance. Cooke.Said she had made a sacrifice, and had Affairs of consequence to settle with me. —Oho! thought I immediately, I smell A trick upon me!—down she fat, behav'd Familiarly, and tried to beat about For conversation. Being at a loss, She ask'd, how long my parents had been dead? —I told her, long time since:—on which she ask'd, Whether I had a country-house at Sunium? —And how far from the sea?—I half believe She likes my villa, and would wheedle me To give it her.—Her final questions were, If I ne'er lost a little sister thence? —Who was miss'd with her?—what she had, when lost? If any one could know her?—why should Thais Demand all this, unless,—a saucy baggage!— She means to play the counterfeit, and feign Herself that sister?—but if She's alive, She is about sixteen, not more: and Thais Is elder than myself.—She sent beside To beg I'd come again.—Or, let her say What she would have; or, not be troublesome! I'll not return a third time.—Ho! who's there? Here am I! Chremes! SCENE IV. Enter PYTHIAS. Pyth. Oh, sweet, charming, Sir! Chre. A coaxing hussy! Pyth. Thais begs and prays You'd come again to-morrow. Chre. I am going Into the country. Pyth. Nay, now, prithee come! Chre. I can't, I tell you. Pyth. Walk in then, and stay Till she returns herself. Chre. Not I. Pyth. And why, Dear Chremes? Chre. Go, and hang yourself! Pyth. Well, Sir, Since you're so positive, shall I intreat you To go to her? Chre. I will. Pyth. Here, Dorias! [a maid-servant enters. Conduct this gentleman to Captain Thraso's. [Pythias re-enters.—Chremes goes out another way with Dorias. SCENE V. ANTIPHO alone. But yesterday a knot of us young fellows Assembled at Piræus, and agreed To club together for a feast to-day. Chærea had charge of all; the rings were given. It was usual to deposit their rings, as pledges of observing their appointment. And time, and place appointed.—The time's past; No entertainment's at the place; and Chærea Is no where to be found.—I can't tell what To think on't.—Yet the rest of my companions Have all commission'd me to seek him out. I'll see if he's at home;—but who comes here From Thais?—Is it He, or no?—'Tis He.— —What manner of man's here?—what habit's that? —What mischief has the rogue been at? I'm all Astonishment, and cannot guess.—But I'll. Withdraw awhile, and try to find it out. [retires. SCENE VI. Enter CHÆREA, in the Eunuch's habit. Chær. [looking about] Is any body here?—No, nobody. Does any follow me?—No, nobody. May I then let my extacy break forth? Proh Jupiter! Nunc est prosecto, cum interfici perpeti me possum, Ne hoc gaudium contaminet vita agritudine aliquâ. The passage from Othello, cited in a note on the last act of the Andrian, contains exactly the same sentiment, and almost in the same words with this of Terence.O Jupiter! 'tis now the very time, When I could suffer to be put to death, Lest not another transport like to this, Remain in life to come.—But is there not Some curious impertinent to come Across me now, and murder me with questions? —To ask, why I'm so flutter'd? why so joyful? Whither I'm going? whence I came? and where I got this habit? what I'm looking after? Whether I'm in my senses? or stark mad? Anti. I'll go myself, and do that kindness to him. Chærea, [advancing.] what's all this flutter? what's this dress? What is't transports you? what d'ye want? art mad? Why do you stare at me? and why not speak? Chær. O happy, happy day!—Save you, dear friend! There's not a man on earth I'd rather see This moment than yourself. Anti. Come, tell me all! Chær. Tell you! I will beseech you give me hearing. D'ye know my brother's mistress here? Anti. Yes: Thais, Or I'm deceiv'd. Chær. The same. Anti. I do remember. Chær. To-day a girl was sent a present to her. Why need I speak or praise her beauty now To you, that know me, and my taste so well? She set me all on fire. Anti. Is she so handsome? Chær. Most exquisite: Oh, had you but once seen her, You would pronounce her, I am confident, The first of woman-kind.—But to be brief, I fell in love with her.—By great good luck There was at home an Eunuch, which my brother Had bought for Thais, but not yet sent thither. —I had a gentle hint from Parmeno, Which I seiz'd greedily. Anti. And what was that? Chær. Peace, and I'll tell you.—To change dresses with him, And order Parmeno to carry me Instead of him. Anti. How? for an Eunuch, You? Chær. E'en so. Anti. What good could you derive from that? Chær. What good!—why, see, and hear, and be with her I languish'd for, my Antipho!—was that An idle reason, or a trivial good? —To Thais I'm deliver'd; she receives me, And carries me with joy into her house; Commits the charming girl— Anti. To whom?—to You? Chær. To Me. Anti. In special hands, I must confess. Chær. —Injoins me, to permit no man come near her; Nor to depart, myself, one instant from her; In Greece the women always occupied the interior apartments, where nobody was permitted to come to them, but relations, and the slaves that waited upon them. Dacier.But in an inner chamber to remain Alone with her alone. I nod, and look Bashfully on the ground. Anti. Poor simple soul! Chær. I am bid forth, says she; and carries off All her maid-servants with her, save some few Raw novices, who strait prepar'd the bath. I bad them haste; and while it was preparing, In a retiring-room the Virgin sat; A very proper piece of furniture for the house of a courtezan, giving an example of loose and mercenary love; calculated to excite wanton thoughts, and at the same time hinting to the young lover that he must make his way to the bosom of his mistress, like Jupiter to Danae, in a shower of gold. Oh the avarice of harlots! Donatus.Viewing a picture, where the tale was drawn Of Jove's descending in a golden show'r To Danae's bosom.—I beheld it too, And because He of old the like game play'd, I felt my mind exult the more within me, That Jove should change himself into a man, And steal in secret thro' a stranger-roof, With a mere woman to intrigue.—Great Jove, Who shakes the highest heav'ns with his thunder! Qui templa cœli summa of sonitu concutit. A parody on a passage in Ennius. Donatus. And I, poor mortal man, not do the same!— I did it, and with all my heart I did it. —While thoughts, like these, possest my soul, they call'd The girl to bathe. She goes, bathes, then returns: Which done, the servants put her into bed. I stand to wait their orders. Up comes one, Here, harkye, Dorus! take this fan, and mark You cool her gently thus, while we go bathe. When we have bath'd, You, if you please, bathe too. I, with a sober air, receive the fan. Anti. Then would I fain have seen your simple face! I should have been delighted to behold How like an ass you look'd, and held the fan. Chær. Scarce had she spoke, when all rush'd out o'doors; Away they go to bathe; grow full of noise, As servants use, when masters are abroad. Meanwhile sleep seiz'd the virgin: I, by stealth, Peep'd thro' the fansticks thus; then looking round, And seeing all was safe, made fast the door. Anti. What then? Chær. What then, fool! Anti. I confess. Chær. D'ye think, Blest with an opportunity like this, Short indeed, considering the number of incidents, which, according to Chærea's relation, are crowded into it. All the time, allowed for this adventure, is the short space between the departure of Thais with Thraso and the entrance of Chærea; so that all this variety of business of sleeping, bathing, ravishing, &amp;c. is dispatched during the two soliloquies of Antipho and Chremes, and the short scene between Chremes and Pythias. The truth is, that a very strict and religious adherence to the Unities often drives the Poet into as great absurdities as the profest violation of them.So short, so wish'd for, yet so unexpected, I'd let it slip? No. Then I'd been, indeed, The thing I counterfeited. Anti. Very true. But what's become of our club-supper? Chær. Ready. Anti. An honest fellow! where? at your own house? Chær. At Freeman Discus's. Anti. A great way off. Chær. Then we must make more haste. Anti. But change your dress. Chær. Where can I change it? I'm distrest. From home I must play truant, lest I meet my brother. My father too, perhaps, is come to town. Preparation for the arrival of the father. Donatus. Anti. Come then to my house! that's the nearest place Where you may shift. Chær. With all my heart: let's go! And at the same time, I'll consult with you How to enjoy this dear girl. Anti. Be it so. Instead of this scene, Fontaine in his Eunuch, has substituted one between Chærea and Pamphila, whom he brings on the stage, as Baron does Glycerium in the Andrian. Chærea professes honourable love, leaves her in the house of Thais, and applies to his father, by whose consent he at last obtains her in marriage. Fontaine was most probably right in his conjecture, that the Plot of the Eunuch, exactly as it lies in Terence, was not conformable to the severity of the French, or, perhaps the English stage. It would certainly therefore have been advisable, in order to adapt it for representation before a modern audience, to change some circumstances, and the introduction of Pamphila might perhaps have been hazarded not without success: But by departing so essentially, as Fontaine has done from Menander and Terence, the very foundations of the fable are undermined, and it loses most part of that vivacity and interest so remarkable in the Play before us.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter DORIAS, with a Casket. 'Tis true, the Antients have kept the continuity of scenes somewhat better than the Moderns. Two do not perpetually come in together, talk, and go out together; and other two succeed them, and do the same throughout the act, which the English call by the name of single scenes; but the reason is, because they have seldom above two or three scenes, properly so called, in every act; for it is to be accounted a new scene, not only every time the stage is empty, but every person who enters, though to others, makes it so; because he introduces a new business. Now the plots of their plays being narrow, and the persons few, one of their acts was written in a less compass than one of our well-wrought scenes; and yet they are often deficient even in this. To go no farther than Terence, you find, in the Eunuch, Anpho entering single in the midst of the third Act, after Chremes and Pythias were gone off: In the same play you have likewise Dorias beginning the fourth act alone; and after she has made a relation of what was done at the Soldier's entertainment, (which by the way was very inartificial, because she was presumed to speak directly to the audience; and to acquaint them with what was necessary to be known, but yet should have been so contrived by the Poet, as to have been told by persons of the Drama to one another, and so by them to have come to the knowledge of the people she quits the stage, and Phædria enters next, alone likewise: He also gives you an account of himself, and of his returning from the country in monologue, to which unnatural way narration Terence is subject in all his plays. In his Adelphi, or Brothers, Syrus and Demea enter, after the scene is broken by the departure of Sostrata, Geta, and Canthara; and indeed you can scarce look into any of his comedies, where you will not presently discover the same interruption. Dryden's Essay of Dramatick Poesie. DORIAS. Now, as I hope for mercy, I'm afraid, From what I've seen, lest yonder swaggerer Make some disturbance, or do violence To Thais. For, as soon as Chremes came, (The youth that's brother to the virgin) she Beseech'd of Thraso, he might be admitted. This piqu'd him; yet he durst not well refuse. She, fearing Chremes should not be detain'd, Till she had time and opportunity To tell him all she wish'd about his sister, Urg'd Thraso more and more to ask him in. The Captain coldly asks him; down he sat; And Thais enter'd into chat with him. The Captain, fancying a rival brought Before his face, resolv'd to vex Her too: Here, boy, said he, let Pamphila be call'd To entertain us!—Pamphila! cries Thais; She at a banquet!—No, it must not be.— Thraso insisting on't, a broil ensued: On which my Mistress slyly slipping off Her jewels, Because courtezans were not allowed to wear gold or jewels in the street. Dacier. gave them me to bear away; Which is, I know, a certain sign, she will, As soon as possible, sneak off herself. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter PHÆDRIA. Here the Poet artfully finds a reason to bring Phædria back again; as he at first with equal art sent him out of the way, to give probability to those incidents, necessary to happen in his absence. Donatus. Phæd. Going into the country, I began (As happens when the mind is ill at ease) To ponder with myself upon the road, Tossing from thought to thought, and viewing all In the worst light. While thus I ruminate, I pass'd unconsciously my country-house, And had got far beyond, e'er I perceiv'd it. I turn'd about, but with a heavy heart; And soon as to the very spot I came Where the roads part, I stopt. Then paus'd awhile: Alas! thought I, and must I here remain Two days? alone? without her?—Well! what then? That's nothing.—What, is't nothing?—If I've not The privilege to touch her, shall I not Behold her neither?—If one may not be, At least the other shall.—And certainly Extremâ lineâ amare, haud nihil est. Supposed to be a metaphor taken from the lines drawn in the chariot-races.Love, in its last degree, is something still. —Then I, on purpose, past the house.—But see! Pythias breaks forth affrighted.—What means this? SCENE III. Enter PYTHIAS and DORIAS; PHÆDRIA at a distance. Pyth. Where shall I find, unhappy that I am, Where seek this rascal-slave?—this slave, that durst To do a deed like this?—Undone! undone! Phæd. What this may be, I dread. Pyth. And then the villain, After he had abused the virgin, tore The poor girl's cloaths, and dragg'd her by the hair. Phæd. How's this? Pyth. Who, were he now within my reach, How could I fly upon the vagabond, And tear the villain's eyes out with my nails! Phæd. What tumult's this, arisen in my absence? I'll go and ask her.—[going up.]—What's the matter, Pythias. Why thus disturb'd? and whom is it you seek? Pyth. Whom do I seek? Away, Sir Phædria! You and your gifts together! Phæd. What's the matter? Pyth. The matter, Sir! The Eunuch, that you sent us, Has made fine work here! the young Virgin, whom The Captain gave my mistress, he has ravish'd. Phæd. Ravish'd? How say you? Pyth. Ruin'd, and undone! Phæd. You're drunk. Pyth. Would those, who wish me ill, were so! Dori. Ah, Pythias! what strange prodigy is this? Phæd. You're mad: how could an Eunuch— Pyth. I don't know Or who, or what he was.—What he has done, The thing itself declares.—The Virgin weeps, Nor, when you ask what ails her, dare she tell. But he, good man, is no where to be found: And I fear too, that when he stole away, He carried something off. Phæd. I can't conceive Whither the rascal can have flown, unless He to our house, perhaps, slunk back again. Pyth. See now, I pray you, if he has. Phæd. I will. [Exit. Dori. Good lack! so strange a thing I never heard. Pyth. I've heard, that they lov'd women mightily, But could do nothing; yet I never thought on't: For if I had, I'd have confin'd him close In some bye place, nor trusted the girl to him. SCENE IV. Re-enter PHÆDRIA, with DORUS the Eunuch, in Chærea's cloaths. Phæd. Out, rascal, out!—What are you resty, sirrah? Out, thou vile bargain! Dor. Dear sir! [crying. Phæd. See the wretch! What a wry mouth he makes!—Come, what's the meaning Of your returning? and your change of dress? What answer, sirrah?—If I had delay'd A minute longer, Pythias, I had miss'd him, He was equipp'd so bravely for his flight. Pyth. What, have you got the rogue? Phæd. I warrant you. Pyth. Well done! well done! Dori. Ay, marry, very well. Pyth. Where is he? Phæd. Don't you see him? Pyth. See him? whom? Phæd. This fellow, to be sure. Pyth. This man! who is he? Phæd. He that was carried to your house to-day. Pyth. None of our people ever laid their eyes Upon this fellow, Phædria! Phæd. Never saw him? Pyth. Why, did you think this fellow had been brought To us? Phæd. Yes, surely; for I had no other. Pyth. Oh dear! this fellow's not to be compar'd To t'other.—He was elegant, and handsome. Phæd. Ay, so he might appear awhile ago, Because he had gay cloaths on: now he seems Ugly, because he's stript. Pyth. Nay, prithee, peace! As if the diff'rence was so very small!— The youth conducted to our house to-day, 'Twould do you good to cast your eyes on, Phædria: This is a drousy, wither'd, weazel-fac'd, Menander's words, as preserved by Donatus, are these, ????? ???? ???????? ?????, which he charges Terence with having misunderstood. ????, he says is a Weazle, and ???????? a Lizard. But Terence is very likely to have made Pythias express her dislike of the Eunuch, by comparing him to a Weazle, whose skin has much of the tawny in it. As to the passage from Menander, there is nothing of the colour of the animal expressed in it. A Lizard being a thin animal, Menander probably intended a similitude in the Jankness. ???????? ????? may therefore be construed a thin, half-starv'd fellow. Cooke. Old fellow. Phæd. How?—you drive me to that pass, That I scarce know what I have done myself. —Did not I buy you, rascal? [to Dorus. Dor. Yes, sir. Pyth. Order him, To answer me. Phæd. Well, question him. Pyth. to Dorus.] Was You Brought here to-day? [shakes his head.] See there! Not He. It was Another, a young lad, about sixteen, Whom Parmeno brought with him. Phæd. to Dorus.] Speak to Me! First tell me, whence had you that coat? What, dumb? I'll make you speak, you villain! [beating him. Dor. Chærea came— [crying. Phæd. My brother? Dor. Yes, sir! Phæd. When? Dor. To-day. Phæd. How long since? Dor. Just now. Phæd. With whom? Dor. With Parmeno. Phæd. Did you, Know him before? Dor. No, Sir; nor e'er heard of him. Phæd. How did you know then that he was my brother? Dor. Parmeno told me so; and Chærea Gave me these cloaths— Phæd. Confusion! [aside. Dor. Put on mine; And then they both went out o'doors together. Pyth. Now, sir, do you believe that I am sober? Now do you think, I've told no lie? And now Are you convinc'd the Girl has been abus'd! Phæd. Away, fool! d'ye believe what this wretch says? Pyth. What signifies belief?—It speaks itself. Phæd. apart to Dorus.] Come this way—hark ye!—further still.—Enough. Tell me once more.—Did Chærea strip you? Dor. Yes. Phæd. And put your cloaths on? Dor. Yes, sir! Phæd. And was brought In your stead hither? Dor. Yes. Phæd. Great Jupiter! [pretending to be in a passion with him. What a most wicked scoundrel's this? Pyth. Alas! Don't you believe, then, we've been vilely us'd? Phæd. No wonder if you credit what he says? I don't know what to do. [aside.]—Here, harkye, sirrah! Deny it all again. [apart to Dorus.]—What! can't I beat The truth out of you, rascal?—have you seen My brother Chærea? [aloud and beating him. Dor. No, sir! [crying. Phæd. So! I see He won't confess without a beating.—This way! [apart.] Now He owns it; now denies it.—Ask my pardon! [apart. Dor. Beseech you, sir, forgive me! Phæd. Get you gone, [kicking him. Dor. Oh me! oh dear! [Exit bowling. Phæd. aside. I had no other way To come off handsomely.—We're all undone. —D'ye think to play your tricks on me, you rascal? [Aloud, and Exit after Dorus. SCENE V. Manent PYTHIAS and DORIAS. Pyth. As sure as I'm alive, this is a trick Of Parmeno's. Dori. No doubt on't. Pyth. The revenge of Pythias on Parmeno is very artfully made productive of the catastrophe. Donatus.I'll devise Some means to-day to fit him for't.—But now, What would you have me do? Dori. About the Girl? Pyth. Ay; shall I tell? or keep the matter secret? Dori. Troth, if you're wise, you know not what you know, Nor of the Eunuch, nor the ravishment: So shall you clear yourself of all this trouble, And do a kindness to our mistress too. Say nothing, but that Dorus is gone off. Pyth. I'll do so. Dori. Prithee is not Chremes yonder? Thais will soon be here. Pyth. How so? Dori. Because When I came thence, a quarrel was abroach Amongst them. Pyth. Carry in the jewels, Dorias! Meanwhile I'll learn of Chremes what has happen'd. [Exit Dori. SCENE VI. Enter CHREMES tipsey. Chrem. So! so!—I'm in for't—and the wine I've drank Has made me reel again.—Yet while I sat, How sober I suppos'd myself!—But I No sooner rose, than neither foot, nor head, Knew their own business! Pyth. Chremes! Chrem. Who's that?—Ha! Pythias!—How much more handsome you seem now, Than you appear'd a little while ago! Pyth. I'm sure you seem a good deal merrier. Chrem. I'faith it's an old saying, and a true one, Sine Cerere &amp; Libero friget Venus. A proverb, signifying that love is cold without good eating and drinking.“Ceres and Bacchus are warm friends of Venus.” —But, pray, has Thais been here long before me? Pyth. Has she yet left the Captain's? Chrem. Long time since: An age ago. They've had a bloody quarrel. Pyth. Did not she bid you follow her? Chrem. Not she: Only she made a sign to me at parting. Pyth. Well, wasn't that enough? Chrem. No, faith! I did not At all conceive her meaning, till the Captain Gave me the hint, and kick'd me out o' doors. —But here she is! I wonder how it was, I overtook her! SCENE VII. Enter THAIS. Thais. I am apt to think, The Captain will soon follow me, to take The Virgin from me: Well then, let him come! But if he does but lay a finger on her, We'll tear his eyes out.—His impertinence, And big words, while mere words, I can endure; But if he comes to action, woe be to him! Chrem. Thais, I have been here some time. Thais. My Chremes! The very man I wanted!—Do you know That you have been th'occasion of this quarrel? And that this whole affair relates to you? Chrem. To me! how so? Thais. Because, while I endeavour, And study to restore your sister to you, This and much more I've suffer'd. Chrem. Where's my Sister? Thais. Within, at my house. Chrem. Ha! [with concern. Thais. Be not alarm'd: She has been well brought up, and in a manner Worthy herself and you. Chrem. Indeed? Thais. 'Tis true: And now most freely I restore her to you, Demanding nothing of you in return. Chrem. I feel your goodness, Thais, and shall ever Remain much bounden to you. Thais. Ay, but now Take heed, my Chremes, lest e'er you receive The maid from me, you lose her! for 'tis She, Whom now the Captain comes to take by storm. —Pythias, go, fetch the casket with the proofs! Chrem. D'ye see him, Thais? [looking out. Pyth. Where's the casket plac'd? Thais. Plac'd in the cabinet.—D'ye loiter, hussy? [Ex. Pyth. Chrem. What force the Captain brings with him against you! Good heav'n! Thais. Are you afraid, young gentleman? Chrem. Away!—who? I? afraid?—There is no man Alive less so. Thais. You'd need be stout at present. Chrem. What kind of man d'ye take me for? Thais. Consider, He, whom you've now to cope with, is a stranger, Less powerful than you, less known, and less Befriended here than you! Chrem. I know all that: But why, like fools, admit, what we may shun? Better prevent a wrong, than afterwards Revenge it, when receiv'd.—Do you step in, And bolt the door, while I run to the Forum, And call some officers to our assistance. [going. Thais. Stay! [holding him. Chrem. 'Twill be better. Thais. Hold! Chrem. Nay, let me go! I'll soon be back. Thais. We do not want them, Chremes. Say, only, that this Maiden is your sister, And that you lost her when a child, and now Know her again for your's. Enter PYTHIAS. Thais to Pyth.] Produce the proofs! Pyth. Here they are. Thais. Take them, Chremes!—If the Captain Attempts to do you any violence, Lead him before a magistrate. D'ye mark me? Chrem. I do. Thais. Be sure now speak with a good courage! Chrem. I will. Thais. Come, gather up your cloak.—Undone! I've got a champion, who wants help himself. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. Enter THRASO, GNATHO, SANGA, &amp;c. Thraso. Shall I put up with an affront so gross, So monstrous, Gnatho?—No, I'd rather die. Simalio, Donax, Syrus, follow me! First, I will storm their castle. Gnat. Excellent! Thra. Next carry off the Virgin. Gnat. Admirable! Thra. Then punish Thais herself. Gnat. Incomparable! Thra. Here, in the center, Donax, with your club! Do you, Simalio, charge on the left wing! You, Syrus, on the right!—Bring up the rest! Where's the Centurion Sanga, and his band Of rascal runaways? San. Here, sir! Thra. How now? Think'st thou to combat with a dishclout, slave! That thus thou bring'st it here? San. Ah, sir! I knew The valour of the gen'ral, and his troops; And seeing this affair must end in blood, I brought a clout, to wipe the wounds withall. Thra. Where are the rest? San. Rest! Plague, whom d'ye mean? There's nobody, but Sannio, left at home. Thra. Lead you the van; [to Gnatho.] And I'll bring up the rear: Thence give the word to all. Gnat. What wisdom is! Now he has drawn up these in rank and file, His post behind secures him a retreat. Thra. Just so his line of battle Pyrrhus form'd. Chremes and Thais appear above at a window. Chrem. D'ye see, my Thais, what he is about? To bar and bolt the doors was good advice. Thais. Tut, man! yon fool, that seems so mighty brave, Is a mere coward. Do not be afraid! Thra. What were best? [to Gnatho. Gna. Troth, I wish you had a sling: That you from far in ambush might attack them! They'd soon fly then, I warrant you. Thra. But see! Thais appears. Gnat. Let's charge them then! Come on! Thra. Halt!—'Tis the part of a wise general To try all methods, e'er he come to arms. How do you know, but Thais may obey My orders without force? Gnat. Oh, gracious heavens! Of what advantage is it to be wise! I ne'er approach but I go wiser from you. Thra. Thais, first answer this! Did you, or no, When I presented you the Virgin, promise, To give yourself some days to me alone? Thais. What then? Thra. Is that a question, when you durst To bring a rival to my face?— Thais. And what Business have you with him? Thra. —And then stole off In company with him? Thais. It was my pleasure. Thra. Therefore, restore me Pamphila; unless You chuse to see her carried off by force. Chrem. She restore Pamphila to you? Or You Attempt to touch her, rascal? Gnat. Ah, beware! Peace, peace, young gentleman! Thra. to Chrem.] What is't you mean? Shall I not touch my own? Chrem. Your own, you scoundrel? Gnat. Take heed! you know not whom you rail at thus. Chrem. Won't you be gone?—here, hark ye, sir!—d'ye know How matters stand with you?—if you attempt To raise a riot in this place to-day, I'll answer for it, that you shall remember This place, to-day, and me, your whole life long. Gnat. I pity you: to make so great a man Your enemy! Chrem. Hence! or I'll break your head. Gnat. How's that, you hang-dog? Are you for that sport? Thra. Who are You, fellow?—what d'ye mean?—and what Have you to do with Pamphila? Chrem. I'll tell you. First, I declare, that she's a free-born woman! Thra. How? Chrem. And a citizen of Athens. Thra. Hui! Chrem. My sister. Thra. Impudence! Chrem. So, Captain, now I give you warning, offer her no force! —Thais, I'll now to Sophrona, the Nurse, And bring her here with me to see the proofs. Thra. And you prohibit me to touch my own? Chrem. Yes, I prohibit you. Gnat. D'ye hear? he owns The robbery himself. Isn't that sufficient? Thra. And, Thais, you maintain the same? Thais. Ask those, Who care to answer. [Shuts down the window. Manent THRASO, and GNATHO, &amp;c. Thra. What shall we do now? Gnat. Why—e'en go back again!—This harlot here Will soon be with you to request forgiveness. Thra. D'ye think so? Gnat. Ay, most certainly. I know The ways of women.—When you will, they won't. And when you won't, they're dying for you. Thra. True. Gnat. Shall I disband the army? Thra. When you will. Gnat. Beaumont and Fletcher seem to have had their thoughts on this scene in their draught of the Mob-Regiment in Philaster. The old Captain disembodies his Militia much in the same manner with Gnatho.—“Fall off again my sweet Youths; come, and every man trace to his house again, and hang his pewter up.”Sanga, as well becomes a brave militia, Take to your houses and fire-sides again. San. My mind was like a sop i'th'pan, long since. Gnat. Good fellow! Sang. To the right about there! march! [Exit with Gnatho and Thraso at the head of the troops.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. THAIS and PYTHIAS. THAIS. Still, still, you baggage, will you shuffle with me? —“I know—I don't know—he's gone off—I've heard— “I was not present.”—Be it what it may, Can't you inform me openly?—The Virgin, Her cloaths all torn, in sullen silence weeps. The Eunuch's fled.—What means all this? and what Has happen'd?—Won't you answer me? Pyth. Alas! What can I answer you?—He was, they say, No Eunuch. Thais. What then? Pyth. Chærea. Thais. Chærea! What Chærea? Pyth. Phædria's younger brother. Thais. How! What's that, hag? Pyth. I've discover'd it: I'm sure on't. Thais. Why, what had he to do with us? or why Was he brought hither? Pyth. That I cannot tell; Unless, as I suppose, for love of Pamphila. Thais. Alas! I am undone; undone, indeed, If that, which you have told me now, be true. Is't that the Girl bemoans thus? Pyth. I believe so. Thais. How, careless wretch! was that the charge I gave you At my departure? Pyth. What could I do? She Was trusted, as you bad, to him alone. Thais. Oh, jade, you set the wolf to keep the sheep. —I'm quite asham'd to 've been so poorly bubbled. Pyth. Who comes here?—Hist! peace, madam, I beseech you! We're safe: we have the very man. [Seeing Chærea at a distance. Thais. Where is he? Pyth. Here, on the left; d'ye see him, ma'am? Thais. I see him. Pyth. Let him be seiz'd immediately! Thais. And what Can we do to him, fool? Pyth. Do to him, say you? —See, what a saucy face the rogue has got! Ha'nt he?—and then how settled an assurance! SCENE II. Enter CHÆREA. Chær. Chærea assigns very natural reasons for not having changed his dress: and here it is worth while to observe the art of Terence, since the sequel of the fable made it absolutely necessary that Chærea should appear again before Thais in the habit which he wore while in the house. Dacier.At Antipho's, as if for spite, there were His father and his mother both at home, So that I could by no means enter, but They must have seen me. Meanwhile, as I stood Before the door, came by an old acquaintance, At sight of whom, I flew, with all my speed, Into a narrow unfrequented alley; And thence into another, and another, Frighten'd and flurried as I scampered on, Lest any one should know me.—But is that Thais? 'Tis she herself. I'm all aground. What shall I do?—Pshaw! what have I to care? What can she do to me? Thais. Let's up to him. Oh, Dorus! Good sir, welcome!—And so, sirrah, You ran away. Chær. Yes, madam! Thais. And you think It was a clever trick? Chær. No, madam! Thais. Can you Believe, that you shall go unpunish'd for it? Chær. Forgive me this one fault! If I commit Another, kill me! Thais. Do you dread my cruelty? Chær. No, ma'am! Thais. What then? Chær. I was afraid, lest She Accuse me to you. [pointing to Pythias. Thais. Upon what account? Chær. A little matter. Pyth. Rogue! a little matter? Is it so little, think you, to abuse A virgin, and a citizen? Chær. I thought She was my fellow-servant. Pyth. Fellow-servant! I can scarce hold, from flying at his hair. Monstrous! he's come to make his sport of us. Thais. Away! you rave. Pyth. Why so? if I had don't, I should have still been in the monster's debt; Particularly, as he owns himself Your servant. Thais. Well—no more of this.—Oh, Chærea, You've done a deed unworthy of yourself: For granting, I perhaps, might well deserve This injury, it was not honourable In you to do it.—As I live, I know not What counsel to persue about this girl; You've so destroy'd my measures, that I can't Restore her, without blushing, to her friends, Nor so deliver her, as I propos'd, To make them thank me for my kindness, Chærea. Chær. Henceforth, I hope, eternal peace shall be Betwixt us, Thais! Oft from things like these, And bad beginnings, warmest friendships rise. What if some God hath order'd this? Thais. Indeed, I'll so interpret it, and wish it so. Chær. I prithee do!—and be assured of this, That nought I did in scorn, but all in love. Thais. I do believe it; and, on that account, More readily forgive you: for oh, Chærea, I am not form'd of an ungentle nature, Nor am I now to learn the pow'r of love. Chær. Now, Thais, by my life, I love Thee too. Pyth. Then, by my troth, you must take care of him. Chær. I durst not— Pyth. I don't mind a word you say. Thais. Have done! Chær. But now, in this one circumstance, Let me beseech you to assist me! I Commit myself intirely to your care: Invoke you, as my patroness; implore you. Perdition seize me, but I'll marry her! Thais. But if your father— Chær. What of Him? I know He'll soon consent, provided it appears That she's a citizen. Thais. If you will wait A little while, her brother will be here: He's gone to fetch the nurse, that brought her up; And You shall witness the discovery. Chær. I will remain then. Thais. But, in the mean time, Had you not rather wait within, than here Before the door? Chær. Much rather. Pyth. What the plague Are you about? Thais. What now? Pyth. What now, indeed? Will you let Him within your doors again? Thais. Why not? Pyth. Remember that I prophecy, He'll make some fresh disturbance. Thais. Prithee, peace! Pyth. It seems, you have not had sufficient proof Of his assurance. Chær. I'll do no harm, Pythias! Pyth. I'll not believe it, Chærea, till I see it. Chær. But you shall keep me, Pythias! Pyth. No, not I. For, by my troth, I would trust nothing with you, Neither to keep, nor be kept by you.—Hence! Away! Thais. Oh brave! the brother's here. [looking out. Chær. Confusion! Let's in, dear Thais! I'd not have him see me Here in this dress. Thais. Why so? Are you asham'd? Chær. I am indeed. Pyth. Indeed! asham'd! oh dear! Think of the girl! Thais. Go in! I'll follow you. Pythias, do you stay here to bring in Chremes. [Exeunt Thais and Chærea. SCENE III. PYTHIAS, CHREMES, SOPHRONA. Pyth. What can I think of? what can I devise? Some trick now to be even with that rogue Who palm'd this young spark on us. Chrem. leading the nurse.] Nay but stir Your stumps a little faster, nurse! Soph. I come. Chrem. Ay, marry; but you don't come on a jot. Pyth. Well! have you shewn the tokens to the nurse? Chrem. I have. Pyth. And pray what says she? Did she know them? Chrem. At first sight. Pyth. Oh brave news! I'm glad to hear it; For I've a kindness for the Girl. Go in; My mistress is impatient for your coming. [Exeunt Chrem. and Soph. See, yonder's my good master Parmeno, Marching this way: How unconcern'd, forsooth, He stalks along!—But I've devis'd, I hope, The means to vex him sorely.—First I'll in, To know the truth of this discovery, And then return to terrify this rascal. [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter PARMENO. Par. I'm come to see what Chærea has been doing: Who, if he has but manag'd matters well, Good heav'ns, how much, and what sincere applause Shall Parmeno acquire!—For not to mention, In an intrigue so difficult as this, Of so much probable expence at least Since with a griping harlot he'd have bargain'd, That I've procur'd for him the girl he lov'd, Without cost, charge, or trouble; t'other point, That, that I hold my master-piece, there think I've gain'd the prize, in shewing a young spark The dispositions and the ways of harlots; Which having early learnt, he'll ever shun. [Enter Pythias behind. When they're abroad, forsooth, there's none so clean, Nothing so trim, so elegant, as they; Nor, when they sup with a gallant, so nice! To see these very creatures' gluttony, Filth, poverty, and meanness, when at home; So eager after food, that they devour From yesterday's stale broth the coarse black bread:— All this to know is safety to young men. SCENE V. PYTHIAS, PARMENO. Pyth. behind.] 'Faith, sirrah, I'll be handsomely revenged For all you've done and said. You shall not boast Your tricks on us without due punishment. [aloud, coming forward. Oh heav'ns! oh dreadful deed! oh hapless youth! Oh wicked Parmeno, that brought him here! Par. What now? Pyth. It mov'd me so, I could not bear To see it: therefore I flew out o' doors. What an example will they make of him! Par. Oh Jupiter! what tumult can this be? Am I undone, or no?—I'll e'en enquire. Pythias, [going up] What now? what is't you rave about? Who's to be made this terrible example? Pyth. Who? most audacious monster! while you meant To play your tricks on us, you have destroy'd The youth, whom you brought hither for the Eunuch. Par. How so? and what has happen'd? Prithee tell me! Pyth. Tell you? D'ye know the virgin, that was sent To-day to Thais, is a citizen? Her brother too a man of the first rank? Par. I did not know it? Pyth. Ay, but so it seems. The poor young spark abus'd the girl; a thing No sooner known, than he, the furious brother— Par. Did what? Pyth. First bound him hand and foot— Par. How! bound him! Pyth. And now, though Thais begg'd him not to do it— Par. How! what! Pyth. Moreover threatens, he will serve him After the manner of adulterers; A thing I ne'er saw done, and ne'er desire. Par. How durst he offer at an act so monstrous? Pyth. And why so monstrous? Par. Is it not most monstrous? Who ever saw a young man seiz'd and bound For rapes and lewdness in a house of harlots? Pyth. I don't know. Par. Aye; but you must all know this. I tell you, and foretell you, that young spark Is my old master's son. Pyth. Indeed! is he? Par. And let not Thais suffer any one To do him violence!—But why don't I Rush in myself? Pyth. Ah! take care, Parmeno, What you're about; lest you do him no good, And hurt yourself: for they imagine you, Whatever has been done, the cause of all. Par. What shall I do then, Wretch? what undertake? —Oh! yonder's my old master, just return'd To town. Shall I tell Him, or no?—I'faith I'll tell him, tho' I am well convinc'd, it will Bring me into a scrape; a heavy one: And yet It must be done to help poor Chærea. Pyth. Right. I'll in again; and you, in the mean while, Tell the old gentleman the whole affair. [Exit. SCENE VI. Here the Poet introduces Laches, as he did Parmeno just before, in a state of perfect tranquility; that the sudden turn of their state of mind might be more entertaining to the spectators. Donatus.Enter LACHES. Laches. I've this convenience from my neighb'ring villa; I'm never tir'd of country, or of town. For as disgust comes on, I change my place. —But is not that our Parmeno? 'Tis he For certain.—Whom d'ye wait for, Parmeno, Before that door? Par. Who's that? oh, sir! you're welcome: I'm glad to see you safe return'd to town. Laches. Whom do you wait for? Par. I'm undone: my tongue Cleaves to my mouth thro' fear. Laches. Ha! what's the matter? Why do you tremble so? Is all right? Speak! Par. First, sir, I'd have you think, for so it is, Whatever has befall'n, has not befall'n Through any fault of mine. Laches. What is't? Par. That's true. Your pardon, sir, I should have told that first. —Phædria, sir, bought a certain Eunuch, as A present to send her. Laches. Her!—Her! whom? Par. Thais. Laches. Bought? I'm undone! at what price? Par. Twenty Minæ. Laches. I'm ruin'd. Par. And then Chærea's fall'n in love With a young musick-girl. Laches. How! what! in love! Knows He, already, what a harlot is? Has He stol'n into town? More plagues on plagues. Par. Nay, sir! don't look on me! it was not done By my advice. Laches. Leave prating of yourself. As for you, rascal, if I live—But first Whatever has befallen, tell me, quick! Par. Chærea was carried thither for the Eunuch: Laches. He for the Eunuch? Par. Yes: since when, within They've seiz'd and bound him for a ravisher. Laches. Confusion! Par. See the impudence of harlots! Laches. Is there ought else of evil or misfortune, You have not told me yet? Par. You know the whole. Laches. Then why do I delay to rush in on them? [Exit. Par. There is no doubt but I shall smart for this. But since I was oblig'd to't, I rejoice That I shall make these strumpets suffer too: For our old gentleman has long desir'd Some cause to punish them; and now he has it. SCENE VII. Enter PYTHIAS, PARMENO at a distance. Pyth. Well! I was ne'er more pleas'd in all my life, Than when I saw th'old man come blund'ring in. I had the jest alone; for I alone Knew what he was afraid of. Par. Hey! what now? Pyth. I'm now come forth t'encounter Parmeno. Where is he? Par. She seeks me. Pyth. Oh, there he is. I'll go up to him. Par. Well, fool, what's the matter? [Pythias laughs. What wou'd you? what d'ye laugh at? Hey! what still? Pyth. Oh, I shall die: I'm horribly fatigu'd With laughing at you. [laughing heartily. Par. Why so? pray! Pyth. Why so? [laughing. I ne'er saw, ne'er shall see, a greater fool. Oh, it's impossible to tell, what sport There is a great error, in regard to the Unity of Time, in Terence's Eunuch, when Laches, the old Man, enters by mistake into the house of Thais, where betwixt his Exit and the Entrance of Pythias, who comes to give ample relation of the disorders he has raised within, Parmeno, who was left upon the stage, has not above five lines to speak. C'est bien employer un temps si court. Dryden's Essay of Dramatick Poesie. Besides the absurdity here taken notice of by Dryden, in regard to Time, there is also another inconvenience, in the present instance, arising from too strict an adherence to the Unity of Place. What a figure would this narration of Pythias have made, if thrown into action! The circumstances are in themselves as truly comick as those of any scene in this excellent play; and it would be well worth while to follow Laches into the house, to be present at the ridiculous distress and confusion which his presence must occasion. There is however, much more to be commended, and even imitated, than censured in the construction of this last act. All that passes between Pythias, Parmeno, and Laches, is truly admirable. You've made within.—I swear, I always thought That you had been a shrewd, sharp, cunning fellow. What! to believe directly what I told you! Or was you prick'd in conscience for the sin The young man had committed thro' your means, That you must after tell his father of him? How d'ye suppose he felt, when old Grey-beard Surpriz'd him in that habit?—What! you find That you're undone. [laughing heartily. Par. What's this, Impertinence? Was it a lie, you told me? D'ye laugh still? Is't such a jest to make fools of us, hag? Pyth. Delightful! [laughing. Par. If you don't pay dearly for it!— Pyth. Perhaps so. [laughing. Par. I'll return it. Pyth. Oh, no doubt on't. [laughing. But what you threaten Parmeno, is distant: You'll be truss'd up to-day; who first draw in A raw young lad to sin, and then betray him. They'll both conspire to make you an example. [laughing. Par. I'm done for. Pyth. Take this, slave as a reward For the fine gift you sent us; so, farewell! [Exit Pythias. Par. I've been a fool indeed; and like a rat, Betray'd myself to-day by my own squeaking. SCENE VIII. With the entrance of Laches into the house of Thais, and in consequence of it, his consent to the marriage of Chærea with Pamphila, the Fable of the Eunuch is certainly concluded: and all that follows, like the last Scene of the Andrian, is but the lame completion of an Episode, limping after the main action. In the four first acts the adventures of Thraso are so artfully interwoven with the other business of the play, that they are fairly blended and incorporated with the fable of the Eunuch: but here we perceive that though our Author has got rid of one of Menander's pieces, the other, the Colax, still hangs heavy on his hands. Was an author to form his play on twenty different pieces, if he could melt them all down into one action, there would be no impropriety: but if he borrows only from Two, whenever the episode ceases to act as one of the necessary springs of the main action, it becomes redundant, and the Unity of the Action (perhaps the only Unity, which ought never to be violated) is destroyed. Thraso, says Donatus, is brought back again, in order to be admitted to some share in the good graces of Thais, that he may not be made unhappy at the end of the play: but surely it is an essential part of the Poetical Justice of Comedy to expose coxcombs to ridicule, and to punish them, though without any shocking severity, for their follies.Enter THRASO, GNATHO, [Parmeno behind. Gnat. What now? in what hope, or with what design Advance we hither? what adventure, Thraso? Thraso. What do I mean?—To Thais to surrender On her own terms? Gnat. Indeed? Thraso. Indeed: why not, As well as Hercules to Omphale? Gnat. A fit example.—Wou'd I might behold There was no doubt at Athens some Comedy of the Loves of Hercules and Omphale; in which the Heroe was represented with a distaff by the side of his mistress, who broke his head with her slipper. To which Gnatho alludes in this place. Dacier.Your head broke with her slipper! [aside.] But her doors Creak, and fly open. Thraso. 'Sdeath! what mischief now? I ne'er so much as saw this face before. Why bursts he forth with such alacrity? SCENE IX. Enter CHÆREA at another part of the Stage. Chær. Lives there, my countrymen, a happier man To-day than I?—Not one.—For on my head The Gods have plainly emptied all their store, On whom they've pour'd a flood of bliss at once. Par. What's he so pleas'd at? Chær. seeing him.] Oh my Parmeno! Inventor, undertaker, perfecter Of all my pleasures, know'st thou my good fortunes? Know'st thou my Pamphila's a citizen? Par. I've heard so. Chær. Know'st thou, she's betroth'd my wife? Par. Oh brave, by heav'n! Gnat. Hear you, what he says? [to Thraso. Chær. Then I rejoice, my brother Phædria's love Is quietly secur'd to him for ever: We're now one family: and Thais has Found favour with my father, and resign'd Herself to us for patronage and care. Par. She's then entirely Phædria's? Chær. Ay, entirely. Par. Another cause of joy: the Captain routed! Chær. See, Parmeno, my brother (wheresoe'er He be) know this, as soon as possible! Par. I'll see if he's at home. [Exit. Thraso. Hast any doubt, Gnatho, but I'm entirely ruin'd? Gnat. None at all. Chær. What shall I mention first? whom praise the most? Him that advis'd this action? or myself That durst to undertake it?—or extol Fortune, the governess of all, who deign'd, Events so many, of such moment too, So happily to close within one day? Or shall I praise my father's frank good-humour, And gay festivity?—Oh, Jupiter, Make but these blessings sure! SCENE X. Enter PHÆDRIA. Phæ. Oh heavenly powers! What wond'rous things has Parmeno just told me! But where's my brother? Chær. Here he is. Phæd. I'm happy. Chær. I dare believe you are; and trust me, brother, Nought can be worthier of your love than Thais: Our family are all much bounden to her. Phæd. So! you'd need sing her praise to me! Thraso. Confusion! As my hope dies, my love increases. Gnatho, Your help! my expectation's all in you. Gnat. What would you have me do? Thraso. Accomplish this; By pray'r, by purchase, that I still may have Some little share in Thais. Gnat. A hard task! Thraso. Do but incline to do't, you can, I know. Effect it, and demand whatever gift, Whate'er reward you please, it shall be your's. Gnat. Indeed? Thraso. Indeed. Gnat. If I accomplish this, I claim, that you agree to throw your doors, Present or absent, always open to me; A welcome uninvited guest for ever. Thraso. I pawn my honour as the pledge. Gnat. I'll try. Phæd. What voice is that? Oh, Thraso! Thraso. Gentlemen, Good day! Phæd. Perhaps you're not acquainted yet, With what has happen'd here? Thraso. I am. Phæd. Why then Do I behold you in these territories? Thraso. Depending on— Phæd. Depend on nought but this! Captain, I give you warning, if, henceforth, I ever find you in this street, although You tell me, “I was looking for another, “I was but passing through,” expect no quarter. Gnat. Oh fie! that is not handsome. Phæd. I have said it. Gnat. You cannot be so rude. Phæd. It shall be so. Gnat. First grant me a short hearing: if you like What I propose, agree to 't. Phæd. Let us hear! Gnat. Do you retire a moment, Thraso! [Thraso retires.] First, I must beseech you both, most firmly think, That I, whate'er I do in this affair, For my own sake I do it: But if that Likewise advantage you, not to agree In you were folly. Phæd. What is't, you propose? Gnat. I think you should admit the Captain, as Your rival. Phæd. How? admit him? Gnat. Nay consider! Phædria, you live at a high rate with Her, Revel, and feast, and stick at no expence. Yet what you give's but little, and you know 'Tis needful Thais should receive much more. Now to supply your love without your cost, A fitter person, one more form'd, can't be Than Thraso is: First, he has wherewithal To give, and gives most largely: A fool too, A dolt, a block, that snores out night and day; Nor can you fear she'll e'er grow fond of him; And you may drive him hence whene'er you please. Phæd. What shall we do? [to Chærea. Gnat. Moreover this; the which I hold no trifle, no man entertains More nobly or more freely. Phæd. I begin To think we've need of such a fool. Chær. And I. Gnat. Well judg'd! and let me beg one favour more; Admit me of your family!—I have Roll'd this stone long enough. Pleasant allusion to the fable of Sisyphus. Donatus. Phæd. We do admit you. Chær. With all our hearts. Gnat. And you, sirs, in return, Facetiously said in the character of the Parasite, who discourses in convivial terms. Donatus.Shall pledge me in the Captain; eat him; drink him: And laugh at him. Chær. A bargain! Phæd. I cannot think that this play, excellent as it is in almost all other respects, concludes consistently with the manners of Gentlemen: there is a meanness in Phædria and Chærea consenting to take Thraso into their society with a view of fleecing him, which the Poet should have avoided. Cooke. The consent of Laches to the continuance of his Son's connection with Thais is also so repugnant to modern manners, that Fontaine found himself obliged to change that circumstance in his imitation of this Comedy.'Tis his due. Gnat. Thraso, whene'er you please, approach! Thraso. Pray now, How stands the case? Gnat. Alas! they knew you not: But when I drew your character, and prais'd Your worth, according to your deeds and virtues, I gain'd my point. Thraso. 'Tis well: I'm much oblig'd; I ne'er was any where, in all my life, But all folks lov'd me dearly. Gnat. Did not I Say, he had all the Attick Elegance? Phæd. He is the very character you drew. Gnat. Retire then.—Ye, [to the audience.] farewell, and clap your hands!</field>
