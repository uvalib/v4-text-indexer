      <field name="fulltext">A Midsummer Night's Dream, WRITTEN BY Shakspeare: WITH ALTERATIONS, ADDITIONS, AND NEW SONGS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. The last representation of âA Midsummer Night's Dream,â was in 1763, and the alterations and additions then introduced, were said to have been by Colman and Garrick; but whoever will read the Play, as published by Tonson in that year, must doubt much whether either of those Gentlemen could have been concerned in so inefficient a production: for notwithstanding the support of a strong Company âof expensive Decorationsâand of Music by Arne, Burney, and Handel, âA Midsummer Night's Dream,â was coldly received on the first night, and after the second night, was totally withdrawn. Such a Drama meeting with such a reception, seems extraordinary; but may probably have arisen from the two following causes:âfirst, from several of the most poetical passages having been omitted, particularly those in the characters of Titania, Oberon, and the other Fairies, who were all acted by children;â secondly, from disappointment in that part of the plot, which related to Quince, Bottom, and the other âhard-handed men of Athens,â who, though they so decidedly led the Audience to expect the performance of a Play, never performed any Play at all. Whether the alteration of 1816, will be thought to possess more or less merit than that of 1763, of course I cannot anticipate; but I trust I have not failed in my chief object, namely, the preservation of all Shakspeare's beauties;âand though it may be said, that his name is degraded, by his lines being interwoven with those of a modern Dramatist, (for I have not only been compelled to alter, transpose, introduce new Songs, and new Speeches, but also to write the whole of one additional Scene, and part of another); yet I do flatter myself, there is still critical candour enough to acknowledge, that I have made some atonement for my own defects, by restoring to the Stage, the lost, but divine Drama, of âA Midsummer Night's Dream.â F. REYNOLDS. Warren Street, January 19, 1816.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Grand Doric Colonnade appertaining to Duke Theseus' Palace. [March.] Enter Theseus and Hippolita, with Attendants. Thes. Now, fair Hippolita, our nuptial hour Draws on apace; four happy days bring in Another moon: but, Oh, methinks how slow This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires, Like to a step-dame, or a dowager, Long withering out a young man's revenue. Hip. Four days will quickly steep themselves in nights; And then the moon, like to a silver bow, New bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities. Thes. Go, Philostrate, Stir up th' Athenian youth to merriments; Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth; Turn melancholy forth to funerals: The pale companion is not for our pomp. Hippolita, I woo'd thee with my sword, And won thy love, doing thee injuries: But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling. Away! (To Philostrate.) [Exit Philos. And thou, (to an Officer) go seek the forester: My Love shall hear the music of my hounds, And shall confess, a cry more tuneable, Was never halloo'd to, nor cheer'd with horn, In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly! [Exit Officer. Enter an Officer. Officer. My liege, Egeus, and his daughter Hermia, Intreat an audience. Thes. Egeus! ever, ever welcome! Officer. And with them come, my liege, the Lords Lysander and Demetrius. Thes. Give all free entrance. [Flourish without.] Enter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander, and Demetrius. Egeus. Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke! Thes. Thanks, good Egeus; what's the news with thee? Egeus. Full of vexation, come I with complaint Against my child, my daughter Hermia. Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble Lord, This man hath my consent to marry her. Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke, This man has witched the bosom of my child; Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me, To stubborn harshness; and, my noble Lord, Be 't so, she will not here, before your Grace, Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens, As she is mine, I may dispose of her; Which shall be either to this gentleman, Or to her death, according to our law. Thes. What say you, Hermia? be advis'd, fair maid. To you your father should be as a god, One, who compos'd your beautiesâyea, and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted; and within his power To leave the figure, or disfigure it. Demetrius is a worthy gentleman. Her. So is Lysander. Thes. In himself he is; But in this kind, wanting your father's voice, The other must be held the worthier. Her. I do intreat your Grace to pardon me: I know not by what pow'r I am made bold In such a presence here to plead my thoughts: But I beseech your Grace, that I may know The worst that may befal, if I refuse To wed Demetrius? Thes. Either to die, or to abjure For ever the society of men; Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires, Whether, not yielding to your father's choice, You can brave death, or can endure For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd, And live a barren sister all your life? Thrice blessed they, that master so their blood, But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd, Than that which withering on the virgin thorn, Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness. Her. So will I grow, so live, so die, my Lord, Ere I will yield my virgin heart and hand Unto Demetrius, to whose unwish'd yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty. Thes. Take time to pause, and by the next new moon, (The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,) Upon that day, either prepare to die, For disobedience to your father's will, Or else to wed Demetrius; or protest A single life, on chaste Diana's altar. Dem. Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield. Lys. You have her father's love, Demetrius; Let me have Hermia's;âdo you marry him. Egeus. Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love; And what is mine, my love shall render him. Lys. I am, my Lord, as well deriv'd as he, As well possest: my love is more than his: My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd; And, which is more than all, I'm lov'd of Hermia, Why should not I then prosecute my right? Demetrius sought Nedar's daughter, Helena, And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, doats, Devoutly doats, doats in idolatry, Upon this spotted and inconstant man. Thes. I must confess that I have heard so muchâ Have heard Demetrius was betroth'd to Helena, and thought t'have spoke thereof; But being over-full of self-affairs, My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come, And come, Egeus, you shall go with me; I have some private schooling for you both. For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father's will; Or else the law of Athens yields you up To death, or to a vow of single life. Come, my Hippolita. [Flourish.] [Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia. Lys. Hermia, for aught that ever I could read, Could ever hear by tale or history, The course of true love never did run smooth, But either it was different in blood, Or else misgrafted in respect of years, Or else it stood upon the choice of friends; Or if there were a sympathy in choice, War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it, Making it momentary as a sound, Swift as a shadow, short as any dream, Brief as the lightning in the collied night, That (in a spleen) unfolds both heav'n and earth; And ere a man hath pow'r to say, behold! The jaws of darkness do devour it up; So quick bright things come to confusion. Her. If then true lovers have been ever crost, Oh, let us teach our trial, patience. Lys. A good persuasion; therefore hear me, Hermia: I have a widow-aunt, a dowager, From Athens is her house remote, seven leagues; There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee, And to that place the sharp Athenian law, Cannot pursue us. If thou lov'st me, then, Steal forth to-morrow night; and in the wood Where I did meet thee once with Helena, To do observance to the morn of May, There will I stay for thee. Her. My good Lysander, I swearâ SONGâHermia.â[Bishop.] By the simplicity of Venus' doves! By that which knitteth souls, and prospers loves! In that same place thou hast appointed me, To-morrow truly will I meet with thee! By all the vows that ever men have broke! In number more than ever women spoke! In that same place thou hast appointed me, To-morrow truly will I meet with thee! [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Room in Quince's House. Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout, and Starveling. Quin. Is all our company here? Bot. You were best to call them generally; man by man, according to the scrip. Quin. Here is the scrowl of every man's name, which is thought fit through all Athens to play in our Interlude before the Duke and Duchess, on his wedding-day at night. Bot. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors, and so grow on to a point. Quin. Marry, our play is the most lamentable Comedy, and most cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisby. Bot. A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scrowl. Masters, spread yourselves. Quin. Answer as I call you: Nick Bottom, the weaver! Bot. Ready: name what part I am for, and proceed. Quin. You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus. Bot. What is Pyramus, a lover, or a tyrant? Quin. A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love. Bot. That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. Yet, my chief humour is for a tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split. âThe raging rocks, âWith shivering shocks, âShall break the locks âOf prison gates; âAnd Phibbus' car âShall shine from far, âAnd make and mar âThe foolish fates.â This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is more condoling. Quin. Francis Flute, the bellows-mender. Flute. Here, Peter Quince. Quin. Flute, you must take Thisby on you. Flute. What is Thisby, a wandering knight? Quin. It is the lady that Pyramus must love. Flute. Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming. Quin. That's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak small as you will. Bot. An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too; I'll speak in a monstrous little voice: Thisne, Thisne, ah, Pyramus my lover dear, thy Thisby dear, and lady dear. Quin. No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby. Bot. Well, proceed. Quin. Robert Starveling, the tailor. Star. Here, Peter Quince. Quin. Robert Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.âTom Snout, the tinker. Snout. Here, Peter Quince. Quin. You, Pyramus's father; myself, Thisby's father, and Prologue; Snug the joiner, you the Lion's part;âI hope there is a play fitted. Snug. Have you the Lion's part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study. Quin. You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring. Bot. Let me play the Lion too, I will roar, that it will do any man's heart good to hear me. I will roar, that I will make the Duke say, let him roar again, let him roar again! Quin. If you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek, and that were enough to hang us all. All. That would hang us every mother's son. Bot. I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any nightingale. Quin. You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet-fac'd man, a proper man as one shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely, gentleman-like man: therefore you must needs play Pyramus. Bot. I will; but what beard were I best to discharge it in? your straw-colour'd beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-colour'd beardâyour perfect yellowâ Quin. Discharge it in your ownâa red beard! but, masters, here are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and desire you to con them by to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace-wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there we will rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dog'd with company, and our devices known. In the mean time, I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not. Bot. We will meet, and there we may rehearse more obscenely, and courageously. Take pains, be perfect, and if King Theseus don't prefer on us all sixpence a day, I'll be hang'd, we deserve it.âExit omnesâAdieu! Quin. At the Duke's oak we meet. Bot. Aye; but hold ye, hold ye, neighbours; are your voices in order, and your tunes ready? Quin. Aye, aye, nothing goes down so well as a little of your long quaver. Bot. Therefore let's be in our airs, and rehearse our Epilogue. Clear up your pipes! are you all ready? All. Aye, aye. Bot. Now make your reverency, and begin. SONGâFor Epilogue.â[Arne.] Quin. Most noble Duke, to us be kind; Be you and all your Courtiers blind, That you may not our errors find, But smile upon our sport; For we are simple Actors all, Some fat, some lean, some short, some tall; Our pride is great, our merit small; Will that, pray, do at Court? Snout. The writer too of this same piece, Like other poets here of Greece, May think all swans, that are but geese, And spoil your princely sport. Six honest folks we are, no doubt, But scarce know what we've been about, And tho' we're honest, if we're out, That will not do at Court. Bot. O would the Duke and Duchess smile, The Court would do the same awhile, But call us after, low and vile, And that way make their sport: Nay, would you still more pastime make, And at poor we your purses shake. Whate'er you give, we'll gladly take; For that will do at Court. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Wood. Moonlight. Enter 2nd Fairy, meeting another Fairy. 4th Fairy. How now, Spirit! Whither wander you? 2nd Fairy. Over hill, over dale, Through bush, through brier, Over park, over pale; Through flood, through fire, I do wander every where, Swifter than the moon's sphere; And I serve the Fairy Queen To dew her orbs upon the green: I must go seek some dew-drops here, And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. AIRâ2nd Fairy.â[Dr. Cooke, and Bishop.] King cup, daffodil, and rose, Shall the fairy wreath compose; Beauty, sweetness, and delight, Crown our revels of the night: Lightly trip it o'er the green, Where the Fairy ring is seen. So no one step of earthly tread, Shall offend our lady's head. Virtue sometimes droops her wing, Beauty's bee may lose her sting, Fairy land can both combine Roses with the eglantine: Lightly be your measure seen, Deftly footed o'er the green; Nor a spectre's baleful head Peep at our nocturnal tread. Farewell, thou wand'ring spirit! I'll begone; Our Queen and all her elves come here anon. But soft! who's this? [Looks out.] Why, ay, is it not he, That frights the maidens of the villagerie? Who bootless makes the breathless housewife churn Skim-milk, and sometimes labour in the quern; And sometimes makes the drink to bear no barm, Misleads night-wand'rers, laughing at their harm? Those that âHobgoblinâ call him, and âsweet Puck,â He does their work, and they shall have goodluck. Enter Puck, or, Robin-Good-fellow. Puck. So, false Titania's elf!â 2nd Fairy. And thou, false Oberon's. I know you are that shrewd and knavish sprite, Call'd Robin Good-fellow. Puck. Thou speak'st aright; I am that merry wand'rer of the night: I jest to Oberon, and make him smile, Oft' lurk in gossip's bowl, and her beguile In very likeness of a roasted crab; And when she drinks, against her lips I bob, And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale: The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me; Then slip I from her seatâdown topples she, And rails, or cries, and falls into a cough; And then, the whole choir hold their hips, and loffe, And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear, A merrier hour was never wasted there; But, know, the King doth keep his revels here to-night, Take heed the Queen come not within his sight: For they do square, that all their Elves, for fear, Creep into acorn-cups, and hide them there. 2nd Fairy. But why is Oberon so fell and wrath? Puck. Because, that she, as her attendant, hath A lovely boy, stol'n from an Indian king; And she perforce withholds the changeling, Tho' jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild. But make room, fairy, here comes Oberon. 2nd Fairy. And here my mistress: would that he were gone! [A March.] Enter, in procession, Oberon, King of the Fairies, at one Wing, with his Train, and the Queen at another, with hers.âTitania is in a Car. âOberon in another Car. Ober. Ill met by moon-light, proud Titania! Queen. What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence; (as going.) I have foresworn his bed and company. Ober. Tarry, rash wanton! Am not I thy lord? Queen. Then I must be thy lady: why art thou here, Come from the farthest steep of India? But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, Your buskin'd mistress, and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded; and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity. Ober. How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania, Glance at my credit with Hippolita, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus? Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigune, whom he ravished, And make him, with fair Ãgle, break his faith With Ariadne, and Antiopa? Queen. These are the forgeries of jealousy: And never since that middle summer's spring Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead, To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport. The spring, the summer, The chiding autumn, angry winter, change Their wonted liveries; and the amazed world By their increase now knows not which is which; And this same progeny of evil comes From our debate, from our dissention; We are their parents and original. Ober. Do you amend it then, it lies in you. Why should Titania cross her Oberon? I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my henchman. Queen. Set your heart at rest, The fairy land buys not the child of me. His mother was a vot'ress of my order, And in the spiced Indian air by night Full often she hath gossip'd by my side; And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands, Marking th' embarked traders of the flood, When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive, And grow all pregnant with the wanton wind; Which she, with pretty, and with swimming gait, Would imitate, and sail upon the land, To fetch me trifles, and return again As from a voyage, rich with merchandize; But she being mortal, of that boy did die, And for her sake I do rear up her boy, And for her sake I will not part with him. Ober. Where is the youthful treasure? Queen. Still hid in India, far, far from Oberon's power. Farewell! Ober. How long within this wood intend you stay? Queen. Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day. If you will patiently dance in our round, And see our moon-light revels, go with us! If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts. Ober. Give me that boy, and I will go with thee. Queen. Not for thy Fairy kingdom. [March renewed.] [Queen and Train, Exeunt. Ober. Well, go thy way; thou shalt not from this grove, Till I torment thee for this injury. My gentle Puck, come hither; thou remember'st, Since once I sat upon a promontory, And heard a mermaid, on a dolphin's back, Uttering such dulcet and harmonious sounds, That the rude sea grew civil at her song, And certain stars shot madly from their spheres, To hear the sea-maid's music. Puck. I remember. Ober. That very time I saw, but thou couldst not, Flying between the cold moon and the earth, Cupid all arm'd! a certain aim he took At a fair vestal, throned by the west, And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow, As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts: But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft Quench'd in the chaste beam of the watery moon! And the imperial vot'ress passed on, In maiden meditation, fancy freeâ Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell: It fell upon a little western flower,â Before milk-white, now purple with love's wounds, And maidens call it love-in-idleness! Fetch me that flower,âthe herb I shew'd thee once; The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid, Will make or man or woman madly doat Upon the next live creature that it sees. Fetch me that herb, and be thou here again Ere the Leviathan can swim a league. Puck. I'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes. [Exit. Ober. Having once this juice, I'll watch Titania when she is asleep, And drop the liquor of it in her eyes: The next thing which she waking looks upon, (Be it bear, lion, wolf, bull, ape or monkey), She shall pursue it with the soul of love: And ere I take this charm off from her sight, (As I can take it with another herb), I'll make her render up her Page to me. But who comes here? I am invisible, And I will over-hear their conference. Enter Demetrius, Helena following him. Dem. Where is Lysander? Where is Hermia? The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me! Thou told'st me they had stolen to this wood. Hel. I did, Demetrius, and hop'd to have your thanks. Dem. My frowns, my scorn! Hence, Helena, pursue me not. Hel. You draw me onâI cannot help but follow. Dem. Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair? Or rather do I not in plainest truth, Tell you I do not, and I cannot love you? Hel. Neglect me,âspurn meâonly give me leave, Unworthy as I am, to follow you! Dem. I'll run from thee, and hide me in the brakes. SONGâDemetrius.â[Bishop.] Recall the minutes that are fled, Forbid fleet time to move, To new life wake the sleeping dead, But ne'er recall my love. Forbid the stormy waves to roar, The playful winds to rove, Revive the sun at midnight hour, But ne'er recall my love. [Exit Demet. Hel. He seeks his Hermia, and she, injurious, Most ungrateful maid, e'en she conspires against me! Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd, The sister-vows, the hours that we have spent, When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting usâOh! and is all forgot? All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence? We Hermia, like two artificial Gods, Created with our needles both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one songâboth in one keyâ As if our hands, our hearts, voices, and minds Had been incorporate. So we grew together, Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, But yet an union in partition! And now!âBut where's Demetrius?âStill I Must followâstill reverse the fabled chaseâ Apollo flies,âbut Daphne holds the race! [Exit. Ober. Fare thee well, nymph! ere he doth leave this grove, Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love. Enter Puck. Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer! Puck. Ay, there it is. Ober. I pray thee, give it me, I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows, Where ox-lips and the nodding violet grows; There sleeps Titania some times of the night, Lull'd in these flow'rs, with dances and delight; And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes, And make her full of hateful fantasies. Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove: A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes; But do it when the next thing he espies May be the Ladyâfor when he awakes, The first he sees, the first his love partakes. Go, and rememberâThou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on. Puck. By his Athenian garments? Ober. Ay; and look you meet me ere the first cock crow. Puck. Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so. Ober. Now with all speed to charm Titania. INVOCATIONâOberon.â[Bishop.] Spirits, advance! your nightly pastimes leave, For proud Titania doth her lord deceive. Spirits, advance! through air and ocean move! 'Tis Oberon calls you, to assert his love. Enter a Troop of Fairies. AIRâ1st Fairy.â[Bishop.] Come, follow, follow me, Ye Fairy Elves that be! O'er tops of dewy grass So nimbly do we pass, The young and tender stalk, Ne'er bends where we do walk. QUARTETTO AND CHORUS.â[Dr. Cooke.] Trip away, trip away! Make no stay, Meet we all by break of day. [Bishop.] We follow, follow thee, We Fairy Elves that be! END OF ACT I.</field>

Come, now a roundel, and a Fairy song; Then for the third part of a minute hence, Some, to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds, Some, war with rear-mice for their leathern wings, To make my small elves coats; and some keep back The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, and wonders, At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep; Then to your offices, and let me rest. (Goes to the Bower, and lies down.) QUARTETTOâFairies.â[Stevens.] You spotted snakes, with double tongue, Thorny hedge-hogs, be not seen; Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong, Come not near our Fairy Queen?

Weaving spiders, come not here; Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence! Beetles black approach not near, Worm nor snail do no offence. Philomel, &amp;c. [Exeunt Fairies. Enter Oberon. Ober. What thou see'st when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true love take;â Love, and languish for his sake!â Be it ounce, or cat, or bear, Pard, or boar with bristled hair! In thy eye what shall appear, When thou wak'st, it is thy dear! Wake when some vile thing is near!â [Pours the Juice in Titania's Eye, and Exit. SCENE II. Another part of the Wood. Enter Lysander and Hermia. Lys. Fair love, you faint with wand'ring in the wood; And to speak truth, I have forgot our way. We'll rest us, Hermia, And tarry for the comfort of the morn. Herm. Be't so, Lysander; here's my resting place, Whilst you upon that bank repose, That if perchance my woman's fears shou'd seek Protection in thy love and bravery, I may not call on love and thee in vain. Lys. Repose thee, love; I'll watch thee thro' the night. No harm shall reach theeâ Sleep give thee all his rest. Herm. With half that wish the wisher's eyes be prest. [They sleep.] Enter Puck. Puck. Thro' the forest have I gone, But Athenian find I none; Night and silence!âHere is one! With Athenian garments on! But soft!âand nearerâyes! I swear, The very garments he doth wear! This is he, my master said, Despised the Athenian maid! And here the maiden sleeping sound, Upon the dank and dirty ground. Pretty soul! she durst not lie, Near this lack-love, kill-courtesie! But first I'll throw into a trance This youth, that elves may round him dance: Melting sounds your power impart, That I may pierce his harden'd heart! [Soft Music.] Lys. Whence is this sweet enchanting harmony! A thicker shade o'erspreads the night! my senses, Some secret, unknown influence feelsâ I cannot shake it off; chains invisible Already bind my limbs, and all my powers enthrall. [He sinks down.] Puck. 'Tis done, 'tis done! and now my skill His breast with other love shall fill: Churl, upon thy eyes I throw All the power this charm doth owe: [Dropping the Juice in Lysander's Eye.] So awake, when I am gone; For I must now to Oberon. [Exit. Enter Helena, hastily. Hel. Still, still Demetrius, wilt thou darkling leave me? O, I am out of breath in this fond chase; The more my prayer, the lesser is my favour, But who is here? Lysander on the ground: Dead, or asleep? Lysander, if you live, good Sir, awake. Lys. Who's there? Hel. 'Tis Iâ'tis Helena! Lys. I seeâ(rising) Sweet! beauteous, heavenly Helena! Where is Demetrius? Oh, how fit a word Is that vile name, to perish on this sword? Hel. Do not say so? What though he loves your Hermia, Yet Hermia still loves you. Be satisfied. Lys. Content with Hermia? no: Reason becomes the marshal to my will, And leads me to your eyes, where I can read Love's stories written in love's richest book! I'll run through fire for thee, sweet Helena! Hel. But, wherefore this? When, at your hands, did I deserve this scorn? Is 't not enough, Lysander, That I did never, no, nor ever can, Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius, But you must mock my insufficiency? Farewell, my Lord, and may your Hermia teach you More true gentleness. [Exit Helena. Lys. My Hermia! (sarcastically) Sleep thou there! For, as the heresies that men do quit, Are hated most of those they did deceive; So thou, my heresy, a long good-night! The star I follow, is lov'd Helen's light. [Exit. Herm. Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best, To pluck this crawling serpent from my bosom. Ah me, for pity! what a dream was here! Lysander, look how I do quake with horror. Methought a serpent ate my heart away, And you sate smiling at him. Ha! Lysander, Lysander! what remov'd? Lysander, Lord! Alack, where are you? Speak, and if you hear meâ (Bird Symphony.) He cannot for these harbingers of morningâ cease, sylvan songsters, cease! while your tuneful notes thus vibrate through the wood, in vain I call upon my lost, lost love!

[Exit. SCENE III. The Wood. Bower. Duke's Oak. Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout, and Starveling. (The Queen of the Fairies lying asleep.) Bot. Are we all met? Quin. Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place. This green plot shall be our stage; this hawthorn brake our trying-house, and tonight we will only do it in action; but our next rehearsal shall be full court-dress'd, as we will do it before the Duke. Bot. Peter Quince! Quin. What say'st thou, Bully Bottom? Bot. There are things in this Comedy of Pyramus and Thisby, that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot abide;âhowever, peradventure, this may be quantified by my delicate colouring;âbut the Lion!âwill not the ladies tremble at the Lion? Snug. By'r laken, a parlous fear! Quin. I believe we must leave the Lion out, when all is done. Bot. Ay, masters, you ought to consider with yourselves;âto bring in, Heaven shield us! a Lion amongst ladies, is a most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your Lion, living!âand we ought to look to it. Quin. We'll have two Prologues,âthe one that's written, and another to tell he is not a Lion. Bot. Nay, there's only thisâyou must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the Lion's neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect: Ladies, or fair Ladies, my life for yours! if you think I came hither as a Lion, it were pity of my life: I am no such thing! I am a man, as other men are;âand there indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly, he is no Lion, but Snug the joiner. Quin. Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard things, that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for you know, Pyramus and Thisby met by moonlight. Bot. Hard!âthat's all hereâ(Pointing to his head)âOne must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern; and say he comes to disfigure, or present, the person of Moonshine. Quin. Good! but there is another hard thingâ We must have a wall in the great chamber, for Pyramus and Thisby, as the story goes, did make love through the chink of a wall. Flute. You can never bring in a wall. All. Never! Bot. Can't we? bless you!â(Smiling contemptuously.) âCan't some man or other present Wall? and let him have some lome, or some rough-cast about him, to signify Wall;âand can't he hold his fingers thus? and through the cranny shan't Pyramus and Thisby whisper? They shall; and so, Snout, you're the Wall. Quin. If that may be, then all is well.âCome, sit down every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.âPyramus, you begin; and when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake, and so every one according to his cue. Enter Puck. Puck. What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here? So near the cradle of our Fairy Queen? What, a Play tow'rd; I'll be an auditor; An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause. Quin. Speak, Pyramus.âThisby, stand forth. Bot. Thisby, the flower of odious savours, sweet,â Quin. Odours, odours! Bot. Odours savours sweet; So doth thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear,â But, hark! I see a voice!âstay thou but here, And by and by, I will to thee appear. [Exit Pyramus. Puck. A stranger Pyramus than e'er play'd here. [Exit Puck. Flute. Must I speak now? Quin. Ay, marry must you; for you understand, he goes but to see the noise, and is to come again. Flute. Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue, Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier, Most briskly juvenale, and eke most lovely Jew, As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire; I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb. Quin. Ninus' tomb, man! why, you must not speak that yet:âthat you answer to Pyramus; you speak all your part at once, cues and all.âPyramus, prepareâyour cue isâânever tire.â Flute. Oh! as true as truest horse that yet would never tire. Bot. [Without.] I come!â Flute. He comes, all lovely, beautiful, and brave! Enter Bottom, with an Ass's Head on.âPuck behind, waving his Wand, then instantly retiring. Bot. Sweet love!âin thy fond arms,â (As he is about to embrace ThisbyâFlute and all look up, and show horror and astonishment.) Quin. Oh! monstrous!âOh, strange!âwe are haunted,âpray, mastersâfly, masters! help!â [Exeunt all but Bottom. Bot. Holloa!âWhat do you run away for?â Sure, 'tis a knavery of theirs, to make me afeard. Re-enter Flute. Flute. Oh, Bottom!âthou art chang'd!âI see on thee a new head! Bot. And I see on thee, thy old head! an Ass's head! Re-enter Quince. Quin. Bless thee, Bottom!âbless thee!âthou art translated. [Exeunt Quin. and Flute. Bot. I see they'd fright me if they could; but I will not stir: I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, and they shall hear I am not afraid. AIRâBottom. The ousel-cock, so black of hue, With orange-tawny bill; The throstle with his note so true, The wren with little quill. Queen. What angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed? (Advancing from the Bower, Bottom not seeing her) Sings again. The finch, the sparrow, and the lark, The plain-song cuckow grey; Whose note full many a man doth mark, And dares not answer, nay. Queen. I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again, Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note; So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape, On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee. Bot. Love me!âmadâstark-staringâQuince! Snout! [Going, Titania lays hold of him.] Queen. Out of this wood, do not desire to go! Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no. I am a Spirit of no common rate; And I do doat on theeâso, go with me, I'll give thee Fairies to attend on thee; And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep, And sing while thou on pressed flow'rs doth sleep: Peaseblossom, Cob, Moth, Mustardseed! Enter Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, Mustardseed, and other Fairies. 1st Fairy. Ready. 2nd Fairy. And I. 3rd Fairy. And I. 4th Fairy. And I. Queen. Be kind and courteous to this gentleman, Hop in his walks, and gambol in his eyes; Feed him with apricots and dewberries! The honey-bags steal from the humble bees, And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs, And light them at the fairy glow-worm's eyes, To have my love to bed, and to arise; Nod to him, Elves, and do him courtesies. Bot. Cobweb! if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you, good Master Cobweb.âPeaseblossom! commend me to Master Peascod your father, and Mrs. Squash your mother!âMustardseed! though your kindred hath made my eyes water e'er now, I desire more of your acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed!âOh Love!â(Turning to Titania.) CHORUS. [Music.] 1st Fairy. Hail, mortal, hail! 2nd Fairy. Hail! 3rd Fairy. Hail! [Fairies sing and dance round Bottom, laying hold of his Handsâhe dances with them, and all Exeunt. SCENE IV. The Wood. Enter Oberon. Ober. I wonder if Titania be awak'd; Then what it was that next came in her eye, Which she must doat on in extremity. Enter Puck. Here comes my messenger! How now, mad sprite! What night-rule now about this haunted grove? Puck. My mistress with a monster is in love. Near to her close and consecrated bower, While she was in her dull and sleeping hour, A crew of patches rude, rehears'd a play Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day. An ass's nole I fix'd upon one head, And all the rest with fear distracted fled. When, in that moment (so it came to pass) Titania wak'd, and straitway lov'd an Ass. Ober. This falls out better than I could devise. But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes With the love-juice, as I bid thee do? Puck. I took him sleeping; that is finish'd too. Enter Demetrius and Hermia. Ober. Stand closeâthis is the same Athenian. Puck. This is the woman, but not this the man. Dem. O, why rebuke you him that loves you so? Her. Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse, For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse thee. Seek, seek fair Helena! Dem. Call you her fair? that fair, again unsay. Oh! teach her how you look, and with what art You sway the motions of Demetrius' heart! SONG.âDemetrius. Oh! happy Fair! Oh, Hermia! happy Fair! Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue's sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear, When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear. Her. If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, O, kill me too! The sun was not so true unto the day, As he to me. Would he have stol'n from hence, From sleeping Helena? It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him. Dem. Why, gentle Hermia, will you still persist, To pierce me thro' the heart with your contempt? Herm. What's this to my Lysander? Where is he? If thou hast slain him, Henceforth be never number'd among men, Thou serpent! Dem. I am not guilty of Lysander's blood, Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell. Herm. Then from thy hated presence will I go, In search of my Lysander, come what may. Dem. Nayâhear me, Hermia. DUETâDemetrius and Hermia.â[Bishop.] Demet. These looks, these tears, these tender sighs, Are these, in murd'rers found? 'Tis I'm the victim, and your eyes, Your scorn, has caus'd the wound. Herm. Ah! cease these unavailing tears, They ne'er can Hermia move! Bright hope dispels my anxious fears, And beams on faithful love. [Exit Herm. Dem. There is no following her in this fierce vein.â And worn, o'ercome with anguish and despair E'en here I'll seek repose. Yes, sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye, Steal me awhile from my own company!â [Lies down on a Bank, and sleeps.] Oberon and Puck advance. Ober. What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite, And laid thy love-juice on some true-love's sight: About the wood, go swifter than the wind, And Helena of Athens see thou find.â By some illusion see thou bring her here; And send an Elf with some of that same flow'r. Puck. I go, I go, look how I go, Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow. [Exit. Ober. I'll charm his eyes against she doth appear. Enter Fairy, with a Flower. 1st Fairy. Here is the flower. Ober. Now, now to sing the charm. [Exit Fairy. (Air.âDuring which he pours the Juice into Demetrius's Eyes.) AIRâOberon.â[Smith.] Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid's archery, Sink in apple of his eye! When his love he doth espy, Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky. When thou wak'st if she be by, Beg of her for remedy. Enter Puck. Puck. Captain of our fairy-band, Helena is here at hand, And the youth mistook by me, Pleading for a lover's fee. Shall we their fond pageant see? Lord, what fools these mortals be!â Ober. Stand aside! the noise they make, Will cause Demetrius to wake. Puck. Then will two at once woo one,â That must needs be sport alone! And these things do best please me, That befall preposterously. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Another Part of the Wood. Enter Lysander and Helena. Lys. Why should you think that I should woo in scorn? Scorn and derision never come in tears. Look, when I vow, I weep. Hel. You do advance your cunning more and more, These vows are Hermia'sâgive 'em not to me. Lys. I had no judgment when to her I swore. Hel. Nor none, in my mind, now you swear to me. Lys. Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you. Behold! he's here! (Seeing Demetrius, who awakes and rises.) Confessâ(To Demet.) Love you not Hermia? Dem. No, Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine! To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyes? Hel. O, spite! to use a simple woman thus! (Demetrius takes her hand.) Lys. Villain, forbear!â(Drawing his sword)âthis hand is mine; And here, with all good will, with all my heart, In Hermia's love I yield you my pretensions; And yours to Helena, to me bequeath, Whom I, do love to death, Demetrius. Dem. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, Lest to thy peril thou repent, Lysander: My heart to Helena is home return'd!â And here's thy love!â Enter Hermia. Herm. Found, found, Lysander!â Oh! why unkindly didst thou leave me, love? Lys. Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go? Herm. What love could press Lysander from my side? Lys. Lysander's love, his love for Helena. Fair Helena, who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery stars;â(Crosses to Helena) I swear by that which I will lose for thee, To prove him false, that says I love thee not. Dem. I say I love thee more than he can do. Lys. If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it, traitor! Now follow, if thou dar'st, to try whose right, Or thine, or mine, is most in Helena. Dem. Lead on! Lys. Away!âand the wordââHelena and Love!â [Exeunt Lysander and Demetrius. Herm. Is this illusion? Oh! false, canker-blossom; You thief of love!âWhat, have you come by night, And stol'n my love's heart from him? Hel. Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me; I evermore did love you, Hermia,â And all I can explain, I will.âBut, come away!â Let's fly, and struggle to prevent this fray. [Exeunt Hermia and Helena. Enter Oberon and Puck. Ober. Yonder they fly, and still entangl'dâcrost!â This is thy negligence; still thou mistak'st, Or else commit'st thy knaveries willingly. Puck. Believe me, King of Shadows, I mistook,â But so far blameless proves my enterprise, That you did tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on. Ober. Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight; Hie, therefore, Robin, overcast the night!â The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fogs, as black as Acheron!â And lead these testy rivals so astray, As one shall come not in the other's way. Like to Lysander sometimes frame thy tongue, Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong.â And sometimes rail thou like Demetrius,â And from each other look thou lead them thus, Till o'er their brows death counterfeiting sleep, With leaden legs, and batty wings, doth creep.â Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye,â (Producing Herb, and giving it to Puck.) Whose liquor has this virtuous property!â To take from thence all error with its might, And make his eye-balls roll with wonted sight.â When they next wake, all this derision Shall seem a dream, and fruitless vision!â Away, away! make no delayâ We may effect this business yet e'er day! [Exit Puck. I'll to my Queen, and beg her Indian boy!â Not, not so much from love of him, as her, I court this contest,âI'd put her to the trialâ If she refuse, I know her love is on the wane,â But, if she yield! Ah! that she may! and stillâ [Music.] (Clouds descend and open.âA Fairy is discovered, who chaunts the following lines.) FINALE. Fairy. Oberon! Oberon. Appear! Fairy. Oberon! no more despair! Titania wafts him to your care! Borne by each propitious gale, From India's shores her gallies sail. Nor storms, nor quicksands can they meet, For Zephyrs fan the Fairy fleet! And silv'ry seas the treasure bear,â The Boy!âthe Indian Boy is near! (Clouds begin to ascend again.) Ober. Her vessels waft him to my care, The joy I own, to all be known; And join with me, in dance and revelry! Thenâthen Titania's charmed eye release From monster's viewâand all things shall be peace. [Music.] (Clouds having ascended, the Sea is discovered. A Fairy Palace in the distance.âTitania's galley and other gallies in full sail.â DanceâDuring which, Indian Boy is brought forward.) CHORUS. Pierce the air with sounds of joy! Hail Titania's treasur'd Boy! END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Wood-Bower, Duke's OakâTitania discover'd reclining on the Shoulders of Bottom, who has the Ass's Head on, which is decorated with Flowers: they are surrounded by Peaseblossom, Mustardseed, Moth, Cobweb, and Fairies. Bot. Cobweb! Monsieur Cobweb! Cob. Ready! Bot. Good Monsieur, get your weapons, and kill me a red-hipt humble bee, and bring me the honey-bag.âPeaseblossom! Peaseb. Ready! Bot. Scratch my head, Peaseblossom, and you, Monsieur Mustardseed, help himâI must to the barber's, Monsieur; for methinks I am marvellously hairy about the face, and I am such a tender Ass, if my hair does but tickle me, I must scratch. Tit. Wilt thou have music, my sweet love? Bot. Noâfood! Tit. Bring, bring the purple grapes, green figs, and dewberries. (Peaseblossom, &amp;c. present him the different Fruits.) Bot. Oats! I could munch your good dry oats! or hay!â Oh! hay! sweet hay has no fellow! Tit. I have a venturous Fairy, that shall seek The squirrel's hoard, and bring thee rare new nuts. Bot. I'd rather have a handful or two of dried pease; but I pray you, let none of your people stir meâI've an exposition of sleep come upon me. Tit. Sleep thou; and, Fairies, tune your softest strains To lull him to repose. (Fairies sing Quartetto, during which Titania retires to her Bower, and Bottom goes to sleep on the Bank.) QUARTETTOâFairies.â[Bishop.] Welcome, welcome to this place, Fav'rite of the Fairy Queen! Zephyrs, play around his face! Wash, ye dews, his graceful mien! Pluck the wings from butterflies, To fan the moon-beams from his eyes; Round him in eternal spring, Grasshoppers merrily sing! [Exeunt Fairies. Enter Oberon. Ober. So, as good Robin saidâpoor Titania! How I lament our mutual jealousy! But, the boy mine, I'll hasten to undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes; And next to take this strange transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain, That he awaking when the others do, May all to Athens back again repair, And think no more of this night's accidents, But as the fierce vexation of a dream!â Now first I will release the Fairy Queen. AIRâOberon. Be as thou wast wont to be; See as thou wast wont to see; Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower, Has such blessed force and power. Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet Queen! Queen. My Oberon! what visions have I seen! Methought I was enamour'd, and with form So strange! so hideous! Ober. There lies your love. Queen. How came these things to pass? O how mine eyes do loath this visage now! Ober. Silence awhile. Thus I unbind the charm. (Music, during which, Ass's Head disappears.) And now, my gentle Queen, take hand with me, For thou and I are new in amity. Queen. Come, my Lord, and in our flight, Tell me how it came this night, That I, sleeping here, was found With this mortal on the ground? [Exeunt. [Music.] Bot. (Wakes.) When my cue comes, call meâ my next is,âMost fair PyramusâHey ho! Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout, the tinker! Starveling! Gads my life!âStolen hence, and left me asleep, and dreaming!âAnd such a dream! 'tis past the wit of man to say what I dreamt!âMethought I was! There's no man can tell whatâMethought I was! and methought I had!âIf man go about to expound this dream, man is but an ass. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to repeat, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dreamâ it shall be called Bottom's Dream, because it hath no bottom. Enter Quince and Snug, not seeing Bottom. Quin. O woeful hour! he's lost! and our play is lost! for who in all Athens is able to discharge Pyramus, but he? Snug. Ay, he had the best wit, the best person, and was a very paramour for a sweet voice. Bot. (Coming between them) Say paragonâa paramour is, God bless us! a thing of nought. Quin. O most courageous day! O most happy hour! Bot. Masters, I am to discourse wonders!âask me not whatâfor all I can say is, let our play go forwardâWhere's Thisby? Moonshine? Quin. Here, here they come in their way to the tyring-house, with all our properties and stage moveables. See! thy armour, my sables! Enter Starveling, Snout, and Flute, bearing in their Hands their respective Stage Properties, such as Wall, Lion's-Skin, Pyramus's Armour, &amp;c. Bot. And Wall, Lion, and all our Parfanalia. Come on. (Taking their hands.) Let's instantly comparison, and replete our rehearsal hereâour last grand buskin'd rehearsal!âAway! and if our sport end not in our being all made men! say I'm a knaveâa foolâan ass!âNo, don't say that, becauseâbecauseâOh head!âOh Bottom! (Putting his hand to his Head.) [Exit with Quince and Snug. [Horns without.] Hunting Glee and Chorusâfirst part behind Scenes; second, as they enter. CHORUS â[Bishop.] Hark! hark! each Spartan hound With music fills the sky! And hills and woodlands round, Re-echo with the cry! Enter Theseus, Philostrate, and Train, chiefly drest as Hunters. Thes. Why ay, such are our Spartan hounds, The groves, the skies, every region near Seem'd all one mutual cryâwho ever heard So musical a discord, such sweet thunder? But with the setting sun, Here end our Sylvan, not our other sports; No, till the iron-tongue of midnight shall strike twelve, Still we've a long, long ageâthree tedious hours.â Where is our usual manager of mirth? What revels are at hand? Call Philostrate. Philos. Here, mighty Theseus. Thes. Say, what abridgement have you for this evening? What mask? what music?âhow shall we beguile The lazy time, if not with some delight? Philos. There is a Brief, how many sports are ripe; Make choice of which your Highness will see first. [Giving him a Scroll.] Thes. (Reading.) âThe Riot of the Tipsy Bacchanals, Tearing the Thracian Singer in their rage!â That is an old device, and it was play'd When I from Thebes came last a Conqueror. âThe thrice-three Muses mourning for the Death Of Learning, late deceas'd in beggary.â That is some satire, keen and critical, Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony. âA tedious brief Scene of young Pyramus And his Love, Thisbyâvery Tragical Mirth!â Merry and tragical!âtedious and brief. How shall we find the concord of this discord? Philos. A play it is, my Lord, some ten words long, And tragical, my noble Lord, it is,â For Pyramus therein doth kill himself, Which, when I saw rehears'd, I must confess, Made mine eyes waterâbut more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed. Thes. What are they that do play it? Philos. Hard-handed men, that work in Athens here, Which never labour'd in their minds till now, And now have toil'd their unbreath'd memories, With the same play, against your Grace's nuptials. This is the spot where they rehearse; and, by my faith They're here! (Looking out) and dress'd! all in stage-form and character! Thes. I see; and I will hear this playâ For never anything can come amiss, When simpleness and duty tender it!â Give me my cloak. [Philostrate throws a large Cloak round Theseus.] Unknown, unseen, I'll view them! And let us prove, that what poor duty cannot do, Noble respect takes not in might, but merit. (Theseus and Train retire behind clumps of Trees, where they are partly seen by the Audience, but not by Characters, who enter.) Enter Quince, drest in black, a Paper in his hand, which he holds behind him. Quin. Prologue.ââIf we offendââOne more peep, to mind my stopsâ(looks at Paper)âsoâ clear! âIf we offend, it is with our good willâ That you should think, we come not to offend, But with good will.âTo shew our simple skill, That is the true beginning of our end. Consider then, we come but in despite. We do not come, as minding to content you, Our true intent is. All for your delight, We are not here! thatâ(pauses, and looks at paper), You should here repent you! [Bows, and walks up Stage.] Enter Snout (dressed as Wall.) Wall. In this same Interlude it doth befall, That I, one Snout by name, present a Wall! And this the cranny is (Holding up fingers), right and sinister, Thro' which fond Pyramus and Thisby whisper. Enter Snug (dressed as a Lion), and Starveling with a Lanthorn. Lion. No Lion I, nor eke no lion's dam, But, Ladies, know, I Snug the joiner am! Moon. This lanthorn doth the horned Moon presentâ Myself the Man in the Moonâthat's my intent! Enter Flute, dressed as Thisbe. This. This is the wall, and this the well-known chinkâ Oh Pyramus! (Snout holds up his fingers, and as she is going to peep through them, Lion roars loudlyâThisbe exit hastily, dropping her MantleâWall and Lion retire.) Enter Bottom (dressed as Pyramus.) Pyr. Sweet Moon! I thank thee for thy sunny beams, And for thy gracious, golden, glittering streams. But stay, Oh spight! but mark, poor knight! [Seeing Mantle all bloody.] âWhat dreadful dole is here? Eyes, do you see? Oh lov'd Thisbe! Thy mantle good! thus stain'd with blood! Oh fates! come, come! cut thread and thrumâ Come tears confound! out sword! and wound! Now am I fledânow am I dead! My soul is in the sky!ânow die! die! die! die! (Falls.) (Theseus and Train advanceâBottom not seeing them at first.) Thes. Marry, most notably discharg'd, And that thy efforts may receive reward, Riseâinstant, rise! Bot. Rise!âWhy, Thisbe (half rising) your speech beginsâ âAsleep, my love! what dead, my dove!â (Theseus and all smileâBottom at length sees them, but Theseus still having the long Cloak on, Bottom don't know him.) âHow? Whence? Who? Avaunt, invaders! and don't mar our misrepresentation. [They all laugh.] (Rises.) Without then!âQuince! Starveling! give aid to clear the stage! to turn out (in his rage approaching Theseus, and menacing.) Philos. Beware, and knowâ Bot. I do know!âand fir'd with heroic, tragic ardour, thus my armâ (Seizes Theseus, whose Cloak falls off, and Bottom sees it is the King.) âMercy! the King! dead! dead in earnest! (falls on the Stage at the King's feet.) Thes. Dismiss thy terrors, and look up! Comeâ (Bottom tries to look up, but is frightened, and falls flat again.) To prove we rate not low Our poorest subjects' loyalty and zeal, Follow to the palace. Philostrate, conduct them. See they have cheer and goldâLead on. A fortnight hold we this solemnity, In nightly revels, and new jollity. [Exeunt Theseus and Train, all but Philostrate. Bot. Pheugh! follow to the palace! see, they have cheer and gold! Oh! I knew, if I once got heard as Actor!âLead on, Philos-stÃ te!âAnd this only to a male audience! but when I die before the ladies?âLead on, Philos-stÃ te! A fortnight hold we this solemnity, In nightly revels, and new jollity! [Exit, imitating the King, and follow'd by Philostrate. SCENE II. Another part of the Wood.â(Night.) Enter Puck. Puck. Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down, I am fear'd in field and town, I will lead them up and down. Here comes one combatant, one Athenian lover: I'm glad it did so sort, As this same jangling is to me a sport. Enter Lysander, hastily, his Sword drawn. Lys. Where art thou, proud Demetrius? He goes before me, dares me to the fight! When I come where he calls me, then he's gone! I follow fast, but faster still he runs.â Speak! where art thou, false, false Demetrius? Puck. (Imitating Demetrius) Here, recreant, here! [Exit, unseen by Lysander. Lys. Again! now, traitor! [Rushes off.] Enter Demetrius. Dem. Abide me, false Lysander, if thou dar'st. Puck enters behind. Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place, And dar'st not stand! recreant, speak! Where art thou? Puck. Coward, here! [Exit. Dem. I come, I follow.â(Going offâsuddenly stops.)âYet noâin vainâdarkness, and the wood's uneven paths, to-night must baffle me. So, go thy wayâby day's approach look to be visited again. Meantime, this wood shall be my resting-place, and still, my Hermia, yes, still shall thy Demetrius hope! With fervour hope! SONGâDemetrius.â[Bishop.] Sweet cheering hope, whose magic art Transforms our night to day! Dispel the clouds that wrap my heart, With thy enliv'ning ray! Thus when the sky with baneful steams Has been obscur'd awhile, The sun darts forth his piercing beams, And makes all Nature smile! [Exit. SCENE III. A Wood. Enter Oberon. Ober. Where, where is Robin? blest in love, I would see all its blessings prove! And where these combatants? I fear Still some new error. (Music.) Hark! he's here! Puck (behind.) Puck. I'll apply to thy eye, Gentle lover, remedy. [Music.] (A part of the Wood opensâa Mist is seen âthe Mist gradually disperses, and Lysander is discovered asleep on a flowery Bank, Puck standing by him, with the Herb in his hand.) Puck. When thou wak'st, then thou tak'st True delight, in the sight Of thy former Lady's eye. Hermia shall Lysander meet; Helena Demetrius greet; So shall vanish mutual pain, And each shall have his love again. (Puck squeezes the Juice into Lysander's Eye, and the Wood shuts up again.) Ober. Our work is o'er,âwe've made amends, And here the lovers' contest ends. Come one, come all! And now, till break of day, Through the Duke's palace every Fairy stray; Dance we in Theseus' house triumphantly, And bless it to all fair posterity! AIRâOberon.â[Bishop.] To the best bride-bed will we, Which by us shall blessed be! With this field-dew consecrate, Ev'ry Fairy take his gait. Enter all the Fairies. In Theseus' house give glimmering light, By the dread and drowsy fire, Every Elf and Fairy Sprite, Hop as light as bird from brier. CHORUS. In Theseus' house, &amp;c. [Exit. SCENE IV. Theseus's Grand Hall of AudienceâThrone. [Flourish without.] Enter Theseus, Hippolita, Egeus, and Train. Thes. Yes, my Hippolita; this palpable gross play Has well beguil'd our time.âNext for our pageant, Which, but for thy requestâbut that its fair Director is Hippolita, we willingly ourselves Would not be witness of; since 'tis to celebrate Our own poor triumphs! Hip. Nay, 'tis my pride, my pleasure. Thes. Enoughâit shall proceedâbut first, for thee, Egeus, speakâis not this the day, when Hermia should give answer of her choice? Egeus. It is, my Liegeâand, ah! for her sake, and for mine, 'Pray Heaven she chuse Demetrius for her lord!â He hath my sacred pledge; my honour's bound! Else, Oh, my Sovereign! Nature struggling with duty, I fear, I should indulge a fond, fond father's weakness! Thes. What if Demetrius should resign her hand, And chuse fair Helena? Egeus. In vain; he loves but Hermia, who, till of late, Bore such resemblance to her mother! So watch'dâso nurs'd me! But lo! Demetrius Comes to claim my promiseâ 'Tis wellâand I must claim our stern Athenian law! Enter Demetrius, Lysander, Hermia, and Helena. Thes. So, your decision, Hermia? How! not a word! Speak thou, Demetrius; or thou, Lysander! Or Helena!âall silent! I know, Egeus, they are rival enemies; But hatred seems so far from jealousy! (Turns again to Lysander and Demetrius.) How comes this sudden concord? Lys. My Lord, I shall reply amazedly, Half sleep, half walking. For as yet I cannot truly say from whence it came, But as I think, fair Hermia's, and my own intent Was to begone from Athens, where we might live Without the peril of th' Athenian law. Egeus. Enough, my Liege, you have enough: I beg the law upon Lysander's head. They would have stol'n away, they would, Demetrius; And since a parent's sacred word is pledg'd, Though life should in the contest cease, I claim Your sentence, Sire!âI, her father, claim it. Thes. Demetrius, I insistâ Dem. My Liege, I also shall reply amazedly. For, my good Lord, I wot not by what power, But, by some power it is, my love to Hermia Is melted as the snow; And all the faith, the virtue of my heart, Is only Helena! to her, my Lord, Was I betroth'd, e'er I saw Hermia; But like a sickness did I loath this food, Which, as in health, come to my natural taste, Now I do wish it, love it, long for it, And will for ever more be true to it! (Taking Helena's hand.] Lys. And I, my bond of faith to Hermia Will still maintain, till death shall cancel it. Herm. (Approaching close to Egeus.) Father! what say you? May I love Lysander? (Kneels.) Oh, pardon! pardon! Egeus. My blessings on thee! (Raising and embracing her.) Take her, Lysander; and for thee, Demetrius, The busy phantoms of thy brain dispers'd, May all be happiness and love! (Approaches Theseus.) Hip. How strange, my Theseus, what these lovers speak of! Thes. More strange than trueâI never may believe These antick fables, nor these fairy toys. Lovers, and madmen, have such seething brains, The lunatic, the lover, and the poet, Are of imagination all compact: One sees more devils than vast hell can hold; The madmanâwhile the lover, all as frantic, Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt! The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven! And, as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing A local habitation, and a name!â Such tricks have strong imagination! Fair lovers, you are fortunately met, And in the Temple, by and by, with us, Eternally be joined! (Trumpet without.) Hark! they approach! My hardy veterans! My brave companions in the toil of war!â And since ourselves, we boast not of the pow'r To welcome them in aught, save in the plain Rough language of a soldier, Hermia, stand forth, and with thy dulcet tones, Give, give to all, harmonious greeting. Theseus and Hippolita seat themselves on a Throne.) AIRâHermia.â[Bishop.] Recitative. Warriors! march on! march on, and hear the praise, A grateful Nation to your valour pays! Thrice hail, thou Hero of celestial line! Athenian fame! Athenian freedom's thine! Now Pleasure's voice be heard around! And sweetly lute and lyre resound. Come, welcome song, and playful jest! With chaplets crown each festive guest! Hippolita shall only see, Love, loyalty, and liberty! When shepherds pipe on peaceful plains, He hears, and cheers their native strains, But when the foe assail around, He bids the lofty clarion sound! And arm'd! inspir'd! all Athens sees, Theseus! another Hercules! (A Grand Pageant, commemorative of the Triumphs of Theseus.) CHORUS. His Fame Proclaim! And sound Around Great Theseus' Name!
