      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âA Forest.âTime, Sunset. Jairah, alone. Jai. He comes not!âYet it is almost the hour The westering sun resigns his glorious power. Lo!âslow he sinksâthe gorgeous clouds far-spread, Wear deepening huesâand blushing radiance shed, Those vapoury-lengthening pageantries uncrowned, Shorn of their splendours, shall ere long be found Grey as old Timeâthat ever, as they show In the fair Firmaments their fleeting glow, Triumphs and glories in a finished dayâ One step of his long race and tedious way Completed and fulfilledâand left at last Behind him, with the waxingâlengthening Past!â He comes not!âHark!âMethinks a sound I hear; I'st not some light, faint footstep drawing near? But why this tremour?âthis unwonted start?â Why creeps the blood, slow-curdling round my heart?â This should be guilt!âyet guilt may not be mine, Conscienceâa constant zeal can o'er refine; And so she vergeth on a vain excess!â Through ceaseless exercise of watchfulness! And evermoreâ Mahala enters. Mah. My sireâin search of thee In wandered vainlyâlong and wearily, Some hours agoânot here my way I wonâ And here thou art!âin meditation lone, Addressed to contemplate yon sinking sphere, Whose death's too beauteous to impose a fear, Even on the frailest and least stable mind, So brightly still, 'mid purpling clouds enshrined, And clothed and crowned with glory, rich and deep, His golden harvest doth he parting reapâ Descending, walks his most triumphal way, And Night is heralded by more than Day!â The seasons so conclude their measured round, Even so their close is with fresh glory crowned. The waning year, ere wasted, it expires, Blooms with new fervoursâburns with added fires. 'Tis thus the westering sunâthe wintering year Solemnâscarce sad to mortal eyes appear; Still nature lessons us in love and hope, And bids us ne'er in cheerless langour droop; And, oh! what gratitude of heart and mind, And soul and sense should thrill all human kind! Fatherâbeloved Father!âdid the sound Of our united voices' tones profound, Upraised adoringly in holiest hymn, Not pierce these forest archesâdense and dimâ The massy glooms were sure by th' echoes cleft, Yet of thy presence were we still bereft! It saddened even my thoughtful-breathing prayers, As with a shadowing taint of human cares, To miss thee from thy long-accustomed place, Where thy calm aspect's venerable grace Was wont around a hallowing tone to shed Of earnest truthâas from its fountain-head!â While seemed thy fervent and most flashing eye, Melted and softened with humility!â It looked religion, as it upwards threw Its speaking glancesâthough light clouds and few From time to time obscured it.âAh! my sire! Those darkening cloudsâthat damp its sacred fireâ Frown oftener now, and with a sterner gloom, Sad as the lowering shadows of the tomb! Along thy patriarchal browâ Jai. Forbear! My gentle child!âand let it be thy care Still to be found, at those appointed hours, With offerings meet of earliest fruit and flowers, And guileless heart, as fresh and pure as these, The children of the sun-dew and the breezeâ Pour out that heart in worship's zeal, and pray For him, thine absent sireâfor all awayâ Who may not share in those blest ritesânor show Their trust in Himâthe Lord of all below!â Mah. Father!âforgive thy faithful daughter's love, Thou hast instilled for Him who reigns above, In glory's everlasting light enshrined, Such loveâsuch reverence in my youthful mind, That it must grieve mine inmost heart to see The faintest sign of any change in theeâ That 'tis deep sorrow but to see thee slight The outward observance and the accustomed rite; Though well I feel and know that 'tisâfor us That the evil's wrought, if evil happeneth thus. Too firm, too fixed is thine established soul, Still pressing forward to the eternal goalâ For aught of petty circumstance to shakeâ Or less devoted to its duties make!â But weâmore easily were turned aside From virtue's paths, without our honoured guide, More lightly, tempted, were to rove astray, Nor keep the smooth, straight tenour of our way, If thou didst cherish not each good intent By thine example's dear encouragement! Then, pardon this my too presumptuous zeal; Thou wilt forgive its earnest warmth, I feel. Thou that didst first inspire itâfirst implant, And these, my loving wishes, deign to grant!â Our morning and our evening rites attend, And still with ours thy supplications blend. Then, oh!âwhat joy 'twill prove, once more to see Thee, our loved father, midst thy family!â What joy, from thine own honoured voice to hear Those cherished precepts thus made doubly dear!â So wilt thou for thy kinsmen'sâchildren's sakeâ One midst our solemn congregations make!â Though thine own soul, in free and fearless flight, Long since soared up to worship's holiest height! Long since, upspringing from earth's dust and clay, Exulting reached the loftiest realms of day. Nor thence descendedâbut transfixed remained On those bright summits it had well attained; Scarce cast one thought beneath, one look behind, Of Heaven all-seeingâbut to earth grown blind! Though moving yet midst mortal things, and made To wear that fleshly form man's sins degradeâ 'Tis for our sakes that thou ev'n now wilt deign To stoop awhile to mount as high again!â To stoopâto teach us like thyself to rise, And marshal our bright passage to the skies! Jai. My daughter!âmy sweet daughter!âbe it thine To walk in holiness and peaceâ'tis mine To wander mid abstruser contemplation Than thou couldst fathomâthine imagination Is peopled with the beautiful and bright, And revels in one luxury of glad light. All nature's beauty shines reflected thereâ Be bless'd and blessing thouâ'tis mine to bearâ Mah. Ah! father! fair is Natureâpure and grandâ The work is worthy of the Almighty hand; (Worthy of the Creator's power supreme, Still all His works and all their wonders seem;) And when, transparent as her heavens by night, That show ten thousand worlds of conquering light, The shadow of His Godhead she appears, 'Tis then an aspect more august she wears! The light of His dread countenance on hers Seems brightly cast, and endless pomp confers!â Is't not beneath the touch of mightiest prayer That mystic consciousnesses fill the air?â Then doth the Beautiful at once become A thousand-fold more fair, with heaven-born bloomâ Then nature takes her nobler formâwe feel 'Tis then she doth her awful truths revealâ Her mystical transparency to those Whose spirit with the Eternal Presence glows! Well may they bless herâthey may well bow down, And worship Her great Maker and their Own!â They veil the sun with one more dazzling Thought, To Him upturned who that bright wonder wrought! And when his light is lost another lives, That many a world unknown to vision gives! Oh! let us haste to fall before Him nowâ Alas!âthat look austereâthat angered browâ What have I said to cause that altered mien? That front for me hath ever shown serene!â Jai. Enough! my childâI bid thee hence,âbegone!â Fain would I pass some thoughtful hours aloneâ On these deep subjects touch thou not again. It is thy praises that have given me pain! Wherefore, I know not wellâyet it is soâ Old thoughts rise upâdismissed long, long ago.â Leave me, I pray theeâI reproach thee notâ But hence!âI charge thee, haste and quit this spot. Mah. I go, obedient to thy high command;â But, ere I go, would kiss thine honoured hand, And hear thee speak one kind consoling word, And my presumption's pardon thus accord!â Saidst thou thou chid'st me not?âupon mine ear Fall no harsh accents from those lips so dear;â But heavy fall upon my watchful heart Thine anger's saddening tokens!âI depart!â Jai. Yet stay a moment's space, my daughter!âstay! Bear hence my blessing!âNo!ânot so!âaway!â But I do bless theeâthough between us roll Worlds wide and waste,âgulphs yawn 'twixt soul and soul:â Though man and fiend forbidâthough death and fate, And ruin interpose,âand sin and hate,â I yet will bless thee!ânor my words recallâ Yea! I will bless theeâand defy them all: For thy sweet sake Heaven's peace shall be my guest, Yea!âI will bless theeâand thou shalt be blest! Mah. I tremble!âfor thy words grow dark and wild; Calm theeâcompose thy thoughtsâfor me, thy child! Thine eye is flashing with terrific fire, Thy lip convulsed, and curled with desperate ireâ Blackened thy front with some portentous cloudâ Oh! call for help on pitying Heaven, aloud.â Jai. Away!âdepart from me, my daughterâceaseâ And leave me now to solitude and peace. No more!âbegone!ânor longer here delay, Thank my forbearance, and at once obey! [Exit Mahala. (Alone.) A weight is off my heart, now she is gone! I love, and yet I dread to be alone! Still will I long these forest-depths explore, While sterner shadows chequer earth's dim floor; Mid close recesses of tremendous gloom, Where human footsteps shall not dare to come; But they shall visit meâyea! here awhile, Will I await them, and my doubts beguile.â (A pause,) They come notânor that Being, more than all, Who seems yet more than Being!âat whose call I almost deem the universe would quakeâ Through its vast realmsâyet shall my soul not shake, Through its more boundless nature!âproudly, no! Before One Being only 'twould do so!â TheeâMajesty of majesties!âeven Thee!â For Thou alone should'st its prostration seeâ Thou only view its faultering courage fail, Thou only bid this daring spirit quail! Thou knowst, whate'er I claimâwhate'er I crave, Thy wrath I dare not brook, Thy judgments braveâ But seek to reconcile to Thy high will That fate I feel commissioned to fulfil. Is my design not good?âmy purpose kind? Why with misgivings shrinks my anxious mind?â Away with these vain thoughts! if these intrude, Too weak and wavering grows my changeful mood. Be thou, my dubious soul, of better cheer: They come notâI must bid them to appear!â For through a new-accorded power, 'tis mine To breathe a deeper spellâto make such sign As must the most unruly teach to bow, And own themselves the masteredânow, e'en now!â Why do I hesitate?âfull oft before Have I used spells, and charms of mystic lore: Yet ne'er of such supreme, such dreadful mightâ To think it o'er e'en chills me with affright! Worlds from their parent systems might be torn, Checked on their path the coming times, unborn; All the elements from rule and order driven, Were that dread spell pronouncedâthat signal given, In its full tyranny unproved,âunknownâ Part of its powers will I awake alone!â Now but call forth a portion to mine aid; Then let me face these terrors undismayed: E'en thus I hesitate!âwhat is't I fear?â No matter!âit must be!âthe hour draws near! (He mutters an incantation.) They come! my conscious soul their presence owns, As ocean doth the storms!âwhen low it moans, Breathless with its intense expectancy, Now sinking and now swellingâmust it be? It must!âand doubt and frozen dread are vain, They come, and o'er my prostrate being reign!â Spirits of mystery!âye are round me now, Spirits whose breath seems withering up my brow! All unbeholdenâunimagined all!â That yet obey my spell's prevailing thrall! Oh! take the medium of a mortal voice, That thus my soul may listen and rejoice!â (A voice is heard.) A voice of many voices!âlo!âa sound That troubles all the awakening air around, That undistinguishably uttered, thrills My soul with consternation,âawes and chills!â No peace my long-conflicting feelings find; Strange harrowing doubts distract my restless mind; Spirits unseen, now hovering round me here, I ask ye notânor wish ye to appear. This grace unto my watchful zeal allow, Link mortal voice with mortal language now, This sound doth torture meâhush!âhark!âit takes A language and a meaning, and so breaks The oppressive tension of my senses: lo! Like sounds of many waters doth it flow! Voice. Mortal!âthy wish discloseâthy will unfoldâ We listen!âfrom the mountains hoar and old, From the ocean, in monarchic purple robedâ The central mines that never have been probed; The starry etherâand the unbounded space! We come, we comeâto one of clay's lost race! From theseâand more than theseâwe comeâwe come,â Each from our Undiscoverable Home; From the Uncommunicativeness of Mystery, Since ne'er shall earth's frail archives hold our history! From the unimagined depths of our lone peaceâ Dare mortals' spells bid that bright calm to cease? We come, we comeâdisclose thy will to usâ Who speed to serve thee, and obey theeâthus! The spirits of all the elements are we, The dwellers of the unmoved eternity: To thee and to thy mandate's thrall we bow, We listen and await!âcommand us thou! Declare at once thy need and thy desireâ Then swift release us!âhasteâand sayâretire! Jai. Knowledge! full knowledge!âbow ye to my spell, And sweep away the Incomprehensible From mine impatient thoughtâaccord a sign By which I mine at once perceiveâdivineâ And penetrate the unfathomed and the obscure: Grant thisâye mightiest beings!âproud and pure! Grant thisâand all my soul for evermore Shall deep thanksgivings yield, free praises pour! Voice. First unto us must thou, e'en thou, reveal, Thine aimâthy purposeânor in aught conceal: First unreservedly to us impart The hidden wiles and workings of thy heart; Thy will must thou declareâthy wish disclose; And moreâthe secret of thy soul expose: The height and depth of thine aspiring dream, And all the springs the shapings of thy scheme. Do this, and we will serve thee, and obey; Do thisâand it is done!âbut speak and say! Jai. How!âbare to ye the depths of my design!â Ye have your mysteries, Spirits!âI have mine! Unquestioningly obey meâor depart; Consent and cavil notâor crush my heart And wound my spirit with your harsh denial, 'Twill be the o'erflowing of wrath's burning vial. Consentâand unconditionally too, Or hence!âavaunt!âtill ye are called anewâ Since even with strength increasedâand added might, Will I compel ye yetâand claim my right; Unmurmuringly my mandate's power confess, Nor strive my secret quest to glimpse or guess: Pause not, nor shrinkâfulfil my fixed desire, At once obey meâor at once retire!â Retireâif contumacious and perverse, You brave my anger, and call down my curseâ But so, ye disputatious spiritsâdread His wrath who calls ye subjects!âI have said! Voice. The spirits of the elements are we, The dwellers in the unchanged eternity; The mighty spirit of the air awaits Thine uttered phantasies, to make them fates!â Thy spoken wishesâsyllabled desiresâ To crown and grant them ere the hour expires! The hurricane he hurled from out his hand, Nought heeding but thy high and strong command! He hastened to obey thy word and beck, For thine is power we may not chain nor check; Wrung from unutterable, unknown probations, And carried through all Systems and Creations: He hurried to do homage e'en to thee; Fettered to earth in frail humanityâ The loosened hurricane went howling on, Till all that met its madness were undone! It sped, and scattered terror wide and far. A sweeping Ruinâand a flying War!â Ten thousand thrones of triumph he had piled, Of clouds in yonder azure ocean isled; But these he leftâleft all, to greet thee hereâ The Ruler of the boundless Air is near!â The glorious Spirit of the all-searching Fire Attends to do thy bidding and desire!â He cometh to be made thy minister, And mightiest gifts and dread can be confer, Touching the unconscious earth with flaming feet, Doth he the mortal and the magian greet! His steps scorch notânor scar the dewy ground, Since veiled he moves in shadowy guise profound! Where the volcanoes pour their boiling streams He builds his couch, and basks in lurid beams; Where midst stunned worlds the crackling comets fly, He breathesâand burns defiance through the sky! Stern task had he of late, and mission direâ Heâthe awful Spirit of the all-searching fire!â Lo!âhe was bade to blight, and to destroy, A world that once rolled free in flashing joy!â Scattering the illuminations of its pride Gladly around, unchecked, on every side!â Then did he haste to spread his glittering wings, And bore destruction 'mid its glorious things; There did he gird himself with strength and state, There, crowned with conflagrations, beamed elate! His was stern triumph, none might hope to check; His car of victory was a world's fall'n wreck! Forth from his nostrils smoked the breath of wrath, And desolations blackened round his path; But from that maddening festival of flame, To do thy bidding and behestâhe came; The tyranny of thy dark spell o'ertook, The conqueror 'mid his mightâhis rent throne shook! Amazement glared along the ruined scene, Where ashes smokedâwhere once a world had been! The Fire King hastened from his triumphs then, And waits thy wordâthou terrible of men! The Spirit of the Waters is at hand, Called by the potent voice of thy command! Vast are his liquid kingdomsâwithout end, Through the unimagined regions these extend! The waters hung above the firmament, Shrink at his signâor at his voice find vent; The waters that in countless currents flow Beneath the firmaments, his mastery know; The fountains of the Deep his will obey, Acknowledging the fulness of his sway; The billows are the chariots of his state, The cataracts are his trumpets!âblown elate! Their long-resounding tones with deep'ning swell, Upon the shuddering sense o'erpow'ring dwellâ The water-columns of the sea appear The pillars of his blue pavilion clear! His foamy banners he, ere long, shall raise, Through the hours portentous of disastrous days, Mighty his ministration shall be made, His march of ruin shall no more be stayed; The earth shall launch her lightnings at the skies; Lightnings of flashing surges, thence shall riseâ And she shall groan in thundersâhark! what sound Muttered in mustering strengthâfrom the profound?â Look! 'tis another worldâa howling waste, A barrennessâ'mid happier spheres misplaced; Weep for the fallenâthe founderedâfatedâweep; Life's glorious riotâquenched in death's cold sleep; Weep for the myriadsâruined and destroyed, Their works all vanishedâand their world a void; Their strong-holds vanquished, and their sunshine veiled, Their towers, their mountains, ev'n by the ocean scaled! Earth grows their sepulchre, dark doom and dread, For she herself lies low ensepulchred, In the fierce swallowing tides, and from the spheres Is blottedâtill the universe is tears!â Weep not!âenough of weeping shall there be, Earth's furrowed face is blistered by the sea, Whose sharp, salt sources shall be poured and poured, Till Chaos for awhile shall seem restored, Since fragments of crushed rocks shall drift along, Those boiling surges in their triumph strongâ And meteor-flashes of the appeaseless ire, Shall chafe their surface with the unmingling fireâ While hissing horribly towards heaven's sole shore, The annihilating waves exulting roarâ And savage windsâtheir trumpets blow through all!â Not from the grave, but to the grave to call! Loud as the archangel's summons that shall sound, When judgment comethâand the judge is crowned, He unto Chaos calledâit understood!â Creation answered Himâand it was good!â Now to creation cries he âDisappear!â Chaos makes answer, tremblingââI am here!â Oh, men!âye doomed ones! whither shall ye fly? The stars shrink from ye farther in the sky; Your very prayers, that speak your shuddering dread, Rain back in mocking ruin on your head. Even could ye climb the loftiest mountain's steep, Ye might not scape the inexorable Deepâ For that should follow with its deafening howl, With thunder of fierce shouts, and laughter foul; And carry fearlessly its foaming war, Up the Height's pointed Perpendicularâ Nor thence in headlong cataracts swift descend, But raise its front on high, with heaven to blend; That lurid heavenâdark lowering to a hell, Where but the fiends of wrath shall seem to dwell. So of Creation shall be Chaos made, And Hell of Heaven!âare men yet undismayed? Of boundless Life one universal Death,â Of Day one Midnight palled in doom beneath! Of coming vengeance is not earth apprized? Are portents stern and prophecies despised: They will not heed, till roars the raging sea Their sentence to their souls unpityingly! Till Death no longer doth on Time await, Who singly calls frail mortals to their fate;â But gorged with life's uncounted millions all, Holds hideous holiday and festival. The deadly shark goes rioting in joy, And surges huge, the scaly host upbuoyâ The dragon, like earth's demon, from his den, Creeps wonderingâand the dolphin revels then;â Where bounded free the panther in his pride, But they e'en perish in the o'ertroubled tide! Leviathan goes lashing on his way, Till he too sinksâthe whirling waters' prey!â In whose unwholesome rage and fury armed, Nought living can remainânought rest unharmed; Save those aloneâthe singled forthâthe saved; Those, not by fears defiled nor sins enslaved, The cherished ones and chosen!âwho shall float O'er that dire swell, from danger's grasp remote, Enshrined in peace and safety in their ark, The mortal-buildedâbut heaven-beaconed bark! Stamped on Seth's seed this first salvation's seal: More dare we not pronounceânor more reveal. The Water Spirit waiteth for thy word, He by whose will the ocean-depths are stirred; To yeasty trouble, and o'erpowering strife, To harrowing mockery of most tortured life! And, lo!âthe sorrowing Spirit of the Earthâ Bows to thy bidding nowâwho watched thy birth; Consents unto thy thrall and thy command, Thy power confessesânor may dare withstand: These spirits hang upon thy breath and beck. A charm is thine whose power they dare not check; These spirits wait and watch, intent to learn Thy purposeâand thy hidden soul discern; And moreâyet unimaginably moreâ Spirits whose sway is not of sea or shoreâ Of air or fireâor aught that may belong To this Creation, own thy mastery strong! Spirits of elements to thee unknown, Unclassedâuncountedâne'er to mortals shownâ Those which the eye of soul ne'er wandered o'erâ Moreâmoreâyet unimaginably more!â Speak then, oh, mighty! ask what boon thou wilt; But if not goodâon thee shall rest the guilt. Speakâand ordainâbut first must thou disclose Thy secret purpose, and thy aim expose! Jai. I tell ye, never!âtill that aim is made Atchievement's fulness! hence! withdraw your aidâ Refuse your counselsâand reject my prayersâ I yet will hunt ye to your hidden lairsâ Yet force ye to comply, and make ye bow Before the master that ye mock e'en now; With strength diminished, and with power curtailed, That spell I spoke, in mystery's dimness veiledâ But ye shall hear it!âand acknowledge yet The rule ye seem well-minded to forget!â Not here that charm's tremendous influence ends, Serve him as slaves whom ye forsake as friends; No guests, but vassals shall ye henceforth prove, And crouch in fearâthat would not cede in love!â Hence!âwith your darkling hints and shrouded words, To sound their depth no time my task affords. I scorn your muttered prophecies and threatsâ And mock ye!âmockers!âhence!âif th' earth's sun sets, 'Twill in no deluge be, save one of blood, When man is roused, and his fiend-foes withstood! Ye vaunt it bravely!âbut it matters notâ Ye yet shall yieldâand on this self-same spot!â Here shall ye yield to him ye here defy; Back to your earthâyour elementsâyour sky!â Your whispering vain denouncements move not me, I cannot pause, and fear nor theseânor ye!â The future may seem full of heavy fateâ He who appoints may yet his wrath abate! He who alone can fixâmay yet see fitâ That wrath to man in mercy to remit!â I tremble not!âfor nought that is without Can shake me with one pang of dread or doubt; I tremble but when that which prompts within, Points to some evil thought or deed of sin!â And yetâno moreâbegone, dark beings! now, I ask no answerâand will none allow!â The hour draws near when ye shall feel my ire, Meantimeâno moreâreply not, but retire!â [A rushing noise is heard. (A pause.) Now will I seek, ere morning's rosy smile, The calm refreshments of repose awhile [Exit. SCENE II. ADRAMELECH AND MAHALA. Adr. Long hours and dark have passed since we have met, I sought thee notâyet did I not forgetâ But vigils stern,âordeals dread and deep, Have mine been,âthrough long nights denied to sleep, And strange observances and mystic cares, Whose troublous strife, the watchful spirit wearsâ 'Twas since to these dark tasks I did incline, I shunned that more than heavenly brow of thine: I would not have thee share the griefâthe gloom, But snatch with me life's brightness and its bloom!â Mah. Thou didst and dost me wrong!âfor me those hours Flowed heavily, in my forsaken bowers!â How heavily I may not strive to tellâ All of love's truth is the undescribableâ Still sorrowing o'er thine absence, time for me Seemed yawning to a blank eternity! And dars't thou sayâthou dost not thinkâmy heart Could e'er know rest, or peace from thine apart?â Think'st thou my soul a single pang to spare, By not permitting it thy pains to share. Ah! no! with sympathy of sufferance still, 'Twould answering feelânay! aggravate each ill!â Thou darest not dream that I would shrink from aught That thou endurestâshame be on the thought! I will not abdicate love's holiest rightâ To share as well the sorrow as delight; Nor be thus dispossessed of all I prize On earth the most, the power to soothe thy sighs, To charm thy cares to stillness, or divideâ In joy or misery, still with thee allied! Adr. Mine own beloved! and wilt thou share with me, I know not what of dread and agony?â Wilt thou not shrink when perils press between? Wilt take thy leave of earth's familiar scene? Affront ten thousand dangers thickening round, And dwell with threatening glooms mysterious bound? Wilt thou, mine own beloved, dare these and more? For awful destinies must be in store For meâAh! pardonâsweet!âfor usâI feel!â More than these lipsâthan language can reveal. Wilt thou indeed?âwilt share my rise or fallâ Wilt share my perilsâmy probations? Mah. All! Adr. Wilt thou forget all known and natural ties, And turn from earth and heaven thy 'wildered eyes? Wilt bow with me to some tremendous thrall, And cope with things thought dare not graspâ Mah. All! All! Adr. Nayâhear me!âmark, and weigh, and ponder well, Whilst I the truth, in all its terrors, tell!â Wilt thou with me dread penalties incurâ Brave fierce contention's agonizing stirâ Wilt thou indeed partake my deadliest doomâ And plunge with me in its abyss of gloom?â Mah. Would I could more than suffer it, and share it! Would that for thee ev'n I alone might bear it! Oh! 'twere worse pain, worse anguish to partake, Than sole to suffer it for thy dear sake. For thee would I all agonies affrontâ All dangers brookâall stern disasters brunt. For thee would face all the evils of creationâ For theeânot with theeâdareâannihilation!â No!ânot with theeâthou glory and thou pride Of the earthly race with which thou walk'st allied! Adr. I do and must believe theeâand no more Will brave alone what I have borne before. Rise up into thy Rights!âfor thou say'st well, Love claims through all things with the loved to dwell! Thou shalt ere long thine arduous task commenceâ Receive my soul's unclouded confidence!â The fullest trust that I can giveâreceive; And as I grant thee credenceâme believe. Enter with me on this most solemn pact; Be ours deep unity of aim and actâ Of planâof purportâthought and trust and deed. Yea!â'tis to beâ'tis doneâand 'tis decreed!â Yet hold!âstill pause one momentâyet a wordâ Those tears speak volumes!âbut I must be heard!â Thou may'st not know and shouldst not know, mine own!â (For of some thoughts and things thou still hast shown, Even childhood's innocence!âand thou art pure As morning's dewsâso may'st thou long endure!) How passions can reign strong in man's wild heartâ From holy gracious tendernessâapart!â Alas! it is too muchâand must I show To thee these depths of wildness and of woe? I mustâdown, downâstung heart!âpeace, madd'ning brain! Dark tale!âthou must be told!âthis pause is vain!â I must lay bare my blighted soul to thee, Ere that our compact be completedâsee!â The strong man weakenedâto the dust e'en bowed!â The brave man daunted, and abased the proudâ The bold abashedâthe reckless one dismayedâ As if in full career o'erta'en and stayed!â Never till nowâNo!ânever, till this hour Before, or strength, or pride, or wealth, or power, Trembled my soul to utter or avow Aught unto any!âHide thy glorious brow, Too terrible in beauty, while I speak! Oh! turn away that sun-envermeilled cheek! I may not dare behold its blush of fireâ At that I must revealâand still respire! Now let me straight proceed upon my tale, And unto thine unlooked-on eyes unveil The haunting horrors of my soul!âAttend!â Mah. I do!âPronounce!âwhile soul in soul we blendâ But fear notâdream not aught that thou canst say Can scare one sweet throb of my love awayâ One dreaming of my strong devotionâno! Sinâmadnessâruinâdeathâshould ne'er do so!â No! though black crimes have steeped and stained thy soul, Love's sacred breath shall purify the whole!â For where love smiles can sin be left behind!â The seraph still must exorcise the fiend! Thineâthine I am, through all things, thine alone; Through crowned affection's mightiest charmâthine own. Ah! would I might be more of thineâyet moreâ For this distinct existence I abhor!â Divideless souls, and yet a separate stateâ Distracted elementsâthough blended fateâ I would but have thy life, thy pulse, thy willâ Think through thy thoughtsâbut breathe through thy breath still! Would I were more than thine!âwould I might be Absorbedâannihilated intoâthee!â Adr. Mine own Mahala!âyet I pray theeâcease!â Not these sweet words can witch me back to peace! The stern task lies before me!âI must strive To lend my pangs a languageâand yet live!â I love thee!âthou know'st notânor I how much. Or in its fulness would I now avouch This adoration's uttermost excess!â This fond and fathomless devotednessâ My life!âI love theeâbut thou'rt not the firstâ [Mahala faints. Distraction!âShe is goneâand Iâaccursed!â 'Tis I have held the poison to her lipsâ Brought on her head this lastâworstâdread eclipse. There lies sheâreft from feeling and from breath, All heaven, and earth, and nature now are deathâ Softly!âhad I forgot my wonderous spellâ A whisper and a signalâall is well!â Mahala! come to my wrung soul once more; Thus let its life be trebledâto adore!â Speak!âcans't thou ne'er forgive me that I loved Ere bright perfection lived and breathed and moved Before me, in that form which grew my fate?â True! some soft instinct should have bid me waitâ Some mystic sympathyâsome strange, sweet tieâ Till thou before me beamed thus matchlessly!â Yet pardon meâthat wandering lone and far, Ere my sun rose, I hailed a herald star!â 'Twas but a first soft lesson in love's art Whose heavenly lore enlightens now my heartâ An introduction sweetâand faint insightâ To love's blest tome (that book of life and light.) Thus pardon me!âand hear me now proceed To speak those words, that make my heart-veins bleedâ Those words that haply yet may cost me allâ Which prompts us still to bless life's stubborn thrall!â Oh! 'tis humiliation's triumph thus To breathe to thee, in accents tremulous, The hated history of my deeds of oldâ That record which till now was ne'er unrolled!â And pour confessions, in thine ear averse, Of crimesâtheir condemnationâand their curse! To bear this bruised heart's heavy chroniclings Of dark and desperate, and of deadly things! My crimes?âAye! worseâmy weaknesses!âfor still I stand the unfaultering champion of my will. But hear and judge!âAnd oh! in mercy deign To pardon allâyet pity not my pain. Not pity!âno!âtoo much like love is this, And that is still too much of maddening blissâ The wretch who stands before theeâmust not now, While tasked a truth so fearful to avow, Receive of sympathy's indulgence aught. No! worse distraction darkens from that thought!â Pronounce my pardon!âbut with stifled breath And stern, averted aspectâcold as death!â Mah. My heart pronounces it!âthou know'st of old, If that to thee can be or stern or cold! Adr. (not heeding her.) Oh! my lost ZophiÃ«l! thou, creation's flower, But doomed to blush and bloom for one brief hour, How should I paint thee?âOnce Thou, more than dear! Give moonbeams for my pencils, calm and clear. Oh! no!âtoo cold!âand colours there are none To show how thy young dewy day-spring shoneâ I cannot paint thy likeness!ânot unless A soul like thine, all lucid loveliness, Could be o'er-pictured with that portraiture, Thouâbut for meâdespite meâstill so pureâ Which beauty-breathing thoughts should blazon thereâ Then 'twould mistaken beâtoo heavenly fairâ For something of etherial race and birth, And lift the spirit that it stampedâfrom earth!â Thus e'en thine Image could not bide below, But, like thyself, from this dull planet go. I cannot paint thy likeness!âthou didst seem Too delicate for truthâtoo dear for dream! Through that transparent tenderness and grace,â That effluence of the eternal lightâthy faceâ 'Twas love himselfâthere softly smiling shoneâ Thy soulâand formâand faceâand love were one! He lighted all thy lovelinessâthat lit His radiance moreâand did his beams transmit! Till earth was made, as 'twere, his sun serene, His and thy presence so illumed her scene; All the elements emparadising so, That midway raised to heaven she seemed to glow. Mah. Thy spirit wandereth to the lost one's grave; Collect thy thoughtsâalas!âthou dost but rave! Adr. I thank thee, that hast brought me back to life!â The dark soul-murder of its daily strifeâ The wreckâthe desolation and the blightâ This piercing painfulness of loveless lightâ Allâall this loathsomeness of miseryâ Back to myselfâto madnessâandâ Mah. To me!â Ah! when to thee had it before seemed woe, To quit even heavenâto find me still below? Return unto my soul!âwhate'er this griefâ Let the exercise of patience bring relief, But most the deep devotion, yet untried, That would be proudâfor thee but to have died; Yet that devotion scarce I dare intrude On the dark sternness of thy solemn mood!â Stillâmight she soothe who doubly feels thy painâ Ah! but forgive meâspeak of her again; Call all thy sorrowing memories round thee now, I will at least with hard-learned patience bow; To thy stern mandate silently submit, Nor breathe of pityâthough I pine for it! Endure to see thy much-loved bosom bleed, Nor show that pity I myself most need! Adr. Oh!âshe was beauteous!âand her smiles and tears Were e'en like those of infancy's sweet yearsâ Sudden and softâyet full of soul no less, And worlds of melancholy tenderness; For e'en her smiles were sorrow-touched, as though Her prophet-heart anticipated woe!â Her form was fragile as those phantasies That flit before the poet's haunted eyesâ Not compassed round with glorious majestyâ To strikeâto aweâand to command, like thee! Not like to thine her mienâmy promised bride!â Whose regal port speak passion's might and pride!â Whose aspect shows so awful though sereneâ And stamps thee where thou stand'stâCreation's Queen! No!âhers was meek and shrinking and subduedâ As though to pass unmarkedâunsoughtâshe suedâ Girt round with innocency's holiest charm, And gentleness a whisper might alarm! Shrouded in hushed submissiveness, that lent New witchery to her drooping languishment And, oh! the imploring eloquence of eyes, Dewy and blue as spring's delicious skies; But their beseeching glances prayed in vain, These might not so avert the blightâthe stainâ The wrath, the ruin by the furies fed,â Destined to fall on that too helpless headâ And talked I not of innocency's charm?â That too availed not to protect from harmâ The foulest, fellest e'er by fiends devised, To snatch to fate the unwary soul surprisedâ No! nought availed!âMild Mercy smiled not near, And Love was lost in wrath and hate and fear. Mah. Yet pause awhileâthy troublous tale seems fraught With torments of excruciating thought!â Adr. Pause?âpause?âI checked not then my murtherous course, But headlong rushedâthen paused not in remorseâ Not for the pleading of soft pity stayedâ Nor for one hour the undying deed delayedâ Mah. Speak thou once more of the unknown lost one's grace, Her harmony of form and heaven of face!â Oh! let me strive to learn her looksâand live, So like the Dead, thou mayst thyself forgive, And deem she still is clasped unto thy soul, For thee to bless and succour and console. (Aside.) Fain would I thus beguile him to forget That task, so trying, he attemptsâself-set! Adr. Veiled in a cloud of blushes, still she came, As doth the morning star, in light and flame. Not that herself, in sooth, had aught to hide; 'Twas the base world those cheeks of beauty dyed With the eloquence of rich suffusions so; Mantled for us that mediatorial glow. And how she loved me!âwords were worse than weak, That love's unfathomable depths to speak! For her still seemedâwhile lingering here beneathâ Law on my lipâand being from my breathâ My shadow was the very sun to her; But in my presence seem'd her pulse to stirâ But at mine accents, consciousness awoke, Her soul was still suspendedâtill I spoke!â Then grew my words her meaning!âand my will The very destiny that ruled her still!â The destiny she blest, although 'twas deathâ And worseâshe loved perdition from my breath; And nobly I that tenderness repaid, And generous was the accursed return I made; A lofty answer and a worthy found, That trembling lowliness of love profound!â Affection's sweet sublimities how well I shared and feltânor faulteredâthough she fell!â Heaven was to her that spot whereon I stood, My evil was for her the only good!â Mah. Say on!âand tell meâteach me how I love; For all thou say'st 'tis I have proved and prove; And more!âsince I have climbed the dizziest height And pinnacle of pride, with dark delight, To fling myself from thence at thy loved feet, And find the abasement of my soul more sweet! Lo!âI yet boast of prideâthus bowed to thee; For I am proud of my humility!â I glory in that lowliness of love, With which so richly burthened I too move! Shame on the soul which were not proud to fall, And yield to love its powers and treasuresâall. Shame on thy loved one's shadeâif she forgot To triumph thusâif thus she gloried not!â Give me no throneâmy soul's own voice hath saidâ Save in the dust thou tramplest with thy tread! Give me no worldsâor earthly or divine, Save 'twere to spurn them for one smile of thine;â I, who once asked an angel's mounting wing, Grow, at thy beck, a downcast drooping thing! And am I proud! yea! gloriously I ownâ But of this slavery unto thee alone!â To bend, for thy dear sake, and by thy side, Crowns all my heart's ambition and its pride! Adr. Dare not to speak 'gainst her one darkling wordâ Who but too madly lovedâtoo much adored;â If she was silentâoh! her spirit spoke; The avowal from her actsânot accents, brokeâ She weighed not, watched not what those feelings were That love to fill all earth's quick hearts might spare! Still more than allâimmeasurably more, To unapproachable excessâadore!â No skill of tongue was hersâno strife of thought; Love was her elementâall else was nought! Love was her whole existence!âessenceâendâ Nor sought she eloquence to truth to lend; To me her feelings flowedâher thoughts to me, Affection grew life's sweet necessity! Back on themselves these thoughts were never turned, To teach the mysteries they unconscious learned; I knew the councils of her curtained breast, The secrets of her shrouded soulâthe best!â She paused notâpondered notâfrom their first birth Those young emotions like to dovesâcame forthâ To brood but in my bosomâthere to bideâ Still termed in mineârolled all her being's tide! No labour was her loveâher only skillâ Was breathless full submission of her will! Entire devotednessâunbounded zealâ Whose keen intensenessâscarce she knew to feelâ Nay! speak notâlest I own to thy pained earâ Her silence,âthan thine eloquence more dear!â Mah. Avow it!âI will yet play such a part As even must fix thy long-divided heartâ And thenâyet no!âtill that proud part I play, I lock my lipsâ'tis thou that shalt unsay!â And spare thyself!âthou needst not more unfold:â Unto my listening heartâthe tale is told!â Words vexed and broken, can full much expressâ To sentient feeling's wakeful watchfulness!â There needs but this,âwhen frowned that fated deed, Betwixt thy soul and heaven?âbreak, Hope! thy reed! I see that heaven, snatched farther from mine eyes, I feel thy fault hurls bothâfrom yon veiled skies, Both bansâboth banishesâfor well thou know'st Thy fate is mineâmy soul goes where thou goest! And must demand like ruin and like wreck, And all thy doomâadored Adramelech! And wherefore was that deed of darkness wrought? Thus much discloseâthen shut the seal on thought! Adr. Nay! ask not how, or where, or why, or when, That deed was wrought which stamps meâworst of men! SufficeâI bowed to fiend's infernal lawsâ Devoting thusâthe cherished toâthe cause!â Enquire not fartherâlet thus much sufficeâ The sinless fellâthe sinner's sacrifice! Sinless in all things, save in loving one, Who led, lured, lessoned herâto be undone. Yet all unconsciouslyâunwitting allâ She totteredâtrembled onwards to her fall!â She faced for me the torture and the tombâ The depths of undiscoverable doom!â But dreamed not all that lay concealed behind, The worse than woe to which she was consigned, All the everlastingness of ruin broughtâ On her, beyond the tracery of man's thoughtâ No common destinyâno foretold curseâ A doom from whence chill'd fancy shrinks averse! And I have called herâbut she never came!â Through nights of sleepless woe have breathed that name, Whose echo seems an earthquake's crash and peals, As judgment thunders loudâtill Reason reels!â Seest thou the gory spot, this front that stains, A brand of blood far deeper seared than Cain's!â Hell's fires are burnt into my brain through this, And my scorched heart the undying victim 'tis!â Mah. No more!âI charge thee speak no farther wordâ My heart in truth hath too distinctly heard, Like waters troubled by an angry sky, Its depths reflect thine every agony!â Lo!ânow hear me and mine!âErewhile didst thou Speak of sworn compact;âratify it now!â Now be thy love no more by doubt chastised, The Marriage of our Souls be solemnized!â Would'st have my spirit with thine own unite? So be it!âthus and here receive my plight! My choiceâmy deep election, now are madeâ Call thou my soul's roused energies to aid! Thou askedst me to weighâmarkâchooseâI doâ And most deliberately and deeply too!â With thee in hope, and heart, and hand I join, Thy paths, thy plansâthine aims and acts be mine! But firstâresolve me!âsaidst thou thou hadst prayed, And vainly to thy ZÃ¶phiel's silent shade?â Doth she resist thy callâreject thy claim? And hast thou cried to herâwho never came? Adr. (looking upwards,) I have implored, besought theeâday and nightâ Adjured with agonizing passion's mightâ I haveâmy ZÃ¶phielâmurderedâmartyredâthou!â Who teachest him who never bentâto bowâ And I, the unshrinking oneâthe haughty-souledâ Blind in the dust have gasping, grovelling rolled,â And groaned forth supplications that might wring The past from its oblivion's witheringâ Vainlyâall vainly!âthou hast answered notâ Unheeded the despairâthe love forgot,â And I have moaned in misery's abject mood, My shuddering invocationsâmockedâwithstood,â Withstood and mocked for ever!âall in vain!â A rain of blood comes sapping heart and brain; And a live darkness folds me as a snakeâ In venomed graspâtill my swoln pulses ache; And I have said! come forth!âfrom death's dread gloom, What though to crush,âcondemnâconsume meâcome! Not to enlighten these so phrenzied eyes, To blastâannihilateâappear!âarise!â Mah. Yet tell me, oh, beloved!âart not thou lord Of mightiest spells?âbut speak the lightning wordâ Pronounce the fearfulâ Adr. Hush!âno more! no more! I sought her, and besought her o'er and o'er; Imploredâurgedâprayedâadjuredâyet might not dare To whisper that unto the listening airâ All other means and methods tried I stillâ But shrunk from thatâand yet I must fulfil; She stands the sworn selected oracleâ And her dark presence I must yet compell.â Mah. But hear me farther!âI step in to spare!â Thou shalt not brave that suffering!âhear!âI swear; I swear by all yon burning stars that rollâ With searching lightâthat looks into the soul;â By death and lifeâand that most awful spell, Which seems the wreck of all things to foretell; By all that love hath taught meâhis distress, His conquering powersâhis shuddering happiness; By the uustaunched blood that weighs upon thy head,â If this be needfulâmine, ev'n mine to shed!â Aye!âby thy victim's lost, lost soul I swear, To crown myself the next!âbut sayââPrepare!ââ And with dread joy will I embrace my fate, The torment and the triumph consummate! One word from thee should snatch my Spirit back, From the unseen bourneâalong the untrodden track! But if such should not be thy law, thy willâ Then will I liveâthy slave and minion stillâ Thinkâbreatheâactâhopeâfeelâdo and deem and dareâ But as thou givest me licence!âthus I swear!â Adr. Now mak'st thou me to mourn my blasted state, Since I must bless thee not!âthou bright and great!â Live!âand be more than ever loved!âI feelâ That thou art made for me, through woe and weal; Fearâfateâand chanceâand changeâI feel with pride, Thou art my being's mate!âmy spirit's bride!â Live! if earth yet indeed can holdâdetainâ A soul of such vast scopeâso wide a reignâ Ha!âwho approachethâwith calm aspect brightâ An angel's form, and garmented in light.â Enter Adah. Adah. Mahala! I rejoice we thus have met! My childhood's sweet companionâcherished yetâ And through affection's golden sympathiesâ Homed in my heartâthough rent be the olden ties: Though absence long hath frowned our souls between, And we are wanderers from each well-known sceneâ Hail!âwelcome me, Mahala!âstill thou art The fair and gracious sister of my heart.â Mah. I welcome thee!âmy childhood's gentlest friend, And clasp in love the hand thou dost extend; Returning lovingly thy greetings allâ How doth thy presence that flown past recall!â Adah. Aye! sweet Mahala!âwhen together we Linked hand and hand, light bounded merrily, To catch the butterfly, or chase the bird, Like them, half-hovering in the air unheard!â So free those footstepsâcare had ne'er delayed, So light these hearts, no grief had earthwards weighed; Yet holier recollections softening come, And snatch me back to that beloved home. Rememberest thou how solemnly we feltâ When whispering prayers, together down we kneltâ Together sent our sister-souls to heaven, And prayed to be protectedâbless'dâforgiven. Long have these memories haunted me, and late With yearnings gracious and affectionateâ Once more with thee would I Heaven's grace implore, Join in thanksgivings, and in prayers once more!â Mah. Enough!âI cannot commune with thee nowâ Farewell!âI must departâ Adah. But hear me thou!â Most dear Mahala!âEven return with me Unto my father's tentsâthere welcomed be!â For he will joy with me to view that face, So beauteous now with youth's consummate grace;â Return with me, awhile midst us to dwell, And share my tasks and dutiesâis it well?â Mah. 'Tis well!âsweet sister of my youthâand yet My tasksâmy duties, must I not forget! Know, since we shared one prayer, one play, one sleep, Wild changes have come o'er me, dark and deep: Youth's toys and gewgaws have I left behind, And heap'd with knowledge high my waken'd mindâ My thoughts are turned to strange and lofty thingsâ Mine are proud dreams, and bright imaginingsâ Keen burning aspirationsâyearnings strong, That like winged gusts drive all my soul along The wonders of creation, scarce revealed, And charming more the more they are concealed, The mysteries that around us throng and teem, These things, and more inspire my mounting dream. I cannot come with thee!âfor I must watch Through noon and evening and the night, to catch Dim hints and faint illuminings, and store My mind with knowledge deep, not grasped before, When searching stars are trembling o'er my head, I question these of glorious truths and dread, And awful visions are vouchafed to me That radiate far into the eternityâ And startling scenes rise up before my sight, That deep'ning spread till lost in more than light, And solemn whispers warn me from afar, Profound and piercing and oracular!â I cannot come with thee!â Adah. Ah!âyet unsay!â Yet come and pass with me one long, bright day Thou revellest in the dreams of worlds unseen, Perchance unborn!âthat are, or that have been A glorious spectacle is Nature stillâ Right well her wondrous part doth she fulfil!â A glorious spectacle's the universeâ In every phase and function!âchange and course, And doubtless with majestic triumphs fraught, Glow the aspirations of ambitious thought!â But manâweak man should not alone aspire. Fixed should he be on high ere he soar higher!â A nobler task's appointed unto him, A loftier aim be his!âhis thoughts may swim Midst worlds unnumbered, in luxurious strife, With glorying phantasies sublimely rifeâ With triumphâmystery and victorious power; Yet nobler is the self-restraining hour!â The hour of contrite tears and humble cares, The exalting hour of penitence and prayers!â Oh!âlet him make his soul, schooled long and well, In Heaven's own eye a glorious Spectacle!â More precious thousand-fold than worlds that move In measured harmonyânot conscious love! Thisâthis, were worthy of creation's heirâ This proves his proudest taskâhis loftiest care. Not all life's burning hopes and dreams august Can match the humility that clasps the dust! Let me but win thee to her ways again, Thou'lt hug her burthensâand thou'lt kiss her chain. Mah. Not so!âthou little know'st me!âHence!âaway! A prisoned storm seems struggling in this clay! My soul was born to soar and to aspireâ Its thoughts are tempestsâand its feelings fire!â All joins to wake, to stirâtouchâthrillâcreateâ Rouseâraise that burning soul above its fate!â Humility!âI may not know the word!â My swelling bosom owns no answering chordâ Joyâjoyâto feel the mysteries of the mind With all the mysteries hid from manâcombinedâ The incomprehensibilities of Thought Into one luxury of aspiring wrought! While strong emotionsâfervid longings blend To one rich exultation without end!â Adah. Yet hear me!âbear with me!âdost mind thee not Still of the o'ershadowing treeâour favourite spot?â The accustomed haunt of our bright happiness, Where kneeled we nightly, praying Heaven to blessâ Rose not thy childish thoughts e'en then on high?â Sprang not thine infant mind to the op'ning sky?â Hath not Religion too her rapt delights?â Hath charmed Devotion no victorious flights?â Hadst thou continued in their paths to move, New triumphs had accorded been to love!â New inspirationsâin progressive power Had heightened all the joys of prayer's calm hour! Is Heaven indeed not high enough for thee?â Not scope sufficient is the Eternity?â Is He not worthy of thy praise who made Those wonders, thou so gladly hast surveyed?â Doth His dread throne all veiled in blinding lightâ Not satisfy thy quest?âreward thy flight?â Once more with me prayer's boundless blessings prove, And own no wonder like the Heavenly Love! Adr. Something too much of pious preaching thisâ Its end shall be beginning of our bliss! Peace!âwoman!âpeace!âwhen thy advice we ask, Renew the tame, trite themeârepeat the task. Adah. I did not thee adviseânot counsel thee, Thou graceless man of gloomy mystery!â Irreverend scorner!âthat in sullen moodâ In savage silence near, hast frowning stoodâ Methinks I know thee!âart not thou the man Proscribed, beneath some stern, tremendous banâ Art thou not he that from the righteous way Hast led of late my much-changed sire astray? Yes! thou art the man! and Heaven, in mercy, spare My gray-haired father from thy murtherous snare!â Him hast thou madeâI speak with shudd'ring sighâ Of thy black deeds the associate and the ally!â Him hast thou made thy comrade in thy causeâ Some foul rebellion 'gainst the eternal laws!â Thy comradeâaye!âyet, dark apostate!âhear! He is notânever can be madeâthy peer! First in the rank of crime shalt thou be class'dâ Ev'n by the infernal spirits unsurpassed! Adr. In pity to thyself, but pause awhile! I answer with compassionating smile! My peer!âno!âno!âthou need'st not nurse that dread. Well say'st thou, he hath followed where I led!â He dreams we have one schemeâone strifeâone sphereâ One aimâone objectâis the worm my peer?â (Aside.) He knows not mine, dull dotard!âvain and blind; But his is fathomed by my searching mind! Apostate?âI fling back that charge to theeâ Thyselfâaccuse of cold apostacyâ Weak woman!âto thy glorious race a stain!â Flows in such veins the haughty blood of Cain?â Hence! with thy fulsome preaching and foul prateâ Art thou elected portress of heaven's gate?â Say, are heaven's keys committed to thy hands?â Hopest thou to draw us with such slippery bands?â Aadh. To thee I speak no more!âMahala!âcome!â Hasteâhasteâand share with me one hopeâone homeâ Seize, crown the occasion now and bless the hour!â Leave this unrighteous man of evil powerâ This ruined being lostâaccursedâabhorredâ This man of impious deed and impious word. Leave him!âere wilder things he speak and worseâ Consign him to his conscienceâand his curse! Contamination in his presence dwellsâ Sinâruinâdeathâare in his godless spells!â Mah. Leave?âleave?âI love even as thou lovest Him, Whose chariot is the fiery cherubim! Leave him?âI love him as thou lov'st the Lord! And his I am in thought and deed and word, My deepest soul is bound to his for everâ Thus hurl I back thine answerâneverânever! Adah. Worse woe!âand wilt thou lose for him thine all, And face the precipiceâprovoke the fall, And yield thine immortality of bliss For such a lost blaspheming wretch as this? Mah. Discourse not me of immortality!â If love reign not, what can it beâto be! I tell ye, I had rather live One Hour,â One moment even of passion in its power, One moment of the burning, beating heart, When every pulse hath learned its own sweet part, Than linger through the eternity above, If that eternity be not of love!â That long, dark, immortality of soul, If love be not the deep life of the whole!â Aye!âI would gladlyâgloryingly compress All my soul's faculties of happinessâ Its rushing strengthsâits heaven-enkindled firesâ Its battling zeal, that all awakesâinspiresâ Its every stormy energy and power!â Willsâdreams and thoughts into that feeling hour, Ratherâyea! rather would do thus by far Than count vain ages in some colder star!â Love hath its own eternity!âIt is Its own rich immortality of bliss!â And through its powerâthrough its resistless lawsâ All joy from Past and Future conquering draws.â I will not leave him! he is as my soul, One thought of him doth all my thoughts controul. I cannot leave himâI am hisâall his!â In life or death, in misery or in bliss!â Thou tell'st me still of mine immortal Soul, Which shall not die while suns and planets roll; Mine everlasting Life, which cannot fail, Though stars and suns and systems wane and pale. I tell thee of my deep, immortal Loveâ Which lives while life is found beneathâaboveâ I cannot leave him!âNo!âwe must not part!â My Soul hath spoken!âthou hast heard my Heart! Adah. Alas! thy daring and distempered thought Another lesson may ere long be taught! If not for thine own sake, thou wilt forswear The fatal paths of doubt and of despairâ For his consentâfor his sole sake complyâ Thy prayers might yet appease the offended sky! Thy zealous deeds of good, perchance, might yet Win heaven for himâon whom thy love is setâ How couldst thou bearâto aid all powerlessâbear To see the eternal throes of his despair? Thine own forgotten in his darker fateâ Bethink thee well!âpauseâpause ere 'tis too late! Couldst bear his pangsâwhich thou mightst not assuage? Since thou should'st see his sufferings, age by age!â Mah. Oh! thou Omnipotentâdread mystery! From these fierce threats I do appeal to Thee! Crush not thine own creation in my soul!â Loveâlove, thine offspring, lives throughout the whole! Hear thine own voice that from its depths doth riseâ The voice of love, on earth as in the skiesâ Perfectâimmortal!ânot for me I prayâ Kill all my soul!âspare his! in thy great sway!â Heaven!âHeaven!âcrush down my writhing soulâor give An infinite of life for it to liveâ And all one torture!âI care notâso he Be blessed and spared for all felicity! [She faints. Adr. Begone! thou hateful babbler!âdost come here To cloud that noble soul with gloom and fear?â Back to thy tents!âor I will conjure round Foul fiends to bear thee to their lairs profound! Adah. I do not fear thee! sorcerer!âbut I goâ Since vain my mission now, I fearâI knowâ Yet will I seek Mahala once again, And strive with her proud heartâev'n though in vain!â [Exit Adah. Mahala, (recovering.) I tremble!âwho will succourâwho shall save?â Heard'st thou that threat'ning angel of the grave?â No! 'twas my gentle Adahâmild and meek! Couldst thou such words of curdling horror speak?â Ah! did I act it well? my soul!âreply!â When dared I proudly those high truths defy! While not one word she spoke but thrilled meâmoreâ Woke thousand echoes in my bosom's core! Support me hence!âBeloved One!âstern and rude To me seems now the oppressive solitudeâ Lo! let us seek thy brethrenâall my heart Is sick to deathâquick!âlet us hence depart! [Exeunt.

Another day is sinking with yon sun, Not so the undying deeds its hours saw done! Thou mighty luminary!âThou shalt pale, Ere aught man thinks, or acts, or feels can fail!â King!âwhose regalia are thy raysâwhose right The chartered power o'er all to pour thy light; Glorious Impostor!âwhile on thee we gaze, Flooding the heavens with thine imperial blaze; Sublime and proud misrepresentative Of all worlds and all systemsâwe believe Thou'rt what thou seemstâand dost affect to beâ The light and life of all the immensity!â That splendour, matchlessâmatelessâshines thine own, That thou'rt thyself the centre and the crown, The soul and sovereign in thy mastering course, The chief and conqueror of the universe!â But 'tis not so!âmidst many thou'rt but One!â Thou dost deceive us with thy pompâthou sun!â Myriads as wonderous and as bright as thou, Fulfil rejoicingly their courseâev'n now!â Uncountedâunconceivedâa splendid hostâ All more than excellentâand none the most!â Myriads on myriadsâmerged and mingled so, Thought cannot grasp their sumânor glimpse their show!â Perchance i' the distanceâto an angel's eye, These cling into one gorgeous Unity!â Lostâall the immensities of space between, One luxury of blent light the whole vast scene!â The innumerable splendours crowd to One, And Space appears a universal Sun! Not so with us! the One to us seems All!â So far behind thy pomps the others fall!â Not so with us!âo'er us thou showerest down The illuminations of thy fiery crown!â To blind us to the wonder and the pride Of thousandâthousand radiant orbs beside! Were we not made familiar with thy light, Those sparkling worlds that shine but when 'tis night, Might proveâstar after starâand sphere by sphere, As many Suns to Sense, out-shining clear!â Though now with trembling and unequal beam, A loosely-scattered seed of light they seem; A sprinkled seed of glory!âwaiting still, (While meekly these the appointed course fulfil,) For the everlasting and the almightiest breath Of that command which bade thee gild our path, (While thou dost seem, with such o'erpow'ring prideâ To shine unmatchedâunaidedâunallied)â But is it thus?âmy science tells meâno!â Those distant globes with like resplendence glow; 'Tis thine accustomed and close-neighbouring rays, That still out-lustre all the Heavens a-blaze!â Thus Light's extreme might strangely seem to be, The parent of some shadowy mystery!â The engenderer of a dreamy darkness so, E'en the over-brightness of the all-dazzling show!â Since theyâthe o'ershadowedâfail for us to shed, The ethereal splendours richly round them spread! Yet, is it well with us, thou shin'st so near, Thou lord of heat and light, benignant sphere! The climes and seasons know thee and obey; Not splendour only pours from thy proud ray!â That fruitfulness which clothes the earth and crowns, Thy rich creative, fostering influence owns: All things on the earth their colourings take from thee, And thou art seen in all that man can see!â Not barren glory is thy gift alone, With boons more bless'd hast thou our pathways strown; Thou stirrest all nature to harmonious strife; Thou smilest!âfertility hath leapt to life;â How graciously doth earth new charms assumeâ Rich vegetation's variegated bloom!â Through all her mighty veinsâhow brightly gush The quickening currents, till she grows one blush!â Her flowersâher fruitsâher wealth of deeps and minesâ Through eachâin allâthy mastering triumph shinesâ The very clouds that seem to veil thy face But run obedient to thy lawsâtheir raceâ The enchanter, as the enlightenerâSun!âart thou, Of all great nature's realmsâsupremely now!â Howe'er when systems change and time expires, We may o'erlook thy merged and fading fires!â Thou bidd'st us breathe and moveâand smile and liveâ And all this nature craves 'tis thine to giveâ Yon marshalled systems glimmeringâstrangely far, Might shed down heavenlier splendours from their carâ Might wear more proud refulgence to our eyes, And viewed from earth, shine lovelier in the skies, If thou wert notâthou Sun!âto whom seems given The pride of all the hierarchies of Heaven!â But severed by unbounded wastes of space, With richer gifts of good should fail to grace, One desert, and one drouth should she be made, An icy wreckâmocked, blighted, and dismayed! Beholding those thronged luminaries shine, But feeling not their influence all benign!â Glorious Preserver!âecho of the Word!â Thou bright vicegerent of the eternal Lord!â My thoughts retract their bold presumptuous strain, And bless thy Sovereign Singleness again! Thy proud monopoly of missioned might, Thy conquering lordliness and centered light! But soft!âwhat shape steals o'er my solitude, Hushed as some dream that soothes the watcher's moodâ Its countenanceâmore shadowy than throned Nightâ Yetâlike a Heaven in Ruins!âdarkly bright?â Enter Lucifer. What art thou? Shape of awe, and wrath, and gloom, That steal'st as from the silence of the tombâ And with the silence of our frozen death, That changeth not?âreply!âif thou hast breath!â What art thou, awful shapeâof fate and fear? What doth thy terror and thy beauty here? Luc. Methinks that thou shouldst know meâthis is not The first time I have hailed thee!âhast forgot?â Jai. Ha!âthat wild glance, like some onsweeping stormâ The chaos-beauty of that sovereign form!â It is a towering majesty of gloomâ And treads the world like some Tremendous Doom!â My soul seems lost before itâI remainâ Like one who swooneth with o'ertorturing pain; And dazzledâbut by what?âby Darkness drear?â Which doth the ascendant in that guise appear? Though in the mystery of that aspect lies The heights and depths of light's regalitiesâ Beneath its tread earth grows one angry tombâ Declare!âwhat art thou?âspeak!âStupendous Gloom!â Pronounce!âThou swart and shadowy-lowering Sun! That look'st Eclipse and Empireâboth in One! That makest all nature round thee wear thy faceâ And seem'st out-measuring all the unbounded space!â Luc. I was!âI say to theeâI am not now!â I was!âand will beâmust I more avow?â Jai. It is enough!âI know theeâbut too well, The Infernal great Incomprehensible!â I see the thunder-withered browâthe throne Of thoughts still conquerorsâthough in acts undone! But, sayâthou discrowned Desolation!âwhyâ Deign'st thou thus parley with mortality?â Luc. Know that in heart and hopeâin mind and mood, Between us two is strange similitudeâ In either will the workings are the sameâ We move united by one common aimâ Full oftâfrom thee concealedâhave I dwelt nearâ Bent to thy thoughts my spiritual ear!â Full oft in deep disguise have been at hand,â For various aspects I at will command!â My presence thusâhalf hid and half expressed, Methinks by thee was ofttimes glimpsed and guessed; A vague, strange consciousness of mystic kindâ Oft deepening to assurance chained thy mindâ Jai. This may be soâbut what thou hast seenâwhat heard, Proves not that likenessâthus by thee averred!â I tell thee that mine aim, my hope, my will, War 'gainst thine own unconquerably stillâ I tell thee that my deep and dear design, Through all its parts, antagonizeth thine;â Wide as is heaven from earth, or earth from theeâ My purpose is from what thine own can be! Speak then of such similitude no moreâ The words thou utteredst wrung my heart before!â No common aim unites usâHeaven forefend, In nought my soul shall with thy spirit blend. Luc. Tame down thy daring tongue, vain mortal! how?â Must I brook thy fierce taunts? keep silence thou!â Before thy clay tribunal shall I stand, And ask for favouring judgements at thy hand?â Thouâborn to perish as thou shaltâand mustâ What!âshall I stoop me to thy dust of dust? I deemed our spirits with one hope were fraught; I did exalt thee by the very thought!â Sublime advancement and promotion proudâ To be my comrade and ally avowed!â What liv'st for, miserable earthling, save To dig the ground thou dropp'st intoâthy grave? Thou that presumest, in so guardless hour, To rouse mine angerâand to brave my power, What art thou, rash and frontless dreamer, say, That bragg'st it thusâthou helpless child of clay; Through measured graduations that wouldst soar, And with thy grovelling soul the All exploreâ Part after part, that day by day would'st seize The harmonious wholeâand spring by poor degrees!â Aye! by degrees would'st springâwould'st piecemeal learn! Whilst nobler spirits at one glance discern!â With gradual growth and grasp thy cabined mind Exalt, enlargeâand free from thralls that bindâ Thy labouring thought, with slow research improve, And through the immense with painful progress move; Heave up thy cold conception's lingering weight, A wearying toilâto tremble at heaven's gate! Jai. Proud fiend! avaunt!âI feel my spirit rise, Instinct with sovereign breathings of the skies; Though now a tenant of this lower earth, I feel the inherent greatness of my birth;â And though a thing of clayâa child of dust, I stand upon the strength of that high trust, And hurl my soul's defianceânay!ânot so; Thou'rt fallen!âand pitiably thou now liest low: Thou'rt fallen indeed!âas they must fall who fail, When all their fate hangs trembling in the scale, In depths of degradation and defeat, Doomed to submitâand destined to retreat;â And I may deign not, darkly to debase Myself to thee!âthou exile of all space!â Which 'twere to risk, could I thus stoop to mar My bosomed peace,âby waging wordy warâ By trying hard conclusions thus with One Who needs forbearanceâruined and undone; Thy wretched stateâcondemned to dreadful Fame, Should sufferance craveâcommiseration claimâ Must plead for mercy, and must prompt to graceâ And wring compassion e'en from man's wronged raceâ Thou crushed apostateâby earth's least out-towered, Anarch subdued!âand rebel all o'erpowered!â I grant that graceâpoor fiend!âI pity thee.â Luc. Ha! dar'st thou?âpity! pity!âmust this be? Oh! Hell! thou'st taught no tortures!âmust I bow? Lost Heaven! I never felt my Fall till now! Till nowâI never, never, felt my Fallâ Now grinds the torment, and now grates the thrall, Now wounds the chastisementânow wrings the check, Now blastsânow blights, the unmeasured wasteâand wreck, The Immensity of Ruinâstarts and stares Before me nowâand my fixed glance reglares; Horrors and Humiliations round me crowd, And shut like seas above me!âI have bowed!â The imperious will's unconquerable strength Hath wanedâhath withered from my soul at length, The indignant scorn and the all-inspiring hate Hath sunk beneath some icy mountain's weightâ For like ice-mountains on my spirit piled, These cankering consciousnesses, dimmedâdefiledâ Down crush me, shudderingly, to death's own dust, Death!âto my sovereign sufferance, still unjust!â No!âno!âI never felt my Fall before!â Yet feel as I had writhed for evermore; Feel ev'n as though, from my creation's first, I had been ever lost!âthe abhorredâthe accursed. I never knew my depths of loss till now; And 'tis to thee this sharpened sense I oweâ To thee, thouâworm!âHis instrument of wrath, Who raised a reptile thing to blight my path; Myriads and myriads of His Angels failed To wound me thusâbut thouâthou hast well assailed!â Well hast thou stung the Steeled Oneâand 'tis thine To bid the last rays of lost suns unshine!â The latest rays of my lost sun to quench, And teach the Indomitable Pride to blench!â Lower than low thou'st smitten me; I sinkâ As though till now I had but neared the brink!â Be proud!âsince thou couldst thus victoriously Smite him who towered the highest midst the high;â But tremble!âlest his vengeance should o'ertake, Nor deign to spare thee for thy weakness' sake!â Ha! agony of agonies!âthat thoughtâ That wordâwhat!âpity!âoh! 'tis wormwood fraught! Away!âavoid my sight! I will not beâ Indebted to thy groundling sympathy!â Jai. Haughtiest, if not the highest!âit is well My tongue was taught thine impious pride to quell, And prove to thee how lostâhow last thy place, How black thy forfeitâboundless thy disgrace,â How less than littleâlower than low thou artâ How ill thou'st played thine ill and evil part!â How, midst thy giant failures, thou hast lost Thyselfâthyselfâimmeasurably the most!â Lord of celestial realms! what own'st thou now?â What is thy swayâthine empireâwho art thou? Luc. I was! Jai. And say! canst thou pronounce that word! Nor feel the sharpening of the avenging sword? Thatâthat must be the madness of thy thoughtâ (If phrenzy might in ruth to thee be taught,) Thou wast!âthe annihilation of despairâ Blasts all thy beingâleaves its huge void there. Luc. I will be! Jai. Kneel then to the eternal throneâ Thus canst thou be restoredâand thus alone.â Luc. How!âkneel?ârestored?âpoor mortal!âthy weak brain Can but revolve crude nothingsâvague and vainâ I wasâI will be!âlet all come to passâ Still mine the boastâI will be stillâI was!â Kneel!ânot for the Universe I claimed and lost:â Though heavens were heaped on heavens, like His thronged host; Not for the Orbed Sovereignties I strove to gain, Though more than multiplied that Realm and Reign! How!âbe restored?âregain my rule and rankâ Not though I heed, nor supplicate, nor thank!â 'Twere worse that base inferior place to holdâ Than thus to wanderâfreed from heaven's cribbed fold! Nowâlet what may be lostâI still can be Imperial in mine Independency!â Thinkst thou my Feud is o'er?âI tell theeâNO!â Nor wilt be pastâtill All that isâbe so!â I am One Battle!âmine immortal life Is one unceasing marshalry of strife;â I am the unpausingâthe unextinguished war!â As, through my meansâall things for ever are!â At least in this I conquered!âI conceivedâ And nobly my proud purpose I atchieved!â This new creation of conflicting powersâ Born to exhaust the eternities as hours!â The Chaos He from Matter breathed away, Through me transferred to Mind shall fiercelier sway; Yet glorying will I makeâI swear to thee!â Heaven's sphered immensities my anarchyâ Through all the regions of all power and placeâ The extensions and expansions of all space,â Yea! to the Innumerable of Worlds will say, âBe uncreation!ââso shall they obey!â Thus all my desolation shall become My great Despairâmy Darkness, and my Doom!â The worksâworldsâwondersâof the all-powerful handâ Shall be the Chaos of my dread Command!â I will destroy their rare perfection stillâ Make the brightâdarkâthe goodâto be most ill!â So stars and spheres shall passâshall fall away, For I will teach themâchange, wrong, gloom, decayâ Through evil's sapping presenceâblighting breathâ That makes of Immortality one Death!â These crowding systems, thronged throughout the immense, With method in their proud magnificence!â Those nations massed and mingled without end, Where all degrees and orders seem to blend;â Those heights and depths, beyond all thought and dream, Which still with miracles of glory teem; Those endless regions, that know nought of bound, That wait to be with new creations crowned;â All yet shall wither to my wasteâmy wreck,â And know the terror of the eternal check! Eachâthough awhile untouchedâshall grow my toolâ All be my Ruinâand thus own my Rule!â I say to thee throned worlds shall smile and shine, Only to feel a Fallâas dire as mine!â What though creations fresh may spring up there, To fill the blank, and that dark loss repairâ These in their turn shall perish and depart; So shall the whole of Nature rue my Art! From meâthrough me came strife and dearth and wrath, Through meâDestruction and the powers of Death!â Yet wherefore speak I thus to thee?âwhose thought Can ne'er the mysteries of these truths be taught? Lost, lost in the Infinite!âwhich beings made Like me the Undyingâsole can view displayed. Jai. Forbear to boast!âthou dark and dreadful guest, As though thy Worst were better than the Best! Say'st thou my Thought, in its high soaring sway, Is lost in the outstretched Infinite?âaway!â I tell thee the Infinite itself is lostâ In my large thoughtâev'n where 'tis boundless most!â I tell thee that 'tis hidden in my Thought, Lostâin its depthsâtill through its power rewrought! Then multiplied and made more vast, more wide, With thousand Vastnesses conjoined beside!â Yea! I may be the creature of to-dayâ Heir of corruption, as the child of clayâ I may be cooped in fleshly coil and crustâ Time's victim madeâas the offspring of the dustâ True!âI may pine in this most petty form!â I may be as thou saidst!âYea!âam a wormâ But knowâthou dark and envious spiritâknow!â (My soul cries out of me that it is so!) My Thoughts are Gods!âand suns shall cease to burn Ere they,âonce roused,âto Chaos shall return! They never shall to Chaos sink again, Beyond Creation are they called to reign!â Thereâthereâthy power is vainâthy sway is nought. I hurl thee from my seventh-staged heaven of thought!â Even to the horrent Hades of thine own, In blackness of all darknessâmost unknownâ Leave meâI pray thee leave meâI would seek To raze from memory, that I heard thee speak!â Thou that wouldst fain even yet a conqueror prove, And make thy lowest outweigh all above:â Thou talk'st of deathâa fancy-monstered thing!â Still, still I feel that Heaven will blunt his sting. I feel this clay must perishâbut ne'er doubt, The Mind joined with it shall live bestâwithout!â Let chaos seize creation once again;â Let anarchyâthe wildest, widest reign;â Let systemsâspheresâworldsâuniverses sink; Mind can dream Worldsâwhole Universes think!â All space may failâall matter wane or meltâ That never dies which hath been thought and feltâ Eternal as its Maker is the Mindâ Spread ruin roundâbut there thy limit find!â Luc. No!âson of earth!â'tis there I yet shall most Reap deadliest triumphâthough all else be lost! There shall my victories blaze!âthere vast success Create for me new Heavens of Happiness!â Through Man and through his Mind shall I yet wield Tremendous armsâand take once more the fieldâ Once more the armed, helmed Antagonist shall move, And shake the far-forefended realms above; Brave the full-orbed Omnipotencies there, And all their terrorsâall their triumphs dareâ The Hierarchic Chivalries of Heaven defy, And snatch mankind too from the impoverished skyâ As the third part of its proud chiefs I drew With me away!âits failureâbut my due!â Then will I rear elate, height after height, My Pyramids of Worlds, in Thrones sun-bright!â And make destruction's self more glorious far Than all perfection, which His marvels are!â I goâyet, mortal!âhush!âspare speech! 'twere vainâ Look to behold meâand ere longâagain! [Exit Lucifer. Jai. From this most fall'n, lost being let me now Turn my tranced thoughts to theeâthe Almightiest! Thou That wert his conquerorâas thou must be still, Of all who dare to stand 'gainst thy high will. Oh! marvel of all mystery!âwho can sound Thy being's awfulnessâwithout a bound. What we adore in thee, thou dread Eterne; What we can of that mightiest mystery learn, Are surely but thine after-attributes, So vain our judgments' founts, our wisdom's fruits. To thee imputes our reason, false and frail, (That ne'er may hope those wondrous heights to scale,) Those things we reck of Thee!âthose things alone As of supreme necessityâthine own!â Necessity! 'tis the echo of thy law, And waits thy bidding, ere it dare to draw Its being from Thy breath!âor rather say The cold unbeing of its soulless sway, Which can but follow where thou dost direct, And trace its paths prescribedâurg'd, led, or checkedâ And never, Lord of Lords, could come near thee, Till bade to comeâthe austere Necessity!â Thou didst conceive Necessityâand call From very nothing its stern secrets all!â And in some broodingâsome self-counselled hour, Thou willedst Will!âand thou createdst Power!â Lo! was not once all Deity?âtill thou, Before whom hosts must trembleâworlds must bow, Didst separate (as in strong times less remote, Whose memory yet doth o'er the present floatâ Thou well dividest Darkness from the Lightâ Time from the Eternity with conquering might,) Aye!âwith dread wisdom separate and divide, Yet, laying no part of Thy State aside!â Full Deity from Itself!âand bade arise A frame of things in independent guise, A race of living beingsâfreeâdistinct, By bonds of heavenly love alone enlinkedâ No more one Universe of Deity!â Not allâone boundless Infinite of Thee!â Not Thee!âthough of Theeâthrough Theeâfrom Thee stillâ Born of thy breathâand wrought but through thy will!â My soul is heavyâthe condemned One's words Thrilled but too painfully my spirit's chords Hence! ghastly dread!âI cannot surely be Leagued with the Infernal Immortality; Yet, when he uttered, with that scorn-wreathed lip Hintsâmoreâstern charges of companionshipâ Methought a still small voice was roused within, That witnessed faintly to some treacherous sin: Can it indeed be, mine august designâ (Made in my sight almost a thing divine,) Is touched with evil.âNo!â'tis not so!ânoâ It may not be! it must notâ'twere worst woe!â My daughter's gentlest presence let me seek; Smooth consolationsâher meek tongue shall speak! [Exit Jairah. SCENE II. âPart of a Forest. Enter Jairah. Jai. Methought but now I marked the bright Unknown Pass o'er this pathâwith measured steps and loneâ His neighbouring presence makes the seas of soul Surely in boundless brightness smoothened roll!â 'Tis even so!âIn chastened glory now, See!âhe approaches with benignant brow!â Enter the Unknown Spirit. Unknown Spirit. Hail!âmortal!âPeace be with thee! fear thou not! Nought evil comes near this now hallowed spot!â Jai. An evil power hath walk'd with me of lateâ Thou know'st it!âthou know'st all!âthou good and great! But none know thee!âOh! tell me what thou art, So from disquietudes shall cease this heart. Unknown Spi. I am of those who wish all good to man, Ev'n now while suffering under brand and ban. Enquire not furtherâlet thus much sufficeâ Nor curious be, nor scrupulously niceâ I am of those who, wishing mercy still For humankindâbut serve their Maker's will. How did the Other speak with thee?âand sayâ Did he much strive to win thee from the way! Jai. He spoke of horror still and hideous doom, And far into my soul cast his dread gloom! Threatenings and thunderings of despair he spoke,â His neck is wounded sore by the awful yoke!â And dost thou ne'er behold him, when abroad, He chooseth thus at willâuncheckedâhis road?â Unknown Spi. NayâI have seen him not since that great hour When he succumbed before the Eternal Power, That mightiest moment of his blank defeatâ When Dread with Dread seemed endlessly to meetâ That moment of tremendous wrath untold, Whose terrors lips nor language could unfold! That momentâMemory's self may ne'er rehearse!â When Boundless Godheadâwas the Universe!â Sinceâdeadenedâstunnedâby wonder's tranced excessâ Checked through the amazement's hushed unconsciousness, Crushed down by the all-annihilating Awe, Nor Spirits free nor fall'nâfeltâheardâor saw!â Whole systems writhedâflashedâand were not!âas flames Sway'd by fierce windsâextinguished like spent aimsâ Duration checked itselfâthe eternityâ Appeared to have surceasedâas nought might be! The Eternityâthe Eternityâstood still!â And nought survived but Himâthe Wordâthe Willâ Space and the extension seemed collapsedâand allâ More than participating in that Fall!â Thenâas there was Beginningâsprang and rose Mysteries of gloryâspeech might ne'er disclose!â Aye!âas there was Beginning!âfor new-born Those myriads seemedâas 'twere creation's morn!â Snatched from the jaws of that Obstruction's Deathâ When the Infinite forgot all living breath!â Caught from the depths of that Oblivion's Doom, Which made the Illimitable yawnâone tomb!â Still when arose quick thought and life again, Resuming then their interrupted reign, One thoughtâone Thought of God arose aloneâ Still the Universeâwas the Universe's Throne!â There, the great Love,âth' Awe,âHopeâth' Amazement flowedâ Creation thrilledâOne Consciousness of God! Then burst the hosts and hierarchies of heaven, (To whose armed hand the victory's might was given,) Into the enraptured strength of joy's full strain, The hallelujatick songs broke forth again!â Wide waved the emblazoned banners of their pride, The enzodiacked swords flashed, sheathless, at their side, Since like effulgent zodiacks shivering beamed Their glittering bauldricksâthat far-flaming gleamed, While at their shoulders shone transcendent things Their golden Harpsâtheir quivered Warâtheir Wings!â Such splendour round them shedding with such sway, That suns were spots of darkness on their day! As they and all their pride of glory's lightâ Wereâon the Shadow of the Bright of Bright! [To be continued.]</field>
