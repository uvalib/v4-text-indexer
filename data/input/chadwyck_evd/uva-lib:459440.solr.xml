      <field name="fulltext">All the Charges and Expences of this present Ovation; being the sole undertaking of the Right Worshipfull Company of the Ironmongers. The 29. of October, Anno Salutis. 1635.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">âRedeunt Spectacula,â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT Honorable, Christopher Clethrowe, Lord Maior of this Renowned Metropolis, London,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I shall not neede to borrow my Induction from the Antiquitie of this Famous Metropolis, nor to enter into a large discourse, of the noble Magistracy and government thereof; being Arguments already granted, and therefore unnecessary to be disputed: and yet I hold it not altogether Impertinent to remember some few things of remarke, which have happened in the PrÃ¦torships of the Right Honourable, the Lord Maiors of this Renowned Citie, who have beene Free of the Right Worshipfull Company of the Iron-mongers. In the year 1409, Richard Marloe, of the same Fraternitie, bearing the Sword, there was a Show presented by the Parish Clerkes of London, at a place called Skinners Well, and now Clerken Well, which was of matter from the Creation of the World; and lasted for the space of Eight Intyre dayes: Edward the Fourth (then King) being present with his Queene, and the greatest part of his Nobilitie, which Richard Marloe, was after Inaugurated Into the same Honor, Anno 1417. In the yeere 1566. Sir Christopher Draper, being Lord Maior, King Iames, of late and most Sacred memory, was borne the Sixth day of June, Anno 1569. In Sir Alexander Avenons Maioralty, was the suppression of the Rebells in the North, Anno 1581. Sir Francis Harvey being Mayor, was the French Mounsiers comming over into England, and his Royall entertainement by Queene Elizabeth, Anno 1607. Sir Thomas Cambel being Invested into the same Honor: All the like Showes and Triumphs belonging unto the solemnitie of this day, which for some yeeres, had beene omitted and neglected, were by a speciall commandement from his Majestie, King Iames, againe retained, and have beene till this present day continued; whom since hath succeeded in the same Honor, Sir Iames Cambel, his Sonne, a worthy Senator of this Citie, yet living. (The last of this worthy and Worshipfull Company, who hath sate in that seate of Iustice) now this day succeeded by the Right Honourable, Christopher Clethrowe: but I leave all circumstances, and come to the Showes, now in present Agitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first Showe by Water: Is an Artificiall Moddell, partly fashioned like a Rock, and beautified with sundry varieties, and rarities, in all which Art (in Imitating) striveth to exceed Nature: The Decorements that adorne the Structure, I omit, and descend to the Persons that furnish it, which are the Three CÃ¦lestiall Goddesses, Iuno, Pallas, Venus: In Iuno, is figured Power and State; In Pallas or Minerua, Arms and Arts; In Venus, Beautie and Love: The first best knowne by her Peacocks; the second by her Owles; the third by her Swans &amp; Turtles, who is also attended by her Sonne Cupid, in whom is Emblem'd Love; by whom some have thought, the Vniverse to have beene Created, because of the Beautie, Glory, and Flourishing forme thereof, as also, that Love (though pictured young) yet in Age exceeds all things: But Venus, because borne of the Seas, I hold most proper to speake upon the Waters: These Three Goddesses are sent from Jupiter, with severall Presents, to honour this dayes Triumphs, and him to whom they are devoted; Iuno brings Power, Pallas Wisedome, Venus Love; whose Speech is as followeth: Venus the Speaker. The Three CÅlestiall goddesses this day Descend (Grave PrÃ¦tor) to prepare your way To your new Oath, and Honor: Iove, whose station Is still above, hath sent to this Ovation And glorious Triumph, Vs: Iuno the great And Potent Queene; who to your Iurall seat, Brings State and Power: Pallas, who from Ioves brain Derives her selfe, and from the highest straine Of all the other gods, claimes her descent, Her Divine Wisedome, doth this day present. But I, Emergent Venus, Loves faire Queene, Borne of the Seas; and therefore best beseene To speake upon the Waters, bring a gift, Priz'd equally with theirs; that which shall lift You up on voyces, and from the low frame Of sordid Earth, give you (above) a name: From iust affections. and pure thoughts, Love springs, And these are Impt with no Icarian wings, But Plumes Immortall, such as Angels beare, To fixe your Name in an eternall spheare. Which to attaine; Take Iuno for your guide, Maintaine her Peacocks riches, not her pride; Who to prove all Earths glory is but vaine, Lookes but upon her feete, and flaggs her traine. Obserue next Pallas Owles, and from them take This notion; you must watch even as they wake: For all such as the management of state Shall undergoe, rise earlie, and bed late, So Wisedome is begot; from Wisedome Love, (Sweete Child of such a Parent) may't then prove: That as this day you doe attract the eyes, And expectation of the great, and wise, So in the happy progresse of your yeere, You may their hearts and soules to you Indeere: From Love, your Waters passage vnderstand, But Power and Wisedome wellcoms you on land. The next Modell by Land, which was onely showne upon the Water, is one of the twelue CÃ¦lestiall signes: Sagitarius called Croton; hee, before he was translated into the Heavens, was said to bee the Sagitarius. Sonne of Pan, and the Nimph Euphemes, and in his Infancy, was Conlacteus Musarum. i. Hee suckt of the same brest with the Muses, his mother being their Nurse and dwelt in Helicon; hee was Famous for his skill in Archerie, wonderous swift of foote, and when the Nine Sisters sung to their severall instruments of Musick, his custome was to dance before them in sundry active figures and postures. For which, and other indowments, knowne to be eminent in, hee was at their request to Iupiter translated amongst the starres, in the plat-forme, on which hee is borne: at the foure corners, are seated foure other dignified with the like Constellations: Virgo, best knowne by the Virgo. name of Astrea and Iusta, the daughter of Iupiter, and Themis; and for her Iustice and Integritie, thither transferr'd, and numbred amongst the Twelue: Next Ariadne, best knowne amongst Ariadne. the Astrologians, by the name of Corona, the Crowne, which was said to bee forged by Vulcan in Lemnos, the materialls thereof were Gold, and Indian Gemmes, of extraordinary splendor, which shee lending to Theseus at that time when her Father Minos had expos'd him to the Minotaure, by the luster thereof, hee passed freely through the darknesse of the Laborinth: Some say, it was first given her by Liberpater, or Bacchus, the Sonne of Iupiter and Semele, and was the price of her Virginitie: but howsoever, shee being most ingratefully forsaken by Theseus, in the Ile of Naxos; was there found by Bacchus, who having espoused her with great solemnitie, caused her after her death, with this Crowne to bee Inuested in the Firmament. The Third, Cassiopeia, Cassiopeia. the wife of Cepheus, who preferring her owne beautie before the Nereides, who were the daughters of Neptune, was for that insolence, doom'd to be bownd in a chayre, hand and foote, and so placed amongst the spheares, where shee remaines Conspicuous, in Thirteene Starres. The Fourth, is Andromeda, the Daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, Andromeda. who by the wrath of Neptune, being chain'd unto a Rocke, and ready to bee devoured by a Sea Monster, was delivered thence by Perseus, the Sonne of Iupiter, and DanaÃ¦, to whom being after married, was call'd Persa, and Stellified by Minerua: The Speaker is an Astrologian. [Astrologian] The Speech followeth: Late risen in the Heaven is Sagitary, (With you, great Lora) who doth about him carry Fifteene bright Starres, most Influent, and these all Appearing in the Circle hiemall: His Bow devided in that beaten roade, Call'd Galaxia, where the gods have troade So oft; that looke upon it in the night, When all the rest's dull, that alone shines bright: (As you now at this instant:) Hee fifteene Starres, did I say? How you then; who betweene Your landing and repose, by power divine, Have full Three-score, about your state to shine: For every Company's a Starre this day, Visible to all, and over these you sway: But twelue in chiefe; and those wee must confesse, Of greater lustere made, to guide the lesse: All enioy one like Freedome, all are Free, And all (Great PrÃ¦tor) to bee rul'd by thee: Commanding all the rest, who in thy spheare, Now rising, art to shine a compleate yeere. You may obserue his Bow still ready bent, In which there is a perfect Emblem ment Of Divine Iustice: Th'Arrow, with a Starre Headed, Implies, that her power reacheth farre; And no opposure, fraude, violence, or rape, Can (when shee aimes to strike) her vengeance scape; Yet though the string be drawne up to his eare, (As alwayes prest) hee rather seemes with feare To threat, then punish, and though hee can still Let loose his shafts, hee seldome shoots to kill. Obserue it well, the Morrall doth imply, All Iustice should be mixt with lenitie, So, Imitate the gods, since them wee know, Apt still to Mercie, but to vengeance slow: And the CÅlestiall bodies, though they trade Above, yet were for our example made. As oft as man sinnes, should Iove punnish vice, His Quiver would be emptied in a trice, And man-kind, at once perish: O mixe them Mercy with Iustice, Interweave againe Iustice with Mercy; so shall you in your state, Not Starres alone, but the gods Imitate: So shall your Terrene body, in the end, All the CÃ¦lestiall bodies farre transcend, And deckt with better lights then those you see Above the spheares, shine to eternitie. The Third Plat-forme, is contrived onely for Pastime, to please the vulgar, and therefore deserves no further Charractar, then a plaine nomination, as devised onely to please the eye, but no way to feast the eare: and so I leave it to proceede to the next. The Fourth Moddell, is a Castle munified with sundry Peeces of Ordnance; and Accomodated with all such Persons as are needfull for the defence of such a Citadell: the Gunner being ready to give fire upon all occasions; as for the curious Art in the contriving thereof, I make no question but the worke it selfe is sufficiently able to commend the Workeman, being knowne to be an excellent Artist, of which, the spectatours may best censure; I will onely deliver unto you a word or two concerning the presenter, which is Mars. Mars. Hee is styled the third amongst the gods, because hee stands in that degree amongst the Planets: and is said to be the sonne of Iupiter; some write that Bellona was his Nursse, others that she was his Mother, and some his sister. Yet none of these improper, for Ennio which is Bellona, implies no more then an incouragement of the minde to hardinesse and valour in all Skyrmishes and Battailes. He His sundry Denominations. is also cal'd Ares which signifieth Dammage or detriment, and Mavors quasi Mares vorans, of devouring of men; and by the Gentiles, had the Denomination of the god of Battailes. He was antiently figured an angry man sitting in a Chariot, armed with a sheild and other weapons, both offensiue, and defensiue. Vpon his head a plumed Helmet, his sword mounted vpon his thigh, hee held in one hand a whip, in the other, the Raines, being drawne in his Chariot by wylde and vntam'd Horses. Before him was portraied a Wolfe devouring a Lambe, the Wolfe being the beast particularly offered vpon his shrine, and because the two Romane Twinnes the first founders of Rome, Romvlvs and Remvs, were fained to be the sonnes of Mars (of which the one slewe the other) therefore Romvlvs is figured vpon his Chariot as the vnnatural survivor. The Athenians were the first that ever sacrificed to this god of Warre, which Celebration was call'd Ekaton pephomena for whosoever had slaine an Hundred of the publike Enemies, was bownd to sacrifice a man upon his Altar, situate in the Ile Lemnos, but after the bloodinesse, and inhumanitie thereof, displeasing the Athenians, they changed that custome, and in stead of a man, offered a gelded Hogge, which they call'd Nefrendes: Varro writes, that amongst the Romans, Sicinnivs Dentatvs, having fought one hundered and Ten severall Duells, and being Victor in them all, receiving Forty five wounds, whose skarres were visible upon his body, all before, and none backward: Hee was for his Valour, honoured with Twenty five severall Crownes, and received moreover, an Hundred and Forty golden Bracelets; and was the first amongst the Romanes, that ever made oblation to this Deity: Mars sitting in the front of the Tower, speakes as followeth. The Speech of Mars. Bellipotent Mars is from his spheare come downe, To heighten these brave Triumphs of Renowne, Seated in this mur'd Citadel, defenc'd A Peece goes off. With Bullets wrapt in Fire, and Cloudes condenst. The Tormentary Art, not long since found, Which shatters Towers, &amp; by which Ships are drown'd, I bring along; to let you understand These guard your safety, both by Sea, and Land. O, when I late saw from mine orbe Divine, So many Sonnes of Mars, amongst you, shine In compleat Arms, Plum'd Casks, and Ensigns spred By such brave Captaines, and Commanders led: No Souldier, but his Posture to the life, Acting to'th Musick of the Drum and Fyffe, Some practising small Bombards, some the great, Whose very thunder, rows'd mee from my feate: This Peacefull Citie, I much prays'd, whose power Could to a Campe, it selfe change in an houre: Proceed in your brave Practise; whil'st I tell Wherein your Iron and Steele doth most excell. Without these Metalls, Nature could produce Nothing that is conducefull to mans use: The Plow, without the Coulter and the Share, Could make no Furrows, and those Graines that are Vpon them throwne, were lost to them that sowe them, Without the Sickle, or the Sythe to mowe them: The Gardeners Art, would cease to be a trade, If take from him the Matocke, and the Spade. In Denns and Caves wee should be forc'd to dwell, Were there no Axes made, that Timber fell: Nor on the Seas could wee have Shipps to sayle, Without the Sawe, the Hammer, and the Nayle: Aske those that take in Angling most delight, Without the baited Hooke, no fish will bite. The Iron Crowe turnes up the Indian mould, Trenching the Earth untill they dig out Gold. If with the Iron the Adamant should contend, There should be no more Compasse, but an end Of all Discovery: Even the Horse wee ride Vnshod, would founder, who takes greatest pride, When the most curb'd, and playing with the bit, Hee snowes the ground, and doth the Spurre forgit. There is no Art, Craft, Faculty, or Trade, Without it, can subsist: Your Sword is made Of these mixt Metalls (Sir) Iustice would cease, If (as in Warre) it were not us'd in Peace: Power makes it yours, your wisedome now direct you; Whilst Peace swayes heere, Mars shall abroad protect you. The speech being ended, the Ordnance goeth off from the Castle; and now I come to the fist and last. Heere I might enter into large discourse, concerning the commodiousnesse of Iron and Steele, and to speake of Tuball Cain, who made the first Forge, and found out the vse of these Metalls: as also Vulcan the deified Smith and of his Cyclopean Hammers with which hee was said to have beaten out Ioves Thunderboults, with other fixions to the like purpose, these having before been exposed to the publick view vpon occasion of the like solemnity, &amp; knowing withall that Cibus his coctus, relisheth not the quesie stomackes of these times. I therefore purposly omit them proceeding to the last Pageants, styled Sinus salutis, first the Boosome, or harbour of Health and Happinesse. The sculpture being adorned with eight several persons, representing such vertues as are necessary to bee imbraced by all such Majestrates, who after their stormy and tempestuous progresse through all judicature causes incident to their places, seeke to anchor in that safe and secure Port so styled. Every Magistrate is a minister vnder God, appointed by his divine ordinance to that calling to be a protector of the Church, a preseruer of discipline and Peace, consonant with his lawes, the lawes of nature, and the land, which hee ought faithfully to execute, with corporall punishment, correcting the proud and disobedient, and against all unjust oppressors, defending the conformable and humble. The first vertue Fortitudo togata. adorning the structure is stiled Fortitudo togata, which gowned Fortitude is thus defined. A constancy of minde persevering in honest purpose rightly undertaken and according to his place and calling, tollerating private injuries for lawdable cause, dispising pleasures, corrupt guifts, detraction, and the like: and these meerly for vertues sake and preferring the publike good before his owne private gaine, &amp;c. Of which Fabritius was a noble president, who refusing the gold sent him by Pyrhus was no whit affrighted with the terror, of his Elephants; to speake or act any thing against the dignity of the Republicke. Of whom Eutropius reports, Pyrhus to have said: the Sunne is more easie to bee altered in his course, then this Fabritius to be removed from his honesty. Mansuetudo. Mansuetudo, or gentlenesse is a vertue mediating wrath and suppressing all desire of revenge and remitting offences, for publicke concords sake, which notably appeared in Pericles, who when one had bitterly rayled on him, for space of one whole after noone, in the open market place: night comming, hee caused his servants to light him to his house with Torches. Candor. Candor, or sincerity is when without simulation we our selues speake, and with no diffidence suspect the good meaning of others: wishing all just men well, rejoycing at theire prosperity, and commisserating their disaster: It is reported of Trajanus the Emperour, that when Sura Licinius one of the Tribunes, was accused unto him, to have Insidiated his life, not questioning the faith of so knowne a friend; the same night, un-invited, supt with him privately in his house, and the Table being with-drawne, trusted himselfe to be trim'd by Sura's Barbar. Patientia Phylosophica. Patientia Philosophica, Is a Vertue obedient unto reason, in bearing wrongs, and suffering adversities; it moderates griefe, and bridles nature, so that it never rebells against Iustice, Modesty, Constancy, or any other vertue; Xenophon ports Cyrus and Agesolanus to be of such Philosophical patience, that in their height of determination in all their actions, and speech, they appeared to all men affable, and offencelesse. Placabilitas. Placabilitie is a vertue, having corespondence with that which I before stil'd Mansuetudo, or Gentlenesse; Philosuchia, or study of Peace, and Concord, is when a Magistrate thinks Humbly of himselfe, moderating his owne anger, and bearing with the Infirmities of others, pardoning Injuries, and maintaining unitie, being provident that all unnecessary controversie bee aton'd, least the publike Peace and Vnitie of the Church, or Commonweale be disturbed, or hindred; of which Vertue, Abraham was a most Imitable President, who, though in Authoritie, Wisedome, and age, hee had, Prioritie before Lot, yet not-with-standing, gave place to him; only for Concords sake. Humanitas. Humanitie, which the Greekes call Ethos, Is Iustice, coupled with Gentlenesse, Equitie, Vpright-life, Affabilitie, and the like, for which are remark't, Alexander, Cyrus, Octavius CÃ¦sar, &amp;c. It hath also beene obserued amongst Schollars (In which number I may Catalogue your Lordship), that the more learned they have beene, they have shewed themselues the more humane, and humble. Nemesis five Zealus. The last is Nemesis, or Zeale, which is an ardent love of Gods glory, of Iustice, Pietie, Sanctitie, &amp;c. With an earnest Indignation against whatsoever is evill, supporting the Religious, and severely punishing the wicked, and refractory. Phinees zelo Inflammatus Confodit scortatorem, &amp;c. So much to Illustrate the Persons, I come now to the Speech. Hee that is call'd to bee a Majestrate, A Guide, a Ruler, or a Candidate, Must of so great a burden know the weight; But first the stepps that mount him to that height: Shall I direct you then, what sayle to beare? (Like a good Pilot) and what course to steare: (Your pardon, Great Sir) daring to descry A passage, which you better know then I. There is a double Fortitude, both Crown'd With merited Palme; one Gunn'd, the other Gown'd: The Souldier claymes the first, as his by due, The next, the Civill Sword, now borne by you: By which, as great a glory you shall win In Peace, as hee in Warre, by curbing sinne, And cherishing vertue; In the second place, Stands Gentlenesse, and Mercy, O what grace Hath Peace, with Pitty mixt? Metalls best feele, When Iron is well Incorporate with Steele: A body so calcin'd to publike use, As to support Right, and suppresse abuse: Sinceritie may chalenge the third classe, Next Patience, which by suffering, doth surpasse All other Vertues: Placability, Study of Concord, and Fidelity; Last, holy Zeale, and that doth crowne the rest: All these being harbour'd in your honour'd brest, Shall (maugre shelues and rocks) your passage cleare, And bring you to the Port, to which you steare: You are the Citties Chiefe, the Prime, the Sole, In expectation: like the stedfast Pole: Proove constant in your Course, be still the same, So let your Sword (tutch'd with Truth's Adamant) aime In your yeeres compasse, that to all mens view (Skilfull in stearage) it may still goe true: So, those that were before you, and rul'd well, Equall you shall, although not Antecell. There remaines the Speech at Night, which is onely a Sumnary, or reiteration of the former Showes, Applied to the taking leave of his Lordship, and to commend him to his rest: Mars being the Speaker. The Speech at Night. PhÅbus his Steedes hath stabled in the West, And Night (succeeding Day) inuites to rest: The three CÅlestiall Queenes, sent from above, Leaving with you their Power, their Wisdom, Love Now take their leaves: The Centaure doth bestow On you his Iustice, with his shaft, and bowe, Who to your best repose, bequeath's you heere, To mount himselfe againe unto his spheare: The Night being come, he cannot well be mist: For without him, his Orbe cannot subsist: Neither can mine: Now must my Starre display It's Luminous Rays, being borrowed thence this day, To waite upon your Triumphs, and shall still Protect you, and your weighty charge, untill Hee, which shall all your upright Actions blesse, Conduct you to your Port of Happinesse. These Frames, Modells, and Structures, were Fashioned, Wrought, and Perfected, by the Two Artists, Iohn, and Mathias Chrismas; Successors to their Father, Mr. Gerald Chrismas, late disceased, as well in the Exquisite performance of his qualititie, as in his true sinceritie, and honesty; of whom I may confidently speake, as no man could out-vie him in these Workes, which hee underwent, so none could outmatch him in his word, For any thing hee undertooke; concerning whom I make no scruple, thus Ingeniously to conclude: Ars patris, in filiis etiam, post fata viget.
