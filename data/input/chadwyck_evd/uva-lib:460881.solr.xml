      <field name="fulltext">NOTE. The Story upon which âThe Palace of Truthâ is founded is probably as old as the âArabian Nights.â âThe Princessâ is a respectful parody of Mr. Tennyson's exquisite poem. It has been generally held, I believe, that if a dramatist uses the mere outline of an existing story for dramatic purposes, he is at liberty to describe his play as âoriginal.â W. S.

      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. âCourt in King Hildebrand's Palace. King Hildebrand, discovered seated, in gloomy moodâ Florian and other Courtiers discovered looking off through telescopesâCyril standing by the King. Hilde. See you no sign of Gama? Flori. None, my liege. Hilde. It's very odd indeed! If Gama fails To put in an appearance at our court, Before the sun has set in yonder west, And fails to bring the Princess Ida hereâ To whom our son Hilarion was betrothed At the extremely early age of oneâ There's war between King Gama and ourself. (Aside to Cyril.) Oh, Cyril, how I dread this interview! It's twenty years since he and I have met. He was a twisted monsterâall awry, As though Dame Nature, angry with her work, Had crumbled it in fitful petulance! Cyril. But, sir, a twisted and ungainly trunk Often bears goodly fruitâperhaps he was A kind, well-spoken gentleman? Hilde. Oh noâ For, adder-like, his sting lay in his tongue! His bitter insolence still rankles here, Although a score of years have come and gone! His outer man, gnarled, knotted as it was, Seemed to his cruel and cynical within, Hyperion to a Saturday Review! Cyril. Oh, bear with himâhe is an old, old man. Old men are fretfulâpeevish, as we know. A worm will sometimes turnâso will the milk Of human kindness, if it's kept too long. Flori. (looking through glass). But stay, my liege; o'er yonder mountain's brow Comes a small body bearing Gama's arms; And, now I look more closely at it, sir, I see attached to it King Gama's legs; From which I gather this corollaryâ That that small body must be Gama's own! Hilde. Ha! Is the Princess with him? Flori. Well, my liege, Unless her ladyship is six feet high, And wears moustachios, too, and smokes cigars, And rides en cavalier, in coat of mail, I do not think she is. Hilde. (excited). Come, bustle there! For Gama, place the richest robes we have! For Gama, place the coarsest prison dress! For Gama, let our best spare bed be aired! For Gama, let our deepest dungeon yawn! For Gama, lay the costliest banquet out! For Gama, place cold water and dry bread! For as King Gama brings the Princess here, Or brings her not, so shall King Gama haveâ Much more than everythingâmuch less than nothing! Enter Prince Hilarion. Hilar. Well, father, is there news for me, at last? Hilde. My son, King Gama's host is now in sight: Prepare to meet the fascinating bride To whom you were betrothed so long ago. Why, how you sigh! Hilar. My liege, I'm much afraid The Princess Ida has not come with him. Hilde. And why? Hilar. I've heard she has forsworn the world, And, with a band of women, shut herself Within a lonely country house, and there Devotes herself to stern philosophies. Hilde. Then, I should say, the loss of such a wife Is one to which a reasonable man Would easily be reconciled. Hilar. Oh noâ Or I am not a reasonable man. She is my wife: has been for twenty years. Hilde. That's trueâyou were a baby in long clothes When you gained Ida's heart and she gained yours. Hilar. YesâI rememberâeach of us was won! I think I see her now! (Looking through telescope.) Hilde. Ha! let me look! Hilar. In my mind's eye, I meanâa blushing brideâ All bib and tuckerâfrill and furbelow! How exquisite she looked as she was borne Recumbent in the monthly nurse's arms! How the bride wept!ânor would be comforte Until the hireling mother-for-the-nonce Administered refreshment in the vestry. And I remember feeling much annoyed That she should weep at marrying with me; âBut then,â I thought, âthese brides are all alike! Cry on, young ladyâbrides are bound to cry. You cry at marrying me? How much more cause You'd have to cry if it were broken off!â These were my thoughtsâI kept them to myself, For, at that age, I had not learnt to speak. Hilde. Your memory is singularly good. Hilar. Do you remember, too, the wedding feastâ Rolls steeped in milk, and other softened food, Fit for our undeveloped little gums? And talk of drink, I never shall forget, How merrily we passed that nursing-bottle! A curly-headed patriarch of threeâ The Princess Ida's uncleâthen proposed The happy couple's healthâthe bridesmaids then, Fifteen in number, each six weeks of age, Began to weepâthe fifteen groomsmen, too (The eldest of them eighteen months or so), Wept alsoâthen, remembering they were men, Dashed from their eyes the unaccustomed brine! We parted thenâand since, for twenty years, We have not met. It seems quite strange that she Should have become a woman in the while! She speaks a hundred languages, I'm told. Hilde. Your late mamma had mastered only one, Yet she was never at a loss for words! Hilar. But think how useful is a wife who can Express her fancies in a hundred tongues. Hilde. You will find one, of average length, enough. Hilar. I've heard she hopes to make all women swear That they'll abjure, for aye, the tyrant Man! She's far before the age in which she lives! Hilde. At all events she's singular in that, Most grown-up ladies of our court give out That they are several years behind their age! Hilar. A woman thus endowed should have been born A century hence, at least! Hilde. The day will come When you will most devoutly wish she had. Enter Cyril. Cyril. My liege, King Gama's train is at the gate And prays admission. Hilde. Cyril, show him in. Though Princess Ida wore a Gorgon's head, He shall not tamper with King Hildebrand! FlourishâProcession. Enter Cyril, Florian and Court, ushering King Gama, and one Attendant. Gama. So this is Castle Hildebrand?âwell, wellâ Dame Rumour whispered that the place was grand; She told me that your taste was exquisiteâ Superbâunparalleledâ Hilde. Oh, really, kingâ Gama. But she's a liar! Why, how old you've grown! Is this Hilarion?âwhy, you've changed, too! You were a singularly handsome child! (To Cyril.) Are you a courtier? Come, then, ply your trade! Tell me some lies: how do you like your king? Vile Rumour says he's all but imbecileâ Now that's not true! Cyril. My lord, we love our king: His wise remarks are valued by his court As precious stones. Gama. And for the self-same cause! Like precious stones the wit of Hildebrand Derives its value from its scarcity! Come now, be honest, tell the truth for once, Tell it of me! Come, come, I'll harm you not! This leg is crookedâthis foot is ill-designedâ This shoulder wears a humpâcome, out with it! Look, here's my faceânow am I not the worst Of Nature's blunders? Hilar. Nature never errs; To those who know the workings of your mind, Your face and figure, sir, suggest a book Appropriately bound. Gama. Why, harkye, sir! How dare you bandy words with me? Hilar. No need To bandy aught that appertains to you. Gama (to Hildebrand). Do you permit this, king? Hilde. We are in doubt Whether to treat you as an honoured guest, Or as a traitor knave who plights his word And breaks it! Gama. If the casting vote's with me I give it for the former. Hilde. We shall see: By the terms of our contract, signed and sealed, You're bound to-day to bring the Princess here To join her spouse. Why is she not with you? Gama. Why? Come, I'll tell you, if you'll answer this: What think you of a wealthy purse-proud man Who, when he calls upon a starving friend, Pulls out his gold, and flourishes his notes, And flashes diamonds in the pauper's eyesâ What name have you for such an one? Hilde. A snob! Gama. Just so: King Hildebrand, I am no snob. The girl has beauty, virtue, learning, wit, Grace, humour, wisdom, charity, and pluck. Would it be kindly, think you, to parade These brilliant qualities before your eyes? Oh no, King Hildebrand, I am no snob! Hilde. But hang it, man, the contract that we signed Some twenty years agoâ Gama. Why, here's good news! (To Court.) At last your king is going to redeem His lengthy list of broken promisesâ And very properly, as wise men should, Begin at the beginning! Hilde. Stop that tongue, Or you shall lose the monkey head that holds it! Oh, I'll be even with you, yet, for this. Gama. Bravo! Your king deprives me of my head, That he and I may meet on equal terms! Hilde. Of this anonâwe'll try the force of armsâ Where is she now? Gama. In Castle Adamantâ One of my many country houses. There She rules a woman's University, With full five hundred girls who learn of her. Cyril. Five hundred girls! Five hundred ecstasies! Gama. But no mere girls, my good young gentleman! With all the college learning that you boast, The youngest there will prove a match for you! Cyril. With all my heart, if she's the prettiest! Fancyâfive hundred matchesâall alight! That's if I strike them, as I hope to do. Gama. Despair your hopeâtheir hearts are dead to man. He who desires to gain their favour must Be qualified to strike their teeming brains, And not their hearts! They're safety-matches, sir, And they light only on the knowledge box, So you've no chance! Hilar. We'll try, at all events. I'll take no soldiers, father, in my trainâ Cyril and Florian here will go with me, And we will storm them ere the week is out. Gama. That's brave! They're only womenâstorm away! Hilar. Oh, don't mistake us, sir; we mean to storm Their eyes and hearts, and not their citadel. With sigh we'll charge our mines and counter-mines, Dance steps shall be our scaling ladders, with Those croquet mallets for our battering rams. Fair flowers shall bear the only blades we wield, Our eyes shall be our very deadliest darts, And bon-bon crackers our artillery! Gama. And so you think to conquer them with sighs? My good young gentleman, a sigh, to them, Is simply an exceptionally marked Contraction of the intercostal muscles! Croquet is interesting only when It illustrates familiar theories Of incidental and reflecting angles. Fair flowers, to them, are mere embodiments Of calyx, pistil, stamina, and petal. Expressive eyes would have their charm, no doubtâ Hilar. Of course! Gama. But only, be it understood, As illustrating theories of vision! But here are lettersâtake them if you likeâ Perhaps she's tired of disobedience, And may admit you. Hilde. Good: Hilarion, go; Take Florian and Cyril, as you say. King Gama, we detain you pris'ner here, As hostage for the safety of our son. Gama. A prisoner? Why, what should I do here At Castle Hildebrand? I am not mad! Hilde. You can amuse yourself by fancying That there's an execution in our house, And you're the party in possessionâor That we are dead and you've succeeded us. In short, suppose whatever state of things Would offer you the greatest happiness. Gama (to Hilarion). You run a risk, my friend; so take good heed, For no one knows her temper but myself: (To King.) Since her betrothal, king, until the day When she abjured all male society, I was the only man she ever saw! Hilar. Oh, that explains the mystery at once, And simplifies our taskâcome, Florian, And we will show these maidens what they've lost. [Exeunt Hilarion, Florian, and Cyril.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. âThe Gates of Castle Adamant. Enter Gobbo, with ladies' robes on his arm. Gobbo. More robes for undergraduates! I suppose Some students are expected here to-day. No girl without a robe may pass those gates! They are so proud of these here caps and gowns, They hardly like to take 'em off a-night! They even wear (or so I've heard it said) Night-caps and night-gowns when they go to bed! [Exit into porter's lodge. Enter Hilarion, Cyril, and Florian. Hilar. So, here's the Princess Ida's castle? Well, They must be lovely girls if it requires Such walls as these to keep intruders off! Cyril. To keep men off is only half their charge, And that the easier half. I much suspect The object of these walls is not so much To keep men off as keep the maidens in! Hilar. Here lives the porter, Cyril. I'll be bound He's quite as learned as the rest of them, Half Newton and half Bacon! Here he comes. Enter Gobbo from lodge. Cyril. Half Bacon? No,âall Bacon, I should say! Gobbo. Now then, what is it? Hilar. I'm a royal prince; These gentlemen are followers of mine; We hold King Gama's letters, charging you To bear us safely to the Council Hall, In which the Princess Ida holds her state. Gobbo. Ho! ho! ho! ho! Hilar. How now?âyou mock at us? (Draws sword.) Gobbo. Mock you? Why, bless your heart and soul alive, No man may place his foot within those walls; It's death to disobey our Princess, sir! Flori. It's double death to disobey your king! (Draws.) Cyril. It's treble death to disobey ourselves! (Draws.) Gobbo. But, sirs, I am the only man alive Who ever enters! Flori. You? Gobbo. Yes! Once a year I am led through their ranks that they may see What sort of thing's a man! âSee here!â she cries. âSeeâthis is what you lose in losing man! This is a courtly knightâwell born, well formed!â (I'm comely, sirs; but, bless you, I'm no knight!) âLook, girls,â she cries, âthis is a courtly knightâ A type of all that's beautiful in man!â (Aloud.) And then they make me gibber, squeak, and mow; Then, with much deference and mock courtesy, They bow me to my duty at the gate! Flor. Are there no males whatever in those walls? Gobbo. None, gentlemen, excepting letter mails! And they are driven (as males often are In other large communities)âby women! If you'll believe me, gentlemen, I swear, She's so confoundedly particular, She'll scarcely suffer Dr. Watts's hymns; And all the animals she owns are âhersâ! The ladies rise at cockcrow every mornâ Hilar. Oh, then they have male poultry! Gobbo. Not at all. (Confidentially.) The crowing's done by an accomplished hen! Cyril. And what are these? (Looking at robes in lodge.) Gobbo. The academic robes, Worn by the lady undergraduates When they matriculate. Hilar. I'll try one on. (Does so.) Why, seeâI'm covered to the very toes! Ha! I've a proposition! Flori. State it, then. Hilar. Suppose we dress ourselves as girls, and claim Admission to this University? It is a thing we've often done at home In amateur theatricals. You know How well I play viragos in burlesque! Flori. My Cleopatra, tooâremember that! Cyril. My Mrs. Bouncer, too, in âBox and Coxâ! Hilar. Wilt play the woman, then? Cyril. Of course! What knight Would hesitate to âtake a woman's partâ? Quartette.âHilarion, Cyril, Florian, and Gobbo, as they dress themselves in women's clothes. âLes Trois Cousinesâ (La PÃ©richole). Flori. If we are hailed with any query, Say we are nice young ladies, three; Who of the world terribly weary, Enter a University. Such lovely girls, ha, ha, ha ha! All. Such lovely girls, ha, ha, ha, ha! Cyril. We will declare to them that lately, We have been bored with suitors stately, And we prefer young ladies greatlyâ Sorry to say that that's too true! All. Sorry to say that that's too true! Hilar. We must take care when we are talking, Never our manly tastes to show; Hold up our dresses thus in walking, Showing an inch of ankleâso! All. Showing an inch of ankleâso! Such lovely girls, ha, ha, ha, ha! Such lovely girls, ha, ha, ha, ha! Gobbo (in terror). But, gentlemen, observeâif you do this, What's to become of me? Hilar. I do not know What will become of you if we do this; But I can read the fate in store for you If you presume to interfere with us. Now, porter, say to whom we should apply To gain admission. Gobbo (in tears). Why, to Lady Blanche Or Lady Psyche. Flori. Which is prettier? Gobbo. Well, I like Lady Blanche by far the best. Flori. Then we declare for Lady Blanche at once, Gobbo. You see, she's more my ageâthe other one Is young and pretty! (Contemptuously.) Cyril. Bah! Then I retract; We will be Psyche's interesting charge! So go and summon her. (Gobbo rings, and then exit.) Flori. But stop a bit, What will your father think of such a scheme? Cyril. Oh, he beâdashed! Hilar. Extremely shocked I am! Cyril. I meant my sireâ Hilar. I thought you meant your âdamâ! Enter Lady Psyche from gate, attended. Psyche. Who summons us? Hilar. Three would-be students, ma'amâ Three noble ladies, ma'am, of good estate, Who wish to join this University. (They curtsey.) Psyche. If, as you say, you wish to join our ranks, And will conform with all our rules, 'tis well; But understandâyou must adapt yourselves To all the regulations now in force, In Princess Ida's University. Hilar. To all its rules we cheerfully subscribe. Flori. (aside to Hilarion). Here's a catastrophe, Hilarion! This is my sister! She'll remember me, Though years have passed since she and I have met! Hilar. No matter, hide your faceâshe'll know you not. Psyche. You say you're noblewomenâwell, you'll find No sham degrees for noblewomen, hereâ Or other cruel contrivances to draw An arbitrary line 'twixt rich and poor. No butteries, or other institutes, To make poor students feed rich cooksâno tufts To mark nobility; except such tufts As indicate nobility of brain. As to your fellow-students, mark me wellâ There are five hundred maidens in these walls All good, all learned, and all beautiful. You must select your intimates from these; They are prepared to love you; will you swear You'll do your best to love them in return? Flori. Upon our words and honours, ma'am, we will! Psyche. And will you swear that if, by any chance, You're thrown into a man's society, You'll not allow your thoughts to stray from us, But, at the earliest opportunity, You'll give up his society for ours? Cyril. All this, dear madam, cheerfully we swear. Psyche. But we go further: will you undertake That you will never marry any man? Flori. Indeed we never will! Psyche. Consider well,â You must prefer our maids to all mankind! Hilar. To all mankind we much prefer your maids! Cyril. We should be dolts, indeed, if we did not, Seeing how fairâ Hilar. (aside to Cyril). Take care, that's rather strong! (Aloud.) We have seen men of wealthâay, princes, tooâ Whose beauty has been so remarkable, That half the maidens in our monarch's court Have pined away and died for love of them! These menâApollos in their manly grace, Indeed in everything (except in that They wore a proper quantity of clothes)â We think of with profound indifference, But, when we see a woman who excels In virtue, scholarship, and loveliness, We long to lay our heads upon her breast, And join our lives with hers! Psyche. Why, that's well said; But have you left no lovers at your home, Who may pursue you here? Hilar. No, madam, noneâ We're homely ladies, as no doubt you see, And we have never fished for lover's loveâ We smile at girls who deck themselves with gems, False hair, and meretricious ornaments, To chain the fleeting fancy of a man; But do not imitate them. What we have Of hair is all our ownâour colour, too, Unladylike, but not unwomanly, Is but the glow of rugged, boisterous health; Our gait, untrammelled by the influence Of high-heeled boots, small waists, and Grecian bends, May seem undignifiedâbut then we walk As Nature meant us toâand man has learnt To reckon Nature an impertinence! Psyche. I know how coldly men regard a girl, Whose beauty is her poorest excellence; But beauty goes for nothing in these walls. You'll find yourselves appreciated here: If what you say is true, you'll spend with us A happy, happy time! Cyril. If, as you say, Five hundred lovely maidens wait within To welcome us with smiles and open arms, I think there's very little doubt we shall! [Exeunt into Castle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Third. âGrounds of Castle Adamant; Waterfall and Stream, crossed by rustic bridge; Girl-Students discovered grouped about the stage, occupied with philosophical instruments, etc. Ada. I shall be quite alone, dear, in my rooms, So come and spend a long, long eveningâdo! And bring your steam-engine! Chloe. Oh, that I will! And you shall show me all your nice new thingsâ That quadrantâand the anemometer; And oh, that darling, darling dumpy-level I've heard so much about! Lydia. My love, I see You've got another new theodolite. (Aside to Chloe.) That's the fifteenth this month! The one I used Went out of fashion half a year ago! Oh, I've a bit of scandal! What d'you think? Melissa found a billet-doux, concealed In that Egyptian mummy we unrolled Last night. Just think of that! Enter Melissa, from bridge, running. Melissa. I say, my dear, I have such news for you! I've just been shown The robe for doctors of divinity. Oh, it's the sweetest thing!âMagenta silk, Trimmed with chinchilla, bouillonnÃ© behind, Gored to the figure, though; and on the skirt, Two rows of Cluny lace as deep as that! Chloe. Oh my! how lovely! Melissa. Then the trencher cap Is amber satin, trimmed with Cluny lace And rows of pearls; and round the outer edge The tiniest, tiniest rosebuds in the world! Ada (to Chloe). It's much more lovely than the legal gownâ Green grenadine, with rÃ»chings down the front, That we shall wear. Chloe (pouting). I shall give up the law And go into the church! I've always felt A serious longing for a parson's life; Besides, I'm dark, and look a fright in green! Sacha. Take care, here's Lady Blanche. How stern she looks! Enter Lady Blanche, L. Girls study vigorously. Blanche. Attention, ladies, while I read to you The Princess Ida's list of punishments: The first is Sacharissa. She's expelled. All. Expelled! Blanche. Expelledâbecause, although she knew No man of any kind may see these halls, She dared to bring a set of chessmen here! Sacha. (in tears). I meant no harmâthey're only men of wood! Blanche. They're men with whom you give each other mateâ And that's enough! The next is Sylviaâ Sylvia. Oh! Blanche. Sylvia is rusticated for a month Because, in spite of all our college rules Upon the point, she dared to put three rows Of lace insertion round her graduate's gown! Phyllis will lose three terms, for yesterday, When, looking through her drawing-book, I found A sketch of a perambulator! All (shocked). Oh! Blanche. Double perambulator, shameless girl! That's all at present. Now, attention, please; Your principal, the Princess, comes to give Her usual inaugural address, To those young ladies who joined yesterday. March.âEnter the Princess, over bridge, attended by eight âdaughters of the plough.â (All curtsey profoundly.) Princess. Women of Adamantâfair neophytes, Who pant for the instruction we can give, Attend, while I unfold a parable: The elephant is stronger than the man, Yet man subdues him. Why? The elephant Is elephantine everywhere but here (tapping forehead). And Man, whose brain is to the elephant's As Woman's brain to Man'sâthat's rule of threeâ Conquers the foolish giant of the woods, As Woman, in her turn, shall conquer Man. In mathematics Woman leads the way! The narrow-minded pedant still believes That two and two make four! Why, we can proveâ We women, household drudges as we areâ That two and two make fiveâor threeâor sevenâ Or five and twenty, as the case demands! Finance? Why, I've heard clever men declare, Their bankers' balance being overdrawn, They don't know where to turn for ready cash, Yet wilfully ignoring all the while That remedy unfailingâdraw a cheque! Diplomacy? The wily diplomate Is absolutely helpless in our hands: He wheedless monarchsâWoman wheedles him! Logic? Why, tyrant man himself admits It's waste of time to argue with a woman! Then we excel in social qualitiesâ Though man professes that he holds our sex In utter scorn, I'll undertake to say, If you could read the secrets of his heart, He'd rather be alone with one of you Than with five hundred of his fellow-men! In all things we excel. Believing this, Five hundred maidens here have sworn to place Their foot upon his neck. If we succeed, We'll treat him better than he treated us; But if we failâoh, then let hope fail too! Let no one care one penny how she looks! Let red be worn with yellowâblue with green, Crimson with scarletâviolet with blue! Let all your things misfit, and you yourselves At inconvenient moments come undone! Let hair-pins lose their virtue; let the hook Disdain the fascination of the eye,â The bashful button modestly evade The soft embraces of the button-hole! Let old associations all dissolve, Let Swan secede from EdgarâGrant from Gask, Sewell from CrossâLewis from Allenbyâ In other words, let Chaos come again! Who lectures in the Upper Hall to-day? Blanche. I, madam, on Abstract Philosophy. There, I propose considering at length Three pointsâthe Is, the Might Be, and the Must. Whether the Is, from being actual fact, Is more important than the vague Might Be, Or the Might Be, from taking wider scope, Is, for that reason, greater than the Is, And lastly, how the Is and Might Be stand Compared with the inevitable Must. Prin. The subject's deepâhow do you treat it, pray? Blanche. Madam, I take three Possibilities, And strike a balance then between the three, As thusâthe Princess Ida Is our headâ The Lady Psyche Might BeâLady Blancheâ Neglected Blancheâinevitably Must. Given these three hypothesesâto find The actual betting against each of them! Come, girls! [Exeunt Lady Blanche and Students. Prin. (looking after her). Ambitious fool. And do you think you can Provide this college with a head? Go, go! Provide yourself with oneâyou want it more! Enter Lady Psyche, over bridge, conducting Hilarion, Florian, and Cyril. Lady P. Here is the Princess Ida's favourite grove, And here's the Princess. (To Princess.) These are ladies three Who join our College. Hilar. (aside to Cyril). Gods! how beautiful! Prin. What special study do you seek, my friend? Hilar. (enraptured). Madam, I come that I may learn to live, For, if I come not here, I die! Prin. (laughing). Indeed? Your case is desperate! We welcome you. We meet at luncheonâuntil then, farewell! [Exit Princess. Flori. (aside to Hilarion). When Psyche sees my face, I'm confident She'll recognize her brother Florian. Let's make a virtue of necessity, And trust our secret to her gentle care. (Hilarion assents.) (Aloud) Psyche! Why, don't you know meâFlorian? (Psyche amazed.) Psyche. Why, Florian! Flori. My sister! Psyche. Oh, my dear, What are you doing hereâand who are these? Hilar. I am that Prince Hilarion to whom Your Princess is betrothedâI come to claim Her promised loveâyour brother Florian, here, And Cyrilâcome to see me safely through. Psyche. The Prince Hilarion!âCyril too! How strange! My earliest playfellows! Hilar. (astonished). Why, let me look! Are you that learned little Psyche who At school alarmed her mates because she called A buttercup âranunculus bulbosusâ? Cyril. Are you indeed that Lady Psyche, who At children's parties drove the conjuror wild, Explaining all his tricks before he did them? Hilar. Are you that learned little Psyche, who At dinner parties brought into dessert Would tackle visitors with âyou don't know Who first determined longitudeâI doâ Hipparchus 'twas, B. C. one sixty three!â Are you indeed that little Psyche, then? Psyche. That small phenomenon in truth am I! But, gentlemen, 'tis death to enter hereâ My vow will make me speak. What shall I do? This palace is a rat-trapâwe the baitâ And you the foolish victims! Cyril. Be it soâ A prisoned rat, before he dies the death, Has liberty to nibble at the bait! (Kisses her.) Psyche. Forbear, sirâprayâyou know not what you do! We have all promised to renounce mankind. Hilar. But on what grounds do you, fair Psyche, base This senseless resolution? Psyche. Senseless? No! It's based upon the grand hypothesis, That as the Ape is undeveloped Man So Man is undeveloped Woman. Hilar. Then, This, of all others, is the place for us! Enter Melissa unperceived, at back; she listens in astonishment. If Man is only undeveloped Woman, We men, if we work very hard indeed, And do our utmost to improve ourselvesâ May in good time be woman! Though I own Up to this point (as far as I'm aware) The metamorphosis has not commenced. Melissa (coming down). Oh, Lady Psyche!â Psyche (startled). Whatâyou heard us, then? Oh, all is lost! Melissa. Not so; I'll breathe no word. (Advancing in astonishment to Florian.) How marvellously strange! And are you then, Indeed, young men? Flori. Well, yesâjust now we are; But hope, by dint of study, to become, In course of time, young women! Melissa (eagerly). No! no! no! Oh, don't do that! Is this indeed a man? I've often heard of them, but till this day Never set eyes on one. They told me men Were hideous, idiotic, and deformed! They're quite as beautiful as women are! (Patting Florian's cheek.) Their cheeks have not that pulpy softness which One gets so weary of in womankind! Their features are more marked,âand oh! their chinsâ (feeling his chin) How curious! Flori. I fear it's rather rough. Melissa. Oh, don't apologizeâI like it so! But I forgot; my mother, Lady Blanche, Is comingâand her eyes are very keenâ She will detect you, sir! Hilar. Oh, never fear! We saw her ladyship an hour ago; She seemed to have suspicions of our sex, And showed us robes, and gave us needlework, As though to test us. Well, we did the work Like seamstressesâand named the various stuffs, As if we'd spent a full apprenticeship At Swan and Edgar's! Enter Lady Blanche. Exeunt the three Gentlemen with Lady Psyche. Blanche (aside to Melissa). Here, Melissaâhush! Those are the three new students? Melissa (confused). Yes, they areâ They're charming girls! Blanche (sarcastically). Particularly so! So graceful, and so very womanly; So skilled in all a girl's accomplishments! Melissa (confused). Yes, very skilled! Blanche. You stupid little fool! Awhile ago, I placed before their eyes Some Cluny laceâthey called it Valenciennesâ Hemming is stitchingâso at least they sayâ A gusset is a goreâa tuck's a flounceâ Merino's cottonâlinen's calicoâ Poplin is silk, and rep is corduroy! I bade them hem a pocket handkerchiefâ They placed their thimbles on their forefingers! And set about their work as clumsily As if they had been men, in girls' disguise! Melissa (trembling). You surely wrong them, Mother dear, for seeâ(picking up a case from floor) Here is an Ã©tui dropped by one of themâ Containing scissors, needles, andâ Blanche (taking it from her, and opening it). Cigars!!! Why, these are men! And you knew this, you cat! Melissa. Oh, spare themâthey are gentlemen, indeed, The Prince Hilarionâbetrothed long since To Princess Idaâwith two trusted friends! Consider, Mother, he's her husband now! And has been, twenty years! Consider, too (insidiously), You're only second hereâyou should be firstâ Assist the Prince's plan, and when he gains The Princess Ida's hand, you will be first! You will design the fashionsâthink of that! And always serve out all the punishments! The scheme is harmless, Motherâwink at it Blanche. The prospect's tempting! Well, well, well, I'll tryâ Though I've not winked at anything for years! 'Tis but one step towards my destinyâ The mighty Must! Inevitable Shall! [Exit Lady Blanche. Melissa. Saved for a while, at least! Enter Florian. Flori. Melissa here? Melissa. Oh, sir, you must away from this at once, My Mother guessed your sexâit was my fault; I blushed and stammered so, that she exclaimed: âCan these be men?â (then seeing this) âWhy, theseââ âAre men!â she would have added, but âare menâ Stuck in her throat! She keeps your secret, sir, For reasons of her own; but fly from this, And take me with youâthat isâno, not that! Flori. I'll goâbut not without you. (Bell.) Why, what's that? Melissa. The luncheon bell. Flori. I'll wait for luncheon, then. See, here's Hilarion with the stern Princess, And Cyril with my sister Psyche, too. Enter Cyril with Psyche, and Hilarion with Princess, Lady Blanche, also all the other Girls, over bridge, bearing luncheon, which is spread. They all sit down and eat, Cyril drinking freely. Prin. You say you know the Court of Hildebrand? There is a prince thereâI forget his name. Hilar. Hilarion? Prin. Exactly. Is he well? Hilar. If it is well to droop and pine and mopeâ To sigh, âOh, Ida! Ida!â all day longâ âIda! my love! my life! Oh, come to me!ââ If it is well, I say, to do all this, Then Prince Hilarion is very well. Prin. He breathes our name? Well, it's a common one! And is the booby comely? Hilar. Pretty well. I've heard it said that if I dressed myself In Prince Hilarion's clothes (supposing this Consorted with my maiden modesty), I might be taken for Hilarion's self, But what is this to you or me, who think Of all mankind with unconcealed contempt? Prin. Contempt? Why, damsel, when I think of man, Contempt is not the word! Cyril (getting tipsy). I'm sure of that; Or, if it is, it surely should not be! Hilar. (to Cyril). Be quiet, idiot, or they'll find us out! Cyril. The Prince Hilarion's a goodly lad! Prin. You know him, then? Cyril. I rather think I do! We were inseparables. Prin. Why, what's this? You loved him, then? (horrified). Cyril. We didâand doâall three! And he loves us sincerely in return! Hilar. (confused). Madam, she jestsâ(aside to Cyril) Remember where you are! Cyril. Jests? Not at allâwhy, bless my heart alive, You and Hilarion, when at the Court, Rode the same horse! Prin. Astride? Cyril. Of courseâwhy not? Wore the same clothesâand once or twice, I think, Got tipsy in the same good company! Prin. Well, these are nice young ladies, on my wordâ Cyril (to Florian). Don't you remember that old laughing song, That he and we would troll in unison, At the Three Pigeonsâjust when daylight broke? I'll give it you! Song, Cyril; AirâLaughing Song from âManon Lescaut.â A young and earnest reader, Once with a special pleader, Was reading for the bar, Ha! ha! ha! ha! A budding luminary, Particularly wary, As lovers often are, Ha! ha! ha! ha! He met a lady bright, ha! ha! 'Twas very late at night, ha! ha! There shone no moon nor star, Ha! ha! ha! ha! Her head lay on his shoulder, And what d'you think he told her?â You'll never guess, I know. I scarcely like to tell you, For fear it should repel youâ Come, whisper, whisper low! No! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! They threaded many mazes, Of buttercups and daisies, They wandered very far, Ha! ha! ha! ha! So amiable he found her, He put his arms around her, And she opposed no bar, Ha! ha! ha! ha! He squeezed her little fin, ha! ha! He chucked her little chin, ha! ha! And christened her his star, Ha! ha! ha! ha! Her head lay on his shoulder, And what d'you think he told her?â You'll never guess, I know. I'll hazard it and tell you, Although it may repel youâ Come, whisper, whisper low! No! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! (After song he lights a cigarette.) Prin. Infamous creatureâget you hence away! Hilar. Dog! Here is something more to sing about! (Strikes him.) Cyril (sobered). Hilarionâare you mad? Prin. (astonished). Hilarion? Help! Why, these are men! Lost! Lost! betrayed! undone! (Running on to bridge.) Girls get you henceâman-monsters, if you dare Approach one stepâIâah! (loses balance and falls). Psyche. Oh! save her, sir! Blanche. It's useless, sir; you'll only catch your death. (Hilarion springs in.) Sacha. He catches herâ Melissa. And now he lets her goâ Again she's in his graspâ Psyche. And now she's not! He seizes her back hairâ Blanche. And it comes off! Psyche. Noânoâshe's saved! She's saved! She's saved! She's saved! (Hilarion is seen swimming with the Princess in one armâhe swims to a bank and the Princess and he are brought to land.) Prin. You've saved our lives and so have saved your own, But leave this palaceâmen in women's clothes! Enter Lydia, running. Why, what's the matter now? Lydia. King Hildebrand, Holding your father captive, sends to say That if Hilarion suffers any harm, Your father's life will pay the penalty; Moreoverâif you do not yield yourself, According to the tenor of your oath, He will attack you ere to-morrow's dawnâ And force compliance! Prin. Will he so, indeed? We'll teach these men a lesson. (To Hilarion.) Get you gone! You saved our livesâwe thank you for itâgo! Arm, Amazons! We'll show these gentlemen How nobly Woman vindicates her claim To equal individuality! Arm! Arm! This is our opportunity. The three Gentlemen are thrust forth by the Amazons. Tableau.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fourth. âHildebrand's Camp before Ida's Castle. Enter Hildebrand and Gama. Hilde. The Princess Ida still holds out, although Our camp is fairly pitched before her walls. King Gama, if Hilarion comes not back All safe and sound, you'll surely suffer death! Your head for his! Gama. The stakes are poorly matched: It's Lombard Street against a China orange! Hilde. In the mean time, pray make yourself at home, Direct my army as it were your own. On every matter that concerns the state, Your orders give;âthey will not be obeyed, But that don't matter! Gama. Don't it? Hilde. Not a jot! The ecstasy of absolute command Is seriously dashed when you reflect, That for all consequences that ensue, You by the world are held responsible! But here, where all are bound to hear your word With every outward token of respect, They systematically disobey it, Your power of high command is just as great, The consequences absolutely nil. Enter Atho. Atho. My liege, three gentlemen await without, Attended by a troop of soldiery. (Gives note.) Gama (reads). âThe Princes Arac, Guron, Scynthius, King Gama's sons, desire that you will set Their father free.â (To Atho.) Admit these gentlemen. [Exit Atho My sons! That's brave! Enter Arac, Scynthius, and Guron. Hilde. What would you, gentlemen? Arac. What would we? Why, look you, King Hildebrandâ You hold our father in unkingly bonds, Our sister you beleaguer in her home, You threaten to lay waste our richest lands, And then you coolly ask us, âWhat would we?â Guron. We come to claim our father at your hands. Scynthius. We come to save our sister Ida from The rude assault of savage soldiery. Why, they are girlsâmere girlsâand should be stormed As other girls are stormed, if stormed at all! Hilde. As other girls are stormed so shall they be; We'll use no cannon, bayonet, or sword, For such ungentlemanly argumentsâ Convincing though they beâwould but convince These women 'gainst their will! We'll witch them forth With love songs, odes, and idle fripperies, Such as a woman cannot long withstand. Stay, you shall seeâ Enter Atho. Atho. All is prepared, my liege, To storm the wallsâ Hilde. Then let the siege commence! Enter First Officer. Who leads the serenading party, eh? First Officer. Sir Michael Costa. Hilde. Good! the light guitars Fall in at sixâthe King's own baritones, Led by Sir Santley. First Officer. He's not knighted, sir! Hilde. He shall be, then. They will parade at five. [Exit First Officer. Enter Second Officer. Second Officer. Who leads the scaling party, sir? Hilde. Of course The first light tenors; they can highest go. [Exit Second Officer. Atho. And who shall first climb up the outer wall, And reconnoitre what goes on within? Hilde. Some tenor, fool, who can âgo up to see!â [Exit Atho. Let all be furnished with their photographs, And scatter them among these Amazons. Bid the director of the poets direct And post five hundred valentines, and see They get them by to-night's delivery. Go, tell the gallant lady, who commands The horse brigade of royal milliners, To place five hundred toilet tables out Within full view of Princess Ida's walls. Upon them place five hundred mirrors; then Lay out five hundred robes of French design; And if they still hold out they're more than women! [Exeunt Officers, Gama, Arac, Scynthius, and Guron. King. If all this fails, I have a deadlier scheme: Five hundred waltzing bachelorsâtried men, Who can waltz forwardsâbackwardsâanyhowâ Shall twirl and twist before their dazzled eyes, Thrumming soft music on a light guitar.

Oh, tickle their vanity; Oh, never be chary, Oh, flatter your fairy, Ever unwary, Tickle it, ah! Bravo bravissimo, Generalissimo. Serve her it, ah! Flatter her beauty, With an acute eye, Say it's your duty, Call her a star! Sneer at another, Coddle her mother, Butter her brother, Ever so far! La, la, la, la!

Take her and marry her, Worry her, harry her; Oh, you may carry her Ever so far! Just like a teetotum With a guitar! Enter Atho. Atho. My liege, I bring good news: your plan succeeds. Three ladies of the Princess Ida's band Are coming towards your camp. Hilde. The mirrors did it! Admit them. Enter Hilarion, Cyril, and Florian, still in women's clothes. WhyâHilarion! Cyril too! And Florian! dressed as women. Ho! ho! ho! (All jeer them.) Hilar. We gained admission to fair Ida's halls By this disguise. We were detected, though, And should have suffered death, but that she knew, In killing us, she killed her father too! Gama (in high glee). Here, set me free! Hilarion safe againâ Is this indeed Hilarion? Hilar. Yes, it is. Gama. Why, you look handsome in your women's clothes. Stick to 'emâman's attire becomes you not! (To Florian and Cyril.) And you, young ladies, will you please to pray King Hildebrand to set me free again? Hang on his neck and gaze into his eyes, Bring all your woman's wiles to bear on him. He never could resist a pretty face! Cyril. You dog! Though I wear woman's garb, you'll find My sword is long and sharp. Gama. Hush, pretty one! Here's a virago! Here's a termagant! If length and sharpness go for anything, You'll want no sword while you can wag your tongue. Flori. What need to talk of swords to such as he? He's old and crippled. (To Gama.) Oh, if you were young, And tolerably straightâand I could catch You all alone, I'dâAh! Gama (bashfully). Oh, go along, You naughty girlâwhy, I'm a married man! But I've three sonsâsee, ladiesâhere they areâ Fine fellowsâyoung and muscular and brave. They'll meet you, if you will. Come, what d'ye say? Arac. Ay, pretty ones, engage yourselves with us, If three rude warriors who have spent their lives Hacking at enemies, affright you not! Hilar. (to Gama). Old as you are, I'd wring your shrivelled neck If you were not the Princess Ida's father. Gama. If I were not the Princess Ida's father, And so had not her brothers for my sons, No doubt you'd wring my neckâin safety too! Hilar. Enough! I speak for Florian and Cyril. Arac, we take your challengeâthree to threeâ So that it's understood that Ida's hand Depends upon the issue. Arac. There's my hand; If she consents notâsister though she be We'll raze her castle to the very ground! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. âInner Gate of Castle Adamant. All the Lady Students discoveredâthe eight Servants as Amazonsâthe others all around. FlourishâEnter Princess Ida, followed by Lady Blanche. Prin. Is all prepared for war? We have to meet Stern bearded warriors in fight to-day. Wear nought but what is necessary to Preserve your dignity before their eyes, And give your limbs full play. Blanche. One moment, ma'am: Here is a paradox we should not pass Without inquiry. We are prone to say, âThis thing is Needfulâthat Superfluousââ Yet they invariably co-exist! We find the Needful comprehended in The circle of the grand Superfluous; While the Superfluous cannot be bought Unless you're amply furnished with the Needful. These singular considerations areâ Prin. Superfluous, yet not Needfulâso, you see, These terms may independently exist. Women of Adamant, we have to show These men how they have underrated us. Now is the time to prove our titles to The highest honours they monopolize. Now is the time to prove our theory That woman, educated to the work, Can meet man face to face on his own ground, And beat him there. Now let us set to work! Where is our lady surgeon? Sacha. Madam, here! Prin. We shall require your skill to heal the wounds Of those that fall. Sacha. What! heal the wounded? Prin. Yes! Sacha. And cut off real live legs and arms? Prin. Of course! Sacha. I wouldn't do it for a thousand pounds! Prin. Why, how is this? Are you faint-hearted, girl? You've often cut them off in theory. Sacha. In theory I'll cut them off again With pleasure, and as often as you likeâ But not in practice! Prin. Coward, get you hence! I've craft enough for that, and courage too. I'll do your work! My Amazons, advance! Why, you are armed with spearsâmere gilded toys! Where are your muskets, pray? Ada. Why, please you, ma'am, We left them in the armoury, for fear That, in the heat and turmoil of the fight, They might go off. Prin. âThey might!â Oh, craven souls, Go off yourselves! Thank Heaven, I have a heart That quails not at the thought of meeting men. I will discharge your muskets. Off with you! Where's my bandmistress? Chloe. Please you, ma'am, the band Do not feel well, and can't come out to-day! Prin. Why, this is flat rebellion! I've no time To talk to them just now! But happily I can play several instruments at once, And I will drown the shrieks of those that fall With trumpet music such as soldiers love. How stand we with respect to gunpowder? My Lady Psycheâyou who superintend The lab'ratory, where your class compounds That hideous chemicalâare you prepared To blow these bearded rascals into shreds? Psyche. Why, madamâ Prin. Well? Psyche. Let us try gentler meansâ Treat them with the contempt that they deserve. We can dispense with fulminating grains, While we have eyes with which to flash our rage. We can dispense with villainous saltpetre, While we have tongues with which to blow them up. We can dispense, in short, with all the arts That brutalize the practical polemist. Prin. (contemptuously). I never knew a more dispensing chemist! Away! away! I'll meet these men alone, For all my women have deserted me! Enter Melissa. Melissa. Madam, your brothers crave an audience. Prin. My brothers? Why, what do they here? Melissa. They come To fight for you. Prin. Admit them! Blanche. Infamous! One's brothers, ma'am, are men! Prin. So I have heard; But all my women seem to fail me when I need them most: in this perplexity Even one's brothers may be turned to use. Enter Arac, Guron, and Scynthius. Arac. My sisters! Prin. Arac, Guron, Scynthius, too! (They embrace.) Arac. We have arranged that Prince Hilarion And his two followers shall fight us here; And if we fall, we've promised him your hand. Prin. (sighing). So be it, Arac; brothers though you be, With all your faults you're brave, as brutes are brave. So be itâfight them here, but (aside and bashfully) oh, my brother, Kill whom you will, but spare Hilarion! He saved my life! Melissa (aside to Arac). Oh, save me Florian, He is her brother! (indicating Pysche). Psyche (aside to Arac). Oh, spare Cyril, sir, You've no idea what jolly songs he sings! Arac. Bah! I can spare them allâI want them not! But here they come: stand back, the lists prepareâ Get you within those walls, poor trembling ones, And see that no one interferes with us. Enter Hilarion, Cyril, and Florian, with Kings Gama and HildebrandâPrincess and Ladies retire within outer wall, and group themselves on battlements. Gama. Come, boys, we've all prepared; begin! begin! Why, you lack mettle!âGad, I'll spur you up! (To Arac.) Look, Aracâthere's the son of that vile king, Who, when he held me as his prisoner, Tormented me with tortures worse than death. I hadn't anything to grumble at! He found out what particular meats I loved, And gave me themâthe very choicest wineâ The costliest robesâthe richest rooms were mine. He suffered none to thwart my simplest plan, And gave strict orders none should contradict me. He made my life a curse! Go in at them! Avenge your father's wrongs! (To Hilarion.) And as for youâ (Pointing to his sons) Here are three princes, sirs, who stand between You and your happinessâso cut them down! Give them no mercy, they will give you none Come, Prince Hilarion, begin, begin! You've this advantage over warriors Who kill their country's enemies for pay, You know what you are fighting forâlook there! (Pointing to Ladies on battlements.) Hilar. Come on! Arac. Come on! Cyril. Come on! Scyn. Come on! Flori. Come on! (Desperate fightâat the end, Hilarion, Cyril, and Florian wound Arac, Guron, and Scynthius. Prin. (entering through gate). Hold! stay your hands!âwe yield ourselves to you. Ladies, my brothers all lie bleeding there! Bind up their woundsâbut look the other way. Is this the end? How say you, Lady Blancheâ Can I with dignity my post resign? And if I do, will you then take my place? Blanche. To answer this, it's meet that we consult The great Potential Mysteries; I mean The five Subjunctive Possibilitiesâ The May, the Might, the Would, the Could, the Should. Can you resign? The Prince Might claim you; if He Might, you Couldâand if you Should, I Would! Prin. I thought as much. Then to my fate I yieldâ So ends my cherished scheme! Oh, I had hoped To band all women with my maiden throng, And make them all abjure tyrannic Man! Hilde. A noble aim! Prin. You ridicule it now; But if I carried out this glorious scheme, At my exalted name Posterity Would bow in gratitude! Hilde. But pray reflectâ If you enlist all women in your cause, And make them all abjure tyrannic Man, The obvious question then arises, âHow Is this Posterity to be provided?â Prin. I never thought of that! My Lady Blanche, How do you solve the riddle? Blanche. Don't ask meâ Abstract Philosophy won't answer it. Take himâhe is your Shall. Give in to Fate! Prin. And you desert me! I alone am staunch! Hilar. Madam, you placed your trust in womanâwell, Woman has failed you utterlyâtry man, Give him one chance, it's only fairâbesides, Women are far too precious, too divine To try unproven theories upon. Experiments, the proverb says, are made On humble subjectsâtry our grosser clay, And mould it as you will! Cyril. Remember, too, Dear Madam, if at any time you feel Aweary of the Prince, you can return To Castle Adamant, and rule your girls As heretofore, you know. Prin. And shall I find The Lady Psyche here? Psyche. If Cyril, ma'am, Does not behave himself, I think you will. Prin. And you, Melissa, shall I find you here? Melissa. Madam, however Florian turns out, Unhesitatingly I answer, No. Gama. Consider this, my love: if your mamma Had looked on matters from your point of view (I wish she had), why, where would you have been? Lady B. There's an unbounded field of speculation, On which I could discourse for hours! Prin. No doubt! We will not trouble you. Hilarion, I have been wrongâI see my error now. Take me, HilarionââWe will walk the world Yoked in all exercise of noble end! And so through those dark gates across the wild That no man knows! Indeed, I love theeâCome!â Finale, from âLe Pont des Soupirs.â Cyril. Singers know How sweetly at a piano A tenor and soprano Together sound. Chorus. Singers know, etc. Hilar. This will show That men and women verily Can get along more merrily Together bound. Chorus. This will show That men and women verily Can get along more merrily Together bound! Together bound! Together bound!</field>
