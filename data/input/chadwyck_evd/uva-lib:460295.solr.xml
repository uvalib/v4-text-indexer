      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Peisthetairus,âAn Athenian citizen, but disgusted with his own country, starts on his travels proposing to seek his fortune in the kingdom of the Birds. He is represented as the essential man of business and ability, the true political adventurer; the man who directs every thing and every body; who is never in the wrong, never at a loss, never at rest, never satisfied with what has been done by others, uniformly successful in his operations. He maintains a constant ascendancy, or if he loses it for a moment, recovers it immediately. Euelpides,âA simple easy-minded droll companion, his natural follower and adherent; as the Merry Andrew is of the Mountebank. It will be seen, that like the Merry Andrew, he interposes his buffoonish comments on the grand oration delivered by his master. Epops,âKing of the Birds; formerly Tereus King of Thrace, but long ago, according to the records of mythology, transformed into a Hoopoe. He appears as the courteous dignified sovereign of a primitive uncivilized race, whom he is desirous to improve: he gives a gracious reception to strangers arriving from a country more advanced in civilization; and adopts the projects of aggrandizement suggested to him by Peisthetairus. The Chorus of Birds, his subjects, retain on the contrary, their hereditary hatred and suspicion of the human race; they are ready to break out into open mutiny against their king, and to massacre his foreign (human) advisers upon the spot. It is with the greatest difficulty, that they can be prevailed upon to hear reason, and attend to the luminous exposition of Peisthetairus. His harangue has the effect of conciliating and convincing them; his projects are adopted without a dissentient voice. War is not immediately declared against the gods, but a sort of Mexican blockade is established by proclamation. Prometheus,âA malcontent deity, the ancient patron of the human race, still retaining a concealed attachment to the deposed dynasty of Saturn. He comes over secretly with intelligence which Peisthetairus avails himself of, and which proves ultimately decisive of the subjugation of the gods. Neptune, Hercules, Triballus, or the Triballian, Joint ambassadors from the gods, commissioned to treat with Peisthetairus. Neptune is represented as a formal dignified personage of the old school. Hercules as a passionate, wrong-headed, greedy blockhead: he is cajoled and gained over by Peisthetairus; and in his turn intimidates the Triballian, an ignorant barbarian deity, who is hardly able to speak intelligibly. They join together, Neptune is out-voted, and Peisthetairus concludes a treaty by which his highest pretensions are realized. The characters abovementioned are the only ones who contribute in any way to the progress of the drama; the remainder, a very amusing set of persons, are introduced in detached scenes, exemplifying the various interruptions and annoyances incident to the man of business, distracting his attention and embarrassing him in the exercise of his authoritative functions. There are however exceptions. Iris, who is brought in, having been captured and detained for an infringement of the blockade. A Priest who comes to sacrifice at the inauguration of the new city. Two Messengers arriving from different quarters, with very interesting and satisfactory intelligence. The rest are a mere series of intruders on the time and attention of the great man. Poet,âA ragged vagabond, who comes begging with an inaugural ode on the foundation of the new city. A Soothsayer, arriving with oracles relative to the same important event, and a demand of perquisites due to himself by divine authority. Meton,âThe Astronomer, proposes to make a plan and survey of the new city. A Commissioner from Athens, a very authoritative personage. A Vender of copies of decrees: he enters reading them aloud, like a hawker to attract purchasers. Parricide,âA young man who has beaten his father, and proposes to strangle him, offers himself as a desirable acquisition to the new colony. Kinesias, the dithyrambic poet, applies for a pair of wings. Informer,âA young man whose hereditary trade is that of an informer, and whose practice extends to the Islands, comes with the same application.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE. [A wild desolate country with a bare open prospect on one side, and some upright rocks covered with shrubs and brushwood in the centre of the stage. Peisthetairus and Euelpides appear as a couple of worn-out pedestrian travellers, the one with a Raven and the other with a Jackdaw on his hand:â they appear to be seeking for a direction from the motions and signals made to them by the Birds. Eu. â[speaking to his Jackdaw.] Right on do ye say? to the tree there in the distance? Peis. â[speaking first to his Raven, and then to his companion.] Plague take ye!âWhy this creature calls us back! Eu. âWhat use can it answer tramping up and down? We're lost I tell ye: our journey's come to nothing. Peis. âTo think of me travelling a thousand stadia With a Raven for my adviser! Eu. âThink of me too, Going at the instigation of a Jackdaw, To wear my toes and my toe-nails to pieces! Peis. âI don't know even the country, where we've got to. Eu. âAnd yet you expect to find a country here, A country for yourself! Peis. âTruly not I; Not even Execestides He is attacked again in this play, as a foreign barbarian arrogating to himself the privileges of a true-born Athenian. could do it, That finds himself a native every where. Eu. âOh dear! We're come to ruin, utter ruin! Peis. âThen go that way cant' ye: âthe Road to Ruin!â Eu. âHe has brought us to a fine pass, that crazy fellow Philocrates the poulterer; he pretended To enable us to find where Tereus lives; The King that was, the Hoopoe that is now; Persuading us to buy these creatures of him, That Raven there for three-pence,âand this other, This little Tharrelides Tharrelides was nicknamed Jackdaw, and Euelpides in contempt of his Jackdaw calls it a Tharrelides! The Raven and the Jackdaw are characteristic. Peisthetairus is the bearer of the sagacious bird, his companion is equipped with a Jackdaw. of a Jackdaw,â He charged a penny for: but neither of 'em Are fit for any thing but to bite and scratch. [speaking to his Jackdaw.] Well, what are ye after now?âgaping and poking! You've brought us straight to the rock. Where would you take us? There's no road here! Peis. âNo, none, not even a path. Eu. âNor don't your Raven tell us any thing? Peis. âShe's altered somehowâshe croaks differently. Eu. âBut which way does she point? What does she say? Peis. âSay? Why she says, she'll bite my fingers off. Eu. âWell truly it's hard upon us, hard indeed, To go with our own carcasses to the crows, And not be able to find 'em after all. [turning to the audience.] Peisthetairus, it will be seen, allows his companion to put himself forward, with the newly discovered natives; remaining himself in the back ground as the person of authority, making use of the other as his harbinger; he allows him also to address the audience, not choosing to compromise himself by unnecessary communications. The full and complete account of their motives and design is moreover much better suited to the careless gossiping character of Euelpides. For our design, most excellent spectators, (Our passion, our disease, or what you will,) Is the reverse of that which Sacas Acestor, a tragical poet, not being a genuine Athenian was called Sakas from the name of a Thracian tribe. feels; For he, though not a native, strives perforce To make himself a citizen: whilst we, Known and acknowledg'd as Athenians born, (Not hustled off, nor otherwise compell'd) Have deem'd it fitting to betake ourselves We may suppose that Peisthetairus must have accompanied this speech with a grave authoritative gesture indicative of assent and approbation. To these our legs, and make our person scarce. Not through disgust or hatred or disdain Of our illustrious birth-place, which we deem Glorious and free; with equal laws ordain'd For fine and forfeiture and confiscation With taxes universally diffus'd; And suits and pleas abounding in the Courts. For grasshoppers sit only for a mouth Chirping upon the twigs; but our Athenians Sit chirping and discussing all the year, Perch'd upon points of evidence and law. Therefore we trudge upon our present travels, With these our sacrificial implements, To seek some easier unlitigious place; Meaning to settle there and colonize. Our present errand is in search of Tereus, (The Hoopoe that is now) to learn from him If in his expeditions, flights, and journies, He ever chanc'd to light on such a spot. Peis. âHolloh! Eu. âWhat's that? Peis. âMy Raven here points upwards. âDecidedly! Eu. âAy, and here's my Jackdaw too, Gaping as if she saw something above.â Yes,âI'll be bound for it; this must be the place: We'll make a noise, and know the truth of it. Peis. âThen âkick against the rock.â âTo kick against the rockâ was proverbial. Eu. âKnock you your head Against the rock!âand make it a double knock! Peis. âThen fling a stone at it! Eu. âWith all my heart, Holloh there! Peis. âWhat do you mean with your Holloh? You should cry Hoop for a Hoopoe. Eu. âWell then Hoop! Hoop and holloh, there!âHoopoe, Hoopoe I say! Tr. âWhat's here? Who's bawling there? Who wants my master? [The door is opened, and both parties start at seeing each other.] Eu. âOh mercy mighty Apollo! what a beak! Tr. âOut! out upon it! a brace of bird-catchers! Eu. âNo, no; don't be disturb'd; think better of us. Tr. âYou'll both be put to death. Eu. âBut we're not men. Tr. âNot men! what are ye? what do ye call yourselves? Eu. âThe fright has turn'd me into a yellow-hammer. Tr. âPoh! Stuff and nonsense! Eu. âI can prove it to ye. Search! Tr. âBut your comrade here; What bird is he? Peis. âI'm chang'd to a Golden Pheasant just at present. Eu. âNow tell me in heaven's name; what creature are ye? Tr. âI'm a slave bird. Eu. âA slave? how did it happen? Were you made prisoner by a fighting cock? Tr. âNo. When my master made himself a Hoopoe, He begg'd me to turn bird to attend upon him. Eu. âDo birds then want attendance? Tr. âYes of course, In his case, having been a man before, He longs occasionally for human diet, His old Athenian fare: pilchards for instance. Then I must fetch the pilchards; sometimes porridge; He calls for porridge, and I mix it for him. Eu. âWell you're a dapper waiter, a didapper; But didapper, I say, do step within there, And call your master out. The Trochilus has been unnecessarily communicative, and shewn himself a very simple sort of a Sewingman; Eu. has tact enough to discover this, and assumes the ascendancy accordingly. Tr. âBut just at present He's taking a little rest after his luncheon, Some myrtle berries and a dish of worms. Eu. âNo matter call him here. We wish to speak to him. Tr. âHe'll not be pleas'd I'm sure; but notwithstanding, In the tone of Simple, Master Slender's serving man. Since you desire it, I'll make bold to call him. [Exit Peis. â[looking after him.] Confound ye I say, you've frighten'd me to death. Eu. âHe has scar'd away my Jackdaw; it's flown away. Peis. âYou let it go yourself, you coward. Eu. âTell me, Have not you let your Raven go? Peis. âNot I. Eu. âWhere is it then? Peis. âFlown off of it's own accord. Eu. âYou did not let it go! you're a brave fellow! [The Hoopoe from within] Hoo. âOpen the door I say; let me go forth. [The Royal Hoopoe appears with a tremendous beak and crest] Eu. âOh Hercules what a creature! What a plumage! And a triple tier of crests; what can it be! Hoo. âWho call'd? who wanted me? Eu. âMay the heavenly powers..! ... Confound ye I say. [aside] Hoo. âYou mock at me perhaps. Seeing these plumes.âBut, stranger, you must knowâ That once I was a man. Eu. âWe did not laugh At you, Sir. Hoo. âWhat then were you laughing at? Eu. âOnly that beak of yours seem'd rather odd. Hoo. âIt was your poet Sophocles In his tragedy of Tereus, Sophocles had represented him as transformed (probably only in the last scenes) with the head and beak of a bird. that reduc'd me To this condition with his tragedies. Eu. âWhat are you Tereus? Are you a bird, or what? Hoo. âA Bird. Eu. âThen where are all your feathers? Hoo. âGone. Eu. âIn consequence of an illness? Hoo. âNo the Birds At this time of the year leave off their feathers, But you! What are ye? Tell me. Eu. âMortal men. Hoo. âWhat countrymen? Eu. âOf the country of the Triremes. Gallies with three banks of oars. The Athenians were at that time undisputed masters of the sea. Hoo. âJurymen I suppose? Eu. âQuite the reverse, We're anti-jurymen. Hoo. âDoes that breed still Continue amongst you? Eu. âSome few specimens The love of litigation and the passion for sitting on Juries, with the exception of a few who retained their old agricultural habits, had infected the whole Athenian community. You'll meet with, here and there, in country places. Hoo. âAnd what has brought you here? What was your object? Eu. âWe wish'd to advise with you. Hoo. âWith me! For what? Eu. âBecause you were a man: the same as us; And found yourself in debt: the same as us; And did not like to pay: the same as us; And after that, you chang'd into a bird; And ever since have flown and wander'd far Over the lands and seas, and have acquir'd All knowledge that a bird or man can learn. Therefore we come as suppliants, to beseech Your favor and advice to point us out Some comfortable country close and snug, A country like a blanket or a rug, Where we might fairly fold ourselves to rest. Hoo. âDo you wish then for a greater state than Athens? Eu. âNot greater; but more suitable for us. Hoo. âIt's clear you're fond of aristocracy. Eu. âWhat him, the son of Scellias! Aristocrates? Little or nothing is known of Aristocrates. He lived to the end of the war, and acted in concert with Thrasybulus against Critias. Dem. in Timoc. I abhor him. Hoo. âWell what kind of a town would suit ye? Eu. âWhy, such a kind of town as this for instance, A town where the importunities and troubles Are of this sort. Suppose a neighbour calls Betimes in the morning with a sudden summons: âNow don't forget,â says he, âfor heaven's sake, âTo come to me to-morrow, bring your friends âChildren and all, we've wedding cheer at home. âCome early, mind ye, and if you fail me now, âDon't let me see your face, when I'm in trouble.â Hoo. âSo, you're resolv'd to encounter all these hardships! [to Peisthetairus] And what say you? Peis. âMy fancy's much the same. Hoo. âHow so? Peis. âTo find a place of the same sort; A kind of place, where a good jolly father Meets, and attacks me thusââWhat's come to ye âWith my young people? You don't take to 'em. âWhat! they're not reckon'd ugly! You might treat 'em, âAs an old friend, with a little attention surely, âAnd take a trifling civil freedom with 'em.â Hoo. âAy! You're in love I see with difficulties And miseries.âWell there's a city in fact Much of this sort; one that I think might suit ye, Near the Red Sea. Eu. âNo, no! not near the sea! A humourous blunder. The Red Sea was in fact as inaccessible to antient European navigation, as the Caspian. Lest I should have the Salaminian galley The Salaminian galley had been sent to arrest Alcibiades, then one of the joint commanders in Sicily. This was one of the most fatal acts of that popular insanity which it was the poet's object to mitigate and counteract. Arriving some fine morning, with a summons Sent after me, and a poursuivant to arrest me. But could not you tell us of some Grecian city? Hoo. âWhy there's in Elis there, the town of Lepreum. Eu. âNo, no! No Lepreums: nor no lepers neither. No leprosies for me. Melanthius A tragic poet said to have been leprous, ridiculed elsewhere by the author, and by other comic poets, as Plato and Callias. Has given me a disgust for leprosies. Hoo. âThen there's Opuntius in the land of Locris. Eu. âOpuntius? Me to be like Opuntius! Nothing is recorded of Opuntius, except that he was reckoned a poltroon, and was blind of one eye. With his one eye! Not for a thousand drachmas. But tell me among the birds here, how do ye find it? What kind of an existence? Hoo. âPretty fair; Not much amiss. Time passes smoothly enough; And money is out of the question. We do n't use it. Eu. âYou've freed yourselves from a great load of dross. Hoo. âWe've our field sports. We spend our idle mornings With banqueting and collations in the gardens, With poppy seeds and myrtle. Eu. âSo your time Is past like a perpetual wedding-day. [Peisthetairus, who has hitherto felt his way by putting Euelpides forward, and allowing him to take the lead; and who has paid no attention to this trifling inconclusive conversation, breaks out as from a profound reflective reverie.] Peis. âHah! What a power is here! What opportunities! If I could only advise you. I see it all! The means for an infinite empire and command! Hoo. âAnd what would you have us do? What's your advice? Peis. âDo? What would I have ye do? Why first of all Don't flutter and hurry about all open-mouth'd, In that undignified way. With us for instance, At home, we should cry out âWhat creature's that?â And Teleas would be the first to answer: âA mere poor creature, a weak restless animal, âA silly bird, that's neither here nor there.â The lines between inverted commas may be understood either as the words of Teleas or as a description of him; the ambiguity exists in the original and is evidently intentional. It is continued in the next line of the Hoopoe's answer. Hoo. âYes Teleas might say so. It would be like him. But tell me, what would you have us do? Peis. â[emphatically] Concentrate!â âBring all your birds together. Build a city. Hoo. âThe birds! How could we build a city? Where? Peis. âNonsense. You can't be serious. What a question! Look down. Hoo. âI do. Peis. âLook up now. Hoo. âSo I do. Peis. âNow turn your neck round. See in the Knights a similar instance of ridiculous stage effect, where the Sausage-seller is mounted on his stool to survey the Athenian Empire. Hoo. âI should sprain it though. Peis. âCome, what d'ye see? Hoo. âThe clouds and sky;âthat's all. Peis. âWell, that we call the Pole and the Atmosphere; And would it not serve you birds for a Metropole? Hoo. âPole? Is it call'd a pole? Peis. âYes that's the name. Philosophers of late call it the pole; Because it wheels and rolls itself about As it were, in a kind of a roly-poly way. The comic poets ridiculed the new prevailing passion for astronomical and physical science. See further on the Parabasis and the scene where Meton the astronomer is introduced. Well, there then, you may build and fortify, And call it your Metropolis,âyour Acropolis. From that position you'll command mankind, And keep them in utter thorough subjugation: Just as you do the grasshoppers and locusts. And if the gods offend you, you'll blockade 'em, And starve 'em to a surrender. Hoo. âIn what way? Peis. âWhy thus. Your atmosphere is plac'd you see, In a middle point, just betwixt earth and heaven. A case of the same kind occurs with us. Our people in Athens, if they send to Delphi With deputations, offerings, or what not, Are forc'd to obtain a pass from the BÅotians: âThus when mankind on earth are sacrificing, If you should find the gods grown mutinous And insubordinate, you could intercept All their supplies of sacrificial smoke. Hoo. âBy the earth and all it's springs! springes and nooses! The Hoopoes exclamation and oath are in the original, as they are here represented, exactly in the style of Bob Acres! Odds, nets and snares! This is the cleverest notion: And I could find it in my heart to venture; If the other Birds agree to the proposal. Peis. âBut who must state it to them? Hoo. âYou yourself, They'll understand ye, I found them mere barbarians, But living here a length of time amongst them, I have taught them to converse and speak correctly. The characteristic impertinence of a predominant people, considering their own language as that which ought to be universally spoken. Peis. âHow will you summon them? Hoo. âThat's easy enough; I'll just step into the thicket here hard by, And call my nightingale. She'll summon them. And when they hear her voice, I promise you You'll see them all come running here pell mell. A female performer on the flute, a great favorite of the public and with the poet, after a long absence from Athens engaged to perform in this play, which was exhibited with an unusual recklessness of expense. Peis. âMy dearest best of Birds! don't lose a moment, I beg, but go directly into the thicket; Nay, don't stand here, go call your nightingale. [Exit Hoopoe. Song from behind the scene, supposed to be sung by the Hoopoe. Awake! awake! Sleep no more my gentle mate! With your tiny tawny bill, Wake the tuneful echo shrill, On vale or hill; Or in her airy rocky seat, Let her listen and repeat The tender ditty that you tell, The sad lament, The dire event, To luckless Itys that befel. Thence the strain Shall rise again, And soar amain, Up to the lofty palace gate; Where mighty Apollo sits in state; In Jove's abode, with his ivory lyre, Hymning aloud to the heavenly quire. While all the gods shall join with thee In a celestial symphony. [A solo on the flute supposed to be the nightingale's call.] Peis. âOh Jupiter! the dear delicious bird! With what a lovely tone she swells and falls, Sweetening the wilderness with delicate air. Eu. âHist! Peis. âWhat? Eu. âBe quiet can't ye? Peis. âWhat's the matter? Eu. âThe Hoopoe is just preparing for a song. Hoo. âHoop! hoop! Come in a troop, Come at a call, One and all, Birds of a feather, All together. Birds of an humble gentle bill Smooth and shrill, Dieted on seeds and grain, Rioting on the furrow'd plain, Pecking, hopping, Picking, popping, Among the barley newly sown. Birds of bolder louder tone, Lodging in the shrubs and bushes, Mavises and Thrushes, On the summer berries brouzing, On the garden fruits carouzing, All the grubs and vermin smouzing. You that in an humbler station, With an active occupation, Haunt the lowly watery mead, Warring against the native breed, The gnats and flies, your enemies; In the level marshy plain Of Marathon, pursued and slain. You that in a squadron driving From the seas are seen arriving, With the Cormorants and Mews Haste to land and hear the news! All the feather'd airy nation, Birds of every size and station, Are conven'd in convocation. For an envoy queer and shrew'd Means to address the multitude, And submit to their decision A surprising proposition, For the welfare of the state. Come in a flurry With a hurry scurry Hurry to the meeting and attend to the debate. The first appearance of the Chorus must have been a critical point for the success of a play. The audience had been brought into good humour by their favorite musical performer, by whom all the preceding songs were probably executed; for the dialogue on the stage passes solely between Peisthetairus and Euelpides, and the Hoopoe, who is supposed to sing, does not appear. The Chorus now appears, and in the original, forty lines follow, in which Peisthetairus and Euelpides act as showmen to the exhibition of 24 figures, dressed in imitation of the plumage of as many different kinds of birds, See what is said in p. 10 of the profuse expense bestowed on the exhibition of this play. which are passed in review with suitable remarks as they successively take their places in the orchestra. This passage is here omitted. Whoever wishes to see how well it can be executed, may be referred to Mr Cary's translation. While the Birds are bustling about in their new coop of the orchestra, Euelpides contemplates them with surprise, which soon changes to alarm. The language of the Birds consists almost wholly of short syllables, the effect of which it is impossible to imitate in English. Some accents, which are added, may serve to mark the attempt: they are added also to two spondaic lines, of which the imitation is more practicable. Eu. âHow they thicken, how they muster, How they clutter how they cluster! Now they ramble here and thither, Now they scramble altogether. What a fidgeting and clattering! What a twittering and chattering, Don't they mean to threaten us? What think ye? Peis. âYes, methinks they do. Eu. âThey're gaping with an angry look against us both. Peis. âIt's very true. Cho. âWhere is He, the MÃ gistrate that assÃ¨mbled us to deliberate. Hoo. âFriends and comrades here am I, your old associate and ally. Cho. âWhat have ye to commÃ¹nicate for the bÃ¨nefit of the stÃ te. Hoo. âA proposal safe and useful, practicable, profitable, Two projectors are arriv'd here, politicians shrewd and able. Cho. âWhee! Whaw! Where? Where? What? What? What? What? What? Hoo. âI repeat itâhuman Envoys are arrived a steady pair, To disclose without reserve a most stupendous huge affair. Cho. âChief, of all that ever were, the worst the most unhappy one! Speak, explain! Hoo. âDon't be alarm'd! Chorus. âAlas! Alas! what have you done? Hoo. âI've receiv'd a pair of strangers, who desir'd to settle here. Cho. âHave you risk'd so rash an act? Hoo. âI've done it, and I persevere. Cho. âBut, where are they? Hoo. âNear beside you; near as I am; very near. Cho. âOÃ¹t alÃ s! oÃ¹t alÃ s! We are betrÃ y'd, crÃ¹elly betray'd To a calÃ mitous end, Our cÃ²mrade and our friÃ¨nd, Our compÃ nion in the fiÃ¨lds and in the pÃ stures Is the aÃ¹thor of all our mÃ¬series and dÃ¬sasters. Our Ã ncient sÃ cred lÃ ws and sÃ²lemn OÃ th! TrÃ nsgrÃ¨ssing bÃ²th! TrÃ¨asonably delÃ¬vering us as a prÃ¬ze To our hÃ²rrible immemÃ²rial enemiÃ¨s, To a detÃ©stable rÃ ce ExÃ©crably base! For the Bird our Chief, hereafter he must answer to the State; With respect to these intruders, I propose, without debate, On the spot to tear and hack them. Eu. âThere it is, our death and ruin! Ah, the fault was all your own, you know it; it was all your doing; You that brought me here; and why? Peis. âBecause I wanted an attendant. Eu. âHere to close my life in tears. Peis. âNo that's a foolish fear depend on't. Eu. âWhy a foolish fear? Peis. âConsider; when you're left without an eye, It's impossible in nature; how could you contrive to cry? Cho. âForm in rank, Form in rank; Then move forward and outflank: Let me see them overpower'd, Hack'd, demolish'd and devour'd, Neither earth, nor sea, nor sky, Nor woody fastnesses on high, Shall protect them if they fly. Where's the Captain? What detains him? What prevents us to proceed? On the right there, call the Captain! Let him form his troop and lead. Eu. âThere it is, where can I fly? Peis. âSirrah be quiet, wait a bit. Eu. âWhat to be devour'd amongst them! Peis. âWill your legs or will your wit Serve to escape them? Eu. âI can't tell. Peis. âBut I can tell; Do as you're bid; Fight we must; You see the pot, just there before ye; Take the lid, And present it for a shield; the spit will serve you for a spear; With it you may scare them off, or spike them if they venture near. Eu. âWhat can I find to guard my eyes? Peis. âWhy there's the very thing you wish, Two vizard helmets ready made, the cullender and skimming dish. Eu. âWhat a clever capital lucky device, sudden and new! Nicias Nicias was at this time in the chief command of the Sicilian expedition. Alcibiades having been recalled. See note to p. 12. with all his tactics, is a simpleton to you. Cho. âSteady Birds! present your beaks! in double time, charge and attack, Pounce upon them, smash the potlid, clapperclaw them, tear and hack Hoo. âTell me most unworthy creatures, scandal of the feather'd race; Must I see my friends and kinsmen massacred before my face? Cho. âWhat do you propose to spare them? where will your forbearance cease, Hesitating to destroy destructive creatures such as these? Hoo. âEnemies they might have been; but here they come, with fair design, With proposals of advice, for your advantage and for mine. Cho. âEnemies time out of mind! they that have spilt our fathers' blood, How should they be friends of ours, or give us counsel for our good? Hoo. âFriendship is a poor adviser; politicians deep and wise Many times are forc'd to learn a lesson from their enemies; Diligent and wary conduct is the method soon or late Which an adversary teaches; whilst a friend or intimate Trains us on to sloth and ease, to ready confidence; to rest In a careless acquiescence; to believe and hope the best. Look on earth! The vast changes and improvement in the practice and the art of war which took place about this time were a subject of general speculation and remark. The concise allusions in the text, are therefore somewhat enlarged in the translation. behold the nations, all in emulation vying, Active all, with busy science engineering, fortifying; To defend their hearths and homes, with patriotic industry, Fencing every city round with massy walls of masonry: Tactical devices old they modify with new design; Arms offensive and defensive to perfection they refine; Gallies are equipt and arm'd, and armies train'd to discipline. Look to life, in every part; in all they practise, all they know; Every nation has deriv'd its best instruction from the foe. Cho. âWe're agreed to grant a hearing; if an enemy can teach Any thing that's wise or useful; let him prove it in his speech. Peis. â[aside] Let's retire a pace or two; You see the change in their behaviour. Hoo. âSimple justice I require, and I request it as a favor. Cho. âFaith and equity require it, and the nation hitherto Never has refus'd to take direction and advice from you. Peis. [aside] âThey're relenting by degrees; Recover arms and stand at ease. Cho.- Back to the rear! resume your station, Ground your wrath and indignation! Sheath your fury! stand at ease! While I proceed to question these: What design has brought them here? Hoh there Hoopoe! can't he hear? Thirteen lines, which unaccompanied by the action on the stage would appear tiresome and unmeaning, are here omitted from 387 to 400. Hoo.- What's your question? Chorus. âWho are these? Hoo.- Strangers from the land of Greece. Cho.- What design has brought them thence? What's their errand or pretence? Hoo.- They come here simply with a view To settle and reside with you; Here to remain and here to live. Cho.- What is the reason that they give? Hoo.- A project marvellous and strange Cho.- Will it account for such a change, Coming here so vast a distance? Does he look for our assistance To serve a friend or harm a foe? Hoo.- Mighty plans he has to shew (Hinted and propos'd in brief) For a power beyond belief; Ocean, earth, he says, and air, All creation every where, Every thing that's here or there, An empire and supremacy Over all beneath the sky, Is attainable by you, Your just dominion and your due. Cho.- Tell us, was he fool or mad? Hoo.- No believe me; grave and sad. Cho.- Did his reasons and replies Mark him as discreet and wise? Hoo.- With a force, a depth, a reach Of judgement; a command of speech; An invention, a facility, An address, a volubility, More than could be thought believable; 'Tis a varlet inconceivable! Cho.- Let us hear him! let us hear him! Bid him begin! for rais'd on high Our airy fancy soars: and I Am rapt in hope; ready to fly. The King Hoopoe now gives some orders in a pacific spirit, directing that all warlike weapons be removed and hung up at the back of the chimney as before. He then calls upon Peisthetairus to communicate to the assembled commonalty the propositions which had been before discussed in private conference between themselves. Peisthetairus however sees his advantage and insists upon the previous conclusion of a formal treaty of peace: this is done, and the Chorus swear to it (relapsing for a moment into their real character) âas they hope to win the prize by an unanimous vote.â But if they should fail they imprecate upon themselves the penalty of (gaining the prize notwithstanding but) âgaining it only by a casting vote.ââPeace is proclaimed, the armament is dissolved by proclamation, and the Chorus recommenced singing. [to the Chorus] Hoo.- Here you, take these same arms, in the name of Heaven, And hang them quietly in the chimney corner [turning to Peisthetairus] And You communicate your scheme, exhibiting Your proofs and calculationsâthe discourse Which they were call'd to attend to. Peis. âNo not I! By Jove; unless they agree to an armistice; Such as the little poor baboon our neighbour, The sword cutler, concluded with his wife; That they shan't bite me, or take unfair advantage In any way. Cho. âWe won't. Peis. âWell, swear it then! Cho.- We swear; by our hope of gaining the first prize, With the general approval and consent, Of the whole audience, and of all the judgesâ And if we fail; may the reproach befall us, Of gaining it, only by the casting vote. It should seem that the success of this play must have been a subject of more than usual anxiety both to the Poet himself, and to the Choregus The wealthy citizen charged with the expense and management of a theatrical entertainment. and his friends: we may conceive it to have been intended as a sedative to the mind of the commonalty, excited, as they were at the time, almost to madness by the suspicion of a conspiracy against the religion and laws of the country; a suspicion originating in a profane outrage secretly perpetrated, to a great extent, in mere insolence and wantonness, by some young men of family. In the opinion however of the Athenian people, the offence was viewed in a very serious light, as the result of an extensive secret combination, (on the part of persons bound and engaged to each other by their common participation in the guilt of sacrilege), preparatory to other attempts still more criminal and dangerous. In this state of things, and while the popular fury and jealousy upon religious subjects was at its height, the Poet ventured to produce this play; in which it will be seen, that the burlesque of the national Mythology, is carried higher and continued longer, than in any of his other existing plays.âThe confident hopes expressed by the Chorus were not realized; the first prize was assigned to a play the title of which the ComastÃ¦ or Drunken Rioters, seems to imply that its chief interest must have been derived from direct allusions to the outrage abovementioned, and to the individuals suspected to have been engaged in it. But we must return to the Herald dismissing the troops. Her.- Hear ye good people all! the troop are order'd, To take their arms within doors; and consult On the report and entry to be made Upon our journal of this day's proceedings. Cho.- Since time began The race of man Has ever been deceitful faithless ever. Yet may our fears be vain! Speak therefore and explain: If in this realm of ours, Your clearer intellect searching and clever, Has notic'd means or powers Unknown and undetected, In unambitious indolence neglected. Guide and assist our ignorant endeavor: You for your willing aid, and ready wit, Will share with us the common benefit. Now speak to the business and be not afraid The birds will adhere to the truce that we made. The long series of AnapÃ¦stic lines which follows, holds the place of the debates which occur in other comedies, and which are conducted in AnapÃ¦stic verse. Peisthetairus could not properly have been matched with an opponent or antagonist; the uniformity of his speech is however relieved by the interruptions and comments of Euelpides, who acts an under part to him, much in the same style as a Merry Andrew to a Mountebank. Observe that Peisthetairus never vouchsafes an answer or takes any kind of notice of his companion, but proceeds continuously, except once or twice in reply to the Chorus and the Hoopoe. Peis.- I'm fill'd with the subject and long to proceed My rhetorical leaven is ready to knead.â âBoy bring me a crown A crown was worn by the public orators when haranguing the people, and also at feasts. and a basin and ewer. Eu.- Why what does he mean? Are we banqueting sure? Peis.- A rhetorical banquet I mean; and I wish To serve them at first with a sumptuous dish, To astound and delight them. The inverted commas mark the premeditatedly abrupt exordium of Peisthetairus's harangue. âThe grief and compassion âThat oppresses my mind on beholding a nation âA people of sovereigns ... Cho. âSovereigns we! Peis.- Of all the creation! of this man and me, And of Jupiter too; for observe that your birth Was before the old Titans, and Saturn and Earth. Cho.- And Earth!? Peis. âI repeat it. Cho. âThat's wonderful news! Peis.- Your wonder implies a neglect to peruse, And examine old Ãsop; from whom you might gather, That the lark was embarrass'd to bury his father; On account of the then non-existence of Earth; And how to repair so distressing a dearth, He adopted a method unheard of and new. Cho.- If the story you quote, is authentic and true; No doubt can exist of our clear seniority; And the gods must acknowledge our right to authority. Eu.- Your beaks will be worn with distinction and pride; The wood-pecker's title will scarce be denied; And Jove the pretender, will surely surrender. Peis.- ... Moreover, most singular facts are combin'd In proof, that the birds were ador'd by mankind: For instance; the cock was a sovereign of yore In the empire of Persia, and rul'd it before Darius's time; and you all may have heard, That his title exists, as the âPersian bird.â ... Eu.- And hence you behold him stalk in pride, Majestic and stout, with a royal stride, With his turban upright, a privilege known Reserv'd to kings and kings alone. Peis.- ... So wide was his empire, so mighty his sway, That the people of earth to the present day, Attend to his summons and freely obey: Tinkers, tanners, coblers, all, Are rous'd from rest at his royal call, And shuffle their shoes on before it is light, To trudge to the workshop. Eu. âI warrant you're right; I know to my cost, by the cloak that I lost; It was owing to him I was robb'd and beguil'd. For a feast had been made for a neighbour's child, To give it a name; and I went as a guest, And sat there carouzing away with the rest; But drinking too deep, I fell soundly asleep; And he began crowing; and I never knowing, But thinking it morning, went off at the warning, (With the wine in my pate, to the city gate) And fell in with a footpad was lying in wait, Just under the town; and was fairly knocked down; Then I tried to call out; but before I could shout, He stripp'd me at once with a sudden pull, Of a bran new mantle of Phrygian wool. Peis.- ... Then the kite was the monarch of Greece heretofore ... Hoo.- Of Greece? Peis ... and instructed our fathers of yore, On beholding a kite, to fall down and adore ... Eu.- Well, a thing that befell me, was comical quite, I threw myself down on beholding a kite; But turning my face up to stare at his flight, With a coin in my mouth, It was usual with the Greeks to put small pieces of silver coin in their mouths, a custom which the turnpike men of Great Britain continued to retain within the reeollection of the writer. forgetting my penny, I swallowed it down, and went home without any. Peis.- ... In Sidon and Egypt the Cuckoo was king; They wait to this hour for the Cuckoo to sing; And when he begins, be it later or early, They reckon it lawful to gather their barley ... Eu.- Ah thence it comes our harvest cry, Cuckoo Cuckoo to the passers by. Peis.- .. At an Ã¦ra moreover of modern date, Menelaus the king, Agamemnon the great, Had a bird as assessor attending in state, Perch'd on his sceptre, to watch for a share Of fees and emoluments, secret or fair. Eu.- Ah there I perceive, I was right in my guess, For when Priam appeared in his tragical dress, The bird on his sceptre, I plainly could see, Was watching Lysicrates Of Lysicrates the scholiast only informs us that he was a person in office known to be in the habit of taking bribes, a description which in relation to those times is hardly a distinction. taking a fee. Peis.- .. Nay Jupiter now that usurps the command Appears with an eagle, appointed to stand As his emblem of empire; a striking example Of authority once so extended and ample: And each of the gods had his separate fowl, Apollo a Hawk, and Minerva an Owl. Eu.- That's matter of fact and you're right in the main; But what was the reason I wish you'd explain? This speech seems more properly to belong to the Hoopoe. Peis.- The reason was this: that the bird should be there, To demand as of right a proportional share, Of the entrails and fat, when an offering was made, A suitable portion before them was laid: Moreover you'll find, that the race of mankind Always swore by a bird; and it never was heard That they swore by the gods, at the time that I mention. And Lampon As a substitute for common swearing, some persons (Socrates among the rest) made use of less offensive expletives, swearing âby the dog or by the goose.ââLampon was a soothsayer, and thought it right probably to be scrupulous in using the name of the god. He is mentioned again in this play. himself, with a subtle intention, Adheres to the old immemorial use; He perjures and cheats us and swears âby the goose.â Thus far forth have I prov'd and shewn The power and estate that were once your own Now totally broken and overthrown: And need I describe, your present tribe, Weak forlorn, expos'd to scorn, Distress'd, oppress'd, never at rest, Daily pursued, with outrage rude; With cries and noise, of men and boys, Screaming, hooting, pelting, shooting, The fowler sets his traps and nets, Twigs of bird-lime, loops, and snares, To catch you kidnap'd unawares; Even within the temple's pale. They set you forth to public sale, Paw'd and handled most severely: And not content with roasting merely, In an insolent device, Sprinkle you with cheese and spice; With nothing of respect or favor, Derogating from your flavor. Or for a further outrage, have ye Sous'd in greasy sauce and gravy. Hoo.- Sad and dismal is the story, Human stranger which you tell, Of our fathers' ancient glory, E're the fated empire fell. From the depth of degradation, A benignant happy fate Sends you to restore the nation; To redeem and save the state. I consign to your protection, Able to preserve them best, All my objects of affection, My wife, my children, and my nest. If the Reader should be inclined to pass over the next hundred lines, I should feel no wish to detain him. The subject of them has been pretty nearly anticipated, and the whole play is in fact too long. Hoo.- Explain then the method you mean to pursue To recover our empire and freedom anew. For thus to remain, in dishonor and scorn, Our life were a burthen no more to be borne. Peis.- Then I move, that the birds shall in common repair To a centrical point, and encamp in the air; And intrench and enclose it, and fortify there: And build up a rampart, impregnably strong, Enormous in thickness, enormously long; Bigger than Babylon; solid and tall, With bricks and bitumen, a wonderful wall. Eu.- Bricks and bitumen! I'm longing to see What a daub of a building, the city will be! Peis.- .. As soon as the fabric is brought to an end, A herald or envoy to Jove we shall send, To require his immediate prompt abdication; And if he refuses, or shews hesitation, Or evades the demand; we shall further proceed, With legitimate warefare avow'd and decreed: With a warning and notices, formally given, To Jove, and all others residing in heaven, Forbidding them, ever to venture again To trespass on our atmospheric domain, With scandalous journies, to visit a list Of Alcmenas and Semeles; if they persist. We warn them, that means will be taken moreover To stop their gallanting and acting the lover. Another ambassador also will go Dispatch'd upon earth, to the people below; To notify briefly the fact of accession; And enforcing our claims upon taking possession: With orders in future; that every suitor, Who applies to the gods with an offering made; Shall begin, with a previous offering paid To a suitable Bird; of a kind and degree That accords with the god, whosoever he be. In Venus's fane, if a victim is slain, First let a Sparrow be feasted with grain. When gifts and oblations to Neptune are made, To the Drake let a tribute of barley be paid. Let the Cormorant's appetite With the writers of the old Comedy extreme voracity was the characteristic attribute of Hercules. first be appeas'd, And let Hercules then have an Ox for his feast. If you offer to Jove as the Sov'reign above, A Ram for his own; let the Golden-Crown, As a sov'reign Bird, be duly preferr'd, Feasted and honor'd, in right of his reign; With a jolly fat pismire offer'd and slain. Eu.- A pismire, how droll! I shall laugh till I burst! Let Jupiter thunder, and threaten his worst! Hoo.- But mankind, will they, think ye, respect and adore, If they see us all flying, the same as before? They will reckon us merely as Magpies and Crows. Peis.- Poh! nonsense I tell yeâno blockhead but knows That Mercury flies; there is Iris too; Homer informs us how she flew: âSmooth as a Dove, she went sailing along.â And pinions of gold, both in picture and song, To Cupid and Victory fairly belong. Hoo.- But Jove's thunder has wings; if he send but a volley, Mankind for a time may abandon us wholly. Peis.- What then? we shall raise a granivorous troop, To sweep their whole crops with a ravenous swoop: If Ceres is able, perhaps she may deign, To assist their distress, with a largess of grain ... Eu.- No no! she'll be making excuses I warrant. Peis ... Then the Crows will be sent on a different errand, To pounce all at once, with a sudden surprise, On their oxen and sheep, to peck out their eyes, And leave them stone blind for Apollo to cure: He'll try it; he'll work for his salary sure! Eu.- Let the cattle alone; I've two beeves of my own: Let me part with them first; and then do your worst. Peis ... But, if men shall acknowledge your merit and worth, As equal to Saturn, to Neptune, and Earth, And to every thing else; we shall freely bestow All manner of blessings. Hoo. âExplain them and shew. Peis.- For instance: if locusts arrive to consume All their hopes of a crop, when the vines are in bloom, A squadron of Owls may demolish them all; The Midges moreover, which canker and gall The figs and the fruit, if the Thrush is employ'd, By a single battalion will soon be destroy'd. Hoo.- But wealth is their object; and how can we grant it? Peis.- We can point them out mines; and our help will be wanted To inspect, and direct navigation and trade; Their voyages all will be easily made, With a saving of time, and a saving of cost; And a seaman in future will never be lost. Hoo.- How so? Peis. âWe shall warn them;ââNow hasten to sail, âNow keep within harbour; your voyage will fail.â Eu.- How readily then will a fortune be made! I'll purchase a vessel and venture on trade. Peis. .. And old treasure conceal'd will again be reveal'd; The Birds as they know it, will readily shew it. 'Tis a saying of old âMy silver and gold âAre so safely secreted, and closely interr'd, âNo creature can know it, excepting a Bird.â The want of stability and good faith both in the Government and individuals obliged the Greeks to secure their monied capital by concealment. Hence the vast collections of ancient coin which appear in the cabinets of antiquarians. Observe the shallow shatter-brained character of Euelpides. Eu.- I'll part with my vessel, I'll not go aboard; I'll purchase a mattock and dig up a hoard. Hoo.- We're clear as to wealth; but the blessing of health, Is the gift of the gods. Peis. âIt will make no such odds: If they're going on well, they'll be healthy still, And none are in health, that are going on ill. Hoo. âBut then for longevity; that is the gift Of the gods. The origin of this notion of life being transferable, cannot be accounted for; in the form of a wish, it appears to have been common. Peis. âBut the Birds can afford them a lift, And allow them a century, less or more. Hoo.- How so? Peis. âFrom their own individual store: They may reckon it fair, to allot them a share; For old proverbs affirm, that the final term Of a Raven's life exceeds the space Of five generations of human race. Ho.- What need have we then for Jove as a king?! Surely the Birds are a better thing! This speech must belong to the Hoopoe. Aristophanes would not leave the result of the scene to be summed up by such a silly fellow as Euelpides. We see besides that Peisthetairus replies to it. He never replies to Euelpides. Peis.- Surely! surely! First and most, We shall economize the cost Of marble domes and gilded gates. The Birds will live at cheaper rates, Lodging, without shame or scorn, In a maple or a thorn; The most exalted and divine Will have an olive for his shrine. We need not run to foreign lands, Or Ammon's temple in the sands; But perform our easy vows, Among the neighbouring shrubs and boughs; Paying our oblations fairly, With a pennyworth of barley. Cho.- O best of all envoys, suspected before, Now known and approv'd, and respected the more; To you we resign the political lead, Our worthy director in council and deed. Elated with your bold design, I swear and vow: If resolutely you combine Your views and interest with mine; In steadfast councils as a trusty friend, Without deceit, or guile or fraudful end: They that rule in haughty state, The gods ere long shall abdicate Their high command; And yield the sceptre to my rightful hand. Then reckon on us for a number and force; As on you we rely for a ready resource, In council and policy, trusting to you, To direct the design we resolve to pursue. There can be no doubt, that this speech belongs to the Chorus, though it may seem difficult to account for what is said of the sceptre, which it should seem ought rather to belong to the king. The Hoopoe in answer alludes to the inveterate vice of all Choruses,-dawdling and inefficiency. Hoo.- That's well, but we've no time by Jove to loiter, And dawdle and postpone like Nicias. The Athenians were at that time disappointed at Nicias's delay, in not advancing immediately against Syracuse. We should be doing something. First however I must invite you to my roosting place, This nest of mine, with its poor twigs and leaves. And tell me what your names are? Peis. âCertainly; My name is Peisthetairus. Peisthetairus answers like a man of sense. Euelpides like a a simpleton, and we see the effect of it on the king's mind. There is a momentary pause in the invitation, before they are both included in it. Hoo. âAnd your friend? Eu.- Euelpides from Thria. Hoo. âWell you're welcomeâ âBoth of ye. Peis. âWe're oblig'd. Hoo. âWalk in together. Peis.- Go first then, if you please. Hoo. âNo, pray move forward. Peis.- But bless me ... stop pray ... just for a single moment Let's see ... do tell me ... explain ... how shall we manage To live with you ... with a person wearing wings? Being both of us unfledg'd? Hoo. âPerfectly well! Peis.- Yes, but I must observe; that Ãsop's fables Report a case in point; the fox and eagle: The fox repented of his fellowship; And with good cause; you recollect the story. Peisthetairus has shown that he is not deficient in valour upon compulsion. But a character of extreme subtlety is always prone to suspicion, and the recollection of an example derived from ancient documents in Ãsop's Fables, intimidates him for a moment, and makes him distrustful of the frank invitation of the king. He is then very much ashamed of himself, and like Bacchus and Master Slender begins giving orders to his servants, and is importunate and hurried and absurd. Thus the poet, who wanted some lines of strong importunity to mark the entrance of his favorite Musician, has contrived to give them to his principal personage, and at the same time to mark his character itself more distinctly, by this momentary failure of his habitual self possession, originating in the apprehension of having lowered himself in the estimation of his host. Hoo.- Oh! don't be alarm'd! we'll give you a certain root That immediately promotes the growth of wings. Peis.- Come let's go in then; Xanthias do you mind, And Manodorus These slaves do not appear elsewhere in the play; it might be doubted whether they appear here and whether Peisthetairus does not call for them in mere nervous absence of mind. follow with the bundles, Cho.- Holloh! Hoo. âWhat's the matter? Cho. âGo in with your party, And give them a jolly collation and hearty. But the Bird, to the Muses and Graces so dear, The lovely sweet Nightingale, bid her appear, And leave her amongst us, to sport with us here. Peis.- O yes, by Jove, indeed, you must indulge them; With a hurried nervous eagerness. Do, do me the favor, call her from the thicket! For heaven's sakeâlet me entreat youâbring her here, And let us have a sight of her ourselves, Hoo.- Since it is your wish and pleasure it must be so; Come here to the strangers Procne! shew yourself! With grave good breeding, implying a kind of rebuke to the fussy importunity into which Peisthetairus had fallen. Peis.- O Jupiter what a graceful charming bird! What a beautiful creature it is! Eu. âI'll tell ye what; I could find in my heart to rumple her feathers. Peis.- And what an attire she wears, all bright with gold! Eu.- Well, I should like to kiss her, for my part. Peis.- You blockhead, with that beak, she'd run you through. Eu.- By Jove then, one must treat her like an egg; Just clear away the shell and kiss her ... thus. Hoo.- Let's go! Gravely disapproving the liberties which are taken in his presence. Peis. âGo first then and good luck go with us. [Exeunt. The Actors having left the stage the Parabasis ought to follow.âIt is here preface in a singular way by a complimentary song from the Chorus, addressed to the favorite female Musician. Cho.- O lovely sweet companion meet, From morn to night my sole delight, My little, happy, gentle mate, You come, you come, O lucky fate, Returning here with new delight, See what is said in the Preface. She had been engaged for this performance, and was newly arrived. To charm the sight, to charm the sight, And charm the ear. Come then anew combine Your notes in harmony with mine, And with a tone beyond compare Begin your AnapÃ¦stic air. The sudden passion for science among the Athenians, and the ridicule of it among the comic poets has been already noticed. Much might be said on the subject of the most splendid passage of the Parabasis, and of the philosophic system of which it presents the traces: but this would lead to considerations very remote from the imitation of actual life, and manners and character; which, as constituting the most singular excellence of the author, it has been the object of the translator to illustrate. Of the Parabasis before us, the merits are well known, and perhaps no passage in Aristophanes has been oftener quoted with admiration. To bring the most sublime subjects within the verge of Comedy, and to treat of them with humour and fancy, without falling into vulgarity or offending the principles of good taste, seems a task which no poet whom we know of, could have accomplished: Though if we were possessed of the works of Epicharmus, it is possible, that we might see other specimens of the same style. Ye Children of Man! whose life is a span, Protracted with sorrow from day to day, Naked and featherless, feeble and querulous, Sickly calamitous creatures of clay! Attend to the words of the Sovereign Birds, (Immortal, illustrious, lords of the air) Who survey from on high, with a merciful eye, Your struggles of misery, labour, and care. Whence you may learn and clearly discern Such truths as attract your inquisitive turn; Which is busied of late, with a mighty debate, A profound speculation about the creation, And organical life, and chaotical strife, With various notions of heavenly motions, And rivers and oceans, and valleys and mountains, And sources of fountains, and meteors on high, And stars in the sky .. We propose by and by, (If you'll listen and hear) to make it all clear. And Prodicus henceforth shall pass for a dunce, When his doubts are explain'd and expounded at once. Before the creation of Ãther and Light, Chaos and Night together were plight, In the dungeon of Erebus foully bedight. Nor Ocean, or Air, or substance was there, Or solid or rare, or figure or form, But horrible Tartarus rul'd in the storm: At length, in the dreary chaotical closet Of Erebus old, was a privy deposit, By Night the primÃ¦val in secresy laid; A Mystical Egg, that in silence and shade Was brooded and hatch'd; till time came about: And Love, the delightful, in glory flew out, In rapture and light, exulting and bright, Sparkling and florid, with stars in his forehead, His forehead and hair, and a flutter and flare, As he rose in the air, triumphantly furnish'd To range his dominions, on glittering pinions, All golden and azure, and blooming and burnish'd: He soon, in the murky Tartarean recesses, With a hurricane's might, in his fiery caresses Impregnated Chaos; and hastily snatch'd To being and life, begotten and hatch'd, The primitive Birds: but the Deities all, The celestial Lights, the terrestrial Ball, Were later of birth, with the dwellers on earth, More tamely combin'd, of a temperate kind; When chaotical mixture approach'd to a fixture. Our antiquity prov'd; it remains to be shewn; That Love is our author, and master alone, Like him, we can ramble, and gambol and fly O'er ocean and earth, and aloft to the sky: And all the world over, we're friends to the lover, And when other means fail, we are found to prevail, When a Peacock or Pheasant is sent as a present. All lessons of primary daily concern, You have learnt from the Birds, and continue to learn, Your best benefactors and early instructors; We give you the warning of seasons returning. When the Cranes are arrang'd, and muster afloat In the middle air, with a creaking note, Steering away to the Lybian sands; Then careful farmers sow their lands; The crazy vessel is haul'd ashore, The sail, the ropes, the rudder and oar Are all unshipp'd, and hous'd in store. The Shepherd is warn'd, by the Kite re-appearing, To muster his flock, and be ready for shearing. You quit your old cloak, at the Swallow's behest, In assurance of summer, and purchase a vest. For Delphi, for Ammon, Dodona, in fine For every oracular temple and shrine, The Birds are a substitute equal and fair, For on us you depend, and to us you repair For council and aid, when a marriage is made, A purchase, a bargain, a venture in trade: Unlucky or lucky, whatever has struck ye, An Ox or an Ass, that may happen to pass, A Voice in the street, or a Slave that you meet, A Name or a Word by chance overheard, If you deem it an Omen, you call it a Bird; And if birds are your omens, it clearly will follow; That birds are a proper prophetic Apollo. Then take us as Gods, and you'll soon find the odds, We'll serve for all uses, as Prophets and Muses; We'll give ye fine weather, we'll live here together; We'll not keep away, scornful and proud, a-top of a cloud, (In Jupiter's way); but attend every day, To prosper and bless, all you possess, And all your affairs, for yourselves and your heirs. And as long as you live, we shall give You wealth and health, and pleasure and treasure, In ample measure; And never bilk, you of pidgeon's milk, Or potable gold; you shall live to grow old, In laughter and mirth, on the face of the earth, Laughing, quaffing, carouzing, bouzing, Your only distress, shall be the excess Of ease and abundance and happiness. Semichorus. We see here a comic imitation of the Tragic Choruses of Phrynichus, a poet older than Ãschylus, of whom Aristophanes always speaks with respect, as an improver of music and poetry,âarts which in the judgment of the antients were deemed inseparable; or if disjoined essentially defective and imperfect. Muse, that in the deep recesses Of the forest's dreary shade, Vocal with our wild addresses; Or in the lonely lowly glade, Attending near, art pleas'd to hear, Our humble bill tuneful and shrill. When, to the name of omnipotent Pan, Our notes we raise, or sing in praise, Of mighty Cybele, from whom we began; Mother of nature, and every creature, Wing'd or unwing'd, of birds or man. Aid and attend, and chaunt with me The music of Phrynichus, open and plain, The first that attempted a loftier strain, Ever busy like the bee, with the sweets of harmony. Epirrema. Is there any person present sitting a spectator here, Who desires to pass his time, freely without restraint or fear? Should he wish to colonize; he never need be check'd or chid, For the trifling indiscretions, which the testy laws forbid. Parricides are in esteem: among the birds we deem it fair; A combat honorably fought betwixt a game-cock and his heir! There the branded runagate, branded and mottled in the face, Will be deemed a motley bird; a motley mark is no disgrace. Spintharus the Phrygian born, will pass a muster there with ease, Counted as a Phrygian fowl; and even Execestides, Already noted as a foreigner in the first scene of this play. Once a Carian and a slave; may there be nobly born and free; Plume himself on his descent, and hatch a proper pedigree. Semichorus. This second sample of the style of Phrynichus may serve to give us a more distinct idea of it. It seems to have been one of essential grandeur and harmony, but trespassing occasionally into the regions of nonsense. Thus the Swans in chorus follow, On the mighty Thracian stream, Hymning their eternal theme. Praise to Bacchus and Apollo: The welkin rings, with sounding wings, With songs and cries and melodies; Up to the thunderous Ãther ascending: Whilst all that breathe, on earth beneath, The beasts of the wood, the plain and the flood, In panic amazement are crouching and bending; With the awful qualm, of a sudden calm, Ocean and air in silence blending. The ridge of Olympus is sounding on high, Appalling with wonder the lords of the sky, And the Muses and Graces Enthron'd in their places, Join in the solemn symphony. Antepirrema. Nothing can be more delightful than the having wings to wear! A spectator sitting here, accommodated with a pair, Might for instance (if he found a tragic chorus dull and heavy) Take his flight, and dine at home; and if he did not chuse to leave ye, Might return in better humour, when the weary drawl was ended. Introduce then wings in useâbelieve me, matters will be mended: Patroclides The posthumous celebrity of Patroclides is not confined to this single event.âHe survived the accident many years, and was the author of a very salutary decree upon the principles advocated by the Poet in the Epirrema of the Frogs, but (as in the instance before us) he was again fatally too late.âThe decree was not passed till after the destruction of the navy at Ãgos Potamos. would not need, to sit there, and befoul his seat; Flying off he might return, eas'd in a moment, clean and neat. Trust me wings are all in all! Diitrephes has mounted quicker Than the rest of our aspirants, soaring on his wings of wicker: Basket work, and Crates, and Hampers, first enabled him to fly; His property consisted in a manufactory of this kind, by which he had grown rich. First a Captain, then promoted to command the cavalry; With his fortunes daily rising, office and preferment new, An illustrious, enterprizing, airy, gallant Cockatoo. The exclusive functions of the Chorus being now at an end; the persons of the Drama appear again upon the stage. Peisthetairus and Euelpides, having been both in the meanwhile equipped with a sumptuous pair of wings.âThey are supposed to have been entertained behind the scenes, with a royal collation in the palace of the Hoopoe.âPeisthetairus is accordingly in extreme good humour; and being now in the height of his advancement, recollects that it will be right to behave to his former comrade with the hearty familiarity of an old acquaintance; he accordingly begins, with a ludicrous simile This is the sort of raillery which Bacchus prohibits in the contest between Euripides and Ãschylus, and of which we have a specimen in the Wasps 1308.âSome modern traveller has told us that abusive similies in alternate extempore verse, serve for an amusement, at this day, to the boatmen of the Nile. on his appearance (a species of raillery common among the Athenians, but which was considered as the lowest species of jocularity). He takes his friend's retort in perfect good humour, and Euelpides is admitted as a third person, to consult, with him and the King, upon some unimportant matters; such as the name of the new City, and the choice of a patron Deity; upon all which topics, his idle buffoonish humour is not misplaced: but a more delicate point is afterwards brought into discussion (nothing less than the choice of a chief commander for the Citadel) which Euelpides treats with the same silly drollery as before. Peisthetairus is irritated or pretends to be so; and dismisses him in a tone of authority; which the other resents, and appears on the point of mutinying; upon which Peisthetairus smooths him down again, as briefly as possible; and having accomplished this point; immediately turns away from him, to call a servant! Peis. Well there it is! Such a comical set out, By Jove I never saw! Eu. âWhy what's the matter? What are you laughing at? Peis. âAt your pen feathers: I'll tell ye exactly now, the thing you're like; You're just the perfect image of a Goose, Drawn with a pen in a writing master's flourish. Eu.- And you're like a pluck'd Blackbird to a tittle. Peis.- Well then according to the line in Ãschylus âIt's our own fault, the feathers are our own.â Ãschyles alludes to a fable in which an eagle complains of being wounded by an arrow feathered from his own wings. Eu.- Come what's to be done. Hoo. âFirst we must choose a name, Some grand sonorous name, for our new city: Then we must sacrifice. Eu. âI think so too. Peis.- Let's see .. let's think of a name .. what shall it be? What say ye, to the Lacedemonian name? Sparta sounds well .. suppose we call it Sparta. Eu.- Sparta! What Sparto Sparto still retains its name, and is still used for mattrasses and occasionally for cordage.?âRushes!âno not I, I'd not put up with Sparto, for a mattrass; Much less for a cityâwe're not come to that. Peis.- Come then, what name shall it be? Eu. âSomething appropriate, Something that sounds majestic, striking and grand, Alluding to the clouds and the upper regions. Peis.- What think ye of Clouds and Cuckoos? Cuckoo-cloudlands Or Nephelococcugia? Hoo. âThat will do; A truly noble and sonorous name! Eu.- I wonder, if that Nephelococcugia, Is the same place I've heard of: people tell me, That all Theagenes's rich possessions Lie there; and Ãschines's whole estate. Peis.- Yes! Many Athenians (as Miltiades, Alcibiades and Thucidides the Historian) were proprietors of large estates in the Chersonese and along the coasts of Thrace: Theagenes it seems, and Ãschines, boasting of wealth which they did not posses, chose to talk of their estates in Thrace. In the last century the West Indies was the usual locality assigned to fabulous estates.âThrace was also mythologically fabulous, as the field of battle between Jupiter and the Titans. and a better country it is by far, Than all that land in Thrace, the fabulous plain Of Phlegra; where those earthborn landed Giants Were bullied and out-vapour'd by the gods. Eu.- It will be a genteelish smart concern, I reckon, This City of ours .. Which of the Deities Shall we have for a patron? We must weave our mantle, Our sacred mantle of course .. the yearly mantle See Knights p. 46, note. To one or other of 'em, Peis. âWell Minerva? Why should not we have Minerva? she's establish'd, Let her continue; she'll do mighty well. Eu.- No .. there I object; for a well orderd city, The example would be scandalous; to see The Goddess, a female born, in complete armour From head to foot; and Cleisthenes Ridiculed for his effeminacy in various comedies with a distaff. Peis.- What warden will ye appoint for the Eagle tower, Your Citadel, the fort upon the rock? Hoo.- That charge will rest with a chief of our own choice, Of Persian race, a chicken of the game, An eminent warrior. Eu. âOh my chicky-hiddyâ My little master.âI should like to see him, Strutting about and roosting on the rock. Peis.- Come you now! please to step to the atmosphere, And give a look to the work, and help the workmen; And between whiles, fetch bricks and tiles, and such like; Draw water, stamp the mortar,âdo it barefoot; Climb up the ladders; tumble down again: Keep constant watch and ward; conceal your watch lights; Then go the rounds, and give the countersign, Till you fall fast asleep. Send heralds off, âA brace of themâone to the gods above; And another, down below there, to mankind. Bid them, when they return, enquire for me. Eu.- For me! For me! You may be hang'd for me. Peis.- Come friend, go where I bid you; never mind; The business can't go on without you, any how. It's just a sacrifice to these new deities, That I must wait for; and the priest that's coming. Holloh you boy there! bring the bason and ewer! In the passage which follows the author ridicules the rage for vulgar realities (a corruption of the theatric art, essentially destructive of all illusion, as we have witnessed at home, with real water, real horses, real elephants) The stage of Athens it should seem had been degraded by a real sacrifice, the paltriness of such a spectacle, is marked by the magnificent exhortation of the Chorus, contrasted with the meanness of the execution which they anticipate. Cho.- We urge, we exhort you, and advise, To ordain a mighty sacrifice; And before the gods to bring A stupendous offering; âEither a sheep or some such thing!â To please the critics of the age, Sacrific'd upon the stage.â Sound amain the Pythian strain! Let ChÅris ChÅris, a bad musician, (the constant but of the comic poets) is called for, to complete the shabbiness of the performance. His representative, the Crow, (who is the ChÅris among the birds) sounds some discordant notes till Peisthetairus stops him. be brought here to sing. Peis.- Have done there with your puffing .. Heaven and Earth, What's here! I've seen a many curious things, But never saw the like of this before, A Crow with a flute and a mouthpiece.âPriest your office: Perform it!âSacrifice to the new deities! Pri.- I will .. but where's the boy gone with the basket? Let us pray to the holy flame, And the holy Hawk that guards the same; To the sovereign Deities, All and each, of all degrees, Female and male! Cho.- Hail thou Hawk of Sunium hail! Pri.- To the Delian and the Pythian Swan, And to the Latonian Quail, All hail! Cho.- To the Bird of awful stature, Mother of Gods, mother of Man; Great Cybele! nurse of Nature! Glorious Ostrich hear our cry! Fearful and enormous creature, Hugest of all things that fly, O preserve and prosper us Thou mother of Cleocritus! Of Cleocritus nothing is known except that he was unfortunate in his figure, which was thought to resemble that of an ostrich. Grant the blessings that we seek, For us, and for the Chian's eke! Peis.- That's right, the Chiansâdon't forget the Chians! Pri.- To the Heroes, Birds, and Heroes' sons, We call at once, we call and cry, To the Woodpecker, the Jay, the Pie, To the Mallard and the Widgeon, To the Ringdove and the Pidgeon, To the Pettrel and Sea-mew, To the Dottrel and Curlew, To the Vultures and the Hawks, To the Cormorants and Storks, To the Rail, to the Quail, To the PeewÃ¬t, to the TomtÃ¬t, Peisthetairus, who can do every thing better than every body else, undertakes to perform the sacrifice. This is sufficiently in character. By making him the chief operator, a greater comic effect is given to the series of interruptions which disturb him; until in despair he determines to transfer the sacrifice elsewhere.âIn this way the Poet avoids the vulgar reality which he had before ridiculed. Peis.- Have done there! call no more of 'em; are you mad? Inviting all the Cormorants and Vultures, For a victim such as this! Why don't you see, A Kite at a single swoop, would carry it off?â Get out of my way there with your Crowns and Fillets,! I'll do it myself! I'll make the sacrifice! Priest.- Then must I commence again, In a simple humble strain; And invite the gods anew, To visit usâbut very fewâ Or only just a single one, All alone In a quiet easy way; Ridicule of the vulgar reality, the poor half-starved sheep being standing on the stage. Wishing you may find enough, If you dine with us to-day. Our victim is so poor and thin, Merely bones, in fact, and skin. Peis.- We sacrifice and pray to the winged deities. Enter a Poet, very ragged and shabby with a very mellifluous submissive mendicatory demeanour. Peisthetairus, the essential man of business and activity, entertaining a supreme contempt for his profession and person, is at no great pains to conceal it; but recollecting at the same time, that it is adviseable to secure the suffrages of the literary world, and that the character of a patron is creditable to a great man, he patronizes him accordingly, not at his own expense, but by bestowing upon him certain articles of apparel put in requisition for that purpose. This first act of confiscation is directed against the property of the church; the scholiast informs us, that he begins by stripping the Priest. Poet.- âFor the festive, happy day, âMuse prepare an early lay, âTo Nephelococcugia.â Peis.- What's here to do? What are you? Where do you come from? Poet.- An humble menial of the Muses' train, As Homer expresses it. Peis. âA menial, are you? With your long hair? Slaves were forbidden to wear long hair. A menial? Poet. â'Tis not that, No!âbut professors of the poetical art, Are simply styl'd, the âMenials of the Muses,â As Homer expresses it. Peis. âAy, the Muse has giv'n you A ragged livery.âWell, but friend, I sayâ Friend!âPoet!âWhat the plague has brought you here? Poet.- I've made an Ode upon your new-built City, âAnd a charming composition for a Chorus,â And another, in Simonides's manner. Peis.- When were they made? What time? How long ago? In a sharp cross examining tone. Poet.- From early date, I celebrate in song, The noble Nephelococcugian state. Peis.- That's strange, when I'm just sacrificing here, For the first time, to give the town a name. Poet.- Intimations, swift as air, To the Muses' ear, are carried, Swifter, than the speed and force, Of the fiery footed horse, Hence, the tidings never tarried; The Scholiast informs us that these lines are in ridicule of certain mendicatory passages in the Odes of Pindar; one in particular, addressed to Hiero on the foundation of a new city.Father, patron, mighty lord, Founder of the rising state, What thy bounty can afford, Be it little, be it great, With a quick resolve, incline To bestow on me and mine. Peis.- This fellow will breed a bustle, and make mischief, If we don't give him a trifle, and get rid of him, âYou there, you've a spare waistcoat; pull it off! And give it this same clever ingenious poetâ There, take the waistcoat, friend!. Ye seem to want it! Poet.- Freely, with a thankful heart, What the bounteous hand bestows, Is receiv'd in friendly part; But amid the Thracian snows, Or the chilly Scythian plain, He the wanderer, cold and lonely, With an under-waistcoat only, Must, a further wish retain; Which, the Muse averse to mention, To your gentle comprehension, Trusts her enigmatic strain. Peis.- I comprehend it enough;âyou want a jerkin,â Here, give him yours;âone ought to encourage genius. There, take it, and good bye to ye! Poet.- Well, I'm going; And, as soon as I get to the town, I'll set to work; And finish something, in this kind of way. âSeated on your golden throne, âMuse, prepare a solemn ditty, âTo the mighty, âTo the flighty, âTo the cloudy, quivering, shivering, âTo the lofty seated city.â The Poet withdraws gradually turning round and reciting. Peisth. does not appear to take notice, but watches till he is fairly gone. Peis.- Well, I should have thought, that jerkin might have cur'd him, Of his âquiverings and shiverings.ââHow the plague! Did the fellow find us out?âI should not have thought it. Come, once again, go round with the basin and ewer.â Peace! Silence! Silence! Enter a Soothsayer with a great air of arrogance and self-importance. He comes on the authority of a book of Oracles (which he pretends to possess, but which he never produces), in virtue of which he lays claim to certain sacrificial perquisites and fees. Peisthetairus encounters him with a different version composed upon the spot; in virtue of which he dismisses the Soothsayer with a good lashing. Sooth. âStop the sacrifice! Peis.- What are you? Sooth. âA Soothsayer, that's what I am. Peis.- The worse luck for ye. Sooth. âFriend, are you in your senses? Don't trifle absurdly with religious matters. See p. 69 or 71 of the Knights, where there is the same allusion to disputes on the authentic copies of Oracles. Here's a prophecy of Bakis, which expressly Alludes to Nephelococcugia. Peis.- How came it, then, you never prophecied Your prophecies, before the town was built? Sooth. âThe spirit withheld me. Peis. âAnd is it allowable now, To give us a communication of them? Sooth. âHem! âMoreover, when the Crows and Daws unite, âTo build and settle, in the midway right, âBetween tall Corinth, and fair Sicyon's height, âThen to Pandora, let a milk white Goat âBe slain, and offer'd, and a comely coat âGiven to the soothsayer, and shoes a pair; âWhen he to you this oracle shall bear.â Peis.- Are the shoes mentioned? Sooth.- [pretending to feel for his papers.] Look at the book, and see! âAnd let him have the entrails for his share.â Peis.- Are the Entrails mentioned? Sooth.- [as before.] Look at the book, and see! âIf you, predestin'd youth, shall do these things, âThen you shall soar aloft, on eagle's wings; âBut, if you do not, you shall never be, âAn Eagle, nor a Hawk, nor bird of high degree.â Peis.- Is all this, there? Sooth.- [as before.] Look at the book, and see! Peis.- This oracle differs most remarkably, From that which I transcrib'd in Apollo's temple. âIf at the sacrifice .. The breaks in the text ... may serve to indicate what was mare distinctly expressed by the actor, viz. that Peisthetairus's Oracle is an extewpore production... which you prepare, âAn uninvited vagabond .... should dare âTo interrupt you, and demand a share, âLet cuffs and buffets .... be the varlet's lot. âSmite him between the ribs .... and spare him not.â Sooth.- Nonsense, you're talking! Peis.- [with the same action as the Soothsayer as if he were feeling for papers.] Look at the book, and see! âThou shalt in no wise heed them, or forbear âTo lash and smite those Eagles of the air, âNeither regard their names, for it is written, âLampon and Diopithes shall be smitten.â Sooth.- Is all this, there? Peis.- [producing a horsewhip.] Look at the book, and see! Get out! with a plague and a vengeance. Sooth. âOh dear! oh! Peis.- Go soothsay somewhere else, you rascal, run! [Exit Sooth.] Meton the Astronomer appears, encumbered with a load of mathematical instruments, which are disposed about his person. He advances with short steps, a straight back, and his chin in the air, modifying, by what he conceives to be a tone of condescending familiarity, a manner of habitual self-importance. Met.- I'm come, you see, to join you. Peis. â[aside] (Another plague!) For what? What's your design? Your plan, your notion? Your scheme,âyour apparatus,âyour equipment,â Your outfit? What's the meaning of it all? Met.- I mean to take a geometrical plan Of your atmosphereâto allot it, and survey it In a scientific form. Peis. âIn the name of heaven! Who are ye and what? What name? What manner of man? Met.- Who am I and what! Meton's my name, well known. In Greece, and in the village of Colonos. Peis.- But tell me, pray;âthese implements, these articles, P. going up to him and pulling them about. What are they meant for? Met. âThese areâInstruments! An atmospherical geometrical scale. First, you must understand, that the atmosphere Is form'd,âin a manner,âaltogether,âpartly, In the fashion of a furnace, or a funnel; I take this circular arc, with the moveable arm, And so, by shifting it round, till it coincides At the angle;âyou understand me? Peis. âNot in the least. Met.- .... I obtain a true division, with the quadrature Of the equilateral circle.âHere, I trace Meton with animation and action illustrative of the proposed plan. Your market place, in the centre, with the streets,â Converging inwards,â! and the roads, divergingâ! From the circular wall, without,â! like solar rays From the circular circumference of the Sun. Peis. [in a pretended soliloquy; then calling to him with a tone of mystery and alarm.] Another Thales! absolutely, a Thales!â âMeton! Met. â[startled] Why, what's the matter? Peis. âYou're aware, That, I've a regard for you. Take my advice; Don't be seen hereâWithdraw yourself,âabscond! Met.- Is there any alarm or risk? Peis. âWhy, much the same, As it might be in LacedÃ¦mon. There's a bustle Of expelling aliens; people are dragg'd out From the inns and lodgings, with a deal of uproar, And blows and abuse in plenty, to be met with In the public streets. Met. âA popular tumult,âheh? Peis.- Oh, Fie! no, nothing of that kind. Peist. scandalized at the supposition Met. âHow do you mean then? Peis.- We're carrying into effect a resolution During this speech Peisthetairus keeps his eye quietly fixed upon the Astronomer. Adopted lately; To discard and cudgel ... Coxcombs and Mountebanks ... of every kind. Met.- Perhaps ... I had best withdraw. Peis. âWhy yes, perhaps ... But yet, I would not answer for it, neither; Perhaps, you may be too late; the blows, I mention'd Are comingâclose upon youâthere they come! Met.- Oh bless me! Peis. âDid not I tell you, and give you warning? Get out you coxcomb, find out by your Geometry, The road you came, and measure it back: you'd best. [Exit Meton. A Commissioner from Athens advances with an air of importance and ascendancy; like other consequential persons sent on a foreign mission, he wishes it to be understood, that he considers it a sort of banishment. Com.- Is nobody here? None of the Proxeni, To receive and attend upon me? Peis. âWhat's all this? Sardanapalus A name proverbial for pomp and luxury, in person come amongst us! Com.- I come, appointed as Commissioner To Nephelococcugia. Peis. âA Commissioner! What brings you here? Com. âA paltry scrap of paper, A trifling silly decree, that sent me away Here to this place of yours. Peis. âWell now! suppose, To make things easy on both sidesâcould not you Just take your salary at once; and so return, Without any further trouble? Com. âTruly yes, I've other affairs at home: a speech and a motion, That I meant to have made in the general assembly, About a business, that I took in hand, On the part of my friend Pharnaces, the satrap. Peis.- Agreed then, and farewell. Here take your salary. Com.- What's here! [Peisthetairus has held out his left hand as if with an offer of money, he grasps the right hand of the Commissioner and with this advantage proceeds to buffet him.] Peis. âA motion on the part of Pharnaces! Com.- Bear witness hereâ! I'm beaten and abus'd In my character of Commissioner! [Exit Com. Peis. âGet out! With your balloting-box and all. It's quite a shame, Quite scandalous! They send commissioners here, Peisthetairus, in expectation of the Commissioner's return, is working himself into a proper state of wrath in order to be ready for him.âMere gratuitous complaint would not be suitable to his character. Before we've finished our first sacrifice. Enter a Hawker with copies of new laws relating to the colony, which he has brought out with him, for sale.âLike all itinerant venders of literature, he is trying to attract purchasers by reciting and bawling out select passages from the papers in his hand. The sale of them is his only object; and he is quite unconscious that the specimen which he recites is applicable to an incident which has just occurred. He enters on the opposite side with the monotonous chaunt of the vender of a last dying speech, confronting Peisthetairus, who is returning after having driven out the Commissioner. Haw.- âMoreover, if a Nephelococcugian âShould assault or smite an Athenian citizen.â .... Peis.- What's this? What's all this trumpery paper here? Haw. âI've brought you the new laws and ordinances, And copies of the last decrees to sell. Peis.- [dryly and bitterly] Let's hear 'em. Haw. ââIt is enacted and ordain'd, âThat the Nephelococcugians shall use âSuch standard weights and measures.â ... Peis. âFriend, you'll find Hard measure here, and a heavy weight, I promise you, Upon your shoulders shortly. Haw. âWhat's the matter? What's come to you? Peis. âGet out, with your decrees! I've bloody decrees against you, dire decrees. [drives him off. Com.- [returning] I summon Peisthetairus to his answer, In an action of assault and battery, For the first day of the month, Munichion. Peis.- Hah! say you so? You're there again! Have at you. [drives him off. Haw.- [returning] âAnd in case of any assault or violence, âAgainst the person of the Magistrate.â .... Peis.- Bless me! What you! You're there, again. [drives him off. Com. â[returning again] I'll ruin you; I'll lay my damages at ten thousand drachmas. Peis.- In the mean time, I'll smash your balloting boxes. Com.- Remember, how you effac'd the public monument, The sort of accusations which were current at the time similar to those of the mutilation of the HermÃ¦.âPeisthetairus does not take any notice or bestow a whole line upon his accuser; the last words of the verse are addressed to the Hawker. On the pillar, and defil'd it late last night. Peis.- Pah! stuff! There seize him, somebody.âWhat you're off, too. Come, let's remove, and get away from hence, And sacrifice our goat, to the Gods within doors. It is to be feared that without having it pointed out to him, the Reader will hardly be aware, that in some of the following lines an attempt is made, to imitate the effect of the spondaic passages in the original. Chorus. HenceforthâOur Worth, Our RightâOur Might, Shall be shewn, Acknowledg'd, known; Mankind shall raise Prayers, vows, praise, To the Birds alone. Our employ, is to destroy The vermin train, Ravaging amain, Your fruits and grain: We're the wardens Of your gardens, To watch and chase The wicked race, And cut them shorter, In hasty slaughter. The first lines of the Epirrema are descriptive of the cruel madness of the times.âSee Note to p. 24.âDiagoras was a Poet, a foreigner resident at Athens, (being suspected of Atheism, and consequently of being an accomplice in the imaginary plot,) he was proscribed and a price set upon his head; it seems also that in other instances which are alluded to, assassination was encouraged by public rewards. The history of a similar period.âThe times of Titus Oates's plot (admirably described by Roger North in his Examen) may serve to illustrate the lines 13 and 14, the community in both instances remaining subject to a reign of terror, under obscure wretches whose sole instrument of dominion was perjury; as it was necessary for those Sovereign Witnesses to extort respectable subsidiary evidence in support of their main system of perjury, threats and imprisonment were the means employed in both instances, as appears by the narrative of Andocides. Epirrema. At the present urgent crisis, all your efforts and attention Are directed to secure Diagoras's apprehension: Handsome bounties have been offer'd of a talent for his head Likewise, with respect to Tyrants (Tyrants, that are gone and dead) Bounties of a talent each, for all that can be kill'd or caught: With a zealous emulation, we, the Birds, have also thought Just and proper, to proclaim, from this time forth, that we withdraw From Philocrates, the fowler, the protection of the law: Furthermore, we fix a price, for bringing him alive or dead, Four, if he's secur'd alive; a single talent for his head: He, that Ortolans and Quails to market has presum'd to bring; And the sparrows, six a penny, tied together in a string, With a wicked art retaining, sundry Doves in his employ, Fasten'd, with their feet in fetters, forc'd to serve for a decoy; Farther, we declare and publish our command to men below, All the Birds you keep in prison, to release, and let them go. We shall, else, revenge ourselves, and we shall teach the tyrants yet, How to chirp and dance in fetters, in the tangles of a net. Chorus. Blest are they, The Birds alway, With perfect clothing, Fearing nothing, Cold or sleet or summer heat. As it chances, As he fancies, Each his own vagary follows, Dwelling in the dells and hollows; When, with eager weary strain, The shrilly grasshoppers complain, Parch'd upon the sultry plain; Madden'd with the raging heat, We secure a cool retreat, In the shady nooks and coves, Recesses of the sacred groves, Many an herb, and many a berry Serves to feast, and make us merry. Antepirrema. To the judges of the prize, we wish to mention in a word, The return we mean to make, if our performance is prefer'd. First then, in your empty coffers, you shall see the sterling owl, The figure of an owl stamped on the coin of Athens. From the mines of Laurium, familiar as a common fowl; Roosting among the bags and pouches, each at ease upon his nest; Undisturb'd, rearing and hatching little broods of interest: If you wish to cheat in office, but are inexpert and raw. You should have a kite for agent, capable to gripe and claw; Cranes and Cormorants shall help you, to a stomach and a throat; When you feast abroad, but, if you give a vile, unfriendly vote, Hasten and provide yourselves, each, with a little silver plate, Like the statues of the gods, for the protection of his pate; Else, when forth abroad you ramble, on a summer holiday, We shall take a dirty vengeance, and befoul your best array. In the following Scene, a foot messenger arrives at full speed from the new city, apparently in a state of great exhaustion. He communicates his important intelligence to Peisthetairus, in a single gasp of breath. âYour fortification's finished!â The report, which he makes of the building of a new Babylon, by the nation of the Birds, as it considerably exceeds, even, that licence of assuming impossibilities, which is the privilege of the ancient comedy, may lead us to examine the mode of humourous contrivance, by which the Author has managed in some degree, to maintain that balance between truth and falsehood, which I have (in another place) endeavoured to point out, as essential to the character of all dramatic representations whether serious or comic. The interest which we take in the development of moral truth, and in the illustration of human character, is so much stronger, than that which we attach to mere matter of fact, that, where the two are combined (that is to say, where a supposed fact is made the foundation of a new and striking illustration of character) our attention is, generally speaking, wholly directed to the latter, and we are inclined to take the fact for granted; as we allow the scrawl, which a mathematician draws, to stand for a circle or square; our whole attention being absorbed in the acquisition of a general and a permanent truth. It is, we believe, an established axiom in the art of lying, that almost any thing may be made credible of almost any person; provided that the imaginary facts are accompanied by a just representation of the behaviour of the person, such as it might be supposed to be under the alledged circumstances: and this will be more strikingly the case, if some trait of his character, not generally observed, but likely to be immediately recognized, is exhibited for the first time. It has been observed elsewhere, of the Aristophanic, or ancient comedy, that it is essentially a grave, humorous, impossible Great Lie, related with an accurate mimicry of the language and manners of the persons introduced. As the humour of a Narrative Lie is more easily comprehended than that of a dramatic one, we may venture to examine the drama, such as it would have appeared, if it had been helped out, in some degree, by a narrative comment; if, like the explanatory Heroic Prologue in Henry the Fifth, the ancient comedy had made use of a buffoonish prologue, explanatory and preparatory to the different scenes. We might suppose Aristophanes or his Prolocutor on this occasion to have said: âGentlemen, the information, which I apprehend you will shortly receive of the progress of the new buildings at Nephelococcugia, may perhaps strike you as extraordinary. I should not be surprised, if, to some amongst you, it should appear little short of being absolutely incredible; but I would not have you rely entirely upon your own judgment. There is Peisthetairus, who has every means of information, and of whose abilities you can have no doubt: you will see him as much astonished as any amongst you; and you will see him so, for the first, and only time. But, will he disbelieve the fact? Far from it. Like the judicious amongst yourselves, he will not entertain the least doubt of it; on the contrary, unless I am very much mistaken in his character, you will be able to detect evident symptoms of jealousy and uneasiness, at the idea of such an object having been accomplished, independently of his direction and superintendance; and indeed, not without reason; for, you will see, that both the chorus and the messenger himself, appear to abate something of their accustomed respect and deference to him. You will observe likewise, that the messenger is far from anticipating the slightest incredulity, as to the general fact of the completion of the work, of which he himself has been a witness; while he is apparently very anxious in his negative testimony, as to the total absence of any extraneous aid or assistance whatever.â Peisthetairus. Well, Friends and Birds! the sacrifice has succeeded, Our omens have been good ones: good and fair. âBut, what's the meaning of it? We've no news From the new building yet! No messenger! Oh! there at last, I see,âThere's somebody Running at speed, and panting like a racer. [Enter a messenger, quite out of breath; and speaking in short snatches.] Mess.- Where is he? Where? Where is he? Where? Where is he?â The president Peisthetairus? Peis. â[coolly] Here am I. Mess. â[in a gasp of breath] Your fortification's finish'd. Peis. âWell! That's well. Mess.- A most amazing, astonishing work it is! So, that Theagenes and Proxenides Pretenders to great wealth and affecting extraordinary expense and displayâSee note to p. 46. Might flourish and gasconade and prance away, Quite at their ease, both of them four-in-hand, Driving abreast upon the breadth of the wall, Each in his own new chariot. Peis. âYou surprise me. Mess.- And the height (for I made the measurement myself) Is exactly, a hundred fathom. Peis. âHeaven and earth! How could it be? such a mass! who could have built it? Mess.- The Birds; no creature else, no foreigners, Egyptian bricklayers, Egyptian labourers are mentioned in the Frogs. workmen or masons, But, they themselves, alone, by their own efforts, (Even to my surprise, as an eye-witness)â The Birds, I say, completed every thing: There came a body of thirty thousand Cranes (I wont be positive, there might be more) With stones from Africa, in their craws and gizzards, Which, the stone-curlews and stone-chatterers Work'd into shape and finish'd. The Sand-Martins, And Mud Larks, too, were busy in their department, Mixing the mortar, while the Water Birds, As fast as it was wanted, brought the water To temper, and work it. Peis. (in a fidget) But, who serv'd the masons? Who did you get to carry it? Mess. âTo carry it? Of course, the Carrion Crows and Carrying Pigeons. Peis.- [in a fuss, which he endeavours to conceal.] Yes! Yes! But after all, to load your hods, How, did you manage that? Mess. âOh capitally, I promise you.âThere were the Geese, all barefoot Trampling the mortar, and, when all was ready, They handed it into the hods, so cleverly, With their flat feet! Peis.- [A bad joke, as a vent for irritation. Like Falstaff, when he is annoyed and perplexed, joking perforce.] They footed it, you meanâ Come; it was handily done though, I confess. Mess. âIndeed, I assure you, it was a sight to see them; And trains of Ducks, there were, clambering the ladders, With their duck legs, like bricklayer's prentices, All dapper and handy, with their little trowels. Peis. In fact, then, it's no use engaging foreigners, Mere folly and waste, we've all within ourselves. Ah, well now, come! But, about the woodwork? Heh! Who were the carpenters? Answer me that! Peisthetairus is at a loss, unable to think of a new objection, he maintains his importance by a wise observation.-as soon as an objection occurs, he states it with great eagerness; but with no better success than before. Mess.- The woodpeckers, of course: and there they were, Labouring upon the gates, driving and banging, With their hard hatchet beaks, and such a din, Such a clatter, as they made, hammering and hacking, In a perpetual peal, pelting away Like shipwrights, hard at work in the arsenal. And now their work is finish'd, gates and all, Staples and bolts, and bars and every thing; The sentries at their posts; patroles appointed; The watchmen in the barbican; the beacons Ready prepar'd for lighting; all their signals Arrang'dâBut, I'll step out, just for a moment, To wash my hands.âYou'll settle all the rest. [Exit. [Peisthetairus, surprised at the rapid conclusion of the work, feeling from the volubility and easy manner of the messenger, the blow, which his authority has received; seeing, that nothing is left for him to superintend, nothing to direct, nothing to suggest, or to find fault with, remains in an attitude of perplexity and astonishment, with his hands clasped across his forehead.] Chorus.- [to Peisthetairus in a sort of self-satisfied drawling tone.] Heighday! Why, what's the matter with ye? Sure! Ah! well now, I calculate, you're quite astonish'd; You did not know the nature of our birds: I guess you thought it an impossible thing, To finish up your fortification job Within the time so cleverly. Peis.- [recovering himself and looking round.] Yes truly. Yes, I'm surpriz'd indeed; I must confessâ I could, almost imagine to myself, It was a dream, an illusion, altogetherâ âBut, there's the watchman of the town, I see! In alarm and haste, it seems! He's running hereâ [The watchman enters, with a shout of alarm] âWell what's the matter? W. âA most dreadful business: One of the Gods, just nowâJupiter's Godsâ Has bolted through the gates, and driven on Right into the atmosphere, in spite of us, And all the jack daws, that were mounting guard. Peis.- [animated at the prospect of having something to manage] What an outrage! what an insult! Which of 'em? Which of the Gods? W. âWe can't pretend to say; We just could ascertain, that he wore wings. We're clear upon that point. Peis. âBut a light party Peisthetairus is exposed to a fresh mortification; the orders which he was ready to give have been anticipated! He contrives however to detect an omission, and upon the strength of it to assume a tone of authority and command. Ought surely to have been sent in such a case; A detachmentâ W. âA detachment has been sent Already: a squadron of ten thousand Hawks, Besides a corps of twenty thousand hobby hawks, As a light cavalry, to scour the country: Vultures and Falcons, Ospreys, Eagles, all, Have sallied forth; the sound of wings is heard, Rushing and whizzing round on every side, In eager search.âThe fugitive divinity Is not far off, and soon must be discover'd. Peis.- Did nobody think of slingers? Where are they? Where are the slingers got to? Give me a sling. Arrows and slings, I say!âMake haste with'em Chorus. The verses which follow belong to a species of Songs, which are alluded to in Aristophanes more than once. They may properly be called âWatch-Songsâ, being sung by the Watchmen and Soldiers on guard, to keep themselves and their comrades awake and alert. War is at hand, On air and land, Proclaim'd and fixt. War and strife, Eager and rife, Are kindled a twixt, This state of ours, And the heavenly powers. Look with care, To the circuit of air, Watch lest he, The Deity, Whatever he be, Should unaware Escape and flee. But hark! The rushing sound of hasty wings Approaches us. The deity is at hand. Peis.- Holloh you! Where are ye flying? Where are ye going? Hold! Halt! Stop there I tell ye!âStop this instant! What are ye? Where do you come from? Speak, explain. Iris.- Me? From the Gods to be sure! the Olympian Gods. Peis.- [Pointing to the flaunting appendages of her dress.] Iris, the Rainbow personified, is of course attired in all the colours of the Rainbow, with abundance of lappets and streamers. What are ye? With all your flying trumpery! A helmet? or a galley? What's your name? Iris.- Iris, the messenger of the Gods. Peis. âA messenger! Oh! you're a naval messenger I reckon The Salaminian galley, or the Paralian? The two sacred gallies of the Athenians.âThe most splendidly equipt were dispatched upon the most important occasions. See note page 12. âYou're in full sail, I see. Iris. âWhat's here to do? Peis.- Are there no birds in waiting? Nobody To take her into custody? Iris. âMe, to custody? Why, what's all this? Peis. âYou'll find to your cost, I promise ye. Iris.- Well, this seems quite unaccountable! Peis. âWhich of the gates Did ye enter at, ye jade? How came you here? Iris.- Gates!âI know nothing about your gates, not I. Peis.- Fine innocent ignorant airs, she gives herself! You applied to the Pelicans, I suppose?âThe captain Of the Cormorants on guard admitted you? Iris.- Why, what the plague! what's this? Peis. âSo, you confess! âYou came without permission! Iris. âAre you mad? Peis.- Did neither the sitting magistrates, nor bird-masters Examine and pass you? Iris. âExamine me, forsooth! Peis.- This is the way then!âwithout thanks or leave You ramble and fly, committing trespasses In an atmosphere belonging to your neighbours! Iris.- And where would you have us fly then? Us the Gods! Peis.- I neither know nor care.âBut, I know this, They shan't fly here.âAnd another thing, I know. I knowâthat, if there ever was an instance Of an Iris or a rainbow, such as you; Detected in the fact, fairly condemn'd, And justly put to death;âit would be you. Iris.- But, I'm immortal. Peis.- [coolly and peremptorily.] That would make no difference: We should be strangely circumstanc'd indeed; With the possession of a Sovereign Power, And you, the Gods, in no subordination, No kind of order! fairly mutinying, Infringing and disputing our commands. âNow then, you'll please to tell meâwhere you're going? Which way you're steering with those wings of yours? Iris.- I? .... I'm commissioned from my father Jove, Iris in a great fright hesitating and hurried but attempting to assume a tone of authority. To summon human mortals to perform Their rites and offerings and oblations, due To the powers above. Peis. âAnd who do you mean? what powers? Iris.- What powers?! Ourselves, the Olympian Deities! Peis.- So then! you're Deities, the rest of ye! Iris.- Yes, to be sure. What others, should there be? Peis.- Rememberâ! once for allâ! that We, the Birds, Are the only Deities, from this time forth; And, not your father Jove. By Jove! not he! Iris.- Oh! rash, presumptuous wretch! Incense no more, The wrath of the angry Gods! lest Ruin drive A medley from terrific passages in the tragic poets. Her ploughshare o'er thy mansion; and Destruction, With hasty besom sweep thee to the dust; Or flaming Lightning smite thee with a flash, Left in an instant smouldering and extinct. Peis.- Do ye hear her?âQuite in tragedy!âquite sublime! Come, let me try for a bouncer in return. Peisthetairus at last hits upon a tragic passage which he thinks will serve for a suitable reply. A vulgar line which disfigures a very fine scene of Euripides. Let's see.âLet's recollect.ââMe dost thou deem, âLike a base Lydian or a Phrygian slave, With hyperbolical bombast to scare? I tell ye, and you may tell him.âJupiterâ âIf he provokes me, and pushes things too farâ Will see some Eagles of mine, to outnumber his, With firebrands in their claws about his house. And, I shall send a flight of my Porphyrions. The Greek name for a flamingo, also the name of one of the giants who made war against the gods. A hundred covey or more, arm'd cap-a-pee To assault him in his sublime celestial towers: Perhaps, he may remember in old times, He found enough to do with one Porphyrion. And for you Madam Iris, I shall strip Your rainbow-shanks, if you're impertinent, Depend upon it, and I myself, in person Will ravish you, myselfâ! Old as I am. Iris.- Curse ye, you wretch, and all your filthy words. Peis.- Come scuttle away; convey your person elsewhere; Be brisk, and leave a vacancy. Brush off. Iris.- I shall inform my father.âHe shall know Your rudeness and impertinence. He shall,â He'll settle ye and keep ye in order.âYou shall see. Peis.- Oh dear! is it come to that! No, you're mistaken, Young woman, upon that point, I'm not your man, I'm an old fellow grown; I'm thunder proof, Proof against flames and darts and female arts: You'd best look out, for a younger customer. Poor Iris, in her rage, unwittingly makes use of the same sort of phrase with which a young girl at Athens would repel, or affect to repel, improper familiarities. Peisthetairus, taking advantage of this, pretends to consider her indignation as a mere coquettish artifice intended to inveigle and allure him. The Athenian FatherââI shall inform my Fatherââmay be considered as equivalent to the Irish Brother.âThe menace in one case would imply a duel, in the other a law suit. Chorus. Notice is hereby given, To the deities of heaven; Not to trespass here, Upon our atmosphere; Take notice; from the present day, No smoke or incense is allow'd To pass this way. Peis.- Quite strange it is! quite unnaccountable! That herald to mankind, that was dispatch'd, What has become of him? He's not yet return'd. [Enter Herald.] Herald.- Oh Peisthetairus, happiest, wisest, best, Cleverest of men! Oh! most illustrious! Oh! most inordinately fortunate! Oh! most .... Oh! do for shame, do, bid me have done. Peis.- What are you saying? Her. âAll the people of Earth Have join'd in a complimentary vote, decreeing A crown of gold to you, for your exertions. Peis.- I'm much oblig'd to the people of Earth. But why? What was their motive? Her. âO most noble founder Of this supereminent celestial city, You can't conceive the clamour of applause, The enthusiastic popularity, That attends upon your name; th'impulse and stir, That moves among mankind, to colonize And migrate hither. In the time before, There was a Spartan mania, and people went Stalking about the streets, with Spartan staves, With their long hair, unwash'd and slovenly, Like so many Socrates's: but, of late, Birds are the fashionâBirds are all in allâ Their modes of life are grown to be mere copies Of the birds habits; rising with the lark, Scratching and scrabbling suits and informations; Picking and pecking upon points of law; Brooding and hatching evidence.âIn short, It has grown to such a pitch; that names of Birds Are given to individuals; ChÅrophon, Is called an Owl, Theagenes, a Goose, Philocles a Cock Sparrow, Midias, A Dunghill Cock.âAnd all the songs in vogue, Have something about Birds;âSwallows or Doves; Or about Flying,âor a Wish for Wings. Such is the state of things, and I must warn you, That you may expect to see some thousands of them Arriving here, almost immediately; With a clamorous demand for wings and claws: I advise you to provide yourself in time. Peis.- Come, it won't do then, to stand dawdling here; Go you, fill the hampers, and the baskets there With wings, and bid the loutish porter bring them, While I stop here, to encounter the new-comers. It has been already observed in reference to the Chorus of the AcharnÃ¦ (p. 58), that when his Chorus's have ceased to contribute to the progressive action of the Drama, the Poet has sometimes relieved himself, from the embarassment which they created, by turning into ridicule the essential character and attributes of the Chorus itself. In that Comedy, as in the present, the hostility of the Chorus had given spirit and animation to some of the earlier scenes, but, from the moment when their hostility ceased, they had remained a mere superfluous appendage;ânothing being left for them to be done, and scarcely any thing to be said; they could barely contrive to make their existence manifest from time to time by interposing with the expression of their acquiescence and approbation. The Poet then, having no further use for them, amuses his audience at their expense.âThe character of Chorus's (except when they happen to be in a violent passion) being habitually obsequious and conformable,â their obsequiousness is represented as connected with the display of DicÅopolis's good cheer, the sight of which confirms their favorable opinion of his political principles, and induces them to pass over his selfish treatment of the poor countryman with an apologetical observation. But with respect to the chorus now before us, (that of the Birds), there is another point of the choral character (arising out of the very condition of their existence as a chorus) which must not be overlooked.âAll Chorusses are essentially poetic and imaginative, the votaries of ideal harmony and beauty.âUnder this point of view, the following passage places them in amusing contrast with the practical active bustling spirit of Peisthetairus.âThe Chorus begin chaunting their namby pamby anticipations of future splendour and happiness. Peisthetairus, in the first instance, favouring them with a sort of gruff acquiescence.âBut as they proceed he loses all patience, contriving however to relieve himself, and give a vent to his ill humour, by scolding the servant.âThe obsequious character of the Chorus now displays itself; They affect to sympathize with his impatience; expressing their own displeasure, in a style suited to their choral character, that is to say, pedantic and formal.âPeisthetairus utterly disgusted with them, evades their sympathy, by relapsing into comparative good humour.âThe Chorus then betake themselves to their usual practice of exhorting and advising.âThis is more than he can endureâinstead of taking any notice of them, he flies into a pretended rage against his servant; and is running off the stage to beat him, when he is encountered by the first specimen of the new colonists. This explanation must not be regarded as fanciful or superfluous.âWe should in that case be compelled to adopt a conclusion, in which the admirers of Aristophanes would not readily acquiesce, namely, that the Poet had (in a play already of unusual length) inserted a passage of 24 lines destitute of poetical merit, without any comic intention and wholly unamusing as a dramatic exhibition. Peisthetairus says little in the following scene, but is not the less amusing, from his restless fidget and ill disguised impatience and disgust. Chorus. Shortly shall the noble town, Populous and gay, Shine in honour and renown.â Peis. â[dryly] Why perhaps she may. Chorus.- The benignant pow'rs of love, From their happy sphere, From the blest abodes above ... Peis. [venting his ill humour on the servant] Curse ye, rascal! can't ye move! Ch.- ... Are descending here, Where in all this earthly range, He that wishes for a change The chorus in their idealizing and poetical character. Can he find a seat, Joyous and secure as this, Fill'd with happiness and bliss, Such a fair retreat? Here are all the lovely faces, Gentle Venus and the Graces, And the little Cupid; Order, ease and harmony, Peace and affability. Peis.- The scoundrel is so stupid, Quicker, sirrah! bring it quicker! Ch.- Let him bring the woven wicker With the winged store. Chorus in their obsequious character but with a formal pedantic tone. I, myself, in very deed, With the varlet, will proceed, And smite him more and more; Like a sluggish ass he seems, Or even, as a man that dreams, Therefore smite him sore. Peis.- He's a lazy rogue it's true. Peisthetairus determined to cross them, relapses into good humour. Ch.- Now range them forth, display'd in order due, Feathers of every form and size and hue, With shrew'd intent, adapting every pinion, To the new residents of your dominion. The Chorus assume their admonitory character; Peisthetairus can bear it no longer; he breaks from them, and runs off the stage, as if to beat the servant. Peis.- I vow by the Hawks and Eagles! I won't bear it; I'll beat ye, I will myself, you lazy rascal! As a practical comment upon the anticipations of the Chorus, and as a sample of the kind of population likely to resort to a new colony; the first arrival is that of a young reprobate, who wishes his father out of the way; and, who conceives that the laws of the Birds will permit him to hasten that desirable conclusion. Peisthetairus receives and attends to him, without being betrayed into any expression of moral indignation, which would be inconsistent with his character, as a perfect politician. He merely states, as a matter of fact, some difficulties arising out of a point of law, professes a wish to serve him, as a hearty partizan, well disposed to the cause of the new colony; and finally, in an easy way, recalls to his recollection, one of the precepts of his Catechism; and, at the same time points out to him, a mode of life suited to his situation and tastes. The young man, who is more of a wild, desperate, than a confirmed villain, is struck with the suggestion, expresses a resolution to adopt it, and departs. Enter a fellow (singing). âOh! for an Eagle's force and might, From a Chorus of Sophocles; dramatic poetry and music was popular, like opera airs on the continent.âSee Knights, p. 43. âLoftily to soar âOver land and sea, to light âOn a lonely shore. Peis.- Well here's a song that's something to the purpose. Y. Man- Ay ay, there's nothing like itâwings and flying! Wings are your only sort. I'm a bird fancier. In the new-fashion quite. I've taken a notion To settle and live amongst ye. I like your laws. Peis.- What laws do you mean?âWe've many laws amongst us. Peisthetairus very gravely and methodically. Y. Man.- Your laws in general; but particularly The law that allows of beating one's own father. Peis.- Why truly, Yes! we esteem it a point of valour In a Chicken, if he clapperclaws the old Cock. Y. Man.- That was my view, feeling a wish in fact, To throttle mine, and seize the property. Peis.- Yes, but you'd find some difficulties here; Peisthetairus with great candour and composure simply stating a fact. An obstacle insurmountable, I conceive; An ancient statute standing unrepeal'd, Engrav'd upon our old Ciconian columns. It says; that when a Stork or a Ciconia Has brought his lawful progeny of young Storks To bird's estate, and enabled them to fly: The Sire shall stand entitled to a maintenance, At the son's cost, and charge in his old age. Y. Man. âI've manag'd finely it seems, to mend myself! Y. Man with a start of disappointment, slapping his forehead. Forc'd to maintain my father after all! Peis.- No no; not quite so bad; since you're come here; Peisthetairus in a soothing consolotary tone. As a well-wisher to the establishment, Zealous and friendly; we'll contrive to equip you With a suit of armour, as a soldier's orphan. The sons of citizens slain were publicly presented with a suit of armour. And now; young man; let me suggest some notions, Things, that were taught me when a boy.ââYour father?ââ A want of harmony in the original verse appears to indicate the insertion of a formulaâbut again if we resolve this formula into its two component parts the Question and Answer, with a consequent pause between them, the harmony of the verse is very sensibly improved. The formula was part of a series of moral prohibitions taught to children by Question and Answer. ââStrike him not,â!ârather take this pair of wings; And this cockspur; Giving him a sword. imagine, you've a coxcomb Upon your head, to serve you for a helmet; Look out for service, and enlist yourself; Get into a Garrison; live upon your pay; And let your father live.âYour're fond of fighting, And fond of flyingâtake a flight to Thrace; There you may please yourself; and fight your fill. Y. Man. âBy Jove, you're right.âThe notion's not a bad one. I'll follow it up! Peis.- [very gravely and quietly.] You'll find it the best way. [Exit Y. Man. Cinesias, a lame dithyrambic poet and musician, arrives in the hopes of being able to provide himself with wings, which will enable him too look after his concerns among the clouds, the great emporium for business with all persons, who are embarked in the dithyrambic line. Peisthetairus amuses himself with affronting and laughing at him, but he persists in his purpose, and professes his determination to continue worrying and persevering, till it is accomplished. The reader who refers to the original will perceive that the interruptions, with which Peisthetairus breaks in upon Cinesias's recitation or song, are omitted in the translation. To the Athenian audience, the original must have been familiar, and probably sufficiently hackneyed, to make them feel amusement at hearing it accompanied with burlesque interruptions: But as only one other fragment, of dithyrambic poetry has been preserved to modern times, and neither of them has appeared in our language, it seemed more adviseable to present it to the English reader in an unbroken form. It is singular that this other fragment presents the image of flying. Enter Cinesias, singing. âFearless, I direct my flight, âTo the vast Olympian height; âThence at random, I repair, âWafted in the whirling air; âWith an eddy, wild and strong, âOver all the fields of song. Peis.- Ah! well, Cinesias, I'm quite glad to see ye; But, what has brought ye and all your songs and music, Hobbling along with your old chromatic joints? Cin.- [singing.] âLet me live, and let me sing, âLike a bird upon the wing. Peis.- No more of that; but tell us plainly in prose, What are ye come for? what's your scheme, your object? Cin.- I was anxious to procure a pair of wings, To say the truth; wishing to make a tour Among the clouds, collecting images, And metaphors and things of that description. Peis.- How so! do you procure 'em from the clouds? Cin.- Entirely! Our dithyrambic business absolutely Depends upon them; our most approv'd commodities, The dusky misty, murky articles, With the suitable wings and feathers, are imported Exclusively from thence. I'll give you a sample, A thing of my own composing. You shall judge. Peis.- But indeed, I'd rather not. Cin. âBut indeed, you must; It's a summary view of flying, comprehending it In all its parts, in every point of view. Cinesias [singing.] âYe gentle feather'd tribes, âOf every plume and hue, âThat, in uninhabited air, âAre hurrying here and there; âOh! that I, like you, âCould leave this earthly level, âFor a wild aerial revel: âO'er the waste of ocean, âTo wander, and to dally âWith the billow's motion; âOr, in an eager sally, âSoaring to the sky, âTo range and rove on high âWith my plumy sails. âBuffeted and baffled, with the gusty gales, âBuffeted and baffled ...... [While Cinesias is repeating these last lines, Peisthetairus comes behind him, and gives him a flap with a huge pair of wings.] Cin.- A pretty civil joke indeed! Peis. âWhat joke? I'm only buffeting you with the plumy sails, I thought it was what you wanted. Cin. âWell that's fine! Pretty respect for a master such as me, A leader of the band, that all the tribes Are ready to fight for, to bespeak him first. Peis.- Well, we've a little unfledg'd chorus here, That Leotrophides Kinesias was ridiculed for his slight flimsy figure, adapted for flying! Leotrophides the Scholiast tells us, resembled him in this respect. hatch'd, poor puny nestlings, I'll give'em you for scholars. Cin. âAh laugh on! Laugh on! but take my word for it; Here I stay, Till you provide me with a pair of wings, Proper to circumnavigate the skies. [Exit Cin. Peisthetairus is represented in the following scene, as a perfect master of his art; amusing himself in angling and playing with a stupid impudent young scoundrel; sometimes twitching him in with a slight jerk of his hook, and again allowing him to run out to the full length of his line. If any one passage were to be selected from the remains of Aristophanes, as particularly illustrative of the manner in which he delights to exhibit character, perhaps it would be this; it is not a serious struggle for ascendancy, such as he displays elsewhere; in this instance, he shews Peisthetairus, as a consummate practitioner, relinquishing and re-assuming it at pleasure.âBut this is one of those scenes which, to be thoroughly appreciated, would require to be developed in dramatic action by a superior Comedian.âThe mere printed page, unless we suppose the reader to bestow as much attention on it, as an Actor would do in studying his part, will be found to convey a very confused and inadequate notion of it The song with which the Sycophant enters, is said by the scholiast to be from AlcÃ¦us; it should seem more consonant to his character, to suppose it to be some modern parody or adaptation from one of the comedies of the time. Enter, Sycophant (singing) âTell us, who the strangers are, âGentle Swallow. Birds of air, âParty-colour'd, poor and bare, âTell us, who the strangers are. Gentle Swallow, tell me true. Peis.- Here's a fine plague broke out. See yonder fellow Sauntering along this way, swaggering and singing. Syc.- Hoh! gentle Swallow! I say, my gentle Swallow, My gentle Swallow! How often must I call? An expression of impatience in the original has been hitherto mistranslated. Peis.- Why there, it is; the Prodigal in the Fable Seeking for Swallows in a ragged coat. Syc.- [in an arrogant overbearing tone.] Who's he, that's set to serve out wings? Where is he? Peis.- 'Tis I, but what do you want? You should explain. Syc.- Wings! Wings! You need not have ask'd me. Wings I want. Peis.- Do you mean to fly for flannel to Pellene? Pellene was famous for woollen stuff. Pieces of it were given as prizes at their public games. Syc.- [a little disconcerted at this allusion to his attire.] No, no! But I'm employ'd .. I employ myself In fact, among the allies, and islanders; I'm in the informing line. Peis.- [in a tone of very grave irony, which the Sycophant, not perceiving, proceeds more fluently than before.] I wish you joy. Syc.- And a mover and manager for prosecutions, In criminal suits, and so forth, you understand me; So, I wish to equip myself with a pair of wings, To whisk about, and trounce the islanders. Peis.- Would it be doing things in better form, To serve a summons flying, think ye? Syc.- [not knowing very well what to make of him.] No, Not that, but just to avoid the risk of pirates, To return in company with a flight of cranes, (As they do with the gravel in their gizzards) With a belly full of law suits, for my ballast. Peis.- [In a grave, primitive and somewhat twaddling tone, intended to re-animate the impertinence of the Sycophant] So, this is your employment! A young man Like you, to be an informer! Is it possible? Syc.- Why shou'd n't it? I was never bred to labour. Peis.- [As before] But sure, there are other lawful occupations, In which a brisk young fellow, such as you, Might earn an honest decent livelihood, In credit and good will, without informing. Syc.- [thoroughly taken in, and thinking he has to deal with a mere silly well meaning old man, becomes emphatically insolent.] Wings my good fellow!âwings I wantânot words! Peis.- [dryly] I'm giving you wings, already. Syc.- [a little puzzled and taken aback] What, with words? Is that your way? Peis.- [in a tone of very grave banter.] Yes, for mankind in general Are wing'd as it were, and brought to plume themselves In different ways by speeches and discourse. Syc.- [confused and puzzled.] What all? Peis.- [as before] Yes all. I'll give you a striking instance: You must have heard, yourself, elderly people Sitting conversing in the barber's shop. And one saysââWell Diittrephes has talk'd âSo much to my young man, he has brought him at last âTo plume himself in driving.â And another Says, that his son is quite amongst the clouds, Grown flighty of late, with studying tragedy. Syc.- [with a sort of hesitating laugh.] So, words are wings you say. Peis. âNo doubt of it. I say it, and I repeat it; human nature Is marvelously rais'd and elevated By words. I was in hopes, that I might raise you By words of good advice, to another sphere; To live in an honest calling. Syc.- [feeling himself banter'd, and beaten, but restive and angry.] But I won't though. Peis.- [coolly] Why, what will you do? Syc.- [sulkily at first, but animating as he proceeds.] Why, I wont disgrace my family, My father and my grandfather before him Serv'd as informers; and I'll stick to it, The profession.âSo, you'll please to hand 'em me out; A pair of your best wings, Vultures or Hawks, To fly to the Islands, with my summonses, And home again, to record them in the courts, And out again, to the Islands. Peis.- [in a tone of interest and sympathy, as if he was himself an amateur desirous of displaying his professional knowledge.] Yes, that's well, I understand ye, I think; your method is, To be beforehand with 'em? Your defendant, You get him cast for non-appearance, heh! Before he can arrive; and finish him In his absence, heh? Syc. â[completely taken in, delightedârubbing his hands.] By Jove, you're up to it! Peis.- Then, whilst he's sailing here you get the start, And fly, to pounce upon the property, To rummage out the chattels. Syc. âThat's the trick, The notion of it!âI see, you're up to it.â A man must whisk about, here and away, Just like a whipping top. Peis. âAy, yes, you're right, I understand youâThe instance is a good one.â A whipping top, you say.âWell, by good luck I've here a capital slashing suit of wings, To serve ye, made of a cow-hide from Corcyra. Syc.- Oh heaven! what's there? a horsewhip? Peis. âWings, I tell ye, To whisk ye about, to flog ye, and make ye fly. Syc.- Oh dear! oh dear! Peis. âScamper away, you scoundrel! Vanish you vagabond!âwhisk yourself off! I'll pay ye for your practices in the courts, Your pettifoggicorascalities. [Exit Syc. [to the attendants.] Come bundle up the wings. Let's take 'em back. [Exeunt. Fabulous notions, respecting the unknown portions of the world, seem to have been nearly the same (or at least of the same character) in the time of Aristophanes as in the days of Sir John Mandeville. The marvels of these regions, known only to the Birds, are naturally expatiated upon by a Chorus of Birds, when released from the business of the stage and placed in immediate communication with the audience. But it will be seen, that by a strange coincidence those wonderful and remote objects have an unaccountable analogy to things and persons at Athens; as in the following instance of the enormous Tree, which by the botanists was considered as belonging to the Sycophantic genus; but which was vulgarly called a Cleonymus, whereas at Athens there happened to be a person precisely of the same name, âCleonymus,â equally distinguished for his size; and having the same peculiarity of being classed among the Sycophants. And what is more singular; as the Athenian Cleonymus had lost his shield in battle, it so happened, that his vegetable counterpart was a deciduous tree, with leaves of a scutiform or shield-like shape, which it was also in the habit of losing. The antistrophe is a romantic and mysterious description of a junketing public house, which seems to have been in vogue; but from which it was not safe to return to town after dusk. Orestes, an heroic name, was also the name or the nickname of a noted robber (see AcharnÃ¦ p. 67). It was reckoned extremely dangerous to meet a demigod after sunset. Chorus. STROPHE. We have flown, and we have run, Viewing marvels, many a one; In every land beneath the sun. But, the strangest sight to see, Was a huge exotic tree, Growing, without heart or pith, Weak and sappy, like a wyth; But, with leaves and boughs withal, Comely, flourishing and tall. This the learned all ascribe To the Sycophantic tribe; But the natives there, like us, Call it a Cleonymus. In the spring's delightful hours, It blossoms with rhetoric flow'rs; I saw it standing in the field, With leaves, in figure like a shield; On the first tempestuous day, I saw it cast those leaves away. ANTISTROPHE. There lies a region out of sight, Far within the realm of night, Far from torch and candle light. There in feasts of meal and wine. Men and demigods may join, There they banquet, and they dine, Whilst the light of day prevails; At sun-set, their assurance fails. If any mortal then presumes, Orestes, sallying from the tombs, Like a fierce heroic sprite, Assaults and strips the lonely wight. The Scene which follows may be considered as a short abstract of the mode in which clandestine political information is received, attended to, and dismissed. The Informant presents himself with an extraordinary display of precaution and apprehension; he is received, with eagerness and cordiality; attended to, with great earnestness, interrupted only by some little ill-humour on the part of the man of business, when, in seeking for information, he is obliged to betray the want of it; finally, he is dismissed with a sort of indifference, approaching to derision, after having been thoroughly pumped and drained of his intelligence. Prometheus, Peisthetairus, Chorus. Pro.- [enters muffled up, peeping about him with a look of anxiety and suspicion.] Oh dear! If Jupiter should chance to see me! Where's Peisthetairus? Where? Peis. âWhy, what's all this? This fellow muffled up? Pro. âDo look behind me; Is any body watching? any Gods Following and spying after me? Peis. âNo, none, None that I see, there's nobody.âBut you! What are ye? Pro. âTell me, what's the time of day? Peis.- Why, noon, past noon; but tell me, who are ye? Speak. Pro.- Much past,âhow much? Peis.- [aside] Confound the fool, I say! The insufferable blockhead! Pro. âHow's the sky? Open or overcast? Are there any clouds? Peis.- [aloud and angrily] Be hang'd! Pro. âThen I'll disguise myself no longer. Peis.- My dear Prometheus! Pro. âHold your tongue, I beg; Don't mention my name! If Jupiter should see me, Or overhear ye, I'm ruin'd and undone. âBut now; To give you a full complete account Of every thing that's passing, there in Heav'n,â .... The present state of things. ... But first, I'll trouble you, To take the Umbrella; and hold it overhead, Lest they should overlook us. Peis. âWhat a thought! Just like yourself! A true Promethean thought! Stand under it, here! Speak boldly; never fear. Pro.- D'ye mind me? Peis. âYes, I mind ye; Speak away. Pro.- [emphatically] Jupiter's ruin'd. Peis. âRuin'd! How? Since when? Pro.- From the first hour you fortified and planted Your atmospheric settlements. Ever since, There's not a mortal offers any thing In the shape of sacrifice.âNo smoke of victims! No fumes of incense! Absolutely nothing! We're keeping a strict fastâfasting per force, From day to day,âthe whole community. And the Inland barbarous Gods in the upper country Are broken out, quite mutinous and savage, With hunger and anger; threat'ning to come down With all their force; if Jupiter refuses To open the Ports, and allow them a free traffic For their entrails and intestines, as before. Peis.- [a little annoyed at being obliged to ask the question] What .... are there other barbarous Gods, besides, In the upper country? Pro. âBarbarous?âto be sure! They're all of Execestides's kindred. Noted elsewhere in this play, as having no just claim to the rights of a citizen.âSee p. 6 and 43. Peis.- [as before hesitating, but with a sort of affected ease.] Well .... but .... the name now: These same barbarous deities .... .... What name, do you call'em? Pro. â[surprized at Peisthetairus's ignorance] Call them! The Triballi! Peis.- [giving vent to his irritation by a forced joke.] Ah! well then, that accounts for our old saying;â Confound the Tribe of them! Pro. â[annoyed and dryly] Precisely so. But, now to business. Thus much, I can tell ye; That Envoys will arrive immediately From Jupiter, and those upland wild Triballi, To treat for a peace. But, you must not consent To ratify or conclude; till Jupiter Acknowledges the sovereignty of the Birds; Surrendering up to you, the Sovereign Queen, Whom you must marry. Peis. âWhy what Queen is that? Pro.- What Queen?âA most delightful charming girl,â Jove's housekeeper, that manages his matters, Serves out his thunderbolts, arranges every thing; The constitutional laws and liberties, Morals and manners, the marine department, Freedom of speech, and Threepence for the Juries. -Peis. Why, that seems all in all. Pro. âYes, every thing I tell ye, in having her, you've every thing; I came down hastily, to say thus much; I'm hearty ye know; I stick to principle. Steady to the Human Interest,âalways was. Prometheus had incurred the wrath of Jupiter by his kindness to mankind in having bestowed on them the gift of fire. Peis.- Yes! we're oblig'd to you for our roast victuals. Pro.- And I hate these present Gods, you know, most thoroughly. I need not tell you that. Peis. â[with a sort of half sneer.] No, no, you need not, Peisthetairus, who has learned all that he wanted to know, does not care to lose his time, in listening to professions of zeal and attachment. He contrives however to conclude civilly, with a piece of obliging attention. You're known of old, for an enemy to the Gods. Pro.- Yes, yes, like Timon, I'm a perfect Timon; Just such another. But I must be going; Give me the umbrella; if Jupiter should see me, He'll think that I'm attending a procession, The CanÅphoroi were followed by a person bearing an umbrella and a folding chair. Peis.- That's well, but don't forget the folding chair, For a part of your disguise. Here, take it with you. [Exeunt. Under the same form of a description of the Wonders of the Terra Incognita, we have here again one of those pieces of personal satire peculiar to the ancient Comedy.â It is directed against Socrates and his school, including by name his friend ChÅrephon. The uncleanly habits imputed to them (âWhere Baths and washing are forbiddenâ) will have been seen already alluded to in p. 72, (âUnwash'd and slovenly like so many Socrates'sâ)âBut it is difficult to conceive what is the imputation conveyed, or alluded to, by describing them as engaged in the evocation of Spirits. It is a question, which might form a curious subject of enquiry for those who have the means of prosecuting it, and who are better acquainted with the History of the Socratic school. Pisander seems to have been an object of the Poet's peculiar aversion; in his first political Comedy, the Babylonians, he had been mentioned in company with two âTwoââFor by putting the participle in the dual, and transposing the verb and the proper name, the true metre of the fragment (the long AnapÃ¦st) may be restored. others, as having given occasion to the origin of the war, by their extorsion of compulsory presents from the subject states, an accusation which is repeated in the Lysistrata, v. 490; again in the Peace, v. 396, his military pomp and arrogance are mentioned as objects of extreme disgust and contempt; and it seems that he must have been the Commander described at length in the Epirrema of the same Comedy, most splendidly caparisoned and foremost in running away.âHe had also been stigmatized by Eupolis as having been guilty of cowardly conduct. It seems that he is brought in here, by the bye, not as a follower or disciple of Socrates, but in allusion to his want of military courage, as a person whose spirit wanted to be raised, and who therefore naturally resorted to a place where Spirits were raised. ChÅrephon was the most zealous admirer of Socrates, he is recorded to have been a person of most singular aspect. Chorus. Beyond the navigable seas, Amongst the fierce Antipodes, There lies a lake, obscure and holy, Lazy, deep, and melancholy, Solitary, secret, hidden, Where baths and washing are forbidden. Socrates, beside the brink, Summons from the murky sink Many a disembodied ghost; And Pisander reach'd the coast, To raise the spirit, that he lost; With a victim, strange and new, A simile by juxtaposition indirectly expressed as when Adam is described tall and fair beneath a palm tree and the gigantic warriors in Homer standing before the lofty gates. The indirect simile may be either beautiful or sublime, or as in the present instance ludicrous. A gawky Camel, which he slew Like UlyssesâWhereupon, The grizzly sprite of ChÅrephon Flitted round him; and appear'd With his eyebrows and his beard, Like a strange infernal fowl, Half a Vampyre, half an Owl. It is usual with Aristophanes to omit that explanation, which a poet of the new comedy would have put into a soliloquy, or into a confidential conversation between the master and his slave. He gives his audience credit for being able to comprehend, at once, the previous views of the person whom he introduces. Neptune, the chief of the Embassy, in which Hercules and the barbarous Triballian Deity are joined with him, has settled in his own mind a very satisfactory plan for the management of it. âHercules is my nephew; and of course looks up to me. He will be easily managed, if I can appear to consult and advise exclusively with him. But I must begin by putting the Triballian wholly out of the question, as a ragamuffin, whom we are both equally ashamed of. Otherwise, their understandings are so much upon a par, my poor nephew, I am sorry to say, is such a blockhead, that he and that beast, the Triballian, from the mere natural sympathy of their stupidity, will join and act together in spite of me.ââHe accordingly begins with the Triballian, by settling his dress for him, and as soon as he has disposed of him, and set him down, as an unproduceable ruffian, he turns round to consult Hercules; who makes a stupid answer.âNeptune, like a kind uncle, endeavours quietly and calmly to set him right. Up to this point every thing appears promising; but Neptune, alas! is deficient in presence of mind; he is encumbered with his dignity: and above all, in the person of Peisthetairus, he is opposed to a politician, infinitely his superior in resources and address.âThey advance within sight of Peisthetairus, who affects, not to notice them, and remains looking down among the dishes, apparently occupied with his sauces.âNeptune, of course, advances no farther; but remains with a decided attitude and look of dignity, ready to meet his eye, as soon as it shall be rais'd to encounter his. Unfortunately however, he is so much occupied with his own attitude, and with the look which seems to sayââWell Sir, now you're at leisure,ââthat he omits to restrain Hercules, who, more impatient and indignant, presses forward with an announcement of their arrival, calculated, as he thinks, to rouse and astonish Peisthetairus: failing in his attempt to make an impression, and feeling himself at a loss, he remains exposed to the influence of his natural instincts, which attract him towards the pans and dishes.â Hence, a conversation is begun, a recognition takes place,âthe ice is broken, and the negotiation opened; while Neptune is left with his dignity in the back ground. Neptune, the Triballian Envoy, Hercules. Nep.- There's Nephelococcugia, that's the town, The point we're bound to, with our embassy. [turning to the Triballian] But you! What a figure have ye made yourself! What a way to wear a mantle! slouching off From the left shoulder! Hitch it round, I tell ye, On the right side. For shame,âcome,âso; that's better, These folds too, bundled up.âThere, throw them round Even and easy,âso.âWhy, you're a savage, A natural born savage.âOh! democracy! What will it bring us to? when such a ruffian Is voted into an embassy! Tri.- [to Neptune who is pulling his dress about.] Come, hands off! Hands off! Nep. âKeep quiet, I tell ye, and hold your tongue, For a very beast; in all my life in heaven, I never saw such another.âHercules, I say, what shall we do? What should you think? Her.- What would I do? What do I think? I've told you Already ... I think to throttle himâthe fellow, Whoever he is, that's keeping us blockaded. Nep.- Yes, my good friend; but we were sent, you know, To treat for a Peace. Our embassy is for peace. Her.- That makes no difference; or if it does, It makes me long to throttle him the more. Peis.- [very busy, affecting not to see them.] Give me the Silphium spice.âWhere's the cheese grater? Bring cheese here, sombody! Mend the charcoal fire. Her.- Mortal, we greet you and hail you! Three of us. Three deitiesâ Peis. â[without looking up] But I'm engag'd at present; A little busy, you see, mixing my sauce. Her.- Why sure! How can it be? what dish is this? Birds seemingly! Peis. â[without looking up] Some individual birds, Oppos'd to the popular democratic birds, Render'd themselves obnoxious. Her. âSo, you've pluck'd them, And put them into sauce, provisionally? Peis.- [looking up] Oh! bless me, Hercules, I'm quite glad to see you. What brings you here? Her. âWe're come upon an embassy From Heaven, to put an end to this same War. ... Serv.- [to Peisthetairus] The cruet's empty, our oil is out. Peis. âNo matter, Fetch more, fetch plenty, I tell ye. We shall want it. Her.- ... For, in fact it brings no benefit to us, The continuance of the War prolonging it; And you yourselves, by being on good terms Of harmony with the Gods ... why, for the future, You'd never need to know, the want of rain, For water in your tanks; and we could serve ye With reasonable, seasonable weather, According as you wish'd it, wet or dry. And this is our commission coming here, As Envoys, with authority to treat. Peis.- Well, the dispute, you know, from the beginning, Did not originate with us. The War (If we could hope in any way to bring you To reasonable terms) might be concluded. Our wishes, I declare it; are for Peace. If the same wish prevails upon your part; The arrangement in itself, is obvious.â âA retrocession on the part of Jupiter.â The Birds, again to be reintegrated In their estate of sovereignty.âThis seems The fair result; and if we can conclude, I shall hope to see the ambassadors to supper. Her.- Well, this seems satisfactory; I consent. Nep.- [To Hercules.] What's come to ye? What do ye mean? Are ye gone mad? You Glutton; would you ruin your own father, Depriving him of his ancient sov'reignty? Peis.- [to Neptune] Indeed!âAnd would not it be a better method Peisthetairus with the civil good humoured sneer of a superior understanding. For all you Deities, and confirm your power; To leave the Birds to manage things below? You sit there, muffled in your clouds above, While all mankind are shifting, sculking, lurking, And perjuring themselves here out of sight. Whereas, if you would form a steady strict Alliance with the Birds, when any man (Using the common old familiar oathâ âBy Jupiter and the crowâ) See p. 29 and note. foreswore himself, The Crow would pick his eyes out, for his pains. Nep.- Well, that seems plausibleâthat's fairly put. Her.- I think so, too. Peis.- [to the Triballian] Well, what say you? Trib. âSay true. It is singular, that these two syllables, are the last syllables of the word (or sentence), in his own language, by which the Triballian expresses his consent. Peis.- Yes. He consents you see! But I'll explain now Peisthetairus very volubly,âquite at his ease. The services and good offices we could do you. Suppose a mortal made a vow, for instance, To any o'You; then he delays and shuffles, And says âThe Gods are easy creditors.â In such a case, we could assist ye, I say, To levy a fine. Nep. â[open to conviction, but anxious to proceed on sure ground.] How would you do it? Tell me. Peis.- Why, for example, when he's counting money, Or sitting in the bath, we give the warrant To a poursuivant of ours, a Kite or Magpie; And they pounce down immediately, and distrain Cash or apparel, money or money's worth, To twice the amount of your demand upon him. Her.- Well, I'm for giving up the sovereignty, For my part. Nep. â[convinced, but wishing to avoid responsibility, by voting last] The Triballian, what says he? Her.- [aside to the Triballian shewing his fist.] You, Sir; do you want to be well bang'd or not? Mind, how you vote! Take care, how you provoke me. Trib.- Yaw, yaw. Goot goot. Her. âHe's of the same opinion. Nep.- Then, since you're both agreed, I must agree. Her. â[shouting to Peisthetairus, the negotiators having withdrawn to consult at the extremity of the stage] Well, you! We've settled this concern, you see, About the Sovereignty; we're all agreed. Peis.- Oh faith, there's one thing more, I recollect, Before we part; a point that I must mention. As for dame Juno, we'll not speak of her; I've no pretensions, Jupiter may keep her; But, for that other Queen, his manager, The sovereign Goddess, her surrender to me, Is quite an Article indispensable. Nep.- Your views, I find, are not dispos'd for peace: Neptune with gravity &amp; dignity We must turn homewards. Peis. âAs you please, so be it.â Cook, mind what you're about there with the sauce; Let's have it rich and savory, thicken it up! Her.- How now, man? Neptune! are you flying off? Must we remain at war, here, for a woman? Nep.- But, what are we to do? Her. âDo? Why, make peace. Nep.- I pity you really! I feel quite asham'd Neptune in great wrath like a grave Uncle scolding a great fool of a Nephew. And sorry to see you; ruining yourself! If any thing should happen to your father, After surrendering the sovereignty, What's to become of you? When you yourself Have voted away your whole inheritance: At his decease, you must remain a beggar. Peis.- [aside to Hercules] Ah there! I thought so; he's coming over ye; Step here, a moment! Let me speak to ye! Your Uncle's chousing you, my poor dear friend, You've not a farthing's worth of expectation, From what your father leaves. Ye can't inherit By law: ye're illegitimate ye know. Her.- Heighday! Why, what do you mean? Peis. âI mean the Fact! Your Mother was a foreigner; Minerva Is counted an heiress, every body knows; How could that be, supposing her own father To have had a lawful heir? Her. âBut, if my Father Should choose to leave the property to me, In his last Will. Peis. âThe law would cancel it! And Neptune he that's using all his influence To work upon ye; he'd be the very first To oppose ye, and oust ye, as the testator's brother. I'll tell ye, what the law says, Solon's law: âA foreign heir shall not succeed, Memory must have been in the earliest times the sole repository of knowledge of every kind.âEvery means therefore of assistance to the memory was most carefully cultivated.âAmongst other instances, in order to facilitate the requisite knowledge and recollection of them, the Laws themselves were composed and recorded in a metrical form.âHence the same word in Greek signifies both a Song and a Law. âWhere there are children of the lawful breed: âBut, if no native heir there be, âThe kinsman nearest in degree âShall enter on the property.â Her.- Does nothing come to me then?âNothing at all, Of all my father leaves? Peis. âNothing at all, I should conceive.âBut you perhaps can tell me. Did He, your Father, ever take ye with him, To get ye enroll'd upon the register? Her.- No truly, I ... thought it strange, ... he ... never did. Peis.- Well, but don't think things strange. Don't stand there, stammering, Puzzling and gaping. Trust yourself to me, 'Tis I must make your fortune after all! If you'll reside and settle amongst us here, I'll make you chief Commander among the Birds, Captain, and Autocrat and every thing. Here you shall domineer and rule the roast, With splendour and opulence and pigeon's milk. Her.- [in a more audible voice, and in a formal decided tone. They had withdrawn apart, and their previous conversation was supposed not to have been audible to Neptune and the Triballian, whose bye-play might have consisted in Neptune's formal attempts to soothe and gain the Triballian, who would only shrug up his shoulders.] I agreed with you before: I think your argument Unanswerable. I shall vote for the surrender. Peis.- [to Neptune] And what say you? Nep.- [firmly and vehemently.] Decidedly I dissent. Peis.- Then it depends upon our other friend, It rests with the Triballian, what say you? Tri.- Me tell you; pretty girl, grand beautiful Queen, Give him to Birds. Her. âAye, give her up, you mean. Nep.- Mean! He knows nothing about it. He means nothing But chattering like a Magpie. Peis. âWell âThe Magpiesâ Peisthetairus being sure of his point, amuses himself with arguing nonsensically to provoke Neptune. He means, the Magpies or the Birds in general. The Republic of the Birdsâtheir governmentâ That the surrender should be made to them. Nep.- [in great wrath.] Well, settle it yourselves; amongst yourselves; In your own style: I've nothing more to say. Her.- [to Peisthetairus.] Come, we're agreed in fact, to grant your terms; But you must come, to accompany us to the sky; To take back this same Queen, and the other matters. Peis.- [very quietly.] It happens lucky enough, with this provision For a marriage feast. It seems prepar'd on purpose. Her.- Indeed, and it does. Suppose in the meanwhile, I superintend the cookery, and turn the roast, While you go back together. Nep.- [with a start of surprise and disgust.] Turn the roast!! A pretty employment! Won't you go with us? Her.- No thank ye; I'm mighty comfortable here. Peis.- Come, give me a marriage robe; I must be going. We have here another satyric Song, of the same fanciful humour as the preceding, descriptive of imaginary wonders in an unknown world. In the last instance the Poet had exhibited a caricature of the Socratic school of Philosophy.âThe same vein of ridicule is now directed against another novelty, tending equally, in the opinion of the Poet (more just in this than in the preceding instance) to produce an undesirable change in the general character of the nation. Mercenary professors and teachers of Rhetoric, for the most part foreigners (the Gorgias for instance here mentioned was a Sicilian), had of late been received and encouraged in Athens. Their public exhibitions, which were generally resorted to, had operated as an incentive to the natural propensity of the Athenian people, already more than enough disposed to divert their attention to the unproductive pursuits of litigation and speechifying.âWhile at the same time their Private Lessons (the course of Instruction by which they engaged to communicate the secrets of their art, and to form young practitioners) were purchased in some instances at an enormous price, by young men of wealth aspiring to political eminence and celebrity. Chorus. Along the Sycophantic shore, And where the savage tribes adore The waters of the Clepsydra, The Clepsydra or Water Clock marked the time allotted to each Advocate. It was a prominent object in the Courts of Justice. The name also belonged to certain streams and springs. There dwells a nation, stern and strong, Arm'd with an enormous tongue, Wherewith, they smite and slay: Dangerous as accusers. With their tongues, they reap and sow, And gather all the fruits Their salaries and profits. that grow, The vintage and the grain; Gorgias is their Chief of pride, And many more there be beside Of mickle might and main. Good they never teach, nor shew But how to work men harm and woe, Unrighteousness and wrong; And hence, the custom doth arise, When beasts are slain in sacrifice, We sever out the tongue. This sacrificial form was peculiar to the Athenians. It has been already observed, that this play, in the success of which, as a sedative to the popular insanity, the higher orders of the community were essentially interested, was exhibited with a singular recklessness of expense. The concluding Scene seems to have been equal in magnificence to those of the most gorgeous Tragedies; and it is remarkable that in the passage immediately following, contrary to the invariable custom of the Poet, there is no tinge of burlesque. The Poet has throughout, as a Poet, imitated the style of Sophocles; while under his direction, as the manager of a Comic Drama, the Actor who personated Peisthetairus, must have been instructed to reduce the Scene to the level of Comedy, by his airs and gestures characteristic of unaccustomed dignity and authority.âIt must have been a very delicate and amusing piece of acting! An elderly man, a sharp thorough going fellowâto see him Assume the God, Affect to nod, And seem to shake the spheres! The Choral songs which follow are of a peculiar and by no means obvious character, which it is rather difficult to define, and not very easy to express in imitation. In the Comedy of the Peace we have a rustic Epithalamium, perfectly rustic, and probably not very different from the rustic extempore Poetry of the same race at the present day.âBut in this instance we have a Town Epithalamium, such as we may suppose to have been composed and perpetrated in honor of the nuptials of the more noble and wealthy families in Athens. The vulgar town Poet is anxious to exhibit his education by imitating and borrowing passages from the most approved lyrical poets, but at the same time reduces all their imagery and expressions to the natural level of his own dullness.âThus maintaining, in the verse itself, that balance of the ludicrous and sublime, which in the first part of the scene had resulted from the contrast of the Poetry and the Action. Some parts of the Epithalamium of Catullus (See v. 100 and the following stanzas) are evidently a humorous imitation of the vulgar Epithalamia at Rome.âUnder cover of this character, he amused himself at the expense of his new married friends. Harbinger or Herald, announcing the approach of Peisthetairus. O fortunate! O triumphant! O beyond All power of speech or thought, supremely blest, Prosperous happy Birds!âBehold your King, Here in his glorious palace!âMark his entrance, Dazzling all eyes, resplendent as a Star; Outshining all the golden lights, that beam From the rich roof, even as a summer Sun, Or brighter than the Sun, blazing at Noon. He comes; and at his side a female form Of beauty ineffable; wielding on high, In his right hand, the winged thunderbolt, Jove's weapon.âWhile the fumes of incense spread Circling around, and subtle odours steal Upon the senses from the wreathed smoke, Curling and rising in the tranquil air. See there He stands! Now must the sacred Muse Give with auspicious words her welcome due. Semichorus. Stand aside and clear the ground, Spreading in a circle round With a worthy welcoming; To salute our noble King In his splendor and his pride, Coming hither, side by side, With his happy lovely bride. O the fair delightful face! What a figure! What a grace! What a presence! What a carriage! What a noble worthy marriage. Let the Birds rejoice and sing, At the wedding of the King: Happy to congratulate Such a blessing to the state. Hymen Hymen Hoh! Jupiter, that God sublime, When the Fates, in former time, Match'd him with the Queen of Heaven, At a solemn banquet given, Such a feast was held above; And the charming God of Love, Being present in command, As a Bridesman took his stand, With the golden reins in hand. Hymen Hymen Hoh! Peis.- I accept and approve the marks of your love, Peisthetairus puts an end to their nonsense with condescension and affability. Your music and verse I applaud and admire. But rouse your invention, and raising it higher, Describe me the terrible engine of Jove, The thunder of Earth and the thunder above. The Reader may have already observed, that in more than one instance the Poet directs the attention of his Audience to the lavish expenditure of the Choregus. This seems to have been the object of the following lines, introductory to a new display of theatrical thunder manufactured upon an improved principle. Chorus. O dreaded Bolt of Heaven, The Clouds with horror cleaving, And ye terrestrial thunders deep and low Clos'd in the subterranean caves Caves of the Theatre. below, That even at this instant growl and rage, Shaking with awful sound this earthly stage; Our King by you has gain'd his due; By your assistance, yours alone, Every thing is made his own, Jove's dominion and his throne; And his happiness and pride, His delightful lovely bride. Hymen Hymen Hoh! Peisthetairus. Birds of ocean and of air, Hither in a troop repair, To the royal ceremony, Our triumphant matrimony! Come for us to feast and feed ye! Come to revel dance and sing!â Lovely creature! Let me lead ye Hand in hand, and wing to wing. FINIS.</field>
