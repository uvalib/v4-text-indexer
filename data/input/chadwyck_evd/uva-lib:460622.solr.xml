      <field name="fulltext">JESUS OF NAZARETH A TRAGEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO MY FRIEND AND BROTHER POET GEORGES LEFÃVRE THE AUTHOR OF THAT EXQUISITE POEM âLE FAUNEâ THIS WORK IS AFFECTIONATELY AND ADMIRINGLY DEDICATED</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRELUDE. Through many a starless night of endless time Those far-off souls have slept, who strove and fell Round Jesus battling in the far-off clime Whence first shone forth our heaven, flared forth our hell. But now I bid the sleeping souls awake; I draw them forth from their dim priest-closed tomb: Man hears again the true sweet words they spake And sees once more love's flowers in earliest bloom. Those far-off souls were human even as we; They spake no language mystic or profound: No pulpit's shadow darkened Galilee; They heard as yet no godless sermon's sound. Their hands were filled with no celestial flowersâ Nay, passion shook them with its stormy might: Their hearts were gladdened through the morning's hours, Chilled at the sunset, saddened at the night. Their Jesus swayed them even as mightiest Lord Because he loved with human love and deep: Jesus, no crowned Messiah, they adored; Man's eyes, not God's, on Calvary closed in sleep. Man, in some strange unknown sweet fashion, rose; Man's heart through man's lips breathed the immortal tale: Not God but man beyond death's deep repose Reached that far shore no winds nor waves assail. Man's was the sorrow, man's the triumph too, Aye man's and woman'sâthis the poet sees: For him Gennesareth's waters still are blue; Still bloom the undying flowers, the unfading trees. Where Churches cannot tread, the poet goes: The gates no Churches open, open wide Before him; Jesus' inmost heart he knows Because he seeks that heart with love, not pride. He hears the words that early lovers spake: He hears, though dark sad ages loom between, Fisher to fisher shouting on the Lake; He sees the brown eyes of the Magdalene. He sees the Jesus whom the Church has slainâ Then, with the eternal pity in his heart, Wipes from the sacred brow the last blood-stain And saves the saviour by redemptive Art. He says, undoubting, with strong heart made clear Because the love of truth within it lies, To Jesus stricken to death by Christian's spear, âThou Son of man, I say unto thee, âAriseâ!â</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act I. The Mother. Scene I. By the fountain in the market-place of Nazareth. Four girls, Rebecca, Miriam, Michal, Leah, are conversing and filling their pitchers at the fountain. Michal. Have you seen Mary lately? Leah. No: she is entirely taken up with her own thoughts now. She seems far too proud to condescend to our company. Michal. Indeed! And I remember her such an ugly little thing! Miriam. You remember her as a baby? You must be old then! Michal. You know I didn't mean that. You are too ready with your tongue, Miriam. Rebecca. I think I see her in the distance, coming through that corn-field Miriam. When she comes, we will tease her finely! Leah. Yes: ask her what a poet is. Lately she talks of nothing but poets and poetry. (Enter Mary). Rebecca. Mary, we want to know what a poet is? Mary. Jesus is a poet. I love poets! Michal. But what are poets? What can they do? Mary. Everything. Miriam. Can they give girls beautiful dresses? Mary. No: but they can bring the stars to the earth, and fill the wintriest day with sunshine Jesus' thoughts are oftener in the stars than on the earth, I fancy. Leah. Well, I shouldn't like a man of that sort for a husband. Mary. Poets don't make good husbands. They are far nicer as lovers. All four girls together. Mary, we are shocked at you! Michal. Poets write verses, don't they? Miriam. Oh, does Jesus write poetry? My Zeno can do that! He wrote the loveliest poem you ever saw the other dayâall about my eyes. Rebecca. Well, if I had been Zeno, I would have found something better than that to write about. Mary. Than that!âyou talk as if poor Miriam had only one eye. But noâJesus does not write poetry. He does better; he lives it. Leah. How do you mean? Mary. I mean thisâthat instead of thinking only of himself and his own feelings, he is always thinking of others. Leah. Oh. Mary. Yes: he lives a beautiful life. That is the best sort of poem. He reads to old blind, or nearly blind, people; he visits and comforts the suffering; he heals the sick. Miriam. Oh, I have heard all about that. He performs miracles, does he not?âjust as old Benjamin who lived in that lonely cottage used to do, only old Father Benjamin's miracles were much more amusing. I have seen him change a walking-stick into a puppy dog. Rebecca. Old Manasseh Levi, who lives by the mud-pond at Bethsaida, can do more wonderful things still. Did you hear of his changing the fish into a dragon? Miriam. Father Benjamin has a magic ring, and he can draw devils out of people's noses. Rebecca. Old Manasseh drove a devil out of a young girl, and in passing out it upset a statue. Michal. Jesus fed five thousand people the other day with five loaves and two fishes, and there were twelve baskets full of fragments left. Miriam. Silly! You have got it all wrong. There were seven loaves and a few little fishes, and there were four thousand people. My brother Isaac was there, and he told me all about it. He counted the baskets of bitsâthere were seven of them. Rebecca. The wine at Cana was the most wonderful. How many gallons did Jesus make? Leah. A hundred and fifty-six. Miriam. Enough, in all conscience. Rebecca. Not too much. Remember your Zeno was there. Miriam. Be quiet. Mary. I think we are all talking rather foolishly. Let us fill our pitchers and move on. Michal (thoughtfully). If Jesus were here, he could change this fountain into wine! Mary. He would not do that. He does not do useless or foolish things. Miriam. Oh, never mind Jesus! I like bright-eyed Zeno much better. Rebecca. You are wrong. Jesus is very beautiful; so beautiful that he sometimes looks almost like a woman. He has the purest, most transparent skin I ever saw in a manâfair, not like a Jew's. All the men about here have dark eyes and hairâhow sick I am of seeing itâwhat is the use of a man, if he is just like oneself? Jesus has eyes like the blue sky and hair as golden as the sunlight. His voice is full of sweetness, and his eyes are full of dreams. Miriam. Zeno's eyes are full of fun. Rebecca. Zeno's coat is full of holes. Mary (stooping down to fill her pitcher). Don't let us quarrelâleast of all, about Jesus. Michal (aside to the others). She loves him! (They fill their pitchers, and begin moving away from the spot). Rebecca. Mary, before we go, will you not sing us that new song of yours? You know the one I meanâthe one you were singing the other day, when I met you coming to the fountain. The other three girls. Yes, Mary, sing. The sun is scorching; let us rest here in the shade a little longer. (Mary sings). Oh, well I love all gracious things, The sunshine soft and fairâ I love the rustle of bright birds' wings, The breath of the summer air: I love the morning mist on the lake, The flowers on hill and plain; God made gold flowers for a girl to take, While man seeks gold for gainâ God made gold flowers for a girl to take, While man seeks gold for gain, for gain, While man seeks gold for gain! Oh, better I love all gracious words, The light in young men's eyes, Their voices sweeter than songs of birds, Love's laughter, and love's sighs. 'Tis well while life is young, is young, To let all sad things be, To leave no golden songs unsung For golden days must fleeâ To leave no golden songs unsung For the golden days must flee, must flee, For the golden days must flee! (She pauses; then continues in a softer tone). But best I love, when all is done, When passionate longings cease, The light that shall outlive the sun, The love that bringeth peace. Oh, gaily I'll love gay generous hearts, Then fling those hearts aside, And, having played a hundred parts, I'll play the part of brideâ Yes, having broken a hundred hearts, I'll be in the end a bride, a bride, A pure and loving bride! (When she has finished, the girls all clap their hands). Rebecca. When I hear that voice of yours, Mary, I forget everything. The men will find out the charm of it some dayâif indeed they have not already done so. Leah. She sings beautifully. How I wish I could sing like that! Michal. Oh, you can only croak. Miriam. Did Jesus write that song? Mary. No. It is getting lateâlet us be going. (Exeunt Mary and the girls, Mary somewhat silent, the GIRLS laughing and chattering). Scene II. A room in Joseph's cottage at Nazareth. Mary the mother of Jesus, Joseph, the Rabbi Ben-Aaron, Mary Magdalene, engaged in conversation. Mary the Mother (to Ben-Aaron). We need your help, for we have anxious hearts. Joseph. The youth's a noble youth, but there are now Strange rumours in the air; the thoughts of men Are all unsettled. Some predict the end: The book of Daniel has convulsed the nation: These Messianic dreams have reached the ears Of Jesus, touched his youthful heart to flame; We dread the future. Ben-Aaron. Can I be of service? Mary the Mother. Your wondrous learning and your gentle heart May be of priceless service. We are folk Unlearned, simpleâJesus hardly deigns To listen to our protests. He will hear Your words. Mary Magdalene (aside). His words will be as idle waves That beat against the blue lake's rocky shore, Yet fret not even a pebble. I know Jesus. Ben-Aaron. I'll do my utmost to convince your son That in the old-fashioned paths lie peace and safety âOnce young, I now am old,â as David says, âYet saw I never any righteous man Who held to the old true faith, forlorn, forsaken.â When Moses' Law with its far-seeing gaze Ordained that any, be he poor or rich, Who contravened its mandates should be stoned, Stoned without trial, was its edict harsh? Nay, nowise harshâbut simply, nobly, just; Aye, more than this, our nation's best defence Against false teachers. Mary Magdalene (aside). Would they stone him then? If a stone crushed that white pure brow of his, Myself would stone the stoner. (Aloud) Do you hold That thinkers should be stoned? Ben-Aaron. Yes, when their thought Wanders in reinless freedom far beyond The bounds prescribed. Thought's mountains may be climbed By cultured men and learned in the land, Not by the unlearned folk of Galilee. Joseph. You speak true wisdom's words; with all my heart I do assent to all that you have said. He may need much convincingâhe's surrounded, I grieve to say it, by a crowd of men Whose hearts are fed with wildest hopes, whose brains Are none too soundâthe least mad is Iscariot. Andrew and Peterâthey are honest fishers, Their father was my friendâbut James and John, âThe sons of thunderâ as the people call them, They are young fiery revolutionists, They'll lead my son towards danger; John believes That Daniel spoke the very, literal, truth And that 'mid flame and blood and wildest woes The Son of God will come to rule the earth. Philip is John the Baptist's staunch disciple: He will plant deep the Baptist's wild ideas In Jesus' brainâhe's ever urging him To seek out John on Jordan's rocky banks And to submit to be baptised of him. Ben-Aaron. Well, if he went, it might not all be ill. (Aside) The thing might serve my purpose. (Aloud) If he went, That hideous desert where John holds his own, Being as it is the dreariest loneliest spot In all the world, might rouse in Jesus' mind Swift healthier yearning for the flower-filled vales Of this our fair and fertile Galilee. Mary Magdalene. Are John the Baptist's followers men alone? Do women seek the desert? Ben-Aaron. Some there are, Mere worthless hussies who upon the sand Writhe in convulsions at the prophet's feet. Mary Magdalene. Jesus loves flowers and sunshine and the clear Blue cloudless skies, or better still the nights Alive with stars, of this our Galilee. That desert will not suit himâ(aside) nor me either. Ben-Aaron (to Mary Magdalene). Now, if you'll lead the wayâyou know the haunts Of Jesusâ Mary Magdalene. He is resting in the groveâ Ben-Aaron. I'll do my best to draw him gently round To wiser happier views of men and things. Joseph and Mary the Mother (together). Our heartiest thanks to you! Ben-Aaron. Nay, thank me not. Such business is a pleasureâ(aside) as it is, For it shall serve my pleasure. Mary Magdalene. Follow me. (Exeunt Ben-Aaron and Mary Magdalene). Joseph (looking after them). There goes a good old man, and with him goes A right good maidenâgood as she is fair. Mary the Mother. Goodâyesâbut somewhat flighty. As for him, Ben-Aaron, I could trust him with my soul. What a strange face and figureâslightly bent, Stooping with grand superb proud dignity; That reverend brow, so worn with lofty thought; The mouth, so gentle and so passionless, Round which a smile perpetual softly plays; And then the eyes, so full of far-off dreamsâ Eyes which see God, and understand the stars And all the stars' dim secretsâwhat a man! They say he's learned past all comprehension, Nothing there is Ben-Aaron does not know, So gossip has itâand I think indeed That gossip in this for once is wholly right. They say that curious mystic ruby ring On his forefinger that he always wears Was seen to flash its rays from Moses' hand When he descended from Mount Sinai. Joseph. Ahâdo they say so? 'Tis a wondrous ring: I can believe the story. Mary. There they go! Rounding that corner, 'mid the trees they'll find Our son. Joseph. I trust Ben-Aaron will convince him. Mary. A curious coupleâMary, full of youth And girlish sweetness, pacing by the side Of wisdom here incarnate. She is safe With him as with an angel. Joseph. Far more safe, If some old tales be true! But let's be going. (Exeunt Joseph and Mary the Mother). Scene III. In a wood near Joseph's house. Jesus and his Mother conversing. Jesus. You see the present, and the past still weighs Heavy upon you, but before my eyes Spreads wide and clear the future of our race. Think'st thou that God alone to Abraham spoke, To Moses and Eliasânot to me? Because thy pure blood courses through my veins Think'st thou that God's eternal fatherhood Will never claim its own, that through my eyes Will never flash forth on the sons of men My Father's undisputed majesty? Woman, thou errest: by the laws o' the flesh From thee I drew my life, this body of mine, This human visible frame, to thee I owe, But yet in other spheres my spirit breathed Long ere my body quickened in thy womb. Yea, from God's life my higher life I drew; His royal blood flows tingling through my veins, And when I see injustice, hate, or wrong, I speak as I have heard my Father speak, His holy anger lightens from my soulâ Just as his pity thrills me, when I see The ceaseless silent suffering of the world. Mary. I search the scriptures patiently, my son. What has been written by the hand of God In those our priceless scriptures, I believe. Upon the impregnable rock of holy writ I standâ Jesus. I stand upon the impregnable rock Of mine own soul. Mary. Beware of blasphemy. Jesus. No prophet ever yet spake to the world Words fresh from God's lips but the world accused That seer of blasphemy. Mary. The prophets spake As God inspired themâthou dost speak not thus. In thy presumption thou wouldst quite undo The work of ages, set thyself above Isaiah, Moses, Micah, thou a youth Full of high thoughts, but inexperienced, weak As yet in power to grasp the truth of things. Jesus. I am the truth. Mary. It wounds me to the heart To hear thee speak thus. Jesus. And it wounds me, mother, Far deeplier than thy soul can understand To grieve theeâyes, in even the slightest point. But, when the choice is set before me thus, Mother or Father, things of earth or heaven, Thy mandate or God's voice within my soul, Which can I choose, which follow? Mary. It might be Joseph might help theeâor Ben-Aaron might. Hast ever stooped to ask advice of these? Thy father understands the scriptures well: So doth the Rabbiâhe's a learned man Who has spent his life in searching holy writ, In searching and expoundingâbut thine heart Is overmuch puffed-up with vanity. Jesus. Mother, enoughâwhen sunlight no more shines, When God no more lets fall upon the night For man to see star-jewels from his crown, When no more through the music of the waves Of blue Gennesareth he speaks to me, And through the snow-white lilies of the field, And through the grass-blades and the waving corn,â When I can see no God within the skies, And hear no God within my own heart's depths While watching lonely on the mountain-side, When that shall beâif ever that shall beâ Then I will listen to thy Rabbi's speech And follow in his steps. Mary. Wild utterance, son! Jesus. Nay, sober utterance, mother, for I speak With reason's keen-edged sword within my hand, The sword that cuts all ancient sophistries And severs custom's maxims. But henceforth Let us not speak upon these things. Go thou, Mother, thy way in peaceâlet me go mine; And when we meet before the throne of God A thousand centuries hence, when all is done, My gospel preached, the wide world won to me, My labours finishedâfor my task extends In scope beyond the extreme dim dusky point Of heaven to which the farthest star could sailâ When all is o'er, and we, as spirits then No more as mother and son, before God's throne Meet, thou shalt own that though thou sawest the skirts Of God's robe, I gazed straight within his eyes, Caught up the words fresh-falling from his lips, And felt the pressure of his hand in mine. But for to-day farewell. Mary. Farewell, my son. (Exeunt Jesus and Mary, at opposite sides of the stage). END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. The Tempter. Scene I. The Twelve at supper in a house at Capernaum. Jesus has not yet arrived. Eleven are seated. (Enter John). John. I have just left the Master. He bade me tell you not to wait for him; the sick folk he is visiting may take up all his time to-night. Matthew. They take up too much of his time. After all, healing the sick is not the only task of the Messiah. âThe Lord spake unto Ahaz, sayingââ John. Isaiah, as usual! For my part, I hold that Daniel is a far clearer and more reliable writer. What can be clearer than this? âAnd at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.â Judas. Pass the figs. James the Elder. Cannot you ask for them in decent Galilean? That Southern accent of yours is most unpleasant. Judas. You Northern folk are the most perfectly conceited beings I ever metâand the most ignorant. Not one of you has yet seen Jerusalemânot even the Master himselfâand yet you all talk as if the Temple was built upon the borders of your lake, and as if you were the builders of it! To choose Mount Gerizim for the rival edifice was evidently a mistake: the secessionists should have looked further North. Nathanael. Peace, peace. The Master bids us love one another, yet we are always quarrelling. Thomas. Naturally. There are so many of us. Twelve men are bound to quarrel. The only companions who never quarrel are a man and a woman. Jude. Ask Peter about that. He has a wifeâand a mother-in-lawâand they both live with him. Peter. A truce to this foolish nonsense. Do you know what happened last night? We left the Master at sunset, you will remember, going into the mountain alone, according to his habit. Then weâ Andrew, James and myselfâlaunched the boat and made for Capernaum, meaning to take the Master aboard at that rocky point where he generally meets us. But it came on to blow hard, and a big sea got up; there was more swell than I have seen for many a night. âWe can't take him on board,â I said; âwe shall split the old boat on the rocks.â But Andrew was all for holding on; so on we went, though the water was tumbling inâgreat white sheets of itâ over the gunwale. When we got near the coast we saw the Masterâquite calm and coolâstanding on the rocks, just as if it was a summer day and he waiting for us in the bright sunshine. âWe can never get him on board,â said I; but Andrew said, âHold on, never fear, he will find a wayââand what do you think happened? We were making straight for the rocks and I thought every moment we should founder, when suddenly the sail shook, the boat righted herself, and we passed into smooth water. It was shallow just there; Jesus walked through the shoal water and stepped aboardâand I can tell you I was thankful. When we started again, the wind had fallen; the Master had stilled the storm. We had to lower the sail and row all the rest of the way: there wasn't enough wind to shake a single thread of canvas. He is more than manânot a doubt of thatâI believe he could walk on the water if he chose. Andrew. He knows everything too. You remember the first time he spoke to us? When he told us to cast the net on the right side of the boat, and we made that wonderful haul. Matthew. Did you count the exact number of the fish? That is a very important point. Andrew. No: but there were some famous carp, with the richest steel-blue markings I ever saw, and nine or ten magnificent perch. Matthew (thoughtfully). Ten? Of course! âThe height of the one cherub was ten cubitsââalso there were ten golden candlesticks, ten brass tables, and ten brass lavers, in Solomon's Temple. Nathanael. I took a note of the total at the time, but I have unfortunately mislaid it. John (turning towards them). I remember the numberâI remember it distinctly. There were an hundred and fifty and three fishesâand that is very curious, for when I was a boy I was told by old Rabbi Jekuthiel that there are exactly that number of different species of fish. There is a meaning in this: when the Master told us that he would make us âfishers of men,â he meantâevidentlyâthat our preaching was to reach the whole world without exception; our net is to enclose converts of every possible kind. James the Less. A still more wonderful thing happened the other day. Have you not heard of it? The collector came round for the Temple tax; the Master told Peter to fling a line into the lakeâthe very first fish he caught (a roach it was) had in his mouth the exact coin required to pay the tax. Judas. The obliging roach! Pass the grapes. Thomas. I don't believe that story of the fish. It seems to me a childish fairy legend, too like those heathen tales we have all heard of. What I believe took place was this: Jesus sent Peter to fishâhe caught a fish, sold it, and paid the tax with the money he received. That is an instance of the way in which a story grows as it passes on from mouth to mouth; especially when there are women at hand to magnify and exaggerate it. Simon Zelotes. You are always for doubting everything, Thomas. Philip's sister told me she saw the fish, with the staterâa bright new oneâglittering in its mouth. Thomas. It was the hook that glittered in its mouthânot the stater. Philip. No: I believe my sister was right. For that matter, John the Baptist has himself performed very wonderful miracles; why should not our Master do the same? John (to Matthew). You devote too much time and thought to those endless genealogies of yours. The Master tells us to love God and man, to visit the sick, to help the poor, to deliver the oppressed, to comfort the friendless, but you pass your whole time in counting the generations between Abraham and Jesusâand, for all your counting, they never come out right. Matthew. There are certain difficulties, I confess. The prophet said, âBehold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son.â Thomas. Joseph would have a word to say to that, I should fancy. John. Then again: according to your idea the Master should have been born at Bethlehem, âthe city of Davidââbut he wasn't. On the contrary, he was born at Nazareth. Matthew. I admit that that is a pity, I admit it freely. In fact, it worries me a good deal. However, there are waysâ Peter. He saved me and my old boat, that is all I know. That is enough for me. Andrew. And for me too! John. And for me! Judas. Pass the wine. James the Elder (to Simon Zelotes). That man thinks of nothing but wine. Since the marriage at Cana he seems to suppose that the Master's store is unlimited. Simon Zelotes (to James). I hardly know why, but I distrust him greatly. (Enter Jesus suddenly). Jesus. Peace be with you! (All rising). Hail, Master! Scene II. A wooded valley near Nazareth. Ben-Aaron and Mary Magdalene engaged in conversation. Ben-Aaron. You love me not? It matters little, that, For you will learn to love me. Though our world Be dark and sad, there is this good thing in it, The fact that, once the crowning gift is won, Passion must surely follow. Mary. Your wise brain Deludes itself. I cannot love you. Ben-Aaron. Nay, I said not that; I said that you would learn After due time to love me. Mary, listen: The love of man, unlike the love of woman, Increases in its value with the years; A youth loves not the maidâhe loves to prove With amplest force to his conceited self His kingly strength by conquest after conquest; When once the woman's won, the youth must turn To other lips, if but again to prove By a new conquest that the first was sweet. Mary. Was that your manner, Sir, when you were young? Nay, doubtless you've forgotten. Pardon me. Ben-Aaron. I was about to say no woman knows What woman is to age; each year of life Makes woman far more precious unto man. The sun, the stars, the flowers, these things are fair, But fairer than all these the gift divine That woman's youth bestows on man's old age. The ancient legend erred; 'tis Eve who brings Creation unto manâthrough her he sees, Unchanged, again the golden light that shone Down the green dells and vales of Paradise. Moreover, as man older, wearier grows He learns not love for all things, but contempt For all thingsâproud contempt for those who preach Of heaven and God the while they know they lie, Contempt for rites that brainless fools ordain, Strong-browed contempt for all things saving one, The wild delight that woman's passion brings. Mary. But, Sir, your reverend life has been devoted To holiest ends, to labour and to works Whereof all tongues bear witness, while they praise. What can a girl do for you? Ben-Aaron. Much indeed, And in the sphere of labour. History speaks Through woman, he who loves her apprehends The pastâaye, every woman's touch reveals Some phase of history; one with amorous rays Of old Assyrian moonlight floods the room Wherein to-day her soft arms clasp her lover, Another's kiss within her lover's brain Renews the vision of strange sunlight poured Across ancestral deserts. Mary. Great indeed Must be the gifts of woman What could I Reveal, I wonder? Ben-Aaron (drawing nearer to her). Through her sovereign kiss Comes woman's revelation unto man. Mary (drawing back slightly). But if I love a youngerâ Ben-Aaron. Still there's place For me. Gaze deep within a young girl's eyes; You'll see two powers at once there manifestâ The power of loving youth, the power besides That (at the same time) seeks and sways the old. The youngest girl is older by an age Than her fair youthful lover, and her eyes Reveal it, for their amorous depths contain The very looks, even as her heart inherits The very modes, whereby in ancient days Old hearts were lured and won to wildest worship. Will you not kiss meâonce? Mary. I kiss you? No. And now pray let us part. There are bright girls In Galileeâaye, many and many a oneâ Who will be glad, for your gold's sake, to love you; But I care nought for gold. Ben-Aaron. If you will love me, I'll powder that superb black hair of yours With diamonds, as God powders all the night With stars. Some girls care not a jot for gold Whom diamonds madden. Mary. Diamonds, rubies, gold, Are good, but love is better. I love you not. Ben-Aaron. Come without loveâwhat matters love to me? Indeed I'd rather win you half reluctant; That adds the charm to love, the joyous zest, For when the woman half reluctant gives Kisses that one by one grow less reluctant Then man becomes a god. Mary. Choice godship, this! What would good Joseph who believes in you Think, if he heard you speak? Ben-Aaron. Joseph is nought, Aye less than nought, but you are everything. Life, youth, the sense of sweetness in the air Of summer, all the glory of the stars, The faith in some vast Power behind the stars, All these things, Mary, these and more than these, Thou canst restore, for I have come to know (Long years have taught me this) that age and grief And pain and death are conquerable alone By painless griefless deathless youth like thine. Thou canst on me the aging man bestow Not life eternal, something nobler far, Eternal rapture in a moment's space. Mary, I love thee. Mary. Never till the stars Drop out from heaven, and leave mankind aghast At their black eyeless sockets in the sky, Never till thenânay, never, even thenâ Shalt thou lay hand upon me. (Exit Mary). Ben-Aaron (gazing after her). Is it so? I cannot wrench the stars from out the sky To please youâI'll do betterâI will wrench Your heart from its red socket, then will hurl The quivering live thing bleeding at your feet. (Exit Ben-Aaron). Scene III. The banks of the River Jordan. Ben-Aaron and Jesus conversing. Ben-Aaron. I've sought thee hereâfor many a year I've known Thee and thy mother wellâher anxious heart Hath lately found its solace in outpouring Her griefs, her haunting sorrows, in mine ears. Thou art her grief, her sorrow,âthou hast mixed Thy name, thy work, with such a rabble crew! Thy mother heard that here on Jordan's banks Along with John the harebrained mad fanatic Her son was preaching to a motley crowd Of listeners,âoutcasts, malcontents, gay women, Beggars and fools and revolutionists! Meet for a mother's hearingâtales like these! I, on the spur of the moment, started off, For I have ever takenâas thou knowestâ Sincere pure interest in thy welfare, son. What news shall I return with? Shall I tell Mary that thou, acceding to advice, Wilt henceforth spend thy time in nobler deeds, Thinking high thoughts in fairer company? Jesus. There are two voices calling unto man Through life, and both are sweetâthe voice of friends, Of father, mother, home and family; This voice in many accents murmurs, âTread With us the trodden old familiar ways That lead along the valleys, where the flowers, Smiling, each summer morning greet the sun:â But yet another voice, most strangely sweet, Calls from the mountains, from the starlit dome Of night, from clouds and sunlit heights of air, Saying, âFollow to the end the lonely path That leads along the rugged mountain-side; Then shalt thou, when thy feet have climbed the heights, Behold God's glory and be one with him. A thousand prophets' souls have yearned to see, Yet never seen, the things thou shalt behold, For God, desired from all eternity By seer on seer, for thee is virgin still; Untouched for thee within the glittering walls Of his fair starlit palace, lo! God waitsââ Ben-Aaron. Death rather! Dreams like these have ever death, And bitterest death, for sequelâ Jesus. Death itself Is but the palace-gate. Beyond the gate Towers high the palace, and within God waits Superb for man's possessing; he who holds In his embrace the God of all the stars What needs he more of light of any star, Seeing that the Maker of all stars is his, His own, and his for ever? Ben-Aaron. Just one word; I grant thee this, that even a mortal may By one sure roadâone onlyâpast all heights That ever mortals dream of travel on Till face to face with the eternal God He stands forth wholly godlike, but the way Is not for thee to treadâthe way alone Is open unto him whose brain hath power To store all knowledge, knowledge of all times, All lands, all cities,âsecrets of the stars, Secrets of far-off history, dangerous lore Long buried, but for him resuscitate; Who, most of all, hath learnt from woman's heart Secrets God cannot teach, or, if he can, Jealous, holds back from mortals. Not for thee This high pursuit of knowledgeâit needs learning, Research and labour far beyond thy power. Yet thou mayest quit this desert, change thy ways: What message shall I bear to Nazareth? Thy mother hath sought thee sorrowing. Jesus. Tell my mother No more to seek me. Wherefore did she seek? Following my Father's voice, I left my home And sought the desert; God is with me here: I, seeming thus alone, am not alone, Never alone, because the Father is with me. Ben-Aaron. Foxes have holes, the birds of the air have nests, Thou only hast not where to lay thy head. Justice there is in thatâthou art unwise: Thou dost deserve no better of the Lord. Yes, gaze around. Is this stern rocky spot A fitting palace for the Son of Man? Leave unto John his locusts and wild honey, His frantic preaching, and his proselytes: If I mistake thee not, thy soul is dowered With nobler gifts for nobler ends than these. John's fate is certain; Antipas will soon Wake from his trance, and in some hideous prison John's mad career will find its fitting close. But thouâthou art not, with those blue soft eyes That all the women love, those auburn locks So all un-Jewish in their golden sheen, Thou, made by God thus fair to look upon, Art made for pleasure, not for blood-stained ends. Men call thee Son of Man: be Son of Man In all man's fulnessâdrain the cup of life; Thy Father puts that glad cup in thine hand! Jesus. Nay, life is thisâto do the Father's will; To save the race by loving to the end All saddest strays and outcasts of the race. I come to preach the deathless law of love,â The law whose nobler force shall abrogate The bitter code our teachers call the âLaw.â That âLawâ shall perish: ever clearlier shines The vision of my task before my gaze; What centuries have wrought I will undo, For one bold heart can utterly undo The heaped-up folly of ages. Ben Aaron. Vainest hope! The passionate dreamer is no match for man. Man is far strongerâfar more stupid too And therefore stronger, for in this our world Folly is strength; the gathered race of man Can overpower with its collective might And choke to silence with its brutal grip A single prophet, be he e'er so bold. Jesus. Not so! for even that prophet's blood-drops speak; The stones with which they stoned him win loud tongues And cry through all the future's ringing days, âThis prophet was of God; from God he came, But you, ye viper-brood, sprang forth from hell!â Ben-Aaron. And little shall that prophet gain thereby! Jesus. Blind that thou artâthou seest the green fair earth, The blue fair sky, the stars, the kingly sun, The mountains, fields,âthou thinkest these are all, And that no kingdom by man's eyes unseen Waits fair within the heavens. Ben-Aaron. Nay, give to me The starlit kingdom of a woman's heart; Give me the sunshine in a maiden's eyes; These are real things and priceless. Jesus. Love to thee Is just the moment's joy, but love means more To God and those who trust himâyea, it means A joy that deepens through eternity. Ben-Aaron. Thou art but young, thy thoughts are crude as yet: What hast thou seenâthou filled with heavenly dreamsâ What hast thou seen of earth? The holy city Thou, Son of Man, hast never gazed upon. When thou art weary of John's wild preaching here, Visit Jerusalem: thy mind will open; New thoughts will thrill thee, and thine heart will turn Ardent towards nobler issuesâthou art still Rustic in manners, rustic in thy speech; Thou art, as yet, uncultured, Galilean In all thy views, and 'mid uncultured folk Thy life has half been wasted. Jesus. Friend Ben-Aaron, The rough uncultured folk are those who see The face of God most clearly. Oftentimes Upon Gennesareth's waves my heart hath felt God's pure strange sweetness thrill it: fishermen Are nearer unto God than men in towns; In every sunset they behold God's splendour And in the clouds they trace the heavenly city. It does not need a scholarship profound To spell God's name correctly. Ben-Aaron. Then again, Another thingâthou art fair and full of life, Keen-witted, bright, pure-blooded, but as yet What know'st thou of the strange sweet world of women! âGod's sweetnessâ said'st thou? Sweet to eyes and taste The Lord may be, but sweeter lips than his Wait in Jerusalem, and hearts most eager, Doubtless, to hear the Galilean's teaching! I don't deny it, Galilean girls Are fairâindeed I've known some very fair And oneâbut let that passâthere are far fairer Within the city's walls; as yet, my friend, Thy knowledge is defective. Jesus. If I go Up to Jerusalemâand I may goâ It will be there to face the Pharisees, The Scribes, the Priests, the expounders of the Law; Aye, in the solemn Temple's very courts I'll speak the message of a God who reigns Among the mountains, on the wind-kissed shores, Whose kingdom's keyless gates are open wide, Whose precincts harlots enter. Ben-Aaron. If thou dost Thou'lt have against thee all the gathered force Of all good women, and thy work will end In most conspicuous failure. Woman hates Nought with such venomous hate as fallen woman! Jesus. And let the Temple's marble pillars rise August to heavenâtheir ornate shafts shall fall Prone on the pavement! Yea, I will destroy Their Temple made with hands, and in three days Raise up another. Ben-Aaron. Wise and modest words And worth remembering. (Aside) I will note them down; They may be useful. (Aloud) But enough of this: Visit Jerusalemâtake my adviceâ Life comes but once, but once to all of us, And life is worth the living; live it out, And live it grandly. Now, my friend, farewell. (Exit Ben-Aaron). Jesus. I'll to Jerusalemâas far as this He argues not inaptly. Well I know That in sequestered Galilee my sphere Of work is over-narrow. I must face There at Jerusalem the learned folk: âNo prophet comes from Galilee;â a prophet Shall come from Galilee before whose might Their strength shall be as weakness. Death may lurk Awaiting me within the city's walls; But deathâand, it may well be, death aloneâ Can nobly crown my mission. (Exit Jesus). Scene IV. Near Nazareth. Ben-Aaron and Mary Magdalene. Ben-Aaron. News from your sweetheart! for I've just returned From Jordan's rugged banks, where I beheld What seemed to me a monstrous piece of folly. Jesus submitted himself to be baptised Of Johnâthough why I know notâheaven and earth Never beheld two prophets more unlike. John has the desert's sternness in his bearing; Your Jesusâah! you smileâyou know his mienâ Seems to exhale the fragrance of the flowers Of his own native well-loved Galilee. âWell, I was saying, Jesus then stepped down Into the river's bed to be baptised. When he emerged, a mighty clamour rose: Some said they saw God's Spirit like a dove Descending on him, others said they heard A voice from heaven which cried with thunderous sound, âThis is my well-belovÃ¨dâhear ye him!â I saw no âdove,â I heard no âvoiceââI saw The sand, the rocks, the river, and I heard The clamorous voices of a crowd of fools. Mary. They are not worthy of him; that is true. Ben-Aaron. Worthy! Was ever yet the low base crowd For whom a prophet spent his life, or died, Worthy the prophet's glance? Mary. But will he stay There preaching in the desert? Ben-Aaron. Hardly that: I've urged himâand I think to purpose goodâ To quit the desert, and without delay To seek the holy city; there he'll find Fit hearers; there his genius will expand, His heart will win the sympathy of hearts Of nobler moulding than that desert crew. Besides, his life in Galilee is wasted. Mary. Wasted? Ben-Aaron. Yes, wasted. Listen, good my girl; Your heart despised Ben-Aaron, nor does he Complain with weak fool's plainingâwhy should he Complain? Revenge is ready to his hand. The old are not attractiveâmen or women; There is not much in me to lure a girl From tender talk to kisses, and from these Toâdon't look modest, would a modest girl Study the stars with Jesus of a night? There is not much in meâI say it outâ But there is much in Jesus, very much. Rely upon me, at Jerusalem Women will find that out; he'll never lack Kind feminine pure attendance. Were I you I'd to Jerusalem, and keep an eyeâ Mary. Think you, Ben-Aaron, that I cannot see The spiteful fierce revengeful devil in you? I loathe and scorn you. Ben-Aaron. Loathe and scorn me, dear, That matters very little, not at all Indeedâthe point that matters is just thisâ If you are jealous, now's the time for that. But then you are not jealousânever yet Was woman truly jealousâthey can trust Their charms to bind in chains their far-off lovers; And after all (bowing to her) Jerusalem may hold No woman like yourself. Mary. First lie, then flatter; Your baseness stands divulged. Ben-Aaron. Divulged, or not, Your danger stands divulged. Mary. I'm in no danger. 'Tis love breeds danger: I am not in love. Ben-Aaron. Ah! you're so young, your charms are wasted tooâ To that my speech was comingâwasted here In Galilee, poor soft unseen white bud; Why should you not in proud Jerusalem Burst into queenly blossom? Mary. Why, indeed! Because I love this quiet Galilee, And love not wild excitement. Am I fit, I, with my country ways, to mix with those Whose pride would scorn me? Ben-Aaron. There you quite mistakeâ 'Tis men feel awkward when they change their lot And mix with those above them. Never yet Did woman dowered like you with peerless beauty Rank lower than queen in any company. Beauty gives woman right to enter where The very gods assemble. Mary. Heathen gods Have no attraction for me. (Exit Mary). Ben-Aaron (rubbing his hands). All is well. When woman's tongue says âNo,â and when her eyes Say âYes,â the tongue's the liar. She will go. (Exit Ben-Aaron). Scene V. On the borders of the Lake of Gennesareth. Jesus pacing to and fro, soliloquising. Jesus. Yetâam I not in error after all Perchance? The ancient worship hath its charm, Its beauty: if I disregard the past, How many loving hearts I shall estrange! Am I mistaken? Are my thoughts my own, My own thoughts onlyânot, as I have deemed, God's thought imprinted deeply on my brain, That I in truth might carry out God's thought And make it known unto the sons of men? Shall I, instead of peace, send forth a sword On earth,âa sword most keen-edged to divide Mother from son, and faithful friend from friend? Yea, in the futureâfor my soul can see The future in prophetic moments spread Vivid before meâmen shall take my words, Twist them and wrest them to their own base ends, Shall torture prophets God-sent like myself, Hale them to deathâas me perchance they'll hale. The fires of future torment may leap high, All in the name of Jesus; for the heart Of man is cunning to pervert God's gifts And turn his choicest boons to bitterest curses. Others shall riseâgreat prophets, poet-souls, Reformers, thinkersâfor whom God prepares Doubtless vast tracts of deep abysmal darkness That their souls starlike may possess the dark And change it into light unutterable. As my soul shall shine starlike through the gloom Of centuries, so for other centuries these Shall shine like stars and slowly lead man on From faiths ignoble unto nobler creeds. Yet all of these the hands of man shall slay, The heart of man dishonour, in my name And as for my sakeâcalling me a God, Jehovah-Jesus, me whose throne was first A manger, next my workman's common bench, And whose last throne shall be an outcast's grave. O noble spirits whom in my name man's hands Shall basely use, whom in my name man's mind Shall baselier misinterpret, pardon me That I unknowing, powerless, sealed your doom! Stars wear ye, doubtless, lordlier in your crowns Than the pale stars that gem my diadem! But from JudÃ¦a with full heart to-day I hail and greet ye: virgin are the lips Of God, though I have kissed them, for your lips, O prophets of the far-off years, to touch! The fulness of the Godhead unimpaired, Untampered with, awaits you: never man Plunged deep in the abysses of God's heart But starrier heights, profounder depths, beyond Shone, and shine on for ever. Doubt has passed: The Father's will shall to the end be done. (Exit Jesus). (Enter Ben-Aaron, on the opposite side of the stage). Ben-Aaron. There's Peter?âvehement, eager, over-boldâ Of little use to meâand Andrew too; Better the twain at casting of a net For fish than carrying out a great man's purpose: Matthew? Messiah-ridden, dreamy, weakâ His one desire's to prove the prophecies Fulfilled to the minutest point in Jesus: Simon Zelotes? Not of much account; A mere fanatic, trained too in the school Of fierce-tongued Judas the mad Gaulonite: Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee; James might be got atânot so easy though; The younger, John, with that girl-face of his, As beautiful as Jesus, though the strength That crowns the grace in Jesus is not there, His case is hopelessâsee him lean his head On Jesus' breastâyou'd think the man no man, But womanâhardly of the purer sort: Next Jude and James, the cousins of our friend; Something in them of Mary Cleophas Their mother, somewhat fool-fanatical, Unfits them for my purpose; they have clung To Jesus closelier than his brothers have; Some think they are his brothersâfools all round: What of Bartholomew? he, with learned look, Takes notes of Jesus' sayingsâhe might be Of use, could I but gain himâhe might make An excellent strong witness at the close: Then Philip of Bethsaidaâfar too fond Of watching dead folks rise, uncanny task! Thomas? A better man; I like to hear His soft tongue puzzle Jesus with his questionsâ âLord, what's the date of this? the hour of that? The name of him or her? where did she dwell? When did her illness leave her? was her face Unspotted still with fever?ââand so forth; He's just the only one of all the set Possessed of anything approaching culture. Stayâthere's another, and with far more âbackâ As our rough peasants sayâIscariot: He's from the Southâthe only stranger here; The others hate him, and he hates the others; They jeer, they taunt him with his Southern speech, He taunts them (rightly!) for their Northern crassness. Yes, he's my man: there's something in his eyes I likeâa certain sudden flash at times; He'll do great deeds, if only I can make Great deeds well worth his whileâhe holds the bag; He can be coarse at moments in his speechâ Though coarseness shocks me, coarse men none the less Are useful toolsâone ought not to complain When handling useful weapons at their roughness; The rougher handle gives the closer grip. Besides if what I hearâone hears so much, So little of it's true, but this is true I thinkâif only what I hear is true, The man's in love with Mary, and in him Love meansâwell, several thingsâbut most of all Mad boundless fierce unreasoning jealousy; And jealousy is just the fittest string For me to harp uponâof all great deeds Man ever did, I think the greatest deeds Were done through jealousy,âthat little word Bodied in acts has changed all history's course And ground high towers to dust. Here comes the man: I'll test him straightway. (Enter Judas.) Prithee, tell me, Sir (You know me, doubtless, though we have not met Of late)âwhat think you, Judas, in your heart Of Jesus and his followers? Tell me truly. Judas. With doubting Thomas I've some sympathy: As for the others, they're a crack-brained crew; They gape and wonderâgape again and worshipâ Their gape's so large that it can swallow down Without an effort even the most immense Unprecedented strange miraculous tale; Water to wine, or olives into figs, Palm-leaves to golden crownsâall's one to them! In fact I pity Jesusâfor he's forced To follow along the road these madcaps take, Though for his own partâyes, I'll do him justiceâ The man whose faith in his own miracles Is least and feeblest, isâthe man himself. If he put forward not one single deed Of wonder, claimed no preternatural power, His ardent followersâbe you sure of thatâ Would still enswathe in thaumaturgic fog Their Master, choking in the dense damp mist Of their obscene creation; yes indeed, They would performâthough with less dexterous handâ Unending miracles, if he would notâ Flood Galilee with marvel, and proclaim Their great Messiah-conjuror come at last! Ben-Aaron (aside). What could be better?âsound and vigorous thoughtâ Clear-headed fearless insight. (Aloud) Listen, Judas; I wish to know if at some future date I can rely upon you? It may be That I shall need your service. Judas. In good sooth You may rely upon meâI can guess Your motive tooâin fact, it hardly needs Much probing. Ben-Aaron. I admit it, I was sweet Upon the girl myselfâas you are sweet To-day upon her. I'll confess as well She quite disdained me. Judas. Did you think that strange? Ben-Aaron. Uncivil, Sirâbut I can bear with you, And I can bear with herâbut not with one Who has robbed me of her. Judas. No: revenge is sweet. Ben-Aaron. Most sweet! and I will have it. 'Tis to you I look to aid me. Judas. I will aid you Master. Ben-Aaron. I thought as much; and, when two plot revenge, Revenge is half accomplished. 'Twas for that I sounded you, to know your inmost thoughts As to this man's disciples. As to him What think you? He can dupe the world, it seems, But can he dupe himself? Judas. I cannot doubt it. Ben-Aaron. Does he love Mary? Judas. That I hardly know. With his strange far-fetched dreams of heavenly love What you and I call love is quite remote From his strained upward vision. Ben-Aaron. Does she love him? Judas. I'll answer that to better purpose soon. I think she loves himâbut I think she knows Not yet how much she loves him. Ben-Aaron. Do you think She loves him yet enough to stand the siege Of the young Roman gallants? Judas. Roman gallants? Ben-Aaron. I've been persuading her to take a step Judas. What step? Ben-Aaron. To launch herself with all her beauty Full on Jerusalem; I think that there She may forget this Jesus, andâperhapsâ For you and me her heart may grow more tender. Judas. It may be so; she knows not her own mind As yet. Ben-Aaron. But she will quickly learn to know Her own mindâtrust meâat Jerusalem. Thither all prophets go, and thither go Fair women loved by prophets; Jesus soon, I doubt it not, will seek the holy city: She'll seek it tooâand you and I will seek it. The rest will followâthe eleven apostles (I don't degrade you, friend, by counting you, Clear-headed you, among the unsapient number!) And all the applauding crowd, both male and female: He'll drag half Galilee along with him. Wellâwell and goodâwithin the holy city The play we've started shall with grand success Achieve itself, for am I not Ben-Aaron? Jesus has written the first act of the drama Andâhere in Galileeâwith touch idyllic Depicted therein many a bright glad scene. Mary's the heroine: lake and sky and hills Form fitting scenery, fair Nature's background; The eleven apostles are superb scene-shifters; You, Judas, are the villain of the piece, While I'mâa Satan, posing for the nonce As ever-resourceful acting manager. You take your cueâyou see? But now the acts That follow shall in quite a different sphere Be played, and with fresh actors: Rome shall send A company to join the Galileans, And at Jerusalem the holy city With priests to act and Pharisees and Scribes The drama shall be brought to a fitting close. I'll write the finish, even I Ben-Aaron, And write it not with finicking soft touch Like Jesusâhe was well content to write In inkâI'll write in blood. Judas. You really are Superb at times; I love to listen to you! Ben-Aaron. Listen, and act with meâyou'll surely see I shall succeed. I never yet have failed, When matched 'gainst man or woman. Judas. I believe you! You are the devilâso you must succeed. Ben-Aaron. There is no devilâthat is superstition. The devil is dead, and when the devil died I bought his commonplace-books. Judas. Money spent Right well. Ben-Aaron. Let's lose no time. Judas. I'm at your service. (Exeunt Ben-Aaron and Judas). END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Mary. Between seven and eight years have elapsed. Scene I. Apartment, richly furnished, in Mary Magdalene's house at Jerusalem. A sumptuous supper is spread. Tibullus, Valerius, Licinius, Hortensius, Pompilius, Caius, and other officers, all reclining on couches in the Roman fashion. Mary presiding. Caius reclines on the couch next to Mary. Valerius. Tibullus is going to singâa song of his own composing, I make no doubt. Hortensius. And we can all guess the subject Tibullus is very hard hit. Licinius. Yes: when a woman like Mary twangs the bow-string, love's arrows fly straight to the mark. Pompilius. How that old reprobate Caius chatters! âNo fool like an old fool;â I believe he honestly thinks that Mary is in love with him! Licinius. In fact, she does not appear to dislike his proximity. They have been whispering together in that way the whole of supper-time. Pompilius. Yes: but though her tongue is with him, her eyes are elsewhere. It is by a woman's eyes that you must judge; when a woman is in love with a man, she can help speaking to himâoften, in fact, avoids doing soâbut she cannot help looking at him. Her eyes seek him, in spite of herself, and her eyes are now seekingâ Valerius. Hush, Pompilius! Tibullus is just going to begin. (Tibullus sings). Some love endures a season; It blossoms as the rose: It blooms without a reason, Without a thought it goes. It comes through dreamland's portal; It flashes on our eyes; It makes some song immortal, Then in an hour it dies. Such love, though brief and hollow, Wins worship as of old: A thousand lovers follow The form they may not hold. âThe fairest love is fleetest And soonest lost in gloom; Love's dawn,â they say, âis sweetest When sunset brings its doom.â If pleasure's white hand beckons, What eager hearts pursue! The pain, the cost, who reckons? Who asks if love be true? That love is sweet is certain, The noontide sun is brightâ Why lift the future's curtain? Why peer into the night? (He pauses). Valerius. Don't stop, Tibullus. There is more, surely? Mary. Let me hear the restâthere is sweetness in your song. Tibullus. Your wish is a command. (He continues). Yet with immortal passion, Though not in all men's ears, A love of nobler fashion Singsâas to one that hears. To live,âif life be needed; To die,âif she may gain; For this my heart hath pleaded: Will passion's prayer be vain? (Officers applaud loudly, with the exception of Hortensius). Mary. It is a lovely song. A thousand thanks to you. Pompilius (to those sitting near him). How strange a thing it isâyou may meet a hundred fair women, yet only one can wield the sovereign spell which brings the whole world to her feet. I have seen many women with marvellous black hair, yet I believe no woman, living or dead, ever had hair like Mary's There is some subtle distinction in the colour; in the way it falls over the brow; and, probably, in its fragrance. Valerius. I think her lovelier than ever. Her beauty has a strange charm: it fascinates the more, the more it is studied. Hortensius. Yes: it is essentially studied beauty, and that is why I dislike it. Every pose is studiedâ I'll wager she studies that graceful swan-like curve of the neck for an hour every day before the mirror. Valerius. You are incorrigible, Hortensius. And yet at Rome the other day who was it that allured you?âa beauty with pencilled eyes, and cheeks as radiant as the seductive rouge could make them! Hortensius. One thing I will sayâour fair hostess does not paint. Tibullus. Paint! What need has she, with a complexion which Venus might copy, and which the rose might envy? I love her beyond expression; I should like to die for her. Hortensius. Never die for a woman. Die for a friend, die for Rome, but not for a woman. One is always sorry afterwards. Tibullus. I would die for her. I believe her to be as pure as sunlight. These tales that are told about her are lies spread abroad by disappointed suitors, nothing more. Was there ever loveliness like hers without detractors? Pompilius. Does this present scene suggest an impeccable woman, does it savour of purity? Tibullus. Mere eccentricityânothing more. She trusts herself and she trusts us. Pompilius (aside to Hortensius). If it were known that this rash fellow had left his post at the guard-house to-night for the sake of honouring the fair Mary's banquet with his presence, it might go hard with him; his courage would then have to be put to the test! Hortensius (to Pompilius). He would die if necessary, never fear; and that, I warrant you, right willingly. Love is an intoxicatingly sweet form of madness: it swims rivers, climbs mountains, and, did the loved one so order, would, I doubt not, find some way of clambering from star to star and landing safe and sound upon the moon! Licinius. What do you make of her age, Pompilius? Softlyâdon't let her hear us. Pompilius. Her age? She is a woman, her lips ring with woman's richest laughterâand yet she has about her, like some strange magic robe, all the ineffable glory of maidenhood. Licinius. And then that supple figure of hersâ did you ever see such peerless grace of outline? Tibullus. Her voice is music. If Helen's voice in the least degree resembled hers, who can any longer wonder at the passion of Paris or the flames of Troy? Valerius. Her eyes are the most wonderful thing of allâhave you ever remarked them? Sometimes they are full of laughter; sometimes they are full of passion; sometimes I have seen them full of tears. All lovely moods of woman seem to lighten through them, and, when I watch them, I understand without an effort all stormy or starlit passions of history. Hortensius. By Venus, for all her âineffable glory of maidenhoodâ she looks as if she could bite poor old Caius! Valerius. He has not pleased her by his conversation. You can see that. Licinius. No: he does not understand women. He has had the folly to praise another woman before Mary's face. Mary. Gentlemen, gentlemen. A little of your attention in this direction, if you please. You will have time enough to discuss your sweethearts, when you leave me presently. Tibullus. We were not discussing sweethearts. In the presence of the sun, stars wane and pale into insignificance. Mary. And I am the sun! Does it need to study at Rome to learn to pay so graceful a complimentâ the hot glaring flaring sun indeed! I would rather be the moon. The sun shines on husbands, but the moon gives light to lovers. Valerius. No: the world basks in the sun's rays, as we in the rays of your superb beauty. Mary. I once loved a man. You may not believe it, but I did. And he was the only man who never paid me a compliment. I think that was why I loved him. Licinius. He must have been a heartless villain. Mary. On the contrary, he was all heartâsomewhat too much so.âBut come, I have a surprise for youâa new dish and a sweet oneâthe sweetest in the world. Observeâmy servants are now bringing it. I know you Romans like novelties. (Enter SERVANTS, bearing a huge dish, with a golden cover richly wrought and inlaid). Now, gentlemen, who shall lift the cover? Which is the cunningest epicure among you? Licinius. Pompilius! Valerius. Hortensius! Hortensius. Licinius! Pompilius. Valerius! Mary. You don't seem to agree. Caius, you lift the cover. You are the oldest, and therefore the least likely to be greedy. (The younger officers titter. Caius, frowning, lifts the cover, and a young girl is seen, naked, kneeling in the dish). There, gentlemen! Did I not say that I had a surprise for youâthe sweetest dish in all the world? Though Rome send warriorsâand cooksâEast and West and North and South, they will never bring to Rome a nobler gift for a royal banquet. This is the dish to taste whose sweetness conquerors have paused from conquest, poets from divinest labour,âyea, the very gods from world-building, Apollo from his impassioned lyre, and Jove from his surly sessions 'mid the stars. This time it is prepared from my own private recipe. It may not in our presence be tasted, but . . . Caius, have you stared long enough? Hortensius, look this way. Pompilius, I am rapidly growing jealous. Valerius, have you never seen such a thing before? Tibullus, did you not know that such fruit grew in Jerusalem? (To the SERVANTS). Take away the dishâ only the dishâand bring Bashemath her dancing-robes. (Exit SERVANT. He presently re-enters with dancing-robes, which he assists Bashemath to put on). (To the Girl). Step down, Bashemath, you must be tired of kneeling there. Don't be afraid. These gentlemen are noble and well bred Romansâthey will not eat youâthough Caius looks somewhat that way inclined!âNow, when you are ready, you shall dance before my friendsâand for nothing. We are not mercenary; we don't require a John the Baptist's head for payment! (The GIRL descends. Exeunt SERVANTS, with the dish and cover. The GIRL dances. Officers converse aside). Hortensius. A good joke. Valerius. Nay! 'tis going somewhat too far, I think. Pompilius. Nonsense. The girl is as proud as Venus pacing before Jupiter, or flaunting her milk-white charms before Paris. Licinius. Yes: butâin factâher beauty in this public place seems sadly wasted. Pompilius. Ohâyou are never satisfied till beauty's arms embrace you and beauty's lips close upon your own! Licinius. Never. (The dance ends. Exit DANCER). Mary. Now, gentlemen, I hope your hostess has not misinterpreted your cultivated tastes, nor altogether displeased you. It grows late: I must retire and leave you to yourselves for awhile. You will also, I fear, be deprived of your chief wit and most brilliant talker, for I see that Caius has slipped away in pursuit of my dancing-girl. (She rises and withdraws). Officers (in chorus). Good luck to Caius! Scene II. The same night. Street outside Mary's house. (Enter Tibullus, followed almost immediately by Judas). Judas. A word with you. You are of the guests who leave The house of Mary? Tibullus. What is that to you? Judas. Of little importâbut to you it means Much, very much. You love her? Tibullus. Go your way; Insult her not, insult me not, or else, Jew though thou art, it may be worse for thee: Ere this I would have stricken thee from my path, Were not her nation thine. Judas. (drawing Tibullus aside). Tibullus, listen. I know thee, and I know thy love for her, But Mary also I know. A thousand love her: Romans and Jews alike lay down their arms And pass beneath the yoke of Mary's beauty. But of her thousand lovers thou alone Dost love her purely, therefore love I thee And now would speak with thee. Tibullus. Speak on: but harm not Her reputation by a half breathed word, Else surely will I slay thee! Judas. Reputation? Oh, reputation is a doubtful word; It means so muchâso littleâreputation! Why, one man's reputation turns upon The number of girls he's ruinedâfame for him Speaks from a hundred virgin lips dishonoured. Again, some women count it sport to find Unsullied maids for man; their reputation Turns wholly upon success or non-success In drawing towards old men's desirous lips Young girls' lips non-desirousâ'prythee which, Which reputation's Mary's? Tibullus. Devil of hell, Speak out, or else I slay thee! Judas (bowing obsequiously). Nay, thy servant Proceeds thus slowly, is of doubtful speech And halteth, lest he wound thee. May he speak? Tibullus. Speak, and let hell receive thee. Judas. Wouldst thou know The very whole, or wouldst thou know a part, Part only, of the whole? The whole, they sayâ (Tibullus strides forward, and makes as though he would seize Judas). Nay, touch me not, else wouldst thou never hear The whole! Tibullus. Once moreâand 'tis the last timeâspeak. Judas. Remember then, most noble gallant sir, Thyself didst bid me speak. Touch not thy sword: Believe me, another needs that princely blade; Could but that princely keen blade know the whole, 'Twould yearn to drink his heart's blood. But I dally: Listenâthou trustest Maryâshe betrays Thy trust, is mistress to a hundred men, Sells for sweet gold (gold is so very sweet!) The lips thou hardly darest to dream upon; Aye, even now within the very room Thou leftest shortly since she, laughing softly, With amorous kisses prostitutes herself, Embracing thy sworn friend. Tibullus. His nameâhis name? This sword shall drink before the morning's light Its fill of blood: if thou art speaking truth, The blood of this foul traitorâif thou liest, Then thine. His name? Judas. Valerius. Tibullus. Go thy way. I'll to the house of Mary. (Exit Tibullus). Judas (laughing and looking after him). Go thy way, But hasten not so fast, thou valiant Roman! Nay, spare thy breathâthou art so fleet of footâ Leave them alone a little; it may be The first embrace thus early in the night Is scarce accomplished, and their lips close-joined Will hardly part to greet youâTarry therefore, Unless you wishâas ardent Phinehas Stabbed woman and man, our ancient record saithâ To stab them in mid-tide of wild enjoyment! Nay, wait awhile, and when they pause for breath Start forth, with those great flashing eyes of yours And that drawn threatening swordâBe interlude Then to their kisses, they'll be weary then And glad to greet you; she perhaps (who knows?) âWomen are kindâmay keep a place reserved For you upon the smooth side of her couch And give you noble opportunity. âWell, two are thus disposed of. Will these Romans Alive and valiant see to-morrow's sun? I trow not. Thus proceeds with steps that leave Flame in their track my scheme of vengeance. Vengeance gives zest to love, and love inflames The fuel of vengeance to yet fiercer glow, Till all the sky burns red. (Exit Judas). Scene III. âSame night. Private apartment in Mary's house. Mary amd Valerius engaged in conversation. Balcony outside, partly hidden by curtains. The window is open, the sky is visible, and the stars are shining. Valerius. And so he loves you! 'Tis a generous youth: Why not requite his passion? Cynics say Women love vice in man, not virtuous deedsâ But is that true? Mary. A man of spotless worth Is oft-times dull to deal with. Women love True love in man; they love excitement better, Excitement, movement, change. Moreover, too, What women crave forâyes, beyond all elseâ Is strength; they being the weaker must look up, Not downâmust lean, and not be leaned upon. Tibullus worships me. I worshipâstrength. Valerius. Strength goes with baseness often. Mary. And with virtue Weakness that ruins all. Your virtuous man Trembles before a woman, cries âI love you, But I love virtue better! Passion's fair, But honour's fairerâwe'll not sully honour. If here on earth I win you not, in heaven As angels we shall meet.â Valerius, Do you believe in angels? Valerius. I believe? The dead are dead, I take it. I have seen Wild battles where the countless slain lay heaped, Filling the fields with horror. I have watched Their strange stiff attitudes, their limbs outstretched, Their faces pale but blood-streaked, and their eyes Wide open, glaring at the sunlit heavens Whence never pitying sun-god stooped to save: And, as I watched, I have thought âIs this the seed Whence spirits and angels spring? Impossible.â (Tibullus appears on the balcony, unseen by Mary and Valerius, and watches). Mary. I love the sunlight; I love not the dead. Valerius. Thou art as very sunlight, what hath death To do with thee? The gods, creating woman, Made one thing deathlessâbeauty such as thine. Mary. The worms will banquet on it. Valerius. Speak not thus. Nay, let us speak of love, for love transcends All mortal limits, and our legends say That gods for love's sweet sake have stooped to earth, Forgetful of Olympus. Dost thou love me? Mary. Loveâwhat is love? One moment's fierce-drawn breath, One spasm of joy, the blossom of a flower, One flash of sunlight on the dark world's way, One flash, and then the tomb. Yes, that is love. Valerius. Nay, are not earth's sweet brief things sweeter far In virtue of their briefness? Aye, the gods May envy man, meseems, for not to Jove Who through the vistas of eternity Pursues for ever love's evasive form Fell ever brief strange rapture such as ours When all past history's nights of passionate love In our night mingled, and that night became To mortal hearts immortal. Dost thou love me? Mary. Valeriusâif I said, âI love Valeriusââ (Enter Tibullus suddenly, from the balcony). (to Tibullus). No, Bashemath's not here. Tibullus. Thou sweet-tongued liar, Thou knowest I seek not Bashemath, but thee, And thee I findâ Mary. Discussing various points Of dainty cookery, with our friend Valerius. Pray, is there harm in that? The feast to-night Was in some points amiss; Valerius brings A hundred delicate choice recipes from Rome, And he and I discuss them. Tibullus. In the nightâ Aloneâdoors fastenedâwith your couch anigh, Whereon to spread the banquet? Lie no more; Though lying brings such radiance to your eyes, Such colour to your cheeks, that half I say, âLie: and lie on for ever!â Truly guilt Takes on so fair and pure a form in you That spotless innocence might feel ashamed, Blush for its lack of grace, and doubt itself, Beholding sin rewarded by the gods With more than mortal beauty. Mary. Still, Tibullus, Your periods pause upon the brink of verse. Why hesitate to take the daring plunge? You'd make a noble poet! Tibullus. Still the sameâ Save that the lovely laughter in your eyes Which Iâthe gods forgive meâonce believed Meant perfect purity, now meansâ Valerius. Tibullus, Take friendly counsel, leave us. Tibullus. Leave you here! You call that friendly counselâdevil's counsel. I once believed in friendship, and in love; I now believe in hateâand hate shall spur My willing soul to vengeance. Come with me. Leave thisâyour concubineâand come with me. Valerius. Take back those words. Tibullus. Nay, I add further words. I say that here you linger like a coward, That this sweet whore whose honied lips have drugged To sleep the manhood in you may defend you! Cower behind herâuse her form as shield: I would not pierce her body with my sword, For though I hate, I love her. You I hate; For you, being part of her by this night's deed, Are separate yet, and as a separate form Fit target for revenge. Come forth, I say! Valerius. Nay, rave not thus; though true it is indeed Her beauty hath maddened wiser heads than yours. She is not what you thought her: she is better, Far better than you thought her, being a woman. You dowered her with white wings, forgot her lips, And womanhood resides in woman's lips, Not in her wings; when man forgets her lips, Woman forgets to love him. Learn the truth: The gods make woman, not as poets make, But as they love to find her. Tibullus. Gods of hell, Not gods of heaven! Nay, must I strike you then? Strikeâbefore herâthat false mouth she has kissedâ (makes as though he would strike Valerius). Valerius. Enough. Mary. Nay, pause! Tibullus. The die is cast. Farewell. (Exeunt Valerius and Tibullus). Mary. Triumph! and yet I tremble; why, I know not. Two valiant soldiers these; I love them both, Or rather love not either. Men complain They understand not woman, know not whom She loves of all her loversâyet, in sooth, Woman knows less than they do! When the sun Is high and all the world in passionate light Basks, woman loves an emperor; but at eve, When the stars' magic flashes through her eyes And somewhat in her soul of madness lurks, She longs, it may be, to abase herself, And loves that emperor's slave. A woman's heart, Had all the stars of heaven the eyes of men, The hearts of men, would, finding room for all, Crave yet for stars to light new depths of gloom In that strange heart's abysses. Yet is there in me somewhat left of pity! Faith have I none, nor hope; yet men are fairâ Tibullus wears the morning on his brow, While in the eyes of dark Valerius Couches revengeful midnight: I will forth And stay this duelâit is not all unsweet To woman that brave men should die for woman, And men have died for me; but these shall not. I'll forth and find themâswords have hardly crossed As yetâwhen judgment on my soul descends, And when the righteous strong Lord of my race Says, âLo! the flames await thee,â I will say, âLord, though I sold my beautyâthough I squandered The gifts thou gavest meâI did one deed Not all unrighteous, for I saved two men Noble from fate ignoble. (Exit Mary). Scene IV. Same night. Street not far from Mary's house. (Enter Valerius and Tibullus). Tibullus. The world grows darkâa poisonous blackness pours Its murky streams across the shuddering air, Extinguishing the pale stars one by one And leaving nought but midnight. Oh, Valerius, Before I slay thee I would speak with thee, Resume old days, yea call thee once more friend! When, shouting barbarous shouts, the Gallic host Charged in that wild affray and when their leader Held me dismounted, swordless, at his mercy, Rememberest thou how that strong sword of thine Flashed in the air? our glittering foeman fell Headlong, and all his life-blood stained the corn Deep-red; but now our swords must cross. Valerius, My brain is dazed, my thoughts like reinless steeds Gallop at fiery random where they will, Tossing their manes and foaming . . . After all Is love worth friendship? Is it worth our while To quarrel over such a jade as this? Women were surely fashioned by the gods First to fan high the flame of lust in man, Then with sweet hands to quench it! Even the gods, Our poets tell us, are so stung by lust That they must take on mortal forms whereby To accomplish passion: even the king of gods, Jove, must win DanaÃ« in a shower of gold, Pursue Europa as a milk-white bull, Court Leda in a wild swan's graceful form, And so for ever. Can it matter now? Can aught of evil wrought beneath the sun Move me? Aye, even in Hades where the crowds Of pale and shadowy ghosts flock to and fro Between me and the phantoms one fair face Would ever rise, one voice would cry âValerius!â (As even just now I heard)ââI love Valerius!â And all my heart would hunger at the cry, Hunger and thirst for blood; for nought can save A soul who having loved is thus betrayed Save only vengeance, vengeance sweet and full:â Yea, were the sire of gods, the mighty Jove, Proud passionate Mary's kingly paramour, My soul would, seeking, mount up to the stars, And, having found them sinning, 'mid the stars My human sword should flash and stain the stars With God's blood crimsonâdraw thy sword, Valerius,â At once . . . quick, draw thy sword. Valerius. What must be, must. Have at thee, then! The Fates no man can bribe. They weave our destinies at varying looms, But one gift bear they earthward neverâpity. I loved theeâand I love herâhear thou this. Now, if slay thee, 'tis not that I hate thee, But that I love her so that all the world Fades from my gaze when she with queenly tread Passes its vestibules, as Juno might, Pausing awhile from dalliance with the gods To yield one kiss to mortals. Mary's lipsâ Yes, I have kissed her . . . Tibullus. Nay! enough, enoughâ Must sudden onslaught slay thee? Valerius. Till one falls! (They fight. Valerius falls). Tibullus (stooping over the body). Dead! dead! and I have slain him. Oh! my friend, My friend. My brain grows clearer now. 'Twas clogged with blood. My sword that pierced to brave Valerius' heart Has lanced my brain as well, and now the blood That clogged it leaves it clear. I understand. The world's a fraudâone ghastly subterfuge Whereby the gods that ruleâmisruleâOlympus Would cheat and cozen mortals. Nought is right, Save only wrong; friendship's a hollow name And love is mockery; passion's nought but lust; The man who worships womanâas I worshippedâ Commits a crime against the most high gods, In that the contrast of his pure performance Cries shame upon their deeds,âand so the gods, Furious, hurl vengeance on him. Ah! the gods Approve the base, honour the foul seducer: Not to the brave, the pure, the strong, the noble, Oh not to these a woman's love is given! The lover who would die for her, wins nought, But he who damns her soul and laughs, wins all. (Enter Roman Officer, with company of SOLDIERS). Arrest me: I am ready. (Pointing to the corpse). See, there lies Valerius,âI have slain him. Officer. We arrest you. (Exeunt Officer and SOLDIERS, leading Tibullus under arrest and bearing away gently the body of Valerius). Scene V. âAnother Street. (Enter Mary in haste and looking around her. A faint light of dawn glimmers in the East). Mary. Not here! Then this is not the road they took, And my good deed falls fruitless. Long ere now Their swords have clashed. . . but after all, what matters? The deeds of years not by one single deed Are cancelled, though that deed stood out superb And took the world with sunlightânay, the world Is woven of love and horror, these are mixed Like colours in a web, and God, no doubt, Could nowise else design a fitting pattern. God. . . once I hoped in Godâin early days Dreamed that the blue lake glittered at his touch And that the light of morning on the hills Was light that fell from heaven; but nowâah! now The light of morning is an alien thing,â The light of lamps in festal chambers stirs Pulses that throb not at the morning's flame: Yet, while the gay lamps shine, within my soul Spreads wide the eternal darkness. (Enter Jesus, unperceived by Mary). Once a man Spake words of hopeâsweet words from human lips Seemed to reveal the God behind the veil, And all my heart in answer to those words Sprang heavenward, even as flowers whose petals turn Wide open towards the sunlight. God seemed near: The lonely mountains, when those words were spoken, Gleamed as with angels' wings, and all the earth Was as God's footstool; now this sinful city Stands between me and God, and all my deeds Raise clamorous voices, crying âIn such a place You ruined oneâanotherâhere anotherâ Depart, for hell awaits you.â I had dreamed I might be lovedâbut onceâwith noble love, Love born of heaven and light: I have been loved, Not onceâa hundred timesâyet every time Have learned to scorn the lover, seeing his love Was born of starless darkness. Now to-nightâ The East's afire with dawn,âno dawn for me Upon the earth accursed, accursed in heaven, Worshipped by man (what is that but a curse?) Yet ever hearing in my heart the cry âThou, worshipped one, art just the lowest of things! Men kiss thy lips, and then behind thy back Their wanton foul tongues make a jest of thee: Thou art the lowest of thingsâa fallen woman.â For all else there is hope; for snakes and worms, For thieves and murderers, for vilest things, Men who seduce, the base hearts that betrayâ Aye, for the lowest of men there still is hope, But is there hope for woman? Jesus (advancing towards Mary). There is hope. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV. Judas. (Two months have elapsed). Scene I. âRoom in Mary's house. Mary and Jesus conversing. Mary. My heart grows lighter. When, two months ago, We met, all hope had vanished, but thy face Brought back sweet hope and dreams of days gone by. Jerusalem was changed; with thee within it The sinful city fair and holier grew, For through the eyes of man a God can shine Filling the rocky wilderness of life With everlasting sunlightâthou art God, For God is love and goodness, and thou art The spirit of love and goodness. Jesus. I and God Are one, for through my voice the Father speaks, Sending good news to mortals. Man and God, At war through all the ages, now at last May meet in holiest peace; what prophets spake In me the Son of Man shall be fulfilled, Though not as men would have it. They would crown My brows with earthly fame,âbut not for fame Left I the eternal heavens; I came to seek The poor, the lost, the sad, the wandering sheep, The dark of soul, the guiltyâbidding all Believe that in the Father's watchful heart Dwells love for each and all, and boundless pity. Thee have I saved; and women in time to come Saved by the sons of men shall bear thy name, The name of Magdalene, and so shalt thou Redeem the coming ages: all the world May be redeemed through love, and I through love Will surely save it. Mary. But the world is dark, Full of all evil, horror, murderous crime. Man's world is crimson with the blood of man, And woman is man's slaveâas I have beenâ Man's slave, and yet man's tempter. Jesus. Have thou faith In me and in the Father. Unto God A thousand years are but a moment's space: The God who made the worlds can save the worlds: God made the sinner,âbut he also made The heart that loves the sinner, even mine. My heart is as God's heart, and God's is mine: Yea, through our hearts, the Father's and my own, Flows love that shall redeem the very vilest And lift the lowest to a throne on high, Pure in the starlit heavens. Believest thou? Mary. Lord, I believe that thou art sent to save The world. Jesus. The world will in the end be saved, And by my death,âbut ages yet will pass, Ages of strife and anguish, ere the end. I came not to bring peace: I came to send Upon the earth a sword, and to reveal The secrets of all hearts; I came to found A Church whose warrior-sons shall spread the news Of God's eternal kingdom far and wide, Till in the end this earth whereon we stand, This blood-stained earth, shall be a fitting place For God to dwell in: then will I return And reign thereon with thousands of the saints, And evil's form shall vanish. Mary. Lord, when thou Returnest thus with thousands of the saints, Let me be with thee; leave me not alone Within the starlit heavens, when earth is thus Made starlike by thy presence, Jesus. Nay, I speak Of unknown ages dim within the far Unfathomed future, but thy dreams are all Dreams of to-day. Yet rest thou well content: No lamb of all my flock but shall be safe Through all eternity, and all my lambs My hand shall lead for ever. Mary. I believe. Scene II. Street in Jerusalem. (Enter Judas). Judas. Here is the place appointed. Never lose A chance of winning friends, when friendship means The power to achieve your purpose. Man alone Is helpless, but two friends can sway the world Andâif one friend's a womanâheaven as well, With yawning hell beneath it. (To the Rabbi Ben-Aaron, who now enters). Greeting, Sir. (Mary enters on the opposite side of the stage, unseen by Judas and Ben-Aaron, and listens). Ben-Aaron. Hail, friendâyou guess my purpose? When one hates The mind is quick, and keen to apprehend Hate in another, hatred of the same One person. You and I with equal hate Hateâ Judas. Jesus? Ben-Aaron. Just so. And we both desireâ Judas. The death of Jesus. Ben-Aaron. Not so fast, my friend! You're over-hasty, and you choose your words With brutal rashness. âDeath'sâ a gloomy word: I never use itânever think on death IndeedâI think of love and maidens' lips, But not of death and darkness. Choose your words, I pray you, with more niceness; you offend me. Judas. Nay! life's not long enough for mincing words With your damned learned caution. I'm a man Accustomed to steer straight towards certain ends. Ben-Aaron. Yes, Judas; but when steering straight implies The passage of your ship o'er dangerous shoals, Why then steer crookedâyou will sooner reach Your lawful end in that way. Judas. Lawful end! We two have nought to do with lawful ends; We hate and plot, that's all. Ben-Aaron. Nay! plotting means A thousand different things. I plot to found God's empire upon earth; I plot to bring To man God's own Messiah. Judas. Cease from lies. You plotâI also plotâto murder Jesus, The man whom Mary loves. Ben-Aaron. I said before Your rough words make me shiver. Pray be gentle! Judas. Wolf that you areâthe light within your eyes Means murder. Ben-Aaron. Nay, my very hasty friend, I mean not murderâbut the Jews mean murder. This man, this Jesus, hated by the priests, Will surely perishâat their hands, not mine (The Romans being the executioners)â Ifâif this one thingâif he can be brought To avow himself Messiah. Judas. Now I see. Your lamblike gentleness will charge itself With this most saintly task: you'll draw the man To his destruction, prating all the while Of God and heaven and goodness. Ben-Aaron. Is not that Better than shouting murder in the streets? Judas. Far better, doubtlessâso the end be reached. Ben-Aaron. Faint heart, how soon you tremble! If the end Be not reachedâif my plan at last should fail Through cowardice of Jesusâthen your plan Comes to the front. Judas. I have not any plan. Ben-Aaron. There, friend, your lying begins, in your eyes Lurks murder likewise, ready forth to spring Red-handed, at its moment. Judas. If I said I had a plan, what then? Ben-Aaron. Merely to say That I will treble what the high priest offers (You see, I've probed the matter), if your plan Succeeds where mine has failed. Judas. Most generous master, Too gentle even to utter murder's name, I take you at your word, and, more than this, Your plan will not succeedâI know the manâ He is not wrought for greatnessâheroes wade Through blood to empire, but this man will shed No man's blood save his own. Ben-Aaron. Still violent words! Step this wayâwe will ratify our bargain Half in advance (I'll be more generous still!) But, if you love me, no more murderous words; They make all life look dismal. Judas. Not a word! (Exeunt Ben-Aaron and Judas). Scene III. A rocky spot in the vicinity of Jesusalem. Rabbi Ben-Aaron pacing backwards and forwards, soliloquising. Ben-Aaron. The plot works badly. Who can trust a woman? I toiled with genius, and my genius wrought Well at the first; I lured the coy young maid Who would not hear my suit at Nazareth Up to Jerusalemâthere younger lips Pleaded my cause far better than my own. Mary succumbed to loveâwell backed by gold (Gold adds such charm to love)âa Roman won her, Won her, forsook her,âjust the usual tale: Then I stepped inâand lo! the coy young girl Was coy no longer; what a difference now Twixt Mary of Nazareth and the passionate Mary Who brought the Roman gallants to her feet! How much can love do in a little space: Foolish past words are those who would aspire To win a virgin's lipsâsuch lips are cold; Let others, younger men, have all the toil Of nobly training in the ways of love, Then step you in, and reap what they have sown âAs I stepped in, and won the prize at last. But oh Ben-Aaron, subtle wise Ben-Aaron, Lord of the world through knowledge which is power In heaven, on earth, beware now lest the prize Escape; of all things slippery far the most Softly elusive is a woman's heart. A woman's love through phase on phase proceeds: With passion it commencesâthen she is wooedâ With ardour she responds,âso for a season Passion is mutual; then she older grows; Pursued by man no longer, she pursues; She, wooed not by the young, must now in turn Pay court to youthâupon youth's fiery lips Imprint the kiss of woman's ripening passion;â Then this too fails her, change again succeeds; Next comes religion's hourâthe dormant force Of sentiment that sleeps in every woman Springs to the frontâshe now believes in heaven, In God, in saints, and she must yield her heart To some strong saintlike man who represents God, heaven, and future joys,âso it goes on; That, always, is the story. Now to-day My plans are baffled by this selfsame fact: I stole from Jesus Mary's youthful form, Both form and heart, succeeding there superbly; To-day he wins her backâto-day he wins With tenfold force in that the exultant hosts Of heaven are on his sideâI none the less Can fearless front the momentâif I fail, Then Judas' rougher method may succeed. But fail I shall notânay, did ever yet An atheist fail? Of all things strong I think An atheist is the strongest, for he wields The eternal weapons of the ephemeral God In whom the credulous sons of men believe, Plays on the faith of others like a harp, And draws forth witching music. Even so I, atheist, will defy this heaven-sent saint, Win back the woman, and destroy the man, For am I not Ben-Aaron? Softâhe comes; I've lured him forth, pretending that a man Lay sick and needed help. (Enter Jesus). Jesus. Where is the man? Ben-Aaron (bowing). The man is here, for I am sick at heart Seeing how redemption lingers. Oh, my son, That thou with Israel's future in thy hands Shouldst thus slow-footed loiter by the way! Why not proclaim thyself the true Messiah? All foes will cower before thee, all our race Will rally round thee, and thou shalt renew Onec more the glorious past of Israel. Eight years ago, in that strange desert spot By Jordan's banks, I set before thee things Of solemn priceless import: now again To-day Ben-Aaron opens all his heart To thee and craves an answer. Time is ripe; Unnumbered followers wait for thy command To flock to arms; Jerusalem will hear With wild fierce ardour their strong rallying cry; Thou shalt be lord of all our raceâit may be, Lord of the Roman worldâthen lord of man: A kingdom measureless may be thine own, And all if thou wilt do one simple thing, Trust me, me wise Ben-Aaronâfor I've gleaned In lonely places knowledge such as thou In thy young simple heart hast never dreamed of. Knowledge is God; there is no God but knowledge: Knowledge have I pursued for years on years, Climbing sure-footed o'er the arduous way That leadeth to the heights where knowledge dwells; Now have I found the God, and grasped his formâ Held in embrace, though mortal, him the vast Dim fluctuant form that from the eyes of men Recedes for ever,âI, a man, have found The eternal God, and now am one with him; For I have gathered in one eager brain All knowledgeâyea, I die not, being old, For knowledge is the everlasting life. And now I bring to thee my priceless stores Of knowledge, and I offer thee the whole Because I love theeâyea, I love thee well: I have no sonâbut thou shalt be my son, My well-beloved, if thou wilt hear my words And, using me for guide, wilt climb the hills Of knowledge, worshipping my God with me. Jesus. Knowledge is not the everlasting life, But love is God and everlasting life. Thou knowest not the Father, who reveals Not to the wise but to the humble soul The priceless secrets of eternity: Yea, therefore said I, âSuffer little children To come to meâforbid them not,â for these Have seen my Father's face, the face that hidden In ceaseless cloud-folds still evades the wise. Children have seen the Father: thou hast seen Not the true features of the Father-God, For thou hast wrecked thy soul to apprehend Not God but merely the grand works of God, The treasures in his palaceâthese are fair, Yet barter not the undying soul for these; The sun, the stars, the lilies of the field, These are the works of God, but not in these Is God supremely manifest,âhe speaks Not in the thunder, shines not in the rays Of fiery lightning, but in humble hearts He whispers, âI am love, and love is King.â Ben-Aaron. Knowledge is God: but wilt thou hear my words? The time is ripe; lose not the golden moment Once more I offer thee the help that surely Will lead thee on towards unexampled ends. For this thy miracles have paved the way: By signs the unthinking populace is led; Let but a star shoot glimmering o'er the sky, The brainless herds with trembling hearts predict Strange woes and ruin of citiesâuse thy skillâ Thou art, I know it, a cunning conjuror; Thy fame is now establishedâturn that fame To good account. Jesus. My weapons are not carnal, And this world's clamorous warfare is not mine. My kingdom, founded in the hearts of men, Shall outlast earthly kingdoms. Ben-Aaron. Thou believest In shadowy lives to come, but I believe In this the golden present. Jesus. Heaven and earth Shall pass away; my words shall never pass. Ben-Aaron. A thousand poets' tongues have said the same. Where are they now? Jesus. No noble work can die. Nay: ever it bears fruit. Ben-Aaron. Although the men Who wrought the work rot slowly underground, Preaching to worms and beetles! Give to me The gracious present with its sunny gleams; I leave your heaven with all its pallid ghosts To love-sick youths and maidens.âOnce again, And for the last time, wilt thou work with me, Delivering thus thy race? Jesus. To work with thee Were wholly to destroy the race I love, Nay more, would die to save, for thou art base And barren is base labour. I will toil Alone, will bear, alone, the griefs of all, The sins of all, till all men's griefs and sins Vanish when God from time's dim mountain-tops Speaks and leads forth the morning. Ben-Aaron. Then I speak! What is thy God to me? A stormier God Than thine within the eternal darkness dwells: His am I, him I serveâthe God who stirs The waves to madness, who blindfolds the stars With his own hands lest any star should lead One storm-tossed ship to haven; him I serve Whose heaven is gloom, whose heart from age to age Conceives and sends forth sorrow: though thy God Be love he is servant to a mightier Lord, The Lord who making man set deep in man The changeless love of sin that brings forth fruit Blood-red, and will for ever. Hate is God Behind thy God and o'er him, as the dark Follows and rules the light; thy God is weak Beside the strength of mine, for all the world Bears witness to the force of him who slays Or, slaying not, slowly tortures. Jesus. Yet the weak Can bring to nought the strong. The world is dark, And shall be dark for agesâtill the light I bring shall slowly penetrate the dark And change man's grief to gladness. I am light, And light shall vanquish gloom. Ben-Aaron. Thou dreamest, thou, That Mary loves thee, that her heart is changed. She is mine, not thine; not to the saint who saves A woman's soul through endless time belongs, But to the man who wins her girlish beauty. Take thou her soul, for I have won her lips, And these are safe from thy most saintlike touchâ In hell I will await her. Go thy way: Redeem the race of manâit needs redemption; Redeem thou Maryâfor she needs redemption; Then, if thou canst, redeem and save thyself For surely man shall slay theeâI, Ben-Aaron, Promise thee thatâfor thou hast striven to steal The one thing that for just one moment made A dark soul see the sunshine. (Exit Ben-Aaron). Jesus. Go thy way, For all ways lead to God, though those that man Chooses lead round through darkness. True it is That now the Lord of darkness rules the earth; This is his hour, the Father lets him rule; One fleeting moment onlyâfar beyond The darkness shine the unsullied hosts of stars, Though these may fade from vision orb by orb As darkness closes round me. Yet I trust. (Exit Jesus). Scene IV. âIn the Garden of Gethsemane. The night of Wednesday. Judas. You've met me here. For this at least I thank you. I know you deem me just a mere rough fellow, Enamoured as you are of pink-cheeked Jesus: That beardless subaltern in the ghostly army, That delicate lieutenant of the angels, Holds such a placeâI know itâin your heart That there's no room for rough and honest worth. But still you've met me. Mary. As I promisedâyes. Judas. I love youâalways have loved you. Will you kiss me? Mary. Remember, other men have loved meâpause; Are you content to take a cast-off beauty? You, Judas, such a peerless knight-at-arms, Who might win some untouched and spotless damsel, What, you put up with charms at second hand! My estate of beauty's heavily mortgagedâyes, Trespassing fingers have been busy there And stolen some flowers; I will be honest with you. Judas. When a man loves with strong true vigorous love He loves the womanâbody, soul, and spirit; He loves her for herself, not for her history. If you will let me taste your priceless kisses For nought save sheer mad love, what does it matter To whom in olden days you chose to sell them? By all God's heavenâif any God there be To hold those glimmering strange star-torches steadyâ When on your lips I cool the love I burn with, What will it matter then what happened before? Nay, I shall like you all the better for it, For I shall feel as if all other lovers Were husbands, and as if, each time we kiss, I robbed them of their rights with joyous laughter! But kiss me nowâthe starlight is not jealous. Mary. First tell meâI have much to ask youâlistenâ Judas. Listen? You chill the warm love on my lips. Mary. You have a grudge against the man who helped me When no man else would heed or help. Judas. Again! Again that man's nameâever must he come Between me and the only heaven I seek, The heaven whose starlight flashes from your eyes, Whose phraseless rapture your embrace contains. Mary. His heart is nobler than your heart can dream. Judas. You love himâall he dreams about is heaven: That pleases woman; when her lust's played out, She loves to dwell on thoughts that soothe the soul. The darkness suits her first, for in the dark Woman can sin her fill, fearless, unseen; Yea, crowd the darkness with as many lovers As there are kisses panting on her lips. But when her hours of fierce desire are over She'll change her mood, discover that the dark Is rich with golden stars, and to each star Tag on a moral meaning and a use: Yes, that is woman. Mary. All you know of her Is gathered from your own black loveless heart. You are of those who, having first degraded, Debauched, debased, then swear that God's hand made Woman as man's hand leaves her. Judas. If God made Woman, it must have been in some loose hour. Indeed I rather hold that tales I've heard Bandied among the learned Roman folk, Tales of their goddesses and gods, are true. It seems their Jupiter's a lecherous god: Aye, if the whole wide realm of heaven were pure, Full of pure gods, or pure and calm-browed men, Let but one fair sweet woman enter there âFair as thou art, with those soft child-eyes, Mary!â Soon resonant heaven would ring from side to side With orgy-songs and chants of wild desire, The gods would fling their sceptres to the stars To hold, and Jupiter no more would rule, For woman's spirit, the spirit of lust, would reign. How many lovers had you, ere this Jesus Stilled in you with his words the passion of earth And roused in you the passionate lust of heaven? Fifteen? Mary. Be sure of this, whatever men Loved me or said they loved me, never one True-hearted woman loved a snake like you. Judas. Snakeâsnakes are slippery things that twist and crawl; Women are more like snakes than men, methinks. Am I more snakelike than that soul of yours, That body of yours, which having tested first The souls and bodies of half a hundred men Now seek to recreate and rest themselves And win again some savours as of youth, Some sense of freshness, in the arms of this Enamoured foolish youth of Galilee? Snake! Snake thou art, and wilt be to the end. What is more snakelike than to seek to drag Down to thy level with all thy mincing ways, Thy harlot's tricks, thy lying floods of tears, Thy false repentance, one who though I hate, Hate him for thy sake, curse him and would slay him, Is still a prince of men? Mary. But if I said I loved you after all, and was but playing At love with Jesusâwell, what would you say? Judas. Are you in earnest? Mary. Am I in earnest! Come, Come nearerâtake this kissâa woman's proof. Judas. Your angry words? Mary. Mere childish pettish things! What, you a man, and heed the words of woman! Oh, woman's words are wayward as the wind, Lighter than lightest tuft of thistledown: Her anger's just a sudden lightning gleam That flashes forth, then passes, nothing more. Judas. Your eyes flashed more than mere ephemeral wrath. Mary. The eyes that flashed with ire can flash with passion. Judas. You called me a snake. Mary. But snakes are lovely things. Have you not seen their supple bodies twine Round a girl's neck with amorous caresses? Judas. A man's hot anger does not cool so soon. Mary. Judas, you are a very child in love. What, know you not that when a woman loves She hates, aye loathes, herself at times for loving, Rebels against the slave within herself, Rages against the man to whom she's slave, And just because she never will be free Exults in playing at freedom? Know you not . . Your lips againâand closer . . know you not That, when a woman loves, she sometimes shakes And tests the chains she is content to wear Andâjust for the sweet sake of being masteredâ Pretends to master him whom she would serve. Now tell me, friendâI long to hear t toldâ What is your plan? I know you have a plan For baffling Jesus and his followers And, being yours, the plan is doubtless wise. You should have told me of it; I was nettled, Angryâwhat woman likes being left i' the dark? âJudas keeps secrets from me;â so I saidâ âThen Judas cannot love me; I could never, Loving a man, keep secrets hidden from him.â Tell me your secret? Judas. Will you swear to keep The thing I tell you deep within your soul, Buried in silent darkness? Mary. I will swear To utter it to no man. (Aside) Is not Jesus A God and not a man? I have not lied. Judas. Listen! The die is cast. To-morrow night Jesus will watch within Gethsemane. Some mere half-dozen disciples will be there, All cowards, powerless any of them to aid. The rulers and the chief priests all are with me: Pilate will be won over, for the Romans, Distrustful in this turbulent city, dread The effect of Jesus' doctrines on the Jews; They are ripe for a revolt, for these strange doctrines Are spreading widely, and, in fact, this man Has focussed all the people's discontent: A thousand swords would do less keen-edged harm Than this man's single tongue, for now that he Proclaims himself the prophet who should come All who would thrust aside the Roman yoke Are eager to ally themselves with him. This Pilate sees; his dread is fairly roused; And, though he has the Roman stern contempt (I share it!) for our nation's petty squabbles, In his own interest he is bound to act. The arguments the priests will bring to bear Cannot but move himâthey will argue thus: âThis man, this Jesus, calls himself a King, King of the Jewsâwe have no king but CÃ¦sar; Jesus proclaiming that he is a King Is traitor to Tiberiusâhe defies And tramples on the imperial power of Rome; If thou supportest Jesus, look to it!â So they will argue, and it follows clearly Pilate must listen to themâelse he falls. In this way all will work together well: Romans and priests, our laws, the Roman laws, The Roman jealousy of self-made kings, Our Jewish hatred of a self-made prophet, Pilate, the Sanhedrim, your servant Judasâ We all shall work together for one end, The downfall of this man who won your heart And drew your burning gaze from earth to heaven Not that I would pretend that Ananias, Myself, the priestly throng, and Caiaphas, Are wholly in earnest, wholly patriotic: We use the Roman Governor as a tool, To you I avow it,âyes, I avow it freely. In fact, we care about as much for CÃ¦sar As CÃ¦sar cares for Father Abraham. Still, CÃ¦sar's most convenient for our purpose, So you will hear us all, no doubt, to-morrow With one voice shouting, âLong live noble CÃ¦sar! Let all the enemies of CÃ¦sar die! This man's an enemyâso to death with Jesus!â To-morrow night a guard will be collected: This I shall lead unto Gethsemane; There Jesus doubtless will be prayingâwatching The stars, not dreaming of the rays that flash Keener than star-rays from the Roman sword-points. He praysâwe wiselier actâall for the good, The good, mind you, of the sublime tradition Handed straight down from Moses and the Prophets. Well, when we find him praying, I shall steal Silent upon him, take him unawares, Kiss him upon the forehead (not the lipsâ To you I leave the lips) and say, âHail, Master!â That is the signal, duly preconcerted. Then they will seize him, bindâif he resistsâ And drag him to the house of Ananias. After inquiryâbriefâconducted there They'll take him to the house of Caiaphas Where he will find the Sanhedrim assembled (All's nobly planned) and there with show of trial A formal sentence of death will be pronounced, Which Pilate will be bound to ratify And which, with his approval, will be carried In some few short hours into execution. Is all quite plain? Mary. Indeed, you have plotted well. The air strikes cold. I must be moving hence. Judas. You'll meet me againâyou'll give me what I long for? Mary. I'll meet you again. Judas. Why should we part to-night? Would not to-night be fittest for our love? To-morrow there'll be business to attend to. May I not win reward for all my toil Within those arms of yours, whose soft embrace By heaven I swear shall never gladden Jesus! Draw back among the bushes. Mary. Not to-night. I'm tired to-night, but when to-morrow's over . . Who knows then what may happen? Now good-night. (Exit Mary). Judas. I think I've won her, but a woman's wayward, Best not to count upon herâI'll away To Miriam's house, the hot young jade expects me. A long night's practice at the kissing trick May be of use, and Miriam's mouth is sweet, Though queenlier, doubtless, are the lips of Mary. (Exit Judas). Scene V. Another part of Gethsemane. (The night of Thursday. Jesus alone). Jesus. Yea, love is sweet, and love is pureâGod made Woman for helpmate, not for curse and snare. I know that Mary loves me; I have saved Her soul from devilish thraldom worse than death, Thraldom of fiends, and baser yoke of man: Her eyes, through which the eyes of devils gleamed, Have won the royal look of woman now, The royal look of love my Father set Within the eyes of woman, whom he made That through her soul his soul might flash on man Light lovelier than the light of stars or sun. Yes, I have saved her: may I not possess The thing I save, and seal it as mine own? Must I, alone upon the mountain-side Seek through the silent portals of the night My Father's face, when it may be the way Lies nearer, even the road to heaven and home, Through woman's love,âwhen, it may be, her hands Are readiest to unbar the eternal gates. âAnd yet it may be in the years gone by, Epochs of life now wholly past from sight, The perfect love of woman was mine own. It may be then I loved as others love And won as others win; it may be, then, Some girl with dark hair darker than the night, Eyes brighter than the night's whole wealth of stars, Loved me as men are loved,âthat I possessed As men possess, and when the morning came Forgot the dawn while gazing in her face, Yea, wondered that the morning ever came. So sweet a joy being left within the night. (Enter Mary, unseen by Jesus. She listens). This well may be: it may be I have grown Through lives past number to a higher life Wherein a nobler love first feels its way Towards statelier realms of mysteries unseen. I give up love to win a priceless love, Love beyond measure, love that shall not die But mix itself with passion of the years And mingle with the ages yet to be. No woman through all time but shall be glad Through me: I take, as it were, the stars of night Unnumbered, endless, and with these I crown The future; never in one most distant land With evil cities, through whose dismal streets Still as of old the lost sad women go, Never in any city of furthest time Shall any poor lost woman heavenward lifting Her soul in sorrow fail to feel some throb Responsive from my soul within the sky: To even the saddest I will say, âRejoice!â For even the humblest I will save a star. Mary (advancing towards Jesus). But, Lord, the common paths of love are sweet: With weary heart man struggles on alone, But woman gives him ardour for the fray, Force for the combat; when the combat's o'er, Woman can bring him rest unspeakable. Me thou hast saved from the wild lusts of men, The passions that destroyânow let me in turn Save thee from evil men who would destroy: The path to safety is open stillâto-night If thou wilt fly with me, we can escapeâ I know the roadâand in the mountains hide Till all the clamour of pursuit is o'er. Then I will be thy faithful servitor, Thy sister, friend, thine handmaid, what thou wilt âI love thee, Lordâand I will follow thee, And thou shalt teach me secrets of the stars And of God's holy heaven beyond the stars Wherein in spirit thou dwellest, for I know Thou art the king of whom our prophets spake, The spotless just Messiah who should come. Jesus. Mary, thou lovest, and thy soul is true, But yet thou understandest not my heart. The love of earth is sweet, but sweeter love Than thou hast dreamed of shall one day be thine. I came from God to hallow earthly love: Thou sawest this when, nine long years ago, I blessed the marriage at Cana, giving wine For waterâthat is how my Father gives; Yea, ever he bestows a nobler gift Than that men crave forâman would ask one star, But lo! God crowds the heaven with countless stars âLook up; above us through the purple sky The golden endless constellations gleam. And so it is with love: a love more deep Than man has dreamed of, or than woman dreams, Shall be the lot of woman and of man. Mary. I love thee, Lord. Jesus. Thou deemest that thou lovest, But love is grander than thy loftiest dreams. Listen:âlong ages since in other lands I lived; my spirit that here on earth to-day Clothed in this flesh thou seest, in other forms Hath dwelt: it ne'er began, it hath no end. Straight from the bosom of the Father-God My spirit sprang, but in full many a form On earth 'twas forced to live that I might learn All lessons needful, conquer lower aims, Lower desires, until at last I won The everlasting strength of soul whereby The world shall be redeemed from sin and death. Thou, too, hast lived: aye, we have met before. Mary. Before, my Master? Jesus. We have met before, And thou hast loved me in far other days. Yea, Mary, when I drew thy soul to mine Through very force of love, didst thou not feel That that strange power which softened and renewed Was just the sense of former love revived? Thou art mine, because thou never hast been aught But mine; thy lips were mine, as virgin-pure As the first dew-drop drawn up by the sun, Ages before Jerusalem was built: Yea even on other stars, diversely wrought From this small wayward star whereon we stand, Our spirits in other forms have met and loved. And now to-day I lift thee and redeem; I purge away thine intervening guilt, For thou hast left me, Mary, and hast sinnedâ I purge away thy guilt of years, thy strange Adultery of the ages vast, unknown; I draw thee back to me for thou art mine. But not in any earthly fashion of love Shall now our souls be one: we have reached a point At which the mist-clad dreams of ages past May melt in air and vanishâgolden-clear Upon the darkling background of my death Shines our accomplished love's eternal dawn. One we have been, and shall be, but the road Lies through the darkness. Yet believe in me. Mary. Lord, I believeâbut when thou diest, if this Indeed must be, let me too follow thee, Let me die with thee; if, as thou dost say, Our lives in other lands, in other years, Have been one life, let not those lives to-day By any touch of death or touch of man Be rent apart, dissevered; when the crowd Of soldiers led by Judas comes for thee (Aye, even now I fancy through the dark I see their torches gleam) Let me die firstâlet some rough soldier's spear Thee seeking pierce my bosom, that the blood Forth-flowing, plenteous from the gaping wound, May wash me clean from that adultery Whereof thou speakest, and restore my soul Maiden in death and spotless to my Lord. Jesus. Nay, Mary, as through all the ages past I, loving thee as no soul else will love, Have ever led thee along the upward roadâ The road that seeks the untrodden mountains first, Then, when these are surmounted, still aspires Beyond the trodden mountains to the stars By foot of man untrodden, unrevealed To eyes of manâso let it be to-day. Again I show the road, and though it lead Far past all mountains, and beyond the stars, Even through death's darkness, where the Father's hand That holds the stars may for a moment seem To cease to uphold and guide me, still I know My Father even in the darkness rules, And though the fiends of hellâwho will resent The world's supreme redemption through my deathâ May round me gather in a lurid throng, Or, if death's horror take another form More dread, more awful, silence of the void Press with a speechless terror on my brain And through that silence ring one lonely cry âThere is no God,â then all be still once more, Though this be so, yet even without the stars Upon the Father's starlike soul I rest, Even in the silence wait till he shall speak. Mary. They come. (She flings her arms round Jesus and waits, gazing in the direction of the torches). Scene VI. Antechamber in the house of Ananias. Peter sits warming himself at a fire. Miriam, Rebecca, and Anna, waiting-maids of Ananias, move about conversing. Confused sound of voices from the hall within. (Enter Mirza, excited and breathless). Mirza. Do you know what's happened? It's come off at last, The great event we all have been predictingâ Jesus is seized. Miriam. Of course he isâhe's here (pointing to the inner chamber). Mirza. One woman struggled wildly with the soldiersâ ('Twas Mary Magdalene, the courtesan; You know her, girlsâwho in this town does not?) Her face and neck were bleeding from their blows: They flung her roughly aside, then pounced on Jesus; The man resisted not,ânot half a man, I thinkâI would at least have scratched their eyes! They bound him, led him hereâyou know the rest. Anna. And what of Mary? Mirza. Mary? She was left Half lifeless on the ground; one soldier stooped And once more struck her. Rebecca. Well, it served her right; Who asked her help, I wonder? (Addressing Miriam) Somewhat changed, This woman, from the sunny-featured girl Who by that crystal fount at Nazareth Sang to usâyou remember? Miriam. I remember. In those old days she only saw the flowers Beside the stream of love, but now she knows That stream has waves blood-red . . and yet . . and yet . . Rebecca, I could find it in my heart To envy herâher life has been a dream Of love and passionâall the world of man Sighs at her feet. Rebecca. The dream is over now: She loves, and love brings anguish. Anna (addressing Mirza and pointing to Peter). Was not he With Jesus? Mirza. Yes. Miriam. I know him. Oftentimes I've seen the curious couple pass our door âOh! how my cheeks have ached with laughing at themâ Peter and Jesusâfollowed by a troop Of girls I would not look at; jades whose faces Would scare away the very boldest man, So they must turn to the angelsâlast resource. Well, it's all over now, their dream of heaven! Better have let the next world quite alone And spent a joyous time in thisâwhat say you, Rebecca? Rebecca. That you're rightâI also have seen them. You're right all round: I hold that life was given To girls for pleasureâthat God made the sun Bravely to shine along their yellow hair And turn the lustrous loose locks into gold; The stars to give them light to find their lovers, The sweetest flowers that lovers' tongues might say, âNo flower hath half the sweetness of your breath!â Mirza. Rebecca, you're poetic! If the sun Can turn our lustrous loose locks into gold It is that gold hair may be as a net Wherein the eager hands of men may fling Their gold and silver, jewels, and the likeâ How I love trinkets!âIf I were with Jesus Oh he should work a miracle for me, Change all the stars to jewels and hang them all Round the smooth ivory pillar of my neckâ Then I would love him! Anna. I would love him too If he would work a miracle for me, Remove these freckles and this loathsome mole That mars my neck's soft whitenessâlook, it spreads Its brown misshapen hideous patch just hereâ Below my dress, that's fortunate, though Mirza, There are occasions whenâ Mirza. The mole is seen. Anna. Yes: Japhet said the other night he thought It was a crawling spiderâhow I hated The mole and Japhet too! Mirza. Japhet's brown face Would match the mole. Anna. Japhet's brown face! I think His face is godlike; as to Ephraim's face It's nothing better than a pimply mass. Miriam. Soft now, don't quarrelâlet us ask this man, This Simon PeterâCephas, as they call himâ Let's ask him each in turnâdon't let him hear Our whispersâlet us ask him each in turn Whether he was with Jesus, 'twill be sport To see him blush and stammer. (To Peter). Sir, were you With Jesus? Surely I saw you in the garden? Peter. I was not in the garden. Rebecca. I have heard That you are chief among this man's disciples? Peter. I am not of his followers. Mirza. But I saw With my own eyes your right hand draw your sword And with it strike good Malchus. Peter. Curse you, cease Your chattering follyâI tell you once for all I never knew the man. Anna. Hark! what an hour For cocks to crow; this bird has sense to opine That somewhat strange is stirring. (Exit Peter). Rebecca (watching Peter from the window). He's crying! What a soft-heart thing it is; First lies to save reputeâthen sorry for it. Come, girlsâlet's turn our thoughts towards cheerier swains Than these disciples of a man whose eyes Are girlish, Mirza, as yours, and not so bright, Nor with that lurking flash of mischief in them. Miriam. They're bringing Jesus outâsee, quick Rebecca! How pale the poor soul looks! They'll take him now Straight, doubtless, to the house of Caiaphas; Let's follow and mark the end! (Exeunt GIRLS, following the crowd that accompanies Jesus to the house of Caiaphas). SCENE VII. Room in the house of Caiaphas where the Sanhedrim are assembled.âA mixed crowd of excited people pressing in at the doors, and listening eagerly.âAfter awhile Peter enters cautiously, and watches from a distance. Caiaphas. We have heard three witnesses, and all their speech Tallies; there can no longer be a doubt That this man's followers, rough, illiterate, base, Were growing a danger to the city's peace. Disturbance on disturbanceâin the streets And in the Temple's courts! aye, surely next The Roman stalwart arm will interfere (Just to keep orderâsaying that we cannot) âThen blood will flow, and all because of this Proud-browed impetuous self-styled Son of God! This must not be: we have heard good Eleazar Salathiel's son, the seller of oil and wine There in the Temple's courtsâwe have heard besides Aminadab who sells the snow-white doves And Talan, money-changer, son of Pharez:â These all deposeâaye, with one voice deposeâ That Jesus, shouting through the Temple Courts Ran, using violent gestures, violent words; Thenâmore than gestures, wordsâthat Jesus seized Their stalls and overturned them, spilt their oil, Scattered their money, and set free their doves (That straightway fluttered forth with eager wings), Saying, âMy Father's house was built for prayer, But ye have made that house a den of thieves:â Moreâthen he made a small keen scourge of cords And with that scourge he drove with furious zeal Talan, Aminadab, and all the rest Far from the Temple's precincts. (Turning to the Court). Ye have heard: What think ye of this man? Priests and Elders (with one voice). He stands condemned. Caiaphas. Yet is there further witness; next we call Rabbi Jephunnehâhe, of good repute, Proved worthy through long years of highest esteem, Versed in the law of Moses, learned, wise, Hathâso we hearâapt evidence to tender On this the matter in hand. (Enter Jephunneh the Pharisee). Thou art welcome, friend. Speakâwithout fearâthe cause of holiest truth Clamours for aid. Jephunneh. But if my witness bears Too hard upon him? mercy in my soul Wrestles with justice; I am soft of heart, Too soft, I know itâyet the man is poor, His friends are poor,âit may be that the man Will yet recant, abjure his dangerous creed, Cease to stir up the passions of the mob, Becomeâwho knows?âa sober citizen. Caiaphas. Nay, bear thy witness,âtime is past for this. Pity, though fair and bounteous, has its day, Then steps forth justiceâjustice stern and fair, Fairer than pity. Jephunneh. Then you bid me speak? Caiaphas. Speak. Jephunneh. Once I saw this Jesus in the fields: 'Twas on a Sabbath day, the sun shone bright, And all creation restedâas the Lord Upon the seventh day rested from his toil. Jesus and his disciples wandered through The golden corn-fields, and I met them there; His followers plucked the golden ears of corn And rubbed them in their handsâpoor hungry folk! (Here pity speaks again; I stamp it down)â They ground in greedy hands the ears of corn And made a sorry meal; I straightway spake, For all my righteous Pharisaic zeal Was kindled hot within meââWhy do these Thy followers thus profane the Sabbath day?â Then this man: âHold thy peace, nor interfere. I know thee, lying false-heartâthou art one Of that smug-featured strait-laced viperous crew Who in God's name defile the world of God, Making creation hideous as themselves.â (You start? I give you Jesus' very words; My memory's goodâthus he continued) âLiar Thou art; thy fathers slew the prophetsâthou Dost build their sepulchres; through sea and land To win one proselyte thy swift steps go, Then, having gained him, thou dost make him more, Yea twofold, threefold more, the child of hell Than thou thyself art: thou dost pray long prayers, Thou hypocriteâthou cleansest cups and platters But thou within art full of dead men's bones And all uncleaness.â Such were this man's words! I answered not: I never answer violence. Then he resumedââThe Sabbath day was made For man, not man for any Sabbath day Though called of Moses holy; I proclaim To man the newer Sabbath, even the day Of love and freedom and sweet fellowship That shall annul thy Sabbath.â Then he turned Aside with one long glance of withering scorn And his disciples turnedâthey, jeering, turnedâ They trampled through the corn, they plucked the corn In golden handfuls and they flung them, scoffing, Full in my face. Caiaphas. No moreâthou hast said enough. We thank thee for thy kindly courtesy And for thy true strong witness. (To the Usher of the Court). Call Ben-Aaron. (The Usher calls Ben-Aaron. Ben-Aaron enters). Caiaphas. We know thou art indeed most erudite And, also, this man's friend, but yet thy zeal For truth and law will outweigh, will it not, The claims of friendship even? Speak the truth: Thou shalt be then repaid by truth's own joy And by high dealing's sweetness,âyea, the God Of all our fathers shall be glad of thee, Thou with God's blessing gladdened. What thou knowest Speak clearly, friend, and fully. Ben-Aaron. I will speak. This man was once my friend: I loved him wellâ In his bright youth I loved him, and I grieved, Wept with his parents, at the unseemly sight Of his completest downfall, for he chose Low base companions, held erroneous views That shocked all those who loved him; not the death Of John was warningâno, the mantle of John Fell on his shouldersâhe conceived no doubt, John once removed, that every obstacle To his Messiahship was swept away, So from that moment he with eager joy Posed as Messiah and Saviour of the race. Little by little healthy-minded folk Drew off from him; his followers soon became A motly gathering, an ill-omened crew Of publicans and harlotsâaye, of thieves, For what are those who seek to rob the rich For the base lazy poor but arrant thieves, Bandits and robbers? When this Jesus preached His gospel to the poor, he drew the crowd (As preachers such as he in every age Have drawn the crowd) by promising to spend Freely the wealth of others for their sakes: Plunder, swift plunder, plunder sure and large, Such was the bait he held before the crowd And they like eager-hearted hungry fish Rose at it; then the harlots likewise rose, Rose at their baitâthe bait of hopeful days Held out before them, days in which to walk In silk apparel, rendering back contempt Most brazen-faced to those pure-minded folk Who hitherto had scorned them; modest worth, Quite at a discount, could attract no moreâ No, rags and sin were at a premium now. With men like these and women such as these Did this man pass his days, and then, besides, Glaring imposture, practised in broad day, Haunted his steps, and he connived at it (ConnivedâI use a charitable word; Others might doubtless choose an uglier term). What was this raising, but the other day, Raising of Lazarus, and the blind men healed At Jerichoâwhat were these cases, friends, (turning round, and facing the Court) But gross imposture practised in the name Of God profaned for private purposes? The dead man, Lazarus, is alive and strong, Myself have seen himâspoken since his death To LazarusâLazarus never died at all; Mere catalepsyâfrom his deathlike trance Jesus aroused him, and the thing became Forthwith a miracle to vulgar folk For whom all things, all deeds of every day, Brim o'er with marvel. Then again the woman In foul adultery seized, who should have been (But was not) stonedâa grosser case than this Ne'er laughed in justice' face: the woman's name Was Timna (concubine to Eliphaz, The son of Esauâjust that very nameâ History repeats itself!)âshe was not stoned As Moses bade us, so the jade survives To mislead others, yea to draw strong men To their destruction with her mincing ways That should have ceased for everâthen again (This damns the man, if ever yet a word Could damn the utterer) Jesus said to meâ I vouch for thisâhe said, âI will destroy Your Temple made with hands, and in three days Raise up anotherââ Caiaphas. Peace. (Aside) The thing is ripe. (Aloud) Few further words are needed. (Turning to Jesus). Answer this, And answer truthâArt thou the Son of God? Jesus. I am; and, likewise, all who love the Father Shall be the sons of God. Caiaphas (rending his clothes). What further need Have we of witnessesâye hear him speak? Hath he not spoken blasphemy? Crowd of Priests and Elders. He hath. Caiaphas. What fate deserves he? He who thus puffed up, Thus egotistic even to madness' point, Before a grave assembly such as ours Dares mock the historic faith, sneer at the Law, And, adding blasphemy to his former crimes, Now calls himself God's Son? Priests and Elders. The man must die. Caiaphas (mockingly). The Son of God must die! Now lead him forth. During the night let him be closely watched, Then brought at morning's first convenient hour To Pilate, who shall ratify our sentence. It shall be carried out in Roman form, Although by Moses' law he should be stoned; But I have ever held it right and fit To honour Roman customs.âNone the less, That justice may be perfect, let him speak If aught the man would utter. Jesus. All is well. Now shall I pass beyond your swords and spears, Beyond thy foolish tongue, thou mocking judge, Back to the holy heaven from which I came To judge with righteous judgement all the world. I came from God, now back to God I go, But yet on earth my spirit shall ever live, Deathless, divine, unconquered: tell ye CÃ¦sar That, though the world lies bowed beneath his feet, I stand with foot upon his neck to-day; I whom your laws condemn to suffer death, Am lord of all the worldâaye, lord of Rome, King of Jerusalem, the Son of God, Messiah whom the prophets have foretold, And, more than all, the suffering Son of man. For man is mine, man's future all is mine; My empire is not bounded as is Rome's By rivers, forests, and the bridgeless seas: CÃ¦sar a poor small straitened empire sways; My empire is co-equal with the world, Commensurate with the long march of time, Based on the affections, stablished in the heart, Eternal, vast, supreme, impregnable:â Aye, followers who shall sign upon their brows And on their children's brows the cross for sign Shall rule imperial Rome, and in my name Traverse the seas until they find a land Circled by storm-winds, guarded by the waves, Wherein my Church shall flourish, spreading wide Its branches East and West and North and South Like some well-watered fruitful growing tree Beneath whose shadow all the world shall rest. That is my future. From the cross that now Your hands prepare, I shall for ever reign. Stone upon stone Jerusalem shall fall; Each word the prophets spake shall be fulfilled; Your tribes shall all be scattered through the earth, Yea, by the sword all ye who sought the sword Shall surely perish, but my soul shall live, Live in the hearts first of the chosen few Whom I commission in my name to preach The wondrous gospel of the love of God First to mine own and then to every land, Live in their hearts, and then in hearts of all Who shall believe on me through this their word. I, mightiest lord of all the kings of men, I, coming forth from God, return to God; But, ere my soul reseeks the starry road And traverses the silence of the night, I, having first unlocked the golden gate That leads past all the stars to God's high throne, Hand to my faithful followers the keyâ (turning towards Peter, who gazes tearfully at his Master). Peter, take thou the key: Thou art a rock, and on this rock I build My Churchâthe hosts of hell shall not prevail Against it; this I do in token of love For, though thou didst deny me but just now, Thou shalt bear witness yet before the world That I am in truth thy Master and thy King. Peter. My Master and my King. Crowd. Away with him! Caiaphas. Ye have spoken rightly. Lead the man away, Lest further blasphemy from reckless lips Damage his cause, and shock the Lord of heaven. (Jesus is led away, closely guarded). SCENE VIII. The Judgment Hall of Pilate. Pilate and Jesus alone. Pilate. Speak. Tell me plainlyâI love clear plain wordsâ What mean these people by their strange reports? Art thou the King of the Jews? Jesus. Sayest thou this Of thine own self, or comes the thought from others? Pilate. Waste not thy time in quibbling, time is precious: Knowest thou not, friend, that with me lies the power To crucify thee, or to set thee free? Jesus. Thou couldest have no power at all against me Were not that power first given thee from above; He therefore that delivered me to thee Is the chief culprit, hath the greater sin. Pilate. Am I a Jew? What is the affair to me? I am sick of settling Jewish petty squabbles. We have a hundred lordly gods at Rome, Strong gods, fair goddesses,âthy race proclaims Its vaunted worship of the eternal One, And yet, by Hercules, it seems to me Our muddle of gods gives, after all, less trouble Than the Jews' matchless One! What thinkest thou? Jesus. The Father speaks not through our race alone: He sends his sun to shine on every land. Pilate. Thou sayest this! Thy doctrine, so they said, Was harsh, fanaticalâBelievest thou In Rome and Rome's old gods? Jesus. Wherever man With true heart worshippeth, he finds the Father. Pilate. What meanest thou? Who is this Father-God? The Jove whose godship lightens upon Rome? Jesus. My Father's image no man's eyes have seen. He dwelleth not in temples made with hands; His shrine is 'mid the everlasting stars, Orâin the heart that loves him. Pilate. I begin To understand why thine own people hate thee. Why, thou art half lucretian in thy creed! Priests hate a liberal creed, and narrower priests Than those who scowl and prowl and practise here Ne'er cumbered earth. I find no fault in thee Save that thou causest tumult in the streets And in the Temple's courtsâlet that but cease, There seems no further just cause to condemn thee. But drop thy kingly title; that excites The ravening jealousy of priests and scribes And lashes them to madness. Jesus. I am king, King of the Jews, but in no earthly sense. If I were king in any earthly sense, Then would my servants fight; now is my kingdom Unseen, remote, unearthly. Pilate. Yet again Thou speakest riddles. Jesus. For this cause I cameâ To bear eternal witness to the truth. He who is of the truth will hear my voice And follow me. Pilate. Thou dreamer, what is truth? (Voices outside). Crucify him! Crucify him! Pilate. Hearest thou the voices of the curs who clamour For thy heart's blood? And yet if any wayâ Last night my wife in troubled slumber saw Thy face; she gazing from Antonia's tower Beheld that scuffle in the Temple's Court When thou didst overturn their merchandise,â She, knowing thee thus by sight, beheld thy face Last night in sleep, and troublous was the dream. Antonia's tower with thunderous crash downfell; Next blazed the Temple in a thousand spires Of eddying flame that stained the night blood-red; Arms clashed on every side, and wild shouts rang; Through this proud city's gates our soldiers stormed,â Wading through gore, they entered the doomed city. Then followed ravin, spoliage, murder, lust, Such as a thousand cities have endured Prostrate neath Roman soldiers' maddened hands, This city never. Then through cloud on cloud Of smoke and dust and blood the morning broke, And thou, within the chariot of the sun Sitting, didst gaze with icy calmness down Saying, âThus am I avenged on priests and people; Thus hath their city fallen!â This was her dream. (Voices outside). Crucify him! Crucify him! If thou let this man go, thou art not CÃ¦sar's friend. Whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against CÃ¦sar. Pilate. Hast thou no other word to say? Jesus. Not one. Pilate (going to the window). I wash my hands of it. See ye to this. Voices. On us, and on our race, his blood shall be; On us, and on our children. Pilate. Be it so. (He calls for the guard of SOLDIERS. They enter). Take ye him forthâand let them have their will. (Exeunt SOLDIERS, leading Jesus away to be crucified). Pilate (alone). A mad strange matterâand that dream of hers? There's something doubtless in his youthful face That wins its way with women. Poor young Jew! And yet not all a Jew; he spoke out bravely, With heartfelt clear contempt for Jewish creeds. For that they'll murder him: we Romans fight, Quarrel and slay for love's sake, for a woman, But these weird dark-eyed narrow-chested men Fight for a God their eyes have never seen, For his sake slay each other. Let them be! (Exit Pilate). END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. âThe King of the Jews.â Scene I. âThe hill of Calvary. Mary Magdalene and Judas standing near the Cross. Mary. Now all your work is done: the man is dead. Judas. Deadâdead at last, but you and I live on. Mary. You have gained your endâand yet the man was young! His cold still face seems beautiful in death: How white it is! save for the streaks of blood That glitterâblood that trickled from the thorns. Have you no pity in you? Judas. Not a jot! Mary. Well, all is over now. When shall we meet? Judas. To-night. A man's hot blood brooks no delay. Mary. To-night! with deathâand such a death as thisâ Pale at the entrance of our bridal room? Judas. Ayeâdeath or no death, love's a priceless thing. The death of Jesus has not dimmed your lips It has not stolen from your eyes the fireâ Hope flashes through them still with living gleam. Mary (aside). Hope! (Aloud) To-night then be it; best it should be soon. Judas. Where will you meet me? Mary. In Gethsemane. (Exit Judas). (Enter Ben-Aaron). Ben-Aaron. âWhat, gazing on the cross! How strange it is That women's souls exult in tragic deedsâ That they, being full of sweetness like the flowers, Should love the midnight, not the morning sun, For here 'tis dark as midnight! What a gloom Broods o'er the landâthe uncultured heart would say It was of evil omen. Mary. Death and gloom Are not all evil; for the pure in heart There is no darkness, but eternal light Whose rays divide the gloomâfor evil-doers Darkness is fitting shroud. Ben-Aaron. Was this man then An evil-doer, in that thus the gloom For his sake shrouds the earth? Mary. Nay, darkness falls Upon the earth that this, man's greatest crime, May be concealed from angels' pitying gaze. The dark deed brings the darkness. Ben-Aaron. I am glad Of heartâthou knowest itâfor I loved thee well. Man's heart is gladdened when a rival dies; Aye, for each pang the dying rival feels, He feels a new swift throb of ecstacy. But (drawing her apart) listenâthis wayâI would speak with thee. Mary (aside). More love, I doubt not! What are men indeed But loversâof a kind! They would rage on With their mad lust, though round them stone by stone The massy ramparts of this earth should crumble, Letting wild darkness in. (Aloud) What is your wish? Ben-Aaron. The old desireâthe sweet desire of youth That through my veins runs tingling at the sight Of your young beauty. Many and many a day We have not met,âbut I have not forgotten: The young forget; the old, with fewer joys, Never forgetânor could man, young or old, Who once had touched the blossom of your lips Forget their matchless sweetness. Mary, listen! I am not all evil; though I hated him (pointing to the figure on the Cross) Thee I have loved far better than my soul, Better than God or heavenâif these indeed Be aught save men's wild fancies. Jesus there Hangs paleâforget himâfor he loved thee not: Self was his ruler, self in royal robes And crowned with lovely godship. 'Tis not so With me; my heaven would be thy dwelling-place Though no God's light illumined it, and my hell The bright heaven where thou wert not. Mary. (Aside) Still the same! Man's heaven is ever in a woman's arms, His rapture on her lips, till arms and lips Grow oldâthen they seem hell-like. (Aloud) And your wish? Ben-Aaron. Once more to hold your glory in embrace And feel myself renewedâas darkness feels, When sunset's passive splendour slowly sinks Deep in recipient night's dark tremulous arms. Mary. There'll be no sunset; all around is gloom. Ben-Aaron. No gloom where thou artâMeet me once again, Just once, for I have loved thee. Mary. Only once? Ben-Aaron. But once, I swear itâand I'll give to theeâ Mary. No gifts!âMy life has had enough of gifts, Enough of gifts and givers. Ben-Aaron. Then withoutâ For love's sake only. Shall it be to-night? Mary. To-night. Ben-Aaron. You'll meet me? Mary. In Gethsemane. (Exeunt). Scene II. The Garden of Gethsemane. Evening of the same day (Friday). (Enter Judas). Judas. At last I win herâtriumph such as this I think ne'er fell to lot of man before; Triumph by day, and tenderer bliss by night. First in the day to see one's foe fall dead âKing of the Jews!âa thorn-wreath for his crownâ Robbers on left and rightâhis royal guard The Roman soldiers with their mocking jeersâ Deridedâspat uponâa kingly King?â First in the day to see one's enemy fall, Then in the night when all the stars shine forth A joy that might dismount them from their thrones In airy space and bring them down to earth With envious hearts that covet mortal bliss. Now I shall knowâas I have longed to knowâ What sweet strange poison lurks in Mary's lips, Poison that coursing through the enfevered veins Of young Tibullus two short months ago Drove him to madness, till he clean forgot Duty and discipline and friends and countryâ Wrote home to Rome that he had found a prize, Venus in woman's shapeâon that wild night Forsook his post, when captain of the guard, Reckless for Mary's sakeâmyself assisting Encountered, challenged, slew, his friend Valerius, And, being condemned to death, fell on his sword. Now I shall knowâas I have longed to knowâ What sweet strange pleasure-giving touch she has, That drew the very soul from out the body Of strong Valeriusâthat o'erthrew Liciniusâ That made impassioned Flaccus loathe his wife, Andâturning to our raceârevived in old Withered Ben-Aaron his lost taste for woman. Now shall I know it all. Enter Mary. She speaks to herself, gazing around her). Mary. The very spotâ The very spot where last night they betrayed him! Upon those flowers I even now could deem I see the blood of Malchus. (Coming forward, and addressing Judas). Friend, I'm here. Judas (aside). At lastâno soul is nearâthe garden's lonelyâ Unless the bloodless ghost of Jesus watches! (To Mary) Welcomeâthe night grows sweeter. Mary. Sweeter? Here The stars are shining somewhat over-brightly. Draw back a littleâfollow me, friendâso: I know a love-sweet corner; I'll confessâ You like confessionâthat I metâ Judas. Valerius? Mary. Valerius there in pleasant days gone by. Judas. Lead thou the way. (Aside) In every pulse I tremble! The hot blood courses through my veins like fire. (aloud) Is this the way? Mary. This way. Now stoop a little. Wait, while I lift this branchânow enterâso. 'Tis light outside, but dark beneath the leaves. That matters little, Judas, for our eyes Can flash forth love-light underneath the branches? Judas (stooping to enter the bower). Mary, I love you madly. Mary. And I hate you Deeplier than woman ever hated man! (She draws out a knife and stabs him. He falls, struggling). Take this . . . and this . . . and this. . What, but half dead! Nay, writhe there helplessâglare at me with eyes In which thine holy passion of love is mixed With dread of death, and deadlier dread of hell. Judas. Curse you! . . . the hot blood chokes my utterance back . . . Mary. Dost thou still love me? . . . Lo! I stab thee again With this keen knife dipped in the blood of Jesus. Now let me tell theeâsooner than have given Myself to thee, I would have let Rome's lions Divide me inch by inch; I would have kissed Their ravenous jaws frothy with human blood Far rather than thy lips. Yea, when I kissed thee, Or kissed thee as thou thoughtest, I spat out Thy kiss; the flowers it fell upon are dead. Hear this before thou diest. Hear this tooâ I so loved Jesusâwith so fine an edge Of superhuman and unuttered loveâ That I cared nought at all, nor did he care, For what this lying world calls love and passion. I would have tarried spotless for his sake, Loving the very ground he trod upon, Demanding nought from him for love's return Save only the sweet pure touch of his hands Upon my brow, the blessing of his eyes, The magic of his voiceâI would have tarried Thus for his sake, contented, peaceful, proud, Till the last star within the darkling skies Of this life faded, and the dawn of life Eternal glittered on the mountain-tops. Hear thisâand die. (He dies). Here comes Ben-Aaron. Let me get my breathâ I'll greet him like a lover. Men can do Great deeds, I doubt not, but a woman's deeds When once the woman's desperate make man's deeds Pale into nothingness. (Enter Ben-Aaron). Best greeting, Sir. I here await your orders. (She stands between Ben-Aaron and the corpse of Judas). Let us move A little this way, where the moon shines clear. Ben-Aaron. Queen art thouâradiant empress of the night, Empress of man, being as thou surely art In every sweet pulse woman. By the gods, Not all the virtues of the angel-world Of which that dreamer dreamed had half the sweetness, Mary, of just one little sin of thine! Knowledge is God, I saidânay, love is God; But not the love of which the dead man spoke, But love alive with passion. Mary. Wilt thou kiss me? Nay, tell me firstâthou hast all knowledge, thouâ Are there dark chambers in the vaults of hell Where women who have sinned all mortal sins May do immortal penance? Are there too Mansions illumed by never-setting stars For saints whom sinners worship? Tell me this. Ben-Aaron. Speak not thus strangely! Knowledge was my God, But knowledge I dethroneâyes, for this night. We'll tread together the fair flower-strewn floors Of pleasure's passionate temple. Mary. Turn thy head. Seest thou yon portent in the ghastly moonâ (Ben-Aaron turns. She stabs him). The portent of thy death? Ben-Aaron. Thou lying traitress! I gave thee loveâ Mary. And I have given thee back Thy love,âin woman's fashion. Hound thou art; (Stepping aside, that he may see the body of Judas). Soon shall thy carrion-carcase stink beside That other carrion thereâfit vultures' food, If vultures deign to touch it. Ben-Aaron. Mercyâhelp! Mary. Nay, cry out louderâthere is none to hear Save only God, and him thou dost deny. Think not on deathânay, âdeath's a gloomy word: I never use itânever think on death IndeedâI think of love and maidens' lips, But not of death and darknessââYes, I heard; And now I give you back your pleasant words But gently lest I hurt you, for I know You âshiverâ at âroughâ speech. Ben-Aaron. Before I die With all my soul I curse you, and I curseâ Mary. Curses are holiest blessings when they come From such as you; your blessing is your curse, Your curse your blessing. But enough of this: (She stabs him again. He dies). Join thou thy comrade in the deep foul hell Where such dogs' souls foregather. As for me, (Dragging his body to the side of that of Judas). My work is ended now these two lie slain; Now have I avenged thee, Jesus,âthou didst soften My heartâfor one glad momentâbut thy death Has changed my heart to stone, my hands to steel, And given me force to drive the dagger home. Now must I follow theeâ My life has been a sad life; once I thought, Full of the passion and the pride of youth, That all men loved meâI believed their wordsâ Then came betrayal, insight into baseness, And then revenge; the tempted ruined girl Became the tempter,âwith Delilah's look Now in my eyes I sought the haunts of men, Seduced and overthrew the Roman Samsons. Once half I lovedâTibullusâbut his death, Mad, self-inflicted, left me lone again With black despair before me; then came Jesus: Old thoughts of Galilee and girlish days With him revived,âthe fancy of a girl Changed, deepening, to the absorbing love of woman. The strange divine sweet look within his eyes (Grown sweeter in the long years since we parted) Lured me as nought on earth had lured me yet: I knew he saw God's face, and from God's face His own face won its pure unearthly sweetness. There could be but one Jesus in the world; But one for meâfor all the world but one! Call ye him Son of God, or Son of man, King of my heart, or King of all the Jews, It matters littleâKing he is and Lord In virtue of the ever-enduring might Of kingly gentleness and perfect manhood. All women loved him; woman ever loves The nobleness in man, though man believes She loves the half-tamed passionate brute in him. We loved himâI the most, who most had sinned; I, lifted by him from the lowest depth, Mine heart made whole, my deadliest sins forgiven: We loved himâand unnumbered women more Through all the ages in the far-off lands, Weary of man, shall love the Son of man,â Shall bring their silent sorrows unto him, And in the love of him find peace and rest. So, surely, it shall be. But now I go To join himâhe'll forgive me for the crime, If crime it be to hate myself so much Here left without him, and to love so much The land his spirit dwells in, that I choose By violent death to pass the viewless gates. Forbidden to die for him, I choose to die With him at least; Jesus, receive my soul And let me, ignorant of joy on earth, Find joy triumphant, passing earthly speech, With thee, my Lord and Master, where thou artâ For where thou art, it must be well for me To tarry with thee, gazing as of old Deep in thine eyes wherethrough the love of God Shone verily. Master, I follow thee! (She raises the dagger. Voices are heard in the distance. Mary pauses, listening, the dagger poised in her hand. Soon a party of disciples passes along the back of the stage, carrying the dead body of Jesus to burial, and singing this funeral dirge). [Disciples.] Darkness o'er all the land is spread: The sun again will rise; Will this man issue from the dead, Living, with sunlike eyes? Weeping, his death-cold corpse we bear Through night's deep silent gloom: Within the rock true hands prepare A great King's humble tomb. For Jesus was our King,âhe falls; What hand shall stoop to save? What foot can scale the starry walls? Who can unbar the grave? Darkness o'er all the land is poured And in our souls is night, For conquering Death with darkness' sword Has slain the Lord of light. And we who loved the Lord of light Are left on earth forlorn Within the kingdom of the night: Hope dies, hope barely born. When once again the sun shall rise He'll find the world undone, For Jesus, offspring of the skies, Has passed beyond the sun. (The voices slowly die away in the distance.) Mary. They carry him to burial . . . Ah, to think That such a life can end in such a doom! That death should seize himâhim in whom I saw The very face of God, God visible! Can the cold army of the countless worms Invade the flesh of God, for God through him With the full splendour of his presence shone? Yes: death has conquered lifeâand conquered love; Yetâ. . . (She hastens in the direction taken by the burial party). Scene III. The Sepulchre. (Mary enters hastily). Mary. The stone! But what the unloving arms of man Can do, a woman's loving eager arms Can surely do. (She stoops over the stone, struggling to move it). It movesâanother effortânow aside The rocky barrier rollsâthe moonlight falls Full on the face of Jesus. I'll enter! man fears death, but woman fears Nought save the loss of love; when love is lost, Then life and death to woman's heart are one. (She enters the sepulchre, re-appearing a moment after at the entrance). He lives! (Exit Mary hastily). Scene IV. Room in Mary's house. TimeâSunday morning. Jesus, pale and exhausted, lying on a couch. Mary sitting near him. Jesus. Thou art an angel! In the moon's bright rays Thee seeing I thought that surely now at last My Father's heaven was entered. Mary. Woman's love Can change a hell to heaven, and from the depth Of darkness draw forth light. Jesus. What didst thou do? Mary. Entering the sepulchre where thou wast laid I saw the solemn moonlight on thy face So strangely, sweetly, falling, and I thought, âEven so must shine the brows of saints in heaven.â Then, as I closelier looked, I saw a blade Of quivering grass that in the rockwork grewâ Why did the grass-blade quiver? The night was windless, and that stifling cave Had even in storm been windless, but the grass Moved, moved most gently. Then again I looked, Quite close, with woman's eyesâoh! they are keen When sweet love through them flashesâand I saw The blade of grass was lifted by thy breath. Jesus. Mary, I love thee! Mary (aside). Woman's triumph now; Not man's, but woman's. (Aloud) Let me speak for thee: Thou must be silent,âlungs and throat must rest For there is toil before us.âWhen I saw The grass-blade quiver thus, I knew that hope Was not yet all departed. Then I ran, Conferring not with any soul but only With mine own heartâI brought thee wine and food And strong restoratives, and bathed thy lips And sponged thy wounds, and so by slow degrees While night waxed onward the sweet life returned, Till lastly thine eyes opened and thou sawest Not God, butâMary. Jesus. Tell meâtell me more. Mary. Then with true-hearted Joseph, thy disciple (To him and him alone, whose loving care Had placed thee in his new-wrought rocky tomb, To him alone I dared to tell the truth) âWith his strong aid I brought thee to my home. The Sabbath day was dawning, but the darkness Still wrapped us round with its soft friendly veil:â Here thou wast safe, and through the Sabbath day I tended thee, as woman only knows The art of tendance; then through many a phase Of dim strange doubtful strife thy body passed. But on the Sabbath eveningâyesternightâ I knew that all was well, and that my love Had saved my Lord and Master. Jesus. Tell me more. Thy words are very sweet, and life is sweet, Even as dark death was hideous. Mary. Nay, no more. Much rest is needed. Trust me. All shall be Right well, I promise. Thou hast actedânow Let me the woman act; I'll act for thee, And for the world besides. Take now thy rest; Banish all anxious thoughtsâI'll think for thee. When thou canst travel, thou shalt journey with me Back to our Galilee, far, far away From this fierce city and this rocky land: We'll see once more the blue waves of the lake, And see the sweet bright sunshine, thou and I, And countless hearts shall love thee; this one thing I, Mary, dare to ask thee, now that death Has (surely it has?) been passed by both of us And light immortal gilds the heights beyondâ In life I called thee Master, never dared To think of thee save only as my Lord, But now . . . Wilt thou for love's sake kiss me? Jesus. Stoop thine head. Mary. Now sleep. I love thee, and thy Father loves thee: Woman and God may win, where man has failed. (Jesus sleeps tranquilly). âHe sleeps,ânow all the road to safety shines Before me, clear as if by lightning-flash: Mary the harlot!âyet a harlot's hands May save the whole world's saviour, though the hands Of no pure woman warded off his doom. In hurrying stream swift course along my brain A thousand thoughtsâthe Master must be brought With eagle's haste yet with most snakelike caution From this accursed city to the North: The North is faithful; there are true men there And fewer priestsâwhich means the self-same thing. Once in the North, he's safe: the glad bright sun, The breeze across the lake, the fairy flowers, The sight of mountainsâthis will soon restore Health to the body, vigour to the mind. The future lies before usâthat we leave To Godâit is sufficient that I save God's Son from cruellest death at basest hands. Not all the priests of proud Jerusalem, Not all this wicked city's hosts arrayed Against meâscribes and Pharisees and eldersâ Have matched one woman's wit, one woman's love! But now to action; some few must be told, Fewer the betterâneed one man be told? Men are such babblers; men, with best intent, Will let the secret out,âtheir garrulous tongues Will slay the Lord again: I'll keep the secret For Jesus' sake and for the sake of man. Joseph of ArimathÃ¦aâhe is staunch, But not a single soul besides shall know That Jesus lives; a man once dead is safe From man's pursuit, and risen spirits are safeâ Silence! I see it all. (Exit). Scene V. The road to the Sepulchre. Same morning. (Enter Peter, Thomas, John, Mary the Mother of Jesus, and Mary Cleophas). Peter. Darkness complete and utter shrouds our hopes: The Master's dead,âand with him dies the dream That stirred a thousand hearts; the worst comes true. We are defeated: back to Galilee Our steps must travel. John. We shall see the sun Shine on the lake, the summer flowers will bloom; All will be as of oldâsave only this, The Lord will not be there. Thomas. You see it now? I spoke my warning word,âyou would not heed My warning: that descent the Master made Upon Jerusalem was most untimely. The priests and rulers there with coarse lewd strength Know how to nip young bright thought in the bud: What could we do? Mary Cleophas. You might at least have shown Some fight, some true men's courage. Peter there, Had but his sword been backed by swords of yours, Would nobly have led the way. Mary the Mother. Too late! too late! Mary Cleophas. Too late it is: it had not been too late If in the garden these men had but fought Like men; some men are women after all, Or rather are not women, for no woman Would tamely have stood and seen the Master seizedâ Aye, weaponless, I would have made them feel A woman's anger. John. Peace, and say no more. The Master taught us this, to love each other: Shall we soon forget? Mary the Mother. My well-beloved, Cold in the tomb! Ah, had he only listened To me, to Joseph, all had then been well! To beard the powers that be is never safe: It is not wise nor seemly. Peter. Powers that be? 'Twas liar Ben-Aaron who convicted Jesus. The crook-tongued dotard! One thing's left to do Ere I start Northwardâin his black foul heart To sheathe my sword. John. That was not Jesus' mode. When I besought him to invoke from heaven The wild revenge of flame on those base villages, Remember he rebuked me. Mary the Mother. He was ever Most gentle, was my son. Thomas. He was too gentle. Against the ravening herd of priests and scribes The wiser methodâand more righteous tooâ Is to meet force by force, cunning by cunning. But still the fatal error was to attack With strengthless hands this city where the Law Still holds its own. Peter. The Law will triumph now. Mankind will wait through many a weary year: No prophet sent of God will bid it rise And burst the chains of ages. All is overâ Hope's at an end! Thomas. Hope's sweetness died with him. You'll turn again to fishing? Peter. In hard toil Will be my solaceâsolace of a sort; Though nought can change the sadness of a dream Rudely demolished thus. Mary the Mother. Let's hasten on. Have you the myrrh, the spices? Mary Cleophas. All are here. This one rite ended, we will seek the North, Leaving the Master of our dreams to sleep, Unroused, the dreamless slumber. (Enter Mary Magdalene, coming from the direction of the Sepulchre). Mary Magdalene. Ye are dreaming! Behold, the Master lives. All in Unison. The Master lives? Mary Magdalene. I to the tomb this morn with spices came, Thinking to embalm the dead. What deem ye then I saw? I saw two angels clothed in white Where Jesus' body had lainâI turned away, Stricken with sudden terror. But one said, âMary, be not afraid: thy Lord is risen, And we are sent from God with tidings glad To thee the first of mortals. Jesus now Past starriest heights has risen to God's right hand, And death bewails its death-wound. Could the grave Retain the Son of God? Go, tell thou this To his disciples; tell them that the Lord Will go before them into Galileeâ There shall they see him.â Then the voice became Silent; I looked againâthe forms were gone, Quite empty was the tomb. Thomas. I'll hasten on, Enter the tomb, and if the tomb be emptyâ (Exit Thomas). Peter. The Lord has risen. John. I now recall his words. Mary the Mother. Risen from the dead! Mary Cleophas. We might have guessed as much. (Exeunt Peter, John, Mary the Mother, and Mary Cleophas). Mary Magdalene (coming to the front of the Stage). Safeâand the world will never know the truth!

Mary. Nay, was I ever afraid, Afraid of thee? Thy face I could not fear Though full of power unearthly! Is it thou? Let me draw near, and with these loving handsâ Ah God, the blood-spots on them!âI have sinned. Jesus. Thou hast sinned: thou shouldst have waited for revenge Till God my Fatherâand the Father too Of these poor sinnersâspoke; and whether he spoke In thunder, or by gentler sunnier means Won their lost souls, the ending had been well. Mary. But, Lord, I saw thy body just now borneâ Jesus. The body dies: the deathless spirit survives. Nor mine alone, but thine, the spirits of all; All shall survive, for all alike are safe Within the Father's hand.âNay, touch me not: I am not yet ascended to my Father. Go thou; tell all my followers I am risen. To thee, red-handed, still I give my blessing; I pardon thy great sinâyet sin no more: Man's justiceâas they call itâshall not reach thee. For thee far loftier fate is in reserve: Thou shalt teach women; all thy sex shall learn, Aye learn through strange wild hours of coming years, From thee the laws of purity and love. Thou hast taken life: but many and many a time Have women taken life, and many a time Shall they take life, and men shall take it too, Yet in my Father's eyes, the eyes whose light Transpierces all disguises, every veil, Seem far less guilty often it may be Than those who judge them, for my Father knows The hidden motives, he can weigh them all: He knows that often love itself destroys, And that a woman's mute complete despair Spurs on towards acts of frenzy. For the lives That thou hast taken thou shalt fully atone, For thou shalt save innumerable lives: Yea, thou shalt tend the poor, and nurse the sick, And save thy sisters from far worse than death, The soul's destruction; thou hast been the type Of woman's sin and madness, be thou now Through every age the pattern and the type Of her supreme repentance. Mary. But I long, Lord, to be with thee! I would see thy face, Thine eyes for ever. Jesus. Thou shalt see my face, But in my Father's kingdom. Here on earth I may not longer tarry. Tell the world That thou hast seen me; that there is no death, Save only sin. Farewell. Mary. My Lord and God! (The figure of Jesus vanishes.âMary falls, fainting).

      <field name="fulltext">Having now given the three versions in extenso. I should like to add a few words in support of my allegation (in the Note at the commencement of the volume) that each version is in conformity with the canons of positive science. The second, which may be called the sombre ending, needs no defence as far as natural science is concerned. Jesus simply dies; and is probably thrust hurriedly into the ground on, or near, the spot where he was executed. The third may be called the apparitional ending, and in reference to the bearing of modern science upon this, a few remarks must be made.âThe fact of apparitions as such seems to be scientifically established. But the method of physical procedure âif one may so express oneselfâin these cases, we have, with our present amount of knowledge, no means of accurately ascertaining. I see no reason, however, why we should identify Jesus with the Messiah, etc., even if he ârose from the dead,â when rising from the dead, in the sense of apparitional appearance after death, is, as Messrs. Myers' and Gurney's recent work âPhantasms of the Living.â upon the subject exhaustively proves, so common as to become positively annoying. It is difficult to see how a book like Westcott's âGospel of the Resurrection,â based as its whole argument is upon the assumption that the resurrection of Jesus was an entirely unique and exceptional fact in history, retains the slightest force when it is shownâand this âPhantasms of the Livingâ seems conclusively to showâthat the dead are constantly in the habit of re-appearing; or, to speak more correctly, that apparitional appearance at or near the moment of a death, whatever this may indicate (and as to this point we are as yet completely in the dark), is of almost daily occurrence. In fact, as in nearly all that relates to religion, the old method of thought is being rapidly reversed. The resurrection of Jesus no longer, as was originally held, implies and involves the resurrection of the whole human race. The greater includes the less: it is the resurrection of the whole human raceâuninterruptedly proceeding, by strict physical and psychical law, it may beâwhich involves and implies that of Jesus. We now come to the ending given in the text; which may be called the resuscitational ending. As I have already remarked, I selected this for the body of the work, principally for dramatic and poetical reasons. It enables an author to develop in fuller detail the character of Mary; and, if the play should some day be acted, it would give special scope and opportunity to an actress of genius. Apart from this, however, it is by no means impossible that the resuscitational ending may, after all, be the nearest to historic fact. There have always been thinkers and critics who have believed that Jesus did not actually die upon the cross; that, during the unusually short time that he remained there, his body merely underwent a temporary suspension of animation; that he was taken down and restored to life in some such way as that suggested in the text of my play; and that from subsequent occasional appearances of the actual living Jesus the legend of the resurrection arose. The following passage (the italics in which are my own) from William Rathbone Greg's âCreed of Christendom,â has great interest, as bearing upon this point:ââThree different suppositions may be adopted, each of which has found favour in the eyes of some writers. We may either imagine that Jesus was not really and entirely dead when taken down from the cross, a supposition which Paulus and others show to be far from destitute of probability (Strauss, iii. 288): or we may imagine that the apparition of Jesus to his disciples belongs to that class of appearances of departed spirits for which so much staggering and bewildering evidence is on record (see Bush's Anastasis, 156); or, lastly, we may believe that the minds of the disciples, excited by the disappearance of the body, and the announcement by the women of his resurrection, mistook some passing individual for their crucified Lord, and that from such an origin multiplied rumours of his re-appearance arose and spread. We do not, ourselves, definitively adopt any of these hypotheses: we wish simply to call attention to the circumstance that we have no clear, consistent, credible account of the resurrection; that the only elements of the narrative which are retained and remain uniform in all its forms,âviz., the disappearance of the body, and the appearance of some one in white at the tomb, are simple and probable, and in no way necessitate, or clearly point to, the surmise of a bodily resurrection at all.ââ Greg's âCreed of Christendomâ (1883), Vol. II., pp. 153, 154. It is worth while to add that, on a careful study and comparison of the eleven accounts of post-mortem appearances of Jesus given in the Gospels, the reader cannot fail to be struck by their curious vagueness, and by the fact that many of them harmonise almost equally well either with the apparitional or with the resuscitational theory of the resurrection. NOTE B. Modern ideas, when combined with great general ignorance of the original facts of the story, cause singular confusion and give rise to the most startling anachronisms. A case in point occurs to my mind at this moment,âthat of an old picture in the possession of our family, in which Jesus sits at supper with two of his disciples. The blue Galilean mountainsâor possibly the peaks around Jerusalemâappear in the distance, seen through an open window: a Cornish smuggler with a red night-cap leans upon the table, conversing with one of the disciples; a youth, in the attire of the squire of a mediÃ¦val knight, stands in the background; while under the sleeves of Jesus' robe the starched linen cuffs of modern times are apparent. NOTE C. âJosephus âAntiq. viii. 2, 5.â tells of a Jewish exorcist, who by means of a magic ring and Solomonian talismans, drew devils out of the nose of persons possessed by them; that in order to convince the bystanders that the evil spirit had really gone out, he placed close by a bucket full of water, and ordered the devil to upset it, which the latter really did; and Josephus assures us that he himself had been a joint spectator of this proof of the incomparable wisdom of his countryman, Solomon.ââ Strauss' âNew Life of Jesus,â authorised translation, 1865. Vol. II., p. 185. NOTE D. âPhilostratus âVita Apollon. iv. 20.â tells how Apollonius of Tyana ordered a devil who had possessed a youth to depart with a visible sign, upon which the devil entreated to be allowed to upset a statue that stood near, and this statue did really fall over just at the moment when the devil left the young man.ââ Strauss' âNew Life of Jesus,â authorised translation, 1865. Vol. II., p. 186. NOTE E. âThe superior quality of the wine, and the enormous quantity produced (135 gallons, or in our language, above forty-three dozen âSee the calculation in Hennell, and in Strauss, ii. 432. The ???????? is supposed to correspond to the Hebrew bath, which was equal to 1Â½ Roman amphora, or 87 gallons; the whole quantity would therefore be from 104 to 156 gallons.â) are obviously fabulous.ââ Greg's âCreed of Christendomâ (1883), Vol. II., pp. 55, 56. NOTE F. âOf the fishes in the Sea of Galilee, the Chromidae were clean and allowed for food. These are the most abundant and characteristic fishes in the lake. They are allied to the wrasses. There are eight species now known from these waters, and some of these, notably C. Tiberiadis, are amazingly abundant. The fresh-water fishes of Egypt belong chiefly to the bream (Sparidae), perch (Percidae), and carp (Cyprinidae) tribes, as well as Chromidae.ââ Hart's âAnimals of the Bibleâ (1888), pp. 94, 95. In âHelps to the Study of the Bible,â printed at the Oxford University Press, carp and perch are mentioned (on page 316) as found in Lake Gennesaret, but the authority for this is not given. NOTE G. âLuke only speaks of a great multitude of fishes, but the author of John xxi. gives their number definitely at 153. In reference to this number, there is a remarkable observation of the learned father of the Church, Hieronymus. âThe writers,â he observes, âComment upon Ezekiel, 47.â âupon the nature and characteristics of animals, and among them the excellent Cilician poet Oppian, say, that there are 153 species of fishes; all these were caught by the Apostles, and none were uncaught, just as great and small, rich and poor, all sorts of men were drawn to happiness out of the sea of this world.â Hieronymus, therefore, considers the number 153 as that of all species of fishes adopted by the writers on natural history of that time, especially by Oppian. And in the fact that exactly this number of fishes were caught by the Apostles at that time, he sees a prophetic symbol of men of all kinds being incorporated by the preaching of the Apostles into the kingdom of God. Now, as regards Oppian in his Poem upon fishing, written, however, according to the most probable supposition, in the last year of Marcus Aurelius, and therefore later than the fourth Gospel, we do not find any exact number of the species of fish given, and if we count their numbers, we may, according as we take in or not the sub-divisions into which many of the same species may be distributed, and count similar names twice or not, possibly make out 153, but also quite as easily more or less. Hieronymus, however, only refers to Oppian among others, and therefore there is still a probability that in some writer on natural history, now lost, that number may have been more definitely given.ââ Strauss' âNew Life of Jesus,â authorised translation, 1865. Vol. II., pp. 132, 133. NOTE H. Had Jesus lived to reach mature years (which, fortunately for the race, he did notâas we now have the young, and therefore hopeful, Jesus) we should probably have seen the same change at work which is generally so evident in the later periods of the lives of great thinkers; the change from an optimistic to a more pessimistic view of things. In fact, in a measure, we do see it: that is to say, we see the marked change between the Jesus of Galilee and the Jesus of Jerusalem. During that last memorable visit to Jerusalem, the friction with the official red-tape world of the period was producing irritation in his mind and consequent violence in his utterance: and it is quite possible that, had he lived many years longer, his view of life would have changedâand the whole world's history would then have been different. In a deeper than the orthodox sense it was his deathâhis early deathâwhich secured his apparent victory. NOTE I. Jesus. Thou couldest have no power at all against me Were not that power first given thee from above; He therefore that delivered thee to me Is the chief culprit, hath the greater sin. Act IV., Scene VIII. I have thought it best to leave this passage in its original semi-obscurity, as given in John's Gospel. Numberless attempts have been made to throw light upon its meaning, but none of them seems to me quite satisfactory. Probably we have not a perfectly correct report of the actual words used by Jesus upon this occasion. âSome have thought that the word ??????, from above, refers to the situation of the temple, which stood much higher than the PrÃ¦torium; and that it is as if Jesus had said, âI know that whatever thou dost against me, is only in consequence of the sentence passed in yonder court held above; so that their guilt is greater than thine.â But though this would very well account for the connexion of the latter part of the verse, I cannot think it altogether just; for had Providence permitted Pilate to seize Christ as one dangerous to CÃ¦sar's dignity, he would have had as much power of putting him to death as he now had. It is therefore much more reasonable to suppose it refers to the permission of God's providence. No thought was more proper to the occasion; and I think the interpretation I have given to the latter clause, in this view, is natural, though not very common. But if any are not satisfied with it, they may consider whether ??? ????? may not be connected with the beginning of the verse, so that it might be translated, Thou couldst have no power at all against me, unless it were given thee from above for this purpose.â âDoddridge.</field>
