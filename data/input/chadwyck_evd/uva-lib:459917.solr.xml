      <field name="fulltext">LOVE IN A RIDDLE. A PASTORAL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. WILKS. Our Author, of his Rural Muse afraid, Calls in, To-night, plain Sonnet to his Aid. His Scheme, I told him, might some Judgment shew, Could he have call'd in Skilful Voices too. To that he answer'dâLet your Sounds have Sense, Old England will with English Throats dispense, And take what's well design'd, for Excellence. 'Tis not our Nice Performance is the Thing; Good Songs will always Candid Hearers bring; Providedâwe find Airs, which they Themselves may sing. An English Song, ill sung, will please Good-nature: You've some Delight, to know you sing it better. If Songs are harmless Revels of the Heart, Why should our Native Tongue not bear its Part? Why after learned Warblers must we pant, And doat on Airs, which only They can chaunt? Methinks 'twere hard, if, in the cheerful Spring, Were none but Nightingales allow'd to sing! The Lark, the Sparrow, and the plain Cuckooe, Have all an Equal Right, to Chirp, and Wooe: Ev'n France in That her Liberty maintains; Her Songs, at least, are free from Foreign Chains, And Peers and Peasants sing their Native Strains. Time was, even Here, when D'Urfey vamp'd a Song, The same the Courtier and the Cobler sung. What tho' our Connoisseurs may love Champagne; Must never English Ale go down again? Must no Mouths drink, but what at Taverns dine? All Pockets reach not Honest Jephson's Wine. Since then, of late, you've given our Hopes some Ground, Since plain October has your Favour found, Why Troth! ev'n mend your Draught, and let old Songs go round.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. ARCAS alone. Arcas. Hail! to the rising Day! Hail! waking Nature! Ye verdant Plains, ye Hills, and fertile Valleys, Ye lowing Herds, and fleecy bleating Flocks, Ye warbling Groves, and murmuring Fountains, Hail! Once yet again I see the annual Morn That gave me Birth, and counts me into Age. O! PhÅbus hear! God of refulgent Skies! [Kneels. All-glorious Ruler of revolving Light, Author of Medicine, and Immortal Song, Deign to receive these Thanks of Adoration! Thanks for thy Course of rolling Years enjoy'd, That thus have, unafflicted, born me through The various Periods of appointed Life! The Spring of Infancy, Summer of Youth, The reaping Autumn of experienc'd Man, Down for the Winter of unaching Age. Thanks to the Comforts of a genial Bed, Now ripening to the Joys of Love, and Virtue. Such are the Blessings from thy Beams receiv'd, And these, O PhÅbus! are the Thanks we pay thee. Ãgon singing within. Hark! from the Vale, I hear the Jovial Voice Of Ãgon, blyth, and lusty, as the Summer, Nor bending to the Burthen of his Years; Joeund he comes, and chaunting to the Day, With friendly GratulationâÃgon, Hail! Enter Ãgon. Health, and the Blessings of the Morn, be thine. Ãg. Why ay, my Lord! this Day is blest indeed! It gave you Life, and me the best of the Friends; And to that Friend I owe my jovial Heart. AIR I. Ye Nymphs, and Swains, With Melody hail the Day; Make Holyday round the Plains, All jollily dance and play. This happy, glorious Sun Gave to your Fields a Lord, Of all your Hopes the Crown, And, to your Folds, the Guard. Let the Man to all so dear With rural Pan be sung: To the next, and next good Year, Here may he live Blest, and Long. Arc. Thanks to thy Love: thy jolly Voice, tho'rough As is the Billow curling to the Beach, Revives the Images of Pleasure past, When Mirth and Revels were excus'd by Youth. Ãg. Excus'd by Youth, my Lord! You make me smile: Is there a stated Time, in this short Life, That makes it Wisdom to be sad, Or Weakness to be happy! No: Let Policy, or Guile, disguise their Face! But Honesty dares hold it to the Sun! May we have a Cause for Gladness, and not shew it? Was't not this happy Day that gave you Birth? Are you not Lord of these Arcadian Plains? Where, like the Substitute of Heav'nly Power, You dole the Blessings you from thence receive, And make a People, by your Bounty, happy. Yet not more blest by Bounty, than Example: Your Life has taught those Virtues, you reward. And is not this a Cause for general Joy? Are you not still the same belov'd Lord Arcas? Are you not still that honest Nobleman? Arc. Suppose me soâ Ãg. âWhy then, my Lord, let those Be sad, who never wore but half that Title! Let our Corinthian Lords be Grave, and Graceless: The Privilege of Honesty is Mirth! Arc. Yet Charity becomes the Cheerful too. Ãg. Mine, Sir, begins, where their Court-Friendship ends, At home: Therefore I say we're happier Men, Yet only Happy, as we're better too: Shall Virtue then not taste her Benefits? Shall only Knaves and spendthrift Heirs be jovial? The Cheerfulness of Knaves is Impudence! Have Courts a Joy, like sound Integrity? When they shew that, I'll own'em wise; till when, Let us be plainly pleas'd with Happiness. Arc. O Ãgon! were I capable of Envy, Thy turn of Mind would tempt me to repine! Why have not I this cheerful Taste of Life? Why seems my Plenty less than thy small Store? What are my Wants? where are my Wishes bounded? And yetâ 'Twere happier to be Ãgon, than be Arcas. Ãg. You make me triumph o'er your Learning! You, who have all Philosophy can wish, Have made a Man much happier than your self, By giving him a Tythe of your Possessions. Arc. Wouldst thou have more? Ãg. âMore than enough, Sir? No. To crave, is Poverty; Contentment, Riches: Your Tythe's almost too much for me. Arc. Thus Riches, when not wanted, lose their Name. Ãg. And, when possess'd by Prodigals, their Power. Even so it is, not Wealth, nor Wisdom, Sir, 'Tis Constitution gives us Happiness: Nature has made You Pensive, and Me Sanguine: You think your Virtues are a wise Man's Duty, And therefore wear them, with a serious Brow; Now, Sir, the Few, that I can boast, I think Are Blessings too, therefore as such, enjoy them. AIR II. He that wears a Heart Void of Art, Has Joys unknown To the greatest Men; Who, Nine in Ten, Beneath their Greateness groan. Riches are fine things, That have Wings, And will away: But an honest Mind Will ever find Content will with it stay. He, whose open Soul is clear From Fraud, Disguise, or Guile, May all the Frowns of Fortune bear, And at her Malice smile. Greatness, that would make us Grave, Is but an empty thing: What more than Mirth would Mortals have? The merry Man's a King. But he that, by Deceit, Dares to be meanly great, Will find, in his counting up, What did mount him up, Will make him many Foes, Greater far than he knows, Whom nought will gratify, No Words will satisfy, 'Till he low lies again, Never to rise again: Who then will envy his Fate? But he that by Deceit, &amp;c. What! not a Note, not answer to my Ditty? Arc. Excuse me, if I taste not now thy Muse, Nor joyn thy Carrolls, with my usual Glee. Ãg. Nay then, my Lord, there's something loads your Mind: You wrong my Friendship, if you hide your Griefs. Give me my share! Out with the worst at once Arc. Griefs I have none, but I confess have Fears, And Doubts, that fill me with Anxiety. Have we not each our Children's Happiness In care? The Crisis of their Fate is now. Ãg. And why, Sir, should you doubt their Happiness? Have not our Precepts grounded them in Virtue? Has not indulgent Nature given them Beauty? And our Arcadian Manners Innocence? Have they not been, from Infancy, Companions? Their Lessons, Labours, and their Sports the same? Have I not watch'd them, with a jealous Eye? Yet never found a Warning, to suspect them. At length, their blooming Friendship pays its Promise, Obeys the Season, and matures to Love. Whence then this anxious Doubt of their Misdoing? Arc. Perhaps, dear Ãgon, I'm too diffident: For though we've chang'd our Children, to prevent In mine the conscious Pride of Birth; in thine, To aid, with Birth, the Sentiments of Virtue: Yet Nature still may be mis-led by Fortune: Thus mine, believing Ãgon is their Sire, With views of Interest may dissemble Love, Which unsuspicious Innocence may hear; So thine, supposing Arcas is their Father, In scorn, to mingle with inferior Blood, May slight those Virtues, which deserve their Love. Ãg. These Apprehensions might in Courts be just: But here, where Love, without Ambition, reigns, 'Tis not high Birth, or Lands, or number'd Flocks; But wealth of Virtue in the fair and young, That gives the Nymph her Charms, the Swain his Merit. AIR III. Let Wealth and Power enslave the Great, Where Hearts are barter'd for a Name. Here Love alone can Love create; And Truth supplies the lasting Flame. Arc. Still, I'm inclin'd to have their Virtue prov'd: True Love is better known, by Grief, than Joy, As Hope is often measur'd by our Fear. Therefore (but not without my Friend advising) I have some thoughts of offering thy Pastora The noble Philemon's Heir, the gay Philautus, Polisht in Courts, and skill'd in Vanities; If then her Heart can stoop to such a Lureâ Ãg. I take your Meaning; and as just approve it: If, when you offer to her Arms Philautus, She shews a Fear, that you may force her Will, That Fear will force her Love to own Amyntas: If she admit Philautus, Amyntas, then, Will well escape a Maid, below his Love, And the proud Girl with her own Choice be punisht: Then, let her hence, to blaze in Courts: Vain Wives And shallow Husbands are no Monsters there. Arc. Yet hope a better Consequence: The Maid Wants no Attraction, that commends her Sex. Nor do I name Philautus, that I doubt her; But that her Virtue may have Lustre from her Choice, And, to Philautus, poor Amyntas be preferr'd. Ãg. My Life, then, answer, that her Choice contents you: The gaudy, tinsel Merit of Philautus Will have a tarnisht Hue, to your Amyntas' Virtue. AIR IV. Our Nymphs on the Plains Among Swains Have their Joys, that no Courts ever gave: Where the married in Chains, And long Trains, Carry Sorrow, in Pomp, to their Grave. Arc. Thy Confidence, my Friend, has quell'd my Fears. Be then, for Amyntas' sake, Pastora prov'd: But we have still our younger-born unfixt: How stand we there in Hope?â Ãg. If I guess right, A tender Passion too is kindling there: Ianthe seems of late reserv'd to Iphis: The Youth more pensive, and the Nymph more gay: The usual Consequence of Love declar'd, And Love with Maiden Modesty approv'd. She flies, 'tis true, but flies to be pursued; And urges the Pursuit, to sound his Love. Arc. Let him pursue: I would not wish the Maid Should, on his Summons, yield to Iphis' Birth. Ãg. But see, Amyntas comes; from him perhaps More may be gather'd to assist our Measures. Amyntas ho! whither so fast, my Son? To them Amyntas. Am. Pastora tells me, Sir, a favourite Lamb Is missing from her Flock. At her Request I to the neighbouring Folds am hying.â Ãg. âStay; I have a while, my Son, to talk with thee. [Apart ...] You see, my Lord, even Maids in Love are Woers. Pastora would, but cannot, hide her Flame. How amorously Coy! This Hint betrays it. A Lamb is stray'dâwhy His the Charge to find it? Her Heart, she means; her Breast, the Fold that lost it! Yet he, Fond Youth, in honest Fear mistakes her.[... Apart] Arc. The modest Lover recommends his Flame: But to our other pointâ Ãg. Come near, Amyntas. Am. Health, and the Rays of many a smiling Morn, Like this, prolong the Days of Arcas. Arc. Amyntas, I am Debtor to thy Love. Ãg. I have observ'd of late, Lord Arcas Son, Young Iphis, holds thee near his Heart, Amyntas: Of course, his Joys and Cares are known to thee. Now then, be just, my Boy; answer directly; Has he yet ever told thee, that he lov'd? Am. Neverâhe never told me, that he lov'd. Ãg. Amyntas, thou repeat'st my Words, as thou Wouldst hold me to their litteral Sense: take heed! Evade not what I meanâ Am. I take your Meaning: My Father knows, what's fit his Son should answer. Ãg. Know'st thou then ought unfitting me to ask? Am. Your Question then, Sir, would require no Answer. Ãg. How! so blunt! Am I not thy Father, Boy? Am. Such, Sir, my daily Prayers to Heaven, confess you. Nor shall my Father sigh, that I'm his Son. Arc. No, generous Youth, thy Father sighsâto own thee. [Aside. Ãg. Whence are these half Replies? be full, I say, And tell me what thou know'st of Iphis' Love. Am. The Precepts you have taught me reach no farther. Pardon my Doubts; for I am yet to learn, That Duty can dispense with broken Friendship. 'Till he declares he loves; am I to accuse him? Ãg. Darest thou not make thy Father Judge of what May wrong thy Friend?â Am. I dare: I've told my Fears: If they're unjust, condemn; if not, forgive them. Arc. The faithful Boy! Ãgon, I must embrace him! Believe me, Youth, thy dearest Father's Arms Ne'er held thee to his Heart with fonder Joy. Excuse him, Friendâ Ãg. What you applaud, my Lord, Needs not Excuseâ Arc. âO Ãgon! Friend indeed! How shall I thank thy Care for such a Son.â [Apart. Thy Fear, Amyntas, to unfold thy Friend, Commends thy Truth, and merits his Esteem. However, to preserve thy Faith unblemish'd, I give thee, with my Hand, my Word, whate'er Thy Candour shall inform me of his Love, My Boy shall never think a Wrong to him, Nor find, from me, Occasion to reproach thee. Am. This, Sir, unties my Tongue: my inmost Thoughts, Like a fair Volume open to your reading. Arc. Thou saidst he never told thee, that he lov'd? Am. Neverâ Arc. Yet thou believest his Grief is Love? Am. Alas, my Lord, a Youth so happy in His Sire, so fam'd for Virtue, Birth, and Feature, What strange Misfortune can disturb, but Love? Arc. Speak without Fear! Love is a venial Frailty. Am. 'Tis true, when kindled by an Object worthy; But Nature calls not Wisdom to her Council, And sometimes chuses with a Youthful Eye. Ãg. Be brief, and name the Nymph, that has engag'd him. Am. Let me now wrong him, Sir; I may mistake Her Name, which yet I have declin'd to know. Ãg. What were thy Reasons to avoid that Secret? Am. Because I fear'd, if known, my Duty might Compell me, at the risque of his Esteem, To inform a tender Father of his Weakness. Arc. Thou then hast Cause to think his Passion blameful? Am. What shall I say? For you, my Lord, are twice My Sire, a Father to my Sire, and me! Nay more, you honour him with Friendship! I too have a Friend, and would deserve him! O whom shall I oblige! whom dare t'offend? Arc. Neither, Amyntas; both shall be oblig'd. Am. Pardon my Doubts; but since your Word supports me, Take my Suspicions, as my Eye have caught them. Arc. Give me the Nymph, whom thou suspect'st he loves. Am. Since I must speakâIanthe, Sir, my Sister, With undesigning Charms, I fear, has seiz'd His youthful Heart; yet shuns the glorious Prize. Arc. 'Tis well, AmyntasâI am still in Temper: And since my Word has wrought thee to this Trust, Darest thou yet make me farther Creditor, And, by a more implicit Faith, oblige me? Am. A Confidence in you, is scarce a Merit; Favours when ask'd, by Virtue, are conferr'd. Arc. Thus then, Amyntasâwhen thou find'st my Son, In friendly Converse, would disclose his Love; Incline to hear him, and condole his Sorrows: But when he names Ianthe, as their Cause, Turn to Amazement, and reprove his Weakness! Dislike, object, discourage, blast his Hope! Urge my Displeasure, and Ianthe's Scorn! Recount Examples of clandestine Love, Whose joyless Hours have groan'd in live-long Woe. Set all the Terrors of Distress before him, And leave the Guidance of his Fate to me. Am. My Lord, you have bound me to a mournful Task: But since I know your Nature just, and gentle, I will believe you act like Heav'nly Power, That strews our way to Happiness, with Thorns: Some woundrous Secret, sure, unripe for Birth, Tho' for a Season wrapt in low'ring Clouds, Must break at last, and spread a golden Day. Arc. Time suits not now, to give thee more, Amyntas: Let it suffice that Iphis is my Hope. Mean-while, we leave thee to thy Charge in hand. Be faithful to thy Trust, and serve thy Friend. [Ex. Arc. and Ãgon. Am. Ambiguous still! Yet where remains the Doubt, When Arcas has declar'd I serve my Friend? But where's the Friend can help forlorn Amyntas? If Iphis, sprung from noble Blood, despairs Of his Ianthe, born so far below him; What then, Amyntas, is thy wretched Portion? How must Pastora, should she know thy Love, Redouble all her Scorn for thee, and on A Brother's Heart revenge a Brother's Pain? Yet why (since Love was never deem'd a Crime) Should Virtue sink abandon'd in Despair? AIR V. Love's a Tempest, Life the Ocean, Passions crost the Deep deform; Rude and raging tho' the Motion, Virtue fearless braves the Storm: Storms and Tempests may blow over, And subside to gentle Gales; So the poor despairing Lover, When least hoping, oft prevails. Love's a Tempest, &amp;c. But see! sad Iphis comes! with heaving Heart, And pensive Pace, he silent stalks along, Lifting, with dewy Eyes, his Sighs to Heav'n! Within this Shade, unseen, I may attend His Mood, and farther know to serve him. [Am. retires. Enter Iphis. Iph. Why, why, fond Wretch, didst thou avow thy Flame? Was not her Friendship more than Love could merit? To every Wish, that Innocence could form, Alternate Kindness, flowing from the Heart, Fill'd up the Measure of our social Hours. When to some distant Hill the Sports have call'd The smiling Fair, unknowing of her Charms, Thought it no Boom, to trust thee with their Treasures. But now, O fatal Avarice of Love! To what Reverse of Fortune art thou fallen! Now, at thy Sight, thy cold Companion flies; Or heedless passing, with a downcast Eye, Contracts her Beauty from thy pining Sense, Offended at their Power to wound, or cure. O Iphis! now farewel thy Joys! farewel thy Peace! Here, to the Musick of this gurgling Brook, Join thy faint Voice, and tell the Woods thy Woe. The flitting Winds perhaps may catch the Sounds, And waft them to Ianthe's Ear. AIR VI. While my Love was a Secret, no Swain Was so blest, or so favour'd, as I; No Pastime delighted the Plain, But Ianthe, with Iphis would hye: When I wrestled, or strain'd for the Race, Her Bosom heav'd Wishes for me; When I won it, she blusht with such Grace, And cry'dâO! the Garland's for Thee. But alas! since my Flame I reveal'd, All her Kindness is turn'd to Disdain; If she Eyes me, she flies o'er the Field, Or bids the Winds hear me complain When the Nymphs, to my Sorrows more kind, Reproach the hard Heart of the Maid; From be Anger this Answer they find, âFond Loveâhas my Friendship betray'd. Amyntas returns. Am. I have attended, Iphis, to thy Sorrows, And now, no longer can suppress the Friend: Give me thy Griefs at large, and ease thy Heart. Iph. Amyntas! have I still a Friend, in thee? A Friend, with whom I may repose my Grief? A Friend, that will with Candour hear, And chide me with Compassion?â Am. âYes, a Friend, That comes prepar'd, determin'd to assist thee. Name, then, the Nymph, that thus has robb'd thee of Thy selfâ Iph. âNeed I repeat what every Grove Has heard, what almost every Tree records? Rip up my Heart, and read Ianthe there! Am. My Sister! is it possible! Ianthe! Iph. She, she, Amyntas, has resolv'd my Ruin. Am. Let me suppress my Wonder, till I hear Thy Tale: unfold, from first to last, the Spring, The Progress, and the Issue of thy Hopes. Iph. Hear, and lament my FateâI will not dwell, Amyntas, with a Lover's Fondness, on Ianthe's Charms, tho' on that one Theme O I could talk whole Midnight Moons to waining. Am. Proceed: my Patience shall indulge thy Fondness. Iph. Ere yet I was susceptible of Love, Or that her Charms unblown could fear the Lover, A sympathetick Friendship join'd our Hearts, Our Innocence inseparable pass'd our Days: Nature, at length, with soft Maturity Spread o'er my youthful Cheek the Manly Down: Then, with unusual Pulses beat my Heart; New Wishes found new Lustre in her Charms, And, on my gazing, Sighs uncall'd would rise: And yet, alas! so innocent my Thoughts, I knew not, then, 'twas Love; nor till this Hour Perhaps had known, but that a fatal Proof (Tho' at the Time transporting) since confirm'd it. Am. Transporting! Ha! let me conceive thee, Iphis. Iph. Mistake me not; the Proof, tho' sweet, was harmless. Am. Forgive my Fear, I ought t'have thought it so. Pursue thy Taleâ Iph. âIt happen'd, on a Day, Pastora, fair Ianthe, and myself Their Guide, returning wearied from the Chace, Accepted, from a neighbouring Swain, Refreshment. There as within the Honey-suckle Bower We lay, whose waving Sweets enrich'd the Air; A careful Bee, providing for the Hive With busy Toil, from Flower to Flower, flew round us. Pastora fearful of his Flight, with Blows Mis-spent in Air, disturb'd his Diligence: The Insect thus provok'd, with sudden Rage, Darts on her Cheek his sharp invenom'd Sting. The shrieking Maid, in Tears, deplor'd her Pain; When kind Ianthe to her Succour flew, And to the fiery Wound her balmy Lips Apply'd; Then solemn to the Ear, she sung Verses of holy and mysterious Meaning, (A Charm bequeath'd her by the Sage Eudocia:) On this the angry Tumour was dispell'd, And to her Cheek the usual Rose return'd. Am. Happy Relief! have magick Notes such Power? But O methinks I feel Pastora's Pain! Iph. Who would not bear not the Pain, to taste the Cure? No, Amyntas, I rather must believe The Charm receiv'd its Virtue from Ianthe: For, sure! such Lips whate'er they touch must heal. Am. But, Iphis, how couldst thou perceive, from thence, That Love had seized thy Heart?â Iph. âAttend the Sequel. While I stood Witness of the charming Cure, I saw such humid Fervour on her Lips, Such willing Fondness sparkling from her Eyes, Heard the sweet chirping Sound of every Kiss, With such DelightâI wish'd the Wound my own. At length so painful grew my tender Longing, That, on a sudden bursting from the Bower, In seeming Anguish covering with my Hand My Face, I writh'd like one in mortal Pain: The Cause inquir'd, I to Ianthe cry'd, Another Bee had pierc'd my raging Lip. She, unsuspicious of her Skill betray'd, Her Innocence unblushing at her Art, With sweet Convulsion drew my healthy Lip To hers, unknowing of the Joys I stole; No Malady she found, but what she gave, A thousand Stings she shot into my Heart, Which since confess'd, her Scorn denies to cure. Am. What on the Instant follow'd this Proceeding? Iph. As to our Home we onward took the way, I fondly smiling own'd the happy Fraud, Exulted on the Joy her Lips had given, And, to excuse the Fact, impeach'd my Love! At this, a red Confusion flush'd her Cheek; Quick Anger darted from her flashing Eyes, Till mute Concern distill'd a falling Tear. Nor Prayers, Excuse, or Penitence prevail'd; For, from that Moment, never would she speak, Regard, converse, or, unavoided, bear My Presence more. AIR VII. I once believ'd, ere she cou'd hate, Kind Nature wou'd her Laws undo, That Doves wou'd with the Falcons mate, Or Falcons to the Doves be true. But, to my Ruin, now I see, The softest Heart is hard to me. Am. âNor can I blame her, Iphis; With Grief, I own thy Story has deceiv'd me; Were these thy tender Motives for my Pity? Fond Youth, thy wanton Fraud was too licentious; What less, than Scorn, could Maiden Shame return, For injur'd Truth, and Innocence betray'd? Iph. O! Amyntas! then I am lost indeed! Reprov'd by thee too, I myself condemn; To merit her Disdain is Misery Compleatâ Am. âNay then I still must pity thee! Thy Resignation yet recalls the Friend, And sooths the jealous Brother to forgive. Iph. O then confirm it by the dearest Proof, And soften, to my Sighs, Ianthe's Heart. Am. No, Iphis; to confirm the Friend sincere, Against thy Love I must support thy Virtue: Thy Duty, Honour, Interest, and thy Fame, With Force invincible, oppose thy Hopes: Therefore, in time, fond Youth, restrain thy Passion. Fix on some Beauty equal to thy Birth, Preserve the Fountain of thy Blood unstain'd, And leave Ianthe to inferior Hearts. Iph. Thy Words, Amyntas, like a Ponyard pierce me. Am. Thy present Pain secures thy future Peace. Iph. Can I have Peace, without Ianthe's Love? Am. Canst thou be happy with diminish'd Honour? Iph. Where Virtue is, the proudest Birth may bow. Am. Take heed, rash Youth! thou hast an high-born Sister: How, in her Heart, wou'dst thou approve these Precepts? Iph. As thou wou'dstâif her Lover would applaud 'em. Am. As I wou'd! I mistake thee sure; explain. Iph. Suppose Amyntas for Pastora burn'd, Suppose Pastora shou'd approve his Flame; Then ask of Love, what wou'd Amyntas do? Am. Admit me frailâwere that a Plea for Iphis? He probes me to the Heart! sure he suspects not. [Aside ...] I must avoid the Subject, and retire. [... Aside.] Iphis, howe'er my Friendship is inclin'd, Compassion must not cancel Obligations: Thy noble Father is our House's Patron: To serve thy Love, were to invade his Honour! Therefore be early warn'd, and rein thy Passion, Return to Duty, and abjure Ianthe. AIR VIII. Fly, when she charms thee: Virtue alarms thee: Oppose her Beauty, With Fame and Duty: Love without Honour's the Bane of our Joys: When Beauty's blasted, Love is soon wasted; Honour's a Blessing Out-lives possessing; The Laurel of Fame no Thunder destroys. Fly, when &amp;c. [Ex. Amyn. Iph. Persuade the Seas in Tempests to be calm! Forbid the vernal Flowers to blowâtheir Sweets To smell, or Seasons to regard the Sun! Such is the Power of Iphis, to recede: To change, is the Relief of luke-warm Lovers; None can be happy, but who dare be wretched! Fortune may starve, but never change my Love. AIR IX. and X. No, no, my Heart! Indure the Smart; Whatever Pain Her Eyes ordain, My never-changing Love shall bear. From Charms so sweet There's no Retreat; So just her Scorn, I still must burn, Tho' doom'd to sure Despair. What tho' her colder Eyes may grieve me. This Consolation still I find, That, from my Sorrows, to relieve me, Kinder Fancy forms her kind. There, disarm'd of coy Disdain; Her yielding Sighs reward my Pain. Amyntas returns. Am. Iphis, dispel thy Fears; Amyntas is With Joy return'd, to gratulate thy Love, Iph. What means my Friend? Enter Arcas. Am. âLord Arcas will inform thee. Iph. My Father! Prostrate let me thus revere him. Arc. Arise, my Son! recover so thy Heart, And prosecute thy Love: Thy Friend Amyntas, By my Appointment, tempting thy Desires, With such fair Praises has adorn'd thy Truth, That my fond Nature earns to indulge thy Vows, And, far as my paternal Sanction may, With Honour, in Ianthe to compleat them. Iph. O kind Amyntas! Didst thou thus deceive me? Arc. I know the Treasures of her Mind, as thou Her Charms; I know that Happiness, in Love, Is not the Gift of Fortune, or of Birth. I know that Honour is adorn'd by Virtue, That Title is, without it, but a Name: Therefore when Virtue prompts thy Heart to loveâ For worldly Views, I give them, to the Air! Iph. How shall my future Life deserve this Goodness! O Amyntas! I breathe again! and my Discordant Heart resumes its Harmony! AIR XI. Away, away, Despair! Leave me, Fear, Pining Care! Of Hope a dawning Light, Kindly bright, Dispels my former Woes: Life is now soft Repose; When Fears to Love Relief deny, By One subdu'd, a Thousand fly: When Hope is once in Sight, All, all the rest is all Delight! Arc. To give thee, Iphis, yet a farther Hope; Ãgon, her Father, knowing my Consent Had ratify'd thy Love, with Joy receiv'd The News, and warn'd Ianthe of her Conquest. This Moment he prepares her for thy Wishes, And brings her, blushing, to receive thy Vows. Iph. O sweet Relief! O unexpected Joy! Arc. Now good Amyntas have I kept my Word? Am. And doubly have rewarded my Obedience. Iph. And yet, alas, I fear. Now I may speak, My Heart retreats, and trembles to be heard. Arc. Who fears t'offend, takes the first Step to please. Iph. But I, in such high Nature have offendedâ Arc. Where the Offence is Love, the coldest Maid Seldom exacts Repentanceâsee she comes! By her fond Father's Hand conductedâcheer thy Heart. Enter Ãgon leading Ianthe, who stands some time silent: Iphis kneeling at a Distance. Ãg. AIR XII. A lovely Nymph, and Swain, At once adorn'd the Plain, For whom the rest, in vain, In Love were sighing. No Lass, who saw the Youth, But found her Heart in sooth All over Flame and Truth, And for him dying. But Oh! the Boy To all was coy, For he but one desir'd; The Nymph by all admir'd Made him surrender. The dainty Nymph, it seems, Was farther, in Extreams; For tho', tis true, She could subdue The Heart of every Swain: Yet all pursu'd in vain; None! none could bend her. Look there, my Darlingâ Arc. Fair Ianthe! Turn thy kinder Eyeâ Am. O lend thy pitying Ear. Ian. Methinks I stand, like a poor hunted Deer Within the Toil, by lifted Spears surrounded. What is my Crime? Why am I here the Point Of Publick Gaze, the Mark of chiding Eyes, And general Reproach? Whom have I wrong'd? Not Iphis sure! Unless my Friendship was injurious: That once betray'd, could I do less than end it? His Crime (Oh that my Memory could lose it!) I sooner shall forget, than dare to pardon. Iph. Ianthe, oh my Heart pines after thee! By all our playful Hours of Infant Life, Which almost Arm in Arm, our Innocence Delighted, and delighting has enjoy'd, By these my conscious Pangs of Friendship lostâ Ian. Thou hast defil'd it, Iphis, by Deceit! Iph. O yet restore, restore me to myself; Forgive, and call me to thy Friendship Home! Ian. 'Twas once my Pride! remember'd, 'tis my Shame. Iph. Alas, our Friendship was the Bloom of Love! And Love the Promise of the Tree perform'd. Is then the Fruit less pleasing than the Flower? Ian. Yesâthe white Hawthorn in its Bloom is fragrant, Its Fruit neglected, or the Food of Herds. Iph. O yet forgive! and never shall ungovern'd Love, In conscious Word, or Look, offend thy Virtue. Ian. That thou hast wrong'd me Once, is my Misfortune; If I am Twice deceiv'd, the Guilt be mine. [Going. Ãg. Ianthe, stayâ [She returns. Iph. Are These, Amyntas, my Deluded Hopes? [He rises, and leans on Amyn. Ãg. No, I compel thee not. Thy Heart shall ever, in thy Love, be free. Ian. Thus let my bending Knee be thankful! Say but my Heart is free! I ask no more. Ãg. Free as thy Bosom-Thoughtâ Arc. âYes, fair Ianthe, Howe'er my partial Fondness may regard A Son distrest, I still esteem thy Virtue; Nor, with thy Father's Power, would thwart thy Wishes. If thou art injur'd, right thy Maiden Wrongs; If Love wants Motives to compose thy Breast, The Voice of Power, or Interest, shall be neuter, And leave thee free to Pardon, or Resent. Ian. If I were capable of hating Iphis, This Goodness might remove it! No, my Lord, I am not yet so blinded by Resentment, But that I can allow his Virtues still Diffusive to the World: Why then am I Distinguish'd by Offence? With Grief I speak it, Why are those Virtues only blameable To me?â Iph. âCouldst thou behold thy Eyes, Ianthe, Thy chiding Wonder of my Crime might cease. Ian. Admit thy ill-plac'd Flattery were true, Is that Excuse for Fraud, and injur'd Kindness? For violated Faith, and sensual Insult? Iph. How can the Guilt of Iphis taint Ianthe? Ian. O weak Reply! 'tis not enough, that Maids Are innocent; they must be Thought so too. And she, whose violated Modesty Forgives, resents with a dissembled Anger. AIR XIII. No, no, to pardon, were but approving All that the Guilt of Love has done. Hearts that o'erlook Offences in loving, To their own Ruin blindly run. No, no, to pardon, &amp;c. Virtue relenting At humble repenting, Is but inviting Offence to go on. No, no, to pardon, &amp;c. She that dispenses With first Offences. But makes with Delight the Crime all her own. No, no, to pardon, &amp;c. Iph. Lyons and Tygers might be sooner tam'd, Than One obdurate Maid! Some pitying God Look down, dissolve her frozen Heart, relieve A Lover's Pain, and give her Eyes Compassion. AIR XIV. Iph. Cupid! Intreat her. Relentless Creature! Must I slighted yield my Breath? Ian. No. Iph. Have I leave to love you? Ian. No. Iph. Can my Ruine move you? Ian. No. Iph. In Pity, give me Life, or Death! Ian. No, no, no, no. Iph. O painful Station! Hard-fated Passion! Can Youth and Beauty, Nature defy? Ian. If Men have Right to love, Maids have to fly. Iph. Cupid! intreat her, &amp;c. [Iphis turning from Ianthe, dejected, leans against a Tree, while Amyntas seems to talk to her apart. Arc. I fear me, Ãgon, we have gone too far! Ianthe seems to triumph in the Power We gave, and strains it to a Cruelty. Ãg. Give Nature Time! This Tyde of Power may turn; Virgins grow seldom Old, in Cruelty. Their Tyranny is but a poor, short-liv'd Flower; With Pride it blooms, but sooner fades, than Beauty. Am. 'Tis true, Ianthe, thou art free to chuse; But something seems to that Indulgence due: Thou seest the generous Arcas, and thy Father, Though they impose not, recommend at least, And, in their Silence, chide thy Coldness. Ian. Leave me to pauseâVirtue! to thee, thus far, Implicit have I paid Obedience! Now Support, and cover with thy Wings my Weakness. [Aside. Am. If ever, Iphis, now resume thy Cause. Iph. Ianthe! though my Fault confess'd despairs Of Pardon, let me hope my Punishment At least extends not to thy rooted Hate! Divide, if possible, the Lover from The Friend; and to remember, that I, once, Was unoffending Iphisâwear this Trifle. [Offering his Crook. Ian. Accepted Presents, Iphis, are for Hearts In Amity, and therefore suit not me: Yet since, I find, the general Wish attends thee; In Proof, at least, that I suspend Resentment, One Gift I will receive, and only One. Iph. O! quick pronounce thy Pleasure, and relieve me! Ian. Relieve thy self; on thee Relief depends! Now, if thou canst, divine thy Life to come, For thus our Goddess has resolv'd thy Doom! Arc. Ãgon! Amyntas, hearâ Iph. âMy Soul attends thee! Ian. Know then, impatient to redress my Wrongs, this Morn Before the Holy Shrine of chast Diana I prostrate threw me, and implored her Aid: The Goddess smil'd propitious to my Prayers, And to resent the Stains of Iphis' Love, These Words her sacred Oracle pronounc'd. âThat which He cannot have, shall Iphis give; âThat, which Thou canst not give, or He desire: âThat which He must not have, must Thou receive, âThat! that's the Right thy present Wrongs require. Iph. What jangling Paradoxes rack my Brain! Arc. [Apart.] Can Love thro' Riddles only reach their Hearts? Ãg. [Apart.] When I was young, I always found it so. Ian. â'Till this, from Iphis She receive, âIanthe never shall forgive. âWhen Iphis plain this Riddle reads, âThen to his Wish, his Love succeeds. âNow turn thee, Iphis, to thy Art. âMean-while, like Friends compell'd, we part. Iph. Can Iphis from Ianthe fly? Ian. Will Iphis, what she asks, deny? AIR XV. Iph. Thus the plantive Exile sighs, Doom'd to leave his native Shore. Ian. Thus the cheerful Merchant tries Seas and Winds, for golden Oar. Iph. Winds, and Seas, with gentle Gales, Sometimes waft us to Repose; But the banish'd Lover sails, Wreck'd with every Wind that blows. Ian. Danger past delights the Mind; Life, if always calm, would cloy; In our proudest Hours, we find, Sweet Relief is all our Joy. Both. Sweet Relief, &amp;c. Iph. Death and Absence are the same. Ian. Absence tries a constant Flame. Iph. Constant Love should find Reward. Ian. Love should all Commands regard. Iph. Truth and Love sometimes persuade. Ian. Love and Fate will be obey'd. Both. Fate/Love and Love shall/Fate will be obey'd. [All but Ianthe go off. Ian. 'Tis done! his tender Passion is reveal'd. What I endure, lies here, a Load conceal'd. Call not for Pity, Iphis, of thy Pain; Unless thy Thoughts conceiv'd what mine sustain. My Love, by Pride suppress'd, was harder born Than all thy Anguish, from Ianthe's Scorn. Unequal, Nature, are thy Laws ordain'd! By thee, we're taught to love, by thee, restrain'd: While lordly Man no sooner feels thy Fire, Than he, unblam'd, avows the soft Desire, Melts with complaining Sighs our Hearts away, Till what, with Pain, we hide, our conscious Eyes betray.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. ARCAS and ÃGON. Arcas. O Ãgon! how shall I requite thy Love? Much for Amyntas' Virtue is thy Due; But for Ianthe more! A Female Mind, So greatly rais'd above her humble Fortune, So justly jealous of her Maiden Fame, So warm, yet graceful, in her firm Resentment; So fearful to forgive, so sweetly loath To punish, where paternal Pity pleaded! A Heart so finish'd in the Mold of Virtue Raises my Wonder high as my Content! These, Ãgon, these are Blessings, from thy Care Deriv'd, which Arcas never can repay. Ãg. Has not your equal Care of my Pastora More than repay'd the Debt of your Ianthe? And does not Iphis ballance your Amyntas? Talk not of Obligations then, unless You would inquire, what Ãgon owes to Arcas! Arc. Let them be mutual then: what Virtue gives Is always so: When Friends, on Friends, confer, To give, or to receive, is equal Pleasure. Now tell me, Ãgon, speak thy real Thoughts, What must we judge of cold Ianthe's Conduct? Ãg. That Education has assisted Nature, And given her Prudence to conceal her Love. Arc. Her Love! why was the Riddle then impos'd? For, if she loves, her Hopes are there in Hazard: If Iphis never should have Skill to solve it, On her own Heart her Cruelty recoils. Ãg. 'Tis true: but Nature is, in female Hearts, So shy, they sometimes will endure more Pain To hide, than to accomplish their Desires. But here, alas! the Danger's soon remov'd. 'Tis but her whispering some Bosom-friend, Who kindly may betray the Trust to Iphis. Arc. Suppose she never make that Trust!â Ãg. âKnow then, That I, myself, already have unty'd it. Arc. 'Tis more than I can reach; explain itâ Ãg. âNo. Your Heart's too tender to conceal it long. You, on the first Distress of Iphis, would assist him. Arc. Well! take thy own Course, till proper time demand it. Now, Ãgon, turn we to our other Care. Philautus is this Day arriv'd from Corinth In gorgeous Pomp, to make his Conquest sure; The Fame, he tells me, of my Daughter's Charms, Hath drawn him from the Crowd of Courtly Beauties, Whose Rival Hearts, in vain, have sigh'd to hold him, To lay his Fortunes at Pastora's Feet. Ãg. This Froth and Vanity must yield us Sport. Arc. I leave his Follies, Ãgon, to thy Charge; Thy Jovial Tongue will play upon his Pride, And better sound the Shallows of his Heart. But I must, as befits his Birth, receive him: Nor, for his Father's sake, must slight his Weakness. Pastora shall be inform'd of his Arrival: Bring thou Amyntas to their Interview: Where, when he sees, in form, the high Philautus By my own Hand presented to Pastora, Then shall we prove, how far his secret Flame Can bear a Rival, or deserve a Mistress. Ãg. First, let me trespass on your gentle Patience: This Way I see old Corydon advancing: He comes, by my Appointment, to complain Of some Abuse, that's offer'd to his Daughter; And hopes, that your Authority will right him. Arc. 'Tis true! somewhat of this Pastora told me. Ãg. He's here, with all the Parties, to attend you. Enter Corydon, Phillida, Cimon, Mopsus, Damon, and other Shepherds. Cor. May all our Gods preserve the noble Arcas, Lord of our Lands, and Flocks.â Arc. âGood Neighbours, welcome! What seems amiss, that may concern your Welfare? Cor. Ah! my good Lord, I have no Skill to speech it, But Grief at Heart will always find a Tongue. My Lord, this home-bred Maid I call my Daughter, She's all I have, and all my Hope; now I Would gladly see her well dispos'd in Marriage. And that she might not dye a Maid, unask'd, I have declar'd one half of what I have Her Dow'r, in present; at my Death, the rest. 'Tis true, 'tis little; but still, the Half is Half! Now here, so please you, I have found her out A pair of wholesome Youths, to take her Choice of: Brothers they be, Sons of my Neighbour Dorus, This is call'd Cimon, and the younger Mopsus! Their Means, and Manners, suit her Breeding well, And both profess their Hearts are set upon her. Cim. Yes, and please you, Both cruelly in Love. [Half crying. Cor. Nay pr'ythee, Cimon, let me tell my Story. Arc. A little Patience, Friendâ Mop. âHoh! hoh! hoh! hoh! That Fool my Brother's always in the wrong! Cor. Fy! fy! Mopsus! now thou art worse than he. Arc. On with thy Taleâ Cor. âNow, Sir, these Lads, I say, Were nothing in the way to cross their Courtship, Might one or t'other make her a good Husband. But here, here, an't please you, lies our Grief! The wilful Girl is scornful to them both. And why? because, forsooth! she loves another! But how! how is her Love dispos'd? Why thus! This pranking gamesome Boy, this Damon here! With Songs, and Gambols, has I think bewitch'd her His Pipe, it seems, has play'd her sweeter Sounds, And all the idle Day they toy and sing together. Cim. Ay so they do, and please youâ Cor. Nay, nay, Cimon! Cim. Well, well! I've done: but I'm sure it's true tho'â Cor. So nothing now will down with her but Damon. And what will Damon do? Why, ruin her! The Lamb that's in the hungry Fox's Mouth, Has little Hope to scape being made his Breakfast: For he declares he ne'er intends to marry, And openly defies my Power to force him. A hard Defiance to a tender Father! [Weeps. Now, good my Lord! 'tis true you're not our King, And therefore none are bound, by Law, to obey you. But you've a stronger Tye o'er us, our Hearts. The Man were branded here, that scorn'd your Pleasure. And the great Good you do us every Day, Will make your Word go farther, than a Law: So if your Pity think my Case is hard, I leave the Manner how, to your great Wisdom; And hope your Goodness will prevent a Father's Sorrow. Arc. O Ãgon! how affecting is the Tongue Of plain SimplicityâThe honest Wretch! He moves me more with Nature's Eloquence, Than all the Points of our Athenian Orators. Thy Grief, good Corydon, I take to Heart, And, to my poor Extent of Power, will serve thee. But hear we now, what others may reply. Damon, thou 'ast heard this good old Man's Complaint; Why hast thou dallied with this Maid's Affection? Dam. My Lord, I mean the Lass no harm, not I: 'Tis true, I like her Lip, and so I do Some twenty others; and twenty others may Have all the same Demand to marry me! But, 'las-a-day! tho' Kissing goes by Favour, A Man can't marry every Girl he kisses! Were that a Claim, then she, that first was kiss'd, Should first be married; so I hope, my Lord, I shall not be bound to do One right, in wrong To Hundreds, that should come, in turn, before her. Ãg. Sirrah! thou mak'st thy Perjuries a Sport, And think'st thy Wit excuses Wickedness. Dam. Not so hard, good Master; for Maids sometimes Are slippery Bits, as well as we; and he That has but one poor String to his Bow, if that Should fly, will find but sorry Sport a shooting. Ãg. Knave! thou'rt a Nusance; all thy Neighbours note thee For a Poacher: When Nuts are ripe, he cracks You half the Apron-strings, around the Country. Arc. Gently, Ãgon; let us suspend Reproof, That we may hear, without Disguise, his Thoughts. Well Damon, what Amends to Corydon? What shall I say I'have done to right his Daughter? Dam. Why let the Damsel please her self, my Lord; If she's dispos'd to marry, there's her Choice. If to make Life a FrolickâHere's her Man. There's no great Hardship, where the Will is free: As she must first consent, before she kisses, I hope she'll first have mine, before I marry. For though some Men have hang'd themselves for Maids, Yet, I have known my Betters think a Wife The worst of Halters; so whate'er betide me, I hope, you won't make Marriage, Sir, my Sentence! Arc. Think'st thou a virtuous Bride, a Punishment? Dam. A Halter made of Silk's a Halter still. And as the Song wisely says, my Lord, AIR I. The Man, for Life, That takes a Wife, Is like a thousand dismal Things: A Fox in Trap, Or worse, may hap; An Owl, in Cage, that never sings. Dull, from Morn to Night He hates her Sight, Yet he, poor Soul! must endure it. Bed of Thorns! Head of Horns! Such a Life! Rope, or Knife, Can only cure it. II. A Bull at Stake, To merry make, He roars aloud, and the Laugh is strong! Like Dog, and Cat, Or Puss, and Rat, He fights for Life, and it lasts as long. But the Man that's free, Is like the Bee, While every Flower he's tasting. Never cloys, With his Joys: Day, or Night, New Delight Is only lasting. Cor. You see, Sir, I have not accus'd him falsly; He owns himself more wicked, than I spoke him. Arc. 'Tis true, as such we shall consider him. Well, my good Friends, I hope what you propose [To Cim. and Mop. Will shew your Hearts are of an honest Mold. There stands the Maid; if you have ought to urge, That may prefer your Hopes to Damon's, Take this Occasion to avow your Love: You have her Father's Wish, and my Protection. Cim. Ah! Sir, an' like you, I 'have no Heart to speak; She flouts, and glowts, at me, from Morn to Night. She how she looks now! 'cause she can't avoid me. Arc. Take Courage, Man; 'tis but her Maiden Shyness. Cim. D'ye think so, Sir? Why then I will take Heart! If an old Song will do the Thing, have at her. AIR II. There's not a Swain, On the Plain, Would be blest as I, O could you but, could you but, on me smile: But you appear So severe, That trembling with Fear, My Heart goes pit a pat! pit a pat! all the while! When I cry, Must I dye? You make no Reply, But look shy, And with a scornful Eye, Kill me with your Cruelty: How can you be, can you be, How can you be, so hard to me? Ah! poor Cimon, thou art ne'er the nearer! Not all thy Sighs, nor Songs, nor Sobs can move her! [Crying. Cor. You see, my Lord, the Lad tho'fearful, in His Heart is honestly dispos'd however. Arc. Perhaps she may be more inclin'd to Mopsus. Ãg. Come, Mopsus, now for thee, thy Heart seems cheerful. Mop. Ay! 'twas always so: I love to laugh, Let things go how they will: why let her frown! As long as Cimon's us'd as ill as I, It gives ones Mind a little Ease however! Happen as 'twill, I shall have him to laugh at! So, as he's for singing an old Song sadly, 'Twill be but sad, to try a new one merrily. AIR III. When Phillida milks her Cow, How have I stood smirking? Oh! the pretty Stream would flow, With a Jerk, and a Jerk in! Thy whiter Bosom too so heav'd, Half out, and half in! That of my Breath I was bereav'd, With a Fit of laughing! I could not hold from lauâghing! Half out, and half in! Oh! to see them fall, and rise, I laugh'd, till I lost my Eyes: Half out, and half in! And it was the purest Sight, E'er gave Delight, From Morn to Night, I could ha' died, with laughing, With laughâing. Ãg. Well said, Mopsus! Thou sing'st it, from thy Heart, And 'tis a merry oneâ Mop. âBetter than crying. Cor. Ah! Sir, we poor Swains have but homely Words, To speak our Minds; but what we say, we stand to. Arc. An honest Principle: Now, my good Friend; Let us inquire into thy Daughter's Heart: For that must guide usâ Cor. âPhillida, come near! Arc. Well, my fair Maid! is there, within my Power, Ought, that may contribute to thy Happiness? Of all these Youths, for thou art free to chuse, Which is the Swain comes nearest to thy Heart? Phill. Since I am forc'd to speak the Truth, my Lord, I own my Heart has play'd a simple Game; I know my Father's Kindness means we well, And I could wish I had the Power to please him; But I am loath to lead a Savage Life: And sure! these Lads were woeful Company. Cim. O scornful Maid! my Heart will burst with Grief! [Cries. Mop. Hoh! hoh! poor Cimon's in a bitter taking! [Laughs. Phill. 'Twere hard to chuse, from such Extreams of Folly! Damon, with all his Infidelities, Seems not to me, Sir, half so terrible! And I am more, than much afraid, I love him! 'Tis true, I know him fickle, false, and faithless! And I have try'd a thousand, thousand times, To shut him from my Thoughts, but 'twill not do! When e'er my Heart is open, in he comes! Again submits, and is again forgiven! Again I love, and am again forsaken! Yet still he fools me on; and when he's absent, With Sighs, and Songs, I thus relieve my Folly. AIR IV. What Woman could do, I have try'd, to be free; Yet do all I can, I find I love him, and tho' he flies me, Still, still he's the Man. They tell me, at once, he to twenty will swear: When Vows are so sweet, who the Falshood can fear? So, when you have said all you can, Stillâstill he's the Man. II. I caught him once making Love to a Maid, When to him I ran. He turn'd, and he kiss'd me, then who could upbraid So civil a Man? The next Day I found to a Third he was kind, I rated him soundly, he swore, I was blind; So, let me do what I can, Stillâstill he's the Man. III. All the World bids me beware of his Art: I do what I can; But he has taken such hold of my Heart, I doubt he's the Man! So sweet are his Kisses, his Looks are so kind, He may have his Faults, but if I none can find, Who can do more than they can; Heâstill is the Man. Arc. Take Comfort, Corydon; all yet may mend: Thy Daughter's frank Confession of her Love Persuades me, of her guarded Innocence! And though licentious Damon may deserve Severe Reproof; yet for the Maiden's sake (For what he suffers, her fond Heart will feel) We will not harden him, by Punishment, But rather tempt him by Reward, to Virtue. Of this bad matter make we then the best. If therefore, Damon, thou, or any Swain, By Suit, or Service of his Love, can woe, And win this gentle Maid, to be his Bride, The Dow'r, which her kind Father has declar'd, My self will double, on her Marriage-day, And give him, with her Hand, my father Favour. Cor. May all the Gods preserve the bounteous Arcas. A double Portion! Now, my honest Lads, There's brave Encouragement to warm your Hearts! Now shew your Skill, and who's the featest Fellow! Now sing, and dance her down to your Desires! Now, Phillida, let faithless Damon see What Love, and Honesty have gain'd, by Truth; And what his Pranks have lost by Wickedness. Phill. Dishonestly shall never gain on me Mop. A double Dowry, Cimon; now's our Time! Cim. Ay, but I'm tender-hearted; my poor Hopes Will never blossom, while she looks so frosty! Cor. Learn of thy Brother, Lad; thou seest he knows No Fear, nor Grief: Up with thy Heart, and at her. Cim. Well then, since you encourage me, I will. Cor. Well said, my Boy! Ah! this joyful Day Has set my Heart upon the merry Pin! When I was young, 'twas thus I play'd the Sweetheart. AIR V. When I follow'd a Lass, that was froward, and shy, O! I stuck to her Stuff, till I made her comply! O! I took her so lovingly round the Waste, And I smack'd her Lips, and I held her fast! When hugg'd, and hall'd, She squeal'd, and squall'd; And tho' she vow'd, all I did was in vain! Yet I pleas'd her so well, that she bore it again! Yet I pleas'd, &amp;c. Then hoity toity! Whisking, frisking, Green was her Gown upon the Grass; O! such was the Joy of our dancing Days! O! such was the Joy of our dancing Days! Arc. Well done, my merry Heart! Come, Corydon, Now let us leave these Lovers free to woe, And he that first subduing, and subdued, Comes Hand in Hand, to ask her Bridal Dow'r, In farther Token of my Love, my self Will crown him with a Chaplet, worth his wearing. Ãg. Now for the Garland!â Mop. âLive the noble Arcas! Arc. Ãgon! bring thou Amyntas to the Grove Of Citrons, there Pastora shall receive Philautus. [Ex. Arcas and Ãgon severally. Cor. âLet me but live to see that Knave, That graceless Damon bobb'd! let him but wear The Willow! I'll jump into my Grave, With Joyâ [Exit Cor. Dam. (aside ...) So! now have I probably All my whole Work to do over again! This double Dow'r, no doubt, will turn her Brain, And set the Wind-mill of her Sex a going.(... aside). Mop. Now! Cimon, now! Cim. âI'd rather you'd speak first. Mop. No, you are the Elderâ Cim. âBut my Heart misgives me. Phill. Still silent! no kind Offer yet from Damon? Has Fortune no Effect upon his Heart? [Aside. Cim. No, no, I tell you, I shall never hit The Tune aloneâ Mop. âWell then, be sure you back me. AIR VI. [Mop.] Tell me, Philly, tell me roundly, When you will your Heart surrender? Cim. Faith, and Troth! I love thee woundly, And I was the first Prentender. Mop. Of us Boys, Cim. Take thy Choice: Mop. Here's a Heartâ Cim. âAnd here's a Hand too. Mop. His, or mine, Cim. All is thine. Both âBody and Goods at thy Command too. Phill. How harsh and tedious is the Voice Of Love, from any but the Voice desir'd! AIR VII. While you both pretend a Passion, 'Twould be Cruel to chuse either; To preserve your Inclination, I must kindly fix on neither. To be just, I now must Make yours, and yours be equal Cases: Therefore pray, From this Day, I never may behold your Faces. Now be silent; if Damon is inclin'd To speak, his turn is next, you've had your Answer. Mop. Well! let him speak! mayhap your Face May get as little good from him, as ours From you; 'tisn't every Man will marry you; Don't cry, Cimon; it only makes her prouder. Cim. She has given me such a kick o'the Heart, I shall never recover itâ Phill. âHark thee, Cimon! I like thee better than thy Brother far. Cim. O! the Gracious! do you truly, and truly? Phill. I'll give thee Proof this Instant! take him hence, And keep him from my sight, an Hour at least. And when thou seest me next, come thou without him. Cim. Give me thy Hand on'tâ Phill. âHush! not now, they'll see us. Away with himâ Cim. A Word's enoughâI'll do't. Come, Mopsus, come awayâfor I have a thing, And such a thing to tell thee, Boyâ Mop. What ails The Fool! Thou'rt mad! Cim. âMad! Ay, and so would you Be too, were my Case yours; but come away. Mop. Nay, not so fast, good Cimonâ Cim. âFaster, Mopsus, faster. [Cimon hurries off Mopsus. Dam. My charming Creature! this was kindly done! Never was Favour, to a Fool, so well Dissembled!â Phill. Yes, I have learn'd, from you, Dissembling. And you'll again dissemble, to reward me. Dam. Why so suspicious, Phillida? Don't I love thee? Why all this Bustle, at my Heart, when thus I touch thy Hand, or gaze upon thy Eyes! Give me thy Lips, and see how thou'rt mistaken. Phill. No, Damon; Lips are but liquorish Proofs Of Love, and thine too often have deceiv'd me. Dam. AIR VIII. âAway with Suspicion, That Bane to Desire; The Heart that loves truly, all Danger defies: The Rules of Discretion But stifle the Fire; On its Merit alone, true Beauty relies. What Folly to tremble, Lest the Lover dissemble? His Fire? Turtles that woe, Bill and Cooe: While we enjoy We must be true! And to repeat it, is all, All! we can desire. Phill. 'Tis thus thou always hast decoy'd my Heart! Thou know'st I love, and therefore wouldst undo me. Dam. I know thou lovest, and therefore would secure thee. Phill. AIR IX. While you pursue me, Thus to undo me, Sure Ruin lies in all you say. To bring your toying, Up to enjoying, Call first the Priest, and name the Day; Then, then name the Day. Lasses are willing As Lads, for billing, When Marriage Vows are kindly prest. Let holy Father Tye us together, Then bill your Fill, and bill your best; Then, then bill your best. Dam. What, not a Hand, a Lip, for old Acquaintance? Not one poor Sample of the Grain, my Dear, Unless I make a Purchase of the whole? Phill. No, Damon; now 'tis time to end our Fooling. Consent to wed me, or forbear to love. Dam. What! dost thou think to starve me into Marriage? Phill. I'll starve my self, but I'll avoid thy Falshood! Graze where thou wilt, I'll feed no ranging Lovers. Dam. Noânor I won't be pounded, while I can leap A Hedge: So keep your Grass for Calves to graze on. I need not go a Mile for Pasture, Dame, And good as any Meal that you can make me. Phill. Do, leave me, do, and prove thy self a Traytor! Faithless, Inhumane Damon!â Dam. âMighty well! This double Dow'r, I find, has turn'd thy Brain! And thou would'st make me madder than thy self! A Husband! Death! a Mill-horse! what, to grind, And grind, in one poor hopeless Round of Life! To-day, to-morrow, and to-morrow, still To plod the Path, I trod the Day before! O! methinks I feel the Collar on my Shoulders! Phill. Abandon'd Damon! now I begin to hate thee. Dam. I'm glad, my Mistress, that you'll speak your Mind! Some Girls will fool you on till one's Heart aches. But since I know your Play, Forsooth, hang lag, Say I, and so farewell, fair Phillida. AIR X. Dam. I'll range the World, where Freedom reigns, And scatter Love around the Plains. Phill. I'll starve my Love, and rather part, Than yield my Hand, to fool my Heart. Dam. The Frowns of This, I ne'er take Ill: Where One denies, there's Two that will. Phill. Since Maids by Kindness are undone; Adieu, Mankind; I'll sigh for none. Dam. No frozen Lass shall hold me long. Phill. No Swain, that's false, my Love shall wrong. Dam. Farewell! farewellâ'tis time to part. Phill. Thus from thy Hold, I tear my Heart. Both. Farewell! farewell, &amp;c. The SCENE changes to a Pleasant Garden adjoining to the House of Arcas. Enter Arcas conducting Philautus, with Ãgon and Amyntas. Arc. Once more you're welcome, to our Cottage, Sir; And what is wanting in Magnificence, Shall be supply'd in Will, and Wishes, to delight you. Phil. Your civiliz'd Deportment still retains The Courtierâthat sufficesâYou are polite. You know my Birth, and what my Rank requires. And tho' my Life has always stream'd with Pleasures, I love sometimes t'unbend from crowded Courts, And snuff the Rural AirâYour Hounds are good? Arc. Of the old Spartan Breed: All staunch as Truth, High-mettled on the Scent, and in full Cry The jolly Chorus thunders in the Vale. A sporting Stag will better speak their Virtue. Phil. We'll find an early Day. And now, my Lord, Nothing seems wanting to compleat my Welcome, But fair Pastora, and the Field before me! A started Beauty strains me into Speed, And like the Greyhound sweeps me to the Quarry. Arc. Courtiers have Arts to make their Conquests easy; But where the Skilful, and the Graceful join, Our Rural Virgins must on sight surrender. Phil. She will not find it easy to escape me. Ãg. Sure, she will not find it difficult to try! [Aside. Phil. In Court, our Dames have prov'd me, to their Cost. Arc. She gains a Conquest, that's by you subdued! Phil. Polite, and Courtly! finely turn'd, my Lord! She gains a Conquest, that's by you subdued! She does indeed! for I'm not easily pleas'd. Ãg. She is, I'm sure, that can be pleas'd with thee. [Aside. Phil. I, sometimes, have been Nice to Cruelty. Ãg. If Modesty can charm, she's lost indeed! Arc. But we delay my Daughter's Happiness: Your Leave a moment, to conduct her. [Ex. Arcas. Amyn. What sudden Terrors have o'ercast my Heart? Ãg. Well, Sir, we now shall see your Courtly Skill! But let me tell you, that our homebred Nymphs, However easy to the humble Lover, Can to the Heart, that comes assur'd of Conquest, Assume a Pride, regardless as the Wind, When on the Mountain's Head it bends the Cedar. Phil. The Rural Bluntness, Ãgon, much delights me: We sometimes have, in Court, a Droll, like thee. And when the Oddness of a Creature's pleasant, We join the Laugh, and give their Humours way. Ãg. Just as we sometimes treat a Coxcomb here. For now and then they come to steal our Daughters: Though I ne'er heard their Sighs have much prevail'd. Phil. But, honest Ãgon, thou shalt find, we Courtiers Have sharper Darts, than simple Sighs, to shoot with. The Skilful do not ask, but give Relief. Ãg. Our simple Swains would thank you for that Secret. For they are always humble, till the Nymph Is kind; and then they're simply grateful too. Phil. O Rustick Notions! No, dear Ãgon, no. A Woman's Pride is pamper'd by our Fear: He only can reduce that dares provoke it. Ãg. A Courage so determin'd must be sure Of Conquest, Sir,âBut see! your fair Defiance. Enter Arcas with Pastora. Arc. This, my Pastora, is the Noble Youth, Whom my Approvement offers to thy Choice: High is his Lineage, his Appointments equal: But my weak Praise would wrong his full Deservings; Thou art thy self to judge of his Perfections, For nothing is impos'd upon thy Will: The brave Philautus scorns Advantages, And leaves his Cause to Love, that thy free Heart May rather soften, to his own Persuasions, Than yield reluctant, with a cold Obedience. Phil. Yes, lovely Maid! compell'd Affection stains The Lover's Glory, and degrades his Conquest! The generous Heart disclaims all Aids, but Love! Yet be compos'd, I'll use a gentle Power: I know the Terrors that invade your Sex, When Love first makes his Onset of Desire; Your Beauties tremble! and your Charms retreat! I therefore shall a while suspend my Vows, 'Till your own secret Wishes sigh to hear them. All I, in present, shall propose, is first, That with an Eye impartial you survey me; Hear with Attention, willing to admire; Then when you are inclin'd to speakâspeak free! Nor let your Virgin Coyness veil your Heart. Past. Sir, I must own you have already cur'd My Fears, those Fears, that ere you spoke, oppress'd me. At one short View, I read your Mind, and Person! Which equally have given Surprize, and Wonder! And since so generously you use your Power, As not t'uenforce it, with a Father's Will; The least I can in Gratitude return, Is not alone to hear; but, on the Place, To answer what I hear: You may proceed. There seems no Terror in a Courtier's Love! Phil. A Heart so dauntless stirs my Emulation! But let me tell you, Fair One, you have now Before your Eyes no common-moulded Lover; A Man less us'd to ask, than to refuse Your Sexes Favours! Beauty may have Eyes, Yet Men have Arts to give alternate Wounds. Thousands may hope, but few have equal Charms To fix a curious Heartâand yet, methinks Your Eye, my Fair, darts an unusualâsomethingâ That calls for farther gazingâ [After a long Pause, his Looks rising gradually to a gracious Approbation, he proceeds. âVirgin! You Have BeautyâI confess it; to be just, I own your Charms are worthy of my Thought; On your own Conduct, now, depends your Happiness! Past. A Heart, that to our Sex has been so fatal, Deterrs the Passion which its Worth wou'd raise, Or leads th'Unwary to avoidless Ruin: And, to be free, I dare not trust you with Esteem. Phil. Agreeable Suspicion! but I'll ease Your Fears, and make your Hopes, at once, Your Sexes Envy, and your Swains Despair. Come, come, I read your Soul! such tender Scruples Never arise, but from the Heart inclining; The Lover scorn'd is never tax'd with Falshood. You see, my Fair, I know the Depths of Love, And all your coy Meanders of the Heart. Past. How can you triumph, where you've won so little? Phil. This Modesty alone were worth my Conquest. Past. I find, Sir, I dispute your Happiness in vain. And since I can't persuade you to Despair, Thus let me warn our Sexes Vanity: AIR XI. No more, vain Virgins, boast your Power; For Nature is inverted: To be blest, you must adore, Or be by Swains deserted. Sweet Lovers now, at Sight, surprize, And give such wondrous Pleasure, That when the Nymph, despairing, dies, The Swain will deign to ease her. Phil. Engaging Creature! what remains, is now The Means to make your Conqueror, your Captive. An easy Taskâbut I'll explain the Secret. AIR XII. Tho' you, perhaps, my lovely Fair, Have Charms that greatly move me; Yet all your future Pains, and Care, Must be, to make me love you. Your Fate alone depends on me, You are but what I make you; Divinely blest, if I prove true, Undone, if I forsake you. [Phil. turns to Ãg. Past. (aside ...) Nay then, 'tis time to undeceive his Folly! But it repays the Pain, to find Amyntas Has been the Witness of our Interview: Sure the Contempt this Trifler has receiv'd, Will justify my Heart, and still preserve That soft Esteem, which he has ever shewn me.(... aside) Arc. (apart ...) Well, good Amyntas, tell me, and in Friendship, What are thy Thoughts of this Corinthian Noble? Would'st thou not wish Pastora to receive him, And give her Charms th'Improvement of a Court?(... apart) Am. (apart ...) Your Wisdom, doubtless, had resolv'd, before Pastora saw him, Sirâ(... aside) Arc. (apart ...) Suppose it so, Yet I would gladly know how far thy Sense May recommend, or disapprove, this Union.(... aside) Am. Since you descend, to ask a young Man's Counsel, That mine, Sir, may be better justified, Permit me to recite, what you yourself Have oft commended, as the Virgin's Lesson. Tho' much, I fear, my Skill will marr the Musick. Ãg. No matter; thou, at least, wilt give it Meaning. Am. That, Sir, were worthy of Pastora's Ear. AIR XIII. Virgins, beware how you fix on a Lover! Beds of Flowers may harbour a Snake; Gold and Silver gayly may cover Heads that wander, and Hearts that forsake. Courtly Rovers, When bound for Life, Seldom Lovers Prove to the Wife. But on the Plains poor Swains are true; Nor love themselves, but die for You. Phil. Poor Swain! some slighted Lover, I presume! Ãg. A Lover favour'd, or my Eyes deceive me. [Aside. Arc. 'Tis well apply'd, Amyntasâfollow me. I have of Moment something for thy Ear. A Lover, Sir, like you, that knows the Coast, [To Phil. Needs not a Pilot, when so near the Shore: I therefore leave you to compleat your Conquest. Phil. Your Complaisance has made Arcadia, Corinth. Arc. Daughter, with Joy, I have beheld thy Conduct! I see thou know'st to value Men, by Merit. And that thy Heart may act more open to Thy Wishes, I retireâmaintain thy Virtue. [Ex. Arcas and Amyntas. Ãgon following, is detain'd by Philautus. Past. (apart ...) What can this mean? Is then my Father pleas'd With the Contempt I have thrown upon this Stranger, Whom he himself presented? Can it be? 'Twas by his Leave too, that Amyntas sung, Encourag'd to address his Strains to me. Take heed, fond Heart, nor flatter thy Desires. Let Time, that undertakes thy Fate, confirm it.(... aside) Phil. Believe me, Ãgon, I desire thy Presence. Without a Friend, a Mistress loses half Her Charms. I love a Witness of my Power. For what's a Triumph, where there's no Spectator? All my Successes with the Fair are publick. Ãg. Well, Sir, I'll stay, in hopes that your fair Mistress May, in her turn, have Cause to triumph too. Phil. 'Tis true, my Friend; my Favour is her Triumph; Thou seest, we Courtiers know a shorter way Than Sighing, to the Heartâ Ãg. â'Tis short indeed! For I perceive not yet, you've said one Word, So much to raise her Merit, as your own. Phil. Whyânoânot but I slightly own'd her Charms Had Power, and that's enough! The Art of Love Is not to praise your Fair One to a Goddess, But to dissolve her Pride, with Admiration, And be yourself the Object of Desire. Ãg. Ay! there! you have, beyond Belief, succeeded. Phil. But I have farther Subject for her Wonder. Now, my fair Nymph! not that my Heart is vain, But yet to show the Value of your Conquest; Permit me, to inform you of the Fate Of a fam'd Roman Beauty, who at Corinth Hearing of my intended Marriage, took A mortal Draught, which ended, with her Hopes Of me, her Life; and in her latest Pangs, Turning her faint complaining Eyes upon me, Farewel, vain faithless World, she cry'd! I die A Victim to Papilio's Cruelty! Past. Papilio!â Phil. âThe Name her Fondness gave me. Ãg. Papilio! Phil. âYes: a Roman Appellation. Observe its melting SoftnessâO! Papilio! Sure, 'twas the gentlest Creature!âbut however, To give her, even in Death, her due Revenge, And to immortalize her Passion, I Compos'd an Ode, which the fam'd Sappho might With Pride have own'd, and not have wrong'd her Genius. Past. May we intreat the Favour, Sir, to hear it? Phil. My Voice, I doubt, will ill commend the Lines; But what that wants, Expression shall supply. AIR XIV. Cruel Creature, Must I languish! Savage Nature! See my Anguish; Doom'd to love, and love in vain! O Papilio! Can you fly me? Can you, will you Still deny me! O Papilio! One kind Look, to sooth my Pain! Cruel Creature, See my Anguish! Hear a dying Maid complain! Ãg. This is indeed a doleful Ditty, Sir. Past. How could you let so soft a Creature perish? Phil. Love, like Ambition, rashly seeks its Ruin. Her Fondness set no Bounds to her Desire. She grasp'd at more, than was her Beauty's Due. Was mine a Heart to be ingross'd by One; Where a whole Court had equal Claim to Favour? Past. Ye Powers! are these your Principles avow'd? Are then the Laws of Honour, Nature, thus Regarded?â Ãg. (aside ...) âSo! his Vanity, at last, Recoils upon himself, and gives her Scorn The fair Excuse of Honour, to renounce him.(... aside) Phil. And why, my Fair, so suddenly transported? Past. Could you then think, a Heart, like yours, so stain'd In Cruelty, could find Reception here? Phil. I thought a Heart so eminently graced With Conquests, only could deserve Pastora. Past. No! to the Manes of your Roman Mistress, That wretched Martyr of your cruel Nature, My vengeful Hate shall make your Love the Victim. AIR XV. How, inhumane faithless Creature! Could'st thou wrong such tender Youth? How, against all Sense of Nature, Kill such Innocence, and Truth? While thou sing'st her mournful Ditty, Base, remorseless, false Ingrate! Her Distresses move my Pity, And for thee, my mortal Hate. Phil. What new Extravagance of Love, my Fair, Has chang'd thy Gentleness to Jealousy? Can a dead Rival's Charms disturb thee?â Past. âYes! The Charms that had so well deserv'd thy Heart, Finding such cruel Treatment from thy Power, Confirm, what Charms inferior must expect, And warn the Wary to detest thy Love! Phi. Nay now, thy Tenderness refines to Folly. Past. Hence! from my Sight, lest worse than Scorn attend thee. Ãg. I doubt, Sir, here our Triumph has been pusht Too farâ Phi. â'Tis true! the Tender in her Heart Prevails, and therefore, with the Tender, still Must be recall'd, and softned to her Wishes. AIR XVI. Must I despair? Kill me, but kill me here! Here, at your Feet I'll dye, But, from your Sight to fly, Is more than Love, or Life, can bear! Still cold and cruel be, Dart from your Eyes Disdain; Yet while those Eyes I see Some Pleasure still relieves the Pain Kill me, but &amp;c. Past. (apart ...) How, Ãgon, shall I rid me of this Folly? The more his Love's abus'd, the more his Pride Perverts my Meaning, and evades the Scorn.(... aside) Ãg. Give him a hearty farewel, and retire. Past. He has, indeed, reduc'd me to explain. Phil. 'Tis done, my Friend; again her softning Eyes Incline to pardon, and resume Desire! And to pursue my Conquestâthusâ Past. âForbear! Since, Sir, I find your high Opinion of Yourself can take Aversion, for Esteem; Enjoy your Happiness, but molest not mine. Admire your self, and shew a manly Spirit! Despise my Frowns, and give me Scorn for Scorn. Fly to some nobler Heart that tastes your Merit, And leave Pastora to bemoan her Folly. Ãg. (apart ...) Troth, Sir, I think 'twould be a fair Revenge.(... aside) Phi. (apart ...) Ãgon, I know what Measures will become me.(... apart) Past. AIR XVII. How happy's the Man, that like you, Sir, His pretty dear Person admires! Who, when with the Fair it won't do, Sir, Content to his Idol retires. He turns to his Glass, Where, in his sweet Face, Such ravishing Beauties disclose; His Heart on fire, Is sure his Desire No Rival will ever oppose. But when to a Nymph a Pretender, Poor Mortal, he splits on a Shelf! How little a Thing will defend her From one, that makes Love to himself! While nice in Dress, And sure of Success, He thinks she can never get free; With smiling Eyes, She rallies, and flies, And laughs at his Merit, like me. [Exit Pastora. Ãg. Was ever such a strange Relapse! Phil. âSurprizing! Ãgon, I fear Disorder in her Brain! Didst thou observe, how incoherently She sung, and wander'd from her soft Deportment? Ãg. 'Tis plain, she is not what we thought herâ Phil. âNo! It must be Frenzy! Love has strange Effects! This is the strongest Arrow, that I ever drew! Ãg. So strong, I doubt, we have over-shot the Mark! At least, I see, you have not touch'd her Wings! Phil. AIR XVIII. O! let her go! Pooh! let her go! Maids like wounded Doves will fly: The pretty thing, Tho' on the Wing, Down must fall, and sure to dye! In her Heart, The Dart She flies with, Has fixt her sure; Now! now! She's panting for the Cure! No, Ãgon, no! 'tis now too late to fly me. I know I've touch'd her, and my Shafts are fatal! In the next neighbouring Grove, she drops of course! There I shall find her helpless, in her Wounds, And tame to my Desire: But I must follow, And, like a skilful Woodman, save my Game. Thy Presence, Ãgon, frightned her away! 'Twas too far carried, to have others see The soft Confusion of her yielding Heart; Which, if alone, had been with Joy disclos'd. Ãg. Of what strange Stuff are Courtiers Heads compos'd! [Exeunt. The SCENE changes to an outward Part of a Grove. Enter Arcas and Amyntas. Arc. Amyntas, I have weigh'd thy best Excuses, And find thy Modesty, that makes them, but A stronger Motive to my Trust propos'd: If thou would'st keep thy Place within my Heart, Comply with my Desiresâ Am. âMy noble Lord, Since Diffidence no longer can dissuade, My due Obedience with your Will complies: To my poor Power, I will discharge this Trust. Arc. Now thou hast gain'd upon my Love, Amyntas. The present Hour employs thee: Here, within This Grove, a while amuse thee, 'till I send her: There, in an Instant, shall Pastora find thee. [Exit Arcas. Am. What will my Fate do with me! O Pastora! Is lost Amyntas, then, the chosen Wretch, To point thee out a Lover worthy of Thy Heart? Where shall this worthless World produce him? And by the generous Arcas too, my Patron, Is this high Task impos'd! What Power can save thee? Must I, if true to Love, be false to him? Or true to Arcas, must I lose Pastora? Nay, what would Falshood, if pursued, avail? 'Twere terrible, tho' guiltless, to avow my Love! To meet her Scorn (for Scorn must sure attend it!) Were sharper Pain, if possible, than to Behold her, happy, in a Rival's Arms; Which Way soe'er I turn, Despair surrounds me! Like the poor Pilot, while his Vessel burns, I pause, to perish in the Flames, or Waves! AIR XIX. Was ever, than mine, a Fate more severe; To perish in Silence, or dye by Despair? Despairing, I languish a Lover conceal'd, Yet the Cause of my Anguish gives Death, if reveal'd: While her Birth is so high, my Fortune so low, By her Frown I must dye, if I tell her my Woe. Was ever, than mine, a Fate more severe; To perish in Silence, or dye by Despair? [Exit. Enter Pastora. Past. Sure, 'twas Amyntas' Voice, and Love that tun'd it. A Sound ill-boding to the lost Pastora! I fear some Nymph unknown has seiz'd his Heart. It must be so! all but too well agrees With what my Father, knowing, has injoyn'd. Yet why is Mine this Task? He could not, sure, Suppose Amyntas sigh'd for me! Ah, no, He would not then have sent me to relieve him! For often has he warn'd me to regard My Birth, and shun the humbler Swains beneath me: Which, to this Hour, I have observ'd, with Sorrow. How far this sweet Occasion, to reveal My Pain, I may resistâI dare not think on! Yet sure no Pain exceeds conceal'd Desire. AIR XX. While Groves alone hear me complain, Like the Lilly, when drooping I pine, If silent, I languish in Pain, How can his Heart ever be mine? O Cupid! asswage what I feel, Since my Fault is but loving too well: O! let my Distress to conceal, Be less than the Pain is to tell. Amyntas returns. Am. Thus, while the warbling Philomel complains, The list'ning Swain partakes her tuneful Sorrow. Past. My Griefs, Amyntas, sympathize with thine. Thy plaintive Strains have given my pensive Heart Distress unfelt beforeâ Am. âAre then our Griefs So equally severe, as to deserve Our mutual Pity? Sure a social Balm, So sweetly healing, might asswage the Pain. Past. Or may increase it, from the Cause mistaken. Am. Why are those Causes then conceal'd, since on Our Cure, our future Happiness depends? Past. That Question, Thou, Amyntas, must resolve! For, to that Purpose, has my Father sent me, To search thy Griefs, and by Advice to heal them. Am. The same Injunction has he laid on me, That I should give due Praises, to thy easy Scorn Of vain Philautus' Love, and to thy Heart Commend a Swain, whose Virtues might deserve thee. But say, Pastora, did he tell thee, that He knew, Amyntas lov'd? Past. âThy Strains confess'd t. Am. If that were Proof, thy Strains confess'd the same. Past. We often sing of Sorrows not our own. Am. Of such, Pastora, might Amyntas sing. Past. May we then hope, that neither of us love? Am. If both could love with Hope, 'twere happier still! Past. But that, alas! for ever is deny'd to me! Compell'd by frowning Honour to despair! Am. The same stern Brow affrights Amyntas' Hope. Past. Do'st thou then love below thy Birth, Amyntas? Am Were that my Fate, I might declare my Flame. But Fears like mine can never reach Pastora: For, in Arcadia, she has no Superior. Past. And therefore is she doom'd to hide her Heart. Am. O Love! how equal are our Woes, and yet How opposite their Cause? Past. âOur woes so like, May in the same complaining Strains be told. AIR XXI. Tho' my Grief is severe, it relieves me, to see, That the Swain who inflicts it, conceives not'tis He. The Swain that subdues me, I dare not reveal; That I'm won e'er he woes me, I tremble to tell: Tho' my Ruin it prove, no Weakness I'll show; 'Tis enough, that I love, and too much he should know; Tho' my Grief is severe, it relieves me, to see, That the Swain who inflicts it, conceives not 'tis He. Am. And yet Pastora, sure, might trust a Friend, A friend appointed to receive the Secret! Past. Is not my Charge the same on thee, Amyntas? Am. What Evil can attend thy first declaring? Past. 'Till I first know Amyntas' Heart, my Flame For ever stifled, in my Breast shall dye. AIR XXII. Am. Cupid, help a Swain's Despair! Teach his Tongue to lose his Fear! Past. Cupid grant the Swain I love, May for Me my Anguish prove! Am. Must I drag this hopeless Chain? Past. Must I ever sigh in vain? Both. Love conceal'd in endless Pain! Am. Cupid, help a Swain's Despair! Past. Cure my Love, or kill my Fear! Both. Grant, O! grant, the Nymph/Swain I love, May for Me my Anguish prove. Past. Amyntas, as thou would'st preserve my Peace, Tell me the Nymph, that gives Me Pains for Thee. Am. How dreadful is the Precipice I stand on! But yet remember, O! too curious Maid! When I lye dash'd, and dead with my Despair, 'Twas not my own Presumption, but thy Will That forc'd me on my Fate! and to confess, My tortur'd Heartâhas long ador'd Pastora! Past. What have I heard, Amyntas?â Am. âO cruel Maid! Why wouldst thou drive me to this dreadful Fall? Past. That these kind Arms might save thee. O Amyntas! Our Happiness, our Ruin, from this Hour, Is one! And if Pastora's yielded Heart Can pay the Pains thou hast endur'd for me, Let thy own Wishes form thy own Reward! The Joys I give Amyntas, I receive. Am. Immortal Pow'rs! may I believe my Sense? What hast thou utter'd? O Pastora! sure I dream! This heavenly Vision is too much For waking Life to bear! Amazement, Love, Tumultuous Joy, and Transport, swell my Heart, I fear, beyond the limits of my poor Deservings. Past. No, Amyntas! That sweet Humility, Thy distant Awe of unavow'd Desire, Has more prevail'd upon my yielding Heart, Than all the Flatteries of protesting Love. Am. O! let me gaze, and languish on thy Softness! While Sighs on Sighs invoke thy Charms confess'd, And fault'ring Speech can only sound Pastora. Learn hence, ye Nymphs, your Lovers to surprize, Nor boast the trivial Conquest of your Eyes: The Vows your Charms inspire, with Charms will break, And teach the sated Lover to forsake: But when, with Virtue aided, you subdue, Long will your Swains adore, and long be true! Then, like Pastora's, may your Flames be own'd, And each Amyntas in your Hearts be Crown'd. The End of the Second Act.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Arcas and Ãgon in the Garden. Arcas. Yes, Ãgon, I o'er-heard it all! Conceal'd Within a Bower, which scarce the Sun or Winds Could pierce, my Ears were witness of their Love; I heard the equal Conflict of their Hearts, Which, while unknowing that their Flames were mutual, Alternate Duty labour'd to conceal: Such Innocence and Virtue gave me Pain, To see the dread Suspence of their Desires! But when, to their Amazement, they discover'd, How long, in Heart, for Heart, their Hopes had languish'd, Their tender Transports even recall'd my Youth, And gave my Eyes the Softness of a Lover. Ãg. Here, we perceive how Blood sustains the Mind. Pastora's humble Passions with her Birth subside, Her Heart is charm'd by Merit, in its Weeds; While cold Ianthe, unsubdu'd by Fortune, Maintains the Native Station of her Race, Nor bends her Merit to superior Birth. Arc. Her Coldness shews, at least, the honest Pride Of Virtue knows its Worth, and will be woed. Ãg. Thus Iphis too, unheedful of her Fortune, Shews he thinks Virtue is the noblest Dower. Arc. All, all, my Friend, advances to our Wishes; And let me say the Merit of their Love Were lost, had not these Tryals prov'd their Virtue! And yetâthe strongest, Ãgon, is to come, The long-hid Secret of their Birth! How that Discover'd may affect their Constancyâ Ãg. My Lord, you nourish Fears, which I alone Should feel; If alter'd Birth could change their Passions, Yours might, indeed, despise the Race of Ãgon. Lost Iphis and Pastora may be wretched; Amyntas and Ianthe chuse their Fate. Arc. But dost thou think, their Hearts will still be firm? Ãg. Suspicion cannot form a Fear against them! Or if, at most, I grant, Ianthe may A while, for Form, retard the Hopes of Iphis, That's the worst Consequence that can befall us. Arc. Thy sanguine Temper, Ãgon, always cheers me! Be Iphis then our next immediate Care. Is he yet Master of Ianthe's Riddle? Ãg. That's my least Thought! meer female Shyness, To give her feign'd Resentment time to cool; And save th'Appearance of offended Virtue. Arc. Where is Ianthe now?â Ãg. âIn yonder Grove I left her, skilfully collecting Herbs Of sanative and virtual Power, which she In Charity sometimes administers To helpless Swains, when Sickness, or Mischance, Confines them to their Cotts, unfit for Labour. But where has Iphis pass'd his lonely Hours? Arc. This Morn, I was inform'd, he had been seen Before the Dawn, upon the southern Cliff Whose lofty Head looks down upon the Sea: There pensive, and alone, in studious plight, He lay, and warn'd the passing Swains to leave him. Ãg. Love, and the Riddle, give him full Employment. Arc. Perhaps too much: I, therefore, have sent forth Old Corydon, with others, to observe His Purposes, and warn him homewardâSee! Already he's return'dâNow, Corydon, Enter Corydon. What News of Iphis? hast thou found him? Cor. âFound him! Ay, my good Lord, he's found; but I much fear, He has lost himselfâOh! he has blown me bravely! Arc. Explain! be brief, good Corydonâ Cor. âNay, nay, I have not Breath to make long-winded Speeches. Ãg. Speak, Manâ Cor. âWhy then, in shortâsince short's my Breath, He's mad. Ãg. âMad!â Arc. âWhat mean'st thouâ Cor. âEven as I say: He's not himself, that's certain: for his Wits Have neither Sense, nor Purpose! all his Talk Is like a broken Instrument, untun'd; Notes without Harmony.â Arc. âWhere was he found? Cor. Beneath the Hill, where you directed us, Runs a small Brook, that winds along the Vale: There he sat weaving simple Wreaths of Willow; One, on his Brow, he wore: at sight of us, He made dumb Signs, that we should sit beside him. We did so; and not a Word was said to cross him: (For by his Eyes we saw, his Head was wrong.) Then he gave Garlands round to every Swain; And sigh'd, and heav'd, as if his Heart were bursting! Anon he drew some Papers from his Scrip; On which he por'd, and purs'd his studious Brow! Then gave out Copies of the same, and cry'd, Read! read! Expound, and be an Oracle! Arc. The Riddle, Ãgonâ Cor. âAy, a Riddle penn'd In Verse, but past our Skill (poor Souls) t'untye! And then he laugh'd and sung light Madrigalls, And talk'd so many mournful moving Things, He drew my Heart into my Eyes, tho' scarce A Word, of what he utter'd, was Intelligible. Yonder he comes, and all the Swains about him. Arc. Ãgon! this Sight for ever will reproach us. Enter Iphis musing on a Paper, follow'd by Cimon, Mopsus, and other Shepherds all crown'd with Willow. Iph. 'Tis done! I've found it!â'tis the Rainbow! Pour, Pour down, ye pitying Clouds, your gentle Showers, While, with his radiant Pencil, PhÅbus paints The glorious Arch, upon your gaudy Bosom! Cor. Look you there nowâyou see I told you true. Arc. I see it, and with Sorrowâgive him way. Iph. O heav'nly Sight! Happy auspicious Omen! It comes! it forms! delightful to the Eye! Behold where mounted Iris sits aloft, And offers me a Seat upon her Throne! See! see! above her Head, Ianthe fixt, Like a bright Evening Star, with Beams unborrow'd,, Adorns the Sky, and calls for Adoration! Dost thou not see herâthereâ [To Corydon. Cor. âNot I, in troth! Iph. Why there! look there! the Moon turns pale at her! Cor. Yes, yes, the Moon is pale indeed!âalas! Poor Soul, his Words are like a Ditty in A Foreign Tongue to meâMusick without Meaning. Iph. Now let us catch the Rainbow, and demand her From the Skiesâah! me! she frowns! she flies me! Down! down! ye gentle Virgins, and assist A Swain's Despair! melt her obdurate Heart, And bend the Goddess to a human Pity! AIR I. O gentle Orpheus! tune Harmonious To my Song, thy Lyre! Kneeling.] Teach me, Goddess! to adore thee! Help a Lover void of Art. Let his streaming Tears implore thee, To relieve a bleeding Heart. O remit thy dreadful Sentence On a Crime, that call'd thee Fair! If that Sin requires Repentance, Death is kinder than Despair. If, for Love, my Doom is dying, Tender Pity let me crave; If a Tear should fall complying, Gently drop it on my Grave. [He sinks into the Arms of Arcas. Arc. O piteous Youth! O Ãgon! where is now Our Foresight? Our Paternal Care? Our Hope? All lost, and ruin'd by too refin'd a Prudence! Ãg. Do not think so! this Malady may pass, And Iphis yet recover to our Comfort. Arc. 'Tis now no time to hesitate on Forms. When Life's in doubt, Extreams must be apply'd; Ianthe must be found; on her alone Depends the Ruin, or Relief, of Iphis. Ãg. While you, Sir, lead him to Repose, Myself and these our Friends will search the Groves, And bring her, with relenting Tears to save him. [Exit Ãg. with others. Arc. Ha! he revives! assist me, Corydon! [They raise him. Iph. Ianthe! where! O my deluded Sense! She's fled! she's lost! the mould'ring Clouds disperse, And the gay liquid Phantome is no more! Such are the Visionary Smiles of Woman! A Silver Mornâa Showerâa transient Sun! A driving Stormâa Tempest of Despair. [Exeunt Arc. and Cor. leading Iphis. The SCENE changes to a Grove. Enter Ianthe with a Servant, bearing the Greens, &amp;c. they have been gathering. Ian. These, Cloe, may suffice for present use; Now hye thee Home, and sort them as directed. I shall but rest a while, and follow thee. [Ex. Servant. At length, I am alone, and my free Thoughts, Uncensur'd now, may send a Sigh to Iphis. Yes, lovely Youth, with Sorrow I conceive Thy Pains for me; yet thine give thee no View Of those, Ianthe on her self imposes! For sure, to bear Disdain unmerited, Is less Compunction to the generous Mind, Than to disguise, with Scorn, a yielding Heart. Thy Pains, tho' grievous, yet implore Relief Even of the Wretch, that wants the Beggar's Pity. AIR II. No more, ye happy Swains, upbraid, Or of our Sexes Scorn complain; One Conflict of the Love-sick Maid, Is far, than yours, severer Pain! The Wounds we give, your Tongues may tell, No Self-Reproach attends the Shame; But Oh! what Torture must we feel, Who Burn, and yet conceal the Flame? But soft! some Swain advances through the Grove: The waving Boughs so break upon the View, I scarce discernâit is not Iphisânoâ This is some Strangerâby his stately Port, It must be the great Corinthian Courtier, The new-appointed Lover of Pastora! What can have drawn him hither, thus alone! But be his Purpose as it may, it must Be mine t'avoid his Sightâbut whereâor how? This way I meet himâhereâbehind these Alders Conceal'd a while, perhaps he may o'erpass me. [Retires. Enter Philautus. Phil. This way the sorrow-sounding Voice directed: It I can be only she, the sad Pastora! Soothing with Melody her fond Desire! I knew her Female Coyness was too faint, To breathe intended Scornâmy amorous Arrows, When ever drawn, are punctual to the Mark! The gentle Fondling!âhow her Sighs inchant me! Methinks I see her, on some flow'ry Bank Repos'd, and languishing with Love conceal'd! Her lilly Hand supports her pensive Head, Her drooping Eyes, as conscious of my Conquest, Refuse the Light, that gazes on her Shame! Now with Desire her downy Bosom heaves, While Sighs diffused embalm the ambient Air. And yet I see her notâshe cannot far Be henceâperhaps a soft condoling Strain May raise her from her Woes, to wakeful Joy. AIR III. Lovely Turtle! once more Cooe! Call thy Mate, and find him true! Gently murmur, to my Ear! Tell me, Charmer, Tell! Oh! tell me, where Love may find, and kill thy Care. O call me! With thy mournful Strains allure, Cooe, and call me to thy Cure. O call me! Cooe, and call me, Cooe, and call me To thy Cure. Call me to thy Cure. And yet she answers not! where? where, Pastora? It must be soâHer conscious Solitude, At my Approach, collects her Virgin Blushes, And Love lies silent, fearful to encounter! Now Fortune guide meâHa! transporting Vision! She's found! she's found!â Ianthe comes forward. Ian. âSir, I am not Pastora. Phil. By all my Hopes, a Beauty far more charming. Ian. If you would find Pastora, Sir, from hence A Bow-shot westward, lies a Rivulet; There with my Brother, in the flow'ry Mead, I left her listning to his Melody. Phil. And who, fair Nymph, may be the happy Swain, That calls thee Sister?â Ian. âSir, the Son of Ãgon, Young Amyntasâ Phil. âIs Ãgon, then, thy Father? Ian. That I'm his Daughter, is my Happiness. Phil. And what too cruel Care, my lovely Maid, Has drawn thee to this Solitude? For by Thy Plaintive Song, I know thou art unhappy. Ian. My slight Sorrows are of my own creating. Phil. Can Love, in all his Tyranny, find Cause Of Sorrow, for such blooming Beauty? Say What sullen Swain, insensible of Joy, Has wrong'd thy Innocence: If Love's thy Grief; Behold this Champion-Arm, this kinder Heart, Prompt to revenge, or to relieve thy Wishes. Ian. Your generous Offers, Sir, are lost on me. I have no Thoughts like those to gratify: Permit me to retireâThis fruitless Talk Intrudes upon those Hours you owe Pastora. This way directs youâ Phil. Yet, you must not pass. These amorous Shades, my Fair, were form'd for Love! And soft Desire, resistless as thy Charms, Compells me, thus, to seize the fair Occasion! Ian. If you are Noble, as Appearance speaks you, You can't but know these guilty Sounds Are Insult to a helpless Maiden's Ear. But Now, you offer'd to revenge my Wrongs: Make good your Word, and be your own Reprover; Revenge upon your self, what Innocence O'erborn, wants Strength, to punish, or avoid. Phil. Can Love be Insult, when so gently offer'd? Ian. Constraint, and Gentleness, but I'll agree: If you are gentle, you'll permit me pass, And free my Virtue from a needless Terror. AIR IV. Phil. Why so cold, so coy, my Fair? Ian. Nature teaches Maids their Fear. Phil. Tender Love thy Fears shall chace. Ian. Name not Loveâ Phil. One soft Embrace! Ian. No, no, no! you press my Heart in vain: Can you be pleas'd, while you give me Pain? Phil. Yet hear meânay, weep notâ Ian. O Sir, you are born above me! Phil. Pretty Maid, I'll make thee great. Ian. Leave me to my lowly Fate. Phil. What can move you? Pretty Maid, I'll make thee great. Ian. Leave me to my lowly Fate, If you Love me! Phi. (Apart ...) By Heav'n, a Beauty even of Nature's forming! If Gold, or Golden Promises can woe, From hence, to Corinth, will I tempt her Virtue, And leave Pastora to repent her Coyness. (... Apart) Why, my fair Virgin, thus o'ercast with Sorrow? Look up, and meet thy Happiness in Smiles! In me, kind Fortune waits upon thy Wishes: To raise thee from these humble Plains, to Affluence, To Pomp, to Pleasures, and luxurious Life! Ian. AIR V. Bright Gold may be too dearly bought: Ah! then how vain the Show! Content and Virtue be my Lot, Tho' ne'er so low. Phi. Mistaken Maid, thy rural Life obscur'd Has shewn thee nothing of the greater World! Our Palaces have Joys unknown to Groves! One circling Round of Splendor and Delight Fills up the dalliant Measure of our Hours! The menial Sun himself attends our Pleasures. With bright Meridian Beams begins our Morn; And when, with Night, our dusky Noon comes on, Tapers resplendent blaze another Day! Till sated with the various Midnight Revel, Uprising PhÅbus lights us to Repose! Then folded in the happy Lover's Arms, Each Amorous Dame hides from excluded Light Her glowing Blushes, 'till the Noon-tide Morn. Such are the Joys, fair Nymph, reserv'd for thee. Fly then these abject Plains, and seize thy Fortune. Ian. What shall I say? how answer, or avoid him? [Aside. Phil. Think well, my Fair, who, and what Grandeur courts thee. Ian. (Aside) To tell him how my Heart detests his Love, May irritate his Pride, to Insolence! Better to tempt his Pity, than his Anger. Phil. Hast thou no Heart, or is it form'd of Marble? Ian. AIR VI. My simple Heart is fled away, Nor was it made of Stone: You come too late, alas the Day! Too late by One. Phil. What bold presuming Swain shall dare To stand the Rival of my Flames avow'd? Away; this artful Story is but feign'd, To stir my yielding Heart to Jealousy, That with a softer Fondness it may woe thee? Ian. AIR VII. Alas! I own, with weeping Eye, Your softest Vows are vain! The more you sigh, the more must I In Tears complain. Phil. Impossible! thou dost not know thy Heart! To fly, and tell me,'tis thy Grief to fly, Implies thy fearful Withes would relieve me, Could I but find Excuses for thy Kindness: Here then, behold them, sparkling as thy Eyes! [Offering Jewels. While these, my Fair, adorn thy radiant Charms, Reproach will, cringing, gratulate thy Fortune; And envious Censure rival thy Desires. AIR VIII. Fly, fond Nymph, these Rural Plains; Thou wert born, in Courts to shine: Waste not then thy Charms on Swains, To a nobler Love incline. Ian. AIR IX. In Pity, O! my Pain relieve! Nor press a Heart, not mine, to give! Should I, for you, inconstant prove, Too soon might Scorn succeed your Love. How could you bear a Maid untrue? Whose wavering Heart From Truth must part, And first be false, ere kind to you? Phil. Has Cupid, then, no Sway among your Plains? Or, are you all to Vestal Flames devoted, That Dignity and Merit thus are slighted! Shall I return to Corinth a rejected Lover; Without one ruin'd Heart to mourn my Parting? Have I, in Courts, been sated with Success, And, here, must, like a low-born Shepherd, pine, In want of what were honour'd by Acceptance? Ian. O! then be conscious of your Worth, and scorn me! Phil. No, froward Maid; I know your Sexes Wiles! These painted Terrors would excite Compassion, And sooth my Fervour, into lingring Hope; But I'll cut short those cold Formalities Of Love, and force thee to immediate Joy. Ian. What mean you, Sir?â Phil. âTo give you, what your Pride And Coyness, in your warmest Hours, expect; The kind Excuse of Violence, to hide Your Blushes, in a feign'd Resistanceâ Ian. âHelp! Ye guardian Powers of Innocence, protect me! [Iphis rushes in, presenting his Spear to Philantus. Iph. Hold! Ravisher! forego the frighted Maid, Or, to thy Traytor's Heart, receive my Vengeance! Phil. Confusion! am I by a Stripling brav'd? Ian. Hold, Iphis, I conjure thee! O! expose not, To his unequal Strength, thy precious Life! Since his foul Purpose is prevented, leave To the avenging Gods his Punishment. Iph. The Gods by me demand itâ Phil. âHold! rash Boy! Thou art some sighing Lover, whom her Scorn, Perhaps, has held a Vassal to her Pride: As such, I give thy Fate CompassionâThere! Take, and deserve her, by thy seeming Service! If, after, what these conscious Groves may tell thee, I have possess'd, thy gross, contented Heart Can feast on thy Superior's Waste of Riot; Enjoy thy Wish, and rid me of Satiety! Iph. Thou lyest, infernal Traytorâ Phil. âHa! so brave! Iph. More impotent in Malice, than Pretention! Her spotless Fame defies thy sland'rous Tongue I heard her shrieking in thy horrid Gripe! I saw Aversion sparkling from her Eyes, And pale Abhorrence shuddering at thy Touch, As if some writhing Serpent had embrac'd her. Phil. 'Tis well, fond Youth! then be it so! she still Is chasteâMe she avoidedâright! believe so! I only boasted, to insult thy Love! Her Virtue still reserves her Heart for thee! Iph. Insinuating Slave! wouldst thou, to gain Belief, confess thy self a Villain? No! That she reserves, for me, her Heart, requires Almost thy Vanity to hope: But this I know; Whoever may deserve her Favour, Thy Ruffian Insult, on her Sex and Fame, Deserve my Boar-Spear quivering in thy Heart. But Cowardice, like thine, would shame Resentment; To kill thee, were to hide thy Infamy! To let thee live abhorr'd, is nobler Vengeance! Phil. Bold Minion! thou shalt hear of this severely! Iph. Away! thou Vaunter of thy own Dishonour! Hence! with thy Safety! let my Scorn forget thee! Phil. Such Insolenceâno Temper can support. [Ex. Phil. Iph. O fair Ianthe! do I once more meet Thy Eyes, and unoffended, at my gazing? Ian. That I have Eyes to see, or Tongue to speak, Is owing, Iphis, to thy timely Virtue! Had not thy Arm, from worse than Death, preserv'd me, Ianthe had, ere this, been seen no more! Even yet, I tremble at the Instant Horror! And scarce have Life to breathe my Gratitude O Iphis, how! how shall my Heart repay thee? Iph. Be but, to thy own Injunction, constant, Comply with what thy Vows have sworn, And make thy Iphis blest, by Heaven's Decree. Ian. What means thy Transport?â Iph. âMark! mark well thy Words! âWhen Iphis plain this Riddle reads, âThen, to his Wish, his Love succeeds! Ian. Hast thou then solv'd it, Iphis?â Iph. âHear my Fortune. Ian. My Hopes, my Heart attends theeâ Iph. âO, Ianthe! Were I to tell thee, how my tortur'd Brain Had labour'd, ev'n to Madness, for the Sense Of thy obscure Decree upon my Love, Thy Tenderness would pity my Despair. Ian. As Iphis would the Sorrows of Ianthe, Had he conceiv'd their Causeâ Iph. âSaidst thou, their Cause! Ian. Nay, those are Thoughts for future Hoursâproceed. Iph. Let it suffice then, that my Father's Care Soon brought my wandring Senses to Reflection. When hopeless still, and, to my Fate resign'd, Like thee, to chaste Diana's Shrine I flew, Imploring Succour to my Heart's Distress. When, from her awful Tripos, thus the Goddess, Inverting her Decree, explain'd my Fate. âThat which she cannot Have, the Fair shall Give. âThat which thou canst not Give, or she Desire. âThat which she must not have, shalt thou receive. âThat, that's the Cure thy present Woes require. Ian. Haste to expound, and ease my Heart's Impatience. Iph. âO then repay my Woes, with happier Life. âAnd give me what Thou Canst not haveâa Wife: âAnd in Return, which thou canst never Give, âIanthe's Heart a Husband shall receive! Ian. O never was a Heart so justly given! This, Iphis, is a Marriage made by Heaven! Canst thou forget my Sexes coy Regard? Iph. Can Love look back from such a sweet Reward? The fond and easy Maid is kind in vain; Faint is the Bliss, that never past thro' Pain. Beauty, by Nature, timorously coy, By Griefs impos'd, refines the Lover's Joy: Thus blooming Roses have their native Power, To wound the Hand that pulls the fragrant Flower. [Exeunt. Damon Enters alone. Dam. How! Iphis, and Ianthe, hand in hand? 'Twas but this Hour, I heard he had lost his Wits For Love! Nay, Ãgon now is in the Woods Seeking his Daughter tooâAh! ha! my Mistress! You've found yourself, it seems, the way to cure him! Your dainty Coyness is come down at last, And Love, on second Thoughts, is not so frightful! But why do I pretend to laugh at her, When Phillida has made a greater Fool of me, Than ever held the Sexes Power in Scorn? Dam. AIR X. Around the Plains, my Heart has rov'd: The Brown, the Fair, my Flames approv'd: The Pert, the Proud, by Turns have lov'd; And kindly fill'd my Arms. I danc'd, I sung, I talk'd, I toy'd; While This I woo'd, I That enjoy'd, And ere the Kind, with Kindness cloy'd, The Coy resign'd her Charms. But now, alas! those Days are done: The Wrong'd are all reveng'd, by One, Who, like a frighted Bird, is flown, Yet leaves her Image here. O! could I, yet, her Heart recal, Before her Feet my Pride would fall, And, for her Sake, forsaking all, Would fix for ever there. Could I have ever thought to have seen this Day! That I should fold my Arms, and sigh for One? Nay One that in her Turn has sigh'd for me! And only could subdue me by her Parting! How could the Gypsy muster such a Spirit? The Pertness of her Pride has so provok'd me, I shall never rest in my Bed, 'till she Lies by meâHere she comes, and with herâhaâ Her Father! softâI'm out of Favour there! Lie close a while, and mark what Nail's a driving. [Retires. Enter Corydon, with Phillida. Cor. And I say, think no more of himâ Phil. âThat's hard! Is't not enough I see him not? Cor. âI say, Avoid him, as the wildest Beast of Prey! He uses Girls like Carrion: Not the Wolf In a Sheepfold, or hungry Fox on Poultry, Can make more Havock, than that wicked Rogue Among the Wenches Heartsâ Dam. âThat must be me! [Behind. But what says Phillida? Phil. âSuppose this true! Yet could he, still, be wrought to marry me! Cor. My Patience! has he not refus'd to marry? Phil. And therefore I have declar'd against his Love. Cor. Ay, ay, but still he lurks within your Heart! And 'till you drive him thenceâ Phil. âI strive to do it; And if you knew the Pain, you'd pity me. AIR XI. A thousand Ways, to wean my Heart, I've try'd, yet can't remove him. And tho' for Life, I've sworn to part, For Life, I find I love him. Still should the dear false Man return, And with new Vows pursue me, His flatt'ring Tongue would kill my Scorn, And still, I fear, undo me. Cor. Consider, Philly, if thou'rt fairly married, (And thou hast choice of Cimon, or of Mopsus.) How happy will thy double Dowry make thee? Phil. I do consider, Father; so should you! As a low Fortune with the Man, I love, Can't make me rich; so Riches with the Man I hate, can't make me happyâ Dam. (Behind) âGallant Girl! O! I could eat thy very Lips, that spoke it. Cor. See! yonder's Cimon coming! For my Sake, Dear Phillida, give him at least a Smile; A little Love endur'd, may teach the Boy, In time, to please theeâ Phil. âWell! since you desire it. But Mopsus has the same Pretensions too. Send him to make his equal Claim, And, 'till he's found, I'll hear what Cimon says. Cor. Ah! Phillida, thou gain'st my Heart, I'll send him. [Ex. Dam. Now shall I measure, by their Hopes, my own. To her Cimon singing. AIR XII. Cim. Behold, and see thy wounded Lover! Whose Truth from thee will ne'er depart! O let my Tears, at length, discover One gentle Smile, to heal my Heart! Phil. Were in the World, no Man but Cimon, None of the Female Kind but I, With me should end the Name of Woman, With Thee the Race of Man should die. Cim. O cruel Sound! false-hearted Phillida! Didst thou not say, thou loved'st me better than My Brother Mopsus?â Phil. âYes, but 'twas, As of two Evils, I would chuse the least; Stay, till I'm bound to chuse, and then reproach me. Thy Crying makes me laugh, his Laughing makes Me sleepâThere's all the hopeful difference. Cim. AIR XIII. O what a Plague is Love! I cannot bear it: What Life so curst can prove, Or Pain come near it! When I would tell my Mind, My Heart misdoubts me; Or when I speak, I find With Scorn she routs me. In vain is all I say. Her Answer still is Nay: O dismal, doleful Day! Phillida flouts me. Enter Mopsus singing. AIR XIV. Mop. Ah! poor Cimon! Dud a cry? Well-a-day! wipe an Eye! O fy, Phillida! To treat him so scornfully, Shamefully, mournfully! Phillida, fy! Phil. No, no, no, Sir Pert, and Dull! Simpleton, Paperskull! I for ever shall Think thee far the greater Fool; Therefore will give thee Cause With him to cry. Cim. Toll! loll! loll! doll!âNow I pray, Who has Cause most to cry, ah! well-a-day? Mop. What care I! why let her scoff, I can laugh; play her off, better than you. Cim. Ah! poor Mopsus, thou'rt a Fool! Mop. I say, you're a greater Owl. Cim. Nay, now I'm sure that's a Lye. Mop. What's a Lye?â Cim. âThat's a Lye! Mop. I say, 'tis true. AIR XV. [The AIR changes.] Phil. Give over your Love, you great Loobies, I hate you both, you Sir, and you too: Did ever a brace of such Boobies The Lass, that detests them, pursue? Mop. How!â Phil. âGoe!â Cim. âOh! I'm ready to faint! How are you? [To Mopsus. Mop. Why truly, she treats us but so, so. For my part, I think she's a Devil. A Woman would scorn for to do so. Cim. O Fy! fy! such Words are uncivil. Phil. Prepare then, to hear my last Sentence. Before I'd wed either, much rather I'd stand on the Stool of Repentance, And want for my Bantling a Father. Goe!â Cim. âOh! Woe! I'm ready to faint; Mop. And I too. Was ever a Slut so inhuman! Odszooks! let us take down her Mettle! Cim. I dare notâ Mop. âLet me come! pshaw waw, Man. She only has water'd a Nettle. In short, this won't do, Mrs. Vixen! For One of us Two you must now chuse. Phil. Then you are the Man that I fix on; And Youâare the Fool I refuse. [Strikes each a Box on the Ear. Cim. Waunds! Cim. and Mop. Go! The Devil would fly such a Spouse. Phil. If there's a Joy comes near recovering those We love, sure 'tis to silence those we hate. When Cimon and Mopsus are gone, Damon presents himself to Phillida, singing. AIR XVI. Dam. See! behold, and see! With an Eye kind, and relenting, Damon, now, repenting, Only true to thee; Content to love, and love for Life! Phil. If you, now sincere, honest Declaration Mean to prove your Passion, To the Purpose swear, And make, at once, a Maid a Wife. Dam. Thus, for Life, I take thee, Never to forsake thee. Soon, or late, I find our Fate, To Hearts astray, Directs the Way, And brings, to lasting Joys, the Rover home. Phil. Ever kind, and tender, Conquer'd, I surrender: Prove but true, As I, to you, Each kindling Kiss Shall yield a Bliss, That only, from the constant Lip, can come. AIR XVII. Dam. To the Priest away, to bind our Vows, With our Hands, and Hearts united. Phil. To reduce the Rover, to lawful Spouse, Is a Triumph, my Heart has delighted. Dam. If I never could fix, 'Twas the Fault of the Sex, Who easily yielding, were easy, to cloy. Both. But in Love we still find, When the Heart's well inclin'd, In One, only One, is the Joy. But in Love, &amp;c. The SCENE opens to the House of Arcas. Arcas and Ãgon come forward, and at some Distance stand Iphis with Ianthe, and Amyntas with Pastora. Ãg. Now, Sir, applaud my Foresight, and confess, That what I promis'd has not fail'd our Hopes. Amyntas and Pastora own their Love; And Iphis has at length deserv'd Ianthe. Arc. Yes, Ãgon, now I see the secret Care Of Providence, that forms our Happiness, By Measures unforeseen to human Eyes. Had not Philautus prov'd an impious Ruffian, Iphis might never have produc'd his Virtue. Nor fair Pastora, but by Scorn of him, Have shewn a Spirit worthy of her Birth. But where shall my Indulgence find Excuse, To ratifie thy Flame profess'd, Amyntas? Or thine, Ianthe, for the Son of Arcas? How may I answer, to the World, my Conduct, In mixing such unequal Blood, and Fortune? Am. My Lord, if private Happiness must rank With what is practis'd in the sensual World, My Hopes are blasted; and I stand condemn'd, Even by my own Confession, of a Crime Might lay an Imputation on your Pardon. But if (as I have often heard you say) Man only has his Value, from his Virtue, And that where Food and Rayment are provided, Health, and Integrity of Heart, is all That's needful to compleat our Happiness: Then, Sir, my pleading Love has this Excuse; That tho', beyond a Life of Innocence, I boast no Virtues, to support my Claim; Yet by your own Prescription, I may say Pastora chose me; therefore I deserve her. Ãg. An Answer worthy of thy Father's Son! Fear not, Amyntas, I'll support thy Love. Arc. Ãgon! Thou more than Father to my Boy! [Aside to Ãgon. 'Tis well, Amyntas: When Ianthe has Reply'd, at once, on Both, I shall determine. Ian. My noble Lord! the Time has been, when you Yourself reproach'd my cold Regard of Iphis; And, like a tender Father, gave him to my Pity. Was it no Merit, that my bleeding Heart Refus'd to gratifie its own Desires, And starv'd my Love, to feed a just Resentment? If that Resentment, since, has been appeas'd By Obligations, greater, than even Life Preserv'd, can you reproach my Gratitude? If then a Heart, so tempted, seems aspiring, Let this Reflection, Sir, excuse my Love; That Iphis, tho' adorn'd with every Grace That might deserve, and charm the proudest Beauty; Though my Superior far, in high-born Blood; And of a Fortune boundless, as your Bounty; Yet all these Gifts, from Heaven, and Nature's Hand, Were Charms too weak, to reach Ianthe's Heart, Till Truth, and Love, had more than once deserv'd her. Arc. O! Ãgon! Ãgon! my Contentment grows Too strong, to be conceal'd! I thirst, I burn To clasp my blessed Children in my Arms, And pour out all the Fondness of a Father. Am. Whence this affecting Passion? Ãg. From a Cause Will raise you Wonder equal to your Virtues. Nor, from the sweet Rewards he now intends Your Love, can spring a Transport more sublime, Than what a tender Father feels, to find His Children have deserv'd themâ Am. âHa! Ian. âHis Children! Ãg. What then remains, my Lord, but that you call Their Merit, from obscure Adoption, forth, And let Amyntas, and Ianthe know, What noble Blood now claims, and crowns their Virtues. Arc. Hear then, ye happy Lovers, and attend The Story of your strange inverted Fortunes. You often have been told that Ãgon, and Myself, whose Friendship from our Youth grew up, In one same Year (such was the Will of Heaven) Buried the Bosom-Partners of our Hearts. Our mutual Grief soon drew us from the gay And tasteless Pleasures of a Court, to pass In rural Solitude our future Days, Accountable to Sense, and Nature's Law. It happen'd, in our Course of friendly Talk, One Day reflecting on the anxious Cares That tender Parents feel, for Infant Children; Observing too, how seldom high-born Blood And Riches add to real Happiness; How often head-strong Youth, depending on Hereditary Rank, have sunk their Virtues in Excess, and from elated Pride, have mock'd Those Morals, that should grace Nobility: Those Fears, I say, revolving in my Breast, To Ãgon I propos'd this strange Precaution: That mutually our Infants should exchange Their Father; and having no Mother's Fondness, That might oppose our Scheme, we thence agreed That thou Amyntas, and Ianthe thou, As Ãgon's Son and Daughter should be train'd; That, to your seeming humble Birth and Fortune, Your Hopes restrain'd, might level your Desires; While Iphis, and Pastora, to my Care Assign'd, might, from imaginary Birth, Imbibe the higher Sentiments of Honour. Now mark! how happily the Consequence Succeeds!âlet your Amazement still be mute, While my paternal Care prevents your Wishes, And doles you out the Blessings you deserve. Ãg. Now, Children, form your Wishes, and receive them. Arc. Amyntas, to reward his Love conceal'd, Now enters on a Fortune, which expected Had lost the sweeter Relish of Possession: And to exert his Gratitude to Ãgon, Whose Precepts taught him to deserve Pastora, He lays that Fortune at his Daughter's Feet. [Amyntas and Pastora kneel to Ãgon. While Iphis, of Ianthe's Heart possess'd, Receives the Fortune which his Love bestow'd, And by Alliance makes me twice his Father. [Iphis and Ianthe kneel to Arcas, &amp;c. Am. O where shall Duty, Gratitude, and Joy Find Words to utter what our Hearts conceive! Iph. Amazement, Praise, and Admiration, fill The Soul with Transports, too sublime for Speech! Arc. Continue, by your Virtues, to deserve your Fortune; You give me, then, not only Praise, but Triumph! Iph. Amyntas! Embracing. Am. âIphis! Iph. âFriend! Am. âMy Brother now. Past. O kind Ianthe! Embracing. Ian. O Pastora! How! How shall I thank thee, for Amyntas' Joy? Past. Excel me, if thou can'st, in Love to Iphis? Am. Do that, Ianthe, and Amyntas' Truth Shall emulate thy Kindness to Pastora. Iph. Do that, Amyntas, then shall Iphis' Love Redouble thy Endearments on Ianthe. AIR XVIII. Ian. Thus we to Virtue give All that we thence receive. Iph. to Am. Be to Pastora kind, Amyntas here shall find What there he gives, Ianthe here receives. Am. to Iph. Be to Ianthe kind, Kind Iphis here shall find What there he gives, Pastora here receives. Past. to Ian. Be to thy Iphis kind, Ianthe here shall find What there she gives Amyntas here receives. Ian. Thus all receive The blended Joys we give. Now say the Nymph is cold: Iph. Who calls the Lover bold? Past. and Am. While kind, and true? Ian. Now every killing Care, Past. Of Jealousy, or Fear, Ian. and Past. Adieu, adieu! Omnes. Adieu, adieu! [End with the first part. Ãg. Why, ay, my Lord, here Love appears in Triumph! Speaks from the Heart, and flames with Innocence! Where shall we find, in pompous Courts, or Cities, Desires so Cordial, so refin'd by Virtue? Arc. Where-ever Pride, Deceit, or sordid Views Are banish'd, Ãgon, we shall always find them. Let us not think our Children only bless'd, Because the general World makes light of Virtue; Could Millions taste the same exalted Bliss, It rather, then, might heighten our Contentment. Ãg. Why be it so, my Lord: But since Mankind Shew, by their sensual Practice, their Mistake, Let not Us grieve because we can't reform them. Let us exult upon our Choice, and leave Vain-glorious Greatness to its gilded Wishes. This Day, at least, we'll dedicate to Mirth, And give our rural Swains a Jubilee. Arc. A Day like this, indeed, demands our Joy! Hast thou provided, Ãgon, for th'Occasion? Ãg. A Moment's Patience, Sir, you'll find I've not Been idleâ [Exit Ãgon. Arc. âSoft! what Swains are here advancing? To them Corydon, Damon and Phillida. Cor. Long live the Ever noble House of Arcas! May his high Race, from endless Heirs to Heirs, Make many more such Holidays as this Arc. We thank thee, Corydonâ Cor. âNay, my good Lord, The Joy's not all your own: For I myself, At last, have found a Father's Comfort too: Your kind Benevolence has done the Deed. Your double Dowry has reduc'd the Rover, And Damon now is dubb'd a downright Husband. Arc. And Phillida his Bride?â Cor. âEven so, my Lord. I saw the Priest this Moment join their Hands. As for their Hearts, why Troth! they e'en must do, Like other honest Folks, and take their Chance. Arc. In earnest of my Promise, Damon, wear This Ring; and be a Partner of our Joy. Ãgon returns laughing. Ãg. Ha! ha! I'ad like to 'ave brought you, here, a Guest, my Lord! That might have added to our Pastimeâ Arc. âWhom? Ãg. Philautus: but his Modesty, it seems, Thought it became him better to decamp. I met him mounted, with his tawdry Train, All on their Palfries, prancing Post to Corinth: And when I ask'd th'Occasion of his Haste, He scornfully reply'dâOur Women, here, Had neither Sense of Merit, or of Love. So spurr'd his Horse, and staid not for his Farewell. Arc. In Courts, perhaps, he may have better Fortune. Ãg. With all my Heart! There he'll find Beauties, that Deserve such HusbandsâBut now, to our Pastime. I'ave brought you, Sir, a Troop of jolly Swains, Who promise all their Skill to please: Let us Sit down, and take Well-meaning for their Merit. [A Dance, and Chorus of Shepherds, &amp;c. Arc. Now, Ãgon, nought remains, but Nuptial Rites, To consecrate our Children's Happiness. In theirs, methinks, our Spring of Youth returns: While Transport flows in Veins, almost our own, We share the Harvest, which our Cares have sown.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Sung by Ãgon. Since Songs, to Plays, are now-a-days, Like, to your Meals, a Sallad; Permit us then, kind Gentlemen, To try our Skill, by Ballad: While You, to grace our Native Lays, As France has done before us, Belle, Beau, and Cit, from Box and Pit, All join the Jolly Chorus. Chorus. While You, to grace, &amp;c. Poor English Mouths, for Twenty Years, Have been shut up from Musick; But, thank our Stars, Outlandish Airs At last have made all Youâsick. When warbling Dames were all in Flames, And for Precedence wrangled, One English Play cut short the Fray, And home again they dangled. Chorus. Then, Free-born Boys, all make a Noise, As France has done before us; With English Hearts, all bear your Parts, And join the Jolly Chorus. Sweet Sound on languid Sense bestow'd, Is like a Beauty married To empty Fop, who talks aloud, While all her Charms are Buried. But late Experience plainly shews, That common Sense, and Ditty, Have ravish'd all the Belles, and Beaux, And charm'd the chaunting City. Chorus. Then, Free-born Boys, &amp;c. With New Delight, we've try'd To-night Our utmost Skill to win ye; Our only Pray'r, is that you'd spare Poor Signior Cibberini. If what h'has done can warm the Town To set up English Ditty, You'll all confess, h'has not done less, Than had his Muse been Witty. Chorus. Then, Free-born Boys, &amp;c.</field>
