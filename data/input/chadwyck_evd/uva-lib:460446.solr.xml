      <field name="fulltext">OEDIPUS; A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Author composed this Play at the Age of eighteen. It was performed in the Year 1718, and ran five and forty Nights. Du FrÃªne, a celebrated Actor, of the same Age with the Author, played the Part of OEdipus; and Mademoiselle Des Mares, a very famous Actress, (who quitted the Stage a short Time afterwards) that of Jocasta. In this new Edition, the Part of Philocletes is restored, and stands as it was first represented.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The OEdipus, of which this is a new edition, was represented for the first time at the close of the year 1718, and received by the public with great indulgence. Since that time it hath constantly supported itself on the stage, and notwithstanding its defects, is still seen with pleasure; which I partly attribute to the advantage of its having been always exceedingly well acted, and partly to the pomp and pathos of the play itself. Father Folard, a jesuit, and Mr. De la Motte, Mr. De la Motte published two tragedies on this subject in 1726, one in verse and the other in prose; the former was played four times, the latter was never acted at all. of the French academy, have since treated on the same subject, and have both avoided the errors which I had fallen into. It is not proper for me to speak of their performances; my criticisms, and even my praises, would appear equally suspicious. Still less is it my intention to make use of my tragedy as a pretext for laying down a set of rules for poetical composition. I am convinced, that all those refined reasonings, so frequently repeated for several years past, are not worth one scene of genius; and that much more is to be learned from Polyeucte and Cinna, than from all the precepts of the AbbÃ© D'Aubignac. Severus and Paulinus are the true masters of the art. The fight alone of a head by Raphael, will convey to a pupil more instruction in painting, than all the books written by connoisseurs upon that subject. The principles of those arts which depend on the imagination are all easy and simple, all drawn from nature and reason. The Pradons and the Boyers were acquainted with them as well as the Corneilles and the Racines. The only difference has, and always will, consist in the application. The vilest composers had the same rules of music, as the authors of Armida and Isse. Poussin and Vignon worked upon the same principles. It appears then as useless to speak of rules in a preface to a tragedy, as it would be for a painter to preposses the public by dissertations in favour of his pictures, or for a musician to endeavour to demonstrate that his music must infallibly please. But since Mr. De la Motte is desirous of establishing rules directly contrary to those which guided our greatest masters, it is just to defend the ancient laws; not because they are ancient, but because they are good and necessary, and might in a man of his merit meet with a formidable opponent. OF THE THREE UNITIES. Mr. De la Motte would at once proscribe the unities of action, place and time. The French were the first amongst modern nations who revived those wise rules of the stage. Others were a long time unwilling to receive a yoke which seemed so severe: but as this restraint was just, and reason finally triumphed over all opposition, in due time they likewise submitted. At present, even in England, authors affect to acquaint us before their plays, that the action is equal in time to the representation; and in this exceed us who have been their instructors. All nations begin to look upon that Ã¦ra as barbarous, when this practice was unknown to the greatest masters, such as Don Lopez de Vega and Shakespeare, and acknowledge their obligations to us for emancipating them from such barbarism. Should a Frenchman then at this period employ all his talents in endeavouring to reduce us again to the same state? Had I nothing else to say to Mr. De la Motte, than that Corneille, Racine, Moliere, Addison, Congreve, Maffei observed the laws of the drama, it ought effectually to stop the career of every one who has an inclination to violate them: but Mr. De la Motte merits the opposition of reason rather than of authority. What is a dramatic piece? The representation of one action. Why of one only, and not of two or three? Because the human mind cannot take in many objects at once; because the interest which is divided is soon destroyed; because we are offended at seeing, even in a picture, two different events; and finally, because nature has taught us this receipt, which ought to be as immutable as herself. The unity of place is essential for the same reason; for one single action cannot be transacting in many places at the same time. If the personages I see are at Athens in the first act, how can they be in Persia in the second? Has Le Brun painted Alexander at Arbela and in the Indies upon the same canvass? âI should not at all wonder,â Mr. De la Motte ingeniously says, âif a nation, sensible, but not a friend to rules, should reconcile itself to see Coriolanus condemned at Rome in the first act, received by the Volsci in the third, and besieging Rome in the fourth, &amp;c.â In the first place, I cannot conceive a sensible and enlightened people not to be a friend to rules derived from good sense, and calculated for their pleasure. Secondly, is it not manifest, that there would in this case be three different tragedies? And that such a design, were it executed in the finest poetry, would after all be nothing more than a piece of Jodelle's or Hardy's versified by a skilful modern? The unity of time is naturally joined to the two others; of which the following is, I think, a very striking proof. I am present at a tragedy, that is to say, at the representation of an action; the subject is the accomplishment of this one action. A conspiracy is formed against Augustus at Rome; I wish to know what is about to happen to Augustus and the conspirators. If the poet makes the action continue fifteen days, he ought to inform me of what has passed during that time; for I come there to be informed of what passes, and nothing should happen without some use. If, therefore, the events of fifteen different days be represented, there must at least be fifteen different actions, however unimportant they may be, and then it is no longer the completion of the conspiracy only (to which we ought rapidly to proceed) but a tedious history, which interests no more, because it ceases to be lively, and because all its parts are far distant from the decisive moment of which alone I am in expectation. I did not come to the theatre to hear the history of a hero, but to see one single event of his life. Besides, the spectator is at the theatre but three hours; the action therefore should continue no longer; and this rule is observed in Cinna, Andromache, Bajazet, in the OEdipus of the great Corneille, of Mr. De la Motte, and (if I may presume to mention it) in my own. If some other plays require longer time, it is a licence which their beauties only can excuse, and the greater the license is, the more it deserves to be blamed. The unity of time is often extended to twenty-four hours, and the unity of place to the circumference of a palace. The treatment of some beautiful subjects would be rendered impracticable by greater strictness, and a way would be opened to excessive abuses, by more indulgence. For were it once established, that a theatrical action might continue two days, it would perhaps be extended by one author to two weeks, and by another to two years; and if the place of the scene was not fixed to a limited spot, we might soon see tragedies like the old Julius CÃ¦sar of the English, where Brutus and Cassius are at Rome in the first act, and in Thessaly in the fifth. A submission to these laws not only prevents faults, but produces real beauties; as an exact adherence to the rules of fine architecture necessarily composes a building pleasing to the eye. When the unities of time, action, and place are preserved, we must grant that it is very difficult for a play not to be simple. To this, all Racine's dramatic works owe their merit; and this is what was required by Aristotle. Mr. De la Motte, in his defence of a tragedy written by himself, prefers a great number of events to this noble simplicity, and thinks his opinion supported by the little value which was set upon Berenice, and the estimation in which the Cid still continues. The Cid, it is true, is more affecting than Berenice; but Berenice is censurable only, because it is rather an elegy than a simple tragedy; and the Cid, of which the action is truely tragical, does not owe its success to the multiplicy of events, but pleases in spite of this multiplicity; as it affects, not an account of, but in spite of, the infanta. Mr. De la Motte imagines, that we may rise superior to all these rules, by an adherence to the unity of interest, which he tells us was his own invention, and stiles a paradox. But the unity of interest, in my opinion, is nothing but the unity of action. âIf many personages,â says he, âare differently interested in the same event, and all deserve that I should enter into their feelings, this creates an unity of action, and not of interest.â Since I took the liberty of adducing my arguments against Mr. De la Motte, on this little point in dispute, I have reperused the discourse of Corneille on the three unities. The opinion of that great master is much better worth attending to than mine. Observe how he expresses himself. âI maintain then, and I have said it before, that the unity of action consists in the unity of the plot, and in the unity of danger.â Let the reader examine this passage of Corneille, and he will soon be able to decide between Mr. De la Motte and me; and though an authority of such consequence should not prove me to be in the right, is there not a still more convincing argument; namely experience? In perusing our best French tragedies, we shall see that the capital characters are differently interested; but all these different interests refer to that of the principal character, and thus form an unity of action. If these different interests, on the contrary, have no relation to the principal character; if they are not lines terminating in one common center, the interest will be double; and that which on the stage is called action, will be so likewise. Let us then, like the great Corneille, adhere to the three unities, in which the other rules, that is to say the other beauties, are comprehended. Mr. De la Motte stiles those rules, imaginary principles, and thinks we may do very well without them in our tragedies, because we neglect them in our operas: which, in my opinion, is much the same, as to conceive a design of new-modelling a regular government, by the example of an anarchy. OF THE OPERA. The opera is a spectacle as whimsical as it is magnificent; where the eyes and the ears are more gratified than the mind; where its subservience to music renders the most ridiculous faults indispensable; where it is necessary to sing little airs at the destruction of a city, and to dance round a tomb; where we see the palaces of Pluto and of the sun, gods, demons, magicians, illusions, monsters, sumptuous edifices, built and destroyed in the twinkling of an eye. We bear, nay we are charmed, with these extravagancies, because we are in fairy-land: in short, give us but striking machinery, elegant dances, fine music, with some interesting scenes, and we desire no more. To require the unities of action, place and time in Alceste, would be as ridiculous as to introduce dances and demons into Cinna and Rodogune. However though in entertainments of this nature we dispense with these three rules, yet even the operas, in which they are least violated, are certainly the best. And in many (if I am not mistaken) they are to be found; so natural and necessary are they, and contribute so much to interest the spectator. How then can Mr. De la Motte reproach our nation with levity, for condemning in one representation what we approve in another? Every person is capable of giving him an answer. I reasonably expect in a tragedy, much more perfection than in an opera; because in a tragedy my attention is not divided, my pleasure does not depend on a saraband or a minuet, but my mind alone requires to be gratified. I wonder how an author could contrive to bring together, and introduce in one place, and one day, the several parts of a single event, which my imagination with difficulty conceives, and in which my heart is imperceptibly interested. The more I consider the arduousness of this simplicity, the more it delights me; and if I afterwards want to give a reason for my pleasure, I find my opinion agrees with that of Mr. Despreaux, who says, One place, one day, one action should engage, And till the curtain drops, possess the stage. I have likewise, it might be urged, the authority of the great Corneille; but I have still more, his example; and the pleasure his works afford me, in proportion as he has been more or less observant of this rule. Not contented with endeavouring to take away from the drama its essential rules, Mr. De la Motte would abolish its poetry likewise, and give us tragedies in prose. OF POETRY IN PROSE. This ingenious and prolific author, whose whole life has been employed in fabricating verses, or volumes of prose originating from them, writes against his own art, and treats it with the same contempt as he did Homer, whom nevertheless he hath condescended to translate. Neither Virgil, Tasso, Despreaux, Racine, or Pope, had ever an idea of writing against the harmony of verse; nor Lully against music; nor Newton against the mathematics. We have, though very rarely, seen men weak enough to imagine themselves superior to their profession, (which is a sure way to sink beneath it) but we never saw any who wished to debase it. Many there are who despise poetry, because they are ignorant of it. Paris abounds with people of good understandings, but born with organs insensible to all kinds of harmony, to whom music is nothing but noise, and who consider poetry only as an ingenious folly. Should such be informed, that a man of merit, the author of five or six volumes of poetry, is of their opinion, would they not conceive they had a right to look on all other poets as fools, and this as the only one who had regained his senses? For the honour, therefore, of the art, it is necessary to answer him; and I will venture to say, for the honour of a country, which owes a share of its reputation amongst foreigners, to its perfection in this art. Mr. De la Motte affirms that rhyme is a barbarous practice lately invented. All nations, however, upon earth, except the ancient Greeks and Romans, have rhymed and still continue to rhyme. So natural to man is the recurrence of the same sounds, that even amongst savages we find the use of rhyme established in the same manner as at Rome, Paris, London and Madrid. There is in Montagne's works, a French translation of an American song in rhyme. And Mr. Addison, in one of his Spectators, has given us a translation of a Lapland ode composed likewise in rhyme, and full of fine sentiments. The Greeks, âquibus dedit ore rotundo musa loqui,â born under a happier sky, and favoured by nature with organs more delicate than the inhabitans of other countries, formed a language, all the syllables of which, by their length or shortness, could express the slow or impetuous movements of the soul. From this variety of syllables and intonations resulted an harmony both in their poetry and prose, which the ancient Italians felt and imitated; but which no other nation since them hath been able to acquire. However, whether it consists of rhyme or cadenced syllables, poetry (though Mr. De la Motte inveighs against it) hath always been, and always will be, cultivated by the whole world. Even history was always written in verse by the Greeks before the time of Herodotus; a custom borrowed from the ancient Egyptians, who in good sense, policy, and learning, excelled all other nations upon earth. Nothing could be more rational than this custom; for the end of history is to transmit the memory of those few great men posterity, who deserve to be the objects of its imitation. To give the history of a convent, or a petty town, in many folio volumes, was not then thought of. They wrote only what was worthy to be written, what every one was interested to get by heart, and for that purpose had recourse to the harmony of verse to assist the memory. It was on this account that the first philosophers, legislators, founders of religion, and historians, were all poets. When employed on such subjects, poetry might be thought to want in general either precision or harmony; but since these two great excellencies, so seemingly incompatible, have been united by Virgil; since Despreaux and Racine have written like him; how can a man conversant with all three, and who knows they are translated into almost every language in Europe, depreciate thus a talent, which has reflected so much honour even on himself? I place Despreaux and Racine on an equality with Virgil, as to the merit of versification, because had the author of the Ãneid been born at Paris, he would like them have written in rhyme; and had these two Frenchmen lived in the time of Augustus, they would have made the same use which Virgil did of the measure of Latin verse. When Mr. De la Motte therefore calls versification a ridiculous and mechanical labour, his charge of ridiculous must be applied not only to all our own great poets, but all those of antiquity: for Virgil and Horace submitted themselves to a labour as mechanical as that of our own authors. A happy arrangement of dactyls and spondees was altogether as troublesome as our rhymes and hemistichs. Indeed this task must have been very laborious, since the Ãneid, after eleven years spent on its composition, still remained imperfect. Mr. De la Motte asserts, that a scene of a tragedy, turned into prose, loses nothing of its elegance or force. To prove it, he gives as a specimen the first scene of Mithridates, and no one can bear to read it. He does not recollect, that the great merit of verse consists in its being as natural and correct as prose. The overcoming this extreme difficulty is what delights people of correct taste. Reduce it into prose, it has no longer any merit or pleasure. But our neighbours, says he, do not make use of rhyme in their tragedies; true: but they are written in verse, because harmony is agreeable to all people upon earth. All that remains then is to know whether our verses ought to be in rhyme or not. Both Corneille and Racine made use of rhyme. If we therefore wish to strike out a new path, it proceeds, perhaps, rather from an inability of treading in the steps of these great men, than from a desire of novelty. The Italians and the English can do without rhyme, on account of the inversions of their languages, and because their poetry admits a thousand liberties which ours will not. Every language has its genius determined by the particular construction of its phrases, by the frequency of its vowels and consonants, its inversions, its auxiliary verbs, &amp;c. The genius of our language is perspicuity and elegance. We allow no licence in our poetry, which, like our prose, must follow the precise order of our ideas. The recurrence therefore of the same sounds is essentially necessary, that our poetry may not be confounded with our prose. The following verses are universally known. OÃ¹ me cacher? Fuyons dans la nuit infernale. Mais que dis-je? Mon pÃ¨re y tient l'urne fatale: Le sort, dit-on, l'a mise en ses sevÃ¨res mains; Minos juge aux enfers tous les pÃ¢les humaines. Read them thus: OÃ¹ me cacher? Fuyons dans la nuit infernale. Mais que dis-je? Mon pere y tient l'urne funeste: La sort dit-on l'a mise en ses sevÃ¨res mains; Minos juge aux enfers tous les pÃ¢les mortels. How poetical soever this passage may be, will it afford the same pleasure when thus deprived of the charms of rhyme? The English and Italians would both say after the manner of the Greeks and Romans, Les pales humains Minos aux enfers juge, and gracefully run the sense into the next line. We perceive likewise from their manner of repeating verse, the long and short syllables, which still preserve the harmony, without the assistance of rhyme. But why should we, who have none of these advantages, wish to relinquish those which we possess from the nature of our language? Our poets, that is to say our Corneilles, Racines, and Despreaux, are compared by Mr. De la Motte to the makers of acrostics, to one who by sleight of hand causes millet seed to pass through the eye of a needle; and he adds, that all these puerilities have no other merit than that of surmounting a difficulty. This is pretty much the case with bad verses, I acknowledge; they differ from bad prose only in the rhyme, and rhyme alone can never constitute the merit of the poet, or give pleasure to the reader. It is not the dactyls and spondees only, which delight us in Homer and Virgil, but all mankind are struck with the enchanting harmony arising from that difficult measure. He who labours to overcome an obstacle, for the mere merit of overcoming it, is a fool: but he who from those very obstacles draws forth beauties which please universally, must be endowed with uncommon sense, and stands almost alone. Fine paintings, beautiful statues, good music, and good poetry, are works of great difficulty. The names therefore of those superior geniusses, who have overcome these difficulties, will perhaps last much longer than the kingdoms in which they were born. I might here take the liberty of disputing some other points with Mr. De la Motte, but this would, perhaps, look too much like a personal attack, and make me incur the suspicion of malignity, which I am as far from entertaining, as I am from agreeing with him in opinion. I had much rather take advantage of the judicious and fine reflections scattered over his work, than engage in the refutation of some of them, which seem not so well-founded as others. It is sufficient for me to have attempted the defence of an art which I am fond of, and which he himself ought to have defended. I shall only, by Mr. De la Faye's permission, add a word, with respect to the Ode in Favour of Harmony, where he combats the system of Mr. De la Motte, in some beautiful verses, which are answered by him in prose. Mr. De la Faye has collected together almost all the arguments which I have adduced, in the following stanza, full of harmony and imagination. By this constraint of rigorous kind, Which seems to check bold fancy's flight, Is gain'd that happy strength of mind Which wafts her to the loftiest height. As quickened by compressive force The waters quit their lower sphere, Thro' narrow channels urge their course, Impetuous spring and play in air; Thus rules with stricter mandates fraught, And form'd to curb excentric thought, Give surer pleasure to the heart, And stamp the true poetic art. I never met with a comparison more just, more elegant, or more happily expressed. Mr. De la Motte, who should have answered these verses by imitating them, examines whether the pipes make the water rise, or whether the height from which it falls fixes the degree of its elevation. âThen where shall we find,â says he, âthis extraordinary elevation of thought in poetry more than in prose? &amp;c.â I apprehend Mr. De la Motte is mistaken as a naturalist; since it is certain, that without the constraint of these pipes, the water, from whatever height it fell, would not rise at all: but is he not mikaken still more as a poet? How happened he not to consider, that as the constraint of the measure produces an harmony in verse agreeable to the ear, so these narrow channels, in which the enclosed water flows, produce a jet d'eau pleasing to the eye. Is not the simile as just as it is beautiful? Mr. De la Faye has certainly taken a better method than myself. He has acted like the philosopher, who only answered the sophist that denied the existence of motion by walking before him. Mr. De la Motte denies the harmony of verse, Mr. De la Faye sends him harmonious verses; and this ought to instruct me to put an end to my prose.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. PHILOCTETES, DIMAS. DIMAS. Hah! Philoctetes! What dire stroke of fate, In this infected region, hath impell'd thee To search out death? Comest thou to brave the rage Of wrath divine? No mortal on this soil Dares with adventurous footsteps rashly tread. This climate teems with heaven-inflicted vengeance, And in its bosom dwells devouring death. Long time hath Thebes been doom'd a prey to horror, And seems divided from the living world. With speed retreat. PHILOCTETES. These haunts best suit the wretched. Leave me to what my evil fate ordains; And say, if with unpitying ire the gods, Whelming the people, have preserv'd the queen? DIMAS. As yet, O prince! she lives: but the contagion Hath roll'd its baleful venom near the throne. Deprived each moment of some faithful friend, Death by degrees seems stealing on to her. But now we hope, its fury overpast, That heaven in mercy will its arm withdraw, Stretch'd ponderous o'er our heads. Such streams of blood, So many deaths, may well appease its vengeance. PHILOCTETES. Alas! What crime could merit a correction So dreadfully severe? DIMAS. Since the king's deathâ PHILOCTETES. What did'st thou say? Hah! Laius! DIMAS. Four years since That hero died. PHILOCTETES. Is Laius then no more? What sounds are these which thrill my listening sense! What bland seducing hope within my soul Awakens into life! Jocasta! Hah! And will th'immortal powers be more propitious? Shall Philoctetes then at length be thine? Dead, said'st thou! By what accident, relate. DIMAS. Four years are now complete, since at BÅotia For the last time thy steps by fate were guided. Scarce had'st thou left the bosom of thy country, Scarce bent thy way t'ward Asia, when a base Persidious stroke, an inimical hand, Tore from his subjects their unhappy king. PHILOCTETES. Hah, Dimas! fell thy master by assassins? DIMAS. This was the origin of our misfortunes; This crime inwrapp'd our country in destruction. For pierced with anguish at his death, the tear Of bitter sorrow all our thoughts employ'd, When, sight portentous! Dreadful minister Of wrath divine! The innocent destroying, Sparing the guilty, (thy protecting hand, Ah! what avail'd it then far-distant from us!) A furious monster came, and all our coast, Laid waste; the gods, industrious in their work Of gloomy vengeance, had in its formation Exhausted all their power. Born mid the rocks Which gird CithÃ¦ron's base, this prodigy With human voice, an eagle, woman, lion, A dire assemblage from all nature's realms, Join'd rage with craft against us; while but one, One only chance remain'd to save our country. With sense embarass'd, and in words perplex'd, The monster every day in trembling Thebes Prepared a dark enigma framed with art; Which, whosoe'er was willing to assist us, Must in its presence strait expound, or die. Necessity compell'd us to obey This terrible decree. With general voice Thebes offer'd her dominion to the man Whose happy genius, by the gods inspir'd, Could to our ears the mystic sense unravel. The aged, and the wise, seduced by hope, And prompted by illusive science vain, Braved the impenetrable fury's rage; None could its mazes fathom; all expired. But OEdipus, the heir of Corinth's throne, Soaring above his age, despising fear, By fortune led to these abodes of horror, Came, unappall'd survey'd the hideous form, Clear'd all the latent meaning, and was king. And still he lives, still reigns; but his sad power Views none but dying subjects own his sway. Alas! We idly thought his prosperous hand Would chain the fates forever to his throne. Already e'en the Gods seem'd more propitious; And by the monster's death peace bless'd our walls. But barrenness on these devoted plains Too soon with meagre famine brought back death. The gods have urged us on from woe to woe, Famine hath ceased, but not their stern revenge. A baleful pestilence unpeoples Thebes, Aiming its shafts against the feeble few Who yet have scaped the grave. The wrath of heaven Hath thus decreed, and such our dreadful state. But say, successful warrior, whom the gods With smiles behold, from Glory's strict embrace, And fostering bosom, what impels thee hither? What object seek'st thou in this land of terrors? PHILOCTETES. Tears and profoundest grief I hither bring. Mine and the world's misfortune learn. No more The glorious offspring of the gods, like them Invincible, these eyes shall view. The earth Its firm support, afflicted innocence Its tutelary deity, hath lost. I weep my friend, the world laments a father. DIMAS. Alcides dead! PHILOCTETES. O friend! these hapless hands Laid on his pile the first of human beings. Th'all-conquering arrows of the son of Jove, Dear dreadful gifts, I bring. I bring his ashes. And come the hero's tomb to raise, and wait Obsequious on his altars. Had he lived, Trust me, had heaven, less anxious to receive him, Still bless'd mankind with such transcendent worth, Far from Jocasta had my days been spent; And had my passion in my breast revived, Guided by love you would not have beheld me A woman's slave, a traitor to Alcides. DIMAS. Long time with pity have I mark'd thy flame So fervent, yet so pure; in earliest youth It bloom'd, and grew with thy increase of years. Jocasta, by her father forced to wed, Shared with reluctant soul the throne of Laius. Ah! from these nuptials, sprinkled with her tears, The fates in secret wove our said misfortunes. How I admire thy energy of virtue! Thy heart, for mightiest empire justly form'd! Victorious o'er itself! With patient voice Love strove in vain to shake thy settled mind; He was the tyrant who first sunk beneath thee. PHILOCTETES. There flight alone is conquest. Yes, I own it. I struggled many a day, I felt my weakness, So tore myself from this ill-omen'd place, And to Jocasta bade farewel for ever. The world then trembled at Alcides' name, Waiting its fate from his impetuous valour. In all his godlike toils I dared associate; With the same laurel crown'd I march'd beside him. Then my enlightened soul I first perceiv'd Arm'd strong against the passions. To possess A great man's friendship is the boon of heaven. My duty and my fortune in his eyes I read attentive. Faithfully with him I served a long apprenticeship to virtue. My bosom glow'd with strengthened fortitude, Unharden'd still. By rigid honour chain'd Under its laws.âWhat had I been without him? Only the poor descendant of a king, A vulgar prince, a slave to every passion O'er which, by his example taught, I triumph'd. DIMAS. Now then, unmoved by anger or by grief, Thy eyes again can look upon Jocasta And her new husband. PHILOCTETES. Hah! New husband! DIMAS. OEdipus Hath join'd his future destiny with hers. PHILOCTETES. He is too happyâBut I cease to wonder. For he who saved a kingdom, well deserves So rich a prize; the powers above are just. DIMAS. This way he comes; by the high-priest conducted. Th'assembled people join, to deprecate The vengeful wrath of irritated heaven. PHILOCTETES. Compassion melts my soulâI feel a portion Of their calamities. O, great Alcides, From thy etherial height watch o'er thy country! Benignant hear thy friend! His prayers confirm! Be of thy fellow-citizens the God! And let their vows ascend to thee with mine! SCENE II. HIGH PRIEST, CHORUS. The Gate of the Temple opens, and discovers the High Priest with the People round him. FIRST PERSON OF THE CHORUS. Contagious spirits! Tyrants of this empire! Who breathe within these walls the blast of death; Redouble your slow violence against us! Spare us the horror of two long a fate! SECOND PERSON. Strike, ye all-powerful gods! Your victims stand Devoted. Crush us, O ye mountains! Fall Upon our heads, ye heavens! O, Death, thy aid, Thy dreadful aid, with fervour we implore! O, Death, preserve us! haste, and end our days! HIGH PRIEST. No moreâYour lamentable clamours cease: Weak comfort to the miseries of the wretched. Let us beneath the god who means to prove us Submissive bend. He by a word destroys, And by a word can save. He knows that death Incircles these our walls. The cries of Thebes Have mounted to his throne. But lo! the king! Heaven will, thro' me, accost him. From his eyes The fates will now the mystic veil withdraw. The time is perfect. This important day Will change the fate of him and of his people. SCENE III. ÅDIPUS, JOCASTA, HIGH PRIEST, EGINA, DIMAS, ARASPES, CHORUS. OEDIPUS. O ye, who bringing to this fane your woes, Present your tears for offerings to the gods! Would on myself that I could turn their vengeance! And stifle in its latent feeds that death Which haunts your footsteps! But in general danger, A king is but a man, his utmost power Can only share it with you. Say, thou minister [To the High Priest. Of those immortal gods whom Thebes adores, Do they still scorn the voice of humble prayer? Will they relentless view our final ruin? Are these high rulers of mankind still deaf, And silent still? HIGH PRIEST. King! People! All attend! This night before my eyes the flame of heaven Descended on our altars. By its light The shade of mighty Laius stalk'd around, Horrid, and breathing dire revenge and rage, With dreadful voice thus audibly it spake. âVengeance still sleeps upon my mouldering ashes; âThe murtherer of the king still lives in Thebes, âAnd with contagious breath infects the climate; âHe must be known, he must be punish'd. Vengeance âOn him inflicted, gives the people safety.â OEDIPUS. Thebans, I own, this crime without excuse Merits the heavy chastisement you suffer. Laius was dear to you, and this neglect Hath urged his sacred manes to revenge. Such often is the lot of justest kings. While on the earth, respect attends their laws, Their equity is e'en to heaven exalted, Their subjects bow to them with adoration, No longer men, but gods. When sunk in death, What are they then? The incense you extinguish, Which erst was burnt before them, and as mean And sordid interest binds the human soul, The virtue which is past is soon forgotten. Thus while you deprecate Heaven's vengeful rage, The blood of Laius rises up against you. Let us appease its cries; and shed his murderer's; Which in the place of slaughtered hecatombs Should smoke around his grave. With all our care Let us the base offender seek. How strange! Is there no witness of a monarch's death? Of all these signs, and numerous prodigies, Hath not one led the traces to explore Of this unpunish'd crime? I always heard It was a Theban who against his prince Lifted his impious arm. For me, O queen, [To Jocasta. To whom thy hands consign'd his crown, two years After his death I mounted on his throne; Nor from that day, respecting sacred grief, Have I the subject of thy tears recall'd. Thy dangers only have alarm'd my soul, And to all other thoughts closed each access. JOCASTA. Prince, when the fates reserving me for you, Snatch'd by an unforeseen and sudden stroke My former lord, when o'er his kingdom's frontiers The hero journeying fell beneath the hands Of base assassins, Phorbas was the sole Companion of his way, his firm support, And faithful counsellor; Laius, who well knew The zeal and wisdom of the man, with him The weight of his imperial power divided. Slain in his presence, he brought back to Thebes The mangled body of his king; all pierced With wounds himself, scarce moving his faint limbs, Embathed in blood before my knees he fell. âThese eyes (he cried) beheld your murther'd lord; âRuffians unknown struck the dire blow. They left âMe too expiring; but the Power Supreme âTo the sad remnant of my days hath given âA new existence.â There he ceased. My heart Impassion'd, saw the melancholy truth Still at a distance; and perhaps incensed At the flagitious deed, Heaven may have veil'd Th'offender from my just revenge. Perhaps Its own eternal purpose to fulfil, That it might punish, made us criminal. Soon after, o'er our fertile plains the Sphinx Spread desolation. Its wild rage alone Fix'd our attention. In such terrors plunged, Hard was the talk t'avenge another's death, When trembling for ourselves. OEDIPUS. This faithful subject, Say, what became of him? JOCASTA. Alas! his zeal And honest services were but ill requited. His power too great not to incur their hate, All were his secret enemies. With rage Impetuous, for the favour he enjoy'd, Nobles and people ardently desired To see his punishment. Him they accused: And with an universal frenzy fired, All Thebes surrounding me, with shouts and clamours, His death demanded. Fearful of injustice On either side, I dreaded to condemn, Or order his discharge. Their eager search Best to elude, conducted secretly, In an adjoining castle I conceal'd him. There, melancholy proof of royal favour, The good old man, thro' four long winters, blames not Me, or the frantic people, but expects His freedom from his innocence alone. OEDIPUS. It is enoughâ Haste! Fly with utmost speed! [To his Attendants. Open his prison! Bring him hither strait! Myself will question him before you all. 'Tis mine t'avenge both Laius and my people. All must be heard, the eye must nicely scan, To pierce the depth of this black mystery. And you, O gods of Thebes! You gods who now Bend listening from on high! You before whom He stands reveal'd, Oh, punish the assassin! Hide thy pure beams for ever from his eyes, Enlightening sun! Let him, his children's horror, His mother's execration, wandering wild, Abandon'd, by the universal race Of men proscribed, bear mingled in his soul Each curse, each torture of th'infernal regions! And may his blood-stain'd and unburied corse Be doom'd a prey to fierce and ravenous vultures! HIGH PRIEST. In this tremendous adjuration We all unite. OEDIPUS. Gods! let at length the criminal alone Feel your vindictive blow! Or if the laws Of your eternal justice to my arm The care of his dread punishment resign; If wearied with resentment stern, you cease To persecute us still; by your command, Give freedom to obedience! If your rage Pursues a crime, the agent undisclosed, Finish your destin'd work, and name the victim. You to the hallow'd done return; go, raise [To the People. Your voice; again interrogate the gods. Let the united ardour of your prayers Force their descent. If Laius was their care, They will avenge his ashes; and conducting A king, himself to error prone, will mark The place where my uplifted arm should strike. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. JOCASTA, EGINA, ARASPES, CHORUS. ARASPES. Yes, all this death-doom'd people speak thro' me, With general voice accusing Philoctetes. Urged doubtless by the fates, once more he visits These haunts of woe, to save us from destruction. JOCASTA. What do I hear, great gods! EGINA. Amaze o'erwhelms me! JOCASTA. Who! Philoctetes! ARASPES. He himself. To whom Should we impute the murther but to him, Who seem'd before our eyes to meditate The fatal blow? 'Twas known, he hated Laius; With difficulty from thy husband's sight That hatred he conceal'd. Imprudent youth Unwarily betrays itself. His face, But ill disguised, shew'd all the latent malice. I know not what offence inflamed his ire, But if the king were only named, too warm, And too unguarded, by a rage enslaved, Which he could not o'ercome, his insolence Dared e'en advance to threats. He left the realm. But soon his wand'ring destiny again Brought to our coast his ever-veering step. Nay more, at that ill-omen'd time, by heaven Distinguish'd by the dreadful parricide, In Thebes he sojourn'd. Since that fatal hour, And not without foundation, the mistrust Of all our injur'd people fell on him. What have I said? In doubt for many a day, 'Twixt him and Phorbas waver'd their suspicion. Mean time the mighty name he gain'd in war, His title so illustrious, earth's avenger, The veneration which against our wills We pay to heroes, smother'd in its birth The voice of Jealousy, and held our blow Suspended. But the times are not the same As then they were. In this tremendous day, Thebes every loitering relict will destroy Of dangerous respect. In vain his glory Speaks to these agitated bosoms; blood The gods demand, and them alone we hear. FIRST PERSON OF THE CHORUS. Pity, O queen! a people who with love Have ever served thee! Imitate the gods In exemplary justice! To our hands Deliver up their victim! Let our prayers From thee ascend! Who can awake their mercy, If not a heart in goodness like their own! JOCASTA. Oh! were my life demanded to assuage Their vengeance, I the sacrifice would yield Without repining. Thebans! who believe This breast of mine not unendow'd with virtue, I offer you my blood. Exact no more. Depart. SCENE II. JOCASTA, EGINA. EGINA. Ah! how I pity thee! JOCASTA. Alas! I envy those who in this fatal place Have reach'd the goal of life. Oh! what condition, What torment, for a pure and guiltless mind! EGINA. 'Tis most undoubted misery. Thy fate Is full of terror. Their erroneous zeal Blindly enkindled, soon with clamorous shouts Th'assembled people will require their victim. I dare not to accuse him: but for thee, What matchless horror, should'st thou find in him Th'assassin of thy husband! JOCASTA. Durst they offer To both an equal insult!âVillainy, And baseness to reside with him!âEgina, Forced as he was to break each tender tie, To hear him thus accused, completes the sum Of my misfortunes.âNo.âAt these suspicions My conscious pride takes fire. He who could touch This soul with passion, cannot but be virtuous. EGINA. A love so constantâ JOCASTA. Think not that my heart Hath nursed the ardour of this fatal flame; I warr'd against it with determined strength. But, dear Egina, to what height soe'er The noble soul may climb, by virtue guided, It will not, cannot, veil its secret movements, Nature's unconquerable progeny: Within the bosom's complicated folds They lurk, thence rush, and seize us by surprise. Up-springing from their ashes, blaze the fires We thought extinguish'd. Purity severe In the unequal conflict strives in vain; She may resist the passions, not destroy them. EGINA. A grief so just, not Virtue can condemn; And from such thoughtsâ JOCASTA. What miseries do I suffer! Thou, dear Egina, know'st my inmost heart, And all its anguish. Twice these eyes have seen The lighted torch of Hymen; bending twice Beneath th'oppressive fates, my lot of slavery, Or rather punishment, have I exchanged. Whilst he, of all mankind, whose tender impulse My soul confess'd, was from my aching sight Torn, torn forever. Pardon, mighty gods! Memory's fond sad reflection; it explores The melancholy traces of a fire Which I have conquer'd. Thou beheldst, Egina, With what reciprocal delight our souls Inbibed the tender passion, Thou beheldst Each tie no sooner fasten'd than dissolved. My sovereign loved me, and obtain'd my hand, Spite of myself; my brow, on which sate heavy Self-loathing Care, then wore a diadem. By wedlock's laws compell'd, it was but just That I should strive to banish from my mind My love and former vows. Bound to my duty, And that alone, I check'd my secret feelings, And stifled their revolt; disguised my grief, Fed on my tears, nor even to myself Dared own the hidden cause of my distress. EGINA. How then couldst thou resolve again to prove The fatal yoke of Hymen? JOCASTA. Ah, Egina! EGINA. May I unblamed each private thought disclose? JOCASTA. Thy speech is free. EGINA. Then may I not affirm That OEdipus inspired thee with affection? At least the struggle was not violent; And as a recompence thy heart was given To him who saved thy country. JOCASTA. Gracious gods! EGINA. Was he more bless'd than Laius? Did thy soul Retain no trace of absent Philoctetes? Or was it, say, divided in its choice Between the heroes? JOCASTA. A relentless monster Then desolated Thebes: on its deliverer My plighted faith I promised to bestow; He who subdued the Sphinx was worthy of me. EGINA. You loved him then? JOCASTA. Some partiality I felt for OEdipus: but, Oh! these feelings How distant from that amiable defect! This was not a tumultuous fire, Egina, The wildly-vivid offspring of my senses Smit with enchantment; not that burning flame Did I experience, which within my breast By Philoctetes only had been kindled, Which shed delicious poison on my soul, And seduced reason by its fatal charms. Friendship sincere I felt for OEdipus, And, being virtuous, I esteem'd his virtue. My heart with pleasure saw him mount the throne Of Thebes, which his protecting power had saved. But when at last I dragg'd my tardy feet Behind him to the altar; Oh, Egina! Struck with amazement dire, my troubled soul Unusual tumults felt, the cause unknown; At length, with horror I beheld myself Devoted to his arms. A dreadful omen This marriage consummated. I beheld At dead midnight, near OEdipus and me, Th'infernal regions; its eternal gulph Open'd before my feet; the bloody shade Of my first lord stood in the drear abyss, With pale and threatening aspect. To my son Whom erst I bore, his own unhappy offspring, He pointed stern; that son whom to our gods My pious zeal, and cruelty unjust, Offer'd a secret sacrifice. Both seem'd Commanding me to follow them; both seem'd To drag me down to Tartarus profound. Lost in a whirl of thought, my anxious soul Still to itself presents, and still broods o'er This horrid vision. Philoctetes holds E'en now, too firm possession of my heart, And adds new terror to my fatal woes. EGINA. Hark! He approaches. I behold him near. JOCASTA. 'Tis heâI tremble. Let us shun his presence. SCENE III. JOCASTA, PHILOCTETES. PHILOCTETES. Do not avoid me; tremble not, Jocasta; With confidence behold me; hear, and answer. Think not that I am come with jealous grief Rudely to interrupt the new delights Of thy auspicious marriage. Low reproaches, And abject sighs, unworthy of us both, From me expect not. Far from us be driven The vulgar converse, by soft languor taught To ordinary lovers. NoâA heart Still with thy image warm'd; nay more, a heart (If yet thy memory owns the broken ties) For which thine felt some tenderness, hath learn'd By thy example not to shew its weakness. JOCASTA. Thus souls like ours should think. I ought to lead The glorious way, or follow thee, my guide. Yet tho' my heart its dearest wish hath lost, Union with thee, it well becomes Jocasta, And much imports, to vindicate her conduct. My love was thine; but some o'er-ruling power, Spite of myself, hath always sway'd my fate. The furious Sphinx, the gods' avenging wrath, Events well-known, no doubt have reach'd thy ear. Thou know'st what plagues have burst like lightning on us; That OEdipusâ PHILOCTETES. I know he is thy husband; I know him worthy of that envied lot. And in defiance of his youth, the realm Of Thebes, which by his wisdom was preserved, His deeds heroic, and his many virtues, But above all, thy choice, have lifted high This happy prince in the exalted rank Of most illustrious kings. Ah! why did Fate, Constant in injuries, to foreign lands My inconsiderate valour urge away? If 'twas decreed, the conqueror of the Sphinx Should vanquish thee, why was I doom'd to wander, And seek to perish at a distance from thee? I should not with vain toil have strove to pierce The subtle trifles, and the mystic sense, Disguised beneath a cloud of words obscure; This arm, with double vigour nerv'd by thee, Inured the sword of victory to wield, Had cast the monster's head before thy feet. But now Jocasta is another's conquest; This bright excess of glory is another's. JOCASTA. Thou know'st not yet the scope of thy misfortunes. PHILOCTETES. Thee and Alcides lost, what need I fear? JOCASTA. Thou tread'st a soil which some revengeful god Abhorrent views. Contagion all-inflamed With progress dire announces his fell wrath. The blood of Laius on our heads descends. Its fury roused, celestial justice thus Pursues our steps, thus punishes our guilt, For the neglected ashes of the king. To immolate th'assassin on our altars We are commanded. He hath long been sought. And now thy name is echoed by the people. Thou art accused. PHILOCTETES. I'm lost in silent wonder. The very thought of such a crime, binds up My valour in amaze, and chains my tongue. Me of this deed of horror!âMe of murther!â And of thy husband!âThou canst ne'er believe it. JOCASTA. No, never. What injustice to thy fame, Should I a moment's waste of time allow To combat the imposture! All thy heart To me is known, my utmost confidence I there deposited, nor can that heart E'er prove unworthy of the sacred trust. Forget these Thebans, by the gods abandon'd, Worthy to perish, since their base suspicion Dared fall on thee.âBut flyâThe time is pastâ In vain we love. The gods for thee reserve A nobler destiny: and born for them, They would not in their deep designs of wisdom Immure in Thebes an arm endow'd with strength To bless the world. Nor e'er permit that love, Thy mighty heart inthralling, should controul And chain thy valour in obscurity, Link'd to Jocasta. Noâthe timid cares, And fond solicitudes, delightful bonds Of that soft passion, ought not to possess Him who succeeds Alcides. All thy thoughts Are claim'd by the unhappy; them to serve, Thy virtues and thy valour are engaged. Already tyrants in each harrass'd realm Appear again. Alcides is intomb'd, And new-born monsters rise. Goâfrom the fires Dazzling thy senses freed; goâHercules To the astonish'd universe restore. But see, the king! Permit me to retire. Not that my ruffled bosom fears its weakness: But I should feel the deepening blush, beholding Thee whom I love, and him my present lord. SCENE IV. ÅDIPUS, PHILOCTETES, ARASPES. OEDIPUS. Araspes, say, is this the prince we seek? EubÅan Philoctetes? PHILOCTETES. Yes, 'tis he, Who by blind fortune to these walls impell'd, And Heaven's relentless ire pursuing still, Hath suffer'd unaccustom'd wrongs. I know The crime with which low malice hath assay'd To blacken my pure fame. But think not thou That I shall stoop to justify my deeds. Nor do I deem of OEdipus so lightly, As to believe his soul can e'er descend To jealousy so mean. If both our feet Mark the same track, thy honour is with mine Strictly united. Theseus, Hercules, Myself, have pointed out to thee the path Which thou hast enter'd on, the path to glory. Oh! do not, by a calumny, obscure Th'heroic brightness of these names, with which Thine claims alliance. But with utmost care, By generous acts, the dignity support Of thy high-raised proximity to them. OEDIPUS. To serve mankind, and from destruction dire This wretched land to rescue, is the height Of my ambition. In disastrous times, This lesson hath been taught me by the heroes Whom thou with emulation hast pursued, And I admire. Forbid it, all ye powers, That I should taint thy glory which a crime! Had Heaven reserved the fatal choice to me, I would have yielded up myself the victim. Whene'er his country bids, to lay down life, This is a monarch's duty, the bright gem Of royalty, too rich to give to others. I would with pleasure have my life resign'd, And warded off the blow from thine: once more I would have saved my people. But free-will Is shackled now; the criminal must bleed; Thou art accused; prepare for thy defence. If clear thy innocence; my heart well-pleased Shall in the court of Thebes delight to grace A warrior like thyself. Most truly happy To meet thee there, not as a man to whom Guilt is imputed, but as Philoctetes. PHILOCTETES. Now, by the faith of my illustrious name, I tell thee, prince, elate with conscious pride, This bosom thought itself above suspicion. This hand accused by Thebes, hath in defect Of Heaven's dread thunder, freed the burthen'd earth From infamous assassins; Hercules Strengthen'd my arm, and they have bit the dust. He who with just avengement punish'd them, Will never dare to follow their example. OEDIPUS. Nor do I think from consecrated deeds Of great renown, thou wouldst imbrue thy hands In crimes detested. If beneath thy sword Laius expired, doubtless he fell with honour; And as a hero ought, thy arm subdued him. I do thee ample justice. PHILOCTETES. Hah! and where Had been the wond'rous crime, if this keen sword Had number'd Laius with the dead? To me His death had been but one small trophy more. A king is in his subjects' eyes a god, Survey'd with awe. To Hercules and me He is a common man. My guardian care Hath oft protected kings; judge then if he Who could avenge them, would retreat, nor meet The proudest of them all in mortal fight. OEDIPUS. Of Philoctetes, and his worth far-famed, I am not ignorant. Full well I know That heroes like himself with monarchs hold Glorious equality.âBut doubt not, prince, That he who conquer'd Laius merits death; His head will answer for the woes of Thebes. And thouâ PHILOCTETES. I slew him notâLet that suffice, If mine the deed, I would not have conceal'd, But gloried in it. Hear me, OEdipus, For thou art bound to hear. Mere common men, Plain ordinary souls, by vulgar means May justify their actions: but a prince, A warrior, such, for instance, as thyself And Philoctetes, when he speaks the word, On his integrity and spotless faith, Deserves, and gains belief. Doth OEdipus Suspect that murther'd Laius fell by me! To fix on any name the accusation I'll becomes him. His sceptre and his wife To thee have been transmitted; all the fruits Of his unhappy death by thee were gather'd. It cannot be affirm'd, that I with bold And fortunate address have claim'd his spoils, Or ask'd his vacant throne; an object, that, Which never tempted me; a station high, But always by Alcides view'd with scorn. With him in perfect liberty I dwelt, No subjects I possess'd, and own'd no master. I have made sovereigns, but ne'er wish'd to be one. But why thus stoop to justify my deeds! Virtue self-vindicated, is debased. OEDIPUS. Thy virtue charms me, whilst thy pride offends. Judgment awaits thee, prince; thy innocence, If fearing nought from the just laws' decree, Will with redoubled splendor shine reveal'd. With us remain. PHILOCTETES. Assuredly I will. My honour on th'event depends. And Heaven, All-hearing Heaven, forbids me to depart, Till its avengement hath repaid these wrongs, Suspicions base, which stain my cheeks with shame. SCENE V. ÅDIPUS, ARASPES. OEDIPUS. Trust me, Araspes, to believe him guilty, Shocks ever finer feeling of my mind. Th'unshaken fortitude of hearts like his Can ne'er with vile abasement stoop to wear Dissimulation's garb. Such thoughts sublime From groveling falsehood never could proceed. In vain my eyes would mark a single trace Of infamy in him. Nay, I confess, When thus reluctantly compell'd t'accuse Th'heroic man, my very inmost soul Glow'd with the penetrative blush of shame; While Conscience, with indignant murmurs, stiled My rigour too excessive. Cruel lot! Fatal necessity of empire! Kings The human bosom cannot read. The weight Of their resentment oftentimes descends On the meek head of injured innocence. And spite of all our vigilance, Araspes, We are unjust.âHow slow the steps of Phorbas For my impatient ardour! All my hopes Center in him alone. For heaven's high powers Incensed, will deign no answer to our prayers, Their silence manifests the stern denial. ARASPES. When by thy own assiduous industry These mysteries may be pierced, what need to wait Celestial revelations? These high powers, Whose aid the priest hath promised, do not always Reside within their temples, and the arm So lavish in miraculous effects Is still unseen. Tripods and cells, from whence Their oracles proceed, the mouths of brass Which our creative hands have fashion'd, oft Are animated by a breath impure. Recline not then upon the faith of priests In dangerous repose; e'en at the altar The traitors stand, usurp a right divine, And under that commission stamp us slaves. While at their will th'obsequious destinies Speak, or are silent.âSee, examine strictly Th'EubÅan prince, Phorbas, and e'en Jocasta. Trust to thyself; let our own eyes determine. These are our tripods, oracles, and gods. OEDIPUS. Hah! and shall treachery like this be found Within the temple! NoâLet Heaven but give A final arbitration to our fates, And the deposit of my country's safety, This precious trust, shall ne'er again be seen Polluted by unworthy hands.âI goâ I haste myself their silence to accuse; And strive by my incessant prayers to bend Th'obdurate powers. Mean time, if thou wouldst prove Thy ardour to assist me, fly, urge on The tardy step of Phorbas. To this state Of dubious, sad calamity reduced, I will interrogate both gods and men.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. JOCASTA, EGINA. JOCASTA. Yes, his approach I wait, and on this spot Have fix'd, for the last time, that Philoctetes Before these eyes appear. EGINA. Full well thou know'st To what a height of daring insolence The people with tumultuous shouts have borne Their wild licentious fury. Death-besieged, The Thebans, in his punishment alone Have placed their hopes of safety. Old men, women, Children, by their calamities o'erwhelm'd, Are interested all to find him guilty. Thou rather wait'st here, their seditious cries. His blood they seek, and on the gods' behalf Demand that it should flow. Canst thou oppose The torrent of their violence? Assist him? Or dare to take upon thee his defence? JOCASTA. I! Can I dare?âShould all the Thebans list E'en against me their parricidal hands; Should I be crush'd beneath these smoaking walls, I would not injured innocence betray. But still my spirits feel a just alarm; This hero once possess'd my heart. They know it. They will proclaim, I sacrifice to him My fame; my gods, my husband and my country; That still my bosom glowsâ EGINA. Oh! calm these fears. This luckless love no eye but mine beheld. And neverâ JOCASTA. Hah! And dost thou think a princess Can e'er her hatred or her love conceal? On us the courtiers with avidity From every side their ceaseless glances cast. Across the path of their respect, steal in Their treacherous cringings, penetrate our hearts, And search out all their weakness. Nought escapes Their malice; by a word, a sigh, a look, We are detected. All things speak against us, Ev'n our silence. And when thus employ'd, Their persevering artifice, at length, Spite of ourselves, hath drawn each secret forth. With indiscreet discourses out they rush, Our lives emblazon with a guilty light, And publish all our passions to the world. EGINA. Ah! from their efforts what hast thou to dread? What piercing looks are dangerous to thee? What penetrated secret can eclipse Jocasta's glory? If they know thy love, They know thy victory; and know that virtue Was always thy support. JOCASTA. Alas! that virtue E'en now distresses me. Severely apt T'accuse myself, perhaps I scrutinize Each action with too much austerity; Perhaps I judge myself with too much rigour. Yet must I own that Philoctetes once Reign'd o'er my heart with absolute controul. Fix'd is his image in that hapless seat, Still uneffaced by virtue or by time. Alas! I doubt, when striving thus to save him, If justice only prompts me to his aid. Too sensible, too feelingly-alive, This pity seems. My arm up-raised to ward The fatal blow, trembles through every nerve. This tenderness and soft excess of care I cannot but condemn, for, ah! I feel If less my love, I could have served him more. EGINA. And will'st thou then his absence? JOCASTA. Canst thou doubt it? It is my only hope, and if he still Regards my voice, if aught my prayers avail, Never again must he behold Jocasta; But fly an exile from these dreary walls, And far, far distant, my unsullied fame And his own life preserve.âBut who detains him? The time requires his presence. Dear Egina, Go, and with utmost speedâ SCENE II. JOCASTA, PHILOCTETES, EGINA. JOCASTA. Behold! he comes. Oh, prince, that I have wish'd once more to see thee Needs no excuse, whilst agonizing fears Thus harrow up my soul. The voice of duty Bids me avoid thy presence; to forget, And not betray thee. Know'st thou the dire fate, Which aim'd against thee, unrelenting rage E'en now prepares? PHILOCTETES. I know the giddy people, In rash tumultuous violence combined, Demand my life. But great have been their suff'rings, And tho' unjust, I cannot but forgive them. JOCASTA. Trust not to their intemperate wrath! Beware! Fly, whilst thou still art master of thy fate. This moment is, perhaps, the last allow'd By Heaven to snatch thee from a shameful death. Flyâfar from me precipitate thy steps. And as a recompence for life preserved, Forget that she who saved it was Jocasta. PHILOCTETES. Oh, cease for this afflicted heart to shew So much of pity! Call up all thy firmness! With me prefer my honour to my life; Command my death, and interdict my flight. Compel me not, when innocent, to form A league with abject guilt, by my obedience. By Heaven's avenging anger dispossess'd Of every other good, it still hath left My glory and my honour; take not from me These, which with sacred jealousy I guard, These jewels of inestimable price. Make me not thus unworthy of thy care. NoâI have lived; the sum of my sad fate Is now, perhaps, complete. To OEdipus My word is past. And whatsoe'er suspicion May in his breast intrude, this soul of mine Ne'er knew the stain of violated faith. JOCASTA. Oh, by the gods above! By that pure flame Which sad Jocasta kindled in thy breast! If for so tender and so true a friendship Thou still retain'st some small remains of pity; If, foster'd in thy memory, still survive Our mutual vows; if thou hast not forgotten That all my happiness on thine depended, Deign to preserve that life encompass'd round With glory's radiant beams, a life with which I feel the thread of mine inwoven firm. PHILOCTETES. To thee I will devote it, and shall strive That all its course may be entirely worthy Of thee and of thy virtues. I have lived Far distant, but most happy is my lot, If thy esteem pursues me to the tomb. Yet, who can say, whether all-gracious Heaven Will e'er this bloody sacrifice survey? Who knows, if in its clemency divine, It urged not on my wand'ring steps to Thebes, That I might fall for thee? Haply the gods This matchless favour owed to Philoctetes, To save thy life by yielding up his own. Perhaps, by spotless blood to be appÃ©ased, They deem mine worthy, and vouchsafe t'accept it. SCENE III. ÅDIPUS, JOCASTA, PHILOCTETES, EGINA, ARASPES, and Attendants. OEDIPUS. Fear not the wild capricious multitude, Whose voice, Oh, prince! thy punishment demands. Their tumults I have calm'd, and come prepared Against their rage, if needful, to support thee. They all suspect the guilty deed was thine, For rash suspicion is the people's birth-right. But I, who judge not with the giddy vulgar, Behold, methinks, thy innocence dispersing This envious cloud, and dazzling e'en their eyes With its clear lustre. Yet I must confess, Still undetermined, my uncertain mind Cannot acquit, nor dares it to condemn. To heaven I bend, the gods alone must judge. At length propitious they will seal our pardon, And soon withdrawing their oppressive arm, Will, by their priest's decree, announce the victim. PHILOCTETES. Unbias'd is thy equity and pure: But justice in extreme, becomes th'excess Of injury. We should not always, prince, Obey the voice of rigour. The prime law Which ought to sway mankind, is that of honour. But I am seen to the mean task reduced Of answering vile defamers, whom I well Know to confound. Ah! why shouldst thou descend To this unworthy care! To stand alone, My own impartial witness, would suffice; To set my life before them: Hercules, Conqueror of Asia, firm support of heaven, The monsters, the fierce tyrants, whom he taught This arm to quell, these are the witnesses With which they should confront me. But I now Await your gods; consult their oracle, And learn if they condemn me; not that I Need their assistance, and expect their judgment, Not feeling for myself, but for thy people. SCENE IV. ÅDIPUS, JOCASTA, HIGH PRIEST, ARASPES, PHILOCTETES, EGINA, ATTENDANTS, CHORUS. OEDIPUS. Doth heaven at length, moved by our humble prayers, Relax its vengeance? Say, whose murtherous hand Hath thus provoked its anger? PHILOCTETES. Say, whose blood Doth it command ill-destined Thebes to shed? HIGH PRIEST. Pernicious gift of heaven! Unhappy knowledge! To th'ever-restless prying mind of man Pregnant with danger! Ye relentless fates, Who now stand open to my view! Oh, cast Henceforth a veil eternal o'er my sight! PHILOCTETES. What dire event com'st thou prepar'd t'unfold? OEDIPUS. Art thou the stern prophetic minister Of inextinguishable hate? PHILOCTETES. Disclose Thy thoughts with fearless mind. OEDIPUS. Do the just gods Demand my death? HIGH PRIEST. Oh! if thy confidence On me reposes, ask me not a word. OEDIPUS. Whate'er of terror prompts the voice of Heaven, Upon its answer hangs the fate of Thebes. PHILOCTETES. Speak. OEDIPUS. Look with pity on this wretched race! Oh! think that OEdipusâ HIGH PRIEST. Alas! he merits Superior pity. FIRST PERSON OF THE CHORUS. With paternal zeal He loves his people; to his voice we join Our ceaseless prayers. Thou whom high heaven inspires, Hear, hear our cries! SECOND PERSON. We sink; we perish allâ Oh, save us! turn its fury from our heads! The murtherer nameâthe monsterâthe perfidiousâ FIRST PERSON. Our eager hands shall in his guilty blood The criminal imbrue. HIGH PRIEST. Unhappy men! What do you seek from me? FIRST PERSON. Speak but the word, He dies, and we are saved. HIGH PRIEST. When I remove Fate's dark o'erwhelming cloud, horror will freeze Your souls to hear the murtherer only named. The god who at this awful period prompts My tongue to speak, commands that banishment Be the sole penalty exacted from him. But soon to desperate deeds of frenzy urged, His own avenging hand shall join to aid The wrath severe of heaven. While terror-struck, Your eyes his horrid punishment shall view, And your afflicted hearts confess that life Was purchased at too dear a price. OEDIPUS. Submit. PHILOCTETES. Declare. OEDIPUS. Why thus inflexible? HIGH PRIEST. Compell'd by thee I speak. OEDIPUS. Why thus inflame My anger by delay? HIGH PRIEST. Thou wilt then know The wholeâAlas! it isâ OEDIPUS. Who is it? HIGH PRIEST. Thou. OEDIPUS. I!â HIGH PRIEST. Thou; unhappy prince. SECOND PERSON OF THE CHORUS. Alas! what sounds Struck my astonish'd ear! JOCASTA. What hast thou dared To utter, sage interpreter of heaven!â Hah! thou, the murtherer of my husband! Thou, [To OEdipus. To whom his crown, to whom myself I yielded! No, OEdipus, the gods, the oracle, Sport with our weak credulity. Thy virtues On their accusing voice retort the falsehood. FIRST PERSON OF THE CHORUS. Ye powers, who o'er the fate of man preside, Name, name another! or again bring back Averted death! PHILOCTETES. Think not I bear a soul Which injury for injury returns. Or from this marvelous and sudden change Of fortune, which my wond'ring eyes behold, That I shall basely triumph o'er affliction. Spite of this voice of heaven, I think thee guiltless. That justice thou and partial Thebes denied To me, receive; that justice is thy due. Against thy foes accept my shielding arm. Between a pontiff and a prince, no need Of hesitation. Whosoe'er he be, Whatever god his voice inspires, a priest Should always pray for, and not curse his king. OEDIPUS. Excess of virtue!âVile impiety! From which my soul shrinks back with horror!âHere A demi-god addresses me, and there A fraudful priest. [To the High Priest. Behold the privilege Of altars! Thanks to their benignant power Protecting guilt, thy sacrilegious tongue Hath not refused the commerce of the gods, With matchless insolence to prostitute, And fix a crime detested on thy prince. And dost thou think that my awaken'd wrath Shall longer venerate the sacred office Thy hands defile? No, traitor, thou shalt die, Die at the altar, and before thy gods; The gods thy crafty voice hath taught to speak. HIGH PRIEST. My life is in thy power; its master thou. Make then the utmost of the present time, While thou canst call that power thy own. To-day Thy doom will be pronounced. Unhappy king! Tremble, thy reign is past. A hand unseen Over thy head suspends the threatening sword Sharpen'd by vengeance. Soon thy soul appall'd Shall view its crimes with horror. Thou shalt fly Far from the throne thy youthful valour gain'd, And gloriously ascended. Soon deprived Of wholesome water, and of sacred fire, Thy loud laments shall fill the desart caves. Where'er thou tread'st, with an avenging scourge Some god shall mark thee still. To end thy pangs Oft shalt thou invocate the stroke of Death, But Death shall not attend thy call. While heaven, That heaven, which views such complicated scenes Of sad distress, shall to thy eyes expand One dreary waste of darkness horrible. Spite of thyself, to crimes thou wert fore-doom'd, Fore-doom'd to punishment; and thou shalt think Transcendent happiness had been thy lot, If thou hadst ne'er been born. OEDIPUS. Thus far I have restrain'd my glowing rage, That I might hear thee, priest. If I could stoop Such worthless blood to spill; at least with pleasure I should behold thy justly-purchased death Precede th'accomplish'd prophecy. But hence! Tempt not impetuous passion. Dread the flame Thy presence animates to fury. Hence, Vile author of detested forgeries! HIGH PRIEST. Thou scorn'st me as a traitor and impostor; Alas! thy father thought me more sincere. OEDIPUS. Return! What dost thou say? Who? Polybus? My father? HIGH PRIEST. Ah! too soon thy evil fate Shall stand reveal'd; this day will give thee birth, And give thee death; thy sum of destiny Is now fulfill'd, and thou shalt know thyself. Unhappy! Art thou conscious from what blood Thy being is derived? With crimes encompass'd Peculiarly thy own, dost thou e'en know With whom thou livest? Oh, Corinth! Phocis! Dire And execrable nuptials! Lo! a race Impious, yet most unfortunate, is born; Worthy their parent line, whose desperate deeds Shall fill th'astonish'd universe with horror. Let us away. SCENE V. ÅDIPUS, PHILOCTETES, JOCASTA. OEDIPUS. His last words petrify My torpid limbs. I know not where I am. My passion is becalm'd. As if some god Descending from on high, with absolute And strong controul, each transport had suppress'd, Enchain'd my wrath; and giving to his priest A power divine, had by his dreadful voice Foretold my ruin. PHILOCTETES. If some king alone Had menaced thee with danger, Philoctetes, Copartner in the war, had fought beside thee Under thy standard: but the priestly train Here breathe still more of terror, as they dare Stab you in open day, and claim respect For the malignant blow. Supported firm By his vain oracles, a pontiff oft Keeps the crown'd head in awe; while with blind zeal The superstitious multitude, enthrall'd In holy bonds, idolatrous and weak, Tread the most sacred institutes beneath Their feet, through piety; and think they honour Th'immortal gods when they betray their king. Chiefly when interest, parent of excess, And barbarous licence, their fanatic crimes Impels, and courage gives to insolence. OEDIPUS. Alas! thy virtues double my affliction. The greatness of thy soul in equal rank With my misfortunes stands. Oppress'd by grief And heart-consuming care, who strives to pour The balm of comfort, adds but to the load Which weighs me down. What deep complaining voice Forth issues from my inmost soul? What crime Have I committed? Oh, avenging Power! Can this be true? JOCASTA. Enoughâno moreâthe crime Is not the present theme. This dying people Require a victimâThebes must be preserved. Th'important hour admits not of delay. The wife of Laius, be it mine to die, To seek the wand'ring melancholy shade Of my first hapless lord upon the shore Of gloomy Styx, I will appease the cries His bloody manes utter. Yes, I go. May this the gods propitiate! May they ask No other death, content with mine alone! And take my flowing blood in lieu of thine! OEDIPUS. Thou yield thy life!âAnd is not then the number Of horrid woes sufficient, thus at once Descending on my head? Cease, cease, Jocasta, This dreadful language. Oh! thy husband's lot Already is too desperate, nor requires That new supplies of torments should assail And tear his heart by violence asunder, Adding the bitter anguish of thy death To close the dire account. But let us hence. Retire with me, Jocasta; I must clear A dark suspicion, which my soul hath form'd Perhaps too justly. Let us hence. JOCASTA. My Lord How canst thouâ OEDIPUS. Follow me. In thee it lies At once to banish, or complete my terrors. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. OEDIPUS, JOCASTA. OEDIPUS. Noâsay whate'er thou wilt, my troubled soul Can find no peace; these fears importunate Raise not the less of tumult; still the priest Holds me enchain'd; and while acquitting him, In secret I begin t'accuse myself. But chief his words, which breathed th'extreme of horror, Have I more deeply scann'd with searching mind. A thousand dark events, by time effac'd, Start up in crouds to my reflecting thought, Which freezes at the sight. The past forbids All regress there, the present overwhelms, The future stretches out a dreadful roll, Mark'd with Fate's blackest characters. Where'er I tread, methinks guilt follows close behind, And urges on my steps. JOCASTA. Doth not thy virtue Cloathe thee in arms of proof? And conscience lift The firm impassive shield of innocence? OEDIPUS. We sometimes bear the wounds of guilt, conceal'd E'en from ourselves. JOCASTA. Oh! treat with due contempt The boisterous words of a rash meddling priest, Nor let thy timid apprehensions thus Excuse his arrogance. OEDIPUS. Say, I conjure thee In mighty Laius' name! By heaven's dread wrath! When he that fatal journey undertook, Did guards attend the king? JOCASTA. Ere now I told thee He had but one companion. OEDIPUS. One alone! JOCASTA. A lofty soul, above the regal state He bore; like thee disdaining idle pomp, The splendid rampart of embattled troops His chariot ne'er surrounded. In the midst Of subjects, who with willing hearts obey'd His sovereign power, as without fear he dwelt, So confident he march'd without defence. He trusted to a grateful people's love, That was his only guard. OEDIPUS. O glorious hero! Granted to men below by bounteous heaven! August, and rare example thou of true And real kings! Could Oedipus against thee Uplift his barbarous hand? Describe, Jocasta, The lineaments of this unhappy prince. JOCASTA. Since thou the sad remembrance wilt recall, Spite of the frost of years, in vigorous age His eyes still sparkled with the fire of youth. Scarr'd by a glorious wound, his aweful brow, Beneath his silver locks, impress'd respect And veneration on the breasts of all, Who view'd him with admiring eyes. To speak My secret thoughts, he much resembled thee. In thee well-pleas'd his image I behold, Thine are his virtues, and his features thine. What have I utter'd to alarm thee thus? OEDIPUS. I set inwrapp'd in darkness and in clouds, Misfortunes which my eyes would trace in vain. I fear the priest, by heaven itself inspired, The horrors of my evil fate perceived In clearest light. Have I! Have I then murder'd! Immortal gods! can it be possible? JOCASTA. And dost thou think these instruments of heaven Infallible? Their holy ministry Devotes them to the altar; they approach The powers celestial; but themselves are men. Think'st thou, obsequious to their high behests, That truth is subject to the flight of birds? When the bull groans beneath the sacred knife, Say, to their piercing glance, doth he from thence Unveil futurity? And when the victims They deck with flowery wreaths, bear they the fate Of human kind within their entrails?âNo. Thus to explore the hidden depths of truth, Is to usurp the rights of Deity. These priests are not what in their blind conceit The shallow herd imagine. Our credulity, Our weak credulity, is the foundation Of all their knowledge. OEDIPUS. Would to heaven it were! So might I still be happy. JOCASTA. 'Tis most true. Oh, OEdipus! my grief, these flowing tears Demonstrate it too well. There was a time When I, like thee, was t'ward them prejudiced. Alas! sad state of misery for me, That I am undeceived! The punishment Of heaven hath fall'n severely on my head, For list'ning to the dark mysterious lore Of forged responses from the hallow'd shrine. Dear was the price I paid, I lost my son. Detested oracles! but for your voice, But for your execrable mandates, still My son might have survived. OEDIPUS. Thy son! Thy son! Say, how? What accident deprived thee of him? What was the answer from the hallow'd shrine? JOCASTA. Learn, learn in this extremity of danger, What from myself I gladly would conceal, And dread this lying oracle no more. Thou oft hast heard I bore a son to Laius: Fondly solicitous to know his fate, I went, and in the Delphic fane consulted Our god's renown'd interpretess. Alas! What height of madness, anxiously t'extort Those secrets, which the destinies would hide In mercy from our view!âBut 'twas my sonâ And I had all the weakness of a mother. With awe before the priestess' feet I fell. These were her very words; alas, I could not But keep them rivetted within my mind. Forgive me, if I tremble thus with fear At the sole recollection. Thus she spake. âThy son shall slay his father; this thy son âIncestuous, sacrilegious, parricideââ O heaven!âShall I proceed? OEDIPUS. WellâWell. JOCASTA. In short, She then foretold me that this son, this monster, My bed should enter; that I should receive, I, even I his mother, and embrace him, Fresh reeking from the murther of his father. That by these bonds of horrid union join'd, I should bear sons to my ill-fated child. But much already is thy mind disturb'd By this dire narrative: thou dread'st, perhaps, To hear me farther, and attend the sequel. OEDIPUS. Noâlet me hear thee to the end. This infant Mark'd out by heaven for vengeance; what of him? JOCASTA. I credited the gods, and in my heart, Devoutly cruel, stifled for my child Maternal tenderness. In vain its voice Imperious combated the will of heaven, And its decrees condemn'd. I thought to snatch The tender victim from that ruthless fate, Which tyrannizing would have dragg'd him on To crimes unparallel'd, was now become A duty indispensable. I thought To triumph over these predicted horrors, And urged by pity doom'd the babe to death. Oh, guilty pity! most unfortunate! Base treacherous darkness of false oracles! What were the fruits of my inhuman caution? It could not save my wretched husband's life: In the full glory of his prosperous course, From his exalted sphere he fell, cut off, Assassinated by the hands of strangers. His son inflicted not the mortal wound; That son, alas! I lost; yet by his death Could not preserve my husband. Taught from hence, From an example thus replete with terror, These fears, which a deceitful priest inspires, Give to the winds, take warning by my fault, And calm thy ruffled mind. OEDIPUS. Having reveal'd This weighty secret, gratitude demands, And it is just, that I too should repose A dreadful mutual confidence in thee. When thou shalt learn, Jocasta, from my tale Of sad distress, the dire affinity Which reigns between our fates, thy trembling frame Will feel, perchance, the shock of fear, as strong As that which I experience. By my birth, Destined to fill the throne of Corinth, far From Corinth and the regal seat remov'd, My native country I behold with horror. One day (that day of wild affright before My soul arising, chills its powers anew With images of dread) a solemn gift, For the first time my youthful hands had brought, To grace the altar, when, at once self-rent, The vaulted roof wide-open'd, every statue Spontaneous was bedew'd with sanguine stains; The altar with convulsive tremors shook; A hand unseen thrust back my gifts; while rush'd A furious blast forth from the bursting thunder, And to my ear these horrid sounds convey'd. âDare not again approach this hallow'd dome, âThus to defile its purity; the gods âReject thee from the number of the living; âThy impious offerings they receive not. Goâ âAnd to the altar of the furies bear âThy presents; deprecate their serpents' rage, âWhich now are ready to devour thee. Goâ âThese are the gods to whom thy vows are due.â Whilst all my soul I yielded up to fear, This voice (believe me, wond'rous though it seems) All the assemblage of unheard-of crimes Denounc'd to me, with which heaven heretofore Threatened thy son; told me that I should prove Th'assassin of my fatherâ JOCASTA. Oh, ye gods! OEDIPUS. That I should be the husband of my mother. JOCASTA. Where am I? Dearest Ådipus! Alas! What demon link'd our hearts, to weigh us down With this accumulated load of horrors! OEDIPUS. This is, alas! a needless waste of tears; A moment more, and reasons thou shalt learn, Powerful indeed to fill thee with dismay. List then, and tremble through each shivering nerve. By stern necessity compell'd, I left My native land, an exile; for I fear'd, Spite of myself, lest my unguarded hand Might one day be in desperate crimes embrued, And faithful to the fates, who thus against me Waged barbarous war; jealous suspicions, doubts And anxious thoughts oppressed my tortured mind, A burthen to itself. Against the gods I dared not e'en oppose my conscious virtue. But breaking from my mother's fond embrace, With speed departed, and from realm to realm Wand'ring, conceal'd my parentage and name, One friend the sole companion of my way. Yet in this fatal journey, oft the god Who was my guide, in perilous extremes Aided my daring soul, and urged me on To some victorious enterprize. How blest Had I in one of these dire conflicts met A glorious envied death, and thwarted thus My evil destiny!âBut I was saved, Doubtless by more than human means reserved For horrid murther. I remember now, That in the fields of Phocis, (what enchantment Hath caused me till this moment to forget The great event? The hand of Heaven so long Suspended o'er me, hath removed its veil My eyes obscuring) on a fulgid car Drawn by two coursers, in a narrow pass, I met two warriors: the vain trivial honour Of who should first advance, we thought it meet There to dispute: Lofty and young was I, Bred in a rank of life, which with our blood Engenders pride; and in a foreign land A sojourner unknown, fancied myself Possess'd of Corinth's sceptre, and that all Whom chance before me plac'd, were subject vassals, Formed to obey. In short I t'ward them march'd, And stopp'd th'impetuous vigour of their steeds With furious hand; forth from the car at once The warriors sprang, and with repeated blows, Raging, assail'd me; not between us long Victory stood dubious: (all-o'erruling gods! Whether from favour, or from hate, I know not, But surely on my side ye fought against them) Low at my feet both vanquish'd sunk in dust. One of them, I, methinks, behold him now, Hoary with age, extended on the ground, Looked on my face, held out his dying hands, And would have spoke to me; I saw the tears Run down his pallid check; when him I slew, Within my shuddering soul I felt, Jocasta, All-conqueror as I wasâThou tremblestâ JOCASTA. Lo, Phorbas advances; they conduct him t'ward us. OEDIPUS. Now then shall my suspicions be remov'd, Or fixed in dreadful certainty. SCENE II. OEDIPUS, JOCASTA, PHORBAS, ATTENDANTS. OEDIPUS. Approach! Come near, unfortunate old man! his presence Awakes new terrors in my soul, perplexed And vague remembrance busily conspires Still more t'afflict me. At his sight I tremble, Nor dare to question him. PHORBAS. Is this the day Fix'd for my death? Oh, mighty queen, at length Hast thou decreed that I should suffer? Ne'er, But with respect to me, wert thou unjust. JOCASTA. Compose thy mind, and answer to the king. PHORBAS. The king! JOCASTA. Thou stand'st before him. PHORBAS. Oh, ye gods! Laius extinct! And thou, my master! Thou! OEDIPUS. To wave superfluous converse; thou alone Wert witness to his murder; 'tis reported That thou wert wounded striving to defend him. PHORBAS. My royal master is no more; Oh! let His sacred ashes rest in peace; nor thus Insultingly upbraid the luckless fate Of a true subject, who by thee was wounded. OEDIPUS. By me! Wounded by me! PHORBAS. Fill up the measure Of thy revenge, complete the work, and take A life of weariness and care. Thy sword, Which erst was frustrated by Heaven, draw forth, And spill at once these loitering drops of blood, Which then escaped thee. Since thou recollect'st The fatal pass where my dear sovereignâ OEDIPUS. Cease, Unhappy man! and spare me what remains. I perpetrated allâI see it clearlyâ It is enoughâOh, ye immortal powers! After four years, at last, in this dread moment, Ye have unseal'd my eyes. JOCASTA. Oh, agony! Can this be real! OEDIPUS. Ha! Art thou the man, Whom near to Daulis, in the narrow path My rage assail'd?âYes, thou indeed art he. In vain I covet to deceive myself. All speak against me, every circumstance Brings home the accusation; and my eye Struck with amazement cannot fail to know thee. PHORBAS. Thy conscience tells thee true; beneath thy blows I saw my master fall; the crime was thine, And I have been suspected; I have lived In ignominious bonds, and thou hast reigned. OEDIPUS. Henceâthe reverse takes placeâsoon on myself Will I inflict impartial justice.âGoâ Leave me, as well thou may'st, the care of guiding The arm of vengence on this guilty head. Awayâand save me from the pangs of shame, The shame of viewing injured innocence, Destin'd by me to misery and woe. SCENE III. OEDIPUS, JOCASTA. OEDIPUS. Jocastaâfor malicious Fate denies That I should ever call thee by the name, The tender name of wife. Thou seest my crimes; No longer by the bond of faith restrain'd, Which I have broken; strikeâfree thyself at once From horrid union with a wretch like me. JOCASTA. Excess of anguish! OEDIPUS. Take this sharp-edged steel, Detested instrument of frantic rage; Now let it serve thee for a juster purpose; Deep plunge it in my bosom. JOCASTA. Oh, my Lord! What would'st thou? Moderate this wild extreme Of blind and head-strong passion. Spare thy life. OEDIPUS. Hah! What compassion pleads within thy soul For me? I ought to die. JOCASTA. Forbid it, Heaven! Live! Live! Jocasta earnestly intreats theeâ Oh, listen to her prayers! OEDIPUS. I will not, dare not. I slew thy husband. JOCASTA. Thou, thou art my husband. OEDIPUS. I am, but by a crimeâ JOCASTA. Thy will disowns it. OEDIPUS. And what doth that avail? The deed was done. JOCASTA. Oh, load of misery! OEDIPUS. Oh, ill-fated nuptials! Oh, hymeneal fires, erst so enchanting! JOCASTA. Their brightness is the same. Thou still art mine. OEDIPUS. No; I am thine no more: my ruthless hand Hath too completely burst each hallow'd tie. This clime is fill'd with plagues which spring from me, View me with terror; dread th'impelling god Who hurries me along: my timid virtue Doth but unnerve me, and I cannot answer One moment for myself: sharing, perhaps, The fury of this persecuting god, The horrors which my destiny attend Even on thee may fall. At least, with pity Think on so many other wretched victims. Strikeâdauntless strike; thou savest me thus from crimes. JOCASTA. These are Fate's cruel deeds, not thine the blame; Unfortunate thou art, but thou art guiltless. It was impossible that thou should'st know Whose blood it was decreed thy hand should spill In Daulis' fatal conflict. And if memory Sometimes that dreadful accident recalls, Pity may drop a tear; I may lament My evil fortune, but not punish thee. Live thenâ OEDIPUS. Live, say'st thou! Live!âBut I must fly Far, far from thee. Alas! where shall I drag An ever-dying life? What dreary shore, What sad disastrous climate shall I find To bury deep the horror which will cling Close to my footsteps and imprint the soil? Shall I again rove devious? Strive in vain To shun myself? And gain another crown By impious murther? Shall I enter Corinth, Where Fate hath doom'd my hand to perpetrate Crimes more accursed? Oh! never, Corinth, never May thy detested realmâ SCENE IV. ÅDIPUS, JOCASTA, DIMAS. DIMAS. My Lord, a stranger This moment is arrived, he says, from Corinth, And begs to be admitted to thy presence. OEDIPUS. Hence! Let us goâI hasten to receive him. Farewel, farewel! may calm composure smooth [To Jocasta. The yet impetuous torrent of thy grief! But OEdipus, who ne'er again shall taste Sweet consolation, thou wilt see no more. It is decreedâmy reign is finish'dâthou No longer hast a husband.âYielding up The sovereign power, I cease too to be thine. Farewel! I go in my despair to seek Some country where my hand with deeds of guilt May not be stain'd; where, far from thee exiled, Living enthroned, yet always like a king, Each act may justify thy flowing tears.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. OEDIPUS, ARASPES, DIMAS, ATTENDANTS. OEDIPUS. Here let your anxious murmurs cease; restrain Your drops of sorrow; know, this banishment Which you compassionate for me hath charms. My flight to your misfortunes will secure A speedy remedy; you lose your sovereign, But life and future days of bliss are yours. The time is urgent, Thebes, and all her sons, Wait the disposal of their fate from me. When I obtain'd the throne, I saved the state; And as I mounted, so I shall descend; Glory will follow, and illume the shade Of my adversity. Mid all my woes, All my calamities, to give you safety Hath always been my envied lot. I now, My children, throne, and country, quit for you. For the last time then to my words attend. Since ye must have a king, consult my choice. In Philoctetes, bravery, strength heroic, And virtue meet; a monarch is his father; Himself was friend to Hercules. Let me Depart; and place upon his head the crown. Go, and bring Phorbas hither: bid him, friends, Appear with honest confidence before me. 'Tis fit, and justice prompts me to bestow Some small memorial of my bounty on him; 'Tis fit at least, that as a sovereign ought, I should resign my throne. Before me, likewise, Bring the Corinthian stranger. You remain. SCENE II. OEDIPUS, ARASPES, ICARUS, ATTENDANTS. OEDIPUS. Hah! Is it thou, my Icarus! Sage friend, And guardian of my childhood! High in love, And just esteem with Polybus my father! On what important errand dost thou visit The Theban borders? ICARUS. Polybus is dead. OEDIPUS. What say'st thou? Hah! My father! ICARUS. 'Tis a loss Thou could'st not but expect. Worn out by age He sunk to his dark tomb; he had fulfil'd His sum of years; these eyes beheld his death. OEDIPUS. Where are ye now, fallacious oracles! The boasted voice of heaven! Who shock'd my virtue Too easily alarm'd! Ye, who prepared For this devoted heart each conscious pang Of horror, which the murtherer only knows! My father hath discharged the debt of nature; Deceivers as ye are, he rests in peace Among the dead. Spite of your vain predictions, These hands of mine are guiltless of his blood, And unpolluted. Thus to my false fears A voluntary slave, with anxious care Employ'd a fancy'd evil to remove, I have delivered up my life a prey To real misery; of my own sad fate The fond and credulous artificer. All-viewing Heaven! What woe superlative Must mine then be, if stern necessity Makes my repose dependent on the fate Of those so dear? If finding in their loss A joy detested, e'en a father's death I deem a gracious favour of the gods Conferr'd upon me! Let us hence; the time Demands our speed, and duty bids me haste To pay the funeral tribute to his ashes, Which they so justly claim. Let us away. No answer! Hah! and thy eyes fill'd with tears! What from this silenceâ ICARUS. Oh, immortal powers! How can I dare to speak? OEDIPUS. Dost thou reserve Evils behind, which I am yet to learn? ICARUS. Without a witness, grant me for a moment Thy listening ear. OEDIPUS. Go ye; awhile retire. [To the Attendants. What means he to unfold! ICARUS. No more must Corinth Thy thoughts engage; if seen within its walls, Thy death is certain. OEDIPUS. To my own domain, Say, who my entrance shall oppose? ICARUS. The sceptre Of Polybus, another now inherits. OEDIPUS. Is then the number perfect! And this stroke The last!âNo; still, imperious Fate, persist! Add to the weight! my firm sustaining soul Thou shalt not overcome.âHah! It is wellâ I go to reign. Haste, Icarus, away, To mix in mortal fight! I fly to meet, To shew their king to my degenerate subjects. Wielding, perhaps, amid the caitiff crew So eager to rebel, the vengeful sword, I may at least obtain a death of honour. Dying in Thebes, a criminal expires: But as a monarch ought, 'tis mine to die. Who have conspired against me? Say, what stranger Is seated on my throne? ICARUS. The son-in-law Of Polybus, who placed with his own hands, In the last hours of life, upon his brow The royal diadem; while all the people To their new master bent the willing knee. OEDIPUS. Can it be possible! My father likewise, Hath he betray'd me! Join'd in this rebellion, And chased me from the throne! ICARUS. He did thee justice; For thou wert not his son. OEDIPUS. Hah! Icarus! ICARUS. With sad reluctance, and with trembling heart, Shall I disclose this secret to thy ear; Much will it shock thee: but necessity At length demands that thou should'st be inform'd; And all the realm of Corinthâ OEDIPUS. Not his son! ICARUS. No: and the king himself with dying voice, By deep remorse oppress'd, to all declared it. Whilst I his secret counsellor and accomplice, Fearing the new-raised king would punish me With justice most severe, am hither come Imploring thy protection. OEDIPUS. Not his son! Great gods! Who then am I? ICARUS. Heaven, who consign'd Thy infant weakness to my fostering care, Conceal'd thy origin in deepest night. I only know, that from thy birth condemn'd, And on a barren mountain doom'd to perish, Without my aid, the chearful beams of day Would have been ravish'd from thy sight for ever. OEDIPUS. Thus were my woes coeval with my life. I was my parent's horror from my cradle. Where didst thou find me, outcast, and forlorn? ICARUS. On mount CithÃ¦ron. OEDIPUS. Near this place? ICARUS. A Theban, Who call'd himself thy father, in those wild And dreary haunts of solitude, exposed Thy tender frame. By some benignant god My steps were t'ward thee guided; in my breast Compassion reign'd, I took thee in my arms, Kindled anew thy warmth almost extinct, Gave thee to live, and bore thee strait to Corinth. There to the king presented, (with amaze Thy destiny contemplate!) He instead Of his departed child, adopted thee; And by that fortunately-skilful stroke Of policy, fix'd firm his doubtful power. Acknowledged as his son, thou wert brought up By the same hands which had before preserved thee. But ne'er hadst thou a title to the throne; Interest received thee, and remorse expell'd. OEDIPUS. Oh, ye, who o'er the fate of kings preside, Gods! was it then decreed by you, so oft In this dread day to sink me prone to earth! And by your oracles, with treachery fraught, Preparing each dire blow, that ye should thus Exhaust your store of miracles against One feeble helpless mortal!âBut inform me, Say, that old man who gave me to thy arms, Hast thou ne'er since that fatal hour beheld him? ICARUS. Never; and Death, perhaps, hath snatch'd away Him, who alone could have reveal'd to thee Whence thou derivest thy birth. But to my mind So oft his features have recurr'd, so strong Bears it his image still impress'd, no doubt, Could I behold him, I should know him well. OEDIPUS. Unhappy! Why this knowledge should I seek? Much rather ought I to assist the gods, And multiply the folds of that kind veil, Whose darkness shades my sight. I view my fate. These dire researches only would disclose New scenes of horror. Conscious of the future, Spite of the evils I foresee, desire, Curious desire, hurries my soul along Far from itself. I can no more remain In this uncertainty; in my sad state, Doubt is a torment piercingly severe. I hate the torch whose light I wish to guide My footsteps onward: dread to know myself; Yet cannot bear to live in ignorance. SCENE III. OEDIPUS, ICARUS, PHORBAS. OEDIPUS. Phorbas, come hither. ICARUS. Wonderful event! The more I gaze, the moreâHah! It is he, 'Tis he himself. PHORBAS to Icarus. Forgive me, if unknown Thy features.â ICARUS. Hast thou no remembrance then Of mount CithÃ¦ron? PHORBAS. What of that? ICARUS. The child Thou gavest me there.âThe infant whom to deathâ PHORBAS. What say'st thou?âHah! and what remembrance prompting, Comest thou t'undo me? ICARUS. Reassume thy courage! Fear nothing; banish every vain alarm. This place affords no subject but for joy. That child was OEdipus. PHORBAS. Heaven strike thee dead With its pernicious light'nings! Wretch accurst! What hast thou said? ICARUS. Doubt not, my Lord; whate'er This Theban utters, he deliver'd thee Into my arms; thy fate is now disclosed; There stands thy father. OEDIPUS. Oh, fortune, which my labouring sense confounds! Oh, aggregated misery!âIf sprung [To Phorbas. From thee, Heaven surely ne'er would have permitted That I should spill thy blood. PHORBAS. Thou'rt not my son. OEDIPUS. Hah! not thy son!âYe gods!âAnd didst not thou Expose me when an infant? PHORBAS. Oh, my Lord! Quick let me fly thy presence; spare thyself This horrid converse. OEDIPUS. Phorbas, in the name Of all the powers above, reveal the whole, Hide not a tittle from me. PHORBAS. Oh! away! Far from thy children haste! far from the queen! OEDIPUS. Nay, to the pointâResistance is in vain. The infant, which by thee was doomed to death, [Pointing to Icarus. Didst thou not to his arms deliver him? PHORBAS. I did, I did; and would, alas! that hour Had been my last of life! OEDIPUS. Where was he born? PHORBAS. Thebes was his native place. OEDIPUS. And wert not thou His father? PHORBAS. Oh, my bleeding heart! Alas! He from a lineage more illustrious sprang, And more unfortunate. OEDIPUS. Now answer me; At once declare, who was he? PHORBAS , throwing himself at the feet of Ådipus. Oh, my lord, What would'st thou do? OEDIPUS. Answer my question fully; Speak, for I will be satisfied. PHORBAS. His motherâ His mother was Jocasta. ICARUS. Heavenly powers! Is this then the reward to pity due! And is my generous kindess thus repaid! OEDIPUS. I saw this ruin o'er my head impend, And fear'd its destin'd fall. ICARUS. My lordâ OEDIPUS. Away, Inhuman as ye are, and shun my sight! Tremble, lest ye the recompence receive For benefits so dreadful! Fly with speed From the tumultuous horrors, kept in store By you alone, to urge my soul to frenzy! Fly, e'er the weight of my vindictive arm Ye too severely feel, for having saved me. SCENE IV. OEDIPUS alone. Thus is the baneful oracle fulfill'd, Whose unavoidable effect my fear Hath hurried into birth. And I am stamp'd, By accidents most frightfully combined, With incest, and with parricide, though virtuous. Unhappy virtue! sad and barren name! By whose ideal dictates I have ruled A life which I detest? The gloomy fate Which reign'd at my nativity, thy force Could not resist; I fell into the snare, While struggling to avoid it. Dragg'd to crimes By some all-potent deity, who sunk Beneath my flying steps a gulph profound. And in my blindness, spite of all my care, All my endeavours, of an unknown power I was the slave, and passive instrument. These are my evil deeds! I know, alas! Of none beside; remorseless, cruel gods! These evil deeds are yours, yet on my head Descends your punishment severe. Where am I! What darkness covers with its horrid veil The radiant beams of day! What blood defiles Yon crimson'd walls! I see the furies stand! Each shakes her blazing torch! Avengers stern Of parricide! The lightnings flash around! They burst upon me! Hell discloses wide Its dreary realms! Oh, Laius! Oh, my father! Is it thy form which I behold! I see, I own the mortal wound which in thy side Bears witness 'gainst this guilty hand. Strike homeâ Revenge thyself on an abhorred monster; A monster who hath not withheld pollution And sacrilege from those who gave him birth! Come onward! Drag me to the dark abodes! I hasten to my punishmentâto fill The shades below with wonder and dismayâ ApproachâI follow thee. SCENE V. ÅDIPUS, JOCASTA, EGINA, CHORUS. JOCASTA. Oh, Oedipus, Speak comfort to my soul! thy lamentation, With dreadful accents, hath assail'd my ears, And new-born terrors rise; Oh, speak! dispel them! OEDIPUS. Earth, ope thy deep abyss, and swallow me! JOCASTA. What unforeseen misfortune now o'erwhelms thee? OEDIPUS. My crimes. JOCASTA. My lord! OEDIPUS. Away! begone, Jocasta! JOCASTA. Ah! cruel husband! OEDIPUS. Wretched as thou art! No more! What word was that which pass'd thy lips? Thy husband! banish from thy tongue for ever The shocking name; a name which makes us both Objects of detestation. JOCASTA. Hah! What say'st thou? OEDIPUS. It is wound upâThe horror of our fate At length is perfectâLaius was my fatherâ I am thy son. [Exit. FIRST PERSON OF THE CHORUS. Oh, unimagined crime! SECOND PERSON. Oh, day tremendous! ever to be mark'd First in the direful list! JOCASTA. Bear me away! Snatch me, Egina, from this place of terrors? EGINA. Oh, bitterness of grief! JOCASTA. If ills like these Have power t'affect thee; if unnerv'd by fear, Thou still canst give thy succouring hand; assist! Support! With pity view thy queen's distress! FIRST PERSON OF THE CHORUS. Gods! is it thus your hatred ends! Resume! Resume your fatal benefits! for know, Relentless powers, that we would rather choose To feel for ever your inflicted vengeance! SCENE VI. JOCASTA, EGINA, HIGH PRIEST, CHORUS. HIGH PRIEST. Inhabitants of Thebes! A happy calm Succeeds these tempests; a serener sun Beams o'er your heads; the pestilential fires No longer blaze; the yawning tombs are closed; Death flies; and heaven and earth's almighty sire Proclaims his goodness by the voice of thunder. [Thunder and lightning. JOCASTA. Why dart these flashes round me! Heaven! where am I? What do I hear?âBarbariansâ HIGH PRIEST. It is done. The gods are now appeased; Laius restrains His enmity, nor from the realms of death Stirs up revenge against thee; to possess The throne, to live he suffers thee, the blood Of Oedipus hath satisfied his wrath. CHORUS. Immortal powers! JOCASTA. Oh, my devoted son! Alas! and can I, dare I say my husband! Sad, dreadful union of these dearest names! Is he then dead? HIGH PRIEST. He lives; but by that fate Which still oppresses him, divided seems Both from the dead and living; his own hands, E'er he expires, have violated life. I saw him thrust into his eyes the sword Which with his father's blood was erst imbrued; He hath fulfill'd his melancholy lot. This destined hour gives the first sign to Thebes Of health and safety; thus the gods decree; Their anger rests in peace; they, at their will, Justice or mercy deal to man below. They have exhausted all their store of arrows On thy unhappy son. Live thou, Jocastaâ Thee they forgive. JOCASTA. I punish then myself. [Stabs herself. O'er-rul'd by some dire power; foredoom'd to incest; Death is my utmost wish, the only god To be invoked by me. Laius, receive My offered blood! Thy manes I pursue To the dark regions of the dead; my life Hath been to virtue sacred, and I die Without a conscious fear. CHORUS. Oh, hapless queen! Oh, destiny, which strikes my soul with horror! JOCASTA. Reserve your pity for my son alone, For he still treads the paths of hated life. Priests, and you, Thebans, who were once my subjects, Honour my funeral pile; and let your minds Bear witness ever, that oppressed by fate, And in the midst of its encircling horrors, I fix'd the stain of shame upon the gods, Whose powerful impulse forced me on to crimes.
