      <field name="fulltext">THE SAD ONE. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGVMENT Introducing to the following SCENES. Sicily had been a long time tormented with civil wars, and the Crown was still in dispute, till Aldebrand geting the upper hand in a set Battel, establish'd himself in the throne, and gave a period to all those troubles in shew only; for the old Factions were set on foot again shortly after, and the House of the Floretties and the Cleonaxes strove now as much who should be most powerful with the King, as before who should make him. In conclusion, the favor of Aldebrand inclining to the Cleonaxes, and by degrees resting wholly upon them, the Floretties took Arms, but in a set Field lost all; The Father and the Son being both taken prisoners, the one was banish'd, the other condemned suddenly to lose his head. Thus far the Author drew the curtain; the rest of the Plot is wrapt up in the following Scenes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Actors. AldebrandâKing of Sicily. Cleonax seniorâTreasurer. Cleonax juniorâHis Son. BellaminoâFavorite of Pleasure, and Cousin to Cleonax.

      <field name="fulltext">The Scene, SICILY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. ScÃ¦n. I. Enter old Clarimont in Prison, in his Night-gown, his Servant following him. Condemn'd unheard! Just heavens, it cannot be: Why, Tyranny it self could do no more; The pale ghosts of Tiberius and Nero Would blush to see an act so foul and horrid, So full of black ingratitude as this. 'Twas I that set the Crown upon his head, And bid him live King of his Enemies, When he durst hardly hope it: And does he thus requite me! Now I see, Who by the Compass of his Merit sails, May guide his Fraught of Hopes in seasons fair And calm; but when storms come, All his good deeds, with his good days, must perish: Oh my unhappy Stars!â [Beats his breast.] Ser. My Lord, let not a fruitless passion Make you to die less Man then you have lived. Clar. Who art thou? Ser. I was lately one, my Lord, Of the vast Crowd that waited on your fortunes, But am now become the whole Train, The rest have left you. Clar. Prethee do thou leave me too. [Servant exit.] The clap o'th' Vulgar, and loud popular applause, Are not the Eccho of our Acts, but Fortunes. Great men but Dials are, which when the Sun Is gone, or hides his face, are hardly lookt upon. But yesterday I was Times Minister; On me the whole Court gaz'd, as at Some Comet set in Cassopeia's chair: Who but old Clarimont could with Nodds create, And with a speaking Eye, command bare heads and knees? But nowâ [Beats his breast again.] Greatness is but the shadow of the beams Of Princes favors, nourisht in extreams; First taught to creep, and feed on hopes, to live Upon the glance, and humbly to observe Each Under-Minion, till its own desire Work it self neer enough to set it self on fire. [Studies a little.] Fain would I make my Audit up with Heaven, For 'tis a large one; but the small vain hopes Which yet I have of life and of revenge, Smother these thoughts within me Faster then they are born. Enter Fidelio disguised like a Friar. âA Ghostly Father! My minutes are but few, I see by this. Sir, you are welcom: I was but now considering how to die, And, trust me, I do find it something hard, I shall extreamly need some such good help As yours, to do it well. Fid. Faith, my Lord, Divines do hold, The way to die well, is to live well first. [Discovers himself.] Clar. Fidelio! Fid. Not too loud, there's danger in't: The King has promised life, but none as yet Must know't; the Enemies are too potent, And must be softned by degrees. Clar. Why then I see, he hath not quite forgot Past services. Fid. âNot too much of that: This is not gratitude; or if it be, it does As thankfulness in great ones use to do, It looks asquint and seems to turn to favors, But regards new ends. Clar. Prethee unriddle. Fid. Why to be short, it is your daughters beauty, Not your merit. Clar. My fears prompt me too quick; She's not turn'd whore, is she? Fid. No, but her honesty is so strait beset, That if she be not victualled well within And have some sudden succors, She will I fear ere long surrender. Clar. O Fidelio, when Kings do tempt, Th'had need be Angels that endure the shock, Not womenâ Fid. 'Tis true, my Lord, Yet let not uncertain fears create new griefs: Doubt is of all the sharpest passion, And often turns distempers to diseases: Collect your self, and be assur'd my zeal Shall watch abroad; and when I may reveal My self your servant, I'll not do't in breath, But with the adventure of my life or death. Clar. Oh you are noble, Sir, I know't, And mean to hope the best, Farewell. Exeunt. Enter Lorenzo and his Father with servants, whispering together and frowning, pass over the Stage, Exeunt. Enter Lorenzo solus, as going to Prison. Arm'd with the love of soveraignty and revenge, Ile ravish Fortune and all Engines trie That heaven or hell have yet discovered, But I will scale my end, and plant desire As high as any thought durst ere aspire: The dotage of the King shall not secure thee, poor old man; Clarimont, I come; this night our quarrel ends, Nothing but death could ever make us friends. [Knocks at the Prison-door.] Enter the Keeper. Where's old Clarimont? Keep. In's bed, my Lord. Lor. In's grave, thou wouldst have said. Keep. Must he then die to night? Lor. The King will have it so, He fears the people love him, and to save His life may prove tumultuous. Keep. Poor Gentleman! how quick is Fate come on him! âHow sudden is all woe! Bad days have wings, the good on crutches go. My Lord, wilt please you walk into that private chamber? The Executioner shall strait be here. [Lorenzo goes forth, murders him within, enters again.] Lor. You must be sure to keep it secret now: Perchance the King, to try your honesty, And blind his daughters eyes, will send to ask Of's welfare. Keep. Oh my Lord! Lor. Nay I know you understand, Farewell. [Turns back again.] One thing I had forgot: If any ask What groan that was, say 'tis an usual thing Against great mens death to hear a noise At midnightâ So, now Royal Letcher set you safe, 'Tis your death must secure my life: I'le on, Danger is but a bug-word, My Barque shall through, Did mountains of black horrors me surround, âWhen Fortunes hang in doubt, Bravely to dare, is bravely to get out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. ScÃ¦n. 1. Lorenzo, Parmenio attending. All leave the chamber; if any come, I'm busie. Parmenio, be nigher, nigher yet: What dar'st thou do to make thy Master King, Thy self a Favorite? Par. 'Tis something blunt, my Lord, [Studies] Why, I dare doâ That which I dare not speak. Lor. By all my hopes, spoke like the man I want! 'Twould be lost time to use much circumstance To thee: shall we this night dispatch the King? Par. This minute, were he my Father; He's not the first, nor shall he be the last. Lor. Soul of my soul! My better Angel sure Foresaw my wants, and sent thee hither. Parmenio, there's none but he Stands 'twixt a Crown and me: The Cloud that interpos'd betwixt my Hopes before, Is like a Vapor faln, and seen no more. The house of Clarimont is lost, The King has sent one Son to banishment, And I have sent the Father. Par. How Sir!âYou have not murdered him! [Starts] Lor. Why? Par. Nothing my Lord, onely I'm sorry I had no hand in't. S'death, hath the villain killed him? [Aside.] Lor. Oh thou art jealous, Thy hand comes well enough; this night I have determined that soon, ere The Royal Bloods atilt, you shall to horse, 'Tis easie to out-rideâ Par. Imagination it self, my Lord. Lor. For then report will say thou kildst him. No matterâ Par. Oh none at all my Lord. Lor. When I am King, I can restore at ease. Par. True my Lord. What if your Excellence cast out when I'm gone, That Clarimonts yongest son did this, and took His flight upon't. His discontent's known well enough To make of a Suspition a most received Truth; Besides, wheresoev'r I go, I'll swear 'twas he. Lor. By Jove most rare, when I am King I shall Be poorer then I am, by giving thee Thy due: Away, let's lose no time in words, We're both resolv'd to put this cause to swords: I'le to the King; thou to prepare for night, Four hours hence wait me in the gallery. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 2. Enter Clarimont solus. Break heart and burst! My Father murdered, And in the midst of all his hopes of life! Methinks I see millions of Furies stand Ready to catch my Rages sacrifice: O for a man that could invent more plagues Then hell could holdâ I have conceiv'd of wrong, and am grown great Already: O sweet Revenge! I humbly thee intreat Be my Griefs midwife; let the mother die, So thou bringst forth her long'd for progenie. Methinks I feel the Villain grow within me, And spread through all my veins: How I could murder now, poison, or stab! My head is full of mischief, sulphur and flaming pitch Shall be but mercy to those deaths I'le give. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 3. Enter the King, Fidelio. Fidel. Though it be not safe for Subjects To prie into the secrets of their Prince, Much less to question about them, Yet the implicite faith of blind obedience, Poison'd with pleasing oftâ Fid. And't like Your Majesty, why do you court this Lady thus? King. Why dost thou ask? Fid. I know 'tis insolence to make reply, Yet hear me as the eccho of the Court, great Sir, They call your last giv'n mercy, and those favors But fairer ends to Lust. King. Thy zeal hath got thy pardon: (Stares upon him.) No more, he that does offer to give direction To his Prince, is full of pride, not of discretion. Exit. Fid. So, to give Kings good advice, May shew, I see, men faithful, but not wise: I'm honest yet, and I do fare the worse for't, Oh the Court!â There humors reign, and merits only serve To mock with idle hopes those best deserve. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 4. Enter Francelia, Bellamino. Franc. Sir, leave your complement; Methinks the sweetest speech is that that's meant. Bell. Wrong not my Love, best Creature, so, to think My words are not the true ambassadors Of my heart; by thy fair self I swear, Nature has been too partial In robbing heaven and earth to give you all. Franc. Their weaknesses you mean, and I confess my Lordâ Bell. Their richest graces, sweetest, Oh do not rack me thus: I love, can you give love again? Franc. Yes, any love that you dare ask, Or I dare give, my Lord. Bell. Oh but, fair Lady, Love must have no bounds, It pines in prison. Franc. Oh but, my Lord, hot Loves, if not contained, Like fiery meteors, promise no good to others, And are themselves consum'd. (Enter the King and Lords attend.) Bell. O leave me not in doubts distracting trance. King. How, my boy, what, courting! Bell. No, Sir. King. What was he doing then, Francelia? Franc. So please your Grace, he was ith' midst Of all your praises, when your Highness entred. Bell. Humâ There's yet some hope then. (Aside.) King. Oh you are glad we are come then! That discourse was tedious. Franc. No, my Lord, I should have been well pleased To have heard him longer. King. You are grown a Courtier, Fair one! Sileo, are the Coaches ready? Sil. Yes and't please your Majesty. King. Come, we'll abroad then, This day invites us forth; where's our Queen? Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 5. Enter Clarimont, Fidelio, Young Florelio. Clar. âThen with a pause fill'd up with sighs, Ask him how strong his Guards are; but above all, Be sure t'apply inflaming Corrosives, Scrue up his anger to the height, And make his fears be double: Officious friends and mediation May else prove remedies. Fid. Enough; If we do fail to act Our parts to th' life in's tragedy, May all those horrors that do threaten him Fall upon us, Farewell. Exeunt. Clar. So, my revenge flies high: The Vilain first shall kill his Father, And while his hands are hot ith' blood, This sword shall pierce him. âMurdered he shall sink quick to hell, I will not give him leave t'unload himself Of one poor single sin of thought: But lest he should wake out Of's great security, and shun his fate, I will rock him onâ Mischiefs are like the Cockatrices eye, If they see first, they kill; if seen, they dye. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter King, young Florelio, Fidelio. King. And must the Vilain kill me too? Flor. This very night. King. Why 'tis not possible, what would he have had more? He had my heart, and might have had All but the name of King: Oh, heaven had tyed So strict a friendship, we could not part with't; I durst have thought that I had merited Fidelity from him. Fid. O my Lord, let ne'r so many drops Sweet as the morning-dew fall on the sea, The brinish water turns them all to salt: Where there's an ocean of ingratitude, Favors must needs be lost. King. Thou speak'st but truth; Who does to merit trust, But writes an obligation in the dust. Your councels now my faithful life preserve, Is there a way for pardon? Fid. Faith Sir, it would pollute mercy to use it here; The fact's so foul, it calls it self for death. King. And it shall have it: Traitor's enough; but when Ungrateful comes, It stops the mouth of pity: Go take our guards And apprehend him straight. Flor. Soft great Sir, 'Twere fit your Justice should consider What way is made, if you shall apprehend him, For Treason unborn, and which he only did intend: Foolish report which never was ith' right, May clear his guiltiness, and censure Majesty. If youl'd permit him to approach the Chamber, (Yet who'ld advise Treason should come so near?) You would take him in the act, And leave no place for foul suspition: Then if your Grace sent for his father, And kept him with pretence of business by you, Till he became the witness of the attempt, Envy it self could have no cause to bark. King. Thou art my Oracle; I cannot tell Whether my debt be greater to thy faith, Or to thy councel: Go and watch abroad, And let these cares wait upon fate and me. The Captain of the Guard 'twere fit you sounded, He may do mischief: Florelio, you Shal to his father, the rest is mine to manage. Exeunt. These men are honest, and must be rewarded, They do deserve it; 'tis most rare to find A Greatness that enjoys true friends: For commonly it makes us fear'd and hated; The one doth breed offence, th'other leaves naked. Let the impartial eye but look upon All we call ours, and then again behold The many hungry eyes of expectation That wait upon our bounty, and it shall find That we have scarce enough to keep mens hopes up, We are rich if we can purchase friends: Thrones, though they advance their glory ne'r so high, Are but the seats of fear and misery. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 2. Enter Parmenio, Lorenzo. Par. In deep security, my Lord, The Lady's at one window courted; The King with Florelio and the Favorite Contriving of a Masque, which he must never see. Lor. Good! which he must never see. Oh thou dost hug my Fates: How I am ravisht to think upon Ensuing joys!â Parmenio, he's dead already. Par. Six hours ago, my Lord, you cannot think How much ado I had to keep my self From saying, And't shall please your Majesty, Ith' open presence to you: Methinks one while I see your Highness sit Like Jupiter in state, With all the petty gods about you; And then again in a more tempting shape Then was the shower of gold, Lie in some Danae's lap More wanton then Europa's Bull; Another time with some great train, As if you went to battel, Rockt in a douny coach, go take the air, And have the thronging City Crowded into a handfull, Looking along to bless your eyes, And striving who shall cry loudest, God bless your Majesty! Lor. And all the while thou, like my Ganimede, Shalt taste Ambrosia with me, while the petty gods Burst with repining at thy happiness: Thou shalt dispose of all, create, displace, Be call'd my Boy, revel and mask, what not? Oh, for one half year I will not speak unto the people, Take you that office, keep that part for yours. Oh how I long for night! Thou canst not name the pleasure Could make the time not tedious. Away unto thy watch, and when the King's abed, Be here. Par. I shall, my Lord, And't please your Majesty, I shall. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 3. Enter the Queen Amasia, Bellamino her Favorite, Drollio Attendants. Bell. What is the matter, Madam, that the Court Is in such clouds to night? The King Feigns mirth and freeness, but withall Flashes of fury make escapes. Q. 'Tis strange, my Lord, you should not know. Bell. Faith Madam, I know nothing. Q. Troth nor I, but I suspect: The clock no sooner struck, but all the Statesmen Started, as if they had been to run a race, And the King told me 'twere fit I took my rest: There's something in't; but these designs of State We women know no more then our own fate. To turn our talk, Faith my Lord, where lies That Beauty that so captivates you all? She has a graceful garb, 'tis true. Bell. Who, Madam, Francelia? Oh she has a dainty foot, And daintier hand, an eye round as a globe And black as jet, so full of majesty and life, That when it most denies, it most invites. Q. These parts she has indeed, but is here all? Bell. All! heaven forbid: Her hair's so preciously fair and soft, That were she faln into some river and In danger, one would make a conscience To save her life, for fear of spoiling it. Her lips are gently swelled like unto Some blushing cherry, that hath newly tasted The dew from heaven; and her cheeksâ Q. Hold, hold my Lord, all this is Poetry, A Painter could not flatter more: To my eye now she is so slender, She's scarce, I think, a span about ith' middle. Bell. Oh, Madam, you must think wise Nature Of such rich mould as she was framed Would make as little waste as could be. Q. So, so, What think you of the upper part o'th' nose then; Does it not look as if it did give way The eyes should shortly have an interview? Bell. You're too severe a Critick, Madam; So good a wit as yours could make, Where there were any, all blest perfections. After all, next to your Highness, I'm resolved to think She is chiefest Beauty. Q. Not next to me, my Lord, now I am sure you flatter, But 'tis too late to chide you for it, Goodnightâ Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 4. Enter the King going to bed, Cleonax, Lords, Attendants. King. God night to all. Lord Cleonax, a word in private; [Whisper] Take away the lights and shut the door. Exeunt. Enter Parmenio and Lorenzo. Lor. Is the King gone to bed? Par. An hour ago, my Lord. Lor. What if he should not be asleep yet? Par. No matter; ere his tongue can speak, our swords Shall kill: What though he call us Traitors? 'Twill be his last, and may be pardoned. Come Sir, bravely on! âFear's worse then death, You're Lord of all, or not of your own breath. Lor. Nay if I fear, may I not live. Followâ The King calls out Treason! Old Cleonax rising to go out-at the door to call for help, is met by his son, who took him for the King and kill'd him: Lorenzo is presently of set purpose run through by Parmenio. ScÃ¦n. 5. Enter the King in his Night-gown, Lords, Attendants. King. Trust me, most sad and strange! A flood of grief beats at my eyes for vent: Poor Cleonax, I'm truly sorry for thee. Lords. So are we all. King. This accident commands our pity, But what is done, is done: Let it not be as yet divulged; Remove the corps, and let it be the care Of thee, Florelio, to see his burial Honorable and private.â Good thanks to all the rest, Clarimont, stay you with me. Exeunt. The Traitor's dead by Parmenio; but you must know, There's one yet lives within me, I love, Clarimont. Clar. That passion of all others, Sir, heaven easiliest pardons; He lives not sure, that loves not. King. I, but my Love's not pure, 'Tis great, not good, Clarimont, I loveâFrancelia. Clar. Take heed of unchaste fires, great Sir, They mischief Sir; Forget her, faith forget her: Such fits as these are ever cur'd like Agues, Best when they are most starved: If you shall give them their desired fuel, They'l not be quencht with ease, and it is ever seen (Heaven keep my Soveraign!) The house they're bred in, feels them first and ever. King. Clarimont, thou wert ne'r in Love; Thou art Philosophical, and wouldst have Reason Guide where it was never yet Companion: Thou shewst thy want of Love, But helpst not mine: Councel is now too late, It's like Smiths water flung upon the coals Which more inflames, hereâ Thou twice hast sav'd my life, if thou now speed'st; Go to Francelia, and present This Jewel to her, and withall my Love, (Gives him a Jewel) Do't with thy best of language and respect: Fair means at first we'll use, But foul shall come, if she the fair refuse: Good night, and good success. Exit. Clar. Obedience is the best of what I am, Your will's my Law, Sir. Clarimont solus. âWhy then it must be: Was there no woman in the Court To feed thy lust with, but my sister, And none to be the Bawd but I? Couldst thou not think of any other way To express thy greatness, but by doing me wrong? My fathers angry ghost, I see, Is not full appeased yet: (Studies) Why should I make, of murther thus begun, A massacre?â He did my father right in his revenge; I, but he wrong'd him first; and yet who knows But it was justice to attempt by force? The removal of great Favorites, though enemies to th' State, Is not so warrantableâI'm in a maze: Something I'll do, but what I cannot tell, I fear the worst, Lust never ended well. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Francelia and Bellamino. Franc. Fie, leave this importunity, my Lord, I shall yield else, by this kiss I shall. Bell. By this, and this, and this, thou shalt: Heavens, what a breath is here! Thy father fed on musk and amber When he begot thee, sure; the wanton air Chaf'd by the hot scents of Arabick spices Is nothing nigh so sweet; the Ambrosia The Gods themselves were drunk with, Dwells on thy lips. (Enter Florelio senior.) Franc. Come, come, you flatter, 'Tis on yours, my Lord. Bell. On mine! alas, Nature gave us the prickles, You the roses, but meant that they should grow together. [Kisses again.] Franc. So, so, what if the King or Florelio saw ye? Bell. What if they did? I can fear nothing now But surfeits: Come, we lose time, my Fairest, Do we not? this is the minuteâ [Kisses her again] Flor. By heaven this is not fair, Madam. Franc. Wonder strikes me dumb. Exit. Flor. How does she kiss, Favorite? Bell. Who, my Lord? Flor. My wife, my Lord: draw, draw, or by all my hopes, My rage will make me turn a murderer. Bell. Not so easilyâ [They fight] Flor. Hold, let's breathe: Why should I do him right, Who has done me such wrong? or die for her That will not live for meâ [Puts up] Go enjoy herâ [Offers to go out] Bell. Softâ [Pulls him back] You have stolne a secret here That you must give again, or take my lifeâdraw. Flor. Prethee disturb me not. Bell. No, unless you promise never to disclose What you have here discover'd, This must be the passage. [Stands betwixt the door and him.] Flor. Hum! I will be mute, credit me, I will not speak one word. [Offers to go out again] Bell. Nayâ [Pulls him back] You must swear it too. Flor. If I must, I must.âBy heaven And by my honorâHow tame a thing A Cuckold is!â Exit. Bell. S'death, why did I let him go? We can no more subsist together Then fire and waterâ âOne of us two must die; And charity tells me, better he then I. But how? it is not for my honor To kill him baselyâ (Studies) Nor is it for hers to kill him otherwise; The whole Court will ghess the quarrel, If it be a Duelâ (Studies again) It is decreed; No matter which way, so he fall: Mine, in respect of hers, are no respects at all. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 2. Enter Docodisapio, Drollio. Doc. Abused, grossly abused! a base affront, Believe it Drollio. Droll. Why, what's the matter, Signior? Doc. Why, do you hear nothing? Droll. No, why what should it be? Doc. Pisaro is the man. Droll. Fie, fie, it cannot be; The State could not commit so great an oversight, Neglect a man of merit for Pisaro, fie, fie! Doc. Want of judgment, Drollio; An unlearned Council, I ever told you so, Never more heads, nor never less wit, believe't. Droll. Say you so, Seignior, that's hard: What say you to Diano? Doc. Alas an ordinary Brain, Talks and talks it's true, But speaks more then he is, believe't, Betwixt you and I a meer pratler. There's Falorio too; why, he cannot read his own hand; Vasquez cannot speak sence without two days Premeditation, Sillio, Vechio, Caronnio, All Stones in their Headâ Droll. If I should tell these Lords now, Seignior, What you say, it might cost an Eareorso. Doc. I, why there's another abuse i'th' State, A man shall have his ears cut off for speaking A truth. A sick Government, Drollio, And a weak one believe't; it never thrived Since Spain and we grew so great. There's a mystery in that too, Drollio. I will know all, before they have any more of my money. Doll. Peace Seignior, the King. Exeunt. Enter the King, Queen, Lords, an Ambassador from Spain, who has his Audience; after which the King goes out talking with Fidelio, the rest follow. Then enters the two Brothers, the Florellies, the elder speaks earnestly. Fl. S. I prethee leave me, by all that's good Thou canst not know it, why shouldst thou thus In vain torment thy self and me. (They whisper. Fl. j. Well, I ghess, and 'tis enough. Exit. [The elder Florelio goes out at another door.] ScÃ¦n. 3. Enter Clarimont, Francelia. Franc. Think not, good Sir, your elegant inforcements Can seduce my weaker innocence; it's a resolution grounded, And sooner shall the fixed Orbs be lifted off their hinges, Then I be mov'd to any act That bears the name of foul: You know the way you came, Sir. Clar. Is this all the respect the King shall have? No, you would do well to clothe this harsh denial In better language. Franc. You may please to say, I owe my life unto my Soveraign, And should be proud to pay it in At any warning, were it nere so short: But for my Chastity, it doth so much concern another, I can by no means part with it: So fare you well Sirâ Exit. Clar. By heaven a Saint, no woman; Sure she was born o'th vertues of her Mother, Not of her Nieces; the whole sexe May come to be thought well of for her sake. I long to meet Florelio; my joy is not compleat Till I have cured his jealousies as well as mine. Exit. Enter Florelio, and a Boy. Flor. There was a time when Snakes and Adders had no being, When the poor Infant-world had no worse reptiles Then were the Melon and the Strawberry: Those were the golden times of Innocence, There were no Kings then, nor no lustful Peers, No smooth-fac'd Favorites, nor no Cuckolds sure. Oh!âhow happy is that man, whose humbler thoughts Kept him from Court, who never yet was taught The glorious way unto damnation; Who never did aspire Further then the cool shades of quiet rest, How have the heavens his lower wishes blest! Sleep makes his labors sweet, and innocence Does his mean fortunes truly recompence: He feels no hot Loves, nor no Palsie-fears, No fits of filthy Lusts, or of pale Jealousies: He wants, it's true, our clothes, our masks, our diet, And wants our cares, our fears, and our disquiets. But this is all but raving, And does distemper more; I'le sleep: [Lies all along on the ground.] Boy, sing the Song I gave you. A Song to a Lute. [Boy] Hast thou seen the Doun ith' air when wanton blasts have tost it; Or the Ship on the Sea, when ruder waves have crost it? Hast thou markt the Crocodiles weeping, or the Foxes sleeping? Or hast view'd the Peacock in his pride, or the Dove by his Bride, when he courts for his leachery? Oh so fickle, oh so vain, oh so false, so false is she! [Flor.] Good Boy, leave me! (Boy exit.) Enter Clarimont. Clar. How now Florellio, Melancholy? Flor. No, I was studying, prethee resolve me Whether it be better to maintain A strong implicit faith, That can by no means be opprest; Or falling to the bottom at the first, Arm'd with disdain and with contempts, to scorn the worst? Clar. This is a subtile one; but why studying about this? Flor. Faith, I would find a good receipt for the head-ach, That's all.â Clar. Hum, I know now whereabouts you are; No more on't, I'm come to clear those doubts, Your wife is chaste, chaste as the Turtle-dove. Flor. Ha, ha, ha! Clar. Ha, why do you laugh? I know she is, 'tis not So many hours, since I tempted her with all my eloquence, And for the King, yet found her cold as ice. Flor. Ha, ha, ha! Clar. You do not well to tempt a Friend, You do forget she is my sister. Flor. I would I nere had known you had one. Clar. You'll give a reason now for this. Flor. None. Clar. By all that's good, since our dear father left us, We are become his scorn; look you Sir, [Draws] I dare maintain it. Flor. But I dare not; put up, put up, young man, When thou hast known a woman, thou wilt be tamer. Exit. Clar. Ha! what should this mean? I know he's valiant, wise, discreet: and what of that? Passion, when it hath got the bit, doth oft-times throw the Rider: âYet why should I be peremptory? She may, for ought I know, be yet unchaste With some unworthy Groom. [Studies] What if I stole into some corner, and heard her at Confession? 'Twould not be amissâ For souls, at such a time, like ships in tempests Throw out all they have. And now I think on't, Her trial shall be quick: Friend I'll do thee right, Come on't what will, she dies if she be light. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 4. Enter Signior Multecarni the Poet, and two of the Actors. Mul. Well, if there be no remedy, one must act two parts; Rosselio shall be the Fool and the Lord, And Tisso the Citizen and the Cuckold. 1 Act. That cannot be, Signior, you know, One still comes in, when the other goes out. Mul. By Jove 'tis true; let me see, We'll contrive it, the Lord and the Usurer, The Citizen and the Polititian; And sure they never are together. But who shall act the Honest Lawyer? 'Tis a hard part, that. 2 Act. And a tedious one, It's admired you would put it in, Squire; And 'tis against your own rules, To represent any thing on the Stage, That cannot be. Mul. Why, dost think 'tis impossible for a Lawyer to be honest? 1 Act. As 'tis for a Lord Treasurer to be poor, Or for a King not to be cozened. There's little Robin, in debt within these three years, Grown fat and full by the trade: And then there's Borachio, an unknown man, Got it all by speaking loud and bawling: Believe it, Signior, they have no more conscience Then an Inn-keeper.â Mul. I grant you all this; An old Cook, and a good, will please all palates: There's that for the young Tapers of the Law; Then there's a bawdy Jest or two Extraordinary for the Ladies; And when it comes to be acted in private, I'll have a jerk at the State For the Country-Gentlemen: If it does not take, My masters, it lies not upon me, I have provided well; And if the stomack of the times be naught, The fault's not in the meat or in the Cook. Come, let's find out Lepido And dine at the Mermaidâ Come let us have one Rowse, my Joves, in Aristippus, We shall conceive the better afterwards. Act. Agreed, agreedâ [Exeunt singing] Come, come away, to the Tavern I say, For now at home is Washing-day: Leave your prittle-prattle, let's have a Pottle, We are not so wise as Aristotle. ScÃ¦n. 5. Enter Clarimont, Florelio. Clar. By heaven she's false, false as the tears of Crocodiles, Or what is yet more feign'd: I do confess, Your pardon, Florelio, come pray your pardon, Perchance I may deserve it. Flor. You have it, so has she; would heaven would do it as easily as I. Clar. Heaven cannot do so foul an act, She hasâoh, she has done too much! And should not I see justice done, The gods would punish me. Brother, clear up, The world shall not be one day elder Ere I see thy injuries revenged: This night the King will revel And be gamesom; he will change beds with thee, Deny him not, and leave the rest to me. Flor. Thy youth I see doth put thee on too fast, Thou hast too much of passion, gentle brother: Thinkst thou the death of a poor lustful King Or Peer can give me ease? No, for if it could, my hand durst go as far that way As thineâ Had she been chaste, there had no tempters bin, Or if there had, I had not thought it sin. Draw not thy sword at all, I do beseech thee, 'Twill not deserve one drop of Noble blood; Forget it, do, for my sake.â Clar. May heaven forget me then! Where is the courage of thy house become? When didst thou cease to be thy self? Shall two brave Families be wrong'd, Most basely wrong'dâ And shall we tamely like Philosophers Dispute it without reasons? First may I live the scorn of all the world, Then die forgotten.âNo, no: Were there as many Actors in thy wrong, As does the vast Stage of the world now bear, Not one should scape my rage, I and my ghost Would persecute them all. By all our ties of Love, of Brother, Friend, By what thou holdst most dear, I do conjure thee To leave this work to me; And if ere thou canst think That I present thee not a full revenge, Then take it out on me. Flor. Thy zeal hath overcome me, What wouldst thou have me do? Clar. Nothing but this; Obey the King in all He shall desire, and let your servants be at my dispose This night; one of your faithfull'st Confidents Send hither presently. Flor. Well I shall; but what you'l do, heaven knows, I know not, nor will I:â It is enough that I, against my will, Am made a passive instrument of ill. Farewellâ. Exit. Clar. So, there is but this, The wanton King this night thinks to embrace My sister; his bed shall prove his grave, His own Favorite shall make it so: I have perswaded him she yields, And this night doth expect him: He, to make sure oth' Husband, By my advice, as if he did intend Some jest, means to change lodgings With wrong'd Florelio, the Favorite.â Enter Petruchio. Oh Petruchio, welcom! You have other clothes, These I should borrow for a little while, In Masquing times Disguises are in fashion: I have a pretty plot in hand, and if it take, 'Twill be some Crowns in thy way. Petr. I shall pray hard it may, Sir, My Clothes howsoever are at your service. Clar. And I at yours, Petruchio; But you must be dumb And secret now. Pet. As any Statue, Sir. Clar. Come then, let's about it. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Lepido, Drollio. Droll. A rare Masque no doubt, who contriv'd it? Lep. Marry he that says 'tis good, howsoere he has made it, Signior Multecarni. Droll. Who, the Poet Laureat? Lep. The same. Droll. Oh then 'twere blasphemy to speak against it: What, are we full of Cupids? Do we sail upon the vast, and resail, And fetch the Masque from the clouds? Lep. Away Critick, thou never understoodst him. Droll. Troth I confess it; but my comfort is, Others are troubled with the same disease, 'Tis epidemical, Lepido, take't on my word, And so let's in, and see how things go forward. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 2. Enter Francelia sola weeping. Swell on my griefs, and O ye gentler tears Drop still, and never cease to fall Till you become a boundless Ocean; Then drown the source that sent you out, and hide Francelia from her husbands sight, Her wronged husbands: Oh could my Florelio but see How all hot flames within me are gone forth, Sure he would love again: Yet sure he would not: Heavens! how just you are, And oh how wicked I am! My heart beats thick as if my end were nigh, And would it were! a better time death Cannot take; an Absolution I have had, And have confest my unchaste Love Unto my ghostly Father; my peace is made above, But here belowâWhat mak'st thou here Petruchio?â (Enter Clarimont like to Petruchio.) Clar. She weeps, the whore repents perchance: Madam, it is my Masters pleasure that this night You keep your chamber. Franc. Thy voice and countenance are not the same, They tell me that thy Master is displeas'd. Clar. Madam, it may be so; but that to me Is as unknown as is the new-found world, I am his servant and obey commands. Franc. And so am I, I prethee tell him so, I will not stir.â Exit. Clar. How cunning is the Devil in a Womans shape! He had almost again perswaded me To have become her brother. Enter Servant. Ser. Petruchio the Favorite is lighted at the door, And asks to see my Lady. Clar. My Lady is retired, where is he? This to my hearts desire falls out. Enter Bellamino the Favorite. Bell. Where's Francelia? Clar. My Lord, she is not well, And craves your Lordships pardon. Bell. What, sick upon a Masque-night, And when the King sends for her! Come, come, that must not be; Which way is she? [Clarimont steps to him and whispers.] Bell. By heavenâ [He starts.] Clar. By heaven, nor will she ever see you more, if heâ Bell. I understand you, I am Bellamino; If ere he see the morning, I had decreed it, nor should he have surviv'd Three days, had he been nere so silent: This night's his last, Petruchio, This arm shall make it so, I will not trust my brother with the act. Clar. Nobly resolv'd; but how, or where, my Lord? Bell. No matter where; rather then fail, I'll make the Presence-chamber be The place of execution. Clar. Still nobly, but my Lordâ Bell. But again, Petruchio. Clar. âAnd again, my Lord, why Think you that Petruchio, when he is Entrusted in a business, will not see It rightly done, and for his Ladies honor? You'll kill him, and in publick, then forsooth When you're ith' saddle, all the Court shall cry Francelia was weary of her husband: No, no, my Lady loves you well, But loves her honor too; and there are ways, I hope, To keep the one, and yet not lose the other: Do not I know my Lady lies alone, And will feign herself sick this night, And all on purpose too? am not I to let you Into her chamber, and to give out, the fact once done, That he killed himself.â FINIS.</field>
