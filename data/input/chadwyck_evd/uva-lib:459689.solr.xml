Yt's now a rodd God This is to make them to beleiue that I the lord the God of their fathers appear'd to thee, The God of Abraham the god of Isaac, &amp; the god of Iacob. Now agayne Into thy Bosome put thy hand. Moys[es]. O lord yt's full of Leprosie lyke snow. God. putt back agayne into thy bosome lett yt bee Moyses Now yt's lyke to the other flesh. God. yf they will not beleiue thee for the first signe, yet for the latter thou shalt beleiued bee. But yf they neyther will beleeue, take water of the ryuer &amp; powre yt out vpon the land that's drye, &amp; what so euer out of the ryuer thou shalt draw, shall into blood be turned Moyses Eloquent I neuer was: But since thou wt h thy seruant talked, greatter impediment &amp; more slownes of my tongue I fynde God Who made mans mouth, framed the Dumme &amp; deafe, seeinge &amp; ye blynd? Was yt not I? Go on therefore, &amp; in thy mouth I'l bee. &amp; will teach thee what thou shalt speake. Let yt therefore not trouble thee Moyses I thee beseech Lord for to send hym whom thou wilt haue sentt God Behold thy Brother Aaron the Leuit, (who I do know ys eloquent) comes to meete thee, &amp; seeinge thee shall be glad at the heart. Put my words in his mouth, wc h vnto thee I do impart, &amp; I'l in thy mouth &amp; his be, &amp; shew you what's to do &amp; he shall speake vnto the people, what vnto thee I show, &amp; he shall be thy mouth: But in things that pertayne to god thou shalt vnto hym be. In thy hand also take this rod where wt h thou shalt the mervells worke, &amp; vnto Ãgipt go &amp; all these wonders wc h I put in thy hand, shew to pharao: who doth the former kynge succeed, that sought before thy lyfe Moyses Lord I'l be gone, &amp; wt h me take my children &amp; my wyfe. Chorus. You must suppose that moyses ys this while gone vnto Iethro his father in law, &amp; hath gott his consent that he may go to Ãgipt wt h his wyfe &amp; children, &amp; beinge on his way our Lord did meete hym in an Inne, &amp; threatned hym to slay because his sonne Eleasar he had not circumcised &amp; had hym slayne but that his wyfe the wrath of god appeased by circumcision of her sonne: for wt h a sharp stone shee hym circumcis'd: &amp; moyses then went forward on his iourney &amp; to hym Aaron in the Desert came as god commanded: vnto whom Moyses all that god had sayd, to hym related. And now they are both towards Ãgipt gone alonge to gether: where what successe they haue, expect, &amp; you shall see here after Moyses Brother Aaron here th'Auncients are of Israell assembled declare to them, want vnto thee from gold I haue related Aaron Brethren we are vnto you sent by the god of your father, (who your affliction sees) from th'Ãgiptians to deliuer: &amp; bringe you to a land, that's large, &amp; flowes wt h milke &amp; hony. Soar Declare to vs his name. Moys[es]. He wc h ys hath vnto you sentt mee: The Lord god of your father, &amp; the god of Abraham of Isaac &amp; of Iacob sent me to you, for euer that's his name. Hesron. We will not you beleeue that god vnto you did appeare, syth reason none as yet we see wherefore we should you heare for you meere strangers are to vs, whose bare word's not sufficient vs throughly to persuade that god hath you vnto vs sentt, vnlesse you your commission shew, wc h yet we haue not seene. Moyses You say but well. Now to confirme that god hath wt h vs beene &amp; on this message sent vs hither, Aaron this rod here take &amp; hurle yt on the ground, &amp; yt shall be turnd to a snake. Soar, Hesron et ceteri. Oh saue vs from this serpent lest of hym we be deuoured. Moyses Aaron catch't by the tayle, &amp; to a rod yt shall be turned. Semi Brethren behold yt ys agayne conuerted to a rod. Aaron This ys to make you to beleeue, &amp; know that the lord god of your fathers appear'd to vs, the god of Abraham the god of Isaac, &amp; the god of Iacob. Moys[es]. Now agayne into thy Bosome put thy hand. Soar. Lo yt's infec't wt h Leprosie. lyke snow. Moys[es]. put back agayne into thy bosome let yt bee. Hesron. Now yt's lyke to his other flesh. Aaron. Yf you will not beleeue mee for the first signe, yet for the second, you may persuaded bee. Moyses. But yf they neyther credit will: Take water of the riuer &amp; power yt out agayne on the dry land, &amp; what so euer out of the riuer they shall draw, shall into bloode be changed. Semi yf that be so sufficiently your mission ys confirmed. wherefore let's triall make. Yt's true in deede as you dyd say, &amp; shews that you are sent from god, &amp; we will you obay. Moyses Well then content your selues, &amp; at gods patience to not mutter, who your affliction sees, &amp; will from bondage you deliuer, when his good pleasure ys, the whyle wt h you backe we will go, &amp; intercession make for your release vnto kinge pharao. Kinge pharao thus sayth the Lord god of Israell: Dismisse my people that they vnto me may in the desert sacrifice. Kinge pharao Who's the Lord that I should his voyce heare, &amp; lett Israel go? The Lord I do not know, &amp; Israell shall not part mee fro Aaron We three days iourney bidden are to go by t'Hebrewes god wt h in the wildernes to sacrifice vnto the Lord lest that perhaps there should to vs chaunce eyther sword or pestilence Kinge pharao Moyses &amp; Aaron wherefore do you draw the people hence from their worke? To your Burdens go. The people of this land ys much: The multitude you see's encreased vnder hand yf we lett them rest from their worke, they will encrease much more Wherefore see that neyther straw nor breeke you geue them as before, But let them gather straw them selues, &amp; yet their tasks performe as they before haue done, when straw by you was to them borne. &amp; not one iott abate there of, but rather yt increase for idleness makes them to say, th[e]y'l go into the wildernesse &amp; sacrifice to their Lord god. Lett them oppressed bee wt h workes to hinder them from hearkeninge vnto men that lye. you that are ouerseers of my workes see that you do strictly performe ech thinge that now in charge I here haue geuen you. Horma, pistor. My Liege we ready are for to accomplish your commandment Kinge pharao. About your busines then yf our displeasure you'l preuent Now are th'Exactors gone more worke on th'Israelits to lay to hinder their increase, &amp; idle thoughts to take away &amp; what th'effect here of will bee, I'l go my self &amp; see for better will the seruants doe, when that their maister's by. Horma. You ouerseers are of th'Israelits, who haue not made their tasks of breeke, as they were wonte, wherefore you shall be pay'd wt h this same whipp as you deserue in steede of other pay Soar. Good maister hould your hands, for we haue done all that we may to gett our taskes of breeke made vp, but wt h seekinge for straw, wc h was wont to be brought to vs, we hindred were you know. pistor That excuse shall not serue your turnes, but you shall whipped bee &amp; all the rest, to lett you feele of slouthfulnes the penalty Hesron. Oh wo ys vs what shall we do? but here the king's at hand. Semi of our hard vsage streight go let hym vnderstand. Semi. Why mighty kinge do you permitt your seruants to be vsed so cruelly? Straw's not geuen vs, &amp; yet we are compelled wt h stripes for to performe the tasks on vs impos'd before when straw was to vs brought, &amp; yf we fayle are beaten sore Kinge Pharao. You idle are, &amp; therefore say: Lett's to our Lord go sacrifice, but for to stop your mouthes, &amp; hinder these your vsuall out cryes your selues shall gather straw, &amp; yet your taske shall be performed as when you had yt brought, &amp; one breeke shall not be abated wherefore about your worke be gone, &amp; see that yt be done or ells at the exactors hands you shall looke for no pardon Soar Your grace doth hardly deale wt h vs, but yet we will haue patience Kinge pharao yt's your best so to do for feare of stripes, but now lets hence Soar Moyses &amp; Aaron our Lord see, &amp; iudge betwixt vs bee, because that you haue made our sauour stincke abhominably before pharaos seruantes &amp; hym, &amp; haue geuen hym a sworde vs for to kill. Moys[es]. Contented be, &amp; I'l go to our lord. In the meane while go you vnto the worke you haue in hand &amp; yt apply vntill gods will by me you vnderstand. Lord why afflictest thou thy people, &amp; where fore sent thou mee? synce in thy name I spake to pharao they more afflicted bee God. Thou shalt see what I'l do to pharao: for in a mighty hande &amp; stronge he shall dismisse them, &amp; cast them out of this land I am the lord god that appeared vnto Abraham to Isaac &amp; to Iacob, god almighty, &amp; my name Adonai I did not shew to them: &amp; I a couenant made to geue them the land of chanaan, where they as pilgrymes had lyud, &amp; haue heard theyr groaninge, &amp; see how they are oppressed by the Ãgiptians, &amp; my couenant I haue remembred wherefore tell them, I the Lord will from bondage them deliuer &amp; will them for my people take, &amp; be their god for euer. &amp; I'l bringe them vnto the land whereof I promise made to Abraham, Isaac, &amp; Iacob as I before haue sayd Moyses Lord I'l thy message do, though I do feare they will not heare mee syth they haue bene opprest more synce I spake to pharao from thee. The Lord doth send you word from bondage that he'l you deliuer &amp; will you for his people take, &amp; be your god for euer &amp; bringe you to the land, whereof he often promise made to Abraham, Isaac &amp; Iacob, wherefore be not dismayde. Soar Wee list not heare the talke, wt h worke we are so sore oppressed but home warde we'l agayne returne to get our taskes dispatched for when that the Exactors come, yf that they be not done starke nakt we must be stript, &amp; whipped till the blood runne downe. God To pharao kinge of Ãgypt go, &amp; byd hym them dismisse. Moyses Children of Israel heare me not, &amp; then vnlyke yt ys that pharao will respect my words, especially syth I am of vncircumcised lipps, &amp; do speake nothinge perfectly God Behold I haue appoynted thee to be the god of pharao &amp; thy Brother Aaron shall thy prophet bee, &amp; wt h thee go: Wherefore to pharao all thinges speake as I haue thee commanded: &amp; byd hym let the Israelits bee out of his land dismissed. But his hart will indurat be &amp; I my signes will multiply &amp; wonders in the land of Ãgipt, &amp; yet he will not heare thee. When pharao shall vnto you say: Some wonders to vs show thou shalt bid Aaron take the rod, &amp; cast yt before pharao. &amp; to a serpent yt shall be conuerted by &amp; by. Moyses At thy commandment Lord to pharao I will go directly. Kinge pharao thus sayth the lord god of th'Israelits: dismisse my people, that they vnto me may in the desert sacrifice. Kinge phara[o] Who's the lord that I should his voyce heare, &amp; let Israel go I will not them dismisse, vnlesse you can some wonder show Moyses That will we do wt h out delay. Aaron this rod here take, &amp; hurle yt on the grou[n]d, &amp; yt shall be turn'd to a snake. Kinge Pharao. All this can my enchaunters do, as you shall forthwt h see Mogul &amp; Begor let your rods to serpents turned bee. Mogul We will my Liege: Lo here they be in presentes of your honour. Aaron In shewe they are, &amp; by gods sufferance, but myne shall them deuour Kinge pharao Yet will I not dismisse the Israelits: So fare you well. God You see that pharaos heart ys hardned as I dyd fore tell. Wherefore vnto hym in the morninge go, &amp; by the ryuer you shall hym fynde, &amp; in thy hand thy rod take wt h thee thither wc h was into a serpent turn'd, &amp; thus say to hym from mee: The lord god of the Hebrews hath me sent agayne vnto thee, to byd thee in his name children of Israell to dismisse that they may to the desert go, &amp; there vnto me sacrifice &amp; till this present tyme thou neuer would geue eare vnto mee. In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Behold Now I wt h the rod in my hand will stryke the water of the Riuer &amp; vnto blood yt shall be turn'd, &amp; all the fish what s'euer wt h in the same's shall dye, &amp; the water yt self shall putrify: &amp; the Ãgiptions that drinke there of shall afflicted bee. To Aaron also say: Thy rod take &amp; stretch out thy hand vpon the pooles &amp; lakes, &amp; all the water in the land as well in stone as woodden vessels shall into blood be turned Moyses Lord we'l be gone, &amp; say &amp; doe all that thou hast commanded Kinge pharao. Behold Moyses &amp; Aaron are come now agayne vnto mee Aaron The Lord god of the Hebrews hath me sent agayne vnto thee to byd thee in his name children of Israell to dismisse that they may to the desert go, &amp; there vnto me sacrifice &amp; till this present tyme thou neuer would geue eare vnto mee. In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Behold now I wt h this rod in my hand will stryke the water in the ryuer &amp; vnto bloud yt shal be turnd: &amp; all the fish what s'euer ys in the same shall dy: &amp; the water. yt self shall putrify, and both in stone as wooden vessels shall into bloud be turned. Molach Dread soueraigne lord your ryuers are all bloud &amp; putrifyed. &amp; the fish there in's dead: &amp; all the pooles &amp; lakes of water are also chang'd to bloud all the whole land of Ãgypt ouer: so that for want of drynke both man &amp; beast will shortly dye except your highnes can fynd out some way the same to remedy Kinge pharao. I doubt not but the blood will be agayne to water turned shortly, for by Moyses &amp; Aaron they are but enchaunted In hope I would the Israelits haue suffred to be gone Molach Yt may well be, for your magicians (my Liege) the lyke haue done Kinge pharao Then yt seemes not so strange a thinge to be as they pretend wherefore the Israelits away from Ãgypt Il not send but lay vpon them greatter taskes: &amp; yf they be not done soundly wt h whips they shall be beat, &amp; so let's hence be gone God Moyses thou see'st that pharaos heart ys no whit yet relented where fore vnto hym go, &amp; say: the lord hath the commanded all th'Israelits out of the land of Ãgipt to dismisse that they may to the desert go, &amp; there vnto mee sacrifice But yf thou wilt all thy coasts wt h frogs shall filled bee &amp; wt h frogs shall the Riuer buble, wc h shall come vp to thee into thy house, to thy bedchamber, &amp; vpon thy bedd &amp; to thy seruants, houses, people, ouens, where as thy bread ys backt, &amp; into the remaynes of thy meate, for I will stretch out my hand vpon the riuers, &amp; frogs shall the land fill of Ãgipt euery where, &amp; no place shall from them be free Moyses Lord I'l be gone, &amp; to hym say euen as thou hast commanded mee. Aaron Pharao the god of th'Hebrews sayth: The Israelits dismisse that they may to the desert go, &amp; there vnto me sacrifice or els all the coasts of thy land wt h frogs shall filled bee &amp; wt h frogs shall the riuers buble, wc h shall come vp to thee into thy house, to thy bedchamber, &amp; vpon thy bedd &amp; to thy seruants houses, people, ouens, where as their bread ys backt, &amp; into the remaynes of thy meate, for I will stretch out my hand vpon the ryuers, &amp; thy land wt h frogs fill Kinge pharao. Your words are vayne for I will not the Israelits dismisse nor let them to the desert go to their god for to sacrifice Moyses Then Aaron go, &amp; on the pooles &amp; riuers stretch forth thy hand &amp; bringe forth frogs that they may fill all the Ãgiptian land Molach Renouned kinge Aaron hath wt h his rod the riuers stricken &amp; Ãgipt's full of frogs, &amp; they will not away be gotten for all that your wyse men can do: who by their skill did make frogs lyke to them. but by no art away can these same take. So that your howses swarme there wt h: &amp; your bedchamber's full: &amp; they leape on your bedds, &amp; bread out of your ouens pull So that vnless they be destroy'd, neyther your royall maiesty nor any else shall able bee to lyue in all your country. Kinge pharao. Bid moyses them &amp; Aaron come to me wt h out delay to see, yf they that brought these frogs can take them hence away Moyses &amp; Aaron pray vnto the lord that he would free me &amp; my people from these frogs, &amp; I will graunt free liberty to th'Israelits for to depart, and sacrifice to offer vnto the lord their god, &amp; will detayne them here no longer Moyses. Appoynt the tyme when I shall for thee &amp; thy people pray that the frogs may from thee &amp; them be dryuen quit away &amp; remayne no where in thy land, but only in the riuer Kinge pharao. To morrow. Moys[es]. pharao) yt shall be done that thou may know here after that there's none lyke vnto the lord our god for to be found for to morrow shall the frogs be in the riuer, none on the ground: &amp; there vpon we will be gone vnto our Lord to pray Kinge phara[o]. fare you well both. Now they are gone I'l here no longer stay Moyses Now are the frogs in euery house, village, &amp; field all dead &amp; layd vpon huge heapes: &amp; the ground where they lye ys putrifyed but pharao seeinge rest ys giuen, his heart agayne hath hardned &amp; will not vnto vs geue eare, as god before commanded. God Moyses to Aaron therefore say: Go and stretch forth thy hand &amp; the dust of the earth stryke wt h thy rod, &amp; all the land of Ãgipt shall wt h Sciniphes (wc h are smale beastes that flye &amp; do, especially mens eyes molest) infected bee for all the dust of th'earth shall into sciniphes be turned Moyses Lord I'l go &amp; to Aaron say euen as thou hast commanded Kinge pharao. Mogul &amp; Begor you do see how that both man &amp; beast molested are wt h sciniphes, &amp; for them can not rest can you no kynd of way deuise to cause them hence depart Mogul No nor lyke make (though we haue tryed) by all our skill &amp; art Doubtles gods finger was therein, we can yt not deny King pharao. Yet for all that the Israelits shall not dismissed bee but I'l detayne them still, &amp; see them more &amp; more oppressed wt h worke, &amp; now I will begone to see the same effected. God Moyses the heart of pharao hardned ys, &amp; he'l not heare my voyce, but doth a harder hand ouer my people beare, wherefore early aryse, &amp; stand in presentes of kinge pharao who forth vnto the water ys determyn'd for to go, &amp; to hym say: thus sayth our lord; The Israelits dismisse &amp; let them to the desert go vnto me there to sacrifice &amp; if thou wilt not I will send all kynd of flyes vpon thee &amp; on thy seruants, people, houses, &amp; Ãgipt fil'd shall bee wt h flees of dyuers kynds: &amp; Gessen where my people ys I'l mervels make in that same day, for there shall be no flees: &amp; playnly thou shalt know that I the lord am in the midle of th'earth, &amp; will diuision make betweene thee &amp; my people And this signe shall to morrow bee, where fore go tell hym presently Moyses Lord I am ready to performe all that thou hast inioyn'd mee Kinge pharao Mogull &amp; Begor I perceiue that sundry flies are come into all the parts of this land, wc h to vs all are noysome lyke vnto wc h you can not make, nor yet vs from them free Mogul Yt's true my Liege, wherefore you must seeke out some other remedy Kinge pharao. I must in deede, where fore go call Moyses &amp; Aaron hither Begor I will my liege: Behould they are both cominge here to gether Kinge pharao I am content you in this land shall go &amp; sacrifice vnto your god as you desire. Moys[es]. Nay that will not suffice: for yf we shall the abominations of the Ãgiptians offer to our Lord god, &amp; kill those thinges wc h they haue worshipt euer they'l beate vs downe wt h stones, wherefore will go three days iourney into the desert, &amp; sacrifice, as we commanded bee Kinge pharao. Go in the desert sacrifice to your lord god, but see that you in any case do no further go, &amp; pray for mee Moyses when I am from thee gone vnto our lord I'l truly pray &amp; longer then to morrow shall the flies not wt h thee stay But no more then deceiue me thus, but th'Israelits dismisse that they may to the desert go there to our god to sacrifice Molach This morninge mighty pharao as Moyses &amp; Aaron sayd thy land was purg'd of all the flies, when to their god they prayd &amp; not so much as one ys left to our exceedinge ioy Kinge pharao. The people then I'l not dismisse, but labour to destroy them by all meanes I can deuise for feare lest they should grow stronger then wee: wc h to effect, I'l hence vnto them go God Moyses pharao hath thee deceiud, &amp; his heart hardned ys, &amp; he'l not lett my people go accordinge to his promisse. wherefore to hym returne, &amp; say: The lord god of the Hebrewes bids the let th'Israelits go sacrifice, yf thou refuse behould my hand shall be vpon thy field, &amp; on thy horses &amp; also on thy camells, oxen, sheepe, &amp; thy asses: That's a great pestilence or murren shall be amongst thy cattell yf for to go &amp; sacrifice thou'l not permitt my people for the lord will a difference make twixt Israell &amp; th'Ãgiptians for nothinge perish shall that to the Israelits pertaynes where as all that vnto th'Ãgiptians doth belonge shall dye: &amp; all this in thy land to morrow shall be done vnto thee Now moyses wt h this message go, &amp; that wt h out delay Moyses Lord I'l begone, &amp; to hym as thou me commandest, say Molach Dread soueraigne lord a pestilence ys light vpon our horses &amp; also on our camells, oxen, sheepe, &amp; on our Asses so that not one ys left alyue in all th'Agiptian land &amp; none dead in the land of Gessen as we vnderstand Kinge pharao. Yt's strange yf none in Gessen dye, where th'Israelits do dwell &amp; not one here escape: But here comes one that truth can tell Batzo doth there in Gessen dye any cattle of the murren? Batzo One beast my liege there ys not dead in all the land of Gessen that to the Israelits belongd, as by fame ys reported Kinge pharao Yet for all that Israel shall Not from Ãgipt be dismissed but more &amp; more I'l them oppresse wt h worke to keepe them vnder &amp; now I'l go t'impose that charge on hym that's ouer seer God Moyses &amp; Aaron pharaos heart for all this yet ys hardened &amp; he'l not let my people go, as I before commanded. wherefore go &amp; out of they chymney take handsfull of ashes &amp; before pharao let them be sprinkled in th'ayre by moyses &amp; there shall be in men &amp; beasts great boyles &amp; swellinge bledders through out Ãgipt, &amp; none shall them escape, kinge nor Enchaunters. See that all things wc h I haue sayd wt h out delay be done Moyses Lord we'l thy voyce obey, &amp; towards pharao now begone. pharao our Lord god bade me in the ayre these ashes sprinkle &amp; full of boyles &amp; swellinge bledders thou shalt be &amp; the people for god hath thee preseru'd a lyue, that in thee may be shewed his might because thou hast thy heart through thine owne malice hardoned &amp; wilfully refusest still his people to dismisse that to the desert they might go, &amp; there vnto hym sacrifice Kinge pharao. Alas there ryses on my face great boyles &amp; swellinge bledders &amp; all my bodyes also infec't there wt h: help me Enchaunters Mogul Alas my Liege we can not styrre eyther head, or foote, or hand nor able are for boyles &amp; bledders before moyses to stand Molach I bringe you heauy newes my Liege, for through out all your country there's neyther man nor beast from boyles &amp; swellinge bledders free &amp; as yt seemes your maiesty there wt h also infected &amp; your Enchaunters to, &amp; wee our selues are sore perplexed Kinge pharao But for all this yet will I not the Israelits dismisse nor let them to the desert go, vnto their lord to sacrifice Moyses. Gods people yet wilt thou hould backe, &amp; not suffer them to go? The terrible'st hayle that euer was in Ãgipt shall to morrow fall this very houre, lyke vnto wc h since that the land was founded vntill this day there neuer fell: wherefore be well aduised &amp; together all thy cattell gather, lest that they be destroyed for nothinge that ys found abroad in the fieldes shall be spared. but euery kynd of thinge where on the hayle doth lyght shall dye Say not but thou fore warned art pharao, &amp; so I leaue thee. Kinge pharao. Yt's strange that you Enchaunters can not do as they haue done Nor cure our sores that they haue made. But come let vs be gone God Moyses now th'assign'd houre ys come, wherefore stretch out thy hand towardes Heauen that there may fall hayle through out all Ãgipt land &amp; thunder claps mixed therewt h, &amp; lightninge in ech place so terrible that lyke hath not bene since first that Nation was heard of, or seene, &amp; let yt kill or strike vnto the ground both man &amp; beast, &amp; all thinges els, that in the fieldes be found through out all Ãgypt land, but in the land of Gessen shall where as my people dwells, none of these thinges be seene at all. And such of pharaos seruants as of my threats stand in feare in howses will their beasts &amp; seruants keepe to saue them there. but such as do neglect my threats, their beastes &amp; seruants will permitt in the fields to remayne, where the hayle shall them kill. Moyses Lord toward heauen I'l hould vp my rod as thou commandest Lightninge I see, &amp; thunder heare, &amp; hayle wc h downe yu sendest. Oh what a terrible storme ys this of hayle, lightninge, &amp; thunder yf this do not make pharaos heart relent, yt ys a wonder But now I will be gone &amp; see th'effect that yt doth take whether his heart there wt h hardned bee, or humbler yt hym make Molach My liege by this tempestuous storme ech thinge destroyed ys that was wt h out the dores from man to beast wt h herbs &amp; trees through out all Ãgipt, but in Gessen where the Israelits dwell no thunder claps were heard, nor lightninge seene, nor hayle stone fell. &amp; your Enchaunters can neither do the lyke, nor make this cease Kinge pharao. Then forth wt h go, &amp; to me hither bringe Aaron &amp; Moyses Moyses &amp; Aaron I haue sinn'd, &amp; the Lord's iust &amp; righteous &amp; I confesse I &amp; my people are vniust &amp; Impious wherefore pray to the Lord to ceasse both the hayle &amp; the thunder that I may you dismisse, &amp; in Ãgipt stay you no longer. Moyses When I am gone out of the citty I will stretch out my hand to our Lord &amp; the hayle &amp; thunder shall cease through the land that thou may know the Earth's our Lords. But certaynly I know neyther thou nor thy seruants of the lord god stand in owe. yet not wt h standinge I'l be gone &amp; to god for the pray. Kinge pharao. I hope from this plague now we shall be free'd wt h out delay. Already as yt seemes the Lightninge &amp; the thunder ceaseth &amp; the hayle storme ys past &amp; gone, &amp; the mynd also falleth wherefore I am resolu'd the Israelits not to dismisse nor let them to the desert go vnto their god to sacrifice God Moyses the heart of pharao &amp; his seruants hardned bee &amp; he'l not let my people go to sacrifice vnto mee. &amp; this ys done that I may worke my sygnes in hym, &amp; thou tell in thy sonnes &amp; Nephewes eares what I haue done, &amp; you may know that I the lord god am, wherefore returne to pharao &amp; say I t'Hebrewes god do bid hym lett my people go vnto me for to sacrifice, or else in to their coastes I will Locusts to morow sende, wc h are litle flyinge beastes haueinge longe hinder legges, &amp; grasse, &amp; fruites &amp; grayne anoy wc h all the face of th'earth shall couer, &amp; all there on destroy that the hayle hath not spoyld before, &amp; they shall be such numbers as shall th'Ãgiptian houses fill: &amp; as none of their fathers nor their granndfathers euer saw vntill this present day Moyses Lord I'l be gone &amp; vnto pharao shewe, what thou doest say. Molach Your grace did heare that moyses say our land should be infested wt h Locusts vnlesse that children of Israel you dismissed to go &amp; sacrifice to their lord god, as he them bade &amp; he's about now to performe all that he to you sayd. How longe shall we indure these plagues?

Yet ere thou go two tables cutt of stone lyke to the former &amp; on them I'l the same words write, that I writ on the other, when they are made, vp to this mount ascend &amp; bringe them wt h thee Moyses Thankes gratious lord: I will so do. Come you all alonge wt h mee Dominator lord god mercifull, who much compassion takest, patient, clement, &amp; true, who mercy vnto thousands shewest &amp; tak'st away our wicked facts, our synnes, &amp; our iniquitie &amp; no man of hym self there ys that's innocent found before thee.

Aaron &amp; Mary heare my wordes, yf there among'st you bee a prophet of the lord: to hym in vision appeare will I, or to hym speake in sleepe. But moyses ys not such a one for he's the faythfulst seruant in my house wt h out comparison wt h whom I more familier haue bene then wt h any other for wt h hym mouth to mouth I speake, &amp; playnly do conferre &amp; not in ridles nor in figures the Lord god doth he see why therefore from my seruant to detract feared not yee Aaron.

Now mary moyses sister's dead, &amp; so's Aaron his Brother for whose deaths all the people mourn'd full thirty dayes together since wc h tyme th'Israelits haue wt h the chanits incountred &amp; at first got the worse: But afterward, when they had vowed to kill the chananeit kinge of Arad, &amp; all his citties spoyle yf that the victory they gott, they put them to the foyle, &amp; forward went: but by the way agayne the people muttered for wc h wt h fyrye serpents sent by god, many were deuoured. wc h them inforced to confesse their synne, &amp; to desyre moyses to pray for them to god for to auert his yre from them. wc h he did, &amp; god bade hym make a brasen serpent &amp; set yt for a signe, that they that bitten were incontinent might looke there on, &amp; so be cur'd, as many of them were &amp; then they forward went agayne from Arad all together &amp; camp't them selues in Arnon wc h borders vpon the Amorrheit where god almighty for them fought, euen as he dyd in Ãgipt for as pharao &amp; all his Army were in the redd sea drowned so th'Amorrheits by the rocks that fell on them were oppressed &amp; Sehon their kinge slayne in battayle, &amp; all his citties taken where th'Israelits setled them selues, when they the land had gotten &amp; went from thence agaynst the kinge of Basan for to fight &amp; vanquis't hym as before he vanquish't had the Amorrheit &amp; did possesse his land, wc h made the moabits sore afeard the more for that they of their marchinge toward their country heard. &amp; Balac kinge of Moab did send for Balaam a southsayer to curse the Israelits because he thought them to be stronger then he was able to wt h stand, yf by any meanes he might dryue them out of his land, for he loath wt h them to fight for he conceiued in his mynde, &amp; fully was persuaded that they whom he blest should be blest, &amp; cursed whom he cursed But while he wt h his false gods did consult, god their mouthes shutt &amp; th'answeare he should to the messengers make, in his mouth putt forbiddinge hym to go, Or to curse them whom he had blessed &amp; so wt h out his company the messengers back returned. wc h when kinge Balac heard, mo &amp; more noble men he sent to Balaam for to bid hym come alonge wt h them incontinent &amp; curse the Israelits, &amp; well he should rewarded bee. But Balaam's answeare was, yf Balac would bestowe vpon mee his house full of syluer &amp; gold, I can not gods word alter yet yf you'l stay I'l once more see what god will to me answeare where to the messengers did assent, &amp; god vnto hym sayd in the night tyme: aryse &amp; go wt h them, as they the bade yet so, that thou shalt nothinge do, but as I shall commande thee &amp; there vpon Balaam sadlinge his asse went in their company at whom god angry was, &amp; made his Angel for to stay agaynst hym wt h a drawne sword, wc h made th'Asse g'out of ye way whom when Balaam had beat, &amp; made for to returne agayne into the beaten way, Th'Angell before hym did remayne, &amp; stoode in the strayts of two walls, whom th'asse espyinge ioyned her selfe close to the wall, &amp; the foote of the ryder brused. &amp; he her beat agayne: yet neuer the lesse the Angel standinge in a narrow place, where on the right or left hand was no passinge the asse espyed hym, &amp; vnder the ryders feete shee fell who there wt h angred beat her syds more fiercely wt h his cudgell. And our lord openned th'asses mouth, who spake, &amp; sayd what haue I vnto thee done? what makes the now the third tyme for to strike mee? where vnto Balaam answeare made: because thou me abused. I would I had a sword, for by me then thou should be killed. Am not I (quoth the asse) thy beast where on thou always vsed to ryde vntill this day? &amp; euer thus haue I the serued? Neuer sayd he. &amp; forth wt h our lord opened Balaams eyes &amp; he th'Angell in the way wt h a drawne sword standinge spyes. &amp; hym flatt to the ground adord. To whom th'Angell dyd say: why thrice hast thou beaten thy asse? I came because thy way peruerse &amp; wicked ys. &amp; but that thy asse away turned &amp; vnto me gaue place, I had slayne thee, &amp; shee had lyued. I haue (quoth Balaam syn'd not knowinge that thou stoode agaynst mee &amp; I will backe returne yf that my goinge do displease thee. No wt h these men go th'Angell sayd, &amp; see thou nothinge vtter but what by the way of command I shall to the deliuer. Then Balaam wt h the Messengers went, wc h when king Balac heard He ask't hym wherefore he hys iourney had so long differd. sayinge was yt because I could not recompence thy cominge? To whom Balaam replyed: Lo here I am can I say any thinge but what the lord put's in my mouth? Then they together went &amp; when Balac had seauen Altars buylt, Balaam incontinent layd holocausts there on, &amp; sayd as our Lord hym instructed at that same tyme: How shall I curse hym whom god hath not cursed? The dust of Iacob who ys able to number or to tell &amp; truly come to know the number of the stock of Israell? My soule the death dy of the iust: &amp; my last ende be made lyke vnto them. What ys this that thou doe'st then Balac sayd: I sent for thee to curse them, but yt seemes thou hast them blessed. Can I sayd Balaam speake ought else, but what the lord commannded? Then twice more Balac vrged hym agayne to curse the people. wc h he refused for to do: &amp; sayd he was not able. because he was by god forbidden: &amp; playnly then he prophecied of Christ, &amp; that by th'Israelits those lands should be destroyed. wc h Balac so offended that he bade hym get hym thence &amp; neyther would hym honour, nor make hym any other recompence Soone after this the Israelits wt h Moabs daughters fornicated for wc h on gibbets agaynst the sunne god bade they should be hanged &amp; foure &amp; twenty thousand did their lyues loose for that wickednes &amp; two beinge openly naught together were stabbed through by phinees Eleazars sonne: for wc h our lord sayd phinees had auerted from th'Israelits his wrath, because he was wt h his zeale moued, &amp; now th'offenders blood ys shed, &amp; euery one ys dead wt h in the desert wc h before by moyses had bene numbred as god hym self foresayd they should. But what will now ensew here after shall appeare, when I am gone: &amp; so adew God Moyses into the mountayne Abarim go thence to behold the land of promise, into the wc h (as I haue thee foretold) the Israelits thou shalt not bringe, because thou was incredulous at the water of contradiction, though the signes were as merveylous wc h thou had seene me worke before. But when thou hast yt seene thou shalt be gathered to thy people euen as Aaron hath bene Moyses Lord then prouide a man ouer this multitude to bee &amp; bringe them in &amp; out, &amp; go before them when I dye lest the people of our lord should bee as sheepe wt h out a sheepheard God Moyses thy suite allready graunted ys, &amp; prayer hearde On Iosue, in whom the spirit ys, lay thou thy hande whyle he before Eleazar, &amp; multitude doth stande: &amp; in all theyr sights geue hym precepts &amp; part of thy glory yt the Sinagogue of th'Israelits may subiect to hym bee. for hym Eleazar the priest (when any thinge's to be done) shall god consult: &amp; at his word he &amp; the rest ech one shall both go in &amp; out, as vnder thee they haue bene vsed Moyses Lord I'l be gone, &amp; all things do that thou hast me inioyned A hundred twenty yeares of age Brethren I am this day &amp; out &amp; in before you now no longer go I may especially syth our lord sayd I should not passe this Iordan meaninge I should not exercyse the office of a captayne. But this same Iosue in my place shall passe ouer before thee &amp; in your sight these nations shall destroy'd by our lord bee. &amp; you shall them possesse. wherefore see you neyther feare nor tremble at sight of them, for god will you assist agaynst thys people. But yet before I do you leaue, I'l explicate the law wc h in mount Sinai geuen was as you both heard &amp; saw &amp; there vnto add diuers thinges, that were not then expressed &amp; gods especiall benefits recite on you bestowed &amp; you in mynde put of your murmurings &amp; incredulity &amp; punishments for the same, that in offendinge you may bee more wary in the tyme to come. Lastly I will declare the blessings that god will bestow on them that carefull are in keepeinge &amp; obseruinge of his precepts &amp; commaundments. &amp; agaynst them that breake the same his seuere threats &amp; punishments wherefore obserue my words, wc h our lord by my mouth commands you when thou vnto the lord thy god hast sworne or made a vow frustrate make not thy word, nor slackly do the same fulfill for the same at thy hands require be sure our lord god will. And yf thou breake thy vow, he'l yt repute to thee as synne. In not promisinge there's no offence: but yf thy word haue byn wt h out thy lipps, thou shalt obserue, &amp; do what thou hast promised &amp; spoken wt h thy proper will, &amp; from thy mouth deliuered. For vsery thou shalt not lend vnto thy brother money but thou may put thy money out for gayne vnto thyne enemy. Deny not the hyer of the pore, but see that the same day that he hath done his worke, his wages thou vnto hym pay. before the sunne be sett: for there there wt h his lyfe ys preserued lest he cry out vnto our lord, &amp; thou for yt be punished Both iust &amp; true let thy weights be: &amp; haue not in thy purse a lesser &amp; a greatter: nor two bushells in thy house, a greater where wt h for to measure the corne wc h thou shalt buy &amp; lesser for the corne thou sells, but let them equall bee. Agaynst none shall one witnesse serue for any kynd of wickednes but euery word shall stand in the mouth of two or three witnesses Yf that the iudgment thou perceiue doubtfull &amp; hard to bee twixt bloud &amp; bloud, &amp; cause &amp; cause, &amp; leprosy &amp; leprosy &amp; thou see that the Iudges words wt h in thy gates do vary Aryse &amp; go vp to the place chosen by god almighty &amp; to the priests of the Leuiticall stock go, &amp; vnto the Iudge that shall be at that tyme, &amp; aske them what to do who shall shew &amp; declare vnto thee the truth of the iudgments. And thou shalt do what s'euer they that of the place are presidents wc h our lord god hath chosen shall vnto thee say &amp; teach thee accordinge to his law, &amp; thou his sentence shalt obey &amp; neyther to the right hand nor the lefte thou shalt decline. And he that shall be proud, &amp; at the priests iudgment repyne that ministreth then vnto our lord thy god, by the decree &amp; sentence of the Iudge agaynst hym geuen, that man shall dye &amp; in so doinge the euill thou shalt take away from Israell wc h heard, the people will feare, &amp; in pryde none after swell. When you haue Iordan past, &amp; the land of chanaan entred see that th'Inhabitants of that land by you be all destroyed. Their Titles breake, statues in fitters burst, waist their Excelses, &amp; clense the land, that there in dwell you may, &amp; yt possesse. But yf you kill them not, The remayne shall be to your eyes as yt were Nayles, speares in your sydes, &amp; your most deadly enemyes. Feare not but to remembrance call what god hath done to pharao &amp; the Ãgiptians ere he would permitt you thence to go. what grievous plagues he layd on them, &amp; how he you protected &amp; in a stronge hand brought you thence, &amp; his whole army drowned. Thinke on how god did fourty yeares in wildernesse afflict thee triall to make yf vnto hym thou would obedient bee &amp; all that while to thee he manna for to eate did geue to make thee know that in bread only a man doth not lyue but lyues in euery word that from the mouth of god proceedeth. And the rayment wc h thou this fourty yeares hast worne, yet lasteth. All wc h, &amp; much more god hath done for thee that thou might know hys loue to thee, &amp; feare hym also yf thou breake hys law. Wherefore his precepts keepe, &amp; to his voyce attentyue bee, &amp; higher then all nations on the earth our lord will make thee. for he will thy protector be, thy buckler, &amp; thy shielde &amp; blest thou shall be in the citty, &amp; blessed in the fielde. &amp; blessed in thy cattel, heards, &amp; sheepe thou shalt be found blest shall the fruit be of thy wombe, &amp; the fruite of thy ground blest in thy barnes, &amp; thy remaynes, &amp; in thy goinge out &amp; cominge in, &amp; blest in euery thinge thou goes about. Our Lord will make thyne enemyes that do ryse vp agaynst thee to fall downe in thy sight, &amp; make thee go away wt h victory. One way they shall agaynst thee come, but seauen ways shunne thy face. These blessings shall vpon the light, yf thou do what god sayes, &amp; keepe his lawes, &amp; neyther go on the right nor left hand. But yf thou wilt not heare his voyce, nor be at his command Curst shall thou be both in the citty, fieldes, &amp; in thy barnes &amp; in thy cattell, heards, &amp; sheepe, &amp; in all thy remaynes. The heauen in due seasen shall not to thy hand yield rayne. And where as thou art head, thou shalt become the tayle agayne Wt h pouerty thou shalt be pincht, wt h famyne &amp; wt h hunger. Wt h sicknesses god will the visit, as pestilence &amp; feuer. Wt h frisinge could, &amp; scorchinge heate thou shalt consumed bee. A corrupt ayre, &amp; blastinge wynde shall euer more molest thee. The heauen that ys ouer thee shall be of brasse, The ground where on thou treadst, of yron. On th'earth for rayne dust shal be found One way agaynst thy enemyes thou shalt go forth, but flye seauen wayes before their face vntill that thou dispersed be throughout all kingdomes of the earth. Thy carkas shal be meate for foules &amp; beastes, &amp; no man shall prohibit them to eate. wt h Boyles, &amp; scabs, &amp; Itch thy nether parts shall festered bee &amp; thy mynd shall possessed be, wt h madnes, blyndnes, fury. So that thou shalt grope at midday as blind men are accustomed &amp; thou shalt euer wronge sustayne, &amp; by none be releeued. wt h the wyfe that thou maryed hast an other man shall lye &amp; an other shall in thy house dwell, that buylded was by thee. Thou shalt a vinyard plant, &amp; not the vintage there of take Thy goods shall in thy sight be taken, &amp; thou no rescue make. Now brethren I both heauen &amp; earth do call this day for witnesse that I haue sett before you lyfe &amp; death, blessings &amp; curses choose therefore lyfe that thou may lyue, &amp; thy seede yt comes after the &amp; gods commandments keepe, wc h by gods grace thou mayst do easely &amp; thou the foresayd blessings shall inioy. But yf thou will not heare the voyce of thy lord god, nor his precepts fulfill these curses shall vpon thee light that I haue here recited Wherefore choose wc h of them thou list, cursed to be, or blessed But yf you will my counsell take do not your lord god anger but when that good &amp; bade's before you set, the good choose rather &amp; god will the assist, &amp; euer thy conductor bee. &amp; Iosue in my place appoynted hath to go before thee. Iosue a good heart haue, be stronge, &amp; courage to thee take for god will thee captayne &amp; guyd of this his people make to bringe them to the land of promise, &amp; thou shalt yt diuide by lot amongst them: &amp; our lord hym self will be thy guyde. He will not thee forsake nor leaue, wherefore be not afrayd but willinge be to vndertake this charge as god thee bade. And now on the as god charg'd me, I do impose my hand whyle thou before Eleazar, &amp; multitude dost stande: &amp; here in all their sights on thee bestow part of my glory that the whole synagogue of this people may be subiect to thee. for thee Eleazar the priest, (when any thinges to be done) shall god consult: &amp; at his word thou &amp; the rest ech one shall both go in &amp; out, as vnder me they were accustomed. Iosue Obediently I'l vndertake all that our lord commanded. Moyses Then let's be gone, for I know not when that our lord will take mee out of this world, but as I thinke myne end will now be shortly Iosue Now hath our lord to Moyses shew'd all the land of chanaan all Nephthali, Iuda &amp; Galiad as farre as Dan wt h Ephraim &amp; Manasses, &amp; the rest. wc h when he had playnly seene wt h his eyes, our lord god thus vnto hym sayd This is the land wc h I to Abraham, &amp; his seede promised but vnto yt thou shalt not go, as vnto thee I signifyed at the water of contradiction. Since as God did command Moyses the seruant of our lord ys dead in Moab land &amp; agaynst phogor in a valley god dyd his body lay &amp; none his sepulcher haue knowne vntill this present day: &amp; in his place I must succede, &amp; to chanaan land the Israelits conduct: to whom I'l go now out of hand. Chorus. Moyses one hundred twenty yeares old was when that he dyed &amp; neyther were his eyes dyme, nor any of his teeth decayed. wt h the place of his buriall only th'Angels were acquainted whose ministery god vs'd there in, lest Iewes should hym haue honoured as god hym self, yf they had knowne, beinge rone vnto Idolatry. &amp; the days that the Israelits did mourne for hym, were thirty. &amp; there arose no more a prophet in Israel lyke te moyses who had our lord seene face to face, &amp; had so good successe in all the thinges he tooke in hand, &amp; wrought so many wonders &amp; signes wt h in the land of Ãgipt, &amp; scap't so many daungers, as Moyses did. &amp; now this charge to Iosue ys committed where in what successe he shall haue in tyme will be discouered.</field>
