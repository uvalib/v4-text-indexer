      <field name="fulltext">SCENE: Rome, A.D. 212.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Rome: the Audience-Room of the Empress in the Regia. Julia Domna and Varonilla. VARONILLA. Empress, you bade me leave my orbÃ¨d temple, And leave my Vestals. Sudden the command. What would you of me? JULIA DOMNA. Counsel. You are wise By custom and by worshipâI, alas, Only by argument of doctrine gathered From sages and philosophers. To-day I need the holier aid. O Varonilla, A mother seeks your wisdom, as she came From a red vineyard's slope, and coil on coil Bewildered of its circumstance, to rest In a cool grove. (Varonilla presses her hands on the hands of the Empress as they sit down together.) VARONILLA. Oh, patience! JULIA DOMNA. Nay, not patience, An instant remedy. Too cool your hand, Though I have prayed for coolness. VARONILLA. What extreme Disturbs you, Empress? You have all my prayers Through all my virgin daysâfor you, for Rome They rise in sacrifice. JULIA DOMNA. For me, O Vestal, And for my sons. VARONILLA. As they are lords of Rome. JULIA DOMNA. As they are mine, my sonsâmy womanhood Grown valiant, my warriors and my gods; As they are mine, and you would succour me, Give me your counsel for my jarring sons. VARONILLA. Whence springs the strife? I know the elder boy Most dominant of will, the second haughty, But easy to appease: such elements Are not as sea and fire. JULIA DOMNA. Even in their games They fought so intricate, I could but stand And pray them to unlock. Now in their manhood . . . How speak of it! I faint at their approach, I tremble if together they salute me. They have no eyes, save for each other's faces, Or fix on mine, so jealous of my favour I dare not smile nor drop one little kiss On Geta's brow, where 'neath the flecking wreath I dote on it, nor gather in my palms My Caracalla's head and feel my world There in the goodly orb. I dare not move Nor blink an eyelid lest they close in strife So rancorous I might be left alone. You question wherefore! But wherefore doth the north wind bring us wrecks, The south wind locusts? Wherefore? It is hidden. O Priestess, you distract me, for I fear, Watching your coldness, that you have no heart To look into my misery. (She rises, steadying herself against the Vestal.) Conceive! Each sole and each essential, yet at warâ Now they would break the world in two, would rule One here in Rome and one in Antioch . . . Where shall I rule? VARONILLA. O lady, recollect, Some ills of nature find their remedies In their own violent instincts. And the peril Is often in the curb. What is the earthquake But fatal rigour Put on the wild expulsion of those streams That flame about their mountain-roots! JULIA DOMNA. The judgment Of a cold heart the womb has never pressed. VARONILLA. You have forgotten Vesta keeps alight The hearth-flame of the peoples. Verily Her counsel is not chill, but of a function To spread its blessing. JULIA DOMNA. How, its blessing, woman? VARONILLA. Yea, on the subjects of your jarring sons; Yea, on your sons themselves, for peace is sacred And grows Hesperian gifts; yea, and on you, For so shall your maternity establish No hope where ruin labours. JULIA DOMNA. Varonilla, Not from your voice that never cooed a song Above the milking babe, may such as I Receive true adjurations. VARONILLA. (Retiring.) Then farewell. Your courtiers approach. JULIA DOMNA. Stay, Varonilla. It is the grave Papinian. . . . If he sentence My soul to exile, putting death between My life and motherhood . . . (Papinian advances.) Papinian, hither! This reverend lady would dismember Rome, And give a half to Antioch. PAPINIAN. Forbid, Ye Roman Gods! VARONILLA. I for one household speak Of ended variance; and for the people, Beneath the diverse empire of opponents In whirlwind from two quarters of the air. JULIA DOMNA. I am the peace of these opponents, therefore The safe-guard of their lives and empire. PAPINIAN. Nature Is with you in your causeâand Rome herself, Rome that is one. There is no other city Where emperors can live imperial; nature And polity are with you. VARONILLA. But with Vesta Is steadfast, lamplit wisdom in the darkness Of polity and nature. PAPINIAN. Most revered, You counsel as a woman, not as Jove, Who sees the sweep and precedents of action, With rolling eye above the universe. Your lamp is to a little holy circle Its aureola: there the deed is seen But in itself without far consequence. We must not parcel Rome: the ages stand To interdict it, and the gods restrain. JULIA DOMNA. O peerless helper! What large delivery of all my heart Was still beneath! Now I can hold my Court. (Enter Roman ladies and courtiers. Papinian, bowing low, slips a parchment into the Empress' hand.) PAPINIAN. And take our gifts. JULIA DOMNA. My Stoic, meditation Will come with the more even hours: my thanks. MANY VOICES. The high gods bless our Empress with long life Of happy days. JULIA DOMNA. (Smiling, as she receives gifts.) A jewelâ A wound of light, for so would bleed the sun. (Enter Fadilla.) And flowers . . . Roses that swell up to the gazeâsuch roses, From you, Fadilla, come to give your welcome To my new year of age. (Perceiving Geta at a distance, who enters, followed by Pylades.) Papinian, look! My Geta!âVestal, you must envy me. VARONILLA. The boy is very fair, and yet for Rome, Were there dispute, he is not Romulus. JULIA DOMNA. I shudder. See, Papinian, see, Fadilla, A favour rests on him, a grace: his brows . . . FADILLA. Are as my brother's, Empress. My old age Is quickened of the vision. Thus Olympus Pricks out its favourites. This smarting beauty, And all its gifts to you Fadilla envies With blessing in the spleen. GETA. (With deep obeisance.) Hail, Domina, My Empress. Mother, I have brought the cup, That Dido bent her lip on when in Carthage She feasted with Ascanius at her heart. Regard the chasings, how they wroughtâregardâ Before the days of Rome. JULIA DOMNA. My Ganymede! GETA. Nay, mother, but behold how it is wrought, How the age-kneaded silver smiles from dints Sleek where no pattern waves. JULIA DOMNA. And Dido drank Her sorrow from this bowl! GETA. It is the rareness Of the bossed cup that made me choose it thine; But it is full from white pit to white brim Of wishes for thy happiness, thy health. Nay, drink them from my lips. JULIA DOMNA. There, there I drink. My thanks to you are kisses. O beloved, How is it that I lose all eloquence When you must be the theme? To fondle you, To kiss you on the eyes, to cover you Thus in my cloak as from an enemy! Oh pardon, we are here 'mid loving friends, And my heart surges. GETA. Here among our friends! Were I a slave it were less difficult To steal this audience of you. Recollect I am your son, and look henceforth that you Caress me and in presence of my brother, As your good pleasure prompts. JULIA DOMNA. If you would have me To move in state between you, both must stay, My constant props, beside me. Antiochâ That is your name, my Geta; so I shrieked Last night when calling for you in a dream. When I embrace you it is all farewell; You are going from me, and my threatened doom Draws down my blood to ebb, beholding you. GETA. O mother, mother, It is the East my whole life levels at; There is my mark, there is my golden empire, There the sun risesâthere, at last secure From thwarting and from peril, I shall warble The music of my happy star and breathe. O mother, rule with me at Antioch, With me in your own native Asia. Come With me, your son, to steer your honoured craft Home to its early port. JULIA DOMNA. Child, you forget My years, because I smile with countenance The gods have wafted youth to. You forget That constantly to pass the cruel sea, To constantly repass it, and to bear The openness of chance by land and sky, Would bow me to my grave. And to these labours Add sorrow of continual taking leave Or fear of it as boding. Caracalla! The book beneath his lidsâit is a wrath That seems to have a thirst in it. (Caracalla enters; he is wrapped in a dark hooded Gallic cloak. A splendid robe of gold tissue is borne before him. Tarantus follows.) My son, But almost I am speechless at this bliss, (Nervously handling the netting.) The richness of this present. Caracalla, Your lips. CARACALLA. He is before me. This shall cease. You have received him and his gift. JULIA DOMNA. Beloved, Our love is not of time or of its laws; And for your gift, my first-born son, I take it Whenever it is brought as yours, the first Of any tribute. And so fair a netting Of golden tissue, you would bring me summer To hang on me her light. CARACALLA. I am forestalled, And this is yours but as you choose or not: So your next birthday will be here or there At Antioch, as you choose. JULIA DOMNA. My senses swirl . . . You all grow dim, all fade. (Caracalla catches her in his arms.) GETA. Mother, look up. We will delay our plan, do anything If you revive. CARACALLA. (In a whisper.) Be mine, O more than Rome! Stay with me, stay in Europe. GETA. What, you whisper Close to my mother's ear? Is this your justice, To lure me into exile? (To Julia Domna.) Rouse yourself, Say, will you banish me, be kept aloof By Asia's farness from me? JULIA DOMNA. No. My strength Is come again. I cannot slip your arms, My Caracalla. Geta, take my hand. You both have found a means to put the earth And sea between you, have you not, my sons? CARACALLA. You know we cannot sit on golden chairs, And side by side demur. Europe and Asia Are for some purpose of divinity Cleft by Propontis with his waves. Of old It cost a man his life to swim that strait. 'Tis good it shall divide us. PAPINIAN. Fall of greatness, Of all divine efficiency! My emperors, Listen to one your father's bosom friendship Has honoured past belief. JULIA DOMNA. Papinian, speak. PAPINIAN. Your mighty father left his empire, vast And solid in its frame, to you his sons, To be maintained, not broken by a sea. CARACALLA. We take our judgment now in matters dealing With functions of a god. Jove and Augustus Alone confer. You set yourself on high Who are but nothingâand for what you babble As to our father's will, he set the curse Of dual empire on the lands, he fostered The need of our conclusion. JULIA DOMNA. Asia, Europe! The sea, an interfluent stream, a channel, You say, will sever the huge continents You rule betwixt you? How will you divide Your mother, how will she be torn asunder, And shared between you? There is but one way; Sheathe in my breast your swords and cleave my corse That each may have a sepulchre to visit In his own kingdom. So I shall be portioned, As realms are slit for each by barren seaâ My heart as but two parcels of the world. Yea, I must be a corse, as Rome herself, Mother of Empire, ye will immolate, If she be reft in two. My sons, relent. I am your peace, between your golden chairs I stand at one with each, sustaining both On to the end. Your treaty is my sentence, Is death. Deliver me! GETA. O well-beloved, You set us by your prayer on the rock-edge Of such confusion you might shudder at If you were clear of sight nor mocked the truth. CARACALLA. Pain of the unendurable, the pain And feud of it within! VARONILLA. O Empress, listen! Let them apart, let the cold Hellespont Wash safely the partition of their lives. CARACALLA. If we oppose the unendurable With that which cannot be endured, the gods Must hide their eyes. How pale you are, grey-pale! Some of you fetch her wine. Mother! JULIA DOMNA. My children, I gave you life; return the gift to-day, To-day, my birthday. (Laying her head on Caracalla's breast.) O my first-born, bid me Live from this hour. Let me owe breath henceforward Only to you, my terrible, my lord And emperor. Give me life, O loved! Receive Your brother's hand and rule in Rome together With me beside you. Caracalla, listen! Life, lifeâfrom you! CARACALLA. O mother, you have made it My gift that you should live, have asked your breath From me alone, with solitary eyes. Geta Augustus, for her sake, I pray you Cancel our treaty of division, dwell In Rome. We will divide the royal palace And not the world, that my petitioner May live on and not die. Will you accord Her one desire she has implanted mine? (Geta turns from Caracalla to his mother.) GETA. To you I will give back the life you gave, To you! (Addressing Caracalla.) I will remain with her in Rome; A boon she has implored. JULIA DOMNA. Your hands in mine, Folded upon my bosom, on my heartâ One clasp. Forgive, these tears are happiness. Wine? I have now no need of it, who drink Your mercy, Caracalla; my dear Geta, The faith of love you give, wreathing the cup Your brother steeped. Ah, I am well and strong. Romans, acclaim with feastings, and piled altars, And mirth this reconcilement. Let the Temple Of Concord smoke till evening, for the gods Make peace. CARACALLA. (In her ear.) If gods make peace, your grey-pale face Is first among them. JULIA DOMNA. Hush! We have been speaking Across an air not made for flight of words To carry pinions. See, my Geta beams Upon his lovely friend; Fadilla holds him Both of her grateful hands. CARACALLA. Then both your hands For me. JULIA DOMNA. Ah, Caracalla! CARACALLA. Both. JULIA DOMNA. A feast I make for my two emperors. Pylades Shall dance. CARACALLA. Tarantus? JULIA DOMNA. (Bowing her head.) Show his swordman's craft. Now to the Temple of the Queen of Heaven I go, to praise her. You on either hand, I do not envy her, though Queen of Heaven. Come, women; come, Fadilla. Noble Vestal, This is a triumph to the household fire; None will forsake it. (To her sons.) Let me find you ready For the great banquet. (Caracalla kisses her.) Geta! (She kisses him.) O my sons! (Exeunt all, save Caracalla, Geta, Pylades, &amp; Tarantus.) CARACALLA. The right wing of the palace will be mine, You and your dancers, Grecians and musicians May lodge upon the left. I need access To the arena and the hippodrome. GETA. I take the left, and there enjoy the sun That is so much my flatterer for hours. CARACALLA. See that no soul you own or dominate Passes my threshold, or that step is death. GETA. Still make your bread yourself and have a care Since we are in one stable though two stalls. And take your branded gladiator, take him; Strive on the rank sand as his pupil! Rome Will shout applause of laughter. CARACALLA. (Turning on his heel.) Ah, Tarantus, Our words are blows; and there are thunder-storms Of instant violence. Farewell, little brother. GETA. And you too, little satyr! (Exit Caracalla with Tarantus.) (To Pylades.) Do you cloud? What is your grief? You are commanded to the feast to-night; The Empress wills you there. Nothing is changed, Nothing in all your life. PYLADES. With you in Rome, A statue cast away! GETA. Your power remainsâit is the power to please. Nothing is changed between us. You will dance; I shall applaud you for a little while. . . PYLADES. Prince! GETA. And to save herself Leave-taking agony she bids me die!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. The same apartment belonging to the Empress. In the background Julia Maesa stands by Papinian, who is instructing her daughters Soemias &amp; Mamaea. Julia Domna, in a magnificent dress, sits on a low seat in front. JULIA DOMNA. O heavenly Leda, did'st thou mourn thy sons Alternate, day by day, one at thy side, One mortal and removed? (To Julia Maesa who advances.) You cannot feelâ You have your children in your sight. JULIA MAESA. Ay, daughters. Envy me not. JULIA DOMNA. I am the bar between Two snarling captives, not the lioness Spreading her rich caresses on her cubs. JULIA MAESA. What would you do, annulling your own deed? You have your sons in Rome. JULIA DOMNA. But Antioch Was as my Geta's bride; And in the poignancy of expectation I drew him back. JULIA MAESA. He gives you no reproach, He is most duteous? JULIA DOMNA. More, most lovable, And yet exacting as the dying are, And jealous of my passing in and out. He speaks no more of Homer and the ways Of the far-travelled heroes; but contests Fiercely each emblem of authority, As he were guarding his own monument. JULIA MAESA. Nay, but you have a son, I think by Mars; Yield me the secret. JULIA DOMNA. Praise him, Julia, Praise himâmy Caracalla! Generous You are, and ever you have praised my sons. JULIA MAESA. Should not a woman praise him! He infusesâ Even as the burning lava lures the vine To venture to its rosy parapetsâ Such promptness and such vigour in the women He takes into his counsel they prevail, They govern Rome. Worship your Hercules, Then reign a widow Empress o'er the world. JULIA DOMNA. Reign o'er the world, when my beloved no more Can feel the spur to rule! I have caged my bird, And his drooped pinions are to me Death's wings. . . Guardians of Rome and fellow-gods, and gladness Of all the earthâI have two emperors: They must reign side by side, and in my sight. JULIA MAESA. Ay, there the thunder nods! JULIA DOMNA. I have united The continents; I must unite my sons: So shall my Geta Feel he has place and sovereignty, once more Taking the common homage. I must plead . . . And yet I cannot! There are voices in me That thrust me quite aside, and silences Too sluggish for my will. You have no sonsâ To learn their manhood quells you even more Than God's dim sovereignty; it is so close, Too close to meddle with. I stood apart When Caracalla first struck Geta down; I saw it as one sees a mountain crush The city at its foot. JULIA MAESA. But I have seen How you can make that cruel mouth of his A bed of balmy flowers. JULIA DOMNA. It is my dread Corrupts my deeper love; and I am mortal Unless he condescend. His jealousy Girds round his love as a dark sea, and flows So threateningly no craft can traverse it. Give me no hope, and yet restrain me not, For I am destined, and I go to him As one who walks asleep and with no aim That will not startle from me when I wake. I go to him. JULIA MAESA. No, you command him here. Papinian, I beseech you, as you love Our sovereign lady, seek her elder son. PAPINIAN. (Rising and advancing.) In the Arena? JULIA MAESA. Wheresoe'er he is. JULIA DOMNA. (Leaning on her sister's shoulder.) And bid him instant to me, say I count The moments till he come, say carefully I am alone. (Exit Papinian.) Now all of you must leave me, For even the shadow of a form beside Is fatal. (Kissing her sister.) Julia, you will pray the gods. (Exit Julia Maesa with her daughters.) O Queen of Heaven, thou close, Thou closest breather with me of my days, By that last sorrowing of my womb and all The tenderness that clung about my life Being delivered of a second son, Preserve him, hide my secret, put away The passion in my thoughts, and give me cunning To cope with the great tempest that I love To lay asleep, that now I must unloose. (Turning to the door.) He is my god to punish and afflict me; He is my god and the one favouring boon I press on him he grants me or I die. He comes: how quick a tread, how hurrying . . . . (Enter Caracalla, with the net and trident of a retiarius.) Dear son, O Caracalla! CARACALLA. I am swift To thank you for this favour, for that word You wanted me alone and for my sake. JULIA DOMNA. I wanted youâ CARACALLA. My thanks. Now the parched Afric wind, the sharper onslaught Of my galled adversary o'er the sand Are noteless, you so buoy me with this grace. But tell me of thy health. JULIA DOMNA. A little weary With this ill-wind, dejectedâ CARACALLA. Are these dark eyes rimmed dark for lack of me? Have you kissed Geta? (She shakes her head.) Not to find him here! We had such kisses those three years before You set him up against me. JULIA DOMNA. Nay, but Juno Gave me that other son, and of her sanction I love you both unlimited, with love Entire as light or air to star and star. The gods are parents to us all, and love Of mortal parents to their children should Be as the gods in balance. O my son . . . . CARACALLA. You are most beautiful when you look up, My very deity; but even a goddess Protects one hero on the field, accepts One homage. (He casts his net on the floor.) Here I lie down at your feet Adoring you. In me you have the world. My father gave you nothing: our true gifts We offer to ourselves. You dote on empire, You dreamed it, and you bore me, Bassianus, Crowned Antonine, me with no other fondness Than in your smile. Through me, Colossal in my love, And subject as a slave, to your caprice, So that I have you all, you sway the world. So that I have you all, So that it matters not what life I take, What beasts I slaughter. Be indifferent To your sister, to your women, to your son, Indifferent as to the spouse you sat And smiled beside and watched me while I plotted To put him from you. You are not a fool As other women to be bound by names, You know there is a good in life, essential As blood to ghosts, and whoso proffers it With him you must be sovereign. JULIA DOMNA. Bassianus, Why do you ask what you have ever taken, And what I never shall deny? CARACALLA. As wine I have flushed your face. Are you so weary now And so dejected? But your very raiment Shines in my presence and casts off a dust Of little stars. Weary beside my father, Gentle with Getaâthat is wearinessâ With Julia Maesa you are poignant, fine In wit and sally. Am I tyrannous? I am not: every creature that enhances Your beauty blesses me as favouring sun The orchard of my fruits. (He rises &amp; fronts her.) What is the boon? JULIA DOMNA. What boon?âI had forgot. CARACALLA. But I will grant it, I must in this great prodigy of joy To find you thus, to give you health again Simply by breathing near you. Majesty, No son, but Hercules I think in me Has pulled at Juno's breasts again. I smack The flavour still of those first draughts. Beloved, If you would ease my reeling brain, confer Some labour on me, some attempt; for you I would disjoint the hills. JULIA DOMNA. Nay, of myself And for myself I cannot heave a wish. CARACALLA. But for your greater honourâa fresh palace, Baths of more tempered coolness, any jewel That the East buries . . . . JULIA DOMNA. For my greater honour And pride of glory! But there is a thing . . . . Come to me, for you cannot understand Unless I speak it close. (She stretches her arms to Caracalla &amp; whispers to him.) CARACALLA. Rise from your knees. JULIA DOMNA. I am not kneeling, (Caracalla is silent, Julia Domna turns away terrified.) CARACALLA. (With a slow smile.) But there is a power I may myself invoke. JULIA DOMNA. (Turning to him.) O Caracalla, Your daemon, the low voice of your own soul. CARACALLA. You cannot name the power. (After a pause, with a deep inclination.) When least you hope, Your prayer is heard. Lo, I extinguish strife With Geta, in your presence meet him here, Within your room; and we will give this palace One hearth, one board, one audience-chamber, one Glad-smiling Larâfor we will be as one, And rule as one. You shall embrace him even Before my eyes. Go, fetch him out of exile; Bring him to me. JULIA DOMNA. If from your soul you speak . . . . CARACALLA. By Vesta's Sacred Relics. JULIA DOMNA. You will meet him? CARACALLA. Within the hour. JULIA DOMNA. And will become as one? CARACALLA. Ay, as one son. (Julia Domna, still keeping her eyes on him, goes out.) (Snapping his thumb.) The Syrian bitch, what guile! (Calling into the ante-room as the sound of her footsteps ceases.) Tarantus, heigh! (Tarantus enters. Caracalla feels the muscles of his arms.) This armâa sea of waves Has not more flow of power. It strikes where'er I bid itâay, Tarantus? TARANTUS. (Biting his own arm.) Oath of blood! CARACALLA. Geta is coming hither, by that doorâ He must not pass that way again, or forth. TARANTUS. I slay your brother. CARACALLA. There are many names To every man. I strike my enemy, My rival, my supplanter . . . (Motioning Tarantus to the door.) Romulus, By the one blow thou gavest to the brother Deriding thy possession, aid me now! TARANTUS. (Returning.) I cannot, single-handedâ CARACALLA. Fetch my guard. Swift, O my swordsman in the game I love. (Exit Tarantus.) Geta! His name at whisper in my ear, The boon for him . . . My passion of repugnance Must have an act: she shall be drawn to me, Concentrate as a blood-hound on the trail, By her own Geta's blood. 'Tis she I strikeâ Geta is nothing. If he hated me He might be precious; hatred in his nature Is but new vintage he is frantic with; And mineâ The seasoned treasure of the long, black years! My hatred must be mated with her love, Since she can breed no hate for me. She wants me: She will, when I have made her lonesome. Nothing Left in your place when you would come to it, That is destruction, that is victory! (Re-enter Tarantus with soldiers.) Crouch there; stir not a muscle. When I say âGeta Augustus, we are reconciled,â Rush from concealment, do the work of peace. Tarantus, from to-day I make you free, But not from the arena. Guards, to-morrow A largesse pours on you from half the world. (Looking round.) Is there escape? The vestibule, the stairsâ Lock all the palace, bar the windows up; And I will send you moreâin every corner, (Clearing spaces.) Behind this broidery frame, this instrument, These milky coils, behind her throne. . . . With speed, And hush and rush and speed encounter him. (Exit.) (The soldiers &amp; Tarantus hide behind a curtain.) VOICES. (From the ante-room.) Peace! ANOTHER VOICE. Is the palace closed? ANOTHER VOICE. No exit here. (Soldiers steal from the ante-room, across the audience-chamber to a small inner room.) A SOLDIER. (Turning to the curtain as he passes.) Who strikes the blow? VOICE. (From the curtain.) His brother. THE SOLDIER. Who will strike? ANOTHER SOLDIER. Tread down that curtain; as a frightened horse It shudders in the gale. VOICE OF TARANTUS. Hist! Will you stir? (The wind falls for a moment.) (Re-enter Caracalla; he looks round, then nods.) CARACALLA. All quiet! Even sirocco sleeps! (With a sudden movement.) Swing, swing, your lamps! And let him see them rocking! . . . I must flee! (Exit.) SOLDIER. (From behind the throne.) You saw? SECOND SOLDIER. He will undo us. FIRST SOLDIER. Patience; this Dull air is not for action. Was 't a ghost Or shadow moved him? SECOND SOLDIER. If he fears . . . TARANTUS. (From behind the curtain.) Be still! Strike only when I strike. The victim comes. A VOICE. It is the wind. ANOTHER VOICE. No, no, a noise. . . . 'Tis footsteps. SOLDIER. (From the inner room.) Hark! VOICE. (From the curtain.) Again It is the wind. TARANTUS. He comes beyond the wind. (After a while re-enter Julia Domna with Geta.) GETA. No one is here, and we are quite alone. Where then is Caracalla? JULIA DOMNA. But he swore, Here in this room he swore . . . and he is here. Is it not changed? Some preparation That they have made! GETA. They have not set two thrones. He comes attendedâ If there is preparation. JULIA DOMNA. No. My lute Has fallen: it is the wind. The veil I wrought is thrust aside. . . . It is the wind. Draw closer to the hearth; he swore by Vesta, By Vesta's Relics. GETA. Peace, he comes fraternal; If not, then I am here To put my hand into my enemy's As in a cleft of honey. . . . But no matter! JULIA DOMNA. (Looking steadily at the door.) He will be with us straight. GETA. You tickled me From my drowsed lair; you need the huge diversion Of drawing us to growl about your skirts And do no harm, restrained by pact and vow: The Empress has her will, and we are friends As friendly licking dogs that lick to snarl. Remember, mother, in my heart to him There is imprisoned rancour every instant. (He turns from the hearth.) JULIA DOMNA. (Following him.) Have pity, I could live no more without you, I shuddered when I woke and when I slept. . . . Sudden, maternal, I sent for you, with gasping at my breath, As I recalled you from your foster-nurse, When you were in the country and my heart Trembled to feel you mine. GETA. He does not come. JULIA DOMNA. He does, he must . . . Geta, the little statue Of Victory, placed in your brother's chamber, I lay alternate in your own: the gods Salute that statue. GETA. Then the gods are men. Mother, you crowned me onceâI was a child, You led me softly to your little garden, Winnowed by summer butterflies, and twined me A wreath of violets, calling me your CÃ¦sar With purple round my head. It fooled me then; It does not fool me now. There is one part For each of us to play, one part aloneâ Mine is a little part, an inch, an ell, As I had died in childhood. You are weeping? Would I had died! JULIA DOMNA. A dove upon my bosom, Though all the softness of my life were gone. (Rousing herself.) Geta, you must imprison in your heart All that might turn to quarrel with your brother. If you affront himâ GETA. (Entangling his feet in the net on the floor and kicking it away.) Is he often here? JULIA DOMNA. I sent for him. GETA. And with these bloody toils he visits you? But it is monstrous he should keep me thus Dallying his pleasure as I were not CÃ¦sar, But some rich freedman with a suit, a bribe. (He whistles and moves restlessly about.) Can we not bribe him to come down to us? (Suddenly he returns to his mother.) Something is crouching there. (He points to the throne.) JULIA DOMNA. (Drawing him closer.) . . . No, no; the door is wide, The air is free . . . GETA. You bade me leave my sword, You hurried me along. JULIA DOMNA. . . . No, no! And if there were, You are protected; you are safe As you were wrapt within my womb: I hear My breath above you. (Caracalla's steps advance.) Do not touch me, Geta, Not touch me! I am equal peace-maker. (Re-enter Caracalla.) See, Caracalla, we are here. CARACALLA. My welcome. (To Geta.) Long may you stay! So Geta, you are come. It is most wise to listen to your mother, Well-timed to yield a visit. GETA. I have yielded Nothing to you, but all her will to her. CARACALLA. We love her. She is aging with our strife. GETA. Let it be ended. CARACALLA. Yea, there shall be peace. JULIA DOMNA. May Heaven and Earth establish it! My joy Becomes full harvest. CARACALLA. That you house for rats Unless I cherish Geta. GETA. She has saidâ Only if we are friends. (Julia Domna and Geta with one accord draw close to each other.) And will maintain There is no happiness unless you prosper, And no content unless I give you love. She must embrace you while my eyes applaud, Shine on your demi-kingdom, wait complaisant While you engage the lyre, making her paean She bore Apollo in the flesh; for hours Must talk with you of Homer's verse, of Plato, While I am sought for moments of such issue As war and finance sharpen. JULIA DOMNA. Caracalla! GETA. Are you refusing peace? CARACALLA. She must be free To greet you first when there is morning sun, Me when sirocco howls, to swiftly laugh If I depart and leave you side by side . . . You say her health requires such ease, her years, Her happiness: and this is my reply. Geta Augustus, though I hate your name, Though you have stolen away half of my earth, Though you annulled my birthright and made strait My mother's earlier love, though you corrupted My father's justice, turned from me the brilliance Of every favouring star upon my chart, All competence and all prerogatives The sky could weave, laid on my life a curse, Upon my palace, on the food I eat, The wine I drink, the couch on which I sleep, The ways that I would journey down, although You have withstood my heart, withstood my will, Yet as an answer to your mother's prayer, In answer to your prayer I make replyâ Geta Augustus, we are reconciled. Nowâthe great peace! (Tarantus &amp; soldiers rush out from hiding.) GETA. O mother, treason, treason! My sword . . . O mother! (He wrings his hands.) Now you must succour. JULIA DOMNA. Geta, you are safe, Your shield! (She throws herself before him.) No altar of the living gods Is more secure. TARANTUS. (To the Soldiers, who recoil.) Kill, kill! Do not regard her, kill! (The soldiers close in round Geta, on either side; she turns back &amp; folds him in her arms.) GETA. Save me! JULIA DOMNA. Drive off these tigersâCaracalla! Traitor, traitor . . . No, no! Caracalla, So many swordsâand one is at my heart. (Geta falls back dead in her arms from a stroke given by Caracalla, who has seized Tarantus' sword.) JULIA DOMNA. Ha, never, never, never! (She shrieks &amp; moans.) Geta! I cannot hold him any more, He pulls me to the earth. (She sinks down, then lays him on the floor &amp; gazes at him, her arms stretched wide out.) Deadâin the daylightâ A corpse! (Tarantus &amp; the soldiers go out. Julia Domna remains with wide arms &amp; fixed eyes; suddenly she cries out in a small wailing voice.) Back to my lap, my bosom, Geta, Geta! They cast him back to me, back to his mother. I cannot lull or warm him any more. (In a toneless voice, as if heard from a distance.) I am a childless woman. (Caracalla drops his sword &amp; flies.) (Moving Geta's body.) Oh, this weight! Not childless yet while I can carry it: But barren for all days to come. The wheels, The wheeling of the firmament go round Within my head, the rivers of deep gorges Roar through my ears . . . Let me not ever see him, Touch him again, or call, or recollect. Oh! (Re-enter Julia Maesa with Fadilla. As she perceives them she struggles to speak, then bows, swooning, over the body. They strive to recover her, speaking in whispers.) FADILLA. (With softly raised voice.) Princely Geta! Why did he strike his brother? JULIA DOMNA. (In a harsh murmur.) He was murdered, You snake! FADILLA. Peace, Julia, peace. I fondly love him. The soldiers gave the story. JULIA DOMNA. He was murdered; He fell between my breasts, and I am red Behold, from throat to feet. My Geta's blood! No, do not staunch it, it is all I have, And I can hear it crying. I am now No mother to him, for the cry is warm, And I am cold. I am the ice-cold Earth For him to lie against, and so his mother As nature isâa clod of clay to wrap him, But fierce as nature To take him to myself, to be the earth, And hear his blood cry up. I love the cry, I love to nurse the vengeance. There is in this Something eternal. Ever on my bosom He will be laid for the great gods to see.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Next day. The same room. Geta's body has been laid out on a couch in the centre. Pylades is bowed over it. Fadilla watches. FADILLA. (Touching him.) O Pylades, but it is morning now, Morning with outspread light that cannot enter The form we love. Your cheeks are wan as his We watch the dawn on, hopeless. Go and bathe, Take food and then return. (Pylades shakes his head &amp; does not stir. Papinian enters: he &amp; Fadilla salute silently.) . . . The livelong night She held her murdered son upon her bosom, Fondling the bright hair with her chin; sometimes She groaned from depths of cold. I chronicle, I chronicle all this. I am too aged To weep, I cannot; but I saw. At dawn She rose up from her sorrow as from sleep To make the last couch ready and herself Washed off the crust of blood from Geta's limbs. Then she departed To bring his relics forth. I did not help; I am too old, I watched her and let be. How can she face that fierce Ausonian Beast The murderer of his brother? PAPINIAN. If that moment Should pass her in its passing and not slay Indomitable she will face the years. I know her stubborn: 'tis not Rome will lose herâ The stars, the poets. Oh, she was a lamp, A lamp to Homer! Lucius Pylades! He cannot know his peril weeping Geta. What fool's devotion in a Greek, a dancer, A creature of the boards. (Fadilla speaks low to Papinian; he turns to Pylades with bowed head.) I find you noble, Worthy to be in peril. (There is sound of footsteps without: Caracalla throws open the door. He wears the purple &amp; a crown of gold rays. Soldiers follow him, but he advances into the room alone.) CARACALLA. Ha, not here! Where is my mother? I assumed my empire An hour ago. Where is she? Has she fled? Is she in hiding? By the gods of death, Give me reply. Where is she? PAPINIAN. Only now She went within to bring the relics forth Of her dead son for laying on his bier. She will return. CARACALLA. Away, gone on his business! The Senate at my disposition gathered Before the dawn, yet still she is not ready, Not waiting me. And this her preparation! (He points to the bier.) Sallow he looks and ancient as the wax That moulds us our forefathers. I could laughâ Is it not pitiful, this farce of hers? (With a shudder he casts the purple off his shoulders on the corpse.) Fall over him, obliterate! (To Fadilla.) You weepâ What are you weeping? FADILLA. Geta. CARACALLA. You shall mourn Your present death; the palace-gates are locked. FADILLA. Then no more tears. CARACALLA. This wailing when I triumph, This emptiness about the air! (Perceiving Pylades.) His Leda By the dead swanâ A Titan has prevailed, And Jove is out of greatness now; go seek him Among the wailing Stygian reeds of Dis. You have no further part to play. A chorus Of blood shall sweep up to your earsâinterpret That music as you list. For you, Papinian, There is a task, a privilege. Convoke Your gifts, raise my apology to heaven For this my deed, establishing my honour, As Seneca embodied Nero's deed Into a temple that is yet his fame. Wait death or inspiration. PAPINIAN. Death will come. Death is the inspiration of the gods To flagging mortals; it will stead me now. (To Fadilla.) Farewell, O honoured! Emperor, farewell. (Exit.) CARACALLA. Where is she? Heaven and Earth, She thinks that I shall stoop to summon her? It is the dead we call toâcall their names. (Pausing a moment before the bier.) She shall not dareâ That soft note in her voice, not that between; Nothing between us any more. Where is she, That she inflicts this beggary of empire, Turning my palace to a gulf where phantoms Have nothing for their grasp? I grow distraughtâ That waxwork and no hostess in the house. (To Pylades.) Get up; you dog, get up from off the ground, Summon Augusta to my feet. (Pylades moves to the door as Julia Domna enters in white mourning.) FADILLA. Behold. CARACALLA. Not here when I arriveâ JULIA DOMNA. (Faintly, holding out the relics.) Fadilla, take them, Place them. No, I myself. Help, Pylades. This massy cloakâwho put it down on him? PYLADES. The emperor. JULIA DOMNA. Ha! FADILLA. His brother. JULIA DOMNA. Lift it up; Cast it away. His first small flute; and here The quailing golden lyre he played at noontide Of yesterday in couple with his voice. This on his heart. . . . His sword! Oh, the keen favourite left behind, his sword, His sword, his sword! (She lays Geta's hand on the hilt, as if arming him, then without turning to Caracalla she shows the body.) There, there! CARACALLA. But he is dead, Stone-dead. He does not know you at his side. As for his funeral, he shall have pomp, Deification, the loosed eagle's wafture, Be rated as a god, be anything Sublime, immortal, since he is alive No longer, but shut from us in condition That holds against assault of love or hatred, (Coming close to the corpse.) Ay, of despairâstone-dead, without a tremor, Like the more human instrument that you Or I could strike to vibrance on his bosom. He is closed up in stone, but youâyou live, Nor can you make blank metal of your vision; Your eyes have seen me, I have caught their look In act; they could not guard you from encounter, I changed the pathway of your breath; you own The subtilty of common life between us, Though you are turned away. It is pretence That you ignore my nearness. He is dead; Jove of the Capitol, you are not! (He comes close.) JULIA DOMNA. Go! CARACALLA. From you? Is that your sentence? You forget I take no bidding now, nor will I leave you Revering thus a corpse, when I have hands Supple and envious to reach your hands, A voice that travels to your open ears. Answerâyou think to give the burial-flames All of your love, to live indifferent To me and hug the ashes, while a heat And promptitude of unavailing love Are wasted round you, love you lit yourself? Speak, for I will not suffer hollowness To haunt between us: we must signify Some truth to one another. Speak that truth. What are you, what am I? (Julia Domna remains silent.) Speak, dumbness, speak! And let me hear a human voice among These clashings in my head of phantasms And dreams I cannot wake from. When your son Pursues me, and I call upon my father, His spirit answers nothing. . . . You reply Nothing. What shall I do? Fierce beasts are answered By their fierce kind. Alone, alone with phantoms At freedom on the wind, no call returning . . . (With a shriek.) Mother! JULIA DOMNA. (Moving forward.) My son. CARACALLA. Love me, O light of day! You have a dead face for the dead; but now It breaks from death. (With clasped hands.) Love me! JULIA DOMNA. (Inclining towards the corpse as if drawn back.) He dares to ask . . . CARACALLA. Because you named the name that seals my right, Vouchsafing me your love, as to the nurture Of earth the plant is destined of the earth. Your love estates meâthere is sanctuary Of nature's closest. If you now deny it I shall become as Nero in my passion And aim a deed at you. JULIA DOMNA. (With closed eyes.) O Caracalla, The sword you threaten you have used already, And you have pierced your mother. What beyond You still could do against me were as nothing. (Suddenly fixing him with her eyes.) I made the life That you destroyed: you struck me there . . . Ah, there You struck me, Caracalla! CARACALLA. Not my mother, Gods of my native earth, not mine! O gods, I have not slain her; she has called me son Upon her living lips. (Laying hold of her robe.) Is that your substance, That tawny marble? Am I not your flesh The substance of your substance and the truth Of your donation to the earth and air? I am not an inanity, abjured To lurk in mortuary urn and blast you Sterile with ashes. Would you bury me, Or sink me from the light? But I myself, If still you stand against me will return you Your motherhood into your face as dust Of scattering fire. You touch and kiss a corpse, Then I will be a corpse and be restored, So, to your hands and lips. (He draws his dagger.) JULIA DOMNA. (Her hand on his wrist.) You may not die. More sacred is the pity for the dead Than any otherâit has rites, an altar, The pouring forth of tears that would not flow For you, deep garlands that your curse would wither, Honey you shall not drink. But we remain Upon this desert earth a son and mother. Unheard you do not cry; and yet I know not If you have cried to something holy, or A canker foul and impious in my blood, That I should have no valour to be deaf; That I should turn from my dead son to you, O wretched one, the living. CARACALLA. You are mine. JULIA DOMNA. Your mother. CARACALLA. Say I am your only son. JULIA DOMNA. Who breathes, who is alive. CARACALLA. You love me? JULIA DOMNA. Loveâ With a wild anguish Earth the Mother sanctions, But not the gods. (She draws back from him.) CARACALLA. You cannot touch nor kiss Your living son? You stand And waver from one spot, as if a spirit Holding the ground and flaming like a flame. Can we not join? Am I alone for ever? JULIA DOMNA. It is because you live and by your life I love you, by a spell that is your own, My present and my future. Desolate, My first-born; I am with you to the end. I live for you, I kiss you. CARACALLA. (Embracing her.) And the years Begin afresh, wide-swept of rivalry. Hence with the past; burn it or deify, Hack, murder, silence it! We have no pastâ Mother and only son as on the day You gave me birth. So we begin, nor sunder On wrong you do me any more. Your crime Lies there encased in prison, soon to crumble In the flames' pure flagration. All who fostered My rival's cause shall perish. (Julia Domna raises her hands.) No entreaty, No boon to-day! There must be sacrifice; For my propitiation blood must flow. The servants of the dead shall serve him yonder, Faithful among the fuming shoals. There, Getaâ JULIA DOMNA. Peace, peace! CARACALLA. Shall have dominion, for such empire I neither ask nor envy: but at last When we must meet again let him beware, And dread annihilation. The white field-flowers Will nod to shrieking spirits in that conflict, And tumult roar through hell. I am not mad . . . This is bare reason, to have washed our love Clean in his blood, my kingdom in the bloodshed Of all his lovers, all his parasites. Swift I send forth obliteration, dropping Its mandate on the past. Earth groans with fuel Waiting the death-fires. (Throwing his golden wreath at her feet.) Imperatrix, hail! (Exit.) JULIA DOMNA. (To Fadilla &amp; Pylades.) Hence, hide yourselves. FADILLA. We are already chosen; We go to Geta's kingdom. JULIA DOMNA. I would save you And cannot; for these billows rage across A vessel that is sinking in the main. (Going up to the bier.) I can invoke no gods: but, see, his beauty! Praise him a little. . . . Ah, you have no voices; You both are deadâand yet I found this child More wonderful and gracious than a god, Gentler to smile on . . . and there is no praise. A PASSING VOICE. (Without.) The soldiers' glaives were naked. ANOTHER VOICE. Flee! ANOTHER. We cannot; The palace-doors are bolted. JULIA DOMNA. Massacre! But he can make the earth a ball of bloodâ And I have let him pass. But hear, but listen! The shrieks begin, begin far off, begin In Geta's palace. FADILLA. Calm yourself: the sound Is far away. Here there will be no sound. Comfort your dead. (Distant cries &amp; shrieks.) JULIA DOMNA. But listen, for the air Is shaking with a tremor, Like the tremor of an earthquake. Far away!â You cannot hear . . . It knocks against the heart. Will he destroy all room? Oh listen, listen! This mighty wave of blood must break before me, Break in my sight . . . The little interval, The pause is cruellest . . . But now the clamour Is walking fast nor halts. Where is Papinian? (Cries &amp; shrieks roll closer down the passages.) A VOICE. (Without.) Not one of them escapes! Strike them all down, All Geta's friends! JULIA DOMNA. That is Tarantus' voice, Not his! (Drawing Fadilla to her.) Embrace me, clasp me, do this latest honour To one who is accursed. PYLADES. While I am in my blood, Before I break to thee in Hades, Getaâ (He kisses his hands.) No more to dance to thee; in the lone reeds To wander with thee and be still for ever, For ever to be still and wandering! (He rises &amp; meets Tarantus &amp; the Centurions as they rush in.) TARANTUS. The pantomime! CENTURION. Where is he? TARANTUS. (Pointing to Pylades.) Quick! (They stab him: he falls dead at Geta's feet: then they turn hissing toward Fadilla. But, at their approach, with a deep sigh she drops down, through Julia Domna's arms, to the ground.) JULIA DOMNA. Refrain! For death has taken her himself. Behold! Oh, stay a little, for my ears are stunned; Do reverence to this deadâAurelius' daughter. Oh, stay! I cannot bear the fume, the noiseâ It is enough. TARANTUS. Swift! Is Papinian slain? Seek all the far apartments. (Exeunt. Julia Domna buries her face in her hands.) JULIA DOMNA. . . . But my ears Are crushed and trampled on; they are as wounds That hear o'erhead the tramp of cavalry, And do not feel the hoof . . . There are no cries. The wave of blood laps now upon the shore, All its peace riding past . . . it soaks the sand, It can no more accumulate, no more Go rolling on, no more arrest itself Stony, o'erhanging ere it ebb away. It cannot! It is spread down, away. Deliverance! (She sits by Geta abstractedly, as if by his grave.) O blessing, blessing! How you fall blessing on me! Here is all The source of the quiet. And I must not drink, Though it is close beside me. (After a while she raises herself, startled. Caracalla re-enters, staggering, &amp; uncertain: he reels toward his mother.) CARACALLA. I am ill. The sun has struck meâin the streets The sun has struck me . . . I am sated now, Giddy from slaughter . . . Mother, you must rule, I am too spent. I must take sleep. I am heavy With one gigantic dream. You must give me rest, Or else there is no ruler in the world; Chaos has drowned it all. (He falls drunkenly at her feet by the crown.) JULIA DOMNA. You have need of sleep. My son, my living son, you are weary now . . . And the lids close so soft! Ye blessed gods, To see him fall asleep, my living son. THE END</field>
