      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS PRIMA. A Curtaine drawne, Earle Lassingbergh is discouered (like a Painter) painting Lucilia, who sits working on a piece of Cushion worke. Lassinberge. Welcome bright Morne, that with thy golden rayes, Reueal'st the variant colours of the world, Looke here and see if thou canst finde disper'st The glorious parts of faire Lucilia: Take them &amp; ioyne them in the heauenly Spheares, And fixe them there as an eternall light, For Louers to adore and wonder at: And this (long since) the high Gods would haue done, But that they could not bring it back againe, When they had lost so great diuinitie. Lu. You paint your flattering words Lassinbergh, Making a curious pensill of your tongue, And that faire artificiall hand of yours, Were fitter to haue painted heauens faire storie, Then here to worke on Antickes and on me: Thus for my sake, you (of a noble Earle) Are glad to be a mercinary Painter. Lass. A Painter faire Lucia? why the world With all her beautie was by painting made. Looke on the heauens colour'd with golden starres, The firmamentall ground of it, all blew. Looke on the ayre, where with a hundred changes The watry Rain-bow doth imbrace the earth. Looke on the sommer fields adorn'd with flowers, How much is natures painting honour'd there? Looke in the Mynes, and on the Easterne shore, Where all our Mettalls and deare Iems are drawne: Thogh faire themselues, made better by their foiles. Looke on that litle world, the twofold man, Whose fairer parcell is the weaker still: And see what azure vaines in stream-like forme Diuide the Rosie beautie of the skin. I speake not of the sundry shapes of beasts, The seuerall colours of the Elements: Whose mixture shapes the worlds varietie, In making all things by their colours knowne. And to conclude, Nature her selfe diuine, In all things she hath made, is a meere Painter. She kisses her hand. Now by this kisse, th'admirer of thy skill, Thou art well worthie th'onor thou hast giuen (With so sweet words) to thy eye-rauishing Art, Of which my beauties can deserue no part. Lass. Form these base Anticks where my h?d hath spearst Thy seuerall parts: if I vniting all, Had figur'd there, the true Lucilia, Then might'st thou iustly wonder at mine Art, And deuout people would from farre repaire, Like Pilgrims, with their dutuous sacrifice, Adorning thee as Regent of their loues; Here, in the Center of this Mary-gold, Like a bright Diamond I enchast thine eye. Here, vnderneath this little Rosie bush Thy crimson cheekes peers forth more faire then it. Here, Cupid (hanging downe his wings) doth sit, Comparing Cherries to thy Ruby lippes: Here is thy browe, thy haire, thy neck, thy hand, Of purpose all in seuerall shrowds disper'st: Least rauisht, I should dote on mine owne worke, Or Enuy-burning eyes should malice it. Luc. No more my Lord: see here comes Haunce our man. Enter Haunce. Haunce. We haue the finest Painter here at boord wages, that euer made Flowerdelice, and the best bed-fellow too: for I may lie all night tryumphing from corner to corner, while he goes to see the Fayries: but I for my part, see nothing; but here a strange noyse sometimes. Well, I am glad we are haunted so with Fairies: For I cannot set a cleane pump down, but I find a dollar in it in the morning. See, my Mistresse Lucilia, shee's neuer from him: I pray God he paints no pictures with her: But I hope my fellowe hireling will not be so sawcie. But we haue such a wench a comming for you (Lordings) with her woers: A, the finest wench: wink, wink, deare people, and you be wise: and shut; O shut your weeping eyes. Enter Cornelia sola, looking vpon the picture of Alberdure in a little Iewell, and singing. Enter the Doctor and the Merchant following, and hearkning to her. The Song. What thing is loue? for sure I am it is a thing, It is a prick, it is a thing, it is a prettie, prettie thing. It is a fire, it is a coale, whose flame creeps in at euery hoale. And as my wits do best deuise, Loues dwelling is in Ladies eies. Haunce. O rare wench! Cor. Faire Prince, thy picture is not here imprest, With such perfection as within my brest. Mar. Soft maister Doctor. Doct. Cornelia, by garr dis paltry marshan be too bolde, is too sawcie by garr: Foole, holde off hand foole, Let de Doctor speake. Han. Now my braue wooers, how they striue for a Iewes Trump. Doct. Madam me loue you: me desire to marry you, Me pray you not to say no. Cor. Maister Doctor, I think you do not loue me: I am sure you shall not marry me, And (in good sadnes) I must needs say no. Mar. What say you to this maister Doctor? Mistresse let me speake. That I do loue you, I dare not say, least I should offend you: That I would marry you, I had rather you should conceiue, then I should vtter: And I do liue or die vpon your Monasible, I, or no. Doct. By gar if you will see de Marshan hang himselfe say no: A good shesse by garr. Han. A filthy French iest, as I am a dutch gentleman. Mar. Mistresse, Ile bring you from Arabia, Turckie, and India, where the Sunne doth rise, Miraculous Iemmes, rare stuffes of pretious worke, To beautifie you more then all the paintings Of women with their coullour fading cheekes. Doct. You bring stuffe for her? you bring pudding. Me vit one, two, tree pence more den de price, Buy it from dee and her too by garr: By garr dow sella' dy fader for two pence more: Madam me gieue you restoratife, Me giue you tings (but toush you) make you faire: Me gieue you tings, make you strong: Me make you liue six, seauen, tree hundra yeere: You no point so Marshan. Marshan run fr? you, two, tree, foure yere together, who shal kisse you dan? who shal embrace you dan? Who shall toush your fine hand? Ã´ shall, Ã´ sweete, By garr. Mar. Indeed M. Doctor your c?modities are rare, A guard of Vrinals in the morning; A plaguie fellow at midnight; A fustie Potticarie, euer at hand with his fustian drugges, attending your pispot worship. Doct. By garr skuruy marshan, me beat dee starck dead, and make dee liue againe for sau'a de law. Han. A plaguie marshan by gar, make the doctor angre. Doct. Now madam, by my trot you be very faire. Cor. You mock me M. Doct. I know the contrary. Doct. Know? what you know? you no see your selfe, by garr me see you; me speake vatt me see; You no point speake so. Han. Peace Doctor I vise you, Do not court in my maisters hearing, you were best. Enter Flores. Flo. Where are these wooers heere? poore sillie men, Highly deceiu'd to gape for marriage heere: Onely for gaine, I haue another reache, More high then their base spirits can aspire: Yet must I vse this Doctors secret aide, That hath alreadie promist me a drug, Whose vertue shall effect my whole desires. Doct. O Mounsieur Flores, mee be your worships seruant: Mee lay my hand vnder your Lordships foote by my trot. Flor. O maister Doctor, you are welcome to vs, And you Albertus, it doth please me much, To see you vowed riualls thus agree. Doct. Agree? by my trot sheele not haue him. Ma. You finde not that in your vrins M. Doctor. Doct. Mounsieur Flores come hedder pray. Flor. What sayes maister Doctor, Haue you remembred me? Doct. I by garr: heere be de powdra, you giue de halfe at once. Flor. But are you sure it will worke the effect? Doct. Me be sure? by garr she no sooner drinke but shee hang your neck about; she stroake your beard; she nippe your sheeke, she busse your lippe by garr. Flor. What wilt thou eate me Doctor? Doct. By garr, mee must shew you de vertue by plaine demonstration. Flor. Well, tell me, is it best in wine or no? Doct. By garr de Marshan, de Marshan, I tinck he kisse my sweete mistresse. Flor. Nay pray thee Doctor speake; is't best in wine or no? Doct. O good Lort in vyne, vat else I pray you? You giue de vench to looue vatra? Be garre me be ashame of you. Flo. Well; thankes gentle Doctor: And now (my friends) I looke to day for strangers of great state, And must craue libertie to prouide for them: Painter goe, leaue your worke, and you Lucilia, Keepe you (I charge you) in your chamber close. Exeunt. Cass. and Lucilia. Haunce, see that all things be in order set; Both for our Musicke and our large Carowse: That (after our best countrie fashion) I may giue entertainment to the Prince. Han. One of your Haultboyes (sir) is out of tune. Flo. Out of tune villaine? which way? Han. Drunke (sir) ant please you. Flo. Ist night with him alreadie? Well get other Musicke. Han. So we had need in truth sir. Exit Hans. Doct. Me no trouble you by my fait, me take my leaue, see de vnmannerlie Marshan, staie by garre. Mar. Sir, with your leaue, Exit. Ile choose some other time, When I may lesse offend you with my staie. Exit. Flo. Albertus, welcome: and now Cornelia, Are we alone? looke first; I, all is safe. Daughter, I charge thee now, euen by that loue In which we haue been partiall towards thee, (Aboue thy sister, blest with bewties guifts,) Receiue this vertuous powder at my hands, And (hauing mixt it in a bowle of Wine) Giue it vnto the Prince in his carowse. I meane no villanie heerein to him, But loue to thee, wrought by that charmed cup. We are (by birth) more noble then our fortunes, Why should we then, shun any meanes we can, To raise vs to our auncient states againe? Thou art my eldest care, thou best deseru'st To haue thy imperfections helpt by loue. Corn. Then father, shall we seeke sinister meanes, Forbidden by the lawes of God and men? Can that loue prosper which is not begun By the direction of some heauenly fate? Flo. I know not; I was nere made Bishop yet: I must prouide for mine, and still preferre (Aboue all these) the honour of my house: Come therfore, no words but performe my charge. Corn. If you wil haue it so, I must consent. Exeunt. Enter Alberdure, Hyanthe, Leander and Motto. Alber. My deere Hyanthe; my content; my life; Let no new fancie change thee from my loue: And for my riuall, (whom I must not wrong) (Because he is my father and my Prince) Giue thou him honour; but giue me thy loue. O that my riuall bound me not in dutie To fauour him: then could I tell Hyanthe, That he alreadie (with importun'd suite) Hath to the Brunswick Dutchesse vow'd himselfe, That his desires are carelesse, and his thoughts Too fickle and imperious for loue; But I am silent, dutie ties my tongue. Hya: Why? thinks my ioy, my princely Alderbure Hyanthes faith stands on so weake a ground? That it will fall or bend with euerie winde? No stormes or lingring miseries shall shake it, Much lesse, vaine titles of commaunding loue. Motto. Madam dispatch him then; rid him out of this earthlie purgatorie; for I haue such a coile with him a nights; grunting and groaning in his sleepe; with O Hyanthe; my deare Hyanthe; and then hee throbs me in his armes, as if he had gotten a great iewell by the eare. Alber. Away you wag: and tel me now my loue, What is the cause Earle Cassimere (your father) Hath beene so long importunate with me, To visit Flores the braue Ieweller? Hyan. My father doth so dote on him my Lord, That he thinkes he doth honour euery man, Whom he acquaints with his perfections; Therefore (in any wise) prepare your selfe, To grace and sooth his great conceit of him: For euerie iesture, euerie word he speakes, Seemes to my father admirablie good. Lean. Indeed my Lord, his high conceipt of him, Is more then any man aliue deserues. He thinkes the Ieweller made all of Iewels: Who though he be a man of gallant spirit, Faire spoken, and well furnisht with good parts, Yet not so peerleslie to be admir'd. Enter Caissimere. Cass. Come, shall we go (my Lord) I dare assure you, You shall beholde so excellent a man, For his behauiour, for his sweete discourse, His sight in Musick, and in heauenlie Arts, Besides the cunning iudgement of his eie, In the rare secrets of all precious Iemmes, That you will sorrow you haue staide so long. Alber. Alas, whie would not then your lordships fauor, Hasten me sooner? for I long to see him, On your iudiciall commendation. Cass. Come, lets away then; go you in Hyanthe, And if my Lord the Duke come in my absence, See him (I pray) with honour entertain'd. Exeunt. Hya. I will my Lord. Leand. I will accompanie your Ladiship, if you vouchsafe it. Hya. Come good Leander. Exeunt. Enter Constantine, Katherine, Ite, Vandercleeue, with others. Const. Lord Vandercleuee, go Lord Ambassadour From vs, to the renowmed Duke of Saxon, And know his highnesse reason and intent, Whie being (of late) with such importunate suite, Bethroth'd to our faire sister Dowager Of this our Dukedome; he doth now protract The time he vrged with such speede of late, His honourd nuptiall rites to celebrate. Kath. But good my Lord, temper your Ambassie With such respectiue termes to my renowme, That I be cleer'd of all immodest haste, To haue our promist nuptials consumate: For his affects (perhaps) follow the season, Hot with the summer then, now colde with winter. And Dames (though nere so forward in desire) Must suffer men to blowe the nuptiall fire. Vander. Madam, your name (in vrging his intent) Shall not be vsd: but your right princelie brothers, Who knowing it may breede in vulgar braines (That shall giue note to this protraction) Vniust suspition of your sacred vertues, And other reasons touching the estate Of both their famous Dukedomes, sendeth mee To be resolu'd of his integritie. Const. To that end go my honourable Lord: Commend me and my sister to his loue, (If you perceiue not he neglects our owne) And bring his princelie resolution. Kat. Commend not me by any meanes my lord, Vnlesse your speedie graunted audience, And kinde entreatie make it requisite, For honour rules my nuptiall appetite. Exeunt. Finis Actus Primi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS SECVNDVS. Enter Haunce, Lassingbergh, and others following, seruing in a Bancket. Han. Come sir, it is not your painting alone, Makes your absolute man; ther's as fine a hand To be requir'd in carrying a dish, And as sweete arte to be shew'd in't, As in any maister peece whatsoeuer; Better then as you painted the Doctor eene now, With his nose in an Vrinall. Lass. Be quiet sir, or ile paint you by and by, eating my maisters comfets. Exit. Enter Flores, Cassimeere, Alberdure, Cornelia, and Motto. Flor. Prince Alberdure, my great desire to answere The greatnes of your birth, and high deserts, With entertainment fitting to your state, Makes althings seem too humble for your presence. Alber. Courteous S. Flores, your kinde welcome is Worthy the presence of the greatest Prince; And I am bound to good Earle Cassimeere, For honouring me with your desierd acquaintance. Cass. Wilt please you therefore to draw neere my lord? Flo. Wilt please your grace to sit? Alber. No good S. Flores, I am heere admiring The cunning strangenes of your antick worke: For though the generall tract of it be rough, Yet is it sprinckled with rare flowers of Art. See what a liuelie piercing eye is here; Marke the conueiance of this louelie hand; Where are the other parts of this faire cheeke? Is it not pittie that they should be hid? Flor. More pittie 'tis (my lord) that such rare art Should be obscur'd by needie pouertie, Hee's but a simple man kept in my house. Alber. Come sirra, you are a practitioner, Lets haue your iudgement here. Han. VVill you haue a stoole sir? Motto. I, and I thanke you too sir. Flo. Hath this young Gentleman such skill in drawing? Alber. Many great maisters thinke him (for his yeares exceeding cunning. Cass. Now sir, what thinke you? Mott. My Lord, I thinke more Art is shaddowed heere, Then any man in Germanie can shew, Except Earle Lassingbergh; and (in my conceipt) This worke was neuer wrought without his hand. Flo. Earle Lnssingbergh? aye me, my iealous thoughts Suspect a mischiefe, which I must preuent. Haunce, call Lucilia and the Painter strait, Bid them come both t'attend vs at our feast: Is not your Grace yet wearie of this obiect? Ile shew your Lordship things more woorth the sight, Both for their substance, and their curious Art. Alber. Thankes good sir Flores. Flor. See then (my Lord) this Aggat that containes The image of that Goddesse and her sonne: Whom auncients held the Soueraignes of Loue, See naturally wrought out of the stone, (Besides the perfect shape of euery limme, Besides the wondrous life of her bright haire,) A wauing mantle of celestiall blew, Imbroydering it selfe with flaming Starres. Alber. Most excellent: and see besides (my Lords) How Cupids wings do spring out of the stone, As if they needed not the helpe of Art. Flor. My Lord, you see all sorts of Iewels heere, I will not tire your grace with view of them; Ile onely shew you one faire Aggat more, Commended chiefely for the workmanship. Alber. O excellent; this is the very face Of Cassimeere: by viewing both at once, Either I thinke that both of them do liue, Or both of them are Images and dead. Flo. My Lord, I feare I trouble you too long, Wilt please your Lordships taste this homely cates? Corn. First, (if it please you) giue me leaue to greete Your Princely hand with this vnworthy gift: Yet woorthy, since it represents your selfe. Alber. What? my selfe Lady? trust me it is pittie So faire a Iemme should hold so rude a picture. Corn. My Lord 'tis made a Iewell in your picture, Which otherwise had not deseru'd the name. Alber. Kinde mistresse, kindly I accept your fauour. Enter Lassengbergh, Haunce, and Lucilia. Flo. Heere you young gentleman; do you know this man? Mot. Yes signior Flores, 'tis Earle Lassinbergh. Exit Han. My lord what meane you to come thus disguisd? Luc. Aye me. Lass. The foolish boye is mad, I am Cornelius; Earle Lassingbergh; I neuer heard of him. Flo. O Lassingbergh, we know your villanie, And thy dishonour (fond Lucilia,) Asse that I was, dull, sencelesse, grosse braynd foole, That dayly saw so many euident signes Of their close dealings, winckings, becks and touches, And what not? to enforce me to discerne, Had I not beene effatuate euen by Fate: Your presence noble Lords (in my disgrace) Doth deepely mooue mee: and I heere protest Most solemnly (in sight of heauen and you) That if Earle Lassingbergh this day refuse, To make faire mends for this fowle trespasse done, I will reuenge me on his treacherous heart, Though I sustaine for him a thousand deaths. Cass. This action (traitour Lassingbergh deserues Great satisfaction, or else great reuenge. Alber. Beleeue me gallant Earle your choice is faire, And worthy your most honourable loue. Lassin. My Lord, it greeues me to be thus vnmaskt, And made ridiculous in the stealth of loue: But (for Lucilias honour) I protest, (Not for the desperate vowe that Flores made) She was my wife before she knew my loue By secret promise, made in sight of heauen. The marriage which he vrgeth, I accept, But this compulsion and vnkinde disgrace, Hath altered the condition of my loue, And filde my heart with yrksome discontent. Flor. My Lord, I must preferre mine honour still, Before the pleasure of the greatest Monarch; Which since your Lordship seekes to gratifie With iust and friendly satisfaction; I will endeuour to redeeme the thought Of your affection, and lost loue to vs: Wilt please you therefore now to associate This woorthy Prince, at this vnwoorthy banquet? Alber. My Lord let me intreate your company. Lassin. Hold mee excusd faire Prince; my grieued thoughts Are farre vnmeete for festiuall delights: Heere will I sit and feede on melancholie, A humour (now) most pleasing to my taste. Flor. Lucilia, waite the pleasure of your loue: My Lord, now to the banquet, Daughter commaund vs a carowse of wine. Musick sounds a while; and they sing, Boire a le Fountaine. Flor. My Lord; I greete you with this first carowse, And as this wine (the Elements sweete soule) Shall growe in me to bloud and vitall spirit, So shall your loue and honor growe in me. Alber. I pledge you sir. Caff. How like you him my Lord? Alber. Exceeding well. Sing boyre a le fountaine. Flor. Cornelia, do you serue the Prince with wine? Shee puts the powder into the Cup and giues it the Prince. Alber. I thanke you Lady. Earle Cassimeere, I greete you; and remember Your faire Hyanthe. Cass. I thanke your honour. Sing boyre a, &amp;c. Flor. Fill my Lord Cassimere his right of wine. Cass. Cornelia, I giue you this dead carowse. Corn. I thanke your Lordship. Sing boyre a, &amp;c. Alber. What smoake? smoake and fire. Cass. What meanes your honour? Alber. Powder, powder, Etna, Sulphure, fier; quench it, quench it. Flor. I feare the medcine hath distemper'd him, O villaine Doctor. Alber. Downe with the battlements, powre water on, I burne, I burne; O giue me leaue to flie Out of these flames; these fiers that compasse me. Exit. Cass. What an vnheard off accident is this? Would God friend Flores, t'had not happen'd heere. Flor. My Lord, 'tis sure some Planet striketh him, No doubt the furie will away againe. Caff. Ile follow him. Exit. Lass. What hellish spright ordain'd this hateful feast, That ends with horror thus and discontent? Flor. I hope no daunger will succeede therein: How euer, I resolue me to conceale it. My Lord, wilt please you now to change this habit. And deck your selfe with ornaments more fit For celebration of your marriage. Lass. I, I, put on me what attire you will, My discontent, that dwels within me still. Exeunt. Enter Haunce solus. Hans. Whom shall a man trust? a Painter? no.

Enter Alphonso, Hardenbergh, Hoscherman, with others. &amp;c. Hard. The Ambassador of Brunswick (good my lord) Begins to murmure at his long delayes. Hosc. Twere requisit your highnes wold dismisse him. Alph. Who holds him? let him go. Hard. My Lord you know, his message is more great Then to depart so slightly without answer, Vrging the marriage that your grace late sought With Katherine, sister to the Saxon Duke. Hosk. Whom if your highnes should so much neglect, As to forsake his sister and delude him, Considering already your olde iarre, With the stoute Lantsgraue, What harmes might ensue? Alph. How am I crost? Hyanthe'ts for thee, That I neglect the Duchesse and my vowes. Hard. My Lord, 'twere speciallie conuenient Your Grace would satisfie th'embassador. Alph. Well, call him in. Hosk. But will your Highnes then forsake Hyanthe? Alph. Nothing lesse Hosk. Hosk. How will you then content th'embassador? Alph. I will delaie him with some kinde excuse. Hard. What kinde excuse my Lord? Alph. For that let me alone: do thou but soothe, What I my selfe will presently deuise, And I will send him satisfied away. Hard. Be sure (my Lord) Ile footh what ere you say. Alph. Then let them come, we are prouided for th?. Enter Vandercleeue the Ambassador attended. Alph. My lord Ambassador, we are right sorrie, Our vrgent causes haue deferd you thus: In the dispatch of that we most desire. But for your answer: Know I am deterr'd By many late prodigious ostents, From present consumation of the nuptials, Vowd twixt your beautious Dutchesse and our selfe, O what colde feare mens iealous stomacks feele In that they most desire: suspecting still, 'Tis eyther too too sweete to take effect, Or (in th'effect) must meete with some harshe chaunce To interuent the ioye of the successe. The same wisht day (my Lord) you heere arriu'd, I bad Lord Hardenbergh commaund two horse, Should priuately be brought for me and him, To meete you on the waye for honours sake, And to expresse my ioye of your repaire. When (loe:) the horse I vsd to ride vpon, (That would be gently backt at other times,) Now offring but to mount him; stood aloft, Flinging and bound: you know Lord Hardenburgh. Hard. Yes my good Lord. Alph. And was so strangely out of wonted rule, That I could hardlie back him. Hard. True my liege: I stood amaz'd at it. Alph. Well, yet I did; And riding (not a furlong) downe he fell. Hard. That neuer heeretofore would trip with him, Alph. Yet would I forward needs: but Hardenbergh More timorous then wise, as I supposed, (For loue so hardned me, feare was my slaue) Did ominate such likelie ill to me, If I went forward, that with much enforcement Of what might chance, he draue me to retreat, Didst thou not Hardenbergh? Hard. I did my Lord. Alph. Yet all the euents &amp; reasons vrgd, thou sawest, Would scarcelie worke on me a mightie while. Hard. 'Tis true my Lord. Alph. I warrant thou wilt say, Thou neuer yet saw'st any man so loathe To be perswaded ill, of so ill signes. Hard. Neuer in all my life. Alph. Thou wonderst at it? Hard. I did indeed my liege, not without cause. Alph. O blame not Hardenbergh: for thou dost know, How sharpe my heart was set, to entertaine The Lord of this Ambassage louingly. Hard. True my good Lord. Alph. But (comming back) how gently the Iade went, Did he not Hardenbergh? Hard. As any horse on earth could do my Lord. Alph. Well sir, this drew me into deepe conceit, And to recomfort me, I did commaund Lord Hardenbergh should ope a Cabanet, Of my choise Iewels, and to bring me thence A ring: a riche and Violet Hiacinthe, Whose sacred vertue is to cheere the heart, And to excite our heauie spirits to mirthe, With putting on my finger swift, did breake, Now this indeed did much discomfort me: And heauie to the death, I went to bed, Where in a slumber I did strongly thinke, I should be married to the beautious Dutchesse: And comming to my Chappell, to that end, Duke Constantine her brother with his Lords And all our peeres (me thought) attending vs, Forth comes my princelie Katherine, led by death, Who threatning me, stood close vnto her side, Vrging by those most horrible portents, That wedding her, I married mine owne death: I frighted in my sleepe, strugled and sweat. And in the violence of my thoughts, cryed out So lowde, that Hardenberghe awakt, and rose. Didst thou not Hardenberghe? Hard. I felt I did, for neuer yet (my Lord) Was I in heart and soule so much dismaide. Alph. Why thus you see (my Lord) how your delaies, Were mightilie, &amp; with huge cause enforste. Amb. But dreames (my lord) you know growe by the humors Of the moist night, which store of vapours lending Vnto our stomaches when we are in sleepe, And to the bodies supreame parts ascending, Are thence sent back by coldnesse of the braine, And these present our idle phantasies With nothing true, but what our labouring soules Without their actiue organs, falselie worke. Alp. My Lord, know you, there are two sorts of dreams, One sort whereof are onely phisicall, And such are they whereof your Lordship speakes, The other Hiper-phisicall: that is, Dreames sent from heauen, or from the wicked fiends, Which nature doth not forme of her owne power, But are extrinsecate, by maruaile wrought, And such was mine: yet notwithstanding this, I hope fresh starres will gouerne in the spring, And then assure our princelie friend your maister, Our promise in all honour shall be kept: Returne this answere Lord Ambassador, And recommend me to my sacred loue. Amb. I will my lord: but how it will be accepted I know not yet, your selfe shall shortly heare. Exeunt all but Alph. Alph. Lords some of you associate him, ha, ha, Come Hardenbergh, was not this well deuis'd? Hard. Exceeding well, and grauelie good my lord. Alp. Come lets go and visit my Hianthe, She whose perfections, are of power to mooue The thoughts of CÃ¦sar (did he liue) to loue. Exeunt. Finis Actus secundus.</field>

Wilt thou not cease then to pursue me still, Should I entreate thee to attend me thus, Then thou wouldst pant and rest; then your soft feete, Would be repining at these niggard stones: Now I forbid thee, thou pursuest like winde, Ne tedious space of time, nor storme can tire thee, But I will seeke out some high slipperie close, Where euery step shall reache the gate of death, That feare may make thee cease to follow me. Luc. There will I bodilesse be, when you are there, For loue despiseth death, and scorneth feare. Lass. Ile wander where some boysterous riuer parts This solid continent, and swim from thee. Luc. And there Ile follow, though I drowne for thee. Lass. But I forbid thee. Luc. I desire thee more. Lass: Art thou so obstinate? Luc. You taught me so. Lass. I see thou louest me not. Luc.

Why do I straine to wearie thee with words? Speech makes thee liue; Ile then with silence kill thee: Henceforth be deafe to thy words, And dumbe to thy minde. Ench. What rock hath bred this sauage minded man? That such true loue, in such rare beautie shines, Long since I pittied her: pittie breeds loue; And loue commaunds th'assistance of my Art, T'enclude them in the bounds of my commaund. Heere stay your wandring steps: clime siluer strings, Chime hollow caues, and chime you whistling reedes, For musick is the sweetest chime for loue: Spirits binde him, and let me leaue my loue. Exeunt. Enter Aberdure at one doore, and meetes with the Pesant at the other doore. Alb. Hyanthe, Ã´ sweete Hyanthe, haue I met thee? How is thy beautie changed since our departure? A beard Hyanthe? Ã´ tis growne with griefe, But now this loue shall teare thy griefe from thee. Pea. A pox on you: what are you? Swounds I thinke I am haunted with spirits. Alb. Weepe not Hyanthe; Ile weepe for thee: Lend me thy eyes, no villaine thou art he That in the top of Eruines hill: Daunst with the Moone, and eate vp all the starres, Which make thee like Hyanthe shine so faire, But villaine, I will rip them out of thee. Enter Motto and others. Pea. Slid holde your hands. Alp. I come with thunder. Pea. Come and you dare. Mott. Holde villaine, tis the young prince Alberdure. Pea. Let the young Prince hold then, slid I haue no starres in my bellie, I, let him seeke his Hyanthe where he will. Alb. O this way by the glimmering of the Sunne, And the legierite of her sweete feete, Shee scowted on, and I will follow her, I see her like a goulden spangle sit, Vpon the curled branche of yonder tree, Sit still Hyanthe, I will flie to thee. Exit. Mott. Follow, follow, follow. Exeunt all but Peas. Enter Flores and Homer. Pea. Together and be hanged O, Heere comes more, pray God I haue better lucke with these two. By your leaue sir, do you know one Maist. Flores I pray? Flo. What wouldst thou haue with him? Pea.

He stole it sir I warrant you. Flo. I neuer sawe a Iemme so precious: So wonderfull in substance and in Art: Fellow confesse preciselie, where thou hadst it. Pea. Faith sir, I had it in a caue in the bottome of a fine greene hill, where I found a company of Fairies, I thinke they call them. Flo. Sawst thou any more such furniture there? Pea. Store sir, store. Elo. And canst thou bring me thither? Pea. With a wet finger sir. Han. And ha they good cheere too? Pea. Excellent. Han. O sweete theefe. Flo. Tis sure some place enchanted, which this ring Will soone dissolue, and guard me free from feare: Heer's for the cup, come guide me quickly thither.

Ench. Lie there, and lose the memorie of her, Who likewise hath forgot the thought of thee By my inchantments: come sit downe faire Nimphe And taste the sweetnesse of these heauenly cates, Whilst from the hollow craines of this rocke, Musick shall sound to recreate my loue. But tell me had you euer louer yet? Luc. I had a louer I thinke, but who it was, Or where, or how long since, aye me, I know not: Yet beat my timerous thoughts on such a thing, I feele a passionate heate, but finde no flame: Thinke what I know not, nor know what I thinke. Ench. Hast thou forgot me then? I am thy loue, Whom sweetly thou wert wont to entertaine, With lookes, with vowes of loue, with amorous kisses, Lookst thou so strange, doost thou not know me yet? Luc. Sure I should know you. Ench. Why loue, doubt you that? Twas I that lead you through the painted meades, Where the light Fairies daunst vpon the flowers, Hanging on euery leafe an orient pearle, Which strooke together with the silken winde, Of their loose mantels made a siluer chime. Twas I that winding my shrill bugle horne, Made a guilt pallace breake out of the hill, Filled suddenly with troopes of knights and dames, Who daunst and reueld whilste we sweetly slept, Vpon a bed of Roses wrapt all in goulde, Doost thou not know me yet? Luc. Yes now I know you. Ench. Come then confirme thy knowledge with a kis. Luc. Nay stay, you are not he, how strange is this. Enbh. Thou art growne passing strange my loue, To him that made thee so long since his bride. Luc. O was it you? come then, Ã´ stay a while, I know not where I am, nor where I am, Nor you, nor these I know, nor any thing. Enter Flores with Hance and the Peasant. Pea. This is the greene Sir where I had the Cup, And this the bottome of a falling hill, This way I went following the sound: And see. Hanc. O see, and seeing, eate withall. Flo. What Lassenbergh laid bound, and fond Lucilla Wantonly feasting by a strangers side, Peasant be gone, Hance stand you there and stir not, Now sparckle forth thy beams thou vertuous Iemme, And lose these strong enchauntments. Ench. Stay, aye me: VVe are betrai'd, haste spirits and remoue This table and these cups remoue I say, Our incantations strangely are dissolu'd. Exeunt Ench, with spirits and banquets. Hanc. O spightfull churles, haue they caried away all? has haste made no waste? Luc. My Lord Earle Lassenbergh, Ã´ pardon me. Lass. Away from me. Luc. O can I in these bands, forget the Dutie of my loue to you? were they Of Iron, or strong Adamant, my hands Should teare them from my wronged Lord. Flo. O Lassenbergh, to what vndoubted perrill, Of life and honour had you brought your selfe, By obstinacie of your froward minde? Had not my fortune brought me to this place, To lose the enchantment, which enthralled you both, By hidden vertue of this precious ring. Come therefore friendly, and imbrace at last The liuing partner of your strange mishaps, Iustly pursuing you for flying her. Lass. Leaue me I say, I can endure no more. Lu. Ah, haue I loos'd thee then, to flie from mee? Lass. Away. Exit. Lu. Ile follow thee. Flo. Tarrie Lucilia. Lu. Deare father pardon mee. Exit. Flo. Sirah, attend her poore wretch, I feare this too much loue in thee, is fatall to thee: Vp sirrah, follow your mistresse. Han. I sir, I go, my mistresse dogs the banket, And I dog her. Exeunt. Finis.

O Madam, neuer were our teares bestowed Of one whose death was worthier to be mon'd, Deere Alberdure, why parted I from thee? And did not like the faithfull Pilades, Attend my deere Orestes in his rage. Hya.

Enter Alber. with a basket of Apricocks disguised. Alber. In this disguise, Ile secretly enquire, Why I was so forsaken of my friend, And left to danger of my lunacie: Here is the man, that most I blame for this, Whose vowed friendship promisd greater care: But he it seemes enamour'd of my loue; Was glad of that occasion, and I feare: Hath turned her womanish conceipt from me, Ile prooue them both. Maister wilt please you Buie a basket of well riped Apricocks? Lea. I pray thee keepe thy dainties, I am full Of bitter sorrowes, as my hart can holde. Alb. It may be maister your faire Lady will? Hya. No friend, my stomack is more full then his. Lea. Where dwellest thou friend? Alb. Not farre from hence my Lord. Lea. Then thou knowest well which was the fatall streame Wherein the young prince Alberdure was drownd? Alb. I know not he was drownd: but oft haue seene The pittious manner of his lunacie. In depth whereof he still would eccho forth, A Ladies name that I haue often heard, Beautious Hyanthe, but in such sad sort, As if his frenzie felt some secret touch, Of her vnkindnesse and inconstancie: And when his passions somewhat were appeaz'd, Affoording him (it seemd) some truer sence Of his estate; left in his fittes alone: Then would he wring his hands, extreamly weeping, Exclaiming on the name of one Leander, Calling him Traitor and vnworthie friend, So to forsake him in his miserie. Lea. Accursed I, Ã´ thou hast mooued me more, Then if a thousand shewers of venom'd darts, With seuerall paines at once had prickt my soule. Hya. O thou ordaind, to beare swords in thy toung, Dead thou hast struck me, and I liue no more. Alb. It seemes your honoures loued him tenderly. Lea. O my good friend, knewst thou how deer I loued him. Hya. Nay knewst thou honest friend, How deere I loued him. Alb. I see then, you would reioyce at his health? Lea. As at my life, were it reuiued from death. Hya. As at my soule, were it preseru'd from hell. Alb. Be then from death and hell recouered both, As I am now by your firme loues to me: Admire me not, I am that Alberdure Whom you thought drownde, That friend, that loue, am I. Lea. Pardon sweete friend. Hya. Pardon my princely loue. Alb. Deare loue, no further gratulations now, Least I be seene, and knowne: but sweete Leander, Do you conceale me in thy fathers house, That I may now remaine with my Hyanthie, And at our pleasures safely ioy each others loue. Lea. I will (deare friend) and blesse my happy stars, That giue me meanes to so desir'de a deed. Finis Actus quarti.</field>

My loue and life, did my deere sonne suruiue. Lea. But were he found, or should he liue my Lord, Although Hyanthes loue were the chiefe cause Of his mishap, and amourous lunacie, I hope your highnesse loues him ouer well, To let him repossesse his wits with her. Alp. My loue is dead, in sorrow for his death, His life and wits, should ransome worlds from me. Lea.

My Lord, the Duke himselfe is come to vrge Your promise to him, which you must not breake. Hosch. Nor will you wish to breake it good my lord? I am assur'd, when you shall see the Dutchesse, Whose matchlesse beauties will renew the minde, Of her rare entertainment, and her presence, Put all new thoughts of loue out of your minde. Alp. Well I do see 'tis best, my sweete Hyanthie, That thou stand further. Hya. Ile be gone my Lord. Alp. Not gone, but mixe thy selfe among the rest, What a spight is this: Counsell me Hardenbergh. Hard. The Dutchesse comes my Lord. Alp. Out of my life, how shall I looke on her? Enter Constan. Kather. Lassen. Lucil. Cassi. Cornelia, Ite, a Songe: after the Dutchesse speakes. Kat. How now my Lord, you looke as one dismaid, Haue any visions troubled you of late? Alp. Your grace, &amp; your most princely brother here, Are highlie welcome to the Saxon Court. Kath. O you dissemble sir: Nor are we come in hope of welcome, But with this poore head-peece, To beare the brunt of all discurtesies. Const. My Lorde, wee come not now to vrge the marriage You sought with such hot suite, of my faire Sister; But to resolue our selues, and all the world, Why you retained such meane conceipt of vs, To slight so solemne and so high a contract, With vaine pretext of visions or of dreames. Alp. My Lord, I heare protest by earth and heauen, I holde your state right mightie and renowned, And your faire sisters beauties and deserts, To be most worthy the greatest king aliue, Onlie an ominous vision troubled me, And hindred the wisht speede I would haue made, Not to dissolue it, though it were diferd, By such portents (as least you thinke I faine) Lord Hardenbergh can witnesse is most true. Hard. Most true my Lord, and most prodigious. Alp. Yet Ile contemne them with my life and all, Ere Ile offend your grace or breed suspect Of my firme faith, in my most honoured loue. Kath. No, no, my Lord, this is your vision, That hath not frighted but enamoured you. Alp. O Madame, thinke you so, by heauen I sweare, Shee's my sonnes loue: sirra take her to you, Haue I had all this care to do her grace, To prooue her vertues, and her loue to thee, And standst thou fearefull now? take her I say. Lea. My Lord, he feares you will be angry with him. Alp. You play the villaine, wherfore should he feare? I onely proued her vertues for his sake, And now you talke of anger, aye me wretche, That euer I should liue to be thus shamed? Alb. Madame, I sweare, the Ladie is my loue, Therefore your highnesse cannot charge my father, With any wrong to your high woorth in her. Con. Sister, you see me vtterly mistake the kinde And princelie dealing of the Duke: Therefore without more ceremonious doubts, Lets reconfirme the contract and his loue. Kath. I warrant you my Lord the Duke dissembles. Alp. Heere on my knees, at the Altar of those feete, I offer vp in pure and sacred breath, The true speech of my hart, and hart it selfe. Require no more, if thou be princelie borne, And not of Rockes, or ruthelesse Tygers bred. Kath. My Lord, I kindlie crie you mercy now, Ashamed that you should iniurie your estate, To kneele to me: and vowe before these Lords To make you all amends you can desire. Flo. Madame, in admiration of your Grace And princelie wisedom: and to gratifie The long wisht ioye, done to my Lord the Duke, I here present your highnesse with this Cup, Wrought admirablie by th'art of Spirits, Of substance faire, more riche then earthly Iemmes, Whose valew no mans iudgement can esteeme. Alp. Flores, Ile interrupt the Dutchesse thankes, And for the present thou hast giuen to her, To strengthen her consent to my desires, I recompence thee with a free release, Of all offences twixt thy selfe and me. Flo. I humblie thanke your Excellence. Kath. But where is now vnkinde Earle Lassinbergh? That iniuries his faire loue, and makes her weare This worthlesse garlande come sir make amends, Or we will heere awarde you worthie penance. Lass. Madame, since her departure I haue done More hartie penance then her hart could wish, And vowe hereafter to liue euer hers. Kat. Then let vs cast aside these forlorne wreathes, And with our better fortunes change our habits. Enter Doctor in poste, the Marchant following him. Doct. O stay my Lorte, me pray you on knee, vor staie. Alp. What's the matter Doctor? Doct. O me bret be garr, for haste. Con. What ayles the hastie Doctor? Doct. My Lorte be garr he lyes falslie in his troate, Me prooue by the duell dat he be the fallce knaue. Alp. Who is it man, with whom thou art so bold? Doct. My Lorte, if me make my contrack of marriage, if me be not as loose as de vide worlde, if me doe not alleadge. Alp. I praie thee man what meanest thou? Doct. Be garr enforme your grace vat he dare, I will prooue by good argument and raison, dat he is de fallce beggerlie Ieweller, dat I no point marrie Cornelia; vat say you now? Cass.
