      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. ANTHONY BABINGTON. Scene I. Babington's Lodging: a veiled picture on the wall. Enter Babington, Tichborne, Tilney, Abington, Salisbury, and Barnwell. Babington. Welcome, good friends, and welcome this good day That casts out hope and brings in certainty To turn raw spring to summer. Now not long The flower that crowns the front of all our faiths Shall bleach to death in prison; now the trust That took the night with fire as of a star Grows red and broad as sunrise in our sight Who held it dear and desperate once, now sure, But not more dear, being surer. In my hand I hold this England and her brood, and all That time out of the chance of all her fate Makes hopeful or makes fearful: days and years, Triumphs and changes bred for praise or shame From the unborn womb of these unknown, are ours That stand yet noteless here; ours even as God's Who puts them in our hand as his, to wield And shape to service godlike. None of you But this day strikes out of the scroll of death And writes apart immortal; what we would, That have we; what our fathers, brethren, peers, Bled and beheld not, died and might not win, That may we see, touch, handle, hold it fast, May take to bind our brows with. By my life, I think none ever had such hap alive As ours upon whose plighted lives are set The whole good hap and evil of the state And of the Church of God and world of men And fortune of all crowns and creeds that hang Now on the creed and crown of this our land, To bring forth fruit to our resolve, and bear What sons to time it please us; whose mere will Is father of the future. Tilney. Have you said? Babington. I cannot say too much of so much good. Tilney. Say nothing then a little, and hear one while: Your talk struts high and swaggers loud for joy, And safely may perchance, or may not, here; But why to-day we know not. Babington. No, I swear, Ye know not yet, no man of us but one, No man on earth; one woman knows, and I, I that best know her the best begot of man And noblest; no king born so kingly-souled, Nor served of such brave servants. Tichborne. What, as we? Babington. Is there one vein in one of all our hearts That is not blown aflame as fire with air With even the thought to serve her? and, by God, They that would serve had need be bolder found Than common kings find servants. Salisbury. Well, your cause? What need or hope has this day's heat brought forth To blow such fire up in you? Babington. Hark you, sirs; The time is come, ere I shall speak of this, To set again the seal on our past oaths And bind their trothplight faster than it is With one more witness; not for shameful doubt, But love and perfect honour. Gentlemen, Whose souls are brethren sealed and sworn to mine, Friends that have taken on your hearts and hands The selfsame work and weight of deed as I, Look on this picture; from its face to-day Thus I pluck off the muffled mask, and bare Its likeness and our purpose. Ay, look here; None of these faces but are friends of each, None of these lips unsworn to all the rest, None of these hands unplighted. Know ye not What these have bound their souls to? and myself, I that stand midmost painted here of all, Have I not right to wear of all this ring The topmost flower of danger? Who but I Should crown and close this goodly circle up Of friends I call my followers? There ye stand, Fashioned all five in likeness of mere life, Just your own shapes, even all the man but speech, As in a speckless mirror; Tichborne, thou, My nearest heart and brother next in deed, Then Abington, there Salisbury, Tilney there, And Barnwell, with the brave bright Irish eye That burns with red remembrance of the blood Seen drenching those green fields turned brown and grey Where fire can burn not faith out, nor the sword That hews the boughs off lop the root there set To spread in spite of axes. Friends, take heed; These are not met for nothing here in show Nor for poor pride set forth and boastful heart To make dumb brag of the undone deed, and wear The ghost and mockery of a crown unearned Before their hands have wrought it for their heads Out of a golden danger, glorious doubt, An act incomparable, by all time's mouths To be more blessed and cursed than all deeds done In this swift fiery world of ours, that drives On such hot wheels toward evil goals or good, And desperate each as other; but that each, Seeing here himself and knowing why here, may set His whole heart's might on the instant work, and hence Pass as a man rechristened, bathed anew And swordlike tempered from the touch that turns Dull iron to the two-edged fang of steel Made keen as fire by water; so, I say, Let this dead likeness of you wrought with hands Whereof ye wist not, working for mine end Even as ye gave them work, unwittingly, Quicken with life your vows and purposes To rid the beast that troubles all the world Out of men's sight and God's. Are ye not sworn Or stand not ready girt at perilous need To strike under the cloth of state itself The very heart we hunt for? Tichborne. Let not then Too high a noise of hound and horn give note How hot the hunt is on it, and ere we shoot Startle the royal quarry; lest your cry Give tongue too loud on such a trail, and we More piteously be rent of our own hounds Than he that went forth huntsman too, and came To play the hart he hunted. Babington. Ay, but, see, Your apish poet's-likeness holds not here, If he that fed his hounds on his changed flesh Was charmed out of a man and bayed to death But through pure anger of a perfect maid; For she that should of huntsmen turn us harts Is Dian but in mouths of her own knaves, And in paid eyes hath only godhead on And light to dazzle none but them to death. Yet I durst well abide her, and proclaim As goddess-like as maiden. Barnwell. Why, myself Was late at court in presence, and her eyes Fixed somewhile on me full in face; yet, 'faith. I felt for that no lightning in my blood Nor blast in mine as of the sun at noon To blind their balls with godhead; no, ye see, I walk yet well enough. Abington. She gazed at you? Barnwell. Yes, 'faith; yea, surely; take a Puritan oath To seal my faith for Catholic. What, God help, Are not mine eyes yet whole then? am I blind Or maimed or scorched, and know not? by my head, I find it sit yet none the worse for fear To be so thunder-blasted. Abington. Hear you, sirs? Tichborne. I was not fain to hear it. Barnwell. Which was he Spake of one changed into a hart? by God, There be some hearts here need no charm, I think, To turn them hares of hunters; or if deer, Not harts but hinds, and rascal. Babington. Peace, man, peace! Let not at least this noble cry of hounds Flash fangs against each other. See what verse I bade write under on the picture here: These are my comrades, whom the peril's self Draws to it; how say you? will not all in the end Prove fellows to me? how should one fall off Whom danger lures and scares not? Tush, take hands; It was to keep them fast in all time's sight I bade my painter set you here, and me Your loving captain; gave him sight of each And order of us all in amity. And if this yet not shame you, or your hearts Be set as boys' on wrangling, yet, behold, I pluck as from my heart this witness forth [Taking out a letter. To what a work we are bound to, even her hand Whom we must bring from bondage, and again Be brought of her to honour. This is she, Mary the queen, sealed of herself and signed As mine assured good friend for ever. Now, Am I more worth or Ballard? Tilney. He it was Bade get her hand and seal to allow of all That should be practised; he is wise. Babington. Ay, wise! He was in peril too, he said, God wot, And must have surety of her, he; but I, 'Tis I that have it, and her heart and trust, See all here else, her trust and her good love Who knows mine own heart of mine own hand writ And sent her for assurance. Salisbury. This we know; What we would yet have certified of you Is her own heart sent back, you say, for yours. Babington. I say? not I, but proof says here, cries out Her perfect will and purpose. Look you, first She writes me what good comfort hath she had To know by letter mine estate, and thus Reknit the bond of our intelligence, As grief was hers to live without the same This great while past; then lovingly commends In me her own desire to avert betimes Our enemies' counsel to root out our faith With ruin of us all; for so she hath shown All Catholic princes what long since they have wrought Against the king of Spain; and all this while The Catholics naked here to all misuse Fall off in numbered force, in means and power, And if we look not to it shall soon lack strength To rise and take that hope or help by the hand Which time shall offer them; and see for this What heart is hers! she bids you know of me Though she were no part of this cause, who holds Worthless her own weighed with the general weal, She will be still most willing to this end To employ therein her life and all she hath Or in this world may look for. Tichborne. This rings well; But by what present mean prepared doth hers Confirm your counsel? or what way set forth So to prevent our enemies with good speed That at the goal we find them not, and there Fall as men broken? Babington. Nay, what think you, man, Or what esteem of her, that hope should lack Herein her counsel? hath she not been found Most wary still, clear-spirited, bright of wit, Keen as a sword's edge, as a bird's eye swift, Man-hearted ever? First, for crown and base Of all this enterprise, she bids me here Examine with good heed of good event What power of horse and foot among us all We may well muster, and in every shire Choose out what captain for them, if we lack For the main host a general;—as indeed Myself being bound to bring her out of bonds Or here with you cut off the heretic queen Could take not this on me;—what havens, towns, What ports to north and west and south, may we Assure ourselves to hold in certain hand For entrance and receipt of help from France, From Spain, or the Low Countries; in what place Draw our main head together; for how long Raise for this threefold force of foreign friends Wage and munition, or what harbours choose For these to land; or what provision crave Of coin at need or armour; by what means The six her friends deliberate to proceed; And last the manner how to get her forth From this last hold wherein she newly lies: These heads hath she set down, and bids me take Of all seven points counsel and common care With as few friends as may be of the chief Ranged on our part for actors; and thereon Of all devised with diligent speed despatch Word to the ambassador of Spain in France, Who to the experience past of all the estate Here on this side aforetime that he hath Shall join goodwill to serve us. Tilney. Ay, no more? Of us no more I mean, who being most near To the English queen our natural mistress born Take on our hands, her household pensioners', The stain and chiefest peril of her blood Shed by close violence under trust; no word, No care shown further of our enterprise That flowers to fruit for her sake? Babington. Fear not that; Abide till we draw thither—ay—she bids Get first assurance of such help to come, And take thereafter, what before were vain, Swift order to provide arms, horses, coin, Wherewith to march at word from every shire Given by the chief; and save these principals Let no man's knowledge less in place partake The privy ground we move on, but set forth For entertainment of the meaner ear We do but fortify us against the plot Laid of the Puritan part in all this realm That have their general force now drawn to head In the Low Countries, whence being home returned They think to spoil us utterly, and usurp Not from her only and all else lawful heirs The kingly power, but from their queen that is (As we may let the bruit fly forth disguised) Wrest that which now she hath, if she for fear Take not their yoke upon her, and therefrom Catch like infection from plague-tainted air The purulence of their purity; with which plea We so may stablish our confederacies As wrought but for defence of lands, lives, goods, From them that would cut off our faith and these; No word writ straight or given directly forth Against the queen, but rather showing our will Firm to maintain her and her lineal heirs, Myself (she saith) not named. Ha, gallant souls, Hath our queen's craft no savour of sweet wit, No brain to help her heart with? Tichborne. But our end— No word of this yet? Babington. And a good word, here, And worth our note, good friend; being thus prepared, Time then shall be to set our hands on work And straight thereon take order that she may Be suddenly transported out of guard, Not tarrying till our foreign force come in, Which then must make the hotter haste; and seeing We can make no day sure for our design Nor certain hour appointed when she might Find other friends at hand on spur of the act To take her forth of prison, ye should have About you always, or in court at least, Scouts furnished well with horses of good speed To bear the tiding to her and them whose charge Shall be to bring her out of bonds, that these May be about her ere her keeper have word What deed is freshly done; in any case, Ere he can make him strong within the house Or bear her forth of it: and need it were By divers ways to send forth two or three That one may pass if one be stayed; nor this Should we forget, to assay in the hour of need To cut the common posts off; by this plot May we steer safe, and fall not miserably, As they that laboured heretofore herein, Through overhaste to stir upon this side Ere surety make us strong of strangers' aid. And if at first we bring her forth of bonds, Be well assured, she bids us—as I think She doubts not me that I should let this slip, Forget so main a matter—well assured To set her in the heart of some strong host, Or strength of some good hold, where she may stay Till we be mustered and the ally drawn in; For should the queen, being scatheless of us yet As we unready, fall upon her flight, The bird untimely fled from snare to snare Should find being caught again a narrower hold Whence she should fly forth never, if cause indeed Should seem not given to use her worse; and we Should be with all extremity pursued, To her more grief; for this should grieve her more Than what might heaviest fall upon her. Tilney. Ay? She hath had then work enough to do to weep For them that bled before; Northumberland, The choice of all the north spoiled, banished, slain, Norfolk that should have ringed the fourth sad time The fairest hand wherewith fate ever led So many a man to deathward, or sealed up So many an eye from sunlight. Babington. By my head, Which is the main stake of this cast, I swear There is none worth more than a tear of hers That man wears living or that man might lose, Borne upright in the sun, or for her sake Bowed down by theirs she weeps for: nay, but hear; She bids me take most vigilant heed, that all May prosperously find end assured, and you Conclude with me in judgment; to myself As chief of trust in my particular Refers you for assurance, and commends To counsel seasonable and time's advice Your common resolution; and again, If the design take yet not hold, as chance For all our will may turn it, we should not Pursue her transport nor the plot laid else Of our so baffled enterprise; but say When this were done we might not come at her Being by mishap close guarded in the Tower Or some strength else as dangerous, yet, she saith, For God's sake leave not to proceed herein To the utmost undertaking; for herself At any time shall most contentedly Die, knowing of our deliverance from the bonds Wherein as slaves we are holden. Barnwell. So shall I, Knowing at the least of her enfranchisement Whose life were worth the whole blood shed o'the world And all men's hearts made empty. Babington. Ay, good friend, Here speaks she of your fellows, that some stir Might be in Ireland laboured to begin Some time ere we take aught on us, that thence The alarm might spring right on the part opposed To where should grow the danger: she meantime Should while the work were even in hand assay To make the Catholics in her Scotland rise And put her son into their hands, that so No help may serve our enemies thence; again, That from our plots the stroke may come, she thinks To have some chief or general head of all Were now most apt for the instant end; wherein I branch not off from her in counsel, yet Conceive not how to send the appointed word To the earl of Arundel now fast in bonds Held in the Tower she spake of late, who now Would have us give him careful note of this, Him or his brethren; and from oversea Would have us seek, if he be there at large, To the young son of dead Northumberland, And Westmoreland, whose hand and name, we know, May do much northward; ay, but this we know, How much his hand was lesser than his name When proof was put on either; and the lord Paget, whose power is in some shires of weight To incline them usward; both may now be had, And some, she saith, of the exiles principal, If the enterprise be resolute once, with these May come back darkling; Paget lies in Spain, Whom we may treat with by his brother's mean, Charles, who keeps watch in Paris: then in the end She bids beware no messenger sent forth That bears our counsel bear our letters; these Must through blind hands precede them or ensue By ignorant posts and severally despatched; And of her sweet wise heart, as we were fools, —But that I think she fears not—bids take heed Of spies among us and false brethren, chief Of priests already practised on, she saith, By the enemy's craft against us; what, forsooth, We have not eyes to set such knaves apart And look their wiles through, but should need misdoubt —Whom shall I say the least on all our side?— Good Gilbert Gifford with his kind boy's face That fear's lean self could fear not? but God knows Woman is wise, but woman; none so bold, So cunning none, God help the soft sweet wit, But the fair flesh with weakness taints it; why, She warns me here of perilous scrolls to keep That I should never bear about me, seeing By that fault sank all they that fell before Who should have walked unwounded else of proof, Unstayed of justice: but this following word Hath savour of more judgment; we should let As little as we may our names be known Or purpose here to the envoy sent from France, Whom though she hears for honest, we must fear His master holds the course of his design Far contrary to this of ours, which known Might move him to discovery. Tichborne. Well forewarned: Forearmed enough were now that cause at need Which had but half so good an armour on To fight false faith or France in. Babington. Peace awhile; Here she winds up her craft. She hath long time sued To shift her lodging, and for answer hath None but the Castle of Dudley named as meet To serve this turn; and thither may depart, She thinks, with parting summer; whence may we Devise what means about those lands to lay For her deliverance; who from present bonds May but by one of three ways be discharged: When she shall ride forth on the moors that part Her prison-place from Stafford, where few folk Use to pass over, on the same day set, With fifty or threescore men well horsed and armed, To take her from her keeper's charge, who rides With but some score that bear but pistols; next, To come by deep night round the darkling house And fire the barns and stables, which being nigh Shall draw the household huddling forth to help, And they that come to serve her, wearing each A secret sign for note and cognizance, May some of them surprise the house, whom she Shall with her servants meet and second; last, When carts come in at morning, these being met In the main gateway's midst may by device Fall or be sidelong overthrown, and we Make in thereon and suddenly possess The house whence lightly might we bear her forth Ere help came in of soldiers to relief Who lie a mile or half a mile away In several lodgings: but howe'er this end She holds her bounden to me all her days Who proffer me to hazard for her love, And doubtless shall as well esteem of you Or scarce less honourably, when she shall know Your names who serve beneath me; so commends Her friend to God, and bids me burn the word That I would wear at heart for ever; yet, Lest this sweet scripture haply write us dead, Where she set hand I set my lips, and thus Rend mine own heart with her sweet name, and end. [Tears the letter. Salisbury. She hath chosen a trusty servant. Babington. Ay, of me? What ails you at her choice? was this not I That laid the ground of all this work, and wrought Your hearts to shape for service? or perchance The man was you that took this first on him, To serve her dying and living, and put on The bloodred name of traitor and the deed Found for her sake not murderous? Salisbury. Why, they say First Gifford put this on you, Ballard next, Whom he brought over to redeem your heart Half lost for doubt already, and refresh The flagging flame that fired it first, and now Fell faltering half in ashes, whence his breath Hardly with hard pains quickened it and blew The grey to red rekindling. Babington. Sir, they lie Who say for fear I faltered, or lost heart For doubt to lose life after; let such know It shames me not though I were slow of will To take such work upon my soul and hand As killing of a queen; being once assured, Brought once past question, set beyond men's doubts By witness of God's will borne sensibly, Meseems I have swerved not. Salisbury. Ay, when once the word Was washed in holy water, you would wear Lightly the name so hallowed of priests' lips That men spell murderer; but till Ballard spake The shadow of her slaying whom we shall strike Was ice to freeze your purpose. Tichborne. Friend, what then? Is this so small a thing, being English born, To strike the living empire here at heart That is called England? stab her present state, Give even her false-faced likeness up to death, With hands that smite a woman? I that speak, Ye know me if now my faith be firm, and will To do faith's bidding; yet it wrings not me To say I was not quick nor light of heart, Though moved perforce of will unwillingly, To take in trust this charge upon me. Barnwell. I With all good will would take, and give God thanks, The charge of all that falter in it: by heaven, To hear in the end of doubts and doublings heaves My heart up as with sickness. Why, by this The heretic harlot that confounds our hope Should be made carrion, with those following four That were to wait upon her dead: all five Live yet to scourge God's servants, and we prate And threaten here in painting: by my life, I see no more in us of life or heart Than in this heartless picture. Babington. Peace again; Our purpose shall not long lack life, nor they Whose life is deadly to the heart of ours Much longer keep it; Burghley, Walsingham, Hunsdon and Knowles, all these four names writ out, With hers at head they worship, are but now As those five several letters that spell death In eyes that read them right. Give me but faith A little longer: trust that heart awhile Which laid the ground of all our glories; think I that was chosen of our queen's friends in France, By Morgan's hand there prisoner for her sake On charge of such a deed's device as ours Commended to her for trustiest, and a man More sure than might be Ballard and more fit To bear the burden of her counsels—I Can be not undeserving, whom she trusts, That ye should likewise trust me; seeing at first She writes me but a thankful word, and this, God wot, for little service; I return For aptest answer and thankworthiest meed Word of the usurper's plotted end, and she With such large heart of trust and liberal faith As here ye have heard requites me: whom, I think, For you to trust is no too great thing now For me to ask and have of all. Tichborne. Dear friend, Mistrust has no part in our mind of you More than in hers; yet she too bids take heed, As I would bid you take, and let not slip The least of her good counsels, which to keep No whit proclaims us colder than herself Who gives us charge to keep them; and to slight No whit proclaims us less unserviceable Who are found too hot to serve her than the slave Who for cold heart and fear might fail. Babington. Too hot! Why, what man's heart hath heat enough or blood To give for such good service? Look you, sirs, This is no new thing for my faith to keep, My soul to feed its fires with, and my hope Fix eyes upon for star to steer by; she That six years hence the boy that I was then, And page, ye know, to Shrewsbury, gave his faith To serve and worship with his body and soul For only lady and queen, with power alone To lift my heart up and bow down mine eyes At sight and sense of her sweet sovereignty, Made thence her man for ever; she whose look Turned all my blood of life to tears and fire, That going or coming, sad or glad—for yet She would be somewhile merry, as though to give Comfort, and ease at heart her servants, then Weep smilingly to be so light of mind, Saying she was like the bird grown blithe in bonds That if too late set free would die for fear, Or wild birds hunt it out of life—if sad, Put madness in me for her suffering's sake, If joyous, for her very love's sake—still Made my heart mad alike to serve her, being I know not when the sweeter, sad or blithe, Nor what mood heavenliest of her, all whose change Was as of stars and sun and moon in heaven; She is well content,—ye have heard her—she, to die, If we without her may redeem ourselves And loose our lives from bondage; but her friends Must take forsooth good heed they be not, no, Too hot of heart to serve her! And for me, Am I so vain a thing of wind and smoke That your deep counsel must have care to keep My lightness safe in wardship? I sought none— Craved no man's counsel to draw plain my plot, Need no man's warning to dispose my deed. Have I not laid of mine own hand a snare To bring no less a lusty bird to lure Than Walsingham with proffer of myself For scout and spy on mine own friends in France To fill his wise wide ears with large report Of all things wrought there on our side, and plots Laid for our queen's sake? and for all his wit This politic knave misdoubts me not, whom ye Hold yet too light and lean of wit to pass Unspied of wise men on our enemies' part, Who have sealed the subtlest eyes up of them all. Tichborne. That would I know; for if they be not blind, But only wink upon your proffer, seeing More than they let your own eyes find or fear, Why, there may lurk a fire to burn us all Masked in them with false blindness. Babington. Hear you, sirs? Now by the faith I had in this my friend And by mine own yet flawless toward him, yea By all true love and trust that holds men fast, It shames me that I held him in this cause Half mine own heart, my better hand and eye, Mine other soul and worthier. Pray you, go; Let us not hold you; sir, be quit of us; Go home, lie safe, and give God thanks; lie close, Keep your head warm and covered; nay, be wise; We are fit for no such wise folk's fellowship, No married man's who being bid forth to fight Holds his wife's kirtle fitter wear for man Than theirs who put on iron: I did know it, Albeit I would not know; this man that was, This soul and sinew of a noble seed, Love and the lips that burn a bridegroom's through Have charmed to deathward, and in steel's good stead Left him a silken spirit. Tichborne. By that faith Which yet I think you have found as fast in me As ever yours I found, you wrong me more Than were I that your words can make me not I had wronged myself and all our cause; I hold No whit less dear for love's sake even than love Faith, honour, friendship, all that all my days Was only dear to my desire, till now This new thing dear as all these only were Made all these dearer. If my love be less Toward you, toward honour or this cause, then think I love my wife not either, whom you know How close at heart I cherish, but in all Play false alike. Lead now which way you will, And wear what likeness; though to all men else It look not smooth, smooth shall it seem to me, And danger be not dangerous; where you go, For me shall wildest ways be safe, and straight For me the steepest; with your eyes and heart Will I take count of life and death, and think No thought against your counsel: yea, by heaven, I had rather follow and trust my friend and die Than halt and hark mistrustfully behind To live of him mistrusted. Babington. Why, well said: Strike hands upon it; I think you shall not find A trustless pilot of me. Keep we fast, And hold you fast my counsel, we shall see The state high-builded here of heretic hope Shaken to dust and death. Here comes more proof To warrant me no liar. You are welcome, sirs; Enter Ballard, disguised, and Savage. Good father captain, come you plumed or cowled, Or stoled or sworded, here at any hand The true heart bids you welcome. Ballard. Sir, at none Is folly welcome to mine ears or eyes. Nay, stare not on me stormily; I say, I bid at no hand welcome, by no name, Be it ne'er so wise or valiant on men's lips, Pledge health to folly, nor forecast good hope For them that serve her, I, but take of men Things ill done ill at any hand alike. Ye shall not say I cheered you to your death, Nor would, though nought more dangerous than your death Or deadlier for our cause and God's in ours Were here to stand the chance of, and your blood Shed vainly with no seed for faith to sow Should be not poison for men's hopes to drink. What is this picture? Have ye sense or souls, Eyes, ears, or wits to take assurance in Of how ye stand in strange men's eyes and ears, How fare upon their talking tongues, how dwell In shot of their suspicion, and sustain How great a work how lightly? Think ye not These men have ears and eyes about your ways, Walk with your feet, work with your hands, and watch When ye sleep sound and babble in your sleep? What knave was he, or whose man sworn and spy, That drank with you last night? whose hireling lip Was this that pledged you, Master Babington, To a foul quean's downfall and a fair queen's rise? Can ye not seal your tongues from tavern speech, Nor sup abroad but air may catch it back, Nor think who set that watch upon your lips Yourselves can keep not on them? Babington. What, my friends! Here is one come to counsel, God be thanked, That bears commission to rebuke us all. Why, hark you, sir, you that speak judgment, you That take our doom upon your double tongue To sentence and accuse us with one breath, Our doomsman and our justicer for sin, Good Captain Ballard, Father Fortescue, Who made you guardian of us poor men, gave Your wisdom wardship of our follies, chose Your faith for keeper of our faiths, that yet Were never taxed of change or doubted? You, 'Tis you that have an eye to us, and take note What time we keep, what place, what company, How far may wisdom trust us to be wise Or faith esteem us faithful, and yourself Were once the hireling hand and tongue and eye That waited on this very Walsingham To spy men's counsels and betray their blood Whose trust had sealed you trusty? By God's light, A goodly guard I have of you, to crave What man was he I drank with yesternight, What name, what shape, what habit, as, forsooth, Were I some statesman's knave and spotted spy, The man I served, and cared not how, being dead, His molten gold should glut my throat in hell, Might question of me whom I snared last night, Make inquisition of his face, his gait, His speech, his likeness. Well, be answered then; By God, I know not; but God knows I think The spy most dangerous on my secret walks And witness of my ways most worth my fear And deadliest listener to devour my speech Now questions me of danger, and the tongue Most like to sting my trust and life to death Now taxes mine of rashness. Ballard. Is he mad? Or are ye brainsick all with heat of wine That stand and hear him rage like men in storms Made drunk with danger? have ye sworn with him To die the fool's death too of furious fear And passion scared to slaughter of itself? Is there none here that knows his cause or me, Nor what should save or spoil us? Tichborne. Friend, give ear; For God's sake, yet be counselled. Babington. Ay, for God's! What part hath God in this man's counsels? nay, Take you part with him; nay, in God's name go; What should you do to bide with me? turn back; There stands your captain. Savage. Hath not one man here One spark in spirit or sprinkling left of shame? I that looked once for no such fellowship, But soldier's hearts in shapes of gentlemen, I am sick with shame to hear men's jangling tongues Outnoise their swords unbloodied. Hear me, sirs; My hand keeps time before my tongue, and hath But wit to speak in iron; yet as now Such wit were sharp enough to serve our turn That keenest tongues may serve not. One thing sworn Calls on our hearts; the queen must singly die, Or we, half dead men now with dallying, must Die several deaths for her brief one, and stretched Beyond the scope of sufferance; wherefore here Choose out the man to put this peril on And gird him with this glory; let him pass Straight hence to court, and through all stays of state Strike death into her heart. Babington. Why, this rings right; Well said, and soldierlike; do thus, and take The vanguard of us all for honour. Savage. Ay, Well would I go, but seeing no courtly suit Like yours, her servants and her pensioners, The doorkeepers will bid my baseness back From passage to her presence. Babington. O, for that, Take this and buy; nay, start not from your word; You shall not. Savage. Sir, I shall not. Babington. Here's more gold; Make haste, and God go with you; if the plot Be blown on once of men's suspicious breath, We are dead, and all die bootless deaths—be swift— And her we have served we shall but surely slay. I will make trial again of Walsingham If he misdoubt us. O, my cloak and sword— [Knocking within. I will go forth myself. What noise is that? Get you to Gage's lodging; stay not here; Make speed without for Westminster; perchance There may we safely shift our shapes and fly, If the end be come upon us. Ballard. It is here. Death knocks at door already. Fly; farewell. Babington. I would not leave you—but they know you not— You need not fear, being found here singly. Ballard. No. Babington. Nay, halt not, sirs; no word but haste; this way, Ere they break down the doors. God speed us well! [Exeunt all but Ballard. As they go out enter an Officer with Soldiers. Officer. Here's one fox yet by the foot; lay hold on him. Ballard. What would you, sirs? Officer. Why, make one foul bird fast, Though the full flight be scattered: for their kind Must prey not here again, nor here put on The jay's loose feathers for the raven priest's To mock the blear-eyed marksman: these plucked off Shall show the nest that sent this fledgeling forth, Hatched in the hottest holy nook of hell. Ballard. I am a soldier. Officer. Ay, the badge we know Whose broidery signs the shoulders of the file That Satan marks for Jesus. Bind him fast: Blue satin and slashed velvet and gold lace, Methinks we have you, and the hat's band here So seemly set with silver buttons, all As here was down in order; by my faith, A goodly ghostly friend to shrive a maid As ever kissed for penance: pity 'tis The hangman's hands must hallow him again When this lay slough slips off, and twist one rope For priest to swing with soldier. Bring him hence. [Exeunt. Scene II. Chartley. Mary Stuart and Mary Beaton. Mary Stuart. We shall not need keep house for fear to-day; The skies are fair and hot; the wind sits well For hound and horn to chime with. I will go. Mary Beaton. How far from this to Tixall? Mary Stuart. Nine or ten Or what miles more I care not; we shall find Fair field and goodly quarry, or he lies, The gospeller that bade us to the sport, Protesting yesternight the shire had none To shame Sir Walter Aston's. God be praised, I take such pleasure yet to back my steed And bear my crossbow for a deer's death well, I am almost half content—and yet I lie— To ride no harder nor more dangerous heat And hunt no beast of game less gallant. Mary Beaton. Nay, You grew long since more patient. Mary Stuart. Ah, God help! What should I do but learn the word of him These years and years, the last word learnt but one, That ever I loved least of all sad words? The last is death for any soul to learn, The last save death is patience. Mary Beaton. Time enough We have had ere death of life to learn it in Since you rode last on wilder ways than theirs That drive the dun deer to his death. Mary Stuart. Eighteen— How many more years yet shall God mete out For thee and me to wait upon their will And hope or hope not, watch or sleep, and dream Awake or sleeping? surely fewer, I think, Than half these years that all have less of life Than one of those more fleet that flew before. I am yet some ten years younger than this queen, Some nine or ten; but if I die this year And she some score years longer than I think Be royal-titled, in one year of mine I shall have lived the longer life, and die The fuller-fortuned woman. Dost thou mind The letter that I writ nigh two years gone To let her wit what privacies of hers Our trusty dame of Shrewsbury's tongue made mine Ere it took fire to sting her lord and me? How thick soe'er o'erscurfed with poisonous lies, Of her I am sure it lied not; and perchance I did the wiselier, having writ my fill, Yet to withhold the letter when she sought Of me to know what villainies had it poured In ears of mine against her innocent name: And yet thou knowest what mirthful heart was mine To write her word of these, that had she read Had surely, being but woman, made her mad, Or haply, being not woman, had not. 'Faith, How say'st thou? did I well? Mary Beaton. Ay, surely well To keep that back you did not ill to write. Mary Stuart. I think so, and again I think not; yet The best I did was bid thee burn it. She, That other Bess I mean of Hardwick, hath Mixed with her gall the fire at heart of hell, And all the mortal medicines of the world To drug her speech with poison; and God wot Her daughter's child here that I bred and loved, Bess Pierpoint, my sweet bedfellow that was, Keeps too much savour of her grandam's stock For me to match with Nau; my secretary Shall with no slip of hers engraft his own, Begetting shame or peril to us all From her false blood and fiery tongue; except I find a mate as meet to match with him For truth to me as Gilbert Curle hath found, I will play Tudor once and break the banns, Put on the feature of Elizabeth To frown their hands in sunder. Mary Beaton. Were it not Some tyranny to take her likeness on And bitter-hearted grudge of matrimony For one and not his brother secretary, Forbid your Frenchman's banns for jealousy And grace your English with such liberal love As Barbara fails not yet to find of you Since she writ Curle for Mowbray? and herein There shows no touch of Tudor in your mood More than its wont is; which indeed is nought; The world, they say, for her should waste, ere man Should get her virginal goodwill to wed. Mary Stuart. I would not be so tempered of my blood, So much mismade as she in spirit and flesh, To be more fair of fortune. She should hate Not me, albeit she hate me deadly, more Than thee or any woman. By my faith, Fain would I know, what knowing not of her now I muse upon and marvel, if she have Desire or pulse or passion of true heart Fed full from natural veins, or be indeed All bare and barren all as dead men's bones Of all sweet nature and sharp seed of love, And those salt springs of life, through fire and tears That bring forth pain and pleasure in their kind To make good days and evil, all in her Lie sere and sapless as the dust of death. I have found no great good hap in all my days Nor much good cause to make me glad of God, Yet have I had and lacked not of my life My good things and mine evil: being not yet Barred from life's natural ends of evil and good Foredoomed for man and woman through the world Till all their works be nothing: and of mine I know but this—though I should die to-day, I would not take for mine her fortune. Mary Beaton. No? Myself perchance I would not. Mary Stuart. Dost thou think That fire-tongued witch of Shrewsbury spake once truth Who told me all those quaint foul merry tales Of our dear sister that at her desire I writ to give her word of, and at thine Withheld and put the letter in thine hand To burn as was thy counsel? for my part, How loud she lied soever in the charge That for adultery taxed me with her lord And being disproved before the council here Brought on their knees to give themselves the lie Her and her sons by that first lord of four That took in turn this hell-mouthed hag to wife And got her kind upon her, yet in this I do believe she lied not more than I Reporting her by record, how she said What infinite times had Leicester and his queen Plucked all the fruitless fruit of baffled love That being contracted privily they might, With what large gust of fierce and foiled desire This votaress crowned, whose vow could no man break, Since God whose hand shuts up the unkindly womb Had sealed it on her body, man by man Would course her kindless lovers, and in quest Pursue them hungering as a hound in heat, Full on the fiery scent and slot of lust, That men took shame and laughed and marvelled; one, Her chamberlain, so hotly would she trace And turn perforce from cover, that himself Being tracked at sight thus in the general eye Was even constrained to play the piteous hare And wind and double till her amorous chase Were blind with speed and breathless; but the worst Was this, that for this country's sake and shame's Our huntress Dian could not be content With Hatton and another born her man And subject of this kingdom, but to heap The heavier scandal on her countrymen Had cast the wild growth of her lust away On one base-born, a stranger, whom of nights Within her woman's chamber would she seek To kiss and play for shame with secretly; And with the duke her bridegroom that should be, That should and could not, seeing forsooth no man Might make her wife or woman, had she dealt As with this knave his follower; for by night She met him coming at her chamber door In her bare smock and night-rail, and thereon Bade him come in; who there abode three hours: But fools were they that thought to bind her will And stay with one man or allay the mood That ranging still gave tongue on several heats To hunt fresh trails of lusty love; all this, Thou knowest, on record truly was set down, With much more villainous else: she prayed me write That she might know the natural spirit and mind Toward her of this fell witch whose rancorous mouth Then bayed my name, as now being great with child By her fourth husband, in whose charge I lay As here in Paulet's; so being moved I wrote, And yet I would she had read it, though not now Would I re-write each word again, albeit I might, or thou, were I so minded, or Thyself so moved to bear such witness; but 'Tis well we know not how she had borne to read All this and more, what counsel gave the dame, With loud excess of laughter urging me To enter on those lists of love-making My son for suitor to her, who thereby Might greatly serve and stead me in her sight; And I replying that such a thing could be But held a very mockery, she returns, The queen was so infatuate and distraught With high conceit of her fair fretted face As of a heavenly goddess, that herself Would take it on her head with no great pains To bring her to believe it easily; Being so past reason fain of flattering tongues She thought they mocked her not nor lied who said They might not sometimes look her full in face For the light glittering from it as the sun; And so perforce must all her women say And she herself that spake, who durst not look For fear to laugh out each in other's face Even while they fooled and fed her vein with words, Nor let their eyes cross when they spake to her And set their feature fast as in a frame To keep grave countenance with gross mockery lined; And how she prayed me chide her daughter, whom She might by no means move to take this way, And for her daughter Talbot was assured She could not ever choose but laugh outright Even in the good queen's flattered face. God wot, Had she read all, and in my hand set down, I could not blame her though she had sought to take My head for payment; no less poise on earth Had served, and hardly, for the writer's fee; I could not much have blamed her; all the less, That I did take this, though from slanderous lips, For gospel and not slander, and that now I yet do well believe it. Mary Beaton. And herself Had well believed so much, and surely seen, For all your protest of discredit made With God to witness that you could not take Such tales for truth of her nor would not, yet You meant not she should take your word for this, As well I think she would not. Mary Stuart. Haply, no. We do protest not thus to be believed. And yet the witch in one thing seven years since Belied her, saying she then must needs die soon For timeless fault of nature. Now belike The soothsaying that speaks short her span to be May prove more true of presage. Mary Beaton. Have you hope The chase to-day may serve our further ends Than to renew your spirit and bid time speed? Mary Stuart. I see not but I may; the hour is full Which I was bidden expect of them to bear More fruit than grows of promise; Babington Should tarry now not long; from France our friends Lift up their heads to usward, and await What comfort may confirm them from our part Who sent us comfort; Ballard's secret tongue Has kindled England, striking from men's hearts As from a flint the fire that slept, and made Their dark dumb thoughts and dim disfigured hopes Take form from his and feature, aim and strength, Speech and desire toward action; all the shires Wherein the force lies hidden of our faith Are stirred and set on edge of present deed And hope more imminent now of help to come And work to do than ever; not this time We hang on trust in succour that comes short By Philip's fault from Austrian John, whose death Put widow's weeds on mine unwedded hope, Late trothplight to his enterprise in vain That was to set me free, but might not seal The faith it pledged nor on the hand of hope Make fast the ring that weds desire with deed And promise with performance; Parma stands More fast now for us in his uncle's stead, Albeit the lesser warrior, yet in place More like to avail us, and in happier time To do like service; for my cousin of Guise, His hand and league hold fast our kinsman king, If not to bend and shape him for our use, Yet so to govern as he may not thwart Our forward undertaking till its force Discharge itself on England: from no side I see the shade of any fear to fail As those before so baffled; heart and hand Our hope is armed with trust more strong than steel And spirit to strike more helpful than a sword In hands that lack the spirit; and here to-day It may be I shall look this hope in the eyes And see her face transfigured. God is good; He will not fail his faith for ever. O, That I were now in saddle! Yet an hour, And I shall be as young again as May Whose life was come to August; like this year, I had grown past midway of my life, and sat Heartsick of summer; but new-mounted now I shall ride right through shine and shade of spring With heart and habit of a bride, and bear A brow more bright than fortune. Truth it is, Those words of bride and May should on my tongue Sound now not merry, ring no joy-bells out In ears of hope or memory; not for me Have they been joyous words; but this fair day All sounds that ring delight in fortunate ears And words that make men thankful, even to me Seem thankworthy for joy they have given me not And hope which now they should not. Mary Beaton. Nay, who knows? The less they have given of joy, the more they may; And they who have had their happiness before Have hope not in the future; time o'erpast And time to be have several ends, nor wear One forward face and backward. Mary Stuart. God, I pray, Turn thy good words to gospel, and make truth Of their kind presage! but our Scotswomen Would say, to be so joyous as I am, Though I had cause, as surely cause I have, Were no good warrant of good hope for me. I never took such comfort of my trust In Norfolk or Northumberland, nor looked For such good end as now of all my fears From all devices past of policy To join my name with my misnatured son's In handfast pledge with England's, ere my foes His counsellors had flawed his craven faith And moved my natural blood to cast me off Who bore him in my body, to come forth Less childlike than a changeling. But not long Shall they find means by him to work their will, Nor he bear head against me; hope was his To reign forsooth without my fellowship, And he that with me would not shall not now Without or with me wield not or divide Or part or all of empire. Mary Beaton. Dear my queen, Vex not your mood with sudden change of thoughts; Your mind but now was merrier than the sun Half rid by this through morning: we by noon Should blithely mount and meet him. Mary Stuart. So I said. My spirit is fallen again from that glad strength Which even but now arrayed it; yet what cause Should dull the dancing measure in my blood For doubt or wrath, I know not. Being once forth, My heart again will quicken. [Sings. And ye maun braid your yellow hair And busk ye like a bride; Wi' sevenscore men to bring ye hame, And ae true love beside; Between the birk and the green rowan Fu' blithely shall ye ride. O ye maun braid my yellow hair, But braid it like nae bride; And I maun gang my ways, mither, Wi' nae true love beside; Between the kirk and the kirkyard Fu' sadly shall I ride. How long since, How long since was it last I heard or sang Such light lost ends of old faint rhyme worn thin With use of country songsters? When we twain Were maidens but some twice a span's length high, Thou hadst the happier memory to hold rhyme, But not for songs the merrier. Mary Beaton. This was one That I would sing after my nurse, I think, And weep upon in France at six years old To think of Scotland. Mary Stuart. Would I weep for that, Woman or child, I have had now years enough To weep in; thou wast never French in heart, Serving the queen of France. Poor queen that was, Poor boy that played her bridegroom! now they seem In these mine eyes that were her eyes as far Beyond the reach and range of oldworld time As their first fathers' graves. Enter Sir Amyas Paulet. Paulet. Madam, if now It please you to set forth, the hour is full, And there your horses ready. Mary Stuart. Sir, my thanks. We are bounden to you and this goodly day For no small comfort. Is it your will we ride Accompanied with any for the nonce Of our own household? Paulet. If you will, to-day Your secretaries have leave to ride with you. Mary Stuart. We keep some state then yet. I pray you, sir, Doth he wait on you that came here last month, A low-built lank-cheeked Judas-bearded man, Lean, supple, grave, pock-pitten, yellow-polled, A smiling fellow with a downcast eye? Paulet. Madam, I know the man for none of mine. Mary Stuart. I give you joy as you should give God thanks, Sir, if I err not; but meseemed this man Found gracious entertainment here, and took Such counsel with you as I surely thought Spake him your friend, and honourable; but now If I misread not an ambiguous word It seems you know no more of him or less Than Peter did, being questioned, of his Lord. Paulet. I know not where the cause were to be sought That might for likeness or unlikeness found Make seemly way for such comparison As turns such names to jest and bitterness; Howbeit, as I denied not nor disclaimed To know the man you speak of, yet I may With very purity of truth profess The man to be not of my following. Mary Stuart. See How lightly may the tongue that thinks no ill Or trip or slip, discoursing that or this With grave good men in purity and truth, And come to shame even with a word! God wot, We had need put bit and bridle in our lips Ere they take on them of their foolishness To change wise words with wisdom. Come, sweet friend, Let us go seek our kind with horse and hound To keep us witless company; belike, There shall we find our fellows. [Exeunt Mary Stuart and Mary Beaton. Paulet. Would to God This day had done its office! mine till then Holds me the verier prisoner. Enter Phillipps. Phillipps. She will go? Paulet. Gladly, poor sinful fool; more gladly, sir, Than I go with her. Phillipps. Yet you go not far; She is come too near her end of wayfaring To tire much more men's feet that follow. Paulet. Ay. She walks but half blind yet to the end; even now She spake of you, and questioned doubtfully What here you came to do, or held what place Or commerce with me: when you caught her eye, It seems your courtesy by some graceless chance Found but scant grace with her. Phillipps. 'Tis mine own blame, Or fault of mine own feature; yet forsooth I greatly covet not their gracious hap Who have found or find most grace with her. I pray, Doth Wade go with you? Paulet. Nay,—what, know you not?— But with Sir Thomas Gorges, from the court, To drive this deer at Tixall. Phillipps. Two years since, He went, I think, commissioned from the queen To treat with her at Sheffield? Paulet. Ay, and since She hath not seen him; who being known of here Had haply given her swift suspicion edge Or cause at least of wonder. Phillipps. And I doubt His last year's entertainment oversea As our queen's envoy to demand of France Her traitor Morgan's body, whence he brought Nought save dry blows back from the duke d'Aumale And for that prisoner's quarters here to hang His own not whole but beaten, should not much Incline him to more good regard of her For whose love's sake her friends have dealt with him So honourably, nor she that knows of this Be the less like to take his presence here For no good presage to her: you have both done well To keep his hand as close herein as mine. Paulet. Sir, by my faith I know not, for myself, What part is for mine honour, or wherein Of all this action laid upon mine hand The name and witness of a gentleman May gain desert or credit, and increase In seed and harvest of good men's esteem For heritage to his heirs, that men unborn Whose fame is as their name derived from his May reap in reputation; and indeed I look for none advancement in the world Further than this that yet for no man's sake Would I forego, to keep the name I have And honour, which no son of mine shall say I have left him not for any deed of mine As perfect as my sire bequeathed it me: I say, for any word or work yet past No tongue can thus far tax me of decline From that fair forthright way of gentleman, Nor shall for any that I think to do Or aught I think to say alive: howbeit, I were much bounden to the man would say But so much for me in our mistress' ear, The treasurer's, or your master Walsingham's, Whose office here I have undergone thus long And had I leave more gladly would put off Than ever I put on me; being not one That out of love toward England even or God At mightiest men's desire would lightly be For loyalty disloyal, or approved In trustless works a trusty traitor; this He that should tell them of me, to procure The speedier end here of this work imposed, Should bind me to him more heartily than thanks Might answer. Phillipps. Good Sir Amyas, you and I Hold no such office in this dangerous time As men make love to for their own name's sake Or personal lust of honour; but herein I pray you yet take note, and pardon me If I for the instance mix your name with mine, That no man's private honour lies at gage, Nor is the stake set here to play for less Than what is more than all men's names alive, The great life's gage of England; in whose name Lie all our own impledged, as all our lives For her redemption forfeit, if the cause Call once upon us; not this gift or this, Or what best likes us or were gladliest given Or might most honourably be parted with For our more credit on her best behalf, Doth she we serve, this land that made us men, Require of all her children; but demands Of our great duty toward her full deserts Even all we have of honour or of life, Of breath or fame to give her. What were I Or what were you, being mean or nobly born, Yet moulded both of one land's natural womb And fashioned out of England, to deny What gift she crave soever, choose and grudge What grace we list to give or what withhold, Refuse and reckon with her when she bids Yield up forsooth not life but fame to come, A good man's praise or gentleman's repute, Or lineal pride of children, and the light Of loyalty remembered? which of these Were worth our mother's death, or shame that might Fall for one hour on England? She must live And keep in all men's sight her honour fast Though all we die dishonoured; and myself Know not nor seek of men's report to know If what I do to serve her till I die Be honourable or shameful, and its end Good in men's eyes or evil; but for God, I find not why the name or fear of him Herein should make me swerve or start aside Through faint heart's falsehood as a broken bow Snapped in his hand that bent it, ere the shaft Find out his enemies' heart, and I that end Whereto I am sped for service even of him Who put this office on us. Paulet. Truly, sir, I lack the wordy wit to match with yours, Who speak no more than soldier; this I know, I am sick in spirit and heart to have in hand Such work or such device of yours as yet For fear and conscience of what worst may come I dare not well bear through. Phillipps. Why, so last month You writ my master word and me to boot I had set you down a course for many things You durst not put in execution, nor Consign the packet to this lady's hand That was returned from mine, seeing all was well, And you should hold yourself most wretched man If by your mean or order there should spring Suspicion 'twixt the several messengers Whose hands unwitting each of other ply The same close trade for the same golden end, While either holds his mate a faithful fool And all their souls, baseborn or gently bred, Are coined and stamped and minted for our use And current in our service; I thereon To assuage your doubt and fortify your fear Was posted hither, where by craft and pains The web is wound up of our enterprise And in our hands we hold her very heart As fast as all this while we held impawned The faith of Barnes that stood for Gifford here To take what letters for his mistress came From southward through the ambassador of France And bear them to the brewer, your honest man, Who wist no further of his fellowship Than he of Gifford's, being as simple knaves As knavish each in his simplicity, And either serviceable alike, to shift Between my master's hands and yours and mine Her letters writ and answered to and fro; And all these faiths as weathertight and safe As was the box that held those letters close At bottom of the barrel, to give up The charge there sealed and ciphered, and receive A charge as great in peril and in price To yield again, when they drew off the beer That weekly served this lady's household whom We have drained as dry of secrets drugged with death As ever they this vessel, and return To her own lips the dregs she brewed or we For her to drink have tempered. What of this Should seem so strange now to you, or distaste So much the daintier palate of your thoughts, That I should need reiterate you by word The work of us o'erpast, or fill your ear With long foregone recital, that at last Your soul may start not or your sense recoil To know what end we are come to, or what hope We took in hand to cut this peril off By what close mean soe'er and what foul hands Unwashed of treason, which it yet mislikes Your knightly palm to touch or close with, seeing The grime of gold is baser than of blood That barks their filthy fingers? yet with these Must you cross hands and grapple, or let fall The trust you took to treasure. Paulet. Sir, I will, Even till the queen take back that gave it; yet Will not join hands with these, nor take on mine The taint of their contagion; knowing no cause That should confound or couple my good name With theirs more hateful than the reek of hell. You had these knaveries and these knaves in charge, Not I that knew not how to handle them Nor whom to choose for chief of treasons, him That in mine ignorant eye, unused to read The shameful scripture of such faces, bare Graved on his smooth and simple cheek and brow No token of a traitor; yet this boy, This milk-mouthed weanling with his maiden chin, This soft-lipped knave, late suckled as on blood And nursed of poisonous nipples, have you not Found false or feared by this, whom first you found A trustier thief and worthier of his wage Than I, poor man, had wit to find him? I, That trust no changelings of the church of hell, No babes reared priestlike at the paps of Rome, Who have left the old harlot's deadly dugs drawn dry, I lacked the craft to rate this knave of price, Your smock-faced Gifford, at his worth aright, Which now comes short of promise. Phillipps. O, not he; Let not your knighthood for a slippery word So much misdoubt his knaveship; here from France, On hint of our suspicion in his ear Half jestingly recorded, that his hand Were set against us in one politic track With his old yoke-fellows in craft and creed, Betraying not them to us but ourselves to them, My Gilbert writes me with such heat of hand Such piteous protestation of his faith So stuffed and swoln with burly-bellied oaths And God and Christ confound him if he lie And Jesus save him as he speaks mere truth, My gracious godly priestling, that yourself Must sure be moved to take his truth on trust Or stand for him approved an atheist. Paulet. Well, That you find stuff of laughter in such gear And mirth to make out of the godless mouth Of such a twice-turned villain, for my part I take in token of your certain trust, And make therewith mine own assurance sure, To see betimes an end of all such craft As takes the faith forsworn of loud-tongued liars And blasphemies of brothel-breathing knaves To build its hope or break its jest upon; And so commend you to your charge, and take Mine own on me less gladly; for by this She should be girt to ride, as the old saw saith, Out of God's blessing into the warm sun And out of the warm sun into the pit That men have dug before her, as herself Had dug for England else a deeper grave To hide our hope for ever: yet I would This day and all that hang on it were done. [Exeunt. Scene III. Before Tixall Park. Mary Stuart, Mary Beaton, Paulet, Curle, Nau, and Attendants. Mary Stuart. If I should never more back steed alive But now had ridden hither this fair day The last road ever I must ride on earth, Yet would I praise it, saying of all days gone And all roads ridden in sight of stars and sun Since first I sprang to saddle, here at last I had found no joyless end. These ways are smooth, And all this land's face merry; yet I find The ways even therefore not so good to ride, And all the land's face therefore less worth love, Being smoother for a palfrey's maiden pace And merrier than our moors for outlook; nay, I lie to say so; there the wind and sun Make madder mirth by midsummer, and fill With broader breath and lustier length of light The heartier hours that clothe for even and dawn Our bosom-belted billowy-blossoming hills Whose hearts break out in laughter like the sea For miles of heaving heather. Ye should mock My banished praise of Scotland; and in faith I praised it but to prick you on to praise Of your own goodly land; though field and wood Be parked and parcelled to the sky's edge out, And this green Stafford moorland smooth and strait That we but now rode over, and by ours Look pale for lack of large live mountain bloom Wind-buffeted with morning, it should be Worth praise of men whose lineal honour lives In keeping here of history: but meseems I have heard, Sir Amyas, of your liberal west As of a land more affluent-souled than this And fruitful-hearted as the south-wind; here I find a fair-faced change of temperate clime From that bald hill-brow in a broad bare plain Where winter laid us both his prisoners late Fast by the feet at Tutbury; but men say Your birthright in this land is fallen more fair In goodlier ground of heritage: perchance, Grief to be now barred thence by mean of me, Who less than you can help it or myself, Makes you ride sad and sullen. Paulet. Madam, no; I pray you lay not to my wilful charge The blame or burden of discourtesy That but the time should bear which lays on me This weight of thoughts untimely. Mary Stuart. Nay, fair sir, If I, that have no cause in life to seem Glad of my sad life more than prisoners may, Take comfort yet of sunshine, he methinks That holds in ward my days and nights might well Take no less pleasure of this broad blithe air Than his poor charge that too much troubles him. What, are we nigh the chase? Paulet. Even hard at hand. Mary Stuart. Can I not see between the glittering leaves Gleam the dun hides and flash the startled horns That we must charge and scatter? Were I queen And had a crown to wager on my hand, Sir, I would set it on the chance to-day To shoot a flight beyond you. Paulet. Verily, The hazard were too heavy for my skill: I would not hold your wager. Mary Stuart. No! and why? Paulet. For fear to come a bowshot short of you On the left hand, unluckily. Mary Stuart. My friend, Our keeper's wit-shaft is too keen for ours To match its edge with pointless iron.—Sir, Your tongue shoots further than my hand or eye With sense or aim can follow.—Gilbert Curle, Your heart yet halts behind this cry of hounds, Hunting your own deer's trail at home, who lies Now close in covert till her bearing-time Be full to bring forth kindly fruit of kind To love that yet lacks issue; and in sooth I blame you not to bid all sport go by For one white doe's sake travailing, who myself Think long till I may take within mine arm The soft fawn suckling that is yeaned not yet But is to make her mother. We must hold A goodly christening feast with prisoner's cheer And mirth enow for such a tender thing As will not weep more to be born in bonds Than babes born out of gaoler's ward, nor grudge To find no friend more fortunate than I Nor happier hand to welcome it, nor name More prosperous than poor mine to wear, if God Shall send the new-made mother's breast, for love Of us that love his mother's maidenhood, A maid to be my namechild, and in all Save love to them that love her, by God's grace, Most unlike me; for whose unborn sweet sake Pray you meantime be merry.—'Faith, methinks Here be more huntsmen out afield to-day And merrier than my guardian. Sir, look up; What think you of these riders?—All my friends, Make on to meet them. Paulet. There shall need no haste; They ride not slack or lamely. Mary Stuart. Now, fair sir, What say you to my chance on wager? here I think to outshoot your archery.—By my life, That too must fail if hope now fail me; these That ride so far off yet, being come, shall bring Death or deliverance. Prithee, speak but once; [Aside to Mary Beaton. Say, these are they we looked for; say, thou too Hadst hope to meet them; say, they should be here, And I did well to look for them; O God! Say but I was not mad to hope; see there; Speak, or I die. Mary Beaton. Nay, not before they come. Mary Stuart. Dost thou not hear my heart? it speaks so loud I can hear nothing of them. Yet I will not Fail in mine enemy's sight. This is mine hour That was to be for triumph; God, I pray, Stretch not its length out longer! Mary Beaton. It is past. Enter Sir Thomas Gorges, Sir William Wade, and Soldiers. Mary Stuart. What man is this that stands across our way? Gorges. One that hath warrant, madam, from the queen To arrest your French and English secretary And for more surety see yourself removed To present ward at Tixall here hard by, As in this paper stands of her subscribed. Lay hands on them. Mary Stuart. Was this your riddle's word? [To Paulet You have shot beyond me indeed, and shot to death Your honour with my life.—Draw, sirs, and stand; Ye have swords yet left to strike with once, and die By these our foes are girt with. Some good friend— I should have one yet left of you—take heart And slay me here. For God's love, draw; they have not So large a vantage of us we must needs Bear back one foot from peril. Give not way; Ye shall but die more shamefully than here Who can but here die fighting. What, no man? Must I find never at my need alive A man with heart to help me? O, my God, Let me die now and foil them! Paulet, you, Most knightly liar and traitor, was not this Part of your charge, to play my hangman too, Who have played so well my doomsman, and betrayed So honourably my trust, so bravely set A snare so loyal to make sure for death So poor a foolish woman? Sir, or you That have this gallant office, great as his, To do the deadliest errand and most vile That even your mistress ever laid on man And sent her basest knave to bear and slay, You are likewise of her chivalry, and should not Shrink to fulfil your title; being a knight, For her dear sake that made you, lose not heart To strike for her one worthy stroke, that may Rid me defenceless of the loathed long life She gapes for like a bloodhound. Nay, I find A face beside you that should bear for me Not life inscribed upon it; two years since I read therein at Sheffield what good will She bare toward me that sent to treat withal So mean a man and shameless, by his tongue To smite mine honour on the face, and turn My name of queen to servant; by his hand So let her turn my life's name now to death, Which I would take more thankfully than shame To plead and thus prevail not. Paulet. Madam, no, With us you may not in such suit prevail Nor we by words or wrath of yours be moved To turn their edge back on you, nor remit The least part of our office, which deserves Nor scorn of you nor wonder, whose own act Has laid it on us; wherefore with less rage Please you take thought now to submit yourself, Even for your own more honour, to the effect Whose cause was of your own device, that here Bears fruit unlooked for; which being ripe in time You cannot choose but taste of, nor may we But do the season's bidding, and the queen's Who weeps at heart to know it.—Disarm these men; Take you the prisoners to your present ward And hence again to London; here meanwhile Some week or twain their lady must lie close And with a patient or impatient heart Expect an end and word of judgment: I Must with Sir William back to Chartley straight And there make inquisition ere day close What secret serpents of what treasons hatched May in this lady's papers lurk, whence we Must pluck the fangs forth of them yet unfleshed, And lay these plots like dead and strangled snakes Naked before the council. Mary Stuart. I must go? Gorges. Madam, no help; I pray your pardon. Mary Stuart. Ay? Had I your pardon in this hand to give, And here in this my vengeance—Words, and words! God, for thy pity! what vile thing is this That thou didst make of woman? even in death, As in the extremest evil of all our lives, We can but curse or pray, but prate and weep, And all our wrath is wind that works no wreck, And all our fire as water. Noble sirs, We are servants of your servants, and obey The beck of your least groom; obsequiously, We pray you but report of us so much, Submit us to you. Yet would I take farewell, May it not displease you, for old service' sake, Of one my servant here that was, and now Hath no word for me; yet I blame him not, Who am past all help of man; God witness me, I would not chide now, Gilbert, though my tongue Had strength yet left for chiding, and its edge Were yet a sword to smite with, or my wrath A thing that babes might shrink at; only this Take with you for your poor queen's true last word, That if they let me live so long to see The fair wife's face again from whose soft side, Now labouring with your child, by violent hands You are reft perforce for my sake, while I live I will have charge of her more carefully Than of mine own life's keeping, which indeed I think not long to keep, nor care, God knows, How soon or how men take it. Nay, good friend, Weep not; my weeping time is wellnigh past, And theirs whose eyes have too much wept for me Should last no longer. Sirs, I give you thanks For thus much grace and patience shown of you, My gentle gaolers, towards a queen unqueened Who shall nor get nor crave again of man What grace may rest in him to give her. Come, Bring me to bonds again, and her with me That hath not stood so nigh me all these years To fall ere life doth from my side, or take Her way to death without me till I die. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. WALSINGHAM. Scene I. Windsor Castle. Queen Elizabeth and Sir Francis Walsingham. Elizabeth. What will ye make me? Let the council know I am yet their loving mistress, but they lay Too strange a burden on my love who send As to their servant word what ways to take, What sentence of my subjects given subscribe And in mine own name utter. Bid them wait; Have I not patience? and was never quick To teach my tongue the deadly word of death, Lest one day strange tongues blot my fame with blood; The red addition of my sister's name Shall brand not mine. Walsingham. God grant your mercy shown Mark not your memory like a martyr's red With pure imperial heart's-blood of your own Shed through your own sweet-spirited height of heart That held your hand from justice. Elizabeth. I would rather Stand in God's sight so signed with mine own blood Than with a sister's—innocent; or indeed Though guilty—being a sister's—might I choose, As being a queen I may not surely—no— I may not choose, you tell me. Walsingham. Nay, no man Hath license of so large election given As once to choose, being servant called of God, If he will serve or no, or save the name And slack the service. Elizabeth. Yea, but in his Word I find no word that whets for king-killing The sword kings bear for justice; yet I doubt, Being drawn, it may not choose but strike at root— Being drawn to cut off treason. Walsingham, You are more a statesman than a gospeller; Take for your tongue's text now no text of God's, But what the devil has put into their lips Who should have slain me; nay, what by God's grace, Who bared their purpose to us, through pain or fear Hath been wrung thence of secrets writ in fire At bottom of their hearts. Have they confessed? Walsingham. The twain trapped first in London. Elizabeth. What, the priest? Their twice-turned Ballard, ha? Walsingham. Madam, not he. Elizabeth. God's blood! ye have spared not him the torment, knaves? Of all I would not spare him. Walsingham. Verily, no; The rack hath spun his life's thread out so fine There is but left for death to slit in twain The thickness of a spider's. Elizabeth. Ay, still dumb? Walsingham. Dumb for all good the pains can get of him; Had he drunk dry the chalice of his craft Brewed in design abhorred of even his friends With poisonous purpose toward your majesty, He had kept scarce harder silence. Elizabeth. Poison? ay— That should be still the churchman's household sword Or saintly staff to bruise crowned heads from far And break them with his precious balms that smell Rank as the jaws of death, or festal fume When Rome yet reeked with Borgia; but the rest Had grace enow to grant me for goodwill Some death more gracious than a rat's? God wot, I am bounden to them, and will charge for this The hangman thank them heartily; they shall not Lack daylight means to die by. God, meseems, Will have me not die darkling like a dog, Who hath kept my lips from poison and my heart From shot of English knave or Spanish, both Dubbed of the devil or damned his doctors, whom My riddance from all ills that plague man's life Should have made great in record; and for wage Your Ballard hath not better hap to fee Than Lopez had or Parry. Well, he lies As dumb in bonds as those dead dogs in earth, You say, but of his fellows newly ta'en There are that keep not silence: what say these? Pour in mine ears the poison of their plot Whose fangs have stung the silly snakes to death. Walsingham. The first a soldier, Savage, in these wars That sometime serving sought a traitor's luck Under the prince Farnese, then of late At Rheims was tempted of our traitors there, Of one in chief, Gifford the seminarist, My smock-faced spy's good uncle, to take off Or the earl of Leicester or your gracious self; And since his passage hither, to confirm His hollow-hearted hardihood, hath had Word from this doctor more solicitous yet Sent by my knave his nephew, who of late Was in the seminary of so deadly seed Their reader in philosophy, that their head, Even Cardinal Allen, holds for just and good The purpose laid upon his hand; this man Makes yet more large confession than of this, Saying from our Gilbert's trusty mouth he had Assurance that in Italy the Pope Hath levies raised against us, to set forth For seeming succour toward the Parmesan, But in their actual aim bent hither, where With French and Spaniards in one front of war They might make in upon us; but from France No foot shall pass for inroad on our peace Till—so they phrase it—by these Catholics here Your majesty be taken, or— Elizabeth. No more— But only taken? springed but bird-like? Ha! They are something tender of our poor personal chance— Temperately tender: yet I doubt the springe Had haply maimed me no less deep than life Sits next the heart most mortal. Or—so be it I slip the springe—what yet may shackle France, Hang weights upon their purpose who should else Be great of heart against us? They take time Till I be taken—or till what signal else As favourable? Walsingham. Till she they serve be brought Safe out of Paulet's keeping. Elizabeth. Ay? they know him So much my servant, and his guard so good, That sound of strange feet marching on our soil Against us in his prisoner's name perchance Might from the walls wherein she sits his guest Raise a funereal echo? Yet I think He would not dare—what think'st thou might he dare Without my word for warrant? If I knew This— Walsingham. It should profit not your grace to know What may not be conceivable for truth Without some stain on honour. Elizabeth. Nay, I say not That I would have him take upon his hand More than his trust may warrant: yet have men, Good men, for very truth of their good hearts Put loyal hand to work as perilous—well, God wot I would not have him so transgress— If such be called transgressors. Walsingham. Let the queen Rest well assured he shall not. So far forth Our swordsman Savage witnesses of these That moved him toward your murder but in trust Thereby to bring invasion over sea: Which one more gently natured of his birth, Tichborne, protests with very show of truth That he would give no ear to, knowing, he saith, The miseries of such conquest: nor, it seems, Heard this man aught of murderous purpose bent Against your highness. Elizabeth. Naught? why then, again, To him I am yet more bounden, who may think, Being found but half my traitor, at my hands To find but half a hangman. Walsingham. Nay, the man Herein seems all but half his own man, being Made merely out of stranger hearts and brains Their engine of conspiracy; for thus Forsooth he pleads, that Babington his friend First showed him how himself was wrought upon By one man's counsel and persuasion, one Held of great judgment, Ballard, on whose head All these lay all their forfeit. Elizabeth. Yet shall each Pay for himself red coin of ransom down In costlier drops than gold is. But of these Why take we thought? their natural-subject blood Can wash not out their sanguine-sealed attempt, Nor leave us marked as tyrant: only she That is the head and heart of all your fears Whose hope or fear is England's, quick or dead, Leaves or imperilled or impeached of blood Me that with all but hazard of mine own, God knows, would yet redeem her. I will write With mine own hand to her privily,—what else?— Saying, if by word as privy from her hand She will confess her treasonous practices, They shall be wrapped in silence up, and she By judgment live unscathed. Walsingham. Being that she is, So surely will she deem of your great grace, And see it but as a snare set wide, or net Spread in the bird's sight vainly. Elizabeth. Why, then, well: She, casting off my grace, from all men's grace Cuts off herself, and even aloud avows By silence and suspect of jealous heart Her manifest foul conscience: on which proof I will proclaim her to the parliament So self-convicted. Yet I would not have Her name and life by mortal evidence Touched at the trial of them that now shall die Or by their charge attainted: lest myself Fall in more peril of her friends than she Stands yet in shot of judgment. Walsingham. Be assured, Madam, the process of their treasons judged Shall tax not her before her trial-time With public note of clear complicity Even for that danger's sake which moves you. Elizabeth. Me So much it moves not for my mere life's sake Which I would never buy with fear of death As for the general danger's and the shame's Thence cast on queenship and on womanhood By mean of such a murderess. But, for them, I would the merited manner of their death Might for more note of terror be referred To me and to my council: these at least Shall hang for warning in the world's wide eye More high than common traitors, with more pains Being ravished forth of their more villainous lives Than feed the general throat of justice. Her Shall this too touch, whom none that serves henceforth But shall be sure of hire more terrible Than all past wage of treason. Walsingham. Why, so far As law gives leave— Elizabeth. What prat'st thou me of law? God's blood! is law for man's sake made, or man For law's sake only, to be held in bonds, Led lovingly like hound in huntsman's leash Or child by finger, not for help or stay, But hurt and hindrance? Is not all this land And all its hope and surety given to time Of sovereignty and freedom, all the fame And all the fruit of manhood hence to be, More than one rag or relic of its law Wherewith all these lie shackled? as too sure Have states no less than ours been done to death With gentle counsel and soft-handed rule For fear to snap one thread of ordinance Though thence the state were strangled. Walsingham. Madam, yet There need no need be here of law's least breach, That of all else is worst necessity— Being such a mortal medicine to the state As poison drunk to expel a feverish taint Which air or sleep might purge as easily. Elizabeth. Ay, but if air be poison-struck with plague Or sleep to death lie palsied, fools were they, Faint hearts and faithless, who for health's fair sake Should fear to cleanse air, pierce and probe the trance, With purging fire or iron. Have your way. God send good end of all this, and procure Some mean whereby mine enemies' craft and his May take no feet but theirs in their own toils, And no blood shed be innocent as mine. Scene II. Chartley. Mary Beaton and Sir Amyas Paulet. Paulet. You should do well to bid her less be moved Who needs fear less of evil. Since we came Again from Tixall this wild mood of hers Hath vexed her more than all men's enmities Should move a heart more constant. Verily, I thought she had held more rule upon herself Than to call out on beggars at the gate When she rode forth, crying she had nought to give, Being all as much a beggar too as they, With all things taken from her. Mary Beaton. Being so served, In sooth she should not show nor shame nor spleen: It was but seventeen days ye held her there Away from all attendance, as in bonds Kept without change of raiment, and to find, Being thence haled hither again, no nobler use, But all her papers plundered—then her keys By force of violent threat wrung from the hand She scarce could stir to help herself abed: These were no matters that should move her. Paulet. None, If she be clean of conscience, whole of heart, Nor else than pure in purpose, but maligned Of men's suspicions: how should one thus wronged But hold all hard chance good to approve her case Blameless, give praise for all, turn all to thanks That might unload her of so sore a charge, Despoiled not, but disburdened? Her great wrath Pleads hard against her, and itself spake loud Alone, ere other witness might unseal Wrath's fierce interpretation: which ere long Was of her secretaries expounded. Mary Beaton. Sir, As you are honourable, and of equal heart Have shown such grace as man being manful may To such a piteous prisoner as desires Nought now but what may hurt not loyalty Though you comply therewith to comfort her, Let her not think your spirit so far incensed By wild words of her mistress cast on you In heat of heart and bitter fire of spleen That you should now close ears against a prayer Which else might fairly find them open. Paulet. Speak More short and plainly: what I well may grant Shall so seem easiest granted. Mary Beaton. There should be No cause I think to seal your lips up, though I crave of them but so much breath as may Give mine ear knowledge of the witness borne (If aught of witness were against her borne) By those her secretaries you spake of. Paulet. This With hard expostulation was drawn forth At last of one and other, that they twain Had writ by record from their lady's mouth To Babington some letter which implies Close conscience of his treason, and goodwill To meet his service with complicity: But one thing found therein of deadliest note The Frenchman swore they set not down, nor she Bade write one word of favour nor assent Answering this murderous motion toward our queen: Only, saith he, she held herself not bound For love's sake to reveal it, and thereby For love of enemies do to death such friends As only for her own love's sake were found Fit men for murderous treason: and so much Her own hand's transcript of the word she sent Should once produced bear witness of her. Mary Beaton. Ay? How then came this withholden? Paulet. If she speak But truth, why, truth should sure be manifest, And shall, with God's good will, to good men's joy That wish not evil: as at Fotheringay When she shall come to trial must be tried If it be truth or no: for which assay You shall do toward her well and faithfully To bid her presently prepare her soul That it may there make answer. Mary Beaton. Presently? Paulet. Upon the arraignment of her friends who stand As 'twere at point of execution now Ere sentence pass upon them of their sin. Would you no more with me? Mary Beaton. I am bounden to you For thus much tidings granted. Paulet. So farewell. [Exit. Mary Beaton. So fare I well or ill as one who knows He shall not fare much further toward his end. Here looms on me the landmark of my life That I have looked for now some score of years Even with long-suffering eagerness of heart And a most hungry patience. I did know, Yea, God, thou knowest I knew this all that while, From that day forth when even these eyes beheld Fall the most faithful head in all the world, Toward her most loving and of me most loved, By doom of hers that was so loved of him He could not love me nor his life at all Nor his own soul nor aught that all men love, Nor could fear death nor very God, or care If there were aught more merciful in heaven Than love on earth had been to him. Chastelard I have not had the name upon my lips That stands for sign of love the truest in man Since first love made him sacrifice of men, This long sad score of years retributive Since it was cast out of her heart and mind Who made it mean a dead thing; nor, I think, Will she remember it before she die More than in France the memories of old friends Are like to have yet forgotten; but for me, Haply thou knowest, so death not all be death, If all these years I have had not in my mind Through all these chances this one thought in all, That I shall never leave her till she die. Nor surely now shall I much longer serve Who fain would lie down at her foot and sleep, Fain, fain have done with waking. Yet my soul Knows, and yet God knows, I would set not hand To such a work as might put on the time And make death's foot more forward for her sake: Yea, were it to deliver mine own soul From bondage and long-suffering of my life, I would not set mine hand to work her wrong. Tempted I was—but hath God need of me To work his judgment, bring his time about, Approve his justice if the word be just That whoso doeth shall suffer his own deed, Bear his own blow, to weep tears back for tears, And bleed for bloodshed? God should spare me this That once I held the one good hope on earth, To be the mean and engine of her end Or some least part at least therein: I prayed, God, give me so much grace—who now should pray, Tempt me not, God. My heart swelled once to know I bore her death about me; as I think Indeed I bear it: but what need hath God That I should clench his doom with craft of mine? What needs the wrath of hot Elizabeth Be blown aflame with mere past writing read, Which hath to enkindle it higher already proof Of present practice on her state and life? Shall fear of death or love of England fail Or memory faint or foresight fall stark blind, That there should need the whet and spur of shame To turn her spirit into some chafing snake's And make its fang more feared for mortal? Yet I am glad, and I repent me not, to know I have the writing in my bosom sealed That bears such matter with her own hand signed As she that yet repents her not to have writ Repents her not that she refrained to send And fears not but long since it felt the fire— Being fire itself to burn her, yet unquenched, But in my hand here covered harmless up Which had in charge to burn it. What perchance Might then the reading of it have wrought for us, If all this fiery poison of her scoffs Making the foul froth of a serpent's tongue More venomous, and more deadly toward her queen Even Bess of Hardwick's bitterest babbling tales, Had touched at heart the Tudor vein indeed? Enough it yet were surely, though that vein Were now the gentlest that such hearts may hold And all doubt's trembling balance that way bent, To turn as with one mortal grain cast in The scale of grace against her life that writ And weigh down pity deathward. Enter Mary Stuart. Mary Stuart. Have we found Such kindness of our keeper as may give Some ease from expectation? or must hope Still fret for ignorance how long here we stay As men abiding judgment? Mary Beaton. Now not long, He tells me, need we think to tarry; since The time and place of trial are set, next month To hold it in the castle of Fotheringay. Mary Stuart. Why, he knows well I were full easily moved To set forth hence; there must I find more scope To commune with the ambassador of France By letter thence to London: but, God help, Think these folk truly, doth she verily think, What never man durst yet nor woman dreamed, May one that is nor man nor woman think, To bring a queen born subject of no laws Here in subjection of an alien law By foreign force of judgment? Were she wise, Might she not have me privily made away? And being nor wise nor valiant but of tongue, Could she find yet foolhardiness of heart Enough to attaint the rule of royal rights With murderous madness? I will think not this Till it be proven indeed. Mary Beaton. A month come round, This man protests, will prove it. Mary Stuart. Ay! protests? What protestation of what Protestant Can unmake law that was of God's mouth made, Unwrite the writing of the world, unsay The general saying of ages? If I go, Compelled of God's hand or constrained of man's, Yet God shall bid me not nor man enforce My tongue to plead before them for my life. I had rather end as kings before me, die Rather by shot or stroke of murderous hands, Than so make answer once in face of man As one brought forth to judgment. Are they mad, And she most mad for envious heart of all, To make so mean account of me? Methought, When late we came back hither soiled and spent And sick with travel, I had seen their worst of wrong Full-faced, with its most outrage: when I found My servant Curle's young new-delivered wife Without priest's comfort and her babe unblessed A nameless piteous thing born ere its time, And took it from the mother's arms abed And bade her have good comfort, since myself Would take all charge against her husband laid On mine own head to answer; deeming not Man ever durst bid answer for myself On charge as mortal: and mine almoner gone, Did I not crave of Paulet for a grace His chaplain might baptize me this poor babe, And was denied it, and with mine own hands For shame and charity moved to christen her There with scant ritual in his heretic sight By mine own woful name, whence God, I pray, For her take off its presage? I misdeemed, Who deemed all these and yet far more than these For one born queen indignities enough, On one crowned head enough of buffets: more Hath time's hand laid upon me: yet I keep Faith in one word I spake to Paulet, saying Two things were mine though I stood spoiled of all As of my letters and my privy coin By pickpurse hands of office: these things yet Might none take thievish hold upon to strip His prisoner naked of her natural dower, The blood yet royal running here unspilled And that religion which I think to keep Fast as this royal blood until I die. So where at last and howsoe'er I fare I need not much take thought, nor thou for love Take of thy mistress pity; yet meseems They dare not work their open will on me: But God's it is that shall be done, and I Find end of all in quiet. I would sleep On this strange news of thine, that being awake I may the freshlier front my sense thereof And thought of life or death. Come in with me. Scene III. Tyburn. A Crowd of Citizens. 1st Citizen. Is not their hour yet on? Men say the queen Bade spare no jot of torment in their end That law might lay upon them. 2nd Citizen. Truth it is, To spare what scourge soe'er man's justice may Twist for such caitiff traitors were to grieve God's with mere inobservance. Hear you not How yet the loud lewd braggarts of their side Keep heart to threaten that for all this foil They are not foiled indeed, but yet the work Shall prosper with deliverance of their queen And death for her of ours, though they should give Of their own lives for one an hundredfold? 3rd Citizen. These are bold mouths; one that shall die to-day, Being this last week arraigned at Westminster, Had no such heart, they say, to his defence, Who was the main head of their treasons. 1st Citizen. Ay, And yesterday, if truth belie not him, Durst with his doomed hand write some word of prayer To the queen's self, her very grace, to crave Grace of her for his gracelessness, that she Might work on one too tainted to deserve A miracle of compassion, whence her fame For pity of sins too great for pity of man Might shine more glorious than his crime showed foul In the eye of such a mercy. 2nd Citizen. Yet men said He spake at his arraignment soberly With clear mild looks and gracious gesture, showing The purport of his treasons in such wise That it seemed pity of him to hear them, how All their beginnings and proceedings had First head and fountain only for their spring From ill persuasions of that poisonous priest Who stood the guiltiest near, by this man's side Approved a valiant villain. Barnwell next, Who came but late from Ireland here to court, Made simply protestation of design To work no personal ill against the queen Nor paint rebellion's face as murder's red With blood imperial: Tichborne then avowed He knew the secret of their aim, and kept, And held forsooth himself no traitor; yet In the end would even plead guilty, Donne with him, And Salisbury, who not less professed he still Stood out against the killing of the queen, And would not hurt her for a kingdom: so, When thus all these had pleaded, one by one Was each man bid say fairly, for his part, Why sentence should not pass: and Ballard first, Who had been so sorely racked he might not stand, Spake, but as seems to none effect: of whom Said Babington again, he set them on, He first, and most of all him, who believed This priest had power to assoil his soul alive Of all else mortal treason: Ballard then, As in sad scorn—Yea, Master Babington, Quoth he, lay all upon me, but I wish For you the shedding of my blood might be The saving of your life: howbeit, for that, Say what you will; and I will say no more. Nor spake the swordsman Savage aught again, Who, first arraigned, had first avowed his cause Guilty: nor yet spake Tichborne aught: but Donne Spake, and the same said Barnwell, each had sinned For very conscience only: Salisbury last Besought the queen remission of his guilt. Then spake Sir Christopher Hatton for the rest That sat with him commissioners, and showed How by dark doctrine of the seminaries And instance most of Ballard had been brought To extreme destruction here of body and soul A sort of brave youths otherwise endowed With goodly gifts of birthright: and in fine There was the sentence given that here even now Shows seven for dead men in our present sight And shall bring six to-morrow forth to die. Enter Babington, Ballard (carried in a chair), Tichborne, Savage, Barnwell, Tilney, and Abington, guarded: Sheriff, Executioner, Chaplain, &amp;c. 1st Citizen. What, will they speak? 2nd Citizen. Ay; each hath leave in turn To show what mood he dies in toward his cause. Ballard. Sirs, ye that stand to see us take our doom, I being here given this grace to speak to you Have but my word to witness for my soul, That all I have done and all designed to do Was only for advancement of true faith To furtherance of religion: for myself Aught would I never, but for Christ's dear church Was mine intent all wholly, to redeem Her sore affliction in this age and land, As now may not be yet: which knowing for truth, I am readier even at heart to die than live. And dying I crave of all men pardon whom My doings at all have touched, or who thereat Take scandal; and forgiveness of the queen If on this cause I have offended her. Savage. The like say I, that have no skill in speech, But heart enough with faith at heart to die, Seeing but for conscience and the common good, And no preferment but this general weal, I did attempt this business. Barnwell. I confess That I, whose seed was of that hallowed earth Whereof each pore hath sweated blood for Christ, Had note of these men's drifts, which I deny That ever I consented with or could In conscience hold for lawful. That I came To spy for them occasions in the court And there being noted of her majesty She seeing mine eyes peer sharply like a man's That had such purpose as she wist before Prayed God that all were well—if this were urged, I might make answer, it was not unknown To divers of the council that I there Had matters to solicit of mine own Which thither drew me then: yet I confess That Babington, espying me thence returned, Asked me what news: to whom again I told, Her majesty had been abroad that day, With all the circumstance I saw there. Now If I have done her majesty offence I crave her pardon: and assuredly If this my body's sacrifice might yet Establish her in true religion, here Most willingly should this be offered up. Tilney. I came not here to reason of my faith, But to die simply like a Catholic, praying Christ give our queen Elizabeth long life, And warning all youth born take heed by me. Abington. I likewise, and if aught I have erred in aught I crave but pardon as for ignorant sin, Holding at all points firm the Catholic faith; And all things charged against me I confess, Save that I ever sought her highness' death: In whose poor kingdom yet ere long I fear Will be great bloodshed. Sheriff. Seest thou, Abington, Here all these people present of thy kind Whose blood shall be demanded at thy hands If dying thou hide what might endanger them? Speak therefore, why or by what mortal mean Should there be shed such blood? Abington. All that I know You have on record: take but this for sure, This country lives for its iniquity Loathed of all countries, and God loves it not. Whereon I pray you trouble me no more With questions of this world, but let me pray And in mine own wise make my peace with God. Babington. For me, first head of all this enterprise, I needs must make this record of myself, I have not conspired for profit, but in trust Of men's persuasions whence I stood assured This work was lawful which I should have done And meritorious as toward God; for which No less I crave forgiveness of my queen And that my brother may possess my lands In heritage else forfeit with my head. Tichborne. Good countrymen and my dear friends, you look For something to be said of me, that am But an ill orator; and my text is worse. Vain were it to make full discourse of all This cause that brings me hither, which before Was all made bare, and is well known to most That have their eyes upon me: let me stand For all young men, and most for those born high, Their present warning here: a friend I had, Ay, and a dear friend, one of whom I made No small account, whose friendship for pure love To this hath brought me: I may not deny He told me all the matter, how set down, And ready to be wrought; which always I Held impious, and denied to deal therein: But only for my friend's regard was I Silent, and verified a saying in me, Who so consented to him. Ere this thing chanced, How brotherly we twain lived heart in heart Together, in what flourishing estate, This town well knows: of whom went all report Through her loud length of Fleetstreet and the Strand And all parts else that sound men's fortunate names, But Babington and Tichborne? that therein There was no haughtiest threshold found of force To brave our entry; thus we lived our life, And wanted nothing we might wish for: then, For me, what less was in my head, God knows, Than high state matters? Give me now but leave Scarce to declare the miseries I sustained Since I took knowledge of this action, whence To his estate I well may liken mine, Who could forbear not one forbidden thing To enjoy all else afforded of the world: The terror of my conscience hung on me; Who, taking heed what perils girt me, went To Sir John Peters hence in Essex, there Appointing that my horses by his mean Should meet me here in London, whence I thought To flee into the country: but being here I heard how all was now bewrayed abroad: Whence Adam-like we fled into the woods And there were taken. My dear countrymen, Albeit my sorrows well may be your joy, Yet mix your smiles with tears: pity my case, Who, born out of an house whose name descends Even from two hundred years ere English earth Felt Norman heel upon her, were it yet Till this mishap of mine unspotted. Sirs, I have a wife, and one sweet child: my wife, My dear wife Agnes: and my grief is there; And for six sisters too left on my hand: All my poor servants were dispersed, I know, Upon their master's capture: all which things Most heartily I sorrow for: and though Nought might I less have merited at her hands, Yet had I looked for pardon of my fault From the queen's absolute grace and clemency; That the unexpired remainder of my years Might in some sort have haply recompensed This former guilt of mine whereof I die: But seeing such fault may find not such release Even of her utter mercies, heartily I crave at least of her and all the world Forgiveness, and to God commend my soul, And to men's memory this my penitence Till our death's record die from out the land. 1st Citizen. God pardon him! Stand back: what ail these knaves To drive and thrust upon us? Help me, sir; I thank you: hence we take them full in view: Hath yet the hangman there his knife in hand? END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. BURGHLEY. Scene I. The presence-chamber in Fotheringay Castle. At the upper end, a chair of state as for Queen Elizabeth; opposite, in the centre of the hall, a chair for Mary Stuart. The Commissioners seated on either side along the wall: to the right, the Earls, with Lord Chancellor Bromley and Lord Treasurer Burghley; to the left, the Barons, with the Knights of the Privy Council, among them Walsingham and Paulet; Popham, Egerton, and Gawdy, as Counsel for the Crown. Enter Mary Stuart, supported by Sir Andrew Melville, and takes her place. Mary Stuart. Here are full many men of counsel met; Not one for me. [The Chancellor rises. Bromley. Madam, this court is held To make strait inquisition as by law Of what with grief of heart our queen has heard, A plot upon her life, against the faith Here in her kingdom stablished: on which cause Our charge it is to exact your answer here And put to proof your guilt or innocence. Mary Stuart (rising). Sirs, whom by strange constraint I stand before, My lords, and not my judges, since no law Can hold to mortal judgment answerable A princess free-born of all courts on earth, I rise not here to make response as one Responsible toward any for my life Or of mine acts accountable to man, Who see none higher save only God in heaven: I am no natural subject of your land That I should here plead as a criminal charged, Nor in such wise appear I now: I came On your queen's faith to seek in England help By trothplight pledged me: where by promise-breach I am even since then her prisoner held in ward: Yet, understanding by report of you Some certain things I know not of to be Against me brought on record, by my will I stand content to hear and answer these. Bromley. Madam, there lives none born on earth so high Who for this land's laws' breach within this land Shall not stand answerable before those laws. Burghley. Let there be record of the prisoner's plea And answer given such protest here set down, And so proceed we to this present charge. Gawdy. My lords, to unfold by length of circumstance The model of this whole conspiracy Should lay the pattern of all treasons bare: That ever brought high state in danger: this No man there lives among us but hath heard, How certain men of our queen's household folk Being wrought on by persuasion of their priests Drew late a bond between them, binding these With others of their faith accomplices Directed first of Anthony Babington By mean of six for execution chosen To slay the queen their mistress, and thereon Make all her trustiest men of trust away; As my lord treasurer Burghley present here, Lord Hunsdon, and Sir Francis Walsingham, And one that held in charge awhile agone This lady now on trial, Sir Francis Knowles. That she was hereto privy, to her power Approving and abetting their device, It shall not stand us in much need to show Whose proofs are manifoldly manifest On record written of their hands and hers. Mary Stuart. Of all this I know nothing: Babington I have used for mine intelligencer, sent With letters charged at need, but never yet Spake with him, never writ him word of mine As privy to these close conspiracies Nor word of his had from him. Never came One harmful thought upon me toward your queen, Nor knowledge ever that of other hearts Was harm designed against her. Proofs, ye say, Forsooth ye hold to impeach me: I desire But only to behold and handle them If they in sooth of sense be tangible More than mere air and shadow. Burghley. Let the clerk Produce those letters writ from Babington. Mary Stuart. What then? it may be such were writ of him: Be it proved that they came ever in my hands. If Babington affirm so much, I say He, or who else will say it, lies openly. Gawdy. Here is the man's confession writ, and here Ballard's the Jesuit, and the soldier's here, Savage, that served with Parma. Mary Stuart. What of these? Traitors they were, and traitor-like they lied. Gawdy. And here the last her letter of response Confirming and approving in each point Their purpose, writ direct to Babington. Mary Stuart. My letter? none of mine it is: perchance It may be in my cipher charactered, But never came from or my tongue or hand: I have sought mine own deliverance, and thereto Solicited of my friends their natural help: Yet certain whom I list not name there were, Whose offers made of help to set me free Receiving, yet I answered not a word. Howbeit, desiring to divert the storm Of persecution from the church, for this To your queen's grace I have made most earnest suit: But for mine own part I would purchase not This kingdom with the meanest one man's death In all its commonalty, much less the queen's. Many there be have dangerously designed Things that I knew not: yea, but very late There came a letter to my hand which craved My pardon if by enterprise of some Were undertaken aught unknown of me: A cipher lightly may one counterfeit, As he that vaunted him of late in France To be my son's base brother: and I fear Lest this, for aught mine ignorance of it knows, May be that secretary's fair handiwork Who sits to judge me, and hath practised late, I hear, against my son's life and mine own. But I protest I have not so much as thought Nor dreamed upon destruction of the queen: I had rather spend most gladly mine own life Than for my sake the Catholics should be thus Afflicted only in very hate of me And drawn to death so cruel as these tears Gush newly forth to think of. Burghley. Here no man Who hath showed himself true subject to the state Was ever for religion done to death: But some for treason, that against the queen Upheld the pope's bull and authority. Mary Stuart. Yet have I heard it otherwise affirmed And read in books set forth in print as much. Burghley. They that so write say too the queen hath here Made forfeit of her royal dignity. Walsingham. Here I call God to record on my part That personally or as a private man I have done nought misbeseeming honesty, Nor as I bear a public person's place Done aught thereof unworthy. I confess That, being right careful of the queen's estate And safety of this realm, I have curiously Searched out the practices against it: nay, Herein had Ballard offered me his help, I durst not have denied him; yea, I would Have recompensed the pains he had taken. Say I have practised aught with him, why did he not, To save his life, reveal it? Mary Stuart. Pray you, sir, Take no displeasure at me: truth it is Report has found me of your dealings, blown From lip to ear abroad, wherein myself I put no credit: and could but desire Yourself would all as little make account Of slanders flung on me. Spies, sure, are men Of doubtful credit, which dissemble things Far other than they speak. Do not believe That I gave ever or could give consent Once to the queen's destruction: I would never, These tears are bitter witness, never would Make shipwreck of my soul by compassing Destruction of my dearest sister. Gawdy. This Shall soon by witness be disproved: as here Even by this letter from Charles Paget's hand Transcribed, which Curle your secretary hath borne Plain witness you received, touching a league Betwixt Mendoza and Ballard, who conferred Of this land's foreordained invasion, thence To give you freedom. Mary Stuart. What of this? ye shoot Wide of the purpose: this approves not me Consenting to the queen's destruction. Gawdy. That Stands proven enough by word of Babington Who dying avowed it, and by letters passed From him to you, whom he therein acclaims As his most dread and sovereign lady and queen, And by the way makes mention passingly Of a plot laid by transference to convey This kingdom to the Spaniard. Mary Stuart. I confess There came a priest unto me, saying if I Would not herein bear part I with my son Alike should be debarred the inheritance: His name ye shall not have of me: but this Ye know, that openly the Spaniard lays Claim to your kingdom, and to none will give Place ever save to me. Burghley. Still stands the charge On written witness of your secretaries Great on all points against you. Mary Stuart. Wherefore then Are not these writers with these writings brought To outface me front to front? For Gilbert Curle, He is in the Frenchman's hands a waxen toy, Whom the other, once mine uncle's secretary, The cardinal's of Lorraine, at his mere will Moulds, turns, and tempers: being himself a knave That may be hired or scared with peril or coin To swear what thing men bid him. Truth again Is this that I deny not, seeing myself Against all right held fast in English ward, I have sought all help where I might hope to find: Which thing that I dispute not, let this be The sign that I disclaim no jot of truth In all objected to me. For the rest, All majesty that moves in all the world And all safe station of all princes born Fall, as things unrespected, to the ground, If on the testimony of secretaries And on their writings merely these depend, Being to their likeness thence debased: for me, Nought I delivered to them but what first Nature to me delivered, that I might Recover yet at length my liberty. I am not to be convicted save alone By mine own word or writing. If these men Have written toward the queen my sister's hurt Aught, I wist nought of all such writ at all: Let them be put to punishment: I am sure, Were these here present, they by testimony Would bring me clear of blame. Gawdy. Yet by their mean They could not in excuse of you deny That letters of communion to and fro Have passed between you and the Spaniard, whence What should have come on England and the queen These both well know, and with what messages Were English exiles entertained of you By mean of these men, of your secretaries, Confirmed and cherished in conspiracy For this her kingdom's overthrow: in France Paget and Morgan, traitors in design Of one close mind with you, and in your name Cheered hence for constant service. Mary Stuart. That I sought Comfort and furtherance of all Catholic states By what mean found soever just and good, Your mistress from myself had note long since And open warning: uncompelled I made Avowal of such my righteous purpose, nor In aught may disavow it. Of these late plots No proof is here to attaint mine innocence, Who dare all proof against me: Babington I know not of, nor Ballard, nor their works, But kings my kinsmen, powers that serve the church, These I confess my comforters, in hope Held fast of their alliance. Yet again I challenge in the witness of my words The notes writ of these letters here alleged In mine own hand: if these ye bring not forth, Judge all good men if I be not condemned In all your hearts already, who perchance For all this pageant held of lawless law Have bound yourselves by pledge to speak me dead: But I would have you look into your souls, Remembering how the theatre of the world Is wider, in whose eye ye are judged that judge, Than this one realm of England. Burghley. Toward that realm Suffice it here that, madam, you stand charged With deadly purpose: being of proven intent To have your son conveyed to Spain, and give The title you pretend upon our crown Up with his wardship to King Philip. Mary Stuart. Nay, I have no kingdom left to assign, nor crown Whereof to make conveyance: yet is this But lawful, that of all things which are mine I may dispose at pleasure, and to none Stand on such count accountable. Burghley. So be it So far as may be: but your ciphers sent By Curle's plain testimony to Babington, To the lord Lodovic, and to Fernihurst, Once provost on your part in Edinburgh By mean of Grange your friend his father-in-law, Speak not but as with tongue imperial, nor Of import less than kingdoms. Mary Stuart. Surely, sir, Such have I writ, and many; nor therein Beyond my birth have trespassed, to commend That lord you speak of, and another, both My friends in faith, to a cardinal's dignity, And that, I trust, without offence: except It be not held as lawful on my part To commune with the chiefest of my creed By written word on matters of mine own As for your queen with churchfolk of her kind. Burghley. Well were it, madam, that with some of yours You had held less close communion: since by proof Reiterated from those your secretaries It seems you know right well that Morgan, who Sent Parry privily to despatch the queen, And have assigned him annual pension. Mary Stuart. This I know not, whether or no your charge be truth, But I do know this Morgan hath lost all For my sake, and in honour sure I am That rather to relieve him I stand bound Than to revenge an injury done your queen By one that lives my friend, and hath deserved Well at mine hands: yet, being not bound to this, I did affright the man from such attempts Of crimes against her, who contrariwise Hath out of England openly assigned Pensions to Gray my traitor, and the Scots Mine adversaries, as also to my son, To hire him to forsake me. Burghley. Nay, but seeing By negligence of them that steered the state The revenues of Scotland sore impaired Somewhat in bounty did her grace bestow Upon your son the king, her kinsman: whom She would not, being to her so near of blood, Forget from charity. No such help it was Nor no such honest service that your friends Designed you, who by letters hither writ To Paget and Mendoza sent as here Large proffers of strange aid from oversea To right you by her ruin. Mary Stuart. Here was nought Aimed for your queen's destruction: nor is this Against me to be charged, that foreign friends Should labour for my liberty. Thus much At sundry times I have signified aloud By open message to her, that I would still Seek mine own freedom. Who shall bar me this? Who tax me with unreason, that I sent Unjust conditions on my part to be To her propounded, which now many times Have alway found rejection? yea, when even For hostages I proffered in my stead To be delivered up with mine own son The duke of Guise's, both to stand in pledge That nor your queen nor kingdom should through me Take aught of damage; so that hence by proof I see myself utterly from all hope Already barred of freedom. But I now Am dealt with most unworthily, whose fame And honourable repute are called in doubt Before such foreign men of law as may By miserable conclusions of their craft Draw every thin and shallow circumstance Out into compass of a consequence: Whereas the anointed heads and consecrate Of princes are not subject to such laws As private men are. Next, whereas ye are given Authority but to look such matters through As tend to the hurt of your queen's person, yet Here is the cause so handled, and so far Here are my letters wrested, that the faith Which I profess, the immunity and state Of foreign princes, and their private right Of mutual speech by word reciprocate From royal hand to royal, all in one Are called in question, and myself by force Brought down beneath my kingly dignity And made to appear before a judgment-seat As one held guilty; to none end but this, All to none other purpose but that I Might from all natural favour of the queen Be quite excluded, and my right cut off From claim hereditary: whereas I stand Here of mine own goodwill to clear myself Of all objected to me, lest I seem To have aught neglected in the full defence Of mine own innocency and honour. This Would I bring likewise in your minds, how once This queen herself of yours, Elizabeth, Was drawn in question of conspiracy That Wyatt raised against her sister, yet Ye know she was most innocent. For me, With very heart's religion I affirm, Though I desire the Catholics here might stand Assured of safety, this I would not yet Buy with the blood and death of any one. And on mine own part rather would I play Esther than Judith; for the people's sake To God make intercession, than deprive The meanest of the people born of life. Mine enemies have made broad report aloud That I was irreligious: yet the time Has been I would have learnt the faith ye hold, But none would suffer me, for all I sought, To find such teaching at your teachers' hands; As though they cared not what my soul became. And now at last, when all ye can ye have done Against me, and have barred me from my right, Ye may chance fail yet of your cause and hope. To God and to the princes of my kin I make again appeal, from you again Record my protestation, and reject All judgment of your court: I had rather die Thus undishonoured, even a thousand deaths, Than so bring down the height of majesty; Yea, and thereby confess myself as bound By all the laws of England, even in faith Of things religious, who could never learn What manner of laws these were: I am destitute Of counsellors, and who shall be my peers To judge my cause through and give doom thereon I am ignorant wholly, being an absolute queen, And will do nought which may impair that state In me nor other princes, nor my son; Since yet my mind is not dejected, nor Will I sink under my calamity. My notes are taken from me, and no man Dares but step forth to be my advocate. I am clear from all crime done against the queen, I have stirred not up one man against her: yet, Albeit of many dangers overpast I have thoroughly forewarned her, still I found No credit, but have always been contemned, Though nearest to her in blood allied. When late Ye made association, and thereon An act against their lives on whose behalf, Though innocent even as ignorance of it, aught Might be contrived to endangering of the queen From foreign force abroad, or privy plots At home of close rebellion, I foresaw That, whatsoever of peril so might rise Or more than all this for religion's sake, My many mortal enemies in her court Should lay upon me all the charge, and I Bear the whole blame of all men. Certainly, I well might take it hardly, nor without High cause, that such confederacy was made With mine own son, and I not knowing: but this I speak not of, being not so grieved thereat As that mine own dear sister, that the queen, Is misinformed of me, and I, now kept These many years in so strait prison, and grown Lame of my limbs, have lien neglected, nor For all most reasonable conditions made Or proffered to redeem my liberty Found audience or acceptance: and at last Here am I set with none to plead for me. But this I pray, that on this matter of mine Another meeting there be kept, and I Be granted on my part an advocate To hold my cause up; or that seeing ye know I am a princess, I may be believed By mine own word, being princely: for should I Stand to your judgment, who most plainly I see Are armed against me strong in prejudice, It were mine extreme folly: more than this, That ever I came to England in such trust As of the plighted friendship of your queen And comfort of her promise. Look, my lords, Here on this ring: her pledge of love was this And surety sent me when I lay in bonds Of mine own rebels once: regard it well: In trust of this I came amongst you: none But sees what faith I have found to keep this trust. Burghley. Whereas I bear a double person, being Commissioner first, then counsellor in this cause, From me as from the queen's commissioner here Receive a few words first. Your protest made Is now on record, and a transcript of it Shall be delivered you. To us is given Under the queen's hand our authority, whence Is no appeal, this grant being ratified With the great seal of England; nor are we With prejudice come hither, but to judge By the straight rule of justice. On their part, These the queen's learned counsel here in place Do level at nothing else but that the truth May come to light, how far you have made offence Against the person of the queen. To us Full power is given to hear and diligently Examine all the matter, though yourself Were absent: yet for this did we desire To have your presence here, lest we might seem To have derogated from your honour: nor Designed to object against you anything But what you knew of, or took part therein, Against the queen's life bent. For this were these Your letters brought in question, but to unfold Your aim against her person, and therewith All matters to it belonging; which perforce Are so with other matters interlaced As none may sever them. Hence was there need Set all these forth, not parcels here and there, Whose circumstances do the assurance give Upon what points you dealt with Babington. Mary Stuart. The circumstances haply may find proof, But the fact never. Mine integrity Nor on the memory nor the credit hangs Of these my secretaries, albeit I know They are men of honest hearts: yet if they have Confessed in fear of torture anything Or hope of guerdon and impunity, It may not be admitted, for just cause, Which I will otherwhere allege. Men's minds Are with affections diversly distraught And borne about of passion: nor would these Have ever avowed such things against me, save For their own hope and profit. Letters may Toward other hands be outwardly addressed Than they were writ for: yea, and many times Have many things been privily slipped in mine Which from my tongue came never. Were I not Reft of my papers, and my secretary Kept from me, better might I then confute These things cast up against me. Burghley. But there shall Be nothing brought against you save what last Stands charged, even since the nineteenth day of June: Nor would your papers here avail you, seeing Your secretaries, and Babington himself, Being of the rack unquestioned, have affirmed You sent those letters to him; which though yourself Deny, yet whether more belief should here On affirmation or negation hang Let the commissioners judge. But, to come back, This next I tell you as a counsellor, Time after time you have put forth many things Propounded for your freedom; that all these Have fallen all profitless, 'tis long of you, And of the Scots; in no wise of the queen. For first the lords of Scotland, being required, Flatly refused, to render up the king In hostage: and when treaty last was held Upon your freedom, then was Parry sent By your dependant Morgan privily To make the queen away by murder. Mary Stuart. Ah! You are my adversary. Burghley. Yea, surely I am To the queen's adversaries an adversary. But now hereof enough: let us proceed Henceforth to proofs. Mary Stuart. I will not hear them. Burghley. Yet Hear them will we. Mary Stuart. And in another place I too will hear them, and defend myself. Gawdy. First let your letters to Charles Paget speak, Wherein you show him there is none other way For Spain to bring the Netherlands again To the old obedience, but by setting up A prince in England that might help his cause: Then to Lord Paget, to bring hastilier His forces up for help to invade this land: And Cardinal Allen's letter, hailing you His most dread sovereign lady, and signifying The matter to the prince of Parma's care To be commended. Mary Stuart. I am so sore beset I know not how by point and circumstance To meet your manifold impeachments: this I see through all this charge for evil truth, That Babington and my two secretaries Have even to excuse themselves accused me: yet, As touching that conspiracy, this I say, Of those six men for execution chosen I never heard: and all the rest is nought To this pretended purpose of your charge. For Cardinal Allen, whatsoe'er he have writ, I hold him for a reverend prelate, so To be esteemed, no more: none save the Pope Will I acknowledge for the church's head And sovereign thence on thought or spirit of mine: But in what rank and place I stand esteemed Of him and foreign princes through the world I know not: neither can I hinder them By letters writ of their own hearts and hands To hail me queen of England. As for those Whose duty and plain allegiance sworn to me Stands flawed in all men's sight, my secretaries, These merit no belief. They which have once Forsworn themselves, albeit they swear again With oaths and protestations ne'er so great, Are not to be believed. Nor may these men By what sworn oath soever hold them bound In court of conscience, seeing they have sworn to me Their secrecy and fidelity before, And are no subjects of this country. Nau Hath many times writ other than I bade, And Curle sets down whate'er Nau bids him write But for my part I am ready in all to bear The burden of their fault, save what may lay A blot upon mine honour. Haply too These things did they confess to save themselves; Supposing their avowal could hurt not me, Who, being a queen, they thought, good ignorant men, More favourably must needs be dealt withal. For Ballard, I ne'er heard of any such, But of one Hallard once that proffered me Such help as I would none of, knowing this man Had vowed his service too to Walsingham. Gawdy. Next, from your letters to Mendoza, writ By Curle, as freely his confession shows, In privy cipher, take these few brief notes For perfect witness of your full design. You find yourself, the Spaniard hears thereby, Sore troubled what best course to take anew For your affairs this side the sea, whereon Charles Paget hath a charge to impart from you Some certain overtures to Spain and him In your behalf, whom you desire with prayer Show freely what he thinks may be obtained Thus from the king his master. One point more Have you reserved thereon depending, which On your behalf you charge him send the king Some secret word concerning, no man else, If this be possible, being privy to it: Even this, that seeing your son's great obstinacy In heresy, and foreseeing too sure thereon Most imminent danger and harm thence like to ensue To the Catholic church, he coming to bear rule Within this kingdom, you are resolved at heart In case your son be not reduced again To the Catholic faith before your death, whereof Plainly you say small hope is yours so long As he shall bide in Scotland, to give up To that said king, and grant in absolute right, Your claim upon succession to this crown, By your last will made; praying him on this cause From that time forth wholly to take yourself Into his keeping, and therewith the state And charge of all this country: which, you say, You cannot for discharge of conscience think That you could put into a prince's hands More zealous for your faith, and abler found To build it strong upon this side again, Even as through all parts else of Christendom. But this let silence keep in secret, lest Being known it be your dowry's loss in France, And open breach in Scotland with your son, And in this realm of England utterly Your ruin and destruction. On your part Next is he bidden thank his lord the king For liberal grace and sovereign favour shown Lord Paget and his brother, which you pray him Most earnestly to increase, and gratify Poor Morgan with some pension for your sake Who hath not for your sake only endured so much But for the common cause. Likewise, and last, Is one he knows commended to his charge With some more full supply to be sustained Than the entertainment that yourself allot According to the little means you have. Burghley. Hereon stands proof apparent of that charge Which you but now put by, that you design To give your right supposed upon this realm Into the Spaniard's hold; and on that cause Lie now at Rome Allen and Parsons, men Your servants and our traitors. Mary Stuart. No such proof Lives but by witness of revolted men, My traitors and your helpers; who to me Have broken their allegiance bound by oath. When being a prisoner clothed about with cares I languished out of hope of liberty, Nor yet saw hope to effect of those things aught Which many and many looked for at my hands, Declining now through age and sickness, this To some seemed good, even for religion's sake, That the succession here of the English crown Should or be stablished in the Spanish king Or in some English Catholic. And a book Was sent to me to avow the Spaniard's claim; Which being of me allowed not, some there were In whose displeasure thence I fell; but now Seeing all my hope in England desperate grown, I am fully minded to reject no aid Abroad, but resolute to receive it. Walsingham. Sirs, Bethink you, were the kingdom so conveyed, What should become of you and all of yours, Estates and honours and posterities, Being to such hands delivered. Burghley. Nay, but these In no such wise can be conveyed away By personal will, but by successive right Still must descend in heritage of law. Whereto your own words witness, saying if this Were blown abroad your cause were utterly Lost in all hearts of English friends. Therein Your thoughts hit right: for here in all men's minds That are not mad with envying at the truth Death were no loathlier than a stranger king. If you would any more, speak: if not aught, This cause is ended. Mary Stuart. I require again Before a full and open parliament Hearing, or speech in person with the queen, Who shall, I hope, have of a queen regard, And with the council. So, in trust hereof, I crave a word with some of you apart, And of this main assembly take farewell. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. ELIZABETH. Scene I. Richmond. Walsingham and Davison. Walsingham. It is God's wrath, too sure, that holds her hand; His plague upon this people, to preserve By her sole mean her deadliest enemy, known By proof more potent than approof of law In all points guilty, but on more than all Toward all this country dangerous. To take off From the court held last month at Fotheringay Authority with so full commission given To pass upon her judgment—suddenly Cut short by message of some three lines writ With hurrying hand at midnight, and despatched To maim its work upon the second day, What else may this be in so wise a queen But madness, as a brand to sear the brain Of one by God infatuate? yea, and now That she receives the French ambassador With one more special envoy from his king, Except their message touch her spleen with fire And so undo itself, we cannot tell What doubt may work upon her. Had we but Some sign more evident of some private seal Confirming toward her by more personal proof The Scottish queen's inveteracy, for this As for our country plucked from imminent death We might thank God: but with such gracious words Of piteous challenge and imperial plea She hath wrought by letter on our mistress' mind, We may not think her judgment so could slip, Borne down with passion or forgetfulness, As to leave bare her bitter root of heart And core of evil will there labouring. Davison. Yet I see no shade of other surety cast From any sign of likelihood. It were Not shameful more than dangerous, though she bade, To have her prisoner privily made away; Yet stands the queen's heart wellnigh fixed hereon When aught may seem to fix it; then as fast Wavers, but veers to that bad point again Whence blowing the wind blows down her honour, nor Brings surety of life with fame's destruction. Walsingham. Ay, We are no Catholic keepers, and his charge Need fear no poison in our watch-dog's fang, Though he show honest teeth at her, to threat Thieves' hands with loyal danger. Enter Queen Elizabeth, attended by Burghley, Leicester, Hunsdon, Hatton, and others of the Council. Elizabeth. No, my lords, We are not so weak of wit as men that need Be counselled of their enemies. Blame us not That we accuse your friendship on this cause Of too much fearfulness: France we will hear, Nor doubt but France shall hear us all as loud As friend or foe may threaten or protest, Of our own heart advised, and resolute more Than hearts that need men's counsel. Bid them in. Enter Châteauneuf and Bellièvre, attended. From our fair cousin of France what message, sirs? Bellièvre. I, madam, have in special charge to lay The king's mind open to your majesty, Which gives my tongue first leave of speech more free Than from a common envoy. Sure it is, No man more grieves at what his heart abhors, The counsels of your highness' enemies, Than doth the king of France: wherein how far The queen your prisoner have borne part, or may Seem of their works partaker, he can judge Nought: but much less the king may understand What men may stand accusers, who rise up Judge in so great a matter. Men of law May lay their charges on a subject: but The queen of Scotland, dowager queen of France, And sister made by wedlock to the king, To none being subject, can be judged of none Without such violence done on rule as breaks Prerogative of princes. Nor may man That looks upon your present majesty In such clear wise apparent, and retains Remembrance of your name through all the world For virtuous wisdom, bring his mind to think That England's royal-souled Elizabeth, Being set so high in fame, can so forget Wise Plato's word, that common souls are wrought Out of dull iron and slow lead, but kings Of gold untempered with so vile alloy As makes all metal up of meaner men. But say this were not thus, and all men's awe Were from all time toward kingship merely vain, And state no more worth reverence, yet the plea Were nought which here your ministers pretend, That while the queen of Scots lives you may live No day that knows not danger. Were she dead, Rather might then your peril wax indeed To shape and sense of heavier portent, whom The Catholic states now threat not, nor your land, For this queen's love, but rather for their faith's, Whose cause, were she by violent hand removed, Could be but furthered, and its enterprise Put on more strong and prosperous pretext; yea, You shall but draw the invasion on this land Whose threat you so may think to stay, and bring Imminence down of inroad. Thus far forth The queen of Scots hath for your person been Even as a targe or buckler which has caught All intercepted shafts against your state Shot, or a stone held fast within your hand, Which, if you cast it thence in fear or wrath To smite your adversary, is cast away, And no mean left therein for menace. If You lay but hand upon her life, albeit There were that counselled this, her death will make Your enemies weapons of their own despair And give their whetted wrath excuse and edge More plausibly to strike more perilously. Your grace is known for strong in foresight: we These nineteen years of your wise reign have kept Fast watch in France upon you: of those claims Which lineally this queen here prisoner may Put forth on your succession have you made The stoutest rampire of your rule: and this Is grown a byword with us, that their cause Who shift the base whereon their policies lean Bows down toward ruin: and of loyal heart This will I tell you, madam, which hath been Given me for truth assured of one whose place Affirms him honourable, how openly A certain prince's minister that well May stand in your suspicion says abroad That for his master's greatness it were good The queen of Scots were lost already, seeing He is well assured the Catholics here should then All wholly range them on his master's part. Thus long hath reigned your highness happily, Who have loved fair temperance more than violence: now, While honour bids have mercy, wisdom holds Equal at least the scales of interest. Think What name shall yours be found in time far hence, Even as you deal with her that in your hand Lies not more subject than your fame to come In men's repute that shall be. Bid her live, And ever shall my lord stand bound to you And you for ever firm in praise of men. Elizabeth. I am sorry, sir, you are hither come from France Upon no better errand. I appeal To God for judge between my cause and hers Whom here you stand for. In this realm of mine The queen of Scots sought shelter, and therein Hath never found but kindness; for which grace In recompense she hath three times sought my life. No grief that on this head yet ever fell Shook ever from mine eyes so many a tear As this last plot upon it. I have read As deep I doubt me in as many books As any queen or prince in Christendom, Yet never chanced on aught so strange and sad As this my state's calamity. Mine own life Is by mere nature precious to myself, And in mine own realm I can live not safe. I am a poor lone woman, girt about With secret enemies that perpetually Lay wait for me to kill me. From your king Why have not I my traitor to my hands Delivered up, who now this second time Hath sought to slay me, Morgan? On my part, Had mine own cousin Hunsdon here conspired Against the French king's life, he had found not so Refuge of me, nor even for kindred's sake From the edge of law protection: and this cause Needs present evidence of this man's mouth. Bellièvre. Madam, there stand against the queen of Scots Already here in England on this charge So many and they so dangerous witnesses No need can be to bring one over more: Nor can the king show such unnatural heart As to send hither a knife for enemies' hands To cut his sister's throat. Most earnestly My lord expects your resolution: which If we receive as given against his plea, I must crave leave to part for Paris hence. Yet give me pardon first if yet once more I pray your highness be assured, and so Take heed in season, you shall find this queen More dangerous dead than living. Spare her life, And not my lord alone but all that reign Shall be your sureties in all Christian lands Against all scathe of all conspiracies Made on her party: while such remedies' ends As physic states with bloodshedding, to cure Danger by death, bring fresh calamities Far oftener forth than the old are healed of them Which so men thought to medicine. To refrain From that red-handed way of rule, and set Justice no higher than mercy sits beside, Is the first mean of kings' prosperity That would reign long: nor will my lord believe Your highness could put off yourself so much As to reverse and tread upon the law That you thus long have kept and honourably: But should this perilous purpose hold right on, I am bounden by my charge to say, the king Will not regard as liable to your laws A queen's imperial person, nor will hold Her death as but the general wrong of kings And no more his than as his brethren's all, But as his own and special injury done, More than to these injurious. Elizabeth. Doth your lord Bid you speak thus? Bellièvre. Ay, madam: from his mouth Had I command what speech to use. Elizabeth. You have done Better to speak than he to send it. Sir, You shall not presently depart this land As one denied of mere discourtesy. I will return an envoy of mine own To speak for me at Paris with the king. You shall bear back a letter from my hand, And give your lord assurance, having seen, I cannot be so frighted with men's threats That they shall not much rather move my mind To quicken than to slack the righteous doom Which none must think by menace to put back, Or daunt it with defiance. Sirs, good day. [Exeunt Ambassadors. I were as one belated with false lights If I should think to steer my darkling way By twilight furtherance of their wiles and words. Think you, my lords, France yet would have her live? Burghley. If there be other than the apparent end Hid in this mission to your majesty, Mine envoys can by no means fathom it, Who deal for me at Paris: fear of Spain Lays double hand as 'twere upon the king, Lest by removal of the queen of Scots A way be made for peril in the claim More potent then of Philip; and if there come From his Farnese note of enterprise Or danger this way tending, France will yet Cleave to your friendship though his sister die. Elizabeth. So, in your mind, this half-souled brother would Steer any way that might keep safe his sail Against a southern wind, which here, he thinks, Her death might strengthen from the north again To blow against him off our subject straits, Made servile then and Spanish? Yet perchance There swells behind our seas a heart too high To bow more easily down, and bring this land More humbly to such handling, than their waves Bow down to ships of strangers, or their storms To breath of any lord on earth but God. What thinks our cousin? Hunsdon. That if Spain or France Or both be stronger than the heart in us Which beats to battle ere they menace, why, In God's name, let them rise and make their prey Of what was England: but if neither be, The smooth-cheeked French man-harlot, nor that hand Which holp to light Rome's fires with English limbs, Let us not keep to make their weakness strong A pestilence here alive in England, which Gives force to their faint enmities, and burns Half the heart out of loyal trust and hope With heat that kindles treason. Elizabeth. By this light, I have heard worse counsel from a wise man's tongue Than this clear note of forthright soldiership. How say you, Dudley, to it? Leicester. Madam, ere this You have had my mind upon the matter, writ But late from Holland, that no public stroke Should fall upon this princess, who may be By privy death more happily removed Without impeach of majesty, nor leave A sign against your judgment, to call down Blame of strange kings for wrong to kingship wrought Though right were done to justice. Elizabeth. Of your love We know it is that comes this counsel; nor, Had we such friends of all our servants, need Our mind be now distraught with dangerous doubts That find no screen from dangers. Yet meseems One doubt stands now removed, if doubt there were Of aught from Scotland ever: Walsingham, You should have there intelligence whereof To make these lords with us partakers. Walsingham. Nay, Madam, no more than from a trustless hand Protest and promise: of those twain that come Hot on these Frenchmen's heels in embassy, He that in counsel on this cause was late One with my lord of Leicester now, to rid By draught of secret death this queen away, Bears charge to say as these gone hence have said In open audience, but by personal note Hath given me this to know, that howsoe'er His king indeed desire her life be spared Much may be wrought upon him, would your grace More richly line his ragged wants with gold And by full utterance of your parliament Approve him heir in England. Elizabeth. Ay! no more? God's blood! what grace is proffered us at need, And on what mild conditions! Say I will not Redeem such perils at so dear a price, Shall not our pensioner too join hands with France And pay my gold with iron barter back At edge of sword he dares not look upon, They tell us, for the scathe and scare he took Even in this woman's womb when shot and steel Undid the manhood in his veins unborn And left his tongue's threats handless? Walsingham. Men there be, Your majesty must think, who bear but ill, For pride of country and high-heartedness, To see the king they serve your servant so That not his mother's life and once their queen's Being at such point of peril can enforce One warlike word of his for chance of war Conditional against you. Word came late From Edinburgh that there the citizens With hoot and hiss had bayed him through the streets As he went heartless by; of whom they had heard This published saying, that in his personal mind The blood of kindred or affinity So much not binds us as the friendship pledged To them that are not of our blood: and this Stands clear for certain, that no breath of war Shall breathe from him against us though she die, Except his titular claim be reft from him On our succession: and that all his mind Is but to reign unpartnered with a power Which should weigh down that half his kingdom's weight Left to his hand's share nominally in hold: And for his mother, this would he desire, That she were kept from this day to her death Close prisoner in one chamber, never more To speak with man or woman: and hereon That proclamation should be made of her As of one subject formally declared To the English law whereby, if she offend Again with iterance of conspiracy, She shall not as a queen again be tried, But as your vassal and a private head Live liable to the doom and stroke of death. Elizabeth. She is bounden to him as he long since to her, Who would have given his kingdom up at least To his dead father's slayer, in whose red hand How safe had lain his life too doubt may guess, Which yet kept dark her purpose then on him, Dark now no more to usward. Think you then That they belie him, whose suspicion saith His ear and heart are yet inclined to Spain, If from that brother-in-law that was of ours And would have been our bridegroom he may win Help of strange gold and foreign soldiership, With Scottish furtherance of those Catholic lords Who are stronger-spirited in their faith than ours, Being harried more of heretics, as they say, Than these within our borders, to root out The creed there stablished now, and do to death Its ministers, with all the lords their friends, Lay hands on all strong places there, and rule As prince upon their party? since he fain From ours would be divided, and cast in His lot with Rome against us too, from these Might he but earn assurance of their faith, Revolting from his own. May these things be More than mere muttering breath of trustless lies, And half his heart yet hover toward our side For all such hope or purpose? Walsingham. Of his heart We know not, madam, surely; nor doth he Who follows fast on their first envoy sent, And writes to excuse him of his message here On her behalf apparent, but in sooth Aimed otherwise; the Master I mean of Gray, Who swears me here by letter, if he be not True to the queen of England, he is content To have his head fall on a scaffold: saying, To put from him this charge of embassy Had been his ruin, but the meaning of it Is modest and not menacing: whereto If you will yield not yet to spare the life So near its forfeit now, he thinks it well You should be pleased by some commission given To stay by the way his comrade and himself, Or bid them back. Elizabeth. What man is this then, sent With such a knave to fellow? Walsingham. No such knave, But still your prisoner's friend of old time found: Sir Robert Melville. Elizabeth. And an honest man As faith might wish her servants: but what pledge Will these produce me for security That I may spare this dangerous life and live Unscathed of after practice? Walsingham. As I think, The king's self and his whole nobility Will be her personal pledges; and her son, If England yield her to his hand in charge, On no less strait a bond will undertake For her safe keeping. Elizabeth. That were even to arm With double power mine adversary, and make him The stronger by my hand to do me hurt— Were he mine adversary indeed: which yet I will not hold him. Let them find a mean For me to live unhurt and save her life, It shall well please me. Say this king of Scots Himself would give his own inheritance up Pretended in succession, if but once Her hand were found or any friend's of hers Again put forth upon me for her sake, Why, haply so might hearts be satisfied Of lords and commons then to let her live. But this I doubt he had rather take her life Himself than yield up to us for pledge: and less, These men shall know of me, I will not take In price of her redemption: which were else, And haply may in no wise not be held, To this my loyal land and mine own trust A deadlier stroke and blast of sound more dire Than noise of fleets invasive. Walsingham. Surely so Would all hearts hold it, madam, in that land That are not enemies of the land and yours; For ere the doom had been proclaimed an hour Which gave to death your main foe's head and theirs Yourself have heard what fire of joy brake forth From all your people: how their church-towers all Rang in with jubilant acclaim of bells The day that bore such tidings, and the night That laughed aloud with lightning of their joy And thundered round its triumph: twice twelve hours This tempest of thanksgiving roared and shone Sheer from the Solway's to the Channel's foam With light as from one festal-flaming hearth And sound as of one trumpet: not a tongue But praised God for it, or heart that leapt not up, Save of your traitors and their country's: these Withered at heart and shrank their heads in close, As though the bright sun's were a basilisk's eye, And light, that gave all others comfort, flame And smoke to theirs of hell's own darkness, whence Such eyes were blinded or put out with fire. Elizabeth. Yea, I myself, I mind me, might not sleep Those twice twelve hours thou speak'st of. By God's light, Be it most in love of me or fear of her I know not, but my people seems in sooth Hot and anhungered on this trail of hers: Nor is it a people bloody-minded, used To lap the life up of an enemy's vein Who bleeds to death unweaponed: our good hounds Will course a quarry soldierlike in war, But rage not hangmanlike upon the prey, To flesh their fangs on limbs that strive not: yet Their hearts are hotter on this course than mine, Which most was deadliest aimed at. Walsingham. Even for that How should not theirs be hot as fire from hell To burn your danger up and slay that soul Alive that seeks it? Thinks your majesty There beats a heart where treason hath not turned All English blood to poison, which would feel No deadlier pang of dread more deathful to it To hear of yours endangered than to feel A sword against its own life bent, or know Death imminent as darkness overhead That takes the noon from one man's darkening eye As must your death from all this people's? You Are very England: in your light of life This living land of yours walks only safe, And all this breathing people with your breath Breathes unenslaved, and draws at each pulse in Freedom: your eye is light of theirs, your word As God's to comfort England, whose whole soul Is made with yours one, and her witness you That Rome or hell shall take not hold on her Again till God be wroth with us so much As to reclaim for heaven the star that yet Lights all your land that looks on it, and gives Assurance higher than danger dares assail Save in this lady's name and service, who Must now from you take judgment. Elizabeth. Must! by God, I know not must but as a word of mine, My tongue's and not mine ear's familiar. Sirs, Content yourselves to know this much of us, Or having known remember, that we sent The Lord of Buckhurst and our servant Beale To acquaint this queen our prisoner with the doom Confirmed on second trial against her, saying Her word can weigh not down the weightier guilt Approved upon her, and by parliament Since fortified with sentence. Yea, my lords, Ye should forget not how by message then I bade her know of me with what strong force Of strenuous and invincible argument I am urged to hold no more in such delay The process of her execution, being The seed-plot of these late conspiracies, Their author and chief motive: and am told That if I yield not mine the guilt must be In God's and in the whole world's suffering sight Of all the miseries and calamities To ensue on my refusal: whence, albeit I know not yet how God shall please to incline My heart on that behalf, I have thought it meet In conscience yet that she should be forewarned, That so she might bethink her of her sins Done both toward God offensive and to me And pray for grace to be true penitent For all these faults: which, had the main fault reached No further than mine own poor person, God Stands witness with what truth my heart protests I freely would have pardoned. She to this Makes bitter answer as of desperate heart All we may wreak our worst upon her; whom Having to death condemned, we may fulfil Our wicked work, and God in Paradise With just atonement shall requite her. This Ye see is all the pardon she will ask, Being only, and even as 'twere with prayer, desired To crave of us forgiveness: and thereon Being by Lord Buckhurst charged on this point home That by her mean the Catholics here had learnt To hold her for their sovereign, on which cause Nor my religion nor myself might live Uncharged with danger while her life should last, She answering gives God thanks aloud to be Held of so great account upon his side, And in God's cause and in the church of God's Rejoicingly makes offering of her life; Which I, God knows how unrejoicingly, Can scarce, ye tell me, choose but take, or yield At least for you to take it. Yet, being told It is not for religion she must die, But for a plot by compass of her own Laid to dethrone me and destroy, she casts Again this answer barbed with mockery back, She was not so presumptuous born, to aspire To two such ends yet ever: yea, so far She dwelt from such desire removed in heart, She would not have me suffer by her will The fillip of a finger: though herself Be persecuted even as David once And her mishap be that she cannot so Fly by the window forth as David: whence It seems she likens us to Saul, and looks Haply to see us as on Mount Gilboa fallen, Where yet, for all the shooters on her side, Our shield shall be not vilely cast away, As of one unanointed. Yet, my lords, If England might but by my death attain A state more flourishing with a better prince, Gladly would I lay down my life; who have No care save only for my people's sake To keep it: for myself, in all the world I see no great cause why for all this coil I should be fond to live or fear to die. If I should say unto you that I mean To grant not your petition, by my faith, More should I so say haply than I mean: Or should I say I mean to grant it, this Were, as I think, to tell you of my mind More than is fit for you to know: and thus I must for all petitionary prayer Deliver you an answer answerless. Yet will I pray God lighten my dark mind That being illumined it may thence foresee What for his church and all this commonwealth May most be profitable: and this once known, My hand shall halt not long behind his will. Scene II. Fotheringay. Sir Amyas Paulet and Sir Drew Drury. Paulet. I never gave God heartier thanks than these I give to have you partner of my charge Now most of all, these letters being to you No less designed than me, and you in heart One with mine own upon them. Certainly, When I put hand to pen this morning past That Master Davison by mine evidence Might note what sore disquietudes I had To increase my griefs before of body and mind, I looked for no such word to cut off mine As these to us both of Walsingham's and his. Would rather yet I had cause to still complain Of those unanswered letters two months past Than thus be certified of such intents As God best knoweth I never sought to know, Or search out secret causes: though to hear Nothing at all did breed, as I confessed, In me some hard conceits against myself, I had rather yet rest ignorant than ashamed Of such ungracious knowledge. This shall be Fruit as I think of dread wrought on the queen By those seditious rumours whose report Blows fear among the people lest our charge Escape our trust, or as they term it now Be taken away,—such apprehensive tongues So phrase it—and her freedom strike men's hearts More deep than all these flying fears that say London is fired of Papists, or the Scots Have crossed in arms the Border, or the north Is risen again rebellious, or the Guise Is disembarked in Sussex, or that now In Milford Haven rides a Spanish fleet— All which, albeit but footless floating lies, May all too easily smite and work too far Even on the heart most royal in the world That ever was a woman's. Drury. Good my friend, These noises come without a thunderbolt In such dense air of dusk expectancy As all this land lies under; nor will some Doubt or think much to say of those reports They are broached and vented of men's credulous mouths Whose ears have caught them from such lips as meant Merely to strike more terror in the queen And wring that warrant from her hovering hand Which falters yet and flutters on her lip While the hand hangs and trembles half advanced Upon that sentence which, the treasurer said, Should well ere this have spoken, seeing it was More than a full month old and four days more When he so looked to hear the word of it Which yet lies sealed of silence. Paulet. Will you say, Or any as wise and loyal, say or think It was but for a show, to scare men's wits, They have raised this hue and cry upon her flight Supposed from hence, to waken Exeter With noise from Honiton and Sampfield spread Of proclamation to detain all ships And lay all highways for her day and night, And send like precepts out four manner of ways From town to town, to make in readiness Their armour and artillery, with all speed, On pain of death, for London by report Was set on fire? though, God be therefore praised, We know this is not, yet the noise hereof Were surely not to be neglected, seeing There is, meseems, indeed no readier way To levy forces for the achieving that Which so these lewd reporters feign to fear. Drury. Why, in such mighty matters and such mists Wise men may think what hardly fools would say, And eyes get glimpse of more than sight hath leave To give commission for the babbling tongue Aloud to cry they have seen. This noise that was Upon one Arden's flight, a traitor, whence Fear flew last week all round us, gave but note How lightly may men's minds take fire, and words Take wing that have no feet to fare upon More solid than a shadow. Paulet. Nay, he was Escaped indeed: and every day thus brings Forth its new mischief: as this last month did Those treasons of the French ambassador Designed against our mistress, which God's grace Laid by the knave's mean bare to whom they sought For one to slay her, and of the Pope's hand earn Ten thousand blood-encrusted crowns a year To his most hellish hire. You will not say This too was merely fraud or vision wrought By fear or cloudy falsehood? Drury. I will say No more or surelier than I know: and this I know not thoroughly to the core of truth Or heart of falsehood in it. A man may lie Merely, or trim some bald lean truth with lies, Or patch bare falsehood with some tatter of truth, And each of these pass current: but of these Which likeliest may this man's tale be who gave Word of his own temptation by these French To hire them such a murderer, and avowed He held it godly cunning to comply And bring this envoy's secretary to sight Of one clapped up for debts in Newgate, who Being thence released might readily, as he said, Even by such means as once this lady's lord Was made away with, make the queen away With powder fired beneath her bed—why, this, Good sooth, I guess not; but I doubt the man To be more liar than fool, and yet, God wot, More fool than traitor; most of all intent To conjure coin forth of the Frenchman's purse With tricks of mere effrontery: thus at least We know did Walsingham esteem of him: And if by Davison held of more account, Or merely found more serviceable, and made A mean to tether up those quick French tongues From threat or pleading for this prisoner's life, I cannot tell, and care not. Though the queen Hath stayed this envoy's secretary from flight Forth of the kingdom, and committed him To ward within the Tower while Châteauneuf Himself should come before a council held At my lord treasurer's, where being thus accused At first he cared not to confront the man, But stood upon his office, and the charge Of his king's honour and prerogative— Then bade bring forth the knave, who being brought forth Outfaced him with insistence front to front And took the record of this whole tale's truth Upon his soul's damnation, challenging The Frenchman's answer in denial hereof, That of his own mouth had this witness been Traitorously tempted, and by personal plea Directly drawn to treason: which awhile Struck dumb the ambassador as amazed with wrath, Till presently, the accuser being removed, He made avowal this fellow some while since Had given his secretary to wit there lay One bound in Newgate who being thence released Would take the queen's death on his hand: whereto Answering, he bade the knave avoid his house On pain, if once their ways should cross, to be Sent bound before the council: who replied He had done foul wrong to take no further note, But being made privy to this damned device Keep close its perilous knowledge; whence the queen Might well complain against him; and hereon They fell to wrangling on this cause, that he Professed himself to no man answerable For declaration or for secret held Save his own master: so that now is gone Sir William Wade to Paris, not with charge To let the king there know this queen shall live, But to require the ambassador's recall And swift delivery of our traitors there To present justice: yet may no man say, For all these half-faced scares and policies, Here was more sooth than seeming. Paulet. Why, these crafts Were shameful then as fear's most shameful self, If thus your wit read them aright; and we Should for our souls and lives alike do ill To jeopard them on such men's surety given As make no more account of simple faith Than true men make of liars: and these are they, Our friends and masters, that rebuke us both By speech late uttered of her majesty For lack of zeal in service and of care She looked for at our hands, in that we have not In all this time, unprompted, of ourselves Found out some way to cut this queen's life off, Seeing how great peril, while her enemy lives, She is hourly subject unto: saying, she notes, Besides a kind of lack of love to her, Herein we have not that particular care Forsooth of our own safeties, or indeed Of the faith rather and the general good, That politic reason bids; especially, Having so strong a warrant and such ground For satisfaction of our consciences To Godward, and discharge of credit kept And reputation toward the world, as is That oath whereby we stand associated To prosecute inexorably to death Both with our joint and our particular force All by whose hand and all on whose behalf Our sovereign's life is struck at: as by proof Stands charged upon our prisoner. So they write, As though the queen's own will had warranted The words that by her will's authority Were blotted from the bond, whereby that head Was doomed on whose behoof her life should be By treason threatened: for she would not have Aught pass which grieved her subjects' consciences, She said, or might abide not openly The whole world's view: nor would she any one Were punished for another's fault: and so Cut off the plea whereon she now desires That we should dip our secret hands in blood With no direction given of her own mouth So to pursue that dangerous head to death By whose assent her life were sought: for this Stands fixed for only warrant of such deed, And this we have not, but her word instead She takes it most unkindly toward herself That men professing toward her loyally That love that we do should in any sort, For lack of our own duty's full discharge, Cast upon her the burden, knowing as we Her slowness to shed blood, much more of one So near herself in blood as is this queen, And one with her in sex and quality. And these respects, they find, or so profess, Do greatly trouble her: who hath sundry times Protested, they assure us, earnestly, That if regard of her good subjects' risk Did not more move her than the personal fear Of proper peril to her, she never would Be drawn to assent unto this bloodshedding: And so to our good judgments they refer These speeches they thought meet to acquaint us with As passed but lately from her majesty, And to God's guard commend us: which God knows We should much more need than deserve of him Should we give ear to this, and as they bid Make heretics of these papers; which three times You see how Davison hath enforced on us: But they shall taste no fire for me, nor pass Back to his hands till copies writ of them Lie safe in mine for sons of mine to keep In witness how their father dealt herein. Drury. You have done the wiselier: and what word soe'er Shall bid-them know your mind, I am well assured It well may speak for me too. Paulet. Thus it shall: That having here his letters in my hands, I would not fail, according to his charge, To send back answer with all possible speed Which shall deliver unto him my great grief And bitterness of mind, in that I am So much unhappy as I hold myself To have lived to look on this unhappy day, When I by plain direction am required From my most gracious sovereign's mouth to do An act which God forbiddeth, and the law. Hers are my goods and livings, and my life, Held at her disposition, and myself Am ready so to lose them this next day If it shall please her so, acknowledging I hold them of her mere goodwill, and do not Desire them to enjoy them but so long As her great grace gives leave: but God forbid That I should make for any grace of hers So foul a shipwreck of my conscience, or Leave ever to my poor posterity So great a blot, as privily to shed blood With neither law nor warrant. So, in trust That she, of her accustomed clemency, Will take my dutiful answer in good part, By his good mediation, as returned From one who never will be less in love, Honour, obedience, duty to his queen, Than any Christian subject living, thus To God's grace I commit him. Drury. Though I doubt She haply shall be much more wroth hereat Than lately she was gracious, when she bade God treblefold reward you for your charge So well discharged, saluting you by name Most faithful and most careful, you shall do Most like a wise man loyally to write But such good words as these, whereto myself Subscribe in heart: though being not named herein (Albeit to both seem these late letters meant) Nor this directed to me, I forbear To make particular answer. And indeed, Were danger less apparent in her life To the heart's life of all this living land, I would this woman might not die at all By secret stroke nor open sentence. Paulet. I Will praise God's mercy most for this of all, When I shall see the murderous cause removed Of its most mortal peril: nor desire A guerdon ampler from the queen we serve, Besides her commendations of my faith For spotless actions and for safe regards, Than to see judgment on her enemy done; Which were for me that recompense indeed Whereof she writes as one not given to all, But for such merit reserved to crown its claim Above all common service: nor save this Could any treasure's promise in the world So ease those travails and rejoice this heart That hers too much takes thought of, as to read Her charge to carry for her sake in it This most just thought, that she can balance not The value that her grace doth prize me at In any weight of judgment: yet it were A word to me more comfortable at heart Than these, though these most gracious, that should speak Death to her death's contriver. Drury. Nay, myself Were fain to see this coil wound up, and her Removed that makes it: yet such things will pluck Hard at men's hearts that think on them, and move Compassion that such long strange years should find So strange an end: nor shall men ever say But she was born right royal; full of sins, It may be, and by circumstance or choice Dyed and defaced with bloody stains and black, Unmerciful, unfaithful, but of heart So fiery high, so swift of spirit and clear, In extreme danger and pain so lifted up, So of all violent things inviolable, So large of courage, so superb of soul, So sheathed with iron mind invincible And arms unbreached of fireproof constancy— By shame not shaken, fear or force or death, Change, or all confluence of calamities— And so at her worst need beloved, and still, Naked of help and honour when she seemed, As other women would be, and of hope Stripped, still so of herself adorable By minds not always all ignobly mad Nor all made poisonous with false grain of faith, She shall be a world's wonder to all time, A deadly glory watched of marvelling men Not without praise, not without noble tears, And if without what she would never have Who had it never, pity—yet from none Quite without reverence and some kind of love For that which was so royal. Yea, and now That at her prayer we here attend on her, If, as I think, she have in mind to send Aught written to the queen, what we may do To further her desire shall on my part Gladly be done, so be it the grace she craves Be nought akin to danger. Paulet. It shall be The first of all then craved by her of man, Or by man's service done her, that was found So harmless ever. Enter Mary Stuart and Mary Beaton. Mary Stuart. Sirs, in time past by I was desirous many times, ye know, To have written to your queen: but since I have had Advertisement of my conviction, seeing I may not look for life, my soul is set On preparation for another world: Yet none the less, not for desire of life, But for my conscience's discharge and rest, And for my last farewell, I have at heart By you to send her a memorial writ Of somewhat that concerns myself, when I Shall presently be gone out of this world. And to remove from her, if such be there, Suspicion of all danger in receipt Of this poor paper that should come from me, Myself will take the assay of it, and so With mine own hands to yours deliver it. Paulet. Will you not also, madam, be content To seal and close it in my presence up? Mary Stuart. Sir, willingly: but I beseech your word Pledged for its safe delivery to the queen. Paulet. I plight my faith it shall be sent to her. Mary Stuart. This further promise I desire, you will Procure me from above certificate It hath been there delivered. Drury. This is more Than we may stand so pledged for: in our power It is to send, but far beyond our power, As being above our place, to promise you Certificate or warrant. Mary Stuart. Yet I trust Consideration may be had of me After my death, as one derived in blood From your queen's grandsire, with all mortal rites According with that faith I have professed All my life-days as I was born therein. This is the sum of all mine askings: whence Well might I take it in ill part of you To wish me seal my letter in your sight, Bewraying your hard opinion of me. Paulet. This Your own words well might put into my mind, That so beside my expectation made Proffer to take my first assay for me Of the outer part of it: for you must think I was not ignorant that by sleight of craft There might be as great danger so conveyed Within the letter as without, and thus I could not for ill thoughts of you be blamed, Concurring with you in this jealousy: For had yourself not moved it of yourself Sir Drew nor I had ever thought on it. Mary Stuart. The occasion why I moved it was but this, That having made my custom in time past To send sometimes some tokens to your queen, At one such time that I sent certain clothes One standing by advised her cause my gifts To be tried thoroughly ere she touched them; which I have since observed, and taken order thus With Nau, when last he tarried at the court, To do the like to a fur-fringed counterpane Which at that time I sent: and as for this, Look what great danger lies between these leaves That I dare take and handle in my hands, And press against my face each part of them Held open thus, and either deadly side, Wherein your fear smells death sown privily. Paulet. Madam, when so you charged your secretary Her majesty was far from doubt, I think, Or dream of such foul dealing: and I would Suspicion since had found no just cause given, And then things had not been as now they are. Mary Stuart. But things are as they are, and here I stand Convicted, and not knowing how many hours I have to live yet. Paulet. Madam, you shall live As many hours as God shall please: but this May be said truly, that you here have been Convicted in most honourable sort And favourable. Mary Stuart. What favour have I found? Paulet. Your cause hath been examined scrupulously By many our eldest nobles of this realm, Whereas by law you should but have been tried By twelve men as a common person. Mary Stuart. Nay, Your noblemen must by their peers be tried. Paulet. All strangers of what quality soe'er In matter of crime are only to be tried In other princes' territories by law That in that realm bears rule. Mary Stuart. You have your laws: But other princes all will think of it As they see cause; and mine own son is now No more a child, but come to man's estate, And he will think of these things bitterly. Drury. Ingratitude, whate'er he think of them, Is odious in all persons, but of all In mightiest personages most specially Most hateful: and it will not be denied But that the queen's grace greatly hath deserved Both of yourself and of your son. Mary Stuart. What boon Shall I acknowledge? Being in bonds, I am set Free from the world, and therefore am I not Afraid to speak; I have had the favour here To have been kept prisoner now these many years Against my will and justice. Paulet. Madam, this Was a great favour, and without this grace You had not lived to see these days. Mary Stuart. How so? Paulet. Seeing your own subjects did pursue you, and had The best in your own country. Mary Stuart. That is true, Because your Mildmay's ill persuasions first Made me discharge my forces, and then caused Mine enemies to burn my friends' main holds, Castles and houses. Paulet. Howsoe'er, it was By great men of that country that the queen Had earnest suit made to her to have yourself Delivered to them, which her grace denied, And to their great misliking. Drury. Seventeen years She hath kept your life to save it: and whereas She calls your highness sister, she hath dealt In truth and deed most graciously with you And sisterlike, in seeking to preserve Your life at once and honour. Mary Stuart. Ay! wherein? Drury. In that commission of your causes held At York, which was at instance of your friends Dissolved to save your honour. Mary Stuart. No: the cause Why that commission was dissolved indeed Was that my friends could not be heard to inform Against my loud accusers. Paulet. But your friend The bishop's self of Ross, your very friend, Hath written that this meeting was dismissed All only in your favour: and his book Is extant: and this favour is but one Of many graces which her majesty Hath for mere love extended to you. Mary Stuart. This Is one great favour, even to have kept me here So many years against my will. Paulet. It was For your own safety, seeing your countrymen Sought your destruction, and to that swift end Required to have you yielded up to them, As was before said. Mary Stuart. Nay, then, I will speak. I am not afraid. It was determined here That I should not depart: and when I was Demanded by my subjects, this I know, That my lord treasurer with his own close hand Writ in a packet which by trustier hands Was intercepted, and to me conveyed, To the earl of Murray, that the devil was tied Fast in a chain, and they could keep her not, But here she should be safely kept. Drury. That earl Was even as honourable a gentleman As I knew ever in that country bred. Mary Stuart. One of the worst men of the world he was: A foul adulterer, one of general lust, A spoiler and a murderer. Drury. Six weeks long, As I remember, here I saw him; where He bore him very gravely, and maintained The reputation even on all men's tongues In all things of a noble gentleman: Nor have I heard him evil spoken of Till this time ever. Mary Stuart. Yea, my rebels here Are honest men, and by the queen have been Maintained. Paulet. You greatly do forget yourself To charge her highness with so foul a fault, Which you can never find ability To prove on her. Mary Stuart. What did she with the French, I pray you, at Newhaven? Paulet. It appears You have conceived so hardly of the queen My mistress, that you still inveterately Interpret all her actions to the worst, Not knowing the truth of all the cause: but yet I dare assure you that her majesty Had most just cause and righteous, in respect As well of Calais as for other ends, To do the thing she did, and more to have done, Had it so pleased her to put forth her power: And this is in you great unthankfulness After so many favours and so great, Whereof you will acknowledge in no wise The least of any: though her majesty Hath of her own grace merely saved your life, To the utter discontentment of the best Your subjects once in open parliament Who craved against you justice on the charge Of civil law-breach and rebellion. Mary Stuart. I Know no such matter, but full well I know Sir Francis Walsingham hath openly, Since his abiding last in Scotland, said That I should rue his entertainment there. Paulet. Madam, you have not rued it, but have been More honourably entertained than ever yet Was any other crown's competitor In any realm save only this: whereof Some have been kept close prisoners, other some Maimed and unnaturally disfigured, some Murdered. Mary Stuart. But I was no competitor: All I required was in successive right To be reputed but as next the crown. Paulet. Nay, madam, you went further, when you gave The English arms and style, as though our queen Had been but an usurper on your right. Mary Stuart. My husband and my kinsmen did therein What they thought good: I had nought to do with it. Paulet. Why would you not then loyally renounce Your claim herein pretended, but with such Condition, that you might be authorized Next heir apparent to the crown? Mary Stuart. I have made At sundry times thereon good proffers, which Could never be accepted. Paulet. Heretofore It hath been proved unto you presently That in the very instant even of all Your treaties and most friendlike offers were Some dangerous crafts discovered. Mary Stuart. You must think I have some friends on earth, and if they have done Anything privily, what is that to me? Paulet. Madam, it was somewhat to you, and I would For your own sake you had forborne it, that After advertisement and conscience given Of Morgan's devilish practice, to have killed A sacred queen, you yet would entertain The murderer as your servant. Mary Stuart. I might do it With as good right as ever did your queen So entertain my rebels. Drury. Be advised: This speech is very hard, and all the case Here differs greatly. Mary Stuart. Yea, let this then be; Ye cannot yet of my conviction say But I by partial judgment was condemned, And the commissioners knew my son could have No right, were I convicted, and your queen Could have no children of her womb; whereby They might set up what man for king they would. Paulet. This is in you too great forgetfulness Of honour and yourself, to charge these lords With two so foul and horrible faults, as first To take your life by partial doom from you, And then bestow the kingdom where they liked. Mary Stuart. Well, all is one to me: and for my part I thank God I shall die without regret Of anything that I have done alive. Paulet. I would entreat you yet be sorry at least For the great wrong, and well deserving grief, You have done the queen my mistress. Mary Stuart. Nay, thereon Let others answer for themselves: I have Nothing to do with it. Have you borne in mind Those matters of my monies that we last Conferred upon together? Paulet. Madam, these Are not forgotten. Mary Stuart. Well it is if aught Be yet at all remembered for my good. Have here my letter sealed and superscribed, And so farewell—or even as here men may. [Exeunt Paulet and Drury. Had I that old strength in my weary limbs That in my heart yet fails not, fain would I Fare forth if not fare better. Tired I am, But not so lame in spirit I might not take Some comfort of the winter-wasted sun This bitter Christmas to me, though my feet Were now no firmer nor more helpful found Than when I went but in my chair abroad Last weary June at Chartley. I can stand And go now without help of either side, And bend my hand again, thou seest, to write: I did not well perchance in sight of these To have made so much of this lame hand, which yet God knows was grievous to me, and to-day To make my letter up and superscribe And seal it with no outward show of pain Before their face and inquisition; yet I care not much in player's wise piteously To blind such eyes with feigning: though this Drew Be gentler and more gracious than his mate And liker to be wrought on; but at last What need have I of men? Mary Beaton. What then you may I know not, seeing for all that was and is We are yet not at the last; but when you had, You have hardly failed to find more help of them And heartier service than more prosperous queens Exact of expectation: when your need Was greater than your name or natural state, And wage was none to look for but of death, As though the expectancy thereof and hope Were more than man's prosperities, men have given Heart's thanks to have this gift of God and you For dear life's guerdon, even the trust assured To drink for you the bitterness of death. Mary Stuart. Ay, one said once it must be—some one said I must be perilous ever, and my love More deadly than my will was evil or good Toward any of all these that through me should die— I know not who, nor when one said it: but I know too sure he lied not. Mary Beaton. No; I think This was a seer indeed. I have heard of men That under imminence of death grew strong With mortal foresight, yet in life-days past Could see no foot before them, nor provide For their own fate or fortune anything Against one angry chance of accident Or passionate fault of their own loves or hates That might to death betray them: such an one Thus haply might have prophesied, and had No strength to save himself. Mary Stuart. I know not: yet Time was when I remembered. Mary Beaton. It should be No enemy's saying whom you remember not; You are wont not to forget your enemies; yet The word rang sadder than a friend's should fall Save in some strange pass of the spirit or flesh For love's sake haply hurt to death. Mary Stuart. It seems Thy mind is bent to know the name of me That of myself I know not. Mary Beaton. Nay, my mind Has other thoughts to beat upon: for me It may suffice to know the saying for true And never care who said it. Mary Stuart. True? too sure, God to mine heart's grief hath approved it. See, Nor Scot nor Englishman that takes on him The service of my sorrow but partakes The sorrow of my service: man by man, As that one said, they perish of me: yea, Were I a sword sent upon earth, or plague Bred of aerial poison, I could be No deadlier where unwillingly I strike, Who where I would can hurt not: Percy died By his own hand in prison, Howard by law, These young men with strange torments done to death, Who should have rid me and the world of her That is our scourge, and to the church of God A pestilence that wastes it: all the north Wears yet the scars engraven of civil steel Since its last rising: nay, she saith but right, Mine enemy, saying by these her servile tongues I have brought upon her land mine own land's curse, And a sword follows at my heel, and fire Is kindled of mine eyeshot: and before, Whom did I love that died not of it? whom That I would save might I deliver, when I had once but looked on him with love, or pledged Friendship? I should have died I think long since, That many might have died not, and this word Had not been written of me nor fulfilled, But perished in the saying, a prophecy That took the prophet by the throat and slew— As sure I think it slew him. Such a song Might my poor servant slain before my face Have sung before the stroke of violent death Had fallen upon him there for my sake. Mary Beaton. Ah! You think so? this remembrance was it not That hung and hovered in your mind but now, Moved your heart backward all unwittingly To some blind memory of the man long dead? Mary Stuart. In sooth, I think my prophet should have been David. Mary Beaton. You thought of him? Mary Stuart. An old sad thought: The moan of it was made long since, and he Not unremembered. Mary Beaton. Nay, of him indeed Record was made—a royal record: whence No marvel is it that you forgot not him. Mary Stuart. I would forget no friends nor enemies: these More needs me now remember. Think'st thou not This woman hates me deadlier—or this queen That is not woman—than myself could hate Except I were as she in all things? then I should love no such woman as am I Much more than she may love me: yet I am sure, Or so near surety as all belief may be, She dare not slay me for her soul's sake: nay, Though that were made as light of as a leaf Storm-shaken, in such stormy winds of state As blow between us like a blast of death, For her throne's sake she durst not, which must be Broken to build my scaffold. Yet, God wot, Perchance a straw's weight now cast in by chance Might weigh my life down in the scale her hand Holds hardly straight for trembling: if she be Woman at all, so tempered naturally And with such spirit and sense as thou and I, Should I for wrath so far forget myself As these men sometime charge me that I do, My tongue might strike my head off. By this head That yet I wear to swear by, if life be Thankworthy, God might well be thanked for this Of me or whoso loves me in the world, That I spake never half my heart out yet, For any sore temptation of them all, To her or hers; nor ever put but once My heart upon my paper, writing plain The things I thought, heard, knew for truth of her, Believed or feigned—nay, feigned not to believe Of her fierce follies fed with wry-mouthed praise, And that vain ravin of her sexless lust Which could not feed nor hide its hunger, curb With patience nor allay with love the thirst That mocked itself as all mouths mocked it. Ha, What might the reading of these truths have wrought Within her maiden mind, what seed have sown, Trow'st thou, in her sweet spirit, of revenge Toward me that showed her queenship in the glass A subject's hand of hers had put in mine The likeness of it loathed and laughable As they that worshipped it with words and signs Beheld her and bemocked her? Mary Beaton. Certainly, I think that soul drew never breath alive To whom this letter might seem pardonable Which timely you forbore to send her. Mary Stuart. Nay, I doubt not I did well to keep it back— And did not ill to write it: for God knows It was no small ease to my heart. Mary Beaton. But say I had not burnt it as you bade me burn, But kept it privily safe against a need That I might haply sometime have of it? Mary Stuart. What, to destroy me? Mary Beaton. Hardly, sure, to save. Mary Stuart. Why shouldst thou think to bring me to my death? Mary Beaton. Indeed, no man am I that love you; nor Need I go therefore in such fear of you As of my mortal danger. Mary Stuart. On my life, (Long life or short, with gentle or violent end, I know not, and would choose not, though I might So take God's office on me) one that heard Would swear thy speech had in it, and subtly mixed, A savour as of menace, or a sound As of an imminent ill or perilous sense Which was not in thy meaning. Mary Beaton. No: in mine There lurked no treason ever; nor have you Cause to think worse of me than loyally, If proof may be believed on witness. Mary Stuart. Sure, I think I have not nor I should not have: Thy life has been the shadow cast of mine, A present faith to serve my present need, A foot behind my footsteps; as long since In those French dances that we trod, and laughed The blithe way through together. Thou couldst sing Then, and a great while gone it is by this Since I heard song or music: I could now Find in my heart to bid thee, as the Jews Were once bid sing in their captivity One of their songs of Sion, sing me now, If one thou knowest, for love of that far time, One of our songs of Paris. Mary Beaton. Give me leave A little to cast up some wandering words And gather back such memories as may beat About my mind of such a song, and yet I think I might renew some note long dumb That once your ear allowed of.—I did pray, [Aside. Tempt me not, God: and by her mouth again He tempts me—nay, but prompts me, being most just, To know by trial if all remembrance be Dead as remorse or pity that in birth Died, and were childless in her: if she quite Forget that very swan-song of thy love, My love that wast, my love that wouldst not be, Let God forget her now at last as I Remember: if she think but one soft thought, Cast one poor word upon thee, God thereby Shall surely bid me let her live: if none, I shoot that letter home and sting her dead. God strengthen me to sing but these words through Though I fall dumb at end for ever. Now— [She sings. Apreès tant de jours, après tant de pleurs, Soyez secourable à mon âme en peine. Voyez comme Avril fait l'amour aux fleurs; Dame d'amour, dame aux belles couleurs, Dieu vous a fait belle, Amour vous fait reine. Rions, je t'en prie; aimons, je le veux. Le temps fuit et rit et ne revient guère Pour baiser le bout de tes blonds cheveux, Pour baiser tes cils, ta bouche et tes yeux; L'amour n'a qu'un jour auprès de sa mère. Mary Stuart. Nay, I should once have known that song, thou say'st, And him that sang it and should now be dead: Was it—but his rang sweeter—was it not Remy Belleau? Mary Beaton. (My letter—here at heart!) [Aside. I think it might be—were it better writ And courtlier phrased, with Latin spice cast in, And a more tunable descant. Mary Stuart. Ay; how sweet Sang all the world about those stars that sang With Ronsard for the strong mid star of all, His bay-bound head all glorious with grey hairs, Who sang my birth and bridal! When I think Of those French years, I only seem to see A light of swords and singing, only hear Laughter of love and lovely stress of lutes, And in between the passion of them borne Sound of swords crossing ever, as of feet Dancing, and life and death still equally Blithe and bright-eyed from battle. Haply now My sometime sister, mad Queen Madge, is grown As grave as I should be, and wears at waist No hearts of last year's lovers any more Enchased for jewels round her girdlestead, But rather beads for penitence; yet I doubt Time should not more abash her heart than mine, Who live not heartless yet. These days like those Have power but for a season given to do No more upon our spirits than they may, And what they may we know not till it be Done, and we need no more take thought of it, As I no more of death or life to-day. Mary Beaton. That shall you surely need not. Mary Stuart. So I think, Our keepers being departed: and by these, Even by the uncourtlier as the gentler man, I read as in a glass their queen's plain heart, And that by her at last I shall not die. Scene III. Greenwich Palace. Queen Elizabeth and Davison. Elizabeth. Thou hast seen Lord Howard? I bade him send thee. Davison. Madam, But now he came upon me hard at hand And by your gracious message bade me in. Elizabeth. The day is fair as April: hast thou been Abroad this morning? 'Tis no winter's sun That makes these trees forget their nakedness And all the glittering ground, as 'twere in hope, Breathe laughingly. Davison. Indeed, the gracious air Had drawn me forth into the park, and thence Comes my best speed to attend upon your grace. Elizabeth. My grace is not so gracious as the sun That graces thus the late distempered air: And you should oftener use to walk abroad, Sir, than your custom is: I would not have Good servants heedless of their natural health To do me sickly service. It were strange That one twice bound as woman and as queen To care for good men's lives and loyalties Should prove herself toward either dangerous. Davison. That Can be no part of any servant's fear Who lives for service of your majesty. Elizabeth. I would not have it be—God else forbid— Who have so loyal servants as I hold All now that bide about me: for I will not Think, though such villainy once were in men's minds, That twice among mine English gentlemen Shall hearts be found so foul as theirs who thought, When I was horsed for hunting, to waylay And shoot me through the back at unawares With poisoned bullets: nor, thou knowest, would I, When this was opened to me, take such care, Ride so fenced round about with iron guard, Or walk so warily as men counselled me For loyal fear of what thereafter might More prosperously be plotted: nay, God knows, I would not hold on such poor terms my life, With such a charge upon it, as to breathe In dread of death or treason till the day That they should stop my trembling breath, and ease The piteous heart that panted like a slave's Of all vile fear for ever. So to live Were so much hatefuller than thus to die, I do not think that man or woman draws Base breath of life the loathsomest on earth Who by such purchase of perpetual fear And deathless doubt of all in trust of none Would shudderingly prolong it. Davison. Even too well Your servants know that greatness of your heart Which gives you yet unguarded to men's eyes, And were unworthier found to serve or live Than is the unworthiest of them, did not this Make all their own hearts hotter with desire To be the bulwark or the price of yours Paid to redeem it from the arrest of death. Elizabeth. So haply should they be whose hearts beat true With loyal blood: but whoso says they are Is but a loving liar. Davison. I trust your grace Hath in your own heart no such doubt of them As speaks in mockery through your lips. Elizabeth. By God, I say much less than righteous truth might speak Of their loud loves that ring with emptiness, And hollow-throated loyalties whose heart Is wind and clamorous promise. Ye desire, With all your souls ye swear that ye desire The queen of Scots were happily removed, And not a knave that loves me will put hand To the enterprise ye look for only of me Who only would forbear it. Davison. If your grace Be minded yet it shall be done at all, The way that were most honourable and just Were safest, sure, and best. Elizabeth. I dreamt last night Our murderess there in hold had tasted death By execution of the sentence done That was pronounced upon her; and the news So stung my heart with wrath to hear of it That had I had a sword—look to't, and 'ware!— I had thrust it through thy body. Davison. God defend! 'Twas well I came not in your highness' way While the hot mood was on you. But indeed I would know soothly if your mind be changed From its late root of purpose. Elizabeth. No, by God: But I were fain it could be somewise done And leave the blame not on me. And so much, If there were love and honesty in one Whom I held faithful and exact of care, Should easily be performed; but here I find This dainty fellow so precise a knave As will take all things dangerous on his tongue And nothing on his hand: hot-mouthed and large In zeal to stuff mine ears with promises, But perjurous in performance: did he not Set hand among you to the bond whereby He is bound at utmost hazard of his life To do me such a service? Yet I could Have wrought as well without him, had I wist Of this faint falsehood in his heart: there is That Wingfield whom thou wot'st of, would have done With glad goodwill what I required of him, And made no Puritan mouths on't. Davison. Madam, yet Far better were it all should but be done By line of law and judgment. Elizabeth. There be men Wiser than thou that see this otherwise. Davison. All is not wisdom that of wise men comes, Nor are all eyes that search the ways of state Clear as a just man's conscience. Elizabeth. Proverbs! ha? Who made thee master of these sentences, Prime tongue of ethics and philosophy? Davison. An honest heart to serve your majesty; Nought else nor subtler in its reach of wit Than very simpleness of meaning. Elizabeth. Nay, I do believe thee; heartily I do. Did my lord admiral not desire thee bring The warrant for her execution? Davison. Ay, Madam; here is it. Elizabeth. I would it might not be, Or being so just were yet not necessary. Art thou not heartily sorry—wouldst thou not, I say, be sad—to see me sign it? Davison. Madam, I grieve at any soul's mishap that lives, And specially for shipwreck of a life To you so near allied: but seeing this doom Wrung forth from justice by necessity, I had rather guilt should bleed than innocence. Elizabeth. When I shall sign, take thou this instantly To the lord chancellor; see it straight be sealed As quietly as he may, not saying a word, That no man come to know it untimely: then Send it to the earls of Kent and Shrewsbury Who are here set down to see this justice done: I would no more be troubled with this coil Till all be through. But, for the place of doom, The hall there of the castle, in my mind, Were fitter than the court or open green. And as thou goest betake thee on thy way To Walsingham, where he lies sick at home, And let him know what hath of us been done: Whereof the grief, I fear me, shall go near To kill his heart outright. Davison. Your majesty Hath yet not signed the warrant. Elizabeth. Ha! God's blood! Art thou from tutor of philosophy late Grown counsellor too and more than counsellor, thou To appoint me where and what this hand of mine Shall at thy beck obsequiously subscribe And follow on thy finger? By God's death, What if it please me now not sign at all? This letter of my kinswoman's last writ Hath more compulsion in it, and more power To enforce my pity, than a thousand tongues Dictating death against her in mine ear Of mine own vassal subjects. Here but now She writes me she thanks God with all her heart That it hath pleased him by the mean of me To make an end of her life's pilgrimage, Which hath been weary to her: and doth not ask To see its length drawn longer, having had Too much experience of its bitterness: But only doth entreat me, since she may Look for no favour at their zealous hands Who are first in councils of my ministry, That only I myself will grant her prayers; Whereof the first is, since she cannot hope For English burial with such Catholic rites As here were used in time of the ancient kings, Mine ancestors and hers, and since the tombs Lie violated in Scotland of her sires, That so soon ever as her enemies Shall with her innocent blood be satiated, Her body by her servants may be borne To some ground consecrated, there to be Interred: and rather, she desires, in France, Where sleep her honoured mother's ashes; so At length may her poor body find the rest Which living it has never known: thereto, She prays me, from the fears she hath of those To whose harsh hand I have abandoned her, She may not secretly be done to death, But in her servants' sight and others', who May witness her obedience kept and faith To the true church, and guard her memory safe From slanders haply to be blown abroad Concerning her by mouths of enemies: last, She asks that her attendants, who so well And faithfully through all her miseries past Have served her, may go freely where they please, And lose not those small legacies of hers Which poverty can yet bequeath to them. This she conjures me by the blood of Christ, Our kinship, and my grandsire's memory, Who was her father's grandsire and a king, And by the name of queen she bears with her Even to the death, that I will not refuse, And that a word in mine own hand may thus Assure her, who will then as she hath lived Die mine affectionate sister and prisoner. See, Howe'er she have sinned, what heart were mine, if this Drew no tears from me: not the meanest soul That lives most miserable but with such words Must needs draw down men's pity. Davison. Sure it is, This queen hath skill of writing: and her hand Hath manifold eloquence with various voice To express discourse of sirens or of snakes, A mermaid's or a monster's, uttering best All music or all malice. Here is come A letter writ long since of hers to you From Sheffield Castle, which for shame or fear She durst not or she would not thence despatch, Sent secretly to me from Fotheringay, Not from her hand, but with her own hand writ, So foul of import and malignity I durst not for your majesty's respect With its fierce infamies afire from hell Offend your gracious eyesight: but because Your justice by your mercy's ignorant hand Hath her fair eyes put out, and walks now blind Even by the pit's edge deathward, pardon me If what you never should have seen be shown By hands that rather would take fire in hand Than lay in yours this writing. [Gives her a letter. Elizabeth. By this light, Whate'er be here, thou hadst done presumptuously, And Walsingham thy principal, to keep Aught from mine eyes that being to me designed Might even with most offence enlighten them. Here is her hand indeed; and she takes up [Reading. In gracious wise enough the charge imposed By promise on her and desire of ours, How loth soe'er she be, regretfully To bring such things in question of discourse, Yet with no passion but sincerity, As God shall witness her, declares to us What our good lady of Shrewsbury said to her Touching ourself in terms ensuing; whereto Answering she chid this dame for such belief, And reprehended for licentious tongue, To speak so lewdly of us: which herself Believes not, knowing the woman's natural heart And evil will as then to usward. Here She writes no more than I would well believe Of her as of the countess. Ha! Davison. Your grace Shall but defile and vex your eyes and heart To read these villainies through. Elizabeth. God's death, man! peace: Thou wert not best incense me toward thine own, Whose eyes have been before me in them. What! Was she not mad to write this? One that had Your promise—lay with you times numberless— All license and all privateness that may Be used of wife and husband! yea, of her And more dead men than shame remembers. God Shall stand her witness—with the devil of hell For sponsor to her vows, whose spirit in her Begot himself this issue. Ha, the duke! —Nay, God shall give me patience—and his knave, And Hatton—God have mercy! nay, but hate, Hate and constraint and rage have wrecked her wits, And continence of life cut off from lust, —This common stale of Scotland, that has tried The sins of three rank nations, and consumed Their veins whose life she took not—Italy, France that put half this poison in her blood, And her own kingdom that being sick therewith Vomited out on ours the venomous thing Whose head we set not foot on—but may God Make my fame fouler through the world than hers And ranker in men's record, if I spare The she-wolf that I saved, the woman-beast, Wolf-woman—how the Latin rings we know, And what lewd lair first reared her, and whose hand Writ broad across the Louvre and Holyrood Lupanar—but no brothel ever bred Or breathed so rank a soul's infection, spawned Or spat such foulness in God's face and man's Or festered in such falsehood as her breath Strikes honour sick with, and the spirit of shame Dead as her fang shall strike herself, and send The serpent that corruption calls her soul To vie strange venoms with the worm of hell And make the face of darkness and the grave Blush hotter with the fires wherein that soul Sinks deeper than damnation. Davison. Let your grace Think only that but now the thing is known And self-discovered which too long your love Too dangerously hath cherished; and forget All but that end which yet remains for her, That right by pity be not overcome. Elizabeth. God pity so my soul as I do right, And show me no more grace alive or dead Than I do justice here. Give me again That warrant I put by, being foolish: yea, Thy word spake sooth—my soul's eyes were put out— I could not see for pity. Thou didst well— I am bounden to thee heartily—to cure My sight of this distemper, and my soul. Here in God's sight I set mine hand, who thought Never to take this thing upon it, nor Do God so bitter service. Take this hence: And let me see no word nor hear of her Till the sun see not such a soul alive. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. MARY STUART. Scene I. Mary's Chamber in Fotheringay Castle. Mary Stuart and Mary Beaton. Mary Stuart (sings). O Lord my God, I have trusted in thee; O Jesu my dearest one, Now set me free. In prison's oppression, In sorrow's obsession, I weary for thee. With sighing and crying Bowed down as dying, I adore thee, I implore thee, set me free! Free are the dead: yet fain I would have had Once, before all captivity find end, Some breath of freedom living. These that come, I think, with no such message, must not find, For all this lameness of my limbs, a heart As maimed in me with sickness. Three years gone, When last I parted from the earl marshal's charge, I did not think to see his face again Turned on me as his prisoner. Now his wife Will take no jealousy more to hear of it, I trust, albeit we meet not as unfriends, If it be mortal news he brings me. Go, If I seem ready, as meseems I should, And well arrayed to bear myself indeed None otherwise than queenlike in their sight, Bid them come in. [Exit Mary Beaton. I cannot tell at last If it be fear or hope that should expect Death; I have had enough of hope, and fear Was none of my familiars while I lived Such life as had more pleasant things to lose Than death or life may now divide me from. 'Tis not so much to look upon the sun With eyes that may not lead us where we will, And halt behind the footless flight of hope With feet that may not follow: nor were aught So much, of all things life may think to have, That one not cowardly born should find it worth The purchase of so base a price as this, To stand self-shamed as coward. I do not think This is mine end that comes upon me: but I had liefer far it were than, were it not, That ever I should fear it. Enter Kent, Shrewsbury, Beale, and Sheriff. Sirs, good day: With such good heart as prisoners have, I bid You and your message welcome. Kent. Madam, this The secretary of the council here hath charge To read as their commission. Mary Stuart. Let me hear In as brief wise as may beseem the time The purport of it. Beale. Our commission here Given by the council under the great seal Pronounces on your head for present doom Death, by this written sentence. Mary Stuart. Ay, my lords? May I believe this, and not hold myself Mocked as a child with shadows? In God's name, Speak you, my lord of Shrewsbury: let me know If this be dream or waking. Kent. Verily, No dream it is, nor dreamers we that pray, Madam, you meetly would prepare yourself To stand before God's judgment presently. Mary Stuart. I had rather so than ever stand again Before the face of man's. Why speak not you, To whom I speak, my lord earl marshal? Nay, Look not so heavily: by my life, he stands As one at point to weep. Why, good my lord, To know that none may swear by Mary's life And hope again to find belief of man Upon so slight a warrant, should not bring This trouble on your eyes; look up, and say The word you have for her that never was Less than your friend, and prisoner. Shrewsbury. None save this, Which willingly I would not speak, I may; That presently your time is come to die. Mary Stuart. Why, then, I am well content to leave a world Wherein I am no more serviceable at all To God or man, and have therein so long Endured so much affliction. All my life I have ever earnestly desired the love And friendship of your queen; have warned her oft Of coming dangers; and have cherished long The wish that I but once might speak with her In plain-souled confidence; being well assured, Had we but once met, there an end had been Of jealousies between us: but our foes, With equal wrong toward either, treacherously Have kept us still in sunder: by whose craft And crooked policy hath my sister's crown Fallen in great peril, and myself have been Imprisoned, and inveterately maligned, And here must now be murdered. But I know That only for my faith's sake I must die, And this to know for truth is recompense As large as all my sufferings. For the crime Wherewith I am charged, upon this holy book I lay mine hand for witness of my plea, I am wholly ignorant of it; and solemnly Declare that never yet conspiracy Devised against the queen my sister's life Took instigation or assent from me. Kent. You swear but on a popish Testament: Such oaths are all as worthless as the book. Mary Stuart. I swear upon the book wherein I trust: Would you give rather credit to mine oath Sworn on your scriptures that I trust not in? Kent. Madam, I fain would have you heartily Renounce your superstition; toward which end With us the godly dean of Peterborough, Good Richard Fletcher, well approved for faith Of God and of the queen, is hither come To proffer you his prayerful ministry. Mary Stuart. If you, my lords, or he will pray for me, I shall be thankful for your prayers; but may not With theirs that hold another faith mix mine. I pray you therefore that mine almoner may Have leave to attend on me, that from his hands I, having made confession, may receive The sacrament. Kent. We may not grant you this. Mary Stuart. I shall not see my chaplain ere I die? But two months gone this grace was granted me By word expressly from your queen, to have Again his ministration: and at last In the utter hour and bitter strait of death Is this denied me? Kent. Madam, for your soul More meet it were to cast these mummeries out, And bear Christ only in your heart, than serve With ceremonies of ritual hand and tongue His mere idolatrous likeness. Mary Stuart. This were strange, That I should bear him visible in my hand Or keep with lips and knees his titular rites And cast in heart no thought upon him. Nay, Put me, I pray, to no more argument: But if this least thing be not granted, yet Grant me to know the season of my death. Shrewsbury. At eight by dawn to-morrow you must die. Mary Stuart. So shall I hardly see the sun again. By dawn to-morrow? meanest men condemned Give not their lives' breath up so suddenly: Howbeit, I had rather yield you thanks, who make Such brief end of the bitterness of death For me who have borne such bitter length of life, Than plead with protestation of appeal For half a piteous hour's remission: nor Henceforward shall I be denied of man Aught, who may never now crave aught again But whence is no denial. Yet shall this Not easily be believed of men, nor find In foreign ears acceptance, that a queen Should be thrust out of life thus. Good my friend, Bid my physician Gorion come to me: I have to speak with him—sirs, with your leave— Of certain monies due to me in France. What, shall I twice desire your leave, my lords, To live these poor last hours of mine alive At peace among my friends? I have much to do, And little time wherein to do it is left. Shrewsbury (to Kent apart). I pray she may not mean worse than I would Against herself ere morning. Kent. Let not then This French knave's drugs come near her, nor himself: We will take order for it. Shrewsbury. Nay, this were but To exasperate more her thwarted heart, and make Despair more desperate than itself. Pray God She be not minded to compel us put Force at the last upon her of men's hands To hale her violently to death, and make Judgment look foul and fierce as murder's face With stain of strife and passion. [Exeunt all but Mary Stuart and Mary Beaton. Mary Stuart. So, my friend, The last of all our Maries are you left To-morrow. Strange has been my life, and now Strange looks my death upon me: yet, albeit Nor the hour nor manner of it be mine to choose, Ours is it yet, and all men's in the world, To make death welcome in what wise we will. Bid you my chaplain, though he see me not, Watch through the night and pray for me: perchance, When ere the sundawn they shall bring me forth, I may behold him, and upon my knees Receive his blessing. Let our supper be Served earlier in than wont was: whereunto I bid my true poor servants here, to take Farewell and drink at parting to them all The cup of my last kindness, in good hope They shall stand alway constant in their faith And dwell in peace together: thereupon What little store is left me will I share Among them, and between my girls divide My wardrobe and my jewels severally, Reserving but the black robe and the red That shall attire me for my death: and last With mine own hand shall be my will writ out And all memorials more set down therein That I would leave for legacies of love To my next kinsmen and my household folk. And to the king my brother yet of France Must I write briefly, but a word to say I am innocent of the charge whereon I die Now for my right's sake claimed upon this crown, And our true faith's sake, but am barred from sight Even of mine almoner here, though hard at hand; And I would bid him take upon his charge The keeping of my servants, as I think He shall not for compassionate shame refuse, Albeit his life be softer than his heart; And in religion for a queen's soul pray That once was styled Most Christian, and is now In the true faith about to die, deprived Of all her past possessions. But this most And first behoves it, that the king of Spain By Gorion's word of mouth receive my heart, Who soon shall stand before him. Bid the leech Come hither, and alone, to speak with me. [Exit Mary Beaton. She is dumb as death: yet never in her life Hath she been quick of tongue. For all the rest, Poor souls, how well they love me, all as well I think I know: and one of them or twain At least may surely see me to my death Ere twice the hours have changed again. Perchance Love that can weep not would the gladlier die For those it cannot weep on. Time wears thin: They should not now play laggard: nay, he comes, The last that ever speaks alone with me Before my soul shall speak alone with God. Enter Gorion. I have sent once more for you to no such end As sick men for physicians: no strong drug May put the death next morning twelve hours back Whose twilight overshadows me, that am Nor sick nor medicinable. Let me know If I may lay the last of all my trust On you that ever shall be laid on man To prove him kind and loyal. Gorion. So may God Deal with me, madam, as I prove to you Faithful, though none but I were in the world That you might trust beside. Mary Stuart. With equal heart Do I believe and thank you. I would send To Paris for the ambassador from Spain This letter with two diamonds, which your craft For me must cover from men's thievish eyes Where they may be not looked for. Gorion. Easily Within some molten drug may these be hid, And faithfully by me conveyed to him. Mary Stuart. The lesser of them shall he keep in sign Of my good friendship toward himself: but this In token to King Philip shall he give That for the truth I die, and dying commend To him my friends and servants, Gilbert Curle, His sister, and Jane Kennedy, who shall To-night watch by me; and my ladies all That have endured my prison: let him not Forget from his good favour one of these That I remember to him: Charles Arundel, And either banished Paget; one whose heart Was better toward my service than his hand, Morgan: and of mine exiles for their faith, The prelates first of Glasgow and of Ross; And Liggons and Throgmorton, that have lost For me their leave to live on English earth; And Westmoreland, that lives now more forlorn Than died that earl who rose for me with him. These I beseech him favour for my sake Still: and forget not, if he come again To rule as king in England, one of them That were mine enemies here: the treasurer first, And Leicester, Walsingham, and Huntingdon, At Tutbury once my foe, fifteen years gone, And Wade that spied upon me three years since, And Paulet here my gaoler: set them down For him to wreak wrath's utmost justice on, In my revenge remembered. Though I be Dead, let him not forsake his hope to reign Upon this people: with my last breath left I make this last prayer to him, that not the less He will maintain the invasion yet designed Of us before on England: let him think, It is God's quarrel, and on earth a cause Well worthy of his greatness: which being won, Let him forget no man of these nor me. And now will I lie down, that four hours' sleep May give me strength before I sleep again And need take never thought for waking more. Scene II. The Presence Chamber. Shrewsbury, Kent, Paulet, Drury, Melville, and Attendants. Kent. The stroke is past of eight. Shrewsbury. Not far, my lord. Kent. What stays the provost and the sheriff yet That went ere this to bring the prisoner forth? What, are her doors locked inwards? then perchance Our last night's auguries of some close design By death contrived of her self-slaughterous hand To baffle death by justice hit but right The heart of her bad purpose. Shrewsbury. Fear it not: See where she comes, a queenlier thing to see Than whom such thoughts take hold on. Enter Mary Stuart, led by two gentlemen and preceded by the Sheriff; Mary Beaton, Barbara Mowbray, and other ladies behind, who remain in the doorway. Melville (kneeling to Mary). Woe am I, Madam, that I must bear to Scotland back Such tidings watered with such tears as these. Mary Stuart. Weep not, good Melville: rather should your heart Rejoice that here an end is come at last Of Mary Stuart's long sorrows; for be sure That all this world is only vanity. And this record I pray you make of me, That a true woman to my faith I die, And true to Scotland and to France: but God Forgive them that have long desired mine end And with false tongues have thirsted for my blood As the hart thirsteth for the water-brooks. O God, who art truth, and the author of all truth, Thou knowest the extreme recesses of my heart, And how that I was willing all my days That England should with Scotland be fast friends. Commend me to my son: tell him that I Have nothing done to prejudice his rights As king: and now, good Melville, fare thee well. My lord of Kent, whence comes it that your charge Hath bidden back my women there at door Who fain to the end would bear me company? Kent. Madam, this were not seemly nor discreet, That these should so have leave to vex men's ears With cries and loose lamentings: haply too They might in superstition seek to dip Their handkerchiefs for relics in your blood. Mary Stuart. That will I pledge my word they shall not. Nay, The queen would surely not deny me this, The poor last thing that I shall ask on earth. Even a far meaner person dying I think She would not have so handled. Sir, you know I am her cousin, of her grandsire's blood, A queen of France by marriage, and by birth Anointed queen of Scotland. My poor girls Desire no more than but to see me die. Shrewsbury. Madam, you have leave to elect of this your train Two ladies with four men to go with you. Mary Stuart. I choose from forth my Scottish following here Jane Kennedy, with Elspeth Curle: of men, Bourgoin and Gorion shall attend on me, Gervais and Didier. Come then, let us go. [Exeunt: manent Mary Beaton and Barbara Mowbray. Barbara. I wist I was not worthy, though my child It is that her own hands made Christian: but I deemed she should have bid you go with her. Alas, and would not all we die with her? Mary Beaton. Why, from the gallery here at hand your eyes May go with her along the hall beneath Even to the scaffold: and I fain would hear What fain I would not look on. Pray you, then, If you may bear to see it as those below, Do me that sad good service of your eyes For mine to look upon it, and declare All that till all be done I will not see; I pray you of your pity. Barbara. Though mine heart Break, it shall not for fear forsake the sight That may be faithful yet in following her, Nor yet for grief refuse your prayer, being fain To give your love such bitter comfort, who So long have never left her. Mary Beaton. Till she die— I have ever known I shall not till she die. See you yet aught? if I hear spoken words, My heart can better bear these pulses, else Unbearable, that rend it. Barbara. Yea, I see Stand in mid hall the scaffold, black as death, And black the block upon it: all around, Against the throng a guard of halberdiers; And the axe against the scaffold-rail reclined, And two men masked on either hand beyond: And hard behind the block a cushion set, Black, as the chair behind it. Mary Beaton. When I saw Fallen on a scaffold once a young man's head, Such things as these I saw not. Nay, but on: I knew not that I spake: and toward your ears Indeed I spake not. Barbara. All those faces change; She comes more royally than ever yet Fell foot of man triumphant on this earth, Imperial more than empire made her, born Enthroned as queen sat never. Not a line Stirs of her sovereign feature: like a bride Brought home she mounts the scaffold; and her eyes Sweep regal round the cirque beneath, and rest, Subsiding with a smile. She sits, and they, The doomsmen earls, beside her; at her left The sheriff, and the clerk at hand on high, To read the warrant. Mary Beaton. None stands there but knows What things therein are writ against her: God Knows what therein is writ not. God forgive All. Barbara. Not a face there breathes of all the throng But is more moved than hers to hear this read, Whose look alone is changed not. Mary Beaton. Once I knew A face that changed not in as dire an hour More than the queen's face changes. Hath he not Ended? Barbara. You cannot hear them speak below: Come near and hearken; bid not me repeat All. Mary Beaton. I beseech you—for I may not come. Barbara. Now speaks Lord Shrewsbury but a word or twain, And brieflier yet she answers, and stands up As though to kneel, and pray. Mary Beaton. I too have prayed— God hear at last her prayers not less than mine, Which failed not, sure, of hearing. Barbara. Now draws nigh That heretic priest, and bows himself, and thrice Strives, as a man that sleeps in pain, to speak, Stammering: she waves him by, as one whose prayers She knows may nought avail her: now she kneels, And the earls rebuke her, and she answers not, Kneeling. O Christ, whose likeness there engraved She strikes against her bosom, hear her! Now That priest lifts up his voice against her prayer, Praying: and a voice all round goes up with his: But hers is lift up higher than climbs their cry, In the great psalms of penitence: and now She prays aloud in English; for the Pope Our father, and his church; and for her son, And for the queen her murderess; and that God May turn from England yet his wrath away; And so forgives her enemies; and implores High intercession of the saints with Christ, Whom crucified she kisses on his cross, And crossing now her breast—Ah, heard you not? Even as thine arms were spread upon the cross, So make thy grace, O Jesus, wide for me, Receive me to thy mercy so, and so Forgive my sins. Mary Beaton. So be it, if so God please. Is she not risen up yet? Barbara. Yea, but mine eyes Darken: because those deadly twain close masked Draw nigh as men that crave forgiveness, which Gently she grants: for now, she said, I hope You shall end all my troubles. Now meseems They would put hand upon her as to help, And disarray her raiment: but she smiles— Heard you not that? can you nor hear nor speak, Poor heart, for pain? Truly, she said, my lords, I never had such chamber-grooms before As these to wait on me. Mary Beaton. An end, an end. Barbara. Now come those twain upon the scaffold up Whom she preferred before us: and she lays Her crucifix down, which now the headsman takes Into his cursed hand, but being rebuked Puts back for shame that sacred spoil of hers. And now they lift her veil up from her head Softly, and softly draw the black robe off, And all in red as of a funeral flame She stands up statelier yet before them, tall And clothed as if with sunset: and she takes From Elspeth's hand the crimson sleeves, and draws Their covering on her arms: and now those twain Burst out aloud in weeping: and she speaks— Weep not; I promised for you. Now she kneels; And Jane binds round a kerchief on her eyes: And smiling last her heavenliest smile on earth, She waves a blind hand toward them, with Farewell, Farewell, to meet again: and they come down And leave her praying aloud, In thee, O Lord, I put my trust: and now, that psalm being through, She lays between the block and her soft neck Her long white peerless hands up tenderly, Which now the headsman draws again away, But softly too: now stir her lips again— Into thine hands, O Lord, into thine hands, Lord, I commend my spirit: and now—but now, Look you, not I, the last upon her. Mary Beaton. Ha! He strikes awry: she stirs not. Nay, but now He strikes aright, and ends it. Barbara. Hark, a cry. Voice below. So perish all found enemies of the queen! Another Voice. Amen. Mary Beaton. I heard that very cry go up Far off long since to God, who answers here. THE END.</field>
