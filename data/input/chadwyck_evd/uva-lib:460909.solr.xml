      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene.—A rugged mountain pass—at the back a practicable path from the stage winds up the mountain. Entrance to a cavern R. Stool R. Trees on the mountain. Barbavano, Domino, and other Brigands discovered. —Horn sounded. Dom. The horn on yonder mountain has loudly sounded thrice! Assemble, comrades, come! gather round, gather round in a trice. Five or six Brigands enter R. and L. Bar. (crossing R.) Who goes there? Voices (without) Brigands, all! brigands, all! Bar. The countersign deliver! Dom. The watchword, quickly! Voices. (without) Pistol-slugs, hand-grenades, cannon-balls, thunder-bombs. Dom. Through the briar and bramble prickly, Let them pass! let them pass! our brave captain arrives. [the other Brigands enter by the mountain path, R. Chorus of Brigands. Two by two, or three by three, Four by four, as the case may be, Do we scour the glades nocturnal, Prowling after deeds infernal. Enter Carmagnola with more Brigands, L. Dom. Carmagnola! Car. Hold your tongue—hide yourself! Dom. But why? Car. Will you be off? Dom. What mystery is rife, sir? Car. No answer I give—if you value your life, sir, Hide yourself! Dom. Let us hide. Chorus as before. Two by two, three by three, Four by four, as the case may be, Thus we prowl through glades nocturnal, As we compass deeds infernal. [they conceal themselves behind rocks.—Enter over mountain L. a venerable Hermit, followed by eight young Peasant Girls.— Day breaks. Fiametta. For many a mile, till we are weary, Good hermit, have we followed thee— And yet thy cavern bleak and dreary We grieve to say, we do not see. Ah! tell us kindly, Where, so blindly— Where on earth are we going to? Hermit (in a disguised voice) This is the road to wisdom true. Zerlina. It is a pretty road, no doubt, And a pleasant road to travel by, But it seems very much to wind about, As we pursue it wearily. Ah! tell us kindly, Where so blindly— Where on earth will it take us to? Hermit. (as before) This is the road to wisdom true. Fia. Say, shall we soon arrive? Ah! tell us kindly, Trusting blindly— Say, shall we soon arrive? The Hermit (throwing off his beard and gown, and appearing as Falsacappa, Chief of the Banditti). We have arrived, my dears! Wom. Falsacappa! Cecinella. We are lost—hope is past! Fal. Yes, 'tis I—'tis Falsacappa— You never dreamt of this, ha, ha! All. Falsacappa! Fal. Who is the chief, whose brown banditti Pillages every passer by? All. Falsacappa! Fal. Who is the dread of town and city? Who is the robber chief? Reply! All. Falsacappa! Fal. Often I bid my band assemble, Collar a traveller, all a-tremble— And he in a fright, Unhappy wight, Cries as he falls, terrified quite, “'Tis Ernesto Falsacappa.” All. Falsacappa! Fal. Who is the chief whose reckless blade is Sheathed when he sees a woman's dress? All. Falsacappa! Fal. Who, when he meets with fair young ladies, Tempers his code with gentleness? All. Falsacappa! Fal. Oft, when I bid my band assemble, Many a pretty girl, all a-tremble, Falls at my feet, enamoured, quite, Crying aloud, mad with delight, “'Tis Ernesto Falsacappa!” All. Falsacappa! Long live Falsacappa! / Mercy, Falsacappa! Fal. What do you fear, pretty dear? Not Falsacappa, my darling? Quickly, away you go—presto, presto! Off to your duty below—presto, presto! All, all, away—excepting ye, Who are my brave lieutenants three. Brig. Now to our, &amp;c. Ensemble. Women When of our charms they think, they think, they think, The terrible fellows, they wink, they wink, Ogle us all—they do—they do! Its flattering pr'aps, but startling too! Bri. Now to our hiding places go, &amp;c. Bri. These sweet girls with dancing eyes, sir— These fair maidens are our prize, sir, Oh captain, say that they are ours— Fal. Let them be! Bri. Oh, but why? Fal. Shut them up in the cave—all in solitude quite— We will decide on their fate by lot, by lot, to-night All. By lot to-night!—to-night! Fal. Now to your hiding places go, &amp;c. Bri. Now to our hiding places go, &amp;c. Women When of women they think, &amp;c. [some of the Brigands enter with the women into the cave— others exeunt R. and L. Pietro enters over the mountain, L. Fal. Wine and women! they think of nothing else! Ha, Pietro, what's the matter? Pie. Captain, a deputation of your men is anxious to have a word with you. Fal. Very good—fire away. Bar. Well, captain, we've got a greviance. Fal. Most men have. Bar. Ah, but ours is not an every day grievance. Fal. I'm glad of that. What do you complain of? Bar. Well we havn't enough work to do— Far. That, certainly is not an every day grievance—but descend to particulars. Dom. Well, then, the business don't pay. Last week we marched ninety miles to steal seventeen francs. Bar, Which had to be divided among sixty-three claimants. Car. And ten francs of it you took yourself. Now it is our unanimous opinion that—(aside to the others) What is our unanimous opinion? (they whisper to him) Oh! of course, yes, (aloud)—it is our unanimous opinion that something must be done! Fal. (aside to Pie.) What shall I say? Pie. Better promise them something, or perhaps, if you gave them the ten francs— Fal. (after consideration) I think I would rather promise them something, (aloud) Gentlemen, you desire that something should be done. Good. Something shall be done forthwith. Upon my honour, gentlemen. Bar. We don't like the security! Fal. Well then, by the head of my daughter, Fiorella, I swear, that to-morrow morning you shall be employed upon a most lucrative expedition —there! Ah—here she comes! Enter Fiorella over mountain from L., she carries a carbine. Song—Fio. A hat and a bright little feather— Gun on my shoulder, so— A dagger in scabbard of leather, A pistol for a foe! And when the banditti are sleeping, Down in yon rocky dell, My bright eyes a vigil are keeping My father's sentinel! A carbineer if you can show me, Doomed to be shot is he— Bang! bang! Ah, 'tis Fiorella, they know me! The brigand's daughter, she! I climb just like a chamois ranger— O'er rock and mountain spire, When I meet with terrible danger My young heart is all a-fire! My courage, I've shown, is high mettled. My hand, though few my years, Already finally has settled, A dozen carbineers! A carbineer if you can show me, Doomed to be shot is he! Bang! Bang! Ah, 'tis Fiorella—they know me! The brigand's daughter I! All. Ah, 'tis Fiorella—we know thee! The brigand's daughter thou! Fal. My daughter! Fio. My father! (they embrace Fal. Gentlemen, I will explain the expedition to which I referred. You are aware that a marriage is announced between the Princess of Grenada and our young sovereign the Duke of Mantua? Bar. We are! Fal. Good. In honour of this marriage, certain entertainments will be given at the ducal palace; in issuing these invitations it is possible that we may be overlooked, nevertheless, gentlemen, we will be there, you understand, we will be there. Now go. Pie. Long live Falsacappa! (more loudly as if to excite the others.) Long live Falsacappa! All. (very quiety.) Long live Falsacappa! Fal. Really, gentlemen, this enthusiasm overpowers me, the exertion must be tremendous. No doubt you would like to lie down after it—go, my friends, and recruit exhausted nature. [exeunt Dom. R., Bar. and Car. into the cavern. Fio. Papa, do you know that this is your birth-day? Fal. My birthday? to be sure it is! Fio. Well, here is a little present. [giving box. Fal. A little present? (opens it and a little Jack-in-the-box gend'arme springs out.) Hullo, what's this? Agend'arme? Fio. A gend'arme? That's my little professional joke. Fal. Then your little professional joke is in very bad taste. Don't you joke on serious subjects again. Fio. There's—there's something else. Fal. (looking into box.) Why so there is, a portrait. (taking out portrait.) Your portrait, Fiorella? This is a surprise, and in court dress, too. Kiss me. (kisses her.) Why how grave you look! what's the matter, have you got a grievance too? Fio. Yes, I have. Fal. Oh, I thought so. Fio. Father, I don't like this life, and that's the truth: it isn't respectable, it isn't indeed. I own to having felt serious scruples lately. Fal. Oh! only lately. Fio. Yes, since the day when our band attacked that comfortable young farmer. Fal. Which comfortable young farmer? We've attacked so many comfortable young farmers. Fio. I mean Fragoletto,—last Wednesday. Well, while you were all engaged pillaging his house, I couldn't assist—I couldn't move a finger, my eyes were fixed on him, and as I looked at his beautiful face, I began to think that this sort of thing was extremely wrong. I—hush, someone comes. Brigands (without.) Here he is, bring him in. Dom. A prisoner! a prisoner! [enter Dom. leading Fra., followed by the rest of the band enter from all sides, five or six Brigands, R. Chorus. We've seized this very little chap, Perhaps he isn't worth a rap— If but a franc he'll us allow, Why that is something anyhow. Fio. (aside,) Tis he! Fra. (aside.) Tis she! Fio. (aside.) Tis he, I must dissemble. Dom. My friends, he's safe, all right, I've got him, and I've got him tight! Fra. Your sense, not over bright, Allow me to awaken, You say you got me tight, I think you are mistaken, Quite mistaken, One blow and down you go. [frees himself, knocking down Dom., the other Brigands threaten Fra. with daggers. All. Die, reckless little fellow! Fio. (drawing her dagger and defending Fra.) Oh dear no! oh dear no! [she takes his hand. Fal. This inaning Want's explaining, There's a mystery somewhere here; Perhaps my daughter, (As I've caught her,) Will consent to make it clear. Ensemble. Fal. This inaning Wants explaining, &amp;c. Fra. &amp; Fio. This inaning Wants explaining? Well, to me the girl/lad is dear. So, your daughter, (As you've caught her) Condescends to make it clear. Brig. This inaning She's explainining— Why to her the lad is dear! Thus, your daughter (As you've caught her) Condescends to make it clear. All. Yield! Fra. Certainly. I yield to this charming young lady. You are all very zealous fellows, but, like many other zealous fellows, you give yourselves a great deal of unnecessary trouble. Fal. Explain yourself. Fra. I will, captain: your men lay in wait for me during the last half hour. They then rushed out upon me, and seizing me by the throat, they swore they would drag me into your presence. Nothwithstanding the oppressive weather, they carried their threat into execution, with a display of energy worthy of a better cause. See how pumped they are. They might have spared themselves the trouble, as I was coming of my own accord. Fal. Coming of your own accord! Why, you must be mad. Fra. No; not exactly mad—I'm in love. Fal. It's the same thing. Fra. I'm in love with your daughter. Fal. Indeed! I'm very much flattered— Fra. Not at all. I'll tell you all about it. Song—Fra. When you on my cottage employed Your taste for depredation, At first I was rather annoyed, But that was of brief duration. For, Miss, when you then met my view, Vanished all traces of sorrow, I hoped 'twould be my fortune to Be robbed again tomorrow. “You may pillage all day,” thought I, “Pillage, and burn, and slaughter, “So that you let me stand by, “Gazing upon your daughter.” They know their business, well, I own, These men of your commanding, For, when you left me all alone, My walls alone were standing! You took my wheat and barley crop, The hook with which I reap them, My clock—my bed—my razor-strop— You've got them—you may keep them. You may pillage all day, say I, &amp;c. Fal. Fire and fury—why, this amounts to a declaration! You appear to forget, sir, that you are— Fra. An honest man? Ah, I thought that would be an objection. Fal. Marry my daughter to an honest man! Never! Fra. (taking his hand) I honour your sentiments, sir. They do credit to your head and your heart. You are quite right—you are a scoundrel of the deepest dye, and you want another scoundrel of the deepest dye for a son-in-law. Isn't it so? Fal. Well, it isn't prettily expressed, but as you put it in that way, it is so. You see family traditions must be preserved, and a Falsacappa never yet was guilty of a mésalliance. Fra. Good! Then I'll qualify at once—I join your band. Fio. What devotion! Fal. But what proof have we of your courage? Fra. Try me! Give me a deed of blood! Fal. I will. Come, gentlemen, we will make a short excursion into the mountains to see what stuff this young fellow is made of. [Exeunt Fal. and Brigands, L. who sing chorus “We've got this very little chap.” Fra. Good, I follow. (to Fio.) Mademoiselle, it is for you that I have taken this desperate step—won't you say something to me? Fio. Yes—well—I've heard all you've said— Fra. Well! Fio. And I never was so happy in all my life! Fra. My love! (trying to embrace her.) Fio. Oh dear no—not yet. We will get to that by degrees. It is better to begin at the beginning. This is the beginning. [shakes hands formally Fra. Well, it's very pleasant as far as it goes! Now I'm off! [exit, L. Enter the Duke of Mantua over the mountains—he is elegantly attired in riding dress. Fio. sees him and cries out. Pie. Hey! what's the matter? Fio. Look, a young gentleman! Pri. I beg your pardon—I've lost my way—will you be so good as to direct me to the town? Pie. Oh, it's a very difficult road, my lord, you'll want a guide. I'll go and find one. I won't be a moment. Pri. There's no hurry, my friend, take your time (sighing and looking at Fio.) Oh, there's no hurry! Pie. Hold him tight. I'll be back with the band in a minute. (aloud). I'm off, sir! [exit, L. Fio. (aside) He's very handsome! And to think that in a few minutes he'll be—Ah, it's a pity! Pri. This is quite an adventure. Fio. (aside) I think you'll find it is! Pri. I don't want to frighten you—but I can't help saying that you're uncommonly pretty. Fio. Oh, I'm not a bit frightened. I've heard it before. Pri. It's quite romantic, falling in with you here all alone in the mountains. In about five minutes I shall be over head and ears in love with you. Fio. Five minutes! If it takes as long as that it's no use beginning. In five minutes you'll be—(aside) It is a pity! He's extremely nice! (aloud) Now, if you'll take my advice you'll be off as fast as your legs can carry you. Come, trot! Pri. So I will, when that aged hermit returns. Fio. Ah, you'd better not wait for the aged hermit. He won't come back alone. Pri. No—of course. He'll bring a guide. Fio. A guide! Do you know what I am? Pri. Well, let me see! Yes! I should say an innocent little shepherdess. Fio. Unsophisticated soul! Pri. Well, what are you, then? Fio. Listen! my father is a brigand chief. Pri. And you? Fio. I am—start not—his daughter. Pri. Impossible! Fio. But true! Pri. I don't like brigands. Fio. I do. It's a matter of taste. Pri. And your father will return with his men? Fio. Yes—there are sixty-six of them. Pri. Oh! Then pr'aps I'd better go? Fio. Well, perhaps you had. Pri. And if I do, what will you think of me? Fio. I shall think you a great donkey if you don't. Pri. That decides me. I go. Which is the way? Fio. I'll tell you. Rondeau. Fiorella. Take the turning on the right sir— When you've travelled pretty far, Take the footpath down the height, sir, Till you reach a rocky bar— You will see a pathway winding Where those stately pine trees are, Mind you're careful this in finding, Let it be your guiding star— Please to leave my hand alone, sir, Listen pray to what I say If you must squeeze, squeeze your own, sir, I want mine to point the way. Cross the rocks, but do not tumble— Climb and grapple like a tar, Then you'll see a cottage humble Where you're sure to get a car. Take it with a horse, unless sir, Modest charges you debar— It will drive to your address, sir, If it is not very far. [he kisses her Oh, go away! He dares embrace me! Have done—have done—yet I like it too! Have done, sir, papa will trace me— A minute, and he'll be due— If he returns—in minutes few I think he will astonish you! Go away—go away— Cross the rocks, &amp;c. Ensemble. Fio. Now you know How to go— Not a word, How absurd! Go away Go away! Pri. Now I know How to go, Not a word? How absurd! I'll away As you say I'll away! I'll away! Exit Prince among the rocks, L. Falsacappa, followed by Pietro enters over mountain, L. Fal. Well, where's this young man? Fio. Gone! Fal. Gone! So he is—I see him—wait a bit! [cocks his pistol Fio. Forbear! Fal. Why? Fio. He is too good looking. Fal. Ha! [about to strike her—Pie. interferes. Pie. Hold! She is your daughter! Fal. Ter-rue. [picture. Pie. Tableau. Fio. Forgive me—my conscientious scruples— Fal. Yes, but what's to become of an industrious hard-working brigand, whose daughter's scruples cause her to liberate all the young men he captures? Fio. He was so handsome! After all, its only natural. Fal. My love, in the present artificial condition of society, we cannot afford to listen to the promptings of nature. That which is natural is always unbusiness like. But here come my men. We shall learn how our young friend has behaved in his inaugural expedition. Enter all the Brigands and Fragaletto over mountain. Chorus. Like a tiger, this little chap Stopped a party—man, horse and trap; For his life he cared not a rap— Such a very brave little chap. Enter Fragoletto over mountain, L., holding a courier—a brigand follows, carrying a valise. Fra. Falsacappa, behold my booty, He is a royal messenger— Say that I've fairly done my duty, I shall be quite contented, sir, I listened, and heard his horses trample, As I concealed in ambush lay,— Setting to all a good example, With this I kept his horse at bay. [patting his rifle. Seizing him by the collar, so, sir— I made the man my prisoner; “Folly,” said he, “now let me go, sir, I am a royal messenger.” All. He is a royal messenger.” Fra. Falsacappa, behold my, &amp;c. Once I hesitated— Half a second waited— Weak it was—but then you see This line of life is new to me. Then Fiorella's beauty Nerved me to my duty— Her papa I must obey, And drive all fear away, Thereupon my eyes began to Look on my work with proper pride. I annexed his little portmanteau. Collared his horse and trap beside. He resisted swearing gruffly, Struggled and kicked, despite his fears, Seizing the fellows jacket roughly, I laid his whip about his ears! Clic! clac! Falscappa, behold my booty, &amp;c. Fal. Excellent. Now to examine its contents (opens valise and takes out some documents) Ho! ho! political papers, referring to the marriage of the Princess of Grenada with our sovereign, the Duke of Mantua. (reads) “Deducting the two millions which represent the Princess's dowry, the sum due by the Court of Mantua to the Court of Grenada is reduced to three millions. These three millions will be paid over to the officer who escorts the Princess.” Pie. Three millions! Fal. It further says that the Princess's portrait is enclosed, for purposes of identification, as the Prince has never yet set eyes on her Where is the portrait? Pie. Here! (taking portrait from valise). Fal. It's not bad. But she's not as pretty as Fiorella (taking Fio's portrait from his pocket and comparing them). Gentlemen, as loyal subjects I think we are bound not to interfere with the Prince's matrimonial arrangement. So I shall restore the portrait. (places his daughter's portrait in casket, pockets the portrait of the princess) Pie. Stop! you've made a mistake—you've, ha! ha! you've—ha! ha! you've put your daughter's portrait in the casket instead of the princess's. Fal. Are you sure that it's a mistake? Pie. Why of course— Fal. Pietro, you're an ass. Here, courier—take your valise—take your valise—take your horse, and take yourself off. All. Shame! shame! Fal. Silence, and let him pass! (courier takes valise and exit over mountain L. rapidly) Gentlemen, you desired that something should be done. Very good! To-morrow we put into execution the most magnificent project that it ever occurred to brigand chief to conceive. Send for the ladies—to-night I authorise a judicious revel in honour of the accession to our band. Enter Zerlina, Fiametta, Cecinella, Bianca, and other peasants. Chorus. Come sing, and turn about gaily, Come hail our new friend with a song, His heart is brave—he'll prove it daily— Dignus, dignus, est intrare. Dom. Quick, quick, guitars be quickly bringing, And tambourine. Fal. And bring us also many skins of wine, And we will dance till the gray morning light. Cho. Come, sing, &amp;c. Fal. 'Ere he can join, he, nothing loth, First must take our family oath. Fiorella, let him understand All he must promise to our band. Fio. You swear to bow to every measure, Whatever fortune may occur? Years three, or six, or nine, at pleasure, Renewable at option, sir? Fra. Yes, I swear it! Fio. Here's a brigand's hat, With a ribbon plait. If you feel decided yearnings To enlist in this, our band, Swear that all your little earnings To your captain you will hand; Money, jewels, food, or tillage— Hand it over—then you may. Cho. Money, jewels, food, or tillage, Hand it over—then you may— Fio. &amp; Fra. Sack and pillage town and village, Sack and pillage all the day. Fio. Sometimes, after weary waiting, We catch women—well, take care— Lady-folk are fascinating, If you flirt with them, beware! All their money you may pillage— Nothing else, remember, pray! Pillage, pillage, town and village, Sack and pillage all the day! Cho. Pillage, pillage, &amp;c. Fra. Never fear, my dear young lady, Hear me swear it, as I sing, I should be a scoundrel shady, Did I dream of such a thing! All the terms that you're revealing, I agree to cheerfully. Cho. All the terms, &amp;c. Fra. If a kiss I must be stealing, I will steal it, dear, from thee. Fio. If a kiss you must be stealing, You may steal it dear, from me. Cho. Pillage, pillage, &amp;c. Cho. Yes, we will hail our comrade gaily Worthy is he—he'll prove it daily! Fal. We will be quite, Jolly to-night! Cho. We will be quite Jolly to-night! Each with his arm round his young lady Stroll among rocks and valleys shady— We will be quite Jolly to-night! Fio. Dancing and singing, Dance and folly, We'll be jolly As can be! Away from me, Melancholy. From thought of care I would be free. Cho. With song and wine, &amp;c. We will be quite Unchecked to night! We will be quite Tipsy to-night. Each with his arm, &amp;c. Pie. Listen pray—listen pray—what is that I hear? Look there—look there—by yonder mountain! The glitter of armour appears— Fal. Danger is near! All. Danger is near! Fal. I think I recognise the tramp, tramp— I recognise the tramp, and the tramp, and the tramp— These are the royal carbineers! Cam., Dom. &amp; Pie. These are the royal carbineers! Fal. I hear the tramp and the tramp, and the tramp, All. The tramp, tramp of the carbineers, Fra. If we must fight, why here, why here am I? Fal. Stop a bit my man—by and-bye! Although we show no fear or pallor Perhaps we can a better plan devise— Discretion we must exercise, It is the better part of valour. Be wary—be wary. [they conceal themselves. Cho. I'm sure I hear the tramp, and the tramp, &amp;c. Enter the Carbineers, R. They cross the stage singing. We are mighty carbineers All with glorious careers, But it is most unfortunate, That though we feel no kind of fears Somehow we are always too late! Dom. (re-appearing) These muffs their duties have they ended? Have they gone? to the town descended? These muffs their duties have not ended— Fal. These muffs, I see, have re-ascended! Silence again! All. Silence again! [they conceal themselves Carbineers re-enter, L., and cross the stage. Chorus of carbineers. We are mighty carbineers, &amp;c. [exeunt, R. Bri. We think we heard the tramp, tramp, &amp;c. Fal. Be silent, and we'll baulk the foe— Be still—be still until they go— We'll sing, very low— Quite low—quite low— Piano— Pianissimo— All. (in a whisper) We think we heard, &amp;c. Cho. With song and wine, Dance and folly, &amp;c. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. A country landscape. A large inn, L., with practicable balcony. Above balcony a small window. The entrance to a cellar in view of the audience. Pipo, Pipa, Pipetta, with four male and four female cooks discovered preparing a feast. Cho. Gaily does our furnace roar— Cooking pig and sheep and boar— Customers we do invite We are ready for them quite. Pip. Gentlemen, I do implore Do your best and even more— Customers will come to-day Who reckon little what they pay. All. Who reckon little what they pay. [Exeunt Pip. and Pipe. into the inn. Enter R., Falsacappa, Pietro, Fragoletto, Domino, Carmagnola, Zerlina, Fiametta, Bianca, Cicinella, and all the brigands, dressed absurdly as beggars. Pie. &amp; Fra. Spare a roll—a penny thing— Give us something, pray Not a bit of anything Have we touched to-day! Facitote caritatem! Date panem, date panem! Pip. Go to the devil—I've nothing for you. Fal. &amp; Fio. Spare a roll, &amp;c. Dom., Bar. &amp; Car. Spare a roll, &amp;c. [The brigands stop Pipo's escape at all sides. All. Facitote caritatem! Date panem—date panem! Pip. Now what is the meaning of all this? Alt. (very loudly) Spare a roll, &amp;c. Fal. (taking off his beggar's dress) Seize that fellow and hold him tight. Car. (seizing Pip.) All right, Falscappa, I've got him! Fal. Now my man, answer my questions. I believe you expect, shortly, the escort sent by our august sovereign, the Duke of Mantua, to conduct his bride, the Princess of Grenada to the Ducal Palace? Pip. Quite true, sir— Fal. And moreover, you also expect the Princess and her suite, who will pass the night at your inn. In short, the Princess and her escort are to meet here? Pip. He knows all about it! Fal. (to brigands) Take this person and shut him up with his wife and daughter and servants in that cellar. (two brigands lead him away). Now, gentlemen, you see my scheme. We shall assume the characters of the Princess and her escort, and in twenty-four hours we shall be in the Ducal Palace. The three millions will be handed over to us as a matter of course. Car. There ought to be good pickings at the palace, besides snuff-boxes, watches, pocket handkerchiefs! Fal. Ah! Now let us understand one another. Once for all, I won't have anything of the kind. We shall be there in the capacities of courtiers and men of rank, and if we are caught picking pockets, it will be noticed. Pie. I see—to steal anything under three millions would be derogatory to our position as gentlemen of rank. Fal. Exactly. Always rob according to your position in society. My daughter will assist us, and she will thus atone for her weakness in having allowed that young man to escape yesterday. Is that understood? Fio. Yes—on one condition—that if we are successful, I am allowed to marry Fragoletto immediately. Fal. The first notary we come across shall draw up the contract. Fra. Good! mind, the very first! I'll manage it—(to Pie.) you're the notary—this is what we'll say to him. Duett.—Fra. &amp; Fio. Ho, la! ho, la! good notary Ah, pray you stop—a single moment stay. However short your time may be, A contract, please, you must draw up to-day! Oh stay a single minute— My purse has money in it. Sit down and pray begin it— Tarry here I pray! Prit! prit! prit! “Why, I pray, should I stay? If I stay me, will you pay me?” Sir, the pay, I should say, Will content you anyway! Prit! prit! Cho. Come, begin—on my life, Nothing is so irritating As to be kept long a-waiting When about to take a wife! The pay, sir—the pay, I should say, Will content you, anyway. Prit! Prit! Fra. &amp; Fio. Write away, do, we both are quite ready, Begin, begin, why make all this to do? You'll find my/his back a table steady, Begin—you've got your cue! While you are busy writing, Department uninviting, This is what we'll do. [noise of kisses. Come, I say—quick, obey— Why delay in beginning. Come, I say—quick, obey— Come, quick, make us happy to-day! [noise of kisses. The four Girls. Begin, you've got your cue, &amp;c. Fra. &amp; Fio. Should he expect us to be paying, (Which, I'm told, is the way of his race, Little we'll heed what he is saying, Loudly and gaily we'll laugh in his face. If he wants to escape with an unimpaired noddle, He'll waste no more time, but away he will toddle. Ha! ha! Cho. Begin, you've got your cue, &amp;c. Fal. Now then, to business. Fragoletto, go and see the innkeeper and his servants in the cellar, and bring us their costumes. Fra. I go. [exit into cellar. Fal. Carmagnola, post yourself on the road to Mantua, and let us know when you see the people who are to escort the princess. You, Barbavano, post yourself on the road to Grenada, and as soon as you see the Princess and her retinue, let us know. Car. &amp; Bar. We go! [exeunt R. and L. Cho. We'll take care, We'll beware, We'll be sure to obey you— We will work in the way you May think proper to declare. [Fio. and Brigands enter the inn. Fal. (to Pie.) Why, what's the matter? you seem out of spirits. Pie. I was thinking of the good old days when robbery was an honest, straightforward profession; when we contented ourselves with stopping mail coaches and robbing the passengers. No low cunning about that; all straightforward and above-board—but now that robbery is reduced to a science, its altogether beyond me—I don't understand it. Fal. What are you referring to? Pie. This business you were speaking of—this dressing yourselves up as somebody else, and passing yourself off as other people—its tricky— its very tricky. Fal. Not at all, its the simplest thing in the world. In the first place, we assume the character of these hotel people, in order to receive the escort from Mantua. Having effected this, we confine them in their tavern, and, assuming their characters, we receive the Princess and her party, from Grenada. Lastly, we confine the Princess and her party, and in their capacities we make the best of our way to Mantua, and collar the three millions. Simplest thing in the world. Pie. Simplest thing in the world! (aside) I don't know what he means. Enter Fragoletto from inn, with cook's dresses. Fra. The innkeeper and his people are in the wine-cellar, and our comrades are dressing themselves in their clothes. Here are three costumes for ourselves. Fal. (taking them.) Good! Pietro, here's one for you—(to Fra.) one for you—and one for me. Now then—the white jacket—all at once. Ready? All. Ready! Fal. One, two, three—go! (they all put on their jackets.) Good! Now, the aprons. (Fra. puts on his apron) One, two, three—Go! (Fal. and Pie. put on the aprons—they then see that Fra. has been too quick for them.) Come, I say, gentlemen, time, gentlemen, time! Now, the nightcaps! Now, do, please, try and keep time with the night-caps. One, two, three—go! Done; now all we want is a customer—I should go up to him and I should say— Song. [Fal.] Walk in—walk in—walk in, I pray you! Walk in—walk in, your dinner we'll prepare! We all are anxious to obey you, Come read our bill—ample bill of fare. And should our customer Be of the female gender, Why, then we'll welcome her With accents low and tender. Speaking thus, All of us— “Walk in, my pretty lady, do— What madam, can we do for you? What can we do? What can we do? What? what?” “I seek an agreeable diet, My strength to renew— I want to lie down and be quiet, An hour or two!” Fra. Pray walk you in— Pray walk you in— Your little meal you can begin. All. Pray walk you in, &amp;c. Pie. Your favours we would gladly win— So pray walk in—so pray walk in! Our beds are of the softest feather— If any body says to you “Their cutlets are made of leather,” On my word it is not true! All. It is not true! Fal. Madam if you doubt our cooking— All. Doubt our cooking Critically at us looking Will at once solve any doubt! All. Any doubt! Any doubt! Madam, if you doubt our cooking, You don't—you don't know what you talk about Fra. Pray walk in and take your ease, We will try to serve your ends Pray walk in, and if you please, Recommend us to your friends! Pie. 'Tis I do the chopping— Fra. And I the carving Fal. Yes—and I and, the killing and halving! All. Madam, if you doubt our cooking, Critically at us looking, Will at once solve any doubt— If you're wise—if your wise, Try our stews and try our fries— Try our lovely apple pies— Try our apple pies! Enter Carmagnola running, L. U. E. Car. Captain—the escort is in sight—they'll be here directly! Fal. What does it consist of? Car. There's a little fat nobleman— Fal. I know him—the minister of foreign affairs. Car. There's the captain of the carbineers— Fal. I know him—he's a very old acquaintance. Car. And six of his men, with two buglers. Fal. Good—here they come! Quick, Fragoletto, see if our men are ready. Fra. , calling to people in the inn. Prepare—prepare— Get ready, there! Ensemble. Prepare—prepare— Get ready there! Enter from inn, Domino, Zerlina, Fiametta, Bianca, Cicinella, and Brigands, all dressed as cooks. Cho. Behold us here, So have no fear— Ourselves we've been preparing— Observe, observe our bearing And have no fear Fal. Very good—very good, indeed! Here comes the escort. Now, do you remember that you are cooks. Don't forget that, for once in your lives, you've a character to sustain. Enter the Baron Campotasso, the Captain of Carbineers, Carbineers and two pages. Bri. Keep up the game—keep up the game— Pray be cooks in deed as in name! Compotasso (looking at brigands). For men, whose province is cooking, They're most peculiar looking— Pray tell me when, if you please, Did you see such cooks as these? Bri. Keep up the game, &amp;c. Cam. We are lords of the court—no less! We were commanded by his highness, “Go and receive my fair princess, Better to overcome her shyness.” Cap. (proudly). Commanded by his highness! Cam. Said the Prince to us two—us two— “Baron,” said he, “you'll greatly charm me, If you will kindly take with you Some one to represent the army! Cap. (proudly). I represent the army! Fra. He is the army! Cam. &amp; Cap. Now you all know, from me—from me— How our Prince pays his addresses, How he despatched an embassy To meet the fairest of princesses! Cam. Embassy such as this he's wise To entrust to our commanding— Wishing at once to please her eyes And appeal to her understanding! Cap. And appeal to her understanding! Cam. “Show her,” said he, “my court, 'tis fit, That she should know how grand its tone is— So I will send a man of wit— Backing him up with an Adonis!” Cap. I, sir, am the Adonis! Cam. He, sir, is the Adonis! All. What an Adonis! Cam. &amp; Cap. Now you all know from me, &amp;c. Cho. Now we all know from ye, &amp;c. Fal. (to Cam.) I presume, sir, that I have the honour of addressing— Cam. His Excellency Baron Campotasso? You have. And you are Pipo? Pie. I am Pipo. Brig. (laughing) Oh! yes; he's Pipo, sure enough. Fal. (to Cam.) Make your mind easy on that score. Most certainly he is Pipo. Cap. Oh! There seems to be no doubt about his identity. Cam. These are queer looking cooks. Are these culinary implements? (pointing to daggers and pistols in their belts.) Fal. Yes; we use them in cooking geese. Besides, they say that Falsacappa is in the neighbourhood. Cap. Falsacappa, indeed! Why, I cut him in two, last night. Fal. Eh? Cap. Fact; right across here! Fal. But are you sure you're not mistaken? because he was seen in the neighbourhood this very morning. Cap. Mistaken? Well, of course, we're all liable to that. Of course, when I say I cut him in two, I speak figuratively—I mean that, in my mind's eye, cut him in two. Fal. Across here? Cap. Yes, just there. Enter Barbavano. Bar. (aside to Fal.) The Princess and suite are in sight, and will be here in a few minutes. Fal. Oh, very good (to Cam.) Here, you get in there. Cam. (indignant) Sir! Fal. Get along in—no nonsense—come— Cam. This language, sir, is— Fal. I know, it's not the thing—but we've no time to stand on ceremony —come, in you go. Chorus of Brigands. In you go, Come, bustle, you know, Don't be all day—don't be all day. The Escort. Come, I say, Come, I say, Do not push us, pray! Brigands. That's the way, Escort. Don't push us, pray. Brigands. Do not be all day! [the Brigands push them into hotel and follow them. Enter, R. U. E., Gloria Cassis, the Preceptor, the Princess of Grenada, her page Adolphe, four Lords, four Ladies, and four pages.—All have tambourines and castanets, with which they accompany themselves as they sing and dance. Cho. Grenada, Spain's most favoured city, Oh, town of sad intriguing ways, Since last we saw thee (more's the pity), There have elapsed just fourteen days. [dance, Ado. (to Prin.) Though for a while we here together tarry, To-morrow morning we must part. Prin. Yes, for a Royal Highness I must marry Whom I detest with all my heart. [dance. Cho. Grenada, Spain's most favoured, &amp;c. Glo. (to Prin.) Though, I own, by the course before you, Another new country you gain, Remember, I humbly implore you, Your ancestors' country is Spain, Though they'll teach you to love the new one, (Well, well, of that I don't complain), Don't forget, my brave and true one, That the land of your birth is Spain! Ah! There are some who are Spaniards by birth, There are some who are not Spaniards by birth, We are all genuine Spaniards by birth, Unlike people who are not Spaniards by birth. Cho. There are some, &amp;c. [dance. Glo. And, oh, when unexampled power, In the course of events you gain, Pray devote ev'ry single hour To the good of your country, Spain. Oh, give all the important places To your countrymen, free from guile, And if Mantua makes wry faces, Why, Grenada will sweetly smile. Ah! There are some, &amp;c. Cho. There are some, &amp;c. [dance. Prin. It was here, I believe that we were to have been received? Glo. Certainly, your highness. Prin. But the place seems deserted. This is impertinent neglect. Ado. It is simply infamous. Pre. (shouting) Hi! within there! Is anybody at home? Fal. (within) One moment, sir—one moment— (Window is opened and Fal. appears on the balcony in the act of dressing himself. He wears the coat and cuirass of the Captain. Fal. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to see you. What can I do for you? But stop—perhaps you are the Grenada lot? Prin. The Grenada lot! Glo. This is the Princess of Granada, and we are her suite. And you, I presume are one of the escort sent to conduct the Princess to the Duke. Fal. Exactly, I am the Captain of the Duke of Mantua's Carbineers. There is a lot of us, too. There are all my men, and there's the baron— the baron—dear me, I always forget that baron's name. Glo. The Baron Campotasso. Fal. That's it and all his little pages—it's a beautiful sight (calling) Hi, Baron—Baron—(to Glo.) I beg your pardon—I never can remember that Baron's name? Glo. Campotasso. Fal. Of course—much obliged (calls) Campotasso! [Window opens over balcony, Pie. appears dressing himself Pie. Now then—I'm Campotasso—what's the matter? Fal. Here's the Grenada lot— Pie. Nonsense! Fal. It is, honour! Pie. Indeed! I beg your pardon, Princess, I'll be down in one moment. [they both disappear Pri. This treatment is infamous. Glo. It's all of a piece, your highness. You've been sold like a bale of goods, and you must expect to be treated like one. Two millions— that was your price. But there are three millions still due, and they are to be paid over to me, and if they fail— Enter Falsacappa as Captain of Carbineers to the waist, below, as a brigand—his cuirass is wrong side before, and he has only one epaulette. Fal. Here I am, Princess! Glo. Why, what's this? Fal. Captain of the Duke of Mantua's Carbineers. I'll call my men. Hi! fall in! Enter the Brigands grotesquely dressed as Carbineers—all the uniforms are incomplete, and all wear breeches and stockings of brigands except Carmagnole, who has a jack-boot on his left leg. Fal. Neat turn out, isn't it? Glo. I dont agree with you—your uniforms are very incomplete. Fal. Light marching order, Princess. They are magnificent soldiers. Should you like to see them execute a few movements? Now do. Pri. No, we should be sorry to trouble you. Fal. No trouble, ma'am. You shall see. Attention! (he draws his sword) Draw swords! [The Carbineers' swords are enormous. Car. and Bar. succeed with difficulty in drawing theirs. Dom., who is small, fails altogether. Glo. The little beggar can't do it. Fal. He's nervous—besides, he never can. Now then, if you'd like to inspect us. Prin. Oh dear no—not at all. Fal. Attention! come—trot! [The Carbineers, led by Fal., trot in single file round the Spaniards Fal. Halt! there—they shall do that again if you like. Glo. No—that will do. Enter Pietro dressed in Compotassa's clothes to the waist Fal. Come, Baron, we've been waiting for you. Pie. Coming, sir, coming! What can I get for you—soup, fish, steaks, filet de bœuf— Fal. (aside to Pie.) You ass, what are you talking about? Pie. Why, if I'm a waiter I must talk like a waiter! Fal. But you're not a waiter now—that's all over. Pie. What the devil am I, then? Fal. Why, you're the Baron—the Baron—(to Glo.) I forget this Baron's name again. Glo. Campotasso. Fal. Of course. (to Pie.) You're the Baron Campotasso, come to escort the Princess. Pie. To be sure—how dull I am! (to Glo.) I really beg your pardon —but one moment I'm a cook, and the next I'm a baron—and I got confused. Prin. A cook? Fal. Its a joke of his—about cabinet pudding—you understand—he's a minister—in the cabinet—cabinet pudding. Don't mind him—its his only one—he always lets it off. It won't occur again. Prin. (pityingly) Poor fellow. Glo. (to Pie.) Allow me to introduce the Princess's suite. I am the Count Gloria Cassis, Grandee of Spain; this is Pablo, the Princess's Preceptor; four lords, who are nobody in particular; Adolphe, of Valladolid— Prin. My favourite page. He never leaves me.

Enter Fragoletto as inkeeper, Fiorella as Pipa, and four women as servants. Fio. Princess, your rooms are ready. Prin. Well, thank goodness, here are people who look like human beings at last. Are you the master of this hotel? Fra. I am—and this is my intended. We are going to be married. Prin. How interesting—tell me all about it. Song—Fio. Indeed, I cannot tell you clearly How in my bosom he found a place, I felt that I loved him sincerely When I set eyes on his dear little face. Ah, well, people say, love is full of sweet surprises! How can one say how love arises? I loved, and I loved beyond measure— Gazed on his face, and I thought, with a sigh, Unless I could marry my treasure, Life had no charm—I should certainly die. Ah, well, &amp;c. Fal. Princess, allow me to remind you that your rooms are ready. Prin. Very good—I hear you. Fal. I repeat, madam, they are ready. Prin. And I repeat that I hear you. Fal. Quite ready. Perhaps you would like to retire to rest? Prin. Certainly not—it is barely two o'clock. Who ever heard of such a thing? Fal. I beg your pardon, I must obey my instructions, which say that you are to go to bed as soon as you arrive, and in accordance with my instructions, to bed you go. Prin. What audacity! Glo., Ado. Allow me to remind you, sir—/Upon my word, sir— Fal. Now, look here—once for all—trot—all of you—come! Prin. But— Fal. (to Brigands) In with them, quick. Can't stand shilly-shallying here all day.

Then, we lock their doors, having first removed their clothes, and then— Ensemble. We, without pomp or martial show Off to the Mantuan Court will go; No trumpet sounding—no, nor drum. We will receive, with humble thanks, Something like three million francs. Fal. Pietro, mind the preceptor thou shalt be. Pie. Yes, to be sure! Fal. Yes, to be sure!

Pretty page in waiting! Fra. Princess, captivating! Fio. With a burning love— Fra. With a burning love— Fio. You must love me now. Fra. I will love thee now! Car., Bar., Pie., Dom. &amp; Fal.

(spoken) The carbineers—I forgot all about them! Glo. (appearing at balcony) What are these shouts rending the air? What is the matter, pray, in there? Pie. Nothing, sir—only cheers— Glo. That, I know—for I have ears. Pipo, in shirt sleeves, rushes from the cellar. Pip. Oh, help! oh, help! I sink with fear! Fal. (aside) The devil take him—Pipo here! Pip. It is Falsacappa, oh, dear!

Princess, Adolphe, Gloria, Preceptor and Spaniards come from the inn. Span. Falsacappa! Who mentioned that terrible name? ha, ha! Fal. Your highness, why leave your room, so pleasant and charming? Why leave—why leave your room to come out here? Prin. This terrible noise, it's alarming, There's something wrong in there, I fear. Span. Somebody said “Falsacappa!” Glo. Say, have you seen Falsacappa?” Fal. Whoever said “Falsacappa?” All. Whoever said “Falsacappa?” Fal. Who mentioned him—pray show him. Falsacappa! don't know him! Don't know him at all, Bri. Don't know him at all! Fal. We don't know him at all, not at all, not at all, not at all. Campotasso, half undressed, appears on the balcony. Cam. (indicating Fal.—spoken There he is—I know him. Seize him! He is the brigand chief! Brigands enter from all sides, carrying carbines, with which Falsacappa and the others arm themselves. The Brigands are L., the Spaniards, R., Pipo is in the hands of the Brigands. Fal. (to Cam. on balcony) I much prefer always to treat my pris'nors gently, But as they kick, why evidently, I must disarm them violently. Yes, you've heard—yes, in truth you've heard my name! Falsacappa, the same! I'm Ernesto Falsacappa! Collar those men—collar them, ha! [Cam. disappears. All. Falsacappa! [Spaniards kneel. Fi.

Struggle and kick if you dare— All. Beware, &amp;c. Cam. (re-appearing on balcony) Tremble no more at this treacherous dealing, For I have found, in the cellar concealing, Soldiers whose trade is to fight such a foe, And they will come to your succour I know. Fal. Then will we fight them here, ha! ha! So take care! so take care! All. Then will we fight, &amp;c. Long live—long live Falsacappa? Cam. comes from the inn with the carbineers, who are all drunk. They hold bottles in their hands. Cam. Here they are—here they are—here they are—here they are [The Carbineers fraternise with the brigands. Carbineers. Yes, we are brave carbineers, We'll finish your evil careers. All. (Brigands gaily, Spaniards sadly). But it is most unfortunate, That though you come to calm our/their fears, Yet strange to state, Yet strange to state, Somehow you're always just too late. Fal. When they are tipsy, as you see, They are as friendly as can be. Bri. Beware—beware, Tremble, for in crowds we assemble, &amp;c. Span. Beware—beware, Tremble, for in crowds they assemble.

Prince discovered at supper with various ladies of his court Chorus. Aurora appears—we'll hail Aurora— Welcome her with a chorus gay— Cover our Prince with gifts of Flora, His bachelorhood will end to-day! Marchioness. I dread to-morrow morn arriving, The saddest event since I was born! Duchess. His court of his fair self depriving, He will marry to-morrow morn! Mar. His court depriving! Duc. His court depriving! Cho. Aurora appears, &amp;c. Pri. You'd like to hear me sing? I'll warble you a ditty, Which describes me exactly—that fact wil give it zest Mar. &amp; Duc. Whatever song you sing—or commonplace or witty— It's certain to excite our deepest interest! Song—Pri. A prince there was, whose beauty, Shone like the moon above— All. Shone like the moon above—! His ladies, as in duty, With him all fell in love! All. With him all fell in love! Pri. And one, a lovely maiden, Would wait in doubt no more, So, with her love o'erladen, She tapped thus at his door— Rat tat! rat tat! “Come open, Prince,” the maiden cried— “When a loving girl implores thee— Rat tat! Come open, sir, and open wide To a maiden who adores thee! Rat tat!” All. Come open Prince, &amp;c. Come open, sir, and open wide Pri. “Return my pretty lady, Return,” the Prince replied. All. “Return,” the Prince replied. Pri. “To nature's forests shady— Alas! I have a bride!” All. Alas! he has a bride! Pri. “To stray from virtuous courses Of course I would not dare,” Said she “There are divorces And so I won't despair!” Pan, pan, &amp;c. All. Come open, sir, and open wide, &amp;c. Enter Treasurer. Tre. Your Royal Highness did your Treasurer the honour to send for him. He is here! Duc. The Treasurer! I love a treasurer! I wonder if he was sent for on our account! Pri. Treasurer, you look dispirited—what's the matter with you? Tre. Dispirited? I dare say I do. An error in my official accounts has kept me awake all night. It was only a half-penny, but to a conscientious official the amount is of little consequence. I couldn't detect the cause of the inaccuracy, so I put it down to— Mar. To what? Tre. Sundries! Pri. And how many sundries do you get for a half-penny? Tre. It depends. The price of a sundry varies with the inaccuracies in my accounts. Pri. Well, how do we stand at present. Are we pretty rich? Tre. Rich? Rich isn't the word! (aside) That's true enough! Pri. Then pay the Marchioness's rent for the past year! Mar. Oh, Prince! Pri. You will also have the goodness to pay the Duchess's milliner's bill. The milliner shall call on you to-morrow with the account. Duc. (aside to Tre.) You can let me have the money, and I'll pay it myself. Pri. Now to business. These people who accompany the Princess are to receive three millions from us. Take care to have the money ready. Tre. Three millions? Whew! Pri. Of course. You don't mean to say you haven't got the money. Tre. Oh, of course I've got the money—Oh, yes, I've got the money all right. It would be a pretty look out if I hadn't got the money! Pri. Very good—then take care to have it ready, Now ladies, we will prepare to receive the Princess. Cho. Aurora comes, &amp;c. [Exeunt Pri. and all the Ladies through the doors at back. Tre. Take care your Highness—take care! Those ladies will be your ruin as they have been mine! Your exchequer as now reduced to the insignificant sum of twelve hundred and eighty-three francs twenty-five centimes! Well, I couldn't help it! I'm a creature of impulse, and when a woman asks me for money, I can't refuse it. I never could resist a woman in tears. They know this, and always come to me crying. Song—Treasurer. Oh, woman, in thy soft caresses My happiest moments fly; I love to play with golden tresses, The slave of love am I! In kisses and accents—and accents of honey— In bouquets and presents—and presents not a few, I've dissipated all my money. And all my country's—and all my country's money too. In spite of all the pain Such conduct is entailing, I'd squander it again, Ah, ah! that's my little failing. The consequences are appalling, To fate I'm forced to bow, These pleasures there is no recalling. My cake is eaten now! Despite my endeavour—endeavour—endeavour— My sin—my sin—discovered now will be! Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, Whatever—ever will become of me! Yet, spite of all the pain, &amp;c. Twelve hundred and eighty-three francs, twenty-five centimes! That's two hundred and eighty-three francs, twenty-five centimes for the Marchioness and the Duchess to divide between them—so far my course is easy enough. But the Spanish envoy may not be so easily quieted. If he's an honest man, I'm lost—but if he's a—a—man of the world, the remaining thousand francs will square him. (castanets and music heard without) There they are! They have arrived! Now for it! Oh, woman, woman, woman! Enter the Lords and Ladies of the court. They group themselves on each side of the stage.

Please explain, ma'am, 'tis he! 'tis she Brig. (aside) This is very cheering, Jewel, watch, and ear-ring, Everywhere appearing, Gorgeous array. Prince and all, attacking, Everybody sacking, Then, our booty packing, Take it all away. Court (aside) What an odd parading, Someone has been aiding Them in masquerading, They are villains deep! Black as any niggers, See their ill-bred sniggers, Fingers on our triggers We had better keep. Pri. (aside) 'Tis the little fairy Whom I found so chary, Very, very wary, Only yesterday. Bri. This is very cheering! Court. What an odd parading! Pri. She whom I'm addressing, Then was shepherdessing, And to-day, Princessing! How is this, I pray? Bri. Jewel, watch, and earring! Court. What a masquerading! Fio. This is unexpected, I shall be detected! Wish I had elected Not to go their ways. Bri. All our booty packing! Court. Fingers on our triggers! Fra.

You're so much below him, How can you, miss, know him? I shall quickly show him How to end his days! [repeat ensemble Fio. (aside to Fal) 'Tis he! Pri. (aside) 'Tis the maiden! Fio. (aside to Fal) Let us be off, I fear, With astonishment their mouths are gaping. Fal. Why on earth should we go? Fio. That's the person, my dear, Whom yesterday I helped in escaping! Fal. Are you quite sure? Fio. Quite sure! He knows he has seen me before! Fal. We'll for a flight be preparing. Fio. Only look how he is staring! Fal. We'll be careful. Fra. All this toying Is annoying. [Ensemble as before Pri. Why how's this—where's the escort? Where is the Baron Campotasso? Pie. I, sir, am the Baron Campotasso. Pri. You? Nonsense! Pie. I assure you, sir, that I am the Baron Campotasso (to Fal.) Ain't I? Fal. (aside) No, you idiot—you're the Princess's preceptor, now. Pie. Of course—I forgot. (to Pri.) You were quite right—it was my mistake—I'm the Princess's preceptor now. Pri. (aside) I'll swear that's the girl I met in the mountains yesterday! I'll cross examine her, (aloud). So your Royal Highness is the daughter of the King of Grenada. Fio. So I have been always told. Pri. (aside) Humph! foiled! Stay, another question occurs to me! (aloud) And who, may I ask, reigns at Grenada, just now? Fio. Why the king, of course! Pri. (aside) She's right! and who's this gentleman? (indicating Fra.). Fio. My favourite page. He never leaves me. Fra. Never! Fio. &amp; Fra. Never! All the Bri. Never! Pri. (aside) This quite corresponds with the description I received. It's all right. I must have been mistaken. (aloud) Well, Princess. Fal. First of all, your highness, there's a little matter to arrange. Those three millions. Pri. My treasurer has instructions to pay you the money immediately. Fal. Good! (to Tre.) You heard what his Highness said? Tre. (taking Fal. aside) One moment. I don't want to make any unpleasantness, but one of your noblemen has—it's very awkward, but he has stolen my watch. Fal. Point him out. Tre. It's one of those four. Perhaps you will kindly ask him to restore it? Fal. (to Bri.) Who took that watch? [Dom. Bar. and Car. each take out a watch Fal. Ah, good! (Pie. takes out a fourth watch and offers it timidly). Pietro! I'm ashamed of you! Pie. Force of habit, Captain. I couldn't help it. Fal. (to Tre.) Which is yours? Tre. This one. Thanks very much. (aside) Curious, some of these Spanish customs! [Fal. pockets the other three Pri. Princess, the ladies will show you to your rooms. We shall meet anon. Come, gentlemen. [exeunt all but Fal. and Tre. Fal. Now then, to business. Tre. Good! How will you have it? Long or short? Fal. Quite immaterial. Tre. Good! [they sit at table Fal. If you'd like to see my credentials— Tre. As a matter of form (looking at them). Quite correct. Fal. (aside) That's a mercy. Tre (aside taking out a bank note) If he's an honest man I'm lost— but if he isn't, this bank note ought to square matters. [he fidgets with the ntoe Fal. What do you call that? Tre. I call that a bank note for one thousand francs. Fal. Good. That leaves a balance of two millions nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand. Tre. A balance of how much did you say? Let me see (begins to calculate after having placed the note near Fal. (Seeing that Fal. don't take it, he pushes it nearer. At length he looks up and says, He hasn't taken it! Fal. I repeat that leaves a balance of two millions— Tre. Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand francs. Right to a franc! What a head for figures! Fal. Pretty well—but never mind my head. Let us confine ourselves to these three millions. Tre. Certainly, if you insist. Well, I have to pay you three millions? Fal. To be sure. Tre. And you will pay them over to your government? Fal. Of course. Tre. And what commission will your government allow you, do you think? Fal. I don't know! Tre. I do. Not a penny! That's the way with government. They attend to general interests and neglect particular interests. Happily the particular interests look after themselves—if they didn't— Fal. Now look here. What are you driving at? Tre. Now sit down. Now this is how we are situated—two men of the world. One man of the world at that side of the table, another man of the world at this side of the table. Good! Now let's dismiss the Court of Grenada from our minds. Never mind them. What does it matter to us, as men of the world, whether Grenada has its three millions or not? Fal. Now once for all—I— Tre. Here is a good note for one thousand francs. Well, I place this note there (places note before Fal.). And having placed it there, I dismiss it from my mind. There's an end of it. Where's my pen? Ah, there it is under the table! I'm going to look for it, you understand? I'm going to look for my pen. And I dismiss the thousand franc note from my mind. [he goes under the table Fal. What in the world is he doing? Tre. (reappearing) He hasn't taken it! He's an honest man! Confound him! Fal. Come, once for all, these three millions. Tre. Hush! I'll be frank with you. I haven't got e'm. Fal. (seizing him) What! Tre. I haven't got 'em, but it can be squared, can't it? Fal. I'm sold! He's in the profession! Give me three millions! Fal. seizes the Tre.

By foul or fair means I'll have e'm, I swear! Tre. Forbear, forbear! Fal. I'll have 'em, I swear! Pri. Why, isn't this affair completed? Tre. Sir, I've been exceedingly ill-treated! Fal. Because the debt he will not pay. Bri. Because, &amp;c. Tre. My prince, believe him not, it isn't true! Fal. Your treasurer hasn't got a soul! Pri. Explain this matter, sir! Tre. I'm almost afraid!
