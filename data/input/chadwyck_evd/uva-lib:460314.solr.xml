      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter PHÃDROMUS with a lighted torch, some slaves following him with wine and provisions for an entertainment: and PALINURUS. PALINURUS. Whither away, and at this time of night; Accoutred thus, and with this equipage? PhÃ¦. Where Venus, and her son command me: where Affection calls meâWhether it be midnight, Twilight of evening, dawn of day, no matterâ The assignation made, we must attend 'Spite of our teethâ Pal. At length howe'er, at lengthâ PhÃ¦. At length, howe'er you are impertinent! Phal. 'Tis neither right nor reputable, you Be your own boy, and carry your own wax-light. PhÃ¦. Should I not bring the work of little bees Deriv'd from sweets, to my sweet little honey? Pal. But whither shall I say you're going now? PhÃ¦. Ask me, and I'll inform youâ Pal. Should I ask, What would you answer? PhÃ¦. This the temple is Of Ãsculapiusâ Pal. Well, and that I've known More than a twelvemonthâ PhÃ¦. Next to it, you see A door shut closeâHail! door that shut'st the closest. How hast thou far'd of lateâ Pal. What! has a fever Left you but yesterday, or two days since? Supp'd you last night? PhÃ¦. What! do you laugh at me? Pal. Are you not mad, to hail the door; and ask After its health? PhÃ¦. By Hercules! I've known This door, a door most trusty and most secretâ He mutters not a word: and when he's open'd Is still and hushâAnd when at night, his mistress Comes out to speak with me, in private says Not the least wordâ Phal. Are you not doing, PhÃ¦dromus, Something unworthy of yourself and family; Or else about some prank? Say, are you not Laying a snare to catch some modest girl; Or one at least who ought to be so? PhÃ¦. No. And Jove forbid I should! Pal. I wish the same. I'd have you always so to place your love, If you are wise, that if the town should know it, It may not be to your disgraceâTake care Always, you be not infamousâIf needs That you must love, love before witnesses. PhÃ¦. What's that? Pal. Take heed that you proceed with caution. Phae. Does not live here a pandar? Pal. None forbids To purchase of him what's on sale, provided You have but wherewithal to pay for it. The publick road is free for all the world, If to get at it, you break down no fence; So from the married woman you abstain, The widow, virgin, and the free, why then Love where you list. PhÃ¦. This is the pandar's house. Pal. A curse light on it! PhÃ¦. Why? Pal. Because it serves So infamous a masterâ PhÃ¦. So! Revile! Pal. With all my heart I wish itâ PhÃ¦. Yet have done. Pal. Why, Sir, 'twas you yourself bade me go on. PhÃ¦. But now I bid you hold your tongueâWhat I Was going to say, is thisâThere's a young maidenâ Pal. Belonging to the pandar who lives hereâ PhÃ¦. You have it rightâ Pal. The less am I in danger Of dropping itâ PhÃ¦. Intolerably saucy! He fain would make a courtezan of her. But, as she loves me ev'n to desperation, I'd have her to myself. Pal. How's that? PhÃ¦. I'd have her My own, I say; because I love her too. Pal. This same clandestine love's a wicked thing: 'Tis utter ruin. PhÃ¦. Troth, 'tis as you say. Pal. Say, has she enter'd yet the lists of love? PhÃ¦. As far as I'm concern'd, chast as my sister; Unless a kiss or two has made her otherwise. Pal. Ever remember this. Flame follows close Upon the heels of smoke. In smoke, indeed, Things cannot be consum'd, in flame they may. He that would have the kernel, breaks the nut-shell. Who would debauch a girl, begins with kissesâ PhÃ¦. But she's quite modest: nor to any man Has yet allow'd her favoursâ Pal. All this talk I could believe, if modesty and pandars Could live together. Phae. Judge of her yourself.â When she has had an opportunity Of stealing off in private, she comes to me, Gives me a single kiss, and strait returns. The pandar being now sick, takes up his lodging In Ãsculapius' temple: and this gives her At present, th'opportunity again. That rascal tortures me. Pal. How?âWhat's the matter? PhÃ¦. One time he asks me thirty minÃ¦ for her, Another, a great talent.âNor yet can I From him get any dealing that is fair. Pal. You're wrong to think of getting from a pandar That which he has not in him. PhÃ¦. I've just sent My parasite to Caria, there to ask My friend to advance to me a sum of money By way of loan: which if he does not bring, I know not which way next I have to turn me. Pal. Pay your devotions to the Gods, and then, I think you'll turn you towards the right. PhÃ¦. Behold Before the door, an altar rais'd to Venus. I've vow'd a breakfast to my Venus hereâ Pal. Do you give yourself to Venus for a breakfast? PhÃ¦. Myself and thee, and these. Pal. I see you mean To overload your Venus' stomach then? PhÃ¦. Give me the bowl, boy. Pal. What to do? PhÃ¦. Oh! that You soon shall know. There's an old harradan, Who us'd to lye before the door to guard it; The thirsty bawd is call'd here, Madam Vinous. Pal. Why, you speak of her, Sir, as of a flaggon, That us'd to hold rich wine of Chios in it. PhÃ¦. To say no more, she has a strong smack at wine. Soon as with wine I've sprinkled o'er the doors, You'll see, she'll smell me out, and open strait. Pal. Was it for her the bowl was hither brought? PhÃ¦. If you oppose it notâ Pal. I do, by Hercules! Wou'd he that brought it here had broke his neck; I thought it meant for us. PhÃ¦. Come, hold your tongue. If any's left, 'twill be enough for us. Pal. What river's that, be't e'er so full, the sea Cannot receive? PhÃ¦. Go with me to the door, And contradict me not, Palinurus. Pal. Willingly. PhÃ¦. Drink, lovely door, drink hard, and ever be [sprinkling the door with wine. Propitious to me. Pal. [to the door.] Would you like, sweet door, Olives, or capers, or some relisher? PhÃ¦. Rouse, rouse your portress hither to my call. Pal. You spill the wine.âWhat is it you're about? PhÃ¦. Away. Seeâhow the house is open'd to me! Not e'en a single creakâSweet hinge, thou charm'st me! Pal. Give it a kiss. PhÃ¦. Let us conceal our light, And noise. Pal. Be't so. [they stand apart. SCENE II. Enter BAWD. Bawd. 'Tis good old wine I scentâ The love I bear it draws me thro' the dark. Where'er it stands, 'tis near.âOh ho! I have it. All hail, my soul! joy of my Bacchus, hail! O how do I adore thy aged age! The smell of rich perfume's to thee a stink, Thou art to me my myrrh, my cinnamon, My rose, my saffron ointment, my sweet cassia, My perfume of Arabia; wheresoe'er Thou spread'st thy sweets, let me be buried there. But now thy scent has gratified my nose, Let in its turn my throat receive some joy. Yet, yet I feel thee notâWhy, where's the bowl? I long to touch it. Pour thy liquor in. Pour, till it guggle in my throatâThis way It went. I will pursue it here. PhÃ¦. It is A thirsty bawd. Pal. A little dry, or so. PhÃ¦. She's moderate. She takes off but a cup Nine gallon measure. Pal. 'Troth, by your account, The vintage of the year will scarce suffice herâ 'Tis pity but she had been whelp'd a spaniel; She has so good a nose. Bawd. What voice is that? PhÃ¦. I think I'll speak to the old jade. I'll strait Accost her. Stay. Come back, look at me, bawd. [to her. Bawd. Who's that commands? PhÃ¦. The god of wine, brave Bacchus. He brings a potion to you, who are hawking, Coughing, and parch'd with thirst; but half asleep, Shall make you quietâ Bawd. How far off it is? PhÃ¦. Behold this light. Bawd. I prithee mend thy pace. Come nearer to me. PhÃ¦. Health to you. Bawd. Can that be When I am parch'd with thirst? Pha. Ho! you shall drink This very moment. Bawd. Sure 'tis long a coming. PhÃ¦. Here, take it, merry dame. [giving her the bowl. Bawd. Your health, dear man, [drinking. Dear as my eyes. Pal. Quick, down with'tâin thy maw, Scour well thy sink with it. PhÃ¦. Peace, hold your tongue. No spiteful words. Pal. I'd rather act my spite to herâ Bawd. Venus, from little left, I give thee little, And that against my will. Your lovers, when They quaff and drink away, make their libations: Seldom so good a lot falls to my share. Pal. How greedily the jade sucks down the wine With open gullet? PhÃ¦. Now I'm at a loss! I know not how I shall begin with her. Pal. Tell her the very same you now told me. PhÃ¦. What's that? Pal. Why, that you are undone.â PhÃ¦. Confound you! Pal. Tell herâ Bawd. [after having drank.] Ah! Pal. Do you like it? Bawd. Very well, Sir. Pal. And I should like a goad to dig your sides with. PhÃ¦. Be quiet: hold your tongue. Pal. I say no more. See, see, the rainbow drinksâBy Hercules, I think 'twill rain to-dayâ Pha. Shall I now tell her? Pal. What would you tell her? PhÃ¦. That I am undone. Pal. Ay, tell her soâ PhÃ¦. Old woman, list to me. I'd have you know I'm ruin'd,âquiteâto death. Bawd. That's not my case; for, I'm just brought to life. But what's the reason that you tell me so? PhÃ¦. Because I'm not possess'd of what I love. Bawd. My PhÃ¦dromus, I beg you, weep not thus. Take you but care I thirst not, I'll take care, And bring you all you love.â [Exit. PhÃ¦. Keep faith with me, I'll not erect a golden statue; no, I'll plant a vine tree, as a monument Erected to your gullet. Who on earth, My Palinurus, shall like me be happy, If my dear girl comes to me? Pal. By my troth, The man that is in want, as well as love, Is indeed wretchedâ PhÃ¦. 'Tis not so with me. For I expect my parasite's return To-day with money. Pal. You attempt great things, If you depend on matters in the clouds. PhÃ¦. What think you? shall I now draw near the door, And sing a catch to it? Pal. Even as you pleaseâ I neither bid, nor yet forbid your lawsâ Your humours and your manners are so chang'd. PhÃ¦. Hear me, ye boltsâWith pleasure I salute ye. I wou'd, I wish, I beg you, lovely bolts, Propitious aid a lover. Lydians prove, Dance from your staples, and send forth my love! Who drinks my heart's best blood, and makes me wretched. See how they sleep, these sorry bolts, nor stir A step the faster upon my account. I see you treat my favour with contempt. But hist! hist! Pal. I am silent. What's the matter? PhÃ¦. I hear a noise. The bolts at last comply. SCENE III. Re-enter BAWD, leading in PLANESIUM. Bawd. Go softly forthâTake heed, my dear Planesium, The doors make not a noise, nor hinges creak, For fear my master hear what we're about. Stay, stay, I'll sprinkle some cold water on 'em. Pal. I like this palsied jade's prescription tho'â She's learn'd so much, to take the wine herself, And leave the water for the doors to drink. Pla. Come near, where art thou? You, who surety are For my recognizance to VenusâWhere? Who in her name thus cit'st me to appear? Behold me here. Being call'd, I make my appearance, And call on you to do the same. PhÃ¦. I'm here, My sweet; or else, I would submit to judgment. Pla. My soul! It is not meet for a true lover To be far distant from usâ PhÃ¦. Palinurus! O Palinurus! Pal. Why is it you call On Palinurus?âPray speak outâ PhÃ¦. You think she is Agreeableâ Pal. Too much soâ PhÃ¦. I'm a godâ Pal. A paltry god! PhÃ¦. What have you ever seen Nearer the gods, in happiness than I am? Pal. You're not in your right senses, that I see, And grieve to see. PhÃ¦. You grow impertinent; Be dumb. Pal. The man, who sees all that he loves, Nor yet enjoys it, while 'tis in his power, Is sure a self-tormentor. PhÃ¦. Well he chides me. There's nought on earth I have so long desir'd. Pla. Then take meâTo your arms Iâ PhÃ¦. This, this it is, That makes me fond of life. 'Tis this restraint Laid on you by your master, makes you dearer. Pla. Restraint? He never can restrain me from thee; Nor shall, 'till death shall separate our souls. Pal. I cannot hold, but must give him a schooling. 'Tis good to love a little, and discreetly: 'Tis bad to love to a degree of madnessâ But 'tis my master's case to be in love PhÃ¦. Let kings their kingdoms keep unto themselves, The rich their richesâLet each man enjoy His own, his honours, virtues, duels, battles, So they with envy look not on my joysâ Pal. Sir, have you vow'd to watch this night to Venus? 'Twill soon be break of day, by Pollux' temple! PhÃ¦. Peace! hold your tongue! Pal. Why should I hold my tongue! Unless that you may sleepâ PhÃ¦. Well, I'll to sleep. Make not so great a noise. Per. [aside.] Undone! by Hercules! What's this I learn? Epi. The truth.âOn hearing this I edg'd myself a little nearer to them As if the crowd had push'd me on that way. Per. I understand you.â Epi. But, how know you this? Said t'other, tell me who 'twas told you so? She had a letter from him but this day, This very day, said she, a letter came That he had taken up money of a banker At interest; that he had it in his hands, And brought it with him for that very purpose. Per. Yes, yes, 'tis over with me. Epi. Then she added, She had it from the girl herself, as well As from the letter. Per. What's now to be done? I must advise with my ApÃ¦cides. Apoe. We've nothing else to do, but to find out Some feasible expedient, piping hotâ For if the young man is not here already, He will be very soon, by Hercules! Epi. Wer't not to seem more wise than both my masters, I could propose a clever project, which, In my opinion, you would both approve of. Per. What is't, Epidicus? Epi. And feasible Enough. Apoe. Why dost delay to speak it then? Epi. You've wiser heads than I; do you speak first, I'll give you my opinion afterwards. Apoe. Psha! prithee tell us. Epi. No, you'll laugh at me. Apoe. No, in good truth. Epi. Well, if you like the project Put it in practice; if you approve it not, Find out a betterâI nor sow nor reap Ought for myself; my whole concern's for you. Per. Thank you for that: but let us know your scheme. Epi. Find out a wife directly for your son; And wreak your vengeance on this musick-girl, He's all for freeing, who debauches him; Nor ever give her freedom while she lives. Apoe. That's right, as can be. Per. I'm for any measure So that the thing be done once. Epi. Never fearâ Now is the time, e're he arrives, to do it: To-day's our own, as he'll be here to-morrow. Per. How know you it? Shall we thus ever love; and but express Our love as now clandestinely, by stealth? PhÃ¦. By no means. 'Tis four days since I dispatch'd My parasite to Caria, to procure Some money: He'll be here this very day. Pla. Time much too long you take, contriving means. PhÃ¦. May Venus never be propitious to me, If you are three days longer in this house, Before I make you free! Pla. Do as you say. Before I go, this kiss. [kisses him. PhÃ¦. Should any one Now offer me a kingdom, I'd not take it With greater pleasure. Say, when shall I see you? Pla. When will you make me free? answer that question. Ask not of me: but if you love me, buy me. Be sure bid what he'll not refuseâAdieu! [Exit. PhÃ¦. Quit me so soon! I die, my Palinurus. Pal. And Iâwith blows and want of sleep! PhÃ¦. Then follow me. [Exeunt. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter CAPPADOX from the temple of ÃSCULAPIUS. CAPPADOX. Since I perceive what Ãsculapius means, I am resolv'd forthwith to quit his temple. Too well I find he pays me no regard: Nor is dispos'd to cure meâFor my health Declines apace, my malady gets ground. I walk as I were girdled with my spleen; And look as if my belly carried twinsâ Wretch that I am! I fear me I shall burstâ Enter PALINURUS [speaking to PHÃDROMUS within] Pal. You would do well, Sir, would you list to me, And bannish from your mind this anxious sorrow. You doubt your parasite's return from Caria. 'Tis my opinion, he will bring the money. For if he bring it not, no chain's so strong To hold him from his crib to eat with you. Cap. Who's talking here? Pal. What voice is this I hear? Cap. 'Tis Palinurus sure, the slave of PhÃ¦dromus. Pal. What man is this, with this club-paunch, and eyes As green as grass! I know his figure sure, But his complexion puzzles me. Oh!âNow I know him well; 'tis the procurer Cappadox. I will accost himâ Cap. Save you, Palinurus! Pal. Ha! is it you, the chief in all bad pranks? Save you!âHow fares itâ Cap. I am just aliveâ Pal. That's just as much as you deserveâBut what Is it that ails you? Cap. Why; I'm kill'd with spleen, My reins are painful, and my lungs are torn, My liver is in torment, and my heart-strings Are crack'd, and all my small guts full of pain. Pal. Then your complaint is of the royal sort. Cap. An easy matter 'tis, to jeer the wretched! Pal. I'd have you hold out still a few days longer, 'Till your intestines 'gin to putrifyâ For if you now go off, while yet their salting Has not lost all its virtue, your intestines May fetch a greater price than will yourself. Cap. Ay, but my spleen, I say's truss'd upâ Pal. Then walkâ That's best for all disorders of the spleenâ Cap. Truce with your raillery, and answer me To what I ask. I've had a dream to night: If I should tell it you, can you expound it? Pal. I am the only man who knows that art: The interpreters of dreams all come to me In consultation; and when I have answer'd, Abide by my opinion.â SCENE II. Enter COOK. Cook. Palinurus, Why this delay? Why don't you set me out The things I want; that our keen parasite, When he comes back, may find his dinner ready. Pal. You'll wait 'till I interpret him his dream? Cook. Whene'er you dream yourself, you apply to me. Pal. 'Tis true. Cook. Go then, and look me out what's necessary. Pal. AgreedâMean time then, tell your dream to him. I warrant him more skilful than myself: For what I know, I know it all from him. Cap. Let him attend to meâ Pal. He willâ Cap. He is, What few slaves are, obedient to his masterâ Mark me thenâ Cook. WellâTho' you're unknown to me. Cap. This night I dream'd, that Ãsculapius sat At distance from me: nor did he approach Nor seem to heed meâ Cook. O! this signifies That all the other gods will do the like. In truth, there is among them but one mind. No wonder, if it fares no better with you. Better you'd pass'd the night in great Jove's templeâ He spar'd you, when you invok'd him to a falsehood. Cap. If all who take false oaths were to sleep thus, The capitol itself would not contain them. Cook. Attend then: and to Ãsculapius sue For peace, lest some misfortune happen to you, Such as has been foreboded in this dream. Cap. You counsel well.âI'll go into the temple, And ask his favourâ Cook. May he never grant it! Pal. Immortal gods! who is it there I see? Is't not the parasite I sent to Caria? PhÃ¦dromus, haste; come forth, come forth, I say. Enter PHÃDROMUS. PhÃ¦. What noise is this? Pal. See, see, your parasite Coming this way at farther end o'the street. Let's step aside, and list what he's aboutâ PhÃ¦. I think you're in the rightâ SCENE III. Enter CURCULIO. Cur. Known or unknown, Make way, while I do my commission here: Fly all, begone, and quit the way to me, Lest in my speed, with elbow, breast, knee, head, I some one hurt; I am so charg'd with business Of diligence and speed; no man whatever, Let him be e'er so rich, let him be king, Or general, let him be clerk o'the market, Sheriff or headborough in all his glory, Shall stand before me, if he stops my wayâ And those cloak'd Grecians, who stalk gravely on, With their heads cover'd, and their laps quite cramm'd With booksâThey carry baskets with them too. They stop the runaways, and chatter still Their wise opinionsâAt each tippling house You see them topingâThere they hide their heads, And as they steal their liquor, drink it hotâ Then with great gravity, and half seas over, They sally forth: but, if I meet with them, I'll make them send their barley-broth out backwards. The slaves too of buffoons, who play in th'streets, The throwers and the catchers of the ball, All to the ground I fell.âWhy, let 'em keep At home, and by that means avoid the danger. PhÃ¦. [aside.] If this same fellow were our governor, He shews what he'd be at. Such are our manners; And such slaves now: 'tis well he wants the means To put the thing he knows so well, in practice. Cur. Is there none here, can tell me where to find My patron PhÃ¦dromus? my business hastes, And I must meet with him as soon as possible. Pal. He's seeking you.â PhÃ¦. Suppose we join himâHo! Curculio! Here! 'Tis you I wantâ Cur. Who calls me By name? PhÃ¦. One who has wish'd to meet with you. Cur. You could not more than I have wish'd for you. PhÃ¦. O my commodious, necessary, long'd for Curculio, save you! Cur. Save you tooâ PhÃ¦. How stand My hopes?âSpeak outâI beg you tell me allâ Cur. Speak out, I pray, and tell me how stand mine. PhÃ¦. What is the matter? Cur. Oh! my eyes grow dim, My knees are weak with hungerâ PhÃ¦. Wearinessâ Cur. Support me, hold me up, I beg of you.â PhÃ¦. See you, how pale he looks? a seat here quickly; Go bring a ewer with waterâHast, be quickâ Cur. I'm sick at heartâ PhÃ¦. Would you some water? Cur. Noâ A bit to eatâI'd swallow't in a momentâ PhÃ¦. A plague confound you! Cur. Give me, I beseech you, On my arrival, some refreshment? PhÃ¦. Yes, It shall be done. [fanning him.] Cur. What is it you're about? PhÃ¦. Why, giving you refreshment. Cur. No, I want not Refreshment quite so airy. PhÃ¦. Why, what then? Cur. I want to eat; 'tis that, on my arrival Must welcome me. PhÃ¦. May Jove, and all the Gods Confound you! Cur. I'm quite spent, I scarce can see, My mouth is bitter, and my teeth are rusty, My jaws for want of exercise, are grown Quite clammy, and my guts quite lank thro' emptiness. PhÃ¦. Well, by-and-by then, you shall eat a morsel. Cur. None of your morsels, I'm for a full meal. PhÃ¦. Did you but know what is reserv'd for you? Cur. I wish I knew but where: my teeth want much To find it out. PhÃ¦. A ham; a fat sow's paunch, With paps and kernels. Cur. What, all these?âPerhaps You mean i'th'marketâ PhÃ¦. In the dish, I tell you, And ready for you, since we heard the news Of your arrival. Cur. Don't play tricks with me. PhÃ¦. As I could wish the girl I love, lov'd me, I do not lye. But I hear nothing yet Of the affair on which you were dispatch'd. Cur. I have brought back nothing. PhÃ¦. Then am I undone. Cur. I could find something, if you'll have but patience. According to your order, I set out, Arriv'd at Cariaâthere I saw your friend. I ask him to make up the sum you wanted. He'd have you think him willing to oblige you, Nor would he disappoint youâas becomes Friends to be willing to assist each otherâ But answer'd in few words, and faithfully; That he, like you, was in great want of money. PhÃ¦. Your words are daggersâ Cur. Nay, I'm saving you, And I will have you sav'dâUpon this answer, I left him, and went thence unto the Forum, Pensive to think my errand was in vain. By accident I there espy'd a captain. Him I accost with salutationsâHe Returns the complimentâThen takes my hand, Draws me apart, and asks me, Why at Caria? I tell him, I came thither for amusement. Says he, In Epidaurus do you know Lyco the banker?âYes, says I, I do.â And know you the procurer Cappadox? Says heâO, ay, I yearly visit him.â But what of him?âBecause I bought of him A girl for thirty minÃ¦; and her cloaths, And jewels for ten minÃ¦ moreâThe money, Says I, have you yet paid him? It is lodg'd In Lyco's hands, the banker that I spoke of: I order'd him, that when he should receive A letter from me, seal'd with my own ring, He strait should take the girl, her cloaths and jewels From the procurerâHaving heard his story, I left himâStrait he calls me back; invites me To sup with himâMy conscience would not let me Refuse his offerâThen, says he, suppose We go, and take our places at the table. The motion pleas'd meâFor it suits not me To lengthen out the day, nor injure night Of her due rights, defrauding herâIn short, All was prepar'd, and we ourselves not wanting. When we had eat and drank, he took the dice, And challeng'd me to playâI stake my cloak; And he his ringâand then invok'd Planesium. PhÃ¦. My mistress? Cur. Peace a whileâHe threw deuce-ace. I take the dice: invoke my patron Hercules! And throw a princely cast. Then drink to him In a large cup of wine. He drinks it up, Reclines his head, and sleeps. I slily draw From him his ring; and steal from off the couch, For fear the captain see me. Whither going? The slaves then askâWhy, whither all men go, Who've made an hearty mealâAs soon as e'er I saw the door, I took me to my heels. PhÃ¦. I praise you. Cur. Praise me, when I've done your job! Come, come, let's in, and sealâ PhÃ¦. Do I delay you? Cur. But first for this same ham, kernel and paps. A good foundation for the belly these. Bread, bumpers, beef, and a capacious pot. These will supply good counsel: while you seal, He'll wait, and I shall eat. I'll dictate to you What you shall writeâFollow me in. PhÃ¦. I follow. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter LYCO. LYCO. I find I'm a good man.âI've struck my balance, And see, by what's in hand, and what I owe, If I pay not my creditors, I'm rich; But if I clear with them, I'm deep in debtâ 'Troth, when I seriously consider this, If I am press'd, I'll break, and e'en submit; And let them carry me before the PrÃ¦tor. 'Tis what most bankers do; borrow of one, Or of another, but to none repay; But if one ask it in a higher tone, They then discharge the debt in cuffs. The man, Who in good time gets rich, must in good time Be provident, or in good time will starve. I fain would buy a boy, who may be wanted, For hire; my present want is only moneyâ Enter CURCULIO, [speaking to PHÃDROMUS within.] Cur. Now my skin's full, put me in mind of nothing: I recollect and know it allâThen peaceâ I'll give a good account of my commission. I have fill'd me well within; and yet have left A little corner in my stomach void, Where I may hoard the remnants of these remnants. But who is this saluting Ãsculapius, With his head cover'd? 'Tis the very man I am in search of. Follow me, [to PhÃ¦d.] I'll make As if I knew him not. Hola! Hola! 'Tis you I want. Lyc. Good day, you single-peeper. Cur. Why, single-peeper? Do you mean to jeer me? Lyc. You must be of the family of Cocles, They all were single-peepers. Cur. This poor eye Was by a catapulta lost at Sicyon. Lyc. Or so, or by some broken pot of cinders, What is't to me? Cur. The fellow is a witch. He has hit the markâThat was the catapulta, I'm oft saluted with. [aside.] I prithee, youngster, No sneers upon this honourable mark, Gain'd in the publick service, lest I cite you, And incommitiateâ Lyc. You may forumnize, If you don't incommitiate me. Cur. No more Of forum or comitia, if you love me; They are not to my tooth. But if you'll shew me The man I want, I shall be much oblig'd; Lyco the banker. Lyc. Why you look for him, And whence, say, are you?â Cur. From the captain, I. Therapontigonus Platagidorus. Lyc. I recollect the name, for when I write it, It fills compleat four pagesâbut what wants he? Cur. He's charg'd me with this letter. [shewing a letter. Lyc. Who are you? Cur. I am his freed-man, and they call me Nimwell. Lyc. Well, save you, NimwellâBut, I prithee now, Why Nimwell? Sayâ Cur. Because, when drunk, asleep, (As I pretend) I Nim the vestments well. 'Tis not without a reason, I'm call'd Nimwell. Lyc. Then e'en for entertainment seek elsewhere, You meet with none from me. I want no Nimwells. But I'm the man you seek. Cur. Are you indeed The banker Lyco? Lyc. Ayâthe very man. Cur. Therapontigonus has order'd me To give you salutation, and this letter. Lyc. Me? Cur. You. Here, take itâ[gives a letter.] Be acquainted with The seal. D'ye know it. Lyc. Yes, I ought to know it. A man arm'd with a shield, and with a sword, Killing an elephant. Cur. He order'd me, To beg you, do directly what he writes, If you'd oblige him. Lyc. Step aside, I'll see What 'tis he writes. Cur. E'en as you please for that, So that I take of you the charge I seekâ Lyc. [reading.] âTherapontigonus Platagidorus, âThe captain, to his host in Epidaurus âLyco, sends greeting. Cur. [aside.] Yes, the man's my own, He has devour'd the hook. [aside.] Lyc. [reading.] âI here desire âAnd beg you to deliver to the person âWho brings this letter to you, the young girl âI bought when you was by, and by your means; âWith her, her cloaths and jewels. You well know, âHow 'twas agreedâThe money to the pandar, âThen pay; the girl deliver to the bearerâ. But where's your master? Why not come himself? Cur. I'll tell you, Sir. 'Tis but four days ago, That we arriv'd from India safe at Caria. Where he has order'd to erect a statue Of pure and solid Philippean gold, Seven feet in height: this for a monument Of his exploits. Lyc. And wherefore? Cur. That I'll tell you. Because that he alone in twenty days Subdu'd the Persians, and the Paphlagonians, The Synopeans, Arabs, and the Carians, The Cretans and the Syrians. Rhodes and Lycia, Peredia and Perbibesia, Centauromachia, Classia, Unomammia, Lybia, and all the coast of Centerobromia, And the whole half of all the nations there. Lyc. O rare! Cur. You seem surpriz'd? Lyc. For if these people Were all penn'd up, like chicken in a coop, 'Twould take a year to encompass them about. By Hercules! you must be master's man, You spit such wonders forth. Cur. I'd tell you more, If more you chooseâ Lyc. I have no doubt. Here, followâ I will dispatch the affair you came about. And see, our man!âHealth and long life to you! Enter PROCURER. Pro. May the Gods love you! Lyc. Do you know the business I come to you about? Pro. You've but to tell me. Lyc. To take the money for the girl you wot of, And send her off with him [pointing to Curculio.] directlyâ Pro. What! The girl I promis'd to give up to PhÃ¦dromus? Lyc. What's that to you, so you receive the money? Pro. A good adviser's to the full as good As an assistantâCome onâFollow me. Cur. Take care, procurer, not to make me wait. [Exeunt.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter Master of the Wardrobe, as Chorus. MAST. CHOR. 'Troth, PhÃ¦dromus has got an arch rogue there; A sly informerâBut by sea or land Rather, I know not which I should pronounce him. I fear I shan't get back the dresses lent him. No matter! I have nought to do with him, I trusted them to PhÃ¦dromus. However, I'll keep a watchful eye. 'Till he comes out, Lest you should take unnecessary trouble, [to the spectators. I'll shew you where to find all sorts of men, Or bad or good, or honest men or rascals. Whoe'er wants one to swear through thick and thin, I send him to law-courtsâA lying boaster You'll find not far from Cloacina's altar. Your prodigal rich husbands you must look for At the Exchange. There too you'll find stale harlots, Ready for any bargain. Stewards of clubs Are ever at the fish-markets. Your rich, Your good men, at the bottom of the Forum. In th'middle you shall have, near the canal, Meer braggarts, bold, loquaciousâ'Bove the lake, Malevolent and foul-mouth'd fellows, such As boldly deal out slander without cause: Yet give sufficient matter unto others, To form true accusations against them. At the old shops, are those who lend out money, Or borrow it, on usuryâBehind The temple of Castor, those you'll not trust easily.â In Tuscan street are such as sell themselves, The baker, butcher, or the augurer. In the oil-market, those who cheat mankind, Or lay it in men's way to cheat themselves. In th'Oppian Leucadia, are rich husbands, Who, by extravagance are now reduc'd To poverty. But hark! the door there creaks! 'Tis time, it seems, for me to hold my tongue. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter CURCULIO, leading in PLANESIUM, LYCO and CAPPADOX. Cur. Maiden, go on beforeâFor what's behind me I can't observe. Her jewels and her cloaths, The captain said, and every thing she had, Were his. Cap. Why, who denies it? Cur. Not amiss I should remind you tho'. Lyc. Remember too Your promise, that if any one lay claim To her as free, the money be return'd, The thirty minÃ¦. Cap. As to that be easy: I shall remember itâand now repeat it. Cur. I'd have you to remember the same thing. [to Cappadox. Cap. I do: and give you warrant for'tâ Cur. What warrant. From a procurer? You're a set of people Who nothing have but one poor tongue, on oath What's trusted to them to deny! Some slaves You sell, to others give their liberty. Some you command; and none of these your property. No man will give security for you, Nor your security will any take. The race of pandars are, in my opinion, Such, among men, as flies, gnats, lice and fleas, Teazing, and mischievous, and troublesome, But good to none. Nor dares an honest man Be seen with them in publickâIf he shou'd, He is despis'd and blam'd, and spit upon: If ne'er so innocent, they cry him down, As cheated of his fortune and his fame. Lyc. Methinks, my witty blinkard seems to know them! Cur. Nay, nay, by Hercules! I place you bankers In the same rank. You're like them perfectly. They sell themselves in private, you i'th'Forum. You ruin men with usury, and they With their bad counsel and debauchery. How many statutes have the people ask'd Against you bankers, which when made, you've broke? Some hole is always found, where to creep out. As boiling water soon grows cold, you thus Judge of the laws. Lyc. Better I'd held my tongue. Cap. You have been studying it, and are sharp upon us. Cur. If I reflect on him, who don't deserve it, I own it evil speaking.âIf he does, I think 'tis speaking wellâYour warranty I ne'er shall take, nor any other pandar'sâ Would you ought else with me? [to Lyco. Lyco. Nought but farewel. Cur. The same to you. Cap. Hark you! to you I speak. [to Curculio. Cur. Say what you'd have. Cap. I prithee, take good care Of this young woman, that no ill betide her. I've brought her up in my own family With modesty and care. Cur. If so concern'd, What will you give me to take care of her? Cap. The gibbet. Cur. That's what you yourself deserve. Cap. [to Plan.] Why do you weep, you simpleton? fear not: I've sold you well, by Hercules! Take care You shew yourself a good and modest girl. Now fairly go along with him, my fair one. Lyc. Well, Nimwell, any more commands with me? Cur. Farewell, and health attend you. You've most kindly Giv'n me at once your money, and your pains. Lyc. My greetings to my patron. Cur. I'll not fail. [Exit with Plan. Lyc. Procurer, would you ought? Cap. I should be glad To have those minÃ¦ that are left; they'd be Of service to me, till my own affairs Are in a better posture. Lyc. You shall have them. Ask them of me to-morrow. [Exit. Cap. As the affair Is so well over, I'll into the temple, And return thanks. I purchas'd her a girl, And at ten minÃ¦ only, long ago; And him, who sold her, ne'er set eyes on since. He may be deadâbut what is that to me? I have the money.âWho to the gods is dear, Him they indulge with gain. I now will haste To my devotionsâand take care of one. [Exit. SCENE III. Enter THERAPONTIGONUS and LYCO. The. I'm in no little passion, but enrag'd, As oft I've felt at sacking of a city. Pay me this instant, pay the thirty minÃ¦ I left with you, or hast to leave your life. Lyc. No little mischief would I do to you, But use you, as the man deserves, that asks A debt I owe not. The. Be not so stout with me, Nor think that I will stoop to beg it of you. Lyc. Nor shall you ever force me to repay What I've already paid. I will not do'tâ The. 'Troth, when I left the money in your hands, I did suppose you would return me nothing. Lyc. Then why do you ask it of me now? The. Because I want to know, to whom you paid the money. Lyc. Why, to your freed-man, to a one-eye'd fellow, Who said his name was Nimwell; 'twas to him I paid it; and he brought this letter from you, [giving a letter. Seal'd with your seal. The. What letter! what freedman, One-eye'd, do you prate of to me in your dreams? What Nimwell do you mean? I have no freedman. Lyc. The wiser you; unlike to those marauders, Who free their slaves, and leave them to be starv'd. The. What is't you've done? Lyc. Done honour to your letter: Done as you charg'd meâI receiv'd your messenger, Receiv'd the man who brought your seal's impression. The. O worse than fool, to give that letter credit! Lyc. Shou'd I not credit what is us'd in matters Publick and private? But I go my way. Your money was well paid. Soldier, farewel. The. Say you farewel? Lyc. Fare ill then, if you choose itâ And all your life, for me! [Exit. The. What's now to do? Is't nothing then, that I've made kings obey, When such a paltry fellow scorns me thus? SCENE IV. Enter CAPPADOX. Cap. The man to whom the Gods propitious are, They can't be angry with.âAfter the sacrifice It came into my head to ask the banker, Lest he should take't in mind to run away, To pay me the remainder of the money, That I may rather make good cheer, than he. The. Did you not hear me wish you a good day? Cap. Therapontigonoplatagidorus! save you! I'm glad to see you safe in Epidaurus. You will not pick a bit with me to-day? The. Why, your reception's civil, I must own! But you will find a different one from me. [aside. How fares my purchase at your house? [to him. Cap. You've nought At my house now. Nay, call not witnesses: I owe you nothing. The. What! Cap. I've done as I Had sworn to do. The. Will you return the girl, Or no; before I spit you with my sword, You rascal? Cap. I shall make you laugh, and on The wrong side of your mouth. Nay, fright not me, She's carry'd offâas you shall be yourself, If you persist in thus abusing me. I owe you nothing, but a cord to hang you. The. And dare you threaten me! Cap. Not only threaten, But I will put my threats in execution, If you persist in being troublesomeâ The. What! threatned thus! by a procurer too! All my set battles disregarded thus? So may my sword and buckler never do me Good service in the field, unless the girl Deliver'd be, I'll mince thee in such bits, The ants shall piecemeal carry thee away. Cap. So may my nippers, crisping-irons, combs, And glass be good, my cloth and scissars clean, As I regard your threats and swelling words, No more, than the poor wench, that cleans my privy. I sent the girl by him, who brought your money. The. And who is he? Cap. Your freedmanâsaid his name Was Nimwell. The. Mine?âNow I perceive the cheatâ By Hercules! Curculio stole my ring. Cap. And have you lost your ring? You are a soldier Finely enroll'd in a disbanded corps! The. But where to find this weevil? Cap. In your wheat. There you'll five hundred find instead of one. Well, I'll awayâYour servant!âFare you well. [Exit. The. Fare well! Fare ill to you. What shall I do? Shall I stay here or go? And have I been Impos'd on in this manner? I would give A good reward to him who'd find him out. [Exit. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter CURCULIO, with a ring. CURCULIO. I have been told, that in some Tragedy, An antient poet has observ'd, two women Are worse than one.âThe thing is really so. And yet I never saw, nor ever heard of; There can't be told of, nor can be imagin'd A slier woman, or a craftier jade Than this same mistress is of PhÃ¦dromus. Soon as she saw that I had got this ring, She ask'd me where I had it. Why that question?â Because the question's of importance to me. Still I refus'd to tell her; so, to snatch it Forcibly, with her teeth, she seiz'd my handâ I'd much ado to gain the door, and fly. But see the slut herself. SCENE II. Enter PHÃDROMUS and PLANESIUM. Pla. My PhÃ¦dromus, Make haste. PhÃ¦. Why so? Pla. Why, lest your parasite Escape you. The affair's of consequence. PhÃ¦. I've no affairs but what I've seen an end of. Pla. Lay hold of him. PhÃ¦. Why so? Pla. Ask where he had That ring. My father wore it on his finger. Cur. So did my aunt. Pla. My mother gave it him To wearâ Cur. And so your father, he transferr'd it To youâ Pla. You trifleâ Cur. So I'm us'd to doâ 'Tis my vocation, and my livelihoodâ But what's the matter? Pla. Would you hinder me From finding out my parents? Cur. What, d'you think I've here conceal'd your father and your mother Within this ring? Pla. I'm a free woman born. Cur. And so were many others, who're now slaves. Pla. Upon my word, I'm angry. Cur. I have told you, And truly, how the ring came to my hands. How oft must I repeat the same? I tell you, I trick'd a captain, of the ring at dice. Enter THERAPONTIGONUS. The. So! safe's the word! See there the man I'm seeking. How now! good Sir! Cur. I hear youâWill you bet Your uniform on three casts of the dice? The. Go to the gibbet with your casts and dice. Return the money, or the girl. PhÃ¦. What money? What foolish stuff you talk? What girl d'you mean? The. Scoundrel, the girl you have brought off to-day From the procurer. PhÃ¦. I! I've brought off none. The. Surely I see her there! [pointing to Plan. PhÃ¦. This maiden's free. The. My servant free, when I ne'er made her so? PhÃ¦. Who sold her to you? Where did'st buy her? Say. The. I paid the money for her, by my banker; Which I will have return'd to me four-fold By you and the procurer. PhÃ¦. You who buy Maids stoln and freeâI cite you 'fore the judgeâ The. I shall not go. PhÃ¦. Do you think I can't have witnesses? The. Noâ PhÃ¦. Jove confound thee! May'st thou live intestate. Cur. And I can be a witness, I!â PhÃ¦. Come hither. [to Cur. The. A slave a witness!âTake care what you're doingâ Cur. Well, since you needs must know it, I am free. The. Come then before the judge. But first, take that. [striking him. Cur. Help, help me, fellow-citizens! The. Why bawl so? PhÃ¦. What right have you to strike him? The. 'Tis my will. [to Cur. PhÃ¦. Come nearer to meâ[to Cur.] ThereâI'll yield him upâ [to The. Now say no more. Cur. O save me, PhÃ¦dromus! PhÃ¦. Yes, as I would myself, and my good genius. I ask you, captain, where you had that ring, This parasite filch'd from you? Pla. By these knees, I beg you, satisfy us. The. What's that to you? You might as well ask, Whence this vest, this swordâ Cur. What blust'ring airs the braggart gives himself? The. Send but that fellow off, I'll tell you all. Cur. All he will say, is nothing to the purpose. Pla. Sir, I beseech you, satisfy my doubts. The. I'll tell you.âRiseâNow listen and attend. This ring was once Periphanes' my father's. Pla. Periphanes! The. He, just before he died, Gave it to me, his son, as right he should. Pla. O Jupiter! The. And then made me his heir. Pla. O filial love, as I have still preserv'd thee, Preserve me now!âMy brother, hail! The. How, how Shall I believe? If what you say be true, I prithee name your mother. Pla. 'Twas Cleobula. The. Your nurse?â Pla. Archestrata. She carried me Once through the feast of Bacchus, to the shew. Scarce had they come, and plac'd me in my seat, When a storm rose, that overset the scaffold. Amidst my tears, all trembling and dismay'd, A stranger bore me off, but half alive. How, I can't say. The. You recollect this bustle! Where is the man that carried you away? Pla. I know not; but have ever kept this ring, Companion of my fate. The. Give me to see it. Cur. What! are you mad, to let him have the ring? Pla. Pray, give me leave. The. O Jupiter! the same I sent you on your birth-day. Well I know it, Well as I know myself.âMy sister, hail! Pla. Hail, brother! The. May the Gods these wonders make Blessings to both!â Cur. To all of us, I hope. You, on your first arrival, having found [to The. A sister, ought for joy this night to feast us: To-morrow night, he'll give the nuptial supper. PhÃ¦. We promise. The. You be silent. [to Cur. Cur. When things fadge, I'll not be silent.âSoldier, you betroth her Unto my master: and I'll give the dower. PhÃ¦. What dower? Youâ Cur. That, long as I shall live, I be her guest. The. Rallying apart, by Hercules! You shall be welcome. And this pandar here Shall pay us thirty minÃ¦. PhÃ¦. On what score? The. Because he bound himself to me by promise; If any man asserted her free born, He wou'd, without a word, return the whole. PhÃ¦. Then let us to this pandar's. The. 'Tis agreed. PhÃ¦. But, one thing firstâand that regards me nearly. The. What's that? PhÃ¦. That you betroth your sister to me. Cur. Why this delay, to give her him to wife? The. If she consent? Pla. 'Tis my desire, my brother. The. Then be it so. Cur. That's well said. PhÃ¦. Do you, captain, Betroth this maid to be my wife? The. I do. Cur. And I engage to give you what I mention'd. The. Pleasant rogue!âBut sure the pandar's here, My cash-keeper in question's this way comingâ SCENE III. Enter CAPPADOX. Cap. Who say 'tis ill to trust to bankers, trifle,â 'Tis good and ill, as I have prov'd this day. The money ne'er refunded, one can't say They're ill entrusted with; for 'tis quite lost. Why, here's a fellow should have paid ten minÃ¦: When, after rummaging each banker's counter And nothing coming, I set up a clamourâ He'll go to lawâI was in desperate fear He would not pay it, but before the PrÃ¦tor. But friends were urgent, so he paid the money At homeâAnd now I'll homeward hast myself. The. Hola! you pandarâStop, I want you. PhÃ¦. Ay, I want you tooâ Cap. But I want neither of you. The. Stay where you are, and pay me back the money. Cap. Why, what have I to do with you, or you With me? The. This day I'll make a javelin of you; And, like a catapulta, throw you off Quick from the string. PhÃ¦. No, you're too delicate For that: I'll make you lie down with a dog, I mean a dog of iron. Cap. And both of you In a strong prison made of heart of oak, Will I confine, to stay there till you rot. The. Seize him by the throat, and to the gallows with him! [meaning Cappadox. PhÃ¦. No needâHe'll voluntarily go thitherâ Cap. Immortal Gods! what! seize me uncondemn'd, Unheard! Planesium, help meâPhÃ¦dromus?â Pla. My brother, do not ruin him by law; I do beseech you, for he us'd me well, While at his house, with modesty and care. The. 'Twas not by his good willâThank Ãsculapius, That you are honest. Had he been in health, He'd pack'd you off to any place that offer'd. PhÃ¦. Let's see, if I can settle this between youâ Sir, let him goâProcurer, come you hitherâ I will determine it, so you'll abide By my decision. Cap. We refer to you; So you decree I'm nothing out of pocket. The. That which you promis'd?â Cap. Promis'd? PhÃ¦. He had your word. Cap. My word's against him now.âI now deny it. Speech was for use, nor giv'n me for my loss. The. He triflesâseize the fellow by the throat. Cap. Well, wellâI'm ready to obey your orders. The. Then since you are an honest man, make answer To what I ask. Cap. Then ask me what you please. PhÃ¦. Did you not promise, if 'twas made appear That she was free, you would return the money? Cap. I cannot well remember to have said so. The. Do you deny it?â Cap. Yes, by Hercules! Before whom? in what place? The. Before myself; And Lyco too, the banker. Cap. You'll not say so. The. Yes, but I will. Cap. I heed you not a rushâ Nay, fright not me. The. 'Twas done when I was present, And Lyco too, the banker. [to PhÃ¦. PhÃ¦. I believe you. And now attend, procurer, to my sentence. The girl is free. This man is prov'd her brother, [meaning The. And she's his sister: soon she'll be my wife; So pay the captain's money.âThat's my sentence. The. You'll lie in bonds unless you pay the money. Cap. By Hercules! you have not judg'd with equity: And you'll repent it, PhÃ¦dromus. For you, May all the Gods and Goddesses confound you! [to The. Follow me thenâ The. And whither? Cap. To my bankerâ That's to the PrÃ¦tor. For I always pay My debts 'fore him. The. I'll have you to the prison, Not to the PrÃ¦tor, if you don't repay it. Cap. I wish you hang'dâAnd now you know my mind. The. Indeed!â Cap. By Hercules! indeed. The. And I Am well acquainted with these fists of mine. Cap. What then? The. What then? d'ye ask? if you provoke me, I'll quickly make you quiet. Cap. Is it so? Then take your money. The. Wellâ PhÃ¦. And captain, you Sup with meâ'Tis my wedding nightâ The. May all End well to all!âSpectators, your applauseâ End of the Parasite.</field>
