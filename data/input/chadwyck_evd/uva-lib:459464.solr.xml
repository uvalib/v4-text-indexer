To which limits, when I had apted my inuention, and being to bring newes of them from the Sea, I induc'd Boreas, one of the winds, as my fittest Messenger; presenting him thus. In a robe of Russet and White mixt, full, and bagg'd; his haire and beard rough, and horride; his wings gray, and full of snow, and ycicles: his mantle borne from him with wyres, and in seuerall puffes; his feet So Paus. in Eliacis reports him to haue, as he was carued in arcâ Cipselli. ending in Serpents tayles; and in his hand a leaue-lesse Branch, laden with ycicles.

In the middest thereof was a seate of state, call'd the throne of beautie, erected: diuided into eight squares, and distinguish'd by so many Ionick pilasters. In these Squares the sixteene Masquers were plac'd by couples: behind them, in the center of the Throne was a tralucent Pillar, shining with seuerall colour'd lights, that reflected on their backes. From the top of which Pillar went seuerall arches to the Pilasters that sustained the roofe of the Throne, which was likewise adorn'd with lights, and gyrlonds; and betweene the Pilasters, in front, little Cupids in flying posture, wauing of wreathes, and lights, bore vp the Coronice: ouer which were placed eight Figures, representing the Elements of Beauty; which aduanced vpon the Ionick, and being females, had the Corinthian order. The first was SPLENDOR.

Amor whom I haue particularly followed, in this description. multitude of Cupids (chosen out of the best, and most ingenious youth of the Kingdome, noble, and others) that were the Torch-bearers; and all armed, with Bowes, Quiuers, Wings, and other Ensignes of Loue. On the sides of the Throne, were curious, and elegant Arbors appointed: and behinde, in the backe part of the Ile, a Groue, of growne trees laden with golden fruit, which other litle Cupids plucked, and threw each at other, whilst on the ground They were the notes of Louelinesse and sacred to Venus. See Phil. in that place, mentioned. Leuerets pick'd vp the bruised apples, and left them halfe eaten. The ground-plat of the whole was a subtle indented Maze: And, in the two formost angles, were two Fountaines, that ran continually, the one Of youth. Hebe's, the other Of pleasure. Hedone's: In the Arbors, were plac'd the Musicians, who represented the Shades of the olde Poets, and were attir'd in a Priest-like habit of Crimson, and Purple, with Laurell gyrlonds. The colours of the Masquers were varied; the one halfe in Orenge-tawny, and Siluer: the other in Sea-greene, and Siluer. The bodies and short skirts on White, and Gold, to both. The habite, and dressing (for the fashion) was most curious, and so exceeding in riches, as the Throne whereon they sat, seem'd to be a Mine of light, stroake from their iewels, and their garments. This Throne, (as the whole Iland mou'd forward, on the water,) had a circular motion of it owne, imitating that which wee call Motum mundi, from the East to the West, or the right to the left side. For so Hom. Ilia. M. vnderstands by ?????, Orientalia mundi: by ????????, Occidentalia. The steps, whereon the Cupids sate, had a motion contrary, with Analogy, ad motum Planetarum, from the West to the East: both which turned with their seuerall lights. And with these three varied Motions, at once, the whole Scene pio, shot it selfe to the land. Aboue which, the Moone was seene in a Siluer Chariot, drawne by Virgins, to ride in the clouds, and hold them greater light: with the Signe Scorand and the Character, plac'd before her. The order of this Scene was carefully, and ingeniously dispos'd; and as happily put in act (for the Motions) by the Kings Master Carpenter. The Painters, I must needs say, (not to belie them) lent small colour to any, to attribute much of the spirit of these things to their pen'cills. But that must not bee imputed a crime either to the inuention, or designe. Here the loud Musique ceas'd; and the Musicians, which were placed in the Arbors, came forth through the Mazes, to the other Land; singing this full Song, iterated in the closes by two Eccho's rising out of the Fountaines.

Which ended, Vulturnus the Wind spake to the Riuer Thamesis, that lay along betweene the shores, leaning vpon his Vrne (that flow'd with water,) and crown'd with flowers: with a blue cloth of Siluer robe about him: and was personated by Master Thomas Giles, who made the Daunces. VVLTVRNVS. Rise aged Thames, and by the hand Receiuie these Nymphes, within the land: And, in those curious Squares, and Rounds, Where with thou flow'st betwixt the grounds Of fruitfull Kent, and Essex faire, That lend thee gyrlands for thy hayre; Instruct their siluer feete to tread, Whilst we, againe to sea, are fled. With which the Windes departed; and the Riuer receiu'd them into the Land, by couples and foures, their Cupids comming before them. Their Persons were. The Qveene. La. Arabella. Co. of Arvndel.

Chichester. La. Walsingham. These dauncing foorth, a most curious Daunce, full of excellent deuice, and change, ended it in the figure of a Diamant, and so, standing still, were by the Musicians, with a second Song (sung by a loud Tenor) celebrated. [MUSICIANS.] Song. So beautie on the waters stood, (When loue had As, in the creation, he is said, by the ancients, to haue done. seuer'd earth, from flood! So when he parted ayre, from fire, He did with concord all inspire! And then a motion he them taught, That elder then himselfe was thought. Which thought was, yet, That is, borne since the world, and, out of those duller apprehensions that did not thinke hee was before.the child of earth, For loue is elder then his birth. The song ended; they danced forth their second dance, more subtle, and full of change, then the former; and so exquisitely performed; as the Kings maiestie incited first (by his owne liking, to that which all others, there present wish'd) requir'd them both againe, after sometime of dancing with the Lords. Which time, to giue them respite, was intermitted with song; first by a treble voyce, in this manner. Song. If all these Cvpids, now, were blind As is I make these different from him, which they fayne, cacum cupiaine, or pertulantem, as I expresse beneath in the third song, these being chaste Loues, that attend a more diuine beautie, then that of Loues commune parent, their wanton brother; Or play should put it in their mind To shoot at one another: What prettie battaile they would make, If they their obiects should mistake And each one wound his mother! Which was seconded by another treble; thus, It was no politie of court, Albee' the place were charmed, To let in earnest, or in sport, So many Loues in, armed. For say, the Dames should, with their eyes, Vpon the hearts, here, meane surprize; Were not the men like harmed? To which a tenor answer'd. Song. Yes, were the Loues or false, or straying; Or beauties not their beautie waighing: But here, no such deceipt is mix'd, Their flames are pure, their eyes are fix'd: They doe not warre, with different darts, But strike a musique of like harts. After which songs, they danc'd galliards, and coranto's; and with those excellent graces, that the musique, appointed to celebrate them, shew'd it could be silent no lorger: but by the first tenor, admir'd them thus, Song.

Here, they danc'd a third most elegant, and curious dance, and not to be describ'd againe, by any art, but that of their owne footing: which, ending in the figure, that was to produce the fourth, Ianvary from his state saluted them thus, IANVARIVS. Your grace is great, as is your beautie, Dames; Inough my feasts haue prou'd your thankfull flames. Now vse your seate: that seate which was, before, Thought stray'ing, vncertayne, floting to each shore, And to whose hauing For what countrey is it thinks not her owne beautie fayrest, yet? euery clime laid clayme, Each land, and nation vrged as the ayme Of their ambition, beauties perfect throne, Now made peculiar, to this place, alone; And that, by'impulsion of your destinies, And his attractiue beames, that lights these skies: Who (though with th'Ocean compass'd) neuer wets His hayre therein, nor weares a beame that sets.

At which they danc'd their last dance, into their Throne againe: and that turning, the scene clos'd with this full song. Song.
