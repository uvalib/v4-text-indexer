      <field name="fulltext">Enter for the Preface, a Lady very richly attyred, representing London, hauing two Angels before her, and two after her with bright Rapiers in their handes. London speaketh. Lo, Gentles, thus the Lord dooth London guard, Not for my sake, but for his owne delight: For all in vaine the Centonels watch and ward, Except he keepe the Citie day and night. Now may my foes in vaine both spurn and spight, My foes I meane, that London represent, Guarded from heauen by Angels excellent. This blessing is not my sole benefit, All England is, and so preseru'd hath bene, Not by mans strength, his pollicie and wit, But by a power and prouidence vnseene. Euen for the loue wherwith God loues our Queen: In whom, for whom, by whom we do possesse More grace, more good, than London can expresse. And that hath bred our plenty and our peace, And they doo breed the sportes you come to see, And ioy it is, that I enioy increase, My former fruites were louely Ladies three, Now of three Lords to talke is Londons glee. Whose deeds I wish may to your liking frame, For London bids you welcome to the same. Finis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter the three Lordes and their pages: First, Pollicie with his page Wit before him, bearing a shield: the ympreze, a Tortoys, the word, Prouidens securus. Next Pompe, with his page Wealth bearing his shield, the word, Glorie sauns peere: the ympreze a Lillie. Last, Pleasure, his page Wil, his ympreze, a Faulcon, the woord, Pour temps: Pol. attired in blacke, Pompe in rich roabes, and Pleasure in collours. Pollicie. Here I aduaunce my shield and hang it vp, To challenge him who euer dare denie, That one of those three London Ladies rare Ought not of right be matcht with Pollicie: A London Lord, the which I represent. Pom. And pomp prouides his challenge in his word, (Glorie sauns peere) claiming the one of them, Not by compulsion, but by common right, Yet maugre men my shield is here aduaunc'd For one matchlesse, a London Lady best Beseemeth Pompe (a London Lord) to haue. Plea. Pleasure hath soar'd as dooth his ympreze show, To looke alooffe on earthly Ladies all, Yet neuer could my curious eie discerne A Dame of woorth, for Londons Pleasures loue, But one, and she dooth shine as siluer Dooue. Of selfe bred soile, of London is her race, For whom in challenge I my shield aduaunce. Pol. Thus each in honor of his Mistresse And in regard of his wel daring mind, Hath here ymprizde the challenge of his right: But Lordings both, and brethren bred and sworne, A caution must be had in this conceit, That all our thoughtes aspire not to one heauen, Nor all our ships do saile for one selfe hauen, I meane that all our suites and seruices We tend and tender to one onely Dame, All choosing one, refusing th'other two. Pom. A great mislike amongst vs that might breede. Plea. I seeke but one and her vnto my selfe. Pom. And one wish I sauns partner of my loues. Pol. It stands with honour to be sole or none. Pom. Whom louest thou pleasure? Plea. Hearke ye. Whisper in his eare. Pom. Tush, ye lie. Wil. If my maister were a souldier, that word wold haue the stab. Wit. UUel Wil, stil you'il be a saucie Scab. pom. UUhy Pleasure? Pompe hath chosen Lucres loue. plea. UUhy pompe? But pleasure honors Lucre most. pol. And pollicie may Lady Lucre gaine Before you both: but let vs not contend, For Nemo dooth the Ladies prisoners keepe, Though they were slaundered late with Libertie And mariage to three farre borne Forriners. Then first it fits we practise their release, And see them, and by sight our liking place, For yet we loue as Gossips tell their tales, By hearsay: Fame, not Fauour hath vs yet enflam'd. pom. Lord pollicie with reason hath discust pleasure consent, and so our loue shall hold. ple. Ye neuer found that Londons Pleasure err'd From reason, or from pompe and pollicy. pol. Come on sir boy, attend you wel your charge, To his page Wit. UUait in this place to watch and ward this shield, If any man in honor of his loue, So hardy be with stroke of sword to attaint This shield, and challenge him that hereby challengeth, Say for thy Lord as should a trusty Page, That pollicie doth dare him to perfourme A hardier taske than common challengers. If he demaund what pollicy may be, A Lord of London say, one of the three. pom. And you (sir boy) for pompe perform the like, To Wealth. Bid him that dare this Ympreze batter once, Be well aduisde he be no beggers brat, Nor base of courage, nor of bad conceit: To match himselfe with such magnificence, As fits Lord pompe of London for his loue: Call if he come that can encounter me, Or mooue me not for ech enuious swad. plea. Will, be not wanton nor of waiward mood, To Will. Waite as doo these, vse faith and diligence, And marke him well that dare disdaine this shield, Which Londons Lord that pleasure hath to name, Hath here aduaunc'd in honor of his Dame. I bid thee marke him well, what e'er he be, That Londons pleasure dooth in malice scorne, For he's a Rascal, or a straunger borne. Good boy marke well his iesture and his looke, His eie, his gate, his weapon and attire, And dog him to his lodging, or his denne, For I will make him scomme and scorne of men, No better boy than Wil, when Wil is pleasde, Be pleasd my boy, and so be my good Wil. pol. And so good boyes farewel, look to your charge, Watch well good Wit, who scorneth Londons pollicy, Be warie Wit, for thou canst well discerne. pom. Wealth watch for pomp for thou canst wel defend plea. Wil can do something too when pleaseth him. Wit. Wil is a good boy where better is none. Exeunt the 3. Lordes. Wil. Nay Wit were the best boy if wil were gone. Wea. Nay wealth is the best boy, sirs let that alone. VVit. I wisse he saith true wil, this wealth's a gay lad, Wil. I care not for him, curmudgenly Swad. Wea. Wel, misse me a while &amp; you'il go neer to be sad. VVit. Wil, ye are wil-foole, if of him ye be not glad. VVil. Nay wit if thou want him, thou'ilt go neer to be mad. VVea. To keepe vs still quiet, I would other talke we had, VVit. I hope we'il not fall out being none but we three. Wea. If Wealth were away, Wit and Wil would agree. Wil. Nay, Wit and wil are at strife, when ther's no body but we. VVit. Let passe, and of our shields (sirs) let's make a litle glee, Wil, what giues thy maister here? a Buzzard or a Kyte. wil. Wit, you showe your selfe a Gentleman by gessing so right, A Buzzard? thou Buzyard, Wit, hast no more skil Then take a Faulcon for a Buzzard. Wit. O be quiet good Wil: It was but for sport, for I know the bird els, Wea. Thou mightest see it was no Buzzard man by the bels: wit. What's the reason of this Faulcon, I pray thee Will show. Wil. Thou knowst that a Faulcon soares hie, and stoupes low, So doeth pleasure. Wit. And what's the word? Wil. Pour temps, for time. Wit. A verie pretie one, I would it were in rime. Wea. In rime VVit, why so? Wit. Because it wantes reason. Wil. Looke for my fist VVit, if ye rap out such treason. VVit. Treason, to what, boy? Wil. To my maisters bird. Wit. Now Wil my thombe wags, it was but to his word. Wil. Tis a pleasant Gentleman, this yoong mast. Wit, Your maister hath something too, I pray ye what's it. VVit. Looke wil, and gesse. Wil. Tis a Toad in a shell. Wea. I had as leeue ye had said, a Frog in a well. VVit. Is't not a great Butterfly, Wil, canst thou tell? Wil. What is it in sadnesse? VVit. A Tortoys my boy, whose shell is so hard, that a loaden cart may goe ouer and not breake it, and so she is safe within, and wheresoeuer shee goes, she beares it on her backe, needing neither other succour or shilter but her shell: the woord vnderneath her is Prouidens securus, the prouident is safe, like to the Tortoys, armed with his owne defence, and defended with his owne armour: in shape somewhat rounde, signifying compasse, wherein alwaies the prouident forsee to keepe themselues within their owne compasse, my boy. wil. wittily spoken, now wealths maist. hath got a Daffadowndilly. VVea. If VVill had not bene wilfull, now he might haue saide a Lilly, whose glorie is without comparison, and beautie matchlesse, for Salomon the most sumptuous King that euer was, was neuer comparable in glorie with the Lilly, neither is ther any citties matchable with the pomp of London, mistake me not good boies, that this pompe tendes to pride, yet London hath ynough, but my Lord pomp doeth rightly represent the statelie magnificence and sumptuous estate without pride or vaineglorie to London accomodate, and therefore the woord is well applied to the ympreze (Glorie sauns peere) for that the Lillie is neither proud of the beautie, nor vainglorious of the pompe: No more is London, but if it be ioyful of any thing, it is of the peace and plentie, both flowing from two such fountaines as becomes not vs to name. Now therefore, my good boies, know that my Maister is rather Magnificence than pompe in bad sense, and rather pomp than Pride in the best sense. wil. And my Lord is not pleasure sprong of Uoluptuousnes, but of such honorable and honest kind conceit, as heauen &amp; humanitie wel brookes and allowes pleasure pleasing not pernitious. wit. Who would haue thought that wil had bene philosophous, But what means the word pour temps in the shield, for time? wil. Wit, shal I cal thee foole? the best pleasure of al lasts but a time, For of all pleasures most pleasing to sight, Mee thinks there is none to the Faulcons hie slight, Yet diseases end it, the breach of a wing, Nay, the breach of a fether spoiles that sweet thing: wit And so my maister hath the vantage wil ye or no, pomp and pleasure may be il. Wil. May not pollicy be bad? weal. Wit, wel ouertaken by VVil that craftie Lad. wit. A craftie Goose, the Gander giues him health, Bad pollici's seldome found in so Christian a common wealth, As London is I trust, where my maister is a Lord. wil. And ours so too. wea. Wel, let vs accord, for wit's a good thing, yet may be il appli'd wit. And so may wealth, be it imploied in pride, And wil worst of all, when it disdaines a guide. wil. A Iack an Apes hath wit. Wit. And so he hath Wil. Wea. But he neuer hath wealth: now ye are both still. Wit. Yes, he weares a chaine. Wil. Well spoke, and like a bearward. Wea. If ye be Non plus let the matter fall. Wil. Wit, dost thou see? thus goes wealth away with al. Wit. Let's reason no further for we shal haue glee, Here is a challenger to our shields, step we aside. Enter Simplicitie in bare blacke, like a poore Citizen. Wil. He will eate them I thinke, for he gapes verie wide. Wea. Say nothing to him, and ye shal see the foole goe by. Wil. Sirra, gape not so wide for feare of a flie. Simp. Fly, flam flurt: why? Can a flie doo hurt? Wit. Yea, haue ye not heard that the fly hath her spleene And the Ant her gall? Sim. My Uncle hath so I weene, for its an angrie old fellow When his gall runs ouer: children good day, Whose pretie lads are you three? Wit. Three, are ye sure? Sim. Ile not sweare till I haue told you: one, two, three. Wil. I beshrew thee. Sim. Mee boy, why? I am beshrewed already, for I am maried. Wea. Then thou hast a wife? Sim. Yea, I would thou hadst her, if thou couldst stay her tongue, Wea. I thy wife man? Why, I am too yoong. Sim. And I am too old, but in good ernest good boies, be not angry, that I cal you boies, for ye are no men yet, ye haue no beardes And yet I haue seene boies angrie for being called boies: Forsooth they would be called youths: wel, yet a boy is a boy And a youth is a youth: wel, if ye be not ashamed of the boy, Good boyes, whose boyes are ye? VVit. No whit ashamed sir of that that we are, nor ashamed at all of those whom we serue, for boyes we be, and as we be, we serue the three Lordes of London, to weet, pollicie, pompe, and pleasure. Sim. A pretie spoken Child and of a prety wit. VVil VVit's his name indeed, are ye one of his Godfathers, yee hit it so right? Sim. It is more then I know, then is thy name wit boy? Now of mine honestie welcome, for I haue wanted thee a great while. VVit. Welcome sir, how so? why do ye entertaine me so kindly? I cannot dwell with you for I haue a maister already. Sim. So haue I too, but she learnes me litle wit: my wife I mean UUel, al this while I stand heere my wares are not abroad, and so I may loose both my customers and market. VVea. UUares sir, haue ye wares? what wares do ye sell? Sim. Truely Child, I sel Ballades: soft, whose wares are these that are vp already? I paid rent for my standing, and other folkes wares shall be placed afore mine, this is wise indeed. VVit. O, the finenes of the wares (man) deserue to haue good place. Sim. They are fine indeed, who sels them, can ye tell? Is he free? VVit. Our maisters be, we wait on this ware, and yet we are no chapmen. Sim. Chapmen, no that's true, for you are no men, neither Chapmen nor chopmen, nor chipmen nor shipmen, but if ye be chappers, choppers or chippers, ye are but chapboyes, and chapboyes ye are double. VVil. Double, how is it? Teach me that and you wil make me laugh a litle. VVea. And me a litle: VVit. And me a litle: Sim. Then your three litle laughes will make one great laugh: VVit. True, for if three fooles were one foole, that were a great foole. But how are we double chapboies? Point to Simplicity. Sim. Because ye haue two chaps, an vpper chap and a nether chap. wil. Ha, ha, ha: wit. Ha, ha, ha: wea. Ha, ha, ha: simp. You said you would laugh but a litle, but you laugh a great deale, why doo ye laugh so much? wil. Because your wit was so great in expounding your meaning sim. Yee, you may see it is a good thing to haue wit. wit. I thanke you sir. wea. And what say you to wealth? sim. wealth? Marie wealth is better. wea. I thanke you sir. wil. And how say ye to wil? Sim. Indeed, good will is a great matter, wil. Yea betweene a maid and a bacheler. Sim. Why? you are not in loue boy? Wil. yes but I am, and in charity too. Sim. Charitie? alas poore child, thou in charitie, ha, ha, now must I laugh. wit. But you laugh a great while, and you laugh verie loud, Sim. Then I ow you nothing for laughing, &amp; you hear me the better Wea. But now laugh not we. Sim. No, you may be maddle, coddle: wel heres three passing fine lads, if a man were able to keep them all: let me see wealth, oh that's a sweet lad: then wit, oh that's a fine lad: Wil, oh that's a pretie lad. Wil, wit, and wealth, God lend yee health. I would I could guile their maisters of two of them. If I had Fraud here that serued Lady Lucre, he would teach me: he would teach me to tice one of them from his maister: which of them now, if a man should steale one? wil? Nay, I care not for wil outsep he be good wil: VVit, a pretie child, but a man can not liue by wit: wealth, yea marie sir, I would I could win that wealth, for then I need neither wil, nor wit, nor I need sell no Ballads but liue like a mouse in a mill and haue another to grinde my meale for me, Ile haue a fling at one of them anone. Wea. Do you not forget your selfe gaffar. wit. Haue you not wares to sell gaffar? wil. When doo you show gaffar? Sim. UUel remembred pretie lads, ye may see, children can teach old folks, I am an vnthrift indeed: wel, my wares shall out now. But sirs, how sell ye your wares, how many of these for a groat? wea. Our wares are not to be sold. sim. Not for siluer nor gold? why hang they then in the open market? wil. To be seene, not bought. Sim. Then they are like ripe plummes vpon a rich mans tree that set mens teeth a watering when they be not to bee bought: but what call ye these things? wit. Scutchions. Sim. Cushens, alas it were pittie to sit on such fine cushens: but come my boies if you'il buy any of my wares, her's my stall, and Ile open and show strait. VVea. What daintie fine Ballad haue you now to be sold? sim. Marie child, I haue chipping Norton a mile from Chappell othe heath, A lamentable ballad of burning the Popes dog: The sweet Ballade of the Lincoln-shire bagpipes, And Peggy and Willy, But now he is dead and gone: Mine own sweet Willy is laid in his graue la, la, la, lan ti dan derry, dan da dan, lan ti dan, dan tan derry, dan do. Wit. It is a dolefull discourse, and sung as dolefully. Sim. Why, you can not mend it, can ye? Wit What wil you lay on that? For I my selfe dare lay six groats to six of your balde Ballades, that you your selfe shall say I sing better than you. Sim. What a brag boy is this to comparison with a man, but boy boy, I will not lay six Ballades to six groates, but I will lay six Ballades to six ierkes at your buttockes, that you shall not sing so well as I. Wit. That I shall not? No, possible you wil not let me sing. Sim. I not let you? Is that spoken like wit? It is spoken like a Woodcocke, how can I stay thee if thou wilt sing out thy throat? Wit. Well then, to our bargaine, six Ballades to six stripes, and who shall keepe stakes? Sim. Neither of your companions, for that's aske my fellow if I be a theefe. Wil. Will you keepe the stakes your selfe? Sim. Best of all, for I meane plainely and will pay if I loose, her's my six Ballades, they bee ready: now how shall I come by your sixe stripes boy? Wit. Downe with your breeches, Ile fetch a rod and deliuer them straight. sim. Nay then I care not if thou keepe stakes. Wit. You speak too late gaffar, hauing challenged preheminence. sim. Then let's lay no wager but sing for good fellowship. Wit. Agreed, who shall begin? sim. O boy, who is the elder? Hast thou not heard giue Flounders to thy elder? Wit. You mistake the fish, trust me I am sure tis giue place, but begin with good grace. Here simp. sings first, and Wit after, dialoguewise, both to musicke if ye will. Wit. Now sirs, which singes best? Sim. Tush, your copesmates shal not iudge: friend, what say you, which of vs sings best? to one of the auditory. wil. To say trueth, ther's but bad choice, How wil you sel the ballad you sang, for Ile not buy the voice. Sim. Why wilt thou not buy my voice? wil. Because it wil cost me more money to buy sallet oile to keep it fr? rusting, than it is woorth: but I pray ye honest man, what's this? Sim. Read and thou shalt see. wil. I cannot read. Sim. Not read &amp; brought vp in London, wentst thou neuer to schole wil. Yes, but I would not learn. Sim. Thou wast the more foole: if thou cannot read Ile tel thee, this is Tarltons picture: didst thou neuer know Tarlton? Wil. No: what was that Tarlton? I neuer knew him. Sim. What was he: a prentice in his youth of this honorable city, God be with him: when he was yoong he was leaning to the trade that my wife vseth nowe, and I haue vsed, vide lice shirt, waterbearing: I wis he hath tost a Tankard in Cornehil er nowe, if thou knewest him not I wil not cal thee ingram, but if thou knewest not him, thou knewest no body: I warrant her's two crackropes knew him. Wit. I dwelt with him. Sim. Didst thou? now giue me thy hand, I loue thee the better. Wil. And I too sometime. Sim. you child, did you dwel with him sometime? wit dwelt with him indeed, as appeared by his rime, And serued him well, and wil was with him now &amp; than, but soft, thy name is wealth, I think in earnest he was litle acquainted with thee O it was a fine fellow as ere was borne, there will neuer come his like while the earth can corne: O passing fine Tarlton I would thou hadst liued yet. Wea. He might haue some, but thou showest smal wit, there is no such finenes in the picture that I see. sim. And thou art no Cinque Port man, thou art not wit free, the finenes was within, for without he was plaine, But it was the merriest fellow and had such iestes in store, that if thou hadst seene him, thou wouldst haue laughed thy hart sore. weal. Because of thy praise, what's the price of the picture. sim. Ile tell thee my lad, come hether, if thou wilt be ruled by me thou shalt pay nothing, Ile giue it thee, if thou wilt dwell with mee, and I promise thee this counsell is for thy prefarming, hadst not thou better serue a free man of the Citie, and learne a trade to liue another day, than to be a seruing boy in thy youth and to haue no occupation in thine age, I can make thee free if thou wilt be my prentice. wea. Why, wealth is free euery where, what need I serue you? My Lord is a freeman if that may doo me good. sim. I cry ye mercy M. boy, then your maister is free of the lords company and you serue him that ye may be a Lord when ye come out of your yeares. wit. Wealth is a proud boy, gaffar what say you to mee? sim. Thy name is wit, wilt thou dwell with me? wit. If I like your name and science, perchance wee'il agree simp. Nay, my name &amp; mine honestie is al one, it is wel knowen He's a very foole that cannot beguile me, for my name is simplicity. Wil. Coads gaffar wer not you a meal-man once and dwelt with Lady Conscience? sim. Yes, for want of a better. wil. What, a better man? sim. No, for want of a better mistresse, she was as very a foole as I We dwelt so long together that we went both on begging. Wit. Indeed they that vse a good conscience cannot sodainly be rich, But Ile not dwel with ye, you are too simple a maister for me. Wil, Nor Ile not dwell with you for all this worlds treasure. sim. No, why whom serue you Wil? Wil. I serue my Lord pleasure. sim. And whom serue you wit? Wit. I serue my Lord pollicie. simp. And whom serue you wealth? wea. I serue my Lord pompe. sim. You should be serued al with my Lord Birchley if you wer wel serued, these lads are so lordly that louts care not for them: for wealth serues Pomp, Wit serues pollicy, and wil serues pleasure. welth, wil you buy this picture for your Lord? Shew Tarltons picture, wea. No, it's too base a Present for pomp. Wit. And pollicy seldom regardes such a trifle. Wil, Come on gaffar, come on, I must be your best chapman, Ile buy it for pleasure, hold, there is a groat: sim. Gramercie good wil, my wife shal loue thee still, And since I can neither get Wit nor wealth, Let my wife haue her wil, and let me haue my health. God forgiue me, I thinke I neuer name her, but it coniures her, look where she comes, be mannerly boies that she knocke ye not with her staffe: keepe your owne counsell, and Ile make ye laugh. What doo yee lacke, what lacke ye. Stand away these boies from my wares, Get ye from my stall, or Ile wring you by the eares. Let my customers see the wares: what lack ye what would ye haue bought. Enter painfull Penurie, attired like a waterbearing woman with her Tankard. Pen. You haue customers inow and if they were ought, What do ye with these boies here to filtch away your ware? You show all your wit, you'il ne'er haue more care. Wil. Content ye good wife, we doo not filtch, but buy. Pen. I meant not you, yoong maister, Gods blessing on your heart You haue bought indeed sir I see, for your part. Be these two yoong Gentlemen of your companie, Buy Gentlemen, buy ballads to make your friends merrie. wit. To stand long with your burden, me thinks you shuld be weary Pen. True Gentlemen, but you may see poore painful penury Is faine to carry three Tankerds for a penie. But husband I say, come not home to dinner, its Ember day, You must eate nothing till night, but fast and pray. I shall loose my draught at Conduit, and therefore Ile away. Yoong Gentlemen God be with ye. sim. Wife, must I not dine to day? Pen. No sir by my fay. Exit Penurie. sim. If I must not eat, I meane to drinke the more. What I spare in bread, in ale Ile set on the skore. How say ye my lads? And doo I not speake wisely? Wit. Me thinks ye doo, and it's prety, that simplicity Hath gotten to his wife plaine painfull Penury. sim. Yea, I thanke God though she be poore and scarse cleanly, yet she is homely, careful and comely. One cal within. Wit, wealth and wil, come to your Lords quickly. wil. Must the Scutchions hang still? One wihin. yea, let them alone. wit. Farewel Maister simplicity. Exeunt. sim. Farewel good M. boies ene hartily, ene hartily, hartily. And heare ye wil, I thanke you for your hansel truly. Prety lads, heark ye sirs how? wil, wit, wealth. Enter VVit. wit. What's the matter you call vs backe so sodainly. sim. I forgot to aske you whither your three Lords of London be courtiers or Cittiners? wit. Citizens borne and courtiers brought vp: Is this all? Farewell. Exit. sim. Citizens borne and Courtiers brought vp, I thinke so, for they that be borne in London are halfe Courtiers before they see the Court, for finesse and manerlinesse oh passing, my maners and misbehauiour is mended halfe in halfe since I gaue ouer being a meal-man and came to dwell in London: ye may see Time dooth much, Time weares out yron horshooes: Time teares out milstones: Time seasons a pudding well, and Time hath made mee a free man, as free to beare water and sell Ballades, as the best of our copulation: I would haue thought once my horse should haue bene free as soon as my selfe, and sooner too, for he would haue stombled with a sacke of meale and lien along in the channell with it when hee had done, and that some cals freedome, but it's but a durtie freedome, but ye may see, bad horses were but iades in those daies: But soft, here comes customers: What lacke ye, what is't ye lack, what lacke ye? Come along and buy nothing: fine Ballades, new Ballades, what lack ye? Enter Nemo and the three Lordes. Ne. My Lordes come on, what suits haue you to me? Pol. Renowmed Nemo, the most onelie one That drawes no breath but of th'eternal aire, That knowest our suit before we bound to speak For thou art the very Oracle of thoughts: Whose vertues doo encompasse thee about, As th'aire surroundes this massie globe of earth. Who hast in power what euer pleaseth thee, And canst bestow much more than we may craue, To thee we seeke, to thee on knees we sue, That thou wilt deigne from thraldom to release, Those louely Dames, that London Ladies are. Ne. What, those three caitiefs long agoe condemn'd? Loue, Lucre, Conscience, wel deseruing death, Being corrupt with all contagion: The spotted Ladies of that stately towne. pom. Loue, Lucre, Conscience we of thee desire, Which in thy self hast all perfection, Accomplished with all integritie: And needest no helpe to doe what pleaseth thee, Who holdest Fame and Fortune both thy slaues, And doest compell the Destinies draw the coatch: To thee we sue, sith power thou hast thereto, To set those Ladies at their libertie. plea. At libertie, thou spotlesse Magistrate, That of the cause doost carie all regard, Carelesse of bribes, of birth and parentage, Because thy selfe art onely borne to blisse, Blesse vs so much that Lordes of London are, That those three Ladies borne and bred with vs May by our suites, release of thraldome find. Ne. Release my Lords? why seeke ye their relase? That haue perpetuall prison for their doome. pol. But Nemo can from thence redeeme them all. Ne. Their deeds were cause, not Nemo of their thral. Pom. Yet Nemo was the Iudge that sentence gaue. Ne. But Nemo neuer spill'd, whom he could saue: plea. Thou from perpetuall prison maist reuoke. Pol. Death hath no power gainst him to strike a strok Pom. Thou onlie milde and curteous sir, vouchsafe To graunt our suit, and set those Ladies free. Ne. What's your purpose in this earnest suit? Plea. To marie them, and make them honest wiues. Ne. But may it be that men of your regard, Lords of such fortune, and so famous place, Wil linke your selues with Ladies so forlorne, And so disteined with more then common crimes? Pol. Mariage doth make amends for many amisse. Pom. And loue doth couer heaps of combrous euils. plea. And doth forget the faults that were before. Ne. Meane as you say, ye neede to say no more. pol. In token that we meane what we haue said, Lo here our shieldes the prizes of our loue: To challenge all except thy selfe that dare Denie those Ladies to be ours by right. Ne. Woo them &amp; win them, win them &amp; wear th? too, I shal both comfort and discourage you my Lords, The comfort's this, of all those former crimes Wherwith the world was wont those dames to charge I haue them cleer'd and made them all as free As they were borne: no blemish left to see. But the discourage (gentle Lords) is this, The time of their indurance hath bene long, Whereby their cloathes of cost and curious stuffe Are worne to rags, and giue them much disgrace. Pom. Alas good Ladies, was there none that sued For their release, before we took't in hand? Ne. Yes, diuers for fair Lucre sought release, And some for Loue would faine haue paid the fees, But sillie Conscience sat without regard, In Sorrowes dungeon, sighing by her selfe: Which when I saw that some did sue for Loue, And most for Lucre, none for Conscience: A vow I made, which now I shall perfourme, Til some should sue to haue release for all, Iudg'd as they were, they should remaine in thrall: But you that craue their freedomes all at once Shal haue your suit, and see them here ere long, A litle while you must haue patience, And leaue this place: go in my Lordes before. Pom. Becommeth vs to waite on Nemo still, Ne. Not so: but Lordings, one condition more You promise me, sith they are in my power, I shall dispose them when they are releas'd Upon you three, as I shall thinke it best. Pom. Doe but commaund and we shall all subscribe. Ne. Then goe your ways, for I haue here to do. Exeunt 3. Lords Enter Sorrow. Sorrow draw neere, to morrow bring thou foorth Loue, Lucre, Conscience, whom thou hast in thrall, Upon these stones to sit, and take the aire, But set no watch or spyall what they doo. Exeunt ambo. Enter Fraud, Vsurie, Dissimulation, Simony and Simplicity. Frau. How happie may we call this merie day my mates, Wherein we meet, that once were desperate, I thinke, euer to haue seene one another, when Nemo that vpright Iudge had by imprisoning our Mistresses, banished vs (by setting such dilig?t watch for vs) out of London, and almost out of the world. But liue we yet? And are we met? and neere our old seat? Vsury is it thou? Let me see, or hath some other stolne thy face? Speakest thou man? Vsu. No Fraud, though many haue counterfeited both thee &amp; me, We are our selues yet, and no changlings I see: And why shouldst thou aske me man if I liue: The silly Asse can not feed on harder forrage than vsurie, She vpon thistles, and I vpon a browne crust of a moneth old. simp. So that Vsury and an asse are two of the profitablest beasts that a man can keepe, yet th'one hath sharper teeth than th'other. Frau. But what meanes Dissimulation? He droopes me thinks, What cheere man? Why cousen, frolick a fit, art thou not glad of this meeting? What's the cause of thy melancholy? Dis. Not melancholike, but musing how it comes to passe that we are thus fortunate to meet as we doo. simo. Ile tell thee why we met, because we are no mountaines. simp. But ye are as ill, for ye are monsters. simo. And men may meete though mountaines cannot. Frau, In token that this meeting is ioyfull to vs all, Let vs embrace altogether with harts ioy and affection. simp. I see many of these old prouerbes prooue true, tis merrie when knaues meet: Frau. How sir, whats that? Sim. If a man had a casting net, he might catch all you. Frau. Art not thou Simplicity? Simp. Goodman Simp. for I am maried, &amp; it like your maistership, And you are mast. Fraud too, a pox on your worship. I see, a fox and a false knaue haue all one luck, the better for banning, And many of you crafty knaues liue merilyer than we honest men. Frau. Sirra, bridle your tongue if you'il be welcom to our company No girdes nor old grudges, but congratulate this meeting, And sirs, if you say it, let's tel how we haue liued since our parting. simp. O it is great pity. Vsu. What? to tell how we haue liued: simp. No, that ye doo liue. Frau. Yet againe sirra. Vsury, as for thee it were folly to aske, for thou liuest but too wel, but Dissimulation and simony, how haue you two liued? discourse I pray you hartily. simp. Faith euen like two mice in an amberie that eat vp all the meat, and when they haue done, gnaw holes in the cupbord. Dis. Fraud, after my scaping away at the Sessions where I shifted as thou knowest in three sundry shapes, one of a Frier, and they can dissemble: another like a woman, and they doo litle else: the third as a Saint and a Deuill, and so is a woman. I was banished out of London by Nemo, to the countrie went I, amongst my olde friendes and neuer better loued than among the russet coates: once in a moneth I stole in othe market day to Leaden-hall and about, and sometime to VVestminster hall. Now hearing some speach, that the Ladies should be sued for, for I ame come in hope of my old intertaiment, supposing my selfe not knowen of many, and hoping the three Lords wil preuaile in their suit, and I to serue one of them. simp. He shall doo well that giues thee a coat, but he should do better, that could take of thy skinne. simo. And I haue bene a traueiler abroad in other realms, for here I am so cried out against by preachers (and yet some ministers that be none, could be content to vse me) that I was glad to be gone nowe in some other landes, and not verie far of, I am secretly fostered, sauing in Scotland, and the low Countries, they are refourmed, they can not abide me. Wel now and then hither I came stealing ouer sea, and hearing as you here intend as you doo, Frau. And for mine owne part, amongst artificers and amongst a few bad conscienced Lawyers, I haue found such entertainment, as dooth passe, yet would I with Lucre faine be as I was. simp. Fraud is as ill as a cut-purse, by the masse. Vsu. And for Vsury, the longer I liue, the greater loue I find Yet would I be with Lucre, again to please my mind. Frau. Heer's a good fellow too, one of our acquaintance, how hast thou liued Simplicity? simp. More honestly then all the rest of thy company: for when I might beg no longer, as begging was but bad, for you coson'd me once of an alms, I fel to tankard bearing, &amp; so got a wife of the same science, painful penury, then got I my freedom, and feeling my shoulder grow wearie of the tankard, set vp an easier trade to sel ballads. Frau. Hadst thou a stock to set vp withal? Simp. Wise inough to tell you, I, &amp; yonder's my stal, but beware I loose nothing, for if I do, Ile lay it straight to some of you, for I saw none so like theeues I promise you, since I set vp. Frau. Ye are a wise man when your nose is in the cup, but soft who comes here? step wee close aside, for these be the three Ladies for my life brought out of prison by their keeper, let vs be whist and we shall heare and see all, Sirra you must say nothing. Enter Sorrow and the three Ladies, he sets them on three stones on the stage. simp. not til ye speak for I am affraid of him that's with ye women. Con. O Sorrow when? when sorrow wilt thou cease To blow the sparke that burnes my troubled soule? To feede the worme that stings my fainting breast, And sharp the steele that goares my dieng heart? My thoughtes are thornes, my teares hot drops of lead, I plaine, I pine, I die, yet neuer dead. If world would end, my woe should but begin, Loe, this the case of Conscience for her sin: And sin the food wherewith my worme was fed, That stings me now to death, yet neuer dead. Loue. Yet neuer dead, and yet Loue doeth not liue, Loue that to losse in life her follie lent, Folly the food whereon her frailtie fed, Frailtie the milke that Natures breast did giue, Life, losse and follie, frailtie, foode and kinde, Worme, sting, thornes, fire and torment to the mind, Life but a breath, and follie but a flower, Frailtie claie, dust the foode, that fancie scornes, Loue a sweet bait to couer losses sower. Flesh breedes the fire that kindles lustfull thornes, Lust, fire, bait, scorne, dust, flower, and feeble breath Die, quench, deceiue, flie, fade, and yeeld to death, To death? O good, if death might finish all, We die each day, and yet for death we cal. Lucre. For death we call, yet death is stil in sight, Lucre doth seald in drops of melting gold, Accusing Rust, cals on eternal might, Where flames consume, and yet we freeze with cold: Sorrow addes Sulphur vnto Furies heat, And chops them yce, whose chattering teeth do beat, But sulphur, snow, flame, frost nor hideous crieng Can cause them die, that euer are in dying. Nor make the paine diminish or increase, sorrow is slacke, and yet wil neuer cease. Sor. When Sorrow ceaseth, Shame shal then begin, With those that wallow sencelesse in their sin: But Ladies I haue drawen you from my Den, To open aire to mittigate some mone. Conscience, sit downe vpon that sweating stone, And let that Flint (loue) serue thee for a seate, And Ladie Lucre, on that stone rest you. And Ladies thus I leaue you here alone, Mourne ye, but moane not, I shal absent be, Yet good it were sometime to thinke on me. Exit Con. Comfort it is to thinke on Sorrow past. Loue. Sorrow remaines when ioy is but a blast. Luc. A blast of wind is worldes felicitie, Con. A blasting wind and full of miserie. Loue. O Conscience, thou hast most tormented me. Luc. Me hath thy worm O Conscience, stong too deep. Con. But more my selfe my thoughtes tormented haue Than both of you in sorrowes sullen caue. From whence drawen foorth I find but litle rest, A seat vneasie, wet, and scalding hot, On this hard stone hath sorrow me assignde, Loue. and on my seat my selfe I frozen find. No flint more harde, no yce more cold then this. Lucre. I think my seat some mineral stone to be. I cold from it, it drawes heat from me. Ladies consent, and we our seates will view. Con. Dare we for shame our stained faces shew. Loue. My double face is single growen againe. Lucre. My spots are gone, my skin is smooth and plain. Con, Doffe we our veiles and greet this gladsom light. The chaser of glome sorrowes heauie might. Loue. Haile cheerful aire and clearest christal skie. Lucre. Haile shining sunne and fairest firmament, Comfort to those that time in woe haue spent. Con. Upon my weeping stone is set remorse in brazen letters. Loue. And on this Flint in lead is Charity. Lucre. In golden letters on my stone is Care. Con. Then Lucre sits vpon the stone of care. Lucre, And Conscience on the Marble of remorse, Loue. Loue on the flint of frozen Charitie, Ladies alas, what tattered soules are we? Con. Sorrow our hearts, &amp; time our cloaths hath torn Lucre, Then sit we down like silly soules forlorne, And hide our faces that we be not knowen, For Sorrowes plagues tormented me no more, Than wil their sight that knew me heretofore. Loue. then wil their sight that knew vs heretofore Draw ruth and help from them for our reliefe: Con. For our reliefe? for Conscience and for Loue, No help, smal ruth that our distresse may mooue: Loue, O Conscience thou wouldst lead me to dispaire, But that I see the way to hope is faire, And Hope to heauen directs a readie way, And heauen to help is prest, to them that pray. Lucre, That pray with faith, and with vnfain'd remorse For true beleefe and teares make praier of force: Con. Then veile our selues, and silent let vs stay, till heauens shall please to send some friends this way: Sit all downe Frau. Ladies vnmask'd, blush not for base attire, Here are none but friends and seruants all, deer Lady Lucre, Deerer vnto vs than daily breath we draw from sweetest aire; Dearer then life, dearer then heauen it selfe, Deigne to discouer those alluring lampes, Those louely eies more cleare than Venus Star, Whose bright aspectes worlds woonder do produce, Unueile I say that beauty more diuine, than Nature (saue in thee) did euer paint: that we sworne slaues vnto our mistresse, may Once more behold those stately louely lookes, And doo those duties which vs wel beseemes, Such duties as we all desire to doe. Con. I know that tongue Lucre, beware of Fraud. Luc. Of Fraud? Indeed by speech it should be he. Fra. what seekest thou Frau. Lucre, to honor thee with wit, with worth, with life, with al I haue, to be thy seruant as I was before, to get thee cloathes, and what thou wantest els. Lucre. No Fraud, farewell, I must be wonne no more, to keepe such seruants as I kept before. Simo. Sweet Lady Lucre, me thou maiest accept. Lucre. How art thou called? Simo. Simon. Lucre. I? No, sir, Conscience saith. Con. No Lucre, now beware, false not thy faith, For Simoni's subiect to perpetuall curse. Dis. As you two haue sped, I would desire to speed no worse, Frau. Make you a suit, you may chance to speed better: Dis.

Alas, I am vndone, ther's al the wealth &amp; stock I haue. Fra. Do ye long to loose your eares, be gone ye foolish knaue. Sim. I thanke ye Maister Fraud: Ile not goe so far, but Ile be neere to heare and see what the meaning of these fellowes in this canuas should be, for I know Fraud, Dissimulation, and simony to be those three: here I think I am vnseene. Simplicity hides him neer them. Frau. Vsury, thanke me for this good bootie, for it is I that holp ye to it, for I sould them to him for gold indeed in the shape of an old French artificer, come giue me halfe for I deserue it, for my part was the first beginning of this Comedie, I was euer affraid, least the foole should haue knowne me, for ye see now though disguisde, hee calme by my name. simp. Did a so? I am glad I haue found the french man, now Ile raise the street, but Ile haue my wares again, &amp; prooue ye as ye were, euer both false knaues I beleeue. Exit sim. Frau. Kil him, stab him, out villaine, he wil betray vs all. Vsu. What a foole were you to speake before he was gone, now you haue lost your part of this too, for he will goe complaine, you will bee sought for, and I made to restore these things againe. Fra. Not if thou be wise, thou wilt not tarie the reckoning, for seest thou not vs three? Dissimulation simony and my selfe? Vsu. Yes: What meanes these canuas suites? Will yee be Sailers? Fra. Vsury make one, this is our intent: let's see that none heare vs now: the Spaniards are comming thou hearest with great power, here is no liuing for vs in London, men are growen so full of conscience and religion, that Fraud, Dissimulation and Simony are disciphered, and being disciphered are also dispised: and therefore wee will slip to the sea, and meet and ioine with the enemie, and if they conquere as they may, for they are a great armie by report, our credite may rise againe with them, if they faile and retire, we may either goe with them and liue in Spaine, where we and such good fellowes are tollerated and vsed, or come slily again hether, so long as none knows but friends. Vsu. But wil you do thus you two? Dis. And thou too I hope, why, what should we do? Vsu. Whatsoeuer ye doe, be not traitors to your natiue countrie. Simo. Tis not our natiue countrie, thou knowest, I Simony am a Roman, Dissimulation a Mongrel, half an Italian, halfe a Dutchman Fraud so too, halfe French, and halfe Scottish: and thy parentes were both Iewes, though thou wert borne in London, and here Vsury thou art cried out against by the preachers: ioine with vs man to better thy state, for in Spain preaching toucheth vs not. Vsu. To better my state, nay, to alter my state, for here where I am, I know the gouernment, here can I liue for all their threatning, if strangers preuaile, I know not their lawes nor their vsage, they may bee oppressors, &amp; take al I haue, and it is like they are so, for they seek that's not their owne. Therfore here will I stay sure, to keepe what I haue, rather than be a traitor vpon hap and had I wist: and stay you if ye be wise, and pray as I pray, that the preachers and all other good men may die, and then we shall flourish, but neuer trust to strangers curtesie. Fra. We shal trust but to our friends &amp; kin, yo'il not go with vs, yet for old acquaintance keep counsel, betray vs not, for we'il be gone to sea, I am affraid yen foolish knaue haue belaied the streets for vs. Vsu. Let me go afore ye, if any such thing be, Ile giue ye inkling. Exit Fra. Do, farewel Vsury: and as he goes one way, we'il go another, follow sirs, neuer trust a shrinker, if he be your owne brother.

Then know Castillian Caualieros this, The owners of these Emblemes are three Lordes Those three that now are viewing of your shieldes, Of London, our chiefe citie are they Lordes, Pollicie, pompe, and pleasure be their names: And they in honour of their mistresses, Loue, Lucre, Conscience, London Ladies three, Emblazoned these Scutchens, challenging Whom durst compare, or challenge one of them, And Pollicie a Tortoys hath Emprez'd, Encompast with her shel, her natiue walles, And prouidens securus is his word: His page is Wit, his Maistresse Lady Loue. pomp in his shield a Lilly hath pourtrai'd, As paragon of beautie, and boone grace: Glorie sauns peere his word, and true it is, With Londons Pompe Castile cannot compare, His Page is wealth, his maistresse Lucre hight. Pleasure, the daintie of that famous towne, A Faulcon hath emblazon'd, soaring hie, To showe the pitch that Londons Pleasure flies: His word Pour temps, yet neuer stoupes to traine, But vnto Conscience, chosen for his deere. His Page is Will, and thus th'effect you heare. S. Pride. Buena buena per los Lutheranos Angleses. Fea. Mala, mala per Catholicos Castillianos. Pol. Loqueris Anglicè? Shea. Maximè Domine. Pol. Agedum, Go too then and declare thy Lords, their shields, their pages, and their purpose. Speak man, feare not, though Spain vse messengers il, Tis Englands guise to entreat them curteously. Shea. Three Caualieros Castillianos here, Without Compeeres in compasse of this world: Are come to conquer, as ful wel they shal this mool-hill Isle, that litle England hight, With London that proud paltrie market towne, And take those Dames Loue, Lucre, Conscience Prisoners, to vse or force as pleaseth them. The first (now quake) is Spanish Maiesty, That for his ympreze giues Queene Iunoes Bird, Whose traine is spangd with Argus hundred eies, the Queene of Gods scornes not to grace him so. His woord is Non par illi, none his like: Yet is his page or hench-man Modesty, Lucre the Lady that shal be his prize: And in his pendent on his Lances point, Sur le Ciel his word, aboue the heauens. pol. Whilome indeed aboue the heauens he was, Could he haue kept him in that blessed state, From thence for pride he fell to pit of paine, And is he now become the pride of Spaine? And so his page not Modesty but Shame. Wel, on the rest. sheal. Don Honor is the next grand peere of spain, Whose ympreze is a Courser saliant, Of colour Sables, darkening aire and earth, Pressing the Globe with his disdainfull foot. And sallieng to aspire to rowling skies, Non sufficit orbis is his haughtie woord, The world sufficeth not high Honors thoughtes, And on the pendent fixed on his Lance, A hand is catching at the sunnie beames: &amp; gloriam Phœbi, and the Suns bright coatch, Honor would guide, if he might haue his wil. His Page is Action tempering stil with state. pol. Himselfe Ambition, whom the heauens do hate, shea. And Loue the Lady that he hopes to gaine, pol. His thoughts distract from foule distempered brain Prooues him the verie firebrand of Spain: And in his shield his blacke disordered beast, Scaling the skies, scornfull to tread the ground, And both his words, proud words prooue perfectly Action his page to be but Treachery, Euer attendant on Ambition: but to the third. Sheal. The third graund Caualiero is Gouernment, Seuere in Iustice, and in iudgment deepe: His ympreze is a naked Infant goar'd Upon a Lance, signifing, seueritie. His word, pour sangue, for blood of enemies He bendes his forces: on his pendent is A Tyger licking of a bleeding heart: And Cura Cruor is the word thereon, His care's for blood of those that dare resist: Yet hight his Page that followes him, Regard, and he for Conscience to this conquest comes. pol. The Gouernment of spaine is Tyrannie, as doo his ympreze and his words declare, His Page is Terror: for a Tyrant feares His death, in diet, in his bed, in sleepe, In conscience: Spight the Spanish tyrannie Hath shed a sea of most vnguilty blood: Wel, what's the end? Shea. The end is best you yeeld, submitting you to mercy of these Lords. Pom. Before we fight? soft sir, ye braue too fast. Castilians, know that Englishmen wil knock, but say, Dooth Spanish Pride for Londons Lucre gape, ple. And would their Tyranny Conscience captiue haue? pol: Doth their Ambition Londons loue affect? sheal. All this they will, and pray vpon your towne, And giue your landes away before your face: alas, what's England to the power of spaine? a Molehil, to be placed where it pleaseth them. pom. But in this Molehil many Plsmyres be, All which will sting before they be remoou'd, What is thy name? sheal. Shealty, pol. An Irish word, signifieng liberty, rather remisnes, loosnes if ye wil, why hath thy coat a burning ship behind? shea. to signify ye burning of your fleet by vs Castilli?s. pol: It rather means your common wealth's on fire, about your eares, and you were best looke home, a common wealth's compared to a ship, If yours do flame, your countrey is hot, beware. Feal. I see Castilians, that you maruel much at this same Embleme of the Oliue tree Upon my backe: Lo this it signifies. Spaine is in warres, but London liues in peace, Your natiue fruit dooth wither on your soile, and prospers where it neuer planted was. This Londons Fealty dooth auouch for trueth, Herald of war, and Porter of their peace, Commaund ye me no seruice to my Lords. S. Pride. Quid tibi cum domini mox seruient miseri nobis: discede, Feal. Quid mihi cum dominis seruietis miseri meis? pom. shealty, say vnto yen Thrasos three. The Lordes of London dare them to the field, Pittieng their pride and their Ambition, Scorning their Tiranny, and yet fearing this, That they are come from home and dare not fight, But if they dare in ioint or seueral armes, Battaile or combat, him that Lucre seekes, Your Spanish pride, him dare I from the rest. ple. That bloodie curre, your Spanish Tyranny, That Londons Conscience would force with crueltie, I challenge him for Conscience sake to fight, a Lord of London, and I pleasure hight. And shealty, when Citizens dare them thus, Iudge what our Nobles and our courtiers dare: Pol. Say if thou wilt that Londons pollicy Discernes that proud Ambition of spaine, And for he comes enflamde with Londons loue, In combat let him conquere me and haue her, this is Loues fauour, I her seruant am. pom. This Lucres fauour, Pomp for her will fight. Plea. this Conscience fauour, she my mistresse is. shea. You crauen English on your donghils crowe. Pom. You Spanish Fesants crow vpon your pearch, But when we fire your coates about your eares, And take your shippes before your walled townes, We make a donghill of yoour rotten boanes, And cram our chickens with your graines of gold: shea. You will not yeeld? ple, Yes, the last moneth. shea. Farewel. Retire Heraldes with the pages to their places. S. Pride. Vade. pol. Herald, how now? Fea. Yen proud Castillians looke for your seruice. Pom. So do we for theirs: but Fealtie, canst thou declare to me the cause why all their pages follow them, when ours in showes do euer goe before. Fea. In war they followe, and the Spaniard is warring in mind pol. But that's not now the cause, yen three are Pride, Ambition Tyranny. shame followes pride, as we a prouerbe haue, pride goes before, and shame comes after, Treachery euer attendes vpon Ambiton: And Terrour alwaies with a fearfull watch, Doth wait vpon il conscienced Tyranny: But why stay we to giue them space to breath: Come, Courage, let vs charge them all at once. Let the three Lordes passe towards the Spaniards, and the Spaniardes make show of comming forward and sodainly depart. Pom. What brauing cowards these Castillians be, My Lordes let's hang our Scutchens vp againe, And shroud our selues but not farre off vnseene, To prooue if that may draw them to some deed, Be it but to batter our ymprezed shieldes. plea. Agreed, here Fealty, hang them vp a space. They hang vp their shieldes, and step out of sight. The Spaniardes come and flourish their rapiers neer them, but touch them not, &amp; th? hang vp theirs, which the Lords of London perceiuing, take their owne and batter theirs: The Spaniards making a litle showe to rescue, do sodenly slippe away and come no more. pol. Facing, faint-hearted, proud and insolent, That beare no edge within their painted sheaths, That durst not strike our sillie patient shieldes. Pom. Up haue they set their owne, see if we dare Batter on them, and beat their brauing Lordes. ple. Let them not yonder hang vnhackt, my Lords. Pol. With good aduise, that we be not surprised, and good enough. pom. My selfe wil onset giue on Prides, at your Peacocke sir. plea. At Tyrannies wil I bestow my blow, wishing the maister. Pol.

Their shieldes are ours, they fled away with shame, But Lordings, whiles the stratagenm is fresh, And memorie of thir misfortune greene, Their hartes yet fainting with the nouell griefe, Let vs pursue them flieng, if you say it, Haply, we may preuent their passage yet. pol. With speed and heede the matter must be done, ple. Therefore you Pollicie shall our leader be. Exeunt omnes. Enter three Ladies and Nemo. Ne. The day is ours, faire Ladies let vs ioy, The ioyfull day that all men may reioice, Yet onely I am thankfull for this good. And your good day at hand approcheth fast. Wherein you shall be ioinde to three such Lordes, As all the cities vnder heauens bright cope, Cannot with all their glorie match in worth, Lucre, Lord Pomp a victor comes to thee: Loue, looke thou for Lord pollicy aswell: And Conscience for her well reformed Fere, pleasure, that onely made his choice of her. Upon that day triumphant shall we feast, Wherein (Madames) your honors nil be least. Lucre. Against their comming might my read be hard, Prepare would we garlands of Laurell greene, To welcome them, more for the common good, Than for affection priuate that we beare. Loue. To meet them comming wil not be amisse, But what know we how they will take such work, Con.

And after all this circumstance, sir what be they? simp. they be not three what lacke yees, as what do yee lacke, fine Lockerome, fine Canuas, or fine Holland cloath: or what lacke ye, fine Ballades, fine Sonets: or what lacke ye, a purse or a glasse, or a paire of fine kniues: but they be three, haue ye anies, which mee thinks are neither sciences nor occupations, and if they be trades, they are very malapert trades, and more than reason. pol. As how sir? Name them. sim. Wil you banish them as readily as I can name them? the first is, haue ye any old yron, old male, or old harneis? pom. And what fault find ye with this? simp. What fault? I promise ye a great fault, what haue you or any man els to doo to aske me if I haue any old yron? What if I haue, or what if I haue not? Why should you be so saucie to aske? plea. Why foole, tis for thy good to giue thee money for that, that might lie and rust by thee. simp. No my Lord, no. I may not call you foole: it is to marke the houses where such stuffe is, that against rebels rise, there is harneis and weapon ready for them in such and such houses, and what then? the rustie weapon doth wound past surgerie, and kils the Queens good subiects: &amp; the rest of the old trash wil make them guns too, so it is good luck to find old yron, but tis naught to keep it, and the trade is crafty, and now my L. pollicy, I speak to you, t'were wel to put it downe. pol. Wisely said, which is your second? Is that as perillous? simp. Yea, and worse: It is, haue ye any ends of gold and siluer? this is a perilous trade, couetous, and a ticement to murther, for, marke ye, If they that aske this should be euill giuen, as Gods forbod, they see who hath this gold and siluer, may not they come in the night breake in at their houses, and cut their throates for it? I tell ye, gold and siluer hath caused as much mischiefe to be done as that, down with it. pom. they that haue it need not shew it. Sim, tush, they need ask no such question, many a man hath delight to shew what he hath, the trade's a ticing trade, downe with it: pol, Now your third sir: sim, that is the craftiest of all, wherein I am disbus'd, for that goes vnder the colour of simplicity, haue ye any wood to cleaue? ple. A perillous thing, what hurt is there in this sir? Sim. O do you not perceiue the subtiltie? why sir, the Woodmongers hires these poore men to goe vp and downe with their betles &amp; wedges on their backs, crieng, haue ye any wood to cleaue, and laugh to see them trauell so loden with wood and yron: now sir, if the poore men go two or three daies and be not set a worke (as sometimes they doo) the Woodmongers pay them and gaine by it, for then know they there's no wood in the citie, then raise they the price of billets so hie, that the poore can buy none. Now sir, if these fellowes were barr'd from asking, whether there were wood to cleaue or not, the woodmongers need not know but that there were wood, and so billets and fagots woulde be sold al at one rate, downe with this trade, we shall sit a cold els my Lords. Ple. I promise you a wise suit, and done with great discretion. sim. Yea, is it not? might ye not do wel to make me of your counsel I beleeue I could spie moe faults in a weeke, than you could mend in a moneth: pol. Wel, for these three faults the time serues not now to redresse: sim. No marie, for you three must be maried sodainly, and your feast must be drest: pom, Against which feast, repaire you to Diligence, and hee shal appoint you furniture and money, and a place in the show, till when farewell. Exeunt sim. Farewell my Lords, farewel my three Lords, and remember that I haue set ech of yee a fault to mend: wel, Ile go seek M. Dilig?ce that he may giue me forty pence against the feast sir reuerence: Exit Dil. what is it M. Fraud, ye would demaund of me? Dil. &amp; Frau. step out Frau. Sir this you know, though your selfe be a man of good reckoning, yet are yee knowen an officer vnto these three Lords, and what discredit it were to me, being a noted man to passe through the streets with you being officer, or if any of my friends should suspect me with you, and dog vs, and see me committed to Newgate, I were vtterly discredited, here is a purse sir, and in it two hundred Angels, looke sir, you shall tell them. Dil. Here are so indeed, what meane yee by this, I will not take these to let ye escape. deliuer Fraud the purse againe. Fra. I meane not so sir, nor I wil not giue halfe of them to be suffered to scape, for I haue done no offence, though it please them to imprison me, and it is but on commandement, I shal not stay long, but I will geue you this purse and gold in pawne to be true prisoner, onely giue me leaue to goe some other way, and home to my lodging, for my bootes and other necessaries, for there Ile leaue word I am ridden out of towne, and with al the hast that possibly I may, I wil meet you at Newgate, and giue you an Angell for your curtesie; there is the purse. Fraud giues him a purse like the other. Dil. I hazard (as you know) my Lords displeasure herein, and yet to pleasure you I will venture this once, but I pray ye make hast that I be not shent, I would not for ten Angels it were knowen. Fra. If I tarie aboue an hower, take that gold for your tarieng. Exit. Dil. I do not feare that you'l forfeit so much for so litle cause. Exit. Enter Nemo with Desire, Delight, and Deuotion, the three Lordes of Lincolne. Ne. My Lords of Lincolne, haue you such tytle and such interest To Loue, Lucre, and Conscience, as ye say? Who gaue you leaue to haue accesse to them? I am their father by adoption, I neuer knew of Loue twixt them and you: And to perpetuall prison they were doom'd, From whence I onelie might deliuer them. Which at the suit of three most matchlesse Lordes, Their countrimen, in London bred as they, I haue perfourm'd, and freed them from their bonds, And yet haue bound them in their freedome too To Pollicie, to pleasure, and to pomp, Three Lords of London, whose they are in right, Contracted wiues, and done by my consent, And euen to morrow is the mariage day, Except your comming stay or break it off, I wil go call their Lords to answere you, The (yvnder couert Baron) medle not. Exit. Desire. Fetch them Lord Nemo, we will here attend. Delight. Attend we may, but vnto litle end, The Ladies are in hucksters handling now, Deuo. I would I had my time in praieng spent, That I in woing Conscience did consume. Enter the three Lordes of London and Nemo. Desire. Here come the Lords, let's show good countenance man. Pom. Yet more adoe before we can inioy The ioies of mariage with our mistresses? Be these the Lords that tytle doo pretend? My Lords of Lincolne, so we heare you be. What are your names? Del. Deuotion, Desire, and Delight. pom. Which comes for Lucre? Desire. I Desire. ple. Which for Conscience? Deuo. I Deuotion. pol. Which for Loue? Del. I Delight. pol. You shall be answered straight. ple. I can answere them quickly: ye cannot haue them, nor ye shall not haue them. pol. Stay pleasure, soft: My Lord Desire, you Lucre seeke, Desire of lucre (be it without reproch to you my Lord) is couetousnes which cannot be seperated long from that: read my Lord. Point to the stone of Care. Desire. In golden letters on this stone is written Care. pol. Care with desire of lucre well agrees, the rather for that Londons Lucre may not be seperated from Londons Pompe, so you may take that stone if ye will, but the Lady you cannot haue. Desire. And a stone is a cold comfor in steed of Lucre. pol. Deuotion to Conscience (I speake now to you my Lord that are learned) is sorrow for sinne, or in one word read. point to the stone of Remorse. Deuot. On this sweating stone in brasse is set Remorse. pol. And that is your portion, for Conscience is bestowed on Londons Pleasure, because London maks a conscience what pleasure they vse and admit, and what time they bestowe therein, and to what end: so my Lord Deuotion, either that or nothing. Deuo. A stone is a hard lot in steed of a Ladie. pol. My Lord Delight, that do delight in Loue, you must I loue, for making choice of mine. Loue is my portion, and that Flint is yours. Del. Here in lead is written, Charitie: and what of this? pol. If you be (as I doubt not) honest delight in loue, then in the best sence, you can haue but Charitie, if you be (which I suspect not) other Delight in Loue, you must be noted for Concupiscence, and that you will blush to be: wel Charitie is your best, then that is your portion: For, marke ye, Londons pollicy ioines with Londons Loue: to shew, that all our pollicie is for loue of Londons common wealth: and so our loue cannot be seperate from our pollicy, you beare this. Delight. A Flint's a hard change for so faire a wife. pol. And thus Lords, Desire of Lucre may take Care, Deuotion of Conscience may haue Remorse, and Delight of Loue may haue Charitie, other recompence none. ple. And so we three leaue you three with Care, Remorse, &amp; charity. Exeunt. Desire. With Care and Remorse I sweare, ye doo leaue vs, but what charitie I cannot tell. Deuot. Wel, yet must we vse Charity though we faile of our desire, and we are answered with such reason as is not to be gainsaid. Del. Indeed my Lord your calling is to perswade to Charity, but if I vse patience, it shall be perforce. Deuo. Yet being so wisely warn'd, me thinks wee should be arm'd And take this in worth, that the world wonder no further, I wil take vp my hard burden of Remorse and be gone. Exit Desire. It is good to follow examples of good, Ile take this heauy burden of Care, and follow as I may. Exit Del. Because Ile not be singular, Ile frame my selfe to follow, taking this cold portion of Charitie as my share. exit Enter Simplicity with Diligence. Simp. Come on M. Didligence, I haue bene seeking ye, as a man should seek a load of hay in a needles eie. Dil. And why hast thou sought me (I pray thee) so earnestly? simp. Why? For this ointment, these shels, these pictures, do ye not know this Countus mountus cum this da mihi? Dil. What money, why? Do I owe thee any money? Simp. Owe me? Tush, no man, what do ye talke of owing? Come, and yet I must haue some certaine sigillatum &amp; deliberatum in præsentia. Doo you not vnderstand sir? Fourty pence and furniture by my Lord pompes pointment, against the wedding day: to bee one of the show-makers, I doe not say shoo-makers, and yet they be honest men. Dil. I vnderstand thee now, and thou shalt want neither mony nor furniture for that: sawest thou not Fraud lately? Sim. No, a Fox ferit him, for if I could find him, I would make him fast ynough for cosoning me of ten shillings for certain copper buttons and rings, I thought to haue bene a haberdasher, and he hath made me worse than a hay-maker. Dil. I may say to thee in counsell, but Ile haue no words of it, hee hath ouerreacht me too: but if thou spie him first, let me vnderstand, and if I see him first thou shalt haue knowledge, for Ile tell thee, but laugh not, he shewed me a purse with a h?dred pound in Angels, which he would deliuer me in pawne to be my true prisoner, because for his credite, he was loth to goe with me through the streetes to Newgate: I refused it at first, but at last by his intreatie I was content to take his pawne, and thinking he had giuen me the right purse of golde, he had another like it, which he gaue me with counters, and so went away, I neuer did see him since, but mum, no words of it. simp. No words quoth a, that's a stale iest, would you be coson'd so? Dil. Wel, so it is now, come follow me for thy furniture and money. exeunt Enter Dissimulation and Fraud in caps, and as the rest must be for the showe. Dis. The coast is cleare, come follow Fraud and feare not, for who can discipher vs in this disguise, thus may we shufle into the showe with the rest, and see and not be seene, doing as they doo, that are attired like our selues. Fra. That is, to stand amongst them, and take as they take, torches or any thing to furnish the showe, now if we we can passe but this day vnseene, let to morrow shift for it selfe as it may, I promise thee Dissimulation thou art verie formall. Dis. Not more than thy self Fraud, I would thou sawest thy picture Frau. Picture here, picture there, let's follow our busines. Exeunt. Enter a Wench singing. Strowe the faire flowers and herbes that be greene, To grace the gaiest wedding that euer was seene. If London list to looke, the streetes were nere so cleene, Except it was when best it might, in welcome of our Queene: Three louely Lords of London shall three London Ladies wed, Strowe sweetest flowers vpon the stones, perfume the bridall bed. Strowe the faire flowers. &amp;c. Enter first Diligence with a Truncheon, then a boy with Pollicies Launce and shield, then Pollicie and Loue hand in hand: then Fraud in a blew gowne, red cap and red sleeues, with Ambitions Lance and shield, then a boy with Pomps Launce and shield, then Pompe and Lucre hand in hand: then Dissimulation with Prides Launce and shield, then a boy with Pleasures Lance and shield: then Pleasure and Conscience hand in hand: then Simplicitie with Tirannies Lance and shield: they al going out, Nemo staies and speakes. Ne. These Lordes and Ladies thus to church are gone, An honoured action to solemnize there, With greater ioy wil they return anone, Than Cæsar did in Rome his Laurell weare. Lord pollicy hath Loue vnto his Fere, Lord pompe hath Lucre to maintaine his port, Lord pleasure Conscience to direct his sport. Vsury is marked to be knowen, Dissimulation like a shadow fleetes, And Simony is out of knowledge growen, And Fraud vnfound in London but by fits. Simplicity with painefull penurie sits, For Hospitality that was woont to feed him, Was slaine long since and now the poore doo need him. That Hospitality was an honest man, But had few friendes (alas) if he had any, But Vsury which cut his throat as than Was succoured, and sued for by many. Would Liberality had bene by thy side, Then Hospitality, thou hadst neuer died. But what meane I, one of the mariage traine, To mourne for him wil nere be had againe. His Ghost may walke to mocke the people rude: Ghostes are but shadowes, and doe sense delude: I talke too long, for loe this louelie crue Are comming backe, and haue perfourm'd their due. Returne as they went, sauing that the blew gownes that bare shields, must now beare torches: Simplicity going about, spies Fraud, and falleth on his knees before Pleasure and Conscience, saieng. Simp. O Lady Conscience that art maried to Lord pleasure, Help thy seruant simplicity to recouer his lost treasure: A boone my Lords, all for Loue and Lucre sake, Euen as you are true Lordes, help a false lout to take, plea. Thou shalt haue helpe, speake, what is the matter? simp. See you yen fellow with the torch in his hand? One the falsest villaine that is in this land, Let him be laid hold on that he run not away, And then yee shall heare what I haue to say. ple. Diligence bring him hether, good Lordes and Ladies stay. simp. O Maister Fraud, welcome to the buts, Now Ile haue my ten shillings in spite of your guts, The French Canker consume ye, you were an old Frenchman, Da goll buttoone, goll renga, bugla lase, you coson'd me than, My Lords I beseech ye that at tyborne he may totter, For in steed of gold, the villaine sold me copper. plea. Is this true M. Skil? Fra. It is true in a sort my Lord, I thought to bee pleasant with him being my old acquaince, and disguis'd my selfe like an old French Artificer and hauing a few copper knacks, I sold them to him to make sport for ten shillings, which money I am content to pay him againe so shall he haue no losse though he haue made a litle sport. ple. First giue him an Angell before my face. Simplicity, art thou pleased? Sim. Truly I am pleas'd to take a good Angell for ten shillinges, speciouslie of such a debter as M. Fraud: but now I am to bee pleas'd otherwise, that is, to see him punished, I promise yee the people loue him wel, for they would leaue work and make halfe holiday to see him hanged. ple. That his punishment may please thee the better, thou shalt punish him thy selfe: he shall be bound fast to yen post, and thou shalt bee blindfold, and with thy torch shalt run as it were at tilt, charging thy light against his lips, and so (if thou canst) burne out his tongue, that it neuer speake more guile. Sim. O Singulariter Nominatiuo, wise Lord pleasure: Genetiuo bind him to that poste, Datiuo, giue me my torch, Accusat. For I say he's a cosoner. Vocat. O giue me roome to run at him. Ablat. take and blind me. Pluraliter, per omnes casus. Laugh all you to see mee in my choller adust to burne and to broile that false Fraud to dust. Bind Fraud, blind Simplicity, turne him thrise about, set his face towards the contrarie post, at which he runnes, and all to burnes it, Dis. standing behind Fraud, vnbindes him, and whiles all the rest behold Simp. they two slip away: Pleasure missing Fraud saith. plea. Wisely perfourm'd, but soft sirs, where is Fraud? O noble villaine, gone whiles we beheld the other: Who loosed him? Who let him slip? wel, one day he wil pay for all: vnblind Simplicity. Simp. How now, Haue I heated his lips? haue I warm'd his nose? and scortched his face? Let me see, how lookes the villaine? Haue I burned him? Dil. Thou hast done more, for thou hast quite consumed him into nothing, looke, here is no signe of him, no not so much as his ashes. Simp. Uerie few ashes if there be any, ye may see what a hot thing anger is, I thinke that the Torch did not waste him so much as my wrath: wel, al London, nay, al England is beholding to me, for putting Fraud out of this world, I haue consum'd him &amp; brought him to nothing &amp; Ile tread his ashes vnder my feet, y t no more Frauds shal euer spring of them: But let me see, I shal haue much anger, for the Tanners wil misse him in their lether, the Tailors in cutting out of garments, the Shoo-maker in closing, the Tapsters in filling pots, and the verie oistermen to mingle their oisters at Billinsgate, yet it is no matter the world is well rid of such a craftie knaue. plea. Well now thou art satisfied, I wish all here as wel contented, And we my Lords that praise this happie day, Fall wee on knees and humbly let vs pray, pom. First that from heauen vpon our gratious Queene, All maner blessings may be multiplied, That as her raigne most prosperous hath bene, During worlds length so may it stil abide, And after that with saintes be glorified. Lord graunt her here health, hearts-ease, ioy and mirth. And heauen at last, after long life on earth. pol, Her counsel wise, and Nobles of this land Blesse, and preserue O Lord with thy right hand. plea. On all the rest that in this Land doo dwell, Chiefly in London, Lord poure downe thy grace, Who liuing in thy feare and dying well, In heauen with Angels they may haue a place. FINIS.</field>
