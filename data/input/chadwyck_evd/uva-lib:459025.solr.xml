      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. Enter Aurelia and a Servant. Aur. Can the Prince Philanthus, my cosen, look so far beneath himself, as on my servant. Ser. Madam, believe me, he makes love to her daily, and now they are together in the Garden. Aur. If this be true, as I begin to fear, for I have heard him make some desperate protestations; yet, by the stronger Magick of this brow, I'le break those Spells that hold him; these Eyes, which have to all that sued been clad in frownes, shall, for his sake, receive all the additions, that a womans art can give, to make them Victors. He shall not cast away himselfe, nor spend a sigh more, for so mean a person. For sure, when I shall cosen him, making him think, that I will daigne to love, hee'l hate himselfe, and flie so mean a Mistresse. I'l see, if they be still together. [Exeunt.] Enter Philanthus and Miranthe. Mir. I see the Princess comming. Phil. The better. Injure not so much your own merit, To misdoubt the truth of what I say; and if you fear A change, I'le call the gods to witnesse. Enter Aurelia, and Servant. Mir. Good my young Lord, spare your rash inconsiderate oaths, Which you would be content to buy again at any rate, Within this month. Aur. Crafty Wench, she sees us. Mir. You must not think, that I will lay my selfe Open to your courtship thus alone, it was By accident you met me, pray let go. Phil. Will you then leave me? Aur. How now, Cosen, making love to Miranthe? Phil. Madam, I should be glad to gain her good opinion. Aur. Cousen, I hope the Court has not infected you as yet. Will you dissemble with me your friend, or no, if I should seriously ask you a question? Phil. Madam, if I already know that vice you name, My I or No, will be but small assurance. Aur. yet I dare trust you. Love you Miranthe earnest? Why do I ask? I do not think you yet know what love means. Phil. Not what it is, I would I did not. Aur. I see you do, that sigh approves it. And, Miranthe, you love entirely. Phil. Admit I grant. [Exeunt Miran. &amp; Ser.] Aur. Leave us a little. Then you must grant withall, That you much injure your self; for you are equall To the greatest in your blood; to say, your minde Or person's lovly, is a truth, befits some other Better then my selfe to speak. Yet friendship, And pitty of your youth, to see you ignorantly offer your devotions To so poor a Saint, whose influence, though ne'r so favourable, Cannot protect you from a generall scorn forces me To tell you, you will be counted of a low spirit, Or wondrous ignorant, in loving Miranthe, Your birth being so far above hers. Phil. Madam, 'tis true, that being descended from your house, I should have as just reason to be proud in that respect, as any: But, being otherwise defective in those things, Which I could not receive from Ancestours, my mind and manners; Wonder not, that like a bastard Eaglet, I refuse to look upon The Sun-bright Beauties of the Court. Yet, Madam, You must think, in her I lord there's something, Though perhaps not obvious to your eyes, That to me renders her lovely. Aur. 'Tis true, shee's a good Wench, perhaps her vertue takes you. Phil. Madam, I know you do not sleight that in others, Though in her you do; shee's your servant and you say, She's my Mistresse, and Vertue should be Mistresse to us all. Give me leave so far, to justifie her and my selfe as to say, If she be more vertuous then the fairest Lady living, I ought to love her best. Aur. Yes, if you could be married to her vertues, not to her person; For six pence I'le buy a Book, shall more instruct you in that way. But think you, Cosen, Vertue and Beauty may not dwell together. I am accounted fair; wherein have I appeared to you Lesse vertuous than Miranthe? Phil. In nothing, Madam, rather the wonder of your sex. Aur. Cousen, believe me, there are many in the Court, that exceed Me in both. Let me perswade you leave Miranthe rather for your Man to woe, and dedicate your worthier services to some of those that I shall name you. Phil. Madam, you perswade strongly, for I rely upon your counsell As an Oracle But think you, I have handsomess or wit. To make me acceptable to a fair Lady? Aur. Yes doubtlesse. Phil. I fear you say it only, to draw me from my Mistress. But swear, you think me worthy. Aur. As I live I do. Phil. Well, Madam, you have perswaded me to be unconstant; If there be a punishment, may't light on you: Or, if I fail to gain a Mistress, you must promise To instruct me; for, whom you'l please to name As worthy, I'le make love to tell you all my discourse, And shew you all my Letters. Aur. Must you needs be in Love, it seems you have been much given to read love Books; when I know your study, I shall fit you with a Mistresse. Phil. Faith, Madam, they live such pleasant lives in those books, Kissing their Mistresses hands, and looking on their fair eyes, That I have envied them. Aur. Your imagination's very strong, you begin with me. I must provide a Mistress for you very shortly, I shall be troubled with you else my self. Exeunt. Enter two Courtiers. 1. Trust to my skill thus far, I have wrought him handsomly 2. My part is onely, to be ready to entertain you. 1. No more. 2. Fare-well then. Exit. 1. Fare-well. Let me alone to fit him here in the Country to the business, th'ass is rich, his father more fool then he, doting upon his sons believed perfections— Here comes the old fool. Enter old Gudgen. O. Gud. Good-morrow Mr. Courtier, you'r late a -rising; you should have seen my son, your scholler, break halfe a dosen staves else, as gratiously, as ere a poor mans son in Milain, and for Cut, black Cut. 1. Indeed hee's a good sober beast. O. Gud. Very quick, he starts before you can tell twenty; first does he trot, but then stand; I have the barrier thus with my whip aloft, and when he comes, flash quoth I, away goes Cut so fast, you cannot see him move, then does he stop most willingly. 1. He does indeed. O. Gudg. And turnes about with great 'liberation and 'gillity, but old Roane what say you to him, there a hot Jade indeed, as like my son as can be, firy and full of mettall, and here comes the grace of our Country, though I say't. Enter young Gudgen and Man. Y. Gud. Luckey, poulcroone, look to my Roane Jennet, let him allay his fury in thy hand, before he fet his hoof within the stable, and shouldst thou let him drinke, thou diest as I am generous. Man. Saving your young worships pleasure; he had more need be set up, and have a peck of grains, heel ne're be able to plow to morrow else. Y. Gud. Peasant, I say let him allay his heat, and for the plow thou talkest on, I will have thee know this mornings service hath manumiz'd him from such base employments. O. Gudg. How Son, whats that? Y. Gud. I must speak plaine to his dull understanding, oh torment! let it suffice that Roane is free from service of the plow or harrow. Man. I your worship I am sure hath harrow'd all the flesh off his back, a little rest and meat will do well, Sir. Y. Gud. Another word, and as I hope to be a Gentleman, Ile make him feed on thee. Man. Good your worship. Y. Gud. Nay worse, thou shalt not wait upon me to our Court of Milan. O. Gud. 'Tis his care, Son you must forgive him. Y. Gud. Live then; and thank this aged Nobleman. O. Gud. Oh hopefull boy, hee may be one indeed Sir may he not. 1. Yes yes? O. Gud. 'Tis no matter though I be a yeoman still. 1. No no, there will be no great indecorum in it. O. Gud. I, as you say 'twere well I were a'the coram, and so I will when my son's a Lord. Enter a Taylor. Y. Gud. How my cloaths not made yet! let me perish, if I do not revenge the blood of all the innocent lice, since the first Taylor. Tay. I beseech your worship, you know I wanted, and you promist to let me have some money before hand. Y. Gud. How Taylor! money before hand? dost thou not know I am to be a Courtier, thou ignorant Country vermine, can there be hope to prosper in a suite paid thee for, before hand. 1. No tis unpossible you would appeare a prodigie Y. Gud. A prodigie; thats fine ifaith, nay I will pay aforehand then, and be a prodigie; if that be all my man to, he shall be a prodigie. Man. I thank your worship. Enter Dancer. Y. Gud. Master of the Dance and Fence you have been long a comming. Dancer. Your worship knowes tis two long mile and I came but softly, I must be more carefull of my leggs then another man. Y. Gud. Why so man, thou makest new ones every day. Dance. I Sir but I make them with my leggs, and every trades man will preserve his tools. Man. Or else his wife will Chide him when he comes home. Enter Singer. Y. Gud. Ha, ha, ha, him sol, sol fa, fa. Sing. I am glad to hear your worship so carefull of my documents, use a voyce, and have a voyce. Y. Gud. Come come shall we to't? 1. Sir 'twere best to day you only us'd your martiall exercises, you have rid, and fencing will be enough. Y. Gud. You say true, first I will learne to fight, and then to make my approaches to the Ladies: if they refuse to yield to my Courtship, Ile compell them by force of Armes. 1. How ravish them, prove a Tarquine? Y. Gud. I, ten Tarquines, what shall they contend with me? Man. By my faith, I will take your worships part. Y. Gud. Shee that shall oppose me had better come on Master of the Noble science, behold thy scholle does thus confront thee. Dan. Stay Sir you are too furious, first you must marke your distance. O. Gud. I but sonne, you lost your opportunity; I have seen the time I would not have fail'd to pai'd him o're the nodel, at such a vantage. Y. Gud. How take upon you to teach me, goe to, you'r an old busie fool, but, lets see what you can doe, come on your waies. O. Gud. Alas sonne, I am old, threescore. Y. Gud. I know you might have been my father, but I have seen a wiser at thirty, come on Sir. O. Gud. Nay Son. Y. Gud. Take 'em, I charge you as you expect my favour, Ile let you see the fence is alter'd since your sword and buckler time. Tay. I have an itching to him. 1. Sir your Father's old, you'l kill him. Y. Gud. 'Tis no matter, I shall not be asham'd on him when I am a Lord. 1. Faith Sir, play with your Tayler, hee's a great mind too't. Y. Gud. Has he, come on Sir shred, dare you adventer, the third part of a man to encounter; dost thou know what thou dost, I am a prodigie. Tay. I Sir, but I must help to make you so: one bout sir, and it were at Cudgels, I durst venter the making of your worships cloaths. Y. Gud. Oh base Cudgels, I will kill that lowse that sits upon thy ninth button. Tay. Well sir. They Play. Y. Gud. Oh Rogue do you offer to strike, and then to thrust against the Order of fence, this 'tis to play with ignorance. 1. 'Tis true sir, I wonder you would doo't. Tay. I know the blow could not be great, alas I am but a louse, a shred at the most, Sir, but the third part of a man. 1. Away, you are saucie. Tay. Will please your worship to let me have something before hand. Y. Gud. A pox on thee, thou hast given me too much. Tay. Truly sir, it was against my will, I did not think it possible I could have hit your skilful worship, wilt please your worship try another bout? Y. Gud. No prithee. 1. A pox a these Marshall Exercises, Lets to the City, Dance, Drinke, Whore, and Dice, These are the vertues, fighting is a vice. [Exeunt. Enter Adrastus. Adra. Oh inconstant Aurelia, but women must be women still, Changing though for the worst: for wherein can Philanthus be justly pris'd before me; hee's young And unexperienc'd, so cannot serve her with that waryness He ought considering her Birth, sure she cannot love him, oh yes she does, she does, it is apparent. They are still together and see, good manners pardon me. Enter Philanthus and Aurelia. Ile marke their actions, tho I cannot heare. Phi. Maddam do not refuse to instruct me your scholler. But heare in what language I am able to deliver My affection in, and give such an answer as you think Adrastus sister will do, whom you have appointed me to make love to. Aur. I will, Phi. Faire Aurelia. Aur, Her name's Lucinda. Phi. Maddam you know that all one, but is th'at-tribute of Faire sufficient. Aur. Tis old and foolish either to say, faire or vertuous. Or maddam, mistris, or goddesse, or Divine Lady Sweete Creature, or abstract, or indeede Any thing that way. Phi. Then thus, If the respect I beare your had been lesse, Or that after the tender of my loyall heart, And your refusall of it, I could have liv'd, To enjoy your sight I had long ere this Made my love known, but since the Manifestation of your disdaine and my death are Inseparable accidents, wonder not that I Have lost so many opportunities to tell you. For all Creatures have a desire to preserve life: And now I see my last period approaching. For in your heavenly eyes I read the sentence of my death, As plaine as if the book of fate lay open to me. You'r are the book of fate in two respects, To all that see and know you as I do. For it they love you, they justly perish by your scorne. If they love you not, their ignorance transformes Them into beasts, a worse Condition for a man Then not to be at all hope cannot foole me further, Then only make me to believe, that since I have some interest in your blood youl shed a teare, To witnes that you greeve my ruine. Aur. May I perish, if you have not delivered this with as much passion. As if Lucinda for whom this speech was fram'd, Had beene before you, but how shall shee conceave That where you speak of interest in her blood? Are you akine to her? Phi. When you have answered in her person; for that, I shall resolve You. Aur. Well if your affection were thus violent as you pretend, I cannot but acknowledge that the consideration of it Were sufficient to move pitty in any woman, That did allow the follies of protesting lover's. But for my part I have ever laugh'd at those, Who hop'd to gaine love by the manifestation Of their sufferings, and therefore had you profest lesse Till you had made your merits appeare greater, It would have mov'd me more: when I shall see That in you which I asmuch covet to enjoy, As it seemes you do now something in me. Then which an equality of affection we shall Meet without all these sophisticated protestations, And not before: for as you pursue that which you think Would be your happinesse, so do I mine. Which I am sure consists in my freedome From the follies of Love. Phi. Tis even so, you have delivered nothing but what I expected. The greatest merit I shall ere attaine to, Is quickly to remove out of the world. One whom you so much contemn. Aur. Philanthus, would you take this way Offers to kill himselfe. To assure your mistris of your affection? Phi. No other wayes then by my death after the assurance of her disdaine. Aur. P'shew, you must not despair for the first deniall. Our hearts and tongues do not alwayes agree. And because I am to instruct you to gaine your mistris, Ile discover some part of womens disposition, to you; Tho it be to our disadvantage. Phi. Maddam you shall infinitely oblige me. Aur. First there's few of us what ere we seeme, But are content to be belov'd by all that see us. And those who are of birth may expresse love, In their actions without offence, tho nere so many. But he that comes to tell his mistris in words he loves, her, Had need be first assur'd that shee beleeves That he hath worth enough to gaine a mistris Equall to her self in merits, should he make Tender of his love else where: for when an other Would receave that which is offer'd it does approve The valew of the guift, and setts the giver Free from scorne. Phi. Maddam for this I thanke you, but more I beseech you. Aur. I will, it may be you beleeve you could not more Oblige your mistris to respect you then by giving Her assurance of many oaths that you can never love Any other Lady, tho shee should much neglect you. Phi. Maddam, I do. Aur. I thought so, marke a generall errour: whatsoere, We are sure is ours, the worth of it doth lessen In opinion, for we are still in pursuit Of new and difficult things to attaine: yet it is As great a greefe to us if our prisoners. Should undo their chaines as 'tis contentment To enthrall a new one and make another. Womans servant ours, pleases above thought, Because it is a testimony of our great vertue And merit that drew him. Phi. The Change may grow as well from his inconstancy, As Judgement in discerning the worthier. Aure. At least he will add one to the number, and multiplying Is the art most women study that are faire. Aur. Are all so? Maddam; are you so? Phi. I did not tel you I would give you my particular Character, 'twas the generall I spake. Phi. Maddam, I take it for granted, you are not such. For these you name, are faculty in their humours. And therefore you being singular deserve more love, Which trust me maddam I must pay to You. Not to Lucinda what ere I have seem'd. Nor ever lov'd I Miranthe. Aur. How Philanthus? Phi. Maddam, tis true by all that can be sworne by. That I only love Aurelia now, but how long. It will continew, if shee neglect me, that I cannot tell. Aure. This is fine Jugling, do you make me discover The weaknes of our sex, and then assault my selfe. I hate you, hence from my sight. Phi. Maddam, I do not believe you, you told me your self. That womens hearts and tongues do not alwayes agree. Aur. But I told you withall I spoke not of my selfe. And you granted too, I was not like other women. Which you then made the argument of your love. Therefore you must beleeve me when I say I hate you. Phi. Yes when I do beleeve that, I deserve it. You swore you thought me worthy when you went about To perswade me from Miranthe, which assurance you Said was necessarie before the verball protestation Of affection, and feare not that you shall be too assur'd That I esteeme you, for I, according to your owne rule Will cease to love you when you use me ill. Aur. Of which assure your self, for you have offended me much. I much above expression, pray leave me to my self. Phi. Maddam I will, but for my owne advantage. For when I am gon, you cannot choose but consider, That my merit to your words is equall to the best. Deserver, henceforth I will not wo in words but action. And if you love, each thought is of my faction. Exit. Adra. Blest opportunity. Aur. T'is well, this troubles me; yet sure it cannot much displease me. For who in Philanthus can find the least defect? When I perswaded him not to love Miranthe, And thought it was a friendly care, I was deceav'd. Sure then I lov'd, it could not grow thus in an instant. How in an instant, do I love him then? no no. Enter Adrastus. I do not; yet it would trouble me to see him love another Adrastus. I shall be troubled then. Adra. Maddam excuse me that I interrupt your privacie Forc'd by the violence of my passion, for when I shall be once. Certaine of that which I strongly suspect, There shall be nothing able to keep me From sudden death; not your command, Aur. Adrastus, what ist troubles you? Adra. Ist possible that you can aske me? Aur. You see I do. Adra. Maddam, you know how intirely I gave my selfe, Reserving no facultie of mind or body, to be imploy'd Other wayes then by your Discretions, nor dare I say I yet repent, tho I see another ready to reape The fruit of my labors, 'tis Philanthus happy Philanthus Whoe's the more fortunat in that hees not above me in merit, In affection far beneath me, nor should I greeve, To see him happy, were he not raisd upon my ruines. But I must say to hope to see him one day forsaken Like my self: oh no I dare not, sure this change proceeds From some defect in me which you beleeve You have found, and not from your inconstancy. Aur. Adrastus, the knowledge which I have had of your actions towards me, And my owne beauty, assur'd me that your lov'd. But that my Courtesie had bred a beleefe in you, That I desired you should do so, till now, I knew not of Henceforward I shall set a remedy to that: For Philanthus Being rais'd upon your ruins, tis a building of your fancy only. But trust me tis strange you should be Jelous of what your nere Possest: but you beleeved you did, that was sufficient. From this time know to value me and your self. In so doing, you may regain that good opinion I held of your judgment, which by this rashnesse you have lost. Exit Abra. Lost, even so I am contemned, is this the ward Of all my services, all my fair hopes Thus blasted? This Philanthus was born to ruine me In all attempts of war and peace, he robs me of prize, What ere she seemed, till Philanthus supplanted me My services were most acceptable. I had not else forsook Miranthe for her, and well I know, shee's even with me already, Furthering Philanthus, my Rivall, in his affection. Now I must look For nought but scorns from Aurelia. Could I ruine Philanthus Yet with my selfe, 'twere some content; umh, The way to do it, is, to continue the seeming friendship Which I bear him, so shall my plot be carried free From suspicion: Hee's of an open heart, And such natures are easie to work on. The Politician, when he huggs, does strike: Rivalls in Love and State, will do alike. Exit Finis Actûs primi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus. Enter Agenor and Philanthus. Phil. Sir, you have bound me to you by so many favours, That you do give me cause to hope, that this Discovery is not displeasing to you. Ag. Come, leave this ceremony, it does not fit our loves. If you do love my sister, the friendship I have vow'd, Ties me to aid you, although I know it may much Prejudice me in my Father's love, should he know't; For he so doats upon my sister, that he believes None but a god is worthy of her. Phil. 'Tis true, shee's full of all that can be excellent In women, yet so far do I prize you above mine own desires or hopes, That could your sister recompence me with a love equall to mine, And yet that love, purchast by you, prove prejudiciall to you I rather would give o're the thought of love for ever, At least in silence rather pine and die. No, far bee't from my friendship, to build my happiness, Though ne're so great, upon your smallest discontent. Ag. You wrong my love in this, and undervalue me; For, you do seem to say, I fear to hazzard my fathers frown, Though I could purchase for you what you so desire: Now, by the gods, 'twas a most unkinde thought; Nay, from a man lesse honest, 'twould appear Hypocrisie; or, do you think my youth hath not yet taught me, What 'tis to be a friend? Know, Philanthus, The few years I have past, have been employed, To make me something capable of those parts, Which most enobles us; and I have found Friendship to be the soul and essence of a man. Therefore, believe me, since for your merits I have chose you For a friend, your discontents, dangers, and happiness, Are all mine; no, friend, I say, your growing love Can plead for you, not without successe. She loves, but would not have you too assured on't, Lest it should make you lesse esteem the purchase. Phil. Sir, you in this assurance of your friendship, And her love, transport me with a double joy, Not to be exprest in words. I should fall down, And worship such a god-like friend, that thus Bestowes his favours on a desertlesse person, Made onely worthy by his love. Age. Still you forget our friendship, heaping your thanks And praise on me, a burthen my weak deserving Cannot bear without much shame; let it suffice, My love makes me a servant to your wishes; If they do take effect, 'tis your own merits, Whom the gods cannot refuse, that's the cause of it. My friendship onely a willing instrument, Strives to bring their divine wills to passe. But Oh! friend. Phil. Why sigh you, Sir? Age. I have long lik'd, and now I fear I love, And therefore think, friendship obliges me To tell you, yet with the reservation of her name: For shee's so cruell, so proud, if't be no sacriledge In me a Lover, to give that attribute. I say, shee's so disdainfull, and there's so little hope, Nay rather such a certain impossibility, That she will never love me, that I am asham'd To name the Tiger, that will in time, I know, Consume my heart. Phil. Tell me her name, and send me to her, and I shall quickly Make her know, shee's cruell to her self. Age. Oh friend, I do not wish to lose you, 'Twere the ready way to make you false; such a faith as yours Perhaps, for once, might bring you off, free and untouch'd; But should you often see her, and converse, you'd soon Break faith with me and all the world, to gain One smile from her; yet, even that smile were death, Except you might enjoy them often: the deprivation Of a good possest, being our greatest misery. Phil. Sir, may I not know this wonder, for such I must believe her, From your love; but more, that you believe she could Taint my faith. Venture to name her. Age. If you urge it as a duty, belonging to our friendship, I must tell you; otherwaies I would for some Respects conceal it. Phil. Except you mean to imploy me to serve you, 'Twill be to no advantage. Age. If you will, I'le tell you. Phil. Faith, Sir, I shall not take it ill, if you conceal her; May be, 'tis her will because her cruell usage Of you, if known, would be thought folly. Age. 'Tis her will indeed; yet, friend, she hath more wit then all her sex. Phil. Sir, were I not a Lover too, I should believe you. Age, I dare not let you see her, so to approve it; Shee'l quickly finde your worth to exceed mine. Now is my friendship from least taint most free: If she knew both, there might grow jealousie. Exeunt. Enter old Gudgen, young Gudgen, 1. Courtier, and Man. Y. Gud. Passe not beyond this score, I charge thee, Father, upon thy allegiance; we are now within the verge of the Court. Away, make haste, to turn those durty acres into crowns, to buy the place you wote of. O. G. Well son, e'en god be with thee. Y. G. Weep not, I say, but get you home, and remember my blessing to the old woman, your wife; bid her not be proud of me, though she have reason: Many a sweet-fac'd youth, like my selfe, hath miscarried at Court, comming to be a Favourite; but I'le buy't, and make sure work, I. O. G. Well, well. Y. G. What, not gone yet, I think I shall be troubled with you. Sure I was a bastard, I could not be his son, hee's such a coxcomb. 1. Like enough. Y. G. There have been Courtiers in our town, I and my mother was worth the whistling after, I can tell yee. 1. I doubt it not. Y. G. But come, how do you like me? 1. Believe me, Sir, yee'r wondrous well accoutred. Y. G. Well accoutred, is that a courtly phrase? 1. Yes. Y. G. I have heard some word neer it in the Country. And how do you like my vassail? 1. Very proper. Enter a ragged Courtier. Y. G. Is he not well accoutred? What's he, what's he, Sir? 1. Some poor sleight fellow, you must be surly to such, and look big. Y. G. Nay, Sir, I can look big, I learnt that of my father's Bull, He comes towards me. R. C. Noble Sir, I shall be wondrous proud of your acquaintance. Y. G. Then you shall never have it. R. C. Why, Sir? Enter 2. Courtiers. Y. G. Pride is a deadly vertue, humility a sin, that will better become your clothes. Look I not big? Ha! stay, what's he, what's he. 1. Some great man, by those that sue to him: you must abase your garb, and with an obsequious look salute him. Y. G. Sir, I professe my self the vassail to your Dog; if you keep none, I am a most devout and obsequious servant to your Cat. Man. I shall desire to have the providing of her Mice. 2. Sir, I am full of employments, excuse me, I must suddenly give his Grace an account. Y. G. A great man certainly, 'tis well if I can come to speak with him this two hours. 1. Sir, may I intreat to know, what place you hold in Court? this Gentleman, I can assure you, is worthy your acquaintance. Y. G. No, no, Sir; alas, I'm an ignorant, and know nothing, wondrous simple, believe it: a week hence will be fair, I'le wait your leasure. But what's your place, Sir, I beseech you honour me, Sir. 1. Pray, Sir, satisfie him. 2. Sir, I'me a favourite to his Grace. 1. What luck have you, Sir. Y. G. I, is't not good luck? Why, Sir, I come to buy a Favourites place, and think I am as fit for't as another man, and will give as much mony too. 2. Believe it, Sir, you must pay well for't, 'tis a place of great advantage. Y. G. I know't, Sir, but one may ha't for mony, I am assur'd on't. 2. Yes, you shall have mine on good conditions. Y. G. Good or ill conditions, I care not, that's all one, I'l ha't. 2. Sir, you know not yet the duties, nor the priviledges of the place. Y. G. That's true, pray what are they? 2. First, you may be alwaies next the Duke, and so advance, or else keep back suites, as you favour or dislike the person. Y. G. Nay, I'le dislike all suites, that are not like mine own. Man. or mine. Y. G. I, or thine. 2. The great men will give thee the first good-morrow, perhaps shew more respect, they are very courteous in this age: The Ladies, thei'l observe yee too, it may be, more then their husbands. Y. G. That's brave ifaith. 1. Sir, hark yee, you must not seem so desirous of it. Let me alone to talk with him, and make the bargain; let's go to the next Tavern. Y. G. Sir, I do not greatly care for this Favourites place of yours, I hear, a man shall never live in peace, my eares will alwaies be glowing; they'l do nothing but talk of me, and they'l be hang'd before they speak any good. 1. Though you deserve ne're so much. Come, let's go. 2. Nay, that's certain, they'l misinterpret every action, if it prosper not; their faith in that is like to Turks. Y. G. Sir, I would have you know, I care not ijd. for your place; but if you'l go to the next Tavern, he shall agree with you for it. 1. Fie, Sir, you'l spoyle all. 2. But is there nothing the Duke may except against, in your friend? Y. G. Except against me? 'tis impossible, he ne're saw me in's life: why should he except against me then, am not I as fit for a favourite, as another man? 2. 'Tis but a needfull objection. Y. G. Except against me? 2. Pacifie your selfe. Y. G. I tell you Sir, if he should but think of excepting against me, I would return into the Country presently, as wife as I came. 1. Nay, good Sir, 'tis impossible. Y. G. And he were ten Dukes, I'de send him to seek a Favourit, I warrant you. Except against me? what me? 1. Nay, Sir. Y. G. I tell you, Sir, should the Duke use me so, His Dukeship does not a right Gudgen know. Exeunt. Enter Adrastus and Philanthus. Adr. Believe me, noble Philanthus, there's nothing That in the passages of life hath more contented me, Then the happinesse of your friendship. The advantages of which, You have now had, at this and all other exercises, In the person of any other, would have given me cause Of griefe and envy; but since 'twas my beloved Philanthus, that rob'd me of the glory, The theft was so far from displeasing, That with the prise you won my heart too. Phi. Your friendship, Sir, does make you attribute To merit, that which was due unto my fortune only, Or rather to your policy, who by permitting Me to win this prize, thinks to encourage me Against some others, weaker then your selfe; And when I am growen something rich, by little victories o're them, You'l shew, you onely let me grow to this, That with more ease at once, you might increase your store. Adr. In this you overcome me too, but sure in love You cannot; I think, were I still certain to enjoy Your friendship, I nere should think of marriage: For to say true, how can there be, in vain Phantastick women, halfe that contentment found, That's in a perfect friend. Phil. 'Tis certain, in vain Phantastick women, there no content. But, Sir, excuse me, if I say, y'are in an errour, If you hold all women so. Adr. This moves him, I'le try him farther. Are you infected with that errour, To think, there can be any other good in women, Than onely, that they do increase mankinde? Phil. Certainly they'r good for something else. Adr. Yes, to set debate 'twixt the dearest friends, To ruine husbands in their states and honours, Nay, Kingdomes, Empires; in a word, for certain, As they bring men into the world, so certain Do they ruine all our joyes. Phil. You speak from malice, friend, I fear, not from judgment; For you must give your opinion the lie, when you consider, That our Prince that governs us had a mother, Who, whilst she lived, did govern him. Adr. It works. She was a Queen ordained by heaven and so Indeed, that she partaks none of her sexe's Ill, nor weaknesses. Name another. Phil. Shee's easily seen, did not your malice blind you; The Princesse Aurelia. Adr. As shee's a part of her divine Mother, I grant her excellent; But that laid by, shee's but a woman. Phil. But a woman, would you have her a monster, would yee? Adr. I must close with him, I am satisfied. How his blood stirs at naming her. Sir, I'le admit those two to have some worth. Phil. You had a mother Sir, and you have now a sister, Most perfect as I hear; will you bar them From all that's worthy? Enter a Servant. Ser. The Duke calls for you, he thinks your Lordships well On your journey by this time. Phil. Pray let him know no other. Adr. Dear friend, your pardon. [Exe. Adr. &amp; Ser.] Phil. I do not like this carriage of Adrastus, He makes a greater shew of love to me Then usuall, pretending a strange hatred Against the nobler sex of women; noble, because Dearest Aurelia's one. How blest am I, Though I dare onely whisper to my selfe, I am beloved by her. My plot was prosperous, &amp; shee one of my best assistants, To whose dear care I owe my happinesse, For by thy means, I did receive the first hope, That I was beloved above what she made shew of. Enter Miranthe. Mir. And from me you must receive assurance of the contrary. Phil. Ha! that Aurelia loves me not. Mir. Shee's so far from loving you now, that she Doth hate her selfe, that e're she did Phil. Oh! I am wretched, from what a pitch of happinesse Thou hast thrown me in an instant, 'twas unkindly done; yet, So soon to let me see thou hast abused me By thy flatteries, in this thou hast disturbed, More then inform'd my judgment. Mir. How? Phil. For, what care I for knowledge of that truth, That brings a certain ruine? Mir. She did love you, and may again; crosses in love are ordinary. Phil. Shee'l hear me speak, that I may know the cause, At least, of her displeasure. Mir. I know she will not, her heart's so swoln with some offences. Phil. I have no other comfort left me but my innocence Each accident doth crosse me. To morrow I must Leave the Court, to wait upon the Prince: How shall I get an opportunity to speak to her, The losse of time will ruine me, I must By Letters make her know my innocence. Mir. When you are gone, if I can learn the cause Of her displeasure, I'le write. Phil. Thou art all my comfort. Exeunt. Enter Lucinda and Linda. Luc. See, Linda, what I found too in my Cabinet, Looking indeed for one of my dear brother, Kinde Adrastus Letters. Lind. Believe me, Madam, the language of this Letter, Considering the sweetnesse of the youth that sent it, Would have moved pitty, if not procured love, From any other, but your cruell selfe. Luc. Alas, good wench, I see thou hast a tender heart; In truth I would it had been writ to thee. Lind. Well, Madam, you think none worthy but your brother Adrastus. Luc. I do indeed believe so; who equalls him in worth? And till I finde one something neer him, I shall not Think of Marriage, I assure thee; for, my beauty, Which gives place to none, will not permit me To accept a servant, that is not equall to the best deserver. Lind. Madam, though naturall affection stop your ears, Against all reports, that do not sound Adrastus praise; Yet, I by others hear, Philanthus and the young Prince, In all respects far prais'd above him. Luc. Philanthus! Lin. Why, Madam, speak you with so much scorn, hee's now Accounted the glory of the Court, a man fram'd Both for Love and Armes. Luc. Pish. Lind. You never saw him. Luc. Nor nere desire. Lind. Well, Madam, you are strangely averse, take heed Love do not lay some punishment upon you, Equall to your contempt of his great deity. Luc. Contempt of his great deity, had he a temple Standing near, dedicated to him, and to his Mother both, I would go in and yerk his little worship; Or should she say, I were not fairer then her selfe, And more to be adored, I'de break her Statue, And those, whom by my beauty are captive made, Should in th'stead of it, erect my Picture, frowning too, That any should presume to love me; yet in those Clouds, more powerfull to draw mens hearts to my devotion, Florish. Then she, with all her wanton blandishments. Exeunt. Enter Duke, Adrastus, Aurelia, Courtiers, and Servant. Duk. Daughter, me thinks you'r sad, is't for your Brothers absence—hee's now upon return. Aur. I am not sad, Sir, 'tis but your conjecture. Duk. Adrastus, are there no sports, no pleasures to delight her? Florish. Adr. None, Sir, the Court is clouded in the absent of the Prince. Duk. What means this Trumpet? one go see. Serv. A stranger Knight Sir, one that desires to be admitted to your presence. Enter Herald. Duk. Wee'l hear what he demands: What would yee? Her. Great Duke, know, that this Knight is hither come, To repair himselfe by Armes, of an injury He hath received; nor can he fear, so just a Prince As your selfe, will break an honourable custom, That hath been so long us'd amongst your Ancestours. Duk. It cannot, nor it shall not be refus'd. Her. Is Adrastus in this company? Adr. Yes, I am the man. Her. Then, Sir, my Master will maintain with his life, That you have belyed a Knight, equall to your selfe In merit, in whose behalfe hee's come to prove, That you have wickedly invented that, Which you have said of him. Adr. Though I do not know your Master, which might excuse A man of my birth; yet, confident in mine own: innocence, As having wronged no man, I do accept the Combat. Get me my Armour, nor shall it longer be deferr'd, There cannot be more noble witnesse. Duk. Adrastus, I prise you too much, to suffer it. Adr. How, Sir? then may my arms rot off, if ever I Lift them in your service; and yet my heart Misgives me in this occasion, more Then ever. Push is't not before divinest, Aurelia? I shall do wonders. Exit. Aur. What can this stranger be? or what can Be the wrong, he now seekes right of from Adrastus, Whose valour makes him famous through the world? Enter young Gudgen and his man. Y. G. Save your refulgent grace. Duk. How now, who are you? Y. G. A poor favourit of you graces, that desires to be better acquainted. Duk. A favourit of mine, how came you so? Y. G. Knowing my selfe fitly qualified, and well accoutred, as they say, I made bold to venture a summe of mony. Duk. Is this he? 2. Yes, Sir. Duk. I am bound to you, it seemes you love me well, that would buy my service, venturing in it my refusall of yee too. Y. G. Yes, in good faith, I love yee very well; I have heard in the Country a good report of you; besides, y'are bound to love me too, by my place. Duk. Who swore you, your own imagination? Y. G. Swore me, why, do you misdoubt me? I warrant yee, Sir, I'l execute it rarely—Stand by there, the Duke is busie, another time hee'l hear you. Duk. We shall be troubled with this Asse. Y. G. Take away this fellow, you hear what the Duke saies, Duk. Take him away, this is not a time for fooling I am serious. Y. G. Your grace is wise, 'tis true indeed. See the Councill-Chamber made ready, 'tis a businesse of great importance, worthy your fear. I would old father were here, we two would advise you rarely ifaith. Duk. Away, coxcomb. Y. G. He has a villanous head of his own, hee'l tell you how many acres of land are in your Dukedome, and never measure it. Duke. How? Y. G. Another shall measure it for him. Cour. Away with this fool. [strikes up Gudgens heels.] Y. G. Slight! what do you use a young Gentleman and a favourite thus, that comes out of his meer love to Court? 2. Hee's quite discouraged, that rude fellow hath spoil'd all. 1. Not a whit, if I do not raise him to a beliefe above what he had, ne're trust my skill. Y. G. 'Twas you Sir, that made me believe, I should rise at Court. 1. Why, so you do; but you are no ordinary Favourite, they rise first, and fall after commonly; but you shall rise after your fall. Florish, Charge. 2. 'Tis not without example. Exeunt. Enter Adrastus and Philanthus. Duk. Are the Knights ready? 1. Yes, Sir, see where they enter. Duk. Then let the justice of the injured's cause protect them [they fight.] 1. Was ever seen a braver Combat? Duk. 'Twere pitty to lose such Knights, perhaps their quarrell, Truly understood, may not be great. Aur. The stranger does appear the braver. Duk. I fear Adrastus. Sweet daughter, make tryall of your power, To stay the Combat, 'tis an an office will become you. Aur. Most willingly. Sir, I beseech you hold. She pulls him, and he turning suddenly, her fear makes her fall; he offering to help her, Adrastus comes behind; but he recovering himself, laies Adrastus at his feet. Phil. Traitor, this basenesse will expresse thee. Aur. Hold, Sir, I adjure you by her whom you Best love, give me his life. Phil. Let him confesse the wrong he has basely Done to me, and her whom you adjure me By; and he shall live by your command, Though far unworthy to be so obliged. Adr. I am dead else, I do, or any thing. Phil. Live then, to be more miserable then death could make thee. Duk. Be carefull of Adrastus, but see this stranger Receive no injury, from any of Adrastus friends. Though ye have fought with one that we love dearly, Yet, I so much admire your courtesie And valour, that I should think my Court Much honoured by your stay. Florish. Adr. Friends, if you love me or my fortunes, revenge me, The way I leave to your discretion. Friends. Enough, wee'l die or doot', Notwithstanding the Dukes command. Ex. omnes Finis Actûs secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus tertius. Enter Lucinda and Linda. Luc. Lighted that arm'd Knight that rid so fast by, at that little house? Lin. Hee did Maddam, this fine day hath tempt you To walke further then you think: they say there's often Robberies done in this wood. Luc. Alas poor wench art afraid. Enter Adrastus, Friends. Luc. What are these that make this haste. Oh Maddam, theeves I feare. 1. Saw you a Knight ride by here, dear Lady ist you? Luc. Well met sir, yes I saw him, how does my brother? Oh speak, I long to know, I dreamt of him to night. 1. Maddam I fear your brother is no more. Luc. Ha? dead? Oh speak it not, for I shall bear him companie. 1. Rather shew us which way that Knight went, the Author of his death. That so we may revenge his murther. Luc. Oh heavens, murder'd? yet you are just ye powers That makes me thus the instrument of his revenge. I will not wash this hand kercher in womanish teares, But first in the murderers blood, then clense it againe With tears for my dear Brother. 2. But Maddam, which way went he? Luc. Ile bring you where you cannot misse him, tis Not long since I saw him enter a little house. As we came walking hither. Enter an old man, and an old woman. Wom. Now his wounds are drest, hee sleeps soundly. Man. Alas good gentleman, he takes our poore entertainment kindly. He said at first he would come hither when he went to fight. Wom. I wonder his man that drest him, staies so long. Enter Lucinda, Linda, and friends. 'Tis not far to the next Town. O Man. What are these? theeves? 1. Stop their mouths, he sleeps, shall I strike him dead? Luc. No let me see the Murderer first, sure he looks ugly. You need not kill him, let the law seise on him. 2. Maddam I would not have him wake, hee's stout. 'Twil not be in our powers to compell him. By all the gods, 'tis Philanthus, but he shall die. Luc. Stay—it must be by my hand, no other. I am most injur'd, and so most interested in the revenge. 1. Alas you are not able. Luc. Leave it to me, or else by all that's sacred: Ile lay you open to the Law give me your Dagger: Retire and leave me. 1. Alas Maddam you. Luc. Are you such fooles, not to be content To have a dangerous enterprise effected, and your selves Freed from danger of the Law, none will suspect me. 2. Maddam, if he should wake. Luc. Stay you without, and if you hear me call For help: come in, not, otherwise. 1. We dare not disobey you, her own great spirit And the much love she beares her brother, makes her, Forget her sex. 1. But we shall lose your thanks, since she performs it. 2. Not a whit, he shall not know it for us, how ere Shee's a witness of our zeal to doo't; and we are free From danger of the Law, if ever the deed be known. Enter Lucinda. Luc. 'Tis done, away, he welters in his blood, lean all to me. 2. But what for these? Luc. Fie, no, 'tis unnecessary, by giving Gold, Ile make them speechless ever, but now I better Think, beare them into some wood and bind them But hurt them not. 1. Maddam, 'tis possible, your brother may not yet be dead. How ere this act will please him much. Lu. Not dead? this may be malice, then if it be known, I'le Justifie the Act, if not the thanks and recompence. Be you from him. Ile send, and know the truth of all. Lin. Oh Maddam I never thought you could have done a wickednesse like this. The wounds which you have given will strike Your own soul deep one day. Lin. Oh fool the wounds I have received are far more dangerous, Then those that I have given. Lin. Maddam your own hand's cutt. Luc. 'Tis so, all the blood thou seest came only from thence. Let me with better leasure looke on what I have preserv'd. His travell makes him sleep sound. Lin. Madam, how blest were you to change your cruel resolution. Some Angell prompted you to save him from those Murderers, by seeming, as if you did your selfe intend to be one. Luc. There was no other way; but the good angell That prompted me, was Love; 'twas strange I should Be taken by a sleeping man, that have from all eyes That have seen me, almost banished sleep, To think upon my beauty, which must be now My part for him; for, I have lost my selfe By saving him, since I am sister to his enemy. Yet, he may love like me, when he intends revenge: But shall I be so lovely when I sleep, and he behold Some stand ready to murder me, so making Pitty usher love into his heart, as into mine? For all waies else have been before attempted To make me amorous, none prevailed: Oh no, It cannot be, he stirrs, away. I must do something, What, I cannot tell: Who loves, and dares not say, he lives in hell. [Exeunt. Enter Aurelia and Miranthe. Aur. Miranthe, have you known valour, and so little courtesie, meet in the person of one man so fully, As in this Knight that overcame Adrastus? Mir. Madam, his valour did appear to all, But wherein he behaved himselfe discourteously, I am yet to learn. Aur. What Knight but he, would have refused to stay Their Combat, when I, a Princesse, Not to be contemn'd, besought him? Mir. Oh, Madam, how unjust you are, since you accuse him In that, wherein you ought to thank him? You saw, when through your fear you fell, he turn'd To take you up, by which he did receive A wound, I fear too mortall, by that most base Adrastus; and if he had given o're the Combat Afterward, when you desired, his enterprise Had been most vain from the beginning: Adrastus had not then confest, that you or any Might have heard, the lies he had invented. But Philanthus is most unfortunate, to have His best deservings still misinterpreted. Aur. How! was't Philanthus that fought? me thought indeed, The voice was his, but he being thought so far off, Kept me from being certain. Mir. It scap'd my tongue before I was aware, Now I must make it good. Yes, Madam, it was Philanthus, To whom I did give notice in a Letter, How much Adrastus injured you and him, By saying, Philanthus boasted of the great love You bare him, in every place, and that you partly did Believe, he spake but truth, which was the cause Of your displeasure. Aur. Is't then Philanthus hath done me this displeasure? Durst he put my honour on the hazzard of fortune? Durst he capitulate and make conditions, When I did beg Adrastus life? am I so miserable, That I was gladder to receive, then he to give What I did ask? Mir. Oh poor Philanthus, how happy art thou, if the wound Thou didst receave, helping her up, have freed Thee from those greater torments, which her cruelty Prepares, in recompence of all thy faithfull services. But, Madam, when I think on't, did not you say, He was to right himselfe with his sword, if he knew No other remedy; and with more secrecy, or more Discretion, it was to bar the action, all Thinking Philanthus to be far hence, Even when he drew their eyes to wonder at his valour. Aur. Peace, no more of him, you praise him without cause. Mir. Without cause? When as his death, caus'd by your cruelty, More then his wounds, shall make the world know, 'Twas he that overcame Adrastus, and for your sake, As well as for his own. How will the vertuous People tax you, of your great injustice? Aur. I must confesse, I should be very sorry his death Should give the world a knowledge of my follies. Mir. Be not you cruell to him, and prevent it. Aur. Nay, let him love himself, and save me a labour. Mir. Madam, he cannot love that, which he thinks you hate. Aur. Hee's neither worthy of my hate nor love. Mir. Madam, 'tis impossible there should be that indifferency Towards Philanthes, whom you must either love, Or hate extreamly. Enter Agenor. Aur. Well then, I do not hate him, my brother; upon your life Let him not know, that I do know the stranger was Philanthus. Miranthe, seek not to excuse him, hee's a most Discourteous Knight, and I do hate him deadly. Age. Who's that shee speaks of? Mir. The stranger-Knight. Age. Believe me, sister, you had no reason. Aur. Well, Sir, I know mine own reasons best. Age. But, sister, when you hear mine, which are stronger, You'l be of another minde. Aur. You may as soon perswade the fixed Starrs To move, as me from my opinion. 'Twas sure Some inchantment that overcame Adrastus. Age. Then you'l abandon reason quite, this truely showes, You women think your foes your friends, your friends your foes. Exeunt. Enter Philanthus, and Lucinda's Servants. Phil. Villains, for what respect is't, that you do preserve Me longer to torment me? why did you not rather Kill me, when you found me steeping first? Ser. 'Twas not in our commission, you are reserved to feel A thousand torments, to which death is a pleasure. Phil. From what person living have I deserved such usage? Ser. I'le let you know your misery, the more to torment you. Know, that we are servants to a Lady, the most malitious And deformed, that ever lived; so great An enemy to vertue, that 'tis her onely study To destroy those men in whom it doth inhabit. Her vigilancy for mischiefe is ever busie. It seemes she hath found you out to wreak her spight upon, Intending here to keep you ever, except she shall Prove mercifull, and kill you. Phil. If her hate to me onely proceed from a beliefe, That I am vertuous, it seems she knowes me not, I am not such. But if thou beest a gentle villain, Tell me, where I am. Ser. Far from the house, in which we found you fleeding, And now in the most loathed Prison, that ever eyes Beheld, if eyes can be of use in so much darknesse; Your chiefest companions must be Toads, Snakes, And Froggs, except two villains sometimes, as now, ready stand, To Inflict torments, that cannot be exprest. Phil. Oh that I could but see, and were unloos'd, that with my fist I might reward thee for this kinde relation. Ser. Screech Owles and Ravens, shall fill thy ears continually With dismall sounds. Hark. Recorders. Phil. Sure some power, pittying the misery that I must suffer, Gives me this farewell to all happinesse. Ser. Now begins your torments, but that they may be more Sensible, let him see him his misery. [they unvail him. Phil. Amazment seizes me, is this a loathed Prison? Or this the harsh and dismall notes of wicked birds? Or look these men as they would stab, rather adore me. What do I fool my selfe, this is a dream. I am sure asleep. Ser. Propose your wishes, and we are ready to effect them, As far as lies in human power. Phil. This is no dream, I am awake, this is my hand, And these my hairs, I feel pain, now I pull them. Sure 'tis a vision, or worse inchantment; the wicked Mistresse Of this house, to all her other ills, is certainly a witch. Enter Lucinda. I am confirmed 'tis so, for here she comes, Changed in a form equall to Aurelia, and far more Gently does she look upon me, than she did at our parting. Luc. Sir, you are welcome, if there be defect in any thing, It comes from negligence of servants, not from my will. A valiant Knight, and flie thus from a Lady! Phil. What should I fear, she cannot hurt my mind With all her art, how ere she may my person. Besides, shee'l change her form, and look before she do me ill. This shape can nought produce, that can offend. Luc. Pray you sir, sit. Phil. I will. Luc. Not so far off, if you please. Phil. You think I fear. Luc. No, Sir; but I perceive, you are not confident of what you see. Sir, recollect your self; for what you heard Before from these, was but what I directed, With an intent indeed, to set off, as with a foil, This mean but hearty entertainment. Phil. I dare not trust you, you speak too well, To mean well, since I am a stranger, And no way have deserved these favours. Ser. My Lady, Sir, hath told you truth. Luc. Save your pains, leave us, I'le clear his understanding. Exeunt Servants. Phil. The danger now approches, if she be a witch. Wickednesse desires no witnesse. Luc. Sir, if ere you lov'd, which yet I wish you had not Then the discourse I am to make, will with more ease Approach your understanding, and soon gain belief. I am a Lady as you see, not much deform'd; The Servants and the stuff here are not borrowed, Nor will it hurt my state thus daily to entertain Such, as I make my friends; and such my birth is, As bids me live thus without tax of pride. I am mine own disposer, no Parents to blame My disobedience, though my choice should only Please my selfe: They live not, or if they did, My fortune was not wholly left by them. Phil. You are in a happy state, since you have power To make some noble spirit fortunate, and you in him. Sure she is really what she relates. Luc. I might have been most happy, if my unlucky Starrs Had not in one particular crost me. Phil. Your courtesie obliges me, to ask you wherein? I vow she weeps, the tears, like Orientall Pearls, Drop from her eyes making a path down Her most lovely cheeks, that may direct the looker on, If lost in wonder, as I am, to finde the way Back to those heavenly springs, from whence all treasure Flowes, rich above Tagus, or what poets ever fain'd Speak, gentle Lady, why this sorrow? Luc. They are not tears of sorrow, but of anger, To see my liberty thus lost, that liberty, Which I have so much prised, as some have thought There was just cause to think me proud, and then to lay My selfe and all my fortunes, even at mine enemies feet. Oh misery, have I not cause, think you, to weep, And curse my cruell Stars, that force me to do this? Phil. I must confesse, 'tis a hard fate for to be subject To ones enemy: But sure your merits have the power to turn That enmity to friendship, if you please. Be plain, and let me know your meaning; And, with the hazard of my life, I'le serve you. Luc. Then thus: I hated you above all creature living, The cause seek not to know, for 'tis impossible; nay came With an intent to see you murder'd; but when I saw you, Though you then slept, the graces all, me-thought, Dwelt in you face, and so protected you from harm; That I that came with all that malice, became Your sole preserver, and not content with that, streight way I made you absolute commander of me and mine. Phil. You amaze me. Luc. But not intending that you e're should know me, Nor the place of my abode, if you return'd not love, I made my servants bring you thus blind fold Hither, left you might boast my love hereafter. Phil. Madam, 'tis a most strange discourse that you have made, And yet you so deliver it, that I must think it Truth; but what to answer, I am ignorant. 'Tis best I should be plain, since you desire to be so. Then must you know, that my unhappy Starrs Make me uncapable to receive the unequall treasure, Which you offer in your rich selfe. A Lady, like your selfe, To say more fair, were false, hath long since rob'd Me of the power, to be my own disposer. Luc. I fear'd indeed, that so much worth as you are Master of, Could not be undispos'd of, since where's that woman Would not use her utmost art, to gain a servant, That she might so justly glory in. I desire to know Her name yet, that I may pay her beauty and her wisdome, That respect it merits, for loving you. Phil. Madam, I must not; but, trust me, shee's too wise to love Me still, for she hath found me now of late, much 'much Defective; but I do hope, my constancy will Make supply; for, I vow, my affection and my life have But one date. Luc. Say you so, this protestation hath much lessened The opinion I held of your worth: Perhaps you say This, to avoid my importunity, which I do too much Apprehend. I am no ravisher; may be, when you shall see Some greedily pursue what you do, with such scorn, refuse, And those perhaps your equalls, you'l finde too late, You fondly have pursued your misery, and fled From a great happinesse, and begin to make you Feel your folly I'le tie you to this hard condition, As I believe you will account it. Phil. What is't, Lady? there's but one womans threatning, That can affright me. Luc. Say you so, I'le try that; tell me that womans name, The place of her abode, or by my hopes of happinesse, I'le make you the most miserable man alive; For, you shall never see again, what you so covet and enjoy. Phil. You are witty in your anger, this is no effect of that great love, That you profest; it may be, time will make me Better know your worth. Me-thinks you look more lovely Then you did, though at the first fair. Luc. Oh Sir, do you begin to flatter: Her name, name, And with it, liberty; if you deny, to prison. Phil. No other way. Luc. None, as I live; can you expect from me, the injur'd, Any favour? Could I invent a way more to afflict ye You should be sure to feel it. Phil. What shall I do? the choice is hard: How can this any way advantage you? Luc. If she be more deserving than my selfe, I shall not then repine to be refused; if lesse, Contemn you for your folly; and do not fear, That I will make another partner of The secret, which may be troubles you. Phil. If I have not lost it, I am happy; read the direction of this Letter. Luc. Let's see't. Phil. Aurelia made me so direct my Letters, so to deceive, If any by misfortune should be seen. Luc. To the fair hands of the most admired Lucinda. How's this? he must not see my blushing, this cannot be It may; How? I am transported betwixt joy and fear? Swear by the gods, Lucinda is the creature you most affect. Phil. There's no help, shee's too wise to be deceived. Luc. Come, swear. Phil. By Aurelia's selfe, the greatest oath, I love no other then Aurelia. Luc. All my hopes thus again vanisht. You are free Enter Servants. And I the most unfortunate. Sir, you must be contented, They bear you back as you came hither; and think, What you have seen or heard, was but a dream. [Exit. Phil. Thus I refuse, cruell Aurelia, for thy sake, A beauty, that the powerfull gods might rivalls make. Ser. Sir, we must bear you many leagues hence. Phil. Even where you please. Exeunt. Enter the two Courtiers. 1. He's stark mad, with the conceit of his Favourits place. 2. You'l ne're make him know himselfe. 1. The better : you see, he makes good sport at Court. 2. Take heed, it may be there are some that do believe, you brought him to mock them. 1. If there be any there so simple to believe that, then I have personated those I know not of, &amp; I am glad on't 2. I, but to touch upon the name or actions of a Favourit, may bear equall danger with those of Princes. 1. If this fool Favourit of ours do trouble any other, tell them, that Jewells receive their lustre from a foyl; if then not satisfied, they're neer a kin to him in judgment, and envious to me; yet, I forgive them, knowing their malice cannot hurt my innocence, who rather wish to receive an injury my selfe, then touch at any, whose fooling is not their greatest merit; I mean, their onely hope of rising. Here comes our Gallant. Enter Gudgen and his Man. Y. G. Tell my Lords man, I am wondrous busie, and cannot speak with him these two hours. Man, I will, an't please your honour. He's stark mad, but I must humour him. 2. What Lord's man? 1. There's none to speak with him, 'tis his fancy. Y. G. In good faith, Sir, I cannot do't for you. Man. I am very sorry for't. Y. G. I must not waste my stock of favour, on so unreasonable businesses. Greater profit. I, ye say true; I know it will be the greater profit: But, Sir, 'twill likewise raise much envy against me, and I am not very well setled; the great men apprehend the danger of my rising, and study how to give a stop to all my hopes. Man. Very like, Sir. Y. G. Oh, Sir, assure your selfe, in any other thing I shall be ready to serve you. Farewell, noble Sir. Man. Now I must go. Y. G. Pox o'this coxcomb, why does he trouble me? Yet, 'tis good policy to speak him fair to his face, I may have use of him. Please your grace, this is a friend of mine, a deserving man. Man. Alas, Sir. Y. G. I humbly thank your grace. Your suit is granted. Max. Is it? Y. G. But with great difficulty. Sir, this mans suit is most impertinent, himself an idle, ill natur'd, and seditious fellow; I have known him long. Away, y'are sawcy. Madam, your husband shall have the place, I vow 'tis for your sake onely. Command you? no, Madam. I'le wait on you at your lodging, sweet Madam. Gentlemen, you must pardon me, I cannot hear you now, you see his grace hath sent for me in haste, pray tell him that I come. You are importunate, Get the Coach there hoe. Man. Yes, Sir. Exeunt. 2. This is direct madnesse, and yet he speaks more sense, than ere he did in his life, but that he speaks to no body. 1. Nay, th'Ass is strangely mixt; sometimes he will have starts of wit, that would almost cousen a man. 2. He would passe for a very accomplished Gentleman amongst some women; but that his hoping to be a Favourit discovers him. Enter Gudgen and his Man. Y. G. Slave, not my Coach ready? 2. What, the scene's chang'd now, the Lady is Sprat again. Y. G. My Coach, thou cur. Man. How many horses, Sir? Y. G. Six, thou peasant. Man. An't please your honour, will not Cut, and your father's dung-Cart serve to day, I'le be the Coachman. Y. G. Be dumb, thou traitor, dost thou not know, Obedience, not advice, belongs to servants; but I will teach thee how to be malepert, thou Brock. 1. Nay, Sir, for this time let me beg his pardon; besides, Sir, spend not your rage so poorly. Hark you, Sir. Y. G. How? 1. It must be so, your reputation is in danger else; a Favourit must be noble, of a great spirit, carelesse of danger. Y. G. Why, Sir, then I am right; I care so little for danger, I would ne're come near it; and if danger approach me, it had better keep farther off, it shall be sure of cold entertainment. 1. You are wise, Sir, I believe it. Y. G. Wise, I would have you know, Ere all be done, the world shall think me so. 1. I, Sir, we find the weight of it. Exeunt. Finis Actûs tertii.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quartus. Enter Philanthus. Phil. How strange a fortune have I run, since I did leave The Court; but it most vexes me, to be ungratefull to Her, that sav'd my life, though not by love; yet there Might be some other way to serve her, did I know Her name. Why, sure me thinks I'me free, since 'tis her will, That barrs me from the means, to know her. I have No comfort left, but in the faithfull friendship of the Prince. His Sister is become cruell, I fear unconstant. Adrastus, how will he entertain me? Enter Adrastus. Adr. Ha, is't his ghost, or he himselfe? he lives! my hopes are vain. Phil. What means he, he cannot suspect 'twas I that overcame him. Adr. I must dissemble. My dearest friend, where have you been These many daies? How it joyes me to have you in these arms? A Serpent or a Fury had been more welcome. The Court, Sir, languishes in your absence, and reason, Wanting you, the lustre of it. Phil. Rather in your sicknesse, Sir; Now you are well, it will recover quickly. Adr. You have heard, it seemes, of my dysaster. Phil. I heard, Fortune envying your worth, became your enemy. But, was the Combat equall, had he no odds in Horse nor Armes? Adr. Something there was in that, but my respect to the Princesse Was most prejudiciall to me; yet since, she hath Requited me, with so much love and care of my health, That I esteem my selfe most happy to have received those wounds, And with them, such assurance of her affection. Phil. How's this? Adr. I'l vex his soul with jealousie? Phil. It cannot be. Adr. If he accuse me for these words, I'le combat him, And so recover my honour lost, or lose my life. 'Twas fortune, not his valour, that o'recame me. Phil. Oh woman, woman, what art thou? Adr. Philanthus, what is't that troubles you? if any secret griefe, Discover it to me, whom you may boldly trust; For I have told you, what to no other creature Living I would discover, though wrack'd. Phil. I am wrack'd indeed. Adr. Come, speak man, be free, my friendship to you does command it. Phil. I am of a sudden sick. Adr. And that's my case: How I could hug my selfe for this? Phil. Your pardon, Sir, I am not very well, I'le to my Chamber. Adr. Shall I wait on you? Phil. By no means. Ex: Adr. A fine excuse, alasse poor shallow lover. Fortune, why dost thou thus assist an ignorant Against me? Why should she love him, and neglect me Thus, that am so much in Art his Master? he has a smoother face, And more youth about him; th'Adamants, That draw a giddy Lady. I see him comming back, I do not like it; I'le make as if I did not see him. Enter Philanthus. Phil. Friend. He goes away. Adrastus. Adr. I cannot hear. Exit. Phil. He will not hear. How base a wretched thing Is a dissembler of which Adrastus is the chiefe. With what a shew of love he entertain'd me, As if his soul were joy'd at sight of me; When by the lie he did invent of me, and of the Princesse, I know he hates me: What a madnesse is it then in me, To believe that, which he spoke of her love to him; He's sure too cunning to discover it, if it were true, To me especially. Child that I was, I now finde out his plot, Suffering my passion to give him an assurance Of my affection to Aurelia, which before He onely could suspect.—See the sweet Prince. Enter Agenor. Age. Thou partner of my soul, where hast thou been? Phil. Oh Sir, the strangest fortune hath befalln me, since I received your Letter, that ever man encountred, Too long to be told you now. But how go matters at Court? What say they of the stranger, I mean, of me? Age. My sister most unjustly hates you, and no perswasions Can as yet alter her, as y'are a stranger too. I left her with a Gipsie and his daughter, who tells The strangest things that e're were heard; indeed he tels You almost what you can desire to know, mens fortunes past, And, I think, that which is to come too, if he please: Sure hee's really a Conjurer, Phil. I long to see and talk with this rare man, But more your beautious sister, if she will dain To cast her heavenly eyes on so despis'd a subject. Age. Come, fear it not, time will pacifie that unjust anger, That she conceiv'd against you. Phil. I fear she is unconstant. Age. If she love any other, nay, if she love not Philanthus, She's no more my sister, but in name; a stranger To my blood and my affection. Phil. I do fear, if there be any body by, they'l discover By my distemper, the affection, which except to your dearselfe, I have from all concealed. Age. It shall be as you desire it. Come, leave these down-cast looks; I could complain of my hard fate in love; Here's a greater witnesse of my Mistresse scorn than ever, She almost swears here never to love me; There was some hope before, but I forget. Each one in his owne cause is tedious, Taxes an other that's guilty in the same. Exeunt Enter Aurelia, Adrastus, Miranthe, Linda, and a Gipsie. Aur. Come, Sir, what can you say to this hand? Gip. You have been much in love, and there was cause You should be so, your servant was most worthy. But you of late have been unkinde, perhaps You love another; I can, but will not tell you at this time. Aur. This is partly truth. Shew him your hand Mir. I defie him to tell any thing of me. Gip. Y'are a good dull soul, you neither think of love nor hate; To wait upon your Lady is all your pleasure. Aur. In troth 'tis true. Lind. Pray, Sir, look on mine. Gip. Y'are wondrous amorous, and have already chang'd Three Servants, the better for the worse still. Aur. Upon my knowledge, Sir, you have told most certain truth. Enter Agenor. Age. 'Save yee, sister. Can this man tell any thing? Sir, shew your skill on me, but to my selfe; I would not have them heare what you conjecture: More I know you cannot of no mans fortune. Gip. You'l straight believe the contrary, your hand's So easie, that I could almost tell every particular Of your whole life; at least, your passages Of love, which is the skill that I professe. Age. Let's hear. Aur. Adrastus, hath he seen your hand yet? Adr. No, Madam, 'tis to no purpose, he can tell nothing. Aur. I am not of your minde. It seemes my brother Will not have us know his fortune. Gip. You were in love at seven years old, as much as that age Could admit, and have continued the most constant living, Upon the smallest hopes; and 'tis not long since You received a great discouragment, yet still you love, And much I fear in vain. Age. 'Tis true, this makes me admire your skill. Gip. You are as true a friend, as y'are a lover too, And you in that will be unfortunate. Age. It is impossible. Gip. I may fail, but I speak according to my art. Adr. What think you of him? Age. I think him a rare man. Adr. I'le see if he can make me think him so. Now, Sir, shall I intreat you to shew your skill. Gip. You will not have me speak aloud. Adr. Why not aloud? Gip. I will not; you have been a lover more then once, and still Unfortunate; first, by your own unconstancy, your quarells Too, have been no advancement to your reputation lately; And more disgraces shall light on you, till you return Unto your first affection: the gods are much displeased. Be good, and reconcile your selfe to heaven. Adr. A strange fellow, but I'le seem to contemn him. The most ignorant might have told what he tells me, Of which number I believe him one. Gip. Say you so, pray let me see your hand once more. Adr. Well, Sir. Gip. Your own arme being too weak to defend you against your enemy, I finde, you basely have employed the armes of others. Adr. Ha! Gip. I finde something like a murder written in this Line. Adr. This fellow is a devill; besides, I see my falshood does not thrive. Aur. What saies he to you? Adr. He is indeed a rare man, and I recant, And much esteem him and his skill. Age. I see he has told you things that please you. Adr. He has so. Exit. Age. Sister, if you love me. Aur. Well, you know I can deny you nothing; I would not see him else. How I long to speak with him, yet I'le torment him too. It troubles me to think, my brother divides The channell of his love, which else would wholly Run in one continued stream to me. Enter Agenor. I esteem you learned above all those I ever saw or heard of. This evening, Sir, wee'l talk at better leasure. Now I desire all to retire and leave me. [Exeunt Gipsie, and Maids. Now, brother, where is Philanthus? Age. Friend. Enter Philanthus. Phil. How I tremble: Were I to enter Combat against a Lion, Nay, against an Hoste of men, me-thinks I should not Be thus fearfull. I know, 'tis not my part To play the passionate Lover, shee'l laugh at me. But I have lost that power I had over my passion, By her unkindnesse, nor can I hide the sorrows of my heart. she offers to go away. Age. Whither, sister, did not you promise to hear him? Aur. Whom? Age. Philanthus. Aur. Yes; but I see nothing but a statue, there's neither Sound nor motion comes from that. Phil. It is your cruelty that hath transform'd me then. Dear Madam, tell me, from what can grow this alteration? If any false report have done it, 'tis great injustice To believe an enemy wronging a friend, and not To hear that friend first answer for himselfe. Aur. Philanthus, I do not complain at all, why do you go about To justifie your selfe, before you be accused? Phil. Madam, why am I then banished from Your presence, and your favour? Aur. 'Twas your occasion drew you from the Court, For ought I know; and for my favour, I never Doated on you, nor do I hate you now. Age. Yet, sister, this cold answer does not become That love, which you, on my knowledge, desir'd, That he should think you bear him. Aur. Brother, I must acknowledge, that I love and honour Philanthus merits; But yet, I take it, I never so far did engage my self, As not to be my own disposer; and you too far Interest your selfe, in being more a friend to him than me. Age. As how? Aur. You blind my judgment, which should wholly direct me in my choice: For he whom you commend of reasonable parts, Must from me again respect above the best deserver. And much I wonder, that Philanthus will call in question His own merits, for so he does in my opinion, to use you, As a secondary means, since if he be a man deserves my love, I hope he thinks, that I have wit to know it. Phil. Madam, 'twere ignorance in me, or any other, to plead other Desert, than readinesse to obey; and fortune enviously To me, hath still denyed such an occasion, as might let you see, The greatest danger should to me seem none, Where I might hope to do you any service. Aur. Your promises are large, and I may perhaps Meet with employment. Phil. Madam, if so, I shall beleeve my selfe most happy. Age. Well, dear sister, use him kindly. Aur. Brother, you did desire, that I should give him hearing, None by but you: I will exceed that favour, And wish to enjoy his company alone; pray leave us. Age. Most willingly. Exit. Aur. You may stay, Sir, if you please, except you fear To be alone with me. Phil. Madam, why fear, what danger? Aur. More then you think, I must impart a businesse to you In which I shall make tryal of The great love that you professe. Phil. I am blest, if you be serious; though I should Perish in what you employ me, I must Account my end most fortunate. Aur. You must swear to perform what I enjoyne you, According to your power. Phil. Madam, I vow't, if it be not against mine honour. I value you above my life, but lesse then that Aur. Well. Phil. One exception more, and then be what it will. Aur. What's that? Phil. Not to command me to cease to love you. Aur. Oh! fear it not; and yet I will not promise to love you, Not when you have performed, what I shall now enjoyne; Yet, I confesse, the service will be most acceptable: Nor must you make my Brother, though your dearest friend, Partaker of the secret. Phil. That's worst of all. Aur. Swear. Phil. I do. Aur. Then know, that I do hate that Knight, that overcame Adrastus, More then I love my beauty or my health. Phil. How? Aur. This cannot chuse but pinch him. And do enjoyne you By your oath, to find him out, and so deliver him into my hands, That I may have still power to punish him as I think fit. Phil. And, Madam, wherefore do you hate him? I heard, His actions did not deserve it. Aur. For his discourtesie, and neglect of me. Phil. Know you of what Country he is? Aur. No. Phil. Oh, Madam, I finde your plot, you know you shall Still be importuned by my love, which will Not give me leave, to let you live in peace; And therefore you have set me on this uselesse task. You are witty in your cruelty. Aur. Not onely so, for I desire to be reveng'd upon that Knight. Phil. Will't content you if I kill him? Aur. No, his punishment I reserve unto my self, The way to bring him hither, to your own discretion; By force, or by entreaty, as you please. And so I leave you. Think on your oath, remember too I promise no reward. Phil. Nor may I hope one neither. Aur. You are your own disposer. Phil. At least allow me this encouragement. Why should I strive to please this scornfull she, that hates me; Nay, hates me, when I do deserve all love? The beautious Lady of the Castle did not so. Am I not by the gods thus punished, for my ingratitude to her? yes. Certainly, she sav'd my life: Her beauty is not much inferiour, Her wit seemes equall; how e're, she ought To be esteemed by me much more. But where's she, Or what is she, I know not, onely I feel her growing here, here, [flourish] in my heart. Enter Duke, Agenor, Aurelia, Courtiers. Duk. This custome shall no longer be of use; The last Combat was granted, it seemes, Hath drawn on this. Age. Your Court will be dishonoured by the refusall. Shall it be said, You protect those, who do wrong To others, when the guilt perhaps makes them Too feeble to defend themselves. Duk. Well, be it as you will, I am innocent Of any blood, that shall this day be shed. Age. Let the Knight enter. Enter Gudgen and his Man. Duk. How, Gudgen my favourit? nay, then there's no great danger: Meant you 'twas he? Which of the women will he challenge? Aur. Nay rather, how many men at all these weapons. Y. G. Speak your prose first, and see you be not out, before you begin your leggs. Man. No, I warrant you, Sir, I'le make my sirreverences very sweetly. Age, Something long a beginning. Y. G. Take heed your tongue do not discover you. Man. No, nor my tail neither, I warrant you, as I'le tell it. Y. G. Remember, born a great way off. Man. I, I, and not christened; for you are a Turk you know. Aur. Now he begins. Man. Most doughty Duke. Master, what must I call you? Y. G. Coxcomb. Man. Oh! Y. G. Shouldst not name me. Man. Most doughty Duke, my Master Coxcomb whom you see. Y. G. Oh slave. Man. Is come to Court, to shew his chivalry against. Y. G. Speak softly. Man. Against speak-softly, servant to your grace. Y. G. Bernardo, servant to your grace, you fool. Man. Bernardo, servant to your grace, you fool whom if he be within this dismall place, I him defie, throwing the monstrous lie into his ugly throat. Age. Good poetry. Man. And should he come, I would not be ins' coat: For sure my Master, who is come thus far, Will kill him dead before he be aware. I am his mouth, and I do tell you from him, My Master, if he come, will soundly bum him. Y. G. Wooll a? Man. And therefore keep away, if you be wise; Till I my Trumpet have forth-sounded thrice. Phil. Me-thinks the Knight should speak for himselfe. Y. G. I do not understand a word of your language. Duk. Hard luck, how far was your Knight born? Y. G. Be sure you say far enough, they'l I know me else. Man. I warrant ye. Beyond the worlds end. Age. How many miles may that be? Man. Forty good miles, and more. His Father? Y. G. Peace, sound again, I am in some fear. Aur. Hee'l learn to speak anone. Y. G. It seemes the enemy dares not approach; if he do, I'le send him after those ten Knights that I kill'd in Thrace, singly, man after man, though they assaulted me all at once. Phil. That's strange. Y. G. I, at one blow, with this rusty sword, rusty with being continually imbrued in blood of bruitish beasts, Man. Indeed he kill'd a mad Bullock once. Y. G. Clove to the teeth a monstrous high and mighty mastiff Dog, of a Leminian Lion's hide. Age. A Cow's perhaps his father was a Butcher. Y. G. Sound the third time. Not yet, how base is he, that dares do injurie, but much more base, that dares not justifie his wickednesse. Not yet? Phil. Now he speaks plain. Y. G. I with this Gun have kill'd a monstrous Wren. Man. He come! Hang him coward. Y. G. Oh that he durst, then would I. What noise is that? Man. Nothing. Y. G. I thirst for blood, if there be any here. Aur. To drink, would he have it? Y. G. That dare according to antient books, maintain the beauty of his Lady against mine. Since the enemy dare not appear, I must be in action. Age. Where's yours? (Flourish) Y. G. My squire here shal be she, my valour shal supply that which wants in beauty. Duk. None dares. I am weary of this fool. Y. G. Dare none encounter me, march quite away? He's come, but 'tis too late, I scorn to stay. Duk. What did you come for? Y. G. I will tell you the secret, I did come hitherto no end, And I do mean to depart to as little purpose. Therefore like other Knights, that make a show In glittering Armour, as I came I go. Exeunt Gudgen &amp; his Man. Phil. Call him back again, hee's a rank coward. Duk. No, let him alone, I'me weary; besides the day is far spent, And we do lose much better sport; nor were it well To have him so discouraged. Aur. Pray, Sir, let me enjoy your friend Gudgen's company sometimes. 1. C. Madam, I'le fit him the best I can to make you sport. Aur. If Philanthus conceal from Agenor What I enjoyn'd, he loves me more then him, Which I shall much rejoyce in. Age. Is this your friendship? Exeunt, manet Phil. &amp; Age. Phil. Do not accuse me, where I am not guilty. The secret is not mine, that's trusted by another to me: And when it does concern them more then me, Yet so much I am touched, that I do burst With a desire to tell you. Age. Why do you not? Phil. She bound me by an oath to the contrary, most cunningly; For else, she knew I would have told it, you. Age. Philanthus, I see she hath wholly won you from me, And I am glad you need not use my friendship further. Which of you two to accuse of most unkindnesse, I know not well. For me, I should not have entertain'd The knowledge of a secret, on a condition so prejudiciall To our friendship. Phil. 'Twere great injustice in you, if't should. A perjur'd man would ill become your friendship. Age. You tell it to no man in telling me. Phil. Had not her tongue, her action did enjoyn me to keep it from your Knowledge of all men; you saw, she did desire your absence. Age. Perhaps she fear'd to speak before me, that which yet she would Be well content, that I should know from you. Phil. If I have friendship, the knowledge of it, if you love me, Would more afflict you, than my denyalls does. Age. Such an excuse does worst of all: farewell. Phil. Sure Aurelia so much hates me, that she envies me That happinesse of her brothers friendship, and onely Did invent this plot to break it. Stay, Sir, I'le give you proof That I dare trust you with a secret, and you will Say, a strange one though not this. Age. Well, what is't? Phil. I do not love your sister. Age. How! Phil. No otherwise then as she is your sister. Age. This makes me more suspect your friendship. Phil. Why should you think I love her, since she hates me, And laies plots to deprive me of your friendship, Which, by the gods, I prise above what happinesse Women can bring me. Age. This protestation makes me think, you do not love indeed. Phil. Be not mistaken, I do love. Age. Whom? Phil. Remember my past fortune with the beautious Lady Of the Castle, and you will finde, that I have cause To be a Lover, if only out of gratitude. Your sister's cruelty hath made my reason Once more Master of my will; and being so, I cannot chuse, but see my former folly, In hoping to enjoy so absolute a creature As Aurelia is, whom heaven ordaines For one of greater merits; the gods had been Indeed unjust, to make unworthy me the centre, Where so much worthy loves should meet, the least Of which, is sure to make the best deserver happy. Age. Philanthus, my friendship's of that nature, that it does Glew me unto your designes; and since I see My sister hath given over to deserve your love, I must confesse, I think you could not place it with more reason, Than on this Lady. 'Tis true, that I would have thee still a Lover Like my selfe, for so you'l hear me, and not laugh, When I deplore my misery in love; and I do glory, To be found more constene than you are. The scorns Of my Mistresse have not altered me; I think It vice to change, how ere she uses me. Phil. Rather 'tis vice not to change, when reason does command it. Age. Reason can never be your warrant to be false. I had been false to reason and my selfe both, To love where I should finde neglect yet, Where I love, 'tis with much passion, but Not your blind-fold constant way. Age. Nor would I that you should. I shall be happy In your happinesse, or you in mine, if either Of our different waies do prosper. But you Now love you know not whom, nor know you where to finde her. Phil. Pardon me, the skilfull Moor, late come to Court, Assures me, that he will let me see again That Lady by his art. Age. When this? Phil. This morning I sent my man before to tell him, I am comming; his house is here hard by. Age. May I not see her too? Phil. Perhaps, if you disguise you like my servant. Age. I will. Phil. Let's go then, I know he does expect me. Exit. Enter Moor, and a Servant. Serv. Sir, my Master will streight be here. Moor. Sir, I am ready. Enter Philanthus and Agenor. Phil. Great Master of your art, good-morrow. Moor. Good-morrow, noble Sir. Phil. I hardly yet believe it possible, You should perform what you have undertaken. Moor. More, Sir, if I please: I am in substance What others seem; nor shall you stay The making of a Circle. But who's this with you? Phil. A servant, Sir, that I dare trust. Moor. Pardon me, Sir, I have reason to be wary. This art is no waies lawfull; for telling fortunes, That I count nothing. Is there nought else that you desire? Phil. Nothing. Moor. Stand by then. By that great power that's given me, Recorder. I charge thee, the form of that Lady, to Appear, that this Prince desires, so habited, As when he saw her last. Enter Lucinda. Phil. Oh ye powers, 'tis she. I must confesse, your art Is inimitable, 'tis the same form; me-thinks It looks so like the life, that it would speak, If I should question it: no beauty can be greater. Shee's gone, can you not once more shew her. Exit Luc: Moor. Yes, and much more, if I were pleas'd. Phil. What? Moor. What? sit down and you shall see. Return thou beauteous shadow. Enter Lucinda. Phil. She's by much fairer then Aurelia; I was a fool To pursue what's fled, and to refuse a blessing Offered like this; she smiles, as if she understood me, And confirm'd my saying. Age. Although I burst, I'le see the end. Phil. When first I saw what's here presented, I could not think she was the thing she seem'd, And now I cannot think she is a shadow, But a substance,—That sigh assures me, That shee's flesh and blood; and yet a Dæmon May possesse a body, making it move by its own Organs. A dead Body, not a living body: pardon, if shadow, Or if substance, this bold touch; it is not profane, Since it proceeds from an affection equall To what a mortall ere could boast of, in so short a time. This soft and warm hand does assure me, you are That noble Lady, to whose courtesie I owe My life, and now again it is within your power To see me die. But if you shall once more, make me a tender Of that love, which at your Castle I refus'd, As being then a prisoner to anothers beauty. Assure your selfe, I shall redeem that errour, With an affection equall to your merits, paying the debt Of two lives that I owe you, and this of love the greater. Age. Oh false friend. Phil. She answers not. I fear I all this while, transported By my passion, have spoken to a shadow. Luc. Rather I fear your protestations will prove such. Age. 'Tis she, and I am miserable. Phil. Oh my joy. No, Madam, they are as firm as are the Poles, Here the Gipsie pulls of his beard. That prop up heaven; and can I doubt? the proofs That you have given me of your love, are infinite, In that you thus disguise your selfe thus once more T'ingage me in an infinite affection, which I desire to seal thus. Luc. Will you not think you, recall your vowes, When you shall know my name Age. Cruell woman, thou needst not tell him, he too well knowes Thou art Lucinda; the unkind Mistresse of his Too kind, and much wronged friend Agenor. Phil. Lucinda, Oh my crosse fortune, I am false and knew it not. Age. Excuse it not, but justifie thy self, That I may kill thee without repining. Phil. You know I never saw saw her. Age. True. But was it possible thou couldst believe, That I could be transported with that passion For any other beauty, then for that thou seest in her? How often, ravished with admiration, did I describe All this while, after their swords are drawn, the Gipsie and the Lady perswade and hold the Prince. Her face, and thought by love, like the must cunning Painter, To draw her very feature to thy understanding, As they do to the sight; so much at least, As if thou hadst but been that friend, Which I did hope, it would have prompted thee to fear No other but Lucinda could have been so fair. Phil. Y'are passionate without all reason, and Forget friendship. Hear me. Age. No, I am too tame, suffering thee, that hast Nothing, but the empty name of friendship, Thus to abuse me and shall that be a sufficient Bridle to hold back my revenge? Draw thy sword. Phil. Why, you are mad. Luc. I fear some ill event. Age. Why smile you? Think you, because my valour is not like to yours, The subject of each tongue, my maiden-sword, Never unsheathed till now, that I do fear In a just cause to use it? Provide your best defence. Phil. Defence, hear me. Age. Come, draw, and do not dally. Your guilt hath Made you weaker then you think, you are not What you were, when you were faithfull. Luc. If I have any power, let me conjure you. Age. You have none. Luc. Hear me.—How do you noble Sir: Oh for a Chirurgeon Here, she breaks from the Gipsie. Age. Ha! what have I done? Phil. 'Tis in vain, I am well, well as I could have wish'd I am remov'd from being a hinderance to My friend in his affection. You perceive How much he loves you, since it did force him To make a sacrifice of me, me, his better halfe. Sir, give me your hand; it was my fortune, not my will, That crost you in this Ladies love. And, Madam, Remember, that my last breath is employ'd, To assure you, that I shall never rest In peace, if any other shall possesse that place, Which you thought me worthy to hold, in your affection, Then this Prince, who onely does deserve it; To whom, I hope, my weak defence, may justifie my innocence. Luc. Thou cruell murtherer of thy friend, who rather than Endanger thee, would not defend himselfe. Thou cruell Butcher. Age. I fear I have been too rash. He no way did employ his sword. Luc. Oh cruell fate. Gon, he's gone for ever. Age. He's quite dead, and you are hurt too, I think. Ha! Luc. A scratch. Age. He did employ his last breath to gain my love, From you too; did he not? Luc. He did, but 'tis in vain, for I shall hate thee more then a Serpent. Age. Yet lesse then I shall do my cursed selfe, The vildest monster of ingratitude, That the earth ever bore: I wonder why It does not gape, and swallow me alive. 'Tis mockery to believe the gods are just, After this sufferance: Here, if you have any mercy, kill me. Luc. Not I. Age. I'le do't my selfe then. Moor. Hold, Sir, for heavens sake. Age. Thou ignorant, 'twas to please heaven I would have done it. Moor. You are deceived, they want not proper instruments; If 'twere their divine pleasure to shed your blood, To shew their justice: No they delight in mercy more. Age. But not so far as to confound their justice, I am no subject for it. Moor. Madam, your help, to save another mischief. Luc. Onely that thought makes you unfit, y'are penitent already; And that I may remove from you this black despair, That darkens thus your understanding, know, For your friends dear sake, if e're I love again, It shall be you, except his memory. Age. Fain I would die, yet fain I would believe her. Oh love! what power thou hast, that thus can change My just revenge; although I know this protestation Growes from a fear to offend his ghost, and not From love to me, for that's impossible: Yet, I will live, to inflict such punishment Upon my selfe, that you shall give me leave to die, To end my misery. The Tombe I will erect For this dear Coarse, shall well expresse my love, Howe're, my unfortunate hand did shed his blood. Let your care be bestowed upon the body, Till I dispose of it; I shall reward your pain. Moor. My Lord, I will. Age. Heaven affects. Why do I live, and see him thus, And I the Author? Madam, what is your pleasure? Will you remove unknown, or shall I wait Upon you to your brother? Luc. Sir, I beseech you, give me leave to be my own disposer. Age. Obedience is my sacrifice. Luc. But how, or where, is yet unknown to me, Uncertain fate, yet certain misery. Exeunt. Finis Actûs quarti.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quintus. Enter the two Courtiers. 2. What, are our Comedians ready? 1. Yes, yes. 1. That's well; the Princesse does walk presently, and comming in unlook'd for, 't will please her the better. It's fine Poetry, is't not? 1. Onely faulty, if not foolish enough; a quarter of an houres work, when 'twas done; and yet I have studied a long time; and can finde nothing more ridiculous, 2. Is there no prologue? 1. No, there's too few Actors.—Here's the Princesse. They have their cue, they'l enter sure. Enter Aurelia and Miranthe. Aur. How now, what strange hob-goblin's this? Enter Man. Man. Love, that intoxicates the brains of mortals, where there is any, Here inhabits none to be intoxicated, 'tis well known. Not Sisiphus, that restlesse rowles the stone still, Takes more delight, then I do in my own fill. Enter Gudgen like a Lady. My Phillida, lo where she does appear, More humble then a Peacock, or his peer, The Turky, who with her bristling plumes, Confounds my sense, and my poor heart consumes. Oh gods. Oh most glittering Wight, Thou workst upon me, I had need go write. My passion, 'tis not a stumbling tongue, That can expresse the love I bear thy bung. Y. G. Kisse where thou lov'st, I thee pray, even here; Nothing I have too pretious for my dear. But you do fool me, I and frump me; you, I Venus fair or chast; go too, go too. Man. Is Venus like to thee, thou durty sow? No, thou art like unto our brended Cow: But yet I fear she will prove wilder far, Thou art incenst, thy goblin eyes make war. Y. G. Puh let me go, these come not from your heart; Too late I finde you play the Courtiers part. Man. May all the joyes of earth confound me, I, Have dyed thy love, and live I will perdy. Y. G. Oh perjur'd man, see where she comes you wot of, Betwixt you surely I am made a sot of. Enter a Wench. Wen. Sir, I am come to visit you, and your fair Mistress. Man. Most odoriferous Lady, you are offensibly welcome; for you have done me a most desperate and intolerable favour; my Mistresse does with me, I know, congratulate the mischiefe. Wench. Sir, I am a simple wench, that understand nothing beyond sense. Man. I am sorry for it, yet I will descend to your understanding, and speak none; or very little, hereafter. Wen. It will become your person. Y. G. Hark how she woes my dear: Oh, I am lost I fear. Wen. Lady, you are sad, and much I wonder, being so happy in your servant. Y. G. Damosell, you are unkinde, your scorns are scurvy, and become you not. Man. Oh thou art such a pretty wench, I could wish my selfe a gib Cat, and we two together in the dark. Y. G. Ah me! he's lost. Sir, you forget me, your Phillida. Man. Thee? I do contemn the thought of such a dowdie. Y. G. Ah me, then let me die; thou constant wretch, maist thou sink down to blisse; but shall I curse, whom I have loved more, then my best Cow Mull: Oh no. Come death and end my woe. But what shall finish my unhappy daies? this knife, this shall afford me passage to the shades below, where I will try by dying thus my love to show, and fill his hard heartfull of dismall wo. Man. Alas good fool. Wen. Will you not save her? Y. G. Now I am dead, dost thou not grieve, thou cruell elfe, If I had known, I had not kill'd my selfe. Now I am stark dead, pray tell him so. Man. Would thou wert buried, thou'lt ne're leave talking else. Aur. Miranthe, this is so wofull a story, I'le hear no more, make my excuse to the dead Lady, when she revives. Exeunt Aur. and Miran. Man. Master, Master, rise, rise. Y. G. That's not my cue, he's out. Man. The Princesse is gone. Y. G. Gone is not my cue neither. Man. The play is done. Y. G. Thou lyest, I must be kis'd first; I wil I not open mine eyes till I be kis'd. Man. What a coile's here, I could finde in my heart, now his eyes are shut, to undo my points, and give him his cue. Sir, Master. I think hee's a verier asse then my selfe, there let him lie, for me, I'le follow for a reward. Exit. Y. G. Is he gone, had I no place about me worthy his kisse? Then let me wake from death. Why this it is, Since when I courted him, he would not come, My Ghost shall haunt him, till he kisse my hum, hum. Exit. Enter Aurelia and Miranthe. Aur. This is the day, and this the place, that Philanthus Intends to present himself as the stranger Knight, To receive what punishment I shall inflict, Where I will make him jealous of himselfe. Mir. Why will you so torment him, since you confesse you love him. Aur. Still to draw greater proofes of his affection, in which I glory. Mir. Take heed, whilst that you use him thus, you do not Lessen what you would make greater, his love. Were I man and in his place, I should have hated You, for you in reason have appeared unworthy, And inconstant, which how his generous spirit May brook, who knowes. Aur. Púh these are needlesse fears, see where he comes, The same armes he wore, when he o'recame Adrastus; A coldnesse strikes my heart at fight of him. Enter the Moor as Philanthus. Moor. If you be the Princesse Aurelia, I was enjoyn'd Thus low to bend my knee, lower my heart, In my submission to your offended deity. Aur. Yes, Sir, I am, and you I take to be the most Discourteous Knight alive. Moor. Madam, I have already paid for that offence, The forfeit of my honour, if not to be recovered, By faithfully performing what I was enjoyn'd, Rather commanded, by your Philanthus, for such How e're you prise him, he desires to be esteem'd. Aur. How well he counterfeits anothers voice. Moor. By a strange accident he met me, and when Perswasion would not move me, for I had a desire Another way, he did employ his not to be resisted valour, Compelling me to swear, for safeguard of my life, Here to present my selfe, and willingly receive What punishment your rigour can inflict. Aur. What censure do you expect? Moor. Death, for I do believe you the most cruell Lady living. Aur. Why do you think so? Moor. Your rigour to Philanthus, who partly mad: Me know his story, made me suspect; yet still He loves you, more then his own soul. But your Unjust hatred against me, gives me assurance, Of your cruell nature. Aur. Perhaps I did but seem to hate you, you see I am unarm'd For punishment, none but my selfe, and one weak woman more. But you are bound by oath to endure what ere I shall inflict; I'le try him fully. Moor. I am, and wish to know my sentence. Aur. With your own sword I will perform it. Moor. Alas, you have not strength to take my life, were I unarm'd. Aur. Rather no will, you are not noble that would thus, T'the danger of your life, perform your promise. Receive your sword, and know, I am so far From hate, that I did love you, for the great respect You shew'd me, though I seem'd otherwise. But you retiring, and to me unknown, Bar'd me from means to thank you, or let you know, How much I lik'd your valour, which sure by Philanthus Could not be exceeded; I rather take it as a courteous act From you to him, he hoping the performance Of the task enjoyn'd, might reconcile him to my love, Which is now impossible; yet, I did much affect him, Till his boasting did beget my hatred. But trust me, in his sending you, how e're, I thank him he hath much prejudic'd himselfe. There is no honour that this Court can do you, Which boldly you may not promise to your selfe. Nor would I have you think I am unconstant, For I have still profest to love, where I did find Most worth, untill I were confin'd by Marriage. Moor. Madam, however some will censure this your humour, To me it does appear the best. I honour you, And shall believe my selfe the happiest creature Living, in this your good opinion. Aur. Longer, Sir, I will not hold you, but when you please To visit me at Court, theres no assurance Of my affection, that I shall refuse. Which honour will permit me to bestow. Moor. I, make me in my own opinion the mark of envy, To the most happy living. Besides, thus on your hand, I seal my lasting service. Exit. Mir. Madam, what's your designe in this, to give Philanthus, As a stranger, so large assurances of your affection, And yet make him think, you hate him as he is himself. Enter the second Courtiers. 2. Ah! Madam, the most unfortunate accident. Aur. How! what? thou frightest me, speak. 2. The Prince your brother. Aur. What of him? 2. Hath kill'd his dearest friend, noble Philanthus. Aur. 'Tis impossible, I know the contrary. 2. Oh, Madam, 'tis too true, your brothers sorrow is a witnesse of it; The Court is drown'd in tears, and justly, It never felt a greater losse. Aur. I have abused my self then, made vowes and protestations To I know not whom; the voice indeed was different. But is this certain truth? were ye a witnesse? But how, or why, or when? I am amazed With wonder and sorrow. Speak. 2. 'Tis so certain, that your brother would have kil'd himself, Had he not been prevented. Aur. He had done well, 'tis fit we all should die; For who would live after Philanthus. Exeunt. Enter Lucinda. Luc. You Gods, was't not sufficient misery for me To love a man, whom I had never seen before? His heart given to another, or ere he knew me? But that you afterwards must raise me to the happiness Of his affection, and then thus violently pull Him from me. Why should you thus oppose your strongest powers Against a silly woman. But, love, I know it is thy malice, That did invite the cruell destinies to cut The fine spun thread of dear Philanthus, and cruelly Lengthen mine. You powers, it is enough; for you have humbled My proud heart low as the earth. Seek out some other, That hath not felt your scourges, I confesse Your power, and am obedient too. But why should I Begin to flatter unjust heaven, within whose power It does not lie to pleasure me. Philanthus gone, Whose name I'le reverence more in their despight, Then all the envious deities, that took him from me. Enter Philanthus, as a Ghost. Phil. Impious, cruell, and forgetfull woman, thy sacrilegious Thoughts and words, I see, have been the causes, That have stopt my passage to the Elizium fields, Forcing me thus wandring to stay above the earth, To feel torments above neglect in love; Nay, equall to those hellish pangs, bred from the thoughts Of a much lov'd inconstant Mistress. But I'le revenge My selfe, by haunting thee perpetually. Aur. Oh thou dear ghost, such a revenge were sweet, I should desire to look upon thee ever. After I had thee, thou wert soon lost, I was not satisfied. Let me if possible embrace thee, at least Converse with thee for ever thus. Phil. I see you have forgot my last request. Think on the Prince, in whom I live; this way ye cross The ordinance of heaven, who never failes To punish disobedience, from me. If you Be slack in loving him, my ghost shall never rest In peace; and when I next appear, a thousand furies Will come along, and in your sight torment me, Past what a mortall can imagin, if not for love Of him, for love of me. Be pittifull, and free me From an endless misery. Go to my Tomb, Where daily you shall finde him weeping: There make an offer of your selfe, in recompence Of all his sufferings; this done, you may be happy. But if refus'd, the height of misery will fall upon you, To me, perpetuall torment; remember, On me perpetuall torment. Luc. Stay, stay, and hear me. Phil. My time is past, remember lasting torment. [Ex. Luc. 'Tis vanish'd, cruell ghost, that dost conjure me, Thus unkindly to forsake my first love, inconstancy's a vice, They do not love at all, that can love twice. 'Tis to me impossible, which if I do it not, I shall be miserable. And in doing it, I shall be so too then 'tis indifferent: Oh no, I shall release from misery, And happy make the ghost of Philanthus; That thought alone o'recomes me. (Recorders) Strange friendship when the ghost of him that's dead, Shall for the living with such reason's plead. Exit. Enter the two Courtiers. 1. Where is the Prince? is he yet so transported with sorrow? 2. I ne're saw man so torment himselfe. 'Tis true, Philanthus Deserv'd to have as many tears shed for him, As any Prince that liv'd, but yet, that being past, And sorrow fruitlesse, me-thinks the sorrow should grow lesse. 1. If it be possible, it does receive increase. Some say, the Princesse Aurelia bears a part too. 2. Wheres the old Duke? followed his children to the Tomb Of Philanthus: Never such a sorrow seen in Millain. 1. In duty we are bound to wait upon them, Both with our persons and our sorrow. Exeunt. Enter Agenor. Age. Me-thinks this sacred ground, that does contain The body of my friend should open it self, And give me leave once more to embrace him, If his dear ghost be 'concil'd; and if it hate me, Why should not then the earth, in friendship To its now inhabitants, gape wide and swallow me Alive, for my base act? How often have the gods Made even the insensible elements, the executioners Of their justice, against a murtherer, and a more Hatefull one was never performed: murder'd my friend, Oh base! and such a friend, that even in death Exprest himselfe above my malice. The wound This sword hath made in his noble &amp; undefenc'd breast Was only like a vent to a full vessell, That so the stream of his unequall love might finde The freeer passage. Why should I live then, to be the hatefull, And contemn'd example of ingratitude, to all posterity? And I will daily sacrifice my sorrowes and my tears Upon his Tombe, 'twill not serve. Were I a woman, Water might wash my guilt off; but as I am a man, A manly sacrifice must expiate my fault. Blood must be satisfied with blood. Philanthus, Receive this sacrifice, I will revenge the murder. Enter the two Courtiers. 1. Deer my Lord, what would ye do? Age. Nothing, why do ye hinder? Who made you my controulers? 2. Heaven forbid, that we should suffer you. Age. For friendship sake, give me my sword, why should you Keep me here to torment me? in death I should find ease. If any of you had a minde to die, and knew 'twould be for your content, Think you I would be so discourteous to disturb you? You need not hold me, you may give me freedom, Now I have no weapon, you cannot hinder me to weep These cursed eyes out; by whose false lights, false to my soul, came in that beauty of Lucinda, Whose violence working by jealousie, forced me To murder my dearest dearest friend. Pardon love, I have blasphem'd against thy deity, for which I know, His Ghost will hate me more then for his wounds. Enter Aurelia and Miranthe. Aur. Hence hypocrite, dost thou not fear his wounds Should ope themselves, and blead his searcloath At thy approach. Age. Sister, you cannot pronounce words half so harsh through, As I deserve, nor tax me with a guilt so great, But I'le acknowledge more, but not the same Which you accuse me of: For, were the sorrow Of the world joyn'd in one for Philanthus, Mine might be thought a worthy rivall, Nay, exceed that far. Aur. Oh Philanthus. Age. But sister, you, why you, why do you seem to grieve Thus, that in his life shewed such contempt? Aur. Oh brother, brother, seeking to deceive and blinde the world, I have ruin'd and undone my selfe, the heavens Are witnesses, that Philanthus to me was more Then father, you, and all the world. Then give me Leave alone to grieve, since all griefes else are but like drops to the vast Ocean. Age. Sister, the Ocean hath his bounds, though large, But my sorrow, like to his love, for whom I grieve, Must be beyond all limits, but his desert, The cause of my affliction. Aur. Philanthus, Philanthus. But what are words, or sighes, or tears, But weak expressions? let a dead silence rather show, They grieve not much, that can expresse their woe. Enter Duke. 1. Sir, your father. Age. Here, here. 1. Madam, the Duke. Aur. Lov'd Philanthus, I know he did, and so did I, Though I dissembled, dearly I loved him; if there be charity In you, open his tomb, that I may make his body know, By kissing his pale lips, that I did love him, More then he did me; his spirit's already Satisfied, I know, else it would haunt me. Enter Lucinda. Luc. You twins of sorrow, that strive with eagernesse, Which should be thought the truest mourner, make room For one, whose actions have in point of love, Outgone your airie words. Age. I know that voice, Lucinda. Luc. For which of you, after the killing of a much lov'd brother, For then I thought Adrastus dead, became Enamoured of his murderer, as I did of Philanthus? Or which of you forsook your honours, or your state, Becomming like to me, a stragling Gipsie, Forced to it, by a greater feeling of his merit, Than ever touched your heart, pursuing him In that disguise, even when to hope the least requitall Had been madnesse? and yet I must give proof Beyond all these, when I have offered some Few tears upon his Tombe. Aur. Lucinda, for such I know your name is, how would it vex me, To hear you boast your love thus of Philanthus, Were he alive; and yet I should have gloried much, To be by him preferred before so excellent a Lady As your selfe: But since unkind brother, But worse friend, hath by his rash hand, inrich'd The Tombe, with what we both should strive for, let joyne In sorrow, and from our mournfull eyes by turnes, Drop tears, till by continuall motion, this hard And unkinde Marble, may yield us passage to him, Which it now denies. And so at last we by our tears shall gain, What now by prayers we cannot obtain. Duk. My dear children, why do you yield to sorrow thus, Where there's no hope of remedy? I am a partner In your griefe; you know that Philanthus was as Dear to me as any; but since I know I cannot Raise him to life by weeping, why should I Shew my self a child, and mourn in vain? Enter Adrastus. Adr. How, my Sister here, and mourning o're the Tomb Of Philanthus, 'tis impossible, she never saw him. Age. You are deceived, Sir, be your own witnesse. Adr. 'Tis she. Degenerate from my blood, weep for mine Enemy. Save you, Lady. Luc. Brother, I know you wonder much to see me here; But more, that I lament thus for a man, Which you believe I knew not. Adr. I do, I see the great love that you profest to me, Was wholly counterfeit. Luc. Rather your vertues, brother, are not what I thought 'm: But love however's my excuse. Age. Oh Philanthus! Luc. Ha! me-thought the spirit of Philanthus spoke from his Tomb, Chiding my slackness in performing his will; did it not, Sir? Age. Not that I heard. Luc. His ghost appeared to me in dead of night, And cruelly commanded me thus to present my self Before his Tomb, a gift unto the Prince Agenor, From his dead friend. Age. How! do you mock me? Luc. Which, though unwillingly, I here perform, Much more to satisfie my promise to his ghost, Than to requite your love; and yet, noble Sorrow may be accounted merit. Age. Strange ghost! Adr. How? Age. Madam, till now, my thoughts were in the grave with Philanthus, His spirit it seemes, knowing my hearty sorrow and repentance Labour'd to make me happy in your love: And I receive you with a joy above What any tongue is able to expresse. Adr. This makes for my advantage, and is it possible, Aurelia may return to love me, Philanthus Being dead. Who's here, the Knight that fought with me? These Armes are ominous. Enter Philanthus and the Moor. Duk. Come from the Tomb, Agenor, leave this sorrow. Age. Sir, I'le obey you for this time; but after, daily offer up Tears of joy and sorrow, in which Scene I still Must be an actor. Duk. Aurelia, be not wilfull. Aur. Thus all forsake me, no companions in my sorrow left, And I do glory in it. Phil. Sir, by your gratious favour: Lady, why weep you thus? Aur. Ha! what are you so ignorant, that does not know the cause? Phil. Do you know me then, the large expression that You made me of your respects, I might say love, Made me believe, I should not be so soon forgot. Aur. Pardon me, Sir, I took you for this Knight then, for whom I now Weep, whose body lies here in this Tomb, from whence I do not mean to part; pray leave me, Sir. How got This Knight these Armes, they are the same Philanthus wore. Phil. Lady, you grieve for one, does not deserve this sorrow; Behold in me a worthier servant, who now am come to claim Performance of your so large promises. Point not to that, I beat him whilst he lived, and from him took these Armes. Age. Traitor Knight, thou liest; no, thou didst rather Play the thiefe, and steal them, which I will Make thee confesse, else offer thee a Sacrifice upon his Tombe. Phil. In these Armes I overcame Adrastus. Age. Thou liest, and shalt not live to injure thus The dead; know, 'twas Philanthus by all the gods, And this is. Phil. Philanthus, your servant. [discovers himself. Age. Ha! is't possible. Phil. Be not amazed, but trust your eyes. Age. How can this be? Phil. You being wilfull and enraged, I rather Ventured to receive one wound, and so seem slain, Than in your death to lose a friend, a Mistresse, And my own life too; but life would have bin hatefull After your loss, if I could have preserv'd it. Moor. But mark his love, while his wounds yet bled; (For to my charge, you know, you did commit The body) He studied to make you happy In my Ladie's love, which was effected, by playing His own ghost, whilst I did in his Armes, With you supply his place; how easie 'twas To cosen you, and those you sent, by filling The Coffin with some trash, having my brother To assist me in it, the dullest may conceive. For my part, I was glad to raise my Mistresse to a greater At least, if not a better fortune in The Princes love. Age. Madam, I hope you will not make his labour fruitless. Luc. It were in vain to cross the will of heaven, which seemes To have ordained Philanthus for your worthier sister. Phil. It lay not in my power till now, by reason of my wounds, To keep my promise truly; but now, behold Me ready to receive. Aur. Me, as a recompence for all your sufferings; no other punishment. Age. Sir, we are joyn'd, and do mean to grow together, If you do not severe us. Duk. Enjoy your wishes both. Adrastus, For your sisters sake I wish your friendship. Adr. Pardon the faults that grew from love to Aurelia, And I shall study your advancement. Luc. Brother, be better then you have been. Adr. Which to begin, I give my selfe again A servant to fair Miranthe, whose love, I know, Not malice, cross'd me in my love to Aurelia. Mir. I'le none, I thank you; You that forsook me, aiming at a greater Now offer'd I refuse, hoping a better. Enter old Gudgen and young Gudgen. Y. G. Old man, I say to thee, be proud, and eke rejoyce, to see thy hopefull son salute the Duke in triumph, and by him resaluted like to an Emperator. Duk. Away rididulous asse. Y. G. Did not I tell you? Duk. Get you into the Country to your sheep and oxen, those, you feed well, will like your company, here your Favouritship is growne stale; the Court is not so barren, but it brings forth daily some new humour, which at first is pleasant, but after, like to yours, grows tedious. O. G. Why, son, is this your gracing? Y. G. The envy of some Politick hath done this. Duk. See all things straight prepared to solemnize The happy marriages of these, in whom, Friendship and love strove for a name; Florish. In you love, in you friendship overcame. Exeunt. O. G. Come, son, come, after the loss of all our mony, let's e'ne go home, and be wiser once, never too old to learn. Y. G. I Father, but I am too young yet. Well, I will be a favourit for all this; I, so it shall be. Gentlemen, I mean to make a petition to the Duke, which I must intreat you to set your hand to, being the best judges of my ability; and thus it is: That since to be a worthy minion I'me not fit, Yet I may be the chiefe fool-Favourit.
