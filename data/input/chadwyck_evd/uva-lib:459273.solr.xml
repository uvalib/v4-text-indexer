Sceane 2a Trappola Biondello Tra. Iis not that my frend biondello Bion.

Biondello? my old coapesmate? of knaves ye grand captaiÂ«neÂ» not a knave of baser size, but a knave died in graine the warden of the company of iavells, &amp; the storehowse of suttelltie &amp; falshod, most wellcom art thou to vs. Bion. how goeth the world wt h thee? Tra. like a bowle very round Bion. Vpon an old razer wilt thou lend me xxt i e pound? and Ile paie thee againe when we ijo be honest men Tra. wilt do on thinge for me? shalt see what Ile saie then Bion. what is that?

Bion. that I cane Tra. Canst thou so? where is he? Bion. not far of Tra. yesternight he bade me be this mornyng at his loging, but wherefore I cannot tell thee Bion. then I can tell thee the astronomer thou must plaie to worke a certaine feate to serve his torne this daie Tra. he had haste when he mett me &amp; so told me not wherefore but he wild me to come to him &amp; then I shold know more Bion. I can tell thee the matter, for I devised it Tra. what is it? Bion. Go we in he will tell thee every whit Tra. he naie he slepes yet, if his old wont he kepe he wakes not so earlie Therefore while he dothe slepe declare me the circumst?nce Bion. Then harken Tra. I do so Bion. thou seeste that corner howse? Tra. Very well Bion. Ther old brancatio hath a passing pereles primrose to his dawghter who? formosus dothe love beyonde the moone? Tra. It is fitt to be amorous for on of his yeres Bion. now almost a yere agone wt h praiers &amp; presentes, &amp; bribes many a one that he gave to here nurse, he be haved him selfe so well that he gate to here bed howbeit the trewthe to tell she yelded not vnto him till first he had plighted his faithe &amp; trouthe vnto her, &amp; ther he her wedded &amp; bedded very closely, &amp; put the weddinge ringe on her finger, her father &amp; his ther of vnwittinge &amp; every boddie els, save her pore nurse a lone wher vp? commynge to her more times then that on he hath left his marke behind him, &amp; mad her a mother Tra. See what comes of gamynge Bion. whiche knowne, by a brother of her fathers he hath made a very earnest motion to his &amp; her father to have her: where vpon he wold mary her openlie againe wt h new solemnitie in the face of the world who? before he marred prively Tra. what saie they? Bion. Brancatius her father is content but my master Amedeus is so hellishely bent on the muck of this world, on his pelfe &amp; his drosse that of three thowsand crownes he wyll not bate a crosse of rownd redy payment in dowry to bringe wt h her Tra. O gredy gaping gourmound, O whinying drivelinge miser Bion. The damoysell hathe a stocke of towe hundred pound &amp; a ferme of her owne, but that soume cannot be found her stock &amp; her fathers cannot well reache so hie except he solde some land wc h he will not til he die &amp; then all is heres, for she is his only heire Tra. Treuly me thinkes her portion is faire Bion. yet it dothe not content our pinchefiste the old vecchio thoughe her fathers land be faire, &amp; he welthy allso he loves not longe barefote for dead menes showes to stand rather wold he one birde redy cawght in his hand then two in the bushe Tra. Ther in he hath some reason Bion. Ye &amp; see an other myschefe. in this same very season our neighbour Cantalupo old graybeard lovethe hottely my yo?ge masters wife Tra. what dothe he? in myne eye she is as mete for him, as a glove for a horses nose old morell wold have a new bridell I suppose. Bion. why fole? when he happnethe to sneese in the nighte hathe he not ned of on to saie Christe helpe Tra. thou readest right Bion. And furder she will kepe his back warme now he is old Tra. I doubt shee will make him stammer &amp; say I am a cucke-cucke cuckecold for old men speake hudell many times on that note but forthe wt h thy tale Bion. the old fole is so hote on that matche, that to stope my yonge master atide he tenderethe him his daughter, &amp; offreith to provide the three thousand Crownes that our vecchio dothe require wc h summe hathe so set my old master all on fier that formosus must hav her, the bargaine is concluded the writinges are ingrosed, &amp; yesterdaie weare they sealed Tra. and how then? Bion. how then fole? what shold formosus do but confesse he is maryd? for he cannot mary towo Tra. and what harme of that Bion. he shall lose his fathers love &amp; he torned owt of dores And therfore it dothe behove leste he lose his inherit?nnce to kepe all thinges secret now this same cantalupoes dawghters harte is set on an other on manutius. Tra. but I praie the what remedie have ye shaped for those matters? Bion. Theron the pointe dothe lie ffirst formosus wife dothe faine her selfe sycke &amp; kepes her chamber close, having gon a monthe quicke lest her father shold ?seave her bellie to swell in wc h case we ware forsed the hole matter to tell to her mother who to hide the thing mor cunninglie hathe devised as it were for the ease of her malady that she shall to the farme here wt h owt ye towns end to take ye freshe ayer to see yf she will mend Tra. Oh thies m?mes are exigent thier daughters prankes to hide Bion. how finelie for the purpose &amp; clarkly she dothe ?vide to salve her dawghtrs sore &amp; to bleare Brancatioes eye this daie aftar sopper she shall go thither closlye she hathe borowed a litter for the purpose. Tra. Thates alone. Bion. well, that feare is halfe past as sone as she is gone Tra. But to breake the second mariag, how provide you for it? I meane wt h Cantalupo? Bion. peace I am not so fare yett This same rosimunda (so formosus wife is named) hathe an vncle a stale batcheler, whom we have framed to offer to geve for his nieces preferment these three thousand crownes, &amp; farther is content to make her his child, so she marye wt formosus Tra. will he disburse this mony? Bion. No, that charge lies on vs for the iij thousand crownes to provid Tra. wher are they? Bion. In my olde m?sters cofer, &amp; here is a false key to helpe vs vnto them, her vncle onlye shall take vpon him he dothe give it to helpe his niece wt h all Tra. Old grandsire will myse it &amp; so smell owt the trayn Bion. for that we have a shifte: Tra. that wold I here faine Bion. we intend to bringe him in beleffe that Sprites did rob him Tra. what is his head so grosse that you thinke you can bob him Bion. why is it a thing vnpossyble or vnlikelie that sprites wil deall withe gold? they are nimble &amp; slie to convaie greater matters Tra. lett formosus be advised for doubt lest he pull an old howse vpon his head Bion. well, heare me owt, formosus gave out this other mornyng that the howse was full of sprites, &amp; that he hard a rumbling all the livelonge night, &amp; fained a mervelous feare Tra. what said old amedeus? Bion. he laughed at this geare &amp; cald his sonne fole, but at night went formosus to lie forthe of doors here at the next howse wt h our neighbor Camillus, from whence throughe a window wc h I left vnbolted they gate in by lowe &amp; so in to the cockelofte our my old masters head ther they shaked Iron chaynes, &amp; bounsed, &amp; trampled &amp; howled as a thowsand devels had bin there Tra.
