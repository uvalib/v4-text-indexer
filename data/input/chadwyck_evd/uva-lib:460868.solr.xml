      <field name="fulltext">TO ÃSCHYLUS. Across the gulfs of Time I cast The peering of mine hungering eyes To pierce the thick gloom of the past Where hides the all of all that dies; I lean into the ghost-filled night And my will pierces on to dreams Of shapes and shades that seem to sight Till one, thine own, so sought for! seems; Then is thought smit with wondering awe And hushed before thine ancient brow Ploughed with the furrows Athens saw Throning thee then as we do now. What hoards lie in the mounds of death To-day nor after time may bare! Where are the treasures of thy breath Save these great with thy greatnessâwhere! What Death has grasped can Time regive? Forgive me, mightiest, that I here Dare bid thy solemn chanted hymns relive, Dare call to thy gone gods to yet again appear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Zeus Man Prometheus The Fates Chorus of Oceanides</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mount Hymettusâbefore a cavern in the mountain-side. At the back of the stage Clotho, spinning, Lachesis, and Atropos. Chorus of Oceanides by the altar. CHORUS Shapes of shadows, who are ye, Dark-robed, mighty, mystic Three? THE FATES Daughters of primÃ¦val night, Dwellers deep in primal gloom, Ere Earth was, ere yet was light, We, the mystic Three, dealt doom. Chaos with unbreathing awe Saw the weirdly-working Three Shape to an unspoken law All, in earth or heaven to be. CLOTHO Lo, I whirl the mighty spindle; I the thread of being spin, All the life to grow, to dwindle, Life to laugh, to weep, to sin, Life to gleam with fleeting gladness, Life to dare to dream 'tis blest, Life to know the scourge of sadness, Know despair, man's hateful guest. LACHESIS We Ouranos' ancient might, We discrownÃ«d Kronos' throne Drew from forth the womb of night, Womb that bore for us alone. Awful Reigns, we span them sway, Realmless years, their empire past; Earth and Heaven our rule obey, Ours that Zeus's shall outlast. ATROPOS Yes, the Thunderer sits on high, Throned 'mid golden-sceptred Powers; At his nod, men live, men die, But his awful gifts are ours; Shall he, from his golden stool Hurled, with dungeoned Godheads, groan, Or shall One uphold his rule? That to us and One is known, Unto One and us alone. Chorus. STROPHE 1 Hark! heard we the boasts they uttered? Heard we their dark words aright? Was that Zeus's thunder muttered? Will his lightnings scathe and smite? Of the Earth-born Strengths, down-hurler, He, Prometheus-counselled, Throne O'er all Thrones, this distaff-whirler, This Three, will he spare alone? ANTISTROPHE 1 Who is this One these were bold of, These that boast dread Zeus their slave, He whom this their drear chant told of, He who Zeus's reign can save? Wilt not Thou, O Cloud-compeller, From their fraudful vauntings, wring This their secret? O All-queller, This to light, from darkness, bring. STROPHE 2 O holy Fear, be thou my guide Through wildering ways where doubt would fain mislead; Let not my soul, insensate, stray through pride, Or the false lures that steal from seeming wisdom heed; With thee, O trembling Reverence, have I trod Safely my bygone path with footsteps sure, Nor will I now dare Zeus's chastening nod And court his wrath, in trustless thoughts, secure. No; be it mine to give not hate but awe Unto high Zeus, for he can but be just, Mine to see right in all he wills as law, And crush rebelling doubt with perfect trust. ANTISTROPHE 2 Ah me! how madly Folly dares The warning voice of Caution to despise And judges listening Zeus, nor fears, nor cares Lest Vengeance smite him hellwards, with fierce eyes, So do the loud-tongued, reckless, rush on ill, Blind to the Furies gnashing in their road; Those marked to perish, thus Zeus maddens still, Them, the fell brood of hell, to sure destruction, goad; Who from itself shall save the frenzied soul That mocks at awe and scoffs when warned of doom? Him may no fear of Heaven's red bolts control, Nor of the lightnings that, the curst, consume. EPODE. See! the Furies, dogs of hell, Tartarus' detested brood, Strain upon the leash with yell, Gnashing fangs that grin for blood; AtÃª's hounds, I hear them growl, Snap and snort, with eyes that flare Flame, and, hark! ah, how they howl, Loosed, to spring and rend and tear! Woe, thrice woe, to him for whom These dark hunters nose the scent, These, that in their chase of doom, Only are with blood content; Useless is his shrieking cry; They no stay nor mercy know; All in vain he seeks to fly; Theirs the fangs shall drag him low. ZEUS Here from Olympus' cloud-girt courts I come, And in the quiet halls of heaven is peace And mirth and feasting, and the deep-bossed cups With nectar bubbling sun from Hebe's hands; Sweet after toil is rest, and rule is sweet Caught from the foul and blasting breaths of strife, The ten years' clash and clang of brazen arms, With mountains hurtling through the fleeing air, And earth-fires blazing upward at the Gods, And Ocean's waves stilled with an awe of fright; Peace is with restful ease, and hung-up arms, Soundless, and thirstless spears, unhungering swords, And, for the roar of Ares and heaven's bolts Flaming innumerous, thunder-tongued, death-edged, Are low soft laughs that tell of secret loves, Ambrosial, sweeter that their bliss is hid, And Mirths laughed loud, and Dionusos' fires Fevering the cheek and surging through the blood, Loud-tongued and many-worded, with fierce joy. And the white brows of heaven, its fraudful eyes, Nets to snare hearts and capture them, love's sport, Are glorified by AphroditÃª's breath Who laughs, deep mocking with her dimpling boy, Eros, at all the mischief by them wrought, Seeing gods, bird-like, limed by looks and lids And tones and smiles and hardly murmuring sighs, And I, amid heaven's revels, lap my thoughts In languor and the easeful joy that knows In lowest Tartarus, beneath Earth, deep, Vast strengths, the Earth's most monstrous growths are hurled, Titanic-limbed, or breathe their howled-up fires 'Neath mountains, heaving upward, vainly fierce, Prone, brazen-chained, the mock of conquering Zeus. Yet steal there on my thought deep tones of dread Earth-muttered from this mountain, tones that tell Of unborn dangers in the onward hours That, sleeping, yet shall wake to time's soft tread; Who spake, unblest? who, boastful, chanting told Of perils unto me and kindred gods? Who vaunted of their rule and I their slave, And told in some dark time my rule should owe Existence unto One? Who is that One? Lo, in my inmost soul, there restless sleeps A dream of strange unrest and shapeless fear; Who cried unto it in my soul's still deeps And, crying, made it unto waking near? Ever it murmurs in my thought of One; Is that One of the Immortals bound or free, Or of the sad and woe-scourged race of men, Mortals, to beasts anear, brutish in lusts, Yet with chained powers that, freed, to bind were hard; Yet who will train them, as an athlete trains For course or wrestle in the courts of Zeus? Yet do I fear this danger, whispered-of, Lurks in the angry future of this earth, Should One turn traitor to my heavenly reign And wake to God-like life men's slumbering souls; Then were these mortals Gods in hopes and minds And powers and knowledge both of good and ill, And fears that awe them now were then their mock And we perchance were sacrificeless, starved Of prayers and songs beseeching, baseless dreads That cast them to the dust before our ways And make them shake before us in blind stones And trees, and the brute beasts and wandering winds And sunbeams and the rivers, founts and brooks And all things that, unknowing aught, they feel A mystery and a marvel. In this dread Were it not well to slay them from my earth By PhÅbus' arrows, Artemis' white shafts, Or dread Poseidon's loud floods, whelming all, Or plagues of monstrous boar and dragon scaled, Lion more huge than ramps in sultry sands Or hydra, hundred-headed, or some beast Born of the ooze and slime of the salt shore, Unsparing, of the hard and angry sea; Shall this not be and all my fear be slain? Forethought is safety; they who rule must arm Their fears with foresight and thus danger scare Or slay down-beaten. So Prometheus, he Who with fore-vision strengthened all my strength Till in the strife with Gods, I God-like smote And crushed exultant and exultant hurled To Tartarus or Earth's dark depths and reigned, Him will I seek and sharpen all my thought On his, and know if all of Earth I slay And whether thus I 'scape the peril hid. Chorus. STROPHE 1 Chaos was; his the empire ere Time was or Light, The fleet-footed Hours, the joy-flooding Sun, The glory of Day's shine, the white lights of Night, Ere Earth was, ere Ocean, while Heaven there was none, With Eternity dwelt he, nor knew he the birth Of his being or rule over void brooding gloom; With Night and thick Darkness dwelt he ere was Mirth Or Anguish or Sound until Time came and doom. Then to Night, his dark daughter, by Gloom, from him sprung, Were Ãther's vast void and the Joy-giver born, Day, ocean of soft light, whose billows among Rose the round laughing Earth to know Eve and fresh Morn; To her grassy bosom did mighty ones cling, The Mountains, her children, and Heaven bent o'er Her beauty and round her his vast arms would fling, And to him, the Terrors, the Titans she bore. ANTISTROPHE 1 Heaven gazed on his offspring and feared them, the strong, The monstrous, the curbless, the fiery Earth powers: In Earth's womb deep-dungeoned, they raged groaning long, Till Time leapt to light and grasped rule with the Hours; And Heaven resigned to his youngest his sway, And Kronos kept watch on his brethren's wild might, That evermore paled with their fierce roar the day And flushed with their fire-breaths the starred gloom of Night; Then of foam of the blue sea that fairness was born Beyond fairness, the mother of smiles and wild tears, April hopes, hot desires, wan despairs smit by scorn, AphroditÃª the subtle, the rose of the years; Of the soft wool-white tread of the queen of all wiles, The violet, the sweet thyme, the amaranth came, And she laughed to the Gods and the Earth, and beguiles Immortals she flushes with fever and flame. STROPHE 2 And Ocean had offspring innumerous, the waves, Leapers, playful in sunshine, that rage to the breath Of the roar of the winds and the storms, and sea-caves Saw us the white nymphs laugh to life free from death, And one, Heaven's white daughter, the just, oh, how fair! The light-dealing Themis, Iapetos wed, And to him did the well-loved a mighty one bear, Prometheus, by whom the far future is read. Then the Great Gods, the Bright Ones, were born unto Time, By Earth, the all-fruitful, and Zeus, God of Gods, In hand-force and brain-might, all matchless, sublime, Whose awful brow blessing or woe to man nods. ANTISTROPHE 2 And Time, who had rule from his ancient Sire torn, Feared AtÃª should make that he dealt out, his own, Devouring his offspring, the young to him born, Till, for Zeus, Earth's dark guile fed his fierce maw with stone, And his Sire's doom was his; from Olympus were hurled The forked bolts of Zeus and, in thunders, his shout; With him Strength and Force paled with horror the world, On his foes, Empire and Victory heaped ruin and rout. But yet the fierce Titans' wild might had raged still, Fell, horrible, endless, had not Forethought given To him Rule and Conquest. Boast Zeus as he will, To Prometheus he owes calm and throned hours in heaven, Oh, wise are the sage who, cool-brained, grasp success! Oh, where sits the throned not a tyrant in hate! Will the High One of Heaven his throner caress, Or senseless, ungrateful, make misery his fate? MAN, prostrate on the earth Oh, Sun-God, pierce me not with serpent stings! Lo, in the dust, I grovel and beseech Thy mercy! Thou, O Frost-God of the night, Fix not thy fangs upon this shrinking flesh And wake me howling! and thou, Hunger-God, Gnaw me not in thine anger! I will leap On the fleet deer and rend it limb from limb To glut thee, or, if it, through fleetness, 'scape, To satisfy thy cries, the shaggy strength Of the huge bear I'll grapple, claw to claw And tooth to tooth fierce rending. O ye Powers, Ye that with racking aches torment me sore, See how I crouch to you and grip the earth Prostrate with wondering worship, I your slave. O ye who made me, I am all your own To torment, well I know, for your fierce joy, For ye enjoy my groans or ye would stay Your tortures. Hear! if cruel pains and cries Of woe rise to you grateful, I will seize Out of my brethren, one to glad your ears And eyes with death-throes slowly dealt, that ye May have full gladness, and the scent of blood Slowly out-dripped from agonising veins May fill your pleasured nostrils through red hours; Can I do more to make my cries avail That ye would spare me? I asked not to live; Ye gave me breath and being. Why? that I Might fill your days with mirth at these my pains, Yet mixed with gladness, for I too am glad Feeling me strong of arm and fleet of foot And hard of heart what time I dare to face The charging boar and brain him with rent tree, Or with whole rocks uplifted yelling rush Upon the gnashing wolf and tawny strength Of thick-maned lions, monsters with the roar Of fork-flashed scaring thunders; when I fill My mouth with sweetness of new-hunted flesh From beast or quivering limb of my own kind Slain by my hand, then share I of your joy, Ye whom death gladdens. When I lap red blood Or, thirsting, fountain wave or brook drink in, Then is mine gladness. Yet know I a joy More like to yours, in the fell joy of fight, Of bloody conflict, whose dread end is death. Dear 'tis to me to bask in forest shade When, Sun-God, thou art highest, high above, And dear when, Frost-God, thou dost cease to gnaw Through dark and light and only bit'st in dews Of night and dost not chain the running streams, And come mild warmth and blossoms. Dear are too The berries of the woods the branches stretch Forth to my hunger and the luscious gifts Of purpled bunches of the sun-filled vine; These do I utter thanks for, Fearful Ones, And thoughts I think that hate and curse you when My days are torments; these I utter not, Knowing how cruel is your bitter wrath In life and, it may be, beyond, in death; If I beseech you not with yells and cries Enough and bleeding sacrifice and groans Sufficient, make me, Fierce Ones, know your will And I will hear your bidding and obey, Even if to gash my flesh and make my blood And moans a pleasure to you, be your joy. Or, if ye will not spare me, let still death Blind my clear eyes, nor let me wake again, Since I may wake into some world as drear, If ye be tyrants of more lives than this, But if death's slumber know no unclosed gaze, For ever let me be where are no dreams And rest to dust and know not of you more. Chorus. STROPHE How fleeting are these mortal lives! From night to night they shoot as flies a star Loosed from its place and not a trace survives When death has slain these things that scarcely are; How like are they to cloud-shades racing Over sunned and shadowed plains, Which swift winds and beams are chasing, Here and fled, and nought remains, And yet, ah me! how is this little span Of mortal breathing, this short dream of years, Filled with vain hopes and childish fears of man And baseless blisses and unnumbered tears. ANTISTROPHE Lo, naked from the womb he springs, To shiver in Earth's freezing air; No clothing plumes, no furs he brings, But instant needs another's care; Nor owns he fangs with which to slay, Nor beak nor claws that clutch and rend; With borrowed arms he smites his prey, Arms that the crags and forests lend. Does beast or bird at self-made shadows shake, At aught of unseen terror that but seems? No, men alone from their vain terrors make Spectres to shake at, shaped of dreads and dreams. THE FATES Ah, ye see but with your eyes, See Man but starting his great race to run; Our sight on through the lustrous future flies, On to the goal of times but now begun, And, oh, what vision meets our prophet gaze, As, with the growth of ages, our clear eyes See Man grown God-like with the coming days, Less than a God alone since still he dies. Lo, power is his that, from his fruitful brain, Leaps armed to conquer all things and to break All nature and her powers to bear his reign, The slaves of him whose throne they may not shake. Earth yields him tribute of her oil and corn, Her forests, toiling iron, marble, gold; Her steeds, her lowing kine for him are born, And the fleeced bleaters of the field and fold; And the innumerous billows are his slaves That bear his burdens and his terrors waft, His smiting arms that scourge his subject waves With oars that make them bondsmen to his craft; His are war's horrors; his its floods of steel, The charging phalanx and the shouting field, The patriot hearts that for their country feel 'Tis sweet to fall its name from shame to shield. His are the shouted victories of peace, Olympian glories through the wide earth rung, His the winged words whose flight shall never cease And thunders from the tongues of wisdom flung, His too the awful shapes of the dread stage, Of Heroes, Gods and Virgins, Goddess-fair, Dark deeds that loose the Furies' righteous rage While circling choral song awes the charmed listening air; Yes, Man's shall be the fever and the bliss Of song that fires the blood more than fierce wine; The Gods shall crown his glories all with this, And with song's holy power the mortal make divine. And his clear eyes shall see with Wisdom's sight And know the true from false, the false from true, And he shall judge the Gods and worship sacred right And scorn the unjust Heaven he served when time was new. So, unto our seeing eyes, All the bright fated future rises clear, And the far is as the near, And, lo, Man runs the race and grasps the prize. But let the pictured vision fade; See, weak and blind, he treads this hour his path, And vengeful Zeus his way has rugged made, And One must suffer sore to arm him 'gainst Wrong's wrath. PROMETHEUS O thou Engendering One, that with thy flame Dost fill the womb of Earth with fruitfulness, Bright HyperiÃ´n, of the sons of Heaven Brightest, thou brother of my mighty sire, Thee do I call on! Unto thee I cry, For thou, O flashing Sun, didst with thy fire Inflame the dust whence primal mankind sprung And were, and thou hast seen the things men are. Will'st thou, O sun, such things thy births should be? Twofold man's nature. One the dull earth gave, The clay that clothes him and makes worm and beast Hail him as brother. From his form he knows The common lusts and brute desires of life, Hunger and thirst and the hot needs of love, And lawless will to glut his wrath with death Of his furred fellows of the caves and woods And of all feathered things that winnow air, Or bright-scaled lives that flash through ocean's ways, Or rivers hasting to the embracing seas, And rage of slaughter of his brethren, men, Thwarting his wish or owning aught he needs. Thou seest him, All-beholder, filled with awe Of all things, for thou know'st he wakes to life Wisdomless, knowing nought of what Earth bears, Moving or fixed, finding in all he sees And touches, marvels, as an infant shall When come the longed-for after days to be. So all is mystery to him, all is dread, Nor knows he, naked, how to fend the frosts Of winter from him or thy fiery gaze, Nor clothing has he save the bloody skins Torn from the beasts he rends, his fireless food, No dwelling builds he, housed in icy caves. No dreams has he nor thoughts above the brutes He springs on, hungering. Memory and hope As yet he knows not. Yet within him sleeps That other nature that thou didst bestow, The fire that shall be to him God-like soul And light for all things. Knowledge, wisdom, power, Strengths known to make the might of nature his And the Earth-powers his bondslaves, thy own fire The strengths of winds, of waters, and of seas, Earth's metals and her bosom's power to bear Or fruits or herbs or cornâall gladsome food, The forests' unhewn roofs his hands shall rear To home him or the hymns he gives his gods, All these shall serve him when his soul grasps life And his thoughts climb by usage, strength to strength, And he has knowledge of the times of stars And circling seasons, and of numbers hid Now from him, and of letters that shall fix All time as present and all knowledge sure, Not fleeting with the moment, dead at birth, But knowing life immortal and all time. Shall he not be, O Bright One, even as thou That flashest on all darkness and it flees, And all things lie unveiled of night and seen? Shall he not be as the high Godheads are, Gazing through all Time bears and parting good From evil, that to cling to, this to shun, And scaling heaven with hands of love and right And doing justice for its own clear sake, Or whether it brings to him gain or loss, Pleasure or grieving? Thou that bring'st the day And slay'st all sadness, Thou all-conquering Joy, Shalt through his lit soul flash the fevering life That from his lips shall leap in sweet-tongued songs And hymns rejoicing, dear to Gods and men. What though the Thunderer fear man thus a God Shall cease to dread his thunders and to crawl And grovel blind before his golden stool; Better is wise sweet awe than slavish dread. Let heaven with mercy and with tending love Bow down the thankful knees of those it rules And bid the future life of Earth be glad, Not sad with griefs unneeded and wild cries Of agonies that should be griefs to Gods; Yet be Zeus mild or ruthless, I change not; Pitying, I gift the coming days of man With clear-eyed knowledge that shall make him blest If he use wisely, righteously, my gifts; Let Zeus upon him all his thunders hurl And still afflict him, yet, amid his groans, He shall be even as I, rock to endure, With soul that to the hail of direst woes Is adamant, a crag pain's billows rave And break themselves against in tossing spume, But move not, so shall he, even while his brows Are thunder-scored, lift to injustice up A front that bows not and accusing eyes; And I, that on me take not woes of men But dreader, I, foreknowing this and all, Doubt not, but, calm, unswerving face the fate That fronts me, looking still to that far day When Zeus shall kneel to me, not I to him, And I shall, glad, drink in his eager breath Of humbleness and suing and will rule Right for myself and men, ere I relent, And bind him to reign justly, dealing love, Not mingled love and hate, to all that is. I go; now shall he well know what I dare. Zeus and Prometheus. ZEUS Thou that foreknowest, hast thou aught to tell? PROMETHEUS What can I tell thou knowest not, All-wise? ZEUS I that am wisdom, yet would know thy thought. PROMETHEUS Ask then thy question. Say, what wouldst thou know? ZEUS My father cast his father down from rule. PROMETHEUS And thou dethron'st him who thy father was. ZEUS What if one born of me aspire to reign? PROMETHEUS Thou hast thy thunders. Hast thou too thy fears? ZEUS Fore-fearing caution would prevent all dread. PROMETHEUS Thou fearest not? then why should caution be? ZEUS Guileful, I do command thee, say thy thought. PROMETHEUS What if I close my lips, what wilt thou do? ZEUS Have I not rule of thee as of all gods? PROMETHEUS Me, Justice rules and Fate that rules thy rule. ZEUS Am I not Justice? and shall I not rule? PROMETHEUS Ay, art thou Justice? then I sue to thee. ZEUS Give me the thing I ask from thee, then ask. PROMETHEUS Forethought trusts not, but takes before it gives. ZEUS Fraudful, I do distrust thee. Tell thy wish. PROMETHEUS Thou seest all things. Thou art Justice. Look. ZEUS I see all things that are. What should I mark? PROMETHEUS Thou, Just One, lookest thou on wrong or right? ZEUS That which is done is right, since that I do. PROMETHEUS And seest thou not Man that thou hast made? ZEUS Why should I note him, thing of dust and death? PROMETHEUS Is he but one of earth's unthinking breaths? ZEUS Is he not one of myriad shapes of life? PROMETHEUS Him, mat'st thou with thy meaner handiwork? ZEUS Is not my will, the eagle, fashioned well? PROMETHEUS Is Man the fellow of thy bolt of air? ZEUS Seest thou the speed I made, the flashing steed? PROMETHEUS Thy work is good, a wonder and an awe. ZEUS The lion roars, the snake coils from my thought. PROMETHEUS All these are of thee, yet these are not Man. ZEUS Each is a mystery to thee. Is Man more? PROMETHEUS Man is not of them. Hear'st thou not his prayers? ZEUS Were it not well, his senseless cries were stilled? PROMETHEUS Speech is thy gift. Surely thy gifts are good. ZEUS If right still rule them. Hast thou heard his words? PROMETHEUS I listened and I heard him basely crouch. ZEUS Should he that makes not awe the thing he's made? PROMETHEUS Made him? how made him? free or thy whipped slave? ZEUS Do not the immortals live for me, their lord? PROMETHEUS Know gods not joy upon the thrones of heaven? ZEUS And fear before me? and shall Man not fear? PROMETHEUS All fear is baseness. Shouldst thou rule through fear? ZEUS What! should Man think upon me and not dread? PROMETHEUS Is it for this thou dealest to him pain? ZEUS I give him gifts diverse, even as I will. PROMETHEUS Why givest thou to him the gifts he hates? ZEUS Shall I unveil my thought to thee and him? PROMETHEUS If it be fair, why should thy will be veiled? ZEUS Why should I not give, even as I give? PROMETHEUS Hark! hear'st thou not, O Zeus, those woeful cries? ZEUS I hear them, hearing all things. What are they? PROMETHEUS Thou sayest thou art just and giv'st thou woe? ZEUS Why not? Who shall declare my gifts are ill? PROMETHEUS I, that have pity for thy creature, Man. ZEUS All life takes all I give, nor holds it ill. PROMETHEUS Ah, Man can judge thee, weigh thee in his scales. ZEUS Blind is he. Wouldst thou make his eyes to see? PROMETHEUS Gifts would I give to him that thou giv'st not. ZEUS Fling not my thunders. Thou hast seen them smite. PROMETHEUS Ay, they smote wrong, now will they silence right? ZEUS Tell me the thing I ask. Speak not of this. PROMETHEUS What if my gifts give unto Man his might? ZEUS Dar'st thou to threat? Shall I have fear of Man? PROMETHEUS Rule justly; thou shalt have his ceaseless love. ZEUS Meddle not with him. Let him be as now. PROMETHEUS What I will make him, that I clear foresee. ZEUS Shall I not awe him always? tell me that. PROMETHEUS What will be will be; I will give him sight. ZEUS To sin with. Will he, smitten, bless thy care? PROMETHEUS Better he see and suffer than be blind. ZEUS Wise, wouldst thou make him curst, arraigning me? PROMETHEUS The tyrant only dreads his subjects' thought. ZEUS Dost thou conspire with him against my reign? PROMETHEUS I answer only this, I do no wrong. ZEUS Right can it be to do what I forbid? PROMETHEUS Yes, when thou dost forbid right to be done. ZEUS Thou shalt not make this thing of death my dread. PROMETHEUS What wilt thou do, thou that afflictest sore? ZEUS What if I slay him, dungeon him in death? PROMETHEUS I know what thou canst do, and all foresee. ZEUS Tell me, thou wilt not arm Man for my foe? PROMETHEUS What if I arm him but to bear thy wrongs? ZEUS I do forewarn thee, do not Zeus defy. PROMETHEUS Forethought forearms me. I foresee the worst. ZEUS And my dread judgments wilt thou, frenzied, dare? PROMETHEUS Who dares endure is free all ills to dare. ZEUS Dread are my torments. Thou wilt this repent. PROMETHEUS Right must I do, and thou must work thy will. PROMETHEUS Thus still 'tis willed that it shall be, That power unbridled shall be wrong, For aye in heaven and earth we see The tyrant never mild for long; Ingrate, insensate, unjust power With fumes of frenzy mads the brain And beckons on dread judgment's hour And cautioning wisdom warns in vain. CHORUS Do ye not dread of highest Zeus To utter breath of hateful scorn? Wise were it that your lips refuse To speak such utterance of them born. Woe unto all who, over-wise, Dare unto unchained rule to tell Truth's bitter words; still terror cries To such, âBe dumb, while yet 'tis well.â PROMETHEUS New is this Zeus's haughty sway, And drunk with pride he shakes the reins Of guidance that all things obey, Nor thinks that rule o'er him remains. Yet, at a whisper of the lips, See ye not how an unshaped dread Upon his boastful soul fear slips And scares him wrong's rough paths to tread. CHORUS Is he not Zeus, the god of gods, The awful ruler, throned o'er thrones, Who life and death to all things nods, Celestial bliss, Tartarean groans? Who shall prescribe his awful ways, Or who dare hold for wrong his will? Or deal he bliss or woe, but praise, But trembling praise should laud him still. PROMETHEUS So from weak things of heaven and earth Who fear his wrath, let worship rise; Slaves' cringing moves my scorn and mirth; Their fear wrung flatteries I despise; Let gods shake in his savage sight; Let men for woes give praise and prayer; My soul his torments cannot fright Though me I know he will not spare. CHORUS Yet to the depths of silence fly Our thoughts, nor utterance from them slips; Better we, in our praising, lie Than cry down tortures with mad lips; What if stern Zeus injustice deal And bitter make men's fleeting breath, Wise are they who their ruth conceal For these, the scourged from birth to death. PROMETHEUS Ye speak as those the seeming wise To justice false, to truth untrue; For Man, my soul his wrath defies Unmoved whate'er the Tyrant do; Foreknown art thou, O bitter path, The ingrate wills; thou shalt be trod; My gifts shall make, despite his wrath, Man strong through wisdom, like a God. Prometheus and Man. Man entering from the cavern. PROMETHEUS I cry to thee, O Man, from where from heaven's Bleak skies thou burrowest, from thy cave, come forth. MAN What new voice calls to me? O Mighty One, Hold thou thine hand, nor torture me, nor slay. For thou art Godlike, thou art not of men, My fellows; I will grovel to thee; I. PROMETHEUS Rise up. Why shouldst thou thus crouch to my feet? I am not Zeus, the God that gives thee life And all that drives thy cries up to his throne. MAN Yet let me clasp thy feet, thou God of good, For I do cease to dread thee; in thine eyes I see not hate but gentleness and looks That cheer, not smite me. Oh, I will obey Thy thrice-blest bidding. Canst thou make it sure Those other Torturing Ones their hands will stay? Art thou their ruler? Thou art vast of limb; Those arms are deadly should they crash out blows, Wounds, or dull death. Surely Zeus dreads thy strength! PROMETHEUS Listen! I am not mighty as this Zeus Who sends thee aches and cramps and all things sharp And bitter, saddening all the laughs he lends. MAN Oh, I did hope that thou couldst end this Zeus, As thou dost name him, he that racks me thus. Does he rack thee? Ah, but art thou his slave, That fraudful dost beguile me of hard words Of cutting truth, that me thou may'st betray To him, thy tyrant? Oh, sting not his wrath. Let my sharp words have gone, keen gusts, but winds That howled and are not. I will show thee fruit And where my grapes hang thickest. Thou shalt glut Thy rage of hunger with this fresh-rent flesh. I dare not threaten thee, for I were slain, Clenched in thy grip or bone-smashed by thy blows. Speak! say thou wilt not bear on high my hate. PROMETHEUS Thou babblest idly. I am here thy friend, Pitying this more than half-curst lot of thine, And I will give to thee all I can give, And that I hold not little. MAN What giv'st thou? PROMETHEUS Look on this hollow wand my hand has brought. MAN Is it a God? must I its presence fear? PROMETHEUS Heard'st thou not me? I said I am thy friend. MAN Ay, so thou said'st. Oh, mayst thou not be false! But this thy hollow wand, what holds it? PROMETHEUS Fire. MAN What's fire? a thing of life? Ah me, I see Its red bright tongue, forked as a serpent's, dart From its round mouth, and, ah! how sharp it stings! PROMETHEUS Yet it shall glad thee; touch it not, but bring Leaves, twigs, and smallest branches for its food. And thou must feed it always, nevermore Starved from thee; for I stole this, Zeus's flame From his own hearth and doomed me to his wrath, For this bright theft that here I bring to thee. MAN Ah, how it seizes on these fallen growths Of this rough mountain's forests! as it flares, How the twigs crackle in its fiery jaws! How will it serve me? PROMETHEUS It is foe to frosts, And winter, so we name the time of cold; Hold thy hands to it. Is its warmth not good? MAN Oh, I do bless thee, Mighty Stranger God, For this thy gift divine. Can it do more? PROMETHEUS Beast-like, till now, thou hast on raw flesh fed; Heap on more wood; that venison on it lay, New-slaughtered. Wait; thou shalt taste daintiest food, Fit for Olympus. See, how the red blood Roasts to rich brownness. Taste now this fire's feast. MAN Oh, I will worship thee! The luscious meat! PROMETHEUS And greater things than this thy fire shall do. Look! this is clay. See, how I show thy hands Fitly to shape it to a furnace thus, And this dull rock, so weighty! that I stuff Its maw with, see! all this I gird with fire, Beneath, around it, and, in channelled sand I now instruct thee to shape hollow moulds, And iron, molten by the fire, shall run And cool and harden in them into shapes Diverse as are their uses; these shall give A sword, a spear-point, to thy hand, sharp arms 'Gainst beast or foeman, this, an arrow's head, Shot from bent wood and sinew, death to deer, Flying, or hare fleet-footed, or fierce roar Springing to rend thee, and to soaring wings, And, from these matrices, these iron blades I lift, the spade's keen wedge and the sharp share That shall the earth's waves furrow as the keel Ploughs ocean's plains, and these shall give thee gain Of tilth and waving harvests, vintage feasts And the grey olive's fruitage, apples red With summer's sunsets and all growths of flowers In blossomed orchards and in gardens flushed. Wilt thou home with thee this well-toiling slave? MAN Hast thou more gifts? thou makest me a God In wisdom. Oh, Thou Blest One, hast thou more? PROMETHEUS And fire shall cast for thee the hewing axe. So shalt thou fling the tall pine and strong elm, And cleave them, plank-wise, and the dripping earth No more shall house thee, but, from thine own hands, Thou shalt build seemly homes where fire shall dwell With warmth and dryness with thee all thy days, While tempests round thy fortress, baffled, roar, And all the hosts of snows sift on thy roof Nor chill thee, nor the lash of driven rains Falls on thee. Wilt thou not laugh loud, so housed? MAN Again I bless thee, Blest One. Hast thou more? PROMETHEUS And this, thine axe, shall float thee on the waves Where the dread might of Oceanus reigns, And whence with answering choirs and sweet-voiced hymns, Glad flames of torches and the shout of Gods Forth from her virgin home, the green lit depths Of deepest waters, I my sea-born led, Blushing, my bridal-won Hesione, For the same timbers as shall lay thy roof Shall, so I'll show thee, rib thy galleys' lengths, Thy stately steeds thou rid'st across the foam, Gathering thee treasures from all lands and climes, Or smiting all the white-churned waves with war. MAN Shall I thus ride the waters, Mightiest One? PROMETHEUS Ay, and thy slaves, the winds, shall speed thee on With sails that thou from thread-spun flax shalt weave: For I will show thee how the spindle gives The twisted twine and how the shuttle flies Cross-wise and yields thee raiment from the loom. And I will teach thee how thy white-fleeced sheep Thy shears shall bare to give thee wealth of wool To warm thee, woven. Thou shalt tame the steed For thee, its rider, and the ox thy goad Shall quicken, ploughing up thy fruitful fields. MAN Can there be more for Man? Hast thou more gifts? PROMETHEUS See; I have taught thee all thy body's needs To satisfy with housing, robes and food. But know'st thou not, O Man, thou needest more And higher blessings? I will train thy thoughts To strength; thou shalt see with clear inner eyes All knowledge and all beauty, Earth's and Heaven's, And shalt be keen to part the voice of right From wildering wrong's, and, hearing, thou shalt cleave To right's clear teachings and be calmly just, Not serving Heaven with abjectness, but eyes That dare to clearly scan its secret ways And love its justice, and love that alone If Zeus be harsh and send thee unearned woe. MAN Me, holds he sinless that I take thy gifts? PROMETHEUS Care thou not for his thunders, armed with right. He gave thee thought, that thought thou shouldst dare use, Not blind or cripple, lest its use disturb His perfect peace. Be thy heart hard as mine To look down, with endurance, unjust wrath, For Right not even Zeus himself can kill. MAN Can I be Man, now changed as thus I am, Soul-free through knowledge, gifted with all power? PROMETHEUS Run thou the open course before thy feet And grasp its glories and its golden gains; All is for him who wills. Endure. Enjoy. MAN And thou, what seest thou in thy onward path? PROMETHEUS Hate that inflicts. Strength that, through right, endures And conquers Zeus with patience and with pride, Not empty boasting which but brings its fall, But pride in justice known and firmly done. What I have done, that I have, seeing, done, And thinking of thy gains shall ease my pains.</field>
