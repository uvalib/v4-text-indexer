      <field name="fulltext">KING JOHAN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Enter King John.] K. Johan To declare the powres and their force to enlarge The scriptur of God doth flow in most abowndaunce; And of sophysteres the cauteles to dyscharge, Bothe Peter and Pawle makyth plenteosse utterauns; How that all pepell shuld shew there trew alegyauns To ther lawfull kyng Christ Jesu dothe consent, Whych to the hygh powres was evere obedyent. To shew what I am I thynke yt convenyent: Johan, Kyng of Ynglond, the cronyclys doth me call. My granfather was an emperowre excelent, My fathere a kyng by successyon lyneall, A kyng my brother lyke as to hym ded fallâ Rychard Curdelyon they callyd hym in Fraunce, Whych had over enymyes most fortynable chaunce. By the wyll of God and his hygh ordynaunce, In Yerlond and Walys, in Angoye and Normandye, In Ynglond also, I have had the governaunce. I have worne the crown and wrowght vyctoryouslye, And now do purpose by practyse and by stodye To reforme the lawes and sett men in good order, That trew justyce may be had in every border. [Enter] Ynglond Vidua. Englande Than I trust yowre grace wyll waye a poore wedowes cause Ungodly usyd as ye shall know in short clause. K. Johan Yea, that I wyll swer, yf yt be trew and just. Englande Lyke as yt beryth trewth so lett yt be dyscust. K. Johan Than, gentyll wydowe, tell me what the mater ys. Englande Alas, yowre clargy hath done very sore amys In mysusyng me ageynst all ryght and justyce; And for my more greffe therto they other intyce. K. Johan Whom do they intyce for to do the injurye? Englande Soch as hath enterd by false hypocrysye, Moch worse frutes havyng than hathe the thornes unpleasaunt, For they are the trees that God dyd never plant, And, as Christ dothe saye, blynd leaders of the blynd. K. Johan Tell me whom thow menyst to satysfy my mynd. Englande Suche lubbers as hath dysgysed heades in ther hoodes, Whych in ydelnes do lyve by other menns goodes: Monkes, chanons, and nones in dyvers coloure and shappe, Bothe whyght, blacke and pyed. God send ther increase yll happe! K. Johan Lette me know thy name or I go ferther with the. Englande Ynglond, syr, Ynglond my name isâye may trust me. K. Johan I mervell ryght sore how thow commyst chaungyd thus. [Enter Sedition.] Sedicyon What, yow two alone? I wyll tell tales, by Jesus! And saye that I se yow fall here to bycherye. K. Johan Avoyd, lewde person, for thy wordes are ungodlye. Sedicyon I crye yow mercy, sur, I pray yow be not angrye. Be my fayth and trowth, I cam hyther to be merye. K. Johan Thow canst with thy myrth in no wysse dyscontent me So that thow powder yt with wysdom and honeste. Sedicyon I am no spycer: by the messe, ye may beleve me. K. Johan I speke of no spyce, but of cyvyle honeste. Sedicyon Ye spake of powder, by the Holy Trynyte! K. Johan Not as thow takyst yt, of a grosse capasyte, But as Saynt Pawle meanyth unto the Collessyans playne, âSo seasyne yowre speche that yt be with owt dysdayne.â Now, Ynglond, to the: go thow forth with thy tale And showe the cawse why thow lokyst so wan and pale. Englande I told yow be fore the faulte was in the clergye That I, a wedow, apere to yow so barelye. Sedicyon Ye are a Wylly Wat, and wander here full warelye. K. Johan Why in the clargye? Do me to understande. Englande For they take from me my cattell, howse and land, My wodes and pasturs with other commodyteys; Lyke as Christ ded saye to the wyckyd Pharyseys, âPore wydowys howsys ye grosse up by long prayers,â In syde cotys wandryng lyke most dysgysed players. Sedicyon They are well at ese that hath soch soth sayers. K. Johan They are thy chylderne; thow owghtest to say them good. Englande Nay, bastardes they are, unnaturall by the rood! Sens ther begynnyng they ware never good to me. The wyld bore of Romeâ God let hym never to theeâ Lyke pyggys they folow, in fantysyes, dreames and lyes, And ever are fed with his vyle cerymonyes. Sedicyon Nay, sumtyme they eate bothe flawnes and pygyn pyes. K. Johan By the bore of Rome I trow thow menyst the Pope. Englande I mene non other but hymâGod geve hym a rope! K. Johan And why dost thow thus compare hym to a swyne? Englande For that he and his to such bestlynes inclyne. They forsake Godes word whych is most puer and cleane, And unto the lawys of synfull men they leane. Lyke as the vyle swyne the most vyle metes dessyer, And hath gret plesure to walowe them selvys in myre, So hath this wyld bore, with his church unyversall, His sowe with hyr pygys and monstr[e]s bestyall, Dylyght in mennys draffe and covytus lucre all. Yea, aper de sylva the prophet dyd hym call. Sedicyon Hold yowre peace, ye whore, or ellys, by masse I trowe, I shall cawse the Pope to curse the as blacke as a crowe. K. Johan What arte thow, felow, that seme so braggyng bolde? Sedicyon I am Sedycyon, that with the Pope wyll hold So long as I have a hole with in my breche. Englande Commaund this felow to avoyd, I yow beseche, For dowghtles he hath don me great injury. K. Johan Avoyd, lewd felow, or thow shalt rewe yt truly. Sedicyon I wyll not awaye for that same wedred wytche; She shall rather kysse wher as it doth not ytche. Quodcumque ligaveris I trow wyll playe soch a parte That I shall abyde in Englond, magry yowre harte. Tushe, the Pope ableth me to subdewe bothe kyng and keyser. K. Johan Off that thow and I wyll common more at leyser. Englande Trwly of the devyll they are that do onythyng To the subdewyng of ony christen kyng. For be he good or bade he is of Godes apoyntyng: The good for the good, the badde ys for yll doyng. K. Johan Of that we shall talke here after: say forth thy mynd now And show me how thow art thus becum a wedowe. Englande Thes vyle popych swyne hath clene exyled my hosband. K. Johan Who ys thy husbond? Tel me, good gentyll Yngland. Englande For soth, God hym selfe, the spowse of every sort That seke hym in fayth to ther slowlys helth and confort. Sedicyon He ys scant honest that so many wyfes wyll have. K. Johan I saye hold yowre peace and stond asyde lyke a knave! Ys God exylyd owt of this regyon? Tell me. Englande Yea, that he is, ser: yt is much more pete. K. Johan How commyth yt to passe that he is thus abusyd? Englande Ye know he abydyth not where his word ys refusyd, For God is his word lyke as Seynt John dothe tell In the begynnyng of his moste blyssyd gospell. The Popys pyggys may not abyd this word to be hard, Nor knowyn of pepyll, or had in anye regard. Ther eyes are so sore they maye not abyd the lyght, And that bred so hard ther gald gummes may yt not byght. I, knowyng yowre grace to have here the governance By the gyft of God, do knowledge my allegeance, Desyeryng yowre grace to waye suche injuryes As I daylye suffer by thes same subtyll spyes. And lett me have ryght as ye are a ryghtfull kyng, Apoyntyd of God to have such mater in doyng; For God wyllyth yow to helpe the pore wydowes cause, As he by Esaye protesteth in this same clause: Querite iudicium subvenite oppresso, Iudicate pupillo defendite viduam: Seke ryght to poore, to the weake and faterlesse, Defende the wydowe whan she is in dystresse. Sedicyon I tell ye the woman ys in great hevynes. K. Johan I may not in no wyse leve thi ryght undyscuste, For God hath sett me, by his apoyntment just, To further thy cause and to mayntayne thi ryght, And therfor I wyll supporte the daye and nyght. So long as my symple lyffe shall here indewer, I wyll se the have no wrong, be fast and swer. I wyll fyrst of all call my nobylyte, Dwkis, erlyes and lordes, yche on in ther degre; Next them the clargy or fathers spirituall, Archebysshopes, bysshoppes, abbottes and pryers all; Than the great juges and lawers everychon, So opynyng to them thi cause and petyfull mone, By the meanys wherof I shall ther myndes understonde. Yf they helpe the not my selfe wyll take yt in honde And sett such a waye as shall be to thi conforte. Englande Than for an answare I wyll shortly ageyne resort. K. Johan Do, Ynglond, hardly, and thow shalt have remedy. Englande God reward yowre Grace, I be seche hym hartely, And send yow longe dayes to governe this realme in peace. God owt Ynglond and drese for Clargy. K. Johan Gramercy, Yngland, and send the plentyus increse. Sedicyon Of bablyng matters I trow yt is tyme to cease. K. Johan Why dost thow call them bablyng maters? Tell me. Sedicyon For they are not worth the shakyng of a pertre Whan the peres are gon: they are but dyble-dable. I marvell ye can abyd suche byble-bable. K. Johan Thow semyst to be a man of symple dyscrescyon. Sedicyon Alas, that ye are not a pryst to here confessyon. K. Johan Why for confessyon? Lett me know thi fantasye. Sedicyon Becawse that ye are a man so full of mercye, Namely to women that wepe with a hevy harte Whan they in the churche hath lett but a lytyll farte. K. Johan I perseyve well now thow speakyst all this in mockage Becawse I take parte with Englandes ryghtfull herytage. Say thu what thow wylt, her mater shall not peryshe. Sedicyon Yt is joye of hym that women so can cheryshe. K. Johan God hathe me ordeynned in this same princely estate, For that I shuld helpe such as be desolate. Sedicyon Yt is as great pyte to se a woman wepe As yt is to se a sely dodman crepe, Or, as ye wold say, a sely goose go barefote. K. Johan Thow semyste by thy wordes to have no more wytt than a coote. I mervell thow arte to Englond so un naturall: Beyng her owne chyld thow art worse than a best brutall. Sedicyon I am not her chyld: I defye hyr, by the messe! I her sonne, quoth he! I had rather she wer hedlesse. Thowgh I sumtyme be in Englond for my pastaunce, Yet was I neyther borne here, in Spayne, nor in Fraunce, But under the Pope in the holy cyte of Rome, And there wyll I dwell un to the daye of dome. K. Johan But what is thy name? Tell me yett onys agayne. Sedicyon As I sayd afore, I am Sedycyon playne: In every relygyon and munkysh secte I rayne, Havyng yow prynces in scorne, hate and dysdayne. K. Johan I pray the, good frynd, tell me what ys thy facyon. Sedicyon Serche and ye shall fynd in every congregacyon That long to the Pope, for they are to me full swer, And wyll be so long as they last and endwer. K. Johan Yff thow be a cloysterer, tell of what order thow art. Sedicyon In every estate of the clargye I playe a part: Sumtyme I can be a monke in a long syd cowle; Sumtyme I can be a none and loke lyke an owle; Sumtyme a channon in a syrples fayer and whyght; A chapterhowse monke sumtym I apere in syght; I am ower Syre Johan, sumtyme with a new shaven crowne; Sumtym the person and swepe the stretes with a syd gowne; Sumtyme the bysshoppe with a myter and a cope; A graye fryer sumtyme with cutt shoes and a rope; Sumtyme I can playe the whyght monke, symtyme the fryer, The purgatory prist and every mans wyffe desyer. This cumpany hath provyded for me morttmayne, For that I myght ever among ther sort remayne. Yea, to go farder, sumtyme I am a cardynall, Yea, sumtyme a pope, and than am I lord over all, Bothe in hevyn and erthe, and also in purgatory, And do weare thre crownes whan I am in my glorye. K. Johan But what doeste thow here in England? Tell me shortlye. Sedicyon I hold upp the Pope as in other places many, For his ambassador I am contynwally In Sycell, in Naples, in Venys and Ytalye, In Pole, Spruse, and [Beme], in Denmarke and Lumbardye, In Aragon, in Spayne, in Fraunce, and in Germanye, In Ynglond, in Scotlond, and in other regyons elles. For his holy cawse I mayntayne traytors and rebelles, That no prince can have his peples obedyence, Except yt doth stand with the Popes prehemynence. K. Johan Gett the hence, thow knave, and moste presumptuows wreche, Or as I am trew kyng thow shalt an halter streche! We wyll thow know yt owre powre ys of God, And therfor we wyll so execute the rod That no lewde pryst shall be able to mayneteyne the. I se now they be at to mych lyberte; We wyll short ther hornys yf God send tyme and space. Sedicyon Than I in Englon[d] am lyke to have no place? K. Johan No, that thow arte not, and therfor avoyd apace. Sedicyon By the holy masse, I must lawgh to here yowre grace! Ye suppose and thynke that ye cowd me subdewe: Ye shall never fynd yowre supposycyon trewe, Thowgh ye wer as strong as Hector and Diomedes, Or as valyant as ever was Achylles. Ye are well content that bysshoppes contynew styll? K. Johan We are so in dede, yf they ther dewte fullfyll. Sedicyon Nay than, good inowgh! Yowre awtoryte and powre Shall passe as they wyll; they have sawce bothe swet and sowre. K. Johan What mennyst thow by that? Shew me thi intente this howre. Sedicyon They are Godes vycars: they can both save and lose. K. Johan Ah, thy meenyng ys that they maye a prynce depose. Sedicyon By the rood, they may, and that wyll appere by yow. K. Johan Be the helpe of God, we shall se to that well inow. Sedicyon Nay that ye can not, thowgh ye had Argus eyes, In abbeyes they have so meny suttyll spyes. For ones in the yere they have secret vysytacyons, And yf ony prynce reforme ther ungodly facyons, Than two of the monkes must forthe to Rome by and by With secrett letters to avenge ther injury. For a thowsand pownd they shrynke not in soch matter, And yet for the tyme the prynce to his face they flater. I am ever more ther gyde and ther advocate. K. Johan Than with the bysshoppes and monkes thow art checke mate. Sedicyon I dwell among them and am one of ther sorte. K. Johan For thy sake they shall of me have but small conforte; Loke wher I fynd the that place wyll I put downe. Sedicyon What yf ye do chance to fynd me in every towne Where as is fownded any sect monastycall. K. Johan I pray God I synke yf I dystroye them not all. Sedicyon Well yf ye so do yett know I where to dwell. K. Johan Thow art not skoymose thy fantasy for to tell. Sedicyon Gesse at a ventureâ ye may chance the marke to hytt. K. Johan Thy falssed to shew no man than thy selfe more fytt. Sedicyon Mary, in confessyon under-nethe benedicite. K. Johan Nay, tell yt ageyne that I may understond the. Sedicyon I saye I can dwell whan all other placys fayle me In ere confessyon undernethe benedicite, And whan I am ther the pryst may not bewray me. K. Johan Why, wyll ere confesshon soch a secret traytor be? Sedicyon Whan all other fayle he is so swre as stele. Offend Holy Churche and I warant ye shall yt fele; For by confessyon the Holy Father knoweth Throw owt all Christendom what to his holynes growyth. K. Johan Oh where ys Nobylyte that he myght knowe thys falshed? Sedicyon Nay he is becum a meyntener of owre godhed. I know that he wyll do Holy Chyrche no wronge For I am his gostly father and techear amonge. He belevyth nothyng but as Holy Chyrch doth tell. K. Johan Why, geveth he no credence to Cristes holy gospell? Sedicyon No, ser, by the messe, but he callyth them herytyckes That preche the gospell, and sedycyows scysmatyckes; He tache them, vex them, from preson to preson he turne them, He indygth them, juge them, and in conclusyon he burne them. K. Johan We rewe to here this of owre Nobylyte; But in this behalfe what seyst of the spretuallte? Sedicyon Of this I am swerâ to them to be no stranger And spesyally whan ther honor ys in dawnger. K. Johan We trust owre lawers have no such wyckyd myndes. Sedicyon Yes, they many tymys are my most secrett fryndes. With faythfull precheres they can play leger demayne, And with falce colores procure them to be slayne. K. Johan I perseyve this worlde is full of iniquite. As God wold have yt, here cummyth Nobylyte. Sedicyon Doth he so in dede? By owre Lord, than wyll I hence. K. Johan Thow saydest thow woldyst dwell where he kepyth resydence. Sedicyon Yea, but fyrst of all I must chaunge myn apparell Unto a bysshoppe to maynetayene with my quarell, To a monke or pryst or to sum holy fryer. I shud never elles accomplych my dysyre. K. Johan Why, art thow goyng? Naye, brother, thow shalte not hence. Sedicyon I wold not be sene as I am for fortye pence. Whan I am relygyouse I wyll returne agayne. K. Johan Thow shalt tary here, or I must put the to payne. Sedicyon I have a great mynd to be a lecherous manâ A wengonce take ytâ I wold saye a relygyous man. I wyll go and cum so fast as evyre I can. K. Johan Tush, dally not with me! I saye thow shalt abyde. Sedicyon Wene yow to hold me that I shall not slyppe asyde? K. Johan Make no more prattyng for I saye thow shalt abyde. Sedicyon Stoppe not my passage: I must over see at the next tyde. K. Johan I wyll ordeyne so: I trowe thow shalt not over. Sedicyon Tush, tush, I am sewer of redy passage at Dover. Her go owt Sedwsion and drese for Syvyll Ordere. K. Johan The devyll go with hym! The unthryftye knave is gon. [Enter Nobility.] Nobylyte Troble not yowre sylfe with no soch dyssolute persone, For ye knowe full well very lyttell honeste Ys gote at there handes in every commynnalte. K. Johan This is but dallyaunce: ye do not speke as ye thynke. Nobylyte By my trowthe I do, or elles I wold I shuld synke. K. Johan Than must I marvell at yow of all men lyvynge. Nobylyte Why mervell at me? Tell me yowre very menyng. K. Johan For no man levyng is in more famylyerite With that wycked wrech, yf it be trew that he told me. Nobylyte What wrech speke ye of? For Jesus love intymate. K. Johan Of that preseumtous wrech that was with me here of late, Whom yow wyllyd not to vexe my selfe withall. Nobylyte I know hym not, I, by the waye that my sowll to shall! K. Johan Make yt not so strange, for ye know hym wyll I now. Nobylyte Beleve me yff ye wyll, I know hym not, I assuer yow. K. Johan Ware ye never yett aquantyd with Sedissyon? Nobylyte Syns I was a chyld both hym and his condycyon I ever hated for his iniquite. [Enter Clergy.] K. Johan A clere tokyn that is of trew nobelyte. But I pray to God we fynde yt not other wyse. Yt was never well syns the clargy wrowght by practyse And left the scriptur for menns ymagynacyons, Dyvydyng them selvys in so many congrygacyons Of monkes, chanons and fryers of dyvers colors and facyons. Clergye I do trust yowre grace wyll be as lovyng now As yowre predysessours have bene to us before yow. K. Johan I wyll suer wey my love with yowre behavers; Lyke as ye deserve so wyll I bere yow favers. Clargy, marke yt well; I have more to yow to say Than, as the sayeng is, the prist dyd speke a Sonday. Clergye Ye wyll do us no wrong, I hope, nor injurye. K. Johan No, I wyll do yow ryght in seyng yow do yowre dewtye. We know the cawtelles of yowre sotyll companye. Clergye Yf ye do us wrong we shall seke remedy. K. Johan Yea, that is the cast of all yowre company. Whan kynges correcte yow for yowre actes most ungodly To the pope syttyng in the chayer of pestoolens Ye ronne, to remayne in yowre concupysens. Thus sett ye at nowght all princely prehemynens, Subdewyng the ordere of dew obedyens. But within a whyle I shall so abate yowre pryde That to yowre popet ye shall noyther runne nor ryde, But ye shall be glad to seke to me yowre prynce For all such maters as shall be with in this provynce, Lyke as God wyllyth yow by his scripture evydente. Nobylyte To the Church I trust ye wyll be obedyent? K. Johan No mater to yow whether I be so or no. Nobylyte Yes, mary, is yt, for I am sworne therunto: I toke a great othe whan I was dubbyd a knyght Ever to defend the Holy Churches ryght. Clergye Yea, and in her quarell ye owght onto deth to fyght. K. Johan Lyke backes, in the darke y[e] alweys take yowre flyght, Flytteryng in fanseys, and ever abhorre the lyght. I rew yt in hart that yow, Nobelyte, Shuld thus bynd yowre selfe to the grett captyvyte Of blody Babulon the grownd and mother of whordomâ The Romych Churche I meane, more vyle than ever was Sodom, And to say the trewth a mete spowse for the fynd. [Enter Civil Order.] Clergye Yowre grace ys fare gonne: God send yow a better mynd. K. Johan Hold yowre peace, I say, ye are a lytyll to fatte. In a whyle, I hope, ye shall be lener sumwhatte. We shall loke to yow and to Civyll Order also: Ye walke not so secrett but we know wher abowght ye goo. Cyvyle Order Why, yowre grace hath no cawse with me to be dysplesyd. K. Johan All thynges consyderyd we have small cause to be plesyd. Cyvyle Order I be sech yowre grace to graunt me a word or too. K. Johan Speke on yowre pleasur and yowre hole mynd also. Cyvyle Order Ye know very well to set all thynges in order I have moche ado and many thynges passe fro me For yowre common welth, and that in every border, For offyces, for londes, for lawe and for lyberte: And for traunsgressors I appoynt the penalte That cytes and townes maye stand in quiotose peace, That all theft and murder with other vyce maye seace. Yff I have chaunsed for want of cyrcumspeccyon To passe the lymytes of ryght and equite, I submyte my selfe unto yowre graces correccyon, Desyryng pardon of yowre benyngnyte. I wot I maye fall throwgh my fragylyte, Therfor I praye yow tell me what the mater ys, And amendes shall be where as I have done amyse. K. Johan Aganste amendement no resounable man can be. Nobylyte That sentence rysyth owt of an hygh charyte. K. Johan Now that ye are her assembled all together, Amongeste other thynges ye shall fyrst of all consyder That my dysplesure rebounyth on to yow all. Clergye To yow non of us ys prejudycyall. K. Johan I shall prove yt, yes. How have ye usyd Englond? Nobylyte But as yt becommyth us so fare as I understond. K. Johan Yes, the pore woman complayneth her grevosly, And not withowt a cawse, for she hath great injurye. I must se to yt, ther ys no remedy, For it ys a charge gevyn me from God allmyghtye. How saye ye, Clargye, apperyth it not so to yow? Clergye Yf it lykyth yowre grace, all we knowe that well ynow. K. Johan Than yow, Nobelyte, wyll affyrme yt, I am suer. Nobylyte Ye, that I wyll, sur, so long as my lyfe indure. K. Johan And yow, Cyvyll Order, I thynke wyll graunte the same? Cyvyle Order Ondowghted, ser, yea; elles ware yt to me gret shame. K. Johan Than for Englandes cause I wyll be sumewhat playne. Yt is yow, Clargy, that hathe her in dysdayne. With yowre Latyne howres, serymonyes and popetly playes. In her more and more Godes holy worde decayes, And them to maynteyn unresonable ys the spoyle Of her londes, her goodes, and of her pore chylderes toyle. Rekyn fyrst yowre tythis, yowre devocyons and yowre offrynges, Mortuaryes, pardons, bequestes and other thynges, Besydes that ye cache for halowed belles and purgatorye, For iwelles, for relyckes, confessyon and cowrtes of baudrye, For legacyes, trentalles with scalacely messys, Wherby ye have made the people very assys: And over all this ye have browght in a rabyll Of Latyne mummers and sectes desseyvabyll Evyn to dewore her and eat her upp attonnys. Clergye Yow wold have no churche, I wene, by thes sacred bones. K. Johan Yes, I wold have a churche, not of dysgysyd shavelynges, But of faythfull hartes and charytable doynges; For whan Christes chyrch was in her hyeste glory She knew neyther thes sectes nor ther ipocrysy. Clergye Yes, I wyll prove yt by David substancyally: Astitit Regina a dextris tuis in vestitu deaurato circumdata varietate. A quene, sayth Davyd, on thy ryght hond, lord, I se, Apparrellyd with golde and compassyd with dyversyte. K. Johan What ys yowre meanyng by that same scriptur? Tell me. Clergye This quene ys the Chyrch which thorow all Cristen regions Ys beawtyfull, [deckyd] with many holy relygyons: Munkes, chanons and fryeres, most excellent dyvynis, As Grandy Montensers and other Benedictyns, Premonstratensers, Bernardes and Gylbertynys, Jacobytes, Mynors, Whyght Carmes and Augustynis, Sanbonites, Cluniackes, with holy Carthusyans, Heremytes and Auncors, with most myghty Rodyans, Crucifers, Lucifers, Brigettes, Ambrosyanes, Stellifers, Ensifers, with Purgatoryanes, Sophyanes, Indianes and Camaldulensers, Jesuytes, Joannytes, with Clarimontensers, Clarynes and Columbynes, Templers, Newe Ninivytes, Rufyanes, Tercyanes, Lorytes and Lazarytes, Hungaryes, Teutonyckes, Hospitelers, Honofrynes, Basyles and Bonhams, Sclavons and Celestynes, Paulynes, Hieronymytes, and Monkes of Josaphathes Valleye, Fulygynes, Flamynes, with Bretherne of the Black Alleye, Donates and Dimysynes, with Canons of S. Mark, Vestals and Monyals, a worlde to heare them barke, Abbottes and doctors, with bysshoppes and cardynales, Arche decons and pristes, as to ther fortune falles. Cyvyle Order Me thynkyth yowre fyrst text stondeth nothyng with yo[w]re reson, For in Davydes tyme wer no such sectes of relygyon. K. Johan Davyd meanyth vertuys by the same diversyte, As in the sayd psalme yt is evydent to se And not munkysh sectes; but yt is ever yowre cast For yowre advauncement the Scripturs for to wrast. Clergye Of owre holy father in this I take my grownd, Which hathe awtoryte the Scripturs to expond. K. Johan Naye, he presumyth the Scripturs to confownd. Nowther thow nor the Pope shall do pore Englond wronge, I beyng governor and kyng her peple amonge Whyle yow for lucre sett forth yowre popysh lawys Yowre selvys to advaunce ye wold make us pycke strawes. Nay, ipocrytes, nay! We wyll not be scornyd soo Of a sort of knavys. We shall loke yow otherwyse too. Nobylyte Sur, yowre sprytes are movyd I persayve by yowre langage. K. Johan I wonder that yow for such veyne popych baggage Can suffyre Englond to be impoveryshyd And mad a begger; ye are very yll advysyd. Nobylyte I marvell grettly that ye saye thus to me. K. Johan For dowghtles ye do not as becummyth Nobelyte; Ye spare nouther landes nor goodes, but all ye geve To thes cormerantes; yt wold any good man greve To se yowre madnes, as I wold God shuld save me. Nobylyte Sur, I suppose yt good to bylde a perpetuite For me and my frendes to be prayed for evermore. K. Johan Tush, yt is madnes all to dyspayre in God so sore And to thynke Christes deth to be unsufficient. Nobylyte Sur, that I have don was of a good intent. K. Johan The intente ys nowght which hath no sewer grounde. Clergye Yff yow continue ye wyll Holy Chyrch confunde. K. Johan Nay, no Holy Chyrch, nor feythfull congregacyon, But an hepe of adders of Antecristes generacyon. Cyvyle Order Yt pyttyth me moche that ye are to them so harde. K. Johan Yt petyeth me more that ye them so mych regarde. They dystroye mennys sowlles with damnable supersticyon, And decaye all realmys by meyntenaunce of sedycyon. Ye wold wonder to know what profe I have of this. Nobylyte Well amenment shalbe wher any thyng is amysse, For, undowtted, God doth open soche thynges to prynces As to none other men in the Cristyen provynces And therfor we wyll not in this with yowre Grace contend. Cyvyle Order No, but with Godes grace we shall owre mysededes amend. Clergye For all such forfetes as yowre pryncely mageste For yowre owne person or realme can prove by me, I submytte my selfe to yow, bothe body and goodes. Knele. K. Johan We pety yow now, consyderyng yowre repentante modes, And owre gracyous pardone we grante yow upon amendment. Clergye God preserve yowre Grace and Mageste excelent! K. Johan Aryse, Clargy, aryse, and ever be obedyent, And as God commandeth yow take us for yowre governere. Clergye By the grace of God, the Pope shall be my rulare. K. Johan What saye ye, Clargy? Who ys yowre governer? Clergye Ha, ded I stomble? I sayd my prynce ys my ruler. K. Johan I pray to owre Lord this obedyence maye indewre. Clergye I wyll not breke yt ye may be fast and suer. K. Johan Than cum hether all thre: ye shall know more of my mynde. Clergye Owre kyng to obeye the Scriptur doth us bynde. K. Johan Ye shall fyrst be sworne to God and to the crowne To be trew and juste in every cetye and towne, And this to performe set hand and kysse the bocke. Cyvyle Order With the wyffe of Loth we wyll not backeward locke Nor turne from owre oth, but ever obeye yowre grace. K. Johan Than wyll I gyve yow yowre chargys her in place And accepte yow all to be of owre hyghe councell. Clergye, Nobylyte, Cyvyle Order To be fayth full than ye us more streytly compell. K. Johan For the love of God loke to the state of Englond! Leate non enemy holde her in myserable bond. Se yow defend her as yt becummyth nobilite, Se yow instrutte her acordyng to yowre degre, Fournysh her yow with a cyvyle honeste. Thus shall she florysh in honor and grett plente. With godly wysdom yowre maters so conveye That the commynnalte the powers maye obeye, And ever be-ware of that false these Sedycyon, Whych poysennyth all realmes and bryng them to perdycyon. Nobylyte Sur, for soche wrecches we wyll be so circumspectte That neyther ther falsed nor gylle shall us infecte. Clergye I warrant yow, sur, no, and that shall well apere. Cyvyle Order We wyll so provyde yff anye of them cum here To dysturbe the realme they shall be full glad to fle. K. Johan Well, yowre promyse includeth no small dyffyculte: But I put the case that this false these Sedycyon Shuld cum to yow thre and call hym selfe Relygyon: Myght he not under the pretence of holynes Cawse yow to consent to myche ungodlynes? Nobylyte He shall never be able to do yt veryly. K. Johan God graunt ye be not deceyvyd by hypocresye. I say no more, I. In shepes aparell sum walke And seme relygeyose that deceyvably can calke. Beware of soche hipocrites as the kyngdom of hevyn from man Do hyde for awantage, for they deceyve now and than. Well I leve yow here; yche man consyder his dewtye. Nobylyte With Godes leve, no faute shall be in this companye. K. Johan Cum, Cyvyle Order, ye shall go hence with me. Cyvyle Order At yowre commandmente I wyll gladlye wayte upon ye. Here Kyng Johan and Sivile Order go owt: and Syvile Order drese hym for Sedewsyon. Nobylyte Me thynke the kyng is a man of a wonderfull wytt. Clergye Naye, saye that he ys of a vengeable craftye wytt, Than shall ye be sure the trewth of the thyng to hytt. Hard ye not how he of the Holy Church dyd rayle? His extreme thretynynges shall lytyll hym avayle: I wyll worke soch wayes that he shall of his purpose fayle. Nobylyte Yt is meet a prince to saye sumwhat for his plesure. Clergye Yea, but yt is to moch to rayle so withowt mesure. Nobylyte Well, lett every man speke lyke as he hathe a cawse. Clergye Why do ye say so? Yt is tyme for me than to pawse. Nobylyte This wyll I saye, sur, that he ys so noble a prince As this day raygneth in ony Cristyne provynce. Clergye Mary, yt apereth well by that he wonne in Fraunce! Nobylyte Well, he lost not ther so moche by marcyall chaunce, But he gate moche more in Scotland, Ireland and Wales. Clergye Yea, God sped us well: Crystmes songes are mery tales! Nobylyte Ye dysdayne soche mater as ye know full evydent. Are not bothe Ireland and Wales to hym obedyent? Yes, he holdyth them bothe in pessable possessyon, Andâby cause I wyll not from yowre tall make degressyonâ For his lond in Fraunce he gyveth but lytell forsse, Havyng to Englond all his love and remorse; And Angoye he gave to Artur his nevy in chaunge. Clergye Owre changes are soch that an abbeye turneth to a graunge. We are so handled we have scarce eyther horse or male. Nobylyte He that dothe hate me the worse wyll tell my tale. Yt is yowre fassyon soche kynges to dyscommend As yowre abuses reforme or reprehend. Yow pristes are the cawse that Chronycles doth defame So many prynces and men of notable name, For yow take upon yow to wryght them evermore; And therfor Kyng Johan ys lyke to rewe yt sore Whan ye wryte his tyme for vexcyng of the clargy. Clergye I mervell ye take his parte so ernestlye. Nobylyte Yt becommyth Nobelyte his prynces fame to preserve. Clergye Yf he contynew we are lyke in a whyle to starve: He demaundeth of us the tenth parte of owre lyvyng. Nobylyte I thynke yt is then for sum nessessary thyng. Clergye Mary to recover that he hath lost in Fraunce, As Normandy dewkedom and his land beyond Orleaunce. Nobylyte And thynke ye not that a mater nessesary? Clergye No, sur, by my trowth, he takyng yt of the clergy. Nobylyte Ye cowde be content that he shuld take yt of us? Clergye Yea, so that he wold spare the clargy, by swet Jesus! This takyng of us myght sone growe to a custom, And than Holy Churche myght so be browght to thraldom, Whych hath ben ever from temporall prynces free As towchyng trybute or other captyvyte. Nobylyte He that defendeth yow owght to have parte of yowre goodes. Clergye He hath the prayers of all them that hathe hoodes. Nobylyte Why, ys that inowgh to helpe hym in his warre? Clergye The Churche he may not of lyberte debarre. Nobylyte Ded not Crist hym selfe paye trybytt unto Cesere? Yf he payd trybute, so owght his holy vycar. Clergye To here ye reson so ondyscretlye I wonder. Ye must consyder that Cryst that tyme was under, But his vycar now ys above the prynces all; Therfor be ware ye do not to herysy fall. Ye owght to beleve as Holy Churche doth teche yow, And not to reason in soche hygh materes now. Nobylyte I am unlernyd, my wyttes are sone confowndyd. Clergye Than leve soch materes to men more depely growndyd. Nobylyte But how wyll ye do for the othe that ye have take? Clergye The keyes of the Church can all soche materes of shake. Nobylyte What call ye those kyes? I pray yow hartly, tell me! Clergye Owre Holy Fathers powre and his hygh autoryte. Nobylyte Well, I can no more say: ye are to well lernyd for me. My bysynes ys soche that here now I must leve ye. Clergye I must hence also so fast as ever maye be, To sewe unto Rome for the Churches lyberte. Go owt Nobylyte and Clargy. Here Sedycyon cummyth in. Sedicyon Have in onys ageyne, in spyght of all myn enymyes, For they can not dryve me from all mennys companyes; And thowgh yt wer so that all men wold forsake me, Yet dowght I yt not but sume good women wold take me. I loke for felowys that here shuld make sum sporte. I mervell yt is so longe ere they resorte. By the messe, I wene the knaves are in the bryers, Or elles they are fallen in to sum order of fryers. Naye, shall I gesse ryght? They are gon into the stues. I holde ye my necke anon we shall here newes. Seyng the Leteny. Lyst, for Godes passyon! I trow her cummeth sum hoggherd Callyng for his pygges: such a noyse I never herd! Here cum Dyssymulacy[on] syngyng of the Le[t]any. Dissymulacyon syng Sancte Dominice, ora pro nobis. Sedicyon syng Sancte pyld monache, I beshrow vobis. Dissymulacyon syng Sa[n]cte Francisse, ora pro nobis. Sedicyon Here ye not? Cockes sowle, what meaneth this ypocryte knave? Dissymulacyon Pater noster, I pray God bryng hym sone to his grave; Qui es in celis, with an vengeable sanctyficetur, Or elles Holy Chyrche shall never thryve, by Saynt Peter. Sedicyon Tell me, good felowe, makyste thow this prayer for me? Dissymulacyon Ye are as ferce as thowgh ye had broke yowre nose at the buttre. I medyll not with the, but here to good sayntes I praye, Agenst soch enmyes as wyll Holy Chyrche decaye. Here syng this: A Johanne Rege iniquo, libera nos, Domine. Sedicyon Leve, I saye, or by the messe, I wyll make yow grone. Dissymulacyon Yff thow be jentyll, I pray the, leate me alone. For with in a whyle my devocyon wyll be gone. Sedicyon And wherfor dost thow praye here so bytterly, Momblyng thy Pater noster and chauntyng the Letany? Dissymulacyon For that Holy Chyrch myght save hyr patrymonye, And to have of Kyng Johan a tryumphnt vyctorye. Sedicyon And why of Kyng Johan? Doth he vexe yow so sore? Dissymulacyon Bothe chyrchys and abbeys he oppressyth more and more, And take of the clergye âyt is onresonable to tell. Sedicyon Owte with the Popys bulles, than, and cursse hym downe to hell. Dissymulacyon Tushe, man, we have done so, but all that wyll not helpe. He regardyth no more the Pope than he dothe a whelpe. Sedicyon Well, lett hym alone; for that wyll I geve hym a scelpe. But what arte thow callyd of thyn owne munkych nacyon? Dissymulacyon Kepe yt in counsell: Dane Davy Dyssymulacyon. Sedicyon What, Dyssymulacyon? Cokes sowle, myn old aquenteunce! Par me faye, mon amye, je [suis] tote ad voutre plesaunce. Dissymulacyon Gramercyes, good frend, with all my very hert. I trust we shall talke more frely or we deperte. Sedicyon Why, vylayn horson! Knowyst not thi cosyn Sedycyon.? Dissymulacyon I have ever loved both the and thy condycyon. Sedicyon Thow must nedes, I trowe, for we cum of two bretherne: Yf thow remember, owre fatheres were on manns chylderneâ Thow commyst of Falsed, and I of Prevy Treason. Dissymulacyon Than Infydelyte owre granfather ys by reason. Sedicyon Mary, that ys trewe, and his begynner Antycrist, The great Pope of Rome or fyrst veyne popysh prist. Dissymulacyon Now welcum, cosyn, by the waye that my sowle shall to! Sedicyon Gramercy, cosyn, by the holy bysshope Benno. Thow kepyst thi old wont; thow art styll an abbe mann. Dissymulacyon To hold all thynges up I play my part now and than. Sedicyon Why, what manere of offyce hast thow within the abbey? Dissymulacyon Of all relygyons I kepe the chyrch dore keye. Sedicyon Than of a lykelyhod thow art ther generall porter. Dissymulacyon Nay, of munkes and chanons I am the suttyll sorter. Whyle sum talke with Besse, the resydewe kepe sylence. Thowgh we playe the knavys we must shew a good pretence. Where so ever sum eate a serten kepe the froyter; Where so ever sum slepe sum must nedes kepe the dorter. Dedyst thow never know the maner of owre senyes? Sedicyon I was never with them aqueyntyd, by Seynt Denyes. Dissymulacyon Than never knewyst thow the knavery of owre menyes. Yf I shuld tell all I cowd saye more than that. Sedicyon Now, of good felowshyppe, I beseche the show me what. Dissymulacyon The profytable lucre cummyth ever in by me. Sedicyon But by what meane? Tell me, I hartely pray the. Dissymulacyon To wynne the peple I appoynt yche man his place: Sum to syng Latyn, and sum to ducke at grace; Sum to go mummyng, and sum to beare the crosse; Sum to stowpe downeward, as ther heades ware stopt with mosse; Sum rede the epystle and gospell at hygh masse; Sum syng at the lectorne with long eares lyke an asse. The pawment of the Chyrche the aunchent faders tredes, Sumtyme with a portas, sumtyme with a payre of bedes; And this exedyngly drawth peple to devoycyone, Specyally whan they do se so good relygeon. Than have we imagys of Seynt Spryte and Seynt Savyer: Moche is the sekynge of them to gett ther faver; Yong whomen berfote and olde men seke them brecheles. The myracles wrowght ther I can in nowyse expresse. We lacke noyther golde, nor sylwer gyrdles, nor rynges, Candelles, nor tapperes, nor other customyd offerynges. Thowgh I seme a shepe, I can play the suttle foxe: I can make Latten to bryng this gere to the boxe. Tushe, Latten ys alone to bryng soche mater to passe; Ther ys no Englyche that can soche profyghtes compasse. And therfor we wyll no servyce to be songe, Gospell nor pystell, but all in Latten tonge. Of owre suttell dryftes many more poyntes are behynde; Yf I tolde yow all, we shuld never have an ende. Sedicyon In nomine Patris, of all that ever I hard Thow art alone yet of soche a dremyng bussard! Dissymulacyon Nay, dowst thow not se how I in my colours jette? To blynd the peple I have yet a farther fette. This is for Bernard, and this is for Benet, This is for Gylbard, and this is for Jhenet; For Frauncys this is, and this is for Domynyke, For Awsten and Elen, and this is for Seynt Partryk. We have many rewlles, but never one we kepe; Whan we syng full lowde owre hartes be fast aslepe. We resemble sayntes in gray, whyte, blacke and blewe, Yet unto prynces not one of owre nomber treweâ And that shall kyng Johan prove shortly, by the rode. Sedicyon But in the meane tyme yowre selves gett lytyll good; Yowre abbeys go downe, I here saye every where. Dissymulacyon Yea, frynd Sedysyon, but thow must se to that gere. Sedicyon Than must I have helpe, by swete Saynt Benettes cuppe. Dissymulacyon Thow shalt have a chyld of myn owne bryngyng uppe. Sedicyon Of thy bryngyng uppe! Cokes sowle, what knave is that. Dissymulacyon Mary, Pryvat Welth; now hayve I tolde the what. I made hym a monke and a perfytt cloysterer, And in the abbeye he becam fyrst celerere, Than pryor, than abbote of a thowsand pownd land, no wors. Now he is a bysshoppe and rydeth with an hondryd hors, And, as I here say, he is lyke to be cardynall. Sedicyon Ys he so in dede? By the masse, than have att all! Dissymulacyon Nay, fyrst, Pryvat Welth shall bryng in Usurpyd Powre With his autoryte, and than the gam ys ower. Sedicyon Tush, Usurpyd Powre dothe faver me of all men, For in his trobles I ease his hart now and then. Whan prynces rebell agenste hys autoryte I make ther commons agenst them for to be. Twenty thousand men are but a mornyng breckefast To be slayne for hym, he takyng his repast. Dissymulacyon Thow hast, I persayve, a very suttyll cast. Sedicyon I am for the Pope as for the shyppe the mast. Dissymulacyon Than helpe, Sedycyon, I may styll in Englond be: Kyng Johan hath thre[t]ned that I shall over see. Sedicyon Well, yf thow wylte of me have remedy this owre, Go feche Pryvat Welth and also Usurpyd Powre. Dissymulacyon I can bryng but one be Mary, Jesus mother. Sedicyon Bryng thow in the one and let hym bryng in the other. Here cum in Usurpyd Powre and Private Welth, syngyng on after another. Usurpid Powre syng this: Super flumina Babilonis suspendimus organa nostra. Privat Welth syng this: Quomodo cantabimus canticum bonum in terra aliena. Sedicyon By the mas, me thynke they are syngyng of placebo. Dissymulacyon Peace, for with my spectakles vadam et videbo. Cokes sowll, yt is they: at the last I have smellyd them owt. Her go and bryng them. Sedicyon Thow mayst be a sowe yf thow hast so good a snowt. Sures, marke well this gere for now yt begynnyth to worke: False Dyssymulacyon doth bryng in Privat Welth; And Usurpyd Powre, which is more ferce than a Turcke, Cummeth in by hym to decayve all spyrytuall helth; Than I by them bothe, as clere experyence telth. We four by owre craftes Kyng Johan wyll so subdwe That for three hundred yers all Englond shall yt rewe. Dissymulacyon Of the clargy, fryndes, report lyke as ye se, That ther Privat Welth cummyth ever in by me. Sedicyon But by whom commyst thow? By the messe, evyn by the devyll, For the grownd thow arte of the Cristen peplys evyll. Dissymulacyon And what are yow, ser? I praye yow say good be me. Sedicyon By my trowth, I cum by the and thy affynyte. Dissymulacyon Feche thow in thy felow so fast as ever thow can. Privat Welth I trow thow shalt se me now playe the praty man. Of me, Privat Welth, cam fyrst Usurpyd Powre: Ye may perseyve yt in pagent here this howre. Sedicyon Now welcum, felowys, by all thes bonys and naylys! Usurpid Powre Among companyons good felyshyp never faylys. Sedicyon Nay, Usurpid Powre, thow must go backe ageyne, For I must also put the to a lytyll payne. Usurpid Powre Why, fellaue Sedycyon, what wyll thow have me do? Sedicyon To bare me on thi backe and bryng me in also That yt maye be sayde that fyrst Dyssymulacyon Browght in Privat Welth to every Cristen nacyon, And that Privat Welth browght in Usurpid Powre, And he Sedycyon in cytye, towne and tower That sum man may know the feche of all owre sorte. Usurpid Powre Cum on thy wayes, than, that thow mayst make the fort. Dissymulacyon Nay, Usurped Powre, we shall bare hym all thre, Thy selfe, he, and I, yf ye wyll be rewlyd by me. For ther is non of us but in hym hath a stroke. Privat Welth The horson knave wayeth and yt were a croked oke! Here they shall bare hym in, and Sedycyon saythe Sedicyon Yea, thus it shuld be. Mary, now [I am] alofte I wyll beshyte yow all yf ye sett me not downe softe. In my opynyon, by swete Saynt Antony, Here is now gatheryd a full honest company. Here is nowther Awsten, Ambrose, Hierom nor Gregory, But here is a sorte of companyons moch more mery. They of the Chirch than wer fower holy doctors, We of the Chirch now are the fower generall proctors. Here ys fyrst of all good father Dyssymulacyon, The fyrst begynner of this same congregacyon; Here is Privat Welthe which hath the Chyrch infecte With all abusyons and brought yt to a synfull secte; Here ys Usurpid Powre, that all kynges doth subdwe With such autoryte as is neyther good ner trewe: And I last of all am evyn sance pere Sedycyon. Usurpid Powre Under hevyn ys not a mor knave in condycyon. Wher as thow dost cum that common welth can not thryve. By owre Lord, I marvell that thow art yet alyve! Privat Welth Wher herbes are pluckte upp the wedes many tymes remayne. Dissymulacyon No man can utter an evydence more playn. Sedicyon Yea, ye thynke so, yow? Now Godes blyssyng breke yowre heade. I can do but lawgh to her yow, by this breade! I am so mery that we are mett, by Saynt John, I fele not the ground that I do go uppon. For the love of God, lett us have sum mery songe. Usurpid Powre Begyne thy self than, and we shall lepe in amonge. Here syng. Sedicyon I wold ever dwell here to have such mery sporte. Privat Welth Thow mayst have yt, man, yf thow wylt hether resorte, For the Holy Father ys as good a felowe as we. Dissymulacyon The Holy Father! Why, I pray the, whych is he? Privat Welth Usurpid Powre here, which thowgh he apparaunt be In this apparell, yet hathe he autoryte Bothe in hevyn and erth, in purgatory and in hell. Usurpid Powre Marke well his saynges, for a trew tale he doth tell. Sedicyon What, Usurpid Powre? Cockes sowle, ye are owre Pope? Where is yowre thre crounys, yowre crosse keys, and yowre cope? What meanyth this mater? Me thynke ye walke astraye. Usurpid Powre Thow knowest I must have sum dalyaunce and playe, For I am a man lyke as an other ys. Sumtyme I must hunt, sumtyme I must Alysen kys. I am bold of yow, I take ye for no straungers. We are as spirituall; I dowght in yow no daungers. Dissymulacyon I owght to conseder yowre Holy Fatherhode, From my fyrst infancy ye have ben to me so good. For Godes sake wytsave to geve me yowre blyssyng here, Knele. A pena et culpa that I may stand this day clere. Sedicyon From makyng cuckoldes? Mary, that wer no mery chere. Dissymulacyon A pena et culpa: I trow thow canst not here. Sedicyon Yea, with a cuckoldes wyff ye have dronke dobyll bere. Dissymulacyon I pray the, Sedycyon, my pacyens no more stere; A pena et culpa I desyre to be clere, And than all the devylles of hell I wold not fere. Usurpid Powre But tell me one thyng: dost thow not preche the Gospell? Dissymulacyon No, I promyse yow, I defye yt to the devyll of hell! Usurpid Powre Yf I knewe thow dedyst thow shuldest have non absolucyon. Dissymulacyon Yf I do, abjure me or put me to execucyon. Privat Welth I dare say he brekyth no popyshe constytucyon. Usurpid Powre Soche men are worthy to have owre contrybucyon: I assoyle the here, behynde and also beforne. Now art thow as clere as that daye thow wert borne. Ryse, Dyssymulacyon, and stond uppe lyke a bold knyght. Dowght not of my powre thowgh my aparell be lyght. Sedicyon A man, be the messe, can not know yow from a knave; Ye loke so lyke hym as I wold God shuld me save. Privat Welth Thow arte very lewde owre father so to deprave. Thowgh he for his plesure soche lyght apparell have, Yt is now sommer and the heate ys withowt mesure, And among us he may go lyght at his owne plesure. Felow Sedycyon, thowgh thow dost mocke and scoffe, We have other materes than this to be commyned of; Frynd Dyssymulac[y]on, why dost thow not thy massage And show owt of Englond the causse of thi farre passage? Tush, blemysh not, whoreson, for I shall ever assyst the. Sedicyon The knave is whyght-leveryd, by the Holy Trynyte! Usurpid Powre Why so, Privat Welth? What ys the mater? Tell me. Privat Welth Dyssymulac[y]on ys a massanger for the clargy; I must speke for hym, ther ys no remedy. The clargy of Ynglond, which ys yowre specyall frynde, And of a long tyme hath borne yow very good mynde, Fyllyng yowre coffars with many a thowsande pwnde, Yf ye sett not to hand he ys lyke to fall to the grownde. I do promysse yow truly his harte ys in his hose; Kyng Johan so usyth hym that he reconnyth all to lose. Usurpid Powre Tell, Dyssymulac[y]on, why art thow so asshamed To shewe thy massage? Thow art moch to be blamed. Late me se those wrytynges. Tush, man, I pray the cum nere. Dissymulacyon Yowre horryble holynes putth me in wonderfull fere. Usurpid Powre Tush, lett me se them, I pray the hartely. Here Dissimulacyon shall delever the wrytynges to Usurpyd Powre. I perseyve yt well: thow wylt lose no ceremony. Sedicyon Yet is he no lesse than a false knave, veryly. I wold thow haddyst kyst his ars for that is holy. Privat Welth How dost thow prove me that his arse ys holy now? Sedicyon For yt hath an hole evyn fytt for the nose of yow. Privat Welth Yowre parte ys not elles but for to playe the knave, And so ye must styll contynew to yowre grave. Usurpid Powre I saye leve yowre gawdes and attend to me this howre. The bysshoppes writeth here to me, Usurped Powre, Desyryng assystence of myne auctoryte To save and support the Chyrches lyberte. They report Kyng Johan to them to be very harde And to have the Church in no pryce nor regarde. In his parlament he demaundeth of the clargy For his warres the tent of the Chyrches patrymony. Privat Welth Ye wyll not consent to that, I trow, by Saynt Mary! Sedicyon No, drawe to yow styll, but lett none from yow cary. Usurpid Powre Ye know yt is cleane agenst owre holy decrees That princes shuld thus contempne owre lybertees. He taketh uppon hym to reforme the tythes and offrynges, And intermedleth with other spyrytuall thynges. Privat Welth Ye must sequester hym or elles that wyll mare all. Usurpid Powre Naye, besydes all this before juges temporall He conventeth clarkes of cawses crymynall. Privat Welth Yf ye se not to that, the Churche wyll have a fall. Sedicyon By the masse, than pristes are lyke to have a pange; For treson, murder, and thefte they are lyke to hange. By cockes sowle, than I am lyke to walke for treason Yf I be taken. Loke to yt therfor in seasone. Privat Welth Mary, God forbyd that ever yowre holy anoynted For tresone or thefte shuld be hanged, racked or joynted Lyke the rascall sorte of the prophane layete. Usurpid Powre Naye, I shall otherwyse loke to yt, ye may trust me. Before hymselfe also the bysshoppes he doth convent, To the derogacyon of ther dygnyte excelent, And wyll suffer non to the court of Rome to appele. Dissymulacyon No, he contemnyth yowre autoryte and seale, And sayth in his lond he wyll be lord and kyng, No prist so hardy to enterpryse any thyng. For the whych of late with hym ware at veryaunce Fower of his bysshoppes, and in maner at defyaunce: Wyllyum of London, and Eustace, Bysshope of Hely, Water of Wynchester, and Gylys of Hartford, trewly. Be yowre autoryte they have hym excominycate. Usurpid Powre Than have they done well, for he is a reprobate. To that I admytt he ys alwayes contrary. I made this fellow here the Archebysshope of Canterbery, And he wyll agree therto in no condyc[y]on. Privat Welth Than hathe he knowledge that his name ys Sedycyon? Dissymulacyon Dowtles he hath so, and that drownnyth his opynyon. Usurpid Powre Why do ye not saye his name ys Stevyn Langton? Dissymulacyon Tush, we have done so, but that helpyth not the mater: The Bysshope of Norwych for that cawse doth hym flater. Usurpid Powre Styke thow to yt fast, we have onys admytted the. Sedicyon I wyll not one jote from my admyssyon fle: The best of them all shall know that I am he. Naye, in suche maters lett men be ware of me. Usurpid Powre The monkes of Caunterbey ded more at my request Than they wold at his, concernyng that eleccyon. They chase Sedycyon as yt is now manyfest In spytt of his harte. Than he for ther rebellyon Exyled them all, and toke ther hole possessyon Into hys owne handes, them sendyng over see Ther lyvynges to seke in extreme poverte. This custum also he hath, as it is tolde me: Whan prelates depart âyea, bysshope, abbott or curateâ He entreth theyr londes with owt my lyberte, Takyng the profyghtes tyll the nexte be consecrate, Instytute, stallyd, indeucte, or intronyzate. And of the pyed monkes he entendeth to take a dyme. All wyll be marryd yf I loke not to yt in tyme. Dissymulacyon Yt is takyn, ser. The somme ys un-resonnableâ A nynne thowsand marke: to lyve they are not able. His suggesteon was to subdew the Yrysh men. Privat Welth Yea, that same peple doth ease the Church now and then; For that enterpryse they wold be lokyd uppon. Usurpid Powre They gett no mony, but they shall have clene remyssion, For those Yrysh men are ever good to the Church; Whan kynges dysobeye yt than they begynne to worch. Privat Welth And all that they do ys for indulgence and pardon. Sedicyon By the messe, and that is not worth a rottyn wardon. Usurpid Powre What care we for that? To them yt is venyson. Privat Welth Than lett them have yt, a Godes dere benyson! Usurpid Powre Now, how shall we do for this same wycked kyng? Sedicyon Suspend hym and curse hym both with yowre word and wrytyng. Yf that wyll not holpe, than interdyght his land With extrem cruellnes; and yf that wyll not stand Cawse other prynces to revenge the churchys wronge. Yt wyll profytte yow to sett them aworke amonge; For clene remyssyon one kyng wyll subdew another. Yea, the chyld sumtyme wyll sle both father and mother. Usurpid Powre This cownsell ys good; I wyll now folow yt playne. Tary thow styll here tyll we returne agayne. Here go owt Usurpid Powre and Privat Welth and Sedycyon. Usurpyd Powre shall drese for the Pope, Privat Welth for a Cardynall, and Sedycyon for a monke. The Cardynall shall bryng in the crose, and Stevyn Launton the bocke, bell and candell. Dissymulacyon This Usurpid Powre, whych now is gon from hence, For the Holy Church wyll make such ordynance That all men shall be under his obedyens. Yea, kynges wyll be glad to geve hym their alegyance, And than shall we pristes lyve here with owt dysturbans. As Godes owne vyker anon ye shall se hym sytt, His flocke to avaunse by his most polytyke wytt. He shall make prelates, both byshopp and cardynall Doctours and prebendes with furde whodes and syde gownes. He wyll also create the orders monastycall, Monkes, chanons and fryers with gaye coates and shaven crownes, And buylde them places to corrupt cyties and townes. The dead sayntes shall shewe both visyons and myracles With ymages and rellyckes he shall wurke sterracles. He wyll make mattens, houres, masse and evensonge To drowne the scriptures for doubte of heresye; He wyll sende pardons to save mennys sowles amonge, Latyne devocyons with the holye rosarye. He wyll apoynt fastynges and plucke downe matrimonye; Holy water and breade shall dryve awaye the devyll; Blessynges with blacke bedes wyll helpe in every evyll. Kynge Johan of Englande bycause he hath rebelled Agaynst Holy Churche usynge it wurse than a stable, To gyve up hys crowne shall shortly be compelled. And the Albygeanes lyke heretykes detestable, Shall be brent bycause agaynst our father they babble; Through Domynyckes preachynge an eighteen thousande are slayne To teache them how they shall Holy Churche disdayne. All this to performe he wyll cawle a generall cowncell Of all Cristendom to the church of Laternense. His intent shall be for to supprese the Gospell, Yett wyll he glose yt with a very good pretens: To subdwe the Turkes by a Cristen vyolens. Under this coloure he shall grownd ther many thynges, Whych wyll at the last be Cristen mennys undoynges. The Popys powre shall be abowe the powrs all, And eare confessyon a matere nessessary. Ceremonys wyll be the ryghtes ecclesyastycall. He shall sett up ther both pardowns and purgatory; The Gospell prechyng wyll be an heresy. Be this provyssyon, and be soch other kyndes We shall be full suere all waye to have owre myndes. [Usurped Power returns as the Pope, Private Wealth as a Cardinal, and Sedition as Stephen Langton.] The Pope Ah, ye are a blabbe! I perseyve ye wyll tell all. I lefte ye not here to be so lyberall. Knele and knoke on thi bryst. Dissymulacyon Mea culpa, mea culpa, gravissima mea culpa! Geve me yowre blyssyng pro Deo et sancta Maria. The Pope Thow hast my blyssyng. Aryse now and stond asyde. Dissymulacyon My skyn ys so thyke yt wyll not throw glyde. The Pope Late us goo abowght owre other materes now. Say this all thre: We wayte her upon the greate holynes of yow. The Pope For as moch as Kyng Johan doth Holy Church so handle, Here I do curse hym wyth crosse, boke, bell, and candle: Lyke as this same roode turneth now from me his face, So God I requyre to sequester hym of his grace; As this boke doth speare by my worke maanuall, I wyll God to close uppe from hym his benyfyttes all; As this burnyng flame goth from this candle in syght, I wyll God to put hym from his eternall lyght; I take hym from Crist, and after the sownd of this bell Both body and sowle I geve hym to the devyll of hell. I take from hym baptym with the othere sacramentes And suffrages of the Churche, bothe ember dayes and lentes. Here I take from hym bothe penonce and confessyon, Masse of the five wondes, with sensyng and processyon. Here I take from hym holy water and holy brede, And never wyll them to stande hym in any sted. This thyng to publyshe I constytute yow thre, Gevyng yow my powre and my full autoryte. Say this all thre: With the grace of God we shall performe yt, than. The Pope Than gett yow foreward so fast as ever ye can Uppon a bone vyage. Yet late us syng meryly. Sedicyon Than begyne the song, and we shall folow gladly. Here they shall syng. The Pope To coloure this thyng thow shalte be callyd Pandulphus; Thow, Stevyn Langton; thy name shall be Raymundus. Fyrst thow, Pandolphus, shalt opynly hym suspend With boke, bell and candle. Yf he wyll not so amend Interdycte his lande and the churches all up speare. Privat Welth I have my massage: to do yt I wyll not feare. Here go owt and dresse for Nobylyte. The Pope And thow, Stevyn Langton, cummaund the bysshoppes all So many to curse as are to hym benefycyall, Dwkes, erles and lordes, wherby they may forsake hym. Sedicyon Sur, I wyll do yt, and that, I trow, shall shake hym. [Exit.] The Pope Raymundus, go thow forth to the Crysten princes all; Byd them, in my name, that they uppon hym fall, Bothe with fyre and sword, that the Churche may hym conquarre. Dissymulacyon Yowre plesur I wyll no lengar tyme defarre. The Pope Saye this to them also: Pope Innocent the Thred Remyssyon of synnes to so many men hath graunted As wyll do ther best to slee hym yf they may. Dissymulacyon Sur, yt shall be don with owt ony lenger delay. [Exit.] The Pope In the meane season I shall soch gere avaunce As wyll be to us a perpetuall furderaunce: Fyrst eare confessyon, than pardons, than purgatory, Sayntes worchyppyng than, than sekyng of ymagery, Than Laten servyce with the cerymonyes many Wherby owre bysshoppes and abbottes shall get mony. I wyll make a law to burne all herytykes, And kynges to depose whan they are sysmatykes. I wyll all so reyse up the fower beggyng orderes That they may preche lyes in all the Cristen borderes. For this and other I wyll call a generall cownsell To ratyfye them in lyke strength with the Gospell. Here the Pope go owt ... [Enter the Interpreter.] The Interpretour In thys present acte we have to yow declared As in a myrrour the begynnynge of Kynge Johan, How he was of God a magistrate appoynted To the governaunce of thys same noble regyon, To see maynteyned the true faythe and relygyon. But Satan the Devyll, whych that tyme was at large, Had so great a swaye that he coulde it not discharge. Upon a good zele he attempted very farre For welthe of thys realme to provyde reformacyon In the Churche therof, but they ded hym debarre Of that good purpose; for by excommunycacyon The space of seven yeares they interdyct thy nacyon. These bloudsuppers thus of crueltie and spyght Subdued thys good kynge for executynge ryght. In the second acte thys wyll apeare more playne Wherin Pandulphus shall hym excommunycate Within thys hys lande, and depose hym from hys reigne. All other princes they shall move hym to hate And to persecute after most cruel rate. They wyll hym poyson in their malygnyte And cause yll report of hym alwayes to be. Thys noble kynge Johan as a faythfull Moyses Withstode proude Pharao for hys poore Israel, Myndynge to brynge it out of the lande of darkenesse. But the Egyptyanes ded agaynst hym so rebell That hys poore people ded styll in the desart dwell, Tyll that duke Josue whych was our late kynge Henrye Clerely brought us in to the lande of mylke and honye. As a stronge David at the voyce of verytie Great Golye, the Pope, he strake downe with hys slynge Restorynge agayne to a Christen lybertie Hys lande and people, lyke a most vyctoryouse kynge, To hir first bewtye intendynge the churche to brynge From ceremonyes dead to the lyvynge wurde of the Lorde, Thys the seconde acte wyll plenteously recorde.

Say forth yowre mynd in Godes name. Nobylyte I have synnyd agaynst God; I knowlege my selfe to blame. In the sevyn dedly synnys I have offendyd sore; Godes ten commaundymentes I have brokyn ever more; My five boddyly wytes I have ongodly kepte; The workes of charyte in maner I have owtslepte. Sedicyon I trust ye beleve as Holy Chyrch doth teache ye? And from the new lernyng ye are wyllyng for to fle? Nobylyte From the new lernyng? Mary, God of hevyn save me! I never lovyd yt of a chyld, so mote I the. Sedicyon Ye can saye yowre crede? And yowre Laten Ave Mary? Nobylyte Yea, and dyrge also, with sevyn psalmes and letteny. Sedicyon Do ye not beleve in purgatory and holy bred? Nobylyte Yes, and that good prayers shall stand my soule in stede. Sedicyon Well, than, good inowgh; I warant my soulle for yowre. Nobylyte Than execute on me the holy fatheres powre. Sedicyon Naye, whyll I have yow here underneth benedicite, In the Popes be halfe I must move other thynges to ye. Nobylyte In the name of God saye here what ye wyll to me. Sedicyon Ye know that Kyng Johan ys a very wycked man And to Holy Chyrch a contynuall adversary. The Pope wyllyth yow to do the best ye canne To his subduyng for his cruell tyranny; And for that purpose this prevylege gracyously Of clene remyssyon he hath sent yow this tyme Clene to relesse yow of all yowre synne and cryme. Nobylyte Yt is clene agenst the nature of Nobelyte To subdew his kyng with owt Godes autoryte, For his princely astate and powre ys of God. I wold gladly do yt but I fere his ryghtfull rode. Sedicyon Godes holy vycare gave me his whole autoryte. Loo, yt is here, man, beleve yt, I beseche the, Or elles thow wylte faulle in danger of damnacyon. Nobylyte Than I submyt me to the Chyrches reformacyon. Sedicyon I assoyle the here from the kynges obedyence By the auctoryte of the Popys magnifycence: Auctoritate romani pontyficis ego absolvo te From all possessyons gevyn to the spiritualte, In nomine domini pape, amen. Kepe all thynges secrett, I pray yow hartely. Go owt Nobelyte. Nobylyte Yes, that I wyll, sur, and cum agayne hether shortly. Here enter Clargy and Cyvyll Order together; and Sedysyon shall go up and down a praty whyle. Clergye Ys not yowre fatherhod Archebysshope of Canterbery? Sedicyon I am Stevyn Langton. Why make ye here inquyry? Knele and say both: Clergye, Cyvyle Order Ye are ryght welcum to this same regyon, trewly. Sedicyon Stond up, I pray yow. I trow thow art the Clargy, Clergye I am the same, sur, and this is Cyvyle Order. Sedicyon Yf a man myght axe yow what make yow in this bordere? Clergye I herd tell yester daye ye were cum in to the land I thowght for to se yow, sum newes to understand. Sedicyon In fayth, thow art welcum. Ys Cyvyll Order thy frynd? Clergye He is a good man and beryth the chyrch good mynd. Cyvyle Order Ryght sory I am of the great controvarsy Betwyn hym and the kyng, yf I myght yt remedy. Sedicyon Well, Cyvyll Order, for thy good wyll gramercy; That mater wyll be of an other facyon shortly. Fyrst, to begynne with we shall interdyte the land. Cyvyle Order Mary, God forbyde we shuld be in soche band! But who shall do yt, I pray yow hartyly? Sedicyon Pandulphus and I; we have yt in owre legacy. He went to the kyng for that cawse yester daye, And I wyll folow so fast as ever I maye. Lo, here ys the bull of myn auctoryte. Clergye I pray God to save the Popes holy majeste. Sedicyon Sytt downe on yowre kneys and ye shall have absolucyon A pena et culpa, with a thowsand dayes of pardon. Here ys fyrst a bone of the blyssyd Trynyte, A dram of the tord of swete Seynt Barnabe; Here ys a feddere of good Seynt Myhelles wyng, A toth of Seynt Twyde, a pece of Davyds harpe stryng, The good blood of Haylys, and owre blyssyd ladys mylke, A lowse of Seynt Fraunces in this same crymsen sylke, A scabbe of Saynt Job, a nayle of Adams too, A maggott of Moyses, with a fart of Saynt Fandigo; Here is a fygge leafe, and a grape of Noes vyneyearde, A bede of Saynt Blythe with the bracelet of a berewarde, The Devyll that was hatcht in maistre Johan Shornes bote, That the tree of Jesse ded plucke up by the roote; Here ys the lachett of swett Seynt Thomas shewe, A rybbe of Seynt Rabart with the huckyll bone of a Jewe; Here ys a joynt of Darvell Gathyron, Be sydes other bonys and relyckes many one. In nomine domini pape, amen. Aryse now lyke men and stande uppon yowre fete, For here ye have caught an holy and a blyssyd hete. Ye are now as clene as that day ye were borne, And lyke to have increase of chylderne, catell and corne. Cyvyle Order Chyldryn? He can have non, for he ys not of that loade. Sedicyon Tushe, thowgh he hath non at home, he maye have sume abroade. Now Clargy, my frynd, this must thow do for the Pope And for Holy Chyrch; thow must mennys conscyence grope, And as thow felyst them so cause them for to wurcke. Leat them show Kyng Johan no more faver than a Turcke. Every wher sture them to make an insurreccyon. Clergye All that shall I do and to provoke them more, This interdyccyon I wyll lament very sore In all my prechynges, and saye throwgh his occacyon All we are under the danger of dampnacyon; And this wyll move peple to helpe to put hym downe, Or elles compel hym to geve up septur and crowne. Yea, and that wyll make those kynges that shall succede Of the Holy Chyrche to stond ever more in drede. And by sydes all this the chyrch dores I wyll upseale, And closse up the belles that they ryng never a pele. I wyll spere up the chalyce, crysmatory, crosse and all, That masse they shall have non, baptym nor beryall. And thys I know well wyll make the peple madde. Sedicyon Mary, that yt wyll; soche sauce he never had. And what wylte thow do for Holy Chyrche, Cyvyll Ordere? Cyvyle Order For the clargyes sake, I wyll in every border Provoke the gret men to take the commonys parte. With cautyllys of the lawe I wyll so tyckle ther hart They shall thynke all good that they shall passe upon, And so shall we cum to ower full intent anon; For yf the Church thryve than do we lawers thryve, And yf they decay ower welth ys not alyve. Therfor we must helpe yowre state, masters, to uphold, Or elles owre profyttes wyll cache a wynter colde. I never knew lawer whych had ony crafty lernyng That ever escapte yow with owt a plentyows levyng; Therfor we may not leve Holy Churchys quarell, But ever helpe yt, for ther fall ys owre parell. Sedicyon Godes blyssyng have ye! This ger than wyll worke I trust. Cyvyle Order Or elles sum of us are lyke to lye in the dust. Sedicyon Let us all avoyde! Be the messe, the kyng cummyth her! Clergye I wold hyde my selfe for a tyme yf I wyst where. Cyvyle Order Gow we hence apace, for I have spyed a corner. Here go owt all, and Kyng Johan cummyth in. K. Johan For non other cawse God hathe kynges constytute And gevyn them the sword but forto correct all vyce. I have attempted this thyng to execute Uppon transgressers accordyng unto justyce, And be cawse I wyll not be parcyall in myn offyce For theft and murder to persones spirytuall, I have ageynst me the pristes and the bysshoppes all. A lyke dysplesure in my fatheres tyme ded fall Forty yeres ago for ponnyshment of a clarke. No cunsell myght them to reformacyon call, In ther openyon they wer so stordy and starke, But ageynst ther prynce to the Pope they dyd so barke That here in Ynglond, in every cyte and towne Excomminycacyons as thonder boltes cam downe. For this ther captayn had after a pared crowne And dyed upon yt, with owt the kynges consent. Than interdiccyons wer sent from the Popes renowne, Whych never left hym tyll he was penytent And fully agreed unto the Popes apoyntment, In Ynglond to stand with the Chyrches lyberte, And suffer the pristes to Rome for appeles to flee. They bownd hym also to helpe Jerusalem cyte With two hundrid men the space of a yere and more, And thre yere after to maynteyne battell free Ageynst the Sarazens whych vext the Spannyardes sore. Synce my fatheres tyme I have borne them groge therfor, Consydryng the pryde and the capcyose dysdayne That they have to kynges whych owghte over them to rayne. [Privat Welth] cum in lyke a cardynall. Privat Welth God save yow, sur kyng, in yowre pryncly mageste. K. Johan Frynd, ye be welcum. What is yowre plesur with me? Privat Welth From the holy father, Pope Innocent the Thred, As a massanger I am to yow dyrectyd To reforme the peace betwyn Holy Chyrch and yow. And in his behalfe I avertyce yow here now Of the Chyrchys goodes to make full restytucyon, And to accepte also the Popys h[o]ly constytucyon For Stevyn Langton, Archebysshop of Canturbery, And so admytt hym to his state and primacy. The monkes exilyd ye shall restore agayne To ther placys and londes and nothyng of theres retayne. Owre holy fatheres mynde ys that ye shall agayne restore All that ye have ravyshyd from Holy Chyrche with the more. K. Johan I reken yowre father wyll never be so harde But he wyll my cawse as well as theres regarde. I have done nothyng but that I may do well And as for ther taxe I have for me the Gospell. Privat Welth Tushe, Gospell or no ye must make a recompens. K. Johan Yowre father is sharpe and very quycke in sentence Yf he wayeth the word of God nomor than so. But I shall tell yow in this what Y shall do: I am well content to receyve the monkes agayne Upon amendement; but as for Stevyn Langton, playne, He shall not cum here, for I know his dysposycyon. He is moche inclymed to sturdynesse and sedycyon. Ther shall no man rewle in the lond wher I am kyng With owt my consent for no mannys plesur lyvyng. Never the lesse yet upon a newe behaver, At the Popys request here aftere I may hym faver And graunt hym to have sum other benyfyce. Privat Welth By thys I perseyve ye bare hym groge and malyce. Well, thys wyll I say, by cause ye are so blunte: A prelate to dyscharge Holy Chyrche was never wonnt, But her custome ys to mynyster ponnyshment To kynges and princes beyng dyssobedyent. K. Johan Avant, pevysh prist! What, dost thow thretten me? I defye the worst both of thi Pope and the. The powre of princys ys gevyn from God above, And, as sayth Salomon, ther hartes the Lord doth move. God spekyth in ther lyppes whan they geve jugement. The lawys that they make are by the Lordes appoyntment. Christ wylled not his the princes to correcte But to ther precepptes rether to be subjecte. The offyce of yow ys not to bere the sword, But to geve cownsell acordyng to Godes word. He never tawght his to weare nowther sword nor sallett But to preche abrode with owt staffe, scrypp or walett; Yet are ye becum soche myghty lordes this howre That ye are able to subdewe all princes powre. I can not perseyve but ye are becum Belles prystes, Lyvyng by ydolles; yea, the very antychrystes. Privat Welth Ye have sayd yowre mynd, now wyll I say myn also. Here I cursse yow for the wronges that ye have do Unto Holy Churche, with crosse, bocke, bell and candell; And by sydes all thys I must yow otherwyse handell. Of contumacy the Pope hath yow convyt; From this day forward yowre lond stond interdytt. The Bysshope of Norwyche and the Bysshope of Wynchester Hath full autoryte to spred it in Ynglond here; The Bysshope of Salysbery and the Bysshope of Rochester Shall execute yt in Scotlond every where; The Bysshope of Landaffe, Seynt Assys and Seynt Davy In Walles and in Erlond shall puplyshe yt openly. Throwgh owt all Crystyndom the bysshoppes shall suspend All soche as to yow any mayntenance pretend; And I cursse all them that geve to yow ther harte, Dewkes, erlles and lordes, so many as take yowre parte; And I assoyle yowre peple from yowre obedyence, That they shall owe yow noyther fewte nor reverence. By the Popys awctoryte I charge them with yow to fyght As with a tyrant agenst Holy Chyrchys ryght; And by the Popys auctoryte I geve them absolucyon A pena et culpa, and also clene remyssyon. Extra locum: Sedicyon Alarum! Alarum! Tro ro ro ro ro, tro ro ro ro ro, tro ro ro ro ro! Thomp, thomp, thomp! Downe, downe, downe! To go, to go, to go! K. Johan What a noyse is thys that without the dore is made? Privat Welth Suche enmyes are up as wyll your realme invade. K. Johan Ye cowde no nomor and ye cam from the devyll of hell Than ye go abowt here to worke by yo[w]re wyckyd cownsell. Ys this the charyte of that ye call the Churche? God graunt Cristen men not after yowre wayes to worche. I sett not by yowre curssys the shakyng of a rod, For I know they are of the devyll and not of God. Yowre curssys we have that we never yet demaundyd, But we can not have that God hath yow commaundyd. Privat Welth What ye mene by that I wold ye shuld opynlye tell. K. Johan Why, know ye it not? The prechyng of the Gospell. Take to ye yowre traysh, yowre ryngyng, syngyng and pypyng, So that we may have the scryptures openyng. But that we can not have: yt stondyth not with yowre avantage. Privat Welth Ahe! Now I fell yow for this heretycall langage: I thynke noyther yow nor ony of yowres, iwys, We wyll so provyd, shall ware the crowne after this. Go owt and dresse for Nobylyte. K. Johan Yt becum not the Godes secret workes to deme. Gett the hence, or elles we shall teche the to blaspheme! Oh Lord, how wycked ys that same generacyon That never wyll cum to a godly reformacyon. The prystes report me to be a wyckyd tyrant Be cause I correct ther actes and lyfe unplesaunt. Of thy prince, sayth God, thow shalt report non yll, But thy selfe applye his plesur to fulfyll. The byrdes of the ayer shall speke to ther gret shame, As sayth Ecclesyastes, that wyll a prince dyffame. The powrs are of God, I wot Powle hath soch sentence; He that resyst them agenst God maketh resystence. Mary and Joseph, at Cyrinus appoyntment In the descripcyon to Cesar wer obedyent. Crist ded paye trybute for hymselfe and Peter to, For a lawe prescrybyng the same unto pristes also; To prophane princes he obeyed unto dethe. So ded Johan Baptyst so longe as he had brethe. Peter, Johan and Powle, with the other apostles all Ded never withstand the powers imperyall. [Enter Civil Order.] Prystes are so wycked they wyll obeye no powre, But seke to subdewe ther prynces day and howre, As they wold do me: but I shall make them smart Yf that nobelyte and law wyll take my parte. Cyvyle Order Dowghtles we can not tyll ye be reconsylyd Unto Holy Chyrche, for ye are a man defylyd. K. Johan How am I defylyd? Tel me, good gentyll mate. Cyvyle Order By the Popes hye powre ye are excomynycate. K. Johan By the word of God, I pray the, what powre hath he? Cyvyle Order I spake not wyth hym, and therfor I can not tell ye. K. Johan With whom spake ye not? Late me know yowre intent. Cyvyle Order Mary, not with God sens the latter wecke of Lent. [Enter Clergy.] K. Johan Oh mercyfull God, what an unwyse clawse ys this Of hym that shuld se that nothyng ware amys. That sentence or curse that scriptur doth not dyrect In my opynyon shall be of non effecte. Clergye Ys that yowre beleve? Mary God save me from yow! K. Johan Prove yt by scriptur and than wyll I yt alowe. But this know I well: whan Baalam gave the curse Uppon Godes peple they ware never a whyt the worse. Clergye I passe not on the scriptur: that ys inow for me Whyche the Holy Father approvyth by his auctoryte. K. Johan Now alas, alas! What wreched peple ye are And how ygnorant yowre owne wordes doth declare. Woo ys that peple whych hath so wycked techeres. Clergye Naye, wo ys that peple that hathe so cruell rewlars. Owr Holy Father, I trow, cowd do no lesse, Consyderyng the factes of yowre owtragyosnes. [Enter Nobility.] Nobylyte Com awaye, for shame, and make no more a do. Ye are in gret danger for commynnyng with hym so. He is acursyd; I mervell ye do not waye yt. Clergye I here by his wordes that he wyll not obeye yt. Nobylyte Whether he wyll or no, I wyll not with hym talke Tell he be assoyllyd. Com on, my fryndes, wyll ye walke? K. Johan Oh, this is no tokyn of trew nobelyte To flee from yowre kyng in his extremyte. Nobylyte I shall dyssyer yow as now to pardone me; I had moche rather do agaynst God, veryly, Than to Holy Chyrche to do any injurye. K. Johan What blyndnes is this? On this peple, lord, have mercy! Ye speke of defylyng, but ye are corrupted all With pestylent doctryne or leven pharesayycall. Good [and] faythfull Susan sayd that yt was moche bettere To fall in daunger of men than do the gretter, As to leve Godes lawe whych ys his word most pure. Clergye Ye have nothyng, yow, to allege to us but scripture? Ye shall fare the worse for that, ye may be sure. K. Johan What shuld I allege elles, thu wycked Pharyse? To yowre false lernyng no faythfull man wyll agree. Dothe not the Lord say nunc reges intelligiteâ The kynges of the erthe that worldly cawses juge, Seke to the scriptur, late that be yowre refuge? Cyvyle Order Have ye nothyng elles but this? Than God be with ye! K. Johan One questyon more yet ere ye deperte from me I wyll fyrst demaund of yow, Nobelyte: Why leve ye yowre prince and cleave to the Pope so sore? Nobylyte For I toke an othe to defend the Chyrche ever more. K. Johan Clergy, I am sure than yowre quarell ys not small. Clergye I am proffessyd to the ryghtes ecclesyastycall. K. Johan And yow, Cyvyle Order, oweth her sum offyce of dewtye? Cyvyle Order I am hyr feed man; who shuld defend her but I? K. Johan Of all thre partyes yt is spokyn resonably: Ye may not obeye becawse of the othe ye mad, Yowre strong professyon maketh yow of that same trad, Yowre fee provokyth yow to do as thes men do. Grett thynges to cawse men from God to the devyll to go! Yowre othe is growndyd fyrst uppon folyshenes, And yowre professyon uppon moche pevyshenes; Yowre fee, last of all, ryseth owt of covetusnes, And thes are the cawses of yowre rebellyosnes. Clergye Cum, Cyvyll Order, lett us too deperte from hence. K. Johan Than are ye at a poynt for yowre obedyence? Cyvyle Order We wyll in no wysse be partakeres of yowre yll. Here go owt Clargy and dresse for Ynglond, and Syvyll Order for Commynnalte. K. Johan As ye have bene ever so ye wyll contynew styll. Thowgh they be gone, tarye yow with me a whyle; The presence of a prynce to yow shuld never be vyle. Nobylyte Sur, nothyng grevyth me but yowre excomynycacyon. K. Johan That ys but a fantasy in yowre ymagynacyon. The Lord refuse not soch as hath his great cursse, But call them to grace and faver them never the worsse. Saynt Pawle wyllyth yow whan ye are among soch sort Not to abhore them but geve them wordes of confort. Why shuld ye than flee from me, yowre lawfull kyng, For plesur of soch as owght to do no suche thyng? The Chyrches abusyons, as holy Seynt Powle do saye, By the princes powre owght for to be takyn awaye; He baryth not the sword withowt a cawse, sayth he. In this neyther bysshope nore spirituall man is free; Offendyng the lawe, they are under the poweres all. Nobylyte How wyll ye prove me that the fatheres sprytuall Were under the princes ever contynewally? K. Johan By the actes of kynges I wyll prove yt by and by: David and Salomon the pristes ded constitute, Commandyng the offyces that they shuld execute. Josaphat the kyng the mynysters ded appoynt; So ded Kyng Ezechias whom God hym selfe ded anoynt. Dyverse of the princes for the pristes ded make decrees, Lyke as yt is pleyn in the fyrst of Machabees. Owre pristes are rysyn throwgh lyberte of kynges By ryches to pryd and other unlawfull doynges And that is the cawse that they so oft dysobeye. Nobylyte Good Lord, what a craft have yow thes thynges to convaye! K. Johan Now, alas, that the false pretence of superstycyon Shuld cawse yow to be a mayntener of sedycyon! Sum thynkyth nobelyte in natur to consyst, Or in parentage; ther thowght is but a myst. Wher habundance is of vertu, fayth and grace, With knowlage of the Lord nobelyte is ther in place, And not wher as is the wylfull contempte of thynges Pertaynyng to God in the obedyence of kynges. Beware ye synke not with Dathan and Abiron For dysobeyng the powre and domynyon. Nobylyte Nay, byd me be ware I do not synke with yow here; Beyng acurssyd, of trewth ye put me in fere. K. Johan Why, are ye gone hence? And wyll ye no longar tarrye? Nobylyte No, wher as yow are in place, by swete seynt Marye! Here Nobelyte go owt and dresse for the Cardynall. Here enter Ynglond and Commynalte. K. Johan Blessed lorde of heaven, what is the wretchednesse Of thys wycked worlde? An evyll of all evyls doubtlesse. Perceyve ye not here how the clergye hath rejecte Their true allegeaunce to maynteyne the popysh secte? See ye not how lyghte the lawers sett the poure Whome God commaundeth them to obeye yche daye and howre? Nobylyte also whych ought hys prynce to assyste Is vanyshed awaye as it we[re] a wynter myste. All they are from mee; I am now left alone, And, God wote, knowe not to whome to make my mone. Oh, yet wolde I fayne knowe the mynde of my Commynnalte, Whether he wyll go with them or abyde with me. Englande He is here at hond, a symple creatur as may be. K. Johan Cum hether, my frynde, stand nere. Ys thi selfe he? Commynnalte Yf it lyke yowre grace, I am yowre pore Commynnalte. K. Johan Thow art poore inowgh; yf that be good, God help the! Me thynke thow art blynd. Tell me, frynde, canst thow not see? Englande He is blynd in dede, yt is the more rewth and pytte. K. Johan How cummyst thow so blynd? I pray the, good fellow, tell me. Commynnalte For want of knowlage in Christes lyvely veryte. Englande This spirituall blyndnes bryngeth men owt of the waye, And cause them oft tymes ther kynges to dyssobaye. K. Johan How sayst thow, Commynnalte? Wylt not thow take my parte? Commynnalte To that I cowd be contented with all my hart, But alas, in me are two great impedymentes. K. Johan I pray the, shew me what are those impedymentes. Commynnalte The fyrst is blyndnes, wherby I myght take with the Pope Soner than with yow; for, alas, I can but grope, And ye know full well ther are many nowghty gydes. The nexte is poverte, whych cleve so hard to my sydes And ponych me so sore that my powre ys lytyll or non. K. Johan In Godes name, tell me how cummyth thi substance gone? Commynnalte By pristes, channons and monkes, which do but fyll ther bely With my swett and labour for ther popych purgatory. Englande Yowre grace promysed me that I shuld have remedy In that same mater whan I was last here trewly. K. Johan Dowghtles I ded so; but, alas, yt wyll not be. In hart I lament this great infelycyte. Englande Late me have my spowse and my londes at lyberte, And I promyse yow my sonne here, yowre Commynallte I wyll make able to do ye dewtyfull servyce. K. Johan I wold I ware able to do to the that offyce, But, alas, I am not for why my nobelyte, My lawers and clargy hath cowardly forsake me; And now last of all, to my most anguysh of mynd, My Commynnalte here I fynd both poore and blynd. Englande Rest upon this, ser, for my governor ye shall be So long as ye lyve; God hath so apoynted me. His owtward blyndnes ys but a syngnyficac[y]on Of blyndnes in sowle for lacke of informacyon In the word of God, which is the orygynall grownd Of dyssobedyence which all realmies doth confund. Yf yowre grace wold cawse Godes word to be tawght syncerly And subdew those pristes that wyll not preche yt trewly, The peple shuld know to ther prynce ther lawfull dewty; But yf ye permytt contynuance of ypocresye In monke[s], chanons and pristes, and mynysters of the clargy Yowre realme shall never be with owt moch traytery. K. Johan All that I persceyve, and therfor I kepe owt fryers Lest they shuld bryng the moch farder into the bryers. They have mad labur to inhabytt this same regyon; They shall for my tym not enter my domynyon. We have to many of soch vayne lowghtes allredy. I beshrew ther hartes, they have made yow two full nedy. Here enter Pandwlfus the cardynall and sayth: Cardynall What, Commynalte, ys this the covnaunt kepyng? Thow toldyst me thow woldest take hym no more for thi kyng. Commynnalte Peccavi, mea culpa! I submyt me to yowre holynes. Cardynall Gett the hence than shortly and go abowt thi besynes! Wayet on thy capttaynes, Nobelyte and the Clargy, With Cyvyll Order, and the other company. Blow owt yowre tromppettes, and sett forth manfully: The frenche kyng Phelype by sea doth hether apply With the powre of Fraunce to subdew this herytyke. K. Johan I defye both hym and the, lewde scysmatyke! Why wylt thow for sake thi prince or thi prince leve the? Commynnalte I must nedes obbay whan Holy Chirch commandyth me. Go owt Commynulte. Englande Yf thow leve thy kyng take me never for thy mother. Cardynall Tush, care not thow for that, I shall provyd the another. Yt ware fytter for yow to be in another place. Englande Yt shall becum me to wayte upon his grace And do hym servyce where as he ys resydente, For I was gevyn hym of the Lord omnypotente. Cardynall Thow mayst not abyde here, for whye we have hym curssyd. Englande I beshrow yowre hartes so have ye me onpursed. Yf he be acurssed than are we a mete cuppell, For I am interdy[c]t: no salve that sore can suppell. Cardynall I say gett the hence and make me no more pratyng. Englande I wyll not awaye from myn owne lawfull kyng, Appoyntyd of God tyll deth shall us departe. Cardynall Wyll ye not in dede? Well than ye are lyke to smarte. Englande I smarte all redy throw yowre most suttell practyse, And am clene ondone by yowre false merchandyce, Yowre pardons, yowre bulles, yowre purgatory pyckepurse, Yowre lent fastes, yowre schryftes, that I pray God geve yow his cursse! Cardynall Thow shalt smart better or we have done with the, For we have this howre great navyes upon the see In every quarter, with this loller here to fyght And to conquarre hym for the Holy Chyrchis ryght. We have [i]n the northe Alexander, the Kyng of Scottes, With an armye of men that for their townnes cast lottes; On the sowthe syde we have the French kyng with his powre, Which wyll sle and burne tyll he cum to Londen towre; In the west partes we have Kyng Alphonse with the Spanyardes With sheppes full of gonepowder now cummyng hether towardes; And on the est syde we have Esterlynges, Danes, and Norwayes With soch powre landynge as can be resystyd nowayes. K. Johan All that is not true that yow have here expressed. Cardynall By the messe, so true as I have now confessed. K. Johan And what do ye meane by such an hurly burlye? Cardynall For the Churches ryght to subdue ye ma[n]fullye. [Enter Sedition.] Sedicyon To all that wyll fyght I proclame a Jubyle Of cleane remyssyon, thys tyraunt here to slee. Destroye hys people, burne up both cytie and towne, That the Pope of Rome maye have hys scepture and crowne. In the Churches cause to dye thys daye be bolde; Your sowles shall to heaven ere your fleshe and bones be colde. K. Johan Most mercyfull God, as my trust is in the, So conforte me now in this extremyte! As thow holpyst David in his most hevynes So helpe me this houre of thy grace, mercye, and goodnes. Cardynall This owtward remorse that ye show here evydent Ys a grett lykelyhod and token of amendment. How say ye, Kyng Johan? Can ye fynd now in yowre hart To obaye Holy Chyrch and geve ower yowre froward part? K. Johan Were yt so possyble to hold thes enmyes backe, That my swete Ynglond perysh not in this sheppwracke? Cardynall Possyble, quoth he? Yea, they shuld go bake indede, And ther gret armyse to some other quarteres leede, Or elles they have not so many good blyssynges now, But as many cursynges they shall have, I make God avowe. I promyse yow, sur, ye shall have specyall faver Yf ye wyll submyt yowre sylfe to Holye Chyrch here. K. Johan I trust than ye wyll graunt some delyberacyon To have an answere of thys your protestacyon. Sedicyon Tush, gyve upp the crowne and make nomore a do. K. Johan Your spirytuall charyte wyll be better to me than so. The crowne of a realme is a matter of great wayght; In gyvynge it upp we maye not be to slayght. Sedicyon I saye gyve it up! Lete us have nomore a do. Cardynall Yea, and in our warres we wyll no farder go. K. Johan Ye wyll gyve me leave to talke first with my clergye? Sedicyon With them ye nede not; they are at a poynt alreadye. K. Johan Than with my lawers to heare what they wyll tell. Sedicyon Ye shall ever have them as the clergye gyve them counsell. K. Johan Then wyll I commen with my Nobylyte. Sedicyon We have hym so jugled he wyll not to yow agree. K. Johan Yet shall I be content to do as he counsell me. Cardynall Than be not to longe from hence, I wyll advyse ye. [Exeunt King John and England.] Sedicyon Is not thys a sport? By the messe, it is, I trowe. What welthe and pleasure wyll now to our kyngedom growe! Englande is our owne, whych is the most plesaunt grounde In all the rounde worlde! Now maye we realmes confounde. Our Holye Father maye now lyve at hys pleasure, And have habundaunce of wenches, wynes and treasure. He is now able to kepe downe Christe and hys gospell, True fayth to exyle, and all vertues to expell. Now shall we ruffle it in velvattes, golde and sylke, With shaven crownes, syde gownes, and rochettes whyte as mylke. By the messe, Pandulphus, now maye we synge Cantate, And crowe Confitebor, with a joyfull Jubilate! Holde me, or els for laughynge I must burste! Cardynall Holde thy peace, whorson, I wene thu art accurst. Kepe a sadde countenaunce. A very vengeaunce take the! Sedicyon I can not do it, by the messe, and thu shuldest hange me. If Solon were here, I recken that he woulde laugh, Whych never laught yet; yea, lyke a whelpe he woulde waugh. Ha, ha ha! Laugh, quoth he! Yea, laugh and laugh agayne! We had never cause to laugh more free, I am playne. Cardynall I praye the, nomore, for here come the kynge agayne. [King Johan and England return.] Ye are at a poynt wherto ye intende to stande? Sedicyon Yea, hardely sir: gyve up the crowne of Englande. K. Johan I have cast in mynde the great displeasures of warre, The daungers, the losses, the decayes both nere and farre, The burnynge of townes, the throwynge downe of buyldynges, Destructyon of corne and cattell, with other thynges, Defylynge of maydes, and shedynge of Christen blood, With suche lyke outrages, neyther honest, true nor good. These thynges consydered, I am compelled thys houre To resigne up here both crowne and regall poure. Englande For the love of God, yet take some better advysement. Sedicyon Holde your tunge, ye whore, or by the messe ye shall repent! Downe on your mary bones, and make nomore a do. Englande If ye love me, sir, for Gods sake do never so. K. Johan O Englande, Englande, shewe now thyselfe a mother; Thy people wyll els be slayne here without nomber. As God shall judge me I do not thys of cowardnesse, But of compassyon in thys extreme heavynesse. Shall my people shedde their bloude in suche habundaunce? Naye, I shall rather gyve upp my whole governaunce. Sedicyon Come of apace, than, and make an ende of it shortly. Englande The most pytiefull chaunce that hath bene hytherto, surely. K. Johan Here I submyt me to Pope Innocent the Thred, Dyssyering mercy of hys holy fatherhed. Cardynall Geve up the crowne, than; yt shalbe the better for ye. He wyll unto yow the more favorable be. Here the Kyng delevyr the crowne to the Cardynall. K. Johan To hym I resygne here the septer and the crowne Of Ynglond and Yrelond, with the powre and renowne, And put me wholly to his mercyfull ordynance. Cardynall I may say this day the Chyrch hath a full gret chaunce. Thes five dayes I wyll kepe this crowne in myn owne hande, In the Popes behalfe upseasyng Ynglond and Yerlond. In the meane season ye shall make an oblygacyon For yow and yowre ayers in this synyficacyon: To resayve yowre crowne of the Pope for evermore In maner of fefarme; and for a tokyn therfor Ye shall every yere paye hym a thowsand marke With the peter pens, and not agenst yt barke. Ye shall also geve to the Bysshoppe of Cantorbery A thre thowsand marke for his gret injury. To the Chyrch besydes for the great scathe ye have done Forty thowsand marke ye shall devyver sone. K. Johan Ser, the taxe that I had of the hole realme of Ynglond Amownted to no more but unto thirty thowsand. Why shuld I than paye so moche unto the Clargy? Cardynall Ye shall geve yt them; ther is no remedy. K. Johan Shall they paye no tribute yf the realme stond in rerage? Cardynall Sir, they shall paye none; we wyll have no soch bondage. K. Johan The Pope had at once thre hundred thowsand marke. Cardynall What is that to yow? Ah, styll ye wyll be starke. Ye shall paye yt, sur, ther is no remedy. K. Johan Yt shall be performed as ye wyll have yt, trewly. Englande So noble a realme to stande tributarye, alas, To the Devyls vycar! Suche fortune never was. Sedicyon Out with thys harlot! Cockes sowle, she hath lete a fart! Lyke a wretche thu lyest; thy report is lyke as thu art. [Exit Sedition.] Cardynall Ye shall suffer the monkes and channons to make reentry In to ther abbayes, and to dwell ther peacebly. Ye shall se also to my great labur and charge For other thynges elles, we shall commen more at large. K. Johan Ser, in every poynt I shall fulfyll yowre plesur. Cardynall Than plye yt apace, and lett us have the tresur. Englande Alacke for pyte that ever ye grantyd this. For me pore Ynglond ye have done sore amys; Of a fre woman ye have now mad a bonde mayd. Yowre selfe and heyres ye have for ever decayd. Alas, I had rether be underneth the Turke Than under the wynges of soch a thefe to lurke. K. Johan Content the, Ynglond, for ther ys no remedy. Englande Yf yow be plesyd than, I must consent gladly. K. Johan If I shoulde not graunt here woulde be a wondrefull spoyle; Every where the enemyes woulde ruffle and turmoyle. The losse of people stycketh most unto my harte. Englande Do as ye thynke best; yche waye is to my smarte. Cardynall Are ye at a poynt with the same oblygacyon? K. Johan Yt is here redye at yowre interrogacyon. Here Kyng John shall delevyr the oblygacyon. Cardynall Wher is the mony for yowre full restytucyon? K. Johan Here, ser, accordyng to yowre last constytucyon. Cardynall Cum hether, my lorde. By the Popys autoryte Assoyll this man here of irregularyte. Here the bysshop Stevyn Langton cum in. K. Johan Me thynke this bysshope resembleth moch Sedycyon. Cardynall I cownsell yow yet to be ware of wrong suspycyon. This is Stevyn Langton, yowre meteropolytan. K. Johan Than do the offyce of the good Samarytan, And pore oyle and wyne in my old festerd wownd. Releace me of synne that yt doth not me confownd. Confiteor Domino Pape et omnibus cardinalibus eius et vobis, quia peccavi nimis exigendo ab ecclesia tributum, mea culpa. Ideo precor sanctissimum Dominum Papam et omnes prelatos eius et vos, orare pro me. Stevyn Langton Misereatur tui omnipotens Papa, et dimittat tibi omnes erratus tuos, liberetque te a suspencione excominicacione et interdicto, et restituat te in regnum tuum. K. Johan Amen. Stevyn Langton Dominus Papa noster te absolvat, et ego absolvo te auctoritate eius, et apostolorum Petri et Pauli in hac parte mihi comissa, ab omnibus impietatibus tuis, et restituo te corone et regno, in nomine Domini Pape. Amen. Cardynall Ye are well content to take this man for yowre primate? K. Johan Yea, and to use hym accordyng to his estate. I am ryght sory that ever I yow offendyd. Sedicyon And I am full gladde that ye are so welle amended. Unto Holy Churche ye are now an obedyent chylde, Where ye were afore with heresye muche defyelde. Englande Sir, yonder is a clarke whych is condempned for treason, The shryves woulde fayne knowe what to do with hym thys season. [Enter Treason.] K. Johan Come hyther, fellawe. What? Me thynke thu art a pryste. Treason He hath ofter gessed that of the truthe have myste. K. Johan A pryste and a traytour? How maye that wele agree? Treason Yes, yes, wele ynough, underneth Benedicite. Myself hath played it, and therfor I knowe it the better. Amonge craftye cloyners there hath not bene a gretter. K. Johan Tell some of thy feates; thu mayest the better escape. Sedicyon Hem! Not to bolde yet for a mowse the catte wyll gape. Treason Twenty thousande traytour I have made in my tyme Undre Benedicite betwyn hygh masse and pryme. I made Nobylyte to be obedyent To the Churche of Rome, whych most kynges maye repent. I have so convayed that neyther priest nor lawer Wyll obeye Gods wurde, nor yet the Gospell faver. In the place of Christe I have sett up supersticyons; For preachynges, ceremonyes, for Gods wurde, mennys tradicyons. Come to the temple and there Christe hath no place; Moyses and the paganes doth utterly hym deface. Englande Marke wele, sir. Tell what we have of Moyses. Treason All your ceremonyes, your copes and your sensers, doubtlesse, Your fyers, your waters, your oyles, your aulters, your ashes, Your candlestyckes, your cruettes, your salte, with suche lyke trashes; Ye lacke but the bloude of a goate or els a calfe. Englande Lete us heare sumwhat also in the paganes behalfe. Treason Of the paganes ye have your gylded ymages all, In your necessytees upon them for to call With crowchynges, with kyssynges, and settynge up of lyghtes, Bearynge them in processyon and fastynges upon their nyghtes; Some for the tothe ake, some for the pestylence and poxe, With ymages of waxe to brynge moneye to the boxe. Englande What have they of Christe in the Churche? I praye the tell. Treason Marry nothynge at all but the Epystle and the Gospell, And that is in Latyne that no man shoulde it knowe. Sedicyon Peace, noughty whoreson, peace; thu playest the knave, I trowe. K. Johan Hast thu knowne suche wayes, and sought no reformacyon? [Treason] It is the lyvynge of our whole congregacyon. If supersticyons and ceremonyes from us fall, Farwele monke and chanon, priest, fryer, byshopp and all. Our conveyaunce is suche that we have both moneye and ware. Sedicyon Our occupacyon thu wylt marre! God gyve the care. Englande Very fewe of ye wyll Peters offyce take? Treason Yes, the more part of us our maistre hath forsake. Englande I meane for preachynge. I praye God thu be curste. Treason No, no, with Judas we love wele to be purste. We selle our maker so sone as we have hym made, And as for preachynge we meddle not with that trade Least Annas, Cayphas, and the lawers shulde us blame, Callynge us to a reckenynge for preachynge in that name. K. Johan But tell to me, person, whie wert thu cast in preson? [Treason] For no great matter but a lyttle petye treason: For conjurynge, calkynge, and coynynge of newe grotes, For clippynge of nobles with suche lyke pratye motes. Englande Thys is hygh treason and hath bene evermore. K. Johan It is suche treason as he shall sure hange fore. Treason I have holy orders. By the messe, I defye your wurst! Ye can not towche me but ye must be accurst. K. Johan We wyll not towche the, the halter shall do yt alone. Curse the rope therfor whan thu begynnest to grone. Treason And sett ye nomore by the holy ordre of prestehode? Ye wyll prove your selfe an heretyke by the rode. K. Johan Come hyther, Englande, and here what I saye to the. Englande I am all readye to do as ye commaunde me. K. Johan For so much as he hath falsefyed our coyne, As he is worthie lete hym with an halter joyne. Thu shalt hange no priest nor yet none honest man, But a traytour, a thefe, and one that lyttle good can. Cardynall What, yet agaynst the Churche? Gett me boke, belle, and candle; As I am true priest I shall ye yett better handle. Ye neyther regarde hys crowne nor anoynted fyngers, The offyce of a priest, nor the grace that therin lyngers. Sedicyon Sir, pacyent yourselfe and all thynge shall be well. Fygh man! To the Churche that ye shulde be styll a rebell. Englande I accompt hym no priest that worke such haynouse treason. Sedicyon It is a worlde to heare a folysh woman reason. Cardynall After thys maner ye used Peter Pomfrete, A good symple man, and as they saye, a profete. K. Johan Sir, I ded prove hym a very supersticyouse wretche And blasphemouse lyar; therfor ded the lawe hym upstretche. He prophecyed first I shulde reigne but fourteen years, Makynge the people to beleve he coulde bynde bears; And I have reigned a seventene yeares and more. And anon after he grudged at me very sore, And sayde I shulde be exylded out of my realme Before the ascencyon whych was turned to a fantastycall dreame Saynge he would hange if hys prophecye were not true. Thus hys owne decaye hys folyshnesse ded brue. Cardynall Ye shoulde not hange hym whych is a frynde to the Churche. K. Johan Alas, that ye shoulde counte them fryndes of the Churche That agaynst all truthe so hypocritycally lurche; And yll Churche is it that hath suche fryndes in dede. Englande Of Maister Morres suche an other fable we reade, That in Morgans fyelde the sowle of a knyght made verses, Apearynge unto hym and thys one he rehearces: Destruet hoc regnum rex regum duplici plaga, Whych is true as God spake with the Ape at Praga. The sowles departed from thys heavye mortall payne To the handes of God returneth never agayne. A marvelouse thynge that ye thus delyght in lyes! Sedicyon Thys queane doth not els but mocke our blessed storyes. That Peter angred ye whan he called ye a devyll incarnate. K. Johan He is now full sure nomore so uncomely to prate. Well, as for thys man, because that he is a priste I gyve hym to ye; do with hym what ye lyste. Cardynall In the Popes behalfe I wyll sumwhat take upon me. Here I delyver hym by the Churches lyberte In spyght of your hart. Make of it what ye lyste. K. Johan I am pleased, I saye, because he ys pryste. Cardynall Whether ye be or no it shall not greatly force. Lete me see those cheanes. Go thy waye, and have remorce. [The chains are removed.] Treason God save your lordeshypps. I trust I shall amende And do nomore so, or els, sir, God defende. [Exit Treason] Sedicyon I shall make the, I trowe, to kepe thy benefyce. By the Marye Messe, the knave wyll never be wyse. Englande Lyke lorde, lyke chaplayne; neyther barrell, better herynge. Sedicyon Styll she must trattle; that tunge is alwayes sterynge. A wurde or two, sir, I must tell yow in your eare. Cardynall Of some advauntage I woulde very gladly heare. Sedicyon Releace not Englande of the generall interdictyon Tyll the kynge hath graunted the dowrye and the pencyon Of Julyane, the wyfe of Kynge Richarde Cour de Lyon. Ye knowe very well she beareth the Churche good mynde. Tush, we must have all, manne, that she shall leave behynde. As the saynge is he fyndeth that surely bynde. It were but folye suche louce endes for to lose. The lande and the monye wyll make well for our purpose. Tush, laye yokes upon hym, more than he is able to beare; Of Holye Churche so he wyll stande ever in feare. Suche a shrewe as he it is good to kepe undre awe. Englande Woo is that persone whych is undreneth your lawe! Ye maye see, good people, what these same merchauntes are, Their secrete knaveryes, their open factes declare. Sedicyon Holde thy peace, callet, God gyve the sorowe and care! Cardynall Ere I releace yow of the interdyctyon heare In the whych your realme contynued hath thys seven yeare, Ye shall make Julyane your syster in lawe, thys bande, To gyve hir the thirde part of Englande and of Irelande. K. Johan All the worlde knoweth, sir, I owe hir no suche dewtye. Cardynall Ye shall gyve it to hir, there is no remedye. Wyll ye styll withstande our Holy Fathers precepte? Sedicyon In peyne of dampnacyon hys commaundement must be kepte. K. Johan Oh, ye undo me consyderynge my great paymentes. Englande Sir, disconfort not, for God hath sent debatementes; Your mercyfull maker hath shewed upon ye hys powere, From thys heavye yoke delyverynge yow thys howre. The woman is dead; suche newes are hyther brought. K. Johan For me a synnar thys myracle hath God wrought. In most hygh paryls he ever me preserved, And in thys daunger he hath not from me swerved. In genua procumbens Deum adorat, dicens: As David sayth, Lorde, thu dost not leave thy servaunt That wyll trust in the and in thy blessyd covenaunt. Sedicyon A vengeaunce take it! By the messe, it is unhappye She is dead so sone: now is it past remedye. So must we lose all now that she is clerely gone. If that praye had bene ours, oh, it had bene alone! The chaunce beynge suche, by my trouth, even lete it go. No grote, no Pater Noster, no penye, no placebo. The devyll go with it seynge it wyll be no better. Englande Their myndes are all sett upon the fylthie luker. Cardynall Than here I releace yow of your interdictyons all, And strayghtly commaunde yow upon daungers that maye fall Nomore to meddle with the Churches reformacyon, Nor holde men from Rome whan they make appellacyon By God and by all the contentes of thys boke. K. Johan Agaynst Holy Churche I wyll nomore speake nor loke. Sedicyon Go, open the churche dores, and lete the belles be ronge, And through out the realme see that Te Deum be songe. Pryck upp your candels before Saynt Loe and Saynt Legearde, Lete Saynt Atonyes hogge be had in some regarde. If your ale be sower and your breade moulde, certayne, Now wyll they waxe swete, for the Pope hath blest ye agayne. Englande Than within a whyle I trust ye wyll preache the Gospell. Sedicyon That shall I tell the, kepe thu it in secrete counsell: It shall neyther come in churche nor yet in chauncell. Cardynall Goo your wayes a pace and see our pleasure be done. K. Johan As ye have commaunded all shall be perfourmed sone. [Exeunt King John and England.] Cardynall By the messe, I laugh to see thys cleane conveyaunce! He is now full glad as our pype goeth to daunce. By cockes sowle he is now become a good parrysh clarke. Sedicyon Ha, ha, wylye whoreson, dost that so busyly marke? I hope in a whyle we wyll make hym so to rave That he shall become unto us a commen slave And shall do nothynge but as we byd hym do. If we byd hym slea, I trowe he wyll do so; If we bydde hym burne suche as beleve in Christe He shall not saye naye to the byddynge of a priste. But yet it is harde to trust what he wyll be, He is so crabbed, by the Holye Trinyte. To save all thynges up I holde best we make hym more sure And gyve hym a sawce that he no longar endure. Now that I remembre we shall not leave hym thus. Cardynall Whye, what shall we do to hym els, in the name of Jesus? Sedicyon Marry fatche in Lewes, Kynge Phylyppes sonne of Fraunce, To fall upon hym with hys menne and ordynaunce, With wyldefyer, gunpouder, and suche lyke myrye tryckes, To dryve hym to holde and searche hym in the quyckes. I wyll not leave hym tyll I brynge hym to hys yende. Cardynall Well, farwele Sedicyon; do as shall lye in thy myende. [Exit Cardinal.] Sedicyon I marvele greatly where Dissymulacyon is. Dissymulacyon I wyll come anon, if thu tarry tyll I pysse. [Enter Dissimulation.] Sedicyon I beshrewe your hart! Where have ye bene so longe? Dissymulacyon In the gardene, man, the herbes and wedes amonge, And there have I gote the poyson of toade. I hope in a whyle to wurke some feate abroade. Sedicyon I was wonte sumtyme of thy prevye counsell to be, Am I now adayes become a straunger to the? Dissymulacyon I wyll tell the all undreneth Benedicite, What I mynde to do in case thu wylte assoyle me. Sedicyon Thu shalt be assoyled by the most Holy Fathers auctoryte. Dissymulacyon Shall I so in dede? By the masse than now have at the! Benedicite. [Kneels.] Sedicyon In nomine Papae, Amen. Dissymulacyon Sir, thys is my mynde: I wyll gyve Kynge Johan thys poyson, So makynge hym sure that he shall never have foyson. And thys must thu saye to colour with the thynge That a penye lofe he wolde have brought to a shyllynge. Sedicyon Naye, that is suche a lye as easely wyll be felte. Dissymulacyon Tush, man, amonge fooles it never wyll be out smelte, Though it be a great lye. Set upon it a good face, And that wyll cause men beleve it in every place. Sedicyon I am sure than thu wylt geve it hym in a drynke. Dissymulacyon Marry, that I wyll, and the one half with hym swynke To encourage hym to drynke the botome off. Sedicyon If thu drynke the halfe thu shalt fynde it no scoff; Of terryble deathe thu wyllt stacker in the plashes. Dissymulacyon Tush, though I dye, man, there wyll ryse more of my ashes. I am sure the monkes wyll praye for me so bytterlye That I shall not come in helle nor in purgatorye. In the Popes kychyne the scullyons shall not brawle Nor fyght for my grese. If the priestes woulde for me yewle And grunt a good pace placebo with Requiem Masse, Without muche tarryaunce I shulde to paradyse passe Where I myght be sure to make good cheare and be myrye For I can not awaye with that whoreson purgatorye. Sedicyon To kepe the from thens thu shalt have fyve monkes syngynge In Swynsett abbeye so longe as the worlde is durynge; They wyll daylye praye for the sowle of Father Symon, A Cisteane monke whych poysened Kynge John. Dissymulacyon Whan the worlde is done what helpe shall I have than? Sedicyon Than shyft for thy self so wele as ever thu can. Dissymulacyon Cockes sowle, he cometh here! Assoyle me that I were gone then. Sedicyon Ego absolvo te, in nomine Papae, Amen. [Exeunt Sedition and Dissimulation. Enter King John and England.] K. Johan No prynce in the worlde in suche captivyte As I am thys houre, and all for ryghteousnesse. Agaynst me I have both the lordes and commynalte, Byshoppes and lawers, whych in their cruell madnesse Hath brought in hyther the Frenche kynges eldest sone, Lewes. The chaunce unto me is not so dolourrouse, But my lyfe thys daye is muche more tedyouse. More of compassyon for shedynge of Christen blood Than any thynge els my sceptre I gave up latelye To the Pope of Rome whych hath no tytle good Of jurisdyctyon but of usurpacyon onlye. And now to the, Lorde, I woulde resygne up gladlye Both my crowne and lyfe, for thyne owne ryght it is If it woulde please the to take my sowle to thy blys. Englande Sir, discomfort ye not in the honour of Christe Jesu: God wyll never fayle yow, intendynge not els but vertu. K. Johan The anguysh of sprete so pangeth me every where That incessauntly I thyrst tyll I be there. Englande Sir, be of good chere, for the Pope hath sent a legate Whose name is Gualo, your foes to excommunycate. Not only Lewes, whych hath wonne Rochestre, Wynsore and London, Readynge and Wynchestre, But so manye els as agaynst ye have rebelled He hath suspended and openly accursed. K. Johan They are all false knaves; all men of them be ware. They never left me tyll they had me in their snare. Now have they Otto, the Emproure, so wele as me And the French kynge, Phylypp, undre their captivyte. All Christen princes they wyll have in their bandes. The Pope and hys priestes are poyseners of all landes. All Christen people be ware of trayterouse pristes For of truthe they are the pernicyouse Antichristes. Englande Thys same Gualo, sir, in your cause doth stoughtly barke. K. Johan They are all nought, Englande, so many as weare that marke. From thys habytacyon, swete lorde, delyver me, And preserve thys realme, of thy benygnyte. Dissymulacyon [sings offstage.] Wassayle, wassayle, out of the mylke payle, Wassayle, wassayle, as whyte as my nayle, Wassayle, wassayle, in snowe, froste, and hayle, Wassayle, wassayle, with partriche and rayle. Wassayle, wassayle, that muche doth avayle, Wassayle, wassayle, that never wyll fayle. K. Johan Who is that, Englande? I praye the, stepp fourth and see. Englande He doth seme a farre some relygyouse man to be. [Enter Dissimulation disguised as a monk.] Dissymulacyon Now Jesus preserve your worthye and excellent grace, For doubtlesse there is a very angelyck face. Now forsoth and God, I woulde thynke my self in heaven If I myght remayne with yow but yeares alevyn; I woulde covete here none other felicyte. K. Johan A lovynge persone thu mayest seme for to be. Dissymulacyon I am as gentle a worme as ever ye see. K. Johan But what is thy name, good frynde? I praye the tell me. Dissymulacyon Simon of Swynsett my very name is, per Dee. I am taken of men for monastycall devocyon, And here have I brought yow a marvelouse good pocyon For I hearde ye saye that ye were very drye. K. Johan In dede I wolde gladly drynke. I praye the, come nye. Dissymulacyon The dayes of your lyfe never felt ye suche a cuppe, So good and so holsome if ye woulde drynke it upp. It passeth malmesaye, capryck, tyre or ypocras. By my faythe, I thynke a better drynke never was. K. Johan Begynne, gentle monke; I praye the, drynke half to me. Dissymulacyon If ye dronke all up it were the better for ye. It woulde slake your thirst and also quycken your brayne. A better drynke is not in Portyngale nor Spayne. Therfor suppe it of and make an ende of it quycklye. K. Johan Naye, thu shalte drynke half. There is no remedye. Dissymulacyon Good lucke to ye than; have at it by and bye. Halfe wyll I consume if there be no remedye. K. Johan God saynt the, good monke, with all my very harte. Dissymulacyon I have brought ye half; conveye me that for your parte. Where art thu, Sedicyon? By the masse, I dye, I dye. Helpe now at a pynche. Alas, man, cum awaye shortlye! [Enter Sedition.] Sedicyon Come hyther apace and gett thee to the farmerye. I have provyded for the, by swete Saynt Powle. Fyve monkes that shall synge contynually for thy sowle. That, I warande the, thu shalt not come in helle. Dissymulacyon To sende me to heaven goo rynge the holye belle And synge for my sowle a masse of Scala Celi, That I maye clyme up aloft with Enoch and Heli. I do not doubte it but I shall be a saynt; Provyde a gyldar myne image for to paynt. I dye for the Churche with Thomas of Canterberye. Ye shall fast my vigyll and upon my daye be merye. No doubt but I shall do myracles in a whyle, And therfor lete me be shryned in the north yle. Sedicyon To the than wyll offer both crypple, halte and blynde, Mad men and mesels, with suche as are woo behynde. Exeunt. K. Johan My bodye me vexeth; I doubt muche of a tympanye. Englande Now alas, alas, your grace is betrayed cowardlye! K. Johan Where became the monke that was here with me latelye? Englande He is poysened, sir, and lyeth a dyenge surelye. K. Johan It can not be so, for he was here even now. Englande Doubtlesse, sir, it is so true as I have tolde yow. A false Judas kysse he hath gyven yow and is gone. The halte, sore and lame thys pitiefull case wyll mone. Never prynce was there that made to poore peoples uses So many masendewes, hospytals, and spyttle howses As your grace hath done yet sens the worlde began. K. Johan Of priestes and of monkes I am counted a wycked man For that I never buylte churche nor monasterye, But my pleasure was to helpe suche as were nedye. Englande The more grace was yours for at the daye of judgement Christe wyll rewarde them whych hath done hys commaundement. There is no promyse for voluntarye wurkes Nomore than there is for sacrifyce of the Turkes. K. Johan Doubtlesse I do fele muche grevaunce in my bodye. Englande As the Lorde wele knoweth for that I am full sorye. K. Johan There is no malyce to the malyce of the clergye. Well, the Lorde God of heaven on me and them have mercye. For doynge justyce they have ever hated me. They caused my lande to be excommunycate And me to resygne both crowne and princely dygnyte, From my obedyence assoylynge every estate, And now, last of all, they have me intoxycate. I perceyve ryght wele their malyce hath none ende. I desyre not els but that they maye sone amende. I have sore hungred and thirsted ryghteousnesse For the offyce sake that God hath me appoynted; But now I perceyve that synne and wyckednesse In thys wretched wordle, lyke as Christe prophecyed, Have the overhande; in me is it verefyed. Praye for me, good people, I besych yow hartely, That the Lorde above on my poore sowle have mercy. Farwell, noble men, with the clergye spirytuall; Farwell, men of lawe, with the whole commynnalte. Your disobedyence I do forgyve yow all And desyre God to perdon your iniquyte. Farwell, swete Englande, now last of all to the; I am ryght sorye I coulde do for the nomore. Farwele ones agayne, yea, farwell for evermore. Englande With the leave of God I wyll not leave ye thus, But styll be with ye tyll he do take yow from us, And than wyll I kepe your bodye for a memoryall. K. Johan Than plye it Englande, and provyde for my buryall. A wydowes offyce it is to burye the deade. [Dies.] Englande Alas, swete maistre, ye waye so heavy as leade. Oh horryble case that ever so noble a kynge Shoulde thus be destroyed and lost for ryghteouse doynge By a cruell sort of disguysed bloud souppers, Unmercyfull murtherers all dronke in the bloude of marters. Report what they wyll in their most furyouse madnesse, Of thys noble kynge muche was the godlynesse. Exeunt. [Enter Verity.] Veritas I assure ye, fryndes, lete men wryte that they wyll Kynge Johan was a man both valeaunt and godlye. What though Polydorus reporteth hym very yll At the suggestyons of the malicyouse clergye? Thynke yow a Romane with the Romanes can not lye? Yes! Therfor Leylande out of thy [slumbre] awake And wytnesse a trewthe for thyne owne contrayes sake. For hys valeauntnesse many excellent writers make, As Sigebertus, Vincentius and also Nauclerus; Giraldus and Mathu Parys with hys noble vertues takeâ Yea, Paulus Phrigio, Johan Major and Hector Boethius. Nothynge is allowed in hys lyfe of Polydorus Whych discommendeth hys ponnyshmentes for trayterye, Advauncynge very sore hygh treason in the clergye. Of hys godlynesse thus muche report wyll I: Gracyouse provysyon for sore, sycke, halte and lame He made in hys tyme he made both in towne and cytie Grauntynge great lyberties for mayntenaunce of the same By markettes and fayers in places of notable name. Great monymentes are in Yppeswych, Donwych and Berye, Whych noteth hym to be a man of notable mercye. The cytie of London through hys mere graunt and premye Was first privyleged to have both mayer and shryve, Where before hys tyme it had but baylyves onlye. In hys dayes the brydge the cytiezens ded contryve. [Enter Nobility, Clergy, and Civil Order.] Though he now be dead, hys noble actes are alyve. Hys zele is declared as towchynge Christes religyon In that he exyled the Jewes out of thys regyon. Nobylyte Whome speake ye of, sir, I besyche ye hartelye? Veritas I talke of Kynge Johan, of late your prynce most worthye. Nobylyte Sir, he was a man of a very wycked sorte. Veritas Ye are much to blame your prynce so to reporte. How can ye presume to be called Nobilyte Diffamynge a prynce in your malygnyte? Ecclesiastes sayth, If thu with an hatefull harte Misnamest a kynge thu playest suche a wycked parte As byrdes of ayer to God wyll represent To thy great parell and excedynge ponnyshment. Saynt Hierome sayth also that he is of no renowne But a vyle traytour that rebelleth agaynst the crowne. Clergye He speaketh not agaynst the crowne but the man, per dee. Veritas Oh, where is the sprete whych ought to reigne in the! The crowne of it selfe without the man is nothynge. Learne of the scriptures to have better undrestandynge. The harte of a kynge is in the handes of the Lorde, And he directeth it, wyse Salomon to recorde. They are abhomynable that use hym wyckedlye. Clergye He was never good to us, the sanctifyed clergye. Veritas Wyll ye knowe the cause before thys worshypfull cumpanye? Your conversacyon and lyves are very ungodlye. Kynge Salomon sayth, Who hath a pure mynde, Therin delyghtynge shall have a kynge to frynde. On thys wurde Cleros, whych signyfieth a lott Or a sortynge out into a most godly knott, Ye do take your name for that ye are the lordes Select of hys wurde to be the specyall recordes, As of Saynt Mathias we have a syngular mencyon That they chose hym out anon after Christes ascencyon. Thus do ye recken. But I feare ye come of Clerus A very noyfull worme, as Aristotle sheweth us, By whome are destroyed the honycombes of bees; For poore wydowes ye robbe as ded the Pharysees. Cyvyle Order I promyse yow it is uncharytably spoken. Veritas Treuthe ingendereth hate; ye shewe therof a token. Ye are suche a man as ought every where to see A godly order, but ye loose yche mare commynalte. Plato thought alwayes that no hyghar love coulde be Than a man to peyne hymself, for hys own countreye. David for their sake the proude Phelistyan slewe, Aioth mad Eglon hys wyckednesse to rewe, Esdras from Persye for hys owne contreys sake Came to Hierusalem their stronge holdes up to make; But yow, lyke wretches, cast over both contreye and kynge. All manhode shameth to see your unnaturall doynge. Ye wycked rulers, God doth abhorre ye all. As Mantuan reporteth in hys Egloges Pastorall Ye fede not the shepe, but ever ye pylle the flocke And clyppe them so nygh that scarsely ye leave one locke. Your jugementes are suche that ye call to God in vayne So longe as ye have your prynces in disdayne. Chrysostome reporteth that nobylyte of fryndes Avayleth nothynge except ye have godly myndes. What profiteth it yow to be called spirytuall Whyls yow for lucre from all good vertues fall? What prayse is it to yow to be called Cyvylyte If yow from obedyence and godly order flee? Anneus Seneca hath thys most provable sentence: The gentyll free hart goeth never from obedyence. Cyvyle Order Sir, my bretherne and I woulde gladly knowe your name. Veritas I am Veritas that come hyther yow to blame For castynge awaye of our most lawfull kynge. Both God and the worlde detesteth your dampnable doynge. How have ye used Kynge Johan here now of late I shame to rehearce the corruptyons of your state. Ye were never wele tyll ye had hym cruelly slayne, And now, beynge dead ye have hym styll in disdayne. Ye have raysed up of hym most shamelesse lyes Both by your reportes and by your written storyes. He that slewe Saul through fearcenesse vyolent Was slayne sone after at Davids just commaundement For bycause that Saul was anoynted of the Lorde. The Seconde of Kynges of thys beareth plenteouse recorde. He was in those dayes estemed wurthie to dye On a noynted kynge that layed handes violentlye. Ye are not ashamed to fynde fyve priestes to synge For that same traytour that slewe your naturall kynge. A trayterouse knave ye can set upp for a saynte, And a ryghteouse kynge lyke an hatefull tyraunt paynte. I coulde shewe the place where yow most spyghtfullye Put out your torches upon hys physnomye. In your glasse wyndowes ye whyppe your naturall kynges. As I sayde afore, I abhorre to shewe your doynges. The Turkes I dare saye are a thousande tymes better than yow. Nobylyte For Gods love, nomore! Alas, ye have sayde ynough. Clergye All the worlde doth knowe that we have done sore amys. Cyvyle Order Forgyve it us so that we never heare more of thys. Veritas But are ye sorye for thys ungodly wurke? Nobylyte I praye to God, els I be dampned lyke a Turke. Veritas And make true promyse ye wyll never more do so? Clergye Sir, never more shall I from true obedyence goo. Veritas What saye yow, brother? I must have also your sentence. Cyvyle Order I wyll ever gyve to my prynce due reverence. Veritas Well, than, I doubt not but the Lorde wyll condescende To forgyve yow all, so that ye mynde to amende. Adewe to ye all, for now I must be gone. [Enter Imperial Majesty.] Imperyall Majestye Abyde, Veryte; ye shall not depart so sone. Have ye done all thynges as we commaunded yow? Veritas Yea, most gracyouse prynce, I concluded the whole even now. Imperyall Majestye And how do they lyke the customs they have used With our predecessours, whome they have so abused, Specyally Kynge Johan? Thynke they they have done well? Veritas They repent that ever they folowed sedicyouse counsell And have made promes they wyll amende all faultes. Imperyall Majestye And forsake the Pope with all hys cruell assaultes? Veritas Whie do ye not bowe to Imperyall Majeste? Knele and axe pardon for your great enormyte. [Nobility, Clergy, and Civil Order kneel.] Nobylyte Most godly governour, we axe your gracyouse pardon, Promysynge nevermore to maynteyne false Sedicyon. Clergye Neyther Pryvate Welthe nor yet Usurped Poure Shall cause me disobeye my prynce from thys same houre. False Dissymulacyon shall never me begyle; Where I shall mete hym I wyll ever hym revyle. Imperyall Majestye I perceyve, Veryte, ye have done wele your part Refourmynge these men. Gramercyes with all my hart! I praye yow, take paynes to call our Commynalte To true obedyence as ye are Gods Veryte. Veritas I wyll do it, sir. Yet shall I have muche a doo With your Popish prelates. They wyll hunte me to and fro. Imperyall Majestye So longe as I lyve they shall do yow no wronge. Veritas Than wyll I go preache Gods wurde your commens amonge. But first I desyre yow their stubberne factes to remytt. Imperyall Majestye I forgyve yow all and perdon your frowarde wytt. Omnes Una The heavenly governour rewarde your goodnesse for it. Veritas For Gods sake obeye lyke as doth yow befall, For in hys owne realme a kynge is judge over all By Gods appoyntment, and none maye hym judge agayne But the Lorde hymself. In thys the scripture is playne. He that condempneth a kynge condempneth God without dought He that harmeth a kynge to harme God goeth abought; He that a prynce resisteth doth dampne Gods ordynaunce And resisteth God in withdrawynge hys affyaunce. All subjectes offendynge are undre the kynges judgement: A kynge is reserved to the Lorde Omnypotent. He is a mynyster immedyate undre God, Of hys ryghteousnesse to execute the rod. I charge yow therfor as God hath charge me To gyve to your kynge hys due supremyte And exyle the Pope thys realme for evermore. Omnes Una We shall gladly doo accordynge to your loore. Veritas Your grace is content I shewe your people the same? Imperyall Majestye Yea, gentle Veryte, shewe them their dewtye in Gods Name. [Exit Verity.] To confyrme the tale that Veryte had now The Seconde of Kynges is evydent to yow. The yonge man that brought the crowne and bracelett Of Saul to David, saynge that he had hym slayne David commaunded as though he had done that forfett Strayght waye to be slayne. Gods sprete ded hym constrayne To shewe what it is a kynges bloude to distayne. So ded he those two that in the fyelde hym mett And unto hym brought the heade of Isboset. Consydre that Christe was undre the obedyence Of worldly prynces so longe as he was here, And alwayes used them with a lowly reverence Paynge them tribute, all hys true servauntes to stere To obeye them, love them, and have them in reverent feare. Dampnacyon it is to hym that an ordre breake Appoynted of God, lyke as the Apostle speake. No man is exempt from thys Gods ordynaunceâ Bishopp, monke, chanon, priest, cardynall, nor pope. All they by Gods lawe to kynges owe their allegeaunce. Thys wyll be wele knowne in thys same realme, I hope. Of Verytees wurdes the syncere meanynge I grope; He sayth that a kynge is of God immedyatlye. Than shall never pope rule more in thys monarchie. Clergye If it be your pleasure we wyll exyle hym cleane, That he in thys realme shall nevermore be seane, And your grace shall be the supreme head of the Churche. To brynge thys to passe ye shall see how we wyll wurche. Imperyall Majestye Here is a nyce tale! He sayth, if it be my pleasure He wyll do thys acte to the Popes most hygh displeasure, As who sayth, I woulde for pleasure of my persone And not for Gods truthe have suche an enterpryse done. Full wysely convayed! The crowe wyll not chaunge her hewe. It is marvele to me and ever ye be trewe. I wyll the auctoryte of Gods holy wurde to do it And it not to aryse of your vayne slypper wytt. That scripture doth not is but a lyght fantasye. Clergye Both Daniel and Paule calleth hym Gods adversarye, And therfor ye ought as a devyll hym to expell. Imperyall Majestye Knewe ye thys afore and woulde it never tell? Ye shoulde repent it had we not now forgyven ye. Nobylyte, what saye yow? Wyll ye to thys agree? Nobylyte I can no lesse, sir, for he is wurse than the Turke. Whych none other wayes but by tyrannye doth wurke. Thys bloudy bocher with hys pernycyouse bayte Oppresse Christen princes by frawde, crafte and dissayte, Tyll he compell them to kysse hys pestylent fete Lyke a levyathan syttynge in Moyses sete. I thynke we can do unto God no sacrifyce That is more accept nor more agreynge to justyce Than to slea that beaste and slauterman of the devyll, That Babylon boore whych hath done so muche evyll. Imperyall Majestye It is a clere sygne of a true nobilyte To the wurde of God whan your conscyence doth agree. For as Christe ded saye to Peter, Caro et sanguis Non revelavit tibi, sed Pater meus celestis: Ye have not thys gyfte of carnall generac[y]on, Nor of noble bloude, but by Gods owne demonstracyon. Of yow, Cyvyle Order, one sentence woulde I heare. Cyvyle Order I rewe it that ever any harte I ded hym beare. I thynke he hath spronge out of the bottomlesse pytt And in mennys conscyence in the stede of God doth sytt, Blowynge fourth a swarme of grassopers and flyes Monkes, fryers and priestes, that all truthe putrifyes. Of the Christen faythe playe now the true defendar; Exyle thys monster and ravenouse devourar With hys venym wormes, hys adders, whelpes and snakes, Hys cuculled vermyne that unto all myschiefe wakes. Imperyall Majestye Than in thys purpose ye are all of one mynde? Clergye We detest the Pope and abhorre hym to the fynde. Imperyall Majestye And are wele content to disobeye hys pryde? Nobylyte Yea, and hys lowsye lawes and decrees to sett asyde. Imperyall Majestye Than must ye be sworne to take me for your heade. Cyvyle Order We wyll obeye yow as our governour in Gods steade. Imperyall Majestye Now that ye are sworne unto me your pryncypall I charge ye to regarde the wurde of God over all And in that alone to rule, to speake, and to judge, As ye wyll have me your socour and refuge. Clergye If ye wyll make sure ye must exyle Sedicyon, False Dyssymulacyon, with all vayne superstycyon, And put Private Welthe out of the monasteryes; Than Usurped Power maye goo a birdynge for flyes. Imperyall Majestye Take yow it in hande and do your true dilygence, Iche man for hys part; ye shall wante no assystence. Clergye I promyse yow here to exyle Usurped Powre And your supremyte to defende yche daye and howre. Nobylyte I promyse also out of the monasteryes To put Private Welthe and detect hys mysteryes. Cyvyle Order False Dissymulacyon I wyll hange up in Smythfylde With suche supersticon as your people hath begylde. Imperyall Majestye Than I trust we are at a very good conclusyon Vertu to have place and vyce to have confusyon. Take Veryte wyth ye for every acte ye doo; So shall ye be sure not out of the waye to goo. Sedicyon intrat. [He is singing.] Pepe I see ye! I am glad I have spyed ye. Nobylyte There is Sedicyon. Stande yow asyde a whyle; Ye shall see how we shall catche hym by a wyle. Sedicyon No noyse amonge ye? Where is the mery chere That was wont to be with quassynge of double bere? The worlde is not yet as some men woulde it have. I have bene abroade and I thynke I have playde the knave. Cyvyle Order Thu canyst do none other except thu change thy wunte. Sedicyon What myschiefe ayle ye that ye are to me so blunte? I have sene the daye ye have favoured me, Perfectyon. Clergye Thy selfe is not he; thu art of an other complectyon. Sir, thys is the thiefe that first subdued Kynge John, Vexynge other prynces that sens have ruled thys regyon; And now he doth prate he hath so played the knave That the worlde is not yet as some men woulde it have. It woulde be knowne, sir, what he hath done of late. Imperyall Majestye What is thy name, frynde? To us here intymate. Sedicyon A sayntwary! A sayntwary! For Gods dere passyon, a sayntwarye. Is there none wyll holde me and I have made so manye? Imperyall Majestye Tell me what thy name is; thu playest the knave I trowe. Sedicyon I am wyndelesse, good man; I have muche peyne to blowe. Imperyall Majestye I saye tell thy name or the racke shall the constrayne. Sedicyon Holy Perfectyon my godmother called me playne. Nobylyte It is Sedicyon. God gyve hym a very myschiefe! Cyvyle Order Undre heaven is not a more detestable thiefe. Sedicyon By the messe, ye lye. I see wele ye do not knowe me. Imperyall Majestye Ah, brother, art thu come? I am ryght glad we have the. Sedicyon By bodye, bloude, bones, and sowle I am not he. Clergye If swearynge myghte helpe he woulde do we[le] ynough. Imperyall Majestye He scape not our handes so lyghtly, I waraunde yow. Clergye Thys is that thiefe, sir, that all Christendome hath troubled And the Pope of Rome agaynst all kynges maynteyned. Nobylyte Now that ye have hym nomore but hange hym uppe. Cyvyle Order If ye so be content it shall be done ere I suppe. Imperyall Majestye Loo, the Clergye accuseth the; Nobylyte condempneth the; And the lawe wyll hange the. What sayst now to me? Sedicyon I woulde I were now at Rome, at the sygne of the cuppe, For heavynesse is drye. Alas, must I nedes clymbe uppe? Perdon my lyfe and I shall tell ye all, Both that is past and that wyll herafter fall. Imperyall Majestye Aryse. I perdon the so that thu tell the trewthe. Sedicyon I wyll tell to yow suche treason as ensewthe; Yet a ghostly father ought not to bewraye confessyon. Imperyall Majestye No confessyon is but ought to discover treason. Sedicyon I thynke it maye kepe all thynge save heresye. Imperyall Majestye It maye holde no treason I tell the verelye, And therfor tell the whole matter by and bye. Thu saydest now of late that thu haddest played the knave And that the worlde was not as some men woulde it have. Sedicyon I coulde playe Pasquyll but I feare to have rebuke. Imperyall Majestye For utterynge the truthe feare neyther byshopp nor duke. Sedicyon Ye gave injunctyons that Gods wurde myghte be taught, But who observe them? Full manye a tyme have I laught To see the conveyaunce that prelates and priestes can fynde. Imperyall Majestye And whie do they beare Gods wurde no better mynde? Sedicyon For if that were knowne than woulde the people regarde No heade but their prynce; with the Churche than were it harde. Than shoulde I lacke helpe to maynteyne their estate, As I attempted in the Northe but now of late. And sens that same tyme in other places besyde Tyll my setters on were of their purpose wyde. A vengeaunce take it! It was never well with me Sens the cummynge hyther of that same Veryte. Yet do the byshoppes for my sake vexe hym amonge. Imperyall Majestye Do they so in dede? Well, they shall not do so longe. Sedicyon In your parlement commaunde yow what ye wyll, The Popes ceremonyes shall drowne the the Gospell styll. Some of the byshoppes at your injunctyons slepe, Some laugh and go bye and some can playe boo pepe; Some of them do nought but searche for heretykes Whyls their priestes abroade do playe the scysmatykes. Tell me in London how manye their othes discharge Of the curates there? Yet is it muche wurse at large. If your true subjectes impugne their trecheryes They can fatche them in anon for sacramentaryes Or Anabaptystes; thus fynde they a subtyle shyfte To proppe up their kyngedome suche is their wyly dryfte. Get they false wytnesses they force not of whens they be, Be they of Newgate or be they of the Marshall-see. Paraventure a thousande are in one byshoppes boke And agaynst a daye are readye to the hooke. Imperyall Majestye Are those matters true that thu hast spoken here? Sedicyon What can in the worlde more evydent wytnesse bere? First of all consydre the prelates do not preache But persecute those that the Holye Scriptures teache; And marke me thys wele they never ponnysh for popery But the Gospell readers they handle very coursely, For on them they laye by hondred poundes of yron And wyll suffer none with them ones for to common. Sytt they never so longe nothynge by them cometh fourthe To the truthes furtheraunce that any thynge ys wourthe. In some byshoppes howse ye shall not fynde a testament, But yche man readye to devoure the innocent. We lyngar a tyme and loke but for a daye To sett upp the Pope if the Gospell woulde decaye. Clergye Of that he hath tolde hys selfe is the very grounde. Imperyall Majestye Art thu of counsell in thys that that thu hast spoken? Sedicyon Yea, and in more than that if all secretes myght be broken; For the Pope I make so muche as ever I maye do. Imperyall Majestye I praye the hartely, tell me why thu doest so. Sedicyon For I perceyve wele the Pope is a jolye fellawe, A trymme fellawe, a ryche fellawe, yea, and myry fellawe. Imperyall Majestye A jolye fellawe how dost thu prove the Pope? Sedicyon For he hath crosse keyes with a tryple crowne and a cope, Trymme as a trencher, havynge hys shoes of golde, Ryche in hys ryalte and angelyck to beholde. Imperyall Majestye How dost thu prove hym to be a fellawe myrye? Sedicyon He hath pypes and belles, with kyrye, kyrye, kyrye. Of hym ye maye bye both salt, creame, oyle and waxe. And after hygh masse ye maye learne to beare the paxe. Imperyall Majestye Yea, and nothynge heare of the Pystle and the Gospell? Sedicyon No, sir, by the masse; he wyll gyve no suche counsell. Imperyall Majestye Whan thu art a broade where doest thy lodgynge take? Sedicyon Amonge suche people as God ded never make; Not only cuckoldes, but suche as folowe the Popes lawes In disgysed coates with balde crownes lyke jacke dawes. Imperyall Majestye Than every where thu art the Popes altogyther. Sedicyon Ye had proved it ere thys if I had not chaunced hyther I sought to have served yow lyke as I ded Kynge John, But that Veryte stopte me, the devyll hym poyson! Nobylyte He is wurthie to dye and there were men nomore. Cyvyle Order Hange up the vyle knave and kepe hym no longar in store. Imperyall Majestye Drawe hym to Tyburne; lete hym be hanged and quartered. Sedicyon Whye of late dayes ye sayde I shoulde not so be martyred. Where is the pardon that ye ded promyse me? Imperyall Majestye For doynge more harme thu shalt sone pardoned be. Have hym fourth, Cyvyle Ordre, and hange hym tyll he be dead, And on London Brydge loke ye bestowe hys head. Cyvyle Order I shall see it done and returne to yow agayne. Sedicyon I beshrewe your hart for takynge so muche payne. Some man tell the Pope I besyche ye with all my harte, How I am ordered for takynge the Churches parte, That I maye be put in the Holye Letanye With Thomas Beckett, for I thynke I am as wurthye. Praye to me with candels for I am a saynt alreadye. O blessed Saynt Partryck, I see the, I, verylye. [Exeunt Civil Order and Sedition] Imperyall Majestye I see by thys wretche there hath bene muche faulte in ye; Shewe your selves herafter more sober and wyse to be. Kynge Johan ye subdued for that he ponnyshed treason, Rape, theft, and murther, in the holye spirytualte. But Thomas Becket ye exalted without reason Because that he dyed for the Churches wanton lyberte, That the priestes myght do all kyndes of inyquyte And be unponnyshed. Marke now the judgement Of your ydle braynes and for Gods love repent. Nobylyte As God shall judge me I repent me of my rudenesse. Clergye I am ashamed of my most vayne folyshenesse. Nobylyte I consydre now that God hath for Sedicyon Sent ponnyshmentes great. Examples we have in Brute, In Catilyne, in Cassius, and fayer Absolon, Whome of their purpose God alwayes destytute, And terryble plages on them ded execute For their rebellyon. And therfor I wyll be ware Least hys great vengeaunce trappe me in suche lyke snare. [Enter Civil Order.] Clergye I pondre also that sens the tyme of Adam The Lorde evermore the governours preserved. Examples we fynde in Noe and in Abraham, In Moyses and David, from whome God never swerved. I wyll therfor obeye least he be with me displeased. Homerus doth saye that God putteth fourth hys shyelde The prynce to defende whan he is in the fyelde. Cyvyle Order Thys also I marke: whan the priestes had governaunce Over the Hebrues the sectes ded first aryse As Pharisees, Sadducees and Essees, whych wrought muche grevaunce Amonge the people by their most devylysh practyse, Tyll destructyons the prynces ded devyse To the quyetnesse of their faythfull commens all, As your grace hath done with the sectes papistycall. Imperyall Majestye That poynt hath in tyme fallen to your memoryes. The Anabaptystes, a secte newe rysen of late, The scriptures poyseneth with their subtle allegoryes, The heades to subdue after a sedicyouse rate. The cytie of Mynster was lost through their debate. They have here begonne their pestilent sedes to sowe, But we trust in God to increase they shall not growe. Clergye God forbyd [they] shoulde for they myght do muche harme Cyvyle Order We shall cut them short if they do hyther swarme. Imperyall Majestye The adminystracyon of a princes governaunce Is the gifte of God and hys hygh ordynaunce, Whome with all your power yow thre ought to support In the lawes of God to all hys peoples comfort. First yow, the Clergye, in preachynge of Gods worde Than yow, Nobilyte, defendynge with the sworde; Yow, Cyvyle Order in executynge justyce. Thus I trust we shall seclude all maner of vyce, And after we have establyshed our kyngedome In peace of the Lorde and in hys godly fredome, We wyll confirme it with wholesom lawes and decrees, To the full suppressynge of Antichristes vanytees. Hic omnes rex osculatur. Farwele to ye all; first to yow Nobilyte, Than to yow, Clergye, than to yow, Cyvylyte; And above all thynges remembre our injunctyon. Omnes Una By the helpe of God yche one shall do hys functyon. [Exit Imperial Majesty.] Nobylyte By thys example ye maye see with your eyes How Antichristes whelpes have noble princes used. Agayne ye maye see how they with prodigyouse lyes And craftes uncomely their myschiefes have excused. Both nature, manhode, and grace they have abused, Defylynge the lawe, and blyndynge Nobilyteâ No Christen regyon from their abusyons free. Clergye Marke wele the dampnable bestowynge of their masses With their foundacyons for poysenynge of their kynge. Their confessyon driftes all other traytery passes. A saynt [they] can make of the most knave thys daye lyvynge, Helpynge their market. And to promote the thynge He shall do myracles. But he that blemysh their glorye Shall be sent to helle without anye remedye. Cyvyle Order Here was to be seane what ryseth of Sedicyon And howe he doth take hys mayntenaunce and grounde Of ydle persones brought upp in supersticyon, Whose daylye practyse is alwayes to confounde Such as myndeth vertu and to them wyll not be bounde. Expedyent it is to knowe their pestylent wayes, Consyderynge they were so busye now of late dayes. Nobylyte Englande hath a quene, thankes to the Lorde above, Whych maye be a lyghte to other princes all For the godly wayes whome she doth dayly move To hir liege people through Gods wurde specyall. She is that Angell, as Saynt Johan doth hym call, That with the Lordes seale doth marke out hys true servauntes. Pryntynge in their hartes hys holy wourdes and covenauntes. Clergye In Danyels sprete she hath subdued the Papistes With all the ofsprynge of Antichristes generacyon; And now of late dayes the secte of Anabaptistes She seketh to suppresse for their pestiferouse facyon. She vanquysheth also the great abhomynacyon Of supersticyons, witchecraftes and hydolatrye, Restorynge Gods honoure to hys first force and bewtye. Cyvyle Order Praye unto the Lorde that hir grace maye contynewe The dayes of Nestor to our sowles consolacyon; And that hir ofsprynge maye lyve also to subdewe The great Antichriste with hys whole generacyon, In Helias sprete to the confort of thys nacyon; Also to preserve hir most honourable counsell To the prayse of God and glorye of the Gospell. Thus endeth the two playes of Kynge Johan.</field>
