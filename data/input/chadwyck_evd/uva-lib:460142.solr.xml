      <field name="fulltext">BELISARIUS. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Who hath not heard of Belisarius' fate, The guardian warrior of Rome's sinking state? His open foes with glory he o'ercame, But could not Envy's rancorous venom tame: And when unnumber'd dangers he had braved, Was forced to beg from those his arm had saved. By malice render'd blind, he took his stand, And ask'd for charity's assisting hand. With honour, shame, thus Ministers could sport, Such was the gratitude which fill'd a court. Shakespeare, who rich in genius, dared pourtray Whate'er imagination could survey, Or possibility's wide scope contain, Who mingled Kings and Jesters in his strain, Would not perhaps have scrupled here to trace The Hero's utmost lowness of disgrace; Nature and truth his power would have confest, And sympathetic woe fill'd every breast. Not thus the humbler Author of to night, He feels the blaze of his superiour light, Laments the chains which modern play-wrights bind, The shackles which controul the elastic mind, And fears (tho dignified by worth and age) To bring a Beggar on the Tragic stage. He paints him great, he paints him in distress, In battle stern, in peace intent to bless; Loyal mid persecution most unjust, Severely steady to his patriot trust; Yet not insensible to sorrow's dart, With Cato's virtues, not his stoic heart; With the nice feelings which adorn the man, Yet firmly rivetted to honour's plan. He paints the griefs his relatives sustain, Filial affection, sharp domestic pain, Griefs which the finer nerves of passion tear, And pain creating frenzy and despair. Oh! may our efforts aid our Bard's design, And on your breasts stamp each pathetic line! So shall we draw the tear from Beauty's eye, So shall each manly bosom heave a sigh; So shall the moral scene your hearts engage, And nature, sense, and virtue, grace our stage.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Square of the City. Eumenes, Caius, meeting. Eum. Welcome brave Caius from the field of war! The field of victory! A witness thou To the defeat of that innumerous host Which threatened sad Byzantium with destruction, And shook the Roman empire to it's base. A witness to the deeds of Belisarius! His wondrous deeds! A partner in his dangers While me, the duty of my station bound, Reluctant, in inactive ease at home. I envy thee my Caius. Caius. Such a day The ever-circling sun hath ne'er beheld. An enemy more dreadful than these Huns Our legions ne'er encounter'd. Belisarius Seem'd more than man; beneath the frost of age He glow'd with youthful fire; his veteran bands Roused by his great example, rush'd to fight Like lions when enraged; wheree'er they turn'd Dismay attended; they alone were victors: For at the first attack, our new-raised levies Fled panic-struck, nor join'd, but to pursue, And slay the routed foe. Eum. We feel his worth; And gratitude swells every panting bosom. Byzantium pours forth all her sons to meet, And grace his triumph. E'en his enemies Now wear the face of joy, and speak his praise. Caius. Is it not strange, that he, so great in arms, So gentle in the placid hours of peace, So generous, that his hand though ever open, Is never tired of giving, so sincere That he ne'er promised what he'd not perform, Should yet have enemies, who wish his downfall? Eum. Envy, my friend, is their's; the toad which lyes Within the stony heart, changing the air, The balmy air of heaven, to it's own nature, And sweltering in it's venom. Caius. This success, This glorious victory will destroy the reptile, And all it's hated brood. This splendid triumph Will level opposition with the ground. Nor will Justinian e'er forsake the man To whom he owes his empire and his life. Eum. Alas! I fear— Caius. Thou dost not fear Justinian? Eum. No, not Justinian: but the treacherous Narbal, And Theodora's malice. Cruel empress! Dissembling politician! Caius. All their efforts Will now be vain; and he who saved the state, Shall guide it by his wisdom. (Shouts.) Eum. Hark! he comes! I hear the echoing multitude. Caius. What pleasure, What heart-felt pleasure must the godlike man Experience now! This triumph of his age! Transcending all his former! They for realms And nations to the Roman yoke restored: This, for a victory, which the Roman name, And e'en the very being of the empire, Preserved from total ruin. Eum. More than this, To triumph with the youth, the gallant youth Who wedded his Marcella. He petition'd That his brave son might share with him the glory, Who nobly shared the toil. Caius. In Phorbas' actions Will Belisarius live again; his soul Shines with his fathers' virtues. (Shouts and trumpets,) Eum. Hark? more near The heroes come! I hasten to the palace. Caius. I mingle with the pomp. (Exeunt.) SCENE II. A triumphal Arch on one side, the Palace in front. Enter Belisarius and Phorbas in triumph, &amp;c. Soldiers with trophies, standards, &amp;c. Prisoners, &amp;c. (Shouts.) MUSIC. ODE. I. From the wild and savage north Lo! the furies rushing forth! Barbarous war with slaughter died, Rapine fell with giant stride. Who shall meet them in the field? Who his fainting country shield? CHORUS. Who shall meet them, &amp;c. II. Patriot virtue glowing bright Darts impetuous to the fight. From the lightning of his eye See the baneful furies fly! Peace expands her genial wings Every hill and valley sings. CHORUS. Peace expands, &amp;c. III. Join the willing song of praise, Notes of grateful transport raise To the heroes, to the band, Saviours of their native land, Who have gained a deathless name; Our's is freedom, their's be fame! GRAND CHORUS. Join the willing song, &amp;c. [The procession passes over the stage. Scene draws and discovers the inside of the Palace. A magnificent apartment. Justinian, Theodora, Narbal, Decius, &amp;c.] Enter Belisarius, Phorbas, Guards, Prisoners, &amp;c. who are ranged on each side of the stage. Justinian descends from his throne, and meets Belisarius. Justinian. Thou guardian genius of our sinking state! In whom the antient Roman virtue lives! Receive thy sovereign's thanks! And thou brave youth, Great is our debt to thee! my heart o'erflows With tides of joy. The fount of life surcharged, Even to bursting swells. Did any eye Behold thy triumph with malignant glance, Quench'd be it's light! and perish henceforth all Who dare between us foster discontent, And sullen jealousy! Theo. Ye triumph here, In the enraptured soul of gratitude. Bel. What words, what language, aptly to repay Our sovereign's praises, shall our tongues employ? We fought, we conquer'd, duty claim'd the first, The last was heaven's. Let silence speak the rest. Just. Thou son, and pupil of this matchless chief! On thee shall rain our favours. Phor. Small the share Of merit I can boast, tho raised by him, And by thy partial voice to share his fame. Bel. Thy modesty gives false report my son; Thy courage, and thy coolness more than once Poised the descending scale of victory. Even before I prompted thou wert ready, And years mature bore witness to thy conduct. Just. Oh! from the soldier learn sincerity, And lowliness of mind, ye sons of peace, Unused to toil! Who in the sunshine bask Which gilds a court.—Now Belisarius, heroe, Thy warlike labours end. The Persian conquer'd, The western empire from barbarians free'd, Afric restored, the Huns to slaughter doom'd, Or prisoners led; with me reform the state, Thy valour hath preserved. With us reside; Be ever near a faithful monitor: The sacred urim, and prophetic spirit, By which each act of mine shall be directed. Narbal. (Aside.) My curses on them! in their noon-tide height Unless I err, shall darkness overwhelm them. Just. Let us revise the laws, correct abuse, In our more distant provinces new-brace The discipline relax'd, and gird the whole Of our vast empire in the bond of order. Bel. Alas Justinian! Just. Do my words displease thee? Bel. They penetrate my soul. Alas! too high Would'st thou exalt me. Diverse are the gifts To diverse men assign'd. The task exceeds A soldier's talents. Just. To this task what need we? But native sense, unyielding honesty, And pure fidelity? Bel. Most generous Prince! I feel the frosty hand of age upon me, Yet a few years and I must sink beneath it. Tho mean ambition's sons I always scorn'd, And every honour but the silent praise Of my own heart; tho low, compared with that The statesman's policy, the general's sway, And the triumphal car; yet, plunged in action Through a long life, I own I sigh for peace. Men I have read enough; I would myself Contemplate but a little time, and die. Just. The loss is mine. Whither would'st thou retire? Bel. In fair Ionia lyes a rural vale, Thy bounty, when we quell'd the invading Persian; There would I with reflection walk, there spend The remnant of my days; and offer up My morning orisons, and evening prayer For thine, and for the empire's happiness. Just. Tho I might hope—but no; our will submits, Nor casts the least restraint on any thought Of thine.—What further boon can we impart? Thy absence is the greatest. Bel. Am I free? And shall I not desire another's freedom? Dismiss these captives to their snow-clad wilds, And let them learn, O Prince, from thy example The blessings of humanity. Just. Go! ye are free. (They bend to Justinian and Belisarius.) (Exeunt.) Just. What else my friend? is there an enemy Whose punishment thou ask'st for, it is granted. Bel. The sanguinary bosom of revenge Was never mine. I know not one whose downfall Would give a transient pleasure to my soul. Blest be my enemies! They oft have taught me Most wholesome lessons. Where exists the mind So fierce, as not to yield to generosity? An enemy whom mercy cannot vanquish? Just. E'er thy departure hence, command our power. Whate'er is placed within it's ample scope Is freely thine. Bel. Clad in the vest of youth, In prime of strength, and nervous intellect, To thy protection I resign my son. Just. Thy staff of general—take it, (to Phorbas) and succeed To all thy father's honours. Phor. May I wear them With half his glory! Justinian (to Belisarius.) Noblest of mankind! Thy habitation goodness shall illume, And wisdom consecrate. Domains most pure! A court, where real monarchy will dwell, Undignified by pomp, unthroned, uncrown'd, Thou to true grandeur, which an emperor looks on With virtuous envy; I to toil.—Farewell! [Exeunt Justinian, Theodora, Belisarius, &amp;c. Narbal and Decius remain. Nar. Didst thou behold this pageantry? Dec. I did. Nar. And thou hast seen the rain-bow arch the sky, Fixing each base on two aspiring hills, Then sudden fade.—So fade these air-born heroes. Dec. How wilt thou move Justinian? Nar. Know'st thou not His timid mind? And how with skilful reins The empress at her pleasure guides each passion? Dec. Her power is great, Nar. Most absolute.—Thou hatest This Belisarius— Dec. Deep is my aversion. Nar. Not without cause. His son usurps the post Due to thy age and worth. I read thy soul, And confidence succeeded.—Theodora, A bigot in her faith, detests the man, Who dares with sacrilegious step proceed, Scorning the limits of the holy pale. Always was he my enemy: and once E'en to Justinian's ear urged my dismission. For which good turn—with speed— Dec. Unfold thy plan. Nar. Suppose thou seest a slave of Belisarius, Begging admittance at the dead of night To Theodora's presence. Urgent business He pleads; the welfare of the Roman state Her life, Justinian's, all that she holds dear, Depends upon the tale he shall disclose. Blank horror cloaths his cheek, his trembling lips Often endeavour to perform their office, And often fail. Dec. Proceed. Nar. He smites his breast, Cursing his fate, that e'er he should be witness To actions of the master whom he loves, Which publish'd, will draw ruin on his head, But which impelling conscience will not suffer To hide in silence. Dec. Well described. Go on. Nar. Fast fall his tears. He says, that in the evening, Having too freely drank, to shun discovery, He sought out an apartment seldom used, There lay conceal'd. Sleep every sense oppress'd. Awaked by murmuring voices, cautiously And slow he drew his breath. The voices raised Proclaim'd them Belisarius' and his son's. Dec. Well-acting slave, and plausible!—What follows? Nar. He tells her that they spake to this effect. The emperor old and superstitious, Priest-ridden, governed by his wife and Narbal, Deserved no longer to direct the helm Of this vast monarchy. That Belisarius Might mount with ease into the seat of empire. Then read they various letters; one from Narses, Who now with glory spreads in Italy His conquering banners, urging the attempt, So he might bear the purple in the west. Another from the Persian Prince with offers Of strong assistance, or a sure asylum. The veterans too, with whom he lately quell'd The barbarous Huns, will aid his daring purpose. And that securely he may strike the blow, He feigns retirement to his rural vale In fair Ionia. Dec. Is the slave so perfect? Nar. Shrewd, hardy, void of fear, from whom no tortures Could wring the secret—Still in thy mind's eye. Observe the progress. View how Theodora Assails Justinian. See the letters found, Produced, examined; the known hand of Narses; The seal of Persia. Hear to strengthen all, Claudius the Senator, by me suborn'd; He hath been sounded, trusted with their plan, To crush our now-successful christian doctrines; And in our sacred temples re-establish The idol worship. Hear how Eutyches Justinian's favour'd priest, his soul's director, Urges this plea with all his eloquence. View superstition gain predominance, That all-o'er-ruling principle, and love, Honour, respect, and every recent merit Shall nought avail.—E'er morn my friend, my Decius, Shall these twin stars beneath the horizon set, To rise no more. Dec. Till then my thoughts will lye On expectations rack. Nar. Yet calmly smile. Retire; but hold thyself prepared to aid us, As time shall warrant. Cherish bold ambition. The army shall be thine. Retire my friend. (Exit Decius.) Nar. Oh! the delicious draught of sweet revenge Unto the thirsty lip! e'en to the lees I'll drain the cup, and satiate all my soul. Say Belisarius should retreat—He leaves His son behind, taught doubtless to perplex, To thwart my plans; perchance to worm himself Into Justinian's favour.—Ye are fathom'd All-potent conquerors! short sighted heroes! Let but Justinian with his usual ease And weak credulity be led, and down, Down to the regions of the grave ye fall, While Narbal holds uncurb'd the sovereign sway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An Apartment in the House of Belisarius. Phorbas, Marcella. Mar. Forgive me, Phorbas! but the scenes of night Are still before my eyes. I saw thee clad As yesterday, in rich triumphal robes; I stood as then, upon the northern tower Marking thy gallant entrance. On a sudden Dark dismal clouds whence sulphurous lightnings flash'd Opposed my view. When strait I saw thee dead, Cover'd with wounds, and Narbal waving o'er thee A sword bedew'd with blood. I waked in horror; Nor can I yet erase the deep impression. Phor. And shall unreal dreams disturb thy peace? Disjointed emblems of our waking thoughts? Where is the wisdom of Marcella's mind? True, we have fear'd the base deceit of Narbal; But fresh-adorn'd with honour and renown, With power invested, in Justinian's love Fix'd firm, in vain will he and Theodora Their malice point, which stingless, shall inflict No mortal wound. Mar. Why cannot we retire With Belisarius? What is power or fame, To those unenvied joys which bless the country? Phor. What joys can thy imagination paint? Mar. Ah! canst thou ask me? Should I not possess Thy much-lov'd converse? balm of every care? The verdure of the fields, the gurgling brooks, The high oaks quivering to the western gale, The yellow corn-field, and melodious note Of lark, or nightingale, to me are joys Of secondary consequence. Phor. No more, Alluring temptress! inclination leads With thee to pleasing fond ideal haunts; But duty, fame, and virtue fix me here. Well have thy father's actions earn'd retirement, Like autumn's fruits thick hang his honours on him, Mine are but in the blossom.—lo! he comes! Belisarius advancing. Welcome the prospect of serene delight! Of calm content, whose gentle rays shall gild The evening of my life! unvex'd by storms Which shake ambition; far from hate and guile; And the pernicious blast of sickening envy. (Seeing Marcella and Phorbas.) My Phorbas! my Marcella!—and behold (Enter Antonina and Junius.) Junius and Antonina!—sweetest boy! Thy tongue shall charm the weary hours of age, And soothe it's pains.—Oh! best and most beloved! This is the auspicious time which sets me free. Not with more heart-felt pleasure doth the rustic After the toils of day, at sun-set enter His lowly home. Like the old warrior horse, Dismiss'd by some kind master, to his hills, And verdant meads, once more shall I revisit The paths of nature, and sensations feel Long unexperienc'd. Phor. Thus the ancient Roman, From dictatorial pomp his farm regain'd, Array'd in glory.—Fit for every station Art thou; the warrior, politician, sage, In thee are blended. Bel. What from some, my son, Might be deem'd flattery, in thee is love, Respect, and filial duty.—To thy hands My charge, the good Justinian hath deliver'd! And, trust me, an important one it is, Requiring all thy vigour. Oh! be still, Just, and humane! to strictest discipline Add tender care, so shall the soldiers bless thee. Be to thy enemies, in battle, dreadful; But spare the suppliant, spare the unarmed head. Nor ever let the old disbanded warrior Taste of distress and penury. Phor. To thee I owe whate'er I am!—to thy example Whate'er I shall be. Bel. Bear thyself upright In camp, or court; despise the unsound policy Of knavish cunning. Far above the reach Of the mean villain soars illustrious greatness, And excellence of soul.—Yet prudent be thou, And circumspect. Above the rest of men Beware of Narbal; trust not Theodora. Safe in thy proper dignity, nor dread, Nor with blind confidence repose on others. Why weeps my daughter? Mar. Happiness is yours. Here splendid care and discontent reside. Fain would I sacrifice some years of life Thus to retreat. Bel. Be comforted my daughter. In such a dearth of goodness, duty calls On youths who like thy Phorbas feel the flame Of patriot love, to mingle with the crew Of base pretenders.—I but go before Your steward, and purveyor. Each addition Of use or ornament, I shall be pleased To think you one day will possess, and love The building, for the builder. Every tree I plant, will please me, when I shall reflect You and your children will enjoy the shade. It is not probable his days of trouble Will equal mine; long e'er he shall arrive At my extent of years, I hope the army, The state will spare him. Enter Caius. Caius! hah! thy errand! Caius. The messenger of ill I come. Oh! fly! Quit these vile dwellings of deceit and fraud With rapid eagle's speed! By Narbal trusted, Eumenes is your friend: from him I come. Deep is the plot, and strong is the conspiracy, Tho it's extent he knows not. He and Decius Are ordered to convey you to the palace, While Entyches among his pious brethren Whispers malignant lies; that you propose Our worship to o'erthrow, and rear again The pagan structure from its mouldering ruins. Narbal and Theodora have determined That not your long deserts, your bravery, virtue, Nor e'en your new-won triumph shall protect you. Eumenes sees no safety but in flight. Haste! frustrate by your speed the dire intent Of base malevolence.—I must away, Lest intercepted I should share your fate, And lose all future power to aid, to serve you. (Exit. Ant. Oh! fly! this instant fly! Mar. Lose not a moment. Phor. Haste to Nicanor! by the port he dwells, And will with speed convene the band of veterans. In the first bark we find, with our domestics Steer we for Asia, where all hearts are thine. Meanwhile the veterans shall secure our passage. Bel. Steer thou for Asia! seek its farthest climes! Fly all! but Belisarius here remains. Ant. A prey to Narbal? Bel. Not a fugitive, Proclaiming guilt. Ant. I see, alas! thy death. Bel. Which I have never fear'd. Mar. Yet pity us! Bel. I do. But will not skreen myself by baseness. Mar. What refuge then remains? Bel. Our innocence. Mar. What guard is that? Bel. More than encircling armies; It fortifies the heart. Mar. Oh! we are lost! I see my Phorbas all our fate before us, Painted in blackest characters I see it. O Belisarius, if thou wilt not yield To our intreaties, kill us not with sternness! Kneel Junius! heed, oh! heed his infant prayer! Bel. Why wound me thus Marcella! I knew not That I was stern. Your looks, your sighs affect me. Various are now the feelings of my soul; Pity for you, indignant rage, disdain, And love of glory. Mid the different conflict The latter triumphs. Belisarius must not Sink in his own opinion. Grief may rend My heart; treatment unmerited stir up Resentment in me; but my eye shall not Quit sight of the guiding star, fix'd rectitude, That never sets.—Lead these distress'd apart! Fear not. Prosperity again will smile. Lead them apart my son!—I meet alone These messengers. [Exeunt. Belisarius (alone.) 'Tis true. I feel it now in every nerve— The energy of virtue. It supports, Enlightens, strengthens.—Tryer of mankind! Adversity! come onward! I will meet thee With open arms. To the unprepared heart How dreadful are thy terrors!—All that's pass'd, A bright extent of fame, beyond thy power Is placed.—Tho they have reach'd my stage of being, How many sink oblivious!—I have lived Compared with them, this mortal life thrice o'er. With blessings, praises, willing honours crown'd, Unforced, unbought applause.—The recollection Warms me throughout, and thaws the frost of age Which otherwise would make the thicken'd blood Curdle within it's mazy labyrinths. Yet am I man—nature is powerful still— A sigh will rise; a tear will fall—firm bound Is the connubial, the parental chain. Whatever link is shock'd, the faithful center Feels the vibration.—In myself prepared To meet each accident, for them my soul Is soft as melting wax.—No more of this.— I'm ready.—Yet is passive fortitude More arduous, than most intrepid action. Enter Decius, Eumenes, Caius, Slave, and Guards. Dec. The Emperor's mandate. Bel. I obey his orders; And am your prisoner. Take my sword; it's edge None but his enemies e'er felt. The weapon Is little worth; the cause it hath been used in Was always just. My son is comprehended Within this schedule; he will soon attend. What is the imputed crime? Dec. My orders urge me To haste immediate, nor admit a parley. This faithful slave discovers hidden letters, And doubtless those the criminal hath read. Bel. I read upon thy forehead, Narbal's creature; And in his eyes, a lye. Dec. Suspect not us; Narbal and Decius are thy friends. Bel. Ulysses Pleaded for Palamedes, when he placed The gold within his tent, which caused his death. Dec. I oft have mark'd, and wonder'd how serenity Can with the traitor dwell. O shame! Justinian Hath loaded thee with generous acts of kindness, For which thy honest hand would plant a dagger In his unthinking heart. Bel. At length thy words Betray thee. So the serpent lurks awhile Hissing beneath his bush, e'er he discovers His speckled crest, and brandishes his sting. Dec. I came not to impart, or hear reproaches. Tullus with me. (to the Slave.) Eumenes guard the passage. I will secure his son, these papers seize, And strait return.— (Exeunt Decius and Slave, &amp;c. Eum. Retire, and keep the door. (to the guards.) Caius remain. O Belisarius would'st thou not Enjoy thy liberty? Bel. It's golden hours Are worth a kingdom's price. Eum. They may be thine. Bel. What mean'st thou? Eum. We have sounded The guards, and half will join the flight; should Decius Offer resistance, he would rue the trial. Meanwhile thy family may gain the port; We soon will follow. Bel. Am I then so alter'd? Dost thou not know me? Who am I? Eum. The man Whom I most honour, Belisarius, This age's glory, and it's wonder. Bel. Hold— No more.—Years have not changed or warp'd my nature; I still am Belisarius. Art thou answer'd? Eum. I am perforce. Bel. Thy friendship I have always Regarded well. This testimony of it I mean to bury deep within my breast, Nor let it ever rise to light against thee. Enter Decius, Phorbas, &amp;c. Bel. Thy looks infect my aged eyes, my son. How did'st thou leave them? Phor. Overcome with grief, Too violent to utter their complaints. They only wring their hands, sitting in silence And motionless as statues. I should there Have grown into the earth, had not stern force Dragg'd me away.—'Twere best you saw them not. Bel. I see them now too well. My heart o'erflows With sympathising pity. Weakness causes not Thy tears or mine; for they deserve the tribute. So excellent in nature, so affectionate, With meekest duty joining tenderest love; Deep will affliction penetrate their souls, And I feel all the wound. O my good youth!— Dec. Are you prepared? Bel. We are. The stroke of malice May stun, but not destroy. I've seen the soldier Tho sunk upon his knee, rebound with vigour, And slay the enemy who gave the blow. If overcome, he for his country died, And cheated death, acquiring endless glory. The field is not the only bed of honour; The gloomy prison, torturing wheel, or scaffold Virtue can sanctify. The thoughts of men No power controuls, and aftertimes embalm The memory of the good. Guilt trembles ever; Fearful thro life; and on the silken bed, Or stretch'd on roses, sees with ghastly eye Death's flow, but sure approach. It's end is dreadful; A lesson to the present, to posterity A tale of ignominy and contempt. Proceed.—We follow. SCENE II. Antonina. Marcella. Mar. Oh! should he die, I never would survive him. No more of hope—I see no ray of light Thro the wild waste to guide our devious feet. Yet bounteous heaven ordains, when fortune lowers, And with fierce rage the growing tempest swells, Mid all it's bitterest wrath, a friendly dagger Will give us peace. (pulls out a dagger.) Fla. Oh! shun despair Marcella, The worst of fiends!—that fatal weapon banish. Mar. No.—But till human strength can bear no more, And from the conflict shrinks—it rests in peace. Ant. Why prophecy their deaths? Heroes e'er now Have felt the weight of ignominious bonds, Yet rose superior to their vaunting foes. Say, can Justinian in his height of power Dare to command? In their full scope of cruelty Can Theodora, can the treacherous Narbal Prompt the dire act of murther? Will they hazard The chance of tumult? the awaken'd anger Of all the Roman provinces? Can Phorbas, Can Belisarius perish so unjustly? And vengeance sleep? Trust me, ten thousand arms Will soon be raised; and e'en among his guards, The troops conspire, to pull destruction down Upon the offenders heads. Mar. And what avails The tardy punishment? why do not now While yet they live, vindictive armies rise? The dead are soon forgotten; who disturbs Their slumbers? Friendship passes far aloof With blushing face, or at the midnight hour May seek the tomb, then wring her hands together, And say, too late my aid; e'er death prevented, Why strove I not to save them? Ant. I mistrust not The righteous gods; who ever heed the cause, The sacred cause of innocence and virtue. Mar. The gods are just, are good. Shall I arraign Their high o'erruling power?—Oh! where ye sit, (Kneeling) Throned in the insufferable blaze of light, Look down with pitying eyes, and in the time Of deep adversity, sustain, preserve Those whom your own enlivening spirit form'd The best, the noblest of the human race! Ant. It dawns. The face of hope more bright appears. Justinian cannot but protect the men To whom his utmost gratitude is due. But should he fail to guard them in the hour Of sad distress, by calumny assail'd, Let us in weeds of mourning seek the empress, And prostrate at her feet— Mar. O mean expedient! Idle, and fruitless!—Shall the honour'd wife Of Belisarius, shall his daughter stoop To abject condescension? Ant. Could we save them, Shall nice fastidious notions interfere? Or haughtiness restrain us? In her youth, Unconscious of her present state of greatness, We interchanged the vows of equal friendship. Tho now ambition has usurp'd her mind, And bigot zeal; yet when her eyes behold us Prone on the ground, the embers may revive Of ancient love, and by humility We gain a prize above the wealth of worlds. Mar. Oh! I have raised my towering thoughts too high. Admiring all the godlike qualities Of my great father, blended happily In Phorbas' breast, I fed my eager soul Till it dilating view'd with fix'd indifference Each sublunary being. Kings themselves Sunk far beneath me brought to the sacred touch Of this comparison. Now cast I off Pride, glowing shame. To my condition levell'd, I own the dust my origin! and fall, Press'd by the hand of strong necessity, Where, for myself, to gain a thousand years Of mortal life, I should refuse to bend. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Palace. Justinian, Theodora, Narbal. Just. Above each earthly tye we owe our duty To thee, O most adored! By thee supported, I dare with firmness raise the rod of iron O'er thy contemners! Pious Eutyches With holy fervour hath enlarged my heart. His arguments and thine, my Theodora, Were pregnant with conviction. Justice triumphs. Yet would I not to death pursue its dictates; Degraded from their honours, and exiled, They pay the debt of treason. Mild their punishment, Shewing our sense of past deserts. And mercy, No less than justice, is the attribute Of awful Deity.—Shall man then sin? And shall not man relent? Theo. Dost thou again relapse into thy weakness? Is this the firm resolve to do heaven service? But oh! remember, tho in private station Thy soul might yield unblamed to melting pity, Not to himself alone the sovereign lives; Millions on thee depend, to thee look up For preservation. Wouldst thou then to save The proved offenders, view our fertile provinces Laid waste by civil broils? Our cities sack'd? Subjects gainst subjects warring? Shall the cross Which now triumphant stands, beneath the feet Of heathens press the dust? Just. Yet is it strange So many battles fought, and victories won, Nations subdued, armies at his disposal, He should not till arrived at the utmost verge Of trembling life, against our power rebel, And strive for mastery. Theo. Who can explain The contradictions of the human mind? Yet oft, tho youthful years will turn abhorrent From deeds of treachery; when age steals on, Each early scyon in the spring put forth, And e'en by manhood cherish'd, will be blasted. Nar. Such must be Belisarius. Lost in wonder, Scarce can I now give credence to the proofs, Forceful and clear, of his ingratitude. But Brutus slew his father and his friend. Wives have imbrued their hands in husbands blood, Brothers have slain their unsuspecting brother, Urged by the fiend ambition.—O Justinian! Would that my death could purchase lasting firmness To all thy plans, in deepest wisdom form'd To bless thy subjects, and secure forever The faith by thee protected! Would to heaven The life of Belisarius could be spared! Nor Phorbas perish! Just. Will no danger spring From out their ashes?—Justice hath decreed, The safety of the state demands their deaths. The slave the letters found, the answers penn'd, The words of Claudius urge the stern decree. But ne'er could they alone this deed contrive Of black detested villainy.—Will treason, And restive mutiny be slain with them? Rather I see uprising multitudes Quickened to action, and conspiracy On every side, with mortal violence, And open front, advance against our throne. Theo. Let it advance! Must I again Justinian Tell thee, a kingdom is a glorious tomb? Thy arguments should rather string the nerves Of speedy execution. Winged minutes Haste on to safety; while the tardy step Of dull suspicion stumbles at the threshold, And wakes the fury danger in her cave. Nar. Say we protract the fate of Belisarius, And sound the populace? If his confinement They bear with ineffectual murmurs only, We lose not our caution. Death may follow.— Or say the sword on Phorbas first descend; Without his active aid, tho Belisarius Should even be enlarged, the treasonous head Wanting the hand, will give no birth to terror. Just. The guardian care of Providence protect me! And your true aid, and counsel! Let the sword Descend on Phorbas.—Hold—receive our signet. Act as ourselves—their fate is in thy hands. Nar. With pity and reluctance, to Eumenes I bear thy orders. [Exit. Just. Theodora! oh! How keen my feelings! never did I sentence Without a pang, the meanest of my subjects; But now what torture racks my inmost soul, And tears each finer nerve of bleeding friendship! Yes, witness heaven, how dearly I esteem'd them! Should they be guiltless!—But their crimes are obvious. How would the tongues of men exclaim against me! How branded to the world should I appear, How base in history's impartial page! Their guilt is manifest—these pangs are nature's. Religion, public love approve the deed. Oh! calm my soul! Yet tho excelling all Thy sex in wisdom, fruitless were the task. Time only can perform that office; time Which softly checks the reins of headstrong grief, And by degrees wears out the trace of memory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Palace. Marcella, Antonina, Junius. Ant. Methinks these walls are changed with their inhabitants; Dark do they seem, and hateful to the sight. Is this the place where sedulous attention, Obsequious homage, and the voice of gladness Pursued our steps? Where each beholder's eye Caught at our transient looks? our transient smiles? Mar. The change is in ourselves. The fickle croud Surrounding greatness, like the flies of June Ope to the sun their many-coloured wings; When damps arise, and evening dews descend, They sicken, and are seen no more. Ant. Unused to fear, I tremble, and my knees Unstable, scarce support my aged frame. Who passes yonder? Decius! Tho my soul Abhors communication with that traitor, He may be useful.—Decius! Dec. Who are ye, That in despite of happiness and joy Enter these walls array'd in weeds of sorrow? Ant. O affecttation vile! Insulting meanness! From thee that question? Know'st thou not the daughter Of Belisarius? Oft hast thou before him Duck'd low thy pliant head, often to her, Often to me, cringed like a fawning spaniel. Are happiness and joy within these walls? False as thou art, thou wilt not dare assert it. The fate of heroes hangs in dread suspense, And all who feel one glimmering ray of virtue Grieve in their hearts. Narbal and all his slaves, Tho clad in smiles, are tortured with anxiety. Justinian, Theodora, have their fears. Dec. Was it thy purpose to upbraid me thus? Shame to my easy nature which obey'd The call of pride. Vain woman! to the winds Cast thy reproaches. Decius hears no more. [Exit Ant. Thou groveling miscreant hence! Enter Eumenes. Say, are our features Unknown to thee? are we so soon forgotten? Eum. Forget you! know you not! The sun shall cease To roll in heaven, e'er I forget the family Of Belisarius, and of Phorbas. Mar. Worthy, Kind, kind Eumenes!—Decius cross'd our way— We hoped by his assistance to have gain'd Admission to the empress. He most tauntingly, Most cruelly, ask'd who we were. Ant. 'Tis true, 'tis true by heaven! Excuse me O Eumenes! not like him Art thou, the hungry flatterer of greatness, The needy vassal of a slavish courtier. Forgive the peevish error of my tongue, Designed for him, not thee: the stroke oblique Aim'd at another, sprung from inward pride, And female spleen. Alas! alas! Eumenes! Suppliants we come; wilt thou from Theodora Humbly request an audience? Eum. If the dart Of death were pointed to oppose my entrance. Tho much I fear she will not see you, much If seen, her ear will be to your request Most marble-nerved. Ant. Yet try her I conjure thee. Eum. Is there a task Eumenes would refuse At thy desire? I will return with speed, And bear her answer. [Exit. Ant. Tender-natured man! I for thy sake retract the rash opinion Which I had well nigh form'd, and think there may be Some honesty remaining in a court. Mar. Will she admit us think'st thou?—Hark! he comes! Was she e'er moved by melting pity?—Hark! I marvel at his stay.—Oh! for a tongue Of most persuasive eloquence, to move As music did of old, the rocks and trees, Obedient to the magic strain!—I fear All will be frustrate.—How I dread this interview! Not yet! not yet!—She will not surely see us. Oh! she is stern, and not to be intreated. I had methought conn'd in my mind a lesson; But it is flown—quite lost—confusion reigns. Poor Junius!—oh! thy mother's heart, my boy, Is torn asunder.—Generous Eumenes! Enter Eumenes. Will she admit us? How did she receive thee? What said she? Did she frown upon thy message? Eum. Most noble, and revered! too rash was I. Propitious is the hour. To Theodora I proffer'd your petition; she, with calmness, By the soft motion of a gentle smile Only disturb'd, bade me to introduce you. Ant. Supporter of the weak! whose words revive The drooping heart of sorrow, be our guide! Should'st thou be e'er unhappy, may'st thou find A friend congenial with thyself, to pity, And lend thee succour! Rather may'st thou ne'er Need his assistance! O ye gods shower down, Shower down your choicest blessings from above, And crown his days with happiness and peace! [Exeunt. SCENE II. Theodora (alone.) The eclipse is pass'd; and our imperial light May shine at length unrivall'd. Heaven is just. And pride laid low affords a spectacle, On which the greatness it before insulted Can look well pleased: e'en if religion join'd not To give her plaudit to the final ruin Of hated pagan foes.—They bore the sway— Justinian and myself were but as toys, Or secondary adventitious ornaments To grace their diadem; the homagers, And shadows of their power; the substance their's. And do they claim my pity? It is well. Enter Eumenes, Flavia, &amp;c. Eum. Most gracious empress! Belisarius' wife, His daughter, and the son of youthful Phorbas. Theo. Leave us; this tender interview requires No prying eye. [Exit. Eumenes. Most welcome! nay believe me, That thus as supplicants you come before us Our heart feels no displeasure. Ant. O Theodora! prostrate at thy feet [They kneel. See that ill-fated wretch, who heretofore Was honour'd with that dearest name, thy friend! Theo. Nay rise.—Our friend, and the illustrious daughter Of our renowned General at our feet! It shall not be. Mar. Bent lowly to the earth By dire calamity, we rise no more, Unless thou stretch thy hand benignant forth, And raise us up to life. Theo. Name your request. Ant. And need I name it? Think O Theodora What pangs we feel. The father and the husband, Loyal and innocent, dragg'd from our arms By their relentless foe; in chains; immured Within yon hateful walls, the traitor's mansion. O bleeding fame! O agony intolerable! Of which ne'er may the faintest portion touch Thy royal bosom! Theo. Wherefore kneel to me? I am no deity.—Mistaken worshippers! Go, offer up your prayers to thund'ring Baal; To pale Astarte! or your houshold gods. Where are your crouds of slaves? your robes of state? This garb of mourning! Doth this suit an empress? Her, who aspired to Theodora's station? Named you my former friendship? This your pride Long time has cancell'd. Now the crime, the guilt Of those you plead for, sink you to a depth Which mercy's peering eye in vain would fathom. [Exit. Marcella (starting up.) False woman! guilt! thine is the curse, the stain Of spotted infamy.—Hah! Antonina! And are we here! and have we knelt before her! Guilt! guilt!—Oh! wherefore didst thou bring us hither! My heart! my head!—Haste! let us hence with speed. Here serpents dwell, ingratitude, deceit, And every odious monster.—Let us hence. Ant. Cease my Marcella! dearest boy! weep not. Mar. And what is her religion! cruelty. Proud too, she call'd us—But I now am calm; This undeserved treatment hurts me not. Yet am I proud; proud of my innocence; Of thee my Junius, of thy father proud. But pomp, and grandeur, wealth, and glittering toys, Never for their intrinsic merit prized, Now vanish into nothing.—Riches court The hand of fools—the base may rise to power. The humble and the innocent are here, O'erwhelm'd with misery.—Away! Away! [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Prison. Belisarius, Phorbas, (in chains.) Bel. Deluded Prince! Oh! ill-condition'd state of empire! girt By interest and deceit, a constant cloud The regal throne envelops. At a distance Stands truth, and weeps. An eye, like lightning keen, And as the sun, commanding, is required To pierce through, or disperse the incircling gloom, And see the lovely mourner in her tears. Phor. How are we fallen! the virid leaves of hope Sear'd in their prime! O days of bliss o'erpast! Which now but deeper tent the wounds of anguish! Bel. Shall we of courage at a distance boast? And when become the inmates with misfortune, Cast back a wistful look to happiness? Shrinking beneath the rigorous embrace Of our too stern companion?—Conscious virtue Irradiating the chosen mind, forbids it To share the common fate. Phor. Nor do I faint. Nor shall thy son, my father, from thy side In this severest conflict backward turn His coward step.—Yet while resentment burns, I cannot but invoke revenge, and hurl Pernicious curses on the heads of those Who caused our ruin. Bel. Will they aught avail? Sprung from the impetuous ardour of thy youth, Will they e'er reach their bosoms? Tho I plead not For brutal apathy, yet patience gives A nobler triumph, in her awful silence Far more expressive, than the tumid look, And boistrous words of anger.—Curse them not. Phor. Perfection is not mine. Bel. Nor mine, nor any man's. Yet, what a glorious aim! seeing the fane On yonder towering eminence, to labour Up the rough passage, till we gain the height Allotted to humanity!—The mind Of busy malice hastens on our fate; 'Tis her's forever to be base and treacherous; But our's the few short moments which remain, To study how with dignity to live, With dignity to die. Phor. Again I rise. Again my father I emerge, and shake Despondence from me.—Hark! the jarring door! And footsteps which the echoing vault rebounds! Let the dark murtherer enter—we're prepared. Enter Eumenes, and Guards. Eum. Ungrateful are my tidings. Bel. Speak them boldly. Eum. I come, alas! to bear thy son from hence To speedy execution. Bel. Him alone! Eum. Such are my orders. Bel. Lead the victim forth! Never was soul more spotless offer'd up To the pure gods: fit sacrifice for heaven. Phor. Behold that best, that bravest of mankind! He taught me how to live, and, harder task, Hath taught me how to die. Bel. Let me embrace thee. I could have wish'd thee slain in glorious battle, Slain for thy country.—But to fall unjustly Is no mean fate. Thank heaven thou dost not merit The stroke of death. These tears which bathe my cheek Would then have sprung from a less noble motive, For thy polluted honour. These are nature's, Which cannot part unmoved from what it loves. Eum. Would I could lengthen out his date of life Till nature brake the seal! But fate withstands; Nor will Justinian's orders brook delay. Phor. O Belisarius! should relentless malice, Afraid to touch thy sacred head, stop short In it's mid course; let thy Marcella know My dying thoughts were fix'd on her—My son! O fate!—But hence vain murmurs!—This embrace— Receive my gratitude, affection, duty. May the just gods thro this dark maze of care Lead forth thy steps!—Cherish my memory! To thee, and to the virtuous I bequeath it. Farewell! I go where coward fraud prepares No subtle web, nor violence its chains. Perhaps to mix with heroes; where at least The plagues of this infested world exist not, Self-blinded folly, and wide-wasting vice. [Exeunt. Bel. Dear youth! thy blood alone can ne'er assuage The thirst of hot revenge.—Hapless old man! I should have gone before him—o'er my ashes He should have dropp'd the filial tear.—Alone! Yet not without resource; while still within The voice of conscience soothes oppressive grief. [Exit. SCENE IV. The House of Belisarius. Antonina, Marcella, Junius. Ant. What can detain the lingering step of Caius? He cannot too be false. Mar. Oh! Antonina! Horror and death and treachery are around us; Life is a whirlpool of perfidious wickedness, We, the light straws that float upon the river, Are soon ingulph'd and lost amid it's waves. For me, I wait my dissolution calmly; The death of Phorbas is my fated signal.— My Junius too must perish—O my son The barbarous wretch who triumphs o'er thy father, Will slay thee too. Jun. You shall protect me. Mar. None But tygers, or the pard, would injure thee. But men are brutal, and humanity Dwells in the howling wilderness.—My comfort! E'en in the depth of my affliction! Image Of thy dear father, come into my arms! Ant. Who enters there? Mar. It is the faithful Caius. Hah! if thy face be index to thy soul, Some dreadful news thou bear'st. Caius. Forgive me both! Much-injured, honour'd women! I am destined The oracle of ill. Ant. Say what?— Mar. Are they alive? or— Caius. Belisarius lives. But Phorbas is no more.—As in my turn Of guard, I waited on the emperor's person, Narbal being present, with an hasty step Eumenes enter'd; see, he cried, the sword Which duty brings, stain'd with the blood of Phorbas! So ever fall thy enemies!—Justinian Thank'd him, and they retired. Ant. Will not the earth Ope wide, and swallow them up quick! Ye heavens! Is justice then with you an empty name! That they yet live, and taint the vital air With their pernicious crimes!—Marcella! Hah! Her arms are rigid; and her eyes roll wild. My daughter! heaven forefend?—accursed traitors!— Mar. Come near my son; come near; tread softly tho. Thy father lies here on the couch of death. Jun. Why look you thus? why grasp my hand so hard? Ant. O my dear daughter! what dost thou behold? Thy eye is riveted on viewless space. Alas! she heeds me not.—This did I fear. She ne'er before tasted afflictions cup, And now drinks deep indeed. Mar. Hark! Hark! He speaks. His face is pale; but listen, listen, listen. Wilt not attend to him?—See where he sits! And hear him while he speaks? I could methinks Give ear forever to his honey'd sounds. Listen my son—He'll teach thee to be good— To drive away deceit—to bear a soul Which may be read, as the pure stream is seen Thro the pellucid ice.—I'll sit me down And rest, I have watch'd long. Ant. O friend! in us thou see'st the vanity (To Caius. Of human things. Where's Belisarius now? For thirty years the empire's surest bulwark? Preserver of the universal state? Where is he now? in chains, in a dark dungeon. What is his wife? a wretch who scarcely lives. His daughter? run distracted. His brave son-in-law? Murder'd. The comfort of his age? the boy Of his fond soul?—Oh! my good friend! these thoughts Cannot be borne; fiercely they goad the mind, And shatter every faculty.—Good Caius, Take, lead him forth.—Poor child! thy fate is worst. Thou hast most years to run in this bad world. [Exit Caius with Junius. My daughter! Mar. Stand aside—come not between us— The sun is set—cold blows the evening air. Away ye horrid spectres! Are ye gone? 'Tis well—'tis well. Hah! they are here again. 'Tis Narbal, and Eumenes.—Save me! save me! They wave their swords in triumph.—Where is my lord? Where have ye laid him?—O thou bloody corse! (falling on the ground.) Do I embrace thee?—No—ye shall not part us. Ant. Marcella! calm! oh! calm this extacy! Mar. 'Tis the old tyrant all this while.—(springing up) What would ye? Let go your hold; what, three to murther me! What have I done?—Oh! art thou come my hero? Phorbas shall guard me gainst you all.—Strike on My gallant warrior! there they fall! they fall! Spare him! no—kill him tho he grasp thy knees.— Plead'st thou thy hoary hair old emperor! The hair of Belisarius too was white As the fine-sifted snow.—Kill Narbal first— O traitor dog! triumph! and victory! Oh! well didst thou acquit thee—let me strain thee With close embrace to my applauding heart.— Who hath done this? who hath removed the bodies? My Lord! my Lord! nay, wherefore dost thou shun me? What folly's this? nay, I shall overtake you. (running out, Phorbas meets her.) Hah! who art thou? and whence? Phor. Gods! is it thus? Marcella! Lo! thy Phorbas! Ant. Can it be? Mysterious providence! my son!—behold The poor Marcella!—Joy and grief will urge Me too to frenzy.—O my son! my son! How didst thou?—Yet I ask not—unto her Be all thy care directed now. Phor. O agony! What dost thou hear? Why dost thou dart thine eye Swift thro the vaulted space of yonder heaven? Mar. Music! sweet music! Hist! 'tis here—'tis gone, 'Twas joy pass'd by upon a rapid sun-beam! A Love bestrides each dancing mote—they haste To Theodora—have you heard the news? The good Justinian sleeps in earth, and Narbal Is now the jolly bridegroom. Phor. O ye powers! Here look with pity! view your sweetest work! Restore! restore!— Mar. Silence! Revenge hath pierced Her heart—the shaft sticks deep—despair Hath thrown his cold and frosty arms about her. See! madness raving, clanks his iron chains, And beckons her to yon high mountain top! She falls—down—down—it was a desperate leap. Phor. Heart-rending sight! my trembling knees would sink Did not the thoughts of vengeance yet support me. Oh! I will let it loose.—Thou dearest woman! Look on me!—Now ye gushing streams pour down! Empty your fountains! for I would within Keep nought but fire. Mar. Why weep you? have you lost A darling husband you? and you a wife? Oh! I could tell you such a tale of woe— But I can bear misfortunes manfully. Yet weep—weep—for my eyes refuse their office. I'll save your tears, and pour them o'er his tomb— For he was worthy— Phor. Oh! no more, no more. Lest I take root e'en here; or turn to stone By thy all-potent magic petrified. View me Marcella! Know'st thou not thy husband? I am thy Phorbas. Mar. Oh! I know thee well.— Thou art the ghost of Phorbas—do not weep— I soon will come to thee.—Hist! I will tell thee What thou know'st not; grim death is overwearied, And Narbal hired, his place supplies—the gods Look down with fear, and tremble in their heaven. Would I could weep! my eyes are scorch'd and dry, And not a single little drop will flow At my desire.—But art thou he indeed! Art thou my Phorbas! As I am alive Thou shouldst be he; none of the sons of men But he, e'er wore that look humane, or beam'd Forth from his eyes the soul-bewitching ray Of mild compassion.—Oh! my head is giddy. I prate I know not what.—Is my boy dead? Poor little Junius dead, that thou thus weep'st? I'm all in error Phorbas—tell me, tell me, Is my boy dead?—My starting tears now flow, And I will shed them o'er his grave forever, Like ill-starr'd Niobe. Phor. Weep on—weep on. Oh! blessed be the dawn of opening reason! He lives Marcella; I am he indeed; Thy ever-loving husband. Mar. So thou art.— But did Eumenes' sword pierce deep? The wound Was desperate.—Who was thy kind surgeon? who? Oh! let me know, and I will follow him A thousand miles on my bare knees to thank him. My mother!—Oh! but Junius then is slain— The son, and not the father.—Bloody Narbal! Could nought suffice thee but the infant's death? A mother's curse upon thee!—Fly! fly! fly! Narbal and death still dog us at the heels. What! linger you? Phor. All will be marr'd again.— Support her Antonina; lead her in. Thou hast behold thy son Marcella; he Is well, and wishes to embrace thee. Mar. Nay, Deceive me not I pray you. I am a woman, And very credulous.—Weak—weak too—thank you. I have supported you e'ernow my mother, And will whene'er you need. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Before the House of Belisarius. Caius. Alas! what miseries involve the house Of Belisarius! Like a towering oak Which many a year had braved the storms of heaven, Yet rooted deep, magnificent in age, He stood but yesterday; to day an earthquake Hath loosed his roots, he falls, and with him falls The ivy, and the vine with tender foliage Curling around him. (Enter Phorbas.) Gracious powers! 'tis he! It must, it is reality.—Oh! say— Alive! at liberty!—By what rare accident?— Phor. My time is precious.—Know that to Eumenes Was given the mandate for my execution In darkest privacy.—I stood prepared. When he with voice indignant fired the guards, Who urged me to escape. One only murmured, A wretch long used to Narbal's cruel deeds, A stern assassin. Him the sword dispatched. And by the postern door I sought these walls. Caius. Which my unguarded zeal had reach'd before thee. Phor. Blame not thyself. It was the zeal of friendship. Caius. Too rough, and blunt my speech. Ah! how Eumenes, Could I believe— Phor. No more.—Attend! I mean Tho to his Empress' arms he fly for shelter, There to pursue, and sacrifice this Narbal. Go thou with winged haste to old Nicanor, Bid him with utmost speed direct the veterans By different avenues to gain the forum; There will I meet and head the sacred band. Caius. My speed is needless.—Lo! the warrior comes! Enter Nicanor. Nic. Why loiters Phorbas in these paths of danger? Before Eumenes' trusty messenger Disclosed thy fate; my mind, as if with his Holding free intercourse, had all things ripe For some great, glorious action. Phor. How consent Time and occasion with thy generous purpose? Nic. Already discontent with murmuring sound Hath pass'd thro all our streets, and now the voice Of bolder indignation rises high. The people gather all in groupes and clusters Haranguing one another; tho their clamours Are intermix'd, and all among them speakers, They aim at one sole end, to storm the palace, And rescue thence the hero they adore. My veterans all are ready, at a moment We join their bands, and give to tumult, order. Thy freedom is the best, most prosperous omen, Insuring our success. Thy youthful presence Will make us who already are prepared, And dreadful to our foes, invincible. Phor. O noble friend! and worthy highest praise! How I revere thy venerable age! Then Belisarius shall again behold The all-chearing sun, and vindicate his actions In its meridian splendour. Nic. Shall he not? Yes; or these hairs of dry antiquity Shall be trod low beneath the reveler's foot; And courtly sycophants with silken smiles Shall mock these wither'd limbs.—O son of him, Whom I these thirty years have call'd my friend, Whose new-strung arm I saw like lightning blast The Huns' fierce van! Haste! lead us, lead us on! The step of age shall follow swift behind, And in this cause of justice, more than emulate Thy youthful ardour. Phor. Where are posted now The reverend sons of war? Nic. All in their arms; Received in friendly houses in the forum. They wait the trumpets' sound to call them forth. Their heads are hoary, but their valiant hearts Shall urge them on to raise a dreadful storm, Like winter, when compelling all the winds He rolls in wreathes the fleecy snow before him, And desolates the fields. Phor. Thou brave old man! Thy spirit rouses mine to rapturous daring! Haste! call them forth! march down the open space By yonder temple; there I mean to join them. I, in disguise, shall to the virtuous priest, Who is my friend. Nic. I go. The word is justice, And the thrice-honour'd name of Belisarius. [Exit. Phor. Thou Caius to the palace; be it thine To act as thy own reason dictates there. Be mindful ever of Eumenes' orders. We have our friends amid the guards. The time Requires all speed.—Thy asking eye inquires For those within. Marcella is recover'd. I left her wrapp'd in sweetest sleep. Farewell. She too may need thy aid. Caius. May heaven protect thee! And crown thy head with victory and glory! [Exit Caius. Phor. O vengeance! whether by the side of Jove Thou sitt'st, intently gazing on his face, Watching his frown, to snatch the fiery bolt From the crook'd beak of his imperial bird! Whether thou ridest along the sultry sky, While pestilence and famine yoked, draw on Thy livid car, and death with eager joy Hastes close behind! Whether amid the ranks Of homicidal Mars, thy two-edged sword Thou surfeitest with slaughter! to my aid Be near dread goddess! In a cause more just Ne'er did thy breath inspire the human soul. Beneath thy tutelary care I move. Fill all my breast! with more than mortal vigour Brace up each sinew! that from this day's actions Guilt and successful villainy may tremble Mid the bright blaze of their prosperity! [Exit. SCENE II. An Apartment in the Palace. Nar. Rise they in arms! the shallow populace; Or is it but some vain and idle rumours? Or rash and ill-concerted scheme of weak And desperate villains, quell'd as soon as plann'd? Yet wherefore then these terrors! Such commotions Fann'd to a flame, have oft whole states consumed, And laid strong-built authority in ashes. Enter Decius. What of these tidings? Dec. Ruin and despair.— Thro every street sedition pours amain In torrent streams. The name of Belisarius Acts as a potent charm to stir men up To boldest acts of treason. Nar. Head the guards! And join to them thy forces from the suburbs. Go in thy strength, and e'er it gains a leader, Crush the abortive mutiny. Dec. No storm Of common violence impends; I saw Nicanor and his veterans thro the forum Slowly proceed; upon their faces sit Dire rage and intrepidity. Nar. Away! Collect thy troops. Dec. They are already posted Before the palace gate. The guards are doubled. Nar. Confusion! doth Nicanor head the crew? And guide their frenzy?—Yet e'er they advance, Fly! hither bring Marcella! Times like these Uncommon deeds demand: Lead to the prison Junius and Antonina—Pity bids us. That they may see, and comfort in his sufferings Him whom we labour to restore to freedom. Of this be mindful.—Hostages like these Are guards and armies.—To Marcella's ear We shall our actions vindicate. The blame Is all Justinian's.—We advised to spare The life of Phorbas. Dec. I obey thy orders. Nar. Yet stay.—Marcella is endow'd with beauty, Might steal an hermit from his solitude, And make him mingle with the world again. Dec. She is most lovely. Nar. Beauty sways not me. A toy to please light minds, mere glittering tinsel. But by her husband's death— Dec. I see thy purpose. And was she not with hatred and resentment Against thee bent—Besides her grief is young, And now usurps dominion o'er her soul. For much she loved.— Nar. She loved ambition, fame, Greatness and pageant state. So do they all: The real objects which the sex admire; These, when enforced by flattery are resistless. Much did she love; but who pretends to guess How far the soul of woman may be moved; By nature form'd in her fantastic mood, They veer for ever, and are often won To what is deem'd impossible.—With speed Conduct her hither. [Exit Decius. Nar. Now to search her heart. Can I not raise her to the height of power? Can I not swear? unswear? restore her father To wish'd for freedom? to his wealth and honours? Boast with what zeal I strove to save her Phorbas? Act as the guardian genius of her son? Desperate their state and mine.—By this alliance Both are secured beyond the stroke of fate. Thou with thy oily tongue, Hypocrisy, Assist my purpose! In my eyes light up Thy honest-seeming taper! O'er my face Spread be thy tints, well-taught to emulate The hue of virtue! On thy downy wings Let me insinuate my winding course! Glide through each obstacle! and rest at length On the fair swelling bosom of success! [Exit. SCENE III. The House of Belisarius. Marcella, Antonina. Mar. My Phorbas safe; of his dear life assured; I rise superior to each human ill. And all my soul with fortitude inspired, Contemns malicious fate; and prompts to deeds Transcending my weak sex. Despair is pass'd. I feel new hopes, and every thought looks forward To brighter days, to more auspicious times. Ant. Did I not tell thee thousands would arise, Armies conspire, to aid in his distress Thy godlike father? and avenge injustice? Enter Decius. Mar. Why enters Decius with unbidden step These hallow'd walls? Dec. No enemy I come, Or secret spy. If heretofore I err'd, If my rash tongue offended, let repentance Atone the fault; and by my future deeds Judge my sincere respect. Mar. Hath fear then seiz'd thee? Art thou alarm'd? Doth Narbal's base heart tremble? Is it to deprecate revenge thou comest? No; let it take its course. The people's voice, Like that of some divinity, calls loud For punishment upon his head and thine. Dec. With temper hear me. Not impell'd by terror, But to uplift the fallen, console affliction, Am I by Narbal sent. Fenced round by arms, And strongly guarded by imperial power, What can the giddy multitude against us? For thee Marcella, Narbal is alarm'd; For thee he feels, and for thy widow'd state. Guiltless of Phorbas' death, he only begs To undeceive thee, and with friendly heart Take thee to his protection, Mar. Undeceive me! No; never will I meet his hateful presence. Dec. Then must I gently force thee to the palace. Thee Antonina, he in kindness suffers To visit Belisarius in his prison. Go, with the tender Junius.—Let thy tongue With soothing accents cheer the hero's soul; And elevate with hopes of speedy freedom, So he exert his influence to disperse The irritated multitude, and order Nicanor and his veterans to retreat. Ant. Shall I destroy our only means of safety? Mar. Oh! never may thy tongue belie thy heart! Or a breath issue from thy lips to check The surging billows which shall overwhelm Deceit and cruelty!—Lead to the palace, Thou servile minister of him who sent thee. I to this odious interview. While thee (to Antonina.) A sad, but not ungrateful task awaits. Tell Belisarius that his daughter strives To follow with unequal pace his footsteps. Reason again may shrink beneath affliction; But while my mind it's sacred dictates hears, Misfortune's iron hand, howe'er oppressive, Shall nought avail to turn it from it's course Toward honour's dome, and the pure shrine of virtue. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The Palace. Eum. The present is an awful dubious hour, Of dread suspense, and pregnant with the fate Of deeds mysterious. May no envious chance Render their birth abortive!—Still I move With unsuspected feet.—O Belisarius I dared not e'en to thee intrust the secret Of Phorbas' safety; dare not trust thy own. Heroic mind! whose virtue will not swerve From its exalted course! In prosperous hour, Or in adverse, most singularly great, He follows his sublimer plan of conduct; And walks, in these degenerate days, alone; A bright example to the inferior kind What man should be; a creature nobly-form'd, Of spotless elements, and half divine. But scrupulous exactness doth not suit This vile, base æra; this adulterous age Admits not purity unmixt, unstain'd. In seasons rank like these, what else were vice, Is become virtue Mutiny, rebellion Cast off their odious vestments, and are dress'd In robes of comeliness, and real grace. Enter Caius. What means this pallied hue? this face of horror? Caius. Oh! I have seen, what, like Medusa's locks Might rivet me immoveable to earth. When will the hand of persecution cease? The measure of calamity be full? Eum. What hast thou seen? Caius. Alas! with rancour swollen, This low-soul'd caitiff, his destructive snares Spreads not for men alone, the weaker sex, The hapless infant, his fell rage pursues. The aged dignity of Antonina I saw by Decius to the prison borne, With the young hope of Phorbas; while Marcella With looks of woe, thro' which shot orient beauty, And conscious greatness, and insulted worth, By Narbal met, was led to his apartment. Eum. What wills the monster? with what new designs Teems his prolific brain? He thinks perchance By these loved objects to avert the blow, And shun the people's fury. Caius. Rather say As the fierce panther tears the harmless flock, These are the fated victims of his malice, And savage cruelty. Eum. Where slept our caution? Why did we plant not an encircling band Around their sacred walls? Why did not Phorbas Remove them from the threatening arm of danger? Not leave them thus defenceless to their foe? Caius. Occasion hath not smiled upon our purpose. Neither could Phorbas ward the sudden blow, Scarce safe himself, and in disguise compell'd To join Nicanor. Eum. Let us watch with care The step of opportunity.—He comes To crush oppression, and revenge his wrongs.— Still sound the guards; and with our chosen number Seize we the lucky instant to forsake The dastard slaves who sanctify injustice. Should Phorbas fail, should Belisarius perish, Better with them to die, than mid a crew Of tainted lepers catch the dire disease, And linger on a hateful life with them. [Exeunt. SCENE V. An Apartment in the Palace. Narbal, Marcella. Nar. Let not the frown of scorn usurp that brow, The seat of mild complacence; in these eyes Let not pernicious anger light his fires, On me they ought with gentler beams to shine. Mar. On thee! O patience heaven! Nar. On me Marcella, Who eager strove with ineffectual zeal To save thy Phorbas. My advice was mercy. Mar. Dost thou blaspheme with thy unhallow'd tongue, Prophane and impious, the sweet name of mercy! Coeval daughter of the eternal mind! With whom, and Themis sitting far apart Almighty Jove holds converse? Nar. Cease this strain, This idle rhapsody of words, nor soar Upon enthusiast wing too high a pitch. Why should Marcella mingle with the stars, When, on this earth, unless perverseness blast Their vernal prime, the flowers of soft delight May at her bidding spring, and gayly bloom? Mar. To what base purpose, is the gall within, Converted on that traitor tongue to balm? Nar. Hard task is mine; to combat with aversion, And from thy breast that prejudice remove Which blinds thy better sight.—By what persuasion O loveliest of thy sex, shall I convince thee With what warm ardour, even of affection I struggled to preserve ill-fated Phorbas? To Theodora, to Justinian's rashness Impute his death.—Within my tortured soul Pity, respect, and admiration join'd, Felt for his sufferings; it now bleeds for thine. Mar. May I believe thee? Wert thou thus humane? Nar. Witness O holy truth! O sacred pity Speak in these tears which recollection pours At his loved name. Mar. Then have I wrong'd thee much. Thou wert his friend! Nar. I was. Mar. And now art mine? Nar. Cannot Marcella find a softer name? If tenderest love— Mar. Hah!— Nar. Tenderest, truest love— Mar. Traitor, no more.—Already have my ears Too long with criminal attention heard The odious sounds of that detested tongue. Nar. Tho beyond life itself thy charms I prize; Yet not to guess Marcella's lofty soul Towering above the rank of womankind Would shrink, suspecting art, beneath the words Which strike the meaner of her sex, was weakness. Hear then the language of unvarnish'd sense, Of plain unerring reason. Mar. What preceded, Was opposite to these? Nar. The true construction Is, that my love, impatient of controul, O'erpass'd my argument.—Marcella stands By the warm passion unassailable, Hard of access, nor easy to be won; Or, tho dissimulation I abhor, Still thinks me false.—Now reason speaks to reason. Mar. The ways of heaven are just, tho deep conceal'd From mortal sight. Else, O ye living powers! Might I complain, and ask for what offence, What unknown crime, I thus am doom'd to listen To words which shock each feeling of my soul. Nar. Yet hear me; nay, and hear me with attention. Thou tread'st the dark and gloomy path of danger, Which leads to shame, to misery, and death. Pride, anger, and punctilious nicety Impell thy steps.—While riches, honour, power Call thee to share with them their envied state, And rule his willing heart, who rules an empire. Mar. How long! how long must I submit!— Nar. The fate Of all thy soul holds dear on thee depends. Dost thou not wish the freedom of thy father? To see him shining with redoubled lustre In the calm eve of life? To view thy son Received and fostered in the arms of greatness? Till he arrive at that exalted station Which bounds the daring journey of ambition? Thy mind is moved—thou wilt relent Marcella— These humid eyes foretell the melting heart. Mar. From many a various source may tears descend. But say mine spring from poignant grief alone, Is there not cause? Nar. There is—for thou hast lost One, in whom every rare accomplishment, As in assemblage, met. Faith, virtue, wisdom, Courage and generosity conspired His character to form.—Accursed be those Who told him Narbal ever was his foe! I would have died, I would have died to save him. But nought my words, my suppliant knee avail'd, Fate steel'd Justinian, and I lost a friend— A friend hereafter—when convinced he knew How to one point our kindred bosoms beat, And time, the wounds of prejudice had heal'd. But thy affection, and my grief conjoin'd, In vain would penetrate the realms of death, And bid the disembodied shade assume It's warm and active functions.—O Marcella, Say then, from whom should I seek consolation But thee, the soft associate of his soul? And who with shielding wing should thee infold From the big tempest of adversity, Who lead you all to safety, but his friend! Since he is dead— Mar. He is not dead, thou murtherer! Let thy own coward fears assist my speech To drive the strong conviction to thy heart And wrap it in despair.—He is not dead. Ye thunders! dreadful monitors of wrath! Join your terrific notes! and loud proclaim He is not dead! Like Jove himself he comes In clouds portentous, and assembled storms, To pour destruction on the sons of guilt. He lives! he lives! to punish thee he lives! Hark! hark! [shouts and alarms] and let thy spirit sink within thee! These inarticulate sounds with one consent All join to teach thy ears this awful truth That Phorbas is alive. Nar. She rends my soul. If Phorbas lives, where shall I fly for safety? Or courage whence assume, but from despair? (aside. (Shouts, &amp;c.) Enter Decius. Nar. Say, what import these shouts and dire alarms? Dec. My bands are routed; wild dismay and fear Precede the veterans' steps; here fought Nicanor, There Phorbas urged the raging tide of war. While in the hurry of the fight, Eumenes And Caius lined the party of the foe With a collected squadron of the guards. As he rush'd by, Eumenes cried aloud, “Let Narbal know, wheree'er he hides his head “In vain he'll shun the light'ning sword of Phorbas. “Tell him, my guardian care procured the wings, “With which the youthful hero flew.”—The gate Is mann'd, but with a feeble croud, who seems Ready to join the enemy. Thy presence Is needed to invigorate their hearts, And beat the assailants back. Nar. From Antonina That Belisarius may appease this tumult, What tidings bring'st thou? Dec. She the prison enter'd, Resolved to cherish, rather than oppose His indignation. Should he stoop, she cried, Falsely accused, and with vile fetters loaded, By any deed, to guard from just revenge, Malicious enmity; her tongue should prompt him To nobler purposes, a woman's hand Dash the raised shield aside. Nar. What frenzy this! Heroic greatness!—Blind infatuation. Not to perceive that our controul e'en now Holds in destruction rein'd.—Go, thou, Marcella, For know we deem far other of thy prudence, Excite thy father's speedy interference To quell this mutiny. Disperse the croud, And ye are free as air.—Join thy endeavours; Be thou the herald, to the encompast gate Bear forth his message. Mar. Shall we meanly bargain For freedom? for precarious life? the sword, Which now hangs o'er thee by a single thread, Shall we suspend more firmly? or remove? Shall Phorbas listen to amusive tales? Rely on hypocritic promises? Entangled in thy fatal net again? No; let the hero execute his will. Aid him ye gods! to purge the tainted state, Clear the veil'd sight of injured majesty, Prove his true friend, and crush his bosom viper! Nar. Hence then all pity! every soft emotion! Revenge is our's—her work begins this instant. We will not sit in calm inaction down. If fall we must, not unaccompanied Shall be our ruin.—Perish Belisarius! Perish his name! his race!—Ungrateful woman! Am I rewarded thus!—Haste Decius, hence! His eyes—his eyes—Thou know'st what I would say. (Exit Decius.) Mar. Beyond example barbarous! King of cruelty! Hah!—but thou canst not—darest not. Nar. Never more Sees he the light—ne'er more beholds thy face. Unless perchance ye meet again in heaven. Mar. Where thou wilt never come. Thee the pure gods Reserve for vengeance; thee the fiends below Expect; the realms of Tartarus and Dis. Where thy own guilt with punishment more fierce Than all the infernal furies can inflict, Shall torture thee forever. ar. Be it so. But know prophetic, and ill-omen'd Sibyl, Careless of what hereafter may betide, The present hour is mine—nor think his eyes Ransom his life; my bitterest foe shall die No common death. Stern fate inwraps you all. And e'er this great avenger can arrive, He o'er your blood shall pass to strike at me. Bear her to prison. Mar. Yes, I come my father! But how the dreadful spectacle behold! Blind! Blind!—In thee alas! is virtue wounded, The glory of mortality laid low. Pernicious monster! Oh! my darling Junius! Lend me a portion of thy fortitude, Intrepid Phorbas! (shouts, &amp;c.) Tremble thou barbarian! Near, and more near thy dismal knell is rung. He levels at thy head the flaming bolt, We fall but to accelerate thy doom. (Exit guarded.) Nar. Him too the arrow or the sword may pierce; He too is mortal. (Aside.) Ye, whose hearts are true, Whom loyalty inspires, the love of justice, And hate of treason, follow me your leader! This for Justinian—(draws his sword.) Haste we to the gate! Within these walls, secure we may annoy, Or single out with missile arms the foe. Your pay is doubled. He who Phorbas kills A thousand pieces of the purest gold Is his reward.—Now onward to your posts! And let your warlike shouts resound Justinian. (Exeunt.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Palace. Justinian, Theodora. Theo. We are not yet so lost; our guards are firm. Fly, didst thou say! O word of abject shame! Do I forget my station! Do I yield To womanly despair? Is my cheek pale? Feel I the cold and shivering fit upon me? Let multiplying perils thicken round, Tho Phorbas lives, and thus avows his treason, Tho Caius and Eumenes march beside him, Yet—(Enter a Messenger) (shouts) what portend those shouts? Mess. They are advanced Near to the gate, which they prepare to storm, On either side the mingled shouts arise. Soon will begin the desperate shock; I fear Lest Phorbas— Theo. Hah! is every breast appall'd? Nothing but terror, and the dreaded name Of Phorbas!—What tho he commands without? Have we not Narbal? Claudius? have we not Within, the valiant Decius? Add to these The imperial name, an army in itself? And right, and justice? Add our walls, these towers, To force impregnable? Go, bear from hence Courageous looks, warm hopes, by confidence And fortitude of mind inspired; from me Take thou the gift, impart it to thy fellows. A short resistance will disperse this wild Unthinking croud, or they will soon rebel Against their leader.

Haste! send submissive terms! Crouch to these slaves, who long to spill my blood, Then yield me up, and be content to reign A mock and pageant emperor.—I will mount This instant on the loftiest tower, from thence Should I behold the daring hand of treason Urged by success, roll the fierce tumult on, And penetrate these inner walls; think not I will survive; the honours of my life Shall ne'er be wrested from me but by death. (Exit. Just. Tempestuous woman! Ever violent! Is there an act throughout my lengthened reign Which I have wished undone, from thee it sprang. Too late I rue my easiness of soul, How oft hath fear assail'd my nighty pillow, How oft hath danger cross'd my path by day Of thy procuring!—Might this storm pass by, Thy power is o'er.—This solemn vow to heaven! If not! 'twere vain to strive.—I too can die Resign'd to the awful mandate. [Exit. SCENE II. Before the Prison. (Confused noise of a skirmish at some distance.) Narbal, Decius. Nar. They rush like gaunt and hungry wolves upon us, While our's resist like deer.—All hope is fled. Behind, dismay, and the keen sword of Phorbas, Before us, horrid darkness, fierce remorse, And death.—O pangs insufferable! fallen, Sunk from the lofty sphere in which I sail'd, And eagle-like gazed on the midday sun! Brought level with the dust. Dec. Hence with complaints, Absurd and weak!—Or shall we hide ourselves? Creep into some vile nook? and perish there? No; let us measure back our steps with speed, Meet the victorious foe, rejoin the fight, And dearly sell our lives. Nar. Hold—thro the clouds A ray breaks forth.—Go thou and lend thine aid To Claudius, who maintains the unequal contest, The shatter'd remnant of our troops to bring To the inner court.—Meanwhile this prison guards Our only chance of safety. Belisarius Still lives, tho blind; his family are our's. Them, thro the subterraneous avenue, To the same place will I convey. There urge Thy swift retreat, and leave the rest to me. Dec. I go with speed. [Exit Decius. Nar. Too eagerly my soul The dictates of resentment hath pursued. I should have spared his eyes—that deed may close The mind of Phorbas, bar up each access, And render him inexorable.—No— To save their lives he cannot but relent. And to preserve my own, tho shorn of honours, Is worth each strenuous every desperate effort; Yet they too may be mine.—But should I plan A fruitless enterprize, and baffled fall, Not mean and unadorn'd shall be my death, The blood of glorious victims floating round. (Enters the Prison with some of the Guards.) SCENE III. Before the Prison. (shouts &amp;c.) Phorbas, Eumenes, Nicanor, &amp;c. Phor. My brave associates hail! undoubted wreaths Are our's.—The riven gates, the flying guards Proclaim us conquerors.—Now haste my friends! Within yon dreary walls your general lies, Groaning beneath the weight of shameful chains; Quick burst the door. Eum. (advancing) 'Tis open. Phor. Let us enter! (scene draws) Eum. Darkness! and solitude! Phor. We seek in vain. Distraction!—at the time of thy escape, Was he not here? and Antonina? my son? Eum. They were.—Alas! I shudder at the thought. When I had scaled the battlements, the gate Just gain'd by thee; this way a party fled, And, as I guess'd, by Narbal hurried on. This is his work—perhaps— Phor. Perhaps e'en now They breathe their last.—Thus frustrated! Ye gods! Oh! interrupt not thus our glorious course, By you protected! and by you inspired! Eum. I see it all; from yonder dark recess An arched vault descending, winds along To the inner court; doubtless by that they pass'd, And bore the suffering hero. Phor. Thro the gloom I'll penetrate, should it conduct my steps Down to the very centre. Nic. I will follow. Eum. 'Twere but a vain attempt. A slender guard Not to be forced, may brave an army there. And solid doors of brass too firmly closed, Obstruct the way. Enter Caius. Caius. Oh! horror! horror! Phor. Say, What means my friend? Caius. Alas! thy father views Yon glorious orb no more. Phor. Ye gods! not slain! Caius. Not slain, but rendered blind; a prisoner Who saw the melancholy spectacle, Affirms the fact. Phor. Most unexampled crime! And do we lingering stand? not fly to punish This odious monster?—Let the furies loose! New-waken rage! again my friends assume The front of terror! storm the inner gate! Bring piles of wood! Light the destructive fire! Havock and desolation be our plan! And if we cannot save this first of men, With all I love, all that my soul holds dear, Let universal ruin stamp the day With threefold horror! Nic. Generous youth proceed! One spirit guides us; if we fail to rescue, We amply will revenge thy fathers wrongs. Death or success be our's. Phor. Death to his foes! We, while indignant justice calls us on, Rush to the goal of certain victory. SCENE IV. An Apartment in the Palace. Belisarius, Antonina, Marcella, Junius. Mar. He comes, by honour, virtue, glory led, Triumphant in his might!—Yet once before He rescued me alas! from death my father; From madness rescued me.—O Belisarius! Thou dost not know what I have likewise suffer'd; Wild-roving frenzy, and heart-piercing insult, He will—he must—he cannot but prevail! Bel. Idle your words; your hopes ill-form'd and vain. Are we not still within the power of Narbal? Hath he relented? no—but do not think My voice shall sanctify these deeds of Phorbas. Should he advance e'en hither with success, He, and his lawless crew, protend the spear, And raise a barrier of incircling shields, Think not I'll stain my soul; justice deceived, Is justice still, and I will not resist it. Mar. Are not our wrongs?— Bel. Hah! to revenge our wrongs! Is that the pretext of pernicious treason? And who, when mad rebellion is on foot, And ruffian licence bears down all before it, Shall check them in their violent career? Curb their dire rage? and bid them go no farther? Mar. O Belisarius! Thou art cruel now. Surely thou lovest me not. Bel. Do I not love thee? Thou art the best of daughters. No reproach, No blame Marcella, do I cast on thee. I am not yet so lost to what is manly, But that I can forgive a woman's weakness, And think it amiable. Ant. Self-interest now, Should sway methinks e'en Narbal to preserve us. Bel. So should it ever. But our blood he thirsts for, As thou hast seen. Ant. Most true.—Oh sight of woe! Bel. These arms— Mar. Perfidious, base, unmanly deed! Bel. I stretch these arms in vain.—No longer thus— No longer at a distance— Ant. O most injured! O greatly, greatly wretched! Bel. To my heart! (Embracing them.) There would I strain you, till the vital source Were quite exhausted.—Oh! let this embrace Emphatically speak my warmth of love; All I now feel, all I have felt for you. Most kind! most faithful! tenderest! loveliest! best! Ruin'd for me! ye ever-living powers! (Sinks on his knees supported by them.) Give them, give me the fortitude we need! Let us not murmur at your high disposal Of mortal accidents!—O Jove supreme! Great source of all! howe'er inscrutable Thy universal laws, they must be right. And in some point of the eternal round Of circling years, the virtuous must be blest. Whatever be the cause of evil here, Benevolence must ultimately reign, And all creation hail the bounteous god. (shouts and tumult.) Enter Narbal, Decius, Guards. Nar. Since our most generous offers are despised, And Phorbas deigns no answer to bestow But hostile threats, and fire and sword; away! Bear all but Belisarius to the walls! There placed conspicious, should he still persist, And urge on fury to it's worst extremes, Let the steel smite!—Him, as our last resource Myself will guard. Ant. Ye shall not, shall not part us! Mar. Murtherers and slaves! Begone! Jun. Oh! save me! save me! Mar. (drawing a dagger, and breaking from those who hold her.) This to thy heart!—and let a woman's hand— Nar. (wresting the dagger from her.) Desperate and frantic! Hah! thy stroke hath sail'd— Secure her—Bear them hence.— Mar. Heaven will not fail, Howe'er this trembling arm—Oh torture!— Ant. Keen, And exquisite distress! (They are forced off) [Exeunt with Decius and Guards. Bel. O bitterness Of anguish, inexpressibly severe!— Hold!—Hold!—sink not beneath the dreadful conflict.— Return! return! thy wonted seat assume Firm, patient resolution!—When the soul Of villainy, can struggling bear the load Which guilt accumulates; affliction's force Integrity unshaken should sustain. Nar. Still soaring! thy stiff pride unbroken still! Bel. Nature which form'd the reptile, form'd the bird Of strongest wing. Nar. Thro that affected scorn Yet shall I pierce and sting thee to the heart. Blind! and insensate! couldst thou not have guess'd The chains for Narbal forged, might fit thee well? When to Justinian thy officious tongue Condemn'd my actions, couldst thou not have guess'd That Narbal might revenge too? Bel. Heaven ordains An antidote for every human ill. I thank it's power, and am again myself. Nar. To try that heart—(Enter a Messenger) what are thy tidings? say? Mess. Scarce from the wall had Decius bending down Thy terms delivered, when an arrow flew And pierced his brain.—The guards within exclaim'd Tumultuous at thy orders, and required To bear the family of Belisarius From great Justinian's self to learn their doom; A party for that purpose is detached. Who likewise, at his own request, support The steps of Claudius thither, wounded sore In the late hard retreat, with loss of blood Fainting, and as it seems, not far from death. The rest defend the gate. (noise of falling ruins, &amp;c.) Oh horror! (going to the side of the stage.) Lo! The flame ascends! the massy beams give way! Wide is the ruin scattered all around! They drop their arms—they fly—who rushes in Thro the thick smoke impetuous?—It is he— Phorbas himself—they follow—on he moves Direct with rapid fury—he is here! Nar. Draw all your swords! suspend them o'er his head— And when you see me strike, make sure your work, And emulate the blow. (He stands by the side of Belisarius with his sword drawn; the guards behind with their's ready.) Enter Phorbas, Eumenes, Nicanor, &amp;c. Phor. Here is our destined mark, and this the place To hunt a bloody tyger to the death.— Hah! what do I behold! my feet are nail'd To the mute earth, and terror shakes my frame. Nar. If thou, or one of that rebellious croud Advance a step, he dies. Phor. Quick, bid them halt. Nic. Halt! Nar. We transmitted lately generous terms. They still are thine.—We give the lives of all.— Your honours, wealth, and liberty restore— If thou the palace quit, disband thy troops, Confusion soothe, and quell licentious outrage. Phor. Can'st thou again his visual lamp relume? Accursed barbarian!—But should we retire Where is the surety? Nar. On my word rely. Phor. Thy word!— Nar. Nay then, at once! (raises his sword.) Phor. Oh! hold I charge thee! Saidst thou thy word?— Nar. If thou demur a moment, The stroke is given. Bel. Ye gods! I can no longer Command my silence.—Thou degenerate boy! Who taught thy rash right hand to violate This hallowed place? thus carelessly to sport With royal blood? and haply o'er the world Spread desolation, rapine, savage strife, And jarring anarchy? Phor. Oh! spare thy son! Think what I feel! oh! spare these taunts my father! Bel. Why wouldst thou e'er deserve them?—shall an injury, However great, done to a private man, Cause him to rise in arms? to wield on high The death-denouncing sword? and threaten ruin To the universal state?—Justinian! heaven Preserve his sacred life!—ye pass not here, But o'er this mangled frame.—Couldst thou pretend To guide each furious arm? and when upraised, Direct it where to strike?—young Cæsar dead, And no successor named, couldst thou controul Ambition's sons? eager to claim the throne? And tear their country's vitals? to destroy The goodly structure of these hands? the realm Which our joint labours had composed to peace? Nic. Why should our active swords be charm'd asleep With incantations? Can we save his life By our retreat? No; let us therefore rush Upon the murtherers who engird him round! Bel. Oh! that my words could, like a pointed dart Transfix that traitor!—Hah! and was it he? The brave Nicanor? now, in civil broils Wasting the glory earn'd in many a field Where honour waved her ensigns?—But declare, Speak all, your purpose!—Or have you been seized With epidemic madness?—Say my friends, What is my life, or death!—What just complaint Stirs you against your prince?—I heed perchance As little as yourselves the imperial title, Or farce of royalty.—If e'er Justinian Had play'd the tyrant wantonly, if orphans Were plenty in our streets, and wailing widows, If the whole realm harrast beneath his sway Groan'd for redress, then 'twere a glorious cause To bend against him the strong bow of vengeance, Nor these old arms had fail'd to strain their nerves, Till the points met together. Nar. Ye have heard The voice oracular of truth and virtue, Obey it's dictates; lay your weapons down; And trust my intercession to obtain A general pardon. Phor. Much would I perform To save that valued life. Bel. Why every thought Bent on an individual's happiness? Consult the public welfare.—But not here Lay down your arms; despise with me this wretch, And his commands; laugh his vain threats to scorn; His promises, his very oaths suspect, For falshood hath possess'd his total frame, And mingled with his essence.—Few my days Of ebbing life, should nature take it's course: By what his cruel hand hath ravish'd from me, Still lower in their price, of no esteem, Useless to others, useless to myself.— Leave therefore him to me, and me to him. The sword will fall on unsubstantial air, The shadow of a man.—No; seek Justinian! To him with low submission bend; intreat Of him forgiveness; from his sovereign will Expect your future fate. Nar. Nay then revenge, And hopeless rage no longer shall postpone Their destined task— (going to strike.) Phor. Use the swift lightning's speed! And on his head at least— Enter Justinian and Guards. (Narbal starts and drops his sword.) Just. Seize that detested traitor! bear him hence To punishment! him and the treacherous slave, His fit companion! [Exeunt Guards with Narbal. Hah! do I behold That venerable face despoiled and blind! Vindictive malice! groveling cruelty! And canst thou pardon! oh! I fondly thought At least in some degree to recompence Thy unexampled wrongs—but what can pay This loss sustained!—Marcella! Antonina! Enter Antonina, Marcella, Junius. Ant. And art thou given to our desires again? Mar. Do I then clasp my husband in my arms? Thy boy my Phorbas. Phor. Blessings on his head! Ant. My son! Mar. My father? Bel. O my age's light! (embracing Junius) Young, lovely sun-beam! I could bear adversity, This overwhelms me.—But my sovereign! hah! I hear his grief, the emotions of his soul. Just. And needed I this sight to afflict my bosom Fresh bleeding with another recent wound! Thou know'st not Theodora's fate; alas! When Phorbas had each obstacle o'ercome, And hope appeared extinct, from the high tower Where she was placed, in sudden frenzy, down She threw herself.—Ill-destined, hapless woman! Thou wert too nigh our heart.—Yet heaven is just. Misguided by her zeal she thought thee false, And lived not to be undeceived with me. For the perfidious Claudius is no more, Who in my presence all the plot disclosed, And died, with keen remorse, imploring mercy. Bel. Am I then free from each imputed crime? In thy opinion free? I have lost nothing. Mine is all gain. To this an empire's wealth Is cheap, is sordid. Dost thou know me guiltless? Just. I do, with joy I do.—No power on earth Shall e'er with darkness cloud my mind again. I heard thee as I entered, prime of men! Heard thee with admiration.—Son! and friends Of this illustrious hero! I approve All you have done; yes, my warm heart approves it. Phorbas, thy second self shall reap our bounties Unmeasured as his worth.—While they who shook The sceptre in my hand, shall from henceforth Encompass me, my firm protecting bulwarks.— Friend! guardian! reinstator of my throne! Above all empire! Let me cast aside Vain pomp, and mix myself with native greatness, And strain to thee to my heart. (embraces Belisarius.) Now all indulge Your feelings unrestrained! Your mutual joy Indulge! while I, a sharer in your bliss, Taste truest happiness; with new-born smiles Bedeck the face of innocence; reward Fidelity and courage; and repair, Far as my power extends, those injuries Which from my rash credulity have sprung. Bel. Worthiest of princes!—O my son! be't thine With zealous spirit to serve faithfully This generous master. Ever to his ear Prompt to receive, convey the tale of truth. Ne'er may such goodness be abused by falshood! Nor smooth-tongued sycophants approach his presence! Thorny and rough is the nice path of empire; And who can walk therein with foot unwounded? Truly to search the hypocrite, and view The villain's naked soul, is heaven's alone. Man can but do his best, act from appearance, And rectify the error which is known.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. There are, who when the Tragic scene is past, Require a serious Epilogue at last. “Why raise the sigh, and cause the tear to flow? “Then, strive to banish every trace of woe? “Why elevate with moral truth the breast? “Then, lower it so soon, to whim and jest? “Thus sense is injured, feeling is disgraced, “The Tragi-comic mixture wars with taste. “If fashion these incongruous strains supplies, “The voice of fashion, genius should despise. “Preserve it's former dignity of stile, “Not close the tale of anguish, with a smile.” These arguments are plausible indeed; But say, will Reason sanctify the creed? First prove the stage, the scene, the actors, real, The story true, the sufferings not ideal. If now, to cherish fancied grief be right, Why two hours hence discard it? Why to night? Why not indulge the luxury of sorrow To morrow? And to morrow? And to morrow? The passions warm'd, and the soft tribute paid— Nature and taste have duly been obey'd. The illusion hath prevail'd, the time is o'er, And truth should reign, where fancy reign'd before. Enough of grief in real life we find; Enough to prove our sympathy of mind. But with the tale of art, dismiss the sigh, And with the fiction, cast the sorrow by. When gathering clouds the face of heaven deform, And the winds rave—how awful is the storm! But who repines, if Phœbus darts his ray? Who thinks the mists too quickly roll'd away? Yet would we not obtrude on melancholy Buffoonery's mask, or the broad grin of folly; For fun and jokes in the low kennel seek, Or raise a transient blush on virtue's cheek. A decent cheerfulness, some strokes of wit We hold that judgment should not deem unfit. Not laughter's clamorous uproar we commend, But would with fashion, reason likewise blend. Thus pro and con the arguments we've given; You must decide; we keep the balance even. Here liveliness—here sorrow—this a sigh, And that a smile of your's can lift on high. It trembles—it descends—'tis your decree; So farewell grief—and welcome gayety. FINIS.</field>
