      <field name="fulltext">Scene I. THE ANCIENT CITY OF NOTTINGHAM BY MOONLIGHT AND F. HOLDING. From unknown designs of the period. Enter Tup-yed, Verjuice, Sniffle, Muddle, and certain of the Watch. Tup-yed. Aye, marry, aye; I know a thing or two. Do what I tell you, masters, and—you'll do. What time is't? Verjuice. Nearly twelve. Tup-yed. Well, that's quite right. It's cold; and I've got mully-grubs to-night. All here? Sniffle. Yes, sir. Tup-yed. Hollo! what's that you said? Sniffle. Master; I've got a bad cold in my head. Tup-yed. Then, tallow your nose, old boy, and get to bed. Now; are you sober? Muddle. Middling. Tup-yed. That'll do. It's quite as much as I expect from you. Middling's the best, they say, for mortal elf. I'm only in a middling way myself. Creep to this corner; it's a bitter night; But, first, toot round, and see if all is right. Verjuice. Except the cold wind, Tup-yed, all seems still. Tup-yed. Then come out of the wind, and hearken Tup-yed's will; Now, masters, listen what I've got to say: Watch well; and mind you do not miss your prey. Verjuice. Don't talk so much; but, if you do,—talk low; And, if you chance to walk,—walk very slow. Tup-yed. Poachers are out; so, nab 'em, if they tease you. Verjuice. But, mind they're little uns, or they'll happen seize you. Tup-yed. As for these Sherwood men,—thus you must treat 'em,— Bolt, when you see 'em, for you cannot beat 'em. But, peep in slyly where folks sit at supper; And,—if they'll not share it,—down upon their crupper; For, if they're eating barn-door fowl, or Cochin, Welch rabbits, or poached eggs;— Verjuice. That's poachin'! Tup-yed. If any rascal takes the midnight air, 'Od rabbit it, take him! The game's quite fair. Game laws, like game, are neither here nor there; The first's a delusion, and the last a snare. These varlets of the town,—if crusty, scout 'em; If big uns,—cut 'em. Verjuice. And, if little uns? Tup-yed. Clout 'em. If you should meet a man that's drunk,—why, stop him. If he'll not stand,—then rap his nut,—and drop him. Muddle. How if it chance to be a cove we know? Tup-yed. Call it rheumatic, then,—and let him go. If, in the streets, you hear a wild uproar, Slip down a entry till the row gets o'er; Then, staff in hand, rush out, like any Turk, And larrup a lad or two,—it looks like work. Verjuice. If rain comes on, now,—it were quite as well To tap at some quiet tap, and get a gill. Tup-yed. So, go your ways; and don't you get too boozy. Good night! Be quiet! I feel a little drowsy. Enter Tremuloso in a tremendous trepidation. Trem. I say! Look out for squalls! The sheriff's here! There's something on his mind that's mortal queer! He's kicked me into fits! I'm nearly melted! He's coming down full pelt, and you'll get pelted! My hair starts up at his outrageous lingo. He'll dust your jackets, by the living Jingo! He's in a ripping rage! There's nought to match it! O crickey! Here he comes! By Jove, youll catch it! Stand back; and give him room. Now for a spree! I'd better hide; or else he'll perhaps hide me. Enter Sir Brian de Bull-beef, his Daughter, Daisy de Bull-beef, and their Attendants. Sir Brian de Bull-beef. Where's this town-watch? Where's Tup-yed? Trem. Now, he'll nap it. Sir Brian. Bring Tup-yed's nob; my fingers itch to rap it. Trem. I thought so. Sir Brian. You be blowed. Trem. I've had my share. Sir Brian. Stand back, you flimsy wretch. I'll comb your hair. Watchmen! They're turnips! And I'm bent on potting 'em. Was ever town worse watched than poor old Nottingham? Like watches, they all go on tick,—none quicker. Daisy de Bull-beef. But, they're not half so fond of watching as of liquor. Sir Brian. Tup-yed; you like a tap. Try that. Tup-yed. Oh—Oh! Sir Brian. Oh—Oh! Was ever table rapped that answered so? Slip-slop. Hit him again; he owes me twopence. Sir Brian. Does he? Then,—here's twopenn'oth more! The knave looks muzzy. You watch a town! Why Nottingham's invaded! By Robin Hood's men we're o'er-run and raided. There's nothing dear that's safe. Our men get routed; Our does get nobbled, and our bucks get clouted. Daisy. And, as for watch,—you might as well be spouted. Sir Brian. There's nought too small; there's nought too hot or heavy; And, they ll leave nought, if we don't stop this levy. Daisy. All's right to them,—priest, poultry, pig, or pigeon. Sir Brian. They care as much for rabbits as religion. Daisy. They nab the clergy, and they strip and beat 'em. Sir Brian. They've stolen my cattle; and, no doubt, they'll eat 'em. Daisy. And, t'other day, at noon, as I'm a sinner, The rascals ducked our cook, and ate my dinner. Sir Brian. Tup-yed,—you knave,—of tups you are a topper! Come here! I'll give that pipe of yours a stopper! So, nap no more; or else, you'll nap it handsome. Slip-slop. Maister; aw've clogs on. Mun aw goo an' punce 'em? Aw'll wakken 'em,—yo'n see. Aw will, for sure. Aw'll warm their shins a bit! Sir Brian. Get out you boor! Catch me this Sherwood knave, and dust his jacket; If not, there's not a nut here, but I'll crack it. This jack-a-dandy of the woods,—called Robin Hood! This forest buck! This beau! I'll have his blood! I'll make a bonfire of his bows and arrows; And hang the rascal up to frighten sparrows! Daisy. Oh, pa! Dear Robin Hood! Sir Brian. Oh, stuff! I've been hood-winked too long, you little muff! Daisy. Nay, pa, dear; don't be angry at poor Robin! Sir Brian. Pa-a! Pshaw! Get home, you jade, and mind your bobbin! Daisy. Pa, dear; I'm shocked to hear how you do carry on. Leave him to me; and pitch into Miss Marian! Slip-slop. Thi feyther says thae munnot be a foo! Daisy. Get out; you saucy lout! Who spoke to you? Do, spiflicate Miss Marian! Pa, dear, do! Sir Brian. Silence, you minx! I'll shoot him, roast him, baste him! Daisy. You'll cook his goose! And I shall never taste him! Sir Brian. So, sleep no more, you knave,—but go and do it; And do it soon,—or else you soon shall rue it. But, hold! My bow has got another string! This business shall be laid before the king. Exit Omnes with the new intention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene II. ROBIN'S ROOST. D. Horn. Robin discovered asleep. Robin. Well flown—good shaft! Again! again, my lad! He'll nick it, now! Out, out! you'll drive me mad! Will Scarlet! Allan! Hand my bow, my boy. Marian, my darling! Are my stockings dry? Oh, this wild life!—A tanner? Stand aside! I'll bet a tanner that I tan his hide. Another staff! Here, Much; a bout or two; And, beat him; or I shan't think much of you. Fill up! Let's dance a round. It's getting cold, Licked! Licked again! That fellow's good as gold! Oh, this wild life! The vision of Aurora, the Fairy, the Queen of the Morning Star. Fairy Queen. What, Robin! Sound asleep? This will not do. Sleep may be good for watchmen,—not for you. Bold rangers of the forests, wild and wide; The Saxon freeman's bulwark, and his pride! Hawks are abroad; sharps, beaks; and wild wings flapping: And, they'll be felt, too; if they catch thee napping. Thy Marian, dear, by hunters is surrounded: Wake up, my buck, or else thy doe'll be pounded! But, know, brave forester,—when dangers lower, I will defend thee with my magic power! RECITATIVE. “Thy friend am I; wherever thou do'st range; My woodland sovereign ne'er shall want for change. Take this! 'Twas wrought by an unearthly hand: And, at a pinch, will bring me down from fairy land: Or,—if you like,—when things are looking ill 'Twill wisk you to my magic halls, at will.” So, Robert, we're on visiting terms, you see, Send me your carte. Adieu! Remember me! The Fairy Queen disappears mysteriously. Robin (starting up). Hollo! my bounding bucks! Will! Allan! John! What, lads! Wherever are the fellows gone? My harts of oak! Will Scarlet! Will; I say! If ever I've a snooze, it's just the way. Will Scarlet! John! Enter Will Scarlet and Little John. Little John. Hollo! Robin. I said “Hollo!” I've hollo'd till I'm hollow as a drum, d'ye know; Where's Allan? Where's the miller's lad? and Tuck? Little John. Tuck's tuk French leave. Enter Tuck, with a capon on a fork, followed by Allan-a-Dale, and Much, the Miller's son. Tuck. Not I. It's roasted duck. Robin. Oh,—aye? It's a tuck in you're at, I see; No wonder, Tuck, you tuk no heed of me. Little John. Tuck in, Tuck, lad; and sweet be thy repast! Robin. Let him tuck in;—he'll be tucked up, at last. Tuck. The ale was muddy; and the cheese was Dutch: The duck's an old un; and,—I've tuk too much. Robin. But, tell me, friar, Is there a fire? Tuck. A good un. Allan-a-Dale's just clapped a lot o' wood on. Robin. No time to cook a rasher or a steak on? Tuck. Time! Time i' faith! we've far more time than bacon. Robin. Ho! So, you're here, at last! Well; lend your ears! Let your tongues sleep; and waken up your fears. There's danger in the wind! We're hard beset! Be sharp, this whet, or else, it's heavy wet! Flit to the Knarl-wood glade, my merry men! You know the spot. It's near the willow glen. By stealthy windings, to that place repair; And,—when the moon is up— Little John. You'll meet us there? Robin. No, I'm engaged, just now. Guess who I've seem. I've had a visit from the Fairy Queen! A queen! Oh,—such a doe! I doat upon her! That face! That form! Oh,—lads! The queen's a—stunner! To th'fairy Windsor she's invited me; So, I've a friend at court, at last, you see. She's made it easy, too; for, in this thicket, She gave me,—never mind; its just the ticket! By royal train, through realms of air I fly. I've got the queen's free pass. So, now, good bye! Tuck. Can I go? Robin. Go? No! The queen is chary. The company's select in regions airy. My merry men; be off! Absquotulate! It's near her tea-time. And I'll not be late.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene III. THE GOLDEN GROTTOES IN THE RADIANT REALMS OF THE SUNBEAM FAIRIES. (T. Grieve.) The Fairy Aurora discovered. Fairy Queen. What; Robin here? Robin. Immortal lady! yes. Queen. What brings my bowman to these groves of bliss? Robin. Your kindness, madam, hath so touched my heart, Nought but your presence could relieve the smart. To thank you, lady, for your gracious care,— 'Tis that which brings me from the woodlands here. DUETT. Air—“Tyrolean Waltz.”—Robin Hood and the Fairy. Meet me to-night, Whilst bright stars are shining And sweet bells are chiming, Whilst gay nymphs are smiling, Whilst faries are dancing, Sweetly, softly, sweetly, softly, Meet me to-night. Whilst watch bells are ringing, And roses are springing, Whilst love birds are cooing Together and singing, Sweetly, softly, sweetly, softly, Meet me to-night love. Robin. Fair queen of faery! Deign to smile again! I'll quit the forest wild; and here remain. The little archer's laid your archer low. I'm all a-quiver; let me bend,—your beau! Queen of my heart! Your faithful henchman see. Allow a bowman to salute your majesty. Queen. Stay, stay; bold forester! And learn thou this; The shaft of love, for once, hath hit a-miss. I know, full well, the pranks you woodmen play; But, don't attempt such frolics here,—I pray. Our court, at least, shall teach this fairy nation How to live happy without low flirtation. True bliss, and purity, are close connected; So say no more! Robin. Madam; I stand corrected. Queen. And you're engaged. Or else,—I hardly know;— It's better not. Indeed,—it can't be so. Away,—away! To th'rustling woods again! I'll shield thee, Robin, and thy merry men. If ever foemen threaten, do not doubt me; My fairy bands shall camp unseen about thee. Song—“Come, Love, Come.” Composed by James Edmond Walker Come, love, come to the trysting-tree; Your step is light and your heart is free. The rosy morn bedecks the hill, And bright beams gem the murm'ring rill. Come, love, come to the flow'ry heath; I'll gather thee a virgin wreath, And like the birds we'll flee away, As merry and as free as they. Come love, come, &amp;c. GRAND FAIRY EVOLUTIONS AND BALLET.

      <field name="fulltext">Scene IV. THE EXTERIOR OF THE KING'S PALACE. Enter, cautiously, Friar Tuck and his pals, on a party of plunder. Tuck. I can't stand this! I'm hungry! Hal. So's this child! The state of the interior's getting wild. Tuck. This mortal day we've spent in fruitless forage. Clare. Without a mouldy crust, or scrape of porridge. Tuck. We're in a scrape, lads; something must be done; This dog of mine keeps howling for a bone. “For, I have that within, which passeth show,—” Hal. Can't say that I have. Mine's gone, long ago. Clare. I've been so long without, that this I know,— I'm croaking, now,—within an ace or so. Tuck. Animal spirits cannot stand their ground With beef-steaks at eleven-pence a pound. As for Long Parliaments, an' th'Commonweal,— Short commons are too long. I'm longing for a meal. Clare. A pound o' steaks would come in weel for me. Hal. We've no stake in the country, that I see. Tuck. Lads; it's no joke. I'm not much used to famine; I can't stand gammon when I'm short of gammon. We've had one famine,—borne beyond belief; And ne'er such famine met with such relief. I must have something to maintain my prowess,— Black-puddings, lobscouse, tripe, or Owdham brewis! It's getting too bad! This life, on my soul, Will not do for me; I don't like a hole Where dinner should be. Clare. Not me! Hal. Nor me! I don't like a hole Where dinner should be. A fig for the house That's hungry and dry; Where every mouse Has tears in his eye. Clare. His eye! Hal. His eye! Where every mouse Has tears in his eye! Clare. Tuck; here's the palace! Let's get in! We'll try. Knock; and see what the porter's like, old boy. Tuck. All right, my lad; all right! Leave that to me! If he comes out,—I'll take him in,—you'll see. (Tuck knocks at the King's portal.) Hollo! Gruff. Who's theer? Dost want to knock it deawn? Tuck. How go? I thought I'd call, whilst I'm in town. Gruff. Who is't? Tuck. It's Jemmy. Come out, an' thae'll see. Gruff. O' reet! aw'll come. (As Gruff slips out the outlaws slip in, and secure a cheap breakfast). Tuck. That's so much worse for thee. Gruff. (Looks at Tuck.) Let's see. Aw connot recollect. My mem'ry's bad. Tuck. Aw getten owder, sin aw wur a lad. Thae knows owd Roddle? Gruff. Roddle! Sure; aw do! Tuck. Then, sit tho deawn; an' dunnot be a foo. Let's have a wag! How arto gettin' on? Thae doesn't look so weel. Here; sup, owd mon! Gruff. Well, come; here's luck! Tuck. Here's th'same to thee! Cheer up! Tak howd again, owd brid! Thae doesn't sup. Air—“Rich Red Wine.”—Friar Tuck. Come, sup this, lad—'twill do you good, And cheer you more nor water; You'll find it good—both drink and food; It licks prime bottled porter. 'Twill make your spirits light and glad, So pour it down your throttle; There's nowt gives one the dumps so bad As an ugly empty bottle. Come, sup this, lad, and don't be sad; Drinking makes the heart feel glad; So, drink it up,—drain the cup,—that's reet, owd lad. CHORUS. There's nowt like wine for mon to sup, It makes their e'en like rubies shine; Fill-fill unto the brim, fill up With rich and sparkling wine. A fig for folk that don't like wine: Gi' me the lad that drinks well. I owe to wine this paunch o' mine, And it helps a mon to think well. How pleasant a thing to feel like a king, Though often your brains you muddle; It makes a mon to laugh and sing— There's nowt like a jolly good fuddle. Come, sup this, lad, &amp;c. Heaw arto gettin on, owd lad? Gruff (muddled). O'reet. Tuck. Here; sup again. It's thy turn. Gruff. (Sings.) I'm a bottled porter! Tuck (Aside). Thae will be directly, owd lad! Gruff. (Sings.) I'm a man of mettle! Tuck. Nought else, owd lad! Thae'rt gettin' quite a-wag! Gruff (being screwy). Aw mun go back, or aw's be gettin' th'bag. Tuck. Now; thae'll remember what aw said? Gruff. O' reet! Tuck. Aw'll tell 'em that aw've sin tho. Gruff. Do! Good neet! (Gruff retires, and closes the gate after him.) Enter, hastily, Sir Brian de Bull-beef, Daisy de Bull-beef, and suite. They knock at the gate. Sir Brian. Hollo! Porter! Hollo! The knave's asleep! Gruff. Aw'm comin'! What a racket thae does keep! Who's theer? [Grand flourish heard. Enter Sir Loin de Porc and attendants. Sir Loin de Porc. The king! The king! Stand back! Make way, my men! (Pushes Tuck out of the way.) Tuck. Aw say; owd crayter! Don't do that again! Enter, in grand procession, the King, the Court, the Grand Officers (Civil and Military), Heads of Departments, Heads without Departments, &amp;c., &amp;c. (They all salute the King in a manner peculiar to the period.) Sir Loin. Silence! King. My lords and gentlemen,—Once more we're here, To take stock o' the state another year. So, let's to business. Don't look melancholy. I'll cut it short. And then,—we'll all be jolly. I know you fellows well; and, you're all right,— Though none of you, I doubt, are over bright. There are complaints i'th land; but that's a sell! So, never mind! I'm glad to see you well. They say we've suffered from the want of cotton; They say there's something in the state that's rotten. Sir Loin. I can't see what folks have to grumble at. King. But, some of you, no doubt, will see to that. Sir Loin. As for Reform— King. Why; if you've any wit, You'll try, once more, to dodge the thing a bit. You own the lands; and, if you let folks rent 'em, I don't see why you shouldn't represent 'em. They, perhaps, may raise a little brief hubbub; But, wait. They'll soon get tired. Then; let 'em rub! So much for that. No more of this and tother! Let's have a smoke; and let's have no more bother. I think, at home, we're stunning,—on the whole,— And need no change; I do,—upon my soul! And, as for things abroad,—it's thus, d'ye see,— Our foreign minister's upon the spree; So, let that drop, just now. By next October, It's possible he may be getting sober. But, for the present,—all in all connected,— We're quite as well as can be well expected. Then, let's be jolly! Sheriff; what's the news? Old boy; you look as if you'd got the blues. Sir Brian. My liege; if't please you,—hear my sad complaint! Daisy. It really is enough to vex a saint; Sir Brian. And, I'm no saint, although so much embarassed. By Robin Hood, my liege, I'm sorely harassed. If't please my lord,— Daisy. Sire; Robin's not to blame. Miss Marian carries on this little game Sir Brian. My liege,— King. Come, come; I see something's amiss; Don't make a row; and I'll look into this. Lead on! Enter, the Royal Charger. His Majesty mounts, and proceeds on his journey, accompanied by all the Court, and appropriate triumphal music and song. Air—“The Galloping Snob.” Daisy. Papa, when I'm mounted upon my cob, On my cob, on my cob, Sir Brian. The people will think of the galloping snob In “Rotten Row” so famed. Daisy. For as we go prancing through Sherwood ho! Sherwood ho! Sherwood ho! Sir Brian. To the King I'll stick, there's no knowing, you know, What luck there may befal Daisy. To cut that Marian out, Her schemes put to the rout. I'll let her see that to cross me Is to feel the nails of a “Tabby she.” Chorus.—Cantering full swing Ring a ding a ring, The people will say, “there goes the court, The glittering court, to Sherwood O.” Sir Loin. The business we have is very queer, Very queer, very queer; We'd better supply ourselves with beer, Allsop's bitter beer. Sir Loin. The Sheriff he has petitioned us, 'Titioned, 'titioned us; So we'd better proceed without a fuss, Proceed without a fuss. Chorus.—Cantering full swing, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene V. THE FOREST OF SHERWOOD (F. Holding)— Whose intricacies and glades the blades of Robin Hood make their favourite haunts. Robin Hood and his company discovered making themselves at home, as usual. The joys of forest life. Here's,—the woodland trees; The summer breeze; And the buck that roves the forest glade! Oh, its merry in the gay green woods, When leaves are large and long! Robin. Ha! Ha! Bravo, my gallant lads! Well said! We'll drink a toast! Fill up, each jolly blade! Scarlet. Come, Bob, we'll have a song! Omnes. Agreed. A song! A song! Air—“My own, my guiding Star.”—Robin Hood. Oh! I will guard thee, evermore, Nor ever say ta ta; But will defy that ancient bore, Sweet Daisy and her Pa. At poverty thou need'st not quake; Our own fat deer we'll kill; And dine each day off venison steak, Nor owe a butcher's bill. Twelvepence per pound we need not give For steaks, too much by far, Thanks to my lucky star. Enter Tuck, in gorgeous apparel. Marian. Oh, Robin! Look at Tuck! Oh, what a Guy! You've played a pretty rig this time, my boy! Air—“I like to be a Swell.” Robin. Observe, our friend appears in style, In latest fashion dressed— Peg-top trousers, coat, and tile; He's a swell must be confessed. Notice his graceful figure, His Grecian face as well, In corpulence and dress, you see, He likes to be a swell. CHORUS. For he likes to be a swell, To stroll about Pall Mall; Or anywhere, he does not care, So he can be a swell. Friar. Aw think as aw've these swell-clothes on Aw'll tak the town by storm: Tak the Free-trade Hall, and, like a mon, Help th'nation to reform; Spake up for the working class, And the franchise as well; Indeed, 'tis true, that's what aw'll do, But yet aw'll be a swell. Chorus.—Omnes. (The King and his Party are seen approaching in the distance.) Scarlet. Hollo! What's this? We're in for a good thing. Robin. Stand back, my gallant lads; here comes the king! Enter the Royal Party. Sir Loin. The king! King. How now, my forest lads? Tuck. Hooray! King. How goes it with my woodland bucks, to-day? Tuck. Oh, middling,—thank yo. Sir Loin. Silence! Stand away! Tuck. Ston fur thisel'! Aw've moor reet here than thee! Thae'rt noan o'th king. That's very plain to see. Aw wonder that he'll ha' sich chaps as thee. Sir Loin. Silence! Tuck. Gullook! Robin. Oh, Richard! Oh, my king! Upon my knee,— A thousand welcomes to the forest free! For thee we keep these woods; and Richard's will, I, and my bowmen bold, do honour still. King. Rise, Robin, rise! Robin. I cannot rhyme or I would be thy bard; But,—on my soul,—I am thy body-guard. If I could sing, as I a bow can fondle, I'd chant thy noble story,—like a Blondel! Tuck. Th'same here! Sir Loin. Silence! King. Robin; why, thou'rt mellow. Give me thy fist, lad; thou'rt a jolly fellow! I like thee well. There, Robin; that'll do; Omnes. We wish thee luck. King. Good lads; the same to you. Now; let's be merry whilst I've got to stay! An hour's frisk, or so; and then,—away! Well; how goes merry Sherwood, Bob, my boy? Hand me the horn, good fellow. I feel dry. Tuck. Here; sup wi' me, owd brid! Sir Loin. Stand back; you lout! Tuck. Aw say!—Bold Slasher! Mind what thae'rt about; Or else, aw'll gi' that nob o' thine a clout! Robin. All's well, my honour'd liege! (The Sheriff's party is seen approaching hastily in the distance.) Hollo! What's this? The Sheriff, and his daughter? That's amiss! (The Sheriff and his party enter out of breath.) Sir Brian. Ha! Here's a sight to make one's blood run cold. Daisy. I twig! The market's over and,—we're sold. Sir Brian. These forest rogues have got the start of me; But,—by the mass!—I'll,—never mind! you'll see! Daisy. Oh, dear papa; that nasty Marian's here! And Robin looks— Sir Brian. You shut your trap, my dear! Daisy. Pa; What are all these fellows that I see? I wonder Robin keeps such company. Sir Brian. Drop it, I tell you! King. Sheriff; what's the row? I've half an hour to spare. Let's have it now. Who's got a match? Now, Sheriff, blaze away; And cut it short; for I've not long to stay. Sir Brian. My liege,—these rascals— Tuck. Order! Put him out! King. Robin; who's this that kicks up such a rout? Robin. His name his Tuck, my liege; a jolly friar. King. A friar, i'faith! That suits my heart's desire! This raving Sheriff, here, looks mighty curst; I think we'd better hear the Friar first. Let him go on. Give me another light. I say, old fellow! What's your chanting weight? Come; fire away! You'll do it; I'll be bound. Tremuloso. I'll chant him any day for glasses round. King. Now, Friar; go on. Air—“Mouse-trap Man.” Sir Brian. Most gracious monarch—Three poachers you see, Who are the same that so long baffled me; Killed all the game that they came across, In fact, one day they made game of my horse. Robin. What that chap's said is not all quite true; Live in the forest I certainly do; For rest of his story, I do kill the game, Which was made, not for rich, but for poor, just the same. Tuck. And na', mister king, if you'll listen awhile, Aw'll tell ye aw the facts o' this case i' my style; Aw'm nobbut a poor simple friar, d'ye see? But aw think aw con sattle this better nor thee— If yon soft-headed Sheriff will step out and feight, Aw'll match him mysel', tho' aw'm not a leet weight, And well poise his head for a pint or a quart. Say ay, and aw'll say thae'rt a reet down good sort. CHORUS. Sir Brian. So I've brought them here for you to try; They ought to be punished very severely; The law is, in fact, three months by the act, So send them, for that time, to the Old Bailey. Robin &amp; Tuck. And yon false Sheriff, had best mind his eye, Or with my fist I'll let fly. I'll bet a penny, I'll thrash him, or any One else that has pluck or assurance to try. Daisy. Housetraps, housetraps, I fear, Is waitin' to swallow my Robin, my dear. Marian. Your dear he is not, you've helped in the plot To rob me of Robin, and him of his “deer.” Daisy. My revenge on you hussy, will soon be assuaged. Marian. The she cat is not aware we are engaged. Daisy. For when he's in limbo the key I will mind, And we'll fly together, my Robin so “ky-ind.” CHORUS. Daisy &amp; Marian. Housetraps, housetraps, I fear, Is waitin' to swallow my Robin, my dear. Marian., Daisy. Her/Your dear he is not. Daisy., Marian. I've/You've helped in the plot. Both. To cheat me,/her, Of Robin, of Robin, my/her dear. Sir Brian. So I've brought them here for you to try; They ought to be punished very severely; The law is, in fact, three months by the act; So send them, for that time, to the Old Bailey. Robin &amp; Tuck. And yon, false Sheriff, had best mind his eye, Or with my fist I'll let fly. I'll bet a penny, I'll thrash him, or any One else that has pluck or assurance to try. Marian. My liege,—bold Robin and his men are keepers; They watch the woods when knaves like this are sleepers. For you, my lord, they keep the fallow deer; But, they can't keep 'em from this fellow, here,— This gabbling knave that comes now, to complain,— The things he steals they but fetch back again: The rascal— Tuck. Hang up the knave, my liege, and then, you'll find I'd make a sheriff far more to your mind. Or, if your majesty can't do without him,— Just give me leave; and,—by the mass,—I'll clout him. Sir Brian. Clout me? Tuck. Ay, lad; an' soon. King. Hollo! What now? Tuck. Run for mi clogs! There's beawn to be a row! Sir Loin. Silence! King. Come, Sheriff, say your say, my man. I want to get this bit of business done. Sir Brian. My gentle liege,—Your ear I humbly crave. Pray, don't be humbugged by this prating knave. This Friar of Fountains; he's a— Daisy. Lying lout! Sir Brian. There, now, my dear; you've gone and put me out! But still; its true. My liege,—they steal the deer; And keep the country-side in mortal fear. As for this Robin,— Marian. Well, sir; what of him? Daisy. You talk to me, Miss! I'll keep you in trim! Marian. You saucy minx! I'll come and pull your hair! Daisy. Will you, indeed? Then do it,—if you dare! King. I can't stand this! Tuck (to Tremuloso). Keep back; you flickering boor! Hands off! You're only fifteen-spider power! King. Come, Tuck lad; finish off! I'm sick of this! Wire in! I'll soon decide,—and then, dismiss. Tuck. My liege, I think that, now, the case is clear, You've heard with patience this foul Sheriff, here; And you can see how well the knavish elf At every word he says, convicts himself. There needs no more palaver, then, from me, The verdicts safe with you,—your majesty. King. There; that'll do! The thing's quite clear to me. And, master Sheriff,—this is my decree;— I will not hang you now; but, mark, old boy! On pain of my displeasure—mind your eye! [Exit Sheriff and his party, with feelings to be imagined. Now, hook it! Robin, lad; I've done the trick. Robin. You have, your majesty; you've done it slick! [Exit King and his party. Marian. Robin! Robin. Well, chuck! Marian. You love me! don't you, dear? Robin. I do, my darling! Don't! There's people here. Marian. Oh, Robin, dear; you always told me so. Robin. And it was true, my love; right well you know. Marian. Then, oh,—my gallant, handsome forest lad! Do say it once again, it makes me glad! Duet—Composed by G. Crellin: “Come, dearest, come.” Robin and Marian. Come, dearest, come, my heart is beating To roam with thee, 'neath woodbine shades; And give to thee its fondest greeting, Before the placid moonbeams fade. The lowly vales perfumes are sending From every fragrant flower and tree; In dewy gems the rose is bending; Come, dearest, come, all waits for thee. Come, dearest, come, the moon is beaming, Her light is spread o'er hill and vale; While many a heart of love is dreaming, Come, dearest, listen to my tale. No sound is heard save zephyrs sighing, Or liquid sounds from limpid streams. On mossy banks the deer are lying; Come, dearest, come, while the moonlight beams. Re-enter Sir Brian and his Attendants. Sir Brian. I'll be revenged upon that precious lot! Stay; stay; I've hit upon a cunning plot! Tremuloso. Hide! hide! Here's Marian coming through the wood! Sir Brian. Oh, crickey! Now we have her! Come, that's good. Marian. There's a snug covert for the forest deer! A pic-nic would be very jolly here! (They seize Maid Marian.) Help, Robin; help! Sir Brian. Yes, Miss; we'll help you—soon! Robin. Hollo! Strike lads! We'll beat time to this tune! Grand encounter between the adherents of Robin and Sir Brian, when Robin, by the aid of the Fairy's charm, changes the scene instantly to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene VI. THE PINE FOREST OF THE WHITE GNOMES. (A Christmas design by F. Holding.) Sir Brian. Hollo! What station's this? Where are we now? (The Sheriff and his party make themselves scarce.) Tuck. Here's a nice corner for a jolly row! Am I asleep? I'll nip myself and see. No! That's all right. Daisy. Wherever can we be? Marian. A smell of brimstone, too. Can't tell the reason,— But something in these trees looks vast like treason. Robin. Don't put your shoulder out. There's nought to fear. Tuck. I'm glad of that; but it's tarnation queer. I want a porter. Robin. There's no porter here. Tuck. Hail me a porter; or, I'm on my bier. Robin. Tuck; you're beery. Marian. Robert; Is this Belle Vue? Robin. Not it! I take a different view to you. Marian. It's Preston station! Tuck. Nay; not so bad! No! The station next to Preston's—down below. Marian. Robert; are you acquainted with the people here? Robin. Yes, yes! You'll get a cup of tea directly, dear. Tuck. Let's hold a meeting! Let's do something cheerful! Let's have a lark or two! The place is fearful! I don't half like it. Hollo! Here's a swell! Enter, his Majesty the King of the White Gnomes. Gnome King. Gents; how d'ye do? I hope you're very well! Madam! Beg pardon, that I rudely passed you by; The man is blind that has not beauty in his eye. Tuck. Go it my tulip! Robin. Shut up, Tuck! This cove's a king! Tuck. Indeed! Oh; thank you! That's another thing. Gnome King (to Robin). Mr. Hood, I presume? Robin (presents his card). Sir; that's my name. My ancestors were not unknown to fame. Gnome King (looks at the card). A name, sir, that will wrestle hard with time; Robin. Fun, freedom, pathos mingle there,—sublime! The inimitable Tom— Gnome King. Was he— Robin. A relative of mine. Gnome King. Indeed! Give me your hand, sir! I am thine! Tuck. Don't flurry thysel'! Robin. Drop it! you're getting queer. Gnome King. By fairy talisman I'm summoned here. I hold the Fairy Queen's behest in awe. Her will's my pleasure; her command, my law. Tuck. Hoo's a good un! Robin. Tuck; you fool! Be wise! Gnome King. The queen and I are very old allies. On her behalf, bold Robin, here I come. Tell me what I can do,—and I'm your gnome. Tuck. That cove's a brick! Robin. I'll briefly speak the thing. Gnome King. Robin, good fellow; I'm thy white gnome king. Marian. My lord; we're hunted down by mortal foemen! Their toils are round us. See; the knaves are coming! 'Tis the proud sheriff, with his men, and daughter,— Like savage butchers, keen for ruthless slaughter. Re-enter the Enemy. Robin. They're fully bent on Marian's abduction; And,—as for me,—I'm doomed to swift destruction. Marian. Oh, save us,—please! My heart with terror's throbbin' They'll make away with me,—and kill my Robin! Tuck. Give us a lift,—owd brid! Aw'll ston a gill! Iv aw'd bin sober, aw'd ha' licked that lot mysel'. Robin. Aid us, your majesty, to trounce 'em well. I'll take it kindly,—more than I can tell. Gnome King. No more, good Robin! I'm the White Gnome King! Stand by; and see how slick I'll do the thing. What; ho! Brave gnomes that guard these magic halls! To arms! To arms! It is your king that calls! Robin. Ye veteran heroes of ten thousand rows! Another wreath awaits your martial brows! On! on! my gallant gnomes! There stands the foe! Strike home; and put your shoulder in each blow! All gnome-land's gazing on you! Now! Fall to! Larrup the paltry knaves,—till all goes blue! (Sudden and remarkable appearance of the White Gnomes, who, in a singular mode of warfare, peculiar to themselves, inflict on the naughty Sheriff a most overwhelming defeat, and finally congratulate themselves, in likewise a peculiar way.) CHORUS. Air—“Paddle Your Own Canoe.” We've wollop'd the bad old Sheriff, my boys, And beat him black and blue, And after that he perhaps will learn To sail in his own canoe. We hit him once, we kicked him twice, We've given the old file his due, And now we think he'll be jolly glad To paddle his own canoe. So stick to bold Robin Hood, my boys, 'Midst the strife we are travelling through; And let us fight and do what's right, And paddle our own canoe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene VII. GRAND PARLOUR IN THE SHERIFF'S HOUSE.— (By D. Horne.) Enter Daisy de Bull-beef, much to be pittied. Air—“Shelling Green Peas.” Now, list to this ditty of a damsel so pretty, Who in Nottingham city is reckoned “the cheese;” My name it is Daisy; I've a father half crazy, Through often indulgin' in lamb and green peas. He sadly illtreats me, with a broomstick oft beats me; In hopes soon to leave him the young men I teaze; When I goes a-shoppin' I wish they'd be poppin' The question, as smartly as I “pop” the peas. Chorus. —Here, then, you sees, but weak in her knees, A maiden near crippled through shellin' green peas. One day, getting thinner, I said while at dinner, “Papa, dear, do take me the wide world to see; My beauty is wastin', and I would be tastin' The pleasures of love and of matrimony.” Says he, “For your flummery you go to a nunnery, Or out as a governess, if thus me you teaze, In a family that'll snub you, and grumble to “grub” you; And you'll wish yourself back again a-shellin' green peas.” Chorus. —Soon you will see, in “peashusks” to her knees, This Daisy a martyr to lamb and green peas. Daisy. Ah, me; my lot's a dreary one indeed. Time's runnin' on, and so am I to seed. Oh, could I charm some other swain to woo me, Now Robin's turned a frosty shoulder to me; While young Marian—artful creature—'s got the “hot un,” And upon my blissful hopes has firmly put the pot on. What could gentle Robin have seen in her? I'm quite as handsome, and I know I'm slimmer; He must be in a syncope, by readin' Tupper— Good gracious! I've forgot my father's supper! (Prepares supper, and makes a few innocent mistakes.) The peas are not quite ready—never mind, They must go in as they are—love is blind. The fowl must go too, I've no time to draw it, And if it turns out tough, why, he must knaw it. In you go! And there you go! I'll tidy up the place a bit, and then be sittin'; And, when my daddy comes, he'll find me knitting. Enter the unlucky Sir Brian and his attendants. Preparations for consolation. Sir Brian. My child, my love. Daisy. Oh, pa! do mind my dress! It isn't proper. Sir Brian. Oh, never mind your dress, let's have some supper. Hallo! what's this? (cat in the dish). Miaw! Daisy (pathetically). Oh where, and oh where, has that lovely pullet gone? Sir Brian. I'm going to roost. Daisy. Take the pullet with you. Sir Brian. I want my bath. Daisy. Was ever father with his child so cruel? Sir Brian. You idle hussy let me have my gruel. Oh! this is stuff, the worst I ever swallowed. Sir Brian. Oh, this poor pate of mine! Tremuloso. My shoulders ache. Daisy. Oh, pa; I've lost— Sir Brian. What bustle you do make! One fellow's bobbed his finger in my eye. I think no mortal has such luck as I. Tremuloso. My bones are sore. Sir Brian. I've got change for my crown. Tremuloso. Miss; did you see me knock that fellow down? Daisy. No. Sir Brian. Oh, what a world! We've nothing but disaster! Daisy. Run to Will Brown's, and fetch a yard of plaister. And, when we've doctored up his broken head,— Sir Brian. Let's have some gruel; and we'll go to bed. Daisy. And, pa, we'll get hot water for your feet. Sir Brian. Hot water, girl; we're hardly out of that. Daisy. Pa! Here's your gruel. Sir Brian. There, girl; that's the thing! Tremuloso. Sir; here's a message, for you, from the king. Enter Sir Loin de Porc and a Herald. Sir Loin. The king commands the Sheriff, and all here, Before his presence straightway to appear; For foul defiance, reason there to show, Of his decision in “re Hood &amp; Co.” Tremuloso. Oh; here's a go! Sir Brian. We're in for it again. Tremuloso. There'll be a precious shindy! Sir Brian. Nay; that's plain. Daisy. Send for a cab, papa! Oh, dear! Oh, lawk! Sir Brian. Give me a 'bus, girl! We shall have to walk! Air—“London, Chatham, and Dover.” Sir Loin. Now come, prepare, and don't stand there, Your feelings you must “smother,” Like the shareholders who're frettin' ‘Cos they nothing are a-gettin’ By the London, Chatham, and Dover. Sir Brian. Go mad at once I know I shall, With rage I'm boiling over. Daisy. Then bust your biler as is often done Od the Lud-dud, Jat-tab, ad Dover. Trem. Sir L. &amp; Daisy. For his rage I don't care Don't I know 'twill soon be over. For while he's in his tiffy, I'll skedaddle in a jiffy, By the Lud-dud, Jat-tab, and Dover. Sir Brian. Then you may despair, and just beware When I get some straw or clover. I'll see, though I'm tiffy, You don't vanish in a jiffy, By the London, Chatham, and Dover. Trem. &amp; Sir L. Of his rage beware; do, pray, take care, Or with you 'twill soon be over; Trem. &amp; Sir L. I'll see, through his tiffy, You'll not vanish in a jiffy, By the London, Chatham, and Dover. Daisy. (Striking an attitude) Stay! (Chord.) (Mysteriously) Your wits retain, praps the Chamberlain Would like to turn a rover; And if you're all willin', we may get a jolly “livin'” Od the Lud-dud, Jat-tab, ad Dover. In the carriages I'll play on the “ole banjo,” Though the music it will prove a riddle. While— Sir L. and Sir B. We can come out strong with the marrow bones— Daisy. And— Trem. Tremuloso can play upon the fiddle. CHORUS. Daisy. Then I won't despair, for I've lovely hair; And when I become a rover, With my face, black as jet, I shall soon a lover get Od the Lud-dud, Jat-tab, ad Dover. Sir L., Sir B., and Trem. Then we won't despair, but will take care, That now our troubles are over To end our strife and lead a jolly life On the London, Chatham, and Dover.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Daisy de Bull-beef, much to be pittied. Air—“Shelling Green Peas.” Now, list to this ditty of a damsel so pretty, Who in Nottingham city is reckoned “the cheese;” My name it is Daisy; I've a father half crazy, Through often indulgin' in lamb and green peas. He sadly illtreats me, with a broomstick oft beats me; In hopes soon to leave him the young men I teaze; When I goes a-shoppin' I wish they'd be poppin' The question, as smartly as I “pop” the peas. Chorus. —Here, then, you sees, but weak in her knees, A maiden near crippled through shellin' green peas. One day, getting thinner, I said while at dinner, “Papa, dear, do take me the wide world to see; My beauty is wastin', and I would be tastin' The pleasures of love and of matrimony.” Says he, “For your flummery you go to a nunnery, Or out as a governess, if thus me you teaze, In a family that'll snub you, and grumble to “grub” you; And you'll wish yourself back again a-shellin' green peas.” Chorus. —Soon you will see, in “peashusks” to her knees, This Daisy a martyr to lamb and green peas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene VIII. THE KING'S AUDIENCE CHAMBER. The Court in attendance. Air—“Coming Up Stairs.” Sir Loin. The king is a-coming up the stairs (Chorus of boys. Oh Lor!) [Sir Loin.] He's taken me quite unawares. (Chorus of boys. What for?) [Sir Loin.] The door is blocked and double locked, And I can't find the key, Oh! the king is a-coming up the stairs (Chorus. Oh Lor!) [Sir Loin.] With steps both single and in pairs. (Chorus. What for?) [Sir Loin.] Oh! dear, oh! dear, we're done, that's clear. He's breaking down the door. CHORUS. The Court. Shivery, shakery, what a jolly row; Clattering, rattling, wack a row de dow, dow. Shivery, shakery, let us brave it out, boys, And in a lively breakdown meet him at the door. Enter the King. King. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I'm getting quite done up. I'll cut this place, and take a little shop; When I'm in bed, I've not a minute's rest; And the row begins again before I'm drest. A throne! The man who envies it's a fool! Give me a cosy nook and three legged stool! Crowns are unhappy hats. They fret the brow; I'd change mine for a half-a-crown just now? A good soft wide-awake's the thing for me. A crown's a glittering bit of misery. My bacco's done again, too, now I see; I've finished that last ounce they voted me. (Inquiries outside.) There they go again! A Voice. I must see the king. King. Indeed! Oh; Thank you? You'll do no such thing. That's an Adullamite, I'll bet a trice! There's something foolish in the fellow's voice. Oh, what a job to guide this groaning nation, Between first this, then that, administration! Apostate Radicals, and timid Whigs; And Tory-Liberals, with their slipp'ry rigs; Dull dwellers in Adullam's wretched cave,— Who, round a diff'rent—leader,—sneaking rave; And one lot and another. Oh, the pain! When will my country cut the juggler vein? Enter Sir Loin de Porc. Sir Loin. Your majesty,—the— King. Here's that fool again! What is it, booby? Sir Loin. The Milkman. King. Pay him, then. Sir Loin. I've got no money. King. Let him call again. (Exit Sir Loin.) A king; without a copper in his purse! I'm wretched; and a beggar can't be worse. Like a poor donkey, weary of his load; I'll shunt this business,—if I don't, I'm blowed! (Grand shout without.) Now, what's the row! Enter the Wedding Procession of Robin Hood and Maid Marian. King. What, my bold Robin here; and, by his side,— A sweet moss-rose,—I see the blushing bride! Come; by your leave; one kiss. Robin. He's kissed her twice. King. Robin; upon my soul, she's very nice! I wish you all the happiness that life can bring! And,—when you want a sponsor—I'm your king! (General shout of joy, in the midst of which enter, dolefully, Sir Brian, Miss Daisy, Tremuloso, and others, in the custody of Sir Loin de Porc.) Daisy. Oh, pa! Oh, what a sight! Oh, pa; I'm done! Sir Brian. Yes; with her you couldn't stand the test. Daisy. Is this blighted love, or is it the rinderpest? Sir Brian. Get thee to a nunnery! Daisy. What! be a nun, papa? My beauty bury? That's a nun in white in prospect, werry. King. So, master Sheriff; you are here, I see. What means this slight, sir, that you put on me? A little while ago, I felt inclined To let you feel a little of my mind. But, as it's gallant Robin's wedding-day, I'll grace it with a little lenity. So, Sheriff; though I don't forget the crime, I can forgive. I'll let you off this time. Be a good lad; and don't do that again! Now, come and join us in a merry strain. Air—Mary Holder. Daisy. On a most unhappy girl, pray cast your eyes on— Cast your eyes on, cast your eyes on. Sir Brian. Just gaze upon this damsel, oh! a prize one; It's a fact, 'tween you and me. Robin. (To Tuck) She's a very pretty girl, behold her, And she wanted to marry thee. Tuck. No, she said; she wanted a soldier; She could not fancy me. Robin. Oh! Tuck; oh! Tuck, don't say so, With pity behold her; Although you're short in stature, You'd make a very good soldier. Daisy. Cruel, cruel Robin. Tuck. Behold her, how she's sobbin'. Robin. Oh! I do not care a bobbin, Sir Brian. Hush! one on the nose I'll bob him. Robin. Hold hard! my name is Robin Hood, And all I've done I meant for good; So let it now be understood I shall not wed she. Daisy. An intriguing, nasty hussy, is that Marian, Is that Marian, is that Marian; I should like to smash her, like a piece of Parian. Here have I been winkin' and blinkin', Gentle Robin's love to catch; Now for tenderness and blighted love a subject I am for “Colney Hatch.” Trem. Oh! Daisy, raise your gentle head, And take poor Tremuloso. Daisy. Our lackey! well, this is a go I wasn't quite prepared for. Tuck. All the fat is in the fire! Would you like to try a friar? Daisy. (Aside) Oh! to wed is my desire, So I think I will agree, How light that Robin holds her; The hussy's gettin' bolder. I consent for want of better. Friar. Then I cannot marry thee. Enter The White Gnomes, who desire to be in at the finish. Air—“Men of Harlech.” Chorus. Now that all our strife is over, And the game is yours, moreover, Let us share your joyous mirth Of merry Christmas time! (All coming forward with hands to audience.) Accept our invitation, Dear friends in every station, And warm our hearts with lauding shouts To prove your approbation. Your verdict give, and let us live To hear you praise our Transformation; And sound, with heart and voice rejoicing, Praises everywhere. THE GRAND TRANSFORMATION By T. Grieve, F. Holding, D. Horne, and Assistants. Fairy Queen. So, so! I'm here again, my friends, you see One little duty; then, farewell to me! Do change your characters! (General movement of surprise. And mind you mend 'em! For, if you don't, I don't think I'll defend em! Another chance you have to win renown,— As Harlequin and Columbine; as Pantaloon and Clown!</field>
