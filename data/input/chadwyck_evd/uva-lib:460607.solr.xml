      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Soartes, hereditary keeper of the crown jewels. Gonseres, his natural son. Vicente, a nobleman. King. Prince. Courtiers. Zachary, a Jew. Bertrand, steward to Soartes. Appraiser and notary, citizens, soldiers, &amp;c. Judges, Heralds, Ranger, &amp;c. Meranie, niece and ward of Soartes. Ella, sister to Vicente. Inora, mother of Gonseres. Queen, ladies, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. (Scene. 1.) âRoom in Castle. Soartes (solus.) In the adventurous period of my youth, When the steeled sinew and undaunted brow, A bosom strongly garrisoned with hopes, Gave scornful challenge to adversity, She came not near me; now, that I am old, Feeble, outworn, by every hope forsaken, This bitter and ungenerous enemy Provokes her cruel legions to the assault, And all the missiles of her hoarded wrath Hurls at my naked head. Another day Lags on the track betwixt me and my ruin. Is it too late or shall Gonseres triumph? I have still choice betwixt the rags of scorn And the high fortunes of this daring project. Alas! time presses; beggary, dishonour, Meranie wrongedâthe sharer in my woe, All are arrayed before me. Shall I wait In meek forbearance my untoward fates Or by one act, too grasping to involve In its miscarriage vulgar infamy, Retrieve them? (Enter Bertrand with a letter.) Bring you more of news, good Bertrand, And fresh reverses to this aching bosom? A letter, give it me, some lawyer's claim Or griping usurer'sâmy daily surfeit? To the flames with it! Ber. Nay! hold, my lord, I warrant it free of mischief, neither clamorous nor threatful,âa bill of costs nor an attorney's writ. Note you the seal and motto, they are noble and argue well of its contents. Soartes. True, I rcollect them, The count Vicente's, with whose sire I was Familiar in my boyhood. Afterwards, As we grew up, dissimilar pursuits Wrought our estrangement; and it so continued, Until his death, when this, the present count, On some State matter at the king's desire Was sent abroad. (Reads.) âMy Lord Soartes, âI take the blame to myself of forming, unknown to you (it is now upwards of two years ago), an acquaintance with your ward and niece, concerning whose perfections I have more will than ability to discourse. A twelvemonth has elapsed since my father's deathâan event which is remembered by me with the deeper interest from the circumstance of his having in his last moments given kindly sanction to my desired union with the Lady Meranie. Since that period to the present time, I have been employed abroad on State matters, and thus prevented from holding earlier communication with you on the subject. As I am now, however, on the eve of returning to my native country. I make all speed to acquaint you with the bent of my purpose, and only wait your approval, as guardian and relative of the lady, before claiming the surrender of her hand, &amp;c., &amp;c.â âVicente.â Again unfortunate! All of a web with what beside is looming (aside), Hold! honest Bertrand! this one thing you harp on, Justice to Meranie, is now at hand; Here are proposals from the Count Vicente Apprising me of his long-cherished love For my fair niece; moreover, he entreats My countenance to his suit. Ber. Which, as a matter of course, my lord, you will not refuse? Soartes. Three weeks ago, I, of all menâGo, fetch the girl, good Bertrand, But stayâAlas! I have no heart to see her; I have no heart to break my purpose to herâ To banish the rich life blood from her cheekâ To cloud the eye radiant with love and hopeâ I cannotâdare not. Ber. How! my lord, you perplex me. The alliance is desirable. It befits the rank and fortunes of your ward. The Count, it appears, is an accepted lover. In your consent, rests the happiness of bothâthat consent of courseâ Soartes. This is honestyâ Your simple, over-scrupulous honesty, That cannot with both eyes take estimate Or put the brain to service. I perplex you! No wonder Bertrandâbeing myself perplexed! Justice to Meranie! I will be justâ Most just to her. She shall have boundless wealth. The gold her spendthrift guardian gave the winds Shall re-invade its coffers. Wealth! no fear! To the last barren acre, I shall free Her sire's estate. No one, at least, will say âHe has curtailed her dower.â Ber. Ha! a jest, my lord. True, I am owl-wittedâa dull drawer of inferences; but the rebuilding of your niece's estateâwhat means it? a coinage of the brain? Soartes. So credit it. Th'event may shake this faith. I am poor but thro' forbearance. When I seek, Urged by th'occasion, to amend my fortunes, Trust me! the strong expediency itself Shall furnish means. Ber. You bewilder me, my lord, more and moreâand the Ladye Meranie? At least, this is good newsâthisâof the count's return? Soartes. Say you? Good news indeed. Be satisfied. Your head and heart have matched them. Your heart, it has done well; your head, I fear, Is all out of its reckoning. Hark you, Bertrand, This must not pass your lips! Be cautious! The Ladye Meranie shall be apprised At the becoming juncture. Meanwhile, see to't, No whisper of the Count's proposals reach The air she breathes in. [Exit Bertrand. A devoted heart This simple fellow has! How I have puzzled him! And yet, alas! puzzled myself the more! Must I abandon all? throw off Gonseres And to th'impatient lover of the girl Denounce my villanyâconfess to have played The reckless gambler with her trusted gold, And to the fickle mercy of the dice Consigned her fairest acres? Must I stoop, Taking advantage of love's generous heyday, To move Vicente's pityâgaining only The more contempt? I am resolved, A well-timed word will school into compliance My gentle ward. She must renounce the Count And to a rougher lover link her fortunes. [Exit. Scene. 2. âA Wood. (Enter Inora and Gonseres.) Inora. Success is on thy brow. My bold and brave one! These tell-tale eyes flash triumphs, and the cheek That yesterday proclaimed thee by its chills To have renounced hope, is warm and radiantâ How fares thy noble master? Gon. Prosperously.â The drowning mariner clutches at a straw, (To use a current phrase) so, when I made In jesting tones allusion to our project, As if it were a fancy of my own, Boyish, unshaped and inconsiderate, At once, he caught at it, âSay you, Gonseres,â These were his words, âbut this is treason, lad,â Ungrateful treason and a breach of trust. To patch my fortunes by such desperate means I have no liking. True, the jewels avail not, And may as well enrich their native mines As lie barred up, unhonoured and disused, In cage of State.â No more, for a short space, He said, but into moody silence lapsed. At length, the harboured tenor of his thoughts Betrayed itself in curt soliloquies. âThree hundred thousand crowns!â; he spake their value, âThat rascal Zachary;â The usurer's bond Laden with interests hung upon the beamâ Debts, obligations, his fair ward's estate, All were compressed into the spiteful term,â All weighed against the back of lavish fortune. Inora. So guessed you, boy? The Baron was not wont To drivel thus. Gon. His dotage is upon him, Misfortune and old age are feeble-tongued And frail of purpose; were it otherwise, Sinewed with that strong sense of loyalty Which courtiers, more than life, esteem and cherish, The Lord Soartes, had a whisper fallen Counselling treason to his noble office, On the swift instant, would have stayed th'offence In the life's blood of him who uttered itâ Nay! but a year ago, (so suddenly Adversity hath changed him) to have perilled A jest within his hearing on this matter, Were dangerousânowâ Inora. At such a standstill hast thou left our emprise? Then needest thou the heels of Mercury Wherewith to baffle the blood-hounds of justice. Gon. Patience, good mother, I have boldly spoken Without reserve or niggard caution, He is our ownâto our high daring swornâ The right hand of our purpose. Nay, look not Incredulous. More strange things have occurred Than a perplexed, distressed, unhonoured nobleâ The jaundice in his eye, surrendering His disarmed heart to strong expediency. A tithe of this rich booty will suffice To reinstate Soartes, mend his fortunes, Recal his friends, prop up his drooping credit, To the best graces of the world restore him Hushing all rumours of his guardianship,â How, to the injury of his niece's interests, He hath discharged its duties; such amend, One stone, and that not costliest in renown, Of the rich hoard which to its kingly uses No eye of living man hath seen applied, Will render him. Inora. On these sore points to intrude And offend not, requires a skilful tongue, Licensed by usage, eloquent by nature, Winning as music, yet, discreet as silence. Gon. Oh! You mistake; no theme more welcome to him Than his home sorrowsânone so simply dealt with, A garrulous old man finds arguments In the mere look and bearing of his audience, And is entreated more by his own prate Than by the sage lips of a counsellor. To give Soartes rein upon this matter Is to economise my own blunt speech And shift the peril of incautious words To his more fitting shoulders. Inora. A rare youth! And of good promiseâyet, have care, Gonseres, Old foxes are more crafty than their cubs. Gon. I have not been the Baron's confidant (Servitor call it, or some baser term,) All to no purpose. From my boyhood upward, Each feature of the man I've made my study; In every varying and conjunctionâ His mirth and melancholyâsmile and frownâ His virtues and his failingsâhow to move His gusty nature and again allay it, Lulling the storm with timeous flatteryâ How to adjust him to a hundred fancies And his whole heart attune and modulate. Inora. This cannot be the noble Baron Soartes? Thou facest me with falsehood, daring boy! To such a depth of degradation He is not fallen that was my bosom's lord? Unsay thy words that I may yet regard him In my mind's eye a valorous nobleman, Without a rival in accomplishmentsâ One fit to league with us in this design And do it honourânot the wretch thou picturest, So facile and made ready to our purpose. Inora. Nayâmove me not to pity But say what chances aid our enterpriseâ How thrives thy love suit with the Baron's niece? Gon. As love-suits thrive where one heart beats for both, The Lady Meranie is all attuned To the soft zephyrs of persuasion, And her formed ear recoils from my rude wooing. Inora. Of this I warned thee; fix no blame on me, But should thy gusty passion be allayed By such reception, 'tis auspicious. Than a career of love thou hast before thee A loftier course; leave simple souls to love! Its stratagems are all of vulgar sort Which the most lowly of capacities May compass. Of what purpose is't to urge Thy scorned suit upon a scornful heart, When in the time thus fritter'd, thou could'st build Thy claim upon her hand? The ward's consent Is bound up in the guardian's iron willâ That gained, thou hast a more availing key To this fair fortress and its stubborn gates, Than the slow siege of love, Gon. Now, I give credit To the strange tale of yesterday. That thus You do foresay my fix'd expedient Argues our kindred more than solemn oaths, Good mother! Inora. If thou hast, Gonseres, On thy aspiring passion laid this curb, So to acquit thyself betokens thee A man of purpose. By such strong resolves, Triumphs are made secure and unknown names Enslave the winds to carry them abroad. Now, at this moment, thou'rt a surer gainerâ The prize more safe than were thy love requited. Proceedâsay, by what subtle leading strings Toward our project thou hast drawn Soartesâ The measure, tell, of his entanglement And what retreat is left him. Gon. To have moved The proud old noble by a mere suggestion, Drop't artfully in seeming artlessness, Of this, I reckon lightly. Poverty,â The estrangement of his friendsâthe pressing claims Of creditors, but chiefly, (for brave men Dare browbeat fortune when their hands are stainless) Threat'ning dishonour have so wrought on him That in this desperate state, no remedy Too desperate is, not to engage his fancy. In such apt humour is the tended soil, A child may sow the seeds of disaffection. Inora. At such a standstill hast thou left our emprise? Then needest thou the heels of Mercury Wherewith to baffle the blood-hounds of justice. Gon. Patience, good mother, I have boldly spoken Without reserve or niggard caution, He is our ownâto our high daring swornâ The right hand of our purpose. Nay, look not Incredulous. More strange things have occurred Gon. I feared it all. Some inexpedient craze O'ertakes you, mother. To ennoble thus Into a valiant and renowning feat, Needful of men of spirit and great aims This burglar's enterprise, is out of question. As mover in it, take thy fill of credit, But now, that I am part in the design, I will be leader or throw up all part in't. Nay! look not so incredulous of my speech Or my unfilial temper think to sway By motherly advice, or threat or scorn. If, toward Soartes you have such contempt Because adversity hath sharpened him Into a tool for traitrous purposes, The less occasion you shall have to hold Gonseres at the same drawback of credit. Inora. That thou betray'st thyself a child of shame More than thy mother's son, thy father's bastard, I make no boast of. Go and prosper, boy; All claims to thy success I now renounce, If shame be thy reward, take what is due thee, If riches and the safety of thy neck, Thou wilt need both and yet have shift to live. [Exit. Gon. Oh mother! whom as witch I did regard, Pregnant with direful maledictions, Until the day thou did'st disclose thyself; This is the jargon of thy cast-off trade, No foreign devil doth inspire thee to't. Much less a truthful angel! 'Tis at random Thou venturest thy shafts upon the wind: For one that strikes, a thousand fall abroad. Good bye! Take thanks for the suggestion That builds my fortunes! I have faith in thee, Because the ark of my unformed life Was thy warm womb. Thou would'st not slay with blab What on the inauspicious day of birth Escaped thy hands unstrangled? Good bye, mother! [Exit. Scene. 3. (Enter Soartes and Gonseres.) Gon. I have seen Zachary the usurer, As you desired, my lord. Soartes. Good! he agrees To abate his claim and stretch the term of payment? Gon. 'Tis an unwholesome den and starving air That coops him up. I marked no living thing But a swoll'n spider on the murky walls. Soartes. You moved himâpleaded for me? Gon. Oh! I used Blunt eloquenceâthe sword's hilt to the elbowâ It prevailed nothing. His lack lustre eye Moved from the parchment to my sheathed weapon And then resum'd its charge. No tremor shook Or checked th'impetuous quill. Its talk complete, He folded up the missiveânothing said But slid it towards me, then graciously Waved a good-morrow. See, this will explainâ (Soartes reads)â âI have indulged your lordship too often. The pretext is still the same. There is no course left me but the one in progress. Of the resources your lordship hints at I am entirely ignorant. The interest on the bonds continues unpaid. The bonds themselves are unredeemed. No movement has been made to relieve or extinguish them. It pains me once more to refuse your lordship's request. The execution must proceed, Further delay is impossible.â âZachary.â Soartes. The flint hearted villain! Gon. Being at this pass. Matters are fain to mend. Courage, my lord. Soartes. These threats of angry fortune help to arm me And her rough usage drills for worse encounter. Your desperate scheme, so desperate yesterday, Is now at this dark crisis of events An inspired Godsend. I embrace itâcling to it; It is no longer desperateâno longer The criminal, dishonouring, traitorous project Which, at the unfolding, to your features gave Uncarnate lustre, startling and repelling. Now do I know that crushing poverty Makes apt for crime, and crimes, at whose recital Prosp'rous men shudder, to the consciences Of their necessitous and goaded actors Bring no reproach. Good angels more upbraid The boastful virtues of the Pharisee Than the compliances which men unread In the abrupt law of Adversity, Punish with scourge and chain. I shrink no longer. Gonseres! you have gained me to your purpose. Gon. Betwixt us, let no misconception halt. Foremost, you engage, Being by virtue of a regal charter, Hereditary warder of the palace, Within whose walls, since the demise ofâ The jewels have lain, caged up in idle state; To the sealed chamber where this treasure lies You pledge me safe direction. Soartes. Be assured Of full instructionsâall facility, No one to challenge youâno mask required. The sentinels that pace the palace walls Are in the dark: even the king himself Suspects no buried entrance to his homeâ No bolt unguardedâguarding royalty. Gon. This is all well. A dragon to confront Tempts not my fancy. I am used to hold Danger, itself the intruder, in disdain, Not to adventure in bold quest of it, Or woo its presence. When it comesâa fig for't! Soartes. Let not such confidence o'ermatch discretionâ Seem but yourself; while you are doubly prudent, And note you, good Gonseres! I am here In the back ground, myselfâthe Baron Soartesâ Trust-worthy keeper of the royal palace, No plotter or accompliceâignorant As the unconscious infant of your purpose! Gon. Not safer is your secret in the grave Than in my living bosom. I, alone, Stir in the matter, scheme and execute, Betrayed by circumstance, I only suffer. Soartes. Enough! Gonseresâwe agree in this, Gon. I consent to it; leave all to my care, Thus far, up to this crisis, our design Promises wellâfurther, the jewels secured, We are, in bettering us, no way advanced But stand in peril imminent as ever. The rarest diamondsâpure as angels' tears, Which their possessor trembles to disclose Or traffick with, are of less vantage to him Than pebbles by disdainful billows tossed, And re-tossed on the surly ocean's marge; Nay! when thus bid and hampered in their lustre, They become baleful and, like stars eclipsed, Bode evil. Soartes. True, Gonseres, and in thisâ The vigilant disposal of our booty; Lies your chief service! Let discretion guide you. The prize secured, push boldly to the frontiersâ Make no delay nor doubtful seem nor anxious, But use the common diligence of traders; And see to it, Gonseres, that the gems Singled and unincumbered of their setting, Are so concealed about youâso disposed Upon your person, as to give no pretext Of busy search to keen officials. I sayâpush boldly on, hie thee to ? And there arrived, enquire for one Balsido A jeweller and vendor of rare things Whom having found, treat with considerately, Disclosing to his view no other portion Of our rich booty than may satisfy For my relief and your necessities. And this observe, Gonseres, I require The gold without delay. Old Zachary Is clamorous for his crowns and must be heeded. Three hundred thousand will redeem the bondâ Clear off all burdens on my ward's estate And for the brief remainder of life's voyage Refit my labouring and exhausted bark. Gon. Three hundred thousand crowns! a lavish sum To raise at notice. Think you this Balsido Will prove compliant?âhas the means at hand? Soartes. I know him by report. He is no stinted, haggling usurer, Like Zachary. Kings treat with him and flourish! The mystic touchstone of philosophers Is in his keeping. The red gold is dealt him In generous ingots by his god-dame Fortuneâ Not doled out peevishly in single coins, But from her dazzling and unfailing hoard Emptied in lapfuls. Gon. You describe, my lord, One much too honest or too much a knave. Soartes. Of such rare knaves, the pride is honesty: Count on Balsido, he will faithful prove; As for outwitting you, that is your care. At lowest estimate, the jewels are worth A million crownsâone diamond put asideâ A priceless gem famed in old history. The great Alfonso, so the legend runs, At his sword's point transferred from Moorish casque To his own princely brow the glittering trophy. This gem, regard me, let the sun shine on't Will start to life, aye, like a trumpet speak, And stir the very midriff of the realm. It's king adorning lustre, in the course Of centuries has travell'd the wide earth, Troubling high thrones and filling camps with envy. Indolent monarchs, for this jewel's sake, And to increase the honour of their crowns, Have menaced war, purposed alliances, Achievments wrought by lovers unexcelled. From its renown, base men have culled renown, And those of gentle birth, denied its presence, Have halted betwixt death and infamy. Such virtues as to this rare gem belong, Mark me, Gonseres, must have no display. To traitors, loyalty is treacherous; The amulet of royalty doubly so, Bury it, therefore, deep in the dark soil, As thou would'st hide a woful pestilence, With humid clods sealing the sun's bright eye And disencouraging the prying stars. Gon. Your prudent wishes to the very letter I shall comply with, credit me, my lord, The impatience of my nature, kingly gewgaws Avail to move, less, oh, immeasurably! Than the surpassing jewelâthe bright star To possess which I am thus stirred to serve you. Soartes. This lovers extasy, I fear, Gonseres, Is inauspicious and befriends us not. For heaven's sake stay it, so our lofty fortunes May run together, side by side, and prosper. Why charge, I ask, so perilous an adventure With such a freight and thus below itself Debase the noble emprise you are sworn to? Be more the man and shake this boy-love off. It is a taming, heart-dividing folly Which unmakes those who cherish it. Gon. Fear not; This very extasy you lavish doubts on Is your salvationâthe main-spring that prompts meâ The pledge of our success. Having it not, I hold no tie but simple gratitude, Towards your cause, and gratitude is never The faithful and absorbing power that love is, So strong yet so compliantâso enslaving And yet so servileâso ingenious And manifold in its devices, yet, Toward the single purpose of the heart So steadfast. Gratitude is a forced virtue, And its exotic life, a crossing breath May chill and wither. Even the hand that rears it, By one ungentle pressure, often stays it. But love, how different! exalts and thrives On its necessities, endures to increase, And is more weakened by indulgent care Than unkind usage. Oh! you wrongly judge, When you would leave to feeble gratitude A charge to save you and love's higher claim So disregard. Soartes. Gonseres, be more generous. It was but yesterday that you extolled The virtue you now slander. There was nothing You durst not brave under its influenceâ Stalk lionsâleap into the heart of battleâ Wrestle with serpentsâharness crocodiles And ferry ocean on their scaly backs; These to the grateful heart were feats of pleasure. Such gratitude expressed in such big words I trusted. Have I erred? Am I deceived? And is this virtue a mere text to rant on? What then your love but a more recent boast-word? Gon. I spake of honestyâof honest service. Command me still and I engage myself T'atchieve all this and yet remain your debtor. In such adventure life is hazarded, Not in contempt of honour, but to win it, 'Tis otherwise when men are tasked to crime, To midnight murders, robberies and treasons; More than sweet life is honour then imperilled,â A thing so sacred in some men's esteem It is the life of life and slain its slayer, Soar. Honour and thou, Gonseres! Thou and Honour! Gon. Does it amaze you more than my presumption? Have I aspired to your fair niece's hand And hold the assent of her dear guardianâ Her worthy, doting, conscientious uncle, Yet am denied the common grace of life, And in my teeth submit to have dishonour Flung thusâits days vile garbage to a cur? Soartes. Gonseres! Gon. The name savours of reproach! My ears construe it so, and yet, my lord, It is a faultless name, not like Iscariot; I might discard it for its euphony And pride myself in some jaw-breaking terms That would rout scandal and arrest the tongue Of froward men, familiar in their phrase; But no! thy favorite hound was my god-father And to this dog-call I am broken-in, Yet not so used, but that my ears do tingle When base lips utter it. Soar. I cry you mercy! The young blood in you is too hot for me. Be careful of your scorn while it is harmless. Lest it draw ruffling smiles and words that fester. Boy! oh, boy! Am I persuaded to entrust myself All to your keepingâan old world-worn manâ To so unformed and rash a counsellor? That I am thus possessed, what is my crime? And what the spell you have to mould me thus? Reply, just heavens! and free me from this bondage! Poverty cannot crush as you would crush me; The usurer's grip is not so torturingâ His worst, not the extreme of all extremes. If human and no demon, as I fear, Be moved to a surrender of your purposeâ You who, not holding can discourse of honour And rate the price so highly. Oh! be moved! In my behalf, not to abate its value, But what remains to me, allow to live. Gon. My lord, upon a treasure long renounced You lavish words. When your fair ward's estate Lies at the hammer's mercy, will men say Her guardian was a just, fair dealing man, The paragon of honour? Will the Jew, Old Zachary, remain your right-hand surety, And to keep up your good repute, defer His pond'rous claims? He is not Mammon's priest Who at the altar stone, with bloodless knife Unbinds his victim. Talk no more of thisâ Irresolute old man! Honour and thou! So far I cast the words back in your teeth Honour and thou are at their quarrel's door!â Soar. Alas! the remedyâ Gon. A Godsend, call it, That shall repair your fortunes and prop up The crazed idol at its hour of doom. Soar. But Meranie? Gon. Whom you have doated on, Whom you have tended, like another father, And made forget the true home of her youth Garnished with love in your still kinder home; When the storm breaks which gathers over you, Look in the piteous face of that fair girl And ask in whose behoof and by what limner Those features have been wrought? Soar. Then you, Gonseres, You too, can pity her? Say, you do pity And will accord one kindness for her sake; I will be slave you to in all the rest, You shall the choicest of our spoils have choice ofâ A double portion, yield but this one favour. Gon. Express it, name it, I have patience left me To endure the surmise of my heart, no longer. Soar. Hear me, I pray, in simple charity, When in a pressing moment I agreed To indulge your claim, no other end had I Than to divert the fancies of a boy. Esteeming them of wild, uncertain natureâ Sudden of dissolution as of growth, Which if untended by the hand that sprung them Could not survive even the noon heats of summer. Gon. A natural deceit. You flatter me. I am less harmed than obligedâwhat then? My fancies are unchangedâmy claim unshakenâ The centre-spring of all my servicesâ Th'impelling power that would revive your fortunes My life is in this loveâall fixed here! Soar. Such truth deserves return, is it so met? Or have you cast it on the aimless winds And wait their message of repaying love? Oh! dupe, that tak'st to heart the scorn of woman Yet think'st to overcome it by endurance! Gon. Three weeks ago, you soldered up this chain And led me by it. Am I tamer grown Or have you ready-forged a heavier shackle? Ev'n yesterday, you quoted from love's jest book Some idle rhythm and winked with vexing pleasure, When for the rightful heroine, you supplied The name of Meranieâmaking sly halt thereon. Soar. You force me to be plain. The Count Vicente Has now returned and claims my niece's hand. I am appris'd by himâbut see, here is The document itself. It needs no comment, And will explain my conduct. Gon. Count Vicente! I bear this man no love. Two years ago, The dates agreeâhe rescued from the lash A ragged urchin who had crossed my path In the deer forest on the quarry's track; Rescued, I said,âfair words did all the office Backed by the presence of his retinue. They were enough and nettled more than threats, This feigned courtesy I fix'd no quarrel on, But now, that with less reason in his meddling, He quaffs my fountain, plucks my odorous flower Darkens and disenchants my purest star, Betwixt us, Heaven! there beats a life too many! Soar. Had one requiting turn befallen your love, A smile, a word, a ringlet, the hand's pressure, And Meranie betrayed you by such token There were excuse for this outburst of hate. Assert not her affection for Vicente Thus unincumbered, is Vicente's crime, And at his guileless door lay all your wrongs, Heap them at once upon this hoary head And nerve your fullest vengeanca to the stroke, So that no dregs remain to satisfy: Let not a shadow of past friendshipânothing Presume to intrude betwixt you and your victim. Hear me, Gonseres! must I say coward to stir you? Gon. A choicer word hath deluged hearths with blood, But they were men that used it and not dotards. To take for such reproach a life reproached, Th'exacting code of honour does not teach me. Soar. More cruel are your tongue-thrusts than your sword, The word I spake to move you, now, take home! (draws) Gon. Of the same tide, this is the second billow! In vain I am assailed. Put up your weapon. An earthquake hath disordered both our senses. I have no quarrel but with my destiny. In the crusade of love, to be so routed Lies beyond all conception of disaster: Let us shake hands, my lord, I am restored; The qualm is off and with it all ill-will, I bear no malice to Vicente longer. But when your niece and he have joined their fortunes, Our business prosp'ring, shall endow her amply Out of my own division of the booty. Soar. Your generous heart is once more in its place. Now, I can proudly glance to my right hand And re-assured turn face upon the future. (Enter Bertrand.) Ber. My lord, the whole synagogue is upon us. Here is the Jew Zachary, two clerks, a notary, three timber merchants, a picture dealer, and half a score besides of the city gentry, just let loose from the diligence. Such a swarm of hornets hasn't buzzed about our ears for many a day. I have a shrewd guess they are here for some mischief, and to judge by the wistful eye which one fellow, a scampish looking quill-driver armed with a birding piece, bears towards the park, your lordship's venison is in some danger. Soar. The earth is not yet cold pressed by your footsteps Betwixt us and that usurer's pestilent den Before th'impatient bloodhounds are let forth. What shall I do to keep the roof above me And stretch for my proud oaks their day of grace? I pray you aid my wits to some expedient Gon. How is it with the larder? Soar. Help me Bertrand. Ber. I have known matters a trifle better, my lord. It is now fifty years agoâ Soar. Plague take your slow digestion! Ber. Since my late lord your noble father, peace to his soul! gave an entertainment to his most Christian majestyâ Soar. Tush! Bertrand, The bones of buried feasts are marrowless And sad fare is the memory of abundance; Speak to the point. How is your larder stocked? Ber. As to the quality, my lord, I declare nothing. It is wholesome meat which agrees with those who engulph it; and if the carcase of an old buck found dead by the ranger this day se'night can be rendered savoury, trust me, there will be no reason to say, were there a score of guests to look to, that we starve either Jew or Christian. Besides, the fish pond has a stray jack or two in it, and there's the old gander in the barn-yard. Gon. Good, at this pinch, it serves you to shew plenty Garnished with garden stuffs and summer fruitsâ The gatherings of the woods; a treat so rare, Given spontaneously will win you favour. Soar. But Zachary? I have no hope to appease him? Gon. Oh, fear not. Melt the others to your wishes And he will parley out of helplessness. You must have generous wine to work their brains with, A prime old vintage, gracious to the taste But cunning in its fume. Soar. What say you, Bertrand? Is the dry rot aspread among your casks And all the virtue of our cellars gone? Ber. Why, my lord, that there is no lack of empty binns and staved barrels, is beyond arguing. I have known the dayâ Soar. Well-well, conclude this threatened roundabout. Say, you have wine? Ber. There is the cask my lord in which your honour, as master Gonseres who had a hand in the freak will remember, 'tis now seven years past and upwards, drowned a litter of puppies. You gave orders that it should be closed up and kept unbroached. Soar. It was a happy thought. I had lost mind o't. By this time, the grape Will have attained maturity. I envy The dogs their spicy swill. May the whole litter Choke in its dregs. Bertrand, you know my wishes. For lack of cooks spare not the venison. These cits are kitchen-bred and con amore Will play their part. Remember tankard lawâ Beguile them with a toast or flageolet airâ A snatch of silly song and see they quaff to't, Let none escape until his wits lie drenched; Meanwhile Gonseres, I will go and pay A host's respects to master Zachary. [Exeunt Soartes and Bertrand. Gonseres (solus.) A boyish love! not one requiting turn in't! Oh these baffled eyes! Where were they when this doating rival crossed them? To yield to love's neglect and he th'occasion Is to receive my sentence from his mouth. I can endure it. We shall not fall out Until this weakness pass, and Meranieâ (The name hath an expiring fragrance in't That wins me to inhale it to the latest), Being Vicente's so enriches him, That my revenge, now inexpedient Shall have full swing and opportunity. [Exit. End of Act I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. Scene. 1. âA Wood. (Enter Lady Meranie and Ella.) Mer. A mother's love, dear Ellaâ This natural blending of sweet sounds together, Steals on my ear, like solemn music which The whispers of the intermediate wind Have taken their part inâa strain, once familiar, Wandering by snatches and disordered chimes Back on the memory. A mother's love! How far into our childhood they retake us, These magic words! even to the earliest dawn Of living consciousness. I feel them move me And at their impulse, shape a radiant dream Instinct with all maternal fondnesses. I hear sweet tones and silver melodies; Warm lips press mine and hold me with their fragrance; Soft arms caressingly are folded round me. What means all this unusual extasy? Ah! why does fancy, dearest Ella, thus Mock me, at such a time, with such a vision? Ella. Make happy barter of unhappy thoughtsâ This is your birthday, come, sweet sister, wear it Upon your face and be in birthday humour; I bring good news. Mer. My heart is full already, Alas! I fear some evil is at hand So to impel this blessed visitor And disengage her from the love of angels Towards the offspring of her earlier love. Ella. Heav'n, dearest Meranie, requires of us To its own sacred soil to lift our faith, And bows not down with its redeemed souls To disengage us by their high persuasion From earth's affections. Mer. I but spake, my Ella, Regarding a kind vision and sweet blessings; And with my changeful destiny to link them Is natural in this ebb-time of joy. Ella. But, I have news for you, dear Meranie, Will stay and turn the rough, retiring tide, Bidding its waves set in triumphantly. My brotherâ Mer. Keep me not in high suspense The Count Vicenteâname him. Is he well? Has he returned? Have you seenâ Ella. Take breath! This torrent of headlong queries will exhaust you And overpowers reply. Give time to rally, Sweet sister. Mer. Oh! be lenient to my hopes, As you have been to my forebodings cruel. Ella. You shall have all in one brief sentence told you, My brother has left ?, and is now. By royal command on matters of high moment, Detained upon the frontiers. At the utmost, A fortnight, so he writes me, may elapse Before he is relieved. Mer. A fortnight, Ella? Ella. How aghast you look! How taken aback by this ill-timed disclosure! Dear Meranie! I meant t'have overjoyed you. And yet you tremble? Ay! a fortnight! Is it (Now that two years ungrudged and unbemoaned Have passed) too tedious or too brief a term? A fortnight. Oh! true love endures to death And by the life-time of its cherisher, Not by starved weeks, is measured. Nay! it stretches Into the future and becomes eternal. Mer. Up to this hour, I have been patient, Ella, And in my patience hidden all my woe, Even from you, I have refrained myself Who bear'st my bosom's secrets in your own. You know not all. Only my joy you know,â The secrets of my joy, not of my torture. Ella. You would relate to me an open rumour Touching your uncle's prodigalityâ His distraught fortunes and abuse of trust. How to repair his credit, he hath beggared His simple ward. It is the world's small whisper? But will the Count Vicenteâwill my brother,â My brave and honoured brother so regard it As to abate one jot of constancy Or love the less, because your heart is needier? Oh! you mistake and wrong his noble nature! Mer. Forgive me, Ella, never can I wrong him, In thought or wordânever do this injustice! To question his being constant were to cast Doubt on myselfâto acknowledge myself changed. That rumour and her gossips had been idle. In this disastrous hour, would have amazed me, I wonder more, seeing they thus traduce My guardian's fame, they have advanc'd no further; And yet the secret of my wretchedness Is not the cruel reverse which hath befallen Our noble line, nor my betrayed estate. If it has saved my uncle, he is welcome To every acre. I shall not upbraid him Nor charge this wrong upon his silver'd head: But, Ella, he hath dared, being my guardian, And under cover of his office, further T'abuse all trust. With open injury He mingles insultâtramples on my heartâ Dictates my hand's disposalâmocks and threatens. All this he does, and yet I must endure it. The former fondness of the uncle melts me, I cannot find rebellion in my blood Enough to oppose him. Ella. You arouse my wonder. I am bewildered, Meranie: recount These so fastidious woesâthese imminent wrongsâ That, powerless to assuage, I may partake them. Mer. Alas! your friendshipâthe most earnest love Cannot divide this burden with my heart, You have observed that, of late years, the Baron Hath lowered himself to terms of intimacy With one Gonseres, keeper of his kennelâ A foundling and withal a saucy boy. 'Tis said that at a boar-hunt, this bold stripling At his own peril, shielded my uncle's life And thus secured his binding gratitude, Let this be, as it may, the daring youth Is high in his esteemâa right-hand counsellorâ Familiar with the secrets of his bosom. Nay, more; Soartes hath embolden'd him T'assail my ear with his admiring speech And lay the project of his insolent love Open before me. This the forward boy Within the passing fortnight, twice hath dared, And twiceâthe first time with cold courtesy, The next, with indignation and disdain, I did repel him,âElla! dearest Ella! Had you but seen him on that last repulse, With all the demon of his heart stirred up And gathering on his faceâthe panther eyes Illumining the swart, forbidding browâ The tortured lip settling into resolveâ The impatient working of his clenched fistâ The sudden wheeling and impetuous stride, At discord, yet in very keeping with The laugh that shook the woodsâOh! you would give Fluttering terror entrance to your bosom And let the foresight of sad evil sway you. Ella. There is some mystery here, dear Meranie; That this Gonseres so acquits himself I will believe; but that your guardianâ A reckless man, 'tis true, and prodigalâ Is so debased and lost to common shame As to take part in such a daring suitâ To move in it, to dictate and to threatenâ Exceeds all credence. Mer. Alas! 'tis truth. The soul's nobility Which once in prosp'rous days became his bearing And as a genuine and appointed star Was recognized, hath vanished with his fortunes. Then, a rude fiction would have mov'd to tears And the wind's plaint have counsell'd charity. Now, tears in burning showers themselves prevail not And storms of urgent woe howl on unheeded, His eye, his ear, his bosom, all are seal'd. Ella. The roof that shelters this dishonoured head Is no safe shield for yours. Mer. His claim, I fear, As guardian compels me to its shelter. Ella. A precious guardianâa trust-worthy uncle! No, Meranie, the wrongs already done you Extinguish every claim and rend all ties. Come, let me lead you to a happier hearth place. I take no curt denial from your lipsâ No plea for longer thought on't or delay. You have a sister's arms to welcome you, And betwixt these, a sister's beating heart. Mer. I yield, dear Ella! doubly I am conquer'd By pressing fears and by your pressing love. Chide not my weakness in your secret soul; I know not what to say in this extreme, Or how you think of me or where beside, Save on your proferred breast, to fold my wing. Ella. Playmates together, we have been as sisters, And now, grown up, we shall in truth be such, My brother's love for you, the endearing name Already sanctions, and erelong, heav'n favouring, Will give assurance of. (Enter Gonseres.) Gon. Fair mistresses! In this retreat to muffle up your charms: It is a wasteful pity. Were I poet, I would arraign you of high felony That thus of an enchanting theme you rob me, And doing so, defraud the world of song. Ella. Pray, sir, pass on your way. Gon. My errand leads no further. I halt here, With your permission, ladies; and am earnest To win your favour by my services: Shall I chase butterflies or scramble banks For dewy flowers and startle timid hares? Or shall I gather berries or shower down The yellowing nuts or with my ready knife Shape lively whistles and the birds make envious That until lilt-time cower in these thick boughs? This I can do, if it but meet your pleasure. I have a natural art in woodland musicâ Know all its tricksâthe outs and ins of songâ Can mock the melting love-lay of the cushatâ The warble of the thrushâthe prate of jays And garrulous daws. Ella. Such lore is not our fancyâ The dove bemocked might fetch the hawk upon us And you are free to scold the jays elsewhere: Flowers, nuts, and berries we can pull ourselves; The lev'rets you would scare, gambol before us The privileged companions of our walks. We have no craving for your services, Pray pass, sir. Gon. You have twice expressed yourself And but one voice hold claim to, Mistress fair! What says this trembler? I have good credentials And am committed to a grateful charge. Your uncle, Ladye Meranie, has sent me, There being certain madcap citizens Now at the castle, who, were you to meet them In your retired strolls, might prove uncourteous And push beyond a jest their foppish freedoms; I am deputed therefore by my lord To offer you protection and safe conduct. Besides, I hold it duty to inform you Of a high entertainment given by The noble Baron in honour of his guests. At which to enhance and grace it, he requires Your early presence. Ella. This is to the pointâ You now have spoken your errand like a man, And your bird-whistles placed the heel upon. Hie to the noble Baron, your noble master, With my respectsâI bear him much respect! And say, it is the pleasure of his niece The Ladye Meranie, to accept the welcome Of a lov'd friend and to that friend's retreat Bring new delights and make the summer sunnier, I trust you to be safeguard to my message, Not to my friend. Gon. You credit me with more Than my dull brains are meant to execute. 'Tis a fair spoken message to the Baron That, by her mouthpiece, Ladye Meranie Hath chosen to entrust. Suppose I word it so And take rebellions tidings to his ear, How he will stare and misbelieve himself Or else affirm his ward hath lost her reason! Ella. Should this be all, it will enliven you. A jest below his roof is now-a-days Of rare occurrence. Gon. You are pleasant, madam, I will be brief; the Ladye Meranie Shall bear me company. Ella. The lamb and butcher! A proper fellowâyou, Master Gonseres, To come to this decision. Well! what next? Your presence has tongue-tied my gentle friend; Yet on her face, it needs no conjuror's skill To read refusal. Come, move off, I pray, You are a thought too friendlyâ Gon. Sooth!âgood madam! You take with kindly spirit to a quarrel. Permit in your friend's ear a single whisper, And I will answer for it, she will bend Her head in graceful token of compliance And follow, without murmur. Mer. Miscreant! If you the spell-word hold which can so move me Aloud pronounce it, so that this fair earth May disavow the guilty forgery And cast it in your teethâa demon's coinage, Stamped with foul falsehood and the coward's menace. Gon. Be patient, heart, this is a woman's anger Made up of stormy and unmeasured sounds, Cloudy distrust and pointless inuendoes, Its natural wild-fire! You esteem me highly Sweet Ladye, by submitting my devotion To such fierce ordeal, yet requite it thus. Is it because I am presumptuous And soar, not crawl, in love, that I am scorned? A foundling and base-born who have made choice Betwixt the postures of a slave and freeman, Daring with head and hand to help my heart And take the uses of all three to serve me? If so, to push still higher will become My nature, but in this, your scorn prevents meâ That scorn, believe it, more confirms my passion, Than helps to conquer it. Remove this barrier, And I shall soar againâseek one more worthy To lavish my free heart on and forget That I had lov'd and left my early choice. Ella. This is mad talkârepulsive more than mad, A dark-souled libertine'sâits very pith Rank disaffection and its marrow treason Against th'upright nobility of nature: Such love to virtue proferr'd is offensive, More than disfavour and avowed hate, Had you a spark of good wrought in you, sir, Or that respect and reverence of good, Which, after all, is but one's self-respect, You would not thus have dar'd to insult my friend. Your love, forsooth! And is't to urge this bold, unworthy passion Under a cloud of pretexts, you are here? Gon. Spare me, I am unused to whet my tongue And war with women. 'Tis dull cant, all this, I have no leisure for it, with your leave; Therefore, be quick, fair mistresses! and take, As the wind-up, your parting courtesies, I and my gentle charge must on our way. Ella. Move, sirrah, but a step and I shall make The woods ring out and every tree start help; A breath upon this horn will fetch me those Would use no ceremony to your vantage. [Blows a horn. Gon. Bravo! sweet pet! This music does thy bidding And all its chivalry of echoes throng Into the field of rescue at the summons. Yon leafy rampart is astir with champions And I to brave them, do esteem myself A valorous man and wear my boldest brow. Ha! as I live, that was no baby's breath But the rough gust of some strong trumpeter. [Horn sounds at a distance. Ella. Thou wilt have need of all thy brazen fore-head For this encounter. Better be advised, Fellow! and pass. Gon. I have my tongue and sword, Both are well proved and in the mood of strife. In sooth, you take me for a craven at heart Whom the recoil of silver sounds emboldens But blustering notes do scare and terrify. Nay, Ladye fair, I will abide th'event, Were this forewarner of a lion's mien And limb'd like Hercules, (Enter Count Vicente.) Ella. Vicente!âbrother! Blessings be on the star that guides thee hither! Vic. A star more blest is not in all night's concave My Ella! my sweet Ladye Meranie! Accept in one short breath, a world of greetings! [To Gonseres. Sir, page! you are relieved from your officeâ Its duties fall on me, as sweet delights, Commend me highly to the Lord Soartes; Such commendation will absolve you, boy, And justify the act of your return. Gon. Page! boy! what next? I have a servile earâ A servile mouth charged with soft messages: In hand and foot, most servilely equipped Is poor Gonseres. What a servile soul! His services dispensed withâyet in service! Relieved, but still in bonds! Proud Count Vicente! Thou would'st deter me by this haughty speech From my ambition. Ella. 'Tis a moonstruck youth, At crisis of his fever, whom Soartes Hath sent as escortâa presuming stripling The inconsiderate old man hath reared And pampered soâthe minion is the master. Go boy! and keep this bravery for thine equals, Your presence is ill-timedâ Gon. More so this taunt! Boy, boy, again, and minion! Count Vicente! On thee as vow'd defender of this lady, My fair traducer, I fix cause of quarrel. [Draws. Vic. Put up thy willow or go temper it, If thou wilt brawl; elsewhere. The King has foes, So has the State, go, test its edge on them, Ere thou presumest to take rash affront And so imperil by headstrong arrogance The life thou owest thy country. Gon. Draw, defend! (They fightâGonseres is disarmed. Vicente breaks his sword. Vic. There, patch thy weapon and thy beard let grow! In a hereafter period, thou may'st prove Thyself a better swordsman. To have spilt Such maiden blood was to have wrong'd the sward And robb'd kind nature of her emerald wealth. To do thee justice, thou but wantest age And some experience to acquit thee well, The drawback is thy weak presumption. [ExeuntâVicente and ladies. Gon. I will think on't, proud Signor, I will think on't Ay! and act on it. For thy scorn, a fig! It shall be doubled back upon its givers When my good stars are climbing to their zenith, All, in fit season! Triumph until then! And that thou hast of her, hug and caressâ I will notch down the hours as they go byâ Nay, every golden moment take account of, So that upon the day of reckoning, I nothing may omit of what I owe thee. (Enter Inora.) Now, my proud mother! come and feast these eyes, And put your wondrous day-dreams to the test, Oh! the ambition of that doting heart,â The dotage and fallacious frailty Of such ambition! Honour I have done with, Henceforward, be it to my bastard ears A word most hateful and audacious! Ino. Say love, instead, Gonseres! Let this hate Rest on the head of its appropriate sin. Honour is graceful, enviable, holy; 'Tis some men's heritage, but all may win it, The basest-born can to this virtue lean, And to his bosom clasp its good repute. To cherish honour is to cherish that Which life endears. Conscience itself is kept In chastity by its sweet influence; But thy offenceâthe hurt thou doest thyself To no redeeming virtue is allied. Gon. Of that you speak which a girl's scorn has slain, Else, had it liv'd, even starving upon hope, I had not flung my honour to the winds; But now the love you jeer at and denounce Is hate become; let honour go and beg! So thankless and luxurious a charge I will no longer pamper. Inora. Yet be taught What shame is, stubborn boy? These twenty years Have I endured it, as the felon does His dungeon fetters. A long night 't hath been And weary, but one star hung on the vault, And its kind ray, too oft by clouds obscured, Escaped, to yield sweet solace, now and then. That star, Gonseres, was thy starâto me The star of hope, atoning and sustaining, My heart hath hung to it, by night and dayâ In dream-time and the hours when dreams are over. Thy mother's history and thine own are one. The Baron Soartes whom thou reckonest To be at once thy master and thy dupe, Is, all in ignorance of the tender tie, Thy fatherâI his dupe, his mistress once Befooled by loveâa very fool in love! Even yet, cast off, forgotten in his heartâ Supplanted since by bauble upon bauble, The faith that bound me to him is not dead, With this devoted remainder of love His and thy fortunes have been watched and mused on; All the reverses of his waning years And of thy waxing manhood all the winnings. For him, for thee I have deferred life And stayed the impulse in me to be quit o't. Gon. So to have done deserves our gratitude. Thy best restraint, thy staff, thy daily cheer, Thine eye-feast and thy heart's feast, mother kind! Have been the down-fall of thy bosom's lordâ Here is the secret thou hast chosen to live forâ Revenge and Triumph! Inora. Demon! Gon. Thou hast said itâ Our blood is of one sort. I am a demon! A demon's mother, thou! Inora. I suckled not Thy vampire lipsâ Gon. 'Tis true. The bloodhound did This office. Be my surly nurse thy accuser! Thou think'st to cheat me with endearing tongue Now, when the fate thou did'st consign me to The very dogs refused to administer? I have survived th'unmotherly intent Think you, to be persuaded by soft terms? Go to! The breath is baleful they are fraught with? [Exit. Inora. Oh destiny!âI am deceived in thee! My star this day hath lost its worshipper; Why rose the kindling and inebriate thought Of reparation and a glorious future? Why interposed this lunacy of fame, Betwixt the sacrifice my shame required, And its too credulous offerer? Alas! The wondrous wild-fire is gone out, indeed! The sweet hallucination at an end! The enchantment overâthe dark curtain fallen! Boy! boy! 'Tis destiny hath duped us both. The expiation of my guilty shame, So long deferred, is claimed from out the heav'ns. Go, do their bidding, this thy fate and mine. [Exit. (Lightning and loud thunder.) Scene 2. A chamber in the Castle discovers Bertrand, Notary, Appraiser, and others. 1st Cit. A rare old wine, this, Master Steward. It takes kindly to one, on the top of the pasty. Ber. No need to be sparing of it. Our cellar is rife and will bleed freely. You are all welcome, sweet sirs, so that you drink enough. No heel-taps, recollectâ 2nd Cit. Your master the Baron is, by account, a fine old brick. Pity Zachary has his clutch hereabout! Such liquor to stagnate in his keeping! Saints prevent it! Ber. You say truly. Fill up your goblet, friend. The Lord Soartes is no niggard host and, thank heaven! hath gold enough at command to appease the scurvy money-lender. Ap. A sudden turn of the wheel! Hath he found a mine on his estate? 'Tis excellent wine I allow, and these faggots blaze briskly; yet were the ready at hand, as you affirm, it would be common thrift in his lordship to patch the ceiling overhead and give yon grim pannellings a help to hold it together. Ber. The craziest rafters are likliest to betray treasure-pots, Master Appraiser! Not. Oho! so your master hath hit upon his redemption-money in this way. 'Tis of consideration, and may bring a trifle into our hands. Ber. Not so fast, sir Notary. Your head calculates to fee the fist with wind-coins. Come, come, pass the flagon. The wine is good as gold to those it loves, and good wine loves like a Christianâenemies as well as friends. Here comes the Baron's fledglingâa sweet-tempered youth in his own way. There's a cloud on his brow, I reckon, so be advised and avoid argument with him. His mode of dealing with contradiction is somewhat summary. (Enter Gonseres.) Gon. Wineâfaugh! it smells of puppies. Let Curs drink it. The very fumes do choke and stifle me. Here, Bertrand, hand me of thy special flask, A brimming bumperâgood, anotherâgoodâ [Drinks. One more. This is the beverage of gods! Your health in't, sirs. Not. Pardon me, young master. Wine like this is not to be belied and cast out of credit, so readily. 'Tis dishonour done to thy lord's cellar to refuse it the preference. [Aside. Gon. The paltry knave. Is written on his face. Friend, an advice! Don't meddle with folks' tastes, unless 'tis meant To thrust thyself into the heart of quarrel. Counsel and prose are poisoners at a feast, They choke its wit, drop wormwood in its wine, Its lights extinguish, freeze its promised warmth And so transform it to a funeral. Bertrand, be tutor to this man's discretion, Fill up his glass. 'Tis charity to melt So dry a natureâgive him swill to th'ears. [Exit. Ber. Yield me a judgment, Master Notary. My warning was not without reason? Yet, in honest truth, bringing experience to bear, you met with most lenient dealing. The foreboding of daggers was evident; but the upshot, not ungracious, considering. Hold yourself fortunate, my friend. Not. A very scape-grace, spoiled and sodden with indulgence. Ap. A bully, in every facet of the term! 1st Cit. A mouthing upstart! Not. The Baron's fledgling you termed him? Ber. So report saith. The paternal cross, I allow, is charily developed. It is betrayed, notwithstanding, on occasions. Put wings to the flagon, gentlemen. (Enter Soartes and Zachary.) My Lord Soartesâ Soar. Our worthy steward, Hath all the duties of a host performed To your content, good friends, I make no question. Come, Master Zachary, be prevailed upon To taste our wine and pledge these jovial cits, Your followers, by whom our humble board Is graced and honoured. Zach. This prodigality, my lord, is no matter of mine. You will have your jest, although you fall on the point of it. Your health Baron! and yours, gentlemen. A day of grace is but reasonable, yet by the beard of Isaac, the goodness of the grape almost tempts me to descend to the wine cellar and lay instant embargo upon its contents. Ber. God bless you sir, and you have no fear of the rats. Why! at this moment, they are out at foray in drovesâ huge-whiskered, ferocious looking rascals that have both tooth and stomach for anything, and were a lion itself fool-hardy enough to face them, would fly down his throat and disembowel him, before he could get his roar out. Besides, there is a nest of adders in the vault and a ghost âa white ghostâsir. Zach. Quite an attractive place. Let me have the key, by all means. Soar. Oblige him with it, Bertrand. Zach. Nay, nay, my lord, I have no design to destrain your wine-casks so unceremoniously. This old man's fiction is befitting his own lack of courage. To-morrow at mid-day, we shall proceed to take our inventory, and should that relief you so confidently look for make its appearance in the mean-time, it will give me infinite satisfaction to throw up all claims and obligations at present held by me over your lordship's estate, as well as to rid these walls of our very unpleasant company. Soar. You and your followers I have made welcome, And the best fare my frugal house affords, Placed at your bidding. Had I so resolved, This castle might have stood a lengthy seige Against a regiment of creditors. I could have filled the fosseâthe bridge withdrawn, Assorted the portcullis; to my aid All the contrivances of bold defence Invoked, and cast defiance in your teeth. Instead of this, my gates are thrown ajar, My hand extended. All I have made yours, Before the strict formalities of law Have so declared it; yet, while you partake, You disallow my hospitality. The grave assurance of the means at hand T'appease your claims, is held in question; I sue for the brief respite of a week Taxed with the entertainment of these cits, Yet this, the paltriest of favours, you Deny me. Zach. My Lord Soartes. To-day with you repeats the speech of yesterday, and the yesterday of your plaint and entreaties is not a recent one. Few words need pass betwixt us. To-morrow I have namedâto-morrow it shall be. Master Appraiser, take note of it and have a care that your head be cool and your hand steady. This wine, I fear, works mischief with both. The blame be mine! [Zachary exit. Soar. Bertrand, it is strange, my niece Hath not returned. Yourself apprised me That in the Lady Ella's company At noon, she had set out to enjoy the shade, In precincts of our park. It has of late Become her idle pleasure so to ramble; This I am bent to check and have despatched Gonseres to compel her presence hither, Without delay. Seven hours have since elapsed. To flinch from his instructions is unlike The worthy youth. Ber. Gonseres, my lord, has been here; indeed, he had just quitted the hall on your entrance. In a moody humour, I allow, he was, and tossed off a glass or two of strong waters with little ceremony. The Ladye Meranie's name was not mentioned by him. I noted that he carried no rapier and his attire as well as his spirits was somewhat discomposed. Had the weapon usually worn by him been at hand, this gentleman, I am persuaded, would have had reason to feel uncomfortable. Soar. I must see the youth. My niece No doubt has to her chamber hied and shuns Her guardian's presence. [Exit Soartes. Not. It is only reasonable to wish myself safely outside of these walls. Old Zachary hath a bold tongue, but I question that it would wag so freely, were the page, instead of the master, to come across it. The Baron Soartes appears suddenly to have made up his mind to something; and I don't like the look of matters, by any means. Ber. You a lawyer too! that would hug the devil himself in the shape of a client, and hast laid claim, no doubt, to a good slice of the invisible territory down stairs. Come fill up and pass the tankard! It has a habit of halting at your end of the board, much to our prejudice at this extremity. Not. I would rather that we marched direct to our night quarters, comrades; and you Master Appraiser, have a care of yourself. Our employer in this business, as you well know, is a man of his word and to forfeit the goodwill he hath shewn us by an act of indiscretion will not say much for our sagacity. Ap. I have neither heartache nor headache, Master Notary, and you have both, But if good-night is to be the wordâpass the tankard for a parting gulp. [Exeunt omnes. End of Act II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. Scene 1. A Chamber in the Castle discovers Soartes and Gonseres. Soar. To have drawn Your rapier on the Count was indiscreet, And of this indiscretion your defence, Save in one issue, wherefore I accept it, Lame and irrelevant. The fault is mine That placed the simple deputation In such rash hands. You have maintained at least The spirit and strict letter of your trust; Herein I give you credit. Yet, Gonseres, This soldier's virtue tempered not with prudence More oft betrays to sad discomfiture Than leads to triumph. I have overtasked you, Or on the self-control you boasted of Too much relied. Such soft credulity Has been my curse and beggaring. Look up, And tell me honestly, I do you wrong, And that the seal of our late interviewâ The promise and engagement of yourself To nobler service than a wilful girl's Are held inviolate. Gon. The pledge I gave I now renew. Scorned love has taught me scorn Of love itself. To-night the spell was broken That bound my senses. Soar. The disdain be thanked! Which so restores you to your proper self! Now I am re-assured. This ill-timed passion Had nigh distracted me. Oh, good Gonseres! stretch a helpful hand! The time is wasted to a single thread On which my credit and my honour hangâ Until to-morrow's noon, old Zachary Defers his purpose. This short interval Of grace is left me. Gon. Nay, my Lord Soartes, Wherein have I proved backward to assist In your behalf? Are not my services Pledged without reservation to the cause? Have I betrayed one breath of our design Or babbled aught against your loyalty? Have I impeded with dissuasive words The execution of this bold intent? I wait only direction from your lips To seize the jewels. Yet you move not in't, Nor say, âGonseres, these are your credentialsâ Such your instructionsâthis the key of trust.â Soar. That such impatience with my own accords Is fortunateâan omen of success! Two hours it lacks of midnight. In less time, Your horse discreetly urged may reach the city, There when arrived, the better to conceal Your true intent, leave message with the leech Regarding sudden ailment in the castle. Thence from his dwelling to the palace-yard Hie quickly, taking note of none that pass you. On the south side, that which o'erlooks the park You may have noticed, near the entrance gate, Three slabs of marble similar in height, All lettered over by barbaric chisel. The spot at night is dark and unfrequented Linked to a story of mysterious crime. Gon. The woful legend is familiar to me, And the position of each monument My mind's eye cherishes. Soar. The central slab Imbedded, as it seems to passers by, Immoveably within the solid wall, This key applied, turns inward on a hinge Forming a secret entrance to the palace. In the seventh rhythm of the inscription, At the commencement of the halting word, One may detect a small triangular cleft Which the contiguous tracings of the chisel So truthfully resemble, that the glance Of ablest antiquary shot across them, Would but account it as a point or letter, Essential to the meaning of the scroll. A finger run across the indented line Will help sufficiently to ascertain The aperture in question. Be regardful, Gonseres, to direct the subtle key Towards the left and to revolve it twice. This done, the lightest touch will cause the stone Swing backwards and afford you facile entrance To a paved arch-way, where arrived, reclose The feigned tablet with a cautious hand And into speedy play your lanthorn bring. To thread, without its guidance, the dark maze Of silent vault which to the jewel room Conducts, would sore perplex you. So equipped, Make instant use of the compliant flame T'assist your purpose. A few resolute steps Will lead you where the arch-way branches off In three directions. By the central hold. Forward as you advance, the lowering roof Compels a stooping posture. At one point, The current of the passage sharply turns The zig-zags upward by a narrow staircase, At top of which confronts you seemingly The solid wall. Here, by the lanthorn's light, You will discover near the landing stone An iron ring. This grasp and upwards lift; A pannel to the eye disguised as brickwork Will slowly yield, giving admittance scant To your slight person through the narrow gap: Brushing aside the mouldering tapestries That in the inner wall conceal its presence, You gain a lofty chamber, out of which, On the left hand, forming a small recess, The jewel room expands. A grated screen Protects its entrance. In this larger key, You hold the availing passport. Say, Gonseres, To your regardful ear, all is explicit, And that no shadow of uncertainty Hangs over you? Gon. Less clear the summer noon Than your instructions. With this chart to steer by, Success is ours. Two chimes shall not have rung, Before the princely treasure is secured. Ere dawn, by the assistance of my steed, I shall attain the frontier and apace, Hold with Balsido cautious interview. To cede the advantage By hasty disposition of the jewels Were to provoke suspicion: Soar. Take this ring, It hath a charm in't cannot fail to work Upon Balsido and engage his favour. One it belonged to, whom his memory Loves to recalâthe playmate of his youth. Say that Soartes sent it, by the wish On death-bed of his brotherâthat for years It had been reckoned lost, yet suddenly The other day cast up. A tale it is Not all bereft of truth which will ensure His courtesy and every surmise keep In the back ground. Yet considerate be, Gonseres, nor the demon of distrust Tempt with the blazing portion of our treasure; But let the modest unassuming pearlâ The common gems most easy to dispose of, Such as appear In keeping with our rank, Not the estate and garniture of kings Drop into play. Gon. It is high time, my lord, To be in the stirrup. This Balsido meets My apprehension. To your estimate And good report of him I pin all faith. By noon, to-morrow, you shall have the crowns, Three hundred thousand, say you, will repair The credit of your houseâappease the Jew And in the matter of your ward's estate Clear you from all enquiry? Soar. Spare no cost That may give wings to your return, Gonseres, But post it hither with relays of steeds At quickest gallop. Of the amount required, It is essential that one third at least Be rendered in the coinage of the realm; The rest to drafts and letters of exchange Will bear conversion. All good wishes guard And speed you on your errand! Gon. At noontide, To-morrow, look for me. Should I fail t'appear Hold it no token of calamity, Further than this, that to my will to serve you And good endeavour to encompass it, My life has fallen forfeit. Such event, Rest all assured, shall not endanger you, Though cruelest tortures appertain to it. [Gonseres exit. Soar. Forbid the thought. The boy is gone. Gonseres! [shouts. He answers not, but leaves this rack behindâ This worst of tortures. Good Gonseres! save me. Oh, fool I am; most credulous of foolsâ Gonseres! Must I goâentreat him back My own commissioned demon? Good Gonseres! He will not hear and yet is all distinct To my racked ear the echoe of his footsteps. Gonseres! treason!â (Enter Inora.) In. On a traitor's lips The word is apt. Soar. I am betrayed (shouts) Gonseres! In. Soartes! Soar. Who art thou? what purpose brings thee? In. Thou hast forgott'n me. True I am alter'd! Time, poverty, seclusion, penitence, The skathing fires of madnessâall have altered. This much the mirror of the brook hath told me. I am not now a toy to win the eye Decked out by nature with soft blandishments And moulded for desire. Look on my brow! Tell me with flattering tongue 'tis fair as morn, Tell me my cheek is sweeter than the roseâ My hair as glossy as the raven's plumeâ My eyes the sources and the soul of lightâ My voice a fountain of soft melodyâ My form all graceâmy step all elegance; This froth feed now my ear with, if thou wilt, Spare not thy former self anew to win meâ It is not here, in the thin skin of things The change doth lurk. Soar. Who art thou, woman? Why here? who gave thee entrance? In. Who am I? Who feigns all ign'rance of me but best knows me? Why here? why not? within my promised home, To claim the consummation of thy vows? Who gave me entrance? To these crazy walls, At every chink and port hole there's a welcome, Of which the howling winds avail themselves, And I storm-driven pass with them. Soar. This is strange! Declare in simple terms thyself and purpose. In. Must I believe it? Am I thus forgotten? Or dost thou feign this lordly ignorance To suit th'occasion? Am I forgotten That needed all thine art to overcomeâ Whom protestations of enduring faith Entreaties, gilded words and sophistries, Only a subtle demon could employ, Were brought to triumph o'er? Is she forgotten And all the lavish labour of thy lust Made none account of? Soar. A stale, sorry trick! In the impostress you would sink the spyâ They are one calling. In. Oh! most vile dissembler! Deal eye to eye and tongue to tongue with me, And on thy knightly oath acquit thyself Of recognition. Are these forgeries? [Produces a packet of letters. Wilt thou disclaim themâseal and signature! With all the tender gist of their contents? This trinket too, gemmed with an emerald! [Shews a ring. Now, when thou hop'st to sate thy jewel chest With kingly glitter, does thy memory Refuse to know it? Oh! my Lord Soartes Say! am I all forgotten? Soar. What is your purpose That you betray me at this time and place By such appeal and earnest questioning? To rip up all the follies of my youth?â Allowedâthat these attest we were familiar, Bandied kind words and tokens of regard, Nay! that eternal constancy was vowed Betwixt us. What of this? Are you alone? A single sufferer in the cause of loveâ Sole claimant on my heart, its chosen mistress? Alone the privileged sharer of my bed And honoured casket of my chastity, That now, forsooth, you vex me to avow So out of date a passion? Know you not, It is the high prerogative of love And at its court the lawful form and practice Of oaths and soft professions to make light, And gracious-spoken perjuries employ To win our ends with? In. Love is ever truth; Nor in its court, but that of faithless lust Lives toleration of such infamy. Oh! thou dost rob true love of all its truth And truth of all its fairest loveliness! Soar. Am I bewitched that I do trifle thus With the occasion? By thy plain avowal, Thou'rt privy to our secretâart a spyâ A base, immodest, surreptitious spy That to the shoulders of my venial sins Shiftest the charge of thine own treachery. 'Tis a rash moment thou hast taken to bait Me in and thwart the bend of my resolve, On thy presumptuous self, the blame abide! [Soartes draws a dagger. In. Why! gracious heav'n! did no kind star forewarm me! Are all calamities but love's revealed? And Iâam I but one of many victims, Levell'd with others to their base degree, Who hung upon this man's persuasion And for the honied words of flattery Yielded the priceless portion of themselves? A spy thou say'stâa traitress? oh! 'tis wellâ We are at last on equal termsâSoartes! See, I am armed [Draws a dagger. As well as thou and have as fit a spiritâ The better causeâmore crying wrongs to avenge! A timorous woman! I am not so nowâ Feeble! this limbâthese sinews! Look at them. They are no coaxing and caressing girl's! Measure them with thine ownâstretch me thy hand, Thou dar'st not; yet thou threat'st me with thy mouth, A coward's tongue! Art thou indeed Soartes? The lord Soartesâonce my bosom's lord? I question it. Oh! never art thou him, Else, in my trance of joy, I am disturbed, And all before me is despair indeed! Soar. Inora! speak not thusâ In. Inoraâha! He has confessed meâlook! be sure I am The true Inora and no vile impostress Regard me well! I am a spyâa traitress, Limbed like a manâarmed like a ruffian. Inora was a womanâtender, lovingâ The incarnation of a hundred graces: Weapon, her simple nature dreamt not of, Even as a defence, so trustful she! Inora! no! no more than thou'rt Soartes Am I Inora! Time hath chang'd us bothâ Thee manhood hath forsak'nâme, my girlhood,â Thee all that seem'd of worthâme all that was. Soar. Indeedâthe change is sad! In. Oh, hypocrite! Not thou, but that ideal paragon I did create from thee to feed my soul with That fancied Bayard of thy sex is changedâ Thou art the same,âfalse, crafty, cowardly, A faithless guardian, to thy king a traitor! Soar. Inora! In. To my cast off name, appeal notâ Call me by any other that thou willest I, IâInora? I tell thee, every letter is attainted. Doth my sun-chafed and swart complexion Remind thee of her? Is this rugged form Her living counterpart whom none excelled That ever chisel fraught? Impossible! Thou knewest me, but as a paramourâ A spyâa traitress! I am all of these And worthier of thee now that I had deem'd, Count up the summers that have parted us; They number half my life-time. After all, It is no marvel I was thus forgotten; These twenty years, a vow did bind me to't, I lent thee not a chance of recognition. The purpose of my heart was generous, I left thee to forget me. 'Twas not meet That the fair house and lineage of Soartes Should vex itself with base alliances. To be thy mistress longer I did spurn, Yet, more abhorr'd myself than my seducer. Nay! while I thus forsook him, to endure My term of penance, in my heart, I kept His image undefeatured. Not a tear Reproached thee, not a passing thought dishonoured And when of thy reverses it was whispered, I tasked my brain with projects of relief. Alas! o'ertasked it. Traitress, thou hast call'd me, Thou, of all others!â'Tis a name well-earned, Aptly deserved and timeously bestowed. In the same barkâon the same stormy sea, We sail together,âI am thine accomplice, The mother of Gonseres, thou his father! Soar. Inora! In. Still, Inora! Patienceâhear me! Gonseres is our sonâa bond betwixt us! For both, 'twere better far no bond had been, And that the breath of heav'n passed unobstructed, Yet flesh and bone and blood, he, is our offspring. Soar. An hour ago, had you but told me this. What reparationâ In. Reparation? marriage is it? I'd as lief The festering shackles of perdition wear Oh! mockery! now, and with thee, Soartes Name it not. Soar. It is but simple justice to Gonseres. In. Gonseres! thou speak'st truth, thou plead'st for him Thou art Soartes stillâno traitor thou! Oh! I remember well, thy very dogsâ The scourings of thy kennel shamed his mother. 'Twas by heaven's ordinance that this was done, So the accusing angel might have scope Within her bosom, at all times to rend it. Fool, fool, thou hast considerate points about thee That make me tender-souled, spite of myself. Thou lov'st Gonseres and hath trusted him, As one that in return would not betray thee. A rare confederacy there is among us! Sire, son, and motherânoble, bastard, harlot!â The king would laugh his sides out, did he dream That such crazed ladders are set up on end To climb with to the throne's high pinnacle And dispossess him of his vaunted crown. Soar. No longer torture meâno further mock me! Say, is Gonseres true? In. I trained him not, How should I know him better than yourself? Soar. It needed but to wield a mother's sway To be his confident. Thou hast by heart Our purpose; all its bearings thou art versed in. In. Keep doubt aloof; it is too late to doubt, If you distrust him, there is this choice left you, To th'utmost corners of the earth escape; Or else, betray him with thy perjured tongue And as accomplice in the crime on hand To torture and to axe, to rack and wheel, (I have gone through more fiery ordeal) Commit and doom thy cast-off paramour, But one alternative remains behind. Good night, sweet rest to you, my bosom's lord, As I came here, I go. The tapestries And wainscotings are gaping for repair, May no worse phantom stealing through their rents Disquiet youâsweet restâmy loving lord. [Inora exit. Soar. (shouts) Bertrand, ho, Bertrand! (Enter Bertrand.) Preciousest of knaves, Sworn to keep vigil at our castle gates, What ails thee? Art thou moonstruck? dazed with drink? Where are the fellows that should do our bidding? Speak,âmake account of this strange negligence And not stand shaking thine old palsied head And muttering invocations to the Saints. Ber. Oh! my dear lord and master! that I should live to see what I have seen, all within the day's passing and below the roof I was born under, three-score and ten years ago. With the old ghost of the house I have hob-nobbed many a timeâa hearty old cock that kept crowing over our casks by moonlight, and did them a turn of justice, on occasions of family jubilee. What of late hath come of it, I wot not; but this new devil in gipsy guise hath a turn in the eye like a wild cat's and can scratch, I warrant you. How Jose the warder shewed heel and shrieked God o' mercy! as the jade pushed by himâ Soar. To roost, old croaker! but See to our bed-room that 'tis well appointed; A roaring fire and brandy by the bucket! Mind, leave the key inside, and when Gonseres Returns, apprize me on the instant. Knock Like a sledge hammer. [Exeunt. End of Scene 1. Scene 2. Dark Chamber in the Palace. (Gonseres alone.) Like the breath Of humid dragons in their charnel dens Whose fingered fumes work upward to men's throats And strangle all the senses of sweet life, So labours the gross air of this drear place. Is't possible He hath inveigled me by his feign'd compliance Into those mazy and mysterious vaults T'insure my silence and alone, masked in His rank, his age and past fidelity, Clutch up the treasure? A fool's fancy this! Such daring to put hand to is not in His abject nature; nor to purpose it Befits the unhinged condition of his fortunes. Yon ray of distant light breaks cheerily And all the thronging spectres of distrust Retreat into their sullen crevices. The diamond of diamonds is lightâ The eye of all things rare and radiantâ Their arbiter and their artificer. These walls grow friendly under its kind magic And seem familiar to my apprehension As I advance. Ha! the key Leaps to its office, like a thing bewitched And in the ear of the obedient lock Drops its persuasive whisper. [Opens the casket. A rare stone Filched from the gleaming quarries of the sun By some bold searcher of infinitude! 'Tis pity that a gem of such renown Should be decreed to dark forgetfulness. No, no, Soartes, I have found a service Pertaining to it which befitteth more My humour and its fortunes than thou dream'st of. Earth's lap hath treasures hoarded in't enow, To need such acquisition. Oh! this jewel Hath wrought but half its destiny. Too long It hath lain buried at the king's caprice Which holds it in disfavour, as a charm Linked with rebellion and calamity. Now, it must forth to supplement its fame And do the bidding, braving royal decree, Of the stern fates. Both, both it shall involve Her and the haughty Count. Pity henceforth Be banished from my bosom! Come Revenge! Come Hate! come every fiendish form And take up room in't! There is space enough For all the drifting demons of despair To harbour here. I now devote, before you, This jewel to the cause of scorned love! Aid me, avenging spirits! Let my wrongs Work out their expiation, so that kings When to their privileged, anointed brows Reclimbs the fatal star-stone, shall allot To the red legend of Gonseres' love, A place in its eventful history. [Exit Gonseres.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. Scene 1. Wood fronting Count Vicents's Castle. Meranie and Count Vicente. (Meranie sings.) [Gonseres enters and conceals himself. Joy of all joys is to be, Leaning on, listening to thee, Listening to thee and the dove, Leaning, brave heart, on thy love, On the right arm of Valour and Love! Joy of all joys is to know Thou art true, let the tide ebb or flow Let the daylight arise or declineâ To know, noble heart, I am thine, Joy of all joys to be thine! (Gonseres from his concealment.) Oh! happy birds that nestle in these boughs And in the pleasant cadences of song Are perfected by such an apt instructress! I would I were a listener with you, As grateful, uninvidious, innocent, Moved to no evil, prompted by no devil. This winged felicity is not my fateâ Therefore I serve the bidding I am bound to; Therefore, I quench, love being quenched, all pity;â Therefore, I hate and will have hatred felt; Therefore, I hoard and multiply revenge, Until it oversatisfies its purpose. [Vicente and Ladye Meranie pass. Proud Count! how comes this narrow world to hold thee? Proud ladye! why into the bend of heaven Among the emulous stars not stretch thy neck And the disdain of these sweet eyes cloud up Against my reckoning? Must I halt and turnâ Yield all to one relenting of the hour And go, my nails gnaw in a monastery To give your loves their licence? Owe and pay! This is the usage of the honest world, And I shall hold to it. Scorn! a heart scorned! Insult! no end of it! So huge a debt I owe you and with interests shall pay it. How simple to put this good shaft to use On such an errand! Tempter! urge me not To settle in the twanging of a bowstring So large a load of liabilities. No, no, the careful hoardings of revenge At intervals and by degrees built up Are of more moment than to be imperilled At one rash venture. [Vicente and Meranie re-pass. Vic. My own sweet countess, rest not on the thought Nor let it cloud our honeymoon of love. Mer. Nay! dear Vicente, read with lenient eye And thou wilt find accordant to its cheer And smiling import my reflecting self; Express but joy and hold me joy as well, In thy serenity I walk serene: Betray sad thoughts: Alas! a poor consolerâ I cannot stave the infection of their sadness, But share it with thee. Vic. Oh! then, anxiety Forsake my brow! for thee alone I feared And from these grave, sweet looks, construed and shaped My apprehensions, dearest Meranie! Mer. My guardian's absence, but his silence more Have, I allow, upon my wonder drawn. The why he honoured not our nuptial feast In person, as my guardian and kinsman. Our neighbour and thy fathers ancient friend? Yet, this omission I am fain to excuse And count it fortunate the bridal board Was not thus honoured. Still, that he is silent And to our courteous invitation Hath vouchsafed no return, perplexes me, The curtest note couched in the stiffest terms More grateful were than such undue reserve, So might I still regard him as a man Not altogether dead to charityâ As the fond uncle whom an adverse hand Compelled to cruel and ungracious acts Against his better nature. Vic. The regard Thou would'st persuade thyself survives in him, More aptly by his silence is exprest Than by the phraseology of form,â Those cold, hard words, like hailstones of the north. That smite and lacerate the tender heart. Mer. Oh! such I dream't not of, nor thought to have Returned upon us in acknowledgment. Better and kinder were an age of silence Than such return. A sad and grievous change Hath overtaken my kinsman. Yet, dear lord! The past persuades me with a lenient eye To look upon his later frailties And make concessions to declining years, Lost health and that infirmity of mind His waning fortunes are conspired to compass. [Vicente and L. Meranie pass. (Gonseres, armed with bow and arrow, affixes a small casket to the head of the shaft, and thus soliloquises.) Gon. 'Tis opportune. The casement stands agape, My demon beckons on me. Do thine errand! (fits the arrow to the bow and draws; the arrow with its appendage entering the apartment.) There is the dower I promised to thy bride, Proud Count! 'twill purchase thee and her a throne If thou hast wit to use it for this end. My mother, who is skilled in divination, Avers a scaffold glimmered on its facets, The likelier ending to your mated loves. [Exit. Scene 2. Apartment in Count Vicente's Castle discovers Ladies Ella and Meranie. Ella. My confident no longerâ Mer. But thy sister. Ella. It satisfies. I have thy confidence, Thou mine, as much as needful. The new bond Uniting us, does of necessity Alter the former compact of our hearts, Only in this, that the sweet trust you gave To my weak self is now transferred to one More worthy its reception. Mer. Say not so, The worth in both excels. I have no secrets Vicente would deny thee, dearest Ella! Ella. And I no wish of his prerogative To be the usurper; no, dear Meranie! Thy husband's claim I yield all rev'rence to And would not rob him of a jot of honour, To be entrusted with the king's confessions, Which, by the bye, they say, he has his say in, But they who say it are invidious folks. True loyalty insinuates no wrong Of kings that err, but helps to amend their state, And failing, shields their virtues from reproach, If these they have to excuse their follies with, At no such crisis is our noble monarch! Mer. Live in your lips his glory and defence! To-morrow is the birth-day of the Prince His heir, and, if God spares, the throne's successorâ A noble youth, illustrious, not less By virtue of his graces and acquirements Than the renown of his great ancestors. Ella. The annual fete which to the event is linked, On this the year of his majority With greater pomp and prodigal display Will be enacted, so says rumour's tongue, While 'mong the guests which royalty hath honoured With its command to grace the banquet hall Are named the Count Vicente and his bride. Mer. This gracious and considerate mark of favour Has been acknowledged with due courtesy. In virtue of your post, as maid of honour, You too, dear Ella, to these palace revels Are welcomed and will bear us company. A source of some regret unto my lord Is the detention of an ornament Intended for my use which he had sent To be refitted by the jeweller. For its own sake, I place no heart on it, But yet for his, would give it constant place Upon my heart. Here comes he all relieved, And with a face of joy! Welcome, dear lord, The bauble has arrived? Vic. In truth, fair heart! Its lesser stars are all rebuked to shame; I care not how unpunctually they lag. Here is a diamond fallen out of heaven To grace the bosom meetest for it on earth! A rarer stone has never filled the gaze With its perfections, flawless as a seraphâ Watered from out the highest firmamentâ Shaped so as to refract its innate light A thousand ways and win a thousand eyes. Ella. Tempt not our patience longer, brother dear, But to this miracle be justice done; And let its good renown find listeners. If, in this casket, lies the jewel you rave of, Undo its fasteningsâbid the soul peep out And our expectant eyes illuminate. Vic. Oh, Ella! you that pride your simple self On being above the failings of your sex, Are but a woman still, impatient, curious, As fond of shining gew-gaws as the rest. Ella. That by the rapture of your speech, Vicente, Touching this gem of gems, I am persuaded, Betrays no great excess of frailty. As natural it is for boastful man, Thus moved, to waive all starched discretion And to the throbs of curiosity, Tender obedience, as for simple woman. [Vicente opens the casket. Vic. Truly, a marvellous jewel! No eulogy From poet's lips, could give it tithe of justice. Mer. To whose potential favour, my dear lord, Trace you this princely token of esteem? Vic. I am bewildered, love. Ella. The stone is one that royalty itself Might envy. By such pertinents are thrones Propped and accredited. To acquire and hold them Is duty more than privilege in a king. They are the life and good repute of empires And for the follies and imprudences Of those that govern are atoning pledges, This is no monarch's gift, brother Vicente! Not thus the heart's-blood of our palace courts Is shower'd away. Mer. 'Tis strange munificence, And of a strange and questionable source, Seeing that royalty hath no hand in it. I pray you, my dear lord, the mystery solve, How came this jewel? by what messenger? With what accompaniment or note of hand? Vic. To affirm that from the generous stars it dropt, In this our radiant honeymoon of love, Might gain excuse, as a poetic freedom; Yet, in her ear so to exaggerate Were to insult my sweet, confiding marrow. How came into these hands a gift so rare Is simply told. On entering my study, An hour ago, the jewel lay before me Secured by silken ribbon to an arrow Which, further, on its shaft a label bore Of penmanship unclerkly, purporting In curt and formal terms, the donor's wish, That to my countess, as a bridal gift, This diamond unquestioned should pass, And wishing her all opportunity And health to wear it. Mer. What good friend I owe So rich a favour to, my loving lord! All comprehension baffles. No kind eye, Save this devoted sister's and your own Hath so beamed on me, since my girlhood's dawn, As to betoken a chance gift of love, Costlier than common courtesies. A windfall, Such as this is, all reason contradicts, Each past experience, every sense of merit; So lavish is it, yet so modestly, In shame of form and disrespect of thanks, Placed at our bidding. Does no clue remain By which to trace the giver? Vic. One and all Of our domestics I have straightly questioned, But nothing ascertained which helps to guide Further inquiry. No one, they agree, Hath passed the approach, since sunrise. To my study, The open casement, it is true, gave access, Through which the arrow with its precious freight, Aimed by no trembling or unpractised hand, Found passage, sole intruder.â Ella. Strange indeed! By all the freaks of fortune unexcelled! That ancient mariner of Arabian fame Sinbad eclypt, henceforward, may resign The right hand of the goddess. They reck not, Who at the morrow's regal festival Are bent to poison half the world with envy, How their high projects will be overset By the display of this bright cynosure. Mer. Ella, dear Ella, you o'ertake my purpose, This peerless wonder to appreciate And meet the morrow's world with, all at once, Accords not with the longings of a heart So fully satisfied. I am, as yet, The simple and unpractised courtierâ Scarce trained to encounter the gay mirror's face And check the intruding scarlet. To acquit Myself erect and as my natural self, Before our august monarch and his queen My inborn courage is my honest help; This I could do, and no one say I failed In dignity and self-possession; But thus bedecked with half a kingdom's costâ Invidious eyes pursuing every stepâ The mark of shafts from every rancorous tongue,â Thronged in and of this jewel's history Entreatedâin what era of the past, It oped its lucid eye? what Pagan sands Evolved it? whose the high barbaric brow It first adorned? a thousand questions Touching its acquisition thrust on me, The bare idea carries torture with it. Vic. My gentle countess, your discretion guide you! This diamond that so perplexes us By its surpassing beauty and the mode, So strange, by which 'tis thrust on our acceptance, Has all the seeming of a royal favour. The jewels that do prop the throne are men, The wise and valorous, not, as Ella deems, A hoard of shining stones. Our generous king Hath delicate and unpretentious tact In shedding his awardsâesteeming oft The slightest service too, of higher worth Than those esteem who render it. 'Tis true, This gift brings no equivalent to mind, Save it be thy sweet virtues that have winged Their fragrant way into the royal presence; Yet to acknowledge it, is our privilege And bounden duty. How it best becomes To speak the thanks we owe, reason doth teach, As well as usage. Faithful courtiers Hold it a simple act of loyalty To wear their stars and decorations In presence of the king. This diamond Announcing by its costliness, the source It came from, should be so esteemed And proffer'd to the eye of majesty As a due recognition of his favour And high regard. To-morrow's national feteâ The birth-day of the throne's apparent heir, For this acknowledgement and loyal duty The occasion offers. My sweet Meranieâ Will hail the early opportunity And on her graceful self bear gracefully The royal favour. Mer. You have won me to it, More by persuasion than by argumentâ More by desire to chime with your desire, My loving lord, than from release of thought Suspicious of this gift and its bestower. [Exeunt. End of Scene 2. Scene 3. A Street in the City. Gonseres and Inora meet. Gon. Thou, mother, in the city;âthe wood-raven Among the parrots! Thou! my wholesome dame On the parade of fashion? Do I see Aright, or are my senses all distraught? What demon hath compelled thee from thy den To scare the crowd with evil-omened brow And this a holiday? See! how they quit The balconiesâthose nurs'ry groups that wait Th'advancing pageant. Thou hast the evil eye And spoil'st the good folks mirth. Let us aside And leave these youngsters to recover heart. We play the mar-sport in this spectacle. In. What parson, boy, hath driven the devil out And made a milk-sop of thee? Hast thou taken To some fresh love-suit to be baulked anewâ And constru'st me into a school-girl's bugbear Would chase the crimson from some pretty cheek? Stay here!âI came to see this pageant, lad, Not to bewitch and frighten silly chits; I came to take a farewell peep at things. This was my girlhood's hauntâthat house, my home, Thence, from yon balcony, I first beheld Your sireâthe Lord Soartes. Those young brats, No wonder the contagion of our presence, Brings terror with it to their timid faces! I am their aunt. See!âthe attraction holdsâ A trembling hand and now a pallid brow Divides the curtainâtwoâthreeâall at once, Its minds me of old times. Let us move on. Thou'rt right, Gonseres! where my shadow falls Mirth flies. I had no thought of this. Gon. Nor I, Nay, nayâabide one moment. Pity 'tis, Now I have found this cousin-ship, to give So quick a go-bye to it. [Flourish of trumpets. Hark! 'tis music!â The state procession will be here anon; These door-steps promise a good point of view From which to observe it. In. Did I say, Gonseres, I came to see this pageant? Ay, did I! But not the bauble's self. I came to find My Lord Soartes here, propped by our handsâ Rebuilt in his estateâfree as of yore T'associate with the haughtiest of the realm, I came to mark him in his equipageâ The monarch's favourite and admire the scheme That helped him back to fortune. Gon. Tush! thou'rt mad. In. Mad! trueâoblivious of my former self, It is a madness of its sort, sweet bud; For thirty years I have not passed this way And yet it seems the common thoroughfare Which I am used to travel. Every spot Is rife with the events of yesterday. See, seeâmy brother's fledglings are grown bold. The music hath inspirited them. They are back Towards the balconyâtheir necks at stretchâ Their eyes intent to catch the cavalcade. How quickly the pert youngsters have thrown off Their shyness. It was thus, on such a day Of royal parade, Gonseres, that I first Beheld the Lord Soartes. Fate is just! Why am I here to-day? why thou? why these Our kinâall at this ominous spot convened But to give fate its due? He comesâthey come, Nay, man, throw back thy mantle, shew thyself. Thy sire and fellow robber rides in state Behind his sovereignâmated with his peers. 'Tis time that the self-same effrontery Should deck the uncovered brows of his accomplice. Let us stare out this trial of our virtue And none will dare affront us. The king smiles And to the heir presumptive of his throne Jestingly turns. We are set down as loyal. [Procession passes. Gon. A doubtful inference! plausibly come to. Thou'rt versed in court-craft, as thou wert in nursing, Good mother!âRegal levity implies Aroused suspicions. Smiles are oft with kings The gleam of daggers from their sheathes provokedâ A beckoning and instruction to the headsman. In. 'Tis majesty hath awed thee so to speak. Here comes Soartes; mark him! He looks up To my old post. Ha! how he winces. See! That girl's resemblance moves and overcomes himâ I in his thoughts am uppermost at last. Turn head this way, my bosom lordâthis wayâ Seek refuge here. 'Tis a convenient thing To have two sides to look to. NayâI meant not So to have startled thee. Gonseres!âprop meâ I have not a reed's strength in all my frame, Lend me a shoulderâboy! thy staffâ Gon. Hold on! The heaviest heart that ever anguish loaded Presses as lightly on me, as a feather: Mother is't thou with thy defiant soul? My grave, ambitious damâmy love-condemnrix,â My hating, cruel, cold, sarcastic mother? Is't thou that moot'st the matter of scorned love And tremblest under it? Go-bye!âgo-bye! Who taunted me? who bade me shew myself And brave this holiday? Who urged it all?â Painted the traitor's crime in hues of virtue And to the cause of treason, plighted troth? Who spake of love as glory's hinderance And chided the surrenderings of nature? Come! lean on me with resolution! The sturdiest oak of boastful Albion, Now that the Count Vicente meets my eye, Is but a twig in strength. Bear upâmy old one: Our life's best spectacle is yet to come! [Vicente passes. See mother! this is he that wears my jewel.â The courtly lord that smells my jessamineâ The insolent, disdainful of your cub, Who with his hunting thongâ'tis years agoâ Years have have not laid the soreâstruck here and stung. Well! I am calm, now to recount all this And he before me blazing with renown. All thisâand more, good mother! which you know of Hath your degenerate bastard overpassed. His sire's poor blood within his veins begs way, Blended, if not with red, maternal gore So thick and spicy as thy heart-springs yield, With creams instead, drawn from the pup-reft hound To which thy gracious love commended me, Such breeding is of some account, in faith! Or why am I this prodigy of patience? Why should I halt for the catastrophe With dagger sheathed and not determine it? Why be so timid in such braggart guise? So unaudacious, when 'tis opportune To take revenge? I am a dastard loon Beside the bravo, who, gild but his palm, Jumps at a job of blood. The screw is loose Somewhere, good mother, in my mechanism. Be the fault whose it mayâthine or Soartes' Or else my surly nurse's or all threeâ I hav'nt the open courage which wronged men Pride themselves in, nor yet the hireling's daring Which for a petty coin, engages him In the pale rider's service. [Exeunt. Scene 4. Another Street in the City. (Enter two Citizens.) 1st Cit. Joy fills the province, not a heart therein But throbs with it, from that which agitates The regal pulse down to the drudging peasant's. Old age and buoyant youth participate Together in its kindling extasy. Look yonder at that merry-making group, How the delirium of the festive hour Hath overtaken and assorted it Blending its motley features into one Benign expression of felicity! 2nd Cit. By this emotion of prevailing joy Is the good spirit of allegiance tried. The concord which upholds our festivals, More than the stirring sympathies of war Argues the State's well-being [Enter King, procession, &amp;c. with flourish of trumpets. Omnes. Long live the King! Long live Prince Amored! King. Thanks! and God bless you all Our loving people!âTo your loyal hearts We owe the calm and sunshine of the realm, Its biding peace and fair prosperity. Our throne has been exalted by your virtuesâ Our sway and territorial boundaries Propped by your valour. Thanks to all! Omnes. Long live the King! God bless our sovereign! King. A happy people! happy is its prince! Again we thank you with a prouder heart, Made prouder by the utterance of your love. Omnes. Long live the King! King. May such strong loyalty Survive us long and to our kingdom's heir Prove his best shield and weapon of defence. To-day, reliant on your high regard, We crave, on his account, a patient moment Wherein to recommend him to your favour And the exuberance of your love entreat In his behalf. Refuse not to the son, Our throne's successor, the allegiance You duteously have tendered to his sire; But let him in your favour blend with us, So shall all after duty to your sovereign, At our decease, be leavened with delight And the condition of the kingdom prosper. All. Long live the King! Long live Prince Amored! King. With length of days high heaven hath honoured me. Nor in their course withheld or limited The dewfall of its blessings. God be thanked For the sweet mercy of prosperity, Which hath been handmaid of so long a lifetime And still attends us, vigorous as ever! Although December snows enwrap our headâ Our sight be clouded and our blood nigh frozen, This boon of heaven hath waned not with our waning But more than mere surviving us, increases. The offering of a monarch is his peoples', Therefore, together, let us offer thanks For this sweet mercy! All. Long live our monarch! King. Courteous lieges! yield Indulgence to your grey-haired sovereign Whom the infirmities of life persuade. To delegate the cares of government To younger hands. No stranger is our son Among you, and no alien to your love. The instructions of our estimable menâ Scholars and worthies, in his grateful mind Shew promise of rich harvest, History,â The usages of men have been his studyâ All arts, industrial and elegant. Nor is he a raw tyro and untried In war, but with your valiant selves hath shared The perils and glory of our late campaign. To us he has been all things, as a son, His very life suspended on our wishes; Duty and love are so agreed in him They form one virtue. In his mother's eyes, The aspect nature gave him is our own: In our fond vision, he is doubly prized, Being the image of our loving consort. Excuse us, loyal sirs, that we have hung So long upon the promise of our throne, So glibly have his many graces dealt on, And to your ears built up a man complete Fitter to sway the empire than his sire. All. Long live the King! King. No stranger to your fealty we imposeâ No substitute that shall supplant ourselvesâ No base intruder on our own free soilâ No corrupt bastard with corrupting blood! Regard him as a fellow-subject still, Yet sharer with ourselves in palace caresâ The heir apparent to our high estate Apprenticed to the toils of sovereignty. All. Long live Prince Amored! King. From your approval of my pet resolve I draw both augury and inferenceâ An augury of welfare to my kingdomâ The inference that love and loyalty Glow in your generous bosoms and give promise To compass and defend the kingdom's heir. To-night it is our purpose (as it has been Though secret kept, these many passing years,) From the strict rigour of an early vow, Made in an hour of dire perplexity To liberate ourselves and our successors. By tenor of this oath, as you all know, Our crown and sceptre, the regalia Which on great state occasions played their part And with our kingdom's history are blent, Have in abeyance lain, since the demise Of our illustrious sire. The Lord Soartes, A trusty and leal-hearted nobleman, Holds them in keeping. From his special charge Now that the prejudice is dying out Which linked them with disaster and mishap, It is our settled purpose to release them. To the custodier of this onerous trust Our letters of relief will welcome prove, Leaving intact, as they are framed to do, His annual perquisites. We now give order, Touching the liberation of these jewels, That once more they confront the eyes of men And in our palace and the senate house Enact their part. To-night's great festival Invites to blend with it all lustrous aids And in the restoration of the pomp, Which to our court pertains as well as camp, The opportunity presents itself. My Lord Soartes! it is our good pleasure That the regalia of this noble realm Grace to-night's banquet. Soar. 'Tis my pride and duty To hold my sovereign's pleasure at command; Yetâmay I pleadâ King. Nay! let it not distress you, My worthy and revered counsellor! To what extent the setting of our jewels Hath ta'en on tarnish. Man's imperfect work Time takes his pleasure withâsoils and disfiguresâ Only to shew where true perfection liesâ So in the embroidery of these diamonds Artistic in design, eye-taking once And spoken of as something marvellous, The accidents which rob them of their charms Exalt their wearers and more brilliant make And costlier to the eye, the gems encased. Nor does it need these to resuscitate And bid shine forth in all their pristine lustre More than the flourish of a page's hand Armed with a lady's kerchief. Spider-weft And dust may for a season muffle up The face of things eternalâay!âof souls, And reputations which are fixed as stars, Yet in its day, their value will break forth And the cloud pass which threatened with extinction. But go, Soartes, give its grace to duty:â This signet will secure a guard of honour, And it is meet that some formality Should wait the resurrection of these jewels. [Exeunt. Scene 5. Room in the Palace discovers two courtiers. 1st. The king can do no wrong, is an old saying Which finds acceptance with all honest men Only the disaffected and disloyal Pervert it, as the devil does the scripture. The virtue negative ascribed to thrones Is now made positive. The king does right, And loyalty expands. 2nd. This turn of things Comes late, but better late than not at all. The self-denial of our sovereign Upon his lieges (throw the court aside), Hath tak'n effect unwholesome, and the air Charged with dissension and fanatic gloom. Such coming from the throne have been the force And sequel of example; and to stay The progress of the evil, only he That set it first a-going can prevail: Therefore of all things opportune and welcome Is this return to reasonable customs. The etiquette dispensed with and parade Are to our kingdom's life essential. They make of consequence its royal head,â Exalt his peers, bring courtesy to play In every circle, give our armies strength And the significance which keeps in awe, While it diverts, the shifty populace. A monarch to be monarch must keep up The customs of the CÃ¦sars and put on With the demeanour of a god, his harness, And that grand nature which the great God hath Of being, beyond the power to estimate, Munificent and prodigal of pleasures. This is the secret of imperial success! And now that the traditions of our realm And its regalia, so stirring once, Have become drivel and a nursery tale, It is high season to resuscitate The glories which monarchical caprice Sought to annihilate. 1st. How the spirit catches That breaks the stiff neck of the Puritan And melts the people to their ruler's humour! More by his dazzling than his hazy moods, The sun maintains his grand supremacy; So in the case of kings: Magnificence In state blent with munificence in action Carries the day. 2nd. We meet again to-night, And shall have opportunity to speak Our minds out on this sudden turn of things. The Count Vicente, I incline to think, Takes prominent hand in't. [Exeunt. Scene 6. Outside the Palace. [Enter Gonseres cloaked. Gon. (solus.) To the right track and purpose of my mind I am restored. The raven and its croak Are more becoming in the forest's heart Than in the city. 'Twas contagious, This leaking out of courage. Mother, mother! Mover and would-be marplot in our scheme, From thy dissuasion I must hold aloof; We are on different tacks. Thy tigress heart Hath pulp in itâa remnant. To infect me With its soft leanings is to take from me My nature and the vengeance I am sworn to. 'Tis not desired that we should meet again. A cub estranged from the maternal milk Is dangerous crossingâ (Enter Soartes.) You keep punctual faith. 'Tis well, my Lord Scartes, and expedient, I shall be present at the fete to-night. Soar. You! Be advised, Gonseres! Gon. I have cast With yours my fortunes and shall swim or drown Along with you. Soar. My faithful servitor! For zeal in my behalf I give you credit; A brave accomplice you have proved and trusty; But is it meet or prudent, at this crisis, To keep the game up? Of th'apportioned fruits Which crowned our enterprise, the costlier share, Is in your keeping, let it so remain, The terms be these,âHenceforth, we meet no more. Gon. My Lord Soartes, at the fete to-night I purpose to be present. The terms you urge Require to be considered, and to-morrow Is soon enough to bargain for my exile; But at this fete, I am resolved to be. Soar. What fiend of curiosity hath taken Possession of you, lad? You are no courtier Nor versed in courtly ceremonialâ Are rude in speech and of a rustic bearing Would draw suspicion towards you. What invites This whim and at this crisis? Gon. Do you ask me? I shall be plain with you, my Lord Soartes, Nor take into account your privilege Of insult. It belongs to noble birth, And using it, when the occasion offers, Is natural to your orderâserves as vent To the impatience which a life at court Engenders with its starched formalities. I deem it as unfatherly, this hit, More than unmannerly.âBut let that pass! Soartes, when you took me into favour And gave me high appointment in your household, I had no inkling of the tie betwixt us, Nor sought to disenchant the dream I had formed Of life, by casting for a lineage. My whole ambition was to hold the lead In rural sportsâto excel in archeryâ To interpret issues in a coming horse-race,â In kennel and in stable to be absolute And in the chase unrivalled. A new light And new ambitions have sprung up within me, From lurking points, undreamt of. You enquire What fascination draws me to the city? And why this resolution to be present At the grand fete in honour of the Prince? I shall be plain with you, as I have promised. Fellow conspirator! nay, start not, listen And hear me out. You may rememberâmust, How you approved of my untoward advances To your fair ward the Lady Meranie, Ay! and made promise to assist my suitâ How, when the Count Vicente pressed his claims, By your persuasion, I surrendered mine, Pledging myself, should our design succeed, To endow her and her consort lavishly. She lives in recollection with my pledge, To fulfil which I am in honour bound. Vouchers required, I claim from you the voucher That shall admit me to those palace-revels. Soar. Your purpose and the means to accomplish it I cannot fathom;ânay, be more explicit! Gon. I craved this interview, my Lord Soartes, To apprise you of the quicksand we are nearing. A chance is left us, but it rests on me, Whose interests with yours are kneaded up, To make it of avail. Deny my quest, And ere the morrow's dawn, by loud proclaim Of pursuivant, the elbow of the throne, Adviser, favourite, and what all besides, Shall be denounced the traitor and the felon. Soar. Hold, hold, you practise on me, insolent! Gon. Do I look so, with naked head a-thrust Into the lion's den? I came to warn, At peril of my life, and not to threaten. Give me the passport. My abuse of it Only myself endangers. Towards you, Were not my purpose filial, you have only To cast an eye back on my services And with them link my opportunities, To play you false, had I designed to do so. Soar. Again in leading strings! Here is the voucher! I am committed to it by your craving. The master of the ceremonies, look ye, May throw it in your face. Your speech bewrayeth And clownly garb.â (Gonseres throws of his cloak and discovers himself attired in a rich suit. Soartes starts.) Gonseres! Pardon me, I have been over-hasty in my rating. You bring to mind an old, ancestral gem Which in my cabinet at the castle hangs, A portrait by Velasquez of my grandsire, On his return from Italy. Come near, Embrace me, son! You have the blood in you Will bear commending to the royal ear.â My pleasure to adopt you shall be laid Forthwith before the king. No question, He will approve and ratify the wish Setting to letters of nobilityâ The joint sign-manual of himself and heir. To curiosity I must impute This bold resolve of yours, to play a part, As masquerader in these palace-revels. Be prudent, boy, free with the ear and eye, But cautious to a syllableâa breathâ A moving of the lips, your speech regarded. [Exit. Gon. The bait is swallowed. 'Tis a crafty fish And needs a crafty hand to take in guiding, But I have fast my purpose. At his peril, He baulks me! [Exit. End of Act IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. Scene 1. State Apartment in the Palace. Present in the back-ground, the King, Prince Amored, Count Vicente, nobles, courtiers, ladies, &amp;c. Ladies Meranie and Ella in front, the former wearing the Crown Jewel in her coronet. [Gonseres masked passes and repasses.] Ella. Dear sister! thou outshin'st thyself to-night; Well may Vicente prize thee!âThe King's gift (So he regards this marvellous diamond,) Not thee sets off, but the occasion gives For its own setting off. I can divine Wavering thoughts betwixt it and the wearer; But those who give the nobler preference Are men of tact and scholarly attainmentsâ Fine natures which are diamond mines themselves And can appraise by instinct. Mer. How you flatter! And how unlike you, Ella! 'Tis well meant, I know it; but the love is thrown away That would beseech me bravely to confront The stare of fops and rude inquisitors. To my dear husband I have sworn all honour, And at his wish, held a command by me, Parade this costly but ambiguous gem. As I have told you, sister, such parade Of strange forebodings is the stirrer up. Now, at this moment, or I am deceived, We are the special target of discourse. This knot of men and that are eyeing us, And an impertinent with swaggering stride That rips up memories of no pleasant sort, Scanning me narrowly, hath passed and re-passed. Again he makes approach, as if with purpose T'accost us, but hath taken better thought; Yet I like not his bearing nor his looks. [Gonseres passes. Ella. Dear Meranie! take courage, be yourself; My brother's mouthpiece for the nonce esteem me T'instruct you in the customs of the court. Put the bright eye that you are gifted with To usage, and your queenly presence make Proud telling of; so, you will fend and frown These idlers off. His Majesty approaches, And with him Count Vicente. (Come forward King and Count Vicente.) King. A sweet greeting, ladies! Flowers of our court, the fairest of its flowers, Whose fragrance scatters its delights around And beauty fascinates so, I would not marvel Did the romantic age of chivalry Take root again! The favour of your smiles Would tempt into the field of tournament A hundred pennons. Mer. We are proud to accept This meed of praise from our loved sovereignâ Prouder his worth and virtues to applaud And throne and realm alike congratulate Upon the new accession to their strength, In the illustrious person of the Prince. King. Your gratulations we accept with thanks, Dear ladies! The paternal heart is full. Prince Amored but occupies his part, And our Queen hers. The rest our subjects hold Filial possession of, and I, their sire, To-day, occasion take to introduce A gentle brother to their love and duty. But here he comes, will tender for himself His recognition of your high regard. (Come forward Prince and nobles.) Prince. My duty to you, ladies! Ah! I fear I am too late upon the field of favour. Our royal father hath stept in before us. King. Adjudge betwixt us, my dear Lord Vicente! This scape-grace will refuse us privilege To ope our eyes in admirationâ Our lips in eulogy of woman-kind. These gallants must have all the charms of life Made over to themselves, and look on us, As past our day, worn out and obsoleteâ Sated, choked off, and unappreciative. Is it not so, young reprobate? Prince. Nay! father! You doat too much on me to make th'impression That you are earnest in your bantering. To-day, in presence of these noble ladies, Our court in pride and pomp encircling us, You have invited me, now come of age, To share with you the labours of the throne; Thrust on me are this honour and its cares, But to accept them on their selves account, Without a counterbalance of delights, Is not in nature. King. Amored, dear son, Your bent is serious, and our mis-timed jest Provokes you to a mood that ill accords With this occasion of festivity.â How happens it, now, that we think upon't The Lord Soartes hath not kept his faith? To say the least, 'tis unaccountable, Our charge was strict. A guard of honour too Assigned, and all made ready to his hand! (Enter messenger, delivers a despatch to the King; which having glanced at, he proceeds). Ha! treasonâyet Impossible! on the grave's brink, a traitor! This fatal bauble works out prophecy And implicates the credit of our throne. So tried a servant as Soartes was Committed to so grave a confidence, To have done this! Witness, my noble lords, Here is the accusation. âLord Soartes, Custodier of the State Regalia, Hath fled the realm. The Jewel Room is vacant.â Courtier. Hoary old hypocrite! The mask has fallen At last, and to our comprehension made Clear and right manifest, this sudden turn From abject meaness and a pauper's hearth To insolence and prodigalityâ King. Hold! spare him, Messieurs! It is premature, Before the trial, to let fall the axe. As well as to the tempted, to the tempter Ascribe the blame. We did Soartes wrong, Not sounding him nor taking true account Of his embarrassments and the decline Of trust wrought in the nature of the man. To us, so far as we can bring to mind, He ever was all love and loyalty, And being our senior, and ta'en counsel of, During our madcap days, this ingrate act We are disposed to deal with leniently. What say you, Lord Vicente? But we forgetâYour Countess is his niece; This is a sore we may not tread upon, Forgive us, Lady Meranie! The charge Against your uncle, we would fain believe, By some intriguer has been bolster'd up. Prince Amored, now our right hand, must decide. His fitness to divide our cares with us Is put to early trial, we confess. Say, shall we hold in credit a despatch All so improbable, because so grave And out of keeping with the common run Of State delinquencies? Prince. To my wit's end You put me, sire. 'Tis an emergency Calls for the breaking up of these rejoicings And instant summoning of our Cabinet. [Gonseres rushes forward. Gon. Hold, hold, my liege!â Prince. Unmask thee! Who art thou That thrust'st thyself at this unwelcome time Into the royal presence? Quick, unmask, And speak thine errand with an open face. Too much of vague and needless mystery Rests on this ugly business. [Gonseres throws off his mask. King. (aside.) By heaven! It is Soartes' self grown young again, Or else this treason fastening on our mind Moulds a resemblance to him. [(aloud)âTell at once The purpose of your bold intrusion, sirrah! That you have tidings to communicate, Touching upon the matter of our trouble, We have suspicion. Speak, nor let your eye Rest rudely on the flowers of our court. Fix it on us. Your sovereign demands His rightful dues. Gonseres (kneeling.) It is to render these, Sire, I am here. My loyalty has brought me. Lay to the urgency of the occasion All breach of etiquette. King. You try our patience. Rise! We dispense with this formality; Blurt out thy say.âTruth neither halts nor stammers. Gon. No words are requisite. I make no charge. The charge is written where the eye may read it. Look roundâregard these flowers of your court, Which of them all have you so dignified Beyond its peersâso royally endowed With token of your favour?â Prince. Silence! churlâ King. Nay, Amored, keep your impatience downâ We have a sore misgiving troubling us Of some great wrong committed to our hurt, By hand of other traitor than Soartes. Gon. You do me justice, Sire! To insinuate Our King hath overlooked his loving mate, Begrudging her the privilege to wear The offsets to her crown, with the intent A wanton should supplant her,âmy life on't! I meant it not. Prince. This man's effrontery My royal father! drives beyond all bounds. To what next point, will his traducing tongue And insolent demeanor carry him? He must be looked to. Call the guardâ King. Stay, Amored! There is a fancyâmay God grant it is None other than an idle, passing fancy! Which the direction of the fellow's eye And that which it is fixed on, summon up. It grows upon us, fascinates or else Befools our gaze with its similitude. Oh! curst of all things curst, and curst the more, That here and now, and on so fair a forehead, This Jewel shewsâthis baleful diamond! By what untoward fate were we compelled? What malign devil tempted us to move In its release and re-ascendancy? Than our own selves, Soartes has less blameâ Is less conspirator 'gainst public weal.â But we distress you and your gentle Countess My Lord Vicente! (In the excitement occasioned, Lady Meranie has thrown herself into the arms of her husband.) Vicente (supporting her.) Keep heart, dear Meranie! Oh! my honoured liege! (To the King.) How shall I speak my thanks for your indulgence! A doubt against our love and loyalty, In the kind bosom of our sovereign, No wound could wound so deeply! Pardon me, That with this strong suspicion bearing on us, I arrogate the part of an adviserâ Do more, take higher ground, insist, demand That our good King shall justify his office.â The taint of Treason menaces my House, The treasure of my bosom and my honour. T'unrivet the foul charge, high heav'n will help me; But while it holds, the duty of the State And duty to myself are cast together. I ask commitment and an early trial, So justice may be done before my peers, And what strong exculpation and defence I have to offer, may engage the ear And apprehension of impartial judges. King. Dear Lord Vicente, in my inmost heart You live acquittedâ Vic. Ah! my sovereign, Your heart prejudges. I require its love, Knowing my innocence, and thank you proudly. Yet greedy honour is not satisfied, I must have full acquittal of all men, Not myself only am inculpated, But this dear sufferer. Ella, my protection Must for the moment find its substitute In your fond arms. [Transferring Ladye Meranie to the arms of Lady Ella. How fatal the mistake That held as bridal gift from royalty This inauspicious stone and urged it on thee, My countess! as a mark of kingly honour; Construing the strange medium which conveyed it, Into an artifice to stave our thanks off. Permit me to unclasp it from your brow And, through the hands of this attendant lord, Restore it to our gracious sovereign. [Disengages the diamond and places it in the hands of a lord in waiting. Mer. You remove mountains with it, dear Vicente. The suing for this trial makes me brave And eager to be partner in its issues, Knowing our innocence and thy devotion. I thank you from the loyalest of hearts My King and Prince! for this accorded grace. King. Dear lady! our suspicion of some plot Lapp'd with a plot more subtle and blood-thirsty, Ripens into conviction. But 'tis best No hasty off-hand judgment to declare Which may occasion give to idle rumours And strengthen falsehood in the accuser's hands. We therefore waive our royal privilege, And to the prudent senators of justice Forming the high Tribunal of our realm, Commit the cause. To-morrow we appoint Whereon to hold the diet. Prince. Noble sire! To retard justice reck me least inclined; But is it not essential for its ends, That of the Lord Soartes who took lead In this high crime, some tidings should be gained? Dead or alive, it rests with his production, Upon the complex bearings of the plot To throw the desired light. Ten thousand crowns We offer as award to him who brings This black offender against God and grace, Against his King, his order and his oath, Within the reach of punishment condign. King. Dear Amored! that he on whom we leant As counsellor, and loved, should so be spoken of, Makes life and the enjoyment of the throne Desolate things on which to ruminate. This treason and apostacy unman us When we take count of our old fellowship. Nevertheless, we give authority To arrest the man, with powers to wound or slay, Should he resist, and on his head set price; Ten thousand crownsâwell! be it so. If taken Alive and proven the traitor double-dyed, Which you suspect, we shall have help from Heaven To sign the warrant of his execution. Gon. I crave the King's indulgenceâ Prince. Sire, permit me;â The royal ear may not be vexed at pleasure; Nor may the insult offered to our court By mouth of this bravado be repeated. As an accuser, he has laid his charge; Of his pretensions and the whence he came, By whose connivance, he obtained admittance Into the Palaceâthese are matters which Demand strict sifting in their time and place. If I have done him wrong by the suspicions Which his fierce bearing and insulting speech,â Not least, the nature of this dark impeachment, Have stirred up in us, by my knightly oath! He shall have reparation, though I kneel to him, Meanwhile, ho! guard! look well to this man's warding: See, that he is entreated like a guest Before the reckoning comes. [Guard enters. Gonseres is led out. Let us appoint A nine days grace, my venerable sire, Rather than rush to judgment unadvised. King. You have our high approval, Amored. Ladies and noble senators, forgive me! This wildering turn of things hath brought to halt Our festival. May God go with you all! When next we meet, a more auspicious star Be in th'ascendant! and the fatal stone, So long disastrous to our ancient throne, This ordeal pass'd, may it the amulet prove Of Peace and Plenty, Loyalty and Love. [Exeunt omnes, King excepted. To this strange falling out, there more pertains Than we can grapple with. The darker plot At work for private ends, high treason turns To ridicule and a subservient thingâ A means wherewith to compass fouler crime. Of Lord Vicente and his gentle bride, Their innocence hath grown into conviction, But to establish it before the world, In face of what stern Justice may contend Is proof unanswerable,âthis is the point Tender'st to deal with. To be taken red-handed And in the act, is held to justify Summary execution, and on this Catch, the accuser hungers to make good His charge against the loyalest of our subjects; Nor is it in the province of the Crown To espouse the pannel's cause. In higher hands, We leave the upshot. [A noise of wrangling outside the Palace. There is some disturbance Holds at the postern gate. It is not wont To be so; and at this untimely hour? What can it mean? When one thing goes distraught All others followâsuch our hapless lot. [Exit King. Scene 2. Entrance to a Cave in the Forest. Midnight. A fire blazing in front. (Inoraâalone.) Inora. Before we are ourselvesâcan think or act, Our pride of beauty and of youth is over; The days are gone we hoped to turn to vantage, To win strong worship in and make ourselves Helpmates to what was worthy of apprising ? More generous is man Toward the sex's frailties than woman. To be considerate and merciful Comes of a nobler natureâlarger heart And ampler brain. Oh! wretched, raving fool! To reason so against my better knowledge. Why is this serpent coiled about my heart? Why was I coaxed into its slimy folds? What was there tempting in the tempter's voice? Life is a lieâa lie from dawn to dark'ning. A lie once spoken fathers endless lies. The devil knows it and that spark from hell Which man's tongue is the apt conductor of Widens and populates his fell dominion. Who is this Invades my solitudeâcomes to consult Me, witch reputed, at this far-gone hour? (Enter Soartes.) Thou!âin one sense least welcomeâleast expected, But to my humour, ready, ready, ready. Ay! in the nick of time, thou shew'st thyself. Soartes! 'twas but yesterday I saw thee Riding in state, companion of the King To this shift hast thou comeâdissembler! speak! Fugitive, coward, fellow-traitor, speak! What brings the serpent to the tiger's den? Soartes. Inora! my Inora! only mine! Hideâsave me from the axe! Inora. By this I save you! [Stabbing him with a poignard. Soartes dies. We are quits at last. No executioner Could do his work with such a willing heart. I'll neither pray nor ask absolvitur For the great deed of justice I have done. The need for expiation which must follow The self-same instrument shall satisfy, The King must be a witness. [Exit. Scene 3. [A postern gate communicating with the palace. [Curtain rising discovers a sentinel on duty. (Enter Inora.) Sen. Hillo! mistress, what want you? Inora. An audience with the King. Sen. Nay, back, good woman, back! Inora. I must have audience. Sen. Musts don't pass muster here. Back, back, I say. [raises his weapon. Inora. And you a soldier! Let me pass, poltroon! Thou dar'st lift hand to womanâdarest thou? Unmanly fellow! Sen. I am on duty here, old petticoat! off it, the lady's-man to any harridan. Amorous JosÃ©, they call me, my camarades at the Jollity; and I have bussed as wrinkled a wench as thyself many a time; marry! and incline to do so yet, when nothing fresher is in the wayâbut hold, good woman, back! [The postern gate opens. Enter the King. King. What means this altercation? Inora. I crave audience of the King. King. I am the King. Speak out complaint to me. What is thy grievance, woman? Inora. None, my liege! The boon I seek is of a different sort; Justice and mercy are bound up with it. A sacrifice to Justice has been done On which the eye of day is opening. 'Tis not enough. I am not satisfied. King. You have a tale to tell, or I misjudge Your bearing and the impatience of your eyes. Soldier! hold back. I have no fear of her. Speak, woman! I am father to my people. Inora. Did I not know it, heart and tongue had failed me; Yet rather than the gracious King thou art To deal with, I had tiger in King's shape Topp'd with a crown the fires of hell had forged. It were more fitting at its throne's red foot To lay my cause than to engage thine ear Too merciful! with story of great wrongs. Not suing I come here, as suers do, That have some sorry grievance to relate; Nor come I, with a mendicant's design, To probe the fountains of thy royal bounty. The favour I am set on is a greater, Because 'tis to the righting of our King It appertains, and what I crave of him Is solemn witness to the deed and purpose. King. There is some craze at work. Stay, Sentinel! [Sentinel approaches with purpose to arrest Inora. I've taken to study diosyncrasies. The woman would set right an injury Imagined to be done me. I incline To humour her. Shew me this document, That I may give it fitting attestation. Inora. An injury imagined to be done? I crazed! No, sire! the hurt is hurled at me, And from my monarch's mouth! Dear Sovereign! Recal the taunt. This is no time to jest, King. Too true! forgive me! Sentinel, stand back; I, of a verity, am so bewildered By what hath chanced within the palace gates. Outside of them, I am outside myself. The woman is in earnest. Something more In shape of evil hath befallen us. But tell the worst, abate no jot of itâ Our ear is greedy of calamityâ So used to it, that tidings the reverse Might more offend than flatter it. Inora. Bear with me, Sire! my appeal would but affront the ear, Did I direct it to that point of trust So oft abused and made the willing throat Through which descend those lies and calumnies The tongue in making resurrection of Converts to hideous and appaling shapes Whose very unreality is real, Nor priest can lay them nor the sorceror's art. I have a spectacle to shew thee, Sire! Will more convince than my unpractised tongueâ If thou put'st faith in meâbut why require it? Distrust is likelier to cap my aim Of restitution and a fit atonement; For I have wronged thee, gracious Sovereign! Unwittingly, unwisely, past forgiveness. My guilty loveâthe ardour of that love And his necessities on whose false heart It was exhausted, tempted to the crime. Baser than treason, (for high-treasons oft Run clear of baseness) whose enormity Makes muttering of danger through the realm. King. Now I have found the clue to thy request. I am in earnest to pursue its windings Thy look of desolation and despair Wins on me to put faith upon this craving, And makes it duty to look well to it No harm shall happen. Inora. It were best to be Armed against accident. May I entreat Th'assignment of a guard of soldiers, Such as occasions of solemnity Make fitting and expedient. To attest This deed and its involvings will require A host of witnesses, so I may prove To the discredit of my misplaced love My duty and restored allegiance, And for my crime make amplest reparation. King. Of the ten million hearts attached to us, Thine, in its quest, has, more than all the others, Brought into play our curiosity. Its wishes shall be humoured. Sentinel!â But nay! To quit thy post were breach of duty; Attend this woman. Of her sanity Misgivings we have none. But what her purpose? The dark surrounds it. We shall go ourselves And choose our escort in this enterprise. The Prince, mayhap, will bear us company. See to thy charge, we shall be back anon. [King exit. Sen. Thou hast got into the King's good graces, mistress; make shift, an thou art wise, not to fall out o' them. Our good monarch is of tender ear, and easily practised on, in that quarter. The sex is his failing as 'tis mine; when off duty, mind you, only? I am puzzled about thee and this persuading of him. There is something amiss lies under it; and now that the cock hath crowed and the sun is on the start, if these be not blood-spurts on thy wrist-bands, my eye is at fault. [Re-enter King, attended by Prince Amored, lords and body guard. King. We have been fortunate in chancing on you, Before the entrance to our State-apartments Thrown open for admittance to the fete Was barred on the retiring of our guests. Here is the woman we advised you of: Herself besought this escort. We are curious To sift the matter. Her comportment speaks To some strange happ'ning that concerns ourselves. What, say you?âAmored, and you, my lords? This is no hoax played on us? Prince. Sire, I share Your apprehension. If a hoax it be, There's nothing farcical mixed up with it: A tragedy hath been enacted somewhere; What means this soiling of the woman's sleeve? Inora. You shall have full and just account of it. Too soon! These bloody marks that take your gaze, Haply, the thicket and its cruel thorns Encountered in my hurry may have say In their devising; but it daunts me not The likelier surmise flashing through my brain. Such jewell'd bracelet on my sleeve to wear Before my injured Sovereign and the Prince Becomes the high occasion. King. Lead the way, Good woman! and this mystery resolve; We are impatient. Inora. Patience makes impatient, Put faith in me. The travel is not far; Three miles from hence, and by the forest track; But what that distance to tried soldiers, To me, a woman, it is but a step. [Exeunt omnes, but Sentinel. Scene closes. Scene 4. Entrance to a cave in the forest. Curtain rising discovers the body of Lord Soartes with a poignard sticking in his heart; also a huge raven perched upon the corpse in the act of picking out one of the eyes. The bird is diverted from its purpose by the sound of approaching footsteps. [Enter Inora, King, Prince, nobles, ranger, and soldiers. Raven. Croak! croak! croak. Prince. The prophet fed, in day of dole, by ravens, Excuse had to regard their utterances With ravished ear. On ours, these dismal notes Grate harshly and the revelation bode Of horrors close at hand. The evil bird Whose marvellous instinct leads from haunt remote In mountain gorge or facings of the sea, To scenes of blood and rapine, has taken flight. List to the ghostly flapping of its wings! But to our pilot through this under-wood And mazings of the forest, we are bound To give implicitly our confidence, Here is our point of halt, or I mistake Her gestures? Inora. King, Prince, and Nobles! witnesses be you To my confession and this spectacle! There lies the Lord Soartes slain by meâ Slain by the hand that would have helped him back To fortune's favour and to men's esteem. My love for him and constancy concealed His execrable points and gilded o'er His vices so, I grew enamour'd of themâ Hugged them as virtuesâshaped a paragon Out of their grossness, made him my heart's idol. Oh, Gracious King! from such misguided faith, Crop up whole harvests of calamity; Treasons and wrongs, the accidents of war,â A hundred growths entailing bitter fruits Come of this cause and simple origin. The wrong done thee, from no more lofty source Drew its gigantic and abhorrent shape; See there! a measure of the Expiation! [points to the body of Soartes. King. To have been prompter to this treachery Thou hast confessed thyself. Thy plea advanced Before Heaven's high tribunal may avail, Where angels are enrolled as witnesses, And every sore tentation to the crime Is taken account of. Its acceptance, here, Our straighten'd apprehensions bar the way to. On such lame score to justify thyself, In face of stubborn and resistless facts, Before the most indulgent of our judges, Hold it impossible! Thy doom is sure, Taking this crime alone into account But doubly sure, when murder mates with Treason. Inora. Thy sentence, King, all trial interdicts. King. Nay, woman! Justice in our ancient realm Shall have its method and solemnities. Trial awaits thee in its usual form; And now thou know'st the doom o'erhanging thee, And hast considered of itâart thyself Against thyself the accuser and the witnessâ If thou hold'st hopes of mercy from thy God (For not a remnant of forgiving grace Is left thee here), make clear thy conscience Answer me straightly, woman, on these hopes. Much rests upon the droppings from thy tongue Of high importance to ourselves and lieges, And to yourself of consequence. Reflect. Among our usages the Rack and Question Are still in vogue! Therefore, we urge it on you, Be plain in your replies, direct and truthful, Prevaricating none, concealing nothing. Inora. My being self-accuser and informerâ A traitress to the treason I had plann'dâ A murderess who glories in her crime; No marvel, Sire, such aggregate of guilt Bearing with violence on thy tender heart Should so convulse and overset its nature. Mistake me not, my honoured sovereign! These menaces of torture from your lips Move but to higher holdings of respect. I ask no graceâno mercy at your hands No commutation or delay of sentence. Of pardon and release from punishment In its most cruel and revolting shape, I cherish not one solitary hope. But put thy questioning to me. I am here To expiate my self-acknowledged crimes, Willing, too willing! Into strong desire And purpose to unbosom all I know Of this conspiracy, my willingness Hath mounted and awaits your royal pleasure. King. What we would know of thee (Prince Amored These nobles and our guard of soldiers Attesting to thy shrift) concerns ourselves Less than the loyal bearing of a subject. Thy thoughts are with Soartes. Put aside The hoary traitor. 'Tis not carrion Like that we would refer to, but a man Of highest value in all men's esteem; And mated with him is a noble lady Whom Rumour saith, her uncle, thine accomplice And victim, brought to verge of poverty. Answer me plainly of the Lord Vicente, And of his Countess, Lady Meranieâ What part they played in this conspiracy? Inora. An accusation lying at the doors Of this sweet lady and her noble husband So foul, so devilish! King! believe it not. None but that caitiff whom my hands have slain, And whom the dark experience of a life-time, Taught me too late, was schooled in villany Up to his passing graduate in its arts,â Adept the more that he was plausible, None but this miscreant could have mouthed or penned Such an aspersion! King. Note the womans' wordsâ The verity which, in this hour of trial, Dwells in her faceâthe angel overcoming, Not without struggle, its opposing devil! Our fond anticipations are encouraged But we have question more to put to thee; Nor will the doubt which intercepts our faith Rest satisfied until thou answer'st truly. Confederates in the seizure of our jewels Ye must have hadâthou and thy paramour; We know you as the back-ground of the plot, For upon that score, you are self-confessed; But that anotherâothers shall we say? Took forward and especial part in it, It needs no stretch of ingenuity To go beyond suspicion of. Now, that we've studied and avized thee closely, A face crops us, so much resembling thine And that dead traitor's blended into thine, It could be sworn to, as the consequence Of your illicit loves. The when and where That face confronted us, how strange it is That only at this instant we recal them! And yet three hours at most have not elapsed Since the disturbance at our palace revels. Say, Amored, are we deceived and does This woman's visage practise on our senses? Prince. Nay, royal father! thou hast hit the truth, And cleared off hesitation from my mind. The self-same fancy has been troubling it, All through the mazes of this strange confession, To safe conclusion we arrive together. The insolent, who at our festival Obtruded with impeachment on his lips And foul aspersions, was this woman's son, Confederate and chief actor in the plot. 'Tis fortunate we hold him in arrest, But see to her! Her eye is fixed on us! Inora. A calumny! Unsay it. Prince, unsay it! High aspirations were his mother's curse And a misplaced affection. What befel her, Your eyes and ears bear woful witness to; But all the climbings of my heart and soul Were grovellings in the mire compared to his. That he had high hand in that business Regarding the regalia I confess to, But that he moved in't for ulterior purpose, Oh, God! the thought makes doubly desolate! Of all abandoned women, I the most! Even in this hour of expiation, I held Gonseres the appointed means Whereby to vindicate my outraged honourâ O, soaring offspring of a soaring mother! Vulture from vulture bred! is this the close, Of all our grasping ventures? [Rushes to the body of Soartes and detaches the poignard. King. Take in charge That woman, guards! Inora. Keep off one moment, dogs! 'Twill save the costs of trial and the headsman. Heart's blood to heart's blood let them so commingle. [stabs herself. That whether heav'n or hell be our award, No matter! there is marriage now betwixt us. [dies. Prince. A woman valorous and resolute, More sinned against than sinning! King. Soldiers! Your swords and axes hurry into play, Make tressels of these timbers. Here, at hand, Are prunings of an oak, the hurricane Or fiery thunderbolt hath been at work on. Shape them to hand-spokes of convenient length, On which to rest these bodies. Yonder stands A cypress whose funereal plumes wrenched off Will form a ready and appropriate pall; Heap them on thickly, so no passer by May of your ghastly burden catch a glimpse. Our noble Ranger here will take the lead. To the State Prison bear them, with instructions To hold them closely under lock and key. [Soldiers and Ranger retire to cut hand-spokes. Now that we hold our evidence complete, There is no motive to delay this trial. What say you Amored? and you my lords? A shift of diet is expedient. These corpora delicti will be needed As witnesses. More emphasis of speech Dwells in their mute and haggard visagesâ More verity upon their tacit lipsâ More searching lightnings in their fixed gaze Than in a hundred vacillating tongues And twice than number of unmeaning eyes. We therefore to insure their evidence, Recal the putting off of this enquiry, And name to-morrow, as the day of trial. You will arrange it so, good Chancellor! Here come our soldiers laden with their hand-biers And screeny umbrage. [Re-enter Ranger and soldiers bearing their wood-spoils. Take these corpses up And lay them separately upon their staves;â Muffle them well with cypress. [The bodies are arranged on the hand-spokes and covered over with boughs. Four soldiers take their places on each side. Lift and march! [Ranger and soldiers exeunt with the bodies. The air is stifling, We feel as if an earthquake were at hand. Your arm, dear Amored! let us leave this spotâ Tradition will re-people it with spectres And round it cast a halo of great horrors. This day's experiences forebode to-morrow's! Our throne's a seat of thorns and canopied with sorrows, The trial that impends is trial sore To those he loves, but to their sovereign more; God give him courage to do well his part And fortify alike both head and heart! [Exeunt omnes. Scene 5. Hall of Justiceâ The Bench occupied by three Judges. Count Vicente and Lady Meranie on trial. Procureur-general, avocats, soldiers, macers, &amp;c. The trial supposed to have been proceeded with up to a certain stage. 1st Judge. Touching the arraignment, procureur, We are at fault. The wording of it bears That with the appearing pannels Lord Vicente And Lady Meranie, one named Gonseres Should stand consorted? Pro. The Crown hath waived, In the meantime, its charge against this man; As an approver, not as one accused We are instructed to regard him. 1st Judge. Good! This is our King's desire. We so accept it; And in this bearing, we shall question him. That he is in commitment and at hand We take for granted. Bring him into court. [Gonseres is led into court by soldiers. Hold up your hand and after me repeat The oath we dictate. âBy th'Almighty God! Who knoweth all things and the hearts of men, I swear to speak the truthâthe truth entire, As I shall answer at His Judgment Seat.â [Oath administered, repeated by Gonseres. (Judge proceeds.) Your designation on th'roll before us Is incompleteâsimply amounts to thisâ You held engagement with the Lord Soartes. In what capacity is vaguely stated. Rumour asserts you were his protÃ©gÃ© Advanced for some small service you had done him To post of confidence! Further than this, (But we are slow to credit what is thrust Upon the common ear), that there is tie of blood Betwixt you; anywise, you hold His special favour. On the point of kinship, You are at freedom to enlighten us, Or leave us in the dark. We need not say, The more of cloud you help to dissipate Surrounding you and your pretensions, The clearer you let in the light upon us Whereby to estimate you tell the truth. The name assumed by you, among his vassals, Holds not. It is consorted, or we err, With titles claimed by him of old descent. Gon. I am Soartes' son. Judge. In wedlock born? Gon. I have no reason to say otherwise. Yet how should I know? or what matters it? It is no fault of mine. His noblest souls With bastard bodies God incorporates Oftener, than with legitimacy blends, To make a farce of which and a contemptâ Judge. Silence! you run before the wind too quicklyâ Are libertine in speech, and would defame Your mother, sire, and self, man's law and God's, All in one breathing. Such respect of things We warn you, argues disrespect of Truth, And to the scales of judgment bringeth weight. We beat the bush round, coming to the point; Now, straight to it, without a tack or halt Our purpose bear us! Lay thine accusation Against this noble lady and her consort. Gon. I am coerced to make appearance here. In what capacity? Approver? Witness? Why settle all the burden upon me? The King, the Prince, and their surrounding court Were equally approvers to the fact. Her crime stood blazing on that woman's brow. All saw it that had eyes. Did I accuse her! It needed not. The evidence hung there, Clear as a star bound on the brow of night When nature and the high heavens are serenest. 2nd Judge. That it behoved her and took fitting part On this occasion of imperial joy, Nor drew especial notice from the King, Until provoked by your audacious presence, Creates suspicion you were at the root Of a conspiracy against this ladyeâ Before we further task you on the matter, A simple statement from the Count Vicente Claims our regard: [Enter a herald. Herald. The King and Prince approach! [Enter King, Prince, and nobles. King. To the court assembled And our puissant judges heading it We offer kindly greeting. Let our presence Act not in interruption of proceedings. The point this vexing trial hath attained to A glance takes in, and to re-iterate Is not required. An opportunity Is given to the noble Lord Vicente To vindicate his loyalty and honour, So we have been apprized. With wistful ear We would attend him and a hopeful heart. Vic. Dear Sovereign! the whole of my defence Rests on a simple narrativeâso simple And yet (proceeding from the mouth of one, Trusted as an adviser to the State Whose over-weening judgment should have led To more correct conclusions) so unlike A thing of likelyhood, as to make clear To some, there is contrivance at the root. Not so to you my gracious Sovereign! Yet, did this fanlt of judgment compromise None but myself, I would kneel down to it And ask disgrace and exile for my weakness, Great happiness, the knowledge of my favour In the King's eyes, my prizing beyond price The pride and flawless jewel of my heart All had to do with it. Such extasy, Delirium call it, will occasion take In every man's experience to o'er-ride At happ'ning times, the clearest of his senses. My narrative is shortly told. A week After our joyful nuptials, while as yet The crescent of our honeymoon of love Was on the ascendant, I had occasion To pass into my study about sunrise, And in so doing, all at once my eye Lighted upon an arrow fast ennailed In the oak pannel opposite a casement Which over-looks the lawn before our castle. Attached by silken ribbon to its point Was a small casket freighted with this stone Of evil destiny; and on the shaft Fluttered a label scrawled by feigning pen Whose purport was the pressing for acceptance As bridal gift, on Lady Meranie, The jewel now in question. To put construction on so strange a happeningâ To interpret it in any other light, Taking into account the diamond's worth, Than as a royal token of regard, All notion of conspiracy at work Unentertained, were treason in itself. Yet, Sovereign! a diviner power, believe me, To deal with strong temptations and work out Problems in human motives, is bestowed Upon our loving helpmates than ourselves,â A higher intuition, greater tact. Had I but hearken'd to my better angel And the dissuasion of her fragrant lips. Not urging on her my insane conceits, Oh! what humiliation had been saved us! King. A strange relation this, my Lord Vicente, But with its very strangeness, if we err not, The proofs of its veracity are bound. Where are this shaft and its appurtenances? We are desirous to examine them. Pro.-Gen. They lie before the Court, your Majesty, Placed in production for the Count's defence. Judge. Macer! remove and lay before the King These depositions of the Lady Ella And the retainers of the Lord Vicente Taken and sworn to in judicial presence; Also this arrow and its rude direction. The evidence is irrefragable, [Documents and arrow laid by Macer before the King. And with the declaration of the accused Tallies in every point and circumstance. With your high sanction, honoured Sovereign! Of the grave crime imputed to the arraigned, This esteemed lady and her noble consort, We would pronounce acquittal and discharge. King. Most noble Judges! 'tis with gratitude We give approval to your grave decision. This clearing from all doubt of loyalty, On part of Lord Vicente and his lady, Removes a heavy burden from our heart. Now that they stand assoilzed, we are hopeful The evil influence of this diamond Hath passed away and with it every cloud Boding disaster and calamity. But here remaineth over for disposal This false accuser. To be merciful, Upon occasions which the outward eye Regards, as counselling opportunity To deal out justice with unsparing hand, And vindicate the Majesty of Law, Is our rejoicing. A man's lost repute,â His life, the future of his race and kin,â All the sore forfeitures incurred by him And provocations leading to his crime Require to be considered, weighed, and rated. But in the instance of this libertine And foul asperser of a lady's honour, No loop-hole of escape can we espy, Nor an excuse for exercise of mercy. Among the documents submitted to us In form of depositions, meets our glance One carrying relation to this arrow, Our Forest ranger recognizes it, As fashioned by the approver, who, it seems, Is skilled as an artificer of weapons Made use of in the chase, and traded with Largely on that account. More evidence We hold in hand, which bears upon the fact That he was party in the jewels' abstraction; But in the darker and more devilish scheme, Sole actor and contriver. Fellow! speak [to Gonseres. And make confession ample of thy crime! The little that is left us of our patience Take vantage of to better any one Thou hast regard for and reduce the shame And infamy accruing to thy name. Gon. To have prejudged and doomed me, let suffice; What need of more? To coax confession from me Or with the rack extort it, I defy thee! That in the seizure of the regal jewels I was accomplice of the Lord Soartes You have adduced no proof; and your conclusions Come of the simple fact he was my sire. As hostage to detain me for his crime Your laws give no direct authority. For his escape, be thanked his better stars! I hav'nt such divinities to thank In my behalf, and when the King resolves Against me with his batch of hired judges My dutyâthe extremest of my duties, Which hath no will of soul or body in it, Is to submit. King. One spark of grace in thee Might, but we wrongly deemed, have led to make Some small atonement for thy heinous crimes. Dastard and perjured! hast thou no relenting? We make one moreâthe last appeal to thee And if it move thee not, thy soul be pitied! [To the heraldsâ Hie, heralds! to the Prison of the State And summon forth the Warder and his charge. A fitting retinue there is provided. Conduct all here with due solemnity. Judge. Throw ope the gates and let a space be cleared In front of the approver. Macers! ho! Advance and range yourselves, with staves of office Lowered, on each side the entrance. [A flourish of trumpets is heard, succeeded by solemn music; the dead-march and misereres. A train headed by the heralds, warder, and six monks chanting a requiem, enters. Following these, are carried, each by eight soldiers, the bodies of Lord Soartes and Inora, covered over with cypress boughs; an officer in rear with sword depressed. Two tressels are brought forward and placed in front of Gonseres, the King and nobles occupying a throne and benches opposite. King. (to Gonseres) Prepare thy hardened heart and insolent eye, If in the former ever nature dwelt And from the latter ever sprung a tear, To combat with a spectacle of horror So terrible, the angels, Death's excepted, Encircling us for better or for worse, Shudder and hide their faces in their wings. Soldiers! Remove these leafy coveringsâ (aside.) Bear up, my heart! Sustain me, heart and brain! I have a monarch's duty to perform. [The soldiers remove the cypress branches and expose the bodies of Soartes and Inora. Gon. Is this the cruel end of it? Oh, mother! The high conclusions of thy scheming brain Are come to with a vengeance. Listen, King! I owe thee a confession, and thou owest The grace to me, and so do all assembled, To hearken to it. The one tender part Surviving in my nature thou hast touched, And by this touch set free the hidden springs Which I had thought to choke and fasten up. Oh, Monarch! be indulgent to my woe! No utterance of it struggling through my lips Can give thee apprehension of its depths Nor of the whirlpool with its eddying clutch That downward drags meâdownward to perdition! Could I wring words from these cold effigies, It might abate my torture, and my crimes Shew in another light. Oh, mother! speak, And answer why the issue of thy womb Thou did'st not stifle at its bringing forth? Better thou had'st done so, than let the sun Take cognizance of what hath come to pass From such irresolution and forbearing. King! it was but as yesterday gone by, I came to know my worthy parentage; And with the revelation of this tie, In our design upon the royal jewels, Rests my complicity. The Lord Soartes, Until this light was let in on my mind, I knew but as my patron and protector, Her as a moon-struck woman, witch regarded, That shunned all converse with humanity. Our grasping project was devised by her, As but a means to re-instate the man On whom she had bestowed her all alreadyâ The jewels of her heart and precious crown Never to be restored, of chastity! This revelation of the tie betwixt us Was made occasion of to urge on me Acceptance as a partner in her scheme; In which capacity I pledged myself To recommend it to the Crown custodier, As an expedient opportune and simple Whereby to mend his fortunes and repair The wrongs done to the lady Meranie. That I lent greedy ear to her proposal, As suiting my ambition, I deny not. To Lord Soartes, as I knew him then, I also had some measure of attachment. Another bond there was; of it, anon. In brief, my mother's humour I gave in to And plied my patron so with arguments, No shadow of resistance there remained. King. Go on with your confession. Once we looked For better endings from our ancient gossip; But brittle staffs are those which Kings lean on. What we require to know and be assured of Is, not so much the part enacted by you In this conspiracy, as to have set Before us and made clear the mystery Pertaining to the ranker of your crimes; For so we hold the attempt to implicate A noble and most estimable lady In the award of treason. Gon. Sovereign! Upon so grave and solemn an occasion, In presence of these authors of my being Whom violence hath slain (nor do I seek The manner of their fates to have set forth, For on my inner vision bursts to light The closing chapter of this tragic tale, And I can read it, in its every page Sentence and letter to the dire conclusion) In presence of these silent witnesses, Upon whose faces vacated by life The cruel hand of Death bedaubed with gore Hath token setâbefore this Court assembledâ Before the King and his surrounding nobles; They too regarding me whom in fierce hate And frantic jealousy I would have made Sacrifice of, without remorse or quailing,â In presences so telling and august Moved by some pow'r sent down from heaven to move me, I have declared to make a full confession. What prompted me to embrace my mother's scheme Was, as already told, a strong desire To help, in his extremity of fortune The Lord Soartes; not for his own sake, Nor yet in gratitude for favours dealt me. These were at best but secondary motives. The baron had a niece, his ward as well, In whose bright eyes I though to 'stablish favour, And under this delusion, made advances In my own boisterous fashion, which, repelled, I sought her guardian's ear; and flattering it With promise of my zealous services. In his behoof, (the advantage of our project Also set forth in eulogistic terms,) So won upon him that he undertook To enforce his ward's submission to my claims. At this auspicious juncture, there stepped in Another, in whose stepping in I read As 'twere the death warrant to my soaring hopes, The Count Vicente, an accepted suitor, Who had been absent upon state affairs, Up to this date, pressed forward on the stage And carried all before him. Lord Soartes Her wronger and betrayer fain would back Out of our compact; but I held the reins, And when to slacken or to tighten them, Knew well. His helping to my high ambition Was now beyond all possibility; Yet to cry quits and let our project die A natural death, it was not in my nature. The jealousies within my bosom roused Had no compunction. My revenge was settled, And out of hell I summoned witnesses To put their mark to it. Never occurred Such opportunity to work a vengeance; And strung to the considerate working of it Were every nerve and thew of energy. Of this dark episode, you know the ending. King. A terrible confession thou hast made And tingling to our ears. The which to hold thee, Demon or maniac, or the twain combined, We are in doubt. This only shall we say, That the surrendering to thy better angel And making revelation of thy guilt And promptings to it, put more hopeful face On the hereafter thou art entering on. Forbid, that the insane presumption Of mercy from our mouth should cling to thee! The executioner is at the gate, The rearing of the scaffold within earshot. Our kingdom is too narrow to admit Truculent men and graceless, such as thou, To prosper in it. The purgation Of yesterday insists upon completion; And may such fates and unexampled deaths The bitter fruits of unexampled crimes Give warning to all men to put restraint Upon their wollish passions and desires. If thou hast aught to tag to thy confession, Out with it quickly! Gon. King! there but remains One grace to askâone duty to perform, Now, that my shrift is ended. From this lady, Whom I have so maligned and sought to harm, With foulest machinations compassing Her honour and her life, I sue forgiveness! And the same earnest grace, by word or sign, To have accorded to me, I entreat Her noble husband. So, my sovereign, I shall have peace in parting with this world And better passport to the one beyond. Vic. Far be it from me to refuse to thee So small a boon, if it will give thee peace And make thy penitence of aught avail. With sanction of the Church, our loving Countess Appoints, that masses for her uncle's soul And thine be offered for a twelvemonth's space, The King consenting. King. Generosity (to Gonseres) Flowing so largely from so wronged a source Hath rarely had its like. With coals of fire Heaped on thy head and at thine own beseeching, To meet thy righteous doom it is ordained. This Christian example we are moved by And shall remit in part, the penalties Our laws assign to Treason. Thy beheadal Will satisfy the stern demands of Justice. In the same condemnation we include The mute insensate form that was Soartes; For such disfigurement is justly due To every wretched felon, dead or living, Who tampering basely with his post of trust, As did this treacherous and degraded man, Works to the hurt of Order and of Peace. The quartering of his body we dispense with, Calling to mind our former fellowship. And now Prince Amored, our beloved son! Judges and peers assembled! ere we part, One duty yet remains to be performed Which as the wind-up on this sore occasion, Takes worse with us than dealing to the others Their due award. Of all catastrophes Most woful in our life's experience, As woful as the carnage of defeat, Was this weird woman's end. 'Twas martyrdom More than self-murder, and the deed of blood Preceding it, a brave, heroic act! Too late, she came to knowledge of her shame, And of the vile and heartless paramour To whom, upon the altar of his lust, Were sacrificed her reason and her virtue. Nevertheless, Holding in view each terrible temptation, (An erring love the strongest reck'd of all), It is our duty to refuse to this Void shell, its rest in consecrated ground; And to appoint that it be carried out Beyond the precincts of the city walls Into the Forest's heart; and at a spot Where three paths meet, be solemnly interred. The stake which law and usage do adjudge To be thrust through the hapless suicide, That poignard in its place shall represent. [Pointing to the dagger sticking in Inora's heart. Soldiers! restore these leafy coverings And bear her forth to her appointed home. Let toll the prison bell! A funeral march With muffled drums, strike up! Bearers! advance And lift this quondam image of a man Transmuted to a fiend! The more we think on't, More monstrous grows the thought, he was our gossip, And held the royal ear in command. To execution prompt, lead out Gonseres; The self-same axe that lops that traitor's head off, Unwiped, will satisfy its other purpose. [The bodies of Inora and Soartes are carried out, and Gonseres, under guard, led forth to execution; solemn music, and the tolling of a bell, accompanying the march of the procession. Observe, my lords, how work the avenging Fates! The murderous dagger and the headsman's weapon, In the commingling of these savage bloods, Are brought to bear and silently are loud In their proclaim of an o'erruling Power. And now, dear friends! be notched upon your minds The bringings forth of this eventful day, And in red letters on your calendar, Let it be scored, whether for feast or fast, For gratulation and high thanksgiving, Or as a day of humbling and confession; Both purposes it will subserve and answer. Nor shall the diamond that hath led to this Disturbance in our fair dominions Be reconsigned to darkness and neglect. The new custodier of our Regalia We now establish in his post of honour, In person of the noble Count Vicente; In the full faith, he will discharge his trust With unimpeachable fidelity. We also do appoint that once in the year Solemn procession from our palace gates To the Cathedral, shall be set on foot; In front of it the Cross, and following A silver salver with the Jewel graced And rubied round with all our choicest peers; Also this guard of honour shall include The fairest virgins in our broad dominions Plumed and attired in robes of modesty. [Curtain falls. (Drama concluded.)</field>
