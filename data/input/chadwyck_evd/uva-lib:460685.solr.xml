      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âA Street in Romeâsix Citizens discovered. Enter Marcus and Titus, looking occasionally back, as if observing something passing behind them. Mar. Who is that next him in mourning? Tit. His nephew; the rest are common friends. Poor Vettius! no one will plead for him. Mar. Peace! they are coming on. Enter Vettius and his four Friends, in mourning, followed by Probus and twelve other Citizens. Vet. Weep not, my friends, for me; for Romeâfor Rome Reserve your tears. Her pride is turn'd to shame; Her wealth to poverty; her strength to weakness; Her fair report into a blasted name; Her freedom into thraldom. Who would thrive In Rome, let him forget what honour is, Truth, reverence for the gods, respect for man! Ay, gaze, ye poor, despised sons of Rome! That crouch to your own power, by men more strong, Only because more daring, wrenched from you! Ay, gaze; and see your lovers, one by one, Cut off; and never curse, unless it be Your own hands, that you dare not stretch to save them! [Vettius and his Friends go out. Tit. Masters, we are in a sorrowful plight indeed, when such a friend as Vettius spurns us. Mar. See! who is that he stops to speak to? Tit. Know you not? Why, you've seen him as often as you've seen your own hand. 'Tis the senator Fanniusâthat Fannius, that looks so sweetly on the people, and, for all that, never yet did them a good turn. Mar. Oh! is it he? Tit. To be sure it is! See how he leans to Vettius, and seems to pity him. I warrant you there's a tear in his eye now, although his heart would laugh to tell you how it came there. See, he puts his hand upon his breast; that's an appeal to his honesty, which is always sure to be out of the way, whenever any one else happens to call upon it. Oh, he's a proper patrician! Mar. Think you they will condemn Vettius? Tit. Think you he is a friend to the people? Mar. Who doubts that he is? Tit. Who doubts, then, they will condemn him? Mar. See! Fannius quits him. Tit. And he's as much his friend as ever he was. His absence will profit him just as much as his presence.âYonder comes Licinius, the brother-in-law of Caius Gracchus. Who knows but Caius will speak for Vettius, who was his brother Tiberius's friend? Mar. Not he! He never appears in the assemblies of the people. Pro. No; he loves to keep house better. He is married, you know; and his wife is a fair woman. No wonder he prefers her company to ours. Mar. Do they say he is a man of any parts? Tit. Yes; he assisted his brother Tiberius once, when he was tribune; and he was thought to be of great promise. 'Tis said he is much given to study. Mar. 'Twould seem so, indeed; and that he had not yet found out it was the patricians who murdered his brother. I would have taken more revenge for a cur of mine that had been lamed, than Caius took for his brother that was murdered. What revenge did he take? None! He kept house, while the patricians buried his brother in the Tiber! Rome has nothing to hope from him. Pro. Nay, that's certain. He'll never die for the people. Mar. Die! No, nor live neither. Tit. Silence! Licinius is here. Enter Licinius and Caius Gracchus. Lic. Health to you, master! Mar. Health to Licinius! Caius. [To Licinius.] The people look coldly on me. Lic. Hang them! They show fine airs at their own handiwork. I'll speak to them. Caius. Gently, I pray you; they are bare and hungry, houseless and friendless, and my heart bleeds for them. Lic. What is the cause of your collecting? Lit. We come to see Vettius condemned. Lic. Why do you say condemned? The laws are to try him. He will have justice. Mar. Ay, from the patricians! Lic. What of the patricians? Are not the patricians just? Mar. Not to the people. Lic. Why not? Mar. Because they have the power to be otherwise. They have as great dominion over the people, as over their oxen; and so they treat them like their oxen,âunhide them, hack them up, and feed upon them. Lic. Are the people, then, no better than their oxen, that they endure all this? Mar. What can the people do? They have no friends that will speak or act for them. The people can do nothing of themselvesâthey have no power. If the people could find friendsâ Lic. Peace! peace! If you gain friends, you lose them straight. Whoe'er would die for you, you let him die! You shrug, you shiver, and you whine; but he That pities you, has need, himself, of pity. You make a big shout, and a frightful face; But in your deeds are little to be feared. Mar. Are you against us, too? You that were Tiberius's friend? Lic. Who but his friend should be against you? You That fell from him in danger, who to you In danger clung? Who would not be against you? Drowning, you make a cry; and when a hand Is found to keep your head above the flood, And bear you safe to land, at the first wave That booms upon youâidiots in your fear! You mar his skill, and sink him to the bottom! Mar. Is that our way? Lic. Ask you for friends, who to your friends are foes? In presence, too, of Caius Gracchus, here, Whose brother you gave up to death? Mar. We gave! Lic. Ye gave! When, in the exercise of your rights, The nobles, with their herd of slaves and clients, Drove youâa base herd to be so driven!â With clubs and levers from the market-place, What did you then? Like spectres, with your fear, Livid and purged of substance, you glared on, And saw Tiberius, mangled with their staves, Into the Tiber thrown, as butchers cast The offal to the tide. Caius. No more, Licinius; Pray you, no more; you are too stern with them. Lic. Too stern! Would the patricians learn of me, I'd teach them how to cater for the people. They should not have a vote. If free-born men Will crouch like slaves, why would you have them freemen? Caius. It is his mood, friends; let him be; ne'er mind him. [Licinius and Caius Gracchus go out. Mar. 'Tis plain Licinius is no friend of ours. Tit. He says the truth. You suffered the patricians and their slaves to murder Tiberius. Mar. If Licinius is so bitter against us, what must we expect from Caius? Tit. Yet would he have stopped Licinius when he railed at us. Who knows but Caius would befriend the people if he could? Mar. Not he! He'd hang the people if he could.âCome, masters; to the Forum. Farewell, Tiberius! He would not see Vettius accused without defending him.â'Twill be long before we shall see such another friend as Tiberius! [They go out. SCENE II. âThe Forumâthe Tribunal, on which is the Curule Chair, six Lictors on each sideâan Altarâa Rostrum. Flaminius, Opimius, Tuditanus, Fannius, and Senators discovered. Opi. How would you cure a state o'errun with evils, But as you'd cleanse a garden rank with weeds? Up with them by the roots! The slothful hand That will not bend it to the needful work, Mars its own ease, and profitless expends The labour which it grudges. Why falls Tiberius, If not his coadjutor? Vettius free, Gracchus should have been free, and Rome a slave. Fla. Know you what friend he trusts with his defence? Tud. 'Tis rumour'd, but I say not with what truth, That, hopeless of acquittal, he will plead Guilty, and throw himself upon our mercy. Opi. Our mercy, then, is mercy to ourselves; In showing which, we dare not pardon him. Caius, I trust, will not appear for him. Fan. Not he; he shuns all care of public questions, And seems to be a mild retiring man. He is not of the temper of Tiberius; Or, if he is, he does not emulate His fate. Opi. I would not have him speak for Vettius: His voice would be omnipotent against us. Fan. See, Vettius is at hand! Opimius, You will conduct the prosecution. [Flaminius ascends the tribunalâthe Patricians follow, and remain at the foot of the stepsâOpimius goes and ascends the rostrum. Enter Vettius with his Friends, followed by Titus, Marcus, and Citizens. Opi. Vettius, stand forth! Vet. [Advancing.] Behold, Opimius, The sacrifice is ready! Opi. The false man Is his own sacrificer. Gentle Romans, When shall we live as brothers? Is not Rome Our common mother? Why should we, her sons, Be foes? Ye powers that favour civil concord, Prepare your vengeance, for the fratricide Foments distrust among us. Tit. Opimius pays the people court. Mar. Yes, he rides us well. He strokes us when we do not need the spur. Oh, we are gentle beasts! Opi. You, Spurius Vettius, I accuse of treason. What answer you? Vet. That, since the times decree To innocence, what was in ancient days The penalty of guilt, I am prepared To suffer your award, and answerâguilty! [Goes under the rostrum. Fla. And waive you all defence? Vet. When knew you, consul, A man, already cast, to make defence? I seem at large, but well am I advised My cause is tried, and final sentence pass'd. If you would have me use a Roman's right, Show me the Romans I shall claim it of. Call you these Romans? Why, your very slaves Put on a prouder port, and cower not thus Before you! Opi. Hear you his seditious speech? But he convicts himself. Say, Romans, say, What penalty do you adjudge the traitor? Tud. Let it be death. Tit. Nay, good Tuditanus, name some other punishment. We will consent to banish him. Opi. It is too mild a sentence. Let it be death! Senators. Ay, death! Fla. Come down, Opimius, help us to collect The votes. [Opimius descends from the rostrum, and goes down behind the Citizens. Vet. O, Romans! he that is content To live among you, prostrate as you are, Should suffer worse than death! Opi. Your votes! Caius Gracchus appears in the rostrum. Caius. Opimius, hold! [Upon hearing Caius Gracchus the people shout, press round the rostrum, and cry, âCaius! Caius Gracchus! Caius! Caius!â] Opi. How! Gracchus in the rostrum! Caius. Hold, good Opimius, do not yet collect The votes. Tit. &amp; Citizens. No! no!âNo votes! Mar. Speak, Caius Gracchus! speak! Caius. I come to plead for Vettius. Tit. Go on! go on! Caius. The brother of Tiberius for the friend! Mar. Noble Caius, go on! Caius. I pray you, gentle friends, if I should make you A poor, confused, disjointed, graceless speech, Let it not hurt the man for whom I plead. If I should falterâif my heart should rise Into my throat, and choke my utterance, Or if my eyes should with a torrent drown My struggling words, let it not, I beseech you, Let it not hurt the man for whom I plead! Mar. Tiberius lives again! Tiberius speaks! Caius. Tiberius lives again! Alas, my friends! Go ask the Tiber if he lives again; Cry for him to its waters; they do know Where your Tiberius lies, never to live Again. Their channel was his only grave, Where, still, they murmur o'er him; but, with all The restless chafing of their many waves, Cannot awake one throb in the big heart That wont to beat so strong, when struggling for Your liberties! Tit. Noble Tiberius! Mar. Noble Caius! See how he weeps for his brother! Opi. Their hearts are his already. Our labour 's lost. Caius. What is't you do? Is it to banishment Or death, you are about to doom that man? Know you no heavier punishment for those That love you? Rather let them live, to hear You groan beneath the burdens of the great, And bear it!âTo behold you vilely spurn'd By clients, bondsmen, hirelings, and bear it! To see you griped by heartless usury! To hear your children cry to you for food, Without a shelter for your wretched heads, Or land enough to serve you for a grave, And bear it! To a Roman, such as Vettius, What banishment, what death, were suffering Equal to life like this? Tit. Most true! most true! Mar. Vettius is a friend to the people, and therefore he is accused. First Citizen. Ay, that's his crime. Second Citizen. He's innocent. Tit. &amp; Mar. Vettius is innocent! Opi. Have you done, Caius? For, by your leave, I will produce my witnesses. Vet. They are the creatures of thy tampering; Wretches that feed upon the victims of Thy cruelty. Opi. Hoa, there! My witnesses! Mar. No witnesses! no witnesses! Tit. Speak, Gracchus, speak! We'll hear you, Gracchus, before a thousand witnesses.âGo on! Citizens. Go on! go on! Caius. Romans! I hold a copy of the charge, And depositions of the witnesses. Upon three several grounds he is arraign'd: First, that he strove to bring the magistracy Into contempt; next, that he form'd a plot, With certain slaves, to raise a tumult; last,â And were there here the slightest proof, myself Would bid him sheathe a dagger in his breast,â That he conspired with enemies of Romeâ With foreigners, barbariansâto betray her! The first, I'll answer: Vettius is a Roman, And 'tis his privilege to speak his thoughts. The next, I'll answer: Vettius is a freeman, And never would make compact with a slave. The last, I'll answer: Vettius loves his country; And who that loves his country would betray her? But, say they, âWe have witnesses against him.â Name them! Who stands the first upon the list? A client! I'll oppose to him a senator. Who next? A slave! Set down a Roman knight! Who follows last? The servant of a questor! I'll place a tribune opposite to him! How stand we now? Which weighs the heavier? Their questor's servant, or my tribune?âTheir Slave, or my Roman knight?âTheir client, or My senator? Now, call your witnesses. Mar. We'll have no witnesses! Tit. For your sake, Caius, we acquit him. Mar. Vettius is innocent. Citizens. Ay! ay! ay! Mar. The tribes acquit Vettius by acclamation. Citizens. We do! we do! Opi. Hear me, I say! Citizens. No! no! no! Caius. [Descending from the rostrum.] Their voices are against you, good Opimius! Fla. To please the people, we withdraw our charge. Citizens. Huzza! huzza! Caius. Come, Vettius, come! my brother's friend is free! Citizens. Huzza! huzza! [Caius Gracchus, Vettius, and Citizens go out. Fla. This was their policy!âWhat's to be done? Opi. Remove him from the city, and you nip The danger in the bud. I'll take him for My questor, if you'll name him to the office, And render good account of him. Who waits Until a reptile stings him, ere he crushes it? Tread on it at once! Fla. Your counsel pleases me. Here's the commission I designed for Carbo, All but the name, filled up. In Carbo's place, I'll insert Caius, and despatch it to him. Opi. I leave Rome ere an hour. Fla. He shall have orders Most positive to bear you company. Opi. Of your decision you shall reap the fruits, Or, when you name your friends, leave out Opimius! [Opimius and Tuditanus go out, the scene closes on the rest. SCENE III. âCaius Gracchus's House. Enter Livia and Licinia. Lici. I am the happiest wife in Rome, my Livia! The happiest wife in Rome. Livia. I doubt it not! But there's Flaminius' wife, the other day, Scarce from the Forum to her house could pass For salutations, that her husband won The consulate. Lici. That day, my Caius sat At home with me, and read to me, my Livia. Little cared I who won the consulate! Livia. And there's Lectorius has obtained a government; His wife will be a queen! Lici. Well, let her be so! My queendom is, to be a simple wife. This is my government, my husband's house, Where, when he sits beside me, I'm enthroned. Enough. You'll smile; but, Juno be my witness! I'd rather see him, with his boy upon His knee, than seated in the consul's chair, With all the senate round him. [During this speech she pulls forward the table, &amp;c. and places her embroidery. Livia. Yet his greatness Must needs be thine. Lici. I do not care for greatness: It is a thing lives too much out of doors; 'Tis anywhere but at home; you will not find it Once in a week, in its own house, at supper With the family. Knock any hour you choose, And ask for it; nine times in ten they'll send you To the senate, or the Forum, or to such Or such a one's, in quest of it! 'Tis a month Since Caius took a meal from home, and that Was with my brother. If he walks, I walk Along with him, if I choose; or if I stay Behind, it is a race 'twixt him and the time He promised to be back again, which is first; And when he's back, and the door shut on him, Consummate happy in my world within, I never think of any world without. Livia. Well, then, you are the happiest wife in Rome. Lici. Tell me, and did Flaminius' wife weep, Livia, That day when Rome did salutation to her? Livia. Weep!âNo. Why should she weep? Lici. For happiness. Do you see? I cannot talk of Caius, but I weep, so happy am I! Here's Cornelia; That stately step is hers. She loves me, Livia, Though oft she chides me, that I'd have my Caius Live for his wife alone. Enter Cornelia. Cor. Good day, my Livia. Now would I lose my head, could I not tell What this fair thing, that calls me mother, has Been talking of: if not her husband, then For once hath the hundredth chance turn'd up, with all The ninety-nine against it! Lici. Well, a wife May talk of her husband. Cor. Did I not tell you so? Well, well! I've just now come from thy young Caius; We've almost quarrell'd; would you think it? Mind, Licinia, what I say. That boy's the making Of a man that will not keep on humble terms With Fortune, but walk up to her, and challenge her To smile or frown her most. Lici. It must content me, His father is not such a one. Cor. May be! Lici. Ay, but I'm sure of it! [Sits down to her embroidery. Livia. Good day, Licinia! Cornelia, health be with you! Lici. Must you go? You have not told me yet the morning's news. Livia. Indeed I've heard none, save that Vettius, They say, is to be banish'd, which no doubt You know already. Lici. Not a word of it. What is the time of day? Livia. 'Tis the third hour, And past. Good day again. [Goes out. Cor. Good day, my Livia! Why, my Licinia, what's the matter with you? You've suffered Livia to depart, without Saying good-bye to her. Lici. 'Tis past the time Caius should have been back, almost an hour. Cor. Well, what and if it is? Go on with your work, And while the time away; the sooner he'll Be with you. [Advancing towards her, and looking over her shoulder. Why you've done that rose to the life. A musk-rose, is it not? 'Tis everything Except the scent, and that almost I think I can perceive with looking on't. Indeed, You are a skilful needle! Lici. Do you think Caius hath aught to do with Vettius' trial? Cor. Think what is passing on Olympus! One way Or the other, what concerns it us? Men have Their proper business, which no part it is Of ours to help to manage. Why, that thread's A crimson one you're taking to the leaf? Lici. [Rising.] Cornelia! Mother! Know you anything About Caius? I'm sure you do. You praise My work when I discourse of him; when I question you Concerning him, your answer but puts off The proper one, which, were it good to have, Would you not give it me? I fear, I know Not what! Oh, tell me what have I to fear? Keep me not in the dark! A thing, we see not, Stirring will startle us, which, when light comes, We smile to find it nothing. Cor. Take your seat, And I'll sit down by you; and listen to me. Lici. I thank you now, Cornelia! Cor. Thank me by-and-by; You should, but I doubt you will not. I know nothing Of Caius' measures. Lici. Measures!âHath he measures? Cor. Hath he hands and feet?âHath he brains and heart?âIs he A man?âWhat do you take him for?âHave men No parts to play but lovers?âWhat! are they Not citizens as well?âHave they not crafts, Callings, professions? Women act their parts, Then, when they make their order'd houses know them. Men must be busy out of doors,âmust stir The city,âyea, make the great world aware That they are in it; for the mastery Of which they race, and wrestle, and such feats Perform, the very skies, in wonderment, Echoing Earth's acclaim, applaud them, too! Enter Licinius. What want you with me, my Licinius? [Rising and taking him aside.] You Have come to tell me something. Caius hath spoken For Vettius? I was sure he would! 'Tis done! He has enter'd the listsâhe has stripp'd for the course! I know He will not get fair play, no more than his brother. These fears are not good omens, my Licinius! But let him run it nobly! Lic. Nobly he Has started! Vettius is acquitted. Cor. So far So well. Away! Hurry him home to us,â The sooner here the better! Lici. [Rising.] Stay, Licinius! Cor. I'll tell you all, Licinia; let him go. Caius hath spoken in the Forum for [Licinius goes out. His brother's friend, and they've acquitted him. Lici. [Bursting into tears.] An hour ago I was the happiest wife In Rome! Cor. Licinia, if you are Caius' wife, I am his mother. Is he not dear to me,â My youngest son, and last? Yet do I bear That which I know must come. I know my son: Know thou thy husbandâknow our Caius Gracchus! He loves his mother wellâLicinia better,â His country best! As I, his mother, grudge not That he prefers thee, thou, his wife, repine not That he prefers his country. Both of us Make up our minds to whatsoe'er may follow. Enter Lucius. Luc. My master 's coming, Cornelia, attended by a crowd of citizens, who rend the air with shouts. They say he has procured the acquittal of the noble Vettius. Rome is all joy and exultation. Cor. Run to the door, and wait upon thy master. [Lucius goes out. Hear you, Licinia? Away with these sad looks; Damp not your husband's triumph! Can you hear The people's shouts, and not partake their joy? Lici. I can remember, when Tiberius fell, Not one of all of them had voice enough To bid his murderers hold! Cor. 'Tis well, Licinia! Had he not fallen in a most generous cause, I should have thought of that as well as you! [Shouts without. Enter Caius Gracchus, Lucius, and Attendants. My sonâmy Caius! give you joy!âYou've saved The life of your brother's friend! Caius. Licinia knows it? Cor. She does; go to her. Caius. She has more to learn. Scarce had I left the Forum, when a message From the consul follow'd, giving me the post Of questor, and requiring me on the instant To join Opimius. [Lucius and Attendants go out. Cor. What! and must you leave us? I did not look for this. At once, my Caius? Well, son, I'm ready. Go, prepare thy wife. Caius. What, my Licinia! don't you speak to Caius? Lici. You never said a word of it to me! Re-enter Licinius. Lic. Come, Caius, are you ready? Lici. Ready for what? Caius. To take a ride, wife, and a long one, too. Lic. The general waits. Re-enter Lucius and Attendants, bearing Caius's helmet, sword, and cloak. Lici. The general waits!âWhat general? Where are you going, Caius?âOh, ye gods! What else do ye intend?âTell me the worst! Caius. Love, I'm appointed questor to Opimius; And but a moment have for the farewells 'Twould take a day to speak! Do you trust your Caius? Lici. Do I love thee! Cor. Ay, Licinia, if you love him! Wouldst have thy husband be the lowest man In Rome? Thou knowest none may hope to gain The honours of the state, who have not shown Their prowess in the field. A Roman wife Is married to her husband's glory, not His ease and pleasure. Come, take leave of him. Lici. I'll see you to your horse. Cor. What, with that face? Lici. Will you not see your boy before you go? Caius. I saw him, Sweet, as I came in. Lici. Well, Caius, Farewell! Caius. Now, that's my own Licinia! I'll send you letters, love, day after day. Now, that's my own brave girl, to smile! 'Tis like A sunny morning to a traveller At setting out, which fills him with fair omens. Farewell! Lici. I'll see you to the door. Caius. So do. Keep up your heart, love; I can come to you, You know, at a day's warning!âThink of that. Or you can come to me!âand you will write Dear letters, won't you! every word of which I'll kiss, and think I press the hand that traced them! There now;âand, love, remember, as I shall, Sad parting makes sweet meeting. Now, my Licinia! [They go out. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âA Street in Rome. Enter Fannius. Fan. The gods provide for him! Fame talks of him, As of a theme she could emblazon the more The more she should dilate on't. Enemies Contend with friends which shall outdo the other In vaunting of him. Yea, the hands that hate him Supply him but with richest kindnesses; The bane, they'd work him, turning into good. This questorship, for his undoing meant, Has built him up a thousand times the man He was before; that scarce a day can pass, But something 's added, to swell up the amount Of his o'erflowing fortunes. Enter Flaminius. Fla. Health to Fannius! Opimius is arrived. Fan. I am glad of it. Fla. Something to temper joy,âwould you believe it? Gracchus is now in Rome, or soon to be. What think you? Fan. That, if he returns to Rome, Rome's at his feet. Fla. Come to the senate. Something Must be resolved upon to hurt his credit, And slake the people's joy at seeing him. Fan. Effect but that, thou art a god to Rome! [They go out. SCENE II. âCaius Gracchus' House. Cornelia, Licinia, and Licinius discoveredâLicinia seated at a table. Cor. Are not you pleased at this, Licinia! Lici. No; Nor pleased, yet nor displeased, Cornelia. What care I that the world allows him good And wise? Did I not know him so before? Had I a doubt of it?âWhom did I ask To give their oath of it?âI was content With mine own knowledge. Why should I be glad That all applaud him?âFor his sake?âAlas! For any cause but that! Whom all applaud, Let the tide change, though never change the man, All are as sure to blame! I did not wed Thy son as one would choose an idle gem, To sparkle, for the praise of others' eyes, But that he blazed in mine. Cor. Go on, Licinius. Lic. His very fame more profit brings to Rome, Than the exploits themselves of other men. His fair renown has charmed Micipsa so, That he has sent large store of corn to the army; And his ambassadors have made it known To the senate, in full assembly, that their master Perform'd this from his mere respect for Caius. Cor. Oh, glorious boy! surpass thy mother's hopes! What said the senate?âWere they not struck with this? Did they not own the virtue of my son, And praise the name of Gracchus? Lic. They!âAlas! Their proud blood bows to aught but virtue. No; The ambassadors were spurn'd,âdriven out with shame,â Sent back with scorn, as mere barbarians, who, By showing their just preference of your son, Slighted the senate of its due respect. Lici. Unhappy Caius! thy conspicuous virtue But marks thee out the victim of the senate! Cor. It marks him out the favourite of the gods! Think'st thou I rear'd my son to follow virtue Only for men's acclaim? It ill had fitted The child of Scipio, and had never made me The mother of the Gracchi! [Aside to Licinius.] Say, Licinius, Knows Caius this? Lic. [Aside to Cornelia.] He does, from many hands. His friends are strong. The senate cannot hide His worth from Rome. The people think of Caius As their sole hope; and should he stand for tribune, He must obtain the office. Cor. What! and will He stand for tribune? Wherefore do I ask? Do I not know he will? [Shouts without. Lici. What means that shout? Lic. Forgive me, sister, that I have conceal'd The measures of his friends, who have advised him To show himself at once in Rome. No doubt 'Tis Caius, and the people welcome him. Lici. 'Tis Caius!âHear I right?â'Tis heâMy Caius! Enter Caius Gracchus and Pomponius. Caius. My soul, we meet again!âMy honour'd mother! Cor. The mother is honour'd in her son, my Caius. Caius. Liciniusâfriend and brother! I received Your letters, and I thank you for your care. Licinia, thank the gods! we meet again. How is our boy, love?âHow art thou thyself? Let me look at thee. Well, as my heart could wish! Great Jove! to gaze on such a precious thing, And know it mine! You may smile, Marcus, but There's such a thing as loving one's wife. Licinia, Am I not with thee again? Let him who thinks The world is worth his home, exchange home for it: A little time; he'll find he has lost a world, Not found one! Enter Lucius. Luc. Caius, a messenger From the senate. Caius. Admit him. [Lucius goes out. Mother, you'll give me leave. Licinia, I've many things to tell thee. Count these gems, love; They were a gift to me for thee, from hands That only know thee from thy husband's tongue, Which ne'er could speak the moiety of thy worth! Go with my mother, Sweet! I have neglected Some matters of high duty, just to snatch This look at thee; and those must now be done. Lici. You'll not be long; be with us soon! Caius. No, Sweet! Lici. Remember, now! [Cornelia and Licinia go out. Enter a Lictor. Lictor. The senate, Caius, cites you to appear Before the censors. Caius. Well!âAcquaint the senate I shall obey. Lictor goes out. Pom. 'Twas rumour'd, ere you came, Opimius had return'd; on which account The senate had been suddenly convoked. Caius. I look'd for this! Let me thinkâLet me think!âWhy, yes. Nothing done rashly, nor yet timidly, The mean 's discretion, back'd by calm resolve. I cannot do it!âMy blood 's a point too warm! To hear a man deal out morality, Axiom upon axiomâfor an hour dilate Upon the value of an aphorism,â Amplify to o'errunning in the cause, And then, at every allegation, Invoke no less a witness than high Jove; And know him all the while to play the knave. Great Hercules! it sets my veins a-boiling! Lic. Caius, you would need a rein More firmly ruled than this. Caius. I know itâI know it, As well as you. Hang them! I'll try and play The cautious man for once. 'Tis time to choose New tribunes, is it not? Pom. It is. Caius. You see I'm not at home an hour, and they let loose The dogs upon me! Come!âto the Campus Martius! Now will you see them hold their hands to the gods! That saw my brother's blood upon those hands! They thought I had forgot that brother's death! Why, where's the Tiber?âIs it not at Rome? What!âHas it sunk!ârun out!âFlows it not still, Its yellow hue turn'd purple, ever since! Its waters, blood; which all the floods of heaven Can't change again to water!âBlood! that cries For vengeance at a living brother's hand! Lic. How do you mean to act? Your plans, my Caius? Caius. My plans! Come with me to the Campus Martius! [They go out. SCENE III. âThe Campus Martiusâthe Portico of the Temple of Mars, under which the chairs for the Censors are placed. Enter Titus and Marcus. Tit. So, Caius is returned from the army? Mar. Ay; and there's not an honest man in Rome but's glad of it. Tit. Why gather the people to the Campus Martius? Mar. Here come two senators' gentlemen. They will inform you. Enter Sextus and Quintus. Tit. Health to you, master! Sex. Health to you, master! Tit. Can you tell us why the people gather this way? Sex. For the old reason, friend: we are all good till we're tried. Tit. Ay, indeed! What honest man has turned rogue to-day? Sex. Many a one, I doubt; but chiefly he whom our good citizens believe the honestest in Rome. Mar. Mean you your master, friend? Sex. No; I mean the master of the people; the gentleman who feels for their empty stomachs, and gives them words to eat; your Caius Gracchus, who calls our tradesmen the nobility of Rome; and so indeed they are, if rags can make them so. Mar. No bad evidence! You cannot wear the wool without shearing the sheep. But, pray, what's the matter with Caius Gracchus? Sex. Only that he has returned from the army without his general's leave,ânothing more, except a whisper or two about the tumult at Fregella. 'Tis said he had a hand in it. Mar. What's your opinion? Sex. Believe me, it does not favour him. Tit. What! you like the fare that the patricians give? Sex. What fare? Tit. A good dinner. Caius, you say, feeds the people upon words. A very natural preference! There's not a dog or an ass in Rome that would not be of your mind. Sex. [Raising his staff.] Pray which of the two may you be, friend? Mar. Why ask you? Sex. Oh! merely that, upon occasion, I may know whether I ought to take my foot or my staff to you. No offence, I hope. I have all the respect in the world for you, believe me. Tit. [To Marcus.] You have the worst of it. Let me take him in hand. [To Sextus.] Hark you, master; a word with you. Sex. Your pleasure, master? Tit. How comes your cloak to have that gloss upon it? Sex. Not by partaking of your grease, friend. Tit. My grease! Why, man, there's as much fat in a tanned hide as in all my body! The patricians have sweated me to very leanness, and left me nothing to recruit withal, but hunger and nakedness. Sex. They are right. They find that their cattle grow restive with abundance of provender. Tit. But they feed their curs, friend. Sex. Whom do you call a cur? Tit. Down with your staff, master, for I have another that may ruffle the gloss of your cloak for you. What! has anything surprised you? Do you wonder that the order which wins your battles in the field, should refuse your blows in the city? You despise us when you have no need of us; but if an ounce of power or peculation is to be gained through our means, oh! then you put on your sweet looks, and, bowing to the very belts of our greasy jackets, you exclaim, âFair gentlemen!â kind fellow-citizens!âloving comrades!âsweet, worthy, gentle Romans!âgrant us your voices!â Or, if the enemy is to be opposed, oh! then we are âmen of mettle!ââ(poor starved devils!)ââthe defenders of our country!ââ(that is, your cattle as you call us)âand so indeed we are. We bear your patricians on our backs to victory; we carry them proudly through the ranks of the barbarians! They come off safeâwe get the knocks, the pricks, and the scratches. They obtain crowns and triumphs,âwe cannot obtainâa dinner! They get their actions recordedâwe get ours forgotten! They receive new names and titlesâwe return to our old ones with which you honour usââthe rabble!âthe herd!âthe cattle!âthe vermin! âthe scum of Rome!â Sex. Pray, friend, will you look at this staff of mine? Tit. I look at it, friend. Sex. Is it not a staff, friend? Tit. Yes, if a staff is a staff, friend. Sex. If I am weary, it enables me to rest myself; if I am lame, it helps me to walk; if I quarrel, it knocks down my adversary; and yet, is it not always a staff, friend? Mar. [To Titus.] You have the worst of it now. Let me attack him. Hark you, master. Does your staff ever knock its owner on the pate? Sex. What do you mean? Mar. [Striking him.] Why thus. Sex. Do you want to quarrel? Mar. Oh! by no means. I only wanted to show you the difference between a staff and a man, friend. Tit. Turn on him again. I'll second you, and here is a troop of friends at hand. Qui. Bear with him no longer. Hither comes a band of our comrades. I'll beckon them to make haste. [Calling off.] Come on, come on! These greasy citizens are uttering treason against our masters, the noble patricians. Enter Servants. Mar. Hem!âShall we go over the argument again, master? Is there anything else your staff can do? Sex. Yes; when I carry it heedlessly, it sometimes chances toâtrip me. [Trips Marcus. Tit. Help, help, there! [Enter Citizens.âConfused cry of âDown with the Citizens!â âDown with the Slaves and Servants!â They are about to attack each other, when Flaminius's voice without stops them. Enter Flaminius, Tuditanus, Opimius, Senators, two Censors, and twelve Lictors. Fla. Hold! hold! I charge you, you rash citizens! What means this tumult? How! is peace so old That you are weary of it? Who began This fray? Sex. That caitiff yonder. Tit. Our old names! Mar. 'Twas that patrician's hireling that began it. Caius Gracchus, and his Friends Pomponius and Licinius, appear behind. Opi. Silence! ye wrangling discontented men! Ye pest of Rome! What stirs you to this brawl? I know your cue!âYour Gracchus has return'd, And ye give signal straight of discontent, Conspiracy, and foul rebellion! A noble leader for your noble party! A glorious soldier, that returns to Rome Without his general's leave! A worthy son Of Rome, that tampers with her enemies, And instigates her allies to revolt! An honest patriotâ [Seeing Caius Gracchus close to him, he checks himself. Caius. Proceed, Opimius! Now is your proper time to speak. I am hereâ Gracchus is here! Gracchus, that draws not on A foe behind his back! [Opimius is confusedâhe walks sullenly to the place appointed for him as the accuser of Caius Gracchus âGracchus fixes his eyes steadfastly upon Opimius, who betrays considerable embarrassment. Opi. [Recovering.] This lofty bearing Befits the man who quits his post, without His general's leave; and used the sacred power His office gave him, to pervert the faith His duty 'twas to guard; as, amply, can Fregella testify! Caius. Is this your charge? Censors! I'll save your labour. It appears I am cited here, because I have return'd Without my general's leave, and for the crime Of having raised the tumult at Fregella. First, with the first. I have remain'd my time; Nay, I have overserved it by the lawsâ The laws which Caius Gracchus dares not break. But, censors, let that pass. I shall propose A better question for your satisfaction: âHow have I served my time?â I'll answer that. âHow have I served my time?âââFor mine own gain, Or that of the republic?â What was my office? Questor. What was its nature? Lucrative; So lucrative, that all my predecessors, Who went forth poor, return'd home richâso rich Their very wine-vessels resign'd their store Of fluid wealth, only for wealthier freight Of solid gold. I went forth, poor enough; But have return'd still poorer than I went. Then, for my conduct as a soldier, I do not blush to say, I have prevail'd By mercy more than rapine. I have won From enemies their hearts, before their arms; And held the tributary states to Rome, By friendship more than fear. I have answer'd that. First Censor. If you have served your time, and faithfully Discharged your duty, as a Roman questor, So far you are acquitted. Opi. To the next, thenâ The tumult at Fregella. Caius. Ay, to that! Produce your proofs! Opi. I charge you, as your general. Caius. Your proofsâyour evidenceâyour witnesses. Opi. Is it from thee I hear this haughty challenge? Who best should know thy actions? Wast thou not Mine officer? I charge thee with the treason. Before the gods, I charge thee with it, Caius; I say, I charge thee as thy general. Caius. Thou daring noble! Is it to the face Of these upright authorities, thou claim'st To be at once the witness and accuser? Say, censors, is it fit? Is it the law? First Censor. The law permits it not. The accusation And proof, in such a case, cannot reside In the same person. Caius Gracchus, therefore, Is free, unless you furnish other warrant For his impeachment. [The Censors rise. Opi. Censors, it is fit You look to the public safety. If our criminals Escape their penalties, your prisons and Your chains will soon be our inheritance. Caius. Have the laws lost their reverence? Fla. The charge Is heavy! Caius. Heavy as the proofs are light. Ye citizens of Rome, behold what favour Your masters show your brethren! I have borne My country's arms with honour; overserved My time; return'd in poverty, that might Have amass'd treasures; and they thus reward meâ Prefer a charge against me without proof, Direct or indirectâwithout a testimony, Weighty or lightâwithout an argument, Idle or plausibleâwithout as much Of feasibility, as would suffice To feed suspicion's phantom! Why is this? How have I bought this hatred? When my brother, Tiberius Gracchus, fell beneath their blows, I call'd them not assassins! When his friends Fell sacrifices to their after-vengeance, I did not style them butchers! When their hatred Drove the Numidian nobles from the senate, With scoffs and execrations, when they praised me, And to my cause assign'd the royal bounty Of King Micipsa, still I did not call them The proud, invidious, insolent patricians! [The people cheer vehemently. Opi. Hear ye! Caius. Ye men of Rome, there is no favour For justice!âGrudgingly her dues are granted! Your great men boast no more the love of country! They count their talentsâmeasure their domainsâ Number their slavesâmake lists of knights and clientsâ Enlarge their palacesâdress forth their banquets, Awake their lyres and timbrels, and with their floods Of ripe Falernian, drown the little left Of Roman virtue! Opi. He would raise a tumult! Caius. This hand 's the first to turn against the man, Whoe'er he be, that favours civil discord! I have no gust for blood, Opimius! I sacrifice to justice and to mercy! Opi. He has aspersed the justice of our order; He flatters the plebeians, and should be Attach'd and brought to question for this conduct. Caius. Romans, I ask the office of your tribune! [Tumultuous cheers. Mar. Ay! you shall have it! Gracchus shall be tribune! Tit. Gracchus tribune! Caius Gracchus tribune! Opi. Stay, friends! Take heed! Beware of flatterers! Caius. The laws! the laws! that guard the common right! The wealth, the happiness, the freedom of The nation! Who has hidden themâdefaced themâ Sold themâcorrupted them from the pure letter? Why do they guard the rich man's cloak from a rent, And tear the poor man's garment from his back? Why are they, in the proud man's grasp, a sword, And in the hand of the humble man, a reed? The laws! the laws! I ask you for the laws! Demand them in my country's sacred name! Still silent? Reckless still of my appeal? Romans! I ask the office of your tribune! [Caius Gracchus and his party go out, followed by Citizens, shouting. Opi. Stop him from rising, or our order falls! [Opimius, and the rest, go out. SCENE IV. âA Streetâa Gate of the City. Enter Titus and Marcus, with Citizens. Tit. The work goes nobly on! Caius is sure to be tribune. This is a happy day for Rome! Mar. Ay, the people will have their rights. We shall know ourselves now, masters. See, hither comes a crowd of voters; let us speak to them. Enter Voters. Health to you, masters! Are you going to vote? First Voter. Yes; if we can find an honest candidate. Mar. Here's one ready to your hands, masters; Caius Gracchus. Choose him, and you'll do good service to your country. He'll see that you shall have your rights, nor will the patricians dare to curl their noses when they pass us, as if we were so much carrion. Look you, masters, Caius is a friend of the plebeians; he respects our order, and so he ought; and, therefore, let every good citizen support him. Away, my friends! Vote, and cry, Caius! Voters. Caius Gracchus! Huzza! [They go out. Mar. He's sure of the election. The patricians will eat poor suppers to-night. Enter Voters. Save you, masters; are you going to vote for the right candidate? First Voter. Do you think we'd vote for the wrong one? Tit. Then you'll vote for Caius Gracchus? First Voter. No; I don't like him. They say he'll bring the state into danger. We are men that love peace and concord. Tit. Ay, and good feeding. Hark you, master; take these cattle to the stalls of the patricians. The patricians make profitable masters. They give stripes only now and then; but that's nothing, you know, to a kindly beast. Away, I say!âto the stalls with them! [They go out severally. Enter Licinia and Cornelia. Cor. Caius, you see, is nowhere to be found. Let us go home again. Lici. Not till I see him. Livia was right; he'll surely stand for tribune. Let's seek him in the Forum. Cor. Are you mad? Go to the Forum after him! All Rome Would talk of it. When did you know a wife Follow her husband to the Forum? Why, 'Twould set all fingers pointing! Men would say, âCaius did well to take a wife to school him;â And every woman would cry âshameâ upon him. I'd rather lose a husband, than have people So talk of mine. Lici. You wish him to be tribune? Cor. Licinia, no; I wish it not, my daughter; But still I know, that if he will be tribune, He will; and, knowing that, the unwelcome thought That needs must be my guest I treat with grace, For mine own dignity, and his contentment, Which should not, profitless, be marr'd. [Shouts without. My child, Why do you grasp me by the arm, and tremble? The people shout for joy. Lici. It is a kind Of joy that's fearful to my mind. The breeze That kindly bears the gladsome bark along, Has oft been known to grow the hurricane That sends her to the bottom! Cor. Take her, Livia. Go, both of you, look down the other street, While I watch here. 'Chance you may light on Caius. [Licinia and Livia go out. 'Tis Marcus, and with news! She's best away! Mar. [Entering.] Cornelia!â Cor. Quick!âYour news! What has he done? Mar. Proposed himself for tribune! Cor. Full well I knew that it would come to this! And I could tell what further it will come to, If I would. No matter. Two such sons as mine Were never made for mothers that have eyes Afraid of tears. Why did I rear my boys Companions for the gods, if not for this? Many a time, when they stood before me, Such things as mothers seldom look upon, And I have seem'd to feed on them with mine eyes; My thoughts have ponder'd o'er the bier, where they Lay stiff and cold! I would not see them so If I could help it; but I would not help it To see them otherwise, and other men. My Caius must be tribune! [Shouts several times, approaching nearer. Lic. [Entering.] Caius is tribune! Those shouts proclaim it. [Looking off.] See, Cornelia, He comes! Behold!âLook how they hem him round! Why do you turn away? Cor. I turn away To see that flush of triumph on his cheek Which lights it as he felt himself a god; And think how I may, after, see that cheek, And think upon that flush! Licinia 's well Away; it had o'ercome her quite. Come, Licinius. [Cornelia and Licinius retire. Enter Caius Gracchus, Drusus, Pomponius, Titus, Marcus, and Citizens, shouting. Caius. No more, my friends!âno more of this, I pray you! Disperse to your several homes. Why do you give These honours to your servant? Tit. Suffer us To see you to your house. Mar. Yes, Caius, yes, We'll hail your honour'd mother and your wife. Pom. Indulge the people, Gracchus. Caius. Well, my friends, If you will go with meâ[Seeing Cornelia.] My honour'd mother! Cor. May the great gods, who crown'd thee with this triumph, Instruct thee so to use it as to bless Thy country! With a firm and mighty hand, Mayst thou uphold the laws, and keep them ever Above the proud man's violence, and within The poor man's reach; so shall thy motherâRomeâ Acknowledge thee her son, and teach thy name To the applauding tongues of after-ages! Who is your brother tribune? Caius. Worthy Drusus. Cor. [To Drusus.] My son is happy in his colleague, sir, And let me trust, will not dishonour him. Dru. My honour is to second him, Cornelia. Caius. Come, mother. [Going. Re-enter Licinia and Livia, meeting them. Lic. Ha! Licinia! Cor. [Going up to her.] My Licinia! For Caius' honour act like Caius' wife: He's tribune. Lici. Tribune! Cor. Think what eyes are on you! You are the mother of a Roman, too! Summon your spirits! That's my daughter! Come Up to him now at once, and wish him joy,â 'Tis but an effort, and the words are out! Lici. [Crossing to Caius.] Caius,â Caius. Licinia! Lici. Caius! I do give you joy! [She faints on his arm, and the curtain drops. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA Street in Rome. Enter Flaminius and Opimius. Opi. Mark'd you, Flaminius, how they look'd at us? That was defiance. I could read the name Of Gracchus on those daring brows of theirs. Behoves us now a meek look, where, before, We gave a scowl. The people are our masters. That Rome should ever see it! Fla. We must bear it. Opi. Ay, while our blood boils! We must smile, Flaminius, And, at the same time, grind our teeth, if so It pleases Gracchus. Gods! that a man I could take By the throat and smiteâyea, set my foot upon For perfect loathing,âwhom I should think it righteous To slay in a templeâay, by Hercules! At the altar of a templeâthat a man Like that should order me, and do it too By vilest instruments! It is a task For patience! Fla. Never king was absolute In Rome as he; his will is law. Popilius Can witness that, self-banish'd to escape A heavier doom. The senate has he lopp'd Of half its power, with his three hundred knights Whom he has named assistants to it, with Equality of voices. Then, the state Our modest tribune keeps! He never moves But in a crowd of knights, ambassadors, Soldiers, and magistrates, artificers, And men of letters, that attend upon him. There's not a man in Rome but Caius Gracchus. Opi. Nay, there's another, my Flaminius; His colleague, Livius Drusus. Don't you know him? Fla. I do. A quiet, simple, honest man, Who follows Gracchus with a modest zeal, And rather seems, from an unaiming spirit, To second his designs, than help them on From principle. Opi. You have described him well, As he appears; I know him as he is. 'Tis opportunity that proves a man; And, trust me, Livius Drusus is not one, That, having power, lacks will, to overtop His fellow. I shall use this Livius Drusus, To combat Gracchus, with the very means That make him to be fear'd. Have patience, and You'll see my policy. They're coming to The ForumâDrusus last! This shows me my Exordium. Enter Caius Gracchus, preceded by a Lictor, Licinius, Pomponius, Flaccus, Fulvius, Titus, Marcus, twelve Citizens, and Drusus last. Caius. Health to Flaminius! Fla. Health to Gracchus! Opi. What business is to-day before the commons? Caius. Some colonies we think to send from Rome, To the late conquer'd cities. Does Opimius Approve the measure? Opi. Gracchus asks the question, As though he thought Opimius did not love The people's good. 'Twere happy for the people, If those, who flatter them, loved it as well. Caius. Whom does Opimius call the people's flatterer? Opi. Him who would feed the people's vanity, By making them aspire above themselves. Caius. Opimius, then, is not the people's flatterer. How does he rate them? As we rate our herds. How would he use them? As we use our herds. Oh! may the people ever have such flatterers As guard them from the kindness of such friends! [Caius Gracchus and his party go outâDrusus is following him, when Opimius, with affected surprise, stops him. Opi. Why, Livius Drusus, is it you? I thought You were not come abroad to-day. No wonder: You're not the man, methinks, it suits to close The train that waits upon your colleague there. Ah, Drusus! if the Romans knew their friends, They would not follow Gracchus thus, and leave His betters at their heels! Dru. I do not court Their favour, good Opimius. It contents me To know that I discharge, with honesty, The duty of their tribune. Opi. Livius Drusus, There's not a man in Rome but, if he speaks The truth, will say, you do. I say it for one. So does Flaminius. Were you not hurried now, There's something, Drusus, I would say to show you What men think of you; but, as 'tis, I'll keep it Till you have time. Yet this, before you go, I would I were a bosom-friend of yours, To do you a friend's office. Give me your hand! I like you, Drusus, you're an honest tribune! I say, I like you; and if I did not say it Behind your back, I would not to your face. Farewell! Perhaps you're not so call'd for, neither, But you could spare a moment? Dru. If it be Your pleasureâ Opi. Thank you, Drusus, thank you! This Is very kind of you. You know Flaminius? Dru. I know his fair report. Opi. You know himself, then; But know him better. Take him by the hand. [Flaminius crosses to Drusus, and takes his hand. He wants to know you better than by report. Dru. I would I knew how to deserve this honour. Opi. I would you knew what honour you deserve! Drusus, it is their loss, and yet their grace, That men of true worth seldom know themselves,â Whence mere pretension gets the upper hand,â And such the mass account as common men, As the unskill'd will oft take unwrought gold For brass. Drusus, it makes me mad To see the sterling'st ore thrown by, and what Is basest, hoarded only for the stamp Which the other only wants! I wish I had The coining of you, Drusus! Dru. You would find You overweigh'd me. Opi. Not a grain, by Jupiter! Or never weigh'd I yet an honest man. And here's to try it. Would you, Drusus, dare To achieve a thing you could and ought? Dru. I were not A man else. Opi. Every one that knows you, Drusus, Knows that you are a man, but are you such A man? Dru. I think I am. Opi. I think so, too. But, ever, what we most desire to be We fear may not be, though we know not why We fear it.âDrusus, I'll deal frankly with you; I will not hesitate, nor wind about, Nor speak by halves, as if I fear'd to let My thoughts go from me. Listen to me, then. Rome is in dangerâdiscord reigns in her; Her orders are opposed among themselves, The people hate the senate, call us proud, Cruel, luxurious, avaricious; masters, Oppressors, tyrantsâmen, alas! my Drusus, That are not masters even of their own! The cause of this is Caius Gracchus. He, For his own aims, lets no occasion pass To inflame the commons; wherefore, he revives Old grievances, or fancies present, or Predicts to come; and should his course hold on Without obstruction, Rome will rue the end! The senate, Drusus, justly fearing this, Have much debated on the remedy: And all at length agree there is but one, Namely, to find a man that's fit to mediate Between them and the people. Drusus, thou Art he! Dru. Alas! what weight have I, Opimius, To bear against the weight of Caius Gracchus? Opi. What weight hast thou! Thou good and honest man! Now, by the gods, I love thee, Drusus, for Thy true simplicity! What weight hast thou! Why, hast thou not the weight of Caius Gracchus? You share one officeâthe same cares divide, The same responsibilities; why not The same respect? Oh, Livius Drusus! Caius Were not content did Drusus lead the people, And Gracchus humbly follow at their heels! But let that pass. Deal frankly with a friend. What think you, Drusus? Do the senate hate The people? Dru. Nay, I would believe they did not. Opi. I know you would; I think you do; but much I wonder that you do. 'Tis not the fashion I love you, Drusus!âDrusus, do you think I shuffle with you?âDo not answer me! I am sure you do not. Take my word then, Drusus: The senate love the people. Ay, I know 'Tis easily said, but I will prove it to you. Know, then, I have been deputed to solicit Your friendship for the senateânot to oppose, As once Octavius did the former Gracchus, But to outdo your colleague in his plans In favour of the people, still proposing Some law for their additional advantage; And only statingâas in simple fairness You shouldâthat so the senate had express'd Their wishesânothing farther. By this means, The people will be served; the senate placed Again in confidence; your rival stripp'd Of dangerous influence; yourself exalted, According to your worth; and, to sum up The whole at once, your country saved from ruin. Fla. You cannot hesitate in such a cause? Dru. I undertake the trust with sacred zeal; And, if I can compose the present evils, Shall deem myself most happy. Opi. I am sure of it, And shall with joy report this to the senate. Meanwhile, be often with us. Let us know Your wishes for the people; we'll promote them. What you say should be, shall be, on your saying, Or break at once with us. The tribes shall know What 'tis to have a tribune of repute, Who does not use his office to promote Cabal, and strife, and jealousy, and hate, Like certain gentlemen. To your work at once! But, hark you, Livius Drusus; tell me truly, Are you not over modest? Come! confess, now. I know you areâI know, that, should the senate Give you your choice of honours, you'd refuse To challenge e'en the smallest! Well, no matter! Such men live for their country. Heed not Gracchus, If he upbraid youâIf? Should the plebeians Give but one shout for Drusus, he'll be sick With all the gall of envy! Come to the senate To-morrow. Be not strange with us, good Livius! Mark him now! Heed him well, for he is wily, And thou art simple in thine honesty. You'll come to the senate, to-morrow? Eye him, Drusus; He's a rank traitor! Mind to-morrow, now. So, farewell, honest Drusus! [Drusus goes out. Fla. Nobly play'd! Opi. Beyond my hopes. Let us inform our friends; And as the choice of tribunes is at hand, Prevent his re-election. [Shouts.] That's for Gracchus! Ay, shout away! Unmoved, we'll hear you soon: The trap is ready: Let the lion roar! [They go out. SCENE II. âThe Forum. Caius Gracchus discovered in the RostrumâTitus, Marcus, and Citizensâthe people shout. Caius. No more, my friends! How often must I tell you, You should not pay these honours to your tribune? Tit. Long may you live, Caius! Mar. Prosperously and long! Hither comes honest Drusus. Shall we shout for him? Tit. Why should we? Think you, he is any great friend to the people? Not he! Is he not a quiet, easy, contented man, who lets things take their course? Can such a man be a friend to the people? No, no; he is no friend to the people. He is well enough in his place, because he keeps a rogue out of it; and just says ay, and no, according to the will of Caius. Mar. You say right. For my part, I never liked your peaceful, honest man. Give me a stirring fellow, that will browbeat the nobles, and call the authorities to account. That's your only tribune. Enter Drusus. Caius. Drusus, I have waited for you! I am glad you have come. Mar. [Apart to Titus.] Observe, he hasn't hurried himself. [To the Citizens.] Make way for Drusus!â[Drusus ascends the rostrum.] Make way thereâLet the good man pass! You may know by his gait that he loves high feeding, and sleeps one-half of the day, for having dozed away the other half. Tit. Silence! Caius is going to speak. Cheer him, masters! All. Huzza! Long live Caius! Caius. Here, Romans, are some drafts of new decrees We mean to offer for your approbation. I know not whether you will think them wise; But this I know, the hand that drew them up, Belongs to one, who would die to do you good. Tit. Worthy Caius! All. Long may you live, Caius! Caius. With grief we see you bare of many goods, That make life sweet. Your wretchedness afflicts The heart of Caius. Thousands of brave men, Wandering about the streets of Rome, without Means, or employment to procure them! Now, We here direct two colonies to be sent To the late conquer'd cities. Tit. Noble Caius! Mar. Worthy Caius! All. [Shouting.] Caius for ever! Dru. My countrymenâ Mar. Drusus is going to speak. Now for an oration! Dru. You need not learn I lack those noble parts, Which make the orator you love to hear. I have no merit but my honesty; And 'tis my honesty that says to you, I'd die with Caius for the good of Rome! Tit. Yes, yes; Drusus is an honest, quiet, good sort of man. That everybody must say for him; but as for his speech, I'd make as good a one myself. Cheer him, masters âcheer him! [The people cheer faintly. Dru. I do not ask you to applaud me, Romans; I love your welfare better than your praise. Mar. Come, come, that's very well, now; cheer for that, masters;âvery well, indeed, for Drusus! Cheer! cheer! [They cheer louder. Dru. I thank you, fellow-citizens. Don't mind me. Mar. Cheer him again, masters! [A general cheer. Dru. Romans, I know my colleague's love for you; And yet, methinks, he stints it in this measure. Two colonies! What are two colonies? Two handfuls! He should stretch this grant, and ease The groaning and debilitated state! Two handfuls of the people, to two cities! Caius for once adopts half-measures. I Propose, that to each city there be sent Three thousand of the poorest citizensâ Three thousand to each city. Mar. Worthy Drusus! noble Drusus! Huzza! All. Huzza! Dru. Countrymen, Pay me no thanks! Indeed you owe me none; I only speak the wishes of the senate. Mar. The senate! May we cheer for the senate? Tit. To be sure, if they do the people good! Mar. Huzza for the senate, masters! huzza! All. Huzza! Caius. Indeed! The senate! For the people's sake, We, also, thank the senate. Worthy Romans, Now our affairs put on a prosperous face, The senate send you favours. We thank the senate! But not this mighty kindness of the senate Can set my cares at rest. I have made an estimate Of certain waste uncultivated lands, South of the Tiber. Theseâhowever, subject To certain trifling services and rentsâ We here allot to fifteen hundred families From the plebeians of the lowest class. Tit. Noble Caius! worthy Caius! Cheer, masters! Mar. Stop! Drusus is going to speak. Hear what Drusus says. Dru. Romans, my worthy colleague, whom I honour, Seems not to love that you should owe the senate Favour or justice. Caius. Drusus! Mar. Go on, Drusus! let him go on! Come, come, Drusus must have fair play. All. Drusus! Drusus! Dru. If 'tis your pleasure, friends, to hear my colleague Rather than me, you only have to say it. All. No! no! no! Go on! go on! Dru. I care not who befriends you, worthy citizens; The senate or the tribunes. The more friends You have, the less you will have need of me. Mar. Good, honest man, go on! All. Go on! go on! Dru. I sayâand if I know the thing I say, Am I not right in saying it?âI say, The senate wish the people to be happy, And do not want to tax them. Noble Caius Might have gone farther in this act of his, And not displeas'd the senate; therefore, I, Without regard to his decree, enact, That certain waste, uncultivated lands, Lying north of Rome, be straight parcell'd out To fifteen hundred of the poorest families, Free of all rent and service. Mar. A noble decree, noble Drusus! The worthy senate! Huzza for Drusus and the senate! Dru. My friends, think not of Drusus! Thank the senate. Mar. Good, honest man! He is too modest to take the praise to himself; he gives it all to the senate. Observe Caius; he changes colour; he envies Drusus; he doesn't like the applause we give to Drusus. Applaud the good man again. Long live Drusus! Drusus and the senate for ever! Huzza! All. Huzza! Caius. May I be heard, my friends? Tit. Speak, Gracchus, speak! Mar. Drusus for ever! Caius. RomeâRome, my friends, for ever! Whoe'er is goodâwhoe'er is just and greatâ The honour be to Rome, our common mother! I have warn'd you oft! Look to your liberties,â Beware the senate's arts! beware her tools! Dru. How! Caiusâ Caius. Nay, good Livius Drusus! Mar. Not a word against Drusus! All. No! no! no! Mar. The senate has acted well in this. All. It has! it has! Caius. I am contentâIf you approve it, masters, I am content. I cannot help my fears; But let it pass. I'll say, I am content! Masters, I never yet incurr'd your censure: If I am over-watchful for your safety, Guarding you 'gainst the chance of treachery,â If I suspectâBut, since it pleases you, I'll not suspect this kindness of the senate! And yet it may be ask'dâwhen you were weak, And needed friends, where was the senate's kindness? Then you might help yourselves; now you are strong, It stretches forth its hands to give you aid! I think, 'twas not the kindness of the senate That gave me counsel, when my first decree Declared the magistrate to be infamous, Who was deposed by judgment of the people. Or, when my next enacted, that the magistrate, Who banish'd, without law, a citizen, Should answer the assembly of the people. Or, when, to give you plenitude of power, I granted each inhabitant of Latium The right of suffrage! Tit. Hear him! hear him! Mar. Silence! Drusus is going to speak. Dru. Romans, I'll not pretend to say how much You owe the senate; be it much, or little, Or nothing. Only, while they wish to serve you, I'll not speak ill of them. They have desired me To show you favour. Mark meâhave desired me! Should I be jealous of them? Words, my friends, Are air; but actions are substantial things, That warrant judgment. But we'll not debate Their truth or falsehood. They appear to favour us, And let us take advantage of their seeming! My colleague, Caius, as he just now said, Has given to the inhabitants of Latium The right to voteâthe right of citizens. Has not this act, then, made them citizens? And yet, my friends, the Latin soldier feels The scourgeâHe feels the scourge!âan infamy, That never should approach the freeman's back! We now decree, that it shall be unlawful, Henceforth for any captain of our legions To beat with rods a soldier of that nation. Mar. A noble decree!âWorthy Drusus!âA noble decree! Huzza! Dru. My friends, I now depart; but, ere I leave you, Let me declare, that whatsoe'er I have done, I have done with the approval of the senate. [Descends from the rostrum. Mar. We'll follow you home, Drusus! [Gracchus hurries down the steps.] We'll follow you home! We'll cheer the senators as we pass them; we'll follow you home! Dru. Nay, my good friends! Mar. Come, come; let us follow him to his house. Dru. Well; since you will not be deniedâ [Going. Caius. Stay, Livius Drusus! Let me speak with you. Dru. Your pleasure, Caius? Caius. Pleasure! Livius Drusus, Look not so sweet upon me. I am no child Not to know bitter, for that it is smear'd With honey! Let me rather see thee scowl A little. When thou speak'st, remind me rather Of the rough trumpet, more than the dulcet lute. By Jove! I can applaud the honest caitiff That shows his craft. Dru. The caitiff! Caius. Ah!âHo!âNow You are Livius Drususâthat was just before The man we took you forâthe easy man, That, so the world went right, cared not who got The praise; but rather from preferment shrunk, Than courted it. Who ever thought, in such A plain and homely piece of stuff, to see The crafty senate's tool? Dru. The senate's tool! Caius. Now, what a deal of pains for little profit! If you could play the juggler with me, Liviusâ To such perfection practise seeming as To pass it on me for realityâ Make my own senses witness 'gainst myself, That things I know impossible to be, I see as palpable as if they were: 'Twere worth the acting; but, when I am master Of all your mystery, and know, as well As you do, that the prodigy's a lie, What wanton waste of labour! Livius Drusus, I know you are a tool! Dru. Well, let me be so. I will not quarrel with you, worthy Caius; Call me whate'er you please. Caius. What barefaced shifting! What real fierceness could grow tame so soon! You turn upon me like a tiger, and When open-mouth'd I brave you, straight you play The crouching spaniel! You'll not quarrel with me! I want you not to quarrel, Livius Drusus, But only to be honest to the people. Dru. Honest! Caius. Ay, honest! Why do you repeat My words, as if you fear'd to trust your own? Do I play echo? Question me, and see If I so fear to be myself, to act The wall, which speaks not but with others' tongues! I say you are not honest to the people!â I say you are the senate's toolâtheir baitâ Their jugglerâtheir trick-merchant! If I wrong you, Burst out at once, and, free, retort upon me; Tell me I lie, and smite me to the earth! I'll rise and, then, embrace you. Dru. My good Caius, Restrain your ardent temper! It betrays you Into madness. Caius. Give me but an answer, and I'll be content. Are you not leagued with the senate? Dru. Your wit forsakes you, Caius! Caius. Will you answer me? Dru. Throw off this humour! Caius. Give me an answer, Drusus. Dru. Madman! Caius. Are you the creature of the senate? Dru. Good Caius! Caius. Do you juggle with the people? Let me but know you, man, from your own lips;â There wants but that, you know, to prove the traitor. Dru. The traitor! Caius. Ay! Dru. To whom? Caius. To the poor people,â The houseless citizens, that sleep at nights Beneath the portals, and that starve by day Under the noses of the senators! Thou art their magistrate, their friend, their father: Dost thou betray them? Hast thou sold them? Wilt thou Juggle them out of the few friends they have left? Dru. If 'twill content you, Caius, I am one Who loves alike the senate and the people,â I am the friend of both. Caius. The friend of neither! The senate's tool!âa traitor to the people! A man that seems to side with neither party; Will now bend this way, and then make it up, By leaning a little to the other side:â With one eye, glance his pity on the crowd, And with the other, crouch to the nobility! Such men are the best instruments of tyranny! The simple slave is easily discern'd By his external badge: your order wears The infamy within! Dru. I'll leave you, Caius, And hope your breast will harbour better counsels. Grudge you the senate's kindness to the people? 'Tis well! Whoe'er serves them, shows love to me. [Goes out, followed by the people, shouting. Caius. Go! I have till'd a waste, and, with my sweat, Brought hope of fruitage forth. The superficial And heartless soil cannot sustain the shoot: The first harsh wind that sweeps it, leaves it bare! Fool that I was to till it! Let them go! I loved them and I served them!âLet them go! Enter Vettius. Vet. Why, Caius, what's the matter, that the people Crowd after Drusus? Caius. Matter! Know you why The wind was all the morning in the south, Sits now at northâCanst show the cause of that? When thou canst tell why turns the fitful wind, I'll tell thee why the people follow Drusus! Vet. More wonder yet! There stood a group of senators Under a portico, and, as they pass'd, They cheer'd themâcheer'd the senators! I thought They must be mad. Caius. No, no! they are not mad. There's not a day in the month, or year, they are Of sounder mind. They know as well to-day, As they did yesterday, what things they look atâ That Rome is Rome; that I am Caius; he They follow, Drusus; and the senators, They cheer, the senators! They are not mad; But thou art mad to think them so, because They act the deeds of madmen! Enter Licinius. Lic. Caius!âHa! Well met. Bad news! Caius. Bad news, and well met, say you? Why, so it is: for, were you Pluto's herald, You could not pluck a smile from Caius' cheek, Would pay the labour of destroying. Come, Your news! Lic. Opimius will be consul. Caius. Well; I'm tribune. Lic. Pray you, show yourself among The people, else their hearts are lost. Your enemies have won them, half, already! Orders shake hands!âPatrician and plebeian, That walk'd, before, so wide asunder, now Go arm in arm!âQuinctius is mate for Curtius, That kisses shoulders with him!âLivius, for Servius That plucks great Livius by the cloak; and, then, Knits fingers with him, while he whispers in His ear, and calls him his âgood Livius;â who Leans cheek to him, and smiles, though, all the while He cares as much for Servius, as he does For Servius' shoe! Let them not, Caius, have The game to themselves! Dispute it with them! Come Among the people! Caius. Never did I play The beggar yet, nor will I now! 'Tis not My craft, nor will I learn it, Marcus; no, Not e'en to win the people! Enter Pomponius. Pom. Where is Caius? Caius. Here! here! What makes the man in such request That's out of favour with the people? Pom. Look To your office! Half the votes are promised 'gainst The next Comitia. Spare no pains to win The people's favour back again; or, mind! You are no longer tribune. Lic. Persuade him not; you will but lose your labour. Let us go to the people, and convince them, 'Tis for their safety, they retain their tribune. [Goes out. Pom. Follow him, Caius! Seek the people! Caius. Not a foot I'll stir to win them. Though the price of their love Were but the breath that ask'd for't, it should go Unbought for me! What! would they take our tigers, They've seen a hundred times tear limb from limb The malefactorâwould they take them, think you, For dogs, suppose they fawn'd on them? No wonder And if they should! I will not go among them, To pay court to them for their own sakes; cry, âBe served, I pray you, masters! pray you, be served! Consent that I supply you food; provide you Clothing and lodging; find you lands to till!ââ While, all the time, they lean the ear to Drusus, And I must pull them by the cloak to win Attention! No! No honest man could do it! I will not go among them! If they are told That poison 's poison, yet will swallow it For food, in Jove's name, let them! Nothing but The proving on't will satisfy them. Vettius, Keep silence! No man further urge me! I should notâcannotâwill not court the people! [Goes out, followed by Vettius and Pomponius.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âA Street in Rome. Enter Vettius and Pomponius. Pom. It was a false return. He had their votes, Though he has lost his office. Lo you, now, What strides they take that used to walk before So circumspectly! Scarcely is he brought Into a private state again, than they Proceed to abrogate his laws. This blow, If there it light, where it is meant it should, Will not fall short a hair's breadth of his life. Vet. You may be sure of it! To compass that Opimius got the consulship. Pom. This morning, Caius and he met near the Capitol; Flaccus held Caius by the arm;âOpimius, On seeing him, makes a dead stand, and then, With eyes fix'd on him thus, and folded arms, He follows him right round, and cries to him, âWhat, hoa! you, Caius Gracchus, whither now? What plot 's on foot?â Then falls on him with such A torrent of vile terms, as it would sting The tamest looker-on to hear. Vet. And how Did Caius bear it? Pom. Why, as one that, seeing A tiger ready couch'd to spring upon him, In quick avoidance finds security. He pass'd in silence on. Opimius had His Candiot troops with him. But where is Flaccus? Vet. Gone to bring Caius to the Forum. How Have you disposed our Latin friends? Pom. About The rostrum. Vet. Fear not! If it comes to numbers, Ours can tell theirs thrice over. Enter Licinius. Lic. Friends, well met! Something's on foot that bodes not good to Caius. I pass'd just now a group of senators: One of them named him, and had farther spoken, But that another placed, on seeing me, His finger on his lip. You may be sure They only want occasion to despatch him. Vet. All Rome perceives it. Men inquire for him As one whom mischief dogs: âIs Caius well? When saw you him?âDoes he go out to-day To the Forum?ââhalf under breath, as fearing for The answer. Others, as his friends pass by, Lay heads together, and, with eyes glanced towards them, Whisper with looks, portentous. Some do smile That never smiled before on aught that loved him. That's the worse sign! A smile from those that hate us, Ensures some scowl of fate about to fall, If not already lowering. Pom. What's to be done? Lic. Meet them with force. Pom. Agreed! Vet. Agreed! Lic. Away, then! If you have any friend as yet unpledged, Change oaths with him. Vet. When meet we in the Forum? Lic. At the third hourâIt is the hour of his fate! If they repeal his laws, farewell to Rome! [They go out. SCENE II. âAn Apartment in Caius Gracchus's House âtwo chairs. Enter Cornelia and Licinia. Lici. You'll speak to him? Cor. I will. Lici. You'll urge him not To go? You would not throw your richest gem Away, though you might give't to one who knew Its value, and would wear it? Cor. I would not. Lici. He's coming. [Going.] Mother! Cor. I have said, Licinia. [Licinia goes out. Yes; there's a point where virtue ought to stopâ Where she but loses labour. Ha! but is Her labour ever lost? I can't debate That question now; Nature won't let me. She's Too strong, and I must play the humble part She sets me. Had he not a wife and childâ He's here! [Retires. Enter Caius Gracchus, without seeing his Mother. Caius. I'll wrestle with him for, at least, This throw! My laws! What! abrogate my laws! Oh, insolence of tyranny! Well, well! We are not so weak as let him. Were he twice The consul, he shall not lay hands on them; Yea, though our bloodâ Cor. Caius, a word with you. There's Fulvius Flaccus waiting at the door With a whole crowd of citizens. Is't you, my son, They want? Caius. It is. Cor. I know it is! My son, Deal frankly with your mother. What's on foot? I do not like that Flaccus: he's a man Hath more ambition than integrity, And zeal than wisdom. Is he of your counsels? Caius. He is. Cor. The sooner then you break with him The better. Send him word you cannot come. Caius. My word 's already pledged to go with him To the Forum. Cor. On what errand, Caius Gracchus? Is it about your laws, they would annul? Mind, Caius, you're no longer tribune! Caius. Fear not; I shall be prudent. [Going. Cor. [Holding him.] Stop, Caius! [Taking his hand.] I can almost think you still The boy that conn'd his lessons at my knee, And I could rule in all his little moods With but a look.âAy, Caius; but a look Of your mother's made you calm as sunshine, in Your biggest storm! I would not lose you, Caius! Caius, I would not lose you! Go not to The Forum! Caius. Motherâis it you! Cor. Ay, son; It is your mother,âthat is all the mother Whate'er she seems. I would be still a mother! I would be left a son, my Caius!âGo not To the Forum! Caius. Wherefore, mother? What should I fear From going to the Forum? Cor. The Forum saw them shed your brother's blood! Do I not know you, Caius? Can I not read you, Without your tongue to help me? Does not his blood Cry for revenge; and is your ear unapt To hear it? Caius, that dear brother's death Gives life to all thy acts! 'Twas that which pleaded For Vettiusâask'd the tribuneshipârevived Tiberius's lawsâdefied the senateâmade thee Like a god to Rome, dealing out fateâand, now Thou art no longer arm'd with thy great office, Would lead thee forth to sacrifice! My son, Go not to the Forum! 'Tis a worthless cause! Why should you go, my Caius? To defend Your laws from abrogation? Think of them For whom you made those lawsâthe fickle people, That lent a hand to pull you from your seat, And raise up them, they shake at! Thou art single,â Thou hast no seconds. 'Tis a hopeless struggle! So sunk are all, the heart of public virtue Has not the blood to make it beat again. Caius. And should I therefore sink with the base times? What, mother, what? Are the gods also base? Is virtue base? Is honour sunk? Is manhood A thing contemptible, not fit to be Maintain'd? Remember you Messina, mother? Once from its promontory we beheld A galley in a storm; and, as the bark Approach'd the fatal shore, could well discern The features of the crew with horror all Aghast, save one. Alone he strove to guide The prow, erect amidst the horrid war Of winds and waters raging. With one hand He ruled the hopeless helm; the other strain'd The fragment of a shiver'd sail; his brow The while bent proudly on the scowling surge, At which he scowl'd again. The vessel struck! One man alone bestrode the wave, and rode The foaming courser safe.â'Twas he, the same! You clasp'd your Caius in your arms, and cried, âLook, look, my son! the brave man ne'er despairs, And lives where cowards die!â I would but make Due profit of your lesson. Cor. CaiusâCaius! Caius. MotherâIâ Cor. What, my son? Caius. [Sitting down.] I'll please you, mother; I'll not go to the Forum.âI'll be ruled by you If you will. Let men say what they list of me. I care not if they whisper as I pass, And point, and smile, and say to one another, âLo, the bold tribune, Gracchus! Lo, the man That lorded it o'er the senate!â What is't to me? I know I am your son, and would approve it If I might; but, since you will not have it so, I'll stay from the Forum, mother; I'll not go To the Forum. Cor. Know the people you did promise To go? Caius. Are they not here, with Fulvius Flaccus Expecting me? But let them go with him; He'll speak for them; he'll be their friend; he'll dare Oppose the senate; he'll preserve my laws, If he can. If there's no other man to speak For liberty, he'll do it! Pray you, mother, Send Lucius to them; tell them I'll not go Abroad to-day. Cor. You must go to the Forum! Caius. Not if you will it not. Cor. I neither will it, Nor will it not. Caius. Unless you bid me go, They go without me. Cor. Why, I think, as it is, You cannot help but go. I know not what's The matter. 'Tis, perhaps, the fears of thy wife, Infect me; but I've dark forebodings, Caius. What will be left me, should I lose thee, son? Caius. My monument! Cor. Go to the Forumâgo! You are Cornelia's son! Caius. My only use Of life 's to prove it! Cor. Goâgoâgo! my Caius! [Going, but turns and embraces her son.âThey go out severally. SCENE III. âA Square, with the Statue of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. Enter Caius Gracchus, Titus, Marcus, and Citizens. Caius. What son of Rome may not his country call To do her service? Romans, you desire I should defend your laws from abrogation, And I obey you. Tit. Caius! worthy Caius! Caius. Some coldness there has been between us; but We know the cause, and so are friends again. Our enemies may once prevail by craft, But not a second time. Now show yourselves The men you should be. If your liberties And rights are dear to you, be faithful to them. Fear not the senate; call upon the tribes; Be freemenânone will dare to make you slaves! Enter Flaccus. Fla. Caius, the consul is about to pass, Proceeding to the sacrifice, which he Has order'd, to give impious sanctity To his designs against you. Caius. Pray you, now, My friends, observe good order. Let them pass. [The Citizens retire. Music.âA Procession of Priests, &amp;c., followed by Opimius as Consul, attended by Drusus and Senators. Opi. [Seeing Gracchus.] What! Do you wait to interrupt us here,â You, Caius Gracchus, Fulvius, and the rest, With your lewd rabble? Caius. You may see, Opimius, The way is clear for you. Opi. Oh! is it so? 'Tis well, indeed, you give us leave to pass! You're very humble now, good Caius Gracchus! Drusus, is this the man that thought to ride The necks of the senators? This the lawgiver, That parcell'd out the lands of the patricians? Why, yes! 'Tis Caius Gracchus! Caius. True, Opimius; 'Tis even Caius Gracchus. Opi. How! so humble? What! This the gentleman that rail'd at us The other day with such a fearless tongue? Call'd us luxurious, proudâoppressorsâtyrants,â The common robbers of the state? This he? What knave may not grow honest! Speak your soul, man! Tell us you hate us,âspurn us, mock us, and Revile us, as you were wont to do! I hate The double villain. We are not the consul! These are not lictors! Gracchus does not fear To let us know his thoughts. Caius. I will not stay To give you plea of quarrel. Know, Opimius, The man that loves his country may respect The shadow of her greatness. [Goes out. Opi. Ha!âTake heed! Look to your safety! On to the sacrifice. [Music.âOpimius and his party go out. Fla. Is this to be endured? Could Caius brook it? I have no blood of his within my veins, And yet they boil! Mar. Had he but spoke the word, He should have been avenged. He rail'd at us,â Let's follow him! Tit. Hold, for the common cause! Mar. The common cause were served by any hurt That we could do Opimius. He's a tyrant! Fla. The worst of tyrants! Mar. Come, let's follow him, and rid our country of a tyrant! Tit. Stay! How are we prepared for such a thing? Remember, too, it is the time of sacrifice. Fla. Caius was tame to bear it. See! he returns, And chafing like a flood from its embankment New burst! Re-enter Caius Gracchus. Caius. Endure a life on sufferance Like this! Why, you must think me water, friends, Or something farther still removed from bloodâ If there's such poverty in natureâthat I seem to have no proper heat in me, To keep cool veins under the force of that Whose only sight, I see, sets yours a-boiling. Tit. Here comes his lictor with the entrails. Enter a Lictor, with the entrails. Lictor. Way, there, evil citizens! [Goes out. Tit. Down with him! 'Tis an evil word for him. Citizens. Down with him! [Titus and Citizens rush out. Caius. Hold! hold! Come back, my friendsâmy countrymen! You know notâ [A loud groan without. Re-enter Titus, with a bloody dagger. Tit. You are revenged! He's dead! Caius. Blood shed! Blood is not wash'd away except With blood! [The Citizens return slowly and sullenly. Why do you this? Why do you ever that You should not do? Who bade you take my quarrel Into your own hands? Who? I did not ask you For help or counsel. Gods! if I resolve To stake my life, may I not fix the game I throw't away on? Had I not here the tyrant Himself, within arm's reach,âthat but a stride Like this, had made my weapon and his heart Acquainted? Had I not? If I did think A gust of spleen, a fit of temper, a Sour stomach, was a thing to pitch against The cause,âhad I not man enough in me, Though thrice the number of his satellites Environ'd him, to smite him to my foot? And you must smite his slave! Now, look you, for That slave, the stones we tread on shall weep blood, And our veins lend the tears! Fla. Remember, 'twas For you they did it. Caius. Me? Oh! I retain The memory of all they have done for me! Fla. Observe their looks: they are depress'd and spiritless From your rebuke. It is not well to bring Their zeal to such an ebb. Caius. It is, indeed, The tide for ebbing. [Thunder.] Listen! Do you hear? Tit. The heavens lowerâ Caius. On us! There is something awful in their speech, More than the sound. [Thunder again.] That's anger! Enter Vettius, hastily. Vet. Disperse! disperse! The consul heavily Has ta'en his lictor's death. The senate is Convoked. [Louder thunder, the Citizens withdraw slowly. Caius. Now it speaks out. 'Tis not for naught They keep that stirring in the heavens. Some foot, On haste with wrath, hath from Jove's presence now Gone forth, the bearer of an errand, whose Dread import hath set all Olympus shaking! Fla. You are infusing fear into the crowd: This is no way to remedy the evil. Think what can best be done. Caius. Nothing is best, Where nothing can be done. Fla. Here comes your brother. Enter Licinius, hastily. Lic. A decree has pass'd the senate, that the consul Look to the public safety. Caius, you, And Fulvius Flaccus, are the men they aim at; You must protect yourselves! [Thunders still louder. Fla. Observe, the citizens fall off from us. Caius. Why, let them go! As long as our veins are full, Why should theirs flow? Let them fall off to oneâ To none! Their carrion would but poison Rome, And breed a mortal, general pestilence! Let them, I say! It shall be writ in blood, The man who labours for the people's good, The people shall give up to sacrifice! So shall their groans unpitied rend their breasts,â Unheeded, save of them whose ears confess No sweeter music! Here, even at the foot Of my great father's statue, I will brave The tyrant's wrath alone! [Kneels at his father's statue, hiding his face with his hands. Fla. What! hold your neck To the axe? Enter Pomponius, hastily. Pom. Caius, the consul's lictors, I'm advised, Are on the watch for you. Fla. Meet force with force! [The Citizens return in larger numbers. The people throng to you again. 'Twas but The storm dispersed them. Not for yourself, alone, Consent to draw the sword, but for your friends, As well, proscribed along with you; nor, yet, For them, but for your country, on whose neck The tyrant plants his foot! Art thou the man To let her lie there, when no arm but thine Can lift her thence? Look on the people!âSee! They stretch their hands to thee! A word, each hand Will grasp a weapon! The People. Caius! Caius. You prevail! Against myself, I pledge myself. O Rome! The sons do love thee most, must help thy foes To shed thy blood! To-morrow, friends! to-morrow! [They go out. SCENE IV. âAn Apartment in the House of Caius Gracchusâa couch. Enter Cornelia and Licinia, with a scroll, followed by Lucius, carrying lights. Cor. Will not you go to bed? Lici. Not till he comes. Cor. He must sup out. Lici. Well, I'll sit up for him. Cor. What, with those eyes, that look so ill prepared To play the watcher? Lici. I will read, Cornelia, And keep myself awake. I can't lie down; Go you to bed, my mother. Cor. I'll not give you Excuse for so uncall'd-for labour, by Partaking it. Good night! Lici. Good night! [Cornelia goes out, followed by Lucius. I wish He would come home! Why should he sup abroad To-night? Most like, it is my brother's fault: He never lets him rest with taking him To Carbo's houseâor Flaccus'âor some friends. I would Licinius had a wife himself, To keep him more at home. Cornelia 's right; I'm half-asleep already. A heavy lid Is strange companion to an anxious heart! Come, thou, that canst discourse without a tongue,â Cunning beguiler of the lonely! talk to me, And, for my dear lord, help me to keep watch! [She sits on the couch, and readsâgrows gradually drowsierâthe scroll falls from her hand, and she sleeps Enter Caius Gracchus, without seeing her. Caius. What meant the boy by starting when he let Me in? What's in my face to make him hold His breath, and change his colour at? I thought At first the house was not my own; never, yet, Felt it so like my own! A hundred objects, Day after day I've pass'd, with just as much Of consciousness as they had not been here, I now distinguish with a feeling of Such recognition, as invest them with The worth of things most precious.âWhat! Licinia! Asleep, too! She is sitting up for me! Come, now, Conspiracy, thou bold redresser Of grievances, doubly stak'st thy life! Thou wilt achieve beneath the peaceful brows Of household eaves, that never thought to see it, What were done better in the ruthless eyes Of frowning battlementsâand lead along The streets, where children, wives, and matrons tread, Mars' revels, fitter to be acted on Some far-removed, unfrequented waste,â Come, now! and, while the silken bands of sleep Hold thy unconscious, unoffending victim, Look on, and scan thy plea of conjuration, And see if it be proof! Thou canst not do it! Already is the ague creeping o'er Thy flesh, at longer trial of the test Would shake the weapon from thy hand, though clench'd With thousand oaths! That I should see her thus! Lici. [In her sleep.] Keep him in, mother! Let him not go forth! They'll kill my Caius! Caius. She is dreaming of me. Lici. [At first in her sleep, then awaking and rushing forward.] Oh, spare him! save him! give him to his wife! Strike hereâstrike here! [Caius catches her in his arms. My Caius!â'Twas a dream! But press me to thy heart; speak to me, Caius! I know 'tis you; but press meâspeak to me! Oh! 'twas a fearful dream! Cornelia. [Entering.] Who talks of dreams At such an hour of night? Go, sleep and dream! Lici. O, mother! such a dream!âAnd dreams are omens! Cor. Omens, or not; dreams have precursors, well As sequences! Your scarÃ©d thoughts to-day Were likely to give birth to pleasant dreams! I marvel that you had one! One may dream, Without the aid of sleep. You have been dreaming E'er since you rose this morning; and the spectre You saw with sealÃ©d lids, just now, be sure With open ones you started for yourself,â And more than once before! Caius was out All dayâbesieged with business that allow'd No breathing-time. Look at him!âHe's fatiguedâ Worn outâwants rest! A seasonable time To hold him, prating to him of a dream! To bed, my son; for you must rise, I know, Betimes. Licinia, if you love his health, Don't waste the hour that's due to needful sleep, And scant enough!âAway! Good night, Licinia! Caius, to bed at once.âMy son, good night! [Licinia and Caius go out. Good night, indeed! And is't my son whom, thus, I bid good night, without a hope to see The morning of his living face again? He's pledged!âHe has conspired! I took my measures To gather note of all. No other course Was left him. I'm content! Better my son Die in confronting, than in bowing to, The tyrant! But the chances?âThere's no chance! They'll fail him, as they fail'd Tiberius! Though vain the struggle, yet 'tis fit 'twere made, When bold injustice scoffs at laws, and 'gins To ride it, rough-shod, o'er them! What's my son? His noble name! that, scatheless, who shall dare To call me motherless? A mother once, Arming her son against his country's foes, Gave him his shield, with charge to bring it back, Or come back borne upon it. In my heart, I feel two mothers, struggling! Was it thus With her?âAnd, if it was, the nobler conquer'd; And shall the weaker rule in Scipio's daughter? My father answers, âNo!ââRome answers, âNo!â Cornelia, âNo!â Caius is dead, [Caius enters.] but not His name! His enemies may strike at that, But not a thousand blows could leave a scar! He sided with the weak and wrong'd,âresisted The wrongful and the strong,âin vain!âbut, when His country fell, he fell along with her! Caius. [Kneeling and catching Cornelia's hand.] My mother! Cor. [Bursting into a passion of tears.] Caius!âOh! my son! my son! [Curtain falls. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âThe Street before Caius's Houseâlamps at a distance. Citizens discovered lying asleep in various postures, armedâ others watching. Enter Titus. Tit. Almost the morning dawns. What! rouse ye, friends! Up, drowsy comrades, up! 'Tis timeâ'tis time! [They rise. Enter Caius Gracchus from the house. Caius. Ha! is it time, my friends? Tit. It is, good Caius. Caius. What noise of steps is that? Tit. A band of citizens, Crossing the end of the street. Caius. Go on before, my friends; I'll follow you. [Titus and Citizens go out. I will but take a last look of the house. To think of what I leave within that house! I left her sleeping. Gods! upon the brink Of what a precipice!âand she must down,â I cannot save her. As I stole away, She breathed my name, withal, so plaintively, It tax'd my manhood not to turn again! 'Tis done!âMy thought must look another way! TiberiusâI am coming! Art thou here, My brother, waiting for me? Yes, I feel Thou art! I am ready! Mighty shade, lead on! [Going. Enter Licinia, hastily. Lici. [Rushing towards him.] Caius!âOh! have I found you? Caius. My Licinia, Why do you quit your bed? Lici. To seek you, Caius. To bring you back with me! Come into the house. Caius. What fear you, love? Lici. I know not what I fear, But well I know that I have cause to fear! Your putting off your journey yesterdayâ Your going to the Forum, as you didâ Your making it so late ere you came backâ Your looks, I now recall, when you did come backâ Your rising now, at this unwonted hour,â A thousand thousand things that I could name, Had I the time to number them, forewarn me You go not forth for good! Caius. Licinia! wife! Collect yourself, and listen. Be content That I go forth, and may not be prevented. Why, what's the matter with you? Can't a man Get up a little hour or two, before His wonted time, and take a walk, but he Must run into a lion's mouth? For shame! If this were told of Caius' wife! Go in; Get thee to bed again; and take this kiss Along with thee. Lici. I cannot quit you, Caius,â I cannot let you go! Spite of myself, I cling to you as though it were a spell That bound my arms around you. I am ill, love; I'm very ill! in sooth, I am so ill, It is not kind of you to leave me, Caius. Caius, you would not leave me when I'm ill? You surely never would! Let me lean on you, And take me into the house. I thank you, Caius. Caius. [Conducting her to the door, and stopping.] There! Lici. Would you quit me at the threshold? Won't you Come in, too? Do come in!âYou will come in! You can go forth by-and-by. Caius. I must go forth At once, love. Lici. Must? In truth you must notâshall not! Caius. [Going.] Farewell! Lici. Stop, Caiusâstop! [Following him, catching hold of his robe, and discovering a sword under his arm.] Is it to use That sword you go abroad? Is it, my husband? It is!âI see it all! You would go forth To sell your life for an ungrateful people; To quit your wife and child for cowards who Look'd tamely on and saw your brother murder'd, And now will play the craven game with you. You trust the faith of men that have no faith Except when trial is not near. My Caius! My lord! my husband! father of my child! Go not, but hear your poor distracted wife! Caius. Licinia, now, is it perverse in you To fancy danger. I have business forth. Is it a time to walk the streets unarm'd, When drunken revellers from breaking up Of banquets are abroad? No more of this! Inâin! my love. Be sure I'll make all haste. Thy thin robe suits not, Sweet, the morning air. In, my Licinia, in! Dismiss your fears! [Trumpet without. Lici. What's that? [Trumpet again.] Again! Speaks not that summoner To thee? Caius. Dear wifeâ Lici. Come into the houseâcome in! If I'm thy wife, whose interest in thee Shall push by mine? Whose claim to hold thy pledge Calls on thee with a right that cancels mine? Thou shalt not go! [Trumpet. Caius. Liciniaâ Lici. Nay, thou shalt not! Caius. Let go my robe! Lici. I will not let it go! You hurt me, Caius!âKnow you, you do hurt me? For Juno's sake, dear husband! Caiusâoh! You gripe my wrist till I am sick with the pain!â If any one had told it! Promise one thing, And I will let thee go. Caius. What is it? Lici. Kill me! Caius. [Catching her to his breast.] Licinia! Lici. [Nearly fainting in his arms.] Ah! Caius. Gods! I have killed thee! Lici. No! Or, if you have, 'tis with a sudden draught Of too sweet life! Bless thee, my Caiusâbless thee! You will not goâyou'll stay with meâyou'll come with meâ You'll live for me! Come in! come in! come in! Enter Licinius. Lic. What keeps you, Caius? Caius. [Apart to him.] Take her from about My neck. Lici. I hear you, Caius! There! Myself Will do that kindness for thee. Thou art free To go. Stay, husband! Give me from about Thy neck that collar which thou wear'st, to keep it As thy last gift. Caius. Here, my Licinia. Lici. What! Nothing about me I can give thee in Exchange for't? Oh! I have a token yet, That hath the virtue of an amulet To him that values it. I have been told, Steel, at its sight, hath all as harmless turn'd As point of down, that cannot stand against The tender breath. Swear only, you will stay Until I fetch it. [She goes out hurriedly. Caius. Go!âI swear it, love! Lic. Now Caius, Now is your time! wait not till she returns. Caius. I have sworn to her. Lic. And if you swore to her To pluck an eye out, would you think it kinder To do't than leave't undone? Away, at once! The causeâthe cause! Re-enter Licinia, hastily, with her Child. Lici. Thy boy, my Caius! Caius. Ha! Lici. Nay, if thou look'st so cold upon thy child, I'm satisfied no hope remains for me! Caius. Now, was this kind? Lici. I do not know that word. It stands for nothingâworse! 'tis found the thing It says it is not! Husbands are call'd kind, That break the foolish hearts which treasure them; And fathers, who make orphans of their children! And brothers, who are worse than bloodless strangers! And friends, whose actions prove them deadliest foes! More kind are foes that don't pretend they're kind! [Kneels. Lic. Come, Caius! Caius, come! Caius. Why dost thou kneel? Lici. To beg the gods for mercy on my child, Since thou hast none for him, nor yet for me! [Trumpets without. Caius. Tear me away! More blessings light upon you Than I feel pangs, who curse the things I'd bless! [Caius Gracchus and Licinius go outâalarums continue. Enter Cornelia from the house, followed by Lucilla and Lucius. Cor. How's this? Licinia! Lici. Take the child from me, Until I lay me down and die. Cor. And die! Rise, rise, my daughter! Lici. Rather thou fall down Along with me, and pray the gods they send A thunderbolt to strike us both together! For both already they have smitten so, To spare is mocking mercy! Cor. Rise!âNay rise. [Lifts Licinia up. We may not tempt the gods! Come into the house, And show thy tears to itâ'twon't tell upon thee. This is the common street, and thou but lend'st The essence of thy grief to vilest tongues, Who will but jest at it. Come in! Come in! Lici. You counsel me, and do not know the cause Whereon you counsel me. Cor. My son is dead? Lici. No, no! Yetâ Cor. Yet! Why wouldst thou say he lives, And but that little word 'twixt him and death? He is the same as dead;âthen think him dead, As I do! Lici. And art thou a mother? Cor. Yes; The mother of the virtue of my child! The fashion of his body nature fix'd;â I had no choice in'tâwas not ask'd how high The stature on't should growâgave not my voice As to the shape of limb or lineament, Nor pick'd the shade and texture of the skin;â But, of his worth, the modelling was mine: Say, that is dead, and he and I are dead! Lici. I cannot answer this. I can but marvel, The weight which bows me down should seem so light To you. [Alarums without. Enter Livia, hurriedly. Livia. Cornelia! Cor. What's to fear, Livia. Livia. Those dreadful noises! Listenâyou will hear The rush of feet on every side. I've pass'd Such groups of angry-looking menâsome paleâ Some flush'dâsome mute, and others muttering To one anotherâhurrying all one way, As all on one momentous object bent. I came to thee, that we might seek some sanctuary; For houses are not safe in times like these. Cor. The Temple of Diana is at hand; We shall go thither. See, my Livia, How lost Licinia is! Take hold of her, And lead the way. Nobly, ye gods! oh, nobly! [They go out. SCENE II. âMount Aventine. Enter groups of armed Citizens, Caius Gracchus, Fulvius Flaccus, and Licinius. Caius. You seeâyou see! Their very trumpets shake Your ranks. How will they stand the blows of those Whose only breath can stagger? Lic. What! No truce? Fla. Twice have we offer'd terms of peace, which they Have twice refused, and into prison cast Our herald, my own son; and not content With this, they have proclaim'd reward to him Who brings your brother's head, its weight in gold! Caius. Then shall they have it at a dearer priceâ The safety of my friends! Enter Pomponius. Pom. Why stand you here? Advance! A rumour spreads among our ranks, That pardon is proclaim'd to those who quit us; And many friends fall off. Caius. It shall be so! Call back the runaways, and let them save The honour of their manhood! Husbands! drive out Your sad foreboding thoughts; your wives shall hear Your feet to-night upon the threshold. Sons! Check not your pious tears, but let them flow For joy; your mothers have not lost their props! Cowards! relax not your strain'd sinews yet, But live redoubted! Brave hearts! rein your courage, To give it course upon a fairer field: Caius alone shall bleed! Vet. What mean you, Caius? Caius. To yield myself into the consul's hands, And save these veins their stores! Vet. No, by the gods, You shall not do it! Caius. Not! Why should I live At such a price as half these lives, which I Can, singly dying, spare? I cannot live To give my country freedom: let me die To save her blood! Enter Vettius. Lic. What are your swords about? Sheathe them or use them. Caius. Friends, draw off our force; I'll meet them singly! Lic. Never! We'll live or die together! Or, take your course,â Yield yourself to the tyrant, if you will! My sword is out, and shall not quit my grasp, So long as it can strike a link away From the vile chains that gall us! Leave us, Caius,â Desert usâfly usâcarry with thee half Our strength! With the remaining half we'll struggle, Nor vilely live the thralls of tyranny! Caius. Oh, Rome, my country!âOh, my mother Rome! Is it to shed thy blood I use my sword? To fill thy matrons' and thy daughters' eyes With tears, and drain the spirits of thy sons? Should I not rather turn it 'gainst myself, And, by the timely sacrifice of one, Preserve the many? They will not let me do it; They take from me the rule of mine own acts, And make me Freedom's slave! What! is it so? Come, then, the only virtue that is left me,â The fatal virtue of necessity. Upon them! Give them stout hearts, ye gods! to enable them To stand the flashing of their tyrants' swords! Deaf to the din of battle let them be! Senseless to wounds, and without eyes for blood; That, for this once, they may belie themselves; Make tyranny to cower, and, from her yoke, Lift prostrate Liberty, to fall no more. [They go out. SCENE III. âThe Interior of the Temple of Dianaâthe Statue of the Goddessâa large Portal. Licinia, kneeling by the StatueâCornelia, Livia, Lucilla (with Gracchus's Child), Lucius, and numerous Females, who had fled for safety to the Temple, discovered. Cor. [To Lucius.] Go, boy; look out, and tell me what thou see'st. If all is quiet, run to the end of the street, But venture not beyondâand listen if Thou hear'st the sound of tumult. Use thy senses, And hurry back; and, mind, keep bounds. [Lucius goes out. Livia. [To one of the Females.] Observe Cornelia! Now what kind of soul is hers That in this hour of trembling can be calm, As nought but common things were passing round her? But note her! Cor. Livia, you did say just now, Your brother told you there had come a herald Proposing terms of peace. Livia. He did; but thought They would not be accepted. Cor. He thought right; No more they will. Opimius hath the gust Too strong for blood, when he hath snuff'd it, not To taste. He'll lap it: matters not whose veins 'Twill cost the emptying of, so they belong To honest men. Then will he offer sacrifice! Oh, man! man! man!âmost sacrilegious and Profane!âthat, with thy lips, dost laud the gods, Whose ordinance thou tearest with thy hands! The path to whom thou hast so thick beset With peril, he who seeks may find it out By many a grave which marks the spot, whereon The truly noble fell! Why clasp you me, My Livia? Livia. Do you hear the clash of swords? Cor. Indeed I do not. 'Tis your fancy, Livia. Livia. Nay, 'tis your talking of men's graves. Cor. Men's graves Are but men's beds; whereon we lay them, not For one hard day of toil to follow on Another! Thankless labour, Liviaâsweat, To him expends it profitlessâthat goes To nourish others, and they take, as though The using were a boon! How fares it with Licinia? Livia. All abstracted, as she were Alive to naught without her. I can draw No word nor sign from her. There kneels she to The statue of the goddess, mute as silence, And in so fix'd a stillness, you might ask, Which is the marble? A Soldier. [Without.] Way, there! Let me in! Cor. Open the gates, and let him in. Livia. Who is it? Cor. One is wounded from the fray. 'Tis going on! I fear that Lucius has gone nearer to it Than I commanded. Livia. And thou hast a son Is in it. Cor. Livia! Livia! I'm a mother Although I do not wail to let you know it! Re-enter Lucius. Now, sir, where have you been? Your face is flush'd; Finely you've mark'd my orders! Tell me what You've seen and heard? Luc. The battle is begun. Cor. I know it already. Can you tell which side Is like to win? Luc. The citizens, they say, Give ground. Livia. They do! Cor. I could have told it you, Without the aid of augury. How learn'd You this? Luc. From some that carried to his house The young Valerius, wounded mortally. Cor. That's right; you speak not out of breath, as though The house were on fire. Valerius, say you? Luc. Yes. I scarcely knew him as they bore him by, His face so gash'd. Livia. Oh! Cor. Hear you, sir! Now know Yourself a man! You have been nearer to The fray than you like to tell. You're a fine boy! What rush of feet is that? Go see. [Lucius goes out and returns. Luc. The citizens Fly every way; and from the windows and The houses' top, the women look and wring Their hands, and wail, and clamour. Listen! you Will hear them. Cor. I can hear them without ears. Caius Gracchus. [Without.] Shut to the gates! [Lucius goes out. Lici. [Starting up.] 'Tis Caius! Caius. [Without.] Thankless hearts! Not one presents himself to aid my sword, Or lend a charger to assist my flight; But as I were a racer in the games, They cry âMake haste!â and shout as I pass by! Enter Caius Gracchus. May they remain the abject things they are, Begging their daily pittance from the hands Of tyrant lords that spurn them! May they crawl Ever in bondage and in misery, And never know the blessÃ©d rights of freemen! Here will I perish! Lici. [Rushing to him.] Caius! Caius. My Licinia! My mother, too!âMy child, too! Enter Vettius. Vet. Caius here! Alas! my friend, you are lost! Pomponius and Licinius, striving to keep back the consul, And give you time for flight, have fallen beneath His hirelings' blows. They have the scent of you: Another minute, they're upon you! Cor. Caius, embrace me! The gods do bare no sword 'gainst virtue! Caius. No! My mother! My Licinia! give me my child. [Aside to Cornelia.] Mother, be you a parent to my wife, A tutor to my boy. The lessons you Did make me con, teach himânone else; he cannot Learn better. [Places the child in Cornelia's arms.] My Licinia, pardon me! [Embraces her.] Cor. She scarcely heeds thee! Son, what feel you for Beneath your cloak? Caius. Nothing, will hurt me, mother; But only balk our tyrants. Rome! O Rome! [A dagger drops from beneath Caius's robeâhe falls deadâLicinia, shrieking, throws herself on the body âCornelia, with difficulty, supports herselfâthe Consul and his troops are heard approachingâshe makes a violent effort to recover her self-possession. Enter Opimius and his party, with Guards, Lictors, &amp;c. Cornelia holds up the child in one hand, and with the other points to the body of CaiusâOpimius and the rest stand fixed in amazementâFlourish, and the curtain falls. END OF CAIUS GRACCHUS.</field>
