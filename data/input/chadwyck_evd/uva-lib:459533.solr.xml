      <field name="fulltext">Bussy D' Ambois: A TRAGEDIE:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. Not out of confidence that none but wee Are able to present this Tragedie, Nor out of envie at the grace of late It did receive, nor yet to derogate From their deserts, who give out boldly, that They move with equall feet on the same flat; Neither for all, nor any of such ends, Wee offer it, gracious and noble friends, To your review, wee farre from emulation (And charitably judge from imitation) With this work entertaine you, a peece knowne And still beleev'd in Court to be our owne, To quit our claime, doubting our right or merit, Would argue in us poverty of spirit Which we must not subscribe to: Field is gone Whose Action first did give it name, and one Who came the neerest to him, is denide By his gray beard to shew the height and pride Of D' Ambois youth and braverie; yet to hold Our title still a foot, and not grow cold By giving it o're, a third man with his best Of care and paines defends our interest; As Richard he was lik'd, nor doe wee feare, In personating D' Ambois, hee'le appeare To faint, or goe lesse, so your free consent As heretofore give him encouragement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primi Scena prima. Enter Bussy D' Ambois poore. Fortune, not Reason, rules the state of things, Reward goes backwards, Honor on his head; Who is not poore, is monstrous; only Need Gives forme and worth to every humane seed. As Cedars beaten with continuall stormes, So great men flourish; and doe imitate Unskilfull statuaries, who suppose (In forming a Colossus) if they make him Stroddle enough, stroot, and look bigg, and gape, Their work is goodly: so men meerely great (In their affected gravity of voice, Sowernesse of countenance, manners cruelty, Authority, wealth, and all the spawne of Fortune) Think they beare all the Kingdomes worth before them; Yet differ not from those Colossick Statues, Which with Heroique formes without o're-spread, Within are nought but morter, flint and lead. Man is a Torch borne in the winde; a Dreame But of a shadow, summ'd with all his substance; And as great Seamen using all their wealth And skills in Neptunes deepe invisible pathes, In tall ships richly built and ribd with brasse, To put a Girdle round about the world, When they have done it (comming neere their Haven) Are faine to give a warning peece, and call A poore staid fisher-man, that never past His Countries sight, to waft and guide them in: So when we wander furthest through the waves Of Glassie Glory and the Gulfes of State, Topt with all Titles, spreading all our reaches, As if each private Arme would sphere the earth, Wee must to vertue for her guide resort, Or wee shall shipwrack in our safest Port. Procumbit. Monsieur with two Pages. There is no second place in Numerous State That holds more than a Cypher: In a King All places are contain'd. His words and looks Are like the flashes and the bolts of Iove, His deeds inimitable, like the Sea That shuts still as it opes, and leaves no tracts, Nor prints of President for meane mens facts: There's but a Thred betwixt me and a Crowne; I would not wish it cut, unlesse by nature; Yet to prepare me for that possible Fortune, Tis good to get resolved spirits about mee. I follow'd D' Ambois to this greene Retreat; A man of spirit beyond the reach of feare, Who (discontent with his neglected worth) Neglects the light, and Ioves obscure Abodes; But hee is young and haughty, apt to take Fire at advancement, to beare state, and flourish; In his Rise therefore shall my bounties shine: None lothes the world so much, nor loves to scoffe it, But gold and grace will make him surfet of it, What, D' Ambois? Buss. He sir. Mons. Turn'd to Earth, alive? Up man, the Sunne shines on thee. Buss. Let it shine. I am no mote to play in't, as great men are. Mons. Callest thou men great in state, motes in the sunne? They say so that would have thee freeze in shades, That (like the grosse Sicilian Gurmundist) Empty their Noses in the Cates they love, That none may eat but they. Do thou but bring Light to the Banquet Fortune sets before thee And thou wilt loath leane Darknesse like thy Death. Who would beleeve thy mettall could let sloth Rust and consume it? If Themistocles Had liv'd obscur'd thus in th'Athenian state, Xerxes had made both him and it his slaves. If brave Camillus had lurckt so in Rome, He had not five times beene Dictator there, Nor foure times triumpht. If Epaminondas (Who liv'd twice twenty yeeres obscur'd in Thebs) Had liv'd so still, he had beene still unnam'd, And paid his Country nor himselfe their right: But putting forth his strength, he rescu'd both From imminent ruine; and like burnisht Steele, After long use he shin'd; for as the light Not only serves to shew, but render us Mutually profitable; so our lives In acts exemplarie, not only winne Our selves good Names, but doe to others give Matter for vertuous Deeds, by which wee live. Buss. What would you wish me? Mons. Leave the troubled streames, And live where Thrivers doe at the Well head. Buss. At the Well head? Alas what should I doe With that enchanted Glasse? See devils there? Or (like a strumpet) learne to set my looks In an eternall Brake, or practise jugling, To keepe my face still fast, my heart still loose; Or beare (like Dames Schoolmistresses their Riddles) Two Tongues, and be good only for a shift; Flatter great Lords, to put them still in minde Why they were made Lords: or please humorous Ladies With a good carriage, tell them idle Tales, To make their Physick work; spend a mans life In sights and visitations, that will make His eyes as hollow as his Mistresse heart: To doe none good, but those that have no need; To gaine being forward, though you break for haste All the Commandements ere you break your fast; But Beleeve backwards, make your Period And Creeds last Article, I beleeve in God: And (hearing villanies preacht) t'unfold their Art Learne to commit them, 'Tis a great mans Part. Shall I learne this there? Mons. No, thou needst not learne, Thou hast the Theorie, now goe there and practise. Buss. I, in a thrid-bare suit; when men come there, They must have high Naps, and goe from thence bare: A man may drowne the parts of ten rich men In one poore suit; Brave Barks, and outward Glosse Attract Court Loves, be in parts ne're so grosse. Mons. Thou shalt have Glosse enough, and all things fit T'enchase in all shew thy long smothered spirit: Be rul'd by me then. The old Scythians Painted blinde Fortunes powerfull hands with wings, To shew her gifts come swift and suddenly, Which if her Favorite be not swift to take, He loses them for ever. Then be wise: Exit Mons. Stay but a while here, and I'le send to thee. Manet Buss. Buss. What will he send? some Crowns? It is to sow them Upon my spirit, and make them spring a Crowne Worth Millions of the seed Crownes he will send. Like to disparking noble Husbandmen, Hee'll put his Plow into me, Plow me up: But his unsweating thrift is policie, And learning-hating policie is ignorant To fit his seed-land soyl; a smooth plain ground Will never nourish any politick seed; I am for honest Actions, not for great: If I may bring up a new fashion, And rise in Court for vertue; speed his plow: The King hath knowne me long as well as hee, Yet could my Fortune never fit the length Of both their understandings till this houre. There is a deepe nicke in times restlesse wheele For each mans good, when which nicke comes it strikes; As Rhetorick, yet workes not perswasion, But only is a meane to make it worke: So no man riseth by his reall merit, But when it cries Clincke in his Raisers spirit. Many will say, that cannot rise at all, Mans first houres rise is first step to his fall: I'le venture that; men that fall low must die, As well as men cast headlong from the skie. Ent. Maffe. Humor of Princes! Is this wretch indu'd With any merit worth a thousand Crownes? Will my Lord have me be so ill a Steward Of his Revenue, to dispose a summe So great with so small cause as shewes in him? I must examine this: Is your name D' Ambois? Buss. Sir. Maff. Is your name D' Ambois? Buss. Who have we here? Serve you the Monsieur? Maff. How? Buss. Serve you the Monsieur? Maff. Sir, y'are very hot. I doe serve the Monsieur; But in such place as gives me the Command Table Chesbord &amp; Tapers behind the Arras. Of all his other servants: And because His Graces pleasure is, to give your good His Passe through my Command, Me thinks you might Vse me with more respect. Buss. Crie you mercy. Now you have opened my dull eies, I see you; And would be glad to see the good you speake of: What might I call your name? Maff. Monsieur Maffe. Buss. Monsieur Maffe? Then good Monsieur Maffe, Pray let me know you better. Maff. Pray doe so, That you may use me better. For your selfe, By your no better outside, I would judge you To be some Poet; Have you given my Lord Some Pamphlet? Buss. Pamphlet? Maff. Pamphlet sir, I say. Buss. Did your great Masters goodnesse leave the good That is to passe your charge, to my poore use, To your discretion? Maff. Though he did not sir, I hope 'tis no rude office to aske reason. How that his Grace gives me in charge goes from me? Buss. That's very perfect sir. Maff. Why very good sir; I pray then give me leave: If for no Pamphlet, May I not know what other merit in you, Makes his compunction willing to relieve you? Buss. No merit in the world sir. Maff. That is strange. Y'are a poore souldier, are you? Buss. That I am sir. Maff. And have Commanded? Buss. I, and gone without sir. Maff. I see the man: A hundred Crownes will make him Swagger, and drinke healths to his Graces bountie; And sweare he could not be more bountifull: So there's nine hundred Crownes sav'd; here tall souldier, His grace hath sent you a whole hundred Crownes. Buss. A hundred sir? Nay doe his Highnesse right; I know his hand is larger, and perhaps I may deserve more than my outside shewes: I am a Poet, as I am a Souldier, And I can Poetise; and (being well encourag'd) May sing his fame for giving; yours for delivering (Like a most faithfull Steward) what he gives. Maff. What shall your subject be? Buss. I care not much, If to his bounteous Grace I sing the praise, Of faire great Noses, And to you of long ones. What Qualities have you sir (beside your chaine And velvet Jacket) Can your worship dance? Maff. A pleasant fellow faith: It seemes my Lord Will have him for his Jester; And berlady Such men are now no fooles, 'Tis a Knights place: If I (to save his Grace some Crounes) should urge him T'abate his Bountie, I should not be heard; I would to heaven I were an errant Asse, For then I should be sure to have the Eares Of these great men, where now their Jesters have them: Tis good to please him, yet Ile take no notice Of his preferment, but in policie Will still be grave and serious, lest he thinke I feare his woodden dagger: Here sir Ambo, D' Amb. How, Ambo sir? Maff. I is not your name Ambo? D' Amb. You call'd me lately D' Amboys, has your Worship So short a head? Maff. I cry thee mercy D' Amboys. A thousand Crownes I bring you from my Lord; If you be thriftie and play the good husband, you may make This a good standing living, 'Tis a Bountie, His Highnesse might perhaps have bestow'd better. D' Amb. Goe, y'are a Rascall; hence, Away you Rogue. Maff. What meane you sir? D' Amb. Hence; prate no more; Or by thy villans bloud thou prat'st thy last: A Barbarous Groome, grudge at his masters Bountie: But since I know he would as much abhorre His hinde should argue what he gives his friend, Take that Sir, for your aptnesse to dispute. Exit. Maff. These Crownes are set in bloud, bloud be the fruit. Exit. Henry, Guise, Montsurry, Elenor, Tamyra, Beaupre, Pero, Charlotte, Pyra, Annable. Henr. Duchesse of Guise, your Grace is much enricht, In the attendance of that English virgin, That will initiate her Prime of youth, (Dispos'd to Court conditions) under the hand Of your prefer'd instructions and Command, Rather than any in the English Court, Whose Ladies are not matcht in Christendome, For gracefull and confirm'd behaviours; More than the Court where they are bred is equall'd. Guis. I like not their Court-fashion, it is too crestfalne, In all observance; making Demi-gods Of their great Nobles; and of their old Queene An ever-yong, and most immortall Goddesse. Mont. No question shee's the rarest Queene in Europe. Guis. But what's that to her Immortality? Henr. Assure you Cosen Guise, so great a Courtier, So full of majestie and Roiall parts. No Queene in Christendome may vaunt her selfe, Her court approves it. That's a Court indeed; Not mixt with Clowneries us'd in common houses; But, as Courts should be th'abstracts of their kingdomes, In all the Beautie, State, and Worth they hold; So is hers, amplie, and by her inform'd. The world is not contracted in a man, With more proportion and expression, Than in her Court, her Kingdome: Our French Court Is a meere mirror of confusion to it: The King and subject, Lord and every slave, Dance a continuall Haie; Our Roomes of State, Kept like our stables; no place more observ'd Than a rude Market-place: and though our Custome Keepe this assur'd confusion from our eyes, 'Tis nere the lesse essentially unsightly, Which they would soone see, would they change their forme To this of ours, and then compare them both; Which we must not affect, because in Kingdomes, Where the Kings change doth breed the Subjects terror, Pure Innovation is more grosse than error. Mont. No Question we shall see them imitate (Though a farre off) the fashions of our Courts, As they have ever Ap't us in attire; Never were men so weary of their skins, And apt to leape out of themselves as they; Who when they travell to bring forth rare men, Come home delivered of a fiue French suit: Their Braines lie with their Tailors, and get babies For their most compleat issue; Hee's sole heire To all the morall vertues, that first greetes The light with a new fashion, which becomes them Like Apes, disfigur'd with the attires of men. Henr. No Question they much wrong their reall worth, In affectation of outlandish Scumme; But they have faults, and we more; They foolish-proud, To jet in others plumes so haughtely; We proud, that they are proud of foolerie, Holding our worthes more compleat for their vaunts. Enter Monsieur, D' Ambois. Mons. Come mine owne sweet heart I will enter thee. Sir, I have brought a Gentleman to court; And pray, you would vouchsafe to doe him grace. Henr. D' Ambois, I thinke. D' Amb. That's still my name, my Lord, though I be something altered in attire. Henr. We like your alteration, and must tell you, We have expected th'offer of your service; For we (in feare to make mild vertue proud) Vse not to seeke her out in any man. D' Amb. Nor doth she use to seeke out any man: They that will winne, must wooe her. Mons. I urg'd her modestie in him, my Lord, and gave her those Rites, that he sayes shee merits. Henr. If you have woo'd and won, then Brother weare him. Mons. Th'art mine, sweet heart; See here's the Guises Duches; The Countesse of Mountsurreaue. Beaupre; come I'le enfeame thee. Ladies, y'are too many to be in Counsell: I have here a friend, that I would gladly enter in your Graces. D' Amb. 'Save you Ladyes. Duch. If you enter him in our Graces, my Lord, me thinkes by his blunt behaviour, he should come out of himselfe. Tam. Has he never beene Courtier, my Lord? Mons. Never, my Lady. Beaup. And why did the Toy take him in th'head now? D' Amb. Tis leape yeare, Lady, and therefore very good to enter a Courtier, Henr. Marke Duchesse of Guise, there is one is not bashfull. Duch. No my Lord, he is much guilty of the bold extremity. Tam. The man's a Courtier at first sight. D' Amb. I can sing pricksong, Lady, at first sight; and why not be a Courtier as suddenly? Beaup. Here's a Courtier rotten before he be ripe. D' Amb. Thinke me not impudent, Lady, I am yet no Courtier, I desire to be one, and would gladly take entrance (Madam) under your Princely Colours. Enter Barrisor, L' Anon, Pyrlot. Duch. Soft sir, you must rise by degrees, first being the servant of some common Lady or Knights wife, then a little higher to a Lords wife; next a little higher to a Countesse; yet a little higher to a Duchesse, and then turne the ladder. D' Amb. Doe you alow a man then foure mistresses, when the greatest Mistresse is alowed but three servants? Duch. Where find you that statute sir? D' Amb. Why be judged by the Groome-porters. Duchesse. The Groome-porters? D' Amb. I Madam, must not they judge of all gamings i'th' Court? Duchesse. You talke like a gamester. Gui. Sir, know you me? D' Amb. My Lord? Gui. I know not you: Whom doe you serve? D' Amb. Serve, my Lord? Gui. Go to Companion; Your Courtship's too saucie. D' Amb. Saucie? Companion? Tis the Guise, but yet those termes might have beene spar'd of the Guiserd. Companion? He's jealous by this light: are you blind of that side Duke? Ile to her againe for that. Forth princely Mistresse, for the honour of Courtship. Another Riddle. Gui. Cease your Courtshippe, or by heaven Ile cut your throat. D' Amb. Cut my throat? cut a whetstone; young Accius NÅvius, doe as much with your tongue as he did with a Rasor; cut my throat? Bar. What new-come Gallant have wee heere, that dares mate the Guise thus? L' An. Sfoot this D' Ambois; The Duke mistakes him (on my life) for some Knight of the new edition. D' Amb. Cut my throat? I would the King fear'd thy cutting of his throat no more than I feare thy cutting of mine. Gui. Ile doe't by this hand. D' Amb. That hand dares not doe't; y'ave cut too many Throats already Guise, and robb'd the Realme of Many thousand Soules, more precious than thine owne. Come Madam, talk on; Sfoot, can you not talk? Talk on I say. Another Riddle. Pyr. Here's some strange distemper. Bar. Here's a sudden transmigration with D' Ambois, out of the Knights Ward, into the Dutches bed. L' An. See what a Metamorphosis a brave suit can work. Pyr. Slight step to the Guise and discover him. Bar. By no meanes, let the new suit work, wee'll see the issue. Gui. Leave your Courting. D' Amb. I will not. I say Mistresse, and I will stand unto it, that if a woman may have three servants, a man may have threescore Mistresses. Gui. Sirrha, Ile have you whipt out of the Court for this insolence. D' Amb. Whipt? Such another syllable out a th'presence, if thou dar'st for thy Dukedome. Gui. Remember, Poultron. Mons. Pray thee forbeare. Buss. Passion of death! Were not the King here, he should strow the Chamber like a rush. Mons. But leave Courting his wife then. Buss. I wil not: Ile Court her in despight of him. Not Court her! Come Madam, talk on; Feare me nothing: Well mai'st thou drive thy Master from the Court; but never D' Ambois. Mons. His great heart will not down, tis like the Sea That partly by his owne internall heat, Partly the starr's daily and nightly motion, Their heat and light, and partly of the place The divers frames, but chiefly by the Moone, Bristled with surges, never will be wonne, (No, not when th'hearts of all those powers are burst) To make retreat into his setled home, Till he be crown'd with his owne quiet some. Henr. You have the Mate. Another. Gui. No more. Flourish short. Exit Guise, after him the King, Mons. whispering. Bar. Why here's the Lion skar'd with the throat of a dunghill Cock; a fellow that has newly shak'd off his shackles; Now does he crow for that victory. L' An. Tis one of the best Jiggs that ever was acted. Pyr. Whom does the Guise suppose him to be troe? L' An. Out of doubt, some new denizond Lord; and thinks that suit newly drawne out a th' Mercers books. Bar. I have heard of a fellow, that by a fixt imagination looking upon a Bulbaiting, had a visible paire of hornes grew out of his forhead: and I beleeve this Gallant overjoyed with the conceit of Monsieurs cast suit, imagines himselfe to be the Monsieur. L' An. And why not? as well as the Asse, stalking in the Lions case, bare himselfe like a Lion, braying all the huger beasts out of the Forrest? Pyr. Peace, he looks this way. Bar. Marrie let him look sir; what will you say now if the Guise be gone to fetch a blanquet for him? L' An. Faith I beleeve it for his honour sake. Pyr. But, if D' Ambois carrie it cleane? Exeunt Ladies. Bar. True, when he curvets in the blanquet. Pyr. I marrie sir. L' An. Sfoot, see how he stares on's. Bar. Lord blesse us, let's away. Buss. Now sir, take your full view: how does the Object please ye? Bar. If you aske my opinion sir, I think your suit fits as well as if't had beene made for you. Buss. So sir, and was that the subject of your ridiculous joylity? L' An. What's that to you sir? Buss. Sir, I have observ'd all your fleerings; and resolve your selves yee shall give a strickt account for't. Enter Brisac, Melynell. Bar. O miraculous jealousie! Doe you think your selfe Such a singular subject for laughter, that none can fall into The matter of our merriment but you? L' An. This jealousie of yours sir, confesses some close defect in your selfe, that wee never dream'd of. Pyr. Wee held discourse of a perfum'd Asse, that being disguis'd in a Lions case, imagin'd himself a Lion: I hope that toucht not you. Buss. So sir: Your descants doe marvellous well fit this ground, we shall meet where your Buffonly laughters will cost ye the best blood in your bodies. Bar. For lifes sake let's be gone; hee'll kill's outright else. Buss. Goe at your pleasures, Ile be your Ghost to haunt you, and yee sleepe an't, hang me. L' An. Goe, goe sir, Court your Mistresse. Pyr. And be advis'd: we shall have odds against you. Buss. Tush, valour stands not in number: Ile maintaine it, that one man may beat three boyes, Bris. Nay, you shall have no ods of him in number sir: hee's a Gentleman as good as the proudest of you, and yee shall not wrong him. Bar. Not sir. Mely. Not sir: Though he be not so rich, hee's a better man than the best of you; And I will not endure it. L' An. Not you sir? Bris. No sir, nor I. Buss. I should thank you for this kindnesse, if I thought these perfum'd musk-Cats (being out of this priviledge) durst but once mew at us. Bar. Does your confident spirit doubt that sir? Follow us and try. L' An. Come sir, wee'll lead you a dance. Exeunt. Finis Actus primi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secund. Scena prima. Henry, Guise, Montsurry, and Attendants. Henry. This desperate quarrell sprung out of their envies To D' Ambois sudden bravery, and great spirit. Gui. Neither is worth their envie. Henr. Lesse than either Will make the Gall of Envie overflow; She feeds on outcast entrailes like a Kite: In which foule heape, if any ill lies hid, She sticks her beak into it, shakes it up, And hurl's it all abroad, that all may view it. Corruption is her Nutriment; but touch her With any precious oyntment, and you kill her: Where she finds any filth in men, she feasts, And with her black throat bruits it through the world; (Being sound and healthfull) But if she but taste The slenderest pittance of commended vertue, She surfets of it, and is like a flie, That passes all the bodies soundest parts, And dwels upon the sores; or if her squinteie Have power to find none there, she forges some: She makes that crooked ever which is strait; Call's Valour giddinesse, Iustice Tyrannie: A wise man may shun her, she not her selfe; Whither soever she flies from her Harmes, She beares her Foe still claspt in her own Armes: And therefore cousen Guise let us avoid her. Enter Nuncius. Nuncius. What Atlas or Olympus lifts his head So farre past Covert, that with aire enough My words may be inform'd? And from their height I may be seene, and heard through all the world? A tale so worthy, and so fraught with wonder, Sticks in my jawes, and labours with event. Henr. Com'st thou from D' Ambois? Nun. From him, and the rest His friends and enemies; whose sterne fight I saw, And heard their words before, and in the fray. Henr. Relate at large what thou hast seene and heard. Nun. I saw fierce D' Ambois, and his two brave friends. Enter the Field, and at their heeles their foes; Which were the famous souldiers, Barrisor, L' Anou, and Pyrrhot, great in deeds of Armes: All which arriv'd at the evenest peece of earth The field afforded; The three Challengers Turn'd head, drew all their rapiers, and stood ranckt: When face to face the three Defendants met them, Alike prepar'd, and resolute alike, Like bonfires of Contributorie wood, Every mans look shew'd, Fed with eithers spirit, As one had beene a mirror to another, Like formes of life and death each took from other; And so were life and death mixt at their heights, That you could see no feare of death, for life; Nor love of life, for death: But in their browes Pyrrho's Opinion in great letters shone; That life and death in all respects are one. Henr. Past there no sort of words at their encounter? Nun. As Hector, twixt the Hosts of Greece and Troy, (When Parts and the Spartane King should end The nine yeares warre) held up his brasen launce For signall, that both Hosts should cease from Armes, And heare him speak: So Barrisor (advis'd) Advanc'd his naked Rapier twixt both sides, Ript up the Quarrell, and compar'd six lives, Then laid in ballance with six idle words, Offer'd remission and contrition too; Or else that he and D' Ambois might conclude The others dangers. D' Ambois lik'd the last; But Barrisors friends (being equally engag'd In the maine Quarrell) never would expose His life alone, to that they all deserv'd. And (for the other offer of remission) D' Ambois (that like a Lawrell put in fire, Spakl'd and spit) did much much more than scorne, That his wrong should incense him so like chaffe, To goe so soone out; and like lighted paper, Approve his spirit at once both fire and ashes: So drew they lots, and in them Fates appointed, That Barrisor should fight with firie D' Ambois; Pyrhot with Melynell; with Brisac L' Anou: And then like flame and Powder they commixt, So spritely, that I wisht they had beene spirits, That the ne're shutting wounds, they needs must open, Might as they open'd, shut, and never kill: But D' Ambois sword (that lightned as it flew) Shot like a pointed Comet at the face Of manly Barrisor; and there it stucke: Thrice pluckt he at it, and thrice drew on thrusts, From him, that of himselfe was free as fire; Who thrust still as he pluckt, yet (past beliefe!) He with his subtile eye, hand, body, scap't; At last the deadly bitten point tugg'd off, On fell his yet undaunted Foe so fiercely, That (only made more horrid with his wound) Great D' Ambois shrunke, and gave a little ground; But soone return'd, redoubled in his danger, And at the heart of Barrisor seal'd his anger: Then, as in Arden I have seene an Oke Long shooke with tempests, and his loftie toppe Bent to his root, which being at length made loose (Even groaning with his weight) he gan to Nodde This way and that: as loth his curled Browes (Which he had oft wrapt in the skie with stormes) Should stoope: and yet, his radicall fivers burst, Storme-like he fell, and hid the feare cold Earth. So fell stout Barrisor, that had stood the shocks Of ten set Battels in your Highnesse warre, 'Gainst the sole souldier of the world, Navarre. Gui. O pitious and horrid murther! Beau. Such a life Me thinks had mettall in it to survive An age of men. Henr. Such, often soonest end. Thy felt report cals on, we long to know On what events the other have arriv'd. Nun. Sorrow and fury, like two opposite fumes, Met in the upper Region of a Cloud, At the report made by this Worthies fall, Brake from the earth, and with them rose Revenge, Entring with fresh powers his two noble friends; And under that ods fell surcharg'd Brisac, The friend of D' Ambois, before fierce L' Anou; Which D' Ambois seeing, as I once did see In my young travels through Armenia, An angrie Vnicorne in his full cariere Charge with too swift a foot a Jeweller, That watcht him for the Treasure of his brow; And ere he could get shelter of a tree, Naile him with his rich Antler to the Earth: So D' Ambois ranne upon reveng'd L' Anou, Who eying th'eager point borne in his face, And giving backe, fell back, and in his fall His foes uncurbed sword stopt in his heart: By which time all the life strings of th'tw'other Were cut, and both fell as their spirit flew Vpwards: and still hunt Honour at the view. And now (of all the six) sole D' Ambois stood Vntoucht, save only with the others bloud. Henr. All slaine outright but hee? Nun. All slaine outright but he, Who kneeling in the warme life of his friends, (All freckled with the bloud his Rapier raind) He kist their pale lips, and bade both farewell; And see the bravest man the French earth beares. Enter Monsieur, D' Amb. bare. Buss. Now is the time, y'are Princely vow'd my friend, Performe it Princely, and obtaine my pardon. Mons. Else Heaven forgive not me: Come on brave friend. If ever Nature held her selfe her owne, When the great Triall of a King and subject Met in one bloud, both from one belly springing: Now prove her vertue and her greatnesse One, Or make the t'one the greater with the t'other, (As true Kings should) and for your brothers love, (Which is a speciall species of true vertue) Doe that you could not doe, not being a King. Henr. Brother I know your suit; these wilfull murthers Are ever past our pardon. Mons. Manly slaughter Should never beare th'account of wilfull murther; It being a spice of justice, where with life Offending past law, equall life is laid In equall ballance, to scourge that offence By law of reputation, which to men Exceeds all positive law; and what that leaves To true mens valours (not prefixing rights Of satisfaction, suited to their wrongs) A free mans eminence may supply and take. Henr. This would make every man that thinks him wrong'd, Or is offended, or in wrong or right, Lay on this violence, and all vaunt themselves, Law-menders and supplyers though meere Butchers; Should this fact (though of justice) be forgiven? Mons. O no, my Lord; it would make Cowards feare To touch the reputations of true men, When only they are left to impe the law, Justice will soone distinguish murtherous minds From just revengers: Had my friend beene slaine, (His enemy surviving) he should die, Since he had added to a murther'd fame (Which was in his intent) a murthered man; And this had worthily beene wilfull murther: But my friend only sav'd his fames deare life, Which is above life, taking th'under value, Which in the wrong it did was forfeit to him; And in this fact only preserves a man In his uprightnesse; worthy to survive Millions of such as murther men alive. Henr. Well brother, rise, and raise your friend withall From death to life: and D' Ambois, let your life (Refin'd by passing through this merited death) Be purg'd from more such foule pollution; Nor on your scape, nor valour more presuming, To be againe so daring. Buss. My Lord, I lothe as much a deed of unjust death, As law it selfe doth; and to Tyrannise, Because I have a little spirit to dare. And power to doe, as to be Tyranniz'd; This is a grace that (on my knees redoubled) I crave to double this my short lifes gilt, And shall your royall bountie Centuple, That I may so make good what law and nature Have given me for my good: since I am free, (Offending no Just law) let no law make By any wrong it does, my life her slave: When I am wrong'd and that law failes to right me, Let me be King my selfe (as man was made) And doe a justice that exceeds the law: If my wrong passe the power of single valour To right and expiate; then be you my King, And doe a Right, exceeding Law and Nature: Who to himselfe is law, no law doth need, Offends no Law, and is a King indeed. Henr. Enjoy what thou intreat'st, we give but ours. Exit Rex cum Beau. Buss. What you have given, my Lord, is ever yours. Gui. Who would have pardon'd such a murther? Exit. Mons. Now vanish horrors into Court attractions, For which let this balme make thee fresh and faire. And now forth with thy service to the Duchesse, As my long love will to Montsurries Countesse. Exit. D' Amb. To whom my love hath long been vow'd in heart, Although in hand for shew I held the Duchesse. And now through bloud and vengeance, deeds of height, And hard to be atchiev'd, tis fit I make Attempt of her perfection, I need feare No check in his Rivality, since her vertues Are so renown'd, and hee of all Dames hated. Exit. Enter Monsieur, Tamyra, and Pero with a Booke. Mons. Pray thee regard thine owne good, if not mine, And cheere my Love for that; you doe not know What you may be by me, nor what without me; I may have power t'advance and pull downe any. Tamy. That's not my study. One way I am sure You shall not pull downe me; my husbands height Is crowne to all my hopes, and his retiring To any meane state, shall be my aspiring: Mine honour's in mine owne hands, spite of kings. Mons. Honour, what's that? your second maydenhead: And what is that? a word; the word is gone, The thing remaines; the Rose is pluckt, the stalk Abides: an easie losse where no lack's found. Beleeve it, there's as small lack in the losse, As there is paine ith' losing: Archers ever Have two strings to a bow, and shall great Cupid (Archer of Archers both in men and women) Be worse provided than a common Archer? A Husband and a Friend all wise Wives have. Tamy. Wise wives they are that on such strings depend, With a firme husband joyning a lose friend. Mons. Still you stand on your husband, so doe all The common sex of you, when y'are encounter'd With one ye cannot fancie: all men know You live in Court here by your owne election, Frequenting all our common sports and triumphs, All the most youthfull company of men: And wherefore doe you this? To please your husband? Tis grosse and fulsome: if your husbands pleasure Be all your Object, and you ayme at Honour, In living close to him, Get you from Court, You may have him at home; these common Put-ofs For common women serve: my honour? husband? Dames maritorious, ne're were meritorious: Speak plaine, and say I doe not like you Sir, Y'are an ill-favour'd fellow in my eye And I am answer'd. Tamy. Then I pray be answer'd: For in good faith my Lord I doe not like you In that sort you like. Mons. Then have at you here: Take (with a politique hand) this rope of Pearle; And though you be not amorous, yet be wise: Take me for wisedom; he that you can love Is nere the further from you. Tamy. Now it comes So ill prepar'd, that I may take a poyson Under a medicine as good cheap as it: I will not have it were it worth the world. Mons. Horror of death: could I but please your eye, You would give me the like, ere you would loose me: Honor and husband? Tamy. By this light my Lord Y'are a vile fellow: and Ile tell the King Your occupation of dishonouring Ladies And of his Court: a Lady cannot live As she was borne, and with that sort of pleasure That fits her state, but she must be defam'd With an infamous Lords detraction: Who would endure the Court if these attempts, Of open and profest lust must be borne? Whose there? come on Dame, you are at your book When men are at your Mistresse; have I taught you Any such waiting womans quality? Mons. Farewell good husband. Exit Mons. Tamira. Farewell wicked Lord. Enter Mont. Mont. Was not the Monsieur here? Tam. Yes, to good purpose. And your cause is as good to seek him too, And haunt his company. Mont. Why, what's the matter? Tam. Matter of death, were I some husbands wife: I cannot live at quiet in my chamber For oportunities almost to rapes Offerd me by him. Mont. Pray thee beare with him: Thou know'n he is a Bachelor, and a Courtier, I, and a Prince: and their prerogatives Are, to their lawes, as to their pardons are Their reservations, after Parliaments, One quits another: forme gives all their essence: That Prince doth high in vertues reckoning stand That will entreat a vice, and not command: So farre beare with him: should another man Trust to his priviledge, he should trust to death: Take comfort then (my comfort) nay triumph, And crown thy selfe, thou part'st with victory: My presence is so onely deare to thee, That other mens appeare worse than they be. For this night yet, beare with my forced absence: Thou know'st my businesse; and with how much weight, My vow hath charged it. Tam. True my Lord, and never My fruitlesse love shall let your serious honour, Yet, sweet Lord, do not stay, you know my soule Is so long time without me, and I dead As you are absent. Mont. By this kisse, receive My soule for hostage, till I see my love. Tam. The morne shall let me see you. Mont. With the sunne Ile visit thy more comfortable beauties. Tam. This is my comfort, that the sunne hath left The whole worlds beauty ere my sunne leaves me. Mont. Tis late night now indeed: farewell my light. Exit. Tam. Farewell my light and life: But not in him, In mine owne dark love and light bent to another. Alas, that in the wave of our affections We should supply it with a full dissembling, In which each youngest Maid is grown a Mother, Frailty is fruitfull, one sinne gets another: Our loves like sparkles are that brightest shine, When they goe out; most vice shewes most divine: Goe Maid, to bed, lend me your book I pray: Not like your selfe, for forme, Ile this night trouble None of your services: Make sure the dores; And call your other fellowes to their rest. Per. I will, yet I will watch to know why you watch. Exit. Tam. Now all yee peacefull regents of the night, Silently-gliding exhalations, Languishing windes, and murmuring falls of waters, Sadnesse of heart, and ominous securenesse, Enchantments, dead sleepes, all the friends of rest, That ever wrought upon the life of man; Extend your utmost strengths; and this charm'd houre Fix like the Center: make the violent wheeles Of Time and Fortune stand; and Great Existens (The Makers treasurie) now not seeme to be, To all but my approaching friends and me: They come, alas they come, feare, feare and hope Of one thing, at one instant fight in me: I love what most I loath, and cannot live Unlesse I compasse that which holds my death: For lifes meere death loving one that loathes me, And he I love, will loath me, when he sees The Vault opens. I flie my sex, my vertue, my Renowne, To runne so madly on a man unknowne. See, see a Vault is opening that was never Knowne to my Lord and husband, nor to any But him that brings the man I love, and me; How shall I looke on him? how shall I live And not consume in blushes, I will in; And cast my selfe off, as I ne're had beene. Exit. Ascendit Frier and D' Ambois. Frier. Come worthiest sonne, I am past measure glad, That you (whose worth I have approv'd so long) Should be the Object of her fearefull love; Since both your wit and spirit can adapt Their full force to supply her utmost weaknesse: You know her worths and vertues, for Report Of all that know, is to a man a knowledge: You know besides, that our affections storme, Rais'd in our blood, no Reason can reforme. Though she seeke then their satisfaction, (Which she must needs, or rest unsatisfied) Your judgement will esteeme her peace thus wrought, Nothing lesse deare, than if your selfe had sought: And (with another colour, which my Art Shall teach you to lay on) your selfe must seeme The onely agent, and the first Orbe Move, In this our set, and cunning world of Love. Buss. Give me the colour (my most honour'd Father) And trust my cunning then to lay it on. Frier. Tis this, good sonne; Lord Barrisor (whom you slew) Did love her dearely, and with all fit meanes Hath urg'd his acceptation, of all which Shee keepes one letter written in his blood: You must say thus then, That you heard from mee How much her selfe was toucht in conscience With a Report (which is in truth disperst) That your maine quarrell grew about her love, Lord Barrisor imagining your Courtship Of the great Guises Duchesse in the Presence, Was by you made to his elected Mistresse; And so made me your meane now to resolve her, Chosing (by my direction) this nights depth, For the more cleare avoiding of all note Of your presumed presence, and with this (To cleare her hands of such a Lovers blood) She will so kindly thank and entertaine you, (Me thinks I see how) I, and ten to one, Shew you the confirmation in his blood, Lest you should think report, and she did faine, That you shall so have circumstantiall meanes, To come to the direct, which must be used: For the direct is crooked; Love comes flying; The height of love is still wonne with denying. D' Amb. Thanks honoured Father. Frier. Shee must never know That you know any thing of any love Sustain'd on her part: For learne this of me; In any thing a woman does alone, If she dissemble, she thinks tis not done; If not dissemble, nor a little chide, Give her her wish, she is not satisfi'd; To have a man think that she never seekes, Does her more good than to have all she likes: This frailty sticks in them beyond their sex; Which to reforme, reason is too perplex: Urge reason to them, it will doe no good; Humour (that is the charriot of our food In every body) must in them be fed, To carrie their affections by it bred. Stand close. Enter Tamyra with a Book. Tam. Alas, I feare my strangenesse will retire him: If he goe back, I die; I must prevent it, And cheare his onset with my sight at least, And that's the most; though every step he takes. Goes to my heart, Ile rather die than seeme Not to be strange to that I most esteeme. Frier. Madam. Tamy. Ah! Frier. You will pardon me, I hope, That, so beyond your expectation, (And at a time for visitants so unfit) I (with my noble friend here) visit you: You know that my accesse at any time Hath ever beene admitted; and that friend That my care will presume to bring with me, Shall have all circumstance of worth in him, To merit as free welcome as my selfe. Tamy. O Father, but at this suspicious houre You know how apt best men are to suspect us, In any cause, that makes suspicious shadow No greater than the shadow of a haire: And y'are to blame: what though my Lord and husband Lie forth to night? and since I cannot sleepe When he is absent, I sit up to night, Though all the dores are sure, and all our servants As sure bound with their sleepes; yet there is one That wakes above, whose eye no sleepe can binde: He sees through dores, and darknesse, and our thoughts; And therefore as we should avoid with feare, To think amisse our selves before his search; So should we be as curious to shunne All cause that other think not ill of us. D' Amb. Madam, 'tis farre from that: I only heard By this my honour'd Father, that your conscience Made some deepe scruple with a false report; That Barrisors blood should something touch your honour, Since he imagin'd I was courting you, When I was bold to change words with the Duchesse, And therefore made his quarrell, his long love And service, as I heare, being deepely vowed To your perfections, which my ready presence Presum'd on with my Father at this season, For the more care of your so curious honour, Can well resolve your Conscience, is most false. Tam. And is it therefore that you come good sir? Then crave I now your pardon and my Fathers, And sweare your presence does me so much good, That all I have it bindes to your requitall: Indeed sir, 'tis most true that a report Is spread, alleadging that his love to me Was reason of your quarrell, and because You shall not think I faine it for my glory, That he importun'd me for his Court service, I'le shew you his own hand, set down in blood To that vaine purpose: Good Sir, then come in. Exit Tamira and D' Amb, Father I thank you now a thousand fold. Fryar. May it be worth it to you honour'd daughter. Descendit Fryar. Finis Actus secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertij Scena Prima. Enter D' Ambois, Tamyra, with a Chaine of Pearle. D' Amb. Sweet Mistresse cease, your conference is too nice, And bites too hotly of the Puritanespice. Tam. O my deare servant, in thy close embraces, I have set open all the dores of danger To my encompast honour, and my life: Before I was secure against death and hell; But now am subject to the heartlesse feare, Of every shadow, and of every breath, And would change firmnesse with an aspen leafe: So confident a spotlesse conscience is; So weake a guilty: O the dangerous siege Sinne layes about us? and the tyrannie He exercises when he hath expugn'd: Like to the horror of a Winters thunder, Mixt with a gushing storme, that suffer nothing To stirre abroad on earth, but their own rages, Is sinne, when it hath gathered head above us, No roofe, no shelter can secure us so, But he will drowne our cheeks in feare or woe. D' Ambois. Sin is a coward Madam, and insults But on our weaknesse, in his truest valour: And so our ignorance tames us, that we let His shadowes fright us: and like empty clouds In which our faulty apprehensions forge The formes of Dragons, Lions, Elephants, When they hold no proportion: the slie charmes Of the witch policy makes him, like a Monster Kept onely to shew men for Servile money: That false hagge often paints him in her cloth Ten times more monstrous than he is in troth: In three of us, the secret of our meeting, Is onely guarded, and three friends as one Have ever beene esteem'd: as our three powers That in one soule, are, as one united: Why should we feare then? for my selfe I sweare Sooner shall torture be the Sire to pleasure, And health be grievous to one long time sick, Than the deare jewell of your fame in me, Be made an out-cast to your infamy; Nor shall my value (sacred to your vertues) Onely give free course to it, from my selfe: But make it flie out of the mouths of Kings In golden vapours, and with awfull wings. Tam. It rests as all Kings seales were set in thee. Now let us call my Father, whom I sweare I could extreamly chide, but that I feare To make him so suspicious of my love Of which (sweet servant) doe not let him know For all the world. D' Amb. Alas! he will not think it? Tam. Come thenâho? Father, ope, and take your friend. Ascendit Frier. Frier. Now honour'd daughter, is your doubt resolv'd. Tam. I Father, but you went away too sonne. Fryer. Too soone? Tam. Indeed you did, you should have stayed; Had not your worthy friend beene of your bringing, And that containes all lawes to temper me, Not all the fearefull danger that besieged us, Had aw'd my throat from exclamation. Fryer. I know your serious disposition well. Come sonne the morne comes on. D' Amb. Now honour'd Mistresse Till farther service call, all blisse supply you. Tamy. And you this chaine of pearle, and my love onely. It is not I, but urgent destiny, Descendit Frier and D' Amb. That (as great States-men for their generall end In politique justice, make poore men offend) Enforceth my offence to make it just: What shall weak Dames doe, when th'whole work of Nature Hath a strong finger in each one of us? Needs must that sweep away the silly cobweb Of our still-undone labours; that layes still Our powers to it: as to the line, the stone, Not to the stone, the line should be oppos'd. We cannot keepe our constant course in vertue: What is alike at all parts? every day Differs from other: every houre and minute: I, every thought in our false clock of life, Oft times inverts the whole circumference: We must be sometimes one, sometimes another: Our bodies are but thick clouds to our soules; Through which they cannot shine when they desire: When all the starres, and even the sunne himselfe, Must stay the vapours times that he exhales Before he can make good his beames to us: O how can we, that are but motes to him, Wandring at randon in his ordered rayes, Disperse our passions fumes, with our weak labours, That are more thick and black than all earths vapours? Enter Mont. Mon. Good day, my love: what up and ready too! Tam. Both, (my deare Lord) not all this night made I My selfe unready, or could sleep a wink. Mont. Alas, what troubled my true Love? my peace, From being at peace within her better selfe? Or how could sleepe forbeare to seize thine eyes When he might challenge them as his just prise? Tam. I am in no powre earthly, but in yours; To what end should I goe to bed my Lord, That wholly mist the comfort of my bed? Or how should sleepe possesse my faculties, Wanting the proper closer of mine eyes? Mont. Then will I never more sleepe night from thee: All mine owne Businesse, all the Kings affaires, Shall take the day to serve them: Every night Ile ever dedicate to thy delights. Tam. Nay, good my Lord esteeme not my desires Such doters on their humours, that my judgement Cannot subdue them to your worthier pleasure: A wives pleas'd husband must her object be In all her acts, not her sooth'd fantasie. Mont. Then come my Love, Now pay those Rites to sleepe Thy faire eyes owe him: shall we now to bed? Tam. O no my Lord, your holy Frier sayes, All couplings in the day that touch the bed, Adulterous are, even in the married; Whose grave and worthy doctrine, well I know, Your faith in him will liberally allow. Mont. Hee's a most learned and Religious man: Come to the Presence then, and see great D' Ambois (Fortunes proud mushrome shot up in a night) Stand like an Atlas under our Kings arme; Which greatnesse with him Monsieur now envies As bitterly and deadly as the Guise. Tam. What, he that was but yesterday his maker? His raiser and preserver? Mont. Even the same. Each naturall agent works but to this end, To render that it works on, like it selfe; Which since the Monsieur in his act on D' Ambois, Cannot to his ambitious end effect, But that (quite opposite) the King hath power (In his love borne to D' Ambois) to convert The point of Monsieurs aime on his owne breast, He turnes his outward love to inward hate: A Princes love is like the lightnings fume, Which no man can embrace, but must consume. Exeunt. Henry, D' Ambois, Monsieur, Guise, Dutches Annabell, Charlot, Attendants. Henr. Speak home Bussy, thy impartiall words Are like brave Faulcons that dare trusse a Fowle Much greater than themselves; Flatterers are Kites That check at Sparrowes; thou shalt be my Eagle, And beare my thunder underneath thy wings: Truths words like jewels hang in th'eares of Kings. Buss. Would I might live to see no Jewes hang there In steed of jewels; sycophants I meane, Who use truth like the Devill, his true Foe, Cast by the Angell to the pit of feares, And bound in chaines; truth seldome decks Kings eares: Slave flattery (like a Rippiers legs rowl'd up In boots of hay-ropes) with Kings soothed guts Swadled and strappl'd, now lives onely free. O tis a subtle knave; how like the plague Unfelt, he strikes into the braine of man, And rageth in his entrailes when he can, Worse than the poison of a red hair'd man? Henr. Fly at him and his brood, I cast thee off, And once more give thee surname of mine Eagle. Buss. Ile make you sport enough then, let me have My lucerns too, (or dogs inur'd to hunt Beasts of most rapine) but to put them up, And if I trusse not, let me not be trusted: Shew me a great man (by the peoples voice, Which is the voice of God) that by his greatnesse Bumbasts his private roofes, with publique riches; That affects royaltie, rising from a clapdish; That rules so much more by his suffering King, That he makes Kings of his subordinate slaves: Himselfe and them graduate like woodmongers (Piling a stack of billets) from the earth, Raising each other into steeples heights; Let him convey this on the turning props Of Protean Law, and (his owne counsell keeping) Keepe all upright; let me but hawlk at him, Ile play the Vulture, and so thump his liver, That (like a huge unlading Argosea) He shall confesse all, and you then may hang him. Shew me a Clergie man, that is in voice A Lark of Heaven, in heart a Mowle of earth; That hath good living, and a wicked life; A temperate look, and a luxurious gut; Turning the rents of his superfluous Cures Into your Phesants and your Partriches; Venting their Quintessence as men read Hebrew: Let me but hawlk at him, and, like the other, He shall confesse all, and you then may hang him. Shew me a Lawyer that turnes sacred law (The equall rendrer of each man his owne, The scourge of Rapine and Extortion, The Sanctuary and impregnable defence Of retir'd learning, and besieged vertue) Into a Harpy, that eates all but's owne, Into the damned sinnes it punisheth; Into the Synagogue of theeves and Atheists; Blood into gold, and justice into lust: Let me but hawlk at him, as at the rest, He shall confesse all, and you then may hang him. Enter Mont-Surrey, Tamira, and Pero. Gui. Where will you find such game as you would hawlk at? Buss. Ile hawlk about your house for one of them. Gui. Come, y'are a glorious Ruffin, and runne proud Of the Kings headlong graces; hold your breath, Or by that poyson'd vapour not the King Shall back your murtherous valour against me. Buss. I would the King would make his presence free But for one bout betwixt us: By the reverence Due to the sacred space twixt kings and subjects, Here would I make thee cast that popular purple, In which thy proud soule sits and braves thy soveraigne. Mons. Peace, peace, I pray thee peace. Buss. Let him peace first that made the first warre. Mons. He's the better man. Buss. And therefore may doe worst? Mons. He has more titles. Buss. So Hydra had more heads. Mons. He's greater knowne. Buss. His greatnesse is the peoples, mine's mine owne. Mons. He's nobly borne. Buss. He is not, I am noble. And noblesse in his blood hath no gradation, But in his merit, Gui. Th'art not nobly borne, But bastard to the Cardinall of Ambois. Buss. Thou liest proud Guiserd; let me flie (my Lord.) Henr. Not in my face; (my Eagle) violence flies The Sanctuaries of a Princes eyes. Buss. Still shall we chide? and fome upon this bit? Is the Guise onely great in faction? Stands he not by himselfe? Proves he th'Opinion That mens soules are without them? Be a Duke, And lead me to the field. Guis. Come, follow me. Henr. Stay them, stay D' Ambois; Cosen Guise, I wonder Your honour'd disposition brooks so ill A man so good, that only would uphold Man in his native noblesse, from whose fall All our dissentions rise; that in himselfe (Without the outward patches of our frailty, Riches and honour) knowes he comprehends Worth with the greatest: Kings had never borne Such boundlesse Empire over other men, Had all maintain'd the spirit and state of D' Ambois; Nor had the full impartiall hand of nature That all things gave in her originall, Without these definite terms of Mine and Thine, Beene turn'd unjustly to the hand of Fortune, Had all preserv'd her in her prime, like D' Ambois; No envie, no disiunction had dissolv'd, Or pluck'd one stick out of the golden faggot. In which the world of Saturne bound our lifes, Had all beene held together with the nerves, The genius and th'ingenious soule of D' Ambois. Let my hand therefore be the Hermean rod To part and reconcile, and so conserve you, As my combin'd embracers and supporters. Buss. Tis our Kings motion, and we shall not seeme (To worst eies) womanish, though we change thus soone. Never so great grudge for his greater pleasure. Gui. I seale to that, and so the manly freedome That you so much professe, hereafter prove not A bold and glorious licence to deprave, To me his hand shall hold the Hermean vertue His grace affects, in which submissive signe On this his sacred right hand, I lay mine. Buss. Tis well my Lord, and so your worthy greatnesse Decline not to the greater insolence, Nor make you think it a Prerogative, To rack mens freedomes with the ruder wrongs; My hand (stuck full of lawrell, in true signe Tis wholly dedicate to righteous peace) In all submission kisseth th'other side. Hen. Thanks to ye both: and kindly I invite ye Both to a banquet where weele sacrifice Full cups to confirmation of your loves; At which (faire Ladies) I entreat your presence. And hope you Madam will take one carowse For reconcilement of your Lord and servant. Duches. If I should faile my Lord, some other Lady Would be found there to doe that for my servant. Mons. Any of these here? Duches. Nay, I know not that. D' Amb. Think your thoughts, like my Mistresse, honour'd Lady. Tamy. I think not on you Sir, y'are one I know not. D' Amb. Cry you mercy Madam. Exeunt Henry, D' Amb. Ladies. Monts. Oh Sir, has she met you? Mons. What had my bounty drunk when it rais'd him? Gui. Y'ave stuck us up a very worthy flag, That takes more winde than we with all our failes. Mons. O so he spreds and flourishes. Gui. He must downe, Upstarts should never perch too neere a crowne. Mons. Tis true my Lord; and as this doting hand, Even out of earth, (like Juno) struck this Giant, So Joves great ordnance shall be here implide To strike him under th' Ãtna of his pride: To which work lend your hands and let us cast Where we may set snares for his ranging greatnes: I think it best; amongst our greatest women: For there is no such trap to catch an upstart As a loose downfall: for you know their falls Are th'ends of all mens rising: if great men And wise make scapes to please advantage, Tis with a woman: women that worst may Still hold mens candels: they direct and know All things amisse in all men; and their women All things amisse in them: through whose charm'd mouthes We may see all the close scapes of the Court: When the most royall beast of chase, the Hart (Being old; and cunning in his layres and haunts) Can never be discovered to the bow The peece or hound: yet where (behind some Queich) He breaks his gall, and rutteth with his hinde, The place is maskt, and by his Venery He still is taken. Shall we then attempt The chiefest meane to that discovery here, And court our greatest Ladies chiefest women, With shewes of love, and liberall promises? Tis but our breath. If something given in hand, Sharpen their hopes of more, 'twill be well ventur'd. Gui. No doubt of that: and 'tis the cunningst point Of our devis'd investigation. Mons. I have broken The yce to it already with the woman Of your chast Lady, and conceive good hope, I shall wade thorow to some wished shore At our next meeting. Monts. Nay, there's small hope there. Guise. Take say of her my Lord, she comes most fitly. Mons. Starting back? Enter Charlot, Anable, Pero. Gui. Y'are ingag'd indeed. Char. Nay, pray my Lord forbeare. Mont. What skittish, servant? An. No my Lord, I am not so fit for your service. Char. Pray pardon me now my Lord? my Lady expects me. Gui. Ile satisfie her expectation, as far as an Vnkle may. Mons. Well said: a spirit of Courtship of all hands: Now mine owne Pero: hast thou remembred me For the discovery I entreated thee to make of thy Mistresse? speak boldly, and be sure, of all things I have sworne to thee. Pero. Building on that assurance (my Lord) I may speak: and much the rather, because my Lady hath not trusted me with that I can tell you; for now I cannot be said to betray her. Mons. That's all one, so wee reach our objects: forth I beseech thee. Per. To tell you truth, my Lord, I have made a strange discovery. Mons. Excellent! Pero thou reviv'st me: may I sink quick to perdition, if my tongue discover it. Per. Tis thus then: This last night my Lord lay forth: and I watching my Ladies sitting up, stole up at midnight from my pallat, and (having before made a hole both through the wall and arras to her inmost chamber) I saw D' Ambois and her selfe reading a letter. Mons. D' Ambois? Per. Even he my Lord. Mons. Do'st thou not dreame wench? Per. I sweare, he is the man. Mons. The devill he is, and thy Lady his dam: Why this was the happiest shot? that ever flewe the just plague of hypocrisie level'd it, Oh the infinite regions betwixt a womans tongue and her heart: is this our Goddesse of chastity? I thought I could not be so sleighted, if she had not her fraught besides: and therefore plotted this with her woman: never dreaming of D' Amboys. Deare Pero I will advance thee for ever: but tell me now: Gods pretious it transformes mee with admiration: sweet Pero, whom should she trust with this conveyance? Or, all the dores being made sure, how should his conveyance be made? Per. Nay my Lord, that amazes me: I cannot by any study so much as guesse at it. Mons. Well, let's favour our apprehensions with forbearing that a little: for if my heart were not hoopt with adamant, the conceipt of this would have burst it: but heark thee. Whispers. Mont. I pray thee resolve mee: the Duke will never imagine that I am busie about's wife: hath D' Ambois any privy accesse to her? An. No my Lord, D' Ambois neglects her (as shee takes it) and is therefore suspicious that either your Lady, or the Lady Beaupre hath closely entertain'd him. Mont. Ber lady a likely suspition, and very neere the life; especially of my wife. Mons. Come, we'l disguise all, with seeming onely to have courted; away dry palm: sh'as a livor as dry as a bisket: a man may goe a whole voyage with her, and get nothing but tempests from her windpipe. Gui. Here's one, (I think) has swallowed a Porcupine, shee casts pricks from her tongue so. Mont. And here's a Peacock seemes to have devour'd one of the Alpes, she has so swelling a spirit, &amp; is so cold of her kindnes. Char. We are no windfalls my Lord; ye must gather us with the ladder of matrimony, or we'l hang till we be rotten. Mons. Indeed that's the way to make ye right openarses. But alas ye have no portions fit for such husbands as we wish you. Per. Portions my Lord, yes and such portions as your principality cannot purchase. Mons. What woman? what are those portions? Per. Riddle my riddle my Lord. Mons. I marry wench, I think thy portion is a right riddle, a man shall never finde it out: but let's heare it. Per. You shall my Lord. What's that, that being most rar's most cheap? That when you sow, you never reap? That when it growes most, most you in it? And still you lose it when you win it? That when tis commonest, tis dearest, And when tis farthest off, 'tis neerest? Mons. Is this your great portion? Per. Even this my Lord. Mons. Beleeve me I cannot riddle it. Per. No my Lord, tis my chastity, which you shall neither riddle nor fiddle. Mons. Your chastity? let me begin with the end of it; how is a womans chastity neerest a man, when tis furthest off? Per. Why my Lord, when you cannot get it, it goes to th' heart on you; and that I think comes most neere you: and I am sure it shall be farre enough off; and so wee leave you to our mercies. Exeunt women. Mons. Farewell riddle. Gui. Farewell Medlar. Mont. Farewell winter plum. Mons. Now my Lords, what fruit of our inquisition? feele you nothing budding yet? Speak good my Lord Mountsurry. Mont. Nothing but this: D' Ambois is thought negligent in observing the Duchesse, and therefore she is suspicious that your Neece or my wife closely entertaines him. Mons. Your wife, my Lord? Think you that possible? Mont. Alas, I know she flies him like her last houre. Mons. Her last houre? why that comes upon her the more she flies it: Does D' Ambois so think you? Mont. That's not worth the answering; Tis miraculous to think with what monsters womens imaginations engrosse them when they are once enamour'd, and what wonders they will work for their satisfaction. They will make a sheepe valiant, a Lion fearefull. Mons. And an Asse confident, well my Lord, more will come forth shortly, get you to the banquet. Guise. Come my Lord, I have the blind side of one of them. Exit Guise cum Mont. Mouns. O the unsounded Sea of womens bloods, That when tis calmest, is most dangerous; Not any wrinkle creaming in their faces, When in their hearts are Scylla and Caribdis, Which still are hid in dark and standing foggs, Where never day shines, nothing ever growes, But weeds and poysons, that no States-man knowes; Not Cerberus ever saw the damned nookes Hid with the veiles of womens vertuous lookes. But what a cloud of sulphur have I drawne Up to my bosome in this dangerous secret? Which if my hast (with any spark) should light Ere D' Ambois were engag'd in some sure plot I were blowne up; He would be sure, my death. Would I had never knowne it, for before I shall perswade th'importance to Montsurry, And make him with some studied stratagem, Train D' Ambois to his wreak, his maid may tell it, Or I (out of my fiery thirst to play With the fell Tyger, up in darknesse tyed, And give it some light) make it quite break loose. I feare it afore heaven, and will not see D' Ambois againe, till I have told Montsurry, And set a snare with him to free my feares: whose there? Enter Maffe. Maffe. My Lord? Mons. Goe call the Count Montsurry, And make the dores fast, I will speak with none Till he come to me. Maffe. Well my Lord. Exiturus. Mons. Or else Send you some other, and see all the dores Made safe your selfe I pray, hast, flie about it. Maffe. You'l speak with none but with the Count Montsurry. Mont. With none but hee except it be the Guise. Maffe. See even by this, there's one exception more, Your Grace must be more firme in the command, Or else shall I as weakly execute. The Guise shall speak with you? Mons. He shall I say. Maffe. And Count Montsurry? Mons. I, and Count Montsurry. Maffe. Your Grace must pardon me, that I am bold To urge the cleare and full sence of your pleasure; Which when so ever I have knowne, I hope Your Grace will say, I hit it to a haire. Mons. You have. Maffe. I hope so, or I would be glad.â Mons. I pray thee get thee gone, thou art so tedious In the strickt forme of all thy services, That I had better have one negligent. You hit my pleasure well, when D' Ambois hit you, Did you not, think you? Maffe. D' Ambois? why my Lord? Mons. I pray thee talk no more, but shut the dores. Doe what I charge thee. Maffe. I will my Lord, and yet I would be glad the wrong I had of D' Amboisâ Mons. Precious! then it is a Fate that plagues me In this mans foolery, I may be murthered While he stands on protection of his folly. Avant about thy charge. Maffe. I goe my Lord. I had my head broke in his faithfull service, I had no suit the more, nor any thanks, And yet my teeth must still be hit with D' Ambois. D' Ambois my Lord shall know.â Mons. The devill and D' Ambois. Exit Maffe. How am I tortur'd with this trusty foole? Never was any curious in his place To doe things justly, but he was an Asse: We cannot finde one trusty that is witty, And therefore beare their disproportion. Grant thou great starre, and angell of my life, A sure lease of it but for some few dayes, That I may cleare my bosome of the Snake I cherisht there, and I will then defie All check to it but Natures, and her Altars Shall crack with vessels crown'd with ev'ry liquor Drawn from her highest, and most bloudy humors. I feare him strangely, his advanced valour Is like a spirit rais'd without a circle, Endangering him that ignorantly rais'd him, And for whose fury he hath learnt no limit. Enter Maffe hastily. Maffe. I cannot help it, what should I do more? As I was gathering a fit Guard to make My passage to the dores, and the dores sure, The man of bloud is enter'd. Mons. Rage of death. If I had told the secret, and he knew it, Thus had I bin endanger'd:âMy sweet heart! How now? what leap'st thou at? Enter D' Ambois. D' Amb. O royall object. Mons. Thou dream'st awake: Object in th'empty aire? D' Amb. Worthy the browes of Titan, worth his chaire. Mons. Pray thee what mean'st thou? D' Amb. See you not a Crowne Empale the forehead of the great King Monsieur? Mons. O fie upon thee. D' Amb. Prince, that is the Subject Of all these your retir'd and sole discourses. Mons. Wilt thou not leave that wrongfull supposition? D' Amb. Why wrongfull? to suppose the doubtlesse right To the succession worth the thinking on. Mons. Well, leave these jests, how I am over-joyed With thy wish'd presence, and how fit thou com'st, For of mine honour I was sending for thee. D' Amb. To what end? Mons. Onely for thy company, Which I have still in thought, but that's no payment On thy part made with personall appearance. Thy absence so long suffered oftentimes Put me in some little doubt thou do'st not love me. Wilt thou doe one thing therefore now sincerely? D' Amb. I, any thing, but killing of the King. Mons. Still in that discor'd, and ill taken note? How most unseasonable thou playest the Cucko, In this thy fall of friendship? D' Amb. Then doe not doubt, That there is any act within my nerves, But killing of the King that is not yours. Mons. I will not then; to prove which by my love Shewne to thy vertues, and by all fruits else Already sprung from that still flourishing tree, With whatsoever may hereafter spring, I charge thee utter (even with all the freedome Both of thy noble nature and thy friendship) The full and plaine state of me in thy thoughts. D' Amb. What, utter plainly what I think of you? Mons. Plaine as truth. D' Amb. Why this swims quite against the stream of greatnes. Great men would rather heare their flatteries, And if they be not made fooles, are not wise. Mons. I am no such great foole, and therefore charge thee Even from the root of thy free heart display mee. D' Amb. Since you affect it in such serious termes, If your selfe first will tell me what you think As freely and as heartily of me, I'le be as open in my thoughts of you. Mons. A bargain of mine honour; and make this, That prove we in our full dissection Never so foule, live still the sounder friends. D' Amb. What else Sir t'come pay me home, ile bide it bravely. Mons. I will I sweare. I think thee then a man, That dares as much as a wilde horse or Tyger; As headstrong and as bloody; and so feed The ravenous wolfe of thy most Caniball valour, (Rather than not employ it) thou would'st turne Hackster to any whore, slave to a Jew, Or English usurer, to force possessions, And cut men's throats of morgaged estates; Or thou would'st tire thee like a Tinkers strumpet. And murther market folks, quarrell with sheepe, And runne as mad as Ajax; serve a Butcher, Doe any thing but killing of the King: That in thy valour th'art like other naturalls, That have strange gifts in nature, but no soule Diffus'd quite through, to make them of a peece, But stop at humours, that are more absurd, Childish and villanous than that hackster; whore, Slave, cut-throat, Tinkers bitch, compar'd before: And in those humours would'st envie, betray, Slander, blaspheme, change each houre a religion; Doe any thing, but killing of the King; That in thy valour (which is still the dunghill, To which hath reference all filth in thy house) Th'art more ridiculous and vaine-glorious Than any Mountibank; and impudent Than any painted Bawd; which, not to sooth And glorifie thee like a Iupiter Hammon, Thou eat'st thy heart in vineger; and thy gall Turns all thy blood to poyson, which is cause Of that Toad-poole that stands in thy complexion; And makes thee (with a cold and earthy moisture, Which is the damme of portifaction, As plague to thy damn'd pride) rot as thou liv'st; To study calumnies and treacheries; To thy friends slaughters, like a Scrich-owle sing, And to all mischiefes, but to kill the King. D' Amb. So: Have you said? Mons. How thinkest thou? Doe I flatter? Speak I not like a trusty friend to thee? D' Amb. That ever any man was blest withall; So here's for me. I think you are (at worst) No devill, since y'are like to be no King; Of which, with any friend of yours Ile lay This poore Stillado here, 'gainst all the starres, I, and 'gainst all your treacheries, which are more; That you did never good, but to doe ill; But ill of all sorts, free and for it selfe: That (like a murthering peece, making lanes in Armies The first man of a rank, the whole rank falling) If you have wrong'd one man, you are so farre From making him amends, that all his race, Friends and associates fall into your chace: That y'are for perjuries the very prince Of all intelligencers; and your voice Is like an Easterne winde, that where it flies, Knits nets of Catterpillars, with which you catch The prime of all the fruits the Kingdome yeelds. That your politicall head is the curst fount Of all the violence, rapine, cruelty, Tyrannie &amp; Atheisme flowing through the realme. That y'ave a tongue so scandalous, 'twill cut The purest Christall; and a breath that will Kill to that wall a spider; you will jest With God, and your soule to the devill tender For lust; kisse horror, and with death engender. That your foule body is a Lernean fenne Of all the maladies breeding in all men. That you are utterly without a soule: And (for your life) the thred of that was spunne, When Clotho slept, and let her breathing rock Fall in the durt; and Lachesit still drawes it, Dipping her twisting fingers in a boule Defil'd, and crown'd with vertues forced soule. And lastly (which I must for Gratitude Ever remember) That of all my height And dearest life, you are the onely spring, Onely in royall hope to kill the King. Mons. Why now I see thou lov'st me, come to the banquet. Exeunt. Finis Actus tertij.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quarti Scena Prima. Henry, Monsieur with a Letter, Guise, Montsurry, Bussy, Elynor, Tamyra, Beaupre, Pero, Charlotte, Anable, Pyrha, with foure Pages. Henr. Ladies, ye have not done our banquet right, Nor lookt upon it with those cheerefull rayes That lately turn'd your breaths to flouds of gold; Your looks, methinks, are not drawne out with thoughts, So cleare and free as heretofore, but foule As if the thick complexions of men Govern'd within them. Buss. 'Tis not like my Lord That men in women rule, but contrary; For as the Moone (of all things God created) Not only is the most appropriate image Or glasse to shew them how they wax and wane, But in her height and motion likewise beares Imperiall influences that command In all their powers, and make them wax and wane; So women, that (of all things made of nothing) Are the most perfect Idols of the Moone, (Or still-unwean'd sweet Moon-calves with white faces) Not only are paterns of change to men: But as the tender Moon-shine of their beauties Cleares, or is cloudy, make men glad or sad, So then they rule in men, not men in them. Mons. But here the Moons are chang'd (as the King notes) And either men rule in them, or some power Beyond their voluntary faculty: For nothing can recover their lost faces. Montsur. None can be alwayes one: our griefes and joyes Hold severall scepters in us, and have times For their divided Empires: which griefe now, in them Doth prove as proper to his diadem. D' Amb. And griefe's a naturall sicknesse of the bloud, That time to part asks, as his comming had; Onely sleight fooles griev'd, suddenly are glad; A man may say t'a dead man, be reviv'd, As well as to one sorrowfull, be not griev'd. And therefore (Princely Mistresse) in all warres Against these base foes that insult on weaknesse, And still fight hous'd, behind the shield of Nature, Of priviledge low, treachery, or beastly need, Your servant cannot help; authority here Goes with corruption; something like some States, That back woorst men; valour to them must creepe That (to themselves lost) would fear him asleepe. Duches. Ye all take that for granted, that doth rest Yet to be prov'd; we all are as we were, As merry, and as free in thought as ever. Gui. And why then can ye not disclose your thoughts? Tamy. Me thinks the man hath answer'd for us well. Mons. The man? why Madam dice not know his name? Tamy. Man is a name of honour for a King: Additions take away from each chiefe thing: The Schoole of Modesty, not to learne, learnes Dames: They sit in high formes there, that know mens names. Mons. Heark sweet heart, here's a bar set to your valour: It cannot enter here; no, not to notice Of what your name is; your great Eagles beak (Should you flie at her) had as good encounter An Albion cliffe, as her more craggy liver. D' Amb. Ile not attempt her Sir; her sight and name (By which I onely know her) doth deter me. Henr. So doe they all men else. Mons. You would say so If you knew all. Tamy. Knew all my Lord? what meant you? Mons. All that I know Madam. Tamy. That you know? speak it. Mons. No tis enough I feele it. Henr. But me thinks Her Courtship is more pure then heretofore: True Courtiers should be modest, and not nice; Bold, but not impudent: pleasure love, not vice. Mons. Sweet heart, come hither: what if one should make Horns at Mountsurry? would it not strike him jealous Through all the proofes of his chaste Ladies vertues? D' Amb. If he be wise, not. Mons. What? not if I should name the Gardener, That I would have him think hath grafted him? D' Amb. So the large licence that your greatnesse uses To jest at all men, may be taught indeed To make a difference of the grounds you play on, Both in the men you scandall, and the matter. Mons. As how? as how? D' Amb. Perhaps led with a traine, where you may have Your nose made lesse, and slit, your eyes thrust out. Mons. Peace, peace, I pray thee peace. Who dares doe that? the brother of his King? D' Amb. Were your King brother in you, all your powers (Stretcht in the armes of great men and their Bawds) Set close downe by you, all your stormy lawes Spouted with Lawyers mouthes, and gushing bloud, Like to so many Torrents, all your glories, (Making you terrible, like enchanted flames, Fed with bare cockscombs, and with crooked hammes) All your prerogatives, your shames and tortures, All daring heaven, and opening hell about you, Were I the man ye wrong'd so, and provok'd, (Though ne're so much beneath you) like a box tree I would (out of the roughnesse of my root) Ramme hardnesse, in my lownesse, and like death Mounted on earthquakes, I would trot through all Honors and horrors, thorow soule and faire, And from your whole strength tosse you into the aire. Mons. Goe, th'art a devill; such another spirit Could not be still'd from all th'Armenian dragons, O my Loves glory: heire to all I have: That's all I can say, and that all I sweare. If thou out-live me, as I know thou must, Or else hath nature no proportion'd end To her great labours: she hath breath'd a minde Into thy entrails, of desert to swell Into another great Augustus CÃ¦sar: Organs, and faculties fitted to her greatnesse: And should that perish like a common spirit, Nature's a Courtier and regards no merit. Henr. Here's nought but whispering with us: like a calme Before a tempest, when the silent ayre Layes her soft eare close to the earth to hearken For that she feares steales on to ravish her; Some Fate doth joyne our eares to heare it comming. Come, my brave eagle, let's to Covert flie: I see Almighty Ãther in the smoak Of all his clowds descending, and the skie Exit Henr. with D' Amb. &amp; Ladies. Hid in the dim ostents of Tragedy. Guis. Now stirre the humour, and begin the brawle. Mont. The King and D' Ambois now are growne all one. Mons. Nay, they are two my Lord. Mont. How's that? Mons. No more. Mont. I must have more my Lord. Mons. What more than two? Mont. How monstrous is this? Mons. Why? Mont. You make me Horns. Mons. Not I, it is a work without my power, Married mens ensignes are not made with fingers? Of divine Fabrique they are, Not mens hands; Your wife, you know, is a meere Cynthia, And she must fashion hornes out of her Nature. Mont. But doth she? dare you charge her? speak false Prince. Mons. I must not speak my Lord: but if you'l use The learning of a noble man, and read, Here's something to those points: soft you must pawne Your honour having read it to return it. Enter Tamira &amp; Pero. Mont. Not I, I pawne mine Honour for a paper? Mons. You must not buy it under; Exeunt Guise and Monsieur. Mont. Keepe it then, And keepe fire in your bosome. Tam. What sayes he? Mont. You must make good the rest. Tam. How fares my Lord? Takes my Love any thing to heart he sayes? Mont. Come, y'are a.â Tam. What my Lord? Mont. The plague of Herod Feast in his rotten entrailes. Tam. Will you wreak Your angers just cause given by him, on me? Mont. By him? Tamy. By him my Lord, I have admir'd You could all this time be at concord with him, That still hath plaid such discords on your honour. Mont. Perhaps tis with some proud string of my wives. Tam. How's that, my Lord? Mont. Your tongue will still admire, Till my head be the miracle of the world. Tam. O woe is me. She seemes to sound. Pero. What does your Lordship meane? Madam, be comforted; my Lord but tries you. Madam? Help good my Lord, are you not mov'd? Doe your set looks print in your words your thoughts? Sweet Lord, cleare up those eyes, unbend that masking forehead, Whence is it you rush upon her with these Irish warres, More full of sound then hurt? but it is enough, You have shot home, your words are in her heart; She has not liv'd to beare a triall now. Mont. Look up my Love, and by this kisse receive My soule amongst thy spirits for supply To thine, chac'd with my fury. Tam. O my Lord, I have too long liv'd to heare this from you. Mont. 'Twas from my troubled bloud, and not from me: I know not how I fare; a sudden night Flowes through my entrailes, and a headlong Chaos Murmurs within me, which I must digest; And not drowne her in my confusions, That was my lives joy, being best inform'd; Sweet, you must needs forgive me, that my love (Like to a fire disdaining his suppression) Rag'd being discourag'd; my whole heart is wounded When any least thought in you is but touch't, And shall be till I know your former merits: Your name and memory altogether crave In just oblivion their eternall grave; And then you must heare from me, there's no meane In any passion I shall feele for you: Love is a rasor cleansing being well us'd, But fetcheth blood still being the least abus'd: To tell you briefly all; The men that left me When you appear'd, did turne me worse than woman, And stab'd me to the heart thus, with his fingers. Tamy. O happy woman! Comes my stain from him? It is my beauty, and that innocence proves, That flew Chymara, rescu'd Peleus From all the savage beasts in Peleon; And rais'd the chaste Athenian Prince from hell: All suffering with me; they for womens lusts, I for a mans; that the Fgean stable Of his foule sinne would empty in my lap: How his guilt shunn'd me? sacred innocence That where thou fearst, are dreadfull; and his face Turn'd in flight from thee, that had thee in chace: Come, bring me to him: I will tell the serpent Even to his venom'd teeth (from whose curst seed A pitcht field starts up 'twixt my Lord and me) That his throat lies, and he shall curse his fingers, For being so govern'd by his filthy soule. Mont. I know not, if himselfe will vaunt t'have beene The princely Author of the slavish sinne, Or any other; he would have resolv'd me, Had you not come; not by his word, but writing. Would I have sworne to give it him againe, And pawn'd mine honour to him for a paper. Tam. See how he flies me still: Tis a foule heart That feares his owne hand: Good my Lord make haste To see the dangerous paper: Papers hold Oft-times the formes, and copies of our soules, And (though the world despise them) are the prizes Of all our honors, make your honour then A hostage for it, and with it conferre My neerest woman here, in all she knowes; Who (if the sunne of Cerberus could have seene Any staine in me) might as well as they: And Pero, here I charge thee by my love, And all proofes of it, (which I might call bounties) By all that thou hast seene seeme good in mee, And all the ill which thou shouldst spit from thee, By pity of the wound this touch hath given me, Not as thy Mistresse now, but a poore woman (To death given over) rid me of my paines, Powre on thy powder: cleare thy breast of me: My Lord is only here: here speak thy worst, Thy best will doe me mischiefe; If thou spar'st me, Never shine good thought on thy memory: Resolve my Lord, and leave me desperate. Pero. My Lord? My Lord hath plaid a prodigals part, To break his Stock for nothing; and an insolent, To cut a Gordian when he could not loose it: What violence is this, to put true fire To a false train? To blow up long crown'd peace With sudden outrage? and beleeve a man Sworne to the shame of women, 'gainst a woman, Borne to their honours: but I will to him. Tam. No, I will write (for I shall never more Meet with the fugitive) where I will defie him, Were he ten times the brother of my King. To him my Lord, and ile to cursing him. Exeunt. Enter D' Ambois and Frier. D' Amb. I am suspitious my most honour'd Father, By some of Monsieurs cunning passages, That his still ranging and contentious nose thrils; To scent the haunts of mischief: have so us'd The vicious vertue of his busie sence, That he trails hotly of him, and will rowze him, Driving him all enrag'd, and foming on us, And therefore have entreated your deepe skill, In the command of good aeriall spirits, To assume these Magick rites, and call up one To know if any have reveal'd unto him Any thing touching my deare Love and me. Frier. Good sonne you have amaz'd me but to make The least doubt of it, it concernes so neerely The faith and reverence of my name and order, Yet will I justifie upon my soule All I have done, if any spirit i'th earth or aire Can give you the resolve, doe not despaire. Musick: and Tamira enters with Pero and her maid, bearing a Letter. Tam. Away, deliver it: O may my lines Exit Pero. (Fill'd with the poyson of a woman's hate When he shall open them) shrink up his curst eyes With torturous darknesse, such as stands in hell, Stuck full of inward horrors, never lighted; With which are all things to be fear'd, affrighted. D' Amb. How is it with my honour'd Mistresse? Tam. O servant help, and save me from the gripes Of shame and infamy. Our love is knowne, Your Monsieur hath a paper where is writ Some secret tokens that decipher it. D' Amb. What cold dull Northern brain, what foole but he, Durst take into his Epimethean breast A box of such plagues as the danger yeelds, Incur'd in this discovery? He had better Ventur'd his breast in the consuming reach Of the hot surfets cast out of the clouds, Or flood the bullets that (to wreak the skie) The Cyclops ramme in Ioves artillerie. Frier. We soone will take the darknesse from his face That did that deed of darknesse; we will know What now the Monsieur and your husband doe; What is contain'd within the secret paper Offer'd by Monsieur, and your loves events: To which ends (honour'd daughter) at your motion I have put on these exorcising Rites, And, by my power of learned holinesse Vouchsaft me from above, I will command Our resolution of a raised spirit. Tamy. Good Father raise him in some beauteous forme, That with least terror I may brook his sight. Frier. Stand sure together then what ere you see, And stir not, as ye tender all our lives. He puts on his robes. Occidentalium legionum spiritualium imperator (magnus ille Behemoth) veni, veni, comitatus cum Asaroth locotenente invicto. Adjuro te per stygis inscrutabilia areana, per ipsos irremeabiles aufractus averni: adesto Ã´ Behemoth, tu cui pervia funt Magnatum scrinia; veni, per Noctis &amp; tenebrarum abdita profundissima; per labentia sydera; per ipsos motus horarum furtivos, Hecatesq; altum silentium: Appare in forma spiritali, lucente splendida &amp; amabili. Thunder. Ascendit. Beh. What would the holy Frier? Frier. I would see What now the Monsieur and Mountsurrie doe; And see the secret paper that the Monsieur Offer'd to Count Montsurry, longing much To know on what events the secret loves Of these two honour'd persons shall arrive. Beh. Why call'dst thou me to this accursed light, To these light purposes? I am Emperor Of that inscrutable darknesse, where are hid All deepest truths, and secrets never seene, All which I know, and command Legions Of knowing spirits that can doe more then these. Any of this my guard that circle me In these blew fires, and out of whose dim fumes Vast murmurs use to break, and from their sounds Articulat voyces, can doe ten parts more Than open such sleight truths, as you require. Frier. From the last nights black depth, I call'd up on: Of the inferiour ablest Ministers, And he could not resolve me; send one then Out of thine owne command, to fetch the paper That Monsieur hath to shew to Count Montsurry. Beh. I will: Cartophylax: thou that properly Hast in thy power all papers so inscrib'd, Glide through all barres to it, and fetch that paper. Car. I will. A Torch removes. Frier. Till he returnes (great prince of darknesse) Tell me, if Monsieur and the Count Montsurry Are yet encounter'd. Beh. Both them and the Guise Are now together. Frier. Shew us all their persons, And represent the place, with all their actions. Beh. The spirit will strait return, and then Ile shew thee: See he is come; why brought'st thou not the paper? Cart. He hath prevented me, and got a spirit Rais'd by another, great in our command, To take the guard of it before I came. Beh. This is your slacknesse, not t'invoke our powers When first your acts set forth to their effects; Yet shall you see it, and themselves: behold They come here &amp; the Earle now holds the paper. Ent. Mons. Gui. Mont. with a paper. D' Amb. May we not heare them? Mons. No, be still and see. D' Amb. I will goe fetch the paper. Frier. Doe not stirre. There's too much distance, and too many locks Twixt you and them: (how neere so e're they seeme) For any man to interrupt their secrets. Tam. O honour'd spirit, flie into the fancie Of my offended Lord: and doe not let him Beleeve what there the wicked man hath written. Pre. Perswasion hath already enter'd him Beyond reflection; peace till their departure. Mons. There is a glasse of Ink where you may see How to make ready black fac'd Tragedy: You now discerne, I hope through all her paintings, Her gasping wrinkles, and fames sepulchres. Gui. Think you he faines my Lord? what hold you now? Doe we maligne your wife: or honour you? Mons. What stricken dumb? nay fie, Lord be not danted: Your case is common: were it ne're so rare Beare it as rarely: now to laugh were manly: A worthy man should imitate the weather That sings in tempests: and being cleare is silent. Gui. Goe home my Lord, and force your wife to write Such loving lines to D' Ambois as she us'd When she desir'd his presence. Mons. Doe my Lord, And make her name her conceal'd messenger: That close and most inennerable Pander That passeth all our studies to exquire: By whom convay the letter to her love: And so you shall be sure to have him come Within the thirsty reach of your revenge; Before which, lodge an ambush in her chamber Behind the arras of your stoutest men All close and soundly arm'd: and let them share A spirit amongst them, that would serve a thousand. Enter Pero with a Letter. Gui. Yet stay a little: see she sends for you. Mons. Poore, loving Lady, she'le make all good yet, Think you not so my Lord? Exit Mont. and stabs Pero. Gui. Alas poore soule. Mons. This was cruelly done y'faith. Per. T'was nobly done. And I forgive his Lordship from my soule. Mons. Then much good doo't thee Pero: hast a letter? Per. I hope it rather be a bitter volume Of worthy curses for your perjury. Guise. To you my Lord. Mons. To me? Now out upon her. Gui. Let me see my Lord. Mons. You shall presently: how fares my Pero? Enter servant. Who's there? take in this Maid, sh'as caught a clap, And fetch my Surgeon to her; Come my Lord, We'l now peruse our letter. Exeunt Mons. Guise. Per. Furies rise Lead her out. Out of the black lines, and torment his soule. Tam. Hath my Lord slaine my woman? Beh. No, she lives. Frier. What shall become of us? Beh. All I can say Being call'd thus late, is briefe, and darkly this: If D' Ambois Mistresse die not her white hand In his forc'd bloud, he shall remaine untoucht: So Father, shall your selfe, but by your selfe: To make this Augurie plainer: when the voyce Of D' Amboys shall invoke me, I will rise, Shining in greater light, and shew him all That will betide ye all; meane time be wise, And curb his valour, with your policies. Descendit cum suis. Buss. Will he appeare to me, when I invoke him? Frier. He will: be sure. Buss. It must be shortly then: For his dark words have tyed my thoughts on knots Till he dissolve, and free them. Tam. In meane time Deare servant, till your powerfull voice revoke him, Be sure to use the policy he advis'd: Lest fury in your too quick knowledge taken Of our abuse, and your defence of me, Accuse me more than any enemy: And Father, you must on my Lord impose Your holiest charges, and the Churches power, To temper his hot spirit: and disperse The cruelty and the bloud, I know his hand Will showre upon our heads, if you put not Your finger to the storme, and hold it up, As my deare servant here must doe with Monsieur. Bus. Ile sooth his plots, and strow my hate with smiles, Till all at once the close mines of my heart Rise at full date, and rush into his bloud: Ile bind his arme in silk, and rub his flesh, To make the veine swell, that his soule may gush Into some kennell, where it longs to lie, And policy shall be flanckt with policy. Yet shall the feeling center where we meet Groane with the wait of my approaching feet: Ile make th'inspired threshals of his Court Sweat with the weather of my horrid steps Before I enter: yet will I appreare Like calme security, before a mine: A Politician, must like lightning melt The very marrow, and not taint the skin: His wayes must not be seene, the superficies Of the greene center must not taste his feet, When hell is plow'd up with his wounding tracts, And all his harvest reap't by hellish facts. Exeunt. Finis Actus quarti.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quinti Scena Prima. Montsurry bare, unbrac't, pulling Tamyra in by the haire, Frier, One bearing light, a standish and paper, which sets a Table. Tamy. O help me Father. Frier. Impious Earle forbeare. Take violent hand from her, or by mine order The King shall force thee. Monts. Tis not violent; come you not willingly? Tamy. Yes good my Lord. Frier. My Lord remember that your soule must seek, Her peace, as well as your revengefull bloud: You ever to this houre have prov'd your selfe A noble, zealous, and obedient sonne, T'our holy mother: be not an Apostate: Your wives offence serves not, (were it the worst You can imagine, without greater proofes) To sever your eternall bonds, and hearts; Much lesse to touch her with a bloudy hand: Nor is it manly (much lesse husbandly) To expiate any frailty in your wife, With churlish strokes, or beastly ods of strength: The stony birth of clowds, will touch no lawrell, Nor any sleeper; your wife is your lawrell, And sweetest sleeper; doe not touch her then Be not more rude than the wild seed of vapour, To her that is more gentle than that rude; In whom kind nature suffer'd one offence But to set off her other excellence. Mont. Good Father leave us: interrupt no more The course I must runne for mine honour sake. Rely on my love to her, which her fault Cannot extinguish: will she but disclose Who was the secret minister of her love, And through what maze he serv'd it, we are friends. Frier. It is a damn'd work to pursue those secrets, That would ope more sinne, and prove springs of slaughter; Nor is't a path for Christian feet to tread; But out of all way to the health of soules; A sinne impossible to be forgiven: Which he that dares commitâ, Mont. Good Father cease: your terrors Tempt not a man distracted; I am apt To outrages that I shall ever rue: I will not passe the verge that bounds a Christian, Nor break the limits of a man nor husband. Com. Then heaven inspire you both with thoughts and deeds Worthy his high respect, and your owne soules. Tamy. Father. Frier. I warrant thee my dearest daughter He will not touch thee, think'st thou him a Pagan; His honor and his soule lies for thy safety. Exit. Mont. Who shall remove the mountaine from my brest, Stand the opening furnace of my thoughts, And set fit out-cries for a soule in hell? Mont. turnes a key. For now it nothing fits my woes to speak, But thunder, or to take into my throat The trump of Heaven; with whose determinate blasts The windes shall burst, and the devouring seas Be drunk up in his sounds; that my hot woes (Vented enough) I might convert to vapour, Ascending from my infamie unseene; Shorten the world, preventing the last breath That kils the living, and regenerates death. Tamy. My Lord, my fault (as you may censure it With too strong arguments) is past your pardon: But how the circumstances may excuse mee Heaven knowes, and your more temperate minde hereafter May let my penitent miseries make you know. Mont. Hereafter? Tis a suppos'd infinite, That from this point will rise eternally: Fame growes in going; in the scapes of vertue Excuses damne her: They be fires in Cities Enrag'd with those winds that lesse lights extinguish. Come Syren, sing, and dash against my rocks Thy ruffin Gally, rig'd with quench for lust: Sing, and put all the nets into thy voice, With which thou drew'st into thy strumpets lap The spawne of Uenus; and in which ye danc'd; That, in thy laps steed, I may digge his tombe, And quit his manhood with a womans sleight, Who never is deceiv'd in her deceit. Sing, (that is, write) and then take from mine eyes The mists that hide the most inscrutable Pandar That ever lapt up an adulterous vomit: That I may see the devill, and survive To be a devill, and then learne to wive: That I may hang him, and then cut him downe, Then cut him up, and with my soules beams search The cranks and cavernes of his braine, and study The errant wildernesse of a womans face; Where men cannot get out, for all the Comets That have beene lighted at it; though they know That Adders lie a sunning in their smiles, That Basilisks drink their poyson from their eyes, And no way there to coast out to their hearts; Yet still they wander there, and are not stay'd Till they be fetter'd, nor secure before All cares devoure them, nor in humane Consort Till they embrace within their wives two breasts All Pelion and CythÃ¦ron with their beasts. Why write you not? Tam. O, good my Lord forbeare In wreak of great faults to engender greater, And make my Loves corruption generate murther. Mont. It followes needfully as childe and parent; The chaine-shot of thy lust is yet aloft, And it must murther; tis thine owne deare twinne: No man can adde height to a womans sinne. Vice never doth her just hate so provoke, As when she rageth under vertues cloake. Write; For it must be: by this ruthlesse steele, By this impartiall torture, and the death Thy tyrannies have invented in my entrails, To quicken life in dying, and hold up The spirits in fainting, teaching to preserve Torments in ashes, that will ever last. Speak: Will you write? Tam. Sweet Lord enjoyne my sinn: Some other penance than what makes it worse: Hide in some gloomie dungeon my loth'd face, And let condemned murtherers let me downe (Stopping their noses) my abhorred food. Hang me in chaines, and let me eat these armes That have offended: Binde me face to face To some dead woman, taken from the Cart Of Execution, till death and time In graines of dust dissolve me; Ile endure: Or any torture that your wraths invention Can fright all pitie from the world withall: But to betray a friend with shew of friendship, That is too common for the rare revenge Your rage affecteth; here then are my breasts, Last night your pillowes; here my vvretched armes, As late the wished confines of your life: Now break them as you please, and all the bounds Of manhood, noblesse, and religion. Mont. Where all these have bin broken, they are kept, In doing their justice there with any shew Of the like cruell cruelty: Thine armes have lost Their priviledge in lust, and in their torture Thus they must pay it. Stabs her. Tam. O Lord. Mont. Till thou writ'st Ile write in wounds (my wrongs fit characters) Thy right of sufferance. Write. Tam. O kill me, kill me. Deare husband be not crueller than death; You have behold some Gorgon: Feele, O feele How you are turn'd to stone; with my beart blood Dissolve your selfe againe, or you will grow Into the image of all Tyrannie. Mont. As thou art of adultry, I will ever Prove thee my parallel, being most a monster: Thus I expresse thee yet. Stabs her againe. Tam. And yet I live. Mont. I, for thy monstrous idoll is not done yet, This toole hath wrought enough: now Torture use Ent. servants This other engine on th'habituate powers Of her thrice damn'd and whorish fortitude, Use the most madding paines in her that ever Thy venom-sok'd through, making most of death; That she may weigh her wrongs with them, and then Stand vengeance on thy steepest rock a victor. Tamy. O who is turn'd into my Lord and husband? Husband? My Lord? None but my Lord and husband? Heaven, I ask thee remission of my sinnes, Not of my paines: husband, O help me husband. Ascendit Frier with a sword drawne. Frier. What rape of honour and religion? O wrack of nature! Falls and dies. Tam. Poore man: O my Father, Father, look up; O let me downe my Lord, And I will write. Mont. Author of prodigies! What new flame breakes out of the firmament, That turnes up counsels never knowne before? Now is it true, earth moves, and heaven stands still; Even Heaven it selfe must see and suffer ill: The too huge bias of the world hath sway'd Her back-part upwards, and with that she braves This Hemisphere, that long her mouth hath mockt: The gravity of her religious face, (Now growne too waighty with her sacriledge, And here discern'd sophisticate enough) Turnes to th' Antipodes: and all the formes That her illusions have imprest in her, Have eaten through her back: and now all see, How she is riveted with hypocrisie: Was this the way? was he the mean betwixt you? Tam. He was, he was, kind worthy man he was. Mont. Write, write a word or two. Tamy. I will, I will. Ile write, but with my bloud that he may see, These lines come from my wounds &amp; not from me. Writes. Mont. Well might he die for thought: me thinks the frame And shaken joynts of the whole world should crack To see her parts so disproportionate; And that his generall beauty cannot stand Without these staines in the particular man. Why wander I so farre? here, here was she That was a whole world without spot to me, Though now a world of spots; oh what a lightning Is mans delight in women? what a bubble He builds his state, fame, life on, when he marries? Since all earths pleasures are so short and small, The way t'enjoy it, is t'abjure it all. Enough: I must be messenger my selfe, Disguis'd like this strange creature: in, Ile after, To see what guilty light gives this Cave eyes, And to the world sing new impieties. Exeunt. He puts the Frier in the vault and follows, She raps her self in the Arras. Enter Monsieur and Guise. Mons. Now shall we see that nature hath no end In her great works, responsive to their worths, That she that makes so many eyes and soules To see, and fore-see, is stark blind her selfe, And as illiterate men say Latine prayers By rote of heart, and dayly iteration, Not knowing what they say; so Nature layes A deale of stuffe together, and by use Or by the meere necessity of matter Ends such a work, fills it, or leaves it empty Of strength, or vertue error, or cleare truth, Not knowing what she does, but usually Gives that which she calls merit to a man, And beliefe must arrive him on huge riches, Honour, and happinesse, that effects his ruine. Even as in ships of warre whole lasts of powder Are laid (me thinks) to make them last and guard, When a disorder'd spark that powder taking, Blowes up with sodaine violence and horror Ships that (kept empty) had sayl'd long with terror. Guise. He that observes but like a worldly man That which doth oft succeed, and by th'events Values the worth of things, will think it true That Nature works at random, just with you: But with as much proportion she may make A thing that from the feet up to the throat Hath all the wondrous fabrique man should have, And leave it beadlesse for a perfect man; As give a full man valour, vertue, learning, Without an end more excellent then those On whom she no such worthy part bestowes. Mons. Yet shall you see it here, here will be one Young, learned, valiant, vertuous, and full mann'd, One on whom nature spent so rich a hand, That with an ominous eye she wept to see So much consum'd her vertuous treasurie. Yet as the winds sing through a hollow tree, And (since it lets them passe through) let's it stand; But a tree solid (since it gives no way To their wild rage) they rend up by the root: So this whole man (That will not wind with every crooked way, Trod by the servile world) shall reele and fall Before the frantick puffes of blind borne chance, That pipes through empty men, and makes them dance. Not so the Sea raves on the Libian sands, Tumbling her billowes in each others neck: Not so the surges of the Euxian Sea (Neere to the frosty pole, where free Bootes From those dark deep vvaves turnes his radiant teame,) Swell (being enrag'd even from their inmost drop) As fortune swings about the restlesse state Of vertue, now throwne into all mens hate. Enter Montsurry disguis'd with the murtherers. Away my Lord, you are perfectly disguis'd, Leave us to lodge your ambush. Monts. Speed me vengeance. Exit. Mons. Resolve my Masters, you shall meet with one Will try what proofes your privy coats are made on: When he is entred, and you heare us stamp, Approach, and make all sure. Murth. We vvill my Lord. Exeunt. D' Ambois with two Pages with Tapers. D' Amb. Sit up to night, and vvatch, Ile speak vvith none But the old Frier, who bring to me. Pa. We will Sir. Exeunt. D' Amb. What violent heat is this? me thinks the fire Of twenty lives doth on a suddaine flash Through all my faculties: the ayre goes high In this close chamber, and the frighted earth Thunder. Trembles, and shrinks beneath me; the whole house Nods with his shaken burthen: blesse me, heaven. Enter Umb. Frier. Vmb. Note what I want deare sonne, and be fore-warn'd. O there are bloudy deeds past and to come: I cannot stay, a fate doth ravish me: Ile meet thee in the chamber of thy love. Exit. D' Amb. What dismall change is here? the good old Frier Is murther'd; being made knowne to serve my love; And now his restlesse spirit would fore-warne me Of some plot dangerous, and imminent. Note what he wants? he wants his upper weed, He wants his life, and body: which of these Should be the want he meanes, and may supply me With any fit fore-warning? this strange vision, (Together with the dark prediction Us'd by the Prince of darknesse that was rais'd By this embodied shadow) stirre my thoughts With reminiscion of the Spirits promise, Who told me, that by any invocation I should have power to raise him; though it wanted The powerfull vvords, and decent rites of Art; Never had my set braine such need of spirit, T'instruct and cheere it; now then I will claime Performance of his free and gentle vow, T'appeare in greater light; and make more plain His rugged Oracle: I long to know How my deare Mistresse fares; and be inform'd What hand she now holds on the troubled bloud Of her incensed Lord: me thought the Spirit (When he had utter'd his perplext presage) Threw his chang'd countenance headlong into clouds; His forehead bent, as it would hide his face; He knockt his chin against his darkned breast, And struck a churlish silence through his pow'rs. Terror of darknesse, O thou King of flames, That with thy Musique-footed horse dost strike The cleare light out of chrystall, on dark earth, And hurlst instructive fire about the world; Wake, wake, the drowsie and enchanted night, That sleepes with dead eyes in this heavy riddle; Oh thou great Prince of shades where never sunne Stickes his far-darted beames, whose eyes are made To shine in darknesse, and see ever best Where men are blindest, open now the heart Of thy abashed oracle, that for feare Of some ill it includes would faine lie hid, And rise thou with it in thy greater light. Thunders. Surgit Spiritus cum suis. Sp. Thus to observe my vow of apparition In greater light, and explicate thy fate, I come; and tell thee that if thou obey The summons that thy mistresse next will send thee, Her hand shall be thy death. D' Amb. When will she send? Sp. Soone as I set againe, where late I rose. D' Amb. Is the old Frier slaine? Sp. No, and yet lives not. D' Amb. Died he a naturall death? Sp. He did. D' Amb. Who then Will my deare mistresse send? Sp. I must not tell thee. D' Amb. Who lets thee? Sp. Fate. D' Amb. Who are fates ministers? Sp. The Guise and Monsieur. D' Amb. A fit paire of sheeres To cut the threds of Kings, and kingly spirits, And consorts fit to sound forth harmony, Set to the fals of Kingdomes: shall the hand Of my kind Mistresse kill me? Sp. If thou yeeld, Thunders. To her next summons; y'are faire warn'd: farewell. Exit. D' Amb. I must fare well, how ever: though I die My death consenting with his augurie; Should not my powers obay when she commands, My motion must be rebell to my will: My will to life, if when I have obay'd, Her hand should so reward me: they must arme it, Binde me or force it: or I lay my life She rather would convert it many times On her owne bosome, even to many deaths: But were there danger of such violence, I know 'tis farre from her intent to send: And who she should send is as farre from thought, Since he is dead, whose only mean she us'd. Knocks. Whose there? look to the dore: and let him in, Though politick Monsieur, or the violent Guise. Enter Montsurry like the Frier, with a Letter written in bloud. Mont. Haile to my worthy sonne. D' Amb. O lying Spirit! To say the Frier was dead; Ile now beleeve Nothing of all his forg'd predictions. My kinde and honour'd Father, well reviv'd, I have beene frighted with your death, and mine, And told my Mistresse hand should be my death If I obeyed this summons. Monts. I beleev'd your love had bin much clearer, then to give Any such doubt a thought, for she is cleare, And having freed her husbands jealousie, (Of which her much abus'd hand here is witness:) She prayes for urgent cause your instant presence. D' Amb. Why then your prince of spirits may be call'd The prince of lyers. Monts. Holy writ so calls him. D' Amb. What? writ in bloud? Mont. I, 'tis the ink of lovers. D' Amb. O, 'tis a sacred witnesse of her love. So much elixer of her bloud as this Dropt in the lightest dame, would make her firme As heat to fire: and like to all the signes, Commands the life confinde in all my veines: O how it multiplies my bloud with spirit, And makes me apt t'encounter death and hell: But, come kinde Father; you fetch me to heaven, And to that end your holy weed was given. Exeunt. Thunder. Intrat Vmbra Frier, and discovers Tamyra. Frier. Up with these stupid thoughts, still loved daughter, And strike away this heartlesse trance of anguish, Be like the Sunne, and labour in eclipses, Look to the end of woes: oh can you sit Mustering the horrors of your servants slaughter Before your contemplation, and not study How to prevent it? watch when he shall rise, And with a suddaine out-crie of his murther, Blow his retreat before he be revenged. Tamyra. O Father, have my dumb woes wak'd your death? When will our humane griefes be at their height? Man is a tree, that hath no top in cares; No root in comforts; all his power to live Is given to no end, but have power to grieve. Frier. It is the misery of our creation. Your true friend, Led by your husband, shadowed in my weed, Now enters the dark vault. Tamyr. But my dearest Father, Why will not you appeare to him your selfe, And see that none of these deceits annoy him. Frier. My power is limited, alas I cannot, All that I can doeâSee the Cave opens. Exit. D' Amboys at the gulfe. Tamyr. Away (my Love) away, thou wilt be murther'd. Enter Monsieur and Guise above. D' Amb. Murther'd? I know not what that Hebrew means: That word had ne're bin nam'd had all bin D' Ambois. Murther'd? By heaven he is my murtherer That shewes me not a murtherer: what such bugge Abhorreth not the very sleepe of D' Amboys? Murther'd? Who dares give all the room I see T D' Ambois reach? or look with any odds His fight i'th face, upon whose hand fits death; Whose sword hath wings, and every feather pierceth? If I scape Monsieurs Pothecarie Shops, Foutir, for Guises Shambles, 'twas ill plotted They should have mall'd me here, When I was rising, I am up and ready. Let in my politique visitants, let them in, Though entring like so many moving armours, Fate is more strong than arms, and slie than treason, And I at all parts buckl'd in my Fate: Mons., Guise. Why enter not the coward villains? D' Amb. Dare they not come? Enter murtherers with Frier at the other dore. Tam. They come. Murth. 1. Come all at once. Frier. Back coward murtherers, back. Omn. Defend us heaven. Exeunt all but the first. 1. Come ye not on? D' Amb. No, slave, nor goest thou off. Stand you so firme? Will it not enter here? You have a face yet: so in thy lifes flame I burne the first rites to my Mistresse fame. Frier. Breath thee brave sonne against the other charge. D' Amb. O is it true then that my sense first told me? Is my kind Father dead? Tam. He is my Love. 'Twas the Earle my husband in his weed that brought thee. Buss. That was a speeding sleight, and well resembled. Where is that angry Earle my Lord? Come forth And shew your owne face in your owne affaire; Take not into your noble veines the blood Of these base villaines, nor the light reports Of blister'd tongues, for cleare and weighty truth: But me against the world, in pure defence Of your rare Lady, to whose spotlesse name I stand here as a bulwark, and project A life to her renowne, that ever yet Hath beene untainted even in envies eye, And where it would protect a Sanctuarie. Brave Earle come forth, and keep your scandall in: 'Tis not our fault if you enforce the spot, Nor the wreak yours if you performe it not. Enter Mont. with all the murtherers. Mont. Cowards, a fiend or spirit beat ye off? They are your owne faint spirits that have forg'd The fearefull shadowes that your eyes deluded: The fiend was in you; cast him out then thus. D' Ambois hath Montsurry downe. Tam. Favour (my Lord) my Love, O favour him. Pistolis shot within. D' Amb. I will not touch him: Take your life, my Lord, And be appeas'd: O then the coward Fates Have maim'd themselves, and ever lost their honour. Umb. What have ye done slaves? irreligious Lord? Buss. Forbeare them, Father; 'tis enough for me That Guise and Monsieur, death and destinie Come behind D' Ambois: is my body then But penetrable flesh? And must my mind Follow my blood? Can my divine part adde No ayd to th'earthly in extremity? Then these divines are but for forme, not fact: Man is of two sweet Courtly friends compact; A Mistresse and a servant: let my death Define life nothing but a Courtiers breath. Nothing is made of nought, of all things made, Their abstract being a dreame but of a shade. Ile not complaine to earth yet, but to heaven, And (like a man) look upwards even in death. And if Vespasian thought in majestie An Emperour might die standing, why not I? Nay without help, in which I will exceed him; For he died splinted with his chamber Groomes. Prop me, true sword, as thou hast ever done: She offers to help him. The equall thought I beare of life and death, Shall make me faint on no side; I am up Here like a Roman Statue; I will stand Till death hath made me Marble: O my fame Live in despight of murther; take thy wings And haste thee where the gray-ey'd morn perfumes Her Rosie chariot with SabÃ¦an spices, Fly, where the evening from th' Iberean vales, Takes on her swarthy shoulders, Heccate Crown'd with a Grove of Oakes: flie where men feele The burning axeltree: and those that suffer Beneath the chariot of the Snowy Beare: And tell them all that D' Ambois now is hasting To the eternall dwellers; that a thunder Of all their sighes together (for their frailties Beheld in me) may quit my worthlesse fall With a fit volley for my funerall. Vmb. Forgive thy murtherers. Buss. I forgive them all; And you my Lord, their fautor; for true signe Of which unfain'd remission, take my sword; Take it, and onely give it motion, And it shall finde the way to victory By his owne brightnesse, and th'inherent valour My fight hath still'd into't, with charmes of spirit. Now let me pray you, that my weighty bloud Laid in one scale of your impertiall spleene, May sway the forfeit of my worthy love Waid in the other: and be reconcil'd With all forgivenesse to your matchlesse wife. Tam. Forgive thou me deare servant, and this hand That lead thy life to this unworthy end, Forgive it, for the bloud with which 'tis stain'd, In which I writ the summons of thy death: The forced summons, by this bleeding wound, By this here in my bosome: and by this That makes me hold up both my hands embrew'd For thy deare pardon. Buss. O, my heart is broken Fate, nor these murtherers, Monsieur, nor the Guise, Have any glory in my death, but this: This killing spectacle: this prodigie: My sunne is turn'd to blood in whose red beams Pindus and Ossa (hid in drifts of snow Laid on my heart and liver; from their veines) Melt like two hungry torrents: eating rocks Into the Ocean of all humane life, And make it bitter, only with my bloud: O fraile condition of strength, valour; vertue In me (like warning fire upon the top Of some steepe Beacon, on a steeper hill) Made to expresse it: like a falling starre Silently glanc't, that like a thunderbolt, Look't to have stuck and shook the firmament. Moritur. Vmb., Frier. Farewell brave reliques of a compleat man. Look up and see thy spirit made a starre, Jove flames with her rules, and when thou set'st Thy radiant forehead in the firmament, Make the vast chrystall crack with thy receipt: Spread to a world of fire, and the aged skie Cheere with new sparks of old humanity. Frier. Son of the earth, whom my unrested soule Rues t'have begotten in the faith of heaven; Assay to gratulate and pacifie, The soule fled from this worthy by performing The Christian reconcilement he besought Betwixt thee and thy Lady, let her wounds Manlesly digg'd in her, be eas'd and cur'd With balme of thine owne teares: or be assur'd Never to rest free from my haunt and horror. Mont. See how she merits this: still kneeling by And mourning his fall, more than her own fault. Vmb. Remove, deare daughter, and content thy husband: So piety wills thee, and thy servants peace. Tamy. O wretched piety, that art so distract In thine owne constancie; and in thy right Must be unrighteous: if I right my friend I wrong my husband: if his wrong I shunne, The duty of my friend I leave undone; Ill playes on both sides; here and there, it riseth; No place: no good so good, but ill compriseth; O had I never married but for forme, Never vow'd faith but purpos'd to deceive: Never made conscience of any sinne, But clok't it privately, and made it common: Nor never honour'd beene, in blood, or mind, Happy had I beene then, as others are Of the like licence; I had then beene honour'd: Liv'd without envie: custome had benumb'd All sense of scruple, and all note of frailty: My fame had beene untouch'd, my heart unbroken: But (shunning all) I strike on all offence, O husband? deare friend? O my conscience! Mons. Come let's away, my sences are not proofe Against those plaints.â Exeunt Guise, Mons. D' Ambois is borne off. Mont. I must not yeeld to pity nor to love So servile and so trayterous: cease my bloud To wrastle with my honour, fame, and judgement: Away, forsake my house, forbeare complaints Where thou hast bred them: here all things full, Of their owne shame and sorrow, leave my house. Tam. Sweet Lord forgive me, and I will be gone, And till these wounds, that never balme shall close Till death hath enterr'd at them, so I love them (Being opened by your hands) by death be cur'd I never more will grieve you with my sight: Never endure that any roofe shall part Mine eyes and heaven: but to the open Deserts (Like to a hunted Tygres) I will flie: Eating my heart, shunning the steps of men, And look on no side till I be arriv'd. Mont. I doe forgive thee, and upon my knees With hands (held up to heaven) wish that mine honour Would suffer reconcilement to my Love: But since it will not, honour, never serve My Love with flourishing object till it sterve: And as this Taper, though it upwards look, Downwards must needs consume, so let our love; As having lost his hony, the sweet taste Runnes into savour, and will needs retaine A spice of his first parents, till (like life) It sees and dies; so let our love: And lastly, As when the flame is suffer'd to look up, It keepes his luster: but, being thus turn'd downe (His naturall course of usefull light inverted) His owne stuffe puts it out: so let our love Now turne from me, as here I turne from thee, And may both points of heavens strait axeltree Conjoyne in one, before thy selfe and me. Exeunt severally. Finis Actus Quinti &amp; ultimi.</field>

With many hands you have seene D' Ambois slaine, Yet by your grace he may revive againe, And every day grow stronger in his skill To please, as we presume he is in will.
