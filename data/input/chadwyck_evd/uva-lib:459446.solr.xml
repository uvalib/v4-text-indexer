At the particular Cost, and Charges of the Right VVorshipfull, Worthy, and Ancient Society of Skinners.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rursus IÃ´, Magnos clamat noua-Troia Triumphos. Mart. lib. 7. Ep. 5.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honorable, Richard Deane Lord Maior of the most Renowned Citty of London: And to the two worthy Sheriffes, Mr. Rowland Backhouse, and Mr. William Acton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What Honor can bee greater to a Kingdome, than to haue a Citty for beauty, able to match with the Fairest in the World? A Citty, renowned Abroad, admired at Home. London, and her Royall Daughter (Westminster) are the Representatiue body of the general State; for, here our Kings and Queenes keepe their Courts; heere are our Princes, the Peeres, Nobility, Gentry, Lords Spirituall and Temporall, with the Numerous Communalty. London in Forraine Countries is called the Queene of Cities, and the Queene-mother ouer her owne. She is her Kings Chamber-royall, his Golden-Key: His Store-house: The Magazine of Merchandize; the Mistris of Sciences; a Nurse to all the Shieres in England. So famous shee is for her Buildings, that Troy has leap'd out of her own Cinders, to build Her Wals. So remarkable for Priority and Power, that hers is the Master-wheele of the whole Kingdome: As that moues, so the maine Engine works. London is Admirall ouer the Nauy royall of Cities: And as she sayles, the whole Fleete of them keepe their course. Fully to write downe all the Titles, Stiles, and Honors of this our Metrapolis, would weary a 1000. pennes: Apollo shall haue a New Garland of Bayes, to vndertake it. As thus in State, shee her selfe is Glorious; so haue all our Kings held it fit to make her chiefe Ruler eminent, and answerable to her greatnesse. The PrÃ¦torian Dignity is therefore come from the ancient Romans, to inuest with Robes of Honor, our Lord Maior of London: Their Consuls are our Sheriefes; their Senators our Aldermen. The extention of a Lord Maiors power, is euery yeare to bee seene both by Land and Water: Downe as low as Lee in Essex: Vp, as high as Stanes in Middlesex: In both which places, he keepes personall Courts. His House is a Chancery: He the Chancellor to mittigate the fury of Law: Hee the Moderator betweene the griping Rich and the wrangling Poore. All the City Orphans call him Father: All the Widdowes call him their Champion. His Table lyes spread to Courtiers, and Free to all Gentlemen of fashion. More to Proclaime his Greatnesse, what Vice-roy is install'd with louder popular acclamations? What Deputie to his Soraigne goes along with such Triumphes? To behold them, Kings, Queenes, Princes, and Embassadors (from all parts of the World) haue with Admiration, reioyced. These Triumphall passages are full of Magnificence for State, Munificence for Cost, and Beneficence for doing good. For besides all the twelue Companies, (euery one of which is a gayner by this imployment:) it would puzzle a good memory to reckon vp all those Trades-men (with other extraordinary Professions which liue not in the City) who get money by this Action. Then by this meanes, are euery Yeare added to those that were before, three Faire, Spacious, and Pallacious Houses, Beautified, Painted, and Adorned. The Lord Maior of London (like a Prince) hath likewise his Variety of Noble Recreations: As Hunting, Shooting, Wrastling, before him, and such like. Thus hauing (as it were in Lantschip) a farre off shewne you the Toppes onely of our City-Buildings; and in a little Picture drawne the Face of her Authority, giuing but a glimpse of her PrÃ¦tor as hee passes by; let mee now open a Booke to you, of all those Ceremonies, which this great Festiuall day hath prouided to Attend vppon him, and doe him Honor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first Shew, is called a Sea-Consort. The first Salutation being on the VVater, is furnished with Persons and Properties fitting the quality of that Element. An Artificiall Rocke therefore is queintly contriued: On whose highest Ascent sits Amphitrite Queene of the Seas, habited to her State; a Mantle frindg'd with siluer crossing her Body: Her Hayre long, and disheuelled, on her head, a phantasticke dressing made out of a Fishes writhen shell, interwouen with Pearle, the shell is siluer, on the top of it stands an Artificiall moouing Torroyse: On each side of her, swimme two Mermaides. These two intic'd by the variety of seuerall instruments (ecchoing to one another) haue followed the Sea-Soueraigne, and waite vppon her, as Maides of Honor. Round about the Rocke are Sea-Nimphes, and in places conuenient for them are bestowed our three famous Riuers, Humber, Trent, and Seuerne, aptly attired according to the quality of such Marine Persons, who play vpon Cornets. Amphitryte is the Speaker. From whom are deliuered these lines. Haile worthy PrÃ¦tor, (Haile Graue Senators) The Queene of Waues (leauing Gray Neptunes Bowres) Waites here (Faire Lord) to serue you. Fames Report, (So farre as old Oceanus Christall Court) What Tryumphes Ceremony forth would Call To Swell the Ioyes of This Grand Festiuall, Intic'de me with my Mermaydes and a Traine Of Sea-Nymphes hither. Here (this day) shall Reigne Pleasures in State Maiesticke: And to lend A brighter Splendor to them, do Attend Three of my Noblest Children, Humber, Trent, And Seuerne (Glorious made by Punishment.) The Siluer footed Thames (my eldest sonne) To Grace your Tryumphes, by your Barge shall runne. Your Fortunes (led by a white-handed Fate Vp to this High Fame) I Congratulate: Glad am I to behold you Thus Set Round With Glories, Thus with Acclamations Crownd, So Circled, and Hembd in, on Euery side With Ecchoing Musicke, Fishes euen take pride To Swimme along, and listen, Goe, and Take The Dignity stayes for you, whilst I make Smooth way Before you, on This Glassy Floore, Vshering your glad Arriuall to the Shore. To Honors Temple now you haue not farre, Hye, and Come backe more Great than yet you Are, On, And so the Cornets playing one to Another, they goe forward. If her Maiestie be pleased on the Water, or Land, to Honor These Tryumphes with her Presence; This following Speech in French is then deliuered to her, with a Booke of the Presentatiens, All the Couer, being set thicke with Flowre de Luces in Gold. Madame, Voicy, maintenant les Quatre Elements qui vos Attendent pour vous faire Honneur. L'eau est Couverte de Triomphes flottans, pour Dancer en L'Air: E'L'Air est Remply de Mille Echos, &amp; Retentit de la doulce Musique, que leur voix resonne, pour Attirer vos oreilles fauorables a les Escouter. Puis vous auez sur la, Terre dix mille Mains qui vous Applaudissent pour Ioy &amp; Allegresse quelles ressentent de voir vostre Maieste dans la Ville. L'Element du Feu, Bruit &amp; Tonne vostre Bien Venue. Vos Subjects accourent Ã  grand Foulle, rauis de voir les Graces qui ont choisi leur Throsne sur vostre Front. Toutes les Deliees d'Amour se IouÃ«nt sur vos paupieres, La Rose d'Angleterre, &amp; les Fleurs de lis de France S'entrebaisent sur le Vermeil de vos IouÃ«s. Soyez Saine comme le printemps, Glorieuse comme l'Este, Autant Fructeuse que la vigne. Que Seurte guarde, &amp; Enuironne vostre Chariot le Iour: Et le Sommeil dore Dresse &amp; orne vostre Chambre de Nuict. Viuez longuement: Viuez Heureuze: Viuez aimee, &amp; Cherie. Bonte vous guarde; Vertu vous Couronne; Et les Anges vous guident. Thus Englished. Royall Lady, Behold, the foure Elements waite vpon you to do you Honor: Water hath prouided Floating Tryumphes to Dance in the Aire: In the Aire are a Thousand Ecchoes with Musick in their Mouthes, to Intice you to heare them: On the Shore shall ten thousand paire of hands giue you Plaudits in the Citty: The Element of Fire, Thunders aloud your welcomes. Thronges of Subjects here, are glad to see the Graces Inthroand on your Forehead: All the Delicacies of Loue, playing on your Eye-lids, The Roses of England, and the Lillies of France, Kissing one Another on your Cheekes. Be you healthfull as the Spring; Glorious as Summer: Fruitfull as the Vine. Safety runne along your Chariot by Day; Golden Slumbers dresse vp your Chamber at Night. Liue long, Goodnesse Guard you, Liue happy, Vertues Crowne you, Liue beloude, Angels Guide you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The second Presentation, New Troyes Tree of Honor. A Person in a rich Romane Antique Habit, with an ornament of Steeples, Towers, and Turrets on her head, Sits in a queint Arbor, Interwouen with seuerall Branches of Flowers. In her Left hand, she holds a golden Truncheon (leaning on the ground) to shew that shees a Leader &amp; Conductresse of a Mighty People: Her Right Hand (thrusting through the Arbor) takes hold of a Tree, out of which spread Twelue Maine and Goodly Branches. This Lady (thus sitting) Represents London: The Tree (guarded, and supported by her) The 12. Superior Companies. Vpon euery particular Branch, is bestowed the Armes of some One of the Twelue, exprest in the True Cullors within a faire shield. The highest Branch of all (as ouer-topping the Rest at This Time) bearing the Armes of the Skinners in a more large and glorious Escuchion. Among the Leaues in the Top, is a Tablet, in which is written, in letters of gold, Viutte Concordes, Liue in Loue: or Agree in one. Ouer the Person, Representing London, is likewise Inscribed in golden Capitals, This, Me Cunctus Lauro perducit ad astra Triumphus. Each Triumph Crown'd with Bayes, Mee to the Starres does raize. In places conuenient, and in a Triangular forme, vnder the twelue branches of the Tree, are seated Minerua, (Inuentresse and Patronesse of Artes, Handy-crafts, and Trades) in Ornaments proper to her quality: And not farre from her, is Bellona goddesse of VVarre, in a Martiall habit, on her head a Helme and Plume, and in her hands a golden Speare and Shield, with Medusaes head. Heereby intimating, that both Artes and Armes, are (in a high degree and fulnesse of honor,) nurc'd vp and maintain'd by and in the City: And, that either of them flourish brauely vnder the shaddow and protection of the twelue Branches, shooting forth from that. New Troy's Tree of Honor. Vpon a border of Flowers, inclosing this Tree, are fitly bestowed the Armes of as many of the inferior Companies in lesse Escucheons, as for the quantity of roome, can there be hansomely placed. VVithin the same Border, (where lesse Trees also grow) are presented Peace, Religion, Ciuill Gouernment, Iustice, Learning, Industry, and close to Industry, Honor. For as all these are golden Columnes, to beare vp the Glories of the City, so is the City an indulgent and carefull Mother, to bring vp them to their Glories. And as these twelue Noble Branches couer these Persons, (as it were with the wings of Angels,) so the Persons watch day and night to defend the twelue Branches. These Persons are adorned fitting their state and condition, and hold such properties in their hands, as of right belong vnto them. 1. Peace hath a Doue on her fist, and a Palme-tree Branch in her hand. 2. Religion is in a white glittering roabe, with a Coronet of Starres on her head, holding in one hand, a Booke open, in the other, a golden ladder, (embleme of prayer, by whose steppes wee climbe to Heauen.) 3. Ciuill Gouernment is in a roabe full of eyes, and a Dyall in her hand to expresse her Vigilance: For shee must watch euery houre, and keepe all eyes open, yet all little enough. 4. Iustice holds a Sword. 5. Learning a Booke, and a Iacobs Staffe. 6. Industry, a golden Hammer, and a Sea-mans Compasse, as taking paines to get wealth, both by Sea and Land. 7. Honor sits in Scarlet. The Person, in whom is figured London, is the speaker, who thus salutes his Lordship. Ten thousand welcomes Greete you on the shore, (My long expected PrÃ¦tor,) O before You looke on Others, fixe your eyes on Mee, On Mee, your second Mother, (London.) Shee Whom all Great Brittaines Citties, stile their Queene, For still I am, and haue her Darling beene. The Christian World, in Me, reads Times best stories, And Reading, fals blind at my dazling Glories, But now the Snow of age, couers my head: As therefore you, by Mee haue vp bin bred, You (Sir) must Nurse me now: With a quicke eye View then my Tree of Honor, branching high For hundreds of past yeares, with 12. large Stems, Twelue Noble Companies, which like 12. Iems So shine, they adde new Sun beames to the Day: Guard all these 12. maine-Boughes; but you must lay: A soft hand, on the Topping-branch, for there (Thriue the Roote well) your Selfe grows al this yeare: The lesser twigges which lowly runne along My tall Tree, Border, you must shield from wrong, There the poore Bee, (the sweating Trades-man) flies From Flower to Flower, and home with Honey hyes. With me Minerua, and Bellona come, For Artes and Armes, must at your Board haue roome, Your Gates will spred, the Rich to entertaine, But whilst the Mighty ones within remaine, And feast: Remember at the same Gate stands The Poore, with crying Papers in their hands, To watch when Iustice vp the Glasse shall turne, Let those sands runne, the Poore can neuer mourne. Place in your eyes two Beacons, to descry Dangers farre off, which strike ere home they flie; Kisse Peace; let Order euer steere the Helme, Left-handed Rule, a State does ouer-whelme. You are your Soueraignes Gardner for one yeare, The Plot of Ground, y'are trusted with, lies here, (A Citty,) and your care must all bee spent, To prune aud and dresse the Tree of Gouernment. Lop off Disorders, Factions, Mutiny, And Murmurations against those sit high, May your yeares last day, end as this beginnes, SphÃ¦r'd in the loues of Noble Citizens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our third presentation is call'd, The Glory of Furres. This is a Chariot Triumphant, garnished with Trophies of Armors. It is drawne by two Luzernes, The Supporters of the Skinners Armes. On the two Luzernes ride two Antickes, who dance to a Drum beating before them, there aptly placed. At the vpper end of this Chariot, in the most eminent Seate, carrying the proportion of a Throne, are aduanced a Russian Prince and Princesse; richly habited in Furres, to the custome of the Country. 1. Vnder them, sits an old Lord, Furred vp to his chin in a short cloake. 2. By him, a Lady with Martin skinnes about her necke, and her hands in a Muffe. 3. Then, a Iudge in Robes Furred. 4. Then, an Vniuersity Doctor, in his Robes furred. 5. Then, a Frow in a short furred Cassocke, girt to her. 6. Then a Skipper in a furred Cap. In all these Persons, is an implication of the necessary, ancient, and general vse of Furres, from the highest to the lowest. On the Top of this Throne, (at the foure corners) are erected the Armes of the Citty, in foure Pendants: On the point of the sore front, a large square Banner plaies with the wind, which Fame (who is in this Chariot,) holds in her hand, as she stands vpright, Being the Speaker. Fame. Fame's turne is now to Speake; for who but Fame Can with her thousand Tongues abroad Proclaime, Your this dayes Progresse (rising like the Sunne,) Which through the yearely Zodiacke on must runne. Fame hath brought hither from great Mosco's Court, (The seauen-mouth'd Volga, spreading the report,) Two Russian Princes, who to feast their eies, With the rich Wonders of these rarities, Ride in this glorious Chariot; How amazde They looke, to see streetes throng'd, and windowes glaz'd With beauties, from whose eyes such beames are sent, Here moues a second starry Firmament. Much, on them, startling admiration winnes, To see these Braue, Graue, Noble Citizens, So stream'd in multitudes, yet flowing in State, For all their Orders are Proportionate. Russia, now enuies London, seeing (here) spent Her richest Furres, in gracefull ornament, More Braue, and more Abounding, than her owne: A golden Pen he earnes, that can make knowne The vse of Furres, so Great, so Generall, All men, may these, their VVinter Armors call. Th'inuention of warme Furres the Sunne did fret, For Russians lap'd in these, slighted his heate, Which seene, his fiery Steedes he droue from thence, And so the Muss has dwelt in cold ere since. VVhat royalties, adde Furres to Emperors, Kings, Princes, Dukes, Earles, in the distinguishings, Of all their seuerall Robes? The Furres worne here, Aboue th'old Romane State make Ours appeare: The reuerend Iudge, and all that climbe the trees Of sacred Artes, ascend to their Degrees, And by the colours chang'd of Furres are knowne: VVhat Dignity, each Corporation Puts on by Furres, witnesse these infinite eyes, Thanke then the bringers of these Rarities. I wish (Graue PrÃ¦tor) that as Hand in Hand, Plenty and Bounty bring you safe to Land, So, Health may be chiefe Caruer at that Board, To which you hasten. Bee as Good a Lord I'th'eyes of Heauen, as this day you are Great In Fames applause: Hye to your Honor'd Seate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fourth Presentation is Called Brittania's Watch-Tower. This is a Magnificent Structure, Aduancing it selfe from the Platforme, or Ground-worke vpward, with the Bewty of eight Antique Termes, By whose strength is supported a Foure square Building; The Toppe of which is a Watch-Tower, or Lanthorne, with eight Columnes of siluer: And, on the Highest poynt of this Watch-Tower, is Aduanced a Banner, bearing the Cullors of the Kingdome. At foure Corners of the vpper Square, stand foure Pendants; In which are the Armes of the foure Companies of which his Lordship is Free. At rach end of this Platforme, stands a great Corynthian Brazen Pillar, on a Pedestall of Marble. On the Capitals of those Pillars; stand two Angels, in Postures ready to flye: holding Garlands of Victory in one hand, stucke with White and Red Roses, and Branches of Palme in the other. The Capitals and Bases of the Pillars are Gold, and are Emblemes of the two Houses of Yorke and Lancaster; once diuided, but now Ioyned into One Glorious Building, to Support This Royal Kingdom, &amp; Consequently This Citty. At Night, in place of the Angels, are set two Great Lights: and so is the Watch-Tower at that Time, Filld with lighted Tapers. Vpon the same Square, in foure seuerall Places, are Aduanced foure stately Pyramides, being Figures, of the foure Kingdomes Embellished with Escutcheons. In the vpper seate of all (fashioned into a Throne) is placed Britannia, Maiestically attirde, fitting to her Greatnesse. Beneath Her, and round about Her, are these Petsons: viz. Magnanimity with a drawne Sword. A Shipwright with a Mallet, holding a Scutcheon, in which is drawne a Ship vnder sayle. Then, A person representing Victory, with a Palme Tree. Prouidence with a Trumpet, ready to Foresee Dangers, and awaken Men to meete them. All These haue bene, and still are, Watch-Towers, and Lanthornes, in the Nighrs of Feare and Trouble, to Guard the Kingdome, and in the Kingdome, This Citty. In other Eminent places are seated some of those Kinges of England (in Robes Ermynd) whose loues and Royall fauors, in former times were Watch-Towers to Grace London, stucke full with the Beames and Lights of Honors, Titles, Offices, Magistracies and Royalties, which they Bestowed vppon Her. Edward Confessor, called Londons Chiefe Ruler, a Port-reue. Richard 1. appointed two Bayliffes ouer London. King Iohn gaue the Citty a Lord Maior and two Sheriffes. Henry 3. added Aldermen. These were Tender ouer the Renowne of the Citty, and still heaped on her head, Royalties vpon Royalties. And albeit most of our Kinges, haue in most of all of the twelue Companies, Entred their Names, as Free of the Societies, thereby to Royallize their Brotherhoods: And that many of our Kinges likewise, besides Princes and Great Personages, haue bin Free of This Company, whose Names I forbeare to set downe, because they haue in former yeeres beene fully exprest: yet no Company, did euer, or can hereafter, receiue such Graces from Kinges, as This Antient, and Honord Corporation of Skinners, hath had, and still haue, In regard that All our Kinges and Princes, sit in their high Courts of Parliament in Robes Ermynd, (being the richest Furre) the workemanship of which goes through the Skinners fingers, wearing likewise vnder their Crownes, Royall Caps of Honor Ermynd. Three of such Crownes, beeing the rich Armes of This Company, thereby expressing aswell their Honor, as Antiquity. Britannia deliuers thus much. Shall the Proud wife of Neptune, or shrill Fame, Or Troynouant her selfe, Ring out your Name: And I be Dumbe, or sparing, to Sound high, The Glories of This Day? No, They shall Fly Like Soaring Eagles, to That Curled Maine Whose Head my Rocky Bridle, In does Reyne: The Great Britannia, Bred you in her Wombe, Heare then a Mothers Counsell; You are Come Aboard a Goodly Ship, where all your State, Fame, Honor and Renowne (Imbarqu'd) must waite The voyage of twelve Moones. High Admirall You are to All That Fleete, which Thus you Call To sayle in This vast Ocean. Nor must you Walke Heartlesse on the Hatches, Theres a New State-Nauigation, to be studied Now, With an High rear'd, Vndanted, Fixed Brow. Be sure to haue Braue Ordnance, and chargd well; In this your Ship, Trust None, For Officers Sell Their Captaines Trust; let None but your owne Eyes, Rule Chart and Compasse, There your Safety lyes. Your Owne Hands steere the Helme, But strongly Steere, And spite of stormes, be stoute when you stand There. Embleme of Mercy! Your Keene sword does sleepe, But why a Sword, if not to Kill, and Keepe Vices (like Slaues) in Awe? Fulnesse of Wine Is a Fowle Dropsie, That and Lust Entwine: Pride a swolne Timpany, Sloth, the Beggars Goute, (In Tradesmens Hands and Feete, It runnes about,) No Cure for this! Oathes thicke as Small-shot flye From Children, No Defence to Put this by! You May, you Must. I Counsell not, but Reade A Lesson of my Loue; By which Loue led Ile on, and Bring you to your Honord Chaire, Whilst Aues (Round about you) Dance i'th' Aire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Last Presentation is called the Sun's Bower. The vpper part of this, is adorned with seuerall Flowers, which interwouen together, dresse vp a comely Greene Arbor, in which the Sunne sits, with golden Beames about his Face; an Attire glittering like gold; and a mantle bright as his garment, fringed with gold, his haire curled and yellow. About him are placed, Spring, Summer, Autumne, and Winter, in proper Habiliments. Beneath these, is a VVildernesse, in which are many sorts of such Beasts, whose rich Skinnes serue for Furres: As the Beare, Wolfe, Leopard, Luzerne, Cat-A-Mountaine, Foxes, Sables, Connies, Ferrets, Squirrels, &amp;c. Of these Beasts, some are climbing, some standing, some grinning, with liuely, naturall postures. In a Scrole, hanging on a Bough, This is Written in Capitall letters. Deus ecce Furentibus obstat. See, for all some Beasts are fell, There's one, that can their curstnesse quell. Sol is the Speaker. Heauens bright Orientall Gates I op'd this Morne, And Hither wheeld my Chariot to adorne These splendors with my Beames: nere did the Sun In his CÃ¦lestiall Circle faster runne Than Now, to see these Sightes: O how I ioy To view a Kingdome, and a New-built Troy So flourishing so full, so faire, so deare To th'Gods: they leaue Ioue's Court to reuell here. All o're the VVorld, I trauell in one Day, Yet oft am forc'd to leaue my beaten way, Frighted with Vproares, Battailes, Massacres, Famines, and all that Hellish brood of Warres: I meete no Peace but here. O blessed Land! That seest fires kindling round, and yet canst stand Vnburnt for all their flames; O Nation blest! VVhen all thy Neighbours shrike, none wound thy brest. To Crowne these ioyes, with me are come along, The foure Lords of the yeare, who by a strong Knit Charme, bring in this goodly Russian prize, As earnest of a more rich Merchandize: Halfe of our Race, Time, and my Houres haue runne, Nor shall they giue o're till the Goale be wonne. The Sunne at Night being couered with a vaile of Darknesse: The Person, representing London, thus takes leaue. The Sunne is mantled in thicke Clouds of Blacke, And by his hidden Beames, threatens the wracke Of all these Glories: Euery pleasure dyes VVhen Rauen-winged Night, from her Caue flyes; None but these Artificiall Starres keepe fire To Light you Home, these burne with a desire To lengthen your braue Triumphes; but their heate Must coole, and dye at length, tho ne're so Great. Peace therefore guide you on: Rest, charme your eyes, And Honors waite to cheere you when you Rise. [Inuentor.] Let it be no Ostentation in Me the Inuentor, to speak thus much in praise of the workes, that for many yeares, none haue beene able to Match them for curiosity: They are not Vast, but Neate, and Comprehend as much Arte for Architecture, as can be bestowed vpon such little Bodies. The commendations of which must liue vppon Mr. Gerard Chrismas the Father, and Mr. Iohn Chrismas the Sonne.</field>
