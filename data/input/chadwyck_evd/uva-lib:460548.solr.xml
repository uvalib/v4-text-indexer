Ras Walda Giorgis Ras Byzance's Friend, the favourite of Menelik's Court. Ras Mangasha Supposed lover of Ras Byzance's wife, Abenetah. The Affa Negus Lord Chief Justice of Ethiopia.

      <field name="fulltext">Scene: In or near Addis Ababa, the Capital of Ethiopia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Addis Ababa: Noon over sweeps of turf-land; on the horizon the mound of the King's House. In front, to the right, the wood-hut, withed and straw-roofed, of Ras Byzance; further back, to the left, the smaller hut of the women, surrounded by a gallery, that is reached by an outside stair-case of wood. A few warriors in white lie asleep where there is shade. From the women's hut a sound like that of an impeded stream is heard once or twice; then a muffled cry, as of the hyÃ¦na at night: after profound silence, Ras Byzance comes out on to the gallery and descends, his sword unsheathed, his face in sculpture under its auriole of lion's mane. He is dressed in white, with black silk cloak, a cross with a blue cord round his throat. From his right ear hangs a diamond that testifies he has killed elephants. RAS BYZANCE. Done! It is done! . . . And we had eaten of God's sacrament; The High Priest heard and through his ear God heard Our vows each to the other. She is there, And she is dead. . . . Thank God, who heard our vows! [He still holds his sword and bends his head; raising it after a while.] So purged the air is when a dust-storm strikes, And, having struck, departs: so came, so goes This punishment, fallen by the power of God. The sun unveiled! My thoughts firm . . . Why then, with my thoughts thus firm, Should I be trembling and my brow so damp, Damp as my sword? [He unbinds the white scarf tied round his head beneath the lion-auriole and wipes his forehead.] And now the sword! . . . [He wipes it on the white scarf.] Slip back To thy red scabbard, my clean weapon; rest! Thou hast done righteousness. Take now thy rest. [He wipes his forehead again.] Ha! . . . But her blood! I had forgotten it . . . Awayâher blood, her false, polluted blood To touch my forehead with its heinous mark! Away! [He flings his scarf behind his hut, and wipes his forehead with his black cloak.] Now, by the death of Menelik, I swear I will not enter by one thought That dwelling-place of Judgment, where is laid The quarry of to-day. Is it not easy To breathe the air and wander in the mind These rolling uplands, free To flocks of thoughts? I never saw so clearly The King's house, nor so clear The little, ancient church of my espousals Before me at Entotto, . . . nor the roofs Of all the countryside . . . Ras Michael's roofsâ The high one, and the lower one, where dwells Weletemaskel, his much-honoured wife And her hand-maidens . . . No, no! I am free To wander in my thoughts over the grass, Over the grassland to the Herrer Mountains, Where I once killed a lion and won his mane As auriole . . . on to Mount Manigashi, Where I first killed an elephant and won The diamond trophy for my ear . . . or further To where due south the monastery lies, Beside a lake, where I was taught my prayers, Under Zukala's clambering heights. . . . [Turning again to the spot from whence he had begun to sweep the horizon.] Thy palace!â O Lion of Judah, sprung from Soloman, Sprung from the Queen of Sheba, Menelik, The King of Kings . . .and all these clustered roofs, Where dwell my fifteen thousand braves, the men I draw by rule and influence to aid him In his vast hope and vast enlightenment! . . . Is not this full enough of life to hinder All thinking back on what has been of woe? Ah, thou wilt comprehend; thou hast thy wife, Our honoured Queen, the honoured TaÃ¯tu, O King! . . . The stillness of my huts! As tiny craft upon a broken sea . . . And my own hut . . . and hers! Now the dogs bark, And guests are coming hither. [A few of the warriors roll over and look up.] Sleep your sleep! Friends!âHis dear Highness Ras Walda Giorgis . . . with her brother? Ah! . . . The Ras Tasanna . . . And he laughs, laughs loud. [Enter Ras Walda Giorgis and Ras Tasanna. They all touch hands.] Be welcome! RAS WALDA GIORGIS. From the King of Kings, we come. He prays of you to guard the foreigner Bridging the gorge of Hawash. Stay, dear Highness, Has ill befallen you? Or the crazy Demon BoÃ¶da entered you? Does not his Highness Look strange? RAS TASANNA. Why are you here alone, if ill? Or has the mood grown up too suddenly For any aid? These fiendish visitations Come pell-mell on the brain. RAS BYZANCE. Why should you thus Consign me to the fiend? RAS WALDA GIORGIS. But you look strange, Belovedâ RAS BYZANCE. Noon, noon!â Speak to me plainer of the requisition The King of Kings has made on me. You saidâ To guard the French adviser of the King From here to Hawash Gorge? Yes, I have round me My complement of troops, and will give order To my Gerazmach for the escort. Enter! RAS TASANNA. No, brother, no! You and his Highness Walda Giorgis hold Discourse of the last scandal of our Court, Or vaunt your praises of the foreigner, Or speak of wires that bear the voice of men Further than any winds the lion's roar, The bellow of the elephant . . . these marvels, This telephone and these unhallowed engines Of magic that the Son of Judah dares To take to his command. Boast as you will Of your new ways; while from the gallery I wake my sister, chide her indolence. . . . You have been easy to Abenetahâ Nothing to do but broiderâor to bar Her locks with Indian oils through plaits of marvel; She rubs her skin with rose, or cinnamon, Or nutmeg . . . Then how slow She fills the foreign glass upon her table With marigolds above the coffee-draught; Or lies asleep, a chetah, in the noon. You have been easy, Byzance, to your bride. I shall call Fie! and wake her. [He ascends to the gallery, pauses by the half-open door and calls out]. Fie, Fie, Fie! Fie, fie, Abenetah! Wake up, come forth! [Ras Byzance drops his hand on his sword.] RAS WALDA GIORGIS. Dear, you will join me early when we ride Out to Entotto for St. Ragual's Feast? We must ride earlier than the King of Kings To meet him, for you know he rides betimes, Is ever earlier than the hour of Time; For he is greater than its lapse, and solid To lead it forward to his will or motion. Do not be late! RAS BYZANCE. But how he has wide sight, Our Lord of Victory! O friend, How the white alien trembles at his name And the dire name Adowa, name of greatness, That cleansed in blood our country from a foreign, Contaminating stain! RAS WALDA GIORGIS. How vehement, dear Highness, vehement! But all we warriors, from our feet to throat, Would dance and shout the gloryâwould we not?â Of Ethiopia and our Menelik. RAS TASANNA. [At the door.] Fie, fie, wake up, Abenetah, wake up! Ha, ho! wake up, come forth, Abenetah! Women, wake up, arouse your mistress, wake! RAS WALDA GIORGIS. Are they not precious sleepers, these fine women, Who have their leisure and desire in all? Ha, ha! Oh, what a figure Ras Tasanna makes, Imploring like a loverâho! [He laughs in peals.] She will not come? We shall not see the women Stand on the stairs, a long line of white lilies Up a steep cliffâHo, ho! They will not come. She will not come. [Ras Tasanna laughs back.] RAS BYZANCE. Demons! How long, how slow! RAS WALDA GIORGIS. What are you angry? Let us jest to-day And laugh!âYour eyes . . . they are not as your eyes Sharp as in fight. RAS TASANNA. Abenetah! [He looks round the half-opened door impatiently, then mutters, then enters the hut, calling.] All is not well! Come in! All is not well. RAS WALDA GIORGIS. But what has happened? Come! RAS BYZANCE. [Holding his friend's cloak.] Nor you nor I will enter. All is well. RAS TASANNA. [In a shriek from within.] My sister. . . . Oh, she's dead, she's lying murdered. . . . My sister and her women murdered with her! My sister, my Abenetahâmy sister! RAS BYZANCE. [With a smile.] You are my friend . . . 'tis true! By right of friendship you should know the first. RAS WALDA GIORGIS. Highness, and all this while. . . . Yesus, this while! RAS BYZANCE. Yes, she and her six women in the sunâ There for the light to see, their faces turned For the full light to reach them, while they lie Motionless in the scorching gaze of day: Seven faces in one condemnation bare. RAS WALDA GIORGIS. You did this, Highness? RAS TASANNA. [Descending from the gallery.] No-one comes My sister murdered and no feet run hither; Her husband stands as I had said a dog Had died among the mules. . . . [He totters to Ras Byzance and whispers in his ear.] Abenetah Is dead. . . . [He sinks down, his head on his knees.] And, Cross of Yesus, no-one speaks. RAS BYZANCE. [Above Ras Tasanna's head.] She is, as is the leafless tree Of the Salilmah, all her flowers are faded In all their perfect loveliness at noon: For she was leafless and at noon is dead. RAS TASANNA. My sister . . . no one came, and no one spoke, And then her husband with aspersing breath Bows over me! [Springing up.] Dead! Dead! But she is murdered! And he who murdered her, if her own father, Should prove the cause for which he murdered her. RAS BYZANCE. Highness, she played the harlot; she was false . . . Oh, how she gathered on the day and night The load of her pollution, till the night, That but endures, gave up to active day The task of loosening the vile burthen down! RAS TASANNA. My sister vile and an adulteress! With whom? RAS BYZANCE. The Ras Mangasha. RAS TASANNA. That youth, her cousin, and my closest friend? The Ras Mangasha? RAS BYZANCE. Yes. RAS TASANNA. I will be sworn my friend is innocent. RAS BYZANCE. Ay, as the fat, white snakes upon the desert, That in three minutes kill, but hide from sunrise, And disappear. . . . RAS TASANNA. O fool! RAS BYZANCE. Ever beside her, ever on her lips, Ever removing from my huts as soon As I approached them, ever with my guests And at my table, ever when I travelled At home with her . . . and all my joy put out! Had I not slept in peace 'neath her caresses, As sleeps the bull-rhinoceros, while round him The cloud, the host of variegated birds Is at its vigil to awake him, rouse him, Should peril neighbour them; and I had trusted Her graces, all her shining waysâa fool! Silent, she gave no warning, let the trapper Come on me, shamed me, and delivered me A prey to Ras Mangasha. RAS TASANNA. You shall 'stablish Before the King of Kings your accusation Against the Ras Mangasha, and shall answer For this fell murder to the uttermost. With me is vengeance for that lovely one, Laid terrible before me, with closed eyes And open lips. . . . Unhappy sister, severed From life in morning flower! If I can stretch you, Even as she lies, in blood upon the earth, Our King of Kings will not in vain have ruled, The laws of Ethiopia be not vain. I go to pray the King of Kings for judgment. Go you into your women's house, go in! You will see judgment with your naked sightâ Let that suffice until my naked sword Shall make you know my vengeance to the hilt. [He unsheathes his sword and waves it back toward the women's house. Warriors of Ras Byzance, with swords and rifles, have gathered round threateningly.] RAS BYZANCE. Place for his Highness Ras Tasannaâshoot Who dare or do offence! [Ras Tasanna goes out.] RAS WALDA GIORGIS. O friend, my dear, but did she truly sin? You know she sinned, if you have done this deed? RAS BYZANCE. Would she not chaunt for me AdÃ´n, AdÃ´n, Adoshava in pride that I had killed A lion and wore his glory for my crownet âThe women's song AdÃ´n Adoshava, Sing day by day AdÃ´n? Mangasha had but speared a lioness through Till yesterday, when he brought home from hunting A feeble, grizzled lion, and in my house She hummed AdÃ´n, AdÃ´n, Adoshava, Low and contented as the desert-bee In honey to the full of appetiteâ A Wandatch bee in spring . . . Each hum made keen my sword-blade to deliver My ears from that redoubling monotone, More hideous than the foeman's cannonade When the invader came to strike our land. He came in vain . . . and would I bear that soundâ That dispossession of her voice, her lips, Her secret bosom, nor draw forth the sword, Nor flash it as a victor? . . . How she hummed AdÃ´n, AdÃ´n, Adoshavaâas happy As nurslings that draw milk; so low, so inward Upon her heart, as fed! Not to the braves, Not to the guests as when she chaunted me, And played with flame-eyes round my aureole To which all eyes were turned as to a fire . . . Not so . . . . but to herself she sang AdÃ´n She cannot any more. Is she not dead? . . . Where is her voice? She will not hear her voiceâ Nor I . . . Upon her wanton breath no mad, droned music, Nor on her lips, her love, indulging them! RAS WALDA GIORGIS. Woe for the day that brought you to this deed! RAS BYZANCE. No woe, but clear thanksgiving she is dead. Did we not shout out as the alien yielded Before us, shout round the great heavens and dance Across the free grass of our happy country Clean from our foe, ourselves executors Of vengeance on the curse fallen in our bounds? So I rejoiceâimmeasurably triumph. RAS WALDA GIORGIS. Woe on the day!â RAS BYZANCE. His eyes, her eyesâthe kisses in their eyes! She had forgotten me, As I were laid a corpse upon a mat Along my shallow grave, lost, covered up By her entangling smiles for him, her riot Of laughter, and her glances and her gaze; My resting-place beneath them lost, gone, gone, That none should know I lived, and once had gathered All the abundance of her face as mine, My gardenâall her face. RAS WALDA GIORGIS. Woe on the day You married her with God's own sacrament! RAS BYZANCE. She darkened heaven and she made the earth Foul as an empty torrent. Do you think I did not love her, Walda Giorgis, love her? Why, she has turned my heart Into a lonely cistern of the hills, Where none will ever drink, where the wild foxes And murderous wild-dogs cluster for their life, Fighting around the water from the rock, From the bare rock; and none of human kind Will pierce the savage guard nor drink the treasure. 'Tis so I loved her . . . I can see her laid Within there, as I left her; on her bosom Huge circles of her coral; on her throat And robe such splashes as the red of pods On sarmon-trees, or coffee in the husk, Or the red bats and tassels of mimosa Hanging like ear-rings down, the red in splashes; And she laid, brown and white, upon her blood, Laid on it, as an Indian carpet, laid So deeply still and peaceful on her blood. Go, Walda Giorgis, to the King of Kings; Tell him she sinned, tell him I will be judged. Kiss me, Ras Walda Giorgis, if my friend. [They embrace.] Go to the King of Kings! I go within My women's house . . . I dare. And I will go. What I shall see is well: what I left there Was well and I shall recognise my act. Adieu!âMy Cause! [Ras Walda Giorgis passes the saluting warriors. Ras Byzance shuts behind him the door of the women's house.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Addis Ababa. The Sagonet, where the King sits in judgment. Upon a dais hung with silk and carpets, under a canopy covered with black satin and little tongueless silver bells, King Menelik is seated on embroidered cushions. His white dress is almost hidden under a purple cloak, silver-broidered, his head is bound in white, fastened with long sea-blue ribbons. He wears a cross round his neck. His red umbrella of state is held over him. Behind him are Rases and Generals, mostly in white, with red-edged shammas and capes of various skins, lion, leopard: on his right The Abuna in black and violet robes; on the left, Princes of the Royal household, one young Prince swaying a fly-whisk. In front of him stands the Affa Negus. Ras Walda Giorgis leans on the dais. MENELIK. We are forward in our coming, and the hour Yet lags behind. THE AFFA. But sooner than the hour, O King of Kings, Complainant and defendant will approach. Men may come slower than the sovereign judge; Yet judgment draws them, as abounding ocean Draws to its presence undistracted rivers Upon the stretch of their necessity. MENELIK. Well is it spoken. So Is judgment as a power that must avail. . . . [To The Abuna.] Before it, O Beatitude, ourself Feels but as one who tarries to be judged. THE ABUNA. The Lord be with you! Even before His power Are Kings in humbleness as men before The sacred domination of a King. MENELIK. But if the burthened heart would countervail, And is not level in capacity With sanction of the judgment-seatâah, then! . . . The Ras Tasanna comes. [He slightly bows as Ras Tasanna salaams, also Ras Mangasha among the witnesses, who are marshalled by the Agafari (Doorkeeper).] RAS TASANNA. Not here! THE AFFA. Ras Byzance now is at the door. Open the door and hasten, Agafari. RAS TASANNA. But late! Assassin! Slow to show his face. THE AFFA. He comes, nor is the hour complete: he comes Scarcely behind you, who are pricked with anger, And active as a bridegroom is for love, Through violence of the opposite of loveâ Hate, punctual goad, your Highness. He is here. [Enter Ras Byzance, with several followers. He salaams to the King. Discovering he has placed himself near Ras Mangasha he moves further away.] MENELIK. Complainant and defendant and all those Who shall bear witness, are they now assembled? THE AFFA. All are within the Sagonet and ready. MENELIK. [With a wave of his hand toward the Affa.] He who is justice in our land, the breath Even of the body of the State, ourself, Has gathered from all quarters to our knowledge The circumstance on which denunciation As murderer of his sisterâall is known. We therefore ask no teaching or recital Of certainties: the deed was surely done For which Ras Byzance stands before us. Speak, Why you dispute this husband's chastisement Of one who was his wife, and was of him Esteemed adulterous? Ras Tasanna, speak! RAS TASANNA. O conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, And of our God appointed King of Kings, I plead for one who was most innocent, My father's daughter of his very blood, Not by adoption, of his own begetting, Abenetah, my sister from the womb That bore me to my father, in true marriage, Blessed by the Church, vowed by God's sacrament. I stand here, brother of Abenetah, And for her innocence. Great King, I will not speak of her as to myself She showed in life: a brother may be partial Towards those perfections of so close a strain They are to him as flowers are to the leaves Upon a parent-stem,âtheir neighbourhood Being not of chance but breed. . . . Before this Court, Before the light of Ethiopia, King, I speak from testimony and pluck out My own eyes from my plea. But at my side, These men who have been visitant with me How often to her husband, and these men Of his who have been present, noon and evening About her hut, swear they have never seen, Nor ever heard what could bring shame on her And on my friend from childhood, my companion, The Ras Mangasha. More than this, behold The Ras Mangasha at my side to swear He never knew this murderer's wife, nor ever Spoke with her otherwise than as my friend, Familiar since the days when with shrill voice She called us in from wrestling or from riding The mules and horses, we could scarcely hold With such small hands, or quite defeated us In battles by her generous shout, our dinner Lightly prepared by her small hands, was set. Hear Ras Mangasha! And then give this man, Assassin of my sister, to the sword Of her avenger, her one brother's sword. THE AFFA. Come forward, Ras Mangasha; swear true witness. RAS MANGASHA. Yea, by the death of Menelik I swear, Nor could more solemn oath attest me true, Before the very face of Menelikâ I never had that converse with his wife This man would blot me with; nor ever used her Save almost as the brother of her brother In faithful amity. [To Ras Byzance.] I never touched Your wife unlawfully that you should name me The pivot of your murder, and should drag One, whose due place is by his King, before His King, accused, in shadeâ I say, Ras Byzance, I am wronged, as she Your wife is wronged, who now can never feel Joyance when such detraction drops its lie. RAS BYZANCE. All men, the true, the criminal, O King, Swear by thy death, all-conquering Menelik, Taking thy name in vain, O Menelik! Forgive another oath! [To Ras Mangasha.] Swear by those eyes Now sealed, and let the truth Be as the ripe, dry grain, closed down in pits And over-grown, for which as for pure water We sound the earthâyea, let those eyes of hers, That once were stayed on yours, now sound your eyes, To find you did not love her. RAS MANGASHA. [Lifting his black cloak between himself and Ras Byzance.] Oh, by those Sealed eyes of hers, we did commit against you No crime, Ras Byzance. RAS BYZANCE. By her eyes? RAS MANGASHA. No crime, Ras Byzance! RAS BYZANCE. By her eyes, The truth is that you loved; the truth is there, The grains of truth are there. RAS MANGASHA. I never wronged you. RAS BYZANCE. No, by the death of Menelik, you swear it . . . And, by her eyes, I swear you did the wrong. . . . O Lion of Judah, sweet was her new love So short while since, when she and I together Were homed as one within my province, sweet As honey-comb of Lasta, full of honey Fed on white heath and white . . . We often sat On a cliff's edge and watched the honey-bees Come up from the warm valley to the downs After their flowers, backward and forward coming, And rising from the valley and then shutting Their wings for rapid fall upon their hives Down in the valley; and I thought my days Were as their days; I drank of hydromel Free as the breath of life, the living air. Why was I hurried to the congregation Of the massed Ethiop troops in war-array, Commanded by yourself? Why did I house My treasure on the peaceful field to lose her, Torn from me by this perjured man, as false To me as to her brother? . . . Swift as snow, That lights down on the mountains of our land, And then is gone away from us, so swift Her love and her fidelity were goneâ And she, being gone from me, had left, it seemed, Her shadow; or at times when most her treason Wrought in me, but a body where nought lived. How should I bear or wraith or sullen body; Sometimes a spectre, sometimes heated clay, A horror and a loathing through the hours? All was at end . . . I killed her As simply as we kill an animal, Take it and turn to it Jerusalem, And, in the Virgin Maryam's holy name, Strike with our knife . . . All was at end! My days Dazzled and sad and growing impotent. They say that those who watch chameleons change Their colour will most certainly go blind: I watched her change and vary to his moods, To her own moods, as he was simply loved, Then was longed after, then adored . . . Oh, purple! O flame, O red of heavy passion!âI With growing blackness on me all the day, And double blackness on me all the night! I to grow blind and perish, I the chief, The guide of fifteen thousand braves, grow powerless, And be forgotten and forget! . . . Know that when once a woman at his side Turns a man's life infectious he is altered From all the light and strength of his estate, As those who fall blind. This adultery! It is the greatest sin in all the world, And may not be forgiven. RAS TASANNA. But prove the sin, Prove that my sister was a harlot, prove it! RAS BYZANCE. All was at end. . . . RAS TASANNA. O blinded! Purblindânot from her turns, her changefulness, But from your veering jealousies, your brood Of ever-divers, alterable doubts . . . These left you blinded. MENELIK. Highness, Make good your accusation of this man. What have you seen with your own eyes, what heard With your own ears to justify the deed? RAS BYZANCE. I told you, King of Kings, she turned from me. All was at end! Were her looks ever on me? And she chaunted AdÃ´n, AdÃ´n, Adoshava for himâ. RAS TASANNA. For any of the braves who kill a lion. RAS BYZANCE. Low on her voice For him! . . . That female chaunt, like a wind sweeping The dark and lowered heavens, uplifted me To God's celestial armoury, a chamber Where His keen weapons flash . . . and in their flashing I bent above the face that I adored, Above a mouth that once spoke words of loveâ Only the words of loveâand I beheld The face and mouth, as if I sank in space Beneath the sight . . . till a bare weapon flashed; And heaven was with me. RAS TASANNA. Is this proof, O King? MENELIK. It is not proof. . . . Consider, Lay by your passion, take to thought your peril. Highness Ras Byzance, have you ever found This man among your women in their hut, Or leaving it at risen dawn, or couched Unlawfully with her who was your wife? RAS TASANNA. The women of her tendance would have guarded With their linked oaths their mistress at this hour Of imputation, had they lived, nor met With her they served a lion's savageness. Her six maid-servants lay dead. RAS BYZANCE. 'Complices In her empestering, base adulteryâ Swept dead by heaven's bright sword, dead round the room. MENELIK. Peace, peace! Consider, Highness; You have not fed our judgment with one proof Bear out your sure conviction, let surmise Show in effect and evidence authentic. Consider, Highness! RAS TASANNA. Proof! The deed was of his murderous passion done. MENELIK. Consider Highness! THE AFFA. We await Avouchment of that crime that struck your honour; The circumstance and the discovery. RAS BYZANCE. I have not seen, I have not heardâ No one gross moment gave me sight or hearing. Day came and filled my eyes with her rejection Of me from her desire; night folded us Together in one cloak, as if no more We were of kind. You ask me for a proof More sureâand I declare there is no proof Save this alone, and what beyond even this, Seen in her senses, heard upon her voice, Sparkled and rose up to him. RAS TASANNA. Did you charge The Ras Mangasha to his face? RAS MANGASHA. [Unmuffling his face that has been half hidden in his cloak.] No, never! RAS BYZANCE. Mute is the dog that heads an antelope. THE AFFA. You must show proof Of the adulterous act. MENELIK. Consider, Highness! Consider! [There is silence for a moment.] THE AFFA. . . . King of Kings, Ras Byzance, fails In vindication of his bloody deed, The cause being barred, unproven, and of surmise. RAS TASANNA. Abenetah!âO King, the deed was murder, And I demand the utmost penalty: Sword-thrust for sword-thrust, as her death his death. [All groan.] THE AFFA. This cannot of our laws be disallowed. MENELIK. Highness Ras Byzanceâ. RAS BYZANCE. King! MENELIK. You have in rashness and in wrath unsheathed Your sword against this noble sister, shedding Her blood with steel, and for no cause the law Of Ethiopia sanctions or allows. Highness Ras Byzance, what your hand has done Against the statutes of our country dooms you: And for your death, You are delivered to the Ras Tasanna To perish at his hand by that same death You dealt his sisterâso our law condemns. [He covers his face with his flowered Eastern handkerchief] RAS BYZANCE. But I protest. . . . THE AFFA. Peace, peace! Do you not see the King of Kings would speak? MENELIK. [Dropping the handkerchief from his wet eyes.] Mercy, have mercy, Ras Tasanna, mercy! RAS BYZANCE. No, King of Kings! MENELIK. Have mercy, Ras Tasanna! I ask you, I the second Menelik, I that am here for Soloman, being son Of Hailo Melekot, in true descent From Menelik, the son of Soloman, And wise Nikaula, Queen of Sheba, I That am of that wise King and that wise Queen By veritable lineage, I implore Your mercy for this man, for this assassin; And by a wisdom drawn up from the tomb Of Soloman or from that native tomb Of Queen Nikaula, by a wisdom ripened Through nigh four thousand years, I supplicate That you release this young man from his death, And take blood-money as his sacrifice. RAS TASANNA. No, Majesty! MENELIK. Guard silence While your King's voice moves out to you. A jewel Of the blind darkness waiting for the light To whelm it from clear springs, so were this mercy Of the wise Jewish King, my ancestor . . . For see the wisdom! Can you by the death Of this most miserable, rash assassin Bring the beloved dead back? She is gone utterly, And all she might have been upon our earth Is abrogated: but this man stands here Among us, fifteen thousand warriors wait His guiding, his command; within his eyes Is light to urge them, on his lips the voice To pierce their ignorance; and here, enthroned, His King has need of himâthe valorous mind Seasoning to richer progress, the straight will Informed with pertinence. Our Country needs him; And he stands living in our midst. Have mercy, Wise mercy, Ras Tasanna! Let him live, Look at him . . . He is weeping. By God's gift To Soloman in youth, let the man live! RAS TASANNA. [Springing forward.] Do I then wear a sword upon my side? Not for the Ethiopian kingdom, King! You cannot feel; you have not been where I Am set by his offence. 'Tis not for me To judge; I have, committed to my sword, The wrath of all my line, the wrath of men And women far away, as thunder heard Among the storm-struck hills, that travels on With roar of many waters bubbling, hissing, Screaming and bearing down trees, Zarebas Of brambles, carcasses, while men in front, Planted where now is empty river-bed, Cry out âThe River Is come!â and with the roar of cannonade, Like an enormous snake, the flood appearsâ Such is my vengeance and my glittering sword. RAS MANGASHA. He killed her in her sleep. . . . RAS TASANNA. Yes, fast asleep! But she has wakened from that sleep, far off. Hark! . . . Where is desert, through long distances Men may converse unseen and far away . . . So comes faint echo from Abenetah Beyond her death to me, and she is heard More than the wrathful powers among the hills That urge my sword . . . O King, Had it been quarrel between living man And living man, at thy command alone, Without one intercession, all offences, As locusts killed by wind lie on the country, Should fall and be forgotten. King of Kings, I stand before you, hearing her and hearing All those from whom she drew her lineage forth, Yea, and all those who, murdered, pray requital . . . I hear . . . and I deny you, King of Kings. MENELIK. The Court is over. . . . Sentence passed. The man I sentence is beloved; therefore a day Or several days must pass to guard the city From strife or tumult at his execution; What day that shall be dealt we will appraise you, As it behoves us, Ras Tasanna. Now The Court is closed. . . . And clear it, Agafari! Stay, Affa, and, my body-guard, remain . . . And the condemned. [Ras Tasanna and Ras Mangasha salaam and depart in unbroken silence; outside is an outburst of groans and cries from the people. The Abuna departs; and the Agafari, with his olive-switch soon clears the Court.] [Menelik has risen and now leans on Ras Walda Giorgis and on his crutch of office. Ras Walda Giorgis is weeping aloud. Menelik speaks to Ras Byzance.] You are a prisoner now. You must give up your sword. [Ras Byzance ungirds his weapon.] At my request, Will you receive it, Affa, from his hand? The Affa bows.] It is its master's death. O Highness, Highness, I have been denied for you; in me your country, Even Ethiopia, has been denied. We cannot save your life: bear away with you Love and a sorrow as for living man, Not for the dead. . . . Come near! RAS BYZANCE. [Kneeling and throwing back his head.] She was as false as any of those women Their husbands kill, and, having killed, are free. She was all gone to him. . . . She was not mine, No more than now my sword. . . . O holy Michael, Saint George, Saint Gabriel, all is gone! MENELIK. Ras Byzance, Not love, your God-appointed Judge's love . . . I, Menelik, have been denied for you. Hush! You are broken. . . . We are here together As men among the boulders in sheer darkness: And we may fall and hurt each other, fall And hurt ourselves. . . . Farewell. See to it, Affa. That he is guarded here till in seclusion And cover of the night he be removed Safe to our Amba. In the name of God, And Maryam, the Queen of Heaven, farewell! [Menelik moves away; then suddenly whispers in his soft voice to Ras Walda Giorgis.] Go to your friend, beloved. [Ras Walda Giorgis runs to Ras Byzance, who is still kneeling with bowed head, and kneels by him; the two men are locked in embrace.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Country outside Addis Ababa, in the dusk before dawn. Two transverse slopes of bold open Down, sprinkled with stones and rocks: where the sweeps of rolling land cross, an aged Coptic Priest is setting up stones in a pile. Now and then he shakes his fly-whisk and leans on his crutch of office. He wears a light, yellow garment, a pointed turban and leather amulets on his arm. When he has piled some of the stones, he laboriously gathers more. By a rock lower down the slope a lad with shaved head, twangs a one-stringed instrument and wails a strange, piping song, as he stands on one leg. JOHANNES. Oh, oh, lu, lu! Oh, the Wise Men, On camels, mules, Laden with myrrh, Chetahs and tusks Of elephants wild, Journeying on Where in her hut Maryam sits, God on her knee! Oh, the Wise Men, Wise as our Queen, Leaving with gifts Sheba behind, Leaving the south For Soloman! Oh, oh, lu, lu! PRIEST. [Calling down the slope.] Youngster, come up here! We sing God manifest by and by. Put down your lyre and help me. Had God granted me to be young I had been able to carry bigger stones. . . . Come, your little hands to the work, and God is briskly served! JOHANNES. Father, I am sleepy, and while I thrum, and sing the Mages, I am almost asleep, in a morning sleep. To gather stones, big stones, is to be roused too early. PRIEST. Sluggard! Up, up! You rascal, up! Hang your lyre there, and tug with me at this stone. Ho! It moves, child! Hold it, in God's name! You are deep-chested and strong for a lad of your years. If God had granted me to be young I should have built His altar with none but these large stones: a handsome altar it had been. Those I built when I was young, scarcely older than youâcould you have seen them! . . . Beyond the memory of man a Priest has set an altar here on the Epiphany morning; but no priest of them all made a finer altar than I, when I was young . . . true to the circle. . . . And the stones!âWhy, child, I was a giant, I built as the men at Axum, God forgive them!âas the heathen who could lift huge boulders. . . . This one we are carryingâchild's play, child's play! But we must not talk, it spends our breath. . . . My altars when I was a young manâI was proud to plant Holy Cross in their midst. . . . Well, well! This is my altar, too; and if the stones are lesser and a little tumbled, priests and people sing and dance, when the time comes, as loudly, gaily as ever when I was young. Always those who can sing and dance! JOHANNES. Yoh! Sleepy! . . . Though I slept under the rocks to help you build the altar before dawn, I slept, indeed I did, good father! PRIEST. I saw you, Johannes; and when I passed you were asleep. Why, as soon as you waked, did you not come to me? JOHANNES. Yoh!âI saw you, father, but you were busy too soon. PRIEST. Oh, Johannes, when you have kept the Epiphany for many years to come, you will know one must be up long before others, even before the light, if one is old, and has work to do. Come, come, we waste our breath. . . . There are more stones than there used to be, you idle, little loon. . . Many more stones. How they grow and increase! JOHANNES. I wish I could see the stones grow. PRIEST. That, child, you will never see. The stones grow when the nights are very dark. Come, come, Johannes. . . . I will pile for a time, and youâlook you!âthere are seven or more loose stones down yonder by the stream-course. . . . Run and bring them as you can. [The Priest and Boy build and carry in silence.] JOHANNES. What are those men on the ridge? Are they travellers? PRIEST. Where, boy? No, they are not on the road; they are turned away from the road to Addis Ababa. JOHANNES. Are they coming to your altar? PRIEST. No, childâthe earliest worshipper will not come before the light. JOHANNES. They have spears. . . . PRIEST. Johannes, they are not the elephant-hunters. See, they have rifles. . . . They are the King's Guard. Why, do they come? I am trembling, Johannes, at the King's Guard. JOHANNES. There is a prisoner among them; he has no weapon. . . he must be a prisoner. They are coming close. PRIEST. Yesus! It is the Ras Byzance. They have brought him here before the dawn of the Feast Day, God forgive them, that the people might not suspect he should die thus early; and before the sun is up, and the people gather to the Feast, he will be dead and beyond rescue. It is the Ras Byzance brought here to die. [An armed escort sweeps down the slope with spears erect, Ras Byzance in their midst. The old Priest raises his hand.] In the name of God! Johannes, you must go on seeking stones, and I must build onâor the people will come and find no altar. I have committed the Ras Byzance to God. We of Ethiopia are the first among Christians and we must celebrate our blessing. THE CAPTAIN OF THE ESCORT. No-one upon the verge! We hoped to find the Ras Tasanna waiting. [Ras Walda Giorgis comes from behind the Guard and joins Ras Byzance.] Highnesses, Be seated! [He withdraws to a little distance and sits on a rock; his men lounge about and squat among the rocks, like great white birds in their shammas, their rifles over their knees, their spears bristling. From among them Barrambarras Maru, the King's dwarf, comes out. One of the soldiers, who is standing, hinders him, but he runs between the man's legs and topples him over, only to be caught up by another and held head downwards while he cries and screams till he is loosed. The Escort laugh uncontrollably.] RAS BYZANCE. [Leaning against a rock to Ras Walda Giorgis, seated on a lower rock.] Oh, a good laugh to hear! It rings of life. [He laughs, too.] The Midget! As a naughty, little child He promises he will be good. Poor Midget, Poor Barrambarras Maru, but he threw One man head over heels, though he is frightened At elephants and runs away. Poor Midget, Now caught heels over head . . . ha, ha!âand crying He will be good, if he may touch the earth, And feel his little feet flat under him . . . Why is he here? RAS WALDA GIORGIS. He tells all that he sees To Menelik at night. At nightâah, yes! Could I believe what he will tell at night! To die. . . . To feel so small a thingâ As in a storm of thunder when the storm Is flash and crash at one. . . . A brave, a ruler, A young man, and of no account! Confusion And smothering discord round meâI so small, A dwarf may well be witness of my end! Byzance . . . O loved! RAS BYZANCE. This purple flower, now shut, opening at daylight Will close and will be withered when they dance This afternoon about that altar pile; And on the blossom-shaft Another flower to-morrow, at daylight, Will open for that morning. . . . Why, the name Addis AbabaââThe New Flower!â . . . The King's New Flower! . . . It is one record. RAS WALDA GIORGIS. Menelik And Walda Giorgis never will forget. RAS BYZANCE. Oh, but life is so rampant, and so fresh, The new things are so fresh and brim it up With food that quivers! . . . I can never die As I am now, sound in my body's health, A new day in me and a stretching force Alert, couched as a hunter, in my blood. Oh, can I die? . . . Even Menelik himself Would not be crowned at Axum, being afraid Of the old prophecy he would be killed At Axum of the Sacred Grove, if ever He went within its precincts: Menelik Refused the crown where he must pay by death. Would I were there within the Sacred Grove, The Sanctuary Grove, where no King's Laws Can touch the fugitive for any deed! And mine!âWhat is my crime for which I die? One held as guiltless in our country; one That is accorded praise in other men; I killed my wedded wife, false to my love, False every hour in senses and in heart . . . Yet I am here, driven to extremity For lack of proof, when all was evidence. Once, Walda Giorgis,âonce We saw an antelope chased to a chasm, Its fore-feet and its hind-feet on one slab Touching each other, all its feet. . . . We laughed. I am that antelope. . . . Why does he stay, This Ras Tasanna? Why is he so long? RAS WALDA GIORGIS. Driven to the verge of earth, that antelopeâ Do you remember, Byzance?âit had sky, Blue sky alone behind it? I am nothing: But our great King has spoken and I speak What he would have me speak. He bade me say The Queen of Sheba blessed the Lord his God For Soloman, blessed God that He delighted To set the King over His chosen people Of Israel to 'stablish them for ever, And therefore made him King that he might do Judgment and justice: then she gave him gold, And spices, and a spice than which no other Was like to that she gave to Soloman. Byzance, he told me you could give that spiceâ It were your sacrifice, your willing death That he should rule, his justice unimpugned: And giving that, you would not die so hard. RAS BYZANCE. He pleaded for me, he was merciful. [Ras Byzance crosses over to where the Dwarf watches him from behind a rock.] Say, Barrambarras Maru, say to-night At dawn Ras Byzance died and blessed the King; For happy are his men, happy his servants Who stand before him, happy at his side. [The Dwarf nods. Ras Byzance returns and sits cross-legged on the ground by Ras Walda Giorgis.] I have given myself to death. . . . Do you remember Before Adowa, in the early morning, We said good-bye; we gave ourselves to death?â And would have so surrendered us with joy For any cause our King's command made ours. We said good-bye, we gave ourselves to death, And parted for the battle. . . . In our tent That morning, covered over by its folds, Were many spring-flowers, we had spread it over . . . By the beds, crocuses; and, by the pole, Bunches of lilies; and the day was such Our life was perfect pleasure. Walda Giorgis, Do you remember when we met at night Across that big Italian laid along, Who cried to see his mother, so they said; And some, he cried for Maryam, God's Mother; How the man quivered, as I once had seen A whirlpool in a lake, and then he fell Back to his earth, what he was fashioned of? [Ras Byzance springs to his feet.] Oh, I can never die! The dawn is coming out, forth to its life: It will have morning and the noon while young; And then fade, but according to its hours. And Iâ Oh, I am shown, brought out from my dark prison, Cast forth, as downpour of the rains will wash A gold coin from the soil, for Ras Tasanna To snatch and hide again in earth . . . Ha, Captain, I saw your sign . . . Sentinel-goats give the white herds such warning If a lion look down from the ridge's top . . . Oh! I have seen. [The Soldiers are drawn up in line, their rifles shouldered, their spears erect. Ras Byzance quickly kisses Ras Walda Giorgis, and stands grasping the cross at his throat, his left hand in his friend's.] RAS WALDA GIORGIS. [Whispers.] Your death must be as hers . . . her eyes were shut. Close yours at last of all. RAS BYZANCE. No, with wide sight. [Enter Ras Tasanna and a few followers.] RAS TASANNA. [To Ras Walda Giorgis.] Highness, we missed the ground, until we rose The spur of hill out yonder. Give me pardon. [Ras Byzance, throwing his black cloak from his shoulder, advances to Ras Tasanna, who at the same moment draws his sword. They look straight in each other's faces.] RAS BYZANCE. I bless the Kingâand I appeal to God. Kill me! [Ras Tasanna delivers one stroke. Ras Byzance leaps forward, then falls back.] Oh! Oh! [He dies.] [Ras Walda Giorgis kneels by him. Ras Tasanna, the cross-hilt Dervish sword still in his hand, bows over him.] RAS TASANNA. But is he surely dead? [He takes from Ras Byzance's head the lion auriole and holds the edge of hair to his lips.] Abenetah, Dead, as that morning you lay deadâ And in his blood as you, Abenetah! [He rises, inclines slightly towards Ras Walda Giorgis, and goes out, the sword still in his hand.] [Ras Walda Giorgis falls weeping over the body. The Priest, who stretched out his hand as the blow fell, now continues to build his altar. Two Soldiers bring a mat on which to lay the body. There is an approaching sound of drums tapped and the stems of gevara blown as trumpets. The first worshippers arrive, while the old Priest hurriedly sets up a Silver Greek Cross in the centre of his altar.] THE CAPTAIN OF THE ESCORT. [To Ras Walda Giorgis.] Highness, the people come. We must depart. RAS WALDA GIORGIS. [Without lifting his head.] I weep the King's grief. . . . Let his people's grief Mingle with mine. CAPTAIN. Highness, the King's command. [The people press forward.] VOICES. What is it? . . . Who has fallen? . . . We have been cheatedâsee! . . . Our Lord Ras Byzance! Unjustly killed! Oh, see! . . . The victim of a wantonâ . . . Of revenge! . . . Of Cruelty! We will revenge him! . . . Tear His body from these executioners . . . Who weeps him? . . . Rifles, men! We have our rifles . . . . . . That is Walda Giorgis, The Ras our King loves best. Listen! He speaks. RAS WALDA GIORGIS. [Rising and intervening between the Escort and the crowd.] King Menelik did justice on my friend, On his belovedâthe justice of your laws Of Ethiopia. We all . . . the dead, And Iâyea, and the King of Kings appeal To God . . . O people, hence and keep His Feast; And peaceably. It is the King's command. Let there be peace! The dead removes to judgment Where deeds are clear in their own evidence, As stars by shining faultless from themselves. Our justice is but blind and dark, at best, Beneath a firmament of heavy cloud, Where what seems may not be, what is lies covered, And nothing is as wisdom gives it forth. Captain, take up the body, let us bear it Back over the great Downs. No more must sorrow Dim this great Feast of the Epiphany. Sing round your altar. In the name of God! [The body of Ras Byzance, covered by his black cloak, is borne out. The people, gathering round the altar, wail their hymn, to drums and gevara-pipes and one-stringed lyres.] People, rejoice! Christ is beheld, Light of the East, Shown to the South; Brought by the Wise Down the old road Whereâon God's Ark Came from God's Hill, Came in the days Of Menelik, son Of Nikaula Wise!â Down the old road From Sheba made, On which the Queen Went forth with gifts, With spice and gold, With questions hardâ Down the old road Our Queen trod back With all she asked From Soloman.</field>
