Thomas Blount Mr. G. Vandenhoff. Robert Mr. W. Lacey. Bernard Mr. Ayliff. Harris Mr. Honner. Stephen Mr. W. Payne. Jacob Mr. Wigan. William Mr. Kerridge. Lady Blanche Madame Vestris.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âA Room in Sir Philip Brilliant's House. Enter Bernard and Harris. Har. What time to-morrow? Ber. At noon, I told thee, he sets off. Be thou forthcoming an hour before at the latest; and mind no item be wanting. We lack leisure for mistakes. Har. I shall be careful. How takes he this route to Ireland? Ber. As he takes everythingâwith an even temper. Har. He goes not there to sleep. Ber. No; when he ought to be awakeâbut he will lose no wink of rest that a proper man should profit by; no more than he will step aside to avoid watching, toil, or peril; which he will share with the meanest soldier in his regiment. Sir Philip Brilliant is a butterfly in the drawing-room, but a man in the field. His nature is of the true stuff! He is a blade of proof in a dainty scabbard; you may laugh at the scabbard, but you won't at the blade. Har. And takes he this expedition so coolly? Ber. Coolly?âJudge of the fever it throws him into, when I tell you he has been occupied this hour past in trying on a new suit, with which he means to affront all comparison to-day, for its fashion and splendour. Let us be gone. Here he comes. Har. And with him Master Robert, his valet. What a pleasant incontinent rogue that Master Robert is! Ber. Ay, but a frank one, and honest withalâa rogue for the humour only. Har. I will tell you a trick he played me. Ber. Nay; if you begin with his tricks, there will never be an end. Har. But I must tell thee. Ber. Well; be it as we pass to the door, then. Quick! They are here. [Bernard and Harris go out. Enter Sir Philip and Robert. Sir Phil. Now, Robertâfor I know you have an eyeâ Examine me. Scan me from head to foot And round about, and say how fits my dress, And as you love me, Robert, use your skill. Lie the seams fair? Sits any part awry? Observe the buttons their due distances? The slashes their proportions and their places? The skirts their lengths and uniformity? Lurks anywhere a wrinkle, or a crease? Find me a fault, dear Robert, if you can. Rob. The suit, methinks, is perfect. Sir Phil. Look again And jealously! Find me a fault, I'll find A crown for you. Rob. Sooner I'd miss the fault Than get the crown. Sir Phil. I know thy honesty. But find the fault, although thou gett'st the crown. Rob. What's that? Sir Phil. What, Robert? Rob. If I may believe My eyesâ Sir Phil. Be sure thou mayst, if 'tis a fault Thou think'st thou seest. Rob. 'Tis a fault I see! Sir Phil. What is it? Rob. Yet, perhaps, 'tis not a fault. Sir Phil. It must be one! Thou'rt not inclined to see it, And therefore doubt'st it! What is it? Rob. Alas! It is a fault. Sir Phil. A great or little one? Don't keep me in suspense; I'm on the rack! Well, Robert, well! Rob. It is a little fault! A very little faultâa wrinkle only About an inch, a quarter, and a tenth In length. Sir Phil. Were it the tenth without the rest, It spoils the suitâoff with't! It shall go back! Rob. It much becomes you! Well the colour sorts With your complexion!âand the pattern flogs All past achievements of the shaping art! And 'tis a dress of excellent proportions, Sets off your person to unmatch'd advantage. Look at the sleeve alone!âHow plain it shows The tailor tax'd his brains! Sir Phil. Where lies the wrinkle? Rob. Here, near the seam of the left shoulder. Sir Phil. That's A place a wrinkle may have leave to come! Canst help the wrinkle? There's the piece I promised For finding it. If thou canst help it, now, That piece will find a fellow. Rob. I shall try. I will not promise you I shall succeed. Stand straight and still. Now, please you, raise your arm; Now put it down againâUpon my life 'Tis growing less. Sir Phil. Well done, good Robert. Rob. 'Tis Almost away. Sir Phil. Say it is quite away, I'll give thee the third piece. Rob. I would I could; No hope of that, I fear! A wrinkle is A stubborn thing! Eh?âWhat?âI must be blind? Why, where is it? Sir Phil. Is't gone? Rob. I am bewitch'd! Is aught the matter, think you, with my sight? Or that is gone, or else the wrinkle 's gone; So gone I swear I cannot find the place! I can't believe there ever was a wrinkle! Sir Phil. Good Robert, there are the two crowns. Rob. Dear sir, I don't deserve them. Sir Phil. Nay!â Rob. Indeed I don't. Sir Phil. I'll not believe thee. Rob. Nay, I swear I don't. I must have fancied that there was a wrinkle. Sir Phil. Robert, a virtue may become a vice, Carried too far! Thou art too honest, Robert. Rob. Nay, hear me, sir! Sir Phil. I won't! There was a wrinkle! Did I not set me on my perfect poise? Stood I not motionless as block of stone? Then at thy bidding raised I not my arm, And lower'd it again, that thou mightst jerk My skirts to take the wrinkle out?âand now Persuade me there was none! There was a wrinkle! I will not hear thee!âPeace! So Lady Blanche And Lady Anne were in the Park to-day! How look'd fair Lady Blanche? Rob. Oh, charmingly! But her companion were the maid for me; I love her lip of scorn! It dares a man! Sir Phil. That's shrewdly felt! He were a man indeed That carried her! That man is yet to come! She glories in her single state; and, train'd To mastery in studies men affect, And seldom progress in, as well as she, Looks down on all our sex, o'erbearingly, And leaves the field to lovely Lady Blanche; Who, though she smiles on courtship, looks as cold On matrimony as her scornful friend; While troops besiege herâI among the rest. But now good-bye to Venus! Mars commands! Be ready, Robert, for the route to-morrow! We march at one: meanwhile to Ludgate Hill I go, that careless artisan to chide My beaver jewel who so slightly set, I lost it in the street. Men call me fop, And so I am, so will be, and why not? It is my humour! Better fop than fool; And he's a fool that does not please himself; And so the more they smile, the more they may; The more I'll give them cause, and smile myself, Sitting at ease in mine own snug content, Wearing a cheery, frank, and saucy cheek! Now tell me, Robert, what men say of me? What comeliness give they me credit for Besides my person, which I know will pass? Rob. They say, though rather vain, you are very brave. Sir Phil. What is it to be brave! I give Heaven thanks I was not born a spaniel!âWhat had I To do with that? Find something of mine own For which they praise me, I shall thank them then! What say they to my gait? I made my gait Myself! There's matter in men's gait, good Robert! Therein you have the impress of their callings: There is the clerk's gait, which implies obedience; The shopkeeper's, half service, half command; The merchant's, o'er-revolving speculations; The lawyer's, quick and keen at quirks and flaws; The student's, ponderous as piles of folios; The courtier's, supple, prompt for courtesies; The soldier's, keeping time with drums and trumpets; And twenty othersâall most common-place! But there's one gait that's paramount of allâ The gentleman's, that speaks not any calling; Shows him at liberty to please himself; And, while it meditates offence to none, Observes a proper negligence towards all, And imperturbable complacency! [They go out. SCENE II. âMaster Blount's House.âA Room contiguous to his Shop. Enter John Blount and Thomas Blount. Thomas. I will not bide the baiting of thy tongue!â I say, I will not!âLet my father rail, I'll hear him patiently. I owe not thee Observance!âWhat's the year or two thou hast The start of me? John. I speak but for thy good. Thomas. Nay, not for that! Thou wouldst speak kindly else! The fault thou find'st would reach no ear but mine; I know thee, brother; my defect thou makest A finger-post to show thine own deserts, To win me anger, while thyself winn'st praise! I know thee, John!âI say, no more of this; I will not bear it!âshould not!âI'm a man! John. Wilt strike me? Thomas. Heaven forbid my mother's son Should e'er get blow from me. I tell thee what, Thou aim'st at empire of my father's heart! Thou to my father's business wouldst be heir! Be so!âThou ne'er shalt find, in me, a let. His stock-in-trade, good-will, whate'er he hath Pertaining to his craft, or grown from it, I freely from this hour renounce all share in! I'll seek my fortune!âHere I will not stay To play the money-grubâwhile men not made Of better metal, find themselves a name That lifts them 'bove their birth! Enter Master Blount. Mas. Blount. How's this?âat words? Thy brother John has been reproving thee. And thou resistest himâand wherefore, son? Because he's right, and thou art in the wrong! The counter, boy!âgo practice patience, there! 'Twas that which made thy father, with the help Of industry. 'Tis roof, son; bed and board, With which 'tis well thou art provided, else Thou ne'er hadst earn'd them, Thomas, for thyself! Thomas. I might have earn'd them, had I been allow'd! Mas. Blount. Allowed?â Thomas. To earn them in the way I could! Mas. Blount. Thou'dst be a soldier, or wouldst go to seaâ Chimeras evermore of boyhood's brain! John. I never knew them, father. Mas. Blount. Never, John! Thou ever didst my wish, and didst it well. John. And found my own in it. Except for sleep And meals, I never took an hour from work, Nor would, suppose I mightânor cared I what You set me toâthe crucible, the vice, The desk or counterâ'twas your will, and done. Mas. Blount. Ay, John, you are a pattern of a boy! Go, Thomas! copy by your elder brother! Demean yourself submissively to him; Rememb'ring thou dost thy father's will! Thomas. I love my father! Would that I could love My father's craftâbut that I cannot love! [Goes out, following John. Enter Mistress Blount. Mis. Blount. Heard I not words? I did!âwhat's wrong with Thomas? John has been chafing him again! He's not The boy to bear it, nor is't right he should. The shop don't fit him, husband! Thou wouldst put Thy turnspit to his use, thy hound to his; Did any urge thee to exchange their work, Thou'dst think him fool, didst thou not call him one! Thy cart-horse foal, when thou didst set to cart, Thou didst the thing was wise!âas wisely didst To break thy jennet's filly for the saddle; As beast of draught she were not worth her meat! Givest ear to me? Dost weigh my words? Mas. Blount. I do. Mis. Blount. And if thou dost, thou wilt not find them light. And dost perceive the sequel? Mas. Blount. No. Mis. Blount. I am sure Thou dost not! Never canst thou see the thing That lies not straight before thee. Ope thine eyes, And I will put the sequel in their range, Point blank! Men vary more than horse or dog. Not as the parentage the progeny! The noble's cradle rocks a churlâthe churl's A nobleman! A simple craftsman thou, Hast son, the craft was never made would fit;â And he must drudge because his father did! Mas. Blount. Drudge dost thou say? Mis. Blount. Ay, drudge! and say't again. Mas. Blount. His brother drudges. Mis. Blount. So his brother may! It is his humour; he's his father's son. Mas. Blount. Whom takes the other after? Mis. Blount. Whom?âwhy me! I tell thee, Thomas is his mother's son. No handicraft will he make progress in! Money he values for the using on'tâ Would buy a coach and horses in the time Thou balancest the outlay of a truck! Mas. Blount. A hopeful son, methinks, has Master Blount, The Ludgate jeweller. Mis. Blount. Most hopeful, John; But not in the shape thou wishest hope to come in, With sleek comb'd hair and ponderous busy brow, Scanning a bodkin to resolve him whether 'Tis gold or pinchbeck!âI forgot!âthy hope Hath comely apron on!âNow look at mine! A youth of standard height!âproportion'd, well, In trunk and limb!âof handsome face and bold! Very!âA cap and plume upon his head!â Across his field of breast a scarf and belt! And, in the belt, a sword, as fits a man! Mas. Blount. What cavalier is this? Mis. Blount. What cavalier? Thou knowest not thine own son, husband John! I lose all patience with thee! Listen now! Thou hast a son whom fortune meant to climb, And thou wouldst have to creep!âWhat use is he In thy shop or workshop, where thou cast'dst him when He came from school, as metal that is fused Into the mould, thinking he'd take what shape It pleased thee give him?âFlesh and blood are not So passive, John!âHow little knowest thou, Dear John, beyond thy trade! Nine months ago Lapsed his apprenticeship of seven long years, And earns he now the keep of journeyman? No!âDo I blame him?âNo!âWhen thou gett'st gold To do the work of lead, I'll blame him, John, But not till then. Mas. Blount. The fault is thine. Mis. Blount. Is mine! Am I in fault? Mas. Blount. I sayâ Mis. Blount. Am I in fault? Mas. Blount. I won't say fault. Mis. Blount. Go on. Mas. Blount. Thou hast him taught The ways of gentleman. Contents thee not He learns our homely measures, he must skip As courtiers do, so thou provid'st him with A foreign dancing-master! Not enough The jockey, taught his brother, should teach him, Behoves him have a soldier's seat, and so Thou gett'st a regimental riding-master! Mis. Blount. Proceed, good husband John. Mas. Blount. It pleased thee not Dick Cottingham should teach him quarter-staffâ Mis. Blount. Dick Cottingham!âI'd beat Dick Cottingham At quarter-staff myself! Mas. Blount. Thou must employ Professionals in that. Mis. Blount. Teach a boy right, Or not at all! Go on! Mas. Blount. From quarter-staff He needs must to the rapier go. Mis. Blount. No doubt! Mas. Blount. The whichânot satisfied the boy should get A simple notion on'tâhe practises Till he can beat his master! Mis. Blount. Art not glad Of that?âArt thou not glad on't, husband John? The day will come, and, mind my words, it will, When thou wilt chuckle at it!âchuckle, husband! Thy boy can beat his master!âwho'll beat him? Mas. Blount. John is as good a boy! Mis. Blount. Who cheapens John? What loss to him his brother gets his due? He likes the inside of the counter!âWell, He has it!âThomas likes the other side! And yet thou know'st not John!âThough he's my son, He's cunning. 'Tis not natural in one, So young in years, to be, in acts, so old. The husbandman prefers a backward spring! The fruit is fear'd that comes before its time! Did John observe thee less, 'twould please me more! What wouldst thou say now, should I tell thee plain His fancies look a mile beyond the shop, In which thou think'st his heart wrapp'd wholly up? 'Tis so; he'd laugh to throw the apron off He smiles at putting on! Mas. Blount. Thou wrong'st him, wife. Mis. Blount. Believe so, since thou wiltâlet me know Thomas. He'll ne'er ply craft, but be a gentleman. That time is come with you, and still you toil. Mas. Blount. I'll think on what thou say'st. Mis. Blount. So, husband, do. The man who has a wife hath counsel, John, At hand, that's ever better than his own! Goes out. Sir P. Bril. [without]. Within is he? Then I'll step in to him. Mas. Blount. Sir Philip Brilliant!âHe speaks angrily. Sir Phil. [Entering.] How comes it, Master Blount, you treat me thus? Why callest thou thyself a jeweller, And sett'st a gem so carelessly, as soon As worn, 'tis lost? Where is the brilliant, sir, I paid thee down a hundred crowns for? Look! 'Tis gone. [Showing his hat. Mas. Blount. I see it is, and grieve for it. Sir Phil. Wilt thou replace it? Mas. Blount. Is it fit I should? Sir Phil. Yes; for you set it. Mas. Blount. Yes; and set it well! Sir Phil. Well, Master Blount! Sett'st thou a jewel well, And falls it out as soon as set? Mas. Blount. The loop You must have strain'd!âYou flung your beaver down, And gave it blow, perhaps; or doffing it Too freely, swung'st against a wall or rail, And shook'st, thyself, the jewel from its seat. Sir Phil. Not so I doff my beaver!âThrow it down! 'Sdeath, Master Blount, thou think'st it not enough, Through fault of thee I lose a peerless gemâ Thou must disparage, too, my bearing, sir! My carriage, sir, wherein I stand alone, Which prize beyond a mineâay, mines of gems! I fling my beaver down?âI strike a wall Or rail, in doffing it? I?âI?âThe gem I might forgive, but can't pass over that! Down, sir, and beg my pardon! Thom. [Coming forward.] He shall not! The gem was fitly set. Sir Phil. How knowest thou? Thom. My father says it!âThat the gem was lost, Was fault of thine alone. Sir Phil. Do you know me? Thom. Yes. Sir Phil. I know thou dost; yet knowing it, I doubt, Through wonder at thy boldness, sirrah! Thom. What! Sir Phil. Know'st thou what cuffs are? Thom. Yes; I have given them! Sir Phil. Ay? 'Tis time thou learn to take them. Thom. Thou'rt not he Can teach me that. Sir Phil. [Aside to him.] Ay? thou preferr'st perhaps A higher lesson. Canst thou use a sword? Thom. [Aside to Sir Philip.] By trying thou canst judge. Sir Phil. [Aside to Thomas.] If worthy one, Thou'lt steal a rapier out and follow me A pace beyond the wallâI'll wait thee there. [Goes out. Mas. Blount. What said he, Thomas? Thom. Somethingânothing, sir. His fault, methinks, he half begins to see. That errand, brother, you would send me on, I hasten now to do. Mas. Blount. What errand, Thomas? Thom. John will inform you, sir. [Goes out. Mas. Blount. What is it, John? John. I vow he has scared my memory out of me. Mas. Blount. What errand has thy brother gone upon? John. I vow I have forgot. Mas. Blount. There's something more Than he would let me see.âThy cap, boy, haste, While I get mine, for we must after him! [They go out. SCENE III. âThe outside of London Wall. Enter Sir Philip Brilliant. Sir Phil. The goldsmith's son has won me! There are men, I have heard warriors say, look beautiful In action. So would he! How radiantly The man shone out! We'll change a pass or two, I'll touch him, that I prove him! 'Tis one thing To talk about the rapier's point, another To look upon it, and another yet To feel it. He shall feel itânot to rue it! He comes! There is purpose in his looks! His heart And feet are going the same way! The man I take him for!âworth winning for a friend! You have made haste. Enter Thomas. Thom. What haste I could. Sir Phil. I know it, And I expected it, and like you for it! I love an enemy to be in earnest! You are sure you use the rapier? Thom. Judge yourselfâ I am ready for you!âCome! [They fight. Sir Phil. You are too hot, And lay yourself too open. Twice just now I could have run you through! Thom. Why did not you? Sir Phil. Aha! Beware, or you will make me hug you! Thom. Come on. Sir Phil. Be cooler, then. Thom. I will. Sir Phil. That's right! Most sweetly parried!âBetter yet return'd! That feint was masterly; I balk'd it thoughâ I have hit you! Thom. No! Come on! Sir Phil. I am sure I have! Thom. Come on! Sir Phil. You felt me, for I felt my point! Thom. Come on, I say! Sir Phil. Since you will have it so! That longe meant something, but it would not do. Prepare!âI'll hit you now again! 'Tis done! Thom. I fight, not talk! Sir Phil. I talk whene'er I fight, As when I eat or drink. Thom. Come on! Sir Phil. Again! I have hit you thrice. Thom. I feel no wound! Sir Phil. There's blood! Thom. A scratch brings blood! Sir Phil. A deep one, though, it takes To drain the cheek; and thine is growing paleâ Not, I'll be sworn, with fear! I touch'd you, only, Because I meant to sting you, not to kill, Before I knew you, as I know you now. But knowing you as now I do, I swear I would not kill you for mine own life's sake, Which at your will I place! [Throws down his sword; Thomas drops his, and tottering towards Sir Philip, faints in his arms. I fear'd 'twas so, But fear no worse.âHe faints, from loss of blood; A flesh-wound, nothing graverâStanch'd, 'tis heal'd! Enter Master Blount and John. Mas. Blount. Sir Philip, what's amiss? Sir Phil. Your son revives; A passing sickness only, Master Blount; Stanching removes it quite. Your handkerchief To keep the compress on I make of mine. His colour comes again, and all is right! Now hear you, Master Blount. Ne'er left your shop A jewel rich as is this son of yours. Commit his fortunes to my hands!âYou shall! I have proved his metalâIt has won my heart, And turn'd me from a foe into a friend; Yea more, a brother, bound to him as fast As he partition'd with me the same blood. Refuse me not!âI will not be gainsaid! My footman comesâmy carriage is at hand. Enter Footman. The gem I lost I will forgive thee for, And fifty to its back, so grant me this. Although not born a gentleman, thy son Was form'd to be one; such I'll make of him! So farewell desk and counter, Master Blount! There!âGentlyâcome along with us!âTake care! [Sir Philip and his footman supporting Thomas, go out, followed by Master Blount. John. The shop is now my own! As we came hither, My father said he would retire from it, And leave his trade to me!âand if he does, Not long his trade and I keep company. We have been intimates too closeâtoo longâ Familiarity begets contempt! I hate and scorn my trade. He little knows What riches burrow in his drawers and chests; The keys of which I keep, and he forgets! My plans are laid!âSoon as he quits the town, I sell off stock and trade, and quit the shop! Talk of our Thomas!âHe a gentleman! Where is the money? I have taken care Of that! From interest on his bonds alone My father will retire in affluence; The rest is mine, and I'll make use of it To lay myself out for a high alliance By marriage!âTrust to me for policy. If there is one thing I am better in Than any other thingâ'tis policy. [Goes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âThe Park. Enter Robert, Stephen, and Jacob. Rob. He is as rich as CrÅsus, sirs, with wit Enough to keep his purse-strings tight, unless His own particular occasion prompts The wish to loosen them! He is at once Luxurious and a miser.âSome good nature, More cunning, less discretion. You see through him; He has a vanity which lays him open To commonest observers: for example,â Know him an hour, and he spreads out for you A banquet of his tastes, his faculties, His qualities; wherein he most succeedsâ Which is by turns, indeed, in everythingâ Not that he would appear to slight his neighbours, Or wish to pass for anything, beyond A common, simple, ordinary man! Steph. Where made you this redoubtable acquaintance? Rob. Why, at a race-course, on a holiday, When fortune made us neighbours. One who knew me At distance, give me salutation by The title which I hold in virtue of My place near fair Sir Philip! In a moment I was a friend the richer! Straight he grappled me! His name, his station, income, residence, All in a twink were mineâhis sole omission The stock he sprung from, which he would root upâ Yea, sirs, the very father that begot him, And gave up stock and trade to himâand affluence Beyond his calculation; the slow piling Of fifty years and upwards, to himself Grown out of mind, but not to his successor; Who, having long imprison'd upstart wishes Beneath the homely apron of his craft, Now throws this off, no more of use to him, And shows the others that now need no concealment! Converts his drawers and shelves to currency, His currency to lands and messuages, And o'er the tradesman's counter featly vaulting, Springs into the saddle of the gentleman! By strangest chance I learnt his history. Jacob. Hopeful acquaintance. Rob. Say fruition-full! Well, sir, âI must go home with him; partake âWhat a plain dresser sends.â Ere dinner 's done, I am in his bosom! Now beseeches he My list of lady spinsters, which I give him, The features, stature, carriage, and complexion, Wit, temper, parentage, and education; When, of my goodness, prays he introduction To one I think would suit him! Steph. Which, of course, You grant him. Rob. Readily! Steph. My life upon it, The countess! Jacob. Charlotte!âMaid to Lady Jane? Rob. No less. Jacob. Had he but known the rogue he dealt with! A simpleton as safe beside a sharper! Rob. Yet knowing, modestly, I had my masters Compared to whom I am a journeyman, I promised presentation to your lordshipsâ For you are lords in virtue of your places, As I, in right of mine, a baronetâ And here appointed him this afternoon His walk to that intent! Ah, here he is! I pray you keep your rank before your eyes In all you say and do. They only may Forget their rank who have good title to it, And by the lapse prove gainers. Mind, you are lords. John. [Entering.] Good morning to you, fair Sir Philip. Fair Is fairest worth.âSo, sir, I bow to you. Rob. The noble friends I had the honour, sir, Of naming to youâthis Lord Stephen Hyde, And this Lord John Fitzwalter. John. Dear me, sir, You overpower me!âMay I use the freedom To shake hands with your lordships? Steph. 'Tis a boon, sir, We would entreat of you! John. [To Robert.] There's noble breeding! Rob. Whence come you? John. From my after-dinner airing, In my own phaeton, built to my own order, After a pattern of my own designing; The springs my own, the perch, the pole, the colour, Harness and everything! So please your lordships, I have a taste, and it shall have its way While I can pay for it. Steph. As right it should, sir. John. Then am I fond of driving. Jacob. Most men like The thing that they excel in. John. Oh, my lord!â Your lordship may have seen me hold the reinsâ I flatter myself you have! Jacob. You may so, safely. John. I could have sworn you had! If there is one thing I master 'fore another, it is holding The reins. Rob. What did you before breakfast? John. Rideâ Your lordships fancy horses?âAll men do Who have good judgment, and can back them well. Mine are all thorough-bred!âmy hackney even!â And broke in for myself.âA horse, my lords, Should know his master, and him only!âNo Believing what a universe of mischief Is done by a strange hand! The mouth is spoil'd!â If not the mouth, the pace; if not the pace, The temper!âmaybe, temper, pace, and mouth Together!âWhat's the value of the horse! And then the seatâNo easy thing, my lords! Of fifty men who vault into the saddle, Not one may have a seat there! In the manage Be there one thing wherein I beat another, 'Tis in my seat! Steph. Most safely may you say it. John. Your lordship, I presume, has seen me ride. Sir Philip, 'hope you have not got a headache? Rob. Not I!âhave you? John. Why something rather like one, For which I blame the wine of yesterday. Rob. Nay, sir, the wine was good. John. Oh, excellent; A most sound wine, and of the proper age; Three years in wood, in bottle thrice that time; The merchant durst not cheat me, for he knows me. I ne'er keep wine but of prime quality! I have a cellarâNo one less occasion To find fault with his wine!âWere mine not good, The money was that bought it!âbut no foresight Is match against mishap!âA bottle may Be cork'd. 'Twas so with the last bottle! At The time I had a slight suspicion only, But now I am positive! Rob. You are deceived. John. Impossible, my dear Sir Philip. If I am superlative in anything, Beyond all other things that I excel in, 'Tis in my taste for wine! Rob. But now to business! My noble friends approve the match we spoke of, And promise you their interest, to help Your wish to its fulfilment! John. They o'erpower me! My lords, I am beholden to you more Than did I ransack the whole dictionary, I could find words of value to describe! Befits it, though, a private gentleman, Of modest fortune, only, at the best, Should offer hand to dame of quality? Talk'd you not, dear Sir Philip, of promotion? Rob. Oh, yes!âpromotion certainlyâLord John, Where have you the most interest? in church Or state? Steph. 'Tis difficult to sayâlet's see! Upon my word, I think it is a balance! Rob. And how say you, Lord Stephen? Jacob. Like Lord John, In church and state, my interest is equal. Rob. [To John.] How leans your predilection?âto the church? John. Why, hang it, no! the surplice spoils the figure, A man and gown sort strangely!âfancy me In a gown! I might endure it on the Sunday, But for the week-day gear that's tack'd to it! Of formal mode and sombre colour! Dress All the year round most like an undertaker In waiting upon funerals!âcould I wear This cap and plume were I a clergyman? Rob. [and the rest]. No, certainly! John. The church won't do for me. Rob. It must be in the state, then! For what office Would you be ready, on emergency, Say one fell sudden vacant? John. Will you believe me, I cannot tell! Rob. There is the Home department, And there's the Foreign! There's the minister Of War and of Finance!âDiplomacy Perhaps might suit your genius! Which of these Would find you most at home, sir? John. Do you know, I'm at a loss to tell!âIndeed I am! Upon my life I am!âTo answer you, Safely, for both your credit and my own, I think 'twere best I say, as likely one As another. Rob. Doubtless there is none you fear To undertake? John. None!âFear? No fear, Sir Philip! Find me the office, I am sure to find Abilities to fill it! Rob. Yet perhaps There's something you prefer to church or state; What think you of the army? John. Of the army? It is my taste, my bent, my very instinct! It must be!âwhy should else a fife and drum Raise in me such commotion? When I hear them, The war is all before me!âInfantry, Cavalry, and artillery, and baggage! Marchings, encampings, battles, sieges!âfeats In the field and breach of superhuman daring, Such perils breasted and o'ercome, as man Durst never cope before withâlook atâthink ofâ All of my own conceiving Rob. Dream you never Of dying in such straits? John. No!âNever! Rob. Strange!â I may say, wonderful! John. You may!âThrough bayonets And swords I rush, as they were stubbleâhail Of cannon-balls, shells, musketry, no more Than wither'd leaves blown round by winds in autumn! Rob. And are you never wounded? John. Wounded?âYes! Struck down, but up and on my feet again Almost in the self-same moment! Rob. Pain and all Forgotten? John. As a pin had scratch'd me. Rob. And Enacting more than ever! John. Miracles! Steph. He certainly was born to be a soldier. John. And such I will be with your leaves, my lords. What rank? Rob. Behoves you be an ensign first, From ensign to lieutenant, thence to captain, On captain mounts the major, on the major The colonel. John. Takes it long to be the colonel? Rob. By service long, by interest not at all! John. I'll choose the army. Rob. Yet, my lords, a word! 'Twill never do to court proud Lady Blanche As ensign or lieutenant; nay, as even Captain or major!âNothing less, my lord, Than colonel! Here is a dilemma! Steph. A Dilemma, certainly. Jacob. A sad dilemma. John. My lords!âSir Philipâwhat is to be done? Rob. Stop!âHold!âI have it!âWhat is sure to come, One surely may regard as come, already! Steph. Ay, come as certain, as about to come. Rob. And why not call him colonel then at once? Your lordship will have no objection? Steph. None. John. My dear good lord. Rob. Nor you, my lord? Jacob. No more Than his lordship. John. My most excellent good lord! Rob. Then, Colonel Blount, I give you joy! John. My dear Sir Philip! Steph. and Jacob. Give you joy, fair Colonel Blount. John. Dear lordsâDear friendâI choke with gratitude. Rob. There only wants the introduction now, Which I'll accomplish with your lordship's help. I know you'll patronize my friend, whilst I Take charge of Lady Blanche; and as we go, We'll settle time and place! Come, colonel; show us How you can court! John. Court, sir?âDid you say, court? Therein am I especially at home! May I presume on any excellence I have, it is on knowing how to court! [They go out. SCENE II. âA Room in the House of Lady Anne. Enter Charlotte and Jane. Char. A fine plot, is it not? Jane. But where the profit, Besides the mirth 'twill bring you? Char. Quite enough! Jane. You have not seen him yet? Char. That happiness Lies in perspective. They appoint to-day The time and place of meeting. If, by chance, You note me in the street with a strange friend, Remember I'm the countessâpass me by, Unless I give you sign I am myself. Jane. And Robert plann'd it all? Char. Robert?âFor shame! Sir Philip, if you please! If, when together, We talk of one another, keep in mind We are our noble selves! You Lady Anne! I, Lady Blanche!âRobert, Sir Philip Brilliant; Jacob and Stephen, of their masters' styles; Lord John Fitzwalter and Lord Stephen Hyde! And, so, through all our circle of familiars! 'Tis but with such, as do not understand us, Who know us less, than we do one another, We pass for commoners! You are new to us! Sir Philip is the author of the plot. 'Twas not to lose his time he went to collegeâ No more than others born and bred above himâ And spent three years there! You will travel ere You find his match in mischief. Jane. [Listening.] Did you hear My lady's voice? Char. I heard that person speak. Jane. That person? Char. Lady Anne, 'long as you live, Never let down yourself!âYou'll find too many Ready to do that kindness for you. Jane. [Listening.] There Is Lady Blanche. Char. I think it is that person. Don't look surprisedâalthough we owe her some Consideration, as our foster sister, Who shared with us our mother's nurtureânay, Participates with us almost one nature, Making a jest of love, and sport of lovers; While, she you deign to serve, escheweth both! We trust your ladyship will be at home To-morrow when we call. Jane. Yes, Charlotte. Char. Charlotte! Forgive me, Lady Anneâyour ladyship Forgets yourself! 'Tis Lady Blanche departs And bids good morning to you, lady! [They go out severally. SCENE III. âAnother Room. Enter Lady Blanche and Lady Anne. Lady Bl. Man!âman!âthe paragon!âThe fool, he is, When women know themselves and how to treat him; The knave, when left to his own practices! Is there a husband you can name, who bears His course of wooing out?âwho does not prove it A trade of common snaring?âwho resembles The man he was before the honey-moon? A woman's life, my friend, from girlhood onwards, Has melancholy progress! She begins A goddess; then declines into a brideâ Which means a young wife keeping holiday, As children, sent to school, go not at once To tasksânext sinks into a housekeeperâ Her wedding-ring her badge of office!âthence Haply into a nurse!âWhen, matters not How soon she settles into grandmama, To tell her offspring, of her second stock, The story of her cozening! Lady A. How I love you When thus you talk! Would all our sex were like you! And, yet, you suffer men, while I repel them! Lady Bl. I suffer them, to plague them, and I do so. You are an old maid by anticipation, And make the arch dissemblers stand aloof. Oh, how I dote upon a stanch old maid!â I'll die one!âShe stands up for liberty! Talk of the rights of men! The rights that want Upholding are the rights of women!âMen Are tyrants!âhave too many rights! We know it! Ours are the rights want champions! We should be lost Without old maidsâOh, the delicious crabs! The faces men make at them, when they find them Their masters! Lady A. Women have more soul than men. Lady Bl. Men have no soul at all compared to women! Look at Queen Bess! The man she made of Englandâ A man to cuff all comers! She was in fault In one thing, though. Lady A. And prithee what was that? Lady Bl. She did not call her own sex to her councils! Which had she done, women had proved themselves The things they could be, would men give them leave! Cecil and Burleigh!âBacon!âWhat were they But what a woman made them? Men, indeed! There was a sample of man's proper place, When Essex got his ears box'd!âDo you feel Your fingers tingle? Mine do!âYet was she In love with Essex! Lady A. Were you ne'er in love? Lady Bl. Are you in madness! Wherefore do you ask? Lady A. Because of late, whene'er you talk of love You sigh! I have had strange thoughts about you, Blanche. They call you a coquette, and so you are; Yet something tells me, once upon a time, You felt a touch of love. Do you remember A certain fair Whit-Monday? Ah, you blush! Lady Bl. Because you tax me!âBlush!âThat fair Whit-Monday We went a-shopping; and, for an adventure, Disguised ourselves as simple yeoman's daughters. What's there to blush at? Lady A. Nothing, if no moreâ If nothing follow'dâif that fair Whit-Monday You did not make a conquest of a youth Who waited on us. Lady Bl. Was it at the draper's? Lady A. No, Blanche. No youth was in the draper's shop! Lady Bl. The mercer's, then? Lady A. Nor was it at the mercer's, Nor yet the cordwainer'sâwhere had it been, How had the blushing youth contrived to take The span of your maidship's instep, all the while His eyes upon your faceâwhence, as I live, He never moved them, till we left the shop,â Except to find the articles we ask'd for!â A youth misused of fate to set him, where Behoved his betters rather wait than he! A lofty forehead, like a marble dome For princely thoughts to dwell in!âeyes to court Challenge of war or love, showing themselves Frankly and boldly at their postsâa nose Of the fine Grecian, with a touch of Rome; Elegance crown'd with strength; a mouth composed Of lips were fashion'd after Cupid's bow, And, like it, made to send his arrow home, Wing'd with their dulcet twang! ambitious chin, Dimpled and knobb'd like pattern AntinÃ¶us'! There is his face, which well his neck and bust Deserved; as for the rest of him, you know The counter hid him from us. Lady Bl. Counter-like! In calculation of the drawback, doubtless, His head and bust had suffer'd, through the fault Of his mis-shapen legs. I should not wonder Had he clubb'd feet. Lady A. Have you not seen his feet? Come! Did you never on adventure go A-shopping there again? Lady Bl. Well, Anne, I did! Again, and yet again.âNay, do not laugh, 'Twas only to enjoy the goldsmith's blush! Lady A. There, Blanche! Just now you could not find the shop! Lady Bl. Well! things will jump into one's memory When least we look for them. Why do you laugh? Don't laugh, dear Anne, and I shall tell you more! I took the goldsmith to my milliner's One day when he perforce would see me homeâ A yeoman's daughter could not well, you know, O'errule a goldsmith's son. Well, at the door In vain I dropp'd him curtsey after curtsey, In linsey-woolsey mode! He would not go. âHe must have speech with me a minute!âââNay!â âIndeed he must,ââthen said I, âNay,â again. âHe must in pity,ââstill did I say, âNay.â But what's the use of ânay,â said fifty times, If âyesâ at last will come?âand come it did: âHe might have speech a minute!â What's a minute? A portion of an hour! A portion gone, The hour is broken!âWhat's the value of A broken thing?âAs well he have the hour! The hour he had! The goldsmith's son was smitten; Love at first sight!âthe arrow in the core! Whereat the maid amusedâit may be pleased; Touch'd, will you have it so.âWell, she was touch'd!â Did after grant the goldsmith divers meetings, Listening in silence to his rhapsodies In rustic cloak, with hood drawn o'er her head, Her face but half-revealing! Till, at length, Feeling a somethingânothing like a passion!â Perhaps an interestâyes; like that one watches The progress of a pleasant story with, But which indulging, is but waste of time; Having a horror, too, of slaveryâ No matter how far out of reach of itâ And then, besides, admonish'd by my rank; At last I took the resolution To drop the masqueradeâalthough, I own, With some compunction. Lady A. He deserved some. Lady Bl. He! Why, was he not a man!âHe proved he was! Made out his right and title.âTook his leave Without good-bye, by word or yet by missive; Since when I ne'er have met him. 'Twas as well, Although it mortified me!âNothing more. Lady A. Who, think you, is come home? Sir Philip Brilliant. When we have time, I'll let you hear a tale Of him, that does him honour. His adventure Was likewise with a goldsmith's son. Lady Bl. Perhaps The same.âWhat was it?âCome, the heads of it? Lady A. They chanced to quarrel; fought. His adversary, Though wounded, would not own it, till almost He dropp'd with loss of bloodâwhereat Sir Philip, Amazed and captivated, grew his friend; Took him abroad with him, and step by step Has raised to his own rank. He comes with him, This very evening, to pay visit to me, And introduce the gentleman. Lady Bl. His name? Lady A. I never thought to ask it! Lady Bl. Should it be! You and Sir Philip are good friends, it seems. On me he has not call'd! Lady A. He is your slave. You have him at your foot whene'er you please; I own it has amazed me, that a man, So slight to contemplate, should have achieved An act of generous manhood so robust In healthy comeliness. Jane. [Entering.] Sir Philip Brilliant. Enter Sir Philip Brilliant and Thomas as Colonel Blount. Lady A. Welcome, Sir Philip. Sir Phil. Colonel Blount, my friend. Lady Bl. [Aside.] The goldsmith's son! Sir Phil. Fair Lady Anne, I kiss Your hand, and for my friend here, Colonel Blount, Claim your acquaintance. Lady A. [To Lady Blanche.] 'Tis the goldsmith's son! He does not know you! Lady Bl. [Aside.] How should he?âHe never Beheld my face except beneath my hood. How can he, in the countess, find a trace O' the simple yeoman's maid? You'll pardon me, I must go home! Good evening!âGo you to The rout to-night, Sir Philip? Sir Phil. Yes. Lady Bl. We'll meet; And I can answer for our host, he'll thank you To bring your friend.âFarewell.âGood morning, sir. [Goes out. Lady A. [Aside.] She seems disturb'd. Sir Phil. Fair Lady Anne, permit My friend to write a line that asks despatch,â Forgot on leaving home! Lady A. The library! Pray you step in and freely help yourself. Col. Blount. I thank you, lady!âHow resemblances, The most remote, recall familiar things, As in a ray of light one sees the sun! Less than the ray unto the sun is she That's gone, to her whose image she recall'd; And set before my mind, as palpably, As though the paragon stood, there, before me! [Goes out. Sir Phil. Dear Lady Anne, in your kind welcome back I gladly miss'd your wonted scorn of me. Lady A. Gladly!âwhy name it then to bring it back? See what you've done! What shall I call thee now? Ware from the milliner's, the tailor's, or The cordwainer's, or jeweller's, or what? Thyself is the least part of thee! The man Is trimmings to the dress.âThou art a ruff Of plaits elaborate and infinite; Thy vest, for curiosity of style, Armour of diamonds upon velvet plaited, Were better given a cabinet to keep, As theme for wonderment to after-time, Than left provision for the hungry air, That's sure to eat it up! Thy jerkin runs Enormous risk from thy ambition! trying With satin slashes, ribbon-knots, and lace, How close to woman's gear a man's may come, And still appear a man'sâthy trunks partake Its divers sins; and for thy hose, who says, In town or out of town, thou walk'st not in A shrubbery, why let him own he is blind, To save his credit for veracity! Thy very rapier would abjure the man! Its handle vouches for the laceman more Than the cutlerânay, nor him beside, alone; 'Twas plann'd in concert with a milliner! Which of the precious metals has the honour To help it to a blade! It cannot be A thing so exquisitely delicate Could pair with homely steel? Sir Phil. Give over! Lady A. I will. Sir Phil. I want a friend, dear Lady Anne. Lady A. A friend? And come you to a woman for a friend? Better you seek a man! Sir Phil. He cannot help me,â A woman can; she knows a woman's mind, And how 'tis hit; which, being done, they say, Her heart 's in jeopardy! Lady A. Who say so? They Who do not know her? Hit her heart, you are sure Of her mind. Sir Phil. No easy thing to do! For, now, Three years and upwards have I tried to hit The heart of Lady Blanche! Lady A. I know you have. Sir Phil. Three years are past, yet am I now as wide As ever of the mark. Lady A. Had you guess'd that At setting out, what labour had you spared, Or spent, perhaps, to more account, employ'd On some one else! Sir Philip! Sir Phil. Lady Anne? Lady A. For three years have you been my fair acquaintance; And, if I err not, all that lapse of time, You have enjoy'd good health! Sir Phil. Nay; no man better! Lady A. Your appetite has never fail'd you? Sir Phil. Never! Lady A. So I should think!âYou have always slept o' nights? Sir Phil. From laying down my head to lifting it! Lady A. Sound sleep?âNo trouble in the shape of dreams? Sir Phil. None that I recollect. Lady A. And yet in love! And not successfully!â'Tis very strange! Sir Phil. 'Tis very strange! Lady A. Come, tell me how you feel Towards Lady Blanche? What are the signs, whereby You know you love her, when you think of her? Do you sigh very deeply? Sir Phil. I'm not sure That e'er I sigh, at allâbut I'm in love. Lady A. You cannot be in love, unless you sigh. Sir Phil. A man may sigh, without his knowing it. Lady A. That's true. How feel you when another man Detains her ear aloof? Sir Phil. How feel I then? How should I feel? Lady A. Do you not purse your brows? Sir Phil. No! Lady A. No!âDo you not bite your lip? Sir Phil. No! Lady A. No? Nor clench your hand? Sir Phil. Nor clench my hand!âWhy should I? Lady A. Could you not knock him down? Sir Phil. I should like to know For what? Lady A. You would like to know for what? You are deepâ You are very deep in love. What would you do With Lady Blanche, suppose you married her? Sir Phil. Show her to court and townâgo everywhere, And take her with me, that the world might see She, that rejected scores, was won by me. Lady A. It is his vanity that loves, not he! [Aside. No enterprise of danger, then, it seems, I help you in, instructing you the way To win the heart of lovely Lady Blanche! Sir Phil. None! Lady A. Should we fail, you are a sound man still; There is no fear of dying, falling sick, Of loss of appetite, or sleep, or aught Pernicious to your comfort? Sir Phil. Not the least! Lady A. If you should fail, you fail; if win, you win! Indifferent which! Sir Phil. Nay, I would rather win! Lady A. [Aside.] You ought, that covet it so heartily! Sir Phil. Now, then, my lesson! What am I to do? Lady A. 'Tis plain she likes you not, the man you are. Sir Phil. 'Tis very plain. Lady A. Then be another man. This outlay of attireâthis garniture Of trimmings and of trinketsâlooks not well In certain women's eyes. It comes too near Themselves! Sir Phil. It does so. Lady A. Change this gear at once. Dress well, but let it be like other menâ Nothing particularâas if you'd say âLook at me, ladies! How do you like me?â What A question for a man! and do not speak Between a simper and a lisp; it shames A mouth with a beard; and don't tread mincingly: 'Tis bad enough in a woman,âwhat, then, in A man! And in the act of courtesy Give not your body such a sway, as though It were a miracle the trunk and limbs Could hold together; but in all your acts Be simple and at home. You may gain much And will lose nothing by it. Do you read? Sir Phil. Occasionally, yesâby fits and starts. Lady A. Latin and Greek? Sir Phil. I have half-forgotten them. Lady A. Would you renew your memory there with me, You are welcome. Call and let us read together. Sir Phil. Dear Lady Anne, how good you are! We are friends? Lady A. We are! Sir Phil. Then let me seal it on your hand. I am almost loath to go! Lady A. âAlmost,â no stop! Keep ever to âalmost,â you are safe enough! Sir Phil. I'll see what keeps my friend! Lady A. I'll follow you! Sir Phil. Yet, ere I go, I'll kiss your hand, once more. [Goes out. Lady A. That man has got a heart and does not know it. Nought of himself, save what his mirror shows him, He sees. His eyes are shut to what he is, Therein, where lie his nobler properties. I'll open them and make a man of him! Anne! What art thou about? Eschewest thou His sex and hold'st companionship with him? In charity!ânothing more! It would be strange If, teaching him to woo fair Lady Blanche, I chanced to cause him turn his eyes on me! At the bare thought how takes my heart alarm! Well!âCan I help it, comes it to that pass? It is his own affair! and, touching Blanche, No heartscald 'tis to her! She loves him not. My life upon it, not without some cost, Did Blanche return to sun her eyes again I' th' blushing cheek of the young jeweller! I wonder was it fancy, but I thought Sir Philip blush'd on taking leave of me. Those blushes are strange things! Upon my life, One cannot think of them, but one feels strangely! Well for him he's in love with Lady Blanche. If bad his chance with her, 'twere worse with me! And yet I doubt if love for her he feels. Love her three years, and never once fall sick, Lack appetite, lose sleepâsound sleep! no dreams To trouble it!âno hurricane of sighs. Allow another lay close siege to her And never purse his brow, nor bite his lip, Nor clench his hand as he could knock him down! He cannot be in love with Lady Blanche! [Goes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âThe Park. Enter Robert and Charlotte. Rob. This is the place!â'Tis now almost the hour! NowâLady Blanche!âforget the lady's maid, And be the countess. Bear yourself with height; Incline your head in lieu of curtseying; And that not over much! Be affluent In airs!âAs many graces as you can! Do not forget your friends, Lords John and Stephen; Let nothing trace them to the servants' room, That falls from thee! And pray you keep in mind My baronetcy!âbut through all your pride Let admiration of this coxcomb shine, As it behoves you to be smit with him! They come.âNow prove yourself an actress.âMark! We'll pass them first, then turn.âThey know their cue. Enter Stephen, John, Jacob. Steph. and Jacob [as they cross]. Good day! Rob. and Char. [very stately; crossing and going out]. Good day! John. [Stopping the others.] Is that the Countess? Steph. Don't Look back! 'Tis not the mode. We'll turn anon, The odds are ten to one they do the same. [They go out, then return; Robert and Charlotte returning at the same timeâboth parties come to a stand. Steph. Good day again, Sir Philip. Rob. Dear Lord John, It is, indeed, a fair and sunny day! Lord Stephen, how are you?âYour servant, sir! John. Mean you not to present me? Steph. Stay awhile! Char. [half-aloud to Robert]. A monstrous handsome person that, Sir Philip. John. She speaks, methinks, of me! Steph. and Jacob. Be sure she does. John. She is struck! Pray introduce me.âNothing like Clinching the nail, at once! Steph. My friend aspires To know you, Lady Blanche. Char. His grace is good! John. She takes me for a duke!âYour Ladyship O'errates, alas, my rank! I am not a duke. Char. Alas, not for your lordship, but the rank Which lacks the pride of such an ornament. John. She'll have me an earl, if I am not a duke. I can't account for this! Steph. 'Tis instinct, sir! Like natures oft find one another out! Though yet plain gentleman, I would not say But you're an earl or duke in embryo! John. I have my own forebodings thereupon; 'Twere fit I undeceived her,âwere it not? Fair lady! neither duke nor earl am I. Char. I must believe your looks against your words! John. Nay, lady, trust my words against my looks! Rob. Fair Lady Blanche, 'tis even as he says; Afflict him not with incredulity, For he is honest, even as well-favour'd! That noble presenceâfor it is, indeed, No less than noble, as the evidence Of feature, form, and bearing, clear attestâ Belongs to neither duke nor earl, but calls A commoner its owner! Char. Do you say so? Nor duke nor earl!âIs he a baronet? Rob. Nor yet a baronet! John. How very strong The feeling of my quality is upon her! Char. Who is your friend, and what? Rob. Lord John, how strangely You introduced the gentleman! I vow You never named him; so the ceremony Must be perform'd again! Fair Lady Blanche, Permit me to solicit your acquaintance For Colonel Blount. Char. For Colonel Blount!âOh, no! Rob. Indeed! indeed! Char. I can't believe it. Rob. True As I'm a baronet. Steph. Or I, a lord. Jacob. Or I, another; or as your ladyship Is Lady Blanche. Char. Deny me Lady Blanche, Deny that you are lords; Sir Philip, you That you're a baronet; but tell me not That gentleman is a colonel!âColonel!âFie! Not he! John. Does she suspect me, do you think? I have my fears! Rob. And so have I! John. Indeed! Were it not better, then, I stole away? Char. A colonel! Fie Sir Philipâfie, Lord John, Lord Stephen! Play on my credulity! Palm your friend on me for a colonel! John. Clear She penetrates the truthâI must be gone: Don't stop me, dear Sir Philip. Char. ColonelâSir, Are you a colonel? John. [Aside to Robert.] What am I to say? Rob. Put a bold face upon it!âSay at once You would not contradict her! John. [Stammering.] 'Twere offence To say I am the thing your ladyship Asserts me not to be! Char. I knew 'twas so! I knew he was no colonel! John. I'm undone! Char. A colonel!âDoes he look like one?âWhy friends, You cannot use your eyes! Your friend must be A general! John. Give me joy! I breathe again, Like one half-drown'd that's to the surface brought! I thank your ladyship for giving me So high a rank! I am a generalâ In prospect! Rob. Now, you'll do. Propose to walk, And offer her your arm. John. Let me take time, Scarce yet can I fetch breath. Rob. Love's time is ânow!â It brooks not putting off! Love's time is when It sees 'tis welcome. So you seem to be, And make your most of it. Surprise will take The fort would mock a siege! Declare yourself, And straight propose. You know the chance faint heart Runs with fair lady! John. Yes. Rob. Then profit by The adage. Sure you lack not courage. John. Courage? And with a woman!âBe there anything Wherein I have the mastery beyond All other things, 'tis courage with a woman! Your ladyship. Char. [Very stately.] Sir! [John is thrown off his guard. Steph. What is she about? Rob. Let her alone. She better knows than you. Without a little frost, a summer comes With half a welcome. Char. Sir? What would you say? I think, or I'm deceived, you spoke just now. Well, sir? John. [At a loss.] The day is marvellously fine. Char. 'Tis June, sir. John. June! So is it! Then the day May well be fine without a miracle. Char. And yet for June the day is fine. John. 'Twas that I meant to say! Char. A breezy day! John. It is A breezy day. Char. Though warm. John. Though warm. Char. A day, Methinks, to walk. Do you like walking, sir? [Putting her arm through his. John. Much, very much. It is a passion with me! I love to walkâluxuriate in a walk! And I walk well! So, please your ladyship, If there's one thing wherein I most excel, 'Tis walking. Char. I should like to learn of you. John. When? I'm ready any time. Char. Why, now; Since I have placed my armâI trust with leaveâ In yours. John. Now be it then. How proud I am To wait upon your ladyship. I live Only to please your sex. Char. You flatter us. John. Nay, Lady Blanche, 'tis simple honestyâ Mere honesty. If there's a quality Whereon, above all others, I presumeâ Char. You need not tell me, Colonel BlountâI knowâ Am sureâcould swear it. 'Tis your honesty. [They go out. SCENE II. âThe Antechamber to a Ball-Room. Enter Lady Blanche. Lady Bl. He knows me not at all!âHis memory, Far as concerns me, is a perfect blank, And in his heart not e'en a spark remains, To mind me of the love he bore me, when I seem'd a yeoman's maid. She is forgot, But I'll avenge her! and enslave his heart Before he knows his danger. Twice or thrice We spoke in passing. In his eye I saw No witness to the charms which all allow!â But soon shall he attest them to his cost. He comes!âI'll hold him, now, spite of himself; Find out his vulnerable part. All men That have free hearts are somewhere vulnerable!â Propitiate his vanity, his pride, Humourâwhate'er sways uppermost! and then Right to his heart, and win the citadel, Which, mine, who lists may take.âHe comes!âIn thought! Enter Colonel Blount. Well, Colonel Blount, I saw you dance just now. Come, sir, sit down, and tell me how you liked Your partner, sirâA special friend of mine! Col. Blount. A lady worthy praise. Lady Bl. Did you admire Her diamonds?âMine are paragons to them! [Aside. They are very rich!âPerhaps you do not care For gems?âNo more do I!âBut what of that? The world does! What are you and I against The world?âI know what you would say! One's self May be one's world, or one may light upon Another self, outweighs the world! That self When I shall find, farewell the world for me! The diamonds I could prize were shining thoughts, Mined in the heart of one that I could love! [Aside.] A shaft shot straight and should go homeâHe's struck! If struck, he should be stung! The deer is charm'd; The skill I try on him, I throw away! I'll give it over! At the first shot? No, The quiver yet is full. What ponders he? [Aloud.] Where are your thoughts, sir? Col. Blount. Lady, close at hand, Whene'er you call them to attend upon you. Lady Bl. Attendance, willing, waits not to be call'd, But still forestalls the summons, still attends! Not that I claim such servitude from one That's but my new acquaintance! By-and-by Perhaps I may be more observedâand more May wish to be so. There are scores of men Who watch my looks, to worm my wishes from them, And do them ere they are told! But what are scores, That don't include the unit which we want? Found I that unit, farewell scores of scoresâ Nay, farewell millions! It were more to me! I think the day will comeânay, I believe 'Tis nearer than I thought it yesterday, When first I made your fair acquaintance, sir! [Aside.] The man 's a stock? He cannot hear! I'll try If he can see! [Aloud.] Where are your thoughts again? Col. Blount. Here, madam, your retainers. Lady Bl. [Aside.] Such retainers Might wait upon my grandmother for me! [Aloud.] The lady's forehead you were dancing with, They say, a strong resemblance bears to mine. Does it? 'Tis not so high by half an inch. [Aside. Well, sir? Col. Blount. I am thinking, madam. Lady Bl. [Aside.] Thinking, when He should be looking! Where are the man's eyes? Poring upon his feetâand mine beside them! Col. Blount. I own I cannot see the likeness. Lady Bl. [Aside.] I Should wonder if you did! [Aloud.] I do not think Our foreheads much alikeâmine, I believe, Somewhat exceeds in height! Do you think it does? Col. Blount. I think it does, a little. Lady Bl. [Aside.] Half an inch A little in the forehead! Pshaw! He knows not What he is saying! [Aloud.] Sir, are you listening to me? Col. Blount. With all my ears! Lady Bl. Then all, I fear, all lack! [Aside.] I must transfix him with my arms! They say That that same lady has surpassing arms! Col. Blount. She wears surpassing bracelets! Lady Bl. Like you not A lady should wear bracelets? Col. Blount. I like nothing, Would supersede the handiwork of Nature! Why mask the graceful wrist? Stopp'd Nature there, Instead of going on consummately To the fair finish, what would you have said? Art is a gracious handmaid to work on, Where her high mistress, Nature, fails; but thence Is a poor critic who but shames himself Improving what's complete! Lady Bl. [Aside.] He is roused at last! I have found his vein. He shall not nod again. [Aloud.] My bracelets hurt.âThe clasps are very stiff. I pray you help me take them off! I'll never Wear them again.âNow, sir, your eyes are mine. [Aside.] Col. Blount. [Holding her hand, and contemplating the bracelet.] 'Tis wonderful! Lady Bl. [Aside.] He perches and is limed!âMy saucy linnet! How light you made just now of the poor bush, A spray of which has caught you! Col. Blount. [Still holding, &amp;c.] Art, beat that! Lady Bl. [Aside.] She can't! Col. Blount. [Still holding her hand.] Or find the thing that will comprise Such richness in ten thousand times the space! Lady Bl. [Aside.] He has found out at last I have an arm! We'll live in hopes he will find out, anon, I have a face as well! Col. Blount. Why, carats thus Might weigh almost 'gainst kingdoms. Lady Bl. [Aside.] Carats!âWhat Have arms to do with carats? Col. Blount. Multiply The grains of each of these a thousand-fold, And let the bulk grow with them, you will have The income of an empire in the space That spans this little wrist! Lady Bl. Mean you my diamonds? Sir, you were prentice to a lapidary! Col. Blount. I know I was. Lady Bl. Then, having left your craft, You should forget it. Col. Blount. 'Twas an honest one; And, though I loved it not, I blush not for it! Lady Bl. What kind of man is this?âI am forgetful! [Aside. I have been ungenerous and ask your pardon! Col. Blount. Pardon!âO no!âimpossible!âa lady Must never ask for pardon! Lady Bl. You forgive me? Col. Blount. I will when you offend me! Lady Bl. Then we are friends. Col. Blount. Then I am happy! Lady Bl. You are a soldier, sir. Tell me of your exploits. I love brave men, And hear their deeds with pleasure. Col. Blount. Had I deeds To speak of, I had rather others told them. Lady Bl. Come, sir, what is a battle? Col. Blount. Glory, madam, In a just cause; but, at the best, bought dearly When men destroy their brother men, like them Framed in the image of their common Maker! Lady Bl. You would fight again? Col. Blount. I would, to serve my country! But should be glad, she needed not such service. We must have wars, if others will provoke us, And ever then, I trust, act gallantly, As men that loathe aggression!âbut, I hope, That golden age will comeâ'tis promised us,â When men will fear their God and live like men, To brutes resigning carnage! Lady Bl. [Aside.] He o'ertowers me In all he thinks and feels;âI grow to fear him! He has his weaknesses!âwho is without them? I'll find them out! He is nothing but a man!â Soldiers live merrily, they say, in quartersâ [Aloud.] You don't refuse your glass! Col. Blount. Nor yet abuse it; Unless, perhaps a joyous time or two, When men make holiday, and open hearts Would shut, at my defectionâyet e'en then, Keep somewhat within compass!âDo believe me, And, for my credit, press me not too closely. Lady Bl. [Aside.] How honest is he! if I prove him further, I almost fear to find myself a knave! Yet I'll go on! [Aloud.]âSoldiers, I have heard, love play. You play? Col. Blount. At times; and then for the suspense That chance createsâthat mistress none can fix, Who from the sharper's clasp escapes as well As his who woos her with fair gallantry! I never gamble. Lady Bl. How can you refrain? Col. Blount. With thought of what a paltry act it is! To say the least, it never can consist With proper manhood, to enjoy the thing Was not one's own an hour ago, and chance, Not his own merit, now has won him! Then, To wax rich by another's poverty! My pillow, for the sleep, it gives me, To rob another man's!âHow could I lay My head upon it?âwhen I feast, the bread That loads my board, to leave another's bare, Ay of a crust perhaps!âHow could I touch it? To go abroad and show the generous sun My fulness, at such destitution bought, As robs that sun of light and heat to one Who yesterday rejoiced in them and bless'd them! Can he who games have feeling?âYes, he may! But better in my mind he had it not! For I esteem him preferable far, In rate of manhood, that has not a heart; To him that has, and makes vile use of it! The one is traitor unto nature, which The other can't be call'd!âWere it my lot In some unguarded moment of caprice, Forgetfulness, or aught that renders one Unlike one's selfâWere it in such a lapse My lot to win a fortuneâere I slept I must disgorge my gains, that the next day I might awake a man! Lady Bl. [Aside.] He is a man! Where am I?âWhat am I about? I fear I have found a master where I sought a slave. Heigho!âmethinks I could look up to him, Give him obedience, would he in exchange Give me his heart!âBut is it his to give? I'll try, yet fear to try!â[Aloud.] Soldiers are lovers; Some men are women-hatersâare you one? Col. Blount. I honour women. Lady Bl. But I spoke of loving. Say all men love; yet, love not all alike. Some men love lightly, others seriously, Some last, some changeâwhich way of these love you? Col. Blount. Indeed you puzzle me! Lady Bl. You are afraid To answer! Col. Blount. No!âIf you will take my answerâ I love for ever, if I love at all! Lady Bl. [Aside.] I see!âHe never loved the yeoman's maid. [Aloud.] What call you loving? Col. Blount. Blissful cherishing! Of our own happiness, that makes a casket Wherein to keep a treasured other's safe! He who loves lightly does not love at all; He only thinks he loves! Lady Bl. [Aside.] So loved he when He loved the yeoman's maid! Col. Blount. There is more of Heaven In that sweet mood than such a man e'er dream'd of! Love lightly!âLove is nothing, if its root Pierces the surface only of the heart! It must dive to the core, then what will pluck it out With fibres so embedded! It may happen The object is forgetful; but what then, If 'tis found out too late?âThe soil hath given Its richest spirits to the growthâ'Tis spent!â I don't believe that heart can love again! I am sure it cannot! Lady Bl. [Aside.] He will steal my heart Before my face, and all against my will; Nor give me hold of his.âI must break off This converse! [Aloud.] Sir, I thank you for the time You have wasted on me! We have talk'd of trifles, But pleasantlyânay, very pleasantly! You are going? A good nightâa kind good night. I am glad of your acquaintanceâwe'll shake handsâ If you please? I have tired you, have I not?âDon't answer; I know you must deny. Col. Blount. I do so frankly. Lady Bl. I thank you frankly then, and so good night. [Colonel Blount goes out. How changed I feel!âI do not know myself! Changed? He shall change! I'll bring him to his knee! I wonder what he thinks of me? I'll plan A snare for him, shall show me.âHe did not kiss My hand!âand, when I gave it him, almost I held it to his lips!âOne thing is certain, The yeoman's maid is free to love for him! How I deceived myself, to think, one moment, The man was any other than a man! How very soon I have disabused myself! To-morrow shall unfold!ânot kiss my hand! I could have sworn he would have kiss'd my hand! [Goes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âThe House of Lady Anne.âA Room. Enter Lady Anne. Lady A. He thrives beyond my hopes! Leave an old maid Alone to make a man, reforming him After the fashion, likes her. Women prate Who talk of conquest while they stoop to love! What's sway for sway but mere equality Wherein the party least deserves to ruleâ And that, past all dispute, is man, the lord!â Ne'er rests till he disturbs the perfect poise, Into his own scale throws his mightâthat good Wherein the brute hath mastery o'er himâ And to the beam heaves up the counter one, To hang there at his will!âHad women but The thews of men! My very girlhood solved The riddle of their sovereignty!âBrought up With two male cubs of cousins, was not I A likely one the relative deserts Of women and of men to put to proof? And didn't I?âI beat them to a stand! We started all together! Where were they When I could read?âWhy, in the spelling-book! When I was in subtraction where were they? A cudgelling their brains to cast a sum Of ten lines in addition! I could rhyme My tables backwards, while they fought with pounds, Shillings and pence, that kept the upper hand And laugh'd at them for masters! I could parse, While they on footing of most shy acquaintance Kept with their parts of speech! In one thing only I found I met my bettersâand e'en there I tried them, though I came off second bestâ I could not beat them when they quarrell'd with me! Because they held my hands!âThey were afraid To fight me!âBut Sir Philip thrives apace, And all of my performing!âAnd what pains He takes to please me, with his air, his gait, His dress, and most of all his books! How fond He is of study! I'll do all I can To encourage him!âAt last, he'll make a man! Enter Jane. Well, Jane. Jane. One asks to see your ladyship, Whose forward manners call his years most backward. He looks but twenty, may you trust his chin, But should be thirty and no minute wasted. He told his will, nor gave me time to answer, But, making of his arms a pillory, Began to kiss me, madam! Smack on smack, Quick as the clapper of the 'larum bell, That ne'er gives o'er before the weight is down, Like him who still held on, till out of breath! Lady A. Hadst not a tongue, girl, to let loose upon him? Jane. I had, my lady; but my lips were stopp'd. Lady A. But when your lips were free! Jane. The harm was done! Lady A. I will not see him! Jane. He is at the door! Lady A. Shut it! Go ring the bell! Lady Bl. [Entering, disguised as a man.] And if she does, I'll ring the changes on her lips again. Lady A. Go call my footmen! Lady Bl. If she bears them spite,â For I shall trounce them soundly, if they come; I'll ring the bell; but mark the consequence, Footmen or maids, I'll kiss you spite of them, Before their faces! Be they maids that come, I'll kiss the maids as well.âYou see my mood; So, be you squeamish, take me by yourself And leave the bell alone! Jane. Shall I ring, my lady? Lady A. No, don't! Lady Bl. You hear!âYou mark?âYou know your cue? You have not been yon lady's maid in vain? You're of no use!âWhy loiter here!âBegone! Lady A. I can command my maid myself! Lady Bl. You can! But better, now, that I command than you; For on rebellion clearly is she bent, Seeing her absence leaves us two alone! By all the arrows ever Cupid shot, By all the hearts that ever rued his bow, Thou art jealous of thy mistress! Jane. Sir! Lady Bl. Thou art! Thou wouldst we still were standing in the hall; Thou wouldst my errand there were still to tell; Thou wouldst the vails I gave thee in advance Were still to payâyea, thou wouldst give them back To have them paid again! I am willingâbut There is a timeâthere is a placeâand this Is neither place, nor timeâavoid thee, then! For, were my love the fraught of twenty men, Yet of one man I cannot well make two, And though the lady's beauty tracks the maid's, Yet must the lady's self precedence take! So, Fondness!âleave the room!âNay thenâ Jane. [Retreating from Lady Blanche.] I am gone. [Goes out. Lady A. How Wrong may thrive by sheer audacity, While, with amaze, Propriety gives way Before the thing she scorns! Lady Bl. Give me a kiss! Lady A. A kiss!âI never yet gave kiss to man! Lady Bl. You have kiss'd me many a time! Women forget Their girlhood days! Their lofty age o'erlooks Such tiny things! Lady A. Kiss'd thee! Lady Bl. When we have stroll'd Along green lanes in honeysuckle time, With thrilling throats, mocking the merry birds; When we have chased each other 'mong the sheaves, Whose ears have lent us gold to make us crowns; When, forced to keep the house in winter, of Our plays we have made fires to warm ourselves; Or when we have coax'd spring on with primroses, Till hedge-rows leaved, and trees were all a-bloom! I have kiss'd thee all these times, not to recount How often we have sat on the same chair, Or made a chair of one another's lap, On the same carpet roll'dâslept in one bed! Lady A. [Shrieks.] Ah! Lady Bl. You may shriek.âThere was no shrieking thenâ In short, were comites more than hand or glove, For still were we together!âKiss me, Anne! Lady A. Hoa! help! Lady Bl. Why don't you know me, simpleton? Lady A. Blanche! Lady Bl. [Bowing.] At your service. Lady A. What may this forebode? Lady Bl. Why, victory! I cannot tell thee now I came to put my masquerade to proof! Lady A. 'Tis excellent! Lady Bl. And so, in verity You took me for a man! Lady A. In verity. Lady Bl. The dress becomes me?âEh? Lady A. To admiration! Lady Bl. Is not my carriage very like a man's? Have I not caught his tyrant strut? Lady A. You have! Lady Bl. The style with which he bears his empty head? Lady A. You have! Lady Bl. His frown when he would scare a man? Lady A. You have! Lady Bl. His smile when he would please a woman? Lady A. You have! Lady Bl. When thus I poise me on one foot, Planting at ease the other, with one hand In my breast, the other at my side, with arm Akimbo, say, you were not in my secret, Would you not take your oath I was a man? Lady A. I would! Lady Bl. 'Twill do! Kiss me, dear Anne, again! Lady A. I hear a step. Lady Bl. Keep quiet, will you, Anne! Jane. [Running on.] MadamâO la! [Stopping short at seeing Lady Anne with her head on Lady Blanche's shoulder, while Lady Blanche kisses her. Lady Bl. How envy stops her breath! You need not goâWe do not mind youâWell! Your errandâif you have one? Much I doubt 'Twas jealousy that brought you back again! Lady A. [Still lolling on Lady Blanche.] What is it, Jane? Lady Bl. You see we're quite at home With one another. Well, what is it, sweetheart! Jane. Sir Philip Brilliant waits to see my lady. Lady Bl. Show him up stairs. Jane. Well, if I ever dream'dâ Lady Bl. She scarce can move for very spiteâBegone! [Jane goes out. Lady A. What shall be done? Lady Bl. Done?âLet them show him up! I am sure I make as good a man as he is! How changed Sir Philip is!âHow grave he grows! I half believe my empire there is done!â Why staid you yester' evening from the ball?â I ne'er saw man so alter'd as Sir Philip! He thinks! He does! Looks pensive, as I live! What brings him here, dear Anne? Lady A. [Hesitating.] To learn of me. How to make love to you. Lady Bl. Learn to make love To me! How long since you have open'd school? You ne'er gave lesson on that art, before! But wit does wonders, on emergency!â Anne!âThey say teachers learn the while they teach! Take care!âAmercy, where's your old maid's dress? What do you teach Sir Philip? Lady A. We read Latin Together. Lady Bl. Anne!âI can translate your Latin Better than you can. Here your pupil comes! Enter Sir Philip. An o'ergrown boy, methinks, to go to school! But such a one, if once he takes to tasks, Makes progress.âPays he thee in coin or kind? Coin!âNo such item in the schedule broad Of love's estate, composed of things as light As sunshine!âair!âthe odour air exhales! The softest sound it lends its limber wing! Not that it always, yet, escheweth things More tangible, begot of hands and lips! Farewell! I never saw so clear a dawn! Lady A. Dawn? It is day. Lady Bl. 'Tis dawn, will grow to day! I tell thee, Anne, 'twas e'en Aurora's self That now I spiedâthat early, modest maid, Who opes the curtains of the sleeping sun, And, blushing, flies his gaze! Permit my lips To press your hand.âNow, mark my bow! [Aside.] Adieu! [Lady Blanche bows to Sir Philip, and goes out. Sir Phil. [Uneasily.] A handsome youth! Lady A. Umph! Well enough! Sir Phil. He seems An old acquaintance, for he kiss'd your hand Right lovingly! Lady A. I have known him rather long. Sir Phil. I would I had not come! Lady A. Why, prithee? Sir Phil. As My call was out of time. Lady A. Not so, Sir Philip, The gentleman was just about to go. Sir Phil. I am glad I came not sooner. Lady A. Had you, sir, 'Twere all the same to meâsave that the pleasure Of seeing you had been some minutes older! Sir Phil. You make me happy. Lady A. What's the matter with him? Sir Philip cannot be in love with me! Yet Lady Blanche would so insinuateâ Hang her! To note my cheek!âIt had not burn'd Except through her!âWhy, what a world it is! What wicked thoughts come into people's heads! Behoves I watch myself!âWe meet too often! We are too much aloneâO far too much! His tasks must end, if he begins to love! He has not told me so!âI'll wait till then! I wonder was he pensive, as she said! Or did she fancy it? Sir Philip. Sir Phil. Madam? Lady A. I pray you, how went off the ball last night? Sir Phil. Oh, admirably well! Lady A. I knew it! She Was jesting! I hate jests! Nine times in ten They are out of season! 'Twas a pleasant evening? Sir Phil. Very! Lady A. I knew it!âWhat can change a man In a moment!âCan he doff himself as soon As his coat? The days of miracles are over! And so you pass'd a very pleasant evening? Whom danced you withâthe Countess? Sir Phil. Nobody. Lady A. You play'd at cardsâwho was your partner? She? Sir Phil. No one. Lady A. They gave you music?âYou can sing: I have heard you sing a second to the Countessâ A capital second!âI was pleased with it, That am not moved with trifles!âDid you sing Last night together? Sir Phil. No; I sang with no one. Lady A. A solo then? Sir Phil. I did not sing at all! Lady A. Singing is very well in its way; but many Love conversation better. Sir Phil. Very many! Lady A. For mine own part, give me a corner with A friend I love to talk with, and the song May hold its peace for me! Sir Phil. I feel as you do! Lady A. The Countess can talk well. Sir Phil. Surprisinglyâ Lady A. When she likes it. Was she in the vein last night? Sir Phil. I did not note!âI saw not much of her. I was not in the vein for company. Lady A. Pray you, Sir Philip, who were at the ball? Sir Phil. Upon my word, I scarce remember who! I better could recall who was not there! Lady A. Who was not there? Sir Phil. Why, you! Lady A. [Aside.] That sounds like love! 'Tis well I be upon my guard in time! Repel the foe, before he can make head! Yet to be like a thing is not to be The thing itself! It may not, yet, be love. The enemy I take up arms against Myself may conjure up!âalarums sound, Where no attack is meant?âThat would be hard On him!âto lose, without a crime, the friend He stands so much in need ofâthen the credit I must forego, if I forego the task I took in hand, to make a man of him! See how he cons his lesson like a boy! [Aloud.] Get the desk readyâI shall follow you. Sir Phil. Here is a passage, like to master me. Each word I know, yet can't divine the sense! Lady A. Show it me. Dear Sir Philip, you forget Your syntax! Here is an ellipsis, sir! Sir Phil. An ellipsis? Lady A. Yes; look at that genitive! It stands alone! What governs it, Sir Philip? Sir Phil. The noun is understood!âI have found the sense; Yet wits more quick, miss seeing things as plain! [Sighs. Lady A. [Aside.] What does he mean? Sir Phil. The want is profit to me, That makes me need instructress, such as you are, And wins her for meâthrough compassion, only! I progress!âWill gets through a heap of work! Dear Lady Anne, I love to read with you! [Goes out. Lady A. He loves to read with me! Were it charity If that I construed into loving me? He stands too much in awe of me to love me! But, say he doesâwhat business is't of mine? Let him look to itâI have not the fever! He caught it not from me! I'm in sound health, Was never half so well! My mind sees clearer! My heart feels lighter. I am twice myselfâ He loves not any one!âor if he does, 'Tis clear as open day 'tis not the Countess! [Goes out. SCENE II. âColonel Blount's House.âA Room. Enter Colonel Blount. Col. Blount. Mine honour'd parents have I seen at last! Received their welcome with their blessing crown'd! My brother mocks my searchâand so does she Whom to have lost, makes loss of fortune's gains. Nor hope nor clue to hope! The house, whereat We used to meet, hath other tenant got, The former gone they know not whither,âif Alive or dead! For hours and hours I walk The streets in vain! she never crosses me. I light on all the world but her I seek! Enter William. Wil. A gentleman would speak with you. Col. Blount. His name? Wil. I ask'd his name, and in reply he told me Again his errandâwonder'd how my master Could keep a male attendant at his door, And maids to hire in bunches!âany one Of whom could draw the bolt as well!âwould look A thousand times more pleasingâspeak more sweetly, And, maybe, when a pretty fellow call'd, With kisses season answersâthen with a stamp Dismiss'd me. Lady Bl. [Entering, still disguised.] Colonel Blount, your humble servant! Place chairs! excuse the freedom! I am at home Whene'er I light upon a gentleman; And you, I know, are one!âYou know your place, sir, And know, of course, the way to itâwhich, as I take it, is the hall!âyou understand me? The hall! [William goes out.] Your servant, Colonel Blount, again! Col. Blount. You know me, sir? Lady Bl. A man beloved of fame, sir, Is known to many, who are strange to him. I own that I make bold! but keep your frown Until I give my reason. Colonel Blount, Some men make bold through fear, some through the lack on't. Some to seem honestâfor the adage runs, That knavery puts on a glossy suit While honesty goes rough!âand some make bold Through lightness of clear hearts, and wantonness Of healthy frankness!âI am such a man! To free your mind at once from jealousy, If not to win your confidence, I tell you I wait on youâtouching a lady, sir!â He takes it very coolly. [Aside.] Colonel Blount, I wait on you, touching a lady, sir! Col. Blount. I heard you, sirâI am not deaf. Lady Bl. [Aside.] As well Be deaf as dull. The lady, sir, I am sure, By certain signs affects youâand, aware How through reserve, or self mistrust, or something, Hearts, form'd to mingle, oft miss one another; And being of the lady's blood moreover, And knowing you, by fame, a man of honour, The secret I have guess'd, sir, I have come To tell you, sir. Col. Blount. Well, sir? Lady Bl. [Aside.] The man 's a stock! âWell, sir!ââshall I go on? I will!âbut only Because I have begun. Whom reckon you The beauty of the court? Col. Blount. The beauty? Lady Bl. [Off her guard.] Well? Col. Blount. Your patience, sir, I am not skill'd in beauty; Perhaps I may mistake. Lady Bl. [Again off her guard.] You do not know The beauty of the court? Col. Blount. To say the truth, I lay light value upon beauty only. Then is it hard to say what beauty is. You like the Roman outline, I the Grecianâ Where's beauty? Beauty, may I trust report, Hath somewhat questionable reputation, too! Some say it is intolerably proud; Some, emptyâfull of nothing but itself; Some, by no means good-temper'dâsome assert 'Tis mercenary, and not over honest. This may, in part, be spleen, but part is truth. Whence am I jealous of what men call beauty; And own itâbut when beauty, modestly, Attends the mind, like a fair handmaiden Who knows her place, and serves a noble mistress, Then could I worship beauty, sir; for then Its proper worth not only doffs no favour, But wins enhancement from the worth it waits on! Lady Bl. Had you not, Colonel Blount, some time or other, A falling out with beauty? Come! You had; She slighted you, one timeâI know she did! But 'twas your own faultâI'll be bound it was! You did not manage well, sir. You were proudâ Lack'd patienceâmaybe, artâand, never dreaming That beauty's smiles go oft in masquerade, Took one for a frown, and off!âwhen, had you tarried, The thing you thought a frown had proved a smile, As the dull morning breeds the sunny day. I know the sex! There is not one of them But's art in something! Col. Blount. Do not say, not one! Lady Bl. [Forgetting herself.] I say, not one! What know you of the sex? What knows this manâthat manâor any manâ Of the sex? Is it not plain to all the world, A girl, at fifteen is, in wit a woman? And what's a man at twenty but a boy? When I was only thirteenâ Col. Blount. Sir!â Lady Bl. Nay, sir, Don't interrupt me!âWhen I was but thirteenâ [Recovering herself. I had an aunt who loved me passing well, And lest I should be overmatch'd by women, School'd me in all their arts.âYou never had An aunt like her, nor any other man. Whence I disparaged youâI beg your pardon! Col. Blount. 'Tis granted freely. Lady Bl. I am beholden to you; And, more to be so, would entreat you own, If when I challenged you to name just now The beauty of the court, you entertain'd not Suspicion of the lady? Col. Blount. Not the least! Lady Bl. Why, Colonel Blount, you are not blind! You know Who has the fairest skin, the finest hairâ The finest features, finest shoulders, arms And wrists, and hands. Col. Blount. Stop, sir! Lady Bl. I meant to stop; For if by these you fail to recognise her, The lady's waist, her ancles, and her feet Were thrown away upon you! Col. Blount. I but stopp'd you To say I know the Countess, Lady Blanche! Lady Bl. Well, sir? Col. Blount. Well, sir? Lady Bl. I come on her account. Col. Blount. You are welcome, sir, upon your own account! Your pleasure? Lady Bl. [Aside.] I could brain him, so I could! [Aloud.] She is the lady whom I spoke of, sir!â [Aside.] Oh, marble! Is it true you see and hear? I'll speak out plainly! [Aloud.] Sir, I think 'tis time The Countess married?âWhat think you? Col. Blount. Indeed I never thought about it! Lady Bl. [Aside.] I could sell him To slavery!â'Tis a fine lion, though, Of which I'd give my eyes to have the taming! [Aloud.] I think 'tis time a woman marries when She takes a fancy to a man! Col. Blount. That plight, Methinks, can scarce befal the Countess, sir! The lady is enamour'd of herself! She cannot love another! Lady Bl. [Aside.] I could be The death of him. [Aloud.] What would you wager now, She is not in love with you? You know the signs A woman is in love? She has them all, sir! Thinks much, speaks little, sighs incontinently, Falls off in appetite, hates company, Shuns pleasure, loves to pass the time alone, Makes of one hand a pillow for her cheek, One, for her heart, of the otherâsitting thus For hours together!âIs not that the picture Of one in love? And if you come to tears, She could weep rivers, would sheâbut give me The drop, could turn into a flood, but won'tâ Hangs on the lid, as though 'twould fall, but doesn't; Seems as 'twould ever stay there, but is gone You know not how nor whither! Col. Blount. You surprise me! I saw the Countess at the ball last nightâ Look'd never woman better! Lady Bl. Look'd!â Col. Blount. I know She paints. Lady Bl. Paints, sir? Col. Blount. She does! 'Tis clear As that she breathes and moves. Lady Bl. Does that offend you? Col. Blount. Sir, I'll be frank! I love not simulation, Nor can believe it may be practised safely E'en in as small a thing as that we speak of! 'Tis well when she who paints confesses it; Yet she confesses vanity besides, Which is not well. But, for the other sort, Women who pass a cheek for what it is not; I always fear'd the probity, within, Would follow that without; and thoughts and words Might wear a hue that was not native to them. For, if one fraud will blast a character, What follows but that honesty is perfect, Or nothing?âholds throughout?âis everywhere Or nowhere?âI refer to actions!â'Tis Their actions which determine what men are! Whate'er of me men see, must be myself; What I myself can seeâI do not mean To advertise my heartâthat is no man's dutyâ I have my weakness, I'm not bound to ownâ Before it masters me!âbut, by my honour, I take no credit for the grace I have not! Lady Bl. [Aside.] 'Tis a strange man!âa man of a new species! [Aloud.] Well, sir, she paints!âWhat else?âWhat other fault Do you find with her face? Her colour you dispute,â Perhaps you'll grant her eyes to be her own, And they are counted fine ones! Col. Blount. They are bold ones! Lady Bl. Bold ones!âYou do not like their fire, perhaps? You should not, could it scorch you! [Aside. Col. Blount. Not their fire Do I complain of. 'Tis the mood that lights it I quarrel with! Lady Bl. What mood? [Aside.] I grow to hate him! Col. Blount. The mood of the coquetteâwhom on my honour I hold 'mongst women an anomaly! For, much as you disparaged woman, now, Making her creature more or less of art; I think, if not in her, then nowhere, else, Is truthful nature found; for she is framed Of elements she needs not blush to own, Being of the temper less of earth than heaven! And which, perforce, establish her sincereâ Pitifulâmodestâand, surpassing all, Single in love, which is Heaven's prototype! Her love is love! Therein she is a barque Sea-worthy 'gainst all weathers!âlikelier Than any prow, that ever quitted port, To make her voyage, whatsoe'er the wind, And, if it blows, to ride the tempest through! Lady Bl. He is not so bad! How handsome look'd he now, More than his features warrant him, as though The charm of beauty lay not in the face! Col. Blount. Now, what has a coquette, to such a being Pertaining? Form and feature! Nothing more! Of woman the least part! She cannot love; For woman, loving, cannot breathe or move, Or think, or feel, but love 's in all she does! And, saying that she cannot love, say what She can do, to her honour will redound? I know not, sir; do you? Lady Bl. [Aside.] Yes; she can hate, And heartily.âWhy, what a fright I took For a good-looking man! Col. Blount. The Countess nowâ Lady Bl. So please you, we shall speak no more about her! [Aside.] I wonder is he smit with any otherâ [Aloud.] Excuse a question, sir!âAre you in love? Col. Blount. Yes, sir, I amâbut love, I fear, in vain. Lady Bl. [Aside.] In vain? Some prude, perhaps, has snared his heart. I hope she has! [Aloud.] Is not your love return'd? Col. Blount. I know not!âI would fain believe it was! Lady Bl. Believe it was?âWhat! dropp'd she never word That Hope could make a meal of? Col. Blount. Never.âSilence Was still her answer when I press'd my suit. Lady Bl. A prude, as I'm alive! a thorough prude! I know what kind of maid your mistress is! She keeps you at great distance!âplucks away Her hand, if you press itâif you strive to keep Her waist in durance, sets the measure of The room 'twixt you and her; and would you kiss her, Prepares to shriek!âYou should make trial of her! She understands your humour! I'll be bound It is a prude you love! Col. Blount. You wrong her, sir! She is no prude! No freedomâyou have named I ever took with her, or dared to take! Lady Bl. Or dared to take! I told you, Colonel Blount, You knew not women. Dragons, sir, are fables! So used my aunt to sayâand she went further; Where'er you think you see one, set it down 'Tis whalebone-work and buckram; which, without The fear of sting or flame, you may engage, And find more peace than you imagined fury! Dear Colonel Blount, you love a prude, and think You have found a miracle of modesty! Col. Blount. No more, sir! Lady Bl. Colonel Blount, you love a prude! 'Tis ever thus with men particular; Men that in squeamishness would outdo women! That knit a brow at this, and shrug at that, Take shocks at horrors that amount to nothing; Whom nothing will content except perfection, Which, when at last they find,âthey find they are losers By many a better thing they met before, And pass'd in chase of it! I give you joy, sir, To love a prude. Col. Blount. Nay, sirâ Lady Bl. Yea, sir; a prude! I see her!âShe's before me!âJust the eyes, I know she has!âthe use she makes of them! How fond they are of the ground! I warrant you Her thoughts are not of their taste!âGentle primness! There is a mouth after your own chaste fancy! Look at the lips how they hug one another, Like innocents that cling at thought of parting!â If I were near them!âWhat a sober cheek! Durst ever laughter come there?âI'll be bound When 'tis alone, or keeping company With one that understands it! Colonel Blount, I'll court your mistress, and I'll carry her In a week! She is a prude, fair Colonel Blount! Col. Blount. Hold, sir!âOn no account that bears not proof Asperse the character of her I love! Say that I boast because I think her fair, She can spare beauty! 'Tis her least desert! But when, in wantonness, you doubt her heart, Wherein do I, in seriousness, confideâ Which to her beauty is, what, to the earth, The sun!âthe radiant fountain, gives it light; You tax my patience past what it can bear, And all the man in me is up in arms! Lady Bl. [Aside.] 'Tis plain he lovesâand oh!âhow well he loves! What is't to me? I feel a sickness which I never felt before! The world I'd give To see the woman that has conquer'd him; I would I were away!âMy feignÃ©d part I have play'd too long, can scarce keep up, and wish, And heartily, I ne'er had play'd at all! Up heart and bear me through!â[Aloud.] Good day, fair sir, I thank you for the audience you've vouchsafed! But wish you had not loved a prude! Col. Blount. [Drawing.] 'Sdeath, sir! Lady Bl. [alarmed]. Stop!â[Recovering.] Draw upon me under your own roof! Col. Blount. I am corrected! You must pardon me; But, to keep patience, I must quit the room. Lady Bl. Farewell, sirâbut, believe me, you will find The lady is a prude! Col. Blount. Away, sir! [Goes out. Lady Bl. Prude! Jilt, shrew, whate'er she is, would I were she! [Goes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âThe House of Lady Anne. Enter Jane and Lady Blanche. Lady Bl. At home to me! Why not at home to all? What ails her? Is she ill? When saw she last Sir Philip? Jane. Yesterday. Lady Bl. He was not here To-day? They have quarrell'd. She's in love with him. I thought 'twould come to this. Play governess To a pupil with a beard! Pore cheek-by-cheek Over a book with him! A score to one The cheeks would meet. I wonder, then, the odds The lips would keep asunder. Jane. You have guess'd it. Lady Bl. He kiss'd her? How know you? Jane. I saw it, madam, Entering the study unawares. Their backs Were towards me. They were sitting, side by side, Before the reading-desk, and as I oped The door, he kiss'd her. She was on her feet In a moment. Lady Bl. At the kiss or at the door? Jane. I'll not be positive. Lady Bl. But you can guess. Or if you cannot, I can.âShe turn'd round. And then she quarrell'd with the kissâGo to! You have made mischief. 'Twere a welcome kiss, Had not you look'd upon it. Get you gone, You have wicked eyes! Go send your lady to me. [Jane goes out. My heart is gone! The symptoms yesterday I feign'd, I feel to-day. To mock, to catch! So runs the saying, and 'tis true. I mock'dâ Dissembled love for the young 'prentice boy, And what I pass'd before for, now I amâ A maid indeed in loveâin love with him Who, having leap'd the pale that bade him dwell Aloof from gentle blood, were now my match; But he has all forgot the yeoman's maid. Lady Blanche sits disconsolately. Enter Lady Anne who draws a chair beside her, and likewise sits. Lady A. Well, Blanche. Lady Bl. Well, Anne. You have quarrell'd with Sir Philip. Lady A. And you have lost your pains with Colonel Blount. Lady Bl. We have play'd our cards like fools. Lady A. I fear we have. Lady Bl. I know we have. My game is gone. Lady A. And so I fear is mine. Lady Bl. Why, Anne, you're not in love? Lady A. I doubt I am. Are you in love, dear Blanche? Lady Bl. I know I am. What could possess you, Anne, To set yourself up at an age like yours For an old maid? Would you be wiser than Your mother was? Had she been of your mind, Where had you been? Lady A. What could possess you, Blanche, To give me credit for't, and you yourself A woman? Think you there was ever one Who led a life of single blessedness, And with her will? Blanche, you forgot your mother, As I did mine. Children had better take Example from their parents. They are copies More like to spoil than mend by altering. Lady Bl. My mother was a wife at twenty-four. Past that, I'm like to be no wife at all. This comes of scorning men. How could you think Women were e'er design'd to live without them? Look at men's trades, no woman e'er could follow. A pretty smith you'd make, to blow a bellows And set an anvil ringing with a hammer. Lady A. Or you a pretty mason, with a mallet Shaping a block of freestone with a chisel! Lady Bl. You could not be a doctor, nor a surgeon. Lady A. Nor you a lawyerâwould you wear the wig? Lady Bl. I'd starve first. You would never make a sailor. Lady A. Nor you a soldier. Lady Bl. I could fight. I'd like To fight with Colonel Blount. Lady A. What! has he chafed you? Lady Bl. Mortally! Of my beauty made as light, As 'twere a dress would only wear a day! Averr'd I painted, which, although I did, Designing not to show, how durst he see? Denied that I had eyes. Have I not eyes? Call'd me coquette, anatomized me so, My heart is all one mortifying sore. Rankling with pain, which, 'gainst all equity, I pay him for with love, instead of hate. Lady A. Why, Blanche, can it be you? Lady Bl. Can you believe That love could be constrain'd? That one could love Against one's will? That one could spite one's self To love another? Love and hate at once? I could kill Colonel Blountâcould hack him up! Make mincemeat of himâand could kill myself For thinking I could do it, he is so full Of wisdom, goodness, manliness, and grace! I honour him, admire him, yea, affect him; Yet, more than him, affect the 'prentice boy, Whose blushing cheek attested for his heart That love was an unknown, unlook'd-for guest, Ne'er entertain'd before; and greeted, now, With most confused, overpow'red welcome! Lady A. You loved the 'prentice boy!âyou thought not that Before. Lady Bl. Because it seem'd too slight for thought. A spark I did not heed, because a spark, Never suspected could engender flame, Has kept in secret kindling, not found out Until the blaze that, now, keeps raging on, As from the smother springs the fiercest fire. Lady A. Well! make confession to him. Lady Bl. Make my will And die! He loves no more! The fire is out! Vanish'd!âThe very embers blown away! The memory even of my features gone, At sight of which it bursts with such a glare As crimson'd all the welkin of his face, And mock'd, as you would think, extinguishing! Nor rests it thereâanother fire is lit And blazes to another deity! There is the altar, burn'd before for me, But to another does the incense rise. There is the temple where I once was shrined, But to another's image sacred now; And mine profaned, unbased, cast down, cast out, Never to know its worshipper again! Lady A. Thou dost not weep. Lady Bl. I do! Lady A. You are in love! Lady Bl. To be sure I am. O! never women more Deceived themselves than we did! To believe It rested with ourselves to love or not; As we, at once, could have and lack a heart; As though we were not made of flesh and blood; As though we were not womenâwomenâskiffs Sure to be toss'd by passion as by waves The barque that's launch'd into the open sea! Why don't you weep?âyou would for sympathy, Did you but love as I do. Lady A. Love as you do! The loves of twenty women would not make The heap of mine. Lady Bl. And mine among the number? Now look you, Anne, the moiety of my love Would make your heap. Lady A. Would make my heap? Its tithe Would beat your moiety! Lady Bl. The measure of it? Lady A. The earth! Lady Bl. I'll give thee in the sun and moon! My love holds measure with the universe! That mocks all bounds. Lady A. Ne'er woman loved as I do! Lady Bl. Ne'er woman loved at all, compared to me! In me the passion, Anne, is nature! What I feel, you only have a notion of. I love by heart; you only, Anne, by rote! Peace, I will have it so! Upon my life We are a pair of most renown'd old maids! Enter Jane. Jane. So please you, madam, have I now your leave? Lady A. Leave!âWhither go you?âOh, I had forgot. I gave her leave to spend the afternoon With Charlotte, your fair maid. Lady Bl. She gives a treat To-day. She begg'd of me a room or two; I bade her take the freedom of the house, And with her friends keep holiday, for she My foster-sister is, as well as maid! Lady A. Is't not a wedding, Jane? Jane. I am bound, my lady, To secrecy. Lady A. Pshaw! secrecy to me? Jane. It is a wedding. Lady A. And whom marries she? Jane. They tell me Colonel Blount. Lady Bl. They slander him! It is impossible! Lady A. You have your leave! Go, Jane. [Jane goes out. Lady Bl. [Calling after Jane.] But go not forthâwait in the ante-room For me! Behoves I further question her! Lady A. Would you betray yourself? Lady Bl. Betray myself!â I have betray'd myselfâI am betray'd By him, by you,âbut, most of all, myself! There's no accounting for the tastes of men!â I'll see this wedding! Lady A. Wherefore? Lady Bl. Know I not!â To stop the banns! Lady A. Play rival to thy maid? Lady Bl. The maid is betters to the mistress now! I must be present at these nuptials, Anne! I think it cannot be as she reports! And yet, again, I doubt, and fear it is! If so, I'll see him give away his hand, And to escape detection from the rest, Attire me as the maid he knew me firstâ The yeoman's daughter whom he saw and loved. Follow me, Anne, and see how all will end. Lady A. What profit can it bring thee, proves it he? Lady Bl. I know not what! I scarce know what I do. I have an aim, yet know not what it is! I shall expect you, Anne.âBe sure you come! Anne, turns it out, as much I fear it will, You'll have to answer for't. Lady A. For what, dear Blanche? Lady Bl. That I should love, and die a lost old maid. [Lady Blanche goes out. Lady A. Full of her own predicament, she casts No thought on mine. What will become of me, Returns not fair Sir Philip to the charge, Dishearten'd by repulse which I confess I gave him more in show than earnestness? That's he!âI know his step!âCome in, Sir Philip! Enter Sir Philip. Sir Phil. I have made bold to call. Lady A. I see you have call'd; I do not see you have made bold! Sir Phil. I came To ask your pardon. Lady A. Oh!âfor yesterday. Yes! I was angry!âyou surprised me so! It was not what you did, but how you did it. And then my maid to see it!âWhat knew she How you intended it?âSuch thingsâyou know I view them philosophicallyâgo For what they are meant for. There is a father's kiss, A brother's kiss, a friend's kissâand a kissâ Of another kind.âYou guess the kind I meanâ Not like the kiss you gave me yesterday. Sir Phil. I am not sure of that.âNay, I'll be honest! Lady A. Do so, Sir Philip! Honesty is a grace That makes amends for worlds of awkward things. Sir Phil. With safety, would I might be honest still. Lady A. You cannot tell, you know, unless you try! Sir Phil. Trying, perhaps I fail. Lady A. Perhaps succeed. But trying not, be sure you won't succeed. Sir Phil. Dear Lady Anne, I feelâI know not what. Lady A. I cannot know unless you tell me what. How do you feel? Sir Phil. Most strangely. Lady A. And how long? Sir Phil. Why ever since I came to school to you. I am smitten, Lady Anne. Lady A. What mean you, sir? Smitten by me? I have not got the plague! I don't feel ill!âCan I be ailing, sir? Do you think me ill?âDo you know anything About the pulse? Feel mine! How am I? Sir Phil. Nay, Allow me time to tell. Lady A. O! take your time! Sir Phil. A most sweet hand you have, dear Lady Anne. Here is a palm, and here are fingers too! Lady A. I hope there are. Sir Phil. And joints. Lady A. Who has not palms, Fingers, and joints, Sir Philip, that has hands? Sir Phil. But hands that have all these are not the same! Some will repel, and some attract the touch! Some will delight, and some offend, the eye. This palm hath softness, which the eider-down Were richer if it knew! Those tapering fingers Are in their dazzling whiteness, and their shape, Rays far more precious than e'er crown'd a star, That penetrate the heart with light and warmth In which the sun is poor!âand here are joints That mock the cheek with dimplesâplay on smilesâ As hinges could be fashion'd of such things! O there's a world of riches in a hand! Treasures that count with feeling, thought, and sense, And most of allâin this one. Lady A. Pray, Sir Philip, How is my pulse? Sir Phil. I cannot find your pulseâCan't tell the pulseâ Know nothing of the pulse.âYou are quite well; But I am very ill, dear Lady Anne. Lady A. Indeed! Sir Philip. Let me try my skill!â The hand keeps steady while we feel the pulseâ No signs of ailment here. Sir Phil. No fever? Lady A. No: The even-plodding beat of sober health! And yet thou mayst be ill.âArt rheumatic? Sir Phil. No. Lady A. Art thou subject to the quinsey? Sir Phil. No. Lady A. Feel'st rigors now and thenâthe certain signs Of brooding mischief! Sir Phil. No. Lady A. Hadst ever threat'ning Of a lock'd jaw? Sir Phil. No! Lady A. Hast thou got a headache? Sir Phil. No! Lady A. If thou'rt ill, it must be somewhere! How Feel'st thou about the region of the heart? Sir Phil. 'Tis there, dear Lady Anne; 'tis there! Lady A. What's there? Sir Phil. My illness! Lady A. What, suspect you, is it? Sir Phil. Love! Lady A. A dunce!âI might have known it all along!â Of course!âyou are in love with Lady Blanche! Sir Phil. Nay, Lady Anne, I am in love with you! Lady A. In love with me! Why, what can I have done To make you so? Sir Phil. Nothing, with that intent, But everything that works to such an end! Made meâfrom nothingâwhich I was,âa man! Almost a manâyour work not yet complete, But you will crown it, if you marry me. Lady A. Sir Philip, we shall speak another time. Sir Phil. That other time will find another yet! No time like the present, when the cause is good. And the heart cheerily runs along with it! Lady A. Give me a day! Sir Phil. What! with such friends as these To back me now? Lady A. What friends? Sir Phil. Your blushes, lady, You fain would hide, but cannot!âand your eyes, O'er which you drop those snowy veils, their lids, To hide what they would tellâyet, thus, betray; And your whole form shrinking with consciousness, Which breathes such fears as fan the lover's hopes. Dear Lady Anneâ Lady A. Sir Philip, here I am. And judge me as a man of honour would The maid he truly loves, and not in vain! Thereâyou have ta'en possession! Loose me now, And meet me presently at Lady Blanche's, Whither by friendship am I summon'd straight! And should obey, since love's behest is done. [They go out severally. SCENE THE LAST. âA Room in Lady Blanche's. Enter John. John. The knot is tied!âI am a married man, And now I wish myself a single one! Great people do not sort with me, their ways Are so uncommon! 'Tis a serious thing To marry! There, throughout the ceremony, Sir Philip stood, with handkerchief to mouth, Stifling his laughter; opposite, his friends, Lords John and Stephen, lords although they be, Tittering outright, and nudging one another. Be this the mode with men of quality, I know, in those beneath them, it would pass For monstrously bad breeding! But the worst Is yet to come!âThe bride herself must laughâ Laugh till her sides shook.âYea, and I, prepared With a most lovely kerchief for the tears I thought she would be drown'd in.â'Pon my life, Great folks are no great thingsâbut I am married! Rob. [Entering, handkerchief to mouth.] What! Col. Blount alone!âWhy, where's your bride? Gone to recruit her spirits, I suppose, After the ceremony! 'Twas a most Affecting one! John. You found it so. Rob. I did. How near akin are moods most opposite! I vow there's not a pin's point difference 'Twixt tears and laughter.âNay, 'tis known to all Grief laughs as oft as weeps. John. You mean it falls Into hysterics. Rob. As I nearly did To-day. John. No! Rob. Yes, as I'm a baronet! Upon my life!âO, Colonel Blount, how well You play'd the bridegroom!âso impressively. I have seen moving things, but ne'er was moved Before to-day! 'Twas well the clergyman Was hackney'd in the ceremony, else He never had got through with it! John. Say you so? This is another version of the story! And did I play the bridegroom movingly? Rob. The bride, methinks, might satisfy you there. I am sure I saw her tremble. John. Tremble?âShake! Rob. Indeed? 'Twas well she did not quite go off. John. I thought 'twas all with mirth. Rob. Mirth, Colonel Blount! I wish you could have seen and heard yourself! You look'd and spoke! John. How did I speak and look? Pathetically? Rob. Spare me, gentle sir, I lack your constancy! John. My constancy! It is my forte!âIf there is one thing, sir, Wherein, among the things that I excel in, I quite surpass myself, I may aver It is my constancy. I see it now! I have a way of speaking serious things, And doing them, quite of my own!âThe bride! Enter Charlotte, supported by Jacob and Stephen. Permit me, noble friends, how does my wife? Char. A little better! John. Cruel that I was! The ceremony was too much for you! And 'twas my fault! If I had dream'd of it, I should have skipp'd my share, or rhymed it o'er. Char. I ne'er heard sermon so affected me, And I have heard all kindsâcharity ones, And funeral onesâI may have wept at some, But never was o'erpower'd until to-day! John. Nay, think of it no more. Char. Each syllable Spoke volumes to me. John. You distress me, love! Char. I must give vent to what I feel, or drop! John. Nay then, dear love, speak on. Char. You certainly Were destined for the church. John. O no! Char. You were! John. Upon my honour, love, I tell thee no! Char. The gown and surplice little know their loss! But stop! said I the church?âI meant the stage, For there they have the art superlative Of moving hearts, beleaguering them so, Perforce they yield, and to the captors pay Tribute incontinent of sighs and tears! John. Almost I guess the stage had been my forte! Char. What a tragedian, husband, had you made! John. I think I had! Char. Were it a killing part, No need of dagger, poison'd chalice, cord! Your looks had slain without them. John. I believe The stage has lost a murderer in me! I won't regret it, though; come, lady wife, We now must feast, so let me lead thee home! Peter. [Entering.] One Master Blount inquires for you below, A dame along with him who seems his wife. John. [Aside.] My father and my mother!âBid them hie At noon to-morrow to the place they know On Ludgate-hill.âI cannot see them here. [Peter goes out. Char. Who wants to see you, husband? John. Nobody. A friend of such a sort as one may have And know notâone may lose and never miss. Peter. [Re-entering.] He is angry at your answerâthere he stands, And will not quit the door. John. Most shocking breeding! Repeat my answer, sir, I cannot see him, [Colonel Blount bursting in, followed by Master and Mistress Blount: Sir Philip Brilliant and Lady Anne, who joins Lady Blanche, entering from another part of the chamber. Col. Blount. Where is my brother?âmay I call him so, Who keeps his reverend parents at the door! What means this, Johnâhow comes it? What! Art thou My elder brother, and instruct'st me thus? Endurest thou the roof, that is too proud To shelter these most loved and sacred heads? Spurn'st not the threshold, that admits thy feet, And these most hallow'd ones forbids to pass? Hold'st commerce with the host, that takes thee in, And those thou ow'st thy being to shuts out? For surely host, roof, threshold, are to blame; For sacrilege 'gainst nature like to this, And not the man with whom I share one blood. John. There are times, brother, and occasions. Col. Blount. None For doing that which damns the precious soul; And Heaven hath set our parents next itself For piety, whose slight entaileth death! Passing along with these most noble friends, I saw our sire and mother at the door; Paid them my duty; found they had traced thee hither, Succeeding on the search that baffled me; Learn'd the proud message thou hadst sent them down; And gave't reception, as became their son! Up to them, brother! no excuses make For what admits of none; but own thy fault, And ask for pardon. Mis. Blount. Husband, tell me now, Is not a mother far the likeliest To know her own son? Where is now thy John? But look upon my Thomas! Gentleman Or tradesman, he is the same!âwould own thee, though Thou still hadst apron on!âwould smile at me, Call'd I him now âGood Thomas!âHonest lad!â Kind boy!â as, when he was thy 'prentice, John I used to do; and he was fond to hear, And now, I will be bound, would like as well! Col. Blount. O mother, there are strains in boyhood heard, As men that thrill us, as none other can! But come, forgive my brother. Lady A. [Coming forward.] Blanche, a thought Has struck me. Show thyself. Let him behold The yeoman's maid again.âHe is riveted! Col. Blount. She is found. Lady A. [Aside.] My guess was right! Col. Blount. It must be she! The simple silent maid, in humble guise, Whose beauty unpretending, without aid, Made captive of me!âwhom, although I left, I follow'd stillâfrom whom that gap, they say Oblivion oft fills upâfatal to loveâ Absenceâcould ne'er divide me, but became A bed in which the stream of memory ran, And gather'd flood in flowing.âArt not she? O turn to me!âO let me see thy face, The radiant impress of consummate woman, Superlative from Nature's hand alone, Who, jealous of her master-work, refused Prosperity and rank a share in thee, And made thee daughter, rare, of lowliness! Will you not turn? Lady Bl. Yes, will you guarantee All risk, thereby, I run. Col. Blount. I do! Lady Bl. Behold! Col. Blount. The yeoman's maid! were empress of the earth, Did rank by beauty go! Lady Bl. Know'st thou me not? Col. Blount. Know I thee not? Ay, by these eyes that see thee, These ears that hear thee; and, beyond e'en these, The heart that feasts on what they see and hear. Lady Bl. Thou know'st me not? Col. Blount. Art not the yeoman's maid? Lady Bl. I am, but was not she.âShe was a sprite, My wayward fancy for illusion raised, Now marvellously turn'd to flesh and blood, Through talisman of thy most noble worth! None see you here beside the yeoman's maid? Col. Blount. None. Lady Bl. Let me doff the hood I still kept on. How say you now, sir? Col. Blount. Nothing do I see, Except the yeoman's maid. I see the hood Still in your modest coif and simple cloak. Lady Bl. There then. Col. Blount. The Countess. Lady Bl. No.âThe yeoman's maid. Spare what I was for what I have become; If what I have become content thee, take me! Or take me not, none other e'er shall own me! Now do I see how wealth and rank themselves, Estranging Nature from simplicity, May root her graces up, and in their stead Plant blemishes;âbut I have wider swerved, Misled by vanity and pride of sway, Never suspecting that to hold one heart, Outwent the boast of winning thousand onesâ A lesson taught by you, and learn'd for life! Col. Blount. How will the mood the selfsame features change! E'en as the air will change the selfsame cheek! Now, I behold again the maid I loved, Still loveâhad loved, for ever, though unfound. Take thee? I do!âIn all humility, And thankfulness and love, I take thee, lady! Charlotte. [Advancing with her party.] My mistress. [To Robert. Rob. Yes; and there's my master! Come! Let's steal away. Come! Stephen! Jacob! Steph. and Jacob. Well? Rob. To keep our titles, best we take them hence! John. Nay, noble friends, tarry awhile, I pray. My father, mother, and my brother, there, And those good friends, I question not, will join My feast in honour of our nuptials with The Countess Lady Blanche. Char. [Running up to John, and placing her hand before his mouth.] Stop, Colonel Blount. Col. Blount. I answer to that name. Char. No, sir! I mean This gentleman. Col. Blount. Brother! How were you made A colonel? John. How was I made a colonel?âby Rapid promotion. Sir Phil. Robert, this is you! Rob. I own 'twas I that dubb'd him colonel, sir, But with his own good-will. John. Wife, how is this? Char. Dear husband, pardon me, I am not the Countess, but her lady's-maid. John. I'll be divorced. Char. You must be married first. You have been cheated, sir, but innocently, At cost alone of your credulity. Our wedding and our titles, were the same,â A play to make you wise and pass the hour! Col. Blount. John, take it in good part. John. I will do so, Brother, I am a man to bear a jest. If there is one thing I am master in Beyond another, brother, it is that. Lady Bl. Anne! Lady A. Blanche? [Coming down. Lady Bl. A man is something after all! Lady A. Yes, with our helpâI made one of Sir Philip. Lady Bl. Nay, Anne, my eyes are open'd. We require Men's help as wellâexcept for Colonel Blount I ne'er had been a woman. Much I question If you, yourself, are past improving by them. Lady A. O Blanche! Lady Bl. O Anne! the older, still the wiser! And won't I titter when you say âobeyâ Before the parson! Will you say it? Lady A. Yes. Lady Bl. And âloveâ and âhonourâ too? Lady A. I will!âWon't you? Lady Bl. Devoutly, Anne, as e'er I said my prayers. But, Anne, the pass we're come to! Don't you know? How shall we answer to old maids for this? Lady A. Lay heads together, and concoct a speech. Proceed you. Lady Bl. Nay, I never open'd school, On which account take you precedence, Anne. I'll help you to the first wordââLadies!ââwell? Lady A. LadiesâI'll lay the fault upon the men. [To Blanche. Lady Bl. [Aside.] They lay the fault first who are most to blame. Lady A. But for the men we had been still old maids. Accept of our regrets. Lady Bl. Nay, Anne, tell truthâ We don't regret at all! Let me go on, I'll make a grace of our defection, Anne.â Ladies, applaud us martyrs in the cause, For which, contending with more zeal than heed, We were ta'en captive by the common foe. Profit by our example, don't despise An enemy, though slight; and, if you fail As we have done, endure it with good grace; Believe you put on wreaths, in wedlock's chains, And turn, with loving faith, to flowers the links, Of which the strongest beggars liberty. END OF OLD MAIDS.</field>
