      <field name="fulltext">THE LEGEND OF STAUFFENBERG; A Dramatic Cantata,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part First. Scene I. âThe woods of Stauffenberg. Night. Wood Spirits rising.âAmong them Ianthe. No. 1.âORCHESTRAL PRELUDE. No. 2.âCHORUS OF WOOD SPIRITS. Garish day hath closed his eye, Mortals tired to rest are laid. And the chaste moon, mounted high, Bids us forth o'er lawn and glade; When day drowses, then wake we, Haunters of the woodland sweet, On deeds of gentle ministry Winging our airy circles fleet. Hither and thither! Now here, now there! Whither, O whither On earth or in air, Do we not wander, do we not wander? We charm the drops in our dells that shine From the foamy beard of old Father Rhine, While he lies dreaming yonder. Virgins we of Cynthia's train, From the swart sun hiding shy, Never day-beam dared profane The cold caverns where we lie; But by night when small flowers wake, All for thirst nigh-withering, Moon-blest dews from cloud and lake In our vestal hands we bring. Hither and thither! Now here, now there! Whither, O whither On earth or in air, Do we not wander, do we not wander? We charm the drops in our dells that shine From the foamy beard of old Father Rhine, While he lies dreaming yonder. (They disperse leaving Ianthe alone.) No. 3.âIanthe (Recit.) Alone at last! Deep coverts of green leaves, Lit by cold glimpses of the visiting moon, With wistful heart and pain of unshed tears, Ianthe leaves you. O in the woods to-night, And many a night, my pale day-wearied flowers Shall look for me in vain, the loving tongues Of happy flitting sprites call me in vain! Sisters, farewell! Still do your innocent rites And sylvan charities. Forget her name,â Ianthe's nameâwho thus forgets her vow. The sun has looked on me, and all my breast Aches with strange fire. This throbbing human heart Love gives me. Lord of Stauffenberg, I come To make in thy bright world my untried home. ARIA. Fall off, my wings! Insphere me, dull-paced flesh! Lo, on the verge I stand Of the mysterious change that clothes me fresh For that new wonderland! Farewell, my dances in moonlighted dells, Farewell, my trees, my flowers, my vestal vow, With what high-billowing hopes my bosom swells; I am a Woman now! O heart, why now so fiercely glad, When, heart, I fain would weep, Or grow divinely sad, Sighing thee to soft sleep. O heart, O new-born heart, Tell me, fond heart, what sets thee beating, What elvish, fluttering thing thou art, That will not rest for no entreating? No. 4.âTHE COMING OF DAWN. (Instrumental Symphony.) No. 5.âIanthe (Recit.) O bliss to meet the pure face of the dawn That once I fled in fearâin sunbright dew To bathe my woman's feet! O deeper bliss To hide my blood-warmed cheek 'mid fragrant leaves Counting the tremulous moments, till the horn Cries to my heart: âConrad comes hunting here!â (Horns heard in the distance.) No. 6.âHUNTSMAN'S CHORUS. The lark was up an hour ago, The dew begins to dry, Then Huntsman, ho! thy bugle blow, The hounds are in full cry. Tra, la, la! Tra, la, la! The hounds are in full cry. No timid deer we come to scare, In the pleasant woods to-day, But we rouse the bear in his gloomy lair, And bring the boar to bay. Tra, la, la! We bring the boar to bay. O merrily shines the sun this morn, In the green heart of the wood, But rest we scorn, till we wind the horn, Where he shines on the boar's heart-blood. Tra, la, la! Where he shines on the boar's heart-blood. No. 7.âConrad (entering) Recit. A noble burst! and yet I care not for it. I'll hunt no more to-day. This is the spot Where that mysterious impulse of deep joy Set my heart aching. Ha! what have we here? A spirit or a woman? A woman sure, Weeping, and lovelier than my woodland dream! I'll speak to her. No. 8.âDuo.âConrad (and Ianthe). O nymph of dawn, fair vision of delight, That with wild sighs hast set my bosom swelling, What art thou? Whence, in this heart-piercing plight, Comest thou to these rough woods for nightly dwelling? O pardon, sweet, that on thy solitude Thus rudely I have burst, who merely pray, With heart by thy deep beauty all subdued, To serve thee, love thee, kiss those tears away. Ianthe. O gentle knight, for gentle and a knight I do believe thee, grant but one sweet favour, To her who comes in this unhappy plight, To thee alone, to serve her and to save her. O let me trust the music of thy tongue, That most persuades when most it seems to pray! Swear by the heart of constancy, still young, To serve me, love me, kiss my tears away. Both. O truth alone makes music on the/thy tongue That can persuade when it would seem to pray! I/Yet swear by constancy's own heart, still young, To serve thee/me, love thee/me, kiss thy/my tears away. Conrad. I swear, I swear, by yonder quenchless star! Ianthe. O will thy love pass with the setting sun? Conrad. Death, who mars all, alone its day shall mar. Ianthe. O welcome night when that fair day is done! Conrad. Thus let me seal the compact on thy lips. Ianthe. Thus ever shine love's day without eclipse! No. 9.âCHORUS OF ELEMENTAL SPIRITS. 1. From earth and from air, From the floods overhead, From the floods underground, From the caverns of fire, Ianthe! Ianthe! We bid thee beware! By the tears thou hast shed, By the fears thou hast found, By the storms of desire That circle thee round, And whirl thee and shake thee And never forsake thee, We bid thee beware! Ianthe! Ianthe! Lest anguish o'ertake thee. 2. Ianthe! Ianthe! we call thee, we call thee, In pity we call thee, lest ruin befall thee. Trust rather the bear, The wolf in his lair, The fox in his den, Than the tongues of false men! Ianthe! Ianthe! No. 10.âRECIT. AND DUO, WITH CHORUS. Ianthe. Peace! ye ill-boding spirits, give me peace! Let these wild clamours cease! [Ianthe] (To Conrad). Ah! thou hast much to hearâI dread, I dread! Conrad. For lovers' sins love's shrift is quickly said! Ianthe. O thou art true! Thou thinkest me a woman? Conrad. A nymph, a fay, O something more than human! Ianthe. Hark! let me whisper in thine ear. Chorus of Elemental Spirits. Ianthe! Ianthe! Ai! Ai! Ianthe. I am no ghost, I am no dream, Yet not solely what I seem; A perfect woman part by part, With a woman's form and a woman's heart. My eyes can weep, my cheek can glow, Pierce my breast and the blood will flow: I was but one of the loving sprites That tend the innocent flowers o' nights; I grew, through trance of long agony, A warm sweet woman for love of thee. I love thee, I love thee, come weal or woe, No pale Eve's daughter can love thee so. Give me thy love or let me die This moment everlastingly! Conrad. Be thou demon, or be thou sprite, Thy wild eyes lighten with pure love-light. I love thee, I love thee, come weal or woe, No pale Eve's daughter could love me so. Both. I love thee, I love thee, come weal or woe, No pale Eve's daughter could love me/thee so. Give me thy love, or let me die This moment everlastingly! Chorus of Elemental Spirits. Ianthe! Ianthe! Ai! Ai! No. 11.âDUO AND CHORUS. Ianthe. O joy ineffable! O pain long past! Deep in thy heart to dwell, Thine, thine at last! Both (AND CHORUS) Be true! be true! Conrad. O joy ineffable! O pain long past! Deep in my heart to dwell, Mine, mine at last! Both. Then love be true! Be true! be true! Chorus of Elemental Sprits. Be true! be true! Scene II. âRoom in the Castle of Stauffenberg. Conrad and Ianthe. Chorus of Soldiers in outer Court. No. 12.âDUO AND CHORUS. Ianthe. Thou wilt not go! Thou wilt not leave me here, A captive sad in these forsaken halls! Conrad. Ah! temptress, grown each day tenfold more dear, Tempt not with such sweet wiles when honour calls! Ianthe. Shall love risk death for honour's empty name? Conrad. What love can live couched in bright honour's grave? Ianthe. Love, jealous, flies from hearts that worship fame. Conrad. Wouldst chain me here, thy beauty's sloth-pined slave? Both. O woful hour! O bitter feast of pain! Winter of love that rends us heart from heart! Ianthe. Cruel to go! Conrad. Dishonour to remain! Both. Twenty sharp deaths die lovers when they part! CHORUS OF SOLDIERS (without). From the south to the north, Thro' the cornland and vineland, The call is gone forth To the sons of the Rhineland. Arm! arm! for their health Whom your hearts clasp the nearest, For your homes' fairest wealth, For the fields ye hold dearest; Fierce foes are at handâ Out, then, good swords, and tell them Our dear Fatherland Lacks not power to repel them. Fatherland! Fatherland! Conrad. Hark! how my soldiers shout! and I their chief Stand dallying here. Unwind those blissful arms That make me traitor. Fatherland, I come! Ianthe. One moment stay! O weakness, O despair Of fainting love that dreads some unknown wrong! CHORUS (without). Like boars mad with want, They would trample our tillage, Like wolves famine-gaunt, They are hungry for pillage. Do they come for our Rhine? They shall drink its cold water. Our fields? 'Neath each vine They shall rest from the slaughter. Thy foes in fierce band Rush to ravage and rend thee, Fatherland! Fatherland! We are here to defend thee. Fatherland! Fatherland! Conrad. Ten thousand thousand fond farewells! Ianthe. Ten thousand thousand fond farewells! Both. Adieu then, love, adieu, Be ever, ever true; Love soar on wings of flame, To holier heights of fame! Adieu! Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part Second. Scene I. âFranconia. A Chamber in the Palace. Conrad. Chorus in the outer Court. A Triumphal March. No. 13.âCHORUS. Hail! hail! hail! To the mighty conqueror! Hail! hail! hail! To the brave who rest from war. Be each dinted helm unbound, Every brow with laurel crowned. Strip from tired limbs the bloody mail, In silken ease and rest regale! All hail! all hail! Hail! hail! hail! Worthiest Stauffenberg to thee! Leap all hearts to bid him hail, Our champion red with victory! Welcome, Prince, our power and pride, Welcome to thy royal bride! Joy! the fairest in the land Crowns thy worth with loving hand. All hail! all hail! Stauffenberg! Stauffenberg! Long live Prince Conrad! [AN INTERVAL.] Scene I.âcontinued. No. 14.âConrad (Recit.) Come, greatness, come! my dream of love, farewell! Ianthe! O Ianthe! I tear the dearest nerve quick from my heart, Tearing myself from thee. A fateful trumpet calls me. O farewell! Chorus of Elemental Spirits. Ianthe! Ianthe! Ai! Ai! No. 14 A.âConrad (Aria). Welcome, Titan-eyed ambition! In Love's bower may dream the boy. I accept the stern condition That bereaves my heart of joyâ Dare to clasp thee, bride immortal, Dare to claim thy dreadful dower, Dare to pass the Olympian portal, Grasp the thunderbolts of power. Shall vain ease, that siren-charmer, Fool me with bold deeds half done, Bid me doff, content, my armour, With the world's great war half-won? Noâlet falcons, tame of pinion, Meanly stoop at lady's lure, In his own august dominion The grave eagle reigns secure. Scene II. âRoom in Stauffenberg Castle. Ianthe alone. No. 15.âSolo.âIanthe. Woe, woe, woe, woe, nothing but lonely woe! Let me alone, to make my moan to the crannying Winds that blow Dolefully high and low, As homeless they come and go! O winds, we are one in woeâ Sing with me then heigho! Heigho! heigho! My sighs are turned to snatches of sad song To hush a weary heart. Well, death ends all. No more be woman! Up, rage, ye wild winds, Lend all your turbulent might to champion me! Ye swift and seraph-visaged lightnings, be My winged and all-confounding ministers! Make ye my bower my tomb, gulf this grey hold A blazing ruin, deep in the cold Rhineâ And thenâ My hour draws on! Beauteous body, fare thee well! Agony must break the spell That agony alone could weave. Lovingly I take my leave; But unreluctant, undismayed, I feel thee droop, I see thee fade, Fare thee well! dear mortal homeâ Conrad, I come, I come, I come! Scene III. âBridal Procession. King, Princess Bertha, Conrad. Bridal Chorus. Afterwards Ianthe with Chorus of Elemental Spirits. No. 16.âCHORUS. Honour, empire, nuptial blessing, Love's coy graces sweet and rare, Marriage blisses past expressing, Richly dower this peerless pair! Men. Joy to the realm that hopes so fair a queen! Women. Joy to the realm whose prince hath such a mien! Men. Joy to the realm whose homes have such a head! Women. Joy to the realm whose armies are so led! CHORUS. Honour, empire, marriage blessing, Heavenly favours past expressing, All things good and all things fair, Richly dower this royal pair! Conrad (aside). How this rude popular merriment, These bells that nuptial welcome peal, Insult a heart whose discontent Weak smiling lips but ill conceal! Bertha (aside). What weight of secret discontent Sits on my love's half-frowning brow? Even 'midst this bridal merriment What bodement chills my spirit now? Trio.âBertha, Conrad, The King. Thanks, friends, for all the festal splendour, Your zeal to this fair day imparts; Firm stands the realm while thus ye tender The joyous homage of your hearts. CHORUS.

Joy to the realm whose prince hath such a mien! Men. Joy to the realm whose homes have such a head! Women. Joy to the realm whose armies are so led! No. 17.âCHORUS. Thro' the leaves runs a boding sigh, The birds that but now were singing are hid, And a lurid cloud looms low thro' the air In menacing silenceâwhat may it mean? No. 18.âCHORUS OF ELEMENTAL SPIRITS (dispersedly). (Spirits of Lightning.) From the caves of air, From the lightning's lair, We are come, we are come, To trouble this bridal. (Spirits of Thunder.) From the womb of each cloud, Leaping, shouting loud, We are come, we are come, To trouble this bridal. (Spirits of Hail.) From the cloudlands of frost, Ever tempest-tost, We are come, we are come, To trouble this bridal. (Spirits of Tempest.) From the zones of the earth, Where fierce winds have birth, We are come, we are come, To trouble this bridal. (All together.) From fire, sea, earth, air, From everywhere, We are come, we are come, To trouble this bridal. No. 19.âIanthe (Recit.) Conrad, Conrad, from the arms of thy bride, I call thee and claim thee! Conrad (Recit.) What cry was that? From the clouds what cried? My lips dare not name thee! Bertha. My lord, my lord, do the sprites that flame In the storm enchant thee? Conrad. What cry was that? Who called my name? Bertha. Thy name! Conrad. Ianthe! Ianthe! No. 20.âIanthe (and Conrad) Duo. Conrad, Conrad, I am here, I am here, By thy side, at thine ear, My love, I have found thee, My arms are around thee, With kisses I shame thee, My own I proclaim thee, My kisses shall dart A sweet pang to thy heart,â O come,âI have sighed for thee, Lived for thee, died for thee, O come! Conrad. My love, my love, art thou here, art thou here, Pressing, so near? Once more hast thou found me, Thy arms are around me, Thy kisses that shame me, A traitor proclaim me, Thy lips bid depart A vain dream from my heart, O take me, I sigh for thee, Love thee, will die for thee. I come! Bertha. My love, my lord! Alas! his looks are wild! King. What horror's this? Alas! my ill-starred child! Ianthe. My love, my lord! I claim thee undefiled! Conrad. Burst, my worn heart, with transport all too wild! King., Bertha. O day of grief! O woful, woful day Of joy so deep, so rudely rent away! Conrad., Ianthe. O day of love! O blissful, blissful day Of wrong removed, of sorrow past away! Bridal Chorus. O day of grief! O woful, woful day Of joy so deep, so rudely rent away! Chorus of Elemental Spirits. O day of love!

Stay, Conrad, stay, what power of evil charms? No. 22.âCHORUS. O horror! O fear! with the might of a troop He hath torn himself from us, And spurs like a tempest the tempest to meet, Where the thunders are direst! O madness! O prince of all hearts, rush not so to thy doom! Naught stays him. He stretches his hand to the lightning and leaps In the midst of their earth-shaking firesâalas! he is goneâ Hurled down by the torrent or hurried aloft by the rage Of the whirlwind that snatches the oaks from their station of pride. He is goneâand our glory goes with him! Great spirit, farewell! No. 23.âBertha. Recit.âGone with no word of love! (Aria Parlante). More woful bridal never woman knew. Come away! And ere I die on this cold bosom strew These withered flowers with slips of mournful yew, So keep love's day! Come, for my heart lies dead, This breast its bier, Sleep seal these eyes that shed Never a tear; Lone in some cloistered shade, Making no moan, Bride, widow, lovelorn maid, Leave me alone. There, Death for bridal guest Crowned with love's flowers, Leave me to take my rest, Ebb with the hours; There to lie still and pray For a strayed soul, Till death, with dying day, Ease me from dole. SYMPHONIC INTERMEZZO. Scene IV. No. 24.â(Duo)âIanthe., Conrad. Ever to love, Never to part, None to reprove, When heart pants to heart! O in love's purest wells Lave me and steep me, In thy soul's inmost cells, Hide me and keep me! Thus star weds star In a boundless union, Naught to mar Their intense communion. O the bliss to wheel On wild wings pulsating, As Love's life we feel Throbbing, palpitating. No. 25.âCHORUS OF ELEMENTAL SPIRITS. As the stars' restless fires, So are the heart's desires, And Love must have his will, His wings will ne'er be still. Soars eagle pride so high Thro' the lone upper sky? Love can soar higher still, And bend him to his will. What mortal wars with Love? We airy powers above Will fight against him still, And bend him to Love's will. As the stars' restless fires, So are the heart's desires, Love's wings are never still, And Love must have his will. No. 26.âConrad., Ianthe (Duo). Where are the piercing eyes Can read life's mysteries? Where are the ears can read Where its wild discords lead? Ianthe. Pride and ambition dwell In the deep bounds of Hell. Conrad. But conquering Love soars high, Thro' the wide upper sky. No. 27.âCHORUS OF ELEMENTAL SPIRITS. Who knows what he has done, What victories he has won? Who knows what Love hath cost, What life has won and lost? No. 28.âIanthe., Conrad (Duo and Chorus). Count not love's loss and gain, Weigh not life's bliss or pain; The fight is still begun, The victory never won. No. 29.âCHORUS. Who knows what he has done, What victories he has won? Who knows what Love hath cost, What life has won and lost? Count not love's loss and gain, Weigh not life's bliss or pain; The fight is still begun, The victory never won.</field>
