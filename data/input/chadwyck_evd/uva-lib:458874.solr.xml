      <field name="fulltext">The Scene Epire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. Scen. I. Enter Simonides, and two Lawyers. Sim. Is the Law firm Sir? 1. Law. The Law, what more firm Sir, More powerfull, forcible, or more permanent? Sim. By my troth Sir, I partly doe beleeve it; conceive Sir You have indirectly answered my question. I did not doubt the fundamentall grounds Of Law in generall, for the most solid, But this particular Law that me concerns Now at the present, if that be firm and strong, And powerfull, and forcible, and permanent. I am a yong man that has an old father. 2 Law. Nothing more strong Sir, It is Secundum statutum Principu Confirmatum cum voce senatum, Et voce republicæ, nay consummatum Et exemplificatum, is it not in force When divers have already tasted it And payd their lives for penalty? Sim. Tis true, My father must be next, this day compleats Full fourscore years upon him. 2. Law. Hees heer then Sub pœna statuti, hence I can tell him Truer then all the Physitians in the world, He cannot live out to morrow; this is The most certain Climactericall year, Tis past all danger, for ther's no scaping it: What age is your mother Sir? Sim. Faith neer her dayes to, Wants some two of threescore. 1. Law. So, sheel drop away One of these dayes to; heers a good age now For those that have old parents, and rich inheritance. Sim. And Sir tis profitable for others too: Are there not fellows that lie bed-rid in their offices That yonger men would walk lustily in: Churchmen, that even the second infancy Hath silenc'd, yet hath spun out their lives so long That many pregnant and ingenious spirits Have languishd in their hop'd reversions, And died upon the thought, and by your leave Sir, Have you not places fild up in the Law By some grave Senators, that you imagin Have held them long enough, and such spirits as you, Were they remov'd, would leap into their dignities? 1. Law. Dic qui bus in terris &amp; eris mihi magnus Apollo. Sim. But tell me faith your fair opinion: Ist not a sound and necessary Law This (by the Duke) enacted? 1. Law. Never did Greece (Our ancient star of brave Philosophers) Mongst all her Nomothera and Lawgivers, Not when she flourished in her seven fold sages, (Whose living memory can never die) Produce a Law more grave and necessary. Sim. I'me of that mind to. 2. Law I will maintain Sir, Draco's Oligarchy, that the gouernment Of Community reduced into few Fram'd a fair state; Solons Crecopedi That cut off poor mens debts to their rich creditors Was good and charitable (but not full allowd.) His Sisaithie did reform that error, His honourable Senate of Areopagitæ, Liturgus was more loose, and gave too free And licentious reyns unto his discipline, As that a yong woman in her husbands weaknes Might choose her able friend to propogate; That so the Commonwealth might be supplide, With hope of lusty spirits, Plato did erre, And so did Aristotle, allowing Lewd and luxurious limits to their Lawes; But now our Epire, our Epires Evander, Our noble and wise Prince has hit the Law That all our predecessive students Have mist unto their shame. Enter Cleanthes. Sim. Forbear the praise Sir. Tis in it selfe most pleasing, Cleanthes Oh lad heers a spring for yong plants to flourish, The old trees must down kept the sun from us, We shall rise now boy. Clean. Whether Sir I pray? To the bleak air of storms, among those trees, Which we had shelter from. Sim. Yes from our growth, Our sap and livelyhood and from our fruit, What tis not Jubilee with thee yet, I think, Thou lookst so sad ont, how old's thy father? Clean. Jubilee, no indeed, tis a bad year with me. Sim. Prithee how old's thy father, then I can tell thee? Clean. I know not how to answer you Simonides, Hees is too old being now expos'd Unto the rigor of a cruell Edict, And yet not old enough by many years, Cause I'de not see him goe an howr before me. Sim. These very passions I speak to my father, Come, come, heers none but friends heer, we may speak Our insides freely, these are Lawyers man, And shalbe Counsellors shortly. Cle. They shalbe now Sir, And shall have large fees if thei'le undertake To help a good cause (for it wants assistance) Bad ones (I know) they can insist upon. 1. Law. Oh Sir, we must undertake of both parts, But the good we have most good in. Cle. Pray you say, How doe you allow of this strange Edict? 1. Law. Secundum Justitiam, by my faith Sir, The happiest Edict that ever was in Epire. Cle. What, to kill innocents Sir, it cannot be, It is no rule in justice there to punish. 1. Law. Oh Sir, You understand a conscience, but not law. Cle. Why sir, is there so main a difference? 1. Law. You'l never be good Lawyer if you understand not that. Cle. I think then tis the best to be a bad one. 1. Law. Why sir, the very letter and the sense both Doe both orethrow you in this statute, Which that speaks, that every man living to Fourscore years, and women to threescore, shall then Be cut off as fruitless to the Republike, And Law shall finish what nature lingerd at. Cle. And this suit shall soon be dispatcht in Law. 1. Law. It is so plain it can have no Demur, The Church Booke overthrows it. Cle. And so it does The Church Book overthrowes it if you read it well. 1. Law. Still you runne from the Law into error: You say it takes the lives of Innocents, I say no, and so sayes common reason: What man lives to fourescore and women to three That can die innocent? Cle. A fine lawfull evasion: Good sir rehearse the full statute to me. Sim. Fie thats too tedious, you have already The full sum in the breef relation. Cle. Sir, mongst many words may be found contradictions, And these men dare sue and wrangle with a Statute, If they can pick a quarrell with some error: 2. Law. Listen sir, ile gather it as breefe as I can for you, Anno Primo Evandri, bee it (for the care and good of the Common wealth for divers necessary reasons that wee shall urge) thus peremptorily enacted, Cle. A faire pretence if the reasons foule it not. 2. Law. That all men living in our Dominions of Epire in their decayd nature, to the age of foure score, or women to the age of three score, shall on the same day bee instantly put to death, by those meanes and instruments that a former Proclamation had (to this purpose) through our said territories dispersed. Cle. There was no women in this Senate certain. 1. Law. That these men being past their bearing Armes, to aide and defend their Countrey, past their manhood and livelihood, to propogate any further issue to their posterity, and as well past their councells (which overgrown gravity is now run into dotage) to assist their Countrey, to whom in common reason, nothing should be so wearisome as their owne lives, as it may be supposed is tedious to their successive heires, whose times are spent in the good of their Countrey, yet wanting the meanes to maintaine it; and are like to grow old before their inheritance (borne to them) come to their necessary use, for the which are the women, for that they never were defence to their Countrey, never by Counsell admitted to the assist of government of their Countrey, onely necessary to the propagation of posterity, and now at the age of threescore to be past that good, and all their goodnesse: it is thought fit then a quarter abated from the more worthy member to be put to death as is before recited: provided that for the just and impartiall execution of this our Statute the example shall first begin in and about our Court, which our selfe will see carefully performed, and not for a full Month following extend any further into our Dominions: Dated the sixt of the second month at our Pallace Royall in Epire. Cle. A fine edict, and very fairely guilded And is there no scruple in all these words, To demurr the Law upon occasion? Sim. Pox tis an unnecessary inquisition, Prithee set him not about it. 2. Law. Troth none sir, It is so evident and plain a case There is no succor for the Defendant. Cle. Possible, can nothing help in a good case? 1. Law. Faith sir I doe think there may be a hole Which would protract delay if not remedie. Cle. Why theres some comfort in that good sir? speake it, 1. Law. Nay you must pardon me for that sir. Sim. Prithee doe not, It may ope a wound to many Sonns and Heires That may die after it. Cle. Come sir, I know how to make you speake, will this doot? 1. Law. I will afford you my opinion sir. Cle. Pray you repeat the literall words expresly The time of Death. Sim. Tis an unnecessary question, prithee let it alone. 2. Law. Heare his opinion, twill be fruitlesse sir. That man at the age of four score, and women at threescore Shall the same day be put to death. 1. Law. Thus I helpe the man to twenty one yeares more, Cle. That were a faire addition. 1. Law. Mark it, sir wee say man is not at age Till he be one and twenty before his infancy And adolescensie, nor by that addition, Fourscore he cannot be till a hundred and one. Sim. Oh poore evasion! Hees fourescore yeares old sir, 1. Law. That helps more sir He begins to be old at fifty, so at fourscore, Hees but thirty yeares old, so believe it sir, He may be twenty yeares in declination And so long may a man linger and live bit Sim. The worst hope of safety that ere I heard, Give him his fee againe, tis not worth two deneers. 1. Law. Theres no Law for restitution of fees sir. Enter Creon &amp; Antigona. Cle. No no sir, I meant it lost when twas given. Sim. No more good sir Heere are eares unnecessary for your doctrine. 1. Law. I have spoke out my fee and I have done sir. Sim. Oh my deare father! Creon. Tush meet me not in exclaimes I understand the worst and hope no better: A fine Law, if this hold, white heads will be cheape And many watchmens places will be vacant Forty of em I know my seniors, That did due deeds of darknesse to their Countrey, Has watchd em a good turne fort, and tane em Napping now, the fewer Hospitalls will serve to, Many may be usd for stewes and brothells And those people will never trouble em to fourescore. Anti. Can you play and sport with sorrow sir? Creon. Sorrow, for what Antigona? for my life, My sorrowes I have kept it so long well With bringing it up unto so ill an end: I might have gently lost it in my Cradle, Before my Nerves and Ligaments grew strong To binde it faster to me. Sim. For mine owne sake I should have beene sorry for that. Creon. In my youth I was a Souldier, no Coward in my age, I never turnd my back upon my foe, I have felt natures winters sicknesses, Yet ever kept a lively sap in me To greet the cheerefull spring of health agen: Dangers on Horseback, on Foot, by Water, I have scapd to this day, and yet this day Without all help of casuall accidents Is onely deadly to me, cause it numbers Fourscore yeares to me, wheres the fault now? I cannot blame Time, Nature, nor my Stars Nor ought but Tyranny, even Kings themselves Have some times tasted an even fate with me, He that has beene a Souldier all his dayes And stood in personall opposition, gainst Darts and Arrowes, the Extreames of heat, And pinching cold, has treacherously at home In his secured quiet by a villaines hand Am basely lost in my starrs ignorance And so must I die by a Tyrants sword. 1. Law. Oh say, not so sir, it is by the Law! Cre. And whats that sir but the sword of Tyranny When it is brandish'd against innocent lives? I'me now upon my death bed sir, and tis fit I should unbosome my free conscience And shew the faith I die in, I doe beleeve Tis tyranny that takes my life. Sim. Would it were gone By one means or other, what a long day Will this be ere night? Cre. Simonides. Sim. Heer sit—weeping. Cre. Wherfore dost thou weep? Clean. Cause you make no more haste to your end. Sim. How can you question nature so unjustly? I had a grandfather, and then had not you True filiall tears for him? Clean. Hypocrite, A disease of drought dry up all pity from him That can dissemble pity with wet eyes Cre. Be good unto your mother Simonides, She must be now your care. Anti. To what end sir? The bell of this sharp edict towls for me As it rings out for you, Ile be as ready With one hours stay to goe along with you. Cre. Thou must not woman, there are years behind Before thou canst set forward in this voyage, And nature sure will now, be kind to all: She has a quarrell int, a cruell Law Seeks to prevent her, sheel therfore fight int And draw out life even to her longest thred Thou art scarce fifty five. Anti. So many morrowes, Those five remaining yeares ile turne to daies To houres or minutes for thy company, Tis fit that you and I being man and wife Should walke together arme in arme. Sim. I hope they'l goe together, I would they would i faith, Then would her thirds be sav'd to, the day goes away sir. Cre. Why wouldst thou have me gone Simonides? Sim. O my hart, would you have me gone before you sir? You give mee such a deadly wound. Clean. fine rascall. Sym. Blemish my duty so with such a question, Sir I would hast me to the Duke for mercie, He thats above the Law may mitigate The rigor of the Law how a good meaning May be corrupted by misconstruction? Cre. Thou corrupt'st mine, I did not thinke thou meanest so. Clean. You were in the more error. Sym. The words wounded me. Clean. Twas pittie thou diedst not ont. Sym. I have beene ransaking the helps of Law Conferring with these learned advocates, If any scruple cause or wrested sence Could have been found out to preserve your life, It had beene bought though with your full estate, Your lifes so pretious to me, but there is none. 1. Law. Sit we have canvas'd it from top to toe, Turnd it upside downe, threw her on her side Nay opend and dissected all her intrayles Yet can finde none, theres nothing to be hopd But the Dukes mercie. Sym. I know the hope of that, He did not make the Law for that purpose. Cre. Then to his hopelesse mercy last I goe, I have so many presidents before me. I must call it hopelesse Antigona, See me deliverd up unto my deaths man And then weell part five years hence ile looke for thee. Sim. I hope sheel not stay so long behind you. Cre. Do not bate him an houre by griefe and sorrow Since theres a day prefixed, haste it not, Suppose me sick Antigona, dying now Any Disease thou wile may be my end Or when Deaths slow to come, say Tyrants send Exeunt. Sim. Cleanthes if you want money, to morrow use me, Ile trust you while your fathers dead. Exeunt. Clean. Why heres a villaine. Able to corrupt a thousand by example, Does the kind root bleede out his livelihood In parent distribution to his branches, Adorning them with all his glorious fruits, Proud that his pride is seen when hees unseen, And must not gratitude discend agen To comfort his old limbs in fruitlesse winter Improvident, at least partiall nature Weak women in this kinde, who in thy last Teeming still forgets the former, ever making The burthen of thy last throws the dearest Darling; oh yet in noble man reform it, And make us better then those v get ves, Whose soules die within em; nature as thou art old, If love and justice be not dead in thee, Make some the patern of thy piety, Lest all doe turn unnaturally against thee, And thou be blam'd for our oblivions Enter Leonides and Hippolita. And brutish reluctations; I heers the ground Whereon my filiall faculties must build An edifice of honour or of shame To all mankind. Hip. You must avoid it sir: If there be any love within your selfe, This is far more then fare of a lost game That another venture may restore agen; It is your life which you should not subject To any cruelty if you can preserve it. Clean. O dearest woman, thou hast now doubled A thousand times thy nuptiall dowry to me; Why she whose love is but deriv'd from me Is got before me in my debted duty. Hip. Are you thinking such a resolution sir? Cle. Sweetest Hippolita what love taught thee To be so forward in so good a cause? Hip. Mine own pity sir, did first instruct me And then your love and power did both command me. Cle. They were all blessed angels to direct thee, And take their counsell; how doe you fare sir? Leon. Never better Cleanthes, I have conceiv'd Such a new joy within this old bosome, As I did never think would there have entred. Cle. Joy call you it, alas tis sorrow sir, The worst of sorrows, sorrow unto death. Leon. Death, whats that Cleanthes, I thought not ont? I was in contemplation of this woman, Tis all thy comfort son, thou hast in her A treasure unvaluable, keep her safe; When I die, sure twilbe a gentle death; For I will die with wonder of her vertues, Nothing else shall dissolve me. Clean. 'Twere much better sir, Could you prevent their malice. Leon. Ile prevent em, And die the way I told thee, in the wonder Of this good woman, I tell thee thers few men Have such a child (I must thank thee for her) That the stronger tie of wedlock should doe more Then nature in her neerest ligaments Of blood and propagation, I should neer Have begot such a daughter of my own: A daughter in law, law were above nature Were there more such children. Cle. This admiration Helps nothing to yeur safety, think of that sir. Leon. Had you heard her Cleanthes but labour In the search of means to save my forfet life, And knew the wise and sound preservations That she found out, you would redouble all My wonder in your love to her. Cle. The thought, The very thought claims all that from me, And shees now possest of it, but good sir, If you have ought receiv'd from her advice, Lets follow it, or else lets better think, And take the surest course. Leon. Ile tell thee one, She counsels me to flie my severe Country, Turn all into treasure, and there build up My decaying fortunes in a safer soyle, Where Epires law cannot claim me. Cle. And sir, I apprehend it as a safest course And may be easily accomplished; Let us be all most expeditious Every Country where we breath will be our own, Or better soile; heaven is the roof of all, And now as Epires situate by this law, There is twixt us and heaven a dark eclipse. Hip. Oh then avoid it sir, these sad events Follow those black predictions. Leon. I prithee peace, I doe allow thy love Hippolita, But most not follow it as counsell, child; I must not shame my Country for the law: This Country heer hath bred me, brought me up, And shall I now refuse a grave in her? I'me in my second infancy? and children Nere sleep so sweetly in their nurses cradle As in their naturall mothers. Hip, I but sir, She is unnaturall, then the stepmother Is to be preferd before her. Leon. Tush, she shall Allow it me dispite of her intrailes; Why doe you think how far from judgement tis That I should travell forth to seek a grave That is already digd for me at home, Nay perhaps find it in my way to seek it? How have I then sought a repentant sorrow? For your dear loves how have I banishd you From your Country ever with my base attempt How have I beggerd you in wasting that Which only for your sakes I bred together, Buried my name in Epire which I built Upon this frame to live for ever in. What a base coward shall I be to flie From that enemy which every minute meets me? And thousand odds he had not long vanquishd me Before this howr of battell, fly my death I will not be so false unto your states, Nor fainting to the man thats yet in me, Ile meet him bravely, I cannot (this knowing) fear That when I am gone hence I shalbe there, Come, I have dayes of preparation left. Cle. Good sir, hear me: I have a Genius that has prompted me, And I have almost formed it into words, Tis done, pray you observe em, I can conceale you And yet not leave your Country. Leon. Tush, it cannot be Without a certain perill ons all. Clean. Danger must be hazarded rather then accept A sure destruction; you have a Lodge sir, So far remote from way of passengers, That seldome any mortall eye does greet with it, And yes so sweetly situate with thickets Built with such cunning Laborinths within, As if the provident heavens foreseeing cruelty Had bid you frame it to this purpose only. Leon. Fie, fie, tis dangerous, and treason to, To abuse the law, Hip. Tis holy care sir, Of your dear life, which is your own to keep, But not your own to lose, either in will Or negligence. Cle. Call you it treason sir, I had been then a traitor unto you, Had I forgot this, beseech you accept of it, It is secure, and a duty to your selfe. Leon. What a coward will you make me? Cle. You mistake, Tis noble courage, now you fight with death, And yeeld not to him till you stoop under him. Leon. This must needs open to discovery, And then what tortor followes? Cle. By what means sir? Why theres but one body in all this counsell, Which cannot betray it selfe, we two are one, One soule, one body, one heart, that think all one thought, And yet we two are not compleatly one, But as have deriv'd my selfe from you, Who shall betray us where there is no second? Hip. You must not mistrust my faith though my sex Plead weak and frailty for me. Leon. Oh I dare not! But wheres the means that must make answer for me I cannot be lost without a full accompt, And what must pay that reckoning? Cle. Oh sir, we will Keep solemn obits for your funerall; Weell seem to weep, and seem to joy withall That death so gently has prevented you The Lawes sharp rigor, and this no mortall ear Shall participate the knowledge of. Leon. Ha, ha, ha, This wilbe a sportive fine Demur, If the Error be not found. Cle. Pray doubt of none Your company and best prouision Must be no further furnisht then by us, And in the interim your solitude May converse with heaven, and fairly prepare Which was too violent and raging Thrown headlong on you. Leo. Still there are some doubts Of the discovery, yet I doe allow't. Hip. Will you not mention now the cost and charge Which wilbe in your keeping? Leon. That wilbe somewhat Which you might save to. Cle. With his will against him; What foe is more to man then man himselfe? Are you resolv'd sir? Leon. I am Cleanthes: If by this means I doe get a reprieve And cozen death a while, when he shall come Arm'd in his own power to give the blow, Ile smile upon him then, and laughing goe. Exeunt.

As weeping Brides receive their joyes at night my Lord, With trembling yet with patience. Duke. Why twas well. 1. Cour. Nay I knew my Father would doe well my Lord. When ere he came to die, i'de that opinion of him, Which made me the more willing to part from him; He was not fit to live i'th world indeede any time these Ten yeares my Lord. But I would not say so much. Duke. No, you did not well int, For he thats all spent is ripe for death at all houers, And does but trifle time out, 1. Cour. Troath my Lord, I would I had knowne your minde nine yeares agoe, Duke, Our Law is fourscore years, because we judge Dotage compleat then, as unfruitfullnesse In Women at threescore, marrie if the son Can within compasse bring good sollid proofes Of his own fathers weaknes and unfitnes To live or sway the living though he want five Or ten yeares of his number, thats not it, His defect makes him fourscore, and tis fit He dies when he deserves, for every act Is in effect then when the cause is ripe. 2. Court. An admirable Prince how rarely he talks? Oh that w'eed knowne this Ladds, what a time did we endure In two penny Commons? and in bootes twice vamp'd. 1. Cour. Now we have two paire a weeke, &amp; yet not thankfull, Twill be a fine world for them sirs that come after us. 2. Cour. I and they knewt. 2. Cou. Peace let them never knowt. 3. Cour. A Pox there be yong heires will soone smelt out. 2. Court. Twill come to em by instinct man, may your grace Never be old, you stand so well for youth. Duke. Why now me thinks our Court lookes like a Spring, Sweet, fresh, and fashionable, now the old weeds are gon. 1. Cour. Tis as a Court should be: Glosse and good Clothes, My Lord no matter for merit and herein your Law prooves a provident act my Lord, when men passe not the palsie of their Tongues, nor colour in their Cheeks. Duke. But women by that Law should live long, For th'are neer past it. 1. Cour. It will have heates though when they see the painting Goe an inch deep ith wrincle, and take up A box more then their Gossips, but for men my Lord That should be the sole bravery of a Pallace, To walke with hollow eyes and long white beards, (As if a Prince dwelt in a Land of Goates) With Clothes as if they sat upon their backs on purpose To arraigne a fashion and condemn't to exile Their pockets in their sleeves, as if they layd Their eare to avarice, and heard the Divell whisper; Now ours lie downward heere close to the flanck, Right spending pockets as a sonnes should be That lives ith fashion, where our diseased fathers Would with the Sciatica and Aches Brought up your paind hose first, which Ladies laught at, Giving no reverence to the place, (lies ruind,) They love a doublet thats three houres a buttoning, And sits so close makes a man groane agen, And his Soule matter halfe a day; yet these are those That carry sway and worth, prickd up in Clothes, Why should we feare our rising? Duk. You but wrong Our kindnesse, and your owne deserts to doubt ont, Has not our Law made you rich before your time? Our countenance then can make you honourable. 1. Court. Weel spare for no cost sir to appeare worthy. Duk. Why y'are i'th noble way then, for the most Are but appearers, worth it selfe it is lost And bravery stands fort.

Duke. Old Creon you have been expected long, Sure y'are above fourscore. Sim. Upon my life Not four and twenty houres my Lord, I search'd The Church Booke yesterdaie, does your Grace think I'de let my Father wrong the Law my Lord? Twere pitty a'my life then, no your Act Shall not receive a minutes wrong by him While I live sir, and hee's so just himselfe too I know he would no offer't, heere he stands. Creon. Tis just I die indeed my Lord, for I confesse I'me troublesome to life now, and the State Can hope for nothing worthy from me now, Either in force or counsell, I've alate Employd my selfe quite from the World, and he that once Begins to serve his maker faithfully Can never serve a worldly Prince well after, Tis cleane another way. Anti. Oh give not confidence To all he speaks my Lord in his own injury! His preparation only for the next world Makes him talk wildly to his wrong of this, He is not lost in judgement. Sim. She spoils all agen. Anti. Deserving any way for state imploiment. Sim. Mother. Anti. His very houshold laws prescrib'd at home by him Are able to conform 7. Christian kingdomes, They are so wise and vertuous. Sim. Mother, I say. Anti. I know your lawes extend not to desert sir, But to unnecessary years, and my Lord His are not such, though they shew white, they'r worthy, Juditious, able, and religious. Sim. Ile help you to a Courtier of nineteen, Mother. Anti. Away unnaturall. Sim. Then I am no fool I'me sure, For to be naturall at such a time Were a fool s part indeed. Anti. Your Graces pity sir, And tis but fit and just. Creon. The law my Lord, And thats the justest way. Sim, Well said father ifaith. Thou wert ever juster then my mother still. Duke. Come hither sir. Sim. My Lord. Du. What are those orders? Antig. Worth observation sir, So please you hear them read. Sim. The woman speaks she knows not what my Lord: He make a Law, poor man he bought a Table indeed, Only to learn to die by't; ther's the busines now Wherein there are some precepts for a son to, How he should learn to live, but I neer lookt upont: For when hees dead I shall live well enough, And keep a better Table then that I trow. Du. And is that all sir? Sim. All I vow my Lord, Save a few running admonitions Upon Cheese Trenchers, as Take heed of whoring, shun it; Tis like a cheese too strong of the Runnet, And such calves maws of wit and admonition Good to catch mice with, but not sons and heirs, They'r not so easily caught. Du. Agent for death. Exe. Your will my Lord. Du. Take hence that pile of years Before surfet with unprofitable age And with the rest from the high promontory, Cast him into the sea. Creon. Tis noble justice. Anti. Tis cursed tyranny. Sim. Peace, take heed mother, you have but a short time to bee cast down your selfe, and let a yong Courtier doo't, and you bee wise, in the mean time. Anti. Hence slave. Sim. Well seven and fifty, Yave but three years to scold, then comes your payment, 1. Court. Simonides. Sim.

Yet suitable to his behaviour, mark it, He comes all the way smiling, do you observ't? I never saw a Coarse so joyfully followed, Light colours and light cheeks, who should this be? Tis a thing worth resolving. Sim. One belike that doth participate In this our present joy. Du. Cleanthes, Clean. Oh my Lord. Du. He laught outright now, Was ever such a contrariety seen In naturall courses yet, nay profest openly? 1. Cour. I ha known a widow laugh closely my Lord Under her hankercher, when tother part of her old face has wept Like rain in sunshine, but all the face to laugh apparantly Was never seen yet. Sim. Yes mine did once. Clean. Tis of a heavy time the joyfullst day That ever son was born to. Du. How can that be! Clean. I joy to make it plain, my father's dead. Du. Dead! 2. Cour. Old Leonides. Clean. In his last month dead, He beguil'd cruell Law the sweetliest Thae ever age was blest to, It grieves me that a tear should fall upont, Being a thing so joyfull; but his memory Will work it out I see; when his poor heart broke I did not so much but leapt for joy, So mountingly I touchd the stars me thought, I would not hear of blacks I was so light, But chose a colour Orient, like my mind, For blacks are often such dissembling mourners, There is no credit given toot, it has lost All reputation by false sons and widows; Now I would have men know what I resemble, A truth indeed, tis joy clad like a joy, Which is more honest then a cunning griefe That's only fac'd with sables for a shew, But gawdy hearted; when I saw death come So ready to deceive you, sir forgive me, I could not choose but be intirely merry, And yet to see now of a sudden Naming but Death, I shew my selfe a mortall, Thats never constant to one passion long; I wonder whence that tear came when I smild, In the production on't, sorrows a thiefe, That can when joy looks on steal forth a griefe, But gracious leave my Lord, when I have performd My last poor duty to my fathers bones, I shall return your servant. Du, Well perform it, The Law is satisfied, they can but die, And by his death Cleanthes you gain well, A rich and faire revenew. Florish Sim. I would I had een another father, condition he did the like Clean. I have past it bravely, now how blest was I To have the dim sight, now tis confirmd Past fear or doubts confirmd, on on I say, He that brought me to man I bring to clay. Sim. I'me wrapt now in a contemplation, Even at the very sight of yonder Hearse, I doe but think what a fine thing tis now To live and follow some seven unkles thus, As many Cozen Germans, and such people That will leave Legacies, a pox Ide see em hangd else ere Ide follow One of them, and they could finde the way now Ive enough to begin to be horrible covetous. Enter Butler, Tailor, Bayly, Cook, Coachman, and Footman. But. We come to know your Worships pleasure sir, Having long serv'd your father, how your good will Stands towards our entertainment. Sim. Not a jot i faith: My father wore cheap garments, he might doot, I shall have all my Clothes come home to morrow, they will eat up all you, and there were more of you sirs; to keepe you sixe at Livery and still munching. Tay. Why I'me a Taylor, y'ave most need of me sir. Sim. Thou madest my fathers clothes that I confesse, But what sonne and heir will have his fathers Taylor Unlesse he have a mind to be well laught at? Thast beene so us'd to wide long side things, that when I come to trusse I shall have the waste of my Dublet lie upon my buttocks, a sweet sight. But. I a Butler. Sim. Theres least neede of thee fellow, I shall nere drinke at Home, I shall be so drunke abroad. But. But a cup of small beere will do well next morning sir Sim. I grant you, but what neede I keepe so big a knave for a Cup of small Beere? Cooke. Butler you have your answer, marry sir a Cooke, I know your mastership cannot be without. Sim. The more asse art thou to think so, for what should I doe With a Mountebancke, no drinke in my house, the banishing the Butler might have beene a warning for thee, unlesse thou meanst to Choake me. Cooke. Ith meane time you have choaked me, me thinks. Bay. These are superfluous vanities indeed, And so accounted of in these dayes sir, But then your Bayliff to receive your rents. Sim. I prithee hold thy tongue fellow, I shall take a course to spend em faster then thou canst reckon em, tis not the rents must serve my turne, unlesse I meane to be laughed at, if a man should be seene out of flash me, let him nere look to be a right gallant: But sirrah with whom is your businesse? Coach Your good mastership. Sim. You have stood silent all this while, like men That know their strengths i'these dayes, none of you Can want imployment, you can winne me wagers Footman in running races. Foot I dare boast it sir. Sim. And when my bets are all come in and store Then Coachman you can hurry me to my whore. Coach. Ile firke em into foame else. Sim. Speaks brave matter, And ile firk some to, or't shall cost hot water. Cooke. Why heares an age to make a Cooke a Ruffin, and scald the Divell indeed, doe strange mad things, make mutton pasties of Dogs flesh, backe Snakes for Lamprie Pies, and Cats for Cunnies: But. Come will you bee ruld by a Butlers advice once? for wee must make up our fortunes some where now as the case stands, lets een therefore goe seeke out widdowes of nine and fiftie and we can, thats within a yeare of their deaths, and so we shall bee sure to bee quickly ridd of em, for a yeares enough of conscience to bee troubled with a wife for any man living.

Yes, you must make some spoone meat for your father, And warme three night capps for him, out apont The meer conceit turns a yong womans stomack, His slippers must be warmd in August too, And his gowne girt to him in the very dogdaies When every Mastiffe lols outs tongue for heat, Would not this vex a beauty of 19. now? Alas I shall be tumbling in cold Bathes now Under each arme pit a fine beane flower bag To screw out whitenesse when I lift, And some seaven of the proprest men ith Dukedome, Making a Banquet ready ith next roome for me, Where he that gets the first kisse is envied And stands upon his guard a fornight after; This is a life for nineteene, but tis justice For old men, whose great acts stand in their minds And nothing in their bodies, doe nere think A woman yong enough for their desire, And we yong wenches that have mother wits And love to marry muck first, and man after, Doe never thinke old men are old enough That we may soon be rid on em, theres our quittance; I have wasted for the happy houre this two yeare And if Death be so unkind still to let him live All that time I am lost. Enter Courtiers. 1. Cour. Young Lady. 2. Cour. O sweet precious bud of beauty! Troth she smells over all the house me thinks. 1. Court. The Sweet Briers but a counterfeit to her, It does exceeds you only in the prickle, But that it shall not long if youl be rul'd Lady. Eug. What meanes this suddain visitation Gentlemen?

Lisan. Whats thy wild businesse heere? Sim. Old man, i'le tell thee, I come to beg the reversion of thy Wife, I think these gallants be of my mind too, but thou art but I dead Man, therefore what should a man doe talking with thee, Come Widdow stand to your tickling. Lisan. Impious blood hounds. Sim. Let the Ghost talke, nere mind him. Lisan. Shames of nature. Sim. Alass poore Ghost, consider what the man is. Lisan. Monsters unnaturall, you that have beene covetous Of your own fathers deaths, gape yee for mine now? Cannot a poore old man that now can reckon Een all the houres he has to live, live quiet For such wild beasts as these, that neither hold A certainty of good within themselves, But scatter others comforts that are ripened For holy uses? is hot youth so hasty It will not give an old man leave to die? And leave a Widdow first, but will make one The Husband looking on, may your destructions Come all in hasty figures to your Soules, Your wealth depart in hast, to overtake Your honesties, that died when you were infants. May your male seed be hasty spend thrifts too? Your daughters hastie sinners and diseas'd Ere they be thought at yeares to welcome misery, And may you never know what leisure is But at repentance: I am too uncharitable Too foule, I must goe cleanse my selfe with prayers; These are the Plagues of fondnesse to old men Wee'r punisht home with what we doat upon. Exit. Sim. So so, the Ghost is vanish'd now, your answer Lady. Eug. Excuse me gentlemen, 'twere as much impudence In me to give you a kind answer yet, As madnesse to produce a churlish one. I could say now, come a month hence sweet gentlemen, Or two or three, or when you will indeed, But I say no such thing, I set no time Nor is it mannerly to deny any, Ile carry an even hand to all the world, Let other women make what hast they will, Whats that to me, but I profess unfainedly, Ile have my husband dead before I marry, Nere looke for other answer at my hands Gentlemen.

What will she doe heerafter when sh is a widow, Keeps open house already? Exeunt. Eug. How now Girle? Parth. Those featherd fools that hither took their flight, Have griev'd my father much. Eug. Speak well of youth Wench While th'ast a day to live; tis youth must make thee, And when youth fails, wise women will make it; But alwayes take age first to make thee rich: That was my counsell ever, and then youth Will make thee sport enough all thy life after. Tis Times policy Wench, what ist to bide A little hardness for a pair of years or so, A man whose only strength lies in his breath, Weaknes in all parts else, thy bedfellow A cough oth Lungs, or say a wheening matter, Then shake off chains, and dance all thy life after. Parth. Every one to their liking, but I say An honest man's worth all, be he yong or gray, Yonders my Cozen. Enter Hippolita. Eug. Art I must use thee now, Dissembling is the best help for a vertue That ever woman had, it saves their credit often. Hip. How now Cozen, What weeping? Eug. Can you blame me when the time Of my dear Love and Husband now drawes on; I study funerall tears against the day I must be a sad widow. Hip. In troth Eugenia I have cause to weep to, But when I visit, I come comfortably, And look to be so quited, yet more sobbing, Eug. Oh the greatest part of your affliction's past, The worst of mine's to come, I have one to die, Your husbands father is dead, and fixt In his eternall peace, past the sharp tyrannous blow. Hip. You must use patience Coze. Eug. Tell me of patience. Hip. You have example fort in me and many. Eug. Yours was a father in law, but mine a husband, On for a woman that could love and live With an old man, mine is a jewell Cozen, So quietly he lies by one, so still. Hip. Alas! I have a secret lodg'd within me Which now will out, in pity I can't hold. Eugen. One that will not disturb me in my sleep After a whole month together, lesse it be With those diseases age is subject to, As aches, coughes, and pains, and these heaven knows Against his will too, hees the quietest man, Especially in bed. Hip. Be comforted. Eug. How can I Lady? None knowes the terror of an husbands losse, But they that feare to lose him. Hip. Fain would I keep it in, but twill not be, She is my kinswoman, and i'me pitifull, I must impart a good if I knowt once, To them that stand in need ont, Ime like one Loves not to banquet with a joy alone, My friends must partake too, prithee cease Cozen If your love be so boundless, which is rare In a yong woman in these dayes, I tell you, To one so much past service as your husband, There is a way to beguile law, and help you, My husband sound it out first. Eug. Oh sweet Cozen! Hip. You may conceale him, and give out his death Within the time, order his funerall too; We had it so for ours, I prayse heaven fort, And hees alive and safe. Eug. O blessed Coze, How thou reviv'st me? Hip. We daily see The good old man, and feed him twice a day, Me thinks it is the sweetest joy to cherish him, That ever life yet shewd me. Eug. So should I think A dainty thing to nurse an old man well. Hip. And then we have his prayers and daily blessing. And we two live so lovingly upont, His son and I, and so contentedly, You cannot think unlesse you tasted ont. Eug. No I warrant you, Oh loving Cozen, What a great sorrow hast thou eas'd me of? A thousand thanks goe with thee. Hip. I have a suite to you, I must not have you weepe when I am gone. Exit. Eug. No, if I doe neer trust me: Easie fool, Thou hast put thy selfe into my power for ever: Take heed of angring of me; I conceal, I fain a Funerall, I keep my husband, Lasse I have been thinking any time these two years I have kept him too long already. Ile goe count ore my Suitors, thats my business, And prick the man down, I ha six months to doot, But could dispatch him in one, were I put toot. Exit. Finis Actus Secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. III. Scen. I. Enter the Clown and Clark. Clo. You have searcht ore the Parish Chronicle, sir? Clar. Yes sir, I have found out the true age and date of the party you wot on. Clo. Pray you be covered sir. Clar. When you have shewd me the way sir. Clo. Oh sir remember your selfe, you are a Clark. Clar. A small Clark sir. Clo. Likely to be the wiser man sir, for your greatest Clarks are not alwayes so, as tis reported. Clar. You are a great man in the Parish sir. Clo. I understand my self so much the better fit, for all the best in the Parish pay duties to the Clark, and I would ow you none sir. Clar. Since youl have it so, i'le be the first to hide my head. Clo. Mine is a capcass now to our busines in your hand, good luck I hope, I long to be resolv'd. Clar. Look you sir, this is that cannot deceive you, This is the Diall that goes ever true; You may say Ipse dixit upon this witnes, And tis good in Law too. Clo. Pray you lets hear what it speaks. Clar. Mark sir, Agatha the daughter of Pollux, this is your Wives name, and the name of her father, born. Clo. Whose daughter say you. Clar. The daughter of Pollux Clo. I take it his name was Bollux. Clar. Pollux the Orthography I assure you sir, the word is corrupted else. Clo. Well on sir of Pollux, now come on Castor. Clar. Born in an. 1540. and now tis 99. by this infallible record sir (let me see) she is now just 59. and wants but on. Clo. I am sorry she wants so much. Clar. Why sir? alas tis nothing, tis but so many months, so many weeks, so many— Clo. Do not deduct it to dayes, twill be the more tedious, and to measure it by houre glasses were intollerable. Clar. Doe not think on it sir, halfe the time goes away in sleep, tis halfe the yeare in nights. Clo. Oh you mistake me neighbour, I am loath to leave the good old woman, if shee were gone now it would not grieve mee, for what is a yeare alasse but a lingring torment? and were it not better she were out of her paine, t'must needs bee a griefe to us both. Clar. I would I knew how to ease you neighbour? Clo. You speake kindly truly, and if you say but Amen to it, (which is a word that I know you are perfect in) it might be don, Clarks are the most indifferent honest men, for to the marriage of your enemy, or the buriall of your friend, the Curses or the Blessings to you are all one, you say Amen to all. Clar. With a better will to the one then the other neighbour, but I shall be glad to say Amen to any thing might doe you a pleasure. Clo. There is first somthing above your duty, now I would have you set forward the Clock alittle, in to helpe the old woman out of her paine. Clar. I will speake to the Sexton for that, but the day will go nere the faster for that. Clo. Oh neighbour you doe not conceit mee, not the Jack of the Clock-house the hand of the Diall I meane, come, I know you being a great Clark, cannot chuse but have the art to cast a figure. Clar. Never indeed neighbour, I never had the judgement to cast a figure. Clo. I'le show you on the back side of your booke, looke you, what figures this. Clar. Four with a Cipher thats forty. Clo. So forty, whats this now? Clar. The Cipher is turn'd into 9. by adding the taile which makes forty nine. Clo. Very well understood, what i'st now? Clar. The 4. is turnd into 3. tis now thirty nine. Clo. Very well understood, and can you do this agen? Clar. Oh easily sir. Clo. A wager of that, let me see the place of my wives age agen. Clar. Looke you sir tis heere 1540. Clo. Forty drachmaes, you doe not turne that forty into thirty nine. Clar. A match with you. Clo. Done, and you shall keepe stakes your selfe there they are. Clar. A firme match, but stay sir now I consider it, I shall add a yeare to your wives age, let me see Scirophon the 17. and now tis Hecatomcaon the 11. if I alter this your wife will have but a month to live by the Law. Clo. Thats all one sir, either doe it or pay me my wager. Clar. Will you lose your wife before you lose your wager? Clo. A man may get two wives before halfe so much money by em, will you doot? Clar. I hope you will conceale me for tis flat corruption. Clo. Nay sir I would have you keepe counsell, for I lose my money by't and should be laught at for my labour, if it should bee known. Clar. Well sir, there tis done, as perfect 39. as can be found in black and white but mum sir, thers danger in this figure casting. Clo. I sir, I know that better men then you have beene throwne over the barr for as little, the best is, you can be but throwne out of the Belfrie. Enter the Cook, the Taylor, Bayliffe, and Butler. Clar. Lock close heere comes company, Asses have eares as well as Pitchers. Cook. Oh Gnothos, how i'st? heer's a trick of discarded Cards of us, wee were ranked with Coats as long as our old master lived. Clo. And is this then the end of Serving men? Cooke. Yes faith, this is the end of serving men, a wise man were better serve one God then all the men in the world. Clo. Twas well spak of a Cook, and are all faln into fasting daies and ember weeks, that Cooks are out of use? Tay. And all Taylors will bee cut into Lists and Shreds, if this world hold, we shall grow both out of request. But. And why not Butlers as well as Taylors, if they can goe naked, let em neither eat nor drink. Cla. Thats strange mee thinks, a Lord should turne away his Taylor of all men, and how dost thou Taylor? Tay. I do so so, but indeed all our wants are long of this Publican my Lords Bayliff, for had he been rent gatherer still, our places had held together still, that are now seame rent, nay crack'd in the whole peece. Bal. Sir, if my Lord had not sold his Lands that claime his Rents, I should still have beene the rent gatherer. Cook. The truth is, except the Coachman, and the Footman, all Serving men are out of request. Clo. Nay say not so, for you were never in more request then now; for requesting is but a kind of a begging, for when you say I beseech your Worships Charity, tis all one if you say I request it, and in that kind of requesting, I am sure serving men were never in more request. Cook. Troath hee sayes true, well let that passe, wee are upon a better adventure, I see Gnothos you have beene before us, we came to deale with this Merchant for some commodities. Clar. With me sir any thing that I can. But. Nay we have look'd out our Wives already, marry to you we come to know the prices, that is to know their ages for so much reverence we beare to age, that the more aged, they shall be the more deere to us. Tay. The truth is every man has laid by his Widdow, so they be lame enough, blinde enough, and old, tis good enough. Clar. I keepe the town stock, if you can but name em, I can tell their ages to day. Om. We can tell their fortunes to an houre then. Clar. Only you must pay for turning of the leaves. Cook. Oh bountifully, come mine first! But. The Butler before the Cooke while you live, thers few that eate before they drinke in a morning. Tay. Nay then the Taylor puts in his needle of priority, for men do cloth themselves before they either drink or eat. Bay. I will strive for no place, the longer ere I marry wife, the older shee will be, and nearer her end and my ends. Clar. I will serve you all gentlemen if you will have patience. Clo. I commend your modesty sir, you are a Bayliff whose place is to come behind other men, as it were in the bumm of all the rest. Bay. So sir, and you were about this businesse too, seeking out for a Widdow. Clo. Alack no sir, I am a married man, and have those cares upon me that you would faine runn into. Bay. What an old rich wife, any man in this age desires such a care. Clo. Troath sir I'le put a venter with you if you will, I have a lusty old queane to my wife, sound of wind and limb, yet I'le give out to take three for one, at the marriage of my second wife. Bay. I sir, but how neere is shee to the Law? Clo. Take that at hazard sir, there must bee time you know to get a new: Unsight, unseen, I take 3. to one. Bay. Two to one I'le give if shee have but two teeth in her head. Clo. A match, theres five drachmes for ten at my next wife. Bay. A match. Cook. I shall be fitted bravely, fifty eight and upwards, tis but a yeare and a halfe, and I may chance make friends, and beg a yeare of the Duke. But. Hey boyes I am made sir Butler, my wife that shall bee wants but two months of her time, it shall bee one ere I marry her, and then the next will be a hunny moon. Tay. I out strip you all, I shall have but six weeks of Lent, if I get my Widdow, and then comes eating tide plump and gorgious. Clo. This Taylor will be a man if ever there were any. Bay. Now comes my turn, I hope goodman Finis, you that are still at the end of all with a so be it, well now sirs, doe you venter there as I have done? and ile venter heereafter you, good luck I beseech thee. Clar. Amen sir. Bay. That deserves a fee already, there tis, please me and have a better. Clar. Amen sir. Cook. How two for one at your next wife, is the old one living? Clo. You have a faire Match, I offer you no foule one, if Death make not hast to call her, shee'l make none to go to him. But. I know her, shees a lusty woman, I'le take the venter. Clo. Theres five drachmaes for ten at my next wife. But. A bargain. Cook. Nay then weel be all Merchants give me. Tay. And me. But. What has the Bayliff sped? Bay. I am content, but none of you shall know my happiness. Clar. As well as any of you all believe it sir. Bay. Oh Clarke you are to speak last alwayes. Clar. I'le remember't hereafter sir. you have done with mee Gentlemen? Enter Wife. Om. For this time honest Register. Clar. Fare you well then, if you do, I'le cry Amen toot. Exit. Cook. Looke you sir is not this your Wife? Clo. My first wife sir. But. Nay then we have made a good match ont, if she have no froward Disease, the Woman may live this dozen yeares by her age. Tay. I'me afraid shees broken winded, shee holds silence so long. Cook. Weel now leave our venter to the event, I must a wooing. But. Ile but buy me a new dagger, and overtake you. Bay. So we must all, for he that goes a wooing to a Widdow without a weapon will never get her. Exeunt. Clo. Oh Wife, Wife! Wife. What ayle you man you speake so passionatly. Clo. Tis for thy sake sweet wife, who would thinke so lusty an old woman, with reasonable good teeth, and her tongue in as perfect use as ever it was, should bee so neere her time, but the Fates will have it so? Wife. Whats the matter man, you doe amaze me? Clo. Thou art not sick neither I warrant thee. Wife. Not that I know of sure. Clo. What pitty tis a woman should bee so neere her end, and yet not sick. Wife. Neere her end man, tush I can guesse at that, I have yeares good yet of life in the remainder, I want two yet at least of the full number, Then the Law I know craves impotent and useless And not the able women. Clo. I alas I see thou hast beene repairing time as well as thou couldst, the old wrinckles are well fild up, but the Vermilion is seene too thick, too thick, and I read whats written in thy forehead, it agrees with the Church Booke. Wife. Have you sought my age man, and I preethee how is it? Clo. I shall but discomfort thee. Wife. Not at all man, when there's no remedy, I will go though unwillingly. Clo. 1539. Just it agrees with the Booke, you have about a yeare to prepare your selfe. Wife. Out alas, I hope theres more then so, but doe you not thinke a repreeve might be gotten for halfe a score, and twere but five yeare, I would not care, an able woman (me thinks) were to be pittied. Clo. I to be pittied, but not help'd, no hope of that, for indeed women have so blemishd their own reputations now a dayes, that it is thought the Law will meet them at fifty very shortly. Wife. Marry the Heavens forbid. Clo. Theres so many of you that when you are old become Witches, some professe Physick, and kill good subjects faster then a burning Feavour; and then Schoolemistresses of the sweet sinne, which commonly we call Bawds innumerable of that sort: for these and such causes tis thought they shall not live above fifty. Wife. I man but this hurts not the good old women. Clo. I faith you are so like one another, that a man cannot distinguish 'em now; were I an old woman I would desire to goe before my time, and offer my selfe willingly, 2. or 3. yeares before; oh those are brave women and worthy to bee commended of all men in the world that when their Husbands die they run to bee burnt to death with em, theres honor and credit, give mee halfe a dozen such wives. Wife. I if her Husband were dead before, 'twere a reasonable request, if you were dead I could be content to be so. Clo. Fie, thats not likely, for thou hadst two husbands before me. Wife. Thou wouldst not have me die, would'st thou husband? Clo. No I do not speake to that purpose, but I say what credit it were for mee and thee, if thou would'st, then thou shouldst never bee suspected for a Witch, a Physitian, a Bawd, or any of those things, and then how daintily should I mourne for thee, how bravelie should I see thee buried, when alas if hee goes before it cannot choose but bee a great griefe to him to thinke hee has not seene his wife well buried, there be such vertuous women in the world, but too few, too few who desire to die 7. yeares before their time with all their hearts. Wife. I have not the heart to be of that mind, but indeed Husband I think you would have me gone. Clo. No alas I speake but for your good and your credit, for when a woman may die quickly, why should shee goe to Law for her Death, alack I neede not wish thee gone, for thou hast but a short time to stay with me, you do not know how neare tis, it must out, you have but a month to live by the Law. Wife. Out alas. Clo. Nay scarce so much. Wife. Oh, oh, oh, my heart! Swouns. Clo. I so, if thou wouldst go away quietly twere sweetly done, and like a kind wife, lie but a little longer and the bell shall towle for thee. Wife. Oh my hart, but a month to live. Clo. Alas why wouldst thou come back agen for a month, i'le throw her downe agen, oh woman tis not three weeks, I thinke a fortnight is the most. Wife. Nay then I am gone allready. Swouns. Clo. I would make hast to the Sexton now, but I'me afraid the towling of the Bell will wake her agen; if she be so wise as to goe now, she stirs agen, ther's two lives of the nine gone. Wife. Oh wouldst not thou helpe to recover mee husband? Clo. Alas, I could not find in my heart to hold thee by thy nose, or box thy cheeks, it goes against my conscience. Wife. I will not be thus frighted to my Death, I'le search the Church Record a fortnight Tis too little of conscience, I cannot be so neare, Oh time if thou beest kind lend me but a yeare. Exit. Clo. What a spites this, that a man cannot perswade his wife to dye in any time with her good will, I have another bespoke already, though a peece of old beefe will serve to breakfast, yet a man would be glad of a Chicken to supper; the Clarke I hope understands no Hebrew, and cannot write backward what hee hath writ forward already, and then I am well enough: tis but a month at most, if that were gon My venter comes in with her two for one, Tis use enough a consci?ce for a brother if he had a consci?ce. Exit. Enter Eugenia at one Dore, Simonides, Courtiers at the other. Eug. Gentlemen Courtiers. 1. Cour. All your servants vowd Lady. Oh I shall kill my selfe with infinite laughter!

Beat folly in her owne ground wondrous much Why may not we be held as full sufficient To love our owne wives, then get our owne children And live in free peace till we be dissolved? For such spring Butterflies that are gawdie wingd, But no more substance then those Shamble flies Which Butchers boyes snap betweene sleepe and waking, Come but to crush you once you are all but maggots, For all your beamy out sides. Enter Cleanthes Eug. Heeres Cleanthes, He comes to chide let him alone a little, Our cause will be reveng'd, look, look his face Is set for stormy weather, do but marke How the Clouds gather in't, 'twil powre downe straight. Clean. Me thinks I partly know you, thats my griefe Could you not all be lost that had beene handsome, But to be known at all tis more then shamefull, Why was not yeur name wont to be Lisander? Lis. Tis so still coze. Clean. Judgement defer thy comming, else this mans miserable. Eug. I told you there would be a showre anon. 2. Cour. Weel in and hide our noddles. Exeunt Courtiers &amp; Eugenia. Clean. What Divel brought this colour to your mind, Which since yeur childhood I neare saw you weare, You were ever of an innocent gloss Since I was ripe for knowledge, and would you lose it And change the Livery of Saints and Angels For this mixt monstrousnes, to force a ground That has been so long hallowed like a Temple, To bring forth fruits of earth now, and turn black To the wild cries of lust, and the complexion Of Sin in act, lost and long since repented; Would you begin a work nere yet attempted; To pul time backward? See what your wife wil do, are your wits perfect? Lis. My witts. Clean. I like it ten times worse for t'ad been safer Now to be mad, and more excusable. I heare you dance agen and do strange follies. Lis. I must confesse I have been put to some coze. Clean. And yet you are not mad, pray say not so Give me that comfort of you that you are mad That I may think you are at worst, for it You are not mad, I then must guesse you have The first of some Disease was never heard of, Which may be worse then madness, and more fearfull, Youd weep to see your selfe else, and your care To pray wou'd quickly turne you white agen. I had a father had he livd his month out But to ha seen this most prodigious folly, There needed not the Law to have cut him off: The sight of this had prov'd his executioner, and broke his heart, He would have held it equall Done to a Sanctuary, for what is age But the holy place of life, Chapel of ease For all mens wearied miseries, and to rob That of her Ornament, it is accurst, As from a Priest to steale a holy Vestment, I and convert it to a sinfull covering. Exit Lisander. I see ta's done him good, blessing go with it, Enter Eugenia. Such as may make him pure agen. Eug. Twas bravely touch'd I faith sir. Clean. Oh y'are welcome. Eug. Exceedingly well handled. Clean. Tis to you I come, he fell but i'my way. Eug. You markd his beard Cosen. Clean. Mark me. Eug. Did you ever see a haire so changd? Clean. I must be forcd to wake her lowdly to, The Divel has rock'd her so fast asleep, Strumpet. Eug. Do you call sir? Clean. Whore. Eug. How doe you sir? Clean. Be I nere so well I must be sick of thee, th'art a Disease That stickest t'oth heart, as all such women are. Eug. What ailes our kindred? Clean. Blesse me she sleeps still, what a dead modesty is i'this woman? Will never blush agen, look on thy work, But with a Christian eye, 'twould turn thy heart Into a showre of blood to be the cause Of that old mans destruction, think upont Ruine eternally, for through thy loose follies Heaven has found him a faint servant lately, His goodness has gone backward, and ingendred With his old sins again, has lost his prayers And all the tears that were companions with em And like a blind fold man, giddy and blinded Thinking he goes right on still, swerves but one foot And turnes to the same place where he set out, So he that tooke his farwell of the world And cast the joyes behind him out of sight, Sum'd up his houres, made even with time and men Is now in heart arriv'd at youth agen; All by thy wildness thy too hasty lust Has driven him to this strong apostacy, Immodesty like thine was never equald Ive heard of women, (shall I call em so) Have welcomd suitors ere the Corps were cold, But thou thy Husband living, thou art too bold. Eug. Well have you done now sir? Clean. Look, look she smiles yet. Eug. All this is nothing to a mind resolvd, Ask any woman that, sheel tell you so much You have only showne a pretty sawcy wit, Which I shal not forget nor to requite it, You shal heare from me shortly: Clean. Shamelesse woman, I take my counsel from thee tis too honest And leave thee wholly to thy stronger master, Blesse the sex of thee from thee, thats my Prayer Were al like thee so impudently common, No man would be found to wed a woman.

Hip. Though it be never lost, and if our watchfulness Ought to be wise and serious against a thiefe That comes to steale our goods, things all without us, That proves vexation often more then comfort, How mighty ought our providence to be To prevent those? if any such there were That come to rob our bosome of our joyes, That only makes poore man delight to live: Psha, i'me too fearful fie, fie, who can hurt me? But tis a general cowardice that shakes, The nerves of confidence, he that hides treasure Imagins every one thinks of that place When tis a thing least minded, nay let him change The place continually where ere it keeps, There wil the feare keepe stil, yonders the store house Enter Hippolita.

Oh miserable vertue, what distresse art thou in at this minute? Clean. Help me thunder For my powers lost, Angels shoot plagues and help me: Why are these men in health and I so heart sick? Or why should nature have that power in me To leavy up a thousand bleeding sorrowes And not one comfort, onely makes me lie Like the poore mockery of an Earthquake heere? Panting with horror, and have not so much force in all my vengeance. To shake a villain off a mee, Enter Courtiers, Simonides, Leonides. Hip. Use him gently and Heaven will love you fort. Clean. Father, oh Father now I see thee full In thy affection, thou'rt a man of sorrow But reverently becomst it, that's my comfort, Extremity was never better grac'd Then with that looke of thine, oh let me look still For I shall lose it, all my joy and strength Is een Ecclips'd together, I transgrest Your Law my Lord, let me receive the sting ont Be once just sir, and let the offender die Hees innocent in all, and I am guilty. Leo. Your grace knowes when affection only speaks Truth is not alwaies there, his love would draw An undeservd misery on his youth, And wrong a peace resolv'd, on both parts sinfull; Tis, I am guilty of my owne concealment And like a worldly coward injurd heaven With feare to go toot, now I see my fault, And am prepard with joy to suffer fort. Duke. Go give him quick dispatch, let him see death And your presumption sir shall come to judgement. Exeunt with Leonides. Hip. Hees going, oh hees gon sir. Clean. Let me rise. Hip. Why doe you not then, and follow? Clean. I strive fort Is their no hand of pitty that will ease me And take this villaine from my heart a while? Hip. Alas hees gone. Clean. A worse supplies his place then, A weight more pondrous, I cannot follow. Hip. Oh misery of affliction. Clean.

Hip. That hopes wretched. Clean.

I expect it And as to these I look no mercy from And much lesse showne to intrest it, I thus now Submit me the Emblemes of your power I meane The Sword and Bench but my most reverend judges Ere you proceed to sentence, for I know You have given me lost, will you resolve me one thing? 1. Cour. So it be breefly questioned. 2. Cour. Shew your honor, Day spends it selfe a pace. Clean. My Lords it shall Resolve me then where are your filliall tears Your mourning habits and sad hearts become. That should attend your fathers funerall Though the strick Law which I will not accuse Because a subject snatcht away their lives It doth not barr them to lament their deaths Or if you cannot spare one sad suspire It doth not bid you laugh them to their graves Lay subtle traines to antidate their yeares, To be the sooner ceas'd of their estates. Oh time of age wheres that Eneas now Who letting all his Jewels to the flames. Forgetting country kindred treasure friends Fortunes and all things save the name of son Which you so much forget, goe like Eneas Who tooke his bedrid father on his back And with that sacred load (to him no burden) Hewd out his way through blood, through fire, through Even all the armed streets of bright burning Troy, Onely to save a father. Sim. We have no leasure now To heare lessons read from Virgill, wee are past schoole, And all this time thy judges. 2. Cour. Tis fit, That we proceed to sentence. 1. Cour. You are the mouth And now tis fit to open. Sim. Justice indeed Should ever be close ear'd, and open mouthd That is to heare him little, and speake much Low then Cleanthes there is none can be A good son and a bad subject, for if Princes Be cald the peoples fathers then the subjects Are all his sones, and he that flouts the Prince Doth disobey his father, there yeare gone. 1. Cour. And not to be recovered. Sim. And again. 2. Cour. If he be gone once call him not againe. Sim. I say againe this act of thine expresses A double disobedience, as our Princes Are fathers, so they are our soveraignes too, And he that doth rebell against soveraignety Doth commit treason in the height of degree And now thou art quite gone. 1. Cour. Our brother in commission Hath spoke his mind both learnedly and neatly, And I can add but little, howsoever Ie shall send him packing. He that begins a fault that wants example Ought to be made example for the fault. Clean. A fault no longer can I hold my selfe To heare vice upheld and vertue throwne downe, A fault judge then, I desire where it lyeth In those that are my judges or in mee Heaven stand on my side pitty love and duty. Sim. Where are they sir who fees them but your selfe. Clean. Not you, and I am sure, You never had the gracious eyes to see them, You think you arraigne me, but I hope To sentence you at the Bar. 2. Cour. That would shew brave. Clean. This were the judgement seat, we now The heaviest crimes that ever made up Unnaturallness in humanity, You are found fowle and guilty by a Jury Made of your fathers curses, which have brought Vengeance impending on you, and I now Am forst to pronounce judgement on my judges. The common Lawes of reason and of nature Condemne you ipso facto, you are paricides, And if you marry will beget the lyar Who when y'are growne to full maturity Will hurry you their fathers to their graves; Like Traytors you take counsell from the living Of upright judgement, you would rob the Bench: Experience and discretion snatcht away From the earths face, turne all into disorder, Imprison vertue, and infranchice vice, And put the Sword of justice into the hands of Boyes and mad men. Sim. Well, well, have you done sir? Clean. I have spoke my thoughts. Sim. Then i'le begin and end. Duk. Tis time I now begin, Where your commission ends, Cleanthes you come from the Bar Because I know y'are severally disposd; I heere invite you to an object will no doubt Recorders. Worke in you contrary effects. Old men. Musick. Musick, Sons and the old men appeare. Clean. Pray Heaven I dream not, sure he moves, talkes comfortably, as joy can wish a man, if he be changd Far above from me, he is not ill intreated, His face doth promise fullness of content And glory hath a part int. Lea. Oh my son. Duk. You that can claime acquaintance with these lads Talke freely. Sim. I can see none there thats worth one hand to you from me. Duk. These are thy judges and by their grave Law I find thee cleare, but these Delinquents guilty: You must change places for tis so decreed Such just preheminence hath thy goodness gaind Thou art the judge now, they the men arraignd. 1. Cour. Heers fine dancing Gentlemen. 2. Cour. Is thy father amongst them? Clean. Oh a Pox I saw him the first thing I lookt on A live againe, slight I believe now a father Hath as many lives as a mother. Sim. Tis full as blessed as tis wonderfull Oh bring me back to the same law againe I am fowler then all these, cease on me Officers And bring me to new sentence. Clean. Whats all this? A fault not to be pardoned Unnaturallness is but suns shaddow to it. Sim. I am glad of that, I hope the case may alter And I turne judge againe. Duk. Name your offence. Clean. That I should be so vild As once to think you cruell. Duk. Is that all? 'Twas pardond ere confest, you that have sons If they be worthy heare my challenge then. Cle. I should have one amongst them had he had grace To have retaind that name. Sim. I pray you Father. Kneeles. Cle. That name I know Hath been long since forgot. Sim. I find but small comfort in remembring it now. Duk. Cleanthes take your places with these grave father And read what in that table is inscribed Now set these at the Bar, And read Cleanthes to the dread and terror Of disobedience and unnaturall blood. Clean. It is decreed by the grave and learned Counsell of Epire, that no son and heire Shall be held capable of his inheritance At the age of one and twenty, unlesse he be at that time As nature in obedience, manners and goodnesse. Sim. Sure I shall never be at full age then, Though I live to an hundred years, and thats nearer by twenty, Then the last Statute allowd. 1. Cour. A terrible act. Moreover is enacted that all sons aforesaid, whom either this Law or their owne grace, whom it shall reduce into the true method of duty, vertue, and affection; and relate their triall and approbation from Cleanthes the Son of Leonides—from me my Lord. Duk. From none but you as fullest, proceed sir. Clean. Whom for his manifest vertues, we make such judge and censure of youth and the absolute refferencs of life and manners. Sim. This is a brave world, when a man should be Selling Land he must be learning manners, Ist not my Masters? Eugenia. Enter Eugenia. Eug. Whats heere to do, my suitors at the Barr The old baud shines againe, oh miserable! She sounds. Duk. Read the Law over to her twill awake her Tis one deserves small pitty. Clean. Lastly it is ordained that all such wives now whatsoever that shall designe the husbands death to bee soone rid of them and entertaine suitors in their husbands life time. Sim. You had best read that a little lowder, For if any thing that will bring her to her selfe againe, and finde her tongue. Clean. Shall not presume on the penalty of our heavy displeasure to marry within ten years after. Eug. That Lawes too long by nine years and a halfe. I'le take my death upont, so shall most women. Clean. And those incontinent women so offending To be judge and censured by Hippolita, Wife to Cleanthes. Hippolita. Eug. Of all the rest i'le not be judge by her. Enter Hop. Clean. Ah heere shee comes, let mee prevent thy joyes, prevent them but in part and hide the rest, thou hast not strength enough to beare them else. Hip. Leonides. Shee faints. Clean. I feared it all this while. I knew 'twas past thy power Hippolita, What contrariety is in womens blood? One faints for spleene and anger, shee for grace. Duk. Of Sons and Wives we see the worst and best, My future ages yeeld Hippolitas Many, but few like thee Eugenia. Let no Simonides henceforth have a fame But all blest sons live in Cleanthes name Musick. Ha what strange kind of melody was that? Yet give it entrance whatsoere it be. Musick This day is all devout to liberty. Clo. &amp;c. Enter Musick one carrying a Bridecake, the Clowne, the rest with them old Women. Enter Clowne, and Wench, the rest with the old women, the Clownes wife, Musick, and a Bride Cake the wedding. Clo. Fidlers crowd on, crowd on, let no man lay a block in your way, crowd on I say. Duk. Stay the crowd a while, lets know the reason Of this jollity. Clean. Sirrah doe you know where you are? Clo. Yes sir, I am heere, now heere, and now heere agen sir. Lis. Your hats too high crownd the Duke in presence. Clo. The Duke (as hee is my Soveraigne) I doe give him two Crownes for it, and thats equall change all the world over, as am Lord of the day (being my marriage day the second) I doe advance bonnet crowd on a fore. Leon. Good sir a few words if you'l vouchsafe em Or will you be forc'd? Clo. Forc'd, I would the Duke himselfe would say so. Duk. I think he dares sir, and does, if you stay not You shall be forc'd. Clo. I thinke so my Lord, and good reason too, shall not I stay when your grace sayes I shall, I were unworthy to bee a Bridegroom in any part of your Highness Dominions then, will it please you to tast of the wedlock courtesie? Duke. Oh by no meanes sir, you shall not deface So faire an ornament for me. Clo. If your grace please to be cacated say so. Clo. And which might be your faire Bride sir? Clo. This is my two for one that must be uxor uxoris, The remedy doloris, and the very syceum Amoris. Duk. And hast thou any else? Clo. I have an older my Lord for other uses. Cle. My Lord I doe observe a strange decorum heere These that do lead this day of jollity Doe march with Musick and most mirthfull cheeks Those that doe follow sad, and wofully Nearer the havior of a funerall Then a wedding. Duk. Tis true, pray expound that sir. Clo. As the destiny of the day falls out my Lord, one goes out to wedding another goes to hanging; and your Grace in the due consideration shall finde em much alike, the one hath the ring upon her finger, the other a halter about her neck. I take thee Beatrice sayes the Bridegroome, I take thee Agatha sayes the hangman, and both say together to have and to hold till death do part us. Duk. This is not yet plaine enough to my understanding. Clo. If further your Grace examine it, you shall find I shew my selfe a dutifull subject and obedient to the Law, my selfe (with these my good friends, and your good subjects) our old wives whose daies are ripe, and their lives forfeit to the Law onely my selfe more forward then the rest, am already provided of my second choice. Duk. Oh take heede sir, you'l run your selfe into danger, If the Law finds you with two wives at once Theres a shrewd premunire. Clo. I have taken leave of the old my Lord, I have nothing to say to her, shees going to Sea, your Grace knowes whether better then I doe, shee has a strong wind with her, it stands full in her poope when you please let her disemboge. Cook. And the rest of her neighbours with her whom wee present to the satisfaction of your Highnes Law. Clo. And so wee take our leaves and leave them to your Highness, croud on. Duk. Stay, stay, you are too forward, will you marry? And your wife yet living. Clo. Alas Sheel bee dead before wee can get to Church, if your Grace would set her in the way, I would dispatch her, I have a venter ont, which would returne mee, if your Highnes would make a little more hast two for one. Duk. Come my Lords we must sit agen, heers a Case Craves a most serious censure. Cook. Now they shall be dispatcht out of the way. Clo. I would they were gone once, the time goes away. Duk. Which is the wife unto the forward Bridegroome? Wife. I am and it please your grace. Duk. Trust me a lusty woman, able bodied And well blooded cheeks. Clo. Oh she paints my Lord, she was a Chamber Maid once, and learnt it of her Lady. Duk. Sure I think she cannot be so old. Wife. Truly I think so too, and please your grace. Clo. Two to one with your grace of that, shees threescore by the Book. Leo. Peace sirra y'are to loud. Cook. Take heed Gnothoes if you moove the Dukes patience, tis an edge toole but a word and a blow, he cuts off your head. Clo. Cut off my head, away ignorant, hee knowes it cost more in the haire, he does not use to cut off many such heads as mine, I will talke to him to, it he cut off my head, ile give him my eares, I say my wife is at full age for the Law, the Clark shall take his oath and the Church Book shall be sworne too. Duk. My Lords, I leave this sensure to you Leo. Then first this fellow does deserve punishment For offering up a lusty able woman Which may do service to the commonwealth, Where the Law craves one impotent and useless. Creon, Therefore to be severely punished For thus attempting a second marriage His wife yet livinge. Lis. Nay to have it trebled That even the daye and instant when he should mourne As a kind husband to her funerall, Hee leads a triumph to the scorne of it Which unseasonable joy ought to bee punished With all severity. But. The fiddles will be in a foule case too by and by. Leo. Nay further it seemes hee has a venter Of two for one at his second marriage Which cannot be but a conspiracie Against the former. Clo. A messe of wise old men. Lis. Sirrah what can you answer to all these? Clo. Ye'are good old men and talke as age will give you leave; I would speake with the youthfull Duke himselfe, hee and I may speake of things that shall be 30 or 40 yeares after you are dead and rotten, alas you are heere to day and gone to Sea to morrow. Duk. Introath sir then I must be plaine with you The Law that should take away your old wife from you The which I doe perceive was your desire, Is voyd and frustrate, so for the rest, There has been since another Parliament Has cut it off. Clo. I see your grace is disposd to be pleasant. Duk. Yes you might perceive that, I had not else Thus dallied with your follies. Clo. Ile talke further with your grace when I come Back from Church, in the meane time you know what to doe With the old women. Duk. Stay sir unlesse in the mean time you mean I cause a sibber to be set up in your way and hang you at your return. Wife. Oh gratious Prince. Duk. Your old wives cannot die to day by any Law of mine, for ought I can say too em They may by a new edict bury you, And then perhaps you pay a new fine too. Clo. This is fine indeed. Wife. Oh Gracious Prince may he live a hundred years more. Cook. Your venture is not like to come in to day Gnothoes. Clo. Give me the principall back. Cook. Nay by my troath weel venter still, and i'me sure wee have as ill a venter of it as you, for wee have taken old wives of purpose, where that we had thought to have put away at this market, and now we cannot utter a pennyworth. Duke. Well sirrah you were best to discharge Your new charge and take your old one to you. Clo. Oh Musick, no musick, but prove most dolefull Trumpets, Oh Bride no Bride, but thou maist prove a Strumpet, Oh venter, no venter, I have for one now none, Oh wife, thy life is sav'd when I hope t'had been gone, Case up your fruitless strings. no penny no wedding, Case up thy Maiden head, no Priest no bedding. Avant my venter it can nere be restord, Till Agg my old wife be thrown over board, Then come agen old Agg since it must be so, Let Bride, and venter with wofull Musick goe. Cook. What for the Bridecake Gnothoes? Clo. Let it be mouldy now tis out of season, Let it grow out of date currant and reason, Let it be chip'd and chopt and given to chickens. No more is got by that, then William Dickins Got by his wooden dishes. Put up your plums as fidlers put up pipes, The Wedding dasht the Bridegroome Weeps and wipes. Fidlers farwell and now without perhaps, Put up your Fiddles as you put up scraps. Lis. This passion has given some satisfaction yet, My Lord I think you'l pardon him now, Withall the rest so they live honestly With the wives they have. Duke. Oh most freely, free pardon to all. Cook. I wee have deserv'd our pardons if wee can live honestly with such reverent wives that have no motion in em but their tongues. Wife. Heaven blesse your Grace, y'are a just Prince. Clo. All hopes dash'd, the Clarks duties lost, Venter gon, my second wife divorc'd, and which is worst the old one come back agen. Such Voyages are made now adayes, I will weep too salt Of our nose, besides these two fountaines of fresh water, Your grace had been more kind to your yong subjects, Heaven blesse, and mend your Lawes, that they do Not gull your poore Country men: fashion, but I am not The first by forty that has been undone by the Law, Tis but a folly to stand upon Termes, I take my leave of your Grace, as well as mine eyes will give me leave, I would they had been a sleep in their beds when they opend em to see this day: come Agg, come Agg. Creon. Were not you all my servants? Cook. During your life as we thought sir, but our yong Master turnd us away. Creon. How headlong villaine wert thou in thy ruine? Sim. I followed the fashion sir as other yong men did, If you have as we thought you had been We should nere have come for this I warrant you, We did not feed after the old fashion on Beefe And Mutton and such like. Creon. Well what dammage or charge you have run Your selves into by marriage, I cannot help Nor deliver you from your wives, them you must keepe Your selves shall againe retaine to me. Om. We thank your Lordship for your love, and must thanke our selves for our bad bargains. Duk. Cleanthes You delay the power of Law, To be inflicted on these misgovernd men, That filiall duty have so far transgrest. Clean. My Lord I see a satisfaction Meeting the sentence, even preventing it Beating my words back in their utterance See sir theres salt sorrow bringing forth fresh And new duties (as the sea propagate) The Elephants have found their joynts too, why Heres humility able to bind up The punishing hands of the severest masters Much more the gentle fathers. Sim. I had nere thought to have been brought so low as my knees agen, but since thers no remedy, fathers, reverent fathers, as you ever hope to have good sons and heirs, a handfull of pitty wee confesse wee have deservd more then wee are willing to receive at your hands, though sonnes can never deserve too much of their fathers as shall appeare afterwards. Creon. And what way can you decline your feeding now? You cannot retire to Beeves and Muttons sure. Sim. Alas sir you see a good pattern for that, now we have laid by our high and lusty meats, and are downe to our mary bones allready. Creon. Well sir rise to vertues weel bound you now, You that were too weake your selves to govern, By others shall be governd. Lis. Cleanthes. I meet your Justice with reconcilement If there be tears of faith in womans brest I have receivd a mirriade which confirmes me To finde a happy renovation. Clean. Heers Virtues Throne Which i'le imbellish with my dearest Jewels Of Love and Faith, Peace and Affection, This is the Altar of my Sacrifice, Where dayly my devoted knees shall bend Age honored shrine, time still so love you, That I so long may have you in mine eye Untill my memory lose your beginning. For you great Prince, long may your fame survive, Your justice and your wisdome never die, Crowne of your Crowne, the blessing of your Land Which you reach to her from your regents hand. Leon. Oh Cleanthes had you with us tasted The entertainment of our retirement Feard and exclaimd on in your ignorance, You might have sooner died upon the wonder Then any rage or passion for our losse. A place at hand we were all strangers in So spheard about with Musik, such delights Viands and attendance, and once a day So cheared with a royall visitant That oft times (waking) our unsteady phantasies Would question whether we yet livd or no Or had possession of that Paradice Where Angells be the guard. Duk. Enough Leonides You go beyond the prayse, we have our end And all is ended well, we have now seene The flowers and weeds that grew about our Court. Sim. If these be weeds i'me afraid I shall weare none so good agen as long as my father lives. Duke. Only this Gentleman we did abuse With our owne bosome, we seemd a Tyrant And he our instrument, looke tis Cratilus. Discover the Executioner. The man that you suppos'd had now been traveld, Which wee gave leave to learn to speak And bring us forraigne languages to Greece Alls joyed I see, let Musick be the Crowne, And set it high, the good needs feare no Law, It is his safety, and the bad mans aw.
