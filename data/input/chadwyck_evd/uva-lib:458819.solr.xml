      <field name="fulltext">THE MASQUE OF OWLES AT KENELWORTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Presented by the Ghost of Captaine Coxe mounted in his Hoby-horse. 1626. Cap. Coxe. Roome, roome, for my Horse will wince, If he come within so many yards of a Prince, And though he have not on his wings, He will doe strange things. He is the Pegasus that uses To waite on Warwick Muses; And on gaudy-dayes he paces Before the Coventrie Graces; For to tell you true, and in rime, He was foald in Q. Elizabeths time, When the great Earle of Lester In this Castle did feast her. Now, I am not so stupid To thinke, you thinke me a Cupid; Or a Mercurie, that sit him: Though these Cocks here would fit him. But a spirit very civill, Neither Poets God, nor Devill, An old Kenelworth Fox, The Ghost of Captaine Cox, For which I am the bolder, To weare a Cock on each shoulder. This Captaine Cox, by St. Mary, Was at Bullen with King Hary; And (if some doe not vary) Had a goodly library, By which he was discerned To be one of the learned To entertaine the Queene here, When last she was seene here. And for the Towne of Coventrie To act to her soveraigntie. But so his lot fell out, That serving then afoot, And being a little man; When the skirmish began 'Twixt the Saxon, and the Dane, (For thence the storie was tane) Hee was not so well seene As he would have beene o'the Queene. Though this sword were twice so long As any mans else in the throng And for his sake, the Play Was call'd for the second day. But he made a vow (And he performes it now) That were he alive, or dead, Hereafter, it should never be sed But Cap. Cox would serve on horse For better or for worse, If any Prince came hither. And his horse should have a feather Nay, such a Prince it might be Perhaps he should have three. Now, Sir (in your approach The rumbling of your Coach Awaking me, (his Ghost) I come to play your Host; And feast your eyes and eares, Neither with Dogs, nor Beares, Though that have beene a fit Of our maine-shire wit, In times heretofore, But now, we have got a little more. These then that we present With a most loyall intent And (as the Author saith) No ill meaning to the Catholique faith, Are not so much beasts, as Fowles, But a very Nest of Owles, And naturall, so thrive I, I found them in the Ivy, A thing, that though I blundred at, It may in time be wondred at, If the place but affords Any store of lucky birds, As I make'em to flush Each Owle out of his bush. Now, these Owles (some say) were men, And they may be soagen, If once they endure the light Of your highnesse sight: For Bank-rupts, we have knowne Rise to more then their owne. With a little-little savour Of the Princes favour, But, as you like their tricks, I'le spring 'em, they are but six. Hey, Owle first. This Bird is London bred As you may see by his horn'd head. And had like to have beene tane At his shop in Ivy-lane, Where he sold by the peney Tobacco, as good as any; But, whether it did provoke His conscience, he sold smoke; Or some other toy he tooke, Towards his calling to looke: He fled by Moone-shine thence; And broke for sixteene pence. Hey, Owle second. This too, the more is the pittie Is of the breed, of the same Citie, A true Owle of London That gives out he is undone, Being a Cheese-monger, By trusting two of the younger Captaines, for the hunger Of their halfe-staru'd number; Whom since they have shipt away: And left him God to pay, With those eares for a badge Of their dealing with his Madge. Hey, Owle third. A pure native Bird This, and though his hue Be not Coventrie-blue, Yet is he undone By the thred he has spunne, For since the wise towne Has let the sports downe Of May-games, and Morris, For which he right sorry is: Where their Maides, and their Makes, At dancings, and Wakes, Had their Napkins, and poses, And the wipers for their noses. And their smocks, all-be-wrought With his thred which they bought, It now lies on his hands, And having neither wit, nor lands, Is ready to hang, or choke him, In a skeyne of that, that broke him. Hey, Owle fourth. Was once a Bankrupt of worth; And having run a shifting race At last by money, and grace, Got him a Serjeants place, And to be one of Chace. A full fortnight was not spent, But out comes the Parliament, Takes away the use of his Mace, And left him in a worse, then his first case. Hey, Owle the fift. But here was a defeat, Never any so great, Of a Don, a Spanish Reader, Who had thought to have bin the Leader (Had the Match gon on) Of our Ladyes one by one, And triumpht our whole Nation, In his Rodomant fashion: But now since the breach, He has not a Scholler to teach. Hey, Owle sixt. The Bird-bringer up is a Knight, But a passionate wight, Who, since the Act against swearing, (The tale's worth your hearing) In this short times growth Hath at twelve pence an oath; For that (I take it) is the rate Sworne himselfe out of his estate. The third varied. A Crop-eard Scrivener, this, Who when he heard but the whis- per of moneys to come downe, Fright got him out of Towne With all the Bills and Bands Of other mens in his hands, And cry'd, who will drive the trade, Since such a Law they had made: It was not he that broke. Two i'the hundred spoke. Nor car'd he for the curse, He could not heare much worse, He had his eares in his purse. The End.</field>
