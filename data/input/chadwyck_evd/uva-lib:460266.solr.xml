      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by Mr. Dennis. This Play's no English product, but with toil, Imported from a richer nobler Soil. Then judge not rashly what, in better times, Great Tasso's Genius writ to warmer climes. They, who like Nature, may suppose it good, Tho Nature but by few is understood; She never is but by reflection seen, And few are bold enough to look within. As when a thoughtful man forsakes the Town, And to some Country Solitude goes down, With more than common pleasure he beholds The Woods, the Lawns, the Valleys, and the Folds Natures bright Beauties every where he meets, His Soul, which long had been confin'd in streets, With Rapture now her kindred objects greets. These rural Scenes like pleasure may impart To those who value Nature more than Art, And who have Souls to taste the Language of the Heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Our Author was afraid to have his Cause Come before Judges who dispence with Laws. For those he sees, are always kind to Fools, But most severe to such as write by Rules. They hate ev'n Nature too as much as Art, And nothing but what's monstrous will divert. Those Plays alone, that make 'em Laugh, delight, Where folly oft succeeds as well as Wit. So merry in their humours, we can scarce Engage 'em now with any thing but Farce. What hopes then that our serious Scenes will do? They'll hardly spare 'em for their being new; Their Novelty perhaps will give offence, But above all we dread their Innocence; Unless the Fair in their defence appear, From whom, we hope, we have the least to fear: Love, Pity, Innocence, of right belong To those to judge of, who inspir'd the Song. And if some persons fancy Farces best Because their own dear Pictures make the Jest; The fair have much more reason to esteem The beauteous Images we draw from them. To them the Soveraign Arbiters of Wit, Our Author only would his Cause submit, Whate're their censures are, he'll not presume To think 'em hard, nor murmur at his doom. As for the Criticks, tho he cannot trust That they'll be either merciful or just, Yet if this Play is by the Ladies lik'd, He thinks they're too well bred to contradict.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Daphne, Sylvia. Daphne. Sylvia, will you still persist In this strange disgust of Love? Will you still refuse to hear Our Shepherds sighs, and scorn their tears? But if sighs and tears in vain Attempt to move your cruel heart, Methinks the hopes that you might have To see a lovely Infant smile, And call you Mother, should succeed: Change, foolish Creature, change your thoughts, And be not constant to a Crime. Sylvia. Let others, if they please, be mov'd With sighs and tears, and take delight To play with Love: I'll never quit The Forests, never leave the Chace, Whilst Beasts of prey are to be found. I'll range the Woods, I'll scour the Plains, And with my Bow and Quiver find A better way to nobler sport. Daphne. Dull sport, and an insipid life! You Sylvia, stubborn as thou art, Will think so too, when you begin To taste the sweets of Love. âSo the first people, who possest âIn Innocence the Infant World, âFed on Acorns, and when dry âDrank the Waters of the Brook: âBeasts only now on Acorns feed, âAnd drink the Waters of the Brook: âAnd thus when you at last shall feel âHow pleasant 'tis beneath a shade, âTo sit and talk with one you love: Then, Sylvia, you'll repent and cry, Ah, fool! I never lov'd till now. You'll throw away your Arrows, break your Bow, And curse the minutes you have lost. Change, foolish Creature change your thoughts, And be not constant to a Crime. Sylvia. When I sit and talk of Love, Dogs shall be afraid of Hares, Wolves of Lambs, and Streams return To the Fountains whence they rose; Bears shall then the Forests leave, And Dolphins dance about the Plains. Daphne. I know your pride, for I was once Wild and obstinate, like you. âI was then as fair, my Locks âAs white as yours, my Lips as red: âSuch Roses and such Lillies grac'd âMy Cheeks, as flourish now on yours. â'Twas then (so stupid was my taste) âThe darling pleasure of my life, âTo set my Lime-twigs, lay my Nets, âAnd laugh as often as I saw âThe Birds entangled in my Snares. I then delighted in the Chace, And scorn'd, with savage modesty, The Shepherds whom my Charms had conquer'd: I was then so far unjust, As once to think it cause enough To hate 'em for their loving me; And pleasing them displeas'd my self: But oh! what will not time effect; What will not services and sighs, Desert, entreaties, truth and tears? What, Sylvia, will not all these do? Sylvia, Nothing with a mind resolv'd Against their flatteries, like mine. Daphne. Mistaken Maid! They'll master every stubborn thought, And force our hearts to think of Love. I know it by my self, for I have felt, And must confess their power. They tempted me to tear my Nets, Neglect my Lime-twigs, break my Bow, And fling my Arrows in the Air. I cry'd there, there, Diana, take These useless Weapons, I renounce The Woods and all thy sports for Love. Sylvia. Renounce 'em by your self and as for meâ Daphne. Who knows, Amintas may in time Convert even thee to do as much: Is he not handsom? Can you see A comelier youth in all the plain? If you're related to the Gods. Amintas is deriv'd from Pan: You oft have Amarillis seen, And in some Fountain may compare Her beauties with your own. The difference, Sylvia, is not great, Yet poor Amintas shuns her smiles, To follow your contempt and you; And for your hate despises Love. But think it may not still be thus, Think when her Beauties or her smiles Have toucht his heart, they'll laugh at yours, And make a jest of thy disdain. Sylv. Where e're he pleases let him love, And Court what Maid he will but me: I'll ne're be troubled with his heart, Nor give him any hopes of mine. Daphne. What makes you hate him thus? Sylv. His love. Daphne. âAh cruelty! we might expect âThat Ravens would be born of Swans, âOf Tygers Lambs, as well as thou âFrom tender Parents be deriv'd. Sylv. I hate his Love because he hates What I love most, a Maiden life. While friendship only warm'd his Soul, None could esteem him more than I. Dap. You'd have him then confine his wishes, To as narrow bounds as yours, He less deserves to be condemn'd For wishing much, Than you do for not wishing more. Syl. Daphne, Peace, or if you'll talk, Prithee talk of something else. Dap. Suppose another Swain should court ye, Would you, Sylvia use him thus. Syl. Thus every one that dares attempt To interrupt me in my sports; And he that talks of Love to me, I'll use him as he is, my Foe. Dap. You may, Sylvia, then suppose Turtles to their Mates are foes. When the Birds begin to sing, You may think they hate the Spring: You may, if you please, suppose, Nature and the Spring are foes, That its pregnant heats create Flowers, Plants, and Fruit in hate. But if you observe, you find Every thing to Love inclin'd Doves in gentle whispers woe Their tender Mates, and bill and coe. The Nightingale flies round the Grove, And sings on every Bough I love. Beasts by nature fierce and wild, Become, when Love commands 'em, mild. The Lyon, Wolf, the Tyger, Bear, Less cruel, Sylvia, than you are, In Savage murmurs Love declare. E'en Trees their amorous branches join, The Ivy fondly clasps the Vine, And her kind embraces shew, What you to Love and Nature owe. Change, foolish Creature, change your thoughts, And be not constant to a Crime. Syl. If Beasts, if Trees, or Ivy shew, What Love and Nature bid me do, I'll tarry till they tell me so. Dap. You mock me, Sylvia, have a care How you make a jest of Love. The time will come when you'll repent, For laughing at my Counsel now. When wrinkles shrivel up your brow: When the clear Fountains you will shun, Where now you take too much delight, To view your Beauties; where you gaze Whole hours with pleasure on that face, Which then you'll be afraid to see. Then, Sylvia, you'll repent in vain You did not follow my advice. Have you forgot, or never heard What wise Elpinus told the fair, The cruel Lycoris, whose eyes Are not more charming than his voice? Have you forgot it, Sylvia? Sylvia. I know not what you mean. Daph. 'Tis strange: 'Twas in Aurora's awful Cave, âO're whose mouth are writ these words, âHence, hence, O ye Profane! Battus and Thyrsis being by, He told her what he learnt from him, Who sung so well of War and Love, And left him when he dy'd, his Pipe; That there's a place among the damn'd, Where all ungrateful Beauties live, Tormented with eternal fires: The Gods being careful to revenge Their Lovers wrongs; and 'tis but just That pain should melt 'em into tears, Since pity could not touch their hearts. âThink, think on this, and if you dare, âPersist, O Fool, in thy disdain. Sylvia. âAnd what said Lycoris to this? Daph. âYou're fond to know anothers thoughts, âBut will not change your own. She seem'd âConvinc'd, and answer'd with her eyes. Syl. âWhat? answer with her Eyes! Pray tell me how. Daph. âShe smil'd, and turning to the Swain, âIn her kind looks she seem'd to say, âI'm conquer'd; take the heart you begg'd, âYou cannot wish for more. âShe seem'd to say it, and 'thad been enough, âIf men might venture to believe, âOr trust the Language of the eyes. Syl. âWhy did he not believe it? Daph. âHave you not read what Thyrsis wrote? âIn yonder Wood, where sorrow led âHis wandering steps? The Nymphs and Swains âLaught at, and pity'd him, to see âThe foolish things he often did, âIn many of his amorous fits: âYet foolish as his actions seem'd, âHis words were sensible; and none âHave cause to laugh at what he wrote. âDeceitful Glass, where oft I see âFalse glances to deceive me, âThe Heart must with the Eyes agree, âOr they will ne're relieve me. âWhen dying Looks and smiles I meet, âI'm still afraid of Treason, âBut Love, to help 'em in the Cheat, âDeprives me of my Reason. âHe Grav'd 'em on a thousand Trees; âAnd Nature, careful of his sense, âPreserves his Verses free from storms, âAnd makes 'em flourish in the Bark. Syl. Daphne, we fool away the day In idle talk; 'tis time for me To be provided for my Sport. First then I'll to the lonely Brook, Which glides thro yon delicious Wood, And bath me in the Crystal stream; There playing with the waves a while, I grow refresh'd, and with new life, Rise from the Waters to the Chace. Daph. 'Tis early, I must first go home, I'll meet you after at the Brook, And bath me with you, if you please. But, Sylvia, think on what I've said, Tis of more consequence than Brooks, Or Dogs, or Forests, or your Game; And if you know not yet what 'tis To love, ah! learn of those that do: Love of all pleasures is the best, And none can be without it blest. Exeunt. SCENE II. Amintas, Thyrsis. Amin. I've often found that Rocks and Waves Have answer'd my complaint: But oh! I never found, nor hope to find The Nymph, whom I've so long ador'd, As gentle ev'n as Rocks and Waves. Is she a Woman? One may well suspect If she's of humane race, and yet I see Her beautiful and young, her form Of such a mould, so soft, so sweet, That 'twere impossible to think It lodg'd a Soul averse to Love. If to my cost I had not found That things inanimate are less Insensible of pity than her heart. Thyrsis. Lambs feed on Grass, and Wolves on Lambs, They're satisfy'd in time; but Love, Who feeds on Tears, is never satisfy'd. Amin. If Tears cou'd glut his appetite, He had been surfeited e're this: Or if the Virgin cou'd be mov'd With Seas of Tears I had been blest: No, they both hunger after Blood, And I resolve to give 'em mine. Thyr. âAh! why, Amintas, will you talk âOf Blood? If she is so severe, âAre there not other Maids as young, âAs fair as she? Look out and try, âAnother Beauty may be kind. Amint. âWhere shall I look, or how expect to find? âA Maid to please me, when I've lost my self. Thyr. Don't flatter your despair, but hope This cruel fair may yield at last: Lyons and Tygers may be tam'd, And she you Love with Love be overcome. Amin. But who so wretched, who so near To death as I am, can be pleas'd With Life, or bear the torment long? Thyr. The torment will not be so long As you suspect, for Womens minds Are movable, like Aspin leaves; And what they may this minute hate, They'll love the next. But say, my friend, Where lives? and who's this haughty Maid, That treats Amintas with such scorn? You've told me often that you love, But never told me whom: be free, And open all your heart, without reserve. Amin. Well, you shall hear what every Wood, What all our Hills and Streams have heard, But no Man ever knew before; 'Tis fit now I'm so near the Grave, Some friend should know the fatal cause, And write my sorrows on the Tomb, Where my pale body shall be laid, That every passenger may read My fate, and she for whom I dye Be pleas'd to triumph o're my dust: It may be when she sees how far Despair has carry'd me, the thought (And yet I fear I hope too much) Will fetch a sigh, or force a tear; And make her pity me, and wish That poor Amintas were alive. Hear thenâ Thyr. I hearken: and perhaps For better ends than you suppose. Amin. While I was yet a little Boy, Scarce tall enough to reach a Bough, Or pluck an Apple from a Tree, I felt my heart engag'd to love The fairest Creature ever liv'd; Sylvia, the glory of the Woods, Montano's and Cydippe's Daughter: Sylvia, whose beauty, mien and youth, Charm every heart as well as mine; Our Houses joyn'd, but were not half So close united as our Hearts: Two Friends ne're lov'd as we did then; Two Turtles ne're so fondly sought Each others company, as we did; Our pleasures with our years agreed, The same diversions suited both; We sometimes Hunted, sometimes Fish'd, Sometimes we laid our Nets for Birds, And always shar'd the Game we caught. But while we pleasantly pursu'd Our mutual sports, alas! I felt Strange wishes growing in my heart: Like Flow'rs that on a sudden spring From beds where they were never set: Whene're we parted now I wept For grief, and when we met, for joy. I suckt in poison from her eyes, Which seem'd delicious to the taste, But left a bitter smart behind. I saw her now with new delight; I found new Graces in her face; I often sigh'd, but knew not why; I lov'd, but did not know 'twas love, Till chance discover'd it. Thyr. Pray how? Amin. Sylvia, Phillis, and my self, Sitting underneath a Shade, Saw a Bee fly round the bank, Gathering Honey from the Flow'rs Which adorn'd our happy seat: Weary'd there, he fled to us, Pitcht on Phillis, who has Cheeks Fairer, sweeter than the Rose, Fancying every Grace a Flow'r, There he hung a while, and suckt Sweets much richer than his own! Phillis wept to feel the smart; Sylvia bid her weep no more, I, she crys, can say a Charm, That will quickly give you ease: 'Tis a Secret which I learnt Of wise Aricia, to whom For her Art I gave my Horn, Tipt with Ivory and Gold. Then she put her fragrant Lips To the Cheek the Bee had stung, Said some Verses o're the Wound, And as soon as Sylvia spoke, Phillis felt the pain no more. See the wonderful effects, See the force of Magic words, Or, what I would rather think, See what Sylvia's Lips can do, Every thing they touch they heal. Thyr. How, Amintas, could you find Love had wounded you by this? Amin. I till this desir'd no more Than to see her radiant Eyes, Or to listen to her Voice, Soft as Rivulets that glide Murmuring thro our smiling Vales; Soft as Zephyr's evening breath, Playing with the Leaves of Trees: But as soon as I observ'd What her Lips had lately done, Then I wish'd 'em close to mine, And, I know not how, contriv'd Ways to taste of what I wish'd. Thyr. None want artifice to gain What they covet to possess; All are cunning when in love. Amin. I, to touch her rosy mouth, Feign'd a Bee had stung me too; And complain'd with such an air, That it seem'd to beg the Cure, Which my tongue cou'd ne'r have askt. Sylvia kindly did to me What she had to Phillis done, And her Lips thus fix'd to mine, Cur'd the counterfeited smart, But encreast my real pain. Bees sure never from their Flow'rs Drew such Honey as I suckt From my Sylvia's humid kisses. Sure no Roses but what grow On her Lips can yield such sweets. Tho my pleasure was disturb'd By my shame, and guilty fears: Yet I counterfeited still, And by this deceit prevail'd O're her to repeat the Charm. Something sweet from ev'ry kiss, Mixt with poyson, struck my heart; Which at last grew so inflam'd, That when once we met to play, With some other Nymphs and Swains, I, just dying with my fears, Softly whisper'd her, I Love. Thyr. How did Sylvia take the news? That you seem so much concern'd. Amin. Soon her fiery blushes shew'd Both her anger and her shame; She stood silent, but I read By her silence what she meant, That she never wou'd forgive me. Now she flies me, and will since Not so much as hear me speak. Thrice our Golden Fields have bent Under their rich loads, and thrice Winter has with nipping frosts Made our Groves and Forests bare, Since I've try'd a thousand ways To appease her, but I find Death can only calm her rage. Death shall calm her then, my blood Shall appease her for my fault. I cou'd dye, methinks, with joy, Were I sure my Death would make her Either sorrowful or glad; And I know not which to wish: Yes, her Pity would reward All my sufferings, and shew What my Constancy deserv'd. Yet, ah! why should I desire That her beauteous Eyes should weep, Or her Rest be lost for me? Thyr. Oh! could she hear such killing words, Such just complaints, 'twould melt her heart, And make her pity ye. Amin. I fear it. But were she sensible of pity, She flies, and will not hear me speak: What hopes then that my just complaints Will melt her heart, that must not reach her ear? Thyr. Cease, cease your grief, I'll plead your Cause, Perhaps my Reasons may succeed, And something promises they will, If you would not despair. Amin. âI've reason to despair for ever, âSage Mopsus has foretold my fate: âMopsus, who understands so well âThe virtues of all Herbs and Drugs; âWho by long study has acquir'd âTo know things past, and things to come; âMopsus has said, I must despair. Thyr. âWhich Mopsus? He who speaks so fair? âAnd with grave smiles declares events: âDark and treacherous to deceive âSuch as suppose his Oracles divine. âHe tells them, with a solemn look, âThings that will never come to pass, âHis Prophecies prove always lies. âBelieve me, for I know him false. âBe chearful, you have cause enough âTo hope your fortune will be good, âSince Mopsus has pronounc'd it ill. Amin. âTell me, if you'd revive my hopes, âWhat makes you, Thyrsis, think him false? Thyr. âWhen I first settled in these Plains, I lov'd âLike you, to hear him talk, and thought his words âAs wise as they were grave, but quickly found âMopsus a Cheat, and what he talks of, Lyes. âFor once, when I resolv'd to go and see âThe famous City which adorns the banks âOf our great River, and by that's adorn'd, âI told him my intentions, as a friend, âAnd thus the envious Hypocrite reply'd, âYou know not, Thyrsis, what you have resolv'd, âNor the vast danger you're about to run; âFor Treason reigns within her Marble walls, âWhere nothing kind or honest's to be found, âAnd ev'n the name of friendship is unknown: âHer Citizens grow wealthy by deceit, âBy treachery her Courtiers grow renown'd; âOn Downy Beds, and under Gilded Roofs, âBoth seem to sleep, yet both are kept awake, âBy plotting death and ruin for the weak. âA thousand horrid Fiends, in various shapes, âStalk thro her streets, all ready to destroy âSuch innocent and easie fools as you. âThere you will hear 'em laugh at your rude mien, âDespise a Shepherds life, and mock our Songs. âBut above all, her shining Palace fly, âLet nothing tempt you to approach her Gates. Amin. âAnd what could he suggest, to have you shun âSo rich a sight, which I should long to see? Thyr. âHe told me, all things were Enchanted there; âThat the pretended Diamonds were but Glass, âAnd all their Golden Vessels real Brass: âThat empty bags her massy Coffers fill'd: âAnd her high Walls were rais'd up with such art, âThat they can hear and answer what is said: âAs Eccho answers in these Woods to us, âThis difference only, that they sometimes speak âWhat they ne'r heard, which Eccho never does. âThat every thing you meet there has a Tongue, âThus prepossest by him, I went to Court, âBut soon was undeceiv'd by Glorious Quires âOf Heavenly Virgins, who like Syrens sung; âTheir voices sweeter, but not half so false. âCharm'd with their notes, a while I stood amaz'd, âTill a great Prince, magnificently drest, âHis air majestick, and his mien sublime; âA Prince, Amintas, destin'd by the Gods âTo vanquish Tyrants, and secure us Peace, âInvited me, as rude as I appear'd, âTo see the Glories which adorn'd his Court. âI enter'd then, but never can relate âThe Miracles I saw: a thousand Suns âShot forth bright Rays, and lookt as they were warm: âI saw young Goddesses in all her Rooms: âBut met with one so eminently fair, âHer mien so graceful, and her looks so sweet, âThat 'tis not strange if I could be deceiv'd, âAnd fancy'd that she was the Queen of Heaven. âI saw the Muses painted with their God, âOur Sage Elpinus sitting pensive by: âAnd from that minute felt a noble fire âRage in my breast, and I resolv'd to sing âOf War, and scorn the dying notes of Love: âTho since, to please another, I'm oblig'd âTo quit the City, and return to you: âYet my Pipe still preserves her Courtly note, âLike the loud Trumpet in our Forests sounds; âMopsus has listen'd, and admires with shame, âTo hear such Musick eccho from our Woods; âAsham'd to find that I have prov'd him false, âAnd seen so much, and learnt to sing so well. âWill ye believe still? Amin. âI'm glad to hear âWe have such reason to mistrust his words âOn your success my happiness depends. Thyr. âDepend on my success and have a care, âThe nearest way to ruin's to despair. CHORUS. Ah! the Golden Age is past, Which our happy Fathers blest; When whate're they long'd to taste, They but wisht for, and possest. The Meads were painted still with Flow'rs, The Birds ne'r ceas'd to sing; And then, without the help of show'rs, They saw eternal Spring. Rivers then with Milk were fill'd, Honey from their Woods distill'd; None attempted then the Main, Nor expos'd their Lives for gain: Free from danger, want or care; Free from tumult, noise and war: They a thousand Joys possest, Peace and Plenty were the least. Ah! the Golden, &amp;c. âHonour, whose Laws are so severe, âSo hard to be obey'd; âWho reigns with so much rigor here, âNe're o're their pleasures sway'd. âThe only maxim which they knew âThey were by Nature taught, âThat what they had a mind to do, âThey might, without a fau't. âThe Virgin never blush'd to shew âBy day her naked Charms; âAnd when she lov'd a Swain, would go âWith freedom to his arms. âBy Woods, on Greens they danc'd and play'd, âIn Fountains kist and toy'd; âThe youth then boldly took his Maid, âAnd what he lik'd enjoy'd. âBut now when men the blessing want, âThey long must court the fair in vain; âFor Honor will not let 'em grant âThe pleasure they deny with pain. â'Twas honour that first swell'd their hearts, âThat taught 'em shame, and to be coy; âTo frown, and use those little arts, âWhich only cheat 'em of their joy. âHence thou Idol Honour, hence; âLeave us to our humble sports; âReign in Cities and in Courts; âHonor is the child of Pride: âHere let Nature be our Guide: âHence thou Idol Honour, hence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Daphne, Thyrsis. Daph. I knew long since Amintas lov'd The haughty Sylvia, and Heaven knows Have oft endeavour'd to dispose Her heart to be as much concern'd As he deserves, and I could wish: But all that I can say's in vain, For Bears and Tygers may be tam'd Sooner than such a simple Maid, As proud and silly as she's fair: Who, ignorant of what she does, Or that her Eyes are arm'd with death, Commits new Murders every hour And kills when she has no design to wound. Thyr. Where, Daphne, can you find a Maid So weak, so innocent, so young, As to be ign'rant of her Charms? They early deck themselves with smiles, They know the wounds their Eyes have made, They know too what will cure those wounds, And raise their Slaves from misery to bliss. Daphne. Who teaches 'em all this? Thyr. The same That teaches Nightingales to sing, The Peacock how to spread his Plumes, That teaches Bulls to use their Horns, The Ram to push, and Fish to swim: Nature instructs em what to do, Without the Mother or the Nurses help. Daphne. Nay Thyrsis, now I plainly see Thou'rt both malicious and a fool; But to speak truth, I don't believe That Sylvia is as ignorant As she pretends; for t'other day I found her in the little Isle That stands in yonder, spacious Meads, Encompast with a Crystal Lake; In whose clear Waters she beheld Her Beauties; ravish'd with the sight, She seem'd to ask 'em how to place Her hair, and put her Garland on; She often with her Cheeks compar'd A Rose, and Lillies with her Neck; On Rose and Lilly then she look'd With scorn, as if she said, O Flow'rs, Yield, yield to me; I wear ye now That you may blush to be outdone, And not for ornament, for see I've better Graces of my own. While thus she with the Waters play'd She look'd around, and spy'd me out, She drest herself in haste, and dropt Her Flow'rs, asham'd to be perceiv'd. I laugh'd aloud, and she I saw Was more asham'd to see me laugh: Yet did not dress her in such haste, But to the Fountain once or twice She ran, to see her hair was set In order, and with pleasure saw Those locks in sweet confusion flow, Which haste had forc'd her to neglect: I look'd and laugh'd, and said no more. Thyr. I ever did believe as much, Tho I could never prove it true. Daph. I've heard that once the Nymphs and Swains Scorn'd to adorn themselves by art; Nor was it thus when I was young, But now alas! the world grows old, And older as it grows, decays. Thyr. The Citizens then seldom came To us, the Shepherds seldom went To them; but all things now are chang'd: We learn their manners, and forget Our Customs, by observing theirs. This, Daphne, is not our concern; D'ye think that Sylvia ne're will let Amintas talk with her alone, Or when you only shall be by? Daph. I can't tell, She's extremely proud. Thyr. And he respectful to extreams. Daph. Respect in Lovers is a Vice; You, who are his friend, should tell him, That to succeed he must be bold; Sollicit, sue, entreat, demand: And if this method may not take, Seize on the blessing he defires. Don't you know, Thyrsis, womens tricks? They only fly to be pursu'd, Refuse what they would have ye take; And fight that you may overcome. I tell you freely all our faults, And beg they may not be expos'd. Thyrsis. You need not fear that I will speak More than you would have me say; But I conjure thee by the thoughts, The pleasing thoughts of thy past youth, That you'll assist Amintas in his Love, And save the wretch from death. Daph. By my past youth, the only thing Which if I could I would forget, Yet this you now conjure me by: Well, what is't you would have me do? Thyr. You want no counsel, you can tell As well as I what must be done To save him, if you're so dispos'd. Daph. Sylvia and my self anon Are to bath us in the Brook Which is from Diana call'd; Where the Nymphs that love the Chace Play beneath the Plantain shade, In the fiercest heats of noon: There I tell you Sylvia baths, And leaves naked all her Charms. Thyr. What then? Daph. What then? Why thou'rt a fool, Can't you guess my meaning then? Thyr. I guess your meaning, tho I fear Amintas will not dare to do't. Daph. Not dare! then truly he may stay Till she seeks him. Thyr. 'Twill be no more Than he deserves. Daph. âEnough of this: âLet's now talk something of your self; âD'ye never, Thyrsis, think of Love? âIf I remember well your age, âYou're not much older yet than he; âThis is the season of desire: âMethinks you should not waste your youth âIn idleness, but long to taste âWhat 'tis to Love, âFor that's the only comfort of our lives. Thyr. âThe man who hates to be in Love, âMay be as fond of its delights, âAs one that languishes in tears; âHe shuns the bitter, and enjoys the sweet. Daph. âThe bitter relishes the sweet; âThe pleasure you come at with ease, âSoon cloys, and is not half so great, âAs that which you must get by pain. Thyr. âAnd I had rather soon be cloy'd, âThan always hunger after food. Daph. âBut when the food is once possest, â'Tis then you taste it with delight, âAnd fain would taste again. Thyr. âWho can be when he will possest âOf such rich food? âAnd taste it when his hunger calls? Daph. âHe that ne're seeks can never find. Thyr. â'Tis dangerous to seek the Joys, âWhich pleas'd perhaps when they are found, âBut plague us more if mist âWhen sighs and tears are not requir'd, âThyrsis may be in love again; âI've wept and sigh'd my share, and now âLet others take their turn. Daph. âYou could not stay for your reward. Thyr. âRewards may be too dearly bought, âAnd such I'm not ambitious of. Daph. âYou'd better be inclin'd, than forc'd to Love. Thyr. âI, who from the reach of Love âLive so far, despise his power; âBy my distance I'm secure. Daph. âWho lives beyond the reach of Love? Thyr. âSuch as fear and fly his snares. Daph. âSuch as fear him fly in vain, âLove has Wings as well as Fear. Thyr. âWhen young his Feathers are so short âHe hardly can extend his Wings, âAnd has not strength enough to fly. Daph. âNone perceive him when he's young; âE're you're certain of his birth, âHis Wings grow large, are fit to spread, âAnd he has strength enough to fly. Thyr. âThose who have been never caught âMay be tempted by his Baits. Daph. âWell, let's see if you can still âAll his baits and snares escape; âDo your best, for if at last âYou should be surpriz'd again; âIf I ever hear you sigh, âSee you languish, weep and mourn; âIf you should be griev'd to death, âAnd a touch, a step, or word, âWould assist thee in thy Love, âThou shouldst want such little helps, âAnd dye unpity'd with despair. Thyr. âCould ye, Daphne, see me dye? âThat indeed would be severe: âIf you long to see me Love, âLove me then, and I am thine. Daph. âYou mock me, Youth, but you may know âI'm too young to be despis'd. Thyr. âYou're so fair you may be sure âAll was real that I said: âBut as Women use to do, âYou refuse me, I must bear it, âAnd will strive to be content. Daph. âBe content, and live in peace, âLive in Idleness and Rest, âRest and Idleness beget âTender Wishes, Wishes Love. Thyr. While in this calm repose we live, âAnd fear for nothing but our Lambs; âThe fields abroad are spread with Tents, âThe Swains there change their Crooks for Spears, âTheir harmless Virgins are expos'd âTo all the insolence of Lust. âWhile we enjoy celestial ease, âAnd dread no Enemies but Wolves, âShall I in Loves soft bosom sleep? âNo, Daphne, I'll extend my voice, âAnd sing the wonders of the Man, âThe Godlike Man, who drove the foe âFar from these Woods, and gave us rest. âBut lest my rustick Muse should wrong âHis fame by her inferiour praise, âLike some whom PhÅbus ne're inspir'd, âWho with vile Songs his name abus'd, âWhen they'd have rais'd it to the Skies. âWith awful silence let me wait âTill Heaven the Hero shall restore âTriumphant to us from the War, âThen with fresh Roses strew his way, âAnd lay new Garlands at his feet. Daph. âYou soar aloft: pray if you please, âDescend, and think of our affairs. Thyr. âYou say you have agreed to meet âSylvia at the Fountain, where âYou intend to do your best âFor our miserable friend âI'll go seek Amintas out, âSend him to you, but I fear âHe will be as loth to come, âAs she would be to have him. Dap. âI'll go before, and should you follow, âMake as if you came by chance. Thyr. âI will see. Yon Amintas comes. SCENE II. Amintas, Thyrsis. Amin. I fain, methinks, before I dye, Would know how Thyrsis has succeeded: If he can do more than I Have done, and Sylvia will not hear With patience any one that speaks for me, Here on this spot of Earth I'll end my pains, And in her presence finish with my breath, The tortures of my Soul. The wounds which in my breast my hands shall make Will certainly transport her, since With so much pleasure she beholds The wounds which in my heart her eyes have made. Thyr. Courage, Amintas, I have news To tell thee that will bring thee hope. Amin. Ah, Thyrsis, is it Life or Death? Thyr. 'Tis Life and Joy, if thou art bold enough To meet 'em where they're to be found: But then, Amintas, 'tis requir'd That thou shouldst shew thy self a Man; A Man that dares do any thing for Love. Amin. What must I dare? and whom encounter? Thyr. Suppose your Mistress, in a Wood, Encompast with high Rocks, where Wolves, Where Lyons, Bears and Tygers lurk, Would you to get her venture there? Amin. I'd run as joyfully as e're I went To Dance and Revel at our rural Feasts. Thyr. Suppose her in the hands of Thieves, Amidst arm'd Robbers, would you venture there? Amin. Swift as parcht Stags to cooling Waters run. Thyr. Something more daring, something yet more bold Than this, is to be done to make thee blest. Amin. I'd leap into the Ocean, when the Waves By ruffling Winds are mingled with the Clouds: I'd walk thro Fire, or else, as I've been told Orpheus once did, descend to Hell To find my Sylv'a out, but sure 'Twould not be Hell if she were there. Tell me then where I am to go? And what I am to do? Thyr. Sylvia, naked and alone, Attends thee at Diana's Brook: Amintas durst thou venture there? Amin. What dost thou tell me? Sylvia wait Naked and alone for me? Thyr. Alone, if Daphne is not there; And if she is, you're safe in her. Amin. Wait for me, and naked! Thyr. NakedâButâ Amin. But what? Speak out, thy silence kills me. Thyr. But 'tis not certain that she waits for thee. Amin. This ruins what you said before: Ah! if you were not sure of that, Why, Thyrsis, did you say so much? Why did you shew me joy so near, And fling me from my hopes so soon Sure 'tis not friendly to insult O're one in misery, like me: Did you believe my griefs too light, That you encrease their weight? Thyr. Be rul'd By me, you shall be happy still. Amin. What would ye have me do? Thyr. Go seize The Maid, while Fortune is your Friend. Amin. Ah! Heaven forbid that I should think Of any thing that would displease her, Whom I will ne're offend but by my Love; And if my Love offends her, 'Tis her Beauty's fault, not mine: In all my actions I resolve More to consult her pleasure than my own. Thyr. If not to Love her were in your pow'r, Would you cease loving her to please her? Amin. Love will not suffer me to think Of loving her no more? But if 'Twere in my pow'r, 'twould ne're be in my will. Thyr. If you could cease your Love, you'd still Continue it in spite. Amin. No, not in spite, Yet I would Love her still. Thyr. Tho it were against her will. Amin. Rather than not Love at all. Thyr. Why won't you then against her will Go take the blessing she denies? Because she knows not yet how good 'Twould be to grant the favour you desire. If she at first may be a little vext, She'll soon be well contented with the fault. Amin. Love answers thus to what you say, You have by long experience learnt To reason of those things with art: But tho your argument's too strong For mine, yet I'm convinc'd that 'tis not right. Love, with my tongue, confines my wishes, And will not suffer 'em to stray, Where Sylvia would not let 'em rove. Thyr. Then you resolve you will not go? Amin. Yes, I will go, but not where you Advise. Thyr. Where then? Amin. To Death, if you Can tell me of no other way To life; if this is all the good That you can do me by your help. Thyr. Is this so little then? And canst Thou fancy, foolish as thou art, That Daphne would have bid us come, If she, who knows what Sylvia thinks, Believ'd 'twould give her such offence? She thought perhaps that 'twas not fit For you and me to know as much As she of Sylvia's Soul: Besides, Enquiring farther in so nice a case, Instead of pleasing will displease. You often wisht that you knew how To please her, you may do it now: No matter if you take by theft The joys you covet, or by gift; When once they're tasted she'll forget The Crime, the sin will be so sweet. Amin. But how can I be sure that I may go? Thyr. You can't be surer than you are: She would, as decency requires, Be angry, if you sought to know More than Daphne bid me tell you. Or how can you, on t'other side, Be sure she would not have you come? Since then you may perhaps be thought As guilty should you stay; Proceed: For tho 'tis faulty oft to dare, 'Tis always criminal to fear. Your silence shews that you're convinc'd, And your conviction promises success. Come, follow me, I'll lead the way. Amint. Ah, stay a little. Thyr. Stay! You know Time flys us. Amint. Prithee let us think A little more of what we have to do. Thyr. We'll think a little more then as we go. Come, you may alter if you tarry, Things too much thought on frequently miscarry. CHORUS. Tell us, Cupid, in what Schools, By what masters, by what rules, We must be taught to Love: How thou dost inform the weak, Teach the ignorant to speak So much like you above. âThe Learn'd whom Athens breed, âAnd PhÃ¦bus oft inspire, âMay solemn Lectures read âOn Love, and want its fire. 'Tis thou alone dost warmth impart, Our thoughts and words improve; And only those who learn thy art Of thee, should sing of Love. Inspir'd by thee, the rudest mind In softest notes complains; Wit then in Savages we find, And Eloquence in Swains. âLovers by broken words and sighs âTheir meaning can express; âAnd by their carriage or their Eyes, âWe may their wishes guess. âOthers then may read the wise, âI'll read only Celia's Eyes, âGazing there with much delight âI'll take up my Pen and write. âAnd being thus inspir'd, will try âWho's more elegant than I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Thyrsis, Chorus. Thyr. O cruelty extream! ungrateful Maid! Oh most ungrateful Sex! and thou Oh Nature! careless of thy Sons, Why hast thou plac'd in Womens eyes All that is amiable and kind? And hast forgot to mould their Hearts as soft, Or make 'em with their Eyes agree. Ah, poor Amintas! miserable Youth, Where hast thou hid thy self from human sight? I've sought thee every where in vain; I fear the transports of thy rage Have hurry'd thee to do a thing For which we all must mourn: But see, Perhaps those Swains can tell me where Thou art. Ah Shepherds have ye seen Amintas? Chorus. You seem concern'd: What reason have ye for these tears? Thyr. Amintas, poor Amintas, is the cause: Have ye not seen him lately? Chorus. No; We have not seen him since he went With you towards yonder Wood; but why D'ye ask so earnestly? Thyr. I fear H' has kill'd himself since that. Chor. Amintas kill'd himself! for what? Thyr. âAnothers hatred, and his love. Chorus. âWhen two such Enemies unite. âWhat can they not effect? Explain âYour self more clearly: what d'ye mean? Thyr. He lov'd a Nymph too much, and she âToo much despis'd him for his love. Chorus. Ah tell me all, while you relate The story, some may come this way, And bring us news of him you seek: Perhaps Amintas will himself Before you've finish'd it, arrive. Thyr. Yes, you shall know it, for 'tis but just That such ingratitude should be As infamous as 'tis extream. Amintas heard (I told him where, Alas! and brought him to the place) That Sylvia was with Daphne gone To bath 'em in a neighb'ring Brook, Fearful and dubious there he went, His heart still bidding him to stay, As I perswaded him to go; And thus as he inclin'd to stop, I push'd him on, and forc'd him to proceed. As we approach'd the Brook, we heard A womans lamentable cryes, And Daphne presently appear'd, Beating her Breasts, and looking wild, As if some horrid thing was done; But when she spy'd us, she cry'd out, Help, fly, or Sylvia's ravish'd, fly. Swifter than Leopards on their prey The amorous Amintas slew, I follow'd, and behind the Boughs Saw the young Maid, all naked bound, Her hair, which in bright tresses us'd to flow, Now ty'd her to a Tree: What once preserv'd Her Virgin Bosom from lascivious looks, Was now the fatal Instrument To hurt her Modesty, and bind Her arms about the rugged Bark: Her tender feet were ty'd with twigs: And o're against her I perceiv'd A wicked Satyr, who had then Just fasten'd her for his design: Sylvia, as well she could, strove To hinder his attempts. Chorus. But what Could she have done at last? Thyr. Amintas like a Lyon fierce Rusht on the Satyr with his Dart, I pick'd up Stones, and was prepar'd To help him, when the Monster fled Far from revenge, and left our friend Behind, who now had time to gaze On all the Beauties he ador'd: He saw a thousand hidden Charms, Which set afresh his heart on fire, And easily one in his looks Might read his wonder and delight, Who mingling with his Love Respect, Thus in submissive accents spoke: Forgive, fair Maid, forgive these hands, If they with too much boldness touch Your heavenly body, thus expos'd. Oh! Sylvia, murmur not at fate, Who sent me here to set you free. Chorus. Such words would soften Rocks, And melt the most obdurate heart. What said she now? Thyr. Nothing; but lookt On him who sav'd her, with disdain; Asham'd to be thus found, and loth To be by one she hated, freed. She strove with all her art to hide Her Breasts, and keep 'em from his sight. Amintas coming up with fear, Unbound her Hair, and as he touch'd Her Locks thus said. Oh barbarous Tree, Unworthy of these sacred knots, With which we Lovers only should be bound: Ah how couldst thou such Beauty wrong! Then trembling he unty'd her arms, Whiter than Ivory or Snow, And bending to the ground, began To break the twigs which bound her feet; But Sylvia rudely push'd him off, And spite of his respect, commanded Him proudly not to touch her feet. Hence Shepherd, touch me not, she cry'd, For I'm Diana's, and can loose My feet without your help. Chorus. Oh! how Could she with so much pride reward Such services, and such respect. Thyr. Amintas modestly withdrew, And durst not look on her again, But what he long'd so much to see, With pain deny'd himself, afraid To be by her he lov'd, deny'd. I, who behind the Covert stood, And saw and heard what he had said and done, Was oft by just resentment mov'd, And hardly kept from crying out, To see how haughtily she us'd The man to whom she ow'd her Life, Or what is dearer than her Life, Her Honour, by his means preserv'd. And yet, oh strange ingratitude! When with much trouble she had unty'd Her Feet, away she ran, and scorn'd To bid the Swain adieu: She flew Fast as a Stag, but had no cause To fear Amintas, who had shewn Such proofs of wonderful respect. Chorus. What made her fly? Thyr. She rather chose To owe her safety to her flight, Than to Amintas love. Chorus. She shew'd in this That she delights to be ingrate: Where went the Shepherd then? Thyr. I know not. Justly provok'd, I ran to stop The Nymph, but she was gone too far: When to the Fountain I return'd, In hopes to find Amintas there, I found him not, and fear he's gone To end his troubles with his Life. Chorus. Tho Lovers often talk of death, Few of them practice what they talk. Thyr. I wish he may be one of those. Chorus. He will, you may be sure he will. Thyr. I'll go to Sage Elpinus Bow'r, There, if he lives, perhaps he's gone. Elpinus Pipe has often sooth'd his griefs, Compos'd his thoughts, and gave him rest. Rocks listen to the Shepherds heavenly Songs, Ev'n Mountains by his Musick charm'd Have danc'd, and Rivers flow'd with Milk: Honey from Briars have distill'd, And dying Lovers been with pleasure fill'd. SCENE II. Amintas, Daphne, Nerina. Amin. Oh! Pityless pity, cruel friend! To snatch away my Dart, with which I might have ended all my woes: The longer I retard my death 'Twill be the sharper when it comes. Ah! Daphne, why wouldst thou perswade A wretch to live in misery? But all thy reasons are too weak, The hopes that thou wouldst give me vain: Why wouldst thou flatter me from death, Since 'tis my interest to dye? Daph. Despair no more, for if I know Sylvia's mind, 'twas more her shame, Than fear or scorn that made her fly. Amin. There's safety in despair, but hope Would quickly ruin me: I see You only would by specious hopes Prevent my death a while: for what? Ah! can there be a torment worse Than Life to such a wretch as me? Daph. Live wretched, as thou thinkst thy self, And under all thy pains support Thy heart, that after so much woe, Thou mayst, tho late, o'recome 'em, and be blest; Let this encourage thee to hope, Think on the Beauties thou hast seen; And, as thou justly mayst, expect, That all those treasures will be thine. Amin. Fortune and Love did only shew Those Beauties to me, that my Eyes Might see the riches I'm deny'd. Nerina. Why, like the Raven, must I be The omen of bad news? Ah poor Montano! how wilt thou survive Thy Daughters loss, thy Sylvia's death, The death of one thou lov'dst so well? No more a Father now, at least Without a Child. Daph. I hear the voice Of one that talks of death. Amin. I hear My Sylvia nam'd, it strikes my heart: Who calls on Sylvia? Daph. Ha, Nerina! âSo dear to Cynthia, so fair âHer face, so white her hands, âHer mien so soft, so full of grace, âThat she's the glory of our Woods. Nerina. 'Tis necessary thou shouldst know thy loss, Montano, that thou mayst procure The miserable relicts of thy Child. Oh Sylvia! oh unhappy Maid! Amint. Ha! what of Sylvia? speak. Nerina. Oh Daphne! Daph. What wouldst thou have of Daphne? say. Why dost thou mourn and call on Sylvia? Nerina. I've cause to mourn, the fatal things Which have been to day will make You, him, and every body mourn. Amin. What things? Ah tell me all! my heart Chills at thy words: Speak, does she live? Daph. Tell us what fatal things are done. Nerina. Why have I liv'd, oh Heaven! to be The messenger of these sad tydings. Sylvia came naked to our house, (You know perhaps the fatal cause) Where being cloath'd she fain would go, And forc'd me with her to the Chace. We went, and in the Forest found The Nymphs, who by appointment met, Were ready to begin the sport, When from the Thicket I perceiv'd A Wolf of monstrous size rush forth, Licking his bloody Lips, whose foam Reeking and Crimson, made us shake with fear; But Sylvia from her Quiver took An Arrow, put it to the Bow I gave her, which she nimbly bent, And taking at the Beast just aim, She shot him near the Head; the Wolf enrag'd Fled to the Thicket: Sylvia drew, And brandishing her Dart, pursu'd Him in the Woods. Amint. Oh doleful story! Of which, if 'tis so sad to hear So much, what must it be to know The rest. Nerina. I, with another Dart, Follow'd 'em by the blood the Wolf had spilt, But could not reach 'em, they were gone too far. I lost her in the Woods, yet still Kept on alone, and wander'd thro The frightful Thicket, till I came To its most unfrequented tracts, Where Sylvia's Dart lay on the ground, And at a little distance thence Her veil; and while I gaz'd on these, I spy'd seven Wolves around a Corps, Who tore it with their bloody Teeth. So eager on their Prey, I saw the woful sight unseen by them; With fear and pity mov'd, I turn'd My steps, and got in safety home. This, this is all that I can tell: [Shews the Veil. This all of Sylvia which remains. Amin. Ah! thou hast told too much. Oh! Dear Remains: Oh! precious Blood, Oh Sylvia! now alas no more! Daph. Ah! What, Nerina, hast thou said? It strikes his Soul: he swoons, he dyes! Nerina. Perhaps 'tis but a Lovers fit; He breathes still; see, he comes to life. Amint. Ah! Grief too mighty to be born, And yet too weak to be my death; This office for my hand's reserv'd, And by my hand shall be perform'd. If my misfortunes are so sure, If Sylvia's dead, oh Daphne, why, Why didst thou renew my pain, By bringing me to life again? How good, how pleasant had it been, If n an extasie of woe Thou hadst permitted me to dye: The Gods, who knew I should by this Prevent the torments they've prepar'd For me to feel, inspir'd your hearts With pity, that being forc'd to live I might endure 'em all; and all I have endur'd, for Sylvia's dead: Nor is it possible for me To be more wretched than I am: And now methinks 'tis just that Heav'n and you And all should suffer me to dye. Daph. At least defer it till you know the truth. Amin. I know the truth, I know too much, And have deferr'd my death too long. Nerina. Oh heaven! I wish I had been mute. When I began the story. Amin. Lend me, Nerina, lend the Veil, All that is left me of my love That on it I may feast my Eyes, The little way I have to go, The little time I have to live, That looking on her Blood, I may Go boldly to my doom: But oh What need such little helps To lead me to my end? Nerina. No, Swain, You must not have the Veil, if this Is your design: I'll not promote Your death. Amint. Ah! canst thou, Nymph, deny So small a favour to a man, Who ne're will ask another. The fates still persecute me, still declare Against me, and in little things Shew what I must expect in great. Keep, keep the Veil, and live in peace, Let misery with me forsake these Woods, I go to other Shades, and never shall return. Daph. Stay, stay Amintas, oh I fear His fury. Nerina. But we can't prevent What he intends, he flies Too fast for us; we should in vain Pursue him, and in vain attempt To stop him in his course. In silence I'll their fortune mourn; Let others tell Montano, if they please, Few people thank us for such tales as these. CHORUS. Ye Nymphs, no more take pains to hide Your Love, but own your passion; For Virtue if too nice, is pride, And Coyness Affectation. Cupid make our Virgins tender, Make 'em easie to be won; Let 'em presently surrender, When the Treaty's once begun. Such as like a tedious wooing, Let 'em cruel Damsels find; But for such as would be doing, Prithee Cupid make 'em kind. By a Shepherdess.The fair in the City Don't understand pity, Yet vainly pretend they are wiser than we are: But the Nymph of the plain Should make much of her Swain, And think that the wiser Maids are they're the freer. Be a Shepherd.When we go to our Lasses, To ask their good graces, They ought to receive us, and each take her man; And when we meet first, Since both know the worst, Let's agree to be happy as fast as we can.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Daphne, Sylvia, Chorus. Daph. Thanks to the Gods, that all our tears Were needless, all our plaints and fears In vain, since she for whom we mourn'd Is living, and in health return'd: Long mayst thou live, and Heaven protect The Life, which you too much neglect. Nerina in confusion said Such things as made us think you dead: I wish, to've sav'd us so much grief, She had been dumb, or others deaf. Sylvia. The risque was great, and had you seen The mighty danger I was in, You would your self have said so too. Daph. Not if I had n't known it true. Tell me the risque you ran, and how You scap't the danger. Sylvia. You shall know. Too day I at the Chase pursu'd A Wolf so far into the Wood I lost my Game, I lost the track, And turn'd on purpose to come back, When with seven other Wolves I found The Beast, and knew him by his wound: Round some dead Animal they stood, And tore its flesh, and lickt its blood: The Wolf I shot soon spy'd me out, And left his prey to meet his foe. I with my Dart oppos'd his way, Tho, mistress of my art, you know I very seldom miss my blow, Yet by bad luck I mist it now, And my Dart rested in a Bough: The Wolf at this more furious grew, And got so near me, that I knew My Bow would stand in little stead; So to preserve my self I fled. And as I fled I was methought By somethng which oppos'd me, caught. The Veil I wore hitcht in a Tree, And with my hair entangled me. I pull'd my Veil, I tore my hair, And yet was forc'd to leave it there. Wing'd by my fright away I flew Like air, and so got safe to you. Why, Daphne, are you now so sad: What, can't my safety make you glad? Dap. You live, I'm glad to find it true, And wish another was as safe as you. Sylv. Perhaps you hate me, you appear No more concern'd to see me here. Daph. I hate you not, I joy in your return, But for anothers death must mourn. Sylv. Whose? Daph. Poor Amintas. Sylvia. Tell me how He dy'd. Daph. Ah! that I want to know; We are not certain yet he's dead, But we believe't. Sylvia. What hast thou said! Ah, Daphne, say to what alas, Do people attribute the cause? Daph. Thy death. Sylvia. Explain your self. Daph. The news He heard will certainly produce Some dreadful deed, Despair will lend Him arms, to help him to his end. Sylvia. It may be your suspicions are in vain, And, he as well as I, may rise again From Death; besides 'tis very rare For men to let their troubles go so far. Daph. Sylvia, little dost thou know What some men in Love will do: Thou dost little think how much Every accident will touch Hearts of Flesh, and not of Stone, Not so cruel as thy own. Hadst thou known the man that dyes Lov'd thee better than his Eyes, Thou wouldst have been less severe, And prevented his despair. Had you seen him but to day, After you were ran away. Sylvia, you'd with reason fear, Your disdain has gone too far. âSuch ingratitude you show'd, âTo the man to whom you ow'd, âLife and Honour, all that's dear, âI can tell for I was there. âI can witness what was done, âSaw him save you, and you run, âVVhen sure, after that had past âHe deserv'd to be embrac'd. Then I saw him take his Dart, Turn the point against his heart, Strike his breast, and from the wound Saw the blood flow on the ground. I came in, and much ado Hinder'd him a second blow. Sylvia, thus you see how far Some are hurry'd by despair. So much may by this be guest, We have cause to dread the rest. Sylvia. What have I heard? Daph. Things indeed, Enough, alas, to make thee dread What thou art yet to hear. Thence as we were coming back We met the Nymph, who by mistake Inform'd us you were slain; the youth, Without examining the truth, Believ'd, despair'd, and in the heat Of grief, sell breathless at our feet. We took him up, he breath'd again, We strove to comfort him in vain; For all the reasons we could give, Could not prevail on him to live: But rushing forth, away he fled To death, and I believe is dead. Syl. D'ye really believe it? Daph. Yes. Syl. Ah! why Did you not follow him, and fly Fast as his fury, to prevent The consequence of his intent. Ah let us seek him out, and strive To make him yet consent to live. Since he that for my Death would dye, Should for my Life revive. Daph. We follow'd, but he flew like wind: He left us panting far behind; And long e're this has done what he design'd. Whither then, Sylvia, would you run? And who shall tell us where the wretch is gone? Syl. Ah, let us go where grief and pity lead; Haste, Daphne haste, or he'll be dead; By himself murder'd. Daph. You would save The unhappy Lover from the Grave, To murder him your self: To you You think the Glory's only due. But you've no reason to repine, For let the blow be his or thine, Twill be his death, and thou mayst see; With comfort, that he dy'd for thee. Syl. Daph. It torments my mind When I consider how unkind, How cruel I have been: Pride I call'd Honour once, perhaps 'Twas Honour, but 'twas too severe; And such as will, if he is dead, Sharpen my grief, my cruelty reprove, And force me to repent I wrong'd his Love. Daph. Oh Heaven! She's pitiful, repents, Her heart grows tender, she relents; She weepsâ Is thy pride humbled then? O strange! Whence, Sylvia, comes this mighty change? Whence all these tears, from Pity or from Love? Syl. Pity, not Love, attracts my tears Daph. Pity's Love's Messenger, and shews, As Lightning before Thunder goes, Love is not far. Chorus. When he'd surprize a Maid Who of his Empire is afraid, Who by false honour would defend her heart, And be secure against his Dart, He takes his Servant Pity's shape, And in that figure few escape His snares, he slily wins on every heart, And beaten off by force, prevails by art. Daph. Love at first in storms appears, Waited on by sighs and tears: Love has touch'd thee, tho too late, Into fondness turn'd thy hate. Ah Amintas, Sylvia's chang'd, Weeps for Love, and thou'rt reveng'd. Now thou mayst the Conquest boast, Which if living thou hadst lost. Thou hast Dying left behind Such a sting in Sylvia's mind, As will work more mischief there, Than thou ever feltst for her. Bees thus can't their Stings outlive, But perish with the wounds they give. If thou'rt, as I believe, a Spirit, fled From the bright mansions of the dead; From heavenly Groves, and sacred streams, To play unseen about her Limbs, See, Sylvia weeps, behold how much she's mov'd, You lov'd alive, and are when dead belov'd. âIf Destiny had so decreed, âThat thou shouldst for thy Mistress bleed; âIf in her thoughts she had resolv'd that this, âWhene're she sold her Love, should be the price, â'Tis thine, now thou hast done thy part, âAnd with thy Life hast bought her heart. Chor. âToo vainly sold, and bought too dear; âFor him too hard, too infamous for her. Syl. Oh that my Love could fetch again his breath, Or my heart purchase him of Death. Oh that my Life could be the price, I'd gladly part with it for his. Daph. Too late you're pitiful and wise, Your tears are useless, and in vain your sighs. SCENE II. Ergastus, Chorus, Sylvia, Daphne. Ergastus. Pity and horror have so far Possest my Soul, I know not what I hear or see, but every thing I meet, amazes and afflicts me. Chor. What tydings hast thou brought, which make Thy looks thus troubled, and thy words Confus'd. Ergast. I bring the bitter news Of poor Amintas death. Syl. What is't he says? Ergast. The noblest Shepherd of these Woods, The kind, the gay, the gentle Swain, Our Virgins and the Muses darling, Young as he was, is dead; but how; Oh! who can tell, or hear it told? Chor. Tell all, that we may mourn with thee His sad misfortunes and our own. Syl. Oh! how can I stay to hear This most horrid story out? Where is all my fierceness now? Oh! my heart, so haughty once, Shew thy Pride, and if thou canst Stay and hear it all unmov'd: Speak then what thou hast to say. Shepherd, let me know the worst, Tell it me, I'm most concern'd; Speak, I'm ready for thy news. Ergast. Nymph, I know thou art concern'd, Dying, the Despairing wretch Call'd on thee, and with thy name Finish'd his unhappy Life. Daph. Prithee begin the dismal tale. Ergast. Sitting on yonder Hill, where I Had laid some Nets, I saw but now Amintas run that way; his looks Distracted, and his carriage wild; His eyes, his mein so chang'd, I thought That something strange might happen since I left the Vale: he spy'd and shunn'd me, Fearing the worst; I then pursu'd, O'retook and stopp'd him; he grew calm, Begg'd me to go and see him do A thing which he pretended then He was oblig'd to do, but first Forc'd me to swear I would not stir, Beyond the bounds he set, nor lift My hands to hinder him. I swore By Pan, by Pallas, by Pomona, And all our Sylvan Deities, (Alas! not thinking what he meant.) I would not stir nor lift my hands, Unless he gave me leave. This done, He led me to a Precipice, Where, from the margent of the H Directly down the pathless dale, Between high Rocks appears, my head Grew giddy, I stepp'd back, afraid To view the depth: Amintas smil'd And look'd serenely, which deceiv'd My fears, and made me more assur'd. Thus then he saidâ Ergastus, tell The Nymphs and Swains what thou shalt see, Since, since he cry'd, and then look'd down, The Gods will not permit my end To be the same with Sylvia's since My Limbs must not be torn like hers, And I'm deny'd the Paws and Teeth Of Wolves to use, as they serv'd Her lovely Body: I must take Whatever death they please to send. These Rocks direct the way, I wish I had deserv'd the same with hers. But this is sure and short. Oh see! I follow thee, my Sylvia, don't Disdain my Company in death. I'd dye contented, were I sure 'Twould not displease thee, I should then, Oh Sylvia, follow thee with joy. I come, I follow thee, I come: And saying this, He threw him headlong down, While my heart chill'd to see him fall. Daph. Oh miserable youth! Sylv. Oh Heavens! Chorus. But why Ergastus did you not prevent him? Was it your Oath that ty'd your hands, And kept you back? Ergast. No, I despise Such Oaths, and look on them as vain, When I perceiv'd his folly went So far, and his deliberate despair Ready to fling him from the Precipice, I ran to save him, and as fate Would have it, came in time enough To catch him by the Girdle, which The burthen of the Body broke, And lest it rent thus in my hands. Cho. Where went the miserable Body then? Ergast. I know not what became of that. Horror and Pity struck my soul So deeply, I had not the heart To see it dash in pieces. Cho. Oh strange! Oh woful accident! Sylv. Sure my heart is made of stone, Or it must have bled to death, E're the dismal tale was done. Oh! if he could dye for me, One who hated him so much, When he falsely thought me dead, What shall I do now, I know He is certainly no more? I must dye, and dye I will: Swords and Rocks are left for me: This precious Girdle is preserv'd To revenge its gentle Lord. Unhappy Girdle! Dear Remains Of thy more unhappy Lord! Be not angry that thou'rt kept From thy Master; 'tis to be The Instrument of Vengeance On the Maid for whom he dy'd. I should, I own I should have been Amintas kind Companion here; But since I can't be so, I will, By thy assistance quickly follow him, And bear him company in Death. Chor. Comfort thy self, poor Virgin, 'tis The hand of Fate, and not thy fault. Sylv. Why weepst thou Swain? if 'tis for me, Weep not, for I deserve no tears, No pity; I who never knew What pity was: If 'tis for him, For poor Amintas, thou mayst weep A Sea of Tears, and yet want more. Daphne, if thou dost mourn for me, For Heavens sake, prithee mourn no more; I beg, not out of pity to my self, But out of pity to the man Who merited thy Love, that thou Wouldst help me gather up his Bones, And lay 'em in a Grave; 'tis this Which only shall prolong my Life: This friendly office, all that I Can pay him for his heart, shall be my care. The Piety of such a deed By my vile hands will be defil'd: Yet I believe whate're these hands Shall do for him will please his Ghost, Since, spite of all his wrongs, I'm sure He lov'd me to the last. Daph. I'll go And help you, but you must not think Of dying after we've perform'd Our duty to our friend. Sylv. Hitherto I've only liv'd For my self, the little time That's now left me, I'll devote To Amintas, if I can't Live for him, I'll live at least For his pale unhappy Body. I must put off death a while, Till I've seen it, and then end With his Funeral my Life. Shepherd, lead us to the Vale, To the fatal Precipice. Ergast. Keep this path, you cannot miss the way. Daph. Come, I'll conduct ye, follow me; I know the place, 'tis not far off. Sylv. Farewel Shepherds, farewel Plains, Woods and Streams, and all farewel. Ergast. She heartily repents her scorn, And talks as if she never would return. CHORUS. Death in vain opposes Love, Who conquers every Foe; To his Empire all above Submit, and all below. What Love unites Death seldom parts, And what he parts Love often joyns; Triumphs o're Death, resists his Darts, And will himself alone command our minds. âMaids comply with Love in time, âEre your Error grows a Crime; âE're he makes you yield by force. âAh, consider 'twill be worse âTo rebel, and be subdu'd, âThan obey him as you shou'd. âWhen he summons you at first, âYield, or else expect the worst: âLate Repentance will be too âUseless to your Friend and you. Death in vain, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Elpinus, Chorus. Elpin. Oh Love! how rigid are thy Laws? How much must all that once subject Themselves to thee, endure before They taste the promis'd joy? Who, who would not have curst thy power, Rebell'd against thy sway, and sought Some other way to bliss? if poor Amintas had not scap'd the deaths Thy usage tempted him to seek. Ev'n we, who have ador'd thee long With much fidelity and zeal; We, who have rais'd thy name above All other Gods, to whom we make Our own Apollo yield; should then Have taught our Children to forget Thy worship, and forsake thy Temples. But now that our Amintas lives, We'll, if 'tis possible, forget Thy Cruelty, to bless thy Care. Chorus. The Sage Elpinus comes and talks As if Amintas were alive: Ah Shepherd! didst thou know the things Which we have heard to day; the ills That Love has brought on all, thou wouldst Have little reason to forget His Cruelty, or bless his Care. Elpin. Rejoyce, my friends, rejoice, the news You heard is false; Amintas lives. Chor. Ah! what, Elpinus, dost thou say? How dost thou comfort us? Is't false? Did he not fling himself but now From yonder Hill among the Rocks? Ah! tell us how he was preserv'd? what pow'r, What God was by, to save him at his fall? Elpin. Hear then what I shall say, no more Than I have with these eyes beheld. I've in the Desart Vale a Cave, Where Thyrsis came to me to day, Where, while we talkt of that proud Nymph Whose Fetters formerly he wore, And I at present wear, we heard A voice, and lookt up tow'rds the hill; Whence, down the Precipice, we saw A Body tumble on a Bush. Just by my Cave, and near the Mount, A few tall Bushes rise from Box, And other Trees, which all unite In one; on these we saw him fall: But, carry'd by the Body's weight, He rowl'd off thence, and at our feet Fell next; the Bushes sav'd the blow So much, we took him up alive. He was yet speechless, and 'twas long E're we had any other signs Of Life, besides his sighs and groans, which shew'd Us that he breath'd: But, oh! When we perceiv'd who 'twas, what tongue Can tell the fright which we were in? Pity and wonder struck us dumb: Yet thinking by his breath, he might Still live, we were a little calm'd. Chor. Oh wonderful Escape! Oh thou Hadst cause, Elpinus, to applaud The Care and Providence of Love. Elp. Thyrsis then told me what had past, The secret of his Love, and how Despair had hurry'd him to this. We fetch'd the Remedies we had At hand, and for Alfibeus sent, Who by Apollo has been taught The Art of Physick; when he came, He told us quickly, there were hopes. And as we wept to see him still Lye speechless in his arms he said We should not be surpriz'd at that; For, having searcht him well, he found No wounds, nor any thing which might With reason make us fear: 'Tis true, He said he might be some time in a Trance, But after would recover soon. And having then perform'd his Art, He order'd men to bear him home, Who at a little distance hence, Are coming with our Friend. Chorus. What Fools are men in Love? how apt To be deceiv'd, how ready oft To joyn with those they love to cheat themselves? What mischiefs have their false despairs, And groundless hopes begot? How near Was poor Amintas rash mistake, Depriving us of what we all Expected in our time to see, The grace and pleasure of these woods? Elp. Alfibeus with his charge appears, And in his Looks we may discern, How much Amintas safely glads His soul as well as ours. SCENE II. Elpinus, Chorus, Thyrsis, Alfibeus, and Amintas born on a Couch. Alfib. Oh Swains! Oh Nymphs! Oh all that ever lov'd This youth, and who of ye that heard Him sing, Or saw him at our sports, But heard and saw him with delight? To PhÃ¦bus, and to Love, address Your vows, that once more you may hope To hear and look on him with pleasure. SCENE III. Elpinus, Thyrsis, Alfibeus, Chorus, Daphne, Sylvia, Amimtas lying on a Couch. Daphne. Ah Shepherds join your pray'rs with mine. Use all the Arguments which Grief And Pity can inspire, to save This Maid from ruine. Stay, Sylvia, stay, till you've perform'd What you resolv'd, and what you owe Amintas Spirit, till the hands Which you your self confess'd would please His Ghost, to see 'em gather up His bones, had laid 'em in a Grave. Sylv. Some God, alas! has done what I Resolv'd to do, and to revenge Amintas wrongs, deny'd my hands The glory of so just a deed. Tell me, ye Powers! ah tell me where You have convey'd my Love, and laid His mangled Limbs? Direct me where, That I may see 'em e're I dye: That I may feast my cruel eyes With objects equally severe: And if I can, instruct my heart To be more barbarous to my self, Than e're it was to him. Daph. Cease, prithee Sylvia cease your tears, And don't torment thy self too much For ills, thy sorrows can't retrieve. Sylv. See, Daphne, how these Shepherds smile At my Despair, how unconcern'd They hearken to my griefs; ev'n I, As savage as I was, scarce saw Amintas mourn with so much ease. Daph. Hence, Shepherds hence, and don't disturb. The wretched with untimely joy. Sylv. Not that I court your pity, or Expect compassion, but methinks Amintas death should touch your hearts; And you should still consider me As one Amintas lov'd. But oh! You look on me as one that hated him, You see his murderer in me, and set Your souls against the cause of so much woe. Oh! that you all could in this minute lose Your native tenderness, and that your rage Were equal to your hate, that I might soon Be sent to meet him in those blissful plains, Where he himself will treat me with more love. Alfib. Sylvia forbear these sad complaints, And don't afflict your self for things Which heaven has wonderfully made The subject of our joy, Amintas lives. Syl. Ha, Daphne, whither are we got? I heard a voice, which said Amintas lives; And in the midst of grief invites to joy. Ha! see what heavenly vision strikes my eyes, Behold it well, my Friend, and tell me then If any thing but my Amintas self Could look more lovely. 'Tis Amintas self, I know him now: I feel him at my heart, It dances in my breast, and bids me do What Love commands and you must all excuse. [Falls on Amin.] Chorus. How can Sylvia do all this? She who is so proud and nice One would think should be asham'd. Elpin. Shame sometimes, where Love is weak, Keeps some Maids from being free; But when it grows strong, like hers, Love's too powerful for shame. Syl. Where, where is he who said Amintas lives? Let him come here, and tell me if he can, Why his eyes languish, why he looks so pale? Why lifeless, when his Sylvia clasps him thus, And deaf to all she says? Ah speak, my Love, Inform me if my glances hurt thy eyes, And drive away thy Soul from what it loaths. Whoe're thou art that said Amintas lives, 'Twas falsely said, and with a vile intent To shew me hope, and leave me in despair. He lives indeed, but in a better world, Whence now methinks I hear him call on me, And Sylvia's name is in Elysium sung. Amin. Where am I? on what happy Region thrown? What Musick wakes me from the arms of death, And charms me with the name of my belov'd? Oh! all ye Glorious Spirits, who in peace And perfect bliss possess these sacred Groves, Direct me to the Bow'r, where Sylvia waits For me, whom now she can no longer hate, Since all Paradice are friends. Sylv. He speaks, he lives, and injur'd as he was, Talks kindly of me still. Look up Amintas, Look on thy Sylvia with thy usual joy, And let thy Eyes speak kindly, like thy Tongue. Amin. Who breathes new life into me with her kisses, And quickens me with her embraces? Ha! my Love, My Sylvia winding in my arms! I can scarce Spare time to ask the meaning of these things? Have not I seen you all, and been your friend? And is not this the darling of my Soul? Yes, yes, 'tis she; her Beauty shews 'tis she, Nor could I feel such Transports with another. Alfib. His Love prevents my Art, and he revives Faster than I expected. Elpin. But I fear The violence of such excessive bliss Will prejudice his health. Chorus. I rather think Its violence will help to cure him. Alfibeus you must tell him what's Most proper for his safety. Alfib. I believe His safety is secur'd in Sylvia's Love. How fares Amintas? Amin. Oh, all is well, and I begin to think Love has for me done Miracles to day. Thyr. Love has indeed done Miracles to save Thy life, and soften Sylvia's heart. Syl. Tell us no more, 'twill interrupt our bliss. Let him not know what dangers he has scap'd; When he reflects how barb'rous I have been He'll loath me for my Cruelty, and hate A Maid who so unjustly hated him. Amin. Oh Sylvia! we'll not think of what is past, I'll not enquire how I became so blest, But thank the Gods and thee for what I know. As for the rest, thou could'st not but just; And love decreed the troubles we have known, To shew his Pow'r, and make our bliss the greater. Elp. There's nothing wanting but Montano's word, To make 'em both as happy as they wish. Cho. They need not question his content, He longs to see his Daughters Sons, To sport about him and revive His Age, and soon will grant what they desire. Alfib. Then let us to her Fathers house repair And see him join their hands and share his joy. Amint. You all may by my fate perceive The Laws which Love prescribes Mankind, By which Eternally he rules His Empire here, Are not fantastical and hard, As sometimes we suppose his works, Tho they're mysterious, are wise And such as we should ne're condemn, With how much art, thro' hidden ways, And paths unknown, he leads to bliss. And when we think him ready to destroy, He opens Paradice, and leaves our Souls enjoy. FINIS.</field>
