      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Chorus. As toiling Hercules forced Hell's grim door, And viewed the nether mysteries of fate; So doth the buskin'd Muse of tragic lore Burst through the ancient adamantine gate That gives to night the secrets of the past. Listen! She opens rounded mouth to tell A thing, unguessed beforeârevealed at last. She whom our first Plantagenet too well Loved, and for whom he built the marble maze, Was no rich crimson beauty of old line, As fabled in proud histories and lays; No Clifford, as 'tis boasted; but, in fine, A girl o' the country, delicately made Of blushes and simplicity and pure, Free ardour, of her sweetness unafraid; For Rosa Mundiâof this truth be sureâ Was nature's Rose, not man's: as ye shall see In this sad tale of lovers' destiny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âWoodstock. Masons raising the Labyrinth. Enter at a distance King Henry and Mavis. 1st Mason. Yonder is the King. 2nd Mason. He's aged of late. 1st Mason. Ay, ay! about the face; his fiery hair Is dimmed as if by smoke; his hollow eye Is like a haughty general's retreat. Yet is he stout in body, well-nigh young. 2nd Mason. Some note he stoops a little i' the back Since he was whipped in church. 1st Mason. Dare-devil, peace! He's straight enough; it is the monks that squint. 2nd Mason. Mum, mum! 1st Mason. Why, wherefore? 2nd Mason. 'Cause the sun's come out That wakens us to labour in the glance O' Master Mavis' eye. Mavis. My gracious liege. . . . King Henry. Thou hast a spider's entrails for thy brain, To spin me such a web. Mavis. Upon that Cretan wonder did I think, That held the misbegotten Minotaur, Untilâso worked my fancy on its shapeâ Abortive circles built I airily, And founded hoary walls as in a dream. I entered the dim vistas, saw above The ribboned sky Blue as the fillets of a troop of girls. 'Twas magic certainty directed me To the mid-chamber, straight as arrow takes The eye o' the target; and Conception stood Above my dreams, their secret throughly solved. Sir Topaz. I take it, Master Mavis, that you are what they call a genius, for your talk is warm as a summer's day. Mavis. I spoke too freely. Pardon, gracious sire. There's many a page within the head our tongue Should skip as reader. Sir Topaz. Now I do believe I've touched some quick, and given some unconjecturable pain. On my faith, good fellow, I know not what I have done. My apology is an infantâ'tis that innocent. Mavis. Oh, nothing, sir. 'Twas I that cut myself With a knife that's in my mouth. Sir Topaz. Pardy, I'm grieved to the heart if I offended. And 'tis so fair a buildingâa very roseâyou've carved on the ground. K. Hen. A what? Sir Topaz. So many curves, circular and broken, I said, sire, the building was in that respect like a rose. K. Hen. Oh, ay! the garden rose, our cultured rose, That's folded up in crimson like a queen. Ay, ay! Then, Master Architect, I'd know How many days before your labour's close? Mavis. Five, gracious liege, if every sinew work From dawn to midnight, spite of curfew's toll Above the hooded forest; on such terms Will incompletion yield. K. Hen. And such we grant, Though hard upon your craftsmen and yourself; Necessity is on her knees to us That we should use ye harshly. Mavis. Be it so. Sir Topaz. Ah, ah! He'll be right glad when 'tis finished. Mavis. No; for my toil hath flushed Time's langui cheek. K. Hen. I'd have ye mark yon varlets! Make them skip With energy of blows, and never spare. Each moment is my prey the dogs should seize; I will not brook the loss. Mavis. Your servant, sire [Moves towards the masons. K. Hen. Sir Topaz. . . . Sir Topaz. Sire. K. Hen. I think you never married? Sir Topaz. Nay. Nor have I within me that which could be quickened into the desire. K. Hen. So proof against the arrow-headed pangs? Sir Topaz. 'Tis thus. The woman-child died I loved as a lad, and my love never grew after. 'Tis a little thing of her size. K. Hen. Oh! then you know Love's root as well as flower; The hidden cords that darkling bind the heart With hungry vehemence and never loose. Oh! they may pluck and smell the joyful red Of golden-scented blossom, call it love; But there are fibres down, down in the depths, That never shall be moved, by which it lives. Sir Topaz. Constancy . . . K. Hen. I did not speak of that, I spoke of love When planted in the red soil of the heart; Of its insatiate girth; of Rosamund, And how she's everywhere about my soul. I think I told you once how first we met. She gathered cherry-blossoms, and I bent The bough to her; when, lo!âjust where they bunchedâ Whitest, there hid a little hand more white, I kissed it, and her upturned face grew white To swooning, and the breath stood at her lips. I longed to be a soul from Holy Land, With shrift won at the Holy Sepulchre; To touch her flesh made me a penitent; The pressure of that kissing broke the seal To all the wine that filled the stony jar Of my unusÃ¨d past. To her I was No king of menâonly the great Lord Love, To whom she gave, as she were born to it, Unthinking loyalty. I've never known Such homage, only sullen tolerance And darkest-featured hate. Sir Topaz. My dear liege, you have ever made light of your griefs. K. Hen. Because I was a loveless man and blind. Vain, flippant men have tied round Cupid's eyes The badge of their own shame; his heavenly orbs See fairest things where others scarce see fair, Behold in darkness sooty hells more deep. Sir Topaz. Sire, these words afflict me beyond speech. Is there any service you can put me to, aught you can trust to an old man's care? K. Hen. Yes, yes; my love, the bright gold of my heart, Be thou its treasurer,âbe that which I Would give my heart to be. Sir Topaz. Warden of the labyrinth and guardian of the lady! With joy, and in all fidelity. K. Hen. 'Tis well; I shall remember. But to give This charge unto another is as hard As to pull life and arrow from the breast Together. Sooth, I am too heavy-souled That I should stumble 'gainst thy kindliness With such a clown's heel of ingratitude. O honest Topaz, as complete my trust In thee as is my perfect love to her. Full well I know thou'lt dragon all my wealth, That none shall be enriched. Yet solitude May gyve thy days as iron. Will it? Speak. Sir Topaz. Oh, I'll marry Seclusion for the sake of getting famous progenyâMeditationâPeace. K. Hen. Why should I ask? Was it a country lass? Sir Topaz. What lass? K. Hen. She thou didst . . . Sir Topaz. Ay, ay! K. Hen. So long ago! and after all at peace! Come, we must hasten back. Ho, Mavis, there! Five days! Mavis. As said, so be it, gracious liege. Scene II. âWoodstock, by the Forester's hut. Enter Rosamund and Margery. Mar. 'Tis wonderful to see 'em dance . . . Ros. And strange That I may never see an elf, although I roam at evening underneath the trees, And love their crumpled gloom. Mar. Oh, you should see! Ros. Ah, if I could. What is it in thine eyes? Why, 'tis their magic black, the naughty hue Beloved Of shy hob-goblins. Mar. You are blue, and safe? Ros. Safe from enchantment? Yes, or nearly so. I never see the fairies. Mar. Secretly You take that light green path,âI've seen you there,â An' look behind you; an' I laughed and thought, âShe thinks none sees the elves dance but herself.â I've watched for you as weasel from its hole, Behind the mossy wall, an' dare not speak, You came along so new and wonderful. It must have been the elves. Ros. Go, Margery; The fire is low, and father's supper-time! Mar. He likes you best to wait on him. Ros. Peace! go! [Exit Margery within. I'm fretful . . . and my father turned Once, when we stood together by the door,â We always settle in the sunset so, And do not speak,âthat night he turned and went Into the house, as I had not been there. My heart stood still to hear him . . . Henry! The old when lonely must be very lone; They sit and watch so patient by the fire, And there is none to come to them save Death. I'll back directly, for I love him more Not less, though I'm so hard, with better love, Bright coinâthe king's face shining on it clearâ Not the worn pieces. Yonder is the beech! I play sometimes when it is very long Wi' the tiny urns, and say they hold my tears. [Exit behind the trees. [Enter Wilfred.] Wil. This must be the hutâthe nest of sticks where is found the King's dove. Ha, ha! famously said. But I saw him, like a hawk, and his pigeon can't escape. I spied him, and 'twill make my fortune with the Queen. Down in the midst of the trees he toyed with her and kissed herâpat!âas I looked. Ha! ha! I saw but little of that joust of lips, the crimson couples tilted too far off; yet I was witness, and my fortune's made. I'll knock, and use my eyes. [Knocks. [Enter Margery from within.] Fair damsel, pardon me; such sudden light Is dazzlingâ Mar. Please you, enter sir; the sun Shines as one cannot bear it on the face. It's dark inside. Wil. [aside]. The blessed simpleton! What eyes!âto stir one's bloodâand shapely cheek, As brown and red and dimpled as an apple. We'll have an hour together in the wood. [Aloud] Your father is within? Mar. He's late to-night. Wil. Has he a fair young dog? Mar. Our Blanche has pups. I play with them. Wil. No other playfellows? Mar. What, have you guessed?âthe fairies! Wil. On my soul! Do you dance with them? Tell me where they break The ring to let you in to be their queen. Ay? Mar. By the beeches. Wil. Where the old wall lies Half ruined? Mar. Yes. Wil. At this end or at that? Mar. Right yonder, all among the elders there. You'd never see 'em. They are very shy, I fancy. But they like me; so I'd make A little cap each. Look! I'm sewing it. This bit o' red. I see you wear red, sir. Wil. A plume of red, but this is iron mail. I'll let you handle it.âAh! who comes here? Who's that? [Re-enter Rosamund.] Mar. My sisterâand so beautiful, You'll like to see her. Wil. Little hypocrite! You've got too bright an eye to wish it matched. [Aside] Oh! but she's beautiful, and yet withal Too self-sufficient; one of Nature's prudes, Who wrap their beauty round them as a cloak, Nor wave it as a veil. This browner girl Is Nature's very wantonâwill be mine. [Aloud] Good even. Shall I say it is mischance Compels me speak of business that would be Of interest to your father, though to you Indifferentâor Heaven's peculiar grace That gives me vision of two lovely maids Who came to choose a setter?âfor I've heard Your father breeds such. Ros. It is accident. I'm sorry father's out. Yet since I come To lay his supper, I can give you hope You have not journeyed bootless. Sit, sir knight! Mar [aside]. Sir knight! Wil. Nay, rather kneelâthus. Ros. Compliments Are here ill-breeding. We are simple folk, And I am no court-lady. Mar. Rosamund! But very pretty. Wil. Ladies! Name them not; There is not one to match you. Why, the heave Of your green vesture sets desire to think On the globing water-lilies underneath Their buds' enthralment; while my city dames Trick the round swell with gauds and broidery, Befooling eager gazeâ Ros. I'm maiden, sir, As well as no court-lady. Wil. I'll affect Clownishness, if it please you.âI will watch Yon forester until I'm churl in full. [Enter Michael.] Michael. Ay, ay! how now, wench? Ros. Father! . . . Wil. [aside]. Why, her eyes Flash to him as the lightning to a stump; And yet she is the minion of a king! Mar. He wants a dog. He's a sir knight. Mich. Ay, ay! the least of the pups. He shall not have the brown one with a star. Wil. Old man, I'd see your dogsâfor such you breed, The country-side allows, as none about. Mich. Your honour's servant and King Henry's slave. Wil. 'Tis for the Queen. Mich. Her humble slave. I've got Some few behind the hatch. Wil. I'll come.âYou've bred The fairest daughters of the country-side. Mich. Oh, ah! the brownie's mine. It was a wench Like nuts I wedded, an' so full of prayers I always had my luck. The comely oneâ Why, she's my fosterling: her father, sir, A man-at-arms; her mother! never saw So fine a womanâjust as red and white As any lady born. I'll ask you, sir, To step behind. An' girls, for shame, go in! [Exeunt Wilfred and Michael. Ros. Margery! Mar. I cannot come. I'll creep Behind 'em. Ros. No; it is not maidenly To be so free with strangers. Mar. What a man! With such big, ugly cheeks, like father's bull; And did you see his great damp curls, an's eyes? Such eyes that roll about youâ Ros. Margery, Be quiet! He's a wicked man. Don't speak About his face. Mar. He's nasty; but he talks As kind as can be for a gentleman. Ros. [aside]. O Henry! [aloud] They are coming back. We'll go. [Exeunt Rosamund and Margery. Scene III. âWinchester: a room within the Palace. Enter Queen Elinor and the Princes Henry and Richard. Queen Elinor. Upon the yellow ground of Africa Young lions tear each other; so these sons, Whom I, above all women, in my pride, May proudly claim my offspring, wage a strife Each against each. I care not. 'Tis the blood Insurgent of their equal parentage. P. Henry [to Richard]. Ud's death! Thou wilt defy me to my face, Deny my birthright and my crown's right too, Because, forsooth, we're brothersâyou who crawled Behind me into light, who took the path Which I discovered, in that very act Sealing yourself my followerâbound to keep A year's step lower in the court of Time; You to whose brow no golden circle gave It's pledge of loyalty; you, you to brag!â Q. Elin. Urged like my own young monarch. P. Rich. Glorious fool! That cannot match a thunderstorm in noise For all thy clapping lungs! I'll sing you still. My blood is wine that ran from the same press As your bright liquor; and the vessel!âsee, I'm broad and tall as you! Ay, mother? Q. Elin. Yes. My thumb's nail taller. P. Rich. Holding so much more Of the blue juice of royalty. Nay, nay; Ennoble not your heelsâthose labourers O' the soil. It were a shame. P. Hen. I'll make yours fly. P. Rich. Why then my knees would stand. Q. Elin. The lion-heart! P. Rich. Yea, get me prone, my spirit still would rise Erect before you, spite of the false show. Kill meâI'd face you as a spectre tall With chin that topped your mouth. Q. Elin. Divinely bold! P. Rich. I'll never yield in heaven, on earth, in hell. P. Hen. Thou shalt by everything immovable, The throne of God and Satan's iron roof! I swear thou shalt. P. Rich. By all that never yields, The punishment of fiends and sinners' dole, I swear I never will. P. Henry. I've sworn. P. Rich. But I Swore many days ago. Ha, ha, my oath Is first-born and the heir of Fate. Q. Elin. Well put, My own young warrior. P. Hen. I'll turn the edge Of thy own sword against thee, as I live. In Aquitaine Bertram de Born, the troubadour, is mad Beneath thy scorpion rule. I'll use his rageâ P. Rich. Offal! P. Hen. Then shalt thou eat of it. P. Rich. Sweet cook! Q. Elin. Ha, ha! P. Hen. S'death, I will waste no further threatsâ No comets of my passionâbut thou'lt know Destruction and remember how they flared. I'll to De Born. P. Rich. And I to Aquitaine. P. Hen. [shaking his fist]. My sign of parting. P. Rich. Mine. Q. Elin. Now here's a cheek For eachâand kiss me both togetherâso, My mouth is herald 'tween the lips arrayed In double line of battle on each side. FarewellâFarewell! Thank God you have repaid My flesh and blood in you with usury. P. Hen. I'll force his homage. P. Rich. I'll bring down his pride Q. Elin. They feed my heart! [Exeunt severally. [Enter Beatrix.] Beatrix. Your majesty. Q. Elin. Oh pray For motherhood; it is the golden thread On which are strung the agesâ Beat. Gracious Queen! Q. Elin. Time works within our wombs as in the depths Of earth the miner. There are found the gems He wears before the light, and there the dross That makes the dull pile of oblivion.â Well? Beat. I am bidden ask your instant leave To hear De Lacy speakâ Q. Elin. You velvet moth, Of you? I will not listen to his suit. He only lures with flame to drown in oil Of dull neglect. Man's lamp of love is set Ever to such low issues. Beat. Not of meâ Of matter fitting but your private ear He chafes to speak. My dearest sovereign, you Should hold so stout a liegeman in regard, Your service is his very stuff of life, The yarn of all his time. He would be nothing Without your favour. The King loves him not. Q. Elin. Oh, the King loves none. Beat. I fear he's deep in love. Q. Elin. The King in love! It was my hope that mornâ You rode the spotted palfreyâI the greyâ My bridegroom with the bright half-rubied hairâ Woman, you must remember how we saw Our lover on the knoll, above the bend O' the road, ere he was 'ware of us. Ah me! You bring me news my Henry is in love? His youngest lad Is in his teensâin love? Beat. Then shall I call Sir Wilfred? Q. Elin. Call him? Ay; he has a throat [Exit Beatrix. That's loud, and shame must have a trumpeter, Or never march at all. [Re-enter Beatrix with Wilfred.] [To Wilfred.] The Kings's in loveâ With you or me? Wil. Nay, 'tis a snooded girl Down i' the country, coloured like a rose. I burn as hell to speak itâhow they kissed And hung togetherâ Beat. Mercy! Wil. In a woodâ He pressed her to his heart with panting voice That out-ran language. Beat. And the little wretch? Wil. Was eager as a devil. Beat. Fie, I'm sick Of horror and disgust. Q. Elin. Thank God for boys! To have reared a treasonous brood from his own blood, To have it at my call! John laughs in 's face; 'Tis a fierce pup My first; he'll fasten where I bid, relax When Death or I cry Loose; Oh, I am glad To have the record of those ancient moods Writ clear In my boys' faces. That first ecstasy Of anger, then the weak drift of despair In puling Godfrey. From a fire of tears Leapt out my Lion-heart! When I again conceived, my flesh was cold, I bred a coward! [To Wilfred.] Come, a covenant; Join hands! . . . My Beatrix, I toss her, a bright posy from my breast, The day, the very hour, I've smoothed her limbs. This . . . Let me loose on her! . . . Speak fast! Direct me! I have sown i' my sons The whirlwind of my nature; he will reap. This doe of the forestâmy peculiar preyâ With silver-arrow'd death she must be pierced; The wrongÃ¨d Dian must behold her bleed! I have not shared the King's love o' the chase; It 'gins to stir in me. [Enter Henry.] My lord, these twain Have kept me all the morning with their loves. Will you not bless them? K. Hen. Love alone can bless: Not kings.âSir knight, Be merry. Of twain studies one must be For ease, one for attainment. You'll pass days Too strenuous at task with life and love. Love therefore as a pastime,âthis fair dame Your mistress of the revels. Joy to each! [Exeunt Beatrix and Wilfred. Q. Elin. A pastime! From experience you speak? K. Hen. I never have concerned myself with love. Where's John? Q. Elin. Why with his retinue of fools. Best set an ape Before base things, since whatso'er he sees Must fall a prey To the antics of his visage. Do you need One to make mock of majesty? K. Hen. The boy, Where is he? Tell me where. O Elinor, Consider: you have Henry, the young king, To dote on; grant this favour to mine age, Let be our youngest boyâleave the soft wax Of's heart unimpressed by your virulence. He calls me âfather,ââI who bear an old Usurper's aspect to your fiery three, Plant not your poison in him. Q. Elin. With my milk He sucked it. The soft-browed deceptive lad You munch with kissing dogs his brothers' heels And licks allegiance to them. You're disgraced Suing for love as humbly on your knees As once for pardon at your Becket's tomb. A piteous whine!ââLove me, my little son, Or heart will burstââa sorry spectacle! I have a king to dote onâa young king! I tell you to your face, that boy of ours Crowned Henry has my love, because he has My bridegroom's eyes;âbut for the rest, my lord, You're old to think of love: when you were young You thought not of it. K. Hen. I embraced your lands, Not you. Q. Elin. Plantagenet, you wronged yourself As you had made the day and night your foe, And roused The violated seasons to confer Each his peculiar catastrophe Of death or pestilenceâEmbraced my lands! I'll shatter you As Nature shattersâyou, as impotent As the uprooted tree to lash the earth That flings its griping roots out to the air. And plants it burgeoned summits in the soil. Embraced my lands!âAh, I forget myselfâ The loveless are insensate to presage;â 'Tis in calamity's harsh stubble-field, They learn to suffer. I'll be harvester, And sickle your ripe joys. Embraced my lands! Had you embraced me, I had borne you fruit Of soft-fleshed children. Hug the progeny Of your stony lust, and curse me! [Exit. K. Hen. She forgetsâ When she is gone,âdear bliss!âthe thought of her Lies not a stinking corpse about my heart. The loved or loathed may haunt us. Who oppress, Are mortal in remembrance: being past As sultry day that kept the air in bond, I can breathe free. How beautiful To have the mind a solitude for love! Mine's clamorous as a campâone silken tent Close-curtained, secret . . . Rosamond! [Enter Courtier. Cour. A man Would see you, sire,âa haggard, bright-eyed knave, With rapid tongue. K. Hen. I know him. Bring him in. [Exit Courtier. The architect [Re-enter Courtier with Mavis. We would be private. Go. [Exit Courtier. Mavis. 'Tis done, and this the eve of the fifth day. All ready. K. Hen. Come within. Yon door hath ears Of human shape. Be dumb! This very night I'll ride with Topaz to the Oxford woods. Come, follow! thou dost pant; I'll give thee wine. [Exeunt within. Scene IV. âWoodstock. Moonlight. Rosamund asleep under a beech-tree. Enter on the other side Michael. Mich. Ay, 'tis a fair nightâas much day as can be, only a bit dark i' the corners like. 'Tis warm, too, for a night o' Mayâwonderful soft and dry.âNow what is the dog a-snuffing at? Here, Blanche, here! We must stop for no game. . . . 'Tis late belike, an' the wenches are a-bed. [Enter King Henry behind the bushes.] K. Hen. Is't a hobgoblin, this black, crooked shape? The dog that snuffs about yon single drift Of snowy womanhood, a thing bewitched? I will protect her from all enmities. Stand! Mich. Robbers, robbers, robbers! I'm trapped; I've naught!âGod help! [Exit in flight. K. Hen. 'Tis only some belated peasant. There! He's gone.âShe sleeps as innocence, and I Her lion-shield. So youngâso still! O Sleep, Thou lover pressing closer while we live, Than any other bedfellow on earth, I'm jealous of thy hold on her dear limbs, Thy intimate warm clasp. Ah, but she dreams! Divine to watch The course of her dreams, and by the rising flush Mark the king's entrance. Soon as she awakes I'll worship her!âin worship's fiery clime Desire's a child audacious, innocent, And knows not it is naked. Sweet, so close, And I can let thee fondle with my shade! One kiss, the trembling whisper of a touch, And we're together! [Kisses her. Ros. Prison! No,âthere's air! O Henry! K. Hen. Love! Ros. You left me desolate, And in a prison. Still mine eyes are wet With their leave-taking tears. K. Hen. What, weep to-night, Your birthday? Rose, you are a woman now; You love the kingâhow much? Ros. The stars must count. K. Hen. You'd do me homage, Rose, Were you the lady of broad lands; what vows Shall I require of you who hold in fief My heart's wide realm? Ros. I give you of myself All, all there isâand for the rest, my love. K. Hen. And you will swear me over-lord of all The womanhood That Time's good sword shall win for you? Ros. Ay, all. How should I know That I am girl, or, if you'll have it so, With this May-moon rise woman, save for love? K. Hen. The moon [wrapping her in his cloak] For touching this white shoulder must be banned! Let's to the deeper woods! The nightingale! Dost hear that urgent note?âa thorny sigh, A prick sets bliss to bleed, desire too sharp For toleranceâa pang. Ros. I'm curious To learn what happens to the nightingales At daybreak. Henry, do their gurgling throats Stop like a torrent when it turns to rest Under green leaves? K. Hen. In the nest all grows still. I've built a fair bower-nest for thee, my bird, And there we'll mate. Come, 'tis a little deeper in the wood, And nearer to its heart. Ros. I love you here Where the beech is and the sun. I will not go Where I have never loved you. K. Hen. Ha! Not come? Who is it orders? God, with those clasped hands She's forging mail to keep me from her heart. You love me in the woods!âa summer love! You shall love me in the winter, in the world, Where'er I will; what pain I put you to. You shall not choose. Is this your loyalty? And you'll not go Where you have never loved me! In the camp, The palace, I can find no spot of life Where I have ânever loved.â Where'er I am Is Loveâthe famished child you will not feed. Come, come! Ah, Rose, you cannot know the pain! . . . If you'll not come, I'll burn the bower, ride off to the wars, Make havoc till I perish. Ros. It fulfils My dream.âYou shut me in a prison closeâ Henry, I cannot leave you; lead me home. [Exeunt. Scene V. âAnother part of the Wood. Moonlight. Enter Margery. Mar. O moon, I love to be afraid, an' see The elder-boughs all white, an' feel alone With my big fear of every bush. The says Will dance to-night, for all is blue and still; There's not a little wind runs from its hole To be a mouse among the trees.âGood Lord! There's the black yew I never pass, because I know 'tis dreadful underneathâI'll run! Yes, there's the stone! Yes, yesâan' there are they The honey-elves! [Lies, and watches the fairies dance and sing. Fairies. In the moony brake When we laugh and wake, And our dance begins, Violets hang their chins Fast asleepâ While we laugh and leap. Mar. The little wingy circle spins about So that I cannot see 'em in the gloom; They might be made o' spider's gossamer. Fairies. Woodbine-leaves above, Each a tiny dove, Roost upon the bare Winter stems, and there Peaceful clingâ While we shout and sing. Mar. They've jumped the bonfire glow-worm. Here they come! Soft! They will dance upon my hair as moss, And I'll not scratch my head for all their toes. Fairies. On the rooty earth Ferns of April's birth, Brown and closely furled, Doze like squirrels curled Warm and stillâ While we frisk our fill. Mar. Now I can see their scrimpÃ¨d kirtles green, And swinging beads of dew about their necks; They've not the pretty caps o' Midsummer, Poor midges,âonly cowslip-bells, o'er young, That fall at every jerk, an' dirty cups From acorns of last year. I'll make my tiny peakÃ¨d bonnets red, And see if they will pick 'em from the twigs. Fairies. Hark! our ears have caught Sound of breath and snort Near our beechen-tree, Mixing carelessly! Sprites away! Fly as if 'twere day! [Exeunt. Mar. They're gone! I heard a noise! Oh, oh, oh, oh! If it should come from underneath the yew! [Faints. [Enter Wilfred, leading his horse.] Wil. By Cupid! 'tis my nut-brown maid enacts The shrieking owl! I swore I'd find her here, Watching for silly spirits of the night, That never come at all. My simpleton, My comely rustic fool, to be cajoled, The pleasant way of forcing childishness. Words be my only violence to win A lusty little paramour. These churls Are hoodwinked by the language of the great. Each finger is an icicle to touch. I'll wrap her in my cloak, fold her in fur, Before I speak. She's a delicious heap. My cosset! Mar. [starting]. Rosie!âWhy, I'm not in bed! [Discovering Wilfred] Oh, Oh! [sobs] Wil. My pretty maid, you're in my arms, And I'm the knight to whom you told a tale Or elfin pranks beneath the elder-trees, Just on the strike of midnight. So I came To see among the fairies which is fairest, That I may give her gems and gold and love. I see her! Mar. Sir, . . . I think they skipt away . . . A moment back. Wil. But one was left behind. Mar. You only see some primroses. Wil. [aside]. 'Tis thus We win the city harlots; but to-night I'm ineffectual.â[Aloud] 'Tis melancholy Watching for pixies dressed in flow'ry bitsâ Not much to see, if seen; while in the town Are ladies trooping all in bodices Of scarlet, jewel-lighted, with their locks Caught in a golden web; and there they dance With knights unarmed and rustling in silk. Mar. It must be brave to be in town! Wil. This dress Is poorâit wants an edge of gold; the stuff Is coarsely woven. If you'd come to town, And let me love you, robes of red and white, With golden fleur-de-lis all over them, I'd give you, and a necklace of bright gold. Mar. It must be brave in town! Wil. Oh, but it is! Mar. I'd like to see it very much. Wil. And have A pretty dress of red? Mar. I've got a cloak At home. And this is my old dress. Wil. Poor wench! You'd like to have a necklace of bright gold? Mar. Yes, sir; I've only got a string of eggs. Wil. Kiss me? Mar. They've told me to be coy with men. Wil. With foresters and peasants, not with knights; You should do all a gentleman could ask. Mar. I'd rather not. Wil. Come, come! You have not learnt respect, and if you'd have A silken bodice, I must have a kiss. Mar. Silk! Wil. And with spangles on't.âMy bait has ta'en; The body's caught in raiment as a net.â Kiss me? Mar. I've never kissed a man before. Wil. Then try how nice it is. [Kisses her. Mar. I'd best go home. Wil. Nay, but the scarlet and the linen fine, The broidery of wedded gems and gold, The silken vest? Will you forget them all? Mar. I can't. Wil. Then will you come to town with me? Mar. Yeâs. Wil. Or I'll go, and you be left to wear Coarse clothing all your life, and have no play But watching leaves or pixies at their dance. Mar. I'll run home and put on my better frock. Wil. No; for we'll have you straightway dressed in white A-glow with lilies. Mar. Lilies o' the vale? Wil. Oh, something larger. There, another kiss. One, twoâshe cannot count them, so I'll take An unrestricted measure.âCome this way. [Exeunt. [Re-enter Fairies.] Fairies. Silence! on the ground Set the toadstools round, Of these mortals twain We to talk will deign, Grave and wise, Till the morning rise. Scene VI. âWithout the Labyrinth. Morning. Enter King Henry and Rosamund. K. Hen. Sweet Love, Here we must part. [Taking her hands. Oh, brave, unwedded hands, that wear the kiss Of troth-plight for their pledgeâa pretty bond! You have the royal seal of a king's lips At your free service ever. Ros. I am glad No woman ever spoke to me of love. It's pure Only from burning lips. K. Hen. [aside]. Her innocence Kept the flame golden! [Aloud] I have taught you well? My bonnie wood-bird, when I'm at the wars, I'll lie in my tent and think of the sweet throat Of the nightingale that swells for me. [Kissing her throat.] Again You turn? Home, sweeting, this is forwardness To stroke my curls and fondle me. We've done with parting, if you glisten so, Unpacking all your sweets before the eyes That must to fast. Ros. O Henry, could I lie In the green sunshine and sing soft all day The words o' the lute! The little wood-sorrel and strawberry leaves, I've smiled to see them twinkling with my tears, When I have cried for sound of horse's feet, And the woodpecker provoked me. K. Hen. What surprise To find my lady in her midmost bower, Loosing from silken fillet, knot by knot, That hair that measures, as I well believe, My royal stature! When you comb it out, As the rower from the sea strikes sudden light With his oar's motion, every crispÃ¨d tress Will shimmer into argent. I shall laugh To find you silver-haired. Now to my will. You've wedded a Plantagenet. Seven nights Keep watch in heaven. When your couch is touched With the first moonbeam, take it as a sign That night You lie not lonely. Ros. While I live alone Let me be free to gossip with the woods. K. Hen. My lady keeps her bower. Ros. What should you fear? K. Hen. Your father will be seeking you. Ros. My lord, You would not banish me from sight of him, My fond old foster-father? He'll ne'er know I slip away from him. I still must tend His gentle childishness, and to my state When the King rides his forests. K. Hen. Were it my dearest hound that thus let creep A minute 'twixt my word and bidding doneâ Ros. I cannot leave my father. He'll not eat If I dress not his food, and Margery So wild and negligent. . . . K. Hen. I'll order good Sir Topaz to procure [Enter Margery. All comforts for old Michael; trust me, Rose. Sweetheart, once more farewell. [Exit King. Ros. There's Margery; She'll tell me of my father. What! her cheeks Are peonies; she looks . . . Where have you been? Who tricked you in these gauds? Mar. [dancing]. A knight! all gold To his horse's knees. It's splendid! You're in white. How beautiful! But, sister, I've a man Gave me these pearls, and called 'em mistletoeâ A kiss for every one. He's taking me To London on a palfrey. [Stopping before Rosamund. Rosamund, Though I'm a child, he's making love to me; It's like you and the King. Ros. The King! O God! You've been asleep all night, at home? Mar. No, noâ With Sir Wilfred, and he promised me A frock all blue, with stars, and made me laugh. He'll after me; the palfrey had a stone In's foot, and while he pulled it out I peered, And something glistenedâthen I jumped down quick And saw . . . don't shudder. Rosie, do you live Inside? Why, it's a palace. He'll come soon. Just see, this scarf Is gayer than the kingcups. Ros. [aside]. A mere child Playing with fairies! Mar. Past the cherry-trees We rode: the moon was like a candle held To the little slit of light down in our room! Rosie, I cried to kiss you once, and heâ [Enter Sir Wilfred. He's comingâheld me firm, blew down my ear, âYou think none naughty but yourself, you elf! Your sister can play pranks. She sleeps to-night In a palace with the King.â Oh, but it's fine! Ros. [aside]. How can I save her? [Aloud.] Child, leave gambolling, They want to steal and kill you. Take my hand, [Catching her hand and turning to the labyrinth. Come, see the pretty palace. Sir Wil. [advancing]. Pardon me, That lady is my prize, if you're the king's. Your little foster-sister has an eye Of an enchanting wildness. In attire Becoming that brave skin. . . . Ros. [gathering Margery in her arms]. Sweet Margery! Oh, do not look at him. Love, hide your eyes In my bosom; hush! [To Wilfred. You shall not touch the child. The Kingâhis name shall shield her. Sir Wil. Ay, You bear it proudly. You're his mistressâso! Queen Elinor shall hear of this. Mar. [looking up]. Rose, Rose! Do you not want me go and see the streets, And wear grand jewels? I will stay with you. Don't sob so 'gainst my heart. Ros. Ill keep the child. [To Margery. Sister is lonely; stay with her. Sir Wil. [to Margery]. You little fool, d'you hear? I'll fetch the Queen. She'll frighten you. And when she sees your sister here, who keeps The King away, she'll take her by the hair, And bind it round her till it chokes. Mar. No, no! She shall not come. Ros. You have betrayed the child. God curse you for't. Mar. Have I done wrong, dear Rose? Sir Wil. [to Rosamund]. Fair precedent You've given my audacity. The thing You call her ruin had been triumph if The actress were yourself; no more to her Than trick of a rash goblin. [To Margery.] Margery, You must with me; and if you're very good, I'll not blab of your sister. If you stay, I'll fetch the Queen To murder her by inches. Mar. [struggling from Rosamund]. Murder Rose! I'll strike her in the face. [To Rosamund.] He is my man, And I must follow him! Rose, you'll be safe, He'll not offend me. [Kisses her. Ros. [clasping her, and kneeling to Sir Wilfred]. For our Lady's sake, Leave this wild innocence to me.â I've sinned. She's torn Her frock in the briers, and laughs. Mar. [struggling]. I'll not with you, With my man! [Jumping into Wilfred's saddle. Good-bye. [Exeunt Sir Wilfred and Margery waving her hands. Ros. And I am bound to him, The King and my seducer! Oh, he loves,â It is not so he loves me!â Margery, He's hard and cruel; Margery, come back! Nothing to see But a trout leap in the stream. [Turns to the labyrinth. [Enter Sir Topaz.] Top. Mercy! if there are not folk about, and my lady outside the walls. Bless the pretty soul, she looks badly. There's been a summer shower on the two roses of her face. My dear damozel, I must lead you back 'Tis a strict command I have that you never stray from the door. There's a little garden within, where is broom and what not. Nay, look not so down-hearted. I've planted sunflower and sweet basil against the season. Ros. I'm so bewildered. Where in all this green Starts the way home? Top. Straight to the door, straight to the doorâthat is your home. Permit [takes her arm]. Ros. And will you never let me out again? Top. Nay, nay; you'll be very happy. And my dear monarch is so full of griefs, I'd rather lose a seat in heaven than put you in peril. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âWinchester. A terrace. Enter Queen Elinor, Wilfred, Jose, and Beatrix. Q. Elin. When, when? Wil. Not yet have Time and Circumstance Engendered their love-child Occasion. Have patience, O my Queen! Q. Elin. Patience and Queen! Thou fool, the words are mortal enemies, As much opposed as Strength and Impotence, Entreaty and Command. I am no queen Then, when I must be patient; royalty Allows no pause between the will and deed. Wil. Pardon! Beat. Yet God is patient. Q. Elin. What, my saint? Patient! God patient! Does He ever pause? Give me a poison-bowl to mix, a blade To try the edge ofâsomething to prepare. Jose. There's for your silver pious tongue! Beat. We're told God's patient with our wickedness. Q. Elin. What! lags In preparation?âputs away His wrath? Takes ease, as you would bid me now? You fools! He whets the hunger ere the sin be hatched Of the dragon that will tear it in our sight. He never waits! Jose [to Beat.]. Why were you not a nun? Wil. Because she's tender, and her shining self She'd never make foul weather of in black. Jose. Ha! ha! Beat. For shame! Wil. Nay, Mistress Beatrix, What were my loss! Beat. Then, sir, I'll take the veil.â Wil. Of bridal lawnâay, ay! Beat. You have me, sir, But you must learn to keep a sinless mouth; I'd have my husband irreproachable. Q. Elin. [aside]. To think of it!âat Woodstock!âand a home! He brought me to a place inherited; For her he's built this palace.âRosamund? Wil. The name? You have it right. Q. Elin. And planned the building.âWalk! Why should we stand? In pausing we grow cold. [They pace apart. [Enter King Henry]. K. Hen. Sons, sons! She'll dash the words against her mouth, As if to break 't to pieces. And she stirs A troop of boys, with tricks of horsemanship And set o' the lips that stamp her nuptial faith, To mad rebellion. Would she murder them? She is a desperate woman! Sick at heart Of all her wrath, passing yon twines of rose, My wont, I tore a handful of the flowers, Black, splendid, half malignant as it seemed, To throw into her lap,âa gift for queensâ My first to her, coiled sleeping on her couch. When presently she woke, she took the flowers And sobbed, âA happy dream!âthe sweet warm scent!â For the king kissed me close, and called me Rose;â Then tossed them from her with a stormy hand. I heard her singing her ProvenÃ§al songs For an hour afterwards. Can she suspect? I dare not try to soften her. She smiles At a deprecating wordâas the sword smiles In blades of finest temper. I must keep My majesty.âWhat news? [Enter Messenger. Mess. A letter, sire, From the third prince, your son. K. Hen. Ah! give it me. [Reads. Death-warrant to my heart!â A call to Aquitaine. O Rosamund! I'll bear the news myself. He asks my help. [To Mess.] Hence, and be entertained. [Advances to Elinor.] What! rebel too, My tongue!âRead this. Q. Elin. News from the children? K. Hen. Ay Your progeny, in arms, war each with each, In most unnatural combat. Our chief son Presses back Richard to the ocean's point, Who prays for help we'll grant him speedily Whom favour you? Q. Elin. Who bears thy name and face Is my prime warrior. K. Hen. You'd greet me, how, If I returned a conqueror? Q. Elin. With shrieks, A spectre's welcome. K. Hen. What, that's darkly said. I'll never slay the first-born of my loins For all his bitter disobedience. I trust you with the guidance of my realm: Be ready for all chance; leave not the gates Of Winchester. My Queen, the man in you Will keep my honour safe, while I chastise Our rebel offspring. You, good gentlemen, Keep revel as our land were not distraught. I may not tarry longer. Elinor, Pray, not as wife or mother; pray for peace To our divided hearts. Farewell! [Exit. Wil. 'Tis come! The moment's ripeâ Q. Elin. For vengeance and the deed! Wil. [to Beat.] My Fair, you shudder at the thought of blood. We've work to do. Braid me that favour, sweet; You promised, and I crave. Beat. Nay, I'll to church. [Exit. Wil. And there we'll meet.âI only know one way To get the door unlocked. Q. Elin. None but ourself Must murder her. Oh, I am blind with hate! You'll lead me by the hand? I could not catch The thread o' the maze. Wil. I say there is a way. Her foster-sister lives within my house, A common wenchâbut thus she'll serve our turn. She shall be taken to her father's hutâ (He'll have her back; they're grossly lenient, These peasants, in such matters)âwhich is near To Woodstock and the sylvan labyrinth. There shall she seek her sister, there grow dear To jovial Topaz in his lonely hours. And thus her voice will be our key; to us He'll double bar the door. [To Jose]. She does not mark. [To Elin.]. Listen, at Woodstock I prepare the toils. [To Jose]. Attend the Queen, till at a sign from me You draw her to the precincts of the maze. Give her a gipsy's dress, and thus equipped Yourself, await the doing of the deed, With ready horses, just outside the wood. I will attend her at the beldam's cot Down by the brookâyou know itâto the right; There shall the poison brew. Jose. And how long hence? Wil. I fear me some few weeks, or even more, To make all straight. But stay you till I send. The king belike will not return for months. Jose. I'll off to help you. Wil. Look! she's throttling her. Jose. Ah, truly! Speak and soothe. [Exit. Wil. Dear Queen, adieu. Have patience; you must feign a sickness. Q. Elin. Yes! Something at last to do. Wil. I'll straight prepare My piece of goods for travel. [Exit. Q. Elin. If he die In France, two lovers will be gay in heaven, And I on earth in hell. He must not die; I must watch work in him the injury. When God would hurt, He turns the heart adrift To cut itself alive among the tombs, And sets not corpse to corpse;âhe must not die! Scene II. âWinchester: outside a chapel; Margery sitting on a tombstone. Mar. He called me harlotâwould not stay at home, But left the house just as the wretched moon Fainted away, and everything was wet. [Enter Wilfred and Beatrix.] 'Tis he! I'll go toâno, I cannot; oh, good saints, I cannot! Who's that he's a-talking to? She's better dressed than me, an' white o' skin. Oh me! Wil. [to Beat.]. Why go to church so oft? Beat. Because, Sir Wilfred, 'tis the dormitory Of souls that find their pillow on sweet prayer. The want is frequent. Wil. Marry! while you kneel, Love has to play the monk. Beat. Sir Wilfred, fie! I fear you're not religious. Wil. I'm in love! Beat. And love is half religion. Wil. Lovely saint! Beat. Oh fie, Sir Wilfred! Wil. Lovely angel! Beat. Peace Wil. 'S death! then lovely woman! Beat. Nay, for shame, You're full of oaths. Wil. Just stop them with a kiss. Beat. Nay, not in public, by my modesty; A girl is watching us! Wil. Ohâah! the slut! Our marriage day will never come methinks. Beat. It is Time's sluggard, as all glad days are That slowly from the curtained future rise, Unwilling to forsake the bed which Hope Has made with golden hands. Wil. I'm for the bed Dressed by a grosser chamber-maid. [Exeunt. Mar. Alone! alone! I never felt alone I' the country; there was something loving me In all the green and everywhere about; But here I'm lonelyâlonelyâdesolate. There is no love for me in all the men, Nor in the streets they make. I cannot cry Because of loneliness, bacauseâ [Enter Jose.] Jose. Ho, wench! You want another woer. Look at me! What say you, Mopsy? Mar. Go away. Jose. Not yet. Why, hem! you're resting on a slab that boasts The unexampled virtue of its dame; She'll break it open with her finger-point, And mark you for perdition. Mar. Oh, good sir, I cannot read [rising]. Jose. Nay, never spoil the joke; Let's see your purse; your finery is dashed. Mar. No, no! Jose. Come, goose-cap, out with it. Mar. [beginning to cry]. 'Tis hereâkeep it. The fairies . . . I . . . [In bringing the purse out a bit of red stuff appears. Jose. Well, and what of them? Mar. The little cap . . . I began it . . . this this . . . O' my old red skirt . . . I . . . an' the little bodies . . . why, why . . . they've harebells nâow [sobs on her knees]. Jose. The dolt! Look here! 'tis gold, not silver, mind. Some weighty pieces. Come! Mar. I hate you! Jose. Strong! [Re-enter Wilfred.] Wil. Margie, old girl! Ho! brother, get away! [Aside.] She's yours hereafter. Come to me anon. Jose [To Mar.]. God bless you! [Exit Jose. Wil. Jewel, I have merry news. These cheeks are wan and dinted, ask for winds That blow across the fields. My turtle-dove, We'll to your home. Mar. Is it to cast me oft Because you take . . . a wife? Wil. Ha, jealousy! Why, baggage, bless your innocence, we wed Because we must. A wife, a wife! Forsooth! We look more sweet on minions such as you, Than on our proper spouses. Thus it is: I ride perforce to Oxford, and you wait The space of some few days till I return. At Woodstock there's a jolly squire who keeps Your foster-sister's bower. Margery, Seek him. His honest talk will spend the time If it hang heavy as a miser's purse. We'll start at dawn. Mar. You'll bring me back again? It is so still down there. Wil. Nay, never fear. Brave wench, a kiss! And now come home with me. [Exeunt. Scene III. âWinchester: An ante-room to the Queen's chamber. Curtain before the door. Enter maidens. 1st Maid. Since Lammas-tide Autumn hath lain about the doomÃ¨d woods. To-night she storms them, battering the leaves From many a stricken oak. 2nd Maid. And the wind waves The curtain to and fro. 3rd Maid. Is death behind? I know not which to fear, The ruffling night or the dead quietness Within. 2nd Maid. I'd like to peep. 3rd Maid. Thou dar'st not; none Enter save Beatrix. 2nd Maid. A cunning leech! 3rd Maid. Yet she Is colourless, and whimpers, âPray for us!â [Thunder. 2nd Maid. Hear you that? Should the king be afloat? 1st Maid. Impossible! His stoutest vessel cannot climb such waves, As must make mountain-country of the sea Betwixt his lands. 2nd Maid. 'Twas pity that the tales From Holy Land should keep him in the town After farewell. 3rd Maid. They say it fretted him. 2nd Maid. Peace, peace! The curtain moves. [Enter Beatrix.] All. How fares the Queen? Beat. She cannot sleep. Is the King still detained? 1st Maid. He left five hours ago. Beat. A fearful night! I cannot calm the Queen. Fetch me Sir Jose, He'll aid me; then to bed! 1st Maid. God lay the storm! [Exeunt. Scene IV. âWoodstock: Forester's hut. [Michael, laying faggots together for a fire.] Mich. There's no wenches. I can lay the faggots, and maybe stir a little flame . . . It's growing dark, . . . one might almost as well be underground; it's cold, and nothing to smile at. There's no wenches, and that means no broth. A dry crust's enough, without a child to break one's bread in the bowl and spice it. To think she could have done itâherâas white as the lily on the pond. But her mother was a slippery thing. Had she been as honest as fair, I had never had the hiding of her babe. And Sir Topaz must come with an air; how Blanche barked at him! âThe Lady Rosamund was well; the king had taken her under his protection; had I a message for her?â Well, I told him to mark how the dogs yelped at him, and be gone. The wood's green; it won't kindle. . . . . . . . . Mags was the faggot-gatherer, what a wench! They'd not 'tice her to mischief; she was shrewd; She milked the goat, and never lolled about; It's the lying on the grass that leads to sin, Snapping at flies. I kept Mags at my side; She knew the pups from their birth; she'd work to do Feeding and training 'em. 'Twas a soft hand Of Rose's, seemed to make you warm at once The way she led you in. She didn't talk; And it's a sign of honesty to talk. That sighing when there's nothing wrong looks ill Mag's eyes were wet two days for Blackberry; Rose stroked my headâshe didn't care for the cow; She hadn't got the sense; but Margeryâ A child to lean on that! just like yourself, With a temper you'd grown used toâknew the rash At sight, like measles, and could tackle it. Mags, Mags, what have they done with ye, my wench? The fire won't burn; I'll just lie down a bit. No, no; I'll try again To stir a flame. She may have lost her way, And look for the red light about the door. I'll try. Mar. [entering]. Dear father! Mich. [hugging Margery]. Hussy, clear the hearth! Where have you been, you naughty girl? Oh, stop . . . It takes my breath. . . . You wait Till after supper, and I'll beat you blue For straying in the woods. . . . Just tell me all. Wil. [advancing]. I found your daughter, Michael, in the glade Seven nights ago, as I was riding back To town, in haste, on business of the King's. I put her on my horse, and kept her safe In charge of gentle ladies, till to-night, When I restore her to you with the prayer You will not let her play among the elves. The woods are dense, her childish brain confused, And harm may happen. Mich. Thank you, sir. [To Margery.] Mags, since you've been away I've had no broth. Don't cry so; never mind! Look in my face! You must have seen fine folks, Fine ladies, in the city, were they kind? Mar. So kind! . . . O Wilfred, will you go away? Mich. You have not combed your hairâa ragged face! How is it you don't ask for her: âWhere's Rose?â Mar. O father, Rosie's safe; she's with the King, She'll be a lady; I may go sometimes And see her. Mich. This is not your woollen gown. Wil. Kind ladies gave it her. Mar. A lie, a lie! No ladies gave it me, it was yourself. Father, he promised me Fine clothes to make me wicked. Why, there's Blanche. Blanche, Blanche, you'll never know the difference. She smells too at my frock. [Jumping down and caressing the dog. Mich. [to Wilfred]. You took the hound I had no mind to part with; you took her And spoilt her for my use. I had two maids At my firesideâgood girls, And when I dozed at nights and woke again They seemed like angels watching me. Ah, Lord! I shall dream now of fiends. If I could lay My hands on her! Come here, now! Mar. [springing to him]. Let me stay; I dare not go with him. . . . A blow! . . . I thought 'Twas wicked men who loved you struck like that. Speak to me. Mich. Curse you. . . . Wil. He has lost his wits. Don't listen to him. Had you held your tongue, All had gone well. Here, call your dog and come. Mar. [to Wilfred]. No; I'll leave Blanche with father. [To Michael.] Every day I'll bring you faggots, lay them at the door. I do not want to stay; it's spoiled at home. How still my father looks. . . . Oh see, he sobs! Let me go back to him. [Struggling to escape from Sir Wilfred. Wilfred. He'll strike you dead. There now, you'll see! Mar. [breaking from Wilfred]. He's dead; he cannot strike. The sweet grey hair! Don't snuff so, Blanche. It's better to be dead; It's safe, like the high shelf I used to climb, Up out of reach. . . . How very thin His hands are! Wilfred. Poor Brownie! There, cheer up! Learn not to blab, And you shall live with Rosamund. Come, now, Kiss me; be good. Mar. Take me to Rosamund [Exeunt. Scene V. âWithin the Labyrinth. Enter Rosamund and Sir Topaz. Ros. He'd not have died . . . Top. I doubt it. I'm an old man myself. When death once claps you by the hand, you must go. Think not of that; think of the King! Belike he's coming through wind and rain. Ros. Fie on me, fie! Is not my father dead? And Margery . . . and yet the thing I want . . . Is the wind fluttering through the trees? . . . Top. 'Tis a wild night, but the wind cannot find you âso warm and close. Yet there's comfort; one can! The king will be here to-night. And I've taught you to play on the lute, and made you the lady you areâhis very queen and idol! Ros. He has a queen in Winchester. Top. Now don't wring your hands till they're like the flowers o' bindweed at the droop o' the day. Sit, sitâand I'll tell you of Dame Elinor. She's a woman of black eye and blacker soulâthat overflows in her birthsâ her children benighted from all goodness. She's a snake about the poor king's heart, and they the brood of vipers that sting it within. Ros. And he has never wronged her that she knows. Top. Nay, nay, never. All the hurt is with him. Oh, Lady Rosamund! I've known him stout and red, with face like a lamp and smiles that came out a'doors as if from home, and not from a dungeon. It's a woman's doing, the change. But you'll shake your tears off and comfort him. Keep your pretty face dry till he tells you of his broken heart. You may cry then. Why, I warrant he's here; I must to the bolts now. Hark! [Exit Topaz. Ros. Yes.âThe door moves; I hear the windâ Oh, I'm his leman, and I know not how Bad women feel; I cannot act the part. I am his Lady and his Love; it were A mistress's part to meet him with reproach. I'll be a rose for fragrance, not for thorn. Alas! when we were lovers, I ne'er asked What mood my love would like! He's coming! . . . [Enter King Henry.] K. Hen. Rose! Ros. O sweet, my lord! You're sick and weary. Keep the cloudy brow. Let us be sad together; I've heard say Green herbs are simple remedies, and so There may be cure in Rosamund for ills She wots not of. You're come to say Farewell! I'll bear it, love. K. Hen. God's truth, a Royal Rose! Though my young vultures famish for my blood, What matter! if my little Woodstock dove Coo for her missing mate in widowhood That tells where love lies bleeding. Ros. Nay, not so. I'll with you to the wars. K. Hen. My doughty Love! In the field's disposition, womanhood Is best in the rear. The soldier must not see In front the thing he loves; it would perplex; Imagination of it nerves his hand. You must not to the fieldâbut day and night You may besiege the skiey citadel; I will appoint you captain in that war. To arms, sweet lips, put off your peaceful use Of softest kisses, and in prayerful mail Equip you. But not yet. I'll keep this mouth That flowers against my cheek for purposes Most womanly. Shall women fast and pray? Oh, never in Love's sight; it is contempt Of his High Majesty. A fearfulness Possesses me that here you are not safe. I'll hide you deeper, you sweet-smelling Rose, For safety with my treasures; you shall have The custody of my imperilled crown. Ros. Think not of meâbut you, my dearest lord, Give me your griefs to think of when you're gone; They're dearer than your crown. You go to war . . K. Hen. With my own blood; and Elinorâ Ros. I would not see Dame Elinor . . . not look On that which bore you rebels. K. Hen. Ay, the boy Who made me father would unmake me king. Ros. May Heaven dishonour him! K. Hen. A royal lad! So princely! I have put the crown on's head, And smiled to see his brow confer a grace On the gold bauble. Be he covetous Of my grave, that territory shall be his; He will annex it briefly. Ros. Give me leave To dress my father's grave. I've played the part You feel the stabbing hurt of. . . . K. Hen. When I'm dead Haply the boy will grieve. Rose, have you lost Your foster-father? Ros. He died daughterless. I hate your rebel son! Go, strike him dead. There is a grave Where I will put my hand in Memory's, Listen her tales and bear the childishness That doth so oft repeat. K. Hen. I was mistaken babbling of my boy As you had been his mother. Ros. Rosamund Could not have borne a traitor. K. Hen. Ah, my sweet! If you had borne him, Henry's very selfâ The tiny portrait traced in flesh, with all A woman's delicate imaginings, Would have been dearer than the King, because It was the King and Love and Rosamund. Let us not wrangle: lovers wrangle thus, Young lovers, who can kiss again next day. We're parting; one of us, I think, will see the other once again. Ros. God help me! . . . K. Hen. Oh, parting is the mirror in Death's hand, Reflex of that immitigable face Whose glance for ever sunders! Ros. Dear, my lord, There are some thoughts That through this stormy weather of my soul, Cannot now travel toward you. Fare you well! K. Hen. What! Lightning in those eyes! A long, long rain Follows such storms! Farewell! [Exeunt Scene VI. âWithout the Labyrinth. [Enter Margery.] Mar. The country makes me shyâso shy! The trees O' the forest seem to stand aloofâstraight up, An' ask respect, like gentle folk in town. An' then . . . the flowers, somehow, are not kind; They only look at me . . . the marigolds! But they are in the gardens. . . . Yet I've stopped At every wild flower, . . . an' they only look. We were such cronies! Oh, it frightens me! This is the door; I'll very softly rap, Lest she should hear. I would not for the world Catch sight of her. . . . She would be haughty too. [Knocks. Top. [within]. Who's there? who's there? Master the Wind, ay?âthat's put a glove on his noisy hand to make a fool of me? [Looking through a window and then opening.] Bless us! Mar. Your honourâ Top. Indeed, good maiden, what would you? Mar. A basket for the ladyâwhortleberries; I gathered 'em this morning i' the dew; An' if you'd giveâ Top. Very pretty, very pretty! A fresh gift, but bad for the teeth, assuredly bad. Ho! ho! you've the sweet soot on your lips. Mar. 'Tis from my fingers, for I like them not. But RoâI thought . . . Top. A homely fruit! and you've set the sprigs about like nature. Well done! And pray where do you live, my pretty virgin, eh? Mar. With Mother Greene. Top. Odzookers! With Ellen Greene, the witch? a good girl like you! Why, she's got a black kitten that sucks her under the ear; and they sayâmercy on us!â'tis a devil. Mar. Oh, sir, but I have never seen it suck. It sits upon her shoulders with large eyes As yellow as the stars. Top. 'Tis Lucifer. Mar. She calls it Pretty. Top. My childâtut, tut! Why do you live in her stye? Bless my heart! Her company's vile. Mar. I have been left with her, and dare not go. It's better i' the day. But, oh! the dreaful night! I lie an' quake To hear the purrs and chuckles i' the dark, Or see the embers spring as green as wheat About a hellish pot! the room grows big And like a church at evening. Top. Oh, carry trefoil and pray, Ave Mary! That's a safe prayer. Rove the woods and be merry. 'Tis lonely hereabouts; but never fear! Maids have a watch. Keep at large, and come at your will to me. I've a cup inside, and a bit of honest talk will keep you from further witchcraft. Little sorceress! you've learnt the art as long as it's white and holy. Oh, oh! You set that gay bonnet like a sweet peaâall flaps. Did Mother Greene teach the charm? Nay, I see! A scholar to your own lesson, and very right! Nature has a pretty way of teaching girls. Why, my ladyâbless you! she puts a flower on her bosom as if to grow. Hist! that's her voice! Bring what the woods yield at your will. I'll give the berries to my lady. God be wi' you, lass! [Exit. Mar. It's like old times. He's natural, and does not seem to know, As the flowers do, and all the men in town. [Exit. Scene VII. âWoodstock: Witch's cottage. Enter Wilfred and Ellen Greene. Wil. It's getting late. Greene. An' full o' bats an' owls. Wil. Your time. Greene. 'Tis true, but later of an eve The fire is making yonder! [Goes apart. Wil. Margie's gone To catch old Topaz in her artless net Of prattle! 'Twas by very providence I visited the silly chuck at last. So many days and she had never moved One step toward the fulfilment of my plan. The hussy tires me with her drooping ways, The little Autumn! She's dispiriting, And makes me an old sinner with her sighs And yellow tinct. If Jose can make her dance, Twill be as the north wind, by savage play. What tall, gaunt woman's that across the path! A wolf, a prowling creature? Ah, the Queen! She has no patience. Q. Elin. Take me to the maze. See here the fire-tipped blade! Wil. Nay, you've mistook The time; our thread is Margery's young voice; E'en now she's making friends with the old man. To-morrow nightâ Greene [advancing]. Eh, are there two of us? Pardie, there's magic in the hem of the robe. Good faith! I tremble at her! Wil. Goodie, here! She needs a cupâthe poison I bespokeâ Against to-morrow eve. Greene. I've been to pluck The berries. Lack-a-day! I only played With wondersâfor a poor soul must not die! I frightened the young girls and got their pence. Why, sir, that lass of yours, this blessed eve She'll have a bath o' dew beneath the moon, To comfort her. Wil. Humph! devilish penitence! Greene. But, Lord! I ne'er have sold me to the fiend; Belike he's come to fetch me. Don't ye go. It must be secret.âKindly stay about, Good sir. Q. Elin. I cannot bide another night. My brain grows hot; 'twill scorch my sense. The king Returns a conqueror. She'll crown himâshe! Get access quickly. Ah, I fear my hand Can scarce strike steady. Get the poison mixed; My will is firm, and I can force her drink. Sir Wilfred, there's a heart to stop, ere night; The king is landing. Wil. I'll seek Margery; Watch you the draught a-brewing. I'll return. [Exit. [Q. Elin. flings herself on a bench. Greene. Beyond meâquite beyond meâa blue spirit That's smelt at sulphur. My poor cat is grey. Pretty! . . . There's a sort o' chains about the air. Lor! if I'm not afraid. Q. Elin. To do my will? Greene. What is it? Q. Elin. To make death. Greene. 'Twas once I sent A faithless lover pining to his doom. An' thus: I pinched a candle to his shape,â So like, it made ye start; and by the fire I kept it dropping. Q. Elin. Fill your caldronâcome! Greene. I'm shredding vipers' flesh. Q. Elin. I have a knife; I'll help. Greene. Is it a man you'd murder? Q. Elin. No; a girl. Greene. Bless us! D'ye see that flying thing with blood I' the trail of itâa shroud! and at the breastâ Q. Elin. Old crazy brain . . . her ghost will comfort me. Greene. Nay, to be haunted! Lady, look ye here! There's safer ways. I'll give ye this will make Any one love ye, and be mad for ye; Take that . . . Q. Elin. You can? Nay, nay, I must not be a fool;â Past that! Henceforth on hatred I must feed. To be hated more and more, and more to hate. What's that in the pot? Greene. It's henbane! Q. Elin. Wherefore cook Your wretched broth? This phial will suffice. [Snatching at phial. Greene. Not that, not that! It will not do the thing. Q. Elin. All's ready! . . . Ah, it presses inwardly, Like the full breast Undrained by thirsty lips. I've borne the load Of an unlonged-for heart; it stifles less Than the burthen of dammed hate! [Re-enter Wilfred with Margery.] Mar. Who's this? Q. Elin. I amâ Wil. Listen: this lady here Is Rose's mother. She was lost, you know; Now she is come again. She'll get you Rose Out of the maze. She wants to see her so; She can't be patient. Twenty years away! Mar. Oh, she looks poor and hungry. I am glad Sir Topaz said I might come any hour. Wil. Then you shall be our guide, and with your voice Call the good gentleman to let us in. Q. Elin. Give me this Rose, I say! Mar. I do not think She's gentle; may be she will strike at Rose. Wil. She's angry with the king, who shut her in. Q. Elin. [taking Margery firmly by the hand]. Go straight; I am her mother. Mar. Oh, I feel As there were thunder in her; I'm afraid! Scene VIII. âLabyrinth. Rosamund pacing the room. Clear moonlight. Ros. White moon, art thou the only visitant? Thou look'st like death! Dost glisten through the trees My Henry bows his plumes to in the gloom? He comes to-night; for good Sir Topaz said, âMy lady, put you on the crimson gown The king had wrought for you, and ask no more. But trust an old man's word. And be you ready.â It's a silver night; I'll put me out apparel. How blood red Burn the dark folds! I cannot put it on; And yet I will. My lute; what is't I wantâ God, or the King? [Sings. Love doth never know Why it is beloved, And to ask were treason; Let the wonder grow! Were its hopes removed, Were itself disproved. By cold reason, In its happy season Love would be beloved. [Laying down her lute. No; it hurts sharper. I must just sit down On the edge of the bed, and comb my hair and waitâ It can't be longâuntil the tide of tears Rises and fills The cracked and parchÃ¨d channels of my heart. I cannot think at all [letting fall her hair]. How beautiful This gold made silver in the moonlight. What! Would Heaven age me for my Love? Let's look In the mirror. Rosamund, you're worshipful. [Starting back.] 'Tis thus, Even thus, he swore that he should come to me. His very words! The prophecy's fulfilled,â I'll comb my hair down to my very feet. A step!âmy heart, some patience. Henry, speak; Bid it take courage! [enter Elinor] God, the Queen! Q. Elin. The Queen, who'll give you access to your God; The wife, who'll doom the leman. Elinor Come to put bitter poison in the cup The King drinks deep of. Never tremble so: I'll do naught hastily. Give me your face To lay between mine hands, and drink my fill Of the rich beauty I must violate. Let's look in your face! Why, Death were yellow to The blanch of your lips. Do not mistake me, girl, I lay Dagger and cup at leisure for your use; I will not harm you. [Aside.] What a curl o' the lashâ A lovely coast-line to the hidden realm Of the eyes.âHave you thought of me these many days? Queen, wife, and mother, and the thing you are. Old age is heir Apparent to the majesty of Death, And thought of the impending royalty Softens the manners, and should awe the heart Of youthâthat churl of nature! Ros. I'll not stay For any prayers; only remove the siege Of your eyes from off my soul. I will repay The debt [stabbing herself]. This bloodâ An earnest of the red gold from my heartâ Take it . . . and do for my dead flesh the things A mother would entreat. [Dies. Q. Elin. Sooth to my will, and she died prettily, With tears on her cheek. Mar. [bursting in]. Where's Rosamund? Q. Elin. A play at hide and seek here in the maze. Warm!âat my feet. Mar. You've killed my sister; you're a murderess; And Sir Topaz murdered! Oh, he died so slow, I could not leave him. Rose! Wil. [entering]. My Queen, to horse! I hear The King's horn in the woods. The parchment's writ We'd make him reader of. Plantagenet Best spend his first wild fury on the dead. Quick, by this passage. Q. Elin. Would that I were here To chronicle his face! Give me your hand! This roof Will break my brow. I've made my lord A bridal bedâa royal recipe For slighted wives. In very sooth the neigh Of his horse! All's ready for him. [Exit. Mar. [kneeling by Rosamund's corpse]. Oh, what is it that sucks the air from the room? An' I dare not go back, for the sweet old man breathed hard. It's worse than the dark, and it stares so. I never minded Rose looking. . . . They use coin. I've got some pieces of the silver left. I'll do it before I'm wild. But I shouldn't like the money there when I die. No. My hand. She's looking softer now. She hadn't seen the Prince Jesus before! 'Tis a great way above [raising her head at the sound of footsteps]. O Rose, Rose! Now I'll see what they do when we're dead who say fine things to us. Wil. [re-entering]. You little fool! Come out; did I not bid you follow? Leave You here for witness, sooth! Gag up your mouth. Come [pausing before Rosamund]. Oh, a royal morsel! [Margery stabs him. Mar. 'Twas the look He gave At Rosamund's white breast. I'm used to it. He may look so at me! It trickles downâ The blood on his cheeksâand clots his curly hair, The big black curls. I can't have hurt him much! Wilfred! I love him, love him; be alive, And strike and curse me. I've so swart a skin, The yellow bruises hardly show; but heâ He's growing deadly white. Wil. [aside]. A wench's thrust, And mortal! Little drab! She'll do what I tell her, though. [Aloud.] I'll have you hanged, Do you hear, before the city? Men will hoot And jeer at you; and say, âA slut like that, To lay her hands upon a gentleman!â The king will have you hanged tight by your neck, Do you hear? till you are dead. Mar. Hush, hush, hush, hush! Don't bleed so fast, Wilfred! Oh, kill me first, I can't be hanged; Have you not strength to kill me? Wil. Reach that bowl. [She drinks. Don't stagger here to die; go further off! Mar. Oh, kiss me! . . . Do not die! . . . It's horrible, The cold inside. Wil. She's fallen in a heap. [Enter King. My brain's still sick From loss of blood, or here's a spectre king! How hoary pale! [The King enters staggering; stands silent before Rosamund's corpse.] King. Before the funeral the eyes are buried. Thy lipsâalready is the tender mouth A rosy marble to the memory Of all past kisses. Lovely portraiture! That young Desire beholding ages slow, And turns from with the dull pace of regret. Her luteâO God! there's life about the strings; Her spirit's touched it. [Looking round discovers Wilfred. Wil. [to Margery, who groans]. Peace! King [going to Wilfred]. Confess your lips, and for your soul I'll pray That God may damn it deeper every hour. Unkennel! Wil. Sire, that child, Suspecting me of Elinor's base deed (That's the Queen's scarf caught in your lady's dress), Struck at me with the yet warm-blooded sword; Now end. Mar. Stop, stop! This gentleman Is kind to me, he never did me harm. 'Twas the tall lady with the knife . . . and this [lifting the poison bowl]. Don't hang me, sir; if you'll wait a bit, I'll die. I drunk it off As he told me. Pretty, pretty Rosamund, I'd like To have seen her crowned. Give her a handsome tomb In the church, and bury me Out in the grass. I'm but a common girl, And she's a lady. [Dies. Wil. You've your paramour To answer for; I mine. I killed that wench For slashing at me! Like enough Your lady rent her body at command Of majesty; what will not ladies do For monarch's pleasure,âeh? King. What lips God sets To his chalice-cups of love! What drink He gives foul mouths! Is there comparison Betwixt our deeds? From this slain innocence I wince not; for I worshipped. YouâI swear By the lost childhood of that cheekâdefiled. Wil. We had our pleasure the forbidden way, Each after his own fashion. For the rest, I bleed to death; it's painless. King. You shall have A leech, a cunning one. My men shall bear Your body in a litter to your love, With word from me how honourable your hurt; And if she spurn you from her door, 'tis well; Or if she tend you with cold eyes. [Wilfred swoons.] He swoons. [Turning to Rosamund.] Heaven favours me, to give my Love A private audience. They have pulled about Our bower, sweet Rose; but there's a holy spot At Goddeshill, where, 'mid the sisterhood Of blessÃ¨d nuns, I'll rear a stately shrine. . . . What need? . . . Death's labyrinth None threads. Ah, Rosa Mundi! thou That wert to the king a tender sweet-brier rose, They've shed thy petals; all thy balmy leaves Lie crushed against my heart. And what regret? Without thee I had plunged for solitude I' the murk of hell; and without me, my Life, Thy spirit had ne'er worn love's purple robes. Let's cover thee [Wilfred stirs. From this base sight,â(My Sweet, how well thou know'st 'Tis the first time Lust hath breathed near thee!) cover thee, until, 'Fore God and all His glistering righteousness, I shall re-claim thee, body, ay, and soul.</field>
