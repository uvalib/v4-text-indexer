      <field name="fulltext">Aspice, PLAUTUS Quo pacto partes tutetur— Hor. Lib. II. Epist. 1.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The late Mr. Thornton, in his preface to the first volume of this translation, has been so explicit in his account of Plautus, and his manner of writing, that little is left for me to say on that subject. The loss of so good a scholar, so worthy a man, must ever be regretted by the publick in general, and by his friends in particular. Had he lived to have compleated his translation of all the Comedies of Plautus, I should never have entertained a thought of offering mine to the publick, as he has indeed with great truth mentioned in his preface. In the second edition of his translation, I inserted an advertisement concerning my intended prosecution of the work; and to that I beg leave The advertisement, referred to, is, for the sake of the purchasers of the second edition, inserted here, by way of note; and is as follows: To the READER. At the time the late Mr. Thornton advertised, that he was preparing for the press a translation of the Comedies of Plautus, I had myself translated several Comedies of that author into prose. These were The Aulularia, Rudens, Epidicus, Cistellaria, Mostellaria, Stichus, almost the whole of The Trinummus, with a small part of the Menæchmi. I had also made no inconsiderable progress in the Captivi, in the same kind of familiar blank verse which Mr. Colman had adopted in his deservedly admired translation of Terence, and Mr. Thornton intended in his of Plautus. This I communicated to him; who, after I had compleated the translation in the same manner, accepted of the Captivi with the notes, and printed it with his own translations, and that of the Mercator by Mr. Colman, in the first edition of this work. Had he lived to have continued it, he intended to have inserted in his next publication, my translation of the Mostellaria, which for that purpose was new written by me in the same kind of familiar blank verse, and put into his hands not long before his death. This second edition, in regard to the memory of my deceased friend, I have undertaken to revise and correct, the Mercator, by Mr. Colman, excepted. I have made no change in what Mr. Thornton had translated, a very few words only excepted, the alteration of which had been submitted to him, and approved of. I have also inserted in their proper places, the corrections mentioned in his table of Errata. In my own translation of the Captivi, some alterations have been made, I trust for the better; and some addition to the former notes, as well as some new ones, more fully to explain and illustrate the author. Among the papers of the deceased translator, have been found the first and second acts of the Menæchmi, with the Prologue; and the whole first act, with the first scene, and somewhat more of the second act of the Epidicus. These are put into my hands. And as the admirers of Plautus, by the unhappy loss of a gentleman, who had shewn himself in all respects equal to so difficult an undertaking, have been deprived of a continuation of the work by so able a hand, they are desired to accept of it from one much inferior; which I therefore propose to give the publick, preserving all that Mr. Thornton had left, and adding notes. RICHARD WARNER. Woodford Row, Essex, July 15, 1769. to refer the reader; adding only, in regard to Mr. Thornton, and applying to myself what Lucretius says, apostrophizing Epicurus as then living. Te sequor, O Graiæ gentis decus, inque tuis nunc Fixa pedum pono pressis vestigia signis, Non ita certandi cupidus, quam propter amorem Quod te imitari aveo. Quidenim contendat hirundo Cygnis? aut quidnam tremulis facere artubus hœdi Consimile in cursu possint, ac fortis equi vis— Lib. iii. V. 3. The chiefest glory of the Græcian state I strictly trace, willing to imitate, Not contradict!—For how can larks oppose The vigorous swan? They are unequal foes. Or how can tender kids with feeble force Contend in racing with the noble horse? Creech. It will be proper for me to acquaint the reader, from what sources I have drawn the notes; what assistances I have had from French translations, and from the favours of friends.— Besides what I have taken from the Delphin edition by M. De L'Oeuvre (whose text I have in general followed,) I have either extracted from, or else abridged the notes of Lambin, Taubman, and the Variorum, published by Gronovius. I have also had some assistance of the same sort from the notes of Marolles, Gueudeville, and Limiers, in their respective translations of this author into French. To the latter of whom I am obliged for the thought, and, in a great measure, for the execution of the analysis at the end of each act. To these I have added not a few notes of my own; and some that have been kindly communicated to me by particular friends; whose names, had I the liberty of mentioning, would add the greatest credit to the work. One worthy friend indeed, I have liberty to bring the reader acquainted with; the editor of Rhazes de Variolis et Morbillis in Arabic and Latin. This gentleman has kindly undertaken that small part of the Punic in the fifth Act of The Carthaginian, which M. Bochart had left unattempted. He has also very obligingly added notes to those scenes of the comedy where any Punic occurs, in support of his translation, which differs very considerably from that given by Mons. Petit. The Punic translated by the most learned M. Bochart, is extant in his own Phaleg. and from thence printed in many of the subsequent editions of Plautus; to which the reader is referred. These two volumes are offered to the publick in general, and to the admirers of Plautus in particular, with the utmost deference to their judgement and candour. If they are so fortunate as to meet with their approbation, and the translator shall be judged not absolutely to have failed in so arduous an undertaking, the remaining Comedies, four in number (which, with the fragments, will compleat all that is left of the author) are in great forwardness for the press; and shall be laid before the publick with all convenient speed.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, in Epidamnum, a city of Macedonia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Translated by the late Bonnell Thornton, Esq;PROLOGUE. Spectators;—first and foremost;—may all health And happiness attend both you and me! I bring you Plautus, with my tongue, not hand; Give him, I pray, a fair and gentle hearing. Now learn the argument, and lend attention: I'll be as brief as may be.—'Tis the way With poets in their comedies to feign The business pass'd at Athens, so that you May think it the more Græcian.—For our play, I'll not pretend the incidents to happen Where they do not: the argument is Græcian, And yet it is not Attic, but Sicilian.— So much by way of preface to our tale, Which now I'll deal out to you in full measure, Not as it were by bushels or by pecks, But pour before you the whole granary; So much am I inclined to tell the plot. There was a certain merchant, an old man, Of Syracuse. He had two sons were twins, So like in form and feature, that the nurse Could not distinguish them, who gave them suck, Nor ev'n the mother that had brought them forth, As one inform'd me, who had seen the children; Myself ne'er saw them, don't imagine it. When that the boys were sev'n years old, the father Freighted a vessel with much store of merchandize; Put one of them on board, and took the child Along with him to traffick at Tarentum, The other with his mother left at home. When they arrived there at this same Tarentum, It happen'd there were sports; and multitudes, As they are wont at shews, were got together. The child stray'd from his father in the croud. There chanc'd to be a certain merchant there, An Epidamnian, who pick'd up the boy, And bore him home with him to Epidamnum. The father, on the sad loss of his boy, Took it to heart most heavily, and died For grief of't, some days after, at Tarentum. When news of this affair was brought to Syracuse Unto the grandfather, how that the child Was stolen, and the father dead with grief, The good old man changes the other's name, So much he lov'd the one that had been stolen: Him that was left at home, he calls Menæchmus, Which was the other's name; and by the same The grandsire too was call'd; I do remember it More readily, for that I saw him cry'd. I now forewarn you, lest you err hereafter, Both the twin brothers bear the self-same name. Now must I foot it back to Epidamnum, That I may clear this matter up exactly. If any of you here have any business At Epidamnum you want done, speak out, You may command me;—but on this condition, Give me the money to defray the charges. He that don't give it, will be much mistaken; Much more mistaken will he be that does. But now am I return'd whence I set forth, Though yet I stand here in the self-same place. This Epidamnian, whom I spoke of, he Who stole that other boy, no children had Except his riches, therefore he adopts This stranger-boy, gave him a wife well-portioned, And makes him his sole heir, before he died. As he was haply going to the country, After an heavy rain, trying to ford A rapid river near unto the city, Th'rapid river rap'd him off his legs, And snatch'd him to destruction: a large fortune Fell to the youth, who now lives here: the other, Who dwells at Syracuse, is come to day To Epidamnum with a slave of his, In quest of his twin brother. Now this city [pointing to the scenes.] Is Epidamnum, while this play is acting; And when another shall be represented, 'Twill be another place; like as our company Are also wont to shift their characters. While the same player at one time is a pimp, And then a young gallant, an old curmudgeon, A poor man, rich man, parasite, or priest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter PENICULUS, the Parasite. Our young men call me dishclout, for this reason, Whene'er I eat, I wipe the tables clean. Now in my judgment they act foolishly, Who bind in chains their captives, and clap fetters Upon their run-away slaves: for if you heap Evil on evil to torment the wretch, The stronger his desire is to escape.— They'll free them from their chains by any means: Load them with gyves, they file away the door, Or knock the bolt out with a stone.—'Tis vain this: But would you keep a man from 'scaping from you, Be sure you chain him fast with meat and drink And tye him by the beak to a full table. Give him his fill, allow him meat and drink At pleasure, in abundance, every day; And I'll be sworn, although his crime be capital, He will not run away: you'll easily Secure him, while you bind him with these bonds. They're wondrous supple these same belly-bonds, The more you stretch them, they will bind the harder. For instance, I'm now going to Menæchmus, Most willingly I'm going to be bound, According to his sentence past upon me. Good soul! he's not content with giving us A bare support and meagre sustenance, But crams us even to satiety; Gives us, as 'twere, new life, when dead with hunger. O he's a rare physician: he's a youth Of lordly appetite; he treats most daintily, His table's bravely served; such heaps of dishes, You must stand on your couch to reach the top. Yet I've some days been absent from his house; Homely I've liv'd at home with my dear friends, For all I eat or buy is dear to me, Yet they desert the very friends that rais'd them. Now will I visit him: but the door opens: And see! Menæchmus' self is coming forth. SCENE II. Enter MENÆCHMUS of Epidamnum, with a robe, speaking to his wife within. Were you not good for nothing, were you not An ass, a stubborn ideot, what you see Displeas'd your husband, would displease you too. From this day forward, if you use me thus, I'll turn you out of doors, and send you back A widow to your father: for whenever I would go forth, you hold me, call me back, Ask where I'm going, what 'tis I'm about, And what's my business, what I want abroad. I've married sure some officer o'th'customs, I'm so examin'd—what I've done—what do— Too kindly you've been treated hitherto; I'll tell you how you shall be—Since I allow you Maids, jewels, cloaths, wool—Since you want for nothing, If you were wise, you'd dread the consequence, And cease to watch your husband. So, that you May watch me to some purpose, for your pains, I'll dine abroad now with some trull or other. Pen. (aside.) He means to gall his wife by what he says: But me he spites; for if he dine abroad, On me he recks his vengeance, not on her. Men. Epi. Victoria! by my tauntings, I at length Have driven her from the door.—Where, where are all The intriguing husbands? why do they delay To bring me gifts, and thank me for my prowess:— I've stol'n this robe here of my wife's, and mean To carry it to my mistress.—So we ought To trick these crafty husband-watching dames:— 'Tis a fair action, this of mine, 'tis right, 'Tis pleasant faith, and admirably carried. With plague enough, I've ta'en it from one plague To give it to another.—Thus I've gain'd A booty from the foe, without our loss. Pen. (aloud.) What portion of the booty's mine, young Sir? Men. Epi. Undone! I'm fall'n into an ambuscade. Pen. You've lighted on a safe-guard: never fear. Men. Epi. Who's that? Pen. 'Tis I. Men. Epi. O my most welcome friend, Save you. Pen. And you. Men. Epi. How fares it? Pen. Let me take My genius by the hand. Men. Epi. You could not come More opportune than now. Pen. It is my way: I know to hit each point and nick of time. Men. Epi. Shall I acquaint you with a saucy prank? Pen. Saucy? what cook has drest it? I shall know If he has marr'd it when I see the relicks. Men. Epi. Now prithee tell me, have you never seen The picture of an eagle bearing off Jove's Ganymede, or Venus with Adonis? Pen. Ay, many a time. But what are they to me? Men. Epi. Look at me.—Do I bear resemblance to them? Pen. What means that robe? Men. Epi. Say I'm a pleasant fellow. Pen. Where shall we dine? Men. Epi. Poh, say what I command you. Pen. Well then,—thou art a pleasant fellow. Men. Epi. What, Canst add nought of thy own? Pen. Yes, joyous fellow. Men. Epi. Proceed. Pen. Not I, i'faith, unless I know Why there's a falling out 'twixt you and Madam. I take great care to have this from yourself. Men. Epi. Tell me without the knowledge of my wife, Where shall we kill, where bury, time? Pen. Come, come; You say right; I will dig its grave: the day's Already half-expired. Men. Epi. 'Tis mere delay, Your chattering thus. Pen. Knock out my only eye, Menæchmus, if I speak one other word, But what you bid. Men. Epi. Draw hither from the door. Pen. I will. Men. Epi. Draw hither. Pen. Well. Men. Epi. Come quickly hither, Come from the lioness's den. Pen. 'Fore heav'n, You'd make a dext'rous charioteer. Men. Epi. Why so? Pen. You look behind you, lest your wife should follow. Men. Epi. What say you now? Pen. What say I?—what you will I say and unsay. Men. Were your nose to any thing, Could you not make a shrewd guess by the smell? Pen. Aye, surely: the whole college, Sir, of Augurs Have not so quick a scent at divination. Men. Epi. Come then, and smell this robe which I have here. What does it smell of? (holding it up.) won't you take it? Hey-day! Pen. A woman's garment should be smelt at top; The scent is else too strong for any nose. Men. Epi. Come, smell it here then, good Peniculus:— How you make faces at it! Pen. I can't help it. Men. Epi. What does it smell of? answer. Pen. It smells strong Of theft, of whore, and dinner. Men. Epi. I'm now going To carry it to my mistress, my Erotium: I'll bid her to provide a dinner for us,— For me, for you, and for herself: we'll there Carouse it till the morrow's morning star. Pen. O bravely spoken!—shall I knock? Men. Epi. You may.— Yet hold a while. Pen. The cup was just at hand; 'Tis now a thousand paces off. Men. Epi. Knock softly. Pen. Are you afraid the door is made of crockery? Men. Epi. Hold, prithee hold:—herself is coming forth. Pen. Oh, Sir, you look upon the sun: your eyes Are blinded with her brightness.— SCENE III. Enter EROTIUM. My Menæchmus! My love! good morrow! Pen. Won't you welcome me too? Erot. You rank not in the number of my friends. Pen. Yet treat me as a supernumerary. Men. Epi. We mean to pitch a field with you to-day. Erot. Aye, that we will. Men. Epi. And prove, with pitcher fill'd, Which is the mightier warriour at the bowl: Yourself shall be commander; you shall choose, Which you will pass the night with.—O my sweet, When I look on you, how I loath my wife! Ero. And yet you cannot chuse, but you must wrap you In some part of her gear.—Pray what is this? Men. Epi. A cast skin of my wife's to be slipt on By thee, my rose-bud. Erot. You've the readiest way To win preheminence in my affection, From all that pay me suit. Pen. Right harlot this! An harlot's sure to coax, whene'er she finds There's any thing to get.—If you had loved him, You would have bit his nose off by this time With slobbering.— Men. Epi. Take my cloak, Peniculus; For I must dedicate the spoils I've vow'd. Pen. Let's see't. Men. Epi. (putting on the robe) But prithee now, you'll afterwards Dance in your robe. Pen. I dance in't?— Men. Epi. You are mad. Pen. Are you or I most mad? Men. Epi. Well, if you won't, Then pull it off. I ran a mighty risk In stealing of this robe: in my mind truly Young Hercules ran not an equal hazard, when He spoil'd the bold Hippolita of her girdle. (giving the robe to Erotium.) Take it, since you alone of women living Suit your affection gently unto mine. True lovers should be thus disposed. Pen. Provided They would run headlong into beggary. Men. Epi. 'Tis not a year past, since it stood me in Four minæ for my wife. Pen. Four minæ then, By your account, are plainly gone for ever. Men. Epi. Know you what I would have you do? Erot. I know; And will take care according to your wish. Men. Epi. Let dinner be provided for us three; Send to the market for some dainty morsel, A gammon, some sow's kernels, a hog's cheek, Or sausages, or something of that kind, Which, when they're brought to table, may suggest A kite-like appetite:—about it strait. Erot. 'I faith I will. Men. Epi. We're going to the Forum, We shall be here directly: while 'tis dressing, We will amuse us with a whet i'th'interim. Erot. Come when you will, dear, all things shall be ready. Men. Epi. Quick, follow me. Pen. Yes, yes, I'll have an eye to you, Close at your heels, I warrant; I'll not lose you, Not for the wealth of all the gods. [Exeunt Menæchmus and Peniculus. Erot. Call forth The cook Cylindrus, bid him come this instant. SCENE IV. Enter CYLINDRUS. Erot. Take the hand-basket; and, d'ye mind? here are Three pieces for you,—you have hold of them. Cyl. I have. Ero. Go to the market and provide Enough for three; now let there be sufficient, And nought to spare. Cyl. What kind of guests, pray, are they? Ero. I, and Menæchmus, and his parasite. Cyl. Nay, there are ten then;—for the parasite Will lay about him equal to eight men. Erot. I've told you what's the number of our guests: You will provide accordingly. Cyl. I warrant. 'Tis drest already: you've but to sit down. Ero. You'll come back quickly. Cyl. I'll be here this instant. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This Act, translated by the late Bonnell Thornton, Esq;ACT II. SCENE I. Enter MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES, and MESSENIO, his Servant. MENÆCHMUS SOCICLES. No greater joy have voyagers, Messenio, Than, from the deep far off, to spy out land. Mess. To speak the truth, 'tis still a greater joy To find that land, when you arrive, your country. But wherefore come we now to Epidamnum? Must we go round each island like the sea? Men. Sos. I am in quest of my twin brother. Mess. Good now, When will there be an end of searching for him? This is the sixth year since we set about it; The Istrians, the Illyrians, the Massilians, The Spaniards, the whole Adriatic gulf, With farthest Greece, and each Italian coast, That the sea washes, have we travers'd round. Had we been looking for a needle, sure We should have found it long ago, if visible. So search we for a dead man 'mong the quick; For we had found him long ago, if living. Men. Sos. Would I could find out one, that might assure me Of his own knowledge, that my brother's dead! Then I'd forego my quest, not otherwise: But, while I live, I'll never spare my pains, Nor ever will desist from searching for him. How dear he's to my heart, too well I feel— Mess. You in a bull-rush seek a knot—'tis vain: Come, let's return; unless you mean to write A book of voyages. Men. Sos. No fine, subtle speeches, Or you shall pay for't. Don't be impertinent. None of your freedoms. Mess. By that single word I know, I am a slave: 'tis briefly said, Plainly, and fully:—yet I can't refrain From speaking.—Mind me, Sir!—Our purse, look here,— 'Tis light enough, 'twon't make us sweat: now verily,— If you return not home; when nothing's left, You'll chafe for this wild chase of your twin brother. As for the people here, these Epidamnians, They're errant debauchees, most potent drinkers; Cheats, parasites abound here; and they say Such wheedling harlotries are no where met with; And therefore is this place call'd Epidamnum, Because there's no one comes here, but says damn 'em. Men. Sos. I'll look to that: give me the purse. Mess. The purse? What would you do with it? Men. Sos. I've apprehensions 'Bout you, from what you said. Mess. What apprehensions? Men. Sos. Lest you should cry in Epidamnum, damn 'em. You are a mighty lover of the wenches: I'm cholerick, quite a madman when provok'd: Now when I have the cash in my own hands, 'Twill guard against two harms; you'll not offend: Nor I be angry with you. Mess. Take and keep it.— With all my soul.— SCENE II. CYLINDRUS entering. I've marketed most rarely, And to my mind: I warrant, I serve up A dainty dinner to the guests.—But hold— I see Menæchmus. Woe then to my back! The guests are walking here before the door, Ere I return from market.—I'll accost them. Save you, Menæchmus! Men. Sos. Save you! Do you know me? Cyl. No, to be sure! (ironically) Where are the other guests? Men. Sos. What guests do you mean? Cyl. Your Parasite. Men. Sos. My Parasite? Surely the man is mad. Mess. Now say, my master, Did I not tell you there were many cheats here? Men. Sos. Whom mean you by my Parasite? Cyl. Why, Dishclout. Mess. See, see,—I have him safe here in the wallet. Cyl. Menæchmus, you are come too soon to dinner: I am but now return'd from marketing. Men. Sos. What is the price, pray, of a hog for sacrifice? Cyl. A piece. Men. Sos. I'll give it: make a sacrifice At my expence; for sure you must be mad To cross a stranger thus, whoe'er you are. Cyl. I am Cylindrus: know you not my name? Men. Sos. Or Cylinder, or Cullender;—begone: I know you not, nor do I want to know you. Cyl. Your name's Menæchmus, that I know. Men. Sos. You talk As one that's in his senses, calling me Thus by my name. But where, pray, have you known me? Cyl. Where have I known you?—you, who have a wench here, Erotium, my mistress. Men. Sos. I have not, Nor know I who you are. Cyl. Not who I am? I, who so oft have handed you the cup, When you carous'd here. Mess. O that, I have nothing To break his head with! Men. Sos. How? you've handed me The cup? when till this day I never came To Epidamnum, never set my eyes on't. Cyl. Will you deny it? Men. Sos. Yes, I must deny it. Cyl. Don't you live yonder? Men. Sos. Plague upon their heads That live there! Cyl. Sure he's mad, to curse himself. Hark'ye, Menæchmus? Men. Sos. What say you? Cyl. If you would Take my advice, that piece you promised me, Buy a hog with it for yourself to sacrifice: For sure you are not in your perfect mind, To curse yourself. Men. Sos. Thou'rt mad.—vexatious fellow! Cyl. In this wise will he often jest with me: He's such a wag, he,—when his wife's not by. Men. Sos. Prithee now. Cyl. Prithee now, is this provision Sufficient, what you see here, for you three? Or would you have me to provide yet more, For you, your parasite and wench? Men. Sos. What wench, What parasite d'ye speak of? Mess. Rascal! what Provokes thee to molest him thus? Cyl. What business Hast thou with me? I know thee not: I'm talking To him I know. Mess. You are not in your senses. Cyl. I'll get these ready out of hand: [pointing to the provisions] then go not Far from the door. Would you ought further with me? Men. Sos. Go hang yourself. Cyl. Go you and seat yourself, While to the violence of Vulcan's rage I these oppose—I'll in, and let Erotium Know you are here, that she may fetch you in, Rather than you should saunter here without doors. [Cylindrus goes in.] SCENE III. MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES, and MESSENIO. MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES. So,—is he gone?—I find there is some truth In what you told me. Mess. Do but mind.—I fancy, Some harlot dwells here; so this crack-brain said Who went hence even now. Men. Sos. But I do marvel, How he should know my name. Mess. I'faith no wonder: This is the way of courtezans: they send Their lacqueys and their wenches to the port: If any foreign ship arrive, to ask Whose is it, what's its name? Then instantly They set themselves to work, they stick like glue. If they can lure some gull to their embraces, They turn him out anon, undone and ruin'd. A pirate vessel lurks within this port, Which we in my opinion should beware of. Men. Sos. You counsel right. Mess. It will be known at last How right it is, if you as rightly follow it. Men. Sos. Softly a while: the door creaks: let us see Who's coming forth. Mess. Mean while I'll lay this down; [lays down his wallet on some oars.] Pray keep it safe, ye water-treading oars. SCENE IV. Enter EROTIUM, speaking to her Servants within. Leave the door thus: I would not have it shut: Begone: make ready: see that ev'ry thing Be done that's wanting: lay the couches smooth, Let the perfumes be set on fire. 'Tis neatness Lures the fond lover's heart. A spruce appearance Is damage to the lover, gain to us. But where, where is he, whom the cook inform'd me Was at the door? I see him; he's a gentleman, From whom I draw much service and much profit; And therefore I'm content, that he should hold, As he deserves, with me, the highest place. I'll go and speak to him. My life! my soul! I marvel you should stand here at the door, That's open to you more than is your own; Your own it is.—Sweet, ev'ry thing is ready Which you desir'd: nothing to stay you, love: The dinner, which you order'd, we have got: Then, whensoe'er you please, you may sit down. Men. Sos. Whom does the woman speak to? Erot. Why, to you. Men. Sos. What business have I ever had with you? What business have I now? Erot. 'Tis Venus' will, I should prefer you before all my lovers; Nor on your part unmerited, for you, You only with your gifts enrich me. Men. Sos. Sure This woman's either mad or drunk, Messenio, Thus to accost a stranger so familiarly. Mess. Such practices are common here, I told you. These are but leaves; but if we tarry here Three days, the trees themselves will tumble on you. The courtezans here are all money-traps.— But suffer me to speak to her.—Hearkye, woman! A word with you. Erot. What is't? Mess. Where did you know This gentleman? Erot. Where he has long known me: In Epidamnum here. Mess. In Epidamnum? He never set his foot in't till to-day. Erot. Ah! you are pleas'd to joke, my dear Menæchmus. But prithee, sweet, come in; 'twere better for you. Men. Sos. 'Fore heav'n the woman calls me by my name. I marvel what this means. Mess. She smells the purse Which you have there— Men. Sos. That's rightly put in mind. Here, take it. I shall know now if her love's To me, or to the purse. Erot. Let's in to dinner. Men. Sos. 'Tis a kind invitation, and I thank you. Erot. Why did you bid me then to get a dinner? Men. Sos. I bid you get a dinner! Erot. Yes, most certainly, For you and for your parasite. Men. Sos. A plague! What parasite?—Why sure the woman's crazy. Erot. Peniculus. Men. Sos. Who's that Peniculus? Erot. The parasite; in other words, the Dishclout. Men. Sos. O, what they wipe their shoes with? Erot. He, I say, Who came with you this morning, when you brought me The robe that you had stolen from your wife. Men. Sos. How say you? I present you with a robe, That I had stolen from my wife? art mad? The woman sure, walks like a gelding, sleeping. Erot. Why are you pleas'd to hold me for your sport? And why do you deny what you have done? Men. Sos. What is it I deny? What have I done? Erot. Given me a robe belonging to your wife. Men. Sos. I still deny it: I never had a wife, Nor have I: neither have I set my foot Within your doors, since I was born. I din'd On ship-board, thence came hither, and here met you. Erot. Ah! woe is me!—what ship is't you are talking of? Men. Sos. A wooden one, oft weather-beaten, oft Bethump'd with mallets, like a taylor's pin-cushion Peg close to peg. Erot. I'prithee, now have done With jesting thus, and come along with me. Men. Sos. Some other man you mean, I know not whom, Not me. Erot. What! don't I know thee? not Menæchmus, The son of Moschus, who wert born, thou say'st, At Syracuse, in Sicily, where erst Reign'd king Agathocles, and after Pinthia, And next him Liparo, who by his death The kingdom left to Hiero, now king. Men. Sos. 'Faith what you say is true. Mess. O Jupiter! Is she not come from thence, so well she knows you? Men. Sos. I can hold out no longer. Mess. Stay, Sir, stay; For if you cross her threshold, you're undone. Men. Sos. Be quiet: all is well: I will assent To whatsoe'er she says, so I but get Good entertainment, and a fair reception. (To Erotium.) For some time wittingly I have oppos'd you, Fearing this fellow here, lest he should tell My wife concerning all—the robe and dinner: Now when you please, we'll enter. Erot. Then you do not Stay for the parasite? Men. Sos. I neither stay, Nor care a rush for him; nor would I have him Be let in when he comes. Erot. With all my heart.— But do you know, sweet, what I'd have you do? Men. Sos. Command me what you will. Erot. That robe you gave me. I'd have you carry it to the embroiderer's, To be made up anew; with such additions, As I shall order. Men. Sos. What you say is right: So will it not be known; nor will my wife, If she should see you with it in the street, Know you have got it. Erot. So then by and by, Sweet, you shall take it with you, when you go. Men. Sos. I will. Erot. Let's in now. Men. Sos. I'll attend you presently, I would just speak a word with him. [Erotium goes in.] SCENE V. MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES, MESSENIO. Men. Sos. Messenio! Come hither. Mess. What's the matter? Men. Sos. 'St!—shall I Impart it to you? Mess. What? Men. Sos. 'Tis such a chance. Mess. What chance? Men. Sos. I know what you will say. Mess. I say So much the worse for you. Men. Sos. I have got it, boy: I have already made a rare beginning. Quick as you can, go carry these my ship-mates Directly to some place of entertainment. Then come to me e'er sun-set. Mess. Master! master! You're unacquainted with these harlotries. Men. Sos. Peace, prithee. If I play the fool, 'tis I, Not you, shall suffer. Why, this woman here Is a mere simpleton, an arrant ignorant, As far as I have prov'd her hitherto.— She is our game, my boy. Mess. 'Tis over with us. Men. Sos. Will you be gone? Mess. He is undone, that's certain. This pirate vessel has the boat in tow. But I'm a fool, that I should seek to rule My master: for he bought me to obey, Not govern him. Come, follow me, that I May wait upon him at the time he order'd. Thus far, translated by the late Bonnell Thornton, Esq: [Exeunt.] End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter PENICULUS, the Parasite. I have seen thirty years and more, yet never Play'd I so foolish or so vile a trick As I have done this day, in mixing with The crowd in the assembly of the people. Where while I stood staring about, Menæchmus Gave me the slip, I fancy to his mistress; Nor took me with him.—Gods confound the man! First took it in his head, to institute These meetings to engage the most engag'd. 'Twere better only to elect the idle Who should be fin'd in case of non-attendance. There are enough who eat their meals alone; Who've nought to do, who nor invited are Nor e'er invite.—These were the men to hold Assemblies, and attend at the Comitia.— Had this been so, I had not lost my dinner, Which he'd as sure have giv'n me, as I live. I'll go however—Hope of the very scraps Comforts my mind—But see, Menæchmus comes From dinner, with a wreath—All's ta'en away, And I am come at a fine time indeed! SCENE II. Enter MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES with a robe. Men. Sos. If I return it neatly fitted up, [speaking to Erotium within.] So that you scarce shall know it is the same, And that this very day, shall you not then Be satisfied? Pen. [apart.] He's carrying the robe To the embroiderer's—And dinner's done— The wine drank off, and the poor parasite bilk'd, By Hercules! if I put up with this, And not revenge, I'm not the man I am. Let's first see what he'll do, and then accost him.— Men. Sos. Immortal Gods! is there a man on whom You've in one day bestow'd more good, or one Who less could hope for it? I've din'd, I've drank, I've feasted with my mistress, have born off This robe, which she no more shall call her own. Pen. [apart.] He speaks so softly, I can scarce distinguish What 'tis he says: sure, now his belly's full, He talks of me, and of my share at dinner. Men. Sos. She told me, I had given her the robe And that I'd stol'n it from my wife: tho' I Knew she was wrong, I seemingly assented To all her story, as if both of us Had been joint parties in the whole transaction. Said as she said—What need of many words? I never in my life have far'd so well, And at so small expence. Pen. I will accost him. I'm out of patience till I quarrel with him. Men. Sos. Who is it that is coming to accost me? Pen. Tell me, inconstant, lighter than a feather, Thou worst of men, most wicked of mankind, Base man, deceiver, void of faith and honour! Have I deserv'd this of thee? For what cause Hast thou undone me? Say, have I deserv'd, That thou should'st steal thyself away from me, Now at the Forum? Thou hast buried too The dinner in my absence, to the which I was joint heir—How dare you serve me thus? Men. Sos. Prithee, young man, what hast to do with me? Abusing thus a man thou dost not know— You'd have me wreak this insult then hereafter? Pen. You have done that already. Men. Sos. Answer me. Tell me your name, young man. Pen. Still mocking me? As if you did not know my name? Men. Sos. In troth, I know not till this day I ever saw thee, Nor art thou known to me, whoe'er thou art, It ill-becomes thee to be troublesome. Pen. Not know me? Men. Sos. If I did, I'd not deny it. Pen. Awake, Menæchmus. Men. Sos. 'Troth, I do not know, That I'm a-sleep. Pen. Not know your parasite? Men. Sos. Thy head is turn'd, young man, in my opinion. Pen. Answer me, did you not this very day, Steal from your wife that robe, and give't Erotium? Men. Sos. Neither have I a wife, nor robe have stol'n, Nor given to Erotium. Pen. Are you mad? Have you your senses? Why the thing's apparent! Did I not see you coming from the house, The robe upon you? Men. Sos. Woe upon thy head! 'Cause you're a rogue, think you we all are such? Say you, you saw me with this robe upon me? Pen. I did, by Hercules! Men. Sos. Go, and be hang'd As you deserve, or else go purge your brain; For thou'rt the veriest madman I e'er met with. Pen. By Pollux' temple, nothing shall prevent me, From telling to your wife, the whole that's pass'd. And then shall all this scurril wit retort Back on yourself. Nor shall you unreveng'd Have swallow'd down my dinner. Men. Sos. What is this? Shall ev'ry one I see, affront me thus? But see, the door is opening.— SCENE III. Enter a MAID SERVANT of Erotium, with a clasp. Serv. Erotium Most earnestly entreats of her Menæchmus, ('Twill make it but one trouble,) to bear this To the goldsmith, with her orders, that he add An ounce more gold, and have it clean'd and mended. Men. Sos. This, and ought else that she would have me do, Tell her I will take care to execute. Serv. But, do you know the clasp I'm speaking of? Men. Sos. I know it not; but see 'tis made of gold. Serv. 'Tis that, which sometime since, you said you stole And privately, from your wife's chest of drawers. Men. Sos. That's what I never did, by Hercules! Serv. What, don't you recollect it? then, return it. Men. Sos. Stay: I begin to recollect: it was The same I gave your mistress. Serv. Yes, the same. Men. Sos. Where are the bracelets which I gave with it? Serv. You never gave them. Men. Sos. But I did, by Pollux! And gave them both together. Serv. Shall I say, You will take care— Men. Sos. Yes; and the robe and clasp Shall be return'd together— Serv. Let me, Sir, Beg you'd present me with a pair of ear-rings Of gold, and of two pieces value; that I may Look well upon you, when you pay your visits. Men. Sos. It shall be done: give me the gold; I'll pay Myself the fashion. Serv. No, I pray you, Sir, Give it yourself, I'll be accountable. Men. Sos. I say, give me the gold— Serv. Another time. I'll pay it back two-fold. Men. Sos. I have no money. Serv. But when you have, you'll pay the jeweller. Any commands with me? Men. Sos. Yes, tell your mistress I'll take great care of what she has order'd me— [Exit Servant.] Yes, soon as may be, I'll take care to sell them [aside.] To the best bidder.—Is she now gone in? She is, and shut the door. Sure all the gods Befriend me, and heap favour upon favour. Why do I stay when time and opportunity Thus favours me in quitting this vile place, This place of bawds and panders? Haste thee, Menæchmus, then; use well thy feet, And mend thy pace. Let me take off my wreath, And throw it to the left: that, if I'm follow'd, They may suppose, I'm gone that way. I'll now Find, if I can, my servant, and acquaint him With what the gods are doing in my favour— [Exit. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter the WIFE of Menæchmus of Epidamnum, and PENICULUS, the Parasite. WIFE. And shall I tamely then submit to live In marriage with a man, who filches from me Whatever's in the house, and bears it off A present to his mistress? Pen. Hold your peace: I will so order matters, that you shall Surprize him in the fact. So follow me. Crown'd with a wreath, and drunk, he bore away The robe that he filch'd from you yesterday, To the embroiderer's. But see, the wreath, The very wreath he wore—Is it not true? [seeing the wreath on the ground.] He's gone this way; and you may trace his steps. And see, by Pollux' temple, he returns, And opportunely; but without the robe. Wife. How shall I treat him now? Pen. How? Why as usual, Most heartily abuse him. Wife. Yes, I think so— Pen. Let's stand aside, and watch him from our ambush. [they retire. SCENE II. Enter MENÆCHMUS of Epidamnum. Men. Epi. How troublesome it is, thus to indulge Ourselves in foolish customs! yet the great, Those petty gods, too much come into it. All wish to have a number of dependents, But little care whether they're good or bad. Their riches, not their qualities, they mind. Honest and poor is bad.—Wicked and rich, An honest man.—Clients, that have regard To neither law, nor common honesty, Weary their patrons—Leave them a deposit, They will deny the trust—Litigious, Covetous, fraudulent, who've got their wealth By usury or perjury—Their soul's Still in their suits—A summons for defence Once issu'd, 'tis their patron's summons too; Who 'fore the people, prætor, commissary, Must speak in their behalf, however wrong. Thus was I plagu'd to-day by a dependant, One of this sort, who would not let me do Aught which I wanted in my own affairs; Holding me close to his, he so detain'd me— When I had battled for him 'fore the Ædiles, With craft had pleaded his bad cause, had brought To hard conditions his opponent, nay Had more or less perplex'd the controversy, And brought it e'en to making their deposits: What does he do?—Why gives in bail—I never Saw in all my life a villain more barefac'd In all respects.—Three witnesses swore plumb, And prov'd against him every accusation. The gods confound him! for thus making me Lose all my time: ay, and confound myself, For having seen the Forum with these eyes! The noblest day is lost: a dinner's order'd; My mistress waits.—I know it, and as soon As e'er I could, I've hast'ned from the Forum. Doubtless she's angry with me; but the robe Filch'd from my wife to-day, and sent to her, Shall make all up. Pen. What say you now? Wife. Unhappy! In having such a husband.— Pen. Did you hear Distinctly what he said? Wife. Very distinctly. Men. Epi. I shall do right, if I go in directly And here refresh myself. Wife. Wait but a little, And I'll refresh you better. [to him.] You shall pay; Yes, that you shall, by Castor! and with interest, For that you filch'd from me, you've thus your due. What, did you fancy you could play such tricks In secret? Men. Epi. What's the business, wife? Wife. Ask that Of me? Men. Epi. Why, would you that I ask of him? Pen. No soothing now. Go on. Men. Epi. Say, why so pensive? Wife. You can't but know the reason— Pen. Yes, he knows, But cunningly dissembles. Men. Epi. What's the matter? Wife. The robe.— Men. Epi. The robe? what— Wife. Ay, the robe.— Pen. Why pale? Men. Epi. I pale! unless the paleness of the robe Has made me so. Pen. I too am pale, because You eat the supper, and ne'er thought of me. To him again. [to the Wife.] Men. Epi. Won't you be silent? Pen. No. He nods to me to hold my tongue. [to the wife.] Men. Epi. Not I, By Hercules! I neither wink'd nor nodded. Wife. I'm an unhappy woman! Men. Epi. Why unhappy? Explain.— Pen. A rare assurance, that denies What yourself sees.— Men. Epi. By Jove, and all the gods! I nodded not—Are you now satisfied? Pen. And to be sure, she now will give you credit. Go back again— Men. Epi. And whither? Pen. Whither else But to th'embroiderer—Beyond all doubt I think you ought—Go, and bring back the robe— Men. Epi. What robe do you speak of? Wife. Since he don't remember What he has done, I have no more to say. Men. Epi. Has any of the servants been in fault? Has any of the men or women slaves Given you a saucy answer?—Say, speak out, He shall not go unpunish'd. Wife. Sure, you trifle. Men. Epi. You're out of humour: that I'm not quite pleas'd with. Wife. You trifle still. Men. Epi. Has any of the family Done ought to make you angry? Wife. Trifling still. Men. Epi. Angry with me then—. Wife. Now you trifle not. Men. Epi. 'Troth I've done nothing to deserve it of you. Wife. Trifling again. Men. Epi. What is it gives you pain? Tell me, my dear. Pen. He sooths you: civil creature! Men. Epi. Can't you be quiet? I don't speak to you. [to Peniculus.] Wife. Off with your hand. Pen. Ay, thus you're rightly serv'd—[aside.] Dine then again in hast when I am absent! And rally me before the house when drunk! A wreath too, on your head! Men. Epi. By Pollux' temple! I have not din'd to-day, nor have I once Set foot within the house. Pen. You dare deny it? Men. Epi. I do, by Hercules! Pen. Consummate impudence? Did I not see you with a wreath of flowers, Standing before the house here; when you said My head was turn'd: when you denied you knew me, And when you'd pass upon me for a stranger? Men. Epi. I do assure you, since I slip'd away This morning from you, I've not been till now At home. Pen. I know you, Sir: but you knew not I'd wherewithal to take revenge upon you. I've told your wife the whole, by Hercules! Men. Epi. What have you told? Pen. I know not. Ask of her. Men. Epi. What's this, my dear? What is it he has told you? You answer not—Why don't you say what 'tis? Wife. As if you know not. Why, a robe has been Stol'n from me in my house. Men. Epi. A robe stol'n from you? Wife. Do you ask me? Men. Epi. In troth, I scarce should ask it, Was I assur'd it was so.— Pen. Wicked man! How he dissembles! but you can't conceal it, I know the whole affair; and I have told it All to your wife. Men. Epi. What is all this about? Wife. Since you have lost all shame, and won't confess The thing yourself, hearken to me, and hear it; I'll tell you what has made me out of humour, And every thing he has discover'd to me. They have done well for me, they've stol'n my robe. Men. Epi. Done well for you by stealing of your robe! Pen. Observe his subterfuge: 'twas stol'n for her, [meaning Erotium.] And not for you: Had it been stol'n for you, It had been safe. Men. Epi. I've nought to do with you. But what say you? [to his wife.] Wife. I say, I've lost from home A robe. Men. Epi. Who took it? Wife. He who stole it, knows. Men. Epi. And who is he? Wife. One who is call'd Menæchmus. Men. Epi. Spitefully done! And who is this Menæchmus? Wife. Yourself, I say. Men. Epi. What! I? Wife. Yes, you. Men. Epi. Who said so? Wife. My self. Pen. And I; and that you had carried it Off to your mistress, to Erotium. Men. Epi. I? I give it her? Pen. You, you, I say. Shall I Go fetch an owl, to hoot in at your ears, You, you? for we are both quite tir'd. Men. Epi. By Jove, and all the gods, I swear, my dear, I never gave it her: Will that content you? Pen. And I, I swear by Hercules! that we Say nought but truth. Men. Epi. I did not give it her, I only lent it. Wife. 'Troth, I never lend Your coat, nor cloak abroad. 'Tis right for women To lend out women's garments; men, their own. Won't you return my robe? Men. Epi. The robe, I'll see Shall be return'd— Wife. 'Tis the best way.—For you Shall never set a foot within your doors, Unless you bring my robe. Men. Epi. Not set a foot Within my doors? Pen. [to the Wife.] What recompence for me, Who have assisted you? Wife. When you have had A loss like mine, I'll do the same for you. Pen. By Pollux' temple that will never be; For I have nought at home to lose. The gods Confound you both, both of you, wife and husband! I'll hie me to the Forum: for I find 'Tis now quite over with me in this family. [Exeunt Peniculus and the Wife, severally. Men. Epi. My Wife then thought she'd done a mighty matter, In threatning thus, to shut me out of doors; As if I had not a far better place, Where I shall be admitted. Well, if I Displease you, my dear wife, I must e'en bear it: But I shall please Erotium; and she ne'er Will shut me out, but rather shut me in. Well, I'll go in, and pray her to return The robe I just now gave her, and instead Of that, I'll purchase her a better. Ho! Who's porter here? Open the door, and call Erotium hither. SCENE III. Enter EROTIUM. Erot. Who inquires for me? Men. Epi. 'Tis one, who to himself is more an enemy, Than such to you. Erot. My dear Menæchmus, why Do'st stand before the door? Follow me in. Men. Epi. Stay here a little. Do you know the reason I now come to you? Erot. I know it very well: 'Tis to amuse yourself along with me. Men. Epi. That robe I lately gave you, prithee, love, Restore it.—For my wife hath been appris'd, And knows the whole affair from first to last. I'll buy one for you twice as rich, you'll like— Erot. I gave it you but now, to carry it To th'embroiderer's; with it, a bracelet To give the jeweller to set a-new. Men. Epi. You gave to me a bracelet, and the robe? Never—For when I'd giv'n the robe to you, I went directly to the market-place: Now first return I; nor have seen you since. Erot. I see through your design: because I trusted you, You would deceive me; that 'tis you would do. Men. Epi. I do not ask you for it to defraud you, But tell you, that my wife knows all the affair. Erot. Nor did I ask you for it: you yourself Gave it me freely; as a gift, you gave it; And now demand it back. Well, be it so: Let it be your's, take it; make use of it, You or your wife, preserve it as your eyes: But don't deceive yourself; after this day You never shall set foot within my doors, Since you have treated with contempt a woman, Who has not merited such usage from you. Next time you come, be sure bring money with you, You shall not have to visit me for nothing. Henceforth find some one else to disappoint. Men. Epi. You are too hasty—Hark you!—Stay—Come back Erot. Still are you there? and dare on my account Still to return? [Exit Erotium. Men. Epi. She's gone—has shut the door. Now I'm turn'd out indeed: nor can I gain Credit, or from my mistress or my wife. I'll go, consult my friends in the affair. [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES, with the robe. Men. Sos. 'Twas foolish in me when but now I trusted My purse with all that's in it, to Messenio. He has got, I doubt, into some brothel with it. Enter the WIFE of Menæchmus of Epidamnum. Wife. I'll now see if my husband is come home. But see, he's here! All's well, he brings my robe. Men. Sos. I wonder where Messenio can be got! Wife. I'll go, and talk to him as he deserves.— Art not asham'd, vile man, to appear before me, And with this robe? Men. Sos. Why, what's the matter, woman? What is't disturbs you! Wife. Dare you, impudence! Mutter a single word, or speak to me? Men. Sos. What have I done, I should not dare to speak? Wife. What! do you ask me? O, consummate impudence! Men. Sos. Did you ne'er hear, good woman, why the Grecians Call'd Hecuba a bitch? Wife. Not that I know of. Men. Sos. Because she did the same that you do now; Threw out abuse on every one she saw: And therefore, rightly did they call her bitch. Wife. I cannot bear these scandalous reproaches: I'd rather be a widow all my life, Than bear these vile reflections you throw on me. Men. Sos. What is't to me, whether you live as married, Or parted from your husband? Is it thus The custom to sing out such idle stories To strangers on their first arrival here? Wife. What idle stories? No, I will not bear it, I'd rather live a widow, than endure Your humours any longer. Men. Sos. 'Troth, for me Long as you please, you've leave to live a widow: As long as Jupiter shall keep his kingdom. Wife. You would not own but now, you stole that robe, And now you hold it out before my eyes? What! are you not asham'd? Men. Sos. By Hercules! You are an impudent and wicked woman, To dare to say this robe was stol'n from you; When it was given me by another woman, To get it alter'd for her. Wife. Yes, by Castor! I'll call my father hither, and lay open All your base actions to him. Decius, go, [to a Servant.] Seek for my father, bring him with you; say, 'Tis proper he should come.—I'll tell him all Your horrid usage.— Men. Sos. Are you in your senses? What horrid usage? Wife. How you have filch'd from me My robe, my gold, from me who are your wife, And giv'n them to your mistress—Say I not The very truth?— Men. Sos. I prithee, woman, say Where I may sup, to charm me from your tongue. I know not whom you take me for—For you, I know as much of Parthaon. Wife. Tho' you mock me, You can't, by Pollux! serve my father so, Who's just now coming hither—Look behind. Say, do you know him? Men. Sos. Just as I know Chalcas. The very day that I saw you, before This day did I see him— Wife. Dar'st thou deny That thou know'st me, deny thou know'st my father? Men. Sos. I'd say the same thing, did'st thou bring thy grandfather. Wife. By Castor! you are like yourself in all things. SCENE V. Enter OLD MAN. Old Man. Fast, as my age permits, and as the occasion Calls, will I push my steps, and hasten forward. How easily, I easily may guess. My speed forsakes me; I'm beset with age; I bear a weak, yet heavy laden body. Old age is a sad pedlar; on his back Carrying along a pack of grievances. It would be tedious to recount them all; But this affair I cannot well digest. What should this matter be, which makes my daughter Want me to come to her in such a hurry? She does not tell me what the business is, What 'tis she wants, nor why she sends for me; Yet I can give a shrewd guess, what it is: I'm apt to think, some quarrel with her husband. Such is their way, who of their portions proud, Would keep their husbands under government. Nor are the husbands often without fault. But there are bounds how far a wife should go. Nor does my daughter send to see her father, But when some fault's committed, or perhaps Some quarrel has arisen. What it is, I soon shall know.—For, look, I see her there, Before the door; and with her too, her husband, Whose looks are pensive—'Tis as I suspected— I'll call her.— Wife. I'll go meet him—Happiness Attend you, father! Old Man. That good will to you! Am I come here to see things go on well? Wherefore your order, that I should be sent for? Why are you pensive, say? and what's the reason Your husband keeps aloof in anger from you? The reason I know not, but there has been Some bickering between you—Who's in fault? Tell in few words—No long discourse about it.— Wife. I am in nought to blame, be easy then As to that point, my father. But I cannot Live longer with him, nor stay longer here. Therefore, I beg you take me hence away. Old Man. Say, what's the matter? Wife. Matter? I am made A laughing-stock. Old Man. By whom? Wife. By him you've made My husband. Old Man. So! a quarrel! say, how often I've warn'd you both, not to complain to me. Wife. How can I help it, Sir? Old Man. What! ask you me? Wife. Yes, if you'll give me leave. Old Man. How many times Have I advis'd you to conform to your husband? Never to watch his actions; where he goes, Or what he is about. Wife. But he's in love, Here in the neighbourhood, with a courtezan. Old Man. He's wise in that: and by that care of yours, In thus observing him, I would advise him To love still more. Wife. He drinks there, too. Old Man. For you, Think you he'll ever drink the less, or there, Or elsewhere, as he likes? What impudence! Do you insist, he never sup abroad, Nor entertain a stranger at your house? Would you, your husband should obey your pleasure? You may as well require him to partake Your work with you, and sit among the maids, And card the wool. Wife. I find, Sir, I have brought you No advocate for me, but for my husband. Here stand you as a patron in my cause, Yet plead for his.— Old Man. Was he in ought to blame, I should condemn him more than I do you. But when I see he keeps you richly cloth'd, Allows you servants, and a plenteous table, A wife thus treated, should in my opinion Bear towards him a more equal mind. Wife. But he Pilfers my gold, my robe from out my chest; Robs me, and carries to his courtezans My richest ornaments. Old Man. If he acts thus, He acts amiss: if not, you act but ill, When you accuse one that is innocent. Wife. Why, even at this very instant, Sir, He has a bracelet, and a robe of mine, Which he bore off here to this courtezan; And now he finds I know it, brings them back. Old Man. 'Tis right to know these matters from himself: I will accost, and speak to him. Say, Menæchmus, What's your dispute? Give me at once to know it. Why are you pensive? And why is your wife In wrath against you? Men. Sos. Whosoe'er you are, Whate'er's your name, I call great Jupiter, And all the gods to witness— Old Man. Why, and wherefore? Men. Sos. That I this woman ne'er have injur'd; her, Who raves about my stealing from her house This robe, and bearing of it off. If ever I've once set foot within her doors, I wish I may become the veriest wretch alive. Old Man. Have you your senses when you make that wish? Or, when deny that ever you set foot Within that house, where you reside yourself? O, of all madmen the most mad! Men. Sos. Old man, And do you say, that I inhabit here? Old Man. Do you deny it? Men. Sos. By Hercules, I do! Wife. 'Tis impudence to do so. But you mean, Because you went this night elsewhere. Old Man. Come hither, Daughter—And you, [to him] what say you now? This night went you from hence? Men. Sos. Whither? for what I pray you? Old Man. I know not. I. Wife. 'Tis plain he banters you. Old Man. [to her] What, can'st not hold thy tongue? Truly, Menæchmus, You've jested long enough: now to the purpose. Men. Sos. Pray, what have you to do with me? what business? Say whence you come; and who you are; and what I've done to you, or to this woman here, That ye thus teaze me?— Wife. How his eyes shine! See! A greenish colour spreads o'er all his temples, O'er all his forehead. See his eyes! they sparkle! Men. Sos. [aside.] Since they will have me mad, what can I do? Better then feign a madness, I may thus Fright them away.— Wife. Look how he yawns and stretches! What shall I do, my father! Old Man. Come this way, As far off from him as you can, my child. Men. Sos. Evoï, Evoï! Bacchus son of Jove, Why dost thou call me to the wood to hunt? I hear you, but I cannot stir from hence, This woman on the left side, watches me Like a mad dog; on t'other, this old goat, Who often in his life has by false witness Destroy'd the guiltless man.— Old Man. Woe on thy life! Men. Sos. See where Apollo from his oracle Commands me to burn out both that woman's eyes, With lighted torches. Wife. I'm undone, my father! He threatens me, to burn out both my eyes. Men. Sos. [aside.] Alas! they say I'm mad, yet they themselves Are much more mad than I. Old Man. Hark, you! my daughter! Wife. Your pleasure, Sir? What shall we do? Old Man. Suppose I call my servants quickly—I'll bring them, those Shall carry him into the house, there bind him, 'Ere he make more disturbance.— Men. Sos. On my word, [aside.] Unless I take great care, they'll bear me off By force into their house. Yes, thou hast order'd me, Not to forbear the thrusting of my fists Into her face, unless she marches off Far from my sight, and goes and hangs herself. Yes, yes, Apollo, I obey thy orders. Old Man. Run home, my daughter, run into the house Fast as you can, lest he belabour you. Wife. I fly. I pray you take good heed, my father, That he escape not. An unhappy wife Am I, to hear all this. [Exit. Men. Sos. I've sent her off, [aside.] Not ill. And now must I send after her This more than filthy fellow, this old grey beard, This totterer, this old Tithon, son of Cygnus— 'Tis thy command that I should break his limbs, [aloud.] His bones, his joints, with that same staff he carries. Old Man. Touch, or come nearer me, and you'll repent it. Men. Sos. Yes, I will do as you have order'd me, Take up this two-edg'd axe, bone this old fellow, And cut his bowels piece-meal. Old Man. 'Troth, I must Take care tho' of myself—I am afraid, He'll do a mischief to me, as he threatens. Men. Sos. Apollo! fast thou pour'st thy great behests— Now thou command'st me, harness my wild steeds, Fierce and untam'd; and now to mount my car And crush in pieces this Getulian lion, This stinking, toothless beast.—Now do I mount, And now I shake the reins—I take the lash; Now fly, my steeds, and let your sounding hoofs Tell your swift course—Shew in the turn your speed. Old Man. And dost thou threaten me with harness'd steeds? Men. Sos. Again, Apollo! thou again command'st me To rush upon yon fellow that stands there, And murder him. But who is this, that by My fluttering tresses plucks me from my car, The dire commands revoking of Apollo? Old Man. A sharp and obstinate distemper this! Ye gods! is't possible, a man who seem'd So well but now, should fall so suddenly Into so strange a malady? Away, I must make hast, and send for a physician. [Exit. Men. Sos. What! are they gone? Are they both fled my sight? Who forc'd me in my wits to feign the madman. What hinders now, to 'mbark me, while I'm well? I beg you, Sirs, [to the spectators.] if the old man return, Not to discover, down what street I took.— [Exit. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter OLD MAN. OLD MAN. My limbs with sitting ach, my eyes with watering, While this same Doctor from his patients comes. Scarcely arriv'd at home, he's telling me, He was oblig'd to set a broken leg Of Æsculapius, and Apollo's arm. I'm thinking whether I am bringing with me, Or a physician, or a carpenter— But see! he comes, tho' with an emmet's pace. SCENE II. Enter PHYSICIAN. Phys. What did you say was his disorder, Sir? Inform me, is he mad, or is he frantick? Is it a lethargy, or is he dropsical? Old Man. I brought you hither to know that of you, And that your art should cure him. Phy. Nought more easy. From this time, I engage he shall be well. Old Man. I'd have great care ta'en of him in his cure. Phys. My frequent visits oft will make me puff, Such great care I shall take in curing him. Old Man. But see the man! Phy. Let us observe his actions. SCENE III. Enter MENÆCHMUS of Epidamnum. Men. Epi. This day has been unlucky, and to me Quite adverse—what I thought to have done in secret, Has been discover'd by this Parasite, And brought both fear and infamy upon me. He my Ulysses was, and my adviser; Yet nought but evil heaps on me his king. His thread of life, if I but live myself, Will I cut off. How like a fool I talk! His thread of life! His thread of life is mine; He eats my victuals, lives at my expence. Yes, I will be the death of him. Besides, This wench has acted but in character, The manner of them all. When I request her To give me back the robe to give my wife, She tells me, she already had return'd it. 'Troth, I'm unhappy! Old Man. Hear you what he says? Phys. He says he is unhappy. Old Man. Pray go nearer. Phys. Save you, Menæchmus. Why do you bare your arms? You know not how it helps on your disorder. Men. Epi. Go hang yourself. [to the Phys.] Phys. What think you now? Men. Epi. What think? What can I think? Phys. To work a cure requires More than an acre of good hellebore. Hark ye! Menæchmus? Men. Epi. What would'st thou with me? Phys. Answer to what I ask: Say, do you drink White wine or red? Men. Epi. Go, hang yourself. Phys. I find The mad fit just now coming on. Men. Epi. Why not Ask me as well the colour of my bread, Whether I eat it purple, red, or yellow? Whether eat scaly birds, or feather'd fish. Old Man. Hark! how deliriously he talks! or e'er He grows stark staring mad, give him some potion. Phys. Hold, stay a little, I shall farther question him. Old Man. More idle talk will quite demolish him. Phys. Tell me but this; do you ever find your eyes Grow hard? Men. Epi. Do you take me for a locust, fool? Phys. Do you find your bowels make a noise sometimes? Men. Epi. When I am full, my bowels make no noise: They do, when I am hungry.— Phys. By my troth, In this he does not answer like a madman. D'you sleep till day-light? When you go to bed, D'you get to sleep with ease? Men. Epi. My debts discharg'd, I sleep with ease. May Jove and all the gods Confound this questioner! Phys. He 'gins to rave. [aside. Take heed of what you say. Old Man. In what he says, He's much more moderate than he was but now. 'Tis but a while ago, he said, his wife Was a mad bitch. Men. Epi. What did I say? Old Man. You're mad, I say. Men. Epi. What I? Old Man. You there, who threaten'd me, You'd trample me beneath your horse's feet. I saw you do it, and I will maintain it. Men. Epi. And I well know, you've stol'n Jove's sacred crown, And for the fact have been confin'd in prison. And when releas'd, you've been severely whip'd Under a gibbet. And I know besides, You've kill'd your father, and have sold your mother. Think you I am so mad, I can't devise The same abusive language against you, As you can do 'gainst me. Old Man. Doctor, I beg you, What you intend to do to him, do quickly. Do you not see he's mad? Phys. 'Twere the best thing, You know, to have him carried to my house. Old Man. Do you think so? Phys. Why not? I there can treat him As I think proper. Old Man. Do just as you please. Phys. About some twenty days, you shall drink hellebore. Men. Epi. And you, some thirty days, shall be tied up, And flog'd severely. Phys. Go, and call your men, To bring him to my house. Old Man. How many men D'ye think will be sufficient? Phys. As I see him So mad, not less than four. Old Man. They shall be here Immediately. Take care of him, good doctor. Phys. I'll home to get things ready that are wanting. Go, bid your servants bring him to my house. Old Man. I will take care that he shall soon be there. Phys. I'm gone. Old Man. Farewell. [Exeunt Phys. and Old Man separately. Men. Epi. The father-in-law is gone, And so's the doctor. Now I am alone. How is it, Jove, these men will have me mad! Since I was born, I've ne'er been sick one day. Nor am I mad, nor do I seek for quarrels, Nor stir up strifes. I'm well in health, and see Others the same: I know men, and I speak to them. Is't not, that those who say that I am mad, Are mad themselves? What shall I do? I would Go home; but then my wife will not permit it.— My mistress too will not admit me. This All of it's ill. I'll e'en stay here till night, And I may get admittance in the dark. [stands apart. SCENE IV. Enter MESSENIO. Mess. 'Tis on all hands allow'd to be the proof Of a good servant, when he takes good care of, Looks after, thinks of, and disposes rightly His master's business. That, when he is absent, Things may go on as well, or even better Than when he's present. He whose heart is right, Will think his back of greater consequence Than is his gullet: Ay, and to his belly Prefer his legs. He ought to bear in mind The wages, servants good for nothing, idle, Or wicked, from their masters hands receive; And these are, stripes and chains, the stocks, the mill, Hard labour, cold and hunger. Such as these Are the rewards of idleness. This evil I'm terribly afraid of; therefore choose Rather to do my duty, than neglect it. Words I can bear, but stripes I hate. I rather Like to eat that which has been ground by others, Than grind myself what others are to eat. I therefore execute my master's orders Well; and with sober diligence I serve him: This turns to my account—Let others act then As best they think it for their interest, I'll ever be that which I ought to be: This fear I'll still retain, to keep me free From fault; that wheresoe'er my master is, I may be ready there to wait on him. Those servants who have nothing done amiss, Yet keep this fear, still make themselves of use To their respective masters. But the servants Who never live in fear of doing wrong, Fear, when they've something done to merit punishment. As for myself, I shan't live long in fear— The time draws nigh, when master will reward me For all the pains I have been at to serve him. I've serv'd him so, as to consult my back. Now that I've plac'd the servants, as he order'd, And what they'd want i'th'inn, I'm come to meet him. I'll now knock at the door, that he may know I'm here, tho' doubtful whether I can bring him Safe off from this vile house—I fear me much Lest I should come after the battle's fought. SCENE V. Enter OLD MAN, with Servants. Old Man. [to the Servants.] By gods and men, I here conjure you all To take good care to execute the orders Given you already; and I now repeat them. See that man carried to the doctor's house; On pain of both your sides and legs, obey me. Be sure, each of you, not to heed his threats there. Why stand you thus? why hesitate? e'en now He ought to've been borne off. I'll go myself Strait to the doctor: when you are got thither, You'll find me there before you— [Exit Old Man. Men. Epi. I'm undone. What is the matter? What do these men want, That they run here so fast? What is't you want? Why do you thus surround me? Why thus hale me? Where would you carry me? Undone! help! help! Aid me, ye Epidamnians! Let me go. [to the Servants. Mess. Ye gods, what do I see! What men are these Who thus unworthily are bearing off My master? Men. Epi. What, will no one dare to help me? Mess. Master, I will, and boldly too.—What villainy! Ye Epidamnians, thus to seize my master, In the open street, by day light, undisturb'd By tumults in your city—A free man He enter'd it—Then let him go, I say— Men. Epi. Whoe'er you are, assist me, I beseech you, Nor let them do such signal outrage on me. Mess. Yes, I'll assist, defend, and succour you. 'Tis far more just, that I myself should perish, Than suffer you to be thus treated, master: Pluck out that fellow's eye, I beg of you, Who holds you by the shoulder. I'll myself Plant in these rascals chaps a crop of blows. If you persist in bearing him away, You'll find you'll have the worst of it. Let him go. Men. Epi. I've got hold of the rascal's eye. Mess. Why then, Let in his head the socket strait appear. Rogues! Rascals! Servants. You'll murder us. Have mercy! Mess. Let him go then. Men. Epi. What is't ye mean, you rascals! By laying hands on me thus violently? Curry the scoundrels with your blows. Mess. Away, Begone, go and be hang'd, ye rascals! You there, that are the last to quit your hold, Take this along with you as a reward— [strikes him. So, so: I think I've on this scoundrel's chaps Written in red letters.—'Troth, I came in time To your assistance, master. Men. Epi. May the gods! Whoe'er you are, be ever kind to you, Young man. For without you, I ne'er had seen The setting sun this day. Mess. By Pollux! therefore, If you do right, you'll give me, Sir, my freedom. Men. Epi. Give you your freedom! Mess. Out of doubt, my master, Since I have sav'd your life. Men. Epi. How's this! young man, You are mistaken. Mess. I mistaken! how? Men. Epi. I swear by father Jupiter, I'm not Your master. Mess. Can you say so? Men. Epi. I don't lie. I never had a servant yet; I say, Who ever did for me, what you have done? Mess. If then you will not own me for your servant, E'en let me go, and have my liberty. Men. Epi. As far as in my power, take your liberty, And go where'er you please. Mess. Then you command me? Men. Epi. Yes sure, as far as I've a right to do so. Mess. My patron, thanks! A Servant. I joy to see you free, Messenio. Mess. In troth I well believe you. By Hercules! I do. And, now, my patron, I beg, you'd lay on me the same commands As when I was your servant. I'll live with you: And, when you home return, go with you, Sir. Men. Epi. No, by no means. Mess. I'll go now to the inn, And bring your goods and money to you strait: The purse which has your money, is fast seal'd Within the cloak-bag. I'll go bring it strait. Men. Epi. Do so, and quickly. Mess. Sir, I'll bring them back In the same state as when you gave them me. Wait for me here. [Exit Mess. Men. Epi. What I've to-day experienc'd In many instances is most extraordinary. Some of them say, that I am not the man I am, and shut me out of doors. And here A man insists upon't, he is my servant— And I just now have given him his freedom. He talks of bringing money to me strait; Which if he does, I'll tell him he has liberty To go from me whene'er it suits him best. My father-in-law and the physician say That I am mad. 'Tis strange what this should be: It seems to me no other than a dream. I'll now go to this courtezan, and see, Tho' she is angry with me, if I can't Prevail on her, to let me have the robe To carry home, and give it to my wife. [Exit Men. Epi. SCENE VI. Enter MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES and MESSENIO. Men. Sos. And do you dare affirm, audacious fellow, That you have met me any where to-day, When I had order'd you to meet me here? Mess. It is so true, that I not only met you; But that e'en now, I freed you from four men, Before this very house, who seiz'd on you, And would have borne you off. You call'd on gods And men for their assistance. I ran up, And snatch'd you from them, notwithstanding all Their efforts to the contrary, and fought them. On which account, as I had done you service, You gave my freedom to me: After that, You bade me go, and fetch your goods and money. You've hasten'd on, fast as you could, before, To frustrate your own deeds— Men. Sos. And did I bid you Depart a freeman? Mess. Certainly. Men. Epi. And 'tis Most certain, I'm as much a slave myself As e'er I gave to you your liberty. SCENE VII. Enter MENÆCHMUS of Epidamnum, from EROTIUM's house. Men. Epi. Vile woman as you are! tho' you should swear By all that's dear to you, that I this day Bore off that robe and bracelet, yet you never, No, never should convince me. Mess. Gods immortal! What is it that I see? Men. Sos. Why, what do you see? Mess. Why, your resemblance, Sir, as in a mirror. Men. Sos. What is't you mean? Mess. Your image, and as like As possible. Men. Sos. 'Troth, if I know myself, 'Tis not unlike. Men. Epi. Young man, whoe'er you are, The gods preserve you! you have sav'd my life. Mess. Young man, if 'tis not disagreeable, Tell me your name? Men. Epi. You have so much oblig'd me, You cannot ask what I'd be slow to grant you. My name's Menæchmus. Men. Sos. Mine's Menæchmus too. Men. Epi. I'm a Sicilian, and of Syracuse. Men. Sos. I am the same: it is my native country— Men. Epi. What's that I hear? Men. Sos. You hear the very truth. Mess. I know this gentleman; he is my master. I am his servant. But I thought myself The other's servant. Sir, [to Men. Sos.] I thought him, you; And by so doing, gave you some uneasiness. If I have said ought foolish or imprudent, I pray you pardon me. Men. Sos. You're mad, I think. Don't you remember, that this very day You disembark'd with me? Mess. Nothing more just. You are my master. Seek [to Men. Epi.] another servant. [To Men. Sos.] God save you, Sir! and you, [to Men. Epi.] good Sir, adieu! This is, I say, Menæchmus. Men. Epi. I say, I am. Men. Sos. What comedy is this? What! you Menæchmus! Men. Epi. I am, Sir!—and my father's name was Moschus. Men. Sos. And are you then my father's son? Men. Epi. I'm son Of my own father, youth. I do not want To claim your father, nor to take him from you. Mess. Ye gods! confirm the unexpected hope Which I'm conceiving. These, if I mistake not, Are the twin brothers; for they both agree, In owning the same father, the same country. I'll call aside my master. Sir! Menæchmus! Both Men. Whom is't you want? Mess. I want but one of you. But which of you came with me in the ship? Men. Epi. Not I. Men. Sos. 'Twas I. Mess. Why then, 'tis you I want. Come this way. Men. Sos. Well, I'm here, what do you want? Mess. That man is an impostor, Sir, or else He's your twin brother. For I never saw Two men, one like the other so exactly. Water is, I assure you, not more like To water, nor is milk more like to milk, Than he is like to you, and you to him. Besides, he owns himself of the same country, And claims too the same father. Best accost him, And ask him some few questions. Men. Sos. Your advice Is right, by Hercules!—I thank you for it. Beseech you, give me farther your assistance; And, if you find us brothers, you shall have Your freedom. Mess. Sir, I hope I shall. Men. Sos. I hope The same. Mess. [to Men. Epi.] What was't you said? I think it was That you are call'd Menæchmus? Men. Epi. Yes. Mess. But he Is call'd Menæchmus too.—In Sicily You said that you was born, a citizen Of Syracuse—Why there was he born too. You've likewise said that Moschus was your father? Why, Moschus was his father too. And now It's in the power of both of you to assist me; And, in assisting me, to assist yourselves. Men. Epi. You have deserv'd so much of me, that what You ask, you may command. Free as I am I'll serve you, just as if I was your slave. Mess. I hope you're just upon the point of finding That you're twin brothers, born at the same time, Sons of one father, and one mother too. Men. Epi. You mention wonders. Would you could effect That which you've given assurance of— Mes. I can. Come now. To that which I shall ask of you, Both answer me. Men. Epi. Ask when you please, I'll answer, And not conceal one jot of what I know. Mess. Is then your name Menæchmus? Men. Epi. Yes, I own it. Mess. And yours the same? Men. Sos. It is. Mess. You also say Your father's name was Moschus. Men. Epi. Yes, I do. Men. Sos. And mine the same. Mess. Are you of Syracuse? Men. Epi. Most certainly. Mess. And you? Men. Soss. No doubt of it. Mess. Hitherto all the marks agree right well. But let's go on. What's the most distant thing, You recollect to have happened in your country? Men. Epi. The going with my father to Tarentum I'th'way of merchandising: in the crowd My straying from my father; after that, My being hither brought. Men. Sos. Preserve me, Jupiter! Mess. Why is that exclamation? Hold your peace. [To Men. Epi.] Say, when your father from your country took you, What was your age? Men. Epi. Seven years: for I remember Just at that time my teeth began to shed— Nor from that time have I e'er seen my father. Mess. How many children had your father? Men. Epi. Two, If I remember right. Mess. Was you or he The elder? Men. Epi. We were both of the same age. Mess. How can that be?— Men. Epi. We both were twins— Men. Sos. The gods Are pleas'd to bless me— Mess. If you interrupt me, I'll say no more. Men. Sos. Rather than so, I'm silent. Mess. Say, had you both one name? Men. Epi. Not so—My name Was, as 'tis now, Menæchmus. But my brother They named Sosicles. Men. Sos. I own the proofs. I cannot hold out longer. I'll embrace him.— My brother, my twin brother, hail! 'Tis I Am Sosicles. Men. Epi. If so, why was you afterwards Menæchmus call'd? Men. Sos. When afterwards we heard You and your father both were dead, my grandfather Changing my name, gave me the same as yours. Men. Epi. Well, I believe 'tis all just as you say. But in your turn now answer me. Men. Sos. Your pleasure. Men. Epi. What was our mother's name? Men. Sos. 'Twas Theusimarche. Men. Epi. All this agrees. Hail, my unlook'd-for brother! Whom after years of absence, I now see. Men. Sos. The same all Hail! to you, my dearest brother! For whom I've search'd till now with so much pains, And whom I now rejoice to have found at last. Mess. It was on this account, the courtezan Then call'd you by his name, and taking you For him, she ask'd you to her house to dinner. Men. Epi. 'Troth, I this day had order'd at her house A dinner, to my wife unknown, from whom I filch'd a robe, and gave her as a present. Men. Sos. Is this the robe you see me have, my brother? Men. Epi. How came it in your hands? Men. Sos. A common woman Invited me to dine, and said 'twas I That gave it her—I eat a hearty dinner, Drank freely, entertain'd myself with her, And got this robe, this bracelet— Men. Epi. I'm glad, brother, That you have far'd so well on my account: For when she ask'd you home to dinner with her, 'Twas me she took you for. Mess. What hinders then, But, as you promis'd me, I should be free? Men. Epi. He asks but what is right and just, my brother, Do it on my account. Men. Sos. Be free. Men. Epi. I joy, Messenio, that you have obtain'd your freedom. Mess. You see a better hand than yours was wanting To make me free for life. Men. Sos. Since things are thus As we could wish, let's both return together To our native country. Men. Epi. As you please, my brother. I'll make an auction, and sell all I have. In the mean time, my brother, let's go in. Men. Sos. With all my heart. Mess. Can you guess what I'd ask? Men. Epi. What is it? Mess. That you'd make me auctioneer. Men. Epi. 'Tis granted— Mess. Well, Sir, shall I then proclaim The auction strait? and for what day? Men. Epi. The seventh. Mess. O yes!—O yes!—This, Sirs, is to give notice.— The auction of Menæchmus will begin The seventh of this month: when will be sold Slaves, houseshold goods, farms, houses, and—et cetera. All may attend that will; and we sell all For ready money. Sell his wife besides, If any purchaser should offer. I scarce think Our auction will amount to fifty times A thousand sesterces. [To the spectators.] Spectators, now Adieu! and favour us with a loud applause. [Exeunt. The End of the Twin Brothers.</field>
