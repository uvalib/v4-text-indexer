      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus Scena Prima. Enter Richardo and Viola. Rich. Let us make use of this stolne privacy, And not loose time in protestation, mistris, For twere in me a kind of breach of faith, To say againe I love you. Uio. Sweet speake softly For though the venture of your love to me, Meetes with a willing, and a full returne: Should it arrive unto my Fathers knowledge; These were our last discourse. Rich. How shall he know it? Uiol. His watching cares are such, for my advancement, That every where his eye is fix'd upon me: This night that does afford us some small freedom, At the request and much entreaty of, The mistris of the house, was hardly given me: For I am never sufferd to stir out, But he hath spies upon me, yet I know not You have so won upon me, that could I thinke You would love faithfully (though to entertaine Another thought of you, would be my death) I should adventure on his utmost anger. Rich. Why, do you thinke I can be false? Uio. No faith, You have an honest face, but if you shouldâ Rich. Let all the stored vengeance of heavens justiceâ Uio. No more, I do believe you, the dance ended, Which this free womans ghests have vow'd to have Ere they depart, I will make home, and store me With all the Iewells, Chaines, and gold are trusted Unto my custody, and at the next corner, To my Fathers house, before one at the farthest, Be ready to receive me. Rich. I desire No bond beyond your promise, let's go in, To talke thus much before the doore, may breed, Suspition. Enter Mercury and Antonio talking. Uiol. Here are company too. Rich. Away, Those powers that prosper true and honest loves Will blesse our undertakeings. Uio. 'Tis my wish Sir. Exit Rich and Uiol. Mer. Nay, Sir, excuse me, I have drawne you to, Too much expence already in my travell: And you have been to forward in your love; To make my wants your owne, allow me manners Which you must grant I want, should I encrease, The bond in which your courtisyes have tide me: Be still consuming you, give me leave To take mine owne wayes now; and I shall often With willingnesse come to visit you, and then thanke you. Ant. By this hand I could be angry, what do you thinke me? Must we that have so long time, beene as one Seene Cityes, Countryes, Kingdomes, and their wonders Beene bedfellowes, and in our various journey Mixt all our observations, part (as if We were 2. Carriers at 2. severall wayes, And as the forehorse guides, cry God be with you) Without or complement, or cerimony? In travelers that know transalpine garbes, Though our designes are neere so serious, friend, It were a capitall crime; it must not be, Nay what is more, you shall not, you ere long Shall see my house, and finde what I call mine Is wholly at your service. Mer, 'Tis this tires me, Sir I were easily woo'd if nothing else But my will lay in the choyce, but 'tis not so My friends and kindred that have part of me, And such on whom my chiefest hopes depend, Iustly expect the tender of my love After my travell, then mine owne honesty Tells me 'tis poore, having indifferent meanes To keep me in my quallity and rank, At my returne to tire anothers bounty, And let mine owne grow lusty, pardon me. Ant. I will not, cannot, to conclude I dare not: Can any thing confer'd upon my friend Be burthensome to me? for this excuse Had I no reason else you should not leave me, By a travellers faith you should not, I have said, And then you know my humour, ther's no contending. Mer. Is there no way to scape this Inundation? I shall be drown'd with folly if I go: And after 9. dayes men may take me up, With my gall broken. Ant. Are you yet resolv'd? Mer. Wood you would spare me. Ant. By this light I cannot By all, that may be sworne by. Mer. Patience helpe me, And heaven grant his folly be not catching: If it be, the townes undone, I now would give A reasonable sum of gold to any sheriff, That would but lay an execution on me, And free me from his company; while he was abroad, His want of witt and language kept him dumbe: But Balaam's Asse will speake now without spurring. Ant. Speake, have I won you?â Enter Servant and Musitian. Mer. You are not to be resisted. Ser. Be ready I entreat you the dance done, Besides a liberall reward I have, A bottle of sherry in my power shall beget New crotchets in your heads. Musit. Tush feare not us, wee'le do our parts. Ser. Go in, Ant. I know this fellow. Belong you to the house? Ser. I serve the Mistris. Ant. Pretty, and short, pray you sir then informe her, Two Gentlemen are covetous to be honour'd, With her faire presence. Ser. She shall know so much, This is a merry night with us, and forbid not Welcom to any that lookes like a man: I'le guide you the way. Ant. Nay follow, I have a trick in't. Exit. Enter Uberto, Siluio, Richardo, Maria, Pedro. Portia, Uiola, with others. Uber. Come wher's this masque? fairest for our cheare, Our thankes and service, may you long surviue, To joy in many of these nights. Mar. I thanke you. Uber. We must have musique too, or ells you give us, But halfe a welcom Mar. Pray you Sir excuse me. Silu. By no meanes Lady. Uber. Weele crowne your liberall feast, With some delightfull straine fitting your love: And this good company. Mar. Since you enforce it, I will not plead the excuse of want of skill Or be, or nice, or curious, every year, I celebrate my marriage night; and will 'Till I see my absent husband. Uber. 'Tis fit freedome. Silu. Richardo thou art dullâ Enter Servant. Rich. I shall be lighter, When I have had a heate. Mar. Now Sir, the newes? Ser. Mistris there are 2. Gentlemen. Mar. Where? Ser. Complementing who should first enter. Mar. What are they? Ser. Heaven knowes, but for their strangenesse, have you never seen a Cat wash her face? Uber. Yes. Ser. Iust such a stir they keep if you make but hast, You may see 'em yet before they enter. Enter Antonio and Mercurie. Mer. Let 'em be what they will, wee'le give them faire Entertaine, and gentle welcome. Ant. It shall be so. Mer. Then let it be your pleasure. Ant. Let's stand a side and you shall see us have Fine sport anon. Mer. A faire society, do you know these Gentle women? Ant. Yes. Mer. What are they? Ant. The second is a neighbours daughter, her name is Uiola. There is my kinsmans wife, Portia her name, and a Friend too. Mer. Let herâwhat's she that leades the dance? 1. Ser. A Gentlewoman. Mer. I see that. 1. Ser. Indeed? Mer. What? 1. Ser. A Gentlewoman. Mer. Udsfoote, good Sir what's she that leades the dance? 2. Ser. My Mistris. Mer. VVhat els? 2. Ser. My Mistris, Sir. Mer. Your Mistris? a pox on you, What a fry of fooles are here? I see 'tis treason to underst?d in this house; if nature were not better to them, then they can be to themselves, they would scant hitt their mouthes; my Mistris? Is there any one with so much witt in's head, that can tell me at the first sight, what Gentlewoman that is that leades the dance? Ant. 'Tis my wife. Mer. Hum. Ant. How do'st thou like her? Mer. VVell, a pretty Gentlewoman. Ant. Prethee be quiet. Mer. I would I could Let never any hereafter that's a man, That has affections in him and free passions, Receive the least tye from such a foole as this is, That holds so sweet a wife, 'tis lamentable to consider truly What right he robbs himselfe of, and what wrong He doth the youth of such a Gentlewoman? That knowes her beauty is no longer hers, Then men will please to make it so, and use it Neither of which lyes freely in a husband, O what have I don, what have I don, Coxcomb? If I had never seen, or never tasted The goodnesse of this kix, I had beene a made man, But now to make a Cuckold is a sinne Against all forgivenesse, worse then a murther; I have a Woolfe by the eares, and am bitten both wayes. Ant. How now friend, what are you thinking of? Mer. Nothing concerning you, I must be gone. Ant. Pardon me, Ile have no going sir. Mer. Then good sir give me leave to goe to bed, I am very weary and ill tempered. Ant. You shall presently, the dance is done. 1 Ser. Mistris, these are the gentlemen. Mar. My husband will come home, deare sir. Mer. She's faire still, O that I were a knave or durst be one, For thy sake coxcobe; he that invented honesty, undid me. Ant. I had you had not knowne me, y'are merry tis well thought, And how ist with these worthy Gent? Vb. &amp;c Sil. We are glad to see you here againe Ant. Oh Gent, what ha' you lost? but get you into travells, There you may learne, I cannot say what hidden vertues. Mer. Hidden from you I am sure, My blood boyles like a furnace, Shees a faire one. Ant. Pray entertaine this Gent. with all the curtesie, Fitting my most especiall friend. Mar. What this poore house may yeild, To make you welcome deare sir command Without more complement. Mer. I thanke you: Shee's wise and speakes well too, oh what a blessing Is gone by me neere to be recovered? Well, twas an old shame the Devill laid up for mee, and now has hit me home; if there be any waies to bee dishonest and save my selfe yet,âNo it must not bee, why should I bee a foole toâYet those eyes would tempt another Adam, how they call to me, and tell meâ Sfoote they shall not tell me any thing, sir will you walke in. Ant. How ist Signior? Mer. Crazie a litle. Mar. What ayle you sir? Whats in my power pray make use of, sir. Mer. Tis that must doe me good, she do's not mock An't please you nothing, my disease is only wearinesse. Vb. Come Gent. weele not keepe you from your bedds too long. Rich. I ha some businesse, and tis late, and you far from your lodging. Sil. Well. Exit. Manent, Ant. Mar. and Mer. Ant. Come my deare Mercury, ile bring you to your chamber, and then I am for you, Maria, thou art a new wife to me now, and thou shalt finde it, ere I sleepe. Mer. And I, an old asse to my selfe, mine owne rod whips me,âgood sir no more of this, tis tedious, you are the best guide in your owne houseâgoe sirâ Exit Ant. &amp;c Mer. This foole, and his faire wife have made me franticke From two such physickes for the soule, deliver me. Enter Richardo, Vberto, Pedro, &amp;c Silvio. Vb. VVell, you must have this wench then. Ric. I hope so, I am much o'th bow hand else. Ped. VVood I were hangd, tis a good loving little foole that dares venture her selfe upon a coast she never knew yet, but these women, when they are once thirteene, god speede the plough. Sil. Faith they'le venture further, so their lading then a Merchant, and through as many stormes, but theyle bee fraughted, they are made like Carrecks only strength and storage. Ric. Come, come, you talke, you talke. Sil. VVe doe so, but tell me Richardo, woote thou marry her? Ric. Marry her? why what should I do with her? Ped. Pox, I thought we should have had all shares in her like lawfull prize. Ric. No by my faith sir, you shall pardon me, I lancht her at my owne charge without partners, and so ile keepe her. Vb. VVhats the houre? Rich. Twelve. Vb. VVhat shall we doe the while? tis yet scarce eleven. Sil. Theres no standing here, is not this the place? Ric. Yes. Ped. And to go back unto her fathers house, may breede suspition lets slip into a Taverne, for an houre, tis very cold. Vb. Content, there is one hard by, a quart of burnt sack will recover us, I am as cold as Christmas, this stealing flesh in the frosty weather, may be sure 'ith eating, but sure the woodmen have no great catch on't; shalls go? Rich. Thou art the strangest lover of a taverne, what shall we doe there now? loose the hower and our selves too? Vb. Loose a pudding; what do'st thou talke of the bowre; will one quart muzle us? have wee not eares to beare, and tongues to aske the drawers, but wee must stand here like bawds to watch the minuts? Sil. Prethee content thy selfe, we shall scout here, as though we went a haying, and have some mangey prentice, that cannot sleepe for scratching, over eare us, come will you goe sirs? when your love fury is a little frozen, youle come to us.

The night is terrible and I enclos'd With that my vertue and my self hate most; Darkenesse; yet must I feare that which I wish, Some company, and every step I take Sounds louder in my fearefull eares to night Then ever did, the shrill and sacred bell That rang me to my prayers; the house will rise When I unlock the doore, were it by day I am bold enough, but then a thousand eyes Warne me from going, might not God have made A time for envious prying folke to sleepe Whilst lovers met, and yet the sunne have shone? Yet I was bold enough, to steale this key Out of my fathers Chamber, and dare yet Venture upon mine enemy, this night, Arm'd onely with my love, to meet my friend. Alas how valiant, and how fraid at once Love makes a Virgin? I will throw this key Back through a windowe, I had wealth enough In Iewels with me, if I hold his love I steale e'm for; farewell my place of birth, I never make account to looke on thee againe; And if there be as I have heard men say, These houshold gods, I doe beseech them looke To this my charge, blesse it from theeves and fire, And keepe till happily my love I win Me from thy doore, and hold my Father in.

Enter a Servingman aboue unready. Ser. Who calls there? Mer. Pray take the paines to rise and light a candle. Ser. Presently, Mer. Was ever man but I in such a stockes? well this shal be a warning to me, and a faire one too, how I betray my selfe to such a dunce, by way of benefit. Enter Servingman. Ser. Did you call? Mer. Yes, pray doe me the kindnesse sir, to let me out and not to enquire why, for I must needs be gone. Ser. Not to night, I hope sir. Mer. Good sir to night, I would not have troubled you else, pray let it be so. Ser. Alas sir, my Master will be offended. Mer. That I have businesse? no I warrant yee. Ser. Good sir take your rest. Mer. Pray my good friend let me appoint my owne rest. Ser. Yes sir. Mer. Then shew me the way out, I'le consider you. Ser. Good Lord, sir. Mer. If I had not an excellent tempered patience, now should I breake this fellowes head, and make him understand 'twere necessary; the onely plague of this house is the unhandsome love of servants, that neere doe their duty in the right place, but when they muster before dinner, and sweep the table with a wodden dagger, and then they are troublesom too, to all mens shoulders, the Woodcocks flesht agen, now I shall have a new stir. Enter Antonio. Ant. VVhy how now friend? what do you up so late? are you well? do you want any thing? pray speake. Mer. Onely the cause I rise for. Ant.

Shee's here already; sweet hart: how say you by this Gentleman? he would away at midnight. Wife. That I am sure hee will not. Mer. Indeed I must. Mari. Good Sir let not your homely entertainement presse you to leave your bed at midnight; if you want, what my house or your towne may afford you, make it your own fault if you call not for it pray go to bed again; let me compell you, I am sure you have no power to denye a woman; the ayre is piercing, &amp; to a body beaten with long travell, 'twill prove an ill Physitian. Mer. If she speake longer I shall be a knaue, as ranke as ever sweat for't; Sir if you will send your wife up presently, I will either stay with you, d'ye marke, me or deliver you, so just a cause, that you your selfe, shall thrust me out of doores, both suddainly and willingly.

Let her in and me out together, 'tis but one labour, tis pity shee should stand ith' street, it seemes she knowes you. Ant. There shee shall stand for me, you are ignorant; this is a common custome of the Rogues that lie about the loose parts of the City. Mer. As how? Ant. To knock at doores in dead time of night, and use some fained voyce to raise compassion, and when the doores are open, in they rush, and cut the throats of all and take the booty, we cannot be too carefull. Within Ui. As ever you had pity let me in, I am undone else. Ant. Who are you? Vio. My name is Viola, a Gentlewoman, that ill chance hath distressed, you know my father. Mer. Alas of god we'll let her in, 'tis one of the Gentlewomen were here ith' evening, I know her by her name, (poore soule) shee's cold I warrant her, let her have my warme Bed, and Ile take her fortune; come, pray come. Ant. It is not Viola that's certaine, she went home to her fathers, I am sure; Vio. Will not you be so good to let me in? Ant. I'le be so good to have you whipt away if you stay a little longer: Shee's gone I warrant her, now let mee know your cause for I will heare it, and not repent the knowing. Mer. Since you are so importunate, I'le tell you, I love your wife extreamly. Ant. Uery well. Mer. And so well that I dare not stay. Ant. VVhy? Mer. For wronging you, I know I am flesh and blood, and you have done me friendships infinite and often, that must require me honest and a true man, and I will be so or I'le breake my heart. Ant. VVhy, you may stay for all this, methinks. Mer. No, though I wood be good, I am no saint, nor is it safe to try mee, I deale plainely. Ant. Come, I dare try you, do the best you can. Mer. You shall not when I am right agen, I'le come and see you, till when, I'le use all Countryes and all meanes, but I will loose this folly, 'tis a Divell. Ant. Is there no way to stay you? Mer. No, unles you will have me such a villaine to you as all men shall spit at mee. Ant. Do's she know you love her? Mer. No I hope not, that were recompence fit for a Rogue to render her. Ant. If ever any had a faithfull friend I am that man, and I may glory in't, this is he, that ipse, he that passes all Christendome for goodnesse, hee shall not over go me in his friendship twere recreant and base, and I'le be hang'd first, I am resolv'd, go thy wayes, a wife shall never part us, I have consider'd and I finde her nothing to such a friend as thou art; I'le speake a bold word, take your time and woe her, you have overcome me cleerely, and do what's fitting with her, you conceive mee, I am glad at hart you love her: by this light, ne're stare upon me for I will not flye from it, if you had spoken sooner, sure you had bin serv'd; Sir, you are not every man, now to your taske, I give you free leave, and the sinne is mine if there be any in it. Mer. Hee will be hang'd before he makes this good, hee cannot be so innocent a Coxcombe, he can tell ten sure, if I had never knowne you as I have done, I might be one, as others perhaps sooner, but now 'tis impossible ther's too much good betweene us. Ant. Well thou art een the best manâI can say no more, I am, so over joy'd, you must stay this night, and in the morning go as earely as you please, I have a toy for you. Mer. I thought this pill would make you sicke. Ant. But where you meane to be I must have notice, And it must be hard by too, do you marke me? Mer. Why? what's the matter? Ant. There is a thing in hand. Mer. Why? what thing? Ant. A sound one, if it take right, and you be not peevish We two will beâyou would little thinke it; as famous for our friendshipâ Mer. How? Ant. If God please, as ever Damon was and Pytheas or Pylades, and Orestes, or any two that ever were: do you conceive me yet? Mer. No by my troth Sir; he will not help me up sure. Ant. You shall anon, and for our names, I thinke they shal live after us, and be remember'd while there is a story; or I loose my aime. Mer. What a vengeance ailes hee? how do you? Ant. Yes faith, wee two wilbe such friends as the world shall ring off. Mer. And why is all this? Ant. You shall enjoy my wife. Mer. Away, away. Ant. The wonder must begin, so I have cast it, 'twill be scurvy else, you shall not stirr a foote i'nt, pray be quiet 'till I have made it perfect. Mer. What shall a man do with this wretched fellow? there is no mercy to be used towards him, he is not capable of any pitty, he will in spight of course be a Cuckold, And who can help it? must it begin so needs Sir?â thinke agen. Ant. Yes marry must it, and I my selfe will woe this woman for you, do you perceive it now? ha? Mer. Yes now I have a little sight i'th matter; o that thy head should be so monstrous, that al thy Servants hatts may hang upon't! but do you meane to do this? Ant. Yes certaine, I will woe her, and for you, strive not against it, 'tis the overthrow of the best plott that ever was then. Mer. Nay I'le assure you Sir, I'le do no harme, you have too much about you of your owne. Ant. Have you thought of a place yet? Mer. A place? Ant. I a place where you will bide, pre'thee no more of this modesty, 'tis foolish, and we were not determinde to be absolute friends indeed, 'twere tolerable. Mer. I have thought, and you shall heare from me. Ant. Why? this will gaine me everlasting glory; I have the better of him, that's my comfort, good night. Exit. Mer. Good night, well go thy wayes, thou art the tydiest wittall this day I thinke above ground, and yet thy end for all this must bee mottly. Exit. Enter a Tincker, with a cord, and Dorathy. Tinck.

Hurt her not, if thou dost by Ale and Beare Ile clout thy old bald braine pan, with a peece of brasse, you bitch incarnate. Exeunt Tinker and Dorithy. Uiola. O God to what am I reserved, that knew not Through all my childish howers and actions More sinne then poore imagination, And too much loving of a faithlesse man? For which I am paid, and so, that not the day That now is rising to protect the harmelesse, And give the innocent a sanctuary From theeves and spoylers, can deliver me From shame, at least suspitionâ Enter Valerio. Val. Sirrah leade downe the horses easily, I'le walke a foot till I be downe the hill, tis very early, I shall reach home betimes. How now, whose there? Vio. Night that was ever friend to lovers, yet Has rais'd some weary soule, that hates his bed To come and see me blush, and then laugh at me. Val. H'ad a rude heart that did this. Vio. Gentle sir, If you have that which honest men call pitty, And be as far from evill as you shew; Helpe a poore maide, that this night by bad fortune Has beene thus us'd by Robbers. Val. A pox upon his heart that would not helpe thee, this theefe was halfe a Lawyer, by his bands, how long have you bin tyed here? Viol. Alas this hower, and with cold and feare am almost perisht. Val. Where were the watch the while? good sober Gent. they were like carefull members of the City, drawing in diligent ale and singing catches, while Mr. Constable contrived the tosts: these fellowes would bee more severely punisht then wandring Gipsies, that every statute whipps, for if they had every one two eyes a peece more, three pots would put them out. Viol. I cannot tell I found no Christian to give me succour. Val. When they take a theefe, I'le take Ostend agen; the whorsons drinke opium in their Ale, &amp; then they sleep like topps; as for their bills; they onely serve to reach downe Bacon to make Rashers on; now let mee know whom I have done this courtesie too, that I may thanke my early rising for it? Viol. Sir, All I am, you see. Val. You have a name I'm sure, and a kindred, a father, friend or something that must owne you; shee's a handsome young wench; what Rogues were these to Rob her? Vio. Sir you see all I dare reveale, And as you are a Gent presse me no further; For there begins a griefe whose bitternesse Will breake a stronger heart then I have in me, And twill but make you heavie with the hearing, For your owne goodnesse sake desire it not. Val. If you would not have me enquire that, how do you live then? Viol. How I have lived, is still one question, Which must not be resolu'dâ How I desire to live, is in your liking, So worthy an opinion I have of you, Val. Is in my liking? how I pray thee? tell me, ifaith I'le do you any good lys in my power; she has an eye would raise a bedrid man; come leave your feare and tell mee, thats a good wench. Uiol. Sir I would serveâ Ual. Who wouldst thou serve? doe not weepe and tell me. Uiol. Faith sir even some good woman, and such a wife if you be married, I doe imagine yours. Ual. Alas! thou art young and tender, let me see thy hand, this was neere made to wash or wind up water, beate cloaths, or rub a floore, by this light, for one use that shall be namelesse, tis the best wanton hand that ere I lookt on. Uio. Dare you accept me sir, my heart is honest, Among your vertuous charitable deeds; This will not be the least. Ual. Thou canst in a Chamber. Uio. In a Chamber sir. Ual. I meane waite there upon a Gentlewoman, How quick she is, I like that mainely too; Ile have her, though I keepe her with maine strength like a besieged towne, for I know I shall have the enemy afore me within a weeke. Uiol. Sir I can sow too, and make pretty laces, Dresse a head handsome, teach young gentlewomen, For in all these I have a little knowledge. Ual. Tis well, no doubt I shall encrease that knowledge; I like her better still, how she provokes me; pritty youngmaid you shall serve a good Gentlewoman, though I say't that will not be unwilling you should please mee, nor I forgetfull if you doe. Uiol. I am the happier. Ual. My man shall make some shift to carry you behind him, can you ride well? Uiola. But I'le hold fast for catching of a fall. Ual. That's the next way to pull another on you, I'le worke her as I go I know shee's wax, now, now, at this time could I begett a worthy on this wench. Uiol. Sir for this Gentlenesse, may heaven requite you tenfold. Ual. 'Tis a good wench however others use thee, be sure I'le bee a loving master to thee, come. Exeunt.

Pray God it take, I have given her, that will stirr her conscience, how it workes with her; hope if it be thy will let the flesh have it. Mar.

Locke him up safe enough I'le to this Gentleman, I know the reson of all this businesse, for I do suspect it, If he have this plott, I'le ring him such a peale, shall make his eares deafe for a moneth at least. Exit. Enter Richardo. Ric. Am I not mad? can this weake temper'd head, That will be mad with drink, endure the wrong That I have done a virgin and my love? Be mad, for so thou ought'st, or I vvill beate The vvalls and trees, dovvne vvith thee, and vvill let Either thy memory out or madnesse in, But sure I never lov'd faire Uiola: I never lov'd my Father nor my Mother, Or any thing but drinke; had I had love; Nay, had I knovvne so much charity, As would have sav'd an Infant from the fire, I had bin naked, raving in the street: With halfe a face, gashing my selfe with knives, Two howers ere this time. Enter Pedro, Siluio, Vberto. Ped. Good morrow Sir. Rich. Good morrow Gentlemen, shal we go drink agen? I have my witts. Ped. So have I but they are unsetled ones, would I had some porrige. Rich. The taverne boy was here this morning with mee And told me that there was a Gentlewoman, Which he tooke for a whore that hung on me: For whom we quarrel'd, and I know not what. Ped. I faith nor I. Ube. I have a glimmering of some such thing. Rich. Was it you Silvio, That made me drinke so much? 'twas you or Pedro. Ped. I know not who. Sil. We were all apt enough. Rich. But I will lay the fault on none but me, That I would be so entreated, come Silvio, Shall we goe drinke agen, come Gentlemen, Why do you stay, let's never leave off now, Whilst we have Wine and throates, I'le practise it, Till I have made it my best quality; For what is best for me to do but that? For Gods sake come and drinke; when I am nam'd Men shall make answer, which Richado meane you? The excellent drinker? I will have it so, Will you goe drinke? Silv. We drunke too much too lately. Rich. Why there is then the lesse behind to drinke, Let's end it all, dispatch that, wee'l send abroad, And purchase all the Wine the world can yield, And then drinke it off, then take the fruits o'the earth, Distill the Juice from them, and drinke that off; Wee'l catch the raine before it fall to ground, And drinke off that that never more may grow; Wee'l set our mouths to Springs, and drinke them off, And all this while wee'l never thinke of those That love us best, more then we did last night. We will not give unto the poore a drop Of all this drinke, but when we see them weepe, Weel run to them, and drinke their teares off too, Wee'l never leave whilst there is heate or moysture, In this large globe, but suck it cold and dry, Till we have made it Elementall earth, Meerly by drinking. Ped. Is't flattery to tell you, you are mad? Rich. If it be false, There's no such way to bind me to a man; He that will have me, lay my goods and lands, My life down for him, need no more, but say Richardo thou art mad, and then all these Are at his service, then he pleases me, And makes me thinke that I had vertue in me, That I had love, and tendernesse of heart, That though I have committed such a fault, As never creature did, yet runinng mad, As honest men should doe for such a crime, I have exprest some worth, though it be late: But I alas have none of these in me, But keep my wits still like a frozen man, That had no fire within him. Sil. Nay good Richardo leave this wild talk, and send a letter to her, I'le deliver it. Rich. 'Tis to no purpose; perhaps she's lost last night, Or she got home agen, she's now so strictly Look'd to, the wind can scarce come to her, or admit She were her selfe; if she would hear from me, From me unworthy, that have us'd her thus, She were so foolish, that she were no more To be beloved. Enter Servant with a Night-gown. Ser. Sir, we have fo?d this night-gown she took with her. An. Where? Rich. Where? where? speake quickly. Ser. Searching in the Suburbs, we found a Tinker and his whore, that had in it a sap-house, whom we apprehended, and they confest they stole it from her. Rich. And murthered her? Sil. What aile you Man? Rich. Why all this doth not make me mad. Sil. It does, you would not offer this else, good Pedro looke to his sword. Ser. They do deny the killing of her, but swore they left her tyed to a tree, in the fields, next those Suburbs that are without our Ladies gate, neer day, &amp; by the rode, so that some passinger must needs unty her quickly. And. The will of heaven be done? Sir I wil only entreat you this, that as you were the greatest occasion of her losse, that you will be pleased to urge your friends, and be your selfe earnest in the search of her; if she be found, she is yours, if she please, I my selfe only; see these people better examin'd, and after follow some way in search, God keepe you Gentlemen. Exit. Sil. Alas good man! Ric. VVhat think you now of me, I think this lump Is nothing but a piece of fleagme congeal'd VVithout a soule, for where theres so much spirit As would but warm a flea, those faults of mine VVould make it glow and flame in this dull heart, And run like molten gold through every sin, Till it could burst these walls and fly away. Shall I intreat you all to take your horses, And search this innocent? Ped. VVith all our hearts. Ric. Do not devide your selves till you come there, VVhere they say she was ty'd, I'le follow too, But never to return till she be found. Give me my sword good Pedro, I will do No harme believe me with it, I am now Farre better temper'd, If I were not so, I have enow besides, God keep you all, And send us good successe. Exeunt.</field>

A Gentleman I'le lay my life you puppy, h'as sent his wife to me: if he have, fling up the bed. Ser. Here she is Sir. Enter VVife with a letter. VVife. I am glad I found you Sir, there take your letter and keepe it till you have another friend to wrong, 'tis too malicious false to make me sin, you have provoked mee to be that I love not, a talker, and you shall heare me. VVhy should you dare to imagine me So light a huswife, that from four hours knowledge You might presume to offer to my credite This rude and ruffian tyrall, I am sure I never courted you, nor gave you tokens, That might concerne assurance, you are a foole. Mer. I cannot blame you now, I see this letter Though you be angry, yet with me you must not, Unlesse you'l make me guilty of a wrong, My worst affections hateâ VVife. Did not you send it? Mer. No upon my faith, which is more, I understand it not; the hand is as far from my knowledge, as the malice. Wife. This is strange. Mer. It is so, and had been stranger, and indeed more hatefull, Had, that have receiv'd such courtesies, &amp; owe so many Thanks, done this base office. Wife. Your name is at it. Mer. Yes, but not my nature, and I shall hate my name worse then the manner, for this base broking; you are wise and vertuous, remove this fault from me; for on the love I beare to truth and goodnesse, this letter dare not name me for the author. Wife. Now I perceive my husbands knavery, if my man can but finde where he has been, I will goe with this Gentleman whatsoever comes on't: and as I meane to carry it both he and all the world shall thinke it fit, and thank me for it. Mer. I must confesse I loved you, at first, however this made me leave your house unmannerly, that might provoke me to do something ill, both to your honour &amp; my faith, and not to write this letter, which I hold so truly wicked, that I will not thinke on't. Wife. I do beleeve you, and since I see you are free, my words were not meant to you, but this is not the halfe of my affliction. Mer. 'Tis pitty you should know more vexation; may I enquire? Wife. Faith Sir I feare I have lost my husband. Mer. Your husband? it cannot be: I pitty her, how shee's vext? Enter Servant. Wife. How now? what news? nay speake, for we must know. Ser. Faith I have found at length by chance where he has been Wife. Where? Ser. In a blind out-house in the Suburbs, pray God all be well with him. Wife. Why? Ser. There are his cloaths, but what's become of him, I cannot yet enquire. Wife. I am glad of this; sure they have murtherd him, what shall I do? Mer. Be not so grieved before you know the truth, you have time enough to weepe, this is the sodainst mischiefe; did you not bring an Officer to search there, where you say you found his cloaths. Ser. Yes, and wee searcht it, and charg'd the fellow with him. but he like a rogue, stubborn rogue, made answer, he knew not where he was; he had been there, but where he was now, he could not tell: I tell you true I fear him. Wife. Are all my hopes and longings to enjoy him, After this 3 yeares travell, come to this? Ser. It is the rankest house in all the City, the most cursed roguy bawdi-house? hell fire it. Mer. This is the worst I heard yet; will you go home? I'le beare you company, and give you the best help I may: this being here will wrong you. Wife. As you are a Gentleman, and as you loved your dead friend, let me not goe home, that will but heape one sorrow on another. Mer. Why purpose any thing and I'le perform't; I am at my wits end too. Ser. So am I, O my deare Master! Mer. Peace you great foole. Wife. Then good Sir cary me to some retired place, far from the sight of this unhappy City, whether you will indeed, so it be far enough. Mer. If I might councel you, I think 'twere better to go home, and try what may be done yet, hee may bee at home afore you, who can tell? Wife. O no, I know he's dead, I know hee's murder'd; tell me not of going home, you murder me too. Mer. Well, since it pleases you to have in so, I will no more perswade you to go home, I'le be your guide in the Countrey, as your griefe doth command me, I have a Mother dwelling from this place some 20. miles, the house though homely, yet able to shew something like a welcome: thither I'le see you safe with all your sorrows. Wife. With all the speed that may be thought upon; I have a Coach here ready, good Sir quickly, I'le fit you my fine husband. Mer. It shall be so; if this fellow be dead, I see no band of any other man, to tye me from my will, and I will follow her with such carefull service, that she shall either be my Love or Wife; will you walke in? Wife. I thank you Sir, but one word with my man, and I am ready; keepe the Irish fellow safe, as you love your life, for he I feare has a deep hand in this, then search agen, &amp; get out warrants for that naughty man, that keeps the bad house, that he may answer it, if you find the body, give it due buriall; farewell. You shall heare from mee, keep all safe. Exeunt. Ser. O my sweet Mr! Antonio knocking within. Ant. within.

Goe, you are Knaves both, but I forgive you, I am almost mad with the apprehension of what I shall be, not a word I charge you. Exeunt. Enter Valerio, and Viola. Val. Come pretty soul, we now are neer our home, And whilst our horses are walkt downe the hill, Let thou and I walke here over this Close: The foot-way is more pleasant, 'tis a time My pretty one, not to be wept away, For every living thing is full of love; Art not thou so too? hah? Uio. Nay, there are living things empty of love, Or I had not been here, but for my selfe! Alas, I have too much. Val. It cannot be, that so much beauty, so much youth and grace should have too much of love. Vio. Pray what is love? for I am full of that I doe not know. Val. Why, love faire maid is an extream desire, That's not to be examin'd but fulfil'd, To aske the reason why thou art in love, Or what might be the noblest end in love, Would overthrow that kindly rising warmth, That many times slides gently o're the heart, 'Twould make thee grave, &amp; staid thy thoughts would be, Like a thrice married Widow, full of ends, And void of all compassion, and to fright thee From such enquiry, whereas thou art now Living in ignorance, mild, fresh, and sweet, And but sixteen, the knowing what love is, Would make thee sixe and forty. Vio. Would it would make me nothing, I have heard Schollers affirme the world is upheld by love, But I beleeve women maintain all this, For ther's no love in men. Val. Yes, in some men. Vio. I know them not. Ual. Why, there is love in me. Uio. Ther's charity I am sure towards me. Ual. And love; which I will now expresse, my pretty maide, I dare not bring thee home, my Wife is foule, And therefore envious, she is very old, And therefore Jealous; thou art faire and young, A subject fit for her unlucky vices. To worke upon, she never will endure thee. Uio. Shee may endure If she be ought, but Divell, all the friendship That I will hold with you; can she endure I should be thankfull to you? may I pray For you and her, will she be brought to thinke That all the honest industry I have Deserves browne bread? if this may be endur'd, Shee'l picke a quarrell with a sleeping childe, E're she fall out with me. Val. But trust me she doe's hate all handsomenesse. Vio. How fell you in love with such a creature? Val. I never lov'd her. Vio, And yet married her? Val. Shee was a rich one. Vio. And you swore I warrant you, she was a faire one then too. Val. Or beleeve me I thinke I had not had her. Uio. Are you men all such? wood you wood wall us in a place Where all we women, that are innocent, Might live together. Ual. Do not weep at this, Although I dare not for some weighty reason Displease my Wife, yet I forget not thee. Uio. VVhat will you do with me? Ual. Thou shalt be plac'd At my mans house, and have such food and rayment As can be bought with money: these white hands Shall never learn to worke, but they shall play As thou saist they were wont, teaching the strings To move in order, or what else thou wilt. Uio. I thanke you Sir, but pray you cloath me poorly, And let my labour get me meanes to live. Ual. But faire one, you I know do so much hate A foule ingratitude, you will not looke I should do this for nothing. Uio. I will worke as much out as I can, and take as litle That you shall have as duly paid to you As ever servant did. Ual. But give me now a tryall on't, I may beleeve We are alone, shew me how thou wilt kisse And hug me hard, when I have stolne away From my too clamorous Wife that watches me, To spend a blessed houre or two with thee. Uio. Is this the love you mean? you would have that Is not in me to give, you would have lust. Val. Not to dissemble, or to mince the word, 'Tis lust I wish indeed. Vio. And by my troth I have it not: for heavens sake use mee kindely. Though I be good, and shew perhaps a monster, As this world goes. Val. I doe But speak to thee; thy answers are thy owne, I compell none, but if thou refuse this motion, Thou art not then for me, alas good soule? What profit can thy worke bring me. Uio. But I feare I pray goe, for lust they say will grow Outragious being deni'd, I give you thankes For all your courtesies, and there's a Jewell That's worth the taking, that I did preserve Safe from the robbers, pray you leave me here Just as you found me, a poor innocent, And Heaven will blesse you for it. Val. Pretty maid I am no Robber nor no Ravisher, I pray thee keepe thy Jewel, I have done No wrong to thee, though thou beest vertuous And in extremity, I doe not know, That I am bound to keepe thee. Viol. No sir, for gods sake if you know an honest man in all these countries, give me some directions to find him out. Val. More honest then my selfe good sooth I doe not know; I would have lain with thee with thy consent, and who would not in all these parts, is past my memory, I am sorry for thee, farwell gentle maid, god keepe thee safe. Exit. Vio. I thanke you sir, and you; Woman they say, was onely made of man, Me thinks tis strange they should be so unlike, It may be all the best was cut away To make the woman and the nought was left Behind with him, I'le sit me downe and weepe, All things have cast me from 'em but the earth; The evening comes and every little flower Droops now, as well as I. Enter two Milkmaides with pailes. Nan.

Nan. If I had but one Cows Milke in all the world, you should have some on't; there drink more, the cheese shall pay for it, alas poore heart! shees dry. Mag. Doe you dwell here abouts? Vio. No, would I did. Nan. Madge if she do not looke like my cosen Sue o'th more lane as one thing can looke like anotherâ Mag. Nay Sue has a hazell eye, I know Sue well, and by your leave not so trim a body neither, this is a feate bodied thing I tell you. Nan. She laces close by the masse I warrant you, and so does Sue too. Vio. I thanke you for your gentlenesse faire maids. Nan. Drinke agen pray thee. Vio. I am satisfied, and heaven reward thee for't, yet thus far I will compell you to accept these trifles, toyes onely that expresse my thanks, for greater worth, I'm sure they have not in them; indeed you shall, I found e'm as I came. Nan. Madge, look you here Madge. Mag. Nay I have as fine a one as you, mine's all gold and painted, and pretious stone in't; I warrant it cost a crowne wench. Nan. But mine is the most sumptuous one that ere I saw. Uiol. One favour you must doe me more, for you are well acquainted here. Nan. Indeed wee'le doe you any kindnesse sister. Vio.

And dresse a house with flowers? and serve a pigg? this you must doe, for we deale in the dary, and make a bed or two? Vio. I hope I shall. Nan. But be sure to keepe the men out, they will mar all that you make else, I know that by myselfe; for I have been so touz'd among e'm in my days, come you shall een home with us and be our fellow, our house is so honest, and we serve a very good woman, and a Gentlewoman, and we live as merrily, and dance a good dayes after evensong, our wake shall be on Sunday; doe you know what a wake is? we have mighty cheer then, and such a coyle, 'twould blesse ye; you must not be so bashfull, you'l spoile all. Mag. Let's home for Gods sake, my Mistris thinkes by this time we are lost, come wee'l have a care of you, I warrant you; but you must tell my Mistris where you were borne, and every thing that belongs to you, &amp; the strangest things you can devise, for she loves those extreamly, 'tis no matter whether they be true or no, shee's not so scrupulous; you must be our sister, and love us best, and tell us every thing, and when cold weather comes wee'l ly together, will you do this?

Ual. Sir I will thinke so now, and credit me, You have so wrought me with your griefe, that I Do both forgive and pitty you: And if youle please to take a bed this night heere; Too morrow I'le bring you where I left her. Rich. I thanke you, no, shall I be so unworthy, To think upon a bed, or ease or comfort, And have my heart stray from me God knowes where, Cold and forsaken, destitute of friends, And all good comforts else, unlesse some tree Whose speechlesse charity must better ours, With which the bitter east winds made their sport And sung through hourely, hath invited her To keep off halfe a day? shall shee be thus, And I draw in soft slumbers? God forbid. No, night and bitter coldnesse I provoke thee, And all the dewes that hang upon thy locks, Showers, hailes, snowes, frosts, &amp; two edged windes that prime The maiden blossoms, I provoke you all, And dare expose this body to your sharpnesse, 'Till be made a land marke. Ual. Will you then stay and eate with mee? Rich. Y'are angry with me, I know you'r angry, You would not bid me eate else; my poore Mistris, For ought I know thou art famish't, for what else Can the feilds yeeld thee, and the stubborne season, That yet holds in the fruite? good Gentle Sir, Thinke not ill manners in mee for denying Your offer'd meate, for sure I cannot eate While I do thinke she wants; well I'me a rascall; A villaine, slave, that onely was begotten, To murder women and of them the best. Val. This is a strange affliction. If you'le accept no greater courtisy, yet drink Sir. Ric. Now I am sure you hate me, and you knew What kinde of man I am, as indeed 'tis fitt, That every man should know me to avoide me. If you have peace within you Sir, or goodnesse Name that abhor'd word drinke no more unto mee, You had safer strike me. I pray you do not, if you love me do not. Ual. Sir, I meane no ill by it. Rich. It may be so, Nor let me see None sir, if you love heaven; You know not what offence it is unto mee, Nor good now, do not aske me why: And I warne you once againe, let no man else speake of't, I feare your servants will be prating to me. Ual. Why Sir what aile you? Rich. I hate drinke, ther's the end on't, And that man that drinkes with meate is dambn'd without an age of prayers and repentance, And ther's a hazard too; good Sir no more, If you will do me a free courtisy; That I shall know for one, go take your horse, And bring me to the place where you left her: Val. Since you are so importunate I will; But I will wish Sir you had stay'd to night Upon my credit, you shall see no drinke. Rich. Be gon the hearing of it makes me giddy, Sir will you be intreated to forbeare it, I shall be mad else. Val. I pray no more of that, I am quiet, I'le but walke in and away straight. Rich. Now I thanke you, But what you do, do in a twinckling, Sir. Ual. As soone as may bee. Exeunt. Enter Mother, Viola, and 2. Milckmaides. Moth.

Allex. No truly this will neere be mended. Uiola. Truly I meant but to wash it for the Gentlewoman, that is sick above, and shaking out the water, knockt it against the paile side. Moth. Did you so? be sure I'le stop it, 'twill make a good gap in your quarters wages, can tell you. Uiola. I pray forgive me, and let me have no wages this first quarter. Moth.

Enter Uiola, weeping. Uiola. I have done another fault, I beseech you sweete Mistris of give me. Mother. What's the matter. Uiola. As I was reaching for the bread that lay upon the shelfe, I have throwne downe the minct meate, that should have made the pyes to morrow. Moth. Get thee out of my house thou filthy destroying Harlot, thou, I'le not keepe thee an howre longer. Uiola. Good Mistris beate me rather for my fault as much as it deserves, I do not know whether to go. Moth. No I warrant thee, out of my dores. Uiola. Indeed I'le mend, I pray speake you for me. Allex. If thou had'st hurl'd downe any thing but the pye meate, I would have spoake for thee, but I cannot finde in my hart now. Moth. Art thou here yet? I thinke I must have an officer to thrust thee out of my dores, must I? Uiola. Why you may stop this in my wages too, For Gods sake do, I'le finde my selfe this yeare; And let me stay. Mer. Thou't spoyle ten times as much, I'le cudgell thee out of my dores. Uiola. I am assur'd you are more mercifull, Then thus to beate me and discharge me too. Moth. Dost thou dispute with mee, Allexander, carry the prating hilding forth. Uiola. Good Mistris heere me I have heard a Jewell, My Mother left me and 'tis something worth: Receive it and when all my faulte together Come to the worth of that, then turne me forth, 'Till then I pray you keep mee. Moth. What giggombob have wee here? pray god you have not pilfer'd this some where; th'art such a pulling thing, wipe your eyes, and rise go your wayes, Allexander, bid the Cook mince some more meate, come and get you to bed quickly that you may up betime i'th morning a milking or you and I shall fall out worse yet. Exit Mother and Allexander. Uiola. She has hurt my arme; I am a fraid, she is a very angry woman, but blesse him heaven that did me the most wrong, I am a fraide Antonibus wife should see mee, she will knowe mee. Mother within. Melvia. Uiola. I am coming, shee's not angry agen I hope. Exit. Enter Mercury. Mer. Now what am I the better for enjoying This woman that I lov'd? so all I finde, That I before immaginde to be happy: Now I have done, it turnes to nothing else But a poore pittied and a base repentance, Udsfoote I am monstrous angry with my selfe: Why should a man that has discourse and reason, And knowes how neere he looses all in these things, Covet to have his wishes satisfied; Which when they are, are nothing but the shame I do begin to loath this woman straingly, And I thinke justly too, that durst adventure, Flinging away her modesty to take A stranger to her bed, her husbands body Being scarce cold in the earth for her content, It was no more to take my sences with, Then if I had an idle dream had in sleep Yet I have made her promises: which grieves me, And I must keep 'em too, I thinke she hunts me: The Devill cannot keep these women off, When they are fletched once. Enter VVife in night atire. VVife. To bed for gods sake, Sir, why do you stay heer? Some are up i'th house, I hard the wife, Good deare sweete hart to bed. Merc. Why I am going? why do you follow me? You would not have it knowne I hope, pray get you Back to your chamber, the dores hard by for mee, Let me alone I warrant you, this it is To thresh well, have got a customer, Will you go to bed? VVife. Will you? Mer. Yes I am going. VVife. Then remember your promise you made to marry mee. Mer. I will, but it was your fault, that it came To this pinch now, that it must neede remembrance: For out of honesty I offer'd you To marry you first, why did you slacke that offer? Wife. Alas I told you the inconvenience of it, And what wrong it would appeare to the world If I had married you in such post hast After his death: beside, the foolish people VVould have beene bold to have thought wee had lyen together in his time, and like enough imagin'd VVe two had murthered him. Mer. I love her tongue yet, If I were a Saint A gilded Saint, and such a thing as this Should prate thus wittily and feelingly Unto my holinesse, I cannot tell, But I feare shrewdly I should doe something That would quite scratch me out o'the Kallender, And if I stay longer talking with her, Though I am mad at what I have done already, Yet I shall forget my selfe againe; I feele the Divell Ready to hold my stirrop; pray to bed, god-night. Wife. This kisse, god-night sweet Love, And peace goe with thee: thou hast prov'd thy selfe The honestest man that ever was entic'd To that sweet sin as people please to call it, Of lying with anothers VVife, and I, I thinke the honestest woman without blushing, That ever lay with another man, I sent my husband Into a Cellar, post, fearing, and justly, He should have knowne him, which I did not purpose Till I had had my end. VVell, now this plot is perfect, let him bragge on't. Exit.</field>

Just. You say true, when set you out my friend? Cur. About ten a clock and I have rid all night. Just. By the masse you are tough indeed, I have seene the day, I would have rid too with the proudest of them and fling durt in their faces, and I have don't with this foolish boy sir many a time; but what can last alwayes? 'tis done, 'tis done now Sir, age, care, and office, brings us to our footecloathes, the more the pitty. Curio. I believe that Sir, but will it please you to read the businesse? Just. My friend I can read an I can tell you when. Cur. Would I could too Sir, for my hast requires it. Just. Whence comes it do you say? Cur. Sir from the Citty. Justice. O from the City 'tis a reverent place. Curio. And his justice bee as short as his memory, A Dudgion Dagger will serve him to mow downe sinne withall. What clod pole Commissioner is this? Just. And by my faith govern'd by worthy member, Discreete and upright. Curio. Sir they are beholding to you, you have given some of them a commendations, they were not worthy of this twenty yeares. Just. Go to go to, you have a merry meaning, I have found you sir ifaith, you are a wag, away, fye, now I'le read Your letter. Curio. Pray do sir; what a misery 'tis, To have an urgent businesse, wait the Justice, Of such an old Tuff taffity that knowes not, Nor can be brought to understand more sence, Then how to restore supprest Ale-houses, And have his man compound small trespasses, For ten groates. Just. Sir it seems here your businesse is of deeper circumstance then I conceiv'd it for; what do you meane Sir? Cur. 'Tis for mine owne ease I'le assure your VVorship. Just. It shall not be ifaith friend, here I have it, That one Antonio a Gentleman, I take it so, Yes it is so, a Gentleman is lately thought to Have been made away, and by my faith upon a Perles ground too, if you consider; wel, there's Knavery in't, I see that without spectacles. Cur. Sure this fellow deals in revelation he's so hidden, Goe thy wayes, thou wilt sticke a bench spit as formally, And shew thy agot, and hatch'd chaine As well as the best of them. Just. And now I have considered, I beleeve it. Cur. VVhat Sir? Just. That he was murdered. Cur. Did you know him? Just. No. Cur. Nor how it is suppos'd. Just. No, nor I care not two-pence, those are toyes and yet I verily beleeve hee was murdered, as sure as I beleeve thou art a man, I never failde in these things yet, weare a man that's beaten to these matters, experience is a certain conceal'd thing that failes not; pray let me aske you one thing, why doe you come to me? Cur. Because the letter is addrest to you, being the nearest Justice. Iust. The nearest? is that all? Cur. I thinke it be Sir, I would be loth you should bee the wisest. Iust. Well Sir, as it is, I will endeavour in it; yet if it had come to me by name, I know not, but I thinke it had beene as soone dispatcht as by another, and with as round a wisedome, I, and as happily, but that's all one: I have borne this place this thirty yeares, and upwards, and with sufficient credit: and they may when they please, know me better; to the nearest? well. Curio. Sir, it is not my fault, for had I knowne you soonerâ Iust. I thanke you Sir, I know it. Cur. I'le besworne you should have plaid for any businesse now. Iustice. And further, they have specified unto mee, his Wife is sorely suspected in this matter, as a maine cause, Curio I think e she be Sir, for no other cause can be yet found. Iust. And one Mercury a traveller, with whom they say directly shee is runne away, and as they thinke this way. Cur. I knew all this before. Iustice. Well Sir, this Mercury I know, and his breeding, a neighbours childe hard by, you have been happy Sir in comming hither. Cur. Then you know where to have him Sir? Iust. I do Sir, he dwells neare me. Cur. I doubt your Worship dwels neare a Knave then. Iust. I think so; pray put on: but 'tis a wonder To see how gracelesse people are now given, And how base vertue is accounted with them That should be all in all as sayes a wise man. I tell you Sir, and it is true, that there have beene such murthers, and of late dayes, as 'twould make your very heart bleede in you, and some of them as I shall bee enabled I will tell you, it fell out of late dayes. Cur. It may be so, but will it please you to proceede in this? Iust. An honest Weaver, and as good as work-man as ere shot shuttle, and as close: but every man must dye; this honest Weaver being a little mellow in his Ale, that was the evidence verbatim, Sir, God blesse the marke, sprung his necke just in this place: wel Iarvis, thou hadst wrongs, &amp; if I live some of the best shall sweat fort, then a wenchâ Cur. But Sir you have forgot my businesse. Iust. A sober pretty maide about 17. they say, certainly howsoever 'tis shuffled, shee burst her selfe, and fondly, if it be so, with Furmety at a Churching, but I thinke the Divell had another agent in't: either of which if I can catch shall stretch for't. Cur. This is a mad Justice that will hang the Devill; but I would you would be short in this, before that other notice can be given? Iustice. Sir I will doe discreetly what is fitting; what, Antonio? Ant. within. Your Worship? Iust. Put on your best coate, and let your fellow Marke goe to the Constable &amp; bid him aide me with all the speed hee can, and all the power, and provide pen and inke to take their Confessions, and my long sword, I cannot tell what danger wee may meete with; you'le goe with us? Curio. Yes, what else? I came to that end to accuse both parties. Iust. May I crave what you are? Cur. Faith Sir one that to be knowne would not profit you, more then a meere Kinsman of the dead Antonio's. Iust. 'Tis well, I am sorry for my neighbour, truly, that hee had no more grace, 'twill kill his Mother, shee's a good olde woman, will you walke in? I'le but put my Cloake on, and my Chaine off, and a cleane band, and have my shooes blackt over, and shift my Jerkin, and wee'l to our businesse, and you shall see how I can bolt these matters. Cur. As soone as't please you Sir. Exit. Enter Valerio, and Richardo. Val. This is the place; here did I leave the Maid Alone last night drying her tender eyes, Uncertaine what to do, and yet desirous To have me gone. Rich. How rude are all we men, That take the name of Civill to our selves? If she had set her foote upon an earth Where people live that we call barbarous; Though they had had no house to bring her too, They would have spoil'd the glory that the spring Has deckt the trees in, and with willing hands Have torne their branches downe, and every man Would have become a builder for her sake. What time left you her there? Val. I left her, when the Sun had so much to set, As he is now got from his place of rise. Rich. So near the night she could not wander far; Faire Viola? Val. It is in vaine to call, she sought a house Without all question. Rich. Peace, faire Viola? Faire Viola? who should have left her here On such a ground? if you had meant to loose her, You might have found there were no Inches here To take her name and carry it about, When her true Lover came to mourn for her, Till all the neighbouring valleys and the hills, Resounded Viola,â And such a place, You should have choseâ You pity us because The dew a little wets our feete, Unworthy far to seeke her in the wet; And what becomes of her? where wandred she, With 2 showers raining on her, from her eyes Continually, abundantly, from which There's neither tree nor house to shelter her; Will you goe with me to travell? Val. Whither? Rich. Over all the world. Val. No by my faith, I'le make a shorter journey When I do travell. Rich. But theres no hope To gaile my end in any shorter way. Val. Why, what's your end? Rich. It is to search the earth, Till we have found two in the shapes of men, As wicked as our selves. Val. 'Twere not so hard to find out those. Rich. Why, if we finde them out, It were the better; for what brave villany, Might wee 4. do? wee wood not keepe together: For every one has treachery enough For 20. Countryes, one should trouble Asia, Another should sowe strife in Affrica; But you should play the knave, at home in Europ, And for America let me alone. Uale. Sir I am honester, Then you know how to bee, and can no more Bee wrong'd but I shall finde my selfe a right. Rich. If you had any sparke of honesty, You would not think that honester then I, Were a praise high enough to serve your turne: if men were commonly so bad as I, Theeves would be put in Callenders for Saints; And bones of murderers would worke miracles. I am a kinde of knave, of knave so muchâ There is betwixt mee and the vilest else, But the next place of all to mine is yours. Enter 2. Milkemaides, and Uiola, with pailes. Ual. That last is she, 'tis shee. Rich. Let us away, we shall infect her, let her have the winde, And wee will kneele downe here. Uiola. Wenches away for here are men. Ualerio. Faire maide I pray you stay. Uio. Alas, agen? Rich. Why do you lay hold on her? I pray hartily let her go. Ual. With all my heart, I do not meane to hurt her. Rich. But stand away then for the purest bodyes VVill soonest take infection, stand away, But for infecting her my selfe, by heaven, I would come there and beate thee further off. Uiola. I know that voyce and face. Ual. You are finely mad, godbwy Sir, now you are here together, I'e leave you so, god send you good lucke, both when you are soberer, you'le give me thanks. Exit. Madge. VVilt thou go milke? come. Nan. VVhy dost not come? Madge. She nods, shee's a sleepe. Nan. VVhat, wert up so early? Madge. I think your man's mad to kneele there, nay come away ves body, Nan, help she looks black 'ith face, Shee's in a sound. Nan. And you bee a man com hither, &amp; helpe a woman. Rich. Come hither? you are a foole. Nan. And you a knave and a beast that you are. Rich. Come hither? 'twas being my now so neare, That made her sowne, and you are wicked people, Or you wood do so too, my venom eyes Strike innocency dead at such a distance, Here I'le kneele for this is out of distance. Nan. Th'art a prating Asse ther's no goodnesse in thee, I warrant, how dost thou? Uio. Why? well. Madge. Art thou able to go? Uio. No, pray go you and milke, if I be able to come I'le follow you, if not I'le sit here, 'Till you come back. Nan. I am loth to leave thee here with you wild foole. Uio. I know him well, I warrant thee, he will not hurt mee. Madge. Come then Nan. Exeunt Maides. Rich. How do you? be not fearefull, for I hold my hands Before my mouth and speake, and so My breath can never blast you. Uio. 'Twas enough to use me ill, though you had never sought me too mock me to, why kneele you so farr Off, were not that gesture better us'd in prayer, had dealt so with you, I should not sleep, till God and you had both forgiven me. Rich. I do not mock, nor lives there such a villane That can do any thing contemptible, To you, but I do kneele because it is, An action very fit, and reverent, In presence of so pure a creature, And so farr off, as fearefull to offend, One too much wrong'd already. Uio. You confesse you did the fault, yet scorne to come, So far as hither to aske pardon for't; Which I could willingly afford to come, To you to grant, good Sir if you have A better love, may you be blest together, Shee shall not wish you better then I will, I but offend you; there are all the Iewels I stole, and all the love I euer had, I leave behinde with you, I'le carry now To give another, may the next maide you try Love you no worse, nor be no worse then I. Rich. Do not leave me yet for all my fault, Search out the next things too impossible, And put me on them when they are effected, I may with better modesty receive Forgivenesse from you. Uio. I will set no pennance, To gaine the great forgivenesse you desire: But to come hither and take me and it, Or else I'le come and beg so you will grant, That you will be content to be forgiven. Rich. Nay I will come since you will haue it so, And since you please to pardon me I hope Free from infection, here I am by you; A carelesse man, a breaker of my faith, A lothsome drunkard and in that wild fury: A hunter after whores I do beseech you, To pardon all these faultes, and take me up An honest sober and a faithfull man. Uio. For gods sake urge your faultes no more, but mend, All the forgivenesse I can make you is, To love you which I will do and desire, Nothing but love againe, which if I have not, Yet I will love you still. Rich. O women that some one of you will take, An everlasting pen into your hands: And grave in paper which the writ shall make, More lasting then the marble monuments, Your matchlesse vertues to posterityes: Which the defective race of envious man, Strive to conceale. Uio. Me thinkes I would not now for any thing, But you had mist me, I have made a story, Will serve to wast many a winters fier When we are old, I'le tell my daughters then, The miseryes their Mother had in love: And say my girles bee wiser, yet I would not Have had more witt my selfe, take up those Iewells, For I thinke I heare my fellowes coming. Enter the Milkemaides with their pailes. Madge. How dost thou now? Uio. Why? very well I thanke you, 'tis late shall I hast home? Nan. I prethee vvee shall be shent soundly. Madge. VVhy doe's that railing man go vvith us? Uio. I preythee speake vvell of him, on my vvord, Hee's an honest man. Nan. There was never any so one's complexion, a Getleman? I'de be asham'd to have such a foule mouth. Exeunt. Enter Mother, Alexander, Andrugio, and his man Rowland. Moth. How now Alexander, what Gentleman is this? Alex. Indeed forsooth I know not, I found him at the market full of woe, crying a lost daughter, and telling all her tokens to the people; and wot you what? by all subscription in the world, it should be our new maid Melvia, one would little thinke it, therefore I was bold to tel him of her Mistriss. Mother. Melvia? it cannot be, foole, alas you know shee is a poore wench, and I tooke her in upon meere charity. And. So seem'd my daughter when shee went away, as she had made her selfe. Moth. What stature was your childe of, Sir? And. Not high, and of a browne complexion, Her haire aborne, a round face, which some friends that flattered mee, would say 'twould bee a good one. Alex. This is still Melvia, Mistriss, that's the truth on't. Moth. It may be so I'le promise you. Alex. Well, goe thy wayes, the flower of our towne, For a hand and a foote, I shall never see thy fellow. Moth. But had shee not such toyes, as bracelets, rings, and Jewels? And. Shee was something bolde indeed, to take such things that night she left me. Moth. Then belike she run away? And. Though she be one I love, I dare not lye, shee did indeed. Moth. What thinke you of this Jewel? And. Yes, this was one of them, and this was mine, you have made mee a new man, I thanke you for it. Moth. Nay, and she be given to filching, there is your Jewell, I am cleare on't: but by your leave Sir, you shall answer me for what is lost since she came hither, can tell you there lye things scattering in every place about the house. Alex. As I am vertuous, I have the lyingst olde Gentlewoman to my Mistris, and the most malicious, the Devill a good word will shee give a servant, that's her olde rule; and God be thanked they'l give her as few, there is perfect love on both sides, it yearns my heart to heare the wench misconstrued, a carefull soule shee is i'le besworne for her, and when shee's gone, let them say what they will, they may cast their Capps at such another. And. What you have lost by her, with all my heart I'le see you double paid, for you have sav'd With your kinde pitty two that must not live Unlesse it be to thanke you; take this Jewell, This strikes off none of her offences, Mistris, Would I might see her. Moth. Alexander, runne, and bid her make hast home, shee's at the milking Close; but tell her not by any means whoe's here, I know shee'l be too fearfull. Alex. Wel, wee'l have a posset yet at parting, that's my comfort, and one round, or else i'le loose my will. Exit. And. You shall finde Silvio, Uberto, and Pedro enquiring for the Wench at the next Towne, tell them shee is found, and where I am, and with the favour of this Gentlewoman, desire them to come hither, Mo. I pray doe, they shall be all welcome. Exit Servant. Enter Justice, Curio, and Mark. Justice. By your leave forsooth you shall see me find the parties by a slight. Moth. who's that? Mr. Justice? how do you Sir. Iust. Why very well, and busie, wher's your son. Moth. Hee's within Sir. Iust. Hum, and how does the young woman my Cozen that came downe with him. Moth. Shee's above, as a woman in her case may be. Iustice. You have confest it? then sirha call in the Officers; shee's no Couzen of mine; a meere tricke to discover all. Moth. To discover? what? Enter Marke and Officers. Iustice. You shall know that anon: I thinke you have over reached you; Ã´ welcome, enter the house, and by vertue of my warrant which you have there, seize upon the bodily persons of those whose names are there written, to wit, one Mercury, and the wife of one Antonio. Moth. For what. Iust. Away I say, This Gentleman shall certifie you for what. Exit Officer. Mother. Hee can accuse my Sonne of nothing, hee came from travell but within these two dayes? Iust. There hangs a tale. Moth. I should be sorry this should fall out at any time: but especially now Sir; will you favour mee so much, as to let me know of what you accuse him? Cur. Upon suspition of murther. Moth. Murther? I defie thee. Curio. I pray God hee may prove himselfe innocent. Iust. Fye, say not so, you shew your selfe to be no good Common-wealths man: for the more are hang'd, the better 'tis for the Common-wealth. Mother. By this rule you were best hang your selfe. Iust. I forgive your honest mirth ever: O, welcome, welcome Marke. Enter Marke and Officers, with Mercury and the Wife. Your penne, inke, and paper to take their examinations. Mer. Why do you pull me so? I'le goe alone. Iust. Let them stand, let them stand quietly, whilst they are examin'd? Wife. What will you examine us of? Iust. Of Antonio's murther. Mer. Why, he was my friend. Wife. He was my husband. Iust. The more shame for you both; Marke, your penne and inke. Moth. Pray God all be well, I never knew any of these Travellers come to good; I beseech you, Sir, be favourable to my Sonne. Iust. Gentlewoman hold you content, I would it were come to that? Mer. For gods sake mother why kneele you to such a pig bribe fellow? he has surfetted of geese, and they have put him into a fit of Justice, let him do his worst. Iust. Is your paper ready? Mark. I am ready Sir. Enter Antonio. Just. Accuse them Sir, I command thee to lay down acculations against these persons in behalfe of the State, and first looke upon the parties to be accus'd, and deliver your name. Cu. My name is Curio, my murthered Kinsman If he were living now, I should not know him, Tis so long since we saw one another. Ant. My cozen Curio? Cur. But thus much from the mouths of his servants, &amp; others, whose examinations I have in writing about me, I can accuse them of; this Mercury, the last night, but this last, lay in Antonio's house, and in the night he rose, raising Antonio, where privately they were in talke an houre, to what end I know not: but of likely-hood, finding Antonio's house not a fit place to murther him in, hee suffered him to goe to bed againe, but in the morning early, he train'd him I think forth, after which time hee never saw his home; his cloathes were found neere the place where Mercury was, and the people at first denyed they saw him: but at last he made a frivolous tale, that there he shifted himselfe into a foote-mans habit: but in short, the next houre this woman went to Mercury, and in her Coach they posted hither; true accusations, I have no more, and I will make none. Just. No more? wee need no more, Sirha, be drawing heir Mittimus before wee heare their answer: What say you Sir? are you guilty of this murther? Mer. No Sir. Just. Whether you are or no, confesse, it will bee the better for you. Mer. If I were guilty, your Rhetoricke could not fetch it forth: but though I am innocent, I confesse, that if I were a stander by, these circumstances urg'd, which are true, would make me doubtless beleeve the accused parties to be guilty. Just. Write downe, that hee being a stander by, for so you see he is, doth doubtlessely beleeve the accused parties, which is himselfe, to be guilty. Mer. I say no such thing. Just. Write it downe I say, wee'l try that. Mer. I care not what you write, pray God you did not kill him for my love, though I am free from this, we both deserve. Wife. Govern your tongue I pray you, all is well, my husband lives, I know it, and I see him. Just. They whisper, sever them quickly I say Officers why do you let them prompt one another, Gentlewoman, what say you to this, are not you guilty? Wife. No as I hope for mercy. Jus. But are not those circumstances true, that this Gentleman hath so shortly and methodically deliver'd? Wife. They are; and what you do with me I care not, Since he is dead, in whome was all my care: You knew him not. Jus. No an't bin better for you too, and you had never knew'd him. Wife. Why then you did not know the worlds chiefe joy His face so manly, as it had been made, To fright the world, yet he so sweetly temper'd; That he would make himselfe a naturall foole, To do a noble kindnesse for a friend, He was a man whose name I'le not out live, Longer then heaven whose will must be obay'd; Will have me do. Ant. And I will quit thy kindnesse. Just. Before me she has made the teares stand in mine eyes, but I must be austere Gentlewoman, you must confesse this murder. Wife. I cannot Sir, I did it not, but I desire to see those examinations which this Gentleman acknowledges to have about him, for but late last night I receiv'd letters from the Citty, yet I heard of no confession, then. Just. You shall see them time enough I warrant you, but letters you say you had, where are those letters? Wife. Sir they are gon. Just. Gone? whether are they gone? How have you dispos'd of 'em? Wife. Why Sir they are for womens matters, and so I use 'em. Just. Who writ em? Wife. A man of mine. Just. VVho brought 'em? Wife. A Post. Just. A Post? there was some great hast sure, a ha where is that Post? Wife. Sir there he stands. Just. Doe's hee so? bring hither that Post, I am afraid that Post will prove a knave; come hither Post, what? what can you say concerning the murder of Antonio? Ant. VVhats that to you? Just. O Post, you have no answer ready have you? I'le have one from you. Ant. You shall have no more from mee then you have, you examine an honest Gentleman and Gentlewoman heere, 'tis pitty such fooles as you should bee i'the commission. Just. Say you so Post, take away that Post, whip him and bring him againe quickly, I'le hamper you Post. Mer. 'Tis Antonio, I know him now as well, what an irregular foole is this? Ant. VVhip me? hold off. Wife. O good Sir whip him, by his murmuring he should know some thing of my husbands death; that may quit me, for gods sake fetch't out. Just. Whip him I say. Ant. who 'ist dares whip me now? Wife. O my lou'd husband. Mer. My most worthy friend? where have you been so long? Ant. I cannot speake for joy. Just. VVhy, what's the matter now, and shall not law then have her course? Andra. It shall have no other course then it has I thinke Just. It shall have other course before I go, or I'le beate my braines, and I say it was not honestly done of him to discover himselfe before the parties accus'd were executed that law might have had her course, for then the kingdome flourishes. Ant. But such a wife as thou, had never any man, and such a friend as he, beleeve me wife, shall never be a good wife, love my frend, friend love my wife, harke friend. Iust. Mark, if wee can have nothing to doe, you shall sweare the peace of some body. Mark. Yes Sir. Ant. By my troth I am sorry my wife is so obstinate, sooth if I could yet doe thee any good, I wood, faith I wood. Mer. I thanke you Sir, I have lost that passion. Ant. Couzen Curio, you and I must be better acquainted. Cur. It is my wish Sir. Ant. I should not have known you neither, 'tis so long since we saw, we were but children then: but you have shewd your selfe an honest man to me. Cur. I would be ever so. Enter Richardo and Viola. Moth. Looke you, whoe's there. And. Say nothing to me, for thy peace is made. Kic. Sir, I can nothing say, But that you are her Father, you can both Not only pardon, when you have a wrong, But love where you have most injury. Iust. I think I shall heare of no hanging this yeare, there A Tinker and a Whore yet, the Cryer said that rob'd her, and are in prison, I hope they shall be hang'd. And. No truly sir, they have broke prison. Inst. 'Tis no matter, then the Jaylor shall be hang'd. And. You are deceiv'd in that to sir, 'twas known to bee against his will, and he hath got his pardon, I thinke for nothing, but if it doth cost him any thing, I'le pay it. Just. Marke up with your papers, away. Mer. O you shal stay dinner, I have a couple of brawling neighbours, that I'le assure you will not agree, and you shall have the hearing of their matter. Just. With all my heart. Mer. Go, Gentlemen, go in. Rich. O Uiola, that no succeeding age, Might loose the memory of what thou wert, But such an overswayed sex is yours, That all the vertuous actions you can do, Are but as men will call them, and I sweare, 'Tis my beliefe that women want but wayes; To praise their deeds, but men want deeds to praise. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. This Comedy long forgot, by some thought dead, By us preserv'd, once more doth raise her head. And to your noble censures does present, Her outward forme, and inward ornament. Nor let this smell of arrogance, since 'tis known, The makers that confest it for their owne Were this way skilfull, and without the crime Of flatteries I may say did please the time; The worke it selfe too, when it first came forth, In the opinion of men of worth, Was well receiv'd, and favour'd, though some rude And harsh among the ignorant multitude, (That relish grosse food better then a dish, That's cook'd with care, and serv'd into the wish, Of curious pallats) wanting wit and strength, Truly to judge, condemn'd it for the length, That fault's reform'd, and now 'tis to be tri'd, Before such Judges 'twill not be deni'd A free and noble bearing, nor feare I, But 'twill deserve to have free liberty, And give you cause (and with content) to say, Their care was good that did revive this Play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue. 'Tis ended; but my hopes, and feares begin, Nor can it bee imputed as a sinne In me to wish it favour, if this night, To the Judicious it hath given delight, I have my ends, and may such for their grace, Vouchsafed to this, finde theirs in every place.</field>
