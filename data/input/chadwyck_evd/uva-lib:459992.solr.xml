      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS GRACE THE Duke of MONTAGU.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON THE Tragedy of EDWIN. By an unknown Hand. How happy were the Muses green Retreats, Where conqu'ring Monarchs fix'd their rural Seats! Where after Toils of War they strung the Lyre High as the warmest Fancy could inspire! Then the Parnassian Laurel, far renown'd, By turns Augustus and his Horace crown'd. But now to Merit blind, and deaf to Praise, Each Man his Fire in Bigot-Zeal conveys; And he who Censures most, most Wit displays. Who's eager now and zealous to Commend, Warm from the Soul and faithful to his Friend? And dare You rise in this degenerate Age, Like Light to guide us, and assert the Stage? For Madness some seem fond to be admir'd, Big with Extravagance, with Phrensy fir'd: To Thee the Muses more propitious smile, Sunk in the Virtues of a softer Stile. What heav'nly Transport all my Soul alarms? Thy Verse like Adeliza sweetly charms, And diff'rent Parties, like her Beauty, warms. What tho' no Thunder in thy Numbers roll; Yet copied there, the Image of thy Soul In native Innocence and Vigour shines, Nor wants a borrow'd Pomp to swell thy nervous Lines. Who can unmov'd with Pity see Thee bring Thro' gilded Scenes thy glitt'ring wretched King? Here he shines out in all the Pomp of State, There furious starts and raves for Elfrid's Fate. Who weeps not when your Captive Prince appears, Great tho' in Chains, and glorious tho' in Tears? His Love how tender, and how chaste the Flame! No Smoke of Lust deforms the virtuous Dame; She shines unsully'd like thy spotless Fame. O may no Envy thy Renown pursue, Tho' that must prove thy num'rous Praises due. But who, tho' dull to Merit, can refufe Tributes of Praise to so divine a Muse? Then let the wrangling Wretches do their worst, With canker'd Spite and native Dulness curst; Thy Verse its own Encomiums will suggest, And he who reads it most, shall praise it best.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE: Written by Mr.Theobald: Spoke by Mr. Ryan. Oft have you mourn'd, in this degenerate Age, How low is sunk the noble Tragic Rage; With Justice may we boast, in former Times, Heroes and Bards, the Product of these Climes: Whate'er Decay our Poets Honours stains, The Heroes Blood still runs in British Veins. Of our old Virtue there we stand possest; Brave, when most cool; unconquer'd, tho' deprest. How should we Athens in our Scenes outdo, Transmitting Deeds beyond what Greece e'er knew, Did but your well-known Worth and Martial Fire Burn in our Poets, and their Strains inspire! What Charm the Tragick Muse to this shall raise? What, but th'Applause of you who act the things you praise? Oft as the well-wrought Tale with artful Woe Makes beauteous Bosoms heave, and Eyes o'erflow, Dare to commend; nor think your Virtue less, Because your Hearts bleed at a feign'd Distress. Passion, when just, the lab'ring Soul beguiles; We groan with Pleasure; and we weep in Smiles. To-night the Muse a Saxon Monarch draws, Struggling with Griefs from a fictitious Cause; Alike in Love unhappy, and a Throne, Sinking by Crimes that hardly seem his own. If he appears unconscious of Offence, And stands the Mark of angry Providence; Pity the suff'ring Prince, and lay the Weight, Not on his Guilt, but his o'er-ruling Fate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE: Written by Mr. Molloy. Spoken by Mrs. Brett. Just taking Coachâour Author press'd my Stay, To beg your Votes in Favour of his Play. Hang me if I conceive what he can mean, For all dull Tragedies give me the Spleen. Howe'er, since I'm engag'd to do him Right, I'll criticize on what you've seem to-night. First thenâPoetick Justice to maintain, He needs must make a Monarch sigh in vain: Next, he has drawn his Dame so very, veryâgood, I'm much afraid she is not Flesh and Blood: His Lover too cools strangely on the Tryal; A Milk-sop, to be baulk'd for one Denial! Had he but push'd the Matter homeâyou'd find His haughty Mistress might have prov'd more kind. What would become then of Dramatic Rules? Ah Ladies! These same Poets are strange Fools! Suppose the King had brought th'Affair about, How should the Murtherâpray youâbe found out? No jealous Pangs fierce Leolin could move; There are no Tracks left in the Paths of Love. For many a Spark has by some Maid been bless'd, And much good Love gone onâwithout a Priest; Yet the succeeding Husband never found That any Trespasser had broke his Ground: For Marriage, Gentlemen, has binding Laws, And a kind Husband patches up all Flaws. But hang the Tragedy, be kind and spare A Minute's Audience in our own Affair. Thanks to your Favoursâsince we now can boast, That all our Pains to please you were not lost. Yon Rival Theatre, by Success made great, Plotting Destruction to our sinking State, Turn'd our own Arms upon us,âandâwoe be to us, They needs must raise the Devil to undo us! Strait our Enchanter gave his Spirits Wing, And conjur'd all the Town within this Ring. But, Ladies, be not frighted at our Devil; These merry Fiends are always wondrous Civil. And hark ye, Beaux; Know, all the Females you see here on Nights, Are Witches, and can conjure up strange Sprights; Yet be not scar'd, but set your Hearts at Ease, They've Power to lay the Devils which they raise.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Dead March. After which, Enter Gomel, Albert and Morvid. Gomel. It ceases now the solemn Harmony Of slow-pac'd Grief attending Caduan's Herse, Convey'd in funeral Pomp from Neustria's Shore. Alb. Thus then at length returns our exil'd King To take Possession of the British Earth. All was his Due; but oh! a scanty Portion, No more than what his meanest Vassals claim, The measure of his Clay, must now suffice him. Mor. Observe the Malice too of Caduan's Fate, To seize him just as his advent'rous Son, Our Royal Edwin, had surpriz'd and slain, In his own Palace here, usurping Elfrid. Gom. Say rather, Heaven's Indulgence interpos'd Between his helpless Age and Ills to come: 'Tis true, the Tyrant's gone, and Leolin (His Captive Offspring) holds his forfeit Life By Edwin's Grace; but Tudor, who e'erwhile Led Elfrid's conqu'ring Troops against the Picts, Returns in Triumph to redeem his Son. Alb. And shake our Monarch's Throne with rebel Arms. I know the Rumour. Gom. 'Twas at first no more; Darkly begun, and doubtfully receiv'd. But Scouts and Passengers confirm it now. The necessary Measures are concerted For Succour and Defence, our Forces muster'd, The Gates secur'd, and Malecontents disarm'd. For frighted Verulam expects a Siege, Soon as the next unwelcome Morn renews The now declining Day. Alb. Why, then 'tis War; And War in a distemper'd State like ours Lets out ill Blood; 'tis Exercise, 'tis Health. Mor. You speak but half it's Praise; why War, my Lord, Is of eternal Use to Human Kind; For ever and anon when you have pass'd A few dull Years in Peace and Propagation, The World is overstock'd with Fools, and wants A Pestilence at least, if not a Hero. Alb. And yet Extremes (might Albert's Wish prevail) Should be avoided: from my Soul I pity Your Pris'ner Leolin; why nam'd I Pity? His Fall from Empire well may challenge that; But here 'tis more: O'erpower'd in the late Action By Numbers, he resign'd his Sword to me; And from that Moment, (whence or how, I know not) A secret Simpathy has join'd our Hearts. Gom. Yet Duty bids you arm in Edwin's Cause, Your rightful Monarch. Alb. And Matilda's Brother. Mor. Ay, your Matilda's, if her Father's Choice, Illustrious Birth, and ever faithful Love, My Lord, your Uncle's Merits and your own, Can make her yours. She is but now arriv'd, The mournful Harbinger of Caduan's Dust: Ye cannot yet have met. Alb. My Morvid, no; And ere her Beauties glad my longing Eyes, My captive Friend, my Leolin, expects me: I go to find him now. [Exit Albert. Gom. To find the Man Whom, thoughtless as he is, he most should shun: The Curse of barren Honesty attend His Simpathy of Hearts; it suits but ill The secret Purpose of my working Brain: Anon I'll tell you more: withdraw a while; For see, our Sovereign, and Matilda with him. [Exit Morvid. Enter Edwin and Matilda. Edw. You Gomel oft have heard the strict Command Our Father gave me, ne'er to entertain A Thought of lost Dominion, while himself Or Elfrid liv'd. Gom. Most true, my honour'd Lord; I well remember his repeated Maxim; Who strikes at Sovereign Power, had need strike home; For Storms that fail to blow the Cedar down, May tear the Branches, but they fix the Root. Edw. And therefore when the Plan of Elfrid's Fall Was modell'd, I by stealth obey'd the Summons Of Friends, nay more, that best of Friends, Occasion, My Father's Leave unask'd. Gom. But sure the Hazard That chill'd his aged Blood, and check'd your daring, Must in proportion have enhanc'd the Value Of this Atchievement, had he liv'd to know it. Mat. Alas he knew it, for the News arriv'd Not many Minutes ere he breath'd his last. Edw. Those Minutes were worth Years: When I expire, Such Tidings wait the Moment of Despair, And chear my parting Soul. Mat. My dearest Brother! What have you said? avert this Omen, Heaven. The News you mention, far from giving Joy, But hasten'd and encreas'd his dying Pangs: He struck his Breast, and groan'd, âMy Son is lost: I ask'd him, How? and still, âMy Son is lost, Was eccho'd back. Edw. Amazement! lost? but why? Misfortune has its Doubts, and Age its Fears, (Or Foresight, which you will) and they explain His fix'd Aversion to the bold Attempt: But when the Powers that smile on injur'd Right, Had crown'd it with Success, then! then these Outcries! What can they mean? For they seem big with Meaning: But how to penetrateâto fathom itâ 'Tis midnight Darkness all: My Father knew, And had it pleas'd his Caution to unfold itâ He would notâno, he was too wise for That. Gom. And blind Obedience still impos'd on You. Edw. But there his Wisdom err'd; was Reason his? 'Twas mine no less; and Nature has bestow'd it For Use, not Slavery to a Parent's Will: I trod the Path it manifestly trac'd, And did my Duty to a groaning Nation, As Caduan should have done; but stay, should Caduan Have ruin'd Me? for, if I heard you right, His Son, he said, was lost. Mat. He did. Edw. O whence Those cruel Sounds, the language of Despair? Was it a Shock so fatal, if I serv'd him Against his Will, that it should hasten Death? And have I kill'd my Father? dreadful Thought! I shake, I sicken at the very mention: No wonder, Leolin resents so deeply, And will not be appeas'd for Elfrid's Blood. Mat. Spilt by your Hand. Edw. By my unwilling Hand. We met in Fight, and in his hoary Locks An Image of my Father's Age appear'd: I startled, paus'd; and pointing with my Sword To Heaps on Heaps that died in his Defence, Begg'd him to save the few remaining Lives Of his now vanquish'd Friends, but most his own: He answer'd in a Peal of mad Reproach, With Traytor, Monster, Coward and Ingrate Rung in my Ears; and as his feeble Rage Just reach'd my Buckler with a dying Blow, Full on my Weapon's Point he wildly ran His swelling Heart, and let out Life and Anguish. Mat. Such is the sudden Fall of impious Power: A fatal Lesson, could Ambition learn! Edw. It will not from my Mind this strange Behaviour Of dying Caduan: stay, I have a Thought Just dawning on my gloomy Doubts; the Medal He gave me, must disclose the Mistery. Mat. It bears (as I have heard) a dark Device, Which Caduan never would unriddle. Edw. Never So long as Elfrid liv'd; but still he own'd, The same Necessity that kept it secret 'Till that Usurper's Death, would then require To have it fully known. Mat. But Caduan too, He who should make it known, is now no more. Edw. In view of that Event, he chose a Friend, His sure Interpreter. Mat. What Friend, my Brother? Edw. He would not name him. Mat. But the time is come For Explanation; has my Lord inquir'd? Edw. I have, to my Surprise, in vain. Mat. Of whom? Edw. Of Gomel, Runo, Cador, Arnold, all Whom Caduan honour'd with the least degree Of Confidence or Love. Mat. Could you have added Revolting Tudor to that loyal List, I shou'd have fancied Him the Man distinguish'd By that important Trust; for when th'Account Of your Success with unexampled Horror Distracted Caduan in the Hour of Death; Ev'n in the Height of that Confusion, Tudor Employ'd his lab'ring Thought; he nam'd him thrice, And thrice essay'd to utter something more; But Sense was shatter'd by approaching Fate, Or vainly struggled on his fault'ring Tongue In undistinguish'd Sounds. Gom. But naming Him Affords some Light, for sure he would have said, That Rebel was in Arms, and might revenge The Tyrant's Death by yours Mat. If that was allâ Edw. Why, what could it be more? Mat. Nay, nothing more; At least that we can guess; whate'er it was, 'Tis Nothing now to Him, for he is Nothing. Edw. No, That could ne'er be All: we know too well That Tudor once was Caduan's Friend. Gom. A false one. Edw. He was, my Gomel; your true Friends are Jewels That sparkle in the Dark; but faithless He, The King's not Caduan's Friend, the Slave to Chance, Turn'd as she turn'd, and made his Peace with Elfrid. Mat. His Peace and Fortune too. Gom. He did, by Treason To injur'd Caduan, his forgotten Master. Mat. What, by deliberate, malicious Treason? Edw. Attend and judge: you are not now to learn That at the very time when Elfrid set The Standard of Invasion up, his Wife Honoria, banish'd from her Lord, and then A Guest at Caduan's Court, became a Mother Some Hours before the Queen, and died in Child-bed. Mat. Of Leolin. Gom. Your Adversary's Birth, Though under Influence of far different Stars, In Time and Place accompanied your own. Mat. As Elfrid's Son was then in Caduan's Power, Why quitted he that Pledge of kinder Terms From his victorious Rival? Gom. By Advice Of Him he trusted most, ungrateful Tudor. Edw. For there the Traytor play'd his wily Game, Abus'd his Credit with the King my Father, Conceal'd th'impending Danger, and delay'd His needful Flight, 'till unawares beset By hostile Troops, he found himself constrain'd To purchase his Escape of conqu'ring Elfrid, By rend'ring safe into his Hands, the Hopes Of lost Succession in his Infant Heir. Mat. This Caduan told you. Edw. No, he still was blind To Tudor's Fraud, and to the last excus'd His foul Revolt; but trusty Gomel here In special Confidence reveal'd it to me. Mat. Well, if my Father misinform'd you not (As sure he never would) the Hour is nigh To satisfie your Doubts. Edw. The Hour I wish, And fear at once; for when I urg'd the King To clear the Medal's mystic Sense, he fetch'd A Sigh, and added; âthe Discovery âYou press so warmly, will be made in time; âIt must, to vindicate my harsh Restraint â(For such it seems) in bar of your Designs âOn Elfrid's guilty Throne; but oh! remember, âThe Secret that unknown, excites your Wonder, âWhen known, will give you Pain; and task the Virtue âTo which I train'd you from your Infant Years, âTo bear it as you ought. Mat. Ah me! I tremble In apprehension of some dire Event. Gom. My gracious Princess, 'tis for Guilt to fear: But what has Edwin done? let Albion judge, Freed by his Arm. Edw. Alas we deal in Air Our random blows; Appearances indeed Pronounce me Innocent; but then my Heart, (I know not why) my boding Heart condemns me. Matilda, You have rais'd this stubborn Phantom; What Business has it here? it answers Nothing; But stares me in the Face, and will not stir: This is an Enemy I cannot kill Like Elfrid. So! I thank thee, Memory; For there's an Image too, that stings me home. Well, they are now no more, the Royal Rivals; And Elfrid's Fun'ral Dues, by my appointment, Have waited to be paid with those of Caduan. The British Island was too narrow once To hold them both; but ere To-morrow's Sun Forsakes the Skies, one reconciling Tomb Shall hide their cold Remains. Mat. I dedicate The mournful Space between, to Grief and Friendship, My Father and my Adeliza. Edw. Said you? O let me add, my Adeliza too. By Heav'n the Terrors, that till now have froze me, Relent and fly before so dear a Name; And Comfort smiles upon the healing Sound. Gom. You saw her lately, and but saw, recall'd From War and Triumph to our banish'd Court, As She was leaving it; She charm'd you then. Mat. But Time and Absenceâ Edw. Have enlarg'd the Wound. You drew the Picture of her matchless Mind; Her brave Adherence to our ruin'd Cause, Triumphant o'er the mercenary Views That would have brib'd her to espouse the Part Her Father Tudor took; you painted well; But 'twas superfluous then, for I had gaz'd, And through the chrystal Case descried the Gem. Mat. Has Love oblig'd you with a second View? Edw. Alas Matilda, no; the very Day When I arriv'd at Elfrid's Court, she left it On some unknown Disgust. Mat. But my Arrival Has brought her back to welcom Me; nor less (If I mistake not) to disclaim Rebellion, Though headed by the Man who gave her Life. I have your Leave to introduce her here. Edw. Yes, yes, my Sister, quick; fly Gomel, bring her To Edwin's harrass'd Soul, like cooling Streams [Exit Gomel. To the parch'd Lips of Thirst: for, Oh Matilda, My Cares already far out-weigh my Crown; But Adeliza yet might give me Ease. O set before my Eyes that heav'nly Form To smooth the Billows here, and hush the Storm; Then Halcyon Love, in angry Fate's despight, Shall spread his downy Wings, and hatch Delight. Re-enter Gomel with Adeliza; then Exit. Ade. Thus at your Feetâ Edw. 'Tis there I wish my Foes; And only there, that I may raise 'em thence. Ade. You see the Daughter of your greatest Foe. Edw. Recal that Sentence; Adeliza's Father Is Edwin's Friend: For those he leads against me, I have a Cause and Sword too lately tried To let me fear an after-game of Treason. Ade. But could you fancy that a Father's Name Had warp'd my Honour to a Moment's Pause Between the Ties of Kindred and Allegiance, The Blood that warms my Heart with loyal Rage, Would cover me with Blushes; and to clear My Duty from the slavish Imputation, Of counterfeit or cold in Tudor's Daughter, Would be to lay upon my gracious Lord A Blot he scorns, the meanness of Distrust. Edw. Nay, and the Folly too; for sure, the Fear To be deceiv'd, deceives a Monarch most: Nor can I listen to its Whispers now, Without Injustice to the many Virtues, That shining out in Adeliza's Form, So well repay her Lips, her Cheeks, her Eyes, The Charms they borrow thence. Ade. O Sir forbear. Mat. Accomplish'd thus, and Tudor's only Child, Well may she prove the Darling of his Age; And here with You remains a Pledge to charm The Sword of Treason from his Hand. Edw. You mean, The Sword of Justice and Defence from mine. Ade. My Lord, I apprehend you not. Edw. You will not: But tell me, rather than appear so cold, Tell me, you wanted Faith; for then at least You give my Tongue Occasion to renew The dear Confession: and a Heart like mine, Big with Desire, would surely break at last, Without a vent in Sighs and Repetition Of all that Love, the fondest Love can say. Ade. Sir, this Discourse agrees not with the Times: Think of securing an indanger'd Throne. Edw. O make it worth securing, and resolve To share it with me. Ade. 'Tis impossible. Edw. Say that no more, or in a milder Tone; And sink the grating Sense in gentle Sounds: I could rejoice to hear Impossible Softly pronounc'd, and swear it meant, I yield. What, not a Word? Matilda! Adeliza! Mat. Nay Adeliza, speak. Ade. My Silence speaks. I cannot speak to please my Royal Lord; And would not, to offend. Edw. Alas Matilda, Is this the promis'd Joy? 'tis own'd, my Love Has wanted hitherto the Proof of Sufferings, And constant Zeal in Adeliza's Service: I have, I have presum'd, O much too far On the Prerogative of Royalty, To think the Proffer of that Toy a Crown Sufficient here to manifest my Passion. But on this Handâ Ade. Which never can be yours. Edw. So stern! and so resolv'd! Why, this Denial Is more, far more than Form or Caution, owing To Virgin Modesty, or Faith untried: This is obdurate Hate, and fix'd Disdain. Now by the Blood that stain'd my conqu'ring Sword In Elfrid's wretched Fall, I swear his Death Is well reveng'd; by Adeliza too; By her to whom he fell a Sacrifice. Ade. A Sacrifice to me? Edw. To you alone. The public Call to right my self and Country I had before; but then I ne'er had seen Those all-subduing Eyes; and when I saw, My Virtue fir'd by Love of you, dispens'd Like heated Gums, its salutary Odours, And at one push redeem'd a Diadem, To lay it at the Feet that now have spurn'd it. Ade. Let not my Sovereign blemish the Renown Of saving Britain by a Cause so worthless. Edw. Be just to your Desert; and think, oh think No Cause so worthy as my Love to You; And then be just to Edwin, and reward it. Ade. I pity that which I so ill deserve, Your Love; but cannot, Sir, command my own. Edw. You cannot now command it; but allow me The small poor Hope that Time may prove my Friend. Ade. By curing your Disease. Edw. O never, never: I wish not to be cur'd; the last Distress Of Love so tender and so true as mine, Is Pride and Pleasure too. Ade. My Lord, I grieve To see you thus, and beg I may retire. Edw. Matilda, call her back; she hates not You: You are no Edwin. Mat. Adeliza, stay At my Entreaty, since you slight the King's. Edw. I thank you thus; nay now the turn is mine To kneel. Ade. I cannot bear this Posture, Sir; And mustâ Edw. O hold! you know the Way to raise me; Rather than drive you hence, I yield to rise: You shall prescribe my Posture, Distance, Words; All but my Looks; for I must gaze for ever. Mat. How is it with you, Sir? you started. Edw. Why, Instead of yonder Angel Face that fix'd My Eyes so long, just now methought, I saw The pale and bloody Form of murder'd Elfrid. Mat. Call it not Murder, Sir. Edw. Had I a right To kill him? Mat. Yes. Edw. Why, who am I? Mat. The King. Edw. But are you sure I am? then who is she? Mat. 'Tis Adeliza, Sir. Edw. My Sister's Friend? Mat. The same. Edw. Her Friend? and so unkind to me? Or do I dream? wake, wake me, if I do: Alas I wake too sure; my Dream is over; For Edwin's Dream was Hope. Ade. It was, my Lord; Butâ Edw. What? but never let it be again: That you would say: inexorable Maid To banish Hope! allow it but a Dream; Must weary Nature be deny'd to sleep, Or ev'n to slumber, lest our Dreams deceive us? Alas for helpless Man, when left to sink Beneath the Tyrant Weight of waking long To Truth and Reason! how I envy them Who purchase Happiness, at least Repose, In being cheated by the Vision, Hope! The Dreamer, disappointed of his Hope, Indeed is wretched; but most wretched He, Who still must love, and still despair like Me. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Gomel and Morvid. Gom. You seem in Haste; may I demand the Cause? Mor. The Castle is my Province, and requires Immediate Orders to sustain the Siege That threatens it from Tudor. Gom. You may stay, If that be all the Business. Mor. Why? Gom. That Tudor Directs his March to Verulam, is true; The rest a Fiction. Mor. How? Gom. His Declaration On Leolin's behalf, a false Alarm Of my Contrivance to amuse the King And Leolin at once; a Bait for both. Mor. But must not Time, a little Time disprove it? Gom. Admit it should; our yet unsettled State Accounts for panic Frights and groundless Rumours, Without their being trac'd and fix'd on me. You make your Court to Leolin? Mor. I do: He is my Charge as I command the Fort; But still I drop the Governour to Him, Approach him as a Friend, affect Compassion, And seem the Convert of his ruin'd Fortune. Gom. I like it well; it favours my Design. Guess you the Mark at which my Measures aim? Mor. Not I, my Lord. Gom. I'll tell you then. Mor. But can you? For I have been so us'd to Nods and Smiles, To that sage Brow and most important Shrug, That 'tis my Maxim; Mutes and Politicians Converse by Signs. Gom. Be serious and attend me. This false Report of War denounc'd by Tudor To rescue Leolin from Bonds, is rais'd By me to ruin him; the Method This: You are his seeming Friend, and soon may fire His sanguin Temper, and his haughty Soul, To such a Confidence in Tudor's Aid, As shall dispose him to reject the Terms That Edwin will on this Occasion offer'd: By my Advice: the Death of Leolin Follows of course, and instantly, to end Rebellion at a Blow. Mor. But why, my Lord? You Statesmen are so shrewd in forming Schemes! But often to secure some trivial Point, And answer ends as little wise as just! Such Children are ye, busy, nice and anxious, To raise a Bawble, Paper Edifice, That by its own slight Make betray'd to Ruin, Wants not a Breath of Air to puff it down! Gom. Your Meaning, Morvid? Mor. To discover yours. Why would you murder Leolin? the King Inclines to spare him. Gom. And advance him too: He has his secret Checks, his vile Misgivings, His Qualms for Elfrid's Death; and would extend The Hand that drew the Father's Blood, in Mercy And Favour to the Son. Mor. I understand you: A Match between the Captive and Matilda Is Edwin's Aim; and you would disappoint him In Albert's Favour. Gom. And my own: the Hour That yields the Princess to my Kinsman's Arms, Allies me to the Crown. Mor. Is that your Drift? Why then let Leolin be slain or spar'd, 'Tis all the same: renouncing proffer'd Grace, And menacing aloud, he now denies To wed Matilda. Gom. Still he has Ambition: And may not Opportunity awake it To claim the Crown? Mor. And balk the distant Chance Of its devolving on Matilda's Head, By Failure of Succession from the King. Gom. I grant it Chance, and distant in Appearance; But we may bring it near, and fix it sure. Rid me of Leolin; and then, my Morvid, The subtle Malice of a deadly Draught, Suborn'd by meâ Mor. May taint the Royal Cup, And make Matilda Queen. Gom. Conclude it done. Mor. But Albert whom you labour to secure, By Leolin's Destruction, is his Friend. Gom. I know it well, and therefore most unfit To share the Secret of his own Advancement: The Boy is young, and idly scribled o'er, Between the Nurse and Priest, with Bugbear Tales Of Apparitions, Hell and Honesty: But Time (I trust) good Counsel and Experience Will wear the slavish Characters away, And prove him of my Blood. Mor. But yet at present His Soul appears to have another Turn. Gom. And but appears perhaps; for there's my Comfort: Your good Appearances are necessary To countenance the Growth of Infant Power. The Cheat Ambition, eager to espouse Dominion, courts it with a lying Show, And shines in borrow'd Pomp to serve a turn: But the Match made, the Farce is at an end; And all the hireling Equipage of Virtues, Faith, Honour, Justice, Gratitude and Friendship Discharg'd at once. Mor. No more, my Lord: the Princess, And Adeliza. Gom. Well, you know your Work. If Edwin should require a Conference, Prepare the Captive for it; and exalt him By specious Hopes of promis'd Succours near, Beyond all Terms of Treaty. I depend Upon your Skill and Diligence. Mor. You may. What Morvid once begins, he will pursue: A half-strain'd Villain is a Coward too. [Exeunt. Enter Matilda and Adeliza. Mat. O Adeliza, dear disdainful Maid, You have been cruel to a suppliant King; Indeed you have, and to Matilda too. Ade. Call it unwilling Cruelty to both. If yielding to ascend the Royal Bed, That fatal Honour would undo my Peace; Can my Misfortune be Matilda's Joy? Mat. It cannot, Adeliza; but the Dearness That must unite our Bliss or Misery, Gives me a Privilege to ask the Reason Of all this deep Aversion. Ade. When Aversion Is rul'd by Reason, you shall have an Answer. Mat. I have it now in Adeliza's Face; You blush and turn away; be true to Friendship, And name the Man who triumphs in your Henrt O'er Edwin and a Crown. Ade. O rather tax me With Malice to the Sex, than dreaming Love, By far the worse Extreme. Mat. You will not answer. Has Edwin then no Rival? Ade. To confess A cruel Truth, he has; a Darling Rival, That lording in my Breast, without Controul, Excludes all Tenderness, unless for you. Mat. Well Adeliza, but this Rival's Name? Ade. Revenge, my best Matilda; dear Revenge! Mat. For what? Revenge is Heaven's. Ade. And Woman's too. For injur'd Love and violated Truth. Mat. O then at least there has been Love: proceed; Who is the faithless Man? and whence the Change? Ade. I must not tell you. Mat. How! not tell Matilda? Ade. Not her, to chuse. Mat. Then am I not your Friend? Ade. You are; butâ Mat. What? Ade. You areâit will not out: Shame and Resentment twice have stop'd my Tongue: But look another way, and I will tell you; You are my Rival too. Mat. O Heaven, in whom? Ade. In false, inconstant, perjur'd Leolin. Mat. Was he your Lover then? Ade. Provoking Word! Was he, Matilda? no, he never was; I fancied otherwise, and that deceiv'd me: For he who was my Lover Yesterday, Is so to-day, and will be so for ever. Mat. That I should wed with Leolin, and graff Our juster Title on the Tyrant Stock, Was Elfrid's fav'rite Scheme. Ade. And Leolin Consented. Mat. True; and that Consent destroy'd him. Ade. It did; for Edwin, summon'd on Pretence Of that intended Match, to Verulam, Atchiev'd his true Design, th'Usurper's Fall, Conspir'd by Friends whom his Arrival arm'd. Mat. But may not Leolin adore you still, Though once o'er-rul'd by Interest of State Into a Breach of Faith? there was no Knowledge, No Sight of me; and could be no Desire. Ade. That, that inflames the Guilt; for you have Charms To justifie the Change, at least excuse; But oh! to leave me for a Crown, Matilda! The Loss of which, and by those very Means That Policy projected to secure it, Is Justice scant and lame, while he continues To draw that Breath so treacherously lavish'd In unregarded Oaths to Adeliza. Mat. Is Death the Measure then of your Revenge? Ade. Death or a worse, could any thing be worse Than Death imbitter'd by that fear of dying, Which Nature ever plants in faithless Hearts. Mat. Would you inflict a greater Punishment? Return his Injury in Kind, and meet The King my Brother's Love. Ade. You startle me: Must I be tortur'd for another's Crime? That would be Vengeance on my self. Mat. It would, By crossing your Desires, that still are fix'd, In spight of all your Rage, on Leolin. Ade. The Traytor Leolin? Mat. Consult your Heart, The greater Traytor far, that harbours Love Beneath the show of Hate: were Passion o'er, It would appear by your Indifference; Not by your Spleen, your Violence, your Rage; For what are they but other Names for Love, For Love, my Adeliza, ill disguis'd? The Storm is rais'd, the Billows fly before it; But be not so deceiv'd, for all the while Affection has its Current underneath, And drives a different way with equal force. Ade. Your Observation, Madam, may deceive you, Though long experienc'd in the turns of Love, That springing in your early Years, grew with you, In kind requital of your Albert's Vows. Say, has my Princess seen her Lover yet? Mat. In Presence of the King; he told me there, That he had somewhat to communicate In private: Here he comes. Ade. Then I retire. Mat. But, Adeliza, not from Court: I long Have liv'd without you, and shall want you soon. [Exit Adeliza. Enter Albert. Alb. So when the feather'd Quire have fainted long Beneath the Dogstar's heat; if kindly Rains Revive them from above, they meet half way The Blessing, perch'd on some tall Poplar's height; Refresh their Plumes, and prune their drooping Wings, Drink the descending Shower, and sing its welcome. Mat. Do I behold my Fugitive again? Ah wandring Albert, you escap'd me once; But I have now o'ertook, and claim my Pris'ner. Alb. And when I cease to wear Matilda's Chains, May IâI would have wish'd a Punishment To match the Crime; but can imagin none; None but the Crime its self, 'Twas Tyrant Duty (My Princess knows too well) that forc'd me from her In Edwin's train to visit Verulam. Mat. But was you loth to leave me? did you wish To stay behind, or cast a longing Look On Neustria's Shore? did you accuse the Wind That bore your Vessel thence? or say when landed, When you had pass'd a Week of Absence here, Say did you long for your Matilda then? Matilda, if you did, discharg'd the Debt, Returning Sigh for Sigh, and Tear for Tear. Alb. Dear as my Soul, and kind to all its Wishes; Long for Matilda? does the Merchant long To reach his Haven, when the Billows mount And the Storm roars amid the groaning Shrowds? Mat. He does; but shelter'd there a while, forgets The danger past, and tempts the Seas again. Alb. No, by the cruel Pangs that wait on Absenceâ Mat. Was it so painful then to live without me? Alb. I call to witness all my leisure Hours, Spent in Retirement and the thought of You; And when the Court and Camp by turns amus'd me, 'Twas but a faint Relief to heighten Care: For oh the Torment when I went to Rest, And clos'd my Eyes in vain! When all at once A thousand anxious Thoughts that slept by Day, Swarm'd in my Brain, 'till it resembled Hell, Hot, dark and hot: my sick Imagination, Assisted by the Shades of Night, would give A gloomy turn to each Idea there: The prospect then of Joys to come, revers'd, Grew less and less, and doubtful and remote. Remembrance haunted me with past Endearments; But most, the Image of some happy Rival. At length when Nature, harrass'd to Repose, Forc'd on my half-shut Eyes a Minute's Slumber; The beatings of an aking Heart would wake me From some black Dream of Horror and Despair; 'Till Morning Sleep reliev'd my weary Soul; And Hope, the Daughter of the Dawn, return'd. Mat. But does that Hope allow no room for Fear? Or may you apprehend a Rival still? Alb. You mean the Captive Prince. Mat. My Brother means him. Alb. He will not, sure, compel your Hand. Mat. He should not: My Heart is yours. Alb. O grant me to adore Thus on my Knees Matilda's powerful Truth. Mat. It has not yet been tried; but may too soon; If Leolin, reduc'd to a Compliance, Leaves me th'invidious task to stand it out, And thwart the Measures of my Royal Brother. Alb. But Adeliza, reconcil'd by you To her offending Lover, would confirm him; And to intreat your Intercession there, Was his Request to me. Succeed in This, Oblige my Friend, and ease our mutual Fears. Mat. But I alas have other Fears: the King Loves Adeliza; and to-day, my Albert, Has press'd her stubborn Scorn with baffled Vows: Say will He pardon me? can slighted Love In its despairing Pangs forgive a Sister Her Friendship to a more prevailing Rival? Alb. Yet Madam, this Discovery but enforces What I have urg'd; for Edwin's Love may widen The Breach our common Interest would heal. Mat. On your Approach my Adeliza left me; Watch her Return, and introduce your Friend. [Exit Albert. Re-enter Adeliza. Ad. O Madam, Albert is retir'd in season; I was pursued, and fly for Refuge here. Mat. Pursued? Ade. By Leolin: we met andâha! Re-enter Albert with Leolin. Mat. My Lord, Misfortune never fails to find A Friend in Me; believe me yours: Affairs Of Moment call me hence; but Adeliza Will stay at my Request to entertain you. [Exeunt Albert and Matilda. Leo. If ever Prayers prevail on heavenly Minds, 'Tis chiefly when th'Offender, drinking deep From the full Cup of Bitterness, prefers them: He needs no Merit then; his Miseries Become his Intercessors; and the Heart, Pierc'd with a sharp Remorse for Guilt, disclaims The costly Poverty of Hecatombs, And offers the best Sacrifice, its Self. Ade. What would my Lord? go on. Leo. I need not name, For you but know too well the bold Offender; And with an Eye of Pity will regard The Fall of Leolin. Ade. The Fall indeed From Faith and Honour. Leo. 'Tis a fatal Truth; But soon the Chastisement o'ertook the Guilt; And let it be an Argument for Pardon Ev'n of the worst Offence in Elfrid's Heir, That Edwin's Captive asks it. Hitherto I own a Royal Sense of what I was; And brook but ill my new Acquaintance, Shame: Yet thus abandon'd as your Lover is, For he must quit that Name and Life together, Believe him when he swears, his ravish'd Greatness Appears a trifle, weigh'd with losing You. Ade. Mark him ye Powers, whom he so oft has mock'd With broken Vows of Faith, O mark the Traytor; He throws me from him, and then calls it Loss. Leo. Throw Adeliza from me! Give my Crime, Black as it is, a milder Name than that: Nor represent as Choice, the forc'd Consent Of Duty doubled in a Son and Subject. O had you known how often I refus'd To wed Matilda, and how home they press'd That over-bearing Plea of publick Weal! I stood the shock of Menace and Reproach; But then paternal Love and kind Persuasion Surpriz'd my Virtue to a Moment's yielding; For 'twas no more: divide one single Link From Time's perpetual Chain, and I am guiltless. Recanting instantly, I beg'd the King To render my unwilling Promise back; But 'twas too late. Ade. That Promise then was binding, In spight of Promises and Oaths to me. Leo. I own their sacred Force, and urg'd it then; But in a most unhappy Hour, the News Of my consenting to my Father's Choice Had reach'd my Adeliza's Ears, and drove her Far from the Voice of my repenting Love. Ade. Else you had chang'd again. Leo. I had, and beenâ Ade. False to your Father, and to me by turns. Nay, you may safely now renounce Matilda: The glorious Fruit of your deserting Me Is plac'd beyond your Reach. Leo. Admit a Power In Edwin to direct his Sister's Choice; And she may still be mine. Ade. Matilda yours! Has he propos'd her now? Leo. He has, in vain. Ade. You much surprise me. Leo. Let me then presume At least that it offends you not, to find A Proof of Leolin's suspected Love. O Adeliza, do I view the Dawn Of dear Forgiveness in your alter'd Looks! That kindling Blush! and those dejected Eyes! Raise them again in a relenting Moment; Big with Compassion let them shine upon me, And drop their angry Beams, and tell the Tale Your Tongue refuses: can they still deny me? O let me seize your Hand, at least, and warm it Thus with my Sighs: withdraw it not so soon: I would have kneel'd, and printed Kisses on it, With all the Vows of Penitence and Rapture. Ade. Forbear that Rapture: it creates Distrust. Yours is a sudden Torrent of Desire; The Stream is rapid, but withal impure; Rais'd in an instant by impetuous Showers, And then as quickly down. There is a time, Believe me, Leolin, in Love there is, When 'tis more Pain to lose than Joy to keep; And the Want chiefly makes the Value: Beauty, That transitory Flower, ev'n while it lasts, Palls on the roving Sense, when held too near, Or dwelling there too long: by fits it pleases; And smells at distance best: its Sweets, familiar By frequent Converse, soon grew dull and cloy'd you. And so they would again. Leo. You wrong those Eyes, To think Satiety can e'er attend The Love they kindled here. Be merciful While I have Breath to ask you: Hope and Fear Shock me like adverse Tides; I cannot bear them; And my Soul sinks apace. O pardon, pardon. Ade. Yes, I will pardon you, but ah! beware, Beware my Leolin; for once again My Fondness calls you mine. Leo. I thank you thus, [Kissing her Hand. And thus. Beware of what? my Life! my All! Ade. Of a Relapse. Leo. O hear me: if hereafter I wrong the Goodness that acquits me now, Loath me; despise me. Fortune I forgive thee: And thou art now my Sport, as I was thine: Frown as thou wilt, since Adeliza smiles; And with a Look a Scepter's Loss beguiles: Subdu'd by Charms, that all, who view, adore, Her Goodness only could enflame me more. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter Edwin and Leolin. Leo. Forbid him? yes, when I have Power I will: But Edwin knows the Throne is Empire's Seat, The Throne of Elfrid; place me there, and Tudor Will yield Obedience to his King's Commands: Sent in your Captive's Name, they would not pass For his, but yours; the void Effect of Force. Edw. O what a Sophister is Pride! but hear me: Rebellion, bold in your pretended Right, Advances to beleaguer Verulam: Renounce it, or your Head, my Mercy's Gift (For that alone has hitherto preserv'd it) Shall answer your Contempt. Leo. Reserve your Threats For Slaves, for abject Slaves, for them whose Fears Make you their Master: know that Leolin Dares meet his Death, when Edwin dares pronounce it. Edw. O glorious Frenzy! what should awe my Justice? Are you defended by your Father's Guards? Leo. No, by a surer Guard, my Father's Wrongs. Edw. That Image damps my Rage. [Aside. Say, Leolin, Suppose I laid the Conqueror aside, Nay and the Monarch, to put on the Friend. Leo. The Friend would set me free to execute My Vengeance vow'd on Elfrid's Murderer. Edw. Urge not your Fall by these ungovern'd Starts: Unwillingly indeed I slew your Father, But not unjustly. Leo. Not unjustly, said you? Had Elfrid's Coarse been here, those Words had open'd His Wounds afresh, to let the Remnant out Of that dear Blood, which, shed by base Surprise, Defil'd our Houshold Gods, in Violation Of sacred Trust and hospitable Laws. Edw. Those Laws your Father violated first, Designing on my Liberty or Life, Beneath a specious Veil and false Pretence Of friendly Invitation to his Court, And lasting Union of our jarring Lines. Leo. Beneath a false Pretence! by all my Hopes Of Vengeance, his Destruction was not more Your Aim and Wish, than was that Union, His. Edw. I grant it; for your Marriage with Matilda Had plac'd a Pledge within his Power, to save him From the Pursuit of Justice, if I scap'd The Snare his Malice spread to catch my Life. Leo. The Snare to catch your Life! the Dream of Fear, Or Fiction of Ingratitude and Falshood. Edw. Say; was it not propos'd? Leo. But not resolv'd. Edw. It was. Leo. What hinder'd the Performance then? Edw. Matilda's Absence: your destroying me Had been lame Work, without securing her; Unskilful Mischief. Leo. Could you apprehend That Consequence if I espous'd Matilda, And yet embrace the Proffer? Edw. To promote The better my Design against your Father, So fairly justify'd by His on Me. Leo. By His on You; for so your Fears inform'd you; And 'tis but Natural for conscious Guilt Still to suspect the Treachery abroad, It always finds a home. Ed. Proceed; and since Your Province is to clear his Fame, deny His Usurpation of my Father's Crown. Be warn'd by his Example: Tudor influenc'd By you to sheath his Sword, my Title own'd, And past Offence forgot; I place you next me, The Kinsman of my Throne: if not, you dye: Death or Matilda: name your Choice, and now. Leo. Death or my Crown. Edw. Presumptuous Madman! yours? Can I endure this Arrogance? Leo. You cannot, With greater of your own: the Snarler Pride, Plac'd by a Mirror, Starts, and Barks and Bites At its own Image there. Edw. It does; and breaks The Glass: I'll make the Parallel compleat. A Guard there. Seize, disarm, confine him close. Leo. Do; swell thy bloody score; and wing Revenge Due to my Father's Ghost from Tudor's Sword: Disarm Him too, or Tyrant thou dost nothing. [Exit Leolin guarded. Enter Gomel. Edw. Gomel, the Captive here has brav'd my Power, And rail'd his better Genius from his side: Mercy its self, rejected with disdain, Points to the vengeful Ax. Gom. 'Tis self-Defence; Your only human means to tame Rebellion, And kill it at the Root. Edw. Be witness Heaven, I thirsted not for Blood, and would have spar'd him. The Rules of Dastard Policy indeed Require his Head; but I would chuse his Heart, The Conquest of Benevolence and Grace; And add one Jewel to a Crown restor'd. Let Usurpation, that Eternal Slave To Fear, the Tyrant's greater Tyrant, dy Her thirsty Purple deep in native Blood; The lawful Prince, by daring to forgive, Asserts the great Prerogative of Heaven, And proves his Claim Divine. Gom. Is that your Maxim? [Aside. Then if the Wind sits there, though still I steer A steady Course, 'tis time to shift my Sails. Compassion and Remorse, Your Biass, Sir, [to him. Were always mine: Necessity is still An odious Plea for Blood, though sometimes just: And fain I would avoid it. Edw. But the Means? Gom. Means are at hand, not absolutely sure, But promising enough to lead your Hopes Of trying Leolin with more Success Than you have lately found. Could you engage Fair Adelizaâ Edw. How? Gom. Would She consent To undertake him, on my Life he yields To Her Command, what he denied to yours. Edw. Why? why to hers? Gom. He never can dispute Obedience where he loves and is belov'd. Edw. Belov'd by Adeliza? Gom. And just pardon'd For Slights resented long, but now forgot In reconciling Vows of Love renew'd. Edw. Perdition! Gom. So, it works. [Aside. Edw. I will not bear it: I cannot. Gom. What, my Royal Lord? Edw. Hence, Traytor: Begone and execute him strait; nay rack him: Tormentor, 'tis thy Office. Have I found The Way at last to Adeliza's Heart? I have; and it shall bleed like Edwin's Oh! The lovely, dear, enchantingâSorceress. Enter Matilda and Adeliza. Ade. No more: behold the King. I leave you here: You will be better heard, if I withdraw. Edw. Stay, Adeliza: you may safely stay: Love shall be wav'd. I know it grates your Ears; From me, I mean. You start. Mat. O Royal Sir, The News of Leolin, dismiss'd but now With Anger, and adjudg'd to close Confinementâ Edw. Must please my Sister sure: I would have rais'd him To dear Matilda's Bed; he spurn'd the Honour; And Albert now is yours. Mat. Your Words have blest me: And Modesty forbids not the Confession, Join'd with my Heart's true Thanks. But what becomes Of Leolin? Edw. The present Exigence Resolves your Question: necessary Justice Demands his Life: our British Earth abhors His lawless Claim, and drinks his Blood to-night. Would you reverse his Doom? or To Gomel, You? or to Adeliza. You. She weeps! the loyal Adeliza weeps! But there are other Drops, though not so precious, To answer me for these. Why this is Treason: I'll look once more: O Treason, Gomel! Treason! Mat. Heaven guard the King. Edw. The King! nay, 'tis my Title: You Madam and your Father may dispute it: [To Adeliza. But I have Proof: to be supremely wretched Is to be King indeed. O give me room! To Arms! no longer shall these Walls confine me; These Limbs; this Flesh. Rebellion thou art welcome: I'll bare my Breast to Tudor's Sword; and Elfrid, All pale and screaming from behind, shall urge His Arm to plunge it deep within my Heart; Deep, Adeliza, as your Image there. Yes Madam, I will dye; and when I'm deadâ But Leolin dies first. Dispatch the Warrant [To Gomel. For Execution, and attend me with it. Ade. For Execution! hold; I beg you, hold One Moment. Edw. Hence; and see your King's Commands Perform'd. [Exit Gomel. Ade. O Sir, if you have Pity, spare him: Thus suppliant at your Feet bath'd in my Tears, [Kneeling. I own your Justice; but in Pity spare him. Edw. Spare him! Damnation! whom? you cannot meanâ Ade. I mean my Leolin. Edw. Heav'n! She avows it! Yours, Murd'ress? Ade. Mine: his Life or Death are mine. Edw. Absolute Woman! off: Oh, could I tear her Thus from my Heart! but there she cleaves too close. Mat. Can you own that; and see her thus, unmov'd: Edw. By all the Magic of afflicted Beauty, [Raising her. I never can. O Adeliza, cruel In your Disdain, more cruel in your Love! Ade. Say rather, cruel Fate that governs both. Edw. Have you refus'd me for a Rival Foe? And can you beg the Bane of all my Hopes, His hated Life? is Mercy yours to ask, But not to grant? Ade. And for that Cause, my Lord, I blush to ask. Edw. Why thenâ Ade. O hear me out: I blush to ask; I bleed if you deny. Edw. To make my Rival happy? 'tis too much: If Leolin must live, he lives for you. Ade. Our mutual Love, and plighted Faith require it. Mat. For Prepossession, and not Hatred, barr'd My Adeliza's Ears to Edwin's Vows. Edw. In Favour of my Foe. Mat. But not as such: She loves his Person, but detests his Cause. Ade. For Justice held the Scales; and Leolin, Dear as he is, was found too light to poize My Sovereign's Claim in Adeliza's Heart. Mat. O great Example of prevailing Honour! Led by so fair a Guide, let Edwin too Curb his Desire, and cease pursuing her Whom sacred Vows have made Another's Right. Edw. Another's Right, this Hour; the next shall end him; And Adeliza disengag'd by Death, Her Lover's Deathâ Mat. May wed his Murderer. Edw. How Murderer! when she, ev'n she allows Justice requires his Blood? Mat. I grant it does; If not already satisfied with Elfrid's. Edw. Why nam'd you Elfrid? pass that Image by: He forc'd his Fate from these forbearing Hands; And so does Leolin: Necessity Says he must dye. Ade. But when, my Lord? Edw. To-day: This very Hour. Ade. If soâ Edw. Or must I wait Till Tudor's Standard, in his Name advanc'd, Ascends my Palace Wall? why let them go (Since Adeliza's Happiness requires it) My Crown; my Life: for what are both without her? Ade. O hear me Sir, for I abhor the Thought. Edw. Yes, I have found your Drift: you would gain Time: Delay, the last Resource for Leolin, Saves Him and ruins Me. Re-enter Gomel. Ade. If I have Power To work on Leolin, it saves ye both. Suppose him mov'd by Adeliza's Prayers To quit his Claim, renounce my Father's Arms, Implore your Mercy, and retire with me To distant Claims a voluntary Exile? Edw. Retire with You? O Torture! Ade. To remove Th'unlucky Object of despairing Passion; A transient Torture, but a lasting Ease. Mat. And yet more lasting Fame. Ade. A Fame indeed: The Fame of saving where you might destroy; Of Reason temp'ring Love; and Mercy, Power. Mat. Of Empire unconfin'd by Space, and stretch'd O'er human Hearts; the triumph of the Mind. Ade. To these more powerful Motives add the Tribute Of Adeliza's Gratitude and Praise. Mat. And more than all, the secret Joy of Virtue Embrac'd for Virtue's sake. Ade. The God-like Pride Of heaping Blessings where you hope for none; And doing generous Right without a Bribe. Edw. O Force of Truth from Adeliza's Lips! Why must they charm me thus, and thus alone? I yieldâthey heard me not; I may revokeâ Mat. What said the King? Edw. No matter, what; I would Unsay it. Gom. Sir, your Orders are obey'd: Behold this Instrument. Edw. Deliver it To Adeliza. You are Mistress there [Exit Gomel. Of Life or Death to Leolin: I claim That Paper from your Hands, if he rejects The Terms demanded in his Name by You: If he complies, he has his Life; andâOh! I cannot speak the restâthe Thought is Hellâ How my Brain glows! now Reason keep thy Seat. I cool againâno Thanks; but haste away, E're I recal my Grant. Ay, haste, run, fly; [Exeunt Matilda and Adeliza. For 'tis to Leolin; Despair! and Death! And Furies! 'tis to Leolin from me. [Exit. Re-enter Gomel with Morvid. Gom. Whence came you to find out his Love? Mor. I met him Just leaving Adeliza; and the Joy Of Reconcilement forc'd the Secret from him, Unask'd by me. Gom. That Secret rightly tim'd (As I imagin'd) for his Rival's Ear, Has took a foolish Turn, and ruin'd all; Unless my last Reserve, your Genius, aids me To place the Grant of Adeliza's Suit In so perverse a Light, as may inflame Her Lover's Jealousy. Mor. At your Request He moves this Way: leave me, my Lord, to work him. [Exit Gomel. Enter Leolin guarded. Leo. Death has surrounded me; the Siege advances; And the decisive Breach will soon be made; Perhaps this Hour: but be it when it will, My dauntless Soul shall march superior out, And yield her Ruins up on Terms of Honour. My Friend! [Seeing Morvid. Mor. My King! for so my Wishes stil'd you. Leo. But Fate has order'd otherwise. Mor. It has; Fate and your self. Leo. I understand you not: Are Life and Death at Leolin's Command? Mor. Why nam'd you Death? Leo. Why not? the Bugbear, Death: Well may I name the Thing I cannot fear. Mor. You cannot fear it now, since Life is granted To your Request. Leo. To mine? Mor. 'Tis so believ'd: She could not warrant your Consent unask'd To such degrading Terms, as begging Life, Inglorious, private Life, in Banishment. Leo. Degrading Terms indeed. She warrant! who? Mor. Your Adeliza: nay, I know her Power O'er You and Edwin both. Leo. Her Power o'er Edwin? Mor. Why, she has told you: has she not? Leo. No, never. Mor. A kind Concealment! to have nam'd his Love, Had been to raise a Jealousie in You, Perhaps without a Cause. Leo. Damn'd, damn'd Perhaps! Confusion! you have rais'd it now indeed. Mor. Why, is it more than a Perhaps in Woman, For Love to carry it from Interest? A Sovereign Interest? Leo. Accursed Truth! And has she undertaken to perswade me To those Conditions? what if I refuse? She knows I will. Mor. If you refuseâbut how Should she know that? 'twere Cruelty indeed To offer Terms she knows you will refuse, And poorly trifle with your dying Hours. Leo. Proceed: what follows the Denial? Mor. Death, Your Due by Adeliza's own Confession. Leo. And worse than Death, her Marriage with my Foe. Mor. Nay, wrong her not, my Lord; she promis'd nothing: But owning Faith engag'd to you, declar'd She ne'er would listen to another Love, While you had Breath. Leo. O Hell! while I have Breath! For one long Hour she will not bless my Rival: But thenâthat Then is insupportable. Now, now I miss my Sword; but there are Walls, And Dungeon Bars. Mor. Nay Sir, compose your self: For Adeliza comes. I take my Leave. [Ex. Morvid. Enter Adeliza. Ade. O Leolin! the Pangs that tore but now Your Adeliza's Breast! I could not thus Have trembled for my self; for still I tremble, Ev'n though the Tempest is o'erblown; and Death, Once ready to devour my Love, must wait (For so my Fondness bodes) a Length of Years. Leo. I thank your Father, at the Head of Thousands Prepar'd to vindicate their Monarch's Cause. The Hawk, though eager of his Quarry, quits it; And panting, close within his Covert, cowrs; When the superior Eagle mounts aloft, Asserting the Dominion of the Sky. Ade. Is Edwin then, my Lord, no better known, That you can argue thus? Leo. To me he is not. No Madam, 'tis for you to know him better. Ade. What says my Leolin? Leo. He says, he swears That Adeliza is as kind as true. Ade. You will have Reason to allow me both; When told that Death, your late impending Doom, Is respited at my Request. Leo. At yours? Have you an Interest at Court? Ade. A greater Than I deserve. Leo. I cannot think it. Ade. What? Leo. That Adeliza's Interest in Edwin Outweighs her Merit. Ade. What it is, it serv'd My Zeal for you. Leo. Your Zeal to save my Life On honourable Terms. Ade. I think them such; And so will you, if Reason may be heard. Leo. O Adeliza, have a care of Reason: 'Tis an unwieldy Weapon, double edg'd, To wound the Female Hand that rashly draws, Or plays too freely with it. Ade. Well, my Lord; You silence Reason; but let Love prevail, And guide our Steps to unfrequented Scenes Of rural Freedom, Innocence, and Ease: Your Passions, hush'd on Adeliza's Bosom, Ambition, Hate, Revenge shall die away; And these fond folding Arms bound all your Wishes: In Peace we'll pass the Day, in Love the Night, Safe from the Storms that rock the World around us; And dwelling with the Villager, Content, Laugh at the gilded Thorns that plant a Crown. Leo. Is this the tow'ring Adeliza's sure She speaks in Sport, and cannot condescend To lose her Part on so obscure a Stage. Ade. And where besides, oh where can you expect To meet with true Repose? Leo. In endless Sleep; The sleep of Death: in Life 'twere fond to seek it. Give me pursuit and bus'ness; keep my Mind Awake with Expectation, or Enjoyment Of real Pleasure, and of active Good; If you would make me blest. I'll ne'er be buried Alive in your imagin'd Indolence; Your gloomy Sloth mistaken for Repose. The working Soul, unexercis'd abroad, Like martial Nations, turns its numerous Powers Upon its self; and sunk by native Weight, Begins intestine Broils, and War at Home. Ade. Ah Leolin! the Fever of Ambition Hangs on you still. Leo. And that of Vengeanee more. Ade. Suppose your Quarrel just, I grant it specious; Still you are in his Power, and must forgive. Leo. Must, Adeliza! were I so inclin'd, That grating Must would whet my Rage anew: No, Madam; the Necessity to pardon, I ne'er can pardon That. Ade. And will you die? Will you, my Leolin? oh most unkind, That I should try in vain to smooth your Soul, And win you to accept of Life and Me! Leo. On such Conditions too. Ade. You know them then. Leo. I know they must be noble, since obtain'd By Edwin's Fav'rite, Adeliza. Ade. How? Leo. You boasted of his Grace; pronounc'd it more Than you deserv'd; and could not fail to push it In my Behalf: and then for him, my Foe; Goodness and he are one. Ade. And so they are. Leo. Nay Adeliza, you espous'd his Cause From the beginning; and still blacken'd mine; Ev'n when it had an Advocate; a tried one; Your Sex's Idol, Power. Ade. Rash Leolin! Leo. False Adeliza! come, I know the Terms: And as you could not dream that I should e'er Digest such rank Disgrace; I take aright Your savage Insult on my lowly State; That insolent Pretence for breach of Faith, The Faith from which I freely now release you. Ade. Where will you drive? Astonishment! O stop. Leo. You shall not linger, 'till the fatal Stroke (If he dares strike it) makes th'Engagement void. Go, tell this Moment your new Lover, Edwin, (For know, the Secret you conceal'd with Care, Is now disclos'd) he has a fairer Claim To You than to the Crown: I will dispute To my last Breath, that purchase of His Treach'ry; But freely quit what he derives from Yours, Your Hand, your Heart. Ade. Is this my Recompence? The promis'd Fruit of supplicating Love? And have its Throes, its Pangs, its Travail serv'd To bring the Monster forth, Ingratitude, And raise a Blush on Adeliza's Cheek? O Heaven, my rebel Tears! they swell, they flow: This is Disgrace indeed. But thus I wipe The Woman from my Eyes; and in that Sigh The DÃ¦mon Leolin was dispossess'd. Exit Leolin. Go Wretch for ever lost, but not alone! The Curse is common, though the Crime his own; The cruel Crime that cancels his Reprieve, Condemning him to dye, and me to live. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter Albert and Morvid. Alb. O Morvid! Heaven direct to Albion's Good The more than common Fate it has denounc'd Upon the Faith of Prodigies. Mor. 'Twas wondrous, The Storm that all at once alarm'd the Court At dead of Night: The Casements open'd round; And by the Light of visionary Lamps, Two solemn Fun'rals first, and then a third In slow Procession cross'd the Palace-yard To yonder Temple: There the first arriv'd Appear'd to halt; 'till join'd by that which follow'd, They enter'd, all the three, the Vault beneath, Sacred to Royal Dust. Alb. I left ev'n now The Hall where Elfrid's Reliques wait Interment, Close by our Master's new erected Statue: From its extended Hand the Figure drop'd Its marble Sceptre on the trembling Bier, And set us all aghast. Mor. The King! and musing! But leave him to his Thoughts. Alb. I wait to pay My Duty to him on a dear Occasion. Mor. Matilda! Joy, my Lord; Joy ever new And fair Increase attend your promis'd Nuptials. Enter Edwin. Edw. Nay Albert, no Acknowledgments; for sure Albert kneels. Love, constant Love deserves Reward at last; And yours obtains it: mineâmay curse me yet A few hours more; and then the Crown descends To your Matilda. Alb. Cease, my Royal Master, These black, misgiving, melancholy Thoughts. Edw. How can I? O my Dream last Night! I lost it, A while in Love and Adeliza: now It haunts my Memory afresh. Alb. Your Dream! Edw. The Sun, methought, as now, with evening Beams Play'd on our Verulam's aspiring Towers, With Ease discover'd to my distant View, As longing on the Neustrian Shore I stood To cross the rowling Waves; that smooth'd at once, Invited my advent'rous Feet to try The wat'ry Way: I bounded lightly o'er, With Shouts attended, and a numerous Train; And gain'd the British Strand: but sudden there A rising Fog o'ercast the Face of Day: I lost my Prospect quite; and labour'd back To turn my Steps; but Motion fail'd my Feet, And Speech my Tongue, as fain I would have call'd Upon my following Friends, who now had left me Bewilder'd and alone. To shun the Tide, That roar'd and flow'd apace, I strove to climb A neighb'ring Cliff, whose chalky Rise, discolour'd With human Gore, betray'd my Footing; down I slip'd; and struggled, but in vain, to rise; For Elfrid held me to the Ground, and shriek'd Revenge and Murder in my Ears, so loud, That starting I awak'd. Alb. 'Twas full of Terror; And yet in spight of Signs and boding Dreams, There is one Omen still, the best of Omens, Auspicious, Sir, to You. Edw. What Omen Albert? Alb. Your Country's Cause that stands or falls with yours. Enter Adeliza. Edw. May I believe my Eyes? are You return'd To bless them once again? Adel. Just once again, To take my last Adieu. Edw. My fears foretold it: [Aside. She has prevail'd, and Leolin will go To blissful Banishment with Her he loves. But is my Rival then in haste to leave us? [To her. Adel. He is; in wondrous haste: had I been heard, He should have stay'd; for now he goes alone; But I shall follow soon. Edw. And must you follow? Adel. Would I had gone before. [Weeps. Edw. Oh Heaven! in Tears! Gone whither? let me understand you right. You carried Overtures to Leolin; But how they were receiv'dâ Adel. Let This inform you. [Giving a Paper. Why tremble thus my Hands? take, take them back, These bloody Characters; this Paper blotted, Like Adeliza's Heart, with Leolin. Edw. Has he refus'd? Adel. I need not, cannot answer. Enter Gomel. Gom. Rejoice my Royal Lord; the false Alarm (For such it proves) of Tudor's hostile March Is vanish'd; and the Messengers of Peace And Homage, just arriv'd, report they left him Some few Leagues hence, attended by a Guard Of chosen Horse: this Hour expect him here, Returning on the Wings of loyal Zeal. Edw. Blest unexpected Change! Alb. This shakes the Credit Of your Portents, my Lord, and ghastly Dreams. Mor. It proves them what they are, Illusion All; The Sport of Nature, and the Fumes of Blood. Gom. Suspend your Triumph till you know th'Event; [Aside to Morvid. For there are Hints, my Friend, in Tudor's Name, Of a surprising Scene that soon will open. Edw. Well Adeliza, this imports the Doom [Shewing the Paper. Of instant Death to haughty Leolin. Alb. Yet, e'er the Sentence be confirm'd, indulge me A Moment's hearing, Sir; for Sacred Friendship Pleads for my Leolin, and fain would save him. Edw. Save him! impossible. Alb. At least defer The Vengeance you resolve; nor let the Day, For ever blest, that makes Matilda mine, Blush in the Blood of my abandon'd Friend. Edw. Then be his Death delay'd; the News of Tudor Returning to Allegiance, makes Dispatch No longer needful; and his Crime requires The Pomp of publick Punishment, which I Ordain to Morrow; but let Morvid strait Conduct him fetter'd to the western Tower [Exit Morvid. Gom. Your Father's Courier, Madam, has Dispatches For You, and waits without. Edw. Yet, e'er you leave me, Speak, Adeliza, is all well? Adel. No doubt, All wondrous well. Edw. And you disclaim your Lover On full Conviction that his Doom is just? Adel. I own it just; but be not just by halves: Condemn me too, if you would quite destroy him; He dies not All, while Adeliza lives. Edw. What cruel Words were those! Adel. You forc'd them from me. When Judgment was pronounc'd, did I arrest it? What if my Eyes o'erflow'd? I curb'd my Tongue. Why urg'd you my Consent? oh! 'twas too much; Must I be vouch'd for Leolin's Destruction? Allow him faithless, cruel, and ingrate; To Morrow soon will come, and cancel all; Curse on the Day, when from his headless Trunk The Blood shall flow as fast as now the Tears From these fond Eyes hereafter doom'd to close In vain, while Fancy hags my lab'ring Dreams With Leolin; with Blood and Leolin. Alb. Have Comfort, Madam; Fate may find a Way To heal your Sorrows yet. Adel. They shall be heal'd: There is one Way; and Misery will find it. Edw. Would Adeliza die? Adel. Who would not die? Edw. You mean, for Leolin. Adel. I mean, alas! I know not what: I mean Despair and Shame, Disdain, Revenge, and Love; all, all together. [Exit Adeliza. Edw. And for my Rival All. Ye Powers, that doom'd me To hear these killing sounds and live, release My Father's Ghost to hollow in my Ears (For they are now prepar'd) the Crime unknown, The dire unheard of Tale of monstrous Guilt, For which I suffer thus. [Exit Edwin. Re-enter Morvid with Leolin guarded. Leol. My Albert here! The Friend of my Distress! A long Adieu. [They embrace. Alb. In Tears, my Leolin! Leol. But not for Death. Oh! need I tell you? not for Death, my Albert: These are the Drops of Friendship wrong'd; I give them To Trust betray'd by false deserting Tudor. Nay, now they flow for Adeliza too. Alb. And well they may, my Lord. Leol. She brought Conditionsâ Alb. Disdain'd by You, but kindly meant by Her. What rais'd your Passion to so wild a Height? Leol. 'Tis granted that I kept my Temper ill: But oh! the Smart of Empire lost, inflam'd By jealous Loveâ Alb. And why that jealous Love, Injurious to your Adeliza's Truth? Leol. Can she be true? Alb. Can Leolin suspect it? Oh, had you seen her here all pale and trembling, When forc'd by Promise to resign your Life, She utter'd such Distress to Edwin's Face, As must for ever blast his Rival Hopes! Leol. What have I done? the general Wreck had spar'd me One precious Gem; and has my wanton Rage Thrown That away, and trod it in the Dust? Where is she? where? Alb. This way she must return, To visit my Matilda, who expects her. Leol. She comes! the Charmer comes! as you have Power [to Morvid O'er these; employ it for a short Delay. [Exeunt Albert, Morvid, &amp;c. Fate must attend a while; I have not Leisure To welcome Death, till reconcil'd to Her. Enter Adeliza. Oh Adeliza! Adel. Speak my Lord. Leol. I will. But let me first subdue thisâI am choak'd With inly rising Bitterness, and pant Beneath a Load of Shame. Adel. What would you, Sir? Leol. O'ertake the Wings of Time, and snatch from thence The cruel Weight of one past guilty Hour. Adel. Your wish is vain: look forward, Prince. Leol. I must, To Death, and to its Sting, the Loss of You. Adel. Of faithless Adeliza? Leol. Ah! forbear; Forbear Reproach: My wounded Soul requires The Voice of Comfort; and that healing Voice Is yours or none. Adel. But are you now to learn The Business of your Life, the Skill to die Sedate and willing? Leol. 'Tis too sure, I am. Teach me the Way. Adel. I will, the only Way. Reflection your Renown, clear as your Conscience; The stormy Passions of your Soul, allay'd By Reason to soft Gales, serenely playing On the full Current of your youthful Blood, By Nature and Occasion smoothly led Through a fair Field of Royal Virtues, fruitful In great Examples, and in solid Joy, Unblemish'd Fame, and universal Blessings. Leol. Relentless Maid! Adel. Forbear. Remember too The humbler Praise of private Life, sustain'd In all its parts of Kindred, Friendship, Love; But have You ever Lov'd? Leol. Have You, who ask That killing Question? Adel. If you have; and found Your Passion answer'd by some easy She, Whose unexperienc'd Innocence could trust A smiling Ocean, infamously known For thousand daily Wrecks, the Faith of Man; Of suppliant, swearing, dying, perjur'd Man; If such an one there was; to crown your Peace, And make your last cold Pillow soft, remember Your Love, your Truth, your Gratitude to Her. Leol. On, Adeliza: more Reproaches, more; For oh! I feel them here: my vital Spirits Shrink at the chilling Sounds: And if my Heart, My heavy throbbing Heart presages true, Your Anger will perform to Morrow's work; And spare the milder Ax, or make it Mercy. Adel. Farewel. Leol. Oh! tarry. Said you not, Farewel? Adel. I did. Leol. Has This the Face of a Farewel, When Leolin and Adeliza part, And part to meet no more? Adel. To meet no more! Then have we met? inform me, where, or why. But let me look again. A Form like yours, My Fancy, working in the deepest Sleep That ever lock'd my Senses, figur'd to me, And nam'd him Leolin: methought, he talk'd Of Love for me; and charm'd me to Belief For Days, and Months, and Years: at length a Din Of sensless Jealousy and base Reproach, Betray'd the froward Wane of weary Truth In my imaginary Lover's Soul: Wak'd with the Clamour not an Hour ago, I found it all a Dream, a Phantom, Nothing: And yet (I blush to own so strange a Weakness) My Heart a while obey'd the strong Delusion, Though Sense return'd; and ak'd some Minutes after? Leol. Delightful Torturer! but spare me here: Call you my Love a Dream? behold the Dews Of waking Anguish thick upon my Brow: Is it a Dream, when at each Word you utter In Scorn or Hate, my feav'rish Pulse beats high, And all is War and Waste within my Bosom? When I breath short in Agony of Grief, And shake these Chains with Trembling? Adel. Ha! these Chains! Why? why these Chains? For I can hold no longer: Was it your Love for Me that grac'd you thus? Or chose you not, twice perjur'd Leolin, These softer Chains, when mine were shaken off? Leol. O say not so: I wear, I drag them still; They bend my haughty Spirit to Submission, Low as my Knee to Earth: I own my Crime; A Crime indeed that Adeliza's Goodness Could not prevent, and cannot now forgive. What shall I say? Shall I impute my Rage, One frantick Moment's Rage to Jealousy? But Jealousy is Love; and Love, Excuse; And I can ne'er excuse what You condemn. Yet Adeliza, yet would you receive, In a Repentance, visibly sincere, The Promise only of a Convert in me; (Since Death, my near inevitable Doom, Must cut the Fruit of all Amendment short) Would you do This, you would afford a Prince, Bred to the Hopes and Appetites of Greatness, The only Mercy he can ask, or want. Adel. Ha! I shall melt. Now, Resolution aid me. [Aside. No, faithless Man; the Mercy you demand, Has had its Hour: And Mercy, granted twice, Is the worst Cruelty to those who grant it. Allow your Penitence sincere to Day; Let but to Morrow come, it vanishes: You dare not plead sincere and constant too; And only Constancy can warrant Love. What have I said? alas, I parly with him; And Parly in a Cause like this is Yielding. Think what thou wer't so lately; and thence learn That what thou art, can ne'er be worth the Notice Of Adeliza, when her injur'd Honour Has rous'd a Fury, Patience long abus'd To fix a Brand on thy apostate Love, And weed thee from her Heart. Leol. Oh! 'tis enough: And I submit. Butâhold my Eyesâthey will not. Yet one Word more; and thenâI die to Morrow: Name my Offence. Adel. The King has nam'd it. Leol. No: My Adeliza must pronounce my Doom: I own no Sovereign else. The World indeed, Mock'd by the Form and Pageantry of Justice, May look no farther for the Blow that ends me, Than Edwin's Sentence: but let Truth be ask'd; And it discovers Him, you stile the King, Him and his Headsman join'd, to be no more Than Executioners of Heavenly Vengeance O'ertaking my Offence to Adeliza. Adel. And not to Him? oh obstinate in Guilt! Leol. To Adeliza, and to Her alone. Adel. Away, mistaken Man. Leol. You wrong me now, Vile as I am: for, Madam, with your Leave, And with your Father's tooâhark! hark! he comes [Shout. With Shouts of Triumph to behold my Death. Adel. The Noise advances, and the Trumpet's Sound [Shout again and Trumpets. Proclaims his Entry now. Leol. I thought him mine; And his Revoltâwas wisely tim'd; without it I might have liv'd, and Justice fail'd, the Justice Due to his Daughter's Wrongs; I fix it there; And beg you, Adeliza, once again, In the last Words you e'er shall hear me speak, By the dear Hours of now forgotten Love; By all our tender Vows and fond Desires, Our soft Complainings and our transient Jars, Such they were once. Adel. Oh! that distracting Once! [Aside. Be dry my Eyes; and for my Heart, no matter. Leol. Nay by the Hate (since Love is now no more) The fix'd Aversion that usurps your Bosom, (The native Seat of Gentleness and Pity) By That and by its Cause, my late Transgression, So black, so heinous as to shame Remorse, Indulge that Hate, and give Revenge a loose In this one Thought, that if the Powers have doom'd me To the vile Death of Violence and Shame, 'Tis for the Wrong I offer'd Adeliza. For thenâ Adel. Oh Heaven! proceed. Leol. Why, then Forgiveness May take its turn, when You, with thousands more Behold my streaming Veins and bounding Head, That sever'd from the Trunk, shall point a while Its trembling Balls on You: Compassion then May force a Wish that this had never been, A Sigh, perhaps a Tear; and glad my Ghost, That disencumber'd thus from Flesh and Pain, Shall watch your Steps by Day, your Dreams by Night, And still unseen attend on Adeliza. Adel. Forbear: I will not, cannot hear you farther. Leol. I go; you grant me then I die your Victim: Remember, I insist on that; farewel. Guards do the Office of my Legs: support me. Once more farewel: Andâ [Exit Leolin guarded. Adel. What? let me supply it. And now since Female Pride has play'd its part In wounding, thro' my own, my Lover's Heart; Some Hurricane like that I feel within, Snatch me to far extended Wilds, unseen, To vent the Pain that racks my lab'ring Mind, More fierce than His, by being more confin'd.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter Gomel and Morvid. Gomel. Are Tudor's Men dispos'd as Edwin order'd? Mor. Sir, they have taken Post within the Court, And mount the Guard. Gom. It was as you foresaw: His Loyalty made haste to shew itself. Mor. And ruin'd your Intelligence at once. Gom. Forbear, my Friend: The King and he approach. Enter Edwin, Albert, Tudor, Matilda and Adeliza. Edwin. You mention'd somewhat that you must unfold, [To Tudor. Importing Leolin and me to know: Conduct the Pris'ner hither. [To Morvid. [Exit Morvid. Tu. Oh! my Master, The good old Caduan! had but he surviv'd To bless this Day! Edw. Alas! his Thread was spun To Nature's utmost Length. Alb. And leaving You To heir his Merits, and redeem his Crown, Well may we hope he died in virtuous Peace; Like him who lights a Lamp to last till Morn, Feeds it with living Oil, and falls asleep. Edw. But, Tudor, was it possible that you, Devoted as you seem'd to Elfrid's Cause, (You sway'd his Councils, and you fought his Battels) Should in your secret Soul be Caduan's Friend? Tud. I was, and trusted once so far, that Caduan (However alter'd at the last) would ne'er Have chosen Edwin for the hardy Task Of Elfrid's Fall, without consulting me. Edw. He chose me not; the Deed was all my own. Tud. But he consented. Edw. No. Gom. You undertook The necessary Work against his Will. Tud. Against his Will? Edw. And frequent Interdictions, That pall'd my Spirit long, and pos'd my Reason. Tud. Was that well done? Edw. Oh! why that Question, Tudor? That Tone? that Look? When you return'd to Duty, The very Moment I could call you mine, A thousand Fiends within my Bosom slumber'd; But waking at your Words, they war anew With fresh Recruits of Terror. Tud. Let me ask (And you shall own I have too just a Cause) What Fury rais'd your uncommission'd Hand To strike at Sovereign Power? Edw. What Fury, said you? Tud. Resolve me, Sir, and with that Clearness too, That Mastery of Mind, and Reach of Reason, That must distinguish him who scans his Heart With all its secret Springs; and thence is taught Severely to remark on his own Actions: To damn what undiscerning Crowds admire, When he discovers a new World at Home, And travails o'er Himself. Edw. Since thus you drive me Ev'n to my inmost Soul, let Her declare [Pointing to Adeliza. The Love that, restive to the sacred Check Of filial Duty, hurried me aloft To Empire's rugged Height: Oh Adeliza! Oh ill requited Love! I ran the Race, And reach'd the Goal, but lost the glorious Prize. Tud. Your genuine Motive then to this Attempt Was hidden from the World; and might not Caduan Have weighty Reasons too to curb your Zeal, And more improper to be told? Mat. He had; He surely had: Have you forgot, my Brother? Edw. I wou'd forget it: but Matilda saysâ Let Her inform you, for she knows it best. Mat. The News of Elfrid's Fall appear'd to shock him; And, oh my Son! he cried, my Son is lost! He rav'd on You. Tud. Remember That: he rav'd On me, and on his Son: But I forbear, Till Leolin appears. His Doom is seal'd? Edw. It is: he dies. Gom. Your mortal Foe declar'd; Breathing Revenge, and deaf to Terms of Grace. Tud. And yet the Publick Voiceâ Edw. Will brand my Justice; Condemn th'Effect, and never weigh the Cause. But, Tudor, they who judge of Kings aright, Must often praise them for the Good they mean, And often clear them of the Bad they act. Re-enter Morvid with Leolin. Tud. Why frowns my Prince, and turns away? Leol. To shun The loathsome Sight of thee. Avant thou base one. The Death thy Treason brings to end my Woes, Will prove a Guest more welcome far. Tud. But hear, First hear me, Sir, and then condemn. My Duty Has brought me hither to discharge a Trust Of near Concernment to your Life and Fame. And now to reconcile a fatal Truth To Your Beliefâ [To Edwin. Edw. Support me Manhood: how! A fatal Truth! I can with Ease believe, And hope to entertain it as I ought. Tud. Permit meâ Edw. Hold. Is Adeliza here? Is she still here? Adel. My Lord, the King. Edw. Oh! stay. All Objects else, Friends, and the Light of Heaven, Grow painful to my Eyes; Dreams, Prodigies, My Father, yours, the Living and the Dead, Combine to mark me out for instant Death: The Giant Skeleton stands full in View At either Door, and guards the Passage hence; Oh! therefore stay a while, and let me breathe My last at Adeliza's Feet. Proceed. Tud. The World has heard, that when unhappy Caduan Abandon'd Albion to his Rival's Arms, The Treaty, that secur'd his Flight, oblig'd him To yield the Foe his Son, then newly born Beneath the Royal Roof: that Treaty, Sir, Was made, but not perform'd on Caduan's Part. Edw. Amazing! not perform'd? you will notâcannot Deny that Leolin was left behind. Tud. That He was left behind, I freely grant; Had He been Elfrid's Son. Edw. Confusion! Death! Leol. Where will this end? Tud. O spare my Tongue, ye Powers, Its mournful Office; let his kinder Genius, That would have held his Arm when Elfrid fell, Groan out the rest. Oh hapless Edwin! Edw. Ha! Your Language labours with important Sense; I hear the solemn Voice of opening Fate; And summon'd to sustain the threaten'd Charge, My Spirits hurry to my throbbing Heart; As at the Signal of approaching Fight, The Warriours, scatter'd o'er the distant Plain, Spur to the Sound, and form the Front of Battle. Gom. A Horror, hitherto unfelt, has seis'd, My guilty Soul, and whispers me within Prepare to meet thy Death, for oh! 'tis near thee. Tud. Now, mark, my Lords: The same distinguish'd Day Disclos'd ye both to Light in Caduan's Court; And he, forsaken Prince, in just Despair Of living to regain the British Crown, What could he better than contrive the means (Whene'er th'Usurper died) to fix it here, [Pointing to Leolin. Here on his Son, by passing him for Elfrid's? Edw. He Caduan's Son? Tud. With Secrecy and Ease We made th'Exchange of Leolin for You; For Caduan was His Sire, and Elfrid Yours. Edw. Now bold Impostor, by the Powers I thank thee: Why, thou hast forg'd a Tale that breaks at once The drowsy Spell, Despair had hung upon me, And wakes me into Rage. This Story, Tudor, Thisâbut it will not be receiv'd on Trust: Produce your Evidence. Tud. I will, Matilda; The Language Caduan in her Hearing utter'd; His dying Fears for Leolin. Edw. For Him? Matilda, was my Rival nam'd? Mat. He was not. Tud. But plainly pointed out: what meant those Words, My Son is lost, unless applied to him, Your Pri'sner, not to you? Why nam'd he me, If not as privy to the fatal Secret? Edw. Away Deceiver: hast thou caught the Hint? Suborn'd the Frenzy of a sick Man's Dreams To colour hell-bred Malice, and support Thy black Invention to supplant my Right, And dash me, blast me with my Father's Murder? No; would'st thou prove me this abandon'd Mark Of Fortune's Spight, beyond Example curs'd, Fetch my Conviction from a Place as dark As that foul Source of Forgery, thy Brain; Ev'n from the Regions of eternal Night: Let Caduan, starting from his iron Sleep, Howl in my Ears, Usurper, Parricide; And then I will believe. Tud. Ev'n he shall speak, Dead as he is; his Image on this Medal [Giving a Medal. Of force shall open your reluctant Eyes, And pour the dismal Blaze of Truth upon them. Edw. This Medal! 'tis the same! and I am lost. Tud. Mark it, for you have one its Counterpart; And none can shew a third. Edw. So Caduan told me: Two only, mine, and this, the same with mine, He said, were struck; and he who brought me this [Giving it back. Was Master of infallible Credentials To gain my firm Belief, whene'er he clear'd (What I have often sought, but still in vain) The shocking Sense of this mysterious Emblem. Tud. The Head of Caduan and the guilty Year [Shewing it to Leolin, &amp;c. That forc'd him from the Throne, are stamp'd upon it; On the Reverse, the Firstling of the Flock, A Lamb abandon'd by its bleating Mother To a pursuing Wolf. That Wolf is Elfrid. These other Figures ropresent the King And Leolin his Son, who, left as Elfrid's, Remain'd in safety, and expounds the Motto, But not to be devoured. Edw. O Mercy Heaven! [Staggers into the Arms of Albert and Morvid. Mercy and Death! Ma. Help! help! Alb. Secure his Sword, Already drench'd too deep in Elfrid's Blood. Tu. The Blow has stunn'd his Senseâbut I forget: Joy to the King. Gom. And Shame, immortal Shame; And Death to Gomel. Tud. Liberty and Joy. Leol. Alas! what Joy to me? my Friend (my Father [Embracing him. I would have added) tell that angry Fair, [Pointing to Adeliza. All you have done to Day, is done in vain; In vain my Life preserv'd, my Crown restor'd, Unless her dear forgiving Lips recall My Doom too justly pass'd. Adel. 'Tis yours to grant The Pardon I should ask. Forgive the Height Of wild Revenge and self-tormenting Pride: Can you forgive, my Lord? I will not plead The Provocation. Leol. No; to spare the Shame That galls Remembrance there, of that no more; But (oh transporting View of promis'd Bliss!) Lose every grating Thought in gay Desire; Indulge my Love, and share my better Fortune. Adel. I meant to share your worst; for Proof behold! This Dagger, furnish'd by a friendly Hand, On the first News of your expected Death, Had pierc'd my stubborn, yet still faithful Heart. [Drops the Dagger. Leol. More Wonder! more Delight! but Language fails me. My Adeliza! 'tis Enchantment, this! Thus to be rescued from impending Fate Beyond my Hope or Thought! to stand possess'd Of all that Life can give! All! All in Thee! Thus in an Instant too! The swelling Joy Would quite o'erwhelm my Soul; but oh! Compassion For ruin'd Edwin checks th'unruly Tide, And saves me once again. How fares he Albert? Edw. Hold, Elfrid, or you run on certain Death. What, are you slain? it is my Father: Murder! Murder and Parricide! why Sister, Friends! I rave; what Sister, or what Friends have I? Nay coward Hands, ye should have trembled thus [Feeling for his Sword. Whenâoh! Tud. So, now his wandring Sense returns. Ah, Sir! Edw. Disarm'd! betray'd! where are my Guards? Where, where indeed? but loss of Sovereign Sway, Heavens I forgive ye That; for Adeliza Was gone before. Stand off, ye would not, sure, Prolong this cursed Life; ye shall not; no, The Bolt, that loiter'd when my Father fell By these polluted Hands, shall now o'ertake, And strike me dead at once. Ma. Be calm my Brother; Alas, I still must call you so. Edw. Inhumane! Will ye not kill me yet? then hide at least, Hide me from Elfrid; there, just there he stands, My murder'd Father, see, he looks as when Extended on the Floor he grasp'd my Hand; I thought it his Death's Pang, but oh! 'twas Instinct; Why had not I the same? I find it now, 'Twas Nature powerful in a dying Father. Leol. Forbear to aggravateâ Ed. Can You delay To punish my Offence? your Vengeance vow'd, Is it so soon forgot? the Sword is yours; But where is now the Heart? or who will follow The Cry of Blood for Blood? for Elfrid's Blood? Who but his Son against his Son? Gom. Have Patience Edw. Hah! Devil art thou there? restore my Sire, Kind and indulgent as I found him, Traytor, When wrought by thee, I took his Smiles for Snares Meant to destroy me: make thy Malice good: What Proof, thou Monster? Leol. Or what Colour? there I second Edwin, and stand forth for Justice. Gom. Hear me, my Lords; I must acknowledgeâ Edw. Do, That thou art of a Piece, thyself throughout: Who hatch'd the Plot to murder Elfrid? Gomel. Who lur'd me on to go and head it? Gomel. Who drove me to Extremes with Leolin? Mock'd me with false Alarms? th'Impostor Gomel. Take thy Reward: If I have done thee Wrong, [Catches up the Dagger, and kills Gomel. Thou hast the Start, and may'st complain to Minos E'er Edwin can be there. [Stabs himself, and falls at Adeliza's Feet. Tud. Malicious Chance, Thus unexpectedly to arm Despair! Adel. What has he done! O desp'rate Act! and mine The fatal Steel! Edw. Now Elfrid be appeas'd; The Hand that slew thee, has reveng'd thee here; Though Heaven is doubly wounded by this Stroke: ButâMercyâcan heal all. [Dies. Ma. Eternal Sorrows Dwell on his Tomb. Alb. And deep Oblivion hide His Failings: But for Him, instead of mourning, I blush for Kindred Blood so justly shed. [Pointing to Gomel's Body. Mor. Mourn him you ought; for he derives his Fall From You, tho' clear of all his Crimes; to pave Your Way to Empire, that Advent'rer launch'd Into a Sea of Guilt, my royal Lord; [Kneeling to Leolin. Forgive me, if, in Zeal for Gomel's Service, Unknowing who you was, I sought your Ruin: For 'twas for him I watch'd your troubled Hours, Play'd with your Passions, and excited Hope, Revenge, Suspicion, and Despair by turns. Leol. Poor groveling Agent of Another's Guilt, Contempt and Infamy be thine: I cannot Remit thee them; thy Life, I do. Let Him [Pointing to Edwin's Body. In all the Pomp of Fun'ral Rites, return To Dust: the Vault, his Piety design'd For both our Fathers, wants no room to hold His Reliques too, and shall at once receive Its three Imperial Guests; for so the Gods Decreed to join their Destinies, that I Restor'd to Life and dearer Love, might climb The Throne, my native Right, by Edwin's Crime: Rash as he was to judge before he knew; To slight his fancied Sire, and slay his true; Let Him to future Times this Truth convey; Where Parents their Commands with Rigour lay, 'Tis specious to dispute, but Prudent to obey.

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by Bevil Higgens, Esq;The following Prologue being forgotten in its proper Place, is inserted here. The Muse discourag'd, is so idle grown, Scarce one new Play has entertain'd the Town: Old Poets hash'd, recook'd and quite defac'd, Support the Stage, and please a vicious Taste. When your fair Mother's that bright Ring adorn'd, [To the Ladies. Good Sense and Poetry not thus were scorn'd; Poor Belvidere drew Tears from every Eye; And all with Pity saw Monimia die. But nowâ After a plenteous Meal of English Meat, Deserts of foreign Farce the Feast compleat: Tack'd to good Plays, the vile Buffoon prevails, And draws an Audience where the Poet fails; No foreign Scenes of Love distress'd we show, But Native Breasts wou'd touch with Native Woe. Let Art and Nature then your Tast restore, While Faustus Harlequin attracts no more.
