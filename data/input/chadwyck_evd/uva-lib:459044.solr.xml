      <field name="fulltext">THE IVST ITALIAN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT Honourable, The Earle of Dorset, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my Friend M. D'avenant, on his legitimate Poeme. Even so the silly Midas iudg'd of old 'Twixt Pan and great Apollo. As this bold Herd, of his race, that th'untun'd Pipe admire, And heare thy straynes, as the dull Asse the Lyre. What wonder then, if thou the lawfull Son Of PhÃ¦bus, taste what was to him begun. Hence, giddy fooles; run to the noyse they make At Paris-garden; or your selues betake To the new Motion, the fine Puppet playes, And there adore. Commend the learned layes That make a din about the streets, or els Extoll the Iewes-trumpe, or the morris bells. These, your great heads may manage. Only let The wiser few, (whose blessed eares haue met The harmony that all the Muses make, And from those heauenly sounds assurance take, That thou sing'st the same tunes) admitted be To thy Seraphyck musicke, and set free To entertayne their soules in that high quire, Which, not weake fooles, but such as know, admire. Will. Hopkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my worthy Friend, M. D'Avenant, Vpon his Excellent Play, The Iust Italian. Ile not misspend in prayse, the narrow roome I borrow in this leafe; the Garlands bloome From thine owne seedes, that crowne each glorious page Of thy triumphant worke; the sullen Age Requires a Satyre. What starre guides the soule Of these our froward times, that dare controule, Yet dare not learne to iudge? When didst thou flie From hence, cleare, candid Ingenuity? I haue beheld, when pearchd on the smooth brow Of a fayre modest troope, thou didst allow Applause to slighter workes; but then the weake Spectator, gaue the knowing leaue to speake. Now noyse preuayles, and he is taxd for drowth Of wit, that with the crie, spends not his mouth. Yet aske him, reason why he did not like; Him, why he did; their ignorance will strike Thy soule with scorne, and Pity: marke the places Prouoke their smiles, frownes, or distorted faces, When, they admire, nod, shake the head: they'le be A scene of myrth, a double Comedie. But thy strong fancies (raptures of the brayne, Drest in Poetique flames) they entertayne As a bold, impious reach; for they'l still slight All that exceeds Red Bull, and Cockepit flight. These are the men in crowded heapes that throng To that adulterate stage, where not a tong Of th'untun'd Kennell, can a line repeat Of serious sense: but like lips, meet like meat; Whilst the true brood of Actors, that alone Keepe naturall vnstrayn'd Action in her throne Behold their Benches bare, though they rehearse The tearser Beaumonts or great Iohnsons verse. Repine not Thou then, since this churlish fate Rules not the stage alone; perhaps the State Hath felt this rancour, where men great and good, Haue by the Rabble beeene misunderstood. So was thy Play; whose cleere, yet lofty strayne, Wisemen, that gouerne Fate, shall entertayne. Tho. Carew.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Scene Florence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act the first. Scene the first. Enter Meruolle, Altamont. Meruolle. This puzles my beliefe: the sickly Moone Hath not yet twice expir'd her vsuall change Since you did mingle Soules, and can it be That she so soone recoyles from grace Harmonious quiet of your bed? Altamont. My Deare Meruolle she is lost: As well may I Collect the scatter'd windes into a bagge, Or from the watry surface scrape the gilt Reflections of the Sunne, as bring her heart Within the quiet list of wiues that will Obay and loue. Meruolle. Can the Duke (her Vnkle) Giue an encouragement to her reuolt, Maintaine the females Charter 'gainst the male? Altamont. Him, and his supreame title she still names To iustifie the glory of her birth, And then recites the Vilages and wealth, She brought to me for dowre, in parallell With what I formerly possess'd, she doth Affront my memorie with stories of My leane and niggard fate, and vrging then Her vast supplies, doeth challenge leaue to call Her pride and rigour iust. Meruolle. This griefe is of Sad quality! Altamont. The heart hangs heauie on The strings, when it alone containes the cause And knowledge of its weight: for troubled windes In their dispersion loose their strength; so griefes, Whilst th'are reueal'd, diminish from themselues. But the calamities, that doe perplex The Nuptiall bed, are of a propertie Recluse, and must be hidden euen from friends: For on such secrets Fame doeth feede with fierce, And meagre appetite; and as swift Fame Doeth trauaile with them, they increase. So much Comerce I haue with humane Arts, that I Can steepe my Gall in my owne teares; and make That salt which she intended bitter; Shew Her crime to spring, not from poyson'd mallice, But from the feminine mistakes of wit: For moderne Courts now preach, wit doeth reside In Ladies subtle riots, and their pride. Enter Florello, Rossa, Molard; in souldierly meane habits. Meruolle. Behold your brother (sir) whose safe returne, This morne I mention'd to your eareâ Altamont. Thy growth Hath so orereach'd my sight, that I'm estrang'd To my best blood: and but, thy figure in My heart I weare (by which my memory's Enform'd) I should not know I had thee heereâ Florello. I reckon this the chiefe delight I haue Receiu'd on Earth. And (sir) your loue is of Such sou'raigne qualitie, a little soone Will ouercharge my sense. Giue but a part To me, the rest conferre vpon my friendsâ Who, though in witherd habits, doe deserue, Societie with Kings: for neuer yet, Did bolder Souldiers listne to the Drumme. Altamont. Gentlemen, ye shall enrich my knowledgeâ Rossa: Noble Signior, vnprofitable loue Is all our wealthâ Molard. But wee'le contriue our selues For your best vse.â Florello. I'ue sayd, consider them Within; their weedes are ouergrowne and cheape. Altamont. Brother (how ere wise fate may answere it) Me thinks, these your owne robes are not o'th right Tyrian dy; nor hath the rich weight of your Tall Plume the Estridge rob'd of both her winges. Florello. Euen thus (sir) poore, and with small victory Am I return'd from our cast Troopes. Our pay Rests in Areres, and Pisa's lost: But you (I heare) haue fond a Iewell, that containes All price and lustre; and you doe weare it In your bosome: (a noble wife) whose birth And beautie, are alike vnuallu'd as Her dowre. This I encounterd on The Lips of Fame; and I made haste to share In your successe, and put your bounty to The test. Altamont. Florello, I haue lost my sleepe. Things differ much from the sinceritie Of their first growth: Alteza hath forgot Th'allegiance of a wife, she doth practise How with her riot to impouerish States, And by her loftie pride, to iustifie The immortalitie of flesh: This Theame Is sad; but I will giue you cause t'expect The vtmost strength and power of my reliefe. Florello. You teach my feeble wants a confidence. Altamont. If you a while obscure your selfe (for feare Your pouertie increase her scorne) you shall Performe a rationall request. Our young Faire Sister, is conceald for the same cause. Florello. Your mention doth anticipate my loue. Is our faire Sister well? Altamont. Shee doth enioy Rare beautie, and much health. Meruolle. I heare your wife. Alta. You and your friends, moue backe, and be not seene. Enter Alteza, Charintha, Niente. Alteza. Trie Signior Allidore, Antonio's sonne: Vtruuio, or the rich Pirracco. Gritalin, or old Contarini of Placentiaâ Niente. Madam, your husband hath Protested 'gainst your credit, euen to these. Alte. Slaue, goe force an answere more delightfull. Niente. I obay you Madam. exit. Alteza. Is't come to this? I'le be a crooked Spinster first, and with My spittle and my flaxe procure my bread. Altamont. What is the cause my Princesse thus delights In frownes? Anger sits on her brow like age. Alteza. Hence, I see thee, and my eyes shrinke into My skull: the Rauen's not so ominous and blacke. Altamont. Yet vrge the cause (my Loue) why your Defiance is so violent and lowd? Alte. A Millainois shew'd me to day for sale, Bright and spacious Iewels; but in the darke, Your pusill malice hath betrai'd my faith, With Merchants. You haue now my credit wrought So low, and cheape; I cannot stand deposd For th'triuiall loane of fortie thousand crownes. Altamont. I would suruay a list of all your wants, That I may so haue power to hasten the Redresse: Doe you dislike your properties Of house, your Vestments, or seruice of your Table; Giue but a name vnto thy wish? Alteza. I would haue my Orchardâpau'd with Aggats. Altamont. O, and your garden walls rais'd high, t'hedge in Paraquetos, and th'rhetoricall Dawe? Altera. Thou hast a rude heart, and a blisterd tongue! Charintha. Well, the first day of your coniunction Sir, I little thought you would haue vsd her thus. Meruolle. Charintha's become her Sisters Pupill. Florello. And I perceiue a masculine itch beneath Her left eye; she longs to taste man. Altamont. Come Loue, Be gentle as thy bridall smiles: for by Thy selfe I sweare, my speech did purpose nought, To tempt thy spleene. Lend me thy melting hand! Alte. Thereâ'tis to reach backe the heart I gaue yeâ Altamont. You spirits that secure the propertie Of humane loue, be still officiall heere! Why should we not for euer thus remaine, Incorporate, and conioyn'd. Tis sympathie, And loue, that giues the world continuance And life. Each species Loue preserues. Tis loue That makes th'eternall Wisedome thus forbeare The silly crimes of dull humanitie: And suffers vs, like each delighted flie, To play the triuiall wantons in his eye. Alteza. You preach of loue, but your obedience would More pleasure me. Altamont. This argues thy reuolt! And is a stratagem against nature. Thou wouldst vsurpe the Charter of the male Tis my confession, that thy dowre was vaste And opulent, and such as may support Thy titles, and thy birth, with all the pride And cunning of magnificence. Let my Sincere phrase instruct thy heart. Reassume The blushes of thy youth; with timerous Modestie behaue thy gesture and thy tongue, And then, thou shalt stand vp exemplary To all triumphant Courts: the enuie of The Easterne Queenes: th'Astrologers mistake, Who shall direct their Opticks vnto thee, As to a new and vnknowne Starre. Alteza. Sister!â Altamont. The small Musitions of the aire (whom Queenes With mimicke falconrie doe pearch vpon Their fists) shall be thy food. Thy maides shall eate Young Pelicanes, and Squirils hearts. Alteza. Exc'lent! Altamont. Thy beuiridge shall be propheticke, and Diuine; for thou shalt drinke that sou'raigne dew, That hangs vpon the frighted Lillies cheeke, And brew'd with Syrens teares, such as they shed In reall obsequies. Alteza. O bounteous Sir!â Altamont. The soft entraile o'th Persian worme, th'Ermines Pale fur, shall cloth thy limmes. Alteza. More precious still! Altamont. Those gums and spices which the Arabian bird, Collects to make her tragicke piles, shall be Thy winter fewell. Alteza. Prettie Sir, proceed! Alta. Thou shalt haue Marmasets, and Dwarfs, the male And female too, to procreate in thy house; That thy delights may euer be renew'd. Thy Iewels shall increase, as if the lou'd Indies were thy Quarrie. Th'Almightie Sunne Shall rise, and see a nobler day breake from Thy Cabinet, then yet the illustrious East Ere knew. Alteza. But how will you performe these hopes? Altamont. The miracle, and power, doe both consist, In my large wealth. Alteza. Death on my Tribe! Your wealth? Altamont. I, my sweet Loue. Alteza. Your wealth? Altamont. This iteration Scarce will delight, if it be negatiue. Alteza. Canst thou persist in such accursed schisme? Altamont. Did you not then intend, when you endow'd Me with your wealth, that I should call it mine? Alteza. By heauen not I. I forfeited the loue O'th'great Duke (my Vnkle) to marry thee; That wert a thing shrunke from thy fate, and lost Vnto the lippes and eyes of men; but yet In most assured hope, that thou wouldst prooue, An humble and obedient husband. Altamont. Th'art more impudent, then the Basiliske, Who stares i'th blessed face of man, vntill He kill him with his eyes. Alteza. Heare Altamont! For I will giue solemnitie vnto A vow, that shall for euermore, diuide Thee from my bedâ Meruolle. Deare Madam hold! Each fence Of mine doth blush, that can perceiue, your wild, Rebellious wrath. Hath not the Church nam'd him Your husband, and your Lord? Alteza. M'opinions of The Church, I'le tell to'th Conclaue, not to youâ Altamont. Is this the helpe, Diuinitie gaue man? Snuffe the Moone, she burnes dimme. The Spheares are now Ill tun'd, and aged nature backward reeles. Alteza. Thy anger's vaine. Heere I doe banish thee My bed: And we will neuer more embrace. Altamont. Rebellious fiend. Alteza. I now diuide my house: This side is mine, with the dimensions that Dependance haue on this square frame: for heere My familie and I will rule. That side You, and your meagre ragged traine possesse. Thou mayst hencefoorth my neighbour, but no more My husband be. Charintha, come awayâ Altamont. I must pursue, lest she her anger make Too lowd, so we inuite the publike scorne. Exeunt Alteza, Charintha: Altamont. Meruolle. Is not thy brothers wife a pure tame henne? How dost thou like her noyse? Florello. Were she but mine, I'ld teach her keepe a noyse too after death. Meruolle. How so? Florello. I'ld strippe her skinne o're her eares and Make a drumme on't. Rossa. She was borne in a storme! Molard. And begot sure with the Boeswayns whistle. Florello. Meruolle, you haue nam'd Charintha, As a precious Virgine, of nature most Remisse, a quiet tongue, and such a heart, As might become an able sacrifice, T'expiate the whole world? Meruolle. This I esteem'd My iustice on her merits, but it seemes Her Sisters documents ore rule her now. Her dowry is of ample rate, and may Deserue the chiefe of our Italian youth. Florello. What's Dandalo, that sues to her for loue? Meruolle. Dandalo, the Count of Millaine? A thing Composd of spicery and starch! Nature Contriu'd him in her sleepe. If's ignorance Might answere for his sinnes; he would accompt Amongst his wealth, the land he has in Heauen. Florello. I heard you say, she neuer saw him yet. Meruolle. Neuer Sir: He wooes her by his letters. She desiring a personall suruay Ere prosecution of the sute, he sent Her word, he'ld make's addresse by stealth; but we Expect him not ere'th'birth of the next Moon. Florello. Will his ariuall be so long delay'd?â Brother!âHow thriues your patience ore your wife? Alta. Some Philosophicke hope remaines: the storme Can't last, because 'tis still more violent. Sh'ath tane Caroch for the Pallace, and meanes Straite to disgrace me to the Duke By her complaints. Meruolle. Her vaines oreflow with Gall! Altamont. Florello, I desire thou'lt not appeare Before her eye, vntill thy habit's chang'd. My present power summes but a thousand crownes, Which I haue brought, and prostrate to thy vseâ Giues him a Bagge. Florello. Sir it is fit your blessings were encreasd; And that your wife had read your worth. Altamont. My Art betrayes my hopes, or I haue found A remedy to cure her pride: your helpe Meruolle, I must craue, and with swift speed: Exeunt Altamont, Meruolle. Florello. Rossa, Molard, (friends to my Soule and Braine) Aduance your subtle Eyes! The sou'raigne mine Behold, that makes the solemne Patriarke dance, And the anointed King to skippe, as doth His limber Dwarfe. Rossa. Yellow as foot of Kite! Molard. Shall we be tender natur'd, and diuide? Florello. This is the portion will procure vs all High dignitie and place. Rossa, you must Find cause to number theseâGoe, ransome out Our captiue weedes, and the rich habit I From Pisa brought: whilst you (Mollard) with the Assistance of these fewâprocure vs fit Materials to adorne, and put in bright Aspect our Corps. Enquire for Pearles! Stones of The cunningst soyle, we'le like them, and disburse. Rossa. Is there some aged vessell now asleepe In the Docke, that will pay for her calking? Molard. Florello, must we stop the publike leakes? Florello. Ere long we shall be great, be able to Aduance with smiles, and with our frownes destroy. You Rossa, I'le create a Magistrate. Goe practise the austeere Cough. Pale dilinquents Thou shalt learne to ieere, and to sleepe ore men Condemn'd. Rossa. The calling (Sir) I doe vouchsafe. Florello. Thou (my Molard) shalt rule in Villages, Grow popular, and mistake the Lawes. Thou shalt Delight i'th Kallender: the Rubricke dayes Thou shalt obserue, and then destroy thy beefe. Whilst thy dull earthie Tennants feede vntill They smell. Molard. My Launcepresado then shall sop His Crust in Cyder and in wine! Rossa. And my Dread Corporall shall sinne no more for Leekes, His Girdle and his socks he shall vnpawne. Florello. The solitarie Hostesse shall no more Boyle the Carion meate that she must trust, In her owne teares; Nor with a Requiem bring The seruice vp, as if it were the Haunch Of her dead Husband. Rossa. I am intire flame! Florello. The Geographicke Captaine shall no more Studie the Towne Mappe, that's darke walkes may be Contriu'd through slender Allies and through Lanes, To scape his hungrie Creditors abroade. Rossa. Thy Prouince is Chaldea, thy Father Was a Rabby! Molard. And thy Aunt a Sybill! Florello. These are the victories of wit: by wit We must atchieue our hopes; which to refine And purifie, with paces doubled let's Descend a Marble vault, there taste the rich Legitimate blood of the mighty Grape. Tis precious as the milke of Queenes; such as Would teach dull Saturne laugh. It magnifies The heart, and makes the a gill spirits dance, It drownds all thoughts adulterate and sad; Inspires the Prophet, makes the Poet glad. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act the second. Scene the first. Enter Altamont, Meruolle, Scoperta. Altamont. I haue receiu'd a mandate from the Duke, That will (I feare) increase her insolence. Like an old Tyrant he bestowes his threats; As if his anger did obay his will, Not iustice, nor the Lawes. Meruolle. Does your wife know This preparation you haue made to cure Her haughtinesse? Altamont. All is discouerd to Her care: the newes hath taught her boyle her heart In her owne blood. She now weepes vineger; Boasts of reuenge, as if the Thunder were Her owne. Meruolle. T'were fit your pretty Agent heere, Receiu'd instructions how to shape her garbe And port, iust as th'imployment doth require. Altamont. Her knowledge is already satisfi'd: Alteza's threats shall onely mooue her scorne. Scoperta. I will performe my best in your behalfe; But I doe feare I am not valiant Sir. Enter Niente. Altamont. O, you! that call your sinnes your duty, that Obay your Ladies riots out o'zeale!â Niente. Signior!â Altamont. Her honours spittle you preserue As a Restoratiue for your salt itch Niente. I beseech yeâ Altamont. You thrid in Bracelets too, The Pearles that drop from her authenticke nose. Niente. What meane you Sir? Altamont. To cleaue you from the scalpe Vnto the twist: to make nine skittles of Your bones, and winde your heratstrings 'bout my thumbeâ Niente. O mercy Sir! So rotten are my Limmes That when you stretch your Cheekes and blow on me, I strait am scatter'd into sandâ Altamont. Coward! Creepe strait into my Houreglasse then, and there Eternally distinguish fatall timeâ Enter Alteza. Alteza. What slaue disturbs the quiet of my Eare? Niente steps behinde her. Niente. Nere looke Sir! I serue my Lady; and I Doe scorne to yeeldâ Altamont. D'ye bristle Porcupine?â Niente. Take heed!âI haue the mallady of Franceâ Alteza. Stay Altamont! withdraw thy violence! If thou disorderst but a haire, that doth Belong to th'Eyebrow of my meanest Groome, I will proclaime my superioritie And rule i'th'Streets. Altamont. Hell cannot misse thee long! Alteza. Insult beneath thy owne low Roose! This part O'th' House doth call me soueraigne She spies Scoperta, and comes neere her. Altamont. Retire! Alteza. Is that the Peece you haue so magnifi'd, She you boast of for your pastime Royall? Altamont. She clips the grey and shiuer'd wings of Time To make him slow; that our imbraces like Succeeding minutes then, may adde vnto Their length. Let me ingender on thy lipsâ Scoperta. So our progeny may still be kissesâ Altamont. A meeke and gentle heate, whilst thus we bill We imitate the sober lust of Douesâ ScopertÃ¦. That kisse (Sir) was so powerfull and moist, That you haue robd my Lips of all their wealth! Altamont. Take backe thy wealth againe!â Alteza. Are ye so hot?â Altamont. Thy Lips are thin and lanke (Alteza) as The Lids that close thine Eyes. Hers gently swell Like Easterne fruit, and are more soft then is The fleecy Aire that clothes the Infant Morne. Alteza. Pray a word! Is there in this Pagentry Ought like to truth? Discouer your intent! Altamont. I'le make my anger equall vnto thine, And my reuenge aboue them both. This bright Auspicious Maid shall gouerne in my bed. She is my Concubine: the Off spring of Her wombe shall triumph heere, maugre thy sight: Whilst enuie does consume thy flesh vntill Thy bodie lighter grow then thy loose mind. Alteza. How well my Starres behaue their influence? Altamont. Meruolle, goe! my Mistresse guide vnto Those lodgings that oreuiew the Garden mount. Scoperta. If you retard your presence whilst the Sunne (In's race) fill vp one Howre, you'le find before Your next reuiew, that griefe hath made me old, And I shall looke more like a Matron then A Bride; so much your absence mortifies. Altamont. Thou art to euerie sense I haue, a Spell. Conduct her strait (Meruolle) to some Throne! Exeunt Meruolle, Scoperta. Alteza. Then are the vowes, the Ecclesiasticke rites With which the zealous Priest oblig'd vs to Peculiar heate, to abstinence from change, And various loue, quite cancell'd by your lust? Altamont. Accuse thy pride! Alteza. Thou art a periur'd man! Altamont. Goe, thou art as light as feathers, or the Aire, were but an Attome indiuiduall plac'd With thee in ballance euen, t'would hoise thee vp To th'Cloudes. Alteza. Thy breath is fulsome as that steame Which Toades when they ingender vaporate. Altamont. Alteza, bath in penitentiall teares Thy leprous heart, or when the Elements Are mix'd and the sad day ariues, that doomes The world vnto eternitie of ioy, Or paine, thou shalt (like to a glimmering Lampe) Be hung vpon the sootie walles of Hell. Alteza. I smile at thee, and thy thinne Arts; like to Some homelie Village Leuite, thou doest preach Of terrours strange, to keepe dull faith in awe: I pray stay; I am not angrie Sir. Altamont. No? Alteza. I practisd all this while how t'indanger your spleene (Sir) not my owne which if my powers Prooue iust, I shall, performe ere long. Niente, send the partie inâ Exit Niente. Altamont. More wrath! Alteza. A slow deuice (Sir) but o'my owne Braine. Enter Sciolto. Altamont. Who art thou? Sciolto. A keene Guest, inuited heereâ Altamont. To what? Scioeto. To tasteâyour wiues Gammons. Altamont. Bold slaue! be in thy speech more euident. Sciolto. I am come to get your children for you. Alteza. D'ye want a cleerer paraphrase? He is My seruant Sir, my stallion if I please. A Courtly implement, and much in vse Among Ladies of my growth and Title. Alta. O my cold Blood! My patience will be wrought So low, that I shall learne t'mike a Heifer. Alteza. Since I'me so aptly furnish'd with delight, Your Concubine may fearelesse walke about The house, and share the wholesome Sunne in peace. Altamont. Thy tongue I doe neglect: but you (sir) shall Ere long complaine of your mortality: The minutes you must waste on Earth are few. Sciolto. This I consider Sir, and therefore make Such haste to mingle with your wife; that the Kinde world may haue some issue from my Loynes. Alta. If this prooue true, let Babes pisse out my Eyesâ He drawes his sword, Sciolto his, Alteza her stilleto. Alteza. Hold Altamont, or else I wound thy heartâ Sciolto. If you aduance one inch beyond that rush I'le amble through the Streets, and blow your Dirge With the great Horne that growes vpon your Brow. Altamont. If there be Gall in Heauen, the gen'rall Bagge Is opned, and it falls in Showres! Sciolto. S'light Sir; I come t'ease the labour of your Body; And you want courtship to returne me thanks. Alteza. Hang him Ingrate! Sciolto. But what hereafter I Performe, shall be for your good Ladies sake, And not for yours. Altamont. Pray (sir) let's interchange A little breath: withall (if you consent) We'le put our Swords to a more quiet vseâ Sciolto. Now Sir, you powre sweet Cassia in my Broath. My Blood affects to skirmish more With Ladies then with men. What would you speake? Altamont. My true opinion sir concerning you. I know you doe but countrfeit this Iust, This lawlesse heate. You purpose not t'abuse the Charter of my Bed, Sciolto. Who told ye so? Altamont. I read it in your noble feature and Your lookes. You haue Religion in your shape. And can it be, you should so soone commit a crime So much vnwholsome to the Angels sight? Let me now make a forfeiture of Eyes, If euer I beheld a man that's more oblig'd To Nature for his Limmes. A carnall frame So full of equall strength I neuer saw. Scioleo. The better shap'd I am (Sir) the more cause You'le find, to loue the Issue I shall get Vpon your wife. Altamont. Doe not belie thy owne True merits and comport! Th'adulterate fire Did nere inflame thy sober heart, I know Thou scornst to do't. Sciolto. Not I beleeue it Sir! Sir I will doe't. Is your Lady fruitfull? I would be loath t'loose my labour on her? Altamont. Pestilence! and blood! He drawes, and they as before. Alteza. Fling a danger from Thy arme, I'le summon strait (with Trumpet and with Drumme) the world to heare thy infamieâ Sciolto. O fie! You an Italian Sir, and thus Behaue the knowledge of disgrace with lowd And popular dislike? Alteza. Nay it becomes You finelie, does it not? Sciolto. You thinke because Y'are curs'd, we'le allow you short Hornes: I'le graft Vpon your head a paire so tall, they shall Goe neere to pricke the verie Planet (Sir) Thet rul'd at your natiuitie. Alteza. He sleepes. Sciolto. Signior, goe! take downe a Cushion, and pray! You cannot choose but know the frailty of The times: the surfeits of the wombe, and how Great Ladies doe relieue their Appetites. Your owne confession of my parts commends Your wife in her sage choice. There be that sinne With feeble vshers and the witherd Dwarfe. Alteza. He wants a iudgement to consider this. Sciolto. I merit better looks Sir, that must thrash All night for ye, and without wages Sir! Alteza. Dead as a monument! Let vs leaue him!â Sciolto. Had he the Deuill for's Physitian chose, He could nere haue come by the like Cordiall.â Exeunt Sciolto, Alteza. Alta. You swelling mountains (that oreuiew the Earth) Fall now, make me eternally vnseene! Philosophie contract thy meeke sage brow: Let Patience be no more thy Saint. As soone Giue med'cines to the dead, teach statues how To walke, and angry windes to sleepe i'th North. As soone bid emptie Lions play with Kids; And to the shaggie Scythian say, Goe weepe As Virgines doe, when their Loues interre: The blind and shuffled Elements that first In Chaos stroue, were not so opposite As this Religious frost vnto my heate. Patience, thou art more fond then teeming wiues, Tamer then sseepe! Diuinitie which calls Our anger sinne, and courage pride, hath sent This sillie Cherubine on Earth, Patience, (The Cowards sword) which onlie doth disarme Dull sleepe, that neither can nor would doe harme. Exit. Enter Sciolto, Alteza, Niente. Sciolto. Florence knowes me well: I'm call'd Sciolto, Alteza. I needs must sing my vshers praise: he made A most discreete election of a man. Sciolto. Your mercie and your kindnesse (Lady) thus Aduance my shape; your pleasure was I should despise your husbands frownes, and I behau'd My selfe with terrour masculine: but now We are peculiar and reseru'd, I know Humilitie, a soft and quiet garbe; A distance that shall well become the state So eminent and rich a beauty claimes. Alteza. Sir, that we doe expect, and then you shall Oretake our noble Sense, with newer loue. Our husband is a trifle, such as can No way disturbe your peace or safetie heere. Sciolto. Madam, store me with armes and weapons to Resist his personall assault, and I Shall need no more protection then my selfe. Alteza. Actiue and bold! Niente thou hast made A choice out-parallels the world. Niente. Madam, See his horse vaines: th'are large as Conduit pipes; His Sinnews are like Cables. Sciolto. Las! not mine! Tis true, that if I like my Opposite, I haue a tricke te giue an easie fall, And stand to't stifly too when I ha'doneâ Niente. I will assure your Ladiship, the Bawdes Giue him good report. Alteza. Doe they Niente? Niente. He's great with Ladies of all ages, all Degrees. Sciolto. Excuse me Sir, th'are great by me! Alteza. As how Sir? Sciolto. MadamâThey are all wi'child! Alteza. How Signior? Is your appetite so strong? Sciolto. Blame the humorous Planets that orerule The blood. Ere yet this present Month expires; (Let's seeâI,!) Some three and forty Ladies (Or there about) will quicken with male Twinnes. Alteza. All of your begetting? Sciolto. So wise Fame sings. I will make bold to gather my first fruitsâ Goes to kisse her. Alteza. Stay my pregnant Signior! Our loue is not Yet ripe: there is a larger distance too Belongs vnto our Lips. Sciolto. How deare Lady? Alteza. I am too proud to haue my fauours soone and easilie conferr'd. Such smiles are cheape. I meane to procreate by prescription Sir, Make my lust as physicall as my meales. Sciolto. Death, I'm Sutor vnto Gallens widdow! Madam, I know it not becomes the high Demeanure of your birth to dance (iust like A Kid) to th'musicke of each wind that blowes. Ere you admit of dalliance I should vse Some industry of Tongue, and flexure of the pliant Ioints, to court and wooe consent. Alteza. And can your rudenesse couet then where your Safe wit and knowledge warnes your abstinence? Sciolto. Only a little t'recreate the Chineâ Alteza. Keepe backe, if you'le continue life. When I Am pleasd to be delighted Sir, I can command the function of your Limmes. Charintha within. Madam! Alteza. Sister, I come. Throw him to his chamberâ Sciolto. Hast no good booke, whose comfortable vse may fill th'expence of time? Alteza. What would you read? Sciolto. Any o'th Moderns. Rablays i'th praise of Midwiues. Aretine on copulation. Or th'Odes of Theophile vnto his whore. Alteza. My Vsher in my closet can appoint Your choice of these. Sciolto. Thinke on the frailtie of The flesh; and be not long vnmercifullâ Charintha within. Sister! Madam! Alteza. Away; I come, I come. Exeunt Niente, Sciolto: Enter Charintha, Besognia. Charintha. The Millaine Count (my Sutor) is ariu'd. Alteza. Signior Dandolo! Why 'tis yet a month Ere he should meet your expectation heere. Besognia. Tis he Madam, and such a he as must Be onely likened to himselfe. Charintha. More rich, And gaudie then the East. So lib'rall too, That you would thinke he Natures Steward were. He giues amongst my slaues, as if vnto Embassadours he did cast Donatiues. Alteza. Milke him (my Charintha) oft I haue preach'd Vnto thine Eare a sou'raigntie ore man. Take all he giues, it's princely fashion now. Could but thy acceptation begger him, Thy little wit were euer magnifi'd. Charintha. You know I am o'th'wits, I haue bin sworne To begger Sutors, and ieere my husband. Enter Florello in rich habit. Rossa, Molard, shifted like his seruants. Florello. Which is the Ladie that I come to wooe? Charintha. My name's Charinthaâ Florello. Present me thy Lips! I say aduanceâ Alteza. You are not vnderstoodâ He kisses Charintha, then giues her a Iewell. Charintha. My Lord, I scarcely owne desert enough T'intice this Iewell from your Cabinet. Florel. A Stone, a Stone! the thing growes, I'ue enowâ Alteza. So free? I am Charintha's Sister Sirâ Florello. It may be so. A fine house, fine Towne too! Were Florence mine, I would not giue it for The best winter Seate my father left me. Alteza. Tis Sir, th'ambition of my loue, that you Would know me for Charintha's Sister!â Florello. I shall. Rossa, remember it! Rossa. My Lord! Florello. I must know her for Charintha's Sister. Charintha. Is there no tricke in ceremonie Sir, To giue your memorie a better hint? Florello. Kisse none but thee! A deuice i'th'blood! but Princes haue one toy or other still, t'make Their descent knowne.âThere, a Diamond that, And that a Ruby.â Giues to Alteza. Alteza. What meanes your Lordship? Florello. Th'are none of mine. I haue enow, weare emâ Alteza. Your Lordship binds my great acknowledgement. I'th leasure of a winke, he'le giue away An Empire. Besognia. I'm Charintha's woman Sirâ Florello. Who can helpe it? Mistresse, wilt thou not bid My seruants welcome? Th'are rich Choughs, th'aue store Of Villages, and plough'd Earth. Charintha. Their iudgment is So kind (Sir) as to know they may command The house. Rossa, Molard. We thanke your Ladiship. Florello. This is my Parasite, and this my Pimpe. I'ue a Foole, a Dwarfe too at home. I made My iaunt too early by a month, or else My Traine had beene enlarg'd. Alteza. Th'are rarely fix'd, If they import as much as you denominate. Florello. I keepe my parasite to cure the dull Melancholy of State. He does admire My wit and Beard. He sayes I cannot sinne. Princes would still be sad but for such worrmes. Alteza. But how (Sir) does your Pimpe adhere to vse? Florello. He is as pertinent to Lords as Iust. My Foole I keepe to laugh at me. My Dwarfe Is for my wife. I doe intend she shall Affect the Court, and then she'le quickly learne. To make the Toy vsefull. Charintha. My Lord, be pleasd To walke, and vse th'aduantage of the Aire. Florello. I'ue Instruments distinct, that take a charge O'th seuerall quarters of my Frame, My Dwarfe Doth dresse me vp vnto the knees, and when His stature leaues his reach, young Virgines then (Th'issue of decay'd Barons) do beginne And gouerne to the Nauell. Whilst vpwards Barbars, Painters, and Parasites are vs'd. Charin. But will your Lordship walke and see the spring? We haue a Garden where it euer dwels. Florello. And shall we be delighted and entranc'd? Charintha. We'le sacrifice the vtmost of our wealth And loue, t'expresse your welcome Sir. Florello. Wilt'I faith. There's a Saphyre Chaine: Tie thy Monkie in'tâ Take it; for by this hand I am in haste And cannot offer twice. Besognia. If you should chance (My honourd Lord) to drop those trifles heere, I would be mannerly, and reach'em vp. Florello. I will giue thee a Bushell of Seed-Pearle To imbroider thy Petticoate. Charintha. This wayâ Rossa. Your Lordship hath forgot to leaue notice for Those Princes in diguise that shall by chance Demand ye at the gate. Alteza. Who does he meane? Florello. A leash of Germane Dukes that walke in Rugge. I should consult with 'em 'bout subuersion Of a State or two; but I'm not yet at Leasure. Alteza. My Lord, they shall be answerd so. Rossa. Your hypocrisie wants a little Art. Molard. Your bounty will impouerish vs too soone. Florello. Ye both doe lie, I weaue my cunning close. Fortune, redeeme the credit of thy Eyes.

      <field name="fulltext">Act the third. Scene the first. Enter Altamont, Meruolle. Sciolto at the other doore. Altamont. This is the truth, therefore consider now my Fate. Hah! Sciolto! Meruolle. What makes he there. Altamont. Tis Sciolto, the brute Adulterer, He whom I lately mention'd in my speech. A slaue more salt then is the Balticke ware, More hot then hell, a Satyre or a Goate. Sciolto. And shall be still so (Sir) vnlesse your wife Dismisse her pride, and vouchsafe to coole me. Alta. Deuils and death, I'm murderd through the Eareâ He drawes, Sciolto puls foorth a case of Pistols, Sciolto. Take discipline awhile, Know if there be A boisterous motion vsd, I haue for each Of you a round Synamon Plumme, and they Shall enter your nice stomacks the wrong wayâ Altamont. Though thou wert hardy as the Lions race; And arm'd with all th'Artillery on Earth, I durst assault thee as I am; but so I cannot satisfie Reuenge. Meruolle. Sciolto, now my memory begins To know you better: for your riots bold And lowd demeanure in this City hath Beene long obseru'd. I wonder much y'imploy Your precious minutes in a course so vile. Sciolto. What, as to copulate and increase kind? It has been a vocation euer since The Sunne spi'd man thus crawling on the Earthâ Meruolle. But what excuse canst thou in honour vrge, for wearing such aduantagious defence, Against his iust and single violence? Sciolto. I haue an odde humor, not to be kill'd. Altamont. O Alteza, had but my name beene hid Beneath some fold in the voluminous Darke booke of Fate, I might haue miss'd of my Creation then, so I should nere haue seene Thy face. Sciolto. My curses (Sir) haue cause t'assault Her more then yours: for she has staru'd me heere With want of naturall delight. My free Large growth and tincture of my haire denote, My constitution cannot suffer me, To weare a surplesse, or proceed Eunuch. Though I should bath and swimme in Iulips Sir, I'ue still vnrulie heate about my Chine. Altamont. A Salamander that doth feede and cloth It selfe with flame, was thy Progenitor. Sciolto. Haue I not equall reason to complaine? In three Houres not so much as a drie kisse. Th'old amorous Deacon that imbrac'd his Cow Was not so destitute. Meruolle. Fine calumny! Sciolto. A Negro might be vsefull now, although Sh'ad but one eye, and that fix'd on her heele. Altamont. I'le strew vpon thy food the teeth of Snakes, Sciolto. Signior, presume no more vpon a fond Easie nature. I haue beene abstinent Too long. Haste, and with pliant steps present Your wife; Or else I'le assure ye you shall seeke Some other man to Cuckold ye for me. Meruolle. Sciolto, this is barbarous! Altamont. I'le shoot Thy heart with needles, small as splinters of A haire that thou mayst die, and yet not know That thou art kild. Sciolto. I thanke ye (Signior) but We Florentines doe sleepe like Leuorites, With our Eyes open: how ere, I could vouchsafe To shoot you now, and preuent your kindnesse.â Meruolle. Sciolto, hold. If eyther charge doe misse, He that suruiues, shall grinde thy marble heart, Betweene his teethâ Sciolto. I meant not to giue fire. There is a tricke of grauity i'th state Cald Law. Besides, you dead, the children which I chance to get vpon your bucksome wife, I should goe neere to keepe at my owne charge. Altamont. Africa breedes no monster like to thee. Sciolto. I'le to my chamber now, and fortifie There, I remaine (during the pleasure of Your wife) your Tenant (Signior) in fee tayle.â Exit. Altamont. It is a cunning, and promiscuous slaue. This story of Alteza's abstinence, He doth but counterfet, to gull my sight. Meruolle. Had the Diuell himselfe crep't into flesh, And vndertooke this seruice to your wife, She had possessd, the weaker Instrument. He hath in 's Veynes, a most intemperat blood His valour's so renown'd, that all the smooth, The curl'd, and silken Nobles of the Towne, Doe homage to his Sword; and by such Actes As these, he glorifies his truant youth.

Obey Reuenge, and I will follow it, vntill My wealth, and life, are forfeyted to Law. Alta. Hah! wilt thou? O my quickened heart (entomb'd Before within my breast) wilt thou? This, this Then is the direfull night, wherein I'le giue A strict and cruell iustice to Reuenge. Meruolle. This then is the night, where in my bold loue Shall merit me th'eternall name of friend. Alt. Come sweare, sweare now (on this victorious sword) Thou wilt obey th'iniunctions of my wrath, And yet in personall act, not mooue, but when My will appoints a mixture of thy strength. Meruolle. My choice Religion, &amp; the honors of my blood, I heere doe pawne to ratifie the vowâ Meruolle kisses the Hilts. Altamont. Now worke my iniurd spirits, till you make Dull sorrow rise in nimble flame. Anger, Is blood, pow'rd, and perplex'd into a froth, But Mallice is, the wisedome of our wrath. Exeunt. Ent. Florello, Charintha, Alteza, Rossa, Molard. Charintha. Your Lordships letters were of a prompt stile! Florello. This orient Roape is yours, and you must wear't; I sickne els, and grow a villager In Elizium! Charintha. Your bounty choakes my thankes. Alteza. Take it. Afflict me Fame, if ere I knew His parallell; he woes at Neroe's rate. Enter Besognia. Besognia. Madam, ther's a new Dandolo, a new Count, lighted at the Gate, and craues entrance. Florello. That's rare i'faith; haue I a shadow walkes Without leaue o'the Sunne? Alteza. A conspiracie. Florello. Did not Meruolle say, t'would be a month, Ere he ariu'd? Rossa. Be bold and meet your chance. Florello. Stand firme, and stiffely on your sinewes then, Auouch me still, for the true Dandolo. Alteza. Charintha, 'tis some stratagem; but if He Iewells bring, and in a hand as large, And open as yon'easy snypes, thou hast Ill lucke if thou constraine him not to losse. Charintha. I'le smile no longer then these rich sparkles Shine in my Eies. Enter Dandolo. Dandolo. The Lady that is nam'd Charintha heere, must be reueald; for Il'd Exalt her Lippes, and make 'em knowne to mine. Flo: S'light, this is the great Cham. Hearke ye, Signiorâ Charintha. My Lord, I pray afford him leave to speake. Dan. What, is that sawcy Groome? Does he sell Egges? Florello. I'le shew ye my Trade; A poore sword-man, Iâ Alteza. Sir you destroy the quiett of my Howse: He shall haue safety heere, and leaue to speake. Charintha. I'm call'd Charintha Sir; proceed to speech. Dandolo. I'le first doe speciall grace vnto your Lipâ My Penne hath woo'd you oft; but now by stealth Thus single I'm arui'd, a Moone before The time I did prefix. Charintha. I sir, the cause. Dandolo. T'was Winter when I specifi'd the date Of my aproach, and then my blood was cold; But now the spring is come, Things would couple. These (Lady) are very serculare Pearleâ Alteza. I sir, and in such Toyes, she much delights: Allthough her modesty be loath, to make Her fancys knowne. Would you had brought some few To mach'me. Dandolo. Doe you affect'em Lady? Charintha. I reioyce in all the workes of Nature! Dandolo. I am instructed then. Alteza. As how, deare Sir? Dandolo. That I did ill, to leaue my Pearles behind. Alteza. Sister this Hulke, is neither rigged, nor fraught, Charintha. I'le haue no more of him, he is too costiue. Flor. Sir a word. Me thinks you looke, like raw Porke. Dandolo. Has not this house the priuiledge of peace? Florello. Ladyes, this Impostor steales my Titles, And my name, I aske leaue, to punish him. Alteza. Wee'le not protect his crimes, vse your iustice. Florello drawes his Stiletto. Florello. Vnlesse you are an Estridge, Sir, and can Digest steele, coole your lungs, and calmely wayt Th'inquiry I shall vrge. Dandolo. Hence, and be dead! Florello. Molard, reueale how long thou hast bin Pimpe, To the family of the Dandolos? Molard. About some thirty yeeres (Sir.) I'ue procur'd Both time and place, for your good Fathers game, Ere since he was capable of woman. Rossa. He vsd the Trade (Sir) in his infancy. Molard. I scare could walke, when I began't: the first I brought him was my Nurse. Florello. Canst point, at ought He did some two and twenty yeeres agoe? Molard. Distinctly Sir. I know that Gentleman, He was got, on a Tripewife of Lucca. Florello. O th'action of my fathers loynes! Alteza. My lord? Florello. I'm an old Iew at Genealogies. This fellowes descent I know now, and where He tooke's creation too. By chance thus haue I met forty of my Fathers Bastards. Th'are poore, and put me oft to charge. Brother, Welcome.âRossa, giue him a Quardecus. Dandolo. Bid Kings winde silke, and Princes measure oats. Charin. Your trayne of Parasite, Pimpe, Foole and Dwarfe, Speake you at first, to be the true yong Lord. Alteza. Yet th'other has some markes, that doe belong Vnto a Count, o'th last edition too: Dandolo. D'you thinke y'are the Count? Florello. I doe, thinke it, Sir. Dandolo. Thought's free. Alteza. He should be a Venetian, By'th' wit, and policy of his courage. Dan. Beauties, were your hands cleane, they should be kiss'd. Florello. Bold illegitimate. Dandolo. Sir,âyou shall know, No man ere got me, but my owne Father. Exit. Florello. Besognia speake in my behalfe; I'le giue Thee a Pearle then, big as a Pompeon. Besognia. Which, when your Lordship does, Ile returne ye A pointed Diamond, big as a Steeple. Alteza. Y'on thrifty counterfet, has much perplex'd Your seruants wit. Charintha. My Lord. Lets in, and ieere. Florello. Slow method fooles obey. To th'stars aduance His head, who thus resists the power of Chance. Ex. omnes. Enter Scoperta, Sciolto. Scoperta. Like to my Genius he doth mooue about The house. Our soules are surely neere ally'dâ Sciolto. Cals he her, his concubine? By this hand There's not a Prince in all the East, has such Another. This Altamont still gripes 'em In the flanke; he knowes to chuse his cattell. Be thou pleas'd, O yong and wholesome Lady! Scoperta. The Garden (Signior) doth containe more walks, As pensatiue in shade as this. I doe Beseech you, change your path, and leaue me heere. Sciolto. The fumes of spicery? you must not mow.â Holds her in his Armes. Altamont, Meruolle, from aboue. Meruolle. My vowes haue promis'd you the ample truth Of my intelligence. Behold, whom there, Sciolto keepes in amorous whisper. Altamont. Hah, Scoperta! Libid'nous Girle, what makes She with that Horse? Meruolle. Shall I disturbe their speech? Altamont. No, let'em Knit and generate; my words Shall neuer penetrate her Eare vntill I am reueng'd for what my Eyes haue seene. Meruolle. There is a generall tainture in the Sex. Altamont. She is proscrib'd, I'ue fil'd her in the List With those that taste to Night a bitter fate. Away, away. This obiect ruines all My faculties. Exeunt from aboue. Sciolto. I sigh my first salute Was so intempratly perform'd. But O! The iustice of my Starres! My loue is now Reueng'd vpon my lust. With pure chaste flame I Court the Mistresse vnto Altamont; One heere reseru'd for sinfull vse. Stay, stay!â Scoperta. If I am seene, my life is forfeited.â Sciolto. Hast thou not heard my vowes, whose violence And number well might satisfie suspect in way ward Kings. Scoperta. How dare I traficke thus For loue with thee: when thy accompts with Heauen Are yet not cleer'd that lust betrai'd thee to? Sciolto. With what aduice of modesty canst thou Accuse my blood; when in this Mansion th'art Contain'd for the like sinne? Scoperta. Were I well knowne Vnto the qualitie of thy new loue, I would reueale my selfe, and take from thy Beliefe the false opinion of my guilt. Sciolto. If ere I practise impious heate agen, Some long armd Fiend that in the Center dwels Reach at my foot, and pull me into flames. Scoperta. Beare witnesse Immortalitie and Truth That I'm officiall heere but by pretence, My Vaines are cold and chaste as Northerne snow. Sciolto. Thy name, and then my doubts I will forsake? Scoperta. Scoperta is my name. I Sister am To Altamont; not Mistresse of his lust. Sciolto. O dire affinity! my loue is now Alli'd vnto my hate. Yet Altamont Nere merited my wrath. It is the wit The policie of sinne, to hate those men We haue abusd. When first I spi'd the grace And lusture of thy shape; me thought I lou'd, And my sicke heart enform'd me loue was good: Scoperta. And you when I beheld, I said to Heauen, O make but his immortall part like to The Garment Nature clothes it in, and helle Remaine a Type, from whom shall be deriu'd The Prophets, and the Kings that rule the Earth. Sciolto. Her beauties so increase; that they do make My comprehension poore. Scoperta. I should haue vs'd More leasure and nice Art, when I did giue My loue away. Sciolto, O stay, vntill my vowes Affoord a larger warrant of my faithâ Scoperta: Our new society must not be seene. But if thy loue be free from carnall Arts, (Such as the curled Youth of Italy Doe vse) make me thy sudden stealth. Early, (Ere the succeeding Sunne ariue i'th' East) Appeare beneath my Casements view, and I Will follow thee along the spacious World. Exit. Sciolto. Goe noble Maid; wert thou diuided from My reach, by Sheets of Elementall fire, By streames of reeking blood, by purple mists (Which Cannons in their acclamation breath) Or winds (when met to blow each other from The Earth) yet I would pull thee to my Heart. False lust, I take of thee eternall leaueâ Ent. Niente, Alteza. Alteza. Conuey those odors thither, and disperse The costly smoke, about the roome. Niente. I shall. Alteza. Place soft and easie finger'd Lutes, behind The Arras; voyces feminine and yong. And spread the Cowch, with the greene Persian Quilt. Niente. All is prepard. Exit. Sciolto. For what are these design'd? Alteza. I feele a slothfull grudging in my veynes, And therefore meane to solace with a male. Brush thy Beard, and follow me.â Sciolto. Now am I As rascally a sinner, as euer. Alteza. Why comst thou not? Sciolto. O Loue! A little grace. Alteza. Is not thy blood well? Kisse me Sciolto. Sciolto. Shall we be wrap't in curlings intricate? Alteza. We'le haue our artificiall heates, and with our own Panting coole vs to new, and yonger strength. Sciolto. And shall we 'tweene two shady Poplars hang I'th Indian-Net, whose slippery closures may Entagle vs so fast, we n'ere shall be Vntied age. Alteza. We'le grow as in one skin. Sciolto. Yes, much! Not an inch.â Alteza. I want thy meaning. Sciolto. And shall my action more. It mightinesse And state, taught me to fast from flesh; and now, I am well pleas'd to make't perpetuall Lent. Alteza. I like this well. My Male is witty growne. Sciolto. Goe, kneele to your husband, and beg from him Lawfull recreation: my selfe intend To purchase a few Beades, and turne Vot'ry. She'le nere moue hence, 'till I'ue inrag'd her spleene. Alteza. What motiue (Sir) perswades ye, vse me thus? Sciolto. Whyâye are not handsome. Alteza. Trimme prodigie! Scio. Question your Glasse! Your Face was caru'dâout of A Blew Cabidge; and 'tis contracted now To one, oblique Wrinkle. Alteza. Villaine, thou ly'st. Sciolto. Thy aged skull in stead of haire Oregrowne with Mosse, and lookes as if t'had binne, A Thousand yeares entoomb'd. Alteza. Adders, and snakes. Sciolto. Thy sollitary Teeth, in distance stand Like the decayed Arches of a Bridge. Alteza. Better, th'adst binne vnborne. Sciolto. Wilt not yet goe? Thy Fingers are all crook'd, like the Tallans Of a Griffon. Thou walkst on Cloven-feete. Alteza. Hoa! Niente. Sciolto. Thy Bones are pil'd acrosse, Much like the Stickes on a Conjurers fire. Alte. Are my Groomes dead? what hoa! I'le impound ye.â Sciolto pulls out a Case of Pistolls. Sciolto. It must not be. For with these two (of which I meane to rob your armorie) there shall Be passage forc'd broad enough for a Teeme Of Southerne Elephants. Farwell Oister!â Exit. Alte. Where are my Groomes, my slaues? iniurious wolfe. Barke at my precious feature, and thus strew My beautie ore, with infamie and dust? Strike my greene youth, with Epethites of age? My Altamont nere vs'd me thus. He oft Compar'd me to the Starres, m'Eies t'Easterne light, When day smiles at her birth. O! I could curse The giddie iudgement of my blood; that thus Seduc'd me to forsake that Saint, and mix My knowledge with this Deuill. He's fled too, Vntouch'd by my reuenge. Niente, hoa! Enter Altamont. Alta. 'Tis Alteza, I know her sinfull voice,â (She kneeles.) Alteza. O Sir, if anguish, or distresse, can make, An humble heart, behold your Lady now; That shortens thus, her stature, at your feete.â Altamont. What may this forc'd humillitie portend? Alteza. Sciolto (cruell as the windes in March) Hath strooke, my womanhood, with tyranie, And scorne. Can Fate present so large a test, Of your true loue, (both to your selfe, and me) As that you minister reuenge vpon His Life. Goe, and salute his recreant Heart With your bright Steele, and then obedience claime Repleate with fonde Idolatrie, and loue. Altamont. The Fiends are surelie maried too; for there's Noe torment like a Wife! false Alteza. Alteza. So ill I merit charitie: that all My passions argue cunning and pretence. This is a wife hypocrisie, to hide Thy lust, or snare me in some guilt, whereby The Duke may claime my life, and thou receiue More quiet space, t'inioy Sciolto's limmes. Alteza. Those angrie spirits that reside below, In flaming Ouens, are not more cruell in Their enuie, then am I in hate to him. Altamont. So soone, dost steepe him in thy gall, whom thou Hast washt'i'th warme distilments of thy heart. Alteza. If ere I knew him, with more guilt, then what My wishes and my thoughts containd; let wrath Then make me her experiment, to trie How much of paine, mortalitie can beare. Altamont. Thy periur'd attestations cease; for though The howres are few, since first you did conferre, Yet you had both the pregnant thrift, to make The time aduantagious to sinne. Alteza. Expresse, Some mercie in your faith, and heare me speake. Altamont. Keepe thy deniall 'tweene thy blisterd lippes. I fvtterd' thou art dead. Alteza. Loue is no more. Alta. Dost weepe? I sooner thought t'haue seene the Flint Supple as Spunge; th'obdurate Diamond melt At the Glow-wormes pale eie. Alteza. How hath the pride Of Courts misse-led my youth, that you should thinke I'ue lost, all tender complements of grace? Alta. Thou wert a Virgin sweet, so precious in Thy frame, that with the cordage of thy haire Thou mightst haue fetterd Kings. Thy voice has marr'd The beauties of the night. When thou didst sing The quiet stars, would fall asleepe and winke. Thou art all discord now: thy glorie's darke; Thy thinne, and Rosiall blood, is turn'd to Inke. Alteza. I haue outliu'd the helpe of penitence, And benefit of hope. Altamont. Oft haue I sai'd Let's leaue the false, the buisie world and sleepe Beneath our vines; Nature (not cunning) then, Augments our wealth; the dew of heauen is cheape, Nor need we pay for'th Sunnes warme light. If kinde Diuinitie allow t'each humane soule A starre; our issue w'ele increase, vntill The bright and numerous throng be all imploi'd. Alteza. But I am sterill as a wildernesse, My name, is sickenesse to your memorie. Altamont. Witnesse you silent powers, the crime is not Deriu'd from me. T'explaine my innocence, Know, she that heere I housd, t'affront thy pride, Was my chaste sister, not my Concubine. Alteza. Then you are loiall still, t'oth Mariage vow. Altamont. But; she treds the slimie path. Scoperta, Is now thy Riuall in Sciolto's lust. Alteza. All springs from the ambition of my guilt.â Altamont. Although thy penitence be rash, it doth Become thee well, and thou hast quite dissolu'd The stonic corners of my heart. This night I purposd thee a cruell death, but now Rise, and continue mortall stillâI'le lay My mercy on thy Lip, and for it take My last farewellâ. I'le neuer see thee more. Alteza. This is a mercy that confounds the will And strength of all my gratitude. O sad Decree. You haue diuorc'd me from your Eyes. Alta. Two neighboring Lillies whom rude winds disperse 'Mongst restlesse dust, may sooner meet vpon Their stalkes agen, and kisse each other in A second growth, then we our loues renew. Alteza. Take heede (Sir) how you prophecy! For my Humilitie with moist contrition ioyn'd, May hope to wash my leprous staines away. Altamont. O no! my iealousie is growne so sicke, that my Suspect enformes me, it will nere be cur'd. Alteza. I creepe thus to my Toombe, indebted for Your loue, till all the drowsie world shall rise To generall Accompts; and then my want Of earlier gratitude will make my Debt A sinneâ Exit. Altamont. O triuiall propertie of life! Some doe attend the mighty warre, and make Diuinitie their yoake; till for the sport Of Kings th'augment the number of the dead. Some walke in slipprie paths of Court, and feede On silent smiles; the grauitie of mirth. Some trauaile in the search of humane Arts, But knowledge is reseru'd: She sits so high In Cloudes, we cannot reach her with our Eye: Or if with patient steps we to her climbe, Death sayes we cannot reach her with our time. For witherd age ariues, when numbring on Our griefs not yeeres; the tedious space of life We straite accuse. For life is like the spanne Forc'd from a gowtie hand; which, as it gaines Extent, and actiue length, the more it paies. Exit.</field>

May some kinde Saint, weepe o're your Soule vntill With holy dew, he wash this sinne away. Altamont. Thou doest mis-spend thy vestall charitie. I'th sollitary age of Night I come, To finde those Angells that haue businesse now On Earth, in Synod heere with thee: hoping I shall receiue reward for my iust Act. Scoperta. The howers that gaue her opportunitie To erre, were knowne so few; that my beliefe Concludes her guiltlesse of the actuall sinne. Altamont. Before the hindmost part of her vex'd Soule Forsooke her thrilling Lipps, she did confesse, Sciolto had perform'd all circumstance That doth ingender Man. Sciolto too, Confirm'd her attestation as a truth. Scoperta. Be deafe (sweete heauen) to this. Did Sciolto Iterate her foule speech? Altamont. He did, which I, Ore hear'd, and forc'd a passage to his Heart. From its warme Throane, I snatch'd the aking Lumpe; And threw it straight vnto a hungry Fiend. Scoperta. Is he dead too? The Genius of the world Is sicke, all Formes must cease. Altamont. Dost weepe for him? Scoperta. O Sir, should I restraine the flux, my Eies Would drop from their loose Stringes instead of Teares. Altamont. This obsequie, doth make Compassion sinne. Scoperta. O Sciolto. Art thou so early fled, To tast eternitie, and vnknowne fate. Altamont. Stint thy hoarce Dirge, pernicious Whore. I had Some hope, the interuiew that you inioy'd Might be enforc'd by his vnruly strength: But now, I finde it was with thy consent Procur'd, Y'haue struggled in each others lust. All now is euident as light. Scoperta. I bring My innocence, to'th'cleere suruay of Heauen. Altamont. Though dull, to Men of harsh, strict discipline, Yet know, I haue some cunning in my rage. I came to fright this secret from thy Heart: My Hands I did not bath in humane blood, Alteza, and Sciolto are aliue. Sco. This ioy will make my Heart dance in my Breast.â Alta. Sinke into th'Earth, where sorrow dwells. Ere yonâ Dimme Morne shall adde one Howre vnto her Age, Scioltos Sowle shall take a doubtfull flight: It only stai'd to mingle company With thine. My anger was so iust, I Would Not prosecute thy life; vntill my doubts Were cleer'd. Goe, goe, and number o're thy Beades. Scoperta. Is there in all your vaines, no drop (vnmix'd With Gaule) that from our Mother is deriu'd, And so may tempt compassion from your Breast? Altamont. Alteza mournes, as if t'expiate A Nation with her griefe. Hadst thou reueald Such penitence, it might haue softned my Decree. But thou art sowre and sterne of Soule. Scoperta. No mercie, for our Noble Mothers sake? Altamont. My Mother when she lay, a cold paterne for The figure on her Toombe, spent her last breath In praise of thee. Quoth she; For my sake vse Thy Sister well: th'acqaintance that she hath In Heauen is great. I'th blossome of her growth She shall ore'come the Eies of men, and in Her Age, she shall haue skill in Prophecie. But O false lore! Our Mother kind, (whom I A Sybill held) thou now hast proou'd a Witch. Scoperta. I am too weake to force from your beliefe Mistakes so strong. Altamont. Goe pray, the Howres are swift: I'ue purposd thee a pris'ner heere till my Returne.âThis is a sicklie Rhume, and not Compunction in my Eyes.â Scoperta. The last of all My merits shall be calld obedience to Your will: If you doe owe a kindnesse to Your selfe; thinke on Religion and the Lawes. Exit. Altamont. Nature doe thou direct my spleene. The Lawes Are sinfullie contriu'd. Iustice should weigh The present crime, not future inference On Deedes. But now they cheapen blood: 'tis spilt To punish the example, not the guilt. Religion too, on our Italian Earth, Growes like the Cedar big and high; but yeelds No fruit. The abiect race of men she doth Confound with hope, and bids them not obay, T'augment humilitie, but her owne sway. Exit. Enter Meruolle, Sciolto, and three Mutes. Meruolle. Your strength does but intangle ye the more. Sciolto. I'le not be trus'd (Sir) like a Pullet thusâ Meruolle. Leaue nothing that can minister defence. Disarme him of his Pinnes. Sciolto. Pare my nailes too.â Meruolle. You shall be angerd strait, till you bestow The time to bite'm off. Soone as we spi'd You scaling ore the Orchard wall; we guess'd The hopes of your visit. There haue beene snares Lai'd for your feete, ere since you left the House.â Exeunt Meruolle, Mutes, hauing rifled him of his Pistols and his sword. Sciolto. There is some danger in this chance, my dull Heart beates with slow, and ominous leasure.â Scoperta from her windore. Scoperta. Pale Planet shine! It must be he. My Eares Perswade me they oretooke his voice. Sir, Sir!â Sciolto. Hah! Scoperta? A cruell destinie Hath murdred all our ioy. endeuouring an Addressse for stealth of thee, I was surpris'd, Disarmd; euen heere ith presence of my Starres. Scoperta. There's not a Starre in all the Firmament Belongs to vs. Sciolto. O none! Or if there be, Their influence is so weake that at This distance Babes may blow'em out. Sure our Creation we haue tooke vnknowne to Fate. Scoperta. Our loue was of too nimble growth vnlesse Philosophie giue hope, that after death We may conuerse; this is the last of all Our interuiewes. Sciolto. That fatall Prophecie Will shake my Soule from out my flesh; and like Some tame Hermit I shall vnwounded die. Scoperta. The word that's heard abreuiates our discourse And life: the Sand that limits both is falne Into the reach of number now: and I Haue spent with thee the hasty time prefix'd For a deuout imployment of my Beades. The murderers are within. Sciolto. Grimme wild horrour! Hast thou no weapons there that I may vse T'anihilate their vigor and their shape? Scoperta. Vnto thy Lips I'ld throw a kisse; but with The strings of my poore solitary Lute They'ue bound my hands!â Sciolto. O my hot rage! I could Spit fire till I enkindle yonder Groue, Raising a flame that might perplex the Earth, And make'em thinke Heauen had dropp'd a Planet. Scoperta. And I could weepe vntill I quench'd that flame, And drew suspition that a second Flood Was come to drowne mortallitie agen! Sciolto. This sudden eleuation of the Soule; Presageth death: as if it practis'd how To rise, and climbe ere she begins her flight. Scoperta. Whence is that noise? Sciolto. I'le be as calme as are Arabian winds. Scoperta, stay; Vnheard we will conuerse.â Sco. They come, they come, deare loue, for euermore farewell. The Mutes snatch her from the Window. Sciolto. O for the Giant race, to helpe me heaue Those Mountaines vp; that I might burie this Proud Structure and my selfe! Yon burlie Oake (Whose Roots reach hell) I'le manage till I pownd And batter all the Marble into Flowre.â Enter Altamont, Meruolle. Mer. You haue oreheard, what will your knowledge grieue. Altamont. Her Soule is ill prepar'd: Meruolle. I gaue command They should awhile delay her death, lest want Of leasure might destroy her penitence. Altamont. Remaine within the summons of my call: And leaue me heere. I charge thee by thy Vow, And our friendships deare vse, that thou depart. Exit Meruolle. Sciolto. Speake what thou art? Altamont. Some call me Altamont. I'ue seene thee walke armd like a Magazin; With small Artillerie entrench'd: but thou Art fitly now prepar'd for sufferance. Sciolto. Not thy tame sacrifice, but victorie I'le be. For naked as I am I will Resist my death; and since vnfurnish'd to Reuenge, yet I shall trouble thy best strength.â Altamont. Sciolto, though, thou merit trechery, And opposition that, by darkest stealth, May cousen thee, of thy luxurious soule, Yet I will giue thee faire and equall Game. Sciolto. False tyranie! Altamont. Stay. This I will performe, And 'tis to know the rigour of thy might, What wondrous flame and spirits doe possesse Thy spacious Breast. Sciolto. There's relish of intent! Altamont. I'ld learne the prouidence and iustice of My Fate; trie if they'll let me fall before Th'incounter of thy beastiall strength; thou that Augments't thy sinnes t'orecome the memorie Of Heauen: in sillie hope, th'accompts may be Vnwillinglie suruard, because th'are long. Receiue thy Sword.â Sciolto. Miracle of bountie! Altamont. If whilst we struggle in the pride of hope Thou canst so weaken my defence, that I Become disarm'd; thy libertie is gain'd. Sciolto. With solemne penitence I could accuse My crimes 'gainst thee: but griefe's akinne to feare. This great demeanure of thy spleene diuides Th'intent of Gratitude. I know not which T'affoord thee most, my enuie, or my loue. Alta. The moone hath now put on her brightest Robe; My anger too, doth carrie fire enough To light vs to the charge, Guard well thy Heart.â Sciolto. A little respite giue,âMust we needs fight? Altamont. You then would cousen me of my reuenge?â Sciolto. Yet stay!âKnow I doe loue thy Sister well. Alta. Marke (sweet Heauen) with what exalted triumph He boasts the fowle remembrance of his sinne.â Thrusts at him. Sciolto. Stiffe as a columne!â Altamont. Th'Arcadian wrastler told Young Theseus so; but he did yeeld as if His sinnewes had binne made of silke. So fierce?â Sciolto. I'le worke thy strength so low, that Virgins shall Haue power to shakle thee with spinners Thridsâ Altamont. Thus I will bore thy flesh, till thou become Transparant as a Sieveâ Sciolto. This closure hath Intangled vs, let's make another charge? Altamont. Euen thus diuided Billowes part, that they May meete in greater foameâ Sciolto. Wilt thou not bleede? Not yet?âI skirmish with vnbodied Aire. Altamont. Thy guillt betrai's thy hand vnto mistakes, And thus my iniurd Spirits greete thy lifeâ Sciolto. That Wound gapes like to a yawning Giant. Altamont. So hot is thy lasciuious blood, that as I sprinkle it, it scaldes my handsâ Sciolto. I reele Before thy breast, and stumble at a Warrâ Falls. Alta. Thy Sword's my Captiue now. Meruolle, hoa! Sciolto. I haue some courage yet, left in my Teeth, If thou art kinde, come neerer with thy Throateâ Enter Meruolle, Mutes. Altamont. O the Celestiall powers are iust. See there. He bleeds like to a Spring, that borders on The Rubicke Sea, whilst I remaine vntuch'd. Meruolle. Has he not lost the benefit of breath? Alta. Stop all his wounds, and giue him time to spend The rest of's moisture in repentant Tearesâ They binde him with scarfes. Sciolto. My wounds clos'd vp, what meanes this courtesy? Altamont. That thou might'st leasure haue to pray. Be sure (Meruolle.) when's deuotions haue ariu'd Vnto a powerfull length, you strangle him. Sciolio. Can thy young honour stoope to such low flight? Altamont. Vnto resistance equall, I exposd My strength, to try thy courage and my fate. This was my iustice to my selfe: Iustice I'le giue to thee: Thy crimes doe merit death. Sciolto. O sooth my last ambition then. be thou My Executioner. Altamont. Thou art disarm'd, Thy blooming honors now are wither'd on Thy Crest. I should depriue my Anger of Her fame, to be thy actiue opposite. Sciolto: Scoperta, stay. My Soule shall houer straite With thine. Stay for me in the Milky-path. Altamont. Let Italy avowch the iust demeane Of my reuenge. Dull Brittaines know no wrath. Th'vnskillfull youth, that equall Duell giue To him that first incensd the blood; but tempt The curtesie of Fate, such take delight To stroke abuse, pay Iniuries, with right. Meruolle. This way (Sir) leades vnto your Graue. You shall Haue space, to gaine some friendship with the Saintsâ Exeunt Meruolle, Sciolto, Mutes. Altamont. A sudden frost congeales my Heart; I shrinke Like crooked Age; I am vnwieldy on My ioynts, as if my vaines were empty growneâ Opens his Dublet. Wounded. His point has stollne into my Breast. Oh helpe. I'ue yet some vse for life. Th'nice search, I made to know Heaun's secret iustice is Aueng'd. (Bold Earth!) I weepe into the Sea, And sigh t'augment the windes. Repentance is An immateriall Salue, it cures th'vnsound Diseased Soule, but not the Bodies wound. Reeles off, Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act the fift. Scene the first. Enter Niente, Alteza in her Night Gowne. Alteza. A guard vpon my Gates, and haue they there Binne plac'd ere since the first ariuall of The Night? Niente. Meruolle keepes the Keyes, he'le let No seruant be awake about the house. Alteza. The Sunne begins to bath i'th'Mornings Teares! Hast thou Lucio call'd, and bid Pytho mix With him in a sad Song? Niente. I haue Madam. Alteza. No more (Niente) shalt thou seruice doe For me: last night I told thee I had lost My vanitie: that courtly Lady serue Who findes it first. But least thy wants augment Thy Sinnes, my charitie affoords thee thisâ Flings him a Purse. Niente. Well I'm resolu'd to mend, or become worse. Exit. A Song betweene two Boyes. 1 This Lady, ripe, and calme, and fresh, As Easterne Summers are; Must now forsake both Time, and Flesh, T'adde Light to some small Starre. 2 Whilst yet aliue, each Starre decay'd Shee may relieue with Light: But Death leads Beauty to a shade More cold more darke, then Night. 1 The sawcy faith of man doth blind His pride, 'till it conduce To Destine all his abiect kind For some Eternall vse. 2 But aske not Bodies (doom'd to die) To what abode they goe; Since Knowledge is, but sorrowes Spy, It is not safe to know. Enter Meruolle. Meruolle. Howle, howle, vntill you wake the inhabitants Of Graues! till you disquiet all the Spheares; And put harmonious Nature out of tune, Alteza. What meanes this fatall summon, that doth make Amazement cold, as is Iberian Ice. Mer. Great Altamont (your Lord) who still was prompt To curbe th'incitements of your wrath; threw wise Aduantage from his reach, and struggled with The bold Sciolto, in an equall warre. Alteza. Downe holy flame. When Hope doth sicken so, I would not haue the power to prophecy. Meruolle. The surly Lyon, and the testy Bore, Did nere maintaine, resistance with like fierce And ruinous returne of strength: for from Their Eyes such Lightning flew, that Villagers (Whose early labours till'd the Earth) did thinke Rash Phaeton did scourge the fiery Teeme Agen. Sciolto chipp'd, ragged with wounds; Did bleede away his strength. This his false Sword Your Husband bade me prostrate at your feetâ And 'tis the last memoriall of his loue. Alteza. Ambiguous History! He conquerour, Yet this the last memoriall of his loue! Mer. Wise Heauen did mocke your Altamont: for whilst Ore ioy'd with victory, he spies in's Breast A large deepe wound, and thence his Soule tooke flight. Alteza. O my poore Lord! how soone hast thou begunne Thy immortalitie. The hasty Sparke So vpward mounts, and then no more is seene. Meruolle. I'th'last remainder of his dying speech, He briefly told his Testament; which doth Containe imployments sad, and such as you Must actuate strait. To please his Ghost, shew now A little loyaltie and loue, Rise, and Be conducted by my slow steps. I will Enforme your knowledge all that he enioyn'd Alteza. Th'obedience which I scanted to his life, Vnto his memory I'le strictly pay. Meruolle. You haue a losse that doth out-speake complaint! If sweete and pliant discipline of Courts, If feats of mighty Warre, or sober Arts Aduance th'esteeme of humane qualitie; 'Tis fit your Altamont we striue to raise, Aboue the charitie or skill of praise. Enter Florello, Rossa, Molard, in their old habits, Dandolo, Stoccata, Punto, bound. Florello. Who did assist your passage to this walke? Rossa. Meruolle Sir, with whom we vs'd your name. Doe you obserue the Count, and his two leane Ianizaries? Florello. What in captiuity? Rossa. Certaine stratagems (Sir) haue binne leuel'd 'Gainst the Prerogatiue of your life royall. Molard. Ere since the hope of day, they waited your Descent from the Cloyster Bridge: but doubting Their owne courage, and meeting vs disguis'd, Thus in our originall weedes; they would Haue brib'd vs for two Pistolets t'assist The prosecution of your death. Our Grace And strength bound them to their good behauiour. Florello. They walke like Caterpillers on a Leafe.â Takes Dandolo aside. Yeeld me the cause why you contriu'd my death. Dandolo. Good faith (Sir) for no harme. Florello. Giue me a Knife!â They search Dandolo. Rossa. Here is one belong'd to Hans van Genlicke. Florello cuts Dandolos bonds, and gives him the Knife. Florello. Take your selfe solemnly aside and cut Your Throat! do't strait, and neatly too, y'had best. Dandolo. The motion I'd slike, 'tis dangerous. Florello. Haue you three throats, can you reuiue as oft As you are kill'd, to take new punishment, That thus you mutinie 'gainst kind reason? Dandolo. These thousand yeeres't has bin obseru'd, th'eldest Brothers of her house (Sir) could nere endure To cut their Throates. Florello. Tis sit (deare Count) that you Must die; I'm els vniust vnto my selfe. Dandolo. With sapient Arts, we will proiect to saue Th'reputation of your iustice. Florello. As how? Dandolo. I will promulgate I am dead, and both, My Champions heere shall swear't. Stoccata. Wele venture one Commandement to saue another sir. Florello. This cannot satisfy. How ere (Sir Count) If you will patiently accept your death. I'le furnish ye with Guides, for your last iaunt. You Punto, and Stoccata too! No more Of your phylosophie. Fix Brow, to Brow, Knock out, each others Braines, and shew your Lord The way, vnto th'Elizian-Field. Doe it At first encounter too; For I'm in hasteâ Stoccata. Slight Sir, I nere was in Elizium, I. Nor should I finde the way thither, though Signior Argos, lent me Nintie Nine of his Eies. Florello. Then Punto shall be conduct to ye both. Punto. Good Signior, any curtesie but this You may command. You still doe most presume Vpon the calmest, and th'easie Nature. Rossa. They all are forfeittures to th'Law. If you'le Bestow'em but as prisners vnto us, They shall suffer, or giue vs large ransome. Florello. How? a ransome? These Two are poorer then Carthusian-Monkes: leane as a Romish Lent. Slaues, who pretend sicknesse, that they may lie In Hospitalls to steale the Sheets. Achornes They eate, such as Westphalia-Hoggs doe scorne. Rossa. The Count (Sir) will vntie his Strings for 'em. Dandolo. Ransome, I'le giue: for I doe hate to die. Florello. The ransome must Be small. Shuffle 'em together: and pack 'Em hence. I will not heare a sillable Of thankes. Rossa, see'em hors'd for Millaine. Exeunt all but Florello. Enter Charintha to him. Charintha. O dismall change! does your victorious Sword Hang now on aged Belt of Bandeleere? Is your high Plume moulted to a sprigge, small, As if 'twere made o'th wing of a Beetle. Florello. Who can resist the frownes of destiny? My suffrance giues my merits their reward. Charintha. Your speech was wont to be in a more high Exalted Key: lowd as a Gulph! Your heart Was full of ligges, and your feet did wander Euen like Autumns dust. Florello. Affect so much Humilitie as may imploy your thoughts With more compassion on my ru'nous fall. Charintha. I threw on you perpetuall banishment. Florello. I'm come to manifest the sinne of my Disguise, though it proceeded more from hope T'inioy your person then your wealth. Witnesse Each nimble Register of humane Thoughts! Charintha. 'Has got a sweet and powerfull way in speech. Florello. This is my reall Shape, in which I doe Appeare, a thinne and witherd Souldier borne, I'th'later age of warre: When glorie's sicke, And honour triuiall as the spleene of Babes. Charintha. He was not wont to vse this Dialect. Florello. Grant now (thou beautious wealth of Italy) An expiation for my crimes; For know, I would be cleane when I shall dedicate My future vowes to th'absent Altar of Thy Heart: lest I doe loose the vse of my Idolatry; and make repentance sinne. Charintha. Doe all harmonious gifts reside within Such course and humble weedes? Florello. Destroy me not With scorne: I know you Ladies most delight I'th'fraile surface of the body, in name, And guilded pompe, which was the fatall cause I practis'd them on you: Charintha. Y' endeere the worst Of fashion vnto vs, by making it A custome in your selues. If men did not Prouide such follies for our sight, we knew Not where to finde their vse; for they digest Them first, then they become our nourishment. Florello. Vaine men. We alter our creation so With female shapes, that Heauen scarce knowes its stamp And Nature (that distinction still commands T'each Sex) forgets the worke of her owne hands. Charintha. I nere beheld a feature masculine Till now: had you but thus appeard vnto My first suruay, I might haue lou'd in haste, And yet excus'd the rashnesse of my eies. I ginne to feele some danger in my stay. Florello. Ere you depart, a small memoriall from Your hands, I craue, to weare vpon my crest, That it may tempt kinde fate to looke on me, When I in glorious battell striue; and I will absent my selfe for euermore. Charintha. I nothing keepe for such sad vse, as to Depriue me of so sweet a miracle. Florello. Grant my request, or I'le pursue your steps Charintha. If you continue still to beg, I feare My bounty will prooue rash: and I shall giue So much of loue, as you can ne're repay.â Florello. O my auspicious starres! Should I not now Make vse of your good influence, I were Vnworthy of your care.â Enter Meruolle. Meruolle. The choice you make Can nere deserue your chaste and lawfull fire She is Florello of a heart and straine Too insolent for nuptiall happinesse: Florello. Thou hast bin cald my friend. But if thy spleene Continue a dislike of her, I'le blow thee from My memory, and with my chiefest strength I'le punish thy missetakeâ Meruolle. A des'late griefe Will more become thy breast then this proud rage. Thy brother's dead, and his decease caus'd by Her sisters pride. Charintha. My sisters husband dead. Florello. Into my eares thou hast a horror powr'd That hath already stiffened euerie haire On my amazed skull into a Reed. Charintha. Wilt thou neglect to cherish the swift growth Of our new loues? Meruolle. Like to her sister she But counterfeits a passionate esteeme, That thy fond Nature she might tempt beneath Her rule. If Altamont be deare vnto Thy thought, leaue her, and straight attend his Hearse, That in the Chappell waits thy obsequie. Exit. Charintha. Th'inspir'd Needle's not more true vnto The North, the Sunne to his diurnall race, Nor Riuers to the Maine; then I to thee. Florello. Sorrow and loue, my senses doe diuide. If I remayne with thee, then only loue I serue, if with sad fleps, I tread the way Vnto my Brothers Herse, I both obey. Exit. Charin. Thou dost require the skornes which I did throw On thy first loue. My destiny must needs Be tragicke now: since the contracted scope Of all my ioy, rests in diseased hope. Exit. Enter Meruolle, Alteza. Meruolle. Behold the Throne, your Lord commanded me Prepare: and heere you must be pleas'd to sit.â Alteza. Can this aduancement ought refer to your Delight, or to my Lords last Testament? Meruolle. Iustice hath laid her sword within your reach: And you haue power to sheath it so; that where You execute, you may a murder doe, Or sacrifice. Bring the delinquents in. Enter Sciolto, Scoperta, at seuerall dores, each led in, bound and hoodwinkd, by two Mutes. Alteza. Sciolto and Scoperta still aliue? Sciolto. Thy spirit Altamont ascended with The loue of all my chiefest orizons. Meruolle. These two were by your husbands iealousie, And hate, ordaind for death: but ere that we Could actuate his will; his noble breast Receiu'd a wound, that bad him strait prouide For's owne eternity. The last of all His speech, referd them both vnto your power. You may appoint them liue or die: and I'm Oblig'd by vow, to see perform'd what you Command. Alteza. O dire, sinister accident! Meruolle. Your Iewels, and your wealth, I haue pack'd vp, To ease our flight, when we haue finish'd This vsurpation of the Lawes. Let them Inioy their eyes; that they may know their Iudge. The Mutes vnmuffle'em. Scoperta. Hah, Sciolto! Sciolto. Scoperta, O my Girle! Meruolle. Keepe them diuided from each others reach: Sciolto. I thought thy beauties had beene darke and cold, And th'adst (ere this) begun an easie sleepe Within thy silent Graue. Scoperta. And I suppos'd thee fled A Harbenger to Heauen: with purpose to Bespeake my Billet neere to thine. Sciolto. Since this sad night, did blind the drowsie world, They thus haue manacled my strength. They'ue watch'd My hardy violence so tame, that now Each featherd Forrester roosts in my Beard. Scoperta. We cannot (Sir) be mortall long; therefore Receiue a hope our sufferance will cease. Meruolle. Sciolto, now requite the leysure I Haue giuen thy penitence, by rendring straight Vnto the world, how farre thou didst corrupt These Ladies with thy guilt. For know, I still Perswaded Altamont thy lust inioi'd No more, then what concern'd wishes or hope. And I was vsher'd to'th beliefe of this, By knowledge of those secret spies which he Imploy'd to watch your personall remooues, About the House: whose labours euer miss'd Of finding that successe he prophecy'd. Sciolto. I doe confesse m'imagination once Did sinne against them both: but if it ere Extended vnto act; let me lose Heauen. Meruolle. If Altamont were now aliue, he would Permit this vtterance cleere his fayth. Madam, You heare that he Scoperta vindicates By oath; though his owne crime doth carry an Import more euident, and blacke; but yet When you behold his feature, and his youth, Your mercy may conceiue t'were pity that He should so soone depart from time and flesh. Alteza. Sir, you haue skill to know my womanhood Is weake as ignorance, or sleepe. Why should You seat me heere, thus to dispose of Law: That ne're knew any iustice, but reuenge. Meruolle. Your sentence I am bound to execute. Alteza. Haue I not heard you say, my Husband did Ordaine them both for death? 'T would ill become The duty of my knowledge t'alter his Decree. Meruolle. Keepe your intent, I will vsurpe The office of your tongue, Mutes, strangle them. Sciolto. If in thy functions, gentle Nature claime An interest, let vs imbrace, and vse Solemnity, before we doe forsake Each others view. Meruolle. I grant what you Request: make your performance short; whilst I Reueale m'opinions (Lady) to your eare. Sciolto, and Scoperta kneele to each other. Sciolto. O Scoperta! this is the last of all Our busie dreames; what we possesse is but Imaginary now: Thy shadow I, Embrace, not thee: for like to it, thou'lt flie From my enioyment, and no more be seene!â Scoperta. So much of various fate, so soone expres'd Two louers yet nere knew; since simpathy First dwelt on Earth. Sciolto. Ere long we must be cold, Cold, cold my Loue, and wrapp'd in stubborne sheets Of lead: hows'd in a deepe, a gloomy vault; Where no society will mix with vs, But what shall quicken from our tainted limmes. Scoperta. Whilst still ther's noise, and busines in the world; Whilst still the warres grow loud, and battels ioyne; Whilst Kings their Queenes salute in Iuory beds. Sciolto. But O! how many Ages may succeed In Heauens darke Kalender; ere we agen Materiall be, and meet in our warme flesh? Sco. And whether that our soules, when they're prefer'd To taste eternity will euer thinke Vpon the bargaines of our humane loue, Is vnto me a desolate suspence. Sciolto. Phylosophie doth seeme to laugh vpon Our hopes, and wise Diuinity belies Our knowledge, with our Fayth: iealous Nature, Hath lock'd, her secrets in a Cabinet, Which Time nere saw: and he that in it prys Vnto Religion forfeites his bold Eies. Scoperta. Our Reason frights onr Sences to distrust. My Lipps doe begge from thine a Legacieâ Sciolto. O sad acomp. How is my bounty now Exhaust: This is the last I ere shall giueâ Meruolle. Blind them agen and stay their deaths awhile. Madam, your knowledge is allready taught Scoperta's innocence. Sciolto's deed Stands nere your punishment; but distant far From remedy. Marke, his goodly feature. With what magnificence he's built? Besides This Morne his Vnkle too (the wealthiest of Our Senators) is dead, and has bine pleasd T'intitle him his Heire. Alteza. Should I not chide? Meruolle. Thinke how you lou'd him once. He will (to saue His life) discard Scoperta's interest, And marry you: a hapinesse compleate For both Alteza. Hah? Sciolto. Slaues. Stretch now your Cordage out, Pull till my Eies doe starte like Bulletts from my Skull, Murdering where they flieâ Alteza. Hold, hold.âDid my dead Lord bid you performe, what I decree? Meruolle. He did: and I asured it with my Vowes. Alteza. Heare then without resistane of my breath, Sciolto is condemn'd by Law; as knowne The fatall Instrument that did depriue My Lord, of precious life; so he must die. T'were fit my care affected mercie in Scoperta's dome; she's Sister to my Lord: But her sweete innocence doth make her safe. She must remaine among the liuing still; And in her rome, I doe condemne my selfe. For my sterne pride, was the originall cause Of this blacke Tragedy. Kind Sir, as you Esteeme your Vowes, see my edict perform'd: And giue me priuiledge first to endure its wrathâ She descends. Meruolle. This carries wonder in't Scoperta. I'le not resigne these bonds of Death, vnlesse Sciolto share in the compassion tooâ Alteza. Giue me your pardon (gentle Mayd). I haue Depriu'd you of a Brother that deseru'd More Pyramids, then all th'Egiptian Kings. Instead of him, receaue my pray'rs, my wealth. When o're his Hersse you raise a Monument, And fix my Marble-Figure neere to his, Create me weeping.âI shall goe, with so Much sorow, to my Graue, that being dead, My Ashes will haue power to penetrate The Stones. Release this pious Lady and Performe your execution vpon meâ One o'th' Mutes pulls of his Uizard &amp; discouers himselfe to be Altamont. Altamont. Away you dreadfull Ministers of death. The Lawrell Sprigge, the Mirtle nicely wreath'd In Coronets, my Loue deserues; for she Is growne too good for Earth.â Alteza. My Altamont.â She sinkes. Meruolle vnmuffles, and vnbindes Sciolto, and Scoperta, who straight embrace each other. Sciolto. This deceipt brings wonder, great as our ioy. They that diuide vs now, must vse the strength Of swelling floods, and helpe of Thunder tooâ Altamont. Put all thy beauties on agen, and smile At the returne of our long absent loue: My wound is clos'd, and will haue instant cureâ Alteza. The Earth groan'd at my fall, so heauie are My sinnes, so much they did increase my weight. Altamont. Rise gently like a flame, from incense sprung. Meruolle, to appease my iealousie Ordain'd me this disguises that I might heare How in your sentence you behau'd your loue To me: Hadst thou continu'd false, I had Increas'd the anger of thy fate: but now Thou art indeer'd vnto my heart agen.â Alteza. Sir, I haue hope my future loyaltie Will manifest, your mercie well bestow'd.â Altamont. Scoperta, thou'lt excuse the cariage of My doubts, I look'd on thee with th'eies of loue, And loue is still too strict in her suruay.â Scoperta. My memorie would sinne, should it record Ought that might nourish my dislike of you: You made me taste of sorrow, not of wrath. Sciolto. Tis I, that haue most needfull vse of your Kind charitie: forget my errors past, And to oblige my future gratitude Giue Hymen leaue to know your sister for My wife. My Vnkles death hath lent me power Still to maintaine her in such qualitie As shall become my deere respects to you, The greatnesse of her virtue, and her blood. Altamont. Take her, and be as tender of her health, As Heauen hath o're thy wounds; which in their cure Expresse much miracle.âMy ioi's so swell My breast, that I doe finde there's danger in Delight. How bless'd Meruolle are thy Arts? Meruolle. Some Angels care assisted the successe. Enter Charintha, Besognia. Charintha. Not Altamont's returne to life, nor yet Sciolto's and Scoperta's glad repriue Nor all the ioyes in reconcilement of Your loues express'd, can my cold sences please: Florello is vnkinde.â Besognia. The little God Hath lately prick'd her with his baudy shaft. Altamont. Tell me Charintha, is thy loue sincere: Such as i'th simple youth of Nature is Exchang'd by louers with a harmelesse plight? Charintha. It is sincere, as holy Hermits vowes, And true, as their confession at their deaths. Meruolle. Appeare Florello, and receiue thy doome. Enter Florello. Altamont. It was Meruolle's care thus to assure Thy Mistresse reall loue, and constancie Ere thou shouldst giue too much of thine away. But now receiue her from Alteza's hand:â Alteza. Charintha, thy election is so safe Thou neuer wilt repent the iudgement of Thy sight. He cannot be so neere alli'd Vnto the blood of Altamont, but he Must needs participate in virtue too. Charintha. We will embrace each other vntill Age, Depriue our courteous sinewes of extent.â Florello. The gentle Turtle shall direct vs how T'augment our loues; the Eagle to renew Our youth, and we will striue to imitate The crooked Vine in our increase.â Altamont. Ioy, ioy! The firmament is now vnmask'd, and each Of vs, hath found his starre. Florello. My Lou'd Sister, I haue orehear'd the story of your griefs, And from this noble Signior, I must begge A faith indeer'd, the name of Brother too. Sciolto. You shall be precious to my eies as day. Enter Rossa, Molard, fantastickly cloth'd in Dandolo's habit. Molard. The great Dandolo and his Giant whelpes Are mounted on a Mule. Rossa. Naked they ride As scoutes of Tartary they're victual'd with A single egge. Altamont. What are these, walking Drummes? Florel. Th'are such your knowledge shall affect: they must Inioy what I atchieue. Dull men, o'war, The Trophie of my victorie behold, She's mine: bow, and doe homage to her lippe.â Alt. Still thou dost mourn (Alteza) like a Doue. Soft musick: Hearke, hearke how the Roman-Organ seemes T'inuoke the Thracian Lire; the Cymbals of Indea, call Castilian-Cornets foorth, And German-Viols wake the Tuscan Lute: The sacred noise attend, that whilst wee heare, Our soules may dance into each others eare. Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
