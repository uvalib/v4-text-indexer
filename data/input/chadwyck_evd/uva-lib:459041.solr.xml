      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. If in this present thriving age, A poore man may become the Stage; Or if abused Charity And honest minded poverty May please, or if bad men ingrate, And strumpets foule adulterate, So whipt and punisht for their crimes, At once may like and teach the times: We have our nymes, so to your sight: The poore man offers up his mite. Per E. M.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. Enter Lucius and Urania. Luc. Stay fair Urania, thou whose only beautie Would make a desert rich, and force Kings leave Their purple thrones, to come and gaze at thee. Lisander craves thee stay, he that does dote on thee, More then the female on her new faln kid. Ura. You should be still a flatterer by your tongue. Luc. By all my hopes I swear, returne my love But that fair grace it merits, and on my faith A tryal, beyond which the covetous thought Of man nere went, Ile undergoe; And in the Achievement lose my self ere thee. Ura. You overvalue me, were I possest Of so high passions, what you terme love; Alexis equal suit should sooner move Then you, whose birth is all unknown to me. Luc. Ungentle maid, let not thy cruelty Force me despair, he that so oft has song And won the prize for dance and roundelayes; He that has vowed his chast thoughts to thy shrine, Given thee the tender firstlings of his flocks; Who amongst the fairest Lasses of the plains, Chose thee his prize, when at the publick games, He crown'd thee with the wreath, which for his merit In songs and active sports he did inherit, From the deserving swaines; Do not forget My seven years service, which to attain thee yet, Would seem but as one Summers day. Ura. You are too forward. Luc. True love does charge, and that fault lay on me; Oh did thy yeelding heart feel but the fires! Ura. Alas! I feel too much, in modesty forbear Thy violent suit, which breeds suspect; true love being ever mute, When lust findes means to speak. Luc. Command thou cruell maid this heart to break, Which only words give life to. Ura. Nay then I flie thee, or else I shall not knowâ Luc. How to denie me! Oh! speak that word once more. Ura. Will you inforce my love? Luc. Rather then live, stay but and hear my vow. Enter Gisbert. Gisb. Whom ha we here? Lysander and my daughter got so near. Where two such chast brests meet; I need not fear. Some earnest suit belike, were it her love, He merits it; she cannot but approve His worth and person fitter for a State, Then the imployment of so low a fate. Ura. Oh do not wrong me so! Luc. I do appeal to you, who well do know The loyall service: These seven winters past Have stood impartial witnesse, if I have gain'd Least happinesse in ought, but might expresse My constant labour; Have I in excesse My Masters store consum'd, or rob'd his flocks To serve a private riot? have I not born the shock Of sharpest stormes, to drive my weary herd To place of shelter? did the Sun behold The dewie plains before me? or the dayes heat, Force me unto the shade? did the rob'd Females bleat For losse of tender young, whilst sleep possest My sloathfull eye, by ravenous wolves opprest Or time-observing fox? If to make known A gratefull mind, I have so well begun; Oh! think how happy by enjoying thee, The period of my lingering pains would be. Gisb. Thou speakest most true. These tears that speak my love do witnesse it. Ura. You well have told how much we do forget Your labours Sir. For my part I confesse You merit much, nor am I pitilesse. Speak to my Father, he esteems you high, I am only his, if he shall not denie That equal suit, I know not what should want. (Beshrow my tongue, how ready tis to grant) You might in time prevail; Sir only so. Gisb. No word so hard in a maids mouth as No. Luc. Oh! let me stay thee yet to crown this hour With stiles of Happinesse, and by it place In memorie this curse, if ever I embrace Another love, if ever I forget The pity shown me in distresse; then let My fate run backward, let no good attend My present being, other then in the end To make my misery greater, may I obtain Contempt from thence, where most I do affect. Gisb. Thou art to blame to make such deep protests, Ile be thy gage unto my daughter, say Urania Wo't take my word, believe it girle he loves thee; If he prove false, lay all the blame on me. Luc. You oppresse me Sir with this high curtesie. Is't not sufficient that you gave relief Unto my fainting life, when torne with grief? My sad fate-forc'd me hither, which dispossest True virtue of his crown, and low deprest The Kingly Ferdinand, making sad way To the usurping Tyrant, who now sits High in the Sicilian bloud: Is't not enough Your pity gave me being, but to add more Unto my feeble merit? my heart you had before: And beyond that I have not, which with the acknowledgment Of love and duty shall be the annuall rent, Ile make just payment of. Gisb. I credit thee so well, that what is mine, My flocks, lodge, and Urania, all is thine. This day I will possesse thee of them, and retire My weary thoughts from covetous desire Of this uncertain good, and only spend My houres in thanks and payers, that ere my end, So great a good befell me; I tell thee son, I only be thy beadsman, and return On thee and thine as payment for my board; unnumbred blessings. Luc. Alas Sir! you afford Deeds beyond words, which makes me find my self A banquerout ere set up; such interest your love exacts. Enter Cosmo, Licippus, Surdo, Alexis. Gisb. I am sufficient blest injoying such a son; and so in happy time Cosmo and Licippus, they shall be witnesses unto the contract, and my performance. Cosm. Yonder he is boy, and thou canst put on a good fate, she's thine own boy; let me alone to work her father. Surd. I had rather you would work the Daughter; I shall turn tail assoon as ever I come at her. Cosm. Such a bashfull fool was I in my infancy; the boy will spoil all, canst not tell what to say to her? Surd. I think I had best begin soundly with her, tell her I am in good health, I thank her, and so kisse her. Cosm. Whorson asse! thou must kisse her first. Surd. What afore I am in good health? that will show scurvily; pray let me alone, these old men, though they be never so weak, will be doing in the marriage businesse still. Licip. Take courage boy, my tongue shall plead thy smart, Love were no god, should he not crown desert, And just affection. The happinesse of the day, Befall to Gisbert and his lovely daughter. Gisb. The like to good Licippus, your company is rare Sir; You'r welcome both. Licip. I have a suit to you concerns me neer. Gisb. Your are happy then, for you are like to speed. Licip. Your daughter saying so, I were indeed. Behold the miserablest youth that ever Love Made captive yet, whose fight alone would move The hungry Lyonesse to leave her pray, And turn compassionater: if pity ere bore sway Within a female brest, now let it speak And cure the wound, made by those beauteous eyes Which pierc'd his tender heart: in you it lies To make me fatherlesse or happy. Gisb. I would it did, thy griefes were at an end then. Cosm. This strikes me dead. Know Gisbert that the same desire moves him, Has brought me hither, your land adjoyns to mine: For which much suit has past, make but my sonne Your daughters husband, both our states are one, And my death gives him all. Surd. He's half rotten already Sir, besides the chincough, the Usurers disease the gowt, and the heart-burning, the Physitians have given him over long since, because his feeling's gone. Licip. I have no Lands to give, my flocks are all; Which were they more, are his: think of his love. Cosm. My wealth will last, when his vain passion's spent. 'Tis only riches gives the true content. Gisb. Contend no further: to cut off tedious hopes, Know you this day I have assur'd my daughter Unto Lisander. Cosm., Licip. Your servant? Alex. Unequall Heaven! Surd. Unequall Hell, I say, this answer has brought me low enough Ime sure. Ura. Content thyself Alexis, this is the wise mans cure, That any thing which Fate wils he can indure. Alex. Nay I must bar't, and though Fate crosse my will To enjoy thy person, yet I love thee still. Surd. Her husband will not thank you for that, all that I can promise is this, though I cannot dance where I would, Ile shake my heeles at your wedding. Gisb. You shall be liberally, welcome, next morrow is the day, in the mean time Ile passe ore my lands. Whisper Lucius. Cosm. Which should be mine, had I my wishes, farewell, come boy. Gisb. Nay we'l intreat you stay a while, come let's in, From this day to expect my happinesse Ile begin. Ex. Alex. And I my sorrows. Exeunt. Enter Oswell. Alarums [Within] A Ferdinand, a Ferdinand. Osw. A clap of thunder stay the clamorous throats of this rude multitude, these virginall jacks, that skip and make a noise as each hand moves them. Enter 2. Lords, Sands, Ellis. 1. Lord. Oh flie and save your life my Lord, the day is lost! 2. L. Our trecherous troops making with Ferdinand, turn head against your force, to whom the Lords joyning themselves, once more proclaime him King, and give free oath for their fidelity. Be rul'd and flie, the Forests neer will stop their persuit. Osw. Some dismall planet strike you ever mute. You will not second me? Ambo. Twere bootlesse. Osw. I won't curse you; but may you die like pesants, slaves, and cowards: and since there is no remedy, but I must survive, Fortune in spite of thee, Since not, mongst men, a King ore beasts Ile be. Exe. Enter Ferdinand, Unicentio, with a Crown, Lords. A Flourish. Ferd. Take hence that Crown, it was not Soveraignty, But to release you from the Tyranny Of my usurping nephew, made me leave My long retir'd life, and throw my fate Into the doubtfull scale of war, which to make good; Know that by solemn oath I have tyed my self, Never to gird these Temples with a Crown. Ors. Forbid it heaven! Ferd. Let this expresse your loves, you will not move me Beyond my vow; yet that we may not leave you joylesse, We have a son, what want is in his youth, Your best experient wisdomes will supply. Make him your King: besides his right in us, I have procur'd the heir of Sicilie our adjoyning friend, To be his wife. But why with such sad browes And silent gestures do you take our wishes? Uinc. Alas my Lord! your Sonâ Ferd. What makes this sad Apostrophe? My heart misgives me, if my son be dead, Our hopes and joyes with him are buried. Speak, doth he live? Uinc. He lives, Butâ Ferd. But what? Uinc. Alas! he's not himself. Whether his grief, depriv'd of all his friends, Driven to obscurity, and forc'd to live Beneath condition of a subject, borne a Prince; Or some just fate, for our ingrate offence, To rob us of so rich a hope as he did promise, In his fair lineaments, is all unknown, Whilst he that should be ours is not his own; Orecome with strange distraction. Ferd. Distraction is the soul of woe, Poor boy! could not thy father undergoe, The waight of misery without thy help? Oh let me see him yet, and if his heart Give the least life unto his faculties Of sense and knowledge, with Arguments and prayers I will recall his soul, that overprest With melancholy bloud, is bar'd her active use; Like fire supprest for want of heat and flame, Turns to'a choaking vapour; it may be, our presence May give his flame fere vent, and make more light That grosse and earthy load. Uinc. I wish it might. Fortune did never envy nature more, Then in so rich a Cabinet to look so poor, And undervalued spirit. See where he comes. Your violent passion much may wrong him Sir. Enter Sigismond and Catzo. Ferd. Unhappy Ferdinand! beyond this crosse, Thou well might'st dare thy fate. Sigis. Not a step lower, I am in hell already. Catz. If you move him any further he'l turn Devil, claw you horribly, he'l give you his recognizance, the paw, nailes and all. Sigis. More weight on this side, I shall overturn else; Dost thou not see how heavy he hangs here? Catz. Thou art a crooked piece, here's more waight. Sigis. One hundreth pound more and I go right. Catz. Half the mony would make many a Lord in Thessaly go wrong, are you well now? Sigis. I am reasonable well. Catz. And you are reasonable well, that were well indeed. I have a mad hand with you I am sure. Ferd. I want a language to expresse my grief. Poor Sigismond I could dissolve in tears, To make a passage to thy pent up soul. If thou hast any sense look mildly on me. Why dost thou all in fear and terrour gaze Upon thy father thus? Sigis. Help, help, help. Catz. Here, here, what's the matter? Sigis. Has he not eat my bowels out already? Catz. Who do you mean Sir? Sigis. Yonder Hyena. Catz. Yonder hens? Sigis. Dost thou not see his tears? See how cunningly he would seise me in his paw. See how he followes me, shoot, shoot I say. Catz. My powder's damp, it will not off. Ferd. Some God or good man help. Sigis. He comes, he comes, he comes, flie, flie, flie. Ferd. Can none prescribe me comfort? Uinc. May be some musick would allay his passions. Catz. Please him with musick, you may as well catch a hare with a Taber, the very tuning of the fidles would make him starke mad. Ferd. Art thou acquainted with his humours then? Catz. Who I Sir? I have almost lost mine owne wits in his service. Humours call you them? Ile tell you Sir, sometimes he will be dumb two houres together, and then must I be speechlesse as long; then do we two sit making of faces one at another, like a brace of Baboones, or a picture-drawer at his counterfeit; anone he will start up, and make way with his hands, for fear you should run a tilt against his nose, which as he is perswaded, hangs two fathome in his light at least: If any body looks on him he takes it in snuff, and railes at him like a Copper-smith; then must I turn Physitian, and make him believe I pare away two stones at least in collops. Ferd. Didst ever hear him speak of his parentage; Talk of his Father? Catz. Oh Sir! It's a Tragedy if he name his Father once, 'tis no boot for me to stay by it. Ferd. I prethee why? Catz. He sayes they took his crown from him, and banisht him, and then he fals upon me in his fathers right, and so malls me that I am not able to lift up mine hand to mine own crown. I have lost much bloud in your quarrell Sir. Ferd. Poor boy! it was our losse depriv'd thy sense Of her best residence; and me eternally Of joy and comfort. Here friend we will reward thee better, If thou wilt follow him still. Catz. Should he run out of his wits never so far, here be they would drive me after him, tis for these the whole world runs mad now adayes. Exe. Ferd. I prethe leave him not, till we by art, And good mens prayers find out some means to cure him. Yet that we may not seem all buried In our own particular grief, and to the Commons good ingratefull, know we confirme Your ancient priviledge of Senators; Who may determine the affaires of State. Next be it proclaimed that whosoever stand Banisht in our cause, shall be restor'd to honour, And indued with our best love. Uinc. What death shall we inflict upon those Traytors tane in the field upon the Tyrants part? Ferd. Release them freely. This is the difference twixt bad Kings and good, The one through peace doth prosper, th'other with bloud. Proclaime our generall pardon; Kings oft do grant That happinesse to others, which themselves do want. Let each brow put on joy, wee'l only mourn, Our good is yours, our grief shall be our own. Flourish. Ex. Enter Urania as a Bride, Gisbert, Lucius, Cosmo, Licippus, Alexis, Surdo. Dance. Gisb. Be this the saddest day you ere may know. If ever Hymen tyed a happy knot, Or that a parents blessing ere procur'd A good from Heaven, this day a fathers prayers Be powerfull in your joyes. Luc. Our love and duty shall deserve your wishes. Gisb. We cannot doubt it; each man unto his seat. The neighbouring Shepheards to expresse their love Born to my daughter, and to grace the day With harmlesse sports, are making to our lodge, Dance. These notes proclaime themâ Musick and a Dance, which ended What newes Venalcas? Enter Menalcas. Menal. A poast from Court scowring along the plaines, Inquir'd thy lodge, and hearing that my service Belong'd to you, charg'd me on my allegiance Deliver this Proclamation, that with instant speed It might be published. Gisb. My bloud turns cold, I pray heaven all be well! Luc. Did he exchange no other words with thee? Menal. His haste denyed much talk, only in brief He told me, that King Ferdinand by the aide Of the Sicilian Prince was reinthron'd, The Tyrant fled, and those that er'st bewayl'd Their exile fortunes are again restor'd. Gisb. This Proclamation speaks it, which doth by, name give note to Lord Vincentio, late Senator of State, Francisco Ipinolo Jacomo. Luc. Not my name mentioned? Gisb. Lord Lucius. Luc. The same; I thought he had forgotten me. Gisb. With all other Lords, Knights or Gentlemen, that have willingly for our love, or forcibly been constrained to suffer banishment, be forthwith restored with double interest, for all their losses as well in goods as rents, to be received at our Exchequer up, on demand thereof made. Most worthy Prince! Luc. His gratitude best speaks him. Gisb. And this Proclamation doth confirme it, which craves my haste neighbours, you must along with me, all fears are past. This doubles our present joyes, but time doth call, A Tyrants death makes a true festivall. Ex. Luc. This news transport me, Ferdinand restor'd: Which cals me home, and addes unto my name The honour of my Ancestors. Heaven canot give A good equall to this; but I forget my self, This is my wedding day: my wife the daughter To a poor ShepheardâDisgrace unto mine Honour, And perpetuall shame to my posterity! Ura. This newes hath much distemper'd him, tell me love, What means this suddain pale that doth possesse thine eyes with scar? this happy day invites all mirth and triumph, you have not now a thought that can give colour unto discontent. Luc. Forbeare, you are troublesome, your words trouble me. Ura. How, trouble you? you speak not like a lover. Luc. I would I did not, prethee Urania leave me. Ura. Some old renued grief possesseth himâ What ere it be, let me bear equall part, It is my due and duty. I have a heart Beyond my sex to indure calamity. Luc. You will offend. Ura. Rather my soul than thee. Luc. Away then, get you in. Ura. To death shouldst thou command. Grief pressed heart, this day thy tears back keep, Thou'lt finde hereafter time enough to weep. Luc. She's virtuous and fair, why should I leave her then? Her birth is low, that's Fortunes fault, not hers. Besides, she is my wife, I have married her, And shall I leave her now? there is a thing Call'd Conscience would persue me. Dull and abject thought! You fit Lisander a poor shepheards soul, Not Lucius son unto a Senator. I cannot stoop so low, no Ile abjure her sight, Sell both my lodge, and flock to furnish me As is my breeding. Suppose old Gisbert curse, His daughter raile, talke of ingratitude, They beat the aire, great men are above their crimes, Who has a thriving soul must change with times. But for a chapman let me see, Cosmo, His hate to Gisbert will imbrace the bargaine. Enter Cosmo, Surdo. Surd. Father I must leave you and return to the Bride-house again. Cosm. Is there more to be done yet? Surd. It would be ill for the Bride else, I must lend a hand to untrusse her husband, he is a great Lubber, he must to hose go down there, and see where he walks to keep himself in breath for the attempt. Luc. Cosmo the man my thoughts direct me to; I word with you. Surd. Now will he aske him some baudy question, or an other, As how to get such a chopping boy as I am; blesse the example, or being now to set up, what course is best to maintaine a standing table? for his wife comes of a free stock, and will keep open house. Cosm. You make but tryall of me Sir? Luc. By all my hopes they are thine, give me the Crownes and here is the Deed. Cosm. Beyond my expectation. 300 Crowns; there they be Sir. Luc. The Flock and Lodge are thine, take instantly possession. Cosm. Do you not crave this nights forbearance? Luc. Not an hour Sir; necessity will make them ply their work, not follow me. Cos. I am ravisht with the thought on't, my imaginations lost me. Gisberts Lands are mine, there's nought so sweet, As when revenge and thrifty profit meet. Ex. Surd. The old knave commits sin with himself; the Flock and Lodge gone already. I think he means to keep open house in earnest. Luc. This peasants service may much pleasure me. Canst thou be secret Surdo? Surd. As a court Midwife, no Baud like me. Luc. Then know, I am a Lord. Surd. And that may be indeed, for he's sold all. Luc. Take but thy fortunes with me, and Ile raise thee. Say, wot along with me? Surd. Will you swear by your honour you are a Lord? Luc. My Father was no lesse, a Senator. And by the Edict of the restored King That honour's mine, thou shalt be next about me. Surd. Your Tailor will prevent me of that, I had rather come next behind you, for great men cast their sins behind them, and some bribes must needs fall to my share. Are there any wenches where you goe? Luc. Selected beauties, such as Art and Nature contend to make perfect. Surd. Art and Nature they commonly go together indeed; well I well leave my fortunes at home, and run after my destiny abroad. If you prove a Lord, like a fool I may the better follow you. If you gull me like a knave, you shall follow your self, I have been brought up long enough at home, to finde the way back again, that's the best on't. Luc. Never doubt it man, Arcadia farewell: Who parts from a loath'd bed is freed from hell. Exeunt. Enter Cosmo, Gisbert, Urania, Licippus, Alexis. Gisb. Turnd from my home, depriv'd of all my goods, My flocks, my hopes! thou art not honest Cosmoâ Licip. Give them but respite to provide themselves. Cosm. Not a minute. Gisb. Let me but speak with him I am content, he shall sell all. Cosm. You may go seek him, you have little else to spend your, time about, we were too mean to match with your fair daughterâ Your wealthy heir you have advanc'd her nowâ Alex. You are too bitter Cosmo, too pitylesse, Tis basenesse self to trample on distresse. Cosm. You may relieve them Sir, they us'd you well, Were very pitifull to you, twill argue love; And that goes naked too; give me their hates, So I go warm and clad. Gisb. Hard hearted creature! Cosm. Begger slave, pack hence from my door, Ile set my dogs upon thee else, my hounds, I keep them for No other use, if long you stay Ile give you musick to your nuptiall day. Ex. Licip. Unmanly wretch! Alex. In humane monster! Ura. My heart I think would break, Did not mine eyes in stead of words thus speak. Gisb. Ingrate Lisander! Happy wert thou that curedst The wounded Lyon, thou Roman Captive; He did acknowledge thee in thy distresse, And sav'd thy life, yet was he reasonlesse, Had not the faculties of soul to apply The good of pity to himâMy poor Urania, Unhappy childe! tis her grief wounds me more, Then any sorrow my spent age can know. Ura. Alas! I am young Sir, able to undergoe The worst of misery, tis not my losse, But your tears make me weep, pray try me Sir; Do not you mourn, and see with what heart Ile bear Your woes and mine, Ile not so much as weep: Unlesse by chance I hear Lisander nam'd, And then for your sake not mine own Ile blame His much unkindnesse. Ile say you us'd him better, That shall be all my plaint, Sir credit meâ Gisb. Poor girle! How well thou mockest calamity? Alex. Never did grief look with a lovelier face. I could e'en court it now, and hold the maxime, Man is not happy but in miserie. Thou all of virtue, though my fate deny The blest injoying thee, make me thus proud To give thy wants reliefe, our homely Cottage, My Flocks and Lambs are thine. Licip. Both his and mine, Shall pay the duty; by my best hopes I swear, Or may my younglings pine, my Ewes nere beat. Gisb. We give you credit. Alex. Accept them fair ones. Ura. I am more wounded with this curtesie, Then all Lisanders malice. Gisb. Thou shall accept their boons Urania; as for me, I have an other part, to play a Tragedie; Where Justice shall rip up the heart of Cosmo, And lay his trechery open. Ile to the Court, If untill my return you will support My haplesse daughters state. Ambo. Make it not questionable. Gisb. Nay do not weep, here's my hand, Ile not stay long from thee. Ura. You must not seek me here then: No Lisander Where ere thou art, I will or find thee out, Or lose my self, thy sight at least Ile have: Since not thy wife, may I but live thy slave. Licip. Wee'l bring you on your way Sir. Gisb. Your loves oppresse me: Come my daughter, yet We may ere death in joy each other meet. Ura. Too vain a hope. Unhappy Father! Ile do thee thus much right, Thou shalt not double sorrow by my sight. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. II. Thunder. Enter Adelezia. Adelez. Where am I wretched Adelezia? What soile contains thee? You airy powers, What further ill remains behind me? That 'mongst so many dear and worthy lives, As has paid tribute to this fatall night, Mine only stands exempt? had it not been better, The Seas vast wombe had given me buriall, Then the unhallowed bulkes of savage Beasts? And now long-wisht for day, what dost thou bring, But eyes to view my sorrow? Should I hap To meet some passengers, twere to exchange My honour with my fear, and so renew my sorrow, Woe-curing sleep, who is only pitifull, Would shut these casements up, which do admit But sight of grief, then gentle Morpheus I will obey thy arrest, thy leaden mace Doth lie upon me, down poor ill starr'd maid, Thy birth did promise better: but I see Want best discovers Idoll Majestie. Enter Sigismond, Catzo. Sigis. Ho! illo, illo, illo. Catz. The game's not up yet Sir. I think some gelder had a hand in the getting of him, he understands no language but the horn. Sigis. Ile hunt no more then. Cat. You'l hunt a hore then, and that will tame you, when all is done. If a poor man had had this disease it had been whipt out him; but great men may be fools or madmen, and they must be humour'd forsooth. Will you go home again? Now he's as speechlesse, as an unfeed Atturney, not a word for the world. But how now? what creature's this? it should be a woman, for she lies as her mother taught her, she has the common fault of her sex, she sleeps so soundly that a man may do what he will with her. So ho! how the fool gapes, he'l ride her anone, What notâ more yet? What an excellent thing a woman were and she had no tongue? Hillo, illo. They say women must be roughly handled; she turnes up the white of the eye, she should be either a Punck or a Puritan by that. Adelez. Alas! I am betrayed: as you are men, I do conjure you. Catz. Las poor soul! I thought she wanted mans help. Adelez. As you are virtuous, be compassionate Of a distressed maid, Fair Sir to you, My suit's to you, your eye speaks pity. Sigis. A fire burns within me. Catz. What a trecherous wolf's this? I cannot blame him, tis a pretty wench; if I could talke wisely, I might perchance exchange a pretious stone with her. Adelez. Not one poor word of comfort? tell me gentle friend, where am I? Catz. You'r in a wood yet, but for one of your pretious jewels, and some light curtesie besides Ile help you out. Adelez. If wealth will buy' my freedome, you cannot aske Beyond my payment; below yon hanging rock The bodies lie of many Ship-wrackt Gentlemen; Yeeld them but buriall, they'l pay thee liberall hire. Catz. And if they be drown'd, I may take my payment otherwise. I would be loath to take a gallants word now adaies. Are you sure they are dead? Adelez. I am too sad a witnesse to't. Catz. Below yonder, I shall break my neck with haste to be their Executor. Twas told me, hanging or drowning would be my destinie; Ile put my self in fashion and be with you presently. Sigis. She is some Goddesse sure! Adel. What moves this stay? his looks congeal my bloud. Why doest thou kneel? why wring thy hands and weep? Thou doest not know my griefs that they should move compassion in thee? Sigis. Rare, more yet! speak more. Adel. Here's sure distraction, Oh! if thou be'st a man, Art capable of passion, grief, and fear; Leave thy amazed looks, and tell the cause Moves this strange action. Sigis. Art thou a woman? Adel. Yes, a miserable woman. Sigis. Let me embrace thee then, Thou happy anchor of my better being. Adel. Defend me heaven! Sigis. Why dost thou flee me, to whom thy charmed breath Hath given a second soul, thy language hath exhal'd All clouds whose foggy mists did captivate My freer sense. I am thy creature, Faire, Depriv'd of thee, I lose that vitall aire In which I only breathe, I must, I will injoy thee. I know thou mad'st me not, now to destroy me. Adel. Keep thy unchast hands off, thou barbarous creature. Were they thy unchast thoughts, that mov'd thy lust To speechless extasie? You powers above more just, Preserve my Virgin flame, from the pollution Of this insensuall creature. Keep off I say. Sigis. I would, should all the Devils in hell say nay. Let me but draw in thy delicious breath: But touch those lips of thine. Adel. âRather to death Would I give up my life. If there be a power That guards distressed chastity, Oh! hear me. Sigis. Didst thou but know my thoughts, thou wudst not fear me. Upon my knees I do conjure thee stay. Adel. To my escape some better power make way, See he persues me, some god or good man aid me. Ex. Sigis. If not my words, let sighes and teares perswade thee. Ex. Enter Alexis. Alex. Thy search is vain Alexis, unkind Urania, Thy presence was too great a good for me, Long to enjoy, nor will I ere return; But like a banisht man ever inhabit These solitary woods, depriv'd of thee, Ile flie all others, as thy love doth me. Adel. Help, help, help. Within Alex. What eccho beats mine ears? is there no place But sorrow finds a passage to it? Adel. Help, help. Enter Adellizia Sigismund. Alex. It is a womans voice, speak once again, And gain thy freedome, whosoere thou art. Adell. Here, here, save a poor maids honour. Sigis. Thou wrongst my just thought much; I seek for love. Alex. Rather thy beastfull lust, for which Receive this punishment, foul monster lie thou there. Adell. Oh save his life! I do conjure you Sir. Alex. Thou art too pitifull, rise beauteous maide, Remove all thoughts of fear, let me perswade; I have been virtuous, thou unfortunate. Adell. This thy humanity orewhelmes my joy, And quite confounds the power of my minde. Alex. The blisse of thine own thoughts is my reward: I am happy yet to guard so fair a dame. Catz. Soho! illo, illo, illo. Within. Alex. But hark! the following noise of some persuers; It may be they are known by thee. Adell. Tis not in use for grief to have companions, My woe knowes no partakers. Alex. Ile be thy partner then: Wilt thou give credit to my loyall brest? Adell. As unto heaven; true virtue knowes no lust. Alex. Follow me then, though mean may be thy fare, Content and safety, may give thee ample share. Exeunt. Sigis. It was a thunderbold, you have the ods of me, you are above me, sure I had mauld you else: but where is Europa? see where she swims away upon a buls back; my kingdom for a boat, for a muscle boat; lay more sailes on; the envious winde! blow, whirle into a mountain, Ile after her; sowze, I come I come. Ex. Enter Madam Gulman, Urania disguised. Gulm. Your breeding I perceive hath been in the Countrey then? Ura. It has been plain and honest. Gulm. It makes no matter, now thou art a Gentlewoman, my daughter's a Gentlewoman, and though I say it, as good a servants Mistresse as any in all Thessalie, you shall do no worse then she doth her self, nay she shall spare it out of her own belly, rather then thou shall want it. Can you handle your needle? Ura. True stitch, or so. Gulm. You will be past that shortly, your Mistresse will set you a new example, and though I say it, she has laid her hand to as many good pieces, as most Ladies in the Kingdome; at this instant she is about a piece of work for the Lord that is with her, she'l make him a pair of hangers ere she has done. Ura. Beshrew her fingers: what might you call his name? Gilm. His name is Lucius, this day he is to be made a Senator; has been seven years in the warres amongst the Turks, and killed Jove knows how many, and now he swears bloudily he loves none but my daughter. Ura. A bloudy oath indeed, my heart doth make it good, His cruelty will cost mine and an old mans blood. Gulm. Why do you sigh so? are you in love? Ura. I have small cause forsooth. Gulm. It's an unprofitable disease indeed, it gives that to one would serve many, and those that are men of fashion too. You shall have gallant upon gallant here, none of your thirteen pence halfpenny jacks; if you have grace you may rise, for the worst here comes a horse back. Ura. Has my Mistresse more Sutors then this Lucius here? Gulm. We had weak doings else. Good shopkeepers have wares of all sorts, some for shew, and some for fashion; and yet to speak truth, he doth well for both, his countenance keeps the painted staffe in awe, and saves us many a fair bribe; besides my daughter makes him come off at her pleasure, and yet it is not one winde can keep her Mill a going: one of these dayes she'l turne him off to thee; if thou please her well, thou mayest have him in reversion. Ura. I should have, had I my right, but tis too great a happinesse for me so much unworthy; Lisander a poor shepheard was my husband, and would he had been so still; forgive me Lucius, tis my love that wrongs thee, and here he comes; And had I but mine own, Those happy Armes might 'bout my waste be throwne. Enter Lucius and Flavia. Luc. I know no reason for't, and yet my heart Seems to proclaime some sadnesse, I would This day were ore. Flav. I could be more merry now; and yet I have had a heavy night on't too. Ura. Would I had eas'd you of your burthen. Flav. How melancholy you are Sir? I believe you have an other Love, hie ho! the very thought of it. Luc. I prethee do not wrong my faith so much; by my hopes, till I beheld thy face, I knew not what love was, by this I did not. Ura. Thou art perjured then, and yet thy vow's nothing, Tis a false book thou tak'st thine oath on. Gulm. Tis early morning Sir, walke one turne more in the back side, stirring will get you a stomach. Do you begin to weep already? we shall have a day on't then; no sooner is your back turned, but here is sigh upon sigh, her heart goes in her pulses, and beats pit a pat, pit a pat, till the teares trickle down again, never was young Gentlewoman so overborne with affection, heaven give her good on't; if you should leave her in the suds nowâ Luc. Time shall be false to truth first: come I shall be angry with you, come prethee smile upon me Love. Ura. I could shed tears, might they be so tain off. Enter Surdo. Surd. Soho! Mris. Gullman I have been knocking below till my heartsake; Where is my Lord? Luc. Your businesse Sir. Surd. My businesse, nay that's done Sir, the Senat has staid for you any time this half hour. Flav. Thou wrong'st me friend to rob me of my Love. Sweet Lucius thou shalt not part from me. Luc. My honour doth inforce me to it, by this diamond I will not stay a minute longer then necessity constrains me. Gulm. This Gentleman protests most nakedly, upon such an oath Ile believe any man. Surd. By this French crown, Ile be with that new gentlewoman, Will you believe me now? Gulm. Ile talk with you upon the premises. Surd. This is the arrantest band in Christendome, my Master like a Gull lies tiring upon a Ringtail, whilst I am at varietie of fresh tame sowle: Tis the bravest life; since I turn'd Courtier I do nothing but drink, whore and sleep. Will you be going Sir? Flav. You shall hear her sing first, in troth you shall. Luc. Have you a good voice Castadora? Ura. A sad voice Sir. Flav. Ile ha' you sing a merry song, I am a maid and I cannot mend it. Ura. I have no variety, I can sing but one song. Luc. Let's have that, What's the subject? Ura. Tis of a haplesse shepheardesse forsaken by her false Lover. Luc. Tis too sad, I do not like it. Ura. I would you did not, I might sing merrily then. Surd. This wench has been with a Conjurer I hold my life. She knowes all my Lords knavery. Luc. This day is ominous I fear, farewell, till night we part; No hell but in an absent Lovers heart. Ex. Ura. That proves thy crueltie, That sufferest mine so long in hell to be. Gulm. Cannot you perswade him? Surd. He's troubled with the great mans ill, cannot indure to hear of his faults, you'l remember me, I have left a familiar token with youâThe French thing you wot on. Ex. Gulm. Be confident; is he gone? Flav. Hang him Gull! I am as weary of him as of a feaver: but see here come Jaspero my dearest Lover. Ura. Monster of women! Enter Jaspero. Jas. I cannot stay with you beauty, I only come to give you the maidenhead of my new clothes, you are for the show. Flav. The new upstart Lord would ha' provided me a standing, but I took an order with him before he went. Gulm. We can ha' standings there without his providing, I ha' been put in ere now in the lobby, when my betters have stood bare before me, and have had many a sweet bit out of the pasterie, and out of the pantry too; they are as kind menâ Jasp. I believe Madam, you are welcome. Fair, what Gentlewoman's this? Gulm. A poor Virgin wants help, heaven send it her. Jasp. When shal's come to the breaking up of this Giblet pie? When will thy love be out of the way? Flav. Hang him Hornpipe, a small mist puts out his eyes. When you will. Gulm. Though he should see, what cannot we perswade? Man was asleep, when womans brain was made. Ex. Ura. Immodest strainer of womanhood! Did ever Poor Creature fall upon so hard fortune? What misery can belong to her, hath seen Her aged Father turn'd to beggery, Laden with contempt, his silver haires prest down With the same weight? Life I am weary of thee, Ile flatter thee no longer, my Lucius hand Shall force thee from me; if he deny this good By violent hand, to shed my hated blood, A word of his shall do't; Ile only hear him speak Once more, deny'd, I know my heart will break. Ex. Enter Gisbert. Gisb. This is the Court sure, whose eminence proclaimes Fair Justice seat is here, who sits on high, That no man suspect partiality. Here in rich purple clad, her followers goe Each man for his desert, and not for show. The oppressed poor mans advocate, whose unfeed tongues Turn willing Orators, retort the wrongs Upon the oppressors head. Cosmo shall finde The bribing sorcerers picture Justice blinde; She has eyes to see his crueltie, he shall perceive Poor men have friends though they be far off. Ile leave a president behind for't, and see where some of them appear: I must not yet give interruption to them, their brains are Enter Jaspero, Licurgo. Troubled about businesse of state, the Kingdomes good, Whilst other sleep secure, these spend their blood, Out watch the tedious night, only to gain Titles of honour, hardly worth the pain. Jasp. I shall never sleep till I find out for which of his good parts this Lucius was made a Senator. Licur. Thou art in the high way to madnesse then; which of his good parts! dost make a Gentleman Usher of him? Jasp. I have examined my self, and my glasse tels me, I have as simple a chin, speak as few languages, can wear perfum'd boots, and begger my Taylor, keep a whore, be lousie; be as impudent, jeer at that I understand not, make antick faces; and lie as damnably, all as forwardâ Licur. Backward in the way of preferment. Ile tell thee, it may be he broake his shin, and having a good Surgeon kept not his chamber above three dayes, and so his valour raised him, or took a box on the ear, swore he would put it up, and so his patience raised him: some unknown virtue or other did it. Jasp. Nay that's certain, but we neglect the shew. Gisb. Their serious talke is ended. Most honoured Sir, I have a suit to you. Jasp. Let me have the preferring, I am your first man. Licur. By this hand Ile share with thee, speak it old man. Gisb. Did not I tell you, here are true States-men, How they contend in virtue? even ambitious To do poor men good? This paper speaks my right. Licur. Canst read Jaspero? a monopoly, transportation or concealment. Gisb. Tis a particular grief Sir. Jasp. Of some particular Corporation. Gisb. That lies as heavie on the bearers shoulders. Licur. Some suit from porters hall, belike not worth begging. Jasp. Beggery it self, the petition of Gisbert and his daughter dispossest of a cottage, two roods of land, and a sheep-walke by the leud practise ofâDost take us for Justices Clerks? Gisb. The friends of Justice Sir. Jasp. So are they, their Mistresse could not share with them else, take your humble complaining and pack hence, the Porter will give you a marke to be known by, and know men of our rank a little better else. Gisb. My cause is just, and I poor, pray will you read my Petition. Jasp. We had rather thy cause were wrong, and thou rich. Do we look as though we lived by relieving the poor? You horson Gull, you shepheard! Licur. How the slave smels of tar and hogs grease! Ex. Gisb. These are not virtuous sure, I am mistaken; Justice has not her being here, and yet I had directions hither, Ile make a farther tryall. Enter Catzo gallant. Catz. Pray Jove the sight be not past yet, this suit will beare me out, I am in fashion from the bever downward, I would be loath to have the repulse. Gisb. Most worthy Sir. Catz. I know none of that name. If the Gent. Usher might but see my roses, it would prick him forward to my admittance. Gisb. How's this? a word with you, do you know where I might finde Justice? Catx. Justice! what's that? a man or a woman? Gisb. The poor mans friend Sir, she that never yet did take or give tribute. Catz. What dost thou look for her so neer the Porters lodge? Honest friend be rul'd by me, return the way thou camest. Here's no place for such fellowes. Gisb. Oh hear my reply Sir! Catz. Should I be but seen to confer with a fellow of his rank, it were enough to call my wit in question, and that were simple, very simple in sooth. Ex. Gisb. Monstrous! all man is lost in't, what an asse have I been? Who all this while have thought that which should make Up perfect man had been within him: how ignorant Were our fathers, that spent so many tedious hours In Art, that by so many pretious acts did strive to Attain those types of honour and regard, Which now a Taylor and ten yards of silk, Will throw upon a manâI can but pity them, sillie, weak Men they clad in russet gray! By deeds sought titles, these have a nearer way, To what? to hell; Damnation follow them. Happy Nuseus now I well perceive, Thou by experience notes sage not in vain Foretell till the change of times, when to the plain From these tempestuous hils thou didst retire. I have forgot how ost thou wouldst be moan Astrea's flight to heaven; that Justice gone, Extortion took her seat, attended on By Pride and Ignorance. Oh I could curse! Dissolve to tears, yet laugh too, for this sight Affordeth both. Who is't would not smile To see an Ideot proud? as garnisht posts, whose house Is but a sink, meer rottenlesse within: This silly asse, what good within himself Can make him proud? his silkes are none of his, He only bears them as a Camell treasure. Should the poor worme take from him what is hers, How naked were he? nay how pitifull; Oh! twould distract A temperate virtue to behold his piebald jawes Sit on the Eagles pearch; these airie bubbles, Out sides, waering more wealth beneath their knees, Then would relieve the want of twenty worthyee Yet distressed souls. Here comes another of them, Has, if mine eyes deceive me notâ Enter Lucio, Surdo. Luc. Now Surdo, are all things fit? Surd. They are all ready Sir, your men I mean. Mary how fit, you may imagine, considering most of them weare borrowed cloathes, there was never Senator I think had halfe so many Attendants. Luc. Why prethee, thy reason? Surd. There's never a man of yours but has a follower or two of his own, for fear they should run away with their borrowed goods, you shall have them at a beck, they are watcht for stealing. Gisb. Tis he, my son Lisander, heart thou art opprest with joy, I could e'en blame my unadvised thoughts, that ere were moved with losse of my estate, which with his merit has thus advanc'd him; I, he has too much virtue in him to want preferment long. Surd. My honour'd Lord, the Senate doth attend you. Enter one. Luc. Ile instantly attend them: hart! Gisbert this way! Gis. Stay worthy Son, mine eyes are drown'd in joy, Lisander stay, old Gisbert speaks to thee. Luc. To me! thou art mistaken, give the poor man an almes. Surd. Have you any single money about you? give me six pence, here's a groat, we that carry the purse must profit by it. Gisb. Is not your name Lisander? this Surdo? did not you marry Urania my daughter? Surd. How? he marry your daughter? marry fough. Luc. I wonder such are suffered to approach so neer the Court; Command the officers to void him. Gisb. Oh inhuman wretch! I will persue the Villain. Luc. Nay, then you'l be too troublesome. Surd. Foot! have you no more with then to think a Lord will acknowledge you for his father? were you my father, it should be upon good tearmes ere I would take acquaintance on you. Gisb. Leave me your faculties of reason, virtue thou art a begger, I will hate thy company. There's none but fools and knaves that happy be. Canst thou deny thy name? didst not thou come From the Arcadian plaines? Surd. What an asse is this? we came from a baudy house, stay but a little, Ile shew thee the way thither, we'l be very jovial, I command all the under whores; thou shalt go upon the ticket with her. Gisb. Insufferable! man cannot bear it. Surd. It will try your back, that's certain; marry then you shall have your Eringo rootes, Crabs guts, Doves pizles, fryed Clary, and Lambes stones that shallâ Girb. Thou wilt provoke me slave. Surd. Oh! beyond all measure; what is it makes threescore venture upon a girle of sixteen? stay but a little till the Senate rise, and thou shalt to't old lad; make it not strange, if it be a sin, tis of a good standing, ever since Adam. Ile be for thee presently. Ex. Gisb. Dissolve thou seat of life, that dost not yeeld one good that's Worthy life, so many deaths each hour pursue us. Thou dastard earth, why doest thou on thy aged shoulders bear More sorrowes yet, when as one groan would end thy misery, And ours? what ill canst thou expect Beyond this age of sin? would'st thou behold more bribery? Dost think thou canst sustain more? More sighs of wronged innocents, whose tears Have eaten into thy bowels? Dost thou desire To bring forth more ingratefull monsters yet; Whose sighs have turn'd all charity to flint? Hast thou no place of refuge left? yes, the Senate, They will relieve thee Gisbert, these are men Bred of superfluous humour, the sound bloud Lies at the heart, thy wrongs once understood By those impartiall Judges, thy woes are cur'd; They are the Kingdomes props, by whom secur'd The harmelesse Lamb lies by the ravenous Wolfe, And smiles to see him grin. Oh! pardon me You honourable men that sway this monarchie, As the first Mover doth the generall globe, In equall motion: I will recant mine errour, And to posterity speak your partless doomes, For their base minds are sway'd by bribes and blood. The world shall know great men are just and good. Ex.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. III. Cornets for a dum shew. Enter Officers with robes fitting a Senator, Lucius between Leonardo and Silleus, the rest attendant, two Officers. 1. Offic. Bear back, roome for the Senate, bear back, you are too forward. I do not speak to you Sir, make roome for the Gentleman in the imbroydered doublet. Enter Catzo. Catz. My hose are sutable to it, I assure you Sir. Gisb. I beseech you Sir, my entrance much concerns me. 1. Offic. What's that to me? Dost think I stand here for nothing? Gisb. You must pardon my ignorance, here's all I haveâ 1. Off. Nay then you will in Sir. Enter Gisbert. Gisb. I swear he stands not there for nothing, the heaven of justice must needs be seated there, here is such hard entrance. Enter Lucius, Leonardo, Vincentio, Silleus, Glisco. 2 Offic. What means this rude companion? stand back. Gisb. This Officer must have somewhat too, but I have never an Asper left, I shall never be able to purchase an other entrance, if I do not speak. 2. Off. This fellow dotes. Gisb. Not of thy company. Justice grave sirs, let me have justice. Luc. Death! Gisbert here! Gisb. If ever you'l deserve the prayers of good men, or have Your names preserv'd to happy memory. When soules corrupted rot, give a free ear To mine inhumane wrongs. 2. Off. Fellow, stand back. Vinc. Officer forbear, speak freely aged man. Luc. Some Planet strike him dead, this fellow's mad, Talks of a daughter lost, has had some hinderance by her; And being crost, will rail at any man he meets. Gisb. Most shamelesse impudence! Leon. He's far gone indeed, twere fit he had some Physick given him, or carried to the house of the Insani. Silleus. His age doth make him past recovery. Poor man! who brought him hither? Gisb. How's this? do they take me for a mad man? Vinc. I see no sign of such distemperance. Speak aged father, Who has done thee wrong? Gisb. That Monster Lisander, that ingratefull wretch. Sil. Ha, ha, ha, alas good old man! Vin. Lisander! thy passion blinds thee sure, here's none of that name. Gisb. Is not your name Lisander? did not you marry my daughter? Luc. I told you as much before, a place more private, or lesse free of aire, would fit him better. Leon. See how his eyes turn, how fearfully he gazes on us; It is a deep Lunacie. Glisco. As I am a States-man, I pity him. Gisb. It may be I am mad, have lost my senses, I must confesse I have not been mine own man this 20. days. Glisc. It seems no lesse. Gisb. Yet let me tell you Sir, were you Lisander, as you look very like him, I could unfold a tale, that had you harts of flintâ Vinc. His words me thinks speak no distraction: Say aged Father, if thy griefes be curable, Thou shalt find comfort. Gisb. Nay it makes no matter, I shall but trouble you. I finde my sorrowes have orecome me, and oreturn'd my brain, And ide be very loathâ Luc. To trouble us: Poor man go home; thou but disturb'st thy soul with the renewing of some ancient grief. Gisb. Look on me once again, and tell me if I be mad, have lost the faculties of a reasonable man, as sight or hearing. Glisc. Lost all as I am truly virtuous. Vinc. You wrong your judgement. Gisb. Ile be tryed by you Sir, you which do seem to have some spark of man left, Ile trust your eyes, compassion speaks in them, Am I my self a knowing creature able to distinguish? Vinc. Thou art, discourage not thy self, how ever grief Transports thee, thou art as free from Lunacy as my self. Luc. Vexation! Gisb. Then he that sits in purple there's a villaine. Luc. Now by mine honour Ile pluck thy tongue out. Vinc. This violence proves some guilt. Gisb. Nay let him come, has only left me life, And that I am weary of, hear let him take it. The groaning earth, the silent aire shall speak In thundering Accents my inhumane wrongs. Vinc. Leave circumstance, name the particulars. Gisb. I must give larger vent first, they have too long possest This narrow seat. Know honour'd Sir his name, I cannot name him, once did bear Lisanders, name, But that (as all his deeds) may well be counterfeit. Some ten years since, laden with grief and sorrow, Made to my lodge, though poor, yet happyer farre Then those whose terrets much more lofty are. It was that day made fatall by the losse Of virtuous Ferdinand. Luc. Some Planet strike him dead. Gisb. His eyes and silent gesture spake his griefs, No tedious way was made to his relief. It was sufficient, that his wants were known, True charity makes others wants their own. I gave him safe repose, no gold prevail'd, Though much was offer'd, to have his life betrai'd. Unto my danghters love; poor maid! pardon my tears! She did deserveâ Luc. You wrong your worthy ears, To heare a mad man thus. Vinc. You wrong your self, By all my Ancestors I do suspectâ Luc. Your wisdome, do you not? Vinc. Rather thy honesty. Glisc. You are too forward Vincentio. Vinc. What, in relieving misery? would you had no greater crimes. Father proceed. Gisb. Nay I was almost at an end, beyond that ill Fortune cannot extend a curse; I mean the saddest nuptiall betwixt My child and him, with whom he had all, And more he could not have. To expresse him in a word, No sooner happy sate our King restor'd, But he ingratefull not only left his too Too miserable wife, but to expresse The hatefull soul of base ingratitude, Sold both our house and flocks; nor did he blush To expose those limbs to hatefull beggerie, That fed and cloth'd his naked miserie. Vinc. A tale as sad as true. Luc. Peace howling Pesant! My merit's known to stand above deprave Of such a Bedlam tongue. For you that please to sit, And hear my honour scandaliz'd, know time May turn his glasse, and give me cause to smile And laugh as much at you. Ex. Gisb. Do you then fear him? If Justice self be aw'd, no marvell then, If strange oppression prey on weaker men. Leon. You are too violent old man, a while give way. Gisb. Most willingly. Vinc. To such foul crimes we may allow no favour. Glisc. You do forget, he's high in birth and place. Vinc. His highnesse will add so much more honour Unto the justice of the punishment. Leon. Who strikes a Lion must be sure strike home, Lest ayming at his life, he lose his owne. Such game I like not: old man come near; May I advise thee, thou shouldst leave thy suit. Gisb. First I will leave my life. Leon. Nay, since you are so peremptory, know, Thy accusation's idle, thou bring'st no proofe. Gisb. No proofe! Leon. His worth is known, thy age and poverty Do move thy tongue beyond a certainty. Howsoever his desert, for so mean a fact, Does plead sufficient pardon, were the act More capitall; men of your ranks Must put up injuries and render thanks. Ex. Gisb. Good, very good! Sil. He tels you true, it may be our own case, Shall we upon complaint of men so base, Be questioned? no, Cedars are Cedars still; The valley must not dare to climbe the hill. Poor men must suffer, rich do what they will. Ex. Gisb. Better and better! Glisc. I admire their judgements that with mine just aim'd; And I with them, as men blest in one fate: Should I dissent from them, I were not wise in State. Ex. Gisb. Best of all! Vinc. Poor man I pity thee! but cannot help: Thou hadst best go home, thy sorrowes make thee sad, The good that I can do thee, is this, the world is bad. Ex. Gisb. Have you now said? I hope you'l give me leave, At least to answer you. Ha! all gone, tis not possible. Not possible? This is the Senate house, The poor mans audience chamber, it cannot be. Thou shalt have justice sure, see with what silence They attend thy griefes: He that erst put thee back How quietly he stands to give thee passage. He lies that sayes this judgment seat's not free, And open unto justice, yes Gisbert thou shalt have justice. Most worthy Senators, this paper speaks my grief, An old mans grief, an old mans crying griefes. See with what greedy eyes they read it? tush! Gisbert, thou shall have right man, Equity It self sits here, This place admits no favour, Bribe nor fear. He ascends the State. As Leon.] What's here? Gisbert craves justice against a Peer, a Senator, the man's distracted sure. As Sil.] Far gone indeed, see how his eyes do turn, How fearfully he gazes on us, poor man! Come hither, alas it were more fit, Thou wert in Bedlam there to learn more wit. As Glisc.] As I am just, I pity him, lead him hence, A shepheard sue a Lord! Poor innocent, What mak'st with us? thou art out of the way sure, we Sit here about affaires more profitable. As Vinc.] But not more just, now by my bloud you wrong The man, tis not distemperance but grief that moves His tongue, his cause is just, and he shall findeâ As Leon.] Your weaknesse; shall he not? do you forget he's low And base, his adversary great, old man be rul'd by me And leave us, yet if thou needs wo't stay know this. Thy accusations were they nere so true, We must respect his eminence, not you. Poor men are born to wrongs, low are their ranks, The more they are trod upon, the more they must give thanks. As Sil.] He tels you true, it may be our own case, should one Great theese condemn an other? it were base. Let them steal on: Cedars, are Cedars still, Poor men must suffer, rich do what they will. As Glisc.] I admire thy wisdome, that with mine just aim'd; And I with them, as men blest in one fate; should I Dissent from them, I were not wise in State. As Vinc.] Poor man! I pity thee, but cannot help, Thou hadst best go home, or stay here and run mad; The good that I can do thee, is this, the world is bad. You empty pated Judges, painted Idols Whose souls are purpler then the robes you wear. Whose ear's more deaf unto the poor mans cries, Then hel's to pity. I will go home, And every step my soul shall utter a curse; Which meeting with the repercussive earth Shall beat yon marble vault and wake the Gods; Who with a leaden hand hold justice back, From falling on the impious heads of men. And when mine failes Uranias tongue shall help, Lysanders name will make her eloquent In exclamations; the day thus spent With jealousie we'l watch the wanton night, No sooner shall a star dart forth his light Through her Eben vail, but from our eyes A dauney vapour like a mist shall rise, To choake his fires, and fright the partiall watch. The day we'l spend in curses, the night we'l weep Till tears glew down our eyes, to mock sad sleep. Ex. Enter Gisbert again. Enter Ferdinand, Licurgo, Vincentio, &amp;c. Ferd. Move us no more, having seen the fort and taken Order for those Souldiers, we'l choose a wife for Lucius, To equall him in birth, and place him as our Lieutenant Over them, till this be done we'l take no sleep. How now, from whence these letters? Horn within. Enter Post. Post. From Sicily. Ferd. How fares your King Valerio? Post. In perfect health. These Letters crave perusall with all speed. Ferd. Our leasure serves us not, till soon Vincentio We'l defer the reading of them; and with the morning Sun Let our Secretary dispatch him with an answer. Post. I do beseech your Majesty. Ferd. Be not so importunate, forbear till morn. Ex. Post. Tis news I fear, though late, will come too soon. Enter Sigismond, Catzo. Catz. What a mad Gentleman's this? whither will he lead me? Sigis. I take you are a magician can blinde mens eyes with apparitions, and turn your self into divers strange shapes and proportions. Catz. Who told him of my purpose troe? Sigis. I will put you to your purgations Sir, I will have you show me a sort of Virgins about the age of 20. honest. Catz. Tis impossible, Art cannot find them out I assure you. Sigis. I will have them poor too: then thou shalt find me 20. honest Lawyers that are rich. Catz. They are not in nature neither. Sigis. And they shall marry with those Virgins, and so we may chance to have an honest breed of them; I am a good Commonwealths man, I will have it so, do not defer it, art not a conjurer? Catz. A poor Scholar Sir, and that's next door to beggery: They are cousin germanes. Sigis. I am mistaken, thou art a Philosopher, pick me a sallet for my dinner, and by that time Ile be with you in Philosophy. Catz. Pick you a sallet! I had as live pick rushes. I cannot tell how to pick a sallet, not I. Who comes here? another mad man? hel's broke loose sure, I were best to run away. Enter Gisbert. Gisb. Tis done in dismall characters, how black it looks! Especially towards the latter end, where they did Make away my daughter, now let me see what shape Would fit me best. Catz. An Asses shape if your Advocate hath left you worth your ears. Gisb. Rare! I ha't, into a night ravens, it will smite with my Revenge, for when the evening growes late, these prying Statesmen fit in their closets plotting some innocents fall, which to their net may bring a golden draught: my wings shall beat their casements open, and with horrid clamors and Croakes affright their guilty souls, Oh! twill be rare, To see those made others make themselves despaire. Sigis. Do 'ye heare Sir? before we enter into disputation, Ile put a case of State upon you, I know you are a Politician. Gisb. A word with you Sir, Is this a Senator? Sigis. Dost make a doubt on't? is he not cloth'd in purple, shalt hear him give his charge. Grave father take your seat. Catz. This world will not last long sure, Learning is so sodainly advanced. Sigis. Now Sir? have you any businesse with this Learned man? Gisb. Speciall businesse! Does not your Lordship know Gisbert? Catz. That name is known to me. Gisb. And his daughters too, is't not? Catz. He had a daughter. Gisb. But thou hast murdered her. Plucks him down. Sigis. Oh! save the Physitian, learning's overthrown else. Catz. Hold Sir, hold, I am no Senator, I am a foolosopher. Gisb. A Philosopher, then rise Aristark asse. Catz. You have made a starke asse of me I am sure. Gisb. Are you a Philosopher too? Sigis. Keep off I shall break in pieces else, I am made all of glasse; Canst thou not see quite thorow me? Gisb. I took him for a Senator, a man of State, those we call great ones. Catz. You have made a little one of me, I might have kept me out of your clawes like a coxcombe as I was, if I had known you would ha played horse play with me. Sigis. But since you are a Philosopher, Ile put you to your books. Catz. Not I Sir, I was put to that afore: and since it will not save me, Ile be hang'd ere I trust to't any more: There's a Gentleman of your own humours, he'l dispute like a Puritan, without all sense or reason. Gisb. Then this Learned man; shall be Moderator, nay sit down, if you prove not a Philosopher, Ile make an asse of you presently. Sigis. I would be loath to crack, the least touch makes a flaw in me. Gisb. Thus I oppose you Philosopher, If justice be corpus simplex, a simple body, as Philosophy defines it, how comes it that she desires composition, and deals not simply according to her nature, without a working element be joyn'd with her? Cat. This Question's able to put ten Constables and their bils to silence, yet Ile answer you Sir. Iustice is a simple body, now Sir, the more simple the body is, the better cloathing it requires; and great reason, for the most part she weares loose garments, and now being to cut her coat out of a broad cloth, she had not need of slender comings in Sir. Sigis. But Justice is blind Sir. Catz. True Sir! and therefore subject to go astray; and therefore she had need have the more help to put her in the way. Gisb. Ile have another bout with you Philosopher. Catz. A few more bouts will make me turn Fencer and run away, tis the safest ward when all is done. Gisb. Have at you Sir. Thus I oppose you Mr. Philosopher, If heavy bodies that are composed of earth, descend downward, how comes it, that so many fools and Usurers, rise upward? Catz. As I am honest man, I shall never be able to answer him. Gisb. I ha' put you to't, make no demurs, lest I joyne issue with you. Catz. Hold, hold, he'l beat that into me, which he wants himself. Gisb. Are you ready? Catz. You are I am sure else, but Ile answer you. The reason that fools and Usurers rise upward, is this, Fortune's a whore, now your whore is a light creature you know, and of her self turnes upward; now this whore doating upon none but fools and Usurers, with a violent hand bears them along with her. Gisb. Why had not this whore Fortune been carted then? Cat. Because she has the Usurer to her friend, and buyes it out Sir. Gisb. Let me imbrace thee, most wise Lucullus; Give Learning place. Catz. Alas! you ha' beat out his bottome, did he not tell you, he was all glasse. We shall never joynt him together again. Sigis. I finde my self in two, hold! or I shall fall in pieces. Gisb. What bad fortune had I to break so rare a piece of workmanship? Enter Ferdinand, Vincentio, Glisco, Silleus. Ferd. Fair Adellezia shipwrackt, let each eye drown'd in tears, Participate her losse. Command through out our Land An universall day of sorrow; haplesse maid! Not thine, but my impartiall fate had sway. In thy untimely object; behold him that confirmes it. My all of grief and joy, poor boy could I Recover with my lives losse, thy well being; But thou art all incurable. Sigis. True Esculapius, I am. Catz. You must bear with him, he is no wiser then he should be. He thinks he is glasse, and with this fall broke in a 1000 pieces. Ferd. Let him into our palace, henceforth we'l not expose him To experiment of art, our self will be his keeper. His sight at least will do a true friends part, And banish flattering comfort from my heart. What aged man is that in whom grief looks So pale? It makes us fearfull to behold him. Gisb. It is the King of birds sure, how all crouch to him; and do him willing homage. Fe d. Speak, what art thou? Gisb. Though old dread Soveraign, yet vouchsafe him hearing, Will lay such black deeds ope will banish night For ever from her vail, or loath the light. Peruse this paper. Enter Lucius. Ferd. Alas poor man! my soul doth pity him. See here the Villain comes, Lord Lucius We purpose to prefer you to a wife Of our election. Luc. I do beseech your grace to pardon me, I have vow'd to live a single life. Ferd. You have vow'd to live a single Villain! Peace monstrous wretch, I hardly check my tears, Unhappy King that must trust others ears! No marvell Heaven so many ills down hurl, Nought but injustice can destroy the world. Corrupted Judges, the States most dangerous foes, They smile and strike, there's no fence for their blowes. Vengeance and rage! I could forget my being, And be your executioner my self. Gisb. This creature speaks an other language. Sil. We humbly do confesse our crimes, and on Our knees intreat your highnesse pardon. Ferd. Pardon! may nay own sins ne'r be remitted then. Ingrateful Monster! Canst thou deny this schedule? Recall thy self old man, I am thy Prince, And will revenge thy wrong. Gisb. Are you a man Sir? Fdrd. As thou art. Speak Villain. Canst thou disprove this too just accusation? Luc. I cannot; only for the murther, As I shall hope for mercy, I am free. Gisb. Lives my Urania then! Luc. I left her neer the Lodge, Whither in grief she madeâ Ferd. Abhorred viper, that could'st behold her smart, Who with her own cur'd thine, I loth thy sight; And here deprive thee of all dignity Due from thy Ancestors, thy Land we seise, And give thee only four dayes space, to find Urania out. One hour defer'd, our Kingly word is past, Thou for her losse, shalt tast untimely death. So thrust him forth our presence. Ex. Lucius. Gisb. True Prince indeed! Pardon, renowned King, my much forgetfulnesse: Oh! let some pinacle, made a God, whose height May reach to heaven, bear thy name stampt In golden characters, untoucht by envious time. Ferd. Rise much wrong'd man, you worst, but first in place With him that did so easily second thy false doome, We banish both of you into the woods, As most unworthy mans society. Thou shalt injoy the place and honour Of our chief Justice; infer no denyall. What want is in thy births preheminence, Thou hast in virtue and in innocence. So lead away, thy daughter being not dead, Thy joy ore' flowes, all sorrow's cancelled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. IV. Enter Lucius, Gulman, Flavia, Surdo, Urania. Flav. Perjur'd slave! hast a wife? could'st think lechery would have a better end? out of my doors seducing Varlet. Luc. Hear me but speak. Gull. Out upon thee penurious Rascall! my flesh shakes to be at thee, thou hast made little better then a whore of my daughter. Surd. And a baud of your Ladyship. Gull. Wer't not for modesties sake I would have my peny worths out of thy flesh. Flav. The hangman will rid us of that care; beggerly slave! Why dost not laugh at him Castadora? Ura. I could shed tears for thee poor Lucius. Though many moneths thou couldst indure my grief, One day seems long till I yeeld thee relief. Luc. Is then all love and pity banished? In lieu then of the good thou stand'st possest by me, grant me but one nights being in thy house, thou see'st tis late, and I unfurnished of means and credit. Flav. Would one night save thy life, restore thy name and thy degraded honour, I would not grant it, for know I hate thee more; then all thy wealth inforc'd me love before. Surd. You are no whore? Flav. So let's in if longer you stay here, I will provide you of a Harbinger. Gull. You shall have a lodging at the cost of the Parish if you stay a little longer. Exeunt. Surd. Baud, blood-sucker Canniball. Ura. Afflicted man! I that for comfort sought thy company, could now afford some pity unto thee. Ex. Luc. Ill destined Lucius, but in vain's complaint, then tell me Surdo, what cure canst thou apply unto my miseries? Surd. Such as the world gives to men in distresse. As I am a Courtier I must leave you. Luc. How leave me? Surd. Would you not have me follow the example of my betters? I promised you to serve you only as you were a Lord; and so I have done, and will till I see you at the gallowes, and thither you shall have followers enough. Luc. Wilt thou not help to find my wife out then? Surd. Ile see what I can do. Oyes! did any manner of man take up a woman child, of the age of 22. lost for want of a husband, let them look into her mark, and if they finde her a Virgin bring her to the Hangman. Luc. Ingratefull groom, doest mock my misery? Surd. Are you such an asse to think she'l be found to save you from Hanging, that have left her swimming all this while? she has more hope of her widowhood then so; the old saying is, Marry a widow whose husband was hanged, and then she cannot upbraid you with them; Ile see if I can find her and put it in practice. Farewell, I will look to hear from you by the next new Ballad; pray Jove it be to a good tune, and come off bravely to the life, t'will be to your own comfort and credit of your followers, to see and hear so many bear parts in your death. Ex. Luc. Contemn'd and left of all! where are my parasites now? Honours shadowes that seem to move with an obsequious right, as if they were inseperably tyed unto our persons. When the truth is, their motion is from the sun, which being done once, we are left naked. Why should I blame this world then, Since means and honour sway the greatest men? For give me one that ere lov'd virtue poore, Shew me an Userer charitable, or an honest whore. I cannot Flavia with just cause condemn thee. It is the leaden waight of time that moves thy hate, And with a violent hand doth force thy soul To this observing world, for well thou knowest, Wert thou as chast and fair as the Greekish dame, Fam'd for her twice ten winters constancie, And hadst no foil to put thy virtues off, Thou might'st spin out thy daies to get thee food, Or turn base prostitute, and sell thy blood, At every comers price. Enter Urania. Ura. Where might I find this most unhappy man! Whose grief will not permit my jealous soul To trust him with the night: Oh! did he know How much beyond my self I prize his love; Twould move him to afford me pity, if not love. But see where suiting with his fortunes, on the ground He has cast himself, could we our fates foreknow, He had kept the happy mean, not Iain so low. My honour'd Lord why with so hard an eye, Do you behold your friends? Luc. Thou doest forget thy self, I am poor, and poverty, When none else will do't, makes all men fly. Ura. You much mistake me Sir, I am Castadora One that did never fawn on your prosperity; Yet cannot choose but love you, whose sympathy Speaks mine own woes: pray Sir accept this. Gives him gold. Luc. O! tell me true, Did not Flavias hand commit this charge to thee? Ura. Can you yet think she loves you Sir, whose hate Has reacht a height so far above her sex? Or is your weaknesse such to love her still? Luc. My constancy is such I ever shall. Alas! tis not her hate but fear to suffer in my disgrace, tis her want that moves her thus to my injury. Ura. These are the effects Of lust whose seat is in the bloud and sway'd by that As by the nourishing food, whereas love Having her residence only in the soul; And setling her affections once is not more mov'd by Any outward accident then are our thoughts by Captiving our bodies. Luc. Thou speakest beyond a woman. Ura. You have a wife Sir, or it seems you had one, Though by your much ingratitude undone. Compare these two, the strumpet and your wife, One seeks your death, the other gives you life. Luc. Thy words do trouble me, I am not well. Ura. Alas! how can you Sir, you are in hell? Tyed to the flames of an inchanting Harlot. Pardon me Sir, if beyond modesty, I presse a strangers ear, in whom I see My own sad fate, answer me one demand. Luc. Freely speak what ere it be. Ura. What one particular Most moves your love unto this creature? Luc. Her beauty which alone I would injoy. Ura. But never did. What pleasure has the Userer in seeing Anothers gold he cannot hord? or what Particular happinesse gives that which every day, Man for a Pistollet may make purchase on. O! think that willingly you would not wear The garments of another; nor lay your body In the common bed of a suspected Harlot. Think how much more you should abhor to mix Your blood with an adulterate curtezan; Wash in a leprous bath; a strumpets womb; And she your love is such another. Luc. Impossible! Ura. How if I make it apparent? Luc. I should die willingly, and think my tortures Too gentle for so foule a change. Ura. Attend me then, On the ground. Here are three duckets all the store is left me. What will you say, if for this gold you obtain, To lie with her this night. Luc. As I am Lucius, whom she so contemns. Ura. The same; Imbrace her lustfull wast, receive As much content as ever, yet in the morn, She shall reject your sight with loathed scorn. Luc. Make me so happy in my misery; My soul shall blesse thee. Ura. And if I do not may I lose my hopes; Come saddest soul, your doubts Ile not prolong, Thus honest wives avenge their husbands wrong. Enter Alexis, Adellezia, A Table. Alex. How like you fair this solitary life? Adell. As shipwrackt men the shore, or prisoners liberty. I never thought a good in life to be, Untill I found it here. Alex. This your content doth bring into my minde Those dayes that Cavus lived upon his plain, Unhappy Courtier, yet a happy swain. Me thinks I now do hear his well-tun'd pipe That drew the covetous ear of listning shepheards To hear him chant his passed misery. But I forget my self and stay too long, Our supper's yet to kill, and night drawes on. Adell. You need not make such hast, our store's not spent; Here's enough left: small viands serve content. Alex. But time cals forth, and promise liberall prey. I must begone, and if my horn you hear, Think I have sped. I promise thee rich cheer. Ex. Adell. Take your own way, why now I thank thee fate, Thou hast made a double mends for my lost state. In stead of honours and a marriage bed, To chast thoughts and content my soul is wed. Vain world I hate the stead of thy flattery; Heaven is my Book, virtue my company. Enter Oswell. Osw. Where should I seek out death, or find some means To stop the gaping jawes of famine, I could on equall Termes incounter with a Tigre, whose rage hath Suck't her dry. Ingratefull hunger that feeds upon His bowels, whose want denies him sustenance. Thou wound'st me more then all mine enemies. But See some Angel, yet her face speaks her woman. Meal! Should Devils guard it, thus would I reach and eat. Adel. Amazement to my soul, how greedily he feeds, twas want sure forc'd him hither, if so I am glad our poverty supplies him: Oh! did he know who with a licorish palat feeds to surfet, how many empty souls would be made happy in what he vomits; or felt one dayes torture of piercing hunger, with what temperate hand he would injoy these natures, medicines! food is no other. Osw. So I feel my self in reasonable temper now. But I forget my happinesse, here's a better course. Pardon me beauty, that I scaped so fair a mark as your lips, but now Ile make amends. Adel. What mean you Sir? Osw. Nay I know you will plead chastity, tis the common fault of your sex, you have been some under vessell, waiting woman, and faln into the Butlers hands, had an untimely broaching, and now are laid aside here for ripening. Adel. What do you take me for? Osw. A woman made for the use of man. Adel. I am a haplesse woman, Wrackt at Sea, and cast upon this shoar. Osw. Did not I tell you, ye had a leak; Come, come, leave circumstance, thou seest I am mortall, and thou art flesh and bloud, born to fall, and therefore let's down together; nay, nay, do not resist. Adel. Not resist? know brutish creature, I am too well provided to lose mine honour, so long as this frail flesh which we call life can ransome it. Villain keep off! chast Lucrece shall be my president. Osw. So I would have her, lie with Tarquin first, and then kill thy self after if thou hast a minde to't. Lucretia she was the first cunning whore that ever made a fool of a Cuckold, when she saw the morning, her night villany was discovered, to prevent the fire fell upon the sword; but since you'l needs be stabbed, Ile help you. Takes her knife. Adel. Prevented! if there be a power that helps Distrest chastity, rescue a spotlesse maid. Osw. She should be a maide, she's so unwilling to her businesse. But since you force me to enter into bonds with you, Ile make you seal to the Articles of agreement, ere I have done with you. Adell. Help, help, if I have deserv'd thine anger Heaven, Oh let it fall at once! Let one death expiate. Osw. She should be a sinner, death's so often in her mouth. What's here? Epistles? To the high &amp; mighty Prince Ferdinand. From whence? Yours Valerio of Sicily. We have sent you here our Letter. daughterâFortune, thou hast return'd amends for all my wrongs. Revenge, I wonot keep thee fasting one minute longer. Horn within. Adel. Heaven thou art just; now Monster doe thy worst, Osw. Beyond Hels torture; What Villaine blows that Horn? Adell. A vertuous Woodman, who with his followers. Osw. His followers? Nay then I am trapt, the bellowing Oxe that with his grones did fright the Earth carryed not half that torture in't, I shall dissolve through fear. Adell. The basenesse of thy guilt, unworthy wretch! Yet know how worthy merit stands; I pity thee, Distract thy self no further, by my chast bloud, I'le set thee free, so henceforth to this Wood thou wilt become a stranger. Osw. Hell swallow me else. Adell. I'le take your oath, unbind me first, then fall To your meat, with as good stomach as before. Enter Alexis, Leonardo, Sileus. Alex. Recall your spirits, grief-afflicted men. Time may restore those honours he hath borrowed. 'Tis but to try how you will bear it; nor shall I think it my least happinesse to have been Author of your change. Amb. Your vertuous arguments have overcome us. Alex. Now Lady I have brought you: Ha, what stranger's that? Adell. A miserable almost famisht man, He hardly could speak well when he came in, His body was so weak, his mind so ill. Osw. Shee'l spoyl all; I was a poor souldier in these wars, and have been in some reputation with our King. I have been troublesome to this Gentlewoman: I would fain bee unmmanerly, having filled my belly, be out of this Forrest. Adell. His guilt admits no trust, pray give him free conduct, I'le force your stay, since we have met thus happily. Alex. We will not part till supper, no place I see But gives us means to practice charitie. What wants in fare, your welcome shall supply, Make good my promise Lady. Adell. With a willing heart. If you knew all, you'd say I had reason for't. Ex. Osw. Hell choke you with your Supper. But may these two be, Sileus and Leonardo, that helpt to disthrone me? What new turn of State has forc'd them hither? Leo. I'le question him, it may be he can resolve us, if Oswell lives; Me thought I heard thee name thy dependence on the banisht King. Osw. I did hang on him as others did, as long as he had nap, you ha my meaning; came you not from Court? Sil. Against our wils; for know, we are banisht thence by unmindful Ferdinand, who for one bad, has quite forgot the many goods he still enjoys by us. Osw. I know't too well; Hell take you for't. Leo. Leaving our merits; Let it suffice He turn'd us down, that by our aid did did rise. Can you resolve Sir, if Oswell live? Osw. And if I could, think'st I would betray him! I'de suffer first. Leo. Protest no further, there's none here means him lesse good then your self. Osw. This fals out to my wish; a word with you Gentleman: suppose Oswell lived, and by your aid might repossesse his Diadem, would you prove honest? Amb. As Heaven to virtue! Osw. Then know I am the man, and to regain my Crown want only but your assistance. Amb. Command us as your Vassals. Osw. As our friends, and those that shall have equall shares with us. First then know this woman is Valerius his daughter. Leo. The woman of this cave. Osw. The same, sent hither to be matcht with Sigismond, and shipwrackt in her passage, fell upon this shore. Amb. A most strange accident. Osw. 'Tis her disgrace or death must raise our hopes. Leo. How is this to be made possible? Osw. Thus; my self not taking notice of her birth, will charge her to the State for companying in lustful action with this woodman, which seconded by you, will seem so clear, that being returned with shame, or here with death paying her forfeiture, her father that overwhelm'd our state in just revenge bears us up agen. Amb. A most unheard of Villany. Osw. Doe you demur upon't? Amb. We only want disguise, that and 'tis done. Osw. Here's gold to furnish you, this night I'le raise the neighbouring Village to apprehend 'um, make you hence and fail not to morrow to meet me in the Senate. Leo. Our lives be gag'd, if we one minute misse, Be this the last day of our happinesse. Ex. Osw. Your wishes be your own. Thou Queen of Fate, Forbear thy restlesse motion but one hour, Revenge is mine, Oswel's above thy power. Ex.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. V. Enter Lucius and Urania. Ura. Have I not kept my promise? did you not finde her base and mercenary? Luc. She is as all the world is mercenary, Except thy self chast vertuous Castadora. Enter Gulman, Flavia. Gull. But art sure he has no more gold? Fla. Not an Asper; but I'le try, come you dissembling wanton, thou dost not know how I love thee, hast ne'r a toy, a Ring, nor Jewel left? Luc. Pardon sweet Flavia, I ha not any, yet such is thy impulsive and attracting beauty, I can as well live without free ayr, as be debarred thy presence. Flav. How's this, my presence? Gull. The fellow's desperate, he would fain be hang'd at our dore, we want no sign; good Wine needs no bush, we have custome enough already. Luc. Thou dost but put this trick on me to try me, Thy last nights love shew'd thy affection to me. Flav. Affection! marry fohâI would not endure such another nights torment; Pack hence, or call an Officer. Luc. Thy worst foul Monster! I will not leave this place, Wast thou as high in malice as in lust, Here will I end my life, to prove Heaven just. Ura. Let me intreat you for this day forbear him. Gull. Out upon thee puritanical filth, we may thank thee for this, that preferst the Cart before the Horse; turn Procurer, before th'art past procreation. Flav. This young Bawd will confound all our doings. I shall set you in with a mischief. Ura. Thou hast done thy worst already, and my miseries in spite of thee shall end, this hower doth gain My Lucius love, or kils me with disdain. Gull. You will not go then? Luc. Not stir from hence. Gull. Look to the door daughter while I go for the Constable; Wouldst make a vaulting schoole of our house? thou maist hang thy self and thou wilt, but not here neither, yet if thou hast a mind to't, Ile go fetch a Hangman. Ex. Flav. She tels you true; this in a circle followes, Fools and knaves nourish us, and we the gallowes. Ex. Luc. Monsters in nature! my apprehensive thoughts Present a thousand tortures, the least of which Wounds more, then the bloudiest Executioner. Thou tell-tale conscience, cease thy bauling clamors, Here's that shall stop thy throat, yet now I think on't, My poor Urania dyed a lingring death; Each thought whereof like to a greedy Vulture, Enter Urania. Feeds on my tyred heart. Thou discontented ghost, Where ere thou wandrest stay thy restlesse course. Behold thy most ingratefull husbands bloud, Siting the thirsty earth. And thus Urania, I boldly come to thee. Ura. And thou art welcome, as heaven to miserie. Mistake me not, I am Urania, she that in this shape, persued thy wished sight, attending this blest hour. Luc. Urania! shame and my joyes at once confound me. Canst thou forgive my wrongs? Ura. As freely as I wish forgivenesse of my sins, say but thou lovest me, I have double interest for my sorrow. Luc. Love thee! I am thy vassall, my joyes come on so fast, I fear they are too violent to last. Enter Flavia. Flav. I think here comes a Surferare to remove you How's this, Lucius and my maid so familiar? impudent strumpet, Ile tear the flesh off thy face. Luc. Perpetuall hag, take this for't. Flav. Devils and furies! I am slain. Ura. Alas! what hast thou done? Luc. Nothing but what my life must answer, flie my Urania, Though thou forgav'st me, heaven will not; By what thou hold'st most dear, abandon me. Ura. No, Should the racks and tortures presently Be fixt unto my limbs. Luc. Thou add'st to my afflictions, if prayers Will not prevail, Ile flie and leave thee. Ura. Rather of life then of this sight bereave me; Know I will accuse my self as chiefest actor in this Murther, If thou makest motion to go without me. Enter Gullman, Constable and Officer. Gull. See, this is the flesh flie I told you of, open that box, you may swear lawfully you took no bribe of me, Constable do your office, Oh my daughter, Constable, my daughter! Const. How came this murther? Luc. This bloudy hand did do it. Ura. Set on by me. Gul. Let me tear her eyes out. Luc. By all that may be sworn by, she is free; the act is only mine. Gull. Most unnaturall villain to thrust a woman into the body thus unmanly, I will have both your blouds for't. Ura. Mine, he is innocent. Luc. Mine, I desire it. Gull. Nay, nere strive, Ile hang you both I warrant you, my daughter was not unknown to some of the bench, and if they would not speak for her in such a case as this, would they might never have good of womans flesh. Oh my daughter! my chast and virtuous daughter. Ex. Enter Sigismond and Catzo as a Lady. Sigis. Thou art a Lady fair one. Catz. I, a horrible painted one. Sigis. And a mighty great one, and therefore Ile court thee. Catz. Tis beyond the art of man to court me fair, I am not to be dealt withall in that kind, and therefore keep off, I am not for your turn, keep off saucy jack. Sigis. Not for my turn? why I am a Prince, and will ingirt thy brow, thy Ivory brow, with stones as precious. Catz. Stones! you can do no good upon me with your stones. Sigis. Grant me but assurance of thy love, Ile dart against Joves thunder, my rivall Jove, whose bolt did cleave my heart, threw and threw, and made a broadway to my brain, when I last courted thee in yonder thicket. Catz. Oh horrible! he has got the true propertie of a Lover, he can lie bravely. Court me in yonder thicket? Sigis. Why? hast thou forgot my sweet duck, look on me my pigsnie, cast but one smile, one gentle smile upon me. Catz. Some smile! I cannot smile for laughing. Sigis. Well remember this, you will not afford me a sheeps eye, say no more, nay nere intreat, thou getst not a kisse, a look, nor a touch, nor a feel, nor a bit of my thums length. Catz. That's but short allowance for a Gentlewoman. Sigis. I must to her again, you do not love me, you do not. Alas! I am ignorant of your tricks, you have forgot, Since you and I plaid last at Maw, when your Ace of harts could not command my Knave of diamonds, til you were glad to lay your five fingers on't. Catz. Maw! fie upon him, what a noddy is this? Sigis. You have forgot since I talk't baudy with your Ladyship by moonshine, and how you swore you dream't of me, till you tickled again, and ever since doated on me with the very conceit of the dream, and now I will make your Ladyship kneel for a kisse, nay humble thy self, and I wo'not come over thee. Catz. Fie, fie, never had Gentlewoman such a suitor. Now by my poating stick, a fit oath for a chambermaid, you shall have him court me in all the true Elements of a drunkard, Fox-like, Lyon-like, and last, Maudlin-like, and so turn all his smiles into tears. Sigis. Not yet? will she not stoop? I must close with her, Come, come, I know you swell now, you grow so plumpe about the lips, suppose I should vouchsafe to kisse this chop cherry now. Catz. I scorne to kisse I can assure thee. Sigis. Disdain a Prince, a Lyon, curtrash parboil'd stuff. What's woman but a hollow vessell, an Aquavite bottle, a washing tub, a box? What is your Ladyship proud of? Catz. Of my Virginity Sir. Sigis. Ile try what kind of stuff your Ladyships Virginitie's made of. Catz. Thou wilt not ravish me, wilt thou? Sigis. By Mars his standard but I will. Catz. By Venus buckler but thou shalt not. Sigis. Thou wilt not draw I hope. Catz. But I will, and defend my maiden honour with my life. Sigis. Put up fair maid, thy chastity orecomes my spleen; Forgive me gentle Love, and I will weep my self to water. Catz. That may be, for your brain swims I am sure, What an asse is this to be in love with me? I am no Lady, Sir, I am your man Catzo. Sigis. Keep off, I shall orewhelme thee else, dost not see me swim and tumble mountain high? thou art a Pinace, art thou? Catz. A kind of a flie-boat, there's a storme toward, my best is to put into harbour. Sigis. Sea room enough or we are lost, amain, amain, Now up, now down again. Tumbles about. Catz. I am sure I have a leak already, help, help, help. Enter Ferdinand and others. Ferd. What means this out cry? Catz. I think he has thrust out my bottome, I shall never live to prove the old proverb true, a young Courtier and an old begger, I have had so many maims in his service. Sigis. Neptune has laid the storme, how calm's the sea now? how silent the windes? all's done, all's done. Catz. All's one for that you, shall not draw me to sea with you again. Ferd. How camest thou thus attired? Catz. He said he would make a Lady on me, but as many Knights do, he has made a poor one of me, he began very hotly. But at last he coold me over head and ears, He handle a Lady! Ferd. This makes me thinke that love was the originall of this untimely extasie, didst never hear him speak of some strange beauty? Catz. He spoke too lately with me, and now I remember me, I left him in the wood with a good handsome Female, and when I found him again, he was as mad as a Hart in rutting time. Enter Vincentio. Ferd. Her sight sure did transport him. What newes Vincentio? Vinc. No great newes, onely a woodman and a maid accus'd of foul lust, this day receive their doom. Ferd. Where were they taken? Vinc. In an obscure Cave within the Forrest. Sigis. That maid would I fain deal withall, command her hither. Why dost not fetch her? Ferd. Be patient, thou shalt along with us. Dost know the face that late ith forrest lost you? Catz. I have cause to know it, they talke of countenances, I got more by that face in an hour, then the best countenance ith' Court will get me in an age, though I were Usher to the best Lady of them all. Ferd. My heart presages; Good heaven work thy will; When we least hope, the heavens prove kindest still, Sirra bring him along. Ex. Catz. Come Sir, will you jog into the Garden? Sigis. You'l bring me to the Lady then. Catz. Yes presently, as soon as ever we can overtake her. Ex. A Bare. Enter Gisbert as a Senator, with others, Oswell, Alexis, Adellezia, Officers. A Senate. Gisb. Stand forth Alexis, though my soul doth tell me, Thy thoughts are cleere from foul unchastitie, Yet since thy Accuser by just course of Law Pursues thy life, thou must endure the hand of peerless justice. Alex. I crave no other, Let equall combat prove us worthy death, Or else just vengeance stop his perjur'd breath. Osw. I seale to thy Request; if in one houre Two witnesses besides my selfe doe not make good This accusation. Exit. Gisb. Your offer stands confirm'd. Officer at Armes If ere the appointed time, these witnesses Make no Appearance, bring into the Lists Those Combatants equally prepar'd. Officer. It shall be done. Gisb. Although my place forbids to doe thee other Right Alexis, yet this comfort I will give thee, which stands for all, No power were just, if guiltlesse men should fall. Alex. I have no other hope, who beares a spotless brest, Doth want no comfort else, how ere distrest. Adel. That speakes our happinesse, for spite of destiny We can nor live nor dye unhappily, How ever Ile conceale my parentage. Exeunt. Gisb. What other cause depends to crave our hearing? Const. Bring em forth; away with em. Enter Constable, Gulman, Lucius, Urania. Vinc. How now, what noyse is this? Gul. Justice, let me have Justice Noble Senators. Gisb. Speake freely, woman thou shalt have thy wish. Gul. Behold the bloody murderers of my innocent daughter. Gisb. How Lucius one of em? vile wretch; Doest thou not know this day doth end thy life, If thou shalt faile to finde thy hapless wife. Luc. That sentence thus is voyd, I here present Your daughter and my wife. Gisb. My daughter! Ura. Oh thinke that I am lost still, or that You ne're were happie in the injoyment of a childe. For know I stand guilty of this abhorred murder. Luc. She wrongs her innocent soule, 'twas this hand did it In just mov'd Anger. Ura. But 'twas I that bid him, And that in Law is principall. Gul. Between em both I have lost my daughter; A very chast Virgin and a vertuous. Luc. A noted whore, a Curtezan. Gisb. Divided soule, in what amazement stand'st thou? On this hand Justice stands, but here a father; Nature thou art powerfull in me; Immaculates Robes, You shall not blush at my partiality. Vinc. What meane you Sir? Gisb. To be a man, a father, oh my Urania! Vinc. This violent passion needs not, Sir possesse your seat againe. Gisb. It suites not with my fortunes, vouchsafe Me leave to plead her cause, you worthy Judges; Behold three lives layd in a doubtfull scale, 'Gainst which a strumpets Lust the ballance swayes; Three worthy lives, if age and fate deny To make mine miserable, which if your gentler hands Refuse to poise, are lost, and must pay the price Of an adulteresse blood. Oh thinke what a whore is! A creature onely shap't like woman, that we might see In that faire foile best her deformitie. The wombe of sinne from whence all horrid crimes, As Rivolets from the Sea, derive their streames; The Devills warehouse, for though we voyd all snares, This surely takes, and here he vends his wares: Which no shop else wu'd utter, hence avarice, Pride, pale murder, all black deeds doe rise; besides, Thinke how she stands in Law, to whom deny'd A Christian Buryall, this Law by which we are try'd, Oh let it not exact such payment then, For those deserve not common Rights of men This is the onely favour I doe crave, Judge her unworthy life as of a grave. Vinc. Your Arguments are forcible; onely let's know The Motives to her death. Luc. Her sensuall rage Brought her into the place, where much unlook'd for Joy forc'd one embrace, The wretch at sight hereof orecome with spleene, Or hatefull Jealousie, with violent hands Did seise my wife, which sight on sodaine raisd My just incensed blood, that with one stroake Her cursed life unhappily I tooke. Gisb. Make it your owne case, thinke how free they stood, In height of their owne Joyes from others blood. Vinc. The case is plaine she sought her owne death Willfully, and seeking her owne ill We judge them free, now take your place agen. Gisb. Beare witnesse, I have playd a fathers part. Vinc. A carefull father. Amb. One most kinde and loving. Gisb. Let me embrace you both; farewell; think here Your father dyes, and now y'are to be doomd by an impartiall Judge. Vinc. What meanes this Circumstance? Gisb. Know that a man consists of soule and body; The one by Nature, the other by Justice rul'd; So he is lesse then man that swerves from either, And disobeyes these equall Governours. What Nature might command I have perform'd; Now Justice takes his place, true partlesse Justice, That heavenly Names bestows upon us here. That we like Gods might no Affection beare; Which once agen commands unto the Barre Those bloody murderers. Vinc. Strange and unheard of. Gisb. Stand forth you haplesse wretches, that have robd A creature of her life, which to restore, Would make the world turne bankrout; nay more, You have robd Heaven of a soule, inforc'd her hence Loaden with all her sinnes without defence; Not given her time to shed one pennitent teare, That might plead for her before that severe And all-confounding Judge, with losse of breath, You have repriev'd her soule to farre worse death. Lastly, you have felloniously usurpt The sword of Government, violated Law, And being borne Subjects, you have assum'd The seat of death-inflicting Soveraigntie; for which We doome youâWeake heart, why, doest thou faint? Thou injurest me: You trayterous eyes, since that You dare not see to doe such worthy Justice On these wretches, I will blind and barre that light, Whose partiall view doe make so few doe right; Now know we doome you for this your horrid murder To present Execution, and command That where the fact was done, a Jibbit stand, On which you both shall suffer forthwith; Officers away, Your lives are forfeit in one houres delay. Vinc. Beyond all president! Luc. For mine owne life, 'Tis justly forfeited, but to this creature Urania, not as she is my wife, But thy daughter, the hope of thy name, And wisht posterity, be pitifull. Gisb. Thou beatst the Ayre, though all the world should fall, Justice must be her selfe, beare equall sail. Ura. Be patient gentle Love, since 'tis for thee, I cannot thinke it is an Ill to die. Father Farewell, your doome I will not grudge, Above I hope to finde a milder Judge. Gisb. Away with emâHeaven on their soules have mercy. Enter Ferdinand. Stay, let me embrace thee, thou perfect'st man That er'e made Nature proud, Renowned Gisbert, Loe as thou gavest unto thy Countryes good Thy onely daughter, having no other gift Worthy thy merit, I returne agen Thy present, which to recompense with any Other Benefit would speake us poore And much ingratefull, in us they both shall live With pardon, so receive them, then. Gisb. As a repreive sent to condemned men. Fer. In whom maist thou survive to endless dayes. As for this loathed Creature Hells Harbinger, this Bawd to sinne, her daughters losse shall take away her bodyes punishment, onely we banish her six miles from any City. Gul. I had rather be Carted six times about the City then live in the Countrey, unlesse your grace will make a continuall progresse. Exit. Fer. Away with her, what meanes this sound? Vinc. It gives a signall to a Combatant that has accus'd a stranger of foule lust with a knowne Shepheard. Fer. Our selfe have heard so much, give him his oath. Vinc. Sweare by thy trust in Heaven thou comst not Armd, led on by malice, or in hope of gaine, but in the Justice of thy cause without eyther charme or guile. Enter Oswell, Alexis, Adelizia: Sigismund gazes on her. Osw. This Ile make good. Ferd. Administer the like Oath to the other. Vinc. Sweare by the equall powers, no hope or confidence, Doth raise thine Arme besides thine Innocence. Alex. I sweare, and if not truely, of Heaven I crave, Instead of ayd, to send a shamefull grave. Ferd. Give signall to the fight. Sigis. Stay. Ferd. What meanes our sonne? Sigis. This she, that brow, that eye, that face doth speake it, give me my Armour there. Catz. Give him his braines there, has most need of them. Sigis. Villaine, Ile teare thy soule out, if thou deferre one minute. Divinest Beauty, oh let me kisse thy hand! Ferd. This accident confounds, speake gentle sonne. Sigis. And if I have a Being worthy you, Deny not my request, or with my Brest Ile naked thus oppose the traytor. Ferd. Thou hast thy wish fayre sonne, bring weapons forth, Some fate directs him thus. Enter Leonardo, Sileus. Vinc. More Champions yet; what meane these strangers? Leo. To prove this Traytor a malicious villaine; That Lady chast and free. Sil. The same cause moveth me to equall Armes. Sigis. You shall be damn'd, first; by my blood and Honour, Who makes an offer to deprive this Arme Of this fayre Conquest, drawes one on himselfe. Ferd. They shall not, I must intreat you give free way unto his passion, being assur'd the hand of Heaven drawes him to end his life or misery. Leo:, Sil. Shall we not have the Honour then? Ferd. Our sonne has begd it, and it must be his. Amb. We'l free him from that danger. Discover themselves. Osw. Vexation. Ferd. How dare you being exild approach this place? Leo. Though not from death this deed shall free one staine, know that our love to Justice, whose wrong erst lost our good names doth force us hither, this is trayterous Oswell. Ferd. Oswell, lay hands upon the Monster. Sil. This Adelizia king Valerius daughter, To whose untimely fall that villaine brib'd us; When this blest Shepheard that preserv'd her breath, Redeemd our lives from a despised death. Ferd. Astonishment! Alex. Dread Soveraigne, accept this Beauteous Princesse, fair Adelizia by me preserv'd after her shipwrack. Ferd. Joy overcomes me, can Adelizia live? Adel. That Letter speakes no lesse. Sig. I know you are the same, my love pursued in those spatious woods. Adel. I am the same. Ferd. Thou hast reviv'd my sonne, restor'd mine age, So many Blessings, Heaven I wish no more. Adel. If any good my Being brings with it, This vertuous Shepheard well may challenge it. Ferd. Our love and high regard shall speake it freely. To you we give your meanes and libertie, to thee. Omnes. Doe but command us we'l teare him peecemeale. Ferd. Though his desert to such extreames might sway, We'l have no blood shed on our wedding day. We doome him to perpetuall prisonment. Osw.
