      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —Hall of Foster's House. Foster and Brown discovered sitting at a table, C. and Richard at a desk near R. S. E. examining account books. Fos. Yon air hath a sweet breath! Brown. We've cause to think so. Fos. Aye, in good sooth we have!—This halcyon breeze Doth play the wanton with our swelling sails, And sends our well fraught vessels, dancing home! Brown. [To Rich.] Are our accounts made even? Rich. To a penny. Fos. As even be our friendship! May our love Increase, as doth our merchandise! Brown. Amen, With all my heart—that golden traffic, love, Is scantier far than gold—One mine of that, More worth than twenty laden argosies. But, Master Foster, now I must be bold, To touch on somewhat that concerns you much. [Both rise. Fos. (L. C.) I guess your subject—my unthrifty brother. Brown. (R. C.) Nay, nay, leave out the adjective, unthrifty. Your brother, sir, 'tis he that I would speak of. Fos. Unthrifty is his proper epithet. Knew you but what my love hath done for him So oft, so chargeable, you would not urge— [Meet at C. Brown. Nay, sir, you must not stay at quantity Until he change his race—remember, sir, He is your brother—aye—your younger brother— In prison now at Ludgate—think, good sir.— Fos. There let him howl—'tis the best stay he hath, For nothing but a prison can contain him. So boundless is his riot. Twice I've rais'd His broken fortunes to a fair estate, But with as fruitless charity as though I'd thrown my substance back into the sea. You must have heard what shoals and quicksands he Finds out; as dice, and cards, and pigeon-holes. Brown. All this may be, sir, yet examples daily Show us that prodigals return at last. And loudest roarers (as our city phrase is) Speak calm and smooth in time. You must hope still; Had I a brother like him, I should think That heav'n had made him as an instrument For my best charity to work upon! Fos. A waste-good and a spendthrift— Brown. Oh, no more. [Goes to L. Fos. [To Rich.] Sirrah, when saw you my son Robert? Speak. Rich. [Comes from the desk.] This morning, sir—He said he would go visit His uncle— Fos. Aye, his uncle, there sir,—there, I pay for all these visits—[Goes to C.]—I am sure That boy makes prize of all his fingers light on, To give his thriftless uncle. [Brown crosses toward R. Brown. (R. C.) By my troth, [Foster crosses toward L. I cannot blame him— Fos. [To Rich. L.] Knave, 'tis partly your fault— You see't and suffer it—How say you, sirrah? Rich. (L.) Sir, mine's a servant's duty, his a son's: Nor know I better how to prove my love Unto yourself, than by thus loving him. Fos. Wink at his thefts?— Rich. I dare not call him so; He is my second master, and methinks 'Tis far above my limits, or to check, Or to complain of him. Brown. Gramercy, Dick, Thou, mak'st a good construction, [To Foster] and your son Acts but a natural part tow'rds his poor uncle. Fos. 'Tis well in neither, sir, [Rich. returns to the desk] note the condition Of my estate—you know I'm lately married To a rich widow, from whose substance mine Doth chiefly rise. She has observed this in Her son-in-law, and oft complains of it. And what foul broils such civil discords bring, Few married men but wot of—nay, sir, would You see a present proof of it—she comes. Enter Mrs. Foster, L. Mrs F. (L.) Shall I not live to breathe a quiet hour?— I would I were a beggar with content Rather than thus be thwarted of mine own! Fos. (L. C.) Why, what's the matter, wife? Mrs F. You wife, indeed, [Brown walks about, R musing. Though you regard not of my just complaints Neither in love to me, nor keeping me, From other's injuries, both which you're tied to By all the rightful laws, divine and human— But I'll complain, sir, where I will be heard!— Fos. Faith, thou'lt be heard too far. Mrs. F. Aye, jeer me, do— Some awkward star threw out its luckless fire At my conception, and 'twill never quench While I have heat in me—Would I were cold!— My death would be a jubilee to some! Fos. Why, wife, how would'st thou I should minister To ills I know not—prithee what's the cause? Mrs. F. Cause!—Grant me patience! Cause!—[Crosses to Brown.] Sir, [To Brown] I threw down My fortunes at his feet—he did not marry me, For love's sake, nor for pity—but for love Of that I had. And now, sir, he neglects me, And lets a prodigal lay waste the blessings Which I had treasured up for the best uses. Fos. Meaning my son. Mrs. F. Aye, he's the conduit-pipe That throws it forth into the common sewer. Fos. Meaning my brother. Mrs. F. Shame upon such kindred, [Returns to the L. I'd make the one a stranger, and the other A servant—he deserves no better office. Fos. Why, woman, did I ever cherish him? Have I not threaten'd him a score of times With disinheritance for this disorder? Mrs. F. Why not perform it?— Fos. There is now no need— Stephen's in Ludgate— Mrs. F. No—he's in this house— Here, sir, within, approving to my face The charitable deeds of his kind nephew, Who, with his pilfering, purloin'd from me, Hath set him loose. Oh, if this may be suffer'd, I'll have no eyes to see! Brown. (R. C.) Be patient, madam— Fos. Prithee content thyself, good wife, I'll find A present remedy [To Rich.] go—call them here. [Exit Rich. L. This worthy gentleman shall know the cause And censure for us both with equity. [Foster and Mrs. Foster retire up on L. and return. Brown. (C.) Nay, good sir, let not me be thus employ'd, For I shall, certes, favour one for pity, The other for your love's sake. Enter Robert and Stephen Foster. Fos. [C. to Rob.] Now, sir, now— Are all my words with you so light esteem'd That they can take no hold upon your duty? Rob. (L. C.) Misconstrue not my deeds, sir, I beseech you— Mrs. F. Nay, he'll approve 'em good, I warrant you! Fos. [To Steph.] And you, sir— Steph. (L. C.) Well, sir— Fos. I thought you in Ludgate— Steph. Then you thought wrong, sir, you see where I am. Fos. How came you out of prison? tell me that. Steph. As I went into prison—through the gate. Fos. [To Robert.] This was your work, to let this ban-dog loose. Rob. Sir, 'twas my duty to let loose my uncle. Fos. Your duty doth belong to me, not him. Rob. You cannot make a separation, sir, Betwixt the duty that belongs to you, And love unto mine uncle. You as well May bid me love my Maker, and neglect The creature which himself hath bid me love. If man to man join not a love on earth, They love not heav'n, nor Him who dwells above it!— My uncle!—Why, sir, he is half yourself. Brown. Believe me, sir, he well hath answer'd you. Fos. He hath not, Master Brown. But, to make void His false construction, I do here disclaim All brotherhood with that vile spendthrift, there. Be thou [To Robert] engaged for any debts of his, In prison rot with him. My goods shall not Purchase such fruitless recompence. Steph. Then thou'rt A scurvy father and a filthy brother. [Brown goes back and stands at the table. Mrs. F. (R. C.) Your tongue, sir, cannot hurt his reputation. Steph. But yours can, Xantippe: for all the city Talks of the wicked scold he 'as ta'en to wife. Fos. [To Robert] If e'er I know thou keep'st him company I'll take my blessing from thee while I live, And that which after me should bless thy state. Steph. And I'll proclaim thy baseness to the world; Ballads I'll make and set to tavern music, To sing thy churlish cruelty. Fos. Tut-tut. Steph. Each holy-day I'll come unto thy house, And spit upon thy threshold. Fos. You must first Be out of prison, sir,— Steph. If I do live To see thee Sheriff, I will kick thy sergeants— Nay, it may chance—thyself— Rob. Prithee, good uncle— Steph. Why, boy, I'll beg for thee—I will, by heav'n! I'll break this leg, and bind it up again, To pull out pity from a stony breast, Rather than thou shalt want. [Mrs. Foster paces about angrily on R. Fos. Aye, do, sir,—do— And let him sear his arm and scarf it up, Then beg beneath a hedge and share your bounty. But come not near my house. Nor thou, boy, in His company—dost mark me, boy? thoud'st best. We've stocks and gaol for him—for thee there's worse— The loss of all that's mine save, my dear curse! [Exeunt Foster, Mrs. F. and Brown, R. Steph. [Crossing and calling.] Thou churl! thou dog! thou rascally old miser! Rob. (C.) Nay, nay, good uncle, throw not out foul language. This is but heat, sir, and I doubt not but To cool this rage with my obedience. But, uncle, you must not heap on such fuel. Steph. (C.) Coz, I grieve for thee, that thou hazard'st thus Thy father's curse, for love unto thine uncle. Rob. Let pity then for me, turn to yourself: Bethink you, sir, of some good course that might Befit your state, and let me guide it for you. Steph. Ha! a course! s'foot! I have it. Coz, canst lend me forty shillings? Could I but repair this old decay'd tenement of mine with some new plaster, for alas! what can a man do in such a case as this? [Looking down at his dress. Rob. But your course, uncle? Steph. Tush! leave that to me, because thou shalt wonder at it: if you should see me in a scarlet gown, within the compass of a gold chain, then I hope you'll say that I do keep myself in good compass: then, sir, if the cap of maintenance do march before me, and not a hood be suffered to be worn in my presence, prithee do not upbraid me with my former poverty; I cannot tell—State and wealth may make a man forget himself—but I beseech you do not upbraid me. Coz, there are things in my brain that you dream not of—Dare you try me, Coz? Rob. Why forty shillings, uncle, shall not mar Your fortunes. [Goes back to the table and takes out his purse. Steph. [Remains in front.] Gramercy, Coz! [Aside.] Now if the dice would but run right, these forty shillings might set me up again, and no more trouble. What shall I do? If I lay them out in clothes and after pawn them—why there's no broker in London would give me half the worth o't. No, no—while tis in ready cash, that's the surest way—Seven's the main! a plague take the bones, an' they will not favor a man sometimes. Rob. Look you, uncle, there are forty shillings. [Gives them to him. Steph. As many good angels guard thee as thou hast given me bad ones to seduce me, for these deputy devils damn worse than the old ones. Now, coz, pray listen —listen after my transformation: I will henceforth be an apostate to prodigality; I will eat cheese and onions and buy lordships; and will not that be strange? Rob. I am glad you are merry, sir, but this is fixt Between an uncle and a nephew's love; Though my estate be poor, revenues scant, Whilst I have any left, you shall not want. Steph. By this hand, Coz, I'll make thee an alderman ere I die— Do but follow my steps, Coz—Do but follow my steps. [Exeunt Stephen and Robert, L. SCENE II. —A rich Apartment at the Widow Welsted's. Enter Widow and Clown, R. Widow. (C.) Sirrah, will the churchman come I sent you for? Clown. Yes, mistress, he will come: but pray resolve me one thing for my long service; what business have you with the churchman? Is it to make your will or to get you a new husband? Widow. Suppose to make my will, how then? Clown. Then I would desire you to remember me, mistress—I have served you faithfully—make a good will if you mean to die, that it may not be said “Though most women be long lived, yet they all die with an ill will.” Widow. How if it be for marriage? Clown. Then I would desire you to remember yourself, mistress. Take heed how you give away the sword, to defend yourself with the scabbard. This is the instruction of a friend; I would be loth to see you cast down and not well taken up. Widow. Well, sir, well, let not this trouble you;—see he's come: will you be gone? Enter Churchman, L. Clown. I will first give him a caveat to use you as kindly as he can.[To Churchman,—crosses to meet him.] Save you, reverend sir. Church. And you, fool. [Widow walks up the stage. Clown. (L. C.) Sir, if you find my mistress have a mind to a fresh husband or so, use her as well as you can; let her enter into as easy bands as may be. Church. Fool, this is none of my traffic—I sell no husbands. Clown. There you are wrong, sir, for you take money for them—what woman can have a husband if she pay not you for him? [She comes down on R.] and often the ware proves naught too, not worth the impost. Church. [To Widow] Your man is merry, madam. Widow. (R. C.) He's saucy, sir,—sirrah, you'll begone! Clown. Nay, at the second hand you'll have a fee too; you sell in the church, and they bring 'em again to your churchyard. There's more tollage! methinks if a man die whether you will or no, he should be buried whether you will or no. Wid. (C.) Begone, I say, sirrah. Clown. Mistress, make him your friend: for he knows what rate good husbands are at.—Nay, I am gone, mistress. [Exit Clown, L. Church. (C.) You sent for me, madam. Wid. I did, sir: to this end: I have some scruples, Doctor, in my conscience; Some doubtful problems which I cannot answer, Nor reconcile; I'd have you make them plain. Church. This is my duty: pray you speak your mind. Wid. And as I speak I must remember Heav'n That gave those blessings which I must relate. Sir, you behold in me, a wond'rous woman— You only wonder at the epithet; I can approve it good: guess at mine age. Church. At the half way between twenty and thirty. Wid. Not much amiss; yet nearest to the last. How think you then, sir, is not this a wonder? That a woman lives full eight and twenty years Maid to a wife, and wife unto a widow, Now widow'd and mine own, yet all this while From the extremest verge of my remembrance, Even from my weaning hour unto this minute. Did never taste what was calamity? I know not yet what grief is, yet have sought An hundred ways for its acquaintance. Prosperity hath watch'd so closely o'er me, That even those things I have meant a cross Have that way turn'd a blessing—I'st not strange? Church. Unparallel'd; this gift is singular, Belonging but to you—You are the moon, For there's but one. All women else are stars, For there are none of like condition. But soft, I pray you, let me question you; You lost a husband, grieved you not for that? Wid. O, sir, your pardon. Death's the heritage Of all mankind: the grief from which No mortal is exempt—Be not so literal In your constructions—Though even from death, I have known less affliction than pertains Unto the common lot. My parents died Ere I could know their loss: and for my husband, Although I mourn'd him much, in grief's despite I joy'd withal that I had found a grief. And this is all the sorrow I have known. Church. No trip of fate?—Sure it is wonderful! Wid. Aye, sir, 'tis wonderful:—but is it well? Sure I have heard you say the child of heav'n Shall suffer many tribulations; nay, E'en kings and princes share them with their subjects: Then I that know not any chastisement, May I not doubt my part in heaven's dear love? Church. 'Tis a good doubt—but make it not extreme; 'Tis some affliction, that your are afflicted For e'en affliction's want. Cherish thou that. Your blessings, lady, are free gifts from heaven, Health, wealth, and peace; nor can they turn to curses, But by abuse. Re-enter Clown, L. Clown. Mistress, there's one without would speak with you, that vexeth as fast against crosses as you do against good luck. Wid. I know her, sure, then, 'tis my gossip, Foster. Request her in. Say, here's good company. Clown. Marry, I'll say so for my own credit's sake. [Exit Clown, L. Wid. Now you shall see a perfect contrary. Would I could change hearts with her for a time! 'Twould make me better relish happiness. Enter Mrs. Foster, L. Mrs. F. (L.) O, friend and gossip, where are you?—I am O'erladen with my griefs. Sure never woman Had a more sinister fate! All ominous stars Were in conjunction at my hapless birth, And still attend me! Wid. What's the matter, gossip. Church. [Aside, R.] This is a perfect contrary indeed! Mrs. E. Unless seven witches had set spells about me, I could not be so cross'd; never at quiet, No happy hour, not a minute's content. Wid. That cannot be, friend—You've a most kind husband. Church. A man of fair condition, well reputed. Mrs. F. (L. C.) Alack it matters not. He hath a son That makes my state his prodigality. Aye, and a brother, one o' the city scandals, One is the hand, the other is the maw; And between both my goods are swallow'd up. Believe me, what I brought unto mine husband Is now consumed to half! Wid. Canst thou devise To lay a part of these same griefs on me? I'll bear them willingly. Mrs. F. O! would I could! that I might rest the while! But you are wise to heed at other's harms; You'll keep you happy in your widowhood. Wid. I'faith, not I, were I but sure that marriage Would ruffle this smooth stream of happiness With a brisk storm or two. Mrs. F. I warrant you— Try, gossip, try, you shall not need to wish: You'll sing another song, and bear a part In my grief's descant. You have a light heart now. Widow. And so should you have were you ruled by me. It is spleen that weighs it down. Come, friends, We'll dine together; after walk abroad Unto my suburb garden; where, if thou [To Mrs. F. Wilt hear, I'll read my heart to thee, and school thee How to put by the thrust of care with patience. [Takes her hand, and leads off, R. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —Exterior of a Tavern and Dicing House in the suburbs of London, with Garden and Entrance to Bowling Alley. Stephen, Foster, Sharpe, Fleece, and Gauntlet, seated at a Table in front of the House, drinking. All. Ha! ha! ha! Steph. Roar away! roar away! my brave wags! [Sings. “The Holly stands within the hall, so fair to behold; The Ivy stands without the door, she is full sore a cold. The Holly and his merry men they dance and they sing, But the Ivy and her maidens they are aye weeping.” Why Host! Host, I say! Enter Host, from the House. Host. Now my merchants of Bona Speranza? What's your will, my brave bullies? Steph. Dice, dice, mine Host! and some more sack here.—Ha! say I right, gentlemen? Shall we trundle —shall we cut—shall we handle the bones? Sharpe. Passage, novum, mumchance—what you will— Gaunt. Who's in the bowling alley? Host. Honest traders—thrifty lads—towardly boys, I promise you. Steph. Give us a bale of dice—Presto, man! will ye sweet wags? [Sings again “The holly hath of birdies a full fair flock; The nightingale, the popinjay, and the gent le lav-rock Good ivy, good ivy, what birdies have you? O, I've none but the howlett that cryeth ‘tu whoo!’” Host. [Who has entered the house, returns with dice.] —Here, my brave bursemen— Fleece. But have you no room empty? Host. Not a hole unstopp'd in my house. Steph. No matter—no matter—come—trip! Fleece. Up with's heels! Sharpe. A fair passage, sweet bones! [Throws.—Noise in the Bowling Alley (L. U. E.) of betting and wrangling Host. How now, my fine trundletails!—My bowling alley in an uproar?—Take heed, my roaring Tamberlanes—the Soldan comes; he that breaks the peace, I break his pate. Have among you then! [Exit Host. Steph. The dice are mine—set me fair—aloft now! [Throws. Fleece. Out! Steph. What was't? Sharpe. Two treys and an ace. Steph. Seven still! Plague on't, that number of the deadly sins haunts me cursedly! Come, sir, throw. Dame fortune, I drink to thee. [Drinks. Fleece. Have at 'em, faith! [Throws. Gaunt. Two quatres and a trey! Steph. The devil's in the dice! [Throws down money.] More sack here! Gaunt. Now sweet bones!—Twelve at all! [Throws. Steph. Done, by Jupiter! [Throws down more money.] Soft! this die is false! Gaunt. I'll be hang'd then! Steph. I say it's false, and I'll have my money again. Gaunt. Will you? You shall have cold iron with your silver then. [Draws—Stephen snatches up a chair. Steph. Have at thee, scum! Sharpe. Stand by our fellow. [They draw and attack Stephen, who defends himself with the chair. Enter Host and Robert Foster. R. Host. Hold, hold! An' ye be gentlemen, hold! Rob. Away varlets! [Draws and beats off Gamesters, who fly. Exit Host, into house. Steph. The coney-catching rascals! Rob. Uncle, uncle, is this the reformation you promised me? Steph. Coz, after this day I protest you shall never see me handle those bones again!—This day I break up school—If ever you call me unthrift after this day— you do me wrong. Rob. I should be glad to wrong you so, uncle; come this way, sir—I would not for the world a friend of my father's should see you thus, or here. Enter behind, the Widow Welsted, Mrs. Foster, and Clown, R. Clown. [Stands back.] You've hunted well, mistress, the hare's in sight. Mrs. F. (R.) Did I not tell you so?—I knew his gait— And with his uncle! Wid. (R.) [Aside.] A proper man that uncle. Rob. [Seeing Mrs. Foster.] Mother!—I'm sorry you have trod this path! Mrs. F. (C.) Mother, thou wretch!—Hang thee!—I bore thee not. But much affliction have I borne for thee: Wert thou mine own, I'd see thee coffin'd, filth, Ere thou shouldest vex me thus. Rob. (C.) Were I your own, You could not use me worse than you do now. Mrs. F. I'll make thy father turn thee out for ever, Or else I'll make him wish him in his grave, You'll witness with me, gossip, where I found him. [To Widow. Clown. Nay, I'll be sworn upon a book of that. Rob. It shall not need, for I will not deny it. Mrs. F. And that shall disinherit thee. Thou'dst better Have been a viper born, than tempt me thus! Steph. (L.) Thou liest, Xantippe. It had been better Thou hadst been press'd to death between two rugs, Than ride that Socrates, thy husband, thus, And rate his honest child. Mrs. F. Thou ragamuffin! Thou sot!—Dost thou talk?—I shall see thee shortly. Again in Ludgate. Steph. No, at Moorgate, beldame, Where I shall see thee in the ducking stool! If you complain upon mine honest coz, And that his father be offended with him, The next time that I meet thee in the streets I'll dance i'the dirt upon thy velvet hood— Nay, worse than that— I'll— Rob. Uncle! Uncle!— Mrs. F. Oh! my heart!—my heart! Was ever woman thus abus'd?—Oh! that I could Spit wildfire!—But I'll do your errands, rogues! I will, or I'm no honest woman!—Nay— Excuse me, gossip, I must to my husband! [Exit Mrs. Foster, L. Rob. [To Widow.] Kind gentlewoman, you have some patience— Wid. I have too much, sir,— Rob. You may do a good office, and make yourself a peaceful moderator between me and my angry father, whom his wife hath moved to spleen against me. Wid. Sir, I will think of it—but with your leave, I'd now speak with your uncle. Clown. [To Robert.] You may talk with me, sir, in the mean time. [Robert and Clown retire, R. U. E. Wid. [To Stephen.] Sir;—Master Stephen Foster!— Steph. (L. C.) Well,—what would you with me, gentlewoman? Wid. (C.) You are a brave unthrift— Steph. Whate'er I be—I'll be no pupil to a woman, so you may leave your discipline. Wid. Nay, pray you hear me, sir,—I cannot chide—I would but counsel you:—this is not a good course which you run. Steph. Good or bad, I must run to the end of it— Wid. I would teach you a better, if you would stay where you are. Steph. Stay where I am, that would I willingly, an' I had any more money. Wid. What, in the dicing house? Steph. Aye, marry would I! I've play'd at passage all this while, now I'd go to hazard. Wid. Hast thou no wit? Steph. No wit, say'st thou? by'r Lady? what dost think I live on?—why 'tis all the portion I have— I've nothing to maintain me but my wit, my coin's too scant, I'm sure. [Robert and Clown go off, R. U. E. Wid. I cannot believe thy wit more than thy coin—a man so well limb'd and want! Steph. Why, mistress, my shoulders were not made for a frock and basket, nor a coal-sack—no—nor my hands to turn a trencher at a table's side. I'm a gentleman! Wid. A very poor one. Steph. The fortune of the dice. Wid. They are the only wizards, I confess. The only fortune tellers, but he that goes To seek his fortune from them, ne'er must hope To have good destiny allotted him. 'Tis not the course that I dislike in thee So much, but thou can'st not make that course To out-cross them that cross thee, were but I, As thou art— Steph. You'd be beggarly as I am. Wid. Marry I'll be hang'd first—I would tell some rich widow such a tale in her ear— [Looking archly from under her veil. Steph. Ha!—some rich widow! by this pennyless pocket! I think 'twere not the worst way. Wid. Art not ashamed to take such a fruitless oath?— I say, seek out some rich widow—promise her fair—she's apt to believe a young man—marry her and let her estate fly; 'tis charity. This is not one of Hercules' labours. Steph. Humph! Let me recount these articles: “seek her out—promise her fair—marry her—let her estate fly” —But where shall I find her? Wid. The easiest of all—Why, man, they are more common than tavern bushes. Two fairs might be furnish'd every week in London with 'em, though no foreigners came in, if the charter were once granted. 'Tis thought if the horse-market be removed that Smithfield shall be so employed, and then, I'll warrant you, it will be as well furnish'd with widows, as it was with trotting jades before. Steph. S'foot! if it were, I would be a chapman—I'd see, for my pleasure, and buy for my love, for money I have none. Wid. That shall not stay the market, if thou'lt be ruled. I'll find thee out a widow, if thou'lt but promise me the last—to let her estate fly: for she is one I love not, and I'd be glad to see that revenge on her. Steph. Spend her estate!—that would I—wer't five Aldermen's!—I'll put you in security for that—All my neighbours shall be bound for me—nay, my kind sister-in-law shall pass her word for that. [Rob. and Clown re-enter R. U. E. Wid. I'll show thee the party—what sayst thou to myself? [Takes off her veil.] Agnes Welsted, the Widow of Cornhill?— Steph. Yourself, gentlewoman! by'r lady! I would it were no worse! Wid. I have a lease of thousands or so—what say you, sir?— Steph. Say! Why that I'll let out your leases for you, if you'll allow me the power—aye, and love thee heartily too, lady. Wid. That's my hope, sir, give me thy company home, thou shalt have better clothes, and if I like thee, then we may chance make a blind bargain of it. Steph. No, I'll make no blind bargain—either promise me marriage or I'll not budge a foot. Wid. Are you grown so stout already? Steph. I'll grow stouter when I'm married!— Wid. Here's my hand, I'm thine, thou'rt mine. I'll have thee with all thy faults. Steph. You shall have one with some an' you have me. Wid. Here are witnesses: [To Rob.] Come hither, sir; cousin I must call you shortly—and you, sirrah, [To Clown.] be witness of this match. Here are man and wife. [Rob. and Clown come down on R. Rob. (R. C.) I joy at my uncle's happiness, widow. Clown. I do forbid the banns. Alas, poor bird! my mistress doth but gull thee. [To Steph. Wid. You'll let me dispose of myself, I hope? Clown. (C.) Ay!—you love to be merry, mistress. Come, come, give him four farthings and let him go— he'll pray for his good dame and be drunk—Why, if you must have a husband—how think you?—I should say this were the sweeter bit— [Pointing to himself.] Choose, mistress. Wid. Fool, I have chosen, this is my husband. Steph. [Kissing her.] 'Tis sealed! I'm thine. Now coz, [Crosses to Rob.]—fear no black storms, if thy father thunder, come to me for shelter; thou shalt be my son now. Wid. His word's a deed, sir. Rob. I thank you both—Uncle—what my joy conceives, I cannot utter yet. Clown. I will make black Monday of this! Ere I suffer this disgrace, the kennel shall run with blood and rags. Rob. Sir, I'm your opposite. Clown. I have nothing to say to you, sir, I aim at your uncle. Rob. He hath no weapon, sir fool. Clown. That's all one. I'll take him as I find him. Wid. I have taken him so, before you, sirrah: will you be quiet?— Steph. Wife, your hand. Son, you will follow us. Rob. Upon the instant. [Exeunt Steph. and Wid. R. Clown. Is it come to this? Have I stood all this while to my mistress, and honest, handsome, plain-dealing, serving creature, and she to marry a tytyre-tu-tattere with never a good rag about him. [Half drawing his Sword.] Stand thou to me and be my friend; and since my mistress hath forsaken me— Rob. Well, sirrah— [Pulling him round. Clown. I'll go get my dinner. [Exeunt, R. SCENE II. —An Apartment at Walter Brown's. Enter Brown leading Jane, and followed by Sir Godfrey Speedwell and Master Innocent Lambskin, R Brown. (R.) Gentlemen, you are welcome; that once well pronounced hath a thousand echoes: let it suffice I have spoke it to the full. Here's your merchandise, this is your prize—[Pointing to Jane.] If you can mix your gentle bloods with that of a poor citizen, here is my daughter to greet and court; clap hands and strike the bargain; please her and you please me, sirs. Sir G. (L. C.) Well spoken, by my knighthood! Sweet virgin, to be prolix and tedious fits me not; my name is Speedwell by my father's copy, to which my godfather by his bounty, being an old soldier and having served in the wars as far as Boulogne, prefix'd the name of Godfrey, a title of large renown. My wealth and wit have added to those the paraphrase of knighthood; so that my name is in full length Sir Godfrey Speedwell. Jane. (R. C.) A fair name, sir. Lamb. (L.) Nay, if names can do any good: I beseech you to observe mine, sweet mistress; my name is Lambskin— Jane. A most harmless name, sir. Lamb. Aye, marry it is; and in good troth—and moreover, lady, my godfather seeing in my face some notes of disposition, did give me in my cradle the name of Innocent, which I trust I have deserved all my lifetime, and since my father's decease, my wealth has purchased me the paraphrase of gentility: so that I am called Master Innocent Lambskin. Jane. [Aside.] I am like to have a couple of fair chapmen; if they were at my own dispose, I would willingly raffle them both at twelve-pence a share. Sir G. But to the purpose, sweet female. I do love you with a most singular affection. Jane. Sir, I thank you— Lamb. Nay, for the matter of that, I love you too, fair maid, double and treble, if it please you. Jane. I thank you too, sir. I am so much beholden to you both, I am afraid I shall never requite it. Sir G. Requite one, sweet chastity! and let it be Sir Godfrey,—I will maintain you like a lady. I will, by my knighthood! and that will be bravely, as you shall find by experience. Lamb. I will maintain you like a gentlewoman, mistress. And that may be better maintenance than a lady's, as you may find by observation. Sir G. How dare you maintain that, sir? Lamb. I dare maintain it with my purse, sir. Sir G. [Draws his sword and drives him L.] I dare cross it with my sword, sir! Lamb. If you dare cross my purse with your sword, sir, I'll lay an action of suspicion of felony to you, that's flat, sir. Jane. Nay, pray gentlemen do not quarrel, till you know what for. Brown. O, no quarrelling, I beseech you, gentlemen! the reputation of my house is soiled if any uncivil noise arise in it. Lamb. Let him but shake his blade at me, and I'll throw down my purse and cry thieves!—I scorn to kill him, but I'll hang his knighthood, I warrant him, if he offer assault and battery on my purse. Jane. [To Sir Godfrey.] Nay, good sir, keep up your sword. Sir G. Your command, lady, could make a very coward of me. I speak sooth, by my knighthood!—Master Lambskin, you may live. [Turns and takes the hand of Jane.] The conjunction of Venus and Mars is a white hour in thy nativity. Enter George, L. George. [To Brown.] Sir, here's young Master Foster desires to speak with you. Brown. Please you, gentlemen, to taste the sweetness of my garden awhile, and let my daughter bear you company. Sir G. Where she is leader there will be followers. Jane. [Aside to her Father.] You send me to the gallies, sir; pray you redeem me as soon as you can: these are pretty things for mirth but not for serious uses. Brown. Pr'ythee be merry with 'em awhile, if but for courtesy; thou hast wit enough; but take heed they quarrel not. Jane. Nay, I dare take in hand to part them without danger, but I beseech you let me not be too long a prisoner. [Aloud to Sir G. and Lamb.] Will you walk, gentlemen? Lamb. [Going to Jane, R. C.] If it please you to place one of us for your conduct, mistress. Jane. Sir Godfrey, you are the eldest, pray, lead the way. Sir G. Ah, ha! Sayst thou so, sweet virgin.—Master Innocent, come you behind. [Thrusts him back.] Your hand, fair feminine. [Sir Godfrey leads out Jane, R.] Lamb. (C.) Master Brown, I pray you observe it is the lady I follow. I pray you conceit not that I page the heels of that scurvy knight. It is the lady I follow; mark you that, Master Brown. [Exit Lamb. R. Brown. So—Now request young Master Foster in, George—but hark! does that news hold still—that our ships are so near return as riding in the Downs? George. Yes, sir; and the next tide purpose to put into the river. Brown. Let Him be ever bless'd who sent!—Now, call in the young man, and from him run to his father, and request him to me: this news I am sure makes him a joyful merchant. [Exit George, L.] Would that this son of his were a third suitor to my daughter Jane!—I should like him better than all who have come before.—Well, who can say?—he hath not seen her yet. Enter Robert, L. Now, Master Robert, are your father and yourself yet reconciled? Rob. (L.) Sir, 'twas my business in your courteous tongue To place the arbitration.—I've again Reliev'd my uncle and displeased my father, Whose anger now so great is multiplied, I dare not venture in his house or sight Till your persuasion shall with fair excuse Have made my satisfaction. Brown. (C.) Mother-o'pearl! 'Tis a shrewd task, sir. I will do my best. But womens' tongues are dangerous stumbling blocks To lie in the way of peace. Re-enter George, L. Now, George, what say'st thou? George. Sir, Master Foster's coming— Rob. (C.) I beseech you, Let us not meet till you have spoken with him. Brown. You shall not—George, go call my daughter forth From out the garden. [Exit George, R. Rob. Daughter, said you, sir? Brown. Aye, sir, my daughter Jane; you've heard me speak Of one I had i' the North with some kind friends, Who took her from a widow'd home, and rear'd A plant that thriv'd not in this city's air. It is a fair tree now, I promise you, And well worth looking on; but tell me, sir, How fares your uncle? Rob. Sir, he fares so well, That I'd be loth t'anticipate the fame That will spread shortly of his mended fortunes. Brown. Why I commend thee still—he lacks, I find, No good from thee, not even in report; 'Tis well done, sir, and you show duty in it. Re-enter Jane, R. Daughter, this is young Master Foster, the good son Of my old friend—Where are your lusty suitors? Jane. I was glad of my release, sir.—Suitors call you them; in good truth they suit not me; I'd keep water continually boiling but I'd seeth such suitors! I have had much ado to keep them from bloodshed! Ha! ha! ha! I have seen for all the world a couple of cowardly curs quarrel in the same fashion; as the one turns his head, the other snaps behind, ha! ha! ha! But, thank heaven, they are gone for the present. [Talks aside with her Father up the Stage. Rob. [Aside, L.] Can she be mortal? I have read of shapes Like that, in legends of the olden days— The beautiful imaginings of men, Rapt and inspired! Such a form she wore, The nymph of Elis, whom the river god Through earth and ocean follow'd—or young Thisbe, The fond, ill-fated girl of Babylon! How fair her forehead is! and that soft cheek Wherein the bashful blood seems loath to dwell Lest it should stain such purity! her eyes, How bright, and yet how full of gentleness! Fit lamps for such a shrine! what heart may 'scape The silken meshes of yon nut-brown hair, That clusters round her neck, like a dark vine, About the shaft of some unspotted column; I will not wink, for fear the vision pass, And leave me sorrowing. Brown. [Aside to Jane coming down on R.] Well daughter, well— Say a third trouble came—say in the person of young Master Foster, Here came a third suitor: How then? Jane. Three's the woman's total arithmetic: Indeed I would learn to number no further, if there was a good account made of that. Brown. [Aloud.] Go, get you together. [Turns to Robert.] Your father, sir, will be soon here, leave me with your suit to him. [Aside.] Jane, use him kindly, he shall be his father's heir, I can tell thee. Jane. Never the more for that, sir; if I use him kindly, it shall be for his own sake and not for any good he borrows of his father. [Aloud to Robert.] Sir, will you walk into the garden? Rob. [Aside.] She speaks, and to me. [Aloud.] Sweet, may I take this hand? Jane. (C.) Aye, sir, so you play it fairly. You'll lose by it else, believe me. Rob. I would lose more than I shall ever own for it. Brown. Away! here comes your father. [Exeunt Rob. and Jane, R. Enter Foster and Mrs. Foster, usher'd in by George, L. Now, my good friend, have you heard the news?— Fos. (C.) I have! I have! our ventures have returned At sixty fold increase. Brown. (C.) Heav'n take the glory! [Mrs. F. goes back on L. And keep us strong against these flowing tides! Man is too weak to bound himself below, When such high waves do mount him. Fos. Sir, if you please, I'll ease you of all care; And, like a full adventurer here, bid you A certain ready sum for your part traffic. Brown. With all my heart, and be you gainer by it. Fos. Come, shall I bid you, venture at a venture? Brown. I pray you do, sir. Fos. Twenty thousand pounds. Brown. Well, it is yours, sir. Fos. And if you like my payment; 'Tis half in ready cash, the other sealed For six months. Brown. Why, tis merchant-like and fair, George; you observe this. See the papers drawn. George. I will, sir. Fos. Now your hazard's past. Brown. I do Rejoice at it, and shall not grudge your gains, Though multiplied by thousands; but one thing At this advantage of my love to you, Let me entreat— Fos. Speak, Master Brown, what is it? Brown. Faith, my old suit. To reconcile these breaches 'Twixt your kind son and you; let not the love He shows his uncle longer be a bar Between your blessing and his duty, sir. Fos. I would you had enjoin'd me some great labour, For your own love's sake: for to that my vow Stands fix'd— Mrs. F. (L. C.) Nay, Master Brown, if you knew all, You would not waste your words in such a suit; Since his last reformation he hath flown Out, once again, and in my sight relieved His uncle in the dicing house, for which, Or he shall be no father unto him, Or husband unto me. Brown. George, call my daughter, And bid her bring her friend along with her. [Exit George. Sir, I must needs make him your son again. Fos. Sir, I have no such thing akin to me. Re-enter Robert and Jane, R. Brown. Know you not this youth, sir? Fos. Not I, sir, he's a stranger to me. Mrs. F. [To Robert.] Go to your uncle, sir, you know where to find him; He's at his old haunts, and wants more money by this time. Fos. Did he not say he'd beg for you?—You'd best make use of his bounty. Brown. Nay, good sir— Fos. Sir, if your daughter cast any eye of favour upon this unthrift—restrain it—he's a beggar. Mistress Jane, take heed what you do. Mrs. F. [Crosses to her.] Aye, aye, be wise, Mistress Jane; do not you trust to time turning spleen to pity; you'll not find it so; therefore, good gentlewoman, take heed. Brown. Nay, then you're too impenetrable. Fos. Sir, your money shall be ready, and your bills— other business I have none with you. For thee [to Robert] beg, steal, hang, die!—Such blessing only shalt thou have from me. [Exeunt Foster and Mrs. Foster, L Brown. (C.) Young man be comforted; I will not leave till I find some remorse. Meantime, I pray, let not want trouble you, You shall not know it. Rob. (C.) 'Tis not want I fear, But want of blessing, sir. Brown. [To Jane.] Hark, in your ear, child. How have you parley'd in the garden, eh? Jane. Well, father, yet not much. I requested him to pull me a pear; and, had I not look'd to him, he'd have mistook, and given me a popperin. Brown. Ha! are there sparks kindled?—Quench them not for me.—'Tis not a parent's roughness shall deter me. [Aloud.] Sir, I must presently rejoin your father, whom I'll once more move in your behalf; and, if I can, return him back to love. Come, walk you both till then with me. [Exeunt, L.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —Rich apartment at Mrs. Stephen Foster's, late the Widow Welsted. Enter Mrs. Stephen Foster, R. Mrs. Steph. (C.) I've made a speedy choice and a swift marriage. Well, be it as it will, I like the man. Enter Clown, L. Now fool, where is thy master? Clown. In the counting-house, tumbling over his money bags. You shall hear of him in the bowling alley again shortly. Mrs. Steph. Why, sir, all's his, and at his own dispose. Who shall dare thwart him? Clown. Here he comes. [Goes back. Enter Stephen, L. richly apparelled, with a handful of Bills and Bonds. Mrs. Steph. Why, how now, sweetheart? What hast there, I pray? Steph. (C.) I find much debts belonging to you, sweet, And my care now must be to fetch them in. Mrs. S. (C.) Your care! Ha! ha! Do not mistake thyself, Nor my true purpose. Sir, I did not wed To thrall or bind thy large expense, but rather To add a plenty to't. I thought, ere this, Thou would'st have stuff'd thy pockets full of gold, And thrown it at a hazard—made ducks and drakes, And bated fishes with thy silver flies; Lost and fetch'd more. Why, this had been my joy; Nay, had'st thou wasted all. Steph. Content thee, sweet, Those days are gone, even from my memory; I have forgot that I e'er had such follies, And I'll not call 'em back: my cares are bent To keep your state, and give you happiness. Sirrah, [To Clown.] go, call your fellow-servants up, And to my chamber bring all books of debt; I will o'erlook, and cast up all accounts, That I may know the true weight of our substance, And once a year give up my stewardship. [Goes back. Mrs. Steph. (C.) Astonishment! Clown. (C.) [Aside to her.] Now you may see what hasty matching is: you had thought to have been vex'd, and now you cannot. You've married a husband, that now being my master-in-law, will, I do think, prove the most miserable, covetous rascal that ever beat beggar from his gate. But 'tis no matter— Time was when you were fairly offer'd if you would have taken it. You might have had other matches, and those that would have cross'd you. I would have sold away all you had—have turn'd you out of doors, and used you like a woman. Whereas now, if you hang yourself you can have none of these blessings. But its well enough—now you must take what follows. [Exit Clown, R. Mrs. Steph. Will the tide never turn? [Crosses to R. Was ever woman Thus burden'd with increasing happiness? I married him to waste my goods, and he Strives to augment them. [He comes down in C. Enter Robert, L. Steph. Oh, nephew, are you come? How does your father use you? Is your name Again found in his books? Rob. (L. C.) 'Tis blotted quite! For by the cruel instigation of My step-mother, his vows and oaths are stamp'd Never to call or bless me as his child. Steph. Grieve not, kind coz, that father lost at home You shall find here—for his inheritance You meet another amply proffer'd you— Be my adopted son—no more my kinsman. [To his Wife.] So that this borrowed bounty do not stray From your consent? Mrs. Steph. [Turns to C.] Call it not borrowed, sir, 'tis all your own! Let him be largely texted in your love. He is our child by the most free adoption. Steph. (C.) Thanks, sweetest. Rob. You were born to bless us both— My knee shall ever practise a son's duty; Yet not forgetting that I owe my father, Whene'er I meet him he shall have it too, Although his blessing ne'er return to me. Steph. Come then, my son; be thou my deputy, The factor and disposer of my business; Keep my accounts, and order my affairs— They must all be your own. For you, sweet wife, Be merry—take your pleasure, here abroad— Visit your neighbours—to the country ride; If you have troubles, throw them all aside, And I will take them up.—'Tis fit that weight Should now be all on me. Take thou the height Of quiet and content. Let nothing grieve thee: I brought thee nothing else, and that I'll give thee. [Goes off embracing, Robert following.—Exeunt, R. SCENE II. —A Court-yard before Brown's House. Enter Brown and Foster, followed by George and Richard, bearing Money Bags, L. Brown. (C.) So, so, in with them to the counting-house. [Exeunt George and Richard into House. [To Foster.] Here's my receipt, sir, for the one-half debt. Ten thousand pounds, and now it but remains, You seal the writings which assure the rest. Fos. (C.) Pray, stay, sir, I've bethought me. Let me once Throw dice at all. I have of wares now vendible, So much as will defray your utmost penny; Will you accept of them and save this charge Of wax and parchment? Brown. Willingly, provided You make your rates so that I be no loser. Fos. I have no other end. They're broad cloths, kerseys, That will not stay two days upon your hands. [Re-enter George and Richard, from the house in back ground. Brown. Here's a new business, George—Richard and you Must deal for some commodities betwixt us, If you agree, take carriage presently, And bring them home. This is the bargain. [Talks aside with George near the house. Fos. [To Richard.] What news o'the shipping? Rich. Nothing further, sir. This tide should bring them into Catherine's Pool, The wind's being friendly. Fos. Listen their arrival, And bid the gunner speak it in's loud thunder The city over!—till the merchants' ears Tingle to learn of my abundant wealth! Rich. I shall, sir. Brown. George, go with him. [Exeunt George and Richard into the house. Fos. I must now plainly tell you, Master Brown, I shall gain much by you. The half o' your ship Defrays my full cost. Brown. (R. C.) I begrudge it not, Being a sufficient gainer by my venture. Enter Mrs. Foster, R. Mrs. F. Still flows the tide of my unhappiness; The stars shoot mischief, and each coming hour Is fatal to me! Fos. What's the matter now? Mrs. F. (C.) Your brother—your good brother, sir. Fos. (L. C.) What of him? He is again in Ludgate, I suppose. Mrs. F. No—he's in Highgate, sir—he struts it bravely!— Fos. Read me this riddle, wife! Brown. What mean you, madam? Mrs. F. He's married, forsooth! and married richly too. Fos. Married! why, where's the woman of repute Would choose so lightly? Mrs. F. A woman in whose breast I thought I'd lived—Who is it, think you, sirs? Nay, you'll not guess, though you should try a month. It is my gossip then,—the Widow Welsted— The wealthy widow of Cornhill! Fos. O, fie! fie!— 'Tis fabulous! Brown. [Aside.] By'r lady I'm glad on't. Mrs. F. Are you my husband?—then is she his wife! Nay more—within this hour hath he been chosen Sheriff of London for th'ensuing year! Fos., Brown. Sheriff of London! Mrs. F. Aye—You may well stare. But money can work miracles, and now He's store of it—A proper Sheriff!—Oh!— How will this upstart beggar shoulder now And take the wall of you—His new-found pride Will know no bounds. Fos. A miracle indeed!— But wife, my wealth will five times double his Ere this tide ebb.—I wonder I yet hear not The brazen cannon tell the loud arrival Of my vast substance. Mrs. F. Beggars will be proud Of little, sir, and shoulder at the best. Fos. Let him first pay his old score and then reckon; But that she— Mrs. F. Aye, there's where it mads me too. Would any woman, unless to spite herself, So much profane the sacred name of wedlock!— A dove to couple with a stork! Brown. He comes. [Foster and Mrs. F. retire up the Stage. Enter Stephen and Robert, R. Steph. [To Brown.] Save you, good sir, I have some business with you. Brown. With me, sir?—You're most welcome. Mrs. F. See you, sir. [They come down on L. He will not know you now. Jockey's a gentleman! Fos. Well fare rich widows when such beggars flourish! Steph. (R. C.) Ha! ha! ha! ha! Mrs. F. Look! look! he laughs at you! Fos. No wonder, woman, he did that in Ludgate. But 'twas when his kind nephew did relieve him— Robert kneels to his Father, C. Why, how now? What Idol kneels that heretic to? Steph. Rise, boy! Rise up, I say! Thou'rt now my son, and owest No knee to that unnatural old man. Proud sir, this son, whom you have alienated For my love's sake, shall now, by my love's bounty, Ride side by side with the best equipage, Your scorns dare pattern him. Fos. A beggar's gallop Now up, now down. Steph. [To Brown.] My business is with you, sir. I am now furnishing some shipping forth, And want some English traffic, broad-cloth, kerseys, Or such like. If you can supply me, sir, I am your chapman. Brown. That I'll soon resolve you. Re-enter George, L. Come hither, George. [Talks aside. Fos. (R.) That's the rich merchantman! Mrs. F. The new made sheriff, just come out of jail! Brown. [To George.] Good—[To Stephen.] Sir, I can furnish you, my factor tells me, With wares this moment from your brother brought. Please you go see them, for I'd fain divide you, Since I can win no nearer friendship. Steph. Sir, I follow you— [Exeunt Stephen, Brown, and George, L. Fos. Take your adoption with you! Rob. I do but crave your blessing. Fos. 'Tis my curse then! Get from mine eye, thou art a beam in 't, I'll tear it out, ere it shall look on thee. Away, I say! Mrs. F. (R. C.) Follow thine uncle-father. [Exit Robert, L. Fos. (C.) Thy gossip's folly bears its punishment. He'll make the wealthy widow a poor wife. But see where Richard comes in haste; now, listen, And hear me crowned the wealthiest London merchant. Enter Richard, L. Now, Richard, now—why are those cannon dumb? Mine ears are strained to catch the joyful sound. Hast thou not seen the gunner?—Richard! Knave! Wherefore dost look so sadly?—Speak, man, speak; Hast thou thy tongue? Rich. (L.) I never could speak worse; It is a screech owl's note. Oh, you have made The most unhappy bargain. Fos. Ha! what meanest thou? What can so baleful be as thou dost seem To hint by this sad prologue?—I'm no traitor, To confiscate my goods—speak, and speak quickly. Rich. Would you could guess at it, and spare the tale. Fos. Dally not with thy torments! Sink me at once! Rich. Now 'tis half said. 'Tis sinking I must treat of! Your ships are sunk! Fos. Hah! Mrs. F. Raven as thou art? [Darting at him. I'll tear thy tongue out for that croak! Fos. [Catching hold of her.] Fool, he but jests! It is impossible. My ships were riding in full pride at Dover; What English Scylla could the devil raise To wreck them so near home? Ha! ha! But, Richard, 'Tis ill to jest in such a case as this. I pray thee, Richard—I— Rich. Alack! alack! E'en in the mouth and entrance of the Thames They were all cast away! Fos. My ships! Rich. All! all! Fos. My ships! no, no, no, no,—'tis false! Thou liest! Confess thou dost or die! What! cast away! All lost! Rich. Some men were saved, but not one bale of goods. Fos. Talk not to me of men! my wealth! my wealth! Did they not shame to breathe when all was gone? O, that I had but perish'd with my store, Not lived to hear its loss! Open thou earth! And gulph me as the greedy sea hath done My fickle fortunes! In the fatal stream, Whose mouth rejected them, may serpents breed And poison it for ever! [Runs R.—returns. Mrs. F. (L.) Wretch! on thee Shall all my vengeance turn. Ungodly slave! Thou art the mark unto the wrath of heaven! I thrived ere I knew thee. Fos. (C.) Would I were dead! Mrs. F. Would thou hadst died ere ever I had seen thee! For I have known no hour of comfort since. Rich. Not even a cask or chest— Fos. Dam up thy mouth! But now thy baleful utterance was choak'd, And now it runs too fast!—Undone!—Undone! Ruin'd past hope!—my utmost credit strain'd To buy a venture which the waves have drunk!— What worse can woe report? Mrs. F. Yes, worse than all— Our enemies will triumph in our fall! [Richard goes up the Stage. Fos. The place that I assign'd my thriftless brother, Ludgate, must now be mine.—I scorn'd my child!— Now he may scorn his father! Mrs. F. Scorn him still?— Fos. I will—I will—would he my wants relieve, I'd scorn to take what he would deign to give. My heart be still my friend, although no other, No help will I from either, son or brother! My portion's begging now! seldom before In one sad hour was man so rich and poor! [Exeunt, L. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —Walter Brown's Garden. Enter Jane and Sir Godfrey, hand in hand, and Master Lambskin following, R. Jane. (R. C.) Gentlemen, my father's not within: please you to walk a turn or two here in the garden, he'll not be long. Lambs. (C.) Your father, Mistress Jane,—Dear heart!—I hope you think not we come a-wooing to your father. Sir G. (C.) A truce to your folly. [Jane retires up the Stage.] Thou art all innocence, and thy name is Lambskin.—The wench cares not a pin for thy squibs and crackers—My old dry wood shall be a lusty bonfire, when thy green chips lie hissing in the chimney corner. Lambs. I pray thee do not stand troubling the gentlewoman with thy musty sentences, but, let her love be laid down betwixt us like a pair of cudgels, and into whose hands she thrusts them first let him take up the bucklers. [She comes down, L. Sir G. (C.) A match between us! Lambs. (R. C.) Lady, you must tell us who most deserves your favor. Jane. But will you stand by my decision? Lambs. Else may I never stand but in the pillory. Jane. (C.) You love me, both, you say? Lambs. I do, by this hand! Sir G. Hand! Zounds! by the four-and-twenty elements! Jane. Pray spare your oaths, I do believe you do, Or else you would not make this stir to woo me. It cannot be, I'm sure, for what I have. I will not wrong you by such foul suspicion. You look not like such money-traps—besides You're rich, Sir Godfrey—or at least you say so. What then, you're but a gilded piece of clay! Lambs. [Aside.] (L. C.) A piece of gingerbread—I could find it in my heart to eat him! Jane. Should I wed you—the fire with frost would marry Winter and spring—I, for a younger tarry— [Sir Godfrey retires up the Stage. Lambs. That's I—In troth I'll be thy young Lambskin; thou shalt find me as innocent as a sucking dove. Speak, sweet mistress—am I the youth in a basket? Jane. You must be wiser ere you win my love. Sir G. Ah! ha! Is your coxcomb cut? 'Tis I must board this pinnace. [Comes down C. Lady, a word in private— [Both C. Lambs. Nay, I'll have no words in private unless I hear too— [They retire up the Stage disputing Enter Brown, Stephen Foster, and Robert. Robert stands R. Brown. Come, gentlemen, we'll make few words about it. The broad cloths, wools, and such commodities, I lately from your brother bought, are yours. [To Stephen Foster. Steph. (C.) 'Tis well. [Sir Godfrey and Lambskin urge their respective suit to Jane in the back ground. Brown. (L. C.) Then be not angry, Master Sheriff, If now a string be touch'd which hath too long Sounded so harshly over all the city. Steph. Good Master Brown, I greatly fear that string Will still offend mine ear—you mean the jarring Betwixt me and my brother? Brown. Sir, I do. Steph. I hate no poison, like that brother's name! Uncivil churl! when all his sails were up, And that his proud heart danced on golden waves— Brown. As, Heav'n be thank'd, it still does. Steph. Yet, sir, then, I being well nigh sunk in misery, He would not cast out a poor line of thread To bring me to the shore—I might have drown'd And died for him! Brown. A better fate, good sir, Stood at your elbow. Steph. Aye, sir, this was he, [Taking Robert by the hand. That lifted me from want and wretchedness. Whose cruel father hath, for that kind act, Cast him away, scorning his name and blood; Lopp'd from his side this branch that held me dear, For which he's now my son, my joy, my heir. But for his father! Hang him! Brown. Fie! Steph. By Heav'n! Brown. Live in more charity—he is your brother: Well—if his name offend—I'll say no more— Yonder's my daughter busy with her suitors; We'll speak with them. Bid your friends welcome, Jane, Jane. They must be welcome, sir, that come with you. [Aside to Rob.] To thee ten thousand welcomes. Rob. [Kissing her hand.] My sweet mistress. [Goes up the Stage. Lamb. [Aside to Sir Godfrey, R.] Eh! Why, Sir Knight, we've stood beating the bush, and the bird's flown away. Yon city bowler hath kiss'd the mistress at first cast. Brown. (C.) How fare you, gentlemen? What cheer, Sir Knight? Sir G. An adventurer still, sir, to this new found land. Lamb. We sail about the point, sir. Brown. You'd best cast anchor, or the wind may change. A word, Master Sheriff. [They converse apart. Lamb. [Aside to Sir Godfrey.] You see, Sir Godfrey, what card has turn'd up for trump. I'll lay my life this spruce citizen will forestall the market. Sir G. An' he play the merchant with us, Master Lambskin, I'll cut off's ears. Lamb. Marry, and I would fain see you do that, Sir Godfrey. That would be rare sport! Sir G. Thou shalt see it, by my knighthood! Brown. [Aside to Stephen, L.] They are both suitors, sir, yet both shoot wide. My daughter must be your nephew's. Steph. I'll give her a wedding ring on that condition, and put a stone in it with a thousand pounds, sir. Brown. You have my hand and heart to't; be she pleas'd too. Lamb. [Aside to Sir Godfrey, R.] Let us show ourselves gallants, Sir Godfrey. Shall we be out-faced by a cockney? [Aloud to Robert.] Look you, sir. Rob. Well, sir! [Comes down, C. Lamb. I beseech you to observe, while you angle for maids, here be those who have gone fishing, and can give you a gudgeon. Rob. (C.) I would not require a greater one than yourself, sir. But you had best go fish for better manners, or I shall bob for eels with you. Lamb. Sir, let me tell you— Rob. Do you prate, poppinjay?—Take that! [Strikes him—returns to Jane. Lamb. Zounds! are you a striker? Draw, Sir Knight! Cut off his ears! [Runs behind Sir Godfrey. Brown. Not in my garden. Pray be quiet, gentlemen. Rob. He dares not do't, believe me, sir. Steph. Now by my soul, my boy, for this brave spirit, I'll hug thee in my arms. Lose life and limbs, Ere thou forsake thy love! Lamb. Sir, he has struck me, and I'm a gentleman— Sir G. And hear you, sir—let him seek out his equals, for some of us are in danger to make that damsel a lady shortly. I know what I speak, and what I speak I'll do. Steph. Speak what you please, sir; he's a gentleman As good as either of you. Aye, and shall, In list of love for such a bed-fellow, Brave him who dares; or here lay down more gold (If that may win her love), than you're both worth. Sir G. Ah! Do you know us, sir? You grow too bold. I know you now: you were once a tatter'd fellow, and your name is Foster. Have you such gold to give? Lamb. Yes, yes, he has won it at bowls, or at the pigeon-holes, or the garden-alleys. Steph. (C.) Ye muddy grooms, who dare upbraid me thus With follies which my virtue now gilds over, What are your names? Lamb. (C.) Our names are in the Herald's books, sir, I warrant you. My name is Master Innocent Lambskin, and this knight, though he stand simply here, is known to be Sir Godfrey Speedwell. Steph. (L. C.) Lambskin and Speedwell! Ah, ha! Is it so? [Pulls out a parchment. Very good, sir. My little Lambskin (C.) I Have you in Sheep-skin here. And you, Sir Knight, too. Look, Master Brown, these two crack'd blusterers Are bound in several deeds to my wife's first husband For debts of full two thousand pounds a-piece. Go, cousin—fetch a sergeant straight. Rob. Yes, sir. [Pretends to go. Sir G. A sergeant! [Aside.] Nay, then, legs be strong and bold.—I'll shift for one. [Exit Sir Godfrey running, R. Lamb. [Feeling behind him.] Knight! Knight! [Turns and misses him.—Aside.] Mass! If an errant knight run away, I were an errant ass to tarry. I love the wench well—but a sergeant!—I—I'll begone and leave them, that's flat. [Exit Lamb., R. Brown. Ha! ha! You've scared the archers from their mark, sir. [Rob. and Jane come down on R. Steph. I'm glad on't, Master Brown—they did but seek To build their state on you, and with your wealth To under-prop their weakness. Jane. See—your wife, sir. Enter Mrs. Stephen Foster, L. Brown. The city's wonder! Fortune's favourite! The happy woman who was never vex'd! You're welcome, Mrs. Foster. Mrs. S. (L.) I thank you. Steph. Wife, your two debtors were this moment here— Speedwell and Lambskin. By my holy dame! A wolf could not have scared poor Lambskin worse Than the bare name of sergeant. The mere thought Made them both take their heels and run away! Mrs. S. Alas! they're poor and lean—and being so— Kill them not till they're fatter. Steph. As you will. For at thy girdle, sweet, do hang the keys To lock the prison doors or let them loose. 'Twas my intent, only in way of mirth, To drive them from the presence of this lady, That our adopted son might have no bar Unto his love. Mrs. S. [To Jane, crossing to her.] Sweetheart, we must be friends And kinswomen. The happy knot once tied, I'll send some angels to attend the bride. Enter George, L. Jane. [To Brown.] Your factor, sir. Brown. Are the wares ready, George? George. Yes, and deliver'd, sir, unto the servants Of yonder gentleman. [Pointing to Stephen.] But going with them I met ill news. Brown. Ill news! What is it, George? George. Old Master Foster's ships, so richly laden, By strange misfortunes, sir, are cast away. Brown. Now Heav'n forbid! Rob. Alas! Steph. How? cast away! Brown. Impossible! They rid at Dover safe, When he out-bought my int'rest in the fraught, And paid me down full twenty thousand pounds In wares and money. George. Sir, it is too true. By Master Foster's own command, they weigh'd Their anchors up, and so to come for London; But by a merciless storm they all were swallowed, E'en in the mouth of Thames. The men were saved, But all the goods were lost. Rob. Oh, my poor father! This loss, I fear, will be his utter ruin. Steph. Ha! What is that to you?—If in my favour You'd still sit warm, bury all love to him. Nay, duty: hear you, sir?—What! shed'st thou tears For him, who had no care to see thy heart Drop blood—He was unnatural, and Heav'n Hath justly now rewarded him. [Crosses to L. Brown. (L.) Most strange! He needs would buy my part at any rate, And now all's lost! Steph. He would have swallow'd all [Returns to C. And now is swallow'd—Sir, 'tis but his hire, And I'll not pity it, no more than he, In his abundance, did my misery. Mrs. S. I grieve for my old gossip, his poor wife; She never met good fortune all her days, And this will break her heart-strings.—In good sooth I'll go and comfort her. Steph. In good sooth you shall not— Nor him, nor her, at this time, gentle wife. He scorn'd me in his height, now being fallen, If that he need my help, he knows my door. Sir, [To Brown] Fare you well: at fitter leisure we Will have this marriage talk'd of. Brown. As you please. Steph. Come, wife. Go not to see your father, sir. [To Robert. I charge you [To Brown] do not stir. Brown. You'll pardon me, I'll see you to the gate. [Exeunt Brown, Stephen, Mrs. S., and George, L. Rob. (C.) Sweet love, adieu! Jane. (R.) Whate'er befal I fear not—rest thou true! Rob. Then uncle, an' thou wilt bar up thy door, I'll help my father, though myself grow poor! [Exeunt Jane, R. and Robert, L. SCENE II. —Exterior of the Prison of Ludgate. Enter Old Foster and Richard, R. Rich. (C.) Good sir, resolve not thus—return again, Your debts are not so great that you should yield Your body thus to prison, unconstrain'd. Fos. (L. C.) I will not trust the iron hearts of men. My credit's lost!—my wealth the sea hath swallow'd, Wreck'd at my door, even in the mouth o'the Thames! Oh, my misfortune!—Never man like me Was so thrown down and cast to wretchedness! Rich. Dear sir, be patient. Fos. Prithee, get thee gone, And with thy diligence assist thy mistress To keep what little's left to help herself; Whilst here in Ludgate I secure my body From writs, arrests, and executions, which Full well I know, my cruel creditors Will thunder on me. Go, go—get thee gone; If what is left they'll take, do thou agree; If not, I have resolv'd, stay here and die! Rich. I'll do my best, sir, to procure your peace— [Foster rings the prison bell.] [Exit Rich., R. Enter Keeper from Prison. Fos. [To Keeper.] Come, sir, I yield myself your prisoner: you are the keeper of this Ludgate. Keeper. Yes, sir. Fos. I pray thee, bar me of no privilege Due to a citizen.—Thou know'st me well? Keeper. Yes, Master Foster, and I grieve your losses; Yet doubt not but your son and brother— Fos. Ha! Speak not of them, man!—Do not kiss and kill me!— I have no son nor brother who esteems me, And I for ever hate their memory! Prithee, no more, good friend; I am come sick To a bad inn, and look for poor attendance. I've ta'en a surfeit of misfortunes, and Must swallow pills with poison to re-cure me. I'm sea-sick, sir; and heave my hands to Heaven!— Ne'er to so low an ebb was Foster driven! Keeper. There be some fees to pay, sir. Fos. So, so, so.— If this old walnut-tree, after such cudgelling, Have but one cluster left, thou shalt have that too. If not, take off these leaves that cover me, Pull off these white locks—rend them from my head, And let them in my woes be buried. Keeper. Sir, This house is poor, alas! Fos. I do not doubt it— Well—well—What book must I read over now? What servile oar must I be tied to here, Slave like, to tug within this Christian galley? Keeper. Sir, being the latest-enter'd prisoner, You must beg at the iron-grate within, As others do, for your relief and theirs. Fos. Well, for a beggar 'tis no shame to beg; And for the iron-grate, it bears an emblem Of iron-hearted creditors, who force Their fellow-men to starve and die in prisons. [Keeper retires back. Enter Robert, R. O torment of my soul!—what mak'st thou here! Cannot the picture of my misery Be drawn and hung out to the eyes of men, But thou must come to scorn and laugh at it? Rob. (R. C.) Dear sir, believe I come to thrust my back Under your load, to make the burden lighter. Fos. (C.) Hence from my sight—Dissembling villain, hence! Thine uncle sends defiance to my woe, And thou must bear it—Hence thou basilisk, That kill'st me with thine eyes! Rob. Alas! I come In natural duty, sir, to beg your blessing. And for mine uncle— Fos. Him and thee I curse!— I'll die ere I eat bread from out the hand Of either—Hence, I say!—And tell that cur, Thy barking uncle, that I lie not here Upon the bed of riot, as he did, Cover'd with all the villainies which man Had ever woven:—tell him I lie not so. It was the hand of Heav'n struck me down, And I do bless it!—Get thee gone, I say. Or, if thou'lt laugh thy fill at my poor state, Then stay, and hear thy father—an old man Who yesterday had thousands, beg, and cry To get a penny! Rob. Sir, for pity hear me!— Fos. Keeper, away!—[To Rob.] I charge thee come no nearer— I'll be no father to so vile a son. [Exeunt Foster and Keeper into Prison, in the back ground. Rob. (C.) Alas! why am I paid for good, with hate. From this sad place of Ludgate here, I freed An uncle, and I lost a father for it. Now is my father here, whom if I succour I lose that uncle's love!—Oh! misery, How bitter is thy taste!—Yet I will drink Thy strongest poison: fret what mischief can, I'll feed my father, though like the pelican I peck my own breast for him. [Puts money in the box. Ah!—mine uncle!— Enter Stephen Foster, R. Steph. (C.) Now, sir, what make you here, so near the prison? Rob. I pray you pardon—I was going, sir, To buy meat for a poor bird that I have, That sits so sadly in his cage of late, I think he'll die for sorrow— Steph. Aye, indeed— I fear me I shall find that bird to be That churlish wretch thy father, who hath taken Shelter in Ludgate here—Sir, urge me not! Go not you near him if you'd have my love. I give you warning, sir. Rob. Alas! good uncle! You know, when you lay here, I succour'd you, So let me now help him. Steph. Yes, as he helped me, You freed me with his gold, but 'gainst his will. For him I might have rotted, starv'd, and so Shall he do now. Fos. [Within.] Some charitable man Remember the poor prisoners! Rob. O, sir! listen! 'Tis my poor father's voice! [Attempts to cross. Steph. [Stopping him.] There let him howl! Begone, and come not near him! Rob. O, my soul! What tortures dost thou feel? Earth ne'er shall find A son so true, yet forced to be unkind! [Exit Robert, R. Steph. Well, go thy way, thou pattern of true virtue! My heart is full, I could scarce keep from tears To hear a brother begging in a prison, Who but ere while spread up a lofty sail As proudly as the best. Oh! 'twere a sin Unpardonable not to succour him, But I will do it closely, for I know That he would scorn assistance at my hands In's present mood. He shall not know from whence His comforts come. [Knocks at the gate.] What ho! within there, keeper! Enter Keeper. Keeper. Your pleasure, sir. Steph. Who's he begs at the gate? Keeper. (C.) One master Foster, a decay'd citizen, But new come in. I cry you mercy, sir, You know him better than myself, I think. Steph. (C.) I should do, knew he me as I would have him. Pray take him from the grate, and that he stand No more at it to beg. There are ten pounds To pay his fees and take off all his wants. If he demands who sends it, tell him 'tis Thine own free hand to lend him so much money. Spend what he will, my purse shall pay for all, And at his parting hence, which shall be soon, The poorest prisoner that lives in Ludgate, Shall bless his coming in: I'll for his sake Do something now, that while this city stands Shall keep the Foster's name engraven so high, As no black storm shall cloud its memory. [Exit, L. Keeper. Heav'n bless your purpose, sir. I shall be mindful. [Exit into the Prison. SCENE III. —Apartment at Stephen Foster's. Enter Mrs. Foster and Mrs. Stephen Foster, R. Mrs. Steph. (C.) Sister, there's no way to make sorrow light But in the noble bearing; be content, Blows given from Heav'n are our due punishment. All shipwrecks are not drownings: you see buildings Made fairer from their ruins; he that I married, The brother to your husband, laid, you know, On the same bed of misery: yet now He's rank'd with the best citizens. Mrs. F. (C.) Oh, you Were born to wealth and happiness, but I To want and scorn. Mrs. Steph. Nay, hush this useless grief, And I will move my husband. Enter Clown, L. Now, your business?— Clown. (L.) Marry, mistress, there are two creatures below would speak with you— Mrs. Steph. What are they?—learn their titles— Clown. That I have already, the one is a thing that was pluck'd into the world by the head and shoulders to be wonder'd at, and 'tis called a Knight—the other is a coach horse of the same overridden race, and that's a foolish gentleman. Mrs. Steph. O, they're my debtors, Speedwell and Lambskin. Go call them in. [Exit Clown, L. And you, my gentle sister, Comfort yourself and my imprisoned brother, What good I can, I'll do for him—be bold. Mrs. F. May heavenly blessings guard you—Never woman was vex'd as I am still. [Exit Mrs. Foster, R. Re-enter Clown, L. Clown. They are coming up, mistress, and my master with them. Enter Stephen, Robert, Lambskin, and Sir Godfrey, L. Steph. (C.) So, sirs, you cannot pay the whole, you say. What present money do you come to offer? Sir God. (L.) I can put down about two hundred pounds. Lambs. (L.) So can I too, and take up seven times as much—if I knew where to get it—but that's my lamentable case. If you strip me any nearer, you shall strip skin and all, I promise you. Mrs. Steph. (C.) We'll sheer no sheep so close—[To Steph.] Good sweetheart, say—shall it be put to me?— Steph. Do as you please. In all thy deeds thou'rt govern'd by good stars; Therefore, if thou cry'st peace—why peace be with them. E'en order it as thou wilt. Mrs. Steph. I thank you, sir. All your two thousand pounds then we will quit For your two hundred each—pay to my coz The money, and receive your cancell'd bonds. Both. Now Heav'n be with you, lady— Steph. Cousin [To Rob.] go. Receive their money—and sirrah [To Clown.] make them drink— Rob. Follow me, gentlemen. [Exeunt Robert, Sir Godfrey and Lambskin, L. Clown. (L.) I'll make 'em drink if they will—They shall empty their purses, and I'll fill their stomachs. Marry, an' that will be no easy task with the Knight; but as for the lean gentleman, it's a question whether he hath a stomach to fill.—Heav'n send he pass not the doghouse! Jowler hath a keen nose for carrion!— [Exit Clown, L. Steph. How now, sweet wife—what art thou musing on? Mrs. Steph. I must come wooing to you, sir. Steph. For what?— Mrs. Steph. For your poor brother, sir,—O 'tis unmeet, For souls framed by one square to grow uneven; 'Tis like a war 'mongst the great lights of Heaven, One cannot lose his beauty, but the other Suffers eclipse. Steph. Thy songs are angel tunes, And on thy wings I'll fly with thee to Heaven. Thou speak'st as I would have thee, dearest wife!— His debts I've justly weigh'd and found them light, But I of purpose keep aloof to try My kinsman, Robert, whom I spied but now Hovering about the grate whare his poor father With piteous voice ask'd charity.—I chid, And rail'd against the boy—but my heart leap'd To see such goodness in a son—I'll wager That the four hundred pounds paid by these fellows Will by our coz be given to his father. Mrs. Steph. Troth, would it might! Enter Brown, L. Brown. Where's Master Stephen Foster?— Oh, you are here, sir, you must hence with speed— The city officers stay at Guildhall, And need your aid, as sheriff, to make order— Touching the entertainment of the King, Who will to-morrow dine with the new Mayor On his return from Westminster. Steph. I thank you— Come—to the Guildhall.—Wife, look to our kinsman.— Let me know all his steps, but do not hinder him, If he relieve his father—Sir, have with you.— [Exeunt Mrs. Foster, R. Stephen and Brown, L. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. —A Chamber in Ludgate. Old Foster discovered with Mrs. Foster, sitting at a Table, the Keeper attending on R. Keeper. Come, come, be merry, sir; do as mourners do at funerals, wear your hat in your eyes, and laugh in your heart. Fos. I've no fat legacy left me, To teach me how to play the hypocrite. Keeper. No? Why, look ye, sir; you shall want neither meat, drink, nor anything this house affords; or if anything abroad, here's money, send for what you will, sir; nay, you shall beg no more at the grate neither. Fos. Ha! Is not this Ludgate? Keeper. Yes, sir. Fos. A jail, a prison, a tomb of men lock'd up, Alive and buried? Keeper. 'Tis what you please to call it. Fos. Oh, at what crevice then hath comfort crept Like a bright sunbeam in? For all the doors And windows are of iron bar'd to keep Her out! [Rises and comes forward.] I had a limb cut from my body Dear as my life! I had a son and brother! O, grief! They both would give me poison now, Before their hollow palms ten drops should hold Of nature's drink, cold water, but to save My life one minute? Whence should pity come then? Keeper. No matter, sir; since you have good meat set before you, never ask who sent it. If heaven provide for you, and make the fowls of the air your caterers, feed you fat and be thankful, and so I leave you. [Exit Keeper, R. Mrs. F. The keeper is your friend, and pours true balm Into your smarting wounds; be patient, husband. Fos. (L. C.) Oh wife! [She rises.] My looses are as numberless As the sea sands that swallow'd them, and I, By reck'ning them, my sad griefs multiply! Enter Robert, R. Ha! what art thou? Call for the keeper there! And thrust him out of doors, or lock me up! Mrs. F. (C.) It is your son, sir. Fos. Son! I know him not. [Robert kneels, R. C. I am no king, unless of scorn and woe! Why dost thou kneel to me? Rob. Oh, my dear father! I come not like a storm t'increase your wreck, But to take all the sorrows from your back, And lay them on mine own. Fos. Up, mischief, up?— Away, and get thee gone!—My heart still hates thee! Mrs. F. Sweet husband!— Fos. Hence, thou villain!—Keeper!—Ho! Rob. Good sir, I'm gone. I will not stay to grieve you. Oh, knew you for your woes what pains I feel, You would not scorn me so. See, sir, to cool Your burning heat of sorrow, I have brought Four hundred pounds, and joy it is my lot To lay it down with reverence at your feet. [Producing a bag of money. Fos. Am I awake! Rob. No comfort in this world To me is sweet, while thus you live in moan: Take it, dear father, and farewell. [Rises and going R. Fos. Stay!—Stay!—[He stops.] I see mine error now. Oh! can there grow A rose upon a bramble? In one tide Poison and health together flow. Alas! What have I done? Forgive me, my good child! [Kneels.] Look—on my knees I beg it. Not for joy Thou bring'st this golden rubbish, which I spurn, But that kind heav'n hath torn away the veil That scarf'd mine eyes up!—Oh, my dear wrong'd son! Rob. Gladness o'erwhelms my heart. I cannot speak. Rise, sir, pray rise!— [He rises and they embrace. Mrs. F. Oh, happy, happy sight! [Crosses to L. Fos. Yet, wife, I disinherited this boy!— Rob. Speak not of that, sir—let me have your blessing. Fos. For evermore, what blessing can Repay such duty? Enter Keeper, R. Keeper. Master Foster—the new sheriff, your brother, is come to Ludgate, and I hasten to know your pleasure, if you would see him. Fos. I'll see a fury first! clap-to the door!— Rob. Father, let's fly the thunder of his rage! Enter Stephen Foster as Sheriff, attended, R. Steph. (R.) Now, where's the keeper? Go, sir, take my officers, And see your prisoners presently convey'd From Ludgate unto Newgate, and the Computer.— How now! What mak'st thou here, thou caitiff? ha! [To Rob. Comest thou to heal his wounds that seeks to cut My throat?—and in despite relieve this dotard?— Fos. (L.) Get from my sight!—comest thou in scarlet pride To tread on thy poor brother in a jail? Is there but one small fountain that doth run Cold water to my comfort, and would'st thou Stop that, thou cruel man?— Steph. (R. C.) Aye, sir, I would! When drops but fell on me, you poison'd them, And thrust a son's name from thy cruel breast For feeding of his uncle; now that uncle Shall thrust him starving forth for feeding thee! Where is my money, knave? [To Rob.] Four hundred pounds Received so lately by you from my debtors? Rob. (L. C.) Gone, uncle. Steph. Gone! Rob. But not at dice, or drinking. Steph. This, thou shalt answer, villain?— [Threatens to strike Robert, Foster throws himself between them. Fos. Would'st thou strike? Wound me then, that will kill thee if I can! Steph. Thou rav'st!— Fos. How can I chuse?—Thou mak'st me mad!— Art thou not sham'd to look on these white hairs? Churl, beat not my poor boy!—let him not lose Thy love for my sake—see—see—here's thy gold— Tell it—none's stolen— [Mrs. F. crosses in the back ground to R. Steph. Officer—do your duty. Arrest that youth. Rob. Dear uncle!— Mrs. F. (R.) Gentle brother!— Steph. I'm deaf. Fos. Fiend!—Tiger!— Steph. You will repent this language— Keeper, away with them out of my sight, And do, sir, as I charg'd you— Keeper. Sir, I will. Fos. Poor tyranny when lions weak lambs kill! [Keeper and Officers force out Foster and Robert, followed by Mrs. Foster, R. Steph. (C.) I'm glad they're gone. Mine eyes with rain swell'd high. The keeper knows my mind. Enter Mrs. Stephen Foster, R. Well, wife, I've paid My brother's debts, and when he's out of door, To march to Newgate, he shall be set free. Mrs. S. But for your cousin, sir. Steph. Fear not for him. The boy shall not be injured for more wealth Than London gates lock safe up every night. Mrs. S. But why remove the prisoners from Ludgate? Steph. To take the prison down, and build it new, With leads to walk on, chambers large and fair; For when myself lay here, the noxious air Choked up my spirits. None but captives, wife, Can know what captives feel. Mrs. S. 'Tis a good deed; And in it I'll walk, hand in hand, with you. Close to the gate there stands a tenement That was my father's; take it down, and add So much ground to the work. Steph. 'Tis fairly given, Thy soul on prisoners' pray'rs shall mount to Heav'n. But I must haste To join the Mayor and citizens. Come, wife— I count this day the happiest of my life. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —Exterior of the Prison, as before. Enter Foster, Mrs. Foster, Robert, and Officers, from the Prison Door in the back ground. Fos. (R. C.) How? Free! Officer. (R.) As air, sir. Fos. You do mock me, surely! My creditors— Officer. Are satisfied. Fos. By whom? Officer. I may not say; it must suffice you, sir, Your debts are paid, and you at liberty. Fos. Then let us hence, my son, and— Officer. Pardon me, But this young man is still my prisoner. You heard the Sheriff's charge. Fos. Thy prisoner! Then tell me not I am at liberty! My child—my own true boy—I will not leave him; One dungeon shall contain us; 'twas for me He dared the anger of that cruel Sheriff, And I will suffer with him—so lead on, sir. Officer. I dare not let you bear him company: You must part here. He goes to Newgate straight. Rob. (L. C.) Adieu, dear father. Hie thee home—be happy— My uncle will relent and— Fos. Never! Never! He knows not pity. You have been the footstool Of his new fortunes; and now, like a footstool, He spurns you from him! But I'll do some deed Shall force him lodge me in the same dark den. [Trumpets without. Ha! Excellent! He's riding now through London In all the pomp of his new dignity. I'll beard him in his pride!—Before his officers, I'the face of the whole city, will I cry Shame on him! Mrs. F. (L.) Husband! pray thee, patience! Officer. Hold, sir!— You know not what you do. The King himself Returns from Westminster with the procession To dine with the new Mayor, and should your boldness— Fos. The King! The King! Why, better still! The King Shall hear and judge between us! He is bound To do all justice! At his feet I'll fall, And shame the Sheriff in his own proud Hall! [Rushes out, L. Rob. [To Officer.] I pray thee, good friend, let us follow him; His griefs have made him mad; in his despair He will do some rash act will bring dishonour On his grey hairs! Pray let us follow him. Officer. [Aside.] Perhaps 'twere best so. [Aloud. Well, have with you, sir. [Exeunt hastily. SCENE III. —Cheapside. The Lord Mayor's Show, as it appeared in the 15th century.

O welcome is all love. Our people's shouts, In their heart's language, make our benvenues Most high and sovereign. We return all thanks Unto our loving subjects. Fos. [Without.] Away!— I'll speak to the King! King H. How now? What means that cry? Steph. [Aside, R. C.] My brother's voice! King H. Give room and let them pass! We are accessible to all our subjects, But most of all to the unfortunate! Enter Foster, L. hastily followed by Mrs. Foster, Robert, and Officers. Jane. [R. Aside.] Robert a prisoner! Mrs. S. [R. Aside.] Fear not, all is well. Steph. [Aside.] I could have spared a public explanation; But be it so, since 'tis so. King H. Now, sirs, what would ye? Fos. [L. Kneeling.] Mercy, great King!—Most pious Henry, mercy! And judgment 'twixt us and that Sheriff there! King H. Old man, what is thy grief? Speak on—we hear. Rob. [L. Kneeling.] I am the suppliant plaintiff, Royal Henry; Hear me, I do beseech you! King H. What art thou? Rob. I was the son of this distressed father, Until he took off his paternity And threw me from his love; then I became Son to mine uncle, yonder, by adoption, Who likewise that hath ta'en away again, And thrown me back to poverty: No son Was ever tost betwixt two fathers thus, For still the richest doth despise his heir— King H. This may your vices cause— Fos. Most gracious King!— Before I understood his virtuous mind, I did that forward work—yon now great man Was an unthrifty wretch, a prodigal then, And I disdain'd to know his brotherhood. Denied relief to him; this good, kind child, Against my contradiction did relieve him, And in my rage I threw away my son. Steph. The like plead I, my liege; for when my state Had rais'd itself by a most happy chance, I took this outcast child, made him my own— When, to my grief, he presently did prove A traitor to my trust—against my will Succouring that foe, whom I did hate so much Only for hating him. He cut large thongs Of that which was another's—underpropp'd A ruin'd house with timber not his own— And for that deed he suffers. King H. Hapless youth! You fall betwixt two pillars—is't not so? Rob. My father's hate, my liege, I might deserve,— I broke his precepts—to my uncle gave What was my father's—But that now mine uncle Should throw me from his love for the same deed Which, done for him, he did approve before, Beats sorest 'gainst my bosom—if 'twere good To rob a father for an uncle's food, In laws of love and nature, how much rather Might I abridge an uncle for a father! King. A fair and shrewd reply—why, master Sheriff— Steph. (R. C.) Oh, let me now anticipate your grace, And, casting off this shadow, show to all My heart's true figure. O, my royal liege, I have two jewels here shall never part From my love's eye-watch. This, my wife and son— Whom here, I do enfranchise, and enfold— [Embracing Robert. Now sir, to you I come—[To Foster] your debts are paid, There's not a creditor can ask you aught— And, for I know bare liberty is poor Without assistance, your estate to raise, The third of mine is yours—say you amen. [To his Wife. Mrs. Steph. No—not to that—you are kind brothers now, Divide by halves in wealth as in affliction. Steph. So let it be—To Foster.] half my estate is yours. Fos. Oh, let my shame, my bosom's centre, break! [Embrace. Forget this moment my forgetful hours! Steph. Sir, they are buried all. [Embraces Foster and his Wife. King H. You bless our sight With objects that become the eyes of kings To look on. Mrs. Fos. [To Steph.] Dearest brother! Steph. O, my liege, There's now a matchless wonder in your sight. [Taking Mrs. Stephen's hand. King H. For beauty, sheriff, I suppose you mean. Steph. My liege, I would not so boast my own wife. King H. What is it then, I pr'ythee? Steph. Patience, sire; This is a woman that was never vex'd. King H. You may boast largely, 'tis a subject's happiness Above a monarch's; you've a prizeless jewel. Steph. I've many, my good liege; a wife, a brother, And this good son, for whom even with his father I would have striven. Fos. I give him to you now. Steph. I take him, sir, and to him back do give All that myself shall leave of state behind. Fos. And all that you gave me I do bestow; So he is heir to two. Brown. (R. C.) To three, good sir, For he is heir to me by this bond's virtue. [Pointing to Jane. Jane. I will not have him, sir, on such conditions. Rob. Nay, you shall have my love to boot, sweet Jane. Fairest and best! accept my hand and heart, Tied in a true love knot, never to part. Jane. (R.) Ay, marry sir, these are much better terms Than the inheritance of twenty fathers; I'll have you now, soon as the Priest can join us, Let him read as fast as he can. King H. A King Shall give her to thee, gentle youth, for ne'er Could royal hands bestow a gift more fair. Now to your feast—We'll hear this tale again, Whose records do deserve a brazen pen, And this above the rest, in golden text To be insculp'd—A woman never vext. [Flourish—Shout—The Curtain falls on the Picture. THE END.</field>
