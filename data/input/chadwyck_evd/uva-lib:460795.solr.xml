      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene First. —Grotto and Fountain (Moonlight). Enter Nigretta (Princess of Ethiopia), in a Chariot drawn by four Ostriches. Nig. (descending from chariot and advancing to fountain) Great Carabossa! mightiest of fairies, If as the story goes, your lodging there is, And by good fortune you should be at home, Rise at my call, for I have hither come Fast as four spanking ostriches can lay Their legs to ground, full gallop all the way, To crave, dear godmother, your prompt assistance. Oh, let me not in vain drive such a distance! Listen to thy unhappy godchild's voice, If in fresh water you would still rejoice, For the salt tears from these sad eyes now flowing Will turn to brine the sweetest fountain going. Music—A large Crab rises out of the water, it opens and discovers Fairy Carabossa. Cara. Behold me in obedience to your wishes. What, in the name of all the little fishes, Can be the matter, child? Good lack, good lack! Since you were born you never looked so black! Nig. I have no doubt—and you will say no wonder, When you have heard—that I look black as thunder. If you can't help me, poison or a cloister! I'm crossed in love worse than was ever oyster! You know young Felix, Prince of Happy Land, Sent an ambassador to crave my hand; All but concluded the negotiation— Cara. Of course the match had my full approbation. Nig. 'Tis broken off. Cara. And what the cause assigned? Nig. Merely the gentleman has changed his mind. Cara. And nothing more? Nig. Not one word good or bad; Oh! isn't it enough to drive one mad? Cara. Odd's fish! I'll soon the reason ferret out, There is a rival in the case no doubt. Nig. A rival! Deadly nightshade! Cara. Patience, daughter! In the pure crystal of this magic water We shall see what we shall see. Music—The form of the Princess Desiderata becomes visible in the fountain. Nig. Ha! behold her! I'll be revenged before I'm a week older. Cara. You shall, for she's the child of one I hate; Her mother slighted me, the base ingrate! I had almost forgotten the vile thing, But this new injury revives the sting. For twenty years my spell has o'er her been, Another week the end of it had seen; But since she has to you brought shame and sorrow, I'll pay off my old score with yours to-morrow. Nig. By death, with tortures? Cara. No, by life with greater Than you can dream of. Nig. And that faithless traitor, Prince Felix, shall not he be punished too? Cara. He shall, my child—I'll make him marry you. Nig. I ask no more—just let me be his wife, And he shall suffer for it all his life. Music—The fountain disappears with the Fairy Carabossa —Nigretta enters her chariot, and the scene gradually changes to Scene Second. —Point—Lace Chamber, Boudoir of the Princess Desiderata, in the Tower of Tapers. Princess Desiderata is discovered asleep on a couch or ottoman. Enter Floretta. Air—“Io te voglio.” Once on a time ('tis always so The charming fairy tales begin) People of all sorts pined, you know, Towers and dungeons in. For monarchs in that by-gone age— I beg you will remark— Consider'd 'twas a maxim sage, To keep folks in the dark. Once on a time—is long ago— And soon I hope they'll change their plan, And upon every subject throw As much light as they can. Indeed I'm told a Royal Pair With policy more sound, A palace built of crystal fair To let in light all round. Flor. Where is the Princess? Still asleep, I vow, Fast as a church! (approaching her) No, as a top just now; For turning round and round she seems to keep, The only way in which tops ever sleep. Desi. (in her sleep) Help! help! Flor. She's talking in her sleep, she's got The night-mare. Desi. (starting up and running to Floretta) Save me! Flor. Save you, ma'am, from what? Desi. Where am I? Flor. Don't you know, ma'am? look around, In your own tower, five stories under ground, Where you've been twenty years, all but a week. Desi. I tremble so, I scarce can stand or speak. Flor. You have been dreaming something very frightful. Desi. Yes—no—part of my dream was quite delightful. Flor. Oh, tell me all about it, madam, pray. Desi. Oppressed with slumber as I yonder lay, I dreamt— Flor. Well? Desi. That I dwelt— Flor. “In marble halls”? Desi. Exactly, but with windows in the walls, Through which I, for the first time since my birth, Saw the bright sun, blue sky and flower gemm'd earth. Entranced I gazed upon the lovely scene, When suddenly, a youth of noble mien, In rich attire knelt at my feet—oh, dear! How I did jump— Flor. For joy! Desi. No, no, for fear. My hand he seized, which both his own he prest in. Flor. Go on, the story's vastly interesting. Desi. And covered it with kisses—you will say, Perhaps I should have drawn my hand away; But he so took me by surprise I couldn't Move hand or foot. Flor. I couldn't! wouldn't! shouldn't! Well then, what then? Desi. Why then, in accents sweet, He said— Flor. What? Desi. What I ought not to repeat. Flor. Then of all things, that's what I long to learn. Desi. He loved me, and if I did not return His passion, die at once he'd only got to. Flor. Poor dear young man, of course you told him not to, Or words to that effect? Desi. I hardly know— For really ere I'd time to tell him so, A change came o'er the spirit of my dream, The sun's bright face did like a nigger's seem. My love was gone, and where he knelt I saw A monstrous crab, that held me with one claw; And raised the other to, what I suppose, The horrid creature might have called its nose; But more I know not, for with terror frantic, I shrieked and woke. Flor. How awfully romantic! One question in my mind becomes the upper, You're sure you didn't eat some crab for supper? Desi. Certain. Flor. Then there's no doubt of what it means— In one week you will be out of your teens, And of the Fairy Carabossa's power, To foil whose malice, you have in this tower Lived twenty years by candlelight—you know That dreams by their contraries always go! So yours reversing, I at once discover, The monster crab will give place to the lover, And on the day that ends her wicked charms, You will slip through her claws, into his arms. Desi. For this good fortune, so acutely told— Flor. You'll cross my hand with silver? Desi. No, with gold. Accept this ring, the gift in earlier days Of one of my eleven friendly fays; There is a certain virtue in't, but what, I am ashamed to say I've quite forgot. You'll find it out, no doubt, as you're so clever. Flor. At least, I'll keep it for your sake for ever. Air—Princess—“Thou art gone from my gaze.” He is gone from my gaze, whom I saw in my dream, But to see him quite plain still in fancy I seem; I can't breathe his dear name, if upon him I'd call, For I don't recollect to have heard it at all. At the moment I might—but I thought, I confess, More of his addresses than of his address; But there's one thing that's clear, that whoe'er he may be, If he's spirit he'll love and wed no one but me. Of this under-ground bower soon my leave I shall take, How I long for the hour, sweet youth, for thy sake! The deep plots and dark wiles, Love will foil, of the Crab, Who extends her vile claws, you and I, dear, to grab. Thou art gone from my gaze, but I will not complain, Ere long we shall meet, to part never again: Of no rival have fear, for whoe'er he may be, I've the spirit to love and wed no one but thee! Enter Page. Page. The Grand Duke and Grand Duchess. Enter Grand Duke and Grand Duchess. Desi. Father! Mother! Duch. Our only joy! Duke. For we have got no other. Duch. We've come ourselves to tell you the great news. Duke. Out of ten sovereigns, daughter, you may choose A crown. Desi. Ten! Duch. Ten ambassadors are here, Each with proposals for your hand, my dear. Duke. Your choice, you know, on one alone must fall— You are aware you cannot marry all. Desi. Perfectly, sir, nor am I bound to choose One of the ten, I hope. Duch. You'd not refuse Ten sovereigns in succession? Desi. Yes, indeed, If they're bad sovereigns, madam. Duch. Bad ones! Read, Grand Duke, the list of their illustrious names, Sent in with all their portraits. Duke. In such frames!— It is impossible to find ten finer! (producing list) First here's the Emperor of Chelsea China. Desi. A china husband! Flor. Off with him I'd break. Duke. The King of Chess! Desi. A king one cannot take. Duke. The Doge of Tennis! Flor. A sly doge, no doubt. Desi. And much too prone to racket, sir, about. Duke. The Dey of All-Jeers! Desi. Hey-day, that's all joke. Duke. The Sultan Meer-schaum! Flor. Meer-shams end in smoke. Duke. The Rajah Ram Jam Juggle Jib-a-hoy! Desi. The name's enough— Flor. I wish his lady joy! Duke. Ali Kampain, the Shah of— Desi. Pshaw! pooh! pooh! Duke. The Khan of Cream o' Tartar! Flor. Can not do. Duke. The Prince of Orange Marmalade! Desi. Too sweet. Duke. The Duke of Mangel Wurzel! Flor. Must be Beet. Desi. No more, I pray. Duke. There are no more, and so I grant your prayer. Desi. Then tell 'em all to go. Duch. Good gracious! they'll be dreadfully enraged. Desi. Say that I'm flattered, but that I'm engaged. Duke. Engaged! Duch. To whom? Desi. What can that signify? 'Tis a state secret—they'll know by-and-bye! In the meanwhile, a husband may be found. Duke. To think that girl's been brought up under ground! As much diplomacy the child displays, As if she'd been in office all her days! Duch. Where could she get her wit from? Duke. Not from me, I'm too much occupied with her to be. Duch. The gift of some good fairies, I'll be sworn, Who have protected her since she was born. Duke. It must be so, to use the words of Cato, When he agreed upon some point with Plato. Enter Staffhold. Staff. Another embassy is at the gate, The envoy in a most excited state, Craves an immediate audience in the name Of Felix, Prince of Happy Land, whose fame Has wafted been from Indus to the Pole. Desi. Felix! Staff. His life's in danger! Duke. Bless my soul! Staff. A dream of the Princess Desiderata Has moved him so he don't know what he's a'ter; His state the Court physician's skill defies, If the Princess refuses him, he dies! Desi. A dream! and dying too for love of me! (aside to each other) Flor. A strange coincidence there seems to be. (aside to each other) Desi. And Felix! I could almost vow I heard That name too in my dream! (aside to each other) Flor. Upon your word? (aside to each other) Duch. What answer can we make in this sad case? Duke. That we would not die were we in his place. Flor. Pray is the Prince's portrait here on view? Staff. As large as life, and quite as natural too. Duke. A speaking likeness, eh? Staff. You'll think me weak, sir, But sure as I'm alive I heard it speak, sir. Duke. What! with a voice? Staff. Sir, just as plain—in short, Plainer than you hear people speak at Court. Duke. What did it say? Staff. Why, as they turn'd the stair, It called out, “This side upwards, glass, with care.” The porters staggered, turned as pale as ashes, And nearly dropp'd and broke it all to smashes. Duke. At such a picture we must have a peep. Flor. (to Princess) If he's the young man you saw in your sleep, You'd know the face again? Desi. Amongst a million! Duke. (to Staffhold) Usher the envoy into the pavilion, And bring the picture hither, that we may Hear from its own lips what it has to say. (Exit Staffhold) Air—Ensemble—“Jetty Treffz Quadrille.” In Trafalgar Square How we all should stare, If the portraits there Spoke like that we've sent for. “The Royal Academy” had removed there from Somerset House. Flor. Many there are in the richest frames Should have the power to tell their names; For so completely they're in-cog, You can't believe the catalogue; Could they silence break, For politeness sake, We their words must take. As to who they're meant for. The picture is brought on and placed in the centre of the stage—The Attendants draw the curtains and discover the portrait of Prince Felix, full length and size of life. Desi. (starting, and aside to Floretta) 'Tis he, Floretta—like as it can be! Flor. A prettier fellow I ne'er wish to see. Duch. Towards our daughter it turns both its eyes. Duke. It opes its mouth! Portrait. (to Princess) Love Felix, or he dies! Duke. It spoke—I heard it speak with my own ears! Desi. The same sweet voice! Flor. Its eyes seem full of tears! Say something kind to it, for pity's sake; It sighs as if its very frame would break! Desi. (to Portrait) New life to Felix if her love can give, Desiderata bids her Felix live. Flor. Look, look, what rapture now in every feature! It understands you like a living creature. Portrait. (to Princess) Sweet Princess, Felix lives for you alone! Flor. Shew me a painting equals that for tone. Desi. There's not an artist in the whole profession Could shew one to surpass it in expression. Duke. I do remember a wax doll I saw, That mov'd its eyes, and said, “Pa-pa, Ma-ma.” Duch. But this chef d'œuvre hears as well as talks! Flor. It beats all heads in crayons, ma'am, by chalks. Duch. (to Princess) But do you really mean, child, what you've said? Duke. Aye, have you made your mind up on this head? Desi. Sir, in this portrait I the features trace Of him I love. Duke. She says it to his face! Desi. And whom I'll marry, if you've no objection. Duke. Marry, not I—we sanction your selection. Flor. (to Princess) If the Prince only with the painter vies, In Love's Heart Union you've drawn the great prize. Trio—Princess, Prince, and Floretta—Air, “Sally Snow.” Desi. My poor heart's in such a pother, I feel—I can't tell how— Portrait. I ne'er shall love another! Flor. Oh, of course he'll say so now! All. Then farewell—farewell, Farewell, till off we go: Pray take care of yourself, my dear, For the sake of self &amp; Co! Duch. Where is the envoy?—There's no time to lose; The Prince may die before he hears the news. Desi. Oh, see him then, dear sir, without delay. Duke. Beg the Ambassador to walk this way. (Exit Staffhold) Ensemble—Air—“March of all Nations.” The Sovereign grand Of Happy Land His royal hand Hath sent to proffer; 'Twouldn't do For me or you To say pooh-pooh To such an offer! Hark to the sound of trumpets and of drums! With us to treat a noble envoy comes; With every honour let him welcomed be. Who comes to treat we're always glad to see! The Sovereign grand, &amp;c. Enter Ambassador and Staffhold, followed by Guards. Duke. Your Excellency's welcome to our Court! Amb. Sir, the illustrious line of— Duke. Cut it short. Amb. Cut short the line of— Duke. No, but the address, And come to business in two words or less. Amb. In two words, then, the Prince— Duke. To cut it shorter, Has popped out of his picture for our daughter, And been accepted.—You've our leave to go Back to your master, and inform him so. Amb. Such prompt proceedings take my breath away! Duke. What matters if you've nothing more to say? Flor. (aside) If all who for dispatch of business meet Would do more and talk less, 'twould be a treat. Amb. Sir, I rejoice, for the affair cries speed, And you have made short work of it indeed. Unparallel'd in contracts of this sort! Duke. What is contracting, pray, but making short? Amb. It glads me, sir, to hear this definition, Because the other portion of my mission, Might otherwise precipitate appear. Duke. Out with it. Amb. Briefly, sir, by proxy here, Her Highness without loss of time to marry, And home to her impatient husband carry. Duke. By all means, this day week she shall depart. Amb. Alas! ere this day week, I fear his heart Would cease to beat, so desperate his state— A day, an hour, may seal my master's fate! For the Princess incessantly he raves, And neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor shaves. Duch. How touching! Duke. How unpleasant. Flor. And how lazy. Desi. A poor young man for me gone downright crazy! Amb. Not many days to live the doctor gave him. Flor. What can be done to shave—I mean to save him! Duke. I'm positively puzzled how to act:— You're not aware of an important fact; A spell upon my daughter has been cast, By an old crabbed fairy, which will last Till she is twenty. Seven more suns must rise E'er without danger one may meet her eyes; If e'er that day the light of day she see, That very instant there's an end of she! Amb. Permit me to inquire what sort of end? Duke. Oh, something horrible, you may depend. But as exactly what I never knew, You will perhaps excuse my telling you. Amb. Under such circumstances, sir, to press you, Would be indelicate—I'll not distress you; But with your leave, make one short observation. I had of this some previous intimation, And come prepared to meet the exigence; We have had made, regardless of expense, A snug close carriage, which has not a chink, Through which “the garish eye of day” could wink, And I engage thus, safely under cover, To post her Serene Highness to her lover. Air—Ambassador—“The Low Back'd Car.” When first I heard her Highness Shrunk from the light of day, I knew a glass coach wouldn't do, Nor yet a one horse shay. A very handsome cab I built, With doors and blinds so tight, Out of it she cannot be spilt, Nor in it take a sight. As she sits in that handsome cab She may laugh at that sour old crab For by day and by night 'Twill be “Go on, all right,” While she sits in that handsome cab! Duke. Astonishing! Duch. A most ingenious plan! Flor. (to Ambassador) Sir, you are not an ordinary man! Amb. Madam, I can but say, no more are you. Duke. The difficulty this quite pulls us through. Flor. Removes it and the Princess both together! Desi. My heart you've made as light, sir, as a feather! Duke. (to Princess) By proxy you shall instantly be married, And after sunset off in safety carried, To the grand terminus of all your pain Speed in his Excellency's special train. Amb. A telegraphic message I'll dispatch, To say you have consented to the match. Duke. Do so; perhaps a shock of electricity, May very much conduce to his felicity! Flor. At all events I'll hazard this remark. Would for me too it might produce a spark. Ensemble. Air—All—“Agnes Polka.” Marry me/her carry me/her off without delay, sir, Only mark, in the dark keep me/her all the way, sir; Verily, verily, shall I dance the day, sir, She may see the day begin. Amb. In the dark to keep her quite, Is a task by no means light; I must keep a look-out bright, That no spark look in. Marry her, &amp;c. (Exeunt Grand Duke and Duchess, Princess, followed by Floretta, Ambassador, Ladies, and Guards.) Scene Third. —A Glimpse of Happy Land, from the Palace of Sans-Souci. Enter Couleur de Rose and Prospero. Pros. The Prince recovered! C. de Rose. Quite as well as you, Or I. Pros. Ecstatic tidings, if they're true. C. de Rose. Of that there cannot be the slightest doubt, Here's the official bulletin just out; (reading) “Prince Felix woke after a good night's rest, Rang for hot water, rose, and shaved, and drest; And to his page with feeling said, ‘Your hand, boy, I am all right and jolly as a sand boy.’ No further bulletin will issued be,— Signed, Esculapius Homeopath, M. D.” Pros. What can have worked so wonderful a cure? C. de Rose. Not the physician, that you may be sure. A message came last night by telegraph, Which made him better, by a better half; And thus the only and uncommon sadness In Happy Land is changed to common gladness. Pros. Common, indeed. We're all, 'tis but too true, So happy that we don't know what to do! Some crisis must be near. (trumpet without) C. de Rose. The Prince behold, Looking once more fresh as a four-year-old. Enter Prince Felix, followed by four Pages. Pros. Long live Prince Felix! C. de Rose. Best of princes living! Prince. Friends, give me joy. C. de Rose. 'Tis hardly worth the giving; Every one has it, sir, in your dominions, Where all your subjects hold the same opinions; A land of corn and wine, oil, milk and honey, Where all is done for love and naught for money. We hardly know whether your restoration, Is to yourself cause of congratulation; For surfeited with bliss, the taste of grief We fancied must be almost a relief. Prince. You're right; at first I quite enjoyed each throe, And revelled in the luxury of woe! But after all, I can't say it's unpleasant, To feel as jolly as I do at present; With the sweet prospect of a lovely wife To share my careless throne and cloudless life, Amidst a happy people who adore me, And ministers who never cross or bore me. C. de Rose. Sir, we regret to draw your grave attention To the effect of what you're pleased to mention. The people are with joy almost delirious, Their gaiety is really getting serious; And it becomes our duty to point out The evil lurking so much good about. The Treasury is over stock'd with treasure, The Bank is crammed with bullion beyond measure; Funds have gone up so desperately high, None can sell out, because none in can buy! Shares of all sorts are paying Cents per cent., There's scarce a landlord will receive his rent; Our tradesmen smiling give their goods away, And think no sacrifice too great to-day. Our manufacturers are in such feather! They talk of leaving business altogether! Fortunes are made too rapidly by farming! We are so prosperous, it's quite alarming! Pros. And while at home, our bliss is so abounding, Foreign affairs are equally astounding! Throughout the Fairy World, from ev'ry power, Friendly assurances arrive each hour. Our navy but for pleasure rides the seas, Our standing army only stands at ease! And I can't help the same opinion nourishing, We shall be ruined if we keep so flourishing! Prince. I feel the truth of what you've represented, If folks can't grumble, they'll get discontented; Can any patriot devise some measure To check this perfect plethora of pleasure? C. de Rose. One talked of calling, sir, a public meeting, And earnestly the Government entreating, To put some sort of burthen on their backs, If it were nothing but—an Income Tax. And as beneath no debt our own state labours, We might propose to pay off all our neighbour's. Prince. Not a bad scheme, for at the richest lockers, Tax gatherers are not too welcome knockers; And if the nation must be sobered down, Such means might do it moderately brown; I'll turn the matter over in my mind, But at this moment am too much inclined Myself to drain the cup of rapture dry, To cause my meanest subject one sad sigh. To horse, my friends!—'tis meet on such a day, That I should meet my better half, half-way! (Exeunt Couleur de Rose and Prospero) Air—Prince—“Happy Land.” Happy Land! Happy Land! Your Prince's bride that is to be, With her train soon will gain The gates of Sans-Souci; Rend with shouts the sunny skies, Hail the royal beauty; With merry hearts and laughing eyes, Come pay to her your duty! Happy Land! Happy Land! Nothing else you have to pay, Burthens none—save the one To your merry monarch's lay!—Lira la! &amp;c. What other land as much can say? Happy Land! Happy Land! A model state you sure must be, Rogues in grain—poor in pain— Are sights you never see. 'Gainst the throne no rebels plot, Why should folks upset it? Everything on earth they've got, Without wishing they may get it! Happy Land! Happy Land! What to you is quarter day? Merry Christmas you can keep!— You've no Christmas bills to pay!—Lira la, &amp;c. What other land as much can say? (Exit Prince, followed by Pages) Scene Fourth. —Black Gang Chine. Enter Nigretta and Black Slaves. Nig. Within a mile of Happy Land's gay borders, I come by mighty Carabossa's orders, To cross my hated rival's path to bliss, And make that mile to her good as a miss! I may not with this knife cut her to bits, But in the carriage curtains make some slits, Through which the light of day may on her shine, What then will happen is Fate's work, not mine. But this at least I know—there is no doubt of her Having the shine completely taken out of her! Approach, you slaves! (Blacks advance) Now mind what you've to do. The caravan will soon appear in view; Salute the envoy as you've heard me mention, And by your melody attract the attention Of all the suite—whilst I prepare the bitter, By letting light into the lady's litter; Rattle your bones, and on your banjos thrum Bravely!— (march heard without faintly) A drum! a drum! the bride doth come! March louder—Nigretta and Blacks retire as the caravan enters, with the Ambassador, Floretta, and the Princess—The latter in a covered litter, closely curtained. Amb. Command they make a halt upon this spot. Officers, Halt! halt! halt! Amb. Halt! zounds! will you halt or not? Flor. How far is't called to Happy Land? Amb. If clear, Its rosy mountains you might see from here. (Black Slaves advance with their instruments) Flor. Mercy upon me!—what on earth are these In toggery like those black bands one sees In town, called Ethiopian Serenaders? And yet, perhaps, they're only masqueraders! Sing you?—or are you taught to play the bones And banjos?—Are you blacks from Torrid Zones? Or only lamp black'd blacks? you should be niggers, And yet I've known fools make themselves such figures, That were not so— Amb. Speak if you can, you ninny! Black. Ees, massa, we come here from Old Virginny. We sing you lilly song, or play you tune— Dan Tucker, Lucy Neal, or Old Zib Coon! Flor. (to Ambassador) Whilst here we rest and take a little snack, Suppose we hear these gentlemen in black. It may amuse her Highness. (going to carriage) Madam! Desi. (in the carriage) Well? Flor. Are you asleep? Desi. It's so dark I can't tell. Flor. Are you disposed to listen to a song? Desi. Yes, if it's very good and not too long. Nigger Melody. During which Floretta the Ambassador, and all the Attendants and Escort gather round the singers. (Nigretta advances to carriage) Nig. Now is the time! (cuts with her knife a large piece out of the side of the curtain, and the Princess Desiderata is seen seated within) Desi. What do I see—the sun! Flor. Oh criminy, we're ruined and undone! Music—Storm—The Fairy Carabossa appears. Nig. Victory! Cara. Vengeance! Change thy form—begone! (to Princess) And live for ever hunted as a Fawn! Music—The Princess vanishes, and a White Fawn bounds out of the carriage, and disappears amongst the rocks— Carabossa departs with Nigretta—Storm increases to a hurricane—Ambassador and Escort are swept off by the tempest—Floretta sinks swooning with terror on a bank— On a sudden the storm subsides, the music changes its character, the rocks open in all directions, and discover glittering Arcades and Alleys, planted with fruit trees and flowering shrubs of the most beautiful description, down which advance troops of Fairies, and lastly the Fairy Pine-Apple. Pine. Fond, foolish parents, who my warning slighted The ill I feared has on your daughter lighted! Her faithful servant, though she couldn't save her, Has been protected by the ring I gave her. Bear her, ye Fairies, to the forest shade, Where the White Fawn her leafy home hath made; There must they both in sad seclusion dwell, Till Fate, relenting, shall dissolve the spell! Music—The bank on which Floretta has fallen changes to a couch of flowers, on which she is borne off by the Fairies. Song—Fairy Pine-Apple—Air, “Come with me to Fairy Land.” Every land is Fairy-land, Where I dance—where I sing— Mistress of the Magic Wand, Servant of the Ring! Dark mountains cleaving Ope for me their golden bowers, Deserts up-heaving, Team with sunny fruits and flowers. Every land is Fairy-land, &amp;c. Old-fashioned fairies the world that would keep Crab-like crawling in foul and murky night, We're the spirits away to sweep; Champions of purity, progress, and light! Every land is Fairy-land!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene First. —A Wilderness in Hi-ho-che-vee. Enter Tan-ti-vee and Native Hunters. Air—Tan-ti-vee—“The Crystal Hunters.” In search of sport—of any sort, The Indian Hunter bounds along, And to his blind “untutored mind” It don't appear he's doing wrong, But wiser he will be some day, When for his license made to pay! In search of sport, &amp;c. Enter Prince Felix. Prince. Friends, sportsmen, countrymen, and very rum'uns, Lend me your ears! Tan. A most facetious summons. Perhaps the gentleman will next propose To borrow some good-natured person's nose. Prince. I ask you not to crop a single pair, I know you've literally none to spare; Your ears but figuratively I'd borrow, To pour into them a poor prince's sorrow. Tan. Were you a rich prince, we'd, to hear you, stay; But as you are a poor one, sir, good-day. (going) Prince. Not poor in purse, witness the one I fling Amongst you! (flings them a heavy purse) Tan. Oh, that's quite another thing! We didn't understand you, sir, before. Prince. I feel indeed I'm on a foreign shore; Your language and your manners are most strange, The very sight of gold seems both to change. Tan. Anything strange in that can you discover? I fancied it was so all the world over. Prince. Not where I come from. Gold we value at Less price than merit. Tan. Where on earth is that? Prince. In Happy Land, where love's the only care. Tan. (to his companions) Poor fellow, he's as mad as a March hare. I thought so, when he gave us so much money; I like to hear him talk though, it's quite funny. (to Prince) What lured you from that Happy Land away? Prince. Love! which has led so many men astray. To meet my bride I rode in royal state, But scarce a mile from out the city gate, A whirlwind rose, which swept away my train, And carried me o'er mountain, and o'er plain, Into this wilderness. About its ways I've wander'd, as I may say, in a maze. No food but nuts, if food you that can call, Which really I'm not nuts upon at all. Tan. Well, as it seems you can afford to pay— What can we do to serve your Highness, pray? Prince. Say where I am, and which the nearest road, By which I can regain my own abode? Tan. Why, here you are, but which the road to where You say you dwell, that's neither here nor there. Prince. Alas! your information's very small, It actually amounts to none at all: This land must have a name? Tan. Oh yes, this place Is called amongst us, Hi-ho-che-vee Chase; The famous hunting grounds, as you must know, Of the great sporting tribe of Tal-lee-ho. Prince. (aside) Methinks I've somewhere heard of “High-ho-Chivy.” What is your name, pray? Tan. My name is Tan-ti-vee, A native chief, and to the manor born, I trace my line from Nimrod, through French Horn! Prince. (aside) A line through a French horn cannot be straight. Tan. But we shall lose the game, if here we wait. All sorts of folks come on our manor poaching, There's a Grand Duke has just begun encroaching; And by-and-bye, no doubt, these new deer-stalkers Will designate our tribe unlicensed hawkers, And ride rough shod over the poor old nation, In the true spirit of colonisation. Prince. A Grand Duke! should it be my pa-in-law! Tan. Can't say—because the chap we never saw. (going) Prince. But will you leave me of the fact in doubt? Tan. Well, take this bow and try and hunt him out. (Exeunt Tan-ti-vee and Hunters) Prince. I fear this bow will be of little use, 'Twill scarcely serve to say bo! to a goose. Air—Prince—“Dearest May.” How horribly provoking to be taken up by Fate, Transported without trial to this disunited state! I've heard that when you take a wife for squalls you must look out; But such a squall as blew me here, I couldn't dream about. Although she may have had the deuce to pay 'Twas not polite of Fortune quite To raise the wind this way! I took a bridle path on what I thought my bridal day, And meant to make a honey-moon of all the moon of May; But sadly have I lost my time, for by some fairy freak I'm certain I've been blown into the middle of next week! My train—despair! I can't find anywhere! I sooner might in Bradshaw light On a train I wanted there! (Exit) (music—The couch of flowers, with Floretta on it, glides on guided by Fairies) Flor. (waking and rubbing her eyes) Bless me! I've overslept myself! oh! murder! My lady's rung her bell, and I've not heard her! What's this? and where? daylight! and out of doors; Ah! I remember, those vile blackamoors, And blacker mistress, with her base black art, Who turned, like a poor deer, out of a cart, My dear young Princess, to become the prey Of the first wicked dog that runs that way! Oh, wretched fate! (clasping her hands) (music—The Fairy Pine-Apple appears) Ugh! lud! who's this I see? Pine. You needn't be alarmed, it's only me. Flor. Who's me, for goodness sake? Pine. You ought to know, Since you invoked my presence! Flor. I, how so? Pine. By rubbing of that ring upon your finger! Where'er I am, I ne'er a second linger, But to the wearer fly with lightning speed. Flor. I didn't mean to do it, ma'am, indeed! Pine. (smiling) I know, you never dream'd of such a thing, In wringing of your hands you rubbed the ring, And I obeyed the summons. Now we've met, What can I do to serve you? Flor. Let me get My breath first, for you've taken that away. Pine. You'd like to see your mistress, I dare say. Flor. Oh! yes, indeed, ma'am, if you'd be so good, Of all things in the universe, I should! Music—Some fern and underwood open and discover the White Fawn couched in it. Ah! the dear creature! Might I nearer peep Without disturbing it? Pine. Yes! Flor. Could I creep Just close enough to kiss it, madam? Pine. Go! Flor. But won't it rise and run away then? Pine. No! Floretta approaches the Fawn cautiously, stoops and kisses it—The Fawn lifts its head, and seems to return the salute. Flor. O joy! it knows me! See, it licks my face! And big round pearly drops each other chase A' down its innocent nose! How can one cheer Its heavy heart? Don't cry so, there's a deer! I'll stay beside, and pet, and wash, and curry it, And nasty dogs shall never come and worry it. Pine. I have the power this poor Princess's fate In some degree, perhaps, to mitigate. At set of sun her shape regain she may, But be a fawn again at break of day; If this small boon would gratify you, say so. Flor. And may she change back every night? Pine. She may so. Flor. Oh, then, with rapture we accept the boon! Pine. 'Tis well. The sun is setting now. As soon As its last rays shall fade from sea and land, Desiderata shall before you stand. (music) Flor. 'Tis going! going! gone! At the moment the sun is supposed to set, the stage darkens, and the Fawn changes to the Princess Desiderata. Oh, joy transcendant! My darling mistress! Desi. My attached attendant! Help me to thank my fairy benefactress! Pine. Nay, in this scene Floretta's the chief actress, Twice has the ring she wears displayed its might— But you will want some lodgings for the night; So on the spot I'll build a model cottage, In which to make your beds and cook your pottage. Music—Cottage appears. Farewell, and of your time the best use make— With day, a fawn again you must awake. Trio—Princess, Floretta, and Fairy Pine-Apple. Air—“A Life by the Galley Fire.” A life in a deer's attire, Where the coppice is thick and wild, Is not what you'd/I'd quite desire, Nor at all what suits this child. But your/my doom to mitigate And assuage your/my servant's woe, Each night you'll/we'll be tête-à-tête, Though by day you/I must doze a doe. (At the end of the trio exit Fairy Pine-Apple) Flor. My feelings to describe I strive in vain, I never thought to hear you speak again! Desi. And I can't tell you even with the tongue Which I've recovered, how my heart was wrung To find myself made such a beast by some one, And for a lady—worse than all, a dumb one! Flor. Oh, 'twas as wicked, madam, as improper, To put upon that lovely jaw a stopper; On four legs it was bad enough to walk, But not to be allowed even to talk! The cruel stars what had you done to vex That they had no compassion for your sex. Desi. And then the danger! as a deer, incog., Without a word left to throw at a dog! Flor. So shocking, too, to wander in your mere skin About the woods, although it was a deer-skin; And feel that in the form that you possessed, You must be killed before you could be dressed. Desi. Would I were dead, and made into a pasty! Flor. Nay, sweetest mistress, that wish is too hasty. Let's in and rest; you'll find a bed of feather Much more agreeable than a bed of heather. If as a stricken deer you weep all day, At night let your poor heart ungallèd play. Duet—Princess and Floretta—Air, “All around the Maypole”—“Midas.” All around the green wood here to trot, Sad lot!—Ev'ry day you've/I've got! Dawning morning gives you/me warning, Then/Go rest you'd/I'd best in this cot, Till around the green wood here to trot, Sad lot!—you're/I'm off like a shot! (Exeunt into the cottage) Scene Second. —Interior of a Hunting Lodge, or Gamekeeper's Hut. Enter Grand Duke, followed by Page. Duke. “To chase the deer with hound and horn,” one day, The ballad says, “Earl Percy took his way.” And so far am I like that great Earl Percy. But in the sequel it's quite vice-versy; He died for glory, as that whim they call, Now I for glory never died at all! Still some resemblance e'en in that may be Found in one sense between Lord P. and me. 'Twas the last thing he did, and 'tis most true, 'Tis the last thing that I intend to do! To the black game of war I ne'er was partial; My court is anything but a court-martial. When I go shooting I do not desire That anybody should return my fire; I like a long shot at a stag of ten— A buck that cannot shoot at me again! And I've come here to get one—what's o'clock? Enter Staffhold. Who's there? Staff. 'Tis I! the early village cock Hath thrice done salutation to the morn! Duke. Then blow those rogues! why don't they blow the horn, And let us start? Staff. You'll start, sir, fast enough, When you have heard the tidings. Duke. Don't talk stuff To frighten me—you look as pale, for certain, As he who drew one night King Priam's curtain, And would have shouted “Fire!” but for choking, While Priam's nightcap was already smoking. Staff. Your loss, I fear, is great as that of Priam. Duke. It can't be—he was not insured, and I am! Staff. Your goods may be insured from fire or water, But did your policy include your daughter? Duke. Daughter—you didn't say my daughter—don't! Staff. You haven't got one now, sir, so I won't. Duke. 'Tis false! we lose a son who takes a wife— Our daughter is our daughter all her life. Staff. The whiles in Black Gang Chine a halt they made, A band of darkies sang a serenade; To the wild air they sang an air succeeded, Which was much wilder than the Princess needed; It tore her carriage all to little bits, Frightened the Guard of Honour into fits! And when their scattered senses they collected, No trace could of her Highness be detected. Duke. The spell, the fatal spell! 'tis clear as day, She's fallen a victim to that shell-fish fay! She saw the light, and ah! “Light come, light go.” Staff. Some swear they saw a beautiful white doe Into a thicket from the carriage bound. Duke. Desiderata, for a thousand pound; And I, and I, oh miserable sire, Who was so eager at some deer to fire, In luckless hour I might have shot my daughter, And been for life transported for manslaughter! Or lived to see the last of all my race, Carefully stuff'd and stuck in a glass case. But still she is in peril just as great, Some desperate poacher on his own estate— Some lawless Aboriginal intruder, May through these woods already have pursued her! And you stand gaping there, you rascal, run, Muzzle each dog, and seize on every gun; On pain of death, let any hunter dare To fire, even at nothing, in the air. (Exit Officer) And you (to Page) for pen and ink this instant fly, Page draws on table with writing materials) (writes hastily) Get this inserted in the “Hue and Cry,“ “Lost, stolen, or strayed on the high road to marriage, A handsome young Princess, out of her carriage; Had on when she was last seen a plain white Jacket of doe skin, fitting very tight; Vest and continuations of the same, Goes on four legs, each of them being game. Whoever finds and brings the pretty deer Alive and kicking to her parents here, Shall be rewarded”—not with dirty pelf— We permit virtue to reward itself! (Exit Page) Duo—Grand Duke and Staffhold. Air—“Dandy Jim.” Staff. Those Bandy Blacks from Caroline, They played upon the bones so fine; Whoever thought in Black Gang Chine They'd kick up such a precious shine? Why did you let her Highness go? She'd the handsomest figure in the country O! If she look'd in the glass, now she wouldn't know Herself, unless somebody told her so! Duke. If on those Blacks my hands I lay, With broken bones I'll make 'em play, And accompany with a cat o' nine The tales they bring from Caroline. My daughter's chang'd into a doe, By that wicked old “Lady in the Lobster” O! If she look'd in the glass, now she wouldn't know Herself, unless somebody told her so! (Exeunt Duke and Staffhold) Scene Third. —The Forest. Enter Floretta. Flor. Was ever a poor female so afflicted? At daybreak, as the Fairy had predicted, Her Serene Highness bounded out of bed, Once more a poor unhappy quadruped! Skipped upon four legs all the room about— Scratched at the door with one, to be let out— And when I wouldn't, lifted up the latch With her own nose, and jump'd clean o'er the hatch! This way she ran—but it's no use my following— I'm downright hoarse with whooping and with holloing. Air—Floretta—“The Gipsy Tent.” Beating about the bush, Wildly I go— Through the brush wood I brush After my doe! Some cruel bow may have Aimed at her breast. Some Richard Roe may have Caused her arrest! Beating about the bush, &amp;c. Down run like rain dear, My tears from each eye, Hunting in vain dear, I go in full cry! Beating about the bush, &amp;c (looking off) Footsteps!—a young man running through the wood. What game's he after?—I'll be sworn no good. I vow the horrid monster's got a bow! Enter Prince Felix, with bow and arrow. Prince. Have you seen a white deer, ma'am? Flor. Dear sir, no! Prince. Did not one pass this way? a doe—a hind— A fawn—a— Flor. No, sir, nothing of the kind. (aside) He has been hunting her!—I must invent Some story, which may put him off the scent. Prince. Provoking! 'twas the prettiest little thing! I found it drinking at yon crystal spring; At sight of me it started—stood at gaze An instant—then in many pretty ways Expressed—it really seemed—joy at our meeting But still as I advanced, it kept retreating, Until perceiving me about to fling Around its neck this little silken string, It cleared the bushes at a bound, and flew Like lightning from me! Flor. Very proper too. Prince. Proper! I took my bow— Flor. You didn't shoot? Prince. I didn't mean, of course, to kill the brute. Flor. The brute! Prince. If not a brute, what should it be? Flor. If you have killed her, you're the brute, not she. Prince. Civil, I vow—but moderate your ire, And hear my story out—I didn't fire; She was too quick for me, and in the brake Had vanished ere a sure aim I could take. Flor. A sure aim! Why, then, there! you own you would Have killed the poor dear creature, if you could. Prince. You silly woman, I have told you no. I am a crack shot both with gun and bow; And if I get a chance again, you'll see I'll pin it, through one ear, against a tree, And so catch it alive. Flor. Let me catch you At such a trick; you'll catch it if I do. Duo—Prince and Floretta. Air—“In son ricco.” Prince. I shall not stand upon trifles, To secure that fawn so white, I am a captain in the Rifles, And a crack Toxopholite! Flor. You may crack about your shooting, But if any such young rake Come for venison here freebooting, A fine hash of it he'll make. Prince. Pistols too, as well I handle, If you've someone to shew fight, I can snuff out a wax candle, At twelve paces any night. Flor. In that horrid way don't chatter, If that fawn you better knew, Instead of popping at her, You would be for popping to. Prince. Hush! Flor. I won't hush! Prince. For your life, not a word, A rustling in that bush I'm sure I heard. Music—The head of the Fawn appears for an instant above the bush, the next minute it is seen to leap through a gap, and is lost amidst the trees. Prince. Yes! there it is—and there! yoicks! gone away! (aims and shoots) Flor. Murder! he's going to shoot. Oh, don't sir, pray! Prince. Hit her, or my name isn't Felix! Flor. What! Felix, Prince Felix? Prince. Yes! Flor. Then if you've shot That fawn, and nailed it bleeding to a tree, You've done for Mrs. F. that was to be. (runs out) Prince. I've done for Mrs. F! The woman's mad! And who is Mrs. F. suppose I had? Pooh, bother Mrs. F! Whilst here I'm guessing That crazy wench my venison will be dressing! (music—Exit Prince, after Floretta, hastily) Scene Fourth. —A deeper part of the Wood. Enter Prince Felix, meeting the Ambassador. Amb. Prince Felix! Prince. Ha! that voice! that face! Count Klever! Amb. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever. Prince. What wind has blown you into this strange wood? Amb. Alas! an ill wind, sir, that blows no good. Prince. I would not hear your enemy say so, For better friend than you it could not blow. Amb. It took me up and whirl'd me heav'n knows whither! Prince. Just such a wind it was that blew me hither, And having lost entirely my track, I'm through this forest hunting my way back. But where's my bride? by the same favouring gale, Did she come too? Amb. What tongue shall tell her tale? Prince. Dead! Amb. Worse! Prince. False! Amb. Worser! if the dreadful rumour Be true, her Highness has become— Prince. A Bloomer! Amb. No, but as much unlike to womankind, Whate'er she was afore, she's now a hind! Prince. A hind!—a female of the genus Cervus! Amb. White as the driven snow! Prince. Your words unnerve us! F. stands for Felix! then it was no fib! I've sent an arrow clean through my own rib! Amb. Shot the Princess! Prince. Too sure I am I hit her! Amb. Ah, see, they bring her wounded on a litter. Music—Hunters enter, bearing the White Fawn on a litter, made of branches of trees; an arrow is through its ear and fore foot. Prince. (rushing to the Fawn) Oh! pardon me, thou bleeding lump of doe! That you were some one else, how could I know? Enter Floretta. Flor. Yes, you're a nice young man, see what you've done! You a crack shot, why you're not half an one. You said you'd pin her ear but to a tree, You've pinned it to her foot, you monster, see! Prince. That was no fault of mine, indeed! 'tis clear She must have raised her foot to scratch her ear. Amb. I cannot draw the arrow from the wound! Flor. With loss of blood already she has swoon'd! Amb. Have you some salts? Flor. No, but in such a quarter There can't be lack of hartshorn or of water! Prince. She's better! see, she opes her fawn-like eyes! I trust 'tis not a case of “Doe demise!” Flor. Oh, yes! I never nursed a young gazelle, But just as it began to know me well, And love me, it was sure to— Amb. Pray no more— We really have heard that so oft before. Flor. The envoy! no one else would have the face. My grief was blind—I did not see your grace; What can you now say to excuse your master? This wound cannot be healed by your Court plaster. Music—Enter Grand Duke and Suite. Duke. Where is the fellow who has shot a deer, Despite our proclamation? Flor. Sir, he's here! Duke. Have you a license taken out, or no? Prince. I have no license. Duke. Seize him!—take his bow! I'll teach his young idea how to shoot In my preserves! Prince. Your power I do dispute! I am a Sovereign Prince as well as you— Felix of Happy Land! Duke. Can this be true? Flor. As true, sir, as that here your daughter lies, By this fool's bolt soon shot! Prince. In that disguise, How could I guess— Duke. My daughter!—this—distraction! Oh! I'll have sanguinary satisfaction! Prince, or no Prince! Prince. But where's the proof 'tis she? Flor. The sun is setting and you'll shortly see! Amb. If we see shortly, we shall be short sighted! Prince. The sun has set, and we're the more benighted. Music—The stage grows dark, the Fawn disappears, and Desiderata is seen seated on the litter, with an arrow through her wrist and ear. Flor. There, there she is! and see, oh, sight of fear! The fatal arrow through her wrist and ear! Duke. Desiderata! Desi. Father! I've heard all! On Felix wherefore should your vengeance fall? Ladies have had their ears pierced oft before— His well-aimed arrow would have done no more, But, by ill-luck, just at the very minute, I raised my hand— Flor. (pathetically) And so put your foot in it! Desi. Forgive him, sir, as I do! Prince. Generous fair, I never shall forgive myself, I swear! Duke. And will you still consent to be his wife? Desi. Sir, has he not secured my hand for life? Duke. Secured it! skewered it, I should say. Prince. Sweetheart, A skilful surgeon will extract the dart. Flor. You must make haste, then, for, I grieve to say, She'll be a fawn again, at break of day; And though to-night she wants but two feet merely, On three to-morrow she'll go very queerly. Duke. What, change again? Desi. Alas, 'tis but too true. Enter Carabossa and Nigretta. Therefore, sweet Prince, I am no wife for you, One so much given to change must never marry. (music—Carabossa and Nigretta come forward) Cara. Certainly not! Duke. The Crab, and with old Harry! Cara. Here is a bride will suit Prince Felix better. She'll never change! Flor. (aside) Colour I grant. Prince. Nigretta! Nig. Yes, faithless Prince, whose hand you sued for. Prince. Never, As I'm a gentleman! Bear witness, Klever, Was't not my father's act, unknown to me? Amb. It was, and to object he left you free. Duke. And you objected? Prince. Certainly. Nig. And still Object? Prince. Decidedly, and ever will. Amb. (to Floretta) Though he can't wash her white, he might soft soap her. Flor. (to Ambassador) He's sadly wounded her black-amoor propre Cara. Beware! her rival's fate is in my hands, Consent, or I destroy her where she stands! Prince. Mercy! spare her and take my wretched life! Cara. Felix! accept Nigretta for your wife, And I Desiderata's friend will be. Prince. You will, then— Desi. Hold! no sacrifice for me, Whatever fears may shake my woman's frame, I've been a deer, and trust me, I'll die game! Duke. Heroic girl! she cannot be my daughter! Prince. We'll die together, then! Amb. Is there no quarter From whence some power may to their rescue spring? Flor. Ha! how could I forget! The ring! the ring! (music—Rubs the ring on her finger rapidly) Enter Fairy Pine-Apple and advances between the lovers and Carabossa. Fairy Pine-Apple waves her wand, and the scene changes to Scene Fifth. —The Golden Pinery. Pine. In Oberon's high Court I've been to day, Arrest of judgment in this cause to pray. He has most carefully looked through the pleadings And I his order bring to stay proceedings. Against this pair you have no ground for action, Excessive damages in satisfaction, You have already in one case obtained, And your black client's plea can't be sustained Of breach of promise—e'en if undisputed, For this young Prince she clearly is non-suited. Cara. I say of justice this is a denial! Pine. Then move this higher Court for a new trial. Flor. By all means. I'm a party to this suit— Pray grant a rule and make it absolute; And during Christmas Term each night you sit, Let's have a well-packed jury in the pit; Meanwhile, of course, we'll take, if you'll allow, A special verdict in our favour now. Finale. Air—“The Gipsy Tent.” Desi. Your Christmas game-laws Were never severe— Hold me not cheap, Because I've been a deer. Felix. Timid as any fawn, In any shape, From shafts by censure drawn, Let her escape. Flor. Though shallows and flats may have Perill'd our bark, Let her, for show, pray have Letters of mark! Don't let her stranded be, Here in the Strand— Happily landed see Our “Happy Land!” (music) Tableau. CURTAIN.</field>
