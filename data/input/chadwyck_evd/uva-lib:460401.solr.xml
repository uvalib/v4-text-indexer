      <field name="fulltext">TO Sir James Cockburn, Baronet, AS A LITTLE TRIBUTE OF FRIENDSHIP AND GRATITUDE, THIS TRAGEDY IS INSCRIBED, BY HIS MUCH OBLIGED, AND MOST AFFECTIONATE BROTHER-IN-LAW, AND VERY HUMBLE SERVANT. George Edward Ayscough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by G. E. AYSCOUGH, Esq. Spoken by Mr. REDDISH. Critics! I come your favour to implore For one, who never quak'd so much before! He, for a while, has left the gay parade, Has doff'd the gorget!âand the smart cockade! Each instrument of war has thrown aside, To fret! and strut it hereâin tragic pride! From foreign shores are rich materials brought, Which to your English mode our Bard has wrought. PhÅbus forefendâlest he new dangers run, And rise, like Icarus, too near the sun; On waxon pinions just about to sink, On his own rashness then too late he'll think, And drown in a black sea ofâcritic's ink! Ye gentle, feeling, female hearts be kind! A soldier sues!âhis brows with laurels bind! In thisâyour empire, your protection yield! At life's expenceâhe'll pay you in the field! Nor fighting battles, nor besieging towns, He dreads!âand only trembles at your frowns! But hold!âour Author bad me say one word To all his honour'd brothers of the sword! He begs by them this night to be befriended; And bids me promise, (this great bus'ness ended) He'll gladly re-assume the Sash once more, If they his pristine rank will then restore, Nor deem him a deserter from the CORPS!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. In Front the Palace of Semiramis appears, with the Gardens raised above it on lofty Terraces; on the Right Hand is seen the Temple of the Magi, and on the Left a vast Mausoleum adorned with Obelisks. Enter Arzaces and Mithranes. ARZACES. Yes, my Mithranes, by express command, In secret issued from the throne itself, Behold your friend in Babylon's proud walls! âYe powers, how all these wonders that surround us Strike my astonish'd senses, and imprint A faint idea of her noble soul Who plann'd these brilliant scenes, these massy tow'rs! See where yon temple rears its sacred head! See yon fair gardens in the air suspended! View next, with reverence, this monstrous pile By fond affection rear'd to her lov'd lord, This dark abode of Ninus!âO Mithranes! These are immortal works, inferior only To her who rais'd them! divine Semiramis! MITHRANES. Raise not thus high your hopes, warlike Arzaces, Least when you view this phÅnix of her sex, Grief should usurp the place of promis'd joy. ARZACES. How's this? MITHRANES. The Queen, alas! a prey to sorrow, Here vents those griefs that rend her tortur'd breast; One while she fills the air with direful shrieks, One while she musing, sad, and silent, sits, And looks like her whose senses are o'erthrown By moping melancholy;âthen again She starts! and bends her steps towards these shades, Sacred to night, to silence, and to death, And kneeling near the ashes of her lord, She beats her breast, tears her dishevel'd hair, And calls on Ninus, and her long-lost son. ARZACES. Since when has angry Heaven thus o'erwhelm'd her? MITHRANES. Alas 'twas then, even in that hour of joy, When Babylon with grateful shouts proclaim'd Your high deserts, When they enraptured gazed on fair Azema, Her whom your valour had but newly freed From Scythian ravishers, and barb'rous bonds; Then, when within this ancient city's walls No sounds were heard but those of varied mirth, Of revelry and joyâthen did the Queen, Like some fair flower, wither in her prime, And droop without one chilling, wintry blast. ARZACES. Thou mov'st my wonderâbut perchance Azema Shall work a cure; one pray'r of her's to Heaven, Shall calm the rage of the offended gods. Yet say, my friend, is the Queen ever thus? MITHRANES. Not always; for oft-times her tow'ring spirit Breaks from the galling shackles of affliction; But when again she sinks beneath the load Of these oppressive illsâher royal hands Let loose the reins of empire;âand Assures, That haughty prince, that shame of Belus' race, Wielding the scepter of the woe-worn Queen, Makes ev'n the nobles groan beneath his yoke, While all the empire feels his iron rule. ARZACES. By various dangers see me now environ'd! The traps, the wiles, the poison'd snares of courts. And who shall now direct my erring steps? Who wisely curb or check th'impetuous rage Of youthful passion?âOnce I had a guide, A friend, a counsellor, a tender parent, But oh they're lost for ever; ravish'd from me, And now lie buried in thy tomb, Phradates. MITHRANES. I cannot blame thy griefâyou've cause to mourn The pious sage Phradates,âNinus lov'd him, Alas my royal sovereign dearly lov'd him, And to his care and breeding did intrust His and this kingdom's hopeâthe youthful prince. Thou know'st it was thy sire's unhappy lot To have surviv'd them both, from which sad hour He bad farewell to courts, and freely sought An honourable exileâThou alone Of all mankind, didst reap a blessing from it; For thou didst catch instruction from his lips; He taught thee how to tread the paths of virtue, The way to greatness, and the road to heaven. ARZACES. I read not yet my fate within these walls: 'Tis true my sword has triumph'd in the war, And when Semiramis impos'd her laws O'er conquer'd nations, on the Oxine shores, From her victorious car a look she cast, A look of favour on my growing fame. But 'tis not so in courts; transplanted there The soldier languishes, is there thrown by, While slaves and silken cowards rule above him. All this my dying sire has oft declared, And has moreo'er in mystic language told me My fate depended on the common cause. That charge he then deliver'd to my care, [Pointing to a casket. Which long he kept conceal'd from eyes profane, He bad me trust it to the hallow'd hands Of Oroes the pontiff, who alone Its value knew, and could unfold its worth. MITHRANES. Deep is the holy science of this priest, By him the mysteries of Fate and Nature Are fathom'd and explored;âbut in his function, As in his holy vestments, he's involved; Free from ambition, and from worldly views: He places not his mitre next the crown, You view him near the altar, not the throne. Yet will I penetrate yon sacred fane, And call him for a while from holy cares, That thou may'st execute thy pious trust, And do the will of thy dead sire before him. [Exit. SCENE THE SECOND. ARZACES solus. And yet methinks 'tis strange, that I, a soldier, Bred up in camps, and train'd to deeds of blood, Should by my dying father be call'd forth As one most fit for this mysterious work! Now too, when love warming my youthful heart Stamps me his vot'ry, now do I deserve To be the bearer of these holy off'rings, To altars, priests, or our Assyrian gods? SCENE THE THIRD. To him enter the High Priest Oroes, attended by other Priests, and Mithranes. MITHRANES. Behold, my lord, this noble youth's arrived, And brings those relics which you seem to await! ARZACES. Most holy priest of these Caldean shrines, O do not deem their sanctity profaned By a rough soldier's presence, hither borne To obey the mandate of his dying sire, And lay this sacred casket at your feet. âYou loved my father. OROES. Brave and warlike youth, I loved the many virtues of Phradates; But 'tis the gods', and not thy father's will, Have sent thee here. Say, where's thy sacred trust? ARZACES. âBehold it here.â [Two slaves deliver the casket to the Priest. OROES. Is it then ye I touch, Ye ever dear remains? do I once more Bedew you with my tears? Thanks to the gods! âRetire, my friends, and leave us here alone, I have a sacred mystery to unfold. [Exeunt Priests. Behold the seal, The seal of empire, which proclaim'd the laws! And this sad scroll, traced by his dying hands! This diadem, which crown'd his royal brows! Lo here the sword, which overthrew the Mede, And bent the Persian to the Assyrian yoke! But all proved useless to its mighty lord, 'Gainst perfidy, 'gainst death, in lurking poison.â ARZACES. Oh all ye powers!âPoison! OROES. Yes, Arzaces! Long has this dreadful secret been enwrapt In tenfold night, safe kept within my breast; But now the manes of a murder'd king Resume new lifeâTh'offended gods themselves Now cry for vengeance, and their voice is heard Loud issuing thro' the marble jaws of death. ARZACES. Thy words are full of horror, as of truth. Last night as wand'ring near this sacred spot, Too sure I heard shrieks and heart-rending groans, As 'twere within that tombâ OROES. The groans of Ninusâ Thy slaughter'd sovereign groans for just revenge. ARZACES. Yet, Pontiff, say, from whom does he expect it? Or who shall execute his great commands? OROES. The traitors who cut off this best of kings, Have kept conceal'd all traces of their plot, Their guilt lies buried here within the tomb: Men's wisdom is o'er-reach'd, their eyes deceiv'd, But who shall blind th'all-piercing eye of Heaven? ARZACES. I would this hand were doomed the instrument To punish these fell crimes. When I beheld That fatal tomb, and heard those awful sounds, My spirit was disturbedâIs it not lawful To enter here? OROES. Strictly the gods forbid it, The oracle has otherwise decreed; But wait with patience for the hour of justice, That hour shall come, and the high hests of Heaven Shall be perform'dâThe Fates now close my lips, They will unseal them at the appointed time, Then more may be divulgedâPerchance, O youth, It may concern thee nearlyâbut be watchful Least any action, word, or look of thine, Betray this dreadful secret of the tomb. âBehold the palace opensâproud Assures, Attended by a train of courtly slaves, Enters the royal domeâprepares t'infect With baneful flattery our misled Queen. O thou fell monster!âhaughty, subtle villain! ARZACES. What says my lord? OROES. No moreâFarewell!â Bear hence those sacred relics; and when night O'ershades these guilty walls, again we'll meet, Again hold converse in the awful presence Of list'ning gods;âlearn to revere them, youth, For strictly do they watch thee. [Exit Oroes. SCENE THE FOURTH. ARZACES solus. Wherefore me? Curst be this spot where mighty Ninus fell! Curst be the hand which mix'd the deadly draught! âYet why conceal this wretch?âMethought the priest Levelled a foul suspicion at Assures. âHow now, my friend? SCENE THE FIFTH. To him enter Mithranes. MITHRANES. Retire, most noble youth; Assures, sprang from Babylonian kings, The haughty fav'rite of our sovereign, comes: All here respect and dread himâyou yourself, Ev'n without diminution of your glory, May pay that deference which his state demands. ARZACES. Thou counsellest ill, I will not stoop to him; Nor shall my crouching aggrandise his pride. SCENE THE SIXTH. Enter Assures, followed by Cedarus and Nobles. ASSURES. How's thisâArzaces here! at Babylon Without our leave obtain'd?âSay, daring youth, Whence springs this boldness? wherefore have you left Your camps and standards on the Oxine shores? And what wild motive brings you to the court? ARZACES. My services have borne me here, nay more, The Queen's high mandate.â ASSURES. How? the Queen require!â âWell, be it soâbut know from me alone Thou can'st obtain admission to the Queen. What wouldst thou with Semiramis?â ARZACES. I dare To ask the bright reward of all my toils, And humbly sue to serve her.â ASSURES. Thou darest more, Thou dost conceal thy most presumptuous love, Thy passion for Azema.â ARZACES. Yes, I own It is presumption to adore that maid, For I esteem her heart, at which I aim, Beyond the worth or price of empire. ASSURES. Hold. I hope thou know'st not whom thou dar'st insult, Or could'st thou hope to mingle thy vile race With demi-gods o'th'Tigris and Euphrates. âYet I will deign thro' pity to advise thee. When thou behold'st the Queen, I charge thee, youth, Drop not one hint of this thy offensive love, Not on thy lifeâThou'st heard, and now obey. ARZACES. Now rest assured, proud lord, I'll urge my suit With double vigourâI despise your threats, For menaces still strengthen my resolves. Behold in me one who has serv'd the state, Whose arms may have oft protected you, proud lord, And all the silken train within the palace. You deem me rash, perchance, this fire offends, But it shall ne'er be stifledânor shall you E'er teach my neck t'endure a slavish yoke. ASSURES. I will chastise this insolenceâand thou Shalt learn the duty of a subject.â [Exeunt Assures, &amp;c. ARZACES. Well, We both may learn it; I henceforward May learn more prudence, nor again be lavish Of these wild transports of my headstrong ardor; While you may one day prove how great the peril Even for proud statesmen to insult the man Whose arms have triumph'd in his country's cause. [Exit Arzaces. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST continues. Semiramis appears leaning on her Woman, as in the deepest Affliction:âat length she comes forward, followed by Otanes. SEMIRAMIS. Oh that the friendly hand of death would cast His darksome veil o'er these unhappy eyes, Grown dim with tears, and weary of the sun! âIs not Arzaces yet arrived? OTANES. He is; This day, O Queen, he enter'd these proud walls. SEMIRAMIS. 'Tis wellâfor know, Otanes, this dread voice Piercing the ear of night, has warned thy Queen, That when Arzaces should arrive, her woes Should meet a respite, and her torments cease. OTANES. Shall not these tidings then dispel this gloom, And stop the current of these endless tears? SEMIRAMIS. They form a ray of hope, my soul methinks Will lose its terrors in Arzaces' presence. OTANES. Banish all recollection of that deed, Which freed you from the fatal marriage yoke; The act was almost justice, for the King Had basely driv'n you from his bed and throne; And sure the various blessings you've diffused, Join'd to the grateful prayers of many nations, Shall plead so strongly at Heav'n's high tribunal, That were the gods incensed at Ninus' death, They'd blunt the sword of vengeance.âSee Assures, His crime surpasses yours, he mix'd the draught; Yet prosp'rous still, rejoices in his greatness, Nor dreads, nor feels the anger of the gods. SEMIRAMIS. Alas! my guilt was greater, as my ties Were far more sacred, for I was the wife Of murder'd Ninus, and my fix'd despair Accuses me to all the pow'rs of vengeance. I once had hopes, that when my darling son By untimely death was torn from my fond arms, Vengeance divine had ceas'd; but since this phantom, This dreadful vision, has disturb'd my peace, I often seek that tomb, revere from far The ashes of my lord, invoke his shade, Then shrieks, long and loud groans answering my vows, Seem to foretell some dire event.âPerchance The hour's now come to expiate my crime. OTANES. Might not your sorrow conjure up this spirit? Perchance the offspring of your troubled mind? SEMIRAMIS. Too sure these eyes beheld itâ'twas no child Of fancy or of sleep, for sleep has long Fled from these eyelidsâWakeful on my bed, Pondering on my sad lot, I heard a voice Exclaim âArzaces!â at which name did joy Dawn on my heart, that heart which curst Assures Has pierc'd with horror; for I hop'd Arzaces Might dare t'oppose him, and his pow'r restrain, Who, as the foul accomplice of my crime, Aspires to share my scepter;âfor an instant My sorrows ceas'd, when lo in Ninus' form Sudden the minister of death appear'd, His threat'ning sword besmear'd with clotted blood. Methinks ev'n now I view the injur'd shade, Methinks I hear him groan! OTANES. Say, mighty Empress, What did the shade reveal? SEMIRAMIS. He would not speak His direful purpose; therefore I remain'd In dark suspence, dreading uncertain ill, A state so curstâthe heavy load of life Grew irksome;âthirsting then to know my fate, And dreading to consult the sainted pontiff Whom Babylon reveres, Proudly disdaining that a priest should view His monarch trembling in a mortal's presence, I sent to Memphis to consult great Jove, With gifts and incense, tho' too well convinc'd, That neither gifts nor incense can atone For crimes so great as mine. OTANES. Oft do these oracles direct the steps Of erring mortals.â Enter Messenger. MESSENGER. Great Queen, the Egyptian pontiff is arriv'd.â [Exit Messenger. SEMIRAMIS. I go to meet him.âMay the gods remove The veil 'twixt me and fate, and may I read My destiny to come! whether I'm doom'd To sink beneath my suff'rings, or find A period to my sorrows in Arzaces. [Exeunt. SCENE THE SECOND. Arzaces and Azema. AZEMA. To you, Arzaces, this unconquer'd empire Its present splendour owes, and I my freedom; For when the vanquish'd Scythians, to repair Their late defeats, sprang with their treacherous bands Forth from their gloomy caves and dark retreats, With rage redoubled rushing on our troops; Then when my warlike father fell, and left In hopeless slavery the lost Azema, You sent the furious thunder of the war Beyond their desart's bound'ries, and your hands Unloos'd her chains, and satisfied her vengeance. Vast is the debt I owe you, and this heart's Your poor reward. ARZACES. Must I not claim this hand? AZEMA. It ne'er shall be another's;âbut take heed Least this our mutual passion prove our ruin. O let me warn you, that this martial pride, Joined to the lover's softness, may destroy us. They both alike incense a dangerous rival, Too great t'oppose or cope withâvile Assures. ARZACES. Is then that insolent, ambitious man My rival as my foe? AZEMA. 'Tis true, ambition lords it o'er his mind, He pants for royal power, and seeks my hand Faster to grasp the scepter in his own. But trust me, my Arzaces, if the prince, He whom great Ninus destin'd from his birth, Would wed Azema; if this empire's heir Were yet alive, and in his mother's court, If with his diadem his heart he proffer'd; I call the conscious powers of love to witness, I would disdain them both, and would prefer Exile with thee, before a throne with him. ARZACES. Benignant gods! 'tis now that I am blest: While thus I triumph in Azema's heart, How much I soar above th'ambitious hopes Of fell Assures!â AZEMA. Yet let me conjure you To dread his vengeance, which will know no bounds Towards his love's rivalâwhom, from other motives, Ev'n now he hates, and labours to destroy. ARZACES. I hate him more, but ne'er can learn to fear him. The Queen between us, with most even hand, Doth poize the balance of her royal favour. Soon as I prostrate fell before her throne, With her own hand she rais'd me from the earth, And oft she call'd me her victorious soldier, Her kingdom's best support. Yes, my Azema, I heard my praises issue from those lips, Which mightiest sovereigns glory to obey. AZEMA. These tidings cheer my heart; for if the Queen Deigns to protect, in vain Assures threatens. ARZACES. Embolden'd by her goodness, at her feet I meant t'implore her to complete our union. But ere I spoke, behold a priest approach'd, Bearing great Ammon's oracle. The Queen With trembling hands unseal'd the scroll, let fall Some precious tears, and fix'de her watry eyes Long time on me, with marvellous attention, Then sigh'd, and fled my sight. What this should mean I know not; yet I deeply mourn her fate. AZEMA. Leave her not to Assures, and his counsels; He may prevent her good intents. My pray'rs shall aid my wishes and my hopes; I feel in loving you I please the gods. Now let the vanquish'd East fall down and worship Divine SemiramisâI am more great; The world is at her feet, but you at mine. ARZACES. Behold the traitor comes!âat his appearance My soul is seized with an unwonted horror. SCENE THE SECOND. Enter Assures. ASSURES. It seems on thee high honours have been lavish'd, For which ev'n kings themselves have sigh'd in vain. Nay, thou hast dar'd presumptuously to rival High-born Assures in Azema's love. ARZACES. I've learnt, it's true, to honour and revere That race from which you sprang, your rank and blood; But in despite of all these rights you boast, I dare put in my claim, I love the maid; And I could add, if like a peaceful courtier I chose to vaunt before her, I upheld That throne which you, Assures, hope t'ascend. And now I haste t'obey Azema's orders. By her and by Semiramis alone I am commanded. You perchance hereafter May wield the scepter, but ne'er hope to rank Arzaces in the number of your subjects. Thou may'st be kingâfor oft the gods in wrath Do monarchs give as scourges to mankind. [Exit. SCENE THE THIRD. Azema and Assures. ASSURES. His insolence too long has been endured. But may I now hold converse with Azema, On subjects far more worthy her attention? AZEMA. Can there be theme more glorious? Speak, my lord, I am all attention. ASSURES. O let no trifling cares usurp your thoughts, The world's great guidance, universal sway Shall soon call on us, and shall occupy Each vast idea.âLo! Semiramis Is but the shadow of herself, high Heaven Seems to debase her greatness, and that star Which long has shone with undiminish'd blaze The glory of our hemisphere, has lost Its wonted lustre, and now hasting on Towards its decline, shall set in endless night. AZEMA. My lord, I am not skill'd in state intrigues, But know not why you deem yourself impower'd To tax my sighs, or read my virgin thoughts. ASSURES. Cherish aspiring thoughts, thoughts worthy kings. The fate of empire hangs upon our union: For now I speak to mighty kings and heroes, And all the demi-gods from whom you sprang. Too long a woman trampling on their ashes, Usurping pow'r to which we should lay claim, Has held enthrall'd the nations of the earth. Complete the work then of her falling greatness. Time was, she had your charms; assume her courage. Love should not dare present himself before you In aught but in a monarch's form. That crown I tender, and I trust you'll not prefer A rude barbarian? AZEMA. Peace, peace, Assures. Shall I contemn the glory, and disgrace The names recorded by eternal fame Of my great ancestors? Though I deny That in the blazon of that glorious strain One could be found of more exalted soul, Than him you dare miscall a rude barbarian. For me, when Fate decrees that I must wed, 'Tis for Semiramis to guide my choice. You say the gods are all incensed against her. I know not for what crime; but this I know, That thou wilt never be the chosen man, The holy seer commission'd by the Fates To point the thunder of avenging Jove. [Exit. SCENE THE FOURTH. Manet Assures. To him enter Cedarus. ASSURES. Well, faithful Cedarus, say, what success? Say, will the seeds of hatred and rebellion Which we have sown in men's distemper'd bosoms, Will they spring up, will they ere long bring forth The fruits of discord and intestine war? CEDARUS. I dare hope much, my lordâat length the people Break their long silence, and, impress'd no more By that dread awe in which the vaunted name Of great Semiramis had bound their senses, They now demand to know this empire's heir; Say they must have a king to hold their scepter, And that Semiramis must name Assures. ASSURES. O source of endless shame!âmust then my glory, My rank, my very fate, depend on her? Was it for this, ye powers, I murder'd Ninus, And, wading deeper thro' the sea of blood, Cut off his infant son, and so removed My only barrier to th'Imperial throne? Have I done this to crawl in Babylon, To be a subject? CEDARUS. Check th'ignoble thought. ASSURES. Spite of myself I am compell'd to praise her; For, Cedarus, I've seen this godlike woman, When the vast empire like a drunkard reel'd, And as a coward shook with rude commotion, Into her hands take the disjointed rule, With the sharp sword of justice mow oppression, Stop all the various sources of corruption, Silence the murmurers, stifle the tumults, And with such art and wisdom mould the state, That peace and order have embrac'd each other. CEDARUS. But now her genius grovels in the dust. ASSURES. Behold in me a mighty minister, But robb'd of power; a prince but without subjects; Encircled with high honours, yet dependant. But woe befall her, if th'ungrateful woman Drives to extremes her desperate confederate. SCENE THE FIFTH. To them enter Otanes. OTANES. My lord, the Queen requires your private ear. ASSURES. Lo! she appears! Retire good Cedarus. [Exit Cedarus. SCENE THE SIXTH. To him enter Semiramis. SEMIRAMIS. My lord, at length I must unfold that heart Which in your presence has absorb'd its grief. I've govern'd Asia, and perhaps with glory; You too have borne the weight of this vast empire. Long have I liv'd so blest, that I forgot The dreadful step which rais'd me to this height. I was unmindful that the gods were just. But now Heaven speaks, I yield, and this great kingdom Will soon be strengthen'd, even from its foundation. ASSURES. It is a part that's worthy of my Queen To finish this her glorious workâbut say, What power is able to obscure that glory? The earth obeys you, what d'ye fear from Heaven? SEMIRAMIS. Can you ask this, while you behold yon tomb? ASSURES. I must confess I cannot bear with patience To be reminded that once Ninus reign'd. For fifteen years that king has slept in peace, And do we fear his shade should burst the tomb, And come thus late to cry to man for vengeance? No fears like these should shake your daring soul; But if 'tis now intent on nobler plans, If you'd perpetuate the blood of Belus, If fair Azema's claim to this high rankâ SEMIRAMIS. Aye, that's my themeâGreat Jove, and Babylon, Demand without delay the scepter's heir, And I must chuse a partner of my throne. You know my pride, and my unconquer'd spirit, Have made it long their law to reign alone; But now Heaven's voice assists my people's prayers, I must divide my powerâ'Tis you, my lord, Who best may claim the title of a king; You're next in power on earth, but not my equal. It is enough, and I've the pride to think That rank may satisfy your vast ambition. ASSURES. Great are your favours, Queen, great my deserts; For you I've dy'd my hands with royal blood, And shall I not receive the bright reward Of this bold deed? SEMIRAMIS. Hear Great Ammon's oracle, and know my will. [Reads.] âAll Babylon shall wear a face of joy, âWhen the sad mother, and more cruel wife, âShall light once more the Hymeneal torch. âThen shall she calm the restless shade of Ninus.â Such are the eternal orders of the gods. This day, I mean to give the world a lord; My choice may fall on you, or on another, In all things I'll assert my sovereign power, But chiefly in this act.âDo you give orders The princes and the magistrait assemble. This day the offended gods shall be appeas'd, But 'tis repentance only can disarm them; And trust me, that remorse which you despise Is the last virtue which the guilty boast. You deem me weak and timid, but alas Fear ever dwells with crimes. This very fear Adds lustre to my crownâand 'twould become thee, Humbling thyself, to deprecate Heaven's vengeance. [Exit. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Manet ASSURES. I must not wed Azemaâfor the Queen Fixes on me to share her bed and throne. What all my pains, join'd to our mutual crimes, Could ne'er effect, behold an idle dream, And an Egyptian oracle, bring forth!â What power unknown directs the deeds of mortals! What feeble springs act on our great designs! Still must I doubt.âOnce more I'll see the Queen, Strive craftily to read her dark intents, Watch all the secret workings of her soul, And from her great resolves arrange my own. [Exit. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. A Royal Gallery in the Palace. Enter Semiramis and Otanes. SEMIRAMIS. Who would believe, Otanes, that the gods, Offended as they are at my transgressions, Would deign to shed a ray of comfort round me, And cheer with hope my dark, despairing soul? The hand of Heaven has led Arzaces hither; Doubtless 'tis they dispose of human hearts; And mine exults t'obey their sacred laws. My fate is fix'd, I yield, and I behold Mine and the world's great master in Arzaces. OTANES. In him! in young Arzaces? SEMIRAMIS. Yes, Otanes. When Persia was reveng'd, and Asia conquer'd, This hero fought on the rude plains of Scythia; Surrounded as he was by death and carnage, And crown'd with laurels, yet his youthful front Was crimson'd with the blush of modesty. At the first glance of this young hero's charms, Wonder and joy seized on my astonished senses; All other men were objects of my scorn, While something seem'd to whisper to my soul, To favour and protect him from this instant. This did not 'scape the cunning of Assures, He hates the noble youthâwhose glorious image Was 'graven on my heart, long ere I knew That Heaven had doom'd him to partake my throne. OTANES. Is it decreed then that your daring spirit, Your proud unconquer'd heart, at last should yield? SEMIRAMIS. Noâ'tis not love inclines me toward Arzaces; I pay to beauty the reward of valour. Is't for a wretch like me, to yield to love? To own its fatal laws, and court its bonds? Hast thou forgot, that I was once a mother? Hast thou forgot, that scarce these wretched arms Embrac'd the fruit of my unhappy union, When Heav'n in anger tore him from my bosom? OTANES. The world has long bewail'd the prince's loss. SEMIRAMIS. Mankind had cause to mournâwhat then had I? I fled my court, I wish'd to fly myself; I sought repose amidst these sacred tombs, But rest fled from meânow with joy and wonder I see soft Peace return to cheer my soul; The gentle goddess comes, and with her brings Divine Arzaces, to dispel my sorrows. OTANES. This deed of thine, O Queen, will cause the heart Of proud Assures to o'erflow with rage. The people's voice, joined to his own ambition, Have taught him long to cherish the fond hope That he should prove your choice. SEMIRAMIS. I've not deceiv'd him, And know, Otanes, I disdain to fear him. I am no stranger to his tow'ring views, But still I've set due bounds to his ambition. What shall I dread then?âshall he dare t'oppose Semiramis, united with Arzaces? 'Twould prove an insult to the sacred shade Of my dead lord, to wed with his assassin. The oracles of Jove approve Arzaces, And Ninus quits the bosom of the tomb, To urge this union.âNow no more I'm aw'd By the superior virtue of the pontiff; I bad him strait attend to know my will. OTANES. The holy priest approachesâhe'll declare If this your choice be pleasing to the gods. [Exit Otanes. SCENE THE SECOND. Enter Oroes to Semiramis. SEMIRAMIS. August successor of great Zoroaster, This day I mean to name the Assyrian king; 'Tis yours to place the diadem on his brows. Is all prepar'd for this solemnity? OROES. The magi and the nobles are assembled; Your will is done, and there my duty ends. I'm bound to obey, but not to judge our monarchs; That task is fitting only for the gods. SEMIRAMIS. These obscure phrases, this mysterious language, Shew that in secret you condemn my choice. OROES. I know it notâO may it prove a bless'd one! SEMIRAMIS. The oracle demands a sacrifice. OROES. True, mighty Queen; Ammon shall be obey'd. SEMIRAMIS. Say, venerable pontiffâhave the sacred altars This morn receiv'd the off'rings of Arzaces? OROES. They have, O Queen,âand Heaven doth hold them precious; He and his gifts are pleasing to the gods. SEMIRAMIS. I do believe theeâand thy sayings, priest, Do cheer my soul.âMay I not trust Arzaces? OROES. He is the firmest pillar of the state; The gods have led him hither, and his glory Is their own work. SEMIRAMIS. With joy, with heart-felt transport My ears imbibe these tidingsâHope and peace Shall calm ere long the tempest in my soul. Haste, and let all your altars smoke with incense, Your holy roofs resound with notes of praise. And strait do thou and all the magi join In supplications to the gentle gods To shed their choicest blessings on these nuptials. [Exit Oroes. SCENE THE THIRD. Manet Semiramis. SEMIRAMIS. The gods smile on me while I chuse Arzaces. Thus I become the minister of Heaven. How will this sudden, this unhop'd-for greatness, Fill his astonish'd soul with joy and wonder! How will Assures and his minions droop, When ev'n the man whom most they hate shall rule them! SCENE THE FOURTH. Enter Otanes. OTANES. Arzaces waits your will. SEMIRAMIS. Bid him approach. Ye gods, defenders of the Assyrian throne! Who now inspire me, and direct my deeds: Thou restless spirit of the murder'd Ninus, And thou, O blessed shade of my dead son, Unite your powers, and favour my Arzaces. SCENE THE FIFTH. Enter Arzaces. Kneels before her. ARZACES. O Queen, my life's devoted to your service, I owe you all my blood. When I've beheld Its purple drops gush forth, I've been o'erpaid, Since 'twas for you it flow'd.âMy warlike father, Leading your troops to conquest, fell in battle. But wherefore dare I to remind my sovereign Of my dead father's merits?âWill she therefore Deign to forgive the rashness of his son, Who even now thus prostrate at her feet, Dreads to offend her, and to urge his suit?â SEMIRAMIS. Rise, Arzaces! Thou surely ne'er wast born to give offence. Dismiss thy fear, and boldly name thy suit. ARZACES. This day, O Queen, you give your hand and empire; The proud Assures now prepares to triumph; Hither ev'n now he bends his haughty steps, As 'twere to claim the conquest. The whole realm Have fix'd on him, as sprang from your high blood, To share your throne;âmay he prove worthy of it! But O, I feel my mind is too exalted Here to adore the man whose power I've braved. Suffer me then to fly his hated presence, And seek that land where late I fought your battles. Tho' I might well defy his tyranny, If you, O Queen, would crown my aspiring wishes And grant meâ SEMIRAMIS. Gracious powers! what do I hear! Would'st thou then fly my court? Say, would'st thou leave me? And can'st thou dread Assures? ARZACES. NoâI'm doomed To fear nought else on earth, except your anger. But now perchance my vain desires are known, Your indignation may destroy my hopes, I trembleâ SEMIRAMIS. Thou hast no causeâere long you'll find Assures is not destined for thy sov'reign. ARZACES. 'Tis wellâfor I must own, with ten-fold horror I should have seen him fill the throne of Ninus. But since 'tis now forbad him to aspire To these august espousals, is't decreed That he must therefore wed the fair Azema? Pardon, O Queen, th'excess of my presumption. Tho' but a subjectâyet 'gainst him I durstâ SEMIRAMIS. Subjects like you, are pillars to my throne. My eyes are now enlighten'd, and I view What tends to the true interests of the state. I name you arbiter; you shall support them. My word shall break the concord 'twixt the princess And proud AssuresâTrust me, I've foreseen And will prevent the dangers of this union. ARZACES. And shall this curst alliance then be broken? Now I perceive thy penetrating wisdom Reads my desires, and dives into my soul. SEMIRAMIS. Here break we offâere now the hall of audience Is fill'd with nobles, and Assyrian princes, Follow, Arzaces: let us haste to join them, And witness with them my august decision. [Exeunt. SCENE THE SIXTH. The Scene draws and discovers a large magnificent Saloon. Many of the great Officers of State enter in Procession, bearing the Marks and Ensigns of their Dignityâthen enter Oroes, with the other Priests âA Throne is raised in the Midst of the Salloon, on which the Queen having seated herself, is surrounded by Azema and her Women. The Satraps are placed next the Throne, with Assures and Arzaces, Guards and Attendants. OROES. Princes! priests! warriors! Babylon's support! Here by the Queen's command this hour assembled, To you great Jove's decree shall be reveal'd. The gods themselves watch o'er this mighty empire, And now the great, the important day's arrived, Which they have destin'd shall new mould the state. He whom the Queen shall deem most fit to rule, He whom she chuse to share her bed and throne, Our part is to obey.âLo, in the name Of all the magi do I bring that homage Due to our monarchâprayers, and pious vows, For her own safety, and this kingdom's welfare. AZEMA. Ev'n now, my Lords, the Queen shall name your sovereign. Th'imperial choice can injure only me; But I was born her subject, and remain so. ASSURES. Whate'er may be the mystic will of Heaven, Who this auspicious day directs our monarch, We're bound t'obeyâSwear we then by this throne, And by the name of great Semiramis, Humbly to yield to her sublime commands, To own 'tis justice, to submit in silence. ARZACES. I swearâand this my arm, and my good sword, With every drop of blood within these veins, I dedicate henceforth to my new King, With that same duty, and that heart-felt zeal, With which they long have strove to serve my Queen. OROES. We wait the will of Heaven, and our Sov'reign. SEMIRAMIS. Princes, and ye most holy priests, attend. If now for more than fifteen years the world, Fill'd with my glories and my great exploits, Has seen, and has rever'd, the sword and scepter Placed in a woman's hand, ev'n in that hand Which tyrant custom, and the laws of Ninus, Had destin'd to the distaff;âif alone (Surpassing ev'n my subjects' fondest hopes) I have sustain'd the weight of this vast empire, Throughout the world victorious and adored, I've scorn'd t'accept a partner in my greatness; Yet now this empire shall acquire new force, Since, in obedience to great Jove's decree, I deign to give my hand, and share my power. I might have chosen a husband from the kings Whose states surround the borders of my realms; But they're my tributaries, or my foes. My scepter is not made for foreign hands; My subjects are far greater in my eyes Than all these petty kings, which their brave arms Can conquer and enslave;âtherefore this hour My diadem shall bind a subject's brows. Say, is there one amongst you who presumes, Ev'n though in secret, to condemn my purpose? ASSURES. No, mighty Queen, all must applaud the deed, And own the wisdom of their monarch's choice. SEMIRAMIS. Belus was born a subject, and his crown He ow'd to his own merits, and his people: 'Tis by those very rights that now I reign, And sway a mightier scepter.âI have taught Full twenty eastern Kings to own your laws, Nations far distant, and unknown to Belus; It was for me to finish his great works. And now, my people, you demand the hero, Worthy to rule this wide-extended empire, Worthy his subjects, and the hand that crowns him. ARZACES. With deference we wait your great commands. SEMIRAMIS. Sages, and legislators of the land! The oracle of thunder-bearing Jove, The welfare of this state, the world's great interest, All these have I consulted; they decree This union shall effect a general good, And shed unnumber'd blessings on mankind. Haste and adore this hero who shall rule ye; In him the princes of my race revive: My husband, and this monarch isâArzaces. [She descends from the throne, and they all rise. AZEMA. O perfidy! Arzaces! ASSURES. O for vengeance! ARZACES to AZEMA. Trust me, my love, my faith's inviolate. OROES. Just Heaven, dispel these horrors! SEMIRAMIS to the Priests. O ye, who sanctify the purest vows, Now plight our faiths, and join our willing hands. [It thunders. OROES. Break off these rites, for Heaven itself frowns on them. Depart we, mighty Empress; on this instant Seek we great Ninus' tomb, and to his shade, Strait offer pious prayers, with vows and incense. [Exeunt the Queen and Arzaces, followed by Oroes. The Scene shuts.âManent Assures and Azema, &amp;c. AZEMA. Gods, is it possible! is this the prince So warlike, so renown'd? is he confederate With a deceitful Queen and crafty Priest? And will they dare usurp the name of Heav'n To give some colour to their dark proceedings? ASSURES. Such is their plan; and rest assured, sage princess, 'Tis meet we should compose our amorous broils, And re-unite these hands, which this rough soldier Has, by his presence, rudely torn asunder. AZEMA. Say I should yield, what good shall thence accrue To poor Azema? ASSURES. Ask you this, bright maid? Our mutual strength and pow'r will prove too strong For this bold youth to opposeâand shou'd the Queen Vainly presume to uphold her daring ruffian, She then will feel what 'tis to insult Assures. But can Azema lose her sex's pride? Can she forget her youth, her charms disgrac'd? Say will not this inspire a cold contempt, And teach her heart to feel its mighty wrongs? AZEMA. Alas! the traitor takes my lover's part, And fain wou'd cherish the false hopes he gave me. ASSURES. Away with love, when love repays it not; 'Tis the mind's sickness, worthy vulgar souls. Azema, sprung from heroes and from kings, Shou'd soar above her sex's common views. Her every wish should comprehend a world; Empire and universal sway her object? Such do I bring, such offer to her beauty; Nay more, the godlike joy of just revenge! AZEMA. Revenge! ye pow'rs, on whom? on my Arzaces? Alas, my perjur'd love! ambition may Cancel thy vows, tho' register'd in Heaven; Unshaken still, mine shall defy its power. Be false and safe, 'tis man's prerogative; But let Azema prove her sex's virtue, And faith, tho' injur'd, triumph over falsehood. [Exit. ASSURES. Curse on the wayward sex, she loves him still, Nor can my arts subvert her girlish passion. Then be it so; sure means shall be employ'd. True politicians first essay to gain Their fav'rite points by stratagem and cunning; Yet disappointed, never quit their aim, But boldly re-assume the road of pow'r. Come then Revenge! Ambition fire my soul! At once be all its feelings gratified. The stripling who has dar'd to brave my vengeance, This hour shall feel it; and with heart-felt transport I'll give him death, and mount the throne of Ninus. [Exit. Scene opens, and discovers the Tomb, at which are Semiramis, Arzaces, and Oroes. SEMIRAMIS. Yet, Oroes, hold; for wherefore shou'd we pause To know Jove's will, for what his oracle So late declar'd. This hand is thine, Arzaces. And now I charge thee by thy function, Pontiffâ [It thunders, and the shade of Ninus appears. It is the voice of Jove; he speaks in thunder. See, the tomb opens, and the hallow'd shade Of my dead lord bursts forth!âI faintâI die. ARZACES. Lo where I stand!âlook down, O sacred phantom, Speak, and reveal thy terrible commands. SEMIRAMIS. O speak thy dreadful errand. Art thou come To pardon or destroy?â Judge if this hero well deserves thy crown. Pronounce, I am bound t'obeyâ SHADE to ARZACES. It is decreed That thou shalt reign, Arzaces; but thou'rt doom'd To expiate first fell crimes and blackest treasons. There is a sacrifice thou must perform Here in my tomb, and to my sacred ashes, And serve thereby me and my sonâbe mindful Of thy dead King, and listen to the Pontiff. ARZACES. Blest Shade, whom I revere, whose matchless spirit Inhabits yet, and animates these climes, This thy strange visitation doth not shake My soul with fear, but fills it with new strength. And here I swear to do thy sacred will, Tho' peril, or the death, await the act. Speak hero, demi-godâO name the task To which this arm is destin'd.â SEMIRAMIS. [kneels.] Mighty Ninus, Suffer thy wife thus prostrate on the earth, If deep contrition, and if heart-felt sorrow, If I've not sinn'd beyond all hopesâ SHADE. Forbear; But rest assur'd the hour now hastens on When 'twill be lawful for thee to descend Into this house of death. [He re-enters, and the Mausoleum closes. SEMIRAMIS. Haste, Pontiff, haste! Bid all the magi follow to the temple; Speak comfort to my people, calm their fears! My husband's manes yet may be appeas'd, They favour me since they protect Arzaces. The gods inspire me, Ammon names your King. Do present sacrifice, let victims bleed! And with fit orisons implore great Jove To bless that monarch he himself hath chosen. [Exit. End of the third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Enter Arzaces and Azema. ARZACES. O add not to the burthen of my woes By thy severe reproaches and complaints. This oracle is more replete with horror Than thou conceiv'st.âAstonish'd nature groans With endless prodigiesâWhile my own grief Lays heavy on my soul, the cruel gods Have ravish'd from me all my fondest wishes; I have lost Azemaâ AZEMA. Cease, thou perjur'd man, Cease to increase the horrors of this day, By bringing thy false love to my remembrance. I do not mean to oppose the hand that crowns thee, Much less to thwart the sacred will of Ninus. Of all the prodigies I've this day seen, That which most tends to freeze my soul with horror Is thy inconstancy, thy barbarous falshood. Complete thy work, say Ninus bids thee strike. Begin by me thy horrid sacrifice; Strike, thou base ingrate. ARZACES. Gods, it is too much. 'Gainst the sharp arrows of all other woes, Methinks my sad despairing breast was arm'd, But O, what shield shall blunt the poison'd shafts Levell'd against me by Azema's rage? Judge of my grief at the Queen's fatal choice, Judge of the precipice to which it drives me. Now hear what Heaven decrees. AZEMA. I've heard already. ARZACES. This empire is not destin'd to my rule, Nor shalt thou sway its scepterâfor the son Of royal Ninus, whom I've sworn to serve, He who was born my rival and my master, Yet lives. AZEMA. Ye mighty gods! does the prince live? ARZACES. He breathes, he livesâere long he shall appear Within these walls. AZEMA. And sad Semiramis? ARZACES. Thus long deceiv'd has mourn'd for her lost son. As yet he knows not this important secret, Which has lain buried in the pontiff's breast. AZEMA. Alas, these mysteries perplex my soul, For the Queen weds thee, and the shade of Ninus Foretold that thou should'st reignâ ARZACES. But Ninus' son Is destin'd for thy husband.âWho can unfold These dreadful prophecies, and dark predictions? AZEMA. Yet speak, declareâwhy comes he not this instant? What secret mystery conceals the monarch? Not he himself, nor great Semiramis, Should tempt me to forget my vows to thee, And by black perjury defile my soul. And now, Arzaces, deeply probe thy heart, There read, if thy fond passion equals mine. And now farewellâgo and receive the sentence Which angry Ninus threatens to pronounce. Thy lot depends on Heaven, my fate on thee. [Exit Azema. ARZACES. Arzaces is thy own.âStay, cruel maidâ Methinks my soul's bewilder'd, and I'm lost In this strange mixture of delights and horrors! But see where Oroes comes to clear my doubts, And calm my restless mind!â SCENE THE SECOND. Enter Oroes, bearing the Offerings of Arzaces. ARZACES. O holy father, Remove this dreadful darkness from my eyes, And snatch me from the abyss in which I'm plung'd. OROES. The hour now comes, my son, when that dark veil Which thus obscures thy sight, shall be remov'd. Now in his dismal, his profound abode, Ninus expects thee, from thy hand awaits The offering, and the destined sacrifice Reserv'd by fate to appease his injur'd manes. ARZACES. O name this offering which his shade demands. But sure it ill becomes me to revenge The wrongs of Ninus, while his son survives. OROES. 'Tis his sire Who now by me issues his dread commands. Thy part is to obey. Some half hour hence Be found near Ninus' tomb, armed with this sword, This sacred steel, which well becomes thy hand; Thy warlike front, bound with this diadem, Which heretofore the brows of Ninus graced, Which thou brought'st hither. ARZACES. But say, wherefore thus? Why with the crown of Ninus deck my temples? OROES. 'Tis so decreedâ Within that tomb the victim will be found, Whose blood thou hast swore to shedâfear not, but strike, Great Ninus' manes shall direct the blow. ARZACES. Should he demand my blood I will obey him. But yet thou speak'st not to me of the young prince, Nor hast thou yet reveal'd from what strange cause Ninus approves that I should wed the Queen, Or how by such espousals I shall reign? OROES. Thou wed Semiramis!âat thought of this The infernal powers themselves turn pale with horror. Now read thy fate, Arzaces. Know too, that this vile womanâ ARZACES. Who, the Queen? OROES. Cut short the thread of her dear husband's life, And robb'd the world of Ninusâbase Assures Mixt the curst draught, and minister'd the poison. ARZACES, after a short Pause. This crimes suits the fell nature of Assures. But can I think this Queen, this wife of Ninus, So lov'd of nations, so rever'd by monarchs, Would e'en attempt a deed more black than hell, And dye her guilty hands in her King's blood? OROES. This doubt, O youth, proclaims thy noble soul, But now 'twould ill become me to dissemble: Cease then to wonder if offended Ninus Rises from death, and once again revisits These guilty wallsâhe rises to forbid This monstrous unionâcomes to rend asunder These chains of wedlock by the Furies forg'd: He comes to save his son from horrid incest. Hark! now he speaks! he warns thee! he's thy fatherâ Thou art thyself the princeâthe Queen's thy mother. NINIAS. Thou hast spoke poniards, priest!âWounded at once With all these mortal strokesâI stand envelop'd By these dark shades of death, and tenfold horror! Can it be possible that I am the son Of murder'd Ninus? OROES. Thou'rt his royal offspring: And know, O prince, that when thy godlike sire Perceiv'd the effect of the too subtle poison, And with accumulated grief beheld That a like baneful and destructive draught Attacked the sources of thy infant life, He snatched thee dying from this impious court. But while all Babylon deplor'd thy loss, Thou wast committed to the pious care Of good Phradatesâwho with healing juices Of plants and herbs known to the Persian sages, Expell'd the deadly venom from thy veins, And having lost his only son in battle, He adopted thee, and call'd thee in Arzaces. NINIAS. O loyal act!âhe was indeed my father. What if Assures prove the only traitor, If he alone were guilty? [Oroes giving him a Scroll. View this scroll, Behold these sacred characters, Arzaces; Can'st thou still doubt? NINIAS. Give me the writing, and thereby root out The last remains of hopes, and flatt'ring doubts. [Reads.] âExpiring Ninus to the true Phradates. âI die by poisonâO preserve my son, âHaste to snatch Ninias from his murderers. âMy guilty wifeââ OROES. Dost thou lack further proof? Thou know'st 'twas from thy hand that I receiv'd This dreadful testimonyâwhich the monarch Had surely finish'dâbut that death approach'd And froze his feeble hand.âFear nought but guilt. Go on, brave prince, while thro' this night of horrors The great gods Themselves shall guide theeâMark'd with Heaven's seal, To thee th'immutable decrees of fate Are now intrustedâyet thou art but mortal, Ordain'd the feeble instrument of vengeance; 'Tis not for thee to interrogate great Jove. Remember, prince, thou hast been sav'd from death; Therefore exalt thy voice in grateful praise; Think what thou ow'st to Heaven, nor dare to murmur. [Exit Oroes. SCENE THE THIRD. NINIAS. Noânought shall e'er restore my pristine peace. O dreadful thought! Semiramis my mother! SCENE THE FOURTH. To him enter Semiramis. SEMIRAMIS. The Hymenal rites now wait thy presence, Great monarch of the earthâhaste to the altar, Thy fate and mine, join'd to the kingdom's welfare, Depend on this our unionâLo, with transport I see the pontiff's hallow'd hands have placed That sacred diadem on thy browâsure proof That Heaven approves, and doth confirm my choice. Even the daring party of Assures, Struck with religious awe, falls down and trembles. The people's hands, their very hearts are ours; You reign securely, and your Queen adores thee; In vain Assures rages.â NINIAS. Curst Assures, Why do I thus delay to seek the monster? Now shall he make atonement, and wash out The filthy stains of parricide and treason In his perfidious blood;âthe shade of Ninus Shall be appeas'd. SEMIRAMIS. How's this?âthe shade of Ninus! Just Heaven! I named not Ninusâ'twas Assures. Why are those eyes fix'd as in anger on me? Is this the tender, the submissive heart, Which I so fondly hoped thou would'st have offer'd, And which from thee had proved a grateful tribute To her who gave thee empire? Dismiss thy fears of Ninus, and his anger, And let me find new comfort in thy arms, My woe's last refuge!âmy belov'd Arzaces; My kingdom's best support, my lord, my husband! NINIAS. [turning from her.] It is too much; forbear, I charge thee. SEMIRAMIS. Why is my lord abandon'd thus to sorrow? NINIAS. Hear me, Semiramis! SEMIRAMIS. I'm all attention. NINIAS. Alas! I've not the power to speak my purpose; Doom me to death, or fly my sight for ever. SEMIRAMIS. For pity's sake, my lord, reveal the cause Of this disorder in your troubled senses: The traces of despair are in your visage, Those fatal glances freeze my soul with horror. Some unknown power, with force invincible, Drags me towards you, and at the same instant Tears me from your embrace, seeming to join The deadliest terror to the purest love. NINIAS. Leave and abhor me. SEMIRAMIS. Ha! what that writing, that On which so oft you cast your angry eyes, And moisten with your tears? Does it contain The cause of all your woe? NINIAS. Too sure it does. Dar'st thou peruse it? SEMIRAMIS. Wherefore should I fear? Whence hadst thou it? NINIAS. It was the gift of Heaven. SEMIRAMIS. Whose characters are these? NINIAS. They areâmy father's. SEMIRAMIS. What say'st thou? NINIAS. Tremble! SEMIRAMIS. Let me read my fate. NINIAS. Forbearâeach word's a poniard to thy soul. SEMIRAMIS. I care notâthou shalt solve my dreadful doubts. If still thou dost resistâI deem thee guilty. NINIAS. Great gods, who guide my deeds, 'tis ye who force me! Take itâand may the pangs which it shall cause, Prove the sole punishment which heavenly justice Reserves for thy high crimes. SEMIRAMIS. What do I see! Support me. NINIAS. 'Tis reveal'd. SEMIRAMIS. [after a long silence, recovering.] It is my son!âDelay notâbut fulfil Thy destiny. Now do the work of Fate, Punish this guilty, this accursed wretch, Revenge thy father's most unnatural murder; Prove thou art his son, and pierce thy mother's breast. NINIAS. O sooner shall my sword drain the last drop Of that unhappy blood which flow'd from thine; Sooner this heart shall bleed, which still retains The sacred stamp and duty of a son. SEMIRAMIS. [falling on her knees.] Behold thy mother kneeling on the earth Entreats her son to strike, and to appease The manes of great Ninus!âGracious powers, What is't I see? thy tears mingling with mine! O day replete with horror and with transport! Yet, Ninias, ere thou giv'st the death I ask, Let Nature's powerful voice once more address thee; Permit, at least, thy guilty mother's tears To bathe this hand, so fatal, so belov'd. NINIAS. [raising her.] Forget not I'm your son;âit ill becomes you T'embrace my knees, and sue to me for pardon. Be patient, and lay comfort to your soul; You've this day gain'd a new and loyal subject. Heaven is appeas'd, and has restor'd your son. But O, I warn you, sacrifice Assures To that relenting God who pardons thee. SEMIRAMIS. This goodness is unhoped forâyet, my son, Let me make some atonement for my crimes, And to thy hands this instant yield that scepter Which has too long been sullied in my own. NINIAS. Forbear! forbear! Still shalt thou reign our Empress, Whilst I with all the sons of Asia join T'admire the wisdom of thy rule SEMIRAMIS. It must not beâHast thou forgot, my son, What Ninus has decreed?âhow he foretold That thou should'st fill my throne?âBeware, my son, How you insult his shade! NINIAS. He shall be soften'd By his son's tears, and by his wife's remorse. And oh! my Queen, my mother, calm thy grief! And in the name of every God I charge thee Keep safe this secret in thy faithful breast, And hide this dreadful myst'ry from the world. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. An Apartment in the Palace. Semiramis and Otanes discover'd. OTANES. Be comforted, O Queen! SEMIRAMIS. Never again Shall peace or joy their welcome visit pay To guilt like mine. Say, is that wretch Assures yet inform'd Of all these strange events?âand do my people Know that Arzaces is their long-lost prince? OTANES. No tongue has yet reveal'd the horrid secret. The people, as some oracle, adore The shade of Ninus; but they strive in vain To fathom its impenetrable meaning, And prostrate at the altars they remain, Till yonder tomb shall ope its pond'rous jaws T'admit the princeâwho with the holy pontiff Entreats the gods to fortify his arm, And grant him power to strike the unknown victim. SEMIRAMIS. But where's Assures, and the fair Azema? OTANES. With horror in her looks, death in her eyes, Azema wanders near the sacred tomb, And ever and anon in fervent prayers Entreats great Jove to shield her dear Arzaces. SEMIRAMIS. O shade of my dead lord! thou read'st my heart, Thou see'st that tho' 'twas pityless towards thee, It boasts at least the feelings of a mother. [Exit Otanes. SCENE THE SECOND. To her enterâAzema hastily. AZEMA. Forgive me, gracious Queen, if I presume To rush into your presence.âThis sad heart Is rack'd with doubts and agonizing fears, Permit me then to fall thus at your feet. [Kneels. SEMIRAMIS. Rise, princess, rise, and speak your pious wishes. AZEMA. O snatch a hero from impending danger, Step between him and guilt, and save Arzaces! SEMIRAMIS. Arzaces! what of him?âthou ravest. AZEMA. This day I know he is destin'd to become your husband. SEMIRAMIS. I wed Arzaces! O ye immortal godsâ AZEMA. Ev'n now the priest Prepares the nuptial ritesâ SEMIRAMIS. These rites are dreadful, Arzaces isâbut speakâmy blood runs cold. Be quick, and name these dangers.â AZEMA. Mighty Empress, You know that at this hourâthe demi-god, At thought of whom I shudderâdoth expect A secret sacrifice should be perform'd In yon dark labyrinth to Ninus sacred. And even now that impious wretch Assures Doth rend the holy cerements of the tomb, And dares to violate that sanctuary Never as yet by mortal foot profaned. SEMIRAMIS. How know'st thou this?âSay, wherefore should Assures Thus dare t'insult my husband's sacred ashes, And brave th'infernal Powers? AZEMA. âFor a vile one. Eternal night reigns in these dreadful caverns, Hid in the friendly covert of whose darkness, He means to raise his sacrilegious hand Against the sacred life of his new monarch. SEMIRAMIS. What spectre, or what god reveal'd this deed? AZEMA. Deep-searching love has probed his dark designs.â E'en now the monster's boldly marching on To sacrilege and murder.âThro' the city He's caused it to be rumour'd that Arzaces Is the devoted victimâin whose death Ninus will wash away his mighty wrongs. SEMIRAMIS. Thou hast no cause for fearâvirtue like thine The gods themselves protectâsure thou may'st trust A parent's care and fondness.âLov'd Azema, This instant both our fates shall be accomplish'd, Haste, pious maid, and supplicate great Jove To shield Arzacesâwhilst I fly to save Your husband and my son. AZEMA. O mighty pow'rs, What is't I hear!âIs then Arzaces Ninias? SEMIRAMIS. The gods themselves enlighten'd my dark soul When they beheld me plunging into crimes. Once more methinks they inspire a wretched mother, And in their endless mercy deign to shed Soft peace and new-born joy on my sad heart. They bid me fly to save a much-lov'd son, And free him from a dark assassin's toils. [Exit Semiramis. Manet AZEMA. What sudden cause thus animates the Queen? What are her great designs? why does her heart Thus heave and swell as it would burst her breast? This prodigy surpasses all my hopes. The prince is found! O blest, yet fearful tidings! My fond love whispers, that his anxious mother Will come too late to shield him from the traitor. O why, ye cruel gods, was he restor'd, Thus soon to tear him from my bleeding heart. [Exit Azema. SCENE THE THIRD, Changes to the Mausoleum, and the Queen re-enters, arm'd with a Sword. SEMIRAMIS. Shade of immortal Ninus! lo I come Prepar'd t'avenge thy manesâfor behold The fatal hour is now arriv'd, in which Thou did'st thyself declare it should be lawful For me to penetrate this dark abode. Still am I bound t'obey thee; and these hands, Which heretofore have held the reins of empire, At thy command are arm'd to aid thy son. O mighty Jove, Thou know'st the purity of my intents, 'Tis thine t'assist me in this hour of terror. [Enters the Mausoleum. SCENE THE FOURTH. Enter Ninias and Azema. AZEMA. Do I behold you once again in safety, And in these arms enfold the son of Ninus! My long-lost sovereign, and my destin'd spouse? NINIAS. Yes, my belov'd Azema, you embrace Your long betroth'd, your ever faithful prince. Yet know, this blood curdles within these veins. The dreadful mystery has been reveal'd; And lo! I tremble now to know myself. Dispel these horrors, that surround my soul! Strengthen my heart, and nerve this drooping arm, Bid it revenge a fatherâ AZEMA. Prince, take heed How you fulfil this dreadful oracle. NINIAS. From me the gods demand a sacrifice. I've sworn, and must obey. AZEMA. And canst thou think Ninus requires his son should prove the victim? NINIAS. I understand thee notâ AZEMA. Thou shalt not enter Into yon house of darknessâthere a traitor Ev'n at this instant spreads a deadly snare, And by a coward's plan means to destroy His unsuspecting prince. NINIAS. Shall I not enter? No pow'r on earth shall stay meânought deter me. AZEMA. [kneeling.] Thus humbly on my knees let me implore thee To hear and take my counselâbase Assures With sacrilegious steps doth violate Thy father's sacred tomb, and there ev'n now, Arm'd like a dark assassin, he awaits To lift his rebel arm against thy life! NINIAS. Great Gods, all is reveal'd! 'tis ye who've dragg'd Forth to the light these deeds of guilt and darkness! My fears are now remov'd, my victim's known. And hark! my father, by this monster poison'd, Now cries aloud, and doth demand his blood. Instructed by the priest, led on by Jove, By Ninus' self thus arm'dâwithin yon tomb Fearless I'll strike the blow, and yield to Fate. [Enters the tomb. SCENE THE FIFTH. AZEMA. May every guardian pow'r shield and protect him, And guide his steps in yon dark cave of death! Ye horrid caverns, ye whose dreadful wombs Brought forth dead Ninus! once again yawn wide, And be the victim murderous Assures. And thou, great Ninus, his too cruel sire, Thou who would'st not permit his weeping mother T'attend him in thy tombâwar on his side. But soft! methought I heard his well-known voice Mingled with dying groans. [It thunders. Hark! the loud thunder rolls, vindictive lightnings Inflame the heav'ns, and shake the guilty earth, Yet I'm not lost to hopeâSee where he comes! The conquerorâthe avenger! SCENE THE SIXTH. It thunders and lightens. NINIAS. Ye gods! where am I? AZEMA. Alas! my lord, horror sits on your brow, You're breathless, pale, and bloody. NINIAS. 'Tis the blood Of that vile parricide who slaughter'd Ninus. My father was my guide, his sacred shade Mark'd where I should perform this act of justice. Behind a pillar, one funeral lamp Darting its feeble ray, scarce yielded light Sufficient to behold the glittering sword Which base Assures brandish'd, whilst his arm Trembled thro' guiltâand I with tenfold rage Twice plung'd my vengeful steel deep in his breast. Still was revenge unsated; and my arm, Dyed in the assassin's blood, with fury dragg'd him Near to the entrance of the gloomy cavern. AZEMA. Say, wherefore have you left his impure corse Within those hallow'd walls? NINIAS. Belov'd Azema, I must confess the traitor's deep-fetch'd groans, Which seem'd at this last hour to rend his heart, Unstrung my nerves, forc'd me to quit my prey, And to abandon my still-bleeding victim. But say, Azema, wherefore is my soul, Tho' pure and undefil'd, yet chill'd with fear? Wherefore am I still destin'd to endure The pangs of keen remorse? AZEMA. Fear not, brave prince! The deed was pleasing to the godsâat length The demons of revenge are satisfied, And Ninus' restless spirit sleeps in peace. And, since the curst Assures is no moreâ [Assures appears at the further End of the Stage, with some of his Party. NINIAS. Just Gods! what do I see? that hateful traitor Living, and in my presence!â What act has then my erring hand perform'd? Now will I drag thee to my father's tomb, And there, as he commanded, will perform That sacrifice ordain'd by Jove himself. ASSURES. Know I despise thy threats, scoff at thy vengeance. My greatest torment I endure already, 'Tis to view thee my sovereign. [Exit Azema. [They fight, and Assures falls.] Yet, fond youth, I leave thee far more wretchedâsee yon tomb! Look and contemplate thy late glorious act! [Dies. [Semiramis appears wounded, leaning on a Priest, at the Entrance of the Tomb. NINIAS. O horror! horror! has my blinded rage Struck at my mother? Enter Oroes and Azema. OROES. Prince, haste to the temple, And at the altars purify those hands, Whilst you replace in mine that fatal blade Which Heav'n ordain'd its instrument of vengeance. NINIAS. Off!âlet me plunge it in my guilty breast! SEMIRAMIS. O much-lov'd son, haste to revenge my death; For in thy father's tomb I'm fall'n the prey To an assassin's sacrilegious hand! NINIAS. O hour of horror! O unheard-of crimes! That sacrilegious monster was thy son. But I will follow thee down to the tomb, And thou shalt die reveng'd.â SEMIRAMIS. Alas, my child! Into that house of darkness I descended To save thy precious life, thy wretched mother Went thither to defend and to assist thee; But O unerring justice! I've receiv'd From thy dear hands that death I've long deserv'd. NINIAS. This deed shall prove the last accursed act Of my loath'd lifeâI call the gods to witness, Those cruel gods who led me on to murderâ SEMIRAMIS. It is enoughâI pardon thee my death, If thy dear hands will deign to close my eyes. Come to these arms! I crave it in the name Of that same blood from which thou sprang'st, which now In purple tides flows from thy mother's heart. O my lov'd son, let us exchange forgiveness! Thy will conducted not thy cruel hand, And lo, I'm justly punish'd.âMy son!âAzema! Let your expiring mother join your hands. May ye live long, blest in each other's goodness; And may your reign be prosperous as 'tis just! Ah! now death hastens on, I feel him now Thro' all my sensesâO farewell, my son, My dearest son!âO mercy, mercy, Heav'n! It's pastâit's finish'dâOh! [She dies. NINIAS. Farewell much-lov'd, yet O too guilty mother! Let the remembrance of thy crimes, O Queen, Sleep with thee in the tomb, while thy great deeds Live in the bosom of thy mournful son. OROES. Such sad examples should instruct mankind, The higher they are plac'd in this bad world The stricter they are call'd to their account, The more severely punish'd.âO that all, then, Wou'd set due bounds to fierce o'erbearing passion, And seek the paths of never-erring virtue! Then should they meet a bright reward on earth, With peace, and joys ineffable hereafter. End of the Fifth Act.</field>
