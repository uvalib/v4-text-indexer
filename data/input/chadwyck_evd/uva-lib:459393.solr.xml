      <field name="fulltext">To his worthy to be much honoured Cousin Henry Burnell Esq. on this his Tragie-Comedy, &amp;c. Though my prayse cannot adde ought here: Yet, give Me leave (Cousin) to rayse my selfe, and live Past time with thee; for, what thou writ'st is fine, Pleasant, profound, chaste, morall, and divine; Beyond the childish flashes of this age, Affected non-sence, and Canarian rage; Or Garagantuan foppery. Not one word That's immateriall do'st thou affoord, Vaine, or superfluous. Thy phrase is good; Nay, strong, and elegant, though understood Not by light-headed ignorance that do's admire Strange language only. Wave, vote, flames, and fire, Tempests and whirlewinds, Scorpions, and Hags, Are stuffe that take such, though indeed but rags, Base rags that they patch on, and thou do'st scorne; Or any dialect that is much worne, Though by the best; thy words thou mak'st to fit (Not contrary) th' Conceptions of thy wit, And, though thou England never saw'st: Yet, this (Let others boast of their owne faculties, Or being Sonne to Iohnson) I dare say, That thou art farre more like to Ben: then they That lay clayme as heires to him, wrongfully: For he survives now only, but in thee And his owne lines; the rest degenerate. Nay, I can more affirme (and truly) that In some things thou do'st passe him: being more sweet, More modest, mylde, lesse tedious; Thy owne feet Goe thou on stoutly then: if thou proceed, Him (though 't be much) in all points thou'lt exceed. Io. Bermingham.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue delivered by an Amazon with a Battle-Axe in her hand. The best of English Poets for the Stage (Such was the envie, nicenesse, and the rage Of pettish weakelings, and detracting fooles, That could prayse no man; and, i'th' muddie pooles Of their owne vices, were o'rwhelm'd) was faine An armed Prologue to produce, on paine Of being tongue-strucke. There ore, marvell not The present author (having not forgot How in's first Play, he met with too much spite) Sho'd send an armed Amazon, t' invite (If it be possible) all minds to affect What of himselfe, he could not well expect From his detractors: Or, to let those know, He cares not each of them prove still a foe. Yet, this his second (as that first) he made To please you, not for Money; to invade Your wills for your owne profit. For, if his minde He had sought by it to content, you'd finde Another method in't; and not a word Of any mirth or love, wo'd he afford To make you laugh or languish. All, rich stuffe (Though not so pleasing) he'd expose, to cuffe (And generally too) the monster vice; Which he performes but gently, in this piece. Yet, it's beleev'd 't will please the most and best, In all the passages; and for the rest. Let 'em (if they will needs) in pudles swim: For, he sleights them more, then they can wrong him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first Act. Enter Fredericke and Wermond. Fred. It's a noble, noble act! Wer. And cannot. But vex the bloudy usurper, let him put Ever so good a face on't, though they were But women only, that conspire against him. Fred. It stirs him not: for since his conquest made On us, and murdring of our lawfull Prince, Things have succeeded so to all his wishes, That he's grow'n carelesse: nay blindly besotted By security, and selfe-perswasion, Lock'd by the tempest of his lust; so as He feares no force of man; much lesse weake women, As he is pleasd to tearme 'em; he minds nothing But whom to kill, or foulely ravish: and The conversation of his Bawds, and Spintries. Wer. Is't possible, he sho'd be so secure, And passe away in such a dying slumber? Fred. He thinkes the gods doe slumber too, or winke At what he do's, or rather snore supinely; Or that there are no gods, and what's spoke of 'em Is but a meere foolish fable; He'll beleeve No mans intelligence, not his owne spyes, That this fleet of Denmarke, now lanch'd forth, sho'd move Against him hither. Wer. It's not all the power, He for the present can command that will Resist it, if it doe; joyn'd to the valiant Landgartha, with her faire lock'd troope of Ladies: Musicke of Recorders. But, let's be silent; here the wretch himselfe comes. Enter Frollo leading a weeping Lady, Hasmond and Gotar. Fr. Come my pretty sweet-heart, dry up those pleasing Eyes; this liquor's too precious to be spilt In such a cause, for a lost Maydenhead, And to a King that will become thy slave for't, And for more of that sport: who to please thee In that, and whatsoever else thou canst conceive, To rayse content to thee, and varri'd to thought, Will ransacke Kingdomes. Lady, Leave me yet blacke Devill, Breakes from him Thy words found farre worse than the voyce of Hell. Fr. Some kicke the Spyder out at the Court gates; An angry scratching Cat. We wo'd not be Exeunt Fred. and Wer, with the Lady. So vex'd another night with such a foole. Got. She'll soone repent Sir, and turne backe, to offer Her dainty body to your mylder usage. Hasm. I rather thinke, she'll to the mad Langartha; And there make one among her furious troope Of Furies, that will yet endure no horsing, Though they manage bravely. Fr. There's a Wench indeed, What lucke had I, never to lay my hands On her? They say she's very faire and handsome. Hasm. The clappers of mens tongues proclayme that; and Speake strange things of her. Fr. We shall finde'em (the best Is of it) altogether, to make a royall Choyce. We meane to single forty at least, Of the most buxome (of which she shall be Chiefe generall, as now she is) for our Owne private pallat. Hasm. I may hope (Sir) you'll grant Me halfe the number, with her wise and modest Aunt Elsionar, to precede: Or her fine Valorous sister Scania, for I must Imitate your manly vertue, Sir, as neere As I can. Fr. Marke we'l what I say now: for thy Good service as my honest smocke Atturney (Though sometime, yet thou did'st begin to us, thou'lt say For feare they'd beene diseas'd:) thou shalt not have One woman (wert thou e'er so willing) more Or lesse than thirty. Hasm. O Prodigious! Ieeringly. I doe beseech you, Sir, to heare me speake, Like so many Basilisks (with angry shots From their sharpe venom'd eyes) they'd strike me dead: Or (as the Porcupyne) send fether'd arrowes At me, for my slacknesse. Fr. You must have thirty, Or none. Hasm. Nay, If I must, I shall: and that's As bad. Got. You will not (Sir) be altogether Solemnely. Unmindefull of my good endeavours. Fr. By no meanes, good Sir, thou shalt possesse for thy Share, twenty five; with the pretty smugge Fatyma, To leade'em. Gotar. I humbly thanke your grace, though I Sho'd not covet so many desperate femals: Yet, with the assistance of my kindest friends, I shall be strongly back'd. Enter Wermond. Wermond. May it please you, Sir, Here are arriv'd two posts at once, all full Of sweat and durt; and bring bad newes, it's fear'd. Fr. Curse on thy feares, Goe, send 'em hither to us; Exit. It's but these women that affright fooles thus. Enter first post. What newes? be briefe. Gotar. He's full of durt, indeed! 1. Post. Landgartha with a mighty troope of women, Gatherd to her from all the parts of Norway, Make havocke of your souldiers, sir; and killing All the Sweds they light vpon, they likewise threaten, They will grant you (ere long) no better quarter. Fr. My Sweds and I will make some, here in Norway, Pay dearely for that vant. Come, doe thou croake too Enter 2. post. The worst tale thou canst. 2. Post. You had neede, Sir, make quicke Resistance, or shift for your selfe: for, the King Of Denmarke, with a mighty fleete, has now Put in at Mastrand; and begins to land His forces, to joyne with Landgartha's: who With maine speede, marches to meete him thither. Fr. Which he shall soone repent, and so shall that Male-harted Traytresse, withall the curll'd knot Of rebels that attend her; We are not So unprovided, as they doe suppose yet, Fly therefore Hasmomd, gather thou our troopes Within and neere the Citie. Gotar, thou Haste to the quarters further of; and with All possible speed draw unto us. Away When need compels, men must use no delay. Exeunt omnes: A march, then enter Landgartha, Scania, Elsinora, Fatyma, and one or two Ladies more, all attyr'd like Amazons, with Battle-axes in their hands, and Swords on. Land. We now (sweet Ladies and deare sisters) march not Against th' intemperate Frollo: but ascend The milkie way, that leads to immortall fame, Not to be rank'd among the starre-made harlots: But stated in the high'st Empyreall heaven, To side the gods, where Pallas and chast PhÅbe (Arm'd chiefely with the weapons of their vertues) Keepe all the Masculin deities in awe. This our designe may well exalt us thither, As their good deeds did them: that in defence Of that all sho'd hold dearest, our honours, Ladies, Doe now expose our selves to death, and what A cruell, vicious, revengefull Tyrant May inflict on us, if vanquish'd. Yet, this act Of ours we must not vainely boast of: for, The little birds will (with their beaks and wings) Offend the ravishers of their young issue. What then should we performe thinke you, that farre Passe these? yeild up your bodies basely to Foule rape and lust, and so to infamie For ever? No, no: farre be this from us Honour'd virgins, that have such armes to wield These cutting weapons, being (too) to fight authoriz'd, By the examples of the noblest women, Semiramis, Zenobia, faire Cinana Sister unto great Macedon, stout Alvilda, Cumilla, and the Amazonian Queenes, Great Mithridates Queene, and severall others, Are patterns now for us to imitate; O most brave patterns! Yet this we may say, That our chast glories shall passe theirs, as farre As th' worth of our intentions doth exceed The cause they undertooke: nor ought you doubt it. Let then the King of Denmarke fight where he lift: We will pursue no other than our worst And strongest adversary in's owne squadron; Where I, as first, will loose my life, or give A suddaine end to his blacke purposes, That sought a conquest on our chastities. Elsinor. Thy vertues and example, Neece: that are not To be reach'd by any imitation (At least of our endeavours) doe farre more Excite our courages, then Hermes could, Were he now here, to play the Orator: Lead on then; you shall find us no bad seconds. Scania. I have more than a womans longing to begin. Land. I know Fatyma, though she be not great, Has not the least desire to fight among us. Fatyma. Stay till you see me knocke some great ones downe; Untill when, I shall well remit your prayses. Land. Then follow me; and as you see me wooe The Swedish King, to his doe you so too. Exeunt. A march. Enter Reyner, Valdemar, Inguar, Hubba, and one or two or more Souldiers with Axes. Reyner. It's my chiefe comfort, noble Cymbrians, Subjects and friends, to be your guide to day, Against a valiant, wicked adversary; And for our right, th' inheritance of this kingdome, To shew that vertue and the cause, doe more Prevayle than any humane fortitude, Or setl'd Councels, when they're joyn'd to vice; And by injustice leeke to advance their state: Which wisely our forefathers mask'd beneath The fables of the Titans 'gainst the gods. But it sho'd seeme the vertue of our foes (Wisedome and valour) has forsooke 'em, by Their palliardise, by ease, and hourely ryot; This kingdome being more fatall unto them, Then Capua was to Hannibal: and therefore, Not worth your meanest feares: I must not then Inlarge my selfe in words too farre, because You need 'em not; nor need you be beholding, Unto the fames of your brave Ancestors, Those valiant Cymbrians, that almost gave An end to Rome, the Mistris of the world, And not in her declyning dayes, when her Owne vices had confounded her; as when The Gothes and Vandals (now our enemies) Did trample on her, being downe before. She liv'd full man, when great King Beleus Did (on the borders of rich Jtaly) Vanquish three of her bravest Generals, Sylanus, CÅpio, and Manilius. This (if you please) you may consider; and That our foes are more famous for their whoredomes, Than conquering of Norway. Reflect also How for this cause, we are assisted by An Angel troope, of chast and noble Ladies: Whom neyther losse of life, or other evils Can fright, from seeking to revenge the wrongs Done to their Sex, their parents, and their friends. Then, let's not shame our selves now in their presence, Or to posteritie: by being out-gone By women in a battle. Lastly, consider The everlasting honour due to vertue; Of which we now shall make a glorious purchase. Hub. I am affraid you will consider (sir,) So long of these women; untill you forget What you applaud so feelingly, your vertue. Rey. Thou'rt alwayes merry, Hubba, honest withall; And from my heart I wish, that each man here Performe a Souldiers parts, no worse than thou; We shall not then be beaten. Vald. Let's march on, sir: And you shall quickly find the meanest of 'em, Valiant and strong to purchase what's your birth-right. Rey. Then let us move; and prosper too, as we Affect injustice, or impietie. Exeunt. A march Enter Frollo, Hasmond, Gotar, and two or three more with Axes. Frollo. We must not loose our confidence, brave Warriors, Though we be taken somewhat tardy, by A sort of raw fresh-water souldiers, weake Unmartiall women fitter for night encounters, And some poore fugitive Norwegian rebels, Conquer'd and beaten oft by us before. What then although our numbers be the lesse? Yet not by much: the glory of the adventure, Would not be worth the paines we under tooke else. Besides, if we consider what our Ancestors Have (by their never-equall'd vallors) oft Perform'd against the noblest nations of The world, this our designe is nothing: nothing To what they did: What we have done our selves, And meane to doe hereafter. Notwithstanding, Let me commend unto your memories, After a generall fashion (for now The time exacts deeds more than words) what some Of their large conquests were, not onely in Europe, Which was all theirs a'most: but in Affricke, a third and richest part of th' world; Which from the Ocean unto Nyle they won; And from the Mid-land Sea, to the torrid Zone. Great Rome her selfe (that wisedome boasted most, And next her vallor) was by our fathers taken, Pillag'd, and burnt foure times at least; and her Large Empyre brought to nothing. She master'd all: We master'd her; And will not now degenerate first of ours. What though men say, we are not religious? Religion is but a toy, and first invented By politicke States, to keepe fooles in awe; And of all men observed least by themselves, If she but thwart the least of their intendments. They glorifie her much for their owne ends; And that's even almost all: and so may we. Yet, honour by warre, riches, and our pleasure, Shall be the Altars, and the gods we'll bow to In our free mindes; and what we gaine we'l keepe. King Reyner therefore was not wise, in seeking To dispossesse the bravest Nation breathing, Of what they have atchiev'd by the right of conquest; And shall (I hope) in snatching at our Crowne, By your more pow'rfull armes, soone misse his own. Ex. Allarums. A good while after the allarums are begun, Enter Frolle and a gentleman. Frol. Furies and plagues: these wild, wild bloudy whores, Fight like so many Tygers: without the least Apprehension of feare, or any kind Of mercy: the pursie Danes come nothing neere 'em. Having cut off our vauntgard, and right wing, They presse on our maine battle too; and force It to give ground. Goe, fly thou: and charge Hasmond To fetch the reare with speed up; that we may Exit gentl. (There being no other hope for safety left us) Upon one desperat onslaught hazard all. Enter Scania. Scan. I am glad I've met you, sir. Frol. A pretty fine peece, aside. I wo'd faine save this. I sho'd preferre Thy beautie, unto ought that's ours; prove kind And gentle unto thee, sweet-heart: if thou'lt But yeeldâ Scania. To thy imbraces, that must 'a' had My sister, me and forty more. We now Shall see what your can doe 'gainst one: Come quickly Then, vnto your guard sir: or I shall soone send forth Your too hot bloud, to coole your lustfull heart. Frol. Plague on you for a company of spitefull, Venomous tong'd bitches. Ye had rather lye With the worst Hynde of your owne, than the best of us. Scan. Villaine, I'll answer thee another way. Offers to fight on which Land enters. Land. Hold sister. This must only be my mate: Goe, seeke you out another somewhere else? Exit Scania. Frol. Art thou Landgartha? or some supernall goddesse, Descended in her fairer shape, to make A conquest now on Frollo, that must yeeld Himselfe thy captive? Land. Thou once call'dst me subject; And I am come to tender my alleageance, To your ungracious wickednesse, thusâ stricks at him. Frol. Hold, for heavens sake hold, and patiently But take my faithfull vow. Doe thou withdraw Thy troopes from our defeat: and by the Olympian Gods, I shall no sooner Have strucke King Reyner with his punic Danes, But I'll make thee my Queene. Land. Thy Concubyne. Frol. All miseries light on me then for ever; Or if I ever mixe with woman but Thy selfe: for thou art worthy of a Mars, A Hercules, or Iupiter. Land. And have Fully resolv'd never to kisse any man, But him that shall first master me in fight: You are best therefore looke well to your selfe, sir; Or I shall quickly marry your hearts bloud To this weapon. They fight &amp; he's hurt. Frol. I bleed you see: let which Serve as an offering, to appease thy wrath Conceiv'd against a wretch, that now repents Here Rey. Vald. Inguar &amp; Hubb. are discovered. (Unfainedly) his former evill life. May the gods chiefe attribute then (mercy) Find roome for me (a Convertite) in thy Noble and vertuous soule: and I shall still Become thy pious imitator: be Govern'd by thee in all things, and thy husband, By heaven and all, I will Land. But I hope you shall not: For I must try your manhood once againe. They fight, and she strikes him downe. Reyn. O brave mayde! Frol. Faire Furie, thou hast kill'd me, Hell take thee for 't: my love is now cool'd indeed. But I will be reveng'd. I cannot, cannot rise: The losse of bloud, and paine, strike faint my pow'rs: That I were now on high transform'd Atlas: This being no fable, but a truth: that I Might cut the axle-tree of heaven in two: And tumble downe the gods, and breake their necks, Proud gods, if such there be. Then, like Enceladus (Loaden with flaming Etna) I sho'd turne, And shake out all the starres: The sunne, and with That fire, burne all to cinders. Thus I 'd turne: O divels, I cannot: but doe feele a pitchy Cloud (darker than night) hang o'r my drowsie temples: And must (there is no remedy) descend, to stalke Along th' infernall waves, or wasted over, Grapple with the damned Furies, receive my soule You beastly Hags, then: that shall torment you more, Than you can any. Dyes. Land. The gods are now reveng'd On thee, by me, libidinous Woolfe, foule Tyrant. Rey. And rid me (worthy Lady,) of a dangerous Adversary. Land. I doe beseech, sir: Kneels on one knee. As my duty onely to receive that, Vnto them and your grace, though a woman. Rey. This to me (Madame) is too great an honour. Pray stand up. I should rather kneele to you, Whose beauty and incomparable vertues, Exact no slender adoration, From all those that love goodnesse; or the image Of heaven in your face. We must acknowledge, Notwithstanding our right to the crowne of Norway, What pow'r soe'r we have in't, gain'd and confirm'd Chiefly by you, that are our strongest friend. Land. Your poore and humble vassall, that desires No other recompence for her small service, Than your Kingly licence, to remaine (When your foes are wholly vanquish'd) from all Imployment sever'd: to leade a solitary Quiet life, being compell'd (in the defence Of what I ever most esteemed) to match Thus amongst men; which I did not covet, but The contrary. Rey. You will not wrong the world (The race of man, sweet Lady,) so to robb it Of such lustre: nay of all light, by Dedicating of what is onely good in't, Your selfe, to solitude. Land. I must not be Compell'd to any state of life, sir. Rey. You cannot Madame, I see that; and (by your force my foes Now put to flight) I shall continue alwayes, Not onely a meere servant, but for ever Your bondman; not to offend you i'th' least thought. Enter Scania, Elsinora, &amp; Fat. Vald. Here be other noble friends (sir) to whom you Stand bound in no small summes. Elsinor. Of Princely favour Onely. Rey. Rise faire Ladies, you shall command Vs, being your creature. Hub. they're delicate fine wenches, pretty youths. Land. You are now, sir To consider, how to use your victory. Scania. For us, we shall hereafter (we doubt not) Partake the fruits of your most Royall bounty, Which we shall begge more, for the generall Good, than our particular interests, sir. Rey. You shall be the Law-makers, to your selves: For those, by whom we raigne, shall be our guides: In the meane time, thou Valdemar and Inguar, Pursue the flying foe, but most with mercie, Not of circumspection, yet, least th' Van Turne by some accident, by us not thought on; Save all that yeeld, whom we doe meane to send Home ransomelesse; to see if that benefit May worke a peace betwixt us, If it doe not, We shall the next time be the more excus'd, In our extending of severitie Come Ladies, we'll to counsell to conclude Concerning what we have (by you) subdu'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The second Act. Enter Valdemar, and Jnguar. Vald. It's a strange humor that has seaz'd upon him; whatsoever the cause be. Inguar. When you are Ignorant of it, all others must be so. Vald. He discovers nothing to me save onely That he is full (and that he often sayes) Of griefe and heavinesse; and sometimes sicke. Ing. His sicknesse may (in time) prove dangerous, If some fit remedy be not apply'd. Uald. He'll heare of none; I urg'd his Physitians, At which he storm'd, and bad me leave him to Himselfe; and since I dare not come in sight. Ingar. It's a deadly malady, that will admit Of no cure We are best put Captaine Hubba, Or the wise Cowsell on him: for the wit Of the one and th' others folly may remove More of that griefe he speaks on, than good counsell. Enter Rey. Vald. Here comes the man himselfe, in his usuall Meditation: and therefore let's away. Exeunt ambo. Reyn. She is divinely faire, and in her mind The noblest vertues keepe their residence, As in their loveli'st habitation, Being all in love with her, I thinke, as I am, From my sad heart warme teares (teares of affliction) The fire of my affection doth send up Into my eyes, that thence distill in streames, Which yet to me, are torrents of sweet joyes, Ioyes, that this is for her, my griefe proceeds From a profound feare I shall never gaine her, Injoy that unpeer'd modell of perfection. There is no way but one to pull the fruit Jove would turne Goose, to taste: she's so reserv'd To the least vicious acts; Wretch, that hope Is not (yet) left thee: For, being nobly borne (Though she no fit match be for us, in lieu Of worldly substance, being in her selfe An ample dowry for a richer Prince) We sho'd (and gladly) sue to be her husband. But a report goes, she will joyne with no man, In such an obligation, which (that she Will not at all have me) is that which striks A blacke despaire into my soule, and will (Vnlesse I meete some comfort) quickly kill me; Being sicke in body, as in mind already. Enter Hub. &amp; Cowsell. Hub. See, where he stalks. Doe you but put him out Of his sad humor; and thou sha't haveâ Cow. O Captaine, I am affraid, for he looks sowre upon't. Hub. No matter: feare you nothing, but proceed; And care not what you say, so you say something; It's your fooles fashion, and you now must seeme one. Cow. But hearke, you, Captaine. How sho'd I begin? Hub. Say that you come from the Ladies: so I leave you. Exit Rey. Sirra, what make you here? Hub. &amp; peeps. Cow. Come from the Ladies. Rey. Well sayd, speake that againe. Cow. Come from the Ladies. Rey. Very good, and what of them? Cow. Come from the Ladies. Rey. What, againe. Pray tell me, what did occasion Your so kind friendly visit to the Ladies? Cow. I went thither (being some two myle of) To be joviall with a new acquaintance Of mine, my brother Radger. Rey. Some such wise man, As thou art. Cow. He's a very honest man. Rey. And takes his cup soundly, I warrant. Cowsell. So. Doe many honest men beside him; and Keepe wenches too, that's more. Rey. And yet are honest. Cow. 's honest and faire-condition'd gentlemen, As live, I know severall of 'em, my selfe. Rey. The Ladies are well. How did they use thee? tell. Cow. They're all exceeding well: and us'd me kindly For your sake; gave me a banquet, strawberries And creame; we drunke helter-skelter too; the Ladies Tooke your health themselves, and ask'd me how you did; Landgartha sayd, you were a good man; and that She lov'd you with all her heart. Rey. Let me imbrace Jmbraces him. Thee from my heart, for that good newes, Hub. Sweet King, Have I found your malady? Cow. O kind Prince! Aside. Rey. What sayest? are they not delicate fine creatures? Cow. Indifferent handsome, passable, and so forthâ Hub. You 'll with a knocke be sent forth, I see that. Rey. I was not from thy want of wit, to expect Any true censure. But yet, tell me truely: Which of 'em all dost thou thinke is the fairest? Cow. The Lady Elsinora in my opinion, Is th' rich Pearle amongst 'em; Landgartha to her. Is but a meere milkemayde. Rey. He makes me sicke, A dunce to wrong the worlds chiefe ornament. Kicks, &amp; beats him. Cow. Oh, oh my bum! my bum! Exit, and enter Hubba. Hub. I perceive I must Venture a beating too. Rey. Thou mett'st a foole Going out that way. Hub. And he complaines of something Vnder favour. Rey. We gave some cause for't, but Doe now repent it. Prethee Hubba call him; He sayd some at of the Ladies. Hub. I can tell You more of 'em than he: for, I was lately too Where they (like a companie of fine ducklings) Wag together. Rey. Thy words are base. Hub. What wo'd You have me say? they are all very valiant, And made King Frolla pay for seeking (and But in's goodwill) to domineere a little Over 'em: he left his life and kingdomes by't. Rey. We therefore ought the better to love them. Hub. As your subjects onely, sir, but not to cast Vnder you on a bed, couch, or cleane mat: You know what fine Furies they are, if you vex 'em. Rey. We are not so unwise, as to consult Of their dishonour. Hub. Nor so farre (I hope) Mistaken to marry any of 'em. Rey. Why Hubba? are they not faire and vertuous, Think'st thou? Hub. I doe admire, sir, you sho'd valke So much of vertue: a thing th' arrantest Asse Will scorne, if Money be not joyn'd to it: And then (although he hate it, and the possessor Of it) he will prayse 't. Rey. Thou 'rt now in thy old humors. Hub. Besides, you thinke Landgartha faire: but I say, Th' Emperors daughter's worth a thousand of her. Rey. I 'de loathly beat thee Hubba: yet, I tell thee; Were Charlemaine (the Emperors father) now Alive, and in his Pryme of youth and glory. Landgartha (being his Paralell in vallor? By vertue much more) were a wife enough good For him; were she not neere so faire as she is. But all, all being joyn'd Hubba; I suppose He wo'd esteeme her his chiefe earthly blessing. I, I, and more, a Paradise on earth. Hub. Were she ten times better: you cannot have her. Rey. Thou shoot'st a suddaine feare (colder then death) Into me; You were best give no bad reason, For what you say. Hub. She has vow'd Chastity, Unto the gods: which bond though you sho'd be Content to forfeyt, it is sure she will not. Rey. The strongest poyson could not fincke me deader. Then thy sad tongue has. Exit. Hub. Flunge away in a rage: Well; I was to blame to tell him, what I was not Sure on: For now I truely doe conceive There is no plaster but one, that can cure him; And that the faire Landgartha must apply too; No garden hearbs will doe it, any one That has as much braine as a Wood-cocke, may now Finde that, that knowes what his disease is. He's worse Then horne-mad already; I 'll therefore after him, And what betwixt lyes and true tales, I shall goe very neere To fetch him to himselfe, and hope againe. Exit. Enter Inguar in the middle. The King stretch'd on his Couch, strangely distemper'd, And most unlike himselfe (his courage lost) He pules and whynes most pitifully: Good heaven, What strange disease sho'd render so devicted Such a man? So valiant? So each way noble? We see no outward cause, that sho'd distract him; Sho'd it be love? Enter Vald. to Inguar. Vald. Lord Inguar, I have newes For you. Ing. I long to heare 'em: For your count'nance (Showing alacrity) speaks comfort to the King. Vald. Did you never heare of a little blind Boy, that wounded many a proper man? Ing. Has Cupid shot his Highnesse? Vald. No mortall man, Nor god so deepe, 't will be proclaym'd in open Market shortly. Inguar. Who should the object be? Vald. Who but Volsci de gente Camilla? Th' fairest and best of women, brave, Landgartha Hubba is sent (on paine of his best joynt) To fetch her hither: from whence ere she part, Her duty and th' Kings gracious affection Consider'd, she may be glad to yeeld to his Commands; as I hope her sister will, to my Intreaties to serve her. Inguar. I beleeve, you 'ill finde Your selfe mistaken in those vertuous Ladies. Enter the foure Ladies in womans apparell with Swords on, and Hubba. Land. The gods defend so good, and mercifull A Prince; I know it's but a cold that troubles His grace. Hub. Not so (Madame) I can assure you; His disease proceeds rather of heate. He burnes Extreamely; and its thought by some, that his Physitians cannot cure him. Land. I hope They are deceiv'd that thinke so. Vald. Welcome to Court, Faire Ladies; Which, till now (that you lighten it With the divine splendor of your beauties) Was darker than a dungeon: and but a Hell Compar'd unto the Paradise of the Campe, Where in the fruition of your pleasing it Conversations, being rapt beyond our selves With hope of future favours, we in you Plac'd the whole summe of our felicities. Land. You are merrily dispos'itd seemes, sir, Which (to be plaine) becomes you but most foulely; The King being sicke, when all (and chiefly you) Sho'd (and not for ceremony onely) put. A darke face of sorrow on; and contayne Their slippery tongues, from talking over-idlely; Some may conceive your mirth proceeds, from being Next heire to him in bloud. Vald. It rather springs (Sweet Lady) from your comming now to cure him. Land. Which, with a joyfull heart, I sho'd performe If I knew how: Pray you therefore, kind sir, Be somewhat cleerer in what you conceive. Vald. 'ts quickly learnt; nature will teach you Madame, His grace will shew you too; you will not prove Ieeringly. Perverse. Land. Are you so blinde a Goate, to forget Gives him a box, on which all draw, and Scania steps in. Frollo so soone? to open your eyes take that. Scan. Pray sister hold, What doe you meane to quarell On a surmise? I know the Lord Valdemars Intents are noble, and much more the Kings. Elsin. Y'are to blame, Neece, to be so suddaine in such A fond conceit. Land. Doe we come to be abus'd? I 'll backe agen. For your part sir, you shall Exit, and the other three follow her. Not fayle to meete me, when and where you list. Hub. His grace will now run mad indeed. Vald. Lord Inguar, As you love me, follow that severe Lady; And reduce her (if ever you did ought for A friend) to mildnesse, and this way backe; or I Am lost for ever to the King and people: Exit Inguar. Captaine, goe thou too once more, for my sake. Hub. And as you meane to doe, forsweare my selfe That you meant no hurt. I have already told her A hundred lyes at least; and am now o' th' faith, That double the number will scarce serve to quiet her; It's such another untoward piece of flesh Exit Hub. Ieeringly. Vald. She is an excellent Mistris, and has taught Me such a Lesson, I have cause to thanke her: For she has given me patience, and wisedome; Honesty too I thinke. The flat truth is She has wrought strangely with me, very strangely, The ravishing notes of a Cycilian Cyren, Could not so have taken my Eare (and from thence My heart) with a most alluring kinde of Delight, as the smart-touch of her white hand has: It strucke into me such a love, To her Sister I meane, that came so kindly Betwixt us, as I doe now account my selfe, A gainer by the blow; in hope to gaine What I now love so much, and nobly too. Well, they will come backe this way againe, I know; And I must sing a very dolefull ditty, A Palinode; or pray, where they may see me, Being a thing I 've onely done but twice These seven yeares: once, that I went to sea: Secondly and lastly, before the last battle. Exit. Reyner is discover'd on a Couch, and a gentleman with him. Rey. Are th' Ladies come yet to Court? Gent. They are sir, And will soone be here. Enter Inguar &amp; Hubba. Rey. Whose that? Gent. My Lord Inguar. Rey. Where have you left the Ladies? Ing. Comming after (Sir,) Sad and much troubl'd for your want of health. Enter the 4. Ladies. Scan. You 'll be extreamely hated, if you use So much exception, on so little cause. Land. If he accost me any more, with his Base jeering countenance, and whorish language; My sword shall (for such kindnesse) kisse his middriffe. Fat. Pray pacifie your minde, you need not stand At so much distance. Rey. Are not they come yet? Hub. They now are here, by much adoe. Rey. Good Inguar, Intreat 'em to approach. Inguar. Madame, the King Desires you wo'd be pleas'd to draw neerer. Rey. You honour me, sweet Ladies, in this visit: Which, beyond expression adds comfort Vnto a wretched sickely man. Chayres there, Pray you sit downe; y' are all exceeding welcome. Land. Our duty charg'd us (sir,) to obey your summons; Yet, our affection to your grac's welfare, And to that depends of it (the generall good Of the republicke) were the chiefe motives To our journey. Scan. And being able (sir,) to stead you In loving wishes onely, we must expect (With griefe to see his weaknesse, whose good health We most desire) your highnesse royall pleasure. Rey. Thankes worthy Ladies. We must also pay You in good wishes; being otherwise Too indigent to cancell what we are Ingag'd to you for many wayes. We have beene still opprest since your departure From us (whose vertuous presence, was all The comfort we had) with a heavy sadnesse, Nourish'd by griefe; nor doe we ever hope To see the Sunne againe, but at a window. Land. The gods defend you (sir,) from giving way To such despayre. Enter Vald. Vald. I follow after (like A Theefe) aloofe, to see what good successe The King has in his love suite; and to venter For my particular, as he makes his voyage. Scan. Your Majestie must never entertayne Darke melancholy thoughts, but quite cashire 'em. Vald. Her voyce founds sweeter, then the celestiall spheres, In their harmonious motion. I am more Then ravish'd when I heare it; and thinke I shall Fall sicke too, or runne franticke, ere 't belong. Fat. I heard no meane Physitian often say, Sir, That Musicke and mirth were good for sickely men. Rey. Bid the Boy sing the Song we made of Love. [Boy.] Song. Love's farre more pow'rfull than a King, And wiser then must Statesmen are: For it commands him, and doth spring In them strange thoughts; in both much care (Beside th' affaires o' th' Common-wealth) To crouch and to obey. Nay more It makes 'em loose all joy and health, And not be the men they were before; Vntill wise love, all pow'rfull love, The gracious Physitian prove. Land. This is a very loving song, Your grace made: but the contents of it, not To be apply'd to you sir, that may command (If pow'r and person can compell) the best And fairest Lady i' th' world to be yours, In a noble way; and otherwise your vertue forbids it. Rey. It does indeed forbid us what is vicious. And seeing we doe not hope for life, we must Crave your kinde pardon now, to heare us tell Th' occasion of our sicknesse, briefly thus: You are the onely cause on't. Land. How? I my liege? My knowledge sayes not so. Rey. Your beautie, vallor, And all the perfections (parted to others, But) in you conjoyn'd, protest it: and I For one can sweare it. But, being spell'd By a severely-awing rigor from your brow (Yet sweet withall, though killing) and being told Of a sad purposely have, never to marry; We now are fall'n thus low, beneath the Genter Of deepe despaire and sorrow: and desire, You will say something, eyther to hasten our deed, Or to recall it by a loving sentence. Land. I must take some time then to deliberate Aside. Rey. Being yours, in that you may command us. She goes aside &amp; the Ladies with her. Land. We expected no such entertaynment. Elsin. My minde foretold me still of some disaster. Scan. Notwithstanding your resolution, Not to marry: you have not vow'd against Obedience to a man, in that friendly Yoake of Wedlocke. The Kings sound affection Is not then to be rejected, if you ever Take any. Land. If I doe, he shall be the man. Fatyma. You must not study now long for some answer. Elsin. He's desperatly ill: and if you sho'd Give him a flat deniall, we might be All seazed on heere at Court, and some villanie Committed on us; being to defend our selves, Too few by many. Scan. They shall take our lives, Ere we'll endure to be defil'd. Fatyma. And with The losse of some of theirs. Rey. Have you consider'd Yet, of the doome y'are to pronounce? Elsinora. All stand Warily on their guard. Land. Your poore subjects (sir) Must rather expect (in duty) your commands. Rey. Nay sweet Lady. Doe not increase my torment, By adding affliction to misery, With a complement: but something say, that May appertaine to th' matter, to rid me Quickely of my paine. Land. It's sure; I have not (Although I ever meant it) bound my selfe, Unto a single life. Rey. Then dearest Lady, Consider who I am; and what I now am, Lodg'd thus: for though I clayme you not as by desert, Or dutie: Yet, being your Prince, you owe me Some regard; and all, I e'r must glory in, Shall be to make you Queene of what is ours. Land. May it please you, Sir. Rey. Pray you sit and speake: Or I must rise, if weakenesse will permit. She sits, and the rest stand. Land. Had I beene ambitious, when you were not Crown'd King of Norway: I could then perchance Have written Queene, unto your prejudice. But, for that Frollo once intended foulely, I (that could not affect vice) did refuse What he with earnestnesse, and many Oathes Sought to confirme; and was his bane at last, Though I beleev'd that what he said, he meant. Now therefore (Sir,) your affection (grounded In way of honour, without taint of basenesse; With such exterior signes too, of deepe love To me, unworthy of so great a Prince:) I cannot (nor will my heart permit it) but In way of gratefulnesse, reciprocally Requite with love againe, as dutie binds; Nay, more then so. But yet, gracious Sir, I (that am meane and poore to be your Consort; And that things of this kinde are oft repented) Doe now beseech you, to decline a while The vehemencie of your fleete desires; And take full time to thinke on what you doe: Were't but to take a neerer view of me, And that in all points. for know sir,the honour You now affoord me, compar'd to th' infamie That would redound to both of us, and to others (By whom you are to be advis'd) if ought Sho'd chance amisse, when things were consumate, Is nothing: would but heighten your disgrace. Your wise demurre too, I shall take as full payment For all my services; and rest devoted More deepely yours: and evermore continue Your loyall subject onely, sir. Rey. I was sure (Noblest and best of Ladies:) That your words (Being such as now they are) could not but worke A cure upon me. See, I can stand up: Nay, goe; I'll throw my Cap off too. Some of you Give me a Hat; I will walke with you forth Into the Gallery, and tell you there, I have consider'd so much what you are, Though not to your full value this being Impossible: that if you thinke me not Unworthy (as indeed I am for you) We shall soone be Man and Wife. To morrow I'll wayte on you further, into the Garden. Hub. And there (in one of the little bawdy houses) Aside, Seale the Covenant, if it be receiv'd; Though he were sure to die in an houre after. Elsin. I see she does affect him in good earnest. Aside. But wisedome bids be silent; This poore kingdome Being already torne too much, by tyrannie and troubles. Things past our helpe, with patience must be borne, Untill a fit time. Rey. Lady Elsinora, Me thinkes you doe not signe our loving motion, With a friendly countenance. Elsin. I hope, great Sir, You will be pleasd to entertayne farre better thoughts Of your humblest hand-mayd. Rey. I hope we shall. Land. In licensing our departure, for some small time (Dayes five or sixe, and for a private Cause:) You will for ever bind us (sir) to your commands; And to returne with all convenient speed, To obey your Highnesse pleasure in all points. Rey. That ask'd agen, would throw me on my Couch; Never to rise. Vald. Madame, I sho'd make bold To stop your journey, though the King were pleas'd To grant his licence: for you (I must say Somewhat roughly) saluted my left eare With your right hand, as these can witnesse for me. Land. For which, you are resolv'd to challenge me: But not to be your wife; I gave you no Such promise. Vald. I must have satisfaction. Land. You may declare what that is, when you list. Vald. Nay, you shall know it now; and thus it sounds: That you perswade this Lady, to become Takes Scan. by the hand. My second. For, love has strucke me too, so sore A cuffe (caus'd by her beautie, and what else Is good in her, in my opinion Superlatively:) that I shall ne'r be rid O' th' paine on't: unlesse you that are like to be My Cossen, advance me higher, to the honour To be your brother. We shall then be kind friends. Land. She is not my warde; and may take whom she fancies; I may my selfe repent, to be perswaded. Rey. Speake Ladie, doe you like the man? He is As good a Gentleman as We are: Say, Will you have him? Scan. You make me blush (sir,) to aske Me such a question. Vald. Nay then, it's granted. Scan. I will not grant at first; nor shall you say Hereafter I deceiv'd you. Fat. You deceive Your selfe. Well Madame, I perceive we two To Elsin. Must matelesse home to prove the Vestals. Ing. Not, sweet Lady, if you'll daigne to grace me, with The title husband. Fat. For your good will, sir, I thanke you: but will heare of no more coupling. Ing. I yet must love you still. Rey.

      <field name="fulltext">The third Act. Enter Fredericke and a Servant at the dore. Fred. Let 'em not presse so fast in, to behold A semi-maske: for now't can be no more, For want of fitting Actors here at Court; The Warre and want of Money, is the cause on't. Serv. Stand further off, my masters, or I shallâ Fred. Let fly amongst 'em. Vald. Pray you my Lord, have a care Enter Vald. and Lady. (For my sake) of this Lady; a kins-woman Of my wives. Fred. (I know you are Vxorious.) Land. He shall not need: for I will have a care Of my selfe. Fred. I sho'd gladly serve your Highnesse: But can hardly yet from hence. Vald. Come Cousin, I will be your Gentleman usher my selfe. Exeunt ambo. Cowsell within, make roome I say there, for me and my brother. Fred. What kinde Cossens are those? Serv. A payre of Coxcombes, So individuall by the littlenesse Of their understandings, they cannot be parted. Enter Cow. &amp; Rad. Cow. Come away brother Radgar, we'd need make haste, To take our places. Rad. I shall be proud brother, To be seated after you. Cow. And I fortunate To sit next before you. Rad. It shall be my ambition brother, to Be still (as now) your most humble servant. Cow. It must be all my study then, brother; To Command things onely pleasing: for marke you Deere brother. I must strive chiefly to precede, Butâin my affection. Fred. A pretty Antimasque: I will sit downe, and heare what it concludes. Rad. But hearke you now, brother. Shall we have any Drinke, Banquets, or soâ Cow. Not a drop betwixt meales, brother, That's but a simple Countrey fashion. Fred. Are they already fall'n from complement? Rad. Yet, me thinkes brother, 't were n't amisse to lay The pots hard by; and let him drinke that wo'd. Cow. I sho'd a part keepe with you, in that Catch brother, but now (with griefe enough) I say't (Wo'd I co'd not say't:) I cannot now (being puff'd Vp here for want of ayre) drinke nere as much, As when I liv'd abroad i' th' Countrie; nor eate The quarter quantitie. Rad. That must be beleev'd Generally, as a Maxime infallible: For to day brother, the stinke of your perfum'd And stuffing meates, tooke my stomacke quite away From me. Yet, we drunke pretty well you know. Cow. It's certaine (brother,) those that cannot eate, Must drinke, and I can drinke indifferent well still But, time there was I could 'a' payde it soundly. Rad. As, how much? Pray sweet brother. Cow. It is scarce Credible, I how shall tell you: at one short Sitting, I'd a drunke you of Wine fixe Flaggons, And two dozen of Beere at least, all at eight draughts; And never 'a' seene the colour of my face, In a Chamber pot; or sought ease, by visiting My kind friend Aiax. Rad. That's more by a little, Then I ever could vent the right way. But yet, I dare speake it brother, we are very neere As good drinkers, as you be here i' th' Citie: For you see, when we come to Towne, we doe Nothing but runne from Taverne, to Taverne; Oft to blind Ale-houses, to visit the fine Wenches, of purpose there plac'd, to draw custome; Now and then to see a Play, when we want Other exercise; and once a weeke (upon A holy day, when all doores are shut up) To a godly exhortation, and sleepe out (At least) three parts on't. Cow. Especially if you Take your liquor before hand. Rad. Right brother, but To morrow we will both from hence, to th' Countrey. Cow. Wo'd this night were over once. Rad. We've excellent Mayds with us, And while my Ladies dance and feast it here, Both night and day: We both will keepe Court there; Throw out the house at th' windowes, and fetch in All our Towne-fidlers, with all the young fellowes In fifteene villages about us; is 't not good? Cow. O rare! Fred. I' th' meane time Sir, let me perswade you To conduct your brother to a place: For I Am weary of your company. Cow, 'thanke your Lordship. Exeunt ambo. Hubba within, give way there. Fred. What lusty Gentleman's that? Serv. Mad Captaine Hubba, and as lusty a Virago with him. Enter Hubba and Marfisa in an Irish Gowne tuck'd up to mid-legge, with a broad basket-hilt Sword on, hanging in a great Belt, Broags on her feet, her hayre dishevell'd, and a payre of long neck'd big-rowll'd Spurs on her heels. Hub. Come my brave Marfisa, You are but just now come to Towne you say? Mar. That you may well perceive sir, by my spurs. Fr. Here's handsome Cheese and Butter, and a Sword. Hub. They're a payre of excellent ginglers, but pray Tell me: Did you ride sideling, or like a man? Mar. Howsoever, there shall ne'r a Dane ride i' my Saddle. Hub. What? not i' the way of honesty? as you love me, Say not so; I hope you'll be pleas'd to thinke of my service. Mar. I sho'd rejoyce to be well pleas'd i' th' way Of honesty: Yet, your faire words shall not Deceive me. As first try, then take on liking. Hub. But, with your favour I thinke 't were better try: Least you sho'd chance repent too late hereafter. Mar. You will not put me sir, to use my Sword: Puts hand to her sword. If you doe, you must first begin at that. Fr. I thinke she meanes to make him marry her Perforce; I shall have my part o' th' Maske here. Hub. Pray Lady, take patience along with you; I am fairely yours. Fr. You had (on my knowledge) But need to say so, if she be in earnest. Mar. Then leade me to some honest place, where I may Unspurre, untucke my Gowne, wash, and so forthâ Hub. Most willingly, my faire Marfisa, thou sha't Have a looking-glasse too; I ever tooke A strange liking to thee, since first I saw Thee fight i' th' battle like a Lyonesse. Y' are Coffen-german to th' Lady Fatyma? Mar. Her selfe dare not deny it, sir. Hub. I doe not Goes about her. Onely marke your sweet face, but all things else About you. Y' have a fine legge. The fashion Of this Gowne, likes me well too; I thinke you had The patterne on't from us, as we from Ireland. Mar. That I know not, but am sure a handsome woman Lookes as well in't, as in any dresse, or habit Whatsoever. Hub. So it seemes by thee, my Beautifull Mistris: For by that name, I must Stile you henceforth. Come, let your loving squire Conduct you. Mar, on before, I 'll follow. Exeunt ambo. Lowd Musicke. Enter Reyner, Landgartha, Valdemar, Scania, Elsinora, Inguar, and Fatyma. The Ladies attir'd like women onely. Rey. My Queene and I, Valdemar, are much bound To thy free Genius, for this thy second Maske After our nuptials; She more: but most Of all, thy owne Lady. For, it's for her sake Thou so affect'st both us. Scan. I could not wish To 'a' met a kinder man. Land. His kindnesse makes You oft asham'd, you say; nor wo'd I have The King so over fond of me. Vald. You stand Confirm'd, Madame, in the pow'r your merits Hold, to charme his faculties to your obeysance. Land. You deliver that, sir, to picke a thanke from My Sister; at whom you point in that language. Scan. I doe beleeve he does: which yet, must be Conceiv'd onely to proceed, from his ill-plac'd Affection; not my desert to answer His; much lesse your perfections: being But a poore Pigmie, compar'd to the greatnesse Of the worth in you. Rey. This friendly Complement Heere they take their places, but the King and the Queene under a Canopie. We will passe over: and now Valdemar, To apt our apprehensions the more To the true understanding of your Maske: You may tell us somewhat of your scope in't. Vald. That is sufficiently inform'd i' the thing It selfe; though lame it be. The matter (being All propheticall) I found in an old Worme-eaten Booke, in the Lady Elsinora's Library. And I sho'd wrong your judgements; And my owne labour, though of little value, By staling of it before hand. Fr. It's a fine tale; And cannot but please, unlesse it meet such minds, As are not to be pleas'd. Elsin. There is no Fustian, Non sense, Winde, or fopperie in't. Rey. It matters not What some odd envious foole sayes; that grieves most At th' goodnesse of what he disprayses: and wo'd Be glad 't were worse. We despise affected stuffe; Or astrayn'd kind of Eloquence; being the smoake And fruits of a vaineglorious, and an empty braine, No flattery dwels we know in this. Let it begin. The Maske. First enter six Satyrs and dance a short nimble anticke to no Musicke, or at most to a single Violine; at the end of which enter PhÅbus with Bow and Arrowes. PhÅb. Away unmanner'd deities, though hope Rayse you unto this mirth, for Troy: Your scope In't (form'd at the counsell of the higher gods) Makes not the issue of their Periods, So fortunate as you doe now suppose (In your inferior knowledges to dispose For Hectors safetie: whom Aracides (Madded for his lov'd Menetiades) Flyes to destroy. Nor can the Fates divert, But that fierce horrid man, will soone convert All unto sad destruction; unlesse We the pryme gods and demi-gods suppresse His force, not otherwise to be resisted. Get you away from hence then, and instead Of friskings, in these pleasant vales of Ide, Expose your aydes (to th' utmost can be try'd) For Pryam and his issue, ne'r till now In danger of an utter overthrow. Pal. Fine youth, ne'r shorne. Thou brandisher of darts, Exeunt Satyri, and enter Pallas with Helmet, Shield and Lance. That with thy Bow slew'st Python, thy best parts Thou now must urge against me 'n single fight: Till I have vanquish'd, or a shamefull flight Compell'd to thy swift feet; nor shall thy deere Beloved Hector scape my nobler Peere, Divine Achylles; for his lov'd friend slaine, Chiefly by thee. PhÅb. O let me not in vaine (Most chast and warlike Mayde) implore thee now For Hectors rescue that so manie a vow Payde me i' th' thighes of sacrifized Beeves, And not to me alone: For, my soule grieves To thinke of his losse. Nor do's it fit thee (As wholy bent upon impietie) To mixe unguilty with the guiltie bloud. Let it suffice, a vertuous Queene withstood (Penthesilea most renown'd) to her Lives losse, the Champion thou dost most preferre, With many other worthies: many more Of Pryams faire sonnes, slaine by him before. Which now let satisfie thy wrath; decline Thy further vengeance on the just, and thine Owne feast Companion, me: For, the blest gods Ought not to be (among themselves) at oddes. Exit. Pal. He's gone: but by his pow'r shall no way thwart, The Fates pronounc'd harsh-doome, shot at the heart Of his devoutest, and brave friend. Here comes Enter Achylles. PeleÃ¯des to strike the blow, that summes His happinesse, to obey my sterne Commands; And can doe more then all the Grecian bands. Enter Hector, whom Achylles encounters in a dumbe show by way of a Dance and (Pallas assisting) killes: then exeunt Pallas and Achylles. After which the Nymphs of Mount Ida sing this following Song in foure or five parts, to a pleasing Tune. [Nymphs] Song. Though Hector now be dead, his name And memory shall last, while fame Sounds her low'd Trumpet, lov'd, admir'd; By his example shall be fir'd To acts heroicke, future ages: And Prophets (sacred in their rages) Shall by his vertues be install'd; And he by all a worthy call'd. Hectors body is taken away about the middle of the Song: after the end of it, Enter PhÅbus and Pryam. PhÅb. Much honour'd and deere old man, did'st not heare, How the Jdalian deities forbeare Not (sacred loving Nymphs; and griev'd like thee) To chant a mirthfull pleasing melody? Glad for the future glory of thy sonne, Reason sho'd governe; and a faire fame wonne, Is of mans humane life the chiefest part, Chiefest in Hector, and shall not depart From thy for-ever-most-fam'd house: For, know Th' gods on thy line (of Dardunus) will bestow The largest Empyres; which to thee I'll now Show for thy comfort: that thou sho'dst not bow (Too much dejected in thy minde) to what They in their Counsels doe predestinat. Pry. Heavens brightest eye, I'll doe what lyes in me, To obey thy will, and my sowre destinie. PhÅb. My tale in two parts, I doe thus impart: A Prince from Troy hereafter shall depart, When Troy takes end (as all dominion Of mortals must:) whose chance will fetch him on The Lybian shores, and upon Latium next. Before which time and after though oft vex'd By the high-minded Juno, for her hates Conceiv'd against the Troians: Yet theFates Have destin'd him that throne of Latium, Marrying the daughter of its King. From him (The Royall seate first chang'd to Alba) shall Descend two Princes, twins; for which, a fall Their mother takes from Mars, a votresse she, Compell'd unto that state. Impietie In an ambitious kinsman, to be drown'd Sends both the Infants: who (sav'd by chance) are found Of a she-woolfe, and nourish'd with her Teats; Till by a sheepheard found, and by brave feats Made know'n to be themselves, they build a Towne Which shall be call'd Rome; and shall weare the Crowne Of the worlds Monarchy, hundreds of yeares. This is the first part of my tale. Pry. My feares And sorrow (which till now I did suppose Could not be done) th' hast heal'd. Disclose The other part (deare god) that's left untould. PhÅb. Which (in no obscure termes) I doe unfould: A Prince call'd Brutus (of the Troian race) Third to the first spoke of, being in the chace Of wild beasts, by unlucky fate he kils Sylvius his Father, with the shaft he drils At other game: Which fact, so much doth bend The Latines against Brutus, him they send To sad exile. Who (after a time) arrives At a brave spatious Iland (that derives Her name from white rocks, being a little world) With other Troians before met, and hurl'd Too on misfortunes. A towne call'd new Troy He builds here th' Land cals Brutaine: doth enjoy The whole as King; and his posteritie For many ages, shall raigne there, as he. Sometimes (in pow'r and plentie) conquering The neighbor Nations: sometimes these (for nothing But 's subject unto change on earth) afflict Againe Troy's Brutaines, in their owne district. Of which a certaine people, and call'd Danes (Cymbrians by some) will prove their worst of banes, But shall be beaten backe; not without paine. At length (in processe of much time) shall raigne In this faire Ile, a Prince (one way descended Of Troian race: I' th' other side extended Vp by the Royall bloud of Danes, unto A warlike King call'd Reyner, that shall wooe And wed a Lady Amazonian, Landgartha nam'd) which Prince shall be the man (Having his subjects in their loves combyn'd; Who shall to evils onely be confin'd By their owne sad dissentions, being of all Earths men, the properest and most martiall) To exalt thy bloud. He shall (by's right) enjoy The Land of Danes; and in this place where Troy Now stands, shall Conquer, and build it againe. Will also Conquer Greece, and there restrayne Th' impieties of wicked men. Thus, Fate I have layd ope' to thee, to consolate Thy selfe and sad Queene; Now I must away: For, from the gods I've made too long a stay. Exeunt ambo. Vald. Your Majesties have now seene all; even as I found recorded in the foresayd Booke: How true heaven onely knowes. Yet, all may prove true (Being not impossible) if men be wise. Rey. And not destroy themselves, as it's there spoke. Our part on't has hit right; and so may that. And now (Valdemar) to requite thy love, All rise. My Queene and I will make your Maske compleate, By being your dancers. Enter Hub. &amp; Marf. without her sword, &amp; her Gowne untuck'd. Hub. I must first beg your Pardon, to leade the measure, sir, for I have Brought a fine friendly dancer with me; and We will to foot itâ Rey. Hubba, thou alwayes comm'st in pudding time. Land. Let's stand, I long to see Marfisa dance. Here Hubba and Marfisa Dance the whip of Donboyne merrily. Rey. This was excellent. We shall but shame our selves, In following of you; Come let us begin. Here they dance the grand Dance in foure Couple, Reyner and Landgartha, Valdemar and Scania, Fredericke and Elsinora, Inguar and Fatyma. Rey. So Cousin, we have made you some amends, For your part of the Maske: and now you shall (Being so kinde a husband) conduct your Lady Unto her Chamber; and there use her kindly Too as she deserves. Our Aunt and Cousin may (After all this noyse) also retyre; and say (In solitude and silence) th' many prayers They have omitted all the day. As for The Queenes grace: she must give me leave, To usher her to bed. Land. Must That, in such A servant, were too peremptory. But If you plead your title King; I'll answer That I know how to fight: and have ere now Stoop'd a too hasty Prince. Therefore, good sir, You are best speake me faire; or I may put you Beside your sweet hopes; And give you somewhat of the sowre to taste. Rey. That, and to kill me, were all one: For which, I now (and ever will) humbly intreat, As a poore suppliant with you to treat. Exeunt omnes.</field>

Let him be quickly sent for then; be gone. Exit Hubba. A poore gentlewoman, an ordinary Noble mans daughter, to have catch'd me thus; Whom Cesar would rejoyce, to have made his sonne, Some horrid plague confound her modesty, And her for me, for now I care not for her; Though I dissemble it: because I dare not (She is so damn'd valiant) doe otherwise Till I have got from hence: For she (being So belov'd too of the Norwegians) might Cut short my life and passage. But yet, Reyner, Thinke how exceeding worthy she is of love; And of a Prince: thinke of her vertue, doe: Thinke of her beautie, myldnesse, vallor, and What else: no, no, I will not; will not love her: For I have tooke enough of what I most lov'd; Which, I confesse could not but please my Palat Enter Uald, But here comes Valdemar, who like an Asse Still dotes on his wife, I'll not therefore trust him. Vald. Your resolution to be gone for Denmarke, Men doe admire; and I must tell you, sir, (Seeing you will needs be constant, in so bad A purpose) some doe feare your projects are Ignoble. I then (as one that lov'd you once; And will doe still, unlesse you forfeyte your selfe) Wo'd be your adviser, if you dare take advice. Rey. Y' are too sawcie; and what I have resolv'd on, I will not alter. Must we be curb'd by you, In tendering the welfare of our subjects? Shall Denmarke be still forgotten? Vald. That colour Dyes but very poorely; though you stalke with it. The fall of your obstreperous passion, to Your Queene (sir) people take notice of: though she, Poore Lady, (a sham'd to be deceiv'd or scorn'd) Say nothing of it; restrayn'd too, by her love To you. But, we that are your Countriemen (Whom you mainely dishonour in't) can have No such patience. Rey. Or affection to our Lov'd faire Consort (though you be pleas'd to doubt it) Will not be question'd, but by your slanderous tongue. Uald. You cannot, sir. Nay shall not, maske your blacke Intentions so from me; they doe appeare Too many. And she whom you most wrong, is more Then worthy of you; had you but the wisedome And grace to thinke so still. But be assur'd (When she is rid o' th' burthen she now carries) She'll be reveng'd at full for her dishonour; And snatch the Crownes you weare from of your trech'rous Temples. Rey. You will not play the Traytor, in Conspiring with her? Vald. Though I sho'd not, sir, You need not doubt but Harrolld will; who thinkes His right to Denmarke, as good as yours to Norway. Rey. That Christian dog-shead and yours too, had beene chopt off ere this, had I not beene a foole. Vald. If you durst (you make me now beleeve) that had Beene so.

I beseech you sir, to suppresse your passion; And not to rayse a tumult here: knowing How truely-loyall the Prince Valdemar, Has ever beene to you, sir, and now pleads Strongly against himselfe; in seeking to Detaine you, with your gracious noble Queene. Vald. He accounts his friends, his neerest enemies, Rey. We take heaven to witnesse, we are wrong'd. Enter Land. with Childe and Scania not so. But peace; here she comes. Land. Will you needs be gone, sir, And leave me thus? Rey. It is but two houres sayling, In a faire day; and we shall soone be backe. Land. I doe not use to weepe: But now I must; Weeps.

I could not otherwise chuse, Mistris (though Your distrust of my unfayn'd affection, Kept me thus long from injoying, what I Most desir'd in a noble way) but come (Vrg'd by that love, that ever shall remaine With me, wheresoe'r I goe) to tender The duty of a servant, in taking leave Of you, before my suddaine departure. Mar. It's indeed too suddaine: and I doe now Repent the not imbracing, what I was not Enough good to accept, your love. For, I confesse Though somewhat late, I lov'd you more then you Did me; and ever shall unlesse the fault Be onely yours, in proving (which I doe Not yet suspect) a changling. I shall for My part, punish severely in my selfe, Th' offence of not being yours, by a continu'd Sadnesse and griefe, till once agen I see you. Hub. And though I have beene too much noted for My mirth (which yet, was never sawc'd with spite, Or other bad condition:) I promise (Por my misfortune in thus missing of you) Not to laugh once (unlesse against my will, At some unlucky chance) till I possesse The treasure I most covet. Mar. That (if you Meane me) shall be yours when we meete next, and Safely kept for you, untill then, I' th' meane time, I shall charily preserve (though but a poore Satisfaction for you) your image in Th' interior of my minde. Hub. Which overpay's, With much advantage, all my services. Mar. 't was a strange resolution of the King, To leave his Queene, she being so much against it; And he so strangely fond of her at first: Which she deserv'd, being a Lady the world Cannot match. Hub. He is these thirtie houres in Denmarke: Where if he prove unkinde to her, that cannot (In true judgement) condemne others, that like not Such proceeding. Mar. He had needed be circumspect In what he do's; or he may soone repent it, And perchance, When matters prove past remedy to him, Yet, while I find you sound: no alien faults Shall make me hate, what once I so affected. Hub. Resting on that assurance, I must now Crave the kind, favour of a parting kisse. Mar.

Enter Harold and Eric. Har. It's now but need, we both looke to our selves: Or we may pay the forfeyt of our slackenesse (With the losse of both our heads) upon a Scaffold. For, Reyner having cast the faire Landgartha Off, (of whom he was not worthy:) and by A dreadfull precipice, fall'n from much goodnesse: He will not stop at his first fault. But (hurri'd By the guiltinesse of his Conscience) Runne headlong downe the hill, upon the rocke Of dangerous mischiefe; to which he's now ingag'd. Eric. She is a Lady of so stout a heart, That when she finds him base (although she lov'd him Exceedingly) shee cannot but be reveng'd For her repudiation, and disgrace. Har. And may prove our strong friend to ruine him; That has threatned (and that not privatly) To rid himselfe on us. Eric. And will, if he can: You may by his death then, that wo'd be yours, Settle your selfe securely in his kingdomes, By matching and partaking now with her. Har. Brother, the man whose deitie we adore (And who to give us rest, still liv'd without it) Can witnesse for me, could I but perswade My minde by any probabilitie, 't were possible, for me to live in peace here, And not have my throat cut: although my right Unto the Crowne of Denmarke be apparant, My title while I slept or wak d, sho'd sleepe; As when King Reyner liv'd a vertuous kind man. For I delight not in th' expence of bloud; Though I feare not to spend my owne in a Iust cause. But seeing all rest is deni'd me: As the strong law of nature binds, I must Shift for my selfe, the best I may. Which shall not Be effected by base trechery, or murder. Nor doe I chiefly yet meane to rely On th' brave Landgartha's assistance; whom the Love of a wife, and hope of reconcilement, May urge beyond all spirit of revenge. Eric. What is't you meane to plot then for our safetie? Har. We'll to the pious Christian Emperor, Lewis the Debonaire; who (as you know) Do's oft solicite me to plead my right To th' Crowne, by dent of sword; that being the best (Nay onely) Patent, Reyner has to show for't. Though he from's father got it: which doth lessen Much his guilt. Eric. It's not his guilt that now most troubles him; But by more sinne to guard it. Har. Twelve thousand Expert Souldiers (that lye neere here, o' th' borders Of Germany) I may have when I list; To adde (with all speed) to our owne sure friends. And unto others that will fall in troopes, From now dishonour'd Reyner, for his base Adultery intended with Vraca, To strengthen himselfe against his wife and me. Eric. Vnheard of madnesse, so vilely to betray (And to's owne ruine) a poore and vertuous Lady; That but for him, and his damn'd shamelesse lyes, Had never marry'd any. Being withall (As 't is reported) most extreamely faire, Farre, farre beyond the other. Har. Such are the follies Of humane nature, when it is forsaken Of him that made it: But we'll now make use on't. Eric. You sho'd be suddaine, least we be layd hold on; And to take him unprepar'd. Har. When night ascends Her sable charyot, we will both of us (Mounted on our best horses) post away; And be (I hope) ere we be miss'd, pass'd danger. Come, let us therefore in, and loose no time: Which, in necessitie's a fatall crime. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fift Act. Enter Valdemar and Jnguar. Vald. You are happy beyond expectation In your Embassage: for all men did conceive (And very probably) the Queene would ayde With th' utmost of her pow'r, Harrold in his Designe for Denmarke. But, she noble Lady, (Although in outward show, she have not granted What you demand) I know (such is her vertue And loving nature) is comming in her minde, Now to assist your most ungracious King. Ing. For which in chiefe he is to you beholding; Though he deserv'd it not, at his departure. But now, Contrition has wipt off his guilt, Though not the punishment, before the gods. Nor is there any hope left us on earth, But what we now may gaine here by your meanes. Vald. Had you but beene a witnesse of her griefes. (Able to rive a heart of steele) you had Melted (as we almost did) into teares: Especially when she heard of th' infamous Marryage, with Swealands daughter (told her by A whispering flatterer:) how then she tore Her golden hayre, and us'd such cruelty On her faire limmes, which had well neere ended her (Notwithstanding what we could doe to hinder't:) Cursing the time when she e'r saw a Dane; Not for her husbands renogading most: But the losse of her virginitie, and foule Disgrace. Ing. We heard of all: Yet, were compell'd By strong necessitie (perforce) to build On her heroicke goodnesse, and your worth. Vald. 't was well conceiv'd; and better put to tryall, That compulsion may worke peace agen, Ing. Here the divine Lady comes (her selfe) unto us. Enter Landgartha, Scania, Elsinora, Fatyma, &amp; Marfisa in womans apparell with Swords on. Land. Although (Lord Inguar,) your soveraigne, and my Unkind husband, were rather to expect Sharpe warre and hate then any ayde from me In his distresse: having (as farre as 't lay In him) disgrac'd me by his flight; and as I 'd us'd false play with others: yet, my love To him (deepely engraven in my heart.) Ioyn'd to my owne innocence and merit, has (As all may see) got the upper-hand; and stopt My once intended course of strict revenge; Though he enjoy another wife, now the Mistris Of what is mine by bond. Ing. Most gracious Queene, I can say nothing, to excuse his guilt; Or lessen it: but that your vertue shines The brighter for his deepe ingratitude, Which now's the greatest Corrosive to himselfe, And cause of all his evils, by the losse Of in a manner all was his before: And that his act, has render'd both of you Famous to all the world, in different manners: You as the glorious mirrour of all worth, But him (with griefe I speake it) for's offence. Scan. Which now (deare Madame) as it is repented, Exacts your mercy more then punishment. Elsin. To prove a lasting Pyramid to all Succeeding times, of such a noble act. Vald. It can yeeld you no benefit to ruine Him and his poore subjects, being also yours; And in their loves, they're yours. Fat. Much more then his I doe beleeve. Ing. Madame. I can depose it. To Fatyma. And that they 've ever deem'd it their chiefe glory, To have had her for their Queene; their hearts he lost, When he lost her: nor is there ought can rayse The minds o' th' few, that now sticke to him, but her Strong assistance, and the try'd vallor of the Norwegian Ladies, that before Gave us the victory against the Swedes. Land. King Reyner and your selfe (Lord Inguar) have Too many friends here, to be deni'd in what Our pow'r may stead him, or you demand. And I'm the more induc'd to pardon his fault, That I acknowledge my selfe faultie too (And which my heart has oft accus'd me for, With no small griefe) in granting that to him Vnder the flattering title of marryage, which I Resolv'd ne'r to 'a' lost; and which he durst not Seeke to have forc'd from me. But it 's now past helpe. Scan. There's one way yet left (Madame) to helpe all. Land. He then transported, by his fierce desire, Which slav'd him: by craft (I'll give it no worse A name) did that wrong to my modestie, Which I (being not so deepe in passion) Might well have hinder'd; and by yeelding to it, Have given scope for others to condemne me. Ing. Which none can justly doe: For, I'm assur'd, Madame (though you have cause not to beleeve it) That his intents to your grace, were sincere At first, as now they are: and therefore (deare Queene,) You are to meete his past ill, with your goodnesse. Which, if you doe not speedily: there will be No time, nor meanes hereafter, left for you To exercise your vallor in this cause. Land. When we behold our neighbors house on fire, The Proverbe sayes we ought looke to our owne: This you conceive; and I suppose you are Inform'd by these that love you, that we have As many valiant men and women, in A readinesse, as may, if heaven be pleas'd (For we are pleas'd in 't) reinthrone your King; And chase those rebels that now urge his flight. Let then my brother (the Prince Valdemar) And you, make all the haste you can before us; With newes of our approach. And, one thing more I must intreat you doe for me: which is To deliver this Letter, unto him that Caus'd my sorrow; and left me great with child. Which fruit of his, he shall soone looke on, young Frideslaus. Vald. He sho'd 'a' stayd, to have got Such another. Scan. In honesty, he could Have done no lesse. Ing. Your graces Letter, I hope Within these three houres, he shall reade at furthest. Vald. You'll give me leave to goe before, to provide A lodging for you? Scan. Yes: for I meane to be Your bedfellow to morrow night. Vald. And I shall strayne my selfe, to bid you welcome. Ing. The King will doe as much too, for your Highnesse. Land. Fy, not so soone man, that were a shame indeed, People wo'd then say, that I went to aske it. smilingly. Nor does he neede me; having one (at least) Already to keepe him warme. Ing. He thinkes of none, But your Grace. Vald. We must be now abrupt in our Leave taking? Land. Be gone Scania, fare you well. Inguar, may all The gods be your guides. Exeunt ambo. Land. And now Marfisa. Silence declares with you, how gladly your heart Consents, to goe for Denmarke. Mar. I meane to doe Your Majestie some service there, now that You measure my affection by your owne. Scan. But what, if you come to weare the Willow garland, By the inconstancie of Captaine Hubba? Mar. Not (doe as the Queene did) forgive the offence. Fat. No lesse then 's life would satisfie your anger. Mar. Doe you make doubt on't? Elsin. I beleeve him honest. Land. What is your owne opinion? Marfisa. Mar. I still suppose the best. Land. Then wayte upon My cousin Fatyma: and both of you make haste To summon with all speede (on paine of death) All our troops (both men and women) in Ansloy, Saltsburge, and thereabouts. Our Sister and Aunt Shall to the neerer quarters; whilst I prepare Here all things requisite for our departure. And as we once made no small haste to meete King Reyner, when he brought us ayde against Our foes: let's doe the same in gratitude (And with more honour) now, in assisting of him. Those which we leave, will keepe safe here. Away. Fat. The trust impos'd on us, we'll not betray. Exeunt omnes severally. A march. Then enter Harrold, Eric, and Lothaire arm'd Har. We must make haste, Lord Lothaire, (now that by The helpe of heaven, for which we chiefly move. And the assistane which you Lord and ours, The noble Emperor Lewis, true inheritor Of his great fathers vertues did afford us, We are ascended to what is our right, Being thereto lifted by your manly worth too) To make all sure, by joyning our last issue. With Reyner, ere the brave Landgartha come (Whom he once more thinkes to deceive:) For, where Shee leads, all goes to wracke i' th' other side. Loth. It 's strange so stout a minde as hers, sho'd even Yeeld love or obedience to a man that has So basely dealt to her. Eric. She squares all her Actions by the rule of goodnesse, not Of passion; and thinkes this deede of hers, A very gratefull offering to her gods, Yet, we doe hope to send (before she land here) Her husbands rancke soule, to great Belzebub. Har. Then let's march on with speede; and trust our cause To him, that only gives life by his lawes. Exeunt a march. After the march, Enter Reyner and Hubba. Rey. Heare you no newes from Inguar (Hubba) yet Hub. Not a word: But a ship is now on entring In at the haven; and we hope it 's his. Rey. No, no. We are of all the world forsaken, But most of heaven: For, we have deserv'd it, And our repentance now comes too too late. Hub. I doe beseech you sir, not to yeeld to Such weake, unmanly diffidence. Rey. We wrong'd Thee (Hubba) too; and now thy loyaltie And kindnesse wounds our soule deeper, then if thou hadst Prov'd false, all turnes to my confusion. Hub. It was your passion and not you, strucke me, sir. Rey. Would I were quickly dead, or never borne, To see the evils which I have occasion'd, And must needs feele, if I but live a while. Hub. Your noble Queene Landgartha, will I doubt not (If i'th' meane time sir, you doe what lyes in you, With patience) soone rid you of those feares; And State you as before; and in her love too. Rey. I ne'r shall see that Halcyon day againe, To see her, Hubba, though you all suppose The contrary; and caus'd me send to move Her goodnesse. She is too magnanimous Ever to looke at such a wretch as I am, That deceiv'd her once so foulely. Hub. You'll finde Your selfe deceiv'd, I hope sir, in that ere long. Rey. Had I but faithfull prov'd to her, as she Deserv'd (thou know'st it Hubba,) I might then 'a' playd at stoole-ball with young children, or Have wasted time more idlely, if I'd listed; And have my estate multiply'd to many Kingdomes. Now, thou seest, we are not worth one Province, Stricke me heaven. Enter Valdemar and Inguar. Vald. Honest Captaine, I Am glad to meete you alive. Hub. Your Highnesse poore servant. Ing. The King walkes strangely sad. Hub. He's not himselfe: and therefore, whatsoever Newes you bring; y' had neede use your accustomed Discretion in the relating of it. Rey. You are both as welcome hither, as my Distraction will give me leave to bid you. Vald. I never knew you (sir) too much exalted At flatt'ring Fortunes smiles, or when you Conquer'd: And (now she frownes) you still ought to preserve A valiant indifferencie. Rey. Healthy men Know how t' afford good counsell unto others, Whose forces being too weake, to beare the blowes Of their diseases, yeeld and languish under The waight that 's insupportable. Jng. The weaker Their minds are, the more they yeeld; beyond Necessitie: and thereby become chiefe Actors In their owne Tragedies. Rey. I know you speake this, To prepare my minde, for the bad newes you bring. Ing. Your vertue will now most consist, in not Being over joy'd, when you read this Letter, Written and sent by her, that sayes she loves you. Rey. Let me see't. I know the hand, it's hers, O let me, let me kisse it, kisse it still, Kisses the Letter. And not presume to looke what it contaynes, To plague my guiltie conscience. Vald. reade and be rul'd. Reyner opens and Reads. If this my second duty, may prove as happy in the recovery of thy kingdomes, as my first was against a Tyrant; yet honouring thee with the victory: J shall account my travell well bestow'd. Make head bravely (as wisedome permits) against the enemie: for I am comming with all speed, to let him know, that Landgartha (being thy Queene and only lawfull Wife) is a warrior: and will prove so to his prejudice, and thy advantage: having from her heart (notwithstanding thy unkindnesse) absolv'd thee of all the wrongs thou did'st her. Landgartha. Rey. A gracious language! O you gods defend me, From turning altogether foole at this. For, my Frayle vessell is not able to contayne, The forcible excesse of this sweet comfort. My soule results so strangely, mounts, mounts up, That I have much adoe, to keepe from dancing: My nimble spirit elevats my body, And my very life (I thinke) will now with joy Forsake me, fly away. Vald. Be not in extreames, So like a meere franticke Pray recall your wits, Before she comes, you may loose all; your selfe, and us. Rey. Excuse me, worthy Cousin, you feele not The force of my impulsion. Yet, I confesse I'm (but as others are) a poore weake man; Subject to many changes 'gainst my will. Ing. Collect your selfe, were't but in obedience Enter scout. To your wise and noble Queene. What newes with you? Scout. That Harrold and his brother Eric, with A mighty pow'r of Danes and Germans, march Hither with speed, doubtlesse to force a battle. Ing. Which we must decline, till our best souldier Come: and then we are for 'em. Vald. Lead us from hence, To guard, your works; and doe not now forget (Your wish'd ayde being so neere you) your old vallor; And judgement to command. Rey. I hope we shall not. Exeunt. A march. Enter Harrold, Eric, Lothaire, and one or two more with Battle-axes. Har. Our foes have fortifi'd themselves so strongly, With Waggons, Carts, huge tymber, and deepe trenches: As 'tis impossible almost to force 'em. Eric. Which if you doe not, you 'll finde it a worse taske. To quayle Landgartha; whose fleet's now at sea; Nay hard on landing. Loth. Th' present attempt will not Perchance, prove so dangerous, as to th' eye It seemes; if we valiantly ingage Our selves in th' onset. Har. Let us boldly on then; And to conclude what hitherto, we have So prosperously atchiev'd. I will beginne: And die, rather then loose what I have wonne. Exeunt. Allarums, A while after which is begun, enter Reyner and Valdemar with Battle-axes. Rey. All's lost beyond recoverie, they are broke Vpon us in, and fight like hungry Lyons, Tearing our men to peeces, that now leave, In foule disorder. Vald. Doe you (whil'st I charge up, To give some stop unto their furie) rally And hearten yours, the best you may. For, if We can hold out, but one full houre: the noble Landgartha (that with speed incredible, Has almost landed all her forces) will be With us, to mend all agen. Rey. She shall never meet me flying. Exeunt. allarums. Enter Landgartha, Scania, Elsinora, Fatyma, and Marfisa; The foure Ladies, like Amazons. Marfisa with her Gowne tuck'd to th' midleg, spurs, &amp;c. As in the first of the third Act; Battle-axes withall. Land. You heare this Musicke, Ladies, and perceive What need our friends have of our swift assistance. We are not therefore now, to insist upon Here the Allarums sound as a farre off. A tedious consultation; or on words By me deliver'd, to encourage those Whose worths I know already. Doe you Aunt (Assisted by Fatyma and Marfisa) Lead halfe our Armie: and wheele round about (With speed and silence) to charge strongly home, Upon our enemies backes. My sister and I Will to our Husbands, that are hardly prest; Their men all routed, and a number slaine. Farewell, I hope that we shall meete againe. Exeunt severally allarums. Allarums. Then enter Reyner at one doore, and Harold at the other. Rey. Stand Traytor! Har. Thou usurper, I will stand; And could afford you other glorious titles: But that I meane not (having met you) to Waste time in words, untill your foolish sweet-heart (Whom you wo'd still deceive) come to your rescue. But now, I hope you never shall enjoy her, You know how. Rey. You shall know somewhat from me, howsoever. Here they fight, and Harrold beats Reyner under him; on which Landgartha enters, beats in Harrold and returns. Land. Is it you? I were not beholding, to Have done this for you now. Goe, look to your selfe &amp; people. Exit Land. Rey. Deare heaven, where am I? or, is this a dream? Reyner rises as she beats in Harrold. It was Landgartha sure. O no, it was not, That glory and great miracle of the world, Could not afford such grace to me, the meere Fall'n dregs of villanie. But yet, 't was she, The figure of her heavenly face, was once (And still is) so imprinted in my soule, As 't is impossible I sho'd forget her, Therefore you gods, heape all those mountaynes on me, Which the impious Gyants lifted against you, Or sincke me downe into the very Center, That I may ne'r behold her any more, That is so like you, both in shape and goodnesse. For, both I have contemn'd, and my most base Ingratitude, never appear'd at full; Till now. O Iove, pownd pownd me with thy thunder, For, my confusion is the worst of torments. Enter Scania and Valdemar. Scan. The King 's in danger; and we had need make haste To disingage him. Vald. That's done (I hope) already. Rey. Welcome deare Sister, I am asham'd to looke You in the face. Scan. We heard (sir) you were in danger. Rey. I was: But now may (when I list) goe take A nap. Wo'd the infernall dogs would teare My limbs to callops: or adde some worse torment Unto my minds affliction. Scan. You neede not Afflict your selfe so much, for ought we see: For, now the wheele is turn'd to your advantage; My Sister is friends with you too, sir. Rey. She sav'd My life, when I was downe; and ready to Receive the last (and mortall) blow. But then, Gave me so sad a looke, O loving Sister, That life which is her gift, if I must keepe In her displeasure, is much worse then death. Scan. Sir, if you will be rul'd by me, you must not Expresse too much, those vehement affections: For, she's acquainted but too well already, With your sad passion, and the continuance of it. Rey. Seeing you (deare Lady,) in love and wisedome, Esteeme that my best course: I shall be dumbe As night, calme as the calm'st evening after A stormy day. Scania, let's follow, where she went then. Exeunt. Enter Harrold and Eric. Har. After our losse and watching these two nights, I cannot brother (the toyle of our journey, Lying so heavy too, on my tyr'd body) But sleepe a little, though it be dangerous. Eric. My neede's no lesse; a little sleepe will serve. Har. Let's take it here then, the place being solitary. They sleepe, and a sweet solemne Musicke of Recorders is heard, then enter an Angel. Ang. Heaven has decreed, another day Shall gaine what you have lost. Your way Take both (as you were forc'd before) Unto the pious Emperor. One of you shall be King: whose seed Shall be so too, untill 't all bleed. Then (when that issue is extinct) Norway and Denmarkes whole precinct Shall be rul'd by Landgartha's line, And Reyners. Her the pow'rs divine Will (for her Morall vertues) turne A Christian, ere she come to th' Urne: Yeeld faith to this: For, without doubt, What I have sayd shall come about. Exit Ang. then Eric stirs and wakes Har. Eric. Sir, you sleepe exceeding soundly: Pray wake. Har. I now am fresh enough; Come, let's be gone. Eric. Dream't you nothing, while you slept? Har. No, did you? Eric. Me thought I heard a most heavenly Musicke; And that an Angel did appeare: and wish'd us, Betake our selves againe to th' Emperor, That what, we lost, another day sho'd purchase; And that the faire Landgartha (as the reward Of her Morall vertues) would be made Christian, Before she di'd. Har. Though we afford no credit Vnto such dreames: Yet, we must steere our course That way; there being (after so great a losse) No comfort left, where our foes are so strong. Eric. Heaven will in time (I hope) revenge our wrong. Exeunt. Enter Cowsell and Radgee. Cow. Come brother Radgee, it is now concluded, We shall never part agen. Rad. O deare brother, I never had a good day on't (much lesse A good night) since (being barr'd the comfort of your Sweet conversation) you parted from me. Cow. Nay brother, i can howle the same sad Madrigall Too: For looke you brother, we were all so frighted By those fat-foggy Germans (who men say Are nothing but flesh and belly:) that we durst Allow no time for mirth and drinking. Rad. Very Strange that brother. For, they say themselves are Exceeding good fellowes. Cow. Iust of that seize. Rad. I'll tell you more what I heard spoken of 'em, Brother, the 're sowre: and never worth the trusting, Or honest i' their bargaines, untill they Be drunke, or at least halfe drunke. Cow. That's as true, Brother, as that you and I drunke halfe a score Flaggons yesternight a peece. The North winde Is not so bitter in a morning, till he Has tooke a buttrum, or his Wine. Rad. And then, Makes as good Musicke, as a Bag-pipe when it's Full blow'n. What doe you thinke of the Swedes? brother. Cow. They are not (yet) altogether so good drinkers, As th' Germans are: but well fall'n to 't of late. Which makes me suppose, brother, they'll be beaten Out too. For besides, the King will no more kisse The Queene Vraca, as 't is spoken: But sticke To 's owne old Camrade, being indeed the fairer. Rad. Yet, in my opinion brother: his Grace Being marry'd to both, sho'd doe exceeding well, To keepe both still: Sleepe betwixt both 'a' nights: And imbrace both by turnes. What say you brother? Cow. What? But to concurre with you? and for many Good, and convincing reasons. 's for example: The King being kept so warme on both sides, by Two such delicate cre'tures, 't were impossible He sho'd catch cold; I, or perchance be troubl'd With Coughs, Scyaticas, or other bone-ach; And to have Swealand and Norway at command, Were a matter of no small importance, You conceive me, brother. Cow. Few wise men better, In part. But, stand aside: themselves are comming. Florish. Enter Reyner, Landgartha, Valdemar, Vraca, Scania, Inguar, Elsinora, Fatyma, Hubba and Marfisa; the Norwegian Ladies in womans apparell, with Swords on; Marfisa with her Gown untuck'd and sword on. Ing. You will not (gracious Madame) thus deceive The expectations of your poore, and loving People: whose whole hopes, comfort, safetie (nay all We can for the present, or hereafter call ours) Are but benefits deriv'd from the fountaine Of your warme bountie; at whose goodnesse yet, We most rejoyce. Doe not then (deare Empresse,) strike Sorrow to our lately bleeding hearts; that still Pant (and not slowly) by our former feares; And the sore stripes we tooke: Which, but for you, For ever were incurable; and now By your forsaking of us, will fester worse Then before. Land. That you neede not feare, Lord Inguar. For, I shall ne'r be wanting in my care, And love unto this Nation. Leaving here The best halfe of our Army, now behinde us; To prevent all future mischiefes. Jng. Our dishonour In your departure, we shall ne'r recover. Rey. My offence (which now 's my worst affliction, With what it does occasion) all may see, Tooke origen and issue, more of humane Frayltie, and foolish pride: then want of love To you; or of desert in you, to merit A better and more pow'rfull man then I am; Th' worlds onely Monarch, if there were but one, For which, I (without your mercie to restore me Once more unto your heart, as to my kingdomes) Must spend my dayes (which shall not then be many) Like to a sickely beast without a soule. Land. My heart shall still receive you: But, on my word, Th' rest of my body you shall not enjoy, sir, I now am gaunt you see, All though you must not have a feeling of it; And if I doe play false, my belly will show't Questionlesse: For, I am fruitfull if I sho'd be touch'd. Vald. Although but weakely, Madame. Land. It may be so. Scan. The Kings grace now pleads mercie, Love, and repentance: and seeing there's no feare He sho'd offend you any more, we all are Sutors for him; and will become his sureties. Land. I love him still I doe confesse: because I gave him that, no other ever had (Or shall have) from me; and mercie I have show'n In my assistance. But, the wrong he did me As I was his wife, being irreparable: I will in Iustice punish, in not paying To him (unfaithfull) the duties of a wife. For, having often prov'd the way of falshood, He may walke in't agen; and as before, Without all kinde of scruple or remorse. Sca. We'll all be bound, he shall no more leape o'r The hedge: for, if he sho'd: We that doe now goe Ioyntly for him, wo'd then prove worse then varlets, To torment him. Elsin. Come, leave your anger, and Be rul'd by those that love you. Vrac. I shall yeeld Up willingly my clayme to you, that best Deserve him. Land. Your clayme is nothing: and your Possession is but meere intrusion On what's anothers due, if she were pleas'd To challenge it; I ll say no more, because you are A woman. Vrac. I thought what I did was well done; And therefore in my minde at least am free, Being often told the lawfulnesse, by all. Land. By those that measur'd the length of their conclusions, By the crooked line of your affections. But as I kill'd your father (that had rather Then th' worth of your great dowry, have made me His second wife) I could with farre more ease (As all the world can witnesse) be reveng'd On you, and this your kinde friend: but that I wav'd Him for my husband, that despis'd me as His honest Mate; and wo'd 'a' lov'd me for By-blowes. Therefore, enjoy him still: for, I suppose You are a Hen, that must be trod. Vrac. That's more then you know; or I hope shall finde, Rey. She shall ne'r enjoy me; nor has not Of a long time I'll sweare, if that will serve. Land. It shall not (sir) beleeve it. Yet, ne'r feare You shall be arm'd i' th' front by me; which is A wrong this other lady cannot doe you, If she wo'd. Vrac. I'll leave that now for you, that have The abler bodie. Land. And you the frayler minde. But if you chop words with me thus, or insult: I may (for a farwell) cracke your birds necke, Before we part. Vrac. I must not stand so neere You then. She steps behind Reyner, and holds him betwixt Langartha and her selfe. Steps from betwixt them. Rey. Nor I prove any safeguard for you. But sho'd take part with her, whom I love best; And has best right unto me. Urac. That you say To flatter her, and for meere feare. But if I had you in private, I know what you Wo'd sing; and play too, if I sho'd but yeeld. Land. runs at her, and Elsinora steps in. Elsin. What doe you meane? Land. That I will ne'r have him, That is resolv'd. Elsin. Your resolution (I must say) in that, is worse then madnesse. Land. I'll not quarrell with you, Aunt. Yet, doe admire A Lady of your know'n modestie, should be So farre mistaken, and in such a cause. Elsin. It's you that are mistaken: I confesse I was at first an opposit in your love Vnto the King: but, seeing you would needs Yeeld (then) your virgin Forte unto his Hignesse: I now wo'd have you take what wives doe use; And let me still live chaste, that doe professe it. Scan. My Aunt sayes more (to me I am sure she did:) All ought to live according their vocation. And not preposterously prove aliens to it. Nor will it serve to say he tore the bond, Now that he's sorry for't: For, still the generall good Must be preferr'd to all particular Merit; or that devotion that may By foolish zeale, prove a too great offence. Land. I must heare more opinions, ere I part From my strong purpose: therefore sir, adieu. Be mercifull in chiefe, unto your subjects; To allure their hearts, by love: that being the tye That will hold strongest; never can be broken, Vnlesse by fooles, or mad men. For, that partie That sho'd tend any mischiefe, 'gainst a good Prince: Were first to kill all his subjects, being the Kings friends; Or perish himselfe, by his fatall and bad Purpose. Be just and vertuous, and you neede not Feare poyson, poynards, or conspiracie. To end: Norway shall be preserv'd for your young sonne; And as for me (though yours:) I'll end my life, An honest widdow, or forsaken wife. Exit with Elsinora, Fatyma, &amp; Marfisa Vald. I must take leave too. Rey. Farewell, worthiest Cousin. Scan. You know the way to Norway, Sir, and if I might advise so wise a King to follow Us thither, and not slowly: that honourable Obligation would so bind your Queene (Being seconded by us your friends, and reason) That I beleeve what now she does denie, She wo'd then grant; especially, when she Perceives you constant in your vow'd affection: For this perchance she do's to tempt and try you. Nay, I am sure she do's; and that she will be Yours againe; if you persever in your love to her, In the meane time, I shall not fayle to prove, Your grace's faithfull, loving advocate. Rey. In you the anchor of my trust lyes only fix'd, Deare sister. I must follow your advise. kisses her. Exit Scania &amp; Valdemar. Rad. O brother, brother: must we part at last? They imbrace, Exeunt Cow. &amp; Radgee. Cow. No, no: get afore; I'll steale along with you. Rey. Inguar, Did'st thinke our hopes sho'd end in this? Ing. It may prove better; and I hope it will sir. Rey. Accursed Fate of man, of foolish man, That cannot prize a Iewell while he has it, Till it be lost, and then his griefe is vaine, Vaine and unprofitable, when no hope Is left to finde it, which I feare 's my case; Our miserie the mirror's made, by which We onely see our faults, our dangerous wounds. Which likely then can never be recur'd: Being Gangreene filthy sores, that doe Corrode So farre into the very soule of man, That they hale to sad desperation. To which point I'm almost arriv'd, the Gemme I lost, being so rich, as all earths Potentates A richer could not boast. Which if I finde not (Strucke with my dyre misfortune) my owne hand Shall send my spirit to the Stygian strand. Exit with Ing. &amp; Hub. Vrac. And seeing I've walk'd astray, I will from hence: By future good to expiate my offence. Exit in the middle. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGVE. Scania (that spoke the Prologue) now delivers the Epilogue, apparelled as in the last Scene, with her Sword and Belt in her hand. Though our Author cares not, how his Play may take: Yet, cause he purposes not to forsake In his affection, any Worthy here; He hath sent me 'fore the Court breake up, to appeare For him agen; to see how it hath pleas'd: For, nothwithstanding he meanes to be eas'd; For ever of th' like taske: Yet, from his heart He wishes, you and he sho'd fairely part. And this he more (for him) desir'd me say: Where others spend a yeare about a Play (Picking a sentence here, a word from thence) This Tragie-Comedy with the expence Of lesse then two Moneths time he pen'd: For he 's not too ambitious of the dignitie Of a prime Poet; which he needs must know, The Muses chiefe (Apollo) doth bestow But very rarely. Himselfe he knowes too Better i'th' Art, then some that to be so Thought worthy, maligne him. If this please you, It's all he'll aske of Hellicon: Adieu.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some (but not of best judgements) were offended at the Conclusion of this Play, in regard Landgartha tooke not then, what she was perswaded to by so many, the Kings kind night-imbraces. To which kind of people (that know not what they say) I answer (omitting all other reasons:) that a Tragie-Comedy sho'd neither end Comically or Tragically, but betwixt both: which Decorum I did my best to observe, not to goe against Art, to please the over-amorous. To the rest of bablers, I despise any answer.</field>
