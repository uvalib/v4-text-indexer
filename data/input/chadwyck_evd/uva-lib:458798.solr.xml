For your owne sake, not ours— Mirth. Come Gossip, be not asham'd. The Play is the Staple of Newes, and you are the Mistresse, and Lady of Tatle, let's ha' your opinion of it: Do you heare Gentleman? what are you? Gentleman-vsher to the Play? pray you helpe vs to some stooles here. Prologve. Where? o' the Stage, Ladies? Mirth. Yes, o' the Stage; wee are persons of quality, I assure you, and women of fashion; and come to see, and to be seene: My Gossip Tatle here, and Gossip Expectation, and my Gossip Censure, and I am Mirth, the daugther of Christmas, and spirit of Shrouetide. They say, It's merry when Gossips meet, I hope your Play will be a merry one! Prologve. Or you wil make it such, Ladies. Bring a forme here, but what will the Noblemen thinke, or the graue Wits here, to see you seated on the bench thus? Mirth. Why, what should they thinke? but that they had Mothers, as we had, and those Mothers had Gossips (if their children were christned) as we are, and such as had a longing to see Playes, and sit vpon them, as wee doe, and arraigne both them, and their Poëts. Prologve. O! Is that your purpose? Why, Mr s. Mirth, and Madame Tatle, enioy your delights freely. Tatle. Looke your Newes be new, and fresh, Mr Prologue, and vntainted, I shall find them else, if they be stale, or flye-blowne, quickly! Prologve. Wee aske no fauour from you, onely wee would entreate of Madame Expectation— Expectation. What, Mr Prologue? Prologve. That your Ladi-ship would expect no more then you vnderstand. Expectation. Sir, I can expect enough! Prologve. I feare too much, Lady, and teach others to do the like? Expectation. I can doe that too, if I haue cause. Prologve. Cry you mercy, you neuer did wrong, but with iust cause. What's this, Lady? Mirth. Curiosity, my lady Censure. Prologve. O Curiosity! you come to see, who weares the new sute to day? whose clothes are best penn'd, what euer the part be? which Actor has the best legge and foote? what King playes without cuffes? and his Queene without gloues? who rides post in stockings? and daunces in bootes? Censvre. Yes, and which amorous Prince makes loue in drinke, or doe's ouer-act prodigiously in beaten satten, and, hauing got the tricke on't, will be monstrous still, in despight of Counsell! The Tiremen enter to mend the lights. Book-holder. Mend your lights, Gentlemen. Master Prologue, beginne. Tatle. Ay me! Expectation. Who's that? Prologve. Nay, start not Ladies, these carry no fire-workes to fright you, but a Torch i' their hands, to giue light to the businesse. The truth is, there are a set of gamesters within, in trauell of a thing call'd a Play, and would faine be deliuer'd of it: and they haue intreated me to be their Man-Midwife, the Prologue; for they are like to haue a hard labour on't. Tatle. Then the Poet has abus'd himselfe, like an Asse, as hee is. Mirth. No, his Actors will abuse him enough, or I am deceiu'd. Yonder he is within (I was i' the Tiring-house a while to see the Actors drest) rowling himselfe vp and downe like a tun, i' the midst of 'hem, and spurges, neuer did vessel of wort, or wine worke so! His sweating put me in minde of a good Shrouing dish (and I beleeue would be taken vp for a seruice of state somewhere, an't were knowne) a stew'd Poet! He doth sit like a vnbrac'd Drum with one of his heads beaten out: For, that you must note, a Poet hath two heads, as a Drum has, one for making, the other repeating, and his repeating head is all to pieces: they may gather it vp i' the tiring-house; for hee hath torne the booke in a Poeticall fury, and put himselfe to silence in dead Sacke, which, were there no other vexation, were sufficient to make him the most miserable Embleme of patience. Censvre. The Prologue, peace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGVE FOR THE STAGE. For your owne sakes, not his, he bad me say, Would you were come to heare, not see a Play. Though we his Actors must prouide for those, Who are our guests, here, in the way of showes, The maker hath not so; he'l haue you wise, Much rather by your eares, then by your eyes: And prayes you'll not preiudge his Play for ill, Because you marke it not, and sit not still; But haue a longing to salute, or talke With such a female, and from her to walke With your discourse, to what is done, and where, How, and by whom, in all the towne; but here. Alas! what is it to his Scene, to know How many Coaches in Hide-parke did show Last spring, what fare to day at Medleyes was, If Dunstan, or the Phœnix best wine has? They are things—But yet, the Stage might stand as wel, If it did neither heare these things, nor tell. Great noble wits, be good vnto your selues, And make a difference 'twixt Poetique elues, And Poets: All that dable in the inke, And defile quills, are not those few, can thinke, Conceiue, expresse, and steere the soules of men, As with a rudder, round thus, with their pen. He must be one that can instruct your youth, And keepe your Acme in the state of truth, Must enterprize this worke, marke but his wayes, What flight he makes, how new; And then he sayes, If that not like you, that he sends to night, 'Tis you haue left to iudge, not hee to write.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGVE FOR THE COVRT. A worke not smelling of the Lampe, to night, But fitted for your Maiesties disport, And writ to the Meridian of your Court, VVee bring; and hope it may produce delight: The rather, being offered, as a Rite To Schollers, that can iudge, and faire report The sense they heare, aboue the vulgar sort Of Nut-crackers, that onely come for sight. Wherein, although our Title, Sir, be Newes. Wee yet aduenture, here, to tell you none; But shew you common follies, and so knowne, That though they are not truths, th'innocent Muse Hath made so like, as Phant'sie could them state, Or Poetry, without scandall, imitate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. Scene. I. Peni-boy. Iv. Lether-legge. Gramercie Letherleg: Get me the Spurrier, His Shooemaker has pull'd on a new payre of bootes; and hee walks in his Gowne, wast coate, and trouses, expecting his Taylor. And thou hast fitted me. Let. I'll do't presently. P. Iv. Look to me, wit, and look to my wit, Land, That is, looke on me, and with all thine eyes, Male, Female, yea, Hermaphroditicke eyes, And those bring all your helpes, and perspicills, To see me at best aduantage, and augment My forme as I come forth, for I doe feele I will be one, worth looking after, shortly. Now, by and by, that's shortly. He drawes foorth his watch, and sets it on the Table. 't strikes! One, two, Three, foure, fiue, six. Inough, inough, deare watch, Thy pulse hath beate inough. Now sleepe, and rest; Would thou couldst make the time to doe so too: I'll winde thee vp no more. The houre is come So long expected! There, there, He throws off his gowne drop my wardship, My pupill age, and vassalage together. And Liberty, come throw thy selfe about me, In a rich suite, cloake, hat, and band, for now I'le sue out no mans Liuery, but miny owne, I stand on my owne feete, so much a yeere, Right, round, and sound, the Lord of mine owne ground, And (to ryme to it) threescore thousand Pound! He goes to the doore, and lookes. Not come? Not yet? Taylor thou art a vermine, Worse then the same thou prosecut'st, and prick'st In subtill seame—(Go too, I say no more) Thus to retard my longings: on the day I doe write man, to beat thee. One and twenty, Since the clock strooke, compleat! and thou wilt feele it Thou foolish Animall! I could pitty him, (An' I were not heartily angry with him now) For this one peece of folly he beares about him, To dare to tempt the Furie of an heyre, T'aboue two thousand a yeere; yet hope his custome! Well, Mr. Fashioner, theres some must breake— A head, for this your breaking. Are you come, Sir, Scene. IJ. Fashioner. Peniboy. Thomas Barber. Haberdasher. God giue your worship ioy. P. Iv.

Newly erected Here in the house, almost on the same floore, Where all the newes of all sorts shall be brought, And there be examin'd, and then registred, And so be issu'd vnder the Seale of the Office, As Staple Newes; no other newes be currant.

Then Master Ambler, Emissary Paules, A fine pac'd gentleman, as you shall see, walke The middle Ile: And then my Froy Hans Buz, A Dutch-man; he's Emissary Exhange. Fas. I had thought Mr. Burst the Marchant had had it. Tho. No, He has a rupture, hee has sprung a leake, Emissarie Westminster's vndispos'd of yet; Then the Examiner, Register, and two Clerkes, They mannage all at home, and sort, and file, And seale the newes, and issue them. P. Iv. Thom, deare Thom. What may my meanes doe for thee, aske, and haue it, I'd faine be doing some good. It is my birth-day. And I'd doe it betimes, I feele a grudging Of bounty, and I would not long lye fallow. I pray thee thinke, and speake, or wish for something. Tho. I would I had but one o' the Clerkes places, I'this Newes Office,. P. Iv. Thou shalt haue it, Thom, If siluer, or gold will fetch it; what's the rate? At what is't set i'the Mercat? Tho. Fiftie pound, Sir. P. Iv. An't were a hundred, Thom, thou shalt not want it. Fas. The Taylor leapes, and embraceth him. O Noble Master! P. Iv. How now Æsops Asse!

And deal'st in sattins and veluets, and rich plushes, Thou canst not spin all formes out of thy selfe; They are quite other things: I thinke this suite Has made me wittier, then I was. Fas. Belieue it Sir, That clothes doe much vpon the wit, as weather Do's on the braine; and thence comes your prouerbe; The Taylor makes the man: I speake by experience Of my owne Customers. I haue had Gallants, Both Court and Countrey, would ha' fool'd you vp In a new suite, with the best wits, in being, And kept their speed, as long as their clothes lasted Han'some, and neate; but then as they grew out At the elbowes againe, or had a staine, or spot, They haue sunke most wretchedly. P. Iv. What thou report'st, Is but the common calamity, and seene daily; And therefore you haue another answering prouerbe: A broken sleeue keepes the arme backe, Fas. 'Tis true, Sir. And thence wee say, that such a one playes at peepe arme. P. Iv. Doe you so? it is wittily sayd. I wonder, Gentlemen, And men of meanes will not maintaine themselues Fresher in wit, I meane in clothes, to the highest. For hee that's out o' clothes, is out o'fashion, And out of fashion, is out of countenance, And out o' countenance, is out o' Wit. Is not Rogue Haberdasher come? Hab. Yes, here, Sir. They are all about him, busie. I ha' beene without this halfe houre. P. Iv. Giue me my hat. Put on my Girdle-Rascall, sits my Ruffe well? Lin. In print. P. Iv. Slaue. Lin. See your selfe. P. Iv.

I should ha' made shift To haue laught as heartily in my mourners hood, As in this Suite, if it had pleas'd my father To haue beene buried, with the Trumpeters: Pic. The Heralds of Armes, you meane. P. Iv. I meane, All noyse, that is superfluous! Pic. All that idle pompe, And vanity of a Tombe-stone, your wise father Did, by his will, preuent. Your worship had— P. Iv. A louing and obedient father of him, I know it: a right, kinde-natur'd man, To dye soopportunely. Pic.

Pic. Know you, why I bought it Sr? P. Iv. Not I. Pic. To worke for you, and carry a myne Against the Master of it, Master Cymball; Who hath a plot vpon a Gentlewoman, Was once design'd for you, Sir. P. Iv. Me? Pic. Your father, Old Master Peni-boy, of happy memory, And wisdome too, as any i'the County, Carefull to finde out a fit match for you, In his owne life time (but hee was preuented) Left it in writing in a Schedule here, To be annexed to his Will; that you, His onely Sonne, vpon his charge, and blessing, Should take due notice of a Gentlewoman, Soiourning with your vncle, Richer Peni-boy. P. Iv. A Cornish Gentlewoman, I doe know her, Mistresse, Pecunia doe-all. Pic. A great Lady, Indeede shee is, and not of mortall race, Infanta of the Mines; her Graces Grandfather, Was Duke, and Cousin to the King of Ophyr, The Subterranean, let that passe. Her name is Or rather, her three names are (for such shee is) Aurelia Clara Pecunia, A great Princesse Of mighty power, though shee liue in priuate With a contracted family! Her Secretary— P. Ca. Who is her Gentleman-vsher too. Pic. One Broker, And then two Gentlewomen; Mistresse Statute, And Mistresse Band, with Waxe the Chambermaide, And Mother Mortgage, the old Nurse, two Groomes, Pawne, and his fellow; you haue not many to bribe, Sir. The worke is feizible, and th'approches easie, By your owne kindred. Now, Sir, Cymball thinkes, The Master here, and gouernor o' the Staple, By his fine arts, and pompe of his great place To draw her! He concludes, shee is a woman! And that so soone as sh' heares of the New Office, Shee'll come to visit it, as they all haue longings After new sights, and motions! But your bounty, Person, and brauery must atchieue her. P. Ca.

It is an action you were built for, Sir, Pic. And none but you can doe it. P. Iv. I'll vndertake it, P. Ca. And carry it. P. Iv. Feare me not, for since I came Of mature age, I haue had a certaine itch In my right eye, this corner, here, doe you see? To doe some worke, and worthy of a Chronicle. The first Intermeane after the first Act. Mirth. How now Gossip! how doe's the Play please you? Censvre. Very scuruily, me thinks, and sufficiently naught. Expectation. As a body would wish: here's nothing but a young Prodigall, come of age, who makes much of the Barber, buyes him a place in a new Office, i' the ayre, I know not where, and his man o' Law to follow him, with the Begger to boote, and they two helpe him to a wife. Mirth. I, shee is a proper piece! that such creatures can broke for. Tatle. I cannot abide that nasty fellow, the Begger, if hee had beene a Court-Begger in good clothes; a Begger in veluet, as they say, I could haue endur'd him. Mirth. Or a begging scholler in blacke, or one of these beggerly Poets, gossip, that would hang vpon a young heyre like a horseleech. Expec. Or a thred-bare Doctor of Physicke, a poore Quackesaluer. Censvre. Or a Sea-captaine, halfe steru'd. Mirth. I, these were tolerable Beggers, Beggers of fashion! you shall see some such anon! Tatle. I would faine see the Foole, gossip, the Foole is the finest man t'the company, they say, and has all the wit: Hee is the very Iustice o' Peace o'the Play, and can cemmit whom hee will, and what hee will, errour, absurdity, as the toy takes him, and no man say, blacke is his eye, but laugh at him. Mirth. But they ha' no Foole i' this Play, I am afraid, gossip. Tatle. It's a wise Play, then. Expectation. They are all fooles, the rather, in that. Censvre. Like enough. Tatle. My husband, (Timony Tatle, God rest his poore soule) was wont to say, there was no Play without a Foole, and a Diuell in't; he was for the Diuell still, God blesse him. The Diuell for his money would hee say, I would faine see the Diuell. And why would you so faine see the Diuell? would I say. Because hee has hornes, wife, and may be a cuckold, as well as a Diuell, hee would answer: You are e'en such another, husband, quoth I. Was the Diuell euer married? where doe you read, the Diuell was euer so honorable to commit Matrimony; The Play will tell vs, that, sayes hee, wee'll goe see't to morrow, the Diuell is an Asse. Hee is an errant learn'd man, that made it, and can write, they say, and I am fouly deceiu'd, but hee can read too. Mirth. I remember it gossip, I went with you, by the same token, Mr s. Trouble Truth diswaded vs, and told vs, hee was a prophane Poet, and all his Playes had Diuels in them. That he kept schole vpo' the Stage, could coniure there, aboue the Schole of Westminster, and Doctor Lamb too: not a Play he made, but had a Diuell in it. And that he would learne vs all to make our husbands Cuckolds at Playes: by another token, that a young married wife i' the company, said, shee could finde in her heart to steale thither, and see a little o' the vanity through her masque, and come practice at home. Tatle. O, it was, Mistresse— Mirth. Nay, Gossip, I name no body. It may be 'twas my selfe. Expectation. But was the Diuell a proper man, Gossip? Mirth. As fine a gentleman, of his inches, as euer I saw trusted to the Stage, any where else: and lou'd the common wealth, as well as ere a Patriot of 'hem all: hee would carry away the Vice on his backe, quicke to Hell, in euery Play where he came, and reforme abuses. Expectation. There was the Diuell of Edmonton, no such man, I warrant you. Censvre. The Coniurer coosen'd him with a candles end, hee was an Asse. Mirth. But there was one Smug, a Smith, would haue made a horse laugh, and broke his halter, as they say. Tatle. O, but the poore man had got a shrewd mischance, one day. Expectation. How, Gossip? Tatle. He had drest a Rogue Iade i' the morning, that had the Staggers, and had got such a spice of 'hem himselfe, by noone, as they would not away all the Play time, doe what hee could, for his heart. Mirth. 'Twas his part, Gossip, he was to be drunke, by his part. Tatle. Say you so, I vnderstood not so much. Expecta. Would wee had such an other part, and such a man in this play, I feare 'twill be an excellent dull thing. Censvre. Expect, intend it.</field>

You doe not looke vpon me with that face, As you were wont, my Goddesse, bright Pecunia: Although your Grace be falne, of two i' the hundred, In vulgar estimation; yet am I, You Graces seruant still: and teach this body, To bend, and these my aged knees to buckle, In adoration, and iust worship of you. Indeed, I doe confesse, I haue no shape To make a minion of, but I'm your Martyr, Your Graces Martyr.

Has she all those Titles, and her Grace besides, I must correct that ignorance and ouer-sight, Before I doe present. Sir, I haue drawne A Pedigree for her Grace, though yet a Nouice In that so noble study. Bro. A Herald at Armes? Pye. No Sir, a Pursiuant, my name is Pyed-mantle. Bro. Good Master Pyed-mantle. Pye.

Before Sr, long before, you haue done nothing else, Your Mines were before Adam, search your Office, Rowle fiue and twenty, you will finde it so, I see you are but a Nouice, Master Pyed-mantle. If you had not told mee so. Pye. Sir, an apprentise In armoiry. I haue read the Elements, And Accidence, and all the leading bookes, And I haue, now, vpon me a great ambition, How to be brought to her Grace, to kisse her hands. Bro. Why, if you haue acquaintance with Mistresse Statute, Or Mistresse Band, my Ladies Gentlewomen, They can induce you. One is a Iudges Daughter, But somewhat stately; th'other Mistresse Band, Her father's but a Scriuener, but shee can Almost as much with my Lady, as the other, Especially, if Rose Waxe the Chambermaid Be willing. Doe you not know her, Sir, neither? Pye. No in troth Sir. Bro.

Why? you could do me, If you would, now, this fauour of your selfe. Bro. Truely, I thinke I could: but if I would, I hardly should, without, or Mistresse Band, Or Mistresse Statute, please to appeare in it. Or the good Nurse I told you of, Mistresse Mortgage. We know our places here, wee mingle not One in anothers sphere, but all moue orderly, In our owne orbes; yet wee are all Concentricks. Pye. Well, Sir, I'll waite a better season. Bro. Doe, And study the right meanes, get Mistresse Band Broker makes a mouth at him. To vrge on your behalfe, or little Waxe. Pye. I haue a hope, Sir, that I may, by chance, Light on her Grace, as she's taking the ayre: He ieeres him againe. Bro. That ayre of hope, has blasted many an ayrie Of Castrills like your selfe: Good Master Pyed-mantle, Old Peny-boy leaps P. Se. Well said, Master Secretary, I stood behinde And heard thee all. I honor thy dispatches. If they be rude, vntrained it our method And haue not studied the rule, dismisse 'hem quickly, Where's Lickfinger my Cooke? that vnctuous rascall? Hee'll neuer keepe his houre, that vessell of kitchinstuffe! Scene. IIJ. Broker. Peny-boy. Se. Lick-finger. Heere hee is come, Sir. P. Se. Pox vpon him kidney, Alwaies too late! Lic. To wish 'hem you, I confesse, That ha' them already. P. Se. What? Lic. The pox! P. Se. The piles, The plague, and all diseases light on him, Knowes not to keepe his word. I'ld keepe my word sure! I hate that man that will not keepe his word, When did I breake my word? Lic. Or I, till now? And 'tis but halfe an houre. P. Se. Halfe a yeere: To mee that stands vpon a minute of time. I am a iust man, I loue still to be iust. Lic. Why? you thinke I can runne like light-foot Ralph, Or keep a wheele-barrow, with a sayle in towne here, To whirle me to you: I haue lost two stone Of suet i'the seruice posting hither, You might haue followed me like a watering-pot, And seene the knots I made along the street; My face dropt like the skimmer in a fritter panne, And my whole body, is yet (to say the truth) A rosted pound of butter, with grated bread in't! He sweepes his face. P. Se. Belieue you, he that list. You stay'd of purpose, To haue my venison stinke, and my fowle mortify'd, That you might ha' 'hem— Lic. A shilling or two cheaper, That's your iealousie. P. Se. Perhaps it is. Will you goe in, and view, and value all? Yonder is venison sent mee! fowle! and fish! In such abundance! I am sicke to see it! I wonder what they meane! I ha' told 'hem of it! To burthen a weake stomacke! and prouoke A dying appetite! thrust a sinne vpon me I ne'r was guilty of! nothing but gluttony! Grosse gluttony! that will vndoe this Land! Lic. And bating two i'the hundred. P. Se. I, that same's A crying sinne, a fearefull damn'd deuice, Eats vp the poore, deuoures 'hem— Lic. Sir, take heed What you giue out. P. Se. Against your graue great Solons? Numæ Pompilij, they that made that Law? To take away the poore's inheritance? It was their portion: I will stand to't. And they haue rob'd 'hem of it, plainly rob'd 'hem, I still am a iust man, I tell the truth. When moneies went at Ten i'the hundred, I, And such as I, the seruants of Pecunia, Could spare the poore two out of ten, and did it, How say you, Broker? Lic. (Ask your Eccho) Bro. You did it. P. Se. I am for Iustice, when did I leaue Iustice? We knew 'twas theirs, they had right and Title to't. Now— Lic. You can spare 'hem nothing. P. Se. Very little, Lic. As good as nothing. P. Se. They haue bound our hands With their wise solemne act, shortned our armes. Lic. Beware those worshipfull eares, Sir, be not shortned, And you play Crop i the fleet, if you vse this licence. P. Se. What licence, Knaue? Informer? Lic. I am Lickfinger, Your Cooke. P. Se. A saucy Iacke you are, that's once; VVhat said I Broker? Bro. Nothing that I heard, Sir. Lic. I know his gift, hee can be deafe when he list. P. Se. Ha' you prouided me my bushell of egges? I did bespeake? I doe not care how stale, Or stincking that they be; let 'hem be rotten: For ammunition here to pelt the boyes, That breake my windowes? Lic. Yes Sir, I ha' spar'd 'hem Out of the custard politique for you, the Maiors. P. Se. 'Tis well, goe in, take hence all that excesse, Make what you can of it, your best: and when I haue friends, that I inuite at home, prouide mee Such, such, and such a dish, as I bespeake; One a time, no superfluitie. Or if you haue it not, returne mee money; You know my waies. Lic. They are a little crooked. P. Se. How knaue? Lic. Because you do indent. P. Se. 'Tis true, Sir, I do indent you shall returne me money. Lic. Rather then meat, I know it: you are iust still. P. Se. I loue it still. And therefore if you spend The red-Deere pyes i'your house, or sell 'hem forth, Sir, Cast so, that I may haue their coffins all, Return'd here, and pil'd vp: I would be thought To keepe some kind of house. Lic. By the mouldie signes? P. Se. And then remember meat for my two dogs: Fat flaps of mutton; kidneyes; rumps of veale; Good plentious scraps; my maid shall eat the reliques. Lic. VVhen you &amp; your dogs haue din'd. A sweet reuersion. P. Se. VVho's here? my Courtier? and my little Doctor? My Muster-Master? and what Plouer's that They haue brought to pull? Bro. I know not, some green Plouet. I'le find him out. P. Se. Doe, for I know the rest, They are the Icerers, mocking, flouting Iackes. Scene. IV. Fitton. Peni-boy. Se. Almanach. Shvnfield. Madrigal.

Our selues. Alm. Wee'l be one bound for another. Fit. This noble Doctor here. Alm. This worthy Courtier. Fit. This Man o' war, he was our Muster-Master. Alm. But a Sea-Captaine now, braue Captaine Shun-field. He holds vp his nose. Shvn. You snuffe the ayre now, as the scent displeas'd you? Fit. Thou needst not feare him man, his credit is found, Alm. And season'd too, since he tooke salt at Sea. P. Se. I doe not loue pickl'd security, Would I had one good Fresh-man in for all; For truth is, you three stinke. Shv. You are a Rogue, P. Se. I thinke I am, but I will lend no money On that security, Captaine. Alm. Here's a Gentleman, A Fresh-man i'the world, one Master Madrigall. Fit. Of an vntainted credit; what say you to him? Madrigall steps aside with Broker. Shv. Hee's gone me thinkes, where is he? Madrigall? P. Se. H' has an odde singing name, is he an Heyre? Fit. An Heyre to a faire fortune, Alm. And full hopes: A dainty Scholler, and a pretty Poët! P. Se. Y'aue said enough. I ha' no money, Gentlemen, An' he goe to't in ryme once, not a penny. He snuffes againe. Shv. Why, hee's of yeares, though he haue little beard. P. Se. His beard has time to grow. I haue no money: Let him still dable in Poetry. No Pecunia Is to be seene. Alm. Come, thou lou'st to be costiue Still i' thy curt'sie; but I haue a pill, A golden pill to purge away this melancholly. Shv. Tis nothing but his keeping o'the house here, With his two drowsie doggs. Fit. A drench of sacke At a good tauerne, and a fine fresh pullet, Would cure him. Lic. Nothing but a yong Haire in white-broth, I know his diet better then the Doctor. Shv. What Lick-finger? mine old host of Ram-Alley? You ha' some mercat here. Alm. Some dosser of Fish Or Fowle to fetch of. Fit. An odde bargaine of Venison, To driue. P. Se. Will you goe in, knaue? Lic. I must needs, You see who driues me, gentlemen. Alm. Not the diuell. Fit, Hee may be in time, hee is his Agent, now. P. Se. You are all cogging Iacks, a Couy o' wits, The Ieerers, that still call together at meales: Or rather an Airy, for you are birds of prey: Peny-boy thrusts him in. And flie at all, nothing's too bigge or high for you. And are so truely fear'd, but not belou'd One of another: as no one dares breake Company from the rest, lest they should fall, Vpon him absent. Alm. O! the onely Oracle That euer peept, or spake out of a dublet. Shv. How the rogue stinks, worse then a Fishmonger sleeues! Fit. Or Curriers hands! Shv. And such a perboil'd visage! Fit.

No certaine species sure, A kinde of mule! That's halfe an Ethnicke, halfe a Christian! P. Se. I haue no monie, gentlemen. Shv. This stocke. He has no sense of any vertue, honour, Gentrie or merit. P. Se. You say very right, My meritorious Captaine, (as I take it!) Merit will keepe no house, nor pay no house rent. Will Mistresse Merit goe to mercat, thinke you? Set on the pot, or feed the family? Will Gentry cleare with the Butcher? or the Baker? Fetch in a Phessant, or a brace of Partridges, From good-wife Poulter, for my Ladies supper. Fit. See! this pure rogue! P. Se. This rogue has money tho', My worshipfull braue Courtier has no money. No, nor my valiant Captaine. Shv. Hang you rascall. P. Se. Nor you, my learned Doctor. I lou'd you Whil you did hold your practice, and kill tripe wiues. And kept you to your vrinall; but since your thombes Haue greas'd the Ephemerides, casting figures, And turning ouer for your Candle-rents, And your twelue houses in the Zodiacke: With your Almutens, Alma cantaras, Troth you shall cant alone for Peny-boy. Shv. I told you what we should find him, a meere Bawd. Fit. A rogue, a cheater. P. Se. What you please, gentlemen, I am of that humble nature and condition, Neuer to minde your worships, or take notice Of what you throw away, thus. I keepe house here Like a lame Cobler, neuer out of doores, With my two dogs, my friends, and (as you say) Driue a quicke pretty trade, still. I get money: And as for Titles, be they Rogue, or Rascall, Or what your worships fancy, let 'hem passe As transitory things; they're mine to day, And yours to morrow. Alm. Hang thee dog. Shv. Thou curre. P. Se. You see how I doe blush, and am asham'd Of these large attributes? yet you haue no money. Alm. Well wolfe, Hyæna, you old pockie rascall, You will ha' the Hernia fall downe againe Into your Scrotum, and I shall be sent for. I will remember then, that; and your Fistula In ano, I cur'd you of. P. Se. Thanke your dog-leech craft. They were 'holesome piles, afore you meddl'd with 'hem. Alm. What an vngratefull wretch is this? Shv.

More then a logge, of any grace at Court, A man may doe him: or that such a Lord Reach't him his hand. P. Se. O yes! if grace would strike The brewers Tally, or my good Lords hand, Would quit the scores. But Sir, they will not doe it. Here's a piece, my good Lord piece, doth all. He shewes a piece. Goes to the Butehers. fetches in a muton, Then to the Bakers, brings in bread, makes fires, Gets wine, and does more reall Curtesies, Then all my Lords, I know: My sweet Lord peece! You are my Lord, the rest are cogging Iacks, Vnder the Rose. Shv. Rogue, I could beat you now, P. Se. True Captaine, if you durst beat any other. I should belieue you, but indeed you are hungry; You are not angry Captaine, if I know you Aright; good Captaine. No, Pecunia, Is to be seene, though Mistresse Band would speake, Or little Blushet-Waxe, be ne'r so easie, I'll stop mine eares with her, against the Syrens, Court, and Philosophy. God be wi you, Gentlemen, Prouide you better names. Pecunia is for you. Fit. What a damn'd Harpy it is? where's Madrigall? Is he sneek'd hence. Shv. Here he comes with Broker, Madrigall returnes. Pecunia's Secretary. Alm. He may doe some good With him perhaps. Where ha you beene Madrigall? Mad. Aboue with my Ladies women, reading verses. Fit. That was a fauour. Good morrow, Master Secretary. Shv. Good morrow, Master Vsher. Alm. Sir, by both Your worshipfull Titles, and your name Mas Broker. Good morrow. Mad. I did aske him if hee were Amphibion Broker. Shv. Why? Alm. A creature of two natures, Because hee has two Offices. Bro. You may ieere, You ha' the wits, young Gentlemen. But your hope Of Helicon, will neuer carry it, heere, With our fat family; we ha' the dullest, Most unboar'd Eares for verse amongst our females. I grieu'd you read so long, Sir, old Nurse Mortgage, Shee snoar'd i'the Chaire, and Statute (if you mark'd her) Fell fast a sleepe, and Mistresse Band, shee nodded, But not with any consent to what you read. They must haue somwhat else to chinke, then rymes. If you could make an Epitaph on your Land, (Imagine it on departure) such a Poem Would wake 'hem, and bring Waxe to her true temper. Mad. I faith Sir, and I will try. Bro. 'Tis but earth, Fit to make brickes and tyles of. Shv. Pocks vpon't 'Tis but for pots, or pipkins at the best. If it would keepe vs in good tabacco pipes, Bro. 'Twere worth keeping. Fit. Or in porc'lane dishes There were some hope. Alm. But this is a hungry soile, And must be helpt. Fit. Who would hold any Land To haue the trouble to marle it. Shv. Not a gentleman. Bro. Let clownes and hyndes affect it, that loue ploughes, And carts, and harrowes, and are busie still, In vexing the dull element. Alm. Our sweete Songster Shall rarifie't into ayre. Fit. And you Mas. Broker Shall haue a feeling. Bro. So it supple, Sir, The nerues. Mad. O! it shall be palpable, Make thee runne thorow a hoope, or a thombe-ring, The nose of a tabacco pipe, and draw Thy ductile bones out, like a knitting needle, To serue my subtill turnes. Bro. I shall obey. Sir, And run a thred, like an houre-glasse. P. Se. Where is Broker? Are not these flies gone yet? pray quit my house, I'le smoake you cut else. Fit. O! the Prodigall! Will you be at so much charge with vs, and losse? Mad. I haue heard you ha' offered Sir, to lock vp smoake, And cauke your windores, spar up all your doores, Thinking to keepe it a close prisoner wi you, And wept, when it went out, Sir, at your chimney. Fit. And yet his eyes were dryer then a pummise. Shv. A wretched rascall, that will binde about The nose of his bellowes, lest the wind get out When hee's abroad. Alm. Sweepes downe no cobwebs here, But sells 'hem for cut-fingers. And the spiders, As creatures rear'd of dust, and cost him nothing, To fat old Ladies monkeyes. Fit. Hee has offerd To gather vp spilt water, and preserue Each haire falls from him to stop balls with all. Shv. A slaue, and an Idolater to Pecunia! P. Se. You all haue happy memories, Gentlemen, In rocking my poore cradle. I remember too, When you had lands, and credit, worship, friends, I, and could giue security: now, you haue none, Or will haue none right shortly. This can time, And the vicissitude of things. I haue All these, and money too, and doe possesse 'hem, And am right heartily glad of all our memories, And both the changes. Fit. Let vs leaue the viper. P. Se. Hee's glad he is rid of his torture, and so soone. Broker, come hither, vp, and tell your Lady, Shee must be readie presently, and Statute, Band, Mortgage, VVax. My prodigall young kinsman Will streight be here to see her; 'top of our house, The flourishing, and flanting Peny-boy. Wee were but three of vs in all the world, My brother Francis, whom they call'd Franck Peny-boy, Father to this: hee's dead. This Peny-boy, Is now the heire! I, Richer Peny-boy, Not Richard, but old Harry Peny-boy, And (to make rime) close, wary Peny-boy I shall haue all at last, my hopes doe tell me. Goe, see all ready; and where my dogs haue falted, Remoue it with a broome, and sweeten all VVith a slice of iuniper, not too much, but sparing, VVe may be faultie our selues else, and turne prodigall, In entertaining of the Prodigall. Here hee is! and with him—what! a Clapper Dudgeon! That's a good signe; to haue the begger follow him, So neere at his first entry into fortune. Scene V. Peny-Boy. Iv. Peni-boy. Sen. Piclock.

Nay, kinsman, My worshipfull kinsman, and the top of our house, Doe not your peninet vncle that affront, For a rash word, to leaue his ioyfull threshold, Before you see the Lady that you long for. The Venus of the time, and state, Pecunia! I doe perceiue, your bounty loues the man, For some concealed vertue, that he hides Vnder those rags. P. Ca.

When I was told of your arriuall here, I felt my heart beat, as it would leape out, In speach; and all my face it was a flame, But how it came to passe I doe not know. P. Iv.

A fine well-spoken family. What's thy name? Bro. Broker. P. Iv. Me thinks my vncle should not need thee, Who is a crafty Knaue, enough, beleeue it. Art thou her Graces Steward? Bro. No, her Vsher Sir. P. Iv. What, o' the Hall? thou hast a sweeping face, Thy beard is like a broome. Bro. No barren chin, Sir, I am no Eunuch, though a Gentleman-Vsher. P. Iv. Thou shalt goe with vs. Vncle, I must haue My Princesse forth to day. P. Se. Whither you please, Sir, You shall command her. Pec. I will doe all grace To my new seruant. P. Se. Thanks vnto your bounty; He is my Nephew, and my Chiefe, the Point, Old Peny-boy thankes her, but makes his condition. Tip, Top, and Tuft of all our family! But, Sir, condition'd alwaies, you returne Statute, and Band home, with my sweet, soft Waxe, And my good Nurse, here, Mortgage. P. Iv. O! what else? P. Se. By Broker. P. Iv. Do not feare. P. Se. She shall go wi' you, Whither you please, Sir, any where. P. Ca. I see A Money-Bawd, is lightly a Flesh-Bawd, too. Pic. Are you aduis'd? Now o' my faith, this Canter Would make a good graue Bargesse in some Barne. P. Iv. Come, thou shalt go with vs, vncle. P. Ca. By no meanes, Sir. P. Iv. We'll haue both Sack, and Fidlers. P. Se. I'll not draw That charge vpon your worship. P. Ca. He speakes modestly, And like an Vncle, P. Se. But Mas Broker, here, He shall attend you, Nephew; her Graces Vsher, And what you fancy to bestow on him, Be not too lauish, vse a temperate bounty, I'll take it to my selfe. P. Iv.

Let your meat rather follow you, to a tauerne. Pic. A tauern's as vnfit too, for a Princesse. P. Ca. No, I haue knowne a Princesse, and a great one, Come forth of a tauerne. Pic. Not goe in, Sir, though. P. Ca. She must goe in, if she came forth: the blessed Pokahontas (as the Historian calls her And great Kings daughters of Virginia) Hath bin in womb of a tauerne; and besides, Your nasty Vncle will spoyle all your mirth, And be as noysome. Pic. That's true. P. Ca. No 'faith, Dine in Apollo with Pecunia, At braue Duke Wadloos, haue your friends about you, And make a day on't. P. Iv. Content 'ifaith: Our meat shall be brought thither.

I warrant you. The second Intermeane after the second Act. Censvre. Why, this is duller and duller! intolerable! scuruy! neither Diuel nor Foole in this Play! pray God, some on vs be not a witch, Gossip, to forespeake the matter thus. Mirth. I feare we are all such, and we were old enough: But we are not all old enough to make one witch. How like you the Vice i' the Play. Expectation. Which is he? Mir. Three or foure: old Couetousnesse, the sordid Peny-boy, the Money-bawd, who is a flesh-bawd too, they say. Tatle. But here is neuer a Fiend to carry him away. Besides, he has neuer a wooden dagger! I'ld not giue a rush for a Vice, that has not a wooden dagger to snap at euery body he meetes. Mirth. That was the old way, Gossip, when Iniquity came in like Hokos Pokos, in a Iuglers ierkin, with false skirts. like the Knaue of Clubs! but now they are attir'd like men and women o' the time, the Vice, male and female! Prodigality like a young keyre, and his Mistresse Money (whose fauours he scatters like counters) prank't vp like a prime Lady, the Infanta of the Mines. Cen. I, therein they abuse an honorable Princesse, it is thought. Mirth. By whom is it so thought? or where lies the abuse? Cen. Plaine in the stiling her Infanta, and giuing her three names. Mirth. Take heed, it lie not in the vice of your interpretation: what haue Aurelia, Clara, Pecunia to do with any person? do they any more, but expresse the property of Money, which is the daughter of earth, and drawne out of the Mines? Is there nothing to be call'd Infanta, but what is subiect to exception? Why not the Infanta of the Beggers? or Infanta o' the Gipsies? as well as King of Beggers, and King of Gipsies? Cen. Well, and there were no wiser then I, I would sow him in a sack, and send him by sea to his Princesse. Mirt. Faith, and hee heard you Censure, he would goe neere to sticke the Asses eares to your high dressing, and perhaps to all ours for harkening to you. Tatle. By'r Lady but he should not to mine, I would harken, and harken, and censure, if I saw cause, for th'other Princesse sake Pokahontas, surman'd the blessed, whom hee has abus'd indeed (and I doe censure him, and will censure him) to say she came foorth of a Tauerne, was said like a paltry Poet. Mirth. That's but one Gossips opinion, and my Gossip Tatle's too! but what saies Expectation, here, she sits sullen and silent. Exp. Troth I expect their Office, their great Office! the Staple, what it will be! they haue talk't on't, but wee see't not open yet; would Butter would come in, and spread it-selfe a little to us. Mirth. Or the butter-box, Buz, the Emissary. Tatle. When it is churn'd, and dish't, we shall heare of it. Exp. If it be fresh and sweet butter; but say it be sower and wheyish. Mir. Then it is worth nothing, meere pot butter, fit to be spent in suppositories, or greasing coach-wheeles, stale stinking butter, and such I feare it is, by the being barrell'd up so long. Expectation. Or ranke Irish butter. Can. Haue patience Gossips, say that contrary to our expectations it proue right, seasonable, salt butter. Mir. Or to the time of yeer, in Lent, delicate Almond butter! I haue a sweet tooth yet, and I will hope the best; and sit downe as quiet, and calme as butter, looke as smooth, and soft as butter; be merry, and melt like butter; laugh and be fat like butter: so butter answer my expectation, and be not mad butter; If it be: It shall both Iuly and December see. I say no more, But—Dixi. TO THE READERS. In this following Act, the Office is open'd, and shew'n to the Prodigall, and his Princesse Pecunia, wherein the allegory, and purpose of the Author hath hitherto beene wholly mistaken, and so sinister an interpretation beene made, as if the soules of most of the Spectator, had liu'd in the eyes and eares of these ridiculous Gossips that tattle betweene the Acts. But hee prayes you thus to mend it. To consider the Newes here vented, to be none of his Newes, or any reasonable mans; but Newes made like the times Newes, (a weekly cheat to draw mony) and could not be fitter reprehended, then in raising this ridiculous Office of the Staple, wherin the age may see her owne folly, or hunger and thirst after publish'd pamphlets of Newes, set out euery Saturday, but made all at home, &amp; no syllable of truth in them: then which there cannot be a greater disease in nature, or a fouler scorne put vpon the times. And so apprehending it, you shall doe the Author, and your owne iudgement a courtesie, and perceiue the tricke of alluring money to the Office, and there cooz'ning the people. If you haue the truth, rest quiet, and consider that Ficta, voluptatis causa, sint proxima veris.</field>

I would haue You waited on by Ladies, and your traine Borne vp by persons of quality, and honour, Your meat should be seru'd in with curious dances, And set vpon the boord, with virgin hands, Tun'd to their voices; not a dish remou'd, But to the Musicke, nor a drop of wine, Mixt, with his water, without Harmony, Pec. You are a Courtier, Sir, or somewhat more; That haue this tempting language! Cym. I'm your seruant, Exellent Princesse, and would ha' you appeare That, which you are. Come forth State, and wonder, Of these our times, dazle the vulgar eyes. And strike the people blind with admiration. P. Can. Why, that's the end of wealth! thrust riches outward, And remaine beggers within: contemplate nothing But the vile sordid things of time, place, money, And let the noble, and the precious goe, Vertue and honesty; hang 'hem; poore thinne membranes Of honour; who respects them?

And therefore he is faine by a designe, To carry 'hem in the ayre, and at some distance, Till he be married, then they shall appeare. Lic. Or neuer; well, God b'wi'you (stay, who's here?) A little of the Duke of Bauier, and then— The Duke of Bauier. Cla. H'has taken a gray habit, and is turn'd The Churches Millar, grinds the catholique grist With euery wind: and Tilly takes the toll.

It expected More then it vnderstood: for, they stand mute, Poore innocent dumb things; they are but wood. As is the bench and blocks, they were wrought on, yet If May-day come, and the Sunne shine, perhaps, They'll sing like Memnons Statue, and be vocall. Cvs. 5. Ha'you any Forest-newes? Tho. None very wild, Sir, 5. Cust. The new Parke in the Forrest of Fooles. Some tame there is, out o'the Forrest of fooles, A new Parke is a making there, to seuer Cuckolds of Antler, from the Rascalls.

Almanack. Madrigal. Clerkes. By your leaue, Clerkes, Where shall we dine to day? doe you know? the Ieerers. Alm. Where's my fellow Fitton? Tho. New gone forth. Shv. Cannot your Office tell vs, what braue fellowes Doe eat together to day, in towne, and where? Tho. Yes, there's a Gentleman, the braue heire, yong Peny-boy. Dines in Apollo. Mad. Come, let's thither then, I ha 'supt in Apollo! Alm. With the Muses? Mad. No, But with two Gentlewomen, call'd, the Graces. Alm. They' were euer three in Poetry. Mad. This was truth, Sir: Tho. Sir, Master Fitton's there too! Shv. All the better! Alm. We may haue a ieere, perhaps. Shv. Yes, you'll drink, Doctor. (If there be any good meat) as much good wine now, As would lay vp a Dutch Ambassador. Tho. If he dine there, he's sure to haue good meat, For, Lickfinger prouides the dinner. Alm. Who? The glory o'the Kitchin? that holds Cookery, A trade from Adam? quotes his broths, and sallads? And sweares he's not dead yet, but translated In some immortall crust, the past of Almonds? Mad. The same. He holds no man can be a Poet, That is not a good Cooke, to know the palats, And seuerall tastes o'the time. He drawes all Arts Out of the Kitchin, but the Art of Poetry, which he concludes the same with Cookery. Shv. Tut, he maintaines more heresies then that. He'll draw the Magisterium from a minc'd-pye, And preferre Iellies, to your Iulips, Doctor. Alm. I was at an Olla Podrida of his making, Was a braue piece of cookery! at a funerall! But opening the pot-lid, he made vs laugh, who had wept all day! and sent vs such a tickling Into out nostrills, as the funerall feast Had bin a wedding-dinner. Shv. Gi'him allowance, And that but moderate, he will make a Syren Sing i'the Kettle, send in an Arion, In a braue broth, and of a watry greene, Iust the Sea-colour, mounted on the backe Of a growne Cunger, but, in such posture, As all the world would take him for a Dolphin. Mad. Hee's a rare fellow, without question! but He holds some Paradoxes. Alm. I, and Pseudodoxes. Mary, for most, he's Orthodox i'the Kitchin. Mad. And knowes the Clergies tast! Alm. I, and the Layties! Shv. You thinke not o' your time, we'll come too late, If we go not presently. Mad. Away then. Shv. Sirs, You must get o'this newes, to store your Office, VVho dines and sups i' the towne? where, and with whom? 'Twill be beneficiall: when you are stor'd; And as we like our fare, we shall reward you. Cla. A hungry trade, 'twill be. Tho. Much like D. Humphries, But, now and then, as th'holesome prouerb saies, 'Twill obsonare famem ambulando. Cla. Shut vp the Office: gentle brother Thomas. Tho. Brother, Nathaniel, I ha' the wine for you. I hope to see vs, one day, Emissaries. Cla. Why not? S'lid, I despaire not to be Master! Scene. IV. Peni-boy. Se. Broker. Cymbal. How now? I thinke I was borne vnder Hercules starre! He is started with Broker's comming back. Nothing but trouble and tumult to oppresse me? Why come you backe? where is your charge? Bro. I ha' brought A Gentleman to speake with you? P. Se. To speake with me? You know 'tis death for me to speake with any man. What is he? set me a chaire. Bro. He's the Master Of the great Office. P. Se. What? Bro. The Staple of Newes, A mighty thing, they talke Six thousand a yeere. P. Se. Well bring your sixe in. Where ha' you left Pecunia? Bro. Sir, in Apollo, they are scarce set. P. Se. Bring sixe. Bro. Here is the Gentleman. P. Se. He must pardon me, I cannot rise, a diseas'd man. Cym. By no meanes, Sir, Respect your health, and ease. P. Se. It is no pride in me! But paine, paine; what's your errand, Sir, to me? Hee sends Broker backe. Broker, returne to your charge, be Argus-eyed, Awake, to the affaire you haue in hand, Serue in Apollo, but take heed of Bacchus. Goe on, Sir. Cym. I am come to speake with you. P. Se. 'Tis paine for me to speake, a very death, But I will heare you! Cym. Sir, you haue a Lady, That soiournes with you. P. Se. Ha? I am somewhat short He pretends infirmity. In my sense too— Cym. Pecunia. P. Se. O' that side, Very imperfect, on— Cym. Whom I would draw Oftner to a poore Office, I am Master of— P. Se. My hearing is very dead, you must speake quicker. Cym. Or, if it please you, Sir, to let her soiourne In part with me; I haue a moyety We will diuide, halfe of the profits. P. Se. Ha? I heare you better now, how come they in? Is it a certaine businesse, or a casuall? For I am loth to seeke out doubtfull courses, Runne any hazardous paths, I loue streight waies, A iust, and vpright man! now all trade totters. The trade of money, is fall'n, two i'the hundred. That was a certaine trade, while th'age was thrifty, And men good husbands, look'd vnto their stockes, Had their mindes bounded; now the publike Riot Prostitutes all, scatters away in coaches, In foot-mens coates, and waiting womens gownes, They must haue veluet hanches (with a pox) Hee talkes vehemently and aloud. Now taken vp, and yet not pay the vse; Bate of the vse? I am mad with this times manners. Cym. You said e'en now, it was death for you to speake. P. Se. I, but an anger, a iust anger, (as this is) Puts life in man. Who can endure to see The fury of mens gullets, and their groines? It mou'd more and more. What fires, what cookes, what kitckins might be spar'd? What Stewes, Ponds, Parks, Coupes, Garners, Magazines? What veluets, tissues, scarfes, embroyderies? And laces they might lacke? They couet things— Superfluous still; when it were much more honour They could want necessary! What need hath Nature Of siluer dishes? or gold chamber-pots? Of perfum'd napkins? or a numerous family, To see her eate? Poore, and wise she, requires Meate onely; Hunger is not ambitious: Say, that you were the Emperour of pleasures, The great Dictator of fashions, for all Europe, And had the pompe of all the Courts, and Kingdomes, Laid forth vnto the shew? to make your selfe Gaz'd, and admir'd at? You must goe to bed, And take your naturall test: then, all this vanisheth. Your brauery was but showen; 'twas not possest: While it did boast it selfe, it was then perishing. Cym. This man has healthfull lungs. P. Se. All that excesse Appear'd as little yours, as the Spectators. It scarce fills vp the expectation Of a few houres, that entertaines mens liues. Cym. He has the monopoly of sole-speaking. He is angry. Why, good Sir? you talke all. P. Se. Why should I not? Is it not vnder mine owne roofe? my feeling? Cym. But I came hete to talk with you. P. S. Why, an' I will not Talke with you, Sir? you are answer'd, who sent for you? Bids him get out of his house, Cym. Nobody sent for me— P. Se. But you came, why then Goe, as you came, heres no man holds you, There, There lies your way, you see the doore. Cym. This's strange! P. Se. 'Tis my ciuility, when I doe not rellish The party, or his businesse. Pray you be gone, Sir. I'll ha' no venter in your Ship, the Office Your Barke of Six, if 'twere sixteene, good, Sir. Cym. You are a rogue. P. Se. I thinke I am Sir, truly. Cymbal railes at him. Cym. A Rascall, and a money-bawd. P. Se. My surnames: Cym. A wretched Rascall! P. S. You will ouerflow— He ieeres him. And spill all. Cym. Caterpiller, moath, Horse-leach, and dung-worme— P. Se. Still you lose your labor. I am a broken vessell, all runnes out: A shrunke old Dryfat. Fare you well, good Sixe. The third Intermeane after the third Act. Censvre. A notable tough Rascall! this old Peny-boy! right City-bred! Mirth. In Siluer-streete, the Region of money, a goodseat for a Vsurer. Tatle. He has rich ingredients in him, I warrant you, if they were extracted, a true receit to make an Alderman, an' he were well wrought vpon, according to Art. Exp. I would faine see an Alderman in chimia! that is a treatise of Aldermanity truely written. Cen. To shew how much it differs from Vrbanity. Mirth. I, or humanity. Either would appeare in this Peny boy, an' hee were rightly distill'd. But how like you the newes? you are gone from that. Cen. O, they are monstrous! scuruy! and stale! and too exotick! ill cook'd! and ill dish'd! Exp. They were as good, yet, as butter could make them! Tat. In a word, they were beastly buttered! he shall neuer come o' my bread more, nor my in mouth, if I can helpe it. I haue had better newes from the bake-house, by ten thousand parts, in a morning: or the conduicts in Westminster! all the newes of Tutle-street, and both the Alm'ries! the two Sanctuaries long, and round Wool-staple! with Kings-street, and Chanon-row to boot! Mirth. I, my Gossip Tatle knew what fine slips grew in Gardinerslane; who kist the Butchers wife with the Cowes-breath; what matches were made in the bowling-Alley, and what bettes wonne and lost; how much grieft went to the Mill and what besides: who coniur'd in Tutlefields, and how many? when they neuer came there. And which Boy rode vpon Doctor Lambe, in the likenesse of a roaring Lyon, that runne away with him in his teeth, and ha's not deuour'd him yet. Tat. Why, I had it from my maid Ioane Heare-say: and shee had it from a limbe o'the schoole, shee saies, a little limbe of nine yeere old; who told her, the Master left out his coniuring booke one day, and hee found it, and so the Fable came about. But whether it were true, or no, we Gossips are bound to beleeue it, an't be once out, and a foot: how should wee entertaine the time else, or finde our selues in fashionable discourse, for all companies, if we do not credit all, and make more of it, in the reporting? Cen. For my part, I beleeue it: and there were no wiser then I, I would haue ne'er a cunning Schoole-Master in England. I meane a Cunning-Man, a Schoole-Master; that is a Coniurour, or a Poet or that had any acquaintance with a Poet. They make all their schollers Play-boyes! Is't not a fine sight, to see all our children made Enterluders? Doe wee pay our money for this? wee send them to learne their Grammar, and their Terence, and they learne their play-books? well, they talke, we shall haue no more Parliaments (God blesse vs) but an' wee haue, I hope, Zeale-of-the-land Buzy, and my Gossip, Rabby Trouble-truth will start vp, and see we shall haue painfull good Ministers to keepe Schoole, and Catechise our youth, and not teach 'hem to speake Playes, and Act Fables of falsenewes, in this manner, to the super-uexation of Towne and Countrey, with a wanion.</field>

Lickfinger is challeng'd by Madrigal of an argument. I hope the fare was good. Pec. Yes, Lickfinger, And we shall thanke you for't and reward you. Mad. Nay, I'll not lose my argument, Lickfinger; Before these Gentlemen, I affirme, The perfect, and true straine of poetry, Is rather to be giuen the quicke Celler, Then the fat Kitchin. Lic. Heretique, I see Thou art for the vaine Oracle of the Botle. The hogshead, Trismegistus, is thy Pegasus. Thence flowes thy Muses spring, from that hard hoofe: Seduced Poet, I doe say to thee, A Boyler, Range, and Dresser were the Fountaines, Of all the knowledge in the vniuerse. And they' are the Kitchins, where the Master-Cooke— (Thou dost not know the man, nor canst thou know him, Till thou hast seru'd some yeeres in that deepe schoole, That's both the Nurse and Mother of the Arts, And hear'st him read, interpret, and demonstrate!) A Master-Cooke! Why, he's the man o' men, For a Professor! he designes, he drawes, He paints, he carues, he builds, he fortifies, Makes Citadels of curious fowle and fish, Some he dri-dishes, some motes round with broths. Mounts marrowbones, cuts fifty angled custards, Reares bulwark pies, and for his outerworkes He raiseth Ramparts of immortall crust; And teacheth all the Tacticks, at one dinner: What Rankes, what Files, to put his dishes in; The whole Art Military. Then he knowes, The influence of the Starres vpon his meats, And all their seasons, tempers, qualities, And so to fit his relishes, and sauces, He has Nature in a pot, 'boue all the Chymists, Or airy brethren of the Rosie-crosse. He is an Architect, an Inginer, A Souldiour, a Physician, a Philosopher, A general Mathematician. Mad. It is granted. Lic. And that you may not doubt him, for a Poet— Alm. This fury shewes, if there were nothing else! And 'tis diuine! I shall for euer hereafter, Admire the wisedome of a Cooke! Ban. And we, Sir! P. Iv. O, how my Princesse drawes me, with her lookes, Peny-boy is courting his Princesse all the while. And hales me in, as eddies draw in boats, Or strong Charybdis ships, that saile too neere The shelues of Loue! The tydes of your two eyes! Wind of your breath, are such as sucke in all, That doe approach you! Pec. Who hath chang'd my seruant? P. Iv. Your selfe, who drinke my blood vp with your beames, As doth the Sunne, the Sea! Pecunia shines More in the world then he: and makes it Spring Where e'r she fauours! 'please her but to show Her melting wrests, or bare her yuorie hands, She catches still! her smiles they are Loue's fetters! Her brests his apples! her teats Stawberries! Where Cupid (were he present now) would cry Fare well my mothers milke, here's sweeter Nectar! Helpe me to praise Pecunia, Gentlemen: She's your Princesse, lend your wits, Fit. A Lady, They all beginne the encomium of Pecunia. The Graces taught to moue! Alm. The Houres did nurse! Fit. Whose lips are the instructions of all Louers! Alm. Her eyes their lights, and riualls to the Starres! Fit. A voyce, as if that Harmony still spake! Alm. And polish'd skinne, whiter then Venus foote! Fit. Young Hebes necke, or Iunoe's armes! Alm. A haire, Large as the Mornings, and her breath as sweete, As meddowes after raine, and but new mowne! Fit. Læda might yeeld vnto her, for a face! Alm. Hermione for brests! Fit. Flora, for cheekes! Alm. And Helen for a mouth! P. Iv. Kisse, kisse 'hem, Princesse. She kisseth them. Fit. The pearle doth striue in whitenesse, with her necke, Alm. But loseth by it: here the Snow thawes Snow; One frost resolues another! Fit. O, she has A front too slippery to be look't vpon! Alm. And glances that beguile the seers eyes! Againe. P. Iv. Kisse, kisse againe, what saies my man o' warre? Shv. I say, she's more, then Fame can promise of her. A Theame, that's ouercome with her owne matter! Praise is strucke blind, and deafe, and dumbe with her! Shee doth astonish Commendation! P. Iv. Well pumpt i'faith old Sailor: kisse him too: She kisseth Captaine Shunfield. Though he be a slugge. What saies my Poet-sucker! He's chewing his Muses cudde, I doe see by him. Mad. I haue almost done, I want but e'ne to finish. Fit. That's the 'ill luck of all his workes still. P. Iv. What? Fit. To beginne many works, but finish none; P. Iv. How does he do his Mistresse work? Fit. Imperfect. Alm. I cannot thinke he finisheth that. P. Iv. Let's heare. Mad. It is a Madrigall, I affect that kind Of Poem, much. P. Iv. And thence you ha' the name. Fit. It is his Rose. He can make nothing else Mad. I made it to the tune the Fidlers play'd, That we all lik'd so well. P. Iv. Good, read it, read it. Mad. The Sunne is father of all mettalls, you know, Siluer, and gold. P. Iv. I, leaue your Prologues, say! SONG. Madrigal. As bright as is the Sunne her Sire, Or Earth her mother, in her best atyre, Or Mint; the Mid-wife, with her fire, Comes forth her Grace! The splendour of the wealthiest Mines! P. Iv. That Mint the Midwife does well. [Mad.] The stamp, and strength of all imperiall lines, Both maiesty and beauty shines, In her sweet face! Fit. That's fairely said of Money. [Mad.] Looke how a Torch, of Taper light, Or of that Torches flame, a Beacon bright; P. Iv. Good! Mad. Now there, I want a line to finish, Sir. P. Iv. Or of that Beacons fire, Moone-light: Fit. 'Tis good. Mad. So take she place! And then I'haue a Saraband— She makes good cheare, she keepes full boards, She holds a Faire of Knights, and Lords, A Mercat of all Offices, And Shops of honour, more or lesse. According to Pecunia's Grace, The Bride vertue, valour, wit, And wisedome, as he stands for it. Pic. Call in the Fidlers. Nicke, the boy shall sing it, Sweet Princesse, kisse him, kisse 'hem all, deare Madame, He vrgeth her to kisse them all. And at the close, vouchsafe to call them Cousins. Pec. Sweet Cousin Madrigall, and Cousin Fitton, My Cousin Shunfield, and my learned Cousin. P. Ca. Al-manach, though they call him Almanack. P. Iv. Why, here's the Prodigall prostitutes his Mistresse! P. Iv. And Picklocke, he must be a kinsman too. My man o' Law will teach vs all to winne, And keepe our owne. Old Founder. P. Ca. Nothing, I Sir? I am a wretch, a begger. She the fortunate. Can want no kindred, wee, the poore know none. Fit. Nor none shall know, by my consent. Alm. Nor mine, P. Iv. Sing, boy, stand here. P. Ca. Look, look, how all their eyes The boy sings the song. Dance i'their heads (obserue) scatter'd with lust! At sight o'their braue Idoll! how they are tickl'd, With a light ayre! the bawdy Saraband! They are a kinde of dancing engines all! And set, by nature, thus, to runne alone To euery sound! All things within, withou them, Moue, but their braine, and that stands still! mere monsters Here, in a chamber, of most subtill feet! And make their legs in tune, passing the streetes! These are the gallant spirits o'the age! The miracles o'the time! that can cry vp And downe mens wits! and set what rate on things Their half-brain'd fancies please! Now pox vpon 'hem. See how solicitously he learnes the Iigge, As if it were a mystery of his faith! Shv. A dainty ditty! Fit. O, hee's a dainty Poet! When he sets to't! P. Iv. And a dainty Scholler! They are all struck with admiration. Alm. No, no great scholler, he writes like a Gentleman. Shv. Pox o'your Scholler. P. Ca. Pox o'your distinction! As if a Scholler were no Gentleman. With these, to write like a Gentleman, will in time Become, all one, as to write like an Asse, These Gentlemen? these Rascalls! I am sicke Of indignation at 'hem. P. Iv. How doe you lik't, Sir? Fit. 'Tis excellent! Alm. 'Twas excellently sung! Fit. A dainty Ayre! P. Iv. What saies my Lickfinger? Lic. I am telling Mistresse Band, and Mistresse Statute, What a braue Gentleman you are, and Waxe, here! How much 'twere better, that my Ladies Grace, Would here take vp Sir, and keepe house with you. P. Iv. What say they? Sta. We could consent, Sr, willingly. Band. I, if we knew her Grace had the least liking. Wax. We must obey her Graces will, and pleasure. P. Iv. I thanke you, Gentlewomen, ply 'hem, Lickfinger. Giue mother Mortgage, there— Lic. Her doze of Sacke. I haue it for her, and her distance of Hum. Pec. Indeede therein, I must confesse, deare Cousin, The Gallants are all about Pecunia. I am a most vnfortunate Princesse. Alm. And You still will be so, when your Grace may helpe it. Mad. Who'ld lie in a roome, with a close-stoole, and garlick? And kennell with his dogges? that had a Prince Like this young Peny-boy, to soiourne with? Shv. He'll let you ha' your liberty— Alm. Goe forth, Whither you please, and to what company— Mad. Scatter your selfe amongst vs— P. Iv. Hope of Pernassus! Thy Iuy shall not wither, nor thy Bayes, Thou shalt be had into her Graces Cellar, And there know Sacke, and Claret, all December, Thy veine is rich, and we must cherish it. Poets and Bees swarme now adaies, but yet There are not those good Tauemes, for the one sort, As there are Flowrie fields to feed the other. Though Bees be pleas'd with dew, aske little Waxe That brings the honey to her Ladyes hiue: The Poet must haue wine. And he shall haue it. Scene. IIJ. Peni-boy. Se. Peny-boy. Iv. Lickfinger. &amp;c. Broker? what Broker? P. Iv. Who's that? my Vncle! P. Se. I am abus'd, where is my Knaue? my Broker? Lic. Your Broker is laid out vpon a bench, yonder, Sacke hath seaz'd on him, in the shape of sleepe. Pic. Hee hath beene dead to vs almost this houre. P. Se. This houre? P. Ca. Why sigh you Sr? 'cause he's at rest? P. Se. It breeds my vnrest. Lic. Will you take a cup He strikes the Sacke out of his hand. And try if you can sleepe? P. Se. No, cogging Iacke, Thou and thy cups too, perish. Shv. O, the Sacke! Mad. The sacke, the sacke! P. Ca. A Madrigall on Sacke! Pic. Or rather an Elegy, for the Sacke is gone. Pec. VVhy doe you this, Sir? spill the wine, and raue? For Brokers sleeping? P. Se. VVhat through sleepe, and Sacke, My trust is wrong'd: but I am still awake, Hee would haue Pecunia home. But shee refuseth. And her Traine. To waite vpon your Grace, please you to quit This strange lewd company, they are not for you. Pec. No Guardian, I doe like them very well. P. Se. Your Graces pleasure be obseru'd, but you Statute, and Band, and Waxe, will goe with me. Sat. Truly we will not. Ban. VVe will stay, and wait here Vpon her Grace, and this your Noble Kinsman. P. Se. Noble? how noble! who hath made him noble? P. Iv. VVhy, my most noble money hath, or shall; My Princesse, here. She that had you but kept, And treated kindly, would haue made you noble, And wise, too: nay, perhaps haue done that for you, An Act of Parliament could not, made you honest. The truth is, Vncle, that her Grace dislikes Her entertainment: specially her lodging. Pec. Nay, say her iaile. Neuer vnfortunate Princesse, Was vs'd so by a Iaylor. Aske my women, Band, you can tell, and Statute, how he has vs'd me, Kept me close prisoner, vnder twenty bolts— Sta. And forty padlocks— Ban. All malicious ingines A wicked Smith could forge out of his yron: As locks, and keyes, shacles, and manacles, To torture a great Lady. Sta. H'has abus'd Your Graces body. Pec. No, he would ha' done, That lay not in his power: he had the vse Of our bodies, Band, and Waxe, and sometimes Statutes: But once he would ha' smother'd me in a chest, And strangl'd me in leather, but that you Came to my rescue, then, and gaue mee ayre. Sta. For which he cramb'd vs vp in a close boxe, All three together, where we saw no Sunne In one sixe moneths. Wax. A cruell man he is! Ban. H'has left my fellow Waxe out, i'the cold, Sta. Till she was stiffe, as any frost, and crumbl'd Away to dust, and almost lost her forme. Wax. Much adoe to recouer me. P. Se. Women Ieerers! Haue you learn'd too, the subtill facultie? Come, I'll shew you the way home, if drinke, Or, too full diet haue disguis'd you. Ban. Troth, We haue not any mind, Sir, of returne— Sta. To be bound back to backe— Ban. And haue our legs Turn'd in, or writh'd about— Wax. Or else display'd— Sta. Be lodg'd with dust and fleas, as we were wont— Ban. And dyeted with dogs dung. P. Se. Why? you whores, My bawds, my instruments, what should I call you, Man may thinke base inough for you? P. Iv. Heare you, vncle. I must not heare this of my Princesse seruants, And in Apollo, in Pecunia's roome, Goe, get you downe the staires: Home, to your Kennell, As swiftly as you can.

VVhen he discourseth of dissection, Or any point of Anatomy: that hee tells you, Of Vena caua, and of vena parta, The Meseraicks, and the Mesenterium. VVhat does hee else but cant? Or if he runne To his Iudiciall Astrologie, And trowle the Trine, the Quartile and the Sextile, Platicke aspect, and Partile, with his Hyleg Or Alchochoden, Cuspes, and Horroscope. Does not he cant?

Who haue done this, to try how you would vse Pecunia, when you had her: which since I see, I will take home the Lady, to my charge, And these her seruants, and leaue you my Cloak, To trauell in to Beggers Bush! A Seate, Is built already, furnish'd too, worth twentie Of your imagin'd structures, Canters Colledge. Fit. 'Tis his Father! Mad. Hee's aliue, me thinks. Alm. I knew he was no Rogue! P. Ca. Thou, Prodigall, Was I so carefull for thee, to procure, And plot wi' my learn'd Counsell, Master Picklocke, This noble match for thee; and dost thou prostitute, Scatter thy Mistresse fauours, throw away Her bounties, as they were red-burning coales, Too hot for thee to handle, on such rascalls? Who are the scumme, and excrements of men? If thou had'st sought out good, and vertuous persons Of these professions: I had lou'd thee, and them, For these shall neuer haue that plea 'gainst me, Or colour of aduantage, that I hate Their callings, but their manners and their vices, A worthy Courtier, is the ornament Of a Kings Palace, his great Masters honour. This is a moth, a rascall, a Court-rat, That gnawes the common-wealth with broking suits, And eating grieuances! So, a true Souldier, He is his Countryes strength, his Soueraignes safety, And to secure his peace, he makes himselfe. The heyre of danger, nay the subiect of it, And runnes those vertuous hazards, that this Scarre-crow Cannot endure to heare of. Shv. You are pleasant, Sir. P. Ca. With you I dare be! Here is Pyed-mantle, 'Cause he's an Asse, doe not I loue a Herald? Who is the pure preseruer of descents, The keeper faire of all Nobility, Without which all would runne into confusion? Were he a learned Herald, I would tell him He can giue Armes, and markes, he cannot honour, No more then money can make Noble: It may Giue place, and ranke, but it can giue no Vertue. And he would thanke me, for this truth. This dog-Leach, You stile him Doctor, 'cause he can compile An Almanack; perhaps erect a Scheme For my great Madams monkey: when 't has ta'ne A glister, and bewrai'd the Ephemerides. Doe I despise a learn'd Physician? In calling him a Quick-Saluer? or blast The euer-liuing ghirlond, alwaies greene Of a good Poet? when I say his wreath Is piec'd and patch'd of dirty withred flowers? Away, I am impatient of these vlcers, (That I not call you worse) There is no sore, Or Plague but you to infect the times. I abhorre Your very scent. Come, Lady, since my Prodigall Knew not to entertaine you to your worth, I'll see if I haue learn'd, how to receiue you, Hee points him to his patch'd cloake throwne off. With more respect to you, and your faire traine here. Farewell my Begger in veluet, for to day, To morrow you may put on that graue Robe, And enter your great worke of Canters Colledge, Your worke and worthy of a Chronicle, The fourth Intermeane after the fourth Act. Tatle. Why? This was the worst of all! the Catastrophe! Cen. The matter began to be good, but now: and he has spoyl'd it all, with his Begger there! Mirt. A beggerly Iacke it is, I warrant him, and a kin to the Poet. Tat. Like enough, for hee bad the chiefest part in his play, if you marke it. Exp. Absurdity on him, for a huge ouergrowne Play-maker! why should he make him liue againe, when they, and we all thought him dead? If he had left him to his ragges, there had beene an end of him. Tat. I, but set a beggar on horse-backe, hee'll neuer linne till hee be a gallop. Cen. The young heyre grew a fine Gentleman, in this last Act! Exp. So he did, Gossip: and kept the best company. Cen. And feasted 'hem, and his Mistresse! Tat. And shew'd her to 'hem all! was not iealous! Mirth. But very communicatiue, and liberall, and beganne to be magnificent, if the churle his father would haue let him alone. Cen. It was spitefully done o' the Poet, to make the Chuffe take him off in his heighth, when he was going to doe all his braue deedes! Exp. To found an Academy! Tat. Erect a Colledge! Exp. Plant his Professors, and water his Lectures. Mirth. With wine, gossips, as he meant to doe, and then to defraud his purposes? Exp. Kill the hopes of so many towardly young spirits? Tat. As the Doctors? Cen. And the Courtiers! I protest, I was in loue with Master Fitton. He did weare all he had, from the hat-band, to the shooe-tye, so politically, and would stoop, and leere? Mirth. And lie so, in waite for a piece of wit, like a Mouse-trap? Exp. Indeed Gossip, so would the little Doctor, all his behauiour was meere glister! O' my conscience, hee would make any parties physicke i' the world worke, with his discourse. Mir. I wonder they would suffer it, a foolish old fornicating Father, to ranish away his sonnes Mistresse. Cen. And all her women, at once, as hee did! Tat. I would ha' flyen in his gypsies faces i' faith. Mirth. It was a plaine piece of politicall incest, and worthy to be brought afore the high Commission of wit. Suppose we were to censure him, you are the youngest voyce, Gossip Tatle, beginne. Tatle. Mary, I would ha' the old conicatcher coozen'd of all he has, i'the young heyres defence, by his learn'd Counsell, Mr Picklocke! Censvre. I would rather the Courtier had found out some tricke to begge him, from his estate! Exp. Or the Captaine had courage enough to beat him. Cen. Or the fine Madrigall-man, in rime, to haue runne him out o' the Countrey, like an Irish rat. Tat. No, I would haue Master Pyed-mantle, her Graces Herald, to pluck downe his hatchments, reuerse his coat-armour, and nullifie him for no Gentleman. Exp. Nay, then let Master Doctor dissect him, haue him open'd, and his tripes translated to Lickfinger, to make a probation dish of. Cen., Tat. Agreed! Agreed! Mirth. Faith I would haue him flat disinherited, by a decree of Court, bound to make restitution of the Lady Pecunia, and the vse of her body to his sonne. Exp. And her traine, to the Gentlemen. Cen. And both the Poet, and himselfe, to aske them all forgiuenesse! Tat. And vs too. Cen. In two large sheetes of paper— Exp. Or to stand in a skin of parchment, (which the Court please) Cen. And those fill'd with newes! Mirth. And dedicated to the sustaining of the Staple! Exp. Which their Poet hath let fall, most abruptly? Mirth. Banckruptly, indeede! Cen. You say wittily, Gossip, and therefore let a protest goe out against him. Mir. A mourniuall of protests; or a gleeke at least! Exp. In all our names: Cen. For a decay'd wit— Exp. Broken— Tat. Non-soluent— Censvre. And, for euer, forfet— Mirth. To scorne, of Mirth? Cen. Censure! Exp. Expectation! Tat. Subsign'd. Tatle, Stay, they come againe.</field>

Nay, they are fit, as they had been made for me, And I am now a thing, worth looking at! The same, I said I would be in the morning. No Rogue, at a Comitia of the Canters, Did euer there become his Parents Robes Better, then I do these: great foole! and begger! Why doe not all that are of those societies, Come forth, and gratulate mee one of theirs? Me thinkes, I should be, on euery side, saluted, Dauphin of beggers! Prince of Prodigalls! That haue so fall'n vnder the eares, and eyes, And tongues of all, the fable o'the time, Matter of scorne, and marke of reprehension! I now begin to see my vanity, Shine in this Glasse, reflected by the foile! Where is my Fashioner? my Feather-man? My Linnener? Perfumer? Barber? all? That tayle of Riot, follow'd me this morning? Not one! but a darke solitude about mee, Worthy my cloake, and patches; as I had The epidemicall disease vpon mee: And I'll sit downe with it. Tho. My Master! Maker! How doe you? Why doe you sit thus o'the ground, Sir? Heare you the newes? P. Iv. No, nor I care to heare none. Would I could here sit still, and slip away The other one and twenty, to haue this Forgotten, and the day rac'd out, expung'd, In euery Ephemerides, or Almanack. Or if it must be in, that Time and Nature Haue decree'd; still, let it be a day Of tickling Prodigalls, about the gills; Deluding gaping heires, loosing their loues, And their discretions; falling from the fauours Of their best friends, and parents; their owne hopes; And entring the society of Canters. Tho. A dolefull day it is, and dismall times Are come vpon vs: I am cleare vndone. P. Iv. How, Thom? Tho. Why? broke! broke! wretchedly broke! P. Iv. Ha! Tho. Our Staple is all to pieces, quite dissolu'd! P. Iv. Ha! Tho. Shiuer'd, as in an earth-quake! heard you not The cracke and ruines? we are all blowne vp! Soone as they heard th'Infanta was got from them, Whom they had so deuoured i'their hopes, To be their Patronesse, and soiourne with 'hem; Our Emissaries, Register, Examiner, Flew into vapor: our graue Gouernour Into a subt'ler ayre; and is return'd (As we doe heare) grand-Captaine of the Ieerers. I, and my fellow melted into butter, And spoyl'd our Inke, and so the Office vanish'd. The last hum that it made, was, that your Father, And Picklocke are fall'n out, the man o' Law. Hee starts vp as this. P. Iv. How? this awakes me from my lethargy. Tho. And a great suite, is like to be betweene 'hem, Picklocke denies the Feosement, and the Trust, (Your Father saies) he made of the whole estate, Vnto him, as respecting his mortalitie, When he first laid this late deuice, to try you. P. Iv. Has Picklock then a trust? Tho. I cannot tell, Picklocke enters. Here comes the worshipfull— Pic. What? my veluet-heyre, Turn'd begger in minde, as robes? P. Iv. You see what case, Your, and my Fathers plots haue brought me to. Pic. Your Fathers, you may say, indeed, not mine. Hee's a hard hearted Gentleman! I am sorie To see his rigid resolution! That any man should so put off affection, And humane nature, to destroy his owne! And triumph in a victory so cruell! He's fall'n out with mee, for being yours, And calls me Knaue, and Traytors to his Trust, Saies he will haue me throwne ouer the Barre— P. Iv. Ha'you deseru'd it? Pic. O, good heauen knowes My conscience, and the silly latitude of it! A narrow minded man! my thoughts doe dwell All in a Lane, or line indeed; No turning, Nor scarce obliquitie in them. I still looke Right forward to th'intent, and scope of that Which he would go from now. P. Iv. Had you a Trust, then? Pic. Sir, I had somewhat, will keepe you still Lord Of all the estate, (if I be honest) as I hope I shall. My tender scrupulous brest Will not permit me see the heyre defrauded, And like an Alyen, thrust out of the blood, The Lawes forbid that I should giue consent, To such a ciuill slaughter of a Sonne. P. Iv. Where is the deed? hast thou it with thee? Pic. No, It is a thing of greater consequence, Then to be borne about in a blacke boxe, Like a Low-countrey vorloffe, or Welsh-briefe. It is at Lickfingers, vnder locke and key. P. Iv. O, fetch it hither. Pic. I haue bid him bring it, That you might see it. P. Iv. Knowes he what brings? Pic. No more then a Gardiners Asse, what roots he carries, P. Iv. I was a sending my Father, like an Asse, A penitent Epistle, but I am glad I did not, now. Pic. Hang him, an austere grape, That has no iuice, but what is veriuice in him. Peny-boy runnes out to fetch his letter. P. Iv. I'll shew you my letter! Pic. Shew me a defiance! If I can now commit Father, and Sonne, And make my profits out of both. Commence A suite with the old man, for his whole state, And goe to Law with the Sonnes credit, vndoe Both, both with their owne money, it were a piece Worthy my night-cap, and the Gowne I weare, A Picklockes name in Law. Where are you Sir? What doe you doe so long? P. Iv. I cannot find Where I haue laid it, but I haue laid it safe. Pic No matter, Sir, trust you vnto my Trust, 'Tis that that shall secure you, an absolute deed! And I confesse, it was in Trust, for you, Lest any thing might haue hapned mortall to him: But there must be a gratitude thought on, And aid, Sir, for the charges of the suite, Which will be great, 'gainst such a mighty man, As is our Father, and a man possest Of so much Land, Pecunia and her friends. I am not able to wage Law with him, Yet must maintaine the thing, as mine owne right, Still for your good, and therefore must be bold To vse your credit for monies. P. Iv. What thou wilt, So wee be safe, and the Trust beare it. Pic. Feare not, 'Tis hee must pay arrerages in the end. Wee'l milke him, and Pecunia, draw their creame downe, Before he get the deed into his hands. My name is Picklocke, but hee'll finde me a Padlocke. Scene. II. Peny-boy. Can. Peny-boy. Iv. Picklock. Tho. Barbar. How now? conferring wi'your learned Counsell, Vpo' the Cheat? Are you o'the plot to coozen mee? P. Iv. What plot? P. Se. Your Counsell knowes there, Mr Picklock, Will you restore the Trust yet? Pic. Sir, take patience. And memory vnto you, and bethinke you, What Trust? where dost appeare? I haue your Deed, Doth your Deed specifie any Trust? Is't not A perfect Act? and absolute in Law? Seal'd and deliuer'd before witnesses? The day and date, emergent. P. Ca. But what conference? What othes, and vowes preceded? Pic. I will tell you, Sir, Since I am vrg'd of those, as I remember, You told me you had got a growen estate, By griping meanes, sinisterly. P. Ca. (How!) Pic. And were Eu'n weary of it; if the parties liued, From whom you had wrested it— P. Ca. (Ha!) Pic. You could be glad, To part with all, for satisfaction: But since they had yeelded to humanity, And that iust heauen had sent you, for a punishment (You did acknowledge it) this riotous heyre, That would bring all to beggery in the end, And daily sow'd consumption, where he went— P. Ca. You old coozen both, then? your Confederate, too? Pic. After a long, mature deliberation, You could not thinke, where, better, how to place it— P. Ca. Then on you, Rascall? Pic. What you please i'your passion, But with your reason, you will come about And thinke a faithfull, and a frugall friend To be preferr'd. P. Ca. Before a Sonne? Pic. A Prodigall, A tubbe without a bottome, as you term'd him; For which, I might returne you a vow, or two, And seale it with an oath of thankfulnesse, I not repent it, neither haue I cause, Yet— P. Ca. Fore-head of steele, and mouth of brasse! hath impudence Polish'd so grosse a lie, and dar'st thou vent it? Engine, compos'd of all mixt mettalls! hence, I will not change a syllab, with thee, more, Till I may meet thee, at a Barre in Court, Before thy Iudges. Pic. Thither it must come, His Son entreats him. Before I part with it, to you, or you, Sir. P. Ca. I will not heare thee. P. Iv. Sir, your eare to mee, though. Not that I see through his perplexed plots, And hidden ends, nor that my parts depend Vpon the vnwinding this so knotted skeane, Doe I beseech your patience. Vnto mee He hath confest the trust. Pic. How? I confesse it? P. Iv. I thou, false man. P. Se. Stand vp to him, &amp; confront him. Pic. Where? when? to whom? P. Iv. To me, euen now, and here, Canst thou deny it? Pic. Can I eate, or drinke? Sleepe, wake, or dreame? arise, sit, goe, or stand? Doe any thing that's naturall? P. Iv. Yes, lye: It seemes thou canst, and periure: that is naturall! Pic. O me! what time are these! of frontlesse carriage! An Egge o'the same nest! the Fathers Bird! It runs in a blood, I see! P. Iv. I'll stop your mouth. Pic. With what? P. Iv. With truth. Pic. With noise, I must haue witnes. Where is your witnes? you can produce witnes? P. Iv. As if my testimony were not twenty, Balanc'd with thine? Pic. So say all Prodigalls, Sicke of selfe-loue, but that's not Law, young Scatter-good. I liue by Law. P. Iv. Why? if thou hast a conscience, That is a thoussnd witnesses. Pic. No, Court, Grants out a Writ of Summons, for the Conscience, That I know, nor Sub-pæna, nor Attachment. I must haue witnesse, and of your producing, Ere this can come to hearing, and it must Hee produceth Thom. Be heard on oath, and witnesse. P. Iv. Come forth, Thom, Speake what thou heard'st, the truth, and the whole truth, And nothing but the truth. What said this varlet? Pic. A rat behind the hangings! Tho. Sir, he said It was a Trust! an Act, the which your Father Had will to alter: but his tender brest Would not permit to see the heyre defrauded; And like an alyen, thrust out of the blood. The Lawes forbid that he should giue consent To such a ciuill slaughter of a Sonne— P. Iv. And talk'd of a gratuitie to be giuen, And ayd vnto the charges of the suite; Which he was to maintaine, in his owne name, But for my vse, he said. P. Ca. It is enough. Tho. And he would milke Pecunia, and draw downe Her creame, before you got the Trust, againe. P. Ca. Your eares are in my pocket, Knaue, goe shake 'hem, The little while you haue them. Pic. You doe trust To your great purse. P. Ca. I ha' you in a purse-net, Good Master Picklocke, wi' your worming braine, And wrigling ingine-head of maintenance, Which I shall see you hole with, very shortly. A fine round head, when those two lugs are off, To trundle through a Pillory. You are sure You heard him speake this? P. Iv. I, and more. Tho. Much more! Pic. I'll proue yours maintenance, and combination, And sue you all. P. Ca. Doe, doe, my gowned Vulture, Crop in Reuersion: I shall see you coyted Ouer the Barre, as Barge-men doe their billets. Pic. This 'tis, when men repent of their good deeds, And would ha'hem in againe—They are almost mad! But I forgiue their Lucida Interualla. O, Lickfinger? come hither. Where's my writing? Pick-lock spies Lickfinger, and askes him aside for the writing. Scene. III. Lickfinger. (to them. I sent it you, together with your keyes, Pic. How? Lic. By the Porter, that came for it, from you, And by the token, you had giu'n me the keyes, And bad me bring it. Pic. And why did you not? Lic. Why did you send a counter-mand? Pic. Who, I? Lic. You, or some other you, you put in trust. Pic. In trust? Lic. Your Trust's another selfe, you know, And without Trust, and your Trust, how should he Take notice of your keyes, or of my charge. Pic. Know you the man? Lic. I know he was a Porter, And a seal'd Porter for he bore the badge On brest, I am sure. Pic. I am lost! a plot! I sent it! Lic. Why! and I sent it by the man you sent Picklocke goes out. Whom else, I had not trusted. Pic. Plague o your trust. I am truss'd vp among you. P. Iv. Or you may be. Pic. In mine owne halter, I haue made the Noose. Young Peny-boy discouers it, to his Father to be his plot of sending for it by the Porter, and that hee is in possession of the Deed. P. Iv. What was it, Lickfinger? Lic. A writing, Sir, He sent for't by a token, I was bringing it: But that he sent a Porter, and hee seem'd A man of decent carriage. P. Ca. 'Twas good fortune! To cheat the Cheater, was no cheat, but iustice, Put off your ragges, and be your selfe againe, This Act of piety, and good affection, Hath partly reconcil'd me to you. P. Iv. Sir. P. C. No vowes, no promises: too much protestation Makes that suspected oft, we would perswade. Lic. Heare you the Newes? P. Iv. The Office is downe, how should we? Lic. But of your vncle? P. Iv. No. Lic. He's runne mad, Sir. P. Ca. How, Lickfinger? Elder Peny-boy startles at the newes. Lic. Stark staring mad, your brother, H'has almost kill'd his maid. P. Ca. Now, heauen forbid. Lic. But that she's Cat-liu'd, and Squirrill-limb'd, With throwing bed-staues at her: h'has set wide His outer doores, and now keepes open house, For all the passers by to see his iustice: First, he has apprehended his two dogges, As being o'the plot to coozen him: And there hee sits like an old worme of the peace, Wrap'd vp in furres at a square table, screwing, Examining, and committing the poore curres, To two old cases of close stooles, as prisons; The one of which, he calls his Lollard's tower, Th'other his Blocke-house, 'cause his two dogs names Are Blocke, and Lollard. P. Iv. This would be braue matter Vnto the Ieerers. P. Ca. I, If so the subiect Were not so wretched. Lic. Sure, I met them all, I thinke, vpon that quest. P. Ca. 'Faith, like enough: The vicious still are swift to shew their natures. I'll thither too, but with another ayme, If all succeed well, and my simples take. Scene IIIJ. He is seene sitting at his Table with papers before him. Peni-boy. Sen. Porter. Where are the prisoners? Por. They are forth-comming, Sr, Or comming forth at least. P. Se. The Rogue is drunke, Since I committed them to his charge. Come hither, Hee smells him. Neere me, yet neerer; breath vpon me. Wine! Wine, o'my worship! sacke! Canary sacke! Could not your Badge ha'bin drunke with fulsome Ale? Or Beere? the Porters element? but sacke! Por. I am not drunke, we had, Sir, but one pynt, An honest carrier, and my selfe. P. Se. Who paid for't? Por. Sir, I did giue it him. P. Se. What? and spend sixpence! A Frocke spend sixpence! sixpence! Por. Once in a yeere, Sir, P. Se. In seuen yeers, varlet! Know'st thou what thou hast done? What a consumption thou hast made of a State? It might please heauen, (a lusty Knaue and young) To let thee liue some seuenty yeeres longer, Till thou art fourescore, and ten; perhaps, a hundred. Say seuenty yeeres; how many times seuen in seuenty? Why, seuen times ten, is ten times seuen, marke me, I will demonstrate to thee on my fingers, Six-pence in seuen yeere (vse vpon vse) Growes in that first seuen yeere, to be a twelue-pence. That, in the next, two-shillings; the third foure-shillings; The fourth seuen yeere, eight-shillings; the fifth, sixteen: The sixth, two and thirty; the seuenth, three-pound foure, The eighth, sixe pound, and eyght; the ninth, twelue pound sixteen; And the tenth seuen, fiue and twenty pound, Twelue Shillings. This thou art fall'n from, by thy riot! Should'st thou liue seuenty yeeres, by spending six-pence, Once i'the seuen: but in a day to wast it! There is a Summe that number cannot reach! Out o'my house, thou pest o' prodigality! Seed o'consumption! hence, a wicked keeper Is oft worse then the prisoners. There's thy penny, Foure tokens for thee. Out, away. My dogges, May yet be innocent, and honest. If not, I haue an entrapping question, or two more, To put vnto 'hem, a crosse Intergatory, And I shall catch 'hem; Lollard? Peace, Hee calls forth Lollard, and examines him. What whispring was that you had with Mortgage, When you last lick'd her feet? The truth now. Ha? Did you smell shee was going? Put downe that. And not, Not to returne? You are silent. good. And, when Leap'd you on Statute? As she went forth? Consent. There was Consent, as shee was going forth. He commits him againe. 'Twould haue beene fitter at her comming home, But you knew that she would not? To your Tower, You are cunning, are you? I will meet your craft. Calls forth Blocke, and examines him. Blocke, shew your face, leaue your caresses, tell me, And tell me truly, what affronts do you know Were done Pecunia? that she left my house? None, say you so? not that you know? or will know? I feare me, I shall find you an obstinate Curre. Why, did your fellow Lollard cry this morning? 'Cause Broker kickt him? why did Broker kicke him? Because he pist against my Ladies Gowne? Why, that was no affront? no? no distast? Commits him. You knew o'none. Yo'are a dissembling Tyke, To your hole, againe, your Blocke-house. Lollard, arise, Where did you lift your legge vp, last? 'gainst what? Lollard is call'd again. Are you struck Dummerer now? and whine for mercy? Whose Kittle was't, you gnaw'd too? Mistresse Bands? And Waxe's stockings? who did? Blocke bescumber Statues white suite? wi' the parchment lace there? And Brokers Sattin dublet? all will out. They had offence, offence enough to quit mee. Blocke is s?mon'd the second time. Appeare Blocke, fough, 'tis manifest. He shewes it, Should he for-sweare't, make all the Affadauits, Against it, that he could afore the Bench, And twenty Iuries; hee would be conuinc'd. Hee is remanded. He beares an ayre about him, doth confesse it! To prison againe, close prison. Not you Lollard, You may enioy the liberty o'the house, Lollard has the liberty of the house. And yet there is a quirke come in my head, For which I must commit you too, and close, Doe not repine, it will be better for you. Enter the Ieerers. Scene II. Cymbal. Fitton. Shvnfield. Almanach.

But such as will not keepe your Capitol? Shv. You were wont to ha'your Breams— Alm. And Trouts sent in? Cym. Fat Carps, and Salmons? Fit. Land now, and then, An Embleme, o'your selfe, an o're-growne Pyke? P. Se. You are a Iack, Sir. Fit. You ha' made a shift To swallow twenty such poore Iacks ere now. Alm.

Peny-Boy. Ca. Peny-boy. Se. Peni-boy. Iv. Pecvnia. Traine. You see by this amazement, and distraction, What your companions were, a poore, affrighted, And guilty race of men, that dare to stand No breath of truth: but conscious to themselues Of their no-wit, or honesty, ranne routed At euery Pannicke terror themselues bred. Where else, as confident as sounding brasse, Their tinckling Captaine, Cymbal, and the rest, Dare put on any visor, to deride The wretched: or with buffon licence, ieast At whatsoe'r is serious, if not sacred. Peny-boy Se. acknowledgeth his elder brother. P. Se. Who's this? my brother! and restor'd to life! P. Ca. Yes, and sent hither to restore your wits: If your short madnesse, be not more then anger, Conceiued for your losse! which I returne you. See here, your Mortgage, Statute, Band, and Waxe, Without your Broker, come to abide with you: And vindicate the Prodigall, from stealing Away the Lady. Nay, Pecunia her selfe, Is come to free him fairely, and discharge All ties, but those of Love, vnto her person, To vse her like a friend, not like a slaue, Or like an Idoll. Superstition Doth violate the Deity it worships: No lesse then scorne doth. And beleeue it, brother The vse of things is all, and not the Store; Surfet, and fulnesse, haue kill'd more then famine. The Sparrow, with his little plumage, flyes, While the proud Peacocke, ouer-charg'd with pennes, Is faine to sweepe the ground, with his growne traine, And load of feathers. P. Se. Wise, and honour'd brother! None but a Brother, and sent from the dead, As you are to me, could haue altered me: I thanke my Destiny, that is so gracious. Are there no paines, no Penalties decreed From whence you come, to vs that smother money, In chests, and strangle her in bagges. P. Ca. O, mighty, Intolerable fines, and mulcts impos'd! (Of which I come to warne you) forfeitures Of whole estates, if they be knowne, and taken! P. Se. I thanke you Brother for the light you haue giuen mee, I will preuent 'hem all. First free my dogges, Lest what I ha' done to them (and against Law) Be a Premuniri, for by Magna Charta They could not be committed, as close prisoners, My learned Counsell tells me here, my Cooke. And yet he shew'd me, the way, first. Lic. Who did? I? I trench the liberty o' the subiects? P. Ca. Peace, Picklocke, your Ghest, that Stentor, hath infected you, Whom I haue safe enough in a wooden collar. P. Se. Next, I restore these seruants to their Ladie, With freedome, heart of cheare, and countenance; It is their yeere, and day of Iubilee. Tra. We thanke you, Sir. P. Se. And lastly, to my Nephew, I giue my house, goods, lands, all but my vices, Her Traine thanks him. And those I goe to cleanse; kissing this Lady Whom I doe giue him too, and ioyne their hands. P. Ca. If the Spectators will ioyne theirs, wee thanke 'hem. P. Iv. And with they may, as I, enjoy Pecunia. Pec. And so Pecunia her selfe doth wish, That shee may still be ayde vnto their vses, Not slaue vnto their pleasures, or a Tyrant Ouer their faire desires; but teach them all The golden meane: the Prodigall how to liue, The sordid, and the couetous, how to dye, That with sound mind; this safe frugality. THE END.</field>

Thus haue you seene the Makers double scope, To profit, and delight; wherein our hope Is, though the clout we doe not alwaies bit, It will not be imputed to his wit: A Tree so tri'd, and bent, as 'twill not start. Nor doth he often cracke a string of Art, Though there may other accidents as strange Happen, the weather of your lookes may change, Or some high wind of mis-conceit arise, To cause an alteration in our Skyes; If so, we'are sorry that haue so mis-spent Our Time and Tackle, yet he'is confident, And vow's the next faire day, hee'll haue vs shoot The same match o're for him, if you'll come to't.</field>
