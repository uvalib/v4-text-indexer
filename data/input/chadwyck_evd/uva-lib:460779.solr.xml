How St. George took the liberty of giving freedom to the other Six Champions, and how they all departed on their several adventures. Kalyba's Band, Guard, Household, &amp;c. AN OASIS IN THE DESERT. The Adventures of St. Denis and St. James. How St. Denis of France, after taking French leave of his Companions, was changed into a Stag and back again; and how St. James of Spain, after killing a great Boar, had a narrow escape of being bored to death himself. How St. Denis released the Daughter of the King of Thessaly, and how St. James would have run away with the Daughter of the Caliph of Jerusalem. HALL IN THE GIANT'S CASTLE.

SIX WILD MEN. O'Whack, O'Rack, O'Rint, O'Tool, O'Bother, O'Murther. The story says 30, but the idea of 30 Wild Men in Ireland is too preposterous even for an Extravaganza. THE ENCHANTED GARDEN of ORMANDINE. The Adventure of St. David. How St. David of Wales essayed the adventure of the Magic Sword, called “Cheese-toaster,” and fell asleep over it; and how, after many adventures which are left to the imagination of the Audience, St. George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick came to the Enchanted Garden of Ormandine, and caught the other Knights napping.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene First. —The Brazen Castle of the Enchantress Kalyba. Enter the Demoniac Household and Guards of the Enchantress, and lastly Kalyba. Chorus —March in “La Tentation.” March—march—march! Hither come all who take Kalyba's wages! Cloven foot guards and infernal young pages. Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily march! Blow your long horns And make your serpents clamorous—clamorous! Batter your drums And flourish your cymbals so gay! Spite of her scorns Of Kalyba still amorous, amorous! Ormandine comes! In state, a kind visit to pay! Ormandine enters in a car drawn by Fiery Dragons. Kal. Welcome, great Ormandine! and say, what is it Procures us, sir, the honour of this visit? Seek you to solve some problem in our art, Or such assistance as I can impart? Or finding you had half-an-hour to spare, Did you drive hither, just for change of air? Orman. The potent Kalyba is far too wise To ask such questions, and require replies. She knows the motive of my coming well, And what events the hostile stars foretell; Or else the scandal's true that I have heard, And love has made her blind! Kal. Love! How absurd! What will the idle gossips whisper next? No—for your visit this is a pretext, By jealousy inspired—come, disgorge Your spleen in two words. Orman. So I will—St. George! Kal. Of course; if cause so plain I could not see, Accounted blind I should deserve to be! And now, supposing all you've heard be true, Permit me to inquire—what's that to you? Orman. Ungrateful Kalyba! what is't to me? Think'st thou, unmoved, thy ruin I could see? Is it not written in the starry skies That Seven Champions shall in Europe rise, Whose valiant deeds shall sweep the earth of evil, And one of them play, with yourself, the devil? Kal. It is—and need I tell you what I've done? Have I not kidnapped every mother's son? Did I not from their cradles have them caught up, And here in solitary dungeons brought up, Spell-bound, their weary lives away to pass, In chains of adamant and walls of brass? Orman. Save one—who roams within your castle free— Kal. Within, I grant; but still my captive he, As fast as either of the other six. Orman. No, you are his—and in an awkward fix, You'll find yourself, as sure as you stand there, If of that deep young dog you don't take care! Kal. Fear not—such care of him I mean to take, That you shall not a victim of him make. So, from your double face pull off the vizard, And stand confessed, a jealous-pated wizard! Who hates, because I love the beauteous boy, And would your rival, not my foe, destroy. Orman. I tell you danger in the stars I've read— Kal. Add to your information, “Queen Anne's dead!” Trot back to Tartary, most sage Manchoo, Such is my counsel, in return to you. I'm truly grateful for your friendly warning, And wish you—very heartily—good morning! Orman. Farewell, for ever, Kalyba! I see You'll catch a Tartar, but 'twill not be me! (music—Exeunt Ormandine, Guards, &amp;c.) Kal. No doubt he meant that speech to be pathetic. That Tartar is, to me, tartar emetic! Let him once more but dare to interfere, And I will send him off with, in his ear, The most gigantic flea that ever skipped, Or, like a syllabub, may I be whipped! Now to refresh my spirits with the sight Of my young hero, who so longs to fight; I must for him a box of soldiers find, To pitch into, whenever he's inclined. (uproar without) Heyday! who's kicking up that dreadful row? Somebody's pitching into some one now! Speak! who is being pounded in a mortar? Page. It's Master George, madam, punching the porter! Kal. The porter! what, a giant? Page. He don't care— He'd punch Old Nick himself, if he were there! (Giant looks over the wall, crying) Giant, Ow! If you please I won't stop in my place, If that young scamp's to go it at this pace, Because I said the gate he mustn't pass, He up and called me a great stupid ass. And when I tried to push him back, ecod, he Knocked almost all the breath out of my body. (cries) Kal. (aside) The brave young rogue! Well, there, don't make that noise! The lad has spirit, and boys will be boys! But 'twasn't pretty of him, I admit— Go back, sir, to your lodge—I'll see to it! Giant. Mind, ma'am, if you can't make him more compliant, You'll please to find yourself another giant. Kal. Begone! (Exit Giant, grumbling) One would suppose, to hear that sot, There was no other giant to be got! I know of twenty, taller, stouter, near To whom that porter would but seem small beer! Tell Master George to come to me. Enter St. George. St. Geo. Behold him. Kal. What eyes he has—I've not the heart to scold him. St. Geo. Now, what d'ye want me for? Kal. One moment, dear— My pet is too impetuous, I fear— You've struck my porter— St. Geo. Well, then, why did he Prevent my going out, the world to see? Kal. He had my orders, love, and did his duty. St. Geo. I don't care! see if I don't spoil his beauty. Just let him wait till I grow up, that's all, And won't I serve him out! Kal. You'll make me call My spirits up, to bind you over, boy, To keep the peace, St. Geo. Your spirits I'll destroy, War, war, no peace! I'll be a soldier— Kal. Stay— St. Geo. St. George for England! forward! charge! hooray! Kal. Be a good boy, and Kalyba but stay with, And you shall have a sword and shield to play with. St. Geo. A helmet too? Kal. A beautiful and bright one. St. Geo. With crimson feathers—I won't shew a white one! Kal. Enter my armoury—choose what you will. (aside) Arm'd, I've no doubt, he'll look more killing still. (waves her wand—The gates at back open and discover the armoury) St. Geo. Oh, what a jolly lot of swords and lances, And all the things one reads of in romances; Here is a suit, that seems just made to suit me! Kal. (aside) And you're a beau Love made I'm sure to shoot me! Without my leave, he's with my heart levanted, The witch bewitched, th'enchantress quite enchanted. (aloud to him) Too captivating captive, I surrender At indiscretion. Lo, to thee I tender My magic wand—use all its wondrous powers, Reign paramount within these brazen towers, Let pleasure hold here a perpetual orgie, For Kalyba, and her sweet Georgy Porgy! St. Geo. Insidious sorceress, against your charms I'm armed in proof, though a mere child in arms! For noble deeds ordained, a youth precocious, Long have I marked, and loathed your wiles atrocious! First will I use my power to set free My six companions in captivity. Equipped for battle, gallant friends, appear. (waves wand—Flourish—Enter the other Six Champions in complete armour) Kal. Furies and fire, I've made a blunder here! Give me my wand again, vile traitor! St. Geo. Never! You've cut this wicked stick of yours for ever, And so will I, as soon as I have done with it! But first I'll have a famous bit of fun with it. Your hour has come, and I know what's o'clock; Thus to their base I make your turrets rock! (the Castle changes to rocks—St. George touches a portion and a chasm appears) Between us, you'll observe, there is a split; Do me the favour to walk into it. You ne'er meant these good knights should see the day! Good night to you, ma'am; turnabout's fair play! Kalyba enters the rock, which closes on her. So that account is closed! (to St. Patrick) My brave young Paddy, Your hand! (to St. Andrew) and yours, my bonnie Highland laddie, (to St. David) My dauntless David, and my trusty Tony, (to St. James) My Spanish don, (to St. Denis) and my gay Gallic crony, Your hands! May all our nations thus be found, Link'd in true friendship, whilst the world goes round. But come, there's business for us all to do; And more, perhaps, than we can well get through. There never was a time when gallant knights Were more required to set the world to rights! Monsters of all sorts are abroad, in heaps, From monster meetings down to monster sweeps— Giant oppressors upon foreign shores, Horrible brutes, and most prodigious bores, Rapacious harpies, who on minors prey, Syrens, who sing the souls of men away! Fatal delusions, moral and political, That vex the Globe, and make the Times more critical. Go forth, then, Champions, over land and water, Defend the right, and give the wrong no quarter! Air—St. George—“Lucia di Lammermoor.” Through the world be your bright swords gleaming, And your standards proudly streaming, Fast before your wrath shall vanish All the snares that man betray. Of ambition the wild frenzy curbing, Dark sedition's plans disturbing; Quacks expose and traitors banish! Truth to conquest points the way, Combat and conquer—come is the day! Each to his task, and be renowned in story! St. George for England, to increase her glory! (Exit) St. And. Andrew for Scotland, to swell her Exchequer! (Exit) St. Dav. David for Wales—to look after Rebecca! The outrages committed in Wales under that name commenced in October, 1848. (Exit) St. Den. Denis for France—who's had some awkward rubs, From the wild men, who sway terrific clubs. Revolution, 1848. See note to “King of the Peacocks.” (Exit) St. Ant. And Anthony for Italy—I hope To find some Romans left, if not a Pope! Insurrection in Italy, then breaking out. (Exit) St. James. St. James for Spain—intriguers vile to banish, Spaniards who feel for nothing but the Spanish! i. e. Money. (Exit) St. Pat. St. Patrick then for Ireland, I suppose, But what's to be done with it—Heaven knows! (Exit) Scene Second. —An Oasis in the Deserts of Arabia—In the centre a mulberry tree. Enter St. Denis. St. Den. Well may they call this Araby the blest! I've found, as yet, no wrong to be redrest. Soft! here comes one in such a shabby weed, He wants redressing very much indeed! Enter Aile-de-Pigeon. Who are you, friend, your name and station—say? Aile. Aile-de-Pigeon, from Paris—Perruquier. St. Den. A perruquier! what brought you to a nation Where wigs are never worn? Aile. Fraternization. I sailed from Marseilles with a bold crusader, Of whom I knew no more than Abdel Kader. But I had money—he had not a sous, And so 'twas settled I should pay for two. St. Den. And what was he to do for you in turn? Aile. Why, that exactly I could never learn, Whilst the cash lasted. St. Den. And when that was flown? Aile. He had flown too—and so I've never known. St. Den. Pauvre Pigeon! and these rags which I view— Aile. Are his old clothes; he took mine which were new. St. Den. Take both your money and your clothes—the thief! Aile. Pardonnez moi—the crime in his belief Was mine—all property is counted theft. No man's all right till he has nothing left. St. Den. Is this the new philosophy of France? Against it will St. Denis break a lance! Aile-de-Pigeon, your champion here you see. From Paris, you must sure know St. Denis! Aile. St. Denis! Sir, of you I've often read, But always thought till now, you wore your head Beneath your arm. St. Den. An image merely, friend, To shew you must not on your head depend In countries where, to speak without a scoff, It's one day heads up and the next, heads off! But come, if to take service you've a mind I want a squire— Aile. Sir, you're very kind. I'm tired of equality, and so Jump at proposals, made so apropos! St. Den. I'll get you into better habits soon. But I have travelled far this afternoon And need some slight refreshment and repose; Yon branches proffer shade, and food disclose. Gather me some of that rich tempting fruit, The whilst I make a pillow of the root. Music—Aile-de-Pigeon gathers some mulberries as St. Denis seats himself under the tree—Aile-de-Pigeon hands him down some of the fruit, but the instant St. Denis has tasted it, he disappears, and a Stag is seen in his place. Aile. (retreating hastily from the tree) Miséricorde! what dreadful change is here? Oh, my dear lord! now more than ever dear! Since in a deer-skin you have wrapped your woes, And tears run trickling down your poor dear nose. What vile magician has thus changed your features And made you take up a four-footed creature's? Air—Aile-de-Pigeon—“Maitre Corbeau.” That such a beau! such a buck, I should say! A greater buck than ever should become to-day, And just as he began to “parler bon Français,” Be turned into a dumb brute who nothing can say; Not even tra, la, la, la, &amp;c. And yet I don't know why I astonishment should show At any turn, however sudden, here below, For after all the changes in Paris I've heard ring There's nothing mightn't turn out in less time than you could sing The air of tra, la, la, &amp;c. Voice . (from tree) Listen! Aile. Ha! listen! Well, I do. Who spoke? Voice. The tree! Aile. The tree! come, that is a good joke! It's some one locked up in a trunk. Voice. You're right! A vile enchanter did it out of spite; But lose no time! Go find a rose, and make Your master eat it, and the spell will break. Aile. A rose! I'll never rest till one I find! (hunting horns in the distance) But hark! the hunter's horns are on the wind! Oh, quickly hide your horns, my dearest master, Or I foresee some terrible disaster. Voice. Go seek the rose, and leave the deer to me, My boughs are bent on sheltering him, you see. (the boughs of the tree gradually droop over the Stag and conceal him) Aile. Sensitive plant, you are a friend in season, I'll trust your leaves, although your fruit is trees-on. (Exit) Enter Katchim and Huntsmen. Chorus —“Guillaume Tell.” We all went out a hunting, The break of day before, In hopes to stop the grunting Of a most enormous boar! Tantarara—tantarara! But he made it soon appear— Tantarara—tantarara! We'd got the wrong pig by the ear— Till a young knight To our delight Into his spare rib poked a spear! Enter Slaves, Art-i-Chok, and Zuliemah in a litter or palanquin. Katchim. Commander of the Faithful, mighty Caliph, Your servants hope for ever that you may live, And they to see you— Art. Speak Katchim. Great sir, without Your leave, I dare not. Art. Get on, or get out! Katchim. The orders of my Sovereign are fulfilled. The boar that bothered us so long is killed! Art. By whom? Katchim. A stranger knight, who came incog., And went against him—the entire hog. Art. Set him immediately our face before! Katchim. Dread Sovereign, which—the stranger or the boar? Art. Both, for each might be both— Katchim. Approach! Music—enter Arabs, bearing the head of a gigantic Boar, and followed by St. James. Katchim. Behold, O King! the trophy and the victor bold! To be rewarded handsomely he claims. Art. What art thou? St. James. Caliph, I am called St. James, Champion of Spain. Art. By Mahomet's grandmother, He is an infidel! St. James. You are another! The deed is done, and I demand the prize! Art. Seize him, and bind him to yon tree—he dies! (they obey) St. James. I've killed a great boar, but this is a greater! Is this your gratitude, you pagan traitor? Art. For the short time you'll draw it, spare your breath! We'll grant one favour—you may choose your death! St. James. Then by a maiden's hand let me be shot! Katchim, How very sentimental, is it not? Art. Agreed! And fortunately here's our daughter; She's a toxopholite of the first water! Zuliemah, darling, take your bow and arrow, And shoot him as you would a young cock-sparrow! Zulie. Alas, dear father, see, my arm's not steady, For he has shot me through the heart already! Oh, pardon him, or see your daughter fall On her own dart! (suiting the action to the word) Art. Stop! that won't do at all. Zulie. Between your vengeance and your daughter choose! Art. Oh, my paternal fondness you abuse! Release the infidel, and let him go. (he is unbound) St. James. (to Zuliemah) To you I dedicate the life I owe. Art. That dedication is not by permission! Hence, of your life take off this new edition. March! (Exeunt Art-i-Chok, Zuliemah, and Suite) St. James. Cruel fate! He takes my life away In taking her with whom for life I'd stay. Air—St. James—“Isabelle.” Oft have I pondered on Peris and Houries, The stars of Arabian Nights, But this fair Pagan more beautiful sure is, Than any such false “Harem Lights.” No gazelle! no gazelle! no gazelle Has such eyes, as of me took the measure! She's a belle! she's a belle! she's a belle I could ring with the greatest of pleasure, Zuliemah! Zuliemah! Enter Leporello. Lep Señor! St. James. Ha! Lep. May you live a thousand years! My mistress, Zuliemah, 'twixt hopes and fears, Sends you these flowers, which in their orthography Mean, she will fly with you through all geography, Cutting the Koran, as she cuts her tether, And so embrace your faith and you together! St. James. Delicious flowers, back to that fairer flower, And beg she'll name the day, and fix the hour! First at St. James's Church we'll tie the knot, Then off to Spain, as fast as we can trot. Lep. To Spain! Oh, St. Jago! St. James. Hold, good fellow. Are you a Spaniard? Lep. Sir, I'm Leporello. St. James. How, Leporello! What, the very zany Who lived some time ago with Don Giovanni! What wind has blown you, pray, so far from Seville? Lep. Why, when my master, sir, went to the devil, I can't say that I felt inclined to follow him. So, soon as I had seen the trap-door swallow him, I bolted, and to Barbary went over. St. James. What made you to that barbarous land a rover? Lep. Alas, señor, in many things to me, Spain seems more barbarous than Barbary. Kept by her own flies in perpetual blister, By turns Christino, Carlist, Progresista; Whilst liberty in strong convulsions lingers, Monarchs make matches, but to burn their fingers; With fluctuating funds, and constant fetters, Mock patriots and bona-fide debtors, 'Tis hard to say who've most care on their shoulders, Those held in bonds, or those who are bond holders. St. James. Castile is famed for honour still, I hope? Lep. Castile, at present, is more famed for soap. St. James. Fine tempered blades Toledo still displays? Lep. They're not quite so good-tempered now-a-days. St. James. Poor Spain, a champion yet from wreck may save her, But first to liberate my fair enslaver! Lep. Leave me alone for that, good señor mine, I've had some practice in the eloping line; I'll aid her to decamp from watch and warders, And be your aide-de-camp till further orders. Duo—St. James and Leporello—“Giovinetti.” Then/I'll away to the lady and say 'tis my/your glory To bear her from her Saracen pa, “As the bul-bul is true to the rose” the old story, old story, You/I can say to her—et cetera, et cetera, That we'll start by the next ship will sail if The start we can get of the Caliph, And happy to be I/you can't fail if Beloved by the fair Zuliemah, Zuliemah! (Exit Leporello) Enter Aile-de-Pigeon. Aile. I've beaten every bush to find a rose; Not e'en a dog's one in the desert grows! Wonder of wonders! who is this I see? My master retransformed—great St. Denis. St. James. St. Denis! no, I am St. James of Spain. What know you of my friend in arms?—explain. Aile. Oh, sir, to save him, you by fate are sent, sure! He's had the most remarkable adventure! He took a fancy to some ripe mulberries, But they turned out to be vile black-art cherries. Changed to a stag, behold the gallant knight! (parting the boughs and shewing the Stag) St. James. I'm absolutely staggered at the sight! What can restore his blood to circulation, In human form, from this state of stagnation? Aile. Eating a rose—there's one in that bouquet! St. James. The rose my love gave with her heart away! Yet, in such cause, to hesitate were sin! (gives rose to Aile-de-Pigeon, who gives it to the Stag.) Aile. Eat, sir, and jump for joy out of your skin. The Stag disappears, and St. Denis is seen in his place. St. Den. My brother champion, and my liberator! St. James. Of this vile deed, who was the perpetrator? Voice. (from the tree) Let me out, and I'll tell you in a minute. St. James. A talking tree! Aile. There is some Miss Tree in it! St. James. Then let her out by all means. St. Den. So I would, man, If I but knew the way. Voice. Then, like a good man, Don't spare the tree, but fell it at a blow, With your good sword. St. Denis. “Mont joie!” then, be it so! It seems ungrateful to the boughs that hid me, But, by their leaves, I'll do just as you bid me, Music—He strikes the tree with his sword—It sinks and discovers the Princess Mora. Mora. Thanks, noble champion, a Princess am I, The daughter of the King of Thessaly, Boxed up for seven years alone to pine, Because I boxed the ears of Ormandine, A necromancer then at Court the fashion, Who dared confess to me his lawless passion. Enter Ormandine. Orman. Who ventures mighty Ormandine to name? Ah! fiends and fire, 'tis lucky that I came. St. Den. Fair Princess, I your champion am for life. Away! St. James. Stop! I would also take a wife. Enter Leporello and Zuliemah. Lep. And here she is, sir, ready to be taken! Zulie. Oh! fly, my love, before my father waken! (going) Orman. Not quite so fast. St. Den. S'death! quickly clear the course, sir, or— Orman. You are a saucy one, but I'm a sorcerer. Mora. 'Tis Ormandine himself! St. James. The wizard slay! Orman. Fiends of the desert, hearken, and obey. Simoon and sand-storm darken earth and sky, And sweep my captives off to Tartary! (Music—Storm—Enter Demons—The Knights, their Ladies, and Attendants are borne off by Ormandine and Storm Fiends) Scene Third. —Hall in the Giant's Castle—Arch in centre, closed by curtains. Enter Lazzarone. Laz. Who'd serve a giant? There can be no doubt, The way to serve him is to serve him out! And so I would, before he was much older, Had nature made me just a trifle bolder. But I confess that, in my composition, Courage has been a singular omission; And in my cranium, as described by Gall, Combativeness I cannot find at all! Air—Lazzarone—“Non piu mesta.” I'm of that opinion quaintly told, In verse, called Hudibrastic, Which persons who are over bold Profess to think sarcastic. 'Tis “That he who fights, and runs away, May live to fight another day;” Whilst he who is in battle slain In future counts as Zero. Then who a doubt can entertain That prudence proves the hero! For he who is in battle slain Can never rise to fight again; Whilst he who fights and runs away The field again may trot to, Unless, as in my case, I'd say He would much rather not to. Here comes the lady, who, with voice and lute, Lulls every night to sleep the monstrous brute! One of the King of Thrace's seven daughters. The other six are swans on yonder waters; Poor spell-bound birds, with no hope their release of; Their only crime, they wouldn't be made geese of. Enter Una. Una. Good Lazzarone! I'm in such a flurry— Where is the Giant? Laz. Gone out in a hurry— Called for his seven-league boots, before I'd black'd 'em, And pulled them on so hard he almost crack'd 'em; Put on his great great coat, that wasn't brushed! Shouldered his awful club, and out he rushed! Una. That's some relief, for know, to my amazement, I saw just now, whilst peeping from my casement, The nicest young man, standing in the garden, Who most politely bowed, and begged my pardon; But having heard of our sad situation, He'd come to offer us emancipation. Laz. Emancipation! a poor silly youth, Who wouldn't fill the giant's hollow tooth! Dissuade him, madam, from the rash endeavour, Or we shall be in a worse scrape than ever! Una. No! for this beating heart with love is quite full! I've let him in— Laz. You have! for something frightful! Enter St. Anthony. St. Ant. For something handsome, rather say, you lout, For I'm let in to let this beauty out! Words I have none to speak my admiration, St. Anthony ne'er had such a temptation. Laz. St. Anthony! St. Ant. Of Italy. Laz. Evviva! Oh, then in you I must be a believer! From Naples, I, Povero Lazzarone, Forced by stern fate from mirth and maccaroni; Slave to a monster who delights to beat me, And tells me to be thankful he don't eat me! St. Ant. Destroy the wretch! Laz. It's easy to say do it; His skull's so thick, no pickaxe could break through it! Una. His heart's so hard, no dagger need he dread! Laz. His neck's so stiff, you can't cut off his head; Whilst yours he'd twist as easy as a pigeon's! St. Ant. I bring a wond'rous charm from happier regions, The gunpowder of intellectual progress, That floors the giant, and eats up the ogress; Lay to it but the train of education, And fire it with the spark of emulation, A blaze of light these gloomy walls will rend, And put to brutal ignorance an end! Una. Quick, where's the charm? St. Ant. Already in the mine. Beneath his chair, placed there by hands divine, I'll lay the train, and wake the electric spark That shall achieve your liberation. (two loud knocks) Una. Hark! Laz. Oh, murder, there's his thundering double knock, It gives my nervous system such a shock! Una. He has come home to supper. St. Ant. Let him sup, After his blow out, shall come his blow up. Music—They retire—The curtains of the centre arch open and discover the Giant seated at a table. Giant. How now! my supper, slaves, I'm hungry—zounds! Why isn't it on the table, lazy hounds? Quick, or I'll gobble you up, one and all! Slaves enter with supper, which they place on table. I've walked a thousand miles to make a call On my friend, Ormandine, to talk about These seven young vagabonds, but he was out. Confound it! I'm not easy in my mind; Where'er I go some of these boys I find Are setting folks agog for knowledge, freedom, Peace, commerce, and all things to good that lead 'em! There'll be an end soon of these dear dark ages, War be unknown, and labour gain fair wages, No slaves to trample on, no weak to plunder— What's to become of all great rogues, I wonder? Laz. (aside and peeping) I long to see what will become of one. Giant. What, ho! you slaves; there, take away, I've done. (Slaves remove plates) Where's Una? Una. (advancing) Here, my lord. Giant. I want my nap! Sing. Laz. (aside) It will be your dirge, I hope, old chap. Una. What shall I sing, sir? Giant. Something very grand— That means, which nobody can understand, And consequently everybody's praising; How fast I sleep through it, is quite amazing. Una. (aside) I'll sing a ballad, taught me by my mother, The stupid brute don't know one air from t'other! National Ballad—Una—To its own air. Hush a bye baby upon the tree top, When the wind blows the cradle will rock; When the bough breaks the cradle will fall, Down tumbles baby and cradle and all. Hark, how he snores! asleep already fast. Laz. There is a match for him, I hope, at last. Una. Now at a blow, Sir Knight, our bondage end. St. Ant. Here goes! Laz. And up goes our extensive friend! (an explosion—The Giant and building disappear, and change to Scene Fourth. —Coral Grotto and Fairy Lake—Six Swans are discovered on the lake, with golden crowns on their heads, and golden collars and chains round their necks. Laz. St. Anthony for Italy! bravo! 'Twas a toss up, but we have won the throw. Una. Oh, gallant champion, crown your noble deed, See where my sisters for their freedom plead. Laz. Their swan-like necks are yet as free from red scars, As swan-down boas, bought at Swan and Edgar's! But when foul Ormandine learns what you've done, With swan shot he'll bring swans down every one! St. Ant. Alas! fair maiden, useless here my aid is, I have no power to help these poor young ladies! (trumpet without) A trumpet? who comes hither—friend or foe? Laz. Oh, signor! such great news! (bagpipes) St. Ant. Those sounds I know! Enter St. Andrew, Bagpiper, and King of Thrace. St. And. Your friend and brother! Una. And I know that face! My royal father! St. And. Yes, the King of Thrace. Wandering within a wilderness hard by, I found him piping his paternal eye; And pitying the poor old Pagan's pucker, Proposed to give his seven daughters succour; Provided he would change for ours his creed, To which he for himself and heirs agreed. You, my brave friend, the Giant's goose have cooked, I to re-dress his swans by fate am booked; Instead of Pagan fowl, be Christian fair! Sink swans—and rise the darling ducks you were! Chorus—Invisible Spirits—“Scots wha' hae.” Swans that bitter tears have shed, Swans that weary lives have led, Sink into your watery bed And shake your feathers there. Now's the time of day, my flowers, Of Ormandine we brave the powers; Rise at this command of ours— Ladies as you were! “The Lass of Gowrie.” See, they rise in all their charms! They've dropped their wings, and shoulder'd arms, While Scotland's ancient music warms To life the fairy waters, Starting from their grottoes round, Wondering nymphs with lilies crown'd, Dance to that inspiring sound, As they were Scotland's daughters! Music—During which the Swans sink, and in their place Six Princesses appear, gorgeously attired, seated in mother-of-pearl shells—Dance of Water Nymphs. END OF ACT FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene First. —Egyptian ruins in the Valley of the Nile—Egyptian Herdsmen and Peasantry discovered. Chorus —Music by Rodwell. Ul! ul! ul! our hearts are full Of grief this fine May morning. The Dragon's got a prize, this lot Poor people's daughters scorning. Ul! ul! ul! that Fate should cull The flower of Egypt's fair, O! A precious row the Sultan now Will kick up in Grand Cairo! Enter Charley Wag. Char. Your pardon, good ladies and gentlemen all, May I ask why so loudly you keep up the bawl? I'm a stranger, you see, just arrived—not a native, So I beg you'll be candid and communicative. Herd. Why, where could you drop from, I should like to know? If you yet have to learn the sad cause of our woe; Did you never hear tell of the terrible Dragon, Whom no mortal ever as yet put the gag on? For many long years the detestable glutton, Out of flocks of our sheep took his large chops of mutton! Then pounced on our shepherds, till scarce you'd a man see, And now to our maidens he's taken a fancy; And thinks nothing, forsooth, worthy his mastication, But the daintiest fair he can find in the nation. Char. I'm astonished—not at your alarm, or your haste, But to think that a dragon should have such good taste! For if I were a cannibal, such as this blade is, I should certainly preference give to the ladies; But can't you find some one, for love or for cash, Who could manage to settle this epicure's hash? Herd. Not a soul—so by lots the poor lasses grow thinner, For a damsel, per diem, he has for his dinner; And what now increases the nation's distress, The lot has to-day fallen on the Princess, Fair Sabra, the Sultan's sole darling and jewel— Char. Delighted to hear it (all express surprise) Don't fancy me cruel! For her Highness, believe me, I'm truly concerned, But the way of the world, by experience I've learned, This plague might have fasten'd your poor human kind on, And maidens have murmured, but still have been dined on; But now the shoe pinches the Sultan's own poppet, Depend on it, means will be soon found to stop it. Herd. But the Sultan himself of the Dragon's in fear— Char. Well! I'm happy to say that I know some one here, Who has no dread of any monstrosity living, And will soon put an end to this shocking misgiving. Herd. Your name, sir, pray permit me to inquire— Char. Your humble servant, Charley Wag, Esquire. Air—Charley Wag—“A master I have.” A master I have, and I am his man, Galloping fearing none; A master I have, and I am his man, Galloping, &amp;c. To put down the Dragon he'll hit on a plan, And tickle his toby if any one can, With a scaly, maily, taily, gaily, Spiry, fiery, wingery, springery, Gobbling greedy one. From England we came, by the overland mail, Waghorny quickly done; From England we came, by the overland mail, Waghorny, &amp;c. Where the sign of a dragon turns nobody pale, But simply inspires a thought of pale ale, With its wisky, frisky, worky, jerky, Hoppery, poppery, spittery, bittery, Frolicking frothy fun. But St. George is the foe of oppression and guile, Galloping fearing none; But St. George is the foe of oppression and guile, Galloping, &amp;c. His name alone gives them a fit of the bile, And his cannon before has been heard on the Nile, With a haily, saily, navy, gaily, Battering, shattering, sticking 'em, licking 'em, Gallant and glorious one! So “cheer up, my boys, 'tis to glory we steer,” Going it, dingery dong: “To add something more to this wonderful year.” Stop! hang it—I've somehow got wrong. Those are not the right words, I'm sure, to this air; But they mean what I mean, so perhaps you won't care, In a jingling, chiming, crambo, rhyming, Pattery, clattery, what can it mattery, Charley Wag sort of a song. Herd. Haste with these hopes to chase the Sultan's blues! (Herdsmen exeunt) Char. Here comes St. George! Enter St. George. St. Geo. Well, Charley, what's your news? Char. Sir, there's a job for you, just in your way,— A beauty to assist, a beast to slay. St. Geo. I mean to do it—I have heard the tidings, And hope to give the soundest of all hidings To this vile Dragon, to whose breath pestiferous, The Serpentine compared is odoriferous! The foul state of the Serpentine was then a subject of continued animadversion. Char. The victim shortly to her fate they lead on. She's much too nice for such a brute to feed on. St. Geo. The tempting morsel from his jaws I'll snatch, Out of his wicked will himself I'll scratch! Go, for the Dragon keep a look-out bright, And let me know the moment he's in sight! In the meanwhile, fair Sabra I will talk with. (Exit) Char. And off, no doubt, eventually walk with. We'll pack off to London the Dragon when stuff'd He'll make as good gape seed as ever was puff'd, And more worth a shilling to see than one half Of the sights which they gull with poor Johnny Bull-calf. Air—Charley Wag—“O such a day.” O such a town, such a wonderful metropolis, With mysteries and miracles all London teems; Humbug has there got the snuggest of monopolies, Everything is anything but what it seems. You sleep upon an iron bed and fancy it a feather one, You think your ceiling carved in oak—why, bless you, it's a leather one; Your marble mantelpiece turns out of slate, if you're a scrubber, sir, And paving stones are made of wood, or else of india-rubber, sir. O, such a town, &amp;c. O such a town, such a classical metropolis, Tradesmen common English scorn to write or speak; Bond Street's a forum—Cornhill is an acropolis, For everything's in Latin now but what's in Greek. Here is a Pantechnicon, and there is an Emporium, Your shoes are “antigropelos,” your boots of “pannuscorium;” “Fumi-porte chimney-pots,” “Eureka shirts” to cover throats, “Idrotobolic hats,” and patent “Aqua-scutum over-coats.” O such a town, &amp;c. O such a town, such a picturesque metropolis, Taste is polychromical for painting wild; Frescos for peers and art-unions for the populace, Schools where young designers learn to draw it mild. Dioramas, Cosmoramas, Cycloramas, charming ones, Mississipi Panoramas, four miles long—alarming ones! A national collection, where they never ask a fee at all, Besides the Vernon Gallery, a sight no one can see at all. The Vernon Collection was at that time in a dark basement story in Pall Mall. O such a town, &amp;c. O such a town, such a musical metropolis, 'Mid so many bubbles surely some must squeak; Two Italian Operas—one over safe to topple is, Shilling concerts, shilling balls, and Poses Plastiques. Ethiopian Serenaders, Infantine Precocities, “Samuel Halls” in cyder cellars, growling black atrocities; Every public-house allowed to clatter keys and twiddle strings, Whilst the poor old English drama sits and frets herself to fiddle strings. O such a town, &amp;c. (Exit) Music—Enter Guards with the Princess Sabra—they attach her to one of the pillars of the ruined Temple, and exeunt—Re-enter St. George. Sabra. Was ever Princess in so sad a scrape? Were I unbound, I'm bound not to escape. Come quickly, death, put up poor Sabra's hatchment, Victim of this unfortunate attachment. St. Geo. Despond not, damsel, for St. George am I, Beneath this sword your scaly foe shall die, My flag has floated Alexandra o'er, And Aboukir has heard my cannon roar. Air—St. George—“British Grenadiers.” This flag at Alexandria Was borne through victory's cheers, When gallant Abercrombie led The British Grenadiers! And it waved above a hero, To England still more dear, In the thundering row-de-dow-row-de-dow; In the Bay of Aboukir. Sabra. Will you espouse my cause? St. Geo. Ay, if I may so, And after you. Sabra. You're very kind to say so, But when the Dragon comes, and breathes his flame, Displays the claws with which he'll urge his claim, I fear you'll very disagreeable find it. St. Geo. I'm a stout little fellow, and don't mind it. Air—St. George—“When the lads of the village.” When the Dragon I've tickled so merrily, ah! (Who's behaviour's uncommonly wrong) I vow unto thee, that verily, ah! Verily, ah—verily, ah—verily, ah! Thou and I shall be married ere long. Yea, as soon as the brute who my dear would devour, Unmistakably brown shall be done, Let thy Mameluke daddy look ever so sour, In the church we'll be shortly made one. When the Dragon, &amp;c. Re-enter Charley Wag. Char. He's coming. Sabra. What, the Dragon? Char. I believe you, And such a dragon, sir, I don't deceive you, When I assure you he's the funniest fellow, A sort of green and yellow Punchinello, Flapping about his queer shaped legs and wings, As if his body were all full of springs. Now upon four legs, now on two he prances, And now a sort of college hornpipe dances, Whilst up beneath his arm his tail he twitches, As sailors on the stage their little switches. To me he's more amusing than alarming, I've no doubt, if he chose, he could be charming. St. Geo. Here is the fiddlestick shall make him caper To a new tune! Oh, thou unthinking gaper. Because crime gambols folly's garb beneath, You laugh and do not heed his claws and teeth! This Dragon is the foulest fiend on earth, Of pestilential sophistries the birth. License (the name by which he's sometimes known) Poisons the people, undermines the throne, Assumes of liberty the glorious dress, Degrades the muses and pollutes the Press. Never may England suffer from its rage! St. George against it endless war shall wage. This loyal sword shall the vile traitor slay, Or drive him, howling, from the realms of day! Char. Gad, there's no nonsense about my young master, He means to fight when he throws up his castor; Rogues must look out when England lays about her, I don't know what the world would do without her. Sabra. The Dragon's here! St. Geo. Fear nothing, gentle maid, Let him come on! Char. Yes, damme, who's afraid! (they retire) Music—Enter the Dragon dancing a hornpipe; he has his tail under his arm, and uses an eye-glass, &amp;c.—He approaches Sabra, very politely bows, and is about to attack her, when he is opposed by St. George and Charley, who attack and kill him, cutting off his head and tail, &amp;c.—Charley releases Sabra—A loud shout is heard—The Sultan, Guards, and People enter. St. Geo. Sultan, receive your daughter safe and sound; The Dragon fiend lies breathless on the ground. (two Guards bear off the body of the Dragon, headed by Charley) Sul. And how shall we your services repay? St. Geo. By this fair hand, which I have won to-day, And a free passage to the Eastern Indies, Where I must go and kick up a few shindies. Sul. Indeed! St. Geo. Some friends of mine are there in trouble, A wizard with them has been playing double; He's clapped, according to my last despatches, Two of my knight companions under hatches; Thrown into a mesmeric sort of trance The gallant champions both of Spain and France; And may more mischief do if I don't stop him, But let me catch him, and oh, won't I whop him! Sul. Our daughter and our friendship both are yours; England's alliance Egypt's life insures; Throughout our land to come, to stay, to go— For self and friends the freedom we bestow. Glee—“Red Cross Knight.” Blow, trumpets, blow, and big drums thump, And your banners wave on high; For St. George, he has fought like a slap-up trump, And has won the victory! Let his praise be sung By old and young, And the feast eat merrily. Solo—St. George. Oh! I have come from St. George's Fields, The obelisk hard by, The only device I can bear is my shield's, The Red Cross Knight am I. I travelled here by the overland. And have won the victory O'er the Dragon so dread, Who had otherwise fed On the hope of your family. Chorus. Thou'rt welcome here, brave Red Cross Knight, To cross o'er our Red Sea; To make free you have sure a right With those whom you've made free. So all in Grand Cairo shall rejoice That you've won the victory! And your praise shall be sung By old and young, And the feast eat merrily. (Exeunt all) Scene Second. —Bog and Forest, near Crow-Patrick, County Donegal. Enter Murphy. Mur. Och, Winisthru and Philliloo, and all The “sthru's” and “loo's” an Irishman can bawl, What will I do? The country swarms with vermin, And how to deal with 'em I can't determine; They've eaten up my pigs, the dirty creatures! And now, by dad, they've got in the potatoes! Let fly into the darlings' mealy faces, And given 'em all black eyes in the wrong places. If I had anything to eat, the question I'm sure would give me quite an indigestion. Air—“St. Patrick's Day in the Morning.” A plague on the question it makes such a pother, And settle it seemingly nobody will; This party proposes some measure or other, Which t'other insists upon scorning; Still they keep talking—talking, talking— Still they keep talking, talking on. There's no legislation Can stop agitation, And if one goes further, The other cries “murther!” We're worse off than ever—we're ruined, undone! Will no one determine To kick out the vermin— St. Patrick's day in the morning. And sure, because I've not enough to fret me, The girls, the devils, they alone won't let me; And not content with our own colleen oges, Fate's sent a lot of foreigneering rogues. A whole half-dozen on the coast jist landed, A band of husseys that would be husbanded; Playing at hop-scotch after some young Scot, Who did—I don't know where—I don't know what; But after changing them from some foul shapes, Changed his own mind and left them to lead apes. St. Andrew, faith, they call him, serve 'em right, St. Patrick was the boy for them to fight; Sure he'd have never left, but loved a score of 'em, If their ould mother had had any more of 'em. Air—“Savourneen deelish.” O sad was the hour when St. Andrew departed, And left six poor maidens with hearts fit to crack, 'Twas said in a steamer for Ireland he'd started, So after him hither they sailed in a smack. At first they thought sooner in Scotland they'd find him, But a wise man declared, and implored them to mind him: When the banks of the Tweed he had once left behind him, 'Twas seldom a Scotchman was known to go back. Air—“Paddy O' Rafferty.” But before they'd come here they had better gone back again, For it's taken to steer, he has, on a new tack again; It's a bitterish pill, and they're crying “O, lack!” again, But it's “Fly away, Gill,” after “Fly away, Jack,” again! Up in a hurry their traps they must pack again, Off they must scurry on board their old smack again, If they have luck they may hit on his track again, If not the poor ducks on a pond may go quack again. Ri tol tooleroloo, &amp;c. Shrieks and cries of “Help! Help!” Mur. Murder in Irish! what's this hubbaboo? The foreign females in an Irish stew! A prey to wild men of the woods. Hurried music—Enter Six Wild Men dragging the Six Daughters of the King of Thrace. Leave go! Ye villains! wigs upon the green, here! ho! He attacks the Wild Men, and is getting the worst of it when Enter St. Patrick. St. Pat. St. Patrick to the rescue! (he slays and beats the Wild Men off) Mur. Eh! what's that? St. Patrick! By the powers, you have come pat! O! ladies, ladies, down upon your knees, And help me bless St. Patrick, if you please. (they kneel) St. Pat. Nay, my good fellow, little have I done— Mur. Little! you've kilt the blackguards every one! St. Pat. Little, I mean, to what I hope to do. Of Erin's troubles these are but a few; I came the Emerald Isle of all to clear, That keep her foes in hope, her friends in fear: Out of the grass I'll hunt the cunning snake, That lives upon the mischief he can make; Drive from the sunny bank the fierce black adder, That stings half frantic men to make them madder; Banish the bloated toad that fat has grown, Squatting upon the peasant's cold hearth-stone; And from the poor patch of the cultivator, Chase the devouring aphis devastator! Mur. Kick out the serpents and restore the murphies! Oh! you'll be blest wherever bog or turf is. Sir, if a clearance at that rate is made, It will be something like “a rate in aid.” St. Pat. And you, fair strangers, if you've no objection, To place yourselves beneath my poor protection, I know the object of your visit here, And when I've seen this coast of evil clear I'll with you seek the brave St. Andrew out. The cautious Scot concealed from all his route; But I suspect he's gone to Tartary, Where two brave knights in magic slumber lie. This four-leaved shamrock by its power shall do, Justice to Ireland first, and then to you. Air—St. Patrick—“The Four-leaved Shamrock.” I've found the four-leaved shamrock, And with its holy spell; I'll clear of vermin venomous, The land I love so well. The plague that poisons all her food, Its virtue shall destroy, And Erin's honest heart again Beat high with love and joy; For so I'll play the enchanter's part And scatter bliss around, That not a thing to wound or sting, Shall in the isle be found. (Exit) Mur. Justice to Ireland! Bannagher that's beating! Ladies, I hope and trust you don't mind waiting. St. Patrick is a gentleman, good luck to him, And sticks at nothing to serve those who've stuck to him. Song—Air—“St. Patrick was a gentleman.” St. Patrick is a gentleman, And comes of decent people, He built a church in Dublin town, And on it put a steeple. His father is a Gallagher, His mother is a Brady, His aunt is an O'Shaughnessy, His uncle an O'Grady. So blessing on St. Patrick's fist, For he's our champion Saint O! He gave the snakes and toads a twist, He's a beauty without paint O! Air—“While gazing on the moon's light.” And faith, the whiles I'm talking, Ye see the fun has just begun— The snakes and toads he's walking Out fast as iver they can run. Out wid ye—I bid ye— Too long you've bothered Erin dear; St. Patrick knows a trick Worth two of that ye'd play him here. Get into the Bay of Galloway, For really you can't compete with him; And give the great Sea Serpent, pray, My compliments—if you meet with him! The reptiles cross the stage, driven out by St. Patrick, followed by the Princesses and Murphy. Scene Third. —Enchanted Gardens of Ormandine—In the centre is a Loadstone Rock, out of which protrudes the hilt of the magic sword—Dance of Spirits. Enter Ormandine as the dance concludes. Orman. Vanish! (Exeunt Dancers) Enough of revelry a present, Pleasure I've none for bodings most unpleasant; But two out of these Seven Champions hated, Have I, as yet, in my “lock-up” located; I am not safe till all the other five, Are in my custody, dead or alive! My art has raised illusion to distract them, And by this magnet I may here attract them, And throw them into the mesmeric sleep In which St. Denis and St. James I keep. At present I can do them no more harm, Their Christian creed defies each pagan charm; Oh! but for that I'd make each saint a martyr, And hang St. George up in his own blue garter. (a Spirit rises) Now, Spirit! Spirit. From Thibet, the great Cham's Court, I've hither shot— Orman. And what is your report? Spirit. Bearer of most important news I am. Made for his prowess champion of the Cham, David of Wales has pledged his knightly word To try the adventure of the magic sword. Orman. Lured by the name, no doubt, the Cambrian boaster, Because for sport, I called it my cheese-toaster; Well, let him try, into my trap he'll fall, And find his bait is not the cheese at all. (harp heard without) Hark, to those chords! they speak the Welshman nigh, He'll find some cords much stronger by-and-bye. (Ormandine and Spirit retire) Enter St. David and Ap Shenkin with a harp. Air—St. David—“Jenny Jones.” I come from the court of the great Kara-Khan, sir— His champion I am, though St. David of Wales— To put out the pipe of an arch necromancer Who fills with his vapours this sweetest of vales. I own that a glance from the Cham's lovely daughter To try this adventure put up my Welsh blood; And as my better half I hope her arms to quarter With those of my ancestors up to the flood. Deep in this leafy glen, green as a leek, The wizard holds his soirées fantastiques! Plays all his tricks, deprives, in one séance, His hapless audience of all clairvoyance; Makes all mankind his victims or his butts, And when he can no longer shuffle—cuts. Deserted now seem these bewildering bowers, But devils in a bush are all the flowers, And bent on mischief every branch and bough. Despite of all I will perform my vow! Where is the magic sword whose trenchant blade Has of the loadstone rock a scabbard made, And so defies the strength of mortal arm To draw it forth and break the wizard's charm? Ap Shen. It is here, look you! (pointing to it) St. Dav. Ay, I see the hilt! It is a wicked weapon, by the gilt! To give the fiend a handle would be hard; With blade so sharp I must be on my guard; I'll pluck it out—if I have any luck, At least it shall not be for want of pluck. (attempts to pull out the sword) Ah! as I seize it something seizes me, I sink in slumber! (sinks on a couch which moves on from one side) Orman. (advancing) Nabb'd is number three! Ap Shen. Pless hur and save hur! Orman. Change thy human habit, And burrow there with brutes like a Welsh rabbit. (Ap Shenkin disappears, and a Rabbit appears in his place) Work on, brave spirits, lure them one by one Into my toils, till brown each wight be done! Through yon arcades again bright armour glances, 'Tis Anthony of Italy advances; The hated spark, who with his nostrum famous, Destroyed that dear old giant, Ignoramus. One of my Spirits, in fair Una's shape, He follows blindly and shall not escape; By beauty's semblance lured, he duty fled, Nothing can save a warrior so mis-led. Music—The phantom of Una enters, pursued by St. Anthony. St. Ant. Una, my love! what means this sudden flight, Why dost thou shun thy true and tender knight? Music—The Phantom points to the sword in the rock. What dost thou mutely point at? Ah! a sword! Plunged in the ground, the sign of old, adored By the wild Scythians, and without a doubt, You drew me in here but to draw it out. Come forth! (seizes the handle) What stupor steels my senses o'er? He sinks on bank, which moves on—Una disappears, and Spirit appears in her place. Orman. Featly done, phantom. (Exit Spirit) Fast is number four! The charm works well. Ha! what may this forebode, (looking at his ring) Why pales my magic carbuncle, that glowed With joyous fire? Some dangerous combination, Of hostile powers—and lo! in consternation My Spirits come! Enter several Spirits. Spirit. With evil we're beset. Three dauntless champions have together met; St. George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick, bound By kindred ties, and each for arms renowned; Singly their valour we should fearful find, What power can resist the three combined? Orman. Dissension and distrust between them spread! Spirit. Faction tried that in vain—they struck her dead! Orman. Still in the power of falsehood we are strong. Let dire chimeras rise their path along; Shadows of evil oft will strike alarm, When evil's self would fail! Enter St. George, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, with Charley Wag. St. Geo. Despair thy charm! Thus in the name of truth the spell I break! (pulls the sword out of the rock—Thunder and lightning, a chasm opens at the back, shewing a subterraneous vault, into which Ormandine and Spirits retreat—Scene closes) My brave companions, from your trance awake! St. And. They answer not, though 'tis enough to make 'em. St. Pat. Perhaps, as I am Irish, I could wake 'em. St. Geo. Upon this blade some characters I see! Char. Very bad characters they'll surely be! St. Geo. (reading) “Whilst in the vault seven spirit lamps shall shine, Nought can destroy the power of Ormandine.” Then if they shine much longer 'tis my fault, Into the vault undauntedly I'll vault! Follow your leader, Wag, you I shall want! Char. As long as I can wag, depend upon't. Music—St. George leaps into the vault, followed by Charley Wag—Fiends oppose them with fiery swords—They force their way through—The Fiends attack St. Andrew and St. Patrick, who fight them off as the scene closes. Scene Fourth. —Vault of the Seven Lamps. Music—Enter Ormandine. Orman. I have retreated to my last retreat; My arts can neither terrify nor cheat The downright champion of the ruby cross. How even time to gain I'm at a loss! For upon all my mean wiles fast he stamps; My only hope is in these spirit lamps; From which proceed, by ignis fatuii fed, All the false lights that have the world misled, Kept in a smoke and smother every nation, And may eventually burn all creation. Till every one's extinguished, fraud may juggle, And against truth continue the old struggle. Enter St. George. St. Geo. Then, as St. Andrew says, “bide but a wee bit,” “Magna est veritas et prevalebit.” Guided by truth I've threaded this dark maze, Tracked your sly steps thro' these intricate ways; My sword's keen edge I know you cannot feel, But there's a power sharper edged than steel, Which can push humbug from his highest stool; Nothing kills quackery but ridicule; Its point is fatal to the boldest cheat, Its aqua fortis bites the counterfeit. Its scornful fingers snuff out folly's new lights. And shew up all pretenders in their true lights; Forward, brave Wag, and with burlesque and whim, Douse of this artful dodger every glim. (Exit) Enter Charley Wag. Chaunt ad Libitum—“Alteration.” Well, with which to begin—it don't matter a pin, For they're all much in the same situation; But perhaps this of Italy, flaring-up bitterly, Is the most likely to cause a conflagration. So out that goes pop—and to Spain next we hop, Where there's smoke enough to smother the whole nation, And keeps the poor people in such confusion, That one day under an extraordinary delusion They actually kicked out their nearest diplomatic relation Which might have caused an alteration—an alteration, A very deplorable alteration. And now we advance to our lively friend France Who has lately undergone so much transformation That to say whether she stands on her heels or her hands Is an answer she really might not be able to give without considerable consideration. But we've nothing to do with it—and so I'll not trouble you with it— But extinguish, I hope, in each nation Every sort of desire to kindle any fire Except that of a generous emulation, Which will be an alteration—an alteration— A very capital alteration! As to England, Scotland, and Wales, such very good feeling prevails, That to put out the little farthing rushlights of fermentation That left on their shelves would go out of themselves, Is really almost an act of supererogation. But there is one more—the spirit lamp at next door, Ireland. Which keeps the whole kingdom in such a state of inflammation, That if I have but the wit to put out that, you'll admit I am more up to snuff than any former administration; For it will make an alteration—an alteration— A most desirable alteration! And hark!—by that token!—the spell is now broken, So to finish this rather long-winded oration, I have only to request, as we really have all done our best To add to your amusement and edification, That when, as I mean, I change to the last scene, Which, I think, you will own is a gorgeous decoration, You'll be kind enough to say, in your usual good-natured way, That the scenery, by Mr. Beverley, Has been painted very cleverly, And that the piece, taken altogether, meets with your full approbation, For in your favour we don't want any alteration—alteration— No—not an atom of alteration. (as he puts out the last lamp thunder and Ormandine sinks) Scene Fifth. —The Camp of the Seven Champions—Grand Tableau of St. George and the Dragon—The other Champions ranged under their banners attended by Knights, Ladies, &amp;c.—During the chorus Fame rises over St. George. Finale—Chorus—“Drum Polka.” Bid the gallant champions hail! Who have struggled well and long, In the cause that should prevail— Truth and right, 'gainst fraud and wrong! Laurels they have oft before, Fairly gathered in your sight; Let them gain one laurel more, By a triumph here to-night. CURTAIN.</field>
