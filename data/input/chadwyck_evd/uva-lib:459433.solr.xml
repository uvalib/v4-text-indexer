      <field name="fulltext">A RELATION OF THE LATE ROYALL ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN BY THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORD Knovvles, AT Cawsome-House neere Redding: to our most Gracious Queene, Queene, Anne, in her Progresse toward the Bathe, vpon the seuen and eight and twentie dayes of Aprill 1613. Whereunto is annexed the Description, Speeches, and Songs of the Lords Maske, presented in the Banquetting-house on the Mariage night of the High and Mightie, Covnt Palatine, and the Royally descended the Ladie Elizabeth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For as much as this late Entertainment hath beene much desired in writing, both of such as were present at the performance thereof, as also of many which are yet strangers both to the busines and place: it shall be conuenient, in this generall publication, a little to touch at the description and situation of Cawsome seate. The house is fairely built of bricke, mounted on the hill-side of a Parke, within view of Redding, they being seuered about the space of two miles. Before the Parke-gate, directly opposite to the House, a new passage was forced through earable-land, that was lately paled in, it being from the Parke about two flight-shots in length: at the further end whereof, vpon the Queenes approch, a Cynick appeared out of a Bower, drest in a skin-coate, with Bases of greene Calico, set thicke with leaues and boughes: his nakednesse being also artificially shadowed with leaues; on his head he wore a false haire, blacke and disordered, stucke carelessely with flowers. The speech of the Cynick to the Queene and her Traine. Cynick. Stay; whether you humane be or diuine; here is no passage; see you not the earth furrowed? the region solitarie? Cities and Courts fit tumultuous multitudes: this is a place of silence; heere a kingdome I enjoy without people; my selfe commands, my selfe obeyes; Host, Cooke, and Guest my selfe; I reape without sowing, owe all to Nature, to none other beholding: my skinne is my coate, my ornaments these boughes and flowers, this Bower my house, the earth my bed, herbes my food, water my drinke; I want no sleepe, nor health; I enuie none, nor am enuied, neither feare I, nor hope, nor ioy, nor grieue: if this be happinesse, I haue it; which you all the depend on others seruice, or command, want: will you be happy? be priuate; turne Pallaces to Hermitages, noies to silence, outward felicitie, to inward content. A stranger on horse-back was purposely thrust into the troupe disguised, and wrapt in a cloake that he might passe vnknowne, who at the conclusion of this speech beganne to discouer himselfe as a fantastick Traueller in a silken sute of strange Checker-worke, made vp after the Italian cut, with an Italian hat, a band of gold and silke, answering the colours of his sute, with a Courtly feather, long guilt spurres, and all things answerable. The Trauellers speech on horse-back. Trauell. Whether trauels thy tongue ill nurtur'd man? thy manners shew madnesse, thy nakednesse pouertie, thy resolution folly; since none will vndertake thy presumption; let mee descend, that I may make thy ignorance know how much it hath injured sacred eares. The Traueller then dismounts and giues his cloake and horse to his Foot-man, in the meane time the Cynick speakes. Cyn. Naked I am, and so is truth; plaine, and so is honestie; I feare no mans encounter, since my cause deserues neither excuse, nor blame. Trau. Shall I now chide or pitie thee? thou art as miserable in life, as foolish in thy opinion; answere me; doest thou thinke that all happinesse consists in solitarinesse? Cyn. I doe. Trau. And are they vnhappy that abide in societie? Cyn. They are. Trau. Doest thou esteeme it a good thing to liue? Cyn. The best of things. Trau. Hadst thou not a Father and Mother? Cyn. Yes. Trau. Did they not liue in societie? Cyn. They did. Trau. And wert not thou one of their societie, when they bred thee, instructing thee to goe, and speake? Cyn. True. Trau. Thy birth then and speech inspite of thy splene make thee sociable, goe, thou art but a vaine-glorious counterfait, and wanting that which should make thee happie, contemnest the meanes; view but the heau'ns, is there not above vs a Sunne and Moone, giuing and receiuing light? are there not millions of Starres that participate their glorious beames? is there any Element simple? is there not a mixture of all things? and wouldst thou only be singular? action is the end of life, vertue the crowne of action, society the subject of vertue, friendship the band of societie, solitarinesse the breach. Thou art yet yong, and faire enough, wert thou not barbarous, thy soule poore wretch is farre out of tune, make it musicall, come, follow me, and learne to liue. Cyn. I am conquered by reason, and humbly aske pardon for my error, henceforth my heart shall honour greatnesse, and loue societie; leade now, and I will follow as good a fellow as the best. The Traueller and Cynick instantly mount on horse-backe, and hasten to the Parke-gate, where they are receiued by two Keepers, formally attired in greene Perpetuana, with ierkins and long hose, all things else being in colour sutable, hauing either of them a horne hanging formally at their backes, and on their heads they had greene Mommoth-caps, with greene feathers, the one of them in his hand bearing a hooke-bill, and the other a long pike-staffe, both painted greene: with them stood two Robin-Hood-men, in sutes of greene striped with blacke, drest in doublets with great bellies and wide sleeues, shaped fardinggale-wise at the shoulders, without wings; their hose were round, with long greene stockings; on their heads they wore broad flat caps with greene feathers crosse quite ouer them, carrying greene Bowes in their hands, and grenee Arrowes by their sides. In this space Cornets at sundrie places intertaine the time, till the Queene with her traine is entred into the Parke: and then one of the Keepers presents her with this short speech. Keeper. More then most welcome, renowned and gracious Queene, since your presence vouchsafes to beautifie these woods, whereof I am Keeper, be it your pleasure to accept such rude intertainment, as a rough Wood-man can yeeld. This is to vs a high holy-day, and henceforth yearly shall bee kept and celebrated with our Countrie sports, in honour of so Royall a guest; come friends and fellowes now prepare your voices, and present your ioyes in a Siluan dance. Here standing on a smooth greene, and enuironed with the Horse-men, they present a Song of fiue Parts, and withall a liuely Siluan-dance of sixe persons: the Robin-hood-men faine two Trebles, one of the Keepers with the Cynick sing two Countertenors, the other Keeper the Base; but the Traueller being not able to sing, gapes in silence, and expresseth his humour in Antike gestures. A Song and Dance of sixe, two Keepers, two Robinhood-men, the fantastick Traueller, and the Cynick. [1.] Dance now and sing the ioy, and loue we owe: Let chearfull voices and glad gestures showe, The Queene of grace is shee whom we receiue, Honour and State are her guides, Her presence they can neuer leaue. Then in a stately Siluan forme salute Her euer flowing grace. Fill all the Woods with Ecchoed welcomes, And strew with flowers this place: Let eu'ry bow and plant fresh blossomes yeeld, And all the aire refine. Let pleasure striue to please our Goddesse, For shee is all diuine. 2. Yet once againe, let vs our measures moue, And with sweet notes record our ioyfull loue. An obiect more diuine none euer had. Beautie, and heau'n-borne worth, Mixt in perfection neuer fade. Then with a dance triumphant let vs sing Her high aduanced praise, And eu'n to heau'n our gladsome welcomes, With wings of musick raise; Welcome, O welcome, euer-honoured Queene, To this now-blessed place, That groue, that bowre, that house is happy Which you vouchsafe to grate. This song being sung and danced twice ouer, they fall instantly into a kinde of Curranta, with these wordes following. No longer delay her, 'Twere sinne now to stay her From her ease with tedious sport; Then welcome still crying, And swiftly hence flying, Let vs to our homes resort. In the end whereof the two Keepers carrie away the Cynick; and the two Robin-hood-men the Traueller, when presently Cornets begins againe to sound in seuerall places, and so continue with varietie, while the Queen passeth through a long smooth greene way, set on each side with Trees in equall distance; all this while her Maiestie being carried in her Caroch. But because some wet had fallen that day in the forenoone (though the Garden-walks were made artificially smooth &amp; drie) yet all her foot-way was spred with broad cloth, and so soone as her Maiestie with her traine were all entred into the Bower Garden, a Gardiner with his Man and Boy, issued out of an Arbour to giue her Highnesse entertainment: The Gardener was suted in gray with a ierkin double iagged all about the wings &amp; skirts, he had a paire of great slops with a cod-peece, and buttoned Gamachios all of the same stuffe: on his head he had a strawne hat, pibaldly drest with flowers, and in his hand a siluered spade: His man was also suted in gray with a great buttoned flap on his ierkin, hauing large wings and skirts, with a paire of great slops and Gamachios of the same, on his head he had a strawne hat, and in his hand a siluered Mattox: The Gardiners Boy was in a prettie sute of flowrie stuffe, with a siluered Rake in his hand: when they approched neere the Queene, they all valed Bonet, and lowting low, the Gardner began after his anticke fashion this speech. Gard. Most magnificent and peerelesse Diety, loe I the surueyer of Lady Floras workes, welcome your grace with fragrant phrases into her Bowers, beseeching your greatnesse to beare with the late woodden entertainment of the Wood-men, for Woods are more full of weeds then wits, but gardens are weeded, and Gardners witty, as may appeare by me. I haue flowers for all fancies, Tyme for truth, Rosemary for remembrance, Roses for loue, Hartsease for ioy, and thousands more, which all harmoniously reioyce at your presence; but my selfe, with these my Paradisians heere, will make you such musick, as the wilde Wooddists shall bee ashamed to heare the report of it. Come sirs prune your pipes, and tune your strings, and agree together like birds of a feather. A Song of a treble and base, sung by the Gardiners boy and man, to musicke of Instruments, that was readie to second them in the Arbour. 1 VVelcome to this flowrie place, Faire Goddesse and sole Queene of grace: All eyes triumph in your sight, Which through all this emptie space Casts such glorious beames of light. 2 Paradise were meeter farre To entertaine so bright a Starre: But why erres my folly so? Paradise is where you are Heau'n aboue, and heau'n below. 3 Could our powers and wishes meete, How well would they your graces greete, Yet accept of our desire, Roses of all slowers most sweete Spring out of the silly brier. After this song, the Gardiner speakes againe. Gard. Wonder not (great Goddesse) at the sweetnesse of our Garden-aire (though passing sweet it be) Flora hath perfumed it for you (Flora our mistresse, and your seruant) who enuites you yet further into her Paradise; shee inuisibly will leade your grace the way, and we (as our duetie is) visibly stay behinde. From thence the Queene ascends by a few steps into the vpper Garden, at the end whereof, neere the house, this Song was sung by an excellent counter-tenor voice, with rare varietie of diuision vnto two vnusuall instruments, all being concealed within the Arbour. 1 O ioyes exceeding? From loue, fr? power of your wisht sight proceeding! As a faire morne shines diuinely, Such is your view, appearing more diuinely. 2 Your steppes ascending, Raise high your thoughts for your content contending; All our hearts of this grace vaunting, Now leape as they were moued by inchaunting. So ended the entertainment without the House for that time, and the Queenes pleasure being that night to suppe priuately: The Kings Violins attended her with their sollemnest musick, as an excellent consort in like manner did the next day at dinner. Supper being ended, her Maiestie accompanied with many Lords and Ladies came into the Hall, and rested Her selfe in Her Chaire of State, the Scaffoldes of the Hall being on all partes filled with beholders of worth, suddainely forth came the Traueller, Gardiner, Cynicke, with the rest of their crue, and others furnished with their Instruments, and in maner following entertaine the time. Traueller. A hall, a hall for men of moment; Rationals, and Irrationals; but yet not all of one breeding. For I an Academicke am, refined by trauell that haue learn'd what to Courtship belongs, and so deuine a presence as this; if we presse past good manners, laugh at our follies, for you cannot shew vs more fauour, then to laugh at vs. If we proue ridiculous in your sights, we are gracious; and therefore wee beseech you to laugh at vs. For mine owne part (I thanke my Starres for it) I haue beene laught at in most parts of Christendome. Gardiner. I can neither bragge of my Trauels, nor yet am ashamed of my profession; I make sweet walkes for faire Ladies; Flowers I prepare to adorne them; close Arbours I build wherein their Loues vnseene may court them; and who can doe Ladies better seruice, or more acceptable? when I was a Child and lay in my Cradle, (a very pretie Child) I remember well that Lady Venus appeared vnto me, and setting a Siluer Spade and Rake by my Pillow, bad me proue a Gardiner; I told my Mother of it (as became the duetie of a good Child) whereupon shee prouided straight for mee two great Platters full of Pappe; which hauing duetifully deuoured, I grew to this portrature you see, sprung sodainely out of my Cabine, and fell to my profession. Trau. Verily by thy discourse thou hast Trauelled much, and I am asham'd of my selfe that I come so farre behind thee; as not once to haue yet mentioned Venus or Cupid, or any other of the gods to haue appeared to mee. But I will henceforth boast truely, that I haue now seene a Dietie as farre beyond theirs, as the beautie of light is beyond darknesse, or this Feast whereof we haue had our share, is beyond thy Sallets. Cynick. Sure I am, it hath stir'd vp strange thoughts in me; neuer knew I the difference betweene Wine and Water before. Bacchus hath opened mine eyes, I now see brauerie and admire it, beautie &amp; adore it. I find my Armes naked, my discourse rude, but my heart soft as Waxe, ready to melt with the least beame of a faire eye, which (till this time) was as vntractable as Iron. Gard. I much ioy in thy conuersion, thou hast long beene a mad fellow, and now prouest a good fellow, let vs all therefore ioyne together sociably in a Song, to the honour of good fellowship. Cyn. A very Musicall motion, and I agree to it. Trau. Sing that sing can, for my part I will onely while you sing, keepe time with my gestures.A la more du France. A Song of three Voyces with diuers Instruments. [1.] Night as well as brightest day hath her delight, Let vs then with mirth and Musicke decke the night, Neuer did glad day such store Of ioy to night bequeath. Her Starres then adore, Both in Heau'n, and here beneath. 2. Loue and beautie, mirth and Musicke yeeld true ioyes, Though the Cynickes in their folly count them toyes. Raise your spirits nere so high, They will be apt to fall: None braue thoughts enuie, Who had ere braue thought at all. 3. Ioy is the sweete friend of life, the nurse of blood, Patron of all health, and fountaine of all good: Neuer may ioy hence depart, But all your thoughts attend, Nought can hurt the heart, That retaines so sweete a friend. At the end of this Song, enters Siluanus, shapt after the description of the ancient Writers; His lower parts like a Goate, and his vpper parts in an anticke habit of rich Taffatie, cut into Leaues, and on his head he had a false. Haire, with a wreath of long Boughes and Lillies, that hung dangling about his necke, and in his hand a Cypresse branch, in memorie of his loue Cyparissus, The Gardiner espying him speakes thus. Gard. Silence sirs, here comes Siluanus god of these Woods, whose presence is rare, and importes some noueltie. Trau. Let vs giue place, for this place is fitter for Dieties then vs. They all vanish and leaue Siluanus alone, who comming neerer to the State, and making a low Congee, speakes. Silvanvs. That health which harbours in the fresh air'd groues, Those pleasures which greene hill and valley moues, Siluanus the commander of them all, Here offers to this State Emperiall; Which as a homager he visites now, And to a greater power his power doth bow, With all, thus much his duetie signifies: That there are certaine Semideities, Belonging to his Siluan walkes, who come Led with the Musicke of a Spritely drome, To keepe the night awake and honour you, (Great Queene) to whom all Honours they hold due, So rest you full of ioy, and wisht content, Which though it be not giuen, 'tis fairely ment. At the end of this speech there is suddainly heard a great noise of drums and phifes, and way being made, eight Pages first enter, with greene torches in their hands lighted; their sutes were of greene Satten, with cloakes and caps of the same, richly and strangely set forth: Presently after them the eight Maskers came, in rich imbrodered sutes of greene Satten with high hats of the same, and all their acoutrements answerable to such Noble and Princely personages, as they concealed vnder their visards, and so they instantly fell into a new dance: at the end whereof they tooke forth the Ladies, and danced with them, and so well was the Queene pleased with her intertainment, that shee vouchsafed to make her selfe the head of their Reuels, and graciously to adorne the place with her personall dancing: much of the night being thus spent with varietie of dances, the Maskers made a conclusion with a second new dance. At the Queenes parting on wednesday in the afternoone, the Gardiner with his Man and Boy and three handsome Countrie Maides, the one bearing a rich bagge with linnen in it, the second a rich apron, and the third a rich mantle, appeare all out of an Arbour in the lower Garden, and meeting the Queene, the Gardiner presents this speech. Gardiner. Stay Goddesse, stay a little space, Our poore Countrie loue to grace, Since we dare not too long stay you, Accept at our hands, we pray you, These meane presents to expresse Greater loue, then we professe, Or can vtter now for woe Of your parting hast'ned so. Gifts these are, such as were wrought By their hands, that them haue brought, Home-bred things, which they presumed, After I had them perfumed With my flowrie incantation, To giue you in presentation At your parting, come feate Lasses With fine cursies, and smooth faces, Offer vp your simple toyes To the Mistris of our ioyes; While we the sad time prolong With a mournefull parting song. A Song of three voices continuing while the presents are deliuered and receiued. 1 Can you the Author of our ioy So soone depart? Will you reuiue, and straight destroy, New mirth to teares conuert? O that euer cause of gladnesse Should so swiftly turne to sadnesse! 2 Now as we droupe, so will these flowers Bard of your sight. Nothing auaile them heau'nly showres Without your heau'nly light. When the glorious Sunne forsakes vs, Winter quickly ouer-takes vs. 3 Yet shall our praiers your waies attend, When you are gone; And we the tedious time will spend, Remembring you alone. Welcome here shall you heare euer, But the word of parting neuer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus ends this ample intertainment, which as it was most nobly performed, by the right honourable the Lord and Ladie of the house, and fortunately executed by all that any way were Actors in it, so was it as graciously receiued of her Maiestie, and celebrated with her most royall applause.</field>
