      <field name="fulltext">The Argvment according to Muretus collection. There were two brethren Citizens of Athens, the one called Chremes the other Phania. Chremes being to trauell into Asia left the charge of his then onely daughter Pasibula an infant with his brother Phania. Shortly after his departure out of Attica, Phania also to auoid the rage of warre growing hot in Greece, shipped himselfe thence with his little niece, directing his course towards the place where he supposed Chremes aboad: but suffering shipwracke was cast with the little one, vpon the shoare of the Isle of Andros, where getting entertainement of a poore Islander he shortly after died. His host after his decease, changeth the childs name from Pasibula into Glycerium; and hauing bred her vp for some yeares in equall education with his owne naturall child called Chrysis, himselfe also dyeth. Chremes in the Interim had returned to Athens, and there had another daughter named Philumena: And all this while supposed his brother and his other daughter to haue long since perished at sea. Chrisis being left fatherlesse and poore leaues Andros, and taking Glycerium with her sailes to Athens; where they dwell together as reputed sisters. Chrisis turnes harlot: her louers draw along with them to her house one Pamphilus sonne of Simo an antient Athenian Citizen. Pamphilus falling in loue with Glycerium gets her with child, and affianceth himselfe to her. Chremes vpon a publique fame of Pamphilus his vertues treates with Simo for a match betweene their children Pamphilus and Philumena: and a marriage is agreed vpon betweene the two old fathers, Pamphilus being not made acquainted. Chrysis soone after dies, at whose funerals Pamphilus occasionally discouered signes of very ardent affection to Glycerium; which Chremes hearing of, renounceth him for sonne in law as one apparantly besotted and intangled with extraordinarie loue to a stragling strumpet (so ignorantly he stiled the issue of his proper loynes) Pamphilus (now first hearing of the determined match) is glad such marriage is disappointed. Simo frets at it. And now is the prefixed day of marriage come, being the day containing the argument of this Comedie. Simo makes shew to all the people of his familie, as if the marriage were on this day to be solemnized, and this he did out of a foxlike subtiltie to feele his sonnes inclination to marriage, and vpon his refusall to haue iust occasion of complaint against him, which hitherto he had not. And if his sonne should declare readinesse to entertaine the match, he then thought it would proue no such difficult matter to ouerrule Chremes; and so the businesse to go on as it was first determined. Simo hauing thus proiected matters, meets his sonne; and wils him to pray to the gods for successe vpon his marriage instantly to bee accomplished. The sonne at his fathers salutation stands thunderstrucken, ignorant what course to take for preuention. Dauus comes to him in this distraction, at what time one Charinus was with him. This Charinus was a yong man inflamed with the loue of Philumena, the intended bride; and was now in a manner desperate, when he vnderstood that Pamphilus was that day to marrie her: Pamphilus assuers him of his purposed resolution to the contrarie. This was the theame of their discourse when Dauus came vpon them. Dauus (now) was Simoes seruant, a fellow of good reach: and he vpon grounds reasonable had conceiued his old masters fetch in this pretended marriage, which (hauing sent away Charinus) he opens to Pamphilus: resoluing him that in all likelihood the old man did but cast out a hooke to catch at his inclination to Glycerium: wishing him therefore without all scruple to promise his father all obedience and readinesse in imbracing this faced marriage; he further intimates, that no hazard was likely hereby to insue: for that Chremes hauing once openly refused him, would not (at least so suddenly) intertaine him for a sonne in law. Pamphilus puts the aduice in execution. Simo and Dauus venter either of them vpon the hazard, but Simo his lucke carries it. For Chremes is wonne to a new consent, and now is Pamphilus in danger to bee cast vpon a present marriage, where hee neuer intended. What may Dauus how do? author of a counsell not so vnlikely as vnluckie? Chance presents him occasion, and he hath good braine to make vse of the least offered occasion: what is that? Glycerium is brought to bed: the new borne child is by her maid (but by Dauus direction) laid at Simo's doore: and this is done iust when Chremes must of necessitie see it: Dauus further so carries the matter, that Chremes vnderstands who is father, who is mother to the child. These things iustly moue Chremes to a second renunciation: Hence great stirre ariseth: Crito a man of Andros (arriued at Athens vpon newes of Chrysis her death, being next heire to her estate) ends all; by discouering Glyceriums freedome &amp; parentage. Pamphilus marries Glycerium now againe knowne by her first name Pasibula; Charinus marries the other sister Philumena.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Ovr Poet first setting his mind to write, Deemd this the sole maine charge vpon him laid, To please the people with the playes he made: But now he finds that he misreckond quite. For, that he cannot (Prologue wise) now lay The argument of this his play aright, Is causd by an old rank'rous Poets spite; Who driues him to cleare faultes, leaue the meant way. Now pray obserue their cauellings: those playes Andria and Perinthia, which Menander wrote, (Know one, know both) not much vnlike in plot, Are different yet both in their stile and phrase. He not denies that from Perinthia Those things which seemd conuenient in the same, He (as his owne) hath drawne into the frame, And course of this presented Andria. This is the thing they challenge: and they braule That in such sort a cleanely Comedie Should not be hotch-potchd. These men verily While much they seeme, shew they know nought at all: Who him accusing draw his presidents NÃ¦uius, Plautus, Ennius, in like crime; To whose mistakings he would rather climbe, Then follow these mens obscure diligence. I further wish'hem hencefoorth keepe'hem still; And cease with euill language him to sting; Lest their ill doing in their eares do ring. Spectators kind, of you we craue good will; In silence shewne and kinde attention; That without preiudice our play y'ould heare: Thence you may fully know, if it rest cleare, That all our future purposd action Of new made playes be to be banisht quite; Without aduentring your hereafter sight:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Scen. 1. Enter Simo and Sosia with two or three seruants more bearing prouision from the Market. Simo. You sirs haue those things in: away I say. Exeunt the seruants. Sosia draw neere; I am to speak with you. Sos. Sir thinke th'errand giu'n; your meaning is I looke to those things carefull cookery. Sim. No: tis another matter. Sos. Pray say on What tis, my art may further doe for you. Sim. Here's neede of no such art, in what I purpose; But of those parts which I haue euer noted To dwell in thee; trust, and true secrecie. Sos. I waite your pleasure. Sim. Since I bought thee first Being then a yongling, in what gentle sort, In what due course, thou ledst thy seruice with me, Thy selfe well know'st: and for I found thee carefull In thy imployments, the best good I had To answer it, I gaue thee; libertie. Sos. I spare it sir in minde. Sim. And I repent not. Sos. It is my harts ioy Master, if I did Or, it can doe, ought to your satisfaction; And further owe you thankes that you acknowledge I well accepted: yet it troubles me, For this remembrancing your benefit, Seemes to vpbraid me, as forgetting it. Pray in one word acquaint me with your pleasure. Sim. I will; but first I tell thee of this thing, This which thou thinkst is no meant marriage. Sos. Why make you as it were then? Sim. Thou shalt heare From the beginning all: and by that meanes Shalt better know my Sonnes forepassed life, My present purpose, and thy future charge. My Sonne hauing past his childhood Sosia Hath now more scope allowed him; before How could one know or sift his disposition, While tender age, feare, tutors awed him? Sos. Sir, you say right. Sim. What almost all youth doe, To set their minde on one some chosen course; That to breede Horse, this Hounds, and both to hunt, A third to study of Phylosophie: He none of these followed professedly, Aboue the rest: but yet all moderately. I ioyd at it. Sos. Sir, not without good cause: âFor to oredoe no one thing, in my sence âTo mans life is of chiefest consequence. Sim. Such his behauiour; all those gently To beare and forbeare, that he kept withall; Apply himselfe to please and humor all; Crosse none, nor proudly seeke to ouertop His young companions: so that easily He got him friends and praise; yet without enuie. Sos. He bare him wisely: for in this times state Sweet yeelding procures friends, blunt truth gets hate. Sim. Meane while a certaine woman three yeeres since Drawne by her wants and kindreds negligence, From Andros Isle came to our neighborhood; Of passing beautie, flouring womanhood. Sos. I feare this Andrian woman bodes no good. Sim. She at the first a sparing chaste life led; At Rocke and Loome, hard labord to get bread: But when a first, a second, a third came; Tendring their loues, gifts promis'd with the same, (As all our natures are prone commonly From labour vnto wanton libertie) She stoop'd to lure, began the gainfull trade. By those that then chiefe loue vnto her made, My Sonne was drawne along occasionally To banquet with 'hem; keepe 'hem company. I to my selfeâSure the young frie is tane: H'as catcht the poisoned bait; with it, his bane. These louers seruants passing to and fro I eu'rie morning watch; and calling to One that I spied, thus question; Prethee lad, Who yesterday yond Chrysis company had? So was the Andrian call'd. Sos. Sir. I conceaue you. Sim. The answer was, PhÅdrus, or Nicerate, Or Clinias (for at that time those three Her ioyntly lou'd.) I reply presently, And what did Pamphilus? what? (answers he.) He stak'd his share, and supp'd: this gladded me. At other times I cast more newes to learne; Still nothing found that did my Sonne concerne. I thought him now proofe-temper'd gainst excesse, Great patterne of a setled staiednesse. For he that deales with natures of this kinde, Yet thereby growes not stagg'ring in his minde; To such a mans owne hands thou maist be bold To leaue the free reignes of his life in hold. As this gaue me most satisfying pleasure, So all tongues talk'd my good, proclaim'd my treasure, In hauing such a qualified Sonne. What should I make further relation? Chremes our neighbour drawne by this same bruit, Freely comes to me; and makes earnest suit To place his daughter, yea his onely one With a large dowre as wife vnto my Sonne: I agreed the marriage, on his motion; And this the day, it is appointed on. Sos. What barre now stoppeth? why in very deede According to the shew, it not proceede? Sim. Ile tell thee: few dayes after this befell, Our neighbour Chrysis died. Sos. That's chanced well. You haue reuiu'd me; I much doubted her. Sim. With Chrysis louers still my Sonne comes there Alike her funerall lookes to; alike cheere Sometimes of sadnesse shewes, sometimes alike Weepes with 'hem: I his carriage well did like. Thus argued I; Her death how tenderly For very small acquaintance doth he take? What, if himselfe had lou'd her? what for me, What will he doe for me, his Fathers sake? All this I thought in my simplicitie, Meerely the functions of humilitie, And of kinde heart. Why lengthen I my tale? My selfe for his sake tend the funerall, Dreaming as yet no euill. Sos. Ha! what meanes this? Sim. Ile cause thee know. The dead corps is brought out; Along we goe; now there amidst the throng Of women, I a maiden very young Perchance espied; of personâ Sos. Perhaps handsome. Sim. I, and of countenance Sosia so delightsome, So modest, faire, that nothing might her staine: Who for she seem'd to me, in all the traine Most to lament; and was aboue the rest Of sweet and comely personage and face. I prest neere to the Maids, askt what she was: They told me Chrysis sister. Instantly It strooke me cold at heart. Oh God! thought I, Hence grew his teares: his tendernesse she breeds. Sos. How I doe feare whither your tale proceeds. Sim. The Funerall goes on: we attend the same To th'Sepulchre she's come: into the flame She's put: all weepe. The maid I named late Approacht the fire, as carelesse, desperate; To her euident danger: here my frighted Sonne Well shewed his long concealed affection So close dissembled: to her hies he fast, And both his armes folding about her wast, My deere Glycerium saies he, how doost? say, What cause hast thou to make thy selfe away? Then she (that all their indeard loue might spie) Cast her selfe on him, weeping tenderly. Sos. How? what doe you say? Sim. Home I get mee streight, Inrag'd and fretting; yet no cause of weight Appeard to me to chide him: he might plead, What foule fact haue I done? what merited? Or wherein faulted, Father? one that sought To burne her selfe, I hindred (as I ought) And sau'd her life. It were a faire reply. Sos. You weigh things well: for if deseruedly He may be chidden which help'd life to saue, Who hurts or spoiles one, what should that man haue? Sim. Next day comes Chremes to me, vrging thus, Oh case to be lamented! Pamphilus (I finde cleare) holds yond stranger harlotrie In place of a iust wife: this earnestly I doe denie, he stifly holds. In fine, I so part with him, as one vtterly Denies to giue his Daughter to my Sonne. Sos. Chid you not Pamphilus yet? Sim. Nor yet I saw A grounded cause to build a chiding on. Sos. Why I pray? Sim. Thus my Sonne might vrge his law: Your selfe sir set a limitation To this my course: the time is comming on, I must my selfe to anothers will apply: Let me ith interim mine owne satisfie. Sos. For what cause then of blaming will you tarrie? Sim. If for loose loue he shall denie to marrie: That is the first occasion that I seeke Against him; and the present way I make By this false marriage, if he shew mislike Is hereby true pretence of blame to take. Besides, if wicked Dauus haue a foot Any contriuement, that he now consume His stocke of knauerie whil'st it cannot hurt Who (I imagine) tooth and naile will practise, And that with purpose rather to crosse me Then please my Sonne. Sos. Why should you so conceaue? Sim. Mak'st thou a question? euill mindes, ill manners. Whom if in any thing I shall discouerâ But what neede talke? if happily it fall (As I doe wish) my Sonne be nothing backward, It onely rests, that I perswade with Chremes: Which I hope may be wrought. Now, be't your charge Well to beare vp this seeming marriage; Fright Dauus; obserue my Sonnes carriage; And note their consultations. Sos. Tis enough, Ile see to't: shall we in. Sim. Goe before, I follow. Exit Sosia. There is no question, my Sonne would decline This marriage; that I markt in Dauus feare, When he had heard the wedding did goe forward. But he himselfe comes forth. Scen. 2. Enter Dauus. Dau. I marld if this would end so, and still doubted Whereto my Masters calme remisnesse tended: Who when he saw his Sonne could haue no wife, Neuer made word to vs on't; nor gaue signe Of being troubled at it. Sim. Now he will Talke to you on't; and as I doe suppose To your no little cost. Dau. This was his cunning, To lead vs on in faire fooles paradise; And in our secure dreaming take vs napping, Hauing no time to cast preuention. A fox ifaith. Sim. What ist the knaue talkes on? Dau. My Master, and vnheeded! Sim. Dauusâ Dau. Ha, what is the affaire? Sim. Come you hither to me. Dau. What now trow is in working? Sim. What saist thou? Dau. What sir the businesse? Sim. Dost thou demand that? Folke talke my Sonne's in loue. Dau. That birladie Concernes the world to thinke on. Sim. Dost marke me In what I say or not? Dau. Oh, yes sir well. Sim. But now of this for me to make inquirie Were no kinde Fathers part. What hitherto H'as done, I passe not: while the time permitted I gaue him way to take his course and pleasures: His yeares now call for a new life, new manners. Henceforward Dauus I require, or rather (If the word may befit me) I request thee, Retriue my Sonne from this loose libertie. Dau. What may this meane? Sim. All these loose libertines That wantonly doe loue, cannot indure To heare of wiuing. Dau. So indeede they say Sim. Beside, if such one chance to light vpon Some patron of his inclination, His raw greene sickly minde he commonly Wonts to the worser part still to apply. Dau. Troth sir I vnderstand you not. Sim. How, not? Dau. No verily: I am your plaine man Dauus; No riddle-teller, cunning Oedipus. Sim. Thould'st then in plaine tearmes haue me speake my minde? Dau. Yes, pray at any hand sir. Sim. If I finde That thou to day vse any cunning crotchet, Whereby to hinder this intended wedding; Or faine wouldst shew thy wits fine nimblenesse: When I haue first well whipt thee, in the Mill Ile thrust thee, to thy very dying day: With this prouiso and condition, If euer I thence free thee, Ile grinde for thee. What, vnderstand'st me yet, or not yet neither? Dau. Yes clearely now; y'haue vs'd no windeabouts, But come to th'matter roundly. Sim. In ought else Saue this, I better could indure a slighting. Dau. Pray sir good words yet. Sim. Mak'st thou a iest on't? I know thee to a haire: but I doe tell thee, Least thou shouldst rashly venture. Doe not say But th'hast had faire warning giu'n thee: looke to't. Exit Simo. Scen. 3. Dau. Vpon my faith now Dauus here's no leasure Left thee, to rest or dreame vpon the matter; For ought I gather of the old mans purpose Touching this wedding: which not wisely holpen Me or young Master vndoes vtterly. Nor can I iudge my best course, him to succour, Or leane to the old mans counsell: forsake him? I doubt his life; assist him? th'others threats; Whom to o're reach it's hard. First h'as discouerd All of their loue: then keepes hard watch o're me, Least I should lead some trumping card in th'way: Which if he finde, I'm lost: or else at pleasure Heele take occasion, be it right, be it wrong; And to the Mill I shall be tumbled headlong. To all these hazards comes another mischiefe: This Andrian woman, be she his wife, or lemman, Is great with childe by him. Now, tis worth nothing To heare their bold aduenture: none can iudge it Fond louers fancie, but meere frenzie rather: For whether boy or girle she shall bring forth, They haue resolu'd to keepe and nourish it. Besides they coyne a prettie cunning sable, Among themselues, that shee's free Atticke borne. There was long since (say they) an ancient Merchant Shipwrackt on Andros Iland; who there died: And that with him then saued, Chrysis Father Tooke vp a little girle. Conceited fiction! To me it seemes vnlikely: yet they sooth Themselues ith' tale. But see Mysis comming Enter Mysis. From out Glyceriums house. Ile to the Market To seeke out Pamphilus: for feare his Father Vnwares doe presse him with this businesse. Exit Dauus. Scen. 4. Mys. Good God Archillis, I doe heare you woman: You would haue Lesbia fetcht; vpon my word She is a drunken gossip, and vnheedie: And one scarce fit to whom you may commit A woman in first childbirth: Yet Ile fetch her. Note you the old ones importunitie! None but her pot-companion will serue turne. But I pray God grant this a good deliuery: Enter Pamphilus. And that the Midwife rather may elsewhere Neglect, then here. But what may be the cause I Pamph'lus see so much disquieted? I feare what it may be. Ile stay a while To know the reason of his troubled gesture. Scen. 5. Pam. Is this kinde dealing? courteous attempt? Is this a Fathers carriage? Mys. What is that? Pam. Oh gods and men your faith! what can be said, Neglect, disgrace, or scorne, if this be none? Say he had ment to marry me to day; Ought I not haue foreknowne it? ought I not Haue bin made priuie to it? Mys. Out alas, Wretch that I am, what doe I heare him talke of? Pam. What should I thinke of Chremes? who denied To trust me as a husband with his daughter? Changeth he minde, because I rest vnchang'd? That he should still thus obstinately indeauor Me most accursed to diuorce and seuer From my Glycerium? which, if it fall out, I am vndone for euer. Amongst men Was euer yet found out one more disgracefull? More euery way vnhappy then my selfe? Men, gods assist me! is there left no way For me to shunne Chremes affinitie? How many wayes haue I bin scorn'd? refus'd? (All done, all ended) the other day cast of Am now againe required: and why so? Vnlesse (I guesse) h'has some deformed piece, Which when he cannot fasten vpon any, He seekes to forst on me? Mys. This talke of his Kils me poore wretch with feare. Pam. For what should I Now of my Father speake? Oh God! that he So weightie a thing should doe so carelesly. Passing now by me in the Market-place, Goe, get you home, saies he; and fit your selfe: This day you must be married Pamphilus. To me his words seem'd of such sound and sence, As he had said, get home and hang thy selfe. I stood confounded at it. Doe you thinke I had a word to vtter? any excuse? Though foolish, false, vnfitting? I stood dumbe. Yet had I known't afore, what could I doe? If any now should aske me, I would surely Vse other course, then (as I did) keepe silence. But now what first thing shall I enter on? So many cares, seuerall distraction, Puzzles my minde: loue, pittie of her, feare About this marriage so loath'd, so neare: Then the respect I owe my Father, who So mildely hath me suffred hitherto Without restraint to runne my owne free race, In euery course I listed: with what face May I now crosse his pleasure? wretched me! I know not what to rest on. Mys. I poore woman Doubt th'end of this irresolution. But now tis very needfull that I draw him To speake with her; or else of her Finde some discourse to him. Whil'st yet his minde Hangs wauering, euery little moment turnes it. Pam. Who ist talkes hereabout? Mysis well met. Mys. Pamphilus and you. Pam. How does my dearest? Mys. How does she? marie sir in pangs of trauaile: And many troublous thoughts come in her minde About this day, once purpos'd for your wedding. She further doubts, least you may minde to leaue her. Pam. May I be thought to minde a thing so foule? And through my fault suffer mine owne deare soule To be abus'd? trusting her heart, her life To me? whom I haue made my dearest wife? May I permit her chaste well trained minde Inforced by foule want to change it kinde? No, I will neuer doe it. Mys. If it lay In you, I neede not feare: but how you may Be forced by your Father, is the doubt. Pam. What Mysis dost thou thinke me such a lout? So ingratefull further? so inhumane, bestiall? That nor acquaintance, loue, or shame, at all May moue or prompt me to keepe plighted faith? Mys. One thing I know, that she deserued hath That you should minde her. Pam. Should minde her Mysis? Euen now the very latest words of Chrysis Touching Glycerium, rest imprinted here; Here at my heart. Her last houre drawing neere, She cald for me: I came to her: all you Voided the roome: being alone we two She thus began. Kinde Pamphilus you see Glyceriums youth and beautie; verily Two weake vnsafe guards (as your selfe perceiue) To keepe her chaste, guard the small stocke I leaue. Wherefore by this right hand I craue of thee, By thy good nature, thy fidelitie: I adiure thee by her here vnfriendednesse Thou wouldst not leaue her: doe not part from her. If as a brother I thee still respected, If she of all men hath thee best affected, As she in all things sought thy full contentment In true obseruance, due obedience. I leaue thee as a friend, a guardian, Father, A husband to her. All the little wealth I leaue behinde, I trust to thy disposing. Then her hand taking, in my hand she clasp'd it; And forthwith died. I then there receiu'd her; Receiu'd will keepe. Mys. Indeede sir I hope so. Pam. But why dost now come from her? Mys. I am sent To fetch the Midwife. Pam. Oh, I prethee hasten. And heare you? see you mention not a word About the marriage: least it may perhaps Adde to her weaknesse. Mys. I doe minde it sir. Exeunt Pamphilus and Mysis seuerall waies.</field>

How dost thou know it? Byr. But ene very now Dauus so told me in the Market-place. Cha. Accursed, wretched me! how hitherto My thoughts haue waited vpon hope and feare? But hope now being fled, my fainting spirits Wasted with care, yeeld to confusion. Byr. Pray, for Gods loue Charinus, since that things Cannot be as you would, seeke to desire What you may compasse. Cha. There is nothing else In all the world I wish, but Philumen. Byr. But how much better were it, to endeauour To vnlodge this idle loue out of your heart, Then thus to talke of that which addes more fewell To this your bootlesse vaine affection? Enter Pamphilus walking in a dumpe. Cha. All men in health can easily prescribe To the sicke patient good directions. If thou wert in my case thy minde would alter. Byr. Well sir then doe your pleasure. Cha. But lo yonder Where Pamphilus is. I doe meane to venture All trials yet, ere I doe fully perish. Byr. What meanes he now to doe? Cha. I will request, Beseech him, open to him all my loue. I hope I may obtaine of him at least, For some few dayes to put the wedding of. I trust in th'Interim somewhat may be done. Byr. That somewhat is iust nothing. Cha. Byrrhia, What think'st thou of it? shall I goe to him? Byr. What else? if he will yeeld to nothing, yet Let him suspect, you haue good minde to horne him If he shall marrie her. Cha. Away hence varlet, With this thy lewd suspition. Pam. Charinus, God saue you. Cha. And you also Pamphilus. I was a comming to you, with desire To craue hope, helpe, health, counsell at your hands. Pam. Troth I haue neither place for counsell left, Nor meanes to helpe: but what's the matter man? Cha. Are you to day to marrie? Pam. So they say. Cha. If you doe Pamphilus, I can assure you, This is the last day you shall euer see me. Pam. How so? Cha. I shame to tell it, Byrrhia prithee Declare the matter to him. Byr. Yes, I will. Pam. What is it? Byr. Sir, he loues your wife that shall be. Pam. Troth he and I are of two seuerall mindes: I can assure thee.

Cha. Yet deferre it of awhile, That I may void hence somewhere, and not see't. Pam. Charinus, now heare me. I doe not think't At any time a part of honestie, When one deserues nought, to expect for thankes. Ide rather shun this match then thou obtain't. Cha. You put new life into me. Pam.

Good God! what good newes bring I? But where trow may I finde Pamphilus out? To rid his feares, and fill his heart with comfort. Cha. He is iocund, at what I know not. Pam. Tut, man, tis, nothing. The mischiefe now afoot, he yet not heares of. Dau. Who if he haue heard of this prepared weddingâ Cha. Doe you not heare him? Dau. I guesse verily Hunts all the towne ore for me, like a madman. But where shall I looke for him? to what place First bend my course? Cha. Why speake you not vnto him? Dau. Ile get me hence, and seeke him. Pam. Dauus, stay: Come hither. Dau. Who ist cals? Oh Pamphilus, I sought you: you here too Charinus? braue. Both in the nicke. Y'are the men, I lookt for. Pam. Oh Dauus Ime vndone. Dau. Tut, list to me. Cha. I am for euer lost. Dau. Your feare I know. Pam. My life now lies at stake. Dau. Yours I know too. Pam. I must be married. Dau. That I also know. Pam. I, but this very day. Dau. You weary me With newes, that I am perfect in already. You feare to haue her; you to misse her. Cha. Th'hast it. Pam. I that's the point. Dau. Well, and I say the point Has then no danger in it. Obserue me. Pam. For Gods sake rid me quickly of this feare. Dau. Lo, I free thee. Chremes now's not minded To trouble you with a wife. Pam. How doest know it? Dau. Your Father tooke me by the sleeue e'en now, And told me this day he would marrie you: Adding much more, which now's no time to talke on. Presently hastning to acquaint you with it, I ranne to the Market-place: there missing you I got to a high rais'd ground, and round about Look'd to espie you; could not. Then by chance I saw Charinus seruant, Byrrhia: Of him I ask'd, he said he had not seene you: It vex'd me: still I cast what I should doe. Returning thence, a certaine iealousie By circumstances bred came in my minde. Vmph! heres small rost; the old man sad, a wedding? It scarce hangs well together. Pam. Whereto this? Dau. I hie me streight to Chremes; thither come, I note a silent stilnesse at the doore. Now, this gaue me good heart. Cha. Well said, goe on. Dau. Somewhile I there continue: all that while I saw no creature passing out or in; No matron there; no decking of the house; No stirre; I neerer came, and peeped in. Pam. I know they are good coniectures. Dau. Doe such things Thinke you agree vnto a nuptiall day? Pam. In troth I thinke not Dauus. Dau. Doe you say, thinke? You construe things not well: the case is plaine. Besides, thence going I met Chremes seruant With hearbs and small sprots for the old mans supper. Cha. Dauus, through thee I am now rid of care. Dau. Nay of my faith not so. Cha. Why man prethee? For thou conclud'st, he will not giue her him. Dau. Conceited pate! as if it therefore followed, If he not haue her, you must marrie her. Vnlesse you lookt toot, make your suit, and meanes T'her fathers friends, you may hap hop wiuelesse. Cha. Thou promptst me well; Ile goe about it streight: Though oft this hope haue faild me: fare ye well. Exit Charinus. Scen. 3. Pam. VVhat meanes my father then? Why doubles he? Dau. Ile tell you. If he now should chafe at you, Cause Chremes will not let you haue his daughter, Himselfe may see he plainly iniur'd you: If he should presse you on, before he knew How your minde stood inclined to the match. But if you shall stiffely denie to wed her; Then he will iustly lay the blame on you: Then shall we haue a coyle on't. Pam. What would'st haue me To vndergoe this marriage? Dau. Pamphilus, He is your Father: and it will be hard T'oppose him: this your sweet heart too (you know) Is friendlesse here. Heele finde cause easily To thrust her out o'th'towne. Pam. Out o'th' towne man? Dau. And speedily too. Pam. Counsell me then Dauus, What I should doe. Dau. Tell him you'l marrie her. Pam. How? Dau. What's the matter? Pam. Should I tell him so? Dau. Why not? Pam. I nere will doo't. Dau. Denie me not. Pam. Perswade me not. Dau. Note, what hence will follow. Pam. To be shut out from her, mew'd vp to this. Dau. No, no such thing. I guesse your father thus Will say to you: my purpose Pamphilus Is that this day you wed: then answer you, Sir, I am ready: pray you tell me now For what cause can he chide you? by this meanes His setled plots you shall disorder cleane: Your selfe yet runne no hazard; for the thought Is groundlesse, vaine, that Chremes may be wrought To giue his daughter: nor doe you let fall Your course, least he his purpose should recall. Tell you your Father that you like the Bride: That, when he would, he haue no cause to chide. And for the dangerous passage that you feare; Ile steare your course, and waft you ouer cleare. No man will giue his daughter as a wife To one discouerd of your wanton life. Heele with some poore man rather seeke to place her, Then suffer you to iniure or disgrace her. But if your father see you quiet take This his command, you shall him retchlesse make. At leasure heele seeke out some other wife, Meane time your fathers death may end the strife Or some like good chance happen. Pam. Thinkst thou so? Dau. There is no doubt ith' world on't. Pam. Take you heede to what you lead me. Dau. Will you sir be quiet? Pam. Ile tell my father as thou bidst me: but There must be care had, he by no meanes know she's with childe by me; for I haue promis'd To giue it breeding. Dau. Oh bold enterprise! Pam. She begg'd this promise of me, as assurance That I would not forsake her. Enter Simo. Dau. Ile looke toot. Your Father's here: let him not note you sad. Scen. 4. Sim. I come to obserue their carriage, note their plots. Dau. He thinkes now surely, youle refuse to marrie: And comes from some lone place premeditate, Thinking to puzzle you with a set speech: Therefore collect your selfe. Pam. Well, as I can. Dau. In this thing Pamphilus you shall take my word, You shall not now change two crosse sillables, If you but say, you readie are to marrie. Scen. 5. Enter Byrrhia listening the incounter betweene Simo and his Sonne. Byr. My Master will'd me (all things else set of) Pamphilus watch: &amp; learn what course he takes About the Bride. This caus'd me dogge him hither: And loe, where he is with Dauus. To my taske. Sim. I see 'hem both together. Dau. Now sir looke toot. Sim. Pamphilus. Dau. Looke you backe as on the sodaine. Pam. Oh, you my father? Dau. I, that's well carried. Sim. As I late told thee, tis my purpose Sonne That thou this day be married. Dau. Now I feare His answer on our side. Pam. Sir, or in this Or in what else I wait vpon your pleasure. Byr. Ha! Dau. Mute. Byr. What said he? Sim. Thou dost now my Sonne As well becomes thee, when so graciously Thou yeeldst to what I craue. Dau. Was I not right? Byr. My Master (as I heare) hath lost his wife. Sim. Get you now in: that when the time requires, We be not driu'n to stay for you. Pam. Yes sir. Exit Pamphilus. Byr. That in nothing one man may trust another! It is an old said saying, and as common, All to themselues wish best. My selfe haue seene The maiden, and remember her a faire one. Which makes me better beare with Pamphilus, If he himselfe had rather nightly bed her, Then let my Master. Ile beare backe this newes: That he may pay me well, for my ill tidings. Exit Byrrhia. Scen. 6. Dau. My Master thinkes now I haue some deuice A foot: and that, for that end I stay here. Sim. What ist, thou talkest Dauus? Dau. Eene iust sir. Sim. What, nothing? ha? Dau. Indeede sir nothing, I. Sim. I sure did looke to heare some newes from thee. Dau. I know tis chanced quite besides his aime: That's it which nettles him. Sim. Ist possible I get thee tell me a truth? Dau. Most readily. Sim. Doos this same wedding grieue him any thing, By reason of the acquaintance that he holds With yonder stranger? Dau. Truely I thinke not: Or if it doe, the matter of his trouble Will be at most two or three daies disquiet: (Conceiue you sir?) then it will clearely vanish. For with himselfe h'as tane a due account, And set all cleare that way. Sim. I doe commend him. Dau. Whilst he had leaue, &amp; his green youth did suffer't He wencht a little; but yet priuately: He euer had a care to keepe his name Vntoucht; as did become a wise yong man. Now mariage fits, he frames his minde that way. Sim. And yet me thought he appeared somewhat sad. Dau. Nothing about this businesse; but there's cause That makes him somewhat angry with you. Sim. What? Dau. A trifle. Sim. What ist? Dau. Nothing. Sim. Tell me what? Dau. He saies y'are ouerniggardish in Cost. Sim. Who, I? Dau. That you haue scarce disbusd ten groats In your prouision for his wedding supper: What (saies he) is this like a Sonnes nuptials Whom chiefely of my fellow batchelors May I inuite (quoth he) to such a banquet? And to speake that which may be said herein; Intruth you are too too sparing, I lik't not. Sim. Hold your tongue. Dau. I haue gald him. Sim. I will see That all shall be well carried. What meanes this? What ist this old fox-hunt doth hammer on? If there be any knauerie, his pate forg'd it. Exeunt Simo and Dauus.</field>

I tell you on't aforehand, for your knowledge: Least you should say hereafter, Dauus plots And cunning manag'd all. I very faine Would worke my selfe out of your iealousie. Sim. How knowst it? Dau. I haue heard so and beleeue it. Sim. They are many &amp; those grounded circumstances, Which my coniectures build on. Nere before Named she her selfe with childe by Pamphilus; And that is false, vnlesse my iudgement erre: But seeing now a wedding is preparing, A midwife streight is sent for, by the maid, Who was to bring a young borne childe with her. Dau. Vnlesse you see a childe, the wedding still Stands fairely. Sim. I but, sirra tell me this, When thou hadst found they plotted this among them, Why told you not it streight to Pamphilus? Dau. Pray, but my selfe then who hath drawn him from her? We know how fondly he did dote vpon her: Now he desires a wife to liue withall. In fine, trust me with this whole businesse: Yet pursue you, to make the marriage vp; And I doe hope the Gods will further it. Sim. Nay, get you in; there see you stay my comming: And haue such things as need in readinesse. Exit Dauus He hath not drawne me yet to giue full credit To this he saies; nor to conclude all true. But I regard it little: the maine thing I rest on, is the promise of my Sonne. Ile now goe speake with Chremes, and desire He would bestow his daughter: that obtaind, Why should I linger? and not now this day Finish the match a foot? doubtlesse my Sonne Will stand t'his word: if not, what hinders me Enter Chremes. But I may force him? and in good time see Where Chremes is. Chremes good time of day. Scen. 3. Chr. Oh! you are the man I sought for. Sim. And I you. Chr. Y'are come as I would wish: a many men Haue press'd vnto me; who report as heard From you, that on this very day your Sonne Should wed my daughter. Now I come to see Whether or you or they be from their wits? Sim. Pray list a while, and I will satisfie This doubt: and withall acquaint you further What suit I haue vnto you. Chr. I attend. Say what you please. Sim. Chremes I request you For loue of God; and for the vnfeigned friendship Which in our youth begunne along together Hath growne vp with our yeares; by the respect You beare your onely child; for my Sonnes cause Chiefe power of whose preseruing lies in you, Lend me your furtherance in this businesse, That the match this day meant may so go on. Chr. Oh! I pray craue it not, as if't were fit I should in this thing listen to your suit? Thinke you me alterd from the man I was, When late I made you promise? if't may be For both our welfares, take my daughter to you But if hereby more harme then good will follow To either of vs by it, then I pray Cast for the common good: as if my daughter Were yours, I father to your Pamphilus. Sim. Nay, that's my meaning Chremes: and I doe Craue nothing of you but vpon such tearmes: Nor would I aske it of you, if the case It selfe did not require it. Chr. Why, how is't? Sim. There's iarre betweene Glycerium and my sonne. Chr. I heare. Sim. So great, I hope 'twill sunder them. Chr. A tale. Sim. In very deede tis so. Chr. Indeede It will iust so (as I shall tell thee) proue; The iarres of louers giue fresh life to loue. Sim. I, but I pray you let vs preuent that, Whilst his loues flame is smotherd by abuse: Before this harlots leaud designes, false teares Reduce his sickly minde to passion, Lets marrie 'hem. Chremes I haue good hope, Faire wedlocke and a wiues experienc'd loue Will eas'ly plucke him out of these feard ils. Chr. You thinke so: but I deeme't impossible That either they will alwaies liue together, Or I may indure their iarring. Sim. How doe you know, Vnlesse you make a triall? Chr. But 'twere hard For me to make such triall in my childe. Sim. Why, all the inconuenience which can happen Should the worst fall (which I pray God forbid) Were at the most a separation. In counterpoise now weigh the benefits That will insue, if my sonne proue reclaim'd: First you restore t'your friend his sonne: your selfe Gaine a fast sonne in law: your childe a husband. Chr. Why, if you thinke it so commodious, For my part I will be no hindrance too't. Sim. I iustly alwaies held you my best friend. Chr. But as to that you said. Sim. What? Chr. Marrie how know you There's now debate betweene 'hem. Sim. Dauus selfe (who is their Counsels inward secretarie) So told me; and withall aduisd me further To haste the marriage with all speed I could. Thinke you he would doe thus, but that he knowes. My sonne desires it likewise? you your selfe Shall heare him. Ho there, one call Dauus forth. Enter Dauus. But loe, I see him comming out a doores. Scen. 4. Dau. I was a comming to you. Sim. What's the matter? Dau. Why is the bride not sent for? it growes late. Sim. Doe you now heare him? I will tell thee Dauus, I lately had thee in some iealousie; That thou didst take the course most seruants hold, By seeking to delude me in the matter. Of Pamphilus wanton louing. Dau. Who, I sir? Sim. I thought so: and for that I kept from you A secret, Ile now vtter. Dau. What was that? Sim. Ile tell thee; for I almost now doe trust thee. Dau. At length you finde what seruant you haue of me. Sim. This was not to haue bin a marriage Dau. What, no. Sim. But I therefore counterfaited, That I might feele your mindes. Dau. What ist you say? Sim. Iust as thou hear'st. Dau. La yee; I could neuer, Thinke such a matter: oh fine cunning plot? Sim. List this; when hence I bad thee get thee in, Chremes came fitly to me. Dau. Are we troe Not lost for euer? Sim. I told all to him Thou late toldst me. Dau. What heare I? Sim. Begg'd of him, And scarce at length won him to giue his daughter. Dau. I am vndone. Sim. What saist? Dau. Excellently done. Sim. Now he's not backward. Chre. Ile straight get me home, And leaue word all be had in readinesse: Thence giue you notice. Sim. Now I prethee Dauus, Exit Chremes Since thou alone hast wrought this marriage for vsâ Dau. Yes sure, I was th'onely worker. Sim. Doe now Indeauour further to reclaime my sonne. Dau. Yes truely, I will looke toot carefully. Sim. Thou maist now do it, whil'st his minde is vexed. Dau. Pray take no Care. Sim. Looke toot then: But where now is he himselfe? Dau. Tis marle but he's at home. Sim. Ile too him then, and to himselfe deliuer All I told thee. Dau. I am now iust nothing. Exit Simo. What hinders, but I fairely take my way Directly to the mill, and fall a grinding? Intreatie may doe nothing; I haue drawne All things to such confusion: first deceiu'd My Master: then haue headlong thrust his sonne Vpon a marriage, that he look'd not for: And cleane against his will: and this to day To be made vp, by my alone procurement. Pray marke th'end of cunning: had I sat still, No euill in the world had happened. Enter Pamphilus. And see where he is. I am a meere dead man. Would I had any meanes to breake my necke now. Scen. 5. Pam. VVhere is the villaine has vndone me? Dau. I Am a plaine castaway. Pam. But I confesse Tis iustly fall'n vpon me; since I am So idle, vaine, and inconsiderate: Ought I to trust my whole state to a slaue; A prating slaue? I haue my follies hire: But vnreueng'd he nere shall scape with it. Dau. Ile nere doubt tempest, if I scape this storme. Pam. But now what answer shall I make my father? Shall I denie to marrie, who but now Consented to it? with what impudence May I dare doe it? neither with my selfe Know I what course to take. Dau. Troth nor I, neither: But I am canuassing my braines about it. Ile tell him Ile forthwith finde out some meanes A little to put off his threatned vengeance. Pam. Ohâ Dau. I'm spide. Pam. Oh, you sir, honest fellow Come neerer, what saist to me? doe you see now How I am puzled through your goodly counsell? Dau. Ile presently make all cleare. Pam. Thou make cleare? Dau. Pamphilus indeede I will Pam. I, as erewhile. Dau. Nay, I hope better Pam. Trust thee pillorie? Or thou make good a case perplexed, lost? See what a suresby I haue trusted too; Who from a quiet state I late stood in, This day hast thrust me on a mariage: Did I not tell thee it would thus fall out? Dau. You did. Pam. What hast then deserued? Dau. Hanging. A little yet let me collect my selfe. Ile streight finde out some helpe. Pam. Oh me accurst: Why want I time to plague thee as I would? This scarce will serue my danger to preuent, Permits me not pursue thy punishment. Exeunt Pamphilus and Dauus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. Scen. 1. Enter Charinus at one doore; Pamphilus and Dauus at another. Cha. May't be beleeu'd? or may it once be talk'd on? That any should be so selfe-wild peruerse, As to take pleasure in anothers harmes? Or thinke his owne gaine sweeter, if procur'd By others disaduantage? oh good God! Is this a brood of men? Men let them be, Worst are they of the generation. They shew a little tricksey modestie, Not to denie a craued curtesie! But when performance comes, they then declare (Nature will shew it selfe) what men they are. They are asham'd a little, but in triall Their temper bursteth forth to flat deniall. Then shall you heare their shamelesse Oratorieâ Pray who are you? are what at least to me. Why yeeld my loue to you? good sir attend, I am vnto my selfe the neerest friend. Touch them with faith and troth, they blush no whit: So that when no constraint inforceth it, They make some scruple; when it comes to th'pinch, Then at the proofe your hollow friend doth flinch. But what's my best course? shall I to him streight, And with him this his wrong expostulate? And ply him with harsh tearmes? but some may say, What good shall I procure my selfe that way? Yes much: I shall both chafe him, and giue ease To my grieu'd heart. Pam. Charinus, 'lesse God please To succour vs, I haue both thee and me Against my will vndone vnwarily. Cha. Vnwarily: is that word now thought on? Y'haue broke your promisd faith. Pam. As how, I pray? Cha. Seeke you againe with faire words to abuse me? Pam. What meanes this? Cha. After I said I lou'd her, You must needes like her too. Oh me accurst, That scantled out your dealing by mine owne! Pam. You are mistaken. Cha. Seem'd your content not full, Vnlesse you fool'd, and with false hope traind on A wretched louer? much good doe ye; take her. Pam. I take her? oh I perceiue thou knowst not. In what a gulfe of miserie I am plung'd: What pecke of troubles this my torturer Hath brought me to, by harkning to his counsell. Cha. No marle: he takes his president from you. Pam. You would not say this, if you fully knew Or me, or her I'ue set my fancie on. Cha. Yes, I doe know; you were at hot high words Late with your father; and haue angred him, Because he cannot make you marrie her. Pam. Nay, which discouers thou lesse knowst my griefe, This mariage neuer was prepar'd for me: Nor did now any force me to a wife. Cha. I know't your owne will forc'd you. Pam. Tarrie, yet thou knowst not all. Cha. I know thou'lt marrie her. Pam. Why doe you thus torment me? heare but this He neuer ceased to be vrgent on me, That I should tell my father I would marrie: To intreat, perswade, till he had drawne me to it. Cha. What man did this. Pam. This Dauus. Cha. Dauus? Pam. Dauus brings all things out of square. Cha. What the inducement? Pam. I nothing know, except this one thing onely, That I well see the Gods are much displeased With me, for listning to him. Cha. Did you thus Dauus? Dau. I did. Cha. Ha, what saist thou caitife? The gods giue thee a death suting thy doings Sirrha, but tell me; say that all his foes Had laid their heads together for a plot To yoake him to a wife, what stratagem Could they haue fram'd more speeding then this was? Dau. I am deceiu'd, but faint not. Cha. I, I know't. Dau. It thriu'd not this way, weele attempt some other. Vnlesse you iudge because at first we sped not, There's no meanes left vs to salue vp the mischiefe. Pam. Nay more, I well beleeue if thou watch for it, Of one thoult make me out a double marriage. Dau. I (Pamphilus) by reason of my bondage Owe you thus much: to doe, goe, night and day To indeauour all I may, with my liues hazard; For your aduantage: it is yet your part To beare with me, if things come crosse my hopes: My plots faile; yet I vse all carefulnesse: Your selfe else frame things wiselier, discharge me. Pam. I craue thou leaue me in that state thou fo?dst me; Dau. I will. Pam. But't must be streight. Dau. How now! hist, stay. Glyceriums doore did creake. Pam. That's nought to thee. Dau. I am a forging. Pam. How, is't now to forge. Dau. But I will giu't you fashion'd presently. Scen. 2. Enter Mysis. Mys. VVhere ere he be, Ile finde your Pamphilus And bring him with me streight: Meane while good heart vex not your selfe. Pam. Mysis? Mys. What's the matter? Oh, was't you Pamphilus? you are well met. Pam. What newes? Mys. My Mistresse praies you of all loue To come to her: she longs to speake with you. Pam. I am a forlorne wretch: the mischiefe spreads. That she and I should both be thus perplexed By meanes of thee? for I am therefore sent for Because she heares my wedding is prepared. Cha. From which how easily had you now bin quiet, Had he bin quiet? Dau. Yes, so, goe on: If of himselfe he be not vexd inough, Vrge him on further. Mys. I indeede tis that Does now afflict her. Pam. Mysis, I doe sweare By all the Gods vnto thee, I will neuer Forsake her: no, though I were sure thereby To vndergoe the whole worlds enmitie. I did desire her; haue obtaind her; see That we both iumpe in mindes, and qualitie. Farewell to all that seeke vs two to seuer: But death none takes her from me. Cha. I recouer. Pam. I doe desire (if't may be so borne vp) My father should not thinke I am the cause The marriage holds not: if that cannot be, Ile take the next course: that he may perceiue I crosse it. What kinde of man doost thinke me. Cha. Faith euery way as wretched as my selfe. Dau. I cast for helpe. Cha. I, thou hast a good heart. Dau. And will effect it for you. Pam. 'T must be now. Dau. Why, I ha't now. Cha. What is it? Dau. You mistake; It is for him, not you. Cha. I am content. Pam. Say, what wilt doe? Dau. I haue scarce day enough To finish it I feare: and thinke me not At leasure therefore now, to tell you it. But get y'hence both; you, now but hinder me. Pam. Ile visite her here. Dau. And you, whither you? Exit Pamphilus. Cha. Wilt thou I tell thee truth? Dau. Nay see, he makes a prologue to a tale. Cha. What doost for me? Dau. Oh impudent! is't not inough I giue thee Some houres; by putting off his marriage? Cha. Yet Dauusâ Dau. Well, what? Cha. That I may haue her.â Dau. Ridiculous! Cha. Yet if thou canst do oughtâ Come home to me. Dau. To what end should I come? I nothing haue to helpe thee. Cha. I but ifâ Dau. Well, I will come. Cha. If thou canst thinke of ought Ile be at home. Exit Charinus. Dau. Mysis, while I goe hence Stay here a little for me. Mys. To what end? Dau. Tis needfull now, thou do so. Mys. Make hast then. Dau. I will be here straightway againe with thee. Exit Dauus. Scen. 3. Mys. That no one holdeth any thing in certaine? Your helpe good Gods! I thought this Pamphilus Had bin my Mistresses firme, chiefest good; Tooke him to be her friend, her louer, husband; Ready at all essaies to stand to her: And yet what griefe sustaines she now through him? Hence sure more ill she reapes then good from him. But here comes Dauus. Enter Dauus. What's that prithee friend? the childe? Whither doost beare it? Scen. 4. Dau. Mysis, I neede thy readiest memorie and wit In this I goe about. Mys. What art to doe? Dau. Take the childe from me streight, &amp; lay it downe Before our doore. Mys. What on the bare ground pray? Dau. Take a few strewings from the altar thereâ And lay 'hem vnder. Mys. Why doost not thou thy selfe? Dau. That if perchance my Master vrge my oath Twas not my doing, I may safely sweare it. Mys. I vnderstand you: but pray tell me whence This now new tender conscience comes vpon thee? Dau. Stir you more quicke; that you may further know What tis I haue in hand. Oh Iupiter! Enter Chremes. Mys. What? Dau. The father of the bride is come on vs. I leaue the course which I at first intended. Mys. I know not what you talke on? Dau. My selfe too Will make as if I came from the right hand. Haue you a care now as occasion serues You marke my talke, and suit your words to mine. Mys. I vnderstand nothing you goe about: But if in any thing you neede my helpe Or see more then my selfe, I here will stay, That I may be no hindrance in your way. Exit Dauus. Scen. 5. Chr. Hauing prepared all in readinesse Was needfull to my Daughters marriage, I now returne to will 'hem send for her. But what is here? so helpe me God, a childe! Woman, laid you this childe here? Mys. Where is hee? Chr. Doost not answer me? Mys. Woes me, out of sight. Alas, Dauus has left me: and is gone. Enter Dauus. Dau. Faith of the Gods! What coile's yond' at the Market? What throng of wranglers braule there? and beside Corne beares excessiue price. I know not now What other words to vse. Mys. For Gods sake man Why left you me alone here? Dau. Hoida! what Deuice is this? you Mysis, whence this childe? Or who here laid it? Mys. Are you in your wits, To aske me that? Dau. Of whom else should I aske, That see none else here? Chr. I marle whence it is. Dau. Wolt tell me. Mys. Au! Dau. Come here, o' my right side. Mys. Th'art mad: did not your selfe? Dau. Looke thou beware Thou vtter not a word, but what I aske thee. Mys. D'yee threaten me? Dau. From whence is it? speake out. Mys. From you. Dau. Ha, ha, he, ist newes, if women Of your condition doe grow impudent? Chr. This maid belongs to th'Andrian, as I thinke. Dau. Seeme we such fitting persons to you, troe That you should play on vs? Chr. I came in time. Dau. Therefore with speede take you the childe away Hence from our doore: yet stay, see thou stirre not One inch out of this place. Mys. The Gods confound thee That me poore woman frightst thus. Dau. Do I speake to thee, or not? Mys. What would you? Dau. Askt thou still? Say, tell me whose childe tis thou hast laid here? Mys. Doe not you know? Dau. Talke not of what I know, But tell me that I aske. Mys. Tis of your house Dau. Whose, of vs? Mys. Pamphilus. Dau. Ha, what, Pamphilus? Mys. Ist not? Chr. I alwaies rightly shunn'd this match. Dau. Oh notable vile practise! Mys. Why exclaimst thou? Dau. Which childe did not my selfe see yesternight Brought late to you? Mys. Oh most audacious fellow Dau. 'Tis truth, I saw Canthara thicke stuft out. Mys. I thanke the Gods yet, that some Citie wiues Were present at the labour. Dau. She not knowes Him (I assure thee) for whose cause she plots this. She thinkes if Chremes see a child laid here, Heel'e not bestow his daughter: yes of truth, For this the rather. Chr. Faith but he will not though. Dau. Now therefore, for thy knowledge, take it hence Or I will tumble it in the high way, And further lay thee by it in the kennell. Mys. Thou certainly art drunke. Dau. One cunning pranke Treads on anothers heele. I heare it whisperd She's a free-borne Athenian. Chre. Ha! Dau. And that He shall be forc'd by law to marrie her. Mys. Why sir I pray you, is she not free-borne? Chr. I had almost vnawares iested my selfe Into a dangerous mischiefe. Dau. Who talkes here? Oh Chremes you are come in happy time. Pray listen sirâ Chr. I haue heard all already. Dau. How all say you? Chr. I, from the beginning all. Dau. Haue you pray heard it? see their villanies! Tis fit she were hence hurried to the racke. This is the man I talk'd of: doe not thinke You play your trickes on Dauus. Mys. Oh wretched mee! Indeede (good old Sir) I haue spoke no falshood. Chr. I know all to the full: but is your Master Simo within? Dau. Yes Sir. Exit Chremes. Mys. Roague hand me not. Troth if Glycerium know not of all thisâ Dau. Attend you foole, thou knowst not what is done: Tis the brides father: by no other meanes Could he be made to know what we would haue him. Mys. Why then you should haue told me on't. Dau. Doest thinke There no great difference, when a thing is carried The naturall way, and when premeditate. Scen. 6. Enter Crito. Crit. Tis told me Chrysis dwelt in this same street: Who rather chose heere leaudly to grow rich, Then in her Countrie honestly liue poore: She dead, the Law hath cast her state on me. But now I see some I may question: God saue you. Mys. Oh good God whom doe I see? Is not this Crito, Chrisis Cozen German? Tis he. Crit. Oh Mysis! you are well met. Mys. The Gods Prosper you Crito. Crit. Chrysis then isâwell? Mys. Yes truely she has left vs, to th'wide world. Crit. And you, what shift d'ye make? any thing well? Mys. We? faith e'en according to the prouerbe; Liue as we can, since cannot as we would. Crit. Glyceriumâwhat, hath she yet found her parents? Mys. I would she had. Crit. What not yet? I came hither In an vnluckie houre: for had I knowne it I sure would ne'er haue stirr'd a foot this way. She alwaies was both said and deem'd her sister And holds all that was hers: now for me then To follow law suits being here a stranger, How easie and commodious 'tmay be Rife precedents of other men do warne me. Besides, I iudge by this she has got her selfe Some friend and patron: for when she came thence She had well-neere attained to ripe yeeres Men will cry out I am a sycophant, A begger laying claime to others right: Withall, my selfe list not impouerish her: Mys. Good Crito, you still hold your ancient course. Crit. Bring me vnto her, since I am come hither, I may at least yet see her. Mys. Yes I will. Dau. Ile follow: yet the old man shall not see me. Mysis and Crito enter Glyceriums house and Dauus followes them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. Scen. 1. Enter Chremes and Simo out of Simoes house. Chr. Simo enough, I haue enough tride your friendship; Venturd sufficient hazard: pray now leaue Intreating. Whilst I seeke to pleasure you I almost trifled my childes life away. Sim. Nay, but I earnestly begge and craue Chremes, This your good turne now late begun in words You would in deedes make vp. Chr. Note how vniust You grow, through earnestnesse to worke your aimes: You nor consider bounds in curtesies, Nor yet what tis you craue: for if you did, Yould cease to load me with these iniuries. Sim. What iniuries? Chr. Oh, doe you question them? You wrought me to bestow my onely childe To one intangled in a strangers loue: A wilde yong youth abhorring marriage: To most sure discord, marriage as ensure; That by her griefe and sorrow I might phisicke Your riotous sonne: this y'obtain'd: I went on, Whil'st things permitted: now that the case not brooks it, You must brooke my deniall. Tis affirmd This stranger is free borne; hath a childe by him: Leaue troubling vs. Sim. By all the Gods I beg You would not bend your minde to trust these people, Whose best aduantage tis, to make him worst. These things are onely feign'd and fashioned To dash the wedding: take away the cause Moues them to this, they'll straightway leaue contriuing. Chr. Y'are wide: My selfe saw a maide scolding here With Dauus. Sim. I know't. Chr. I but this was done In good sad earnest; neither of them both Knowing that I was neere. Sim. I doe beleeue it: And Dauus late told me it would be so. I know not how I did forget to tell you, As I had meant. Scen. 2. Enter Dauus out of Glyceriums house. Dau. I will you now rest quietâ Chr. See, here's Dauus. Sim. Whence comes he? Dau. Through my furthrance and this guests. Sim. What new mischiefe? Dau. Man, time, comming fitter, I neuer saw. Sim. Who ist, the roague so praises? Dau. All's now secure. Sim. Cease I to speake to him? Dau. My Master! what's my course? Dau. Oh Simo, oh our Chremes, All things are now in readinesse within. Sim. Th'hast lookt too't well. Dau. When you please, send for her. Sim. Tis very well; but that course now here failes vs. But may I know, what thou hadst there to doe? Dau. I Sir. Sim. I, Sir. Dau. Me meane you? Sim. Yes, meane thee. Dau. I went in but nowâ Sim. As if I ask't thee, when? Dau. Together with your sonne. Sim. Is my sonne there? I wretch am set o'th racke. Diddst not hangman Tell me, they were at deadly oddes together? Dau. They are. Sim. What does he there then? Chr. Hee? what thinkst? I warrant railing at her. Dau. Nay but Chremes Ile tell you now of a strange accident. I know not what old man is newly come, Note him, a man both confident and wise; When you shall see him, you'l much value him. A graue austerity rests on his face; And in his words dwell faith. Sim. What newes bring'st thou? Dau. No other, then I heard that man report. Sim. And what doo's he report? Dau. That he doo's know Glycerium here, a free Athenian borne. Sim. Hoe Dromo, Dromo. Enter Dromo. Dro. What's the matter? Sim. Dromo. Dau. Heare me. Sim. If thou speakest one word moreâDromo. Dau. I doe beseech you heare me. Dro. What would y'haue? Sim. Hoist in this fellow here, hence speedily. Dro. Whom? Sim. Dauus. Dau. Why? Sim. For it is my pleasure. Away with him I say. Dau. What haue I done? Sim. In with him. Dau. If you shall finde I haue ly'de In any thing, then kill me. Sim. Ile heare nothing. Ile streightway put thee into motion. Dau. Though that I said the truth? Sim. Thoughâsee you He be kept bound; and heare you, bound all foure. Ile shew thee, what tis to abuse a Master, If I but liue this day: and teach the other What tis to crosse a father. Exit Dromo with Dauus. Chr. Oh, I pray you rage not so much. Sim. Chremes doost not, seeing How vnkindely he deales with me, pittie me? That I should toyle and care for such a sonne? But Pamphilus you, come you out Pamphilus: Doth any shame possesse thee? Scen. 3. Enter Pamphilus. Pam. VVho cald me? I am lost, it is my father. Sim. What saist now? Thou of allâ Chr. Oh, rather goe to th'point man: And spare ill speaking. Sim. As if any thing Can be spoke ill inough of such a one? But Sirrha say, is your Glycerium now Free borne of Athens? Pam. So they say of her. Sim. Doe they say so? Monstrous audaciousnesse! Considers he his words? grieues at his deedes? Or shewes his colour any note of shame? That he should be of such deboshed manners, That cleare beyond all precedent of freemen, Against the forme of law, in opposition Of me his father, he should bend to haue her Though't reach to th'highest pitch of infamie? Pam. Oh me most wretched! Sim. Doost thou now at length Perceiue that Pamphilus? that word of old Of old that word then truely fitted thee, When first thou setst thy heart to please thy selfe; Though at what rate soeuer compassed. But wherefore doe I thus? why vex my soule? Why waste my selfe away? why doe I grieue My old and fainting age with his youths follies? Shall I indure the pennance of his faultings? No, let him haue her; I, God speede him well; Yes, let him keepe with her. Pam. Oh my fatherâ Sim. Why call'st me father? as if thou hadst neede Of me to be thy father? a house, wife, Children are had maugre thy fathers will: Fellowes are hir'd shall beare her vp freeborne. Y'haue got the mast'rie. Pam. I beseech you father, May I haue leaue to vtter a few words. Sim. What wilt say to me? Chr. Vet heare him Simo. Sim. I heare him: what ist Chremes I should heare him? Chr. Permit him tell you. Sim. Well, tell he: I permit Pam. I doe confesse I loue this woman here: If it be faultie, I confesse that too. Further I yeeld me vp to your full pleasure, Lay any taske, any command vpon me. Will you I marrie that, leaue this? I will Indure it as I may. But this one thing I begge of you, that you would not imagine That this old man is by my meanes brought in: Suffer me cleare my selfe, and fetch him hither Into your presence Sim. Fetch him. Pam. Let mee pray. Chr. He craues but reason, grant it. Pam. I pray sir. Exit Pamphilus. Sim. Well, I doe: I wish Chremes ought be proued, So that I finde he doos not iuggle with me. Chr. Sleight accusation in a sonnes offence Sufficeth for a father. Scen. 4. Enter Crito and Pamphilus. Crit. Cease to intreat. Each of the reasons you haue vs'd, perswade me To your request: either your owne selfe cause, Or for it is a truth, or cause I wish All furtherance vnto Glycerium. Chr. Doe I not see Crito of Andros there? Tis he. Crito you are here well met: You haue bin long a stranger here: what chance Hath brought you now to Athens. Crit. An occasion. But is this Simo? Chr. Yes. Sim. Aske you for me? D'yee heare sir, is it you that doe affirme Glycerium to be free borne of Athens? Crit. Are you one, doe denie it? Sim. Is't eene so? Come you so well prepared too? Crit. Wherefore? Sim. Doost thou vse question? thinkst thou to escape Fairely thus of with't? seekest thou to worke on The easie natures of vnguided youth, Peruerting our well nurtur'd children? Winning their hearts with fawning promises. And this, in Athens. Crit. Are you in your wits? Sim. And harlot-loues knit'st vp in marriage? Chr. If you knew this man Simo thoroughly, You would not iudge so: he is an honest man. Sim. An honest man; to come iumpe in th'instant Of closing hands, and nere seene here before? Chremes, may such a man be credited? Pam. If I not doubted to displease my father I easily could prompt him to that point. Sim. Cauelling sycophantâ Crit. How? Chr. Forbeare Crito; It is his temper. Crit. Let him regard his temper: If he will vent his pleasure vpon me He shall be forc'd to heare what will displease him. Trouble I his matters? or yet care for 'hem? Cannot you beare your owne ils patiently? For my part, it may instantly be knowne Whether 't be false or true, you heard me say A certaine man of Athens, now long since Shiprackt at sea, was cast on Andros Isle; And with him this Glycerium, then a childe: He being poore had harbour at the house Of Chrysis father. Sim. He begins a tale. Chr. Pray giue him leaue. Crit. Does he disturbe me thus? He that entertaind him was my kinsman: Of him I then heard, that this shipwrack'd man Was an Athenian. Chr. Pray, what was his name? Crit. His name so sodainly? PhaâPha-nia. Chr. Oh, my heart! Crit. Yes sure, I thinke twas Phania. This I well know, he nam'd himselfe of Ramnos. Chr. O Iupiter! Crit. A many moe in Andros Then heard it. Chr. I beseech the Gods, it proue According to my hopes: but pray you Crito, What said he of the childe, that twas his owne? Crit. No. Chr. Whose then? Crit. The daughter of his brother. Chr. Tis certainly mine owne. Crit. What doe you say? Sim. What say you? Pam. Pamphilus giue heed to this. Sim. Why thinke you so? Chr. That Phania was my brother. Sim. I knew him well, and know that he was so. Chr. He flying hence to auoid the rage of warre, Trauaild toward Asia in pursuit of me; And feard withall to leaue the childe behinde: Since whence, now I heare the first newes of him. Pam. I scarcely feele my selfe: my mind's so tost Twixt feare, and hope, and ioy, and wondring, At this so great, so sodaine happinesse. Sim. In truth I much reioyce, she is sound yours. Pam. I doe beleeue you father. Chr. But there rests One scruple yet, which somewhat troubles me. Pa. You are worthy now of hate, with these your scruples Crit. What is't? Chr. The name agrees not. Crit. She had sure Another being young. Chr. What was it Crito? Canst thou remember? Crit. I am thinking on't. Pam. Shall I permit his tardie memorie To slacken my ioyes current, being able Herein to giue my selfe a remedie? No, I will not: harke you hither Chremes; The name you doubt of is Pasibula. Crit. That's it. Chr. Tis right. Pam. I heard it of her selfe At least a thousand times. Sim. I beleeue Chremes, You thinke we all ioy at it. Chr. As may the Gods Assist me, I doe thinke so. Pam. What rests father? Sim. The case it selfe now reconcileth vs. Pam. Oh my most louing father: and you Chremes Change nothing in the wife I now possesse? Chr. The cause is iust, your father so agreeing. Pam. Thus muchâ Sim. Yea marrieâ Chr. Her dowre Pamphilus I make ten talents. Pam. I accept of it. Chr. Ile forthwith see my daughter: Crito, pray Goe with me; for I thinke she knowes me not. Sim. Why cause you not your wife be brought to vs? Pam. You warne me well, Ile eene giue Dauus charg ont. Sim. He cannot now effect it. Pam. Pray why so? Sim. Has more and greater charge vpon himselfe. Pam. What? Sim. Hee's bound. Pam. Hee's not bound rightly father. Sim. No; I did will him be bound otherwise. Pam. Pray order he be loosd. Sim. Well, be it so. Pam. But good sir, haste. Sim. Ile in and see it done. Exit Simo. Pam. Oh happie, oh this prosperous blessed day. Scen. 5. Enter Charinus. Cha. I come to see how Pamphilus speeds, and loe. Pam. Some man perhaps may think I feed on dreames: But now I please to thinke all reall truth. I on this ground iudge the Gods liues eternall, Because their pleasure's certainly their owne. For I my selfe haue gaind immortall state, If with this ioy no griefe ere intermeddle. But who might I now wish especially Here at this time, to tell the tidings to? Enter Dauus. Cha. What ioy is that he talkes of? Pam. I now see Dauus our man: there is no liuing one, I rather would haue had. I know he will Full truely ioy in the true ioy I feele. Scen. 6. Dau. VVhere is this Pamphilus trow? Pam. Dauus Dau. Who's that? Pam. Tis I. Dau. Oh Pamphilus! Pam. Thou knowest not what has befall'n me? Dau. True: yet know, what has chanc'd me. Pam. And so do I. Dau. Why this happes iust oth'fashion, That you my ill lucke learne, ere I your good. Pam. Glycerium hath found out her parents. Dau. Good. Cha. How's that? Pam. Her father our chiefe friend. Dau. Who ist? Pam. Chremes. Dau. Oh braue! Pam. Nor now is any stay, But that I take her home forthwith to wife. Cha. Dreames he trow, of things he desires waking? Pam. Now Dauus, for the child? Dau. Leaue of I pray: The gods sure purpose him their minion. Cha. I am a made man, if these things be true Ile speake to'hem. Pam. Oh Charinus, Thou com'st in a fit time. Cha. Oh happie newes. Pam. Hast heard ont then? Cha. Yes all: pray thinke on me, Now in the height of your felicitie. Chremes is now your owne, and I do know Hele yeeld to any thing you motion. Pam. I mind it. But 't would now be ouer-long Heere to attend, till he come forth to vs. Follow me in; he's with Glycerium. Get you home Dauus, hasten; and procure Some that may beare her hence: why stand'st thou so? Why staiest thou still? Dau. Sir Ile go presently. Exeunt Pamphilus, and Charinus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue by Dauus. Addition, by way of paraphrase on Dauus last words in the Scene. I note you sit with kind attention bent, As pleasd with what hath passed; and expect The further issue of our argument; And on the mariage now your minds reflect. We pray you cease such expectation; For we haue done: the bride you do conceiue But newly brought to bed; night comming on Women shall beare her hence, at Simoes leaue. Chremes hs younger daughter Philumen Charinus gets, at sure of Pamphilus. Crito of Andros, who has beene the meane The long lost child should be discouerd thus, What course he now shall take to obtaine his right in Chrysis goods, I here not mention will; Nor indeede can I: I haue no insight In law points, triable at Mars his hill. Yet knowing Chremes nature tractable, Seeing withall he hath dealt liberally In portion, so that Pamphilus is able To beare the losse, though common honestie Did not exact it. I not doubt they will Vse the poore stranger well. Me you haue seene here Venture to binding, grinding in the Mill: That fell on me, this was approaching neare. I purpose further in their ioy to sue My present freedome: Pamphilus loue I haue; Glyceriums also; both I thinke of due: My Masters chafe is off I onely craue Your furtherance in the matter; which if gaind, I haue good hope: for I haue heard it sed By men ith' PericlÃ¦an lawes well read, If I make you my friends, my sute's obtaind: For they haue told me my discharge now stands not vpon whispering voyces; but clapt hands. Finis Andria.</field>
