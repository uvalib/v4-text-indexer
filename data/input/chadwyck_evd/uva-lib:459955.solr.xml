      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, A Country Justice's Hall, adorn'd with Scutcheons and Stags Horns. Enter Steward, Squire, Kitty, Dock, and others in Country Habits. Steward. So, you are ready in your Parts, and in your Dress too, I see; your own best Cloaths do the Business. Sure never was Play and Actors so suited. Come, range your selves before me, Women on the Right, and Men on the Left. Squire Thomas, you make a good Figure. [The Actors range themselves. Squire Thom. Ay, thanks to Barnaby's Sunday Cloaths; but call me Thomas Filbert, as I am in the Play. Steward. Chear up, Daughter, and make Kitty Carrot the shining Part: Squire Thomas is to be in Love with you to Night, Girl. Kitty. Ay, I have felt Squire Thomas's Love to my Cost. I have little Stomach to play, in the Condition he hath put me into. [Aside. Steward. Jonas Dock, dost thou remember thy Name? Dock. My Name? Jo—Jo—Jonas. No— that was the Name my Godfathers gave me. My Play Name is Timothy Pea—Pea— Peascod; ay, Peascod—and am to be shot for a Deserter.— Steward. And you, Dolly? Dolly. An't please ye, I am Dorcas, Peascod's Sister, and am to be with Child, as it were. 1st Country-m. And I am to take her up, as it were—I am the Constable. 2d Country-m. And I am to see Tim shot, as it were—I am the Corporal. Steward. But what is become of our Sergeant? Dorcas. Why Peter Nettle, Peter, Peter. [Enter Nettle.] Nettle. These Stockings of Susan's cost a woundy deal of pains the pulling on: But what's a Sergeant without red Stockings? Dock. I'll dress thee, Peter, I'll dress thee. Here, stand still, I must twist thy Neckcloth; I would make thee hold up thy Head, and have a ruddy Complexion; but prithee don't look black in the Face, Man. [Twisting his Neckcloth.] Thou must look fierce and dreadful. [Making Whiskers with a Cork.] But what shall we do for a Grenadier's Cap? Steward. Fetch the Leathern Bucket that hangs in the Bellfry; that is curiously painted before, and will make a Figure. Nettle. No, no, I have what's worth twenty on't: The Pope's Mitre, that my Master Sir Roger seiz'd, when they would have burnt him at our Market Town. Steward. So, now let every body withdraw, and prepare to begin the Play. [Exeunt Actors.] My Daughter debauched! and by that Booby Squire! Well, perhaps the Conduct of this Play may retrieve her Folly, and preserve her Reputation. Poor Girl! I cannot forget thy Tears. [Enter Sir Roger.] Sir Roger. Look ye, Steward, don't tell me you can't bring them in. I will have a Ghost; nay, I will have a Competence of Ghosts. What, shall our Neighbours think we are not able to make a Ghost? A Play without a Ghost is like, is like,—igad it is like nothing. Steward. Sir, be satisfied; you shall have Ghosts. Sir Roger. And is the Play as I order'd it, both a Tragedy and a Comedy? I would have it a Pastoral too: and if you could make it a Farce, so much the better—and what if you crown'd all with a Spice of your Opera? You know my Neighbours never saw a Play before; and d'ye see, I would shew them all sorts of Plays under one. Steward. Sir Roger, it is contrived for that very purpose. [Enter two Justices.] Sir Roger. Neighbours, you are welcome. Is not this Steward of mine a pure ingenious Fellow now, to make such a Play for us these Christmas Holidays. [Exit Steward bowing.] —A rare Headpiece! He has it here, i faith. [Pointing to his own Head.] But indeed, I gave him the Hint.—To see now what Contrivance some Folks have! We have so fitted the Parts to my Tenants, that ev'ry Man talks in his own way!—and then we have made just three Justices in the Play, to be play'd by us three Justices of the Quorum. 1st Justice. Zooks!—so it is;—main Ingenious.—And can we sit and smoke at the same time we act? Sir Roger. Ay, ay,—we have but three or four Words to say,—and may drink and be good Company in Peace and Silence all the while after. 2d Justice. But how shall we know when we are to say these same Words? Sir Roger. This shall be the Signal— when I set down the Tankard, then speak you, Sir Humphry,—and when Sir Humphry sets down the Tankard, speak you, Squire Statute. 1st Justice. Ah, Sir Roger, you are old Dog at these things. 2d Justice. To be sure. Sir Roger. Why Neighbours, you know, Experience, Experience—I remember your Harts and your Bettertons—But then to see your Othello, Neighbours,—how he would rave and roar, about a foolish flower'd Handkerchief! —and then he would groul so manfully,—and he would put out the Light, and put the Light out so cleverly! but hush —the Prologue, the Prologue. [They seat themselves with much Ceremony at the Table, on which are Pipes and Tobacco, and a large Silver Tankard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE, Spoken by Mr. Pinkethman. The Entertainment of this Night—or Day, This Something, or this Nothing of a Play, Which strives to please all Palates at a time, With Ghosts and Men, Songs, Dances, Prose and Rhime, This Comick Story, or this Tragick Jest, May make you laugh, or cry, as you like best; May exercise your Good, or your Ill-nature, Move with Distress, or tickle you with Satyr. All must be pleas'd too with their Parts, we think: Our Maids have Sweethearts, and their Worships drink. Criticks, we know, by antient Rules may maul it; But sure Gallants must like—the What d'ye call it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Sir Roger, Sir Humphry, Justice Statute, Constable, Filbert, Sergeant, Kitty, Dorcas, Grandmother, Aunt. Sir Roger. Here, Thomas Filbert, answer to your Name, Dorcas hath sworn to you she owes her Shame: Or wed her strait, or else you're sent afar, To serve his Gracious Majesty in War. Filbert. 'Tis false, 'tis false—I scorn thy odious Touch. [Pushing Dorcas from him. Dorcas. When their turn's serv'd, all Men will do as much. Kitty. Oh, good your Worships, ease a wretched Maid. To the right Father let the Child be laid. Art thou not perjur'd?—Mark his harmless Look. How canst thou, Dorcas, kiss the Bible Book? Hast thou no Conscience, dost not fear Old Nick? Sure sure the Ground will ope, and take thee Quick. Sergeant. Zooks! never wed, 'tis safer much to roam; For what is War abroad to War at home? Who wou'd not sooner bravely risque his Life; For what's a Cannon to a scolding Wife? Filbert. Well, if I must, I must,—I hate the Wench, I'll bear a Musquet then against the French. From Door to Door I'd sooner whine and beg, Both Arms shot off, and on a wooden Leg, Than marry such a Trapes—No, no, I'll not: —Thou wilt too late repent, when I am shot. But, Kitty, why dost cry?— Grandmother. —Stay, Justice, stay: Ah, little did I think to see this Day! Must Grandson Filbert to the Wars be prest? Alack! I knew him when he suck'd the Breast, Taught him his Catechism, the Fescue held, And join'd his Letters, when the Bantling Spell'd. His loving Mother left him to my Care. Fine Child, as like his Dad as he could stare! Come Candlemas, nine Years ago she dy'd, And now lies buried by the Yew-tree's side. Aunt. O Tyrant Justices! have you forgot How my poor Brother was in Flanders shot? You press'd my Brother—he shall walk in White, He shall—and shake your Curtains ev'ry Night. What though a paultry Hare he rashly kill'd, That cross'd the Furrows while he plough'd the Field? You sent him o'er the Hills and far away; Left his old Mother to the Parish Pay, With whom he shar'd his Ten Pence ev'ry Day. Wat kill'd a Bird, was from his Farm turn'd out; You took the Law of Thomas for a Trout: You ruin'd my poor Uncle at the Sizes, And made him pay nine Pounds for Nisiprises. Now will you press my harmless Nephew too? Ah, what has Conscience with the Rich to do! [Sir Roger takes up the Tankard. —Though in my Hand no Silver Tankard shine, Nor my dry Lip is dy'd with Claret Wine, Yet I can sleep in Peace— Sir Roger. [After having drunk. —Woman forbear. Sir Humphry. [Drinking. The Man's within the Act— Justice Statute. [Drinking also. —The Law is clear. Sergeant. Haste, let their Worships Orders be obey'd. Kitty. [Kneeling. Behold how low you have reduc'd a Maid. Thus to your Worships on my Knees I sue, (A Posture never known but in the Pew) If we can Money for our Taxes find, Take that—but ah! our Sweethearts leave behind. To Trade so barb'rous he was never bred, The Blood of Vermine all the Blood he shed: How should he, harmless Youth, how should he then Who kill'd but Poulcats, learn to murder Men? Dorcas. O Thomas, Thomas! hazard not thy Life; By all that's good, I'll make a loving Wife: I'll prove a true Pains-taker Day and Night, I'll spin and card, and keep our Children tight. I can knit Stockings, you can thatch a Barn; If you earn Ten-pence, I my Groat can earn. How shall I weep to hear this Infant cry? [Her Hand on her Belly. He'll have no Father—and no Husband I. Kitty. Hold, Thomas, hold, nor hear that shameless Witch: I can sow Plain-work, I can darn and stitch; I can bear sultry Days and frosty Weather: Yes, yes, my Thomas, we will go together; Beyond the Seas together will we go, In Camps together, as at Harvest, glow. This Arm shall be a Bolster for thy Head, I'll fetch clean Straw to make my Soldier's Bed; There, while thou sleep'st, my Apron o'er thee hold, Or with it patch thy Tent against the Cold. Pigs in hard Rains I've watch'd, and shall I do That for the Pigs, I would not bear for you? Filbert. Oh, Kitty, Kitty, canst thou quit the Rake, And leave these Meadows for thy Sweetheart's sake? Canst thou so many gallant Soldiers see, And Captains and Lieutenants slight for me? Say, canst thou hear the Guns, and never shake, Nor start at Oaths that make a Christian quake? Canst thou bear Hunger, canst thou march and toil A long long Way, a thousand thousand Mile? And when thy Tom's blown up, or shot away, Then-canst thou starve?-they'l cheat thee of my Pay. Sir Roger. [Drinking. Take out that Wench— Sir Humphry. [Drinking. —But give her Pennance meet. Justice Statute. [Drinking also. I'll see her stand—next Sunday—in a Sheet. Dorcas. Ah! why does Nature give us so much Cause To make kind-hearted Lasses break the Laws? Why should hard Laws kind-hearted Lasses bind, When too soft Nature draws us after Kind? SCENE II. Sir Roger, Sir Humphry, Justice Statute, Filbert, Sergeant, Kitty, Grandmother, Aunt, Soldier. Soldier. Sergeant, the Captain to your Quarters sent; To ev'ry Alehouse in the Town I went. Our Corp'ral now has the Deserter found; The Men are all drawn out, the Pris'ner bound. Sergeant. [To Filbert. Come, Soldier, come— Kitty. —Ah! take me, take me too. Grandmother. Stay, forward Wench;— Aunt. —What would the Creature do? This Week thy Mother means to wash and brew. Kitty. Brew then she may her self, or wash, or bake; I'd leave ten Mothers for one Sweetheart's sake. O Justice most unjust!— Filbert. —O Tyranny! Kitty. How can I part?— Filbert. —Alas! and how can I? Kitty. O rueful Day!— Filbert. —Rueful indeed, I trow. Kitty. O Woeful Day!— Filbert. —A Day indeed of Woe! Kitty. When Gentlefolks their Sweethearts leave behind, They can write Letters, and say something kind; But how shall Filbert unto me endite, When neither I can read, nor he can write? Yet, Justices, permit us e'er we part To break this Ninepence, as you've broke our Heart. Filbert. [Breaking the Ninepence. As this divides, thus are we torn in twain. Kitty. [Joining the Pieces. And as this meets, thus may we meet again. [She is drawn away on one Side of the Stage by Aunt and Grandmother. Yet one Look more— Filbert.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Field. Timothy Peascod bound; Corporal, Soldiers, and Countrymen. Corporal. Stand off there, Countrymen; and you, the Guard, Keep close your Pris'ner—see that all's prepar'd. Prime all your Firelocks—fasten well the Stake. Peascod. 'Tis too much, too much Trouble for my sake. O Fellow-Soldiers, Countrymen and Friends, Be warn'd by me to shun untimely Ends: For Evil Courses am I brought to Shame, And from my Soul I do repent the same. Oft my kind Grannam told me—Tim, take warning, Be good—and say thy Pray'rs—and mind thy Learning. But I, sad Wretch, went on from Crime to Crime; I play'd at Nine-pins first in Sermon time: I rob'd the Parson's Orchard next; and then (For which I pray Forgiveness) stole—a Hen. When I was press'd, I told them the first Day I wanted Heart to fight, so ran away; [Attempts to run off, but is prevented. For which behold I die. 'Tis a plain Case, 'Twas all a Judgment for my Want of Grace. [The Soldiers prime, with their Muskets towards him. —Hold, hold, my Friends; nay, hold, hold, hold, I pray; They may go off—and I have more to say. I. Countryman. Come, 'tis no time to talk.— II. Countryman. —Repent thine Ill, And Pray in this good Book.— [Gives him a Book. Peascod. —I will, I will. Lend me thy Handkercher—The Pilgrim's Pro— [Reads and weeps. (I cannot see for Tears) Pro—Progress—Oh! —The Pilgrim's Progress—Eighth—Edi—ti—on Lon-don—Prin-ted—for—Ni-cho-las Bod-ding-ton: With new Ad—di—tions never made before. —Oh! 'tis so moving, I can read no more. [Drops the Book. SCENE II. Peascod, Corporal, Soldiers, Countrymen, Sergeant, Filbert. Sergeant. What Whining's this?—Boys, see your Guns well ramm'd You Dog, die like a Soldier—and be damn'd. Filbert. My Friend in Ropes!— Peascod. —I should not thus be bound, If I had Means, and could but raise five Pound. The cruel Corp'ral whisper'd in my Ear, Five Pounds, if rightly tipt, would set me clear. Filbert. Here—Peascod, take my Pouch—'tis all I own. (For what is Means and Life when Kitty's gone!) 'Tis my Press Money—can this Silver fail? 'Tis all except one Sixpence spent in Ale. This had a Ring for Kitty's Finger bought, Kitty on me had by that Token thought. But for thy Life, poor Tim, if this can do't; Take it, with all my Soul—thou'rt welcome to't. [Offers him his Purse. I. Countryman. And take my Fourteen Pence— II. Countryman. —And my Cramp-ring. Would, for thy sake, it were a better Thing. III. Countryman. And Master Sergeant, take my Box of Copper. IV. Countryman. And my Wife's Thimble.— V. Countryman. —And this 'Bacco-stopper. Sergeant. No Bribes. Take back your Things-I'll have them not. Peascod. Oh! must I die?— Chorus of Countrymen. —Oh! must poor Tim be shot! Peascod. But let me kiss thee first— [Embracing Filbert. SCENE III. Peascod, Corporal, Soldiers, Countrymen, Sergeant, Filbert, Dorcas. Dorcas. —Ah, Brother Tim, Why these close Hugs? I owe my Shame to him. He scorns me now, he leaves me in the Lurch; In a white Sheet poor I must stand at Church. O marry me—[To Filbert.] Thy Sister is with Child. [To Tim. And he, 'twas he my tender Heart beguil'd. Peascod. Could'st thou do this? couldst thou— [In anger to Filbert. Sergeant. —Draw out the Men: Quick to the Stake; you must be dead by Ten. Dorcas. Be dead! must Tim be dead?— Peascod. —He must—he must. Dorcas. Ah! I shall sink downright; my Heart will burst. —Hold, Sergeant, hold—yet e'er you sing the Psalms, Ah! let me ease my Conscience of its Qualms. O Brother, Brother! Filbert still is true. I fouly wrong'd him—do, forgive me, do. [To Filb. The Squire betray'd me; nay,—and what is worse, Brib'd me with two Gold Guineas in this Purse, To swear the Child to Filbert.— Peascod. —What a Jew My Sister is!—Do, Tom, forgive her, do. [To Filb. Filbert. [Kisses Dorcas. But see thy base-born Child, thy Babe of Shame, Who left by thee, upon our Parish came; Comes for thy Blessing.— SCENE IV. Peascod, Corporal, Soldiers, Countrymen, Sergeant, Filbert, Dorcas, Joyce. Peascod. —Oh! my Sins of Youth! Why on the Haycock didst thou tempt me, Ruth? O save me, Sergeant;—how shall I comply? I love my Daughter so—I cannot die. Joyce. Must Father die! and I be left forlorn? A lack a day! that ever Joyce was born! No Grandsire in his Arms e'er dandled me, And no fond Mother danc'd me on her Knee. They said, if ever Father got his Pay, I should have Two-pence ev'ry Market-day. Peascod. Poor Child; hang Sorrow, and cast Care behind thee, The Parish by this Badge is bound to find thee. [Pointing to the Badge on her Arm. Joyce. The Parish finds indeed—but our Church-Wardens Feast on the Silver, and give us the Farthings. Then my School-Mistress, like a Vixen Turk, Maintains her lazy Husband by our Work: Many long tedious Days I've Worsted spun; She grudg'd me Victuals when my Task was done. Heav'n send me a good Service! for I now Am big enough to wash, or milk a Cow. Peascod. O that I had by Charity been bred! I then had been much better taught—than fed. Instead of keeping Nets against the Law, I might have learnt Accounts, and sung Sol—fa. Farewell, my Child; spin on, and mind thy Book, And send thee store of Grace therein to look. Take Warning by thy shameless Aunt; lest thou Shouldst o'er thy Bastard weep—as I do now. Mark my last Words—an honest Living get; Beware of Papishes, and learn to knit. [Dorcas leads out Joyce sobbing and crying. SCENE V. Peascod, Corporal, Soldiers, Countrymen, Sergeant, Filbert. Filbert. Let's drink before we part—for Sorrow's dry. To Tim's safe Passage.— [Takes out a Brandy-bottle, and drinks. I. Countryman. —I'll drink too. II. Countryman. —And I. Peascod. Stay, let me pledge—'tis my last earthly Liquor. [Drinks. —When I am dead-you'll bind my Grave with Wicker. [They lead him to the Stake. I. Countryman. He was a special Ploughman— [Sighing. II. Countryman. —Harrow'd well! III. Countryman. And at our Maypole ever bore the Bell! Peascod. Say, is it fitting in this very Field, Where I so oft have reap'd, so oft have till'd; This Field, where from my Youth I've been a Carter, I, in this Field, should die for a Deserter? Filbert. 'Tis hard, 'tis wond'rous hard!— Sergeant. —Zooks, here's a Pother. Strip him; I'd stay no longer for my Brother. Peascod. [Distributing his Things among his Friends. Take you my 'Bacco Box—my Neckcloth, you. To our kind Vicar send this Bottle-Skrew. But wear these Breeches, Tom; they're quite bran-new. Filbert. Farewell— I. Countryman. —B'ye, Tim.— II. Countryman. —B'ye, Tim. III. Countryman. —Adieu. IV. Countryman. —Adieu. [They all take their Leaves of Peascod by shaking Hands with him. SCENE VI. Peascod, Corporal, Soldiers, Countrymen, Sergeant, Filbert, to them a Soldier in great haste. Soldier. Hold—why so furious, Sergeant? by your Leave, Untye the Pris'ner—See, here's a Reprieve. [Shows a Paper. Chorus of Countrymen. [Huzzaing. A Reprieve, a Reprieve, a Reprieve. [Peascod is unty'd, and embraces his Friends. SCENE VII. Peascod, Corporal, Soldiers, Countrymen, Sergeant, Filbert, Constable. Constable. Friends, reprehend him, reprehend him there. Sergeant. For what?— Constable. —For stealing Gaffer Gap's gray Mare. [They seize the Sergeant. Peascod. Why, heark ye, heark ye, Friend; you'll go to Pot. Would you be rather hang'd—hah!—hang'd or shot? Sergeant. Nay, hold, hold, hold— Peascod. —Not if you were my Brother. Why, Friend, should you not hang as well's Another? Constable. Thus said Sir John—the Law must take its course; 'Tis Law that he may 'scape who steals a Horse. But (said Sir John) the Statutes all declare, The Man shall sure be hang'd—that steals a Mare. Peascod. [To the Sergeant. Ay—right—he shall be hang'd that steals a Mare. He shall be hang'd—that's certain; and good Cause. A rare good Sentence this—how is't?—the Laws No—not the Laws—the Statutes all declare, The Man that steals a Mare shall sure—be—hang'd No, no—he shall be hang'd that steals a Mare. [Exit Sergeant guarded, Countrymen, &amp;c. huzzaing after him. SCENE VIII. Kitty with her Hair loose, Grandmother, Aunt, Haymakers, Chorus of Sighs and Groans. Kitty. Dear happy Fields, farewell; ye Flocks, and you Sweet Meadows, glitt'ring with the pearly Dew: And thou, my Rake, Companion of my Cares, Giv'n by my Mother in my younger Years: With thee the Toils of full eight Springs have known, 'Tis to thy Help I owe this Hat and Gown; On thee I've lean'd, forgetful of my Work, While Tom gaz'd on me, propt upon his Fork: Farewel, farewel; for all thy Task is o'er, Kitty shall want thy Service now no more. [Flings away the Rake. Chorus of Sighs and Groans. Ah—O!—Sure never was the like before! Kitty. Happy the Maid, whose Sweetheart never hears The Soldier's Drum, nor Writ of Justice fears. Our Bans thrice bid! and for our Wedding Day My Kerchief bought! then press'd then forc'd away! Chorus of Sighs and Groans. Ah! O! poor Soul! alack! and well a day! Kitty. You, Bess, still reap with Harry by your Side; You, Jenny, shall next Sunday be a Bride: But I forlorn!—This Ballad shews my Care; [Gives Susan a Ballad. Take this sad Ballad, which I bought at Fair: Susan can sing—do you the Burthen bear. A BALLAD. [Susan.] 1. 'Twas when the Seas were roaring With hollow Blasts of Wind; A Damsel lay deploring, All on a Rock reclin'd. Wide o'er the rolling Billows She cast a wistful Look; Her Head was crown'd with Willows That tremble o'er the Brook. 2. Twelve Months are gone and over, And nine long tedious Days. Why didst thou, vent'rous Lover, Why didst thou trust the Seas? Cease, cease, thou cruel Ocean, And let my Lover rest; Ah! what's thy troubled Motion To that within my Breast? 3. The Merchant, rob'd of Pleasure, Sees Tempests in Despair; But what's the Loss of Treasure To losing of my Dear? Should you some Coast be laid on Where Gold and Di'monds grow, You'd find a richer Maiden, But none that loves you so. 4. How can they say that Nature Has nothing made in vain; Why then beneath the Water Should hideous Rocks remain? No Eyes the Rocks discover, That lurk beneath the Deep, To wreck the wand'ring Lover, And leave the Maid to weep. 5. All melancholy lying, Thus wail'd she for her Dear; Repay'd each Blast with Sighing, Each Billow with a Tear; When o'er the white Wave stooping His floating Corpse she spy'd; Then like a Lilly drooping, She bow'd her Head, and dy'd. Kitty. Why in this World should wretched Kitty stay? What if these Hands should make my self away? I could not sure do otherways than well. A Maid so true's too innocent for Hell. But hearkye, Cis— [Whispers and gives her a Penknife Aunt. —I'll do't—'tis but to try If the poor Soul can have the Heart to die. [Aside to the Haymakers. Thus then I strike—but turn thy Head aside. Kitty. 'Tis shameless sure to fall as Pigs have dy'd. No—take this Cord— [Gives her a Cord. Aunt. —With this thou shalt be sped. [Putting the Noose round her Neck. Kitty. But Curs are hang'd.— Aunt. —Christians should die in bed. Kitty. Then lead me thither; there I'll moan and weep, And close these weary Eyes in Death.— Aunt. —or Sleep. [Aside. Kitty. When I am cold, and stretch'd upon my Bier, My restless Sprite shall walk at Midnight here: Here shall I walk—for 'twas beneath yon Tree Filbert first said he lov'd—lov'd only me. [Kitty faints. Grandmother. She swoons, poor Soul—help, Dolly. Aunt. —She's in Fits. Bring Water, Water, Water.— [Screaming. Grandmother. —Fetch her Wits. [They throw Water upon her. Kitty. Hah!—I am turn'd a Stream—look all below; It flows, and flows, and will for ever flow. The Meads are all afloat—the Haycocks swim. Hah! who comes here?—my Filbert! drown not him. Bagpipes in Butter, Flocks in fleecy Fountains, Churns, Sheep-hooks, Seas of Milk, and honey Mountains. SCENE IX. Kitty, Grandmother, Aunt, Haymakers, Chorus of Sighs and Groans, Filbert. Kitty. It is his Ghost—or is it he indeed? Wert thou not sent to War? hah, dost thou bleed? No—'tis my Filbert. Filbert. [Embracing her. —Yes, 'tis he, 'tis he. Dorcas confess'd; the Justice set me free. I'm thine again.— Kitty. —I thine— Filbert. —Our Fears are fled. Come, let's to Church, to Church.— Kitty. —To wed. Filbert. —To Bed. Chorus of Haymakers. A Wedding, a Bedding; a Wedding, a Bedding. [Exeunt all the Actors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sir Roger. Ay, now for the Wedding. Where's he that plays the Parson. Now, Neighbours, you shall see what was never shewn upon the London Stage.—Why, heigh day! what's our Play at a stand? Enter a Countryman. Country-man. So, please your Worship, I should have play'd the Parson, but our Curate would not lend his Gown, for he says it is a Profanation. Sir Roger. What a scrupulous Whim is this? an innocent thing! believe me an innocent thing. [The Justices assent by Nods and Signs. Enter Stave the Parish-Clark. Stave. Master Doctor saith he hath two and twenty good Reasons against it from the Fathers, and he is come himself to utter them unto your Worship. Sir Roger. What shall our Play be spoil'd? I'll have none of his Reasons—call in Mr. Inference. Stave goes out, and re-enters. Stave. Sir, he saith he never greatly affected Stage Plays. Within. Stave, Stave, Stave. Sir Roger. Tell him that I say— Within. Stave, Stave. Sir Roger. What shall the Curate controul me? Have not I the Presentation? Tell him that I will not have my Play spoil'd; nay, that he shall marry the Couple himself— I say he shall. Stave goes out, and re-enters. Stave. The Steward hath perswaded him to join their Hands in the Parlour within— but he saith he will not, and cannot in Conscience consent to expose his Character before neighbouring Gentlemen; neither will he enter into your Worship's Hall; for he calleth it a Stage pro tempore. Sir Humphry. Very likely: The good Man may have Reason. Justice Statute. In troth, we must in some sort comply with the scrupulous tender conscienc'd Doctor. Sir Roger. Why, what's a Play without a Marriage? and what is a Marriage, if one sees nothing of it? Let him have his Humour— but set the Doors wide open, that we may see how all goes on. [Exit Stave. [Sir Roger at the Door pointing. So natural! d'ye see now, Neighbours? the Ring, i-faith—to have and to hold! right again —well play'd, Doctor; well play'd, Son Thomas. Come, come, I'm satisfy'd—now for the Fiddles and Dances. Enter Steward, Squire Thomas, Kitty, Stave, &amp;c. Steward. Sir Roger, you are very merry. So comes a Reck'ning when the Banquet's o'er, The dreadful Reck'ning, and Men smile no more. I wish you Joy of your Play, and of your Daughter. I had no way but this to repair the Injury your Son had done my Child—She shall study to deserve your Favour. [Presenting Kitty to Sir Roger. Sir Roger. Married! how married! can the Marriage of Filbert and Carrot have any thing to do with my Son? Steward. But the Marriage of Thomas and Katharine may, Sir Roger. Sir Roger. What a plague, am I trick'd then? I must have a Stage Play, with a Pox! Sir Humphry. If this Speech be in the Play, remember the Tankard, Sir Roger. Squire Thomas. Zooks, these Stage Plays are plaguy dangerous Things—but I am no such Fool neither, but I know this was all your Contrivance. Justice Statute. Ay, Sir Roger, you told us it was you that gave him the Hint. Sir Roger. Why Blockhead! Puppy! had you no more Wit than to say the Ceremony? he should only have married you in Rhime, Fool. Squire Thomas. Why, what did I know ha? but so it is—and since Murder will out, as the Saying is; look ye Father, I was under some sort of a Promise too, d'ye see— so much for that—If I be a Husband, I be a Husband, there's an End on't.—sure I must have been married some time or other. [Sir Roger walks up and down fretting, and goes out in a Passion. Sir Humphry. In troth, it was in some sort my Opinion before; it is good in Law. Justice Statute. Good in Law, good in Law—but hold, we must not lose the Dance. A DANCE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Stave. Our Stage Play has a Moral—and no doubt You all have Sense enough to find it out. FINIS.</field>
