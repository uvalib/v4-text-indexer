      <field name="fulltext">ACT I SCEN 1. The Direction. Hysiphyle Orion Florida with attendaunts, Men and women Huntresses on either syde. Hysiphyle with a Ghirlond Imperiall of Bayes. They kist at their meeting Then Hypsiphyle spake as followes. Hypsiphyle Orion Florida. Hyp. My Lord Orion, you be right welcome To Eluida, how does his Grace? I pray. Or. At my departure from Court I left him In Health, In token of which with these your Ladiship he greetes, See. Hyp. Sir, I thank you. And where lyes the Court now? Or. At Obera. Hyp. My Cosens, they do well? all. Or. All right well. Hyp. Myne eyes haue a Rheume with sitting late, And therefore, Florida, with liuing Toung Deliver them vp, thou, vnto our eares. Flor. To my louing Cosen Hypsiphyle Greeting. I am giuen to vnderstand, that not onely thourough the Negligence of you, but also by that of your fellow Huntresses my frutefull and florishing Forest of Eluida goeth to decaye, And that such sundry abuses do daily rise thereby. Wherefore this is the cause that I by these my Letters now thought it meet to require you That you surrender the sayd Forrest together with the Appurtenaunces thereto belonging to my well beloued kinsman Orion right famous for his skill and Industry thourough our Forrests and chases, As for the sayd abuses they will appeare the better vpon the Reformation of them. This I charge you perfourme and to perfourme it willingly, For I will beleeue the complaint of my Keepers. Obera, from our Faery Court there, And from the last yeare of the Reigne of Julius our Father to this the present yeare of our Reigne See the number in one of our Almanacks. And the forty and fifth day of this present Greace 1647. Your louing Cosen Oberon. Hyp. Come you lyke to Laureate victors crownd? Then with Mineruaes Oliues Bound? Sit you Sure, For if you can not proue such abuses To be in Eluida as you suppose By my Faith you nimbd not furth so lightly My fingers the Forrest of the Faeryes. Or. Madame, if I were disposd so, I could Produce those abuses that daily be Comitt in Eluida that in the end you would with shame subscribe to your error Hyp. Wherein, I pray you. Repeate them if you may. Or. No sooner was I entered the Park But I found, loe, Heardes of Bulls and Boares Rooting those Commons which my Deere should feede, Besyde such spoilings and vp turnings where They came, that such was the Hauock thereby They pilled not onely the Barks well grown But eate the young Sprigges in their growth too, So That they starud the Poore Deere for want of shelter. Hyp. Better I hope, my Lord, to let the Swyne Route those woodes, then the Soyle by its ranknes Should smother the Bucks in their greace. For such Heades as they feede better on a short grasse Then on larger commons. Or. Admit they doe, Yet they should not vndoe the tender Plants That serue for shelter vnto you and them. Hyp. If but of the Plants you do complaine so Greater Trees will our wants supplye, So that By the vniointed tattars of your talk I do see you do come rather to cauill Then to redresse those Things, that be amisse. Or. If so, why do you let the Brakes, I praye, To Multiplye with Toades and snakes? When as Y'haue a charme giu'n you by your Ancestours T'expell the venemous from off your Soyle? Hyp. I graunt, wee haue a powrfull charme and that Verifyde by long Experience, But so Multitudinous the Frye wee had neede, Ibis or ophiophagi to ridde Our Forrest of so Fructeous a Foe. Or. Neuer, I weene, Since Eluida hath beene, In Eluida such errors haue beene seene. Hyp. Faeryes may alter Things as their pleasure, That if any Thing w' haue spent our Tyme The same may be redrest in Twink of eye. At what then may your Lordship so complaine? Or. Haue I not cause, think you? to complaine, Seeing the Pales and Saults to be broake downe, That in twenty places Malignant witches, In shapes of Polecattes, Lizards, and weasells, May creepe in betweene to bewitch the Fawnes? Hyp. That's the Syluans' office, my Lord, not ours. Or. Wee pay our Syluans, but you pay yourselues. Hyp. I dart it to you back, For I'll be sworne Wee haue not onely pawnd our Bowes and quivers But sold that Gland wee daily feede on To satisfye your turne Or. other wordes would Better beseeme your Modesty, Lady. Yet what's the cause Honnest Hysiphyle, Syluius with his Bands of Forresters Spoiles the game, murdreth Fawnes, affrights the Doaes? Committing lyke outrages, whilst you run Tripping ore the greenes, that for twise-ten bucks I told before I can now tell but one? Hyp. The Rot hath consumd them, thats the cause. Or. If not for you the Rot had neuer beene. Hyp. Since Cankers swarmd, wee could ne're clench the soyle. Or. Stand you? to teare at vs, Hoa, wee haue Our Commission, by the vertue of which I require you what be the Lawes you vse? When lyke Pigmies you ride against thee Deere. Hyp. On Rammes and Goates wee compase in the Beast, With Cymbales, Basons Piping and Tooting, With goades, with Potguns, Scarcrowes and with reedes, Then his Parts diuided into shares, wee Bestowe the Miser in Baskits all along Or. Be you not ashamd? First to come in Troupes Upon a Fugitiue, but also then With notes of Triumphe make him to bewayle Th'vnkindnes of his Keepers? I discharge you Hyp. Will you enforce vs? our cause not yet hearde? My Lord, fore I do loose my right, I will Vse all the Points of woodmanship I haue Gainst you, win the Crown weare you it and mee, And loe, in pawn, I hurle him vp our Tropheye. She hurld her ghirlond Imperiall vp to Front of the Fane or Chappell. Or. Lady, Since you be so Peremptory I'll accept the Pawn, and vse my whole Skill To win you and it. Better open Foe Then Foe conceald Hyp. Neuer weild I Bowe I Make you not forgoe the feild with shame Or. Neuer strike I Buck if before night you Recant not your humour Hyp.

Christ. Doe you say? If I shall but chewe eury Morning any one of these Reasons from a Gore-belly Dæmon as I am now I shall then become Elf as you be? At. Just as Jenkin, sure. Hyl. Beleeue him, M r Christophel, on so sacred an Oathe. Christ. Once more discouer mee the Frayle, Come. At. Thus. First the Squirill will so practise your Corpus cum Causa, both your worships Temples will distill thereby lyke the drops of a Lawyers labour. Hyl. O for the Excrement of that Excrement but, It might be sold for much and giuen to Mountibanks. Christ. By fate of my body I sweate Indifferently following a Beare, Therefore neede not in my opinion further breake the Tombler. At. If by maene of following a Beare your Flesh should be exhaled all euen into a Pumice stone, yet the Dregges of an Earthy disposition would then lykwise settle in your Breetch, if the Beare should but regard you grim. Hyl. So the Plummet being lowe and base it would Tyranically aduance the rumbling of your Clock. Christ. Then a course or Two at a Butterflye should serue my turne. At. Haulking is Haulking and Hunting is Hunting. Christ. Idem per Idem, yet follow. At. If wee that be huntsmen should leaue our Hunting and fall to Haulking wee might so in Tyme transport our Forrest of Elues into the Aire. Christ. So establish a newe world? At. I, Sir. Christ. The Gyaunts were dismount for mounting Mounts. Hyl. Will you Committ lyke Sacriledge? Christ. Seigneur No. At. Doe. Christ. O no. At. What say you? Christ. After your Mountibuck Præludium you would but shewe vs your ware now At. Wee will vse you well. Christ. I thank you for it. At. Come neare I pray you. Christ. Myne eares do stretch vnto you At. The one Contrary deuoureth the other contrary. Christ. As once well clothed Diues did the naked Lazarus. dilue Hyl. The same Reason. For what in Ciuill Lawe belongeth to one, that is the inferior, the same belongeth also to him that is his superior. At. You lykwise, if together with this violence of Squirilling you would but admitt worshipfull M r Heate into your Lodge, he would in a Trice emptye your greasy Tub. Christ. The liquour I confesse, Now for the exhaling the dregs. At. A Pantagruel Pille would clench you as you were a Jakes. Christ. Vndoe mee the Trick, I pray you. At. Pantagruel one day lying on his death bed swallowed down his Mawe a Ternary of Chimney Sweepes, that were enclosed into as many Balles of Brasse, who after they had sufficiently purged his Filth came all back in them againe with the Tyde in a vomit, So you, Sir, according the Proportion shall be purged with as many Horse-leeches. Hyl. How say you? Sir. Christ. No Rakehell enters my Gutts on my Fa. At. Take you then an other Receipt into you, I pray you. Christ. Rather a Commodity, Therefore passe you now mee ouer to the Commoditys of the sport, I pray. At. Whereas Hunting the Buck you may follow him Three myle without stop or staye, Hunting the Squirrill at eury step you make you may then obteyne a Tree to leane on. Christ. I mary, How seeme I now vnto you? Here he strouted. At. A prick-eare Curr. Christ. How before. Hyl. A Lagged Asse. Christ. You aime at my Phisnomies At.

O saye. Pic. Learchus, the eyes of Camilla haue So bewitcht poore Picus that be hath not Sence or Feeling what course to take herein, Yet the Ardure of that Flame that burneth Within him is so feirce and violent That Hap had, Hap dab, what course so euer May be deuised in the enterprise Will seeme to be both small and vnæquall To th'obteyning the Palme of his desire. Hipp. Nay, Picus, nay, Rather an ordinary course dilue Is to be attempted before wee shall Put in vre an Extraordinary For Mylde wordes and gentle Locutions haue Moued the Gods of Olympus come down In releif of their suppliant Mistrisses As by our sacred Poets hath beene told. Pic. Hippolon, Hippolon, those radiant gleames Camilla gloomes from the circumference Of her sweet Arched eyen will terrifye Any shall but dare pleade his cause to her. Lear. And for those ruddy cheekes of Florida, They do seeme to mee those starting Apples Of Tantalus if I should offer but One Snatch at their back-sliding boughes, I weene. Hipp. But the wordes of Fancia nere so feirce Will qualify vpon the notes I know Of my strick and feruent affection of her— If any tyme I may but sing my suite to her. Lear. For there is such a chill of Chastitye In the Breasts of these Impes of Diana And that by their continuall Practise In Hunting, that sooner you shall split Rocks In Twayne then breake them of their Frowardnes. Pic. Nay, I think Camilla's extract from line Of that Camilla in greate virgil told That sooner would flye ouer Spikes of corne Then to be tayne by Man in this round Mound. Lear. And Florida will sooner leape from Rock As Ino did then yeild her little Lambe Vnto the vse of feirce Learchus lust. So keene she is against th'Assault of vs. Hipp. Fancia of an other strayne is sure, As I am thouroughly persuaded of her, For as her name doth forcibly Implye She may Fancey some though late it be, Nunquam sera est ad bonos mores via. Lear. Who that some should be I cannot decerne. My self, I cannot rectifye my mind so, Florida myne in any sort will be. Hipp. Si vox est canta, si mollia brachia salta, Et quæcunq, potes dote placere place. Lear. For haue I not vsed those many shifts Could be deuisd to bring my wind about, Yet see, Oh see, she will be none to mee. Hipp. Si precibus non vult cedere rumpe moras. Pic. Well brought about, Hoa, For women if soft Toucht will sting lyke nettles, if rubd againe Well will beare the Touch, Oh, beare vp, I saye. Hipp. Now Picus sheweth him a Man of Proofe. Pic. And trye the Conclusion, For my lime-Bush Shall hent the flightest Haggard, flyes this day. Lear. Yet in Importunity men do saye No losse is, wherefore giue th'Assault once more And if wee shall not speede so, then let vs Sing the black Saunce the one against the other. Come. Pic. Well vyde, Learchus by my Truth; Come. Hipp. So goe wee on and first see the Tryall. Lear. Then come, And follow mee to Court you too. Hipp. I doe. SCEN 4. Florida Camilla Fancia. Flo.

Consydering his Nobility I conteynd, yet wrung him as good on the withers. Flo. Let's see the girth, wench. Fan. Knowing him for worse then a Crowder, I sayd to him be you pricking Fancyes? my Lord. Cam. How warded he thy blowe? Fancia. Fan. Thus, No Fancyes, faire Lady, but Fan's eyes. Flo. I know where he pickt that Gooseberry. Cam. Did he not laugh at sauoure of his own conceit? Ha. Fan. Each one knows better the Nature of an other man's breathe, then he does his own. Flo. Learchus has bestowd on mee a Pound of Figges! Sisters. Cam. Sirrha, why didst not ride him with his Asse? then. Fan. Asses ride Mares and women ride Asses. Flo. At what laughest thou? Camilla. Cam. Since you speake of riding at a pretie Trick my Horse cast playd mee. Fan. Putt Spurrs to the Jade. Cam. Picus being to ride before mee to Park would needes in courtesye haue had mee mount vp before him. Flo. How gottst thou furth the Gripe of his Importunity? dilue Sirrha. Cam. Thus, God made women for the vnder hand not for the vpper, my Lord. Fan. Was he not thereon Blankt or blanketted? Cam.

Being to walk before mee to Court, there was neuer a wench mett vs on the way betweene this and thither but he kist her. Fan. What was his reason for it? sayd he. Flo. As sweete meates must haue sowre sauces to them, so my sweet kisse, sayd he, would relish so much the better after their sowre ones. Fan. He gaue thee it right. Cam. Cum Comento. Fan. With one dost ouer and aboue I beleeue. Flo. Cam. But is this all may be sayd of them? Fan. Much more. Flo. Well. Is it not worthy th'obseruing? That men of their esteeme should be so poore In Acts Heroick, Cheuallryes, And in The Treasures of the mynd, while eury Pesaunt Surpasses them in witt and worthynes? What's to be done Sisters, Camilla, Fancia? For such their ill brought vp vntowardnes? Saye. Cam. Since they come t'encroach on Eluida Not lyke Commissioners but Conquerours Camillae's resolute opinion is Wee serue them each an Eluish Trick. Flo. Agreed. Fan. Who begins? Flo. That will I, and but Pray Whilst I am with Learchus you would but Moue this Bush and for the rest to leaue mee. Fan.

Flo. Then thinkest thou, Learchus, to obteyne Or Loue or fauour at my hand and come with that Hostilitye vpon our soyle? Sooner shall the Motors of the Sphæres retort Their wheeling circles Retrograde, then Floride will yeild the gemme of her virginity vnto the Pleasure of a loathed Foe. Lear. Madame, I do confesse wee haue beene bold T'haue come by vertue of Commission Vpon your Park and on your Pastourage, But how vnwilling, and with what Hearte-breake Learchus went with them in companie These euerlasting lampes of Heauen do know. Flo. It is an Antique Sawe, you may not force The Horse to raugh, vnles he please, his draught Nor a Camell loade with Indian drugges Opprest to rise lesse you ease him of the loade, And you, who might haue forced you thus to come With Runnegates vpon our soyle and haue Such propper stumps to beare your Trunk away. And therefore, Faery, take you this for Paye, The Gander caught with other Fowles of Praye Made vp for companie the Fowlers Praye. Lear. O bitter sop vnto a woe-begone, O sowrest Pill of Tart Acrimonye, O all the Scummes of Magick Tempraments, If that the world were saught and I were he Inioind by Cytheræaes doome to search A Perfect butcher for an Amourist, For the whole vast of this circumference I would not moue one Jote I sweare from hence. Flo. I see I shall neuer be rid of thee, But thus still to be torment with thy suite. Lear. Who's he? that sees a gallant Soule in th'Aire, But would desire to heare him speake. Who's he? That knowes a pretious cup I weene but would Be glad therein to dip? Who's he? that spies A gentle Doue in compasse of his yarde And would not 'tice him in? Then, Florida, Certes, since this thou beest and more then this Why should I not entreate thee with a kisse? Flo. If force? what Remedye. Then know, Learchus Hypsiphyle holdeth so strick a watch Ouer mee and ouer my Sisters, That Now there is no place to fullfill thy wish, Then, sweet Learchus, staye till th'Elues be gone To rest, And then— Lear. Nay but now sweet Florida. Flo. Now? Sir. The Sun, loe, beates vpon our crowns, Th'Adders peere about the grasse, The Noon-tyde Arrowe flyes, And all things els conspire To Thwart and crosse your heddy enterprise. Lear. If all the world were saught, and all things In him conteynd were vp to hinder mee I would not let but venture as I may. Flo. Come on your way, neede will driue the Toughest Cart I see. But behold the Bushes moue My Lady is at hand, For gods sake, Sir, Hide you in this well and preuent the worst. Lear. Say you? my Lady is at hand? Flo. Beleeue It, she will take vs in the Fact.

I thank you, Sir, Hurt not your self I praye She let him down the well by the Pullye. So coldly rest you there till I release you. Now, Florida, aduaunce thy victor steede And with a Magnanimity resembling That quondam Roman Ostager Breake through this Tyde of Importunity. For was it not my virgin Doue? Gainst which Bending as many darts as whilom forct Greate Regulus against the Beast of Tyre He aymed at with that alacrity? Wast not that wax? Far chaster than ones Mouth, Of my virginitye? he thought t'haue stampt His seale vpon and so t'haue borne the Floure Of mee by Priuiledge of the Charter? Then Prayse to Joue, and to that virgin Queene Dread Mistris of our woodes, For they not beene, For all those Nurtures of thy tender youth, For all th'Examples of thy God-lyke Peeres, The vipers treates had shakt thy Constancy, And therefore vowe vnto their shrynes aduaunce Of armed Maydes, a Deede of waxen Brond From hand to hand, withall a Compitall, As a Thank-offer for my deliu'rye. For now I shall vnto my Sisters vaunt it My Loue did brush vp his Mustach and want it. But, Florida, stint thy strife, the day growes old, And weary Phæbus turnes his Teeme now home. Thou must make here the vauntlay to the Deere According Hypsiphyle her bidding, So keepe him from the Brooke he do not proffer. So, Learchus, I bid you now Adieu, And therwith mee do recommend to you. SCEN 4. Takes hold of her as she flyes.Picus Camilla. Pic.

Picus, The darts Camillas eyes do hurle Be euer Pestilent vnto that Man Dareth depriue her of her flowre, Then According what reason or consequence Should they lyke Telephus or still or kill? Pic. The Flyes, they say Cantharides euen as Within their corps circumference they beare A deadly Poyson, so do they carry A Cordiall Medcine in their wing, A Fish Sea Pastinaca hight, as good he is For wholesome Nourishment of man, so In closet of his Tayle he conteyneth A dire and mortall sting, Then why, Camilla, As from thy eyes thou dartest scalding Bolts Hable to make fell Tyraunts hide their heds, From some where els thou shouldest not deliuer An equall sluce of waues to quench the same! Cam. Lou'st mee, Picus, and thou sayst? say Pic. Madame, By this eternall Beame I vowe I do And none besyde, in Eluida, but you. Cam. Then Seruaunt (For so now I will call you) Doe but include in hollowe of this oake, And when I haue blowne to the Deere his death (For so my Lady chargd on her displeasure) I will returne Pic. I do obeye Cam. Then Come. Pic. Camilla, Camilla, my Camilla. Cam. What makes my seruaunt with that vehence To recall his Camilla so Pic. Thou hast Inclosed mee, o Camilla, among A Sort of Bees, whose merciles stings do prick Mee to the quick Cam. Alas deare Hearte, Pic. And with Frightfull murmurs do build their circling Nests Within myne eares. Cam. O sillie mee begone. Pic. Camilla, I do feele the Pangues of death. Cam. Speake no more Pic. Shift mee some where els Cam. Alas I can not, yet if my Teares may serue to Alay the Rigour of thy smart Behold Them shed abundantly Pic. Reach mee a bough I may abate their Furyes at the least. Cam. I must away, Behold the Deere at Bea, And the whole crewe of Huntresses all, with wind of Horne, do now come in to the Fall, I must away, or I shall be shent sure. So sweet, deare Lord Picus, my life, my ioye, Tarry you there but till I come to you. Pic. Ha, now I see thou art deluded, Pice, Camilla, Camilla, why Camilla? Ha, gone? And I left in misery here? Then Picus burst thou these fetterd Bands off Of thy Affliction and with the Tyde Of the Extremity beare thou now down The strong opposed Bulwark of thy woe.

What be men, my Lord Oberon, But Bubbles puft with the Aire, Soone begotten and soone crackt into wind, wee women, lyke to Constant Rocks of Adamant can withstand the Puisant and boisterous Assaults of Inconstancy in Loue, whatsoeuer, nay Howsoeuer, and whensoeuer I assure you verily better then you can.

Then is it in vs nothing to haue bloods and Faculties more firme and stronger then you haue, yet that wee should be such abiect veselles wee should not once be able to resist that weake and feeble Imperfection of Inconstancy in Loue better then you? Saye. Chlo. Constancy, my Lord Oberon, consisteth together and alone in Closet of the Soule, Now Although some of our Aduersaryes do affirme against vs that women haue no soules in them at all, yet if the cause be euer to be tryed by its effect, Then I say wee women shall shewe better and greater Proofs of the Soule in vs then you can, So by consequence the greater Constancye in our Loue. Ob. I will put it to the Arbitriment of Jupiter himself whither of the Two hath the greater Affection in Loue, thou or I, So whither of the Two hath the Perfecter Soule. Chlo. By Jupiter!

I do assure you, Sweet, and speake it too by Prophesye, There is a Man now comming toward vs who shall euidently make it appeare, By a Miracle of myne own too, that my saying is trewe, and that you women haue not all the Type of Affection of Loue in you, as you say you haue, But wee men haue an equall share of Loue with you remayning in our selues also.

I haue, my Lord, I old Tiresias once trewe Prophet of Thebes, now blind Seer of Hell, come from Jupiter, a Trewe suppliaunt to your Maiesty, now but from Pluto his Court, wafted hither by the sacred wand of Mercury the Guide. Ob. Who be these your followers? saye. Tir. The one of them is Mopsus my Sonne, the other Manto my daughter. Ob. Say your mind. Tir. Once, on a Tyme, Jupiter and Juno being ouergone in wyne they were disposed to be merry the one with the other, For their Recreation. Jupiter would needes maintayne against his wife that men bore the greater Affection in Loue th? did the women, Juno mayntayned the contrary against him that women bore the greater Affection then did the Men. So long they contended they were ready fall to blowes, when Jupiter wiser of the Two (For he had a hed more strong and firme then had his wife to beare his wyne, as he who but little before had carryed an Armed Mayde in his brayne) sayd, nay, wife, rather then that thou scratch furth myne eyes by the bargaine, I prithy let vs put the deciding of the controuersy to that old Prophet of Thebes Tiresias by name who hath tryed both Sexes, they say; Be it so, sayd Juno, let the Man be Incontinently sent for. I being come before their Maiesties according my slender skill gaue sentence on Jupiter his syde, For the which Juno was so wroth and cholerick at mee then, she beate furth my eyen both yea both the Twayne of them (verily and right well now I do it weene) euen furth in a rage, I in good Sooth my good Lord. Jupiter to make mee amends for losse of my eyes Imparte to mee the gift of Prophesye; so liuing in darknes, many succeeding Age after, It came at last (after my decease I weet) into their mindes to restore to mee my Sight, But with condition I should appeale to a man, who for his wisdome and for his Experience had more skill in the case then I had, And who but by touching myne eyes with a wand should in confirmation of this Right restore to mee my Sight. Now if many memoryes be (as the Philosophers affirme) the Mother of Experience, And that experience is the Mistris of all Arts and Sciences that be conteyned vnder this vniversall Globe, To whom should I addresse myself, thought I, then to your longliud Maiesty, who now King of the Faeryes (Lyke to the Husband of Aurora) as you haue now liued from Julius your Father to this now present Moment, So our hopes be you shall protract the same yeares to an hundreth and hundreth Generations yet to come more. And to whom, Behold I haue now Adressed my humble and most Importunate Petition concerning my whole estate, And the which so doing I do not doubt but that I shall recouer my vnlucky and forfaited sight once more, which the Gods graunt mee, I beseech them all, for their mercyes cause. Dixi. Ob. Most Pretie, Cum remini obtrudi potest itur ad me, when the Gods cannot decide the Controuersy, I must. But to the Buisinesse wee haue in hand. First, for the better vnwinding the Knot that wee are now to vntwyne, First. you are to vnderstand, that if at any tyme it so hap that a woman doth surmount a man in the vehemency of her Loue, The Man then not answering the woman with the lyke Affection, then I say that Loue cannot be called Loue, but rather a sudden Impotency in Nature, For Amicitia est inter Pares say the Philosophers, Trew freindship is not to be seene but betweene equalls. Againe whereas the sayd Philosophers affirme that Maius lumen obfuscat minus lumen, The greater Light doth dim the lesser light, If lykewise the Man be to whot and chalcrously bent toward the woman and the woman be but cold and feeble in complexion toward the man, that Loue can not be Loue neither but the Embryon or the vnperfect Mushrome of Loue (If the daunce agree not with the Musick, nor the Musick agree with the daunce, there then will be there neither daunce nor Musick I am persuaded). Thirdly, if trew it be that Diuines do affirme the woman to be borne of mans boane and flesh of mans Flesh, Also that Man and Woman be both of them but one boane and one Flesh, So both one and the same in one and same substance, And that contraria non possunt cohærere in vno et eodem subiecto simul, Contraryes may not abide in one and same subiect together at one and self tyme, Then I do most peremptorily enforce my Argument and do affirme, that the one louing and the other not louing, or the one being but in Loue, the other vnæquall in her Loue, there cannot then be there abiding any the least Essence of Loue, But rather a totaller voyd vacuum or vacuity of Loue in both the Two. So finally giue in my verdict, that a woman can not beare greater affection to the man, than can a Man beare to the woman, nor a man a greater affection the woman then can the woman beare to the Man, But that both of them equally and Indifferently to haue both of them. I say, their equall and indifferent shares of Loue in any one kind of their Loues, if it be Loue. So Jupiter if I haue spoken right, restore to this blind man by mee his sight. He toucht his eyes with Butt-end of his wand. Tir. Blest be that hand hath giu'n mee second light. Ob. O how Excellent is the powre of mighty Joue. Tir. But I must away, Mercury wafte mee back, So Prayse and thank to good King Oberon. Ob. My lyke Adieu, to thee, my good old man. The Direction. Mercury entring by the Midde doore wafted them back by the doore they came in. Chlo. This hath gone hard against mee, my Lord, nor may I now well reuoake it, since it is so fully and trewly confirmed against mee by Miracle, But what doth your Maiestie heare of my Lord orion? Is he in health or hath he obteyned the victory he went about? Ob. Trust mee, Madame, I haue not hearde any thing of him since his departure from Court. But my hope is he shall præuayle, so deepe is his wisdome in Sciences, And so Excellent his high skill in woodmanship. But I hope thou and I be not yet in strife about the victory? Chlo. No in perfect sadnes am I, my Lord Oberon. Ob. Then let vs kisse, and confirme it therewith. Chlo. Yes, in good Faith, my Lord, be it so. Here they knockt vp the Consort.</field>

From the leaf referred to in the Margin. Sir Philip Sydneis Song. The Tyme hath beene that a Taudry lace Or a Bonnet for my Ladyes grace. A Ring of a Rish or Needles case Would make any Lady to loue mee, But now the world is grown so ritch, They will haue it be it ne'er so mich, Yet by your leaue they will keepe no tich, The which doth not a little moue mee, Fye vpon honestie Fye. Your heade is full of Jelouzie. There is no fault in my Lady For to suspect the contrarye. Philip Sydneye Knight. Picus alone. Pic. It was a Tyme when gallant Caualleeres To please their Dames abandond Speare and sheild And tooke the Rayle and Rocke, But now's the Tyme Faeryes of former dayes Symplicity Must doff their kind and habit to be auengd On a Faeryes Treachery; Hercules Tooke Needle to sowe in his Ladyes Samplar, Picus I, to pricke my Dame a Leçon, Joue Dians shape to obtayne a Goddesse, I A womans to beguile a woman. Now, Mistris Camilla, looke vnto your self, I'haue besome, faith, in brine to breetch you with, But what? He that enuironeth a Praye Must waite his Tyme and catch it when he may. Then be thou ready, Picus, with thy wyles, Thy cases, thy vizards and deuices This foreintended Comædy to Act Now on the stage of her vntowardnes. It was a Fashion among the Romanes To celebrate the Holiday of Risus (When eury Hed did grin and shew the Teeth) With some Ridiculous and notorious Jeast, Now then if Risus be a God as well I do account him, I will so Polish His spleene with the Fyle of a Jeast, that from God Laughter I will make him to become God Rupture, For as a Pickle of Mirth Applyde on some will cause men gently laugh, So the same practised vpon an Elf Will force them burst their bounds which Bounds Once burst a Rupture must ensewe. But what? Least lyke an vnskilfull Preacher that drawes His Prayer longer then he does his Sermon, I wrest my Prologue longer then my Playe, Since lusty gallants I am alone here In silent groues with which there euer is Such Joint affinity with Harmonye I'll giue you my voice yet ere Play begin.
