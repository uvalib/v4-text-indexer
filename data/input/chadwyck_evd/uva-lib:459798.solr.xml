      <field name="fulltext">THE RESTAURATION: OR, Right will take Place. A TRAGICOMEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE. By the Duke of Buckingham. Nothing is harder in the World to do, Than to quit what our Nature leads us to. As this our Friend here proves, who, having spent His Time and Wealth for other Folks Content; Tho' he so much as Thanks could never get, Cann't, for his Life, quite give it over yet; But, striving still to please you, hopes he may, Without a Grievance, try to mend a Play. Perhaps he wish'd it might have been his Fate To lend a helping Hand to mend the State: Tho' he conceives, as things have lately run, 'Tis somewhat hard at present to be done. Well, let that pass, the Stars that rule the Rout, Do what we can, I see, must whirl about: But here's the Devil on't, that, come what will, His Stars are sure to make him Loser still. When all the Polls together made a Din, Some to put out, and others to put in, And every where his Fellows got and got From being nothing to be God knows what: He, for the Public, needs would play a Game, For which he has been trounc'd by public Fame; And to speak Truth, so he deserv'd to be For his dull clownish Singularity: For when the Fashion is to break ones Trust, 'Tis Rudeness then to offer to be Just.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis Personæ. MEN. The King. Philander, true Heir to the Crown. Thrasomond, Prince of Spain. Cleon, A Lord. Agremont, Gentleman his Confederate. Adelard, Gentleman his Confederate. A Spaniard, Governour to Prince Thrasomond. WOMEN. Araminta, The King's Daughter. Melesinda, A modest Lady attending on the Princess. Alga, A wanton Court Lady. Two other Court Ladies. Euphrosyne, Daughter to Cleon, but disguised like a Page, under the Name of Endymion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Sicily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. Cleon, Agremont and Adelard. Agr. Here's no Body come yet. Cleon. They had Orders from the King to attend here. Besides it has been published, that no Officer should deny Admission to any Gentleman that desire to attend and hear. Agr. Can you ghess the Cause of this Ceremony? Cleon. That's plain, Sir, the foreign Prince that's come to marry Araminta, Heiress to this Kingdom. Adel. Your diving Politicians, and those who would seem to have deep Intelligence, give out that she does not like him. Cleon. O, Sir, the Multitude speak what they would have. But her Father has sent this Prince so many Assurances of the Match before his coming over, that I think she's resolved to be ruled. Agr. And will this foreign Prince enjoy both the Kingdom of Sicily and Calabria, Sir? Cleon. That it is so intended is most certain; but it will sure be very troublesome and difficult for him to enjoy them both in Safety, the Right Heir to one of them being now living, and of so noble and virtuous a Character, especilaly when the People are possessed with an Admiration of the Bravery of his Mind and Pity of his Injuries. Agr. You mean Philander. Cleon. I mean the same. His Father, we all know, was unjustly driven by our late King of Calabria from his fruitful Sicily: I wish the Blood I drew my self in those accursed Wars were well wash'd off. Agr. My Ignorance of the Affairs of Sicily will not let me know how it comes to pass that Philander (being Heir to one of these Kingdoms) the King should suffer him to go abroad so much at Liberty. Cleon. Your Temper is more fortunate, I find, than to busy your self in enquiring after State News; but I must tell you that lately the King risqu'd both his Kingdoms for offering to imprison Philander. For the City rose in Armes, nor could be quell'd by any Threats or Force till they saw the Prince ride thro' the Streets unguarded; and then throwing up their Caps with loud Huzza's and Bonfires, they laid aside their military Appointments. This Reason Politicians give for the Marriage of his Daughter to a foreign Prince, that he may be able to keep his own People in Awe by his Forces. Agr. Who is this Prince's Father? Cleon. A Person of mean Extraction, but by Wiles and Arts obtaining Power, usurp'd the Kingdom where he reigns, and keeps it under by a standing Army, which our King intends to copy. Enter Melesinda, Alga, a Lady and a Spaniard. Adel. See the Ladies, what's the first? Cleon. A worthy Lady that attends the Princess. Adel. The other that follows her? Cleon. She is one that loves to try the several Constitutions of Men's Bodies, and indeed has destroyed her own by making Experiments upon them, for the good of the Commonwealth. Agr. Of which she is certainly a very profitable Member. Adel. And pray what odd grave Fellow's that who follows alone? Cleon. One of Prince Thrasomond's Train, and his Governour. Agr. Why is that Prince a Boy? Cleon. Yes, he's a pretty forward Boy about four and twenty. Adel. That is a forward Boy indeed, when will he be a Man? Cleon. Never; he'll live a Boy till threescore, and then turn Child again. May you have your Desires, Ladies! Alga. Then you must sit down by us. Adel. With all our Hearts, Ladies. Gover. I will sit near this Lady. Mel. Not near me, Sir, but there's a Lady loves a Stranger, and you appear to me a very strange Fellow. Agr. Madam, how strange soever he is, he will not be so long, for I perceive he can quickly be acquainted. Adel. Peace, the King. Enter King, Thrasomond, Araminta, and Train. King. To give a stronger Testimony of Love Than only Promises (which commonly In Princes find at once both Birth and Burial) We've drawn you by our Letters, noble Prince To make here your Addresses to our Daughter, And your self known and lov'd by all our Subjects. As for this Lady Maid, whose Sex and Innocence Yet teach her nothing but her Fears and Blushes; I hope her Modesty so recommends her to you for a Wife, Were she not fair enough to be a Mistress. Lastly, my noble Son, (for so I now must call you) That I have done this publickly, is not To add a Comfort in particular To you or me, but all, and to confirm The Nobles and the Gentry of these Kingdoms By Oath to your Succession; this shall be Within a Week at most. Adel. This will be hardly done. Agr. It must be ill done whensoever it is done. Cleon. At least it will be but half done whilst so brave a Man is thrown off and living. Enter Philander. Officer. Make room there for the Lord Philander. Adel. Mark but the King how pale he looks with Fear. King. What brings him here? You're curious I find To see this Interview. Phil. The Wonders, Sir, your Majesty has often spoken in Praise Of Thrasomond, makes me desire to hear What he can say himself. Gover. Come, now begin. Thras. Kissing your white Hand, Mistress, I take leave. To thank your Royal Father, and thus far To be my own free Trumpet: Then observe, Great King, and these your Subjects, mine that must be, For so deserving you have spoke me, Sir, (And so deserving I dare speak my self;) To a Person of what Eminence, What Expectation, what Faculties, Manners and Virtues you will wed your Kingdoms; You have in me all you can wish. This Country By more than all my Hopes, I hold most happy In their dear Memories, that have been Kings Both great and good; happy in yours, that is, And from you (as a Chronicle to keep Your noble Name from eating Age,) do I Opine my self of all most happy, Sir. Believe me in a Word, a Princes Word, There shall be nothing to make up a Kingdom Mighty and flourishing, both fenc'd and fear'd, But thro' the Travels of my Life I'll find it, And tie it to this Country: And I vow My Reign shall be so easie to the Subjects, That every Man shall be his Prince himself, And his own Law, yet I his Prince and Law. And, dearest Lady, to your dearest Self; Dear in the Choice of him, (whose Name and Lustre Must make you more and mightier,) let me say, You are the blessed'st living: For, sweet Princess, You shall enjoy a Man to be your Servant, And you shall make him yours, for whom great Queens Must die and sigh.— Phil. Thou ugly silly Rogue. Cleon. I wonder what's his Price, for one may see He has a mind to sell him self by his Praises. Agr. Would I might die if I see any thing In him to raise him but to a Constable. Adel. Now do I fancy that this Speech was made by the Governour. Agr. O' my Conscience I think so too, for by his Action you might see the Fool did not understand what he said. Cleon. Well, we shall see more of it anon. Phil. May I beg leave, Sir, of your Majesty To speak a Word or two with this strange Prince? King. I give it you, but still remember that you are A Subject. Phil. Yes, Sir, I am so: And more a Slave to Araminta, And in spight of thee and Fate will be so ever. [Aside. Thus—I turn my self to you, big foreign Man, Ne'er stare, nor put on Wonder, for you must Endure me, and you shall. This Earth you tread on (A Dowry, as you hope, with this fair Princess, Whose very Name I bow to) was not left By my dead Father (O! I had a Father!) To your Inheritance; and I up and living, Having my self about me and my Sword, These Arms, and some few Friends besides the Gods, To part so calmly with it, and sit still; And say I might have been! I tell thee, Thrasomond, When thou art King, look I be dead and rotten, And my Name lost: Hear, hear me, Thrasomond, This very Ground thou go'st on, this fat Earth, My Father's Friends made fertile with their Faith, Before that Day of Shame shall gape, and swallow Thee and thy Nation, like a hungry Grave, Into her hidden Bowels; Prince, it shall, By Nemesis it shall. Cleon. Here's a Fellow has some Fire in his Veins. The Out-landish Prince looks like a Tooth-drawer. King. You do displease us; you're now too bold. Phil. No, Sir, I am too tame; Too much a Dove, a thing born without Passion; A very Shadow, that each drunken Cloud Sails over, and makes nothing. King. What means this? Call our Physicians; sure he's somewhat tainted. Adel. I do not think 'twill prove so. Cleon. 'Has given him a general Purge already, and now He means to let him Blood. Be constant, Gentlemen, By these Hilts I'll run his Hazard, tho' I run my Name Out of the Kingdom. Thras. Must I speake now? [To his Governour. Gov. Ay, ay, and do it home. Thras. What you have seen in me to stir Offence I cannot tell, except it be this Lady, Whom the King offer'd me without my seeking. And I expect he will secure her to me. Gov. You must be angry, Sir. Thras. Well then I will.— I value not whose Branch you are, my Blood And Person do deserve her well, and I Therefore assure you that she shall be mine. Phil. If thou wert sole Inheritor to him That once subdu'd the World, and could'st see no Sun Shine upon any thing but thine; were Thrasomond As truly valiant as I feel him cold, And ring'd among the choicest of his Friends, Such as would blush to talk such serious Follies, Or back such bellied Commendations. King. Sir, you wrong the Prince, I gave you not The Freedom here to brave our best of Friends; You deserve our Frown. Go to,—and be better temper'd. Phil. It must be, Sir, when I am nobler us'd. King. Tell me what you aim at in your Riddles. Phil. Had you my Eyes, Sir, and my Sufferings, My Griefs upon you, and my broken Fortunes, My Wants great, and now naught but Hopes and Fears, My Wrongs would make ill Riddles to be laugh'd at. King. Give me your Wrong in private. Phil. Take 'em them, [Whisper. And ease me of a Load would bow strong Atlas. Agr. He dares not stand the Shock. Cleon. I cannot blame him, there's Danger in it; every Man in this Age has not a Breast of Christal for all Men to read their Thoughts through. Mens Hearts and Faces are so far asunder, that they hold no Intelligence. Do but view your Stranger well, and you shall see a Fever thro' all his Bravery. If he give not back his Crown again on the Report of an Elder Gun, I have no Augury. King. Go to: Be more your self, as you expect Our Favour, else you will stir our Anger: I must have you know you are and and shall be at Our Pleasure: Smooth your Brow, or by the Gods— Phil. I'm dead, Sir, you're my Fate: It was not I Said I was wrong'd: I carry all about me My weak Stars lead me to; all my weak Fortunes. Who now, in all this Presence, dares (that is A man of Flesh, and is but mortal) tell me I do not most entirely love this Prince, And honour his full Virtues? King. He's possest. Phil. Yes, with my Father's Spirit. 'Tis here O King! A dangerous Spirit, now he tells me King, I was a King's Heir, bids me be a King, And whispers to me these are all my Subjects: 'Tis strange he will not let me sleep, but dives Into my Fancy, and there gives me Shapes, That kneel, and do me Service, call me King; But I'll suppress him, 'tis a Factious Spirit. King. I do not like this; I'll make you tamer, or I'll dispossess You both of Life and Spirit: For this Time I pardon your wild Speech, without so much As your Imprisonment. [Exeunt King, Thrasomond and Train. I thank you, Sir, you dare not for the People. Cleon. See how his Fancy labours: Has he not Spoke home and bravely? What a dangerous Train Did he give Fire to! How he shook the King! Made his Soul melt within him, and his Blood Run into Whey! It stood upon his Brows Like a cold Winter's Dew, Let's speak to him. Agr. How do you, worthy Sir? Phil. Well, very well; So well, that if it please the King, I may live Many Years. Cleon. The King must please, Whilst we know what you are, and who you are, Your Wrongs and Merits. Shrink not, noble Sir, But think still of your Father, in whose Name We'll waken all the Gods, and conjure up The Rods of Vengeance; th' abused People, Who like to raging Torrents shall swell high, And so begirt the Dens of these Male Dragons, That thro' the strongest Safety they shall beg For Mercy at your Sword's Point. Phil. Friends, no more: Our Ears may be corrupted: 'Tis an Age We dare not trust our Wills to: Do you love me? Cleon. Do we love Worth and Honour? Phil. I thank you, Sir; My Lord, pray is your Daughter living? Cleon. Yes; And for the Penance of an idle Dream Has undertaken a tedious Pilgrimage. Enter a Lady. Phil. Is it to me you come? Lady. To you, brave Lord. The Princess would intreat your Company. Phil. The Princess send for me? Sure you're mistaken. Lady. If you are called Philander. Phil. If she but now will love or kill me I am happy. I will this Moment attend thee to her. [Exit with Lady Cleon. Go on, and be as truly happy as th' art fearless. Come, Gentlemen, let us make our Friends acquainted. Lest the King prove false. [Exeunt. Enter Araminta and Lady. Ara. Will Philander come? Lady. Dear Madam, you were wont to credit me at first. Ara. But didst thou tell me he would come? How look'd he when he told thee he would come? Lady. Why well. Ara. And was he not a little fearful? Lady. How! fearful! sure he knows not what that is. Ara. You are all of his Faction, the whole Court Is bold in Praise of him! Lady. Madam, his Looks methought did shew much more Of Love than Fear. Ara. Of Love! To whom? To you? Lady. Madam, I mean to you. Ara. Of Love to me! Alas! Thy Ignorance Let's thee not see the Crossness of our Births. Nature that loves not to be questioned Why she did this or that, but has her Ends, And knows that she does well; never gave the World Two things so opposite, so contrary As he and I am. Lady. Madam, I think I hear him. Ara. Bring him in. Ye Gods! that will not have your Dooms withstood, Whose holy Wisdom, at this Time it is To make the Passion of a feeble Mind The Way to your great Justice. I obey. Enter Philander. Lady. Here is my Lord Philander. Ara. 'Tis well.—What shall I say? Phil. Madam, your Messenger Made me believe you sent to speak with me. Ara. 'Tis true, Philander, but the Words are such, So unbecoming of a Virgin's Mouth, That I could wish 'em said by any other Body. Can you not ghess what 'tis that I would say? Phil. When I behold That heav'nly Frame, I find such Sweetness there, I cannot think you guilty of a Thought Which has a Harshness in it, much less a Cruelty. But then, when I consider who you are, And what your Father is, how can I chuse But fear you must intend my utter Ruin. Ara. You are not well acquainted with my Thoughts, Tho' they are such as make me blush as oft As I would fain discover them to you; Yet for my Life I cannot think them ill, Nor wish them other, than what just they are. Phil. Why won't you tell them then? Ara. Because I dare not tell them. Phil. Yes you may: Let them be ne'er so cruel, I will hear My Doom with Patience, and obey it too. Say you would have my Life, I'll give it you; For 'tis of me a Thing so loath'd, and of So small a Use to you, who ask it of me, That I shall make no Price if you would have it. Ara. Why then it is your Life that I must have, Your whole entire Life, or lose my own. Phil. I gladly thus resign it to you: Here Draw this and kill me; I shall thank you for it: For since my cruel Fortune has decreed, That you must never, Madam, give Consent To what alone can make me live with Ease, The dying by your Hand is all I covet. Ara. Oh! 'tis not so, Philander, that I mean; Kill you! no, I'd sooner die my self Than offer you but once the least Offence. Why I would rather kill my self than live, If be my Fate that you would have it so. By all the holy Powers I would. Good Gods! Cannot you ghess my meaning yet. Phil. Oh Heavens! What is't she means! It cannot sure be Love; And yet she is too full of noble Thoughts To lay a Train for this contemned Life, Which she might have for asking: Madam, you Perplex my Mind so much with what you say, I know not what to think; I know well what To wish for; I so earnestly do wish it That indeed I can think of nothing else. 'Twas not the Fear of losing of a Crown That gave my Tongue such Rage before you This Day. The Crown's a thing of which I feel no Want, But that I have it not to offer you. There is another Fear lies deeper here, The Fear of losing that on which my Life Depends; and which I ne'er shall tamely part with: For, Madam, know, while poor Philander lives, 'Tis but in vain your Father shall pretend To marry you to any but— Ara. But to whom? Phil. But to him who wants the Impudence to hope So great a Blessing: One who harbours Thoughts Of what he is so mean and humble in Respect of you, that were his Council ask'd Whether or no you ought to make him happy, He fears he hardly could advise you to it; Who is however still resolved to die, Before he sees you given to another, And therefore on his Knees begs you to kill him. Ara. Another Soul into my Body shot, Could not have warm'd my Heart with more new Life Than these your Words have done; had you but staid A little longer I had vow'd the same; But I am wretched now, unless you love me. Phil. Love you! My Soul adores you with so strong a Zeal, So far above the Rate of common Love, That mine deserves a more exalted Name, If any more exalted I could find. Ara. I have then no more to ask of Heav'n; And sure our Love will meet the greater Blessing, In that the greatest Justice of the Gods Is blended with it: But you must not stay, Lest some unwelcome Guest should find you here. Think how we may continue a secret Way To keep Intelligence betwixt us, that On all Occasions we may both agree, Which Path is best to tread. Phil. I have a Boy Sent by the Gods, I think, for this Intent, Not yet seen in the Court. Hunting the Buck, I found him sitting by a Fountain side, Of which he borrow'd some to quench his Thirst, And paid the Nymph again as much in Tears: A Garland by him lay, made by him self, Of many several Flowers he'd in the Bay Stuck in that mystick Order, that the Rareness Delighted me; but ever when he turn'd His tender Eyes upon them, he would weep, As if he meant to make them grow again. Seeing such pretty helpless Innocence Dwell in his Face, I ask'd him of his Story. He told me that his Parents lately dy'd, Leaving him to the Mercy of the Field, Which gave him Roots, and of the Christal Springs, Which did not stop their Streams; and of the Sun, Which still, he thank'd him, yielded him his Light. I gladly entertain'd him, who was as glad to follow; And I've got the truest and most faithful Boy alive, Him will I send to bear our hidden Love. Enter Lady. Lady. Madam, the Prince is come to kiss your Hands. Ara. For Heaven's Sake, dear Philander, hide your self. Phil. Hide me from Thrasomond! when Thunder roars, Which is Jove's Voice, tho' Jove I do revere, I hide me not; shall then a foreign Prince Have leave to brag to any foreign Nation, That he did make Philander hide himself? Ara. Why then say nothing to him, Phil. I'll obey. Enter Thrasomond. Thras. My Princely Mistress, as true Lovers ought, I came to kiss those fair Hands, and to shew, In outward Ceremonies, the dear Love, Writ here within my Heart. Phil. If I can have no other Answer I am gone. Thras. To what would he have Answer? Ara. To his Claim, as he pretends, to his Father's Crown. Thra. Sir, I did let you alone to day before the King. Phil. Sir, do so still, I would not talk with you. Thras. But now the Time is fit. Do but name the least Pretence or Title to a Crown. Phil. Peace, Thrasomond,—if thou— Ara. Philander, hold.— Phil. I have done. Thras. You're gone, I'll fetch you back again. Phil. You shall not need. Thras. What now? Phil. Know, Thrasomond, I loath to brawl with such a Blast as thou, Who art nothing but a valiant Voice: But if Thou shalt provoke me farther, Men shall say, Thou wert, and not lament it. Thras. Do you slight my Greatness so? And in the Chamber of the Princess? Phil. It is a Place, to which I must confess, I owe a Reverence. But wer't in a Church, Nay, at an Altar; there's no Place so safe, Where thou dar'st injure me, but I dare kill thee; And for your Greatness know, Sir, I can grasp You and your Greatness thus, thus into nothing: Give me not a Word back.—farewell. [Exit. Thras. 'Tis an odd Fellow this as e'er I saw. I'll stop his Mouth hereafter with some Office. Ara. You had best to make him your Councellor. Thras. I think he would discharge it well. But Madam, I hope our Hearts are knit; but yet so slow The Ceremonies of State are, that 'twill be long Before our Hands be so, therefore now, Without expecting farther Ceremonies, Let us enjoy some stoln Delights together. Ara. Since you dare utter this I must withdraw. [Exit. Thras. Nay, if you are so squeamish thank your self, If I should try elsewhere. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Scene I. Enter Philander, Endymion. Phil. And thou shalt find her honourable, Boy, Full of Regard unto thy tender Youth, For thy own Modesty, and for my Sake, Apter to give than thou wilt be to ask. End. Sir, you did take me up when I was nothing; And only yet am something by being yours; You trusted me unknown; and that which you Were apt to construe Innocence in me, Might have been Craft; the Cunning of a Boy Harden'd in Lies and Theft; yet ventur'd you To part my Miseries and me; for which, I never can expect to serve a Lady That bears more Honour in her Breast than you. Phil. But, Boy, it will prefer thee, thou art young, And bear'st a childish overflowing Love To them that speak thee fair; when thy Age And Judgment once shall end those Passions, Thou wilt remember best these careful Friends That plac'd thee in the noblest Way of Life; She is a Princess I prefer thee to. End. In that small Time that I have seen the World, I never knew a Man hasty to part With Servants he thought trusty: I remember My Father would prefer the Boys he kept To greater Men than he; but did it not Till they were grown too saucy for himself. Phil. Why, gentle Boy, I find no Fault at all In thy Behaviour. End. Sir, if I have made A Fault of Ignorance, instruct my Youth, I shall be willing, if not apt to learn; Age and Experience will adorn my Mind With larger Knowledge; and if I have done A wilful Fault, think me not past all Hope For once; what Master holds so strict a Hand Over his Boy, that he will part with him Without one Warning? Let me be corrected To break my Stubborness, if it be so, Rather than turn me off, and I shall mend. Phil. Thy Love doth plead so prettily to stay. That, trust me, I could weep to part with thee. Alas! I do not turn thee off; thou know'st It is my Business that doth call thee hence, And when thou art with her, thou dwell'st with me: Think so, and 'tis so: and when Time is full, And thou hast well discharg'd this heavy Trust. Laid on so weak a one, I will again With Joy receive thee; as I live I will: Nay, weep not, gentle Boy, 'tis more than Time Thou did'st attend the Princess. End. I am gone; But since I am to part with you, my Lord, And none knows whether I shall live to do More Service for you, take this little Pray'r; Heav'n bless your Loves, your Fights, all your Designs; May sick Men, if they have your Wish be well; And Heav'n hate those you curse, tho' I be one. [Exit. Phil. The Love of Boys unto their Lords is strange, I have read Wonders of it; yet this Boy, For my Sake (if a Man may judge by Looks And Speech) would outdo their Story: I may see A Day to pay him for his Loyalty. [Exit. Enter Araminta and a Lady. Ara. Where is the Boy? Lady. I think within, Madam. Ara. But are his Cloaths made yet? Lady. He has 'em on. Ara. 'Tis a pretty sad talking Boy this, is He not? I would fain know his Name. Lady. Endymion, Madam. Enter Melesinda. Ara. Oh, you are welcome: What good News? Mel. As good as any one can tell your Highness, That says she has done that you would have wish'd. Ara. Hast thou discover'd? Mel. Yes, I have strain'd a Point Of Modesty for you. Ara. I prithee how? Mel. In list'ning after Baudry. I perceive Let a Lady live never so modestly, She will be sure to meet one Time or other With Opportunities of hearing that. Your Prince, brave Thrasomond, has been so amorous, And in so excellent a Stile! Ara. With whom? Mel. Why with the Lady that I did suspect. I am inform'd both of the Time and Place. Ara. O when! and where! Mel. To Night: Her Chamber. Ara. Run Thy self into the Presence; mingle there With other Ladies, leave the rest to me. If Destiny (to whom we dare not say Why thou did'st this) have not decreed it so, In lasting Leaves, (whose smallest Characters Were never alter'd) then this Match shall break. Where is the Boy? Lady. Here, Madam. Enter Endymion. Ara. You are sad, I see, to change your Service, is't not so? End. Madam, I have not chang'd; I wait on you To do him Service. Ara. Thou disclaim'st me then? Philander told me thou canst sing and play. End. If Grief will give me leave, Madam, I can. Ara. Alas, what kind of Grief can thy Years know? Was't a curst Master that thou hadst at School? Thou art not capable of other Grief. Thy Brows and Cheeks are smooth as Waters be, When no Breath troubles them; believe me, Boy, Care seeks out wrinkled Brows and hollow Eyes, And builds himself Caves to abide in them. Come, Sir, pray, tell me truly, does your Lord Love me? End. I know not, Madam, what Love is. Ara. Canst thou know Grief, and never yet knew'st Love? Thou art deceiv'd, Boy; does he speak of me As if he wish'd me well? End. If it be Love To lose the Memory of all things else, To forget all Respect of his own Friends, In thinking of your Face; if it be Love To sit cross-arm'd, and sigh away the Day, Mingled with Starts, crying your Name as loud And hastily as Men i'th' Streets do Fire: If it be Love to weep himself away, When he but hears of any Lady dead Or kill'd, because it might have been your Chance; If when he goes to rest, (which will not be) 'Twixt ev'ry Prayer he says, to name you once, As others drop a Bead, be any Sign Of Love, then, Madam, I dare swear he loves you. Ara. O y' are a cunning Boy, and taught to lie For your Lord's Service: But thou know'st a Lie That bears this Sound is welcomer to me, Than any Truth, that says he loves me not. Lead the Way, Boy; do you attend me too; 'Tis thy Lord's Business hastes me thus away. [Exeunt. Enter Cleon, Agremont, Adelard, Alga, Melesinda. Cleon. Come, Ladies, shall we talk a Round? As Men Do walk a Mile Women should talk an Hour, After Supper 'tis their Exercise. Mel. 'Tis late. Alga. 'Tis all My Eyes will do to lead me to my Bed. [Exeunt. Enter King, Araminta, and a Guard. King. You Gods, I see, that who unrighteously Holds Wealth or State from others, shall be curst In that which meaner Men are blest withal: Ages to come shall know no Male of him Left to inherit, and his Name shall be Blotted from Earth; if he have any Child, It shall be crossly match'd: The Gods themselves Shall sow Division 'twixt her Lord and her. Yet, if it be your Wills, forgive the Faults Which I have done; let not your Vengeance fall Upon this understanding Child of mine: She has not broke your Laws; but how can I Look to be heard of Gods, who must be just, Praying upon the Ground I hold by Wrong? Enter Cleon. Cleon. Sir, I have ask'd her Women, but they, I think, are Bauds: I told them I must speak with her; they laugh'd, and said their Mistress lay speechless: I said my Business was important; they said their Lady was about it: I grew hot, and cry'd my Business was a Matter that concern'd Life and Death; they answer'd, so was that which their Mistress was a doing. Answers more direct I could not get: In short, Sir, I conceive she is very well employ'd. King. 'Tis then no time to dally: You o'th' Guard, Wait at the Back-door of Alga's Lodgings, And see that none pass thence upon your Lives, But bring them to me whosoe'er they be: Knock, Gentlemen, knock louder, louder yet: What has their Pleasure ta'en away their Hearing? Maid. Who's there that knocks so at the dead of Night? Cleon. Some Friends that are come here to pay you a Visit. Enter the Guard, bringing in Thrasomond, in Drawers, muffiled up in a Cloak. Guard. Sir, in obedience to your Commands, We stopt this Fellow stealing out of Doors. [They pull off his Cloak, Agr. Who's this, the Prince? Cleon. Yes; he's incognito. King. Sir, I must chide you for this Looseness: You've wrong'd a worthy Lady; but no more. Thras. Sir I came hither but to take the Air. Cleon. A witty Rogue, I warrant him. Agr. I, he's a Devil at his Answers. King. Conduct him to his Lodgings. Come, Sirs, break open the Doors. Maid. You shall not enter here. Agr. We must, and will. Alga. Nay, let 'em enter; I am up, and ready; I know the Business they come hither for, 'Tis the poor breaking of a Lady's Honour They hunt so after; let 'em have their Wills. My Lord, the King, this is not noble in you, To publish thus the Weakness of a Woman. King. Come down. Alga. I dare, my Lord, for all your Whispers; This your base Carriage shall not startle me: But I have Vengeance still in Store for some, That shall, in Spight of this your great Design, Be Joy and Nourishment to all the Nation. King. Will you come down? Alga. I will to laugh at you. I'll vex you to the Heart, if my Skill fail not. Cleon. 'Tis strange that a Lady cannot ride a Heat or two to breath her self, but she must be ruin'd for't. If this Geer holds, that Lodgings be search'd thus, Pray Heav'n we may lye with our own Wives quietly. Enter Alga. King. Good Madam Alga, where's your Honour now? No Man can fit your Pallat but the Prince: Thou most ill-shrouded Rottenness, thou Piece Made by a Painter and Apothecary, Had'st thou none to allure unto thy Lust, But he that must be wedded to my Daughter? By all the Gods, all these, and all the Pages Shall whoot you thro' the Court; what do you laugh? Alga. Faith, Sir, your Majesty must pardon me, I cannot chuse but laugh to see you merry. If you do this, O King, or dare to think on't, By all those Gods you swore by, and as many More of my own, I will have Fellows with me, Such Fellows as shall make you noble Mirth: The Princess, your dear Daughter, shall stand by me, She shall be whooted at as well as I. Urge me no farther, Sir, I know her Haunts, Her Layes and Leaps, and will discover all; Nay, will dishonour her: I know the Boy She keeps; a handsome Boy about eighteen; Can tell what she does with him; where and when. Come, Sir, you put me to a Woman's Madness, The Glory of a Fury; and if I Don't do it to the Height— King. What Boy is this? Alga. Good-minded Prince, alas Sir, you know nothing; I'm loth to utter more. Keep in this Fault, As you would keep your Health, from the hot Air Of the corrupted People; or by Heav'n I will not fall alone: What I have known Shall be as publick as a Print; nay, as Your Counsels, and by all as freely laught at. King. Has she a Boy? Agr. I think I've seen one, Sir, That waits upon her. King. Get you to your Quarter; For this Time I will study to forget you. Alga. Do you study to forget me, and I'll study to forget you. [Exeunt King, Alga and Guard. Agr. Why here's a Male Spirit for Hercules! If ever there be nine Worthies of Women this Wench shall ride astride, and be their Captain. Cleon. Sure she has a Garrison of Devils in her Tongue; she utter'd such Balls of Wild-fire, that all the Doctors in the Country will scarce cure him: That Boy was a strange found out Antidote to cure her Infection, That Boy, that Princess's Boy, that brave, chaste, virtuous Lady's Boy, and a fair Boy, a well-spoken Boy: All these considered can make nothing else —But there I'll leave you, Gentlemen, Adel. Nay, we'll go wander with you. [Exeunt. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Scene I. Enter Cleon, Agremont, Adelard. Agr. Nay, doubtless it is true. Cleon. I and the Gods Have rais'd this Punishment to scourge the King With his own Issue: Is it not a Shame For us that should be Freemen, to behold A Man that is the Bravery of his Age, Philander, prest down from his Royal Right By this regardless King; and only look And see the Scepter ready to be cast Into the Hands of that lascivious Lady, That lives in Lust with a smooth Boy, now to be Marry'd to yon' strange Prince, who, but that People Please to let him be a Prince, is born a Slave In that which should be his most noble Part, His Mind. Adel. That Man that will not stir with you To aid Philander, let the Gods forget That such a Creature walks upon the Earth. Agr. Philander is too backward in't himself; The Gentry all wait for him, and the People, Against their Nature long to be in Arms; And like a Field of standing Corn, that moves With a stiff Gale, their Heads bow all one Way. Cleon. The only Cause that draws Philander back From this Attempt is the fair Princess, whom I fear he loves. Adel. He'll not believe it then. Cleon. Why, Gentlemen, 'tis without Question so. Agr. 'Tis most true, she lives dishonestly; But how shall we, if he be doubtful, work Upon his Faith. Adel. Every one knows 'tis true. Cleon. Since 'tis so, and tends to his own good, I'll make this new Report to be my Knowledge. I'll say I knew it; nay, I'll swear I saw it. Agr. It will be best, Adel. Yes sure, it must needs move him. Cleon. Nothing but this will force him into Action. Enter Philander. See, here he comes. Good morrow to your Grace; We have been waiting for you. Phil. Worthy Friends, You that can keep your Memories to know Your Friends in Miseries, and cannot frown On Men disgrac'd for Virtue; a good Day Attend you all: What Service may I do, Worthy your Expectation? Cleon. My good Lord, We come to urge that Virtue (which we know Lives in your Breast) forth; rise, and make a Head: The Nobles and the People are all dull'd With this usurping King; and not a Man That ever heard or knew of such a Thing As Virtue, but will second your Attempts. Phil. How honourable is this Love in you To me that have deserv'd none? Know, my Friends, (You that were born to shame your poor Philander With too much Kindness) know I could afford To melt my self in Thanks; But my Designs Are not yet ripe: Let it suffice, e'er long I shall employ you; but the Time's not come. Cleon. The Time is fitter some than you expect; That which hereafter hardly will be reach'd By Violence, may now be caught with Ease. As for the King, you know the People long Did hate him; but the Princess now— Phil. Why, what Of her, I pray? Cleon. Is loath'd as much as he. Phil. By what strange Means? Cleon. She's known a Whore. Phil. Thou ly'st, [Offers to draw; is held. And thou shalt feel thou dost, I thought thy Mind Was full of Honour; thus to rob a Lady Of her good Name is an infectious Sin Not to be pardon'd; be it false as Hell, 'Twill never be redeem'd if it be sown Among the People, fruitful to increase All Evil they shall hear. Let me alone, That I may cut off Falshood while it springs: Set Hills on Hills betwixt me and the Man That utters this, and I will scale them all, And from the utmost Top fall on his Neck Like Thunder from a Cloud. Cleon. This is most strange. Sir, though you love her— Phil. No, Sir, I love Truth; She is my Mistress; and who injures her Draws Vengeance from me: Sirs, let go my Arms. Adel. Nay, good my Lord, be patient. Agr. Sir, remember This is your honour'd Friend, the good Lord Cleon, That comes to do you Service, and will shew You why he utter'd this. Phil. I ask your Pardon; My Zeal to Truth made me unmannerly: Should I have heard Dishonour spoke of you Behind your Back, untruly, I had been As much distemper'd and enrag'd as now. Cleon. But this is true. Phil. O, good Sir, say not so. Is it then true all Woman-kind is false. Urge it no more; it is impossible; Why should you think the Princess could be light? Cleon. Because, Sir, she was taken in the Fact. Phil. 'Tis false; Oh Heav'n! 'tis false: It cannot be; Can it? Speak, Gentlemen, for the Love of Truth; Is't possible all Women should be damn'd? Cleon. Why no, my Lord. Phil. Why then it cannot be. Cleon. And she was taken with her Boy. Phil. What Boy? Cleon. A Page; a Boy that serves her. Phil. Oh, Good Gods! A little Boy! Cleon. Ay; Know you him, my Lord? Phil. Sin and Hell: Know him! Sir, you are deceiv'd: I'll reason it a little coldly with you: If she were lustful, would she take a Boy That knows not yet Desire? She would have one Should meet her Thoughts, and know the Sin he acts, Which is the great Delight of Wickedness: You are abus'd, and so is she and I. Cleon. How you, my Lord? Phil. Why, all the World's abus'd In an unjust Report. Cleon. Your Virtues, Sir, Cannot look through the subtile Thoughts of Woman: In short, my Lord, I took 'em; I, my self. Phil. Now all the Devils, thou did'st! Fly from my Rage: Would thou had'st taken Fiends ingendring Plagues, When thou did'st take 'em; hide thee from my Eyes: Would thou had'st taken Thunder on thy Breast When thou did'st take 'em, or been strucken dumb, That so this Deed for ever might have slept In Silence. Adel. Have you known him so ill temper'd? Agr. Never before. Phil. The Winds that are set loose From the four several Corners of the World, And spread themselves all over Sea and Land, Kiss not a chaste one. What Friend bears a Sword To run me through? Cleon. Why are you mov'd at this? Phil. When any falls from Virtue I am mad; I am distracted; I've an Interest in't. Cleon. But, Good my Lord, recall your self, and think What's to be done. Phil. I thank you: I will do't. Please you to leave me, I'll consider on't: To-morrow I will give you all my Answer. Cleon. The Gods direct you. [Ex. Cleon. Adel. Agr. Phil. I had forgot to ask him where he took 'em: I'll follow him. O that I had a Sea Within my Breast, to quench the Fire I feel! More Circumstances will but fan this Fire: It more afflicts me now to know by whom This Deed is done, than simply that 'tis done: And he that tells me this is honourable, As far from Lies, as she is far from Truth. O that, like Beasts, we could not grieve our selves With that we see not! Bulls and Rams will fight To keep their Females standing in their Sight; But take them from 'em, and you take at once Their Spleens away, and they will fall again Unto their Pastures, growing fresh and fat, And taste the Waters of the Springs as sweet As 'twas before, finding no Start in Sleep: But miserable Man,—See, see, you Gods! Enter Endymion. He walks still, and the Face you let him wear When he was innocent, is still the same! Not blasted! Is this Justice? Do you mean T'intrap Mortality, that you allow Treason so smooth a Brow? I cannot now Think he is guilty. End. Health to you, my Lord: The Princess doth commend her Love, her Life, And this unto you. Phil. Oh, Endymion, Now I perceive she loves me; she doth shew it In loving thee, my Boy; she has made thee brave. End. My Lord, she has attir'd me past my Wish, And past my Merit, fit for her Attendant, Tho' far unfit for me who do attend. Phil. Thou art grown courtly, Boy, O let all Women, That love black Deeds, learn to dissemble here; Here, by this Paper, she does write to me, As if her Heart were Mines of Adamant To all the World besides, but unto me A Maiden Snow, that melted with my Looks. Tell me, my Boy, how doth the Princess use thee? For I shall ghess her Love to me by that. End. Scarce like her Servant, but as if I were Something ally'd to her, or had preserv'd Her Fame or Life, with Hazard of my own; As Mothers fond do use their only Sons; As I'd use one that's left unto my Trust, For whom my Life should pay if he met harm. Phil. Why this is wondrous well, Endymion; but What Language, preethee, doth she feed thee with? End. Why, she doth tell me, she will trust my Youth With all her loving Secrets, and does call me Her pretty Servant; bids me weep no more For leaving you, she'll see my Services Rewarded; and such Words, of that soft Strain, That I am nearer weeping when she ends, Than e'er she does begin. Phil. So, so! This is Much better still. End. Are not you well, my Lord? Phil. Well! Yes, Endymion. End. Methinks your Words Fall not from of your Tongue so evenly, Nor is there in your Looks that Quietness That I was wont to see. Phil. Thou art deceiv'd, My Boy. And she does stroke thy Head? End. Why, yes. Phil. And she does kiss thee? Ha? End. How's that, my Lord? Phil. She kisses thee, my Boy. End. Not so, my Lord. Phil. Come, come, I know she doth. End. No, by my Life. Phil. Why then she does not love me; come she does, I bade her do it; I charg'd her by all Charms Of Love between us, by the Hope of Peace We should enjoy, to yield thee all Delights, Naked, as to her Bed: I took her Oath Thou should'st enjoy her: Tell me, Boy, is she Not far above compare? Is not her Breath Sweet as Arabian Winds, when Fruits are ripe? Are not her Breasts two liquid Ivory Balls? Is she not all a lasting Mine of Joy? End. I, now I see why my disturbed Thoughts Were so perplex'd; when first I went to her My Heart held Augury: You are abus'd, Some Villain has abus'd you; I do see Whereto you tend: Fall Rocks upon his Head That put this in you; 'tis some subtil Train To bring that noble Frame of yours to nought. Phil. Thou think'st I will be angry with thee; come, Thou shalt know all my Drift; I hate her more Than I love Happiness, and plac'd thee there To pry with narrow Eyes into her Deeds. Hast thou discover'd? Has she fall'n to Lust, As I would wish her? Speak some Comfort to me. End. My Lord, you did mistake the Boy you sent: Had she the Lust of Sparrows or of Goats; Had she a Sin that way hid from the World, Beyond the Name of Lust; I would not aid Her base Desires; but what I came to know, As Servant to her, I would not reveal, To make my Life last Ages. Phil. Oh my Heart! This is a Salve worse than the main Disease. Tell me thy Thoughts, for I will know the least That dwells within thee, or will rip thy Heart To know it: I will see thy Thoughts as plain As I do now thy Face. End. Why, so you do. She is (for ought I know) by all the Gods, As chaste as Ice; but were she foul as Hell, And I did know it thus; the Breath of Kings, The Points of Swords, Tortures, nor Bulls of Brass, Should draw it from me. Phil. Then it is not time To dally with thee; I will take thy Life, For I do hate thee: I could curse thee now. End. If you do hate me, you can't curse me worse: The Gods have not a Punishment in Store Greater for me, my Lord, than is your Hate. Phil. Fie, fie, so young, and so dissembling too! Tell me both when and where thou didst enjoy her, Or Plagues fall on thee if I kill thee not. End. Heav'n knows I never did: And when I lie To save my Life, may I live long and loath'd. Hew me asunder, and I'll love the Limbs Which you cut off, better than those that grow: And kiss them dead, because you made 'em so. Phil. Fear'st thou not Death? Can Boys contemn that? End. Oh, What Boy is he, can be content to live To be a Man that sees the very best Of Men thus passionate, thus without Reason? Phil. Oh, but thou dost not know what 'tis to die. End. Yes but I do, my Lord, I know it well: 'Tis less than to be born; a lasting Sleep, A quiet resting from all Jealousie, A thing we all pursue: I know besides, 'Tis but the giving up a Game which must be lost. Phil. But there are Pains, false Boy, for perjur'd Souls; Think but on them, and then thy Heart will melt. End. May they fall all upon me whilst I live, If I be perjur'd, or have ever thought Of that you charge me with; if I be false, Send me to suffer in those Punishments You speak of: Kill me. Phil. Oh, what should I do? Why, who can but believe him? He does swear So earnestly, if it were not true, The Gods would not endure him. Rise Endymion, Thy Protestations are so deep, and thou Dost look so truly when thou utter'st them, That, tho' I know 'em false as were my Hopes, I cannot urge thee farther: But thou wert To blame to injure me; for I must love Thy honest Looks, and never take Revenge Upon thy tender Youth: A Love from me to thee Is firm, whate'er thou dost. It troubles me That I have call'd the Blood out of thy Cheeks, That did so well become them; but, good Boy, Let me not see thee more; something is done That will distract me; that will raise a Storm Within my Breast too great for me to quell, If thou com'st near me. End. I will fly as far As there is Morning, e'er I give distaste To that most honour'd Mind. But thro' these Tears, Shed at my hopeless parting, I can see A World of Treason practic'd upon you, And her, and me. Farewel for evermore; If you shall hear that Sorrow struck me dead, And after find me loyal, let there be A Tear, at least, shed by you for me; and I then shall rest in Peace. [Exit. Phil. Blessings be with thee, Whatever thou deserv'st. Oh where shall I Go bathe this Body? Nature too unkind, That made no Med'cine for a troubled Mind. [Exit. Enter Araminta. Ara. I marvel my Boy comes not back again; But that I know my Love will question him Over and over, how I slept, wak'd, talk'd; How often his dear Name was mentioned by me; How I sigh'd, wept, and sung, and thousand more Such things; I should be angry at his Stay. Enter King. King. What at your Meditations? Who is with you? Ara. None but my single self; I need no Guard: I do no wrong, nor fear none. King. Have you not a Boy? Ara. Yes, Sir. King. What kind of Boy? Ara. A waiting Boy. King. A handsome Boy? Ara. A very handsome Boy. King. He talks and sings, and plays? Ara. I think he does. King. About eighteen? Ara. I never ask'd his Age. King. Pray, is he full of Service? Ara. Why do you ask? King. Put him away. Ara. How, Sir? King. Put him away. 'Has done you that good Service, I'm asham'd To speak of. Ara. Good Sir, let me understand you. King. If you fear me, shew it in Duty; put Away that Boy. Ara. Let me have reason for it, And then your Will to me shall be a Law. King. Do not you blush to ask it? Cast him off, Or I shall do the same to you: Y' are one Shame with me, and so near unto my self, That, by my Life, I dare scarce tell my self What you have done. Ara. What have I done, my Lord? King. It is a Language that all love to learn; The common People speak it well already: They need no Grammar; understand me well, There be foul Whispers stirring; cast him off, And suddenly I charge you do't, Farewel. [Exit. Ara. Where may a Maiden live securely free, Keeping her Honour safe? Not with the living, They feed upon Opinions, Errors, Dreams, And make 'em Truths: They draw a Nourishment Out of defaming, grow upon Disgraces, And when they see a Virtue fortify'd Strongly, above the Batt'ry of their Tongues, Oh, how they cast about to ruin it! Enter Philander. Phil. Peace be to your fair Thoughts, my dearest Mistress. Ara. O dear Philander, I've a War within me. Phil. He must be more than Man that makes these Chrystals Run into Rivers: Sweetest Fair, the Cause? And as I am your Slave, ty'd to your Goodness, Your Creature made again from what I was, And newly spirited: I'll right your Honour. Ara. Oh, my best Love, that pretty Boy— Phil. What Boy? Ara. The pretty Boy you gave me. Phil. What of him? Ara. Must be no more mine. Phil. Why? Ara. They're jealous of him. Phil. Who's jealous? Ara. The King is. Phil. Oh my Fortune! Then 'tis no idle Story. Let him go. Ara. Oh cruel! what are you hard-hearted too? Who now shall bring you word how much I love you? Who now shall weep to you the Tears I send? Who now shall give you Letters, Rings, and Bracelets? Waste tedious Nights in Stories of your Praise? And throw away his Health in serving you? Who shall take up his Lute, and singing to it, Charm me asleep, making me dream, and cry Oh my dear, dear Philander? Phil. Oh my Heart! Would he had broken thee, that made thee know This Lady was not true. Madam, forget This Boy; I'll get you one a great deal better. Ara. Oh, never, never such a Boy again As my Endymion is. Phil. 'Tis but your Fancy. Ara. With thee, my Boy, farewel for evermore All Secrecy in Servants; farewel Faith, And all Desire to do well, for it self: Let all that shall succeed thee, for thy Wrongs, Betray chaste Love. Phil. And all this Passion for A Boy? Ara. He was your Boy; you put him to me: The Loss of such a one requires a Mourning. Phil. Oh, thou forgetful Woman! Ara. How, my Lord? Phil. False Araminta; thou hast quite undone me. Hast thou a Med'cine to restore my Wits Again, when I have lost 'em? Oh you Gods! Give me a worthy Patience: Have I stood Alone the Shock of all the worst Misfortunes? Have I seen Mischiefs numberless and mighty Grow like a Sea upon me? Have I taken Dangers as stern as Death into my Bosom, And laugh'd upon 'em, made 'em but a Mirth, And flung 'em off? Do I live under this Usurping King, like one, who languishing, Hears his sad Bell, and sees his Mourners by? Do I bear all this bravely, and must sink At length under a Woman's Falshood? O, That Boy, that cursed Boy! None but a Boy To ease your Lust? Ara. Why, did he tell you so? Phil. It may be he did. Ara. Alas, then I'm undone: I see the Plot cast for my Overthrow. Phil. Now you may take that little Right I have To this poor Kingdom; give it to your Joy, For I have no Joy in it. Some far Place, Where never Womankind durst set her Foot, I'll seek to curse you in. Ara. Oh, I am wretched! Phil. There dig a Cave, and preach to Birds and Beasts, What Woman is, and help to save 'em from you: How Heav'n is in your Eyes; but in your Hearts More Hell than Hell has; how your Tongues like Scorpions, Both heal and poison; how your Thoughts are woven With thousand Changes in one subtil Web, And woven so by you: How that foolish Man That reads the Story of a Woman's Face, And dies believing it, is lost for ever. How all the good you have is but a Shadow; I'th' morning with you, and at night behind you, Past and forgotten. How your Vows are Frosts, Fast for a Night, and with the next Sun gone. How you are, being taken all together, A meer Confusion, and so dead a Chaos, Truth's Love can distinguish nothing in you. These Sad Texts till my last Hour I'm bound to utter. So farewel all my Woe, all my Delight. [Exit. Ara. Be merciful, you Gods, and strike me dead; What way have I deserv'd this? Make my Breast Transparent as pure Christal, that the World, Jealous of me, may see the foulest Thought My Heart does hold. Where shall a Woman turn Her Eyes to find out Constancy? Save me! Enter Endymion. How black, methinks, that guilty Boy looks now! Oh, thou Dissembler! that before thou spak'st Wer't in thy Cradle false! sent to make Lies, And betray Innocents: Thy Lord and thou May glory in the Ashes of a Maid, Fool'd by her Passion; but the Conquest is Nothing so great as wicked. Fly away, Let my Command force thee to that, which Shame Should do without it. If thou understood'st The loathed Office thou hast undergone, Why, thou would'st hide thee under Heaps of Hills, Lest Men should dig, and find thee. End. Oh, what God, Angry with Men, hath sent this strange Disease Into the noblest Minds? Madam, this Grief You add unto me, is no more than Drops To Seas, for which they are not seen to swell: My Lord hath struck his Anger through my Heart, And let out all the Hopes of of future Joys. You need not bid me fly; I came to part, To take my latest Leave: Farewel for ever. I durst not run away, in Honesty, From such a Lady, like a Boy that stole, Or made some grievous Fault; the Pow'r of Gods Assist you in your Suff'rings; hasty Time Reveal the Truth to your abused Lord, And mine: That he may know your worth; whilst I Go seek out some forgotten Place to die. [Exit. Ara. Peace guide thee, thou hast overthrown me once, Yet if I had another Troy to lose, Thou or another Villain, with thy Looks, Might talk me out of it, and send me with My Hair dishevel'd, through the fiery Streets. Enter a Lady. Lady. Madam, the King has sent for you in haste To go abroad with him. Ara. Whither, d'ye know? Lady. A Hunting, Madam. Ara. I'm in tune to Hunt. Diana, if thou canst rage with a Maid, As with a Man, let me discover thee Bathing, and turn me to a fearful Hinde, That I may die, pursu'd by cruel Hounds, And have my Story written in my Wounds. [Exeunt. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV. Scene I. Enter Philander. Phil. Oh that I had been nourish'd in these Woods With Milk of Goats and Acorns, and not known The Right of Crowns, nor the dissembling Trains Of Women's Looks; but dig'd my self a Cave, Where I my Fire, my Cattle and my Bed Might have been shut together in one Shed; And then have taken me some Mountain Girl, Beaten with Winds, chaste as the hardned Rocks Whereon she dwells; that might have strew'd my Bed With Leaves and Reeds, and with the Skins of Beasts, And born at her big Breasts my large course Issue. This had been a Life free from Vexation. Enter Endymion. End. Oh wicked Men! an Innocent may walk Safe among Beasts; nothing assaults me here. See! there my troubled Lord sits, as his Soul Were searching out a way to leave his Body. It grieves me that I'm forc'd to disobey His lasts Commands; but 'tis not in my Pow'r To forbear speaking, when I look on him. I'll make as if I wanted, tho' Heav'n knows I can't, because I do not wish to live. You that are griev'd can pity; hear, my Lord. Phil. Is there a Creature yet so miserable That I can pity? End. Oh, my noble Lord, View my strange Fortune, and bestow on me Out of good Nature (if my Services Can merit nothing) so much as may help To keep this little piece I hold of Life From Cold and Hunger. Phil. Is it thou? Go sell, For shame, those misbecoming Cloaths thou wear'st, And feed thy self with them. End. Alas, my Lord, I can get nothing for them; People here Think it were Treason for them but to touch Such gay, fine things. Phil. Now, by my Life, this is Unkindly done to vex me with thy Sight; Thou'rt fallen back to thy dissembling Trade. How should'st thou think to cozen me again? Remains there yet a Plague untry'd for me? Ev'n so thou wept'st when first I took thee up; Wretch that I was to do so; if thy Tears Can work on any other, use thy Art, I'll not betray it. Which Way wilt thou take? That I may shun thee? for thy Eyes to mine Are Poison; and I'm loth to grow in Rage: Say, which way wilt thou take? End. Which way you please: Since I can't go with you, I have no Choice; But I'm resolv'd where'er I go to have That Path in chase which leads unto my Grave. [Exeunt severally. Enter Cleon, and the Woodmen. Cleon. This is the strangest sudden Change! You Woodmen. 1 Wood. My Lord Cleon. Cleon. Saw you a Lady come this Way on a sable Horse, and stubb'd with Stars of white? 2 Wood. Was she not young and tall? Cleon. Yes. Rode she to the Wood or the to Plain? 2 Wood. Faith, my Lord, we saw none. [Ex. Woodmen. Enter Agremont. Cleon. Pox o' your Questions then. What is she found? Agr. Nor will be, I think. Cleon. Let him seek his Daughter himself? she cannot stir about a little necessary Business, but the whole Court must be in Arms; when she has done, we shall have Peace. Agr. There's already a thousand fatherless Tales amongst us; some say her Horse run away from her; some a Wolf pursu'd her; others it was a Plot to kill her; and that arm'd Men were seen in the Wood; but questionless she rode away willingly. Enter King and Adelard. King. Where is she? Agr. Sir, I cannot tell. King. How's that? If thou dost answer so— Agr. Sir, shall I lie? King. Yes, and be damn'd, rather than tell me that; I say again, where is she? Mutter not; Sir, speak you where she is. Cleon. I do not know. King. Speak that again so boldly, and by Heav'n It is thy last; you, fellows, answer me; Where is she? Mark me all, I am your King; I wish to see my Daughter, shew me her, I do command you all, as you are Subjects, To shew her me: What am I not your King? And are you not t' obey what I command. Cleon. Yes; if the thing be possible and honest. King. Be possible and honest? Hear me, thou, Thou Traytor, that confin'st thy King to what Is possible and honest; shew her me. Cleon. Indeed I can't, till I know where she is. King. You have betray'd me; you have lost my Life, The Jewel of my Life; go, bring her me, And set her here before me; 'tis the King Will have it so; whose Breath can still the Winds, Uncloud the Sun, charm down the swelling Seas, And stop the Floods of Heav'n: Can't it? Speak. Cleon. No. King. No? Cannot the Breath of Kings do this? Cleon. No; nor smell sweet it self, if once the Lungs Be but corrupted. King. Is it so? Take heed. Cleon. Sir, take you heed you do not dare the Pow'rs That must be just. King. Alas, what are we Kings? Why do you, Gods, place us above the rest To be serv'd, flatter'd, and ador'd, till we Believe we hold within our Hands your Thunder; And when we come to try the Pow'r we have, There's not a single Leaf shakes at our Threatning? I've sinn'd, 'tis true, and here stand to be punish'd; Yet would not thus be punish'd: Let me chuse My Way, and lay it on. Cleon. He articles with Heav'n; would somebody would draw the Bonds for the Performance of Covenants betwixt them. Enter Thrasomond, Melesinda, and Alga. King. What, is she found? Thras. No; we have ta'en her Horse, He gallop'd empty by. King. You, Melesinda, rode with her into The Wood: Why left you her? Mel. She bid me do't. King. What if she did? You should not have obey'd. Mel. 'Twould ill become my Fortunes and my Birth To disobey the Daughter of my King. King. Y'are willing to obey us for our Hurt; But I will have her. Thras. If I have her not, There shall be no more Sicily by Heav'n. Cleon. Why, what will he carry it away in's Pocket? King. I see the Injuries I've done must be Reveng'd. Cleon. But this will never find her out. King. Run all; disperse your selves; whoe'er he be, That can but bring her to me shall be happy. Thras. Come, let us seek. Cleon. Each Man a several Way. [Exeunt. Enter a Country Fellow. Clown. I'll see the King if he be in the Forest; I have hunted him these two Hours; if I should go home, and not see him, my Sister would laugh at me. I can meet with nothing but People better hors'd than my self, that outride me; nor can I hear any thing but shouting: These Kings had need of good Brains? this whooping is able to put a mean Man out of his Wit. Well, I'll about it again. [Exit. Enter Araminta. Ara. Where am I now? Feet, find me out a Way, Without the Counsel of my troubled Head; I'll trust you boldly amidst all these Woods; O'er Mountains, thorough Brambles, Pits, and Floods. Heaven I hope will ease me: I am sick. Enter Endymion. End. Yonder's my honour'd Lady, fast asleep: I fear she faints; the lovely red is gone To guard her Heart: She breaths not. Madam, Open once more those rosie Twins, and send To my dear Lord your last Farewel. She stirs. How is it, Madam, pray? Ara. 'Tis not well done To put me in a miserable Life, And hold me there: I pray thee let me go; I shall do best without thee: I am well. Enter Philander. Phil. I was to blame to be so much in Rage; I'll tell her truly when and where I heard This killing Truth; I will be temperate In speaking, and as just in hearing too. Oh monstrous! Tempt me not, you Gods; good Gods, Tempt not a frail Man: What's he that has a Heart, But he must ease it here? End. Are you not better yet? Ara. I'm well forbear. Phil. Let me love Lightning, let me be embrac'd And kiss'd by Vipers rather than bear this. Despair dwell with you; what before my Face? Nature invent a Curse, and throw it on you: May Poison grow between your Lips, Diseases Be your Brood: I'll part you once at least. [Runs at Endymion, and hurts Araminta. Ara. Oh, dear Philander, leave to be inrag'd, And hear me. Phil. I have done; not the calm Sea, When Æolus locks up his windy Crew, Is less disturb'd than I: Thus you shall know it; Dear Araminta, do but take this Sword, And feel how temperate a Heart I have; Then you, and this your Boy, may live and reign In Lust, without controul. Wilt thou, Endymion? I prithee kill me: Thou art poor, and may'st Nourish ambitious Thoughts; were I but dead There would be nothing then to hinder thee. Am I mad now? Pray speak: I'm sure I were If after all the Wrongs I have receiv'd, I should desire to live: You will not kill Me then? End. Not for a World. Phil. I blame not thee, Endymion, thou hast done but that which Gods Would have transform'd themselves to do: Be gone; Leave me without Reply. This is the last [Exit End. Of all our Meetings; come then, kill me with This Sword; be wise, lest worse might follow; one Of us must die. Ara. Indeed I think I must; My Wound begins to make me faint already. Phil. How? What Wound? Where? Ara. O, touch me gently, there: I hope 'twill give me ease in t' other World, For I could never yet find any here. Phil. My cruel Stars, what have you brought upon me! Now I defy you all to do your worst. Ara. But tell me, pray, are there no Jealousies, No Slanders, where I'm going? No ill there? Phil. O, say no more, but help to stop thy Wound; It was not meant to thee, but to the Boy; That vile, ungrateful Boy. Ara. Would you not then have kill'd me? Pray say no, Whate'er you meant. Phil. Can I hear this, and live? Why would you make me mad? Force me to do I know not what, and hurt you? Why would you Disgrace me thus? Why did you love the Boy? (Curse on th' unhappy Hour when I was born!) How could you find i' your Heart to use me so? Ara. Alas, my Soul doats only upon you, And can love nothing else, whate'er you do. Enter Clown. Clown. Hey day! What have we here? Phil. Ha! What art thou? Clown. Gods uds, Courtier with his naked Sword upon a Woman! I think the Rogue has hurt her too; I'm sure she bleeds. By'r leave, fair Lady, who has hurt you so? Phil. Good honest Friend, pursue thy own Affairs. Clown. Friend me no Friends; I'll know who hurt the Woman. Phil. Nay leave us, Sirrah, or thou shalt repent it. Clown. Say'st thou so, Boy, I will try that i'faith. Phil. Slave, dost thou dare me thus? (They Fight.) Ara. Heav'ns guard my Lord. [Clown falls.] Phil. The Gods take part against me sure, this Boor [Noise within.] Could ne'er have hurt me else. Here's People coming. What shall I do? Alas, what shall I think? I heard her pray for me when I was fighting. Perhaps she may be injur'd. O my Fate! I either am dishonour'd, or a Wretch To be despis'd; the very worst of Men. [Noise again.] Ara. Fly, fly, my Lord, or your dear Life is lost. Phil. D' ye think I'll leave you thus to save my Life? Ara. Do it then pray, Philander, to save mine; For if you stay indeed I'll bleed to Death; It is not hard to do: And yet methinks My Wound is nothing now y' are sorry for't. As soon as you are safe I shall be well. Phil. But I must never hope to be so more. Kill me, and pardon me; 'tis all I beg. Farewel then; if thou'rt true, I'll kill my self; And tho' thou should'st deserve the worst of Thoughts, However, I forgive thee all thy Faults. [Exit. Enter Thrasomond, Cleon, Agremont, Adelard, and Woodmen. Thras. What art thou? Clown. Almost kill'd I am for a foolish Woman; a Knave has hurt her. Thras. The Princess, Gentlemen! where's the Wound, Madam? Is it dangerous? Ara. He has not hurt me. Clown. I say she lyes; he has hurt her in the Side: Look else. Thras. O sacred Spring of innocent Blood! Cleon. 'Tis above Wonder who should do this. Ara. I feel it not. Thras. Speak, Villain; who has hurt the Princess? Clown. Is it the Princess? Cleon. I. Clown. Then I have seen something yet. Thras. But who has hurt her? Clown. I told you a Rogue: I ne'er saw him before. Thras. Madam, who did it? Ara. Some dishonest Wretch: Alas I know him not, and do forgive him. Clown. He's hurt too, he cannot go far: I made my Father's old Fox fly about his Ears. Thras. How will you have me kill him? Ara. Not at all; 'tis some distracted Fellow. Thras. By this Hand I'll leave ne'er a piece of him bigger than a Nut, and bring him all in my Hat. Ara. Nay, good Sir, if you do take him, bring him to me Alive; and I'll invent some Punishment For him, great as his Fault. Thras. I will. Ara. But swear. Thras. Why then i'fecks I will. Wait you upon The Princess: Woodmen, lead of this poor Man. Come, Gentlemen, let us pursue our Chase. [Exeunt Thras. Cleon, Agr. Adel. [1 Wood. and Araminta. Clown. I pray you, Freind, let me see the King. 2 Wood. That you shall, and receive Thanks. Clown. If I get clear with this, I'll go no more to gay Sights in haste. [Exeunt. Enter Endymion. End. A Heaviness near Death sits on my Brow, And I must sleep; bear me, thou gentle Bank For ever if thou wilt; you sweet ones all, Let me unworthy press you; I could wish, I rather were a Coarse strew'd o'er with you Than quick above you: Dulness shuts my Eyes, And I am giddy: O, that I could take So sound a Sleep as I might never wake. Enter Philander. Phil. Whither shall I go now, or rather why Should I go any farther? True, I'll end My Journey here. What should I travel for With such an odious, tiresom Load upon me, As now, alas, my Life is grown? And which I must not hope to save whate'er falls out: For if she's false, I'm sure I cannot live; And if she should prove true, I'd scorn to do't, After the Injuries I've basely done her. Oh why should we thus madly be inclin'd To think the worse of those we love the most? Ye Gods, it is too great a Tyranny to plague Mankind at once with Love and Jealousie. Who's this? Endymion sleeping? 'Tis unjust Thy Sleep should be so sound, and mine, whom thou Hast wrong'd, so broken. I hope he will not wake; I'm very loth to kill him, but I feel Something within me that would force me to't: If I should but once more behold his Eyes, They are the Cause of all my Miseries. Yet she did vow to me she loves him not; But who is he dares trust to Women's Tongues? They are so us'd to talk before they think, They know not how to mean one Word they say. I'm sure I saw him take her in his Arms; And he deserves to lose his Life for that. [Endymion wakes.] End. I cannot sleep, my Heart's too full of Grief; No sooner are my Eye-lids clos'd, but straight Methinks I see Philander in a Rage, Ready to strike me dead. Sure there he stands: It must be he, for none was ever like him: I cannot bear his Hatred any longer; I'll speak, tho' he should kill me for't. Can you My Lord, be angry with me still? Phil. Forbear; If thou com'st near thou wilt compel me to An Act I would avoid. End. Pray hear me first. Phil. Begone. End. I can't. Phil. Then take what thou deserv'st. [Wounds him.] End. Blest be that Hand: Again, for Pity's Sake. Phil. My Legs now fail me quite with Loss of Blood; Take your Revenge; I'll teach you Cruelty: It was this luckless Hand that hurt the Princess. Tell my Pursuers, you receiv'd your Wound In staying me, and I will second it. [Noise without. End. Oh, fly, and save your self, my Lord. Phil. How's this? Would'st thou I should be safe? End. Else it were vain For me to live: The Wound you gave me has Not yet bled much; reach me that noble Hand, I'll help to cover you. Phil. Art thou then true? End. Or let me perish loath'd; Come, my good Lord, Creep in among these Bushes; who does know, But that the Gods may save your precious Life? Phil. Then shall I die for Grief, if not for this, That I have wounded thee; what wilt thou do? End. Shift well enough for one, I warrant you. Within. Follow, follow; that way they went. End. With my own Wound I'll bloody my own Sword, I need not counterfeit to fall; Heav'n knows, That I can stand no longer. Enter Thrasomond, Cleon, Agremont, and Adelard, Thras. I'm sure, To this Place we have track'd him by his Blood. Agr. Yonder creeps one away. Cleon. Stay, what are you? End. A wretched Creature, wounded in these Woods By Beasts; relieve me, if your Names be Men, Or I shall perish. Cleon. This is he, my Lord, Upon my Soul, that hurt her; 'tis the Boy That serv'd her. Thras. O thou damn'd in thy Creation, What Cause hadst thou to hurt the Princess? speak. End. Then I'm betray'd. Cleon. No, apprehended, Sir. End. Well, I confess the Fact, urge it no more. I set upon the Princess, and design'd Her Death: For Charity, let fall at once The Punishment you mean, and do not load This weary'd Flesh with Tortures. Thras. I will know Who hir'd thee to this. End. My own Revenge. Thras. Revenge! for what? End. It pleas'd her to receive Me for her Page, and when my Fortunes ebb'd, (As Rivers being unsupply'd grow dry) And Men strid o'er them carelesly; She pour'd Her welcome Graces on my Wants, and swell'd My Streams so high, that they o'erflow'd their Banks. Threatning Destruction to whoe'er durst cross 'em. But then as swift as Storms rise at Sea, She cast her fiery Eyes like Lightning on me, And in an instant blasted all my Hopes; And left me worse, and more contemn'd by far Than other little Brooks, because I had Been great: In short I knew I could not live, And therefore did desire to die reveng'd. Thras. I'll torture ye i'fecks. Agr. Come lead him hence. [Philander creeps out.] Phil. Turn back, you Ravishers of Innocence: Know you the Price of that you bear away So rudely? Adel. Who is this? Cleon. The Lord Philander. Phil. 'Tis not the Treasure of all Kings in one, The Wealth of Tagus, nor the Rocks of Pearl That pave the Court of Neptune, can weigh down This Virtue: It was I that hurt the Princess. Place me some God upon a Pyramis, Higher than Hills of Earth, and lend a Voice Loud as your Thunder to me; that from thence I may declare to all the under World The Worth that dwells in him. Thras. Who's this? End. My Lord, some Man that's weary of his Life. Phil. Leave these untimely Courtesies, Endymion. End. Alas, he's mad; come, will you lead me on? Phil. By all the Oaths that Men ought most to keep, And Gods do punish most when they are broken, He touch'd her not. Take heed, Endymion, How thou dost drown the Virtues thou hast shewn With Perjury: By all that's good, 'twas I; You know she stood betwixt me and my Right. Agr. It was Philander. Cleon. 'Tis a brave Boy. Adel. I fear, We were all deceiv'd. Phil. Have I no Friend here? Cleon. Yes. Phil. Pray shew it then, Somebody lend a Hand to draw me near him? Would you have Tears shed for you when you die? Then lay me gently on his Neck, that there I may weep Floods, and breath my Spirit out. 'Tis not the Wealth of Plutus, nor the Gold Lock'd in the Heart of Earth, can buy away This armful from me: You hard-hearted Men, More stony than these Mountains, can you see Such pure Blood drop, and not cut off your Flesh To stop it with? Queens ought to tear their Hair To bind these Wounds, and bathe them with their Tears. If I had Strength, I'd pluck my Heart out. Oh, Endymion! Thou that art the Wealth of poor Philander, and that I have us'd so ill; Pray let my Crimes be punish'd as they ought, And don't forgive me, I deserve it not. Enter King, &amp;c. King. What is the Villain ta'en? Thras. Both these confess the Deed. Phil. Sir, question it no more, 'twas I. King. The Fellow that did fight with him will tell. Ara. Ay me! I know he will. King. You know him sure. Ara. No, Sir; if it was he, he was disguis'd. Phil. I was so. Oh why am I not yet dead? King. Thou vain, ambitious Fool; thou that hast laid A Train for thy own Life; now I do mean To do; I'll leave to talk: Bear him to Prison. Ara. Sir, they did plot together to take hence This harmless Life; should it pass unreveng'd, I should to Earth go weeping; grant me then (By all the Love a Father bears his Child) Their Custody, and that I may appoint Their Tortures, and the Way they are to die. King. 'Tis granted; take 'em to you with a Guard. Come, Princely Thrasomond, this Business past, We may with more Security go on To our intended Match. [Exeunt all but Cleon and Agremont. Agr. This Action of Philander, I'm afraid, Will lose the People's Hearts. Cleon. No; fear it not: Their Subtilty will think it but a Trick. Enter Adelard. Agr. How are his Wounds? Adel. They are but Scratches; it Was only Loss of Blood that made him faint. Cleon. Come, let's go see him. Adel. No, not yet; The King Has told the Princess he'll be with her straight, And that he will examine there Philander, About this Plot; and his Confederates. Cleon. Sure if he had a Plot, he'd tell us on't. But what a Devil made him hurt the Princess, I can't imagine what all this should mean. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. Scene I. Philander, Araminta, Endymion. Ara. Nay, dear Philander, pray lament no more End. For Heavens sake give o'er; we're very well. Phil. Oh Araminta, oh Endymion, leave To be thus kind; I shall be shut from Heav'n, As now from Earth, if you continue so. I am a Man that have abus'd a pair Of the most trusty ones Earth ever bore: Can it still bear us all? Forget me, pray, Think that so great a Wretch could not be born, As was Philander. And for thee, my Boy, I shall declare Words that will mollifie The Hearts of Beasts, to spare thy Innocence. End. Alas, my Lord, my Life is not a Thing Worthy your noble Thoughts: 'Tis not a Life, 'Tis but a Piece of Childhood thrown away. Should I outlive you, I should then outlive Virtue and Honour; And when that Day comes, If ever above once I close these Eyes, May I live spotted for my Perjury. Ara. And I the miserablest Maid alive, Do, by the Honour of a Virgin, vow Never to quit you. Phil. Make me not so hated: People will tear me, when they find you true To such a Wretch as me: I shall die loath'd. Enjoy your Kingdoms peaceably, whilst I For ever sleep forgotten with my Faults. Every just Servant, every Maid in Love Will have a Piece of me, if you be true. End. A piece of you? He must be one not born Of Woman, that can cut it, and look on. Phil. Take me in Tears betwixt you; for my Heart Will break with Shame and Sorrow. Ara. Grieve no more. Phil. Pray tell me now, if you had wrong'd me basely, And found your Life no Price compar'd to mine? What Is't you would have done? End. 'Twas a Mistake. Phil. What if it were? End. We would have ask'd your pardon. Phil. And hope t' enjoy it too? Ara. Enjoy it? Yes. Phil. Would you indeed? Be plain. End. We would, my Lord. Phil. Forgive me then. Ara. So, so, 'tis well. Are all things ready for our Marriage? End. I'll go see; Learn all to love without Design from me. [Exit. Phil. Lead to my Death. Ara. I hope not so; at least Thus much I'm sure of, that I won't outlive you: And that I might the better claim a Right To end my Days with yours, I have a Priest Ready to join our Hands and Hearts together. Phil. Can there be yet a new Invention found Still more to shame Philander? I must now Fly from her Love, or be her Murderer. Ara. What means this Pause? Why won't you speak to me? Phil. I know not which is worst; O my dear Soul, I dare not trust your Father's Cruelty; He is grown hot and speedy in his Rage. And now I'm Master of my self again, It is not in my Power to do you harm. Ara. Nothing can harm me but your want of Love, I dread your Coldness, not his Heat nor Rage. Phil. Ay, but his Hatred against me is such, He would destroy you too if you were mine. Ara. What if he did; I should take Pleasure in't, Had I but you, Philander, in my Arms. Phil. Dear Araminta, press me not so far; Try not my Passion with too strong a Test; Lovers can never very long be wise; They go too fast to keep a steddy Pace, And mind with too much Violence present things To take their Measures right of what's to come: If you inflame me more, my Love will grow So wild, I shall not have one cool Thought left, And then I shall undo thee. Ara. No, you'll make Me blest; of all the Race of Womankind Most happy. Phil. But yet I— Ara. What? Phil. I'm afraid. Ara. Do not torment me thus, if 'tis for Love Of me you are so; mark what I shall say; For Heav'n ne'er yet declar'd a greater Truth; Marry me straight, before my Father comes, (And you forget how soon he will be here,) Or, by your Life, which I prize more than mine, I'll kill my self. Phil. Nay, then I must obey: And pardon me, my dearest Araminta, If I, at such a Time of Joy as this, Can yet have Griefs about me; but I have, To find that I'm outdone, tho' by thy self, So far in all the kindest Proofs of Love. Ara. Ah, could my Death to the whole World proclaim, How I love more than you; my Pride would be So great in having it divulg'd that I Should scarce (I am afraid) accept of Life, Tho' to enjoy you still. Phil. Come then, my dear, Let's talk no more, but love, love till we die. Ara. Let's kill our selves with loving furiously, And so prevent my Father's future Crimes. [Exeunt. Enter Cleon, Agremont, Adelard. Cleon. But are you sure the King has sent for him? Adel. Yes; to the Scaffold; but the King must know, It is in vain for Kings to war with Heav'n. Cleon. You told us tho' the King would hear this Fact Examin'd in the Chamber of the Princess. Adel. He meant so once, now he has chang'd his Mind. Cleon. Come then, we'll scuffle hard before he perish. Enter King and a Guard. King. Gentlemen, who saw Prince Thrasomond? Agr. He's gone and please your Majesty, to view the City, and the new Platform, with some Gentlemen attending on him. King. Is the Princess ready to bring her Prisoners out? Adel. I'll go see. King. Tell her, we stay. Cleon. King, you may be deceiv'd yet; The Head you aim at cost more setting on Than to be lost so slightly. Enter Messenger. Mess. Where's the King? King. Here. Mess. Haste, Sir, to your Strength, and save your self, The City's in a Mutiny, fearing for Lord Philander. King. Bid 'em go hang themselves. Cleon. O, brave Countrymen! Mutiny, my fine dear Countrymen, Mutiny! Now my brave valiant Foremen, shew your Weapons, In Honour of your Mistresses. Enter Philander, Araminta, and Endymion. King. How comes Philander thus to be unbound? End. He is as fast as Wedlock, Sir, can bind him. King. What means this Riddle? Ara. He's my Husband, Sir. King. Your Husband, say you? Call the Captain in, That guards the Citadel; there you shall have Your Nuptial Joys together: Hear, you Gods, From this Time do I shake all Title off Of Father to this Woman, this base Woman; And what there is of Vengeance in a Lion Cast among Dogs, or robb'd of his dear young; The same inforc'd more terrible, and with A greater Rage, expect from me. Ara. Sir, by That little Life I've left to swear by, there Is nothing that can stir me from my self: What I have done, I never shall repent of, For Death can be no Bug-bear now to me, Since Thrasomond is not to be my Headsman. Cleon. Sweet Peace upon thy Soul, thou worthy Woman, Whene'er thou dy'st; for this Time I'll excuse thee, Or be thy Prologue. Phil. Sir, let me speak next; And let my dying Words persuade you more Than my dull Life has done: If you design, Or wish a Wrong to her sweet Innocence, You are a Tyrant, and a Savage one; The Memory of all your better Deeds Shall be in Water writ, but this in Marble: No Chronicle shall speak you, tho' your own, But for the Shame of Men; No Monument (Tho' high and big as Pelion) shall be able To cover this base Murther: Make it rich With Brass, with purest Gold, and shining Jasper, Like Pyramids, and lay on Epitaphs, Such as make great Men Gods; my little Marble (That only cloaths my Ashes, not my Faults) Shall far outshine it: And for After-issues, Think not so madly of the heav'nly Wisdoms, That they will give you more for your mad Rage To cut off thus, unless it be some Snake, Or something like your self, that in his Birth Shall strangle you: Think of my Father, King, There was a Fault; but I forgive it; let That Sin persuade you to be careful of Your matchless Daughter; spare but her dear Life, And I'll surrender you my own with Joy; Tho' I confess I now could with to live, For I in her have all this Word can give To make me happy. Enter another Messenger. Mess. Arm, Sir, quickly, or 'Twill be too late; the City's up in Arms, Led by an old gray Ruffian that has seiz'd Upon Prince Thrasomond, and swears he'll kill Him, if Philander be not straight releas'd. King. A thousand Devils take 'em. Cleon. A thousand Blessings on 'em, and on all Will take their Parts; I'm sure that I'll make one. King. Come, to the Citadel; I'll see these safe, [Ex. with Philander and Araminta.] And then cope with these Burghers. Let the Guard, And all the Gentlemen, give strong Attendance. [Exit. Manent Cleon, Agremont, Adelard. Agr. The City up! this was above our Wishes. Cleon. I, and the Marriage too; now by my Life This noble Lady has deceiv'd us all: A Plague upon my self, a thousand Plagues, For having such unworthy Thoughts of her Dear Honour. Oh, how I could beat my self? Preethee beat me, and I'll beat thee again, For we had both one Thought. Agr. No, 'twill lose time. Cleon. Are your Swords sharp? Well my dear Countrymen, what d'ye lack? if you continue and fall not back upon the first broken Shin, I'll have you chronicled and chronicled, and cut and chronicled, and all to be prais'd, and sung in Sonnets and new Ballads, that all Tongues shall troul you in Sæcula Sæculorum, my kind Can-carriers. Adel. What if a Toy take 'em in th' Heels now, and they run all away, and cry the Devil take the hindmost? Cleon. Then the same Devil take the foremost too, and souce him for his Breakfast; if they all prove Cowards, my Curses fly amongst them, and be speeding. May they have Murrains reign, to keep the Gentlemen at home unbound in easie Freeze: May the Moths branch their Velvets, and their Silks only be worn before sore Eyes. May their false Lights undo 'em, and discover Presses, Holes, Stains and Oldness in their Stuffs, and make 'em Shop-rid. May they keep Whores and Horses, and break; and live mew'd up with Necks of Beef and Turneps. May they have many Children, and all ugly like the Fathers. May they know no Language, but that Gibberish they prattle to their Parcels, unless it be the Gothick Latin they write in their Bonds, and may they write that false, and lose their Debts. Enter King. King. A Vengeance take 'em, what a Hum they make! They swarm like Bees, and (like 'em) buz together: They have no Sense of any thing but Noise, And therefore will not hear, but bawl still all At once. Cleon. Oh my brave Countrymen! as I live I will not buy a Pin from out your Walls for this; nay you shall cozen me too, and I'll thank you for't. King. There is no stopping them, they're grown so strong, Except they see Philander; one kind Look Of his would send them home as tame as Sheep: To me they're fierce as Lions, and they've Reason. Why should I hope for Help in my Distress, That ne'er could pity any one alive? We think our selves so far above Mankind, That 'tis beneath us to be just or grateful. Alas, my Faults are numberless. Cleon. Yes, and Your Virtues are so too; for you have none: King. I see I must release him now: It goes Against my Heart to do a virtuous Act; But there's no Remedy. Who's there? Go bring Philander hither. Cleon. What can all this mean? [Exit Adelard. King. Ah, if we Princes did consider well, We are but Men as frail as others are, As subject to Misfortunes, and as mortal; That if the Powers above have made us great, 'Tis that we should with Justice rule their People; That Nations were not born to make us Sport, But we to make them glorious, safe, and happy; All our Concerns the Gods would favour more, And Men would all such Kings like Gods adore. Enter Agremont and Philander. O, worthy Sir, forgive me; do not make Both my Offences, and your Wrongs combine To bring on greater Dangers; be your self, Still sound amongst Diseases; If I've done You Injury, I'll make you now amends; Calm but the People, and my Daughter's yours; Take her, and with her my Repentance, Sir, My Wishes, and my Prayers: You shall be, What you were born to be, King of this Land. Do not mistrust me; if the least untruth Falls from me now, may I be struck with Thunder. Phil. I will not do your Majesty the Wrong To doubt your Word; let but the Princess, and The Boy be free, and I will stand alone The Shock of all this Rabble; which I'll quell, Or perish in th' Attempt. King. Your Word already Has done that: Go, fetch 'em hither straight. Phil. Then thus I take my Leave, kissing your Hand, And trusting to your Royal Promise, Sir, Be not disturb'd: I'll bring you back the Peace You wish for. King. All the Gods attend upon you. [Exeunt. Enter an old Captain and Citizens with Thrasomond. Cap. Come, my brave Myrmidons, let's fall on, let our Caps Swarm, my Boys, and your nimble Tongues forget your Mother Gibberish of What do you lack, and set your Mouths Up, Children, till your Palates fall frighted half a Fathom past the Cure of Bay Salt and gross Pepper, And then cry Philander, brave Philander, Let Philander be deeper in request, my Ding-dongs, My pair of dear Indentures, King of Clubs, Than your cold Water Chamlets, or your Paintings Spitted with Copper; let not your hasty Silks, Or your branch'd Cloth of Bodkin, or your Tissues, Dearly belov'd of Spice Cake and Custard, Your Robin Hoods and Johns, tie your Affections In Darkness to your Shops; no, dainty Duckers, Up with your three-pil'd Spirits, your wrought Valours, And let your uncouth Choler make the King feel The Measure of your Mightiness. Philander, Cry, my Rose-Nobles, cry. All. Philander, Philander. Cap. How do you like this, my Lord Prince? These are mad Boys, I tell you these are things that will not strike their Topsails To a Foist, and let a Man of War, an Argosie, hull and cry Cockles. Thras. Why, you rude Slaves, do you know what you do? Cap. My pretty Prince of Puppets, we do know, And give your Greatness warning that you talk No more such Bugs Words, or that solder'd Crown Shall be scratch'd with a Musquet: Dear Prince Pepin, Down with with your noble Blood, or as I live I'll have you coddled. Let him loose, my Spirits; Make a round ring with your Bills, my Hectors, And let us see what this trim Man dares do. Now, Sir, have at you; here I hit you, And with this swashing Blow, (do you sweat Prince?) I could hulk your Grace, and hang you up cross-legg'd, Like a Hare at the Poulterer's, and do this with this Wiper. Thras. You will not see me murder'd, wicked Villains? 1 Cit. Yes indeed will we, Sir, we have not seen one so this great while. Capt. He would have Weapons, would he? Give him a Broadside, my brave Boys, with your Pikes; branch me his Skin in Flowers like a Satin, and between every Flower a Mortal Cut; your Royalty shall ravel; jagg him Gentlemen. I'll have him cut to the Kell, and down the Seams. Oh for a Whip to make him Galoon Laces: I'll have a Coach Whip. Thras. O, spare me, Gentlemen. Cap. Hold, hold; the Man begins to fear, and know himself, He shall, for this time, only be seal'd up With a Feather thro' his Nose, that he may only see Heav'n, and think whither he's a going; Nay (beyond Sea, Sir,) we will proclaim you, you would be King? Thou tender Heir apparent to Church Ale, Thou slight Prince of single Sarcenet; Thou Royal Ring-tail, fit to fly at nothing But poor Men's Poultry, and have every Boy Beat thee from that too with his Bread and Butter. Thras. Gods keep me from these Hell-Hounds. 2 Cit. Shall's geld him, Captain? Capt. No, you shall spare his Dowcets, my dear Donsels, As you respect the Ladies, let them flourish: The Curses of a longing Woman kills as speedily as a Plague, Boys. 1 Cit. I'll have a Leg, that's certain. 2 Cit. I'll have an Arm. 3 Cit. I'll have his Nose, and at my own Charge build a College, and clap't upon the Gate. 4 Cit. I'll have his little Gut to string a Kit with; For certainly a Royal Gut will sound like Silver. 5 Cit. Good Captain, let me have his Liver to feed Ferrets. Cap. Who will have Parcels else? Speak. Thras. Good Gods, consider me; I shall be tortur'd. 1 Cit. Captain, I'll give you the trimming of your Hand-Sword, and let me have his Skin to make false Scabbards. 2 Cit. He had no Horns, Sir, had he? Cap. No, Sir, he's a Pollard. What would'st thou do with Horns? 2 Cit. Oh! if he had, I would have made rare Hafts and Whistles of them, but his Shin Bones, if they be sound, will serve me well enough. Enter Philander. All. Long live Philander! the brave Prince Philander. Phil. I thank you, Gentlemen, but why are these Rude Weapons brought abroad to teach your Hands Uncivil Trades? Cap. My Royal Rosicleer, We are thy Myrmidons, thy Guards, thy Roarers; And when this noble Body is in durance, Thus do we clap our musty Murriay on, And trace the Streets in terror. Is it Peace, Thou Mars of Men? Is the King sociable, And bids thee live? Art thou above thy Foe, Man? And free as Phæbus? Speak; if not, this Stand Of Royal Blood shall be a broach, a tilt, and run Ev'n to the Lees of Honour. Phil. Hold, and be satisfy'd, I am my self, Free as my Thoughts are, by the Gods I am. Cap. Art thou the dainty Darling of the King? Art thou the Hylas to our Hercules? Do the Lords bow, and the regarded Scarlets, Kiss their gam'd Goles, and cry we are your Servants? Is the Court navigable, and the Presence stuck With Flags of Friendship? If not we are thy Castle, And this Man sleeps. Phil. I am what I desire to be, your Friend, I am what I was born to be, your Prince. And what, Sir, say you now? Thras. For God's Sake set me first free, and I'll say any thing; I am so afraid I know not what to say. Phil. I do pity thee. Friends, discharge your Fears, Deliver me the Prince. I'll warrant you, I shall be old enough to find my Safety. Cap. Prince, by your leave, I'll have a Surfiagle, And make you like a Hawk. Phil. Away, away, there is no Danger in him: Look you, Friends, how gently he leads; upon my Word He's tame enough, he needs no farther watching: Good Friends, go to your Houses, and by me have your Pardons and my Love. And know there shall be nothing in my Pow'r You may deserve, but you shall have your Wishes. To give you more Thanks were to flatter you: Continue still your Love, and for an earnest, Die with this. All. Long may'st thou live brave Prince, brave Prince, brave Prince. [Ex. Philander and Thrasomond. Cap. Thou art the King of Courtesy. Fall off again, my sweet Youths, and every Man trace to his House again, and hang his Pewter up, thence to the Tavern, and bring your Wives in Muffs; we will have Musick, and red Grape shall make us dance and reel, Boys. [Ex. omnes. Enter King, Araminta, Melesinda, Alga, Cleon, Agremont, Adelard, Endymion, and Attendants. King. Is it appeas'd? Cleon. Sir, all is quiet as this Dead of Night, As peaceable as Sleep. The Lord Philander Does bring Prince Thrasomond away himself. King. I will not break a Word that I have giv'n In promise to him: I have heap'd a World Of Grief upon his Head, which yet I hope To wash away. Enter Philander and Thrasomond. Cleon. My Lord is come. King. My Son, Blest be the Time that I of Right to call Such Virtue mine. Now thou art in my Arms, Methinks I find a Salve to my sick Bosom For all the Wounds I find there; Streams of Grief I have thrown on thee, but I find much Joy, That I repent it, issue from my Eyes. Let them appease thee, take thy Right, take her, She is thy Right too, and forget to urge My vexed Soul for what I once have done. Phil. Sir, all is blotted from my Memory: For you, young Prince of Spain, Whom I have thus redeem'd, you have full Leave To make your honourable Voyage home. And if you would go furnish'd to your Realm With fair Diversion, I do see a Lady Methinks would gladly bear you Company. How like you, Sir, this Piece? Alga. Sir, he likes it well, For he has try'd it, and found it worth His Princely Liking. We were ta'en a bed, I know your Meaning. I am not the first That Nature taught to seek a handsom Fellow. Can Shame remain perpetually in me. And not in others? Or have Princes Salves To cure ill Names, that meaner People want? Phil. What mean you? Alga. You must get another Ship To bear the Princess, and the Boy together. Cleon. How now? Alga. Others took me, but I took her and him, As that all Women may be ta'en sometimes, Ship us all four; we can endure Weather and Wind alike. King. Clear then thy self, or call me not thy Father. Ara. 'Tis false as Heav'n is true, but what Means Is left to clear my self? It lies in your Belief. My Lords, believe me, and let all things else Struggle together to dishonour me. End. O! stop your Ears, great King, that I may speak As Freedom would, then I will call this Lady As base as are her Actions: Hear me, Sir, Believe your heated Blood when it rebels Against your Reason, sooner than this Lady. Alga. I vow the Boy acts his Part full well. Phil. This Lady; I will sooner trust the Winds or Seas Than her. I say, believe her not. Why think you if I did believe her Words, I would outlive 'em! King. Forget her; since, all is firm between us; But I must request of you one Favour, And will not be deny'd. Phil. By all the Powers let it not be the Death Of her or him, and it is surely granted. King. Bear away that Boy To Torture, I will have her clear'd or bury'd. Phil. O give my Promise back, O Royal Sir, Ask something else, bury my Life and Right In one poor Grave; but take not from me My Life and Fame at once. King. Away with him; his Doom's irrevocable. Phil. Turn all your Eyes on me, here stands a Man, The falsest and the basest of the World. Set Swords against this Breast, some honest Man, For I have liv'd to be the most accurs'd. End. Be patient, Sir, I soon will make you easy. I cannot tamely see your Pain for me; My hapless Fortune much rather I'll reveal. King. Will he then confess? Cleon. He seems to say so. King. Speak then. End. Great King, if you command This Lord to talk with me alone my Tongue, Urg'd by my Heart, shall utter all the Thoughts My Youth has known, and stranger things than these You hear not often. King. Walk aside with him. Cleon. Why speak'st thou not? End. Know you this Face, my Lord? Cleon. No. End. I have been often told In Court of an Euphrosyne, a Lady, And Daughter to you, between whom and me There was such strange Resemblance, that we Two Could not be known asunder, drest alike. Cleon. By Heav'n, and so there is. End. For her Sake, Who now does spend the Spring Time of her Life In holy Pilgrimage, move the King, That I may scape this Torture. Cleon. But thou speak'st as like Euphrosyne as thou dost look. How came it to thy Knowlege that she lives In Pilgrimage; End. I know it not, my Lord, but have heard it, And do scarce believe it. Cleon. Oh my Shame! is't possible? Draw near, That I may gaze upon thee? Art thou she, Or else her Murderer? Where wast thou born? End. In Syracuse. Cleon. What's thy Name? End. Euphrosyne. Cleon. 'Tis she! Now I do know thee: Oh! that thou hadst dy'd, And I had never seen thee, nor my Shame! How shall I own thee? Shall this Tongue of mine E'er call thee Daughter more? End. Would I had dy'd indeed; I wish it too, E'er publish'd what I have told; But that there was no Means To hide it longer: Yet I joy in this, The Princess is all clear. King. What have you done? Cleon. All is discover'd. Ara. What is discover'd? Cleon. Why, my Shame. It is a Woman, let her speak the rest. Phil. How! that again. Cleon. It is a Woman. [Exit. Phil. Blest be the Pow'rs that favour Innocence. King. Lay hold upon that Lady. Phil. It is a Woman; hark ye, Gentlemen, It is a Woman! Araminta, take My Soul into thy Breast, that could be gone With Joy! It is a Woman; thou art fair, And virtuous still to Ages, in despight of Malice. King. Speak you, where lies his Shame? End. I am his Daughter. Phil. The Gods are just. Cleon. I dare accuse none; but before you two The Virtue of the Age, I bend my Knee For Mercy. Phil. Take it freely; for I know It was well meant. Ara. And for me, I have the Will to pardon Sins as oft As any Man has Power to wrong me. Cleon. Noble and worthy! Phil. But, Endymion, (For I must call thee still so) tell me why Thou didst conceal thy Sex? It was a Fault, A Fault, Endymion, tho' thy other Deeds Of Truth outweigh'd it. All these Jealousies Had flown to nothing, if thou hadst discover'd What now we know. End. My Father oft would speak Your Worth and Virtue with a zealous Praise, Which as I grew in Age encreas'd a Thirst Of seeing of a Man so rais'd above the rest. But this was but the Child of Curiosity, Till Fate one Day brought you to my Father's, And I was order'd there to entertain you. Oh spare my Blushes; and yet a Flame so pure Methinks should cause no Shame. The only Bliss that ever I propos'd, Was still to live and be within your Sight. For this I did delude my noble Father With a feign Pilgrimage, and drest my self In a Boys Habit, and understanding well, That when I made Discovery of my Sex I could not stay with you. I made a Vow By all the most religious things a Maid Could call together, never to be known, Whilst there was Hopes to hide me from Mens Eyes For other than I seem'd, that I might ever Abide with you. Then sate I by the Fountain, Where first you took me up. King. Search out a Match, Greatest in our Kingdoms, and I will Pay thy Dower my self. End. Ne'er, Sir, will I Marry, it is a thing within my Vow: But if I may have leave to serve the Princess, To see the Virtues of her Lord and her, I shall have Hopes to live. Ara. Yes, Philander, I can't be jealous, tho' you had a Lady Drest like a Page to serve you; nor will I Suspect her living here. Come live with me, Live free as I do; she that loves my Lord, Curst be the Wife that hates her. Phil. I grieve such Virtue should be laid in Earth Without an Heir. Hear me, my Royal Father, Wrong not the Freedom of our Soul so much To think to take Revenge on this base Woman: Her Malice cannot hurt us; set her free As she was born, saving from Shame and Sin. King. Set her at Liberty: But leave the Court: This is no Place for such. You, Thrasomond, Shall have free Passage, and safe Conduct home, Worthy so great a Prince. When you come there, Remember 'twas your Fault that cost you her, And not my purpos'd Will. Thras. I do confess it, most renowned Sir. King. Last join your Hands in one; enjoy Philander, This Kingdom that is yours, and after me Whatever I call mine; my Blessing on you: All happy Hours be at your Marriage Joys, That you may govern all these happy Lands, And live to see your plenteous Branches spring. By what has past this Day, let Princes learn To rule the wilder Passions of their Blood, For what Heav'n wills can never be withstood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE, To be Spoken by the Governour. By the Duke of Buckingham. If by my deep Contrivance, Wit and Skill Things fall out cross to what I mean them still, You must not wonder; 'tis the common Fate Of almost all grave Governours of late: And one would swear, as every Plot has sped, They thought more with their Elbows than their Head; Yet they go on as brisk, and look as well, As if they had out wisdom'd Machiavel: So Curs will wagg their Tails, and think they've won us, At the same instant they make water on us. Is't not to see Men should have none, That have such tedious, fulsom Bungling shown; For to go Five Years wrong with Art and Pains, Does shew a most prodigious want of Brains; Nay, tho' he ne'er judg'd right, yet there was one Who bragadocied still himself upon Being infallible, but he is gone. O! 'twas a Thought of vast Design and Scope, To rail still against Popery and Hope, He might presume to be himself a Pope: Tho' he might any thing presume to be That could deceive Fops so infallibly; The most egregious of all Scribes could tell There never was such an Achitophel: And true Admirers of his Parts and Glory, Will doubtless have a just Renown in Story. Ten Guineas that Lord paid for't, as Fame goes, Above ten times its worth the World knows; But he'll be better paid yet, I suppose. They were a matchless pair, the one to plot, The other to extol still what was not. Yet faith the little Lord, when hence he ran, Did compass one thing like an able Man: For since he could not living act with Reason, 'Twas shrewdly done of him to die in Season.</field>
