      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. MEN. Robin Hood, Mr. Beard. Will Scarlet, his Follower, Mr. Bulbrick. Little John, his Follower, Mr. Messing. Graspall, Father of Clarinda, Mr. Reinhold. Leander, in Love with Clarinda, Master Mattocks. Glitter, a young Fop, fond of Clarinda, Mr. Wilder. WOMEN. Clarinda, Graspall's Daughter, Miss Norris. Primrose, her Maid, Mrs. Clive. SCENE, SHERWOOD-FOREST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Forest of Sherwood. Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John, discover'd shooting in the Forest. Robin Hood. AIR. As blithe as the Linnet sings in the green Wood, So blithe we'll wake the Morn; And thro' the wide Forest of merry Sherwood We'll wind the Bugle Horn. The Sheriff attempts to take bold Robin Hood, Bold Robin disdains to fly: Come on when he will, in merry Sherwood We'll vanquish, Boys, or die. Our Arrows shall drink of the fallow Deer's Blood, We'll hunt them all over the Plain; And thro' the fair Forest of merry Sherwood, No Shaft shall fly in vain. Brave Scarlet and John, who were never subdu'd, Give each his Hand so to bold; We'll reign through the Forest of merry Sherwood: What say my Hearts of Gold? John. My noble Master, we your Words obey, And just as you command, will fight or play. Scarlet. Bold Robin Hood, permit me to demand, What Boy was that who on your fallow Land With you was talking? deep he seem'd in Woe, Nor wore he Forest Green, nor held a Bow. R. Hood. He loves Clarinda, and the beauteous Maid Has with her Heart his honest Suit repaid: She pines in vain, for, lost to gen'rous Views, Her cruel Father does her Choice refuse: But to relieve the Youth I'll risk my Blood, Merit was ne'er o'erlook'd by Robin Hoodâ But see how heavily Leander looksâ SCENE II. Enter Leander. Leander. AIR. To the Pines on the Mountains I murmur her Name; To the Grottos and Fountains I witness my Flame: Clarinda I sigh, Clarinda I cry, The Echoes, to mock me, Clarinda reply. R. Hood. Take courage, Youth, I've sworn to be your Friend, And will, tho' Death oppose, your Cause defend. Disguis'd, this Day to Nottingham I'll go, There Graspall seek, no more you yet must know. Farewel, I haste to do the generous Deed, And Fortune whispers that I shall succeed. First AIR repeated. Assisted by Love, and by bold Robin Hood, Take heart, and ne'er despair, For Robin will soon to the merry Sherwood Bring home your lovely Fairâ [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Chamber in Graspall's House. Enter Graspall, Clarinda, and Primrose. Graspall. I tell you, Child, you must young Glitter wed, He's rich and worthy to ascend your Bed. AIR. Consider, dear Daughter, what 'tis to be rich, Nor spurn thus unwise at the Blessing; The Views of being wealthy most Women bewitch, Such Husbands are sure worth possessing. You tell me he's silly, I say he has Pence; His Acres are boundless, his Treasures immense; A Coach and six Horses is Beauty and Sense; Then, pr'ythee, no longer refuse him. Clarinda. Alas! what adverse Stars my Fortune rule! Primrose. What! will you wed your Daughter to a Fool? Graspall. A Fool! pert Minx! suppose him one, what then? Are there not others so 'mongst marry'd Men? But see the Youth: Cheer up that frowning Face, As at the Toilette regulate each Grace. SCENE IV. Enter Glitter. Glitter. O Nymph! far brighter than the noon-day Sun; O Nymph! more fair than Rills that dimpling run; Match'd with those Eyes, how white appears the Sloe To that soft Skin, how black descending Snow! AIR. Op'ning Bud of matchless Beauty, Blossom of the Month of May; Adoration is my Duty, At thy Shrine my Vows I pay. Coursing o'er each rival Feature, Little wanton Cupids sport; Venus, to so bright a Creature, Would un-envying pay her Court. Graspall. A pretty Youth! and, take the Country round, I think so good a Party can't be found. Glitter. We English are too like our native Main, Boist'rous and loud, unsettled, fierce, and vain: But I have polish'd each rough Part away, And shine alike, all brillant and all gay: Yet let me own the Gratitude I owe, Paris and Rome have taught me what I know. Primrose aside. Of all the Wretches Fate could hither bring, Your travell'd Coxcomb is the vilest thing. Glitter. I'll sing a Song I on Clarinda made; The Thought is pretty, that must needs be said. AIR. My Heart's like an Anvil, the Hammer is Love, And 'gainst my poor Breast it so knocksâ The Blows are so hard, that I'm sure I cou'd prove, Less Force wou'd demolish an Ox. The Godlin on me has exhausted his Quiver, I feel the sharp Arrow pierce thorough my Liver: None but you, pretty Maid, such a Conquest e'er boasted; Take pity, or else I must die over-rosted. Primrose. Ah, would my Person could your Soul subdue, I'm surely form'd to suit a Youth like you. AIR. Whene'er you talk, methinks I hear The sweet-tongu'd Parrot sputter: You move with all that Grace and Air, That Crows do in a Gutter. The Maid that views that lovely Face, Resigns her Heart soon after; And at your Wit and charming Mien Expires in Fits of Laughter. Graspall. Primrose, that Tongue of thine will be thy bane; Or hold thy Peace, or else behold this Cane. Primrose. I've done, I've done. Glitter. I take my leave a while, ah Nymph divine! When torn from thee, bright Sun forget to shine. [Exit. SCENE V. Graspall. Now Daughter, tell me, do you like the Squire? Speak from your Heart, I the plain Truth require. Clarinda. To speak plain Truth, without the least Disguise; Of all the Wretches, him I most despise. Graspall. Well, I agree you ne'er shall Glitter wed; But let me name the Partner of your Bed. A certain wealthy Knight from London came, For even London hears your Beauty's Fame: Will you to take this Choice of mine agree? Leander is no Husband, Child, for me. Servant, within. Sir Humphrey Wealthy waits, Sir, at your Gate. Graspall. The very Man: Admit Sir Humphrey straight. Here, here's the Man shall make you truly bless'd. SCENE VI. Enter Robin Hood, disguis'd. Graspall. With Raptures, Sir, I hail so great a Guest. R. Hood. Your Raptures, Sir, are well receiv'd; but here Permit me this fair Goddess to revere. Say, beauteous Nymph! will you my Suff'rings ease? Or must I yield to Death by slow degrees? Graspall. Now, dear Clarinda, chear your Father's Heart, Give him your full Consent, and then depart. Clarinda. No, Sir, my Heart's no longer mine to give, With none but dear Leander will I live. AIR. The Ship is thus by Tempests toss'd Upon the raging Main; And now the Pilot thinks he's lost, And now he hopes again: Thus my divided Bosom fares, By turns exults, by turns despairs. [Exit. SCENE VII. Robin Hood, aside. Brave Girl! I long to change this vile Disguise, And bring her raptur'd Lover to her Eyes. Primrose. My Mistress gone, she order'd me to say, She thinks your Locks, good Sir, are much too gray; And she believes, if you some Weeks should tarry, You'll very likely die before you marry. AIR. Dear Sir, be advis'd by a Friend, Nor take a young Wife to your Bed; If still you persist in your Choice, Sir Knight, have a care of your Head. Brisk Youth may at all times attempt, Tho' oft they repent being wed; Their Hearts but too often do ake, With you, 'twill be Pain in your Head. A Knight shou'd be arm'd cap-a-pee, In Battles to strike us with Dread: Go seek for your Spear and your Shield, Your Wife will take care of your Head. Then ne'er be dismay'd in the Field, Tho' Numbers around you fall dead, And Bullets shou'd fly thick as Hail, There's nothing can damage your Head. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Robin Hood. Good Father Graspall, to confess the Truth, Age vainly hopes to win a Smile from Youth: What gentle Terms can't gain, our Cunning may, Grant your Consent, I'll bear the Maid away: You'll too go with us, ere to-morrow Night We'll force a Marriage in her own despight. Graspall. With all my heart, and I'll the Means prepare, We'll find a way to tame you Lady fair. [Exit. SCENE IX. Robin Hood. And I'll a Letter to Clarinda send, Shall make her see how much I stand her Friend. AIR. How pleasing the Thought, to deliver the Fair From the Chains of harsh Bondage, and rigid Despair! To lighten her Sorrows, and dry up each Tear, Till the Roses of Beauty again shall appear; Till the Smile that's half-smother'd reveals her Intent, And the Blush shall speak for her, her Heart is content. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SCENE, before Graspall's House. Enter Robin Hood and Graspall. Graspall. I cannot yet the stubborn Girl subdue: Try, good Sir Humphrey, try what you can do. R. Hood. I make no doubt to win the clay-cold Maid, I'll answer for't she'll like my Serenade. AIR. I'll borrow the Wings of the Sparrow and Dove, And then I will fly to discover my Love: The People so low, who behold me so high, Will wonder what strange sort of Bird's in the Sky: While still on I soar To her I adore, And till I get at her will never give o'er. SCENE II. Primrose appears. Primrose. What Noise is that does every Sense affright? Sure all the Cats have strol'd abroad to Night. AIR. Foretelling the Rain, The Raven his Strain, Thus caws through the Regions of Air; And Moll, thro' the Cloisters, Sings out, Buy my Oisters, In Notes that with thine may compare. R. Hood. Thy Wit is shrewd, this to thy Mistress bear, This Purse, good Primrose, shall reward thy Care. [He throws a Letter and Purse in at the Window. Graspall. I wish you good Success, but yet I dread This vile Leander turns the Wench's Head. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Chamber. Enter Clarinda and Primrose. Clarinda. Oh gen'rous Robin Hood! thy Care demands Eternal Obligation at my Handsâ Do thou, dear Primrose, seek our foolish Squire; Tell the pert Wretch I him alone admire: Let him with all his Speed our Steps pursue, Else I am ever ravish'd from his View. [Ex. Prim. AIR. Happy Scene of gay Delight! Warm my Breast, and sooth my Care; Love will e'er assert his Right; Then let Lovers ne'er despair. Bring me Lilies, bring me Roses, Myrtle Wreaths and blooming Posies: Haste you, Nymphs, and hither bring All the Trophies of the Spring. Baleful Cypress cast aside, (Emblem of despairing Love) And the weeping Willow hide Near the inauspicious Grove. Bring me Lilies, bring me Roses, Myrtle Wreaths and blooming Posies: Haste you, Nymphs, and hither bring All the Trophies of the Spring. SCENE IV. Enter Graspall and Robin Hood. Graspall. Still must I beg, and pray, and all in vain? And shall I ne'er a Father's Right obtain? What I propose, you stubbornly refuse, And shun the worthy Gentleman I choose. R. Hood. The Hand of Time has bleach'd each changing Hair, My Person long has ceas'd to charm the Fair; But I've a Soul that ne'er did Falshood know, A Heart that melts at a sweet Lady's woe; A Hand that still can hardy Acts atchieve, Redress the Wrong'd, and make Oppression grieve. Clarinda. Sir, to your Merits I my Heart resign: And now, my Father, all your Will is mine. Graspall. There's a good Wench: Yet let us haste away, Lest Glitter should prevent us. Clarinda. I obey. R. Hood. 'Tis scarce six Miles we have to go to-night; To-morrow, when the Sun resumes his Light, The chaste Clarinda shall a Husband find, One that is form'd to make a Virgin kind. AIR. [R. Hood.] I'm like the Sage, whose learned Eye Has chanc'd among the Flow'rs to spy, In pride of Youth, a Butterfly, And caught the beauteous Prize. Clar. The Maid, whose Squirrel breaks his Chain, From Sighs and Tears cannot refrain; But, if the Wanton come again, She feels such Joys as I. Grasp. The Miser, that a Guinea more Discovers added to his Store, With Transport finds his Heart run o'er; My Joys are full as great. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Another Chamber. Enter Glitter and Primrose, meeting. Primrose. Well met, smart Youth! my Mistress bid me say, Against her Will they hurry her away; Tow'rds Sherwood-Forest they their Journey bend, Your only Hopes on Diligence depend: Your fleetest Racer instantly bestride, O'ertake them, and Clarinda is your Bride. Glitter. I'll be as quick as Light'ning, never fear; I pay your Kindness with this Kiss, my Dear. [Exit Primrose. SCENE VI. Glitter. The Fair admire me wheresoe'er I go; 'Twas just the same at Rome, at Paris so. AIR. I can ogle and leer, Signor si, Oui Monsieur, And shew them a Leg that is taper; Take Snuff with an Air, Like a Gentleman swear, And I challenge the World atâ a Caper. [Exit. SCENE VII. The Forest. Enter Robin Hood, Graspall, Clarinda and Primrose. R. Hood. Fear not, sweet Maid, you soon shall see your Swain, And, lost in Joy, forget your former Pain. SCENE VIII. Enter Glitter and Servants. Glitter. Oh, there they areâgood Mr. Graspall, you Are strictly just, and to your Promise true. What do you in yon wither'd Elder see, That you prefer him to a Man like me? Here I am come, Sir, to assert my Right, We're four to twoâtho' I choose not to fight. [Aside. R. Hood. Wise Glitter, mark me; and old Father, here To what I utter lend a patient Ear. AIR. I'll sing you a Song that will suit us all round; The Tale may displease, yet the Moral is sound: A Virgin as sweet as a Morning in May, Once lov'd a young Shepherd (of Merit) they say. But her Father refus'd him, for he had not got Gold, As Av'rice too often will cleave to the Old; To a Coxcomb he'd give her, well furnish'd with Pence, Who had ev'ry Endowmentâsave Honour and Sense. But bold Robin Hood, in a lucky Disguise, Impos'd on the Wretch, tho' he saw with four Eyes; And you, Master Pert-one, take this for a Rule, No Woman of Spirit will stoop to a Fool. And thus, Sir, not having detain'd you too long, I hope I may merit your Thanks for my Song: If you do not like it, on others I'll call; Come, trip o'er the green Sword, my merry Men all. Enter Scarlet, John, and Foresters, and seize all the Men. R. Hood. Seize these two Wretches, while I step aside, And fetch a Husband for my chosen Bride. [Exit. Graspall. Ah, would the Earth would swallow me, I'm wild, My shameful Av'rice has undone my Child. Clarinda. Unhappy me, to live to see this Day; But those ne'er prosper who their Loves betray. Glitter to Primrose. All this I owe to your officious Care, A Chambermaid's the Devil every where. AIR. Clarinda. Is this my kind Father? A Tyrant, say rather, The Cause of a Daughter's Undoing: Primrose. O very wise Master! To bring this Disaster On those who foresaw it was Ruin. Grasp. [aside.] Shall I sooth her, or huff her? Pr. [weeping.] My Virtue will suffer, That still has defy'd each Pursuer. Glitter. How can I dissemble! Like an Aspin I tremble: Ah! I'm an unfortunate Wooer. SCENE IX. Enter Robin Hood and Leander. R. Hood. This Youth, who long has for your Daughter sigh'd, Now sues by me, nor must he be deny'd: Tho' Fortune like a Niggard play'd her Part, Yet what are Riches to a noble Heart. But you, Squire Ape, must leave your Horses here, Your Rings, your Money, and your other Geer: Trudge home on foot, and when you leave the Wood, Tell all you see, You met with Robin Hood. Glitter. Sweet Sir, one Word. R. Hood. If one Word more you speak to change my Mind, You, with your Clothes, shall leave your Skin behind. AIR. Glit. Fast by some dashing Torrent, That thunders o'er the Sea, From Morn to Night I'll weep my Fate Beneath a Willow-Tree. Sighing, pining, Weeping, whining, Beneath a Willow-Tree. Prim. I pity much your Suff'rings; O then be rul'd by me, And put an end to all your Woes Beneath a Willow-Tree. Dingle dangle, Dingle dangle, Beneath a Willow-Tree. [Exit Glitter. SCENE the last. Graspall. Well, since I must, I must, howe'er I'm loth; Rise up, my Children, Heaven bless you both. Leander. Thanks, gen'rous Friend, how much I owe your Care, My future Actions shall at large declare. AIR. Leander. My Idol, my Treasure, The Source of all Pleasure, Words ne'er can my Raptures discover; Clar. I love you, believe me, Then not to deceive me, Profess not too much my young Lover. R. Hood. See how along the East the purple Morn Drives the young Hours, and dims pale Cynthia's Horn; To-day you both a Forest-Chear must prove, At Night we'll leave you to the Sweets of Love. AIR. To an Arbor of Woodbine ye both shall be led, Soft Leaves for your Pillows, the Grass for your Bed, While wanton young Sparrows chirp over your Head, All under the green Wood Shade. When the Moon with pale Lustre just gleams thro' the Grove, And Nightingales answer the chaste Turtle-Dove, The Maid, without blushing, shall grasp her true Love. All under the green Wood Shade. Tho' Frowns for a while arm the Face of the Fair, Yet soon our young Lover forgets all his Care, For Phillis cries, Do not, oh! do not despair. All under the green Wood Shade. CHORUS. Dance, and sing, and sport, and play, 'Tis Clarinda's Wedding-Day. FINIS.</field>
