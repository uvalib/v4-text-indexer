      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by the Honourable Charles Boyle, Esq; Our Bard resolv'd to quit this wicked Town, And all Poetick Offices lay down: But the weak Brother was drawn in again, And a cast Mistress tempted him to Sin. Thus many a cautious Gallant in this Throng, May wed, when old, whom they debauch'd when young. Thus the repenting fair Ones vow in vain From Cards, from Love, from Scandal to refrain, For Easter over, they relapse again. To write well's hard: But I appeal to y' all, Is't not much harder not to write at all? Some Men must write, for Writing's their Disease, And every Poet's sure one Man to please. Some medling Coxcombs, rather than sit still, And perfectly do nothing, must do ill. Some are with busie Dulness so o're-run, They seem design'd by Heav'n to teaze the Town. Yet when these Fools have spawn'd some sickly Play, We have so many greater Fools than they, They'll pack a crowded Audience the third Day. This Poet has no sly inveigling Arts, He'll try to gain, but he'll not steal your Hearts. His Muse is rustick, and perhaps too plain, The Men of squeamish Tastes to entertain: Who none but Dutchesses will daign to toast, And Favours only from front Boxes boast. That's all Grimace: When Appetites are good, Be the Dress course, the Air and Manners rude, You can take up with wholsom Flesh, and Blood. But he despairs of pleasing all the Nation, 'Tis so debauch'd with Whims of Reformation. H'has done his best: Here is no wanton Scene To give the wicked, Joy, the godly, Spleen. Not one poor bawdy Jest shall dare appear, For now the batter'd, Veteran Strumpets here Pretend at least to bring a modest Ear. Here is some Love, 'tis true, some Noise, some War, Enough to please the Belles, the Beaux to scare. Some bustling Patriots too, some Rabble-rout, And Senators of the weak side thrown out. But in all this, here's nothing can offend, Nothing to lose one ancient midnight Friend: He hopes then, when his Cause comes on, they'll all attend. Let Critick Foes remember 'tis past Lent, And all good Christians Curses then were spent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Written by Coll. Codrington, and spoken by Mrs. Barry. Poets fine Titles for themselves may find: I think 'em the Fool-mongers of Mankind. The charitable Quacks indeed pretend, They trade in Fools, only those Fools to mend. Yet they wou'd scarce the nauseous Task endure, But that, like Bedlam Doctors, they are sure To get, by showing Fools they cannot cure. Equal in this, all Plays must be confest; Fool is the fav'rite Dish of the whole Feast. In Farce, the Wit's a Fool, or Fool's a Wit. In Comedy, the Beau pretends a right. But Tragick Writers still agree to plot The greatest Heroe, for the greatest Sot. Our Bard t'indulge your Taste with vast delight, Serv'd up a Senate full of Fools to Night: Same bustled hard for Hannibal, and some Wou'd venture all the Brains they had for Rome. Thus fighting Fools support ambitious Knaves: Whoe're prevail'd, the Capuans still were Slaves. Our pair of Friends shine far above the rest, With double share of Fool, and Heroe blest. Our Lover wou'd not tempt the Lady's Honour; Yet had he boldly pusht, and fairly won her, You'll all allow, he wou'd less harm have done her. Joys well contriv'd are had at easier price. Thank Heav'n our British Friends are not so nice. Our most important Fool is still behind: The Man was marry'd, Sirs, and sick in mind. 'Twas a meer whim of Honour cost his Life. The squeamish Capuan wou'd not share his Wife. Why Wives are Wives: And he that will be billing, Must not think Cuckoldom deserves a killing. What if the gentle Creature had been kissing, Nothing the good Man marry'd for, was missing. Besides the Rights of Ladies sacred are: He shou'd have been content with Neighbours Fare. But she, by her coy Gallant's Crime, was good, And was not won, because she was not woo'd. Had he the secret of his Birth-right known, 'Tis odds the faithful Annals wou'd have shown, The Wives of half this Race, more luckie than his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Senate. Pac. This only I wou'd offer to you more: My known Alliances, and kindred Blood, By intercourse of Marriages with Rome, Cementing long the Honour of my House, With all the interests of that glorious State, May well protest for me, that I advise Abandoning the Romans to their Fate, As necessary to avert our own. 2 Sen. To avert our own! Pac. At least you'l join with me, It may be needful to advance our own. 2 Sen. Ay, there I close with you when you speak plain. The Romans Loss at Cannæ shows it self Plainly in this, that their Confederates, Who had stood Ages fast and firm for Rome, From that most dreadful Day began to fail; Deserting her in absolute Despair Of her lost Empire, not to be restor'd. 1 Sen. You have a List of all the several States, People, and Cities that are faln away From Rome to the Carthaginians: Let it be read— Pac. It has been read already. Their Number and Example shou'd advise Their Neighbours, who intend to follow 'em As we must do, to follow cheerfully; To jump into our Resolutions; What must be done, to have it frankly done; To make a merit of our Forwardness; And not disgrace the Service we intend, By cold Debates, Indifference and Delay. 2 Sen. Our Rabble are in barefac'd Mutiny. 3 Sen. And have declar'd themselves for Hannibal. [Shouts in several quarters of the City. 1 Sen. The noise comes this way now. 2 Sen. 'Tis every where. Enter Decius Magius. [Within.] Make way for Decius Magius. Pac. Decius Magius! I thought he had giv'n o're the Common-wealth. Mag. I thought so too: But there is nothing certain: I was in hopes I might have staid at home: But when a City is in general Flame, Cripples will find their Legs to cry out Fire. Age has not much to lose: But I am come To awake, to rouze, and warn you of your Ruin. Pac. What is this Ruin, Decius Magius? Mag. In such an honourable Argument, As yours may be, in the Tarentine War, A Peace from Pyrrhus was propos'd with Rome: The Question almost was resolv'd for Pyrrhus: When Appius, as we have it on Record, Aged and blind, disabled long before To the State's Service, and the publick Cares, Was led into the Senate, and inspir'd By Indignation, and his Country's Cause, Sway'd the Debate, never to make a Peace With any foreign Foe in Italy. I come by his Example: He was happy In his Success; and so may I be blest, So may I thrive to Day, as this great Cause That lies before you now is of more worth, Of weightier worth, and threatning Consequence. Pac. A long Preamble: What will be the Tale? Mag. They say, you are upon deserting Rome, And joyning Hannibal: I have a Voice Before it comes to that, and must be heard. Pac. We have all Voices for our Countries good. Mag. Our Country's Honour is her chiefest good. Can we forget what Rome has been to us? A fostering Neighbour of our Infant State: A kind Rejoycer in our Growth and Strength: Ever a Friend: And in Adversity, (As we have tasted of that bitter Cup, Now swill'd in Pleasures to the giddy Brim Of drunken Riot, and Forgetfulness:) In our bad Days, I say, she still has been A Comforter, a Parent, and Protector. Pac. Well, Decius Magius, had you minded us, If we had been inclining to forget What, as Allies and Friends, we owe to Rome. But Vibius Virius, you our Legate were, Commission'd to Rome's Consul: You can say— Vib. That we have paid all our Respects of Grief; Condol'd their Dire Misfortunes, offering Supplies of all things wanting to their Wars: This in the general Name of Capua: But Cordials to the Dead are so apply'd: Fortune has left 'em nothing to supply. The Roman Legions, Ensigns, Horse, and Arms, Men, Money, and Provisions, routed, spoil'd, All in the Day of Cannæ were destroy'd, Or on the Morrow's Plunder of both Camps. Pac. So that 'tis not enough to aid 'em now: If you do any thing you must resolve To undertake their War with Hannibal. Mag. And can you undertake a worthier Cause? Is there a worthier, than a social War? Our Ancestors compell'd within these Walls, No longer able to Defend the City, The Samnites, Cidicines, investing us, Sinking in Ruin, who upheld us then? Who, but the Romans, cou'd have sav'd us then? They took us trembling to Protection: Sustain'd a Warr for near a Hundred Years, With Fortune often varying the Event, Dreadful to Italy, against the Samnites, Which they begun, and carry'd on for us: And is there nothing to be done for them? 4. Sen. Why, that is true; if we cou'd do it, Without an injury to our selves. Mag. Have we not always been affianc'd Friends? Our Laws, our Customs, Constitutions Allmost a-kin, and, as our Marriages, Mingled, and wove into our mutual Weal? The Citizens of Rome, and Capua, Enjoying common rights of Burghesie, Speak us indeed one People in two States. So that whatever mischiefs fall on them, Betide us too; and we must stand oblig'd, By all the Bonds of honest Interest, To save a Country, equal to us both. 5 Sen. That I don't so well understand neither. Mag. This is no Samnite, no Hetrurian War; Where if one lose a Neighbour State must win; And tho' the Empire shou'd be torn from Rome, It still remains with us in Italy. We shall not find it so with Foreigners: The Carthaginians are these Foreigners: The Carthaginians are our Enemies— Pac. Hold, have a care— Mag. I will, to speak the truth; And say again they are our Enemies: Rivals of Empire, in this second War: And therefore to be thought the common Foes Of Rome, of Capua, and of Italy. 4 Sen. Urg'd home, and boldly. Mag. O! let us pay the debt of Glory now! Tho' Rome be drooping, we may raise her Head. Our Forces are unbroken, fresh, entire: Full thirty thousand Foot, four thousand Horse, Upon our Musters in Campania: Money, Munitions, and Provisions, With the proud Train and Equipage of War, Martiall'd, and ready Harness'd for the Field, All high of Heart, and full of able Proof. If then our Friendship, and Fidelity, Answer the firmness of our Strength and Power, Hannibal will not perceive his Victory; No, nor the Romans feel their sore defeat. [Shouts again. Enter a Messenger. 3 Sen. Here comes another Messenger. 4 Sen. The news? Mess. If I had breath, it is not to be told. The madding Rabble have at last possest The sober part, the peaceful Citizens, Infected by their fury, are in Arms; And Capua now is but one Multitude. Pac. There is no time for Foreign Argument Of right and just; of future good or ill: Since what we have to fear, is present now, Imminent, and breaking on our Heads at home. Enter Marius Blosius. Make way—good Marius Blosius take your seat: We know you've done the best you can for us: When you're collected, you will tell us all. Blo. Disorders, Tumults, and Confusions, Raging with Horror up and down our Streets, Had spent themselves in Opposition Of their contending Parties; there we hop'd The Uproar wou'd have end: But now they join, Rabble and Citizens, in horrid League, And all combin'd in Violence, resolve On Mischiefs more premeditate and bold. 1 Sen. Resolve on what? 2 Sen. What Mischiefs are resolv'd? Blo. All who are Romans found in Capua, (As we have Families transplanted here) Tho' in the service of our State employ'd, Or in their private Callings, they have seiz'd— Mag. How! seiz'd! Blo. Men, Women, Children, hudled in the Rout, Without distinction hurry'd and shut up, Under the name of Safety, in our Baths, The publick Baths, where choak'd with Heat and Smoak, Their strugling Souls must wretchedly expire, If timely not set free. Mag. If this goes on Ruin must follow: I will spare no Pains For their Deliverance. [Magius goes out. 1 Sen. Wretched indeed! 2 Sen. Barbarous and cruel to our worst of Foes, Without a Name to our Allies and Friends! Pac. No Friendship, no Alliance after this. What they have done, is a sad Argument They will do more to carry to their ends. Blo. Nay, there is more in hand, and to be fear'd, Directed this way too: For, One and all, They cry, the Senate's Councils are too slow, That they intend to come and quicken 'em— 1 Sen. The Gods forbid! 2 Sen. Avert this Danger, Heav'n! Blo. But that we shall no longer buy and sell Their Interests, with our mercenary Tongues: That we but hold the Government in trust For them, they all have Law enough for that, They say, they can recall it when they please. They'l do their Work themselves; they'l have no more To do with us; we never did 'em good, Before this time; and now against our will; Affording 'em such just occasion To throw us off, Senate and Tyranny. 3 Sen. Heav'n grant it go no farther. 2 Sen. But I fear— 3 Sen. They bear us ancient hate on former Scores: And what the Priviledge of such lawless Times, May set 'em on to act, is to be fear'd. Blo. Nay, what portends the worst, and threatens most: This head-long Rout, this lew'd ungover'd Crew, Is Captain'd, headed, and led on by some, The noblest Blood, and foremost of our Youth: Who ne're will think their services well pay'd, But at the price of universal Change. 1 Sen. They're at our Doors. [Shouts nearer. 2 Sen. What will become of us! Enter a Messenger. Mes. Fly, fly you Senators of Capua: There is no safety for you, but in Flight: The People are determin'd in your Doom, And now come on to Execution: They've vow'd to Murder you, and so give up The Common-wealth void of all Government To Hannibal, and Carthaginian Power, To model new, and stamp what form he please: As the best Sacrifice, the justest Means, To attone his wrath, and punish your delay. Pac. Let us not stand confounded in our fears: [Shouts again. Gaping on one another, as relief, Without our care, wou'd drop into our Mouths. 2 Sen. What can we do? 1 Sen. We wou'd do any thing. 3 Sen. No God to pity us! 4 Sen. Pacuvius, you have been the Peoples Friend; Wou'd we had all. 1 Sen. Ay, good Pacuvius, You might do much, would you appear for us. Pac. I had some credit with 'em: what 'tis now— 2 Sen. They will hear you. Pac. I cannot promise that. But what I can, I will: perhaps I may Do more than you expect—but then you must Give up your Faith entire to what I do; Lay by your Fewds, and Factions in the Senate; Submitting all to my Direction. Omn. Dispose of all, so you deliver us. [Exeunt. SCENE, The Outside of the Palace. [Shouts again. Pacuvius enters with Guards. Virginius heading the Rabble. Pac. Shut up the Gates; none to pass in or out, But by my Orders: if a Senator Escapes your Guard, you answer with your lives To our great Lords the People. 1 Cit. Why, here's a Lord indeed. Vir. He does not think himself too great To be the Peoples Friend. 2 Cit. No, no, Lord Pacuvius has been always our Friend: And we will be his upon Occasion: for he shall find himself, Within this half hour, the only Senator unhang'd in Capua. Pac. My Country-men; my fellow Citizens! 'Tis in your Power now to revenge your selves On this detested Senate, justly fal'n Under your Sentence; odious grown to all, Who love the People, or the Common-wealth. I offer you a full and safe Revenge, A free Revenge, nothing to Interrupt, But you may do your Work with decency: No Tumult for one Senator to scape in. Without the danger of invading 'em In their particular Houses, which wou'd be Defended by their Friends, Clients, and Slaves, I have 'em here, defenceless, and alone, Imprison'd in the Palace. Say the word What shall be done with 'em? 1 Cit. Come, come, open the Gates, We'll quickly dispose of 'em. 2 Cit. Ay, ay, we are Men of Expedition, And so they shall find us, to their Cost: Every Man take his Senator; We'll hang 'em Upon the Battlements of the Palace, for a stinking Example to all Common-wealths. 1 Cit. Hold you, hold you, I don't like hanging: There's a great deal to be done in a handsom Execution. 3 Cit. Look you, my Masters, I am but a plain Man to see to, as a body may say, but I can speak my Mind without being askt, as soon as those that are wiser: Look you, time is precious, and we have a great deal to do with it; make as short work as you can, I advise; ev'n cut their Throats, and there's an end on't. 1 Cit. Cutting of Throats is but a Slovenly way of doing Justice: I am for doing things decently, Neighbours, and I believe I have hit it: This is not an ordinary Day with us, you know, Why then let's make a Holy-day of it indeed; Set the Palace a Fire about the Senators Ears, And there's a Bonfire to our Holy-day. Om. Agreed, agreed, a Bonfire, a Bonfire. Pac. It was the very thing I was thinking of— 1 Cit. Why very well. Pac. Nay, it is excellent, To have the old Drones smother'd in their Hives. Om. No more to be said, Boys; About it instantly, my Lads. 2 Cit. We are all in a mind once in our Lives. Om. Fire the Palace, down with it, Fire the Palace. Pac. And yet what has this noble building done? A publick Ornament, a reverend Pile, That has stood Ages—but if you please to think It has stood long enough, why, down with it; Who shall find fault? It is the Common-wealths, The People's, and you may dispose your own. 1 Cit. How's that? The Palace Ours! Let's hear him a little upon that Subject. Pac. The Senators! blow them up in a Blaze: You will miss nothing of 'em, but their Beards: Or if you should, they cheaply are supply'd. But if the Senate House be laid in Ashes, Who shall repair the Ruine? Vir. At a time when Capua stands the Rival of great Rome, You would not strip her of her Palaces, To leave her naked to her Neighbours scorn? Om. No, no, We don't desire that neither. Vir. This venerable Structure may stand up With our most celebrated publick Domes, Sacred and Common, Temples, Theatres, And all our numerous progeny of Art, The Monuments of famous Ancestry, That speak as loud for us, as Rome's for her. And wou'd you throw it down? Pac. If you repent, when it is down, who builds it up again? The publick Purse alone, the common Stock (The Citizens freeborn Inheritance) Whoever does the mischief, pays for all. 1 Cit. If it be so, my Masters! 2 Cit. 'Tis as he says, Man, and the case is quite alter'd. 1 Cit. Why, my Lord, we're at a loss here For want of Employment. 2 Cit. You have sav'd the Building, 'tis true, And we thank you for't: But the Senators— Om. Ay, ay, the Senators, the Senators— Pac. I am their Goaler still, to answer their forth-coming, When you please, and to promote the Justice you intend, Since you are not agreed among your selves, I do propose to bring each Senator Upon the tryal of his single Merit, To stand or fall, just as his Cause deserves: Your selves to be the Judges. 2 Cit. Why there you have hit it, my Lord: 1 Cit. Every honest Man must be Of your Lordship's Mind. Vir. Your selves to be the Judges! Mark you that? 1 Cit. Well, my Lord, Pray proceed in your own Method: We know you're a Friend to us, We'll be govern'd by you. Pac. Then in the first place, I wou'd have you So govern your Anger, that your Anger get Not the upper hand of your Int'rest and Safety. For I suppose your Hatred extends to these Senators only; You like the Constitution well enough— 2 Cit. My Lord, that's more than we can say With a safe Conscience. Pac. What! Not like a Senate! 1 Cit. To tell you the truth, we don't approve of th'Order, And wou'd banish it the City, if we cou'd. Vir. You must have a Government among you. Pac. You must have a Senate; a Senate is But the great Council of a free People, And that's for your Good you must own. 2 Cit. Well, if we must have a Senate— Pac. Why, that's well said: Then in order to a Reformation, my Masters, There are two things that call upon you at the same time; The dissolving your old Senate, And chusing a new one in the room. 1 Cit. Why, there I grant you, A Senate of our own chusing we may like. 2 Cit. We'll chuse a Senate, I warrant you. Pac. I will summon the Senators, One after another, to appear before you: What you judge of 'em shall be executed: I will only gather your Voices. 1 Cit. This is method now. Pac. Unbar the Gates, and bid the Senators Prepare themselves to appear upon their Names. 2 Cit. Ay, this is doing business. Pac. But one thing you must promise me, my Friends, To punish none, however criminal, Before you chuse an able, honest Man Into his place, as a new Senator. 1 Cit. That's fair on every side. Pac. Here is a Roll, agree among your selves Whom to cite first— This Day must crown our hopes. [Going to Virginius. Vir. The Deputies are return'd from Hannibal. Pac. Let 'em be ready, I shall want 'em straight. 2 Cit. Let's see, let's see, where shall we begin, At the top or the bottom. 3 Cit. Hold you, hold you; Titus Didius here; begin at him: I hapned to get a Slave of his with Child, And he made me marry her, for which I shou'd be very glad to see him hang'd. 4 Cit. Make 'em into Lots, I say, And let 'em be drawn fairly. Om. Ay, ay, every Man take his chance. [They are busied in making the Lots, while Pacuvius and Virginius speak.] Pac. O that Perolla, my degenerate Son, Wou'd follow thy Ambition; but he pules, And Conscience bound in such a Cause as this, The Cause of Empire, basely stands for Rome Against his Country, and his Father's House. Vir. That Decius Magius has infected him. Pac. My old Opposer still. Vir. He has been every where among the Crowd, To spread the Poyson of his Politicks: But we had dos'd 'em with our Antidotes; Timely preventing all the giddy turns, That might have hapned to that sickly State; Confirm'd the crazy Constitution Of their weak, wavering Minds; and now we have Scatter'd, dispers'd the Faction, and the Cause, Quite routed him, and his malignity. Pac. So that the People all stand sound for us. But do not trust 'em with themselves too long: They will relapse into their natural fears, And cool, without your Fire to keep 'em warm. Vir. These you'll take care of: I have other parties To Head, and bring up on occasion. [Exit. The Citizens come forward, one having drawn a Lot. 1 Cit. So, so, without favour, or affection, now open it— Pac. Who have you drawn? 2 Cit. Rutilius Lupus. [Reading the name. Pac. Rutilius Lupus there, let him appear. 1 Cit. Ay, ay, let him appear, And be hang'd for his pains, I say. 3 Cit. Ay, so say I. Om. And all of us. Rutilius Lupus Enters. 2 Cit. Here, here, he comes. He has always been an Enemy to the People. 1 Cit. And now we'll quit scores with him. Pac. Well, he is doom'd: You do expel him first The Senate—but before his Punishment, You must elect a New one in his Room. Om. Ay, ay, that's quickly done. Pac. He may pass on, we'll talk with him anon. 1 Cit. Who shall we chuse Neighbours? 2 Cit. Let's lay our Heads together, [R. Lupus withdraws. And do it to purpose, once in our Lives. 1 Cit. Why, ay, who shall we chuse? 2 Cit. Let me see— 1 Cit. Some body that deserves very well of the Commons. Om. That's to be sure. 1 Cit. One that is in the interest of his Country; And, if possible, will continue so In spight of Preferment— 2 Cit. That's the Man, that's the Man. 3 Cit. Who, who? 2 Cit. Nay, good troth, I can't tell; We han't found him yet. 1 Cit. He must be one, we have nothing to say against— 3 Cit. Ay, marry, who may that be? 1 Cit. One who wonnot forget his Benefactors, The People that rais'd him. 2 Cit. A very good Quality indeed; Now name the Man that owns it, and I give him my Voice. 1 Cit. Nay, I name no Body. 3 Cit. Name no Body! what! We must name some Body: Come, I'le name one—Cecilius Nepos.— Om. Cecilius Nepos! there's a Man indeed! 3 Cit. What do ye think of him? Om. We don't think of him. 2. Cit. Stay, stay, the Senators are call'd Fathers, You know— 1 Cit. What then? 2 Cit. Why, in that sense he may be qualify'd: And thou dost honestly to set him up. For he is naturally thy Senator, Being the Father of thy Family. 1 Cit. No, no, we'll Father our Children without him, If we can, with our Wives leave, we'll none of him. Set up another. 4 Cit. Titus Volcatius. Om. That's worse and worse. 1 Cit. What shall we do with him? 2 Cit. He knows nothing of the matter. 1 Cit. When he shows any management In his private Affairs, we may Begin to think of him for the Publick: In the mean time, let him play the fool At his own expence, and in private; As he uses to do. 4 Cit. Mamellius then. 1 Cit. Mamellius! who is he? 2 Cit. He is one, that was squeez'd out of the Necessities of the Government; that has made a hard shift to get a mighty Estate, by the common Calamities; a plaguy rich Fellow. 1 Cit. Rich! as a dunghil may be, By a Congregation of Filth and Villany. 2 Cit. Wou'd he were to be so well bestow'd; Carry'd out by a common consent, for he's a Nusance As he is, and spread abroad for the enriching the Publick. 1 Cit. O, ho, I know him, a Viper, that has eaten thro' the Bowels of his Country, in hopes of coming to the Head on't: But I hope he will return as he came, and go out at the Tail. 2 Cit. Well, Furius Philus. 1 Cit. He's too proud for us. 2 Cit. Marcus Mutius. 1 Cit. Let him pay his debts. 2 Cit. He pays no Body, as 'tis. 1 Cit. And you wou'd give him a priviledge To ruine his Neighbours. Pac. Well, are you agreed? 1 Cit. Agreed, my Lord, there's nothing to agree upon: When we come to particulars, 'tis only to find fault: Men are but men; and, new or old, The Senate's the same. Pac. Why do you dissolve this then? 2 Cit. We don't dissolve it. Om. No, no, we don't dissolve it. 1 Cit. And for this Reason, Neighbours, to carry home to your Wives, to stop their Mouths withal; because the Evils that we are best acquainted with, are always the easiest to be born. 2 Cit. Marry I think so too. Om. And all of us. 2 Cit. Therefore I am for setting The Senators at Liberty. Om. Ay, ay, set 'em at Liberty. 2. Cit. Provided they joyn with us in this business. 1 Cit. Heartily, and speedily, or we shall visit 'em again. And so you may tell 'em, my Lord. [Exeunt shouting. Pac. I wonnot fail. Enter Senators. 1 Sen. Pacuvius! O! what Honours are thy due! Statues, and Temples, thou Deliverer! 2 Sen. We cannot speak our humble thanks too low, In the deep sense of our acknowledgments. 3 Sen. Thou hast sav'd our Lives, dispose of them and us— 4 Sen. Our Fortunes, Friends, and dearest Interests. 1. Sen. Command in all, for we owe all to thee. Pac. I have been the happy Instrument indeed To serve the Senate— 2 Sen. Nay, to save the State. Pac. And I am nobly pay'd in the good work. 1 Sen. The People tho' won't be so satisfi'd. Pac. No, they are obstinate upon their Terms, You must comply with 'em. 2 Sen. We are agreed in every Article for Hannibal. 3 Sen. And wou'd declare our selves, did not our Friends— Pac. Under the Roman Arms in Cicily— 3 Sen. As Hostages for our Fidelity, Withhold us, till we can provide for them. Pac. That fear was urg'd before; but you shall have It fully answer'd by our Deputies: I see they are return'd. Om. O! welcome, welcome! 2 Sen. What have you done for us with Hannibal? Dep. We bring most advantageous Terms of Peace. These the Conditions; the last of which [Offering a Paper. Removes the present fear, and does provide Expresly for our Friends in Cicily. 3 Sen. Let that be read. Pac. Nay, read 'em not in parts. Dep. He offers you three Hundred Roman Knights, Which you shall chuse out of his Prisoners, To give the Romans, in a fair Exchange, For our Campanian Youth in Arms with them. 1 Sen. He has hit upon the sole Expedient, To ensure the Lives and Safety of our Friends. Pac. He offers more than we cou'd ask of him. Dep. You'll find him in all points as generous. Pac. Now are you satisfy'd? 3 Sen. We ask no more. Dep. In the just confidence of profer'd Love, He comes himself, the Hostage of his Faith, To Capua. Blo. So my Advices say, but mention not the time. Dep. He comes this Day: He's on his March already. 1 Sen. Let us prepare for his Reception. Pac. Summon the People to the Forum then, And let the Articles be read to 'em: So hand in hand we shall proceed in Love, And act unenvy'd for our Country's good. [Going. Enter Decius Magius. Mag. Pacuvius! You have done most worthily, Saving the Senate: Wou'd you wou'd employ Your Interest with the People always so. The wretched Romans wanted such a Friend: I had no Pow'r: But Death has set 'em free. 1 Sen. Dead! Are they dead? [The Senators go out one after another, and leave him alone. Mag. All perisht in the Baths. And they are left behind, to blush in Blood For this Day's Treason, who encourag'd it: It must be answer'd for to Gods and Men, And Capua rue it in her Sons unborn; An impious City of devoted Crimes! The Vengeance will fall heavy, and, I fear, Fall wide enough, ev'n to involve us all. 1 Sen. Alas! We are not guilty of their Death. [Goes out. 2 Sen. But mourn alike with you the People's Rage. [Goes out. 3 Sen. What cou'd we do? [Goes out. Mag. What are you doing now? Where are you going? Do you leave me too? But you indeed have left me long ago. Your Steps have err'd long from the track of Truth, And are not worth an honest Man's pursuit: But I will follow. If I can't prevent, I may protest against their Practices: That's in my Pow'r: That will exempt me from The general Guilt, and justifie my Fame: Let me secure my Innocence, and then Death to an Old Man cannot come too soon. [Exit. SCENE, Virginius's House. Favonia at work with her Women. A Song written by a Lady. What's Beauty? Bright Favonia, tell. The Mistress of it knows it well. 'Tis not Colour, 'tis not Feature, Easie Fashion, nor good Nature: Good Teeth, and Hair, a smiling Grace, Can't give Perfection to a Face: Not yielding Lips, or wishing Eyes: But she is handsom who denies. A Song in Answer written by a Gentleman. What Beauty is, let Strephon tell, Who oft has try'd it, knows it well: Not all the Wonders of a Face, Where Nature triumphs in each Grace, Not Snowy Breasts, thro' which is seen The purple Flood that boils within, Not Lips, when Wit with ease beguiles, Whilst playsom Cupids dance in Smiles, Not Youth, not Shape, not Air, not Eyes, She only charms me who complies. Virginius enters to 'em. Vir. Among your Women in your Huswifry! Fye, 'tis a Profanation of the Day, Sacred, and set apart from common use, And dedicated to the publick Joy. Fav. The publick Joy, my Lord! Vir. The general Joy: In which I have secur'd a part for thee, A liberal share for my Favonia. Fav. May I secure my private Peace at home: And for the publick, let the Joy, and Grief, Fall to their different Fates, who rise and fall. The State does not concern a Woman's Care: Yet, Sir, I thank you for remembring me. Vir. Dost thou! Well, there's something ev'n in that; There is a kind of Gratitude in Thanks, Tho' it be barren, and bring forth but Words. Fav. I do not understand— Vir. Thou dost not; true: And that's the very root of my Complaint, That any thing relating to my Love Shou'd still be strange, not understood by thee. Fav. My Lord— Vir. O! thou art cold in my reception, Thou can'st not think thy self, but thou art cold. I wou'd have met my Welcome in thy Arms, My eager Welcome in thy longing Arms, That shou'd have crush'd me inward to thy Heart, Into thy Heart, if it were possible, Throbbing and beating with the Pulse of Love: That, that had been a Welcome fit for me; And a just Recompence of all my Pains. Fav. Indeed, my Lord, I owe you every thing, In recompence of what you have done for me: But for your welcome, that you bring along With you; 'tis yours, as you are Master here: And if I have not serv'd it up to you, As does become the Duty of my place, With that frank Cheerfulness to give content, Let me not answer for my Nature's Faults. Vir. Nay, now thou art too serious. Fav. I am unhappy in the want of all Those necessary, natural Arts to please. Vir. Thou art above the little reach of Arts, And can'st want nothing, but the Will, to please. Fav. What is there that I can invite you to, That you do not dispose of? Vir. Nothing, nothing: Thou art all mine; and let me tell my Heart, That hourly grows more covetous of thy Love, And therefore busie to torment it self, Its Fears are vain, and thou art wholy mine. Fav. I own your Title, and you are the Lord Of every thing that does belong to me. Vir. Why, what wou'd I have more? There's nothing more. I do confess that I am happier Than I deserve to be; much happier: I commit many Faults, but none to thee. O! cou'd thy gentleness of Soul infuse Its Spirit into my Breast, to temper mine; How shou'd I then be blest! But who can tell? Perhaps 'tis better order'd as it is. Indifference wou'd never suit my Fate. My Passions are unruly, and sometimes Break loose on my best Friends: But then you shou'd Consider 'em as the effects of Love: As the effects! Nay, they are Love it self For Love it self is all the Passions, At least to me: Whether it be Desire, Or Hope, or Fear, or Anger, or Revenge, In all its different Motions, still 'tis Love. Love, Love! The great Incendiary here! His Torch sets all this little World on Fire: And let it burn, to purifie my flame: For Life and Love shall both burn out together. Servant enters to him. Serv. Sir, you are stay'd for. Vir. So, so, well, I come. I have forgot my self, my business too, With looking on thee. Can'st thou tell me, Love, What 'twas I came about? Fav. Business, you say. Vir. I fancy'd I had mighty business here: But now I find 'twas but a fond pretence To come and visit thee. Fav. You're always kind. Vir. The hurry and the struggle of the Day, You were Inform'd in by my Messengers: Fav. They hourly brought me the particulars. And there are somethings done, which I could wish— Vir. Things which I thought I cou'd not have allow'd: And, but to raise thy Fortune, never wou'd— Fav. Pray heav'n they do not overturn it quite. Vir. But they must pass with others in the Crowd. There will be mischief in confusion: I had forgot: Thou art a Stranger still To the sad News: Thy Rival is no more. Fav. My Rival! Vir. Yes, thy Rival in my heart: You had it all between you, Wife and Friend: Junius, that Friend is dead. Fav. Dead! Is he dead? Vir. He fell at Cannæ: Had he been alive, And still a Roman in his interest; I never cou'd have been a Foe to Rome. I have an hour of grief to Dedicate— But this is not the time. I'm call'd upon. Hanibal comes, the glorious Hannibal. His entry will be most Magnificent, And will reward your Curiosity. I will provide you Place, and send for you. [Exit. Favonia alone. Fav. What? what is there that I can want on Earth, To fill the measure of my happiness? Why am I not contented with my Lot? So kind a Husband falls not to the fate Of every Wife: All that he says, and does, All his designs are working still for me: And yet I cannot thank him, as I ought. Not but I ever had a dutious Sense— But that is not the payment of the Heart. He asks my Love, and not my Gratitude. And why is that deny'd? O! Junius! But thou art dead, and I may name thee now. I made it Criminal to pronounce his Name, Avoiding every way all news of him, Endeavouring to forget him, if I cou'd. But Oh! the torment, and the rack of Soul! To keep our thoughts for ever on the bent Upon themselves, still labouring to forget, What, by the labour, we remember more. Why didst thou come between him, and my Heart? Why rather did my Husband place thee there, By bringing thee into the Family? I saw no danger, till it was too late. But what have I not done, and suffer'd too, To drive thee thence, to make Virginius room? I have maintain'd an everlasting War Within this Breast, still fighting on his side: Have summon'd all my succours to my Aid; My Native Powers, and the Confederate Force Of Reason, Duty, Virtue; nay brought down The Woman's last Reserve of all, my Fame: Weak Aids, alas! against the Tyrant Love. But he's depos'd, and Death has set me free: A greater Tyrant gives me Liberty. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Forum. Decius Magius with Perolla, and two or three of his Clients among the Citizens. Mag. A garrison in Capua! O! prevent, Resist their Entrance, block their Passage up. Remember Pyrrhus, and the Tarentines; His insolent Rule, and their subjected State. Per. They are already enter'd. Mag. Let 'em not possess themselves, Expel 'em, drive 'em out: Or if, by a brave memorable Blow, You wou'd redeem your baseness to your Friends, Cut 'em in pieces, and compound with Rome. Per. They are not of your Party. They fall off. [Citizens sneak off. Mag. Old honesty is us'd to stand alone. Per. Here comes my Father. Mag. Good young Man retire: I may say something that you wou'd not hear. Pacuvius with the Senators in their Robes, crossing the Stage. Pac. Widen our Gates; let our encircling Walls Sink in the Earth, that nothing may appear, Ev'n in a seeming Opposition, To stand against the conquering Hannibal: The Conqueror of Rome, but Capua's Friend. 1 Sen. We need no Ramparts now, no Bulwarks, Walls, We're strongly Fortify'd in Hannibal. Mag. What are the Forces that he brings along? Not only Affricans, but Nations drawn From the extreamest limits of the Earth; Hercules's Pillars, and the Ocean's Bounds: Who have no knowledge of Humanity: And but in Humane Speech differ from Beasts: Brutal, and Bloody: but their Leader has Advanc'd their natural Barbarity: Erecting Monstrous Bridges of the Dead, On Human Bodies urging his proud way— 2 Sen. Nay, Decius Magius. Mag. And, as an absolute Master of the Warr, Defying Famaine in his horrid Camp, Has taught 'em to devour the Flesh of Men. 1 Sen. Now, Magius, you grow Dangerous indeed. Mag. Are these to be our Friends? these our Allies? Who that is but a Son of Italy, Can see, and suffer such detested Slaves, Whom but to touch is a Pollution; Such obscene Villains to become our Lords? What! shall we turn a Province to their Power? Who wou'd depend on Affrick for her smiles, That looks upon the fair-fac'd Italy? Can you consent, that she shou'd fall at last; A sober Matron, and unsully'd yet, With all her Graces, to the swarthy spoil Of hot Numidians, and lust-burnt Moors? Pac. We'll hear no more. Perolla, if thou art a Son of mine, Leave him, and follow me. Forward, my Lords. Mag. I have done with Hannibal. And now, Pacuvius, a word to thee. Per. I know my Duty here, and will withdraw From what I fear, a Father's Infamy. [Exit. Pac. This you must answer. Mag. To the Gods, and Men, I'le answer it; wou'd thou cou'dst do as much, For what thou hast done. Pac. I have serv'd the Common-wealth— Mag. Thou hast served thy self. Pac. And 'tis thy Envy rails. Mag. O! that there was no juster cause to speak! But sure there's not so reprobate a Wretch, To envy thee the ruin of thy Country. Pac. The ruin of thy peevishness and pride. Mag. That Fame unenvi'd shall be wholly thine. Thou canst not as a free-born Citizen, But understand, that true prosperity Lives in a common share of liberty: Not in the plunder of our Neighbours rights. Pac. Who has invaded 'em? Mag. Thou wouldst be first: And would thou hadst been so, in dignity Of honest deeds: but that was not enough. Pac. I find I am arraign'd: What was there more? Mag. Thou hast long practised on the Government: Poys'ning its wholesome Constitution, By lawless, bold experiments of power. And now they are broke out in Tyranny, To infect the health and life of Liberty. Pac. Because I have appear'd the peoples friend. Mag. Thou did'st betray the people to themselves, By taking off their safe restraining Laws: And then the Senate to the Peoples rage: That by the credit of redeeming both, Thou might'st betray Us all to Hanibal. Pac. 'Tis very well; go on; let him go on. Mag. What is the puny part that thou must act In this poor Farce of thy Ambition? What will it end in? O! thou would'st be fear'd, Rather than lov'd; thou shalt be hated too; And then what comes of thee? Who can be happy On such conditions of an anxious Life; That ev'n his Murd'rer shall not only 'scape Unpunisht, but shall be rewarded too? All good Men will combine against thy life: Tho this may want design to lay the Plot; A second, Courage to attempt the Deed; Another want an Opportunity; All will consent, and wish to have it done. It is enough for gallant Minds to know How honourable in the enterprize, How grateful in the general benefit, How glorious in the Renown and Fame, It is to kill a Tyrant. Hannibal, Immur'd in walls of Steel, cannot be safe. Pac. O! he'll take care to save himself from you. Mag. Where then can'st thou from Justice hide thy head? Pac. The Laws are living still, to punish such Licentious tongues. Mag. By Death, or Banishment? Say which, thou Tyrant; which do'st thou pronounce? Death drives us from the fellowship of mankind: But Banishment from only such as thee. Before I take my Journey, I prefer These two Petitions to the immortal Gods: The First, That I may leave my Country free: The next, Pacuvius, thou wilt joyn me in: And we will bind all our posterity In the strong Charm, as guilty of this Vow: That all that does belong to thee, and me, Our Children, Kindred, Family, and Name, May flourish, or decay, may rise, or rot; Be blest, or curst, as thou and I deserve From Capua, and from the Commonwealth. Pac. Thou hast Curst thy self, and so expect thy Fate. Pacuvius goes out with the Senators: Magius remains only with his Clients: Perolla returns to him. Mag. When I was Young, I fought for Capua, And wonnot now desert her, being Old: But all my bravery is in my Tongue, I can but talk, and that unminded too. Per. I fear you'll find you've done and said too much. Enter An Officer. Off. Stand, Decius Magius— Mag. Well, I am the Man. Off. I come from Hannibal, to summon you to appear before him. Mag. Tell your Hannibal His Punick Language is not currant here: We do not understand his summoning: He has no right upon a Capuan: I am free-born, and therefore wonnot come. [Exit Officer. Per. O Sir, you are undone. Mag. I think not so. Cli. The Snares are set, you cannot 'scape 'em now. Per. You are encompass'd round with Enemies. Mag. Better encompass'd round with Enemies, Than live to be forsaken of our Friends. Distress is Virtue's Opportunity; We only live, to teach us how to dye. [Exeunt. Favonia enters. Fav. What is this Pomp of Hannibal to me? I cannot lose my self ev'n in the Crowd; His coming wou'd be welcome, cou'd it guard All other Images from entring here. While I am gazing on the Triumph, one, Meaning no harm, cries, This is the reward Of Cannæ's Field: I start, and take the hint, Pursuing it quite through that Scene of Blood, Till it presents at last my Junius slain: My Junius, O! the guilt of that Surprize! Why must I harbour in my Bosom Thoughts Thus to surprize me to my sin and shame? I shall betray my self in Company, Therefore most fit for me to stay at home. Oh! let the steps of Youth be cautious, How they advance into a dangerous World; Our Duty only can conduct us safe: Our Passions are Seducers: but of all, The strongest, Love: he first approaches us, In childish play, wantoning in our Walks, If heedlesly we wander after him, As he will pick out all the dancing way, We're lost, and hardly to return agen; We shou'd take warning, he is painted blind, To show us, if we fondly follow him, The Precipices we may fall into. Therefore let Virtue take him by the hand, Directed so, he leads to certain joy. [Exit. Citizens enter. 3 Cit. Is there no more to be seen? is the Shew over already? Is this all? 1 Cit. All, Why, what did you expect? 3 Cit. Expect, marry, I expected. 2 Cit. You saw Hannibal, did you not? 3 Cit. Yes, yes, I saw Hannibal: But, what? I thought he had been half as big as one of his Elephants: Your Heroes, I find, are little more than other Men, when you come near to examine 'em. 1 Cit. But did you mind his looks? 2 Cit. How terrible he lookt with that one Eye! 3 Cit. Very terrible indeed. 1 Cit. I stood by him a good while, and heard all that he said to the Senate when they met him. 2 Cit. And what, what did he say? 1 Cit. Why, he began very civilly, that's the truth on't, and thankt us for preferring his Friendship before our Alliance with the Romans. 2 Cit. And what more? 1 Cit. Why, he assur'd us, that Capua should, in a little time, be the Capital City of Italy. 3 Cit. Ay, marry Sirs. 1 Cit. And that the Romans themselves, as well as other People, shou'd do Homage to us, and fall under our Government. 2 Cit. Nay, Pacuvius told us as much; that when the War was at an end, and Hannibal the Conqueror, he wou'd carry back his Forces into Afric, and leave us the Empire of Italy. We shall all be Great Men. 1 Cit. But I did not so well like the end of his Speech. 2 Cit. How so? 1 Cit. 'Twas all against Decius Magius: and truly he came to plain speaking at last, and told 'em roundly, He expected they shou'd deliver him into his Power. 2 Cit. And what said the Senators? 1 Cit. Why truly, not much to the purpose at that time: Some said Magius did not deserve to be so us'd neither; others, That such a beginning would have an ill end; but they agreed at last to deny nothing to Hannibal, and so gave the old Man up to his mercy. 2 Cit. See where he comes. 3 Cit. O what a Sight is here? 1 Cit. A Rope about his Neck, and bound in Chains. 2 Cit. A Carthaginian Guard upon him too. An Officer enters with a Guard of Carthaginians before and behind Magius, chain'd with a Rope about his Neck, and led along by a Lictor. Offi. Have your Eyes every way upon the Crowd; If any man but seems to pity him, [To the Guards. Secure him as an Enemy to the State. Mag. You see, my Countrymen, the liberty You have brought home at last for you, and yours, Here, in the Forum, in the barefac'd Sun, You see a Citizen of Capua, Second to none in Name and Dignity, Torn from his Friends, and forc'd in Chains to death; Go meet your Hannibal, crowd all your Streets; Dress up your Houses, and your Images, And put on all the City's Finery, To consecrate this Day a Festival Of Barbarous Triumph over you and me. Offi. I'll spoil your speech-making; drag him along. [Exeunt, The Lictor, dragging Magius off the Stage. 1 Cit. O! piteous Spectacle. 3 Cit. Piteous indeed, 1 Cit. This is the setting out of Slavery. 2 Cit. 'Tis well if it goes no farther: Not allow us to pity our Fellow Citizens! 3 Cit. Ay, did you mark that? 2 Cit. They begin to shew themselves already. 1 Cit. In Colours I don't like: We may repent too late what we have done. Enter more Citizens to 'em. 4 Cit. O you have lost the best of the Shew, the sight of the Prisoners, and the Bushel of Gold-Rings. 1 Cit. What! there were so many Roman Knights kill'd, and taken at Cannæ, that their several Rings, in a heap together, fill'd a Bushel. 4 Cit. So they say, indeed. 1 Cit. Why, then their Bushel lies out of all measure, in my opinion. 4 Cit. The three hundred Knights that were deliver'd to us, wou'd have been worth your seeing; gallant Fellows indeed, and wounded most of 'em. 2 Cit. Some body said, That Junius was found among the Prisoners. 4 Cit. Yes, yes, Junius, our Countryman was among 'em; he was said to be kill'd at Cannæ, but he's alive again, and in a way to do very well. 1 Cit. He's a Prisoner, you say. 4 Cit. No, his old Friend Virginius, upon the merit of his violence, and the credit of his Father Pacuvius, Has made an interest with Hannibal, And, they say, has got him his liberty. 2 Cit. All in good time: but Decius Magius, Let's follow all, to know what comes of him. [Exeunt. Enter Virginius and Junius with an Officer, and Guard. Vir. O Junius! how art thou restor'd to life! And I by miracle to happiness! For tho the bounteous Gods have blest my Fate With all the good things, else, of this great World; Yet wanting thee, wanting my other self, I could not be entire to my content, Not absolute, nor perfect in my joy. But they have brought thee back to me again, And through such 'mazing paths of Providence, We cannot trace, and only can admire. Thus thy good fortune rises from the bad. Hadst thou not been at Cannæ, taken there; Had we not leagu'd our State with Hannibal; Thou had'st not been among the Prisoners, The Roman Knights, to be deliver'd here: Thou had'st not seen thy Country, City, Friends; Nor should I had the interest and power With Hannibal, to gain thy liberty. Jun. I wonnot be oblig'd, for any thing, I do not understand a benefit. I'm Pris'ner of an honourable War; And do despise my Freedom, but on terms As brave and honest, as I parted with it: Such terms I must despair of finding here. Vir. We do invite you to an equal share Of all the advantages of Government, Of Place, and Power, with us in Capua. Jun. Therefore I do refuse my liberty. Vir. You wonnot sure refuse it from a Friend. Jun. I have no Friend, nor I pretend to none. Vir. You have been mine, and you have thought me yours. Jun. That was in our young days; when every thing Was swallow'd, and went credulously down. Our pleasures hurrying on in the same course, When we pursu'd 'em with the same desires, With the same stretch, and eagerness of Youth: Our manners too in every thing ally'd; Then we were Friends for our convenience. But when the business of the World comes on, Justling between ambitious interests, Tis then, in the great voyage of our Life, As if our Vessels struck upon a Rock, Each shifts a several way to 'scape the wreck, And sink, or swim, my Friend; nay, plunge him down, So by his ruin, I get safe to shore. Vir. It never can be so between us two. I have no ambition, have no interest, That Friendship can suspect, or split upon. Friendship is riches, power, all, to me. Friendship's another Element of life: Water and Fire not of more general use, To the support and comfort of the World; Than Friendship to the being of my Joy. I would do every thing to serve a Friend. Jun. And I would serve a Friend in honest things: I do pretend no farther. You, and I, You see, have very different sentiments; Therefore unlikely to continue Friends. If from our former Brotherhood of Love, You do suspect I may have any claim, Against her interest, that should have it all, Here I renounce it, I resign it here. And now let's heartily shake hands, and part; To your high Fortune, You; I to my Fate. Vir. My Fortune and your Fate shall be but one. Jun. They are impossible to reconcile: You happy, I am born to be a Wretch: You free, and I condemn'd to be a Slave. O! had I fal'n with Honour in the Field, How many miseries had ended there! Death had secured me then from being led In Triumph here, over my Country's Shame. I hate your Hannibal, I hate your Cause: And now can only be a Friend to Rome. And if I ever come at Liberty, It shall be but to strike against you all. Offi. You hear him, he is not to be reclaim'd. Vir. This is the present sense of suffering; The grief of unheal'd Wounds: all will be well. Offi. You cannot trust him with his liberty. Vir. With my own life I will. Jun. Have you resolv'd About the trifle of disposing me? Vir. My House your Prison, I must be your Guard. Jun. With your own hands you set it then on fire. Offi. He has warn'd you, and the consequence be yours. [Exeunt Junius following Virginius. SCENE, Virginius's House. Favonia enters, a Woman following. Fav. I'le hear no more: when next thou speak'st to me, Let blood, and death, and ruin be the Theme. Talk of the Massacres of Families, Plunder of Cities, and whole Countries waste. A private mischief is not worth the news. Tell me that all the dire Calamities Of raging War, chain'd up in discipline, Are now broke loose, trooping in horrid march, To fright the World, the brood of Cerberus, And worry all, like the black-guard of Hell. That Lust and Rapine do divide the Spoil: That Giant Murder does bestride our Streets, Stalking in state, and wading deep in Blood. My Father Butcher'd, weltring in his Gore: A Dagger in the Throat of my dear Child: And thou shalt be as welcome then as now. [Exit Woman. That Capua is in Universal Blaze; All, all the winds of Heaven driving this way, And nothing but my Tears to quench the Flame. —Junius alive! ev'n that would give me Death. In Capua too! that brings it nearer still. In the same house! that stabs the Dagger home: It hurries me to Execution, And Execution too upon the Rack: Let me be out of pain, before he comes. What corner shall I find to hide this head in? Where is that Dungeon-darkness that can blind The eye of Jealousie? my Husband comes To draw me to the hateful Light again, To drag me to the tryal of my truth. What can I plead? O guilty, guilty Wretch! There is no courage, but in Innocence: No constancy, but in an honest cause. Thy Conscience is a thousand witnesses: And Junius, the chief Accessary; he Stands out against thee, and confesses all. I'le hear no more: pronounce my sentence quick, Let it be Death, to end me any way. [Exit. Enter Virginius and Junius. Vir. I need not tell you, you command all here, And that you have your Liberty entire. Ha! Junius! why that paleness on thy face? Thy alter'd looks speak thy condition, Thou art not well. Jun. Indeed I am not well. Vir. Expence of Spirits, and the loss of Blood. With needful care they will recruit again. Rest on my arm, and let me lead you in. SCENE Changes to Favonia's Appartment. [Favonia leaning on her hand in a Chair. Virginius leading Junius into the Room. Vir. Favonia— Fav. Ha! who calls? Jun. I can no more: I must end here, [Faints at the sight of Favonia, She Shrieks at sight of Him. Fav. Ha! Vir. Fall into these Arms, They never will refuse to bear thee up. Favonia, call for help; he comes again; Stay; lend your hand; soft, gently, set him down. [In the Chair She rises out of. How is it now? Jun. Conofunded in my shame, That my infirmity should here intrude. Your pardon, Madam, will recover me. Vir. Rally your routed spirits to your aid, Rest will compose and bring 'em back again. I cannot stay with you, but will return To cheer, to comfort you, and to renew The past endearments of our former Friendship. I will provide you Balm for all your Wounds: My Wife her self, your kind Physician, Will wait upon you, till I come again. [Exit. Favonia, and Junius. Jun. I'm hunted to the brink of the Abyss: Plunge in I must, and to the bottom now. But first upon my Knees let me fall down. Trembling, and aw'd, and fearful of your Frown, Bespeaking pardon, if I wildly should, In questioning the Gods upon my Fate, Say any thing towards disturbing you. Fav. O rise, I must not hear you on your Knees. Jun. I'm blest, that you will hear me any way. But O! the Accent of my Voice is chang'd: You cannot know it now in misery. There was a time, in the gay Spring of Life, When every Note was as the mounting Lark's Merry, and cheerful, to salute the Morn; When all the day was made of Melody. But it is past, that day is spent, and done, And it has long been night, long night with me. I have been happier, you have known me so. Fav. Alas! there is no Fortune perfect here. Jun. Indeed I find it: When I enter'd first Into the List of this contending World, I promis'd fair for a more prosperous course: The Favourite of Fortune, and the Friend, To perfect all, of my Virginius: We liv'd the envy of our Capuan Youth, The most aspiring to the Glorious Fame Of Friendship, only imitated us. So blest you found us. Fav. Would to all the Gods, I ne're had come between you, to divide, To part such Friends. Jun. O! had we parted there: He to the rich possession of your Charms; I to a poorer Fortune in my Love; Yet rich enough, and happy in content, All had been well: But he would have me home. Fav. O! I remember his impatience. Jun. To be a Witness of his happiness. And so I was. I hear'd him every day Transported in the Riot of the Theme; Full of the ravishing Discoveries He hourly made in that blest Land of Love: The ever rising Springs of flowing Joy; The hoarded Mines of treasures, yet unborn: With such a rapture of variety Of Pleasures that were ever growing there. It was not safe to hear, I found it so. Fav. O Curs'd effect of foolish Vanity! Jun. What was it to approach then, to behold, And face to face examine and compare The Copied Beauties with the Original? O! they were faint, and the description cold, Heavy and dead, to the inspiring Life: And what I thought Extravagance before, Prov'd easie to the Wonders I saw there. Fav. What will this end in? Jun. Can we resolve to gaze upon the Sun With steady Eyes? soon blinded by that Pride I lost my way; and found my self too late, Born down the torrent of a Passion, That always ended in a Sea of Woe: I plainly saw Ruin attend my Steps; Therefore resolv'd to lead 'em far away, Where they might never come to trouble you. But O! it was with all the violence Of Pangs, in Death, that I at last resolv'd, And yielded to that only Remedy: A Remedy worse than the worst of Deaths To fly the Place, where I must die for Love, Or live a Traitor to my Friend and Fame. Fav. What have you said? Jun. If I have said too much, Believe, I rather had in silence dy'd, Than to have spoke at all: This was the fate I labour'd to avoid. But who can shun His Destiny? it follows every where: Capua, or Rome, or Cannæ, still the same. I would have welcom'd it, that fatal day; But there it lost me in the Crowd of Death. This was the place of Execution; And it has caught, and seiz'd, and bound me here: I'm on the Rack: What I discover now, Is only the expression of my Pain, Wrung from my heart, long overcharg'd, and full, Which else should burst with its Convulsive throws, Rather than ease its Labour by a Groan, A trembling Sigh, that might offend your Ear. Fav. O Junius! whither are you going? hold. Jun. A little farther, and I shall arrive At my long home, the Goal of my Despair. To ask your Pardon, wou'd repeat my Fault: To ask your Pity, were to draw you in, By steps of mercy, to a tenderness, Criminal, and guilty, to reprieve a Wretch, Who, for the Common Peace, and yours, must die. There is no Ward against such Blows as these; They stagger me, and I at last must fall. Since I am doom'd to be a Sacrifice Of fatal friendship, and of hopeless love. Here let me fall, I wou'd be offer'd here; [Falls at her Feet, she breaks his Fall, and kneels by him to recover him. Allow me dying to confess my Love In my last Sigh, and at your feet expire. Fav. 'Tis I am bound, and torn upon the Rack! I cannot bear it, Junius, Junius: Look up, and live, and I'll confess enough For you, and for my self, all that I know, all that I ever heard of wretchedness; What you have undergone what I have felt; What I now feel from this tormenting Love. Where am I going? help there—O he comes Again to life—fly, fly to my relief. Women enter, run to assist Junius, and lead him off. Use all your Arts, his weakness to restore; My cure must be, never to see him more. [Exit at another Door. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A Garden. Enter Pacuvius and Perolla. Pac. I've watch't thee with a careful Parents eye, Follow'd through all the motions of thy Soul And cannot find it, therefore have withdrawn, To give thee place, and opportunity. Per. And therefore have I follow'd you, my Lord, To tell you what it is I labour with. Pac. 'Tis mighty sure, when the great Hannibal Not only has forgiv'n, but honour'd thee, At his high Table, bidding thee his Guest, That can disgrace his Invitation, Poyson his Feast, and in a general Mirth, Make sad the brow of Youth with discontent. Per. 'Tis a design to raise my Countries Fame. Pac. Thy Countries Fame! Per. You see this Dagger here, A little instrument for so great a work, But well employ'd, and gallantly struck home. Pac. Struck home! Per. Into the heart of Hannibal, Wou'd yet attone our infamous revolt. Pac. O Jupiter! thou great deliverer! Per. I have resolv'd to make our peace with Rome, And seal it with this Carthaginian's Blood. 'Tis fit that you should know what I intend: If you approve the deed, then see it done; If not, take this occasion, and retire. Pac. By all the bonds of Duty, and of Love, That tye a Son and Father's hearts in one, I beg, implore, conjure thee to desist: Let me arrest thee in this horrid course, That leads through all the steps of infamy, Into the gulf of sure Perdition. Per. I think not so. Pac. But now, before the Altars of the Gods, We interchang'd our Souls, and plighted Faith, With right-hands joyn'd, in solemn, holy league Of Sacred Trust: and was there nothing meant By these good rites of hospitality, More than, when we had feasted, drank, and laught; To get a nearer opportunity To perpetrate the foulest act of shame, And Stab our Entertainer? Per. How my Lord! Our Entertainer? you compell'd me here. Pac. Your Benefactor; he has sav'd your life. Per. So is the Robber, that but takes my goods: And shall I thank him for not doing more? Pac. If there is nothing Sacred; if you think Religion, Faith, and Piety, restraints But for the weak, then let loose all the Reins. Yet when you undertake a Villany, Act like a Man, not rashly throw away Honour and life in the mad enterprize. Per. My life I have devoted to my Cause, And Honour must attend it, when it goes. Pac. What! would you singly strike at Hannibal? Where is the circle of his Officers? His waiting Slaves, and his attending Guards? The many eyes that only wake for him? The many hands always in arms for him? All blind, and dead? are they confounded all? Can you alone undaunted stand against Those looks of Terror, which arm'd Legions Have trembled at, and Rome could not sustain? Per. I can surprize him in his riots here. Pac. O, no, my Son, hee's not to be surprized. There is an awful guard of Majesty About his Person, that denies approach: A Majesty of glorious Actions, Of famous Wars, and bloody Battels gain'd, That are his Sword and Buckler every where. They charge around him, like Numidian Spears, To terrify and keep off all surprize. Trebie, and Thrasimene, and Cannæ, all Shelter him with the Laurels of their Fields. The mighty Ghost of great Æmilius, That waits him, as his guardian Genius now, Would wish to die again, a death of shame, To see a Boy attempt his Conqueror. But grant you could surprize him, and his guards: Yet I am there, what will you do with me? I am his Fortress, I am his Defence. Will you pursue him through a Father's Life? If you will Stab him, Stab him then through me. My breast oppos'd, first you must reach my Heart, Before your Dagger can arrive at him. Per. O, Sir, your words have struck a Dagger here. Pac. Is then the thirst of thy revenge so hot, Not to be slackt, but with a Father's Blood? Per. I'le pour out mine to quench your kindled Rage. Pac. Let me deter thee here, rather than go To throw away thy self, and ruin me. O let my Prayers prosper, and prevail With thee, as for thee they prevail'd to day. Per. I must deny you nothing: but you have Undone your Self, your Country, and your Son. You have commanded me, and I will pay That piety to you my Country claims. O my dear Country! this was my last hope, To have restored thee to thy Self and Rome. I had prepar'd this Dagger in thy Cause: But since my Father wrests it from my Hand; I can no more, but with my Grief retire, And in the Crowd expect the common Fate. [Exit. Virginius enters to Pacuvius. Vir. You have withdrawn your self in a bad time. We wanted you within: the Publick has Put on a different face from what it had: But Smile, or Frown, we cannot mend it now. Pac. Pray, what's the matter? Vir. Why, the question rose Upon the raking in the Tarentines. Pac. O, I was by, when their Ambassadors Were introduced, and had their Audience. Their business was welcom'd, and well receiv'd, But not requiring: haste, soon laid aside, And civily dismist, while I was there. Vir. It was so, and the Revellings went on. But then, from all the quarters of the Town, We were allarmed by clamorous complaints, Of every kind, against the Soldiers. Women, and Wine, we knew, of right were theirs, But in a natural, and manly use, Not to break through, or over-leap the bounds Of Government, by brutal violence. But when they came, without distinction, To seize on all, proceeding so to Blood, To Plunder, Murder, and to Ravishment, 'Twas high time to complain. Pac. High time indeed. Vir. Some call'd on you, others petition'd me: And every Client to his Patron ran, To save him, or redress his injuries. Pac. What follow'd then? Vir. Maherbal standing by, The Carthaginian General of the Horse, With his blunt honesty, told Hannibal, That from the Soldiers Luxury, he foresaw Capua would prove to him and his affairs, Fatal, as ever Cannæ did to Rome. Pac. Ha! that was home. Vir. Hannibal rouz'd at that, And gave his orders for a speedy March: But not so much, on what Maherbal said, It is believ'd, as on some News from Rome. Pac. We never wish'd him to continue here. Vir. But what should be the News that has so soon Alter'd his Measures? Pac. O, no matter what Can come from Rome; he has serv'd the present turn, And we can serve our selves against the next: We must be near him, while he stays with us. [Exeunt. SCENE Virginius's House. Enter Junius. Jun. It was her hand that rais'd me from the Grave; It was her Mercy that repriev'd my Fate: She meant it in a kind Compassion, Tho it had been the tendrest Charity, To let the rigor of the Sentence pass Upon my Life, and put me out of pain. I am redeem'd from the arrest of Death, To pine, and languish in a wretched Life. Is there no Remedy; Want will be heard, And answer'd too; I could turn Begger here: When once it comes to the extremity To take, or starve, there is no more a right Of Property; all things lie common then In Nature's Field; from Heav'n to Hell is ours, For our support, to compass any way. What hinders then but I may be reliev'd? I have discharg'd my self from all the Bonds Of friendship, duty, that encumber'd me; And I am left at large, and free to take All opportunities that can assist To make me—What? a Villain Am I free? Discharg'd of all my obligations? Why am I here, plac'd as another Lord Over this Family, and not a friend? Is then the Trust and Confidence repos'd In me, and my fidelity, no Bond? These are State Morals; but adversity Has ever been an evil Counsellor; And always will be so: I'll hear no more. I have nothing left me but my honesty, To write my Epitaph, and grace my Tomb: Thither I'm going, O Favonia! stay, I see you shun me, let me only take A parting look, I wonnot dare to speak, If I shou'd sigh, it is my last adieu. [Exit. SCENE the Forum. Enter three or four Citizens of the better sort. 1 Cit. Are these our Friends? what cou'd they have done worse by us, if they had been our Enemies? 2 Cit. If our City had been taken by Storm, they could but have ravish'd our Wives and Daughters. 3 Cit. And put us to the Sword; you forget that Man. 2 Cit. No, we were reserv'd for a worse Punishment, to stand by, and look on, as scandalous Witnesses of our infamy and disgrace. 1 Cit. There's nothing free from their insolence and outrage. 2 Cit. Every place prophan'd by their Rioting and Drunkenness. 1 Cit. They have invaded every thing that's dear to us. 2 Cit. No Property in any thing. 3 Cit. Especially the Petticoat; nay, it has been very bad indeed; but 'twill mend now, they are marcht away to the Tarentines; and Tarentum take 'em, I say. 1 Cit. Hannibal is march'd indeed with his Army, but has left a Garison behind him; What does he mean by that? 2 Cit. To protect us against the Romans. 1 Cit. The Romans! why, we have been told all along there was no danger of them. 2 Cit. I wish we may find it so. 1 Cit. There's no believing any thing now a-days; not a Syllable of truth in the Mouth of Report, for an honest Man to walk by. 2 Cit. 'Tis all Party, and serving a turn. 1 Cit. There was no News currant a great while, but the Distress of the Romans, the Misery they were brought to, and the utter impossibility of ever appearing in arms agen; that was all the reason we had for deserting our old friends. 2 Cit. Now that turn's serv'd, and not so much care taken to stifle Intelligence; we hear of nothing but their Industry and Virtue; the Preparations and Power of the Romans: I am credibly informed they have a Consular Army in the Field, and in a condition to try their fortune again with Hannibal, if he pleases. 1 Cit. He may thank himself, if they should beat him now. 2 Cit. If he had march'd directly to Rome from Cannæ, as he was advis'd. 1 Cit. But he stay'd there playing the Merchant, and selling his Prisoners. 2 Cit. Which provoked Maherbal to tell him, That he knew how to conquer, better than to use his Victory. 3 Cit. If the Romans are so strong, what may become of us then? 2 Cit. Nay, we have pull'd our old Houses upon our Heads, and may be buried in the Ruins, for ought we know. 1 Cit. We have deserv'd as ill as we can of 'em. 2 Cit. And have nothing to pray the Gods, but that they may never have it in their Power to reward us to our Deserts. Omn. That's all we have to trust to. [Exeunt. Enter Pacuvius and Virginius. Vir. Is't possible! he cannot be so base, forgetful, so ungrateful to his Friends. Pac. Contain your self, at least here in the Street; let us not be the first in our complaints, who were the forwardest— Vir. And we are paid most richly for our pains. Pac. I will come home To you, and there we will enlarge our hearts— Vir. In spight of all his Guards, and speak bold Truths: I shall expect you with impatience. [Exit. Pac. Bold Truths! they may return upon our selves: For if I speak Truth boldly, as it is, I cannot be surpriz'd, that Hannibal Should leave a Garison, should not trust me With full command, which I had just before Abus'd, betray'd, and given up to him: To him, I mean to my Ambition: This little stand of Fortune gives me time To look about, and see what I have done. The many violent steps that I have made To bring me here, to my untimely fall, It may be too, when Thrasimene was fought, Being chief Magistrate of Capua, Had Hannibal marcht this way, I had design'd The Senate's slaughter, to deliver up The City so. I was prevented then: But now have done it—not so bloodily. What was the Romans murder in our Baths, Was not that Bloody, and set on by me? I had forgot: 'tis dangerous to awake A guilty Memory. Decius Magius too Stands out to accuse me—but he's still alive. O I remember all his Curses now: May they be blown about, and lost in Air; Not shed their Venom upon me and mine. [Exit. SCENE Changes to Virginius's House. Enter Junius. Jun. All close, and silent! as in depth of Night Wrapt up in darkness! in the inner room I spy a winking Lamp, that weakly strikes The ambient Air, scarce kindling into Light: That, seeble as it is, shall be my guide. There I shall find her in her pomp of Grief. Dare I invade her sacred solitude? My Heart sinks in me, and my trembling knees Knock, and forsake me, when I wou'd go on; Warning me not to touch forbidden ground. Forbidden! so are all good things to me. Nothing to hope, I nothing have to fear. (Exit. SCENE changes, and shows Favonia asleep on a Couch in an undress. Junius returns. Jun. She consecrates the Place, where e're She is, With reverence: We enter Temples so. Where are the Terrors, that shou'd keep me back? Her frowns, the greatest, are disarm'd in sleep. O may the softest down of sweet repose Receive thee gently on the Bed of Peace, And fold thee close in the kind arms of rest: That undisturb'd, this Opportunity May now be mine, to feed my famisht Eyes. The sickning light is envious, and grows pale, With looking on her: 'tis a sight indeed For the high mounted Sun, in all his Pride, To stop, and wonder at—let me fix here— Stretch wide the Gates of sight to take her in, In the full triumph of her conquering charms. My eager Eyes devour her Beauties up, Insatiable, and hungring still for more. O! the rich Glutton, that enjoys this store! Nothing to spare from superfluity, To feed my wants, my Feaver burns me up, O! let me quench it at this healing Spring. The Spring is sacred; a Divinity Protects the place; thrice happy, happy, he Who may plunge in, and bathe, and wanton there. But I may taste the coolness of the stream. And I will drink the Cordial of a kiss, From this dear hand, reach'd out to comfort me. (kneels, and kisses her hand. She wakes! Virginius and Pacuvius at the Door entring. What noise! I may retire unseen. (Exit. Vir. A Man here with my Wife! O give me way (Breaks from Pacuvius. Fav. Who's there? my Lord? Vir. Where is the Villain? where? (Runs after Junius. Fav. O! where indeed? my Father! on my knees Let me protest, and swear my Innocence. I am betray'd, and lost. Pac. Thou art indeed. (Virginius returns. Vir. This was contriv'd, and lay'd for his escape: And this Apartment fitted, and prepar'd To be the Scene of their adulterous Lust. Where is there such another Wretch on earth? Ruin'd, undone in every interest, Betray'd, and ruin'd in my dearest trust! But I will be the Executioner Of my just rage, and here begin revenge— Pac. Strike home, it is the Sword of Justice now. Vir. Have you condemn'd her? Pac. I applaud the deed. (She opens her arms. Vir. I wonnot kill thee in thy Fathers sight. That were to act a murder upon him. Here, take her, Sir, I give her up to you. Your Houses honour is engag'd with mine. Do with her what is fit for you, and me. You are her Judge, condemn, or set her free. (Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Forum. Junius with Citizens. Jun. Let Capua sink under the Rods of Rome: Her Axes hew your Branches to the stock, The Lifeless trunk, never to sprout agen. The Gods appointment always is the best, But every way your ruine will be just. 1. Cit. If all our Nobles are of your mind, what must become of the City in a little time? Jun. It must become the injur'd Roman's spoil, At the best, that, and you their faithless Slaves, As you deserve, unworthy to be Friends. Now, now the day of your account draws on. The Roman Consuls come as Ministers Of Wrath, and Terror to this guilty Town, Arm'd with the kindled Justice of the Gods Against your Crimes, with their avenging Bolts From Heav'n, and the devouring Flames of Hell, To burn, destroy, and ruine you, and yours. They have invested you with Fire, and Sword. Famine, and Pestilence will follow soon In the starv'd rear, to seize, and fasten on Those Wretches, who just scape the stroke of War. You have variety of Misery Before you, in this siege, to pick, and chuse What Death you please, but think not to escape. Your Hannibal has left you, with the Gods, And all good Men, to sure perdition. (Exit. 2. Cit. A sorry comforter— 1. Cit. Of tother side; no friend of ours; no matter what he says. He wishes it were worse, if possible. 3. Cit. Nay, 'tis ev'n bad enough; and how 'twill be better I don't know. 2. Cit. We're in a miserable condition, that's the truth on't, and which way to apply our selves for a remedy— 1. Cit. Ay, that's the way, if we cou'd hit on't. 2. Cit. Let's to the Forum, There we shall find our fellow Citizens, 1. Cit. We'll joyn with them, for something must be done. (exeunt. Junius Returns. Jun. What is't to me, my Country, Capua? Who does maintain, or who deserts her Cause? Favonia is the Province of my Care. And her I have deserted, basely left, How! basely! nay, abandon'd to the Rage, It may be, of a jealous Husband too. Ha! whether am I hurry'd by my Fears? Had I foreseen but half the Accidents, That threaten now, what wou'd I not have done? I wou'd have snach'd her from his cruel Hands. And may do still. I will declare my Love, Clear her suspected Honour to the World, Or justifie my Passion by Revenge. (Exit. SCENE changes to Pacuvius's House. Enter Pacuvius and Servant. Pac. Let him dispose of her, as he thinks best: It was a Task unnaturally impos'd, And therefore willingly I lay it down. Besides there is a publick Conflict here, Within this Breast, admits not private Cares. Say, have you sent to Vibius Virius, And Marius Blosius? Ser. As you order'd, Sir. Pac. And what? Ser. They will come home to you. Pac. 'Tis well. Let no body disturb me, till they come. They sent no News? Ser. There's none worth sending, Sir. Pac. Worth sending! true, 'twill come it self too soon. But we may boldly hear what we must feel. 'Tis natural to enquire how the World goes— Ser. Towards an end with us, 'tis to be fear'd, And Capua, the Expedition is Incredible, that carries on the Seige. Pac. We often ask, in Cases of Despair, When we are sure the Answer cannot please. Ser. Hannibal try'd to raise it, but in vain: And now 'tis said that he is march'd to Rome: That way to draw the Consuls from our Walls, To save their City, and defend themselves. Pac. Leave me, and bring in what Reports you hear. (Exit the Servant. We cannot answer for unborn Events: The Gods have plac'd 'em in the Hands of Fate, To Shape, and Fashion for their high Decrees; At their appointed time, to bring 'em forth, To baffle human Wit, and Industry. Else in the Course of Probability; And as Appearances presented things, Rome was to fall, and Capua was to rise. But Fate, it seems, has otherwise ordain'd. There is a secret Power within the Scene That works unseen, and makes so quick a oh I cannot stand the Taunts of bad Success, And therefore wonnot meet 'em in the crow I have hitherto been on the winning side. We have another Game of Fortune now, And I will loose as little as I can. I cannot make the Figure that I wou'd, But need not make a bad one; that's in me; If it grows worse, I know my Remedy. (Exit. SCENE changes to the Forum. A crowd of Citizens. 3. Cit. No Tidings to comfort us? 4. Cit. Sad Times, sad Times, and running on to be worse, as fast as they can drive. 2. Cit. Did ever People fall from such a Pinacle of Prosperity, unto such a Gulph of Destruction, in so little a time? 3. Cit. Never, never. 2. Cit. Our Sallys did something at first to hinder their Works, but to no purpose now, they'r beaten back upon every Attempt, and dare not look the Romans in the Face. 3. Cit. There's no peeping upon the Walls. 4. Cit. The Engines play so thick, they'r about your Ears before you'r aware of 'em. 3. Cit. Not a Spade employ'd in the Trenches, but digs a Capuan Grave. 4. Cit. Wee'r in a sad Condition indeed. 1. Cit. There's no Body to Command, but Bostar, and Hanno, the Carthaginians, and how the Capuans obey them, you may believe. 2. Cit. The Garrison fights hard for us, to save themselves; but they'll pay their Quarters before they leave us. 3. Cit. They have brought us into the Crime, and wont forsake us in the Punishment. 1. Cit. Nay, they have done all they can for us with Hannibal. 2. Cit. And for themselves, for they must pay our Scores; but what was that all? 1. Cit. Why, they sent to him, to complain that he had abandon'd the Town, and, as it were, yielded it up himself to the Fury of the Romans; and withall beseeching him, that he wou'd come to their Relief, who were not only Besieg'd, but shut up in the Works, and almost in the Hands of the Enemy, 2. Cit. Upon which he came to look upon his Patients at a distance, shook his Head in despair of our State, and went to Rome for better Advice. 3. Cit. He sent us his Reason for so doing. 2. Cit. But the Consuls are here still, for all his Reason, and the Prætor too; their Armies are not drawn off, as soon as Hannibal march'd out of Capua, the Romans came upon us, you know, as if they had hit the opportunity, they had been aiming at so long; they did not come here to be drawn away by every Motion of the Enemy. 4. Cit. No, no, they wont leave us so. 2. Cit. Therefore my Advice is, either to try what our Despair can do, in making a bold push, or take the Benefit of the Consuls Proclamation. 3. Cit. What's that? What does the Proclamation say? 2. Cit. It offers Life, and liberty to all those that surrender themselves in four and twenty Hours. 3. Cit. Why, ay, why don't we lay hold on the Proclamation? 4. Cit. At least let's stay for an Answer from Hannibal. Some Mauritanians have undertaken, in the Name of Deserters, to get to him thro' the Roman Camp. 2. Cit. And will be wise enough never to come back agen. In the mean time, we stand like Condemn'd Men, with the Halter about our Necks, but no body attempts any thing for himself, or the Publick. 1. Cit. What wou'd you have us do? The chief Citizens have shut themselves up in their Houses, expecting their Ruine, with the Destruction of their Country. 3. Cit. The Nobles have deserted us, and the Care of the Common-wealth. 2. Cit. Why then, in the first place, let us go, and set Decius Magius at Liberty. Omn. Agreed, agreed; 'twas luckily thought upon. 3. Cit. He's a good Man, and a lover of his Country. 4. Cit. And a Lover of the People. 1. Cit. Nay, he never quarrell'd with us, but for our Faults, when we deserv'd it. 3. Cit. If we had been govern'd by him, Friends— 2. Cit. Let us clap him up at the Head of the Government. 3. Cit. And his Enemies in his place. 4. Cit. We can't do better. 1. Cit. And then we'll go about the City to Summon the Senate, and tell the Senators plainly what they must trust to; that unless they assemble immediately to look after the Publick, we'll set their Houses on Fire about their Ears, and begin with them in the Ruin of Capua. 2. Cit. We'll Sacrifice them to their Country, rather then give up our Wives and Children to the Enemy. 3. Cit. And so we'll tell 'em plainly. 4. Cit. There's nothing else to be done. 1. Cit. If we are to be Ruin'd, let it begin at our Betters? 2. Cit. 'Tis time enough for us, when it comes to our turn. And I'll take my turn, tho' it be at the Gallows. 1. Cit. Why, that's well said, there's something to be expected from our honest endeavours. Therefore all hands to Decius Magius. (Exeunt. SCENE Virginius's House. Virginius enters with a Servant. Vir. You know the rest, tell her that I am here. (Exit Servant. SCENE opens and shews Favonia on the Ground. Where are you? on the ground! it does become The present Posture of your fall'n Estate, Fallen from the highest pitch of Happiness, Into the lowest depth of Misery. Yet I will raise you; wou'd I cou'd restore you To the admir'd height, in which you stood, Of Fame, and Virtue; but it cannot be. As well I may refix a new fall'n Star, In his bright Orb, to light the World agen. I come to visit you. Fav. I thank you, Sir. Vir. I durst not trust you in a Father's Hand. Fav. I have no Friend. Vir. O! that the time shou'd come, That you shou'd ever say you have no Friend, When I am near you. Yes, you have a Friend, A Friend you shou'd not have, no more of that. I am to tell you what a Friend you've lost: And then compute your Gains. Fav. I have lost all That ever was of Value to my Peace. Vir. You have destroy'd all that was in your Pow'r: And you well know your Pow'r to ruine me. You've thrown away a Husband, and his Love, That follow'd you, as Nature does her Works; To nurse, and raise you to Perfection. Had all the good things of this Earth been mine, And mine the Pow'r to draw their Spirits off, Into a Quintessence of Happiness, I had bestow'd the precious Draught on you. And in return.— Fav. O I could make you none, To your Deserts. Vir. In barbarous Return, You have reach'd out the Gall of Bitterness To dash my Cup, and poyson all my Joys. I cou'd have sweetned it with my Revenge, Which I restrain'd. I held your Father's Hand, Stretch'd out to take away your guilty Life. For when I heard he had pronounc'd your Death, And Sign'd the Execution, tho' I knew You had deserv'd it of my Wrongs, and Me, I cou'd not hold, but flew to your Relief. And why? Is it because my Nature is Insensible, and cannot feel a Wrong? Stupid, and deadned to the Sense of Shame? Or that I'm noted for my Easiness In finding out Excuses to forgive? And pardon faster than they injure me? Is that the Reason that I rescu'd you? You know me better, no, Favonia, no, 'Twas Pity came into the Place of Rage. But do not therefore think that I am fit, For my Disgrace, because I pitty'd you. Justice her self-Condemns with a Remorse, And pitty's while she strikes, besides I thought, That you, and you, who for so many Years Had liv'd, as Friends, shou'd have a time to part. Fav. O Misery! that I must nothing say In my Defence, to clear my Innocence, Vir. Hold, have a care, no more of Innocence, Or a Defence, if you insist on that, I shall break thro' the Temper I propos'd, And then I cannot say where I shall end. Fav. Well, I have done. Vir. Not but you have an Advocate still here, Within this Breast, and not to be remov'd, That in Defiance of a Cause so foul, So desperate, and so lost, will yet be heard. But then it does pretend but to advise, And warn me to be cautious what I do, Well to consider what I undertake, Pondring to weigh the heavy Consequence, And not revenge my self upon my self. As that's the case, unless I am resolv'd. Never to want what I wou'd throw away. And who can know his Resolution? Who can be sure, that he is well enough Acquainted with the Temper of his Heart. To answer for its Proof and Constancy? To know it's strength sufficient to support So great a Loss, to bear a Loss, like yours? The Loss of all, that ever I held dear. A Loss, to beggar me, and all my Hopes. These were the Thoughts that flew to your Relief, And have preserv'd you for this Interview. Fav. More terrible than Death it self to me. Vir. You cannot think I come to pardon you. No, all that I endeavour, or can gain Upon my Wrongs, is to disarm my Rage. And let it pass among the strange Effects Of that commanding Pow'r, you always had Upon my Heart, that you are yet alive. But I am still contriving my Revenge; Still meditating how to punish you; And I am in a way that pleases me: It satisfies my Justice better too, Than the Atonement of your spotted Blood. (Exit. Fav. There is no Remedy, no way to save My Innocence, but by accusing him, Who always has been dearer than my Life. It must be he, that cou'd pursue me there. If he has scap'd with safety, I am pay'd, Tho' 'tis a heavy loss of Life, and Fame. Virginius returns with a Child in his Hand. Vir. Here is a little Innocent, that comes To Mourn with you: Soon as she can speak plain, She'll tell you, 'tis an undone Mothers Loss Has brought her hither, to be Nurs'd in Tears. Fav. O! may she never know her Mothers Fate. Vir. Nor the Dishonour of her Father, but Inheriting her Parents Infamy, She must grow up with the Disgrace, and Shame. Look on her well. Fav. My Eyes, and Heart are full of her. Vir. Look on her as it were to be the last, The last, last look that you may ever have. Fav. This Object I wou'd wish to close my Eyes. Vir. You must remember how she has been bred, The fondled Darling of our rival Loves. Fav. Who are to strive in fondness of her now? Who to supply a tender Mothers Care? Vir. O! that the Reason of my Love shou'd prove, Shou'd ever prove the reason of my Hate! How have I hung upon the little Lines Of that dear Face, with a fond Father's Joy, To find the Mother there in Minature, By Natures Hand Copy'd in every Look! I pray'd the God's she might resemble you, And now abhor the Likeness I desir'd— I cannot look upon her, but she brings Her Mothers Crimes into my Memory— When you are in your Grave, the sight of her Will raise you from the Dead, to haunt my Peace, To plague, and punish me, take her away. I wonnot throw her out to Beggary, But for your sake will never see her more. Fav. O miserable Woman! must I be The Ruine of my Child! (She snatches up the Child, the Women come about her to take the Child. Vir. Away with her. Why am I not obey'd? Force her away. Fav. O let her stay but for a parting hour— Vir. No, not a Minute, not a Moments stay. Fav. To take a farewel Kiss. Vir. You've seen your last of her. Now she has wound her self about your Heart, Now she has hold of all the Strings of Life, Now tear her thence—that you at last may feel (Forcing the Child from her she falls on the Floor. Some of the Tortures you prepar'd for me. Fav. The God's must give me Patience to support What they inflict, this is a thousand Deaths. Vir. When I can entertain you at this rate, I'll visit you agen, in the mean time You know your Lodging, I must see you in. You'll have sufficient leisure to reflect Upon the Follies that have brought you here. You've made your self unworthy of the World, And therefore never shall appear agen, But live forlorn, immur'd within these Walls. Who's there? (A Servant enters with a Dagger in one Hand, and a Bowl in t'other, and gives 'em to Virginius, who places 'em on a Table by Favonia. I have your Father's Present yet to bring. He sends a Dagger, and a poyson'd Draught, In your Extremity to comfort you. When you are weary of this Slavery: You have that wretched choice to set you free. (The Scene shuts upon Favonia, he goes off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Forum. Pacuvius, Vibius Virius Marius Blosius, with the Senators in their several Parties. 1 Sen. We are met here, and only to be made More certain of inevitable Fate: Each Moment brings us Matter of Despair, And no one to propose a Remedy. Blo. The Mauritanians, who were hir'd, and sent, And, as Deserters, undertook to pass The Roman Camp, and get to Hannibal, Discover'd by the Consuls to be Spies, Fifty in number were condemn'd to be First strip'd, and Scourg'd, then with their Hands cut off, In that most lamentable plight driv'n back To Capua, to let us see the News. 2 Sen. To let us see what we are to expect. 3 Sen. To let us read in bloody Characters The Vengeance that is laid in store for us. 4 Sen. The Spectacle has sunk the People so, They dare no longer think of a Defence, And talk of nothing but Surrendring now. Pac. This Accident has cut our Commerce off, All our Intelligence with Hannibal. We've nothing farther to expect from him. Blo. And the God's know, but little from our selves. Within. Bear back, make way for our Deliverer. Do you not know good Decius Magius. Enter Decius Magius. 1 Sen. O! Decius Magius! you'r a wellcome Man Among us, you were never wanted more. Mag. 'Tis a bad Day for Capua, when a Weak, Old, useless Man comes to be wanted so. But any thing is welcome in Distress. I'm sorry for the Cause that brings me here, Tho' it has brought me back to Liberty, From Dungeon Darkness to the Heavenly Light. 2 Sen. We never were in such a wretched need. Mag. I hear how Matters go with us, all wrong, And fear me, 'tis too late to set 'em right. My Pow'r is very poor, but yet you may Employ it, as you please, for Capua, For I am still devoted to her Cause. 1 Sen. We cannot hope to have the Town reliev'd. 2 Sen. Nor are we able to defend it long. 3 Sen. The Roman Clemency has oft been try'd On desperate Occasions, and been found, When all has fail'd, the only Remedy. 4. Sen. And let us not despair of its effects, Its good effects on us. Blo. What do you mean? 1. Sen. To pacifie the fury of our Fate. 2. Sen. Not to enrage it by opposing it. 3. Sen. But freely give what they have pow'r to take. 1. Sen. We have agreed, the greatest part of Us, To send our Legates to the Consuls Camp, And offer up the Town, to save our lives. 4. Sen. And you are come, good Decius Magius, The fittest Suppliant in your Country's Cause. 1. Sen. You have deserv'd, and you may well pretend An Interest with the Roman Generals. Mag. An Interest against their Interest! There's very little to expect from that. 1. Sen. We will surrender at discretion. Mag. And that is but a wretched Embassie. But if you think it is the only way To do you Service, and you are agreed. 2. Sen. We are agreed there is no other way. Mag. What says Pacuvius? You are yet to speak. Pac. I wou'd ill become my character, to joyn In this advise of supplicating Rome, In our distress, who, may be, was the first To urge her Ruine, by deserting her. But if I were no more obnoxious, No more accountable for our revolt, Than he that acted least, yet I must think, From what we've done to them, and they to us, There is no hope of pardon at their hands. Blo. A Pardon! 'tis a Play-thing for a Child, To still the present fit of frowardness; A Man can never set his heart upon't. Pac. Now, when a Foreign Enemy insults, And Hannibal himself that Enemy, When all things are permitted to the Sword, Brandish'd, and flaming over Italy, At such a time, forgetting Hannibal, And every threatned danger, to send here Both Consuls, with their Armies Consular, Looks as they did intend to make their Wars Only on us, not Carthage more abhorr'd Than Capua, as if they did not come For Fame, or Victory, but for revenge. Mag. It may be so, and that they come to raise A Monument, to warn succeeding times, Never to injure, in whatever State Their Fortune is, the Citizens of Rome. Pac. The very Savages, and fiercest Beasts, Do but approach their Dens, and they will leave Their destin'd Prey, to save their helpless Young. The Romans are more eager yet than they. For not the leaguer of their City Rome, Their Wives, their Children (whose imploring cries, And lamentations almost reach 'em here) Their Altars, Hearths, the Temples of the Gods, The Sepulchers of their great Ancestors. In danger to be violated all By Hannibal, can once remove 'em hence, From the determin'd spoil of Capua. So greedy are they of our Punishment, Of such a burning thirst to drink our Blood. Therefore, for my part, I will seek no aid Out of my self: while I am Master of My liberty, I can take care for one. 1. Sen. You, who have made your selves unworthy of Pardon, and mercy, justly may despair. But we have hopes in Decius Magius. Mag. Alas! 2. Sen. Take the three hundred Roman Knights Along with you, that are our Prisoners. 3. Sen. That was a lucky thought, make all the Friends— Mag. Adversity will find but very few. 3. Sen. What force you can. Mag. And all, I fear, too weak, (Exit with his Party. Pac. You then, who seem to have another sense Of what we owe to the Immortal Gods, And our immortal selves, in these extremes, I do invite you to take part with me, In the kind entertainment of this Night, Which I've prepar'd for many more good Friends. The Wine, and Company I know are good: The Supper chosen well, and elegant: For who can tell but it may be our last. If it so prove; indulge the Genius, Enlarge the Soul, and feast the senses high: We'll sacrifice at last to Liberty. (Exeunt. Enter Virginius and Junius. Vir. O Junius! 'tis unworthy of the Man, Who calls you Friend, so scandalous a Fate. But do not think that I am reconcil'd, Humbled, and tam'd to my dishonour, no. Jun. I know you can't be wanting to your self. Vir. I wanted to acquit my self to you, And therefore I have found you luckily, To go with me— Jun. You may command your Friend. Vir. To be a witness that I treat the Wretch As She deserves from me, and my revenge. (Exeunt Virginius's House. Favonia enters with a Dagger in one hand, and a Bowl in tother. Fav. A Fathers Present to a luckless Child! His sending it, and by a Husbands hands, Shou'd have determin'd me, before this time, In what I have to do, 'tis but to dye. And that I've meditated, study'd long; And often wisht; but yet this Dagger here, This Ruffian Dagger, like a Murderer, That does delight in Blood, looks terrible. There's nothing horrid in this friendly Bowl: And it will do the deed as certainly, And satisfie my angry Fate as well. She drinks, throws the Bowl one way and the Dagger another. 'Tis past; the little argument of Life Is at an end; and Death will soon conclude. This is the fatal period of our Crimes, Ending at last in certain Punishment. And yet my Crimes, methinks, might well have past For my misfortunes, to be pity'd, Rather than punish'd; but I must not tax The justice of the Gods; they have their ends In every thing they do; they have thought fit To judge 'em Crimes, and so to doom 'em here. Perhaps to warn too negligent a World, By my example, how they do engage In little things, that may be dangerous. If there is any profit of my Death, 'Tis well, I do not grudge the benefit; For I begin to find its comfort here. (Laying her self down on the Floor. Enter Virginius, and Junius to Favonia; Junius runs to her assistance. Jun. Extended on the Floor; is this a sight To triumph in? Vir. The Dagger, or the Bowl, Has rescu'd her, and disappointed me. I fear she's almost got out of my reach. (Virginius kneels at her feet, Junius at her head. Jun. She's in the Pangs of Death. Vir. There let her stay, And linger Ages out in Agony, To glut my Eyes, and satiate my revenge. Jun. She's going! O! Favonia! she is gone! (Favonia dyes, Junius weeping over her. Vir. Why let her go, and with her all my Plagues. Jun. I came to be a witness of thy Truth, And Innocence; but shou'd have come before To save thy Life— Vir. Methinks you are too much Concern'd for her. Jun. Begone, and leave me here. Your Title carry'd to the end of life; No farther; you have put an end to that: And now I honestly may set up mine. Vir. What Title? Jun. To revenge her Death on you. Junius starts upon his knees, seizes upon Virginius, they rise in a struggle, Junius draws his Sword upon him. You have involv'd me in this Murder here: And made me an Accomplice of a deed, To damn us both down to the lowest Hell. If you dare justifie it, draw your Sword. Vir. Dare justifie it? Jun. Dare. Vir. You know I dare. Another Man had prov'd my daring too, Before this time. Jun. So every Coward says, Vir. Nay, then 'tis past; this only answers that. (They Fight, both wounded. Jun. 'Tis as it shou'd be: I was not to live. Vir. I cannot long. (Junius falls by Favonia. Jun. Then I have been a Friend Indeed, if I have hasten'd on your Death. For when I have confess'd a few sad Truths, You'll find I only have prevented you From laying violent hands upon your grief, Cursing the light, and falling to despair. Vir. Your words have stuck attention in my heart. Jun. Favonia is most innocent, and wrong'd: And you, and I the only guilty here. Vir. But prove her so, and I shall dye with joy. (Falling at her feet. Jun. In lov'd her, for I may avow it now, And you may thank your self, who were the cause, By bringing me into your Family. I lov'd her with a passion, that no bounds Cou'd circumscribe, no violence cou'd tame, No Council moderate, no Friendship cure. Therefore I went to Rome, resolv'd to breath My sighs in Foreign Air, not to disturb Your Interest, or Favonia's Innocence. I languisht many Years; my Fate thought fit To bring me back; and you wou'd have me home. Vir. In left her with you. Jun. I that conflict, I Confess'd what I had suffer'd for my love: She pity'd me; and I desir'd no more. Vir. Say on, while I have leisure to attend. Jun. The Man you found in her Apartment, was Your wretched Friend: I thought to 'scape unseen. But that poor caution has undone us all. Vir. What was your Business there? Jun. I went to take A parting look, resolv'd to end my griefs, And trouble her no more. Favonia was Ev'n Innocent of my being there. I found her sleeping with her harmless Thoughts: And She but wak'd, as you approach'd the Room, In a surprize, to find her self undone. This Writing I have drawn to vouch for me, In all the circumstances of this tale: And the Gods try me by the Truth it bears. (Dyes. Vir. A solemn adjuration! and no doubt Most heavenly true; and all this is the work Of my own folly; had I been content With that fair portion of felicity, The Gods bestow'd upon me in a Wife; How happy had I been! but I must bring My Friend home to usurp upon her right. And what's the consequence! Ruine, and Death. The approach of Death makes me less sensible. I've lost my Wife, and Friend, and now my self. (Dyes. SCENE Pacuvius House. Pacuvius, Vibius Virius, Marius Blosius, with Seven or Eight Senators rising from a Feast. Pac. Who, who wou'd basely lag behind in life, Only to see how many wretched ways Our Enemies will find out to punish us? 5 Sen. These Eyes shall never be Spectators of My Countries Ruine. Vib. Nor will I behold The ravage, and the havock of our Spoils— 6 Sen. Nor Capua's Honours trampled in the dust— 7 Sen. Nor shining horrid with involving Flames. Blo. Shall our chast Matrons, and our blushing Maids, Our generous Youth, bred up to nobler hopes, Attempted, seiz'd, o'erpow'rd, be tam'd at last, To the insults of all unnatural Lusts? Vib. If there was nothing else to undergo— Blo. You cannot call it living on such terms. Pac. If we agree, that Life wou'd be a load, Not to be Born, with these Indignities: Here is the helping hand to throw it off. (A Servant gives him a Bowl. This Bowl I have reserv'd to crown the Feast. Hannibal carries Poyson in a Ring, Still to be near him in adversity. I have prepar'd this cordial Draught for us. A noble, and preventing remedy: To free our Bodies from the Punishment, Our Minds from the Reproach, and Infamy, Our Eyes and Ears, from being Witnesses Of all those Cruelties, that are design'd. Contriv'd, reserv'd, and wait for conquer'd Men. Vib. We wonnot rob our Virtue of its Fame, To think that any here can stand in need Of words, to argue him into a deed, Of this high consequence and character. Blo. We are confirm'd in reason, and resolv'd. Pac. Then thus I offer you deliverance: And do begin a Health to Liberty. (Drinks. 5 Sen. A generous Health, and send it round to all. Blo. Fill all the Bowls at once, that we may joyn In that most noble Pledge; let no Man have Priority, or Place, in this last Scene, But all unite in honour of the deed. Vib. Let us unite our Hands, as well as Hearts, In this great Work: and since we are to part, We'll part like Friends, lockt in a strict embrace. (They embrace in a circle. Magius enters as they are in the Ceremony. Mag. I must not be shut out. I come to be Admitted to the gallant Fellowship Of your great Enterprize. I hear you are Determin'd and resolv'd. (Servants give each Man a Bowl. Give me a Cup Among the rest. 5 Sen. 'Tis Poyson— Mag. Not to me. Or if it shou'd be so, I come to dye. 6 Sen. We'll show you then the way. Mag. I'm old, and weak, And cannot follow fast, unless you stay, To take me with you in your Company. 6 Sen. We will. Pac. I'm sorry to see you reduc'd to dye. Mag. I'm sorry to see you reduc'd to live. Pac. That wou'd be poverty of Soul indeed. 'Tis, not so poor with me. Mag. I'm glad of it. 6 Sen. Pacuvius has drank his cordial off. Mag. Secure me mine, and then at leisure, I Will tell you the particulars at large, Of what I went about; the Consuls doom; And Capua's Fate— (Servant gives Magius a Bowl, they all drink together. But this delivers me. 5 Sen. And all of us. Blo. Now we defy the Doom. Pronounce it in the threatning Consuls words: Tho it shou'd thunder from the judgment Seat, It shakes not us. We have our Pardon seal'd. Mag. I was not suffer'd to approach their Camp, But as a private Person, and a Friend. They utterly refus'd the Prisoners, Disdaining to receive 'em, as a Bribe. And wou'd not hear me upon any terms, That I cou'd offer; all I cou'd obtain, Was to inform my self what they design'd To do with us. 6 Sen. It must be terrible. Mag. Why, Fourscore Senators are condemn'd to Death. Three Hundred of our noblest families, To be dispers'd into the Latin Towns, There to remain as Prisoners at large. Our Treasure all confiscated to Rome, our Lands and publick Buildings forfeited: Capua to be disfranchis'd of her Rights, Her Liberties, and her chief Citizens: The Populace by out-cry to be sold, Into the several States of Italy; And none permitted to inhabit here, But Slaves made Free, Strangers, and meanest Trades: Never to be incorporated more In a Community, to have a Voice In free Election of its Magistrates, But live enthrall'd under the Scourge of Rome. Vib. More dreadful far than Fire, or Sword cou'd be. Blo. It had been Mercy to extirpate quite The Name, and Memory of Capua. Mag. As to my self, 'tis true, they offer'd all, All honourable terms for me, and mine. But what is Honour, Fortune, when we have No Friends, no Country, to rejoyce with us? I cou'd not think of Life after that Loss, Therefore came timely to prevent it here. Pac. O Magius! let me witness to the worth, I always envy'd. We have rivall'd long For Capua's Love; but this last act of yours Has forc'd me to confess it was your due. Has thrown all emulation so behind, The Honour of the Race is wholly yours. Had I proceeded with that openess, With that clear Spirit, in my Countries cause— Mag. May be it had been better for us all. This is no time for long Confessions. If you have done amiss, amend it now: And by the brave example of your Death, Correct the influence of an ill spent Life. Pac. I've found this easie, honest way to Death: The only way, my Friends, to vanquish Rome, To rob her Consuls of their Triumph here, And bear our selves the palm of Victory. A Servant whispers Pacuvius, and gives him the Paper, that Junius left behind him. Mag. I thank the Gods I have liv'd long enough, To all the reasonable ends of Life: Liv'd to my Friends, my Country, and my Fame: Have glutted Nature with satiety, Tir'd all her various appetites of change. And 'twou'd be an unmannerly return, For my good cheer, and welcome of the Feast, When I have sat it out, to grudge to rise. Blo. We are all ready now to take our leave. Mag. But one word more, and then I go with you. (They support each other. Pac. She's Innocent, and well provided for. Mag. The Dead live after in the memory Of those alive, so to be handed down, Thro' all the Ages of Posterity, As Tryers of their Fame; abhorr'd, or lov'd, According to their good, or ill, in Life. Pac. I wou'd be mention'd only in my Death, Mag. Let it be said of us, we wou'd have dy'd To save our Country; since we cou'd not that: Nothing cou'd tempt us to survive its fate. Now lay us gently down. Enter a Messenger. Vib. What is thy News? Mess. Our Gates are open'd to the Enemy: And Capua is no more. Blo. Wou'd it were so. Better be nothing than be miserable. Pac. Thou com'st too late to do us good, or harm, By any News that thou canst bring us now. Mag. I pity our poor Friends that stay behind. Our Minds are going to their native home. And for the earthy part— Pac. I've taken care. When we are honourably laid in Death, My Clients have their orders to bestow Our Bodies on a Funeral Pile, that's rais'd On purpose, to preserve our last remains. Mag. 'Tis well, now kindle it, and we shall mount Up to the Skies, in the aspiring Flame, And live Immortal in a glorious Name, (Dyes FINIS.</field>
