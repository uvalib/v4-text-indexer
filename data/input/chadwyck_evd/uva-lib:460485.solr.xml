      <field name="fulltext">THE PROVOST OF BRUGES: A TRAGEDY. IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO WILLIAM CHARLES MACREADY, Esq. My Dear Sir, There are few moments in a man's life more happy than that in which he first indulges the hope of discharging a portion, however small, of a heavy debt of gratitude. With such feelings I long since, in fancy, dedicated this Play to you; yet now I falter under a sense of the unworthiness of the offering. Let me, however, hope that as your kindness encouraged, your judgement corrected, and your genius filled up the imperfect outline, so your friendship may accept the completed work, whose greatest value to me is, that it enables me to declare how truly I am, My Dear Sir, Your ever Obliged And Most Grateful Servant, THE AUTHOR.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SceneâThe City of Bruges. Time 1127.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Street in Bruges. Enter Gautier and Albert, meeting. ALBERT. Sir Gautier, you are welcome back to Bruges. GAUTIER. I thank you; what's the latest news at Court? ALBERT. Nay, that I rather should inquire of you, As being of the Council. GAUTIER. You forget, I have this moment only left my horse, And have all things to learn. ALBERT. Thenâas I hear, The Council are now met in grave debate To give their old device its newest form. GAUTIER. The Serfs? ALBERT. The same. The bonds of vassalage Have been for centuries so loosely worn; Thousands of Serfs are grown to wealthy Burghers, And 'tis no easy task to win them back: For this the Earl sends edict upon edict; Yet some escape him still, till it is said He now intends by some yet stronger measures To break down every hold that shelters them. GAUTIER. What says Bertulphe to this? for he was ever The champion of Freedom. ALBERT. There's their strength. Bertulphe is absent now, and many a tongue Votes loudly for these laws, that dared not wag Were the great Provost present. GAUTIER. Then will I instant to the Council Hall, And give my voice against this tyranny. [going. ALBERT. Yet hold! There seems a stir among the populace: And look, they come this way. GAUTIER. Stand back, and listen. Enter several Citizens. FIRST CITIZEN. 'Tis a vile law. SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, a most scandalousâa disgrace to Bruges. THIRD CITIZEN. 'Tis a good, wholesome law. SECOND CITIZEN. I say, it is rank tyranny. ALBERT [to GAUTIER.] Shall we inquire? GAUTIER. No! not of these. The vulgar voice speaks ever Distorted marvels; rather seek our friends, And learn from them the truth of this day's business. ALBERT. I will go with you. [Exit GAUTIER and ALBERT. Enter Antoine. Why! what's the matter now, my masters? FIRST CITIZEN. Have you not heard the proclamation, Antoine? Fresh rigours for the poor Serfs! ANTOINE. Nay, but that's bad. THIRD CITIZEN. 'Tis the Earl's law. ANTOINE. Nay, then it's very good!âHe is the good Earl, the good tree bears good fruit; therefore the good Earl's law is good beyond all questioning. SECOND CITIZEN. And your logic is very good for the free Burgher, Antoine; but should some Noble come, and, having proved your grandfather was once a Serf, claim YOU for that to be his bondsman, you'd tell another story. ANTOINE. Perhaps I should; but the Earl's law would be a good law, notwithstanding my complaining. THIRD CITIZEN. Well argued, friend Antoine. Enter Denis. DENIS. Ay, marry is it!âwhy should not the Serf's chain be as hereditary as Noble's land? The good Earl wills itâthe noble, virtuous Earl that you all love so. It is his justice, forsooth, that every hour issues fresh laws against the unhappy devils who may in the course of centuries have contrived to slip their chains of vassalage. It is his justice that now gives their lords full power to pounce upon them wherever they may find them, or in whatever rank their thrifty industry may have raised them to.âAnd this is âCharles the Good!â ANTOINE. Come! come! no treason, Denis! if the Earl wills it, it must be right. Besides, Heaven makes births as well as marriages; and if the saints had not willed that the man was to live a slave, they would never have let him be born one. FOURTH CITIZEN. There's something in that! DENIS. Well! for my own part, I confess myself a Serf, and try to look no better than I amâwear my chains with the grace of a practised slaveâdo my master's bidding with an humble reverence,âand receive his buffets with the most profound respect. ANTOINE. True! true! you're a good ladâthat is the only wisdom now. DENIS. But guard yourself against your would-be free manâ your upstart bloods of yesterday, who cannot claim more than a century of unquestioned libertyâfellows whose genealogy stops short on this side Adam. By my faith, if you wed your pretty daughter, Blanche, to one of these, to-morrow may see her claimed as some Noble's slave, and a few side-blows of her husband's cudgellings fall on the shoulders of his respected father-in-law, the free burgher Antoine. ANTOINE [aside to DENIS.] I wonder if I am a free man. DENIS. Do you remember your father? ANTOINE. It's a long while ago. DENIS. Your grandfather? ANTOINE. Worse still. DENIS. Great-grandfather, and great-great-grandfather? ANTOINE. I never had any to my knowledge! DENIS. By my holidame then your chance is a bad oneâfor the man who cannot count back thirteen generations will scarce be safe from seizure under the new laws. ANTOINE. Dear! dear! this is very shocking, though. Nobody knows now, whether he is his own or somebody's else. FIRST CITIZEN. The Earl had not dared to do this, had the Provost Bertulphe been present. ANTOINE. The Provost is a good man, and a great man. DENIS. The Provost is a proud man. ANTOINE. Go to! Denis. You are a discontented manâyou ever rail against the great. DENIS. I say the Provost is a proud man. Look at his retinue, â'tis scarcely second to the Earl's: look at his palace,âit adjoins the Earl's, and frowns upon the town as haughtily: look at his bearingânot the Earl himself has half such stateliness! Go to! His opposition to these laws is not for you, but for his own pride's sake, that loves to struggle with his master, who has made him what he is. FIRST CITIZEN. Nay! the Earl owes him muchâhis very throne. DENIS. Ay, and the Provost makes him feel the debt. ANTOINE. Say what you will, the Provost is a great man,âkeeps a great retinue,âhas private doors of communication with the palace. Oh! he is a very great man, a wonderful man: if the Provost was but the Earl, I would say he was a matchless man. FOURTH CITIZEN. Hark ye, my masters, 'twere best you drop this matter, for here comes Sir Bouchard, the Provost's son-in-law. SECOND CITIZEN. And with him young St. Prieux! 'tis dangerous talking, then.âHush! they are here. Enter Bouchard and St. Prieux. ST. PRIEUX. How now, fellows! where are your caps? Into your kennels, dogs!âyou taint the air! DENIS. 'Tis pity, sir, but Nature makes us breathe it. ANTOINE. Good Denis, come this wayâthey are great men, very great men. This way, good Master Denis. [forces him into the house, and follows, making low obeisances. ST. PRIEUX (to Citizens.) Now, fellows! Wherefore do you linger? FIRST CITIZEN. Is there not space enough, my lord? ST. PRIEUX. There are some sturdy knaves among you: look you, I'll search into your pedigrees. [The citizens slink away one by one. BOUCHARD. Fie, fie, St. Prieux! ST. PRIEUX. Ha! Ha! 'Sooth, 'tis a wise provision of the Earl To make new pastimes for usâold ones pall. To chase the wolf, or hunt the bounding stag, Is pleasant for a season;âbut at last It grows monotonous. The hunt to-day Is too much like the hunt of yesterdayâ That to the day before: the senseless beasts Have all the same defenceâuse it the same:â But this new sportâto hunt old Burghers down, Put them upon their pedigrees, and watch The shuffling rogues, doubling with cunning skill, To hide some flaw of serfship in their blood;â To track them on till not a shift is left, But he must own his father's grandfather Was once my lordship's serf;âthen pounce upon him With âSirrah, you are mine then,âhie you off To my estate, and wait my noble will!â Oh! this is sport indeed!âa most rare law! But why so grave, Bouchard? BOUCHARD. To think that men, with such great qualities, So noble, wise, and virtuous, as the Earl, Should still, to please some petty vanity, Mar all their graces, and defile their honours. ST. PRIEUX. Why, man, it is his virtue, his staunch justice, Resolved to give to every one his own;â My serf is mine, his justice gives him to me. BOUCHARD. 'Tis thus for ever that ill-judging zeal Goads virtue into vice. 'Tis but degree That marks the storm from the propitious galeâ The torrent, from the fertilising stream.â This justice, over-urged, grows tyranny. ST. PRIEUX. Ay, thus you moralised before the Councilâ Nay, wax'd so warm, defending your sweet clients, I thought you meant to beard the Earl himself. BOUCHARD. I did but speak, because more worthy lips Were silent: if the Provost had been there, He would have poured resistless thunders on them. ST. PRIEUX. But grave Bouchard, think of the pretty pickings Among the Burghers' daughters! Serfsâall Serfs! BOUCHARD. Now shame upon you. ST. PRIEUX. Oh! I cry you mercy!â I had forgot Bouchard was now a bridegroom, And dared not look beyond his legal portion;â Well!âwell! the girl is worth it. I believe, I could be constant for a month myself To such a wifeâshe has some rare deservings, And charms not common. BOUCHARD. All the gods could give her!â Beauty, to shame young Love's most servent dreamâ Virtue, to form a saint, and reign in heaven,â With just enough of earth to keep her woman! ST. PRIEUX. And the great Provost for her father, which In my poor judgment outweighs all the rest. BOUCHARD. Were she a sempstress at a cottage-door, Her parents hinds, I had not loved her less;â But Heaven's most glorious works are never cast With such a thriftless hand;âthe perfect flower Grows but upon a rich and generous soil; And such a sweet perfection, as my Constance, Could only spring from such a noble stem. ST. PRIEUX. 'Twere heresy to doubt it, though in truth That noble stem must have been somewhat shrunk Before Bertulphe shot from it. I confess His wealth enormous, and his station high, Without an equal, save the Earl himself: And even he had scarce been what he is, Without the Provost's mighty hand to help him. Yet still his fortune is his own creation, And his the earliest name of all his houseâ Whose deeds stand forth upon the page of fame. BOUCHARD. And what of that? Regard him as he is! Think of the arm that saved the State in warâ The wisdom that has sway'd its peaceful councils;â View the proud step that spurns the lowly earthâ The untamed eye, whose fire no years can quench.â Hark to the voice, whose music wraps the soul; A line of kings might pride to call him son, And he might trace him to a line of kings, Were such a vulgar glory worth his care;â St. Prieux, that eagle was not sparrow-hatched. ST. PRIEUX. Pray Heaven, that eagle do not soar too high! The cloud conceals the lightning. Sovereigns oft Regard with jealous eyes who come too near; And I could sometimes fancy, spite of all The smooth behaviour carefully sustain'd, There floats a little cloud that dims the sunshine, Before it reaches the great Provost. BOUCHARD. Let it! Bertulphe I say is mightier than the Earl; His friends fill every place of trust; the roots Of his great strength are spread amid the soil So widely round, that who should seek to shake him Would rock the State to ruin. ST. PRIEUX. Here comes one Will scarce cry Ay to that. For very sport I'll stir his gall up, if he pass this way. BOUCHARD. That were not wiseâSir Thancmar, as you know, Is highly favour'd of the Earl; and men From late events are prompt to seize on all, That makes Bertulphe seem rival to his sovereign. A bitter jest between their nearest friends Might lead to that which would but more confirm What yet is rather felt than seen or talk'd of. ST. PRIEUX. Ha! Sir Bouchard, you fear the Chatelain! Beshrew me, but I'll set him on you then. [Enter Thancmarâhe is crossing when St. P. stops him.] Sir Thancmar, have you leisure to decide In a dispute just now arisen between us? Bouchard here holds that rank of ancestry,â Say the good Earl's, weighs nothing with the wise;â And that the man whose genius,âsay Bertulphe's,â Gives him a power that rises over rank, And binds the world beneath him, more deserves Homage, than one from mighty kings descended. THANCMAR. The knight is wise, exalting that most high From which himself depends, and draws his greatness. BOUCHARD. Thancmar! that's scarcely courteous.âI depend On no man's greatness, but my own; the which I have received from as pure ancestry As thou canst boast, and will as pure transmit it.â THANCMAR. To the descendants of Bertulphe! 'Tis wellâ He needs such aid.âHis upstart arrogance Must find its strength in old and noble names, With which so eagerly he binds himself, 'Twere scarce a lack of charity to think His own had known some flaw. BOUCHARD. Your gentle breeding Should teach more manners. THANCMAR. I am slow to learn, sirâ I have not your advantage in the lessons The Provost can impart;âwhen is the season To smile, and when to frown,âand how, when Nobles Look cold on you, to turn with ready shift To base-born citizens, and gain their voices With feigned regard for what they term their rightsâ Suck in the breath of popular applause, Even while you loathe the applauders,âany thing That offers food to the o'erbloated pride Which craves the more for feeding. I have not Such masters in these arts, as you can boast,â Bertulphe, and Bertulphe's daughter. BOUCHARD. Slanderous villain! Unsay that gross reproach, or with my sword I'll force denial from thee. THANCMAR. Spare your frowns! I wear no steel for brawlings in the street. If you would fix a quarrel on me, be it Decided in the face of all the world, In knightly arms,âunless Bertulphe forbid it. BOUCHARD. Insolent!âThere's my glove! and may the spirit Of my unblemish'd race wither my arm If thou pay not this insult with thy blood. THANCMAR. Whene'er you will. [Exit. BOUCHARD. St. Prieux, this is not well,â You have driven me where I would most avoid;â And but that he threw slander on my wifeâ ST. PRIEUX. Tush, man! 'Tis excellent!â'tis admirable!â The very thing I drove at. Know you not The Provost hates this Thancmar? and Bertulphe Is not a man idly to fling his passions Without a cause. In his most jocund hours Name but the Chatelain, and o'er his brow The darkness gathers, and his words have in them A bitterness of hatred, that might seem almost The hate of fear. BOUCHARD. Bertulphe fear Thancmar? ST. PRIEUX. The word seems strange, and yet the thing that is, Is none the less because we cannot fathom it.â This be assuredâSir Thancmar is the foe Of you and all your house, and stands betwixt Bertulphe and favour, more than all beside:â You are his match; you have fair ground of quarrel.â Heavens! man, what would you more? BOUCHARD. A lighter heartâfor mine, I know not why, Is heavyâ ST. PRIEUX. Up, and rouse it then with action! We'll do this quickly. Come, the Chatelain Once out of sight, Bertulphe will thank you for it. BOUCHARD. I do not think him such. My mind misgives me We have done ill, and that this hasty quarrel Will breed embarrassment and discord, where We most should wish for love. But 'tis too late To falter nowâI will abide the issue. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A magnificent chamber in the Chateau of Bertulphe.â Constance discovered seated at a window, through which the sun is seen setting. Constance (watching it). How fast he sinks, that glorious orb of light! To see him seated on his mid-day throne, Who but had deemed him fix'd for ever there, So high, so proudly rode he o'er the world. And is it thus with love? whose early beam Shines out as full of promise, as it never Could know decline. Has love its setting too?â Look! now he fades,âand nowâhe's gone!âpoor world! But poorer heart, whose light of love is sped. A few small clouds are lingering in his place, Bright with contending dyes,âcall these ambition, Fame, gloryâvapours that usurp Love's seat, And shine awhile with a fictitious splendour When he is goneâthen follow into darkness. There ends the likeness! the departed sun Will ride again as bright a course to-morrow; But love once set can know no second rising. (Advancing.) Alas! I'm wondrous sad to-day. Enter Bouchard. Indeed! Constance (running to and embracing him). Bouchard! I did not mean to give thee welcome: Thou hast been absent for so many hours, I had resolved to chide thee! I have grown Even sad for very lack of occupation.â My father absent, and my lord away, I deemed myself neglected,âthee unkind! BOUCHARD. 'Twas needful business that claim'd my care. CONSTANCE. You are not angry? BOUCHARD. Nay! Indeed. CONSTANCE. Yet still There dwells a heaviness upon your brow I was not wont to see, when we two met, Though parted but an hour.âPerhaps you are ill? BOUCHARD. Dear Constance, this is very wilfulness! CONSTANCE. Then be more merry,âI have grown, Bouchard, The fool of fondness, and you took indeed A heavy charge in making me your wife: I have been nursed so tenderly, that never A cloud has shadow'd o'er me.âFirst my father, My dear, dear father, watch'd me with such care I never had a wish, but ere it grew, 'Twas lost in the possession.âThen you came With love, that strove to make his love seem small, So fondly did you cherish me,âthen frown not Upon the child yourself did help to spoil!â Nay, that's so sad a smile; in sooth, dear husband, I had rather see you frown than smiling thus! Something is ill. BOUCHARD. If aught displeases thee Then all is ill:âyet say I am not merry, The fit will pass,âthe sooner if unmark'd. That were a barren clime where all was sun,â And the heart needs these little shades of care To feel its bliss as bliss.âWhere is thy father? CONSTANCE. Not yet arrived, although his messengers Bid us expect him hourly [a trumpet.]âHa! he is here! Quick to the gates, lose not a precious moment! Oh, how I long to feel his circling arms, And hear him bless his child!âmy dear, dear father! BOUCHARD. Constance! shall I be jealous? CONSTANCE. Not of him!â Not of my father,âhe who gave you that, Which, flatterer that you are, you have sworn so oft Was all your wealth;âwho cherished with such care The growing flower, unworthy of his pains Indeed, but all his garden yielded, and Then gave it you to wear;âno, not my father! Had you been six days absent, I would fly With as much joy to welcome your returnâ[hesitating] Perhaps with more.â[Enter Bertulphe.] Father, my own dear father! BERTULPHE. All watchful angels guard and bless my child! So! thou look'st bravely! not a trace of care:â A bright and dancing eye, a healthful cheek;â No vigils have disturb'd the wanton smiles That dimple there!âTraitress! there was a time When had thy father been a week away, Thou wouldst have chid the leaden-footed hours, Pined in thy chamber, saddened in thy sports, And wearied every saint for his return!â Bouchard, beshrew me, but I grudge thy share In that young heart, that once was all my own. Love her, my friend! she has been fondly cherish'd, And scarce is fitted for the ungentle world; But she is safe with thee. BOUCHARD. Safe as the blood That warmest circles in my heart of hearts, Which should be sooner drain'd than she be wrong'd. BERTULPHE. I thought soâor I had not given her to thee. CONSTANCE. You are weary, sir, with travelâwill you sit? BERTULPHE. Why, ayâ[sitting] Bouchard! these things make old men feel Their sand run low,âthe easy cushion'd chair, A stranger at their hearth, and all they loved Given to another;âa new generation Hustling us to our graves, while little sprouts Shoot fresh and green round the old wither'd trunk, Sheathing decay with renovated life:â We'll have them all anon. CONSTANCE. You are merry, sir. BERTULPHE. And wherefore not so, girl? I have grown sick Of the turmoil and care of the great world. I'd give my place up now to better men, And nurse my grandchildren. You smile, Bouchard! These arms have dandled her a thousand times, When I had more of care upon my heart For her, than thou shalt ever know for thine: They shall be princes! I will give them that That they shall bless the old man's memory When I am dust. CONSTANCE. Father, some other theme. BERTULPHE. Well, be it so.âThou art a silly child! Come thenâthe news, Bouchard? The sun no doubt Has not stood still because Bertulphe was absent; What do they at the Court? BOUCHARD. Nothing of note Beyond the following up the late caprice,â New laws against the Serfs. BERTULPHE. Indeed! BOUCHARD. The last Was strangeâtyrannical beyond example. Lest any Serf, escaped from vassalage, Should fence himself behind a Noble's power, By marriage of himself or of his child, It is decreed, such marriage being proved Within a year, the freeman so connected, Whate'er his rank, shall forfeit his degree, Even though knightly,âlose his wealth and lands, And taking taint from the unnatural match, Himself become a Serf. BERTULPHE, starting up. Impossible! Ha! ha! I see you have been play'd upon, Or you would play on me. It is not ill: These late caprices are indeed so wild, One might in sport say, it would come to this. BOUCHARD. Believe me, sir, I jest notâ'tis most true. BERTULPHE. Again! would you persuade me Charles has done this Without my counsel?âseized the very moment When I was absent?âSir, I'll not believe it. CONSTANCE. My father! you are strangely moved. BERTULPHE. Moved!â Humanity, our common nature outragedâ A leprous taint fix'd on our fellows' blood, Contaminating all that touches it;â And yet 'tis strange that I am moved? Fie! Fie! A man's a man; nor can another claim The right to buy, sell, or inherit him, Because he sprang from off a lower branch Of the great tree:âyet this is but a part. He who would have one fellow for his slave, Soon, step by step, would fetter all mankind. Such is not Charles's nature.âThis brave plot Is from another source:âI see the hand That plays the puppet with him;âsee the motive That guides it too. BOUCHARD. What motive? BERTULPHE. Have you eyes, And yet perceive it not? Do you not see Since I opposed these laws from the beginning Their strength displays my weakness?âHe, whose hand Would rule the helm, as I confess would mine, Must find it answer to his ready touch Upon the lightest breeze; which, if it do not, He knows his power is gone;âand this alone Would fret some men.âYou smile, and think this nothing: Go to! you are young,âthe practised seaman knows The coming tempest, in the little cloud That specks the horizon only. BOUCHARD. 'Tis strange! BERTULPHE, impatiently. Sir, what is strange? BOUCHARD. To see you shaken By what to me seem things of trifling import. BERTULPHE. Did you then sit unmoved to hear these projects? I know you did notâcould not.âYet at last Perhaps you are right. It is the old man's follyâ We see too farâNo more on'tâlet it pass.â Child, I am weary, bid them bring refreshment. Stayâkiss me ere you goâ[embracing her, and holding her some time gazing on her] There, leave me, leave me. [Exit Constance. Ha! ha! BOUCHARD. What mean you? BERTULPHE. Why, sir, look you! That noble creature, in whose form and soul All glorious things that dwell beneath the sun Are studded in a galaxy of brightnessâ Sheâmight be made a Serf by wedding you, If in your blood ran one polluted dropâ I pray you, see 'tis pure. BOUCHARD. You do not doubt it? BERTULPHE. No, not a jot, sir, but I would have you see To what such laws might lead.âNow fare you well, I am wearyâsomewhat sever'd with my travel, And would be left a little space alone;â So tell my daughterâand, for what you have seen, Your finger on your lip. Remember, power Is to the old what love is to the youngâ And both are jealous, if their mistress frowns, To keep the gossip from the prating world. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Closet in the Chateau of Thancmar. Enter Thancmar and Hebert. THANCMAR. You think then I must fight this hot-brain'd boy? HEBERT. Or that, or bear about a spotted honour, Tarnish'd with his defiance flung upon itâ I see no middle course. THANCMAR. Indeed? Good Hebert, I marvel much that one of ready parts, As I confess you are not wanting in themâ And one, who of the varied book of life Has turn'd o'er many pages, should be still So dull of vision, he can only see The broad and trodden highway paths of action; And would rush headlong on to his intent, Like the infuriate bull, blinded with rage; And like him, if his foe but step aside, Go blundering past the mark! HEBERT. Thancmar, your words Have so much wisdomâmy more sluggish sense Is honour'd by their teaching;âyet speak plainlyâ You will not fight Bouchard? THANCMAR. Not willingly. HEBERT. Yet why? You cannot fear him? THANCMAR. If I could, That were an unwise speech!âI do not fear him; But mark me, Hebertâhow for years I have striven Against the ascendancy of the proud Provost, You have not now to learnânor how his honours Still overtopping mine, have galled my spirit. But let that passâhis star is on the wane; The unsuspicious Earl gives me his ear, And I have used it so to my advantage, Backing my reasons with the Provost's pride, And opposition to these wholesome laws Against the Serfs, which I myself urge on, That even now Bertulphe's great power totters;â The links of Love that bound the two together, Each day are by some new estrangement weaken'd:â Were it then wise, just as my hopes are ripening, To risk them all against some trick of fence Of this young whipster's sword? HEBERT. 'Tis true, that were But a boy's folly, not a statesman's wisdom.â But how to 'scape with honour? Will you move The Earl, that he shall not allow this duel? THANCMAR. Such was my purpose, but there now has risen A brighter hope! Hast thou not seen an old man named Philippe?â A parched and haggard wretch, infirm and bent Beneath a pile of years that none can count; His feeble foot just balanced on the brink That severs life from deathâyet shrewd and cunningâ Greedy of gold, and of a spleenful malice, That loves to wound, as 'twould compensate thus The body's impotence, by the tongue's sharpnessâ He dwells beside the Church of NÃ´tre Dame! HEBERT. I think I have seen him, but it is long since. THANCMAR. I knew him in my youth, and even the I thought him old. And yet the crabbed churl Had a strange fondness for me, and would talk In his sour fashion with me by the hour.â I lost him then, to find him here in Bruges, Where he arrived, when first Bertulphe grew great.â He has lived in much seclusion, and the boors Dread him, as one with more than mortal dealingsâ And he has dealings I would fain unriddle; For I have had him watch'd, and been assured The Provost's Secretary visits there At cautious hours, and gold is heard to chink When he arrives! HEBERT. Indeed!âthat's strange. THANCMAR. I know Bertulphe profuse,â Generous, as fools would call it, but I know He scatters not his gold without a motiveâ He cannot love this manâthen he must fear him, And, it may be, is even in his power! Bertulphe is proud, and such discordant natures At length must jarâin this has been my hope. I have waited patiently for my occasion, And it has come.âPhilippe this morning watch'd The Provost's path, and would have spoken with him; But he dash'd proudly by: I mark'd the old man, And saw his sunken eye gleam with such malice As told he hated himâhe turned to me;â I thought he would have spoken, but he checked His struggling passion, and went slowly home, The better there to brood on it. HEBERT. 'Twas well! THANCMAR. 'Twas well, good Hebertâfor Philippe is here. HEBERT. Here! THANCMAR. Ay, has sought me out, forestall'd my wishes, And craves to speak with me. HEBERT. Shall I admit him? THANCMAR. Yes, but be cautiousâhe is shrewd and jealous;â Leave me to mould him [exit Hebert]. He must have some power To bind Bertulphe thus to him, and that power Transferr'd to me, I would not spare to use it. Enter Philippe. PHILIPPE. I have waited long; you show small courtesy To one who comes to serve you. THANCMAR. Good Philippe, I'm glad to see you well. PHILIPPE. Why, that's a pleasure, You might have earn'd on any day these ten years By a three minutes' journey. THANCMAR. Yet I'd serve you. You have been wrong'd; Bertulphe has slighted you; I will befriend you. PHILIPPE. That is very kind! But should Bouchard o'ermatch you, brave Sir Thancmar, The promise were worth little. He would fight you. THANCMAR. How know you that? PHILIPPE. The stars! You smile;âwhy, then 'Twas from some other source. I am old; but stillâ But still I know a little of what stirs in Bruges. You would escape this combatâ THANCMAR. Who says so? PHILIPPE. Good policy!âHi! Hi! Bouchard is youngâ Brave, very braveâSir Thancmar is a statesman. The Chatelain of Bourbourg has too much To stake upon a sword. Though I am oldâ A very old, poor man, yet, I thank Heaven, My wits are spared. You shall not fight Bouchard. THANCMAR. Indeed! PHILIPPE. I have said it. The great Bertulphe, the mighty, noble Provostâ I pray you frown not soâhi! hi! though I Am but a dog before him,âis so good He will not do the thing I warn him from. THANCMAR. Philippe, you have a power o'er this Provostâ PHILIPPE. I pray you interrupt me not. Your safety Must be provided first; the rest, at leisure We'll talk upon. You shall not fight Bouchard. THANCMAR. You have some motive thus to watch my safety. PHILIPPE. Motive!âWhy, ay! all men must have their motives, And most have many;âI have mine, no doubt. Perhaps I wish to use you; and, if so, 'Tis clear you serve my purpose better living Than you would dead; or, it may be, I love you. THANCMAR. Indeed! PHILIPPE. 'Tis strange, I know; yet I do love youâ I always loved you, even from a child. There was malice in you that I loved, 'Twas like myself:âenvy of others' goodâ Impatience of another's greatnessâspleen, That gave back hatred in return for favors;â 'Twas all so like myself: I loved you for it. Hi! hi! Go toâyou shall not fight Bouchard. THANCMAR. Philippe, let us speak plainly. You possess Something that gives you power on Bertulphe; Make but that secret mine, and whatsoever The price you ask, I'll double it. PHILIPPE. Sir Thancmar, Men call you wise; you must have read of one Who had a bird that laid him golden eggs Each day it lived. I'm not the fabled fool To kill my bird to get them all at once! THANCMAR. But I will give thee gold at thy desire. PHILIPPE. When my security is gone? Sir Thancmar, Men trade not so in Bruges. THANCMAR. You shall have Most full securityâbonds,âwhat you will! And take this purse in earnest of my faith. PHILIPPE. 'Tis a fair offerâan exceeding fair: I'll think upon it. Troth, the purse is heavy: Sir Thancmar, men report you rich,âI'll think on't. Bertulphe has scorn'd me;âhe is grown too proudâ But say no farther now. Thou shalt be safeâ Thou shalt not fight Bouchard; and for the rest, Beshrew me,âbut I'll think on't. Fare you well. [Exit Philippe. THANCMAR. What, Hebert! Enter Hebert. Hebert. Your success? THANCMAR. Full to my hopeâ The train is laid,âmy net is closing round him! Now haste thou to the Earl; tell him this quarrel; Against whose issue thou canst urge more reasons Than would in me be seemly: thou mayst make it Appear Bouchard set on me in revenge For the delay of those long-promised lands The Provost claims, and knows I covet. This, Well urged, as thou canst do it, will, 'tis likely, Make a new breach between them. Go, good Hebert, And I will read thy love in thy success. [Exit Hebert. The patient hound, that never leaves the track, Runs down his game before the day is spent. [Exit. SCENE II. Terrace before the Chateau of Bertulphe. Enter Constance and Ursula. Constance. Nay, my good Ursula, I pray thee chide not; There is a sadness of no kin to sorrow, And such alone is mine. Is it not sad, And yet how sweet, to sit in some close nook, And hear the big rain patter on the trees? Or, listlessly, in some cool dell's recess, To mark the babbling of the tiny brook? Or, from the casement, watch the fading day Tinge, with its changeful pencil, the gray clouds? When, if by chance we sigh, 'tis but to ease The heart o'erburthen'd with its sweet sensations! URSULA. Nonsense for school-girls! if you had told me this A year ago, I could have understood it;âbut now, pish! CONSTANCE. Prithee, good Ursula, rack not thy wits to find a Cause for that which is not. URSULA. Nay, but I say it is; and for the causeâI know that too. It is thy good knight's absence that has chafed thee, and he shall hear it; for, at last, he is coming. What is the Earl, that he should leave his wife to dangle in his Court? âI'll speak my mind on't. CONSTANCE. Ursula! Peace! Enter Bouchard. URSULA. Well, Sir Bouchard, you have come in a good hour! Marry, sir, 'tis well done with a three months' bride to leave her moping thus:âwere I your wife, I'd teach you better manners. There, go and make your peace. [To Constance] You will not need me now. [Exit. CONSTANCE. Love, heed her not; She speaks at random, but she means it kindly. BOUCHARD. Has Constance then been sad? CONSTANCE. To say I have not Would scarce be truth; and yet, to say I have, Would make me blush to seem so weak a child. BOUCHARD. Nay then, thou hast been sad; which, being confess'd, I claim to know the cause. CONSTANCE. You will but mock me: 'Twas but the offspring of a sickly fancy,â A silly fear, not worth another thought. BOUCHARD. It was a fear then? CONSTANCE. Yesâa heavy sadness That sat upon my heart, converting all things On which I look'd, to evil auguries. Last night, when o'er the thickly studded sky The fleecy clouds would ever and anon Eclipse the gems of Heaven, I mark'd one star That twinkled in its sphere so joyously, The pitying vapours, as in tenderness, Forebore that part of Heavenâand pass'd along On either side, leaving an open path Where that star lay: and, as I look'd on it, And thought upon my own unclouded life, I call'd that star myself; when, on the instant, A heavy streak, that had in ambush lain, Crept over it, and made a blot of darkness Where it had been. I saw my star no more! You do not smile, Bouchard? BOUCHARD. I cannot smile At that which makes thee sad: yet 'twas a folly. CONSTANCE. There was a flower too in my father's garden, So weak and helpless, that some gentle hand Had doubly propp'd its stem; and oft I said That plant was Constance, and its strong supporters You and my father. With this morning's dawn I sought it out; but both its props were broken, And the poor flower, that still clung closely to them, Lay with them in the dust. BOUCHARD. This is mere weakness: Give it no further thought. To-night, I warrant, Thy star shall shine again as bright as ever; And, for the other,âgo now to thy flower And see how soon thine own hand can restore Its fallen glories. So, thyself, unread Thine evil auguries. I will join thee soonâ Then will we find diversion: we will read, Or idly wander through the forest-glade, Or watch the eagle sailing in the clouds, Reduced by distance to so small a speck, The flower that decks thy hair can shut it out; And we will say that so each thought of care, Cast to a distance, is become a speck The little flower of the passing moment Can quite shut from our view. [Constance going. I will expect you:â But do not tarry. [Exit. BOUCHARD. This at least is strange! She knows not of my quarrel with the Chatelain: She has no ground of fear, yet fear comes o'er her As though some viewless agent whisper'd it. I have no leaning to these superstitions; But it may be that to Heaven's favourites Some ministering intelligence is sent To warn of coming dangers, or avert them. Well! Heaven guides all thingsâits high will be done! Enter Bertulphe hastily. BERTULPHE. You are well met, sir. What report is this I hear of brawlings in the street? Men's tongues Make feast of your contentions. This is ill, sirâ I like it not. This is no time for strivings, When we most need to treasure all our strength: We must make friends, not foes. I pray you, let Your foolish quarrel, whatsoe'er it be, Be reconciledâatoned for. BOUCHARD. 'Tis impossible! The affront was palpable, and public too. BERTULPHE. No matter, sir. BOUCHARD. But Thancmarâ BERTULPHE [suddenly.] What of him? Was it with Thancmar you had question? BOUCHARD. Ay! BERTULPHE. I knew not that; why was it kept from me? A public insult? He must answer it. BOUCHARD. He shall! BERTULPHE. You'll fight with him? BOUCHARD. I'm pledged to it. BERTULPHE [eagerly.] To the death? BOUCHARD. If need beâ BERTULPHE [grasping his hand.] Good!âthat's wellâthat's very well. Your honour must be kept an unflaw'd gem, Else are you not the husband of my child! Bouchard! I hold you are the Chatelain's match. You have practised much of late, I know you have. Look he escape you notâHis life, Bouchard! BOUCHARD. I do not understandâ BERTULPHE. No matter, boy! We'll fix the day;âyou shall have all support Myself and what I can call mine can give you. Come, we will to the Earl, and gain his licence To bring this quarrel to an issue. Ha! Proud Chatelain of Bourbourg, I have trapp'd thee, And thou shalt not escape with unclipt wings! So, to the Earl, my sonâto the just Earl. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Earl's Chamber of Audience.âGautier, Hackel, Albert, St. Prieux, Hebert, and others discovered in groups. Gautier [to Hebert.] Your friend, Sir Thancmar, remains long within. HEBERT. The Earl receives much counsel from him, sir, On matters not yet ripe for public question. ST. PRIEUX. Indeed! [Aside to the others.] Now would I wager my best horse His present argument to escape This combat with Bouchard; for if they meet, My life upon it, sirs, but it will rid The Provost of Sir Thancmar. HACKEL. 'Tis as ever! Bertulphe's good star serves him on all occasions, And, on the moment opposition rises, Gives him the means to crush it. GAUTIER. Hush! 'Tis the Earl. Enter Charles attended, accompanied by Thancmar. EARL. Good morrow, gentlemen! but I miss one, Whom most I wished to see. Enter Bertulphe and Bouchard attended. My trusty friend, You are right welcome. I desired your aid, And, with your customary promptness, you Anticipate my wish. BERTULPHE. My gracious Prince, I pray you overrate not my poor service. EARL. There is a foolish quarrel 'twixt Sir Thancmar And your brave son; we wish their reconcilement, And pray your mediation with Bouchard. BERTULPHE. I would your Highness had demanded of me Something wherein my duty to myself Permitted me to side with you. In this Our judgments stand opposed: it cannot be. EARL. Methinks, for one, whose calm and temper'd wisdom Should rule the fiery current of young bloods, You are somewhat sudden. Let them speak their own. Knowing thus far, we wish their reconcilement. BERTULPHE. Your pardon, sir: I have been bred a soldier, And, it may be, am somewhat over-nice On points of honour; and Bouchard's my son, Or stands to me in place of one. But still, Since 'tis your pleasure, let themselves determine. EARL. How say you, sirs? THANCMAR. My will, my gracious Sovereign, Waits ever on your own, which still shall rule me. BOUCHARD. And so would mine no less, did I not hear A higher call than even my Prince's favour, That bids me forward;â'tis the voice of honour, With whom, not me, this quarrel has been set. I dare not disobey that high command, And crave your Highness, for my honour's sake, We may have licence to proceed. BERTULPHE. Your Highness Perceives 'tis vain to patch this quarrel up; Such rotten love would yield a wider rent On the next touch. EARL. True, sir, I see 'tis vain:â When hoary age, that should apply the curb To youth's hot passions, plies the spur instead, The steed will run his course. Well, what's your will, sir? BERTULPHE. Your Highness' licence to decide this quarrel. EARL. And how if I refuse it? BERTULPHE. I will urge, As oft your Highness does, our fathers' customsâ The usage of an age; and in the strength Of your own argument, will so demand The ancient right of battle. EARL [unwillingly.] Be it soâ But I am little bounden to your love. Sir Thancmar, 'tis with you to name the day. THANCMAR. I care not, sir;âto-morrow if they will. BERTULPHE [eagerly.] To-morrow be it then. EARL. This is too sudden. BERTULPHE. Not so, my Lord; the longer such things rankle The sharper grows the sore. If we would cure, We must cure quickly. Let it be to-morrow. EARL. How say you, Thancmar? THANCMAR. As they will, my liegeâ They shall not find me backward. EARL. Then 'tis fix'd. And now, Sir Provost, since the business On which we sought you is so well concluded, We shall not need your further aid to-day. BERTULPHE. My Lord, a moment yet: there is a suit (I blush to think how often I have urged it) To which I came to press you to reply. EARL. The lands you claimâit shall be well consider'd. BERTULPHE. It shall be still. EARL. I have no further answer. Nobles, farewell. Sir Thancmar, come with me,â I wish your private counsel. [All bow and retire, except Bouchard, and Bertulphe, who remains with his eyes fixed on the Earl as he goes out with Thancmar. BERTULPHE [bitterly.] Do you so? And thus you'd think to frown me from my purposeâ That will be difficult. Your private counselâ I pray you do not scant it, gentle sirs, 'Twill be your last.âBouchard, prepare thee now; I know thy skill, but let thy heart go with it. Say, thou art matched against thy fiercest foe, Yet be not rashâhe is an adversary Worthy thy sword:âbe patient, calm, and watchful, But deadly in thy purpose. BOUCHARD. Yet I pray you, Wherefore this bitterness against Sir Thancmar? He is a noble knight, and well reputed, Although I love him not. BERTULPHE. Boy! there are creatures From which with natural antipathy The eye turns loathing, and when these unite A poisonous power to injure us, we crush them:â Such Thancmar is to meânow ask no farther, But go;âthou know'st thy dutyâfit thee for it. BOUCHARD. You shall not find me wanting. [Exit. BERTULPHE. 'Tis gainedâThancmar at length is in my grasp!â The foolâI had thought him wiser! Yet success Has been most dearly purchased. Charles resents The froward course my fate imposes on me, And thrusts me from his heart,âyes, that is bitter: 'Tis cruel, when the loves that we had cherish'd, And hoped should twine their last around our graves, Wither within our living grasp, and leave But ashes in their steadâ(with deep melancholy) Charles, Charles, thou lov'st me not. Enter Constance. Why, how now, girl!âis this a place for thee? What dost thou here? CONSTANCE. To seek my dear father, now my only hope. Oh! I have learn'd it allâthis threaten'd combatâ But you have power to bid them yet be friends: For your child's sake!âBouchard will yield to you, Though I implore in vain. We were so happyâ The wars all ended,âand I called him mine, Without a fear:âfather, preserve him to me:â Say but this shall not beâand he is safe. BERTULPHE. Thou silly child, is this thy mighty grief? For a mere pass of armsâa common joust Upon a point of honourâthou hast seen A hundred such. They meet and break a lanceâ Bouchard unseats him, and the quarrel's ended. CONSTANCE. But who can say 'twill be such easy conquest. Oh! should mischance befall himâfather, father, I shall die too. BERTULPHE. Art thou a soldier's wife! What means this whining? I had deemed of thee, Thou shouldst be mother to a race of heroes! But I was wrongâgo, spin among your maids,â Go, go, you trouble me. CONSTANCE. Oh, you are angry, And that is more than all;âturn to me, fatherâ Turn, smile upon me, I am but a woman,â You should remember that, but I will be All you would have me, that my sex permits. I cannot aid my Lord but with my prayers;â They are a woman's weapons; be they mine,â And if some tears should mingle with them, think They are a woman's too, and so forgive them. Nay, now you smile again, and I am happy. Enter Page. My Lord, a letter from the Earl. [Exit. BERTULPHE [opens the letterâreading it, starts, then pacing the stage with great irritation.] 'Tis to insult me. CONSTANCE. Is aught ill? BERTULPHE. Ill! no! A most rare jest, no more,ânought but a jest!â I asked this grateful Earl for certain lands, In bare requital of my services; Which lands he promised me, but still delay'd To give his word effect; and now he writes They shall be mine, provided I perform The customary homage. CONSTANCE. What is that? BERTULPHE. Oh, nought!âa jest, a very merry jest!â Crawl on my knees into his gracious presence, And pray him use me for his vilest service. Is it not rare! I like that rising flush!â That look! 'tis good! thou art my daughter!âcome! What shall we answer? CONSTANCE. Fling his offers back! BERTULPHE. Good! but still not enough. It is Bouchard Must answer him;ânay, now thou art pale again! 'Tis Thancmar that has set Charles on to this For his own profitâfor, on my refusal, He will accept the lands and do the homage:â Trust me he will,âhe shall live to do it. CONSTANCE. Oh! my father! BERTULPHE. Now by my soul, if thus you rave and sigh, You shall not see Bouchardâhe must be strong!â Well! thou shalt take a parting kiss,âno more! But we will have no tears; look well to that. Why, there they stand, even now!âWhat, was I harsh? Nay, I meant nothing,âonly these things turn The blood to gall;âcome, smile, my love,âcome, come. [Leads her off. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Country near Bruges.âCitizens discovered. FIRST CITIZEN. They cannot tarry long. 'Tis many a day since the old town saw such a fight as this bids fair to be. SECOND CITIZEN. I would I had a thousand crowns to stake upon Bouchard; âI'd wager freely. THIRD CITIZEN. I know not, Thancmar is exceeding braveâa perfect master of his weapon too. FOURTH CITIZEN. Few good men's prayers will aid him. SECOND CITIZEN. No! they will be Bouchard'sâfor he is ever the poor man's friend, and strives against these laws, that would oppress them. Enter Denis and Antoine. FIRST CITIZEN. Ah! my good friends, stirring to see the fight? DENIS. Ay, to be sure,â'tis the Serf's holiday when Nobles cut each other's throats! ANTOINE. Stirring! Why all the city's in a stir! and no man, who can walk, keeps house to-day:âlook yonder, if you would see what such a day can do. THIRD CITIZEN. Philippe!âimpossible! FOURTH CITIZEN. What, old Philippe! that we all thought would never leave his house again! ANTOINE. Oh, how the poor old man must love a show! THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, 'tis no show has drawn him out; I warrant he has read something in the stars. DENIS. 'Twere well if he could read there how to patch his shattered carcase up. The feeble wretch looks more a walking corpse than a live man! FIRST CITIZEN. Nay, by my troth, but he is very feeble! FOURTH CITIZEN. This apparition, to my thinking, bodes some great events from to-day's work. DENIS. 'Tis not unlikelyâfor on such occasions men say that evil spirits walk abroad. ANTOINE. Hush! should he hear you, you'll repent this. SECOND CITIZEN. See, he is here. [Enter Philippe.] Good-day, sweet master Philippe! PHILIPPE. Good-day, sweetârogue. SECOND CITIZEN. Why, by my troth, I am glad you look so haleâay, that I am. PHILIPPE. What foolery's this!âI am sickâmost sick!âand feeble. SECOND CITIZEN. Nay, troth, you look so. Wherefore came you forth? PHILIPPE. For my affairsânot yours! Where is the Provost? has he passed by? SECOND CITIZEN. Not yet. PHILIPPE [aside.] This must be stayedâI had rather lose a thousand crowns than lose Sir Thancmar.âHalf my power upon Bertulphe would go with him. Besides, he promised largely. ANTOINE. Hark! they are coming!âStand backâthe Show!âthe Show! [Trumpets heardâPhilippe places himself on one side where the procession has to pass.âEnter Heralds, Men-at-Arms, Knights, Banners, &amp;c. Thancmar supported by HebertâBouchard by Bertulphe: as they pass, PHILIPPE. Provost of Bruges, I must speak with you. BERTULPHE. Who's that? PHILIPPE. 'Tis I! BERTULPHE [advancing.] Philippe! what make you here? PHILIPPE. Bertulphe, I said that I must speak with you. BERTULPHE. Not hereânot nowâ PHILIPPE. Yes, here and now, Bertulphe!â Old, feeble as I am, I twice already To-day have sought admission at your palace, And twice you have denied me. You shall hear me! BERTULPHE. Be quickâwhat would you? PHILIPPE. Stay this combat. BERTULPHE. Stay it!â Not though 'twere the condition of the fight To hold it o'er my corse! PHILIPPE. Bertulphe, beware!â Beware, great Provost, how you anger me!â BERTULPHE. Dog! do you threaten? PHILIPPE. Do not force me to it. BERTULPHE. Slave, would you beard me? Peace, thou drivelling dotard, And home in silenceâsound the trumpets.âForward!â [Exit with the processionâthe greater part of the Citizens followâa few remain behind.] PHILIPPE. What! does he mock me? Nay, but he shall hear me, Or I will ruin both. [Hurries after him. SECOND CITIZEN. What may this mean? FOURTH CITIZEN. I know notâ'tis most strange!âSee, he has gained Bertulpheâhe stops his pathâlook how he clings to him! THIRD CITIZEN. Bertulphe's incensed. SECOND CITIZEN. Ha! he has struck him down! FOURTH CITIZEN. Nay, 'twas not soâhe did but fling him from himâ 'Twas the crowd. THIRD CITIZEN. The old man's hurt. They are bringing him this way. [Re-enter Philippe, led in by two Citizens.] SECOND CITIZEN. How now, Philippe! PHILIPPE [choking with rage.] Slave!âslave!âHe called me slave!âstruck meâ support me, friendsâI am much hurtâslave!âhe shall pay for it. Proud as he is.âHere! [whispers one of the Citizens who goes out.] Slave!âThe upstart!âstrike me too! softly! softlyâbear me homeâungrateful!â slave!â [Exit, led off.âRe-enter Bertuplhe and Charente.] BERTULPHE. Where is the old man? I fear me I have hurt him. CHARENTE. Yonder I think they bear him. BERTULPHE. Follow after, And bid him come to me: lose not a moment;â And stayâhere's goldâgive him this tooâand charge him, As he would keep my favour, that he come Upon the instantâcome to the Chateauâ For I shall home at onceâSpeak kindly to him;â Be liberal of all that thou canst offer;â Give all he asks;âand lookâold men are testy, And nurse their angerâsay, I did him wrongâ That I had cares that vex'd me:âyou may addâ Yesâyou may say I even am sorry for it:â But look you bring him with you!âAnd now quickâ Away. [Exit Charente.] Oh, fool!âimpatient, headstrong fool! To let my passion master meâI had not But for his threatâand thatâhe could not mean it!â 'Twas but a threatâa fit of spleenâno more. Yet I must see him:âWhat! my horse there! Ho! [Exit. SCENE II. A Hall in the Chateau of Bertulphe.âSeneschal and Page discovered.âPage looking through a window. PAGE. I would I could hear some sound of this great day, though it were but a distant shout. SENESCHAL. Tush, boy! You will have enough of this before you have a beard. PAGE. Think you it is begun? SENESCHAL. Why, hardly yet. PAGE. And will they fight to the death? SENESCHAL. Marry, I think they will. I have served my Lord for many a long year now, and know his manner; and he looked this morning, just as he does before some mighty battleâgrave, silent, and determined. If he has any influence with Bouchard, this will be no child's play. But hark! what sound is that? PAGE. A horse's hoofsâand at his speed too! SENESCHAL [looking out.] By St. Denis, it is my Lordâand unattended! PAGE. Bouchard must have been worsted! SENESCHAL. Hush! Enter Bertulphe. BERTULPHE. Now, is Charente returned? PAGE. Charente! my Lord? BERTULPHE. I asked not for an echo of my words:â Is he come home? PAGE. My Lord, I have not seen him Since he left here with you. BERTULPHE. The slave grows sluggish!â What could the dotard mean?âThat threat! he dared notâ Would not for his own sake. SENESCHAL. My Lord, he comes. Enter Charente. BERTULPHE. Wait you without. [Exeunt Page and Seneschal. Now, where is the old man? CHARENTE. Beyond your ordersâhe is dead, my Lord. BERTULPHE. Dead! Dar'st thou jest with me? CHARENTE. In truth, sirâdead! BERTULPHE. The old man dead! Say,âdidst thou see the body? CHARENTE. My Lord, I did. He died while I was present. BERTULPHE [walking about.] Nayâthis surpasses reason!âI have lived A life of fear because of that old man, Whose years seemed lengthened but to torture me;â Even in my proudest moments,âay, when princes Appear'd my suitors, and I dared to spurn them, Even then I dared not think of that old man!â His living image poison'd all my hours,â Sicklied with terror every springing joy, And nowâthe moment that I fear'd him most,â They tell me he is dead! Be merry, heart! Bertulphe! thou art now indeed great above fate;â This crowns thy former greatnessâstamps it real;â Why dost thou tremble then!âThou art a prince! None can dispute thy title! [seeing Charente] How now, sirrah Wherefore delay you thus?â CHARENTE. There was a thing I have not told, my Lord, which yet seem'd strange. BERTULPHE. Speak onâwhat was it? CHARENTE. By the old man's side I found Sir Thancmar. BERTULPHE. Liar! CHARENTE. Nay, indeed 'Tis true!âHe had been summon'd from the lists, And ere the old man's parting breath had gone, Spurr'd back in haste again. BERTULPHE [trembling.] A chairâa chair! [sinks into it.] I am very faint. CHARENTE. My Lord, I'll call for help. BERTULPHE [eagerly.] Noânot a word! 'tis pastâa sudden weaknessâ[rapidly.] Charente, my horse is at the gate. Goâtake himâ Spare not his speed, but hasten to the lists;â Tell Sir Bouchard, that as he loves his soul, His fame, his lady's honourâby whatever Thou canst conjure most stronglyâbid him see That Thancmar do not quit the field alive!â Bid him not leave so much of breath in him As may give utterance to a single word!â Perform this wellâand all thy fortune's made! Away! [Exit Charente.] Have mercy, Heaven! Enter Servant. SERVANT. My Lord! BERTULPHE. How now! Why stand'st thou gaping with that idiot stare? SERVANT. Because my lips will scarce deliver that Which I would speak. BERTULPHE. Out with it, man, at once! SERVANT. Sir Thancmar left the lists, but soon return'd; When, as Bouchard's defiance met his ear, He threw his gauntlet backâtoss'd by his lanceâ And said that he disdain'd in knightly arms To combat with a Serf! BERTULPHE. They did not fight? SERVANT. They did not, sir. BERTULPHE. Then, that last hope is gone! Leave meâI'd be alone. [Exit Servant.]â'Tis done, 'tis done! All's over, and all known!âI have soar'd high, But, like the Grecian boy, my waxen wings Are melted in a moment, and I fall Downâdownâto utter ruin. Enter Bouchard [hastily.] BOUCHARD. Bertulphe, am I a Serf? BERTULPHE. Why, now thou ravest. BOUCHARD. Fly not from the point, But answer me. Am I a Serf, Bertulphe? BERTULPHE. There's not a Noble living in all Flanders Can boast a purer ancestry. BOUCHARD. I know it: But I have mix'd their lofty blood with thine. 'Tis there the blow would reach me;â'tis through thee! Sayâart thou free? BERTULPHE [undecidedly.] Free?âYes. BOUCHARD [with violent impatience.] Torture me not,â But tell me,âart thou free? BERTULPHE. I amâfor I am a man! BOUCHARD. By Heaven, if thus thou playest with my words, Thou'lt drive my frenzy to some desperate act, My reason will repent!âWert thou born noble? BERTULPHE [calmly.] No!âNever clasp thy hands in idle rage, But listen!âI was born of humble stock,â Since now 'tis useless to affect concealmentâ Serfsâas your nobles call them: but I found That in my breast which might have fill'd a king'sâ A heart as proud as ever chafed at bondage. When manhood had braced up my limbs, I left My adopted homeâit was the old Philippe's,â For both my parents died:âthis was the tie Gave him such power on me: I left my countryâ I fled the soil they would have chained me to, And join'd the foreign wars. In my first fight I cleft a Noble to the waist. How now! I cried: is this a Serf? Another fell; 'Twas strange a Serf should mow down knights like grass!â My fortune smiledâI rose to a command; And still was conqueror, till my fame so grew, That Nobles flock'd to fight beneath my banner. Oh! then how the Serf smiled! I join'd the Council, And baffled haughty princes, crafty statesmenâ All of most noble blood;âyet none could stand Before the Serfâuntil at length this Earl, Even Charles himself, besought my powerful arm, On Baldwin's death, to prop his infant cause;â I placed him on his throneâIâIâBertulphe! I placed himâheld him there! Now tell me, boy, Where is the drop of blood within these veins, That speaks its baseness? or, if none, confess Heaven made no Serfs, but only man's device To trample on his fellows! BOUCHARD. I confess That you are greatâwiseâI believe you good! But you have wrong'd me foullyâsunk meâcrush'd meâ Blasted the honour of my noble houseâ Degradedâlost me.âHeavens! Bouchard a Serf!â Villain! this was a plot from the beginningâ A trick to gild with my more noble name Thine own base metal,âand you angled for me With a girl's smiles;âyour daughter for a bait! BERTULPHE [with fury.] Bouchard!âBut no, you are angry,âI forgive youâ 'Twas not your heart spoke that;âgo, I forgive you. BOUCHARD. Oh! you are wondrous calm amid the ruin That you have wrought! yet why should it seem strange,â 'Tis nature in youâyou were bred to it. Go, do your master's bidding,âdig his fields,â Crouch, fawn, and flatter for the crust that feeds you! I cannot do thisâI was born a Noble; My father's blood is stirring in my veins, And bids me nobly die!âBertulphe, farewell! [going.] BERTULPHE. Stay!âI command you. BOUCHARD. What! a Serf already To be commanded! BERTULPHE. Yesâwith such fond sway As fathers exercise upon their sons! Thou art my son, Bouchard; I had no boy Till I chose thee as such, and loved thee so, Nor loved thee thanklessly:âcome, come,âenough Of childish raving;ânow we'll talk like men. Thou think'st our state is hopeless,â'tis not so: This law is but a fanciful caprice That cannot bear enforcement; if it could, 'Twould not be first let loose upon his friends:â Or even could this be, I have deserved Too well of Charles to meet with such return: Or grant him even willing, where's the proof?â A dotard's ravings in the hour of death, When the tongue speaks without the sense's guidance. See you not this?âGo to!âGo to!âthou art frighted With such a phantom, would not scare a child! BOUCHARD. O misery! to cling to hopes like these, Once having been so great. BERTULPHE. Look you, Bouchard,â 'Tis idle to repine;â'tis base,â'tis girlish! Bind all your friends with double bands around you, And meet the peril boldly. This remember, That thou and I are one: not all thy power Can shake me off:âwe stand, or fall together. BOUCHARD. Too well I see it. BERTULPHE. Let us then be friends! BOUCHARD. Friends? BERTULPHE. Yes, disunion will effect far more Than all our foes can compass;âcease these sighs;â Off with this childish sorrow!âBy my soul I took thee for a man,âbut now I think Thou art some whining girl!âWhere is thy spirit? BOUCHARD. Lost, with my honour;âthe Serf weighs me down,â I feel its influence!âBut I will not drag On this degraded life. [Going.] BERTULPHE. Then hear me, Serf!â Since thou wilt be a slave, and so wilt die,â Go,âgive this triumph to thy foes,âand let them Raise over thee a mocking monument, And say,âHere lies Bouchard, the Serf of Thancmar! BOUCHARD. Of Thancmar! BERTULPHE. Ay! 'Twas on his father's land My father dwelt;âif we are Serfs, Bouchard, He is our master,âhe thy lord,âthy wife's! Now dost thou ask wherefore I hated him? BOUCHARD. There needed only this! BERTULPHE. Wilt die his Serf? BOUCHARD. No,ânot if living through the heaviest ills That fate can pour, or trembling nature bear, Will give one hope of vengeance. BERTULPHE. Bravely said! It shall,âthy hand!âGood!ânow look boldly on The danger thou wouldst conquer as thou'dst look Upon a foe in battle:âand remember, Great minds are mightiest upon great occasions;â Go,âleave the rest to me,âand chance what may, Think nothing lost till we desert ourselves. BOUCHARD. I will expect you,âlook you fail me not! [Exit. BERTULPHE. I have turn'd his headlong passion for awhile, And must employ the interval.âBut how! Heaven guide me!âfor my own distracted sense Knows not what course to take,âbut overpower'd Loses its early strength, and, palsied, sinks! [Exit. Enter HACKEL, GAUTIER, ALBERT, and SENESCHAL. SENESCHAL. Indeed, my Lords, you cannot see Bouchard. HACKEL. We must. SENESCHAL. Dear sirs, I pray you have compassionâ Press not upon him now,âhe is distracted:â A message from the Court has just arrived,â He cannot see you. GAUTIER. Ha! so soon upon him! Bear you our wishes,âleave the rest to us,â Say, we would see him instantly. [Exit Seneschal. ALBERT. This looks indeed like action. HACKEL. Doubt it not, Since Thancmar has the handling on't. ALBERT. Yet tell meâ How does the city bear these startling tidings? GAUTIER. Nay, 'tis no time for question.âConsternation As yet hath found no tongue,âall is amazement;â Men meet and stare into each other's faces, And each forbears to speak, lest the mere words, The Provost is a Serf,âshould stamp him madman. HACKEL. He was the poor man's hope:âand now they stand, Like frighted cattle that beneath an oak Had sought protection from the threatening storm, And find the forked lightning's earliest flash Strike even there where they had made their shelter. ALBERT. Bouchard is here. Enter Bouchard. BOUCHARD. Now,âwhere are these intruders? GAUTIER. 'Tis your friends. BOUCHARD. Friends!âwhy then leave me. HACKEL. Nay, we come to aid you. BOUCHARD. If you are men,âif you have souls, sense, feelings,â If you would have me keep one spark of reason,â Go,âleave me!âleave me! GAUTIER. We come to offer you assistance,âcounsel. BOUCHARD. Counsel to such a madden'd wretch as I? Go,âgo,âprate to the whirlwind. GAUTIER. Yet one word:â A messenger has been with you,âhis purpose? BOUCHARD. To summon me, as Thancmar's Serf, to hasten To his estate, and wait his will! GAUTIER. Your answer? BOUCHARD. Answer?âI struck him dead! Nay, spare your wonder:â And now you have my news; go, be content,â No further words. HACKEL. We'll speak with you to-morrow. BOUCHARD. To-morrow, ay, or any time but now! Thereâgoâgoâgo! [Exeunt.] I shall be calm to-morrow! Exceeding calm!âhis Serf!âhisâThancmar's Serf! [Walking about.] Enter Constance. CONSTANCE. Bouchard! BOUCHARD. Again!âI have avoided youâ I pray you, Madam, hang not on my stepsâ I have some mischievous feelings in my breast That cannot brook your presence,âpray you, leave me!â Why stand you gazing with doubtful look? Conceive you not my words? Leave me, I say! CONSTANCE. Bouchard!âmy Lord!âOh, no! 'tis not my Lord Who speaks so cruelly. BOUCHARD. What would you have? CONSTANCE. Alas! I know not! and yet this I know,â Bouchard has often said, if care annoy'd him, 'Twas but to look into his Constance' eyes, And all was sunshine! Oh, mine own loved Lord, Have I no comfort for thee now! BOUCHARD. Comfort from thee! Ha! ha! why look you, Ladyâyesterday There was a Knight of Flanders, called Bouchard,â A man of proud and unstain'd pedigree, High in his Prince's favourâhigh in honours,â Blestâoh, how blest!âin one he call'd his wife. To-day he is a slaveâa Serfâa bondsman! And 'tis his wife has sunk him! 'tis her hand Has bound his chainsâand now she comes with comfort! CONSTANCE. Oh, thou dost hate me! this I had thought! My unambitious heart knew but to love Thee, not thy station:â'twas enough for me To see thee,âhear thee speak,âto sit by thee,â Walk by thy side,âbreathe the same air thou breathedst, And read each feeling of my heart reflected In a more noble character from thine;â And this I deem'd might still have been our lot In any station, or in any land;â But thou dost hate me! BOUCHARD. Come hither, mistress!ânearer! So, I would look upon thee, and discover Where lies the baseness that has tainted me.â [Gazing on her, then gradually softening.] No! all is still the same as when we loved. CONSTANCE. As when we loved! BOUCHARD. Oh, thou inborn corruption! Thou speck of taint, that leaven'st all the mass So godlike else! where is the sign to know thee? Not on that brow, upon whose polish'd throne So mild a dignity hath ever sat,â That cheek, whose flickering, ever-changing dyes Index'd the artless soul within,âthose eyes That never knew a tear till now, unless For other's woes, wept but to be relieved;â Those lips, that never open'd but to bless,â That never knew to form an unkind wordâ Not even now!âthose lips so often press'd To mine, and breathing in my soul such raptureâ I clung and worshipp'd there!âand now to spurn them! Oh, wretch! infuriate madman! base, most base!â Constance! my love, my own unequall'd wife! Forgive me even here! [Throwing himself into her arms.] CONSTANCE. It is Bouchard!â It is my Lord come back again! BOUCHARD. Constanceâ CONSTANCE. No moreâI would not hear another word,â 'Twas dreadful, but 'tis pastâwe will forget it. BOUCHARD. Thou know'st not how I have been lash'd to frenzyâ Thou know'st not all.âBut there is danger, girl! It tracks upon our heelsâwe must to home,â There is no safety here. CONSTANCE. My father? BOUCHARD. In our stay We but endanger him.âWe must be instant.â I know not if we have not lost e'en now Some moments not to be recall'd. But I was reckless, And cared for nothing, while I loved not thee!â CONSTANCE. Thou'lt grant one word of parting? BOUCHARD. Nay, indeed,â 'Twere but a useless pain. CONSTANCE. Only his blessing! BOUCHARD. It clings for ever round thee! [leading her.] CONSTANCE. I must see him. BOUCHARD. And I must be the sacrifice of all! My safety for a father's kiss!â CONSTANCE [reproachfully.] Bouchard! BOUCHARD. Nay, nay, forgive my selfish wretchedness! I had forgotâthou wilt be better hereâ Stay with thy fatherâthou'lt be more secure, When I am goneâHeaven bless thee! CONSTANCE. Part from thee! Never, Bouchard!âlead where thou wilt, I am thine! BOUCHARD. Wilt share my peril, girl! CONSTANCE. Ay, to the last!â My father! Heaven preserve thy childless path! Lead on, BouchardâI'll followâto the death! [Exeunt. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A Chamber in the Palace of the Earl.âEnter Earl Charles and Thancmar. THANCMAR. My liege, I claim my ownâsay it is true, That his estate is high beyond compare; 'Twill more exalt the power that can reach him.â That were a strange conclusion, which should make The very magnitude of the offence Its plea for pardon. EARL. Tis great minds alone That can afford so greatly. THANCMAR. Therefore, Sire, The greater danger, if they rest uncheck'd.â EARL. Trueâbut Bertulphe has ever served me well, And has most well deserved. THANCMAR. And what of that? He did his duty; the withholding which Had been itself a crime:âyou see not this;â And, let your Highness pardon that I say it, You have so long bent to his towering will, You now shrink from a struggle to be free. EARL. Thancmar, no more of this!âYou would enlist My passions, not my judgment, in your cause. THANCMAR. Then to your justice I appeal, my Lord!â My father, dying, left me gold and lands:â If any man had stolen these away, I would an instant restitution claim, And you allow it. On these lands, my father Left to me also many Serfs and vassals, As truly mine as are your subjects yours:â One out of these escapedâI now have found him, And claim him back again. EARL [sighing.] It must be so! THANCMAR. I claim his children too:â By your own law, who weds a Serf, becomes A Serf himself. I claim Bouchard as mine. EARL. Forego thus much! THANCMAR. Not for the world, my Lord!â Not for the love I bear your princely person, To which this man is dangerous. You learn'd His conduct even nowâhe braved your powerâ He must be made to feel it! That just law Is publish'd, and its tenor known. If he Escape it, men will sayâand say with truthâ Earl Charles the Goodâthe just Earl Charlesâmakes laws To bind the poor alone; the rich break through them;â And the poor citizen, who feels its weight, Will be most foully wrong'd. EARL. True, Thancmar,âtrue! At least he shall have hearing. Let him be Cited before us. THANCMAR. Think you, he will come?â Noâhe will bid you fetch him! Nay, I know That even now, with all his followers, He seeks his castle.âI beseech you, sir, Grant me such force as may command obedience, And let me bring him hither. EARL. Be it so:â If he defies us thus, he is a traitor, And must as such be met. But mark me, Thancmar, I'll have no needless violence;âand if Upon your summons he submit, conduct him With such observance as befits a knight, For he in truth has ever been a brave one. THANCMAR. But if he bid defiance to your orders, I have your licence to enforce obedience With my best judgment. EARL. Yes,âbut use it well. THANCMAR. I'll use it as befits my Prince's honourâ (Aside.) I'll use it, as shall serve my own revenge;â My foot is on him now, and I will crush him! [Exit. EARL. Of all the duties of my busy life, None ever press'd so heavily upon me! But justice must maintain an even scale Though mountains quake, and earth be rent before her. What should be shall be. Enter Bertulphe from a private door. How is this?âBertulphe!â BERTULPHE. 'Tis new, my presence should surprise your Highness! EARL. How came you hither? BERTULPHE. Nay,âthat's stranger still!â Your memory, sir, has undergone much change; And, I do fear, things that with greater weight Than these should dwell there, are as much forgotten. 'Twas you who fix'd my dwelling next your own: And by your own command that door was made, That your beloved and trusty counsellor (As you were wont to call him) might have access At any hour without intruding eyes. EARL. Yesâthat permission was accorded one I deemed a Noble, true and honest man. BERTULPHE. And what am I? EARL. A Serf, whose unmatched boldness Has deck'd him in the mantle of a prince; And who, beneath the mask of stolen honours, Has made his lords his fellows! BERTULPHE. Hard, sharp words From you to me, my liege;âyet I am calm;â I did not come to rail, but reason with you. You call me Serf, and, it may be, presume Some little on the base and abject spirit You think that name betokens.âLet it pass!â You call me Serf.âHow if I should deny The slavish word, and tell of noble names Borne by my father's fathers. EARL. 'Twere in vainâ I have the proofs of your base parentage In my possession. BERTULPHE. An old dotard's ravings, Or papers which a cunning foe might forge. EARL. Yet good until rebutted.âIf indeed You were born noble, bring the public proofs Of your ancestral lineâtheir name, their raceâ The archives of the land that father'd them. BERTULPHE. Playthings for children!âwould I stoop to this, I could buy scores of suchânames for them allâ Titles and goodly deeds to deck them too!â Find cunning scriveners, who, on mouldy parchments, Should draw my pedigree from Charlemagne, Or any musty monarch I would name them;â Nay, I could buy me witnesses as well, Who should come hither from some distant land And swear they knew my father,âwho should be Whate'er I chose to call him!âThey should tell Of marks upon my person,âmoles and stars, By which they'd know me.âTush! my Lord, I have wealth Would buy all thisâay, buy a score of souls To damn themselves to serve meâif I would! EARL. Bertulphe, however low thy parentage, Thy soul was cast in such a noble mould As won my loveâmore than thy services. Thou hast a high and chivalrous spirit in thee That could not stoop to baseness.âNo, Bertulphe, Thou couldst not do these things! BERTULPHE [warmly]. I thank your Highness! You judge me wellâindeed I could not do them; And yet I thank your good opinion of me.â I come to bring you proof that I deserve it.â I need not tell you, sir, I have some power In friends and wealth, that, did I will to use them, Would hold me strong against you,âwould I stain My pure unsullied honour with rebellion.â That will I never! I will but remember We have been friends, and that my heart retains So fondly still that early cherish'd love, I cannot think it banish'd from your own.â Sir, I am come to counsel with your friendship. EARL. I like not this beginning. Yet proceed. BERTULPHE. Then to my friend I freely will confess If e'er my house was noble,âwhich in truth It may have been long sinceâbut if it was, 'Twas all forgotten ere my father's birth. He was a Serfâand yet so good a man, It were my shame if I should blush to own him.â But though I was his sonâMy lord! My lord! I see your darkening brow! It grieves me much That I must then remind you what you owe My father's son. Your proud and ancient line Had miss'd their representative in you But for the aid of my Serf father's child! EARL. I own your merits, and have paid them well; Nor least in this,âthat you are placed so high, You dare thus boldly question with your prince. BERTULPHE. Forgive me!âI was wrongâI had forgot That I must sue forânot demand your grace. Beseech you pardon me:âthe sins of state Have got some hold on me; I have been proud, And play but ill the beggar's part at first. EARL. Thou find'st the recompense thy pride has brought! Thus every springing sin bears in its seed The germ of retribution. Thine ambition, That first did tempt thee to o'erleap thy state, Has been thy guide;âtill now its fatuous light Proves thy destruction. Though I pity thee, I cannot aid. BERTULPHE. Pity, but cannot aid! EARL. Such were my words. Wert thou my Serf, I would enfranchise thee; But, being another's, he must rule thy fate.â Justice has no alternative. BERTULPHE. His Serf!â Justice!âThancmar my fate! Hear this, great Heaven! And 'tis for this I have debased myself!â Humbled my lips to accents of entreaty For this!âThou man without a heart!âThy justice! Thou know'st not justice, save by the cold nameâ A heathen worshipper of a fair image That bears indeed the outward show of beauty, But lacks the inward sense that marks the god!â Stoneâstone to the heart! EARL. What means this daring speech? Within, there! ho! a guard!âHere's treason, sirs! Bertulphe [seizing him by the arm.] Earl Charles, another word and 'tis thy last, For I am desperate! You would expose me!â Make me the gossip of your menials' tongues! There's such a maddening frenzy in my soul, I lose my purpose. But beware, Earl Charles! If there is treason in me, I have yet Enough of vigour in this trembling armâ Enough of fire within this burning brain To make me dangerous!âAh me! ah me! I am a very wretched, weak old man, With all my thoughts entangled!âThere was something I would have saidâand now it flash'd upon meâ And now again 'tis gone: the few last hours Have piled a heap of years upon my head! EARL. Bertulphe, I pardon thee thy folly,âspeak, And I will listen still; and think the past As it had never been. Thou art not thyself,â Collect thee. BERTULPHE [subdued.] 'Twas my child! Sir, I came here Arm'd, as I thought, in coldness and in prideâ But that one word unmans me. My poor childâ My daughter!âshe has been so fondly nursed, And life for her made such a rosy path, This blow will kill her! Sir, you know her fair And youngâyou may have heard too she is good;â But all your knowledge, or your fondest fancy, Could never tell how dear she is to me! Forgive meâI cannot. EARL. Calm thyself! What of thy daughter? BERTULPHE. 'Twere weak to say that I have lived for her: But in whatever I have served your Highness, Which has been something, I beseech you think Yourself her debtor. Oh, my Lordâmy Lord! You would not give, to feed a loathsome canker, The only flower that decks my lonely garden! EARL. What would you ask? BERTULPHE. But little for myself: Yet, for my daughter's sake, I would extend My prayer for leave to seek some foreign land, With means to bear us honourably there,â And we will be the rest to one another. I might ask more, yet I ask only thisâ A few short monthsâand I shall be at rest; And all my fault, if 'twas a fault, die with me.â You hesitate! I have demean'd me, sir, To such an humble prayer as never yet My lips did utter, save to Heaven: yet hear me, And I will not repent my abject phrase. But if, untouch'd, thou still shalt drive me from thee, Then my despairing curse shall ever stand 'Twixt thee and mercy; and, when thou wouldst pray, Stifle thy cry ere it can reach to Heaven. EARL. Still threatening! Did I give my judgment up Into my passion's guidance, thou wouldst make me Thy foe, though purposed to be thy friend;â But I have pardon'd much, and pardon this; And, though thou think'st I bear a heart of stone, I have so much compassion on thy grief, My pity, and remembrance of thy service, Shall warp thus far the line of rigid justice:â Two days are thine;âbestow you as you willâ Go where you willâno man shall question you. But mark! that term expired, and thou in Flanders, Thyself must bear the consequence. BERTULPHE. Content! I will not say I thank you: 'twere too much To give a mockery of thanks for exile; But I will learn to think less hardly of you, And pray to Heaven you may find other servants As faithful as I was; and with no taint Of blood to drive them from you. Fare you well!â No, not your hand, my Lord! It has been taken In friendship oftenâI'll not now pollute it! I cannot yet forget that you have made me The victim of a most ungracious law:â Yet 'tis a lawâthe worse for those who stay To suffer under it. My Lord, farewell! [Exit. EARL. Proud to the last! Oh! thou capricious nature, That such a lofty soul should spring so basely! They lose the most who lose so brave a spiritâ Not thou who bearest thy native worthiness To hallow still thy home in any land. [Exit. SCENE II. A Chamber in the Chateau of Bertulphe. Enter Bertulphe, and flings himself into a chair. BERTULPHE. Soâ'tis decided! and I leave my homeâ My home of many years,âan exileâoutcast!â The luxuries, in which I have grown old, Till they are necessary aids of life;â These noble halls, so long believed my own, With many a sweet remembrance hung about them;â The trees I planted, while I saw in fancy My children's children play beneath their boughs;â My honoursâlet them go!âI keep my child,â That comfort still remains: he grants me that,â His pity grants so muchâpity!âthat's bitter! Bouchard too!âmust I then confess to him That I have sued for pity! [Rising, and pacing up and down.] I dare not do it. I did not feel till now how I am sunkâ Bouchard will spurn me! Why, what devil was it That moved my tongue that I should sue for pity? 'Twas the Serf in me. No!ânoâ'twas the Father! My childâit was for thy dear sake;âand now, 'Tis done, I'll not repent itâ'twas for thee! Enter Bouchard wounded. Why, what is this?âBouchard!âand wounded!âSpeak! What has befallen? Wherefore stand'st thou thus With those glazed eyes and open quivering lips? Hast thou no breathâno sense?âSpeak to me, boy! What has been done? BOUCHARD. My home! my home! BERTULPHE. What of it? Speak, I conjure thee! BOUCHARD. Lost! lost! all lost! BERTULPHE. Hast thou no sense to give thy tale a speech, That thus thou mock'st me with these half-form'd words? BOUCHARD. Yes! and to make thee curse the tongue, that still Retains the power to give such news an utterance!â My castle has been storm'd, destroy'd, and plunder'd! BERTULPHE. By whom? BOUCHARD. By Thancmar,âbut on Charles's warrant. BERTULPHE. Nay, now, I'll not believe it. BOUCHARD. Will you go And see the flames play where it used to stand? BERTULPHE. Can Hell contain such perfidy!âOh, Charles, Thou'lt dearly pay for this!âCome, boy,âfor shame! Droop not!âfor these old walls that thou hast lost, I'll give thee for thy choice the best in Flanders! Rouse thee!âWhere is my daughter?âI will fetch her, And she shall soothe thee. BOUCHARD. Oh, thou poor old man! Wretched!âmost wretched! BERTULPHE. Hast thou more to tell?â My daughter is within? BOUCHARD. Thou'lt seek in vain! She went with me! BERTULPHE. How! left her father's house without his knowledge, And never said farewell!âWhere is my daughter? BOUCHARD. I know not. BERTULPHE. Know not! BOUCHARD. 'Mid the burning ruins I met a hideous thing with maniac eyes, That mouthed and gibber'd at me as I pass'd. BERTULPHE [trembling]. What was it? BOUCHARD. 'Twas thy child, old man! [Bertulphe falls into a chair,] Ay,âgaspâ And if thou hast so much of sense left in thee, Let out thy life, ere thou'rt a minute older In such despair! BERTULPHE [catching at him]. Bouchard!âsheâsheâ BOUCHARD. Ask me no moreâI know not Whence came that fearful thing, or where it went: But when the tottering walls at length fell down, I pray'd that they might cover it! Nay, groan not,â Rather thank Heaven that spared thy shrinking sight That withering horror!âOh, more terrible In its one glance of idiot misery Than all the horrors that did usher it.â BERTULPHE [with sudden calmness]. What is the hour? BOUCHARD. Canst thou inquire of time?â I know not. BERTULPHE. Ho! within there! [Enter Charente.] What's the hour? CHARENTE. The day is breaking, and the Chapel bell Rings its first matin. BERTULPHE. Enough! [Exit Charente.] Marvel not, sir, to see that I am calm;â It is the hour of morning sacrifice, And we must make a matin offeringâ We are the ministering priests to-day; And ours must be a staid and sober bearing.â BOUCHARD. Now, Heaven preserve thy sense! BERTULPHE. Show me your sword,â 'Tis brokenâ[throwing it away] this is of a better temper:â Hold! let me feel your hand.âIs your arm steady? Could it with one strong blow reach to the spot Where the life lurks? BOUCHARD. Oh, that I might but prove it On Thancmar's breast! BERTULPHE [smiling]. Heaven sometimes grants its suppliants Their prayer at the first asking:âneed you aid, You'll find some spirits in these walls Not slow to second you.âMust I add more To urge you, the weapon in your hand?â BOUCHARD [starting, and suddenly clasping Bertulphe's hand]. Bertulphe! I bless thee for that thought! BERTULPHE. Goâyour work waits Rememberâ[stopping him] Thancmar! BOUCHARD. We will meet to-morrow. [Exit. BERTULPHE. Ayâ[watches him out.] 'tis better so.âYesâI should be alone [pauses and mutters to himself]. Heâthat I lovedâhave bled forâwould have died forâ His promiseâtraitor!âHem!âa Serfâand banish'd!â Childlessâay, there! childless! yesâcomeâcomeâcome! [Thrusts his hand into his bosom, as feeling for a dagger, and exit.] SCENE III. Interior of the Church of St. Donatien.âDay-break. Enter Hackel and Albert, meeting Gautier. HACKEL. Gautier! GAUTIER. The sameâyou bade me meet you here. HACKEL. Saw you who passed to yonder oratory? GAUTIER. It was the Earl; there is his favourite shrine, And this the accustom'd hour at which he prays,â 'Twill need a prayer the more for last night's work. HACKEL [sneeringly]. Does Thancmar pray there too? GAUTIER. He parted from him when they reach'd the gate, And turn'd towards home. ALBERT. He must walk warily if he would reach it! Bouchard's abroad. GAUTIER. Indeed! HACKEL. Ay,âand attended. Enter St. Prieux. ST. PRIEUX. Has any seen the Provost? GAUTIER. No, but I do not know the brave old man, If he is long unheard of. They have raised A devil there 'twill take some pains to lay. [Albert to St. Prieux. How seems the city? ST. PRIEUX. Quiet, yet awake!â A pausing thunder-cloud, that only waits To choose where it will strike. None seek their rest; But through the curtain'd casements tapers gleam, That tell the inmates watchers. And anon, A door half-open'd shows some anxious face Intently listening to each distant sound;â And some more bold stand whispering in the streets, But sudden cease when any step approaches. GAUTIER. How stand your friends? ST. PRIEUX. Ready upon the instant, Whenever called. HACKEL. Then why delay we longer? 'Tis plain Bertulphe and his are doom'd already; And that ourselves, his nearest friends,âhis kinsmen,â Bound to him by so many ties!âour ruin Will follow next:âCharles now will keep no termsâ Or he, or we, must fall!âwherefore delay there? GAUTIER. I will not stir without Bertulphe to guide. HACKEL. Nay,âthis is madness. These events have stunn'd him;â Our friends are ready;âthe occasion smiles;â The Earl dreams not of danger. ST. PRIEUX. Yonder Chapel Adjoins the Palace, and will yield an entrance. GAUTIER. Speak lowerâhe is there. ST. PRIEUX. Force then the door, and raise the popular cry Of freedom for the Serfs, and they will join us. Hackel to Gautier. Art still irresolute? [The tocsin sounds, and distant cries are heard. Ha!âthat alarm! What can it mean? ALBERT. It is Bouchard;âprofit by the occasion, And act at once,â[a distant groan]âHush!â[a pause] 'Tis begun already,â Death is at work. HACKEL to Albert. Quick!âraise our friends without. [Exit Albert and St. Prieux. Now, Gautier, will you follow me? GAUTIER. I will!â Bertulphe our rallying word,âour cry for vengeance. Enter Bertulphe. BERTULPHE. 'Tis gain'd!â I sought it in the bosom of my friend, And found it there! [Slowly drawing a dagger from under his cloak. HACKEL. What's this? BERTULPHE. The Earl is dead! I slew himâin the sanctuary, at the altar!â There was no sanctuary from a father's vengeance!â I loved him once,ânow, all I loved are dead: And Bertulphe, like a sear and fallen leaf, With not a branch to own him, may be whirl'd, The unresisting sport of every wind. Enter Charente. CHARENTE. My Lord, I have sought you. All within your palace Is consternation, sore dismay, and grief!â The Lady Constanceâ BERTULPHE. Peace!âI know it all. CHARENTE. Her shrieking women weep and tremble round her. BERTULPHE. Round her? Is then herâbodyâfound? CHARENTE. My Lord!âher body? She lives. BERTULPHE [wildly.] Lives!âConstance lives! CHARENTE. She is within. BERTULPHE. Constance within?âalive! Constance returned?âmy child alive!â[trembling]âand well? CHARENTE. Unharm'd in person, but her delicate senseâ Alas! alas!âquite overthrown and wreck'd. BERTULPHE. But yet she lives!âyou said she was alive? CHARENTE. My Lord, she is. BERTULPHE. Then bring me,âbring me to her! These poor weak, trembling limbs! [bursts into tears. Enter St. Prieux and Albert. ST. PRIEUX. Why do you loiter here? BERTULPHE. My child's alive! ST. PRIEUX. The city favours us,âthe Serfs have risen. ALBERT. Thancmar is fled,âBertulphe, your presence now Will stamp our conquest certain,âshow yourself. BERTULPHE. Ay!âbut my child!âwhere is she? HACKEL. Nay, but hear me! BERTULPHE. I hear nothing but my child! She calls me!âI will see her!âbring me to her. [Exit, supported by Charente. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. A Street in Bruges.âEnter Bouchard, St. Prieux, and Albert. BOUCHARD. Nothing is gained while Thancmar is alive. ST. PRIEUX. Yet still we have done gloriously;âthe city Is all our own; no public officer But has sworn fealty to us.âThey who first Did waver, soon o'erawed by our bold front, And by the daring of the mighty deed, Have all submitted, and no man in Bruges But hails us for his masters. Surely this Is much;âwhat would you further? BOUCHARD. Thancmar! Thancmar!â He has escaped, and all the rest is worthless; But he will come againâthere's balm in that! Oh! I will welcome him With a more close embrace than ever yet Did lover his lost mistress! ALBERT. Yet be calm And take your needful rest. BOUCHARD. I willâI will.â Had I been calm before, I had not missed him!â But oh! St. Prieux, thou didst not know the war Of this poor brain!âI have sat in the deep midnight, Watching the workings of approaching frenzy, And as the horrid images arose, I laugh'dâand long'd to be all mad! And then I saw my wifeâsuch as she used to beâ That pure and gentle, loving, tender girl;â I saw her innocent smileâpoor thing! poor thing! And then I did not laughâbut weptâweptâwept! And so the fever passed. ST. PRIEUX [affectionately]. Will you not home? BOUCHARD. Home! where?âwhere is my home? Is it the chamber WhereâHell! I cannot name itâwhere the old man Through day and night watches beside his child, Muttering sad thoughts, and sunk beyond the reach Of hope or care? Oh! that I were so too!â But it is denied to me;âmy burning blood Still rushes onward through its parch'd-up channels, Drying the source of lifeâbut not of pain. [Distant shouts and cries.] Enter Messenger. ST. PRIEUX. What means that outcry? MESSENGER. By a sudden effort The northern gate is forcedâthe guard is fledâ And Thancmar with the chamberlain and Hebert Leads troops into the city. BOUCHARD [drawing his sword]. Thancmar! ALBERT [holding him]. Hush!â Do none oppose him? MESSENGER. Nay, they rather hail him. BOUCHARD. He is come! Thancmar is come! You said the northern gate? ST. PRIEUX. You shall not seek him. BOUCHARD. How! ST. PRIEUX. 'Twas thus before,â Your eagerness defeated your intent.â Remember, Thancmar is enclosed by thousands, And half the city interposed between you;â You are aloneâyour troops are all shut up;â Had you a hundred lives, you'd waste them all Before you reach'd him. Enter Second Messenger. ALBERT. Now,âyour tidings, sirrah? SECOND MESSENGER. The Palace-gates are closed, and crowds collect there With threatening gestures, crying for the Provost And Sir Bouchard;âwe soon shall be beset. ALBERT to Bouchard. Your course is plainâto gain at once the palace; Or soon, cut off from all resource, the crowd Will crush you unavenged. There wait your foe, And, as occasions offer, choose your own. BOUCHARD [irresolute]. Which way makes vengeance surest? ST. PRIEUX. To the Palace! BOUCHARD. Albert,âSt. Prieux,âyou counsel this,âI yield; But mark me,âif by this my foe escape, I'll think you Thancmarâand your blood shall be To me in place of his.âCome! to the Palace! [Exeunt. SCENE II. A chamber in the Chateau of Bertulphe.âConstance on a couch asleep.âBertulphe watching her. BERTULPHE. She sleeps,âher body sleeps,âand every vein Through her transparent skin throbs as it used;â But the pure mindâthe all-informing soul, That gave that form its worthâwhere does that sleep, That all a father's agony of love Calls after it in vain? With but a touch I can recall their functions to those limbs:â The eyes shall see, ears hear, and even the lips Murmur their poor, sad, unconnected sounds; But oh! thou glorious soul, where art thou fled?â That all my tears, my prayers, and frenzied cries Cannot awake one touch of thee? Poor flower! So delicate and fragile in thy beauty, The earliest blast that touched thee, blighted thee!â What's that? There was a thrill of pain shot o'er her brow! Oh, cruel! cannot even madness rest!â Yet stay! What if it be returning sense! How if the soul in this long heavy sleep Clear off its mistsâand the entangled thoughts, Soothed by their rest, resume their wonted course! Oh, Heaven! that I can say such things may be, And yet delay to prove them! There, again! That fierce contraction! Though it blast my hope, I'll dare it! [taking her hand] Constance! Child! CONSTANCE [rising.] Father!â BERTULPHE [trembling.] She knows me!â CONSTANCE. I thought you would not leave me.âTake me home!â BERTULPHE [with extasy.] 'Tis sense! 'tis sense!âmy child's restored to me. [sinks sobbing on the couch.] CONSTANCE. Tears!âNayâthat's folly.âLet the Serfs shed tears!â The poor old manâBertulpheâhe may shed tearsâ But you that are a proud and reigning prince, The Earl of Flandersâyou to weep!âfor shame! BERTULPHE [sinking.] Oh, noâ'tis madness still! CONSTANCE. Did they not say The old man had a daughter! Let her die! Poor fool!âwhy should she mate with princes? BERTULPHE [in agony.] Constance!â Child! idol of a life of many cares! Look on me!âThereâyou know me! 'Tis your Fatherâ Your own dear Father!âThere's a consciousness Struggling to win its way through the dark mist.â She yet will know me.âConstance! it is I!â What but a father's eyes could pour these drops So hot and fast!âwhat but a father's arms Circle thee with such idolizing love! Constance!âI shall go madâturn from my face Those dull, unmeaning eyes; their vacancy Is worse than frenzy!âthou art not my child! Thou spectral thing!âtake off that stony gazeâ I say thou'rt not my child.âAway with thee! CONSTANCE. Hark! noâ'twas nothingâyet it sounded like The tread of men.âWhat!âto a prison!âNay, Yield, yield, Bouchardâthey will not harm usâyield!â The gates are crashingâhark!âthey comeâthey come!â What's that?â'tis bloodâha! they've struck him down! Ruffian, away! Bouchard! Oh! save meâsave me!â These are my father's arms! [clings round him.] You dare not harm me now. BERTULPHE. Heaven's mercy's spent, And 'tis the hour of vengeance! 'Tis for this That I have lived, wrought, plann'dâit may be, sinn'd;â For this!âand this must have no end till death! To-morrow as to-dayâthe next the sameâ Weeks, months, long years, an age, grey hairs of madness! Perhaps to sink in want when I am gone, And live on pity, or it may be malice, To feast more loyal eyes with, the last wreck Of Serf Bertulphe, the Regicide! [seeing his hand on his dagger] Why so!â[looking at her, and convulsively clutching the hilt.] A moment and all's over! Perhapsâperhapsâ[suddenly flinging away the dagger, falling on his knees, and clasping his hands.] Helpâhelpâand spare me, Heaven! [starting up.] Within! within, there! ho! quick!âquick! within! Enter Ursula and attendants. Why came you not before?âtake her away! I call you to witness she is safeâ I have not harm'd herâHeaven be praised I have not! URSULA. Harm'd her! the saints defend us! Harm the child! Look how she clings to me, and how she trembles! Enter Charente. CHARENTE. My Lordâmy Lordâyour presence is besoughtâ The city's in commotionâcrowds collectâ And all tongues cry for you. Your friends are scared, And waver at their posts. BERTULPHE [abstractedly.] Wellâ CHARENTE. The Earl's name Is now on all men's lipsâthe city gates Are weakly kept. BERTULPHE [as before.] Wellâ CHARENTE. Dear my Lord!âyour friends Are met in council, and beseech your presence. BERTULPHE. What's ill? I did not mark your taleâwhat is it? Enter Gautier. GAUTIER. All's lost without you!âwe are now beset! Thousands are gathering round, and every instant They threaten an attack on the Chateau! Bertulphe! will this not move you? BERTULPHE [coldly.] Noânot now!â Sweep on, ye fiery elements of strife!â I have no portion in you now. To me, A tree already struck, it matters little Which way the tempest rollsâ[a trumpet heard.] What's that? [sharply.] GAUTIER. Your foes! They sound defiance at your very gates; They claim you for their vengeanceâclaim all yours, Bertulphe! Chief!âleader! the Chateau is strong With many a valiant heart within its wallsâ Men led to this by youâdrawn by your actâ Who still hold cheap their lives to do you serviceâ They only ask a leader. BERTULPHE [with energy.] They shall have it! GAUTIER. It is yourself they askânone elseâ BERTULPHE. I come!â Where is Bouchard? GAUTIER. Providing for all chancesâ Fierce as the wounded lionâwhile his tongue At every pause cries out afresh for vengeance. BERTULPHE. He shall not cry in vain!âtell them I come!â My arms there!âsay I come! GAUTIER. I will, brave spirit! [Exit. BERTULPHE. My arms!âa helmet!â[turning round, sees Constance.] Oh poor blustering fool! A helmet for the head would bless the hand That sent an arrow quivering to its brain! No,âno,âI will no helmet! These grey hairs, Stream'd in the breeze, shall be my banner, guiding Their hottest fire.âNoânoâI will no helmet! My child!âpoor wreck of what was once my childâ One kiss. Oh that we were both at our rest! Disturb her notâthe fit has pass'd away, And she is calmâso would I have her be. My child!âI'd breathe a blessing on thy head;â But should I give my prayer a tongue, the word, Methinks, would be thy death! Away! away! SCENE III. A Gallery in the Chateau.âAlarms. Enter Albert. ALBERT. Where is Bertulphe? So many throng withoutâ Each minute brings its thousand, till their numbers Baffle all skill. Enter St. Prieux. ST. PRIEUX. Albert, the assault is made! ALBERT [going.] Ha! ST. PRIEUX. Nay, 'tis over! At first they bore us backâhad gain'd the wall, And all seem'd desperate; when the old Provost Rush'd with such noble fury in the midst, Encouraging the while, with voice and action, The falt'ring troops, that none could stand before him; And fortune, even from habit, following him, Restored all we had lost. ALBERT. The brave old man! I'll join him instantly. [Exit. Enter Charente. CHARENTE. The Provost! ST. PRIEUX. Nowâwhat new? CHARENTE. In the left wing, where we had little force, A lodgment has been made. Enter Bouchard. BOUCHARD. Who leads the assault? CHARENTE. Thancmar. BOUCHARD. Then let him enter! Ill betide The man who stops his way! Room,âroom for Thancmar! He comes! The fiend who guides him in his course Now leads him to his fate! [Enter Thancmar.] Secure the doors, And he who dares to rob me of a blow, I'll turn my sword on him the next. Now, Thancmar, At last we are met. I have no words for curses; It is enough I am Bouchard! And yet I bid thee guard thee wellâmy thirsting blade Will else at once leap to thy heart, and so Shorten my vengeance. I would have thee pour A separate life from every felon limb And linger to destruction. THANCMAR. Serf and rebel! Here is my only answer. [Attacks him.âExeunt fighting. Enter Gautier. GAUTIER. There is no hope! ST. PRIEUX. That will I not believe While that untameable old man holds out. GAUTIER. When he can multiply His single self, and station a Bertulphe At every point on which the assailants press, Then will I too cry hope,âbut not till then. Enter Bertulphe. BERTULPHE. Who says there is no hope? Sir Gautier! Shame! I had deem'd better of you. Had a soldier Said this, I would have hurl'd him from the walls To show that we could spare him. What! no hope! There ISâthere shall be hope! My child!âmy child! What shall thy fate be? [Alarms.] Hark! they come again. Who's there? St. Prieux, take you some men-at-arms And drive them o'er the wallâleave not a manâ Then come to me again. [Exit St. Prieux. GAUTIER. 'Tis a vain struggle! BERTULPHE. Gautier, I charge thee, do not reason with me! My heart and brain are all so wildly jarr'd, It little lacks of madness.âGive me action, Noise, blows, the conflictâto fill all my soul, And leave no space for thought.âCome!âto the walls! Enter Bouchard.âHe throws a sword at Bertulphe's feet. BOUCHARD. There!âfeast thine eyes on that! BERTULPHE. What is it? BOUCHARD. Blood From Thancmar's heart! [sinks on the ground.] BERTULPHE. But thou, Bouchardâthou art hurt! BOUCHARD. Ayâpast all remedyâ BERTULPHE [rushing to him.] Noânoânoâthou art notâ Thou shalt not die, Bouchardâmy childâshe loves you! Look upâ'tis but the loss of bloodâthereâthere! BOUCHARD. Wretched old man! I seek no further life!â For theeâfarewell!âI pityâandâforgive thee! [Dies. BERTULPHE. Dead!âwho shall tell her this? Why now indeed Madness is mercyâfor she will not know it!â She must not know itâshe would curse her father! My childâmy poor lost child! [shriek without.] URSULA [without.] Woe! woe! GAUTIER. What cry is that? URSULA [entering.] Oh, wretched father! Father no longer nowâshe's dead! she's dead!â BERTULPHE. Dead!âwhy I'm glad on'tâHa! ha! ha!âto hear A doting father told his child is dead And cry, I'm glad on't!â Now I defy thee, Fate! for I am freeâ I did but bear this load of life for her, And now I cast it from me. GAUTIER. My brave, my wretched kinsman! BERTULPHE. Thou there, old comrade!âThou hast bravely foughtâ So have you all.âGo now, and make your peaceâ 'Twill readily be granted when you tell them Bertulphe submits, and is their prisoner. GAUTIER. Never, while I have life! BERTULPHE. Fear nothing. [a crash without.] Hark! They come! GAUTIER. Bertulphe, I'll die defending you! [Exit. BERTULPHE. Soâto receive them, [Walks slowly up the stage; as he passes the body of Bouchard, stops and gazes mournfully. Husband of my child! They shall not find thee thusâI will compose Thy noble limbs with fitting decency. [Kneels beside the body.] Did time permit, I'd place her by thy side, Uniting you in death, as three months since I joined you at the altar, while I watched Your fond eyes beaming love upon each other, And blessed you soâand thought I saw begun The long, long line should make Bertulphe immortal, While my heart proudly saidâI have done this. [Starting up]. Yes! yes! I have done this! blighted you both, Fair blossoms of such promiseâ'twas my work! Be quick,âbe quickâmy foes, and end this torture Ere my heart burst! [Noise without.] [The besiegers drive in the followers of Bertulphe and fill the stage.] HEBERT. Yield thee,âregicide!â BERTULPHE [calmly.] See! I am here!âWill you not fetch your captive? Why gaze you thus as on some prodigy? It is Bertulphe!âthat dares you to the lastâ That stands alone before you all! What would you? HEBERT. Thy lifeâfor outraged justice, thou bold rebel!â Thou Serf! BERTULPHE. Serfâha! I knew 'twas there it gall'd you! The Serf has ruled you,âcurb'd your restive spirits,â Urged on your trembling flag to victory,â Rode the top wave in all your storms of state, And overwhelm'd you when you would unseat him; And still, even now, that you stand circling round him With malice open-mouth'd, craving for vengeanceâ Still to the last he is above your reach And mocks youâeven thus. [Stabs himself. GAUTIER [springing to him.] Bertulphe!âmy friend! BERTULPHE. Good soulâ'twas well done! [Raising himself.] Dogs! I am no Serf. [Dies. THE END.</field>
