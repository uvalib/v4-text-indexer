      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGVS CHAMVS. Begin, thou royall Muse, Enuie nere vses, To dwell in gentle Courts, or sacred Muses: To begge of them that common courtesie Must grant; were to condemne both them, and thee: Thy Came assures thee, they will all agree, Gently to beare their Actors infancy; Infants oft please; the choycest Poet song, Breeds lesse delight then th' infants prattling tongue. Then let me here intreate your minds to see, In this our England, fruitfull Sicely, Their two twinne Iles; so like in soyle and frame, That as two twinnes they'r but another same. But this they begge, which you may graunt with ease: That all these paines to pleasure you, may please.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Scen. 1. Enter Perindvs, Armillvs, Cvma. Perindus. Cvma! beare home our spoyles, and conquering weapons, And trusse them on a wreath as our iust trophie: And when Cancrone returnes, returne to mee. Exit Cuma Thus: if but thus: yet thus my state is better, While lesser cares do laugh and mocke the greater; This change is best when changing I frequent, Euen now that moyst, now this drie element, When with this scepter, setting on the Land, The scalie footlesse people I command: When riding on my wooden horse, I see The Earth that neuer mooues, remooue from me. And why my friend doth not this guise beseeme me? In this I am not wretchlesse as you deeme me. Ar. Not that I censure, but demande the cause, Why being borne, and bred, in shepheards lawes; You haue our Hills, and Downes, and Groues forsaken, And to these Sands, and Waues your selfe betaken. Per. Shepheard or fisher, I am still the same, I am a sea guest not for gaine, but game. Ar. A gamesome life? thus with vnarmed armes To fight gainst windes, and winters sharpe alarmes, And paddle in chill Neptuns Icie lappe? But if in fishing any plesaure be, In Shepheards life there is much more say we. Per. Yet Fishers life with me doth most consort, This sporting serues to moralize my sport: Viewing the stormes, and troublesome waues; I finde Some thing in nature rest-lesse as my minde: Each captiue fish tels me that in deaths snare, My heart is not the onely prisoner. Ar. Walke along the shoreâ Oft there he walkes Oft there with me or with the waues hee talkes. Per. There in the tide I see fleete fortunes changing, And state of man, weake state: that's neuer standing: But rises still, or fals all as the maine, That ebs to flow, or flowes to ebbe againe. Yet fortune I accuse thee not for raging, Let others plaine, I neuer felt the changing, But wast thou at the first, and so art still, Before I knew what's good I knew the ill: And since of all my goods thou first bereau'st me, I neere expected good, thou neere deceiud'st me; Therefore although Oracle from whence I late ariu'd, would feede vaine confidence; Yet since so sure assurance thou doest giue mee, Still of the two fortune I must beleeue thee. Ar. Vaine feare when th' Oracle doth promise good; The heauens decrees by chance weere neere withstood. You feare without a cause, oft cause-lesse fright, Is th' onely cause that makes that on vs light Which most wee feare, euer a iealous eye Makes enemies by fearing emnity. Per. What fearefull tempest doe the waues foretell, When seas without a storme to mountaynes swell. Ar. Ill is inuited when it is suspected And griefe already come where he's expected. Per. The greatest euills oft are where thee shew not, I feare the more, because my feare I know not. Musicke! how sad it sounds; my damped heart Tells me in these sad straines I beare a part: I wrong thee fate, or else thou now doest straine thee Which some vnused welcome t' entertaine me. Scen. 2. Enter DicÃ¦us Neptunes Priest following Olinda, led by two Nymphes Cosma and Glaucilla, before and after a Chorus of Fishers and Priests singing. Song. Go go thy countries ioy and iewell, The seas and rockes were euer cruell; Men then may pitty thee in vaine, But not helpe nor ease thy payne. Take then these tnares they lacest due, For euer now alasse adiew. Olin. Glaucus; to thee I frendlesse maide, In these last gifts my vowes haue payd: These once Olindas, now are thine, This net, and hooke, this rod, and line: Thou knowst, why here my sports I giue thee, Hence came my ioyes, and here they leaue me. Gla. Olinda, if that smiles were proofes of sorrow, Sure I should thinke thee full of woe, and sadnesse, but in so heaped griefe, when euery eye Yeilds tribute to so great a misery. Thou only smilst, why euery teare thou seest, is paid to theeâ Olin. The lesse I need to pay: Gladucilla I cannot mourne, when I am married. Gla. Married? now heauen defend me, if this be marriage, So to be gript in pawes of such a monster, And bedded in his bowellsâ Cos. Olinda I should weepe, And spend the short'nd breath that fate affords me, In cursing fate which makes my breath so short. Olin. Peace peace my Cosma, thou wouldst Haue me mad with reason! Cos. No: reason is neuer sencelesse. Olin. Thinkst thou me sence lesse friend? Gla. Dost not thou proue it? Olin. Why my Glaucilla I see thy drowned eyes, I feele thy kinde imbracements, and which thou seest not, Nor feelst, I feele and see, more mirth and ioy Spring in my heart; then if I now were leading To the best bed that Sicely affords me. Glaucilla if there were but fit occasion That I might shew thee this tormented heart, It would affright thee friend to heare me tell How many deaths liue in so narrow Hell. DecÃ¦. We stay too long; goe on these idle teares Quench not her griefe, but adde new kindled feares. Olen. DecÃ¦us; no feare within this brest is lying. Who liuing dies, feares not to liue by dying. Exeunt ad rupem rufam manent reliqui. Scen. 3. Enter Perindus, Armillus. Ar. Saw you the troope which past along here? Per. Yes. Ar. Who is it ledde with such a mournfull show? Per. My sister. Ar. Who the faire Olinda? Per. Yes: Ar. And doe you know the end and purpose? Per. No: Ar. Nothing but no and yes? fie fie Perindus Your too much passion, shewes you want affection; Your sister in such sort conuey'd, and you So carelesse of her griefe? it much misseemes you Why learne you not the cause? Per. Thou counsailst well, Griefe weary of it selfe, all sence depriuing. Felt neyther sence, nor griefe, by ouergrieuing: Enter Atyches. But see my Atyches: what different passions Striue in his doubtfull face, pitty would weepe, And danger faine would rocke high thoughts a sleepe, Whiles resolution chides the daring feare, And courage makes poore feare afrade to feare. Atych. Thou God that rulst the sunnes bright flaming cart If thou my grand-sire art, as sure thou art For in my breast I feele thy powers diuine, Firing my soule, which tels mee I am thine: Direct my hand and guide this poynted dart, That it may peirce, and riue the monsters heart. Per. Atyches. Atych. Ah Perindus this lucklesse howre Bids thee vnwelcome, fly and neuer more, Neuer approach to view this deadly shore. Per. Why whats the newes? Atych. Thy sister the fayre Olinda must die. Ar. So must we all. Atych. But none of all as she. Per. Canst tell the cause and manner? Atych. yes; and till the sunne Twixt noone and night his middle race shall runne, The rites will not be finisht; 'tis briefly thus. Thou knowst by Neptunes temple close their growes A sacred garden, where euery flowers blowe: Here blushing roses, there the Lillies white, Here Hyacinth, and there Narcissus bright: And vnderneath, the creeping violets show: That sweetness oft delights to dwell below: Vaulted aboue with thousand fragrant trees, And vnder pa'ud with shamefast Strawberies, Which creeping lowe doe sweetely blushing tell, That fairest pleasantst fruits, doe humblest dwell. Breifly a little Heauen on Earth it seemes: where euery sweete and pleasure fully streames. Ar: Fisher thou now describ'st some paradice, Can any ill from so much good arise? Atych: Henbane and roses in our garden growe, Ah that from fruits so sweete, such gall should flowe! Here faire Olinda, with her Mymphs arriues, And time away, time to fast posting driues, While Nago that deformed enchanter, ranging Along these trees, his shape and habit changing Seem'd then Glaucilla, such his statelike eyes, Such haire, such lipps, such cheekes, such rosie dies, So like Glaucillas selfe that had shee spide him, More would shee doubt her selfe, the more shee eyd him Ar. Can art forge nature with so true a lie? Atych. The falsest coine is fairest to the eie, Singling thy sister forth, they chance to see, The sacred graft of that Herperian tree, Whose golden apples much the eye delighting, Would tempt the hands: the longing tast inuiting: And now the subtill witch spies fit occasion, And with fitte speech and oaths, and soft perswation, So words hee mind; that shee (ha little guessing, What monster lay vnder that faind dressing, Puls of th' vnhappie fruit straight downe shee falls, And thrice a thundring voice DicÃ¦us calls; The preist knew what the fearefull voice portended, And faire Olinda halfe dead apprehended: And to the temple beares her, there reseruing Till the third day with death payes her deseruing So Neptune, bids, that who shall touch the tree. With hands profane, shall by Malorcha die; Malorcha bread in seas, yet seas do dread him, As much more monstrous then the seas that bred him Per. Ah my Olinda who can pitty thee That wouldst not pitty th' excellent Thalander. 'Tis iust yee seas well doth impartiall fate With monstrous death punish thy monstrous hate. And whither art thou now thus armed going. Atych. Downe to the fatall rocke I goe to see And act a part in this foule Tragedy. Per. Why canst thou hope such losses to repayre? Atych. Who nothing hopes yet nothing ought despaire. Per. What 'tis impossible? ah cease to proue? Atych. What euer was impossible to loue? Per. 'Tis certaine thou adst thy death to hers Atych. Vnworthy loue that life for loue prefers Per. What good canst do when thou canst not restore her. Atych. to liue with her or else to die before her. Per. 'Tis fate that in this monster bids engraue her. Atych. And 'tis my fate to die with her or saue her. Per. In vaine to fight against all conquering Ioue: Atyoh. But in my hand shall fight Ioue conquering loue. Per. Atyches why shouldst thou thus betray thy selfe? She was my sister, and as deare to me As euer was a sister to a brother: Had fate felt any hope, my willing hand Should be as Prest to giue her ayd as any. Were not the fight gainst heauen I might aduenture, But here I needs must leaue her, though a brother She neuer loued mee. Atych. I lou'd her euer. Per. More shouldest thou hate her now: Atych. Can Seas or Riuers stand can Rocks remooue? Could they? yet could I neuer cease to loue: Perindus, if now I see thee last, farewell: Within thy breast all ioyes and quiet dwell. Adiew: Olinda now to thee I flye For thee I liu'd, for thee i'le gladly die, Exit Atyches. Per. Goe choycest spirit: the heauenly loue regard thee, And for thy loue, with life, and loue reward thee. Scen. 4. Enter Perindus, Armillus. Ar. Perindus thou knowst how late was my arriuall, And short abode in this your Sicely, And how delighted with these accidents So strange and rare, I haue decreed to make Some longer stay, but since I saw this Atyches His loue more strong then death, a resolution Beyond humanity I much desir'd To know him, what he is, and what his country That breeds such minds: let me intreate you then At large to giue me all this story Somewhat t'will east your griefe, iust are his paines That sorrow with more sorrow entertaines. Per. It will be tedious, and my heauy minde Fit words for such a tale can neuer finde: Yet I'le vnfold it all, that you may see How beautious loue showes in inconstancy: Who hath not heard of Glaucus loue? haplesse Whilst fairest Scylla baths him, loue inspires At once herselfe she cooles and him she fires. A sea god burnt in flames, and flames most please him Glaucus findes neither waues nor hearbes to ease him Cold were his eyes more cold her coy disdaine: Yet none of boeth could quench loues schorching flame: Till Circe whom scornd loue to madnes moues Quenches at once her beautie and his loues. There stands shee now a proofe of iealous spite As full of horror now as then delight: Ar. The fruite of iealousie is euer curst, But when tis grafted in a crab tis worst. Bad in a man, but monstrous in a woman, And which the greater monster hard to know Then ielous Circe, or loath'd Scylla now After when time had easd his greife for Scylla, Circe with charmes, and prayers and gifts had wone him Her loue shee reapt in that high rocky frame, Which euer since hath borne faire Circes name: The Moone her fainting light 10 times had fed, And 10 times more her globe had emptied: When two fayre twins she brought, whose beauteous shine, Did plainly proue their parents were diuine. The male Thalander, the female calld Glaucilla, And now to youth arriu'd so faire they are That with them but themselues who may compare, All else excelling; each as faire as other Thus best compard the sister with the brother. Ar. So liuely to the eare thy speeches show them, That I must halfe affect before I know them. Per. Vaine words that thinke to blase so great perfection, Their perfectnes more proues words imperfection. But if these words some little sparkle moue, How would their sight inflame thy soule with loue? Scarce did his haire betray his blooming yeares, When with his budding youth his loue appeares, My selfe and sister equally he loues, And as on those two poles heauen euer moues So on vs two his soule still fixt, still louing Was euer constant, by his constant mouing: Yet neuer knew wee which was most respected, Both equally and both he most affected. In mee his worthy loue with iust reflexion, Kindled an equall and a like affection, But shee my sister most vngratefull maide, With hate, ah hatefull vice, his loue repaide. Ar: Cea'st he not then to loue? this sure wee hold That loue not backe reflected soone grows cold. Per: No though all spite within her bosome sweld, Spite of her spite his loue her hate exceld; At length to shew how much he was neglected, His riuall vgly riuall shee affected: Such riuall could I wish whose foule distortion, Would make seeme excellent a meane proportion, For Mago, thus his hated riuall's nam'd) All blacke and foule, most strang and vgly fram'd Begot by Saturne, on a sea-borne witch, Resembling both, his haires like threeds of pitch Distorted feete, and eyes suncke in his head: His face dead pale, and seem'd but moouing lead Yet worse within, for in his heart to dwell His mothers furies haue their darkest hell. Yet when Thalander woo'd her, shee neglects him, And when this monster flatterd shee respects him. Ar: I'st possible. troth Sir but that I feare mee, If I should speake some women should ore: heare mee: Mee thinks I now could raile on all their kinds, But who can sound the depth of womens minds? Per. Shortly to come to'th' height of all their wrong, So could this Mago fill his smoothest tongue, That shee Thalander banisht from her sight, Neuer to see her more his sole delight: And he to none his hidden greife in parted, But full of louing duty straight departed Leauing our groues in woods he grows a ranger To all but beasts and sencelesse trees a stranger. Thus in a desert like his loue forsaken When no hing but cold death his flames could slacken Atyches spyed him, but so griefe had pin'd him. That when he saw him plaine, he could not find him. And so had sorrow all his graces rest That in him, of him nothing now was left Onely his loue; with which his latest breath He power'd into his eares, so slept in death. The rest when better leisure time affords This lucklesse day askes rather teares then words. Exeunt, CHORVS. Who neere saw death, may death commend, Call it ioyes Prologue troubles end: The pleasing sleepe that quiet rockes him, Where neither care; nor fancy mockes him. But who in neerer space doth eye him, Next to hell, as hell defye him: No state, no age, no sexe can moue him, No beggars prey, no Kings reprooue him: In mid'st of mirth, and loues alarmes, He puls the Bride from Bridegroomes arms The beautous Virgin he contemnes, The guilty with the iust condemns. All weare his cloth and none denyes. Dres't in fresh colour'd liueries. Kings lewe as beggars lie in graues, Nobles as base, the free as slaues, Bles't who on vertues life relying, Dies to vice, thus liues by dying. But fond that making life thy treasure, Surfetst in ioy, art drunke in pleasure. Sweetes do make the sower more tart. And pleasure sharp's deaths keenest dart. Deaths thought is death to those that liue, In liuing ioyes, and neuer grieue. Happelesse that happie art and knowst no teares Who euer liues in pleasure, liues in feares Exit.

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Scen. 1. Enter Conchylio solus. I haue bene studying, what bold hardie foole Inuented fishers art, that tir'd with safety, Would needs go play with waues, winds, death and hell, The summe of fishers life is quickly found, To sweate, freeze, watch, fast toyle be starud or drownd. Well had my Mistris found no better trade, I would ere this haue left these dabling deities, But she while other fishers fish on the seas, Sends me a fishing on the Land for flesh: No, game arriue's amisse vnto her net, For shees not borne among the cliffs, and rockes But from Messena comes to sport herselfe And fish for fooles along these craggie shores, I tooke her for a Nymph, but shees a woman A very woman loueth all she sees, This for his sprightly wit, and that for Musicke, Him cause hee's faire, another for his blacknesse Some for their bashfulnes, more for their boldnesse, The wiseman for his silence, the foole for his bibble babble; And now she longs in haste for another fat cods-head, A good fat sow, and I must snare one for her She has (let me see I haue the tallie) Some hundred louers, yet still desires another The first that passeth all the rest in loue Is called Pas: Hah know you your cue so well? Enter Pas. He is a malum collum, alas poore foole; He would engrosse my Mistris to himselfe He would haue her all alone, let her alone for that And for that it will not be, he raues and sweares And chides and fights, but what neede I describe him Hee'l doe't himselfe, come, begin begin. Scen. 2. Pas Conchylio. Pas. Who sowes the seas, or plowes the easy shore? Yet I, fond I more fond, and sencelesse more: Who striues in nets to prison in the winde? Yet I in loue a woman thought to bind: Fond, too fond thoughts, that thought in loue to tie, One more inconstant then inconstancy: Looke as it is with some true Aprill day, The sunne his glorious beames doth fayre display, And straight a clowd breakes into fluent showres, Then shines and raines, and cleares and straight it lowres: And twenty changinges in one houre do proue, So, and more changing is a womans loue. Fond then my thoughts, that thought a thing so vaine, Fond loue, to loue what could not loue againe. Fond hopes, that anchor on so false a ground, Fond thoughts that fir'd with loue, in hope thus drownd: Fond thoughts, fond hope, fond heart, but fondest I, To graspe the winde, and loue inconstancy. Ah Cosma, Cosma. Exit Con. Ah Pas, asse passing asse; hah, ha, he: Fond thoughts, fond hope, fond heart, but fondest I, To graspe the winde, and loue inconstancy; ha, ha, he, This foole would haue I know not what, the sea To stand still like a pond, the Moone neuer to change, A woman true to one hee knowes not what: She that to one all her affections brings Cages herselfe and pinions Cupids wings. Let's see whose the second; O the second Is an old dotard who though now foure score Yet nature hauing left him some few hot embers Rack't vp in cold ashes, thinkes himselfe all fire and flame And therefore like the dwarfes Who though neere so old, yet still consort with boyes So he among the freshest youth in dancing In songs and sporting spends his fadish time. When snow on's head, showes in his eye With winter lookes giues summer words the lye His name is Fredocaldo; he knowes his name Enter Fredocaldo. No sooner cald but comes! what i'st he reads? Vpon my life some sonner, Ile stand and heare. Scen. 3. Fredocaldo Conhilio. Fre. I, I am siluer white so is thy cheeke Yet who for whitenes will condemne it? If wrinkled, of thy forehead is not sleeke Yet who for frowning dare contemne it. Boys full of folly youth of rage Both but a iourney to old age I am not yet fayre Nymph to old to loue And yet woemen loue old louers Nor yet to wauing light, as false to proue youth a foule inside fairely couers. Yet when my light is in the waine Thy sunnes renew my spring againe. Pretty very pretty, why yet I see My braine is still as fresh as in my youth. And quicke inuention springs as currantly As in the greenest head: this little disticke I made this morne, to send vnto my loue, See, here's a legge how full, how little waining, My limbs are still accompanied With their kind fellow heate, no shaking palsie Nor cramp has tane possession, my swift bloud streames Runs quicke and speedie, through their burning channells Pi'sh I am young, he is not antient That hath a siluer badge of hoarie haires But he that in sweete loue is dead and cold So old men oft are young, and young men old I'le take my farewell of this prettie verse It is a prettie verse, I'le reade it againe Conchylio throws downe his spectacles. If I am siluer white and. O ho my spectacles. Ah naughtie boy alas my spectacles Con. Ha ha he your eyes Fredocaldo take vp your eyes hah, ha, he, Fre. Ah naughtie boy alas my spectacles Whether is he gone? O if I finde him Con. Find mee without eyes? hah, ha, he. Fre. O my verses my verses, Snatches his verses. Con. A verie prettie verse: how fresh a braine that made it If I am siluer white and, nay if you'l trie your limbs come on. Exit Fredocaldo. Enter Perindus. Farewell frost: how? Perindus? oh how fitly After warme winter comes a chill could summer This youth in all things is that old mans contrarie This a cold May, that a hot Ianuarie All my art cannot blowe vp one sparkle If I should stay hee'd blast mee, adue sol in Pises Farewell good Caldofredo, I must after Fredocaldo Exit. Scen. 4 Enter Perindus Allcippus. Per. Bles't is that fisher swane that sancke i'th flood Hee's food for them whom he would make his food. But I most wretched, who so many yeares Liue safe in waters to be drownd in feares. In fire and sorrow like Titius is my life A couerd table furnisht still for griefe. Hell loue your paines, for all poore soules can proue Is felt and spoke but thus carelesse I loue. Enter Alcipyus. Alcip. PhÃ¦bus write thou this glorious victory And graue it on thy shining axel-tree That all may see a fisher hath done more Then any age hereafter or before. Per. Alcippus what newes? me thinks I plaine descry Ioy mixt with wonder in thy doubtfull eye. Alcip. Perindus most happy haue I found thee here Per. Is'st good ah tell me, yet my grounded feare Pleads hope impossible. Alcip. Were you away To the Ecco I had told it, as griefe, so ioy Prest downe is burthensome, for now. I see Ioy is no ioy if bard from company Olinda by the Priests enchained-fast Vnto the fatall rocke downe to the wast Was naked left, which thus was better dreast Beauty when most vncloth'd is clothed best: And now the Priest all rites had finished And those last words and hidden verses sayd Then thus he loud proclaimes, who dare aduenture Against this monstrous beast, now let him enter And if he conquer by his bold endeauour This goodly maid shall bee his prize foreuer Straight was the monster loos'd, whose vgly sight Strooke euery trembling heart with cold affright Some sweate, some freeze, some shreike, some silent weare The eye durst neyther winke nor see for feare: Heauen hid his light, the fearefull sunne did shrow'd His glorious eye vnder a ietty cloud. Per. Saw'st thou the Orke? Alcip. Yes, and my panting heart To thinke I saw it in my brest doth start. Per. Can'st thou describe it? Alcip. Neuer tongue can tell What to it selfe no thought can pourtray well. More bigge then monstrous Python, whom men faine By PhÃ¦bus first was bred, by PhÃ¦bus slaine. His teeth thicke rankt in many a double band Like to an armed battell ready stand His eyes sunke in's head, more fearefull stood Like bloodie flame or like to flaming blood Not any eare vpon his head appeares, No plaint nor prayer, no threat nor charme he feares, In sea and land he liues and takes from both Each monsters part which most we feare and loath, Soone as he felt him loose, he shakes his crest And hungry posteth to his ready feast And as through seas his oares a passage teare The thronging waues fly fast, and roare for feare. Per. Me thinks I see him and th' vnhappy louer Strook through with fright. Alcip. In all their shreiks he smiles Stretching his armes, to fight himselfe composes And nothing fear'd his body enterposes Shaking a dart the monster he defies Who scorning such a foe to's banquet flyes But he with certaine aime his Iauelin driues Which as the sender bad at's eye arriues. And fixt in's hollow sight, deepe drenched stood Quenching the bloody fire with fiery blood The wounded monster lowdly gins to yell If Hell doe speake such is the voyce of Hell, And to reuenge his hurt he flies apace The other dart met him i'th middle race And as along he blindly fast doth post His way and t'ther eye together lost Thus blinde he quickly dies, and being dead Leaues to his foe his spoiles, his pawes his head. Per. Hercules thy twelue works with this one conferd This one before thy twelue might be preferd. Alcip. Perindus then mightst thou haue seene how loue Is not more bold then fearefull, he that stroue And conquered such a monster with a dart To her faire eyes yeelds vp his heart Ah hadst thou seene how fearefull modestie Ioynd with chast loue did chide the hungry eye Which hauing long abstaind and long time fasted Some of those dainties now would faine haue tasted Ah hast thou seene which such fit time he got How loue to much remembring loue forgot How th' eye which such a monster did outface Durst not looke vp vpon her eie to gaze How th' hand which such a bould fight vndertooke When her it toucht as with a palsie shooke. As all that saw it thou wouldst soone haue sayd That neuer liu'd so fortunate a maid. Most happy such a danger to recouer More happy farre by hauing such a louer. And harke the Fishers home the victor bringing Chant lowd his conquest, his due praises singing. Scen. 5. Enter in triumph with Chorus of Fishers and Priests singing Atyches crownd leading Olinda following Glaucilla and Cosma. Song Olinda if thou yeeld not now The Orke lesse monstrous was then thou No monster to the eye more hatefull Then beauty to desert vngratefull Yeeld then thy heart and hand And sing along this sand Loue rule heauen, sea, and land. Per. Atyches how farest thou? O let these armes inlace thee Me thinks I hold halfe heauen when I imbrace thee. Atych. Will Perindus goe with vs to the temple? Per. Most willingly and when thou once art there Then 'tis a temple I may iustly sweare. Exeunt omnes. Scen. 6. Enter Cancrone and Scrocca with their boate from fishing. Scr. Yet more larboord! hol vp against that waue now starboord! Can. I thinke we are vpon the shallow Scr. Hold in Cancrone I smell the shore Cancrone fals in. Can.

Scro. Ah ha this is something fresher then Neptuns salt potion, seest not what a pickle I am in, but O those Scyllaes bandogs (bough wough) our boate bepist her selfe for feare. Can. I and thou thy selfe for companie; faith wee were almost in Thetis powdring tub, but now Scrocca. lets off with our liquor: Sirrah halfe to this blew-beard Neptune, but he gets not one drop on't.

So mee thinks my braine is somewhat warmer now my witt gear's on. Let Neptune rage and roare and fome For now Concrone's safe at home. Scr. How now Cancrone! what? poefied? Can. Why Scrocca is it such a matter for a waterman to be a poet now a daies? Sco. I but I wonder that in all thy Poems thou neuer madst an Epitaph for thy grandsire that was eaten vp by the Cyclops. Can, Ah Scrocca I prethee doe not ming my grand-sire, thou'lt spoile my poetry presently; those hungry side slops; they eate him vp crust and crum, and then kild him too and that which grieues me most: hee neuer sent mee word who it was that bit of's head, yet fayth, one draught more and haue at him. Hee drinkes. Scr. Nay if one draught will serue, he shall neuer starue for an Epitaph. Can. So: it's comming I haue it Scrocca. Here lies Cancrones grandsire, who sans boate. Sands winde, sans seas saild downe the Cyclops throate. Scr. Here lies? Why will you graue an Epitaph on the Cyclops belly? I'me sure hee lies yonder. Can. Masse thou sayst true, but all our late writers begin so. Scr. Well sir will you walke home and warme your poeticall vaine at the kitchin fire. Can. Yes I care not if I doe, for I shall nere be well till I haue got the chimney corner ouer my head. Farewell ye rockes and seas, I thinke yee'l shew it That Sicelie affords a water-Poet Scen. 7. Enter Conchylio solus. Hah, ha, he; I haue laught my selfe weary: i'st possible? That fire and frost should thus keepe house together, Sure age did much mistake him, when it set His snowie badge on his blew riueld chin. Were not his faces furrowes fild with snow His hams vnstrung his head so straightly bound His eyes so rainy, and his skinne so drie He were a pretty youth. Scen. 8. Enter Cancrone and Scrocca. Con. What old acqaintance? lie by Mistris a little I'le fish a while, I may chaunce to catch A Cods-head; Ile stand and heare them. Sor. Did not I tell you we were wrong? sir. Can. Me thought, we were at land vile soone. Scr. I prethee on which hand was the cape of Peloro, When wee left Syllaes bandogs. Can. That did belong to thy water office to marke, But sure it stood straight before a little o'th' on side, Right vpon the left, and then it left, the right, And turned west by East, and then stood still North, North, By South. Con. Well bould woodcocke Without a bias. Scr. Come looke about you to your land office. I'le hold a ped of oysters the rocke stands on yonder side; Looke this way: I prethee is not this Circe's rocke, Can. I like thy reasons wondrous well it is her rocke and her distaffe too. Con. I'le spine some thred out of this distaffe. Scr. Then I sweare by Circes iugling box wee come in o' th' wrong side. Can. Looke into my poll, canst thou not perceiue by the colour of my braines that I haue vnlac't her knauery? thou knowst Circes is a plaguie witch. Scr.

These fishers are new returnd from fishing, and know not that Atyches has slaine the Orke, I'le Orke them. Can. Ah Sirocca I would this Orke were in Neptunes bellie, that will suffer such a worme to liue in his dominions, I am a very macherell if the very name be not worse to mee then, three nights cold fishing. Scr. Mee thinks I am colder too then I was before. Con. Let mee strike then before the iron be key cold What hardie fishers dare approch this shore Vntrod by men this twenty years and more. Can. Good now Conchylio doe not the Norke Scr. Wee did eate the golden apples; wee. Can. What old Cancrone?

Glaucilla why should I lie I tooke them as spoiles from a slaine enemio, And for these gifts (sayes he) his last demand Was this, that I might kisse thy hand: The last, the only gift thou canst impart To such, so louing, and now dying heart! I grant; be gone, vpon the Ring I spie A Rubie cut most artificially, Wherein was fram'd a youth in fire consuming, And round within it as the Ring I turne, I found these words, Aliue or dead, I burne. Glau. These words well fitt his heart, so you, so I Thalander liuing loues, and louing dies. Olin. But oh those fained flames, such strange desires, Such true, such lasting, neuer-quenched fires Haue kindled in my brest, that all the Art Of Triphons selfe cannot allay my smart: Ah Glaucilla, the scornefull proud Olinda; Which at so sweete a loue a mockery made, Who scornd the true Thalander, loues his shade, Whose thousand graces liuing could not turne mee, His ashes now hee's dead to ashes, burne mee. Glau. If thus you loue him, how canst thou allow Thy loue to Atyches! late didst thou vowe In Neptunes temple to be his for euer. Olin. My hand he married there, my heart ah neuer. Glaucilla, I loue him for his loue to mee, For such his venture, for such his victorie, But most, because in loue he is my riuall, Because hee's like and loue, my Loue Thalander. Ah, if my life will please him, let him take it, He gaue it mee and I would faine forsake it. Had it beene mine to giue, my wretched heart, Not worth his dangerous fight, I would impart But that is thine, Thalander thine for euer With mee tis buried and arise shall neuer. And wherefore serues this glasse? Olin. This is a dessamour Cosma lately gaue mee. Glau. Olinda, knowst not yet the treachery Of Cosma, she thy greatest enemy? Prethee let me see't: shouldst thou this liquor proue, I tell thee, friend, 'twill quench thy life and loue. But so Ile temper't, it shall better please thee, And after few spent houres shall euer ease thee. Olin, Tis beyond art, who there can giue reliefe. Where patients hate the cure, more then the griefe? Glau. Yes, by my art, before th'art 12 houres older, Ile ease thy heart, though neuer make it colder. Exeunt. Scen. 3. Enter Conchilio. Con. Glaucilla and Olinda? I marle what mettle, What leaden earth and water nature put Into these Nymphes, as cold, as dull, as frozen As the hard rockes they dwell on! But my Mistris Shee's all quicksiluer, neuer still, still mouing, Now is she with some shepheard or some fisher, And here she sets me to entertaine all commers: This is the houre her Louers vse to muster. But who should this be? ist you, old boy? Enter Fredocaldo. Old ten i'th hundred, are you the captaine? boh, Fred. Beshrew your heart, you are a very naughty boy, I shake euery ioynt of me. Con. No shaking palsey, nor crampe has tane possession Of your nimble limbes: ha, ha, he. Fred. Boy, where's thy Mistris? Con. Where she would bee. Fred. Where's that? Con. Where you would bee, Fred. What, in her bed? Con. Ah old goate, doe I smell you? yet in her bed? Fred. May not I speake a word or two with her. Con. what a foole tis? thou hast spoken twice a allreadie Fred. I But I would speake them in her eare. Can. I know your errand but I preethee tell mee Fredocaldoe How ist possible that all the bellowes in loues fathers shoppe Should kindle any fire in such a frost? Fred. Thou knowst not what is loue, I tell thee boy I loue faire Cosma more then all her louers. Con. Now in my conscience he says true, this old wood Makes a brighter fire then the greenest euer: Fred. Conchylio th'art deceiud, hast not seene That of the May the lust of all the yeare Nipt with the hoarie frost grows cold and chare? And oft October though the yeares declining With many daintie flowers is fairely shining For as the flaming sunne puts out the fire So may the heate of loue quench loues desires. Con. Cou'd this dotard doe as well as speake, he mightâ Fred. I tell thee boy, when I was youngâ Con. That was at the siedge of Troy Now shall wee haue, more tales then euer poets made But what will you giue mee Fredocaldoe If I helpe thee in the rockie caue, neere to the mirtle groue To speake with Cosma all alone. Fred. If thou'l doe it, Ile giue thee as faire an otter tamd for fishing as euer was in Sicely. Con. Your hand on that: Ah old Saturne cold and dry we'l Ile doe't Fred. But when Conchylio when? Con. Within this houre expect her. Fred. Wilt thou besure. Con. Why did I euer deceiue you? Fred: neuer neuer: Con. beeleue mee Fredocaldoe I say beleeue mee then. Fred. Farewell; I'le keepe my promise. Con. Faile not within this houre: Exit Fredocaldoe. I know not what this old man's like, vnlesse Our hill of Sicely the flaming Ãtna: Whose parches bowells still in fire consuming Fils all the valley with flame and pitchy fuming. Yet on his top congealed snow doth lye As if there were not fire nor PhÅbus nie. Why should we count this strange? when euen so This old mans heart's all fire, his head all snow? But what fresh souldier's this? Enter Armillus. Ar. My pretty wagge? Con. Sure you doe mistake me, sir, I am anothers. Ar. Thou dost mistake mee, boy, I know well whose thou art. Con. I doubt you doe not. Ar. Th'art faire Cosmaes boy. Con. My mother told me so. Ar. Th'art a very wagge, take this, my boy. Con. True sir, now I am yours indeede; what! yellow? yours to command: what would you with me? Ar. Seest thou! Con. Yes I see very well. Ar. Thou art too: quicke I prethee let me see thy Mistris. Con. Troth, sir, you cannot, shee's taken vp with other busines, or rather taken downe, yet i'le trie sir. Exit, Ar. Oft haue I maruaild how the erring eye, Which of his proper obiect cannot lye, In other subiect, failes so in his duty When hee's to iudge of's chiefest obiect beauty. None takes the night for day, the day for night. The Lillies seeme alike to euery sight: Yet when we partiall iudge of beauties graces, Which are but colours plac't in womens faces, The eye seemes neuer sure the selfesame show And face, this thinkes a swanne, and that a crow. But sure our minds with strong affections tainted, Looke through our eyes as through a glasse that's painted. So when we view our loues, we neuer see What th'are, but what we faine would haue them be. Thus Atyches. Perindus thus affecting These Nymphs, make them seem worthiest their respecting, And thus to louo their beauties neuer moue them: But therefore beautious seeme because they loue them. Me thinks this Cosma farre them both excels, In whose high forehead loue commanding dwels. I like not this same too much modestie, Commend the Senate for their grauity. The wanton Nymph doth more delight me farre, The modest Nymphs doe more seeme chaste then are, Women are all alike, the difference this, That seemes and is not, that both seemes and is. Or if some are not, as they call it, ill, They want the power and meanes, but not the will. Enter Conchylo. Con. My Mistris as yet is so ouerlayd with sport or busines, she cannot speake with you: may not I know your errand? Ar. My errand boy is loue. Con. Loue (um) tis light enough, I shall carry it away: 'tis so short I shall remember it; but troth sir, another golden star this starlesse night dropt in my hand, may chance to giue light to make my Mistris shine in your armes. Ar. Hold thee boy, hold thee: will that content thee? Con. Sir doe you know thy myrtle groue? Ar. Yes well. Con. Your star will conduct you thither straight, within this houre shee'l meete you there. Ar. How canst thou assure it? Con. Trust mee I'le procure it; Else neuer more let me see golden stars. Ar. I'le try thee boy, 'tis but one mis-spent houre, If thou performe thy promise good Conchylio, Many such glittering nights shall shine on thee. Con. If? make no question sir. Ar. Farewell. Con. Adiew. Exit. This strange new bird, this goose with golden eggs Must with some graine of hope bee cherished, And yet not fedde too fat; now for my Crab, Here's his twin, if heauens signes are right. Enter Scrocca. Next to the crab, the twin must come insight, I'le out and seeke him. Scen. 4. Scrocca, Cancrone. Scr. Saile home by land quotha? well, I'le haue that saddle boate hung vp for a monument in the temple of Odoxcom, hard by the euerlasting shooes, and now to see the ill lucke on't neuer more neede of fish, a bounsing feast toward, vmber of guests, not a whiting, not a haddock, not a cod-mop in the house: and in stead of catching fish, wee must goe fish for our nets, Cancrone, come along, along, along: the Orke's dead and buried, the Orke's dead and buried. Can. I but does not his ghost walke thereabout? within. Neptune On afore, I'le follow hintly fintly, by the hobnailes of horse-shooesâ Scr. Nay if you sweare, we shall catch no fish, what Cancrone, sneake you still? whoop, we shall fish fairely if your fearmore be off: Enter Cancrone butning his coate. How now, what all in white? Can. Seest not I am busified? doest thou thinke a man can button his coate and talke all at once? Scr. My prettie sea-cob, why I prethee why in thy white? Con. I no triumph I Ino triumph! tell thee this is my triumphing sute, did not wee vanquish the Orke? Scr. I hope so: too but all our fellow fishers say t'was Atyches. Can. Thus Atyches kild him aliue, and wee kild him dead. Scr. I prethee on with thy gaberdine againe. Can. My old scaly slimie gaberdine? why, if I should fish in that, euery finne would smell mee. Scr. Well, our nets are not aboue ground, what shall wee doe? Con. Why then Sir, you must goe seeke them vnder ground. Scr. Well Sir, you'l follow. Exit. Can. Muddie Scrocca, canst thou not perceiue Cancrones inside by his new out-side? my old Orke apparell, my pitch patch poledauies had no good perfume for a sweete louer, as I now must be: but why a louer? because I meane to kill the next Orke hand to hand; for my masters sisters sweetheart Ataches, because a louer, therefore an Orkekiller. Enter Conchylio. Con. What? old crab tortoise? has the Orke made you cast your shell? Can. Fish mee no fishing: I'me all for flesh. Con. Thy lob hath learnt that fishers keepe no lent. Can. Therfore thou blue-beard Neptune, and thou trumphing Triton, and thou watchet iacket Glaucus, Daucus, Maucus, and all the rest of the salt fish gods, I denounce you all, and for your formable farewell, I doe here reach forth to your dropping driueling deities my loue warme hand to kisse. So, haue you done? Fie flapmouth. [Conchylio spits ins hand. Triton, thou beslauerest mee. Con. O doutie loues! heres more game for my mistresses net, or rather for mine. Can. Nothing but Uenus smocke or Cupids wing shall wipe it dry; surmount thy wagging wanton wing to mee, god Cupid. Con. Are you there? I Orkt you once, and now Ile fit you for a Cupid. Exit. Conchyl. Can. Mee thinks I am growne very eloquent alreadie; thanks sweete loue; O now for my master Perindus, he has a fine crosse cut with's armes, and yet that Orke-catcher Ataches has a pesslence carriage on's pate: the Nymphs beleare him partly: so, so, so. Now Cupid doe I come to thee, To thee, vpon my bare-head knee: Knee neuer bare-head yet before, Before it begged at thy doore. Enter Scrocca. with his nets. Scr. What? deuout Cancrone knocking at Cupids doore? Can. Ah Scrocca, thou hast corrupted the goodest verse! I was making my supplantation to Trustie Triton for good lucke, and see if he haue not heard mee: our nets are returnd. Scr. He might well heare thee for this once: for thou doest not trouble him often. But if I had not lookt to them better then he had, wee might haue gone whistle for them: come Cancrone, will you goe? Can. Yes I warrant you, I'le peraduenture my person in a Cocke-boate. Scr. Why then wee'l take the gallie foist. Can. Goe foist if you will, the burnt child dreads the water, and good men are scantie, make much of one, Cancrone. Scr. Well, if you come, you shall haue vs at the red roche. Can. Yes, I'le fish on land for mermaids. Exit. This dog-fish had almost put mee out of my loue-lesson. Now to thee againe, courteous Cupid. All sunke and soust in soppy loue, Cupid for thy mothers doue Helpe. Enter Conchylio in Cupids habitt. Con. All haile, Cancrone, according to thy wish I here am present great King of hearts, Duke of desires, Lord of loue, whom mortals gentle Cupid doe ycleape. Can. Beest thou Cupid? thou art vile like our Conchylio. Con. True, Cancrone, and lest the beames of my bright deitie should with their lustre wound those infant eyes, I haue vouchsaf't in this for me to appeare, lo, thy Conchylio and thy Cupid here, what wouldst thou with mee? Can. I haue a suite to your godship. Con. So it be not your Orke-suite I embrace it: say on, my darling. Can. I am in loue as they say, but I cannot tell whom to be in loue withall. Con. Here are Nymphs enow, Vrina, Olinda, Lilla, Glaucilla, Bobadilla, Can. Mee thinks that Boberdil sounds like a fine play-fellow for mee. Con. No, I'le tell thee one, her name shall make thy mouth water. Can. Make water in my mouth? thats Vrina, I'le none of her, shee's too high colourd. Con. No, tis Cosma, the fishers flame, the shepheards hope, whose beautie Pas admires. Can. I, but will you throw forth a good word for mee? Con. I tell thee I'le make her all to beloue thee, shee shall not rest till thee meete thee here; but first I must arme thee with some magicke charmes. Can. What be they? my chops would faine be champing them. Con. First you must anagramatize her name, then sympathize your owne. Can. Tize, zize, thize. I shall ne're hit that. Con. For an anagram I'le fit you: Cosma a smocke. Can. Prettie. Con. For the sympathie of your owne name but thus, your name Cancrone bids you counterfeite the counter-creeping crab; and goe backward to her. Can. Doe I looke like a crab? I had rather goe forward to a Nymph. Con. Thirdly, because euery fisher is borne vnder Pisces, therefore the signe is in the foote with you: you must come therefore with one foote bare. Con. I but shall I not catch cold and cough and spoile my part? Can. It must be the right foote: and then seest thou this mirtle tree? all my arrowes are made of the wood of it, thou must in her sight get vp and gather the highest bough of it. Con. I but what shall I doe with the bough? Con. O the bough? why, setting thus a prettie while, you must wrappe a cockle garland about it, and then when the poore lasse melts and consumes with thy loueâ Can. Then I'le throw it at her, &amp; come downe to her, shall I not? Con. Excellent well, I see thou art inspir'd. Can. Nay I can take it, if you put it to mee. Con. But the iust nicke when thou must throw it is, when she says I die, I cry, I lie. Can. I die, I cry, I lye. I would haue her lie, but not die, but will you make her come indeede? Con. I and in her best clothes too. Can. Nay 'tis no such matter for clothes, but what must I say? I had almost forgot it. Con. Nothing but a short charme, which I'le teach you as we goe on afore, I'le follow you. Can. Let me see: backward? Con. Blockhead. Can. Barelegge? Con. Beetlepate. Can. Cockleshell? Con. Coxecombe. Can. Boughs? Con. Bussard. Can. The towne's ours. I no triumph, I no triumph. Con. I'le coole my hot louer, he shall sit on a perch for a stale, now must I be vncupidate, &amp; shortly appeare here Cosmafied, it shall be hard but with the same limetwig I'le catch a bigger bird then this. First I will serue my selfe, my mistris after; My baite is seeming loue, my prey true laughter. Scen. 5. Enter Pas solus. What art, strength, wit, can tame a fish or flye? The least of creatures vs'd to liberty, With losse of life shake off base captiue chaines, And with restraint all life disdaines. But I, ah foole, yeld vp my selfe a slaue, And what they shunne, by death doe basely craue: My griefe more then my folly, who deplore That which all others vse to wish before: My loue loues too too much too many, For while she liketh all, she loues not any. Loue, let my prayers yet thus farre onely moue thee, Let me her falsly, or she truely loue me. Enter Cosma. See where she comes; and that so bright a sunne Should haue no spheare, no certaine race to runne: I'le stand and ouer-heare her. Cos. I can but smile to thinke how foolish wise Those women are, that chuse their loues for wisedome. Wisedome in men's a golden chaine to tie Poore women in a glorious slauery. Pas. Hark Heauens! O monstrous! harke. O women, women. Cos. Fond men, that blame the loue that euer ranges To foule and sluttish loue, that neuer changes. The Muses loue by course, to change their meeter, Loue is like linnen often chang'd, the sweeter. Pas. Thus these neate creatures, dead with loue and all, By shunning beastlines, make it beastiall. Cos. Our beauty is our good, the cause of loue: Fond that their good toth' best will not improue; What Husbandman neglects his time of sowing? What fisher loseth winds, now fairely blowing? Beauty our good: ah good, ah short and brittle, A little little good, for time as little, How easie doest thou slide, and passe away? Vnborne, full growne, and buried in a day. Thy spring is short, and if thou now refuse it, Tis gone, when faine thou wouldst, thou shalt not vse it. The time and euery minute daily spends thee. Spend thou the time, while time fit leisure lends thee. Pas. Does she not blush? hark, women, heres your preacher, Maids, you want a Mistris; heres a teacher. Cos. Now since Conchylio spake of this Armillus, My new found louer, I halfe long to try him: Too cruell she that makes her hearts contenting, To see a heart languish in loues tormenting. What though i'th' night we liue most wantonly? I' th'morne with clothes we put on modestie. Thus though we sport, and wanton all the night Next sunne ile act a part of feare and fright. Pas. Modestie? marry guipp: these are your modest creatures. Cos. Long haue I hated Olinda, and Glaucilla, And one of them by this hath drunke her last, The next shall follow ere the next day's past. The ginne is layd, and if it hit aright, This is her last, this her eternall night. Perindus long I haue long lou'd, who euer scorn'd mee, Because he loues Glaucilla; I know hee'l grieue: But when the tempest once is ouerblowne, Hoyst vp all sailes; the prize is sure mine owne. Ill for a woman is that woman plac't, Who like old Ianus, is not double fac't. Now to Armillus who sure expects me. How darke the night? more fit for Louers play. The darkest night is louers brightest day. Exit Cosma. Pas. Well Mistris Iana with your double face, I thinke I shall outface you by and by. Ile fit you for a face i'fayth, I could be mad now. Well, since you are sportiue, i'le make one i'th play: You haue a foole already, i'le act a Deuill; And since you needes must to a new consort, Ile beare a part, and make or marre the sport. Enter Perindus. Scen. 6. Perindus, Pas. Per. Atyches? Pas. No: Pas. Per. If thou seest Atyches, send him hither friend; Exit Pas. Of all the plagues that torture soules in hell, Tantale, thy punishment doth most excell. For present goods, thy euill most expresse, Making thee vnhappy in thy happinesse. Such are my paines: my blessednes torments mee, I see, and may enioy what more torments me. My life then loue, I rather would forsake, Yet for my life, my loue I dare not take. Glaucilla, couldst thou see this wretched brest, What torments in it neuer resting rest, Whom now thou thinkst the cause of all thy greeuing, Then thou wouldst iudge the wretchedst creature liuing. She's here. Enter Glaucilla. Glau. Perindus, whither goest thou? the day's enough To shew thy scorne, the night was made for rest. For shame if not for loue, let night relieue me: Take not that from mee, which thou wilt not giue me. Knowst thou this place? euen here thou first didst vow, Which I beleeue, and still me thinkes euen now Cannot vnbeleeu't, that when thy constant heart, From his first onely vowed loue should start, These wauing seas should stand, whose rocks remoue, Per. Fa, la, la, fa, la, la, lah. Glau. O dancing leuity, you steady rocks, Still stand you still? his fayth he lightly mocks. Yee fleeting waues, why doe you neuer stand? His words, his loue, his oathes, are writ in sand. In rocks and seas I finde more sense and louing, The rocke lesse hard then he, the sealesse mouing. Per. Didst neuer see the rockes in sayling moue? Glau. Not moue, but seeme to moue. Per. My picture right. Glau. What says Perindus? Per. Ha, ha, he, how scuruily griefe laughs! Glau. Perindus, by all the vowes I here coniure thee, The vow that on thy soule thou didst assure me, Tell me why thus my loue thou false refusest? Why me thy fayth thy selfe thou thus deceiuest? Per. Ay me. Glau. How fares my loue? Per. Ah Glaucilla. Glau. I know thou canst not hate me. Per. I cannot hate, but laugh, and dance and sport, This is not hate, Glaucilla, 'tis not hate. Glau. Canst thou Perindus thus delude me? I'ue liu'd enough, farewell: thou last hast viewd mee. Per. Glaucilla? Glau. How canst thou speake that hated name? Per. Stay: Glau. To be mockt? Per. Stay, i'le tell thee all. Glau. Me thinks this forced mirth does not beseeme thee: Sure 'tis not thine, it comes not from thy heart. Per. Glaucilla, call backe thy wish, seeke not to know Thine or my death, thou winst thine ouerthrow. Glau. Thy griefe is common, I haue my part in thine: Take not that from me which is iustly mine. Per. if I had any ioy, it were thine owne, But grant me to be wretched all alone. Glau. Now all thy griefe is mine, but it vnhiding, Halfe thou wilt take away, by halfe diuiding. Per. Thou seekst my loue, it is my loue to hide it, And I shall shew more hate, when I diuide it. Glau. Thy loue thus hid, to me much hatred proues, Vnhide thy hate, this hate will shew it loues: Per. Glaucilla, while my griefes vntouched rest, My better part seemes quiet in thy brest. Glau. So thou art well, but still my better part, Perindus, sinkes all loaden with his smart: So thou my finger cut'st, and woundst my heart. Per. Since then thou wilt not giue me leaue to hide it, Briefely 'tis thus: when thou thy loue hadst vowd me Most sure, but yet no certaine time allowd me; My marriage day as all my good desiring, To Proteus Cell I went, the time enquiring, There heard these words, the cause of all my sadnes, The cause of all my seeming hate and gladnesse, Thus went th' Oracle. The day, that thou with griefe so long forbearest, Shall bring thee what thou wishest most and fearest. Thy sisters graue shall bee her marriage bed, In one selfe day twice dying, and once dead. Thy friend, whom thou didst euer dearest choose, In loosing thou shalt finde, in finding loose. And briefly to conclude the worst at last, Thou, or thy Loue shall from a rocke be cast. Glaucilla, had thy loue but with my life beene priz'd, My life t'enioy thy loue I had despis'd. But since it may be thine, thy life destroying, Shall nere bee giuen for my loues enioying: Much rather, let me liue in fires tormenting, Then with such purchase buy my hearts contenting. Glau. Then loue's the cause of all thy seeming hate, What hast thou seene in me, that I should seeme, My life more then thy loue, or mine esteeme? Perindus thy hate hath cost me often dying, So hast thou giuen mee death, by death denying: For th' Oracle, with death I am contented, And will not feare, what cannot be preuented. Per. Yet though such mischiefe Proteus did diuine, Much better sped I at my fathers shrine: Comming to Delphos, where the Pythian maid Told me my wishes should be fully paid And that within few dayes I should arriue Through many bitter stormes, into the hiue. Glau. Why doubtst thou then? adiew loue till to morrow, Next rising sunne shall to thee ease thy sorrow. Per. Maist thou proue true, or if heauen bad decree The good be thine, light all the bad on me. Glau. Farewell. Exit. Thou giuest Glaucilla what thou wishest good rest. This victory my minde hath whole possest, And from my eyes shuts out all sleepe and rest: If I but slumber, streight my fancie dreames, This Atyches is much more then he seemes: Comming to his couch, I found his emptie bed As yet vntoucht, himselfe from sleepe is fled. But soft, whom haue wee here? Enter Atyches. Atych. The Oxe now feeles no yoke, all labour sleepes, The soule vnbent, this as her play-time keepes, And sports it selfe in fancies winding streames, Bathing his thoughts in thousand winged dreames. The fisher tyr'd with labour, snorteth fast, And neuer thinks of paines to come or past, Only loue waking rest and sleepe despises, Sets later then the sunne, and sooner rises. With him the day as night, the night as day, All care, no rest, all worke, no holy-day. How different from loue is louers guise! He neuer opes, they neuer shut their eyes. Per. Ha: this is he, I'le stand and ouerheare him. Atych. So: I am alone, ther's none but I, My griefe, my loue, my wonted company, And which best fits a grieued louers sprite, The silent stars and solitarie night. Tell mee heauens sentinels that compasse round This ball of earth, on earth was neuer found A loue like mine, so long, so truly seru'd, Whose wage is hate, haue all my paines deseru'd Contempt? mine and her; for shee deare affected: The more I lou'd, the more I was neglected. Since thou canst loue where thou hast hatred prou'd, Olinda, how canst thou hate where thou art lou'd? Thy body is mine by conquest, but I find, Thy bodie is not alwayes with thy mind. Giue both or none, or if but one, o'th' two Giue mee thy mind, and let thy bodie goe. If this without thy minde I only haue, What giu'st thou more to me then to thy graue? Prooue mee, my deare, what canst thou hate in mee? Vnlesse my loue, my loue still bent on thee? My name's Thalander, perhaps it doth displease thee, I will refuse my name, if that may ease thee. Thalander to exile wee'l still confine, And i'le be Atyches, so I bee thine. Per. Thalander? i'st possible? I oft suspected How he is altered! not himselfe! i'st possible? Aty. Yet what thou hat'st, thy brother loues as well. Tell me, my dearest loue, what haue I done? What has Thalander done? ah tell mee. Per. More Then thousand such as she can nere restore, Thalander; start not; how haue my eyes deceiu'd me? Ah, let me blesse my armes with thy embraces. My deare, Thalander, my only life, my heart, My soule, O of my soule the better part. Ist thee I hold; I scarce dare trust mine eyes, Which thus deceiu'd mee by their former lies. Aty. Thou welcomst miserie while thine armes infold mee. Per. I am the blessedst man that liues to hold thee. My heart doth dance to finde thee. Aty. Ah Perindus, When least thou thinkst, thou art deceiued most, My selfe, my loue, my labour I haue lost, When I haue lost my selfe, to finde my loue. Per. In losing of thy fame, th'ast found She loues thee friend most dearely, And though she thought thy loue would be her death. Yet for and in thy loue, shee'd lose her breath, And nothing else should grieue her in the end She had one life for such a loue to spend. Aty. Doe not deceiue me. Per. Why shouldst thou mistrust me? Aty. Perindus, my ioy, by too much ioy enioying, I feele not halfe my ioy, by ouer-ioying. Per. Her selfe shall speake it. Come, let's goe. Aty. 'Tis night! Per. Shee'l thinke it day, when thou art in her sight. Aty. Lead me, for yet my mind, too much affected To haue it so, makes truth it selfe suspected. Exeunt. CHORVS. Loue is the fire, damme, nurse, and seede Of all that aire, earth, waters breede. All these earth, water, aire, fire, Though contraries, in loue conspire. Fond painters: loue is not a lad, With bow, and shafts, and feathers clad; As he is fancied in the braine Of some loose louing idle swaine, Much sooner is he felt then seene, His substance subtile, slight and thinne, Oft leapes hee from the glancing eyes, Oft in some smooth mount he lyes, Soonest he winnes, the fastest flyes: Oft lurkes he twixt the ruddy lips, Thence while the heart his Nectar sips, Downe to the soule the poyson slips, Oft in a voyce creeps downe the eare, Oft hides his darts in golden haire, Oft blushing cheeks do light his fire, Oft in a smooth soft kinne retires, Often in smiles, often in teares; His flaming heate in water beares, When nothing else kindles desire, Euen vertues selfe shall blow the fire: Loue with thousand darts abounds, Surest and deepest vertue wounds, Oft himselfe becomes a dart, And loue with loue, doth loue impart. Thou painfull pleasure, pleasing paine, Thou gainefull life, thou losing gaine: Thou bitter sweete, easing disease, How doest thou by displeasing please? How doest thou thus bewitch the heart? To loue in hate, to ioy in smart. To thinke it selfe most bound, when free, And freest in his slauery. Euery creature is thy debter, None but loues, some worse, some better: Onely in loue, they happy prooue, Who loue what most deserues their loue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. Scen. 1. Enter Perindus and Thalander. Per. Be patient. Aty. Yes, I am patient, And suffer all, while all heauens ills are spent. Per. You giue your selfe to griefe. Aty. Sencelesse and mad. Who in much griefe, is not extremely sad? Per. Alas sir, she was mortall, and must die. Aty. True, true, and could the fates no time espie But this? to me she neuer liu'd till now, And now Perindus? now! ohâ Per. She was my sister! Aty. Alas, thy sister! She was my life, my soule, she was my loue, She wasâwords know not what she was to me: She wasâthou most accursed word of was. Per. Be comforted. Tha. Perindus, the very name of comfort, is most comfortlesse Comfort, ioy, hope, liu'd in her cheerfull smiling, And now must die, or liue in far exiling. Comfort, ioy, hope, for euer I deny you, And would not name you now but to defie you. Per. Sir, with more patience you haue often borne Far greater euils. Tha. Perindus, doe not say so, If thou yet loue me, prethee doe not say so: Was euer ill as this? hels breuiary, All torment in this narrow space is layd, The worst of all, in these two words are sayd: Olinda dead? dead! whither doest thou lead mee? Why, I can goe alone, alone can finde The way I seeke, I see it best when blinde. I prethee leaue me. Per. Thalander, I'le not leaue thee, Should heauen with thunder strike these arms that claspe thee, My dying hands should but more firmely graspe thee. Tha. Thou violat'st thy loue in thy mistaking, And cleane forsak'st thy friend, in not forsaking Olinda: I cannot come, they heere enchaine me. But neyther can, nor shall they here detaine me. I'th' meane time, all the honour I can giue thee, Is but a graue, that sacred rocke, the place Of my conception, and my buriall: Since Hymen will not, death shall make thee mine, If not my marriage, my death-bed shall be thine. Exeunt. Scen. 2. Enter Rimbombo. Farewell yee mountaines, and thou burning Ãtna, If yet I doe not beare thee in my brest, And am my selfe, a liuing walking Ãtna, The Nymphs that on you dwell, are too coy, Too coy and proud, more fierce then robbed tygre More deafe then seas, and more inflexible Then a growne Orke, false, flattering, cruell, craftie, And which most grieues me, when I would embrace them, Swifter then chased Deere, or dogs that chase them, You heauens, what haue we poore men deserued, That you should frame a woman, I and make her So comely and so needefull? why should you cloath them With so fine a shape? why should you place Gold in their haire, allurement in their face? And that which most may vex vs, you impart Fire into their burning eyes, yce to their heart. Why sweeten you their tongues with sugred charmes And force men loue, and need their greatest harmes? And most of all, why doe you make them fleete? Minds as the windes, and wings vpon their feete? Of hundred women that I know, But one deserues to be a woman: Whom better heauens haue not made more faire, Then courteous, louing, kinde, and debonaire: She, when she vsd our Mountaines, oft would stay, And heare me speake, and vow, and sweare, and pray. Here I haue learnt, she haunts along these shores: Within these rockie clifts i'le hide my selfe, Till fit occasion, if shee haue chang'd her minde, Then safely may I curse all women kinde. Exit. Scen. 3. Enter Armillus. Loue, without thee, all life is tedious, Without thee, there's no sweete, no ioy, no life; Thou first gau'st life, and still with new succession, Continuest what thou gau'st, with sweet inticements, Taming the strongst rebellion, thy weapons women, Whom thou so fram'st, that proudest men are glad, Beaten with them, gently to kisse the rod. Eyther my weighty passions pull too fast The wheele of time, or else the houre is past: But this is she, or I mistake it. Enter Cosma. Cos. Women that to one man their passions bind, As this man alters, so alters still their mind: Thus euer change they, as those changing faires, And with their louers still their loue impaires: But I, when once my louers change their graces, Affect the same, though now in other faces: Thus now my mind is firme, and constant prou'd, Seeing I euer loue, what first I lou'd. Who blames the speedy heauen, for euer ranging? Loue's fiery, winged, light, and therfore changing. Ar. True, fairest Nymph, Loue is a fire still burning, And if not slak't, the heart to ashes turning. Cos. If I could scold, sir you might be chidden, For comming to my thoughts before y'are bidden. Ar. Blame me not (Sweet) thy words do fanne thy fires, And coole the flames which thy faire eye inspires. Cos. The fire so lately applied, so lately fram'd? Me thinks, greene wood should not be yet inflam'd. Ar. Loues flame is not like earths, but heauens fire, Like lightning, with a flash it lights desire. Cos. I loue not lightning: lightning loue that flashes Before't be all on fire, will be all ashes. Ar. Gather the fruite then while 'tis yet vnblasted. Cos. Ist worth the gathering? is it pleasing tasted? Ar. Take say of this. kisses her. Monster? Enter Pas offering to kisse on the other side, disguised like a fury. Cos. Helpe ho. Exeunt Armil. Cos. seuerall waies. Scen. 4. Pas. Fredocaldo. Pas. The Doe was almost strooke, 'twas time I came, For once I'le be a keeper of the game. I see 'tis Owle-light, Mineruaes waggoner, Enter Fred. My old riuall, who this twenty yeeres Saw nothing but what shin'd through glasse windowes; What comes he for? I'le stay a while and watch him. Fred. Most happy age that shall be crownd with loue Of thy loue, Cosma: I am not as I seeme, Farewell old age, I now am young againe And feele not ages, but a louers paine, In loue I dare aduenture with the best, Old beaten souldiers are the worthiest: If all my riualls heard I could dare them, If furies should out-front me, I'de out-stare them. Pas runs vpon him, hee falls and lyes. Exit Pas. Enter Conchylio in his Mistresses apparell. Con. How well my Mistris Cosmaes clothes do fit me? What pitty 'twas, I was not made a woman? I thinke I should haue made a pretty Nymph: ha? I could haue beene a pittifull creature, And yet perhaps, a good vnhappy wench. Cosma by this hath met with her Armillus, And sports her selfe: could I meete Fredocaldo, I should haue sport enough: She stumbles at Fred. What Fredocaldo dead? courage, man. Fred. I had a fearefull dreame and scarce am waken. Con. Come shake off dreames, sleepe is not fit for louers, Wee'l to the rocky caue. Fred. My sunne? my fire? Con. But Fredocaldo, can you thinke that fire Can loue cold water, the sunne can frost desire? Fred. I tell thee fairest Cosma, those faire eyes Bring backe my spring: Wrong not thy selfe, deare loue, so faire a day Cannot but make mid-winter turne to May. Cold rhewms I feele not, no frost's lockt in this chest, Thy loue begets a summer in my brest. Con. Fie Fredocaldo: Not in the open aire. Exeunt. Scen. 5. Armillus. Cosma Ar. What furies haunt this groue? is not this Cosma? Yes: here again she comes most blessed heauens, Enter Cosma I see that yee are more gracious then Hell's spightfull. Cosma? Cos. Armillus. Ar. My loue. Cos. Sure thou hast done some cruell murder, And the vnexpiate ghost thus haunts thee. Ar. I neuer thought it, Cosma: rather some power of these woods, Too enuious of my good hap, and iealous of thy fauor, Thus crosses our desires: but if againe He chance to interpose his horrid face, I'le rather dye, then leaue thy wisht embrace. Enter Pas disguised. All hell and furies haunt vs. Exit Ar. Pas. Well ouertaken, Nimph, start not, you are sure, See I am your familiar. Cos. Beshrew your heart for thus affrighting me. Pas. Doe you not blush to cast your loue vpon a man, Whose loue is as himselfe an alien? to thine owne Thou mak'st thee strange, familiar to vnknowne. Cos. Pish, thou art foolish, did I euer binde thee to me Only? why shouldst thou then confine me To thy sole passion? so oft before You men haue chang'd, that you can change no more: From bad to worse, from worse, to worst of all: There lie you now, and can no lower fall: And as you wisht that we should neuer roue, We pray as fast, that you at length could moue. Cease then for shame to raile at womens ranging: When men begin, women will leaue their changing. Farewell. Pas. Nay soft, I am dog well bitten, And will not part so easily with my prey, I haue not tasted venison many a day. Cos. I cannot well deny thee, 'tis thy right: Thou well hast purchast it, this be thy right. Exeunt. Scen. 6. Conchilio. Con. Ha, ha, he: this old dry stubble, how it crackes i'th' burning! alas poore saplesse oake: 'tis time 'twere down, I stayd till he was ready, all vnready, but when he 'gan to put on his spectacles, away slipt I: hee'l doe my mistris little hurt. Spectacles! hah, ha, he! now for my louing Lobster, this is his time; and if the Cyclops too doe keepe his promise, O what rare compound of mirth I'le make, while the one with sha'me, the other with feare I'le take! The fish comes alreadie to the net. Enter Cancrone, going backeward vpon her. He lookes ouer his shoulders. Can. To all I speake, but I tell no man, Whether I loue Nymph or woman. Con. Tell not mee, but tell the rocks, Not words must disciple you but knocks. I am out of your debt for a rime. Can. I thinke shee knew my cue, The charme begins to worke already. Con. I know not how this fishers hooke hath caught mee, I euer for his rudenesse loue him: 'tis the badge of innocencie. Can. Somewhat rude if you will, but innocent in your face. Con. O those glearing eyes that dart the beames, The beames that drownd my heart with fierie streames. Can. Now to Cupids arrowe tree, and she sinks downe-right condoling; Cosma, I haue pitty on thee, but it beseemes a man of my confession, to haue a negligent care of his good reparation abroad in the world and else-where; I would be loth to be seene in my loue-worke, i'le mount the tree and scry the coast. He goes vp the tree. Con. Stay not, but come againe thy selfe, sweete heart, to receiue me. Can. O ho, here's bundance of people, bundance a lookers on, I dare not loue thee before them all, wee'l into the myrtle groue present. Con. Quickly returne, my loue, returne Cancrone my dearest. Can. Stand forth Cosma, and say on till thou come to that, I cry, I dye, I lye. Con. I spie him now approaching, Enter Rimbombo. What though he be all ragges in his limbs? what though his gesture taste of violence? we Nymphes, they say, like not such wooers worst. Rim. Thou speakest of thy Rimbombo, that myrtle groues which loue the winding shores, deserue to bee to Uenus consecrate, as faster friends to louers, then the woods and caues of all the Mounts of Sicily, whose Nymphs do coyly shunne and mocke our troopes, Con. you come somewhat before your time, Rimbombo, And Yet in loue preuention is no crime: Louers may come before, not out of time. And truly I wish, y'had come a little sooner. Euen now a mongrell crabbed fisher swaine Laid siege to this vnconquered fort. Rim. What wight of brauest blood by sea and land dares share with mee in Cosmaes loue? by Polypheme my sea-bred fire I vow, the sand on which he treads, is not so small, as shall this pestell make his pounded bones. Con, Nay now he treadeth not vpon these sands, but is fled, vp to the hills, and shortly thence will of himselfe come tumbling downe to mee. Rim. I would he durst: I neuer yet but once did tast of fishers blood, tis iollie sweete: come fisher, this way or that way I am for you at both weapons, club or teeth: let's to the groue, see, euery mirtle tree bids warre to fishers peace, and ioy to mee. Why weepes my Cosma? Sweete, feare not that which thou desirest. Con. Sweete Cyclops, meanst thou to rauish mee? Rim. O heauens thine owne appointed time and place, thine, owne sweete Cyclops, and can rauishment?â Con. Why this know; wee Nymphs that long liue chast, and weare our girdle of virginityâbut lo, Diana stops my tongue, shee bends her deadly bow, I dare not. Rim. Speake on, here's none but trees, and thy trustie true Rimbombo. Con. By that bright flame which like one only sunne giues day to'th spheare of thy maiesticke face, I thee adiure, that thou disclose to none this sacred mysterie. Rim. Not: to my mother: no not in my dreame: say on Con. Wee neither yeeld, nor take in loue delight, Vntill our girdle first be once vnplight By louers hands, and then about his wast, By our owne hands the same be tied fast. Now all is out. Rim. A pretty piece of work, my hands do their office nimbly, I haue vnfettered thee, come put this sweete yoke on mee. Con. Nay turne about, it must be tied contrarie to other girdles, iust behind, Stand neerer to mee, yet neere. Rim. As close as thou wilt, Cosma; I would your filthy fisher saw vs now, 't would make his teeth water. Con. Hang him stinking Lobster, he daires not look vpon any of thy kinne: his haddocke eyes would start out of his head, if he should see but one haire of Rimbomboes head. Rim. How long wilt thou be tying mee? Con. The more knots I tie, the faster will my loue be to you: but you'l be prating of this secret, when you come home among your mounting Nymphs. Rim. If I doe, then geld mee: hast thou done? Con. I haue but three knots to tie: they are all true knots. Rim. When thou hast done, preethee come kisse me, Cosma, Conchylio steales away, leauing him bound to the tree where Cancrone is. I see thou art a pure virgin, thou neuer didst this office before, thou art no quicker at it. What Cosma? what? no Cosma! what a woodden wench? here's a true loue knot with a witnes. O faithlesse Cosma! O witlesse Rimbombo! O Nymph! O fishers! O shepheards! O Satyrs! O Cyclops! Enter Conchylio againe. Con. Ha, ha ha: O loue! O wit! O tree! O girdle! O platter face! O oyster eyes! Rim. Thou bitch, thou witch, thou spawne of a mermaid. Con. Thou Ãtna, thou Chaos, thou Hell: nay tugge and tugge, my virginitie is tough and strong enough: O for some Nymphs fishers or shepheards to baite this Orke. I'le out and call in some bandog: so ho, so ho, ho, ho. Exit. Rim. The knots are so many, the girdle so strong, and the tree stands so fast. O anger! O shame! here shee'll bring in all the country to laugh mee to death, hide yet thy face with some of these lower boughs. Enter Conchylio. Con. So ho, so ho: O dogged fortune! not one Nymph to be found not one feate fisher! not one: but that feating fisher that is readie to wing his sea token net on the Cyclops blockhead. Rim. Away thou monstrous woman, oh, oh. Con. Away thou monstrous mans ah ha hey. Rim. How now! what's that? what, haue I another witnes of my folly? what gobbet of mans flesh grows, vpon this tree? Con. Ile haue a graft of this mirtle tree, it beares fine loue wormes, on the stocke, a maggot wou'd vp in a Cobweb, on the bough a barnacle, which ere long will fall and turne to a goose: now Cupids gosling, now on your bare-head knee, goe begge at Cupids doore. Can. Ah cursed Cupid, i'le no more of thy seruice, I had rather fight with nine Orkes, ha, hei, au. Rim. Come downe thou fished bit, my mouth shall catch thee Gentle Cosma, i'le forgiue thee all, &amp; loue thee yet, if thou wilt helpe to reach my walking sticke; i'le make my young Orke-ketcher beleeue he shall bee his grandsires heire. Con. Your staffe? marry and shalt, it's a pretty pole to bang those boughes withall, and when thou doest it, doe but gape, and that rotten plumme will fall into thy mouth. Can. Nay, I know of old I should be deuoured. Con. Thy staffe, Rimbombo, is not for a weak Nymph to lift. Rim. Yet a little more to this hand: Oh oh, my shoulder's While Rimbombo reaches for his staffe, Cancrone leapes on's backe, and lies on the ground. thunder strook! O coward Ioue, to strike me on the backe, but wast our fisher lubber? is he escap't our hands? Con. VVhy Cancrone, rise, i'le helpe thee. Can. Good Charon carry me ouer gently, my bones are sore, and your boate side so hard. Con. Giue me thy hand, i'le waft thee. Can. I tell thee Charon, I haue nothing to giue thee for ferriage, i'le helpe to row, I haue beene a poore fisher while I liu'd. Rim. I would I were there too, but that I should sinke Charons boate with a tree at my backe. Con. VVhy valorous Cancrone, view thy selfe and mee thy captiue Cosma, we are conquerours, behold our enemies in fetters fast bound. Can. Am I aliue indeede? me thought this legge hung out of Charons boate i'th' water, did I tie the Orke there; Cancrone rises vp. Come captain, let's goe triumphing to the temple. Con. Nay, the Ork's dead and buried, this is the second fatall for the Cyclops. Can. Is he safe? i'le make side-slops on him. I lay studying how to deale with him vpon equall tearmes: come if thou darest, thou sea-bred brat of Polyphemes fire, you that would licke your lips at sweete fishers blood! sweete fishers blood! marke that Cosma: I hope you thinke so too. Rim. Sweete fisher, I will turne thy net maker if thou wilt vndoe me. Can. No, it shall nere be said that I was the vndoing of any man by net-making, and besides, I haue forsworne the muddie trade. Con. Cancrone, wher's thy spirit? this is that pocketted vp thy grandsire in his wide intrailes. Can. Me thought, when I was on the tree, his breath smelt of fish, my stomacke euen foam'd at him. Now then, sir Bompelo, as that Orke mouth of thine did crumme thy porridge with my grandsires braines, and then gaue him his deaths wound too, so will I first mince out thy scald-pate bones, and giue thy flesh to a fishers boy for haddocks meate, &amp; then, O then I will geld thee, that thou neuer shalt run rutting after the Nymphs. How lik'st thou this? Rim. Shame and scorne make me silent. Con. Nay, I will tell thee fitter vengeance, vse him, as sage Vlysses did his father Polypheme. Can. That same Foolishes had a pole-cat head, I meane to mitigate him: he was something, as it ware about branding a huge stone in a caue, in a goate skinne with Polypheme, when the fire-brand was asleepe. Con. I, I, in the caue he branded out Polyphemes eye, when he was asleepe, and you must imitate him: here take his owne staffe, and make it an extinguisher for that glazing lampe. Rim. This sport I like worst of all: helpe, gods of the woods. Can. I'le blow the coale while you take your aime, but will your farginity hold him fast? Con. I warrant you it has been tried, come be thou my rest, i'le tilt on thy shoulders. Can. Raunt tara, raunt taunt: &amp; Cancrone fals, and his dagger from him in the Cyclops reach. I shall make you stumble, let me Come hinder most. Con. O your Whineyeard, the enemy hath seazd on't. Can. 'Tis no matter, hee'l hardly make it fly out of the Eele-skinne, it hath seene no sunne this fiue quarters of a yeere I am sure. Con. I hope the salt breath of the sea hath seald it vp. Can. O Cosma, 'tis out, let vs out too. Con. O Cancrone, loe thy Cosma, Cupid, and Conchilio. Cyclops, blame not this my supposed sexe, no Nymph, but lad hath caught thee in this snare. Exit. Rim. The greater shame, and fouler scorne to me. Vp to the hill, Rimbombo flye this shore, And neuer deale with fisher-Nymph-lad more. Exit. CHORVS, This his wiues quicke fate lamenting, Orpehus sate his soule tormenting: While the speedy wood came running, And riuers stood to heare his cunning: The hares ran with the dogs along, Not from the dogs, but to his song: But when all his verses turning, Onely fram'd his poore hearts burning: Of the higher powers complaining, Downe he went to hell disdaining: There his siluer Lute-strings hitting, And his potent verses fitting: All the sweets that ere he tooke From his sacred mothers brooke: What his double sorrow giues him, And loue that doubly double grieues him: There he spends to mooue deafe hell, Charming Deuils with his spell: And with sweetest asking leaue Does the Lord of ghosts deceaue. Caron amaz'd his boate foreslowes, While the boate, the sculler rowes, And of it selfe to'th' shoare doth floate, Tripping on the dancing moate. The threeheaded Porter preast to heare, Prickt vp his thrice double eare, The Furies, plagues for Guilt vp-heaping, Now as guilty, fell a weeping: Ixion, though his wheele stood still, Still was wrapt with Musickes skill. Tantale might haue eaten now, The fruite as still as was the bough, But he foole no longer fearing, Staru'd his tast to feede his hearing. Thus since loue hath wonne the field, Heauen and Hell, to Earth must yeeld, Blest soule that dyest in loues sweete sound, That lost in loue in loue art found. If but a true-loues ioy thou once doe proue, Thou wilt not loue to liue, vnlesse thou liue to loue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. Scen. 1. Enter Alcippus and Thalander with a torch. Tha. Tell me, Alcippus, is it day or night? Al. The light you beare, shews you there is no light. Tha. This is none: light was light in her eyes, In them it liu'd, put out with them it dies. The sunne is quench't. Al. Yet soone will shine againe. Tha. Not possible! heauens light will euer plaine. When her two liuing stars can sinke and die, How can the sunne dreame immortality? Al. Sir, if your to mee, or mine to you, might giue me priuiledge, I faine would tell you, that this too fixed loue seemes rather doting. Tha. Alcippus, didst thou euer loue? Al. I thinke sir neuer, Tha. I thinke so too, nor canst know what loue is. Al. Yet this I know, loue still is of the fairest, Fond then the loue, that loues the withered, But madnesse seemes to dote vpon the dead. Tha. True, true, Alcippus, loue is of the fairest, And therefore neuer tyed vnto the body: Which if compared vnto the mindes faire graces, Seemes like the blocke that Lunaes face defaces. But grounded on the mind, whose vertuous parts, And liuing beauties are loues surest darts, Which makes me now as freely loue as euer: Her vertue and my loue decayeth neuer. Seest thou this rocke, Alcippus? tis a temple, Olindaes temple! 'tis a sacred shrine, Where vertue, beauty, and what ere diuine, Are to be worshipt, prethee friend now leaue me, Here is an Altar, I must sacrifice. Al. If you will leaue your griefe. Tha. I will, I will: Indeede I will; leaue me: griefs ebbe growes lowe, When priuate hearts th' eye-bankes ouerflow. Al. I will retire, not leaue him: well, I feare, When two such flood-streams meet, loue and despaire. Tha. Thou blessed Altar, take these worthlesse offrings, The corral's once more drown'd in brine of sorrow, These pearly shells, which dayly shall bee fild VVith my hearts water, through my eyes distild. You corralls, whose fresh beauties are a shadow Of her sweete blushes, tell her liuing graces, Though now as you pluckt from their natiue places, Are yet as you from your first seate remou'd, Here fresher shining then when first I lou'd. Thou rocke, that in thy blest armes doest infold her, Witnes my heart as firme as you do hold her. And now goodnight thou set sunne beauties, neuer, Neuer more to be seene, goodnight for euer, Thou siluer forehead and thou golden haire, My best, my onely treasure when you were, You snowy plaines, and you faire modest dies, You liuing stars, but now two quenched lights, Whose fall, heauens stars with feared ruine frights. You eyebrowes, which like Rainbowes two appeare; A miracle, Rainebowes on skie so cleare. And all you vnseene beauties softly rest, Sleepe, quiet sleepe you in this stony chest, I cannot long; I will not long be from you, Shortly i'le come and in this rockie bed Slumber with my Olinda, with Olinda I'le sleepe my fill, meane time as neere as may be, Here rest mine eyes, rest close by your Olinda. He lies downe by the rocke. Harke, harke; Arion, thou choice Musician, Sing mee a note that may awake pale death, Such as may moue deafe Hell, and Stygian Ioue, Such as once OrpheusâO I am idle, idle: Sleep, sleep, mine eyes, this short releasement take you, Sleepe, sleepe for euer; neuer more awake you. Her face your obiect neuer more shall be, Sleepe then, vaine eyes, why should you wish to see? Scen. 2. The Rocke opens: Enter Olinda led by Glaucus and Circe: they retire leauing Olinda. Song. Olin. Thou worthiest daughter of the greatest light, Most powerfull Circe, and then honour'd Glaucus, What dutie a poore fisher maid may giue you, In thankes, and vowes, and holy offerings, Shall still be ready at your sacred altars. Thalander, now to thee, what sacrifice? What offerings may appease thy wronged loue? What haue I but my selfe? ah worthlesse prize Of such, so tryed, and so vnmou'd a faith. Ah, could I spend my body, weare my soule, And then resume another soule and body, And then consume that soule and body for thee, All would not pay the vse of halfe my debt. How pale he lookes, how strangely alter'd! Is he not dead? no, no, his pulse is quicke, His heart is strong, and rising, in his heate, Threatens with strokes, my churlish hand to beate: Nature, how couldst in one so firmely tie Perpetuall motion to fixt constancy? How can this wonder fall in Notion, A heart vnmou'd, yet still in motion! Alas he weepes, I hope his griefe and feares Swimme fast away in those sad streaming teares. Th'ast mourn'd enough, more iustly may I weepe, Leaue me thy teares, rest thou and sweetely sleepe. Thalander starts vp. Tha. Morpheus, one more such dreame shall buy me. Where, where art, Olinda? whither, whither flyest thou? Olin. Nay whither flies Thalander? here's Olinda: Tell mee why wak'd the substance thou eschewest, Whose shadowe in a dreame thou gladly viewest. Tha. Thou fairest shadow of a Nymph more faire, Death yet I see cannot thy light impaire. Olin. Thou dreamest still Thalander! Tha. Ah too too true; For such a sight wake shall I neuer viewe. Olin.

If thou art dead, faire hand, how doest reuiue mee? Olin. Thalander, heart and hand had now beene cold but for, Glaucilla, she preuenting Cosma, temperd the poysonous viall, changing death for sleepe, so gaue mee life, thee loue. Tha. Alcippus, art thou there? thou art my freind I prethee tell mee true, true Alcippus! doest thou not see Olinda? Al. I see her in your hand. Tha. Art sure tis she? tell me, are wee aliue? Art sure we wake? are we not both mistaken? If now I sleepe, O let me neuer waken. Al. If you would surely know, trie if shee breathe, Tha. Thy hand liues: doe thy lips liue too Olinda! Alcippus, shee liues and breathes, Alcippus: And with that sugred bread my heart both fir'd, And life and loue with thousand ioyes inspir'd. Ah my Olinda. Olind. My deare, my deare Thalander. Tha. Ist possible thou liu'st? ist sure I hold thee? These happy armes shall neuer more vnfold thee. Olin. Tell mee, my loue, canst thou such wrongs forgiue mee? Tha. My ioy, my soule. Olin. I neuer more will grieue you. Canst thou forget my hate, my former blindnes? If not, boldly reuenge my rash vnkindnes. Pierce this vile heart my soules vngratefull center, Pierce with thy dart where loues dart could not enter. Tha. For thy defence my hand shall still attend thee, My hand and heart, but neuer to offend thee: The only penance that I enioyne thee euer, Is that wee liue and loue and ioy together. Thinke not my hand will sacriledge commit, To breake this temple where all Graces sit. Olin. True, true my loue, tis vow'd a temple now, Where euer shall be worshipt loue and thou. Al. You happie paire, since Cosma's spight's defeated, And Magoe's charmes, and death by loue is cheated, Why stand you here? tis time from hence to moue: This was the bedde of death, and not of loue. Death hath his part of night, loue challengeth The rest, loue claimes the night as well as death. Tha. What sayes my loue? Olin. What my Thalander, euer With thee to life or death, but from thee neuer. Al. This halfe perswades mee to become a louer. Exeunt. Where better could her loue then here haue neasted? Or he his thoughts more daintily haue feasted? Manet Alcippus. Scen. 3. Enter Tyrinthus and Gryphus. Tyr. Knowst thou Perindus sister, or Olinda? Al. I know them both sir. Tyr. Liue they yet and breathe? Al. They liue and now most happy. Exit Alcippus. Tyr. Thou mak'st me happy, in thy happy newes. All thankes yee heauenly powers, when I forget Your goodnesse in my childrens life and safety, Let heauen forget both me and mine for euer. Gryphus, backe to our shippe, and fetch mee thence The vestments vowd to Neptune, and the chest, Wherein I lockt my other offerings. Exit Gryphus. This rocke my heart prefers before a palace. Fond men that haue enough yet seeke for more, I thought by traffique to encrease my store, And striuing to augment this carefull pelfe, I lost my goods, my liberty, my selfe: Taken by Persians on the GrÃ¦cian seas, So I my captaine and the King did please, Soone was I loosed from my slauish band, And straight preferd to haue a large command, There haue I now consum'd these thrice fiue summers, There might I haue liu'd long in wealth and honour, But ah thou little home, how in thy want The world so spacious, yet seemes too too scant! At my departure hence I left two infants, Perindus and Olinda, the boy some eyght, The girle but two yeeres old, their mother dead, Who giuing life to'th' girle, so tooke her death, And left her owne, to giue her infant breath. Great Ioue and Neptune, I will keepe my vowes, Seeing my Children liue, two chosen bulls, With mirtle crownd, and Oake leaues laid with gold, Shall fall vpon your altars. Enter Pas. Pas. You sacred vertues, truth and spotlesse fayth, Where will you liue, if not in such a Nymph? Whose brest will you now seeke? what mansion? Tyr. My trembling heart doth some great ill diuine, And tels me, euery griefe and feare is mine. Pas. VVhere now can vnsuspected friendship rest? If treachery possesse so faire a brest. Tyr. Fishers what newes? Pas. Sir, little as concernes you. Tyr. Pray heauens it doe not. Pas. Your habit speakes a stranger, And yet me thinkes, I somewhat else haue seene, Some lineaments of that face: are you Tyrinthus? Tyr. The same. Pas. O cruell heauens! could you finde No other time, to giue him backe his country? If thus you giue, happy whom you deny, The greater good, the greater iniury: Thy onely daughter Tyr. Is dead. Tyrinthus falls. Pas. I should haue sayd so. Alas, he falls. Tyrinthus, what, one blow thus strike thee vnder fortunes feete? How loth his life returnes! Tyr. How well I had forgot my griefe, And found my rest, with losse of restlesse life! Thou much hast wrong'd me, fisher, 'tis no loue, Death from his iust possession to remoue: Heauens, ye haue thankes for both, yet one you slue, Giue backe halfe of thy thankes, take but your due: I owe you nothing for Olinda, nothing. Ah poore Olinda: I shall neuermore, Neuer more see thee: thy father must lament thee, Thy father, who in death should long preuent thee, How long since died shee? Pas. With the last sunne she fell. Tyr. Sure heauens, ye mocke me: alas, what victory? What triumph in an old mans misery? VVhen you haue wonne, what conquest, that you slue A wretch that hated his life as much as you? Pas. Sir, you forget your selfe: to warre with heauen, Is no lesse fond, then dangerous. Tyr. Tell me fisher, haue you a child? Pas. No sir. Tyr. No maruell then Thou blam'st my griefe, of which thou hast no sence: First lose a child, then blame my patience. Pas. If thou be grieu'd, this is no way to ease it, Sooner we anger heauen, then thus appease it. Try. But when the heart such weight of sorrow beares, It speakes from what it feeles, and what it feares. Died she by a naturall, or by violent meanes? Pas. Nature refuses an office so vnnaturall. Tyr. Hard fate, most fitly were you women made: Since fate vnmercifull, vnmoued stands, VVell was lifes distaffe put in womens hands. Kild by a man? Pas. No man was so vnnaturall. Tyr. A woman! Pas. Yes. Tyr. Fit instrument of women: what was the weapon? Pas. The cowards weapon, poyson. Tyr. Canst tell the murderers name? Pas. Her name Glaucilla: A Nymph thought absolute, though now infected, That heauen it selfe might sooner bee suspected. Tyr. Tell me the circumstance. Pas. 'Twill but more grieue you. Tyr. True, but 'tis pitty in vnhelpt distresse, Condemned soules with all the weight to presse. Pas. Olinda this last night complain'd to Cosma, (A Nymph which lately came from faire Messena) That this Glaucillaes powerfull charmes had fir'd her, And with Thalanders loue now dead, inspir'd her With such a feeling griefe, her griefe lamenting, That she, to helpe so desperate loue consenting, Gaue her a water which she oft did proue, Would eyther quench or ease the paines of loue, Which Cosma swore, the other nere denyed. Glaucilla chang'd, Olinda dranke and dyed. DicÃ¦us hearing thisâ Tyr. Liues then DicÃ¦us? Pas. As well and iust as euer. Tyr. His life doth somewhat mend My childs sad death, after a child, a friend. Pas. DicÃ¦us by this euidence condemnes her By'th' law, from that high rocke to fall, and she With smiling welcom'd death, and quietly Steal'd to the rocke from whence shee must be cast. Wonder so heauie guilt should flye so fast! She led her leaders to that deepe descending, The guilty drawes the guiltlesse to their ending: And thus I left them, and with her iust DicÃ¦us, To see her execution, who goes not from her, Till from the rocke, in seas she leaue her breath, Die must she as she kild, water her crime and death. Tyr. Ah my poore Olinda! had I seene thee yet And clos'd thine eyes, alas my poore Olinda! Pas. This griefe is vaine and can no more reuiue her, you lose your teares. Tyr. When that I hold most deare is euer lost, poore losse to lose a teare. Pas. Your sonne striues, the good which heau'n bereaues you, You quickly see, but see not what it leaues you. Tyr. Art sure he liues? Pas. Two houres since, sad I left him, But safe. Tyr. What chances happen in an houre? By this he may be dead and buried. But yet Perindus, if thou liuing be, My halfe ioy liues, my halfe ioy dies in thee. Scen. 2. Enter Cancrone and Scrocca bound: Nomicus the Priest. Can. Ah Scrocca, thou hast often heard me say, it would be my lucke to be deuoured; and to tell thee true, I euer fear'd those Cyclops most; I neuer had any minde to them. Scr. Why Cancrone, this is the slauery on't, had wee beene Master fishers, we should neuer haue beene troubled to climbe vp these Mountaines, wee should neuer haue beene cast to our old acquaintance the fish. Tyr. Fisher, knowst thou these men? Pas. I know the men, but not their meaning. Can. That would neuer haue angred me, thou knowst wee haue fed vpon fish this many yeere, and for vs to haue made them one merry meale, had beene but the signe of a thankefull nature, but ah those Ctclops, clops, clops. Scrocca, I cannot digest them. Scr. I feare they will gest vs well enough. Can. And yet I care not much if I were sure to be eaten vp by that Cyclops that ate vp my grandsire, for then I might haue some hope to see the good old man once againe before I die. Scr. I care not whose hands I fall into, I'me sure hee shall haue no sweete bitte of mee now; nothing grieues mee, but that hauing done but one good deede in all my life, I must die for that. Nom. Thou foolish fisher, thinkst it good to stop The course of iustice, and breake her sword, the Law? By Law thou liu'st: hee iustly death deserues, VVho that destroyes, which him and his preserues. Tyr. Are not these my old men, Scrocca and Cancrone? Scr. VVell sir, you may say what you will, but if wee liue by the Law, how commeth it to passe, that we must die by the Law? Can. Mee thinks I see how busie Rimronce will bee about me: he surely will be vpon my backe, for my being vpon his, a while a goe. Scr. Nay Cancrone, thou diest for sauing thy master too. Tyr. Ay me, my sonne? Can. I haue no minde to climbe these Mountaines, I begin to bee short-winded already, I shall neuer hold out; had I thought it would haue come to this, I would haue bene vilely tempted to ha let my Master drowne quickly. Scr. What, man? thou could'st neuer haue done thy Master better seruice then to dye for him, nay, if Perindus liue, I care not. Tyr. Perindus? I can hold no longer, friend, who is thy Master? why art thou manacled? Scr. Mantled hither! marry this Priest hath mantled vs for sauing our Master Perindus. Tyr. Ay me, my sonne. Can. Vds fish, old Master, where haue you beene this 20 yeeres and more; Nom. Tyrinthus! at such a time! sir, your arriuall is eyther very happy, or else most haplesse, eyther to see, or else preuent a danger. Tyr. Priest, how is my Perindus? Nom. Doom'd to die. Tyr. What is the cause? Nom. His will. Tyr. Who could perswade him? Nom. She who most stroue to hinder and disswade him. Tyr. What had he done? Nom. That which deserues all life and loue. Tyr. How fine the heauens powers can sorrowes frame! The fates will play, and make my woe their game. VVhere is he? Can. Safe enough I warrant you, get's leaue of the Priest, master, and wee'l goe fetch him. Scr. We caught him out of the water. Can. O, he had supt a bundance of fair porridge! Scr. And brought him to the shippe where the mariners keepe him. Tyr. VVhy stand I idle here! O to the shore i'le fly, And eyther with him liue, or for him die. Can. Master, master, master. Exit Tyrinthus. Pas. Ile follow him: nature can doe no lesse Then eyther helpe, or pitty such distresse. Exit Pas. Can. Nay if you goe too, then farewell all, Farewell ye rockes, farewell to thee O loue, You louely rockes, you hard and rocky loue. Nay I shall turne swaine presently and sing my finall song. Nom. I maruell what it is that stayes DicÃ¦us. Con. Marry let him stay till I send for him, the Cyclops shall want their breakefast this month. Nom. Here I must stay for him. Scen. 5. Enter Cosma. Cos. Faine would I know how my ginne thriues and prospers. Olinda is fast, and by my disamour hath quencht her loue with death: if now Glaucilla bee taken in that snare, then am I cunning: well may I proue a fisher, who haue tooke too maides so soone with one selfe baite and hooke. Is not that Nomicus? I shall learne of him. Nomicus? Nom. Who Cosmo? Cos. Why are these fishers bound? Con. For you. Cos. For mee? Can. I for you, had not you cus'd Glaucialla, shee had not bene condemnd: if shee had not beene condemnd, Perindus would not haue died for her: if he would not haue died for her, he had not fallen from the rocke: had he not fallen from the rocke, we had not sau'd him: if wee had not sau'd him, wee had not beene bound: were wee not bound, wee would showe a faire payre of heeles, Cos. What talks this foole? Perindus falne from the rocke! Nom. Hast thou not heard then of Perindus faith and fall? Cos. No, not a word; but faine would heare. Nom. And shalt: my tongue is as ready as thy eare; Meane while leade these away, soone as DicÃ¦us returnes, I'le ouertake you. Can. I prethee Mr Priest, let mee craue one fauour; that I may haue an Epitaph for mee in Neptunes church porch, Ile neuer goe farther. Nom. Heres no time for Epitaphs, away. Can. Nay, tis soone done, Ile trouble neuer a poet of them all, I haue it already. Cancrone valorous and kind, where art thou? Cancrone too kind and valorous to liue, Ingulft in Cyclops guts. Readers, why start you? His life for his master he did freely giue. Vngratefull Sicelie that want'st his bones, Instead of members keeping his memorie in stones. Short and sweete, Mr Priest. Scr. Cancrone, this is a land voyage, you must leade the way. Can. But when wee saile downe the Cyclops throat, Ile giue you the preeminence. Exeunt. Nom. After that haplesse Nymph had heard her doome, As shee was led to'th' rocke, i'th' middle way, Perindus flying fast, calls out, Stay: And for he thought his feete too slowly bore him, Before he came, he sent his voyce before. Stay, stay, DicÃ¦us, th'art a man, I see, And well mayst erre heauens not more pure then she. Yet since the doome is past i'le, pawne my breath, And make your fact losse hanious by my death: I'le lose her life in me, and she shall spend My life in her, so both shall better end. Cos. This was no ill newes to the Nymph. Nom. Yes, yes: then first she thought her selfe condemnd, Death in him shee fear'd and in herselfe contemnd. That law it selfe (says shee) should suffer death, Which one condemnes, another punnisheth. True, sayes Perindus, my life, my all's in thee, When thou offendst, why shouldst thou punish me? But briefe to giue their words in short contracted, VVas neuer part of loue more louely acted: Both loath to liue, and both contend to die, VVhere onely death stroue for the victory. Meane time I could but weepe, nor I alone, That two such loues should die, not liue in one. Cos. Their spotlesse fayth's a cristall, where I see Too late my cancred hates deformity. Nom. At length the law it selfe decides the strife, That he with losse of his might buy her life. Then and but then she, wept, and to preuent him, Downe fell shee with a deadly looke and eye, Acting the prologue of his tragedy, And wak'd againe, she 'gan to chide and raue, And vowes to liue no further then his graue; VVhile he with cheerfull steps the rockes ascending: Fearelesse beholds his death, that steepe descending, And boldly standing on the vtmost browe, Thus spake: Poore life, I neuer knew thy worth till now, How thou art ouer valewed to pay Her life with thine, gold with base alcumy. Cos. Iust, iust, you heauens, I haue set a gin For them, and now my selfe the first am in. Nom. Then turning to his loue, thus spake his last: Farewell Glaucilla, liue and in thy brest As in a heauen my loue and life shall rest: Seeke not by death thy selfe from griefe to free, Remember now Perindus liues in thee. Cherish my heart, which in thy heart doth lye, For whilst thou liu'st, Perindus cannot dye: So leapt he lightly from the cloudy rocke. Cos. Is hee then dead? Nom. No: for the guilty sea With soft embraces wrapt his limbes; It seemes the waues moou'd with Sympathy, Would teach vnhumane men humanity. Though they could not preuent, would ease his fall; And not consenting to his pious death, Restor'd him vp againe to aire and breath: Briefly, those two his seruants not regarding, DicÃ¦us threatning voyce, and iust awarding, With him tooke vp his guilt, and to a shippe That rides in the hauen safe conuayd him, there They left him now reuiu'd, themselues were taken And as the law commands, were doom'd to suffer The death of slaues: both to be strongly bound, And in those hils left to the greedy Cyclops: And now the stay is onely in DicÃ¦us, At whose returne they suffer, iust they dye, Who loue their master more then equity. Cos. O lawlesse loue! this soule offence, Which when it prosperd, pleasd my rauish't sence: With what a drie aspect, what horrid sight, Now done, it fils my soule with guilty fright, Who ere thou art, if in thy spotlesse brest, Thy vndefiled thoughts doe quiet rest: Wake them not, and let no blood-hound with thee dwell, These murthering thoughts are like the mouth of hell, Into whose yawning 'tis more easie neuer To fall, then falne, to cease from falling euer. Enter Pas. Pas. Nomicus, thou now mayst let thy prisoners free, Thalander to Olinda now reuiu'd, Perindus to Glaucilla are to be married, And all are brought along with singing, Hymen the shores, Hymen the ecchoes ringing. Namicus, seest thou this Nymph? ah couldst thou thinke That treason, enuy, murder, spight and hell, All hell it selfe in such a heauen could dwell? This is the knot of all these sorrowes; Cosma, If not for shame, why yet for spight or fashion, For womans fashion let some teares bee spilt: A sea of weeping will not wash thy guilt. Nom. Great nature, that hast made a stone descry Twixt meaner natures, checking baser metalls, Which proudly counterfeit the purer gold, Why hast thou left the soule of man no touch-stone, To iudge dissemblance, and descry proud vice, Which with false colours seemes more vertuous Then vertues selfe? like to some cunning workeman, Who frames a shape in such a forme of stature, That oft he excells by imitating nature. He that should looke vpon this Nymphs sweete eye, Would vow't a temple sworne to purity. Pas. If murder rest in such a louely grace, Here do I vow neuer to trust a face. Shall I call backe your Prisoners? Nom. Prethee doe: Our nets, boates, oares, and hookes shall now goe play, For heauen hath sworne to make this holy day. Scen. 6. Enter DicÃ¦us, Tyrinthus, Thalander, Olinda, Perindus, Glaucilla, Alcippus, Chorus. Song. Hymen, Hymen, come safe on, Hymen. That I loue for euer constant stands, Where hearts are tied before the hands, Where faire vertue marries beauty, And affection pleads for duty: Hymen, Hymen, come safe on Hymen. Al. You honourd paire of fishers, see where your loue, So full of constant triall now hath brought you, See, blessed soules, through so many teares, Turnings, despaires, impossibilities, Your loue is now most safe arriu'd: Thalander, Is this the Nymph, whom heauen and angry hell, Her cold desires, and colder death it selfe Would haue deuoured from thy deseruing loue? Thalander, these hands are thine, that heauenly face, Those starrie eyes, those roses and that grace, Those corrall lips, and that vnknowne brest, And all the hidden riches of the rest: They all are thine, thine is the faire Olinda. Yet thou, as thou wast wont, all sad and heauy. Tha. Blame me not, friend: for yet I seeme forsaken And doubt I sleepe, and feare still to be waken. Enter Pas, with Cancrone and Scrocca. Cos. Now is the time of pardon. Ye happie maids, Your loue in spight of all tempestuous seas, Is safe arriu'd, and harbors in his ease, And all those stormes haue got but this at last, To sweeten present ioyes with sorrowes past. Blessed Olinda, thou hast got a loue Equall to heauen, and next to highest Ioue. Glaucilla, thy losse thou now dost full recouer. Ah you haue found (too seldome sound) a louer. Then doe not her too rigorously reproue, For louing those whom you yet better loue. Olin. For vs, we iudge not of your hard intent, But reckon your ioyes fatall instrument. DicÃ¦. Yet this her penance: Cosma, marke thy censure, Whom most thou shouldest loue, thou shalt loue neuer Dote thou on dotards, they shall hold thee euer: The best and wisest neuer shall respect thee, Thou onely fooles, fooles onely shall affect thee. Loose now those prisoners; so forward to the temple. Exit Chorus. Can. Ha braue Iudge, now Mistris mine, I must confesse. Cos. This charme begins to worke already, I loue this foole, and doate vpon him more, Then euer vpon any man before: Well, I must be content thus to be curst And yet of louers, fooles are not the worst. For nowsoeuer boyes doe hoote and flout them, The best and wisest oft haue fooles about them. Can. I and many a fooles bable too, I warrant thee. Sweete heart, shall we goe to bedde? Cos. What, in the morning? Can. Morning? tis night. Cos. Thou art a foole indeede, seest not the sunne? Can. Why that's a candle or the moone, I prethee let's goe to bed. Cos. Content; no time vnfit for play, Loue knowes no difference twixt night and day. Can. Nay, all the play's done, gentles, you may goe, I haue another play within to doe. Riddle me, Riddle me, what's that? My play is worke enough; my worke is play, I see to worke i'th' night, and rest 'ith' day: Since then my play and worke is all but one, Well may my play begin, now yours is done. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGVS. As in a Feast, so in a Comedy, Two sences must be pleasd in both the eye, In feasts, the eye and taste must be inuited, In Comedies, the eye and eare delighted: And he that onely seekes to please but eyther, While both he doth not please, he pleaseth neyther. What euer feast could euery guest content, When as t'each man each taste is different? But lesse a Scene, where nought but as 'tis newer, Can please, where guests are more, and dishes fewer: Yet in this thought, this thought the Author casd, Who once made all, all rules, all neuer pleasd.
