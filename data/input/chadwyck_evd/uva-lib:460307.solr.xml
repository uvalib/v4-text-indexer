      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. ARCTURUS. With Him, who sways all nations, sea and earth, I dwell in fellowship, a denizen Of heav'n's high city, the abode of Gods. I'm, as you see, a fair and splendid star, Keeping my regular and fixed course On earth here, and in heav'n: my name Arcturus. By night I shine in heav'n among the Gods, And in the day-time mix with mortal men, Passing, with other stars, from heav'n to earth. Jove, supreme sovereign of Gods and men, Spreads us throughout all nations several ways, To mark the people's actions, learn their manners, Their piety and faith, that so each man May find reward according to his virtues. Those, who suborn false witnesses to gain A villainous suit in law, who shuffle off Due payments by false swearing, we return Their names in writing to high Jove: each day He is inform'd of those that call for vengeance, And seek their own perdition by their crimes. Whoe'er by perjury obtain their cause, Or bribe the judge to an unfair decision, The case adjudg'd he judges o'er again, And does amerce them in a larger fine Than they were 'vantag'd by the foul decree. In other registers are noted down The upright and the good.—Yet wicked men Fondly imagine they can Jove appease With gifts and sacrifice; and thus they lose Their labour and their cost: for no petition Is acceptable to him from bad men. He that is good and just, will sooner find Grace from above, in praying to the Gods, Than will the wicked. Therefore I advise you, You that are just and good, who pass your days In piety and virtue, persevere, That so you may rejoice from all your doings. Now will I tell the subject of our Play, Which is my errand hither.—First of all Know, Diphilus has nam'd this place Cyrene; There in a neighbouring villa, on that spot (Pointing Adjoining to the sea, dwells Dæmones, A good old gentleman, who hither fled From Athens; not that any misdemeanour Forc'd him to leave his country, but himself By saving others was involv'd in ruin: By gentle courtesy his means were wasted. He had a daughter when a little child Kidnap'd away, whom a girl-merchant bought, A villainous knave, and brought her to Cyrene. A young Athenian spark, now of this city, Saw her returning from the musick-school, And grew enamour'd of her: strait he comes To the girl-merchant, bargains for the wench At thirty Minæ, gives him earnest, binds him Moreover with an oath. The merchant, like A villain as he is, car'd not a rush For honour, honesty, or all he swore. He had a certain guest, like to himself, A villainous old rascal,—a Sicilian, From Agrigentum,—of so vile a stamp, That he was even traitor to his country. This rogue extols the beauty of the girl, And of the other damsels, which our merchant Held in possession, and, in short, persuades him, To go with him to Sicily: “There,” says he, “The men are debauchees; there you may soon “Grow rich; there damsels bear the best of prices.” Well,—he prevails. A ship is hir'd by stealth; All that he had our merchant puts on board By night; and tells the youth, that bought the girl, He's going to perform a vow to Venus.— (Pointing) This is her temple, where he has invited The spark to dinner.—Presently he gets On board, and carries all his damsels with him. The young man was inform'd from other hands, How matters were transacted, how the merchant Was fairly gone: he hastens to the port; But now the vessel was far off at sea. I, seeing that the girl was borne away, Brought her relief, and ruin to her owner. I rais'd a hurricane, and stir'd the billows: For I Arcturus am, of all the signs, Most turbulent; outrageous, when I rise, And at my setting more outrageous.—Now The merchant and his comrade are both cast Upon a rock, their ship dash'd all in pieces. The maid, affrighted, and a damsel with her, Have leap'd into the boat, and now the surge Drives them aloof off from the rock to land, Close to the old man's villa, which the storm Has stript of all it's tiles, and quite uncover'd it. This is the servant, that is coming forth. The spark, that bought the damsel of the merchant, Will presently arrive, and you shall see him. Now fare ye well, and heartless be your foes!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter SCEPARNIO, with a spade, as going to work. Have mercy on us! what a dreadful storm Has Neptune sent us over-night!—The wind Our whole house has uncover'd.—In a word, It was no wind;—but 'twas the rattling peal In the Alcmena of Euripides. Troth, it has stript the roof, tore all the tiles off,— Made our house lighter,—giv'n it store of windows. SCENE II. Enter PLEUSIDIPPUS, talking to three friends at a distance. I have withdrawn you from your own concerns;— Nor has the purpose speeded, for which cause I brought you out with me.—I could not find This villainous procurer at the port.— Yet I'm unwilling to forego all hope Through my remissness:—Wherefore I have still, My friends, detain'd you for some longer space.— To Venus' temple am I now come hither, Where, he inform'd me, he design'd to sacrifice. Scep. (at a distance, falling to work.) 'Twere best to set about this plaguy clay here, Though I am work'd to death by't. Pleus. Sure I hear Some voice or other near me. SCENE III. Enter DÆMONES from his House. Ho! Sceparnio! Scep. Who calls me by my name? Dæm. Why, he that bought you, Scep. That is to say, you are my master.—(turning) Dæmones! Dæm. Come, dig away; much stuff will be requir'd; For, as I find, the whole house must be cover'd: It has as many holes in't as a sieve. Pleus. (advancing) Save you good father!—Save you both together! Dæm. Save you! Scep. (digging) But are you man or woman, you Who call him father? Pleus. Sure, I am a man. Dæm. Then seek elsewhere a father.—I had once An only daughter, and I lost that one:— I never had a son. Pleus. Pray heav'n may send— Scep. (still digging) Send you a mischief, whosoe'er you are, That seeing us employ'd would give us more Employment with your chattering. Pleus. Dwell ye here? Scep. Why do you ask?—What! you survey the premises, That you may come and plunder bye-and-bye. Pleus. That slave should be a trusty and a rich one, Who lets his tongue run in his master's presence, And dares in scurvy terms address a free-man. Scep. And he should be a filthy knave, a foul one, An impudent base fellow, who will come Of his own motion to another's house, That owes him nothing. Dæm. Peace, Sceparnio. (to Pleus.) Prithee, Good youth, what would you? Pleus. I would ill to him For his unmanner'd haste to speak the first, When that his master's by.—But, sir, an't please you, I'd ask in brief one question. Dæm. I'll attend you, Though I am busied. Scep. (to Pleus.) Go into the marsh, Wilt thou? and cut some reeds to thatch our house with, While it is fair. Dæm. (to Scep.) Peace. (to Pleus.) Tell me what's your pleasure? Pleus. Inform me what I ask you.—Have you seen E'er a grey-headed, frizzle-pated fellow, A scurvy, perjur'd knave, a fawning cogger? Dæm. Full many an one:—by reason of such men I now alas! live miserable. Pleus. He, I speak of, brought two damsels with him here,— To-day or yesterday,—to Venus' temple, In order to prepare a sacrifice. Dæm. I have seen no one sacrificing there. These many days.—Nor can they sacrifice Without my knowledge: Here they always come For water, fire, or vessels, or a knife, Spit, seething-pot, or something; in a word, My well, my vessels are for Venus' use More than my own:—But now, for many days, There has been intermission. Pleus. What you say Tells me I'm ruin'd. Dæm. 'Tis no fault of mine. Scep. Hearkye me,—you, sir,—you that roam about To temples for your belly's sake,—'twere best Order your dinner to be got at home: Belike you was invited yon to dinner, And he, who ask'd you, never came. Pleus. (angrily) Most excellent! Scep. E'en take thee home then with an empty belly; There's nothing hinders.—Thou should'st rather be A follower of Ceres than of Venus: Love's her concern, but food is Ceres' care. Pleus. How scurvily this fellow dares to treat me! Dæm. (looking towards the sea.) O ye good Gods! Who are those people yonder Nigh to the shore, Sceparnio?—Look. Scap. Methinks They've been invited to a parting dinner. Dæm. Why so? Scep. Because they've bath'd them after supper. Their vessel's gone to pieces. Dæm. So it is. Scep. And so indeed our house too and its tiles Are shatter'd upon land. Dæm. Alas! alas! What nothings are poor mortal men!—See! see! They are dash'd overboard! Look, how they swim! Pleus. I pray, where are they? Dæm. (pointing.) This way, to the right,— D'ye see them?—near the shore. Pleus. I see them.— (To his Companions) Follow me. Would it were He I seek, that worst of villains! Fare ye well. Scep. Of ourselves we should have look'd To that without your bidding. [Exit Pleusidippus and friends. SCENE IV. SCEPARNIO and DÆMONES. SCEPARNIO, (looking towards the sea.) O Palæmon, Neptune's associate, (nay, thou'rt call'd his partner,) What do I see? Dæm. What do you see? Scep. I see Two women sitting in a boat alone.— Poor creatures, how they're tost!—That's good,—that's good,— Well done!—See! the surge drives the boat away there Off from the rock towards the shore!—a pilot Could not have done it.—In my life, I think, I never saw such billows.—They are safe, If they can 'scape those waves.—Now, now's the danger! One is wash'd overboard,—but she is lighted Upon a flat;—she'll easily wade through it.— O bravo! bravo!—See, the surge has thrown her Upon the land!—She's risen,—makes this way:— All's safe.—The other too has leap'd on shore! Ha! thro'her fright she's fall'n upon her knees Into the sea!—Oh,—she is safe,—has got Out of the water,—and is now on land.— But she has taken to the right;—poor creature! She'll wander there all day. Dæm. What's that to you? Scep. If she should topple from yon cliff, which now She's making to, she'll briefly put an end At once to all her rambling. Dæm. If you mean To sup with Them this evening, it behoves you To be concern'd about them; but if me You think to eat with, you must mind my business. Scep. O to be sure. Dæm. Then follow me. Scep. I follow. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Enter PALÆSTRA, from among the Cliffs, at a distance. The storied miseries of men's mishaps (How sad soe'er relation sets them forth) Are far less sharp than those we know and feel Ourselves from sore experience.—Has it then Pleas'd heav'n to cast me on this stranger shore, With these drench'd garments, frighted and forlorn? Shall I not cry,—“Why was I born to bear This load of misery?”—Is this the meed Of my distinguish'd piety?—With ease I might endure this labour of affliction, If I had borne me impious to the Gods, Or to my parents.—But if studiously I've sought to shun that trespass, then, ye Gods, You've dealt with me unfittingly, unjustly. How, how will you requite henceforth the impious, If at this rate you prize the innocent?— Were I but conscious that in any thing My parents or myself had done amiss, It less had griev'd me.—But my owner's crimes Have wrought this woe; for his impiety I'm punish'd.—He has lost his ship and all, Wreck'd in the sea;—And I, the sad remains Of all that he possess'd:—the damsel too,— She that came with me in the boat,—is perish'd.— At least had She been sav'd, her gentle aid Had sooth'd and lighten'd my affliction.—Now What hope, what help, what comfort can I find? Here am I in this lonely desart; here Stand rocks;—here roars the sea;—no living wight Comes 'cross my way;—the cloaths that I have on Are all my riches; and I'm mainly ignorant How to get food, or where to find a shelter.— Have I an Hope, that I should wish to live?— I am a stranger, a new comer hither:— Would I could meet with some one, that might shew me A path or road:—my mind is all uncertain Whither to make,—to this way or to that.— No cultivated land I see before me.— Ah, my poor parents! little do you know, I'm now the wretch I am.—By birth I'm free:— But what avails that freedom? Am I now Less wretched than if born a slave?—Ah me! I never was a comfort or an help To those, who gave me birth and education. SCENE VI. Enter AMPELISCA, coming forward from among the Cliffs, at the other End of the Stage. Can I do better? were't not for my good To put an end at once to my existence? I am so wretched, and so many cares Distract my breast, that weary out my soul!— I'm prodigal of life; for I have lost That hope, which was my comfort.—All around In quest I've rambled, crawl'd with patient step Through ev'ry covert place, with voice, eyes, ears Trying to trace her out, my fellow-slave. Yet no-where can I find her!—I am puzzled Which way to take, or where to seek her further. I cannot meet a soul, that I might question:— Never was place so desart and forlorn As these dread wilds!—yet will I not desist From searching, till at length I've found her out, If haply she's alive. Pal. (at a distance.) What voice is that Sounds near me? Amp. (overhearing.) I am mightily afraid.— Who speaks there? Pal. I beseech you, gentle Hope, O come to my assistance— Amp. 'Tis a woman;— A woman's voice.— Pal. And free me from my dread. Amp. (listening.) Sure 'tis a woman's voice, that strikes my ear. Pal. Is it Ampelisca? Amp. Is it you, Palæstra? Pal. Why don't I call her by her name aloud, That she may know me? (calling.) Ampelisca! Ama. Ha! Who's that? Pal. 'Tis I,—Palæstra. Amp. Say, where are you? Pal. Environ'd with misfortunes. Amp. I'm your partner; Nor is my share of sorrow less than your's.— I long to see you. Pal. In that wish we're rivals. Amp. Our voices be our guides.—Where are you? Pal. Here.— Come forward,—here,—come meet me. Amp. I am coming. [They meet.] Pal. Give me your hand. Amp. Here,—take it. Pal. Prithee tell me, Are you alive? Amp. Aye, and would wish to live, Since 'tis permitted me to feel and touch you:— (They embrace.) O how you ease me now of all my troubles! Pal. You are before-hand, have prevented me In what I would have said.—But let us go. Amp. Go? whither, sweet? Pal. We'll keep along the shore. Amp. I'll follow where you please. Pal. And shall we roam In these wet garments? Amp. That which is befall'n us We must perforce endure.—But prithee now What's that? (looking.) Pal. What? Amp. Don't you see a temple yonder? There,—don't you see it? Pal. Where? Amp. Upon the right. Pal. It seems, 'tis deck'd unto some God. Amp. Then men Cannot be far off.—(They advance towards it.) And the site so charming!— I'll pray unto this God, whoe'er he be, That he would succour us poor, helpless wretches, And free us from our sorrows. [They kneel before the Temple. SCENE VII. Enter PTOLEMOCRATIA, Priestess of Venus, from the Temple. Who are these, That lowly bending to my Patroness Solicit her protection? For the voice Of some poor supplicants has drawn me hither. Their suit is to a good and gracious Goddess, A Patroness most gentle, and most kind. Pal. Save you, good mother! Ptol. Save you, my sweet girls! Whence do you come, so woefully array'd, In these wet garments? Pal. Lastly, from a place Not far from hence, but 'tis a great way off Whence we were borne at first. Ptol. Ye came forsooth By sea then. Pal. You judge right. Ptol. Ye should have come Cloathed in white, and bringing victims with you.— 'Tis not the practice to approach our temple In such habiliments. Pal. Ah! whence should we, We that were cast away, have got us victims? In need of succour, destitute of hope, In a strange land, we now embrace your knees: O let your roof receive and shelter us; Have pity on two hapless wanderers, Who have no place of refuge, no, nor hope, Nor any thing indeed but what you see. Ptol. Give me your hands: rise both: no woman ever Was more inclin'd to pity; but alas! My state is poor and mean: hardly indeed I get support, and for a livelihood I serve our Venus. Pal. Is this Venus' temple? Ptol. The same; and I'm her Priestess.—Such as 'tis, You shall find here a courteous entertainment, As far as my scant means will give me power.— Come then with me. Pal. You tender us, good mother, With a most kind affection. Ptol. 'Tis my duty. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter FISHERMEN, with their Lines, Nets, &amp;c. A Fisherman. We poor folks lead a sorry life, especially If we have learn'd no trade, no occupation, So of necessity must be content With what we have.—Guess ye, how rich we are By this our tackle. These poor hooks and rods Are all we have to live by. From the city We come here to the sea in quest of forage; Our sport and exercise is catching lobsters, Crabs, oysters, cockles, ev'ry kind of fish; Some with our hooks, some get we from the rocks. We draw all our provisions from the sea: If we catch nothing, then well sous'd and pickled We e'en sneak home, and sleep with empty bellies.— The sea is now so rough, we have no hope Of sport here; and except we get some shell-fish, We must go supperless.—We will beseech Good Venus here to favour and befriend us. [They advance towards the Temple. SCENE II. Enter TRACHALIO, at a little distance. I've us'd my best endeavours not to slip My master any where. When he went out, He said that he was going to the port, And bade me meet him here at Venus' temple.— But see, some people stand there opportunely, Of whom I may enquire. I'll up to them. Save you, ye sea-thieves, ye starv'd generation! How fares it with you? Fisherman. As with fishermen; Dying with hunger, thirst, and expectation. Trach. Have you seen come this way, since you've been here, E'er a fresh-colour'd, stout, well-looking youth, And three companions with him, drest like soldiers? Fish. We have seen no one answering your description. Trach. Or have you met an old bald-pated fellow, Hook-nos'd, pot-bellied, beetle-brow'd, squint-ey'd, A sour-fac'd knave, the scorn of Gods and men, Full of iniquity and vile dishonour, With two young likely damsels? Fish. Such an one In mind and deed is fitter for the gallows Than Venus' temple. Trach. Tell me, have you seen him? Fish. No,—no one has come hither.—Fare you well. Trach. Farewell. [Exeunt Fishermen. SCENE III. TRACHALIO alone. I thought so: 'tis as I suspected:— My master is deceiv'd; this curst procurer Is run away, has got on board a ship, And carried off the damsels.—I'm a conjurer.— My master was invited by the knave To dinner here: I had best stay his coming: And if I see the priestess, I'll enquire, If she can give me further information: She may perhaps know more. SCENE IV. Enter AMPELISCA from the Temple. (To the Priestess within.) I understand: Your orders are, to knock here at this house Next to the temple, and to ask for water. Trach. Whose voice is that? Amp. Bless me! who's that, that speaks there? Whom do I see? Trach. Is not that Ampelisca Comes from the temple? Amp. Is not that Trachalio I see there, Pleusidippus' rogue? Trach. 'Tis she. Amp. 'Tis he.—Trachalio! save you. Trach. Ampelisca! Save you.—How fares it? Amp. Very ill. Trach. Don't say so. Amp. 'Tis right to speak the truth.—But prithee now Where is your master Pleusidippus? Trach. Pshaw! As though he weren't within there. Amp. He is not, Nor any other man. Trach. He is not come! Amp. You say the truth. Trach. That's not my custom. But How near is dinner ready? Amp. Pray, what dinner? Trach. You're sacrificing here. Amp. What are you dreaming? Trach. Why sure your master Labrax did invite My master Pleusidippus here to dinner. Amp. No wonder what you say.—If he deceives Both Gods and men, he acts but like a pimp. Trach. Are you not sacrificing? nor my master? Amp. You've guess'd it. Trach. Prithee then what do you here? Amp. From dire afflictions, from severest frights, From hazard of our lives, in want of succour, The Priestess took us in, me and Palæstra. Trach. Ha! is Palæstra here, my master's love? Amp. Yes verily. Trach. There's pleasure in your news, My Ampelisca.—But I long to know The perils you were in. Amp. Our ship, Trachalio, Last night was cast away. Trach. Ship? cast away? What story's this? Amp. Have you not heard forsooth, How that our master privately design'd To carry us away to Sicily, And put on ship-board all that he was worth? Now all is lost. Trach. Thanks, gentle Neptune: verily Thou art a cunning gamester; thou hast giv'n him A pleasant cast i'faith: the rogue is done for.— But where's the villain now? Amp. Dead drunk, I fancy; For Neptune had invited him last night To deep potations, and, as I suppose, Gave him a finishing cup. Trach. O how I love thee, My Ampelisca! What a dear sweet creature! There's honey in thy words too!—But inform me, How scap'd you and Palæstra? Amp. You shall hear. Seeing the ship borne full upon a rock, We, sore affrighted, leapt into the boat: I hasten'd to untie the rope that held her; And while the rest were wrapt in wild dismay, Our boat was sever'd from them by the storm, Which drove us to the right; and in this wise, Poor helpless souls, tost by the winds and waves, We pass'd the live-long night, till on the morn The wind scarce bore us to the shore quite spent.— Trach. I understand;—'tis ever Neptune's way:— He's a most dainty Ædile, and whenever He finds commodities stark naught, the word At once is “over with them.” Amp. A plague on you! Trach. On you, my Ampelisca.—But I knew The scurvy pimp would do what he has done;— And I have often said it:—I had best Let my hair grow, and set up for a conjurer. Amp. A pretty care you took, with all your foresight, You and your master, to prevent his going! Trach. What could he do? Amp. A lover he, and ask you, What could he do? Day, night he should have kept A constant watch, been always upon guard. Yes truly,—'tis so like them,—his concern And care about her tallied with his love. Trach. Do you not know, when a man goes to bathe, Let him be e'er so mindful of his cloaths, They yet are stolen: for he can't devise Whom he should have an eye to; but the thief Holds easily his mark of observation Point blank before him: all the while our spark Kens not the lurking knave.—But bring me to her. Where is she, pray? Amp. Go straight into the temple: You'll find her sitting there, all drown'd in tears. Trach. I'm sorry for't!—but wherefore doth she weep? Amp. I'll tell you. She is vexed to the soul, That the procurer should have ta'en her casket, Where she had lodg'd some trinkets, which she hop'd Might lead to a discovery of her parents; And now she fears 'tis lost. Trach. Where was the casket? Amp. He lock'd it in his wallet, to prevent Discovery of her parents. Trach. What a shame To make a slave of one that should be free! Amp. She thinks it with the ship gone to the bottom. All the old fellow's treasure too was with it: Some one, I hope, has div'd, and brought it up: She is sore grieved for the loss of it. Trach. 'Tis fit that I should go and comfort her. But let her not despond; for true it is, Good oft befalls us, when we least expect it. Amp. And true it is, that when we trust in hope, We're often disappointed. Trach. Patience then Is the best remedy against affliction.— I'll in, except you want me further. Amp. Go. [Exit Trachalio. SCENE V. AMPELISCA alone. I'll now do what the Priestess order'd me; I'll beg some water here at the next house. She told me if I ask'd it in her name, They'd give it me forthwith. I never saw A worthier old woman, more deserving Favour from Gods and men. How courteously, And with what gentle breeding she receiv'd us Trembling, in want, wet, cast away, half-dead,— And treated us as though we were her children! How readily herself did warm us water For us to wash!—But I must mind her orders, That I mayn't make her wait. [Knocking at Dæmones' door. Ho! who's within here? Open the door.—Will nobody come forth? SCENE VI. Enter SCEPARNIO. Who's at the door there banging so unmercifully? Amp. 'Tis I. Scep. What good d'ye bring us?—By my troth A likely wench! Amp. Good day to you, young man. Scep. The same to you, young woman. Amp. I am come to you,— Scep. I'll entertain you, if you come anon, As you could wish: at present I have nothing To satisfy your wants.—Ah ha, my pretty one! My smirking, smiling rogue! (Offering to embrace her. Amp. Let me alone:— Fye,—now you are too rude. Scep. By heav'ns, the very Image of Venus! What a sparkling eye The jade has!—what a shape!—what a complexion!— A walnut,—a nut brown I meant to say!— What breasts!—what pretty pouting lips!— (Lays hold of her. Amp. (Struggling,) Be quiet!— I am not for your turn:—d'ye think me common? What!—can't you keep your hands off?— Scep. Prithee, sweet, May I not toy a little? Amp. Bye and bye,— When I'm at leisure, I'll then trifle with you:— Now let me have your answer, aye or no, To that which I was sent to ask. Scep. What would you? Amp. Can you not guess by this? (Pointing to the pitcher.) Scep. And can't you guess What I would have of you? Amp. The Priestess sent me To beg some water. Scep. I am proud and lordly: Unless you sue to me with low petition, You will not get a drop.—Our well we dug, At our own hazard, with our proper tools.— Unless you wooe me with much blandishment, You will not get a drop. Amp. Why should you grudge To give me water, which an enemy Will give an enemy? Scep. Why should you grudge To grant me that same favour, which a friend Will give a friend? Amp. Well, well, my sweet, I'll do All you desire. Scep. (Aside.) O charming!—I am blest!— She calls me sweet.— (To Amp.) You shall have water;—No, You shall not love in vain.—Give me the pitcher. Amp. Here,—take it.—Prithee, love, make haste, and bring it me. Scep. Stay:—I'll be here this instant, my sweet charmer! [Exit Sceparnio. SCENE VII. AMPELISCA alone. What shall I tell the Priestess in excuse For tarrying here so long?—Oh, how I dread Ev'n now to look upon the deep!— (Looking towards the Sea.) Ah me! What do I see there on the shore?—my master And his Sicilian guest, whom I believ'd Both drown'd!—More evil still survives to plague us Than we imagin'd.—Why do I not run Into the temple to inform Palæstra, That we may fly to th'altar ere he come, And seize us?—I'll be gone:—th'occasion presses, And suddenly inspires the thought. [Runs into the temple. SCENE VIII. Enter SCEPARNIO. Good heav'ns! I ne'er believ'd such pleasure was in water; I drew it with such heartiness!—The well Methought too was less deep than heretofore; With so much ease I drew it!—Verily I am an oaf, that I should fall in love now For the first time.—Here, take your water, precious! I would that you might carry it with that pleasure Which I myself do; so shall I adore you. Where are you, dainty dear?—Here, take your water.— Where are you?—Verily, I think she loves me: The wanton plays at bo-peep.—Ho! where are you?— A pleasant joke i'faith:—but come, be serious. Why won't you take it?—Where in the world are you?— I see her nowhere:—she's upon her fun.— I'll leave it on the ground.—But softly—What If some one take the pitcher?—It belongs To Venus; and 'twould bring me into trouble. 'Gad I'm afraid, the jilt has some design To trap me by its being found upon me: The magistrate would have a fair pretence To clap me into chains, if any one Should chance to see me with it: for 'tis letter'd,— Tells of itself whose property it is. I'll call the Priestess out, that she may take it. I'll to the door then of the temple. (Calling.) Ho there, Ptolemocratia!—Come, and take your pitcher.— I'll carry it in.—Troth I've enough to do, If I'm to fetch them water, all that ask for't. [Goes into the temple. SCENE IX. Enter LABRAX, followed by CHARMIDES, from among the Cliffs at the further End of the Stage. LABRAX. He that would be a beggar and a wretch, Let him trust Neptune with his life and fortune: Whoe'er has any dealings with that God, He'll send him home again in this sweet trim.— Ah, Liberty, 'twas wisely done of you, That thou would'st ne'er set foot on board a ship With Hercules.—But where's this friend of mine, Who has undone me? (Looking back.) Oh, see where he crawls. Charm. What a plague, Labrax, whither in such hurry? I can't keep up with you, you walk so fast. Labr. Would thou hadst died in Sicily on a gallows, E'er I set eyes on thee, on whose account, Ah me! this vile disaster has befall'n us. Charm. Would thou hadst lain in prison, on the day Thou first admitted me within thy doors! And I beseech the Gods, that all thy life Thou mayst for ever have such guests as I. Labr. When I let Thee in, I let in Misfortune.— Why did I hearken to thee, thou vile rogue? Why did I thence depart? why go on shipboard? Where I have lost e'en more than I was worth. Charm. I marvel not our ship was cast away, When it had such a rogue as thee on board, And thy ill-gotten pelf. Labr. Thou hast undone me With thy cajoling speeches. Charm. Thou hast giv'n me A more atrocious supper, than which erst Was set before or Tereus or Thyestes. Labr. I die! I'm sick at heart! pray, hold my head. Charm. Would thou couldst bring thy lungs up, for my part. Labr. Alas! poor Ampelisca, and Palæstra, Where are you? Charm. Food for fishes, I suppose; Gone to the bottom. Labr. Thou hast brought upon me Beggary and want, because I gave an ear To thy romancings. Charm. Nay, thou ow'st me thanks: Before, thou wast a dull insipid fellow; I've giv'n thee salt and seasoning to thy wit. Labr. Go, get thee hence, and hang thyself. Charm. Go thou.— I did as bad, when I embark'd with thee. Labr. Can there exist a wretch like me? Charm. Yes, I, I am more wretched. Labr. How? Charm. Because I don't Deserve it, but thou dost. Labr. Ye bulrushes! I envy your condition, who preserve For evermore your dryness. Charm. By my troth My words come from me broken, and as 'twere By fits, like lightning, flash succeeding flash, I tremble so. Labr. Neptune, thy bath's a cold one: Since I've come out on't in my cloaths, I freeze. He deals in nothing warm to chear our hearts, But gives up only salt and cold potations. Charm. How happy are the blacksmiths, who are ever Employ'd about a fire, are always warm! Labr. O for the nature of a duck, that now I might be dry, tho'come from out the water. Charm. What if I hire me for a bug-bear? Labr. Why? Charm. Because I chatter with my teeth so terribly. Yes, yes, I own I have deserv'd this ducking. Labr. Why so? Charm. Because I dar'd embark with Thee, Whose crimes have stir'd up ocean from its bottom. Labr. Fool! to have listen'd to thy vain pretences, That in thy country I from girls should draw Huge profit, and amass a world of riches! Charm. Why, thou unclean, unhallow'd beast, didst think To gobble up all Sicily at a mouthful? Labr. I wonder what sea-beast has gobbled up My wallet, with the treasure pack'd within it. Charm. The same, I fancy, that has got my pouch, With all its silver, which was in the wallet. Labr. Alas! I am reduc'd to this one waistcoat, And this poor shabby cloak.—Undone for ever! Charm. We may set up in partnership together; Our means are equal. Labr. Were the damsels sav'd, Some hope were left me.—Now, if Pleusidippus, Who gave me earnest for Palæstra, see me, 'Twill cause me much vexation. (He cries. Charm. Prithee, oaf, Why dost thou blubber thus?—Thou'lt never want, While thou canst wag a tongue; thy perjury Will quit all payments. SCENE X. Enter SCEPARNIO, from the Temple. What can be the matter, That these two damsels here in Venus' Temple Should so bewail them, and embrace her image? They have I know not what strange fears:—they talk Of having been last night tost on the sea, And cast on shore this morning. Labr. (overhearing) Prithee, youth, Where are the damsels, whom you mention? Scep. Here In Venus' Temple. Labr. And how many are they? Scep. As many as you and I make, put together. Labr. Undoubtedly they're mine. Scep. Undoubtedly I know not that. Labr. Of what appearance are they? Scep. Good likely wenches.—Were I in my cups, I could make shift to toy with either of them. Labr. And young forsooth? Scep. Forsooth you're plaguy troublesome. Go, if you will, and see. Labr. Dear Charmides, Sure they must be my wenches. Charm. Jove confound thee, Whether they are or not. Labr. I'll go directly Into the Temple. Charm. Go into a dungeon, I care not. [Exit Labrax. SCENE XI. CHARMIDES and SCEPARNIO. Charm. Prithee now shew me some place, Where I may sleep, good friend. Scep. Sleep where you will; There's no one hinders; the highway is common. Charm. D'ye see? my cloaths here are wet thro'; then take me Into thy house, lend me some fresh apparel, While mine is drying; thou shalt have my thanks. Scep. Here, you may take this coarse frock, if you will, It's all that I have dry: it serves to shelter me In rainy weather. Come, give me your cloaths; I'll get them dry'd. Charm. So! is it not enough The sea has made a broken merchant of me, But thou wouldst take me in too on the land? Scep. Broken or whole, I value not a straw: I shall not trust a rag without a pawn. Whether you sweat or freeze, are sick or well, I will not let a stranger in the house: No, no, I've had enough of rogues already. [Exit Sceparnio. SCENE XII. CHARMIDES alone. What! is he gone?—Why sure this fellow deals, Whoe'er he is, in girl's flesh, he's so merciless. Wet as I am, why stand I here? 'twere best To go into the Temple, and sleep off Last night's debauch, which went against my stomach. Old Neptune drench'd us with his damn'd sea-water As though 't had been Greek wine, and so he hop'd To burst our bellies with his briny draughts. Troth, had he ply'd us but a little longer, We had been fast asleep, and now indeed He has sent us home half dead.—Well, I'll go in, And see what's doing by my pot-companion. [Goes into the Temple. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter DÆMONES. How many ways the Gods make sport of men! How strangely do they fool us in our dreams! Even in sleep they will not let us rest. As for example, I myself last night Dreamt a most strange and an unheard of dream. Methought an ape made an attempt to climb Up to a swallow's nest, nor could he take The young ones out; on which he came to me, And ask'd me for a ladder: I replied, That swallows sprang from Philomel and Progne, And charg'd him not to hurt my country folks. At this the ape grew much enrag'd, and seem'd To threaten me with vengeance, summon'd me Before a judge: at last, I know not how, Highly provok'd, I caught him by the middle, And clapt the mischievous vile beast in chains. I have in vain endeavour'd to find out The meaning of this dream.—But hark! what noise Is that I hear in the adjoining Temple? I am amaz'd, and marvel what it means. SCENE II. Enter TRACHALIO from the Temple, hastily. Help, help, Cyrenians, I implore your help, Good countrymen, friends, neighbours; lend your aid To impotent distress, and crush at once This worst of villainies: let not the power Of wicked men oppress the innocent, Who glory not in crimes: let punishment Wait on bold vice, reward on modest virtue: O let us live by law, and not oppression! Run, run into the temple: I again Implore your help, all that are near me, all That hear my cry! O haste to bring them succour, Who (as allow'd by custom) have here fled To Venus and her Priestess for protection.— Break, break the neck of this vile injury, Ere it may reach yourselves. Dæm. Now what's the matter? Trach. O good old gentleman, whoe'er you are, I do besecch you by these knees,— Dæm. Nay prithee Let go my knees, and tell me, what's the matter? What mean you by this uproar? Trach. I beseech you, As you would hope a fair and prosperous vintage, As you would make your exportations safe To Capua, as you wish to keep your eye-sight Clear and exempt from running,— Dæm. Are you mad? Trach. As you expect, I say, a plenteous crop, Be not averse to hear what I request. Dæm. And I beseech you by your legs and back, As you would hope a fair and prosperous whipping, As you expect a plenteous crop of lashes, Inform me, what's the matter? whence this uproar? Trach. Why do you speak me ill? I wish'd you good. Dæm. I do not speak you ill in wishing you What you deserve. Trach. Pray mind me. Dæm. What's the matter? Trach. Two innocent young damsels in the Temple Need your assistance: they are basely us'd 'Gainst law and justice; the poor Priestess too Is treated most unworthily. Dæm. Who dares Do violence to the priestess?—But these girls, Who are they? how are they abus'd? Trach. I'll tell you, If you'll attend.—They now embrace the statue, Which a vile rogue would drag them from by force, Though they are both born free. Dæm. What is the fellow, That pays so little reverence to the Gods? Trach. A cheat, a profligate, a parricide, A perjur'd, lawless villain: in one word, He's a Procurer: I need say no more. Dæm. You've said enough to prove he deserves hanging. Trach. A rascal!—had the insolence to take The Priestess by the throat. Dæm. And he shall pay for't. Turbalio! Sparax! ho, come forth! where are you? Trach. Pray, sir, go in, and take their part. Dæm. I warrant you. I need not call twice: they'll be here directly. [Turbalio and Sparax enter.] Come, follow me. [Goes with his servants into the Temple.] Trach. Bid them to tear his eyes out. Dæm. (within) Seize him, drag him along with his feet foremost, Like a stuck pig. Trach. (listening) I hear a rout within. They're currying him, I fancy, with their fists: I wish they'd knock his teeth out, a vile rascal! But see, here come the damsels sadly frighten'd. SCENE III. PALÆSTRA and AMPELISCA appear in the Temple Court. PALÆSTRA. Now are we destitute of ev'ry power, Of ev'ry succour and defence, no hope Of safety left us, neither do we know Which way to turn, or whither to betake us. Dire apprehensions compass us around, Such outrage have we suffer'd here within From the base rogue our master, who most rudely Push'd down the good old priestess, treated her With the most vile indignities, and drag'd us With violence from the statue.—Seeing then Our state is desperate, it were best to die. Death is the only refuge in affliction. Trach. What do I hear? what sad complaints are these? Why don't I go and comfort them?—Palæstra! Pal. Who calls there? Trach. Ampelisca! Amp. Ha! who's that? Pal. Who is it call us? Trach. Turn, and you will know. Pal. (turning) O my best hopes of safety! Trach. No more wailings: Be of good heart: have faith in me. Pal. If possible, O save and shelter us from impious violence, Lest it should force me to do violence To my own self. Trach. No more:—you are a fool. Amp. Seek not to comfort us with words alone. Pal. Except you find a real safe-guard for us, We are undone; and I'm resolv'd to die Sooner than fall into this villain's power. Yet have I but a woman's heart; for when I think on death, I tremble. Trach. Though your case Is hard, have a good heart. Pa. Where shall I find it? Trach. Don't be dismay'd, sit down here by this altar. Pal. What can this altar now avail us more Than did the statue, which we late embrac'd, 'Till drag'd from it by force? Trach. Do but sit down, I'll guard you: let this altar be your fortress, I will defend the works: with Venus' help I'll stand against th'attacks of this Procurer. Pal. We'll follow your instructions.— (The Women advance towards the Altar, and kneel.) —Gentle Venus! Thus lowly on our knees, and bath'd in tears, Embracing this your altar, we beseech you, Guard and receive us into your protection: Avenge you on those miscreants, who dare slight Your Temple, and permit us to approach Your altar, who last night by Neptune's power Were cast away: O hold us not in scorn, Nor think it done amiss, that thus we come Less seemingly accoutred than we ought. Trach. They ask but what is right, and you should grant it: You must forgive them: their sad apprehensions Force them to what they do. Yourself, they say, Sprung from the ocean, slight not then these outcasts. But the old gentleman, our common friend, Comes opportunely here from out the Temple. SCENE IV. Enter DÆMONES, dragging LABRAX. Come forth, thou worst of sacrilegious villains. (To the women) You, seat you by the altar there.—Where are they? Where are my slaves? Trach. Look, here they are. Dæm. That's well. A Servant. We'd fain be at him: bid him but come near. Dæm. (To Labrax, who is going towards the Altar.) How, rascal! wou'd you sacrifice with us? (To the Servants) Lay your fists on him. (They beat him.) Lab. I must bear your wrongs, But you shall pay for't. Dæm. Does he dare to threaten? Lab. You rob me of my right; you take away My girls in spite of me. Trach. Make your appeal To any of the great ones of the senate; And let him try the cause, whether they're your's, Or else born free; and whether too your knaveship Should not be clapt in prison, there to lye Till you have worn it out. Lab. I have no business To talk with this hang-gallows slave.— (speaking to Dæmones.) 'Tis you, That I must try the cause with. Dæm. First of all Try it with him, who is no stranger to you. Lab. My suit's with you. Trach. Your suit must be with me. Are these your property? Lab. They are. Trach. Come on then, Do but touch either with your little finger. Lab. What if I do? Trach. I'll make a foot-ball of you, Swing you about in air, and with my fists Bandy you to and fro, you perjur'd villain! Lab. May I not take my own girls from the altar? Dæm. You may not; that's our law. Lab. I've no concern, Nothing to do, no business with your laws: I'll take them both away.—Lookye, old gentleman, If you've a liking to them, you must down With the hard money. Dæm. Venus does approve them. Lab. And she may have them, if she'll pay the money. Dæm. I'll pay the money! Now then know my mind: If you dare offer them the smallest violence, Though but in jest, I'll give you such a dressing, You will not know yourself.— (To his Servants) And you, ye rascals, If, when I give the signal, you don't tear His eyes out of his head, I'll have you bound With rods lash'd round you; like those sprigs of myrtle. Lab. Nay, this is violence. Trach. You burning shame! What, do you talk of violence? Lab. You knave, You gallows rogue, how dare you to abuse me? Trach. Well, let me be a rogue, and you forsooth A man of strictest honesty,—these girls, Are they a whit less free? Lab. Free, say you? Trach. Yes, And are your mistresses; both born in Greece; One an Athenian, sprung from gentle parents. Dæm. What do I hear you say? Trach. That she is free; Was born at Athens. Dæm. How! my countrywoman? Trach. What! are not you, Sir, a Cyrenian? Dæm. No: In Greece, at Athens, I was born and bred. Trach. I pray you then, defend your countrywomen. Dæm. (Aside) O my dear daughter!—when I look on Her, The want of you reminds me of my troubles.— I lost her when but three years old, and now, If she yet live, her size must be the same. Labr. I bought them both, paid down the money for them To him, that own'd them.—What is it to me, If they were born at Athens or at Thebes, So they are properly my slaves? Trach. Thou impudence, Thou cat o'mountain, thou vile girl-catcher, Would'st kidnap free-born children from their parents, And then employ them in thy filthy trade?— This other here, what country she is of I know not, but I know she's worthier Than you, you filthy knave! Labr. Do you say true? Trach. Nay, let our backs be vouchers for our truth, And if you have not offerings on your back More than a first-rate ship has nails, I'm then The veriest lyar upon earth. When your's I have inspected, look at mine; you'll find it Tight and without a crack in't, that there's never A leathern-bottle-maker but will say, My hide is whole, and fitting for his purpose. Why don't I give the rogue his belly-full Of stripes?—Why stare so at them?—If you touch them, I'll tear your eyes out. Labr. Now, because you'd hinder me, I'll take them both away. Dæm. What will you do? Labr. Fetch Vulcan; he's an enemy to Venus. (Goes towards Dæmones's door.) Dæm. Where is he going? Labr. (Calling at Dæmones's door) Hola! who's within here? Dæm. If you but touch the threshold of that door, A plenteous crop of blows shall be your portion. A Servant. We have no fire; we live upon dried figs. Dæm. I'll give you fire, provided I may kindle it Upon your head. Labr. Faith, I'll procure it somewhere. Dæm. What will you do then? Labr. Kindle a large fire. Dæm. To burn yourself. Labr. To burn them both alive Here at the altar. Dæm. I would fain see that.— By heav'ns I'll catch you by the beard, and throw you Into the fire, then hang you up half-roasted For birds to peck at.—(Aside) Now I think on't, this Must be the ape I dreamt of, who would needs Have taken these young swallows from their nests Spite of my teeth. Trach. I do beseech you, Sir, Defend these maidens, while I fetch my master. Dæm. Go then. Trach. And let him not— Dæm. 'Tis at his peril, If he dare touch them once, or e'en attempt it. Trach. You will take care. Dæm. I will take care.—Be gone. Trach. And guard Him too; see that he don't get off: For we have promis'd to deliver him Up to the hangman's hands, or pay a talent. [Exit Trachalio. SCENE V. DÆMONES, LABRAX, PALÆSTRA, AMPELISCA, and SERVANTS. DÆMONES, (to LABRAX.) Which do you chuse? to stay here quietly Without a drubbing, or be forc'd to't with one? Labr. Your words I value not a fig, old gentleman. I'll drag them from the altar by the hair In spite of You, of Venus, or of Jove. Dæm. Do, touch them. Labr. (Going towards them.) That I will, by heav'ns. Dæm. Come on then. Do but step hither. Labr. Bid those fellows then Move off. Dæm. Nay, nay, they shall move up towards you. Labr. I would not have them. Dæm. Why? What will you do, If they advance still nearer? Labr. I'll retire. But hearkye me, old grey-beard;—if I ever Should chance to light upon you in the city, Let me foreswear the name of pimp for aye, But I will make most precious sport with you. Dæm. Do what you menace when you please: mean time If now you touch them, you shall pay for't hugely. Labr. How! hugely? Dæm. Aye, as such a pimp deserves. Labr. I value not your threats, but I will seize them Spite of your teeth. Dæm. Do, touch them, if you dare. Labr. Faith, that I will. Dæm. Do then, you know the consequence. Turbalio, run with all your speed, and bring Two cudgels. Labr. Cudgels? Dæm. Stout ones let them be: Make haste. [Turbalio goes in.] (To Labrax) I'll give you a reception, such As you deserve, you rascal! Labr. (Aside) Woe is me! That I have left my head-piece in the ship! Now, if I had it, it would be of service.— (To Dæm.) May I not speak to them at least? Dæm. You may not. [Turbalio enters, bearing two cudgels.] Oh, here he comes, the fellow with his cudgels. Lab. These are design'd for musick, and they cause A most melodious tinkling in the ears. Dæm. Here, Labrax, do you take that other cudgel: One of you stand on this side, and the other On that side of the altar.—Mind me now.— If he but lay a finger on these girls Against their inclination, woe be to you, If you don't briskly ply him with your cudgels, 'Till, like a drunkard, he shall scarce be able To find his way home.—If he speaks to any one, You answer in their stead; and if he offers To run away, strait hamper him, by making Your cudgels serve as fetters for his legs. Lab. What! won't they let me go about my business? Dæm. I've said enough.—When that the servant comes, Who went to fetch his master, then go home.— See that you carefully observe my orders. [Exit Dæ mones. SCENE VI. LABRAX, and SERVANTS. The two Women, as before. LABRAX, walking on one Side. Hey-day! the Temple's on a sudden chang'd From Venus's to that of Hercules: For the old gentleman has planted here Two figures with their clubs.—Now for my life I know not where to take me;—sea and land Are both conspir'd against me.—O Palæstra! Serv. What would you? Lab. Hold! we're at cross purposes: This is not My Palæstra, that has answer'd. Ho Ampelisca! Serv. 'Ware thee of mishap. Lab. These fellows give me good advice, however. But tell me, ho! will there be any harm, If I come nearer them? Serv. No harm to us. Lab. Will there be any harm to me? Serv. No, none, If you beware. Lab. Of what must I beware? Serv. An hearty drubbing. Lab. I beseech you now, Permit me to depart. Serv. Go, If you will. Lab. Very obliging this: I give you thanks: No, I'll draw nearer rather to my girls. Serv. Stay where you are. Lab. 'Fore heaven my affairs Are in a piteous plight.—But I'm resolv'd To lay close siege, and force them to surrender. SCENE VII. Enter PLEUSIDIPPUS and TRACHALIO, talking, at a Distance. What! would the rascal drag her off perforce, By violence from the altar? Trach. Even so. Pleu. Did you not kill the villain on the spot? Trach. There was no sword at hand. Pleu. You should have taken A club or stone. Trach. Shou'd I have ston'd the fellow? Have ston'd him like a dog? Pleu. Yes, such a villain. Lab. (seeing them) Now I'm undone indeed.—Here's Pleusidippus: He'll brush my jacket for me;—aye, he'll give me A thorough dusting. Pleu. Were the damsels sitting Then by the altar, when you went for me? Trach. Yes, and are sitting now there. Pleu. Who protects them? Trach. A good old gentleman, I know not who, Who lives close by the temple: he has been Of special use, and of most rare assistance. He and his servants now protect and guard them: I gave them to their charge. Pleu. Conduct me strait To the Procurer: shew me, where's the villain? [They advance.] Lab. (to Pleus.) Good morrow. Pleu. Hang good-morrow: take your choice This instant, whether you'd be carried gently Before a judge, or drag'd there by the throat. Chuse which you will, while 'tis allow'd you. Labr. Neither. Pleu. Trachalio, run with speed to the sea-side, And bid the friends I brought along with me To meet me forthwith at the city-gate, That they may help to drag this knave to prison: That done, come back again, and guard these damsels. [Exit Trachalio. SCENE VIII. PLEUSIDIPPUS, LABRAX, SERVANTS, and the WOMEN as before. PLEUSIDIPPUS. Yes, I will bear this rascal run-away Before a judge.—Come, come before the judge. Lab. What is my crime? Pleu. Crime, ask you?—Did you not Take earnest of me for this damsel here, Then bore her off? Lab. I did not bear her off. Pleu. Will you deny it? Lab. Yes, because I only Bore her on board; I could not bear her off, The more is my mishap.—Did I not say, That you should find me here at Venus' temple? Wherein then have I falsified my word? Am I not here? Pleu. Nay, you shall plead your cause Before the magistrate: I'll hear no more.— Come, come along. (Lays hold of him.) Lab. (calling) Help! help!—Dear Charmides! I am laid hold of, drag'd here by the throat. SCENE IX. Enter CHARMIDES from the Temple. Who calls me by my name? Lab. Dost thou not see How I am drag'd? Charm. I see it, and look on With pleasure. Lab. Wilt not come to my assistance? Charm. Who has got hold of thee? Lab. Young Pleusidippus. Charm. Bear thy mishap with patience: thou hadst better Slink quietly to jail: why thou hast got What most men wish for. Lab. What is that? Charm. To find What they are seeking. Lab. Prithee bear me company. Charm. Troth thy request is like thee: thou art drag'd To jail, and thou would'st have me bear thee company. What! hanging back? Lab. O I'm undone for ever! Pleu. Would it were true!—Do you, my dear Palæstra, And Ampelisca, tarry here the while Till my return. Serv. I would advise them rather To go to our house, and there wait your coming. Pleu. I like it: you oblige me. Lab. Ye are thieves, Serv. How! thieves? Pleu. Drag him along. Lab. Help! help! Palæstra! Pleu. On, rascal! Lab. Guest! Charm. No guest of thine: I scorn To be thy mess-mate. Lab. Wilt thou slight me thus? Charm. I do: I've tasted of thy cheer already. Lab. Plague light upon thy head! Charm. On thine, say rather. [Pleusidippus drags Charmides off. The Women and Servants go into Dæmones's House. SCENE X. CHARMIDES alone. I do believe, that men are metamorphos'd Some into one brute, some into another. This rascal pimp here on my faith I think Is chang'd into a stock-dove, for ere long They'll have him in the stocks, and in the cage For jail-birds like himself, he'll make his nest. However I will go, and be his advocate, If by my help he may be sooner cast. [Exit. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter DÆMONES. 'Twas a right deed, and 'tis a pleasure to me, That I could serve these damsels.—I am now Their patron and protector. They are both Of a rare age and beauty; but the jade, My wife, still watches me on ev'ry side, Lest I should shew a liking to the damsels.— I marvel what my slave Gripus is doing, Who went last night a fishing on the sea: He had been wiser, had he slept at home, Such weather, such a night: what he has caught, I'll dress within the hollow of my hand, The sea was so tempestuous. (He is called) But my wife Calls me to dinner; I must home again; Though she will stun my ears with her vile prattle. SCENE II. Enter GRIPUS.) Thanks to my patron Neptune, whose abode Is in the briny regions stor'd with fishes, Since he has sent me from his watry realms Full fraught, and laden with the choicest booty; My boat too safe, which in the stormy sea Has blest me with a new and plenteous fishing. 'Twas a rare chance this kind of fishery, How very wondrous and incredible! I have not caught me an ounce weight of fish, Save what I have here in my net. I rose. At midnight all alert, prefering gain To rest and sleep; and though the tempest roar'd, I labour'd to relieve my master's wants, And help me in my state of servitude. I never have been sparing of my pains. The sluggard's good for nothing: I detest Such kind of fellows. He, who in good time Would do his duty, should be vigilant, Not wait, 'till he is rous'd to't by his master. Those who love sleep, indulge it to their cost; They get no profit, and are sure to suffer. I, who was ever diligent, have found That which will keep me lazy, if I will. I found it in the sea, whatever's in it. Whatever's in it, by my faith 'tis heavy: I think there's gold in't. Not a soul besides Is privy to the chance. Now, Gripus, now Thou hast a fair occasion to procure Thy freedom of the Prætor. This I'll do, This I'm determin'd, I'll address my master With art and cunning, proffer him a sum By little and by little for my freedom: When I am free, I'll purchase house and lands, And slaves, and fit out vessels, and engage In traffick; among kings I'll be a king. And then for my amusement I will build A pleasure-barge, and copy Stratonicus: I'll sail about from place to place: and when My greatness is notorious, I will found A mighty city, and will call it Gripus After my own name, as a monument Of my exploits and fame: there I'll erect A potent monarchy.—My mind's resolv'd On high and mighty matters.—But 'twere best To hide this wallet; and this king must dine On salt and vinegar, no better chear. (Going) SCENE III. Enter TRACHALIO. Ho! stay there— Grip. Stay! for what? Trach. Till I roll up This rope here, which you're dragging after you. Grip. Let it alone pray. Trach. But I must assist you. Kindness on good men is not thrown away. Grip. The weather yesterday was very boisterous: I have no fish, young man; don't think I have. And don't you see, I bring my net home wet, With nothing in't? Trach. It is not fish I want, But only to discourse with you. Grip. You kill me (Going) With your impertinence, whoe'er you are. Trach. (Holding him.) I will not let you go.—Stay. Grip. See that you Repent not.—What a plague d'ye pull me back for? Trach. Hear me. Grip. I will not hear. Trach. Nay but you shall. Grip. Another time say what you will. Trach. But good now, What I've to tell you is of moment. Grip. Speak, What is it? Trach. See, if no one is behind us. Grip. And how am I concern'd in't? Trach. Very much. But can you give me good advice? Grip. What is it? Tell me. Trach. I'll tell you,—hist,—If you will promise Not to betray me. Grip. Well then, I do promise Not to betray you, whosoe'er you are. Trach. List then. I saw a man commit a theft, And knew the owner, whom the goods belong'd to. Strait comes I to the thief, and offers him This fair proposal. Of your theft, quoth I, I'm witness, and I know the owner: now If you will give me half, I'll not discover it. The fellow makes me no reply. What think you It were but just that he should give me? Half, I hope you'll say. Grip. Ay truly that, and more: If he don't give it, you shou'd tell the owner. Trach. I'll do as you advise me.—Mind me now: For this is your concern. Grip. How my concern? Trach. That wallet; I have known the owner long. Grip. What's that? Trach. And how 'twas lost. Grip. And how 'twas found I know, and who 'twas found it, and I know Who is the owner now: but what is that To you or me? I know whose it is now, You whose it was. No one shall have it from me: Think not to get it. Trach. If the owner comes, Shall he not have it? Grip. No one is the owner,— Don't be mistaken,—no one but myself, Who caught it when a fishing. Trach. Did you so? Grip. What fish is in the sea, that is not mine? As soon as I have caught them, they are mine; I hold them for my own, at my disposal; And no one claims a part: I sell them all As my own property in open market. The sea is common unto all. Trach. Agreed: This wallet then, why shou'd it not be common 'Twixt you and me? you found it in the sea; 'Tis common then. Grip. Was ever such assurance? If this were law you talk of, we poor fishermen Would be undone; for soon as e'er our fish Were brought to market, and exposed to sale, No one would buy, but ev'ry one would claim A portion of the fish, crying forsooth, That we had caught them in the sea that's common. Trach. How say you, sauce-box? Will you dare to place A wallet in comparison with fish? Think you, they are the same? Grip. When I have thrown My net in, 'tis no longer in my power: Whatever sticks to it. I haul it up, And what my net has got, is mine alone. Trach. Nay but it is not, if you catch a wallet. Grip. O rare philosopher! Trach. Good conjurer, Did you e'er know a fisherman, that caught A wallet fish, or carried one to market? Would you be jack of all trades as you like? Would you, you rascal, deal in wallets too As well as be a fisherman? But now Shew me what kind of fish a wallet is, Or you shall carry nothing off, that was not Bred in the sea, and has not scales. Grip. What never Heard of a wallet-fish before? Trach. You villain! There's no such fish. Grip. Nay verily there is; And I, who am a fisherman, must know: But it is rarely caught: no fish so seldom Comes to our coast. Trach. That will avail you nought, You gallows knave; d'ye think you can deceive me? What colour is it of? Grip. There are but few Caught of this colour: some are red, some black, And some are very large. Trach. I understand you. You will be chang'd into a wallet fish, Unless you have a care: first you'll be red, Then black. Grip. What rascal have I stumbled on? Trach. This is mere talking, and we waste the day. Whose arbitration, say, shall we abide by? Grip. That wallet's. Trach. Ay indeed!—You are a fool. Grip. Fare you well, Thales! (Going) Trach. (Holding him) Nay you shall not have it, Unless you place it in some person's hands, And chuse an umpire to decide betwixt us. Grip. What, are you mad? Trach. I'm drunk with ellebore. Grip. I'm Ceres-struck: yet I'll not part with this. Trach. Speak but another word, I'll knock your brains out; If you don't let it go, like a new spunge, I'll suck up ev'ry drop of moisture in you. Grip. Touch me, and I will dash you to the ground Flat as a flounder.—Will you fight? Trach. What need Of fighting? rather let us share the booty. Grip. You will get nothing but your own mishap, So don't expect it. I'll be gone. (Going.) Trach. But I Will make your vessel tack about to stop you. Grip. If you are at the poop, I'll keep at stern. Let go the rope, you rascal. Trach. Let it go? Do you let go the wallet. Grip. You'll not be A fig the better now for all that's in it. Trach. Your bare denial is no proof to me, But you must either let me have a share on't, Or you must place it in some person's hands, And chuse an umpire to decide betwixt us. Grip. How! what I caught at sea?— Trach. I saw from shore. Grip. With my own pains, my own net, my own boat? Trach. What if the owner come, whose property It is, shall I, who saw you from a far Take it, be counted less a thief than you? Grip. No, certainly. (Offers to go.) Trach. Stay, rascal. By what argument Am I to be a thief, and not a sharer? Give me to know. Grip. I can't, nor do I know Your city laws; but this is mine, I'll stand to it. Trach. I say tis mine too. Grip. Hold—I've found a method, How you may neither be the thief nor sharer. Trach. Ah! how is that? Grip. Let me depart in peace, Do you go your own way, and hold your tongue: You shall tell no one, and I'll give you nothing: You shall be silent, I'll be silent too. This is the best, the fairest thing that can be. Trach. What! will you make me no proposal? Grip. Yes; I have already.—“That you should be gone, “Let go the rope, and trouble me no longer.” Trach. Stay; will you take my offer? Grip. Prithee take Yourself away. Trach. Do you know any one Lives hereabouts? Grip. Sure I must know my neighbours. Trach. Where do you live? Grip. Far off in yonder fields. Trach. Say, will you leave it to his arbitration, Who lives here at this house? (Pointing to Dæmones's house.) Grip. Let go the rope A little, while I step apart, and think on't.— (Aside) Bravo! all's safe: the prize is all my own. My fellow summons me on my own dunghill, Chuses my master for an arbitrator! I dare be sworn, he will not give a doit Away from his own servant. Sure the fool Is not aware of what he has proposed.— (To Trach.) Well, I'll attend you to the arbitrator. Trach. What should you do else? Grip. Though I know for certain This is my lawful right, I'll do so rather Than go to boxing with you. Trach. Now you please me. Grip. Though I am call'd before an arbitrator, Who is a stranger, and unknown to me, If he but do me justice, though unknown, It is the same as though we were acquainted. If not, though known, he's as an utter stranger. (They advance towards as Dæmones's House.) SCENE IV. Enter DÆMONES, with PALÆSTRA and AMPELISCA; the two SERVANTS behind. DÆMONES. Faith seriously, my girls, I wish to do What you yourselves wish, but I fear, my wife On your account would thrust me out of doors, Pretending that I brought my misses home Under her nose, before her eyes.—Do you then, Rather than I, take refuge at the altar. Pal. and Amp. We are undone! Dæm. Fear nothing: I'll protect you. (To the Servants.) What brought you out of doors? Why do you follow me? While I am present, no one shall molest them. Go get ye in, I say, and there stand centinel. Grip. Save you, good master. Dæm. How now, Gripus? Save you. Trach. Is this your servant? Grip. Yes, and no disgrace to him Trach. I've nothing to do with you. Grip. Get you gone then. Trach. I pray you, tell me, Sir; is this your servant? Dæm. He is. Trach. So,—best of all then, if he is. Once more I kiss your hands, Sir. Dæm. I am your's. You are the fellow, are you not, that went A little while ago to call your master? Trach. The same. Dæm. What would you now? Trach. Is this your servant? Dæm. He is. Trach. So,—best of all then, if he is. Dæm. What is the matter? Trach. He's an arrant rascal. Dæm. What has this arrant rascal done to you? Trach. I would his legs were broke. Dæm. Why, what's the matter? What is your contest now about? Trach. I'll tell you. Grip. Nay I will tell you. Trach. I will; 'tis my business To move the court. Grip. If you had any shame, You would move off. Dæm. Peace, Gripus, and attend. Grip. What! shall he speak the first? Dæm. Attend, I say. (To Trach.) Speak you. Grip. And will you let a stranger speak 'Fore your own servant? Trach. How impossible To curb his tongue!—As I was telling you, That curst Procurer's wallet, whom you drove Just now from Venus' Temple,—lo! he has it. Grip. I have it not. Trach. And will you dare deny What I beheld myself, with my own eyes? Grip. Would you were blind, I say!—Suppose I have it, Or have it not, why d'ye concern yourself With my affairs? Trach. It does concern me, whether You have possession justly or unjustly. Grip. I caught it, or I'd give you leave to hang me. Since in the sea I caught it with my net, How is't more your's than mine? Trach. He wou'd deceive you: He has it, as I told you. Grip. What d'ye say? Trach. If he's your servant, prithee keep him under, That I, whose right it is, may speak the first. Grip. How! would you have my master deal with me, As your's with you? though he may keep you under, Our master is not us'd to serve us so. Dæm. Faith he has match'd you there.—What wou'd you? tell me. Trach. I ask no share, no portion of the wallet, Nor did I say 'twas mine: but there is in it A little casket of that damsel's, who I told you was free-born. Dæm. What her you mean, My countrywoman, as you said? Trach. The same. And in that casket, which is in the wallet, There are some toys of her's, which when a child She had: to him they're of no use or service, But if he give them her, may be the means For her to find her parents. Dæm. Say no more, I'll make him give them. Grip. Troth I'll give her nothing. Trach. I ask but for the casket and those toys. Grip. But what if they be gold? Trach. Suppose they are, You shall have gold for gold, of equal value, Silver for silver. Grip. Let me see your gold, And you shall see the casket. Dæm. Hold your tongue; Beware thee of a drubbing:—(To Trach.) You go on. Trach. I pray you, have compassion of this damsel, If it indeed be the Procurer's wallet, As I suppose it is; I do not say 'Tis his for certain, but 'tis my opinion. Grip. (Aside) See how the rascal tries to catch his favour! Trach. Let me proceed.—If 'tis the rascal's wallet, These girls will surely know it:—order him To shew it them. Grip. How! shew it them? Dæm. He asks Nothing but what is reasonable, Gripus. Grip. 'Tis most unreasonable. Dæm. Why? Grip. Because, If I produce it, they will cry at once They know it truly. Trach. Rascal! do you think That ev'ry body's like yourself?—false varlet! Grip. I bear all this with patience, while my master Is on my side. Trach. But now he is against you, And that the casket will bear testimony. Dæm. Gripus, be silent and attend! (To Trach.) Do you Tell me in few, what is it you would have? Trach. I've told you, and I'll tell it you again, If yet sufficiently you understand not. These damsels, I inform'd you, are free-born; And one was stol'n from Athens when a child. Grip. But what is this pray to the wallet, whether They're slaves or free? Trach. You'd have me spend the day In telling the whole o'er again, you villain! Dæm. Spare your abuses, and inform me clearly In what I ask. Trach. There should be in the wallet A wicker casket, that contains some tokens, Which the poor girl may find her parents by, And which she had, when stol'n a little child From Athens, as I told you. Grip. Jupiter, And all the Gods confound you! Don't you see The damsels are both dumb? why cannot they Speak for themselves? Trach. Because it more becomes A woman to be silent than to talk. Grip. Then by your talk you're neither man nor woman. Trach. Why? Grip. Talk or not talk, you are good for nothing. (To Dæm.) Pray, may I never be allow'd to speak? Dæm. Speak but another word, I'll break your head. Trach. Pray, Sir, command him to deliver up That casket to the girls, and what reward He asks for finding it, it shall be given: What else is in the wallet, let him have. Grip. Ah, so you say at last, now you're convinc'd I have a right to't, though e'en now you wanted To go snacks with me. Trach. And I want it still. Grip. So have I seen a kite stoop at his prey, And yet get nothing. Dæm. Can't I stop your mouth Without a drubbing? Grip. If he's silent, I'll Be silent too; but if he speak, let me too Speak in my turn. Dæm. Give me the wallet, Gripus. Grip. I'll trust it to you on condition you'll Return it, if there's nothing in't of theirs. Dæm. I will. Grip. There—take it. (Giving him the wallet.) Dæm. Hearkye me, Palæstra, And Ampelisca, attend to what I say.— Is this the wallet, that contains your casket? Pal. The same. Grip. So,—I'm undone, I find.—Before She could well see it, she cries out—“The same.” Pal. I'll make this matter plain, and clear up all. There is a wicker casket in that wallet; And each particular that it contains I'll reckon one by one: you shall not shew me: If wrong, my word will serve me in no stead, And all that's in the casket shall be your's; If right, I pray you let me have my own. Dæm. Agreed: she only asks for common justice, In my opinion. Trach. And in mine. Grip. But what If she's a witch, and by that means should tell What's in the casket? shall a witch then carry it? Dæm. No, not unless she give a just account; Her witchcraft shall not serve her.—Open then The wallet; I wou'd know the truth directly. Grip. (Opening it) The deed is done!—'tis open'd.—Ah! I'm ruin'd! I see a casket. Dæm. Is this it? Pal. The same. In this, my parents, are you lock'd; in this My hopes of finding you, and means are lodg'd. Grip. Verily you deserve the Gods displeasure, To cram your parents in so close a compass. Dæm. Come hither, Gripus:—'tis your cause is trying. (To Pal.) Hearkye me, girl; at distance where you are Tell the contents, and give a just description Of each particular within the casket. If in the smallest tittle you mistake, Though afterwards you'd wish to speak the truth, I'd hold it nothing but egregious trifling. Grip. You talk what's fair, and justice. Trach. Then of you He talks not: you and justice are quite opposite. Dæm. Speak, girl.—Gripus, give ear, and hold your tongue. Pal. There are some toys. Dæm. I see them. Grip. I am slain At the first onset.—Hold, Sir,—don't produce them. Dæm. Describe them,—and recount them all in order. Pal. First, there's a little sword with an inscription. Dæm. What's the inscription? Pal. 'Tis my father's name. Then, there's a little two edg'd axe, of gold too, Bearing th'inscription of my mother's name. Dæm. Hold,—what's your father's name upon the sword? Pal. 'Tis—Dæmones. Dæm. O ye immortal Gods! Where are my hopes? Grip. Nay truly, where are mine? Dæm. Proceed, I do beseech you, quickly. Grip. Gently.— (Aside.) Wou'd you were hang'd! Dæm. Tell me your mother's name Upon the axe. Pal. 'Tis—Dædalis. Dæm. The Gods Are anxious for my welfare. Grip. And my ruin. Dæm. Why, Gripus, she must surely be my daughter. Grip. She may be so for me.—(To Trach.) May all the Gods Confound you, that you chanc'd to spy me out; And me too, that I did not look about me An hundred times to watch if no one saw me, Before I drew my net out of the water. Pal. Then there's a small too-handed silver knife, A little sow too. Grip. Would that you were hang'd, You and your sow too, pigs and all together! Pal. There is besides a little heart of gold, Given me by my father on my birth-day. Dæm. 'Tis she, 'tis she!—I can refrain no longer, I must embrace her. (They embrace.) Save you, my dear daughter! I, I am Dæmones, and Dædalis Your mother is within here. Pal. Blessings on you, My unexpected, my unhop'd-for father! Dæm. Heav'ns bless you!—With what joy do I embrace you! Trach. To me too 'tis a pleasure, since your piety Has wrought this happy chance. Dæm. Come, take the wallet, And bear it in, Trachalio, if you can. Trach. (Taking the wallet.) Behold the roguery of Gripus!—Gripus, I give you joy upon your ill success. Dæm. Come, daughter, let us in now to your mother. For she can question you of further proofs, Who has been more accustom'd to you, more Acquainted with your tokens. Trach. We'll all in, Since we are all concern'd in this event. Pal. Follow me, Ampelisca. Amp. I'm rejoic'd To find the Gods so favourable to you. [Exeunt all but Gripus. SCENE V. GRIPUS alone. Well—what an ass am I, t'have found this wallet, And not have hid it in some secret place! I thought that I should have a plaguy job on't, Because I found it in such plaguy weather. Troth I believe there is a deal of gold And silver in it. I had best go home, And hang myself in private,—for a while At least, till I am rid of this vexation. [Exit. SCENE VI. Enter DÆMONES. Good heav'ns! was ever man more blest than I, So unexpectedly to find my daughter! Is it not plain, that when the Gods would shew Favour to men, they shew it to the virtuous? Thus I, beyond my hope, beyond belief, Most unexpectedly have found my daughter: And I'll bestow her on a noble youth, My kinsman, an Athenian. I would have him Fetch'd here directly; and I bade his servant Come forth, that I might send him to the Forum. I marvel why he is not come.—'Twere best Go to the door.—(He looks in.) What do I see?—My wife Hugging and hanging on her daughter's neck.— This fondling is absurd, 'tis all too idle. (Calling at the door.) Nay prithee, wife, a truce with your caresses; See all things ready for the sacrifice, Which we must offer to our houshold Gods, Who have increas'd our family.—We have lambs And hogs nurtur'd for sacred use.—But why Do ye detain Trachalio?—Oh, he comes. SCENE VII. Enter TRACHALIO. Trust me, I'll find him out, where'er he is, And bring him with me. Dæm. Tell him what has happen'd Concerning of my daughter, and beseech him To leave all other matters, and come hither. Trach. Well. Dæm. Tell him he shall have my daughter. Trach. Well. Dæm. And that I knew his father, and that he Is my relation. Trach. Well. Dæm. But make haste. Trach. Well. Dæm. Besure you bring him here to supper. Trach. Well. Dæm. How! Well to every thing? Trach. Well.—But d'ye know I've a request to make?—that you'd remember What you have promis'd,—to procure my freedom. Dæm. Well. Trach. Then persuade my master Pleusidippus To give it me. Dæm. Well. Trach. Let your daughter join In the request: she'll easily prevail. Dæm. Well. Trach. Further, let me marry Ampelisca, When I've my freedom. Dæm. Well. Trach. And let me find My services indeed rewarded. Dæm. Well. Trach. How! Well to ev'ry thing? Dæm. Well.—So, methinks I'm even with you.—Prithee now run quickly Into the city, and come back with speed. Trach. Well.—I'll be here this instant.—In the interim Get all things ready for the sacrifice. Dæm. Well. [Exit Trachalio. —Ill betide him with his Wells, say I! He has so stuff'd my ears with nothing else, Let me say what I wou'd, but Well, Well, Well. SCENE VIII. Enter GRIPUS. When may I have a word with you, good master? Dæm. The matter, Gripus? Grip. Touching this same wallet: If you are wise, be wise: keep what the Gods Have graciously bestow'd. Dæm. D'ye think it just, That I should claim for mine what is another's? Grip. And why not, when I found it in the sea? Dæm. So much the better luck for him, who lost it: But that don't make it your's a whit the more. Grip. 'Tis by your over-righteousness you're poor. Dæm. O Gripus, Gripus, there are many traps Laid to ensnare mankind; and whosoever Snaps at the bait, is caught by his own greediness: But he, who acts with caution and with care, May long enjoy what honestly he owns. We shall get more by parting with this booty Than we were better'd by its acquisition.— What! when I know another's property Is fall'n into my hands, shall I conceal it?— No, Dæmones will never do't.—The wise Can never be too cautious in this point, Lest they become partakers of ill deeds With their own servants. 'Tis enough for me The pleasure of the game, and I'm indifferent About the winning. Grip. So I've often heard The players talking in the same wise manner, And much applauded, while they pointed out Sound morals to the people; but when each man Went his way home, not one of all the audience Became such as they bade him be. Dæm. Go in; Don't be impertinent, but cease your chattering. I'll give you nothing; don't deceive yourself. Grip. Pray heav'n, whatever's in the wallet, gold Or silver, all may be reduc'd to ashes! [Exit Gripus. SCENE IX. DÆMONES alone. Th'encouraging of servants in their crimes Is one main reason, why we have such bad ones.— This fellow here of mine, had he combin'd With any other rascal of a servant, He would have made himself and his accomplice Both guilty of a theft, and when he thought That he had got a prize, himself the while Had been a prize: one prize had caught another.— Now will I in, and sacrifice, and then Give order for the supper to be drest. [Exit. The end of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter PLEUSIDIPPUS and TRACHALIO. PLEUSIDIPPUS. Tell it me o'er and o'er, repeat it all Again, Trachalio, and again;—my life! My friend! my patron! nay, my father rather!— Tell me, oh tell me,—has Palæstra found Her parents? Trach. She has found them. Pleu. And is she My countrywoman? Trach. I think so. Pleu. And am I To marry her? Trach. I suspect so. Pleu. And d'ye think, That he'll betroth her to me? Trach. So I reckon. Pleu. And shall I then congratulate her father, That she is found? Trach. I count so. Pleu. And her mother? Trach. I reckon so. Pleu. You reckon? what's your reckoning? Trach. I reckon, 'tis exactly as you say. Pleu. Then tell me what's th'amount? Trach. Th'amount? I reckon— Pleu. Don't be for ever reckoning: what's the total? Trach. I reckon— Pleu. Should I not walk fast? Trach. I count so. Pleu. Or rather gently in this pace? Trach. I count so. Pleu. Should I address her, when I come? Trach. I count so. Pleu. Her father too? Trach. I count so. Pleu. Then her mother? Trach. I count so. Pleu. What besides? Should I embrace Her father, on my coming?— Trach. I count not. Pleu. Her mother?— Trach. I count not. Pleu. The maid herself? Trach. I count not. Pleu. Woe is me! his 'count is clos'd: He counts not, when I'd have him count. Trach. You're mad: Follow me. Pleu. Lead, my patron, where you will. [They go into Dæmones's House. SCENE II. Enter LABRAX at a Distance. Was ever man so wretched? Pleusidippus Has cast me 'fore the judges, and Palæstra Is taken from me by award.—I'm ruin'd!— Sure men of my profession are created For sport alone, since all men are rejoic'd When any evil does betide a pimp.— Well,—to the Temple I'll now go, and find That other damsel, which is mine:—at least I'll bear off Ampelisca:—she is all That's left me of my property. SCENE III. Enter GRIPUS with a Spit, from DÆMONES's House. (Entering.) By heav'ns Ye shall not see Gripus alive to-night, Unless the wallet be restor'd to me. Lab. (Over-hearing) Oh! at the very mention of a wallet I'm ready to drop down, just as if somebody Had struck me with a large stake o'er the breast. Grip. That rascal there has got his freedom by it; But I, who caught this wallet with my net, I,—ye refuse to give him any thing. Lab. O ye immortal Gods! this fellow makes me Prick up my ears at what he says. Grip. 'Fore heav'n I'll have it posted up all round about In letters a yard long, “If any one “Has lost a wallet full of gold and silver, “Let him repair to Gripus.”—Ye sha'n't carry it, As ye imagine. Lab. Verily this fellow Knows who has got My wallet.—I'll accost him. (Dæmones, or some one else, calls Gripus from within.) Grip. Why do you call me in again? I'd scour This spit without doors where I am.—(Scouring the spit) In troth It's made of rust, not iron; and the more I rub it, still more red it grows, and slenderer. This spit has spit itself in a consumption, It falls away, it wasts so in my hands. Lab. (Advancing.) Save you, young man. Grip. Heav'ns bless you, Goodman Baldpate. Lab. What are you at? Grip. Scouring this spit. Lab. How do you? Grip. Why do you ask? Are you a doctor pray, A medicant? Lab. I'm more, more by one letter. Grip. I understand you; you're a mendicant, A beggar? Lab. You have hit it. Grip. So I thought By your appearance.—What's the matter with you? Lab. I was involv'd o'er head and ears, deep in for't Last night at sea; my ship was cast away, And I lost all that I was worth. Grip. What lost you? Lab. I lost a wallet full of gold and silver. Grip. Do you remember what was in the wallet? Lab. What signifies it, when 'tis lost? Grip. Well, well! then,— If not of this, let's talk of something else.— What if I know who found it?—Prithee now Tell me the marks, inform me what was in it. Lab. There were eight hundred pieces in a bag, All gold, besides an hundred Philippeans In a small scrip of leather by itself. Grip. (Aside.) 'Fore heav'n a noble prize, and I shall get A large reward for finding it.—The Gods Respect poor mortals.—I shall go from hence Laden with spoil.—'Tis certainly his wallet.— (To Lab.) Proceed. Lab. A silver talent in a purse, A bowl, a boat, an ewer, and a goblet. Grip. Most wonderful!—You had a world of riches. Lab. O 'tis a sad word and a vile one, Had,— T'have had and not to have. Grip. What will you give The party, that shall find and tell you of it? Speak quick. Lab. Three hundred pieces. Grip. A mere feather. Lab. Four hundred. Grip. Rotten thread. Lab. Five hundred. Grip. Nutshells. Lab. Six hundred. Grip. Mites. Lab. I'll give sev'n hundred. Grip. Why D'ye keep your mouth so close? are you afraid To open it for fear of catching cold? Lab. I'll give a thousand pieces. Grip. You are dreaming. Lab. I'll give no more: begone. Grip. But hearkye me, If I once go, I come not here again. Lab. What if I add an hundred to the thousand. Grip. Poh! you're asleep. Lab. Speak, how much would you have? Grip. Well then,—to make but one word,—a great talent; That is the price; I will not bate a doit: Therefore say ay or no. Lab. (Aside.) I see I'm forc'd to't.— (To Gripus.) A talent shall be giv'n. Grip. (Going to the altar.) Come hither then. Venus shall be a party to th'agreement. Lab. Command me what you will. Grip. Here,—touch the altar. Lab. I touch it. Grip. By this Goddess you must swear— Lab. What must I swear? Grip. What I shall order you. Lab. Well—dictate what you will. (Aside.) I need not borrow Of any one what I've at home in plenty. Grip. Take hold here of the altar. Lab. I have hold on't. Grip. Swear, you will pay me what we have agreed on, As soon as you've possession of the wallet. Lab. I will. Gripus speaks, and Labrax repeats after him. Cyrenian Venus, bear me witness, If I shall find this wallet, which I lost, With all the gold and silver, and it come Safe into my possession,— Grip. “Then, I promise “This present Gripus,”—(To Lab.) Say so after me, And lay your hand upon me. Lab. Then, I promise This present Gripus,— Grip. and Lab. Venus be my witness,— That I will give him a great silver talent. Grip. Say,—If you cozen me, let Venus then Destroy you root and branch in your profession. (Aside.) And be it so, the moment you have sworn! Lab. O Venus, if I falsify my oath, May curses light on me and all Procurers. Grip. (Aside.) And so they will, though you should keep your oath.— (To Labrax,) Stay here:—I'll bring the old man out:—Be sure You challenge him directly with the wallet. [Gripus goes in. Lab. So—though he help me to my wallet, yet I owe him not a doit. Myself am judge Of what my tongue does swear.—Hush,—here he comes, And the old gentleman along with him. SCENE IV. Enter GRIPUS, and DÆMONES, with the Wallet. GRIPUS, to Dæmones in entering. Follow me this way.—Where is this Procurer?— (Calling.) Ho!—Hearkye!—Ho there!— (To Labrax.) He has got your wallet. Dæm. I have it; I confess, that I have got it: If it be your's, e'en take it.—All that's in it Shall be return'd you safe and whole.—Then take it, If it be your's. Lab. O ye immortal Powers! 'Tis mine.—Welcome, dear wallet! Dæm. Is it your's? Lab. Mine, do you ask?—By heav'ns, if Jove himself Had got it, it were mine. Dæm. There's nothing touch'd, Except one little casket, that contain'd Some trinkets, which I found my daughter by. Lab. Daughter? what daughter? Dæm. She that was your property, Palæstra;—she is found to be my daughter. Lab. 'Tis a rare chance by heav'ns; and I am glad, That things have happen'd to your wish so luckily. Dæm. I hardly can believe you. Lab. To convince you That I am glad, you shall not pay one doit; I'll give her to you. Dæm. You oblige me. Lab. Nay The obligation's on my side, good Sir. (Takes the wallet.) Grip. Hearkye! you've got the wallet now. Lab. I have it. Grip. Come, quick then. Lab. Quick then? what? Grip. Give me the money. Lab. I'll neither give, nor do I owe you aught. Grip. What dealing's this? Not owe me? Lab. No indeed. Grip. Did you not swear? Lab. I swore; and I will swear Whate'er I please. Oaths were contriv'd to guard, Not to destroy our property. Grip. Come pay me The silver talent, thou most perjur'd knave! Dæm. Gripus, what talent? Grip. Which he swore to give me. Lab. I chose to swear: what then?—Are you a Pontiff, That you can fine me for my perjury? Dæm. On what occasion promis'd he this money? Grip. He swore, if I would help him to his wallet, That he would give me a great silver talent. Lab. Get one to go with me before a judge, Where I will prove you trick'd me in the bargain: Besides, I'm under age. Grip. Here,—go with Him. (Pointing to Dæmones.) Lab. No, I must have some other: he's your master. Dæm. You shall not carry off this wallet from him, Till I have found him guilty.—Did you promise him The money? Lab. I confess it. Dæm. What you promis'd My servant, of a right belongs to me.— Don't think your pimp's tricks will avail you here: They will not do. Grip. You thought, that you had got A fool to deal with, one that you could cozen. Come, pay the money down: and I will give it Directly to my master for my freedom. Dæm. Since I have been so courteous, and through me These things were sav'd,— Grip. Through me, say not through you. Dæm. (To Grip.) Don't be a fool, but hold your tongue: (To Labrax.) You ought On your part to return the obligation. Lab. Yes truly! you defend my right so well! Dæm. 'Twere strange indeed, should I defend your right To my own disadvantage. Grip. So,—all's well: The pimp grows softer: I foresee my freedom. Dæm. This fellow found your wallet, he's my slave, And I have sav'd it for you with it's treasure. Lab. I thank you for't; and now I see no reason But you should have the talent which I promis'd. Grip. Hearkye me! come then,—if you're wise, come give it me. Dæm. Won't you be quiet? Grip. You pretend forsooth You're taking of my part, when all the while 'Tis for yourself you're acting.—Though I've lost One prize, you shall not chouse me out of this. Dæm. Speak but another word, I'll have you drub'd. Grip. Nay, you may even kill me, but I'll not Be silent, till my mouth's stopt with a talent. Lab. 'Tis for your interest he's concern'd: be quiet. Dæm. (To Labrax.) Come hither, step aside here. Lab. If you please. (Dæmones and Labrax walk on one side.) Grip. Do all above board; I will have no whisperings. Dæm. What was the price you gave for Ampelisca, That other girl? Lab. I paid a thousand pieces. Dæm. Say, shall I make a fair and good proposal? Lab. I am content, Sir. Dæm. I'll divide the talent. Lab. 'Tis well. Dæm. Yourself take one half for her freedom; The other give to Gripus. Lab. Very well. Dæm. And for that half I'll set the fellow free, Through whom you found your wallet, I my daughter. Lab. I thank you heartily: 'tis rightly done. Grip. Well, shall I have the money out of hand? Dæm. Th'affair is settled, Gripus: I have got it. Grip. Faith I had rather though, that I had got it. Dæm. There's nothing for you, therefore don't expect it.— You must release him of his oath. Grip. I'm ruin'd! I shall be dead, if I don't han0g myself.— You shall not cozen me a second time. Dæm. Labrax, you'll sup with me. Lab. Agreed, with pleasure. Dæm. Come with me in now both of you.— (He addresses himself to the Spectators.) —Spectators, I would invite You too, but I have nought To give you, I have no good chear within; Besides, I fancy you're bid forth to supper. If it shall please you to applaud our play, I do invite you all to a collation Sixteen years hence.— (To Labrax and Gripus.) You two will sup with me To-night. Lab. With pleasure. Dæm. (To the Spectators.) Give us your applause. [Exeunt. The End of the Second Volume.</field>
