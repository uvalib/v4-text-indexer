      <field name="fulltext">Amends for Ladies. A Comedie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primi ScÃ¦na prima. Enter the Lady Honor, the Lady Perfect, the Lady Bright. Maid. A Wife the happiest state? It cannot be. Wife. Yes, such a wife as I, that haue a man As if my selfe had made him: such a one As I may iustly say, I am the rib Belonging to his brest. Widow and Maide, Your liues compar'd to mine are miserable, Though wealth and beautie meete in each of you. Poore virgin, all thy sport is thought of loue, And meditation of a man, the time And circumstance ere thou canst fixe thy thoughts On one thy fancy will approue. Maid. That trouble already may be past. Wife. Why if it be. The doubt, hee will not hold his brittle saith, That he is not a competible choise, And so your noble friends will crosse the match, Doth make your happinesse vncertaine still: Or say you marryed him, what hee would proue. Can you compare your state then to a Wife? Maide. Nay, all the freedome that a virgin hath Is much to be preferr'd. Who would endure The humours of so insolent a Thing As is a husband? Which of all the Heard Runs not possessed with some notorious vice, Drinking or whoring, fighting, Iealousie, Euen of a Page at twelue, or of a Groome, That rubs horse-heeles? Is it not daily seene, Men take wiues, but to dresse their meate, to wash And starch their linnen: for the other matter Of lying with them, that's but when they please: And whatsoere the ioy be of the bed, The pangs that follow procreation Are hideous, or you wiues haue guld your husbands With your loud shrikings, and your deathfull throes. A Wife or Widow to a Virgins life? Widow. Why should the best of you thinke yee inioy The rest and rule, that a free widow doth? I am mine owne commander, and the blisse Of wooers, and of each varietie Frequents me, as I were a maide. No Brother Haue I to dice my patrimony away, as you My maiden Madame may. No husbands death Stand I in doubt on: for thankes be to heauen (If mine were good) the grieuous losse of him Is not to come; if hee were bad, hee's gone, And I no more embrace my iniury. But be yours ill, you nightly claspe your hate; Or good, why he may dye, or change his vertue. And thou (though single) hast a bed-fellow As bad as the worst husband, thought of one, And what that is, men with their wiues do doe, And long expectance till the deed be done. âA wife is like a garment vsde and torne: âA maide like one made vp, but neuer worne. Maide. âA widow is a garment worne thred-bare, Selling at second hand, like Brokers ware. But let vs speake of things the present time Make happy to vs, and see what is best. I haue a seruant then the crowne of men, The fountaine of Humanitie, the prize Of euery vertue, Morall and Diuine; Young, valiant, learned, well-borne, rich and shap'd As if wife Nature when she fashioned him, Had meant to giue him nothing but his forme, Yet all additions are conferr'd on him, That may delight a woman: this same youth To me hath sacrific'd his heart, yet I Haue checkt his suite, laught at his worthy seruice, Made him the exercise of my crueltie, Whilst constant as the Sunne, for all these clouds His loue goes on. Enter Ingen. Widow. Peace, here's the man you name. Wife., Widow. Wee'll stand aside. Ing. Good morrow to the glory of our age. Meeting the Wife &amp; Wid. The Lady Perfect, and the Lady Bright, The vertuous wife and widow: but to you The Lady Honor, and my Mistresse. The happinesse of your wishes. Maid. By this light, I neuer heard one speake so scuruily, Vtter such stale wit, and pronounce so ill. But to you, My Lady Honor, and my Mistresse, The happinesse of your wishes. Ingen. Stop your wit, You would faine shew these Ladies what a hand You hold ouer your seruant. T' shall not neede, I will expresse your tyranny well enough. I haue lou'd this Lady since I was a childe, Since I could construe Amo: now she saies I doe not loue her, 'cause I doe not weepe, Lay mine armes ore my heart, and weare no gatters, Walke with mine eyes in my hat, sigh, and make faces For all the Poets in the towne to laugh at, Poxe a this howling loue, ti's like a dogg Shut out at midnight. Must loue needs be poudred, Lie steept in brine; or will it not keepe sweet? Is it like beefe in sommer? Maid. Did you euer Heare one talke fustian like a Butcher thus? Ingen. T'is foolish, this same telling folkes we loue, It needs no words, t'will show it selfe in deeds, And did I take you for an entertainer, A Lady that will wring one by the finger, Whil'st on anothers toes shee treads, and cries By Gad I loue but one, and you are hee: Either of them thinking himselfe the man, I'de tell you in your eare, put for the busines, Which graunted, or denied, Maddam God b'wee. Maid. Come these are daily slaunders that you raise, On our infirme and vnresisting Sexe, You neuer met I am sure with such a Lady. Ingen. Oh many by this light, I haue seene a Chamber Frequented like an office of the Law, Clients succeede at midnight one another: Whilst the poore Maddam hath beene so distrest, Which of her Loues to show most countenance to, That hir dull Husband ha's perceiu'd her wiles. Maid. Nay perhaps taught her, many of those Husbands Are base enough To liue vpon't. Ingen. I haue seene another of 'em Cheat by this light at Cardes, and set her women, To talke to the Gentlemen that plaid, That so distracted they might ouer see. Maid. Oh fie vpon yee, I dare sweare you lie. Ingen. Doe not faire Mistresse, you will be forsworne. Maid. You men are all foule mouth'd, I warrant, you Talke thus of me and other Ladies here, Because we keepe the Cittie. Ingen. Oh prophane. That thought would damne me, will you marrie yet? Maid. No I will neuer marry. Ingen. Shall we then Couple vnlawfully? for indeed this marrying Is but proclaming what we meane to doe; Which may be done priuatly, in ciuill sort And none the wiser, and by this white hand La: The wrack, Strapado, or the boiling boote, Should neuer force me tell to wrong your honor. Maid. May I beleeue this? Ingen. Let it bee your Creed. Maid. But if you should proue false. Nay ne'er vnhang Your sword, except you meane to hang your selfe: Why where haue you beene drinking? 'sfoot you talke Like one of these same rambling boies, That raigne in Turnebull-street. Ingen. How doe you know? Maid. Indeed my knowledge, is but speculatiue Not practique there, I haue it by Relation, From such obseruers as your selfe deare Seruant, I must professe, I did thinke well of thee, But get thee from my sight, I neuer more Will heare or see thee, but will hate thee deadly, As a man enemy, or a woman turn'd. Enter Widdow, Wife. Ladies come forth, see Sir what Curtesie You haue done to mee, a strange praise of you Had newly left my lips, iust, as you entred, And how you haue deseru'd it, with your carriage? Villain, thou hast hurt mine honor to these friends, For what can they imagine but some ill Hath past betwixt vs by thy broad discourse? Were my case theirs, by Virgin Chastity, I should condemne them: hence, depart my sight. Ingen. Madam, but here mee, oh that these were men, And durst but say or thinke you ill, for this I haue so good a cause vpon my side, That I would cut their hearts out of their brests: And the thoughts out of them that iniur'd you. But I obay your best, and for my pennance, Will run a course neuer to see you more, And now I loose you, may I loose the light: Since in that beauty dwelt my day or night. Exit Ingen. Widd. Is this the vertuous youth? Wife. Your happines? Widd. Wherein you thought your seat so far 'boue ours, Maid. If one man could be good, this had beene hee. Enter Svbtle, Hvsband, Feesimple, Wel-tri'd. See here comes all your sutors, and your Husband, And roome for Laughter, heer's the Lord Feesimple, What Gentlewoman do's hee bring along? Enter Hvsband, embracing Svbtle, the Lord Feesimple, with young Bovld like awaiting Gentlewoman. VVel-tri'd, Hvsb: Svbtle talke with Wife. Fees. One and thirty good-morrows to the fairest, wisest, chastest, richest VViddow that euer conuersation coapt withall. Widd. Three score and two vnto the wisest Lord, That euer was train'd in vniuersitie. Feesimp. Oh Curteous, bounteous Widow, shee ha's outbid me 31. Good morrowes at a clap. Welt. But my Lord Feesimple you forgot the busines impos'd on you. Fees. Gentlewoman, I crie thee mercie, but ti's a fault in all Lords, not in mee only, we doe vse to sweare by our Honors: and as we are Noble, to dispatch such a businesse for such a Gentleman and wee are bound, euen by the same Honors wee sware by, to forget it in a quarter of an houre. And looke as if wee had neuer seene the Partie, when wee meete next, especially if none of our Gentlemen haue bin considered. Welt. I, but all your's haue, for you keepe none my Lord: Besides though it stands with your Honor to forget mens businesses; yet it stands not with your Honor, if you doe not doe a womans. Feesi. Why then Maddam, so it is that I request your Ladiship to accept into your seruice this Gentlewoman, for her truth &amp; honestie I will be bound, I haue knowne her too long to be deceiu'd, this is the second time I haue seene her. Maid. Why how now my Lord: a preferrer of Gentlewomen to seruice like an old knitting woman? where hath Shee dwelt before. Feesi. Shee dwelt with young Boulds sister, hee that is my Corriuall in your Loue, she requested me to aduance her to You; for you are a dub'd Lady: so is not shee yet. Welt. But now you talk of yong Bould, when did you see him Lady? Wid. Not this month Maister Well-tri'd. I did coniure him to forbeare my sight: Indeed swore if he came Il'd be denied, But tis strange you should aske for him, yee two were wont neuer to be asunder. Welt. Faith Maddam we neuer were together but wee differd on some argument or other, And doubting least our discord might at length Breed to some quarrell, I forbeare him to. Fees. He quarrell? Bould: hang him, if he durst haue quarrel'd, the world knowes hee's within a mile of an oke ha's put him too't, and soundly, I neuer car'd for him in my life, but to see his sister, hee's an asse, pox an arrant asse, for doe you thinke any but an arrant asse, would offer to come a wooing, where a Lord atempts? he quarrell: hee dares not quarrell. Welt. But hee dares fight my Lord, vpon my knowledge, And raile no more my Lord, behind his back, For if you doe my Lord bloud must insue. Drawes. Fees. Oh, oh my honor dies, I am dead. Welt. Vd'slight whats the matter, wring him by the nose Widd. A paire of riding spurs now were worth gold, Maid. Pins are as good, prick him, prick him Feesim. Oh, oh. Wife. Hee's come againe, lift him vp. Omnes. How fares your Lordship? Fees. Oh friends, you haue wrong'd my spirit to call it backe, I was ee'n in Elizium at rest. Welt. But why sir did you sowne? Feesi. Well though I die Maister Wel-tri'd before all these I doe forgiue you, because you were ignorant of my infirmitie, oh sir, i'st not vp yet, I die againe, put vp now whil'st I winke, or I doe winke for euer. Welt. Ti's vp my Lord, ope your eies, but I pray tell mee Is this antipathie twixt bright steele and you naturall, or how grew it? Feesi. Il'e tell you sir, any thing bright and edg'd, works thus strongly with me, your hilts now I can handle as boldlie, looke you else. Knight. Nay neuer blame my Lord, Maister Well-tri'd, for I know a great manie will sowne at the sight of a shoulder of mutton or a quarter of Lambe, my Lord may be excus'd then, for a naked sword. Welt. This Lord, and this knight in dogge-collers would make a fine brace of beagles. Maid. But on my faith twas mightily ouerseene of your father, not to bring you vp to foyles, or if hee had bound you Prentise to a Cutler or an Ire-monger. Fees. I a poxe, hang him old gouty foole, he neuer brought me vp to any Lordly exercise, as fencing, dancing, tumbling, and such like: but forsooth I must write and reade, &amp; speake languages, and such base qualities, fit for none but Gentlemen. Now sir would I tell him, Father you are a Count, I am a Lo: a poxe a writing and reading, and languages, let mee be brought vp as I was borne. Subtle. But how my Lord came you first not to indure the sight of steele. Feesi. Why I'le tell you Sir, when I was a child, an infant, an Innocent. Maid. T'was e'ne now. Fees. I being in the kitchin, in my Lo: my fathers house, the Cooke was making minc'd pyes: so sir, I standing by the Dresser, there lay a heape of plums. Here was hee mincing; what did mee I sir, being a not able little witty coxcombe, but popt my hand iust vnder his chopping knife, to snatch some Reysins, and so was cut ore the hand, and neuer since could I endure the sight of any edge-toole. Wid. Indeede they are not fit for you my Lord, and now you are all so well satisfied in this matter, pray Ladies now like you this my Gentlewoman? Maid. In troth Maddam exceeding well I, if you be prouided, pray let me haue her. Wife. It should be my request, but that I am full. Wid. What can you doe? What's her name my Lord? Fees. Her name? I know not. What's her name M r. Well-try'd? Weltr. Her name? slid, tell my Lady your name. Bould. Mistresse Mary Princox forsooth. Wid. Mistresse Mary Princox: she has wit, I perceiue that already. Mee thinkes she speakes as if she were a my Lords brood. Bould. Brood Maddame, 'tis well knowne I am a Gentlewoman. My father was a man of 500. per annum, and hee held something in Capite too. Welt. So does my Lord, something. Fees. Nay, by my troth, what I hold in capite is worth little or nothing. Bould. I haue had apt breeding, how euer my misfortune now makes me submit my selfe to seruice: but there is no ebbe so low, but hath his tyde againe: when our dayes are at worst, they will mend in spight of the frowning Destinies, For wee cannot be lower then earth, and the same blinde Dame that hath cast her bleare eyes hitherto vpon my occasions, may turne her wheele, and at last winde them vp with her white hand to some pinnacle that prosperously may flourish in the Sunne-shine of promotion. Fees. Oh mouth, full of agilitie, I would giue 20. Markes now to any person that could teach mee to conuey my tongue (sance stumbling) with such dexteritie to such a period. For her truth and her honesty I am bound before, but now I haue heard her talke, for her wit I will be bound body and goods. Wid. V'dslight, I will not leaue her for my hood. I neuer met with one of these eloquent old Gentlewomen before. What age are you Mistresse Mary Princox? Bould. I will not lye Maddam, I haue numbred 57. Summers, and iust so many winters haue I past. Subt. But they haue not past you, they lye frozen in your face. Bould. Maddam, if it shall please you to entertaine me, so: if not, I desire you not to misconstrue my good will, there's no harme done, the doore's as big as it was, and your Ladiships owne wishes crowne your beauty with content. As for these frumping Gallants, let them doe their worst: it is not in mans power to hurt mee: 'tis well knowne I come not to be scoff'd. A woman may beare and beare till her backe burst. I am a poore Gentlewoman, and since vertue has now a dayes no other companion but pouerty, I set the Hares head against the Goole giblets, and what I want one way I hope I shall be inabled to supply the other. Fees. A'nt please God, that thou wert not past children; Wid. Ist e'ne so my Lord? nay good Princox do not crie, I doe entertaine you, how doe you occupie? what can you vse? Bould. Any thing fit to be put into the hands of a Gentlewoman. Wid. What are your qualities? Bould. I can sleepe on a low stoole, if your Lady-ship be talking in the same roome with any Gentle-man, I can reade on a booke, sing loue songs, looke vp at the loouer light, heare and be deafe, see and be blind, be euer dumb to your secrets, sweare and equiuocate, and whatsoeuer I spie, say the best. Wid. Oh rare Croane? how art thou endu'd? but why did Master Boulds sister put you away? Bould. I beseech you Madame to neglect that desire, though I know your Lady-ships vnderstanding to be sufficient to partake or take in the greatest secret; can be imparted: yet.â Wid. Nay prithie tell the cause, come heer's none but freinds. Bould. Faith Madame, heigh ho, I was (to confesse truly) a little foolish in my last seruice, to beleeue mens oaths, but I hope my example, though preiudiciall to my selfe, will be beneficiall to other yong Gentle-women in seruice, my mistresses brother (the Gentle-man you nam'd e'now, master Bould) hauing often attempted my honor, but finding it impregnable, vow'd loue, and marriage to me, at the last, I, a yong thing and raw, being seduced, set my minde vpon him, but friends contradicting the match, I fell into a greiuous consumption, and vpon my first recouerie, least the intended sacred ceremonies of Nuptials should succede, his sister knowing this, thought it fit in her iudgement, we should be farther a sunder, and so put me out of her seruice. Omnes. Ha, ha, ha. Wid. God a mercie for this discouerie ifaith, Oh man what art thou? when thy cock is vp? come wil your lordship walke in? tis dinner time. Enter hastily M. Seldome with papers on his arme. Omnes. Whose this? whose this? Maid. This is our Land-lord, Master Seldome, An exceeding wife Citizen, a very sufficient vnderstanding man, and exceeding rich. Om. Miracles are not ceasd. Wid. Good morrow Land-lord, where haue you beene sweating? Seld. Good morrow to your Honors, thrift is industrious, your Lady-ship knowes we will not stick to sweat for our pleasures, how much more ought wee to sweat for our profits? I am come from master Ingen this morning who is married or to be married, and though your Ladyships did not honor his Nuptials with your presence, he hath by me sent each of you a paire of gloues, and Grace Seldome my wife is not forgot. Exit. Omnes. God giue him ioy, God giue him ioy. Exeunt. Maid. Let all things most impossible change now. Oh periur'd man! oathes are but words I see. But wherefore should not we that thinke we loue Vpon full merrit, that same worth once ceasing Surcease our loue to, and finde new desert? Alas we cannot, loue's a pit, which, when We fall into we ne're get out againe, And this same horrid newes which me assaults I would forget, loue blanches blackest faults: Oh! what path shall I treade for remedie? But darkest shades, where loue with death doth lie. Exit. Manent Hvsband, Wife, Svbtle. Wife. Sir I haue often heard my husband speake of your acquaintance. Husb. Nay my vertuous wife, Had it beene but acquaintance, this his absence Had not appear'd so vncouth, but we two Were Schoole-fellowes together, borne and nurs'd, Brought vp, and liu'd since like the Gemins, Had but one suck, the Tauerne or the Ordinarie. Ere I was married, that saw one of vs Without the other, said we walk't by halfes, Where deere, deere friend haue you beene all this while? Subt. Oh most sweet friend the World's so vicious, That had I with such familiaritie Frequented you since you were married, Possess'd and vs'd your fortunes as before, As in like maner you commanded mine, The deprau'd thoughts of men would haue proclaim'd Some scandalous rumors from this loue of ours, As saying, mine reflected on your Ladie, And what a wound had that beene to our soules? When only friend-ship should haue beene the ground To hurt her Honor, and your confident peace, Spight of mine owne approu'd integritie. Husb. Wife, kisse him, bid him welcome pox o'th World, Come, come you shall not part from me in hast, I doe command thee vse this Gentle-man In all things like my selfe, if I should die I would bequeath him in my will to thee. Wife. Sir, you are most welcome, &amp; let scandalous tongues No more deterre you, I dare vse you Sir, With all the right belonging to a friend, And what I dare, I dare let all men see My conscience rather, then mens thoughts be free. Husb. Will you looke in? Wee'le follow you. Now friend Exit. Wife. What thinke you of this Ladie? Subt. Why sweet friend, That you are happie in her, shee is faire, Wittie and vertuous, and was rich to you, Can there be an addition to a wife? Husb. Yes, constancie, for t'is not chastitie That liues remote from all attempters free, But there, ti's strong and pure where all that wooe It doth resist, and turnes them vertuous too; Therefore deere friend, by this, loues masculine kisse, By all our mutuall engagements past, By all the hopes of amitie to come, Be you the setler of my jealous thoughts, And make me kill my fond suspect of her, By assurance that shee is loyall, otherwise That shee is false, and then, as shee's past cure, My soule shall euer after be past care. That you are fittest for this enterprize You must needs vnderstand, since prooue shee true (In this your tryall) you my dearest friend, (Whom onely, rather than the World besides I would haue satisfied of her vertue) shall be, And best conceale my folly, proue shee weake, T'is better you should know't than any man, Who can reforme her, and doe me no wrong, Chimicall metals, and bright gold it selfe By sight are not distinguisht, but by'th test, Thought makes good wiues, but triall makes the best: To the vnskilfull owners eies, alike The Bristow sparkles as the Diamond, But by a Lapidarie the truth is found, Come you shall not denie me. Subt. Doe not wrong So faire a wife (friend) and so vertuous, Whose good name is a theame vnto the World, Make not a wound with searching where was none, Misfortune still such projects doth pursue, He makes a false wife, that suspects a true; Yet since you so importune, giue me leaue To ruminate a while, and I will straight Follow and giue you an answer. Husb. You must do it. Exit. Subt. Assure your selfe deereâCoxcombe, I will do't Or strangely be denied, all's as I wisht, This was my aime, although I haue seem'd strange. I know this fellow now to be an Asse; A most vnworthie husband though in view He beare himselfe thus faire, shee knowes this too, Therefore the stronger are my hopes to gaine her: And my deere friend that will haue your wife trid'e, I'le trie her first, then thrust her if I can, And as you said most wisely I hoped to be Both Touch-stone to your wife and Lapidarie.

Grace. What partie? Mall. The Knight Sir Iohn Louall. Grace. Hence lewd impudent I know not what to tearme thee man or woman, For nature shaming to acknowledge thee For either; hath produc'd thee to the World Without a sexe, some say thou art a woman, Others a man; and many thou art both Woman and man, but I thinke rather neither Or man and horse, as the old Centaures were faign'd. Mall. Why how now Mistris, what lack yee? are you so so fine with a poxe? I haue seene a woman looke as modestly as you, and speake as sinceerely, and follow the Fryars as zealously, and shee has beene as sound a jumbler as e're paid for't, t'is true Mris.

Marry my Lord, shee said her old husband had a great payment to make this morning, and had not left her so much as a jewell. Proud. A poxe of her old Cats chops, the teeth shee had, haue made a transmigration into haire, shee hath a bigger beard than I by this light. Sel. This custome in vs Cittizens is good, Lo: whispers to Grace. Thus walking off when men talk with our wiues, It shew's vs curteous, and mannerly, Some count it basenesse, hee's a foole that does so, It is the highest point of pollicie Espetiallie when we haue vertuous wiues. Gr. Fie, fie, you talke vnciuillie my Lord. Pr. Vnciuillie, mew, can a Lord talke vnciuilly? I thinke you a finicall taffatae pipkin may be proud ile sit so neare it, vnciuillie mew. Gr.

How dost thou Coze, hast thou got any more wit yet? Feesim. No by my troth I haue but litle money with that little wit I haue, and the more wit euer the lesse money, yet as litle as I haue of either: I would giue some thing that I durst but quarrell, I would not be abused thus daily as I am. Welt. Saue you my Lord. Gr. Good Maister Wel-tri'd, you can informe mee, pray how ended the quarrell betwixt yong Bould, and the other Gentleman. Welt. Why very fairelie my Lord, on honorable tearmes, Young Bould was iniur'd and did challenge him, Fought in the field, and the other gaue him satisfaction Vnder his hand, I was Boulds second, and can shew it heere. Pr. T'is strange there was no hurt done, yet I hold the other Gentleman, farr the better Man. Welt. So doe not I. Pr. Besides they say the satisfaction that walks in the Ordinaries, is counter-feit. Welt. He lies that saies so, and ile make it good, And for I know my frend is out of towne, What Man soeuer wrongs him is my foe, I say he had full satisfaction, Nay that which wee may call submission: That the other sought peace first, and who denies this, Lord, Knight, or Gentleman, English, French, or Scot, I'le fight and proue it on him with my sword. Feesi. No sweet Maister Well-tri'd, let's haue no fighting till (as you haue promis'd) you haue rid me from this foolish feare, and taught mee to endure to looke vppon a naked Sword. Welt. Well and il'e be as good as my word. Feesi. But doe you heare Cozen Proudly? they say my old Father must marrie your sister Honor, and that hee will disinherit me, and intaile all his Lordships on her, and the heire he shall beget on her bodie, i'st true or not? Proudly. There is such a report. Feesi. Why then I pray God he may die an ould Cuckold lie slaue, oh world what art thou? where is Parents loue?

Pr. What d'ee this afternoone. Feesi. Faith I haue a great mind to see long-megg and he ship at the Fortune. Pr. Nay afaith let's vp and haue a rest at Primero. Welt. Agreed my Lord, and toward the Euening il'e carrie you to the Companie. Feesi. Well no more words. Exeunt Lord Provdly, Lord Fees. Wel-tr. Grace. I wonder Sir you will walke so and let anie bodie fit prating to your wife! were I a man Id'e thrust 'em out ot'h shop by the head and shoulders. Sel. There were no pollicie in that wife, so should I loose their custome, let them talke them selues wearie, and giue thee loue tokens still, I loose not by it. Thy chastitie's impregnable, I know it, Had I a dame whose eies did swallow youth, Whose vnchast gulph together did take in Masters, and Men, the Foot-boies and their Lords, Making a Gally-moferie in her blood, I would not walke thus then: but vertuous wife, He that in chast eares poores his ribauld talke Begets hate to himselfe, and not consent; And euen as durt throwne hard against a wall Rebounds and sparkles in the throwers eies, So ill words vtter'd to a vertuous Dame, Turne and defile the speaker with red shame. Exeunt. Enter Hvsband and Wife. Hus. Z'oones, you are a whore, though I entreat him faire Before his face, in complement, or so, I not esteeme him truly as this rush, Ther's no such thing as friend-ship in the world, And he that can not sweare, dissemble, lie, Wants knowledge how to liue, and let him die. Wife. Sir I did thinke you had esteem'd of him As you made shew, therefore I vs'd him well, And yet not so but that the strictest eie I durst haue made a witnesse of my cariage. Husb. Plague a your carriage, why he kist your hand, Look't babies in your eies, and wink't and pink't, You thought I had esteem'd him, S'blood you whore, Doe not I know, that you doe know you lie, When did'st thou heare me say and meane one thing? Oh I could kick you now, and teare your face And eate thy Breasts like vdders. Wife. Sir you may, but if I know what hath deseru'd al this I am no woman, 'cause he kist my hand, vnwillingly. Husb. A little lowder pray. Wife. You are a base fellow, an vnworthie man As e're poore Gentlewoman match't withall, Why should you make such shew of loue to any Without the truth, thy beastly minde is like Some decai'd Tradseman that doth make his wife Entertaine those for gaine he not endures, Pish, swell and burst, I had rather with thy sword Be hew'd to peeces, then lead such a life, Out with it valiant sir, I hold you for A drawer vpon women, not on men, I will no more conceale your hollow heart, But e'ne report you as you are in truth. Husb. This is cal'd marriage, stop your mouth you whore. Wife. Thy mother was a whore if I be one. Enter Svbtle. Hus. You know ther's companie in the house, sweet friend What haue you writ your letter? Sub. T'is done, deere friend, I haue made you stay too long I feare you'll be benighted. Husb. Fie, no, no, Madame &amp; sweetest wife farewell, God blesse vs, Make much of master Subtle heere my friend kisse her. Till my returne, which may be ee'n as't happens, According as my businesse hath successe. Exit. Subt. How will you passe the time, now fairest Mistresse. Wife. In troth I know not, wiues without their husbands Me thinks are lowring daies. Subt. Indeed some wiues Are like dead bodies in their Husbands absence. Wife. If any Wife be, I must needs be so That haue a Husband farre aboue all men, Vntainted with the humors others haue, A perfect man, and one that loues you truly, You see the charge he left of your good vsage. Subt. Push, hee's an Asse, I know him, a starke Asse. Of a most barbarous condition, False-hearted to his friend, rough vnto you, A most desembling and persideous fellow, I care not if he heard me, this I know, And will make good vpon him with my sword Or any for him, for he will not fight. Wife. Fie seruant, you shew small ciuilitie And lesse humanitie, d'ee requite My husbands loue thus ill, or what d'ee thinke Of mee, that you will vtter to my face Such harsh, vnfriendly, slanderous iniuries Euen of my Husband? Sir, forbeare I pray My eares, or your owne tongue, I am no hous-wife To heare my Husbands merrit thus deprau'd. Subt. His merrit is a halter by this light, You thinke hee's out of Towne now, no such matter But gone aside, and hath importun'd me To trie your chastitie. Wife. It cannot be, Alas he is as free from jealouzie, And euer was as confidence it selfe, I know he loues me to, too heartily To be suspitious, or to proue my truth. Subt. If I doe faine in ought, ne're may I purchase The grace I hope for, and faire Misteris If you haue any spirit, or wit, or sence, You will be euen with such a wretched slaue, Heauen knowes I loue you, as the ayre I draw, Thinke but how finely you may cuckold him, And safely too, with me, who will report To him, that you are most inuincible, Your Chastitie not to be subdu'd by man. Wife. When you know, I'm a whore. Subt. A whore, fie, no, That you haue beene kind, or so, your whore doth liue In Pict-hatch, Turnebole-streete. Wife. Your whore liues there, Well Seruant leaue me to my selfe a while, Returne a-none, but beare this hope away, T'shall be with you, if I at all doe stray. Exit. Subtle. Why heer's right wordly friendship, ye are well met; Oh men! what are you? why is our poore sexe Still made the disgrac't subiects, in these plaies? For vices, follie and inconstancie? When were men look't into with such criticall eies Of obseruation, many would be found So full of grosse and base corruption, That none (vnlesse the Diuell himselfe turn'd writer) Could faine so badly, to expresse them truely; Some wiues that had a husband now like mine, Would yeeld their honors vp, to any man, Farre be it from my thoughts, oh let me stand, Thou God of marriage and chastitie, An honor to my sexe, no iniurie, Compell the vertue of my breast to yeeld, I'ts not reuenge for any wife, to staine The nuptiall bed, although she be yok't ill, Who fals, because her husband so hath done, Cures not his wound, but in her selfe makes one. Ex. Wife. Enter Ingen reading a letter, sits downe in a Chaire and stampes with his foote: to him a Seruant. Ing. Who brought this Letter? Seru. A little Irish foot-boy, Sir, he staies without for an answere. Ing. Bid him come in Lord. What deepe dissemblers are these females, all, How farre vnlike a friend, this Ladie vs'd me, And heere, how like one mad in loue, she writes: Enter Maid like an Irish foot-boy with a dart, and gloues in bir pocket, and a handkercher. So blesse me Heauen, but thou art the prettiest boy That e're ran by a Horse, hast thou dwelt long With thy faire Mistris? Maid. I came but this morning, Sir. Ing. How fares thy Ladie, boy? Maid. Like to a turtle, that hath lost her mate, Drooping shee sits, her griefe Sir cannot speake, Had it a voice articulate, we should know How, and for what shee suffers; and perhaps, (But t'is vnlikely) giue her Comfort Sir, Weeping shee sits, and all the sound comes from her, Is like the murmure of a siluer Brooke, Which her teares truely, would make there about her, Sate she in any hollow continent. Ing. Beleeue me boy, thou hast a passionate tong, Liuely expression, or thy memorie Hath carried thy lesson well away, But wherefore mournes thy Ladie? Maid. Sir, you know, And would to God I did not know my selfe, Ing. Ah las, it cannot be for loue to me, When last I saw her shee reuil'd me (boy) With bitter'st words, and wish't me neuer more To approch her sight, and for my marriage, now I doe sustaine it, as a pennance, due To the desert, that made her bannish me. Maid. Sir, I dare sweare, she did presume, no words Nor dangers, had beene powerfull to restraine Your comming to her, when she gaue the chargeâ But are you married truely? Ing. Why my Boy? Dost think I mock my selfe, I sent her gloues. Maid. The gloues she ha's return'd you Sir by me, And praies you giue them to some other Ladie That you'll deceiue next, and be periur'd to. Sure you haue wrong'd her Sir, she bad me tell you, She ne're thought goodnesse dwelt in many men, But what there was of goodnesse in the world, Shee thought you had it all, but now shee sees The jewell she esteem'd is counterfeit That, you are but a common man, your selfe, A traitor to her, and her vertuous loue; That all men are betraiers and their breasts As full of dangerous gulphes, as is the Sea, Where any woman thinking to finde Harbor, Shee and her honor are prÃ¦cipitated, And neuer to be brought with safetie off: Ah las my haplesse Ladie, desolate, Distrest, forsaken Virgin. Ing. Sure this Boy Is of an excellent nature, who so newly Tane to her seruice, feeles his Mistresse griefe, As he and they were old familiar friends, Why weep'st thou gentle Lad? Maid. Who hath one teare, And would not sau't from all occasions, From Brothers slaughters, and from mothers deaths To spend it heere, for my distressed Ladie; But Sir my Ladie did commaund me begg To see your wife, that I may bare to her The sad report, what creature could make you Vntie the hand-fast plighted vnto her. Enter his Brother like a woman maskt. Ingen kisses her. Ingen. Wife, wife, come forth-now Gentle boy, be iudge If such a face as this being paid with scorne By her I did adore, had not full power To make me marrie. Maid. By the God of Loue, Shees a faire Creature, but faith should be fairer. My Ladie, Gentle Mistresse, one that thought Shee had some intrest in this Gentleman, (Who now is onelie yours) Commaunded me To kisse your white hand, and to sigh and weepe, And wish you that content she should haue had In the fruition of her Loue you hold, She bad me say, God giue you ioy, to both; Yet this withall (if ye were married) No one, her foot-steps euer more should meete, Nor see her face, but in a winding sheete. Brother. Ahlas poore Ladie, 'faith I pittie her, And, but to be i'th same state, could forgoe Any thing I possesse, to ease her woe. Maid. Loues blessing light vpon thy gentle soule, Men raile at women Mistris, but t'is we Are false and cruell, ten times more vnkind, You are smoother farre, and of a softer mind: Sir, I haue one request more. Ing. Gentle Lad, It must be one of a strange qualitie That I denie thee, both thy forme, and minde. Informe me that thy nurture hath beene better; Than to betray thee to this present life. Maid. T'is, that you would vouchsafe to entertaine me, My feete do tremble vnder me, to beare My bodie back vnto my vncouth Ladie, To assure her griefe; what heart so hard, would owe A tongue, to tell so sad a tale to her? Ahlas, I dare not looke vpon her eies, Where wronged loue, sits like the Basilisque, And sure would kill me for my dire report, Or rather should not I appeare like death, holding vp his dart. When euery word I speak shot through her hart, More mortallie than his vasparing dart. Brother. Let me speake for the Boy. Ing. To what end (loue?) No, I will sue to him, to follow me, Introth I loue thy sweet condition, And may liue to informe thy Lady of thee; Come in drie, drie thine eies, respit thy woe: The effects of causes, crowne, or ouerthrow. Enter Lo. Provd. Lo. Feesim. Wel-tri'd, Ma. Seldome, Widd. Bovld pinning in a Ruffe, Wife. Proud. S'light, what should be become of her, you sweare she past not forth of dores, and i'th house she is not? Widd. Did you not see her Princox? Proud. This same Bawd has brought her letters from some yonger brother, and she is stole away. Bould. Bawd, I defie you, indeed your Lordship thinkes, you may make Bawds of whom you please, i'le take my oath vpon a booke, since I met her in the necessarie house i'th morning, I ne're set eye on her. Grace. Shee went not out of dores. Proud. Sure shee has an inuisible ring. Feesi. Marrie she's the honester woman, for some of their rings are visible enough, the more shame for them, still say I, let the pond at Islington be search't: goe to, there's more haue drown'd themselues for loue this yeare then you are aware of. Proud. Pish, you are a foole. Welt. S'hart call him foole againe. Feesi. By this light and I will, as soone as euer you haue shew'd me the Swaggerers. Wife. Her clothes are all yonder my Lord. Grace.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus tertius. Enter Hvsband and Svbtle. Subt. Shee's a rare wife beleeue it Sir, were all such, Wee neuer should haue false inheritors. Husb. Pish friend, there is no woman in the world Can hould out in the end, If youth, shape, wit, Met in one subiect, doe assault her aptlie, For fayling once, you must not faint but trie Another way, the path of womens minds Are crooked, and diuerse, they haue by-waies To leade you to the Pallace of their pleasures, And you must wooe discreetely; first obserue The disposition of her you attempt, If shee be sprightly, and heroicall, Possesse her that you are valiant, and haue spirit, Talke nothing but of beating euery man That is your hinderance, though you doe not doe it, Or dare not, t'is no matter. Be shee free And of a liberall soule, giue bounteously To all the seruants, let your angels flye About the roome, although you borrow'd 'em. If shee be wittie, so must your discourse Get wit, what shift so 'ere you make for it, Though't cost you all your land, and then a song Or two is not amisse, although you buy 'em, There's many in the Towne will furnish you. Subt. But still I tell you, you must vse her roughly, Beate her face black and blew, take all her cloth's And giue them to some Punke, this will be ground For me to worke vpon. Husb. All this I haue done. I haue left her now, as bare, that should I die, Her fortune (Ã´ my conscience) would be To marrie some Tobacco-man, shee has nothing But an old black-woorke wastcote, which would serue Exceeding wel to fit i'th shop and light Pipes for the lowzie Footmen (and sweete friend) First heere's a jewell to present her, then Heere is a Sonnet writ against my selfe, Which as thine owne thou shalt accost her with, Farewell and happie successe attend thee. Exit. Subt. Ha, ha, ha. [he reads. Fairest, still wilt thou be true To a man so false to thee? Did he lend a Husbands due, Thou did'st owe him loyaltie; But will curses, wants and blowes Breed no change in thy white soule? Be not a foole to thy first vowes, Since his breach, doth thy faith controle, No beautie else, could be so chast, Thinke not thou honour'st women then, Since by thy conscience, all disgrac't, Are rob'd of the deare loues of men; Then grant me my desire that vow to proue A reall husband, his adulterate loue. Tooke euer man more paines to be a Cuckold? Oh! monstrous age where men themselues we see, Studie and pay for their owne infamie. Exit. Enter Ingen, Maid, Provdly, Brother like a woman, swords drawen. Proud. Giue me my sister, Ile haue her forth thy heart. Ing. No earthly Lord can pull her out of that, Till he haue pluckt my heart first out, my Lord Wer't not inhospitable, I could wrong you heere In mine owne house, I am so full of woe, For your lost sister, that by all my ioyes Hop't for in her, my heart weepes teares of bloud, A whiter virgine, and a worthier, Had ne're creation: LÅda's Swan was black To her virginitie, and immaculate thoughts. Proud. Where hast thou hid her? giue her me againe, For by the God of vengeance, be she lost, The female hate shall spring betwixt our names, Shall neuer die, while one of either house Suruiues, our children shall at seuen yeares olde Strike kniues in one another. Ing. Let Hell gape And take me quick, if I know where she is, But am so charg'd with sorrow for her losse, Being the cause of it (as no doubt I am) That I had rather fal vpon my sword [Offering to kill himselfe Then breath a minute longer. Broth. Oh sir! hold. Proud. Thou shalt not neede, I haue a sword to bathe In thy false blood, inhumane murderer. Maid. Good Sir be pacified, i'le goe, i'le run Many a mile to finde your sister out; Shee neuer was so desperate of grace, By violence to rob her selfe of life, And so her soule in danger; comfort Sir, Shee's but retir'd somewhere on my life.

Proud. Out false dissembler, art not married? Ing. No, behold, it is my yonger brother drest, Plucks off his headtire A man, no woman, that hath guld the world, Intended for a happier euent Than this that follow'd, that she now is gone, Oh fond experiments of simple man, Foole to thy fate, since all thy project men't But mirth, is now conuerted vnto death. Maid. Oh doe not burst me joy, that modestie aside. Would let me show my selfe to finish all. Proud. Nay, then thou hast my sister somewhere villain, T'is plaine now, thou wilt steale thy marriage, Shee is no match for thee, assure thy selfe. If all the law in England, or my friends Can crosse it, t'shall not be. Ing. Would t'were so well, And that I knew the Ladie to be safe. Giue me no ill words; Sir, this Boy and I Will wander like two Pilgrimes, till we finde her: If you doe loue her as you talke, doe so: The loue or griefe that is exprest in words, Is sleight and easie, t'is but shallow woe That makes a noise, deep'st waters stillest goe; I loue her better then thy parents did, Which is beyond a Brother. Proud. Slaue, thou liest. Ing. Z'oones. [about to strike Broth. Kill him. Maid. Oh hold; Sir, you dishonour much your brother, To counsaile him 'gainst hospitalitie, To strike in his owne house. Ing.

But by the others losse, I must find death, Oh odious brother, if he kill my loue: Oh bloodie Loue, if he should kill my brother; Dispaire on both sides of my discontent, Tel's me no safetie rests but to preuent. Exit. Enter Widdovv and Bovld like Princox. Wid. What's a clock Princox? Bould. Bed-time an't please you Madame. Wid. Come, vndresse me, would God had made me a man. Bould. Why, Madame? Wid. Because I would haue beene in bed as soone as they, wee are so long vnpinning and vnlacing. Bou. Yet many of vs Madame are quickly vndone sometime, but heerein we haue the aduantage of men, though they can be a bed sooner than we, i'ts a great while when they are a bed e're they can get vp. Wid. Indeed if they be well laid Princox, one cannot get them vp againe in hast. Bould. Oh God Madame, how meane you that, I hope you know, ill things taken into a Gentlewomans eares, are the quick corrupters of maiden modestie, I would be loath to continue in any seruice vnfit for my virgin estate, or where the world should take any notice of light behauiour in the Ladie I follow: for Madame, the maine point of chastitie in a Ladie, is to build the rock of a good opinion amongst the people by circumstances, and a faire shew she must make, Si, von caste, tamen caute Madame, and though wit be a wanton Madame: yet I beseech your Lady-ship for your owne credit and mine, let the bridle of judgement be alwaies in the chaps of it to giue it head, or restraine it, according as time and place shall be conuenient. Wid. Precise and learned Princox, dost not thou goe to Black-fryers. Bould. Most frequently Madame, vnworthy vessell that I am to partake or retaine any of the delicious dew, that is there distilled. Wid. But why shouldst thou aske me what I meant e'ne now, I tell thee there's nothing vtter'd that carries a double sence, one good, one bad, but if the hearer applie it to the worst, the fault lies in his or her corrupt vnderstanding, not in the speaker, for to answere your lattine: prauis omnia praua, beleiue me wench, if ill come into my fancie, I will purge it by speech, the lesse will remaine within: a pox of these nise mouth'd creatures, I haue seen a norrow paire of lips vtter as broad a taile, as can be bought for money; Indeed an ill tale vnutter'd, is like a maggot in a nut, it spoiles the whitest kernell. Bould. You speake most intellegently Madame. Wid. Ha'st not done yet? thou art an old fumbler I perceiue: me thinkes thou doest not do things like a woman. Bould. Madame, I doe my endeauour, and the best can doe no more, they that could doe better, it may be would not, and then t'were all one, but rather then be a burthen to your Lady-ship, I protest sincerely, I would beg my bread, therefore I beseech you Madame to hold me excus'd, and let my good will stand for the action. Wid. Let thy good will stand for the action? If good will would doe it, there's many a Ladie in this Land would be content with her old Lord, and thou canst not be a burthen to me, without thou lie vpon me, and that were preposterous in thy sexe; take no exceptions at what I say, remember you said stand e'ne-now, there was a word for one of your coate indeede. Bould. I sweare Madame, you are verie merrie, God send you good luck, ha's your Ladyship no waters, that you vse at bed-time? Wid. No introth, Princox. Bould. No Complexion? Wid. None but mine own I sweare, did'st thou euer vse any? Bould. No indeede Madame: now and then a peece of scarlet, or so; a little white and red Cerusse; but in troth Madame, I haue an excellent receipt for a night masque, as euer you heard. Wid. What is it? Bould. Bores grease one ounce, Iordane Almouds blanch't and ground a quarterne, red Rose-water, halfe a pint, Mares vrine, newly couer'd, halfe a score drops. Wid. Fough, no more of thy medicine, if thou lou'st me, few of our Knights errant, when they meete a faire Ladie arrant, in a morning, would thinke her face had lien so plaster'd all night: thou hast had some Apothecarie to thy sweet heart: but leauing this face physick, for (by my troth) it may make others haue good ones; but it makes me make a scuruie one. Which of all the Gallants in the Towne would'st thou make a husband of, if thou might'st haue him for thy chusing? Bould. In troth Madame, but you'll say I speake blindly, but let my loue stand a side. Wid. I think it not fit indeede your loue should stand in the middle. Boul. I say Master Bould; oh, do but marke him Madame, his leg, his hand, his bodie, &amp; all his members standin print. Wid. Out vpon thee Princox; no, me thinkes Wel-tri'ds a handsome fellow, I like not these starch't Gallants: masculine faces, and masculine gestures please me best. Bould. How like you Master Pert? Wid. Fie vpon him, when he is in his skarlet clothes, he lookes like a man of waxe, and I had as leue haue a dogge a waxe, I do not thinke but he lies in a case a nights, he walkes as if he were made of gyns, as if nature had wrought him in a frame, I haue seene him sit discontented a whole play, because one of the purles of his band was fallen (out of his reach) to order againe. Bould. Why? Bould Madame is cleane contrarie. Wid. I but that's as ill, each extreame, is a like vitious; his carefull carelesnesse is his studie, he spends as much time to make himselfe slouenly, as the other to be spruse, his garters hang euer on the calues of his legs, his dublet vnbutton'd, and his points vntrust, his haire in's eyes like a drunkard, and his hat worne on his hinder part of his head, as if he car'd more for his memorie, than his wit: makes him looke as if he were distracted; Princox, I would haue you lie with me, I doe not loue to lie alone. Bould. With all my heart Madame. Wid. Are you cleane skind? Bould. Cleane skind Madame? there's a question, do you thinke I haue the itch? I am an English-woman, I protest, I scorne the motion. Wid. Nay prithee Princox be not angrie, it's a signe of honestie I can tell you. Bould. Faith Madam I thinke ti's but simple honestie that dwels at the signe of the scab. Wid. Well, well, come to bed, and wee'le talke further of all these matters. Exit. Bould. Fortune, I thanke thee, I will owe thee eies. For this good turne, now is shee mine indeede, Thou hast giuen me that successe my project hop'd Of, false disguise that hast beene true to me, And now be Bould, that thou mai'st welcome be. Exit. Enter Whoore-bang, Bots, Teare-chops, Spil-blovd and Dravver: seuerall patches on their faces. Tear. Dam-me, we will haue more wine, sirrha, or wee'l downe into the Seller, and drowne thee in a Butt of Malmesey, and hew all the Hogs-heads in peeces. Whoore. Hang him rogue, shall he die as honorably as the Duke of Clarence; by this flesh lets haue wine, or I will cut thy head off, haue it rosted and eaten in Pie-corner next Bartholmew-tide. Draw.

Spilb. The Watch? why you rogue, are not we Kings of Turne-bole? Draw. Yes marrie are yee, Sir, for my part, if you'l be quiet, ile haue a signe made of yee, and it shall be cal'd the foure Kings of Turne-bole. Bots. Will you fetch vs wine? Whoore. And a whoore (sirrah) Draw. Why what d'ee thinke of me, am I an Infidell, a Turke, a Pagan, a Sarazin, I haue beene at Besse Turnups, and she sweares all the Gentlewomen went to see a Play at the Fortune, and are not come in yet, and she beleeues they sup with the Players. Tear. Dam-me, we must kill all those rogues, we shall neuer keepe a whore honest for them. Bots. Goe your waies, sirrha, wee'l haue but a gallon a peice, and an ounce of Tobacco. Draw. I bessech you, let it be but pottles. Spilb. S'hart you rogue? Exit. Draw. Enter Wel-tri'd and Fee-simple. Whoore. Master Well-tri'd, welcome as my soule. Enter Dravver with Wine, Plate, and Tobacco. Bots. Noble Lad, how do'st thou? Spilb. As welcome, as the Tobacco and the Wine Boy. Tear. Dam-me thou art. Fees. Blesse mee (saue you Gent.) They haue not one face among 'em. I could wish my selfe well from them, I would I had put out something vpon my returne, I had as leue be at the Barmuthoes. Welt. Pray welcome this Gentleman. Spilb. Is he valiant? Welt. Faith hee's a little faulty that way: somewhat of a bashfull and backward nature, yet I haue brought him amongst you, because he hath a great desire to be flesh'd. Fees. Yes faith Sir, I haue a great desire to be flesh'd: now M r. Well-tri'd said, hee would bring mee to the onely flesh-mongers in the towne. Welt. Sir, he cannot endure the sight of steele. Whor.

Wel-tri'd, if they be not verie valiant or dare not fight, how come they by such Cuts and gashes, and such broken faces? Wel. Why their whores strike 'em with Cans, and glasses, and quart pots, if they haue nothing by 'em, they strike 'em with the Poxe, and you know that will lay ones nose as flat as a basket hilt Dagger.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus quarti ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Widdovv vndrest, a sword in her hand, and Bovld in his shirt, as started from bed. Wid. Vnciuill man, if I should take thy life, It were not to be weigh'd with thy attempt: Thou hast for euer lost mee. Bould. Maddam, why? Can loue beget losse? Doe I couet you Vnlawfully? Am I an vnfit man To make an husband of? Send for a Priest, First consummate the match, and then to bed Without more trouble. Wid. No, I will not doe't. Bould. Why you confest to mee as you'r Gentlewoman, I was the man your heart did most affect: That you did doate vpon my minde and body. Wid. So, by the sacred and inuiolate knot Of marriage, I doe, but will not wed thee. Bould. Why yet inioy me now. Consider Lady, That little, but blest time, I was in bed, Although I lay as by my sisters side, The world is apt to censure otherwise: So 'tis necessitie that wee marry now. Wid. Pish, I regard not (at a straw) the world: Fame from the tongues of men doth iniury Oftner then Iustice: and as conscience Onely makes guilty persons, not report: (For shew we cleare as springs vnto the world, If our owne knowledge doe not make vs so, That is no satisfaction to our selues,) So stand wee ne're so leprous to mens eye, It cannot hurt hart-knowne integritie. You haue trusted to that fond opinion, This is the way to haue a widdow-hood, By getting to her bed: Ahlas young man, Should'st thou thy selfe tell thy companions Thou hadst dishonour'd mee (as you men haue tongues Forked and venom'd 'gainst our subiect sexe) It should not moue me, that know 'tis not so: Therefore depart, Truth be my vertuous shield. Bould. Few widdowes would doe thus. Wid. All modest, would. Bould. To be in bed and in possession Euen of the marke I aim'd at, and goe off Foild and disgrac't, come, come, you'll laugh at me Behind my back, publish I wanted spirit, And mock me to the Ladies, call me childe, Say you denide me but to trie the heate And zeale of my affection toward you, Then clap't vp with a rime, as for example. Hee coldly loues, retires, for one vaine triall, For wee are yeelding, when we make deniall. Wid. Seruant I make no question, from this time You'll hold a more reuerent opinion Of some that weare long coates, and tis my pride, To assure you that there are amongst vs good: And with this continencie, if you goe away, I'le be so farre from thinking it defect, That I will hold you worthlest of men. Bould. S'hart, I am Tantalus, my long'd for fruit Bobs at my lips, yet still it shrinks from me. Haue not I that, which men say neuer failes To o'recome any? oportunitie? Come, come, I am too cold in my assault. By all the vertues, that yet euer were In man, or woman, I with reuerence Doe loue thee Ladie, but will be no foole To let occasion slip, her fore-top from me. Wid. You will faile this way to, vpon my knees I doe desire thee to preserue thy vertues, And with my teares my honor; t'is as bad To loose our worths to them, or to deceaue Who haue held worthy opinions of vs, As to betray trust: all this I implore For thine owne sake, not mine, as for my selfe, If thou bee'st violent, by this stupid night, And all the mischiefes her darke wombe hath bred, I'le raise the house, I'le crie a rape. Bo. I hope you will not hang me, that were murther Ladie, A greater sinne, then lying with me sure. Wid. Come, flatter not your selfe with argument, I will exclaime; the law hangs you, not I, Or if I did, I had rather farre confound The deerest bodie in the world to me, Then that, that bodie, should confound my soule. Bould. Your soule, ahlas Mistresse, are you so fond To thinke her generall destruction Can be procur'd by such a naturall act, Which beasts are borne to and haue priuiledge in? Fie, fiie, if this could be, farre happier Are sensitiue soules in their creation Than man the prince of creatures, thinke you Heauen Regards such mortall deeds, or punisheth Those acts, for which he hath ordained vs? Wid. You argue like an Atheist, man is neuer The prince of creatures, as you call him now, But in his reason, faile that, he is worse Than Horse, or Dog, or beasts of wildernesse, And t'is that reason teacheth vs to doe Our actions vnlike them: then that which you Termed in them a priuiledge beyond vs, The basenesse of their being doth expresse, Compar'd to ours, Horses, Buls, and Swine, Doe leape their Dams, because man does not so, Shall we conclude his making happilesse? Bould. You put me downe, yet will not put me downe, I am too gentle, some of you I haue heard, Loue not these words but force, to haue it done As they sing prick-song, e'ne at the first sight. Wid. Go too, keep off, by Heauen and Earth, i'le call else. Bould. How if no bodie heare you? Wid. If they doe not, I'le kill you with mine owne hand, neuer stare, Or failing that fall on this sword my selfe. Bould. Oh widdow wonderfull, if thou bee'st not honest. Now God forgiue my mother and my sisters. Thinke but how finely Madam vndiscouer'd For euer you and I, might liue all day your Gentlewoman To doe you seruice, but all night your man To doe you seruice, newnesse of the trick, If nothing else might stirre ye. Wid. T'is a stale one And was done in the Fleete ten yeares agoe, Will you begon? the doore is open for you. Bould. Let me but tarrie till the morning Madam, To send for clothes, shall I goe naked home. Wid. T'is best time now, it is but one a clock, And you may goe vnseene, I sweare by Heauen, I would spend all the night to sit and talke w'ee, If I durst trust you, I doe loue you so, My bloud forsakes my heart now you depart. Bould. S'hart, will you marrie me heereafter then? Wid. No, you are too yong, and I am much too old; I and vnworthy, and the world will say, We married not for loue, good morrow seruaut. Ex. Wid. Bould. Why so? these women are the erranst Iuglers in the World, the wry-leg'd fellow is an Asse to 'em. Well I Musique. must haue this wddow, what e're come on't: Faith she has turn'd me out of her seruice verie barely, harke, whats heere, musique. Enter Svbtle with a paper, and his Boy with a cloake. Subt. Rise Ladie Mistresse, rise: The night hath tedious beene, No sleepe hath fallen into my eies, Nor slambers made me sinne. Is not she a Saint then say, Thought of whom keepes sinne away? Rise Madame, rise and giue me light, Whom darkenesse still will couer, And ignorance darker than night, Till thou smile on thy louer; All want day till thy beautie rise, For the graie morne breakes from thine eies. Now sing it sirrha. [The Song sung by the Boy. Subt. S'foote, who's this? yong Master Bould? God saue you, you are an earely stirrer. Bould. You say true Master Subtle, I haue beene earely vp, but as God helpe me, I was neuer the neere. Subt. Where haue you beene Sir? Bould. What's that to you Sir? at a womans labour. Subt. Very good: I neare tooke you for a man Mid-wife before. Bould. The troth is, I haue beene vp all night at dice, &amp; lost my clothes, good morrow Master Subtle, pray God the Watch be broke vp: I thanke you for my Musique: Exit: Subt: Tis palpable by this aire, her husband being abroad, Bould has layen with her, and is now conuar'd out of doores. Is this the Ladie Perfect with a poxe? The truth is, her vertuous chastitie, began to make me make a myracle of her, still holding out to me, notwithstanding her husbands most barbarous vsage of her, but now indeede t'is no maruaile since another possesses her. Well Madame, Ile go finde out your Cuckold, ile be reueng'd on you and tell a tale Shall tickle him, this is a cheate in loue, Not to be borne, another to be guile Me of the game, I plaid for all this while. Exit. Enter Weltri'd, and Bovld puting on his doublet, Fee-simple on a bed, as in Bould's chamber. Welt. You see, we made bould with your lodging, indeed, I did assure my selfe, you were fast for this night. Bo. But how the Deuill came this foole in your companie? Welt. S'foote man, I carried him last night among the Rorers, to flesh him, and by this light he got drunke, and beate e'm all. Bould. Why then he can endure the fight of a drawne sword now? Welt. Oh God Sir, I thinke in my conscience, he will eate steele shortlie, I know not how his conuersion will hold after this sleepe, but in an houre or two (last night) he was growne such a little dam-me, that I protest, I was afraid of the spirit, that I my selfe had rais'd in him: but this other matter of your expulsion thus mads me to the heart; Were you in bed with her? Bould. In bed by Heauen. Welt. I'le be hang'd, if you were not busie to soone, you should haue let her slept first. Bould. Z'oones man, she put her hands to my breasts, and swore I was no maid, now I being eager to proue her words true, tooke that hint, and would violently haue thrust her hand lower, when her thought being swifter then my strength, made her no sooner imagine that she was betrai'd, but she leapes out of the bed, whips me downe a sword that hung by, and as, if fortitude and justice had met to assist her, spight of all argument faire or fowle she forc't me away. Welt. But is't possible thou should'st haue no more wit, would'st thou come away vpon any tearmes, but sure ones, hauing night, her chamber and her selfe naked in thine armes? By that light, if I had a sonne of 14 whom I had help't thus farre, that had seru'd me so, I would breech him. Bould. S'hart, what would you haue me done? Welt. Haue done? done, done twice at least. Bould. Haue plaid Tarquin and rauish't her. Welt. Pish, Tarquin was a block-head, if he had had any wit and could haue spoke, Lucrece had neuer been rauished, she would haue yeelded, I warrant thee, &amp; so wil any woman Bould. I was such an erronious heretique to loue, and women, as thou art, till now. Welt. God's pretious, it makes me mad, when I thinke on't: was there euer such an obsur'd trick? now will she abuse thee horriblie, say thou art a faint-hearted fellow, a milk-sop and I know not what, as indeede thou art. Bould. Z'oones, would you had beene in my place. Welt. Z'oones, I would I had, I would haue so jumbl'd her honestie: would'st thou be held out at staues end with words? dost not thou know a widdow's a weake vessell, and is easily cast if you close. Bould. Weltri'd, you deale vnfriendly. Welt. By this light I shal blush to be seen in thy companie. Bould. Pray leaue my chamber. Welt. Poxe vpon your chamber, I care not for your chamber, nor your selfe More than you care for me. Bo. S'blood I as little for you. Welt. Why fare you well. Bo. Why, fare-well you. Weltri'd, I prithee stay, Thou know'st I loue thee. Welt. S'hart, I loue you as well; but for my spleene, or choller I thinke, I haue as much as you. Bo. Well friend, this is the businesse you must doe for me, Repaire vnto the widdow, where giue out, To morrow morne, I shall be married, Inuite her to the wedding, I haue a trick, To put vpon this Lord to, whom I made My instrument to preferre me. Welt. What shall follow, I will not aske, because I meane to see't. The iars twixt friends, still keeps their friendship sweet. Ex. Feesi. Why Weltri'd, you rogue, whats that a vision? Bould. Why how now my Lord? who do you call rogue? the Gentleman you name is my friend, if you were wise I should be angrie. Feesi. Angrie with me? why dam me Sir, and you be; Cut with your sword, it is not with me I tell you As it was yesterday, I am flesht man, I. Haue you any thing to say to me? Bould. Nothing but this, how many doe you thinke, you haue slaine last night? Feesi. Why fiue, I neuer kill lesse. Bould. There was but foure: my Lord, you had best prouide your selfe and begon, three you haue slaine starke dead. Feesi. You jest. Bould. T'is most true, Weltri'd is fled. Feesi. Why let the Rorers meddle with me another time, as for flying, I scorne it, I kild 'em like a man; when did you euer see a Lord hang for any thing? we may kill whom we list, marry my conscience pricks me; ah plague a this drinke, what things it makes vs doe, I doe no more remember this now than a puppie-dogge. Oh bloodie Lord that art bedawb'd with gore, Vaine world adiew, for I will rore no more. Bould. Nay stay my Lord, I did but trie the tendernesse of your conscience, all this is nothing so, but to sweeten the tale (I haue for you) I foretold you this fain'd mischance. Feesi. Is it a tale belonging to the Widdow? Bould. I thinke you are a witch. Feesi. My grand-mother was suspected. Bould. The Widdow has desired you by me to meete her to morrow morning at Church in some vnknowne disguise, least any suspect it, for quoth she. Long hath he held me fast in his moist hand, Therefore I will be his in nuptiall band. Feesi. Bould, I haue euertaken you to be my friend, I am very wise now, and valiant, if this be not true, dam me Sir, you are the sonne of a whore, and you lie, and I will make it good with my sword. Bould. I am, what e're you please Sir, If it be not true, I will goe with you to the Church my selfe, your disguise I haue thought on; the Widdow is your owne. Come, leaue your fooling. Feesi. If this be true, thou little Boy, Bould. Cant. So true, as thou tel'st to me, To morrow morne when I haue the Widdow, My deare friend shalt thou be. Exeunt. Enter Maid like the foote-boy: Seldome with a couple of Serieants, Pits, Donner. Maid. Sir, t'is most true and in this shall you be vnlike to other Citizens that arrest To vndoe Gentlemen: your clemencie heere perchance saues two liues, one from the others sword, The other from the Lawes; this morne they fight, And though your debtor be a Lord, yet should he Miscarrie, certainely your debt were lost. Seld. Do'st thou serue the Lord Proudly? Maid. Sir, I do. Seld. Well, such a Boy as thou, is worth more money Then thy Lord owes me, t'is not for the debt I doe arrest him, but to end this strife, Which both may loose my money and his life. Enter Lord Provdly with a riding rod. Pr. My Horse there, Z'oones I would not for the world He should alight before me in the field, My name and honor were for euer lost. Seld. Good morrow to your Honor, I doe heare Your Lordship this faire morning is to fight, And for your honor: Did you neuer see The Play, where the fat Knight hight Old-castle, Did tell you truly what this honor was? Pr. Why, how now good man flat-cap, what d'ee lack? Who doe you talke to, sirrha? 1. Serg. We arrest you. Pr. Arrest me, rogue? I am a Lord ye curs, a Parliament man. 2. Serg. Sir, we arest you though. Pr. At whose suit? Seld. At mine, Sir. Pr. Why thou base rogue, did not I set thee vp, Hauing no stock, but thy faire shop and wife? Seld. Into my house with him. Maid. Away with him, away with him. Pr. A plot, a trick by Heauen. See Ingens foote-boy, t'is by his Masters meanes, oh coward, slaue; i'le put in baile, or pay the debt. Sel. I, I, I, wee'll talke with you withinâthrust him in. Ex. Enter Ingen looking on his sword and bending it, his brother like a Man. Ing. If I miscarrie Franck, I prithee see All my debts paid, about fiue hundred pounds Will fully satisfie all men, and my land And what I else possesse, by natures right And thy descent, Franck, I make freely thine. Broth. I know, you doe not thinke I wish you dead For all the benefit: besides, your spirit So opposite to counsaile, to auert Your resolution, that I saue my breath, Which would be lost in vaine, to expire and spend Vpon your foe if you fall vnder him. Ing. Franck, I protest you shall doe iniurie Vnto my foe, and much disturbance to Vnto my soule departing, die I heere Fairely, and on my single enemies sword, If you should not let him go off vntouch't. Now by the Master of thy life and mine, I loue thee Boy, beyond any example, As well as thou do'st me, but should I goe Thy second to the field, as thou dost mine, And if thine enemie kild thee like a man, I would desire, neuer to see him more, But he should beare himselfe off with those wounds He had receau'd from thee, for that time safe, And without persecution by the Law, For what hap is our foes, might be our owne, And no mans iudgement, sits in Iustice place, But weighing other mens as his owne case. Broth. He has the aduantage of you being a Lord, For should you kill him, you are sure to die, And by some Lawyer with a golden tongue, That cries for right, ten angels on his side; Your daring meete him, cal'd presumption: But kill he you, hee, and his noble friends Haue such a golden snaffle for the jawes Of man, deuouring Pithagorean Law, Thei'le reyne her stubborne chaps, e'ne to her taile: And though she haue yron teeth to meaner men, So master her, that who displeasd her most, She shall lie vnder like a tired jade, For small boates on rough seas are quickly lost, But ships ride safe, and cut what by they list. Ing. Follow what may, I am resolu'd deare Brother, This monster vallor, that doth feed on men, Groanes in me for my reputation. This charge I giue thee to, If I doe die, Neuer to part from the yong Boy, which late I entertain'd, but loue him for my sake: And for my Mistresse the Ladie Honor, Whom to deceiue, I haue deceiu'd my selfe. If she be dead, pray God I may giue vp My life a sacrifice on her, brothers sword; But if thou liu'st to see her gentle brother, If I be slaine, tell her I dy'de because I had transgrest against her worthy loue. This sword is not well mounted, lets see thine. Enter Maid like a foote-boy. Maid. Your staying Sir, is in vaine, for my Lord Proudly, Iust at his taking horse to meete you heere, At Seldomes suit the Citizen, was arrested Vpon an action of two hundred pounds, I saw it Sir, t'is true. Ing. Oh, scuruie Lord, It had beene a cleanlier shift then this to haue had It hinder'd by command, he being a Lord, But I will finde him. Enter Lord Provdly. Proud. You see, valiant Sir, I haue got loose Pro. stabs his sister. For all your stratagem, oh rogue are you there. Ing. Most ignoble Lord. Ingen stabs Proud. in the left arme. Proud. Coward thou did'st this That I might be disabled for the fight, Or that thou mightst haue some excuse to shun me, But t'is my left arme, thou hast lighted on. I haue no second; heere are three of you, If all doe murther me, your consciences Will more then hang you, damn you; come prepare. In. Brother walk off, &amp; take the boy away, is he hurt much? Bro. Nothing or very little. Fr. thrusts the Boy out. Ing. Ile bind your wound vp first, your losse of blood May sooner make you faint. Pr. Ingen, thou art a worthy Gentleman, for this curtesie, Go-too i'le saue thy life, come on Sir: hay, a passe or two. I'le cut your codpeice point Sir, with this thrust, And then downe goes your breeches. Ing. Your Lordships merrie passe. I had like to haue spoild your cut-worke band. Enter Maid like a foote-boy running, Brother after him, Maid kneeles betwixt'em. Maid. Oh Master, hold your hand, my Lord hold yours, Or let your swords meete in this wretched breast, Yet you are both well, what blood you haue lost Giue it as for the iniurie you did, and now be friends, Pr. S'hart, t'is a louing rogue. Ing. Kind Boy, stand vp, t'is for thy wound he bleeds, My wrong is yet vnsatisfied. Pr. Hence away it is a Sisters losse, that whets my sword. Mai. Oh stay, my Lord, behold your sister heere discouers her selfe. Bleeding by your hand Seruant see your mistresse Turn'd to thy seruant running by thy Horse, Whose means it was to haue preuented this, but all in vaine. Broth. Oh noble Ladie. Ing. Most worthie patterne of all women kind. Proud. Ingen, I am satisfied, put vp your sword. Sister, you must with me, I haue a husband The Lord Fee-simple's father, old, but rich: This Gentleman is no match for you; kneele not, That portion of yours, I haue consum'd, Thus marrying, you shall neuer come to want. Maid. Oh! sweet my Lord, my brother do not force me, To breake my faith or to a loathed bed. Ing. Force you, he shall not, brother beare her hence, Shee is my wife, and thou shalt finde my cause Ten times improu'd now. Pr. Oh, haue at you Sir. Ma. Hold, hold for heauens sake, was e're wretched Lady Put to this hazard? Sir, let me speake But one word with him, and i'le goe with you, And vndergoe, what euer you command. Proud. Doo't quickly, for I loue no whispering, T'is strange to see you Madame with a sword, You should haue come hither in your Ladies cloathes. Maid. Well, as you please my Lord, you are witnesse, whatsoe're before Hath past betwixt vs: thus I doe vndoe. Were not I mad, to thinke thou could'st loue me That would'st haue slain my Brother? Pr. Sai'st true sister. Ing. Oh thou faire creature! wilt thou be as false as other Ladies? Maid. Thou art my example, Ile kisse thee once, farewell for euer, come my Lord, now Match me, with whom you please, a tumbler. I must doe this, else had they fought againe. Pr.

Oh friend it would do me good at the heart To haue her ouercome, shee do's so brag And stand vpon her chastitie forsooth. Subt. Why then in plaine termes Sir, the fort is mine, Your wife has yeelded, vp-tailes is her song, The deed is done, come, now, be merrie man. Husb. Is the deed done indeed? come, come, you jest, Has my wife yeelded? is vptailes her song? Faith come, in prose, how got you to the matter first, ha. Pish, you are so bashfull now. Subt. Why, by my troth i'le tell you, because you are my friend, otherwise you must note it is a great hurt to the art of whooremasterie to discouer, besides the skill was neuer mine o'th price. Husb. Very good, on sir. Subt. At the first she was horrible stiffe against me, then Sir I tooke her by the hand, which I kiss'd. Husb. Good Sir. Subt. And I cal'd her pretie Rogue, and I thrust my finger betwixt her breasts, and I made lips; at last, I pul'd her by the chin to me, and I kist her. Husb. Hum, very good. Subt. So at the first, she kist very strangely, close, &amp; vntoward; then said I to her, thinke but vpon the wrongs, the intollerable wrong, the rogue your Husband does you. Hus. I that was very good, what said she to you then sir? Subt. Nay, I went on. First quoth I, thinke how he hath vs'd you, left you no meanes, giuen all your clothes to his Punckes, struck you, turn'd your gray eies into black ones, but yetâ Husb. A pretie conceit. Subt. Quoth I, these things are nothing in the Rascoll, thinke but what a base Whoore-master, the Rascoll is. Husb. Did you call me Rascoll so often are you sure. Subt. Yes, and oftner, for said I, none comes amisse to the rogue, I haue knowne him quoth I, do three lowzy beggars vnder hedges in the riding of ten mile, and I swore this to. Hus. Twas verie well, but you did lie. On I pray. Sub. Pish, one must lie a little, now sir by this time shee began to kisse some what more openly, and familiarlie, her resistance began to slacken, and my assault began to stiffen, the more her Bulwarke decai'd, the more my batterie fortified, at last sir, a little fumbling being past to make the Conquest more difficult, shee perceauing my readines mounted, fals me flat vpon her backe, cries mee out aloud Ahlas I yeeld vse me not roughly friend, My sort, that like Troy towne, ten yeares hath stood Beseig'd and shot at did remaine vnwon: But now tis conquer'd.

If with anie man, But prithee first consider with thy selfe If I should yeeld to thee, what a load thy Conscience Would beare about it, for I wish quick thunder May strike me, If I yet haue lost the truth, Or whitenesse of the hand I gaue in Church, And twill not be, thy happinesse (as thou thinkst) That thou alone should'st make a woman fall, That did resist all else, but to thy soule A bitter Corasiue, that thou didst staine, Vertue that else had stood immaculate, Nor speake I this, as yeelding vnto thee, For tis not in thy power, wert thou the sweet'st Of natures Children, and the happiest, To conquer me, nor in mineowne to yeeld, And thus it is with euery pious wife. Thy daylie railing at my absent Husband Makes me indure thee worse, for let him doe The most preposterous ill relishing things To me, they seeme good, since my Husband does 'em, Nor am I to reuenge or gouerne him, And thus it should be with all vertuous Wiues.

Wife. No, twill not be yet, thou iniurious man, How wilt thou right me in my Husbands thoughts, That on a false surmise, and spight hast tould, A tale to breed vncurable discontent? Bould was that ould wench that did serue the Widdow, and thinking by this way to gaine her loue Mist of his purpose, and was thus cashier'd, Nor cares shee to proclame it to the world. Su.

Where got you this cold my Lord? it can get in no where that I can see, but at your nostrels, or eies, all the other parts are so barricado'd with furre. Feesi.

T'is needlesse Master Bould, but I will doe Any thing you require to satisfie you, Why should you doubt, I will forbid the banes, For so your friend, heere tould me? I should rather Doubt that you will not matrie. Bo. Madam by heauen, as fully I am resolu'd to marry now, And will to, if you doe not hinder it, As euer louer was, only because The World has taken notice of some passage Twixt you and me, and then to satisfie My sweet heart heere, who poore soule is a feard, To haue some publike disgrace put vpon her, I doe require some small thing at your hands. Wid. Well, I will doe it, and this professe besides, Married, you shall as welcome be to mee As mine owne brother, and your selfe faire Ladie, Euen as my selfe, both to my boord, and bed. Wel.
