      <field name="fulltext">THE SIEGE OF ALEPPO. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable GEORGE HENRY EARL of LITCHFIELD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. The Reader will probably expect some Account of a Play which makes it's first Appearance in the World in this Manner.âHe is to know then, that The Siege of Aleppo having been refused by the Managers of both Theatres, to one of which, viz. Mr. Garrick, it was strongly recommended by Lady Caroline Burdet (who is thereby intitled to my present grateful Acknowlegements), would not have been offered to the Publick, had it not been honoured with the Approbation of several Persons of the first Note in the Republick of polite Literature, whom I am not at Liberty to mention.â I am obliged to declare this, in order to do common Justice to myself, and to obviate the Prejudices which might be conceived against a Performance that has not had the Credit and Advantage of a Theatrical Representation.âBut the Play must now speak for itself; of which I shall say no more than just to premise, that the Fable, and whole Construction of it, excepting the Reality of the Siege, is purely fictitious: That the Incidents were designed to be natural, tho' unexpected, not arising from common-place Exigencies, or forced Expedients, (which is too frequently the Case) but from the predominant Principles of the Characters themselves: And that for this Purpose I have endeavoured to give a new, and something of an original Cast to the principal Characters, particularly to those of Theodore, Sophronius, and Ormelia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. MEN. Manuel, Governour of Aleppo. Theodore, a Christian Chief. Othman, General of the Saracens. Sophronius, Son to Manuel. Leon, Friend to Sophronius. Romanus, Lieutenant to Theodore. Izrail, an Officer. Mervan, Secretary to the Governour. WOMEN. Ormelia, Daughter to Theodore. Eusebia, Daughter to Manuel. Officers, Soldiers, Attendants, &amp;c. SCENE Aleppo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE a Piazza. After several Shouts of To Arms, To Arms, &amp;c. Enter Sophronius and Leon meeting. Leon. Sophronius welcome! are our Messengers return'd from yonder Camp? Soph. Ev'n now, my Friend. Leon. I ask not the Success. Soph. Those Shouts may tell you: Our Overtures of Peace were all receiv'd With Scorn, and Pride peculiar to these Spoilers; They know no Stile but that of Conquerours, And in the Fullness of their Hearts declare, The Faithful never take, but give Conditions. Leon. Perhaps not yetâI pr'ythee, good Sophronius, What Terms do these victorious Vagrants offer? Soph. First, they invite us to embrace their Faith, And draw our Swords beneath the Prophets Banner, No more their Foes, but Brethren of the War. If wedded to our Errours, we reject This friendly Proposition, (such they call it) The next Alternative is briefly this, That we confess the Prowess of their Arms, By paying yearly Tribute to the Caliph. Leon. And it was this provok'd that glorious Uproar? Soph. The universal Voice is now for War: Soon as th'impatient Rabble caught the News, A Thousand Hearts were kindled in an Instant, And in the Wildness of new Zeal, to Arms, To Arms they cry'd, with such a clam'rous Shout As tore th'Expanse of Heav'n, and sure must strike Ev'n yon Barbarian Troops with sudden dread, Though long inur'd to Terrours. Leon. Thou hast warm'd me. These martial Transports promise well, Sophronius; Perhaps the wrath divine that long has scourg'd Our Follies, Vices, and corrupted Faith, With iron Rod of War, at length relents, Nor farther will permit this vile Imposture To make its Way with Death, and Desolation; And like a Deluge whelm the Eastern World. Soph. Alas, my Friend, we seem unfit for Mercy: The seeds of Jealousy are sown among us, And should they spread, and ripen to a Crop, Yon greedy Mussulmen will reap the Harvestâ Our Passions, Leon, fight for Mahometâ Union alone can save a sinking Land, And Concord is the strongest Nerve of War. Leon. Some distant Hints of this have reach'd mine Ear; 'Tis said, the baleful Breath of Whisperers Has undermin'd the Worth of Theodore, And shook his Credit with your Father Manuel: Are these Suggestions true? Soph. Too trueâMy Father, Whose Piety, and ev'n paternal Care, Still anxious for the Welfare of his People, Raises him high in all Affections, Has yet the Leav'n of Old-Age within him: (With Rev'rence let me speak in his Dispraise) Leon, that Sigh declares too well thou seest His eager Warmth, his Frowardness of Temper Impatient of Controul, and fixt as Death In all Resolvesâto this, Credulity Too oft unlocks his Ear, and gives Access To a well-garnish'd Tale. Leon. Proceed. Soph. Thou know'st, Some Moons have shed their Beams since Theodore Lodg'd in our Town his hardy Band of Syrians, A voluntary Aid:âThe Saracens Were then upon their March; and Manuel gave The Honours of our chief Command to him. Train'd from his active Youth a Son of War, He is no nice Observer of the Forms, The ceremonious Def'rence, and the Duties Preeminence expects from all beneath her. The desp'rate Fight that Yesterday he push'd, Unauthoris'd by Manuel, some dark Foe Has swell'd into a dang'rous Crime of State. Leon. It looks not wellâthe gallant Theodore, No Doubt, has noble Worthâsure, that Presumption Was but th'Effect of Valour's Confidenceâ Yet, I have lately noted, our Aleppians Like not the headstrong Fierceness of his Nature, That wants more Tincture of Humanity: Necessity, they say, unsheath'd the Sword, But hot-brain'd Theodore enjoys their Dangers, And revels savage in a Field of Blood. Soph. Trueâbut a Breach might be pernicious now:â And yet Sophronius has another Fearâ Leon, how frail at best is mortal Man, This Compound of Divinity and Passion? For oh! believe me, midst this gen'ral Horrour, While War with hideous Strides stalks round our Walls, Legions of Evils gathering in his Train, My Weakness robs my Country of my Thoughts, And half my Breast admits a private Care. Leon. Alas! I know that CareâYou woo Ormelia, The Daughter of the valiant Theodoreâ His other Joy, and what he loves next War. Soph. Ay, Friend, for should this Cloud of Discontent Once gather to a Storm, will it not blast Our growing Spring of Love? Love did I say? 'Tis true my secret Suit seem'd not ungrateful; But know that glorious Maid adores her Father; Nor marvel, she's the Daughter of his Soul; His Spirit, Fierceness, and his Pride of Virtue, All glow within her Breast, refin'd and cast Into a softer MouldâHence spring my Fears. Leon. There is Resemblance in our Lots, Sophronius; Thou know'st thy gentle Sister, fair Eusebia, Smiles on my honest PassionâYet thy Father Vows he will never sanctify her Choiceâ 'Tis true, my ruin'd Fortunesâ Soph. Pr'ythee Peace; Thy Birth is noble, and thy Virtue godlike; These give thee ample Title to Eusebia: O could I call thee Brotherâsoothing Wishâ And yet thou'rt more alreadyâThou'rt my Friend. [Embrace. Wait we the Will supreme!âbut seeâmy Sister. Enter Eusebia. Eus. Brother, the Chiefs are summon'd all to Council. I heard Enquiry made for you, and Leon. Soph. I shall attend themâLeon, you will follow. [Exit Sophronius. Leon. Let me first pay more pleasing Duty here. Why sighs my Fair? Our Hearts are sure our own: Those Manuel cannot partâOh! why that Tear? I know it falls for Leonâcruel Fortune! Why was I born to spoil Eusebia's Peace? Eus. I fear we have indulg'd our Loves too farâ As Children venture in a Calm to Sea, Regardless of the Cloud slow-sweeping cross The Vault of Heav'n, and big with future Ruin. Leon. Yet let us not despairâHeav'n oft afflicts For Trial, not DestructionâTime may come, When my Heart's Truth, my Service in the War, And all the virtuous Labours of a Life Devoted to my Country, and to thee, Will melt thy Father's Soul; then shall he bless My Toils, and overpay me with thy Beauties. Eus. Could he but view thee with Eusebia's Eyesâ Yet something whispers me, we'ave done amiss; Why was our Love first made a Mystery? Why cover'd from the Day, and from my Father? Who gave me right to fix my Heart on thee? 'Twas Folly, if not worseâand Manuel's Anger Perhaps is providentialâfor till now His Fondness still prevented my Desires. Leon. That Fondness was but Humourâwhile he pleas'd Thy tender Age, he but indulg'd himself; Thou never hadst a Boon to ask till nowâ Eus. Hah! Leon, have a Care; I love thy Virtue;â That rais'd, and that must justify my Passion; Urge not a Thought to shake my filial Dutyâ I always held the Name of Father sacred. Leon. This Rigour, which I know not how to blame, May crush the Hope that yet supports my Being: I tremble while I speakâperhaps, thy Father Means to compel thy Virgin Heartâif soâ Where will thy Duty be, or where thy Love? Eus. Those Fears are vainâI cannot love another; Virtue itself forbids it, and my Heart Flutters, and tells me 'tis impossible. My Vows are thine, (oh! spare a Maiden's Blushes) My ev'ry Joy, my ev'ry Care is thineâ Leon. O! how shall I requite this wond'rous Goodness? Eus. Once more I will essay my Father's Temperâ If he relentsâ'tis all the Happiness I wish on Earthâif notâsupport me Heav'n. Leon. He must, he mustâor Pity's fled from Man: Who could behold unmov'd such weeping Beauty? Thou fairer than the Morning's cloudless Dawn, Thou sweeter than the vernal Bloom that decksâ Eus. AwayâI am a Woman, and a Christian; Cease then these Strains of ordinary Lovers, That wound our Reason, while they sooth our Pride. Nor suits thy Fondness with these Times of Danger; Courtship and Dalliance are mere Treason now; Thy Country calls theeâ Leon. I obey the Call. Yet Beauty is the just Reward of Valour. Eus. But should not be its Hindranceâ Leon. Matchless Wisdom! There is no longer Merit in those Eyes! But soft, who comes this Way? Let me conduct thee. Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter Romanus. Rom. If I see right, Aleppo thou art mineâ If mine, I yield thee to the Saracensâ While Modes of foolish Faith divide the World, And swarms of hungry Bigots cling to each, I turn Opinion to Convenienceâ For this I've sometime sworn to Mahomet; And his Religion pays its Vot'ries well. Mervan I've laden full with pois'nous Matter, Which, when infus'd into old Manuel's Ear, Will swell his peevish Humour, till it burst Its Venom on the fiery Theodore; My Friend, my Patron, andâmy destin'd Tool. Rage, Taunts, Reproaches, Discord, Broils ensue; And Ruin sure is made of such Materials. Off then Dependance!âThou art burthensome; A Soul like mine disdains to live on Alms. 'Tis wellâAnd shall I pine with fond Desire? I love Ormelia stillâas Nature promptsâ Sophronius loves her too;âshe slights my Vows For the pert Lispings of that down-cheek'd Boy; Should thisâbut holdâthe Secretary's here. Enter Mervan. Mer. What deep in Thought, Lieutenant? clear thy Brow; Perhaps the wish'd-for Hour of Vengeance comes, To clip the tow'ring Wing of Theodore. Rom. Give me thy Hand, my Mervan, my best Friend, My Soul's true CounterpartâI knew the Bus'ness Would thrive beneath thy WisdomâPr'ythee tell me, How did the shallow Manuel take thy Tale? Mer. You'd laugh to see the old Man chafe, Romanus; Sound but the Name of Theodore, he frets Like a gall'd Jade; he blames his sightless Folly, That ne'er discern'd how much th'officious Zeal Of Yesterday, which cost us so much Blood, Is puft with Pride, and scorns to own a Master. Rom. Well saidâMy Soul foresees much good from this. Mer. Soon as I found that Prejudice take Root, I scatter'd Hints, as was agreed between us, That Theodore in Letters to our Emp'rour, Had oft complain'd of Manuel's Government, And thrown much Blame upon his wayward Age. Rom. I hope you touch'd that Point but tenderly; It surely was a Task for all thy Skill. Mer. Do I not practise Cunning under thee? I spoke it not, my Friend, as fit Foundation To raise a certain Proof upon, but what Prudent Suspicion guess'd; and therefore wish'd him Henceforth in Judgment to compare this Notice With Theodore's Demeanour. Rom. Thanks, good Mervan: Why what a ready Instrument is Manuel For Knavery to work withal? Merv. Why Knavery? We mean no Ill to him, or to our Countryâ But, Sir, my Wrongs cry loudly for Revengeâ I've been abus'd by TheodoreâBecause I deal not in his boist'rous Trade of War, He deems me but a Beast that will be tame, And patient of his BurthenâCurses on himâ Sure I can feel a Smart as well as he, And Vengeance has more Shapes than one, Romanus. Rom. Which he shall prove: Shortly I hope to see This fierce, this blust'ring, this all-conqu'ring Hero, That has refus'd us both his bauble Daughter, With vile Contempt, with Insolence refus'd her, Hurl'd from his airy Pinacle of Pride, Turn'd from his Post, disgrac'd, mark'd for a Traitor, And hooted, like a Nusance, through Aleppo. Mer. Let me but see that Day, my Soul's at Ease. Rom. So is not mineâThou know'st not Half my Purpose, [Aside. Then when the pinching Shame shall gripe him close, And more than Madness festers at his Heart, If thou should'st humbly ask him for his Daughter, Let him contract his angry Brow, and tell thee, He scorns Alliance with a paltry Scribe. Mer. It was his very Answer to my Suit. Rom. I found a like Repulseâat least 'tis fit You think so [Aside]âYet, believe me, my Resentments Burn not so strongly for myself, as thee: Mine is a common DestinyâIt seems, We petty Men of War are Slaves by Office. Mer. But not by Nature. Rom. Thou art right, my Mervan; And therefore to our Work. Is it not better, Thus wisely to employ our active Pow'rs, And set the secret Springs of Mischief going, Than to bedew our Beards with childish Tears, And whimper in a Corner for a Toy? Mer. Romanus, I must ever thank thy Goodness, That saw me drooping with unmanly Sorrow, Taught me Revenge, and wean'd me from my Follies. Rom. Thy Firmness charms meâPr'ythee, honest Mervan, When does the Council sit? Mer. I guess 'ere now. Rom. Then let us henceâthis Morning may afford Some kind Event, to bless our utmost Wishes. [Ex. SCENE III. The back Scene opens and discovers the Council sitting. Manuel, Theodore, Sophronius, Izrail, Leon, and other Officers in Council. Man. Indeed, the Progress of their Arms is wond'rous; How has their hungry War devour'd our Land, And, like the dreadful Rage of Pestilence, Left a sad Track of Ruin in its Course? Whole Provinces are bent beneath the Yoke, And Syria's better Half is Ababeker's. Soph. Yet may we hope, my Chiefs, to save the other; Our Men are high in Blood, and hot for Action; Thanks to the Foe for this: Nay all Aleppo Breathes one heroic Ardour; bending Age Girds on his palsied Side the weighty Sword, Brides chace their youthful Husbands from their Arms, And Mothers trim their darling Sons to Battle. O! for a Tempest's Blast to drive this Flame, Till it consume yon Vermin Tribes, like Stubble! The. Well hast thou spoke, Sophronius: Wherefore then Sit we thus idle and inactive here, While Boys and Women chide our tardy Councils? Who dreams again of Peace, I hold him Coward: We'll plead once more our Cause in yonder Field, And wear our Reasons on our Weapon's Points. Up then, and let us issue to the Plain. Man. Why all this Blaze of Words? Are we not met To lay the Plan of War, and well consult How we may best annoy the haughty Foe? Mean while I hold it meet to tell thee, Theodore, It ill becomes the Man, that Yesterday Lavish'd away so many Christian Lives In his o'er-fev'rish Zeal, to dictate now To Men of cooler Heads, and sounder Judgments. The. Hah! what did Manuel say?âBy allâ Iz. Nay hold; For this may go too far. Man. Izrail, take Heed; His Spleen may choke him else. The. Now in the Name Of Honour, and of Arms, what means this Treatment? Am I reproach'd because I would have led Thy dastard Troops the nearest Way to Fame, And taught them how to snatch a noble Conquest? Glory's the Soldier's Mistress; to be woo'd, Where Death has planted all his Terrours round her, Or never to be wonâHad thy Aleppians Kept firm their Ranks, yon Camp had smoak'd to Heav'nâ But, Sir, they poorly shrunk before the Foe, And let in Numbers like a Flood upon themâ I hate these puny, half-bred Sons of Mars, That cooly stalk to fight on even Terms, But bid them grapple with unequal Fortune, They stand aloof, and snarl like Curs at Distance. Man. Mervan, thy Fears were justâI'll try him further. [Aside. Say'st thou, our Troops gave Way? I will presume To think, they might dislike so blind a Leader: So, Sir, retrench the License of thy Tongue; Success had never justify'd an Action That wanted the due Sanction of our Will. Soph. In what, my Leon, will this Discord end? [Aside to Leon. The. And have I liv'd to this? To bandy Words, To fight a bloodless Quarrel?âPatience, Heav'n! Thy Will! Had I a Thought to waste on thee, While I was busied on a bold Design, Big as my Soul could grasp?âWas that a Time, For Forms precise, or Speech quaint-worded thus, Most worthy Sir, with your good Worship's Leave, I'll cut yon Villain's Throat? A Soldier's Valour O'erleaps the narrow Bounds of courtly Rules, Fit for your supple, ceremonious Slave, That dares not look askant but by Commission. Man. I'll not endure this LanguageâFrom this Day, I warn thee, know me for Commander here. Iz. Yet be advis'd, good Theodore. The. Stand offâ Shall I be lesson'd by a Dotard thus, Pride-bloated with the Pageantry of Pow'r? Be thou Commander here, but not of me; I have no Master but the good Heracleus. Is not my Service free? What brought me hither? Not thy Command, but glorious Thirst of Honour, And Zeal high-beating in my Country's Cause. I came thy Friend, not Vassal; and as such Was first receiv'd by this ungrateful City: Hast thou forgot, old Manuel, with what Shouts Of gen'ral Joy, what thund'ring Peals of Transport, Thy vile Aleppians welcom'd my Arrival, And hail'd me like the Genius of the Land? Man. No moreâI hold not Conf'rence with a Traitorâ Know henceforth I renounce thy vaunted Friendship, And from this Moment ceases thy Command. We want no Stranger, Sir, to fight our Battles: My Son, the Charge of our Aleppian Troops We do commit to thee; for thou hast won The Soldiers Heart: They'll follow thee to conquest, And full Success shall prove my Choice was just. Soph. Worse than my Fears [Aside]. O! would my honour'd Father Weigh but th'Importance of this Mighty Trust With my green Years, and yet untaughtâ Man. Away; Am I not Ruler here, at least of thee? Let not Sophronius cross his Father's Purpose. The. 'Tis wond'rous wellâO ye immortal Spirits Of my brave Ancestors, whose laurell'd Deeds Have swell'd the golden Trumpet of loud Fame, And rank'd you with the CÃ¦sars of the World, Was it for this I taught my Soul to pant For high Renown, and burn with all your Fires, To be supplanted by a silken Stripling, A Boy, that trembles if his Finger bleeds? O! Blot accurst upon the Name of Soldier. Soph. Sir, I well know your Merit, and admire it; I own thee first in Arms, and shall be proud To emulate thy Valour in the Fight. Yet let not warlike Theodore esteem My Virtue of so small, so mean a Size, But I shall nobly labour to maintain The Character I sought not for, and sweat, Boy as I am, to reap my Share of Glory. Man. Spoke like the Son I love. The. It is enough: Joy to the Gen'ral; to Aleppo Joy: The giddy Crew will well approve this Change: Perhaps the Saracens may thank you too: That as it may; I leave you to your Fortune; To-morrow's early Dawn shall light me home: And mark me, Manuel, by my Wrongs, I swear, Should this proud City (which methinks I see Ready to take her fatal Turn of Ruin) Hereafter court my Aid with Tears of Blood, I'd give her up to her deserv'd Destruction. And know, the Word of Theodore is Fate. [Exit Theodore. Man. In what a Heat departs this noisy Chief? I hope none present disapprove my Deed. Iz. You could no lessâHis Pride demanded it. Man. Think we no more of himâHaste thee, Sophronius, To the glad Troops; prepare them for Engagement; For thou shalt sally forth before yon Sun Has dipp'd his Beams in Oceanârouse their Souls To Christian Fortitude; remember them, Life, Liberty, Religion, call to Arms. Thou Pow'r supreme, (if yet we may presume Thy righteous Vengeance has not fix'd our Doom) Relenting, O! behold this wretched Land, And guide our Battle with thy mighty Hand; Thy injur'd Truth to Infidels make known, And vindicate a Cause so much thy own. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Gallery in Theodore's House. Enter Romanus. Romanus. At length the Toils are setâand Theodore, If I can catch so huge a Beast as thee, It will be Sport indeedâsee where he comes, And in the sullen Mood I wish'd to fix himâ Enter Theodore. The. Who's there, Romanus? Rom. Ay, Lord General. The. I pr'ythee do not mock me. Rom. By my Soul, You yet are so to me. The. Then thou art honest; Most Friends, like Insects, live but in the Sun, And now thou seest the Winter of my Glory. Rom. Come, Sir, can Fools, or Knaves dishonour Virtue? Her native Splendour knows not Diminution, Nor Titles are Additions to her Fame. So take your Grievance as a Soldier should do; Work up a noble Tumult in your Breast, And meditate the Fullness of Revenge. O! had you seen a Sight that crost my Eyesâ The. What hast thou seen?âmethinks I burn to hear thee. Rom. You, Sir, yourself, my Godlike Theodore, In villainous Effigies hoisted up On a high Pole, and born along the Streets By the licentious Rabble; one attir'd In antick Garb, the lewdest of the Tribe, With solemn Pace headed this Pageantry; And ever and anon the saucy Crew, With Bonnets off in mock Obeisance, cried, All Hail, Lord Gen'ral, Hail, great Theodore!â While the wise Citizens, still fond of Change, Blest the Conceit, and grinn'd their Approbation.â I met the vile Procession, and although Prudence had lock'd the Organ of my Speech, Sure they must see a Lion in my Eyes. The. Ungrateful, senseless, and inhuman Villains! What! have I fac'd the Rage of Seasons round, The Dogstar's Beam, and Winter's frozen Shafts; Renounc'd the soft Delights of balmy Peace, And dash'd the honey'd Cup of Pleasure from me; Have I made Things most terrible to Sense, Sweet to my Soul, as Sleep to weary Labour; To be repaid at length with publick Scorn, To be the Sport of Garbage?âCursed Day! Thy Tale has call'd my Spirits up in Arms, And all within me pants for vast Revenge. Rom. Why that was bravely said. The. Yet my Romanus, What need I thus indulge superfluous Rage? Sure I may safely leave my Cause to Heav'nâ The Saracen will soon avenge my Quarrel, And this fam'd City, laid in burning Ruin, Or bow'd to Slav'ry, ease my tortur'd Soul.â Inform yon Army by a Syrian Trumpet, That Theodore draws off his Pow'r in Peace, Nor longer will obstruct their rapid War. To-morrow march we homewards. Rom. How my Lord? What! quit the Theatre of this great World, And leave a Part unfinish'd? there remain, Or I mistake, more Scenes to bustle in: And therefore my plain Honesty of Love, Would turn this idle Current of your Thoughts. The. What wouldst suggest? Rom. Why, ay, it must be thusâ [Half aside. And so I see my Patron full reveng'd, And lifted to a higher Sphere of Glory. The. Revenge, and GloryâMusick to my Ears! What wouldst thou say? something is lab'ring in thee, And I well know thy Pregnancy of Brain. Rom. But then the MeansâNay, these Necessity Will warrant ev'n to Casuistryâmy Lordâ The. My Lord! What is't thou mutter'st to thyself, That startles Expectation?âIf thou lov'st me, Give me thy Soul at large. Rom. I will; attend. When lately Captive in yon hostile Camp One Ev'ning I stood musing by myself, Othman, the Leader of the Caliph's Armies, Accosted me with many gentle Terms, And proffer'd me his Friendshipâit amaz'd me. The. As well it mightâ Rom. At length, my Lord, he strove With all the well-turn'd Rhet'rick he could urge, To win me to the Law of Mahomet; But when he found my Faith was Mountain strong, He next attack'd me in my Honesty; âIf by your Means, he cry'd, we could surprize âThis stubborn City in the Dead of Night, âOld Manuel shall resign the Chair of State, âAnd the whole Government devolve on you.â And so I trust my Politicks it shall. [Aside. Why what a Bribe was that? The. Which you abhorr'd! Rom. Most surely; for in me a Deed like this Were Fraud, and Treason;âif atchiev'd by you, It would be glorious Justice. The. Do I hear thee? Is this the Vengeance Theodore should take? Is this the Glory thou wouldst blot my Fame with? Perdition on thee for so foul a Thought. Rom. Nay but 'tis strangeâhow this your Passion shakes you! You startle at the Outside of a Bus'ness, Which I confess not specious, nor discern The honest Drift of this. The. Honest! thou ly'stâ It savours all of Infamy, and Horrourâ Rom. Sir, you mistake me muchâYou well may put My Meaning into utmost Execution, And yet hold Mahomet in stern Defiance. The. As how? Impossible! still more mysterious. Rom. Say, Sir, I see you govern in Aleppo Upon the Terms propos'd; first, there ends Manuel: Next, these bold Slaves are humbled to your Mercy; And at fit Time, my Lord, you shall throw off The Yoke of Vassallage, once more assert The prostrate Christian Cause, and purge your Country By your Herculean Sword, of a curs'd Foe That long has torn her Vitals. The. Hah! why this Hath Aspect plausible, and asks a Thought. Rom. And thus the Empire shall be one Day freed, And only Mahomet, and Manuel cheated. Does not Fame hang to this? The. No, I've resolv'd; I never travell'd the By-paths of Glory; What! turn Dissembler, practise in the Dark? It is beneath me; I ne'er did a Deed But Daylight was the Voucher; Friend, or Foe, Let the great Soul of Theodore be open. Rom. I've doneâI own with me 'tis Daintiness To weigh my Deeds by Scruples, when the End Is noble, and well pays meâthis same Trouble Your Goodness will excuseâI meant it wellâ The. Ay, and I thank thy Love. Rom. As 'tis, methinks, 'Twere better ev'n be reconcil'd to Manuel. The. Never, oh! never. I would risque my Fame Sooner on thy Device. Rom. Nay, my good Lord, There is yet one Way, only one Way left To set these Matters right. The. Name it, quick name it. Rom. Alliances, some say, best heal Divisionsâ The gay Sophronius, our Aleppian Gen'ral, Looks with a Lover's Eye on fair Ormeliaâ The. Pr'ythee no moreâunite Antipathies! Perish my Name before I see it link'd To Manuel's HouseâWhere is this Daughter mine? If she can lend an Earâ Rom. My gracious Lord, Your Daughter comes this WayâHe's moveableâ Romanus, thou shalt bend him to thy Purposeâ Thou hast more Wiles to tryâ [Aside. Enter Ormelia. Orm. Alas! my Father, You seem disturb'd; may I not ask the Cause? The. Manuel, Sophronius, and it may be, Thou. Orm. Hah! how have they, or how have I displeas'd thee? Tell me, I pray, Romanus, what has hap'd? For there's a Fierceness on my Father's Brow, My Eyes would not encounter. Rom. Briefly, Madam, Old Manuel, in his Peevishness of Rage, Has just dismist your Father from his Post, And now Sophronius heads th'Aleppian Troops, That are this Instant marshall'd for the Battle. Orm. Is't so? Yield then fond Love, my Virgin Heart, And nobler Passions warm me; from this Hour, Sophronius be an Alien to my Soul. Sir, that I listen'd to his soft Address, (For sweetly sure he breath'd his am'rous Tale) Thus on my Knee let me bespeak Forgiveness; And be great Theodore assur'd of this, His Daughter knows to scorn th'aspiring Youth, That dares usurp her injur'd Father's Honour. Rom. So, there's a dang'rous Rival well dislodg'd; Sophronius gone may make good Room for me. [Aside. The. Why that's my ChildâI did thee Wrong to doubt theeâ Thou hast been ever jealous of my Glory, And with the Softness of thy Sex hast blended The most exalted Sentiments, well worthy The gallant Line of Heroes thy Forefathers. Orm. I would not shame my Raceâyou taught me betterâ The. Heav'n had some Pity left, and gave me thee, In Recompence for thy dear Mother's Loss, (Two Stars are not more like than she and thou) And the vast Weight of my still growing Care. âI will retire awhileâO my Ormelia, I have a thousand Thoughts to combat with, And each by Turns directs my wav'ring Purpose. Exit. Theodore. Rom. Now to my Lover's Cue. [Aside] Illustrious Maid, How would those shining Beauties bless the Man, Thrice happy Man, that could deserve thy Love? Orm. If thou would'st merit my Esteem, Romanus, Talk not of Love to meâI have renounc'd Thy SexâIt shall not henceforth be in Man To cost my Heart a Sigh. Rom. Say not so, Lady: O wherefore must a faithful Lover suffer, For the rash Crime of one presumptuous Wretch? I know the Man (could you but see his Pangs) That takes his Being from Ormelia's Eyes; That loves her with so bright, so pure a Flame, It is almost the Fervour of Devotion. Ah why should such a Man despair for ever? Orm. Thou would'st describe thyselfâmust I again Warn thee desist from thy ungrateful Suit, And pester me no more with nauseous Love? Rom. Desist! ImpossibleâThy Charms forbid itâ Thou hast a nat'ral Right to be admir'd, And our Heart's Homage is Ormelia's Due. Firm Perseverance is the Life of Virtue, The Mark of Bravery, the Stamp of Heroes; It bears us through the roughest Storms of Fortune, And is the Gale that wafts us up to Heav'n. Is it a Crime then only when we love? Orm. If not a Crime, at least it is a Follyâ Think not, fond Youth, to snare my easy Heart With the romantic Topicks of stale Courtship, Such as you practise to yourselves at home. âYour Doctrine isâAll Women may be won; She that once lov'd still hugs the fond Idea, And, tender Maid, sighs for a second Wooer. Hast thou then harbour'd such coarse Thoughts of me? Away, and learn to know Ormelia better. Rom. In truth, I own I had. [Aside] You wrong me, Madam: If Passion most refin'd, ifâ Orm. Cease, be silent, Or Theodore shall know thy Insolence. Rom. Alas! I own the Weakness of my Claim In the World's gen'ral VerdictâI was born Your Father's CreatureâYet I stand indebted Less to his Bounty, than his bright Exampleâ He taught my youthful Breast to beat for Glory, And stor'd it well with Virtues all his ownâ âHere rest my Hopesâwith these I woo Ormeliaâ Nor need I prove the Greatness of my Soul, When I aspire to theeâO would my Fair Look gently on my Pain, her Father's Will Would soonâ Orm. No more; thou hast abus'd his Friendship; Retire, or be assur'd this Rudeness, Sirâ Rom. Must then my virtuous Loveâ Orm. Away; be gone.â Rom. Farewel, too cruel MaidâInsolent Devil; But I may lower this high Strain of yours. [Aside, and Exit. Orm. This Fool could not have urg'd in a worse Time His most vexatious Suitâforget Sophronius! Have I not set my Heart a painful Task? Ay; but remember who thou art, Ormelia, And shame thy feeble SexâYet, say he loves me, As (if the Eye be Window to the Soul) I've seen he does most deeply, may he not Forego this fatal Honour?âthere's my Refuge; 'Tis not too lateâhe's hereâassist me Heav'n This dreadful Hourâhis Conduct must resolve meâ I will not seem acquainted with the Change. Enter Sophronius. Welcome Sophronius; did you meet your Rival? E'en now the bold Romanus parted hence. Soph. That he admires where I do, can I blame him? Sure, all that know thy Beauties are my Rivals: But, till I see the Man that loves Ormelia, With Passion more unfeign'd, more true than mine, Why should I doubt my Right to her Regard?â I fear she knows not what has chanc'd to-day: Perplexing Thought! [Aside. Orm. Well, I will own, Sophronius, As far as Woman's Modesty will warrant, Thy Truth has won an Int'rest in my Heart: And I can look with cool Indifference On all Mankind but thee. Soph. Heart-bursting Rapture! It is too great for Wordsâthus let me thank theeâ [Embraces her. And now I can reveal with less Regret, Th'unpleasing News thou yet art Stranger to. Orm. What News, what means Sophronius? Soph. O my Life, But that I find me rooted in thy Breast, This Morning saw a sudden Turn of Things, That might have marr'd my rising Hopes for everâ Orm. I understand you not. Soph. Yet witness Heav'n, How much it griev'd me to beholdâ Orm. Hah! what! O speak, and ease my frighted Apprehension! Soph. Know then, there is a Breach between our Fathers: It matters not to tell th'unhappy Ground Of this Contention; but th'Effect was this, That Theodore commands no longer here. Orm. Then, Sir, the Life of Battle is expiring. 'Tis well thou'rt not to answer for the Follies Of thy old doting SireâYet let me spare himâ And rather, tell me what great Son of Fame, What Thunderbolt of War was nam'd to head The Troops, my Father is not fit to lead? Soph. There lies the Circumstance that gives me Painâ For that unwelcome Honour fell to me. Orm. To thee?â'tis wellâI joy at least in thatâ Soph. Dost thou?âthou Excellence! trust me, my Love, I never wish'd to bear this Load of Glory. Orm. I do believe theeâtherefore my Sophronius Will eagerly resign a painful Post, Ill-suited to his unexperienc'd Youth. Soph. Confusion! what did my Ormelia say? Orm. What Reason, Justice, Duty, Nature prompts; Hence to old Manuelâflyâstrive to prevent The Ruin will ensueâurge him restore My Father to his Honoursâbid him do it, In Pity to Himself, his Friends, his Countryâ Soph. I might as well preach Silence to the Windsâ Orm. Why then, at least do thou renounce this Charge, And let some mean, ungen'rous, upstart Wretch Swell in the Plumage of this ill-got Glory. Soph. Impossible, romantic! Orm. How Sophronius? Soph. Thou can'st not say thou lov'st me, and ask thisâ Orm. Thou can'st not say thou lov'st me, and refuse itâ Soph. Refuse! Is there a Boon I must refuse thee This only one there isâO my Ormelia, Abate me this, and thy Commands are Favours, Thy Bidding sacred, and thy dear Requests My Motives to all ActionâO remember, The nice Demands, the Tenderness of Honourâ It was my Duty to decline this Station; Once mine, it is my Duty to maintain it. I cannot quit my ChargeâHonour forbids; 'Tis the first Dictate of my Soulâ'tis what, Thank Heav'n, I feel, I love e'en more than thee. Orm. My Lord, I needed not thy great Example; Know too I hold the Honour of my House Dearer than thee, and all thy Race. Vain Youth, I see thy Pride; see, and despise it tooâ My Heart mistook theeâI revoke my Loveâ Go, trifle with some easy, silly Maid; Some tender-hearted Nymph, some dove-like Dame; Make her the Fondling of thy leisure Hours; But know, Ormelia, spite of all thy Sex, Will love, or hate, as Reason shall direct. Soph. Thy Censure's too severe; it may be Pride, But 'tis an honest Pride that moves me nowâ I would be true to Honour, and to thee. Orm. No more;âthou dost partake of Manuel's Guilt; And him, and thee I deem my Father's Foe. Soph. I am thy Father's Successour, not Foe: Say, Theodore, or Manuel be to blame, Sophronius still is innocent, and pleads Th'untainted Merit of sincerest Love. Orm. Love! dost thou talk of Love? Hence to thy Chargeâ Hark, how yon Trumpet calls you to the Field; [Trumpet sounds. What! are the Soldiers waiting for their Gen'ral, And shall a peevish Girl detain him here? Leader, farewel; mount the steep Cliff of Glory; Reach with an Eagle's Wing her topmost Height; There, while thou baskest in thy Eminence, Remember this my sole, my last Command, And never, never see Ormelia more. [Exit Ormelia. Soph. She's gone, and with her all a Lover's Hopesâ My conscious Heart foreboded this Event; I had been happy in a meaner Passion, But doting upon Excellence am lost. How nicely virtuous is her high Resentment? Our Souls are sure akinâStrange Blow of Fortune! That strong Similitude of Sentiment Must seperate the Hearts it should unite! But see my Leon here: Enter Leon. Alas! my Friendâ Leon. Spare the sad TaleâI saw the fierce Ormelia; She glided by me like a fiery Meteor. Soph. Her Temper, as her Beauty, sure is matchless. Leon. Come, think no more of herâthe Soldiers wait usâ They breathe the Spirit of a brave Revenge, That will repair the Loss of Yesterday: Awake thy better Faculties, my Friend; For nothing now is wanting but Sophronius. Soph. Thou dost advise me wellâcome on my Leonâ I'll strive to shake this Softness from my Breastâ The Din of Arms shall drown the Voice of Love. Hark, I am call'd again; [Trumpet sounds] the glorious Summons Rouses my Soul, and fires it on to Battle. Thus the bold, gen'rous Steed, that long in vain Has woo'd some haughty Female of the Plain; If chance he hears the Trumpet's princely Sound, Inspir'd with nobler Ardour spurns the Ground; He snuffs the dusty Tumult from afar, Collects his mighty Rage, and rushes to the War. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SCENE the Piazza. Enter Manuel and Mervan. Manuel. It is my Heart's first Wish; for if my Son Return victorious home, beside the Glory That will accrue to him, and our whole Cause, 'Twill rescue my late Deed from the Reproach Of hasty Rage, and Frowardness of Will, And place it to the fair Account of Wisdom! Mer. How can we doubt Success, my Lord? You mark'd With what high Joy the Troops went forth to Battle, As if their fav'rite Leader had inspir'd them: And sure no Hero ever better grac'd The noble Front of War, than brave Sophronius; I saw him mounted on his snow-white Steed, That mov'd with Pride beneath the Weight he bore; His Eye beam'd martial Fire; and while the Voice Of Thousands heap'd their Blessings on his Head, A crimson Blush (the Badge of modest Merit) Ting'd o'er his youthful Cheek, as I have seen A setting Sun bepaint the western Sky. Man. May he exceed our most exalted Hopes, And silence the proud Spleen of Theodore, That has misconstru'd to the Emperour The Scope of all our Councils. Mer. O 'twas base. But hark! a Shout, my Lord;âa! Shout of Gladness! [Shout within. There's Triumph in that Soundâand see, here's one Whose Looks proclaim the happy News he brings. Enter an Officer. Offi. Peace to Aleppo; and to Manuel Joy, Great as his Soul e'er feltâMy Lord, your Son Returns triumphant home; he hastens hither Quick as the thronging Love of Multitudes Will give him Leave, and best himself shall tell The Manner, and the Progress of the Fight. Man. What! have we conquer'd? Am I justified? Thanks to kind Heav'n; methinks I see this Day Sacred to future Time; Posterity Will cite the glorious Actions of my Boy, And Chiefs, that well have fought their Country's Cause, Hereafter shall be liken'd to Sophronius. Enter Eusebia attended by Ladies. Joy to Eusebia, and her gentle Train; My Child, thy Brother has full well perform'd A Son's and Soldier's PartâPrepare fresh Wreaths, Ye Virgins of Aleppo, for your Champion, And with immortal Verdure deck his Brow. Eus. My Lord, I heard the Peoples Shouts, and came With eager Steps to hail my Brother's Gloryâ But hark! himself and Friends are now approaching. [Trumpet, &amp;c. sound. Enter Sophronius, Leon, Izrail, and other Officers. Man. Welcome my Son, my Captain, my Deliv'rer, Mine and my People's Boast: How fares my Boy, [Meets Sophronius, and embraces him. And these thy Friends, and mine?âI pr'ythee tell me, Tell me thyself, Sophronius, for I long To hear the manly Story of the Battle. Soph. Sir, to do Justice to Aleppian Valour, And to brave Leon's Worth this glorious Day, Were Argument for Rhet'ric's silver Tongue; Yet briefly as I can, I will essay it. Soon as we left our Walls, we found the Foe, In the mid Plain, rank'd in full Pomp of Fight; Sometime we fought beneath a Cope of Arrows, That shadow'd either Hostâbut when we met In horrible Conjunction, then commenc'd The Terrours of the Field; then grim-fac'd War Began his dreadful Game of purple Slaughter, And, like a wounded Lion, rous'd his Rage To Deeds of DesperationâTwo long Hours, With Resolution marvellous, as though The Lordship of the World had been at Stake, The Flame of Battle glow'd; while Victory Stood like a Mistress doubtful where to fix, When two warm Rivals court her gracious Smile. Man. There was a Mistress worth contending for. Soph. At length I chanc'd to cross the Line of Battle Where furious Derar foughtâa Name renown'd In yonder CampâAnd, as I meant to greet him With the full Vigour of a Soldier's Arm, My heedless Step betray'd me, and I fell; Ruin hung o'er meâwhen my Friend, my Leon, Flew like a winged Angel to my Aid, And on his Spear caught the fierce Derar's Sword. Man. It was a noble Deedâand what Reward He can with Justice ask he shall command. Mean while pursue thy Tale. Soph. The Saracen Retir'd; but e'er he could regain his Tribe, A Party of Aleppian Horse inclos'd him, And, in mad Rage, impatient of Restraint, Quench'd his high Valour in a glorious Death. Then first the foremost Ranks gave Way, and soon, As Fear is most infectious, total Rout Encumber'd all their BandsâThe Word was, Havock, And thirsty Vengeance caught itâe'er they reach'd The Camp, the Field was loaded with the Slain. Man. O well-fought Dayâwin such another Conquest, And these Barbarians shall remove their War. Eus. Though thou wast ever dear to me, Sophronius, Trust me, I love thee now from nobler Motives; Thy Sister joys the more in thy Deliv'rance, Because her Country's Safety leans on thine. Soph. The best of us are Instruments, Eusebia, Mov'd by unseen Direction to fulfil The Purposes of Heav'nâthere yield thy Praiseâ My honour'd Father, say this Day's Success Shall sink the Rate of Theodore's high Worth In his own EstimationâI could wish To see him Manuel's Friend. Man. O he'll not stoop To due Subjection; yet in Proof, my Son, That I but hold his Insolence my Foe, Let his proud Soul descend to such Submission, As Honour, not the Pride of State demands, My Hand and Heart again are open to him. Mer. So, we may fall in our own Snare, Romanus. [Aside. Soph. Sir, it was greatly said: Early To-morrow He shall be told the Tenor of this Grace; Let him divide the Post of Honour with me, My future Equal, but my Chief no more; For could we see that Violence of Spirit Temper'd by Councils less impetuous, Envy Might witness to the World, the best of Causes Needs not a better Leader. Man. Be it so; Yet hast thou prov'd this happy Day, Sophronius, That we can fight, and conquer too without him. But Son, thy brave Fatigues demand Refreshment: You and your Friends retireâI'll follow you. [Exeunt Sophronius, Leon, Izrail, &amp;c. Manent Manuel, Eusebia, and her Attendants. Come near, EusebiaâI observ'd but now Thine Eye took sudden Fire at Sight of Leon, And conscious Blushes kindled on thy Cheek: Hast thou not smother'd yet thy foolish Flame? Did I not bid thee shut him from thy Heart? Eus. Speak not thus harshly to me, lest I stand A sad Exception to the gen'ral Joy: Woman at best is weakâbut when she lovesâ Sir, you have seen how poorly I disguis'd My artless Passion, and O look with Pity Upon my Nature's Fault, nor think it mine. Man. So apt, young Mistress? You have learnt, it seems, The common Plea, the Subterfuge of Folly: But I well know a Father's Duty, Girl, Nor will indulge my Child to certain Ruin. Eus. My Lord, I live a Debtor to your Careâ Yet now must humbly think no Danger nigh, But in the Fancy of my Father's Fear. Man. The fond Presumption of a doating Maid! This needy Wooer has beguil'd thy Heart, And holds thee in the Bands of silken Slav'ry, Enamour'd not of thee, but of thy Wealth. Fie on't, it hurts my Thought. Eus. Your Pardon, Sirâ But oh! I cannot judge thus hardly of him. Can there be Falshood in those Heart-fetch'd Sighs, Those tender Pangs, and that Excess of Passion, Which I, and all the Host of Heav'n have seen? O then Sincerity has lost her Proofs, And Love the Vouchers of his Purity. Besides his virtuous Lifeâ Man. I'll hear no moreâ These Striplings cringe, and whine, and sigh by Rule, And Woman flatter'd knows not Art from Virtue. Why do I loiter here? Eusebia, yet Thou art my Daughterâlet not thy Perverseness Soil all the Blessings of this glorious Dayâ Eus. Thus weeping, trembling, riveted to Earth, O let me ask my ever-honour'd Father When he was disobey'd? Man. When did I ask To be obey'd till now? What! thou wouldst plead The slender Service of thy former Years, Which Ignorance and Youth, not Duty paid. Dost thou call this Obedience to a Father? Away, and mark me, I desire Compliance In Instances of greater Weight, or none, Eus. This Resolution may undo me, Sir, But shall not shake my DutyâI submitâ And yet I could have hop'd the hapless Youth That sav'd your Son, and sav'd us all in him, At length might boast Pretension to your Favour. Man. How! wilt thou teach me to reward my Soldiers? But I perceive thy Stubbornness of Folly: Thy blind Affection cleaves to Leon still: And therefore hear a Father's fixt Resolve; Give me a Proof before To-morrow's Noon, Leon no more is Master of thy Heart, Or quit my Roof, repair thee to a Convent, And dedicate thy remnant Days to Heav'n. So shall it sooth my Soul, when I reflect Thou art not mine, to know, thou art not his. Farewel, and think on this. [Exit Manuel. Eus. Tell me, my Virgins, In all the Volumes of recorded Love, Have you e'er read a Destiny like mine? What's to be done?âCan I conceal my Passion? Ah! 'twill betray itself a thousand Ways. But to renounce my Heart's best Joy for everâ My Soul recoils with Horrour at the Thoughtâ Support me, Friends, and with your kindest Counsels, Oh! save a wretched Maid from double Ruin. [Ex. SCENE II. Enter Romanus. Rom. Eusebia, and in Tears! What may this mean? It matters notâthey drop Delight to me, As Tokens of more WoeâLet Mischief flourishâ I was to meet dull Mervan hereâI want To fool him further to my Bentâtill when My Purpose halts, and thou art safe, Aleppoâ Enter Mervan. But lo! he comesâWelcome, my worthy Friend; I need thy Counsel much this fatal Hour; My Soul is fullâBut why that downcast Look? Things wear a better Face since last we parted. Mer. They ne'er look'd worse, Romanus. Rom. How! my Mervan, Hast thou not seen the Man thou hatest most Thrown from his Orb like Lucifer?â'Tis Joy, Worth the young Bridegroom's Transport, thus to stand Safe on the Shore, and view this Wreck of Greatness. Mer. Who falls may riseâThe Sun that's now descended, To-morrow will resume his fiery Function. Rom. Why this School Simile?âWhat mean thy Fears? Mer. I fear not ShadowsâTerms of Amity Will be propos'd to Theodore. Rom. Say'st so? Now Heav'n or Hell forbid. Mer. Nay hear my Tale. Sophronius, still self-diffident, although His Worth mounts daily in the Scale of Glory, With Modesty I ne'er might blame before, Propos'd this fatal Ev'ning to his Father, To share the chief Command with Theodore, Provided small Acknowledgment were paid, As is most due, to Manuel's injur'd Honour. I am content, cries our old Governour, And strait commissions him to make the Treaty. Early To-morrow Morn they will confer; If so, trust me, I doubt our Counsel leaks. For while thou weavest thy Design, Romanus, Fine as the Spider's Web, there's but a Breath 'Twixt that and Dissolution. Rom. My good Mervan, This must not beâI have a Story too Will shake thy honest HeartâHah! Theodore Directs his Steps this WayâI must dissemble; But you, my Friend, insult his fallen Prideâ 'Tis a Debt due to SpleenâYou shall hear more AnonâMy Fortune may assist me now. [Aside. Enter Theodore. The. Romanus, I was seeking theeâWhat means Thy loit'ring here? Rom. We have a trifling Bus'ness That had been soon adjustedâbut I'm ready To hear my Lord's Commands. Mer. Indeed, and should; The General cannot wait his Soldier's Leisure. Rom. For Shame' sake, Peace. The. What does the Abject prate? Reptile, my Soul ne'er look'd so low as thee. Mer. Better you hadâ'tis said your airy Gazers Stand on a tott'ring Baseâa Fall may hurtâ The. What does my Virtue come within the Taunt Of musty common-place Morality, Cull'd from an old Wife's Ev'ning Dialogue? Peace, good Philosophy, I wage not War With Saws, and Ends of Reas'ningâpr'ythee Peaceâ Mer. I have not learnt what Deference is due To a disbanded Soldier. The. Hah! thou Slave, There's that perhaps may teach thee better Manners. [Strikes him. Mer. Seize me eternal Pungency of Pain, But I will be reveng'd, thou brutal Smiter. Rom. Well struckâand well resentedâfor my Purpose. [Aside. Nay but be pacifiedâ [To Mervan. The. How the Cur foams? Revenge! Why that's the Virtue of great Souls That struggle with the Pangs of injur'd Honourâ It is a tender Plant, that flourishes But in a warm well-cultivated Soil, Not seen to thrive in cold and barren Ground. Dost thou, thou Lump of earthly Element, With no more Fire in thy dull Blood than serves Mere Motion, and not Heatâdost thou presume To vent Impatience in exalted Terms, Out of your Sphere of Mutt'ring? Thou revenge! Go, Fool, to BedâRomanus, I would see thee Within an Hourâtill then farewel. [Exit Theodore. Rom. O Mervan, My ever honour'd, and much injur'd Friend, But that the Matter asks maturer Thought, My Poniard should have reach'd the Villain's Heart. Mer. Confusion, and Despair! Rom. Nay, no Despair; For that defeats your Wisdom's Resolution: We'll have Revengeâthe Public shall have Justiceâ The Public, Friend,âthou know'st not yet how much Aleppo's Cause, and thine are interwovenâ Mer. What would Romanus say? Rom. That which might chill The Heart of Stoutnessâoh! suppose this Night, It could be said, Aleppo is no more! Mer. Thou hast a horrid LookâI pray explain itâ Rom. Observe me then with Heed. Mer. Religiously. Rom. Soon as hot Theodore had left the Council, I hied me to his House; and as I knew him Apt of Conception desp'rate, tried to sound The Fathom of his ThoughtâI found him, Mervan, Churning the Froth of FuryâI suggested (Putting the Semblance of fair Friendship on) Topicks of Vengeance to him, nor in vain; He was soon tractable to Works of Darknessâ I urg'd him to betray this hated City, And shew'd apparent Means of Executionâ He prest me to his Bosom, hug'd my Zeal, And swore it was Revenge full adequate To his vile WrongsâI will to Night, he cried, Hear more of thisâYou heard him chide my Stayâ Mer. I didâthe VillainâHeav'n! was this the Man Whom good Sophronius would restore to Honour? How has thy honest Fraud detected him? But I will hence, and startle Manuel's Ear With this ReportâIt must be done to Nightâ Rom. Holdâponder well the Issue with the Deedâ You would charge Theodore with Treason? Mer. Ayâ Rom. And I am ready to support the Charge, But say, with what? what Colour? what Pretence? My Word will weigh no more than Theodore's, And haply less when he disowns the Crime With Protestations back'd by horrid Oath. My single Voice is Slander, and not Proofâ Mer. Nay, spur thy WitâAleppo must be sav'd, And I must have Revenge. Rom. Why, let me seeâ It is the surest Wayâsuppose this Night My Dagger drinks his Bloodâthe Dead, thou know'st, Are no Gainsayers. Mer. RightâproceedâI hear thee With most charm'd Organsâ Rom. To the Governour The Rashness of the Blow shall be excus'd By some well-fram'd, and joint Apology. The Prejudice of Manuel, and the Place You hold in his Opinion sets all right, And everlasting Peace succeedsâ Mer. Well said, my Oracle! Rom. Yet still one Doubt, good Mervan, Draws back my Resolution. Mer. Speak it, Friend. Rom. What if the Villain's Groans, or Marks of Blood Betray me to his Houshold? They may wait not Calmly to weigh the Motives to this Deed, But wreak a sudden Vengeance on my Lifeâ Now could I shew by some plain, pregnant Token, That I therein proceeded by Commissionâ Mer. Hah! To effect that Point is mine, Romanus, Behold Lord Manuel's Signet. [Shewing it. Rom. Give me that And I've a Passport sure. Mer. Take it, 'tis thineâ [Gives it him. And now pursue thy Purposeâlet me hear Before To-morrow's Sun, Aleppo's Foe And Mervan's Bane is levell'd with the Dust. Rom. You shallâgood Night. Mer. Farewelâ [Exit Mervan. Rom. Hah! Hah! The Foolâ How ductile to my Will?âthis magick Ring Will conjure up a Storm to ruin allâ It gains me Credit with my Brain-sick Patron, And blinded Wrath shall take its furious Course By my Directionâthis dread Night, Sophronius, I rob thee of thy Glory; and, proud Nymph,â Will seize sharp Vengeance for thy late Disdain. The Saracen right well my Aid implor'd, For Policy wins more than Othman's Swordâ So when old Greece had seen her Thousands slain, And bravely wag'd a ten Year's War in vain, She last by wily Stratagem prevail'd, And Sinon conquer'd where Achilles fail'd. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. SCENE The Gallery. Enter Theodore. My Wishes lean to fell Revenge; but oh! I know not what of Nicety forbids itâ Some Way my swelling Choler must have Vent; Who ever dam'd the Ocean's Surge, or stopt The thought-quick Fury of the fiery Bolt? That Man preach Peace to meâRomanus comesâ He loves me well, and may devise new Meansâ Enter Romanus. How now Lieutenantâwhy thus lost in Thoughtâ Rom. My Lord, your Pardonâ'tis a private Grief That weighs upon my Heartâ The. Thy Griefs, Romanus, I will make mine. Rom. I owe your Goodness much, But would not now increase the Debtâone Day You shall hear allâhow wears the Time, my Lord! Am I within the Limit of your Order? The. PreciselyâO Romanus since thou first This fatal Day didst wake my sleeping Vengeance, Rage, like a Canker, has been gnawing here. Rom. That's rightâI trust I have thee on the Hookâ [Aside. In Truth my Thought has been to Day employ'd On that same Matter tooâI much admire Your mighty Soul, and own Revenge is Baseness, Unless he marches hand in hand with Honour. The. Away; is there no Vengeance left, Romanus? Are there no Means but those I dare not use? Why didst thou rouse me but to mock my Soul? 'Tis as you'd force the Lion from his Prey, When Famine gripes his EntrailsâO Revenge! Rom. Nay but, great Sir, with noble Minds Contempt Is full RevengeâI am your Proselyteâ But you, I see, like a right skilful Disputant, Can take the Argument by either End. The. No, I not waver in my Sentiment; But, when once crost by Appetite, O shew me The cold, phlegmatic Moralist, that turns not A Rebel to his Tenets. Rom. Fie, Lord Theodore; I thought you master of a better Spirit; These angry Transports are old Manuel's Triumphs. The. I am hem'd in with Plagues. Rom. Those Plagues are over, And Wrath has had his Ventâ The. Ay, but my Soul Retains Impression still. Rom. I fear my Lord, Some added Fuel fires your Breast anewâ The. Why no, I think not, no. Rom. Ah! Sir, I see Your tender Partâthe Battle won this Day By Chance, and Derar's Deathâdoes not that gall you? The. By Heav'n, these vile Aleppian's fought to Day In very Spleen to meâA Group of Curses Light on their squeamish Bravery. Rom. Amen! Yet I'd not grudge the Keenest of my Foes Imperfect, casual Victory like this. How vain Dependance on the Swords of Wretches, That leave the Banner of great-hearted Mars, To trip with feather-footed Mercury?â Let us awayâa Soldier cannot breathe In Air like this. The. Mirror of Honesty! O thou best Guide of my distracted Soulâ Yesâwe will go, RomanusâI submit To what must beâ Rom. Why that was well resolv'd: And since I see your Passion wisely quell'd, I safely may unfold a Tale, that else Should have lain hid in Night's most sable Cloud. Know then, the Matter, you observ'd but now, To rivet down my Strength of Meditation, Related most to thee. The. To me! how now? Rom. You will be calmâ The. As Patience. Rom. Hear me then: My Lord, a Plot is laid against your Life. The. Against my Life?âas how?âby whom, my Friend? Rom. By whom? good Heav'n! I thought you knew your Bane By natural Antipathyâwho is't Has done you wrong? who is't that dismantled My Patron of his Honours? who disgrac'd The Prince of Chivalry? O! who but Manuel? The Devil's not more a Foe to human Race Than he to Theodore. The. Hah! let me hear theeâ The Night is stillâThe Winds are hush'd in Silence, And yon fair Planet, rising with her Train, Shall witness all the Horrours of thy Story. Rom. The Governour, my Lord, with vilest Arts, Has long laid Siege to my Affectionsâ To Day some fav'ring Angel mov'd my Thought To try his Depth of MaliceâI assum'd Sudden Disgust to thee; and in that Conf'rence With hollow Mervan, which your Presence broke, Swore myself henceforth to his Master's Service. The Fool, in whose vile Bosom, you well know, Manuel locks up his Secrets, nails his Faith On my dissembled ZealâYou mark me, Sir,â The. Ay, ay, proceed. Rom. And you did promise me You would be calmâ The. I didâConfusion!âwellâ Go onâI'm cool. Rom. Admitted to old Manuel, I wound me soon into his Confidenceâ My Lord, he bears a most invet'rate Hate To your high Virtue, which he terms your Prideâ Nay more, some Wretch has taught him to suspect, That in your Letters you have oft foul-stain'd His Rule of Government to good Heraclius. The. Letters! what Letters? By my Hopes of Vengeance, But that I scorn to condescend so low As to refute the Calumny; this Night I'd hurl the Rascal Falshood in his Teeth. Rom. I held it meet to cherish this his Spleen, So feign'd me privy to your Correspondence, Nay more, I cited too the black Contents In venom'd Terms, and loud affirm'd them yoursâ Next I enlarg'd upon my proper Wrongs, And vow'd this Night, his full Consent my Warrant, At once to free us both, and the whole World, Of such a VillainâManuel, well-convinc'd Without more Proof, or better Cause than this, Applauded the fell Purposeâay, and quicken'd My Appetite for Vengeance by strong Promise To lift my Fortunes to a splendid Greatness. I'm sworn this Night to stab you in your Sleepâ The. Then I am loos'd at once from ev'ry Tieâ What! Murder me? O! for a Sacrifice Worthy my boiling Rageâwhen I am angry, Methinks Mankind should sufferâgood Romanus, Let Othman know the City's his to Night; The Terms the same asâ Rom. How your Wrath transports you? Thank Heav'n, I'm honestâfor your open Heart Is most accessible to Villainyâ Perhaps I did but mean to try your Temperâ The. Now by the Tempest rolling in my Bosom, I'll not be trifled withâGive me to know The Truth this Instantâsee thou lay'st it plain To my Mind's Eye, and visible as Proofs From Demonstration, or assure thee Villain, Mischiefs await theeâspeakâ Rom. O do not storm: SpeakâI have Nought to speakâindeed 'twas all A well invented Lie, a cut-throat Tale. The. Villain, thou liestâI see thy Heart's Confusionâ [Seizing him. Say all thou know'st, or byâ Rom. I've said too muchâ Yet now, in Justice to myself must onâ Perish the World e'er I deceive my Friendâ See the Credentials of the cursed Trust; What was to be my Sanction for the Deed; Is this Lord Manuel's Signet? [Shewing the Signet. The. 'Tis the same, And darts Conviction on my Sense, as gross As the Broad-Seal of Hellâthen Blood for Bloodâ Romanus, see our trusty Syrians arm'd By Midnight's silent Hour. Rom. Are you resolv'd? The. As the Decrees of Heav'n. Rom. Why then no moreâ My private Sentiment shall yield to yoursâ I will not dare to doubt your Vengeance just: I sav'd your Life to prove my honest Love, And will confirm it more by full Attachment Ev'n to your wildest CounselsâThere's my Hand In earnest of my Heartâ The. As such I take itâ Honest Romanus, how shall I requite The Saver of my Life? Rom. Sir, I will own I had a Prospect of Reward. The. Command it. Rom. O! I have sigh'd the painful Breath of Bondage With the calm Patience of afflicted Saints, Whole Years for fair Ormelia's Love. The. She's thineâ Not my Lieutenant, but my Sonâshe's thine. Rom. Behold her here. Enter Ormelia. The. Ormelia, oh! my Child, Tell me what Blessings wouldst thou wish the Man, That has preserv'd thy Father from Destruction? Orm. O I would wish him all that Heav'n e'er crown'd The Piety of his best Vot'ries with; All that his Heart could ask; all Comforts here, And Certainty of golden Bliss hereafter. The. Then hear me and obeyâthere's my Deliv'rerâ This fatal Night by Manuel's curst Design Romanus stands engag'd to shed my Blood; See here the Token of that hellish Trustâ [Shewing the Signet. His feign'd dislike of me explor'd this Treach'ry: Ay, and his Faith of Friendship has been brib'd With offers worth Ambitionâask no moreâ But bless his gen'rous Goodness with thy Love, And make me happy in a Son like him. Orm. Forgive me, Theodore, if for a while Distracted by Variety of Passion, I know not what to answerâ The. We allow The Niceness of reluctant Modesty To maiden Innocenceâmean time, Romanus, Fix we our Thought on this Night's bloody Bus'ness,â I pray advise me in itâ Rom. Sir, to you, And yours, I owe more Service than the best Of my poor Zeal can payâfor this same Bus'ness, Resolv'd, 'tis doneâYour House stands on the Walls, From whence a Soldier may descend unseen, And bear the welcome News to yonder Camp; Let them approach the Town with silent March; Just as the Bell beats one, our Syrian Troop Shall take Possession of the Armory; Then slay the Centinels, seize all the Gates, And let the Torrent of Confed'rates in, Eager, and rushing on to gen'ral Ruin. The. Be't soâAleppo's doom'dâJustice has lent Her Sword to black RevengeâRomanus, send me The Captains of our Troop to take their Ordersâ For this one Night, O Mahomet, I'm thine. [Ex. The. Rom. At that Command, I have been wont to fly, As swift as Fancy's Wingâyet now would stay, To catch the Glances of Ormelia's Eyes, And hear her Sentence on my faithful Passion, Tho' the World's Doom depended on this Hour. Orm. That Sentence, Sir, is pastâYou heard my Fatherâ I cannot, must not, would not disobey him; Nay and could wish I had a Heart to give To Worth like thine, for I confess, Romanus Your Merit far superiour to your Claim. Rom. Grant it but equalâcan my lovely Fair Withold a Heart she owns herself my Due, And without which I scorn to take her Hand? No, I renounce the Right thy Father gave me; I did my Dutyâbut would have my Blessing Ormelia's Gift, not hisâ Orm. Thou gen'rous Man! I thought there was no Passage to my Heart, But sure the grateful Sentiment that warms My Soul, if 'tis not Love, is something greater. Rom. Cherish that Sentiment my Guardian Pow'rs! And kindle it to Rapture such as mine. Orm. Yet say, is this a Time-for Love, Romanus? How sacred ev'ry Moment is to Vengeance? The Deed and Guilt are Manuel'sâyoung Sophroniusâ Nay do not startâhe is no more your Rivalâ And yet I would not know him for a Villain: Was he consenting to this cruel Purpose? Rom. Madam, 'twere base, or to disparage Virtue With scanty Praise, or wrap it up in Silence. Sophronius is right nobleâbut this Ev'ning, Though Conquest sat upon his shining Plume, And he stood loaded with a People's Praise; He own'd the Prowess of your Father's Valour; He will'd old Manuel offer Terms of Peace, Which Theodore might well embrace with Honourâ Ev'n Manuel's self dissembled Approbation, And veil'd the Malice lurking at his Heart. Orm. O wond'rous Proof of thy unequall'd Goodness? Sophronius only is outdone by theeâ The Man thou praisest is the Man I lov'd; E'en now (with Blushes I disclose my Weakness) My Heart almost revolts from Thee and Virtueâ But thy Perfections awe the Thought to Shameâ Gratitude, Honour, Duty make me thine, And Inclination ought. Rom. I know it willâ Such Excellence can never do amissâ If fondest Care, if Industry of Love, Canâ Orm. Holdâ'tis needless thisâmy future Faith I pledge to thee for ever. Rom. Blessings on thee! Oh! let me grasp this Crisis of my Fate, Now all my better Stars propitious beam, And farther humbly hopeâ Orm. What wouldst thou ask?â Rom. You would be mine this happy Night. Orm. To Night! Have you forgot? Rom. Nay! by yon Heav'n, my Wish Is pure as is the stainless Thought of Childhood. Ne'er should my Soul relax to soft Desires, Till Scenes more calm, and peaceful Sunshines bless us; But kindly place it in my Pow'r hereafter To say, this glorious, this distinguish'd Night, I saw my Bliss complete, my Lord aveng'd, Aleppo punish'd, and thyself my Bride. Orm. Sir, I am yours in Honour of Engagement. Rom. Engagement!â'tis too faint, too cold a Word, And damps the rising Ardour of my Soulâ Give my high Hopes the Title of thy Husband, And I shall rush like Lightning on the Foe; Or if some unforeseen, some dreadful Chance, Should whelm me in the Tumult of the Fight, At least I shall indulge a virtuous Pride, And smile in Death to call Ormelia mine. Orm. Nay this is Humour most extravagant. Rom. 'Tis noble Eagerness of great Ambition. But oh! 'tis vainâI see thro' the Disguise Of this Reluctance, and perceive thy Heart Unwilling to oblige a Wretch like me;â And can she love who scruples to oblige? Impossible!âDie ev'ry flatt'ring Hope! Welcome the Anguish of a fruitless Passion, It is Ormelia's Doom, and I must bear it. [Weeps. Orm. Weep not, Romanus; for thy Tears reproach me; They call me stubborn, cruel, and ungrateful; If I mustâ Rom. Noâby yon bright Orb, you shall not; I'd not be happy upon selfish Terms, Or purchase endless Peace with thy Disquiet: Haste to thy Loveâbe blest in thy Sophroniusâ While I in Sorrow languish Life away, And fall the willing Victim of thy Beauty. Orm. Forbid it, all ye Pow'rs that guard the Just! Thy Virtues banish ev'ry female Form, And I this Moment yield my vanquish'd Hand. Rom. Thus let me thank thee for this dear Compliance; [Kissing her Hand. Angels, proclaim my Ecstacy of Bliss, And tune your Harps to sweet Ormelia's Praise. I fly, my Love, to seek a holy Priest Whose ready Ministry may crown my Transports. Soon let me find you in your own Apartment; Till whenâone balmy KissâHeav'n guard thy Goodnessâ Soânow I have my Fortune in my Hand. [Aside and exit. Orm. Wellâ'tis obey'd, this Dictate of my Honour, And sure, I've nobly sacrific'd to Virtue! Farewel, Sophroniusâ'twas a tender Sigh Which wafted that Farewelâbut 'tis the lastâ Hah! he is here!âGood Heav'n, of all the World The Man I would not seeâ Enter Sophronius. Sir, you are bold; I thought I had forbidden you my Presence. Soph. Though banish'd from thy Sight, my constant Thought Has ne'er stray'd from theeâand I come once more To know my utmost Fortune: The sad Exile Revisits thus with Doubts and pleasing Dread His native Land, not dearer to his Soul, Than late to me was my Ormelia, when She welcom'd me with hospitable Love, And made her Heart my Homeâonce, no strange Guest, May I not hope again, on noble Terms, To gain Admittanceâ Orm. 'Tis too late to talk Of Terms, and Hope is mere Presumption nowâ Soph. Forbid it, LoveâLord Theodore, To-morrow, If I mistake not, is my Father's Friend. Orm. Impossible! Soph. Let but Ormelia hear me. I bring him easy Terms of Reconcilement. Orm. I have heard all. Soph. Is then thy Father's Spirit Still so untractable, he will admit Friendly Proposals upon no Conditions? Orm. You must not hope to see him Manuel's Friendâ Soph. At least that's not my Crimeâsure we may loveâ And wait for happier DaysâIf thou know'st all, Sophronius stands acquitted in thy Sight. Orm. I am no Judge in such a Cause as this, And must not hear you pleadâ Soph. Is't possible? Still cold to all I sayâIs this the Maid, That oft has sat attentive to my Vows, While the gay Hours were all bespoke by Love, And Moments were not wasted, but enjoy'd? And when I pour'd my am'rous Rapture forth, Would she not sometimes aid me with her Sighs, Or bless the tender Story with a Tear? But now she looks relentless on my Sorrowsâ Nor feels one friendly Pain of Pity for me! Orm. Alas! I dare not listen to this Talk. Soph. Yet e'er I part for ever from thy Beauties, Let me be told my CrimeâArt thou unjust, As well as most unkind? If thou art false, Ev'n for thy Sake, I'll not suppose hereafter A Woman can be trueâI'll think thee still The brightest of thy SexâPerhaps, Romanusâ Am I supplanted by my Rival's Love? His Merit must be rais'd by Miracleâ Yet grant him all Perfection, if I know My Heart, he cannot, cannot love like me. Orm. Oh! [Fainting; he catches her. Soph. Heav'n! she faintsâWhat would my wayward Fortune? Awake, my Life, my LoveâSee, she revives, Her Beauties burst like Sun-Beams from a Cloud. Orm. Why hast thou call'd me back to Misery? My Soul was never Womanish till nowâ Who can resist such Tenderness as thine? Though Heav'n and Earth conspire against our Loves, I feel my Heart will still acknowlege theeâ Yet we must partâI never can be yours. Soph. What means my Life? Repriev'd and doom'd at once! Part! Who shall part us if thy Will consents? Though Theodore or Manuel should oppose, Our Union, the best Pledge of Reconcilement, It were enough that 'tis approv'd by Heav'n. Orm. No, my Sophronius, Heav'n decrees against itâ The Voice of Conscience, Reason, Justice, Duty, Loud thunders in my Ear, It must not be. To-morrow will explain the Mistery I cannot now revealâFarewel for everâ Poor hapless Youth! I see thy struggling Breast, And mine too labours with an equal Pangâ Soph. Yet stay! For ever, didst thou say, Ormelia? Ah! whither shall I turn?âAre all Things sacred Arm'd against Truth and Innocence? Ye Pow'rs, What strange Event will this To-morrow bring? Ev'n now those Eyes are bent with Fondness on meâ Thy Heart is panting with the Sighs of Love, And ev'ry soft Emotion pleads my Causeâ Can I despair with Joys like these in View, And be distrest with Happiness before me? Orm. Adieu! SophroniusâI must hear no moreâ Upbraid me not with Falshood or Unkindnessâ But when the dreadful Truth shall glare upon thee, Lay thy Reproaches where thou seest them due. The Blessings of eternal Peace be with thee, And Honour crown thy DaysâO when hereafter You chance to call this Night to your Remembrance, (As sure you will have Cause) speak of Ormelia In gentle Terms, (so shall I speak of thee) And own my Mem'ry worth a tender Thought. Once more adieu! Sophronius. [Exit. Soph. [After a Pause.] Think not, Man, To trace the secret Maze of Providence, Or ascertain the Fortune of an Hour. My Leon hereâ[Enter Leon] Thou Partner of my Sorrow, Why hast thou left the Palace? Leon. My Sophronius, I come for thee: For oh! without thy Presenceâ Now my Eusebia has forsook the World, Banish'd by fatal Love of wretched Leon, Though Mirth and Triumph raise their jocund Voice, And the Roof echoes to the Sounds of Joy, To me thy Father's House is desolate. Soph. I will return with thee; and as we go, Thou shalt be told my most uncommon Lotâ O could my Soul anticipate To-morrowâ But wear we calm Content upon our Brows, And join the general Festivityâ In Love though both have been unhappy, Leon, We have a Refuge in our Friendship stillâ Love is at best, my Friend, a virtuous Weakness; The Appetite of Nature, not its Glory; And ev'n the purest is alloy'd with Folly. Friendship is wholly rational; the Ardour Of gen'rous Minds, the Rapture of the Soul, Preservative of Love, and its Survivor. Leon. Excellent Youth, my Sorrow's Remedy, Methinks I catch the glorious Theme from thee. Dear are the sacred Characters in Life Of Father, Brother, Sister, Husband, Wife; But the prime Gift that bounteous Heav'n can send, Is the sure Blessing of a faithful Friend. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. SCENE a magnificent Apartment in the Governour's Palace. Manuel, Sophronius, Izrail, Leon, and others sitting at a Table, with Wine, &amp;c. Manuel. Once more Prosperity to our Aleppo, And Thanks to my Sophroniusâ[Drinks.] Izrail, say Where points the Hour of Night? Iz. In Truth, my Lord, I doubt we borrow of the Morning now. Man. Here then break up our FeastâShew we our Joy, Like Christian Soldiers, and not Revellers; A Health to all our Friends, and then good Night. Iz. Health and sweet Slumbers to the Governour. [Drinks. A great Cry within. Help, fly, O Mercy, Quarter, spare us, Mercy! Soph. What means that dreadful Cry? I fear some Treach'ry. Enter an Officer hastily. Offi. O we are lost, betray'd, undone; the Saracens Are in the Streets, and furious Theodore Is at their Head, dealing Destruction roundâ The Centinels are slain, the Armory Is seiz'd by the vile SyriansâHark, I hear The Thunder of the Tempest drive this Way. [The Cry is heard again as nearer. Soph. This was thy fatal Mystery, Ormelia. [Aside. Enter another Officer. Off. Fly, my Lord, flyâthe Palace Gates are forc'dâ Othman and Theodore come storming onâ I saw him drive his Sword in Mervan's Breastâ Hah! they are hereâ Man. I'll not survive this Hourâ Come let us fall like Menâ Enter Theodore, Othman, and others, with Swords drawnâThey fightâTheodore wounds Manuel; Leon interposes;âthen Sophronius speaks. Soph. Hold, Friends; 'tis Madnessâ Ye Saracens forbearâthe City's yoursâ [They give up their Swords. We fight not against Providenceâbut, Othman, O let not loose the horrid Rage of War Upon the Citizens; spare their Distress, And save thy own Renown. The. Hah! who art thou That would'st command here still? Oth. Nay, Theodore, But hear a noble Foe.âWe have already Mark'd well our Way with BloodâGo, Omar, bid The Hand of Slaughter and of Pillage cease Upon Submissionâ[Exit an Officer] Christians, you may note, How Heav'n confirms the Cause of Mahomet, And owns us as He did his once-lov'd People, When Canaan's warlike Nations sunk before them. See then, and be convertedâor hereafter Pay annual Tribute to my Lord the Caliphâ I leave you to resolve your speedy Choice, And for the rest, Romanus will inform you. [Exit Othman. Soph. We have not much to learn. Alass! my Father, You bleedâHelp here, my Friendsâ [They place him in a Chair. Man. No HelpâI've seen Aleppo lost, and would not be immortal: Why should an old Man live? You whose Veins bound With youthful Blood, live to revenge your Country: I would escape from Life, and that black Traitorâ The. Wouldst thou upbraid me, Villain, with a Deed That thy own Baseness caus'd? Man. Pr'ythee away, And let me die in Peace. The. Die, and thy Malice Sink thee to lasting PainâWhere's my Romanus? [Exit Theodore. Man. Come near me, Friends; I have few Words to speak; Sophronius, thou art Heir to all my Fortunes; But 'tis my Pride to leave thee rich in Virtueâ See thou protect my Friendsâwould I could say My other ChildrenâI have wrong'd thee, Leonâ Thy honest Zeal did interpose to save me, Ev'n when I had no Daughter to reward theeâ Canst thou forgive my Frowardness? Leon. I doâ Oh! ifâHah! who comes here? Ye Pow'rs above! It is Eusebia's Selfâ Enter Eusebia attended: She runs to her Father and kneels: Both silent some Time. Man. My Childâ Eus. My Fatherâ Your Pardon and your Blessing e're you dieâ Man. Thou hast a Right to bothâalas! my Daughter, I thought thee shut within the Convent's Walls. Eus. O! Sir, forgive a Fraud which Love inspir'd: Beneath the Shelter of a friendly Roof Till now I have conceal'd me, fondly hoping That such suppos'd Retirement from the World, While it might testify my Leon's Truth, Would melt at length a Father's Heart to Pity. Man. It has, it hasâand this unhop'd Return Darts Gleams of Comfort on my parting Hourâ Take my best Blessing to theeâtake thy Leonâ Thy dying Father's most acknowleg'd Friendâ Sophronius, see thy Brother and thy Sisterâ Soph. Both Sharers of my Heart, and my Inheritance. Man. EnoughâThe Shades of Night hang o'er my Brow. Bury my Frailties with me; O, my Friends, Yet while you may, defend our holy Faith; There is much Christian Ground unconquer'd stillâ Yield not a Jot to Mahometâremember, 'Tis glorious to assert the Cause of Truth In unbelieving TimesâFarewel, my Friends, Farewel, my Children; and oh!â [Dies. Soph. Worthy Departure of a Patriot Soul: Sister, the tender Tribute of thine Eye Is justly paidâfor us, my Brother Leon, (How sweetens that soft Name the Cup of Sorrow?) Our Rev'rence for dead Manuel's Memory Prove we another Way; by Deeds, not Tearsâ Remove the BodyâSee it laid, Eusebia, In decent State, not Pageantry of Pompâ So shone my Father's Virtuesâ Izrail, stay; [Ex. with the Body, Eus. Leon, &amp;c. Some unknown Motive may have urg'd this Treasonâ I would learn allâSee! Theodore returnsâ Enter Theodore. Sir, I well know thy Name renown'd in Armsâ But do not number this among your Triumphsâ The. It is not Triumph, Boy! 'tis Something more; 'Tis Something that methinks I would not change For the wide Fame of CÃ¦sarâIt is Justice! The Satisfaction of a great Revenge! The Transport of a mighty Soul, inflam'd By basest Wrongs, and pleas'd with public Ruin! Soph. I thought a Soldier never would have talk'd thus; A Christian ought not. The. Tell not not me of Rules;â Souls of Ã¦thereal Temper are not held In vulgar Circumscription; they start wide From Duty's Path by innate, fiery Impulse, Which gracious Heav'n signs Dispensation toâ Yet think not I have done this Deed To-night, Provok'd by mere Resentment of Ambition, Though my great Heart but ill digests Dishonour: There is a Cause behind thou know'st not of, A Cause might force the saint-like Eye of Meekness To sparkle with the angry Dragon's Beam. Soph. What may this mean? Do we not all well know The Weight, and utmost Reach of thy Complaints? The. No, Stripling, noâHark youâI'll tell you Newsâ Your Father Manuel was a bloody Villainâ Soph. Thou liestâI am unarm'dâor by my Hopesâ The. He meant this Night to murder me in Bed. Soph. It is impossible!âI had his Order This Day to bring you Terms of Reconcilementâ The. Curse the HypocrisyâHere comes the Man, My Friend, my Son, that was to do the Deedâ Enter Romanus drest as a Bridegroom. Come to my Armsâ[embracing Romanus.] Is that a Murd'rers Face? Fool! to suspect Romanus for a Villainâ Soph. How's this? Your Friend, and Son! If this could beâ And yet it could not beâ The. See, and be dumb: See an authentic Proof of barb'rous Trustâ [Shewing the Signet. If this be Manuel's Signet, soâif not, Let the Arch-Devil come from Hell, and own it. Soph. Amazement! Izrail, know'st thou aught of this? Iz. No, as my Soul shall prosperâ Rom. Come, my Lords, I'll end this Strife at onceâ The. Do, good Romanus. Rom. First, as the Prologue to my Tale, know allâ I own the sacred Law of Mahomet. The. Hah! Slave, what hast thou said? revoke thy Wordsâ Rom. Nay but revoke thy Words, proud Theodore; I was your Slave, the Spaniel of your Humour; But my great Soul, superiour to its Bondage, At length, has shook the vile Dependance off, And now I'm Lord of thee, and of Aleppo. The. Damnation! thou art mad. Rom. Or you shall beâ You will not hear me then? The. Ay, I will hear theeâ I'll know this Fate, though ev'ry Word thou utter'st Bites like the Viper's Fang. Rom. Attend, and tremble. What Time I was a Pris'ner in yon Camp, I left your barren, Christian Law, to thrive In the rich Harvest of a growing Faithâ And made the League with Othman, which this Night Has seen fulfill'dâI saw thy fiery Nature Had shap'd thee a fit Tool for my Designâ The slighted Mervan, whom my frequent Vows Of equal Hate to thee had made my own, By my Direction poison'd Manuel's Ear With groundless, brain-forg'd Tales, that wak'd his Spleen, And blew the fatal Flame of Strife between you. The. Oh! Rom. This Attempt, failing of wish'd Success, I practis'd yet again on hollow Mervan, Who, fool'd by me, believ'd your desp'rate Rage Meant to betray Aleppo to the Foe; But as I had not seeming Proof enough To bring a public Charge of such vile Treason, I undertook this Night to spill your Bloodâ Lord Manuel's Signet (for I feign'd the Deed Ev'n in the Act lay level to Discov'ry) Was in such Case to screen the Blow from Questionâ So, Sirs, you have a Key to all my Counselâ Why raves my noble Lord?âI sav'd your Lifeâ The. Monster, thou liestâthou well didst know my Life Was wrapt up in my FameâThat thou hast stab'd; And Murder, when compar'd with Guilt like thine, Smiles like a soft-ey'd CherubâOh! Sophronius! [Leans upon Sophronius. Rom. You paid my Service with your haughty Daughter; Who, well assur'd of my transcendent Merit, Gave me her Hand this Nightâthat once obtain'dâ Sighs and Entreaties, raptur'd Vows and Oaths, And the fond Pleadings of a Husband's Right, Have gain'd me since the sweet Revenge I wish'd forâ Now tir'd of Love, and all its vain Delights, Gladly I quit the galling Noose of Wedlockâ Thou, or Sophronius take herâ Soph. Matchless Villain! The. Hah! 'twas well thought. [Aside.] Romanus, the Account 'Twixt me and thee is yet unsettledâthus [Pulls a Dagger from his Breast, and stabs Rom. With willing Hand I pay thee all thy Due. Rom. Death, Hell, and black Perdition! I am slain. [Dies. The. Fiends seize thy SoulâCome give me Joy, Sophronius; For I have done one righteous Act To-dayâ I thought to stain this Blade with Manuel's Bloodâ Now let his Spirit smile upon the Strokeâ Heav'n marks it in the Record of my Works:â But see where Murder, Treason, Sacrilege, Are wrote in Leaves of adamant against itâ You stand amaz'dâbut wherefore?âIs a Villain A Sight so rare?âO from this Day, the wicked, The Outcasts of fair Grace shall bless themselves, And quote my Deed with the pert Pride of Censure. If there be Ease in Madnessâ Soph. Come, reflectâ The. Reflect! on what? eternal Loss of Honour? The flaming Mouth of Hell that yawns before me, Yields me a brighter ProspectâAll my Thought Is steady, fixt, immoveable Despair. Who never hopes can never be deceiv'dâ But Bus'ness must be doneâYour Pardon, Sirsâ This is no Place for Traitorsâgive me Room there. [Exit Theodore. Soph. What strong Commotion shakes him? Woful Day! Alas! how brittle is the stablest Structure That human Policy, or Prowess raises! One Villain's Breath dissolves itâHah! Ormeliaâ She bends this WayâIzrail, I pray retireâ [Exit Izrail. Fortune diversifies the Scene of Horrour. Enter Ormelia: Seeing the Body of Romanus she starts. Orm. Angels defend me with your golden Wings From this heart-striking Sight!âMy Lord! My Husband! Will not the lov'd Ormelia's Voice awake thee?â Nay then thy gallant Soul has burst her Clay, And I am left to endless Desolation A wretched, widow'd BrideâWhat barb'rous Hand Could thusâbut I may spare my Tongue the Question. Soph. Unhappy Fair! thou seest I have no Weapon; My Hand, my very Soul is now disarm'dâ Didst thou know allâ Orm. Know what? Equivocator! Thou Thorn, for ever rankling in my Peace! Thou hadst a Weapon when thou didst the Deed; And let me tell you, Sir, it was a Feat Worthy Aleppo's Gen'ral. Soph. O Ormelia, My Heart weeps for theeâSoon, believe me, soon These high-ton'd Strains shall sink to Notes of Woe, Or float upon the wildest Sounds of Rage. Orm. Behold a Cause for endless Rage, thou base oneâ Didst thou not mark the Pang that wrung my Soul, When I left thee for him, only for him That now lies blood-steep'd there?âThou knew'st me his By ev'ry sacred Tieâyet him thy Hand Has poorly slainânot so he treated theeâ The partial Tongue of most enamour'd Fondness, Could scarce have drest its chosen Idol up In Terms of fairer Hue, than those To-night He deck'd your Name withalâ Soph. I slew him notâ Or if I hadâalas! thou injur'd Maidâ Orm. Dissembler, ceaseâI know your specious Plea Of Love for your dear City justly lost; With this you mean to gloss a horrid Act, Which gratified the Rancour of thy Soul, And proves thee true-born Son of murd'rous Manuel. Soph. O vain Reproach! Know, Madam, I would boast The Virtues, not the Greatness of my Race, And wish to prove myself the Son of Manuel, To make his Loss more light. Orm. What! is he fall'n? Thanks to the righteous Vengeance that destroy'd him. Soph. It was thy Father's Vengeanceâbut if righteous, All moral Difference of Good and Ill Is the Delirium of a sickly Dreamâ Oh! you're undoneâHow wilt thou start to find Romanus fell by Theodore's own Hand, The Friend avow'd of Mahomet, the Foe Of Theodore, of Manuel, thee, and all! Canst thou not read my Heart?âDost thou not see Softest Compassion melt upon my Brow, And Agony distend my tott'ring Frame? Oh! poor Ormelia! Orm. Madness and Illusion! Must I not trust my Sense? Hah! who art thou, Enter an Officer hastily. That with such ghastly Aspect wouldst deliver Some dreadful Tale? Offi. It most concerns you, Ladyâ As I past by yon Chamber, I descry'd Lord Theodore in most distemper'd Motion; He travers'd wildly o'er the Room, like one Whose fav'rite Scheme Somewhat unlook'd for marrs; Now sudden he stopt short, and, sitting down, Fast rivetted his Eye unto the Floor; Then started up, and smote upon his Bosom; Then spread his Arms to Heav'n, and with his Foot Stampt hard, as tho' he meant to shake the Roof; At length, with a deep Groan, that would have melted The Soul of Cruelty to baby Mildness, Hasty he drew a Dagger from his Bosom, And plung'd it in his Side. Orm. Death and Destruction!â Offi. Amaz'd I call'd for Help, and forc'd the Doorâ The Servants rais'd him up; they bring him hitherâ For here he learnt you wasâLo! where they come. [Theodore brought in in a Chair, with Officers, Servants, &amp;c. Orm. Ye Moralists! O teach me Patience now! The. Ormelia!âart thou here? Draw near, my Child;â Thy Tenderness shall chear my latest Moments, And light me through the darksome Gate of Death. Orm. Help; bind his Woundsâ The. Hold off: Did Manuel die Because he'd not survive his Country's Ruin, And should the Villain live that has betray'd her? Live, like a wounded Beast, to drag about A wretched Being with a broken Heart? What! live to be a Mark of public Scoff For Holiday Mechanics?âWelcome, Death! Thou art at least a Change of Misery, And I would fly to other Ills for Shelter. Orm. What does my trembling Heart forebode?âSophronius Has told meâ The. Nought but Truth. Orm. There lies my Husbandâ The. Slain by this Hand, a Villain and Impostor. The blackest Guile that Treachery e're wore Were snow-white Innocence and Truth to his: Soon thou'lt know allâWe've been abus'd, my Daughter. Orm. Abus'dâhow my Brain turnsâWho has abus'd us? Not heâwhy, he was HonestyâI knew him. The. Strengthen her tender Frame, all gracious Heav'n! And for the Woes thy Justice heaps on me, O doubly, doubly bless my dearest Child. Orm. How heartily he praysâCome let's pray allâ O hear me, hear meâdo not die, my Father! [Kneels down by her Father. The. Unhappy Girl!âI did not know till now The Bitterness of DeathâI must leave theeâ Ev'n when thou want'st a Friend, and Father most. Behold the Woman you once lov'd, Sophronius; O hadâit cuts me thereâwilt thou forgive me, And shield my Name from popular Reproach? Thine Eye sheds friendly GriefâI thank thy Goodnessâ Now it grows darkâpray for my flitting Soulâ Take my last Look, OrmeliaâBless her, oh!â [Dies. Orm. Let him aloneâhe will be up To-morrowâ And drive the Saracens like Chaff before himâ Soft, place him easyâhis Brain ach'd last Nightâ I'll make a Pillow of the Peach's Down To rest his Cheek uponâWe'll deck him fineâ Come, stick his Couch with shining Pearls, fresh cull'd From the gay Morning's DewâSoâthat's well doneâ Now lay him, like a mighty Emperour, Beneath the painted Rainbow's sumptuous Archâ He sleeps most soundlyâwellâgood Night, my Jewel.â And now I'll to my LoveâHah! hah! Soph. Ye Pow'rs, Heal her disorder'd Mind! Orm. Hah! who goes there? Fellow, stand offâIt is my LoveâI know him; If I can catch him, I shall cleave for ever; [She lays hold on Sophronius. Hot Pincers shall not part usâHeav'n and Earth! My Husband's comeâoff, vile Adulterer! [Pushing Sophronius from her. Oh! he has two red Firebrands in his Eyes, And a long Whip of Scorpions in his Hand. Forgive me, nay I did but snatch one Kissâ I'll wear my Knees out on the rugged Flintâ Soph. Most pitiable Sight. Orm. Oh! he is goneâ Why Weeps my Love?âHah! there he is again; Give me my WingsâO hide me, hide me from him. [Exit raving. Soph. Attend her, Sirs, and bear her gently homeâ [Exeunt some, manet the rest. Alas! my Presence would inflame her moreâ To what am I reserv'd? All-righteous Heav'n, Support me in these Trials of my Virtue, Check the rebellious Sallies of Impatience, And give me Courage to submit to thee. Enter Leon, Eusebia, and Izrail. Leon, what Havock have we seen To-day? Leon. But look we forward now, Sophronius; Othman Has sent by me to know our last Resolves. Soph. For meâI will repair to good Heracliusâ Hast thou forgot what pious Manuel said? Who knows but we may yet avenge our Cause, And one Day call Aleppo ours again? The glorious Hope amuses my Heart's Sorrow, And War shall be my Recreation nowâ Eus. We'll follow thee. Leon. And I. Iz. And I. Offi. And all. I trust, my Lord, no Soldier stays behind. Soph. Then be it soâmy Friends, 'tis still our Glory We were surpriz'd, not conquer'd. This Day's Woe Yields us a MoralâNot to loose the Rein To the fierce Impulse of impetuous Anger. [Pointing to Theodore.] The Man, whose Bosom headstrong Passion sway'd, And the blind Zeal of eager Rage betray'd, Though brave by Nature, and in Action great, Work'd his own Ruin, and Aleppo's Fate.
