      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Chamber in Brecon Castle. Barnabas and the Master Falconer. BARNABAS. The Lord of Builth, and master everywhere. His uncle's burial issues in a feast; Therefore he will be merry. What cares he How sadly show the hangings overhead, So that the wine-cup sparkle ruddily? I look for pipes and cornets by-and-bye. With this his uncle he did eat and drink; And now he eats and drinks because of him. FALCONER. Since noon I doubted of his holiday. Pray Heaven he spare the minstrelsy to-night! BARNABAS. My place was with the warders last of all, I could not see the Earls at setting forth. FALCONER. He, Geoffrey, Lord of Builth by soccage fief, Must ride to church chief mourner, in the midst 'Twixt Mahel and the Earl of Hereford! BARNABAS. This Builth would take the first man's place from Adam! FALCONER. A younger brother's child is nearer kin Than Bernard Newmark's son and son-in-law! Of greater majesty than two such earls! Ever till now men's issue were their heirs. BARNABAS. The heralds called their names? FALCONER. Ay, orderly, With little learning in their craft they might: The next in blood is highest in degree. First Mahel, Earl of Brecon: after him Fitzwalter, Earl of Hereford: and last, This kinsman Geoffrey Newmark, Lord of Builth. BARNABAS. What did he then? FALCONER. Spurred right betwixt the two: Nor might the pursuivants stop, turn, or shame him. He bent D'Eyle's silver sceptre 'cross his pate For only thinking of it. BARNABAS. What said Mahel? FALCONER. He?ânot one word. Grief-choked and blind with tears, He cared not how he went. So Builth rode midst Through Castlegate and Boroughgate to church, Despite of Hereford, whose choice was patience, Or blows, or turning back again. BARNABAS. He fills His cushion at the feast by some such tenure; And once again usurps Fitzwalter's place. The guests bareheaded stood beside their stools, And in walked Hereford with horns before himâ Grooms, vergers, chamberlains, apparitorsâ Sir Humphrey Uske, Sir Giles, Saint Vallery, But first, the Seneschal to clear his way. Straight toward the steps, and where the board runs crosswise He treads suspicionless as heretofore: And lo! what finds he there but Geoffrey Builth In state, as host, beneath the baldichin! A lord amongst his lieges! FALCONER. Mercy on us! BARNABAS. Builth calls out âstools and trenchersâ lustily, âRoom for his noble kinsman Hereford;â But still he keeps his seat. Fitzwalter stares, Then turns him round to speak that all may hearâ âOur shrovetide gambols last till midsummer.â With that he leads his servants down the hall, And fairly out of it. FALCONER. They ring the beakers! Empty again! Run, Barnabas! (Exeunt.) SCENE II. A Chamber in the Castle. Mahel and Father Stephen. STEPHEN. Our lord at last! Health to the Earl of Brecon! With all things good and happy all life through! Ten days ago we might have hailed him thus: But death had yet scarce left the vacant chair, And grief, as envious of a new possessor, Still kept her place beside it. In his shroud Our ancient master ruled us all! we feared Division of our reverence between you: So stinted homage even to his heir. Methought the bell which tolled us home from church, Maintained so long his awe and sovereignty: Its last stroke set us free. Our duty now Is pleased and single too: old love still serves, Though clad in fresher livery. Take thy place Still higher as Newmark's Son than Brecon's Earl: Keep it with all thy might. The meek are blessedâ Both worlds are theirs by promiseâtake them both: Be gentle still, and henceforth resolute! MAHEL. The rather that my father hoped it not, I will be so. STEPHEN. He ever loved thee best, Even as it was, when farthest out of sight. Betwixt himself and what he wished in thee, A county's breadth had been too strait for peace. MAHEL. My duty was not measured by his love. I have not paid back honor as he earned it. Above his sepulchre I stood to-day, As I would wish that both may stand for judgment, With no reproachful thoughts to plead against me, Remembering hasty words and rebel hopes: Nor was pride called as counsellor to grief. So far my heart upbraids me not. STEPHEN. I know it. In that light government which ends at last, My speed was winged as swiftly as my prayersâ A prosperous charge and easy to meâyet I sometimes tremble at mine own success, Mistrusting whether what I toiled to doâ Good questionless apart from that it ends inâ Being timed unseasonably, and placed amiss, May not prove evil to thee. MAHEL. Thou didst teach That what is good is singly so, or ceases: We cannot mix or change it. STEPHEN. True, I did: Yet some respect it has to circumstance; For wise conformity is also good. Too stubborn good, being proud, is so far evil. We must retrench a little from its wealth To furnish out our fortunes worthily. Pure thoughts, fair customs, gracious biases Are such to life as sailors to their ship, Who guide it through the waters by their skill, But neither choose the voyage nor rule the wind. They sometimes steer their course a point awry, And indirectly reach their port the sooner. Alas, I see thee blush for me! Well, do soâ It shows that grace is still with one of us. MAHEL. If only one, it cannot be with me. Whither wouldst lead me, Father? STEPHEN. Back againâ Even to the place I found thee in at firstâ Where life's short road, yet single, parts itself; Thy foot upon the fork 'twixt good and evilâ Paths not unlike, nor far divided, yetâ Great-hearted, ready-handed, generous, careless, With eyes intent on gloryâguileless still As that first dove, first seen in Paradise, Which Adam spared to name till taught by Eve. I say by choice inclined to good. What then? At such an age who not? This cousin of thineâ Who else like Geoffry Builth? Yet, now his feet Wade deep, through blood, toward death. MAHEL. I cared not then How soon mine followed him to such an end. His steps were lighted by the blaze he kindled. Thou first didst teach me that our feet have uses Better than those which he has turned them to. Can this prove evil to me? What dost fear? STEPHEN. The path is perilous nevertheless! MAHEL. Toward peace? STEPHEN. Where peace should be. What hedge shall shelter it? Our faith? Our universal Faith? She stands At every turn for every other use: We swear, we covenant, we traffic by her: Her name is on our lintels, door-posts, robes: Her everlasting symbols are displayed Above our cradles, tables, beds, and graves. Who questions with her? who forbears to praise her? Yet who on earth considers what she means? Her badge of mercy blazons half our shields: Sword-hilts are fashioned as memorials of it: The cross adorns stalls built for usuryâ Our hostelries have fixed it o'er the doorâ It rests on harlots' bosoms in the stews! This sign of man's forgiveness leads to battle! While every tyrant hangs its ensign out In scorn of justice from his battlements, Mailed prelates march before it to the fieldâ Priest fights with priest, and both sides under it! This sign and pledge of mercy! Should I slip The leash that yet had held theeâcry hallooâ Run, swift of foot! run first in such a race? Alas, because I spared to teach thee thus, I tremble, as I said, but not repent! MAHEL. Who calls? STEPHEN. The Lady Berthaâthen adieu! She brings the peace we seek. (Exit Stephen.) (Enter Bertha Fitzwalter. BERTHA. To one so great She would bring something better in its place. MAHEL. Better than peace is love aloneâbring love With love's best promises renewed. Behold, My greatness shall receive them on the knee! BERTHA. Fie! not to-day. MAHEL. Ay, every day. Foul love, Or faithless love, or love unsanctified Were so far wise to hide himself from grief, As that which scorns and shames him. Such as ours May meet each other coming from the tomb, Or travelling toward the altar. What would'st bring me, If neither love nor peace? BERTHA. I will not shoot With ell-long shafts at bees and butterfliesâ I dare not at thyself. I will not spend Wise words against love's lispings; and I fear To aim where they might hurt. MAHEL. Afraid of me? BERTHA. Nay, that were cowardice indeed! Not I! All feeblest things on earth have stouter hearts. The spaniel basks at large before the fire, Nor will he stir a foot of his for thine. Old as she is, the cat retains thy stool, Like Geoffrey Builth, by right of victory. Grooms, foot-boys, falconers, pass with caps unlowered: And babes, who fled the beadel's whip a mile, May run to deafen Mahel with their cries. Then why should Bertha fear him? MAHEL. Why indeed? BERTHA. Yet would she have thee feared. A common lord Made all subordinate degrees seem less: Earl Bernard's children were his servants too. But now we quit this page-like garniture, And should put on authority and awe. I would not see thee humbler than thy state, Nor less than those before thee. MAHEL. That were ill; But worse the sudden appetite o'erfed With unaccustomed sweets to gluttonyâ A newly-feasted beggar's superflux, Full-gorged and insolent. I need not use My little sceptre, like a May-day king Proud of its wreaths and gilding, to abase Irreverend eyes in lowlier playfellows. There will be time hereafter to assume Those graver looks and garments one by one. BERTHA. They may be stolen by others first. When wear them If not to day? Already the thieves break in! Hereafter! not at present! sometime hence! To-morrow, perhaps, or next day! Geoffrey Builth Abates thee scarce an hour for breathing time. He takes priority as older, stronger, More skilled, more feared, and better served than thouâ Pushes his shoulder foremost in the crowd, To hide so small a follower from men's eyes. Nay, he supplants thee at thy father's grave, And robs thee of his seat! Six months ago Would Geoffrey Builth have dealt at Brecon thus? Jostle with Bernard Newmark for his chair? MAHEL. Ay would he, had he wanted it. Hush! hush! Else must I seal those lips for charity With other pressure than of argument. Who now will love light-hearted carelessness, And unrespective valour marching on With easy gait, through webs which usage spins To snare the little legs of weaker men, If Bertha hate them thus? Builth's noisy tongue, O'erhasty as it is in all offence, Seems slow and silent matched against his doings. What land, where danger reared his ensigns highest, Has seen another nearer them? BERTHA. Good sooth, It were a potent reason to the rest For running out of sight from such a wolf, If all the beasts beside were hares and foxes. Well then, he shall be master every whereâ Ride with a mighty earl on either side him, And wear his cap in church while they stand bare! Fitzwalter was but deputy to-day, So left the feast beneath his government, And fled the hallâyet not through fear of him. He would have kept his hold at Hereford. But comeâno matterâbid the guests good byeâ We are not all too brave for modesty; So walk like those before thee. Hark! they call. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Butlery opening into the Great Hall. BarnabasâPeter the Butler, and Ralph, with other servants passing through. RALPH. The widow's eyes, to-day, were dry as mine. I fain would see so stout a leading staff In hands as strong as those which used to hold it. BARNABAS. Together they were over much for me. This leading staff was held in partnership; And she would rather grip the nether end, Than loose the whole of it. Dry-eyed, Sir Pantler! It has made mine make water many a time. But get thee to thy cellarage againâ Builth's people will have service. PETER. Wine for grooms Wine for Builth's foresters! BARNABAS. Ay, so they say. PETER. Not drink metheglin in the barbican? BARNABAS. They will no more of it; but lift their cry For Bordelais or Rhenish. Five-hooped stoops Are empty ere they well have laid the dust Of such fierce dog-day drouth and sultriness. Tis five times worse with single jacks. Send down And broach the triple-butt lodged last of all: It hath an ancient smatch of Bordilais, And sundry other kinds, beside crab verjuice. PETER. Bid Job be ready with his yokes and measures. The thirteenth table Rhenish! We jog on Towards last year's plenishment apace. BARNABAS. There needs Such thirsty haste to keep abreast their eating. Both ways the Lord of Builth does mightily; He sits beneath his tester like a princeâ Sir Philip and Sir Andrew either side him. Fain would they make the burial end of all Like meat, drink, care, or sorrow. RALPH. Hast spiced the bowls? We must have quarter-tons for buttery service. PETER. Who notched the second tale of three-score flagons? BARNABAS. I did count these, and then surceased awhile, Being out of heart and tallies. Geoffrey Builth Has got the canopy above his poll, And rules amongst the mourners merrily. He followed, since the noon, his uncle's bier; And now he fills his seat with broader haunches, Thinking no more what brought him here to-day, Than I of Hardicanute. PETER. But where is Mahel? RALPH. At prayers belike, with Stephen, in his closet. Sirs, shall I speak the truth of him, or lieâ Or hold my tongueâor how? This nursling Earl Is but a babe of two-and-twenty years. So harmless is he, artless, peaceful, patientâ Of such fair carriage, and such good report, That he is good for nothing. PETER. Why so, gossip? Because he feasts not here to-day with Builth? Fitzwalter might have done as son-in-law, But neither sons or brothers used to do: Then wherefore good for nothing? RALPH. Look abroadâ Our herbs, in field and garden, thrive the best, Connaturally with clime, and soil, and season: But sometimes well enough by cheating nature With feigned conformity, till changed indeed Through that which renders use as strong as she. So must we men, to prosper. These are times For rough and ready hands, like Geoffrey Builth's: And he who has them not should seem to have. Our new Earl's sire raised his both high and oft, But not in prayer. BARNABAS. Thou dost with all thy might, Both pray and preach 'gainst grace and godliness. Clerk Satan sits at hand to say amen! Great subterranean doctrines, Pantler Ralph! These herbs of thine are hot. RALPH. Canst answer me? BARNABAS. Not Iânor care to mix amongst such simples. Till better furnished with an ell-long spoon, I shall forbear thy pottage. If our calf Have too much milk at present in his mouth, He did not draw it from the cow that bare him, Nor has he grazed upon these plants of thine. PETER. The guests are up! hark! bustle both of ye! (Exeunt. SCENE IV. Hall of the Castle, hung with black escutcheons and banners. The guests rising as at the conclusion of a banquet. Geoffrey Lord of Builth, Sir Philip de Breos, Sir Andrew Fitzhaman, Sir Simon de la Hay, Sir Hugh, &amp;c., advance from the cross-table at the upper end to meet Mahel Earl of Brecon; Fitzwalter Earl of Hereford; the Countess Mother of Brecon; her daughter Margaret, Countess of Hereford; and Bertha Fitzwalter; followed from the end opposite by Sir Michael Brace, the Seneschal, Sir Reginald Saint Vallery, Sir Humfrey of Uske, Sir Giles, Sir Paul, and other knights. MAHEL. Thanks both to friends and servants for their love. Our cousin, the lord of Builth, Sir Philip de Breos, Sir Andrew, Simon, Hew, have hosts at Brecon: Their beds are with the prior of St. John. Others have far to ride before they sleep, And twilight shews the earliest of the stars. While d'Eyle prepares to summon all again, Fill me a cup of wine, Sir Michael Brace, That I may drink to each a happier meeting, And health till then. (Trumpets sound.) SECOND HERALD. Stand bare awhile! FIRST HERALD. O yes! SECOND HERALD. Those caps off, yonderâpeace! FIRST HERALD. O yes, O yes! All barons, knights, knight-bachelors, esquires, Frank-tenants, yeomen, villeinsâall men else Who hold their land by seizin, service, wardship, In capite, free-soccage, gavel-kind, Church-tenure, burgage-tenure, villeinage, Are hereby cited to do homage for them, Make oath of fealty, discharge their fines, Or else plead ousterlmain, and sue by livery, On St. John Baptist's Martyrdom, at noon. (Trumpets and acclamation.) (Geoffrey Builth, who had remained covered, advances.) GEOFFREY. O yes, O yes! cried lustily for heaven! And therefore largess to the pursuivants. (Throws them his purse.) We thank our friends and lieges every oneâ Both knights and knavesâwith all our heart we thank them. First, these our kinsmen by the father's side, My lord of Hereford, and gentle Mahel, Sir Humfrey Uske, Sir Giles, Saint Vallery; Then each in his degree. SIR HUGH. I will not wait For Saint John Baptist's Martyrdom at noon To swear my fealty; but on the knee Do homage now.â(He kneels to Geoffrey.) SIR ANDREW. I thought to be the first Who prayed long life for Geoffrey, lord of Builth, As Earl of Brecon too.â(He kneels to Geoffrey.) FITZWALTER. Stand up, Sir Hugh! What ill-conceited trasheries are these? A single clown, yea even a sober one, Were out of grace and welcome here to-day. Three drunken jack-a-lents, at any time, Could only mock each other. Wise Sir Andrew Plays merry-Andrew at a burial; And stout Sir Hugh a jester's supple-back! GEOFFREY. Our cousin of Hereford is cursed and crooked, Through nothing worse than emptiness. Good sooth, He would not eat nor drink with us! We three Thrive better for our meat. FITZWALTER. A fool at noon Is seldom much the wiser after supperâ And this buffoonery began betimes. SIR HUGH. Is all such service foolery, my lord? FITZWALTER. I am but slow at riddles, good Sir Hugh. GEOFFREY. Then let us help thy wits, which twice to-day Have lacked a lighted lantern. Thus it isâ My servants wish me joy as master here, Lord, both of Builth and Breconâso I amâ And will be so with leave of Hereford, Or else without it. Such I rode to churchâ The heir, and lawfully the next of kin To Bernard Newmark, buried there. As such I sat at table in the seat he left meâ His successor, his substitute, his nephew, His younger brother Roger Newmark's son. The Lord of Builth is Earl of Brecon too. Needst more illumination yet, fair coz? Or will this serve? FITZWALTER. Nay, truly, this will not. At Hereford we count men's sons and daughters As nearer kin than nephews. GEOFFREY. Do ye so? At Hereford I grant it may be thus. Ye men of Hereford dwell farther eastâ Wisdom must pass you ere it get to Builth: We catch, at best, your leavings. Hereford! I' faith ye judge aright! Sons should stand first. Yet stop! not allâwhat sort of sons? There be Diversities among them. Some men say That pilchards are the unlawful sons of herringsâ A kind of mulesâbut then subordinatelyâ Without inheritance. Why, look you, sirs, I Builth have sons and daughtersâGeoffrey Builth, As yet a bachelor, has many such. What then? My mother's nephewâhere he isâ May sometime push his little kinsfolk outâ My blood, my bone, my flesh, my boys and girlsâ Himself being next as heir. Indeed he mayâ This Philip de Breos here. FITZWALTER. What of that? GEOFFREY. Why so? Because their mothers missed the way to churchâ Forgot the priestâwere ill at making bargains. By law, they should have had a clerk at hand To give men nine months notice of their coming. Mahel was ill provided for in this. Mine uncle Bernard seemed a careful man, But here his memory failed him. COUNTESS. Lead him hence! Go, scourge him homewards! When the sot comes next, Let him be seated at the bench outside; And keep him fasting till we send for him. GEOFFREY. Special hard usage in a man's own house! The wine I drank to-day was mine beforeâ Drawn from my flasks and barrels. Fasting too! Scourged homewardâsayest thou?âwhy, I am at home. Where be these beadels, mistress What's-thy-name? I would deal tenderly with every oneâ For uncle Bernard's sake, I would do soâ But scourges on the back of Geoffrey Builth! Ah! ah! fair leman mine! DE BREOS. Have patience, sirs. Builth claims the Earldom here as lawful heir. If Mahel and his sister Margaret Were born with wedlock's blessings overhead, The proofs are patentâthree-and-twenty years Have left some records on the spot, no doubt: Ye have not far to look for them. GEOFFREY. Give roomâ If this Welsh princess Nest were Newmark's wife, Where be the vouchers, records, contracts, pacts, The priests, the witnesses, the bridegroom's fellows, The bride's companions? Who was at the feast? Who kindled bonfires on the hills? Who danced? Who swept the marriage-chamber from mishap? Ye live among your peopleâbring them forth. Marriage makes such a coil when coupling great ones, I never could go nearer than the feast. When these were born to him, Earl Bernard's pate Was grey with more than forty yearsâand he No maiden runaway at any time. What need of whisperings then, and traversings, And kissing-corners to a man like him? His brother, my dead father, thought as Iâ So do these knights. DE BREOS. I tread on no man's heels; But ask for guidance to a sure belief From written chronicles or living lips. Let Mahel bring his proofs. SIR ANDREW. I say so too. GEOFFREY. By holy Jude, I say the same myself! With all my heart I do subscribe to this. Will any honest man wish more or less? Speak out at once, boy, like thy father's childâ So far no matter for the priestâwilt bide By wise men's judgment, both sides pleading issue? Or shall we bear our difference to the king? Lastly, as best and shortest of the three, Wilt call Heaven's saints to arbitrate between us, The while we look each other in the face? Wilt do me right on horseback or on foot? There lies my gage! (Throws down his gauntlet.) MAHEL. I will await the first, The wise men's inquest, and rest there. To-morrow So strange a challenge will make mirth for all; But now the soberer half is most perplexed. COUNTESS. Will it do so? Make mirth to-morrow, will it, That Geoffrey Builth has warned thee out of doors,â Seized thine inheritance at one day's noticeâ And called thy mother harlot? Mirth, good sooth! A gracious provocation to the merry! Thyself and sister judged for bastardyâ And this sot's glove before thy face! Why, here He has a proof worth ten times all the rest; Earl Bernard's son a coward! I do begin To think thee what he calls theeâboth sides bastardâ A beggar's changeling stolen from some ditchâ Neither his son nor mine. Stoop, thou slave! Pick up the braggart's gauntlet! [Shouts from the spectators. Mahel! fie! He dares not! look, he leaves it! COUNTESS. Thrust Builth out! Who sides with me for Brecon? DE BREOS. Prithee, stand back! We shall have blood enough if this game speed. One burial will beget a hundred more. My lord of Hereford, give help! FITZWALTER. Stand off! We that are sober should forbearâaway! Let both sides keep their benches. Now, De Breos, What say'st thou? DE BREOS. That we cannot end to-night, With kicks and cuffs, a question such as this. Prithee have patience, Geoffrey, while I speak. Mahel by right has made the choice we gave him. Take up thy glove, fair cousin. (Gives him the gauntlet.) If we must fight, Let us have Heaven and day light over-head, The grass to stand upon, and next our hearts Iron mail as sound as they. Knighthood will blush, If they who sat like brethren, side by side, The earlier portion of so great a feast, Should pelt their wine cups at each other's pates, And end the high solemnity with knives! Geoffrey, sit down! My lord of Hereford, Let us debate of this with cooler brains, And meet again to-morrow. FITZWALTER. Well, Sir Philipâ I care not when we meet, or how. To-morrow? If ever Geoffrey's knighthood blush again, It will to-morrow, Sir Philip de Breos. DE BREOS. We meet In honor and unarmed? FITZWALTER. Ay, either way. DE BREOS. Let us come habited as now we are. The Earl of Hereford, Sir Michael Brace, Sir Giles, Sir Humphrey Uske, Sir Reginald, Will pledge their knightly faith against surprise? We shall have right of passage in and out? I dare trust all or either. GEOFFREY. Tarry, Fitzwalter! This challenge of the Earldom, needs it blushes? Who else need blush beside thy mother-in-law? DE BREOS. Peaceâcome away! My lord of Hereford Has promised us, and so have these. Good night! [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Chamber in the Castle. The Countess, and Sir Michael Brace, the Seneschal. COUNTESS. The Prior in his bed, Sir Michael Brace! We lose the chief of all our witnesses. Is he so sick? Speechless since yesterday? SENESCHAL. For what we want him, worse: his wits and tongue Run every way but straight. He has been thusâ Been partly thus, since Corpus Christi wake; A sevennight ere the Earl. COUNTESS. I heard of this: Then let it melt away midst harder thoughts. Well, we can do without him. SENESCHAL. Better, perhaps. Baldwin may think his duty nearer payment, And serve with greater heed. I have been bold To hint so muchâhe may become our Prior, And Luke may fill his place. COUNTESS. May!âay, and shall. There may be changes, which they guess not yet, Both higher and farther back. For all that help There shall be recompense. Who else, didst say!â Since Mahel cares not for his bastardy, 'Twere better let him keep the profits of it. Who makes the fourth? Ralph from the buttery? Luke, Baldwin, and thyselfâwith whom beside? SENESCHAL. Ralphâpantler Ralphâthe foremost of the three: His eyes do ever look which way I please; His skill is strongly building, bit by bit, A buttress here and there to prop belief. No architect nor master-mason he, But still Ralph plumbs his level workmanlike. All these will speak as I. COUNTESS. So, keep apart. As yet I cannot tell which way to lead. Follow me when I move. A trumpet! hark! Prithee make haste and look for Hereford. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Court Yard of the Castle, partly filled with Guests, Citizens, Yeomen, Priests, Servants, and other Spectators. A space in front kept clear by Barnabas, Ralph, and Soldiers. SOLDIER. Not look him in the face, Sir Pantler, why? His eyes stand straight enough for such a matter. Mahel is breathed and limbed as well as Builth: As ready in his exercises too. He would not quarrel at the feast, last nightâ But now they both are sober. RALPH. Were he drunk, And Geoffrey sober, something fair might chance: They would be nearer matched. Beside strong limbs, Light breath, long practice, wrestling, vaulting, tilting, Fleetness of foot, mastery in horsemanship, There should be two things else, Goliath of Gathâ Two better things than these. SOLDIER. A willing mind? RALPH. Stout-heartedness is one of them. Odso! Thou dost wax great in wisdom day-by-day! A righteous cause, the other. Geoffrey Builth Puts man and woman underneathâdost think A child may stop or turn him? SOLDIER. Heart and cause! If these be naught in him, we shall have peace. Thy Lord both coward and bastard, pantler Ralph? BARNABAS. More grace, if so, to pantler Ralph and me. Ralph shall stand up 'gainst any man alive, As one of themâthe first of themâand I, The next to Ralph, as both. SOLDIER. A bastard? BARNABAS. Ayâ From many generations misbegot, On father's side and mother's side, am I; And coward scarce less than he. If Ralph gainsay me, Lend me thy glove, he lies! (Trumpets.) SOLDIER. They come!âmake wayâ Give room enough. Enter Geoffrey Lord of Builth, Sir Philip de Breos, Sir Andrew Fitzhaman, Sir Simon de-la-Hay, Sir Hugh, &amp;c. on one side: Fitzwalter Earl of Hereford, The Countess Mother Margaret, Countess of Hereford, Bertha Fitzwalter, the Seneschal, Sir Reginald Saint Vallery, Sir Humfrey of Uske, &amp;c. on the other: then apart, and after them, Mahel with Father Stephen. GEOFFREY. A fair and many-sorted company! Neat-hides and Venice velvet scour each other. Beside the gentle guests of yesterday, Burghers and craftsmenâsoldiers, yeomen, friarsâ But welcome every one. FITZWALTER. We promised this: Wide gates and open ears. A toad shut up From air and daylight, lives a century: But dies when sunshine and the winds have touched it. So, for the most part, does a lie. GEOFFREY. I seek A younger toad by almost fourscore yearsâ Your lie of five-and-twenty. He shall have Daylight and air enough for such weak eyes. So patience, sirs! Ye sup with me at even: (to the crowd.) Our bonfires will be lighted by-and-bye. FITZWALTER. Now for the Marshal of this challenger. What say'st, Sir Philip de Breos? DE BREOS. That I, by choice, Would rather piece the last night's argument, However roughly, like a broken bone, Till time, with wiser handling, make it whole. But needful skill and leisure both are wanting. This we may do, my lord of Herefordâ Let us keep well abreast at setting outâ Tread tenderly awhile o'er dangerous groundâ Begin these rough roads smoothly. If we square And jostle one another by the way, So be itâthere will be time enough. GEOFFREY. Well, forward! Address thee to thy work again, good coz. I ever hate this sharpening of the tools: It sets my teeth on edge. Prithee, begin. FITZWALTER. What follows next, Sir Philip? DE BREOS. The lord of Builth Claims Brecon also, by his uncle's death, As only lawful son of Bernard's brotherâ So heir to both of them. For we shall show That Bernard, whom we buried yesterday, Both lived and died unmarried. GEOFFREY. Let them showâ This spinster widow of the man defunct, With Mahel and his sister Margaretâ That he died married, if they can, de Breos. The showing rests with them. Old Mother Church Should know the babes to whom she sent her blessing, And gave the cradle, cushion, caudle spoon. Where be her marks upon these lambsâif hers? Her seals, her sacraments, her ministry? Where be they, lord Fitzwalter? What says law? Let proof be missing when it should appear, Justice dissolves the court, shuts-to the door, And custom takes the inheritance. Sometimes They may tread roughly on some good man's toes; My soul consents not to their cruelty: But what of that? I cannot govern either. An earldom's ermine makes too rich a robe For any shoulders but the lawful ones. DE BREOS. The king would claim it if my cousin forbore. GEOFFREY. Ay, marry would heâand he will even yet Unless the one of us may step before him. Therefore we should make haste. He starts the last, And shall not slip between without a buffet. The king has longer hands, but mine are nearest: Let him beware his knuckles. I have hold, And I will keep it, though the Devil be king, Or king be Devil, Sir Philip. DE BREOS. Let me speak. GEOFFREY. Thou shalt, coz, by and by. Married! go to. My father knew a heronshaw from a hawk. Did these his knights believe in Bernard's marriage? Seven years ago they winked at it. No doubt His children were his childrenâhazel-eyed, Fair skinned, like him; left-handed cousins they be. As younger playfellows I loved them both. What said I else, last night, to give offence But that their mother sped without the priest? Am I drunk still? I say it again while fasting. SIR SIMON. We give a double choiceâtake either handle: Call up your witnesses, if such there are: Bring vouchers for belief: bid Law be seated, And choose the noblest here to arbitrate. Do something which seems honest, what ye please. SIR ANDREW. Else arm and mount the claimants. Let them meet As best beseems their place and ancestry. GEOFFREY. This Mahel when a boy surpassed his fellows. What lets him now to look me in the face? Is his heart faint? Well, bring his proxy then. Choose one amongst so many, whom ye will. Builth cares not for degrees in soldiership: Prince, earl, or baron, down to lusty Hodge; He likes the bravest best. (Builth throws down his gauntlet.) (Cries from the spectators.) Mahel! up with it! Ah, craven-hearted! will he let it lie? He turns away! he dares not! MAHEL. True, I dare not. There is another witness that I dare not, More feared than Geoffrey Builth or such as ye. His curse against blood-guiltiness affrights meâ The ever-during wrath which follows pride Forewarned of him, but heedless. Better to creep, A fugitive and vagabond on earth, Without his mark and sentence, to the grave, Than carry both so far, and one beyond it. Therefore it is I dare not. Shame like this, If sharp as death, is milder than remorse! Geoffrey has so far justice on his sideâ He asks for proofs against his own belief: He challenges what older men think his, That which his father taught him, which his knights Believed, and still believe. If breath alone May quench this flame at once, or blow it out, Supply the proofs he calls forâshut his mouth, And shame his wiser servants; shall we spare it Because his gauntlet lies upon the ground? GEOFFREY. By sun and moon, there is no more to do. Sir Philip de Breos went foremost of the three; I kept awhile behind him, then abreast him: Mahel spurs past us both the self-same way. He pleads against his earldom mightily! Bless thee, fair kinsman! As I hope to thrive, 'Twere better fight with any man alive, Or any other maid. COUNTESS. A man, dost say? That pleads against his mother, sister, self, His honor, name and lineageâall through fear! Just now, he styled himself a vagabond. This man of thine, who makes me face my judges, To clear his sister's birth from bastardy! We shall be talked to soon of beadles' whips: The strumpet's penance must begin with tears! My son is doubtful which of these to call me, His father's wife or harlot!âGentle knights, Sir Philip de Breos, Sir Simon de la Hay, Sir Humfrey, Andrew, Michael, Reginaldâ The topmost plumes of England's chivalryâ I thought myself a Countess yesterday. Which of you whispered no in Newmark's ear? Who called me harlot while he lived to hear you? You set my cup beside me, carved my meat, And rode bare-headed at my bridle-rein. Knights should not kneel before a concubine: Ye knelt both going forth and coming home. Who called me harlot to him then? By Christ, Ye dared not speak it, think it, dream it, sirs! I say ye dared not, knights and noblemen. To both the factions, Builth's and mine, I say it. Your spurs had left your heels, the hangman's axe Had spared this presence here, and answered for me. Now that I am a widow, I must quit! Your late lord's kinsman thrusts me out of doors! I plead before his servants here! His son Asks witnesses for conscience' sakeâhe is A gospeller, what not! The vagabond! I must bring hither contracts, vouchers, pacts, Or blush, and own myself a concubine. Nay, by my soul's best hope, I will not do it. Let him maintain his birthright if he please. My honor and his sister's take their chanceâ So shall his earldom too. Why should I care Whether the braggart or the craven get it? SPECTATORS. Bravely! Ah, Mahel! hollow heart! FITZWALTER. Look upâ Do thyself right and us. MAHEL. Right rests with Builth Of reclamation 'gainst apparent wrong While we hold back the proofs. MARGARET. Brother! a coward! BERTHA. Dost thou not hear thy mother? Take the glove; Ah! fie upon thee, craven! Sunk to this! Lost every way! FITZWALTER. Bethink thee yet. MAHEL. I do. FITZWALTER. Lift up the gage thenâwake! COUNTESS. Faint-hearted traitor! BERTHA. Is death so hard as this is? Shame upon thee! COUNTESS. Thou chalk-faced idiotâtake the gauntlet up! Why dost thou gasp and tremble thus? STEPHEN. Forbear! And let me speak. COUNTESS. Peace, whisperer! Thou hast spoken What rusts and rots his heart. Drive the priest henceâ Away with him! (Stephen is forced off.) FITZWALTER. Dost own thyself so base? Thou wilt not raise it? Then I will. (Takes up the glove.) Till now I had no right to it. His place is void. Two noble ladies stand impeached by Builth; My mother-in-law and wifeâas harlot, bastardâ This slave renounces them. Being next of kin, I say that Geoffrey lies. CROWD. Bravely again! Huzza for Hereford! SIR REGINALD. Had I ten swords All should maintain their quarrel. SIR HUMFREY. My single one Is freely theirs. SENESCHAL. And mine. SIR GILES. And so is mine. GEOFFREY. I take the stakes all round. Sir Philip, forbear! I will not lose the lightest of the five. It is my gameâstand back, de Breos!âby Jude! I fain would play it out with half a score! When shall we meet, Fitzwalter? What's to-day? We may bring arms by Tuesday next. At noon I will dine here with wife and mother-in-law, Ending our buffet first. SIR SIMON. For lawful lists The king must grant his warranty. GEOFFREY. What need? SIR SIMON. Already I stand Builth's sponsor three times pledged, As one of three, for more than half I have. His Grace has tightly tethered all our legs, And we must wait the loosing. GEOFFREY. Wait! Not I. He may come first, Sir Simon de la Hay. SIR SIMON. I heed not, so he frees me from my bail. GEOFFREY. Wait! what a month? SIR SIMON. Haply two months or three. My Lord of Hereford and Geoffrey Builth, I hereby cite you both before the king To keep his peace. I cared not for the boyâ No fear lest he should break it! Men are ye, And dangerous both. GEOFFREY. Then let Fitzwalter bide At Hereford the while, as I will here. Tarry for leave a month or two? I will Keep in, or get in, as I may! COUNTESS. Peace both! Throw down the gauntlet, Milo; let it lieâ Thou shall not fight for truth against herself, Nor run toward honor blindfold, Hereford. Foul breath, the wind behind us, harms us not. Sir Philip de Breos and Builth may laugh their fillâ Mahel is not the Earl. When he was born, His father was not married. Loose the gageâ Now for the mountebank and clown. MARGARET. My Mother! COUNTESS. Ay, verily, so great a thing as that! So much even still she is! Mother to Margaret! Nor over proud of being so. SIR ANDREW. Vallery's sword, Was lent to chastity. DE BREOS. A maiden loan, No danger to its innocence. SIR ANDREW. It will Need little grinding through its too much use. SIR HUGH. Sir Humfrey spake but once, and then amiss. GEOFFREY. I will be friends with every one of them. DE BREOS. We scarce have room to buffet one another, While hunted truth lies panting on the ground. GEOFFREY. Marry, we have her now by both the ears, And the brush tooâthis nimble-footed verminâ At last ran fairly out of breath. Some kinds Do stand, like bears, upon their hinder parts, Ugly great-hearted truthsâwith ready paw, Who will not budge from hottest questioners. Others, when hardly pressed, go down the wind Carrying their scent before them, badger-like. Then dodge from brake to brake, or double back, Take ground and must be delved for. Such is this. But now that we have caught her, let us hold her, And all be merry again. DE BREOS. She may not love Such handling well enough for merriment. GEOFFREY. There shall be no change here which is not good. Our cousin of Hereford must dwell content; Fitzwalter will ride homeward. Geoffrey Builth Has Brecon superadded. Gentle Mahelâ A godly and a peaceful youth he isâ Shall pray for all of us, mine Almoner, With staff and signet-ring, anointed, shaven; Within a month the Prior Saint of Johnâ He that is now such cannot hold a sevennight. SIR ANDREW. And Mahel's mother? GEOFFREY. Shall fare best of all. What wouldst thou have to do with Mahel's mother? Yea, by my Halidame! if minded so She may be profitted by that which changes, And that which needs no changingâboth ways lucky. Mine uncle Bernard's years were threescore oddâ Mine own are something more than half so many: Say thirty-six or seven. Her's scarce midway Betwixt the two, and borne without a flaw, Borne bravely so far, as I live by bread! Fitzhaman still runs first to look for strays; But she shall dwell at Brecon here with me, And fill the house with younger Mahels, Margarets. Sometimes the latter math exceeds the crop. I will maintain 'gainst him and Christendom, That no man's flower is fairer than my fruit, Ripe fruit, Sir Philip. DE BREOS. A challenge! for how long? GEOFFREY. Till over ripe. Be provident, fair coz, A fagot of dry goss may stop a gap. I need not think to marry yet, I hopeâ Not yet, de Breos! COUNTESS. They have had space enough, With time and leave, to try their archery; Void butts and ample target. One aims wide; The rest, with all their might, shoot scarce half-way. Let them choose stronger bows and longer shafts, Then prove their little skill a second time. There is a sequel to this history: Its consequence leaped first, and out of place, To meet its provocations. What speaks now May call its witnesses from standers-by. I came to Breconâhow? Who brought me hither? Whence came I, gentle knights? At what an age? Some here have heard so much at least, Sir Hughâ Was then amongst the pages. I was carried By those who left my father's house in flames; A child and captive, but a princess too, And so esteemed till womanhood. Thus long Your late Lord's sister had the care of me. Small room for choice, I trow. A hostage still, How might I marry? While my father livedâ Against his willâagainst reproof of kinâ Bestow me with his enemy? If marriage Be sacramental spousals, law would void, And holy Church prohibit such a pact. They both allow betrothals, wedlock's pledges, Its sacredness, its purity, its truth. All that we lacked, at first, were priestly blessings, And these not long: nor matrimonial faith, Its vows and mysteries at any time. This noble sister's presence, as I thought, Outweighed ten priests. I should believe so still, But that you heart-sick craven is a curse, And seems a punishment. GEOFFREY. Well, you and I Will leave the vows and learn the mysteries. So, prithee be brief. Ye cared not for the priest:â What next befel? how then? COUNTESS. He cared for us, When peace had swept the hindrances aside, In giving needful form to what had been As well without it, but for that. GEOFFREY. Ay! when? COUNTESS. Two years before the birth of Margaret. Her right is clear both this and every way. Fitzwalter is the earl on her behalfâ GEOFFREY. What priest? COUNTESS. The prior. GEOFFREY. Sick! speechless! dying! who else? COUNTESS. Your aunt, Earl Bernard's sister. GEOFFREY. Dead as Eve! COUNTESS. The prince, my father. GEOFFREY. That, and something worse! He would be long in coming whence he is. Give us a lively witnessâlet him bide. COUNTESS. I know not whoâsome seven or eight were thereâ Too many by half for what we wanted them. A second marriage might disprove the first; This pigeon-livered knave was then the heir,â We wished to keep him such. GEOFFREY. I fain would hear One witness yet unburied. SENESCHAL comes forward. So you shall. I saw this second marriage. GEOFFREY. How long since? SENESCHAL. At least, not less than one-and-twenty years. We keep no reckoning by the almanac. Being page, at that time, to the Earl deceased, I followed with the grooms.âLive witnesses? There were two priests or three, beside the prior. FRIAR BALDWIN comes forward. Lo, one is here. If challenged for the time, I should have guessed some eight or ten months earlier. FRIAR LUKE comes forward. As Sacristan, I tended on the lights. RALPH comes forward. And I kept shut the doorâmy back against itâ But hard beset, and with a deal to do. Brides-peopleâwhat! but eight? Who tells me so? No more than seven or eight? Why, ten were thereâ The little lord himself was there. GEOFFREY. Who? Mahel? Rare luck for him to see his mother married! How old didst say he was? RALPH. How old? A yearâ He scarce might stand untended on his feet, But then the nurse's finger held him upâ Her little finger was enough. Good sooth, She would come in! she needs must see the wedding! Saving this presence here, I got a kiss, The porter's fee, from both of them. GEOFFREY. This drought Ends in a flood which drowns us all! Who else? Three groats would buy such fagotted by scores. Another whispering to the last! out with him! That piebald-pated Lazerâbring him forth! He with his mouth ajar.âA censer-swingerâ Bell-ringer's deputy, or some such clerkâ He too, past doubt, was one of them. What sayest? âCome forward, Patch, and tell us what thou art. BARNABAS. A second-handed prophet. GEOFFREY. Canst foresee? BARNABAS. What Merlin did foresee, I can interpret. GEOFFREY. Then give me better luck, and let us hear thee. BARNABAS. The bloody hand casts off its glove; The carrion crow has hatched a dove; The eagle flown, a kite comes down; A flake of snow a lady's vowâ A lie can buy a silver chainâ A saint match Satan three to oneâ So Ralph shall be the chamberlain, And Baldwin Prior of Saint John. (Exit.) GEOFFREY. Some one run after him, and bring him backâ Cry largess in his ear. COUNTESS. We wrong our patience. One witness was required, and here are four. I stay no longer questions. Clear the groundâ Drive these knaves home again, Sir Michael Brace. FITZWALTER. I claim the earldom on my wife's behalf. CROWD. Brecon and Hereford! huzza! he has it! FITZWALTER. Let Builth the challenger release his bail, Then meet me singly or with whom he will. I hold his gage till Christmas come. GEOFFREY. So long? Thou shalt be fain to yield both glove and Brecon By this day month, my Lord of Hereford, Or Christmas cheer will scarcely keep thee warm. Good-bye mine uncle's widow doubly married, Therefore no maid, and yet no wife withal. Keep smiles and kisses till I come for themâ We shall not tarry long. (Exit with his Knights.) CROWD. Ah! down with Builth! The Countess Margaret! Welcome, lady! welcome! COUNTESS. Take logs and fagots, be they whose they may: To-morrow we will pay the loan of them. Build bonfires till they overlook your roofs, And, good Sir Michael, find them beeves to roast. SENESCHAL. Our barrels will run down the borough streets Ere they be ready with their stoups. COUNTESS. Make haste! No stint to-night. (Countess, led out by Fitzwalter, passes Mahel.) COUNTESS. Well, what art waiting for? A bastard token of my harlotry? Bethink thee of thy choice and calling, childâ Thrust out the vagabond! (Exit.) MAHEL. What! Margaret too! (Margaret passes.) Will she pass misery by without a look? My sister! Fare thee well then! Canst not give So small a wish as this for what I leave thee, And bid God's peace at parting? Take my placeâ But say farewell. MARGARET. Be gone to Hereford! Spur sharper than this shame to hide thyself. I will send after theeâso now away! What hast thou left, or canst leave, but disgrace? O, Mahelâfie upon thee! MAHEL. Hear me speak! MARGARET. A craven's sister! Bernard Newmark's childâ Fitzwalter's wifeâappeached of bastardy! The son forsake his mother! God forgive thee! I rather would be what I thought myself, Than what I am with all on this side heaven. Take horse to Hereford. (Exit.) MAHEL. That spark goes out! It was the last I reckoned on to light me. Fitzwalter's sister loves not like mine own. (Bertha passes.) BERTHA. Margaret can neither love so much nor hate. MAHEL. Then for the sake of that which once has been, One moment see and hear me. BERTHA. To what end? MAHEL. Not such as love might dream of. Hope is pastâ But see and hear me, Bertha! BERTHA. For the sake Of what I thought thee onceânay, think thee stillâ For pity's sakeâthy sister's sakeâmine ownâ Pray God I yet may see once again! See thee where shame and mockery grieve us notâ Scorn, if it follow, cannot reach to harm usâ The hiss drops short, and cries of Traitor! Coward! Make the pale face no paler! I would see theeâ âThat mine own eyes may witness so much goodâ Where pity may be blameless;âsee thee safe, Escaped the chidings of this infamy;â But may God's grace forbid I ever should While both of us can hear how loud it is! (She turns to the crowd, and draws a ring from her finger.) Look this way, gentle friends! Among so many, There will be some fair neatherd, goatherd, swineherd Affianced since Saint Vallentine or Yule, Who only wants a ring to bind his Madge: With wishes for its happier speed, take this. (Throws the ring amongst them, and exit.) FIRST CROWD. Who caught it, Giles? hold fast, Bartholomew! SECOND CROWD. It never touched the ground. THIRD CROWD. The better luck! RALPH. Her luck is getting loose from such an owl. Ah! hollow-heart! out with him through the gate! FIRST CROWD. Hands off him, Jacob! RALPH. Weaver, get behind! Drive out the runaway! SECOND CROWD. Nay, spare to strike! THIRD CROWD. Well, let him go then.âThrust him with the staff! RALPH. Help Builth against his mother! FIRST CROWD. Let him loose! Deal gently with him, Judeth! THIRD CROWD. Bastard! Craven! Halloo! he flies! (Mahel looks, for a moment, at the Towersâand then rushes outâfollowed by the crowd.) SCENE III. Chamber in the Castle. Father Stephen and Barnabas. BARNABAS. Leave wringing of the hands and counting rafters! What wouldst thou with me, father? Here I am. Didst send to find a comforter? Go to: Let us sit down, that we may sum the cost Of making capons for this world of cocks, This huge and smoking dunghill, whereupon The strongest beak and sharpest spur speed best. Thy chicken's-legs were tethered shrovetide-wise: So Geoffrey Builth has plucked his feathers off. Woe worth the while, good father! Thou didst light The fire which boiled his little heart to broth! Thy doctrine sweated valour fairly out, Exhaling soul and manhood drop by drop. Take comfort of me, father! STEPHEN. May He grant it Who hears and pities misery! That poor child Had patience while the rabble chased him forthâ Whooped, hissed, and cursed him through the howling streetsâ And I have none! They hunted him about! They grudged a refuge at his father's grave, And thrust him from the church! BARNABAS. Friar Baldwin did. STEPHEN. Haply he thought of malice fiercer still, And so found patience. God forgive me, faithless! I shall go mad! The same had thronged his heels Bareheaded while their caps were cast toward heaven, With shouts and songs, returning from the field; Yea, though their neighbour's bones were left behind him; Themselves nor eased nor profited! His hands Were bloodless and employed in doing goodâ Therefore they hissed and cursed him! Hear me, son. I cannot follow himâI am shut in; The Seneschal has closed the gates upon me. Seek fitter garments for his state and need: Hide him from farther malice: keep thou near him. Nay, tarry not! bethink thee where he is! As thou shalt hope for mercyâshow me this. BARNABAS. We two will do our best for one another. I take thy place as preacherâso farewell! If I can bring him back to face his mother, Or fight a main with Geoffrey Builth, I will. (Exeunt.) END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A River, and on the side opposite, a Ferry-boat. MAHEL and BARNABAS. MAHEL. What name and office, say'st thou? BARNABAS. Barnabasâ The son of consolation. MAHEL. Boat, ahoy! Help me to wake this ferryman. BARNABAS. Do cooks Bake larger warden-pies, with greater heed, On that side than on this, for love of beggars? Why should we cross the river? Think'st to freight The boat thyself, without thy miseries? Do cowards flock eastward out of heart and breath? Or do the mis-begotten address them thither? All cuckoo-kind of creatures congregate For incubation near the rising sun, To hatch them phÅnixes from addled eggs? Why should we cross this ferry? MAHEL. I would have, Between us two, as wide a stream as this, To keep thee out of hearing. Boat! ahoy! I need it but for one of us. BARNABAS. My wits Are scarce so light and loosely-packed as thine: Yet such an evocation might undo me, And blow them where thy fortunes fled before. Thou hast a windy heritageâstrong breath Wherewith to cool thy sister's husband's porridge, The while he keeps his hand upon the spoon. With entrails small as mine, through lack of use, A grasshopper could ill digest the dew, And he might shout as lustily. MAHEL. Boat! ho! BARNABAS. For which of us? and what dost call thyself? Thy name, though air, is like thy patrimony, Friends, kinsmen, servants, sister, mother, wife, Too great a thing, and much too good for thee, Though air be next to nothing. MAHEL. I have cast All these behind me, and since then have spared My cloak to barer misery than mine own. Now to be nothing is the best choice left me: My greatest grief is ever to have been! Why strip me of my patience too? BARNABAS. I need, As follower to so pitiful a lord, A double share of it. MAHEL. Why follow me? BARNABAS. A masterless dog soon tires of liberty. The whole world is at war with him. It needs I follow some one. He that was, at last, Thy lady mother's husband, as she says, Though not in time for honesty, did garnish Small commendations with a world of kicks. Thy sister's husband, with his double earldom, May double entertainment such as this, Nor look for recompense. While Geoffrey Builth In such wise deals his bounties as a king. Be it but for conscience' sake, to render back Hereditary charities like these, I fain would follow thee. MAHEL. Boat, ferryman! BARNABAS. He doth mistake thee for his next of kin, So neither owns nor hears thee. MAHEL. Should he cross, He bears thee back upon thine own report: Dogs pay no toll. My wealth will scarcely quit The transport of a man. I shall bide here. BARNABAS. A man or less, had bided still at Brecon. Our shadows may precede, may follow us, May walk beside usâbut not go without us. In things the least substantial, I present A body 'twixt the light and thy poor spirit. MAHEL. What things? BARNABAS. Our birth and ancestry. As thus thou hadst One father at the most, and he most doubtful: But one, I say, at best. Thy lady-mother Guessed thy gestation loosely: she could make No nearer reckoning than of eighteen months. Nor is she sure of theeâif his indeed. Some two or three and twenty years ago, She had, she thinks, a son by somebody: She partly does believe she had. Behold, Two nations have a part in Barnabas, And thirteen townships! His descent is not From twenty ancestors filed one by one; But twice as many fathers altogether. His lady-mother's memory was not tasked Whether she had a husband, but which was he. MAHEL. Boat! hilla ho! FERRYMAN, from the opposite side. Who calls me? what dost crave? BARNABAS. My breakfast, dinner, supperâtwo days owingâ All these are in arrear to me. FERRYMAN. Gramercy Thou should'st make haste, with such a deal to do! When all are ended, I will bring the boat. MAHEL. The one of us is ready nowâtake me. FERRYMAN. It were a sin, and scarce worth while, to part you. BARNABAS. How many dost thou count us at? Hast got Thy tallies for the reckoning? We stand here, One lord, one knave, two vagabonds, two fools, As many cowards and bastards, one great saint, And one who fasts enough to make him such. FERRYMAN. Except the saint, we have of every sortâ And him we must not covet. Let him bide To teach the others patience. [Exit Ferryman. MAHEL. By this light, The thought to quoit thee half-way after him, Is over hot! BARNABAS. Beware to caulk with wrath The vessel of thy sanctity, and daub Its seams with malice, lest combustion follow. The single property between us two In which my state proves farthest off from grace, Is this of godliness. My name is best, And best endures to own itself. My wealth Is amplest by a cloak with hare-skin lining: Our ancestry has been debated of: My wisdom stands its ground against rebuke: My valour never ran away from Fortune, Nor lost an earldom through its lack of heart: No lady-love has called her favors from me, Nor lady-mother turned me out of doors: How great soe'er the occasion, neither yet Has ever blushed for me or for herself. Let me speak truthâI do weigh lightest here! Among ten thousand mothers, are there ten With grace enough to stand, as thine has done, 'Midst servants, kinsfolk, children, enemies, And claim the credit of concubinage? Make honor out of harlotry? Alas, Such love for truth is rare! MAHEL, beating him. Cat's face, take that! And that! thou hast had notice of them. BARNABAS. Hold! I was constrained to take, but will not keep them. (beats Mahel.) MAHEL. We now shall know whose bounty spends the most. BARNABAS. Prithee forbear! MAHEL. Wilt swim the river, Patch? BARNABAS. Withdraw thine hands from off my throat! let go! May palsy prove the warmest of thy friends, And shake them from the wrists! By Dunstan's shoe, I do suspect thee now of treachery! No coward at all! I have been snared to this! Nor coward nor bastard, perhaps! Thou dost fight best Beneath fictitious banners! Boat, a hoy! Let us be quits and part. MAHEL. Away with thee! BARNABAS. The brave have beaten me by right of nature; The doubtful sometimes on their own reportâ Never a coward confessed till now! Good sooth, I shall begin to think thee wise as well! Better beat me than Geoffrey!âhave I said One word which he did not? MAHEL. Speak of myself, I heed not howâall things with human voice Are licensed thusâpies, starlings, poppinjays, Nay, even such warped and strained resemblances To much-abused humanity as thou. Coward, bastard, fugitiveâI am a post For every cur to stop atâdo thou rail, And I will strive to help thee. Honor's scorn, Love's reprobation, manhood's laughing stock, A briar to tear remembrance, him earth loathes, And heaven may find no pity for!âMine ears Will cease, at last, to ring with infamy. Deal thou as all men else doâspare them not; Only forbear my mother. BARNABAS. All men else Do not forbear thy mother; what am I To over-rule her witness of herself? Rebutt so great a lady? Art ashamed? Our large fraternity of runaways Will doubt about such membership as thine. Thou art not resolute in cowardice, Nor thorough-bred in bastardy! MAHEL. One dog, From many better fed, has left the fire And so far followed me. I pelt him home Where faith is hateful for its singleness, And every foot shall spurn him! BARNABAS. Dost repent? Art sorry? MAHEL. Ay. BARNABAS. Wilt keep thine hands in peace? MAHEL. Henceforth I willâbut get beyond their reach. Choose up the stream, or down it, or acrossâ I travel any way which thou dost not. BARNABAS. Yet take good counsel with thee. MAHEL. There is left So much of gold as makes so small a token. (gives a ring.) Bear this to Brecon. She whose pledge it was Will be thine advocate in recompense, And pay thee its escape from shameful hands. Give it as snatched and rescuedâlet it seem Not sent, but yieldedâsay the lost has left it. Thou shalt be thanked for bearing it. BARNABAS. Unless She chance to love the dog above his master, Her recompense may reach him near the tail. Lend me thy staff and let me help myself. MAHEL. Take both, and peace go with thee. BARNABAS. Peace should keep Her knuckles off my throat, and so be welcome: Fain would I leave thee patience in exchange. Thy mother's multitude of sins requires Such ample skirts with which to cover them, That charity must strip herself and starve. But while mine eyes forbear her nakedness, Wilt list to some last words? MAHEL. Ay. BARNABAS. Dost promise? MAHEL. I do on these conditions. BARNABAS. By what pledge? MAHEL. My faith and honour! BARNABAS. O! may all the saints Cherish so choice a plant, and help its growth! A medlar grafted on thy modesty! They needs must marvel at its fruits of late! I have known honor used like saffron crust To hide a stinking pasty underneathâ Have known it girt with protestations round, Like threads of tow about a linseed poultice, To keep the air from cowardice and fraud. But such a guarantee exceeds experience! Swear by thy mother's love and chastityâ Thy lady's faithâthy wisdom, manhood, fortune; Or give a mortgage on thy whole estate! Thou wilt forbear me? I have been beset By art and circumventionâhence distrust Thy cowardice as much as most men's valourâ Pawn me a saint, wilt keep thy hands at rest? MAHEL. Ayâsay and do thy pleasure. BARNABAS. So I will. It is an oath! regard it heedfully! Faith, honor, and the holy Saints to boot! Take that and that. (beats him with his staff.) We stand still! Ah, fie upon thee, reprobate! thine oath! Tarry within my reach till I have doneâ Fie! wolf's-paw! no evasion! keep thy ground! What! wouldst forswear thyself!âYea, turn But no retraction, sir! A beast am I To tie the withes of conscience round thine arms, And leave thy legs untethered! (King Gryffeth rides up armed; he dismounts. Hold! stand back: Let loose the weapon from thine hand! forbear! I say, down with it! If my wrath arise I smite thee to my feet! Away! dost hear? Forbear the youth. BARNABAS. Your knightship quits the thief To catch the constable. I do stand stillâ 'Tis he that runs away so fast. KING. What sayest? A thief? Is he a thief? By this right hand, Never was seen so strange a sight as this! What might he take from thee beside thy fleas? A spectacle so marvellous! BARNABAS. As what? A man that runs away?âif so, then never Your knightship has run after oneâwhich shows That greasy-winded valour lives at ease. KING. As there is light from heaven, I have in heart To hang thee, like a coney, by the heels! Take heed and lay the finger on thy lipâ The ground beneath thy feet is mine. Speak truth! Is he a thief? Thy son, didst say he is? If peradventure so, he fled in dutyâ Is the boy thineâthou hedge-pig? speak to meâ BARNABAS. I know not that he is. KING. Come hither, boy! (To Mahel.) Knot thou the horse's rein to yonder tree. Thou dead-cat, is he thine? BARNABAS. He may be so. He may be peradventure soâ KING. Whose else? BARNABAS. Nayânot his mother'sâthis at least is sureâ She has disclaimed him. If he had been mine He would have fled his vows before his father. I have no heart to own himâwhether or no. KING. Then, by my head, whose is he? Tell the king Whose son he is. BARNABAS. The king may claim and take him. I wash my hands of him. He is a stray On nature's waste. KING. A natural? Is it true? Now, by the bread I eat, a full-moon fool! And he so strong of limb too! Can he talk? A stately fool! wondrous well grown and featured! What dost thou feed upon? And where dost sleep? Come hither to me, innocent. Speak truthâ What meat dost eat? speak wisely. MAHEL. I did eat Ripe whortle-berries yesterday, to-day Pig-nuts and hazel-nuts. My bed last night Was where the fern grows yonder. KING. Why didst quarrel? What ground of strife? BARNABAS. There was no quarrel. KING. How? BARNABAS. The last had been made up. KING. Then why didst smite him? BARNABAS. He is a coward. KING. Ay, truly is he so! He is indeed! good sooth, thou dost speak truly! What next? how then?âdidst therefore beat him thus Because he is a coward? BARNABAS. Does your grace Believe my wit so small that I should beat him If he were not? KING. A coward? come hither, foolâ Thou shalt lift up thy face before the sun, And fight against him. Shake thyself, awake! Stand bravely to him, innocent! Behold, A king shall be thy squire! Thou dost o'ertop That pie-bald pate of his a span and half; Thy hip is well-nigh level with his beard; And shalt thou run away from him? Take heart! A brave and stately fool he is! BARNABAS. A fool To run away from me, but not a brave one. KING. By this right hand, he shall be justified! Stop awhile first, boy? BARNABAS. He must needs do that, Or run from victory a second time. I care not for his stoppingâlet him bide Till christmas, if he will. KING. Art coward too? BARNABAS. Ay, marry, am I. Were your grace as brave As I am not, we might see great things some day. KING. A coward! As light and darkness come from heaven, Never was found the man that said so yet! Hark ye! stand still! forbear awhile! speak truth! Hast seen my servant here? do thou speak firstâ A noble at the ferry? BARNABAS. I have seen A ragged sort of lord without his cloak. KING. Armed, magpieâmountedâcaptain of the hostâ The chief of all my servants! Prince ap Rhys! He rides with head on high above his crupper: His greaves are brass: upon his targe he bears A black bull chained and fetlocked. BARNABAS. Bears a bull? A mighty beast for such a little field! KING. Graven, I sayâupon his shield, thou snake! I did say graven: by my father's head I will be quits with thee! Look this way, foolâ Said I not graven on his shield? Behold, On mine are lions! MAHEL. Seven of them! KING. Canst count? MAHEL. The first is bigger than the six behind. KING. They typify the kings that rule Caermarthen: The mightiest is myself. MAHEL. They all wear crowns, And all do run one way! KING. Ayâwherefore do they? It tokens love and unanimity. I go before the rest, as first and greatest. MAHEL. Why do ye chain the bull, and loose the lions? But be they lions indeed? KING. What else didst think? MAHEL. A nest of conies, with their dam before. BARNABAS. A she-goatâIâand followed by her kids. KING. Peace, thou flayed badger's peltry! MAHEL. Hark! a cry! BARNABAS. The black bull, by his bellowing! here he is. Enter Prince Jestin ap Rhys, armed. He dismounts and kneels. KING. Stand on thy feet, Prince Jestin. What dost bring me? Give me thy tidings presently, ap Rhys. The king comes first, and tarries for his servant! The king consorts with lazars! Is it good? Beggars that lie o'nights amongst the fern; And fight, like noblemen, without a cause? Is this thing good, prince Jestin? Shout, thou fool! Cry till the earth do quake beneath thy feet; Thou godless innocent! Cry, both of yeâ The king commands the ferryman! Now speak. (Over! over! over!) What answer from my cousins, prince ap Rhys? Good news shall be requited. What says Gwinneth? Thou shalt have gold for silver in exchange. Now, where is he and Killan? PRINCE. Both a-foot. Pencarr passed round the mountains yesterday: The kings his uncle and his son-in-law Had crossed above Llangaddoc toward Penbrain. My servants travel northward through the land, By Aberath, Treegarron, Pentadarroc, To speak your grace's pleasure. I spurred fast,â But lo, the king before me! There will meet Six princes, with their hosts, at Brecon gate By dawn of day to-morrow. KING. I say, seven! As breath is life, we two will ride apace! Seven kings there will be, if I live all night. This thou shalt see, prince Jestin. Thou shalt need No ladder for the battlements, ap Rhys. The king shall go before thee. Old men say Words dropped by chance may turn to prophecies: And these were thine. I would not go behind For half Caermarthen. As we live by bread, No man shall see my back. BARNABAS. The king must go The last of all then. KING. Wherefore, Beelzebub? Lazars that sleep amongst the fernâap Rhys! Their meat is hips and haws, with such like picking. Lay thou thy finger on thy lip! The bards Do travel with the heralds in the host, To see what they shall witness and record. Hear the king speak, prince Jestin! Hold thy peace! Our horsemen are as forward as the first: Clydoge and Gryffeth lead them by the fordsâ The foot come this way presently, ap Rhys: I pricked before to meet thee. I would bring No listeners with me hither. Now, prince Jestin, The king repays thy tidings gold for brass! We have had messengers from Geoffrey Builth Who yields us all that lies this side Trecastleâ All that we asked he yields us! Art requited? Are the news good, ap Rhys? Seven kings shall aid This Geoffrey Builth to win his kinsman's earldom; And then, to take it from him, one another. As there is truth above, thou shalt not find One Northman, nor one Saxon, west of Wye On this day month. PRINCE. Both ferries are cut off. We have an easier road and abler horsesâ But we must spur all night. Earl Bernard's son Is chased from Brecon by his brother-in-lawâ Fitzwalter holds the Earldom through his wife, This bastard's sister. KING. By my father's head, And by my own, I will have both these Earldomsâ I will have Hereford as well, ap Rhysâ And Builth I will have! Whither is he fled?â The son convinced of bastardy? PRINCE. To Builthâ To Geoffrey Builth, his late competitor. But first, upon his father's grave he knelt, And swore before the altar of Saint John, That ere he polled his beard, or tasted bread, Or slept, or loosed the sandals from his feet, His hands should hang his mother. KING. So they shall! This bastard shall have leave to hang his mother, And I will hang the bastard. Hold thy peace! No man shall pity either. Princess Nest Is traitress to her kindred, prince ap Rhysâ And look, to hang one's mother is a sin. Lift up thy voice, and shout again, thou fool! Cry loudly to this ferryman. I would Have passage for myself before the hostâ So lift thy voice as doth the unicorn! A sad and peaceful innocent, ap Rhys! I spy a tear! Remember what I swareâ Thou shalt not need a ladder. BARNABAS. I would lend A long one for this purpose, if I had one. KING. What purpose? For what use? and to what end? BARNABAS. The bastard's use, and to his mother's end KING. Hold thou thy peace, and call this ferryman. Shout lustily, thou devil deaf and dumb! Bawl till thou burst thyself, dost hear? BARNABAS. He comes, And we may spare our pains. KING. By holy Herod! He shall dance nine-score cubits high this day: And thou shalt be his piper underneath, Thine ears nailed straightways to the gallows foot. (Ferryman brings the boat.) Lead in the horses; crocodile, go first. (Barnabas steps into the boat.) And lend the boy thy staff awhile. Stop! stop! Hold by the rein, thou sheep-tick, tenderly. Nowâget behind him, innocentâtake timeâ Use thy staff wisely, fool! The other followsâ Behold, I told thee so! PRINCE. Go, stand asideâ And let his highness pass thee! Get thee gone: Why dost thou push the boat from shore? MAHEL. There be Two horses and four riders; tarry awhileâ How shall we mount? PRINCE. Whither wouldst go? MAHEL. To Brecon. PRINCE. For what wouldst go? MAHEL. To see his highness fightâ See the king fight. KING. Wouldst see me fight, boy?âfie! The king did see thee run away, just now. MAHEL. That scald-pate in the boat shall be a herald, And I will be a bard. Let us both go To see what we shall witness and record. KING. So far a-foot? Ye scarce would reach in time To see the smoke, child. MAHEL. Therefore we will ride, The scald-pate with the prince upon his crupperâ And I before the king. KING. Dost think we travel, Like sheriffs, with their hangmen, to the gallows? BARNABAS. Nay, by my father's head, whose'er it wasâ We two will ride together. Let the king Mount first, and take his minister behind him. PRINCE. Bring the boat nearer, ferryman. BARNABAS. The fish Shall sup upon his carcase if he do. Address thee to thy prayersâart fit to die? FERRYMAN. The saints forbid I should be so! KING. Stand wide! Out of the way, fool! bray him on the skull! Smite him, prince Jestin, with thy leading staff. MAHEL. I smite again. PRINCE. Ah! what! before the king? Down on thy knee for mercy! KING. This is death! It is rebellion, which is witchcraft, prince! Draw thou thy sword, and bring his head before me. (The Prince fights with his sword, Mahel with his staff.) Slay him, prince Jestin! Cleave him to the chine! Make carrion for the foxes of him! fie! Down with him, prince! BARNABAS, from the boat. Another such as that! Right 'twixt the black bull's horns! Now, innocent! KING. By this right hand, the prince goes back! What! ah! Chased by a beggar's flea!âhold up thine head! Stand to him! smite him! split him to the fork! Fie, fie! then will I do it. (King draws, and both attack Mahel.) BARNABAS. Now for bastards! By this right hand a marvellous spectacle! Two princes armed against a naked fool! Let majesty lay on with all its might! But keep in front, both! Would the Bards were here! Fair play, most potent princes! FERRYMAN. Jump ashore, And help thy fellow. BARNABAS. That was well delivered! The bull has had the mallet 'twixt his horns! Now, rap the lions till they roarâlay on! They reel, the beasts grow giddy! Bravely craven! A marvellous spectacle of one to two, And wood to iron, and cowardice to valour! FERRYMAN. It is the king himself! It is his grace! Look, here is treason! Call thy wolf-dog off!â Let us row back and leave them! BARNABAS. Tarry awhile. See, royalty grows scant of breath! Well done! Legitimacy staggers! Fie, prince Jestin! That road runs wide away from Brecon gate: The bull is on his knees. Huzza! for fools! The greatest lion of seven is on his haunches. MAHEL, (to Ferryman.) Out, web-footâjump ashore. BARNABAS. Take thou mine office, As son of consolation. I the while Will do my best in thine to cross the ferry. MAHEL. This water-rat has kept us half the day, And we will keep him here the other half. Reach me an oar! The king must lend his horses, And we must ride all night. BARNABAS. Pull bravely, boy! Make haste across the river. Just in time! Behold the royal standards! Here they come! Dost hear the trumpets?âpull away! MAHEL. Make haste! Row straight to landâthen sink the ferry-boat. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Daybreak. A hovel covered by treesâunder the walls of Brecon. Mahel and Barnabas fastening their horses to the rack. MAHEL. The fog-encumbered valley slumbers yet: But higher along the mountain sides, from cots And sheep-folds, where the misty light dawns earlier, The wolf-dog rages, and the neat-herd's call Yells eagerly. BARNABAS. The upland is astir. Through lack of spurs we almost lost the race! A little longer had been just too late. Daylight and Geoffrey Newmark come together. MAHEL. An hour will bring them both. Art resolute? The taches of our purpose hold they fast? Or have these rough roads, travelled in such haste, Shook memory till they gape? BARNABAS. If memory lodged Next neighbour to the saddle, she had fared No better than her tenement has done; But dwelling higher, she 'scapes. MAHEL. Then mount again: Ride to the city gate and through the streets, Like one whose horse's heels are chased by death. Fill all the way with criesâawake the castle With blasts so eager on the warder's horn They shake his battlements. BARNABAS. Go toâwhat else? MAHEL. Watch while the giddy hearers arm themselves; Then whisper Stephen that I need him here, And, with him, his spare amice, belt, and cowl. There will be running both waysâout and inâ Knights, billmen, bowmen, pilgrims, pardoners, friarsâ The country round must send its fugitives; And some, whose home is on the safer side, Will venture forth in search of friends endangered: So shall I pass unmarked. BARNABAS. Wellânow to breakfast. [Exit. MAHEL. Again at home! I scarce asked this of Heaven, Which grants me so much more than this. I bring An offering to the offended Spirit within; It may be health and safetyâif not these, No shameful death at least. May God forgive My sloth and laggard hopelessness! I seemed A fugitive beyond the eyes of Heaven, And thought that He too left me. O, coward in heart! O thou of little faith, and base indeed Beyond the imputed infamy! So soon Apostate from his love who tries so gently! Remember yesterday, when hope turned back, And carried patience with her!âMillions live, Eating in thankfulness from day to day The bread He gives who careth for their need; I never lacked but once. Why, yesterdayâ No longer back than yesterdayâI looked On mine own shade as if it dodged to mock me, And every step seemed one pace more from peace. The dawn to-day beholds me here again, A reed sore bruised, yet not unfit for use. To-morrow, perhapsâbut this is arrogance! Best quit the thoughts of it! If shame still live, I may not live to hear itâif it perish, There will be some that say âWe judged amissâ He was not what we thought of him.â They wake! Bells, horns, and trumpetsânow for father Stephen! [Exit. SCENE II. Castle HallâAlarm Bells ringing. The Countess, attended. Fitzwalter. Stephen. Barnabas. Knights and Soldiers. COUNTESS. If this be falseâand I distrust thee yetâ(To Barnabas.) Thy last lie hangs thee. FITZWALTER. He brings vouchers with him: His horse's furniture is starred with gold, His horse a stately one. COUNTESS. Didst steal him, sirrah? BARNABAS. I did; and may be hanged for worse than lying: A gibbet beckons, turn me as I please. Seven kings are up as constables. Good father, The saints in glory look upon thy face! Unless my heavy sins might break the rope, 'Tis time I should confess to thee. STEPHEN. Out, ape! The sheriff's deputy will shrive thee bestâ I wash my hands of such. FITZWALTER. Yet hear him, friar! Haply the chips of sense he scatters round May pay for picking up. Our hands are full.â Let Nicholas keep the bridge. Run, good Sir Giles, Look to the river-gate and stable-posternâ Saint Vallery shall ride forth. Better be ready, Whether we fight or no. On Tuesday last, Both ferries were cut off, and, father west, The mountain roads all stopped. Now, where is Jacques? Go, bid the armourer send my lightest helmâ Then hush those bells and trumpets. (Enter Ladies Margaret and Bertha.) Help at hand! What place shall these fill? COUNTESS. They were best in bed. FITZWALTER. A kiss for early risers. Frighted sleep Has swept before his wing the rose away, Or else their cheeks have left it on their pillows. Do brave men's daughters tremble thus? Sir Paul, See that the burghers crowd us not. Look out, But keep this side the barriers. MARGARET. Prithee stay! FITZWALTER. I must, for lack of time to run away. [Exit. COUNTESS. Call the knave hither that has brought such news. His answers have been hinted by our fears. I will know more from him, or credit less. Now, which way went he?âOh!âcome nearer, sirâ When was it that you parted from your lord? BARNABAS. Since yesterday. COUNTESS. And where? BARNABAS. This side the ferry 'Twixt Llandegwad and Vawr. COUNTESS. And why didst quit him? BARNABAS. He quarrelled hugely! COUNTESS. What about? BARNABAS. Our placeâ The old world's questionâwhose should be preferredâ Precedence and priority by rightâ Our own, and our progenitors. I said That both of us were bastards, he and I Recorded and renowned as such. So far I granted parityâbut still maintained That his estate was farthest off from grace. The deep foundation laid I built with proofs, And plastered all with arguments. The kite Flies far, and bears the quarry to her nest. The cormorant feeds her chickens ere herself. The bitch-wolf licks her cub. The adder draws Her worms from forth the dunghill to the sun. The witch that breeds with Beelzebub affords To every imp a teat. If milk had failed, My mother would have suckled me with blood. On her side, therefore, stands my stool the highest. His drove him out, and starved the vagabond! Three days he has lacked bread. But truth is dear! Its price was twenty buffets on mine ear. BERTHA. Didst leave him with such comfort? BARNABAS. He had other: There was at hand rare store of hips and hawsâ Brakes hung with blackberries; and nigh to these Most royal company. MARGARET. Who else was there? BARNABAS. King Gryffeth, with the captain of his host, Whose horse I borrowed. They come here afoot. COUNTESS. Answer me, sirrah, ere I call for whips. Didst cross this ferry first? BARNABAS. Before the kingâ But with his horseâso mounted, and rode on. COUNTESS. Gryffeth's confederate!âGet thee to thy fellows: We two shall talk again. [Exit, leaving Margaret, Bertha, and Barnabas. MARGARET. Thou didst forsake, And dost belie thy master, Barnabas. 'Twere easier credit all the rest than this. A traitor too! BERTHA. But why not credit this? The younger born is like his elder brethren. Slight paleing parks in honor: baseness builds An easy stile for guilt. MARGARET. Cruel to say it! I cannot, and I would not, quite forget When he, the gentler, kissed my tears away, 'Midst petty griefs and childish wilfulness! Now even the last has left him! Mahel lack bread! My brother! God forgive me! BARNABAS. One repents. BERTHA. The other has repented long ago. BARNABAS. Ay?âwhat? BERTHA. Only her better thoughts of him. Greatly so much, indeedâbut this is all. MARGARET. Believe it not: her heart and tongue have quarrelled. Let the cheeks testify in such a difference. What blights and blanches them but love and pity? What drowns the lamp of those proud eyes with tears? Why are her lips sucked in and pressed together, But that she fears a sigh might pass between? Trust me that Mahel's groans are well avenged. BARNABAS. Behold, I give thee grace and breathing time. Art sorry?âDost eschew these cruelties? Be humbler, or I prophesy against thee! What Merlin spake shall fall! BERTHA. Better make haste, Lest otherwise what I foresee chance first, And ill befall which Merlin recked not ofâ That whip the Countess threatened. BARNABAS. Thou hast saidâ Therefore die stubbornly, and yet afraid; Die young, die broken-hearted, die a maid. While angels guard the just, the gentle guide, Let Satan sit upon the lap of pride Barebreached, with scorn and spite on either side. Take back this ring: it once made one of twainâ Such ill-joined halves are now made two again. Thou shalt repent and grieve; but both in vain! MARGARET. He sent it to her thus? BERTHA. No matter howâ Or who the ambassador. MARGARET. He had none elseâ So soon to quit, why didst thou follow him? BARNABAS. By provocation of the lazy spirit, To drive his manhood home again. Poor fool! He looked for mercy in a world like this! The ring itself was spared to charity. âIts rescue from disgrace will buy thee thanksâ Thou wilt be praised for bearing it,â he said: âI have but this with which to do thee good.â Rather than ask such favor, let the dogs Eat what they will of me. I would desire A dunghill for my sepulchre, and die Three times of kicks. Enter Fitzwalter. They comeâSaint Vallery first, The Lord of Builth an arrow's flight behind him! Our fields are rank with onion-eaters' breath. Wouldst see us fight these Welchmen, Margaret? Then mount the gallery stairs: yet hide thy face! Ware bolts and quarrels! One such eye as thine Is well worth two such castles. Just in time! MARGARET. So Barnabas speaks truth? FITZWALTER. To breakfast with himâ Then show his cap above the battlements: These Welsh may think that brains are under it. Let some one seek the Countess. Prithee, Sir Giles, Look to the drawbridge windlassâkeep it clear; If these our guests from Builth be not too many, We will go forth and meet them. (trumpet) What is this? Enter Seneschal. They send a trumpet to the gate, my lord. FITZWALTER. How far before them? SENESCHAL. He is close at handâ Their foremost ranks are marshalled on the butts, A double bowshot from the battlements. FITZWALTER. What knights can'st count among them? SENESCHAL. Seven or eight; Followed, I think, at least by threescore spears. The rest are guessed at by the ground they fillâ Some eighteen hundred footmen, perhaps. FITZWALTER. Eighteen? Live rags, for Michael Brace! SENESCHAL. They keep their files, And march beneath their banners orderly. Others are following by the tilt-yard wayâ No rabble, trust me. FITZWALTER. Find the Countess first: Then bring their herald hither, Seneschal. Enter Countess. O, here she comes! This crazy-pated groom We thanked so roughly for his news just now, Has proved most wise and provident of all. He gives an hour which scarce seems long enough. Geoffrey is punctual, but too late. Our cousin Is present with us here by break of day; But lo, the door is barred! So now for heraldsâ We shall be summoned lawfully! Enter Seneschal with Sir Philip De Breos. FITZWALTER. De Breos! Philip de Breos our guest again! He needs No trumpet for his welcome. DE BREOS. Gently pledgedâ I should be welcome, since I come for peace: Peace first if possible. FITZWALTER. If notâwhat else? DE BREOS. But gentle usage till I turn my back. FITZWALTER. Thus much is safely yours by right, Sir Philip. The peace you bring so swaggers in her gaitâ Is plumed and harnessed in so new a fashionâ Has company so strange to her and usâ That we must needs distrust her. DE BREOS. For her sake We borrow largely from our own estate, And having all, yield half. The Earl of Brecon, Whose father's brother died a bachelorâ Stands yet before his gates, with friends enough To break them, if he please, or overleap. But rather would find other friends withinâ My lord Fitzwalter chief of themâhenceforth His guest and brother-in-law. FITZWALTER. His brother-in-law? My wife is not his sister. DE BREOS. But your sister May be his wife: both claims be satisfiedâ Cuffs change to kissesâhe become the host. FITZWALTER. What says this sister? BERTHA. Brother, what about? FITZWALTER. Sir Philip's suitor and his choice. BERTHA. She says, His seeking may conduct him to the stocks, Though not his choice. He seeks an earldom too! The greater sot this Lord of Builth may be, The greater need his nearest friend were sober. Alas, are both alike? FITZWALTER. Ill wooing, de Breos! DE BREOS. Then best by proxy. COUNTESS. Geoffrey seeks great things Of those who, if they would, have none to give. Our lands and lordships here are not for barter. My servants hold them yet! DE BREOS. Three Earls even still! A jointure lord in petticoats. FITZWALTER. Adieu: Go tell this bachelor outside the gates, That if his Welshmen carry off one goose, Or pluck one leek with which to season it, His purse, though all too short for such a debt, Shall make it good to me. DE BREOS. This will I do, And bid him show the greater haste to woo. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Chamber in the Castle. Mahel and Stephen. (Mahel rising from table.) Enough of both kinds. They who fast so long, Should feed more sparingly than I have done. The swine-herd prodigal that lived on husks, Might die of change and surfeit. Who so swift In squandering goods as I have been? All lost! Yet trust me, Stephen, not through riotous living. Old honor's spendthrift seeks his father's house. STEPHEN. It is his own:âhis father went to meet him; And if the music and the dance are missed, He finds glad welcome nevertheless. My son Brings neither dread of heart nor shameful tears: But these to all that hate him! He shall have The benediction which belongs to peace. MAHEL. I have had more instead of it:ânot peaceâ That never must return to me again, Till death shall bring it with forgetfulness. Nor have I prayed for it this side the grave. STEPHEN. Honor, not death, shall bring it thee. MAHEL. I thought On honor once as misers think on gold: It was my hope, mine idol.âGod forgive me: I cannot quite cast out this covetous spirit! Why should I care for honor? What am Iâ Coward, bastard, vagabondâto think of honor! I asked of Him for patienceâand endured To make reproach the garment next my skin, Living in fellowship with infamy. Scorn galled me like a hair-cloth. I have known The shame, and who proclaimed it tooâfie on theeâ Even from the lips I loved! All else is gone Almost beyond my wishes. What I asked, Besides this patience which has well-nigh failed, Were truth and justice from the just and righteousâ And I believe he grants them me. STEPHEN. He does! Thou wilt not falter in a race half won, And leave its crown behind thee? Patience still! He and his peace are with thee. MAHEL. I am patientâ A patient vagabond, or what they willâ Coward, bastard, runawayâand yet repent not. If Geoffrey met me on the mountain top, And mocked me there, I would again turn from him. With fifty miles between, by day and night, I heard the cry from throats as loud as hisâ âOut with the cuckoo from another's nest! Coward, bastard, hollow-heartâah! fie upon thee!â From children idling at their mother's door, In every lane, I heard it. Like Cain's curse It crossed the mountains after me. My brain Was grown so hot and giddy with its din, I fancied speech and laughter everywhereâ The dumb beast mocked me:âtwice I stepped aside To strip my doublet off, and look behind it, Whether the words were written on my back. I have been patientâbut I would not die, And leave a felon's name for jests and proverbs, Rounding the drunkard's song with ribaldryâ âMothered like Mahelâbase as Bernard's son!â They are so hotly branded on my heart, That only death can cool it. Honor now? Who shares it with meâmother, sister, bride? I crave God's mercy in the world to comeâ In this, no more than justice. STEPHEN. Hark! they come. MAHEL. Halloo! the hart is up! We must not wait This Barnabas all day. STEPHEN. Tarry! sit down! MAHEL. The nearest cry is oursââHurrah for Brecon! (tumult heard) Brecon and Hereford!â This Barnabas! I pray thee look abroad for him. STEPHEN. Sit still!â Till eyes and tongues have business of their own, He creeps aloof from them. MAHEL. I may lend help To keep my neighbour's gate against a thief? Here is no private malice? I may fight For Bernard Newmark's houseâFitzwalter'sâMargaret's? The bastard for his luckier brother-in-law? So much is lawful to me? STEPHEN. I myself Would help to push the foremost ladder down, Being what I am. MAHEL. Those shouts are out of doors! âBuilth! Lord of Builth and Brecon!ââBravely answered! Now they are at it! Prithee, Stephen, haste! Bring me the arms I told that laggard ofâ Thou canst not fail to find themânext the doorâ A crestless helm, and shield unheraldedâ By much too heavy for the groomsâquick! quick! This cry has many tongues. STEPHEN. It will grow yet. Didst ever wear this harness?âis it known?â Has any seen it on thee? MAHEL. Once in sport, But long ago, I proved its weight and fitness. Then was I gay with gold and blazonry, As Brecon's heirâmy mother's lawful son. This rust-gnawn suit has hung uncoveted. Let it hold now, and ere the sun goes down, Some that have helped to hiss me out of doors May listen to the music that they taughtâ âCoward, runaway!âfie on thee, hollow-heart!â Now Geoffrey meets the craven face to face! He shall not see my back againâCome in! This squire at last. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Castle Hall. Tumult heard from without. The Ladies Margaret and Bertha. BERTHA. The gallery casement looks beyond them nowâ Not on, but over them. MARGARET. Their cries sound nearer. Enter Sir Humfrey of Uske. SIR HUMFREY. We lose the barriers to them. MARGARET. Beaten back? BERTHA. Lost ground so soon? SIR HUMFREY. Keep from the lattice, ladies! Call down the Countessâwe shall need good eyes To follow where the cross-bow shot have sped. Some must go home, no doubt, 'twixt rib and rib. BERTHA. The barriers lost? SIR HUMFREY. We cannot hold them wisely, So yield them freely. There our loins are bare: We scarce count one to five. MARGARET. Then come within. SIR HUMFREY. There will be work for ladies by and by: Have napkins ready. MARGARET. Why not keep inside? BERTHA. Counsel my brother soâwhy not, Sir Humfrey? I do abhor this shaking of the head! Come in, and shut the gates. SIR HUMFREY. My lord would laugh Whoe'er might counsel him:âindeed he would, Yea, though the wisest of our captains willed it, The lady Bertha stamped her little foot; Seeing that the vantage ground lies out of doors; The space being not too wide for those who keep it, Where twenty knights, at most, may fight in front, He would bide there. Meanwhile, have wine at hand: Such heavy work breeds thirst. MARGARET. Hast seen the earl? I pray keep near to him, Sir Humfrey Uske! Sir Reginald Saint Vallery has promised, And good Sir Giles. Trust me, I will be grateful: He is too hot. BERTHA. Nay, let him keep behind. Fitzwalter will not have him for a nurse. Three gossips are too many. Stand aloofâ Or if he stumble, set him on his legs. Till then fair play, and afterwards, Sir Humfreyâ SIR HUMFREY. I would have ten such sisters, if I might; And one such wife. BERTHA. A wife? as which of us? SIR HUMFREY. The bravest, surely: which is best and fairest, The good and fair may better judge than I. Whate'er betide the Earl, I cannot aid him. My present charge is in the barbican; Or else I had not tarried here so long. (Enter Soldier.) SOLDIER. Saint Vallery will be lost! The lord of Builth Has left to some behind his picking up, And leaped a rood this side of him. (Exit Sir Humfrey.) MARGARET. Come back; Grant me one moment with thee, friend. SOLDIER. Not nowâ My lady must not hold me!âwe give way, So mixed and tangled with the men of Builth, That Geoffrey may come first. MARGARET. Where is the Earl? SOLDIER. Even farther from the gate, than some he fights with. He has Sir Philip de Breos in front of him; So will not budge one inchâbut hinders usâ While he bides there, we cannot lift the bridge, Nor loose a bolt. Builth stands 'twixt him and us: No man may face this devil who means to live! (Cries.) MARGARET. Hark! Builth and Brecon! SOLDIER. That is Geoffrey's cry! MARGARET. Where is it? in the court yard? SOLDIER. Here he isâ They all come in together! we are beat By over-fighting. [Exit. MARGARET. Where were best to hide in? BERTHA. I will not hide me any where. (Enter Barnabas.) BARNABAS. I will. Being lowly-minded anywhere may serveâ The chimneyâdust-holeâor the scullery-sink. This third-part Earl eats up the other two; So now for peace again. The lord of Builth May take his earldom from Beelzebub! I have known many skilled in braining helms, But none like him. BERTHA. Those shouts seem farther off. Hast seen the Earl? BARNABAS. Which of them? BERTHA. Hereford. Enter Countess and Seneschal. SENESCHAL. We can bring later news of himâhe speeds As we would pray. COUNTESS. Fitzwalter's wife a coward? BARNABAS. Ay, and his sister too. BERTHA. Who shouted âBuilth! Brecon and Builth?â MARGARET. We did believe all lost. SENESCHAL. Faith, all was almost lostâwe thought as you. I would have bought a sheep-cot east of Wye With two or three such earldoms. Geoffrey Builth Had gained the bridge and second fortilege: His cry was in the courtâawhile he stood This side the archway! BERTHA. Where was Hereford? SENESCHAL. At buffets with de Breos. We might have shut Both factions out of doors, and turned the key, But could not choose between them. BERTHA. Geoffrey Builth! Did he give ground? COUNTESS. Ay, step by step he did. He reeled, and backed away again. Canst tell Who smote so furiously on Geoffrey's helm? First stopped, then turned him? Whosoe'er he be, He saved the House. SENESCHAL. I could not see his badge. COUNTESS. His place was ever foremost, or alone: And still he cried, âBuilthâCravenâRunaway!â SENESCHAL. He lied, indeedâbut Heaven forgive him that. The lord of Builth has found no match to-day So near as he. COUNTESS. Send some one after him: Seek him and bring him hither. Sir Philip de Breos! (Enter Fitzwalter with de Breos.) FITZWALTER. This second time he comes against his will: No wooer by deputy, nor covenant-maker. He will give ransom measured by his worth, So gold both handsful. I can rate him best, Who paid for him with such a deal to do. DE BREOS. We lose a busy hour while others work. The lord of Builth and Brecon brings my ransom:â He is not far behind us. SENESCHAL. He came first; But could not keep his holding here. FITZWALTER. Who says it? Came first?âis it true?âwas Geoffrey here indeed? I did hear some such rumour 'midst the dinâ Who turned him out again? SENESCHAL. His footing failed him. Stunned by so loud a hammering on his ears, He lost his breath, and staggered forth down hill, Du Chastel after him. FITZWALTER. Good riddance then! He leaves the bearer of his brains to us, And is where he began an hour ago, The farther side the barriers. Boy, bring wine: The while we live together, we are friends: I pledge Sir Philp de Breos. COUNTESS. Such brains as his, With only such a hand to wait upon them, Were short equivalents for what we lose! FITZWALTER. What do we lose? how so? COUNTESS. Saint Vallery. FITZWALTER. Good bye, Sir Reginald Saint Vallery! I was about to say, with all my heart! As being the better soldier perhaps, he thrust Ten times to day 'twixt me and Geoffrey Builth. MARGARET. I could forgive him worse despite than that. No matter which weighs heaviest, buy him back, For Bertha's sake, whose knight he is. FITZWALTER. With what? MARGARET. Sir Philip de Breos. The exchange of foes for friends Is profit every way. BERTHA. Let Builth keep both. Such potent feeders will make short the siege. FITZWALTER. I fain would show them both how much I love them. Sir Philip, go backâand send me home Saint Vallery. The largest bowl, boyâbear it with de Breosâ Shall Geoffrey say he fought the worse through thirst? Tell him to drive his followers farther back, And that he may expect me. [Exit Sir Philip de Breos with Page. Now this gloveâ The gage he left with us?âlast night I saw itâ It was upon my helmet yesterday. Go, find the armourer, Jaques, and look about. Walk hither, Seneschal. [Exit with Seneschal. Enter Ralph, leading in Mahel whose visor is closed.] RALPH. Wouldst slip the couples? Nay, let the ladies look upon and praise thee. In with thee, Gog Magog, and show thyself. Prithee, abate this bashfulness! It tasked My wood-craft to surprise so shy a stag! Wouldst herd amongst thy fellows out of sight? Dodge and trot off again? COUNTESS. He had no fellows The last time that I saw him, Pantler Ralph; Nor fellow nor followerâbut went straight and singly. The only deer were we. RALPH. What name dost bear? Marryâhis visor scarce may hide his blushes; I should not marvel were the iron red hot. Up with it, simple one. The beaver laced? Thou canst not raise it? MARGARET. Peace! a trumpetâhark! (Trumpet.) COUNTESS. Then Geoffrey sends his challenge to the gate. I scarce may spare the leisure now for thanksâ But whom dost serve? MAHEL. My lady, if she pleaseâ A houseless frankling since my father's death, So poor withal, I have lacked bread of late, Yet faithful nevertheless. COUNTESS. I trust and take thee. Some that began my soldiers now wear spurs. RALPH. Down with thee, Gideon. MAHEL, kneeling. I am all too base For honor, lady. On a head like mine If fallen, it could not settle. I would ask A better-sorted boon instead of it. COUNTESS. What is it?âspeak quick! MAHEL. Fair thoughts in time to come. Since honest service seems not always such, Till I transgress of malice let me hold A large forgiveness, cleansing all offence; That so my duty may begin anew Both free and pure. COUNTESS. Well prayed! I promise it. Come with me, Ralph. [Exit. MARGARET. My mother spake the first: I must not share these services to come: The past are mine, as well, for recompense. Fain would I crave the present hour between! One hour which wastes its moments while I speak Might purchase for thee honor, which would last As long as life, or longerâhouse and lands, With what thou wilt to boot. Darest do again That which thou hast done freely once to-day? Darest face this Lord of Builth a second time? May Heaven forgive me, coward and thief!âI stole His gauntlet from the helm of Herefordâ And now would hire the risk of cheaper blood! But darest thou do it freely? MAHEL. I have dared A worse thing than his face. MARGARET. What was it? MAHEL. Shame! All things are light and easy after that! Give me Builth's gage. MARGARET. Run to the barriers with itâ Be thou before Fitzwalter there! Yet stay, If thou hast wife and childrenâGod forgive me! 'Bide here, and let it lie! BERTHA. He may forgive; Fitzwalter never will. MAHEL. Is pride as great As mercyâwhich is infinite? If so I dare not ask this proud man's sister aughtâ Yet would I have her prayers. BERTHA. I need them allâ All are by much too little for my need. What wouldst thou have that I may give beside? MAHEL. A knight would ask what such as I must not. And yet it seems ill-suited where it is; Ill-sized, ill-placed; so loose, it twice has fallenâ The ring I see. BERTHA. The ring?âfallen twice, didst say? I knew not that I dropped or picked it up. Wouldst have the ring? A knight might not have asked it: Thou being no knightâbecause no knight, shalt have it. The swine-herd has its fellow-ringâI gave The swine-herd that, and this I give to thee. (Exeunt.) SCENE II. The Barriers. Geoffrey Lord of Builth, Sir Philip de Breos, Sir Hugh, Sir Simon, &amp;c., with Sir Reginald Saint Vallery, Page, and Soldiers. GEOFFREY. Ay, Lord Fitzwalter and his sister tooâ I win them both with Brecon. Largess, boy. [Gives money to the Page. Take the bowl home again, Sir Reginald: It will be readier when I call within. Fitzwalter is our cellarist: go tell him That we will recompense his love and service. Hold up the head and march! [Exit Saint Vallery with Page. DE BREOS. Saint Vallery's helm Sits heavy and awry. GEOFFREY. Droops dexterwardâ The side I canted it. Ere, that huge hind Had ceased to swing his iron flail about it, He made mine chime so emptily, I feared The brains were out. By all the many oaths King Gryffeth swears with when his heart is vexed, He shall account to me. DE BREOS. Which shall, fair cousin? Gryffeth does nothing, and the hind too much. This king of six is missing. (Trumpet sounds). Here they comeâ Fitzwalter's trumpet. GEOFFREY. Void the ground! give room! And mark me, sirsâthe castle is our ownâ As surely so as if the roast were carved, And we at table supping in the hall. Without Fitzwalter 'tis an empty shell; And he bides here. If any come between To botch this work of mine a second time By drawing help on either sideâye hear me? Sir Philip, strike him dead! [Enter Fitzwalter, Saint Vallery, Sir Giles, &amp;c. Fair cousin, a match:â Whichever is the Earl, he will need friends; So let us keep our servants for to-morrow, And work to day ourselves. FITZWALTER. 'Tis ordered so. Stand back, Sir Giles; I prithee keep away. GEOFFREY. The longest liver is the Earl of Brecon? FITZWALTER. I cannot wager with another's wealth: My wife must be the Countess. GEOFFREY. So she shall, With all my heart, if mine. I take her too. Now for the widow! (They fight.) DE BREOS. Off, Sir Reginald! Keep the lists clear behind there! SIR HUGH. Higher! strike higher! Give room enough! SIR GILES. Then drive those muttons hence. DE BREOS. Fought bravely both sides, and well matched! SIR GILES. Stand wide! SIR REGINALD. Philip de Breos is nearer now than we are. On either part, small odds! SIR HUGH. That makes the difference! SIR REGINALD. Ah! his foot slips! Fitzwalter! GEOFFREY. Yield thee, cousin. Let the sword loose, and then away to Builth. I haste within as comforterâlet go! [Enter Mahel, who beats back Geoffrey; both sides come up; Fitzwalter is rescued, and his knights retire with him. MAHEL. Take breath, my Lord of Builth. GEOFFREY. Away from him! Philip, stand back, and clear the ground again. No matter for the Earl of Herefordâ Our brand-mark is upon himâI shall find him! Fitzwalter will not fight again to-day. He bides as safely ours within, as here. Let the stag hide awhile. This witch's wolf, Who sped the better through my loss of breath, Comes in good time, the next. By holy Jude, He called me craven too, and runaway! I would redeem him at the gallows foot! With half I have would buy him from the rope, Rather than quit or miss him! MAHEL. Prithee peace! I cannot give thee breath against thy will, Or such a will to waste it. We shall hear Of some mischance again. GEOFFREY. There has been yet So much of exercise as does me goodâ It breathes and warms me. Look about thee, cuckold! Fight bravely, buffalo!âit is with him Who never turned aside from what stood next, Be it knight or knave. Art ready, leaden-fist? (They fight.) DE BREOS. Give space enough, Sir Hughâhe looked for deathâ Let him not miss it. SIR SIMON. Hew him to the fork! Ah! short!âthen where the halter should have been! DE BREOS. By sun and moon, he bears him masterly! Fair play behind there!âfie, Sir Simon Hay! His luck is one to twelveâso room enough. SIR ANDREW. Down with him, Builth and Brecon! bravely struck! Fore Heaven! he is a master of his craft! DE BREOS. Ah! keep upon thy legs, good cousin of Builth! Farewell to knighthood if our grooms fight thus! Down! Builth is down! forbear a space. [Geoffrey is struck on one knee. MAHEL. We fight In honor, Lord of Builthâso breathe awhileâ I give what I would take. GEOFFREY. Wilt rest, or how? MAHEL. Ay, while Sir Philip keeps the ground so justly. I fain would rest this sevennight. Why not part With breath enough to serve us home again? GEOFFREY. I rather would die here, than live and leave thee. Both never will go home again, or hence. A grave is digged behind for one of usâ Which first draws back, drops in. My bed is madeâ I sleep in yonder castle all night long, Or in the church a hundred years and odd. 'Tis Brecon now or nothing. (Mahel throws down the gauntlet.) MAHEL. Let the gage Lie there till one or other pick it upâ Or both lie there beside it. (fight) SIR ANDREW. That rings well! He bleeds, and freelyâthat has touched the quick! SIR HUGH. Look up a little longer, Geoffrey Builth! His well runs dry. DE BREOS. The sting that pricked him so, Has made him mad. O mercy! hold! yet hold! It is too late! forbear again! O cousin! (Geoffrey falls; his party attack Mahel.) Fie! this is butchery! let him go, Sir Hugh! What! ten to oneâand he past help! get from him! Enter Barnabas, followed by Saint Vallery, Sir Giles, Sir Humfrey, &amp;c. BARNABAS. Help! rescue! Newmark! Brecon! bastard! craven! Afraid to follow me, Sir Humphrey Uske? O shame, Saint Vallery! SIR HUMFREY. Hold, and hear me speak! A moment's truce, Sir Philip. DE BREOS. Aid me, thenâ I fight for peace with both sidesâstand apart! Can any tell us what the quarrel is? (Mahel is rescued.) O shame to soldiership! SIR HUGH. He has his hire. Now let him go, Sir Simon Hay. Art hurt? What! wounded too? DE BREOS. Take Geoffrey's casque away. See if he breathe. SIR ANDREW. The mischief is below. SIR HUGH. Why here are deaths enough for two or three! DE BREOS. Then heaven be gracious to him! Geoffrey's cry, Erewhile so loud, is changed from âBuilth and Brecon,â To âhelp and mercyââwhere we cannot hear it: Who claims the Earldom now from Hereford? Lie still, brave heart! for almost twenty years The strongest and the noblest strove to reach thee: Vile hands have found the way to thee at last: This grieves me more than all the rest! Who next? Builth falls to me, by heirshipâwhose is Brecon? I look no higher than Builth. What do we fight for? SIR ANDREW. Let Lord Fitzwalter plead against the king: Right rests with one of them. DE BREOS. Go some of youâ Our claims are narrower now by forty milesâ Instead of all the land twixt Tawe and Wye, A grave within the chantry of Saint Johnâ Tell Lord Fitzwalter so. With this he quits us. There is no more on either side. SIR GILES. Come allâ I will be surety for ample welcome. DE BREOS. There needs no pledge for such as he. Sir Hugh, Proclaim a truce, and call the archers off. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Castle Hall. Fitzwalter, Countess, Margaret, Bertha, Sir Paul, and Attendants. MARGARET. The bed were easier. FITZWALTER. I will tarry here: Bed-time is not come yet: by then, perchance, Our beds may change their tenants. BERTHA. Let me slack The mail-plates from about thy neck. FITZWALTER. Be gone! I pray the best I can against impatience. Such wounds will do no harm to aught besideâ Skin-scars and chaps which scarce yield blood enough For health hereafter: but with you to help, Their smarting vexes me. I will bide here. Sir Paul, a bachelor, is so far blessed, His wife has never seen him down and beaten. SIR PAUL. She might have seen me slip. FITZWALTER. Ay many a time; And beaten too, as mine has done to-day. Thou wouldst have laid the fault upon thy legs, The best of all thy servants. Geoffrey Builth Was more to blame than mine. Slips, verily!â Who rescued me? (enter Soldier) What news, Bartholomew? And whence? speak quick! SOLDIER. The river gate, my lordâ Sir Michael Brace is down. I come for aid: These cross-bow pellets rain so thick amongst us, We scarce may look between the battlements; And now du Chastel brings his ladders up. COUNTESS. Sir Michael Brace? SOLDIER. The while he turned to speak, A bolt sped betwixt the shoulders. FITZWALTER. Run, Sir Paul, Take every man ye meet with by the way. SIR PAUL. Best void the Barbican? FITZWALTER. Are all come in? Then hoist the bridge. (Enter soldiers, bearing the Seneschal.) SENESCHAL. Lay me down here awhile COUNTESS. His mail is rivettedâwhat, help! SENESCHAL. Drink! drink! No matter for the mailâcome nearer meâ I would not waste the little breath I have, Nor carry hence a lie as toll for hell. Mahel is Earl of BreconâWitness this! I saw the marriageâBaldwin keeps the pactsâ A year, or more, before his birth it was. Give me some wineâdrink! drink! COUNTESS. Already too much. Ye mark, his wits are gone. SENESCHAL. When I upheld Those shameful frauds they left me. Send for Ralphâ Search Baldwin for the vouchers. FITZWALTER. Hear him out. SENESCHAL. The Earl of BreconâMahelâwitness for me. (dies.) FITZWALTER. Heaven's peace and mercy be with thee! MARGARET. Alas! A fearful death! FITZWALTER. It matters little now, Except for truth's sake, whose the earldom is. If lies and fraud have lent it me a month, They were not mineânor shall I profit by them. Geoffrey of Builth is here to arbitrate. COUNTESS. I care notâbetter he the Earl than Mahel. Let might and valour take their sovereignty. The earldom was not founded by the base, Nor for the base. BERTHA. That dying man spake truth! COUNTESS. Ay, like a dying man he didâhe dared not The while he lived. I speak it when I please. Truth, mistress! Canst thou tell me what it is? The craven-hearted hind they called my son Was basely born by nature. Who regards The time he cameâwhether too soon or not? It must have been too soon, whene'er it was. He heard his mother's honor hooted atâ His own and sister's bastardy! He stood A patient witness in his father's hall The while Builth called me harlot! He an Earl Who did not dare to lift the gauntlet up? That milk-faced page, my son? A gospeller! If cowardice be base, he is a bastard!â Who shame their parents must be born too soon. Truth! Well then, truth is henceforth on my side: Even now thou canst discern scarce half of it. Didst hear that thirsty stammerer talk of pacts? Of marriage vouchers? Baldwin's testimony? They are, and have been, ready when I pleased. While Mahel's bones are bleaching on the hills, And Milo's head is hidden in Herefordâ I can maintain my honor here at Breconâ Ay, here and everywhere. (Enter Soldier.) FITZWALTER. What news dost bring? SOLDIER. Builth was upon his knee when I came in. FITZWALTER. His kneeâto whom? SOLDIER. The same that freed my lord, Has filled his place, since then, with better luck. FITZWALTER. Not man to man? SOLDIER. He seems the stouter one. FITZWALTER. Who is he? SOLDIER. He that cleared the gate of Builthâ So saved us once before to-day. He gives The same both grace and breathing time. Enter SIR GILES. Stand back! The Earl of Hereford is Earl of Breconâ He has no more competitors. The last Wants nothing this side heaven but room to lie in. Even that is begged for him. Sir Philip de Breos, Sir Humfrey Uske, Sir Reginald, Sir Hughâ The best on both sides, join their hands ungloved, And all are friends again. Here comes the conqueror Sore wounded, as it seems, and in a swoon:â But twice to-day he saved us all. Enter Barnabas and Soldiers, bearing Mahel, followed by Father Stephen. COUNTESS. He is Best soldier here on either side. Our knights Are rescued by our grooms! BARNABAS. Off with his helm! He shall not die so soon, whoe'er he is. The bowl there, lady. COUNTESS. Stand thou back, Sir Knave. BARNABAS. I stood in front of those who rescued him. SIR GILES. He did so, truly. Let him loose the casque. BARNABAS. Nay, let the Countess loose it. COUNTESS. So I will. 'Tis honor for the noblest here. Give roomâ Lift his head higher. BARNABAS. The water, Lady Bertha! Have water ready when his face is bare: Bring it, and hold it nearer to him, lady. (Bertha brings a vessel of water.) A ring upon his finger! What bodes this? Is he a knightâor how? (The helmet is removed.) BERTHA. Mahel! COUNTESS. My son! BARNABAS. Ay, lover, brother, son, but dead withal! Cry runaway and craven in his ear:â I did that loved him so. Wake, hollow-heart! Out with the bastard from his father's gate! Off, vagabond! He will not heed or hear me! STEPHEN. The fugitive has fled beyond disgrace! Loud tongues have spent their outcries! He came back To look upon the cruel once again, And die at home. BARNABAS. Thrust out the vagabond! THE END.</field>
