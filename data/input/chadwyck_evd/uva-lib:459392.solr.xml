      <field name="fulltext">To my loving and respected frriend Mr. Henry Burkhead Merchant, upon his Tragedie of COLA'S FVRY. I once did studie Navigation Thinking to draw my speculation, Vnto the Practique: when (alas) I found Safer (then set to Sea) to stay on ground. But thou (my friend) upon a faire pretence Reserved Art and prosperous Confidence Hast lanced forth into a raging tide, By thee not knowne (till now) nor ever tryed Yet got into the mayne, through Cruell Rocks Trough Read-Sea-Sands, and shelves, and boysterous shocks, Of murdering billowes, Cumbred with sad feares Of frighted and selfe-moaning Passengers, Do'st steere thy Course. Thy Card and Compasse show Thou do'st a plaine, smooth, and direct line know. Thou hast fresh gales and Sea-roome: for who shall Behold thy dolefull Pinnace rise and fall Mid'st such deepe dangers (as herein appeares) Weighing the misery shall with sighes and teares. Supplie the Ocean: with most glad desire Sit in thy steerage-roome: will there admire, Thy new-found skill: and with a dextrous ease Learne to sayle with thee, by like Windes and Seas. Thy assured Welwisher, William Smyth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his deere friend Mr. Henry Burkhead, upon his Tragedy of Cola's fury. Some have writ playes (my Burkhead) that have gain'd A large applause unto themselves, not strayn'd, Nor forc'd, nor hir'd but rightly; it is true They have deserved more, and more is due, Then can be payd them: some have well exprest A Politician, others one distrest: Some lusts and treasons, others Tyranny And others some the state and Majestie, Of Lords and Princes; others have well limb'd Th'extortious Souldier, others neatly trimm'd The Curious Courtier. But Sir, you portray'd Each various humour, variously array'd, And suted so each passion to the life Protheus we thought had been with you at strife who could produce most shapes, that we must say (Protheus hath labour'd with you 'bout this play. What? though of Terence, Seneca, we heare And other moderne Scenicks in our spherare, You I preferre. Iohnson for all his wit Could never paint out times as you have hit, The manners of our age: The fame declines Of ne're enough prays'd Shakespeare if thy lines, Come to be publisht: Beaumont and Fletcher's skill Submitts to yours, and your more learned quill. The most admired Sherly and the crew Of English Dramaticks cry hayle to you Phebus choice darling. Sir, I not admire The Muses nurst you, and he was your Sire: Paul Aylward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his deere friend the Author on his Tragedie of Cola's fury, or Lirenda's misery. When first I read your Tragedy and meete Truth, wit, and judgement trip with equall feet, VVithout th'expence of paines, that all may know They unconstrayned from your pen doe flow. I could not choose, but wonder that your braine VVithout great Arts could hit so high a straine, Such as the power of each line alone Is able to transforme a man to stone: Nor is it strange, when that therein wee see Such bloodie massachers and crueltie, As doth transcend what cruell Nero and Great Dyonisius acted in each land. Had Rubens and Vandike liv'd and at strife VVho should pourtray best, Cola to the life, Their curious Art, the way could never find To Paint his body, as thy Muse, his minde; Thou hast so liuely him exprest that I Reading was rapt into an extasie, But straight againe perplext with so great feare As if that cruell Cola present were, Deere friend since then this peece so well limn'd As most would thinke 'twas by Ben: Iohnson trimm'd, That Shakespeare, Fletcher, and all did combine To make Lirenda through the Clouds to shine, Enfranchise her, and let her come th'view Of publique Censure, where the best (be sure) VVill give her welcoms such as shall endure, Els as a Miser you'le be understood That hoords up gold, and does the poore no good, Feare not the Zoyly nor the Criticke faces That barke and snarle at th'Muses and the Graces, Their anticque mouthes and squinted eyes shall be, Stopt and obscur'd when they Lirenda see: Breake through the mists of Enuy and dispence Light, vigour, Motion and intelligence, To all that Candid art, whose votes shall Crowne The Worke and Author, with a smile, not frowne And to augment the Trophies of thy prayse Impale thy browes with wreathes of Delplique bayes. Daniell Breedr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGVE. Some Prologues wish their Audience ioyfull mirth, Some with Appelles strive to Painte the birth, Of their inventions; others not onely true, But pleasing to the kinde spectators view; Such would our Author to, had not his Muse, A mournfull subiect whom this age abuse; Nor can his Novice genius dive unto, The depth of what hee faine would tender you, Lirenda's Misery, who can forbeare, The ScÃ¦ne once past from a relenting teare, VVhen blustring stormes of murder, fire and sword Are the chiefe Emblems hee can best affoord, Your true compassive fancie, looke not then for, A Poets loftie dazeling Meteor, That to the vulgar eye might seeme more strange Then fertile Luna, in hir often change: Kinde Natives of this poore afflicted Ile, To your oppressions we addresse the style Of this our tragicke pen, who in effect, Are the supporters, of that Architect, Devised by him that never writ before, Yet honors you, your miseries adore, Your faithfull service, resolution and The most accomplisht vertues of this land, Sometime styl'd Insula Sanctorum, Now the true touchstone, or decorum, Of Heroicall mindes, whom envyes dire intent Endeavour'd to subvert with discontent: This Noble, Worthy, Auditors the scope Of what wee are resolv'd to shew, in hope, Your frequent goodnesse with attentive care. Our more imperfect lines will mildly beare, For which the Muses humbly we desire, Some heavenly rapture may your thoughts inspire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first Act. Enter a Constable and two Souldiers with halberts. 1. Sold. Mvst not a Creature passe? Const. No, that's the the scoape of our Commission: Stand; who comes there? Enter a Citizen. Cittiz. A friend. Const. The Word; Cittiz. Marry Sirs, God blesse us all; Const. well spoken, yet you must not passe, Citiz. Not passe? then if you be good fellowes, let us chat a while, prethee what meanes this sudden tumult? Const. The matter seemes so strange to me as yet, we can reurne no other answer, but the state on paine of death commands all men, (thus ready arm'd) to stand upon their guard; 1. Sould. You may be sure there's some rancke plot in hand, or would the State at these unusuall houres sit in a private Councell else: Citiz. 'Twish a fable; 'tis but some dronken quarrell thus disturbes our rest: or the field appointed by some hot furious gallant, whereto the State will not give way. Const. Be it the same, wee'll not remove from hence, nor you in dutie ought to sleight the matter thus, as if your worships wisedome were so ripe to apprehend the cause; Citiz. You cannot give more likelier reasons for't: Const. Y'are mistaken friend, the common report's abroad farre different from your conceit; rais'd to the highest point of a distracted mutiny, wee wote not what to thinke or speake, such is the horrid treacherie intended. Citiz. Good Lord forbid; 'gainst whom? Const. This City Castle; and by a few of Romish Recusants thinke to subvert the true reformed Gospell: Critiz. How? our owne fast friends, that were a jest indeed past my beliefe; Const. Be not incredulous: Citiz. How can I choose, but frame my thoughts like a confused Chaos; to thinke, these men who by exteriour signes and loving conversations, threw their hearts into our armes, nay more I might expresse: but that I see, all proves a fained friendship, and our joynt love's turn'd to a mortall hate; Const. 'Tis much, much feared, wee'll find it so e're long, written in Characters of blood. 1. Sold. Silence: the Lords themselves doe come, to give their best advice; Enter Pitho, Berosus, Mayor, Recorder. Pitho. Wee call'd you hether, to make knowne the danger, that now, even now is reveal'd, wherefore so true we conceive you be, that with all speed you goe unto each port, and see them strongly guarded, with strict command that none on paine of death shall issue forth, untill a true &amp; perfect search be made throughout this Citie, for as we credibly are inform'd, Guyrva with all his rude conspirators, are at this instant in a doubtfull feare to be discovered; the guilt of such a heynous fact doubtlesse betrayes them; Worthy friends, then slake not your endeavours; the hast which this great businesse now requires, admitts no leisure to stirre your willingnesse with th'effectuall speech of our just cause; that toucheth not your persons only; but aymes at the Crowne of our dread Soveraigne; and to imbase this Kingdomes glory, beneath the hollow concave of their Popish faction; this wee thought fit to adde unto your now intended care, not doubting yours, nor these your brethrens love to him, this waightie matter most concernes: Record. Sir, we really intend; (far from vaine glory be it spoken) to uphold this Cities ancient fame, that hitherto hath noblie borne, the tytle of a pure unspotted towne; when treason came as nie to cut you off, our fidelity did then expulse your foes and with the trophies of their bloodie spoyle return'd victorious, this we did, and are as willing yet to manifest the same so farre as heart and life can shew the dutie of allegiance: Bero. Them Noble acts renders you famous to posterity; nor did th'Angolean princes prove ungratfull for that service, as your faire City charter can approve, Reco. It is acknowledg'd their royall bounty, wherefore we that doe live will strive to give as great a lustre to th'Angolean nation, as our renowned ancestors have done, in this we rest, O Lord decree our willing powers may curb this treacherie. Exeunt omnes preter Pitho &amp; Bero. Pitho. Now kinde brother your grave experience must direct, what is most needfull to be done; Bero. The chiefest care whereto our watchfull eye should bar from future mischiefe, this strong fort by heavens protection is secured, therein disabling our insulting foes hence forward to proceed: Pitho. Then are our feares extinct? Bero. Not so, deere Sir, the tempest threatens our ruin still; for 'tis a maxime warlike leaders use, not to despise the weaknesse of their foes, which else might give advantage to their designe as many woefull presidents there are within the limitts of my youthfull dayes: (too tedious now to nominate,) for sixtie odde yeares past, since first I practis'd arms, in the Hiberean warres, when Tyrona ledd on by some vaine prophesie or other, did strive by dint of sword to assure himselfe the Northern Crowne, with much expence of blood at length t'h Angolean forces cool'd his pride, and made his haughtie courage stoope unto a base ignoble flight, yet now me thinks the terrour of this sudden hell-bred newes, strikes neere my heart, then all the legions of his furious traine, could at that instant when Black-water-Fort, prov'd fatall to the most and best of ours: Pitho. We then like prudent Statesmen must observe, some fit occasion may endeere the Palans to side with us, untill our powers encrease with new supplyes from the grand Parliament Bero. Your advice is good, but we are the valiant stout Osirus here, we then could best proceed; yet fearing least the pilfring Mountaniers doe fire the suburbs, 'twere not amisse, if we employed that warlike Leader brave Carola, Cola, with whom five hundred of our best and ablest men to front the foe at home; Now friend; from whence thy newes? Enter a Post with Letters. Post. From Adrohna; Pitho. How fares the Governor? Post. In health, an please your Lordship. Bero. Is the noble Lord Tigranes in safetie? They peruse the letters. Post. The same my Lord: Bero. It must not be difer'd a minute longer; goe hast thee to the governor againe, and tell him six hundred men compleatly arm'd shall forthwith march to strengthen him, and further bid him be of comfort, he shall not want, what's needfull; Post. I will not faile to returne your Lordships answer, Bero. Brother, we must withdraw to hasten what is promist we should incurre a lasting scandall else: Exeunt A march is beaten, then Enter Athenio, Mineus, Aretas Dora, Theodorike and Lentimos. Athenio.

Sir, you will be lost He reads. in this warre, by the hands of one you least suspect, before you shall returne againe: Must my labour, my zealous labour be, requited with a death I most abhorre, not that I feare grim death base conjurer, but that a Lirendean slave should vanquish me, and glorie in my overthrow, O, O, O, damn'd divells incarnate, if die I must my life shall cost ten thousand lives accurst Enter Tibernus. Tiber. There's at least a score of arch-traitors sent to towne, whereof one Cephalon. Cola. Ha, Brukill I hope, Tibe. The very same; Cola. God's blessing on thy heart, for this good newes; a very rogue in graine. Tibe. There is another old Commander, whom they call Lieutenant-Collonell Rufus, one can disclose more then a hundred more, Cola. I'le serue it out of his old bones i'faith: good Tibernus fetch them hither. Tibe. Them all? Cola. No, none but that paire of cunning rogues: desire the Constable to yoake the rest, they cannot be secure, Exit Tibe. enough, but these shall to the racke without redemption. Enter Tibernus, Cephalon, Ruffus and Souldiers. Tiber. Cleere the way there, for the prisoners, ho, Cola. Are you there Sirs? have you brought Magna Charta, to reprive you from the gollowes? ha Ceph. No, His Majesty's more gracious. Cola. What, what, to pardon a rable of disloyall Cut-throates, a nimble actor of this bold Commotion? Ceph. I never was. Cola. I say thou lyest traytor. and sate in chiefe commission. Ceph. Never in my life. Cola. Better confesse. Ceph. What I did not? Cola. The racke shall force thee then. Ceph. Mercy great Sir supports his royall throne from whence your glories are derived, and is th'admired Emblem of heroicall vertue disperst throughout the world, wherein his highnesse like a prince composed of goodnes, would not his subjects ruin, but rather have his mercy eminent, as himselfe is good Cola. Rugh curres, now y'are glad to fawne, when hetherto 'twas lofty bragges yee stood on, a treacherie I'le trample into dust, and make you know, before we part, what homage you doe owe: Ruf. Sir, for my selfe thus much I will confesse, not that I feare thy racke or tortures Cola, for why they shall no more then what I freely speake, I was indeed employed by the state of Lirenda, poore discontented Lirenda; to make knowne their woefull grievance to his Sacred Majestie, which had he knowne, doubtlesse his royall soule would grieve to heare th'unheard of crueltie; thy squadrons exercise: Cola. I tell thee doting traytor they are justly serv'd. Ruf. How, traytor? Cola. I traytor to thy face I speake it. Ruf. Even to thy selfe I doe returne the same. Cola. How captious they thwart me with insulting language; leade them to execution straight. Tibe. First use the racke. Cola. He dyes. Tibe. Let me beseech you Sir. Cola. At thy request it shall be so. Tibe. The racke sirs, ho: The Souldirs fetch in the racke. Ruf. Before that engine of inveterate malice comes, vouchsafe me hearing; I claime a double priviledge; first the benefit of your late printed Proclamation Osirus promise next I should have quarter, such as became a martiall man to have, which now we humbly offer your acceptance. Cola. Dissembling Crocodile, thy hidden spleene shall not corrupt justice by invective flattery, no vipers no, a world of tortures are more requisite. Ceph. Let Mercy mittigate your rage. Cola. Presume to speake againe, and by my soveraignes hand you both shall hang. Ruf. That were an act like thy selfe. Tibe. Come sirs you must unloose with expedition Ceph. Is that the recompence of our submission, will neither honour, faith, nor pittie move thee. Cola. He stirres my choller, will none obey my will I'le teare each limme my selfe asunder, unlesse with speed he suffer? Tibe. Doe not provoke him Sir. Cephalon is layd on the racke and drawne. Ceph. Heaven grant us patience then. Cola. A standish Sirs: take now th'examination as he speakes it; Ceph. Hold, hold, for Christs sake hold; the torment's great. Cola. Did'st not thou conspire to surprize the Castle? Ceph. Yes, yes, I did. Cola. And went to severall parts of the kingdome for powder? Ceph. I did, I did. Cola. Wast not thou private to their consultations? Ceph. Very true. Cola. Did not you then intend, to extirpate all th'Angolean Protestants, to disposesse our Soveraigne of his Crowne, to usurpe the government of Lirenda? Ceph. My conscience cannot accuse them so, Cola. 'Tis false thou sayest: Ceph. O no, no, no: Cola. Rack up the villen higher yet, till he confesse, confesse I bid thee. Ceph. Torments force me, to acknowledge that was never done. Cola. How, how? Ceph. I doe confesse what you demand is true. Cola. Write that Tibernus, when thy rebellious kinsmen and thy selfe, would carouse and feast, you wish'd my head among you there, Ceph. We did, Cola. For which thou shalt a twist up higher yet. Ceph. Then as you hope for mercy Sir forbeare, my paines intollerable; oh I die. Cola. Now take him off, your turne comes next. Ruf. In vaine you seeke to force me Sir, since what I speake shall be through feare not truth: nor will refuse to answer the least syllable you aske. Cola. Expect no favour 'tis denyed thee: Ruf. Such favour mayst thou at thy last judgment finde: Rufus is laid on the Racke &amp; drawn, O cruell tyrant, will no remorse of conscience enter thy blacke soule to see, my aged limbes thus rent with tyrannie? Tibe. Better confesse, then languish on the racke, Ruf. I can no more then what unto the Councell else I did. Cola. Higher with him: confesse in hast, or by great Iove i'le racke thy life away, Ruf. Take it, O take my wretched life away, so it appease thy furie, no toungue can tell what torments I endure? Tib. He faintes an please you. Cola. Let him faint and hang to, no great matter, a doting proud obdurate foole, will not confesse, goe take them hence unto the jayle; 4. Sould. Your pleasure shall be done. 2. Sould. Zlid, search their pockets. 3. Sould. 'twill make us swill boyes, swill boyes merily 2. Sould. Thanke me for that, good man dunse, or it should walke to the Constable againe. 1. Soul. His shallow Coxcomb, had not the wit to thinke on't. 3. Sould. However anon wee'll be as joviall lads, as cup and can. Exeunt. Cola. The rests shall be used with like severitie. Tib. 'Twere wisely done of you. Enter Souldiers leading in two Countreymen. Cola. Who have you there? 1. Sould. Two rogues with each a bag of salt we tooke, going to supply their wants abroad, Cola. You have done well, to intercept the knaves: goe bid the Provost Marshall execute them presently: 1. Sould. Come away, come an' be hang'd. Man. Where master? 1. Soul. To be hang'd that's plaine English, Man. I trow no, for what Agra? 1. Sould. The gallowes will instruct you better, come an' be hang'd, come. Exeunt. Enter Belfrida. Tibe. Behold your chiefe spie is return'd Sir Carola. your Argos, your pretty tell tale Mercury, Belf.

Cola. Hell take them first, a brood of most disloyall vipers, ha, what peremptorie slave durst tell this fable? Belfr. Them who invoke your happy fates, for certaine did approve it upon oath, and further said, one Dictus went for that expected ayd: Cola. What is he gone to Sea? Belfr. Yes gone to Sea. Cola. A blister build on thy tongue foule serpent Tibernus thou lovest me, Tibe. My heart and life is yours. Cola. Speed after good Tibernus in all post, send forth a power to watch at every coast, perhaps he lurkes in hollow caves abroad, till winde and tide doth serve, whil'st this base rascall, (corrupted with a golden bribe,) will not reveale his private haunt. Belfr. Sir, if I have offended pardon me: Cola. By heavens I will not, put him into the Provost Marshalls custodie, till further order comes from us; Tibernus charge Amphilus on his life to scoure the Seas, and let the harvest be destroyed. Exeunt. Tibe. It shall. Cola. What Hercules can remove this mountaine of enraged passions from my heart? O now it nothing fitts my care to speake but thunder or take into my throate the trumpe of Heaven, with whose determinate blasts the winde shall burst, that blew his sailes aloft, and th'enraged Seas consume their foamy waves, that will not let his vessell sinke, whereby my care might be disperst, void of suspicion, ascending from, this wicked plot unseene, a poysoned plot sufficient to infect the world; when they doe shew themselves the worst of men: Exit. Enter Elleonora, pursued by a Souldier his sword drawne. Sould. Stay harlot stay, or by the heavens above, I'le neither spare thee for reward nor love: Elleo. Pittie oh pittie friend my woefull case, my parents are by thee already slaine, what would my loathsome life availe thee then, kinde heart relent, relent if any sparke of civill grace be in thee.

Enter Theodoricke. Theod. Me thinkes I hard not very farre from hence some woefull Creatures to lament and greeve, crying a loud for helpe, as 'twere, Elleo. Helpe, helpe; Theod. Some ravisht virgin did emplore my aide, I'le therefore search this silent desert thorow untill I find from whence proceeds, this heavy dolefull crye: Elleo. 'Tis shame to use a maiden thus. 1.

Oh stay thy murdering hand: murder, murder: 2. Soul. A shee divell by God: canst not kill her troe: He spies them. Theod. Direct me heaven, O that in time I may bestow my helpe: ha, what base inhuman fray is this? I did suppose as much, when first, her shrill laments did pierce the aire, and sent into my soule a deepe conceit of pittie, ha, two to one weake creature drench in teares, trust me, the oddes is much, and marvaile shee held out so long; well name of God, i'le forward, fly shamelesse villens fly, if not, by heavens I'le force your flight, &amp; thus revenge her wrong: He strikes at them 1. Sould. Rascall thou shalt deerely repent that blow. Theod. Release that Ladie first, I claime her mine, if not, be sure this blade's as sharpe as thine. He drawes. 1. Sould. We meane not Sir at your request to flinch as if we feared thy lofty threats, no, no proud loytring scab, get thee away in time, or thou shalt rue the houre, and curse the day, in seeking to deprive us of our pray. Theod. Vntie her speedily base pilfring rogues, or by them powers above, youle soone repent, the wrong you doe this harmelesse innocent: Elleo. Rescue, O rescue Noble Sir, a virgin, ready to be deprived of such a treasure, once lost, the world cannot repaire againe. Theod.

Quarter, quarter, good Sir give me quarter, Theod. The very same that all thy bloody tribe doth give my Countreymen, when they submit their fainting lives upon a faithlesse promise: goe, meet thy brothers soule poore naked rogue, where greedie Charon waites to waft him ore, unto great Belzibubs infernall shore; Now be at libertie: give thanks to God therefore.

Deare heart relate the legend of thy misfortune. Elleo. Sir, my griefes would rent a heart of marble, were it sensible of them grosse abuses done (perhaps) unto your owne deere friends as well as mine: oh Cola, that mounster tyrant Cola, his barbarous command, no civill thought but thought but must lament to thinke ont, a Turke could not more brutish villaine then he, and to a kingdome (good God,) that raised both him and his from nothing, my aged Father, Mother, Brother, Sisters all, all my deere friends were basely murdered by him, when having notice of ther bloodie ends, feare lead me hither, supposing I was free from danger, but oh it almost proved a theater of rape and murder, had not your valour ransom'd my hard fate; To these I did a shoure of liquid teares present in lieu of what they sought, but would not doe: when my chiefe comfort was the gods, oh they, would then transforme me like to Niobes, my griefes Ide most happy had I beene, then Metamorphos'd like that mournfull queene; Weepes.

Then you reward my small endeavours highly: come my faire prisoner, wherein more freedome we may dispence with fullen, griefe a while, prethee letts to the next adjacent garison and as (without selfe spraise) I late did shield thee from the furie of these slaves, so under God I'le be thy safeguard thither, whence may proceed, some kinde refreshment to poore soules in need.

Them gentlemen that now are in restraint for the same fact speakes thy accomplisht willingnesse, Barb. O no. doe not cast that foule aspersion on them, so farre I doe presume their worth is such, that death cannot urge them expresse as much, Tigr. This falshood shall in thy blood appeare, Barb. Noble Sir: my fault as you have censured it, never deserv'd the least of this God knowes: if innocence may pleade my cause, no soule more wrong'd then I; weepe. Tigr. Them teares resemble Synons trecherie against old Priams Troy, wherefore 'tis said, vice doth her just hate never more provoke, then when she vailes it under vertues cloake: discover Brinsforts plot immediatly or as I live I'le spare no tortures on thee: Bar. Enjoyne my sinne some other penance, if truth must not appeare t'acquit me from so foule a scandall, hide, O hide, my loath'd face, in some nastie gloomy dungeon; or hang in chaines untill I eate the flesh, that ne're offended, here then my naked brest, readie to receive what you will scribe thereon; my blood will ferve instead of inke, where if you please record, how willingly I suffer'd for my Lord and maker Christ. Tigr. For lustfull treason rather, untill thou dost confesse, il'e write in wounds fit characters to thy rightfull sufferance. Here shee is drawne aloft, with burning matches between each finger. Barb. O kill me, kill me, doe but grant that favour, be no more crueller then death, feele, O feele, your heart's transform'd to stone, let my heart's blood dissolve your selfe againe, else you'le become the lively portraicture of tirannie; Tigr. Thus I expresse me yet, Barb. And yet I live: Tigr. All the torments hell can boast of shall be inflicted on thee; not suddenly no, but with a fretting paine vex thy desire, Barb. Thy cruell thoughts to hell's darke plagues aspire, Iesu Redeemer of my soule, to thee I must addresse my pittifull complaint, when men rakes lesse remorse on contrite teares then Tigers doe, thou knowest, O Lord; whither my thoughts were ever guiltie of that crime deserving this unheard of crueltie, but, O eternall wisedome my griefe cryes at thy watchfull eare for every, vouchsafe it may, abate them torments that will last for aye. 1. Sould. How resolute these pettish Papists are, Aside. she'd sooner let her fingers burne to th'bone, then once reveale, a rebells base intention, 2. Sould.

O be not thus incredulous, Iewes, Turkes, Infidells, yes Heathens to, all nations doe commiserate the dolefull paines of them like me, nor will not urge them further, once the fires exposed, but your beliefes more strange then theirs. Tigr. Confesse, thou foolish wench confesse, or I will cause new match to be applyed: Bar. Doe what you please, my God I trust will strengthen me against thy hellish furie. Tigr. 'Tis a folly. to compell this slut I see, goe, take her off. untill some evidence comes in against her. Exeunt.</field>

Sou. Good father doe, our joyes in your contentment. Abne. Fond youthes your yet unripned yeares, brookes not the lowring jesture of deserved sorrowes, (how neere soever it concernes you,) why your spring o'retops the Autumne of my yeares, your griefes a weather-cocke, subject to change at every blast of youthfull pleasure; but when dame nature dyes your flaxen curles a reverend gray, experience will confute that fond deluding follie: this is no common toy (like yours) to grive at, no, no, peruse them mournefull lines, where if you find not cause of lamentation, blame me then: He gives the letter they peruse it 1. Son. Ha, Lirenda at point to be destroyed! O brother see, that countrey whence we are discended, calls for some timely succour: nature must worke a true compassion in us: Father, O Father, by all that is most Deere unto you, regard this sad complaint: gives it back. Abn. Now be yourselves the judge whether we ought not pitty them, or preferre their safetie sooner then all the fortunes mightie Spaine will give us, value the difference pray: here we be indeed accommodated with respect and honour, wealth sufficient for our betters, with the grace of Spaine's Emperiall Monarch, what doe we lacke? nothing, but yet compared to the affection of our Countrey, not worth the speaking. 1. Sou. Weed' rather forfeit what we have, then stay a minute once our friends doe crave: Abn. That's each of your firme resolution. Ambo. We humbly yeeld to your mature direction, Abn.

Dora. We could rehearse as many more sufficient to amaze the most obdurates Round-head of them all, but to expresse; that we regard Tygranes forces lesse, then may be spoken of, whilest we can wield these armes, such cutting weapons that can soone decide, the best of eithers right Enter Lentimos. Mine. Behold Lentimos with some sad newes it's fear'd Athe. It shall not worke in us the worst may follow, Now Cuze, how goes squares abroade. Lent. That Lord Tigranes with his army doth commit all kinde of cruelties, and march directly hither: Athe. What strength can you discover him to be? Lent. About five thousand, horse and foote, Athe. Were he ten thousand strong it matters not wee'll expect him at Lesterne passage, goe take a hundred musqueteers along with you, and make it good before his van arrives: wee'll follow after in all convenient Exit Lentimos. speed: Wee are not ignorant, noble kinsmen, how insolent, bold, and audacious these forlorne wretches doe contest with us, for what's our birth-right and inheritance, that in defence of that, or what is deerest to us, wee are to expose our selves to death, the wrong done our poore harmeles people, all the most studied torments was inflicted on them, for which wee chiefely move, attired in armes to rouze their stupid conscience that will strictly answer for't; whil'st now each goodnes doth forsake them; it cannot passe so currant but wee may give an end to their vaine hopes, heaven yeelding us that priviledge, though not worthy yet wee need not doubt it; Then let us arme, as well interiour, as exteriourly, to be in a fit posture 'gainst he comes let trumpets sound, strike up our Martiall drums: Drum and Trumpets as they depart. Enter Tigranes and Tibernus. Tigr. Where lyes their Campe? Tib. A Lestern passage some some three miles distant hence, Tigr. Are they strongly fortified. Tiber. Impregnable, and hardly can be forc'd, without great losse of ours, Tigr. Have they artillery thinke you, Tib. Yes some small piece they have, Tigr. Which shall be mine, or mine theirs ere bright Titans rayes decline, goe, bid the officers be readie, for intend to march against them presently Exit Tibernus. a Curse on his life for me, that will not breake on them, or use the most extremitie he can devise, a storme of tortures, untill the mountaine of their vicious will are brought to nothing; O that it lay within my power to cut off roote and branch together, if not, be sure, I'le doe my best endeavour. Exit. Soone after the Alarums begun hee returnes with his weapon drawne. Tigr. All will not doe, some horrible wicked destinie befriends them, our men drop downe on every side, whereat they seeme to scoffe, and floute, not giving ground an inch, well, well, Tigranes shall not be affronted thus I'le sooner die, and fight it out to the last man, death shall not hold me. Enter Tibernus. Tiber. Remove your standing Sir, I doe beseech you Sir withdraw your person to some other place: for hence I can descrie a piece right levell'd to give fire at you; Tigr. That man is curst in his mothers wombe, will shun a Canon shot A shot is given forth. ah, I am wounded, wounded, beyond recovery, Now, O now I feele the painefull seizures of untimely death, on the remainder of my vitall breath, vaine world adieu, farewell brave Souldiers all be not dismaid, at Lord Tigrane's fall; Tibe. Heaven's blessed messenger, receive thy soule. Souldiers steps in. Sould. But is he dead indeed? Tibe. As cold as stone; 1. Sould. Wee that have loved him when he lived, &amp; found his open heart, a Magazine of bountie, must (if nature be not too ungratefull,) shed brinish teares, Tiber. That were effeminate, and indiscretion too, Now hee's lost, if in the view of our adversaries we seeme to grieve, it may occasion greater evills, having th'advantage of our generall losse; then silence best becomes you, for the present all that is requisite must be to beare his bodie hence unto his tent; so sadly on, that when true sorrow's in the hearts of all his Corps may have a noble funerall: Exeunt. Beat a march, Enter Abner, Athenio, Mineus, Aretas, Dora, and Lentimos. Athe. Thus through the helpe, and furtherance of heaven our most malignant enemy's overcome glad to play least in sight, went sneking home, who not long since, for oathes, and threatnings might terrifie the gods, or subdue the world, that neither Heaven nor Hell was thought on once, or what was spoken of them were but fictions which lead them to the gulfe of desperation. Abn. We must pursue this blessed victorie, making our withered hopes, bud forth in blossomes of never fading honour: Dora. It adds unto our comfort Noble friends, that Caspilona goes on bravely to, Abn. Yes, and God willing we intend so to, untill we purge the Kingdome of these drones, them viperous Locusts; Come follow me, Lent. But stay my Lord, here comes a Post with letters to your Lordship; Enter a Post with letters. Abn. How letters? let me see; had they defer'd it but one fortnight longer, Athe. What newes doe them import? Abn. A proclamation, for one whole twelve moneth and a day's Cessation, Lent. This works in us a greater admiration that being in the full height of our conquest as prosperous as might be expected brave Abner's shining vertues like the Sun out of a new Horizon, all the graces delighfull Mars could give, or we deserve, must through this needles fond cessation, rest on the drowsie Couch of darke Oblivion; it is a pill few Souldiers can digest; Athe. Which best approves our loyaltie, Abn. But you. and we must yeeld obedience to it, though not so well contented; howsoever your forces must unto their garisons, And if our wrongs be not repaired thereby we will againe, renew this Tragedie. Exeunt. Solemne Musick's heard: whil'st an Angell appeares to perclose the ScÃ¦ne, with this following Song. Peace to this bright resplendant spheare Blessings numberles be there, Endles ioyes that doth abide, In Elizeum too, beside Nothing present may defile This victorious sacred Ile. Come yee Gods and Goddesses, That affecteth Peacefull blisse, Helpe Victoria to disperse, Each blessing on this Vniverse, That dissentious broyles and iarres, May end with these uncivill Warres. Haste, O haste delightfull Queene, VVith your Lawrells fresh and greene, Grace this nation with a Crowne, Of perpetuall renowne, Since their Warlike merits are, Past the limitts of Compare.
