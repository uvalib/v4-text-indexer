      <field name="fulltext">PART I. SCENE I. Rosalie's Bower, with a distant View of her Castle and Domains; she is discovered seated in her Bower, attended by Knights, Fair Dames, Minstrels, Dancers, &amp;c. AIRâMINSTREL. Bold knights and fair dames to my harp give an ear, 'Till news from our absent Count Albert appear, And you haply may sigh in the midst of your glee, At the parting of Albert and fair Rosalie. Oh! see you yon Castle so strong and so high? And see you yon Lady, the tear in her eye?â But with shell in his hat, and with staff in his hand, See! a Palmer approaches from Palestine's land! Enter Osric (the Lion) disguised as a Palmer, he approaches and bows to Rosalie. DUETâMINSTREL, AND OSRIC, DISGUISED. Min. Now Palmer, grey Palmer, oh tell kind and free, What news bring you home from the holy country; And how goes the warfare by Galilee's strand, And how fare our Nobles, the flow'r of the land? Pal. O, well goes the warfare by Galilee's wave, For Gilead and Nablous, and Ramah we have! And well fare our Nobles by mount Libanon, For the Heathens have lost, and the Christians have won. ROSALIE AND MINSTREL. And Palmer, good Palmer, by Galilee's wave, Oh! saw ye Count Albert, the gentle and brave? When the Crescent went back, and the Red-cross rush'd on, Oh! saw ye him foremost on mount Libanon? Pal. Oh! lady, fair lady, as green the tree grows, Your hopes soar on high, while the stream clear it flows; But the pure stream runs muddy, your gay hope is gone, Count Albert is taken on mount Libanon! (Throws off his disguise, and appears in a very splendid martial garb.) But Osric, the lion, thy bold kinsman see! Whose heart's wounded deadly, its balm lives with thee; Who brings thee rich presents in foreign climes grown, Who proffers his hand, and wou'd call thee his own, Since Albert is Captive on mount Libanon. Dancers, &amp;c. attendants on Osric, trip forward with presents, and sing the following CHORUS. Nimbly trip we blythe and bland, While the tale of love is told, And Rosalie bestows her hand On the lion-knight so bold! Osric throws himself at the feet of Rosalie, who treats his love with disdain, calling round her her Minstrels, &amp;c. they join in the following RESOLVEâMINSTRELS AND LADIES. Mark Rosalie's resolve!â To the Sorceress whose magic can wonders dilate, She hies to past doubt, learn her brave Lover's fate; For be Albert living, or be Albert dead, No other will Rosalie take in his stead. Exeunt. Osric, thunderstruck at her resolution, seems undetermined how to act, but closes a hasty minute of meditation, by resolving at all hazards to obtain her; starts, confusedly, on being met by Urilda and Carloman, who are lead on by Nero, his sable Domestic. AIRâURILDA. False, false-hearted Osric, behold by thy side, Urilda, thy vows have agnised as thy Bride, Base artifice did her delude: To anguish a prey, lost, dishonour'd her fame, Thy infant unbless'd with a Father's fond name, At the altar shou'd Osric fair Rosalie claim, This dagger would drink her heart's blood! Osric endeavours, hypocritically, to sooth, while, aside, he issues his unfeeling commands to Nero to dispatch her. OSRIC, URILDA, AND CARLOMAN. Osric. For awhile I must leave thee, Urilda, why sigh? How I love thee these kisses must tell, (Aside to Nero.) When the midnight bell tolls, let it be their death bell, The brat and his mother must die. Farewell! my sweet babe, dear Urilda farewell! Uril. Farewell, gallant Osric, Carlo. Dear Father, farewell! They embrace him, and exeunt on opposite sides. SCENE II. âMagic Cavern. The Sorceress is discovered in the centre, her wand elevated, and her eyes fixedâRosalie, timidly, approaches and prostrates herself. AIRâSORCERESS. Daughter, wou'dst thou by witchcraft's charm, Inquiry's aid pursue? Three drops of blood draw from thine arm, And pluck the baneful yew! (The Sorceress presents her a dagger, with which she draws three drops of blood, and plucks a slip of yew âthe Sorceress forms a circle of flame.) Approach, my child, and where I place The magic circle stand, And fear not aught of ghastly face, That glides beneath my wand. (Rosalie, tremblingly, occupies the circle.) And now, my child, my power to aid, Count Albert's father's grave To me shall render up the dead, And send him to my cave. His skeleton obeys my spell, And to the figur'd walls His hand of bone shall point and tell What fate his Son befalls. Waves her wand over a centre Ruin, from which a skeleton, bearing a Death's dart in his right hand, gradually rises, and inscribes on a part of the Rock, âAlbert is Captive in Palestine;â Rosalie, convinced of her Lover's fate, begs the assistance of the Sorceress in forwarding his release, who embraces her, and, waving her wand, the Scene changes to SCENE III. An extensive Lake, supposed to lead to the Ocean, backed by a glowing Horizon, its borders on each side fancifully decorated with Weeping Willows, &amp;c. at the same time the form and habit of the Sorceress changing to that of a beautiful Ãrial Spirit. A splendid barge, with canopied seats, appropriate rowers, &amp;c. at the beach ready to receive herâa brilliant suit of armour and arms under the canopyâ Rosalie's attendants, some bearing caskets of Jewels, and others store of Gold, enter. AIRâSPIRIT. Fly hence, Rosalie, to Count Albert with speed, Yon armour and sword shall be sure at thy need: I attend theeâtake shipping for Palestine land, And ransom Count Albert from Soldanrie's hand. They ascend the barge with attendants, bearing gold, &amp;c. Rosalie affectionately taking leave of the remainder. CHORUS OF ATTENDANTS. Farewell, lady dearâspeed to Palestine's land, And ransom Count Albert from Soldanrie's hand. The Barge is rowed off, and her attendants exeunt. Osric, followed by Mauleon, hastily rushes on, and, indignant at Rosalie's escape, dispatches him to hasten his galley, which is instantly rowed on, Bargemen singing. CHORUS. Yeo, yeo, yeo, bestir the splashing oar! Bear bold Osric to the distant shore, Fair Rosalie the object we pursue. (He and Mauleon proceed on board, Urilda and Carloman enter, followed by Nero.) Urilda. Where, where's my Osric? Carlo. Where my father dear? Osric. Angel of death! my bane, alas! is near!â(aside (Urilda and Carloman are lead on board by Nero.) Adieu! my love adieu! Urilda. Oh, hurry not, Osric, a wretch to her grave! Whose fault is so venial, a fault if it be; For who cou'd have ears, and not hear thou art brave? Or who have a heart, and not give it to thee? Chorus. Yeo, yeo, yeo, bestir the splashing oar! Osric. (to Nero.) Weak-hearted wretch!âwhy draw the beings breath? 'Ere three boats length our Galley rows from shore: (to Urilda) Farewell, my loveâ(to Nero) thy dagger dooms their death! (As they row off, Nero, with uplifted dagger, is on the point of dispatching Urilda, Carloman supplicates) Carlo. Spare, spare my mother!â Urilda. Do not drive me wild!â Osric. They both must die. Urilda. Spare, spareâoh, spare my child! (Nero pities and spares themâthey cling in tender solicitude to Osric, who, irritated, dashes them over the galley's side into the Lake, and orders the Bargemen to ply their oars.) Osric. Rapid as the wind o'er ocean's bosom row, To the bottom, to the bottom, unpitied down they go, While merrily the mariner sings yeo, yeo, yeo. They sustain themselves by branches of the Weeping Willow, till Nero darts to their assistance, and saves their livesâthen, heart broken, leads them off. SCENE IV. âKing Baldwin's Tent, Centinels, &amp;c. discoveredâBaldwin and Officers come forward. Enter Ãrial Spirit, introducing Rosalie and attendants, whom King Baldwin welcomes to his Camp âwhile learning their errand, a trumpet is sounded, and Killarney, Count Albert's 'Squire, is brought on wounded, salutes his Monarch, and thus addresses him: RECITATIVEâKILLARNEY. Oh! St. Patrick defend us, my own master's ta'en, Myself too lay kilt all alive with the slain; 'Till the knights of the Sepulchre rais'd me from death, And breathless I'll thank them as long as I've breath! (Bowing to his Companions.) SONGâKILLARNEY. 1. My heart is as sound as the heart of shi-la-lah, Old Honesty keeps it as warm as a toast, With kisses and blows, och! its glowing so gayly, And sure fair Fidelity isn't my boast. When the Piper strikes up, why I jig it away, Look loving, dear joy, when I've nothing to say, And when battle rages, I battle away. With my foo rol lol lol, ral tal la ral loo! And a Whack for the honour of Ireland. 2. Since my head was so small as an apple potatoe, I followed the sound of the drum and the fife; And Love, Wine and War, with the joys of good nature, Smooth'd sweetly the wrinkles and furrows of life. When the Piper, &amp;c. 3. A friend never ax't, when distress play'd the divil. A lift from myself but I halv'd him my all; And in fight, och! the conquer'd found Larry so civil, He lifted them up when he tipp'd them a fall. When the Piper, &amp;c. Exit. Baldwin and suite retire, Rosalie urges the Ãrial Spirit to prepare for their undertaking, bending to Heaven in supplication to crown them with success. Osric enters, throws himself at Rosalie's feet, and kisses her handâshe shudders, extricates herself, and flies himâenraged, he seizes herâshe screamsâ the Ãrial Spirit, King Baldwin, &amp;c. enter. RECITATIVEâSPIRIT. Base Wretch, desist!âthy life to come improve, And henceforth cherish this thy injured Love! Waves her wand three times, and Urilda with Carloman, followed by Nero, enterâSpirit informs Baldwin of Osric's cruelty, who commands him to make instant expiationâbecome desperate, he attempts to stab Urilda, but is prevented by Nero, and seized by Killarney and SoldiersâBaldwin, &amp;c. with disgust, retiring. RECITATIVEâKILLARNEY. Fie, fie! och! why would you your Knighthood thus neglect? Heav'n's loveliest work! sweet woman! 'tis our duty to protect. Osric breaks from their hold, and Mauleon, rushing on with Soldiers to his assistance, drives off Killarney and his Troops. AIRâOSRIC. For the love of fair Rosalie I left my native land; For the love of fair Rosalie, I lead this gallant band; But scorn'd by fair Rosalie, my love is turn'd to hate, Death be her portion, though Hell be my fate! Exeunt. SCENE V. âSplendid Eastern Pavillion. Consisting of three triumphal arches, through which enter in grand procession the Soldan, Zulema, Zaphra, Safadina, Circassians, Mourad, Mufti, Saracen Band, Officers, Soldiers, Captives, Count Albert in chains, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. CHORUS OF SARACENS. Let war cymbals clatter, Bold trumpets loud reply, O'er the Red-Cross the Crescent Has gain'd, has gain'd the victory! And he, whose bright Falchion Spread death o'er the plain, The flow'r of their nobles, Count Albert is ta'en. Then let, &amp;c. The procession over, all the characters arrange themselves, Zulema gazing with love-lorn looks on Albert, who, absorbed in sorrow for his fate, casts his eyes despondent on the earthâat the desire of Zulema, Zaphra, &amp;c. approach, and thus address him. TRIOâZAPHRA AND ATTENDANTS. Captive knight why entranc'd thus? arouse thee ho! Let not care be thy senses beguiling; Though sorrow sits brooding upon thy knit-brow, A fair maid approaches thee smiling. (Zulema, with smiles, approaches him.) Employ like a Lover those love-kindling eyes, 'Tis Love makes life's journey pass sweetly! Smooth thy brow gallant stranger, to Love breath those sighs! And the dance shall go gaily and featly. Zulema leads a short measure, with which Albert appears delighted; at the close she curtsies; he seeming to solicit a continuation, she dances a Pas Seul, at the end of which, enraptured, he throws himself at her feet; she takes off his chains, and presents him to the Soldan. The Soldan comes forward, and offers him his Daughter if he will quit the Christian cause, and bear arms in his defenceâfascinated with her charms, he consentsâshe still appears coyâZaphra approaches, and addresses him. AIRâZAPHRA. Oh, Christian! brave Christian! her Love would'st thou be, Three things must thou do 'ere she hearken to thee; Our Garb, and our Worship, on thee shalt thou take, And this thou must first do for Zulema's sake. A rich Persian Caftan and splendid Turban are presented him by the Mufti, which they have scarce adorned him in, when a trumpet sounding, Rosalie and the Ãrial Spirit, in Pilgrim's habits, followed by attendants bearing gold and jewels, one preceding the rest with a banner, on which is inscribed, âRansom offered for Count Albert,â proceed hastily up the stageâa pauseâAlbert appears to tremble, and waver in his resolvesâRosalie astonished, timidly approaches him, and discovers herself âhe starts abashed, sinks affectionately at her feet, and intreats her pityâshe raises himâthey embraceâthe Soldan separates them, and the Mufti seizing his hand, links it in that of Zulema, who fondly presses it to her lipsâRosalie, heart-broken, supplicates attention, offers ransom, &amp;c.âthe Soldan, enraged, commands her to depart (triumphantly leading off the Count,) refusing her offers in the following GRAND CHORUS. Tho' unnumber'd her riches as sands of the Sea, No wealth can give Albert to fair Rosalie: For he has ta'en the green Caftan, the Turban put on, For love of the Maiden of Mount Libanon. Rosalie, faints into the arms of the Ãrial Spirit, who, waving her wand, a Page enters, bearing a brilliant sword and shield, and Rosalie recovering, she throws of her Pilgrim's habit, and appears in superb silver armour. AIRâSPIRIT. Dry thine eyes, luckless damsel, transform Love to Hate, His Cruelty merits but scorn: A maiden so true, sure deserv'd better fate, Affection so pure a return. Inconstancy, like death's cold dart, Transfixes daggers in the faithful heart; But gird thee on this well tried sword, 'Gainst Infidels the War to wage: The God of Love will be thy guard, And shield thee in the battle's rage. But if in dire combat you Albert should meet, And meeting, his sabre a death's-wound should prove, Compunction as sinking in gore at his feet, Would to madness awaken his Love. The sight would strike, like death's cold dart, Unnumber'd daggers in his faithless heart! But gird thee on, &amp;c. Rosalie armed, gallantly sallies forth, followed by the Ãrial Spirit. SCENE VI. âMystical Steel Cavern. Enter principal Mufti, followed by Albert. AIRâMUFTI. Albert, mark! in this Cavern, where burns evermore The mystical flame which the Curdmans adore, Alone, and in silence, thy watch must thou take, And this thou shalt next do for Zulema's sake. Albert bows in acquiescence, the Mufti retiresâ in deep thought he paces the stage, his eye fixed on the flameâthunderâhe startsâand his ears are assailed by the following MYSTIC CHORUS without. In witching spells while speeds the night, Great Fire King! hear our pray'r; We offer up a proselyte To thy superior care. Principal Mufti rushes on, but appears struck with wonder at the continued appearance of the Scene. AIRâMUFTI. Hast thou watched, speak Count Albert, and sight hast seen none, Save yon flame burning bright on its altar of stone? Sure some spell, than our charms and our witchcraft's more bless'dâ Behold! the red-cross 'tis that beams on his breast. During this he approaches Albert, and, opening his Caftan, perceives the red-cross pendant on his breast, and demands it; the Ãrial Spirit, enveloped in blue flame, appears opposite the Mufti, and endeavours to prevent his obtaining it. DUETâMUFTI AND ÃRIAL SPIRIT. Mufti. This Sign of thy Faith to yon Flame is decreed. Spirit. Hold, Albert! the action than Death is more fell! Mufti. For fair Zulema's sake, quick accomplish the deedâ Spirit. 'Tis done, thy good angel now bids thee farewell! Mufti receives it from him, and throws it into the flame on the Altar, which brilliantly blazes forthâ the Spirit vanishesâloud peals of thunderâSteel Portals, with an immense crash, burst open, and the Monarch of Flame, superbly decorated and attended, appears in brilliant ignipotence, bearing an enchanted banner, and magic sword. AIRâFIRE KING. Count Albert thou'rt mine! behold his dire form, Whose breath is swift lightning, whose voice it is storm; Who makes each steel portal to rattle and ring, For, borne on the blast, comes the dread Fire King. I ween the stout heart of Count Albert is tame, As he views in his terror the Monarch of Flame: With this brand thou shalt conquerâthus longâand no more, 'Till thou bend to the cross, and the Virgin adore. The Fire King presents him the magic sabre, which, with terror, he acceptsâthe Soldan, Zulema, and all the Saracens enter, bowing to Albert as their Champion, Zulema and the Soldan embracing him. MUFTI. And now thou must aid us, with counsel and hand, To drive the bold Christians from Palestine's land; For her Lord and her Love then Count Albert she'll take, When all this is accomplished for Zulema's sake. The Fire King commands his acquiescence, and Albert receiving the sabre, daringly, vows to undertake the taskâthe characters all groupeâthunder, flame, &amp;c. AIRâFIRE KING. Hark! thunders growl distant, and faint gleam my fires, While, borne on a whirlwind, the Fire King retires. The Fire King waves the enchanted Banner over Albert's head, the Sabre, which he brandishes, emits fire. CHORUS OF SARACENS. Enchanted the banner that waves o'er his head, Magic flame sparkles bright on his sword; And from conquest returning, his fair bride decreed His valour and love will reward. SOLOâFIRE KING. The Red-Cross shall wax faint, and the crescent come on, Now Albert commands you on Mount Libanon. Chorus. âThe Red-Cross, &amp;c. As the Fire King ascends, the Soldan receives the banner, which he continues to wave over Albert's head; the Saracens having all drawn their sabres, and waving them in unison till the Act Scene closes the FIRST PART.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. SCENE I. King Baldwin's Grand Encampmentâthe Christian Cross fixed conspicuously on one side of the Royal Tent, which occupies the centre of the Stage, the figure of the Virgin on the other; Battering Rams, and other implements of antient Warfare mingled amidst the Tents. King Baldwin and his army discovered drawn up ready to repel the Enemy's attackâRosalie bending in adoration to the Crossâthe trumpets of the Saracens heard without, accompanied by loud shouts, which are answered by the trumpets and huzzas of the ChristiansâCount Albert in a splendid Persian dress, preceded by his magic banner, and followed by Saracens, rushes on, assails, and disarms Baldwin, to whose assistance a Christian officer hastes, and receives, on his shield, the blow destined to dispatch his Monarch, who is led off.âAlbert quickly vanquishes the Officer, and meeting Rosalie, a combat between them ensues; her Helmet is struck off and his Turban, both wounded, recognize each other, and, bending to the cross, he faintsâRosalie, agitated, and almost breathless, supports himâhe revivesâshe points to her woundsâhe views her with anguish, and kneels to her for pardonâshe raises, and leads him to the figure of the Virgin, to which he repentant kneels âthunder, &amp;c.âKing Baldwin returns re-armed to the fight; attacks Albert, who attempts to repel him, his sword flies from his grasp; the magic banner disappears, and he again falls breathless at the foot of the Cross.â(During this action on the front of the Stage, a general battle takes place in the rear;) After a short pause, Osric, with a party, rush on and bear off Rosalie, while the Soldan takes Count Albert captive; the remnant of the Saracens yield to King Baldwin and his forces. SCENE II. âA Forest. Enter Urilda and Carloman, followed by Nero, guarding themâa distant trumpet sounds, and he departs on the look outâUrilda, with tears, embraces her Boy. AIRâURILDA. By a Father deserted, whose hatred so keen Near has driv'n thy wrong'd Mother wild! These eyes view no prospect but sorrow's sad scene, Still to weep o'er my poor harmless child. Sweetest Babe, a Mother's tear, Now must be thy only cheer, Sweetest Babe, a Mother's sigh! Now must be thy lullaby. Well-a-day! a tear, a sigh, Thy only cheer, thy lullaby! For Affection's fond error, my sweet innocent! Thy birth was embitter'd with fears; Transform'd to a pillow of thorns, sweet content, And the milk thou imbibs't salt with tears. Sweetest Babe, a Mother's tear, Still must be thy mingled cheer; Sweetest Babe, a Parent's sigh! Still thy pensive lullaby. Well-a-day! a tear, a sigh, Thy only cheer, thy lullaby! Exeunt. SCENE III. âA Romantic display of wild and picturesque Scenery, consisting of stupendous Mountains, grand Waterfalls, and overhanging Rocksâan opening to a subterraneous pass on the right hand side of the Stageâpart of the Mountains practicableâNightâthe Stage dark. Enter Osric and Mauleon, bearing on Rosalie, Mauleon with a torchâthunderâlightningâa storm commencesâperceiving the entrance to a subterraneous pass, Osric places Rosalie there for shelterâ Mauleon's torch is blown out, and he wanders off to relume it, leaving Osric at the mouth of the Cave, with his sword drawn on the watchâUrilda and Child, way-worn and fatigued, enterâthe storm radually abatesâoccasional blasts of wind, &amp;c. &amp;c QUARTETTOâURILDA, CHILD, OSRIC, AND ÃRIAL SPIRIT. Urilda. Weak, weary, and way-worn, long hours have we passed! Dark night glooms around us, and chill roars the blast! Child. Oh! mother I faint, let me lean on thine arm, And close in thy mantle pray wrap me up warm. Urilda. Close, close in my mantle I'll wrap thee up warm. (She wraps him up in her mantle, and they approach the MountainsâOsric starts at perceiving them, indicating murderous intentions, but first secures Rosalie, by rolling the fragment of a Rock, so as to block up the mouth of the Cavern, occasionally concealing himself.) Urilda. Why trembles my darling, why shakes he with fear? Child. Look, Mother! fierce Osric, my Father, is near! Earl Osric, the Lion, with his sword keen and bright, Urilda. My child, thou'rt deceived by the vapours of night. Child. Ah! no, not deceived by the vapours of night. (The Child approaches nearer to where Osric is; they meet, and Osric, wrapping himself up in his cloak, with great tenderness, in a feigned voice, addresses him.) Osric. If thou wilt, dear baby, with me hie away, I'll give thee fine garments, we'll play a fine play, Fine flowers are growing, white, scarlet, and blue, On the banks of yon River, and all are for you. Child. Oh, Mother! 'tis Osric! fierce Osric, we view! (Carloman having approached within his grasp, Osric, discovering himself, indignantly seizes himâUrilda screams!) Urilda. Fierce Osric! oh, hear me! Osric. âVain, vain is thy prayer. Urilda. Cruel monster! ah, twist not thine hand in his hair, Nor aim at his bosom thy knifeâ Osric. âDeath is nigh! Urilda. One pray'r; oh! one pray'r, let us breathe e're we die. Osric. Commend thee, commend thee, to Heav'n and die! Urilda. And must my sweet babe by his Father be slain! Child. Oh! save me! Urilda. Oh! save him! Osric. âThy prayers are in vain! Relentless, no plea can induce me to spare. Spirit. Meet thy fate, then unpitied; howl, fiend, and dispair! Osric. Curse, curse on thine arm! Spirit. âHowl, fiend, and despair. During this Nero appears on the Mountains, and perceiving his Mistress and Carloman in danger, is hurrying to their assistance, when he is met and attacked by Mauleon, whom he vanquishes; then precipitates himself from an immense high promontory, and assails Osric, who disarms, and is on the point of dispatching him, when the Ãrial Spirit rushes on, snatches up Nero's sword, stabs him, and he expires âthen, waving her wand over the Cave, it opens, and Rosalie entersâall bend in thanks, and exeunt. SCENE IV. âA Dungeonâa grating in the Centre, leading to a lower Cell, in which Count Albert is imprisoned. Mufti enter, followed by Zulema and the Soldan âMufti open the grating, Albert, in chains, is drawn from his cellâstarts, horror struck, at the sight of Zulemaâshe attempts to sooth himâhe avoids her with disdainâthe Soldan threatening, half draws his sabreâthe voice of the Ãrial Spirit is heard singing the following STRAINâÃRIAL SPIRIT. In the time of thy need breathe to Heav'n a pray'r, Should Heaven deign hear such a recreant as thee; Disentangle thyself from proud Zulema's snare, And rather meet death than wrong fair Rosalie. The Soldan and Zulema once more endeavour, by promises and caresses, to allure himâhe dashes them from himâthe Father draws his sabre, and Zulema her poignard; he drops on one knee, bending in supplication to Heaven, forming the crossâthe Ãrial Spirit appears in an illumined Cloud, and, waving her wand, Skeletons bear the Soldan and Zulema through the Stage, surrounded by flame, and Count Albert throws himself, overpowered with gratitude and contrition, at her feetâthunderâa terrific chasm, backed by sulphureous flames opens, and the Fire King, in terror, again appears, bearing in his hand the enchanted sword, crimsoned with blood.âSaracen executioners rush on, and a block rises through the Stage. DUETâFIRE KING AND ÃRIAL SPIRIT. Fire King. Count Albert, once more view this magical brand, The heart's-blood of Christians have dy'd it with red; Though lately it flam'd in thy renegade hand, Kneel instant! 'tis destin'd to strike off thine head! Spirit. Hold! hold, King of terrors, Count Albert's my care, 'Ere his head at the throne of the Fire King he lay, The two first commands, which I give, thou shalt swear, (Though hard should the task be enjoin'd) to obey. Fire King. Peace, Sorceress! though proudly thou oft rid'st in air, Mine eyes furnish light'ning, my hand guides the storm, And the two first commands which you give me I swear, (Though hard should the task be enjoin'd) to perform. Spirit. Now aid me, ye guardians of Virtue's bright charms, The truest of maidens, Fire King, bid appear! Rosalie, in splendid feminine attire, arises, and embraces Albert, who, throwing off his Caftan, appears with the cross at his breast as a Christian knight. Fire King. The truest of maidens he clasps in his arms: Now give me thy second command and dispair. Spirit. Ah! be not, proud King, of success too secure; Than the truest, a truer before me now bring. Fire King. Vile hag! than the truest, fate yields not a truer! And, enrag'd, quits his prey, the defeated Fire King. SPIRIT AND CHORUS. Virtue conquers, and proudly her triumph I sing, For enrag'd quits his prey the defeated Fire King. The Chasm closes on the Fire King, and the Scene changes to SCENE THE LAST. A Superb View of King Baldwin's Palace. The repentant Albert is again received as a Christian Knight, and united, by the King, to the constant and virtuous Rosalie. FINALEâSORCERESS. Sweet Rosalie! thy envied name Shall be engrav'd in Virtue's dome; May constancy thus Vice reclaim, And lead the erring wand'rer home! And, as thy lyric tale we sing, May sighs and tears oft yield to glee; And thus o'ercome the dread Fire King, 'Plaud Albert and fair Rosalie. CHORUS. And, as, &amp;c. FINIS.</field>
