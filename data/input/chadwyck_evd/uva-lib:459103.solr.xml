Breifly &amp; playnely thus/ The first obiection to be answeared ys, that the gold &amp; Coynes of Chistendome &amp; more ?ticularly of this our kingdome is much exhausted to buy needles wares./. [In yt I must Consider] To make full answeare to this greate obiection: In the first place I will expresse the vse the needfull &amp; the necessary vse of all such wares wch vsually are brought from orientall India into Europe. To witt, drugs, spices, rawsilke, Indico: &amp; Callicoes. next I will intimate the manner &amp; the meanes, how &amp; wch wayes the foresayd wares haue heretofore been brought into Europa: lastly I will proue the Coynes of England, neyther Gold nor siluer to be Consumde, but rather much increast[e] by the ?formance of the foresayd trade./. Ad: The necessary vse of Indian wares, the meanes &amp; manner how before imported the treasure not Consumde, but much encreast. ys yt not so:? Co?: Euen so my honourd lord/ Ad: Then farely make replye. Com 1 Ist possible, to finde a man so blinde, so ignorant in any famous Co?on wealth: that will, oppose the moderate vse of [[illeg.]] healthfull druggs, and Co?fortable spices? not thereby to surfayte, or to please a lickorish taste, but rather as they are most pertinent eyther for preseruation of health, or Cure of grosse impostumde maladies. might not these Stoike snarlers, poor obiecters, as well deny [the deny] the vse, &amp; bringinge in of Sugars, wines, oyles, raysons, Currands, prunes, figgs, &amp; the like: nay wth farre greater reason, exclayme wth bitter language gaynst Tobacco, gaynst Cloth of gold &amp; siluer, Cambricks, lawnes, gaynst gold, &amp; siluer lace, gaynst Taffaties, veluetts &amp; sattens, yearely, daylie brought into this kingedome for excessiue su?es, all wch whilst wee Consume, Consume not they [reciprocally our Coyne,] (I speake of knowledge) both our wealth, and meanes? and yet the moderate vse of all these wares haue euer suted wth the maiestie of this greate kingedome, &amp; rich Co?on wealth. for Indico yt ys so excellent for the well dyinge [Clo] of our woollen Clothes so much esteemed allmost through out the world for ornament &amp; weare, that take awaye the goodnes of the dye, small sale of Cloth will be in vse, &amp; what will follow then but beggery to thousands in the land. &amp; for the importation of rawe silkes London Cannot deny but many hundreds, of poore decayed tradesmen &amp; theyr wiues (wch otherwise might suffer Cold &amp; hunger) are euery daye imployde, to gett theyr lyvinge by windinge, twistinge, weavinge of the same. yea &amp; to Cherish this greate busines his Maiestie hath graciously beene pleasd for to remitt the impost of such silkes. so that yt may be hoped yet ere longe, that industrie will make that art to flourish wth no lesse profitt to this Co?on wealth then yt hath done to diuerse other states, as Italye, the Monarchie of France, &amp; the vnited Belgique provinces: Touchinge the trade of Callicoes, tis true I will not vouch yt so Co?odious for Christendome in generall, yet for us of singular &amp; most especiall vse, not solely for encrease of forraine trade, but thereby to abate the high-raysd price of Holland, Cambricks, lawnes, &amp; lynnen Cloth Of sundry sortes, by shippinge yearely brought into this kingdome for great su?es of mony./ And this (I hope) may satisfie your honour touchinge the helpfull vse of Indian wares./ Ad- No honest man (I thinke) [will] Canne disallow of these your allegations, since they beare no feyned glosse, no Counterfayte pretext to make them seeme then otherwise they are. what, giddy, harebraynd, heady fooles are they that speake they know not what, gaynst what they know not: [Children will] but [babies,] Children still [be] are dablinge in the durt, &amp; fooles will babble though to publique hurt: Canne you, as this, proue all the rest sincere? Go: yf otherwise my honoble lord may wee incurre the high &amp; greate displeasure of his most sacred maiestie &amp; state. [Good syr proceede, And wee are ready] Co?itt: Next I must Intimate the importation of these [seuerall] Indian wares. Yf selfe opinion, or a bare report of yll affected men to publique good shall stand for wittnes,: then yt will appeare that Europes first Co?erce from India by way of naviga[vate]tion had begi?inge by the discovery of the Cape good hope. That this ys false, wittnes the many yeares (before [the] discouery of the foresayd Cape) this traffique had his ordinary Course by shipps to Mocha in th'Arabian sea, &amp; to Balsera in the Persian gulfe: from both wch places all the foresayd wares weare ouer land transported through the turkes [by] on Ca?ells to Aleppo, &amp; Alexandria, from whence agayne they weare by sea disperst as well by Turkes &amp; Christians into Europe./ by wch Continuall entercourse The Turke (the Co?on enemie of Christendome) was master of the trade, enricht his subiects &amp; filled his Coffers wth high-rated Customes./ but our discouery into India by Cape bone esperance (so much frequented as well by other nations as the English) hinders not onely the Co?erce &amp; trade the Turke sometymes enioyde, as well in Persia as in Arabia, (too no little losse,) but yt hath allso brought, (and still wee hope will daylie bringe) a further happines to Christendome in generall, &amp; to England more in ?ticular as well by ventinge Our English Cloth &amp; tyme (Co?odities wee well Canne spare) as allso by exportinge lesse quantitie of Coyne then heretofore by many thousand poundes. so then to stoppe these barkinge mouthes, wch vnder gilded termes of the weale publique (yet as much respect the publique weale as drones doe honyed bees) [doe dro] dare speake they list not where, nor Care not what to the subuersion of our Indian trade./ Ile make yt playne appeare what first the wares bought at Aleppo Cost: and what the same of the same nature, qualitie, &amp; worth Cost in East India wth the seuerall Charge./ Here might I number vp such quantities as might Confound most solid memories but by the little ?cells wch Ile name greater ?portions may be easily iudgde./. 100000l l. of pepper at Aleppo. at . 2s. ?l l. is 10000l l The same quantitie in India at . 3d. ?l l. is 1250 20000l l. of Cloues at Aleppo at . 5s. ?l l. is 5000l l The same quantitie in India at . 1s. ?l l. is 1000l l 400000l l. nutmeggs at Aleppo at . 2s. 4d. ?l l. is 46666. 13s. 4d.

The interest &amp; forbearance of the m'chant is very longe the aduenture &amp; assurance exceedinge dearer: &amp; the daylie Charge of shippinge, victualls, mariners, &amp; factors farre greater then by voyage into Turkie so that the difference thus decides yt selfe. that the materialls of the Co?on wealth togeather wth the imployment of the subiects (In lieu of readie monies) doth become a greate &amp; ample portion of the price, payd for those Indian wares: wch Cannott hurt (as many most erroniously suppose) the Co?on wealth, but greately helpe the same./ dep. This one thinge take from me (most honord lord) for a firme maxime, &amp; vndoubted truthe, that all the Persians Moores, &amp; Indians, wch haue Co?erce or traffique wth the Turkes at Alexandria, Mocha, or Aleppo, for spices, druggs, raw-silkes or Callicoes, haue allwayes made, &amp; to this daye doe make theyr annuall returnes for ready monies. for other wares there are exceedinge fewe wch they desire to buy from forraine parts./ some Chamletts, Corrall, wrought silke, woollen Cloth wth some small trifles else, they yearely vent for 40. or 50 thousand pound at most wch ys a poore invaluable su?e, to that exceedinge wealth in gold &amp; siluer brought from Aleppo into Persia./ for raw-silke onely, yearely at the least five hundred thousand pounds. agayne from Mocha, yearely at least six hundred thousand poundes in Iunkes of wondrous burthen, into India, for the returne of Sugar, Callicoes, Rice, druggs, Tobacco, Cowha, Cardamone, &amp; diuerse other thinges. so that betweene these Infidelles, Co?erce is still mayntaynd, not onely for the Callicoes, &amp; wares of sundry sortes, wch most Concerne theyr vse, but allso for the silkes of Persia wch are transported into Christendome. 2. Co?./ All this Considered (honorable syr) how matchles worthy is the enterpryse of our East Indian English, Companie who by theyr good endeavours doe, &amp; hope still more &amp; more to, turne no little part of this most wealthy trade, by shipps directly from out the Persian gulfe into our kingdome./ whereby the trade &amp; Customes of the Turke may euery daye be more &amp; more impayred &amp; Europes treasure lesse &amp; lesse Consumde as ys allready actually performde in Case of spices druggs &amp; Indico./ Ad. You all Cohere in one,: I now perceaue, (by the Coherence of the Turkish trade wth Christians, Persians, Indians &amp; the like) the meanes &amp; manner how the Indian[s] wares [wares] haue heretofore beene brought &amp; yet in part are still procurd into Christendome. Ad: Therefore no more of this: my memorie will fayle in all to heare too much of any. Co?. 1. The last thinge mentiond in the first obiection, is that the siluer, gold, &amp; Current Coynes of this our kingdome in particular ys not Consumed by th'East-India trade./ Who knoweth not (so that he will not pleade simplicitie or ignorance of purpose, &amp; yet who blinder then the selfe-willd blinde, who out of enuy will not knowe the truthe) that gold wth siluer in East India hath no [concordant price] Ã¦quiualence: nor hath the [siluer] Coyne of this our kingdome any equall valew wth Spanish Ryalls, accordinge to theyr seuerall pryzes here: besides all this, [yt ys prohibited] the transportion [by kingly power to the East Indian m'chant] of any gold or siluer of this kingdome by kingly power is prohibited to the East Indian marchants: onely this a Certayne su?e is yearely limited of forrayne Coyne, as ryalls or the like, wch as they neuer did, nor dare exceede, so haue they neuer yet fullfild the same./ ney whatsoeuer su?es of forrayne Coyne haue beene transported into India, his maiestie hath Carefully ?vided by his authentique letters pattents gra?ted vnto the brethren of that Companie, that they shall yearely import as much siluer as they export, wch truely is ?formd wth ouerplus, to the no small encrease of this our kingdomes treasure: nor i'st likely, that the sayd money thus Contracted for, at Certayne prices, and at tymes appointed to be deliuered, should be otherwise brought into England, wch the m'chant doth for the ?fomance of the Contracts made. who wthout full assurance of vent, &amp; a good price for the sayd monies sent would questionles make theyr returnes in wares the vse whereof would Certaynlie be found lesse profitable to thee Co?on wealth when all thinges rightly are Considered:/ [Saye] Saye that wee graunt one hundred thousand poundes [a yea] in ryalls, dollars, or like forren Coyne [be] yearely to be exported: [the returnes] yet tis Certayne The trade thus dryuen wth such su?es of mony will not Consume, but rather much augment the kingdomes treasure: wch [may well appeare] is truly prouude In the discourse of trade, a booke sett forth to make all mistie doubts serene &amp; Cleare. Admi/ This seemes to me a misterie indeed, for I my selfe may thus obiect &amp; saye, you bringe vs wares from India into England where are those wares Consumde,? where are they sold? are they not sold in England? or transported to Countryes farre remote, &amp; there exchangd for other wares? this Cannot be denyde in my opinion: wch yf not denyde, yt Consequently followes, that wee still doe want our hundred thousand poundes in monyes./ depu: first (honob l e. Sr.) wee must Conceaue the wares to be of little or no vse for this our kingdome, onely for so much as doe Concerne the vsefull trade thereof. In the sayd trade, wee likewise must Consider that though the goodes exported be returnde in other wares, [yet still] th'[ey] are still [yet] [imployde] negotiated vnto the augmentation of the stocke &amp; for the well-imployment of the subiects./. and lastly yf there be a resolution, to end the busines. be assured (syr) that the whole value may be presently returnde in ready monies. for I knowe in Italie &amp; Turkie, where those wares to best aduantage are most vendible there likewise is the monye allwayes free to be exported wthout Countermaund. And as yt ys a truth wthout Controule that other wares exported weare the meanes for to bringe in the hundred thousand poundes imployde (by supposition) in East India: so is there the same efficacie &amp; power in Indian wares to bringe in &amp; procure alike or greater su?e[s] of ready monies Into this kingdome: for let no man doubt, that mony still attends on marchandize: monye's the price of warÂ«eÂ»s &amp; wares agayne the proper vse of [wares] [[illeg.]nies] Coyne. I then Conclude that theyr Coherence is inseparable./ Yf any scruple [made] might be made of this thinke you the ffrench or the venetians would willingly ?mitt, each yeare at least six hundred thousand poundes of starlinge Coyne to be transported out theyr territories into the large dominions of the Turke Co?. 1. onely to buy the silkes of Persia, wch forthwth is resold for ready monies To other states for to ?forme the trade:/ whereby theyr wealth doth euery daye encrease &amp; the poore subiect, for reliefe, imployde. And doe not wee, by sale of Indian wares, in Turkey, in Ligorne, in Genowaye &amp; in Marcellis, purchase ready monies freely brought thence sans danger of the lawe, [or] no prohibition to the Contrary.?/ all wch sayd Coyne, or any part thereof yf happily diuerted from this realme by any new imployment or affayres, yt nathles must be graunted, (maugre spite) that the sayd Indian wares &amp; m'chandize [in] in ready monies had theyr finall ende. what neede I heape vp m?y argument? to proue a [matter] Cause so playne, so euident: yf search weare [found] made, yt doubtles would be found that the surmount of all our other trades, ioynde all togeather, would not Ã¦qualize the ouerballance of our Indian trade In ready monies . thus my taske is done Clearinge the first mayne-naymde obiection/. Ad: A misterie: and such a misterie that'? past all vulgar apprehension: how Ã¦nigmatique vnto Co?on sense. haue you explaynde a longe suspected truth:? I, as the vulgar, Iudgde, you seemde to me, no otherwise, then such as ill report would haue you be: but I am satisfide. Let Calumnie hereafter hold her tonge to slander those that neuer did her wronge. [ho.] I knowe your promptnes to explaine the rest, let this suffice for one dayes serious taske: another daye or two Ile gladly spend to heare the rest resolude: till then here ende. Exeunt.</field>
