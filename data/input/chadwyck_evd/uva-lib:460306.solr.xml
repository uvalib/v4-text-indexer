      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. The HOUSHOLD GOD. Lest any one should wonder who I am, I'll tell you in few words. I am the God Domestic of this family, from whence Ye saw me come. It now is many years, Since I've possess'd this house, protecting it Both in the grandfather's and father's time Of him, who now inhabits it. The grandfather, Unknown to every one, intrusted me With a rare treasure all of gold: for this He dug an hiding-place beneath the hearth, Beseeching me with pray'rs to keep it for him. He died, and was withal so covetous, He would not even tell it to his son, But rather chose to leave him indigent Than shew him this same treasure. On his death, He left his son a bit of ground, from whence He might pick up a piteous livelihood With industry and labour. Now when he Was dead, who with this gold had trusted me, I set me to observe, whether the son Would hold me in more honour than his father Had done before him: but he treated me With less regard, less honour'd and rever'd me. I did the same with him. He also died, And left a son, who now inhabits here, Of the same close and niggard disposition As was his father and his grandfather. He has an only daughter: she indeed Makes ev'ry day her constant supplications With frankincense, or wine, or something else, And gives me wreaths of flowers. For her sake Have I caus'd Euclio to find out this treasure, That, if he please, he may more readily Dispose of her in marriage; for a youth Of highest quality has made her pregnant: He knows her, who she is; she knows not him: Nor has her father learn'd, that she is pregnant. Now will I cause, that the old gentleman, Who lives here in the neighbourhood, shall ask The girl in marriage; and on this account I do it, that the youth, who made her pregnant, May find the means more readily to marry her: For this old gentleman is the youth's uncle, Who forc'd her on the night of Ceres' festival. But hark!âI hear old Euclio now within Making an uproar, as he's wont to do. He's thrusting his old woman out of doors, That she should nothing know. Belike he wants To see his treasure, if it be not stolen. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. EUCLIO driving out STAPHILA. EUCLIO. Out of my house, I say;âout of my house; Nay, but you must and shall;âout of my doors, Good gossip Pry-about,âpoking your eyes, And peering, here and there, in ev'ry corner. Staph. Why do you beat me, a poor wretch? Eucl. To make you A poor wretch;âyou shall lead a sorry life on't. Staph. Why have you thrust me out o'doors? Eucl. You jade! Give you a reason?âGet you from the door,â There,âthere.âSee how she crawls!âDo you know what? If I but take a stick in hand, I'll quicken That tortoise-pace of yours. Staph. Would I were hang'd Rather than serve you at this rate. Eucl. The beldam! See how she grumbles to herself!âYou jade, I'll tear your eyes out; I'll prevent your watching, Peeping and prying into all I do. Get farther off there,âfarther,âfarther still,â Farther.âSo,âstand there.âIf you dare to budge A finger or a nail's breadth from that place, Or if you turn your head once till I bid you, I'll send you for a schooling to the gallows.â (Aside) Was ever such a beldam!âI'm afraid, She'll catch me unawares, and smell the place out Where I have hid my money.âThe curs'd jade! Why, she has eyes too in her pole.âI'll go, And see whether my gold is as I lodg'd it,â My gold, which gives me so much pain and trouble. [Goes in. SCENE II. STAPHILA alone. Egad, I can't tell what's come to my master: He's out of his senses.âHere now in this manner He turns me out o'doors ten times a day, Ever so often.âTroth I can't imagine What whim-whams he has got into his head.â He lies awake all night, and then he sits Purring and poring the whole day at home, Like a lame cobler in his stall.âAnd then My poor young mistress, she's upon the point Of being brought to bed; and how shall I Hide her disgrace?âThe best thing I can do is To get a rope, and stretch me at full length. SCENE III. Re-enter EUCLIO. Eucl. So, soâmy heart's at ease,âall's safe within. (To Staph.) Come, hussy, get you in now,âand be sure Take care of all within. Staph. Take care of what? Will any one, think you, run away with the house? I'm sure there's nothing else to carry off, Except the cobwebs.âTroth, it's full of emptiness. Eucl. You hag of hags! Why Jove, to satisfy you, Should make me a king Philip, or Darius.â Hearkye, I'd have you to preserve those cobwebs. I'm poor, I'm very poor, I do confess; Yet I'm content: I bear what heav'n allots.â Come get you in: bolt the door after you;â I shall be back directly;âand be sure Don't let a soul in. Staph. What if any one Should beg some fire? Eucl. I'd have you put it out, That there may be no plea to ask for any. If you do leave a spark of fire alive, I'll put out ev'ry spark of life in you. If any body wants to borrow water, Tell them, 'tis all run out; and if, as is The custom among neighbours, they should want A knife, an ax, a pestle, or a mortar, Tell them, some rogues broke in, and stole them all. Be sure let no one in, while I'm away;â I charge you, even if Good Luck should come, Don't let her in. Staph. Good Luck quotha! I warrant you, She's not in such a hurry: she has never Come to our house, though she is ne'er so near. Eucl. Have done,âgo in. Staph. I say no more,âI'm gone. Eucl. Be sure you bolt the door both top and bottom.â I shall be back this instant. [Exit Staphila. SCENE IV. EUCLIO alone. I am vex'd, Whenever I'm oblig'd to be from home. I don't care to go out;âbut now I must. The master of our ward has given notice, He shall distribute money to each family. If I forego my share, and don't put in for it, They will suspect I have an hoard at home: For 'tis not likely a poor man would slight The smallest sum, and not make application. Nay now indeed, maugre my utmost pains To hide it from the knowledge of each soul, Yet ev'ry one seems to be in the secret; They're so much civiller than they us'd to be; They come up to me, take me by the hand, Ask how I do, and what I am upon.â Well,âbut I'll go now whither I was going, And make haste back again as fast as possible. [Exit. SCENE V. Enter EUNOMIA and MEGADORUS. Eun. I'd have you think, my brother, what I say Arises purely from my friendship for you, And a regard for what concerns your interest, Such as in short becomes a loving sister. I know, we women are accounted troublesome, Nor without reason look'd on as mere praters. 'Tis true, there never was in any age Such a wonder to be found as a dumb woman.â But to be serious, do but think, my brother, That I am near to you, as you to me: We should consult with and advise each other In ev'ry thing we think for our advantage; Nor should we hide from one another aught, Or hesitate through fear about communicating Whatever may advantage either party. On this account I've taken you aside, And brought you out here, to discourse with you Upon a subject that concerns you nearly. Meg. Give me thy hand, thou best of women. Eun. Ha! Where is she? and who isâthat best of women? Meg. Yourself. Eun. What I? a pretty joke, 'faith. Meg. Nay, If you deny it, I deny it too. Eun. You should say nothing but the truth, good brother. Your best of women you can pick out no-where: One is indeed worse, brother, than another. Meg. In troth I'm of the same opinion, sister, Nor shall I differ with you in that point. Eun. Joking apart,âattend to me, I beg you. Meg. Use and command me, as you will. Eun. I'm going T'advise you what will be most for your interest. Meg. 'Tis your way, sister, ever. Eun. What will bring Eternal satisfaction. You should have An heir to your estate.âHeav'n grant you may!â What say you?âIn a word, my dearest brother, I'd have you marry. Meg. Oh! I'm slain. Eun. How so! Meg. You've cut me to the brain by what you've said: Oh! you speak daggers. Eun. Poh now, prithee do As I advise. Meg. Well,âif you'll have it so. Eun. It is for your advantage. Meg. Yes, to die Sooner than marry.âLookye, my good sister, If you will have me wiv'd, it shall be only On this condition:âLet her be brought home To-morrow, and the next day carried out. On these terms you may marry me: I'm ready. Eun. I can indeed help you to one, my brother, That's very rich; but then she is not young; She's middle-aged. What say you? Shall I ask her The question for you? Meg. Shall I ask you a question? Eun. Ask what you will. Meg. Suppose a man in years Marry a woman, middle-ag'd we'll say, And she is pregnant by him, can you doubt But that the child will have the name of Posthumus? Come, come, I'll save you any further trouble.â Thanks to the Gods, and to my ancestors, I'm rich enough: nor do I value power, Pomp, honours, acclamations of the people, Ivory cars, rich robes, and purple vestments, Which by their cost may bring a man to beggary. Eun. Tell me, who is she you would take to wife? Meg. I'll tell you. Do you know our poor old neighbour Euclio? Eun. I know him,âa good sort of man. Meg. His daughter I would marry.âNay, nay, sister, Speak not a word,âI know what you would say,â She has no fortune.âWhat of that?âI like her. Eun. Well then,âheav'ns prosper you! Meg. I hope the same. Eun. Any commands? Meg. Your servant. Eun. Brother, your's. [Exit Eunomia. Meg. I'll go meet Euclio, if he be at home.â But see, he's coming hither,âwhence I know not. SCENE VI. Enter EUCLIO. Eucl. My mind misgave me, soon as I went out, That I should go on a fool's errand: therefore I went against the grain. There was not one Of all our ward there,âno one there, whose business 'Twas to make distribution of the money.â So now I'll hie me home as fast as possible, For tho' myself am here, my mind's at home. Meg. May health and happiness attend you, Euclio! Eucl. Heav'ns bless you, Megadorus! Meg. How is't with you? Are you as hearty and as well in health As you could wish to be? Eucl. (Aside) 'Tis not for nothing, When a rich man speaks kindly to a poor one. Now to be sure he knows I have got money; And therefore he's so wondrous complaisant. Meg. How are you? Eucl. 'Faith but poorly as to circumstances. Meg. If you are but content, you have enough To live upon with comfort. Eucl. (Aside) The old woman Has told him of the gold:âyes, all's discover'd:â The jade! I'll cut her tongue out, tear her eyes out, When I get home. Meg. What is it you are muttering? Eucl. I was lamenting of my poverty: I have a great girl unprovided for, And can't dispose of her without a portion. Meg. No more;âtake courage;âshe shall be dispos'd of;â I'll stand your friend;âsay what you want, command me. Eucl. (Aside) He asks and promises both in a breath: He's gaping for my treasure, to devour it.â And so he thinks to 'tice me like a dog, By holding bread in one hand, and a stone, Ready to knock my brains out, in the other! I place no confidence in your rich man, When he's so monstrous civil to a poor one: If he holds out his hand to you in courtesy, 'Tis with design to gripe you.âAh, I know 'em; They are a kind of polype, that hold fast, Whatever they once touch. Meg. Attend a while; I've something, Euclio, to communicate In common, that concerns both you and me. Eucl. (Aside) Undone!âmy money's stole,âand now he wants To enter into composition with me.â I'll in. (Going. Meg. Where going? Eucl. I'll be back this instant.â There's something I must look into at home. [Euclio goes in. Meg. I verily believe, that when I come To ask him to bestow his daughter on me, He'll think I only mean to make a jest of him. Never was man so close and niggardly! Eucl. (returning) Well, heav'n be prais'd, all's safe: if nothing's lost, All's right.âBut I was terribly afraid; Before I went in, I was almost dead.â (To Meg.) You see I am come back;âyour pleasure, Sir? Meg. I thank you.âPrithee now resolve me readily In what I ask. Eucl. Provided you don't ask What I don't chuse to answer. Meg. Tell me then, What think you of my family? Eucl. 'Tis good. Meg. My honour? Eucl. Strict. Meg. My actions? Eucl. Neither bad, Nor wicked. Meg. Do you know what age I'm of? Eucl. I know you are advanc'd in years, as also Advanc'd in circumstances. Meg. I have always Thought you an honest fellow free from guile, And think so still. Eucl. Oh ho, he scents the money.â Would you aught farther? (Going. Meg. Since we know each other, And what we are, I you, you me, I ask Your daughter for a wife; and may it prove A blessing to us all, to me, to you, And to your daughter!âGive me your consent. Eucl. O Megadorus, it but ill becomes Your character to mock a poor man thus, Who never gave offence to you or your's, Or ever merited in word or deed That you should treat me as you do. Meg. By heav'ns I come not to deride, I do not mock you, Nor do I think you merit it. Eucl. Then why D'ye ask my daughter for a wife? Meg. To serve you, And to promote my good through you and your's. Eucl. I'm thinking, Megadorus;âyou are rich And pow'rful, I am of poor men the poorest. Now if I give my daughter to your worship, It comes into my head, you'll be the ox, And I the ass. When I am coupled with you, Unequal to the load that you can bear, I the poor ass shall founder in the mire, And you the proud ox will no more regard me, Than if I never had existed: you Will treat me with disdain, and my own kind Will hold me in derision: if we separate, I shall get stable-room from neither quarter: The asses they will bite me, and the oxen Will gore me with their horns.âThe hazard's great, To quit the asses to go herd with oxen. Meg. 'Tis for your interest, the nearer you Can form affinity with men of worth And means. Accept my proffer, hearken to me, And give me your consent. Eucl. But I can give No portion with her. Meg. You need give her none. She, that has virtue, has sufficient dower. Eucl. I tell it you, because you may not think I've found a treasure. Meg. Say no more; I know it.â You'll give her to me then? Eucl. O Jupiter! I am undone! I'm ruin'd! Meg. What's the matter? Eucl. What noise was that there, like the crash of iron? [Euclio runs in hastily. Meg. They're digging in my garden.âHey! where is he? He's gone, and left me in uncertainty.â He treats me with disdain, because he sees I court his friendship. 'Tis the way of them: If a rich man seek favour from a poor one, The poor man is afraid to treat with him, And by his aukward fear hurts his own interest; Then, when the opportunity is lost, Too late he wishes to recover it. Eucl. Returning. (to his Maid within) If I don't tear your tongue out from the root, I'll give them leave to unman me. Meg. Oh, I see You think me a fit object for your sport, Though at these years; but sure I don't deserve it. Eucl. Not I indeed;ânor could I, if I would. Meg. Well, will you now betroth your daughter to me? Eucl. Upon the terms I said,âwithout a portion. Meg. You do betroth her then? Eucl. I do betroth her. Heav'ns prosper it! Meg. I say the same. Eucl. Remember, 'Tis the agreement, that she bring no dowry. Meg. I shan't forget it. Eucl. But I know your tricks: 'Tis off or on, 'tis done or not done with you, Just as you like. Meg. We shall have no dispute. What hinders but the wedding be to-day? Eucl. 'Tis best. Meg. I'll go then, and get all things ready. Would you aught else? Eucl. Nothing but what you say. Meg. It shall be done. Your servant.â (Calling at the door of his house) Strobilusâ (Strobilus enters) Here,âfollow me directly to the market. [Megadorus goes off with Strobilus. SCENE VII. EUCLIO alone. Eucl. He's gone.âYe Gods, what cannot money do! He must have heard, that I've an hoard within: 'Tis that he wants; and therefore has he been So obstinately bent on this alliance. (Calling) Where are you?âyou, that have run gossiping, And chitter-chattering to all the neighbours, That I would give a portion with my daughter? Hoa, Staphila,âI call you,âdon't you hear? SCENE VIII. Enter STAPHILA. Eucl. Make haste, and clean the vessels for a sacrifice. I have betroth'd my daughter, and to-day She marries with our neighbour Megadorus. Staph. Heav'n's blessings on't!âbut 'faith it cannot be: It is too sudden. Eucl. Silence, and be gone: See that all things be ready by the time I return home from market; and d'ye hear? Fasten the door: I shall be back directly. [Exit Euclio. SCENE IX. STAPHILA alone. Staph. What's to be done now? we are both of us, I and my mistress, on the brink of ruin. She's just upon delivery, and her shame Must come at last to light; what hitherto We have conceal'd, we can no longer hide. I'll in, and do what master order'd me Against his coming. Troth I'm sore afraid, Poor I shall have a bitter pill to swallow. [Exit Staphila. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter STROBILUS, with ANTHRAX and CONGRIO, Cooks, Musick-Girls, and others carrying provisions. STROBILUS. After my master had bought these provisions, And hir'd these Cooks and Musick-Girls, he bade me Divide them equally into two parts. Cong. In troth you shan't split me, I tell you bluntly: If you will have me whole, I'm at your service. Strob. You put a wrong construction on my words.â My master's to be marry'd. Cong. Ay? to whom? Srob. The daughter of our neighbour here, old Euclio; And therefore he has bid me give him half Of these provisions, with one Cook, one Musick-Girl. Anth. So he's to have one half, and you the other. Strob. Just as you say. Anth. What! could not he himself Make entertainment at his daughter's wedding? Strob. Pshaw! Anth. What's the matter? Strob. What's the matter, ask you? A pumice-stone is not so dry as he. Anth. And is it as you say? Strob. Be judge yourself. He's ever crying out on Gods and men That he is ruin'd, absolutely murder'd, If any smoke comes from his kitchen-chimney. Nay, when he goes to bed, he ties a bag Close to his gullet. Anth. Why? Strob. That he mayn't lose The smallest portion of his breath in sleeping. Anth. And does he stop his lower wind-pipe up For the same reason? Strob. You may credit me, As I do you. Anth. Well, well then, I believe you. Strob. Do you know further? he will even weep To throw away the water he has wash'd with. Anth. Think you, we can persuade the old curmudgeon To give us a round sum to buy our freedom? Strob. Were you to ask for hunger, he'd refuse you. When t'other day the barber cut his nails, He gather'd up and brought away the parings. Anth. 'Tis a most stingy wretch, as you describe him. Is he so sordid? does he live so miserably? Strob. A kite once stole his scrap of supper: strait Our don went howling to the PrÃ¦tor, begging him To make the thief give bail for his appearance. A thousand other things I could relate, If I had leisure.âTell me, which of you Is the most nimble-finger'd? Anth. I by much. Strob. I mean by way of cook, and not a thief. Anth. I say a cook. Strob. (to Cong.) And what do you say? Cong. I am Just as you see me. Anth. He's a paltry cook, Fit to dress nothing but the feral suppers. Cong. Why how now, rascal? dare you to abuse me? You rogue of rogues, you double, triple knave! Strob. Be quiet you.âThe fattest of the lambsâ Cong. Is seen with half an eyeâ Strob. Do you take, Congrio, And go in there. (Pointing to Euclio's house. And do you follow him. (To a Musick-Girl, and some of the Attendants. The others come along with me. Anth. In troth You have not made a fair division: they Have got the fattest of the lambs. Strob. But you Shall have the fattest of the Musick-Girls. You, Phrygia, do you go with him; and you, Eleusium, come with us. Cong. O Strobilus, You are a cunning fellow: you have fix'd me In here upon this old curmudgeon, where, If any thing be wanting, we may bawl Till we are hoarse again, before we get it. Strob. You are a blockhead, an ungrateful fellow. Would any one bestow a kindness, when 'Tis thrown away upon you? Cong. How? Strob. D'ye ask? First, you will have no crowd there in that house; And what you want for use, you'll bring with you, That you may lose no time in asking for it. Now at our house there is a monstrous crowd; Many in family, a tribe of servants, Rich furniture, fine cloaths, and costly plate. If any thing be missing (as I know 'Tis easy for you to refrain, if nothing Lies in your way) they'll cry,âThe Cooks have stol'n it; Seize on them, bind them, flog them, thrust the rascals Into a dungeon.âNothing of this kind Can happen to you yonder, where there's nothing For you to steal.âThen follow me. Cong. I follow. (Strobilus goes up to Euclio's house. Hola, old Staphila,âopen the door. Staphila. (within) Who calls there? Strob. Strobilus. SCENE II. Enter STAPHILA. Staph. What is't you want? Strob. Take in these Cooks, this Musick-Girl, and these Provisions for the wedding.âMegadorus Has order'd me to send them in to Euclio. Staph. This wedding is in honour then of Ceres? Strob. Why? Staph. As I understand, you've brought no wine. Strob. But 'twill be brought anon, when Sir returns From market. Staph. We have got no fire-wood. Cong. How? Have you no beams? Staph. Yes sure. Cong. There's wood enough then. Staph. Why, filthy rogue! wouldst have us fire the house, That you may dress the supper, and be paid for't? Cong. Nay, nay, I am not so unconscionable. Strob. Prithee now shew them in. Staph. Come, follow me. [Staphila, Cooks, &amp;c. go into Euclio's house, and Strobilus with the rest go into Megadorus's. SCENE III. PYTHODICUS. Keep a sharp watch.âI'll have an eye to what These cooks are doing.âVerily it requires The utmost circumspection to look after them, Except that I could make them dress the victuals Down under-ground, and draw it up in baskets. But then if they should eat as fast as cook; Our 'bove-stair gentry would go empty-bellied, While those below have stuff'd their guts in plenty. But I keep chattering here, as though I had No business, when our house is full of thieves. [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter EUCLIO. I would at last have found it in my heart T'have done things handsome at my daughter's wedding. I come to th'market,âask the price of fish,â I find it very dear,âlamb dear,âbeef dear,â Veal dear,ânay, ev'ry thing in short was dear: What made them dearer still, I had not money. Seeing that there was nothing I could purchase, I came away in rage, and bid adieu To the vile rascals. As I trudg'd along, I with myself reflected, âFeast to-day âMakes Fast to-morrow.â So I brought my mind And stomach to this wise resolve,âto marry My daughter with as little charge as possible. I've therefore only bought this frankincense, And these few wreaths of flow'rs, to place upon The hearth in honour to our Houshold God, That he may smile upon my daughter's nuptials. (Going up to his house) But ha! what do I see?âThe door is open! And there's a noise within! I'm robb'd, I'm plunder'd. Congrio. (within) Go borrow, if you can, a larger Pot Among the neighbourhood: this is too little; It will not hold enough. Eucl. O I'm undone! They've seiz'd my gold, they're asking for my Pot. I'm a dead man, if I don't run this instant. Apollo, come to my assistance, kill These robbers with your arrows: you have help'd me Upon a like occasion heretofore. But why do I delay from running in, Before I'm ruin'd past recovery? [Runs in hastily. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter ANTHRAX from MEGADORUS's house. (Speaking to some within) Here, Dromo, scale those fishes,âand do you, MachÃ¦rio, split that conger and that lamprey, As fast as possible,âd'ye hear?âand bone them.â I'm only stepping to next door to borrow A baking-pan of Congrio.âSee, you pick That capon clean as a young actor's chin.â How now? what means this uproar at next door? The cooks are at it, I suppose. I'll in, For fear that ours should make the same disturbance. [Goes in. SCENE II. Enter CONGRIO hastily from EUCLIO's house. Room, room, good citizens, dear countrymen, Inhabitants, and strangers, give me way, Let me have room to run, clear all the streets Before me.âNever did I till this day Go cook for Bacchants at a Bacchanal, I and my comrades are so bruis'd, so cudgel'd I'm sore all over, I am scarce alive, The old hunks has belabour'd me so lustily By way of exercise.âI never saw A man in all my life so generous, So liberal of his wood; for he has loaded Me and my fellow-cooks with sticks in plenty. Ha! I am ruin'd, I am dead, I'm done for: The Bacchanal now opens,âhere he comes, Close after me:âI know what I'm to do,â Take to my heels,âfor so my master taught me. [Going off. SCENE III. Enter EUCLIO. Eucl. Come back,âwhere are you running?âStop him, stop him. Cong. You fool, why do you bawl so? Eucl. I will give Your name in to the magistrate. Cong. For what? Eucl. Because you have a knife stuck in your girdle. Cong. Why so a cook should have. [Brandishing it. Eucl. What! do you threaten me? Cong. By good rights I should sheath it in your guts. Eucl. There's not a greater rascal breathing, one That I should take so much delight to cudgel. Cong. You need not tell me so; the thing is manifest; I know it with a witness: you have made My limbs as soft and pliant as a tumbler's. But prithee, you poor dog, what has provok'd you To treat us in this manner? what's the matter? Eucl. D'ye ask? What have I not giv'n you enough? [Going to strike him. Cong. Let me alone.âIf this head think at all, I'll make you suffer for't. Eucl. I can't tell what Your head will think; I now know what it feels. But pray what business had you in my house, When I was absent? did I send you there? I should be glad to know. Cong. Don't make a noise then.â We came to dress the wedding-supper. Eucl. Plague! What is't to you, whether I eat my meat Or drest or raw, except you are my guardian? Cong. I should be glad to know, whether or not You'll let us dress the supper? Eucl. And I too, I should be glad to know, whether my house Is safe. Cong. I wish I had my things again, Which I brought with me, I should hardly meddle With any thing of yours. Eucl. Well, say no more. Cong. But wherefore won't you let us dress the supper? Eucl. D'ye ask, you rascal, when ye have been prying In ev'ry nook and corner of my house, Made it a downright thorough-fare?âBut had you Stuck to your fire-side, as was your business, You had not had your crown split, as you've merited. But now, that you may know my mind, I'll tell you: Come but a step here nearer to the door, Unless I order you, and I will make you The most unhappy of all mortals.âSo,â D'ye know my mind now?âWhither are you going? Come back again. [Euclio goes in. Cong. Laverna be my friend! (Hollaing after Euclio) Hearkye me now, if you don't give me back The utensils I brought here, I'll expose you Before your own door.âWhat now shall I do? I have been hired for a good round sum, But it will cost me more to pay the surgeon. SCENE IV. Re-enter EUCLIO, with the Pot of Money. Eucl. Well, by my faith, this shall accompany me Where'er I go, I'll always bear it with me, Nor will I ever trust it in such danger.â (To Congrio, &amp;c.) Get ye all in, Cooks, Musick-Girls, and all; Nay, you may introduce too a whole tribe Of hirelings, if you will. Fry, stew, bake, boil, Make as much stir and bustle as you please. Cong. Faith in good time, when you have cleft our skulls. Eucl. Get you in, sirrah.âYou was hired to work, Not prate. Cong. Ha! are you there, old gentleman? I shall expect you'll pay me for my bruises: For I was hir'd to cook, not to be drubb'd. Eucl. The law is open: don't be troublesome. Go, dress the supper,âor go hang yourself. Cong. Nay prithee go yourself, Sir, if you please. [Congrio goes in. SCENE V. EUCLIO alone. He's gone.âGood heav'ns! how rash a thing it is For a poor man like me to have concern Or dealings with a rich one.âMegadorus Tries to surprize me ev'ry way whatever. Under pretence forsooth to do me honour, He sent these cooks in to purloin this from me. (Pointing to his Pot. The cock too, which belongs to the old jade, Had near undone me: he began to scratch The ground up all about, where this was buried. It so provok'd me, that I took a stick, And knock'd him on the head at once;âthe thief! I caught him in the very act.âNo doubt The cooks had promis'd to reward the villain, If he could make discovery; but I snatch'd The means out of their hands,âto say no more, I slew the dunghil knave.âBut Megadorus, My son-in-law, comes hither from the market. I dare not pass him: I must stop, and speak to him. SCENE VI. Enter MEGADORUS at a distance. Meg. I have communicated my design, Touching this match, to many of my friends: They're lavish in their praises of the girl, And say, 'tis wisely and discreetly done.â Indeed, were other men to do the same, If men of ample means would take for wives The daughters of the poorer sort unportion'd, There would be greater concord in the state, We should have less of envy than we have, Wives would be more in dread of acting wrong Than now they stand in, husbands too would live At less expence than they are at at present. The greater part would be advantag'd by it;â Though a few niggard wretches might object, Whose greedy and insatiate dispositions No law can check, no magistrate set bounds to. But 'twill be said,âsuppose this rule should hold In favour of the poor, how shall the rich, Those maidens that have portions, get them husbands? Why let them marry whom they will, provided Their portion do not go along with them. Were this the case, our girls would be solicitous About their manners rather than their portions. I would engage, that mules, which bear at present A greater price than horses, would be cheaper Than the poor sorry geldings brought from Gaul. Eucl. (overbearing) Now by the Gods I hear him with delight: I'm sure he loves Åconomy by his talk. Meg. No wife would then say twittingly,ââI've brought you âA larger portion than your own estate: âIt is but just then I should have fine cloaths, âMaids, mules and muleteers, lacquies, and lads âTo carry how-d'yes, carriages to ride in.â Eucl. How well he knows the fashions of our ladies! Would he were made inspector of their morals! Meg. Go where you will, you'll see more carriages Than in the country at a country villa.â But this is light, compar'd to other charges.â The scourer comes for payment, the embroiderer, The jeweller, the clothier, tissue-weavers, Dyers in sundry colours, mantua-makers, Perfumers, haberdashers, linen-drapers, Shoemakers, milliners, and many more, Who gain a livelihood from women's geer. Well,âthese are satisfied: a thousand others Block up your gates like guards before a prison. You pay them: these are satisfied: yet still More come, and more; still one damn'd plague or other, To teize and press you evermore for money. Eucl. Now would I fain accost him, but I fear He would cease talking of our ladies' manners.â I will not interrupt him. Meg. When you've paid These nicknack-mongers, trumpery-retailers, Comes the tax-gatherer, and demands his rate: Away you post, to reckon with your banker: He, the tax-gatherer, waits the while half-starv'd, Expecting of his money: when th'account You've settled with your banker, it appears Yourself are in his debt, and the collector Is put off to another day.âAll these, And many other inconveniences, With unsupportable expences, wait On ample portions: maidens, that come dowerless, Are ever in their husbands' pow'r; but dames With full-swoln portions are their plague and ruin. But seeâmy father-in-law before his door.â (Advancing) Euclio! how fares it? Eucl. I've been greedily Devouring your discourse. Meg. You've overheard me? Eucl. From the beginning, ev'ry word. Meg. Methinks You should be somewhat smarter, better dress'd, Upon your daughter's wedding day. Eucl. Why, ev'ry one Should cut his coat according to his cloth: Those, that have wherewithal, should bear in mind To act becoming of their birth and station. My circumstances rank me with the poor, Nor are they better than opinion speaks them. Meg. Surely they are, and may the Gods still add To what you have at present. Eucl. (Aside) Have at present! I don't like that.âHe knows what I have got As well as I myself: th'old jade has told it. Meg. Why do you talk apart? Eucl. I was considering, How I should rate you soundly. Meg. What's the matter? Eucl. D'ye ask me, what's the matter? You've undone me, Fill'd ev'ry nook and corner of my house With thieves and pick-locks, let within my doors Full fifty cooks, all of Geryon's race, Each with six hands apiece:âif Argus' self, Who was all eyes, (he to whom Juno gave Io in custody,) if he, I say, Was set to watch them, they would 'scape his vigilance. Then there's a rascal Musick-Girl among them Would drink the PyrenÃ¦an fountain dry, If it flow'd all with wine:âthen the provisionsâ Meg. I'm sure there is enough to feast a regiment. I sent a lamb. Eucl. A lamb? what sort of lamb? I never saw an animal more care-full. Meg. Careful? what mean you by a careful lamb? Eucl. Nothing but skin and bone, so worn with care. If you hold him to the light, you'll see his entrails: He's as transparent as a Punic lanthorn. Meg. I bought him to be kill'd for our repast. Eucl. 'Faith he is dead already, and 'twere best To bury him. Meg. Come, come, Euclio, I intend To take a cup with you. Eucl. I shall not drink. Meg. I'll bid them bring a cask of good old wine From my own cellar. Eucl. I'll not touch a drop. I am resolv'd to drink nothing but water. Meg. You shall be soak'd with wine, seas over, you That are resolv'd to drink nothing but water. Eucl. (Aside) I know what he designs: he goes the way To knock me up with drinking, and transport That which I hold here to another quarter. But I'll prevent him: for I'll hide it somewhere Out of the house: so shall he lose his labour And wine too in the bargain. Meg. Have you any Further commands with me? I'll go and bathe, So shall I be prepar'd to sacrifice. [Exit. SCENE VII. EUCLIO alone. My dear Pot! thou hast many enemies, So has the gold committed to thy care.â The best that I can do now is to carry thee Strait to the temple of the Goddess Faith, There hide thee.âFaith, thou know'st me, and I thee. Beware thee, that thou dost not change thy name, If I intrust thee with this charge.âI come, Good Faith, relying on thy confidence. [Goes into the Temple of Faith. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter STROBILUS, Servant to LYCONIDES. 'Tis a good servant's duty to behave As I do,âto obey his master's orders Without delay or grumbling: for whoever Seeks to demean him to his master's liking, Ought to be quick in what concerns his master, And slow to serve himself: his very dreams, When sleeping, should remind him what he is. If any serve a master that's in love, (As I do for example) and he find His passion has subdu'd him, 'tis his duty To keep him back, restrain him for his good, Not push him forward where his inclinations Hurry him on. As boys, that learn to swim, Rest on a kind of raft compos'd of rushes, That they may labour less, and move their hands, And swim more easily; so should a servant Buoy up his master, that is plung'd in love, From sinking like a plummet.âSuch an one Will read his master's pleasure in his looks, And what he orders haste to execute As quick as lightning. Whatsoever servant Acts in this wise, will never feel the lash, Nor make his fetters bright by constant wear.â My master is enamour'd with the daughter Of this poor fellow Euclio, and has learn'd She's to be married to our Megadorus. He therefore sent me hither as a spy, T'inform him of what passes.âI may seat me Close by this altar here without suspicion; Whence I can learn what's doing on all sides. [Sits down by an altar. SCENE II. Enter EUCLIO from the Temple of Faith. Good Faith, discover not to any one, That here my gold is plac'd: I have no fear, That any one will find it, it is lodg'd So privily.âOn my troth, if any one Should find this Pot cramm'd full of gold, he'd have A charming booty on't: but I beseech you, Prevent it, Faith.âNow will I go and bathe, That I may sacrifice, and not detain My son-in-law, but soon as he demands her He may espouse my girl, and bring her home. Look to't again, Faith, and again, that I May bear my gold off, safe as I have left it, Lodg'd in your temple, trusted to your faith. [Exit. SCENE III. STROBILUS, from his lurking-place. What did I hear him say?âImmortal Gods! That he had hid a Pot brimful of gold Here in this temple.âI beseech you, Faith, Be not to him more faithful than to me.â This is the father, if I don't mistake Of her my master is enamour'd with. I'll in, and rummage the whole temple o'er To find this treasure, now that he's employ'd.â If I do find it, Faith, I'll offer to you A gallon full of wine, and faithful measure.â I'll offer,âbut I'll drink it all myself. [Goes to the Temple of Faith. SCENE IV. EUCLIO returning. 'Tis not for nothing that I heard the raven On my left hand: and once he scrap'd the ground, And then he croak'd: it made my heart to jump And flutter in my breast.âWhy don't I run? SCENE V. EUCLIO, dragging out STROBILUS. Out, earthworm, out, who but a moment past, Crept under-ground, wert no where to be seen; But now thou dost appear, 'tis over with thee. Rascal, I'll be thy death. Strob. What a plague ails you? What business have you, you old wretch, with me? Why do you lug me so? what makes you beat me? Eucl. D'ye ask? you whipping-stock! you villainous thief! Not one alone, but all the thieves together! Strob. What have I stol'n of your's? Eucl. Restore it to me. Strob. Restore it? what? Eucl. D'ye ask? Srob. I've taken nothing. Eucl. Come, give me what you've got. Strob. What are you at? Eucl. What am I at?âYou shall not carry it off. Strob. What is it you would have? Eucl. Come, lay it down. Strob. Why we have laid no wager, that I know of. Eucl. Come, come, no joking; lay it down, I say. Strob. What must I lay down? tell me, name it to me: I have not touch'd, or taken any thing. Eucl. Shew me your hands. Strob. Here they are. Eucl. Shew them me. Strob. Why here they are. Eucl. I see.âShew me your third hand. Strob. (Aside) Sure the old fellow's crazy; he's bewitch'd. Prithee now don't you use me very ill? Eucl. Very ill truly, not to have you hang'd,â Which I will do, if now you don't confess. Strob. Don't confess what? Eucl. What did you take from hence? Strob. May I be curs'd, if I took any thing Belonging to you, or desired it, I. Eucl. Come, come, pull off your cloak. Strob. (pulling it off) Just as you please. Eucl. You may have hid it underneath your cloaths. Strob. Search where you will. Eucl. (Aside) The rogue, how civil is he, That I may not suspect!âI know his tricks.â Once more, shew me your right hand. Strob. Here it is. Eucl. Well,ânow shew me your left. Strob. There they are both. Eucl. Come,âI will search no further,âgive it me. Strob. What must I give you? Eucl. Pshaw! don't trifle with me. You certainly have got it. Strob. Got? got what? Eucl. So,âyou would have me name it;âbut I will not. Restore whatever you have got of mine. Strob. You're mad sure.âYou have search'd me at your pleasure, And you have found nothing of your's upon me. Eucl. Stay, stay,âwho was that other with you yonder? (Aside) I'm ruin'd! he's at work within; and if I let him go, this other will escape.â I've search'd him, it is true, and he has nothing. (To Strob.) Go where you will, and may the Gods confound you! Strob. I'm much oblig'd to you for your kind wishes. Eucl. I'll in, and if I light on your accomplice, I'll strangle him.âOut of my sightâbe gone. Strob. I go. Eucl. And never let me see you more. [Euclio goes into the Temple. SCENE VI. STROBILUS alone. I'd rather die the worst of deaths, than now Not lay an ambush for this old man's money. He will not dare to hide it here, I fancy; But he will bring it out with him, and change Its situation.âHush, the door is opening, And out he comes, the old hunks, with his treasure, I'll draw a little nearer to the gate here. [Skulks on one side. SCENE VII. EUCLIO returns, with his Pot of Money. Faith had more faith, I thought: but she has made An ass of me downright.âIf this same raven Had not stood by me, oh! I had been ruined. Would I could meet this honest bird again, That gave me this foreboding! I would give him Good words at least.âGood words, they say, cost nothing.â Now,âlet me seeâwhere can I find a place, A lonely one, where I may hide this treasure? (Meditating)âThere is a grove without the city walls, That's sacred to Sylvanus, unfrequented, Thick set with willows:âon that spot I'll fix. Sylvanus will I sooner trust than Faith. [Exit. SCENE VIII. STROBILUS alone. I'll run before him, climb into a tree, And watch where this old fellow hides his money. My master bade me wait here,âbut no matter: I'll risk mishap in quest of such advantage. [Exit. SCENE IX. Enter LYCONIDES and EUNOMIA. Lyc. I've told you all, good mother: you are now As well acquainted as myself with all Concerning Euclio's daughter. My dear mother, I now unask you what I ask'd before:â Impart it to my uncle, I beseech you. Eun. Your will you know is mine, son; and I trust I shall obtain my brother's approbation; And there is reason good, if, as you say, You us'd her unbecomingly in liquor. Lyc. You cannot think, I'd tell you an untruth. PHÃDRIA within. My pangs come onâHelp, help, nurse! I shall die! Juno Lucina, save me! Lyc. Hark, good mother! This is a further proof: she's crying out, She's now in labour. Eun. Come then, my dear son, You shall go in here with me to my brother, And I'll persuade him to forego his marriage. Lyc. I'll follow you this instant. [Eunomia goes in. SCENE X. LYCONIDES alone. I'm amaz'd Where Strobilus can be, when I had order'd him To wait me here. And yet upon reflection, If he is absent now to do me service, It would be wrong to be offended with him. I'll in then, where they sit in judgment on me. [Exit. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter STROBILUS, with the Pot of Money. The Griffins, dwelling on the golden mountains, Are not so rich as I.âOf other kings I speak not, beggarly, poor, abject fellows,â I am king Philip's self.âFine day for me! Parting from hence, I got there long before him, Climb'd up a tree, and waited to observe Where the old fellow would conceal his treasure. When he was gone, down slid I from the tree, And dug this Pot up full of gold:âI then Saw him come back to the same place again; But me he saw not, for I turn'd a little Out of his way.âAh! here he is himself. I'll go, and lay this Pot up safe at home. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter EUCLIO. I'm dead! kill'd! murder'd!âWhither shall I run? Whither not run?âStop thief! stop thief!âWho? what? I know not,âI see nothing,âI walk blind,â I cannot tell for certain where I'm going, Or where I am, or who I am. (To the Spectators.) Good people, I pray you, I implore you, I beseech you, Lend me your help,âshew me the man that took it. See! in the garb of innocent white they skulk, And sit as they were honest.â (To one of the Spectators) What say You?â I will believe You:âYou're an honest fellow,â I read it in your countenance.âHow's this?â What do you laugh at?âO, I know you all; I know, that there are many thieves among you.â Hey!ânone of you have got it?âI am slain!â Tell me, who has it then?âYou do not know! Ah me! ah woe is me! I'm lost! I'm ruin'd! Wholly undone! in a most vile condition! Such grief, such groaning, has this day brought on me, Hunger and poverty!âI am a wretch, The vilest wretch on earth!âOh, what have I To do with life, depriv'd of such a treasure? A treasure, that I kept so carefully, And robb'd myself of comfort!âOthers now Rejoice through my mishap, and make them merry At my expence.âOh! Oh! I cannot bear it. (Runs about crying, stamping, &amp;c. SCENE III. LYCONIDES entering. Who can this be, that moans so bitterly Before our house?âHa! it is Euclio sure: 'Tis he, I think.âI'm ruin'd,âall's discover'd. He is acquainted with his daughter's labour.â What shall I do?âI'm all uncertainty.â Were't best to go or stay?âShall I accost him, Or shun his sight?âI know not what to do. Eucl. Who's that, that speaks there? Lyc. I, Sir. Eucl. I, Sir, am A wretch, a ruin'd wretch, such dread calamity, Such sorrow has befallen me. Lyc. Take courage.â Eucl. Prithee how can I? Lyc. Since the deed, that now Troubles your mind, I did,âand I confess it. Eucl. What do I hear you say? Lyc. The truth. Eucl. Young man, In what have I deserv'd such usage from you, That you should treat me thus, and go the way To ruin me and my poor child? Lyc. A God Was my enticer; he allur'd me. Eucl. How! Lyc. I own my crime, I know I am to blame, And therefore come I to implore your pardon. Eucl. How durst you to lay violent hands on that You had no right to touch? Lyc. 'Tis past.âWhat's done Cannot be undone.âI believe, the Gods Would have it so: if not, it had not been. Eucl. I believe, the Gods would have me hang myself Before your face. Lyc. Ah! say not so. Eucl. But why Would you lay hands, I pray, on what was mine Against my inclination? Eucl. Love and wine Did prompt me. Eucl. What consummate impudence! How dare you come to me with such a speech? If this is right, if this excuse will hold, Why we may strip a lady of her jewels In open day-light,âthen, if we are taken, Plead in excuse forsooth, that love and wine Led us to do it.âOh, this love and wine Is of great value, if it can impower The lover and the drunkard to indulge In whatsoever likes him with impunity. Lyc. I come to beg you to forgive my folly. Eucl. I relish not these fellows, who commit A misdemeanor, and then dare defend it. You knew you had no right; not being your's, You should have kept hands off. Lyc. But as I dar'd Make the attempt, I shall have no objection To have and hold. Eucl. To have and hold what's mine, At my disposal?âand against my will? Lyc. Against your will I ask not;âbut I think, It is my right, and you yourself will find I have a just claim. Eucl. If you don't return meâ Lyc. Return you what? Eucl. What you have stol'n of mine, I'll have you 'fore the PrÃ¦tor, and commence A suit against you. Lyc. Stol'n of your's? how? where? What is't you mean? Eucl. As if you did not know! Lyc. Not I, except you tell me what it is. Eucl. The pot of gold, I say, which you confess'd You stole,ârestore it to me. Lyc. I ne'er said A syllable about it, nor have taken it. Eucl. Will you deny it? Lyc. Yes, deny it wholly: Nor do I know what gold, what pot you mean. Eucl. That which you stole out of Sylvanus' grove. Come, give it me:âI'll rather halve it with you. Though you have robb'd me, I'll not trouble you: Come then, restore it to me. Lyc. Are you mad, To call me thief?âI thought that you had got Scent of another matter, that concerns me: 'Tis of importance, and if leisure serves, I should be glad to talk with you upon it. Eucl. Tell me, upon your faith: you have not stol'n This gold? Lyc. Upon my faith. Eucl. Nor do you know Who took it? Lyc. No, upon my faith. Eucl. And if You should discover him, you'll reveal him to me? Lyc. I'll do't. Eucl. Nor will you take, whoe'er he be, A portion of the spoil, to hide the thief? Lyc. I will not. Eucl. What if you deceive me? Lyc. Then May Jupiter do with me what he will! Eucl. I'm satisfy'd.âNow tell me, what's your pleasure? Lyc. If you're a stranger to my birth and family, Know, Megadorus yonder is my uncle, My father was Antimachus, my name Lyconides, Eunomia is my mother. Eucl. I know your family.âThen what's your business? I should be glad to learn. Lyc. You have a daughter. Eucl. I have; she is within. Lyc. If I mistake not, You have betroth'd her to my uncle. Eucl. Right. You know the whole. Lyc. He has commanded me To bring you his refusal. Eucl. How?ârefusal,â When ev'ry thing is ready for the wedding? May all the Gods confound him! for through him, Wretch that I am! I've lost so great a treasure. Lyc. Be comforted: don't curse: but let us hope, That this affair will turn out happily To you and to your daughter.âSay, Heav'n grant It may! Eucl. Heav'n grant it may! Lyc. And to me too.â Now give me your attention. Never was there A man so worthless, that had done a fault, But was asham'd, and sought to clear himself. I do conjure you, Euclio, to forgive me, If all unwittingly I have offended You and your daughter: give her me to wife, According to the laws: for I confess, That on the night of Ceres' festival, Heated with liquor, and impell'd by youth, I injur'd her fair honour. Eucl. Out alas! What do I hear? O monstrous villainy! Lyc. Why do you howl thus? It is true, I've made you A grandsire on your daughter's wedding-day: She's brought to-bed, ten months are past, pray reckon. On this account my uncle Megadorus Sent a refusal. But go in, enquire If 'tis not as I say. Eucl. Undone for ever! So many evils are combin'd to plague me. I'll in, and know the truth. Lyc. I'll follow you. [Euclio goes in. SCENE IV. LYCONIDES alone. So, ev'ry thing is safe, as it should seem.â But where is Strobilus? I can find him nowhere. Where can he be?âI'll wait a while here; then I'll after the old fellow: in the interim I will allow him time to make enquiry Of the old maid, his daughter's nurse; she knows The whole affair. SCENE V. Enter STROBILUS. Strob. O ye immortal Gods! What joys, what transports have you heap'd upon me! To have a pot of gold in my possession, Of four pounds weight!âWho is so rich as I? Was ever man so favour'd of the Gods? Lyc. Surely I hear a voice. Strob. (discovering Lyconides) Ha! don't I see Lyconides my master? Lyc. Don't I see My servant Strobilus? Strob. 'Tis he. Lyc. No other. Strob. I will accost him. Lyc. Best to mend my pace. I fancy, he has been with the old woman, My PhÃ¦dria's nurse, as I commanded him. Strob. What if I tell him I have found this booty, And ask my libertyâI'll up, and speak to him. (Advancing) Sir!âI have foundâ Lyc. What have you found? Strob. Not that Which boys in play hunt after in a bean, And if they chance to find, cry out for joy. Lyc. What, at your trick of joking, sirrah? Strob. Hold, I'll tell you, do but hear me. Lyc. Well then, speak. Strob. I have found riches in abundance. Lyc. Where? Strob. A pot brimful of gold, of four pound weight. Lyc. (with emotion) What's that you say? Strob. I stole it from old Euclio. Lyc. Where is the gold? Strob. At home, sir, in a chest.â I should be glad you'd give me now my freedom. Lyc. Give you your freedom? worst of rogues! Strob. Go, go, I know your meaning;âI was only trying you.â How you snapt at it! what would you have done, If I indeed had found it? Lyc. This evasion Shall not avail you.âGive me up the gold. Strob. Give up the gold? Lyc. Come, give it me, I say, That I may render it to the right owner. Strob. Where should I have it? Lyc. You confess'd just now, You had it in a chest. Strob. Oh, I am us'd To talk thus jokingly. Lyc. (threatening) But know you what? Strob. Nay, kill me, if you please, you'll never get it. [The rest of this Play is lost. What follows is added by the Translator.] The rest of this Play is lost.] The critics universally agree, that the Supplement, which is generally printed in the editions of our author, is very inferior to Plautus both in matter and stile. It was written, we are told, by Antonius Codrus Urceus, professor at Boulogne, who lived in the reigns of the emperors Sigismund and Frederic III. Besides the poverty of invention as well as expression, it has also a most capital fault with respect to the catastrophe. The Miser is made all of a sudden to change his nature intirely; which is to the last degree improbable. Demea, it is true, in the Brothers of Terence, throws off his sordidness and rustic asperity at the conclusion, and takes up the contrary extreme; but then it is palpably done with aukwardness, and his generosity and good-humour are apparently affected. I have, however, thought fit to subjoin a translation of this supplement, such as it is, though I have presumed to add another of my own; of which I shall only say, that I have endeavoured as much as possible to imitate the manner of my author, for which reason I have professedly made use of many of his expressions. Lyc. How, rascal!âI shall find a way. Strob. You cannot.â Tie me up neck and heels; break ev'ry limb; Load me with chains, and ram me in a dungeon; Let thongs and elm-rods be my only food; You will not get the gold.âThere is a way,â Lyc. Speak, what way? Strob. Set me free: one stroke will do it. Lyc. Tho' you deserve a thousand, I consent For my dear PhÃ¦dria's sake. Go, bring the pot here, And I'll reward you with your liberty. [Exit Strobilus. SCENE VI. LYCONIDES alone. What shall I do now? With the loss of this Already he's distracted, and I fear me, Now that he knows his daughter was dishonour'd, He will suspect me partner in the plot To rob him of his gold, and think I meant To dig out for myself, against his will, A portion with his daughter.âHere comes Strobilus. SCENE VII. Enter STROBILUS. Strob. Come, come along, thou muckworm. Lyc. Whom d'ye speak to? Strob. Euclio. Lyc. He's no where here, nor any other. Strob. Nay, but he is. Lyc. (looking about) I see him not.âWhere is he? Strob. He's here. Lyc. Here? where? Strob. I've hold of him; he's here. (Pointing to the Pot) All that he has of life and soul, is here,â Lodg'd in this Pot;âthe rest is but his shadow, This is his substance; his heart's blood, his vitals; 'Tis Euclio altogether. Lyc. Peace, you rascal; Give me the Pot. Strob. Suppose you sacrifice him Upon his daughter's wedding-day.â Lyc. No trifling.â Strob. You will at least invite me to a share, I hope, Sir, of the entrails. Lyc. Give it me, I say, this very instant; or I'll make A sacrifice of you. Strob. You'll give me then My freedom, as you promis'd? Lyc. Never doubt me. Strob. Hereâtake it. (Giving the Pot. Lyc. I'll restore it to old Euclio, Who will adore me as his Joy, his Pleasure, His Jove Protector, his supreme Salvation.â I'll call him.âEuclio!âHoa!âCome forth here.âEuclio! Eucl. (within) Who calls a wretch like me? Strob. Your Joy, your Pleasure, Your Jove Protector, your supreme Salvation. Lyc. I bring you tidings of your treasure, Euclio. SCENE VIII. Enter EUCLIO. Eucl. Where is he?âhave you found him?âwhere's the thief? Where is my gold?âSpeak, is it safe? Lyc. How is she? Tell me, how fares my PhÃ¦dria? Eucl. Is it whole? Is it in nought diminish'd? Lyc. Has she bath'd? Is she refresh'd? Eucl. I'm talking of my gold. Lyc. I'm talking of your daughter. Eucl. I've no daughter, No child, no family, except my gold,â I've no relationship. Strob. Before he lost them, He had a numerous offspring. Lyc. How d'ye mean? Strob. Of yellow boys. Lyc. (to Eucl.) Lend me your serious ear. What if I find the thief, who stole your treasure, And force him to make restitution? Strob. Hold, Sir; Let me impose conditions. Lyc. Speak, what are they? Eucl. I will consent to any thing, to have My gold again. Strob. First you shall giveâ Eucl. Give! what? (Aside) I smell him, I perceive what he's about: He means to share it with me. Strob. You shall give Your daughter to Lyconides in marriage. Eucl. With all my heart. Strob. And with herâ Eucl. The old jade, Her nurse: let him take her too. Strob. You shall give A portion. Eucl. How a portion? Strob. From the Pot. Eucl. I'm dead! I'm slain!â Strob. And then, since Megadorus At his own cost has furnish'd the repast In honour of the wedding, in your turn You shall provide a sumptuous entertainment, Lamb, pork, veal, pullets, hams,â Eucl. Have mercy on us! The very sound's enough to breed a famine. Strob. All kinds of fish, cod, salmon, turbot, mackarelâ Eucl. Would you were choak'd, I say! Strob. A ton at least Of Nardine. Eucl. Peace, you rascal! Strob. You must hire A dozen Cooks, as many Musick-Girls.â Eucl. A dozen hangmen. Strob. Your relations, friends, Must be invited; the whole city ask'd;â You shall keep open house, Sir, for a month. Eucl. You shall provide my feral supper first. Strob. One more condition, and I've done: I'm sure, 'Twill please you. Eucl. Speak, what is it? Strob. You shall marry. Eucl. I'll hang first. Lyc. Prithee now what kind of step-mother Would you provide me? Strob. A staid, prudent dame, No mettlesome young flirt, but past the age Of having children; no cost to be dreaded On that account;âone that will live on little, And be a frugal house-wife;âwith a portion,â Eucl. A portion? Strob. Yes, an ample one. Eucl. How much? Strob. As much as all the gold that's in the Pot. Eucl. (Aside) That's something.â (To Strob.) Old, you say? Strob. Just ripe for Acheron. Eucl. (Aside) That's well.â (To Strob.) Will live on little? Strob. Oh, on nothing But whey and butter-milk. Eucl. Her portionâ Strob. Paid Upon the nail. Eucl. (Aside) That's good. Lyc. (Aside) I marvel much What he can mean. Eucl. Agreed:âI'll take her.âSpeak, Who is she? Strob. Staphila. Eucl. Confound you!âShe A portion? Strob. Yes. Eucl. Who'll give it? Strob. I. Eucl. What you? Strob. Yes, I. Eucl. Whence can you have it? Strob. From my own Peculiar stock. Eucl. What mean you? Strob. From the Pot. Eucl. Away,âbegone.âThey fool me to distraction!â I'll to the PrÃ¦tor;âif there's any law, Or right, I'll have him hang'd,âI'll hang you all,â Hang all the world,âand thenâI'll hang myself. [Running off. Lyconides (Shewing the Pot.) Turn, Euclio, turn, and see your treasure here. Euclio. (Turning.) O give it me! let me once more embrace it! Villain, wilt hold it from me? Lyc. No, 'tis your's; And in return you'll give your daughter to me. Eucl. Ay, any thing.âI'll give an arm, a leg, Rather than lose my gold. Lyc. You do betroth Your daughter then? Eucl. I do. Heav'n prosper it! Lyc. I say, Heav'n prosper it! Strob. Suppose you took The kernel, and gave him the shell: 'tis all He has occasion for. Lyc. (Giving Euclio the Pot) Here is your treasure Whole, undiminish'd. Eucl. (Embracing it.) O my life! my soul! My joy! my all!âNothing shall part us more. Strob. He talks of it, as tho' it were his mistress! Yet he's afraid to touch her. Eucl. O my gold! Where shall I carry thee? where hide thee?âNever Will I lose sight of thee again:âday, night, I'll have thee near me:âI'll not eat, nor drink, Nor take my rest without thee:âwhile one eye Is clos'd in sleep, the other shall keep watch. Rather than lose thee, I will dig a pit, And bury in't thee and myself together. [Exit Euclio. SCENE IX. STROBILUS and LYCONIDES. The wretch! I wish I could devise some means To plague him more and more. Lyc. Impossible.â Not Tantalus, amidst the refluent flood, Suffers such keen and cruel punishment: No tortures of the damn'd can equal what The Miser feels: Himself is his own Hell. Strob. Now, Sir, my freedom, as you promis'd me. Lyconides. (Striking him.) There,âtake it.âGo, and call Eunomia hither, And Megadorus, to the sacrifice.â I'll in.âSpectators, do not imitate The old man's nature: grudge not your applause: Be liberal, and freely clap your hands.

      <field name="fulltext">THE SUPPLEMENT OF ANTONIUS CODRUS URCEUS. STROBILUS and LYCONIDES. STROBILUS. Nay, kill me, if you please, you'll never get From me the old man's pot of four pounds weight, Which I have not. Lyc. I warrant you, I get it, Whether you will or no, when neck and heels I have you tuck'd up to a beam.âBut why Do I not rush upon the rascal's jaws, And force his breath out by the backward way? Say, will you give it me or no? Strob. I will. Lyc. You will?âBut give it now, not sometime hence. Strob. I'll give it you this instant;âbut I pray you, Let me recover breath.âAh! ah! good master, What would you have me give? Lyc. You know not, rascal? And you will dare deny the pot of gold Of four pounds weight, which you confess'd just now, That you had stolen?âHoa! where are my Slaves? Strob. Hear me awhile. Lyc. I will not hear.âHoa, Slaves! SCENE VI. Enter SLAVES. What would you? Lyc. Bring some fetters. Strob. I beseech you, Hear me, and then command me to be bound Ev'n at your pleasure. Lyc. Well,âI hear you, speak, But make dispatch. Strob. What if you order them To torture me to death, behold the consequence: You lose a slave, and then you cannot get What you desire: but had you tempted me With the reward of precious liberty, You had obtain'd possession long ago. By nature we are all born free; by nature We are all fond of freedom: slavery Is worse than any ill that can befal us. Whom Jupiter pursues with his displeasure, He makes him first a slave. Lyc. I own, there's reason In what you say. Strob. Now prithee hear the rest. The masters of our age are all too niggardly. I call them Gripe-alls, Harpies, Tantalusses: Poor are they in the height of affluence, And thirsty in the middle of the ocean. No riches can content them, not the wealth Of Midas, or of CrÅsus: all the opulence Of the whole Persian state combin'd together Were not enough to glut their hellish avarice. Masters deal hardly with their servants; these Requite the wrong by slacking of their duty: So all things are amiss on either side. Old niggardly curmudgeons lock up all, Their pantries, cellars, with a thousand keys, And bar the entrance even to their children. The servants on their part, a knavish, sly, Designing set of fellows, pick the locks, Steal, pilfer, waste, consume, and ravage all; Nor, though you torture them a thousand ways, Can you extort confession of their thefts. Thus slaves avenge them of their slavery By tricks and pranks; and this is my conclusion, That liberality makes faithful servants. Lyc. Right, but you've been more tedious than you promis'd. If I reward you with your liberty, You'll give me what I want. Strob. I will.âBut hold,â I must have witnesses. Pardon me, Sir, I have but little faith in what you say. Lyc. E'en at your pleasure; you may call an hundred, With all my heart. Strob. Eunomia, Megadorus, Let me intreat you,âplease you to step hither. Come forthâand when the business is concluded, You may return forthwith. SCENE VII. Enter MEGADORUS and EUNOMIA. Meg. Who calls us?âSo, Lyconides.â Eun. So, Strobilus.âWhat's the matter? Speak. Strob. It is no great matter. Meg. But what is it? Strob. I call'd you to be witness.âIf I bring A pot here full of gold of four pounds weight, And give it to Lyconides, Lyconides Shall make me free, and master of myself. (To Lyc.) You promise this? Lyc. I promise. (To Meg. and Eun.) Have you heard What he has said? Meg. and Eun. We have. Strob. (To Lyc.) But swear by Jupiter. Lyc. To what vile streights alas! am I reduc'd? You are too saucy; yet I will submit To do what you command. Strob. A word with you.â Our age has little faith or honesty. A record shall be sign'd, there shall be present A dozen witnesses, the time and place Mark'd by a notary; yet there shall be found A pettifogger to dispute the fact. Lyc. Prithee dismiss me strait. Strob. Here, take this stone. Lyc. (Taking the stone.) If I deceive you knowingly, may Jupiter Throw me from all I'm worth, no place of refuge Left me within the city, as I throw This stone. (Throwing it from him.) Are you content? Strob. I'm satisfy'd. I'll fetch the treasure. Lyc. Hie thee with the speed Of Pegasus, and swallow up the way In hasting back again. [Strobilus goes off. 'Tis troublesome To have a servant, that's for ever prating, And thinks he has more wisdom than his master. This fellow here of mine, e'en let him go And hang himself, I care not, with his freedom, So he but bring me here the pot of gold, That I may turn old Euclio's grief to joy, Hoping to call him father, and obtain His daughter, who is just now brought to bed In consequence of my embraces.âSee! Here Strobilus comes loaded; as I think, He brings the Pot, 'tis certainly the Pot. [Strobilus returns with the Pot. Lyconides, you see I've kept my promise: Here is the pot of gold of four pounds weight. Have I been tardy? (Giving it him. Lyc. No.âImmortal Gods! What do I see? what have I in possession? More than six hundred Philippeans, three And four times told.âLet us call Euclio out This instant.âEuclio! Euclio! Meg. Euclio! Euclio! Eucl. (within.) What is it you would have? Lyc. Come down to us.â The Gods protect you.âWe have got the Pot. Eucl. Ha! have ye got it? or d'ye only jest? Lyc. I say, we have it.âIf you can, fly hither. SCENE VIII. EUCLIO enters, and takes the Pot. O Jupiter, O Houshold God! O Juno! Ye have at length had pity on a poor, Old, miserable wretch.âMy dear, dear Pot, With what delight, what transport do I hug you! How sweet it is to kiss you!âTo embrace you A thousand thousand times, is all too little. My hope! my heart! the grave of all my sorrow! Lyc. 'Twas ever my opinion, want of money Was of all ills the greatest that could happen To lads, to men, to old men, and to all. Lads it incites to shameful practices, Those, that are grown up men, it tempts to thieve, And old men it compels to beg:âbut now I see it plain, far worse it is to have Abundance, more than our occasion needs. Behold! what troubles has this Euclio suffer'd By reason of the gold which late he lost! Eucl. Whom must I pay my thanks to, as most due? The Gods, who reverence and respect good men? Or else my honourable friends? or both? Both rather. (Giving the Pot to Lyconides. First then,âyou, Lyconides, The principal, best author of my happiness, I do present you with this pot of gold;â Accept it freely;âI would have it yours;â And with it too my daughter.âGood Eunomia, And Megadorus, both are witnesses. Lyc. Your favour I accept, and pay with thanks, Good Euclio, as you've merited: I've wish'd, And long'd to call you father. Strob. Now, sweet master, All that remains is,âyou will not forget To set me free. Lyc. Well put in mind.âBe free, As you deserve.âGo in now, see the supper, Which has been interrupted, be got ready. Strob. Spectators,âthis curmudgeon, this old Euclio, Has chang'd his niggard nature: of a sudden He's become liberal.âBe You so too; And, if our play has pleas'd you, loudly clap. There is another short supplement (the author of which is unknown) printed in some of the editions: but as it is a supplement to the imperfect scene only, and leaves the act no less defective, I have scarce thought it worth while to give a translation of it; especially as it seems totally devoid of all merit, and very faintly imitates the manner of our author. The End of the Supplement.</field>
