      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATED, IN ALL AFFECTIONATE ADMIRATION, TO WILLIAM C. MACREADY. London: April 23, 1837.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS. Charles I. Earl of Holland. Lord Savile. Sir Henry Vane. Wentworth, Viscount Wentworth, Earl of Strafford. John Pym. John Hampden. The younger Vane. Denzil Hollis. Benjamin Rudyard. Nathaniel Fiennes. Earl of Loudon. Maxwell, Usher of the Black Rod. Balfour, Constable of the Tower. A Puritan. Queen Henrietta. Lucy Percy, Countess of Carlisle. Presbyterians, Scots Commissioners, Adherents of Strafford, Secretaries, Officers of the Court, &amp;c. Two of Strafford's children.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âA House near Whitehall. Hampden, Hollis, the younger Vane, Rudyard, Fiennes and many of the Presbyterian Party: Loudon and other Scots Commissioners. Vane. I say, if he be hereâ Rudyard. (And he is here!)â Hollis. For England's sake let every man be still Nor speak of him, so much as say his name, Till Pym rejoin us! Rudyard! Henry Vane! One rash conclusion may decide our course And with it England's fateâthinkâEngland's fate! Hampden, for England's sake they should be still! Vane. You say so, Hollis? Well, I must be still I is indeed too bitter that one man, Any one man's mere presence, should suspend England's combined endeavour: little need To name him! Rudyard. For you are his brother, Hollis! Hampden. Shame on you, Rudyard! time to tell him that, When he forgets the Mother of us all. Rudyard. Do I forget her? Hampden. You talk idle hate Against her foe: is that so strange a thing? Is hating Wentworth all the help she needs? A Puritan. The Philistine strode, cursing as he went: But Davidâfive smooth pebbles from the brook Within his scrip . . . Rudyard. Be you as still as David! Fiennes. Here's Rudyard not ashamed to wag a tongue Stiff with ten years' disuse of Parliaments; Why, when the last sat, Wentworth sat with us! Rudyard. Let's hope for news of them now he returnsâ He that was safe in Ireland, as we thought! âBut I'll bide Pym's coming. Vane. Now, by Heaven Then may be cool who can, silent who willâ Some have a gift that way! Wentworth is here, Here, and the King 's safe closeted with him Ere this. And when I think on all that's past Since that man left us, how his single arm Rolled the advancing good of England back And set the woeful past up in its place, Exalting Dagon where the Ark should be,â How that man has made firm the fickle King (Hampden, I will speak out!)âin aught he feared To venture on before; taught tyranny Her dismal trade, the use of all her tools, To ply the scourge yet screw the gag so close That strangled agony bleeds mute to deathâ How he turns Ireland to a private stage For training infant villanies, new ways Of wringing treasure out of tears and blood, Unheard oppressions nourished in the dark To try how much man's nature can endure âIf he dies under it, what harm? if not, Why, one more trick is added to the rest Worth a king's knowing, and what Ireland bears England may learn to bear:âhow all this while That man has set himself to one dear task, The bringing Charles to relish more and more Power, power without law, power and blood too âCan I be still? Hampden. For that you should be still. Vane. Oh Hampden, then and now! The year he left us, The People in full Parliament could wrest The Bill of Rights from the reluctant King; And now, he'll find in an obscure small room A stealthy gathering of great-hearted men That take up England's cause: England is here! Hampden. And who despairs of England? Rudyard. That do I, If Wentworth comes to rule her. I am sick To think her wretched masters, Hamilton, The muckworm Cottington, the maniac Laud, May yet be longed-for back again. I say, I do despair. Vane. And, Rudyard, I'll say thisâ Which all true men say after me, not loud But solemnly and as you'd say a prayer! This King, who treads our England underfoot, Has just so much . . . it may be fear or craft, As bids him pause at each fresh outrage; friends, He needs some sterner hand to grasp his own, Some voice to ask, âWhy shrink? Am I not by?â Now, one whom England loved for serving her, Found in his heart to say, âI know where best âThe iron heel shall bruise her, for she leans âUpon me when you trample.â Witness, you! So Wentworth heartened Charles, so England fell. But inasmuch as life is hard to take From England . . . Many Voices. Go on, Vane! 'T is well said, Vane! Vane. âWho has not so forgotten Runnymead!â Voices. 'T is well and bravely spoken, Vane! Go on! Vane. âThere are some little signs of late she knows The ground no place for her. She glances round, Wentworth has dropped the hand, is gone his way On other service: what if she arise? No! the King beckons, and beside him stands The same bad man once more, with the same smile And the same gesture. Now shall England crouch. Or catch at us and rise? Voices. The Renegade! Haman! Ahithophel! Hampden. Gentlemen of the North, It was not thus the night your claims were urged, And we pronounced the League and Covenant, The cause of Scotland, England's cause as well: Vane there, sat motionless the whole night through. Vane. Hampden! Fiennes. Stay, Vane! Loudon. Be just and patient, Vane! Vane. Mind how you counsel patience, Loudon! you Have still a Parliament, and this your League To back it; you are free in Scotland still: While we are brothers, hope's for England yet. But know you wherefore Wentworth comes? to quench This last of hopes? that he brings war with him? Know you the man's self? what he dares? Loudon. We know, All knowâ't is nothing new. Vane. And what 's new, then, In calling for his life? Why, Pym himselfâ You must have heardâere Wentworth dropped our cause He would see Pym first; there were many more Strong on the people's side and friends of his, Eliot that's dead, Rudyard and Hampden here, But for these Wentworth cared not; only, Pym He would seeâPym and he were sworn, 't is said, To live and die together; so, they met At Greenwich. Wentworth, you are sure, was long, Specious enough, the devil's argument Lost nothing on his lips; he'd have Pym own A patriot could not play a purer part Than follow in his track; they two combined Might put down England. Well, Pym heard him out; One glanceâyou know Pym's eyeâone word was all: âYou leave us, Wentworth! while your head is on, âI'll not leave you.â Hampden. Has he left Wentworth, then? Has England lost him? Will you let him speak, Or put your crude surmises in his mouth? Away with this! Will you have Pym or Vane? Voices. Wait Pym's arrival! Pym shall speak. Hampden. Meanwhile Let Loudon read the Parliament's report From Edinburgh: our last hope, as Vane says, Is in the stand it makes. Loudon! Vane. No, no! Silent I can be: not indifferent! Hampden. Then each keep silence, praying God to spare His anger, cast not England quite away In this her visitation! A Puritan. Seven years long The Midianite drove Israel into dens And caves. Till God sent forth a mighty man, Pym enters. Even Gideon! Pym. Wentworth's come: nor sickness, care, The ravaged body nor the ruined soul, More than the winds and waves that beat his ship, Could keep him from the King. He has not reached Whitehall: they've hurried up a Council there To lose no time and find him work enough. Where's Loudon? your Scots' Parliament . . . Loudon. Holds firm: We were about to read reports. Pym. The King Has just dissolved your Parliament. Loudon and other Scots. Great God! An oath-breaker! Stand by us, England, then! Pym. The King's too sanguine; doubtless Wentworth's here; But still some little form might be kept up. Hampden. Now speak, Vane! Rudyard, you had much to say! Hollis. The rumour 's false, then . . . Pym. Ay, the Court gives out His own concerns have brought him back: I know 'T is the King calls him. Wentworth supersedes The tribe of Cottingtons and Hamiltons Whose part is played; there's talk enough, by this,â Merciful talk, the King thinks: time is now To turn the record's last and bloody leaf Which, chronicling a nation's great despair, Tells they were long rebellious, and their lord Indulgent, till, all kind expedients tried, He drew the sword on them and reigned in peace. Laud's laying his religion on the Scots Was the last gentle entry: the new page Shall run, the King thinks, âWentworth thrust it down âAt the sword's point.â A Puritan. I'll do your bidding, Pym, England's and God'sâone blow! Pym. A goodly thingâ We all say, friends, it is a goodly thing To right that England. Heaven grows dark above: Let's snatch one moment ere the thunder fall, To say how well the English spirit comes out Beneath it! All have done their best, indeed, From lion Eliot, that grand Englishman, To the least here: and who, the least one here, When she is saved (for her redemption dawns Dimly, most dimly, but it dawnsâit dawns) Who'd give at any price his hope away Of being named along with the Great Men? We would notâno, we would not give that up! Hampden. And one name shall be dearer than all names. When children, yet unborn, are taught that name After their fathers',âtaught what matchless man . . . Pym. . . . Saved England? What if Wentworth's should be still That name? Rudyard and others. We have just said it, Pym! His death Saves her! We said itâthere's no way beside! I'll do God's bidding, Pym! They struck down Joab And purged the land. Vane. No villanous striking-down! Rudyard. No, a calm vengeance: let the whole land rise And shout for it. No Feltons! Pym. Rudyard, no! England rejects all Feltons; most of all Since Wentworth . . . Hampden, say the trust again Of England in her servantsâbut I'll think You know me, all of you. Then, I believe, Spite of the past, Wentworth rejoins you, friends! Vane and others. Wentworth? Apostate! Judas! Double-dyed A traitor! Is it Pym, indeed . . . Pym. . . . Who says Vane never knew that Wentworth, loved that man, Was used to stroll with him, arm locked in arm, Along the streets to see the people pass, And read in every island-countenance Fresh argument for God against the King,â Never sat down, say, in the very house Where Eliot's brow grew broad with noble thoughts, (You've joined us, HampdenâHollis, you as well,) And then left talking over Gracchus' death . . . Vane. To frame, we know it well, the choicest clause In the Petition of Right: he framed such clause One month before he took at the King's hand His Northern Presidency, which that Bill Denounced. Pym. Too true! Never more, never more Walked we together! Most alone I went. I have had friendsâall here are fast my friendsâ But I shall never quite forget that friend. And yet it could not but be real in him! You, Vane,âyou, Rudyard, have no right to trust To Wentworth: but can no one hope with me? Hampden, will Wentworth dare shed English blood Like water? Hampden. Ireland is Aceldama. Pym. Will he turn Scotland to a hunting-ground To please the King, now that he knows the King? The People or the King? and that King, Charles! Hampden. Pym, all here know you: you'll not set your heart On any baseless dream. But say one deed Of Wentworth's since he left us . . . [Shouting without. Vane There! he comes, And they shout for him! Wentworth's at Whitehall, The King embracing him, now, as we speak, And he, to be his match in courtesies, Taking the whole war's risk upon himself, Now, while you tell us here how changed he is! Hear you? Pym. And yet if 't is a dream, no more, That Wentworth chose their side, and brought the King To love it as though Laud had loved it first, And the Queen after;âthat he led their cause Calm to success, and kept it spotless through, So that our very eyes could look upon The travail of our souls, and close content That violence, which something mars even right Which sanctions it, had taken off no grace From its serene regard. Only a dream! Hampden. We meet here to accomplish certain good By obvious means, and keep tradition up Of free assemblages, else obsolete, In this poor chamber: nor without effect Has friend met friend to counsel and confirm, As, listening to the beats of England's heart, We spoke its wants to Scotland's prompt reply By these her delegates. Remains alone That word grow deed, as with God's help it shallâ But with the devil's hindrance, who doubts too? Looked we or no that tyranny should turn Her engines of oppression to their use? Whereof, suppose the worst be Wentworth hereâ Shall we break off the tactics which succeed In drawing out our formidablest foe, Let bickering and disunion take their place? Or count his presence as our conquest's proof, And keep the old arms at their steady play? Proceed to England's work! Fiennes, read the list! Fiennes. Ship-money is refused or fiercely paid In every county, save the northern parts Where Wentworth's influence . . . [Shouting. Vane. I, in England's name, Declare her work, this way, at end! Till now, Up to this moment, peaceful strife was best. We English had free leave to think; till now, We had a shadow of a Parliament In Scotland. But all's changed: they change the first, They try brute-force for law, they, first of all . . . Voices. Good! Talk enough! The old true hearts with Vane! Vane. Till we crush Wentworth for her, there's no act Serves England! Voices. Vane for England! Pym. Pym should be Something to England. I seek Wentworth, friends. Scene II. âWhitehall. Lady Carlisle and Wentworth. Wentworth. And the King? Lady Carlisle. Wentworth, lean on me! Sit then! I'll tell you all; this horrible fatigue Will kill you. Wentworth. No;âor, Lucy, just your arm; I'll not sit till I've cleared this up with him: After that, rest. The King? Lady Carlisle. Confides in you. Wentworth. Why? or, why now?âThey have kind throats, the knaves! Shout for meâthey! Lady Carlisle. You come so strangely soon: Yet we took measures to keep off the crowdâ Did they shout for you? Wentworth. Wherefore should they not? Does the King take such measures for himself? Beside, there's such a dearth of malcontents, You say! Lady Carlisle. I said but few dared carp at you. Wentworth. At me? at us, I hope! The King and I He's surely not disposed to let me bear The fame away from him of these late deeds In Ireland? I am yet his instrument Be it for well or ill? He trusts me, too! Lady Carlisle. The King, dear Wentworth, purposes, I said, To grant you, in the face of all the Court . . . Wentworth. All the Court! Evermore the Court about us! Savile and Holland, Hamilton and Vane About us,âthen the King will grant meâwhat? That he for once put these aside and sayâ âTell me your whole mind, Wentworth!â Lady Carlisle. You professed You would be calm. Wentworth. Lucy, and I am calm! How else shall I do all I come to do, Broken, as you may see, body and mind, How shall I serve the King? Time wastes meanwhile, You have not told me half. His footstep! No. Quick, then, before I meet him,âI am calmâ Why does the King distrust me? Lady Carlisle. He does not Distrust you. Wentworth. Lucy, you can help me; you Have even seemed to care for me: one word! Is it the Queen? Lady Carlisle. No, not the Queen: the party That poisons the Queen's ear, Savile and Holland. Wentworth. I know, I know: old Vane, too, he's one too? Go onâand he's made Secretary. Well? Or leave them out and go straight to the charge The charge! Lady Carlisle. Oh, there's no charge, no precise charge; Only they sneer, make light ofâone may say, Nibble at what you do. Wentworth. I know! but Lucy, I reckoned on you from the first!âGo on! âWas sure could I once see this gentle friend When I arrived, she'd throw an hour away To help her . . . what am I? Lady Carlisle. You thought of me, Dear Wentworth? Wentworth. But go on! The party here! Lady Carlisle. They do not think your Irish government Of that surpassing value . . . Wentworth. The one thing Of value! The one service that the crown May count on! All that keeps these very Vanes In power, to vex meânot that they do vex, Only it might vex some to hear that service Decried, the sole support that's left the King! Lady Carlisle. So the Archbishop says. Wentworth. Ah? well, perhaps The only hand held up in my defence May be old Laud's! These Hollands then, these Saviles Nibble? They nibble?âthat's the very word! Lady Carlisle. Your profit in the Customs, Bristol says, Exceeds the due proportion: while the tax . . . Wentworth. Enough! 'tis too unworthy,âI am not So patient as I thought. What's Pym about? Lady Carlisle. Pym? Wentworth. Pym and the People. Lady Carlisle. Oh, the Faction! Extinctâof no account: there'll never be Another Parliament. Wentworth. Tell Savile that! You may knowâ(ay, you doâthe creatures here Never forget!) that in my earliest life I was not . . . much that I am now! The King May take my word on points concerning Pym Before Lord Savile's, Lucy, or if not, I bid them ruin their wise selves, not me, These Vanes and Hollands! I'll not be their tool Who might be Pym's friend yet. But there's the King Where is he? Lady Carlisle. Just apprised that you arrive. Wentworth. And why not here to meet me? I was told He sent for me, nay, longed for me. Lady Carlisle. Because,â He is now . . . I think a Council's sitting now About this Scots affair. Wentworth. A Council sits? They have not taken a decided course Without me in the matter? Lady Carlisle. I should say . . . Wentworth. The war? They cannot have agreed to that? Not the Scots' war?âwithout consulting meâ Me, that am here to show how rash it is, How easy to dispense with?âAh, you too Against me! well,âthe King may take his time. âForget it, Lucy! Cares make peevish: mine Weigh me (but't is a secret) to my grave. Lady Carlisle. For life or death I am your own, dear friend! [Goes out. Wentworth. Heartless! but all are heartless here. Go now, Forsake the People! I did not forsake The People: they shall know it, when the King Will trust me!âwho trusts all beside at once, While I have not spoke Vane and Savile fair, And am not trusted: have but saved the throne: Have not picked up the Queen's glove prettily, And am not trusted. But he'll see me now. Weston is dead: the Queen's half English nowâ More English: one decisive word will brush These insects from . . . the step I know so well! The King! But now, to tell him . . . noâto ask What's in me he distrusts:âor, best begin By proving that this frightful Scots affair Is just what I foretold. So much to say, And the flesh fails, now, and the time is come, And one false step no way to be repaired. You were avenged, Pym, could you look on me. Pym enters. Wentworth. I little thought of you just then. Pym. No? I Think always of you, Wentworth. Wentworth. The old voice! I wait the King, sir. Pym. Trueâyou look so pale! A Council sits within; when that breaks up He'll see you. Wentworth. Sir, I thank you. Pym. Oh, thank Laud! You know when Laud once gets on Church affairs The case is desperate: he'll not be long To-day: he only means to prove, to-day, We English all are mad to have a hand In butchering the Scots for serving God After their fathers' fashion: only that! Wentworth. Sir, keep your jests for those who relish them! (Does he enjoy their confidence?) 'T is kind To tell me what the Council does. Pym. You grudge That I should know it had resolved on war Before you came? no need: you shall have all The credit, trust me! Wentworth. Have the Council daredâ They have not dared . . . that isâI know you not. Farewell, sir: times are changed. Pym. âSince we two met At Greenwich? Yes: poor patriots though we be, You cut a figure, makes some slight return For your exploits in Ireland! Changed indeed, Could our friend Eliot look from out his grave! Ah Wentworth, one thing for acquaintance' sake, Just to decide a question; have you, now, Felt your old self since you forsook us? Wentworth. Sir! Pym. Spare me the gesture! you misapprehend. Think not I mean the advantage is with me. I was about to say that, for my part, I never quite held up my head since thenâ Was quite myself since then: for first, you see I lost all credit after that event With those who recollect how sure I was Wentworth would outdo Eliot on our side. Forgive me: Savile, old Vane, Holland here, Eschew plain-speaking: 't is a trick I keep. Wentworth. How, when, where, Savile, Vane, and Holland speak, Plainly or otherwise, would have my scorn, All of my scorn, sir . . . Pym. . . . Did not my poor thoughts Claim somewhat? Wentworth. Keep your thoughts! believe the King Mistrusts me for their prattle, all these Vanes And Saviles! make your mind up, o' God's love, That I am discontented with the King! Pym. Why, you may be: I should be, that I know, Were I like you. Wentworth. Like me? Pym. I care not much For titles: our friend Eliot died no lord, Hampden's no lord, and Savile is a lord; But you care, since you sold your soul for one. I can't think, therefore, your soul's purchaser Did well to laugh you to such utter scorn When you twice prayed so humbly for its price, The thirty silver pieces . . . I should say, The Earldom you expected, still expect, And may. Your letters were the movingest! Console yourself: I've borne him prayers just now From Scotland not to be oppressed by Laud, Words moving in their way: he'll pay, be sure, As much attention as to those you sent. Wentworth. False, sir! Who showed them you? Suppose it so, The King did very well . . . nay, I was glad When it was shown me: I refused, the first! John Pym, you were my friendâforbear me once! Pym. Oh, Wentworth, ancient brother of my soul, That all should come to this! Wentworth. Leave me! Pym. My friend, Why should I leave you? Wentworth. To tell Rudyard this, And Hampden this! Pym. Whose faces once were bright At my approach, now sad with doubt and fear, Because I hope in youâyes, Wentworth, you Who never mean to ruin Englandâyou Who shake off, with God's help, an obscene dream In this Ezekiel chamber, where it crept Upon you first, and wake, yourself, your true And proper self, our Leader, England's Chief, And Hampden's friend! This is the proudest day! Come, Wentworth! Do not even see the King! The rough old room will seem itself again! We'll both go in together: you've not seen Hampden so long: come: and there's Fiennes: you'll have To know young Vane. This is the proudest day! [The King enters. Wentworth lets fall Pym's hand. Charles. Arrived, my lord?âThis gentleman, we know Was your old friend. The Scots shall be informed What we determine for their happiness. [Pym goes out. You have made haste, my lord. Wentworth. Sir, I am come . . . Charles. To see an old familiarânay, 't is well; Aid us with his experience: this Scots' League And Covenant spreads too far, and we have proofs That they intrigue with France: the Faction too, Whereof your friend there is the head and front, Abets them,âas he boasted, very like. Wentworth. Sir, trust me! but for this once, trust me, sir! Charles. What can you mean? Wentworth. That you should trust me, sir! Ohânot for my sake! but't is sad, so sad That for distrusting me, you sufferâyou Whom I would die to serve: sir, do you think That I would die to serve you? Charles. But rise, Wentworth! Wentworth. What shall convince you? What does Savile do To prove him . . . Ah, one can't tear out one's heart And show it, how sincere a thing it is! Charles. Have I not trusted you? Wentworth. Say aught but that! There is my comfort, mark you: all will be So different when you trust meâas you shall! It has not been your fault,âI was away, Mistook, maligned, how was the King to know? I am here, nowâhe means to trust me, nowâ All will go on so well! Charles. Be sure I doâ I've heard that I should trust you: as you came, Your friend, the Countess, told me . . . Wentworth. No,âhear nothingâ Be told nothing about me!âyou're not told Your right-hand serves you, or your children love you! Charles. You love me, Wentworth: rise! Wentworth. I can speak now. I have no right to hide the truth. 'T is I Can save you: only I. Sir, what must be? Charles. Since Laud's assured (the minutes are within) âLoath as I am to spill my subjects' blood . . . Wentworth. That is, he'll have a war: what's done is done! Charles. They have intrigued with France; that's clear to Laud. Wentworth. Has Laud suggested any way to meet The war's expense? Charles. He'd not decide so far Until you joined us. Wentworth. Most considerate! He's certain they intrigue with France, these Scots? The People would be with us. Charles. Pym should know. Wentworth. The People for usâwere the People for us! Sir, a great thought comes to reward your trust: Summon a Parliament! in Ireland first, Then, here. Charles. In truth? Wentworth. That saves us! that puts off The war, gives time to right their grievancesâ To talk with Pym. I know the Faction, as Laud styles it, tutors Scotland: all their plans Suppose no Parliament: in calling one You take them by surprise. Produce the proofs Of Scotland's treason; then bid England help: Even Pym will not refuse. Charles. You would begin With Ireland? Wentworth. Take no care for that: that's sure To prosper. Charles. You shall rule me. You were best Return at once: but take this ere you go! Now, do I trust you? You're an Earl: my Friend Of Friends: yes, while . . . You hear me not! Wentworth. Say it all o'er againâbut once again: The first was for the music: once again! Charles. Strafford, my friend, there may have been reports, Vain rumours. Henceforth touching Strafford is To touch the apple of my sight: why gaze So earnestly? Wentworth. I am grown young again, And foolish. What was it we spoke of? Charles. Ireland, The Parliament,â Wentworth. I may go when I will? âNow? Charles. Are you tired so soon of us? Wentworth. My King! But you will not so utterly abhor A Parliament? I'd serve you any way. Charles. You said just now this was the only way. Wentworth. Sir, I will serve you. Charles. Strafford, spare yourself: You are so sick, they tell me. Wentworth. 'T is my soul That's well and prospers now. This Parliamentâ We'll summon it, the English oneâI'll care For everything. You shall not need them much. Charles. If they prove restive . . . Wentworth. I shall be with you. Charles. Ere they assemble? Wentworth. I will come, or else Deposit this infirm humanity I' the dust. My whole heart stays with you, my King! [As Wentworth goes out, the Queen enters. Charles. That man must love me. Queen. Is it over then? Why, he looks yellower than ever! Well, At least we shall not hear eternally Of serviceâservices: he's paid at least. Charles. Not done with: he engages to surpass All yet performed in Ireland. Queen. I had thought Nothing beyond was ever to be done. The war, Charlesâwill he raise supplies enough? Charles. We've hit on an expedient; he . . . that is, I have advised . . . we have decided on The callingâin Irelandâof a Parliament. Queen. O truly! You agree to that? Is that The first fruit of his counsel? But I guessed As much. Charles. This is too idle, Henriette! I should know best. He will strain every nerve, And once a precedent established . . . Queen. Notice How sure he is of a long term of favour! He'll see the next, and the next after that; No end to Parliaments! Charles. Well, it is done. He talks it smoothly, doubtless. If, indeed, The Commons here . . . Queen. Here! you will summon them Here? Would I were in France again to see A King! Charles. But, Henriette . . . Queen. Oh, the Scots see clear! Why should they bear your rule? Charles. But listen, sweet! Queen. Let Wentworth listenâyou confide in him! Charles. I do not, love,âI do not so confide! The Parliament shall never trouble us . . . Nay, hear me! I have schemes, such schemes: we'll buy The leaders off: without that, Wentworth's counsel Had ne'er prevailed on me. Perhaps I call it To have excuse for breaking it for ever, And whose will then the blame be? See you not? Come, dearest!âlook, the little fairy, now, That cannot reach my shoulder! Dearest, come!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. â(As in Act I. Scene I.) The same Party enters. Rudyard. Twelve subsidies! Vane. Oh Rudyard, do not laugh At least! Rudyard. True: Strafford called the Parliamentâ 'T is he should laugh! A Puritan. Out of the serpent's root Comes forth a cockatrice. Fiennes. âA stinging one, If that's the Parliament: twelve subsidies! A stinging one! but, brother, where's your word For Strafford's other nest-egg, the Scots' war? The Puritan. His fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. Fiennes. Shall be? It chips the shell, man; peeps abroad. Twelve subsidies!âWhy, how now, Vane? Rudyard. Peace, Fiennes! Fiennes. Ah?âBut he was not more a dupe than I, Or you, or any here, the day that Pym Returned with the good news. Look up, friend Vane! We all believed that Strafford meant us well In summoning the Parliament. Hampden enters. Vane. Now, Hampden, Clear me! I would have leave to sleep again: I'd look the People in the face again: Clear me from having, from the first, hoped, dreamed Better of Strafford Hampden. You may grow one day A steadfast light to England Henry Vane! Rudyard. Meantime, by flashes I make shift to see Strafford revived our Parliaments; before, War was but talked of; there's an army, now: Still, we've a Parliament! Poor Ireland bears Another wrench (she dies the hardest death!)â Why, speak of it in Parliament! and lo, 'T is spoken, so console yourselves! Fiennes. The jest! We clamoured, I suppose, thus long, to win The privilege of laying on our backs A sorer burden than the King dares lay! Rudyard. Mark now: we meet at length, complaints pour in From every county, all the land cries out On loans and levies, curses ship-money, Calls vengeance on the Star Chamber; we lend An ear. âAy, lend them all the ears you have!â Puts in the King; âmy subjects, as you find, âAre fretful, and conceive great things of you. âJust listen to them, friends; you'll sanction me âThe measures they most wince at, make them yours, âInstead of mine, I know: and, to begin, âThey say my levies pinch them,âraise me straight âTwelve subsidies!â Fiennes. All England cannot furnish Twelve subsidies! Hollis. But Strafford, just returned From Irelandâwhat has he to do with that? How could he speak his mind? He left before The Parliament assembled. Pym, who knows Strafford . . . Rudyard. Would I were sure we know ourselves! What is for good, what, badâwho friend, who foe! Hollis. Do you count Parliaments no gain? Rudyard. A gain? While the King's creatures overbalance us? âThere's going on, beside, among ourselves A quiet, slow, but most effectual course Of buying over, sapping, leavening The lump till all is leaven. Glanville's gone. I'll put a case; had not the Court declared That no sum short of just twelve subsidies Will be accepted by the Kingâour House, I say, would have consented to that offer To let us buy off ship-money! Hollis. Most like, If, say, six subsidies will buy it off, The House . . . Rudyard. Will grant them! Hampden, do you hear? Congratulate with me! the King's the king, And gains his point at lastâour own assent To that detested tax? All's over, then! There's no more taking refuge in this room, Protesting, âLet the King do what he will, âWe, England, are no party to our shame: âOur day will come!â Congratulate with me! Pym enters. Vane. Pym, Strafford called this Parliament, you say, But we'll not have our Parliaments like those In Ireland, Pym! Rudyard. Let him stand forth, your friend! One doubtful act hides far too many sins; It can be stretched no more, and, to my mind, Begins to drop from those it covered. Other Voices. Good! Let him avow himself! No fitter time! We wait thus long for you. Rudyard. Perhaps, too long! Since nothing but the madness of the Court, In thus unmasking its designs at once, Has saved us from betraying England. Stayâ This Parliament is Strafford's: let us vote Our list of grievances too black by far To suffer talk of subsidies: or best, That ship-money's disposed of long ago By England: any vote that's broad enough: And then let Strafford, for the love of it, Support his Parliament! Vane. And vote as well No war to be with Scotland! Hear you, Pym? We'll vote, no war! No part nor lot in it For England! Many Voices. Vote, no war! Stop the new levies! No Bishops' war! At once! When next we meet! Pym. Much more when next we meet! Friends, which of you Since first the course of Strafford was in doubt, Has fallen the most away in soul from me? Vane. I sat apart, even now under God's eye, Pondering the words that should denounce you, Pym, In presence of us all, as one at league With England's enemy. Pym. You are a good And gallant spirit, Henry. Take my hand And say you pardon me for all the pain Till now! Strafford is wholly ours. Many Voices. Sure? sure? Pym. Most sure: for Charles dissolves the Parliament While I speak here. âAnd I must speak, friends, now! Strafford is ours. The King detects the change, Casts Strafford off for ever, and resumes His ancient path: no Parliament for us, No Strafford for the King! Come, all of you, To bid the King farewell, predict success To his Scots' expedition, and receive Strafford, our comrade now. The next will be Indeed a Parliament! Vane. Forgive me, Pym! Voices. This looks like truth: Strafford can have, indeed No choice. Pym. Friends, follow me! He's with the King. Come, Hampden, and come, Rudyard, and come, Vane This is no sullen day for England, sirs! Strafford shall tell you! Voices. To Whitehall then! Come! Scene II. âWhitehall. Charles and Strafford. Charles. Strafford! Strafford. Is it a dream? my papers, hereâ Thus, as I left them, all the plans you found So happyâ(look! the track you pressed my hand For pointing out)âand in this very room, Over these very plans, you tell me, sir, With the same face, tooâtell me just one thing That ruins them! How's this? What may this mean? Sir, who has done this? Charles. Strafford, who but I? You bade me put the rest away: indeed You are alone. Strafford. Alone, and like to be! No fear, when some unworthy scheme grows ripe, Of those, who hatched it, leaving me to loose The mischief on the world! Laud hatches war, Falls to his prayers, and leaves the rest to me, And I'm alone. Charles. At least, you knew as much When first you undertook the war. Strafford. My liege, Was this the way? I said, since Laud would lap A little blood, 't were best to hurry over The loathsome business, not to be whole months At slaughterâone blow, only one, then, peace, Save for the dreams. I said, to please you both I'd lead an Irish army to the West, While in the South an English . . . but you look As though you had not told me fifty times 'T was a brave plan! My army is all raised, I am prepared to join it . . . Charles. Hear me, Strafford! Strafford. . . . When, for some little thing, my whole design Is set asideâ(where is the wretched paper?) I am to leadâ(ay, here it is)âto lead The English army: why? Northumberland That I appointed, chooses to be sickâ Is frightened: and, meanwhile, who answers for The Irish Parliament? or army, either? Is this my plan? Charles. So disrespectful, sir? Strafford. My liege, do not believe it! I am yours, Yours ever: 't is too late to think about: To the death, yours. Elsewhere, this untoward step Shall pass for mine; the world shall think it mine. But here! But here! I am so seldom here, Seldom with you, my King! I, soon to rush Alone upon a giant in the dark! Charles. My Strafford! Strafford [examines papers awhile]. âSeize the passes of the Tyne!â But, sir, you seeâsee all I say is true? My plan was sure to prosper, so, no cause To ask the Parliament for help; whereas We need them frightfully. Charles. Need the Parliament? Strafford. Now, for God's sake, sir, not one error more! We can afford no error; we draw, now, Upon our last resource: the Parliament Must help us! Charles. I've undone you, Strafford! Strafford. Nayâ Nayâwhy despond, sir, 't is not come to that! I have not hurt you? Sir, what have I said To hurt you? I unsay it! Don't despond! Sir, do you turn from me? Charles. My friend of friends! Strafford. We'll make a shift. Leave me the Parliament! Help they us ne'er so little and I'll make Sufficient out of it. We'll speak them fair. They're sitting, that's one great thing; that half gives Their sanction to us; that's much: don't despond! Why, let them keep their money, at the worst! The reputation of the People's help Is all we want: we'll make shift yet! Charles. Good Strafford! Strafford. But meantime, let the sum be ne'er so small They offer, we'll accept it: any sumâ For the look of it: the least grant tells the Scots The Parliament is oursâtheir staunch ally Turned ours: that told, there's half the blow to strike! What will the grant be? What does Glanville think? Charles. Alas! Strafford. My liege? Charles. Strafford! Strafford. But answer me! Have they . . . O surely not refused us half? Half the twelve subsidies? We never looked For all of them. How many do they give? Charles. You have not heard . . . Strafford. (What has he done?)âHeard what? But speak at once, sir, this grows terrible! [The King continuing silent. You have dissolved them!âI'll not leave this man. Charles. 'T was old Vane's ill-judged vehemence. Strafford. Old Vane? Charles. He told them, just about to vote the half, That nothing short of all twelve subsidies Would serve our turn, or be accepted Strafford. Vane! Vane! Who, sir, promised me, that very Vane . . . O God, to have it gone, quite gone from me, The one last hopeâI that despair, my hopeâ That I should reach his heart one day, and cure All bitterness one day, be proud again And young again, care for the sunshine too, And never think of Eliot any more,â God, and to toil for this, go far for this, Get nearer, and still nearer, reach this heart And find Vane there! [Suddenly taking up a paper, and continuing with a forced calmness. Northumberland is sick: Well, then, I take the army: Wilmot leads The horse, and he, with Conway, must secure The passes of the Tyne: Ormond supplies My place in Ireland. Here, we'll try the City: If they refuse a loanâdebase the coin And seize the bullion! we've no other choice. Herbert . . . And this while I am here! with you! And there are hosts such, hosts like Vane! I go, And, I once gone, they'll close around you, sir, When the least pique, pettiest mistrust, is sure To ruin meâand you along with me! Do you see that? And you along with me! âSir, you'll not ever listen to these men, And I away, fighting your battle? Sir, If theyâif Sheâcharge me, no matter howâ Say you, âAt any time when he returns âHis head is mine!â Don't stop me there! You know My head is yours, but never stop me there! Charles. Too shameful, Strafford! You advised the war, And . . . Strafford. I! I! that was never spoken with Till it was entered on! That loathe the war! That say it is the maddest, wickedest . . . Do you know, sir, I think within my heart, That you would say I did advise the war; And if, through your own weakness, or what's worse, These Scots, with God to help them, drive me back, You will not step between the raging People And me, to say . . . I knew it! from the first I knew it! Never was so cold a heart! Remember that I said itâthat I never Believed you for a moment! âAnd, you loved me? You thought your perfidy profoundly hid Because I could not share the whisperings With Vane, with Savile? What, the face was masked? I had the heart to see, sir! Face of flesh, But heart of stoneâof smooth cold frightful stone! Ay, call them! Shall I call for you? The Scots Goaded to madness? Or the EnglishâPymâ Shall I call Pym, your subject? Oh, you think I'll leave them in the dark about it all? They shall not know you? Hampden, Pym shall not? Pym, Hampden, Vane, etc., enter. [Dropping on his knee.] Thus favoured with your gracious countenance What shall a rebel League avail against Your servant, utterly and ever yours? So, gentlemen, the King's not even left The privilege of bidding me farewell Who haste to save the Peopleâthat you style Your Peopleâfrom the mercies of the Scots And France their friend? [To Charles.] Pym's grave grey eyes are fixed Upon you, sir! Your pleasure, gentlemen? Hampden. The King dissolved usâ't is the King we seek And not Lord Strafford. Strafford. âStrafford, guilty too Of counselling the measure. [To Charles.] (Hush . . . you knowâ You have forgottenâsir, I counselled it) A heinous matter, truly! But the King Will yet see cause to thank me for a course Which now, perchance . . . (Sir, tell them so!)âhe blames. Well, choose some fitter time to make your charge: I shall be with the Scots, you understand? Then yelp at me! Meanwhile, your Majesty Binds me, by this fresh token of your trust . . . [Under the pretence of an earnest farewell, Strafford conducts Charles to the door, in such a manner as to hide his agitation from the rest: as the King disappears, they turn as by one impulse to Pym, who has not changed his original posture of surprise. Hampden. Leave we this arrogant strong wicked man! Vane and others. Hence, Pym! Come out of this unworthy place To our old room again! He's gone. [Strafford, just about to follow the King, looks back. Pym. Not gone! [To Strafford.] Keep tryst! the old appointment's made anew: Forget not we shall meet again! Strafford. So be it! And if an army follows me? Vane. His friends Will entertain your army! Pym. I'll not say You have misreckoned, Strafford: time shows. Perish Body and spirit! Fool to feign a doubt, Pretend the scrupulous and nice reserve Of one whose prowess shall achieve the feat! What share have I in it? Do I affect To see no dismal sign above your head When God suspends his ruinous thunder there? Strafford is doomed. Touch him no one of you! [Pym, Hampden, etc., go out. Strafford. Pym, we shall meet again! Lady Carlisle enters. You here, child? Lady Carlisle. Hushâ I know it all: hush, Strafford! Strafford. Ah? you know? Well. I shall make a sorry soldier, Lucy! All knights begin their enterprise, we read, Under the best of auspices; 't is morn, The Lady girds his sword upon the Youth (He's always very young)âthe trumpets sound, Cups pledge him, and, why, the King blesses himâ You need not turn a page of the romance To learn the Dreadful Giant's fate. Indeed. We've the fair Lady here; but she apart,â A poor man, rarely having handled lance, And rather old, weary, and far from sure His Squires are not the Giant's friends. All's one: Let us go forth! Lady Carlisle. Go forth? Strafford. What matters it? We shall die gloriouslyâas the book says. Lady Carlisle. To Scotland? Not to Scotland? Strafford. Am I sick Like your good brother, brave Northumberland? Beside, these walls seem falling on me. Lady Carlisle. Strafford, The wind that saps these walls can undermine Your camp in Scotland, too. Whence creeps the wind? Have you no eyes except for Pym? Look here! A breed of silken creatures lurk and thrive In your contempt. You'll vanquish Pym? Old Vane Can vanquish you. And Vane you think to fly? Rush on the Scots! Do nobly! Vane's slight sneer Shall test success, adjust the praise, suggest The faint result: Vane's sneer shall reach you there. âYou do not listen! Strafford. Oh,âI give that up! There's fate in it: I give all here quite up. Care not what old Vane does or Holland does Against me! 'T is so idle to withstand! In no case tell me what they do! Lady Carlisle. But, Strafford . . . Strafford. I want a little strife, beside; real strife; This petty palace-warfare does me harm: I shall feel better, fairly out of it. Lady Carlisle. Why do you smile? Strafford. I got to fear them, child! I could have torn his throat at first, old Vane's, As he leered at me on his stealthy way To the Queen's closet. Lord, one loses heart! I often found it in my heart to say âDo not traduce me to her!â Lady Carlisle. But the King . . . Strafford. The King stood there, 't is not so long ago, âThere; and the whisper, Lucy, âBe my friend âOf friends!ââMy King! I would have . . . Lady Carlisle. . . . Died for him? Strafford. Sworn him true, Lucy: I can die for him. Lady Carlisle. But go not, Strafford! But you must renounce This project on the Scots! Die, wherefore die? Charles never loved you. Strafford. And he never will. He's not of those who care the more for men That they're unfortunate. Lady Carlisle. Then wherefore die For such a master? Strafford. You that told me first How good he wasâwhen I must leave true friends To find a truer friend!âthat drew me here From Ireland,ââI had but to show myself âAnd Charles would spurn Vane, Savile and the restââ You, child, to ask me this? Lady Carlisle. (If he have set His heart abidingly on Charles!) Then, friend, I shall not see you any more. Strafford. Yes, Lucy. There's one man here I have to meet. Lady Carlisle. (The King! What way to save him from the King? My soulâ That lent from its own store the charmed disguise Which clothes the Kingâhe shall behold my soul!) Strafford,âI shall speak best if you'll not gaze Upon me: I had never thought, indeed, To speak, but you would perish too, so sure! Could you but know what't is to bear, my friend, One image stamped within you, turning blank The else imperial brilliance of your mind,â A weakness, but most precious,âlike a flaw I' the diamond, which should shape forth some sweet face Yet to create, and meanwhile treasured there Lest nature lose her gracious thought for ever! Strafford. When could it be? no! Yet . . . was it the day We waited in the anteroom, till Holland Should leave the presence-chamber? Lady Carlisle. What? Strafford. âThat I Described to you my love for Charles? Lady Carlisle. (Ah, noâ One must not lure him from a love like that! Oh, let him love the King and die! 'T is past. I shall not serve him worse for that one brief And passionate hope, silent for ever now!) And you are really bound for Scotland then? I wish you well: you must be very sure Of the King's faith, for Pym and all his crew Will not be idleâsetting Vane aside! Strafford. If Pym is busy,âyou may write of Pym. Lady Carlisle. What need, since there's your King to take your part? He may endure Vane's counsel; but for Pymâ Think you he'll suffer Pym to . . . Strafford. Child, your hair Is glossier than the Queen's! Lady Carlisle. Is that to ask A curl of me? Strafford. Scotlandâthe weary way! Lady Carlisle. Stay, let me fasten it. âA rival's, Strafford? Strafford [showing the George]. He hung it there: twine yours around it, child! Lady Carlisle. Noânoâanother timeâI trifle so! And there's a masque on foot. Farewell. The Court Is dull; do something to enliven us In Scotland: we expect it at your hands. Strafford. I shall not fail in Scotland. Lady Carlisle. Prosperâif You'll think of me sometimes! Strafford. How think of him And not of you? of you, the lingering streak (A golden one) in my good fortune's eve. Lady Carlisle. Strafford . . . Well, when the eve has its last streak The night has its first star. [She goes out. Strafford. That voice of hersâ You'd think she had a heart sometimes! His voice Is soft too. Only God can save him now. Be Thou about his bed, about his path! His path! Where's England's path? Diverging wide, And not to join again the track my foot Must followâwhither? All that forlorn way Among the tombs! Farâfarâtill . . . What, they do Then join again, these paths? For, huge in the dusk, There'sâPym to face! Why then, I have a foe To close with, and a fight to fight at last Worthy my soul! What, do they beard the King, And shall the King want Strafford at his need? Am I not here? Not in the market-place, Pressed on by the rough artisans, so proud To catch a glance from Wentworth! They lie down Hungry yet smile âWhy, it must end some day: âIs he not watching for our sake?â Not there! But in Whitehall, the whited sepulchre, The . . . Curse nothing to-night! Only one name They'll curse in all those streets to-night. Whose fault? Did I make kings? set up, the first, a man To represent the multitude, receive All love in right of themâsupplant them so, Until you love the man and not the kingâ The man with the mild voice and mournful eyes Which send me forth. âTo breast the bloody sea That sweeps before me: with one star for guide. Night has its first, supreme, forsaken star.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âOpposite Westminster Hall. Sir Henry Vane, Lord Savile, Lord Holland and others of the Court. Sir H. Vane. The Commons thrust you out? Savile. And what kept you From sharing their civility? Sir H. Vane. Kept me? Fresh news from Scotland, sir! worse than the last, If that may be. All's up with Strafford there: Nothing to bar the mad Scots marching hither Next Lord's-day morning. That detained me, sir! Well now, before they thrust you out,âgo on,â Their Speakerâdid the fellow Lenthal say All we set down for him? Holland. Not a word missed. Ere he began, we entered, Savile, I And Bristol and some more, with hope to breed A wholesome awe in the new Parliament. But such a gang of graceless ruffians, Vane, As glared at us! Vane. So many? Savile. Not a bench Without its complement of burly knaves; Your hopeful son among them: Hampden leant Upon his shoulderâthink of that! Vane. I'd think On Lenthal's speech, if I could get at it. Urged he, I ask, how grateful they should prove For this unlooked-for summons from the King? Holland. Just as we drilled him. Vane. That the Scots will march On London? Holland. All, and made so much of it, A dozen subsidies at least seemed sure To follow, when . . . Vane. Well? Holland. 'T is a strange thing, now! I've a vague memory of a sort of sound, A voice, a kind of vast unnatural voiceâ Pym, sir, was speaking! Savile, help me out: What was it all? Savile. Something about âa matterââ No,ââwork for England.â Holland. âEngland's great revengeâ He talked of. Savile. How should I get used to Pym More than yourselves? Holland. However that be, 'T was something with which we had nought to do, For we were âstrangersâ and't was âEngland's workââ (All this while looking us straight in the face) In other words, our presence might be spared. So, in the twinkling of an eye, before I settled to my mind what ugly brute Was likest Pym just then, they yelled us out, Locked the doors after us, and here are we. Vane. Eliot's old method . . . Savile. Prithee, Vane, a truce To Eliot and his times, and the great Duke, And how to manage Parliaments! 'T was you Advised the Queen to summon this: why, Strafford (To do him justice) would not hear of it. Vane. Say rather, you have done the best of turns To Strafford: he's at York, we all know why. I would you had not set the Scots on Strafford Till Strafford put down Pym for us, my lord! Savile. Was it I altered Strafford's plans? did I . . . A Messenger enters. Messenger. The Queen, my lordsâshe sends me: follow me At once; 't is very urgent! she requires Your counsel: something perilous and strange Occasions her command. Savile. We follow, friend! Now, Vane;âyour Parliament will plague us all! Vane. No Strafford here beside! Savile. If you dare hint I had a hand in his betrayal, sir . . . Holland. Nay, find a fitter time for quarrelsâPym Will overmatch the best of you; and, think, The Queen! Vane. Come on, then: understand, I loathe Strafford as much as anyâbut his use! To keep off Pym, to screen a friend or two, I would we had reserved him yet awhile. Scene II. âWhitehall. The Queen and Lady Carlisle. Queen. It cannot be. Lady Carlisle. It is so. Queen. Why, the House Have hardly met. Lady Carlisle. They met for that. Queen. No, no! Meet to impeach Lord Strafford? 'T is a jest. Lady Carlisle. A bitter one. Queen. Consider! 'T is the House We summoned so reluctantly, which nothing But the disastrous issue of the war Persuaded us to summon. They'll wreak all Their spite on us, no doubt; but the old way Is to begin by talk of grievances: They have their grievances to busy them. Lady Carlisle. Pym has begun his speech. Queen. Where's Vane?âThat is, Pym will impeach Lord Strafford if he leaves His Presidency; he's at York, we know, Since the Scots beat him: why should he leave York? Lady Carlisle. Because the King sent for him. Queen. Ahâbut if The King did send for him, he let him know We had been forced to call a Parliamentâ A step which Strafford, now I come to think, Was vehement against. Lady Carlisle. The policy Escaped him, of first striking Parliaments To earth, then setting them upon their feet And giving them a sword: but this is idle. Did the King send for Strafford? He will come. Queen. And what am I to do? Lady Carlisle. What do? Fail, madam! Be ruined for his sake! what matters how, So it but stand on record that you made An effort, only one? Queen. The King away At Theobald's! Lady Carlisle. Send for him at once: he must Dissolve the House. Queen. Wait till Vane finds the truth Of the report: then . . . Lady Carlisle. âIt will matter little What the King does. Strafford that lends his arm And breaks his heart for you! Sir H. Vane enters. Vane. The Commons, madam, Are sitting with closed doors. A huge debate, No lack of noise; but nothing, I should guess, Concerning Strafford: Pym has certainly Not spoken yet. Queen [to Lady Carlisle]. You hear? Lady Carlisle. I do not hear That the King's sent for! Vane. Savile will be able To tell you more. Holland enters. Queen. The last news, Holland? Holland. Pym Is raging like a fire. The whole House means To follow him together to Whitehall And force the King to give up Strafford. Queen. Strafford? Holland. If they content themselves with Strafford! Laud Is talked of, Cottington and Windebank too. Pym has not left out one of themâI would You heard Pym raging! Queen. Vane, go find the King! Tell the King, Vane, the People follow Pym To brave us at Whitehall! Savile enters. Savile. Not to Whitehallâ 'T is to the Lords they go: they seek redress On Strafford from his peersâthe legal way, They call it. Queen. (Wait, Vane!) Savile. But the adage gives Long life to threatened men. Strafford can save Himself so readily: at York, remember, In his own county: what has he to fear? The Commons only mean to frighten him From leaving York. Surely, he will not come. Queen. Lucy, he will not come! Lady Carlisle. Once more, the King Has sent for Strafford. He will come. Vane. Oh doubtless! And bring destruction with him: that's his way. What but his coming spoilt all Conway's plan? The King must take his counsel, choose his friends, Be wholly ruled by him! What's the result? The North that was to rise, Ireland to help,â What came of it? In my poor mind, a fright Is no prodigious punishment. Lady Carlisle. A fright? Pym will fail worse than Strafford if he thinks To frighten him. [To the Queen.] You will not save him then? Savile. When something like a charge is made, the King Will best know how to save him: and't is clear, While Strafford suffers nothing by the matter, The King may reap advantage: this in question, No dinning you with ship-money complaints! Queen [to Lady Carlisle]. If we dissolve them, who will pay the army? Protect us from the insolent Scots? Lady Carlisle. In truth, I know not, madam. Strafford's fate concerns Me little: you desired to learn what course Would save him: I obey you. Vane. Notice, too, There can't be fairer ground for taking full Revengeâ(Strafford's revengeful)âthan he'll have Against his old friend Pym. Queen. Why, he shall claim Vengeance on Pym! Vane. And Strafford, who is he To 'scape unscathed amid the accidents That harass all beside? I, for my part, Should look for something of discomfiture Had the King trusted me so thoroughly And been so paid for it. Holland. He'll keep at York: All will blow over: he'll return no worse, Humbled a little, thankful for a place Under as good a man. Oh, we'll dispense With seeing Strafford for a month or two! Strafford enters. Queen. You here! Strafford. The King sends for me, madam, Queen. Sir, The King . . . Strafford. An urgent matter that imports the King! [To Lady Carlisle.] Why, Lucy, what's in agitation now, That all this muttering and shrugging, see, Begins at me? They do not speak! Lady Carlisle. 'T is welcome! For we are proud of youâhappy and proud To have you with us, Strafford! You were staunch At Durham: you did well there! Had you not Been stayed, you might have . . . . we said, even now, Our hope's in you! Vane [to Lady Carlisle]. The Queen would speak with you. Strafford. Will one of you, his servants here, vouchsafe To signify my presence to the King? Savile. An urgent matter? Strafford. None that touches you, Lord Savile! Say, it were some treacherous Sly pitiful intriguing with the Scotsâ You would go free, at least! (They half divine My purpose!) Madam, shall I see the King? The service I would render, much concerns His welfare. Queen. But his Majesty, my lord, May not be here, may . . . Strafford. Its importance, then, Must plead excuse for this withdrawal, madam, And for the grief it gives Lord Savile here. Queen [who has been conversing with Vane and Holland]. The King will see you, sir! [To Lady Carlisle.] Mark me: Pym's worst Is done by now: he has impeached the Earl, Or found the Earl too strong for him, by now. Let us not seem instructed! We should work No good to Strafford, but deform ourselves With shame in the world's eye. [To Strafford.] His Majesty Has much to say with you. Strafford. Time fleeting, too! [To Lady Carlisle.] No means of getting them away? And Sheâ What does she whisper? Does she know my purpose? What does she think of it? Get them away! Queen [to Lady Carlisle]. He comes to baffle Pym âhe thinks the danger. Far off: tell him no word of it! a time For help will come; we'll not be wanting then. Keep him in play, Lucyâyou, self-possessed And calm! [To Strafford.] To spare you lordship some delay I will myself acquaint the King. [To Lady Carlisle.] Beware! [The Queen, Vane, Holland, and Savile go out. Strafford, She knows it? Lady Carlisle. Tell me, Strafford! Strafford. Afterward! This moment's the great moment of all time. She knows my purpose? Lady Carlisle Thoroughly: just now She bade me hide it from you. Strafford. Quick, dear child, The whole o' the scheme? Lady Carlisle. (Ah, he would learn if they Connive at Pym's procedure! Could they but Have once apprised the King! But there's no time For falsehood, now.) Strafford, the whole is known. Strafford. Known and approved? Lady Carlisle. Hardly discountenanced. Strafford. And the Kingâsay, the King consents as well? Lady Carlisle. The King's not yet informed, but will not dare To interpose. Strafford. What need to wait him, then? He'll sanction it! I stayed, child, tell him, long! It vexed me to the soulâthis waiting here. You know him, there's no counting on the King. Tell him I waited long! Lady Carlisle (What can he mean? Rejoice at the King's hollowness?) Strafford. I knew They would be glad of it,âall over once, I knew they would be glad: but he'd contrive, The Queen and he, to mar, by helping it, An angel's making. Lady Carlisle. (Is he mad?) Dear Strafford, You were not wont to look so happy. Strafford. Sweet, I tried obedience thoroughly. I took The King's wild plan: of course, ere I could reach My army, Conway ruined it. I drew The wrecks together, raised all heaven and earth, And would have fought the Scots: the King at once Made truce with them. Then, Lucy, then, dear child, God put it in my mind to love, serve, die For Charles, but never to obey him more! While he endured their insolence at Ripon I fell on them at Durham. But you'll tell The King I waited? All the anteroom Is filled with my adherents. Lady Carlisle. StraffordâStrafford, What daring act is this you hint? Strafford. No, no! 'T is here, not daring if you knew? all here! [Drawing papers from his breast. Full proof, see, ample proofâdoes the Queen know I have such damning proof? Bedford and Essex, Brooke, Warwick, Savile (did you notice Savile? The simper that I spoilt?), Saye, Mandevilleâ Sold to the Scots, body and soul, by Pym! Lady Carlisle. Great heaven! Strafford. From Savile and his lords, to Pym And his losels, crushed!âPym shall not ward the blow Nor Savile creep aside from it! The Crew And the CabalâI crush them! Lady Carlisle. And you goâ Strafford,âand now you go?â Strafford. âAbout no work In the background, I promise you! I go Straight to the House of Lords to claim these knaves. Mainwaring! Lady Carlisle. Stayâstay, Strafford! Strafford. She'll return, The Queenâsome little project of her own! No time to lose: the King takes fright perhaps. Lady Carlisle. Pym's strong, remember! Strafford. Very strong, as fits The Faction's headâwith no offence to Hampden, Vane, Rudyard and my loving Hollis: one And all they lodge within the Tower to-night In just equality. Brian! Mainwaring! [Many of his Adherents enter. The Peers debate just now (a lucky chance) On the Scots' war; my visit's opportune. When all is over, Bryan, you proceed To Ireland: these dispatches, mark me, Bryan, Are for the Deputy, and these for Ormond: We want the army hereâmy army, raised At such a cost, that should have done such good, And was inactive all the time! no matter, We'll find a use for it. Willis . . . or, noâyou! You, friend, make haste to York: bear this, at once . . . Or,âbetter stay for form's sake, see yourself The news you carry. You remain with me To execute the Parliament's command, Mainwaring! Help to seize these lesser knaves, Take care there's no escaping at backdoors: I'll not have one escape, mind meânot one! I seem revengeful, Lucy? Did you know What these men dare! Lady Carlisle. It is so much they dare! Strafford. I proved that long ago; my turn is now. Keep sharp watch, Goring, on the citizens! Observe who harbours any of the brood That scramble off: be sure they smart for it! Our coffers are but lean. And you, child, too, Shall have your task; deliver this to Laud. Laud will not be the slowest in my praise: âThoroughâ he'll cry!âFoolish, to be so glad! This life is gay and glowing, after all: 'T is worth while, Lucy, having foes like mine Just for the bliss of crushing them. To-day Is worth the living for. Lady Carlisle. That reddening brow! You seem . . . Strafford. Wellâdo I not? I would be wellâ I could not but be well on such a day! And, this day ended, 't is of slight import How long the ravaged frame subjects the soul In Strafford. Lady Carlisle. Noble Strafford! Strafford. No farewell! I'll see you anon, to-morrowâthe first thing. âIf She should come to stay me! Lady Carlisle. Goâ't is nothingâ Only my heart that swells: it has been thus Ere now: go, Strafford! Strafford. To-night, then, let it be. I must see Him: you, the next after Him. I'll tell you how Pym looked. Follow me, friends! You, gentlemen, shall see a sight this hour To talk of all your lives. Close after me! âMy friend of friends!â [Strafford and the rest go out. Lady Carlisle. The Kingâever the King! No thought of one beside, whose little word Unveils the King to himâone word from me, Which yet I do not breathe! Ah, have I spared Strafford a pang, and shall I seek reward Beyond that memory? Surely too, some way He is the better for my love. No, noâ He would not look so joyousâI'll believe His very eye would never sparkle thus, Had I not prayed for him this long, long while. Scene III. âThe Antechamber of the House of Lords. Many of the Presbyterian Party. The Adherents of Strafford, etc. A Group of Presbyterians.-1. I tell you he struck Maxwell: Maxwell sought To stay the Earl: he struck him and passed on. 2. Fear as you may, keep a good countenance Before these rufflers. 3.

A Presbyterian. No, nor in Ireland; we have leave to breathe. One of Strafford's Followers. Truly? Behold how privileged we be That serve âKing Pymâ! There's Some-one at Whitehall Who skulks obscure; but Pym struts . . . The Presbyterian. Nearer. A Follower of Strafford. Higher, We look to see him. [To his Companions.] I'm to have St. John In charge; was he among the knaves just now That followed Pym within there? Another. The gaunt man Talking with Rudyard. Did the Earl expect Pym at his heels so fast? I like it not. Maxwell enters. Another. Why, man, they rush into the net! Here's Maxwellâ Ha, Maxwell? How the brethren flock around The fellow! Do you feel the Earl's hand yet Upon your shoulder, Maxwell? Maxwell. Gentlemen, Stand back! a great thing passes here. A Follower of Strafford. [To another.] The Earl Is at his work! [To M.] Say, Maxwell, what great thing! Speak out! [To a Presbyterian.] Friend, I've a kindness for you! Friend, I've seen you with St. John: O stockishness! Wear such a ruff, and never call to mind St. John's head in a charger? How, the plague, Not laugh? Another. Say, Maxwell, what great thing! Another. Nay, wait: The jest will be to wait. First. And who's to bear These demure hypocrites? You'd swear they came . . . Came . . . just as we come! [A Puritan enters hastily and without observing Strafford's Followers. The Puritan. How goes on the work? Has Pym . . . A Follower of Strafford. The secret's out at last. Aha, The carrion's scented! Welcome, crow the first! Gorge merrily, you with the blinking eye! âKing Pym has fallen!â The Puritan. Pym? A Strafford. Pym! A Presbyterian. Only Pym? Many of Strafford's Followers. No, brother, not Pym only; Vane as well, Rudyard as well, Hampden, St. John as well! A Presbyterian. My mind misgives: can it be true? Another. Lost! Lost! A Strafford. Say we true, Maxwell? The Puritan. Pride before destruction, A haughty spirit goeth before a fall. Many of Strafford's Followers. Ah now! The very thing! A word in season! A golden apple in a silver picture, To greet Pym as he passes! [The doors at the back begin to open, noise and light issuing Maxwell. Stand back, all! Many of the Presbyterians. I hold with Pym! And I! Strafford's Followers. Now for the text! He comes! Quick! The Puritan. How hath the oppressor ceased! The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked! The sceptre of the rulers, he who smote The people in wrath with a continual stroke, That ruled the nations in his angerâhe Is persecuted and none hindereth! [The doors open, and Strafford issues in the greatest disorder, and amid cries from within of âVoid the House!â Strafford. Impeach me! Pym! I never struck, I think, The felon on that calm insulting mouth When it proclaimedâPym's mouth proclaimed me . . . God! Was it a word, only a word that held The outrageous blood back on my heartâwhich beats! Which beats! Some one wordââTraitor,â did he say, Bending that eye, brimful of bitter fire, Upon me? Maxwell. In the Commons' name, their servant Demands Lord Strafford's sword. Strafford. What did you say? Maxwell. The Commons bid me ask your lordship's sword. Strafford. Let us go forth: follow me, gentlemen! Draw your swords too: cut any down that bar us. On the King's service! Maxwell, clear the way! [The Presbyterians prepare to dispute his passage. Strafford. I stay: the King himself shall see me here. Your tablets, fellow! [To Mainwaring.] Give that to the King! Yes, Maxwell, for the next half-hour, let be! Nay, you shall take my sword! [Maxwell advances to take it. Or, noânot that! Their blood, perhaps, may wipe out all thus far, All up to thatânot that! Why, friend, you see When the King lays your head beneath my foot It will not pay for that. Go, all of you! Maxwell. I dare, my lord, to disobey: none stir! Strafford. This gentle Maxwell!âDo not touch him, Bryan! [To the Presbyterians.] Whichever cur of you will carry this Escapes his fellow's fate. None saves his life? None? [Cries from within of âStrafford!â Slingsby, I've loved you at least: make haste! Stab me! I have not time to tell you why. You then, my Bryan! Mainwaring, you then! Is it because I spoke so hastily At Allerton? The King had vexed me. [To the Presbyterians.] You! âNot even you? If I live over this, The King is sure to have your heads, you know! But what if I can't live this minute through? Pym, who is there with his pursuing smile! [Louder cries of âStrafford!â The King! I troubled him, stood in the way Of his negotiations, was the one Great obstacle to peace, the Enemy Of Scotland: and he sent for me, from York, My safety guaranteedâhaving prepared A ParliamentâI see! And at Whitehall The Queen was whispering with VaneâI see The trap! [Tearing off the George. I tread a gewgaw underfoot, And cast a memory from me. One stroke, now! [His own Adherents disarm him. Renewed cries of âStrafford!â England! I see thy arm in this and yield. Pray you nowâPym awaits meâpray you now! [Strafford reaches the doors: they open wide.

One word! Charles. [To Hollis.] You stand, silent and cold, as though I were Deceiving youâmy friend, my playfellow Of other times. What wonder after all? Just so, I dreamed my People loved me. Hollis. Sir, It is yourself that you deceive, not me. You'll quit me comforted, your mind made up That, since you've talked thus much and grieved thus much, All you can do for Strafford has been done. Queen. If you kill Straffordâ(come, we grant you leave, Suppose)â Hollis. I may withdraw, sir? Lady Carlisle. Hear them out! T is the last chance for Strafford! Hear them out!

You witness our proceedings every day; But the screened gallery, I might have guessed, Admits of such a partial glimpse at us, Pym takes up all the room, shuts out the view. Still, on my honour, sir, the rest of the place Is not unoccupied. The Commons sit âThat's England; Ireland sends, and Scotland too, Their representatives; the Peers that judge Are easily distinguished; one remarks The People here and there: but the close curtain Must hide so much! Queen. Acquaint your insolent crew, This day the curtain shall be dashed aside! It served a purpose. Hollis. Think! This very day? Ere Strafford rises to defend himself? Charles. I will defend him, sir!âsanction the past This day: it ever was my purpose. Rage At me, not Strafford! Lady Carlisle. Nobly!âwill he not Do nobly? Hollis. Sir, you will do honestly; And, for that deed, I too would be a king. Charles. Only, to do this now!ââdeafâ (in your style) âTo subjects' prayers,ââI must oppose them now! It seems their will the trial should proceed,â So palpably their will! Hollis. You peril much, But it were no bright moment save for that. Strafford, your prime support, the sole roof-tree Which props this quaking House of Privilege, (Floods come, winds beat, and seeâthe treacherous sand!) Doubtless, if the mere putting forth an arm Could save him, you'd save Strafford. Charles. And they mean Consummate calmly this great wrong! No hope? This ineffaceable wrong! No pity then? Hollis. No plague in store for perfidy?âFarewell! You called me, sirâ[To Lady Carlisle.] you, lady, bade me come To save the Earl: I came, thank God for it, To learn how far such perfidy can go! You, sir, concert with me on saving him Who have just ruined Strafford! Charles. I?âand how? Hollis. Eighteen days long be throws one after one, Pym's charges back: a blind moth-eaten law! âHe'll break from it at last: and whom to thank? The mouse that gnawed the lion's net for him Got a good friend,âbut he, the other mouse, That looked on while the lion freed himselfâ Fared he so well, does any fable say? Charles. What can you mean? Hollis. Pym never could have proved Strafford's design of bringing up the troops To force this kingdom to obedience: Vaneâ Your servant, not our friend, has proved it. Charles. Vane? Hollis. This day. Did Vane deliver up or no Those notes which, furnished by his son to Pym, Seal Strafford's fate? Charles. Sir, as I live, I know Nothing that Vane has done! What treason next? I wash my hands of it. Vane, speak the truth! Ask Vane himself! Hollis. I will not speak to Vane, Who speak to Pym and Hampden every day. Queen. Speak to Vane's master then! What gain to him Were Strafford's death? Hollis. Ha? Strafford cannot turn As you, sir, sit thereâbid you forth, demand If every hateful act were not set down In his commission?âwhether you contrived Or no, that all the violence should seem His work, the gentle waysâyour own,âhis part, To counteract the King's kind impulsesâ While . . . but you know what he could say! And then He might produce,âmark, sir!âa certain charge To set the King's express command aside, If need were, and be blameless. He might add . . . Charles. Enough! Hollis. âWho bade him break the Parliament, Find some pretence for setting up sword-law! Queen. Retire! Charles. Once more, whatever Vane dared do, I know not: he is rash, a foolâI know Nothing of Vane! Hollis. WellâI believe you. Sir, Believe me, in return, that . . . [Turning to Lady Carlisle.] Gentle lady, The few words I would say, the stones might hear Sooner than these,âI rather speak to you, You, with the heart! The question, trust me, takes Another shape, to-day: not, if the King Or England shall succumb,âbut, who shall pay The forfeit, Strafford or his master. Sir, You loved me once: think on my warning now! [Goes out. Charles. On you and on your warning both!âCarlisle! That paper! Queen. But consider! Charles. Give it me! There, signedâwill that content you? Do not speak! You have betrayed me, Vane! See! any day, According to the tenor of that paper, He bids your brother bring the army up, Strafford shall head it and take full revenge. Seek Strafford! Let him have the same, before He rises to defend himself! Queen. In truth? That your shrewd Hollis should have worked a change Like this! You, late reluctant . . . Charles. Say, Carlisle, Your brother Percy brings the army up, Falls on the Parliamentâ(I'll think of you, My Hollis!) say, we plotted longâ't is mine, The scheme is mine, remember! Say, I cursed Vane's folly in your hearing! If the Earl Does rise to do us shame, the fault shall lie With you, Carlisle! Lady Carlisle. Nay, fear not me! but still That's a bright moment, sir, you throw away. Tear down the veil and save him! Queen. Go, Carlisle! Lady Carlisle. (I shall see Straffordâspeak to him: my heart Must never beat so, then! And if I tell The truth? What's gained by falsehood? There they stand Whose trade it is, whose life it is! How vain To gild such rottenness! Strafford shall know, Thoroughly know them!) Queen. Trust to me! [To Carlisle.] Carlisle, You seem inclined, alone of all the Court, To serve poor Strafford: this bold plan of yours Merits much praise, and yet . . . Lady Carlisle. Time presses, madam. Queen. Yetâmay it not be something premature? Strafford defends himself to-dayâreserves Some wondrous effort, one may well suppose! Lady Carlisle. Ay, Hollis hints as much. Charles. Why linger then? Haste with the schemeâmy scheme: I shall be there To watch his look. Tell him I watch his look! Queen. Stay, we'll precede you! Lady Carlisle. At your pleasure. Charles. Sayâ Say, Vane is hardly ever at Whitehall! I shall be there, remember! Lady Carlisle. Doubt me not. Charles. On our return, Carlisle, we wait you here! Lady Carlisle. I'll bring his answer. Sir, I follow you. (Prove the King faithless, and I take away All Strafford cares to live for: let it beâ 'T is the King's scheme! My Strafford, I can save, Nay, I have saved you, yet am scarce content, Because my poor name will not cross your mind. Strafford, how much I am unworthy you!) Scene II. âA Passage adjoining Westminster Hall. Many Groups of Spectators of the Trial. Officers of the Court, etc. 1st Spectator. More crowd than ever! Not know Hampden, man? That's he, by Pym, Pym that is speaking now. No, truly, if you look so high you'll see Little enough of either! 2nd Spectator. Stay: Pym's arm Points like a prophet's rod. 3rd Spectator. Ay, ay, we've heard Some pretty speaking: yet the Earl escapes. 4th Spectator. I fear it: just a foolish word or two About his childrenâand we see, forsooth, Not England's foe in Strafford, but the man Who, sick, half-blind . . . 2nd Spectator. What's that Pym's saying now Which makes the curtains flutter? look! A hand Clutches them. Ah! The King's hand! 5th Spectator. I had thought Pym was not near so tall. What said he, friend? 2nd Spectator. âNor is this way a novel way of blood,â And the Earl turns as it to . . . look! look! Many Spectators. There! What ails him? noâhe rallies, seeâgoes on, And Strafford smiles. Strange! An Officer. Haselrig! Many Spectators. Friend? Friend? The Officer. Lost, utterly lost: just when we looked for Pym To make a stand against the ill effects Of the Earl's speech! Is Haselrig without? Pym's message is to him. 3rd Spectator. Now, said I true? Will the Earl leave them yet at fault or no? 1st Spectator. Never believe it, man! These notes of Vane's Ruin the Earl. 5th Spectator. A brave end: not a whit Less firm, less Pym all over. Then, the trial Is closed. NoâStrafford means to speak again? An Officer. Stand back, there! 5th Spectator. Why, the Earl is coming hither! Before the court breaks up! His brother, look,â You'd say he'd deprecated some fierce act In Strafford's mind just now. An Officer. Stand back, I say! 2nd Spectator. Who's the veiled woman that he talks with? Many Spectators. Hushâ The Earl! the Earl! [Enter Strafford, Slingsby, and other Secretaries, Hollis, Lady Carlisle, Maxwell, Balfour, etc. Strafford converses with Lady Carlisle. Hollis. So near the end! Be patientâ Return! Strafford [to his Secretaries]. Hereâanywhereâor, 't is freshest here! To spend one's April here, the blossom-month: Set it down here! [They arrange a table, papers, etc. So, Pym can quail, can cower Because I glance at him, yet more's to do? What's to be answered, Slingsby? Let us end! [To Lady Carlisle.] Child, I refuse his offer; whatsoe'er It be! Too late! Tell me no word of him! 'T is something, Hollis, I assure you thatâ To stand, sick as you are, some eighteen days Fighting for life and fame against a pack Of very curs, that lie through thick and thin, Eat flesh and bread by wholesale, and can't say âStraffordâ if it would take my life! Lady Carlisle. Be moved! Glance at the paper! Strafford. Already at my heels! Pym's faulting bloodhounds scent the track again. Peace, child! Now, Slingsby [Messengers from Lane and other of Strafford's Counsel within the Hall are coming and going during the Scene. Strafford [setting himself to write and dictate]. I shall beat you, Hollis! Do you know that? In spite of St. John's tricks, In spite of Pymâyour Pym who shrank from me! Eliot would have contrived it otherwise. [To a Messenger.] In truth? This slip, tell Lane, contains as much As I can call to mind about the matter. Eliot would have disdained . . . [Calling after the Messenger.] And Radcliffe, say, The only person who could answer Pym, Is safe in prison, just for that. Well, well! It had not been recorded in that case, I baffled you. [To Lady Carlisle.] Nay, child, why look so grieved? All's gained without the King! You saw Pym quail? What shall I do when they acquit me, think you, But tranquilly resume my task as though Nothing had intervened since I proposed To call that traitor to account! Such tricks, Trust me, shall not be played a second time, Not even against Laud, with his grey hairâ Your good work, Hollis! Peace! To make amends, You, Lucy, shall be here when I impeach Pym and his fellows. Hollis. Wherefore not protest Against our whole proceeding, long ago? Why feel indignant now? Why stand this while Enduring patiently? Strafford. Child, I'll tell youâ You, and not Pymâyou, the slight graceful girl Tall for a flowering lily, and not Hollisâ Why I stood patient! I was fool enough To see the will of England in Pym's will; To fear, myself had wronged her, and to wait Her judgment: when, behold, in place of it . . . [To a Messenger who whispers.] Tell Lane to answer no such question! Law,â I grapple with their law! I'm here to try My actions by their standard, not my own! Their law allowed that levy: what's the rest To Pym, or Lane, any but God and me? Lady Carlisle. The King's so weak! Secure this chance! 'T was Vane, Never forget, who furnished Pym the notes . . . Strafford. Fit,âvery fit, those precious notes of Vane, To close the Trial worthily! I feared Some spice of nobleness might linger yet And spoil the character of all the past. Vane eased me . . . and I will go back and say As muchâto Pym, to England! Follow me! I have a word to say! There, my defence Is done! Stay! why be proud? Why care to own My gladness, my surprise?âNay, not surprise! Wherefore insist upon the little pride Of doing all myself, and sparing him The pain? Child, say the triumph is my King's! When Pym grew pale, and trembled, and sank down, One image was before me: could I fail? Child, care not for the past, so indistinct, Obscureâthere's nothing to forgive in it 'T is so forgotten! From this day begins A new life, founded on a new belief In Charles. Hollis. In Charles? Rather believe in Pym! And here he comes in proof! Appeal to Pym! Say how unfair . . . Strafford. To Pym? I would say nothing! I would not look upon Pym's face again. Lady Carlisle. Stay, let me have to think I pressed your hand! [Strafford and his friends go out. Enter Hampden and Vane. Vane. O Hampden, save the great misguided man! Plead Strafford's cause with Pym! I have remarked He moved no muscle when we all declaimed Against him: you had but to breatheâhe turned Those kind calm eyes upon you. [Enter Pym, the Solicitor-General St. John, the Managers of the Trial, Fiennes, Rudyard, etc. Rudyard. Horrible! Till now all hearts were with you: I withdraw For one. Too horrible! But we mistake Your purpose, Pym: you cannot snatch away The last spar from the drowning man. Fiennes. He talks With St. John of itâsee, how quietly! [To other Presbyterians.] You'll join us? Strafford may deserve the worst: But this new course is monstrous. Vane, take heart! This Bill of his Attainder shall not have One true man's hand to it. Vane. Consider, Pym! Confront your Bill, your own Bill: what is it? You cannot catch the Earl on any charge,â No man will say the law has hold of him On any charge; and therefore you resolve To take the general sense on his desert, As though no law existed, and we met To found one. You refer to Parliament To speak its thought upon the abortive mass Of half-borne-out assertions, dubious hints Hereafter to be cleared, distortionsâay, And wild inventions. Every man is saved The task of fixing any single charge On Strafford: he has but to see in him The enemy of England. Pym. A right scruple! I have heard some called England's enemy With less consideration. Vane. Pity me! Indeed you made me think I was your friend! I who have murdered Strafford, how remove That memory from me? Pym. I absolve you, Vane. Take you no care for aught that you have done! Vane. John Hampden, not this Bill! Reject this Bill! He staggers through the ordeal: let him go, Strew no fresh fire before him! Plead for us! When Strafford spoke, your eyes were thick with tears! Hampden. England speaks louder: who are we, to play The generous pardoner at her expense, Magnanimously waive advantages, And, if he conquer us, applaud his skill? Vane. He was your friend. Pym. I have heard that before. Fiennes. And England trusts you. Hampden. Shame be his, who turns The opportunity of serving her She trusts him with, to his own mean accountâ Who would look nobly frank at her expense! Fiennes. I never thought it could have come to this. Pym. But I have made myself familiar, Fiennes, With this one thoughtâhave walked, and sat, and slept, This thought before me. I have done such things, Being the chosen man that should destroy The traitor. You have taken up this thought To play with, for a gentle stimulant, To give a dignity to idler life By the dim prospect of emprise to come, But ever with the softening, sure belief, That all would end some strange way right at last. Fiennes. Had we made out some weightier charge! Pym. You say That these are petty charges: can we come To the real charge at all? There he is safe In tyranny's stronghold. Apostasy Is not a crime, treachery not a crime: The cheek burns, the blood tingles, when you speak The words, but where's the power to take revenge Upon them? We must make occasion serve,â The oversight shall pay for the main sin That mocks us. Rudyard. But this unexampled course, This Bill! Pym. By this, we roll the clouds away Of precedent and custom, and at once Bid the great beacon-light God sets in all, The conscience of each bosom, shine upon The guilt of Strafford: each man lay his hand Upon his breast, and judge! Vane. I only see Strafford, nor pass his corpse for all beyond! Rudyard and others. Forgive him! He would join us, now he finds What the King counts reward! The pardon, too, Should be your own. Yourself should bear to Strafford The pardon of the Commons. Pym. Meet him? Strafford? Have we to meet once more, then? Be it so! And yetâthe prophecy seemed half fulfilled When, at the Trial, as he gazed, my youth, Our friendship, divers thoughts came back at once And left me, for a time . . . 'T is very sad! To-morrow we discuss the points of law With Laneâto-morrow? Vane. Not before to-morrowâ So, time enough! I knew you would relent! Pym. The next day, Haselrig, you introduce The Bill of his Attainder. Pray for me! Scene III. âWhitehall. The King. Charles. My loyal servant! To defend himself Thus irresistibly,âwithholding aught That seemed to implicate us! We have done Less gallantly by Strafford. Well, the future Must recompense the past. She tarries long. I understand you, Strafford, now! The schemeâ Carlisle's mad schemeâhe'll sanction it, I fear, For love of me. 'T was too precipitate: Before the army's fairly on its march, He'll be at large: no matter. Well, Carlisle? Enter Pym. Pym. Fear me not, sir:âmy mission is to save, This time. Charles. To break thus on me! Unannounced! Pym. It is of Strafford I would speak. Charles. No more Of Strafford! I have heard too much from you. Pym. I spoke, sir, for the People; will you hear A word upon my own account? Charles. Of Strafford? (So turns the tide already? Have we tamed The insolent brawler?âStrafford's eloquence Is swift in its effect.) Lord Strafford, sir, Has spoken for himself. Pym. Sufficiently. I would apprise you of the novel course The People take: the Trial fails. Charles. Yes, yes We are aware, sir: for your part in it Means shall be found to thank you. Pym. Pray you, read This schedule! I would learn from your own mouth â(It is a matter much concerning me)â Whether, if two Estates of us concede The death of Strafford, on the grounds set forth Within that parchment, you, sir, can resolve To grant your own consent to it. This Bill Is framed by me. If you determine, sir, That England's manifested will should guide Your judgment, ere another week such will Shall manifest itself. If not,âI cast Aside the measure. Charles. You can hinder, then, The introduction of this Bill? Pym. I can. Charles. He is my friend, sir: I have wronged him: mark you, Had I not wronged him, this might be. You think Because you hate the Earl . . . (turn not away, We know you hate him)âno one else could love Strafford: but he has saved me, some affirm. Think of his pride! And do you know one strange, One frightful thing? We all have used the man As though a drudge of ours, with not a source Of happy thoughts except in us; and yet Strafford has wife and children, household cares, Just as if we had never been. Ah sir, You are moved, even you, a solitary man Wed to your causeâto England if you will! Pym. Yesâthink, my soulâto England! Draw not back! Charles. Prevent that Bill, sir! All your course seems fair Till now. Why, in the end, 't is I should sign The warrant for his death! You have said much I ponder on; I never meant, indeed, Strafford should serve me any more. I take The Commons' counsel; but this Bill is yoursâ Nor worthy of its leader: care not, sir, For that, however! I will quite forget You named it to me. You are satisfied? Pym. Listen to me, sir! Eliot laid his hand, Wasted and white upon my forehead once; Wentworthâhe's gone now!âhas talked on, whole nights, And I beside him; Hampden loves me: sir, How can I breathe and not wish England well, And her King well? Charles. I thank you, sir, who leave That King his servant. Thanks, sir! Pym. Let me speak! âWho may not speak again; whose spirit yearns For a cool night after this weary day: âWho would not have my soul turn sicker yet In a new task, more fatal, more august, More full of England's utter weal or woe. I thought, sir, could I find myself with you, After this trial, alone, as man to manâ I might say something, warn you, pray you, saveâ Mark me, King Charles, saveâyou! But God must do it. Yet I warn you, sirâ (With Strafford's faded eyes yet full on me) As you would have no deeper question moved ââHow long the Many must endure the One,â Assure me, sir, if England give assent To Strafford's death, you will not interfere! Orâ Charles. God forsakes me. I am in a net And cannot move. Let all be as you say! Enter Lady Carlisle. Lady Carlisle. He loves youâlooking beautiful with joy Because you sent me! he would spare you all The pain! he never dreamed you would forsake Your servant in the evil dayânay, see Your scheme returned! That generous heart of his! He needs it notâor, needing it, disdains A course that might endanger youâyou, sir, Whom Strafford from his inmost soul . . . [Seeing Pym.] Well met! No fear for Strafford! All that's true and brave On your own side shall help us: we are now Stronger than ever. Haâwhat, sir, is this? All is not well! What parchment have you there? Pym. Sir, much is saved us both. Lady Carlisle. This Bill! Your lip Whitensâyou could not read one line to me Your voice would falter so! Pym. No recreant yet! The great word went from England to my soul, And I arose. The end is very near. Lady Carlisle. I am to save him! All have shrunk beside; 'T is only I am left. Heaven will make strong The hand now as the heart. Then let both die!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âWhitehall. Hollis, Lady Carlisle. Hollis. Tell the King then! Come in with me! Lady Carlisle. Not so! He must not hear till it succeeds. Hollis. Succeed? No dream was half so vainâyou'd rescue Strafford And outwit Pym! I cannot tell you . . . lady, The block pursues me, and the hideous show. To-day . . . is it to-day? And all the while He's sure of the King's pardon. Think, I have To tell this man he is to die. The King May rend his hair, for me! I'll not see Strafford! Lady Carlisle. Only, if I succeed, rememberâCharles Has saved him. He would hardly value life Unless his gift. My staunch friends wait. Go inâ You must go in to Charles! Hollis. And all beside Left Strafford long ago. The King has signed The warrant for his death! the Queen was sick Of the eternal subject. For the Court,â The Trial was amusing in its way, Only too much of it: the Earl withdrew In time. But you, fragile, alone, so young Amid rude mercenariesâyou devise A plan to save him! Even though it fails, What shall reward you? Lady Carlisle. I may go, you think, To France with him? And you reward me, friend, Who lived with Strafford even from his youth Before he set his heart on state-affairs And they bent down that noble brow of his. I have learned somewhat of his latter life, And all the future I shall know: but, Hollis, I ought to make his youth my own as well. Tell me,âwhen he is saved! Hollis. My gentle friend, He should know all and love you, but't is vain! Lady Carlisle. Love? noâtoo late now! Let him love the King! 'T is the King's scheme! I have your word, remember! We'll keep the old delusion up. But, quick! Quick! Each of us has work to do, beside! Go to the King! I hopeâHollisâI hope! Say nothing of my scheme! Hush, while we speak Think where he is! Now for my gallant friends! Hollis. Where he is? Calling wildly upon Charles, Guessing his fate, pacing the prison-floor. Let the King tell him! I'll not look on Strafford. Scene II. âThe Tower. Strafford sitting with his Children. They sing. [Children.] O bell' andare Per barca in mare, Verso la sera Di Primavera! William. The boat's in the broad moonlight all this whileâ Verso la sera Di Primavera! And the boat shoots from underneath the moon Into the shadowy distance; only still You hear the dipping oarâ Verso la sera, And faint, and fainter, and then all's quite gone, Music and light and all, like a lost star. Anne. But you should sleep, father: you were to sleep. Strafford. I do sleep, Anne; or if notâyou must know There's such a thing as . . . William. You're too tired to sleep? Strafford. It will come by-and-by and all day long, In that old quiet house I told you of: We sleep safe there. Anne. Why not in Ireland? Strafford. No! Too many dreams!âThat song's for Venice, William: You know how Venice looks upon the mapâ Isles that the mainland hardly can let go? William. You've been to Venice, father? Strafford. I was young, then William. A city with no King; that's why I like Even a song that comes from Venice. Strafford. William! William. Oh, I know why! Anne, do you love the King? But I'll see Venice for myself one day. Strafford. See many lands, boyâEngland last of all,â That way you'll love her best. William. Why do men say You sought to ruin her then? Strafford. Ah,âthey say that. William. Why? Strafford. I suppose they must have words to say, As you to sing. Anne. But they make songs beside: Last night I heard one, in the street beneath, That called you . . . Oh, the names! William. Don't mind her, father! They soon left off when I cried out to them. Strafford. We shall so soon be out of it, my boy! 'T is not worth while: who heeds a foolish song? William. Why, not the King. Strafford. Well: it has been the fate Of better; and yet,âwherefore not feel sure That time, who in the twilight comes to mend All the fantastic day's caprice, consign To the low ground once more the ignoble Term, And raise the Genius on his orb again,â That time will do me right? Anne. (Shall we sing, William? He does not look thus when we sing.) Strafford. For Ireland, Something is done: too little, but enough To show what might have been. William. (I have no heart To sing now! Anne, how very sad he looks! Oh, I so hate the King for all he says!) Strafford. Forsook them! What, the common songs will run That I forsook the People? Nothing more? Ay, Fame, the busy scribe, will pause, no doubt, Turning a deaf ear to her thousand slaves Noisy to be enrolled,âwill register The curious glosses, subtle notices, Ingenious clearings-up one fain would see Beside that plain inscription of The Nameâ The Patriot Pym, or the Apostate Strafford! [The Children resume their song timidly, but break off. Enter Hollis and an Attendant. Strafford. No,âHollis? in good time!âWho is he? Hollis. One That must be present. Strafford. AhâI understand. They will not let me see poor Laud alone. How politic! They'd use me by degrees To solitude: and, just as you came in, I was solicitous what life to lead When Strafford's ânot so much as Constable âIn the King's service.â Is there any means To keep oneself awake? What would you do After this bustle, Hollis, in my place? Hollis. Strafford! Strafford. Observe, not but that Pym and you Will find me news enoughânews I shall hear Under a quince-tree by a fish-pond side At Wentworth. Garrard must be re-engaged My newsman. Or, a better project nowâ What if when all's consummated, and the Saints Reign, and the Senate's work goes swimmingly,â What if I venture up, some day, unseen, To saunter through the Town, notice how Pym, Your Tribune, likes Whitehall, drop quietly Into a tavern, hear a point discussed, As, whether Strafford's name were John or Jamesâ And be myself appealed toâI, who shall Myself have near forgotten! Hollis. I would speak . . . Strafford. Then you shall speak,ânot now. I want just now, To hear the sound of my own tongue. This place Is full of ghosts. Hollis. Nay, you must hear me, Strafford! Strafford. Oh, readily! Only, one rare thing more,â The minister! Who will advise the King, Turn his Sejanus, Richelieu and what not, And yet have healthâchildren, for aught I knowâ My patient pair of traitors! Ah,âbut, Williamâ Does not his cheek grow thin? William. 'T is you look thin, Father! Strafford. A scamper o'er the breezy wolds Sets all to-rights. Hollis. You cannot sure forget A prison-roof is o'er you, Strafford? Strafford. No, Why, no. I would not touch on that, the first. I left you that. Well, Hollis? Say at once, The King can find no time to set me free! A mask at Theobald's? Hollis. Hold: no such affair Detains him. Strafford. True: what needs so great a matter? The Queen's lip may be sore. Well: when he pleases,â Only, I want the air: it vexes flesh To be pent up so long. Hollis. The KingâI bear His message, Strafford: pray you, let me speak! Strafford. Go, William! Anne, try o'er your song again! [The Children retire. They shall be loyal, friend, at all events. I know your message: you have nothing new To tell me: from the first I guessed as much. I know, instead of coming here himself, Leading me forth in public by the hand, The King prefers to leave the door ajar As though I were escapingâbids me trudge While the mob gapes upon some show prepared On the other side of the river! Give at once His order of release! I've heard, as well Of certain poor manÅuvres to avoid The granting pardon at his proper risk; First, he must prattle somewhat to the Lords, Must talk a trifle with the Commons first, Be grieved I should abuse his confidence, And far from blaming them, and . . . Where's the order? Hollis. Spare me! Strafford. Why, he'd not have me steal away? With an old doublet and a steeple hat Like Prynne's? Be smuggled into France, perhaps? Hollis, 't is for my children! 'T was for them I first consented to stand day by day And give your Puritans the best of words, Be patient, speak when called upon, observe Their rules, and not return them prompt their lie! What's in that boy of mine that he should prove Son to a prison-breaker? I shall stay And he'll stay with me. Charles should know as much, He too has children! [Turning to Hollis's Companion.] Sir, you feel for me! No need to hide that face! Though it have looked Upon me from the judgment-seat . . . I know Strangely, that somewhere it has looked on me . . . Your coming has my pardon, nay, my thanks: For there is one who comes not. Hollis. Whom forgive, As one to die! Strafford. True, all die, and all need Forgiveness: I forgive him from my soul. Hollis. 'T is a world's wonder: Strafford, you must die! Strafford. Sir, if your errand is to set me free This heartless jest mars much. Ha! Tears in truth? We'll end this! See this paper, warmâfeelâwarm With lying next my heart! Whose hand is there? Whose promise? Read, and loud for God to hear! âStrafford shall take no hurtââread it, I say! âIn person, honour, nor estateââ Hollis. The King . . . Strafford. I could unking him by a breath! You sit Where Loudon sat, who came to prophesy The certain end, and offer me Pym's grace If I'd renounce the King: and I stood firm On the King's faith. The King who lives . . . Hollis. To sign The warrant for your death. Strafford âPut not your trust âIn princes, neither in the sons of men, âIn whom is no salvation!â Hollis. Trust in God! The scaffold is prepared: they wait for you: He has consented. Cast the earth behind! Charles. You would not see me, Strafford, at your foot! It was wrung from me! Only, curse me not! Hollis [to Strafford]. As you hope grace and pardon in your need, Be merciful to this most wretched man. [Voices from within. Verso la sera Di Primavera. Strafford. You'll be good to those children, sir? I know You'll not believe her, even should the Queen Think they take after one they rarely saw. I had intended that my son should live A stranger to these matters: but you are So utterly deprived of friends! He too Must serve youâwill you not be good to him? Or, stay, sir, do not promiseâdo not swear! You, Hollisâdo the best you can for me! I've not a soul to trust to: Wandesford's dead, And you've got Radcliffe safe, Laud's turn comes next: I've found small time of late for my affairs, But I trust any of you, Pym himselfâ No one could hurt them: there's an infant, too. These tedious cares! Your Majesty could spare them. Nayâpardon me, my King! I had forgotten Your education, trials, much temptation, Some weakness: there escaped a peevish wordâ 'T is gone: I bless you at the last. You know All's between you and me: what has the world To do with it? Farewell! Charles [at the door]. Balfour! Balfour! Enter Balfour. The Parliament!âgo to them: I grant all Demands. Their sittings shall be permanent: Tell them to keep their money if they will: I'll come to them for every coat I wear And every crust I eat: only I choose To pardon Strafford. As the Queen shall choose! âYou never heard the People howl for blood, Beside! Balfour. Your Majesty may hear them now: The walls can hardly keep their murmurs out: Please you retire! Charles. Take all the troops, Balfour! Balfour. There are some hundred thousand of the crowd Charles. Come with me, Strafford! You'll not fear, at least! Strafford. Balfour, say nothing to the world of this! I charge you, as a dying man, forget You gazed upon this agony of one . . . Of one . . . or if . . . why you may say, Balfour, The King was sorry: 't is no shame in him: Yes, you may say he even wept, Balfour, And that I walked the lighter to the block Because of it. I shall walk lightly, sir! Earth fades, heaven breaks on me: I shall stand next Before God's throne: the moment's close at hand When man the first, last time, has leave to lay His whole heart bare before its Maker, leave To clear up the long error of a life And choose one happiness for evermore. With all mortality about me, Charles, The sudden wreck, the dregs of violent deathâ What if, despite the opening angel-song, There penetrate one prayer for you? Be saved Through me! Bear witness, no one could prevent My death! Lead on! ere he awakeâbest, now! All must be ready: did you say, Balfour, The crowd began to murmur? They'll be kept Too late for sermon at St. Antholin's! Now! But tread softlyâchildren are at play In the next room. Precede! I followâ Enter Lady Carlisle, with many Attendants. Lady Carlisle. Me! Follow me, Strafford, and be saved! The King? [To the King.] Wellâas you ordered, they are ranged without, The convoy . . . [seeing the King's state.] [To Strafford.] You know all, then! Why, I thought It looked best that the King should save you,âCharles Alone; 't is a shame that you should owe me aught. Or no, not shame! Strafford, you'll not feel shame At being saved by me? Hollis. All true! Oh Strafford, She saves you! all her deed! this lady's deed! And is the boat in readiness? You, friend, Are Billingsley, no doubt. Speak to her, Strafford! See how she trembles, waiting for your voice! The world's to learn its bravest story yet. Lady Carlisle. Talk afterward! Long nights in France enough, To sit beneath the vines and talk of home. Strafford. You love me, child? Ah, Strafford can be loved As well as Vane! I could escape, then? Lady Carlisle. Haste! Advance the torches, Bryan! Strafford. I will die. They call me proud: but England had no right, When she encountered meâher strength to mineâ To find the chosen foe a craven. Girl, I fought her to the utterance, I fell, I am her's now, and I will die. Beside, The lookers-on! Eliot is all about This place, with his most uncomplaining brow. Lady Carlisle. Strafford! Strafford. I think if you could know how much I love you, you would be repaid, my friend! Lady Carlisle. Then, for my sake! Strafford. Even for your sweet sake, I stay. Hollis. For their sake! Strafford. To bequeath a stain? Leave me! Girl, humour me and let me die! Lady Carlisle. Bid him escapeâwake, King! Bid him escape! Strafford. True, I will go! Die, and forsake the King? I'll not draw back from the last service. Lady Carlisle. Strafford! Strafford. And, after all, what is disgrace to me? Let us come, child! That it should end this way! Lead then! but I feel strangely: it was not To end this way. Lady Carlisle. Leanâlean on me! Strafford. My King! Oh, had he trusted meâhis friend of friends! Lady Carlisle. I can support him, Hollis! Strafford. Not this way! This gateâI dreamed of it, this very gate. Lady Carlisle. It opens on the river: our good boat Is moored below, our friends are there. Strafford. The same: Only with something ominous and dark, Fatal, inevitable. Lady Carlisle. Strafford! Strafford! Strafford. Not by this gate! I feel what will be there! I dreamed of it, I tell you: touch it not! Lady Carlisle. To save the King,âStrafford, to save the King! [As Strafford opens the door, Pym is discovered with Hampden, Vane, etc. Strafford falls back; Pym follows slowly and confronts him. Pym. Have I done well? Speak, England! Whose sole sake I still have laboured for, with disregard To my own heart,âfor whom my youth was made Barren, my manhood waste, to offer up Her sacrificeâthis friend, this Wentworth hereâ Who walked in youth with me, loved me, it may be, And whom, for his forsaking England's cause, I hunted by all means (trusting that she Would sanctify all means) even to the block Which waits for him. And saying this, I feel No bitterer pang than first I felt, the hour I swore that Wentworth might leave us, but I Would never leave him: I do leave him now. I render up my charge (be witness, God!) To England who imposed it. I have done Her biddingâpoorly, wrongly,âit may be, With ill effectsâfor I am weak, a man: Still, I have done my best, my human best, Not faltering for a moment. It is done. And this said, if I say . . . yes, I will say I never loved but one manâDavid not More Jonathan! Even thus, I love him now: And look for my chief portion in that world Where great hearts led astray are turned again, (Soon it may be, and, certes, will be soon: My mission over, I shall not live long,)â Ay, here I know I talkâI dare and must, Of England, and her great reward, as all I look for there; but in my inmost heart, Believe, I think of stealing quite away To walk once more with Wentworthâmy youth's friend Purged from all error, gloriously renewed, And Eliot shall not blame us. Then indeed . . . This is no meeting, Wentworth! Tears increase Too hot. A thin mistâis it blood?âenwraps The face I loved once. Then, the meeting be! Strafford. I have loved England too; we'll meet then, Pym. As well die now! Youth is the only time To think and to decide on a great course: Manhood with action follows; but't is dreary, To have to alter our whole life in ageâ The time past, the strength gone! As well die now. When we meet, Pym, I'd be set rightânot now! Best die. Then if there's any fault, fault too Dies, smothered up. Poor grey old little Laud May dream his dream out, of a perfect Church, In some blind corner. And there's no one left. I trust the King now wholly to you, Pym! And yet, I know not: I shall not be there: Friends failâif he have any. And he's weak, And loves the Queen, and . . . Oh, my fate is nothingâ Nothing! But not that awful headânot that! Pym. If England shall declare such will to me . . . Strafford. Pym, you help England! I, that am to die, What I must see! 't is hereâall here! My God, Let me but gasp out, in one word of fire, How thou wilt plague him, satiating hell! What? England that you help, become through you A green and putrefying charnel, left Our children . . . some of us have children, Pymâ Some who, without that, still must ever wear A darkened brow, an over-serious look, And never properly be young! No word? What if I curse you? Send a strong curse forth Clothed from my heart, lapped round with horror till She's fit with her white face to walk the world Scaring kind natures from your cause and youâ Then to sit down with you at the board-head, The gathering for prayer . . . O speak, but speak! . . . Creep up, and quietly follow each one home, You, you, you, be a nestling care for each To sleep with,âhardly moaning in his dreams, She gnaws so quietly,âtill, lo he starts, Gets off with half a heart eaten away! Oh, shall you 'scape with less if she's my child? You will not say a wordâto meâto Him? Pym. If England shall declare such will to me . . . Strafford. No, not for England now, not for Heaven now,â See, Pym, for my sake, mine who kneel to you! There, I will thank you for the death, my friend! This is the meeting: let me love you well! Pym. England,âI am thine own! Dost thou exact That service? I obey thee to the end. Strafford. O God, I shall die firstâI shall die first!</field>
