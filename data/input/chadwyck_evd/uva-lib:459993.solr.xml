      <field name="fulltext">MEROPE. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Her Grace the Dutchess of Newcastle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. By Aaron Hill, Esq; Spoken by Mr. Milward. In Italy, not fam'd for Sense, but Song, Our Merope first rose, and flourish'd long: E'en there she fir'd the heart with tragic rage; And swell'd the Tuscan and the Roman stage. Thence has our Author drawn his Muse's aid; The first fair plunder English wit has made. Sound, to our cost, they long have sent us o'er; But Sense is what they never lent before Oh smile upon the capture; nor refuse To grant reprisals to your Country's Muse. Yet has our Author (a fast friend to Love) Disdain'd to imitate, and not improve. Th'Italian scenes were gloom'd with deep despair; Here softer passions mix a gentler care: Here Grief and Love by turns their int'rest press, And shade the smile of joy with stern distress. Yet claims our modest writer no pretence To task the Audience in his Play's defence: Freely condemn it, if it fails to move; Or smile it into life, if you approve. The untam'd Genius of the British Nation Disdains constraint, but smiles on resignation: And when in Wit or Love we take the field, The surest way to conquer is to yield.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. By Aaron Hill, Esq; Intended to have been spoken. Of all the tricks these Poets bring in vague, Methinks their strangest whim is Epilogue. Hard task on us poor Damsels of the Stage! An Author's faint Endeavours fire your rage; And when that rage inflames you to abhor him, He pops in one of us to cool you for him. 'Tis an ungentle treatment to perplex With strongest danger thus the weakest sex. Troth one would thinkâbut Custom's hard to stemâ That They should do for Us, not We for Them. But be it soâI care not, tho' I venture, Could I but see on what soft side to enter. Grave Gentlemen, some of ye look so sadly, That, troth, I fear I shall come off but badly. Yet, hang it, I've begunâTh'event I'll try; And if I'm doom'd to fall, why, there I'll lie. For our new Author then, and for his Play, I have one vast important truth to say; Smile on his hopesâDoâfor my sake forbear him; Not that my wishes bid your justice spare him: But, should you not, you would but make me trouble: He'll write till you approve, and plague me double.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, the Palace in Messene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Terrace Walk. Enter Euryalus and Argaleon. Euryalus. Look but abroad, 'tis sun-shine all around us; While our Messene, this abandon'd spot, Is drench'd in heavy show'rs of human blood; And all the storm beats here. Arg. O thou, who wert Our guardian once, immortal Hercules! What fate, injurious to thy fair renown, Has rais'd a Monster from thy tainted blood? Ev'n all the Monsters, which thy valour crush'd, Are now reviv'd in thy descendant Glycon. Wouldst thou assert thy Deity, and crown The glorious labours of thy virtue here, Swift as the bolt that arms thy thund'ring Sire, Dart this infernal plague to shades below; And let the Furies, that ev'n now possess him, That feed his rage, and haunt his guilty dreams, Torment th'Usurper in their proper mansion. Eur. What was my Father's crime? His large Possessions, His Hospitality, his shining Worth; Rank treason All! The fears of impious pow'r Were heighten'd into proofs that turn'd against him The tyrant's sharpest sword, perverted Law. Arg. You know he did but dream my Brother stabb'd him, And plung'd the visionary criminal Deep in a dungeon, stripp'd of all his wealth. Eur. When 'tis to warrant cruelty and rapine, The heav'nly Pow'rs, whose Being he denies In words and actions, are profanely vouch'd, And idle dreams stil'd Messengers from Jove. Arg. From Bacchus rather in luxurious draughts. Eur. But are we sunk so womanishly low, That we can only mourn, and rail, and pray? The genial heat of heav'n-born liberty Once ripen'd Patriot spirits into Heroes; And half the Stars, that shine in yonder sky, Were Mortals here below, who dy'd, or conquer'd, To save their country from the fear of chains; Which We can feel; yet crouch, and lick the dust Beneath the feet that trample us. Arg. The Fear Might raise our Courage; but the Feeling sinks it. The pulse beats high and strong in common fevers; But when 'tis languishing and faint, betrays The fatal force of those malignant fires That drink the vital flood. Eur. Have comfort yet, And trust revolving Fortune, infinite In changes unforeseen. The wayward Goddess Has rais'd the wretch aloft in fatal sport, To let him fall with greater force. Arg. She has: Or young Cleander was preserv'd in vain, When King Cresfontes, his lamented Father, And both his Brothers, sacrific'd at once To Glycon's fury, swell'd the hungry grave. Eur. Add his concealment in a foreign land, From all the hundred eyes of jealous pow'r, Full fifteen years deluded in their search By his more watchful guard, a Mother's love. Arg. An anxious love to Merope; for oh! What endless doubts and apprehensions haunt her! Her only comfort is to nourish hope, By hearing once a year her darling lives. Arbantes was dispatch'd a while ago On that dear errand, and returns to-day. Nay moreâbe secret and prepar'd. Eur. For what? Arg. Revenge and Freedom. By the Queen's command He brings Cleander home. Eur. Be thank'd, ye Powers! Give us but Him to head the glorious cause; And halting Justice shall resume her sword, So long athirst in vain for Glycon's blood. Arg. No more. But clear your brow; for, see, he comes, Attended by his Ministers of Death. Enter Glycon, Nicanor, Adrastus, and Phalantus. Gly. Tell me, Nicanor, will these restive slaves Be never scourg'd into a better mind By wholsome discipline? Eur. I hope they will not. [Aside. Nic. Monarchs, ador'd at first, are hated oft, As Times, as Interests, or as Humours turn; But hated once, are seldom lov'd again. Gly. The scowl of louring discontent insults me In ev'ry face I meet: They all look Treason; And all should perish to secure my peace. Nic. The villain vulgar, ever prone to change, Extol the Prince they have no more: 'Tis death Endears Cresfontes to their hearts; and now They long in secret for his heir, whose life Endangers yours. Arg. The life of young Cleander? You know he lost it in its Infant Dawn, Snatch'd from his cradle to the grave. Gly. No more; Or vent thy tale henceforth to fools. That One Of Merope's detested race survives, Was ever past dispute. Pha. Yet all our arts Have fail'd to trace him out. Nic. May I have leave To offer one Expedient more? Gly. You have. Nic. 'Tis making Merope confess the secret. Adr. Confess? Betray a Son she fondly loves? Nic. Yet not more fondly than she lov'd her husband; Nor therefore more than she perhaps may learn To love my gracious Lord. Eur. What would the Villain? [Aside. Gly. I lov'd her once; and loveâmy Interest still. Nic. That Interest points the Marriage out, to gain The stupid Many by an idle hope, That She, the Widow of their fav'rite King, May change you to a peaceful drone like Him. Gly. Suppose she should deny? Nic. A groundless doubt. Secure the first impression, Sir, and then Your work is half perform'd. Pha. When once she yields, Howe'er reluctant, to become your Wife, Your well-tim'd Flatt'ries then, and kind Caresses, The Racks of Love, may force discovery from her, And drag her Son to light. Gly. But you misjudge, My Friends, of Merope's unshaken spirit. Her Sex's frailty is no standard there. Nic. Admit the worst; that Artifice should fail To bend her pride and obstinancy; then You must resort to menaces and force. Adr. A finish'd Policitian! Well! if conscience Comes by descent, my Mother gave me mine. [Aside. Nic. Resolve, whate'er it cost, to make her yours; And grace the Nuptials with Imperial pomp; That all may understand the compliment You make your People in the choice of Her, The Widow of a Prince they lov'd so well. Gly. Nicanor, you have argu'd right; and soon We'll make the trial. Eur. This the Queen should know. Arg. But how to break it to her is a point Not to be here debated. [Apart. [Exeunt Arg. and Eur. Nic. Look, my Lord! For Merope, your future Bride, approaches. Gly. We must avoid her, till maturer thought Has well digested this important Scheme. Adr. Ismene with the Queen! but I shall watch My opportunity to disengage her. [Aside.] [Exeunt. Enter Merope, Timoclea, and Ismene. Mer. Be this my anchor thenâthe Gods are righteous; And, in proportion to my suff'rings here, My credit rises on Futurity For ampler recompence. A filial trust In Heav'n all-good, to those who think aright Endears affliction; and extends their view Beyond the narrow Scene of human woe, To bright reversions of unfading bliss, Where my Cresfontes dwells. Tim. Be comforted, My Royal Mistress; for my heart abounds With gay, presaging warmth, the harbinger Of happier fortune. A long absent Son Shall bless your eyes, while mine with rival joy Salute a Father whom they never saw. Mer. 'Tis true: When faithful Polydorus bore My child in secret, hence; your birth, Timoclea, Expected long in vain, had just rejoic'd His then declining ageâyour Mother wept; Embrac'd him o'er and o'er with boding fondness, And took her last AdieuâOh! happy She, Who dying left the Partner of her bed, And You, their only pledge of love, behind! But I have liv'd to see my Husband slainâ The daggers, reeking in my Childrens blood, Were brandish'd in my eyes by Ruffian handsâ Still one remaining Son supported meâ For ChildrenâHusbandâall surviv'd in himâ And now, if my divining fears are true, Ev'n He, my last reserve of hope and comfortâ I cannot speak the rest. Ism. Unfold, I beg you, The cruel cause of this distress. Mer. My Dream Of yesternight sits heavy here. I saw, Just as he look'd when in the pangs of death, My murder'd LordâTears streaming from his eyes; Blood from his woundsâa purple shroud he wore; And held in either hand a bleeding son; Each pointing to his mangled breast. Tim. Ye Powers! What could the dire distracting vision mean? Mer. Imagine, if you can, my wild amaze, My horror, and my agonizing pain. I would have found it but a dream, and strove To break the tyrant chain of sleep, but could not: Till in a falt'ring tone, at length I ask'd him Of our surviving SonâHe shook his head, And groan'd without replyâI shriek'd aloud; Leap'd from my trembling bed; and wak'd in tears. Ism. Alas! I shudder at the bare relation Of what you underwent. But we expect Arbantes ev'ry hour; I hope with tidings To ease your fearsâAnd oh, my Queen! behold The man I nam'd, as fate just now had sent him. Enter Arbantes. Arb. [Kneeling.] My Royal Mistress! Mer. Is my Son alive? Arb. He is; and Polydorus too. Tim. The gods Be prais'd! Mer. And thanks to thee, Arbantes. Welcome now: For welcome was a word my tongue refus'd, Before you told me I was still a Mother. Arb. A day or two ere I arriv'd, he went To visit Sparta: But a messenger Was instantly dispatch'd by Polydorus, With proper orders to direct him hither. Tim. And Polydorusâ Arb. Will arrive ere long. At once we started; but by diff'rent ways: For such was Your command. [To Merope. Mer. A happy thought. Had Glycon's spies encounter'd you together, I tremble but to think on what had follow'd. Arb. Your son is single too; but then, unknown For what he is, and ignorant himself Of his high birth, he travels unsuspected; And, but from common accidents, secure. Mer. O could you but have seen him, to resolve A thousand questions I should then have ask'd you. And now a miser's thirst inflames my soul To view my long-hid treasure, and recall His Father's image; for there was a promise Of likeness dawning in his infant face. Arb. Excuse my weakness, that declines a theme Beyond the reach of words. The Prince's worth (If he who knows it best, deserves belief) Can only speak itself. Mer. My best Arbantes! Thy tidings, welcome as refreshing dew, Distil serenely on my wither'd heart, That deeply drinks the blessing, and revives In all the bloom of hope. My fancy's eye Already figures my young fiery warrior Redeeming at a blow his lost Messene: The grim Usurper's gushing blood appears To paint his face, and add to glowing youth A purple more divine. Arb. Reserve your transports, Illustrious Queen, to entertain your Son. Mer. My Transports then will rise too high for language: Then for the fix'd regard! the close embrace! The silent ecstacy! Nay, wonder not At what you hear: For oh let These declare, If I have pass'd a day in their remembrance, Excepting this, which they would wish to see me Live o'er again. Tim., Ism. O never. Mer. Pardon then The wild excesses of a change like this: Joy has a stranger's privilege with me; And claims th'abundance of my soul to treat it. Tim. But, Madam; you forget the hour is come To offer holy vows to chaste Lucina, For this auspicious day, that witness'd first Your darling infant's cries, and now restores him. Mer. O Goddess! thou, whose sacred aid reliev'd The pangs that gave Cleander to the light, Protect him now; guide all his steps; and let Messene, rescu'd by his arm, proclaim His second happier birth to empire, and to fame. [Exeunt. Enter Adrastus, and stops Ismene. Adr. The Queen may spare you for a while, Ismene; She must, in pity to a lover's pain. Ism. Away, my Lord; you mock my easy faith. But 'tis no wonder that Nicanor's Son Can play the Statesman too, and learn deceit, The constant curse of fond believing love. Adr. Deceit in love! be that suspicion far From this soft breast, the mansion and reward Of endless truth; sweet as the spring's first odours, And kind as fancy warm with young desire. Thus let me clasp my dear Ismeneâthusâ [Embracing her. And melt her fears away. Ism. Forbear, Adrastus. Adr. O why that cruel frown? The bliss deny'd Is punishment enough. When mortals pray, (For want will pray, where merit cannot claim) The Gods are often deaf, but never angry. Ism. They must forget their nature, to be angry With pious suppliants. Is that title yours? Perhaps the vows of your distemper'd heart Are breath'd in secret, and avoid the light Of Hymen's holy torch. Adr. Why name you Hymen? A peevish Father, yours or mine, may bar The door against him, and plant Duty there, With Int'rest, or the noisy phantom, Honour, To guard the passage. Ism. But when time has laid Those sentinels asleepâ Adr. Alas, my Fair, Then love, neglected long, may slumber too. With rev'rence treat the beck'ning God, who comes not, Nor stays, at our command. He now invites us: And, dear Ismene, Now alone is ours. Ism. O Chastity! inviolable Goddess Of well-descended minds! thou friend confess'd To sylvan pastimes and to rural toil! If I have lodg'd thee here, with youth and pomp, Beneath a gilded roof, on beds of down; And made thee triumph o'er the wanton song, The costly banquet, and the midnight dance, Safe in the last recesses of my soul; Why hast thou suffer'd such unhallow'd sounds To taint his lips, and wound Ismene's ear? [Weeps. Adr. What means my Love? Ism. What means Adrastus, rather, Who won my heart by honourable vows? For such I thought them once. O why so long Chose you to counterfeit? Had you begun To tempt me thus, I had disdain'd you then; And should disdain you now. Adr. Forgive the starts Of ardent love, or say (and kill me quite) You never felt its pow'r. Ism. I urg'd at first The disproportion of my humble fortune; Begg'd you would cease to undermine my soul With flatt'ring hopes, and own'd you stoop'd too low. Adr. Who would not stoop to crop so fair a flow'r? Ism. To taste its sweets, and then to throw it by? Is it not so? Adr. To wear it here for ever. Ism. What envious pow'r, to innocence a foe, Made you disturb the calm I once enjoy'd, But ne'er shall find again? Adr. A calm well chang'd For gentle quarrels, such as ours has been, That stir the soul, not ruffle it. Believe me, These tender jealousies, and kind disquiets, Do but awake desire, and then are hush'd; Soft as Etesian gales, that cease at night. Ism. Be still, my heart, and trust him; tho' in love, As in an untry'd voyage, images Of danger and distress will still alarm The Sailor, launching on a boundless sea, Howe'er the sky may smile. But once again To try that interest your heart allows me, I must sollicit it for dear Timoclea. She has a suit to Glycon: Will you promise To be her advocate? Adr. To your commands With joy I dedicate my faithful service; A grateful convert to the pow'r divine Of Virtue, glowing in Ismene's cheeks; That, blushing like the morn, restor'd the day, When my benighted soul began to stray; And chas'd the Fiend, licentious Love, away. [Exeunt. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SCENE Continues. Enter Glycon and Nicanor. Glycon. You say, the rumour of our purpos'd match Already works as you and I could wish. Nic. It spreads apace, and captivates the vulgar, As I foretold it would. It now remains To think of somewhat that may please the Queen, And introduce you with advantage there. Enter Adrastus, and delivers a Paper. Adr. Permit me, Royal Sir, to offer This. Timoclea, stripp'd of her inheritance, Implores your goodness to allow a claim, Not forfeited (as she presumes to hope) E'en by her Father's treason. Gly. She mistakes. Possession is against her; and the sword Has cut her title short. Nic. But if your Wisdom Yields to her suit, it hits the point in view, By gratifying Merope, whose ward Timoclea is. Adr. Her ward and favourite. Gly. Why there the question is intirely chang'd; A question now no longer. Her desire Is granted; for it smooths the way to mine. We would not be suppos'd of choice to practise A lean Plebeian virtue; but the Great Themselves may now-and-then, without a blush, Declare for justice when it serves their int'rest. [A noise without. Ha! what alarm is that? Inquire, Adrastus. [Exit Adrastus. My guards, Nicanor! Speakâwhere are they, Traitor? Revolted? Nic. Surely no. Gly. They are; and treason Knocks at my palace gate unmask'd. Re-enter Adrastus and Phalantos. Adr. The tumult Is over now. But whence it rose, Phalantus Can best inform you. Phal. I have seiz'd a murd'rer Fresh from the fact; that all unhappy omens, Averted by his punishment, may fly To distant regions, he shall never boast Of baffling our Messene's laws. Gly. Who is he? Phal. He seems a stranger. Gly. Who the person slain? Phal. I know not; cast into the whelming stream, His body sunk at once. Gly. What proof produce you To warrant this? Pha. The Criminal's confession. Soon as the Chace had summon'd me abroad, I heard of one just robb'd and kill'd. The robber, They told me, fled along the river side. We follow'd on the spur, and overtook him Close by the Palace wall; he drew his sword Still blushing with the blood so lately spilt, And yielded not, till after a resistance That spoke uncommon Valour. Gly. Rather say, Uncommon Insolence. And could he dare, So near our person, to affront our power? Pha. A Ring, too costly to belong to Him, I pull'd from off his finger, and present it [Giving Glycon a Ring. In confirmation of a a charge, which else His fair appearance might almost disprove. His aspect and his sentiments are noble, Disguis'd in low degree and mean attire. Gly. Where is he? bring th'offender in; this Ring [Exit Phalantus. Is demonstration. Have you ever seen [Shewing the Ring. A Gem so nicely wrought? and, for its price, Our Crown has none so rich. Re-enter Phalantus, with Egistus. Pha. Great Sir, behold The guilty person. Gly. Is this he, who rais'd The cry of blood, and then profan'd our Court With rude alarms and sacrilegious force? Who are you? what you are appears too plain. So young a Murd'rer! Egist. You misplace the name On him who would not change these humble weeds For purple stain'd with blood. Egistus, proud Of honest poverty, am I. My birthâ Gly. Dream'd you the Sceptre fill'd our hands in vain? Or thought we tolerated robbers? Egis. Yes; Illustrious, wealthy Robbers. I am needy; And plunder is a crime, when join'd with want; Want the worst crime. I cannot purchase pardon; Or if I could, my Innocence disdains it, And is its own Sollicitor. My plea Is self-defence. I but prevented Him Who would have murder'd Me. This witness, Jove? Gly. The common cheat of hypocrites, to vouch A witness out of call. Relate your story. Egis. As I pursu'd my solitary way, A savage wretch (for such his aspect spoke him) Scarce older than myself, advanc'd to meet me. His sword he brandish'd; and his ardent eyes, Which, rolling first at leisure round, assur'd him That help was far away, shot sternly on me Their angry glances, and forbad my passage Across the bridge, which both at once we gain'd. He grip'd my arm, and menac'd present death: With ready strength I loos'd his hold, and drew: We fought a while, then clos'd and fell together; Nor know I, if I found him underneath me By accident or skill; but lifted high My shorten'd sword, and plung'd it in his heart. Gly. 'Tis well! you murder'd, and then robb'd: Proceed. Egis. I guess'd the body of the slain, expos'd To common view, would draw a warm pursuit From ev'ry quarter; and to fly was vain. I therefore chose to cast it o'er the bridge, From the mid arch, within the swelling stream. Gly. But tell me, trifler, why the dead was hurry'd From the survey of Justice; which requires Full satisfaction where a life is lost, Egis. 'Twas not for guilt that I declin'd the Test; But, bent on speed, I us'd the likeliest means To shun delay. The judge within, my conscience, I had already satisfy'd; and, trust me, I fear offending That, when most retir'd, Beyond the lifted arm of angry Pow'r. Gly. No more evasions, as you prize your life. Egis. I prize it not, nor would prolong it, but On worthy terms. Where Virtue is the centre, The circle may be small, but must be perfect. Gly. Are Life and Death indiff'rent to you? Egis. No. Life is my choice; for Nature shrinks from death; And dying now would balk a thousand glories, That crouding forward wait upon my Genius, And wing my fancy to the heights of Fame. I have a Father too who lives in Me; And in that thought my scorn of death is vanish'd; For I must fear for Him, and beg for life, Spare his in sparing mine. Gly. But whence this Ring Found on you by Phalanthus? it confronts Your weak defence, and aggravates your guilt By the high rank of him you stripp'd and slew. Egis. You wrong my Innocence. Once more I claim That Ring; no booty, but my Father's gift. Gly. And could the Father of a Son so mean Bestow a gift of value to adorn Th'Assyrian Monarch's Crown? Egis. He could, and did. So may the Gods, that guard this Royal roof, Protect their Suppliant from his threaten'd doom, As at Jove's Altar my indulgent Sire Gave me the Ring, wept o'er me, and engag'd My solemn vow that I would ever wear it. Gly. A well invented Tale! he never wants A specious plea, whom none can contradict. Who ever yet accus'd himself? but I, The watchful Guardian of offended Law, Rise at the call of blood. Be sure you bring Some witness worthy of belief. Egis. I do; Myself. Suspecting my integrity, You wrong your own. Gly. Audacious wretch, to brave The bended brow of Majesty! secure him In strict confinement to receive his doom. [Exeunt Egistus and Phalantus. Nicanor, what if, to oblige the Queen Yet farther, I present her This? [The Ring] a proof That what I do in favour to her Creature, Is purpos'd as a mark of grace to Her. Nic. A thought becoming Glycon's wisdom! Gly. Here. [Giving the Ring to Nicanor. And let Timoclea bear it to her Mistress; My Mistress now; and That the Ring to join us. Enter a Messenger. Mes. My Lord, the Sacrifice, ordain'd in honour Of your intended Nuptials with the Queen, Awaits your presence. Gly. Glorious pageantry To catch the vulgar! but what slaves are Kings, Forc'd to be Players in so stale a Farce! [Exit Glycon. [Adrastus is following. Nic. With you, my Son, a word. Adr. Some heav'nly Power Inspir'd my Father with that happy turn, That mov'd the King to grant Timoclea's pray'r. Nic. You are a stranger yet to half my project, And owe me more than you imagine. Adr. Ha! Nic. It glads me that Timoclea chose my Son Of all Mankind to patronize her cause. Adr. Not she, my Lord; but my Ismene for her. Nic. Argaleon's Daughter! Peace for shame, and quit That grov'ling passion as you dread my curse, Your only portion, if you disobey. Adr. Recall your sentence, or resume my life, A worthless gift; for what is life without her? Nic. And with her, what but Misery and Shame? Ambition was your darling passion once; How can it stoop so vilely to adopt The younger Branch of an attainted race, And on my stock graft poverty and treason? Adr. The cruel weight of what you urge has struck A chilling damp into my heart. Let Her Deny or grant my suit, each way 'tis fatal, If not approv'd by You. But oh! my Father, Unless you own that tender name in vain; If Nature, pleading for a once lov'd Son, Has any influence leftâ Nic. Prepare your heart To taste the sweets of change, and entertain A Father's wiser choice. A Father's, said I? It must be sure your own. Fate takes th'occasion From this day's work, and points Timoclea to you; A beauteous heiress now. Adr. But my addresses May come too lateâsome other loveâ Nic. Away. Henceforward cease to call Nicanor Father, Or act your part without reserve. This Ring, With Glycon's compliment to Merope, I must with speed deliver to Timoclea: But ere she carries it, I send her hither To own your service, and receive your vows. [Exit Nicanor. Adr. Farewel my Honour thenâI cannot add With equal case and truth, farewel Remorse; That stings me to the soul for poor Ismene. The softâbelievingâinjur'dâHa!âRemorse; And nothing more! He were a harden'd villain Who felt not ThatâBut what is he who feels it, And perseveres? A greaterâfor he braves Convictionâand for what? His int'restâMost Have that to plead; and what have I besides? But, oh! how sordid is that plea in Love, Which soars above it still in gen'rous minds! And so it would in mine. But holdâmy Father Has interpos'd the bar of filial dutyâ There let it restâI shall discover all To my worst foe, ReflectionâHonesty, I must allow thee thisâno peace can mix With crimes, unless the close offender hides 'em From his own view, as from the world'sâI dare not Look farther inâAlas for giddy Reason, When lost in thought's fantastic Mazes! Reason, That like the dog attending some blind vagrant, Guides, and is guided too; while he the wretch, Who holds the string, still wanders in the dark; And slowly gropes his way, in fear and danger Of stumbling ev'ry step. But now begins My part, a Player's part, to feign desire, And glow with painted flames. Enter Timoclea. Tim. My Lord, your Father Tells me I have succeeded; and directs My gratitude to You. Content and honour Reward this goodness. Adr. It rewards it self. But, ah! divinely fair, though charms like yours Transcend desert, yet faithful homage paid To Beauty, is allow'd the justest claim, I dare not say, to recompence, but favour. Tim. May that be yours, the gift of Her, who won you To undertake my Cause; the fair Ismene. Adr. O! let me change Ismene for Timoclea, And then your wish is mine. Tim. A Change indeed! You mock Timoclea, or you wrong her friend. Adr. If she is wrong'd, 'tis for Your sake I wrong her. Let Her resent; but let Timoclea pardon: Or if you will resent Ismene's wrongs, Relentless to the fault your eyes inspir'd, Adrastus, doating on that fault to death, His refuge from scorn'd love, shall still embrace The glorious chain; and nurse the tender smart; Proud to offend, and pleas'd to be undone. Tim. Enough. In Justice I must tell Ismene All that has past; but you have prov'd to-day My gen'rous friend; and Gratitude requires me To wish that you may merit her forgiveness. Adieu, my Lord. Your Royal Master's service Calls me away. [Exit Timoclea. Adr. Her Coldness is enough To freeze a real passion to indiff'rence. How I despise myself! and loath the slavery That weighs me down beneath the double curse Of arbitrary power, as Son and Subject, To shame my Honour thus, and rob my Love! [Exit. SCENE changes to Merope's Apartment. Enter at one door Arbantes, at the other Euryalus and Argaleon. Eur. Arbantes! well! how left you Merope? Arb. New Sorrowsâfresh Alarms. Arg. To hear that Glycon Resolves to wed her. Arb. That concern is lost, Great as it was, in greater now. Her fears Have kill'd Cleander. Arg. How? Arb. This very day The robber slew him, for not one Messenian (She cries) is missing. Eur. Granted. Arb. The Deceas'd Must consequently be a Foreigner. Eur. But why her Son? Arb. Description and Report Chime with her fancy. He was youngâaloneâ And that which shocks her most, as well it may, He came from Sparta; and you know, the road Lies o'er the bridge, on which the Stranger fell. Arg. But does the Time agree? Arb. Too well. He might With ease ere this have reach'd his journey's end. Eur. His journey's end indeed. Arb. The pregnant clouds Hang low; and, scatter'd by our long'd-for Sun, Must vanish soon, or burst into a storm. Enter Merope and Ismene. Mer. O vain fallacious hope of joys to come! O! sole Survivor of the Royal Line! Lost, lost for ever! O unhappy Country! But most unhappy Me! Ism. Dear Madam, spareâ Mer. Awayâyou will not bar your wretched Mistress The freedom of complaintâinhuman Glycon Has still allow'd me That. Distinguish'd woe Has given Merope the privilege Of tears profusely shed, and loud laments; And piercing groans, and open execrations: While other mourners swell with stifling theirs; Or vent them to remote and lonely Echoes. Arg. But since it may be otherwiseâ Mer. It cannot; For mark the cruel artifice of Glycon. Arb. A vain surmise. For how should Glycon know? Mer. Nay; who can penetrate a Tyrant's ways? 'Tis plain to me he knew my Child's approach; And plac'd th'Assassin at the bridge to kill him; To sink the body, and conceal the fact. For, base and bloody though he is, he fear'd To tempt the fury of Mankind anew By such a Murder publickly avow'd. Enter Timoclea. Mer. O my Timoclea! all is over. Tim. No. Have comfort, Madam. At my entrance here I heard of your distress, and bring relief. Mer. My dear Timoclea, do I wake? Tim. Whoe'er Fell at the Bridge to-day, be well assur'd He could not be your Son. Mer. Once more you raise me From death to life; but how can life sustain The swift returning tide? so fierce a flow Of spirits all at once? Tim. The Prince your Son, Nurs'd in obscurity, and train'd to want, Must needs be scantily supply'd for travel. Mer. Too true, Timoclea. Tim. But the Stranger slain Was spoil'd of costly Ornaments. Mer. If so; Your inference is just. It was not he. Tell me what Ornaments. Tim. Behold this Ring; [Giving the Ring. 'Tis Glycon's gift to you. Mer. What would the Tyrant? I hate the giver, and despise the gift; And yet it comes in season now toâHa!â Tim. My gracious Mistress, is it not a Treasure? Mer. What have I seen? Ye Gods! 'tis sure the same. The hapless Youth, who lost his life to-day, Had he this Gem? Tim. He had. But, Madam, why? Why this disorder? Mer. Ye have now prevail'd, Malicious Pow'rs. And, Fortune, thou hast struck (Be satisfy'd) thy last blow. Ism. Heavens! Arb. Amazement! Tim. How my heart throbs! Mer. I gave your Father this, [To Timoclea. And swore him by my Husband's ghost to give it To my Cleander, when he grew to manhood: He grew to manhood; but, alas! in vain. Tim. What do I hear? Arg. Astonishing! Mer. I am No more a Motherâall my hopes are fled. Tim. But, Madam, may you not mistake? Reflect How many Suns have roll'd since you beheld That Ring; and can you then retain its image With such unfailing certainty? Arb. Besides, May not two Jewels, form'd by chance alike, Confound the nicest eye? Mer. How form'd alike? Or how can I mistake? Five years I wore it; The first dear Present of my husband's love; And can you dream I know it not again? What! are my senses gone? Alas! they are notâ I am not yet so happyâLook, my friend, [To Arbantes. The private Signature of King Cresfontes. Arb. Oh! the mysterious pow'r of Destiny. Ism. Her heart foretold her this by strong misgivings. Tim. Such wondrous Prophets oft are Mothers! Mer. Now, What room, Arbantes, to prolong the date Of this most wretched life? The Hope that fed it; The glimm'ring comfort of my gloomy years Is shut in endless night. These eyes no more, No, never more, shall see my Sonâand Glycon's Devoted head, the source of publick woe, May now grow white in tyrannyâUnkind And partial Deitiesâthe dire Usurperâ The TraitorâMurdererâhas flourish'd long; Enjoy'd his guilt, and glory'd in his shame. While still your poison'd shafts flew thick and sure At good Cresfontes, and his guiltless race, Now quite extinguish'd: And perhaps it grieves ye, That He, my last expiring hope, has left No future mark of your unpitying wrath. Arb. The Gods, illustrious Merope, who frown Thus to the last, have signaliz'd the wound With unexampled smart, the more to grace Your virtue. Think on That; and persevere. Eur. Let thousands daily sink in deep distress, 'Tis Yours alone to stem the stubborn tide, And triumph o'er the waves. Arb. The winding paths Of Providence divine delude our search: For who can trace the maze? Arg. Remember Him, The King of Men, in whose distinguish'd cause Greece crouded to the war, in myriads arm'd, And hid the Trojan shore. You know he offer'd His darling Daughter to a cruel death: Nor are you ignorant that Heav'n enjoin'd it. Mer. Had Heav'n enjoin'd a Mother to perform That harsh command, the pangs of female softness, Unknown to men, had made her disobey: Besides, the victim you have nam'd, with joy Hail'd the triumphant stroke that sav'd her country: Unlike the fate of him I mourn, decreed To die ignobly by a ruffian's hands. No, good Argaleonâdear Timocleaânoâ My death is fix'dâ'Tis sure, the Tyrant's wiles Found out my child; the Tyrant's hireling slew him! Else why this ring, this vile inhuman insult, This barb'rous present of unmanly spite? Had I the murd'rer in my power, the truth, In groans, should echo from the tortur'd slave; And ripping to his heart the way, I'd rend And scatter't piece-meal. O, my friends! assist me, If you are friends! But you, who fear the Gods, Must sly the wretch they all conspire to ruin. Arg. Your loss is ours, and claims our common vengeance. Mer. Then grant me, Jove, my pray'r; if pray'rs avail, In all the bitterness of soul preferr'd! If blood can cry, and royal blood be heard, Let not a Queen, a Wife, a Mother, go, Defrauded of the dear avenging blow, Her passport to Cleander's shade below. [Exeunt. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SCENE Continues. Enter Timoclea and Ismene. Ismene. And did Adrastus break his vows with case? Alas! far otherwise Ismene found it. My virgin heart, so cold to Love, sustain'd His Mines and Batteries long; but once subdu'd, Receiv'd a foe, that will not be dislodg'd. Tim. Indeed I pity you. Ism. My spirits flag, And leave me void of help; but You might watch The raving Queen, and comfort her affliction. Tim. And have not I my share of sorrow too? Yes, dear Ismene; my officious haste To ease her grief, has blasted all at once My springing hopes, and unawares expos'd The Guiltless to her rage. Ism. The Robber mean you? Tim. The Robber is miscall'd; for, dear Ismene, I saw him while he waited to receive His sentence from the King: the brave defence He made (as they inform me who beheld it) Almost exceeds belief. His single arm Held all his foes at bay; and, in his face Inflam'd with rage, and yet so fair and young, Adonis soften'd Mars. Ism. And both combin'd To charm a Venus. Tim. Ha! Ism. You colour! well, The Stranger in his turn was fir'd? Tim. He was; You would have sworn he was, had you beheld His open look, divided, as it seem'd, Between his scorn of Death and love of Me: The love, that fir'd him at first sight, Ismene, Glow'd in his cheeks, and trembled in his eyes. Ism. A soft and secret sympathy inspir'd This mutual warmth; and love no sooner touch'd Your tender heart, than his return'd the musick. Tim. Well! I am quite o'erwhelm'd with fear and shame To think what I have own'd. But take it all; Ev'n my whole Soul; for oh! the pleasing pain Of a first love, my first and last, has seiz'd it. Ye gracious Gods! have pity on his youth; And turn the Tyrant's heart; ye cannot mine. Enter Adrastus. Ism. Then lose no time to warn the Youth you love; Beset with dangers from the Queen's revenge, And Tyrant's cruelty. Adr. The Youth she loves! [Aside. Tim. What can I do? Ism. He is confin'd? Tim. He is. Ism. You know the prison opens to our garden. Use but the name of Merope; the Keeper, Her old domestic, and devoted slave, Will introduce you by that private way. But soft! Adrastus! what can bring him hither? Adr. The King intends a speedy visit here, On business of importance. Will Ismene Inform her Mistress? Tim. No, that task is mine. Ism. You need not presently return. [Apart. Tim. I will not. [Exit Timoclea. Ism. I took you, Sir, for One you much resemble; Adrastusâpardon my mistakeâhad you Been He, the transports of impatient love Had wing'd you to me with repeated vows. You had not shunn'd me then like soul infection; Nor turn'd all pale, as you had met the ghost Of some poor wretch your treachery had murder'd. Adr. You tax me justly; and behold the slave, Who would avoid you now. Ism. Inhuman! Adr. Nature Form'd us unlike each otherâTime does more, And makes us vary from ourselves as much. My Vows, when made, were meant to be perform'd.â I fain would mean so stillâbut thinkâoh! think Ismene's Lover is Nicanor's Son; And oft has begg'd and importun'd in vain A cruel Father to approve our loves. My power was short of what I fancy'd once. You may have been deceiv'd; but so was I. Ism. What! is my ruin then become your sport? A theme for Sophistry to droll on? Traitor! To varnish guilt against your soul's persuasion, And meanly trifle with a bleeding heart! Adr. Would Heav'n indulge the longings of my soul, And fashion to my wish my future life, (Ay that were life indeed) I then would fly To those soft snowy arms, and, circled there, Look down on SceptresâBy those eyes I would, Thy bright, victorious eyes; thy lips, thy bosom; By all those charms that I am doom'd to love, And never to enjoy. Ism. Is this the faith? When trust in after-times shall be betray'd, Weakness insulted, virtue undermin'd, The guilt shall all be charg'd on thy example, The scandal of thy sex, and curse of ours. Adr. Be calm, and hear me out. Ism. When perjury Has tir'd comparison for frightful colours, As perjur'd as Adrastus, shall complete The black infernal image. Adr. Hold. Ism. The sting Of future spite shall dwell in this reproach: She was no stranger to Ismene's wrongs, And yet believ'd a man. But know, when death Has disencumber'd my avenging ghost From this loath'd prison, it shall surely haunt theeâ Scream thee to madnessâpush thy treach'rous heart On thy own sword; and so perform the work Of that remorse, which men alone can feel; But Hell-born Monsters, like Adrastus, laugh at. The news that vengeance has o'ertook thy crimes, Shall reach the shades below, and comfort Me. [Pauses, and weeps. What have I done to be thus strangely wretched? My unoffending tenderness requir'd A milder doomâsure none could merit Thisâ Nor is my nature of a frame to bear it. Adr. Her sorrows wound my soul. [Aside. Ism. Ah! tell me why; Why was I singled out to be destroy'd? If oaths in love are wind, my Sex abounds In false ones, ready as your self to break 'em. O! had you not resolv'd on my undoing, I then had 'scap'd: but you pursu'd it longâ Alas! too long I was not lightly won; And spread no snares to captivate your heart; For Innocence is noneâNo, That, I find, Is made to be ensnar'd. Adr. To be ador'd. Ism. When, cruel man, your sighs, your tears, your oaths, Prevail'd at length (your titles never could); Say, did I warp the least from plighted faith? Ah! noâ'twas past my pow'râwhen I was conquer'd, 'Twas not by halvesâfor I could love but Oneâ And oh! that One was You. Adr. But now you hate meâ Doâfor I hate myself. Ism. I own, Timoclea Excells in Beauty to excuse your change: But then remember, that unless she proves As false as You, she never can be yours. Adr. Not by consent. But oh, the King, Ismene, (And Kings will be obey'd) resolves to join us; To join our handsâhe never can our heartsâ 'Tis true without an oathâfor what are oaths And imprecations now? I cannot wish So great a curse as that of losing you; And that, Ismene, is already mineâ Would it were mine aloneâoh! dry these tearsâ You may be happy in another loveâ Adrastus never can. Ism. Away, Impostor. Adr. Believe me an ImpostorâTraitorâMonsterâ If that unkind belief can give you ease, If it can make you but forget Adrastus: To your repose I'll sacrifice my honour; And all the tortures that attend our Parting, Enhanc'd by Infamy, shall doubly rack me. Ism. 'Tis wellâI've heard enoughâif ever foes Are mov'd by pity, let Ismene beg it Of you her greatest enemyâremember You had another name. By all the vows That I thought bindingâby our loves that should Have dy'd togetherâcease, O cease, to mock me Thus with a feign'd regretâI cannot bear it From him who once was kinderâyou have leave To trample on my graveâfor there Ismene Shall sleep, as unconcern'd for all her wrongs, As her Adrastus now. Farewel for ever! [Exit Ismene. Adr. Ah! dear unhappy Maid! Farewel for ever! Those were her wordsâhow mournfully they sound! But what a wretch am I, who dare be false, Yet lose my falshood's hire! She says Timoclea Will ne'er be mineâit may be soâthe Robber Has lur'd her from meâThanks for that discov'ry To ChanceâThe garden is the private way That leads her to the Youth she loves, in prison. What if I met her there? Enter Phalantus. Pha. The King approaches. Adr. Give notice then to Merope. [Exit Phalantus. Re-enter Phalantus with Merope; at the other door Glycon. Gly. Withdraw. [To Adrastus and Phalantus, who go out. All joy to Meropeâthe House of Mourning Shall change its chear; for I, the messenger And author of your happinessâ Mer. Of mine? Gly. Pronounce you once again Messene's Queen; Choice of my heart, and partner of my pow'r. My vow of Sacrifice on this occasion Made to the genial powers, is just perform'd; And nowâ Mer. Another sacrifice remains; And must, ere we can wed, be made by Me. Gly. Name it. Mer. My truthâmy everlasting love Due to the Manes of my murder'd Lordâ A Hecatomb of vows, whose breach would sink me To Hell and Theeâmy yet unblemish'd honourâ My shame, and my revengeâI would have added My peace of mind; but That, long since destroy'd With my Cresfontes, is not mine to offer: None but the wretched peace which mourners find; The doleful privilege to vent my sorrows. Gly. Behold the frantic pleasure of a woman, Divorc'd from comfort, and indulging pain! Mer. Behold the monument of wrath divine, A lightning-blasted cedar! and regard An awful ruin fenc'd from violation. Gly. Is grief a treasure, that you fix your eye On dark tempestuous years? Look forward now; And teach me how to please. I am not often So graciously dispos'd. Mer. Recall the time When joy and I were oneâthat interval Mark'd by Cresfontes, and my kinder fate. Gly. The past, whate'er it is, since past so long, Is best forgotten: For the hours of joy, And years of sorrow, give distaste alike To distant memory. Our nearer view Is entertain'd, or shock'd, as it encounters The beauteous palace, or the shapeless heap: As we retire, the pleasure and disgust Sink by degrees; till in one gloomy mist Distinction disappears. Mer. No moreâtormentor. Gly. Dash not the present good by peevish visions Of past offence: He ne'er will slake his thirst, Who fondly tarries till the flood runs pureâ Approach it as it is; and wisely drink Of royal love and bounty. Mer. Lead me first Where I may drink of Lethe's stream, in deep Oblivion of my wrongs, a draught as large As thou hast quaff'd of blood, thy kindred-blood, Drawn from my husband's and my childrens veins. Gly. Why dwell you on remembrances like these, Forgetful of the clemency, by which You live to taunt me thus? Mer. Behold, ye Gods! Behold and wonder at a tyrant's bounty! Not giving death, with him, is giving life. Gly. Think on your third, and still surviving, son, Sav'd by myâ Mer. HoldâI beg thee holdâO spare me That thought, or madness will pursue it. Gly. Why? Mer. No questionsâname him not. Gly. Whate'er was done, My tempter, Greatness, justifies it all. Useful and lawful, heavily distinguish'd By pedant moralists, are still the same. For if it were unjust to reign, and shake Dependence off, the yoke of hero souls; If wit and valour were deny'd by Jove On these occasions to exert their force, In vain he would bestow these gifts upon us. Mer. Barbarian sentiments! but we appeal; My husband's Ghost appeals aloud, from Jove By second causes governing below, To Jove in his superior court above, And his assessor Truth. Gly. Your loss I mourn; And offer to repair; a husband now; In time a father, to secure succession, And prop my drooping age. Mer. An aged tyrant! Who e'er beheld the prodigy? Display The rack and wheel before my eyesâlet tortures Wear me to death; and Merope shall smile. But thy detested interest, misnam'd Thy love, has forg'd an image to distract me With trembling horrorâWhat? partake the stain That sticks upon thy blood-polluted hand, By joining it with mine? Shall I embrace My husband's murd'rerâshall this bosom warm The serpent, whose infernal sting destroy'd My helpless infants, as they begg'd in vain For life with lifted hands, and suppliant eyes? The thoughtâthe mention, like an ague, shakes My shudd'ring frame, and chills my inmost soul. Gly. Resume your reason, Merope, and with it Messene's Crown. Mer. A bribe not worth my answer. But could you stretch your universal sway Wide as your infamyâwere crowns as plenteous, As curses on your head, I might vouchsafe To tell you then, that all the sun surveys, Weigh'd with the plague of being yours, would prove A dowry far too poor. [Exit Merope. Gly. How dares the Traitress Dispute my pleasure? She may find too soon, That, scorning mine, she makes the grave her bed. [Exit. SCENE changes to a Prison. Egistus sitting, and leaning on a Table. Egis. Is this my lodging then, a dungeon damp [Rising With chilling vapours? And this floor my bed? O! how unlike my pastoral retreat In Tempe's shady vale, beneath a sky Serene and bright! where nature's various hand Arrays the mead; and vernal gales, that breathe The virgin odours of the Year, combine In balmy whispers with the murmuring stream, And feather'd choir, to lull the soul to rest. But oh, the heavenly maid I saw to day, Would She return to charm my longing eyes, This gloomy prison would outshine the morn Enrich'd with purple lightâthe birds of spring Would lose their music, and the flow'rs their sweets. Ye Gods! that form, still present to my mind, Deludes my eyes, or they behold her now. Enter Timoclea, and Keeper. Keep. This is the room; but do not stay too long For fear of accidents. I take my leave. [Exit Keeper. Tim. 'Tis He. Assist me, sex, this once to sound [Aside. His inclinations, and conceal my own, How fares it, stranger? I bewail your lot. Yours are not limbs for fetters to embrace. What pity is it so severe a blast Should nip so fair a bloom! Egis. The words you utter, Sweet as the balm upon the lips that breathe 'em, Have power to reconcile me to my chains: And fortune's anger, more than half appeas'd, Has dropp'd its terrors in a lover's frown. Tim. But if the consequence of this restraint (As much I fear) should reach your forfeit life, How would the tidings of a loss so dear Shock your surviving friends! your mother's cries Ring in my earsâyour father's silent anguish Pains me yet moreâbut, what alarms me most, The mistress of your vows will wring her hands, And tear her locks, and curse perhaps herself, Who threw the veil of coldness or disdain Before a love she then may own too late. In vain her eyes may flow when yours are clos'd; In vain her shrill, repeated shrieks may pierce The hardest hearts, when yours shall beat no more. Egis. You start a thought of exquisite distress. O never let the fair my soul adores, Become so wretched as to curse herself! A tear from each of those subduing eyes Exceeds my hope, and would o'er-pay my death. Tim. To shun a fate so hard, and live for her, Try to escape. 'Tis death to stay. Egis. No matter; Since You, my better genius, have assum'd The most inchanting form on earth to warn me; You that can banish fear, and soften pain, All but the pain you give. You mention'd death: Where is it, heav'nly excellence? The tyrant, Though still indulgent to his thirst of blood, Begins (I hear) to cool, and means to spare me. Tim. Alas! you know not of a blacker storm That threatens hourly from another point. Egis. From whence? O tell me. Tim. Will you then be secret? Egis. Secret as nature in the kindly birth Of passion stealing on my heedless heart; When, wond'ring why it ak'd, and whence it heav'd With unaccustom'd sighs, I look'd within, And found your image there. Tim. Is then my pity Misconstrued love, that your presuming passion, Forgetful of your poverty and chains, Affronts Timoclea's ear? Egis. I own the justice, That gives me death in that resenting frown! But oh! you wrong yourself and me, to think A vain belief of winning You disclos'd My too aspiring love. Let vulgar charms Allure us to Desire where hope supports it: Your eyes have lightning to transfix the soul, Though we can only gaze, and he'er must reach The Heav'n from whence it broke. Tim. Methinks your flame, Unfed by hope, had been more wisely smother'd. Egis. 'Tis base to harbour thoughts we dare not own Tim. Alas! my thoughts deserve a worse reproach: I dare not own them, and I cannot hide. [Aside. Egis. You warn'd me of a storm: 'Tis welcome now; Prepar'd by your disdain: Ay, that's the sting Of death, already fix'd and tort'ring here. But by the cruel joys, denied to Me, That wait to crown your more auspicious love, O pardon mineâpardon the dear offenc Which I must still repeatâit is become Part of my being nowâthe vestal fire, Nurs'd by chaste breath, and kindled from above, Can only burn as pure, and last as long. Enter Adrastus, with Guards. Adr. I little thought to meet a rival here. Confine him closer. [To the Guards. Egis. Villains, off. I follow; Indiff'rent where I go. Debarr'd the light Of those fair eyes, I were a captive still; A dungeon slave, though plac'd on Glycon's throne. [Exit Egistus guarded. Adr. Forgive my duty to the state, that thus Has interrupted the devotion paid you By your Adonis, that illustrious youth Of high descent, your favourite adorer. Tim. 'Tis well when favourites are known, that others May stand aloof, and give their betters way. Adr. Right! I'll attend him to Timoclea's door At shame-fac'd distance; bow, and take my leave. Tim. Now you are kind: I know you will not fail me: Adrastus never breaks his word with women. Adr. You bear it bravely. Can you fly from Me To beggary and shame? A son of earth? A vagrant outcast of no note, besides The double brand of robbery and murder? Tim. Your malice might with equal truth have added Your own dear features, perjur'd and ingrate, To make the picture you have drawn complete. Adr. The baseness of your choice will quickly sour me To hatred and disdain. Tim. I am in both Beforehand with you. Noâyou hate me now Implacablyâ'tis naturalâI know you For what you are: And therefore you must hate me. Adr. Has what I am a name? Tim. It has; a foul one: I leave Ismene to bestow it on you. Adr. If she was slighted for the sake of you, Thank me for asking, where I might compel you, Back'd as I am by sov'reign power. Tim. Compel me! Adr. No; I am not so desperately fond, Howe'er I flatter'd once. Adieuâyour scoffs Return'd in vengeance on your minion's headâ Tim. Whatever fate attends the stranger, mark me, The same shall soon be mine: For know, Timoclea Can die for Him, and will not live for You. Adr. Revenge! I laugh at female threats! Revenge! [Exit Adrastus. Tim. What can be done to save him now, unwarn'd Of the first danger, and expos'd to new From rival rage? but oh the Pow'rs, propitious To chaste Desire and Innocence, defend That precious life. Yet, come the worst that can, His heart is mineâHope dawns in that reflection, And healing joy. As when the traveller, Who prints with weary feet the burning sands Of parch'd Arabia, halts a while, and turns His panting bosom to its fragrant gales; Their spicy breath his harrass'd limbs renews; And, Nature thus refresh'd, the chearless road pursues. [Exit. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A Terrace Walk. Enter at one door Glycon and Nicanor, at the other Phalantus. Phalantus. Hail, happy King! and now a King indeed. Cleander was the Youth that bled to-day; Plung'd in Pamisus by the Robber's arm, Your hated rival feasts its watry race. Gly. Whence this account? or have we dreamt so long That we believe our wishes? Pha. The discovery Was made by Merope; for so reports One in her family; a prying slave Retain'd by me to bring intelligence, The secret, bury'd in uncommon silence For three Olympiads past, her rage betrays; Like some stupendous Earthquake, that reveals The bottom of the Deep. Nic. Behold the fruit Of soul Imposture, that recoils to crush Her working head with unforeseen distress. Gly. But can your easy faith repose on Her, Who has not blush'd to falsify so long? Pha. I credit not her Words, I do her Tears. The slave beheld her as she tore her hairâ Restrain'd from stabbing her swoln heart, she sobb'dâ Lamentedâscream'dâand rang'd with fury o'er Each room, invoking her lost Son by name. Gly. How learn'd she this? Pha. That Circumstance, my Lord, Escap'd the servant's search, but he assures me, The fact is past dispute. Nic. It must be so, From Merope's disorder, when you nam'd Her Son as still alive. Gly. I wonder'd then; But wonder doubly now, she should so well Conceal the cause. Pha. Auspicious Prince, the darling Of Fortune, that performs your soul's desire By other hands, and saves your own the blame! Nic. Conclude the People's hopes quite lost; not one Messenian, form'd for hardy daring, left. Gly. Yes; one more dreadful far than Numbers arm'd; That inmate Foeâthat fury Queenâthat Woman, By Sex implacable. Nic. The public spirit Must needs be stagger'd by so home a blowâ Pursue th'advantage, and it falls for ever. Nor let the Mother, now the Son is dead, Disturb your rest; but treat her as you please. Her Fondling, newly slain in contradiction To what she publish'd of his dying young, Destroys her credit with the Populace; And makes Truth Scandal, when her spleen shall vent it In prejudice to You. But, Sir, resolve To solemnize Cleander's Funeral With utmost speed; with counterfeited grief And honourable pomp; at once to shew Your heart is chang'd, and publish an event Propitious to your future reign. Gly. Agreed. And since Messene will be cheated, let her. When once the People's minds are half-asleep, The arts of Government may come in play, And aid my purpose well. The brave and honest, Remov'd by methods indirect, shall leave Free room for soft effeminate arts, let loose, To pall the spirit, and unbend the mind To tame luxurious lethargy. The croud Shall gape at shews and sports; while, sunk in sloth, My titled slaves build palaces to sleep in; Like Egypt's royal dust in pyramids, The Mummies of deceas'd Nobility. A shew of mercy shall embolden crimes; Reward the wicked, and expose the good. Laws shall be multiply'd; and edicts swarm; And serve the crown alike, obey'd or broke. Alarms of war abroad shall minister. Occasion to their fears; and those to Me A specious handle to lay load upon 'em, And kindly introduce a foreign force. Enter Adrastus. Adr. The queen is coming to implore your grace. Gly. Know you for what? Nic. Whate'er it is, I'm pleas'd That she can make advances: Your compliance May lead the way to hers. Gly. Or, should it not, Slaves have no choice. She may comply; She must. Adr. Heav'ns, what a monster am I curs'd to serve! [Aside. Will justice never more ascend the throne? Gly. Her pride already has refus'd me once: And 'tis beneath the dignity of Glycon, To ask a second time. But see, she comes. Enter Merope and Argaleon. Mer. O Glycon, wonder at a queen's distress! [Kneels. For you may wonder, though you cannot pity. Behold the most forlorn of human kind, Reduc'd to kneel, and to implore a favour From you, the bitter bane of me and mine. Gly. For once be silent, and forget your sorrows. [Raises her. Mer. I may be silent, but forget I cannot. Gly. You must; for as the destinies have doom'd Your sex's softer mould to undergo The test of adverse fate's refining firesâ Mer. I'll stand it to the last. If lagging now So near the glorious goal, I durst defraud The female world of Merope's example; It were a robbery no less than his Who slew my husband, and usurps his throne. Gly. Forget the dead, and prize the living husband; For love forbids delayâthe precious hours Already wasted call for hasteâThis night Joins us for ever. Mer. How? just heav'n forbid it! Gly. If not; your faithful, old, belov'd, adherents, (I know 'em to a man) dragg'd one by one, And mangled on the wheel, shall bleed before me. Mer. O unexampled cruelty! Gly. 'Tis none. They, who reject the good, should bear the ill. Mer. The good you offer, is the worst of ills. Gly. To your perverseness. A distemper'd fancy Turns joy to grief. Mer. Can joy be nam'd with wedlock, When all I see, and all I hear, is death? Gly. I bring you honour and delight: Your sex Is known to covet both. Mer. I covet death Much other. Gly. Were it but a name, you might. Mer. What is it more to virtue? Gly. If you boast Of virtue, prove it by obedience now; Nor madly struggle with the Fate's decree. Mer. Forbear to press me on that hateful subject; But grant, O grant my first and last request. You have a captive who has robb'd and murder'd: Make me the mistress of his life or death. Gly. You hear the Queen, Adrastus: let her orders Relating to the pris'ner be obey'd. Her sex's tenderness would spare the youth. [Exit Adrastus. Mer. Can blood be pardon'd? Gly. So I understood you. Had the deceas'd indeed been your Cleanderâ But that's impossibleâfor Merope, (You must have heard of Merope, renown'd For rigid steady truth) ev'n she has told me, Cleander in his infancy expir'd Within his mother's arms. Mer. Ah, tyrant! now You mock me, and pull off the mask, in hope To see grief end me on the spot! But know, Forlorn insulted Merope shall live For lov'd revenge, her sole remaining joy: Her fears are gone with him for whom she fear'd. Yes, traitor, rending thus my hairâmy garmentsâ And howling through the streets, I'll rouse Messene To justice worthy me! Gly. You dream! you rave! Mer. If that suspicious head was still alarm'd With apprehensions for the crown it wore, And being born within a sceptre's view, Was such a monstrous crime; you might have doom'd The dear offender to some close retreat; Condemn'd in fields to earn his scanty food, And share the running stream with grazing flocks, His low unenvy'd charge. Too happy I, Had he but liv'd! I had despis'd a kingdom! Ah! keep your kingdom, and restore my son. Gly. Cease, Merope, to weep: Our joyful 'spousals Shall soon repair the loss you now lament, And bury sorrow in forgetfulness. [Exeunt Glycon, Nicanor, and Phalantus. Mer. In everlasting dark forgetfulness I know to bury it. Our joyful 'spousals! O for a brand, ye unrelenting powers, To set the temple in a blaze around him! The hand that bears it, bears my bridal torch. Those nuptials, Glycon, and those flames, would bless me; For I would perish too, content and glad So to be join'd to thee. Arg. Alas, my Queen! Heav'n guard your life: May no misfortune drive, But nature lead, you off the stage. Mer. No more. Long as they can, let cowards live; but I Have liv'd already longer than I ought: And so have you, and each Messenian slave, Who owns a dagger, and yet fears to strike it Home to the tyrant's heart, or to his own. Arg. O Madam, calm your rage, and recollect That fate has made the pris'ner yours. The tyrant In all his ways is violent, but various; And may resume his grant. Mer. I therefore form'd My scheme before I ask'd; and must prevent, What you imagine, by dispatch. Enter Ismene. Ismene, Are my commands perform'd? Ism. Alas! I come To tell my Queen they are! Mer. 'Tis well. Forbear. [To Ismene who offers to follow her. The work that now remains, is all my own. [Exit Merope. Arg. Her forehead wears a storm, that soon will break In thunder on the captive's head. You droop. Ism. Have I not reason, Sir? my sorrows wait On those of Merope. Arg. And mine on yours: Those sorrows of your own that shun the light, And prey in silence on your tender bloom. A stubborn sadness clouds my daughter's brow With all the symptoms of despairing love. 'Tis so; or whence was that delib'rate blush That paus'd a while on my last words, and then O'erflow'd your kindling cheeks, and vary'd there The settled pale with momentary red? Ism. I cannot speak; or if I couldâ Arg. Proceedâ If you could speak, you would accuse Adrastus. But now, alas! you need not: He himself Has sav'd your pains; and trust a father's care To try all means that may renew his love. Ism. No; though it prov'd, what now it ne'er can prove, Sincere as once I thought it. Arg. How it glads me To find you thus indifferent! Ism. Alas! Would I could find it so! [Weeps. Arg. In tears! ay now They stream apace, and claim another flood; A flood of vengeance from the traitor's heart. Ism. What means my father? Arg. To obey the summons Of natureâjusticeâhonourâand revenge Ismene's wrongs on her undoer's head. Ism. O rather say, on mine. Arg. Alas! my child, You love him still. Ism. To my eternal shame. Arg. If so, be calm, and listen. My resentment Against Adrastus was but feign'd to try you; And probe a wound which I have now discover'd Within the compass of my art to heal. Ism. You say he has accus'd himself. Arg. He has, In terms so warm, you may assure your heart There never was a Penitent like him. He blush'd, Ismene, as you blush'd but now; He wept as now you weepâreproach'd the tyrantâ His Fatherâand himselfâHis Blood (he told me) Should expiate his offence, without forgiveness; Which yet he durst not ask of wrong'd Ismene; Unless her Father interpos'd to gain it, Mov'd by the vows of his repenting love. Ism. If this be true.â Enter Euryalus. Eur. The good old Polydorus, [Apart to Argaleon. Spent with his weary stage, is just arriv'd. Arg. Adieu my Child, and take this comfort with thee.â The Shrub may flourish, tho' the Cedar falls; And if the ruin of the royal house Involves not You, the man you love is Yours. [Exeunt severally. SCENE Merope's Apartment. A Table with a Bowl upon it. Enter Merope, and Keeper at the other door. Keep. The Captive in my charge, by your command, Attends without. Mer. Conduct him in, and leave us. [Exit Keeper. What means this change? a horror, as at sight Of one, my opposite by nature, chills me. Ay, there's the Murd'rerâNow, ye righteous Powers, Speed your own work. Enter Egistus, with the Keeper, who goes out. Egis. Can Excellence like yours Vouchsafe to shine upon a wretch like Me? Mer. Did ever daring villainy usurp A form so fair? Avenging Jove has plac'd you Within my pow'r. A band of chosen friends, Arm'd and resolv'd, are ready at my call. You cannot flyâand to resist were vain. Egis. Whom should the guiltless sly? when heav'nly Powers Descend on earth, 'tis seldom to destroy. A secret rev'rence, free from slavish fear, Bends me to your commandâMethinks you claim My soul's obedience by a Mother's right. Mer. A Mother's right! profane that name no more. 'Tis sacred to unutterable grief. I was a Mother once. Egis. Alas! for pity That still you are not so! Mer. The Youth I mourn Was all desire could frame; and Heav'n had spar'd None of my Sons but himâthe last of threeâ The rest were murder'd tooâand all their blood I charge on Glycon, that inhuman source Of misery to Me. Egis. Ten thousand curses Light on his headâbut can I only curse? O! that a Wish could give me liberty, And let my vengeance loose against the Tyrant, Fenc'd by his Guards in vain! Mer. Dissembling Traitor! Dream'st thou to fool me thus? My vow'd revenge May reach the tyrant; but begins with thee. Egis. What have I done? But be it as it may; Life is no more than lentâand, dying young, I only pay before-hand. Mer. So compos'd! The harden'd wretch! [Aside.] But is not Death a prospect Of Terror? Egis. Yes; to Cowardice and Guilt. Mer. Yet you would wish to live? Deny me that; And my revenge is lost. Egis. You need not ask. The same high spirit and superior sense Shine in the Scorn of death, and Taste of life. Mer. Then prove thy Scorn of death, and drink it there. [Pointing to the Bowl. Egis. What! like a savage beast, inclos'd in toils, To perish thus, and not to know the cause? Mer. How came the tyrant to discover him? And whence was You inform'd to find him out? Dissemble not. 'Tis all in vain. Egis. Some strange Mistake transports youâpray be calm a momentâ I apprehend you not. Mer. Alas! not you! You are a stranger to the King! Egis. I was, Ere I beheld him first to-day: Too well I know him now; the Minister of Death: Nor was it more than what my heart foretold, When he pronounc'd my doom. But do I dream? Can it be authoriz'd by You? Mer. At least You was instructed to amuse a Woman With that fictitious doom; too gross a blind To balk occasion that may ne'er return, And lull Revenge asleep. Egis. Still more mysterious! Mer. If not suborn'd by Glycon, what could tempt you To slay the Guiltless? Did those hands deserve To lop a branch from Hercules, prepar'd To stretch a Royal shade, and shelter Nations? What said my Child? Repeat his dying words. Did he not call on Merope? Egis. Amazing! Mer. Why tremble thus my hands? Thou filial shade, [Taking up the Bowl. Dear! precious! wretched! but at length reveng'd! Accept this off'ringâhere. [Giving it to Egistus. Enter Timoclea. Tim. Ah! stranger, stay; Or drink but half; and leave the rest for Me. Mer. Ha! who presumes to traverse my revenge? Timoclea? but dispatch. Egis. I would obey; And, sure of death, should chuse it here, to mock The Tyrant's malice, and the Headsman's stroke. Nor can the grizly king of shadows plant One terror here to shake me. But the life In which She claims an interest, is now No longer mine, but hers. Tim. O! spare himâspare himâ And lay the blame on Fate alone. Mer. I would, In any cause but this. Be witness, Heaven, I punish not by choice. Tim. Then hear at least His just defence. Mer. Of my Cleander's murder? Egis. 'Twas to preserve myself. Tim. Mark that, and save him. Fear not to justify the truth. [To Egistus. A Father, Endanger'd as the pris'ner was, might slay His only Son unknownâPerhaps the Prince Was faulty. Mer. How? Tim. I only said, perhaps. Nay, speak. [To Egistus. All children are not like their parents: Was he exempt from blame; and kind and good, Because my Queen is so? for so the world Has ever found you hitherto. And shall Timoclea be the first to want the pity That foes have bless'd in You? O plead at least My cause; for yours is mine. [To Egistus. Egis. Dear Sov'reign sounds, My counter-poison! I have heard enough To triumph now in death. Mer. Ye Gods, who grant me The pow'r of just revenge, forgive my slackness In dallying with your Attribute. Off, traitress! Ah! dear Cleander, whose dishonour'd ghost Turns paler yet, to find his destin'd Bride (For so the fondness of my soul design'd her) Doat on his Murderer! Tim. O! pardon both; [Kneeling. (For both have err'd unwillingly) his hand, And poor Timoclea's heart. Be merciful To this my first offenceâmy Queenâmy Motherâ For you have call'd me Child; and in return My Father still has lov'd the Prince as his: Alas! his soul's distress will equal yours For your Cleander's death: And will you heap More sorrows on his aged head by mine? Egis. By yours? Good Heav'n forbid! Tim. Most sure, by mine; And 'tis but just. Am I th'occasion? Curse On this untutor'd tongueâAlas! you know notâ I knew not thenâbut IâO Murder! I Have rais'd the storm that wrecks you nowâand have I. But one poor life to offer? Mercy! mercy! Egis. O! spare the breath that from love's Altar here Exhales like Incense. Sure, if tears more precious Than Eastern gems could ransom me, the price Is over-paid by You. Mer. Once more, obey me. [Pointing to the Bowl. Tim. O, hold! [To Egistus.] Consider for an hour. [To Merope. Mer. Away. Tim. Nay, let it be but one poor minute more. The Gods, who know his innocence, may work Some unexpected miracle to save him. Mer. They may. Why do I loiter then? To-night [Pulling out a Dagger. This Dagger ends me: There' a revenge for thee. But mark me wellâfor nowâjust nowâ [Approaching Timoclea. Tim. Ah! spare me. Mer. I stab thy image in her heart, if thou Delay'st a moment. Drink, or see her die. Egis. Your vengeance is aton'dâTimoclea safeâ [Drinking hastily. Her Lover happy. Tim. Cursed act! revenge it Thou master-fiend, Despair! [Weeps. Egis. Restrain your tears: The slave that was, is freed. Mer. For ever freed Prom the just lashes of reproachâThe stings Of conscience shot to thy invenom'd soul: For That was tainted first, and drew the poison From its congenial hell. Egis. A weight like death Hangs at my heart; and Nature sinks apace. Mer. It mustâthy lawless sword could hardly pierce My dear Cleander's heart with surer speed Than will the vengeful bane make way to thine. Tim. Alas! I read it in his alter'd hueâ His livid lipsâdim eyesâand faded cheeksâ Paleâghastly paleâand now convulsions rend The lab'ring strings of life, and tear Timoclea From that devoted heart, so true to love; My fatal love, its first, its deadliest poison. [Faints. Mer. Help thereâWho waits? convey her hence. Enter Attendants, who carry her off. Egis. Farewel, Timoclea, and the lightâThe shades of death O'ercast my swimming eyesâNowânow I'm goingâ O Polydorus! [Sinks into the Chair. Mer. Polydorus, said you? Egis. My cruel fate at least was kind by halves, To bring me here alone; else You perhaps Had suffer'd with me. Mer. Ha! your Name? your Country? Alas! I parly with the Dead. And ohâ But is it not a dream? methought he call'd On PolydorusâNay, his dying look Was just my Lord'sâbut stay, how looks he now? [Views the Body, and turns away. I cannot bear the sight; my coward sex Swells to my eyes, and sickens at destruction. Yet this is he who slew my SonâI'm sure Timoclea told me soâShe should be hereâ Where is she? gone, like those deluding fires That far from help mislead thro' faithless moors The night-bewilder'd wretch, then disappear. Enter Argaleon. Arg. Joy to the Queen! the Stranger slain to-day, Whom you believ'd your Son, is cast ashore; And proves a Robber, own'd with mingled dread And joy, by many, whom his felon hand Had stript and wounded. Mer. Holdâart thou Argaleon? Spare, pr'ythee, spare me, if thou art. Did I Destroy thy Brother? am I Glycon? say, Wherein has Merope offended thee, That thou shouldst rack her thus? My Child not murder'd This morning at the bridge? He was, he was. That Image, horrid as it is, was joy To this soul-rending fear that I haveâwhat? O! 'tis not to be borne. Look there. Arg. The Captive, Pale! breathless! dead! Mer. He is. Arg. And kill'd by You? Mer. Why not, thou stern Inquisitor for blood? [Trembling. Arg. I dare not speak my doubts; but Polydorus Will come and end 'em soon. Mer. Is he arriv'd? Arg. He is; and hast'ning, fast as age will let him, To pay his duty here. Mer. Runâflyâforbid himâ Hide me from him, and from my selfâbut stay; Let Polydorus come to view the dead, And worse than kill the living. Enter Arbantes and Polydorus. Arb. Gracious Queen, I bring your faithful servant, Polydorus. [Polyd. kneels. Mer. Why came Ile not before? No ceremony: Rise, Polydorus. But my Son, where is he? Pol. O! Heav'n! my Prince! my Darling! my Cleander? [Viewing the Body. Mer. Did you not name my Child? Pol. Alas! I did; But never thought to find him here, and dead. Mer. Eternal Palsy shake thy tongueâmy Son Dead by my hand! Arb. Help!âcall for help, Argaleon, To bear her hence, and to remove the body, A sight too shocking for a Mother's eyes. [Exit Argaleon. Pol. O! let me render my last service here; With trembling arms embrace his dear remains; Weep my farewel, and sob my soul away. Mer. Is this my wedding-night? or must I wait? Where is the Priest? the Sacrifice is readyâ And hark! the Raven screams our nuptial song. Yes, Glycon; thou hast gallantly deserv'd me, By giving up the murderer to death: For there he stands! just there! the Murderer? Ye Pow'rs defend me! 'tis my Child, Arbantes: Ah! how disfigur'd! good my friend, entreat himâ Will you not speak in my behalf? alas! I dare notâHa! he frowns! Kneel with me, kneelâ Mark how he frownsânay, now you have delay'd, Re-enter Argaleon with Attendants, who carry off the Body. Till he is gone again. Arb. Alas! she raves. Why will they loiter thus? Mer. Strange news, Arbantes! The Son of poor Thyestes slain! To-night He feasts upon him; and has summon'd me To grace the Banquet with that bowl. Enter Women Attendants. Stand off. Ye will not force me to the Tyrant's bed! My Lord! Cresfontes, help! he has surpris'd me; And hurries me awayâhelpâMurderâhelp. [They lead her off. Arb. Was ever night like this? O dire event! Arg. Distress unparallel'd by ages past! Pol. Split on a rock, we sink in view of land: Our lights extinguish'd speak our wreck at hand. [Exeunt. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The outward part of the Temple. Enter Glycon, Nicanor, and Phalantus. Glycon. Prodigious! can it be? Pha. 'Tis certain truth. Gly. There was indeed (for now I recollect) A dark antipathy, I knew not whence, Between the wretch and me. But has she slain Her Son? her Darling? torn her bowels from her With speed preventing mine? why this excels The clinging shirt our great forefather tugg'd In vain, to rend from his invenom'd limbs, On Oeta's flaming brow; 'tis delicacy Of mischief heighten'd to the gust of hateâ The Stretchâthe Masterpieceâthe lucky Hit Of glorious ruin. Nic. Mark the timing too Of this important Stroke; and thank the Gods For turning on your Adversary's head The fate that threaten'd yours. Gly. The Gods, Nicanor? What! thou a Statesman? and whine thus? 'Tis false, My Spiritâmy Addressâmy Geniusâthese, And only these, are Deities to Me. By their resistless force, that buoy'd me up From private life, I scal'd Messene's Throne, Borne on a tide of blood; and, in despite Of Heav'n and Earth combin'd, sit fast upon it, Since all who had a claim are dust and ashes. But you surmise Cleander's death has sav'd me From some impending blow. Nic. And unsuspected (It seems) by You: A proof, my lord, that danger Lurks on the borders of security: For his arrival here points out to Me Some deep design, just ripe for execution. Pha. Add the return of Polydorus. Nic. True. That old sagacious hound could ne'er resolve To head the pack, but that the scent assur'd him The chace was near an end. Gly. And to reward Those expectations, let the Hangman hoist That opener of seditious lyes aloft To dance in every blast; and that way taint His native air. Nic. A righteous sentence. Gly. Hark! [Trumpets. Pha. The Temple's gilded roof rebounds the summons Of trumpets, wafted by the winds, perfum'd With aromatic sweets, and various flowers That hide the Jasper pavement. Gly. Hark again. [Shouts. The Music now is drown'd in louder shouts Of thousands, crouding to behold the pomp Of our approaching Nuptials. Ask within, [To Phalantus, who goes out. If all is ready; for the midnight hour, That yields her to my arms, is nigh. I laugh At my late Consort's prophecy: But yet It rises uppermost to-night, and damps The gay ideas of my promis'd joy; While still my eyes, turn'd thitherward unbid, Dwell on her tomb, as I had bus'ness there. Nic. You say, my Lord, your Consort prophecy'd. Gly. Yes, on the verge of death, that gives a prospect (As fools imagine) to departing souls, Of future truths and undiscover'd worlds, She lock'd her dying hand in mine, and cry'd; The joy, with which I quit our barren bed, Would still be greater, were a worthier bride To fill the room I now resign for ever. But oh! that golden fruit, though full in view, And ready for the gath'ring hand, shall 'scape you; For you mustâthere her language fail'dâshe grasp'd me Once more then groan'd her anxious soul away. Re-enter Phalantus. Pha. Pale as the robe he wears, the startled Priest Begs you, my Lord, to drop, at least defer Your purpos'd marriage; for the Gods forbid it By inauspicious signs of dire presage. The slaughter'd victim had but newly stain'd The blazing Altar, when a gust of wind Impetuous blew it off, and quite extinguish'd The consecrated fire. Nay more, there sprung A silver right from King Cresfontes' tomb; Along the temple thro' the western door It shot; and, spreading as it rose, has fix'd Above the Palace in a radiant Round. Nic. These are portents indeed! Gly. Effects of chance; Or rather the caprice and wantonness Of Nature, sporting with the coward's fears. Where is the Queen? Pha. My Lord, I left within Some of her friends; and others now advance This way; which makes me guess, that she herself Will not be long behind. Gly. 'Tis well! the Gods (You say) were angry when we offer'd last. But if she warps or loiters now, I mean To reconcile 'em with a sacrifice More worthy Them and Me. Lead to the Altar. [Exeunt. Enter Polydorus and Arbantes. Pol. How fares the Queen? Arb. The Summons, that requires Her presence here to tie the Nuptial knot, Found her resign'd to Glycon's will: Her sleep, However short and broken, has recall'd Her wand'ring reason to a sense of pain; Which yet she treats with patience now, like one Resolv'd to end it soon. Pol. Too soon she cannot. Life were a torment now, beyond the malice Of her worst foes to wish her. Cruel Powers! Is this the wretched end of all my watchings, My pains, my hazards, for the dear Cleander? Why was his Infancy your guardian care? And Hope prolong'd till now? The dismal day, Big with destruction, when his Father fell, And both his Brothers, should have ended Him: These tears had mingled then with those that swell'd The purple deluge of Imperial blood, Lost in a sea of undistinguish'd grief. Arb. Peace, Polydorus, and submit to Fate. Pol. Was it for this I form'd his matchless youth To gentle manners, and to glorious toil? To tempt the fury of the foaming Boar? Or cross the Tyrant of CythÃ¦ron's shade, Some famish'd Lion in his chace of prey? The foaming Boar and famish'd Lion spar'd him, Preserv'd from them to perish by a Mother. Arb. Be hush'd. She comes. Enter Merope, veiled and in Mourning, led by Timoclea and Ismene. Ism. Observe that Shout, Timoclea. [Shout. Another yet; and nearer than the first. [Shout again, Tim. Almighty Jove, as thou art worship'd here, Let Justice, thy lov'd Attribute, prevail, And doubly consecrate thy hallow'd shrine. Enter Euryalus. Eur. Hail to the Queen! those loud-repeated Shouts Proclaim'd the Tyrant's fallâhis dying groans Rejoice my earâI saw him stretch'd along, And gasping on the floor. Mer. Timoclea's prayer Is answer'd nowâmy Husband's ghost appeas'dâ The two first pledges of our love reveng'dâ 'Tis true, Cleander, still thy Murderer lives; But thusâ [Draws a dagger, and offers to stab herself. Euryalus and Argaleon wrest it from her. Eur. O! stay your hand, and hear me out. You are no Murdererâyour Cleander livesâ He slew the Tyrant; and the general voice Ev'n now salutes him King. [Shouts of Cleander. Mer. Impossible! Why am I thus deceiv'd? Ism. You are notâI Deceiv'd you. When employ'd to fetch the draught Design'd against your Son, the secret whispers Of my prophetic tender heart inspir'd me To put the change on your deluded hate. A pow'rful Opiate, in the Poison's room, With sudden influence lock'd his senses fast; And, guiltless of the death your vengeance meant, Produc'd its image, sleep. Mer. Support me, Nature, Beneath this conflictâthis surprizeâ [Faints. Enter Egistus. Egis. Where is she? The pleasure of this glorious night must wait Till I have found her out, and share it with her. Alas! what change is this? Eur. The turn her spirits Have taken, from the news that you are safe, Has robb'd her of her sense. Egis. Let me recall it. The voice of filial piety shall wake her Once more to life, to joy, and me. My Mother! Mer. Where am I? Who are You? Egis. Your Son, Cleander. Mer. My Son Cleander! Yesâyou areâyou areâ [Embracing him. I know you nowâBut joyâconfusionâwonderâ Croud on my soul, and language sinks beneath 'em. I must be mute, and gaze. Egis. How is it with you? Mer. My Life! my Glory! and my dear Defence! Late my Despair and Shame! O let me hide [Embracing him. My Blushes thusâand thusâthe memory Of what has pass'd to-night!â Egis. My dearest Mother! Mer. Forgive your Murderer: Such I meant to be, When e'en my piety had made me impious. Egis. O spare Yourself and Me that thought! Mer. I will: For 'tis a precipice so steep and horrid, I dare not look upon the sea beneath, That roar'd aloud, and threaten'd to o'erwhelm My soul with everlasting guilt. Egis. My Father! [To Polydorus. I wanted leisure for your joy before. I call you Father still; for dear Timoclea, With your consent, bestows herself upon me; A gift more precious than the life she sav'd. Yes, yes, my Mother; my Timoclea gave me The life, Ismene, for her sake, preserv'd. Pol. My utmost wish is now fulfill'd; and death, Come when it will, is welcome. Mer. O Ismene, [Embracing her. Some God inspir'd thee sure to disobey Thy frantic Queen; and guardian aid was thine. Egis. What titles, equal to desert like yours, [To Ismene. Can pay the tribute of our thanks and praise? Pol. But statues crown'd, and obelisks, inscrib'd By public gratitude, shall speak Ismene. Egis. In tenderness to You and Polydorus, We kept ye both in ignorance till now. The short-liv'd joy, to find me still alive, Would but have added to your load of sorrow, Had I miscarry'd in my bold attempt On Glycon's life. Mer. But how that bold attempt So well succeeded, I am yet to learn. Egis. My body, lifeless as it seem'd, was safe Beneath your roof; and when the drousy weight Of that lethargic draught gave way, I wak'd In pleasing wonder to behold Timoclea, Ismene, and my other friends: They told me The secret of my birth, and how the Tyrant Prepar'd to force you to his bed: With that, Determin'd, at one gallant throw, to save Your life, or lose my own, I plac'd myself Close by the altar with my chosen few. At once the Tyrant came; at once my sword Was drawn, and pierc'd his heartâMy friends proclaim'd me Messene's rightful KingâA doubtful murmur Of consternation mix'd with joy ensu'dâ The guards, recover'd from their first surprize; Began to kindle at their master's death; And fierce Phalantus, who inflam'd their rage, A second victim to my justice sell: But odds of number would have over-pow'r'd us, Enter Adrastus and Argaleon. Had not Adrastus here, their leader, check'd The rising storm. Adr. Persuasions, join'd with threats, Have now induc'd my men, by my example, To help the general cry of King Cleander. Arg. Cleander rings along the dome; Cleander, In echoes, from the vaulted roof, returns. Adr. My soul in secret still espous'd your claim; And though, entrusted as I was by Glycon, I never would have drawn my sword against him; Yet when I saw him welt'ring in his blood, And you my lawful Prince appear'd before me; My honour then, by inclination sway'd, Could doubt no longer to complete the work So gloriously begun. Egis. I thank you thus. [Embracing him. The blessings of a people sav'd be yours; And all returns within my pow'r. Adr. If duty Can merit a reward, I beg from You [Bowing to Egistus. My Father's pardon, and my own from Her. [Bowing to Ismene. Egis. Your Father has his lifeâHis ill-got wealth Is forfeited to You. Mer. And for Ismene, If I can guess, she will allow her Queen [Leads Ismene to Adrastus, and joins their hands. To seal your pardon, and to join your hands. Egis. And let those hands, and yours, and mine, and all, Freed from the dire oppressor's chains, be rais'd In grateful homage to the Pow'rs above, A Monarch's Murder, unreveng'd so long, Struck half their vot'ries dumb. The temple shakes Whene'er the palace falls. But, lo! the God! 'Tis Jove himself, in Jove's own house, reveal'd. For Justice, long oppress'd, erects her head: Her hands are iron, though her feet are lead. [Exeunt omnes. The End of the Fifth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. By an unknown Hand. Spoken by Mrs. Buchanan. As a young Virgin, on her wedding-night, Wishes, yet fears to try the dear delight: Hope and mistrust rule her torn breast by turns, And while she chills with fears, with hope she burns. Desire, impatience, fears, and wishes vie; And for the mastery all her passions try. Such is the state our Poet's breast is in, Now he, too late, repents him of his sin. In ev'ry Critic's bridegroom face he spies An eager haste to seize upon the prize. Critics and Poets long, like Man and Wife, Have led a snarling fashionable life. They never meet, but quarrels, noise, and pother, Disturb the house, while one berogues the other. Indeed, friend Critics, you begin too soon; You rate and damn them in their honey-moon: 'Tis you are most to blame. Upon my life You treat a Bride as you would treat a Wife. True English Boobies, resolute you sit here; Tho' ne'er so good, spouse shall not get the better. The Fair to gain, soft methods you should use; Begin like Lovers, gently treat the Muse; Her sweetest treasures she will ne'er refuse. Her coyness dally with, indulge her shame; You'll not extinguish, but preserve her flame. Sparks, you may credit an experienc'd Wife; Win her by softness, and she'll please for life.</field>
