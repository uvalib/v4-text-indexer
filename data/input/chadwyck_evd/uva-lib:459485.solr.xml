      <field name="fulltext">The SCENE Constantinople.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. SCENE. 1. Enter Maria, Cesarissa, and her Nurse. Nur. Chear up, Fair Madam, Let me see you smile; Mar. A Smile's prophanenesse in these doleful Times. Nur. Doleful indeed, and yet with all your Grief They will be nothing better, you much worse. Mar. Ah, Nurse, my weeping doth much ease my minde, âGrief which bleeds not in th'eyes, festers in th'heart. Nur. Some showres of sorrow make the soul to spring With pious thoughts, but you a deluge bring, And drown'd your Senses with your over-grief. Mar. I am a woman, for our Sex 'tis hard To hit the Mean, and if we be denied Of our over-doing, we shall Nothing do Our Love, our Grief, our Hatred, and our Joy. Yea, all our Passions are contrived so, They are not full, or else they overflow. Nur. Have patience Madam, Matters may amend, The Emperour's yet a Child. Mar. And Child in judgement he will ever be. No Monster doth more hate a Looking-Glasse, Then he a Book, his wit's too short to measure A noble sport, or honourable pleasure. Only he sits, and sots, and drinks, and sleeps, The Stewes is brought to him, or he to th'Stews. Nur. Andronicus will shortly here arrive, And by him all things will be rectified. Mar. Well, I could tell you somthing if I durst. Nur. Madam do, If I reveal it, let me be accurst, Sooner the very stones themselves shall speak. Mar. Thats not impossible, In Churches oft I have seen Speaking-stone. Nur. Midnight shall turne a Clack sooner then I. Mar. 'Tis this; I do not think Andronicus Will help us any whit. Nur. Know you the man? Mar. Were all faults lost, in him they might be found. Nur. Here comes Alexius. Mar. Quickly quit the place, He'le say that I shoot poison from mine eyes, 'Cause I presume to tell him of his faults; I'm lov'd the worse for loving him so well. Exeunt. SCENE 2. Alexius the young Emperour, with Asotus his Servant, Philobiblos his Schoolmaster running after him with a Book. Alex. Lets haste, lets haste, the slave runs after us. Asot. His vineger-looks I think would melt the Alps. Phil. Please it your Highnesse, It is but a leafe, And that a little oneâ Alex. Sir, lay by the book. Phil. Apelles said, No day without a line. Asot. There wants a strong one for that neck of thine. Alex. What's Learning to a Prince? O give me Greatnesse. Phil. You can't be great, unlesse you first be learn't. Alex. If I lack Learning, I can borrow it From those my subjects who are better stor'd. Phil. Braines can't be borrowed, nor Learning lent. Alex. Not lend their Braines to me? I'le take their heads. Phil. Apply your self to th'reading Histories. Alex. I'de rather Histories were made of me. Phil. Take heed one be not made too soon of you. This is a precious book call'd Plutarchs Lives; It is no crabbed book with rugged stile. But Wisdom smiles in pleasant Language here. A Mine of hidden Treasure's here contain'd, Which will betray you into it with pleasure. Asot. That very words proclaimes your wickednesse Who bring a Book here to betray your Prince. Phil. Not to betray him unto Vice like you, To spend his dayes in drink, his nights at dice. [Aside. Alex. What hidden Treasure in this Plutarch's found. Phil. Reade the Book over, it will make you wise. Alex. Have you e're read it? Phil. Yes Sir, oft at School. Alex. How comes it then to passe ye're such a fool. Phil. Great Alexander, who did put the yoke On the worlds neck, and Persians Empire won Ne're call'd his Master Aristotle Fool. Alex. He ne're deserved it. Leave this gravity, I like no Library but a well-fill'd Cellar, Where Pipes of Cretian-Wine are Folio's, Butts of Falernion are the Quarto-books. Surreptan-Terses are the Lesser Volumes. Mention no more your Plutarchs Lives to me Except you woo your death, Come lets be gone. Phil. Alas, alas, I can bemoan your fate, For to amend it is, I fear, too late. Exeunt. SCENE 3. Enter Cleobulus and Paleologus. Cleob. O times, O manners! Paleol. At that posture still? You raile so long upon the Times, that now Th'are grown stark deaf, and hear not what you say. Like dwellers near Nile's Cataract, who never Do heare the noise, because they hear it ever. Cleob. When I was young, some sixty Winters since. Paleol. Ah sixty Winters, why not Springs aswell? Cleob. Young men by Springs, by Winters old men count Their passed years, I say when I was young, The world was not so bad as now it is. Paleol. The World was childish, when you were a child, And now you'r old, the World dotes as you dote. Cleob. Gap Greenhead. Paleol. I'le not change it for your gray. Go coine your silver haires up into money, Weare lesse wealth on your Head, more in your purse. Cleob. Scorne not that Age you hope to live unto. Paleol. Old Age I would not wish for, but long life. Cleob. To wish long life, without old Age, is vain. Paleol. But to be serious, what Account can you Give of the world, when you were but a child, Could you write Comments then on the Times Text? Cleob. Something I then observed, and still remember. Paleol. Something you then observ'd, who play'd his part The best at Ball, At th'admirable Art Of whipping of a Top, what Boy excel'd, Till you in Age had counted twice seven years, School was your Hell, a Play-day all your Heaven. Cleob. Yea, I mark't matters of more consequence The innocence and purenesse of those dayes. No cruel Landlords did their Tenants rack, Breaking their Tenants backs to deck their own, Dissembling was unborn, and simple Truth Men with their Tongues did speak, seal'd with their tooth, Now, in this life there's nothing left but lying. Paleol. You'd best make haste to die, and hear the Truth. Cleob. All faults are now in fashion, Sin's a glory, And he who dares be honest in the Court Is mock't at, Flatterers only are advanc't. Paleol. Thus 'twas alwayes, thus 'twill ever be, Till Rhyne to Caspion-Seas payes tribute, and Till Indian-Ganges doth with Nile ingender, As long as Starres shine in their Firmament, As long as Fishes swim in Neptunes Brine, So long at Court will Parasites attend, When they leave off, conclude, the World is done. Cleob. Your words resent of too much Poetry, Not to say falshood. Paleol. Sure of too much Truth, I could most easily assign the Reason, (Convincing Reason) why these Times displease you. Cleob. Let's hear it, I am not yet too old to learn. Paleol. 'Tis parcel of an old mans character To praise times past, 'cause they were best with him. When young, you'd strength &amp; will to revel, ride, Hunt, hawk, and race it, Act in Masks and dance, But since these pleasures are denied by Age, Your only pastime is to chide the times; And 'cause your eyes are dim, you blame the room As dark; and do impute your stumbling and Ill-treading to th'unev'nnesse of a Floor. Cleob. I'le hearken to your fond discourse no more. Paleol. Your sore is rub'd, you wince soâ I see some quarrel with the present time, Meerly because 'tis present. Presence is Counted a crime by some mens restless soules, I'de rather hear the world bemoan'd, then rail'd at, Men should convert (if I might men advise) Their bitter Satyres to sad Elegies. Exeunt. SCENE 4. Enter Monobius the Hermite alone. Mon. Scarce have I crau'ld from out my Mossy Cell On my four legs to view the world abroad, Full sixty yeares and six therein I dwelt, My aime was to do good, and to shun evil, (A solitary man's a Saint or Devil) Oft to my self I have a Question stated Oppos'd, then answer'd, at last moderated, Now scatter'd into three, then sum'd to one, And never lesse alone, then when alone. But now to change my course, I do intend, And by another may gain the same end. Our lives were made for labour, not for ease, To profit others, not our selves to please; Us for our selves our Mothers never bare, Friends and the Common good in us claim share. Discourse us for Society hath fitted. What sin unnatural have mens parts committed, Condemned to be buried thus alive? Our Talents are put out, If not put out, And gifts are deaded, if not dealt about. Nor do I count those men most mortifi'de Which most to solitarie Lives are ti'de, Bad servants, disobedient sons, curst wives, Ill neighbours, cruel masters, faithlesse friends, These Crosses which a Civil life betide, More humbleth hearts, and more abateth pride, Then all mans wilful fasting in a Cell, Which makes some soules with windy pride to swell But oh, my vow, my vow, which I did make, That I alive would not my Cell forsake. Its sad remembrance keeps my soul in awe, This Corosive my very heart would gnaw Did not this salve the sore. Vows rashly spoken, On more mature advice, are justly broken, First, ev'n to make it, was a grievous sin, It would be greater to remain therein. To th'Court I'le go, there all things now are sad, Where one doth seek each other ro out-bad. It hath as many Factions as Lords, Only their strife in wickednesse accords, However there my Councel I'le dispence, And for successe relie on Providence. SCENE 5. Enter Xena the Mother-Empresse, with three Ladies, Eudoxa, Irene, and Artemia waiting on her with a Lutanist. Xen. Come lets be merry, Ladies, Sirrah sings, SONG. Lad. Since that our life's so very short, All is lost that is not sport, Revenge your selves of envious death, And with the Swans sing out your breath, What the life you lead on earth Doth want in length, take out in mirth. [Monobius runs to him, and casually breaks his Lute] Lad. My harmlesse Lute! wherein hath it offended, That this my musick scarce begun, is ended? Eud. This is Monobius, that over-grown Saint, With his prodigious holinesse. Bold Bedlam How dare you thus my Musick interrupt? Mon. I bring you better Musick, If you'le hear it, Grave Counsell for your Soul, Xen. Il'e be at leasure Forty years hence to give you Audience, Grave Councell's best, when wee are near our Grave, It comes too soone now. Mon. Then't may come too late. Xen. Adde but another word Ile send thee on an Errand to the wormes. Mon. Im'e going thither on my own accord. Xen. Ile cause you mend your Pace, and make you fly. Mon. Small gaine to you, less loss will come to me, The whole Cloth of my life is measured out, Onely the List is left mee. Eud. A list indeed spun of course threed, And your Rude Manners shew it. Xen. The Hangman shall confute your Arguments, A Rope may hold you who have broke the Lute. Mon. The Gallowes though it be the worst of waies, May lead an Innocent to the best of ends. Xen. With shame &amp; Paine He shall your Death contrive Mon. Both shame &amp; Paine my Patience shall orecome. Art. Good Madam do but heare him what He'le say Xen. What do you hold that Musick is not lawfull? Mon. Yes, but at present, 'tis not seasonable, Best Musick's now but discord, and doth Jarre With these sad times, We feel bad and fear worse. Iren. We did it but to drive away the time. Mon. What need to drive, what of it self doth fly? Our Nature's bad at best, and must it have Bad Songs to be the Pandars to our Lust? So to awake our sleeping badnesse, And Blow up the Sparks to fire with such Incentives. Xen. What made you thus to break my curious Lute? Jr. Tameness it self how could It turn so wild? Eud. How com your Purity to burne with wrath? Mon. For the most part 'twas done against my will, So much as was done with it, was ill done, Art. Did ever Man more freely fault confesse? Xen. I'de thought your perfectnesse had bin most just. Mon. Just nothing 'tis. Xen. I see you would be sad, If all your faults were in your forehead writ. Mon. I should be glad my forehead would conteyn them. But Ladies, If a Lute's so easily broke, How quickly is our life?â Of brittle matter we are made, And such As strait is shatter'd with a casual touch. Art. All Accidents he turns into devotion. Mon. Then Ladies lay these lustful Toyes aside, And for uncertain certain death provide, This life's a moment whereon doth depend, Either our Weal or Wo, both without End. Xen. The houre's run out, your Sermon should be done. Mon. Soon will the houre-glasse of your life be run. [She offers to strike him. Nay, I'le be gone, Woful is her condition, Who when most sick, most scorneth her Physician. Exit. SCENE 6. Xen. Go doting Coxcomb, th'hast surviv'd thy wit, Priviledg'd by thy basenesse from my Anger, We scorn to stoop unto so low revenge. Eud. Madam, do you know the man? Xen. Yes, for a fool, It is Monobius the great Hermite of Greece. Eud. What? he that fill'd all Europe with his name, And almost tir'd out Fame, though most industrious To carry his report to every eare, Xen. How basely he appears now in mine eye, Oft have I wisht to see him. Now I wish I ne're had seen him, Art. Or rather that she had ne're heard him. [aside Eud. None can the Jewel by the Casket value, An ill face often doth much worth suppresse. Distance makes things seem greater then they be If one could touch, none would adore a Starre. Our hearing deifies what our sight defies. Xen. But, Lutanist, what quite put out of Tune? Lets hear you sing, though you can't playâ Lad. 'Tis shame one skill'd in Poetry, Without an Epitaph should die, Or that my Lute which held so long, Should now be broke without a Song; His fiery zeal sure wanted fewel, Which made him spoil my woodden Jewel. Its hard to say, as matters stood, Lute or Man, which was most wood. Xen. Good! good! Enter Menander. Mon. Bad! bad! Is this a time to sing? VVhen our arm'd foes are ready at the Port? Andronicus is entring with his Army. Xen. Heavens forbid. Mon. His sword will out-sharp your prayers. Protesebastus is march't out to meet him, And led with him a Rout of Plunderers. VVe in their valour do repose no trust, Souldiers which prey on friends, prove prey to foes. The City's great and false, what it will do, It must do at a push, for if it pause, Their Swords first more then Steel, prove lesse then straws. Xen. Monobius! Oh now for Monobius! That he were here to spend his prayers for us. I have bin dumb to th'Heavens, And they will Be deaf to me; Artemia, you in him Have interest. Beseech him to employ His best devotions to obtain successe. Give him this Jewel from me. Art. I'le see't done. [Exeunt Xen. Eud. and Irene. Thus in cold weather on we buckle fast Those Clothes which we away in heat did cast. SCENE 7. Artemia. Menander. Art. Dear husband, meddle no more in this matter, Lend not your Finger to Andronicus, To help him hither. Men. Prethee wife, why so? Art. The man's extremely vitious. And he must At last be woful, If the Heavens be just, Men. I hope you have but lately turn'd Statist. Art. I never medled with affaires of State? Men. Can you see further into things then I? Art. I can stand by whiles you do play the game. Men. Belike your Ladiship's a Prophetesse. Art. By present things I future can foresee, And shrewdly too. Men. That all the World doth know, Your tongue will be depos'd, you are too sharp. Art. I'm one which wish you well, Sharp natures prove Ofttimes more wholesom then a luscious Love. âHere I beseech you on my bended knees, [She falls on her knees. âUnseen of all, save him who all things sees, âBy those most sacred Matrimonial Bands âWhich first did tie our hearts, and then our hands. âBy all your sons, and by your only daughter, âBy what hath past 'twixt us, or may hereafter. Men. See how the tears do trickle down her cheeks. Come spend them freely, you have a Mint of them. These womens eyes are Springs. Art. Mens hearts are Rocks, Men. Go Madam, meddle with your own Preserves, Art. I would preserve your safetie if I might. Men. Then meddle with your Sweet-meats, see they be good In taste and colour, Consult with your Sempstress Strike into the newest fashion, first and best. Out-Gorget all the Ladies in the Court, But meddle not with things above your reach, Your Sex was made to learn and not to teach. Exit Art. Farewel, dear husband. You jeer my Grief. And yet I wish you joy, (But none can save those who destroy) themselves. Towards my husband this I will averr, M'affections shall not erre, my judgment may, We wives unto our husbands may commend Our best Advice with all Humility, Our Parts to offer, but their Power to chuse; Who if they do refuse their happinesse, This will our conscience ease in all distresse, We did our Duty, though deny'd successe. But here's Monobius. SCENE ult. Enter Monobius. Art. The Empresse does commend her self to you, Desires you that you would send your devotions To Heaven for successe on her designes. Mon. What designes? Some lustful Sonnets to provoke her nature, Pregnant with Atheism, and black blasphemy. Art. Our foes this instant do invade the City. Mon. She lately did despise our pious Councel. Art. Its ne're too late to be or good or wise. Mon. We're slighted till the moment when we're needed. Art. Your Goodness writes no wrong except in Dust. Mon. She with ill language wrong'd my Innocence. Art. Can you be angry, that do teach us patience? Mon. Then let Her for her selfe powre forth her Praiers. Art. Ah! Her Devotions are growne strangers quite To Heaven, where yours are dayly knowne and heard, This Jewell she injoyned me to present you. Mon. Jewells like hypocrites shine in mens eyes, Whereas no reall value lyes in either. [He lookes upon it. The Price of Stones, by inward worth I set In th'loadstone, nature placeth reall Treasure Grand Pylot to all Ships, by'ts love to North, A Flint contains the sparkes of secret worth, These of themselves are of no certaine valew. But do pride of People, fall or rise. Give me the Diamond of Patience, and The spotlesse Christall of pure Innocence, The Amethyst of true Sobriety, Ruby of Martyrs, and the Virgins Pearle. Art. It was her pleasure, to present it to you. Mon. Returne it, and my Answer back to her, Tell her, that I my Princes do give, not sell. Tell her from me, Friends Pryers, good seconds are. Yet on our owne, we must as firsts rely. They which do pray by Proxey, find at last, By Proxey also they shall go to Heaven! But let her know, I will improve my Best, For that's my Duty which is her Request. Chorus consisting of two Companies. 1. Chor. What meane you by this mighty Packe? Each makes a Waggon of his backe. 2. Chor. Need you see well soone inure, Us heavy burthens to endure. But though our backs should broken be, Ou care's to keep a Conscience free. 1. Chor. Tell us, to what place, we pray, You intend to shape your way? 2. Chor. Whither Providence shall guid us, Where we shall finde hope to hide us. Or Italy, Or PÃ¦lestine. Or neere the Banke of Nile, or Rhine. We shall wander altogether, Be't from hence, we care not whither. 1. Chor. Let's advise you stay a while, Matters may hereafter smile. 2. Chor. There is danger in delay, In a tottering State to stay, In those Ruins we'd be loath. To be Slaine, and buried both. 1. Chor. You do little love expresse To your Country in distresse. Bragg no more of Conscience, With which you can so well dispence. We're resolved not to fly, Here we liv'd, and here we'le die. 2. Chor. Even the worst of wormes will strive, To preserve it self a live. We from Bruites may learne this Reason, To foresee a stormy Season, Then to hast to shady Bowres, Tymely to prevent the Showres. 1. Chor. But pray tell us is it faire, Now to seek a forreign Aire? In our Sins you bare a part, From our sufferings now you start. And on us throw all the Load, By deserting your Aboad. We're resolved not to fly, Here we liv'd, and here we'le die. 2. Chor. As our Sins have done you wrong, So our prayers shall help along. Absent, present, that's all one, Stay we here, or be we gone, We shall in this Point be even, Our prayers with yours shall meet in Heaven. 1. Chor. But we better do approve, To amend, and not remove. For better Manners we will change, But not for a Countrey strange. Here to stay our selves intend, But away our Sins we'le send. Take heed you meet not what you shun, And running from Death, on death run. Be it better, be it worse, Come a blessing, come a curse. Here we did of Plenty tast, And we here intend to Fast. Here of sweet we had our Part, Here we'le also share in Smart. We're Resolved not to fly, Here we liv'd, and here we'le die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCENE 1. Enter Cleobulus and Paleologus. Cleob. Unfold dear Friends, I prithee what, what's the Newes? Paleol. 'Tis bad, you'le be the worse for hearing it. Cleob. I can condole, I can congratulatt, And time my selfe to fate, with greife or joy, Be't what it will, O let it be discover'd, Bad Newes conceal'd, is for farre worse suspected. Paleol. Andronicus entred the City easily. Cleob. His Army did not equall ours for Number. Paleol. No not by farre, but we cumberd our selves did With foremeles crouds of Men some hearts, did faint, And others fought not willing to prevaile. Cleob. 'Tis hard to make them fight, who meane to fly. 'Tis harder to oppose The treachery of Friends, then force of Foes. Paleol. Great Cities which are swoln in length and breadth, Are commonly much over-fam'd in strength. Cleob. If they be entred they are soone conquer'd to, Their mighty Bulk sinks under it's owne weight. Paleol. Protosebastos was took in the place, And cruelly his eyes were boared out, Hence he advanced to the Pallace next, and there Seiz'd on the person of Alexius, Yet us'd him with all possible respect. Took the Empresse Zena lying on her Bed, Confin'd her to a Prison, where shee's now. Cleob. How did her honourable Ladies 'scape. Paleol. Eudoxa in the Lobby hid her self, Behinde the Traverse did Irene skulke. Philoclea clim'd the Leades, Eugenia did breake a mighty wooden Barre in two. (None know what feare and frighted Folke can do) Got to the Garden; every one did shift, Artemia onely at a dead lift stayed. Cleob. But what, I pray, at last became of her. Paleol. Striving to save the Empresse, but in vaine, She was good Lady on a sudden slayne. Cleob. I'me sorry for Artemias wofull death. Paleol. She was a Thiefe, and truly rob'd all others, Vertue was constant leiger in her brest. Cleob. And yet her Husband did despise and slight her. Paleol. But now by looseing, he hath learn'd to prize her. I must be gone, my occasions prove Tyrants to me. Cleob. Heavens grant! you may never see worse Tyrants! Bads the beginning, what will be the end, With hope and feare, we'le patiently attend. Exeunt. SCENE 2. Enter Menander, and six of his Servants in Mourning, bringing Artemi'as Corps in a Black Coffin under a Velvet Herse; And advance it in the midst of the Roome. Mon. Now cleare the place, and all your selves disperse, My obsequies I offer at this Herse. [He kneeles before it. Here ly her Corps, which when she fed on breath Led the best life, had the most wofull death. She was not faire to take a Wantons eyes, But comely, for to please the heart of th'wise. She was not witty with the froth of Braine, But her rich Brest did solid worth containe. She ever did adore a private life, I lov'd the Court, Hence oft arose our strife. Sometimes good Counsel she'd to me commend, And therin both her selfe and sex transcend. I would not yeeld, yet could not truth oppose, With her my Judgment, not my Will did close. I lik'd the Counsel well, had I first found it, But Scorn'd to take it from her hand rebounded. How sweetly shee my anger would decline, Request my pardon, when the fault was mine. I'me vext oft time, she would not leave me vext, I wanting a just cause to be perplext. I must smile at Her innocent deceit, Whereby she me did into mirth so cheat. Sweet Soule, which now doest dwell in endlesse Blisse, Oh pardon what to thee I've done amisse! Alas! It was my passion, 'twas not I. I'le now do Pennance to thy Memory, I will not vow that I will never wedd, Those which forsware first clime the Marriage-Bed. So ill anothers minde to us is knowne, Than we our selves are strangers to our owne. And our meandrous hearts so full of turning, Where's now a sparke, may quickly be a burning But I'me resolved, and hope it, that no other Shall by my Children be saluted Mother. I have farre off an unsuspected home, Where safely dwells, and Warre can scarsely come. Thither I'le hast, and all the Counsel grave, Which this dear Saint, me in her life-time gave. Il'e in my heart record with lasting letter, She's withered, but her words now'l grow the better. Nor wonder at this drought, because no shower Of brackish Teares downe on my Cheekes do powre. They which mourne much, are seldome mourning long, Besides Teares in my eyes, stick in a throng. The lesse my Soul grieves, there's the more greif in't, My Heart's a Fountaine, though my Eyes be flint. SCENE 3. Enter Andronicus, Alexius, Panergus, Asotus, and Spiculator. Andr. Your Highnesse now appears in your full lustre, Free'd from the wardship of your factious Peers. Alex. Therein we owe much to your diligence. Andr. We have expressed some small part of our duty, And are still ready to performe the rest. Still one thing is to do, which being done, No Clouds can Darken your now glorious Sun. Alex. What is't? Andr. I can reveale it t'you with safety, And yet with loyalty I can conceale it. 'Tis the unhappy Zena. Alex. What, my Mother? Andr. Your goodnesse 'tis, that's pleas'd to style Her so, Fathers o'th'Countrey never did know Mothers Royall affections onely do designe, The Publique good oth, Place they Governe in. She must be made away. Alex. For such a Crime Nero's recorded Monster to all Ages. Andr. His was a damned and unnaturall deed, This is an Act of Justice, and Necessity. Alex. She gave me life, what shall I cause her death? Andr. That life She seeks from you to take againe. Alex. Let her be soone confin'd to some close Covent. Andr. Close with her Body, to be loose in Minde. Alex. That She may Heaven, and pious Thoughts enjoy. Andr. And plot how to destroy you, and the State. Alex. Stay but a while, Her Age will save our paines, A yeare or two will post her to the Grave. Andr. You right your selfe the more, and do wrong not her, Few years of Hers will impe your Reigne. Asot. With your owne hand, do you the Warrant signe. Andr. I'de rather loose my Arme to save her life. Pan. He only is concern'd i'th'publique good, Takes no delight in shedding Womens blood. Alex. Write you my Name. Andr. My heart abhors all fraud. Aso. Ducks cannot swim, you cannot counterfeit. (aside. Alex. 'Tis no deceit, when done by my Command, But if it must be so, we'le set our hand. [He Signes the Warrant. Andr. Sure Heaven did guide your Pen, how faire you write. Not like those Lords, who mak't their cheifest Art To cozen others by their writing ill. Posterity shall reare Trophyes to you, And future Kings shall swear by your just Ghost. Aso. He quickly meanes to make a Ghost of you [aside. Andr. Spiculator, take this Warrant, about your businesse. Spicu. I fly Sir. [Exit Speculator. SCENE 4. Manent Andronicus, Alexius, Asotus, Panergus. Alexius falls a weeping. Andr. Nay, do not now repent so good a deed. Alex. Must not a Sonne bemoane his Mothers Death. Andr. They are your Mother which do love you best. Al. Much kindness always she exprest to me, Andr. She lov'd her self, and did abuse your power. Now freed from her your self may use that power. Pan. Sh'as dead whilst living, drown'd in Luxury. A. More reason sh'ad liv'd longer to repent. Andr. At my cost fifty Friers both night and day Shall Dirges duly pay for her souls health. Pan. How bountifull's Andronicus in giving gifts His goodness doth ingage both dead and living. Andr. I do appeal that divine eye To which midnights noon day, darkness doth shine. Who doth descry at distance all our thoughts, Y'abortive thoughts which never born do die How from my heart I love your Highness now, And joy in you above all earthly joyes. Alex. Thanks for thy kindness dear Andronicus T'shal be remembred by us and rewarded. Asot: Tis time to dine, nature grows discontented. Andr. May these my teeth turn mourners black as Jett. And let my tongue set in an endless silence, And never more make sacred melody, Asot. And never more proceed to cog and ly, (aside. Andr. If any meat they do presume to tast Before my soul hath pass'd it by a Prayer Alex. I do commend your pious resolution. Andr. He doth deserve to lose a large revenue, That cares not that small quit-rent to discharge. Such are the thanks which we to heaven do owe, For all the favours which it doth let fall, We can't do less, nor is there more requir'd. Pan. How full's his heart inspir'd with holy yeal Asot. So full of kernel is an empty husk, [Aside. Th'Ãgean stable was so full of musk. Andr. I go unto S. Sophyes Church to pray A Closet best fits my Devotions At other times, but now it is too narrow, Having receiv'd a great and publike grace It calls for solemn thanks and publike too, At my return I shall attend your Highness. Exit. Alex. Send us your good devotion. Aso. Sure this Religion will not be long lasting I have no stomack to this Feigned Fasting. Exeunt. SCEN. 5. Enter Paleologus and Crato. Pal. Andronicus is gone to his devotions, Cra. The Devil hee's at's devotions, he is gone Unto his Junto, there they do debate, How to confer the Imperial Crown on him. Pal. I never had a Fancy to these Juntoes, Cr. They'r absolutely needful in a State. Pal. Let me have things discuss'd at Councel Board In free and full appearance, where 'tis no Treason With solid reason to displease a Prince, Brave bandying points of State, now off, now on, With Troops of Arguments brought Pro and Con Where every Councellor may have his due To be heard out, (though haply not beleev'd) Now things in private ways are smothered. Cra. Such smothering gives the life unto great actions. Secresie is the soul of grand designs, You'd have them first proclaim'd i'th'Marketplace, And made the second course at th'Ordinaries. âGoods ventur'd in most bottoms most secure, âBut secrets known to fewest brests most sure. His Junto's but of sour; the first himself, The Patriarch next, Lapardas and Panergus. Pal. One may keep counsel, if there be one more How many matters not, fourty or four, If one o'th four prove false, the action fails Ships drown as deep with one as fourty leaks, Cra. Experience proves Juntoes of most dispatch, The fewer set on brood the more are hatch'd, And where most doers are, the least is done. Pal. What are these men the wisest in the State? Are they most honest, or most fortunate? Cra. Most fortunate in this, they'r most intrusted: Pal. But do they best deserve trust, and discharge it? Amongst those many late Monopolies, Which swell'd mens private gain with publike loss. (Heavens grant no Courtier may ingross the Sun Poor people should pay dear then for fair weather) None like to this for a few men to sit Eternal and most absolute Dictators, Controul, add, alter, ratifie, reverse, Whilst others which with them claim equal share, Concernd alike in the countries charge and care, Yea have the most at stake, are lookers on, Sometimes admitted to concur by chance, But kept in wholsome Ignorance for the main. Cra. This must be so, Great Councels this great mischief doth attend, Therein mens judgements justle, sometimes thwart, (More minding private Betts, then th'publike game) A Junto in one currant doth unite. Pal. O 'tis safest where there is a multitude, Cra. Of Councellors to debate, but not conclude. Pal. The more the eyes, the more they do discern, Cra. A Junto sees with's own and others eyes, It doth begin where the great Councel ends Takes their results, and thereon spend its verdict. âThat Silver which is oftnest tried's most pure, âThat Councel which is most refin'd most sure. But let's be gone, they'r up, Here comes the Patriarch. Exeunt. SCEN. 6. Enter Basilius the Patriarch, and Monobius. Bas. Let's now renew our old acquaintance, friend, It is an age since our last interview, Mon. But Sir, I come to chide your Holiness That earth you practise, and yet profess a heaven. Bas. Unriddle your own words. Mon. Y'ave bin of late, An over-active stickler in the Nation. Bas. Earth's but my Inne, but I make heaven my home, Mon. I fear you oft mistake your Inn for home, You are not stor'd with forrein observations. Bas. We are enabled by our educations; This does admit us to a general knowledge, For Schollership doth fit us for all callings. Mon. None can attend two callings at one time. Bas. Yes if subordinate, as means and end. Mon. But these are opposite, the Church and State. Bas: Hippocrates his twins did never meet With a more mutual love then these agree, Do you advance State-matters 'bove our reach Mon. I stoop them far beneath your cognizance, Such medling draws the Laities envie on us. Bas. Such envie keeps the Laity more in awe. Mon. But you should rather labour for their love. Bas. Love without awe proves seldome lasting to us, But to the point, with secular affairs Meddle we may, but must not be intangled. Mon. The one cannot be done without the other. Bas. As if no man could feed but he must furfet. Mon. This World's a Witch, and quickly it will charm us. Bas. I know t'arm my soul with Counterspels, Would you shut a Divine out of the State? Mon. No, in the State I would confine his work So far as to consult, not act therein. Bas. Hence would a lazie Clergy soon proceed Mon. State-laziness doth breed Church-industry, âMark Clergy-Sticklers on the Civil Stage, âA quiet death doth seldome crown their Age. Bas. Proofs from th'event, men do esteem for Ciphers, Mon. Ciphers with figures joyn'd make numbers, John Golden-mouth long since your Predecessor, Did onely pray and preach, and read, and write, Which made him happy spight of all his foes. Bas. Why he was twice expel'd this place (poor man) Mon. And twice restor'd again with greater grace. Bas. He lost his place for want of policy, Mon. But gain'd his place with store of piety. Bas. Great Hippo's Prelate, through the world renown'd, For's Piety and Schollership, Kept in his House a Court of Conscience where When he had din'd he gave his neighbours audience. Redrest each grievance, and becalm'd each strife, Medled in state, and was a Civill Judge. Mon. Hereby he worthily did raise his fame, Bas. You blame in me, what you do praise in him, Mon. You cause dissentions, but he did compose them, You make th'wound wider, which he sought to close. Bas. You envy at the splendor of our height, Mon. Just as I do to see a Gloe worm shine. Bas. Your envie's at the Lustre of our place. Mon. I pitty from my heart your woful condition. I will not turn my Cowl into your Mitre. Exit Monobius Bas. You kick down pride, with greater pride; Farewel, Farewell. SCENE ult. Enter Panergus, and Cleobulus. Bas. VVhat good success Panergus have we had! Pan. The matters mannag'd well, the number mounteth. A hundred thousand names this Parchment holds, But here's Cleobulus I've not his Name yet. Cleo. Welcome Panergus, what always imploy'd? Pa. Here is a Parchment, set to it your hand. Cleo. I'le first peruse it: Bas. Put on your eyes of glass, and then consult. He reads it to himself. Cl. In this Petition we do humbly crave, Andronicus his goodness would be pleas'd, To be joint Emperour with Alexius. Pa. You speak the very marrow of the matter. Cl. Had I a hundred hands, I'de set them to't. Pa. Thanks good Cleobulus, I did ever finde, Your noble heart inclin'd to th'publike good. Cl. In a short time you many hands have gotten. Pa. To get them there were many hands imploi'd. Cl. Tell me what act and method did you use. Pa. In every Parish, Family, or Tribe, We got the signal men first to subscribe, And their example easily drew the rest, Whole Herds of sillie people prest on us, Names for our Parchment we at first did lack, But Parchment for our Names at last grew scant. Cl. Did they peruse what was therein contain'd? Pa. Be't Bond, be't Bill, be't Libel, be't Petition, They thought it sin should they not make their marks; Where they were told their betters went before. Cl. Some names are forg'd here, but's a good deceit. Pa. You know old Courtiers know to counterfeit. Cl. This is a Womans writing: Pa. In Husbands absence, wife stands for husband. Cl. They should have put their tongues, then not their hands. Pa. If any did refuse we threatned them, Or did return their names which is far worse. Cl. The Subjects freedom's thus by force preserv'd. Pa. But we lose time, come set your hand to't, comeâ Cl. My hand shall sooner rot, then I will do't. Bas. Said you not if you had a hundred hands You would subscribe. Cl. I then should be a Monster, When Monster I'le subscribe, not whilst a man. Bas. Why are you irregular from all the rest. Cl. Why are the rest irregular from right. Pa. Are you more holy then the Patriarch? More just then all the Judges and more wise, Then all the Councellors of State beside? That what they grant should be deni'd by you: Cl. Ile not beleeve with an implicite faith, Nor pin my soul upon anothers sleeve, To them their Reasons known, and mine to me, My soul stands on a Basis of its own: Unto Alexius his great grandfather My Infancy I was a subject born, To's Grandfather my youth was servant, and To's Father my old age was Councellor, And therefore to his Son I will be just, âI'le lose my life, but not betray my trust. Pa. He shall be but joynt Emperour with him Cl. If Crowns admit a Mate, they'le prove a Master, Two husbands to one wife, I'le not allow; Such Bigamy of State I can't approve. Pa. Alexius young, with old Andronicus, Will make a wholsom Medley for our State; The one brings hands, the other judgments; The one shall Act, the other shall advise, Headlong his speed, his gravity is staid, His heat of youth allaid with ages cold. Cl. I love no by-Paths from the beaten Road, Two Suns i'th Firmament no good can bring. Pa. Is this your Answer? Cl. All you'r like to have. Pa. Then farewel froward fool: Anothers loss Thou count'st thy only gain, and loves to cross. Cl. In this Scene both you have been cunning Actors, No doubt the Merchant will reward his Factors. Exeunt. CHORUS. Constantinople the Worlds Queen Asia and Europe plac'd between, Sick for having too much health, Broke by getting too much wealth. Where anciently dwelt harmless thrift, And industry made honest shift; In Ships and Shops truth us'd in dealing, Nowt here's nothing us'd but stealing, Pride doth swell, and lust doth boyl, Envie fret, oppression spoil. Should our Grandsires now arise, And view thee in this strange disguise, Their judgement it would much perplex, By Cloaths to guesse the wearers sex; Transform'd with such fantastick shapes, 'Tis hard to say they're men or Apes; Their sight at such a losse would be, Thee for thy self they could not see. Except they chanced to behold, Saint Sophies Temple built of old; (Whose reverend ruines woo our Nation, To give it speedy Reparation) By this perchance the place they'd own, And Church might make the City known. Constantinople thou great City, Whom none can help, though many pitty; Woful if thou knew'st thy Lot, More woful 'cause thou know'st it not; Nature hath thee fully blest, If vertue had suppli'd the rest. Venice is a City fair, But because it wants sweet aire; Florence sweet by rivers side, But that river hath no tide, Genoa lyes the tide along, But her ancient walls not strong. Nuremberg for strength renown'd, But 'tis built on barren ground. Rome doth stand on fruitful hills, But much emptines it fills. Paris full of buildings high, But it in dirt too low doth lie. All want something thou hast all, Which we can a blessing call, Thy Water, Earth, and Air compleat, Sweet, rich, strong, fertile, full and neat; This misery thou hast alone, That miseries thou hast had none. Thy long peace did plenty bring, From thy plenty pride did spring; From thy pride came woful jarrs, And from these came bloody warrs; And from warrs comes desolation, O begin thy circulation, By amendment to obtain, That thy peace return again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCENE 1. Enter Paleologus, Crato, Cleobulus. Pa. Less Passion and more reason would do wel. Cr. It is not worth th'engaging passion About a Probleme. Pa. Here's Cleobulus, We will refer it to his Umpeerage, Cr. Agreed. Pa. We have long debated here, Whether that married people in a State, Prove better Members, or th'unmarried? Cr. Tyresias tasted of both sexes, you, Of both estates, being now a widdower. Lets hear your judgement. Cl. Lets hear your Arguments, They'l be most careful to preserve the ship, Pa. Who therein have most store of goods imbarkt. Cr. Batchellours have an Adventure in the state, Pa. Yes, but a single share whilst married folk, For present and for future are ingaged; Persons posterity, selves, and succession. Cr. Marriage debates the valour of the soul, We without any cautelous demurs, Are proud to lose our lives for the publick good. Whilst that you husbands warily do start. An hundred fears from your own jealous minds Leave a young widdow, she will quickly wed; And bring some lusty gallant in my room, My eldest son a ward scarse ten years old, My greedy gardians will be bought and sold; My younger chlldren unprovided for. Such thoughts ungallant souls and spirits dull, And make brave resolutions to recoyle. Pa. Recoyle, but to come forward with more strength. And by your leave Sir, Batchelours do run, With headlong hast on actions of Treason. Whilst married men, reason and weigh the matter. 'Twill taynt my blood, undo my family, And brand it with eternall infamy. Such thoughts make loyall hearts, and spoile Treason, And make bad resolutions to recoyle. Cr. All this Proves but a goodness negative, That they do less harm, but to requite you, What most inclines a Judge unto corruption, His Lady wife must have a Diamond ring; Or set of Pearl, her maid a silken gown, Her Usher wants. C. Wit and a pair of Leggs. (Aside. Cr. Some gold to game with, hence come postern dores. And bribes in better language stiled presents, Pa. And I have known as corrupt Batchelours, Who were portentous in their vain expences, And then debase themselves again to recover. Cr. A narrow instance in some few generally. Pa. Mark who they were our Colledges have built. Cl. Mark who they are our Colledges have spilt, (Aside. Cr. Housed the muses, furnish't Libraries; Erected stately structures, founded schools, Most men unmarried. While your low thoughts nor dare nor can aspire, Above the raising of a family. The matching of your Daughters rich and high, But maiden breasts ambitious are to wed, Honour whilst living, and when dying make, Fame their executor, and the world their heir. Cr. Now speak your judgement good Cleobulus, Cl. I am loath my verdict thus to interpose: You now are friends. Cr. And never shall be foes, For ought that you in this point shall determine. Cl. My judgements this married men generally, Are less good, and less bad, then Batchelours. But here comes those who in no estate, Will e're do any good to th'Common Wealth. SCENE 2. Enter Andronicus, Basil, Lapardos, Lanergus, Cleobulus, &amp;c. In a full Councel of state. An. A pleasant prospect to my eye appears, Old heads, more rich in wisdom then in years. Ba. Your Highness here I humbly do beseech? To hear what I'm commanded to discover, With a rude tongue but with a loyall heart; An. We hearken let your holiness proceed, Ba. I am the mouth for millions of souls Whose names are lifted in these Parchment rolls, Their goodness and not my Ability. Cl. Your subtleness and their simplicity, (Aside. Ba. Made them to chuse me here to represent, Their cordiall desires, Beseeching that your Highness would be pleas'd, The young Alexius may so far be help'd; As that with him you'd be joynt Emperour. An. Interpret Sir, your language, I profess; I cannot guess whats your misterious sense. Ba. Vouchsafe to bear the weight of half the Crown: Nor will it ought offend your humble mind, That you who all deserve share but a part: Thus the Roman Senate antiently did match, Spritefull Marcellus, in dispatch too quick, With old delaying Fabius, and so; Well blended age with youth, the sloth with swiftness, No better cure for this our sad distempers, Then to apply this sacred composition. An. Go choose some gallant full of daring youth: And brave in mind whose very flesh is steel'd, Can match all day and lie i'th'field all night, And upon him bestow your ancient Crown, Whose vast Atchievements may renown it, See I am old decrepit and decay'd: Age my streight arrow brings a bowe. (shews his crooked body Cl. The bowe doth onely wart a handsome string. (Aside. An. Gray head, Pale cheeks, dim eyes, faint heart, weak hands. A coffin is more meet then a Crown for me, No Royall robes like to a winding sheet. Ba. Consider Sir, a reasonable request. An. Of late I've found what long I was a seeking, A private place to coole my soul from th'heat: Caus'd from the hot pursuance of this world, My enemies long since I have subdu'd, It now remains I should subdue my self, I must confess (no shame to tell the truth) Bad's my old age, but far worse was my youth, Disturbe not then my soul which now begins A serious recollection of it's sins. Ba. Can piety prefer its private health, Before the profit of the Common wealth? Shall all mens wishes be withstood by one Whose humbleness doth cross the publick good. An. I know this spacious Empires breadth and length, It is a weight too heavy for my strength. Pan. Let's follow him and be importunate, [He departeth seemingly discontented Pal. and Pan. follow him.] SCENE 3. Manent Cleobulus, Crato, and Paleogulus. Cl. Andronicus though born a Grecian. In's youth amongst the Latines dwell, And there did learn, two negatives do make An affirmation. Pa. Cunning maides in tryall, Thus to their suitors complements Denyal, Cr. He is an arrant dissembler, I think he partly credits his own lyes. Cl. Others believe him not when he speaks truth. Pa. Shall we look on, &amp; see him steal a Crown thus? Cl. Do you oppose him. Pa. Nay do you Cleobulus, Cl. I am too old to do it. Pa. And I too young, Cr. Thus none will do what all desire were done. Pa. I will preserve my self for better times. Cl. You lose your conscience so, and keep your self, Pa. 'Tis vain to oppose him, we must yield; Thus they who long have striven against the stream, With force there, at last are driven away But here they are again. Cr. He did go out to be intreated in. SCENE 4. Enter Andronicus, Basil, Lapardas, and Panergus. Ba. You must not Sir, withstand a general good. Pa. The intreates of a whole state do command. An. I may the publick good most lawfully, Deny t'advance a creature publick good Weak friends deserve states more then stronger foes, And seeming to assist it, do oppose it, Whilest undertaking what they cannot mannage. Ba. How high the audit of your vertues swell, It would torment your ears if I should tell you Who are acquainted with your worthy actions, More pleased to deserve, then hear you praise. An. Such vertues in my self I cann't discover, Pa. 'Tis your humility doth make you blinde. Ba. âThat face which most for beauty doth surpass, âSee's not it self save onely in a glass, Be pleas'd from us to know your own perfection, And by reflection read your vertues here. Pa. Your graces all are plainly shewn to us. An. But ah, my vices best are known to me, It much afflicts my tender conscience Thus to resist your holy violence, On one condition Ile accept your profer. Ba. What's that condition dear Andronicus. An. Promise that you will help in high affairs, That when our shoulders shrink or back doth wring, With weight of business you'd afford supporters. Om. In such a case we solemnly protest, That we perform our best and uttermost An. Hereafter if you find cause to repent. The doings of this day then blame your selves, I wash my hands thereof, Such importunity would batter heaven. Cl. Such a dissembler could teach hell to flatter [Aside. Ba. From this Suns mounting in our hemisphear, Hence forward wee'll begin to date our year This day i'th'front o'th'Almanack wee'l place, And or'e the rest in scarlet Text command. Cl. Dy'de redd with Traytors perjury and guilt And Royall Princes blood which will be spilt. [Aside. An. Seeing now t'ath bin your pleasure to elect me, Ile be the onely master of requests, To me shall all repair that are oppressed, No bribes shall overbear a widdows cause Wee'l rescue right out of oppressions paws; Wee'l judge the Judges if they do amiss; New laws we will enact and repeal should, As fresh occasions themselves do offer But all with generall consent, 'tis wrong, Some should ingross what doth belong to all. But chiefly Il'e be carefull of my life, Princes examples daily do give breath Unto their Laws, Ile strive to live a law. Cl. A little of this done would go far, (Aside. An. And now me thinks by fifty springs and more I feel my self grown younger then I was, What of Medea's Baths the Poets faigned, Out of which Ãson came with youth recreated. What other Authors do report of th'Eagle, (Th'Eagle which is displayd in our standard, By loosing of her bill regains her youth; These toys and tales are found a truth in me. Cl. I think that with the Snake h'ath cast his skin, But all his poison still remains within him. [Aside. Ba. The Heavens new strength miraculously hath lent you, And for new burden hath new shoulders sent you, But lets unto S. Sophyes Church with speed, In publike view before your peoples eyes, Your Coronation we will solemnize. Exeunt omnes. SCEN. 5. Enter Maria, Cessarissa, and her Nurse. Nur. Good Lady, Be not drown'd in Passion, Anger's short fury. Mar. Furie's then long Anger, Nur. Were here a glass that you might see your self, How strangely Passion hath transform'd your face, Displaces pale for red, and red for pale. Mar. When young I suckt your milk, but am not bound, To be rul'd by your Councel at these years. Nur. It was a wholsom breast that bred my milk, From loyal heart my Councel doth proceed. Mar. But here comes Paleologus, he'l speak for himself, Enter Paleologus. Mar. Out of my sight, thou baseness I do scorn, To lose my eyes upon so low an object. Pal. I beg the favour but to know my fault. Mar. Greece is grown barbarous, and quite bereft, Of former worth, no not the dregs are left, Or so much ruines as may teach the strangers, And bring this forth to their sad remembrance; That once you had brave worthy Ancestors: The ancient Proverb was The valiant Greek, The modern Proverb is, The merry Greek, And mirth of late all manhood hath devourd, Fames Trumpet once did sound the youths of Greece, Who made their voyage for the Golden Fleece. You may adventure now for th'Asses skin. Pal. I would I could read your meaningâ Mar. What did my Father Manuel for this? Weaken his own to strengthen your estate, Who did not make your Fortunes but create 'um, Whose boundless bounty, vast magnificence Gave you more pounds then you were born to pence. He made you honourable, rich and great, Oh that he could have made you grateful too! Pal. Expound good Lady to us what you speak. Mar. To see a base Usurper mount the Throne, To mate and check your lawful Emperour. See it, and neither wag a hand nor tongue, Tame Traitors all. Pa. I do deny your words, And would defie the Speaker, were you a man? Mar. Had nature moulded me a man, before Things should go as they doe, I'de swim in blood, They're Traytors which consent to treason. Pa. True. Mar. And they who don't oppose it do consent. Pa. Yes having power and office to resist it. Mar. All have an office, to resist Usurpers. Pa. All have not power. Mar. Not power? a loyall minde, Sufficient power will quickly make or finde. Pa. What would you have us do? destroy our selves. Mar. No, I would have you to preserve your Prince. Pan. Our selves, We for his safety do reserve. Mar. To give him Physick when he's three days dead. Pa. Do but consider seriously our case, And whom your passion now condemns for fools, Your judgment will acquit, and praise for wise, Our lives, our lands, are at the sole disposing, And cruel mercy of our potent foes. If any whisper but the lowest word Of Loyalty, there's one to cut his throat. Hence houses rifled, goods pillag'd, lands forfeited, Our selves disabled from all further service, Had we not better for a time comply; Spend what we please in thoughts, but speak nothing, Bow to our foes, that they may not break us. Storms will not always last, when this is over, In season due we will discover our selves. N. Me thinks he speaks proportion'd to reason. Pa. By what your Father did bestow on me, To whom next to the Heavens I ow my self, I vow I want not, will but wait a time, With best effect to shew my Loyalty, It will the better speed for this long pause. Mar. Be thine the tongue's, no matter what's the cause? Concealed Loyalty as well as lands, We hope at last will fall to'th Princes hands, And let no Nobles hope their worth will shine, Who make the Sun of Majesty decline; If Honours spring be dry, 'tis vain to dream, That Rivers thence deriv'd can have a stream. Exeunt. SCEN. Ult. Enter Andronicus, Panergus, and Basilius. And. Lets see the List, Read it Panergus, then will we declare, Whom we think fit to save, whom fit to kill. Pan. Maria CÃ¦sarissa is the first, Bas. Sirs, she's a woman, may she not be spar'd? An. What is your holiness in love with her? I tell you Sir, she is more then a woman, An able active brain, a daring spirit, She does inherit her father Manuels parts, She shall be kill'd. Pa. How will you dispose of her husband? An. I have solemnly observed in all my time, Never to part the husband and the wife Pa. Assotus followeth, what's your highness pleasure, An. Erect a scaffold in the Market place, And there behead him, this shall be his crime His riot ill imprest the waxen youth, Of young Alexius this will render us, Just to the people, and gain reputation. Pa. Morio the jester next i'th list succeeds, Bas. His body downward's fool, his head's a knave; Court passages he cunningly doth mark, And vents them by the priviledge of his coate In wary twilight betwixt jest and earnest. An. Ile not infringe the grand Charter of jesters, 'Tis ancient, and he's beneath my anger. Pa. But Sir, Isachius must be lookt unto, He is the next of the Imperial line. An. Let him alone poor narrow hearted soul: To enjoy his books, and beads, and crucifixes. He lives, it'h covent and there let him live, Ba. Hee's loath to wake a Lyon that doth sleep. (Asid. Pa. Then comes Cleobulus who first deni'de Unto our grand petition to subscrib, He must be kill'd. An. He must be kept alive. Pa. Strange reason Sir, An. Our pleasure is our reason. We do delight to cross mens expectations, And love to leave th'mazed world at loss They shall not trace the Labyrinth of my actions, Wee'l slay, whom they think we will save and whom, They think wee'l slay wee'l save, the more their thoughts Are thus defeated, they'l admire And what they cannot understand adore, Pa. Next Paleologus doth take his turn, An. A dangerous youth, high birth, and higher parts, His mind above his means, dispatch him sure. Pa. But Sir, on what pretence must these be kill'd? Some thing must be alleadged first, like truth, To satisfie the mouths of greedy people. An. Power never wanted pretences, and those just, And legall for to do what it desir'd, Accuse them, that they lately have conspir'd Against our sacred person, Knights o'th post, Of th'Devils dubbing quickly shall depose it, Their tongues are hired for trifles, and ther's nought Save honesty, but here it may be bought. Pa. Crato doth next succeed. An. Enough at once, I do desire Alexius should be Well waited on in's progress to his grave, All these shall Usher him, such as remain Shall follow after to hold up his train. Some dishes in our first course we dispose, Others reserve therewith to close our meal. Chorus consisting of two companies of old men. 1. Chor. Neighbours, what news? tell us we pray, The issue of this pregnant day, For now, alass, 'tis all our task, News to tell, or news to ask. And arived at these years, Our hands, are turn'd to tongues and ears. 2. Chor. Gull'd with lyes wee'l be no more, Which so oft were gull'd before. Nor will be rob'd by Pamphlet-thief, First of our coyn, then our belief, All truth is mounted to the skies, And all that's left below are lyes. 1. Chor. Speak you of the other side? What you say is not denide, Our foes no open forging spare: The Country vents the City ware, Lyes and money both they mynt, Those sons number, that by stynt. 2. Chor. Both sides in lying twins are Grown, But for the Elder, theirs we own, We started last, have nigh o're got, Them, and the coppy which they wrote: So imitate, 'tis hard to say. Master, scholler, we, or they. 1. Chor. 'Tis true we're all o'th Poets straine, All are poor, all use to feign. Henceforth it shall be our care, Onely to tell, and trust our share. What news soever men do talk, Two parts of three, we will defalk. 2. Chor. Nay, of some news was told a late, Twice five of ten you must abate. Castles i't'h air they made to stand, And march'd o're seas, and sail'd o're land. With such improbable relations, Were both the tales, and consultations. 1. Chor. Such news are useful in these ages, Our souldiers else would oft want wages, Such pleasing falshoods, wisely told. Do serve mens spirits to uphold, Spirits which fall when once they stoop; And dye when they begin to droop. 2. Chor. Then let them drop, then let them dye, Rather then live, sav'd with a lye; The higher that mens spirits mount, Reckoning on a false account, The lower they will fall to ground, When truth long hid, at last is found. 1. Chor. But if some zealous Lady tels, The news, she converts infidels, And all do credit her the better, Seconded by some great Lords letter, Who doubts reports from persons high, Do tantomount give them the lye. 2. Chor. But seeing in this factious age, All sorts themselves on sides engage, We take the leave what ere is told. Wee'l trust when 'tis thrice three daies old, No news to us doth sent so well, As when tis stale to others smell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. SCENE 1. Enter Monobius a great noise and busling within, One swears and curses aloud above all the rest. Mon. VVhose that within that rends mine Ears with oathes? Lap. Whose that without doth ask? 'twas I did swear, Enter Lapardas. And I do hope I did it with a grace. Mon. Can words so foul come from so fair a face. Lap. Oathes are the badges of magnanimity. Mon. But he's Most valiant that least useth oathes. Lap. Valour it self expires such expressions. Mon. As nature is purg'd out in excrements, Some sins with pleasure do delight the sense, Others with profit do invite the soul, Neither of these in swearing we can see Lap. 'Tis my pleasure to swear. Mon. Svvearing svvallows the hook without a bait. Lap. To speak the truth, Sir, I vvas overtaken, The Rascals did much provoke my patience. Mon. VVill you strike heaven, because earth did vex you? Lap. My tongue was bad, but yet my heart is good, Mon. But by the tongue the heart is understood. Lap. They'r Oaths of course. Mon. Course oaths they are indeed, Mon. A solemn oath I carefully observe. Mon. That's solemn which appeals to the highest judge. Lap. The tyrant custome makes me to persist, Mar. The Usurpers Custom, and you must resist it, Lap. So long prescription doth create a right, Mar. Not against him who is the Prince, Lap. For every Oath I bestow to the poor, Some money, and so re-buy my innocence. Mon. Such bargains would break you, though Indias master, Beside Heavens wounds you cannot cure with gold. Lap. My debts I pay toth'poor, heavens heirs at large: Mar. Alas they can't discharge you from your sins. Lap. Tel me what pennance I must then endure; Mon. I take no pleasure in anothers pain. Lap. What you injoyn that I intend to do. Mon. Then for the future strive to mend your fault; Lap. Habits depart slowly, which are slowly acquired. Mon. It is half done, when desired seriously, Unswear your tongue by degrees.â Lap. You will give leave, I may presume to send A curious Limner to you. Mon. For what end? Lap. Your lively picture he shall make for me, His Art shall strive to overtake nature; The frame shall be richly imbost with Gold. Mon. Alas, It never will deserve the cost. Adorn'd with all the Art the gilder can, Mon. The picture will be more worth then the man. Lap. Ile hang it by my bed, where your grave sight, M'unruly tongue will woo or fright from oaths. Mon. Set but your Maker once before your eyes, Remember him I pray, and forget me. Exit. Lap. I wonder Ducas breaks his promise, now 'Tis past eleven, but here he is. SCEN. 2. Enter Ducas. Duc. We are in a sad condition. Lap. 'Tis as good, As we deserve, who did carve for our selves This dainty bit, which we must eat or starve, Fearing we should by others be undone, We very wisely have undone our selves. Panergus now does all, we're made but stales. Duc. Curs'd be the day Andronicus came hither. Lap. Sure 'twas a night, whilst we securely slept, Fools Lullabies, and now too late awake. Duc. We did too much adore Andronicus, As if two'd pose the Heavens, as things did stand, To cure our wounds, save only by his power: Lap. 'It is the common peoples fault, or fate, 'Men to o're love, or else to hate to hell. Too greedily we did devour our hopes, Cordials may choak, if poured in too fast. Duc. I had far rather die of the disease, Then of the remedy: 'Diseases do their kinde, if they do kill, 'And ill that is expected is lesse ill; But to be kill'd by Physick.â Lap. Andronicus, Did hitch himself by inches up the Throne, We did not see him grow, but felt him groan. First, He was chosen but joynt Emperour, 'Twas then Alexius and Andronicus, (So ran all Patents) then they were transpos'd, It was Andronicus and Alexius, They took their place according to their age, The master first, then the Page followed. Duc. When I saw this, I read Alexius doom: Lap. And in my private thoughts proclaim'd him dead, 'Twas cunningly contrived and subtilly acted, Badness will blush at once to be stark naught. Men climb too't by Degrees. Duc. Let Princes stop treason before 'tis broacht, Nor let them think by granting of requests, Thereby to quiet mens ambitious minds, Such condescending to their wills, Widens their wishes, prompts their new desires, And teacheth their demands to mount still higher, Begging like sturdy men, by high-way side, VVith full intent to take it, if denide. Lap. Let us now play an happy after game, Duc. That is the worst of Plots, and best of shifts. Lap. Paleologus for certain is escaped, Hath got the Ships, and seized on the Port; He is expected with an Army of Persians, Isachius now appeareth for himself, VVith him wee'l live and dy, h'ath but one fault, He is a softly too vvell natur'd man. Duc. That circle of your vvords describes him weak Lap. No, in himself, he is able enough,â But I'm afraid ill men may inveigle him, So mild a dove can never prove an eagle. Enter Cleobulus. Here comes Cleobulus. Hovv doth the plot please you? SCENE 3. To them enter Cleobulus. Cl. The plot pleases me well, onely I wonder, Isachius would make use o'th'Persians. Our countrey men alone i'de have imployed. Duc. Why would not you have Persians brought in. Cle. Because they'r Persians, Lap. Is their name a sin. Cle. No but their nation will cause our smart, Lap. It is a nation full of bravery, They honour acts, which the rude Turks contemn, And are preservers of nobility. Cle. Their own, perchance, all other they destroy. Duc. They love us well. Cle. Because our Ancestors Deprived theirs, of the worlds Monarchy. Lap. That antiquated quarrel's quite forgot, They love us now because we hate the Turks. Cle. The cunning Ivy thus doth love the Oake, Imbrace and rob and soak i'ts moysture out, âI love not forraign aid if not supprest. âHe may turn Landlord who is now our guest. Duc. Their power wee'l bound, with politique restrictions. Cle. First we let in the sea, then raise a bank. Duc. There shall be but some few of them imploy'd, Cle. Their help then will not be considerable. And may be wholly spar'd Duc. By few, I mean. No more then we can wield and manage well. Cle. Under pretence of few, swarms will croud in. Lap. They shall command no Ports or place of strength Cle. If they have strength they will command our Ports. Lap. Weel keep them in continuall action, So either they will wast away in war, Or else when peace depart. Cle. Or else they'l stay, and share with us; Lap. Nay, when their work is done, Wee'l pay their wages, and so pack them hence. Cle. What if they have a mind to pay themselves? Duc. They'r bound from it, by solemn Articles. Cle. Power keeps no promise, cancels all conditions, I know all Persia well it stretcheth out, To th'Caspian sea, all Winter in the North. Whence with an ample compass bending South; A long the Arabick gulf 'tis parcht with heat. Lap. 'Tis wonderful that The torrid and the frozen Zone should meet, No temperate clime to keep them two asunder. Cle. I tell you truth, and think they'l ne'r forsake, Our shady groves and smiling meadows and, Return to frownings in heath, and bald-pate hills, They which did freely slice our fattest bief, Won't stoop their stomack to their hungry rise. And having learn't with us to swill in wine, They'l ne're confine their throats to water springs, I know not what you witty men may think. But twill ne'r sink unto my blockish brains, That they'l return, but if they do retire, I'le wonder at them. Exeunt omnes. SCENE 4. Enter Andronicus, and Panergus. An. You give a good account of all your business, Maria CÃ¦sarissa and her husband Shall ne're allarum me with frightful dreams, Out of my sleep more, How didst thou dispatch them, Pan. By poyson Sir, an unsuspected way. An. It picks mens souls from them by slight of hand. And steals their lives, yet never bids them stand. Pan. I brib'd her Gallen (all phisitians hold, There's no such cordials for themselves as gold) And quickly he did purge out both their lives, An. How did Asotus bear himself at's death? Pan. First he did swagger, swear, look big and bluster, And musterd up whole legions of curses. As if hee'd make the Ax turn edge therewith, But when he saw there was no remedy, His soul not stooping by degrees fell flat. From Lyon he did instantly turn Calf, First dead with fear, and then di'd by the Ax. An. What is become of Paleologus, Pan. For th'time he shifted, but shall not escape. An. Which way shall I thy diligence requite, Panergus dear Panergus. [He imbraceth him in his arms. Favour me to bestow on thee this favour, What honour office, pension, place preferment, By sea, or land, in the robe long or short Thy honesty I'm certaine will discharge All Offices alike, come ask at full, Crave it and have it whatsoe're is mine. Thy merrit not my bounty makes it thine. Pan. I nothing can deserve, nor do desire. An. Ask some reward of me I command thee. Pan. My pains are rewarded if but accepted, Onely I am ambitious of one smile Cast on me from your sacred countenance. An. By empty smiles I know that none can live, Ask me some wealth, fie fie, thou dost not know, That modestie's a courtiers greatest foe. Pan. I ever lov'd to advance my friends good, Scarce bettered my self except by chance. An. No chance but one can ever make thee better, Aside. Because you for your self will make no choise, What I choose for you, you Ile swear shall take. Pan. Welcome what e're comes from your Highness hands, An. Alas it doth not lye within my power, To lift thy heavy soul up to the sky. Yet Ile bestow my highest boone upon thee, And mount thy body nearest to the Moon, No common gibbet shall your greatness have. Such as would serve some petty pilfering thief, Loosing his life to relieve his wants. Of sweetest Fir they shall be built, and new, The cross beam painted (pitty 'tis not gilt) No sturdy hemp shall gall thy tender neck, Onely a silken twist, soft, fine and small. Pan. I hope Sir, my disservice ne're was such. (He falls on his knees. An. No but your service Sir, hath been too much, Your great deserts do daily upbraid me. Pan. Such syllables this mouth did never utter. An. That treason which your heart doth freely think, Your nose and eyes declare.â Your forehead frowns a flat rebellion, Your hands your Feet speak this, Andronicus Doth ow his Crown, his life, himself to me. Pan. No 'tis I ow my life unto your Highness, An. Then you shall pay it now, Ile take my due. Pan. I never have resisted your command, And. Nor shall you now withstand my pleasure, That hand of thine did spill two Princes bloud. Pan. I did it but to please your Highness will, And. When Princes do injoyn what is not fit, Ill you must suffer, but not ill commit, Besides I bid you slay, you poyson'd them, Pan. The things the same. And. But each particular Of this our pleasure, we will have observ'd, I charge you to revive them both again. Pan. That's past my power, but if I could I would. And. Would you revive our deadly enemies? Pan. 'Tis vain to answer where power doth oppose. And. I sent you, And will take you off betimes, Least what you have done for us, you do on us. Come necessary evil in a State. Enter Spiculator Make this mans Pass to Pluto with all speed, Hell will afford him room enough I hope, Earth yeields too small a scope for his active brain, And truly I do pity Pluto now, He will out Devil him, and usurp his place. Andronicus whispers to Spiculator, &amp; exit. Spic. Trust each Artificer in his owne Art, Hang me if I perform not my own part. SCEN. 5. Enter Panergus, and Spiculator. Pan. Pray use me kindly, we should be a kin, My mother was the daughter of a Hangman Better extracted by my Fathers side, He was a Projector. Spic. Who your grandfather? Pan. I know vvhom to call Grandfather: For Grandfather I'ad either none or all, Spic. So much of your Original Now for your end, Your Pedigree is good, but wants this vvreath. Takes the halter in his hand, and shews it. Come thou Panpharmacon of all diseases, Purges are base, vvorse vomits, blisters painful, Blood-letting cruel, glisters are immodest, This Feavers quenches, and moist Dropsies dreines, Cures Plurisies, not opening of a Vein, Stays the Vertigo, helps the the Strangury, Opens the Urine, only stops the breath. Pan. Can you thus jeer at one consign'd to death Spic. I learnt it from some Sages in our State, A hangman may well imitate a judge, Some vvhen they do begin to give sentence; First break a jest, and then the Offenders neck, But to be serious, would you have a Confessor? Pan. With all my heart. Spic. I'le send for th'Patriarch, Pan. Nay, spare your pains, for his unholiness; Hath more need to confess to me, His Conscience is so wide, 'tis none at all. Spic. Improve the little time you have to spend, Not to blame others, but to mend your self. Pan. 'Tis gravely spoken, Oh, novv for Monobius. Spic. What he who late crept from his Cell? Pan. The same, Spic. VVhose looks do carry Lent. Pan. The self same man. Spic. Mistake not. Pan. I am sure; Spic. Then be assur'd, He shall not come to be your Confessor, You would not one, shall not have the other. Wee'l teach them not to chuse, who are to crave, [He puts the Rope about his neck, Andron. enters. And. Hold Hangman thou hast acted well thy part, By all those Saints, whom truly I adore, All that I did before was but in jest. I did but try thee whether thou wert able? To be miserable with minde undaunted, I now commend thy carriage all this time, Thy courage makes thy miseries to smile. Pan. O happy eares! Oh voice more then Divine. And. Thou hast not bow'd thy soul beneath thy self, Speak freely didst thou think I was in earnest? Pan. I thought so when I seriously beheld, Your power unbounded, but when I reflected Upon your goodness, then I hop'd you jested. And. Our power revives you now out of the grave. Pan. I humbly live to meditate upon, Your mercy and my resurrection: And. His soul's exalted now sufficiently, Ile stoop him in the Zenith of his joy, He shall again dance back into the rope, No torture to the rack 'twixt fear and hope. Hangman to your work, Deaths sentence shall proceed, for all this now; Was interpos'd as a Parenthesis. Pan. Remember Sir, the oath you lately took, By all the saints whom truely you adore, An. Deep oath indeed as if that I should swear, By all the love which I do bear to thee. Pan.

He knew too much, but now hee'l tell no tales, Mens teeth grow in their graves but not their tongues, Lest I who kill'd the Serpent now should chance, Hereafter to be poyson'd by his Eggs. My next care is how to dispatch his breed, No mindful heirs shall here succeed; I love to bestow favours by leasure. And tickle men by dropping kindness slowly, But my revenge I in one instant spend. That minute which begins it, ends it too. Half doing undoes many, 'tis a sin, Not to be soundly sinful, if we once begin Ile make sure work on't, They strike in vain, That strike so that the stricken way complain. (A huge shout within. But heark Alexius my Rivals slain, That shout's the watchword; now I am secur'd, But yet I have rather chang'd then eas'd my cares, As long as that Isachius is alive. Lapardas Crato, Ducas, joyn with him, And Paleologus with his Persians. In the fag end crawls in Cleobulus; A medly plot patcht up of all ingredients, Unsuiting souls of different dispositions. Divers are their intents, their ends their aimes. But for to be my foes, their all made friends, Yet cannot joynt so close but through their rifts, I plainly did perceive their drifts long since, Fools learn from me hereafter to contrive. Your plots more private projects like to wounds, If they take air corrupt, with golden keyes. Your Cabbinet Councell easly i'le unlock, Your secret whisperings hollow in mine ears. I will prevent your plot, He most espies, Who for a time is pleas'd to shut his eyes. (Exit. SCEN. Ult. Enter Cleobulus, and Crato. Cra. O Barbarus, Barbarus, O, O, O, O, O, Cle.

Is that a wonder, 'Tis strange one dead in power surviv'd so long. And now he's gone into the Elisian shade, Who was but a meere shadow when he liv'd Cra. Andronicus and Alexius were like; CÃ¦sar and Bibulus consuls of Rome, Whereof the One did all the other drank all. Cle. Either each day Alexius did rise drunk, Or else each night he went to bed sober. I saw no difference, alwaies he the same, Habited sot. Cra. His Empress I believe; Will not for sorrow wee'p her self to Amber. Cle. She hath to cause fort. Alas she nere had leave to like, or love, It was state-reason made the marriage, Tw'as not their hearts but countries that were ti'de, Greece was the Bridegroome, and France was the Bride, Cra. There's a brave widdow for Andronicus. Cle. He is to old to wife Cra. And so he was. Too old to have the Empire. Cle. All lust in him is dead save onely his ambition. Cra. But do you hear of Isachius his plot. Cle. Tell that for news? Cra. Yea how it is detected. Cle. You jest I hope, Cra. As serious as a confessor at shrift; Cle. Why did you not tell me sooner, Cra. Do you, Long for ill news? We here it now too soon, Lapardas taken, and Isachius fled. Cle. No time to toy and talke, a minute now, Well us'd may be the ransome of our lives, Something must be resolv'd on, let us try, Old legs, which cannot go, now learn to flye, (Exeunt. Chorus consisting of two companies. 1. Chor. Come lets now open sorrows sluce, And with our passion break the Truce, Our souls no more intends to borrow Joy on the credit of too morrow. Lest that in mirth we spend one day The next doth it in mourning pay. 2. Chor. Long since we thought we were so low, That lower we could never go. Yet scarce into our woes did enter, When we conceiv'd our selves at th'center; Alas we fondly did mistake, And of the brink did bottom make. 1. Chor. All the losses we endure; Do but make us more secure, None lay luxury aside. None abate their needless pride, None a cup the more forbear: None an oath the fewer swear. 2. Chor. Yet you may observe of late, How all people do debate. Ryots, thrifty, pride, grown plain, Gluttons fast, wantons contain. Gamsters all now up do take, When the Empire lies at stake. 1. Chor. Many humbled we do see, Oh that they would humble be. It doth not our praise advance, To be starv'd to temperance. Sin to leave us doth begin, But alas we follow sin. 2. Chor. Were providence but pleas'd once more, Our peace and plenty to restore. Our lusts to charity wee'd turn. In coldest place it hot would burn, Astrea should have a new birth, And there would be an Heaven on Earth. 1. Chor. Rather the contrary we fear, They'd wicked be that wicked were The drunkard would be drunkard still. And though more Old, be no less ill, The wanton face will still be painted: Dissembling souls will still seem sainted. 2. Chor. Small hope they'l better be improv'd, When the punishment's remov'd. Who are fouler for the purge, And more wanton for the scourge; Senseless of the plague they feel, Gainst fiery rod their back is steel. Both Chor.

Speak much in little Sir, times pretious, La. I had rather little in much, lifes pretious But I obey, Here come I to receive my due desert; Noble was my extraction great my estate. Greater my pride, which to raise and maintain. I brought Andronicus to the Empire, But as a Mole I still wrought under ground. Stood by as Mute said nothing and did all, Spur'd on the posting Patriarch to odious actions, Thus did I sence my self against fortunes spight, If times did hold, my course I would shape so If times did change I hop't still to escape. But I forgot that Tyrants do intend, To slight those stairs by which they did ascend. I found my self deceiv'd too late at last, Gan to unravel what before I woav'd. Go then ye Fools idolatrize the Court; Out-child your children fondly learn to sport, With honours, bubble, pleasures painted feather, That greatness onely stands on vertue built. Tis near possest with joy, thats bought with guilt, Now spiculator play thy part, To Nature I a natural death do ow; A violent death to justice I'm indebted, Take then from me what I've no right to keep, This wretched life. Spi. I have no such warrant; I must boar out your eyes. Lap. Heavens forbid, Spi.

I pardon all the world, except my self; Fare well most glorious Sun, life of my life, The bank of light whence Moon and Stars do Borrow, Strange that thy Charriot should go down so soon, And set in this my HÃ¦misphear at noone, My woful life perhaps may last longer, But Oh my dayes are altogether past, (He binds him, bores out his eyes the surgeon claps plaisters on them.

Which shall soonest arrive all our senses, Though none stay long do supplant each other. And thus with various Mirth wee'l smother cares, Whilst polititians there looks on us; And when they read our practise burn their books, Studdy our life although (alas) in vain, T'attain unto the top of all our bliss, And yet, their best will learn to mend by ours, And so, though short of us, transcend themselves, Safety's not safe, if we be not secure, We built our greatness so as to endure, Pil'd up by Art stopt every cranny where, The shadow of a danger did appear; They'r fools who with late sorrow do repent, What early foresight easily might prevent; To late born nephews shall our Crown descend, And with the world shall our succession end.

With glowing Pincers he tormented me, Whilst that Maria Cesarissa stitch't, Hot burning needles through our painful sides: Out of Lapardas eyes two streams did flow Of blood, wherein I first did swim then sink. And waking caught this pillow for the brink. 2. Ser. Dreams are but fancies descant on the day. And. But look, look there, there's Alexius Ghost. Staring with hollow eyes he nods at me, Just o're the chair of state. 3. Ser. There's nothing Sir, And. Now, now, now, hee's remov'd into the corner, 1. Ser. 'Tis Hectors picture wrought in the hangings, And. I say it is Alexius his Ghost. 2. Ser. Your fancy Sir, of Mole-hills raises mountains. No plague is like to jealousies and fears, And.

But nuptial rites were suddenly dispatch't To a boy husband, a child wife was married, Our ages put together could not spell Thirty, too young a pair to prosper long, Happy ye milkmaids which each morn do walk Thorow the virgin dew, o're pearled grass, You sing i't'h day and sweetly sleep all night. And do injoy your undisturb'd delights, You freely may bestow your affections, Wed those whose love is high though state be low, High birth such bliss denies, fate doth refuse, Us leave to leave, or liberty to chuse. We are compell'd to like, whilst potent friends Do sacrifice our marriage to their ends. But he is gone, twere sin to wrong his Ghost, I will not blame him, and may not boast of him.

Forgive us, Heavens the while, To see a sinner weep be pleas'd to smile. Learn from us widdows how to cool your breasts, From ancient love, ere you do entertain, New thoughts for others, Scarce were we warm in bed the nuptial night. When loud alarums did affright us both; Mons was our Hymen, we took ship in vain: Cross Winds and Tydes inforc't us back again, Were this all, twere two much, but what is worst Maraptica that bold and cursed strumpet, Usurps our bed, and keeps in awe our husband. Subjects him to her will, which is his Law, Lust makes my love a stranger to his arms; Such is the Magick of her cunning charms. Blame not my pensive soul, though full of care Half an old husband is too much to spare, And yet that half more then I hope to keep, If true the Omen of my last nights sleep, Judge then, had any a more woful life; Whilst she was maid, whilst widow, whilst a wife, In brief, would you of sorrows frame a map. You'd hardly Mate-like years, with like mishap. To whom one hour of Joy did scarce betide, Though daughter to a King, twice Emperors Bride. SCEN. 9. Enter Menander wounded, and a Surgeon. Men.

This on my right side, made with push of pike, One of the Isaacan party gave to me, For th'other hack with sword, I have cause to thank, One that was of Andronicus his guard: Sur. You'd bad success. Men. As good as I deserv'd, This 'tis to be a Neuter of no side, I am drowsie. Sur. Its good to forbear sleep a while. Men. Ile rouze my self, Sur. In what state was Andronicus? Men.

Exit Surgeon. Men. Artemia, oraculous Artemia; Thou diedst Loyalties Martyr, and I live Confessor to my folly; All this before Thou propheciedst, but I would not beleeve thee; The weaker Sex sometimes speaks strongest sense; The Country life I thought an heavy Task, Cause there we saw no Revels, there no Mask This made me come again to Court, where I My self am made a Tragedy almost. Home will I hast, see me at Court again, And say who now is hurt, shall then be slain. SCEN. 10. Enter three Citizens of Constantinople, two of them having rescued the Corps of Andronicus from the fury of the People. 1. Cit. Abuse the dead! fie, fie, for shame forbear! 2. Cit. A Corps is senceless, therefore feels no pain. 3. Cit. More senceless you, that offer it this disgrace, Dead Corps cannot be hurt, but may be wrong'd. 2. Cit. To be more active, to torment his Ghost, I wish I were a Devill for his sake. 1. Cit. Your hellish wish makes you a Devil now. 3. Cit. He had a peircing eye, a Princely garbe, A winning gesture, and a charming tongue. 1. Cit. A handsom body, comely in each part: 2. Cit. A rotten soul, and a perfidious heart; 1. Cit. All have their faults. 2. Cit. All han't their villanies. 3. Cit. He did erect a Stately Hospital. 2. Cit. It will not hold half those he hath Beggars made. 1. Cit. Two glorious Churches he built and endow'd. 2. Cit. Poor recompence to wrong'd Religion, Churches to build, and pluck down Piety. 1. Cit. He made good Laws, 2. Cit. And brake them first himself; Besides himself hee'd have none other bad. 3. Cit. That was some goodness, 2. Cit. Tyrants are inforc't, Sometimes to make good Laws, not out of love To vertue, but to secure their safety, Wherein their private ends are not concern'd, Unpartial Justice there they must dispence, More safely at other times to be unjust: They'l stumble now and then on some good deeds, To render themselves passable with men. 1. Cit. He bare his torture with great patience, Even when his open'd Entrals call'd upon Tormentors bowels for compassion, Calm was his soul whilst all that tempest fell, He like a Lamb. 2. Cit. Went quietly to Hell: 1. Cit. Be charitable Sir, 2. Cit. My Charity Shall ne're destroy my judgment in such cases Think you that he hath liv'd so wickedly, With few good words stole happines at last. 3. Cit. That sigh might marry him to bliss whose force Did quite divorce his body from his soul. 2. Cit.

Beautiful burden, it adorns and loads, And with the Crown a cross is joyn'd together, Greatness and care are twins: [He kisses the crosse. Isa. This cross I kiss and welcome, not that now I first accost it, strange to me before, We were familiar alwaies from our cradle, This is my spear, my lance, my sword, my shield, Bas.

In you his Image perfectly doth shine, He sees our hands upheld, and humble hearts, [They all bow to Isachius. With these our bared heads and bended knees. This and much more from us to him is due, And him we pay in paying it to you. Omnes. Long live the Emperour Isachius! Bas. Not to instruct you what you do not know, But only minde you, what you might forget: Hear a few words. Isa. Speak on Basilius, Whilst native heat and moysture Radical, Observe their limits all the body thrives. Both suffer, if but one exceed his bounds; And all the body either burns or drowns. So tis betwixt your power, our property: They mutually receive and return strength, One to another, whilst they both agree, But if they justle once, and strive for conquest, Even that which gaineth most, doth lose at last, Not able to subsist when all's destroyed. And if that Princes should betray their trust, And justifie the wrong, and wrong the just, We bow and bear, and sigh, and sob, and suffer, Armed with prayers and Tears, But sure our sad complaints will mount up thither, Where Kings are only called to account, And in that Court which is above the skies, Subjects appeal, and Soveraigns censure lyes Isa. I cannot steal mens souls thorow their eares, Charm sturdy hearts with circles of choice words, Like to the sweet tongue of Andronicus, All which he promised wee'l strive to perform We're pleasd to binde our selves unto our Laws, And count it freedom to be so confin'd: Omn. Long live the Emperour Isachius? Cle. That shout did wake the Eccho from his Cave, Tickled with joy, the earth did seem to shake. Bas. âThus Treason for a time may strangely thrive, âQuickly grow great, but never long survive. Whilst fools mistake Heavens flouts for smiles, and think, That Nemesis is dead, which doth but sleep Till right at last revives out of his swoon Right which some storms may toss, but cannot drown, A Chorus consisting of two parts Grecian and Persian, one Gown-men, the other Sword-men. Gr. Ch. Vve marvel at your private sadnesse. Exception from the publick gladnesse. Why do you sigh, whilst we do sing, Whilst we ring bells, you hands do wring. Whilst joy all others cheeks doth Crown, Your face is clouded with a frown. Per. Ch. Alas, our case is most forlorn, Work we cannot, beg we scorn. Steal we will not, and do wonder Setled Laws allow no plunder; We have not whereunto to trust, Our hungry swords must eat the rust. Gr. Ch. There's a time for every trade, Merchants first good bargains made. Next the Lawyer did succeed, On clyents leane, they fat did feed; Silenc'd since in doleful dumps, And the souldier turn'd up trumps. Per. Ch. Turn'd up trumps; Alas in vain, To be soon turn'd down again. Had we been wise, this War to spin, To spread it broad, and lay it thin; When seven Winters had been past, Well might it more seven Summers last. Gr. Ch, Of our state you had the Creame, And have drain'd our wealthy streame; Our Coyn, our Plate, our Richest stuff, Were all devoured by your buff. And whilst you souldiers were in prime, Full well you did improve your time. Per. Ch. We could not drain your wealth profound, Whose streams so great. For it you hide in vaults so deep, Where PhÃ¦bus never dar'd to peep. O that we might so blessed be, Your wealth invisible to see. Gr. Ch. Our treasure doth not hidden lye, Under the earth, but o're the sky. Per. Ch. See you this sword, tis all our lands, Our states are fallen into our hands. The boundaries whereof you may, Eas'ly in one view survey: From Hilt to point the length doth reach. From edge to back the breadth doth stretch, You see our Lands, and this we vow Is both our ship, and shop, and plow. Gr. Ch, We should be loath that plow should thorow The GrÃ¦cian Empire make a furrow. Per. Ch. Into forraign Lands wee'l go, And teach their natives War to sow, War which may be sown full cheap. Tho it will prove dear to reap, It matters not so we have work; Be't gainst Christian, Jew, or Turk. Though we travell ner'e so far, Farewell peace and welcome War. Gr. Ch. Go pray transport your martiall arts, And ship them vnto forreign parts, Practise them on any other. So you spare this Land our Mother, Here alone let discord cease: Farewell War, and welcome Peace.
