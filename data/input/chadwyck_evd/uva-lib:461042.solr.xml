      <field name="fulltext">PROMETHEUS BOUND. TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK OF ÆSCHYLUS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">?? ???? ??? ?????????— Mimnermus. ??????? ????????? ????????— Theognis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. Although, among the various versions which have appeared of various ancient writers, we may recognise the dead, together with much of the living letter; a literal version, together with a transfusion of poetical spirit;—why should we, on that account, consider ourselves charmed away from attempting another translation? A mirror may he held in different lights by different hands; and, according to the position of those hands, will the light fall. A picture may be imitated in different ways,—by steel engraving, or stone engraving; and, according to the vocation of the artist, will the copy be. According to Dr. Bentley, Pope's translation of Homer is not Homer; it is Spondanus: he might have said, it is not even Spondanus—it is Pope. Cowper's translation is a different Homer altogether; not Spondanus, nor Pope, nor the right Homer either. We do not blame Pope and Cowper for not having faithfully represented Homer: we do not blame Pope and Cowper for being Pope and Cowper. It is the nature of the human mind to communicate its own character to whatever substance it conveys, whether it convey metaphysical impressions from itself to another mind, or literary compositions from one to another language. It is therefore desirable that the same composition should be conveyed by different minds, that the character of the medium may not be necessarily associated with the thing conveyed. All men, since Æsop's time and before it, have worn various-coloured spectacles. They cannot part with their colour, which is their individuality; but they may correct the effects of that individuality by itself. If Potter show us Æschylus through green spectacles, and another translator, though in a very inferior manner, show us Æschylus through yellow ones, it will become clear to the English reader, that green and yellow are not inherent properties of the Greek poet: and in this respect, both the English reader and the Greek poet are benefited. But the present age says, it has no need of translations from classic authors. It is, or it would be, an original age: it will not borrow thoughts with long genealogies, nor walk upon a pavé, nor wear a costume, like Queen Anne's authors and the French dramatists. Its poetry shall not be cold and polished and imitative poetry; but shall dream undreamt of dreams, and glow with an unearthly frenzy. If its dreams be noble dreams, may they be dreamt on; if its frenzy be the evidence of inspiration, “may I,” as Prometheus says, “be mad.” But let the age take heed.— There is one step from dreaming nobly to sleeping inertly; and one, from frenzy to imbecility. I do not ask, I would not obtain, that our age should be servilely imitative of any former age. Surely it may think its own thoughts and speak its own words, yet turn not away from those who have thought and spoken well. The contemplation of excellence produces excellence, if not similar, yet parallel. We do not turn from green hills and waving forests, because we build and inhabit palaces; nor do we turn towards them, that we may model them in painted wax. We make them subjects of contemplation, in order to abstract from them those ideas of beauty, afterwards embodied in our own productions; and, above all, in order to consider their and our Creator under every manifestation of his goodness and his power. All beauties, whether in nature or art, whether in physics or morals, whether in composition or abstract reasoning, are multiplied reflections, visible in different distances and under different positions, of one archetypal beauty. If we owe gratitude to Him, who created and unveiled its form, should we refuse to gaze upon those reflections? Because they rest even upon heathen scrolls, should we turn away from those scrolls? Because thorns and briers are the product of the earth, should we avert our eyes from that earth? The mind of man and the earth of man are cursed alike. But the age would not be “classical.” “O, that profaned name!” What does it mean, and what is it made to mean? It does not mean what it is made to mean: it does not mean what is necessarily regular, and polished, and unimpassioned. The ancients, especially the ancient Greeks, felt, and thought, and wrote antecedently to rules: they felt passionately, and thought daringly; and wrote because they felt and thought. Shakspeare is a more classical writer than Racine. Perhaps, of all the authors of antiquity, no one stands so forward to support this hypothesis, as Æschylus; and of all the works of Æschylus, no one stands more forward to support it, than his work of the Prometheus Bound. He is a fearless and impetuous, not a cautious and accomplished poet. His excellences could not be acquired by art, nor could his defects exist separately from genius. It would be nearly equally impossible for the mere imitator to compass either; for if we would stand in the mist, we must stand also on the mountain. His excellences consist chiefly in a vehement imaginativeness, a strong but repressed sensibility, a high tone of morality, a fervency of devotion, and a rolling energetic diction: and as sometimes his fancy rushes in, where his judgment fears to tread, and language, even the most copious and powerful of languages, writhes beneath its impetuosity; an occasional mixing of metaphor, and frequent obscurity of style, are named among his chief defects. He is pompous too, sometimes; but his pomposity has not any modern, any rigid, frigid effect. When he walks, like his actors, on cothurni, we do not say “how stiff he is!” but “how majestic!” Whether the Prometheus be, or be not, the finest production of its author, it will not, I think, be contested, that Prometheus himself is the character, in the conception and development of which, its author has concentrated his powers in the most full and efficient manner. There is more gorgeousness of imagery in the Seven Chiefs; and more power in the Eumenides; and I should tremble to oppose any one scene in Prometheus, to the Cassandra scene in Agamemnon. The learned Mr. Boyd, who, in addition to many valuable and well-known translations, Author of, among other works, Select Passages from St. Chrysostom, St. Gregory Nazianzen, and St. Basil, translated from the Greek. To produce such eloquent translations, the “judicium subtile limatumque,” the “teretes et religiosæ aures,” attributed to Middleton in Dr. Parr's Preface to Bellendenus, were necessary. But what ears must those be, who deny their sensibility to the “most excellent music” of the writings of the Fathers? We can go to Phrygia for their similitude. has furnished the public with an able version of that obscure tragedy, considers the scene in question to be “unapproached and unapproachable by any rival.” But I would rest the claims of the Prometheus upon one fulcrum, THE CONCEPTION OF CHARACTER. It is not in the usual manner of Æschylus to produce upon his canvass any very prominent figure, to which every other is made subordinate, and to which the interest of the spectator is very strongly and almost exclusively attached. Agamemnon's ?????? ??? we do not feel within our hearts. In the Seven Chiefs, there is a clear division of interest; and the reader willingly agrees with Antigone, that Polynices should be as honorably buried as Eteocles. In the Supplices, we are called upon to exercise universal charity towards fifty heroines. In the Persæ, we cannot weep with Atossa over the misfortunes of Xerxes; not even over what she most femininely considers to be his greatest misfortune—??????? ?? ??? ??????? ??????—his wearing a tattered garment. Perhaps we know more of Orestes than of any personage, always excepting Prometheus, introduced by Æschylus: and yet both in the Choëphorœ and Eumenides, we are interested in his calamities, rather from their being calamities than from their being his. But Prometheus stands eminent and alone; one of the most original, and grand, and attaching characters ever conceived by the mind of man. That conception sank deeply into the soul of Milton, and, as has been observed, rose from thence in the likeness of his Satan. But the Satan of Milton and the Prometheus of Æschylus stand upon ground as unequal, as do the sublime of sin and the sublime of virtue. Satan suffered from his ambition; Prometheus from his humanity: Satan for himself; Prometheus for mankind: Satan dared perils which he had not weighed; Prometheus devoted himself to sorrows which he had foreknown. “Better to rule in hell,” said Satan; “Better to serve this rock,” said Prometheus. But in his hell, Satan yearned to associate man; while Prometheus preferred a solitary agony: nay, he even permitted his zeal and tenderness for the peace of others, to abstract him from that agony's intenseness. Æschylus felt the force of his own portraiture: he never removes his Prometheus from the spectator's sight. The readers of Æschylus feel it: they are impatient at Io's long narrations; not because those narrations are otherwise than beautiful, but because they would hear Prometheus speak again: they are impatient even at Prometheus's prophetic replies to Io, because they would hear him speak only of Prometheus. From the moment of the first dawning of his character upon their minds, its effect is electrifying. He is silent: he disdains as much to answer the impotent and selfish compassion of Vulcan, as to murmur beneath the brutal cruelty of Strength. It was not thus that he pitied in his days of joy: it was not thus that he acted in his days of power: and his spirit is above them, and recks not of them; and when their pity and their scoffs pollute his ears no more, he pours out his impassioned sorrows to the air, and winds, and waters, and earth, and sun, whom he had never visited with benefits, and “taxed not with unkindness.” The striking nature of these, our first ideas of Prometheus, is not enfeebled by any subsequent ones. We see him daring and unflinching beneath the torturing and dishonoring hand, yet keenly alive to the torture and dishonor; for himself fearless and rash, yet for others considerate and wary; himself unpitied, yet to others pitiful. And when, at the last, he calls no longer upon the sun, and earth, and waters, from whom the Avenger is secluding him; but demands of Æther, who is rolling light to all eyes excepting his, whether he beholds how he suffers by injustice;—our hearts rise up within us, and bear witness that the suffering is indeed unjust. It is apparent with what bitter feeling the conceiver of this character must have regarded the transferred praise and love of Athens—of his country. “Are you not ashamed,” said Menander to Philemon, “to conquer me in comedy?” Such a reproach might Æschylus have used to his dramatic rival, and extracted as deep a blush as ever stained Philemon's cheek. But he did not. Silent as his own Prometheus, he left for ever the Athens on whom he had conferred the immortality of his name and works; and went to Sicily, to die. In that place of exile he wrote his epitaph instead of tragedies, calling with his dying voice on the grove of Marathon See the epitaph which is attributed to him. and the conquered Persians, as the only witnesses of his glory. “If thorns be in thy path,” saith Marcus Antoninus, Lib. viii. cap. 5. “turn aside.” But where should he turn, who would avoid the ingratitude and changefulness of man? Among those who have passed judgment upon Æschylus, it is remarkable how many have passed a similar one to that of the Athenians, when, according to Suidas, they “broke down the benches” previous to his departure for Sicily;—a phrase interpreted by Scaliger to signify a final condemnation of his work. He is “damn'd by faint praise;” by an alternate acknowledgment of his genius, and censure of his taste; and by an invidious opposition to Sophocles and Euripides. Of the three great critics of antiquity,—Longinus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Quintilian,—Dionysius alone does not measure his criticism to twice the length of his commendation. Quintilian calls him “rudis in plerisque et incompositus,” which my sense of justice almost gives me courage to call a false criticism. Longinus—Longinus!! uses similar language: —?????? ?????? ????????????? ??? ?????? ?????????? ??? ??????? ??? ?????????? ????????. Now there are, undeniably, some things in Æschylus, which, like the expressions of Callisthenes, would properly fall under the censure of Longinus, as being ??? ?????, ???? ???????. But according to every principle by which he himself could urge his immortal claim upon posterity, the Homer of criticism should have named with less of coldness and more of rapture, the Homer of dramatic poetry. With regard to the execution of this attempt, it is not necessary for me to say many words. I have rendered the iambics into blank verse, their nearest parallel; and the choral odes and other lyric intermixtures, into English lyrics, irregular and rhymed. Irregularity I imagined to be indispensable to the conveyance of any part of the effect of the original measure, of which little seems to be understood by modern critics, than that it is irregular. To the literal sense I have endeavoured to bend myself as closely as was poetically possible: but if, after all,—and it is too surely the case,—“quantum mutatus!” must be applied; may the reader say so rather sorrowfully than severely, and forgive my English for not being Greek, and myself for not being Æschylus. And will Æschylus forgive, among my many other offences against him, the grave offence of profaning his Prometheus, by attaching to it some miscellaneous poems by its translator? Will he not rather retort upon me, his chorus's strongly expressed disapprobation of unequal unions? And how can I defend myself? ???????? ??? ?? ? ???????.</field>

Prometheus, The fable of Prometheus, as narrated by Æschylus, widely differs from Hesiod's account; and since it is not drawn from any sources which we can examine, there appears to be no reason for doubting the powers of his own invention as developed upon it. All that every body has seen or imagined under the mask of Prometheus, I could not narrate here without changing this note into an essay. Sir Isaac Newton saw the nephew of Sesostris, and Le Clerc saw the grandson of Noah, and Bryant saw Noah himself, and Joannes Müller a resemblance to Job; and a great many others saw a great deal besides. But a translator is not, or at least need not be, a speculator. Vulcan, Strength Vide Theogony, vs. 385.

But for me, To bind with forceful hands a kindred god Against this tempest-riven precipice, Is what I dare not: yet, necessity Maketh me dare—neglect of Jove were awful. Oh! of sagacious Themis, sagest son, Thee loath, I loath, with chains insoluble Shall fix against this desolated rock,— Where never voice nor form of mortal man Shall meet thee friend of man—where, 'stablishëd 'Neath the fierce sun, thy brow's white flower shall fade— Star-broider'd night enshadow thee well pleased, And day disperse the morning dews again! But ever shall the present sense of woe Gnaw at thy heart; for no deliv'rer comes! Such fruit thou cullest from thy love of man! For thou a god, denying fear to gods, Gavest to mortals honor unbefit. For which things thou shalt guard this joyless rock, Erect, unslumb'ring, bending not the knee, And many wailings and unfruitful groans Shalt utter. For Jove's mind is obdurate, And ever cruel is a new-made king. Strength. Amen!—Why laggest thou with vain compassion? Why hat'st thou not a god who hateth gods— Who yielded up thy glory unto men? Vul. Strong is the tie of kindred and of friendship! See the Andromache, vs. 986. ?? ???????? ??? ??????. Strength. I grant it. But how canst thou disobey The father? Doth not this affright thee more? Vul. Aye wert thou stern and full of hardihood. Strength. Because it booteth not, bewailing him; Nor labour thou for what can profit nought. Vul. Oh hateful hateful art, learn'd by mine hands! Strength. Why hate it? For in simple sooth, thine art Is not the cause of any present ill. Vul. Would that another used it! Strength. Every thing Is full of sorrow, save to rule the gods:— I have preferred Blomfield's ?????? to ???????. For none is free, save Jove. Vul. I have known that; And can in nothing contradict thy words. Strength. Why then not hasten to encompass round This god with chains, lest Jove behold thee lagging? Vul. The manacles are here. Strength. Then, seizing him, On either side his hands, with nervous might Strike with the hammer,—fix him to the rocks. Vul. The work is done, and not imperfectly. Strength. Strike with a stronger stroke, compress, relax not:— He can find ways where others find no ways. Vul. This arm is fix'd indissolubly. Strength. Now Bind fast the other—let the sophist learn He is less wise than Jove. Vul. Except Prometheus, None can upbraid me justly! Strength. Firmly fix Athwart his breast the pertinacious jaw Of adamantine wedge. Vul. Alas! alas! Prometheus, I am mourning o'er thy fate! Strength. Art thou a dastard? For the foes of Jove Mourn'st thou? Take heed, lest thou bewail thyself. Vul. A spectacle thou seest, sad to see. Strength. I see this god endure just punishment. But fetter now his sides. Vul. Necessity Compelleth this; but urge not thou too much. Strength. Yea, I will urge, and iterate mine urging— Go down, and forcibly enchain his limbs. Vul. 'Tis done, and by no lengthen'd toil. Strength. And now Strongly the perforating shackles, strike— Strike thou—for he, whose work thou dost, is stern. Vul. Thy tongue speaks words as rugged as thy form. Strength. Be soft and tender thou, but me reproach not For the firm will and anger resolute. Vul. Depart we. Iron nets enfold his limbs. Strength. Here now insult! And having spoil'd the gods Of glories, bless man with them. Tell me how Thy well-loved mortals can deliver thee From all these woes. The gods have named thee falsely Prometheus the Provider, who thyself Need'st a provider for escaping hence. Prometheus alone. O holy æther, and swift-wingëd winds, And river founts, and dimples numberless Of oceanic waves—all-fost'ring earth, And, all-beholding sun, on thee I call, Behold me, what I bear—a god, from gods. Behold me, by what anguish worn, These eyes of mine shall weary turn Unto time's myriad years. So harsh a chain of suffering, Hath form'd for me heav'n's new-made king! Alas! alas! my tears Alike for present and for future flow!— Where lies the bound'ry of my mighty woe? What do I say? all things, all future things, I view unclouded; nor can sorrow come Strange to my soul. It doth behove to bear Calmly what Fate ordaineth, knowing that Necessity hath force impugnable. Yet can I not be silent, or unsilent, Of these my woes. To these necessities, Because I gave to man a glorious gift, I have been yoked—because I stole away The ferule-treasured secret fount of fire, ??? ?? ??????? ??????????????, says Hesychius. The ferule was hollow, and capable of containing fire. Teacher of every art, high help to mortals— For such sin I endure such punishment; Rock-fixëd, in the desert air, in chains. Ah me! ah me! ah me! what sound, What viewless odour hovers round? From god or man, or half divine Being, who nears this rock of mine, This limit of the earth, to see My woes, or seek—whate'er it be? View me a bound and sorrowing god, The foe of Jove, the hate of such As Jove's imperial courts have trod; Because I lovëd man too much. Ah me! ah me! what sound I hear Of coming birds! Air murm'ring sings, Beneath the soft light stroke of wings— And all society is fear. Prometheus and Chorus. Chorus. Fear nothing. Lo! This friendly train On the fast-flashing oar of pinions, Draws nigh; but scarce such boon could gain From him who holdeth sea dominions. Me too the rapid winds have borne afar. Deep thro' our caves the clank of iron came— Forth from my cheek was struck the blush of shame— And rush'd I shoonless on my wingëd car. Bishop Blomfield considers the word shoonless as being expressive of extreme haste; and he quotes several passages from ancient writers as illustrative of this view. With regard to his quotation from Bion's elegy— ??? ?????? ???????? ???????? ????????? ????????? it might be observed, with submission, that the word ????????? appears to indicate the negligence of sorrow rather than of haste. Perhaps the shoonless state of the sea-nymphs is to be attributed to an agitation arising from both causes: at least, it may be more poetical to think so. Prometheus. Ah me! ah me! ah me! Children of Tethys, who hath given birth To many, and involveth all the earth With an unsleeping sea! Daughters of old Oceanus, Behold, look on me, how constrainëd thus, By chains to this exalted rocky steep, Sad vigil I must keep. Chorus. Prometheus, I do look on thee!—but now A cloud is o'er mine eyes, A trembling cloud surcharged with many tears; When I would gaze where rock-constrainëd thou Hangest consumed by iron miseries— Because new gods th'Olympian hill obtaineth, And by new laws the son of Saturn reigneth— And past the mighty things of former years. Prometheus. Would that under earth, beneath Haïdes, the host of death, Into baseless Tartarus, He had hurl'd me shackled thus Cruelly, infrangibly! Then, neither god nor man could be Rejoicer o'er Prometheus' woes: Now, motion'd by each wind that blows, I gladden—wretched me!—my foes. Chorus. Who of the gods so stern as to be gladden'd? Who by thy fate unsadden'd? Who of the gods, save Jove? He, ever lending To wrath his soul unbending, Ruleth the heav'ns, nor e'er shall cease from ill, Until his heart be satiate, or until By fraud the sceptre's strength be wrested from his will. Prometheus. Yea! even me, albeit indeed By fetter strong consumed I lie, The ruler of the blest shall need— To show that counsel new whereby He loseth honor, sov'reignty. And honey'd, suasive words shall be, Though charm'd, no spell to soften me; Nor iron threats shall move me e'er By fear this counsel to declare, Before he break my cruel chain, And pay the price of all this pain. Chorus. Daring thou art, nor aught to bitter woe Dost yield, but speakest words too free— And fear doth vex and pierce my spirit thro'! I fear the fate attending thee, Where thou shalt voyage ere thou see The shore of grief: for none can move The will, or melt the heart of Jove. Prometheus. I know that Jove is cruel; that he hath For his sole justice, his own will. Yet shall he soft and tender be, Moved by this threaten'd ill; And calming his unconquerable wrath, He shall not hasten less than I, To concord and to amity. Cho. Remove the veil from all things, and narrate In what offences, Jove detecting thee, Imposed such cruel and dishon'ring woe. Instruct us, if th'instruction grieve thee not. Pro. Grievous to me to speak of what is past: Grievous, to speak not—each way miserable!— What time the gods their primal wrath began, And 'mid their ranks arose the mutual strife, Some eager to thrust Saturn from his throne, That Jove forsooth should fill it; some averse, Resolved that Jove should never rule the gods— Did I by wisest counsel seek to move The Titans, children of the heav'ns and earth; But fail'd in power. For all my courteous guile, Contemning with inexorable mind, They thought to lord it, without toil, by force. Oft had my mother Themis, yea, and Gaia, (Albeit one, she beareth many names) Foretold to me what future was to come; That not by fortitude or force but fraud, The victors were to vanquish. Such decree When I unfolded in mine arguments, They deignëd not to view the whole; what time Meseem'd it best of every present ill, That having won my mother to my side, I willing should assist the willing Jove— And by my counsel the Tartarean pit, Basëd in darkness, covers ancient Saturn, And with him his allies. The King of gods, Being by me so benefited, now Hath paid me back with this ill recompense; Because there lies inbred in royalty, A rank disease—distrustfulness of friends. But that which ye demand, the cause wherefrom He doth afflict me, I will render clear. What time he sate upon his father's throne, First, unto various deities he gave Gifts various, and arranged his government; But reck'd he nothing of unhappy man, Eager to rase his universal kind, And generate another; which desire None dared resist, save I: but I, with daring Interposition, rescued mortal man From sinking into hell, exterminate. Wherefrom beneath this anguish am I bent, Grievous to suffer, piteous to behold; And I who pitied man, am deem'd myself Unmeet for pity; but am harp'd on thus By Jove's fell hand, dishonor'd spectacle! Cho. Oh, iron-hearted, formëd from the rock, Is he, Prometheus, who lamenteth not Thy woes. I yearnëd, not to look on them, And, having look'd, mine heart was anguish'd. Pro. Yea; To friends I am a piteous spectacle. Cho. But didst thou not offend in more than this? Pro. I smote with blindness man's prophetic sight. Cho. What drug devising for their malady? Pro. Blind hopes I sent among them. Cho. Mighty help Thereby thou didst afford to men. Pro. Besides, I yielded them the gift of fire— Cho. And now Th'ephemerals possess the red-eyed fire— Pro. By which they shall be learn'd in many arts. Cho. For such crimes doth the hand of Jove afflict, And loosen not the chain of chastisement? Is there prescribed no limit to thy woe? Pro. No limit—none; save what seems good to him. Cho. And how will it seem good? What hope remains? Seest thou not, thou hast sinn'd? To say, thou hast, Gives me no joy, and may increase thy grief: So let that pass, and seek out thy deliv'rance. Pro. Easy for him, whose foot is free from toils Of grief, to counsel and reproach the grieved! But all these things I knew. By mine own will— By mine own will, I sinn'd—and will confess— And, aiding mortals, met with woe myself. Indeed I thought not, by such chastisement, Attenuate, against the lofty rocks, To guard this tenantless and lonely hill— Nathless bewail not o'er my present woes, But on the plain descending, what shall come, Attend, that ye may learn the perfect whole. Obey me, nymphs, obey me; labour with Him who is toiling now; for wand'ring Woe Sits at the feet of every one by turns. Chorus. Not on the loath thou dost enforce thy words, Prometheus; and with lightsome feet, Leaving my quickly-motion'd seat, Leaving the holy air, the way of birds, Anon I reach this promontory, And yearn to hear thy woful story. Prometheus, Chorus, and Oceanus. Oceanus. I come, my weary travel ending, Prometheus, unto thee; My steed's wing'd course by counsel bending; Of bridle he is free. Behold, I sorrow in thy woe! I ween that mutual kindred so Impels me; but, without our line, The fate of none would I combine With blessing, more than thine. My faithfulness thy soul will know; No flatteries false my lips attend; Then, can I serve thee, troubled thus? Thou shalt not say thou hast a friend Firmer than Oceanus. Pro. Ha! what is this? Thou, too, of my distress Comest spectator? Wherefore hast thou dared, Leaving the tides that bear thy name, the caves Rock-roof'd and self-create, to visit earth, The mother of this iron? Didst thou come To look upon my griefs, and grieve withal? Behold a spectacle!—me, friend of Jove— Me, the creator of his royalty— Beneath what torture from his hand I bow! Ocea. Prometheus, I behold, and fain would lend Thine ear my chiefest counselling, albeit Thou hast a subtle mind. Know thine own self, And change thy ways, since heav'n hath changed her king; For if thou thus eject stern arrowy words, Though far above thee the Saturnian throne, Jove may attend, and all his present wrath Beseem a very sport at chastisement. Unhappy god! what ire thou hast, expel, And seek an egress from these circling pangs. For tho' perchance my words, an olden saw May seem, Prometheus, such the recompense Attending lofty speech! But thou, in nought Abased, to sorrow yieldest not, and fain Wouldst add unto thy present, future ill! Therefore by me instruct, thou never more Wilt kick against the goad, ???? ?????? ????? ????????. This proverb occurs also, and more exactly in the words of Scripture, in the Agamemnon, vs. 1614. ???? ?????? ?? ???????. Also in Pindar, Pyth. ii. 173. and Euripides, Fragm. Peliad. seeing that Jove, Is cruel, and to none accountable. And now depart I from thee, and will strive, If aught I can, to work thy liberty. Calm thy roused soul, nor passion in thy speech! Hast thou not learnëd, who art learn'd in much, That ruin presses on the idle tongue? Pro. I honor thee, who uncompell'd, partak'st My present curse, and darest that to come. Now, rest—forget me!—thou wilt move not him: He is unmoving; rather heed thyself, Lest visiting my grief should stir his vengeance. Ocea. More subtle far thou art for others' weal, Than thine: I witness it by deeds, not words. Me moved to act, thou shalt not backward draw— Because I glory—glory, that to me The hand of Jove shall grant thy freedom's boon. Pro. Truly I praise thee, and shall ever praise; For thou hast shrunk from nought of kindness. Yet, Toil not for me; since vainly thou wilt toil, Whate'er thou toilest, profiting me nought. Be calm, and save thyself: for not because I needs must sorrow thus, my spirit wills That others should be sorrowful like me. No, in good truth; upon my heart, the fate Before the time of Elmsley, this was the opening line to a speech of Oceanus. With admirable judgment, he removed the landmark; and restored one of the sublimest passages of poetry to lips most worthy to pronounce it,—to the lips of Prometheus. Of Atlas—of my brother, weighs,—who stands Westward, upon his shoulder balancing The column of the heav'n and earth; a burden For strength gigantic. I have also seen, And pitied, by superior force subdued, The earth-born tenant of Cilician caves, Th'embattled monster, him o'the hundred heads, In a fragment of Pindar, preserved by Strabo, Typhon is represented as having only fifty heads: but it seems to be thought corrupted. See Julian's fourth letter. He is called “hundred-headed” in the 1st and 8th Pythian. Vehement Typhon, who opposed the gods, Out-hissing slaughter from his horrid jaws. Forth from his eyes the fearful splendour glared, As to annihilate the throne of Jove: But him did Jove's unsleeping arrow find, The headlong thunderbolt out-breathing fire, And smote him from his boast majestical: For stricken to the very soul, his strength Was scorch'd and thunder-blasted from him. Now A useless and immeasurable form, He lies beside the oceanic strait, Compressëd underneath Mount Ætna's roots; Upon whose highest summit Vulcan sits, Beating his iron; and from whence erupt Rivers of fire, that gnaw with savage jaws, The fair wide plains of fruitful Sicily. Such wrath doth Typhon bubble forth, with darts Hot, unapproachable, of fiery storm, Though turn'd to cinder by the bolt of Jove. But thou possessest wisdom, nor dost need My teaching: by thy knowledge save thyself. For me, I quaff this cup of present fate, Until the soul of Jove take breath from vengeance. Ocea. Therefore, Prometheus, art thou ignorant That words do med'cine the disease of wrath? Pro. Yea; if the heart they opportunely soothe, And do not sear the tumours of the soul. Ocea. For him who wisely thinks and nobly acts, Seest thou inherent punishment? Instruct me. Pro. Labour superfluous—foolishness inane! Ocea. Yet, suffer me to faint 'neath this disease Of folly, since it profits that the wise Appear unwise. Pro. This will appear my sin. Ocea. In sooth, thy counsel drives me to mine home. Pro. Lest my bewailing drive thee into wrath. Ocea. His wrath, who newly sitteth on the seat Omnipotent? Pro. Take heed, lest thou provoke Him. Ocea. O, Prometheus, thy calamity See the Medea, vs. 1200. ????? ??? ??????? ??????????. Shall be my teacher. Pro. Go; depart, preserve Thy present prudence. Ocea. Unto me forth rushing, Thou iteratest this desire: for now My flying courser beateth with his wings The wide expanse of æther, and well-pleased Would crouch within his oceanic cave. Prometheus and Chorus. Chorus. Strophe 1. I mourn thy ruin'd destinies, Prometheus! From my tender eyes A tear-distilling stream doth break, With humid fount to dew my cheek; Because Saturnius, cruel still, Ruling by his proper will, Doth the royal sceptre bear, Subversive of the gods who were. Antistrophe 1. All this land, of far extent, Deeply sighing, doth lament Thy brethren's chastisement and thine, Unworthy of an ancient line. And mortals all, who find abode On holy Asia's neighb'ring sod, Sorrow with thee, who art lying In a sorrow meet for sighing:— Strophe 2. And habitants of Colchis' land; Virgins, who untrembling stand In war; and they of Scythia's band, Who for a home earth's limit take, Round about Mæotis' lake:— Antistrophe 2. And Arabia's battle-crown, The introduction of Arabia in this place has been a wonder among critics. Butler explains it by extending its boundary; and a learned writer, in the Edinburgh Review, perhaps more satisfactorily, by limiting Æschylus's geographical information. They who 'habit in the town Lofty-pinnacled and near Caucasus—a race of fear, Thund'ring with the pointed spear. Epode. Another only Titan have I view'd, In adamantine grief by gods subdued;— Atlas,—who with eterne surpassing might, Doth groan beneath the freight Of the supernal pole. For him the tides of ocean wailing roll, And earthly caves emit a deep'ning sigh; And hell's obscure recesses sound reply; And fountains, whence the limpid rivers flow, Murmur a pitying woe. Pro. Think not that indolence or arrogance Maketh me silent thus; I gnaw mine heart With thought, contemplating mine outraged form. Yet to these newly-crownëd gods, what hand, Saving this hand, gave out the gifts of empire? Which things, I silent pass; for I would speak To you who own their knowledge. Rather hear What crimes I perpetrated touching man; How from his idiot state I made him wise And mind-possessive. Blaming him in nought, But making clear my gifts' beneficence, I will describe them. In the olden time, Men seeing, saw in vain, and did not hear The twenty-first verse of the fifth chapter of Jeremiah is suggested to us by this passage in a profane writer. The resemblance can scarcely be accidental. Hearing; but similar to shades of dreams, Long mingled all things in confusedness; Nor knew by tilëd roofs t'oppose the sun, Nor knew device of wood; but underground, Abode like sorry ants in sunless caves. To them, of winter shone no certain sign, See Apollonius Rhodius, lib. i. vs. 490. ??? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????? ?????, ???????? ??, ??? ??????? ????????. Nor yet of flow'ry spring, nor fruitful summer; But all things did they void of sapiency— Until I show'd the rising of the orbs, And mystic setting. Yea; and I devised Numbers—high art!—and letters' composition, And memory, effector of all things, And mother of the Muses: I the first Join'd unto fitting yokes enslavëd beasts, Vicarious in the greatest toils, of man; I led rein-loving coursers to the chariot, The pride of gold-abounding luxury; And none, save I, contrived the linen-wing'd, Euripides ascribes the invention of navigation to some one of the gods. See the speech of Theseus in the Supplices, from vs. 201 to 213. Euripides must have had Prometheus in his mind. Among the obligations, due from man to deity, he records— ?????? ?? ???????????? ?? ????????? ??????? ??????????, ?? ??????? ??· ? ?? ???? ????? ??? ????, ?????????? ??? ??? ?????????, ??? ???? ????????? ??????. ??????? ??????????????, ?????? ?? ???. Sophocles, in the first choral ode of his Œdipus Coloneus, ascribes the invention to Neptune. Sea-wand'ring ships, whereon the sailors ride. Now, I unhappy, who such arts devised For mortal man, myself have no device, Whereby I may escape my present woe. Cho. Thou hast endured unseemly punishment Madden'd by error; and, as leech unskill'd Who falleth sick, thou yieldest to despair, Nor findest 'mid thy drugs thy proper cure. Pro. More wilt thou wonder, having heard the rest, Touching what arts and manners I devised;— The greatest, this. Of old, were any sick, There was no help, nor esculent, nor liquid, Nor yet anointive; but men lay outworn For lack of drugs, till I declared to them The combinations of soft remedies, Whereby all sicknesses were warded off. And divination's many rules I fix'd, And first adjudged what dreams possess the mark Of revelation; and I taught them omens Hard to distinguish; and I eke defined Signs by the way, and flight of crook-claw'd birds; And which are, by their nature, fortunate, Which contrary, and what the food of each; And how among them there are mutually Loves, and societies, and enmities; The lightness of the entrails, and what hue Possessing, they contribute joy to gods— The lungs' and liver's fair variety— And having burnt fat-cover'd limbs and loins, Toward an art complex'd I led the way, And render'd clear the fiery signs, erst dark. Enough of this! What lieth underneath The bosom of the earth, the helps of man, Gold, silver, iron, copper—who can say He track'd them ere my wisdom track'd them? None! I have sure knowledge—if the boaster's part He vainly choose not. Learn in brief the whole:— All science came to mortals from Prometheus! Cho. Take heed, lest thou unfittingly assist Mortals, neglecting thy sad self. For me, I have good hope that thou, escaped from chains, Wilt put on strength, omnipotent as Jove's. Pro. Not yet—not so, doth Fate, the Perfecter, Perform these things; but having bow'd beneath Toils, griefs unnumber'd, thus I 'scape the chain. Far weaker than necessity is art. Cho. Who holds the helm of that necessity? Pro. The threefold Fates, and unforgetting Furies. Cho. Is Jove less absolute than these are? Pro. Yea; And therefore cannot 'scape what is ordain'd. Cho. What is ordain'd for Jove, except to rule? Pro. Thou mayst not hear; nor question me again. Cho. Is that which thou involv'st in mystery, Of sacred import? Pro. Of my other words Be mindful; these, 'tis not the hour to speak But to veil closely; for, preserving these, 'Scape I the anguish and the fetter's shame. Chorus. Strophe 1. O, never may almighty Jove Oppose his will to my desire! Nor e'er with sacrificial fire, Bull-consuming, sanctified, By my father's deathless tide, May I godward cease to move! Nor e'er my lips offend in pride! But may this counsel aye abide; And never from its source be dried. Antistrophe 1. 'Tis sweet, our life to lengthen out With hopes unshadow'd o'er by doubt; The soul enrichëd all the while With joys that wear a golden smile! But Titan, shudd'ring I behold thee, What time a thousand woes enfold thee With macerating power; because Thou didst not tremble at Jove's laws; But gavest, with unbending mind, Too much weal to human kind. Strophe 2. Lo! all thy gifts gave nought to thee! Where is thy help, beloved, say? What help from men who last a day? And dost thou not the weakness see, Slow, vision-like, by which is found The hood-wink'd race of mortals, bound? Man's counsels ne'er can rise above The purposed fixedness of Jove. Antistrophe 2. Prometheus, I have learn'd these things, Viewing thy ruin'd fate: Unlike that song which waved its wings Upon my lips of late; Which sweetly round the baths I sung, Hymning thy nuptial hour, When, suasive with thy presents' power, Hermione thou wedd'st, our sister young. Prometheus, Chorus, and Io. Io. What land? what habitants? and who The being that I look unto, Tempested in rock and chain? For what crime dost thou sustain Such chastisement? and, oh, declare Where have I hapless wander'd—where? Ah me! ah me! ah me! Again the gad-fly spurs me, wretched maid! Oh earth, avert the earth-born Argus' shade! I fear mine eyes should be On him, the thousand-eyed Herdsman, who walketh, looking craftily; Whom, albeit dead, the grave hath fail'd to hide; But, passing from the shades, who doggeth me, Making me wander famine-worn beside The sand-encircled sea: While undertoned his waxen reed doth keep A tune engend'ring sleep. Oh woe! oh woe! Where are, ye gods, my wand'rings wide directed? Me, in what crime, thou Jove, what crime, detected, Yok'st thou to suff'ring, so, And thus to goading terror dost thou doom me Wretched and madden'd? Oh, with fire consume me, Hide me with earth, to beasts my body fling: Spurn not my prayer, oh king! Too many wand'rings on my strength have press'd, Nor know I where I shall attain to rest. Cho. What saith the hornëd virgin, hearest thou? Hermann and Elmsley, followed by Blomfield, attach this line to the preceding speech of Io: and after all, I have ventured to adhere to the old editions. It certainly does seem to me finer and more characteristic, that Io, hurried on by the vehemence of anguish, should appear to have forgotten the presence of Prometheus, than that she should give utterance to anguish, with the mere object of describing it to him. Bishop Blomfield observes, that in the case of this line being attributed to the Chorus, to the Chorus must also be attributed the conclusion of Io's next speech. I confess my inability to feel the full force of this remark, or indeed to see any necessary connection between the two passages. Io, in her next speech, has become aware of Prometheus's superior wisdom, and her whole object is to profit by it. Pro. How can I hear not the fly-goaded maid, The child of Inachus, who warm'd with love Saturnius' breast; and now, by Juno's hate, Is forced to tread the ever-length'ning ways? Io. Whence didst thou utter forth my father's name? Say to the sorrowing one—who canst thou be, Oh miserable thou, who dost acclaim Such true discourse to miserable me? Naming the Jove-impellëd malady, Which goads with furious sting, my strength down-sweeping; And with the hungry scourges of whose leaping, Urged wildly on, I sought this path, Subdued by Juno's wily wrath? Of those acquaint with misery, Who, alas! are sad as I? But, now what suffering waits me, plainly show; And what, oh, what, the med'cine of my woe. Speak to the wand'ring maid, if aught thou know. Pro. And plainly will I speak whate'er thou wouldst; Weaving no secret meaning, but in words Simple, as fits it to converse with friends. Thou seest Prometheus, who gave fire to mortals. Io. Oh universal help of mortal man— Sad Titan! wherefore dost thou suffer thus? Pro. I scarce have ceased bewailing o'er my woes. Io. And therefore wilt not grant this boon to me? Pro. Say what thou askest: thou mayst hear the whole. Io. Declare who 'gainst this rock hath prison'd thee. Pro. Jove's counsel, Vulcan's hand. In a fragment of the Prometheus Solutus preserved in the translation of Attius, a line occurs very similar to this:— Saturnius me sic infixit Jupiter, Jovisque numen Mulcibri ascivit manus. Io. And for what crimes Hast thou such chastisement? Pro. Enough for thee What now I have declarëd. Io. Yea: besides, To me, unhappy maiden, show what time Shall be the limit of my wanderings. Pro. Better to learn not, than to learn these things. Io. Conceal not from me that which I shall suffer. Pro. It is not that I grudge the boon. Io. Then, wherefore Delayest thou to tell me all? Pro. Not grudging, But that I fear to wring thine heart. Io. Be not More careful for me than is grateful to me. Pro. Since thou art eager, I will speak. Then, hear me. Cho. Nay; make me also sharer in the boon. First, we would fain inquire her malady, Herself narrating her consuming woes: And be what toils remain declared by thee. Pro. Io, 'tis thine t'attend these nymphs' request; The more, because they are thy father's sisters; Since to bewail and weep one's destiny, Where it is possible to draw a tear From those who hearken, is a well-paid labour. Io. I know not why I should distrust you, nymphs; And all ye fain would learn, will I unfold In clearest speech: albeit, ev'n in speech, Touching the Jove-impellëd tempesting, And the corruption of my human form, The cause which wing'd them to me, thrills my soul: For dreams nocturnal ever 'habiting Within my virgin chamber, me beguiled With honey'd words:—‘Oh, blessed, blessed maid, Wherefore so long unwedded, when 'tis thine To meet with noblest spousals? since for thee Jove is consumëd by an arrowy love, And yearns to win thee; maiden, spurn not thou The vows of Jove; but hence to Lerne's plain, Enrich'd with flocks and ox-stalls of thy sire, That so Saturnius' eye may quench its love.’ Unhappy me! each night I was constrain'd By visions thus, until I dared narrate Unto my father the night-haunting dream. He unto Pytho sent, and to Dodona's Sagacious prophets, that he hence might learn Whereby in act or speech to please the gods— Nathless his messengers return'd, announcing Various, and dark, and mystic oracles. At length, an unambiguous answer came To Inachus, which urged him, 'monished him, T'expel me from my home and native land, That so abandon'd, I might wander on To earth's extremest verge: if he refused, It threaten'd that a fire-eyed thunderbolt Should fall from Jove t'exterminate his race. Persuaded by the Loxian prophecies, He drove me forth, and barr'd me from my home; He loath, me loath; but Jove's coercive bit Constrain'd him to the act. Immediately Perverted were my human form and mind; And, hornëd as ye see, and goaded on By pungent insect, with emadden'd leap Unto Cenchrea's pleasant wave I rush'd, And Lerne's height. Bishop Blomfield has received Canter's ?????? ?? ?????? into his text; but he mentions in a note, a conjecture, which “nuper in mentem venit,” and “magis placet,”—????? ?? ??????. It pleases me much more: it is picturesque, and varies the scene; and as we are just now looking at “Cenchrea's pleasant wave,” nobody can be solicitous about having “Lerne's fount” besides—??? ???????? ?????? ????. Butler and Scholefield retain ?????? ?????: and the latter observes in a note, that it is an allusion to the rocks hanging over Lerne. He seems, however, to doubt the accuracy of the reading. The herdsman born of earth, Argos, invincible of ire, pursued, Tracking my footsteps with his myriad eyes. Him, an unlook'd-for, instantaneous fate Deprived of life; but I, instinct with fury, Am driv'n, by scourge divine, from land to land. Thou hearest what is past. What is to come Of trouble, oh, declare, if aught thou can; Nor, pitying, flatter me with soothless words; For I would name th'ignoblest sin—deceit. Chorus. Stay, Io, stay! Alas! alas! I thought not such discourse would pass— Such strange discourse—mine ear: Nor that such sights of grief and fear, So sad to view, and hard to bear, Would chill, with double edge, my spirit through. Fate! fate! I shudder, seeing Io's woe. Pro. Too soon thou wailest, and art full of fear: Restrain thy passion, till thou hear the rest. Cho. Speak, teach! There is a charm for those who grieve, In viewing without cloud their future grief. Pro. Your former boon ye did obtain from me Lightly; for ye desired to learn her woes, Herself narrating them. Now hear the rest— What future woe, there is necessity That this young maiden should endure from Juno. And, Io, let thy soul revolve my words, That thou mayst learn where end thy wanderings. First, from this spot toward the orient sun Turning thy steps, traverse uncultured lands; And thou shalt reach the Scythian hordes who dwell On high, 'neath woven roofs, on wheelëd cars, Arm'd with far-darting bows: to whom approach not; But to the sea-resounding rocky coast Bending thy footsteps, from their clime depart. Upon the left, abide the Chalybes, Workers in iron mines, of whom beware, Because ungentle they, nor bland to strangers: And thou shalt reach Hybristes, well-named stream; Which strive not thou to pass—for hard the passage— Or ere thou come to Caucasus, of hills The most exalt, and from whose pinnacle, The river pours its strength: and having clomb His star-encount'ring summit, journey thou Along the southward way, until thou reach The Amazonian squadrons, hating man, Who now Themiscyra inhabit, round Thermodon's stream, whereby is Salmydessus The iron jaw of ocean, merciless To sailors, and the stepmother of ships. They, with glad spirits, will conduct thee on: And in the lake's close portals thou wilt find Cimmeria's isthmus, which it thee behoves To leave, and traverse the Mæotian strait: And ever among men a mighty fame Shall mark thy traversing, whence Bosphorus It shall be callëd: leaving Europe's plain, Thy feet shall stand on Asia's continent. And think ye that the tyrant of the gods Is obdurate alike in all things? He, A god, desiring union with this mortal, Hath smote her with the curse of wandering. Ah, maiden! thou hast met a cruel spouse; For all the words, which erewhile thou hast heard, Are not yet in their prologue. Io. Woe! woe! woe! Pro. Thou also dost acclaim and groan! How wilt thou, What time thou hearest thy remaining griefs? Io. Some grief remaining canst thou name to me? Pro. A tempest-troubled sea of fateful woe. Io. Then what availeth me my life? Why not Hurl myself headlong from this rigid rock; That, dashing 'gainst the plain, I may be freed From all mine anguish? Better once to die, Than suffer miserably all my days. Pro. A heavy burden, wouldst thou find my pangs, To whom the Fates have not appointed death; For death had loosed the fetter and the woe: But now before my sight there lies no bound To agony—ere Jove from empire fall. Io. But can Jove ever from dominion fall? Pro. Thou wouldst rejoice, I ween, to see that sight. Io. Why should I not, who suffer ills from Jove? Pro. Then learn, that it is even so. Io. By whom Shall he be spoil'd of his imperial sceptre? Pro. Himself will do it, by his counsel weak. Io. But how? Discover—if thou canst unharm'd. Pro. A marriage union will he form, whereof He after shall repent. Io. Divine or human? If it be utterable, speak. Pro. And wherefore Should I determine which? It is not meet That these things should be spoken. Io. Shall he then Be from his throne uprooted by his spouse? Pro. Whose son shall be his sire's superior. Io. Is there no refuge for him, from this fate? Pro. No refuge, until I from fetter freed— Io. And who shall free thee, if Jove will it not? Pro. Fate hath appointed one from thee descended. Io. How say'st thou? Shall my son deliver thee? Pro. The third in generation after ten. Bishop Blomfield has enumerated thirteen:—Epaphus, Libya, Belus, Danaus, Hypermnestra, Abas, Prœtus, Acrisius, Danae, Perseus, Electryon, Alcmena, and Hercules the Deliverer. The predicted spouse, whose son was to be superior to his father, was Thetis. In submission to the prophecy, she married Peleus instead of Jupiter, and her Achilles fulfilled it. Io. The prophecy is still obscure. Pro. Nor seek To learn thy proper woes. Io. A benefit Having foreshown me, now despoil me not. Pro. Of two discourses, I will give thee one. Io. What two? Declare; and yield the choice to me. Pro. I yield it. Choose that I should clearly name Thy future woes, or my deliverer. Cho. Vouchsafe one grace to her, and one to me; Nor do dishonor to our mutual prayers; To her narrate her future wandering; To me, who shall deliver. This I yearn for. Pro. Since ye desire it, I will question not, Narrating all ye would. Io, to thee, Thy various wand'rings I will first unfold, Which in the book-memorial of thy mind See the opening of the tenth Olymp., and Sophocles's ??? ?? ?? ?????? ???????? ???? ????? ??????. Parallel thoughts respecting the tablet of Hamlet's memory will be written upon the reader's. Do thou inscribe. What time thy steps have pass'd The strait, the boundary of continents, Toward the fire-eyed, sun-track'd orient— Daring the ocean's mighty roar, until Thou come unto Cisthenes' Gorgon plains, Where dwell the Phorcides, three ancient maids, Swan-form'd, possessive of one common eye, And single-tooth'd; on whom doth never gaze The rayëd sun, nor yet the nightly moon. And near them are their wingëd sisters three, The Gorgons, serpent-hair'd and man-abhorr'd, The Pythian priestess exclaims, in her powerful description of the Furies (vide Eumenid. vs. 48.) “????? ????????, ???? ???????? ????.” It may therefore be humbly conjectured that Gorgons had some kind of horrible family likeness to Furies;—an honor, to which the priestess will by no means admit Harpies. Whom mortal cannot look upon and live; I warn thee against such: but hearken now Unto another dreary spectacle. Beware of Jove's sharp-mouth'd, unbarking dogs, Erfurdt has justly observed, that the Greek poets have called the most fearful monsters dogs. In this place griffins are called dogs; a little further on, and in the Agamemnon, eagles are called dogs; in the Œdipus Tyrannus of Sophocles, the sphinx is called a dog; in the Hercules Furens of Euripides, the hydra is called a dog; in the Electra, both of Sophocles and Euripides, the Furies are called dogs; in Apollonius Rhodius, the Harpies are called dogs; in the Andromache of Euripides, (what a climax!) a woman is called a dog; and Synesius goes a step higher, and calls the Devil a dog: in short, Brutus did not know the strength of his own expression when he said that he would “rather be a dog.” The griffins; and the Arimaspian host, One-eyed, horse-governing, who dwell beside The gold-imbubbling wave of Pluto's stream: To whom approach not. To a distant clime Thou com'st, a dusky race, that sojourns near The fountain of the Sun, where Niger flows. Wind thou along her shores, until thou reach Cleft ground, where from the hills of Byblinus, Bishop Blomfield supposes the poet to be here speaking of the Catadupa of the Nile, where that river is precipitated from the mountains. The Nile outpours his holy, pleasant wave. He will conduct thee to the Nilean land, Triangular, whereon a long abode Fate hath ordainëd for thy sons and thee. If aught I speak obscure, or aught perplex'd, Repeat thy question, make thy knowledge clear. Behold, I have more leisure than I covet. Cho. If thou can utter aught remaining still, Or aught omitted, of her wasting woes, Say on: but if the all be now reveal'd, Yield us the pray'd-for grace thou wottest of. Pro. Her ear hath heard her wand'ring's utmost bound; And that she eke may know she heard not vainly, I will declare her toils already past, Giving this witness to my prophecies. Words multitudinous I leave, and seek The goal from whence her wand'rings first began; For thou didst wander to Molossian plains, Around sublime Dodona, where abide The seat and oracle of Jove Thesprotian; And, sign incredible! the prophet oaks, By whom, without enigma, lucidly, Hailëd thou wast as one about to be Jove's glorious bride—if thee that title charm! From thence impellëd, thou didst rush along The sea-side path to Rhea's mighty bay, Whence thou wast driv'n with wand'rings retrograde; And time shall come, when that recess of sea, Know soothly, shall be named Ionian, Memorial unto all men of thy steps. To thee these words are signals of my mind, How it views more than what is visible: But unto you, and her, I will in common Declare the rest, pursuing the same track Of previous words. There is a town, Canobus, Earth's bourne, upon the mouth and banks of Nile. There Jove will give thee back thy perfect mind, Laying upon thee in thy solitude, A hand unterrible; and namëd from That touch corrective, thou shalt bear a son To Jove, dark Epaphus, who fruit shall cull From every soil bedew'd by flowing Nile. Nathless, of generations after him The fifth in number, fifty maids, again To Argos shall return unwillingly, Flying the nuptials of their uncle's sons. They, passion'd in their souls, as hawks pursue Closely on doves, shall go to hunt a quarry They should not hunt—but Heav'n shall cross their will— And Græcia shall receive them, vanquishëd By woman war, night-guarded fortitude: For every husband, will a wife destroy, Bathing in blood her doubly-edgëd sword— Would that such nuptials graced mine enemies! One only maiden, love will melt to spare Her spouse: she shall be blunted in her purpose; Of two things, choosing one; more glad to be Unfamed for courage than pollute with blood: Who, in that land, shall bear a royal race. Long speech is needful to narrate these things Clearly. Enough, that from such seed shall spring The daring and the bow-distinguish'd, he Who shall be my deliv'rer; for e'en thus Mine ancient mother, Themis, prophesied: The how and wherefore, needeth lengthen'd speech To show, nor, learning, wouldst thou profit aught. Io. Ah me! ah me! The gangrene and insanity Which striketh to my soul, are burning: The fiery sting is pricking me; My throbbing heart my breast is spurning, And round and round mine eyes are wheeling, And from their course my steps are reeling, By frenzy's blast impell'd to motion: My tongue is all without a chain, And beat my turbid words in vain 'Gainst dreary Atè's ocean. Prometheus and Chorus. Chorus. Strophe. Wise he, who first consider'd this, And spake it with his tongue; That happier far a marriage is, Our equals form'd among: That ne'er the poor should loving be To those corrupt with luxury, Nor yet to those of high degree. Antistrophe. Never, O Parcæ, may ye view me The wedded spouse of Jove! And never may a bridegroom woo me, Of those who dwell above! Because I fear, beholding late Io's spouse-hating virgin state, Tortured by Juno with a wand'ring fate. Epode. I fear no equal unions. Never may The eyes of mightiest gods, which I can flee not, Their love upon me fling! Quenchless the strife, impassable the way! I know not what I should become; I see not How I should 'scape Saturnius' counselling. Pro. And yet, albeit absolute of mind, Jove shall wax weak. A marriage he prepares, T'accomplish which, shall hurl him power-extinct From empire's seat: and thus shall Saturn's curse In every tittle be consummated, Which cursed he, falling from his ancient throne. To Jove no refuge from adversity Can any god reveal, excepting me: I know the refuge, and the means. And now Let him reign on with boldness, confident In the supernal roar, and brandishing In both his hands the dart of fiery breath. Naught shall avail him that he should not fall— Fall shamëd, an intolerable fall. For he himself against himself prepares A foe, a portent irresistible— Devising fire t'outflash the lightning fire, And mighty sound the thunder to outroar, And shatt'ring old Neptunius' trident spear, That oceanic plague, which shaketh earth! Yea! stricken by this evil, Jove shall learn What diff'rence lies between a king and slave. Cho. In sooth, thou threat'nest Jove with what thou wouldst. Pro. With what I would, and also what will be. Cho. And must we look for one to master Jove? Pro. These chains weigh lighter than his future grief. Cho. Dost thou not fear, such daring words ejecting? Pro. What should I fear, who cannot die? Cho. But he Can visit thee with woe more dread than death. Pro. Whate'er can be accomplish'd, I foreknow. Cho. Wise are the worshippers of Adrastia. Bishop Blomfield notices this word in a learned and interesting manner in his Glossary. He observes that Adrastia is to be identified with Nemesis, the goddess of temperance; and that the Greeks, in order to avert envy, were in the habit of saying, “I do homage to Nemesis,”—???????? ??? ???????. Pro. Fear, worship, flatter—whosoever reigns! To me your reigning Jove is less than naught. Let him act on, reign on, for a brief time, E'en as he will: he will not rule us long. But, lo! I see the errand-boy of Jove,— The newly-crownëd tyrant's servile drudge: Doubtless he comes, announcing something new. Prometheus, Chorus, and Hermes. Her. Thee, sophist, who dost pass in bitterness Thy bitter woes; thee, sinner 'gainst the gods, And honorer of men, and thief of fire; Thee do I hail! Our Sire commandeth thee To say what marriage moves thy glorying, By which he shall be hurl'd from empire's seat: And this, in naught obscurely, but in all Clearly reveal; nor cast before me, Titan, Thy double paths. Thou mayst perceive that Jove Is not appeasëd by such policy. Pro. Thy words are dignified, and full of wisdom, As doth befit the menial of the gods. New gods, ye newly reign, and think forsooth T'inhabit citadels impregnable. Have I not seen two tyrants hurlëd thence? Yea! and the third, the now King, I shall see, Disgracefully and quickly. Seem I not To quail and tremble 'neath the modern gods? Far be it from my spirit! But for thee, Along the way thou camest hasten back; For naught which thou demandest shalt thou hear. Her. And yet, of old, by such audacities, Into this woe thou didst impel thyself. Pro. I would not barter—thou mayst learn that from me— My state of woe for thine of servitude. Better, I ween, to serve this rock, than be The faithful messenger of father Jove. Thus unto scoffers we retort their scoffs. Her. Thou seem'st to glory in this state of thine. Pro. I glory! Would that I could see my foes So glorying! and 'mong them I name thee. Her. Me also dost thou inculpate in aught Of thy misfortunes? Pro. In one word, I hate The universal gods, who wrongfully, For all my kindness, paid me back unkindness. Her. I hear thee raging in a mighty madness. Pro. If it be madness to abhor my foes, May I be mad! Her. If thou wert prosperous, Thou wouldst not be endurable. Pro. Alas! Her. Jove knoweth not that word. Pro. Maturing Time See Pindar's tenth Olymp. ? ?? ????????? ????? ???????? ???????? ??????. “Time, the corrector when our judgments err; The test of love, truth; sole philosopher; For all besides are sophists!” Childe Harold, Canto 4. Teacheth all things. Her. Yet thou hast learn'd no wisdom. Pro. None—since I commune with a slave like thee. Her. Of all our Sire demands, thou utt'rest nought. Pro. In very sooth, I owe him gratitude! Her. Thou tauntest me, as if I were a child. Pro. No child thou art, but weaker than a child, If thou expect to gather aught from me. Nor is there chast'ning, nor device, whereby Jove shall constrain me to reveal these things, Or ere he loosen my pernicious chains. Then let the torrid flame be headlong hurl'd: With white-wing'd snows and subterranean thunders, Let him commingle and astonish all. Nothing shall bend me, to declare by whom He will be hurlëd from dominion. Her. See now, if these things will avail thee aught. Pro. They have been all foreseen, precounsellëd. Her. Endure, vain Titan, O, at last, endure To turn a prudent brow on present pain. Pro. In vain thou chafest me with exhortation, Gataker, in his annotations on Marcus Antoninus, has many interesting observations on this idea, which he traces up to Homer. Elmsley and Blomfield endeavour to turn the wave into Prometheus instead of into Mercury; and against Morell and Butler, and the disciples of Apostolius. It is a poetical, not a grammatical question; and I cannot help thinking that poetry decides as my translation has done. As waves the rock. Admit not in thy thought That I, fear-struck by Jove, shall prove a woman, And supplicate him, loathëd as he is, With feminine upliftings of mine hands, To free me from these chains. Far be it from me! Her. It seems that I have spoken much and vainly; For nothing art thou soften'd or appeased By prayers of mine; but, gnawing at the bit, E'en as a new-yoked courser, strugglest thou, And warrest 'gainst the rein; and gath'rest strength From thy weak sophisms. But 'mong th'unwise, Weaker than nothing is self-will, self-taught. Lo! if thou be unmovëd by my words, What tempest and inevitable wave Of evil will o'erwhelm thee! First, our Sire Will cleave with thunder, and with bolted flame This pinnacle of rock, and hide thy form; And there its stony arms shall rivet thee. Having accomplish'd a long lapse of time, Thou shalt revisit light; and Jove's wing'd dog, Sanguineous, the ferocious eagle, cow'ring All day, an uninvited banqueter, The ragged garment of thy form shall rend, And make his feast upon thy dusky liver. Nor any issue to such woe expect, Or ere some god, vicarious in thy pangs, Appear, and visit unillumined hell, And the Tartarean depth caliginous. Therefore take counsel: this is not a boast, Vainly devised, but actually denounced. The lips of Jove are impotent to lie, And consummation waiteth on the word. Weigh well and ponder: thou shouldst not esteem Self-will a better guide than prudent counsel. Cho. Hermes appears to us to argue well: For he exhorts thee to deliver up Self-willedness, and seek for prudent counsel. Yield thou: the error of the wise is shame. Prometheus. This embassy he doth vociferate To me, foreknowing all. For those who hate, to injure those who hate, Not strangely doth befal. Then let the shaggy lightning be The hair of the lightning—literally. In the Agamemnon there is a great beard of light; and that of Gray's Minstrel, which streamed like a meteor, would never have done so without Æschylus. With double sharpness cast on me! Let air be lacerate with thunder, And with the savage wind's convulsion; And earth's foundations rooted under, Shudder to the blast's impulsion; And let the waters of the deep Their foam with dreadful roaring heap Along the planet's heav'nly way; And let him hurl my body low To Tartarus, impell'd to go By eddies strong of fated woe! Ye me he hath not power to slay. Hermes. Such words and counsels we may gain From those of madness-stricken brain: For what of madness seems not his? And if indeed he joy in this, Why should he loosen frenzy's chain? But ye, who in the Titan's pain Bind communion griefs, with speed From this region recede, Lest the thunder's roaring be Your blaster into idiocy. Chorus. Some other counsel, speak, advise, Whereby thou mayst persuade me aught: For this, by thy perversion, lies A thing repugnant to my thought. Wherefore dost thou counsel me To work out such iniquity? It is my will to share his fate: For traitors I have learn'd to hate— Nor any sin our being bears, More hateful to my soul than theirs. Hermes. Remember then what I foreshow; Nor, hunted by the dogs of woe, Accuse your fortunes, and maintain Jove sent you unexpected pain. Yourselves have done it. Knowingly, From guile and sudden influence free, Through your own folly have ye met The toils of Atè's mighty net. Prometheus. In deed—in word no more— From her stillness Earth is thrust! And growls the thunder's echoed roar; And glares the lightning's eddied fire; And the whirlwinds wheel the dust; And blasts of every wind outleap, Each to each with confluent ire; And air is mingled with the deep. Such fearful curses visibly Jove's right-hand impelleth hither. O, my mother's pride!—O, æther! To all light-rolling; dost thou see How I suffer wrongfully?</field>
