      <field name="fulltext">THE AGAMEMNON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE AGAMEMNON. Very many years ago I had translated parts of the Agamemnon. I have been tempted by the surpassing grandeur of the Drama, the Macbeth of antiquity, to complete the work. In the passages formerly rendered, I had generally followed the readings and interpretations of the editions in the highest estimation at that time, those of Porson (the text), SchÃ¼tz, and Blomfield. I have now consulted some of the later editions, especially the copious notes of Dr. Peile, in which are embodied much of Wellauer, Klausen, O. MÃ¼ller, and Dindorf. I have, in the many passages which are still left in great part to conjecture, adopted that sense or reading which appeared to me the best and most poetical. Possibly I may have chosen some, as most poetical and Ãschylean, which the severer scholar may question or reject. The peculiar manner and wonderful power of Ãschylus in suggesting, rather than developing or distinctly expressing, many thoughts and many images by a few pregnant and close-set words, or by an overteeming compound epithet, sometimes compel the translator, if he would not lose the full force of the poetry, to indulge in paraphrase beyond what his judgment would allow in other cases. I have abstained from looking into other translations except that of Mr. Symmons of Christ Church (1824), the Notes of which show scholarship of a very high order, and a very fine and just appreciation of the poetry of Ãschylus. If Mr. Symmons had not indulged in paraphrase to an extent, at least to me, not justifiable even in the rendering of Ãschylus, and had been gifted with a finer ear for lyric harmony, his version would have been excellent.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE WATCHMAN. Grant, O ye Gods! a respite from this toil: Night after night, this livelong year, I've sate Couched like a watch-dog on the palace roof Of Atreus' son, and viewed yon starry conclave, Those glorious dynasts of the sky, that bear Winter and summer round to mortal men. And still the signal lamp I watch, the fire That shall flame forth intelligence from Troyâ The tidings of her capture. So commands Our Queen's unfeminine soul, with hope elate. And while my night-perturbed and dew-dank couch I keep, by gentle dreams unvisited, Fear still usurps the place of sleep, nor leaves My weary eyes to close in lasting slumber. Still, as I strive to guile the unquiet nightâ Sad remedy!âwith song or carol gay, I can but weep and mourn this fatal house, Not as of old with righteous wisdom ruled. Come thou, my toils release! break forth, break forth From darkness, fiery messenger of joy! All hail, thou glory of the night! that blazest With noon-day splendour, wakening Argos up To dance and song for this thrice-blest event! What, ho! what, ho! Loud do I cry to Agamemnon's queen, Swift leaping from her bed, to shriek aloud Through all the palace her exultant hymn To this auspicious lamp, since Troy's proud walls Have fallen! So tells yon blazing beacon-fire. I the glad prelude will begin, and hail This best good fortune of our lord: the dice Could cast no luckier throw than yon bright beacon. O that this hand may grasp the gracious hand Of Argos' king, returning to his home! But peace! no more! the seal is on my lips! The palace self, could it but find a voice, Would speak from its dark walls! To the understanding I speak; to those who understand notânothing. CHORUS. Lo to the tenth year since Priam's 'vengeful foes, King Agamemnon and King Menelaus, rose, Since that twin-throned, twin-sceptred pair, Like two strong coursers in one battle-car, Saw in close ranks their kindred squadrons meet; And proud set forth the thousand-galleyed fleet; And loud and fierce their battle-clang, Like screams of angry vultures rang: They for their plunder'd brood distrest Wheel round and round the rifled nest; And high on oary wings up-borne, Their wasted toil o'er their lost fledgelings mourn. But some avenging God aboveâ Apollo, Pan, or mightiest Joveâ Hearing the shrilly-piercing cry Of those plumed wanderers of the sky, Sends down the avenging Fury dread To blast the spoiler's guilty head. Thus highest Hospitable Jove Did the twin sons of Atreus move Against the adulterous Phrygian boy, Dooming alike to Greece and Troy For that too-often wedded wife Many a wild and wearying strife, With failing knees bowed to the dust, And lances shivering in their onward thrust. But be the issue as it may, Eternal Fate will hold its way; Nor lips that pray, nor eyes that weep, Nor cups that rich libations steep, Soothe those dark Powers' relentless ire, Whose altars never flame with hallowed fire. But we, unhonour'd in our age, Unfit the glorious war to wage, Propp'd on our staves, remain alone, And drag our second childhood on. The strength in infant limbs which reigns, And that which chills our aged veins, Awakes not at the battle-cry; For age, whose leaf is sere and dry, Thin as a vision seen by day, Crawls on three feet on its decrepit way. Daughter of Tyndarus! but thou, O Clytemnestra, answer now! Are glad and glorious tidings thine? That hurrying thus from shrine to shrine; To all the Gods that guard our land Thou bid'st the votive victim stand, And fires upon the altar glow To Gods above and Gods below; And here and there to heaven flame up The blazing lamps, whose mantling cup With blameless oil is running o'er, Brought from the inmost royal store. Tell, O queen, what may be told; What our ears may hear, unfold, And calm our agonising care, That struggles still with drear despair; And now consoled by that soft light From every altar beaming bright, Sees Hope appear, and smile relief Upon our soul-consuming grief. Power is upon me now, to sing the awful sign That cross'd the warrior monarchs on their road; Heaven breathes within the 'suasive song divine, And strength through my rapt soul is pour'd abroad. The birds I sing, whose fateful flight Sent forth the twin-throned Argive might, And all the youth of Greece, a gallant crew, With spear in each avenging hand, Against the guilty Trojan land. Even at the threshold of the palace, flew The king of birds o'er either king, One black and one with snow-white wing, Rightward, on the hand that grasps the spear, Down through the glittering courts they steer, Swooping the hare's prolific brood, No more to crop its grassy food. Ring out the dolorous hymn, yet triumph still the good! But the wise seer, in his prophetic view, When he the twin-soul'd sons of Atreus saw, At once the feasters on the hares he knew, Those leaders of the host, then broke his words of awe:â âIn time old Priam's city wall Before that conquering host shall fall, And all within her towers lie waste; Her teeming wealth of man and beast Shall Fate in her dire violence destroy; May ne'er heaven's envy, like a cloud, So darken o'er that army proud, The fine-forged curb of Troy! For Artemis, with jealous ire, Beholds the winged hounds of her great sire Swooping the innocent leverets' scarce-born brood, And loathes the eagles' feast of blood. Ring out the dolorous hymn, yet triumph still the good! âSuch is that beauteous Goddess' love To the strong lion's callow brood, And all that, the green meadows wont to rove, From the full udder quaff the liquid food. O Goddess! though thy wrath reprove Those savage birds, yet turn those awful signs to good! âBut, Io PÃ¦an now I cry; May ne'er her injured deity, With adverse fleet-emprisoning blast The unpropitious sky o'ercast; Hastening that other sacrificeâ That darker sacrifice, unblest By music or by jocund feast: Whence sad domestic strife shall rise, And, dreadless of her lord, fierce woman's hate; Whose child-avenging wrath in sullen state Broods, wily housewife, in her chamber's gloom, Over that unforgotten doom.â Such were the words that Calchas clanged abroad, When crossed those ominous birds the onward road Of that twice royal brotherhood: A mingled doom Of glory and of gloom. Ring out the dolorous hymn, yet triumph still the good! Whoe'er thou art, great Power above, If that dread name thou best approve, All duly weighed I cannot find, Unburthening my o'er-loaded mind, A mightier name than that of mightiest Jove. He, that so great of old, Branched out in strength invincible and bold, Is nothing now. Who after came Before the victor sank to shame: Most wise is he who sings the all-conquering might of Jove. Jove, that great God Who taught to mortals wisdom's road; By whose eternal rule Adversity is grave instruction's school. In the calm hour of sleep Conscience, the sad remembrancer, will creep To the inmost heart, and there enforce On the reluctant spirit the wisdom of remorse. Mighty the grace of those dread deities, Throned on their judgment bench, high in the empyrean skies! Nor then did the elder chief, in sooth, Of all the Achean youth, Dare brand with blame the holy seer; When adverse fortune 'gan to veer, Emprisoning that becalmed host On Chalcis' coast, Where the heavy refluent billows roar 'Gainst Aulis' rock-bound shore. And long and long from wintry Strymon blew The weary, hungry, anchor-straining blasts, The winds that wandering seamen dearly rue, Nor spared the cables worn and groaning masts; And, lingering on in indolent delay, Slow wasted all the strength of Greece away. But when the shrill-voiced prophet 'gan proclaim That remedy more dismal and more dread, Than the drear weather blackening overhead; And spoke in Artemis' most awful name, The sons of Atreus, 'mid their armed peers, Their sceptres dashed to earth, and each broke out in tears, And thus the elder king began to say: âDire doom! to disobey the Gods' commands! More dire, my child, mine house's pride, to slay, Dabbling in virgin blood a father's hands. Alas! alas! which way to fly? As base deserter quit the host, The pride and strength of our great league all lost? Should I the storm-appeasing rite deny, Will not their wrathfullest wrath rage up and swellâ Exact the virgin's blood?âoh, would 'twere o'er and well!â So 'neath Necessity's stern yoke he passed, And his lost soul, with impious impulse veering, Surrendered to the accurst unholy blast, Warped to the dire extreme of human daring. The frenzy of affliction still Maddens, dire counsellor, man's soul to ill. So he endured to be the priest In that child-slaughtering rite unblest, The first-fruit offering of that host In fatal war for a bad woman lost. The prayers, the mute appeal to her hard sire, Her youth, her virgin beauty, Nought heeded they, the Chiefs for war on fire. So to the ministers of that dire duty (First having prayed) the father gave the sign, Like some soft kid, to lift her to the shrine. There lay she prone, Her graceful garments round her thrown; But first her beauteous mouth around Their violent bonds they wound, Lest her dread curse the fated house should smite With their rude inarticulate might. But she her saffron robe to earth let fall: The shaft of pity from her eye Transpierced that awful priesthoodâone and all. Lovely as in a picture stood she by As she would speak. Thus at her father's feasts The virgin, 'mid the revelling guests, Was wont with her chaste voice to supplicate For her dear father an auspicious fate. I saw no more! to speak more is not mine; Not unfulfilled was Chalcas lore divine. Eternal justice still will bring Wisdom out of suffering. So to the fond desire farewell, The inevitable future to foretell; 'Tis but our woe to antedate; Joint knit with joint, expands the full-formed fate. Yet at the end of these dark days May prospering weal return at length; Thus in his spirit prays He of the Apian land the sole remaining strength. Clytemnestra enters. CHORUS. I come, O Clytemnestra, to salute Thy majesty! 'Tis meet the wife to honour When vacant of its lord the kingly throne. Fain would I know, what thou hast heard, what heard not. Greet'st thou with incense some glad messenger? Yet dare I not, if silent, blame thy silence. CLYTEMNESTRA. With joyful tidings, as the proverb says, Dawns forth the Morning from her mother Night. Thou shalt hear things passing thine utmost hope: The Argive host hath taken Priam's city. CHORUS. What say'st thou? I can scarce believe thy words. CLYTEMNESTRA. The Greeks are lords of Troy! Speak I not clear? CHORUS. So great my joy, I cannot choose but weep! CLYTEMNESTRA. Thy tears bear witness to thy loyalty. CHORUS. Is the proof credible of this great fact? CLYTEMNESTRA. It is. Why not? Doth the God e'er deceive? CHORUS. Art thou beguiled by phantom shapes of dreams? CLYTEMNESTRA. I care not for the mind that's drenched in sleep. CHORUS. Hath made thee wanton some swift sudden voice? CLYTEMNESTRA. Mock'st me, as thou would mock a simple girl? CHORUS. How long is't since the ruined city fell? CLYTEMNESTRA. This day, I say, born of this very night. CHORUS. What messenger hath hither flown so swiftly? CLYTEMNESTRA. The Fire-God, kindling his bright light on Ida! Beacon to beacon fast and forward flashed, An estafette of fire, on to the rocks Of Hermes-hallowed Lemnos: from that isle Caught, thirdly, Jove-crowned Athos the red light, That broader, skimming o'er the shimmering sea, Went travelling in its strength. For our delight The pine-torch, golden-glittering like the sun, Spoke to the watchman on Macistus' height. Nor he delaying, nor by careless sleep Subdued, sent on the fiery messenger: Far o'er Euripus' tide the beacon-blaze Signalled to the Messapian sentinels. Light answering light, they sent the tidings on, Kindling into a blaze the old dry heath; And mightier still, and waning not a whit, The light leaped o'er Asopus' plain, most like The crescent moon, on to CithÃ¦ron's peak, And woke again another missive fire. Nor did the guard disdain the far-seen light, But kindled up at once a mightier flame. O'er the Gorgopian lake it flashed like lightning On the sea-beaten cliffs of Megaris; Woke up the watchman not to spare his fire, And, gathering in its unexhausted strength, The long-waving bearded flame from off the cliffs That overlook the deep Saronian gulf, As from a mirror streamed. On flashed it; reached Arachne, our close neighbouring height, and there, Not unbegotten of that bright fire on Ida, On sprang it to Atrides' palace roof. Such were the laws of those swift beacon-fires: So flash the torches on from hand to hand In the holy rite, brightest the first and last. Such is the proof and sign of victory Sent by my husband from now captured Troy. CHORUS. O woman, to the Gods ere long I'll pray. But lost in wonder at thy words of joy, Fain would I hear them, at full length, again. CLYTEMNESTRA. This day the Argives are the lords of Troy; A wild and dissonant cry rises, I ween, From all the city. Vinegar and oil, Poured in one vessel, mingle not, but stand In discord obstinate: so may be heard The voices of the conquerors and the vanquished In awful opposition. Prostrate these Over the reeking bodies of the slain, Husbands or brothers; children, cowering low O'er their dead parents, now no more to lift Their heads in freedom, wail their best beloved. Those weary with the night-wandering toil of war, Break their long fast with what the city yields, Not orderly apportioned, but as each Has drawn his lot, at feast upon the spoil. And in the palaces of captive Troy They take their ease; under the frosty heaven No more, nor shivering with the cold dank dews, Unguarded sleep they through the happy night. If reverently ye adore Troy's tutelar godsâ Gods of the vanquished land, and the holy shrinesâ Captors, ye'll not be captives in your turn. Oh, may no lawless lust our host invade, Ravening for spoil, slaves of base thirst for gain! Yet have they, ere their safe return to home, One half of their long stadium's course to run, And even if guiltless come the army back; Be there no new offence; Troy's carnage still May reek to heaven and wake the avenging Gods. These are a woman's words, may good prevail, And the swung balance in our favour turn. 'Tis this of all heaven's blessings I would choose. CHORUS. Woman, like a wise man thou speakest wisely. With these unanswerable proofs content, I gird me for thanksgiving to the Gods;â A glorious guerdon this of all our toils. CHORUS. O monarch Jove! O friendly Night, Rich in ten thousand treasures bright! That over Troy's proud towers hast cast The net of ruin strong and vast; Noneânone, may 'scapeânor young nor greatâ The meshes of all-sweeping Fate. Before great Jove I bow the knee, The god of hospitality. 'Gainst guilty Paris long ago, Uplift he held the home-drawn bowâ The bolt of fate Nor lingered late, Nor meteor-like was lost on high, Over the stars up in the sightless sky. STROPHE. They have itâJove's red shaft of wrathâ I track it on its fiery path: He decreed and it was done. Heaven marks that race from son to son (Who says the Gods of the impious take no care, Treading forbidden ground) fierce wars who dare Breathe in insufferable haughtiness, And in o'er-boiling insolent excess, Glorious beyond all good. Be mine the better part, Such as contents the wise of heart. Still moderate unendangered health. To him there is no tower of wealth Who with his scornful heel strikes down the shrine Of justice all divine. ANTISTROPHE. But that stern counsellor of fate, Persuasion, keeps her violent state. There is no remedy of worth. It is not veiledâthe light breaks forthâ That baleful star, with its disastrous rays, As the base brass by touchstone tried betrays The black withinâsince that perfidious boy, Hunting the bird down in his wanton joy, Did miserable doom to his lost city bear. (There was no God to hear the prayer.) The unjust, the author of all woe, Ever brings ruin. Paris so Defiled Atrides' hospitable house Stealing the adulterous spouse. STROPHE. Bequeathing the wild fray to her own nation Of clashing spears, and the embattled fleet, Bearing to Troy her dowryâdesolation, She glided through the gate with noiseless feet, Daring the undareable! But in their grief Deep groaned the prophets of that ancient race: âWoe to the palace! woe to its proud Chief, The bed warm with the husband's fond embrace!â Silent there she stood, Too false to honour, too fair to revile; For her, far off over the ocean flood, Yet still most lovely in her parting smile, A spectre queens it in that haunted spot. Odious, in living beauty's place, Is the cold statue's fine-wrought grace. Where speaking eyes are wanting, love is not. ANTISTROPHE. And phantasms, from his deep distress unfolding, Are ever present with their idle charms. And when that beauteous form he seems beholding, It slides away from out his clasping arms. The vision! in an instant it is gone, On light wing down the silent paths of sleep! Around that widowed heart, so mute, so lone. Such are the griefs, and griefs than these more deep To all from Greece that part For the dread warfare: Patient in her gloom, Sits Sorrow, guardian god of each sad home, And many woes pierce rankling every heart. Oh, well each knew the strong, the brave, the just, Whom they sent forth on the horrid track Of battle; and what now comes back? Their vacant armour, and a little dust! STROPHE. But Mars, who barters human lives for gold, And holds the scales in the wild war of spears, Sends home from Ilion a thin remnant cold, Saved from the pyre, too slight to waken tears: And for the warriors bold returns A few dull ashes in their fine-wrought urns. Here in sad eloquence they tell Of him most skilful in the battle's strifeâ Of him who in his glory fell, Slain for another's guilty wife. In silent murmurs low Thus speaks the general woe Against the kings of Atreus' race, In the fierce battlefield who took their place, Leaders of the avenging host. Some all along far Ilion's coast, Cut off in their young beauty's bloom, Under Troy's walls found their untimely tomb, Whom a strange hostile soil and hurried rites inhume. ANTISTROPHE. The heavy burthen of a people's curse Runs through the city, the dread debt to pay Of hoarded hate. In my soul's depths I nurse A brooding fear, midnight will not betray. The almighty Gods are never blind To the wide-wasting slaughterers of their kind. The black Erynnyes, with Time, Their awful colleague, on the topmost height Of their full pride, the men of crime, Drive backward to the abyss, where might Is none; down, deeper down, Where all things are unknown. To those whose fame resounds too loud Jove's bolt bursts blinding from the thunder-cloud. Mine be the unenvied fate, Not too wealthy, not too great. I covet not, not I, the bad renown To be the sacker of another's town, Or see, a wretched slave, the sacking of mine own. CHORUS. Through all the city the glad rumour flies Of th' herald lights that flash along the skies. If true, who knows? from heaven? or but a lie? Who such a child, so 'reft of sense, To kindle at the glad intelligence; And when the change comes o'er the tidings fair, To die away in dull despair. 'Tis woman's nature foremost to descry Ere it arrives, the ill, with instinct sure The joy unripe and premature. By woman only vouched, the tale of glory Dies out at once, a soon-forgotten story. CLYTEMNESTRA. Soon shall we know of those bright flashing lights, These intercommuning red beacon-fires, If they be true, or like delusive dreams Have these joy-breathing lights the soul beguiled. I see upon yon shore a herald shaded With olive-branches; and a second witness, The thirsty dust, brother of mire, I see, Not voiceless, though he speaks not in the language Of fire-smoke on the forest mountain-tops, He with his words will ratify our joy. I loathe the thought that he will dash our hopes, And yet our dubious joy may bear increase. [Clytemnestra retires. CHORUS. May he that otherwise prays for our city Reap the sad harvest of a broken heart! The Herald enters. HERALD. Ho, native Argos! my paternal soil! Ho, my dear country! The tenth year hath dawned Since I forsook thee. After the dire wreck Of many hopes, this is at length fulfilled. I dared not dream that in this Argive land I should repose in a dear quiet grave. Hail, land beloved! all hail, thou glorious sun! Jove, our land's sovereign! and thou, Pythian king! On us no more shall shower your baleful shafts. Long, long enough upon Scamander's banks Did'st thou come, darkling in thine ire! Be now Our saviour, Lord of our high festivals! O king Apollo! All the gods I call That o'er our games preside; and chiefly thee, Our tutelar, the herald Hermes! him Whom heralds worship with devoutest love; And ye who sent us forth, the heroes old, Receive our host, all the foe's lance has spared. Ho, palace of our kings! Ho, roofs beloved! The venerable seats of justice! Gods Whose images stand glittering in the sun! Now, now, if ever, with bright-beaming eyes Welcome our king, after long years returned. He comes, King Agamemnon, like the dawn Out of the darkness; for to us, to all That host around, he brings the common joy. Greet, greet him nobly. Is't not well to greet Him who the firm foundations of old Troy Dug up with the avenging spade of Jove, Searching the soil down to its deepest roots? The altars and the temples of their gods Are all in shapeless ruin; all the seed Utterly withered from the blasted land. Such is the yoke, that o'er the towers of Troy Hath thrown that elder chieftain, Atreus' son. Blest above mortals, lo, he comes! Of men Now living, who so worthy of all honour? Paris no more, and his accomplice city Shall vaunt their proud pathetic tragedy: Of robbery and of foul ravishment Found guilty. With all-wasting Ruin's scythe Hath he mowed down his father's ancient house. Priam and his sons have double forfeit paid. CHORUS. Hail, and rejoice, herald of the Argive host! HERALD. Rejoice! Were it God's will, I'd die on the instant. CHORUS. Love of thy native land hath tried thee sore. HERALD. So that I cannot choose but weep for joy. CHORUS. Wert thou then wounded by that sweet disease? HERALD. What mean'st? Teach me to master this thy speech. CHORUS. Smitten with love of those who loved no less. HERALD. Say'st thou the city mourned us in our absence? CHORUS. With many sighs from our heart's secret depths. HERALD. Why secret was this sorrow for our host? CHORUS. Peace! Silence is the best of remedies. HERALD. Whom, when our kings were absent, did ye dread? CHORUS. Even as ye now may dread: death had been mercy. HERALD. 'Tis well! all well! in the long range of time. One man may say, things turn out right, while others Heap them with blame. Who, but the Gods in heaven, Lives through all ages without sin or woe? If I should tell our toils and weary watchings, Rare landings, sleep snatched on the hard planks. What hour Had not its dreary lot of wretchedness? On land worse sufferings than the worst at sea. Our beds were strewn under the hostile walls; And from the skies, and from the fenny land, Came dripping the chill dews, rotting our clothes, Matting our hair, like hides of shaggy beasts. Our winters shall I tell, when the bleak cold Intolerable, down from Ida's snows Came rushing; even the birds fell dead around us. Or summer heats, when on his mid-day couch Heavily fell the waveless sea, no breath Stirring the sultry air. Why grieve we now? All is gone by! the toils all o'er! the dead! No thought have they of rising from their graves. Why count the suffrages of those who have fallen? The living only, fickle fortune's wrath Afflicts with grief. I to calamity Have bid a long farewell. Of the Argive host To us, the few survivors, our rich gains Weigh down in the scale our poor uncounted losses. In the face of the noon-day sun we make our boast, Flying abroad over the sea and land, That now the Argive host hath taken Troy; And in the ancestral temples of their Gods Have nailed the spoils for our eternal glory. CHORUS. I doubt no longer, by thy words subdued. Old age is ever young to learn what's right. But these things most concern Queen Clytemnestra, Let her enjoy their glorious wealth with us. Clytemnestra enters. CLYTEMNESTRA. Already have I shrieked in my wild joy, When first the midnight fiery messenger Came telling of the fall and sack of Troy. Some girding said, âThou by those beacon-fires Deceived, believest in the ruin of Troy. 'Tis ever thus with woman, heart elate.â Deluded was I called in words like these; Yet did I order instant sacrifice: A woman gave the word; through all the city The ululation ran with holy din, Lulling the incense-fragrant fires that fed On the hecatombs in the temples of the Gods. Of this enough! from you I hear no more; My lord the king himself shall tell the rest. And I will haste, mine all-revered husband, On his return, to meet with honour due. To a wife's eye, what day so bright, so blessed, As this which sees her meet her noble lord, Under the Gods' protection home returned. Throw wide the gates of welcome, tell my lord Swiftly to come, and gladden the whole city; So in his house he'll find his faithful wife, Even as he left her, watchdog of the palace; Towards her lord of goodness unimpeached; Unloved of those alone who loved not him. Ever the same, who broke no single seal Of all his treasures in this length of time. No pleasure have I known, but thought of him; Unsullied by ill fame, as the pure brass Will take no stain or colouring from the dye. HERALD. A noble boast! truth breathes in every word; How well doth it become a high-born woman! CHORUS. For mine instruction hath she spoken thus, Clear words and plain, her soul's interpreters. But tell me, Herald! of king Menelaus Fain would I hear. Will he return in safety: He the delight and bulwark of the land? HERALD. With pleasing falsehood I will not beguile you; Brief is the joy ye reap from such deceit. CHORUS. Good news and true ye speak not both at once; Ye cannot hide the mournful contradiction. HERALD. From the Greek host one man has disappeared, He and his ship: I speak no falsehood now. CHORUS. Saw ye him first embark from Ilion? Or did one tempest scatter all the fleet? HERALD. Like a skill'd archer thou hast hit the mark, And in few words summ'd up a world of sorrow. CHORUS. What was the rumour that ran through the fleet? That he was living, or that he had perished? HERALD. There's none can know, save the all-seeing Sun, Whose light impregnates the whole teeming earth. CHORUS. By the Gods' wrath, a tempest smote the fleet; Say how it rose, and how it sank to peace. HERALD. 'Twere ill to sully an auspicious day With words of evil omen. Different Gods Have each their special honours. When there comes A messenger with hateful countenance Telling the abhorred fall of some great army, A grievous wound to the whole commonwealth, And many sons of many noble houses, Victims piacular of cruel death, Slain by that double scourge, dear to fierce Mars, The twin-spear'd Fate, the bloody battle-team. Sore over-laden by such woes as these, 'Tis meet we chant the Furies' doleful hymn. I, the blest messenger of safety, come To a glad city at high festival. Mingling ill news with good. How shall I tell The storm, not uncommissioned of Gods' wrath, That wreck'd the AchÃ¦an fleet; when those sworn foes, Water and Fire, conspired and pledged their troth Together to destroy the Argive host. At night the billows in their fury rose, Fierce blasts from Thrace against each other dash'd The barks. They, butted as by battering-rams By typhon whirlwinds and by rattling hail, By that misguiding Shepherd driven amain, Wander'd and disappear'd. But when the sun Rose glorious in his full majestic light We saw the Ãgean, like a flowery mead, With Argive corpses strew'd and drifting wrecks. But for our ship, our brave unshatter'd bark, Some God (for surely 'twas no mortal power), By stealth or by entreaty, from the jaws Of ruin rescued, governing the helm: And saviour Fortune sat upon the deck, Doing the seamen's office. To the haven, Where boil'd the sea no more, we glided in, Nor stranded on the breaker-foaming shore. How light and beautiful the day, when 'scaped The hell of that vex'd sea, mistrusting still Rude fortune, brooding o'er our bitter thoughts, Vainly we sought to guile our grief, the host All dead, and weltering in their billowy grave. And now, of these if one be breathing still, They speak of us as lost. Why not? For we, By a like fate think that they all have perished. But all be for the best! Foremost and first Look we for Menelaus' safe return. If any sun-ray bright hath search'd him out, Living and gazing on the light of day, It is the provident care of Jove on high, That will not utterly that royal race Consume. So cherish we the lingering hope, He may return to his ancestral house. Thou hast heard all; and all thou hast heard is true. CHORUS. STROPHE. Who the wondrous prophet, who With sagacious instinct true (Was it the Unseen of mortal eye, Who reads the book of destiny?) Not by chance, but wisely weening That dread name's mysterious meaning, Her Helen call'd, the fated to destroy, Ships and men and mighty Troy. The play on ?????, ???????, ????????, ?????????âthe taker of ships, men, and citiesâis of course untranslateable. The Greeks were fond of these jeux de mots, even in their most serious moods. Milton ventured to imitate them. I did not think it right therefore altogether to avoid the allusion, though of itself bare and unmeaning. I have ventured on destroy and Troy: the Hell of ships, men and cities would have been too strong. Out of her lone and close-veil'd chambers she, Curtain'd with gorgeous tapestry, Reckless, spread out her flying sail To the giant Zephyr's gale. The many hero-hunters on her track, Each his broad shield upon his back, Followed the vanishing dimpling of her oars To Simois' leaf-embowered shores; So rapid and so far, Even to the outburst of that sanguinary war. ANTISTROPHE. To Ilion in beauty came The wedded mischief! of her name The wrath of the great Gods on high Fulfilled the awful augury; The hoarded vengeance long preparing For that deed of guilty daring: Dishonour of the stranger-welcoming board, And Jove, the Hospitable God and lord. The brothers of the house, that princely throng, With the glad hymenean song, Hymned the eve of that bright wedding-day. That hymn unlearned, a sadder lay Shall Priam's ancient city chant anonâ The many-voiced wail and moan, In evil hour o'er Paris led To that disastrous bridal-bed: Foredoomed t' endure the flood For years poured wasteful of her citizens' blood. STROPHE 2. That king, within his palace nurst The dangerous lion club, at first Taking his bland and blameless feast Of innocent milk from the full breast; Gentle, with whom a child might toy; He was the old man's sport and joy; Oft in their arms, tired out with play, Like to a new-born babe he lay, Or fondly fawning would he stand And hungry licked his food from the caressing hand. ANTISTROPHE 2. Time passesâquickly he displays His ruthless kind's blood-thirsting ways: And this was the return he made, Thus the fond fostering care repaid: Upon the innocent flocks to feast Insatiate, an unbidded guest. And all the house reeks thick with blood. The unresisting servants stood Shuddering before th' unconquered beast, Heaven willed, so in that house was nursed fell Ate's priest. STROPHE 3. Too soon in Troy, her coming seemed to be Like gentle calm over the waveless sea; She stood, an image of bright wealth untold. Oblique from her soft eye the dart Preyed sweetly on the inmost heart, Making love's flower its tenderest bloom unfold. So changing with the changing hours That wedlock brought her to a bitter end, A cruel sister, and a cruel friend, To Priam's daughters in their chamber bowers: By Hospitable Jove sent in his ire, No tender bride, rather a Fury dark and dire. ANTISTROPHE 3. There is 'mong men a proverb wise and old: Enormous wealth, to its full height uproll'd, Its haughty race will ever propagate, Childless and heirless 'twill not die; Merciless unglutted misery Falls on its doomed descendants soon or late. I stand not in the thought alone, That overweening wickedness will yet High overweening wickedness beget. Be that eternal truth to some unknown; While in the mansions of the just, from age To age, goes down of bliss the unbroken heritage. STROPHE 4. For godless pride does not with years decay, And still of godless pride will bring A new, an everlasting spring On her predestined day; And still shall gorged Satiety conspire, With that dread dÃ¦mon unsubdued, High-handed and unholy Hardihood, Each of them hideous as his sire: And o'er the stately palace shall let fall Ate's funereal pall. ANTISTROPHE 4. But Justice, underneath the cottage roof, Smoke-darkened, evermore hath shone, Where decent life flows peaceful on. With backward eye, aloof Turning, she condescends not to behold The palace sprinkled o'er with gold, And foulness on the deep attainted hands; Still in her holiness she stands; No worshipper of wealth's ill-lauded power Waits calmly her last hour. Agamemnon enters. CHORUS. Hail, king of Atreus' race renowned, Who Troy hast levelled with the ground! How to address theeâhow adore; Nor with exceeding praise run o'er, Nor turning short, pass by too light The mark and standard of thy might. Most men do justice' law transgress, Being than seeming honouring less. And every one is prompt of will To groan over another's ill; So grief its prudent temperance keep, Nor sink into the heart too deep, As with mock sympathy to guile, Force on the face the unwilling smile. Who knows his sheep, the shepherd good, The eye of man will ne'er delude, Seeking his friend's blind heart to move With a faint, thin, and watery love. Thou when, for sake of Helen lost, Thou didst array that mighty host, Wert written (nought may I disguise), Within my books as most unwise, Handling with impulse rash and blind The helm of thy misguided mind. But no light-minded counsellor now To that bold army seemest thouâ The sagest and the truest friend, Who hast brought their toils to this proud end. For evermore will Time reveal Those who with prescient judgment wise, Nor missing golden opportunities, Administer for public good the public weal. AGAMEMNON. 'Tis meet that Argos and my country's Gods First I salute, gracious accomplices In my return, and the just vengeance wrought On Priam's city. The great Gods the cause Judge not from pleaders' subtle rhetoric, But cast their suffrage-balls with one consent Into the bloody urn, that doomed to ruin Ilion, to one wide slaughter all her sons; And in the opposite urn was only Hope Wild-grasping with her clenched and unfilled hands. Now captive Troy is one vast cloud of smoke; Howls Ate's hurricane, the dying embers Steam up with the fat reek of burning riches. For this our unforgetting thanks we pay To the great Gods, since we our hunters' toils With one wide sweep have o'er the city cast. The Argive dragon, for that woman's sake, Hath utterly razed to earth once famous Troy. Foaled by the fatal horse, the shielded host, At the Pleiads' setting, leaped terrific forth; The roaring lion rampant o'er the towers Sprang, glutting his fierce maw with kingly blood. Such is my prelude to the immortal Gods, But for the rest my thoughts are as your thoughts. The same aver I, and do fully assent. Few, few are born with that great gift, to hail Unenvying their friends' prosperity. Envy, slow poison gnawing at the heart Doubles the anguish of the man diseased; By his own woes weighed heavily down, he groans Gazing at the happiness before his doors. From sad experience of mankind I speak, To human life holding the mirror up. Even as the shadow of a shade I saw Those that once seemed my dearest, best of friends. Only Ulysses, who against his will Set sail, my one true yokemate, by my side Ran in the harness of the battle-car. But speak I of the living or the dead, Passes, alas! my knowledge. For the city And for our Gods holding our festal games In full assembly, take we counsel now; Take counsel how what now stands well may stand Unshaken even unto the end of time; And wheresoe'er needs healing remedy, By cautery or incision, skilful and keen, We will divert the growing slow disease. Enter we now our palace' hallowed hearths, Our Gods propitiated, who to far lands Sent us, and brought us back; and Victory, Who hath tracked our steps, abide with us for ever! Clytemnestra enters. CLYTEMNESTRA. Men! citizens! Elders of Argos' state! I blush not in your presence to pour forth All a wife's fondness for her lord beloved; For timorous bashfulness soon dies away Before familiar faces. Not from others Learning, but only from mine own sad knowledge Will I describe my solitary life, While he was far away under Troy's walls. And first, what monstrous misery to sit, A desolate woman in a lonely house! No man in the wide palace, listening still To rumours strange, confused, and contrary. First comes a melancholy messenger, Another then, with tidings worse and worse, Shrieking their dreary tale through the lone chambers: And thus poured down the news upon the houseâ âThe wounded man had had his body pierced With gaping holes as many as in a net;â Then âhe was dead,â so swelled and grew the tale, âA second triple-bodied Geryon he (Of Geryon I cannot but point out what seems to me the bearing of this most masterly touch. Clytemnestra, in her artful declamation, would seem seized with a fit of holy reticence. She will allude only to Geryon alive, not as the enemy of the gods in hell. She avoids the ill-omened comparison of Agamemnon to Geryon in hell. Throughoutâ âMethinks the lady doth protest too much.â I speak, living on earth Not Geryon in the infernal realms below)â Three deaths had suffered in his threefold form, And thence been wrapped in a winding-sheet of earth. While these conflicting rumours thronged around, Others the desperate halter round my neck, By which I hung, loosening with friendly hand, Brought me with gentle violence back to life. And all the while our boy, as had been meetâ He, seal and pledge of our affianced trothâ Orestes, was not by me. Marvel not That child, the Phocian Strophius, once our foe, Now our close friend, nurses within his palace. He the dark choice of evil that lay before me Showed, prophet-likeâthy peril 'neath Troy's walls, Or democratic anarchy at home, The senate overthrown, and the mad people, As wont with men, trampling upon the fallen. Such was the warningâwarning that deceived not. To me the gushing fountains of my tears Were utterly dried up, no drop would fall. Mine eyes grew dim upon my late-sought bed, Weeping, and watching the neglected lamps Paling their feebler light; and in my dreams I woke at the shrill buzzing of the gnats; I saw thee suffering woes more long and sad Than could be crowded in my hours of sleep. I, that have borne all this with soul unblenched, May now address my lord in happier phrase. Thou, watchdog of the unattained fold! The main-stay that secures the straining ship! The firm-based pillar, bearing the lofty roof! The only son to childless father born! Land by the lost despairing sailor seen! Day beaming beautiful after fierce storms! Cool fountain to the thirsty traveller! And, oh! what bliss to be delivered thus From the hard bondage of necessity. None grudge us now our joy! For woe enough We have endured. And now, O most beloved, Alight thou from thy chariot. Stay, nor set On the bare earth, O King, thy hallowed foot; That which hath trampled upon ruined Troy. Why tarry ye, my damsels? 'Tis your office To strew the path with gorgeous carpetings; Like purple pavement rich be all his way; That justice to his house may lead him inâ The house he little dreamed of. ?? ???? ???????. I have endeavoured faintly to preserve the untranslateable ambiguity, the terrible ambiguity, of the word ???????. What to Agamemnon seems to mean only his unhoped-for return, to the spectator hints at the unexpected reception he is to meet with. All the rest Leave to my care, that may not sleep. So please The Gods, what's justly destined shall be done. AGAMEMNON. Daughter of Leda, guardian of mine house! Of my long absence thou hast spoken well, But hast been somewhat lavish of thy praise. Praise in due measure and discreet is well, Yet may that guerdon come from others best. Treat me not like a soft and delicate woman, Nor, gazing open-mouthed, grovelling on earth Like a barbarian, raise discordant cry; Nor, strewing with bright tapestries my way, Make me an envy to all-jealous Heaven. These are the proud prerogatives of the Gods; That mortal thus should walk on rich embroideries Beseems not: do it I cannot without awe. As a man, honour me, not as a God! Though she wipe not her feet on carpetings, Nor variegated garments fine, Fame lifts High her clear voice. To be of humble mind Is God's best gift. Blessed is only he Who in unbroken happiness ends his days. Still may I prosper, thus not overbold. CLYTEMNESTRA. Say ye not so; nor cross my purpose thus. AGAMEMNON. Think not that I will change my fixed resolve. CLYTEMNESTRA. Hast thou thus sworn in awe of the great Gods? AGAMEMNON. If man e'er knew his purpose, know I mine. CLYTEMNESTRA. Had Priam conquered, what had Priam done? AGAMEMNON. He would have trod on gorgeous carpetings. CLYTEMNESTRA. So, cower not thou before the blame of men. AGAMEMNON. The people's voice bears with it mighty power. CLYTEMNESTRA. He that's not envied never is admired. AGAMEMNON. 'Tis not a woman's part to love a fray. CLYTEMNESTRA. The prosperous should condescend to yield. AGAMEMNON. Wilt thou be conqueress in this gentle strife? CLYTEMNESTRA. Be thou persuaded, yield of thine own free will! AGAMEMNON. If thou wilt have it so, then let some slave Loose instantly the sandals from my feet, Lest some dread God with jealous eye behold me Walking like them upon the sea-dipt purple. It were great shame to pamper one's own body, Trampling on riches with proud prodigal feet, And tapestries with untold silver bought. So much for this. But thou this stranger maid Lead in with courteous welcome. The high Gods On him who rules his slaves with gentleness Look gracious: for to bear the yoke of slavery Is a sore trial to the struggling will. And she, of our rich spoils the chosen flower, The army's precious gift, follows me here. And since to yield to thee I am compelled, Walking on purple, enter I the palace. CLYTEMNESTRA. Who shall go quench the prodigal sea, that still Teems with bright purple, worth its weight in silver, The ever-fresh and never-fading dye That steeps our robes in everlasting colours? Of these, O king, our house hath ample storeâ Our house that knows not vulgar poverty. Of many as rich the trampling in the dust I would have vowed, if the oracular shrine, At which I knelt, had uttered such decree, Working the ransom for thy precious life. Be the root sound, upsprings the full-leaved tree, Offering cool shade beneath the dog-star heat. So as thou cam'st to the domestic hearth, 'Twas as a sunny warmth in winter time, When Jove the sharp grape ripens to rich wine: And a delicious freshness fills the house, The prime of men moving through the long chambers. Jove! Jove! that all things perfectest, my prayers Bring to perfection! to perfection bring What thou hast yet to do! Be this thy care. CHORUS. STROPHE 1. Why, why for evermore, With irresistible control, Doth still the indwelling Terror hover o'er My portent-haunted soul? Why doth the unbought, unbidden song Its dark prophetic descant still prolong? Why does not bold Assurance, doubly sure, Scattering with orient light The dim-seen dreams of night, Take its firm seat upon my bosom's throne? Long of that time the youth hath past, Since on the sands that sea-borne host From their tall prows their anchors cast, Bound for far Ilion's coast. ANTISTROPHE 1. I've seen them homeward come, Mine own glad witness I, Yet not the less that hymn of unblest gloom, Not to the sweet lyre's harmony, But to the Erynnys' wild and wailing din, Chants, self-inspired, the secret soul within. My bowels yearn, not vainly, nor for nought (All hope is gone and lost), And in wild whirlpools tost, O'er doom to be fulfilled broods with sad thought My restless eddying heart! But oh! of all this boded ill, I pray the Gods, at least some scanty part May ne'er the Fates fulfil. STROPHE 2. Wealth in its full excess still swells Beyond all bound, insatiate; By a thin party-wall but separate, 'Neath the same roof, Disease, close neighbour, dwells. Still Fate, on the unseen breakers dark, Dashes the proud sea-going bark. The crew, as from well-balanced sling, From off the overladen deck The heavy burden of their riches fling. Yet, with calamity o'erfull, Sinks not at once the whole strong hull; Nor is the noble ship an utter wreck. With blessing from above, Still ample-handed Jove Commands the teeming furrows to repair The slow disease of the famine-stricken year. ANTISTROPHE 2. But who, with charm of potent sound Or magic spell, can summon back The human blood, all curdling thick and black, Once shed and drunk up by the thirsty ground? Jove checked the pride of the overwise Who made the dead to life arise; For if another higher fate Rebuke the fate revealed to me, Mine heart would my slow tongue anticipate; And though forbid to utter more, Its weary load would all outpour, Its dismal burthen of dark prophecy. In frenzied solitude Still silent would it brood, Nor hope the inextricable clue to unwind, Though burn the living fire in the distracted mind. Clytemnestra, Cassandra. CLYTEMNESTRA. Get thee within, Cassandra!âthee I meanâ Since Jove, not in his wrath, hath given to thee, With many another slave, to gather round The lavers of our house, and take your stand By th' altar of our treasure-guarding god. Come down, then, from the chariot: look not proud! 'Tis said that even Alcmena's son endured, Sold as a bond-slave, forced to stoop to the yoke. If fortune, then, to this necessity Hath bowed thee down, 'tis a great boon to serve The high-born lords of old ancestral wealth. The upstarts, that have reaped unhoped-for riches, Are cruel to their slaves beyond all measure. Here thou wilt have what rule and custom give. CHORUS. Clearly she speaks, and now has ceased to speak; But thou, poor captive in the toils of fate! Be well persuaded, if I may persuade thee; But haply no persuasion will prevail. CLYTEMNESTRA. If, like a chattering swallow, she speaks not Some strange barbarian tongue, I shall persuade her With words that commune with the mind within. CHORUS. Submit! the queen speaks what is best for thee. Obey, and from thy chariot-seat dismount. CLYTEMNESTRA. I have no time to waste here at the gates. Already in the central palace hall The sheep stand by the sacrificial fire; A blessing far beyond our utmost hopes! Thou, if wilt do as I command, delay not; But if thou understand'st not, make a sign Instead of speech, with thy barbarian hands. CHORUS. The stranger seems some clear interpreter To need, she looks a wild beast newly caught. CLYTEMNESTRA. She raves, or listens to some evil spirit; Who, having left but now a new-sacked city, Comes here, and champs the bit; she will not yield Till she hath foamed away her strength in blood. To a waste of words I will no more demean me. [Clytemnestra retires. CHORUS. But I have more of pity than of wrath. Come, sad one, yield! leaving the empty car, Acquaint thee with necessity's hard yoke. CASSANDRA. Alas! alas! oh woe, oh woe! Apollo! O Apollo! CHORUS. Why that alas! alas! to PhÅbus sent? No God is he that hears the shrill lament. CASSANDRA. Alas! alas! oh woe, oh woe! Apollo! O Apollo! CHORUS. Still to the God thy voice ill-omened cries, Who listens not to mortal agonies. CASSANDRA. Apollo! Apollo! My guide, my deity! Once more, destroyer, thou destroyest me! CHORUS. Of her own woes her prophet-accents rave, And still the God, the God inspires the slave. CASSANDRA. Apollo! Apollo! My guide, my deity! Whither? to what dread dwelling lead'st thou me? CHORUS. The house of Atreus' son! Dost not perceive? Trust in my words, which may not, maid, deceive. CASSANDRA. Dwelling accurst of God! Dark home of murder and infanticide! The lord lies slaughtered in that drear abode, And the dank floor with bloody dew is dyed. CHORUS. Wondrous and strange! like to the keenest hound The prophet-slave the scent of blood hath found. CASSANDRA. Woe! woe! the witnesses of murder rise! I hear the slaughtered infants' wailing cries! I see the miserable sire at feast Upon his mangled children's breast. CHORUS. Well have we heard of old thy prophet-name; Yet needs no prophet of what's known to fame. CASSANDRA. Now, now a deed they meditate, The irremediable deed of fate; He who might the stroke delay The strength of the doomed house, is far away. CHORUS. I know not now what direful deed she sings; The first I knewâof that all Argos rings. CASSANDRA. Wretch! wretch! and darest thou do the deedâ Thy lord, the partner of thy bed? Now, now the bath, I see them tend; I may not, dare not, see the end. Soon, soon it comes; I see them stand, Hand already linked in hand. CHORUS. Darker and darker now she raves along, And wrapt in riddles flows the boding song. CASSANDRA. Alas! alas! more horrors yet! God of death! I see thy net; The murderess-wife the net hath spread! Let that dark sisterhood, The Furies, all insatiate of blood, Howl for the victim, howl to death by stoning led. This seems to refer to the fate of Clytemnestra. CHORUS. To what fell power in the drear house of woe, Wilt thou we shriek aloud our frantic strain? Nor light, nor comfort, her dark accents show. To my heart the yellow blood-drop flows; As when the dying on the battle-plain Their setting days in mortal anguish close. Seest thou now some stroke of fate? CASSANDRA. Away, away, from his fell mate, Lead the lordly bull away; Entangled in his fraudful vest, Lo now they strike the black-horned beast, And in the bath the mangled corpse they lay. CHORUS. I do not boast divining skill, Yet well I bode some coming ill. For when did mystic oracle Tidings of good delight to tell? From prophets' many-worded songs we hear Only the fateful strains of fear. CASSANDRA. Alas! alas! for myself I fear Mine own death hour of agony! Oh, wherefore do ye lead me here? Oh, wherefore, but with him to die? CHORUS. Oh, thou art frantic, heaven-struck, all thy cry Strange inharmonious harmony; Thus aye incessant pours her tale. (For still the longer that she lives, More young and fresh her grief revives.) Itys! Itys! her everlasting wail, The yellow nightingale. CASSANDRA. O happy Philomel! kind heaven To her a winged form hath given, A long blest life without a tear. I, wretched I, must fall by the two-edged spear. CHORUS. Why heaven-struck, heaping ill on ill, Pour'st thou thy frantic sorrows vain? Why shrieks thy voice, ill-omened still, Its awful burthen in awakening strain? Why roams thy sad prophetic song Only the paths of grief along? CASSANDRA. Woe, Paris, woe! for thy fatal bridal-bed! Woe for Scamander's stream! of yore On that delightful shore, My joyous youth I led. By Acheron and Cocytus slow, Now my prophet strains must flow. CHORUS. Why speak'st thou thus so plain and clear, An infant might thy meaning know. Deep am I pierced by the sharp fang of fear, While sounds thy soft lament of woe, Which breaks the heart to hear. CASSANDRA. Alas! alas! For the lost city's long and weary toil, My father's vain and frequent hecatomb, His streams of sacrificial blood, That nought availed t' avert that city's doom. And I, with soul fired by the God, Must lie and perish on a foreign soil. CHORUS. Dark, dark as ever! last as first! By what dread dÃ¦mon art thou curst, That lies upon thy soul with crushing weight, Making thee sing of woe, and death, and fate? I know not yet the worst. CASSANDRA. And now no longer the dark oracle, Like a young bride, from out her close-wrapt veil Looks forth, but in bright day it breaks abroad In splendour like the dawn. How billow-like, Woe rolls on woe, each heavier than the last, In the light of heaven. Of riddles now no more! Bear ye me witness with how keen a scent I've tracked the trail of those dread deeds of old. Never shall quit that roof the direful choir, Concordant, not harmonious, whose drear tone Ne'er breathed of good. Yea, and within yon palace, Emboldened by his draughts of human blood, The ill-bidden God of revels hold his state Beside his kindred Furies. All at once Close seated round those walls accurst, they hymn That primal guilt of all, the bed of incest, A brother mounting on a brother's couch. Err I? or strike the white, an archeress true? Or am I a false wandering witch, that knocks At any door? Bear witness ye, make oath How well I know that house's ancient sins. CHORUS. What help in oaths, however deeply sworn? But much I marvel, how, far beyond sea, Nursed in a foreign city, foreign tongue, Thou speak'st of all things as if native here. CASSANDRA. Prophet Apollo made this office mine. CHORUS. What! was the God inflamed with fond desire? CASSANDRA. Till now I was ashamed to speak of this. CHORUS. Blest natures are not least to softness prone. CASSANDRA. He was my foe, yet full of breathing kindness. CHORUS. What! met ye in the gentle strife of love? CASSANDRA. By feigned consent great Loxias I deceived. CHORUS. Already gifted with divining skill? CASSANDRA. Already to the city boding woe. CHORUS. 'Scap'st thou uninjured stern Apollo's wrath? CASSANDRA. None would believe my warnings: there I failed. CHORUS. Alas! to me thou seem'st to bode too truly. CASSANDRA. Alas! alas! woe upon woe! The dire awakening toil of prophecy Whirls and distracts my soul with prelude dread. See, see ye not upon yon palace roofs Like shapes in dreams, they stand and jibber there, The children murdered by their nearest kin? Lo there they are, in their full-laden hands Entrails and bowels, horrible food, on which Their fathers have been feasting. For these deeds A terrible vengeance does the unvaliant lion That rolls about on his incestuous bed Prepare 'gainst him who on the threshold standsâ My masterâfor a slave I needs must be. He, the fleet's captain, conqueror of Troy, Observes not with what bland and glozing words, What seeming soul serene, like some dark Fate, That she-wolf welcomes him in evil hour. Such height of impious daring hers! a woman The murderer of a man! What shall I call The unloveable monster? AmphisbÃ¦na dire, Or Scylla on the rocks, the mariner's ruin, Mother of hell and priestess! 'gainst her kin Breathing implacable relentless war. How, as a conqueror in the thick of battle, Shrieked she, the all-daring woman! the while Rejoicing in his homeward safe return. If things like these win not belief, what then? What comes will come, and thou, even in this presence, Ere long wilt vouch me a true prophetess. CHORUS. That Thyestean feast of infants' flesh I understood, and shuddered, horror-struck; I heard those awful truths, not idly guess'd. For thy last words, I wander from the course. CASSANDRA. I say thou shalt behold Atrides' doom. CHORUS. Wild woman, lull thy lips to reverent silence. CASSANDRA. There's no physician can unspell my words. CHORUS. Not if it must be. Grant, Heaven, that it be not! CASSANDRA. 'Tis thine to pray, but it is theirs to murder. CHORUS. And who is he to accomplish this dark crime? CASSANDRA. Have ye so look'd askance on my dread oracles? CHORUS. By what decree 'tis to be done I see not. CASSANDRA. And yet thou knowest well the Grecian tongue. CHORUS. The Gods' words must come true! How, guess I not. CASSANDRA. Away! the fire! the fire! it leaps on me! Alas, alas! Apollo! ah me! me! She, the two-footed lioness, who sleeps With the base wolf in her adulterous bed (And he the kingly lion far away), Shall slay me, wretched me! Brewing her poison, She makes me an ingredient of her wrath; Whetting against her lord her bloody sword, My presence here she boasts that she avenges. Why wear I these in mockery of myselfâ The sceptre, on my head the prophet-garlands? Off, off! ye all shall perish ere I perish! Down with you! down to the dustâthus I requite you! Adorn, instead of me, some other wretch! Lo! lo! Apollo's self hath stripp'd from me My robes prophetic! made a show of me In these once-hallowed trappings; laughed to scorn By friends, by foesâdissentient none. How vain! No doubt, in baser and more bitter scorn, A strolling witch, a juggler, I had been call'dâ Beggar, wretch, starveling! and for thee I bore it. Prophet! thou hast undone thy prophetess, And hither leadest her to shameful death. For the altar of my sire the block awaits me, Virgil on the death of Priamâ âHoc dicens altaria ad ipsa Traxit, et in multo lapsantem sanguine nati,â etc. Ãneid, ii. 550. Where I shall be cut down, with my hot blood Spoutingâsad victim Yet I shall not die Of the great Gods unhonoured, unappeased. He comes, in his due time the Avenger comes, The matricidal son, for his sire's blood Exactor of the awful penalty. Lo, he comes back, a vagrant exile long, To his own land a stranger, to build up The topmost cornice-stone of guilt and fate; For by the Gods a mighty oath is sworn That he shall come to lift, in the face of heaven, His father's corpse, that grovels now supine. But what do I, a stranger, moaning here, Since I have seen but now proud Ilion Fall'n as it fell, and its inhabitants All perishing by the judgment of the Gods? I'll do it, I'll do itâI will endure to die; And you I do invoke, ye gates of Hell, That I encounter but one mortal stroke; So, my blood ebbing out with gentle flow, Without a struggle I may close mine eyes. CHORUS. O woefullest of women, wise as woeful! Thy speech hath wander'd far. But if in truth Thou dost foresee thy death, why, like a heifer, God-driven, to the altar dost thou boldly tread? CASSANDRA. There's no escape. What gain I by delay? CHORUS. Who lingers still wins something by delay. CASSANDRA. My day is come; flight were but little gain. CHORUS. Thou'lt suffer more by being overbold. CASSANDRA. A glorious death is mortals' noblest grace. CHORUS. The happy speak not thusâThat ne'er was heard. CASSANDRA. Oh! oh! my father! Oh thy valiant sons! CHORUS. How now! what terror makes thee thus start back? CASSANDRA. Foh! foh! CHORUS. Why this foh, foh! unless thou art sick at heart? CASSANDRA. Foh! how the house smells with the reek of blood! CHORUS. 'Tis but the smell of the sacrificial fires! CASSANDRA. It is the vapour oozing from a tomb. CHORUS. Sooth, 'tis no smell of Syrian incense rich. CASSANDRA. Well, then, I go to shriek throughout the palace Mine own and Agamemnon's bloody fate. Enough of life! enough! Strangers! good strangers! I am not screaming like a timorous bird That hides itself behind the bush, in vain! To one about to die, bear ye this witness! When that a woman dies for me a woman! A man ill-wedded for a murdered man! Remember well the expiring stranger's words. CHORUS. Sad one! I pity thy foreboded fate. CASSANDRA. Yet once more would I speak in sober speech, Or ere I utter mine own funeral wail. And thee do I conjure, all-seeing Sun! Gazing upon thy light for the last time; Even fate as terrible, as dire as this, May my avengers on my murderers wreak; On both the murderers of a dying slave, An easy victim in their mastering hand! Oh, our poor mortal state! the happiest A shadow turns to griefâthe unfortunate! A wet sponge with one touch washes all out The picture: far more pitiable these. [Enters the palace. CHORUS. Of the gifts that from good fortune fall Insatiate still are mortals all; At whom all fingers point, the great Who warns men from his palace gate, And says, âThou mayst not enter here;â To him, the monarch standing near, Did the blest Gods the boon bestow, Old Priam's city to o'erthrow. Of all the Gods we saw him come Most honoured to his native home. But if the forfeit he repays, For the foul crimes of ancient days, And vengeance for the olden dead, Be heaped on his devoted head; What mortal would not make his prayer That he were born beneath a lowlier star? AGAMEMNON (within). Woe's me, I'm stabbed! stabbed with a mortal blow! CHORUS 1. Silence! who is he that's shoutingâstricken by a mortal stroke? AGAMEMNON. Woe's me! woe's me! again; another blow. CHORUS 2. From the groaning of the monarchâseems it that the deed is done. CHORUS 3. Let us join in instant counselâwhat were safest to be done. CHORUS 4. My voice is that we raise a general cry, Summoning all Argos to the palace here. CHORUS 5. Mine that we break at once into the palace, And seize the assassin with his reeking blade. CHORUS 6. The same say I; what's to be done do quickly; This is no time for tardy dallying. CHORUS 7. 'Tis clear as dayâ'Tis the first step to slavery, The signal for a bloody tyranny. CHORUS 8. What! loitering still! haste, trample down delay, The hand of the avenger must not sleep. CHORUS 9. I know not what t' advise! were it not best 'Gainst him take counsel who hath done the deed. CHORUS 10. I'm of your mind; I know not with our cries How we can raise again the dead to life. CHORUS 11. What! shall we yield, and drag out our base lives 'Neath chiefs who so disgrace our noble house. CHORUS 12. It is not to be borne, better were death: Nobler to die, than live under a tyrant. CHORUS 13. But where our proofs? but from the groans we heard Conclude we surely that the man is dead. CHORUS 14. We must have certain knowledge of the deed Of which we speak. To guess is not to know. CHORUS. On all sides presses on me the same thought, We must know well, how 'tis with Atreus' son. CLYTEMNESTRA. Erewhile I spake words suited to the time; Of opposite and contrary import now Unblushing do I speak. His enemies Who treats as enemies, friends though they seem, Does not build up the enveloping toils of death Only so high that they may be o'erleaped. This is no unpremeditated strife: Over this ancient feud I have brooded long, That the slow time at length hath brought to pass. Here stand I, as I smote. Here, as Otfried MÃ¼ller has shown (Ãschylos Eumeniden, pp. 73, 103), the scene opened, and disclosed the bath-chamber, in the interior of the palace. Clytemnestra appeared standing over the dead body of Agamemnon. 'Twas I that slew him! Thus, thus I did it! Nought will I deny! That he could nor defend himself, nor 'scape. As round the fish the inextricable net Closes, in his rich garments' fatal wealth I wrapt him. Then once, twice, I smote him home. Twice groaned he, then stretched out his failing limbs; And as he lay I added a third blow; And unto Hades, the dark god below, Warden of the dead, made my thanksgiving vow. So, fallen thus, he breathed out his proud life, And spouted forth such a quick rush of blood, It splashed me o'er with its black gory dew. Yet not the less rejoiced I, than the flower Within the pregnant folds of its sweet cup Rejoices in the dropping dews of heaven. Being as it is, ye Argive elders all, If that ye too feel joy, rejoice with me, And I protest that were it meet to make Libations for the dead, 'tis I would make them: For all that's done is justâis more than just. He that hath filled the chalice of this house With cursing and with woe, on his return Himself should drink it to the very dregs. CHORUS. We are amazed at thy audacious tongue, Thus glorying o'er thy murdered husband's corpse. CLYTEMNESTRA. Ye try me as a woman void of sense; As to experienced men, I speak to you, With heart that knows not fear. Praise me, or blame me, 'Tis one to me. He that lies here a corpse Is Agamemnon, is my husbandâdead Even by mine hand, the righteous artisan Of this great work of death. So let it be. CHORUS. Woman! what evil food, earth-nurst, Hath maddened thee, what venomous potion From the low depths of the salt ocean, To this dire sacrifice accurst By the universal voice of men? Thou hast cast him off, Thou hast cut him off; And with one voice we sentence thee An outcast from this realm to be, The unreconciled hate of every citizen. CLYTEMNESTRA. Ye sentence me to eternal banishment, The citizens' hateâthe curses of the people. Yet not one word gainst this man did ye speak. He, rating her no more than a young lamb Chosen from all his woolly-fleeced flock, Sacrificed his own childâhis child and mineâ Most precious travail of my womb, a charm To lull the adverse Thracian winds to rest. Should ye not have driven out this cruel man To expiate the deep stain of his guilt? For judgment on my deeds, ye sit as judges Harsh and unrighteous. Yet this do I say: Threaten me, I will meet your threats with threats! Get ye the victory o'er me if you can! But if the Gods shall otherwise decree, Old men! ye'll learn in time to be more wise. CHORUS. Woman, thou art haughty-souled, With words beyond all boldness bold; And thy mind is maddening yet, With the gore distilling wet: An unavenged blood-drop lies Reddening in thine angry eyes; Still, with all thy friends away, Blow for blow wilt thou repay. CLYTEMNESTRA. And now hear ye my stern, my solemn oath:â By Justice, the avenger of my child; By AtÃª, by Erynnys, at whose shrine I have offered up this man, slain by mine hand! I look not in the house of fear to dwell, So long as on my hearth kindles his fire Ãgisthus, as of old my constant friend: He to my daring is no slender shield. Low lies the man who hath done shameful wrong To me his wife; he, once the dear delight Of the fair Chryseid, 'neath the walls of Troy; And her his captive, her his prophetess, The sharer of his bed, his soothsayer, His faithful consort on his couch of sleep, And on the deck, under the groaning masts. For this these two have paid the rightful priceâ He as ye see him; she, like the sweet swan, Singing her farewell song, her own sad dirge, Lies here, his paramour, the delicate morsel, Intruded here, where I should feast alone. SEMICHORUS. Oh, that some sudden fate, not with slow anguish, Nor making long on the sick-bed to languish, Now that is gone our gracious lord and king, To me sweet everlasting sleep would bring. What hath he borne through her, his wife, By her relentless hand bereft of life! CHORUS. Helen! O Helen! O thou frantic one! Through thee, through thee alone, How many noble lives have been o'erthrown Under the walls of Troy? SEMICHORUS. And now in this sad hour Thou'st nipped that flower of perfect graceâ That ne'er-forgotten flowerâ Through blood that nought can e'er efface. Her in that house the unsubdued strife, The bane of the great lord, hate of the jealous wife. CLYTEMNESTRA. No! pray not ye for instant fate, Under your sorrows' crushing weight; Nor heap your wrath on Helen's head, As the sole murderess of the dead; As she alone, of many Greeks laid low The Fate, had wrought all this unmeasured woe. SEMICHORUS. DÃ¦mon, who dost ever fall On the proud Tantalid hall? As thy dire presence haunted erst, All down that double line accurst; On these twain women so may come In equal share that awful doomâ The doom that eats my wretched heart away. Like some hoarse raven o'er her prey, Stands she, and o'er that corpse all desolate Hymns with shrill shriek the tuneless hymn of fate. CHORUS. SEMICHORUS. CLYTEMNESTRA. Aye, now in thy wild raving word Some sense, some meaning may be heard. Well that thrice-monstrous DÃ¦mon now, That haunts this house, invokest thou! From him that foul blood-lapping thirst Is in their greedy bowels nurst. Ere the old grief is o'er, Gushes anew the unexhausted gore. SEMICHORUS. And dar'st thou name that DÃ¦mon dread, Whose wrath hangs heavy o'er the head Of each of that predestined line; A name, the omen and the sign Of endless and insatiate misery. Alas! alas! from Jove on high, Does that avenging DÃ¦mon comeâ Jove, lord and arbiter of doom; The author and the cause of all To mortal man that can befall: For whatsoe'er on earth is done Is from the hand of Jove alone. CHORUS. Alas! alas! My king! my king! how shall I mourn for thee? How my fond heart speak all its agony? There liest thou; thy cold corpse around The subtle spider's web is wound; Thy noble life thou didst outbreathe By a most impious and unholy death. SEMICHORUS. Woe's me! woe's me! on that base bed, Unseemly for thy kingly head, Thou liest, by fraud to death trepanned By that two-edged axe held in that murderous hand. CLYTEMNESTRA. And dar'st thou say the deed was mine? Ill does thy erring speech divine. Say not 'twas Agamemnon's wife That so cut short his fated life, It was the Alastor, whose dread mien Took up the likeness of the queen. Of that dark house 'twas he, 'twas he, The curse and awful Destiny; (Where, father of that race unblest, Old Atreus held his cannibal feast;) Wreaking for that dread crime the vengeance due, The full-grown man for those poor babes he slew. SEMICHORUS. Who shall absolve thee from the guilt Of that red blood so foully spilt? How, how the Alastor wouldst thou name, Accomplice in that deed of shame? Ancient hereditary foe Of all that house of guilt and woe; (Borne on the overwhelming flood, Rushing amain, of kindred blood Like clashing tides of meeting water,) Burst Ares forth, black god of slaughter; On speeds he furious, o'er the rest, Melting the congealed gore of the child-devouring feast. CHORUS. Alas! alas! how shall I mourn for thee? How my fond heart speak all its agony? There liest thou; thy cold corpse around The subtle spider's web is wound; Thy noble life thou didst outbreathe By a most impious and unholy death. SEMICHORUS. Woe's me! woe's me! on that base bed Unseemly for a kingly head, Thou liest, by fraud to death trepanned By that two-edged axe held in that murderous hand. CLYTEMNESTRA. It was not so; that man of pride! By no unseemly death he died. Who first into our household brought Dark Ate's snares? who earliest taught That fateful lesson of deceit, Decoying forth that child of many tears, Iphigenia, in her tender years? Evil he did, evil is vengeance meet! He will not make his insolent boast in Hell; For with the sword he smote, and by the sword he fell. SEMICHORUS. In doubt, and dread, and grief I'm lost, From care to care all helpless tost; Where shall I turn? whence succour call? The whole house tottering to its fall. The showers of blood pour down amain (Ceased hath the gentle dropping rain)â Down, down with rattling noise it breaks, The palace' deep foundation quakes: Fate still her restless whetstone plies, Whetting to sharper edge her sharpest agonies. CHORUS. Woe, woe! earth, earth! will thou not swallow me Ere I am forced my kingly lord to see Within that bath, with silver walled, On his low bed unhonoured and unpalled? Oh, who will bury him? Oh, who will mourn for him? Wilt thou, wilt thou, thou daring one, presumeâ Thou, thine own husband's bloody murderess! To stand and wail as mourner by his tomb? With graceless grace, unholy holiness, For noble funeral rites the unblest offerings bless. SEMICHORUS. Who o'er the godlike man shall raise The lofty funeral chant of praise? Mingled with bitter tears of ruth, Utter from the full heart the noble truth? CLYTEMNESTRA. Speak not in this unseemly tone; 'Tis not thy care, 'tis ours alone. By us he fell, by us he died; We the fit burial will provide; But not with tears or wailing din, Without the palace and within. Him shall Iphigenia greet; His daughter! aye! for thus 'tis meet; Down by the darksome fords below, O'er the swift-flowing river of woe; And with her outspread arms embrace, And fondly kiss her father's face. CHORUS. Taunt upon taunt! mockery on mockery! These clashing sayings are too hard for me! The doer suffering still hath met, Ever the murderer pays his debt. 'Tis the iron law enrolled above, It is the fixed decree of Jove. Though time may bide, Jove bides the time; Woe's done to him who doeth crime. Who shall the old ancestral curse expel, Within this house for ever doomed to dwell? Who shall release her from her bondage state, Riveted for ever to her doleful fate? CHORUS. Woe, woe! earth, earth! wilt thou not swallow me Ere I am forced my kingly lord to see Within that bath, with silver walled, On his low bed unhonoured and unpalled? Oh, who will bury him? Oh, who will mourn for him? Wilt thou, wilt thou, thou daring one, presumeâ Thou, thine own husband's bloody murderessâ To stand and wail as mourner by his tomb? With graceless grace, unholy holiness, For noble funeral rites the unblest offerings bless? SEMICHORUS. Who o'er the godlike man shall raise The lofty funeral chant of praise? Mingled with bitter tears of ruth, Utter from the full heart the noble truth? CLYTEMNESTRA. Now on this man the oracle Hath all fulfilled its deathly spell. But I with solemn oath do now For ever covenant and vow With the great DÃ¦mon of the place, DÃ¦mon of the Pleisthenid race, To be content with scanty share (Unbearable though 'tis to bear). But that great DÃ¦mon, on his side, From this our house departing wide, Some other fated race shall haste With murther foul and bloody deeds to waste. Of all the treasures of our hoarded gold, Some slender pittance I am content to hold, Driving far off the murtherous rage That hath possessed this house from age to age. ÃGISTHUS. O light propitious of this day, that brings High justice in her train. Now may we say The Gods, the avengers of man's guilt, look down From the far heavens upon the sins of earth; Beholding how that man lies there, enwrapt In the Furies' fine-woven robes (glad sight to us!), Paying the penalty of his father's craft. For Atreus, this land's king, and that man's father, My father, his own brother (I speak plainly), Thyestes, in a strife for supreme power, Drove into exile from his house and home. Thyestes, the long-suffering, back returned, And sat a suppliant by his native hearth. And safe he dwelt and happy; safety it seemed And happiness, that, dying, with his blood He did not redden his own native soil. But impious Atreus, father of this man, With eager-seeming love, that was not love, An hospitable feast of sacrifice Made for my father, feast of reconcilement. But for the holy victim of that feast He served up to him his own children's flesh. The extremities, the fingers, and the feet, Unseen of those that sat at the high board, Lay covered up in a close dish apart. No sign betrayed; my father took and ate, Ignorant, that meal fatal to all his race. But when he knew the abominable deed, He shrieked, and vomiting up the unnatural food, Fell to the ground. Then on all Pelops' sons (The festal board by his spurning heel o'erthrown) Uttered the deep intolerable curse, âSo perish all the race of Pleisthenes!â In this obscure, perhaps mutilated passage, I have introduced, as did Mr. Symmons, what seemed wanting to make the sense clear. And in this man ye see that curse fulfilled, Low weltering as he lies in his death-trance; And me the artisan of that just deed. For us, too, with our miserable father, Thirteen poor innocent and helpless children, Me yet an infant in my swaddling clothes, Did he drive forth to endless banishment. But me, grown up, great justice did bring back, And long, close at his gates, I watched this man, Weaving in silence all my dark designs. Now, 'twere a glorious thing for me to die, Seeing him caught in justice' iron toils. CHORUS. Ãgisthus!âI do hold it impious To insult the dead. With hand premeditate Thou say'st thou hast done this piteous deedâthou only. I say thy guilty head will not escape The curses of the indignant populace, Their curses, and their killing showers of stones. ÃGISTHUS. Thou speak'st that labourest at the lowest oar; They hold the sway who sit on the high deck. Old as ye are, and hard as 'tis to teach Meek lesson to such greybeards, ye must learn To speak the words of truth and soberness. Chains and the dungeon, fastings on prison fare, Are excellent physicians for proud minds. Ye that can see so much, see ye not this? Kick not against the pricks! ye strive in vain. CHORUS. Woman! for him, thy husband, chief of men, Returning glorious from the battle-field, (Shamefully first defiled his genial bed:) Hast thou devised this miserable fate? ÃGISTHUS. Ye'll rue these words; beginnings they will be Of bitter sorrows! There's no music in them. Not like the voice of Orpheus is your voice. His sweet tones all things followed in their joy; Ye with your howlings would wake up and goad To madness even the gentlest. But we'll tame you, And ye shall crouch submissive at our feet. CHORUS. And thou in Argos, shalt thou tyrant be, Who having cunningly devised this deed, With thine own coward arm darest not achieve it? ÃGISTHUS. It was the woman's part to deal in guile: Had I appeared, suspected as his foeâ His ancient well-known foeâall had been lost. Now all is won: and, master of his wealth, I will essay to rule the subject city. I the unruliest and most pampered steed Will bridle, and make bear the heaviest yoke; Or hunger, that with dungeon-darkness dwells, Pale prison-mate, shall see him meek and mild. CHORUS. Dastard and base! The man with thine own hand Thou darest not slay. A womanâfoul disgrace She of her country and her country's gods! Murdered him. O Orestes, seest thou yet The blessed light of day? When wilt thou come, By favouring fortune hither timely led, To be the slayer of this bloody two. ÃGISTHUS. Speak ye thus? and do ye thus?âspeedily shall ye repent. CHORUS. Up, my fellow-soldiers, up!âUp, the strife is not far off! ÃGISTHUS. CHORUS. Up! and every one be ready,âwith his drawn sword in his hand. ÃGISTHUS. With my drawn sword in my right hand,âI will not refuse to die. CHORUS. We accept the challenge! Die, then!âBe the day's good fortune ours! CLYTEMNESTRA. Stay thee, stay, of men the dearest!âlet us work no further ill. We should reap a doleful harvestâmowing down these wretched men. There hath been enough of miseryânot another drop of blood. Go, ye old men, go! retire yeâto your fate-appointed homes, Ere ye do some deed of mischief,âand so suffer as ye do. What is done is done for ever;âwe must bear it as we may. Let who will go labour furtherâ'tis enough, enough for us, Smitten by the awful DÃ¦mon,âin his overwhelming wrath. Hear, and hearken to my counsel, though 'tis but a woman speaks. ÃGISTHUS. But shall thus 'gainst me these greybeardsâpluck their idle flowers of speech, Thus pour out their insolent language,âtempting wantonly their fate, Wandering thus from sober reason,âbearding thus their lord and king? CHORUS. 'Tis not for the sons of Argosâon a wicked man to fawn. ÃGISTHUS. But hereafter my dread presenceâye shall feel and ye shall fear. CHORUS. Not if the great Gods Orestesâhasten hitherward to send. ÃGISTHUS. Well I know the hopes of exilesâvainly for their homes athirst. CHORUS. Do it, do it; get fat and wanton;âJustice' holy robe defile. ÃGISTHUS. 'Tis your hour. Ye of your follyâsoon shall pay us the full meed. CHORUS. Strut thou in thy boastful carriage,âlike a cock beside his mate. CLYTEMNESTRA. Care not for those idle howlings;âyou and I will take the rule, And will wisely order all thingsâin this ancient kingly house.</field>
