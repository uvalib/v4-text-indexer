      <field name="fulltext">THE NEPHEW OF CHARLEMAGNE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. The Lady Bertha. The Chevalier Walter. Roland, their Son. The Emperor Charlemagne. The Fool. Lords, Knights, Ladies, &amp;c., &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Scene. The Porch of a Church. A Stormy Night. Bertha. And so they drive us from their door, One and another. Rest we here. Roland. Yea, let us rest. But, mother dear, How comes it that we are so poor, And have to beg for food and drink, And go about in poor attire? For, when I look at you, I think You should have all your heart's desire, Like any queen, in wine and meat; Instead of rags, with naked feet, You should in silks and satins go: Why are we poor? Bertha. I do not know, Save that the Lord hath willed it so; Often I think that you should be The best-housed boy in Christendie; And go in choice apparel; and fly Your hawks against the morning sky; Andâ Roland. Oh, that would indeed be grand! Bertha. And have a pony to commandâ Roland. Oh, mother dear! When will it be That I these joyful things shall see, And have a pony of my own, And fly my hawks? (jumping) Bertha. Ah, mind the stone, Or you may hurt your feet unshod! Roland. Stay, mother, I will pray to God, This night, to make a queen of you, And give you clothes of gold and blue, And venison fair when you must dine, And shining goblets filled with wine; A crown of diamonds for your head; A necklace of the coral redâ Bertha. Come, Roland, that, I think, will do, For a poor shoeless boy like you, And a poor half-clad ladyâ Roland. Oh, You are a lady? Now, I know I always thought you were! Bertha. And I, What shall I wish for, for my boy, My noble Roland, my dear son? The hawks, the ponyâBut, have done How faint I feel! Cold falls the rain; Not for the state of Charlemagne Would I this night have turned away A beggar from my door. Roland. But pray, Who, mother, is this Emperor, This Charlemagne? What is he for? Shall I go to him? Bertha. Help us, saints! Roland. Oh, some one help! My mother faints!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Scene, the same. Choristers heard singing in an adjoining cloisterâ Nocte surgentes Vigilemus omnesâ Walter (entering). Ay, sing to keep yourselves awake! You need not do it for my sake; Unhappy people easily Keep open lids. Now let me see How long it is since Charlemagne Banished my wife and me. I wis He thinks me dead. Why, what is this? [Stumbling on Bertha's body. Roland. Oh, sir, take pity on our pain; My mother lies here, faint for food! Do you know Charlemagne? Is he good? Walter. Surely, I know that neck,âthat head! Speak to me, Bertha? Roland. Is she dead? You must not touch her! Do you dare, To chafe her hands, to part her hair? Not dead? Then, sir, she will arise And strike you down with her noble eyes. Walter. Rouse, Bertha, rouse! She does not stir. Roland. You shall not kiss my mother, sir; How rude! How dare you breathe on her? Walter. Child, child, it is to do her good. But, ah, your mother must have food! Roland. Shall I go beg some meal and wine Of Charlemagne? Walter. Why, that were fine! No; (bitterly) go and take them, child, and say, âYour sister faints.â But this is playâ She pants, her eyelids tremble moreâ [While Walter is occupied with the lady, Roland rushes wildly off. Roland. Ho, Charlemagne! Sir Emperor!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Scene. The Banqueting Hall of the Emperor. Lords and ladies. Musicians, torches, pages, &amp;c. Roland rushes in, and seizes and bears off, with a defiant look, a dish of peacock. Charlemagne and the guests start, and laugh, but let him pass. They applaud; and so do the beggars clustered around the gate. Charlemagne. In sooth, a fine, well-favoured boy! Fool. Why, yes, my liege, but somewhat coy. [Laughter, minstrelsy. [Roland again enters, and now carries off a goblet of wine. Charl. That is a thief to our own taste! Fool. And mine. The banquet shall be graced With two of the same patternâtwo! [Snatches a goblet and pockets it, having drunk up the wine. Charl. Nay, Fool, that trick will scarcely do; Distinguoâ [Minstrelsy and laughter. Here he comes again! [Roland again enters, and seizes a lady's robe, with a diadem. Charlemagne takes him by the wrist, laughing. Charl. Boy, do you know me,âCharlemagne? I think you are the merriest guest That ever graced an emperor's board. Roland. Not merry I, indeed, my lord! [Struggling to get off. Charl. What is the meaning of this jest? Roland. There is no jest. This lovely robe Is for my mother's neck. This globe Of studded velvet for her brow. Charl. Mother! What manner of mother, now? You take the choicest dish you see, As 'twere an apple from a tree; You take the rich wine ruby-red, Like water from a river's bed; You take a robe of cost, as though It were a cloth of frieze; and, lo! You snatch a glittering diadem As 'twere an old-wife's cap! Roland. No, no! Mean things for serfs, and serfs for them! Fruit from the orchards peasants bring; They drink the water of the spring; Yea, and go dressed in cloth of frieze; But my mother must have the choicest meat, And the richest wine, and a garment fair, And she must have for her long bright hair, A crown with jewels gay like these! Charl. If thus your mother is a lady great, You must show me where she sits in state; And count up all her retinue, And tell me who is her steward; who, Her chamberlain? Roland. My good right hand Her steward is, as here I stand; My left her chamberlain. Charl. Ho, ho! How they can serve her, well I know. Who are her faithful guards, Sir Knight? Roland. My eyes, that watch her ever aright. Charl. Who are her minstrel and jester gay? Roland. My lips, that can both sing and say. Charl. Why, what a knight, my lords, is this! How tall art thou? Four feet, I wis. A goodly stature. Go thy ways, And fetch thy mother, boy; for she, We swear, shall join our revelry. Roland. Sir, first I must know what she says! Perchance she will not come! Charl. (starting with affected wonder). We mark You well. We pray her, of her grace, To stoop to this our humble board. Ho, one of you, take torch and swordâ Sir Lionelâthe night is dark; Accompany this valiant spark, And see to it, that he brings the dame. Come, drink! for merrily speeds the game; Upon my word, a fine conceit! And we will give reception meet Unto the lady, whosoe'er She be, that owns a boy so fair. All. Ay, ay, my lord! Charl. You players there, Play of your very best, when we The signal give for minstrelsy! More torches! Lords and ladies bright, See ye keep well our state to-night!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. Scene, the same. Enter the Chevalier Walter disguised in the grey robe of a pilgrim; the Lady Bertha, as a beggar, with her face hidden in a fold of her dress; Roland; Sir Lionel, with the torch. Charl. Hah! here the youngster comes again. Roland (advancing). I bring you here, Sir Charlemagne, My mother; the lady who, I said, Should have choice wine, and fine white bread, And choice meat, and a diadem, And go attired in cloth of grainâ Fool (aside). Of other people's, you knowâahem! Charl. Draw near, my lords and ladies bright, And see this Lady, with her Knight, And her attendant, who appears A pilgrim somewhat bent with years. [Bertha and Walter kneel; Roland stands with folded arms. Rise, madam, rise! But who is he In pilgrim-grey that bends the knee, Beside this fair boy? Bertha. Oh, my lord, Not as a beggar at your board Come I. And yet there is a thing That I have come to ask the kingâ Fool. Say, emperor. Do you not know Our lord the Pope hath crowned him so? Walter. Pardon! An emperor is a king; And after years of wandering, Perchance this Lady bright, like me, May have forgot some heraldry. I am a pilgrim, sire, and you Gave me my pilgrimage to do, But did not fix the time and place, When I should once more see your face. Fool. In faith, this jesting is so fine, That one might almost think it mine. Charl. Peace, Fool! I think this is no sport. What (aside) may this stranger's words import? Fool. My lords and ladies of the court, This is not sport, but tragedy, And we will weep for't by-and-by! A Retainer (rudely clutching at Bertha whom he uncovers). Beseech you, madam, for a chance Of seeing your sweet countenance! Walter (seizing him). Wine-flustered vassal! for your life, Lay a rude finger on my wife! Charl. My sister, and the chevalier! Fool. I said the laugh would prove a tear: I knew that there was something else; A sort of muffling of the bells Came over me from head to heel; Your Fool is mighty quick to feel (sighing); No pimpernel upon the lea Foreknows the rain as well as he When ladies' eyes must redden. Charl. I see This was well planned. It is a trap. Bertha. No, sir; it is the simplest hap That ever to mortal man befell. Rolandâ Roland. Yes, uncle, I can tell How it all came about. But firstâ Fool. Yes, do tell me, or I shall burstâ Roland. Mother must have a cushioned seat, Yea, and a footstool for her feet. Walter. My noble son! Fool (rubbing his eyes). Oh, oh, boohoo! When fools weep, what should wise men do? Charl. (half aside). Well, I think I begin to foresee what must be my part in this comedy. I banished my sister and confiscated her husband's possessions, because her marriage did not please me; and now I have, without meaning it, made a public show of my own flesh and blood. Silence, Fool, with that blubbering of yours! [He turns away, with his arms folded, and converses with a priest. Fool. I was only trying how it felt to have a good cry, being tired of laughing all day; but I suppose being miserable is a luxury of the great,âlike these surprises. Nothing wonderful ever happens to the poor Foolâthe sun goes on rising and setting, just as if he was nobody. StopâI have wonderful dreams sometimes, when I lie down with the dogs under the perches of the falcons, for I dream I am the Emperor having a brush with the Saxonsâstiff customers; but would you believe it, they never rise up again after I have put them down. I believe I should have made a better emperor after all thanâ Roland. Father, why does not my uncle kiss his sister, and give her a seat on the dais? [Charlemagne embraces Bertha, and gives his hand to Walter. Fool. Yes, uncle, why don't you kiss your sister? I like to be beforehand in suggesting things. There is somewhat of the prophet in me. My mantle is a mistake. Bertha. Where, then, is Roland? How busy he seems out there, talking with that scatter-brains in cap and bells! [The Fool leads Roland to the front. Fool. Young sir, I know a boy exactly like youâ that is to say, supposing a nephew of the Emperor can be a boy. Roland. Oh, I am a boy. Is the boy you speak of exactly like me? Fool. He has two good eyes! Roland. Well! Fool. And two good hands! Roland. Well! Fool. And a pair of legs, with feet! Roland. You mock me, Fool. Fool. Not I. And his feet are shoeless, and he goes in rags. Roland. Like me! Fool. And he drinks plain water, and eats rye-bread, and is glad to get a frieze coat to his back. Roland. Where does he live, then? Fool. I do believe he is a brave, good boy, too. Roland. Then I will fly my hawks with him, and he shall ride my pony, and I will give him some of my venison, and ask my father if he may have some wine. Charl. Where is our nephew? Come hither, Roland! Roland. I come, uncle! But, Fool, has your boy such a mother as mine? [Running up. Walter (gravely). I think you had better say nothing about Roland's mother, Fool. Fool. It is my wish and desire so to do, sir. Now, if I were a learned clerkâconfound that minstrelsy!âI would say something about Father Adam and Mother Eve. But being only a poor Fool, and not a word being audible in the din just now, I shall content myself with an act of imperial grace. Thereâwe pardon everybody, and do desire that the festivities may continue! THE END.</field>
