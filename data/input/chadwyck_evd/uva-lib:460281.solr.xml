      <field name="fulltext">The Shafts of Beauty irresistless are; But She that's Virtuous still outshines the Fair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE Young LADIES OF Mrs. Bellamy's School: PARTICULARLY Those concern'd in the following Performance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken (the First Time of its Performance) in Private. Gentlemen, and Ladies, Perhaps You'll say, too rashly We proceed, And aim to Act, before We well can Read; That without Thought, or Conduct We advance, And fain wou'd Move with Art, before We've learnt to Dance. Some Few there are may so Censorious be; Yet still We hope, that the Majority Will smile at our Attempt, and Infancy. To You, Kind Ladies, We our Homage pay, And beg You'll favour This Our First Essay, This little Sketch, This Shadow of a Play. We Undertook It only as a Tryal, Aud Not to please wou'd be a sore Denial. Then, Ladies, take what follows in good Part, And pardon Want of Scenes, Fine Cloaths, and Art; Tho' ne're so ill perform'dâTis doing Something, And more Commendable at least thanâRomping.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken (the First Time of its Performance) in Private. Ladies, To You, Fair Judges, I'm with Orders come, To know at Once what is our Final Doom: Trembling within, our Little Actors wait, And seem Impatient till They know their Fate. Some, too Morose, shew by their Angry Looks, They wish We had Rehears'd Our Spelling Books; And think Our Time had been much better spent At Cross-Stitch, Irish-Stitch, or at the Tent: Yet still, We hope, We have a Party here, Who'll be as Merciful, as They Severe. If This We find diverts You, We propose Next Breaking-up, to borrow Scenes and Cloaths. Our JOVE in Awful Thunder shall appear, And Hermes, doubly wing'd, shall cut the Air; Our Shepherd on a Mossy Bank shall lye, Watching, his fleecy Flocks, that graze hard by. Our Goddesses in gaudy Vests shall shine, And seem, tho' Mortal, to be all Divine. Cupid shall wait on Venus with his Bow, And with his Arrows pierce Young Paris thro': At last, To finish This Our harmless Sport, We'll All be drest t'adorn Fair Venus' Court. Proud of Applause, at all this Pomp We'll-aim, And spare no Pains, or Cost, to purchase Fame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken (the Last Time of its Performance) in Publick. [A Messenger delivers a Letter, as from the Actors to the Prolocutor. After a short Perusal, She tears it with Resentment, and begins.] I wo'n't speak This Prologue, Go, tell 'em so; If They no Wit, I can some Manners show. I put on Airs, and huff the Audience! Tell 'em 'tis rude, and argues Want of Sense.â No, Ladies, I'll an humbler Method take, And will presume no Prologue here to speak: You thought I wou'dâbut People may mistake. Were You to wreck the fruitfullest Invention, You can't imagine what is my Intention; But, not to be too tedious, I'll explain The mighty Project of my Teeming Brain. 'Tis Thisâwith all due Reverence and Submission, To sum up all Our Wants in a Petition. Were Ye to know how great is Our Distress, What Pains We take at Times like These for Dress, We cou'dn't ask Your Aid without Success. No Country Heiress, that to Town resorted, Full of Herself, and longing to be courted, Takes half that Care to drive the City thro', And ransack every Shop for Something Gay, and New. First then, We move You Gentlemen and Beaus, To furnish us with all Your Gayest Cloaths; Fring'd Gloves, Tye-Wigs, Edg'd-Hats with Smart Cockades, And Morning-Gowns made all of Rich Brocades; Embroider'd-Coats, and Wastcoats, if You'll spare 'em: We ask no Breechesâ'Te'nt Our Place to wear 'em. Now, to You, Ladies, humbly We apply For a Fresh Grant of all Your Finery; Your Brilliants, Lockets, Watches, Tweezer-Cases, Flow'rs for Our Heads, and Patches for our Faces: Hoops, Fringes, Store of Pins and Bodkins; Besides a Thousand other little Odd Things, Too tedious here in Order to express, And not so proper for a Short Address. We're All Ambitious of Appearing Fine, And fain wou'd with Uncommon Lustre shine; Then send these Trinkets in without Delay, And Your Petitioners shall ever pray.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken (the Last Time of its Performance) in Publick. Gentlemen and Ladies, Our Master fears We've tyr'd You All to Night, With his Dull Farce shewn in so feint a Light; But as He seeks not for a Poet's Fame, And Our Improvement is His Only Aim; As He proposes Nothing on His Part, But Teaching us to Move, and Speak with Art; He hopes Your Goodness will a Smile bestow, And None go Home with a Contracted Brow; Hopes You'll excuse Whate're You've seen amiss, Approve a Task so Innocent as This, And with Applause Our Nymphs and Swains dismiss. âHis Hopes are crown'd.âI see Good Nature rise, And Pleasure sparkling in Your Generous Eyes. Methinks, I hear Some praise Our Artless Song, And own 'tis Pretty, as We're All so Young. Ladies; We're overjoy'd You look so Easy, And very Proud, that This Night's Labours please Ye. In Length of Time, We hope, We shall Improve, And by Degrees, Encrease Your Mirth and Love. This First Essay Let Your Indulgence spare, We'll Speak more Artfully Another Year: 'Twasn't a Day did Rome's Bright Fabrick rear. In short,âBe to Our Little Merit wond'rous Kind, But to Our Faults, Be (like our Cupid)âBlind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Jupiter. Mercury. Cupid. Paris. Juno. Pallas. Venus. Oenone. Florinda. Shepherds, Shepherdesses, the Graces, Hours, and Other Attendants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE Mount IDA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. A Prospect of Mount IDA. Jupiter and Mercury appear in the Air. Jup. Hast, Hermes, hast, for Earth thy Flight prepare; To Paris this Important Message bear. Tell him that Pallas, and the Queen of Love At Variance are with the Great Wife of JOVE: Tell him All Three will on Yon Mount descend, And by His Judgment their Contention end. Give him this Golden Ball:âBe This the Prize Of Her, who gains the Conquest o're his Eyes. Mer. With winged Speed I'll cut the Liquid Air, Well pleas'd, Great JOVE, Your dread Commands to bear. Jupiter ascends. Mercury flies downwards, and disappears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. A Myrtle Grove. Enter Oenone, and Florinda. Oeno. Hail, Sacred Grove, thou silent, calm Retreat! Free from the Troubles that attend the Great! Wou'd Heav'n but smile, and prove so much my Friend, To make my Fortune on my Wish depend; The Pomp of Courts shou'd never tempt my Eyes, And I'd th'Elysian Shades for Thine despise. How truly is the Nymph, Florinda, blest, Whom Nature, and not Art hath neatly drest! Who manages with Care her little Store, Lives above Want, and wishes for no more! No anxious Cares, which Others feel, molest The peaceful Calm that dwells within her Breast. Whilst on the Grass her Lambkins bleating lye, Her Loving Swain feasts on her Lovely Eye: Under some favourite Myrtle's pleasant Shade, By kind Appointment meets the Tender Maid: There with repeated Vows his Passion tells, There She as freely her Pure Flame reveals. These are the Pleasures of the peaceful Grove, And I am blest with such a Faithful Love. Flor. Yonder, Oenone, comes thy Lovely Swain, And seems to seek Thee with a pleasing Pain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. Enter Paris to Oenone and Florinda. Par. Where hast Thou been, Thou Queen of my Desires, Thou dearest Partner of my softest Fires? With Longing Eyes I've sought Thee thro' the Grove; A Moment's Absence seems an Age in Love. Oeno. My faithful Paris is my Soul's Delight, My Wish by Day, and all my Dream by Night. The softest Language never can impart The secret Transports of my Yielding Heart; While I Thy Beauteous Form, Kind Swain, survey, And gaze with Joy my very Soul away. Paris. My Dear Oenone's brighter than a Star; Stars I have seen, but ne'r saw one so Fair. Cou'd Heav'n some greater Master-piece devise, Adorn'd with all the Glories of the Skies; Yet still in vain That Nymph shou'd rival Thee, Unless he made another Heart for me. Oeno. With how much Ease, I, whom I love, believe; And Want of Worth for One so Good I grieve. I'll never more remove me from thy Sight: Thou shalt my Guardian be, I thy Delight. Paris. For Love of Thee, ev'n Queens I cou'd despise, And own the Triumph of Oenone's Eyes. Oeno. Not Beds of State cou'd half so grateful be, As Mossy Banks, and New fall'n Leaves with Thee. Paris. Oh! Thou art dearer to my Soul than Rest To Mariners, with Winds and Storms opprest: More dear than to the sordid Miser Gold, Or Pomp, and Pow'r to him that's Brave, and Bold. Oeno. Oh! I cou'd ever hear thy Charming Tongue, (Thy Voice is sweeter than the Syrens Song) And never think the Blessed Hours too long! No Nymph was ever sure so truly blest, Nor of so Fond a Partner e're possest. Paris. No Swain was e're so Happy sure, to find A Nymph so Beauteous, and so wond'rous Kind. Oh! may out present Happiness endure From Fortune, Time, and Envious Death secure! Oeno. Oh! may this Harmony for ever last, And every Hour prove happier than the past! Paris. The Nymphs and Swains shall celebrate our Bliss, And make a Publick Festival for this; Shall all unite to entertain my Fair, And Thy Diversion shall be all their Care. Florinda, Call thy Jovial Partners in, And let their harmless Sports forthwith begin. (Florinda goes out. Paris and Oenone seat themselves in Two Chairs, adorn'd with Flowers.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IV. The PASTORAL Interlude. ENTITUL'D, The Unhappy Stock-Jobbers: OR, The SOUTH-SEA Penitents. Enter Florinda with Sylvia, Damon, Menalcas, and Amaryllis. Florinda retires, and sits down by Oenone. Sylvia comes forward, and speaks. The PROLOGUE. Gentlemen, and Ladies, Perhaps You'll Our Master's in the Wrong, To let Us Speak who are so Very Young: To let Us here a Pastoral rehearse, Before We've any Knowledge of a Verse. Thus Some may sayâbut Those of more Discerning Know 'tis the Way to Cheat Us into Learning. Then, Ladies, still We hope You'll be so Good, As not to nip Us in the Tender Bud; But smile at Our Attempt, espouse Our Cause, And crown Our Little Labours with Applause. The PASTORAL Interlude. N. B. For the Ease of the Little Ladies Memories, the Lines only thus marked (') where spoken in the Performance. Syl. âWhy have my dearest Friends this Grotto chose âWhere the Pale Yew, and pensive Poplar grows? Why do Ye thus sit sighing, and alone, And to the Woods, and Mountains make your Moan? âCan any Sorrow your sad Hearts possess, âWhich Sylvia will not pity, or redress? (Turns to Damon.) O! Vent the Galling Secrets of Your Heart, And to Your Faithful Friends, Your Pains impart! Whose Sympathizing Sighs may ease Your Soul, And Tears in Consort all Your Tears condole. Damon. âOh! that We ne're had liv'd to see the Day, âWhen first we sold our Flocks, and flung our Crooks away! âBefore, how happy in Our Rural Bow'rs, âIn Mirth and Play We spent Our harmless Hours! âHow oft have We, within Our Calm Retreat, â(Whilst on each Side We heard Our Lambkins bleat) âSmil'd at the Troubles that attend the Great! âBut yet (We know not how) Ambition fir'd âOur Souls, and Hopes of Gain Our Thoughts inspir'd. âFor These We from Those Sacred Plains withdrew, âBid all Our Cheerful Fellow Swains adieu, âAnd to the Busy World in Haste We flew. Menal. âSoon as We sold our Flocks We bought a Ship, âWhich plow'd, in hopes of Gain, the dang'rous Deep, âAnd to Our Wishes shun'd the Tempests Roar, âThe Rugged Rocks, and Pyrates lawless Pow'r. âPropitious Heav'n, regardful of Our Pray'rs, âOur Goods from Loss secur'd, Our Minds from Fears, âAnd with Unenvy'd Wealth rewarded all Our Cares. âBut, Oh! Dear Sylvia, Sure Our Cruel Fate âRais'd high Our Joys to make Our Pains more Great! âShe brought indeed a Glorious Scene to View, âBut to Our Torment soon that Scene withdrew. So from his Window the poor Prisoner spies A pleasant Plain, and feasts his greedy Eyes: But when he turns, and hears his ratling Chain, The Prospect serves but to encrease his Pain. Syl. âWhy, dear Menalcas, would'st Thou tempt thy Fate, âAnd hazard Greatness to be yet more Great? When Fortune had so far propitious been, Why didst Thou not come back to Us again?â Thou should'st have rul'd Sole Monarch of our Plain. âBut Thou, by blind Ambition hurry'd on, âWast resolutely bent, like Phaeton, âTo drive the Chariot of the Day, or None. Damon. âHad We to Wealth Virtue's bright Precepts join'd, âAnd with strong Reason fenc'd Our feeble Minds, âWe needn't now Our Tragick Story tell, âNor mourn the Fatal Frauds by which We fell. Men. âNear to the Royal Bourse a Jonathan's Coffee-House. Dome there lies, âWhere Knaves grow insolent by Gain, and Fools by Loss grow wise. On every Side are soft Enchantments seen, But Scylla and Carybdis lurk within: Yet such bewitching Charms delude the Eye, That Few ('till 'tis too late) their Danger see. Thus the Unwary Traveller disdains The Common Road, and seeks the flow'ry Plains, Thinking the Pleasure will reward his Pains: But to his Cost he finds with much Surprize, That in the Verdant Grass the Poisonous Adder lies. A Fourfold Path Exchange Alley. directs the Motly Throng, Made up of every Nation, every Tongue: Thro' which with Eager Haste they thither run, Some to Undo, but more to be Undone. âTo this Vile Spot a subtil, wily Crew âOur heedless Steps by strong Enticements drew. Amar. âTell us, Menalcas, how their Snares they laid, âWhat Arts they us'd your Senses to invade, âAnd how your Soul was such a Captive made. Men. âThe Musick of their false, deluding Tongues âWas soft, and fatal as the Syrens Songs. âWith Heaps of Promis'd Gold they first essay'd, âAnd brib'd our weaker Passions to their Aid. These gain'd, with Ease our Reason they controul'd, And soon prevail'd our inmost Thoughts t'unfold. Then Secrets deep with Freedom they disclos'd, And with Assur'd Success each New Design propos'd. Amar. âCou'd you by specious Words alone be caught, âAnd taken in a Net so slightly wrought? âThe Bitter Pill is always gilded o're; âWith Ease, methinks, you might such Frauds explore. Dam. âWith strong Deceit their Artful Plots they form'd, âAnd Magick Scenes of Wealth their Dark Intrigues adorn'd; But when these fail, as fail they sometimes will, And you begin to dread th'Approaching Ill; A Thousand Guileful Tales they strait contrive, To make the Dying Hope in Expectation live. âThus charm'd from Virtue's peaceful Paths we stray'd, âAnd to recountless Ills our thoughtless Souls betray'd. Amar. âCease your Complaints, your Sighs and Tears give o're; âIf you'll resolve to lead that Life no more, âWe will your Stock of Sheep and Goats renew, âThat You may bid the Busy Faithless, World Adieu. The PASTORAL ended, they join in a Figure Dance to the South-Sea Tune. The Dance over, Amaryllis speaksâ The EPILOGUE. Gentlemen and Ladies, Our Little Pastoral Interlude is done, And now the Scenes at first propos'd come on: To This alone I ask You to be kind, Let Those more Favours beg who come behind. All pay their Respects to Paris and Oenona, and go out. Florinda rises, and sings the following SONG On the Pleasures of a Country Life. I How Happy are the Nymphs and Swains, Who dwell on the Idalean Plains! No Gares break in upon their Ease, But All is Harmony and Peace. Cho. No Cares break in, &amp;c. II The Nymphs without a Frown appear, And look as Pleasant as they're Fair. Each does her Faithful Partner prize, And meets him with Consenting Eyes. Cho. Each does her Faithful, &amp;c. III No Distant Airs they know, nor Arts, To torture their Poor Lovers Hearts; But freely they disclose their Mind, And prove as Constant as they're Kind. Cho. But freely they disclose, &amp;c. IV Thus, like the First Blest Pair, they live, And Joys reciprocally give; Thus spend their Days without Offence In God-like Love and Innocence. Cho. Thus spend their Days, &amp;c. After the SONG, Paris and Oenone dance. The Rural Diversions over, Paris, Oenone, and Florinda sit down again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE V. Enter Mercury to Paris, Oenone and Florinda. Mer. From High Olympus, and the Realms above, Behold, I come from the Great Thund'rer JOVE. Shepherd, Arise All rise, and pay their Homage to Mercury., and leave thy Rural Care, To listen to the Message which I bear. Regard no more thy Crook, and Tuneful Reed, Forbear henceforth thy fleecy Flocks to feed; For Thou to Greater Honours art decreed. Paris. Say, Hermes, say, why dost thou seek this Plain, To greet so kindly such a Lowly Swain?â What does the Mighty Thunderer Ordain? Mer. This Radiant Fruit, which here I grasp, behold, Brighter by far than any Burnish'd Gold. For This Three Beauteous Goddesses contend; For This alone they now to Earth descend. By JOVE commission'd, take the Golden Prize, And give It Her who has the Fairest Eyes. (Delivers him the Golden Ball.) Paris. O rising Joy! O ravishing Delight! What Mortal can support the Glorious Sight! Alas! my Eyes too weak: No Human Brain Is able so much Rapture to sustain. I faint, I fall, O Hermes, take me hence, E're Extacy invades my Aching Sense. O! Help me, quickly help me, or I dye, And fall a Victim to Excess of Joy. Mer. Shepherd, be bold, with Freedom view each Face; Discover every Charm, and every Grace: Altho' Ten Thousand Darts should fly around, Thou shalt survey them all without a Wound. Happy art Thou above all Human Race; The GODS Themselves with Thee would change Their Place. Paris. Happy I am, altho' of Human Race: Nor with the GODS would I exchange my Place. Mer. Behold, Heav'ns Beauteous Goddesses appear, And sail with Splendor thro' the Ambient Air. (Mercury goes out, and Paris turns to Oenone.) Paris. My Dear Oenone, for a While be gone, I'll wait on Thee before the Setting Sun: Then on Thy Bosom I'll recline my Head, And tell Thee All that Heaven's Bright Queens have said. Oeno. 'Till the Sun sets, my Dearest Swain, farewel. (She retires to a Corner of the Stage.) (Aside.) I like not this: Yet why I cannot tell: My Boding Heart presages Something Ill. Something, I fear, will interrupt Our Love, Some New-born Hopes may teach His Heart to rove, And I should Dye should He Inconstant prove. (She goes out.) Paris. alone. My Pulse beats high, and all my Blood's on Fire: Methinks, I hear the Soft, Angelick Choir In most Harmonious, most Extatick Lays, Extol Their Vertues, and Their Beauties praise. [She retires to one Corner of the Stage. The Goddesses are seen at a Distance descending in a Golden Chariot drawn by Peacocks.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VI. Enter Juno, Pallas, and Venus to Paris. Juno. Saturnia, Wife of Thundring JOVE, am I, Belov'd by Him, and Empress of the Sky. First, Shepherd, fix on Me thy wond'ring Sight: Beware, and View Me well, and Judge aright. Pall. This Way, Oh! this Way bend thy wond'ring Eyes; 'Tis Pallas claims the Glorious Golden Prize: A Virgin-Goddess free from any Stain, And Queen of Arts, and Warlike Arms I reign. Venus. Hither, Oh! hither turn Thee, Gentle Swain, Shall VENUS sue, and shall She sue in Vain? 'Tis VENUS Only rules the GODS Above, 'Tis Love rules Them, and She Alone rules Love. Paris. I'm All ConfusionâHow shall I decide?â A Title sure so Equal ne're was try'd. Your Beauties thus United dim my Sight, And I at Random gaze, o'rewhelm'd with too much Light. Then let me view Apart each Heav'nly Fair, For Three at Once no Mortal Eye can bear. (Pallas and Venus retire to One Side of the Stage.) Juno. Let Great Ambition, Shepherd, fire thy Heart, And All Thy Aims keep Pace with thy Desert. Forsake thy Crook, and leave the Humble Plain, For Thou wert Born o're All Mankind to reign. Scepters and Crowns beneath Thy Feet I'll throw, And Peace and Plenty shall around Thee flow. This, This shall be Thy, Fate, if Mine's the Prize, And with Success I mount the Azure Skies: If in My Lap the Golden Ball be hurl'd, That Moment Thou art Monarch of the World. (She retires, and Pallas comes forwards.) Pall. Wake, Mortal wake; thy Drooping Spirits raise, And waste no more in Sloth thy Youthful Days. Resign thy Crook, and leave the Flow'ry Plain; O! Sooth the Nymphs no more, my Gentle Swain, Nor ever touch thy Tuneful Pipe again. Thy Rural Sports, thy Wanton Dances cease, And quit at Once, this Soft, Inglorious Ease. Hark! Shepherd, hark! the Glorious Voice of War Now calls Thee forth, and cries, For Arms prepare: Hark! How the Martial Musick charms the Air! The Ratling Drums their Chearful Marches beat, And Concave Rocks the Generous Sounds repeat. Let a Fresh Ardor in thy Bosom rise, And Restless Glory sparkle in Thy Eyes. I'll give Thee Courage to confront the Brave, And What Thy Fancy dictates Thou shalt have. Thy Foes shall at thy Feet All prostrate lye, And at Thy Awful Nod shall live, or dye. O! Think what Transports Every Conquest yields The Victor, marching from the Bloody Fields! O! Think how Great, how Glorious 'tis, to see The Godlike Hero flush'd with Victory! To see His Head with Wreaths of Laurel crown'd, And hear Fame's Golden Trump his Praises sound! To Me, Kind Swain, the Glorious Prize resign, And Fame, and Certain Conquest shall be Thine. [Pallas retires, and Venus comes forwards.] Venus. Stop, Lovely Youth, thy Choice a While delay, And hear what Cytharea has to say. Let not Ambition rob Thee of thy Ease; Nor for False Glory quit the Charms of Peace. Drive from thy Soul all Fear, and Anxious Care; The Pomp of Empire's but a gilded Snare. O! Think how fickle is the Warrior's Fate, And what Distracting Cares attend the Great! One Only Joy Mankind can truly know, And Love Alone that Blessing can bestow. Kind Nature fram'd Thee sure Alone for Love, And All that see Thee must Thy Form approve. Thy Form is so adorn'd with every Grace, That Venus looks with Pleasure on Thy Face. Happy's the Nymph that's circl'd in Thy Arms, Altho' the Mistress of Ten Thousand Charms. Should Beauteous Helen once Thy Shape survey, With Pleasure She would gaze Her Heart away. Soon would the Queen All other Joys despise, And own the Triumph of Thy Conqu'ring Eyes. To Me, Kind Swain, the Golden Ball resign, And that Fair, Matchless Beauty shall be Thine. Paris. I yield, I yield, O Venus! take the Prize: All Cupid's Darts are in Thy Lovely Eyes. O, Beauteous Queen! O, Goddess of Desire! Forbear to fan my Raging Passions higher, With Greater Joys my Ravish'd Soul to move, And be Propitious to my Ardent Love. [Venus draws nearer to Paris, and Juno comes forwards.] Juno. Audacious Mortal, thus to slight My Love! My Boundless Offers thus to disapprove! Strait I'll ascend the Skies, to JOVE appeal; To JOVE thy Partial Judgment I'll reveal. Justly Thou'st drawn His Vengeance on thy Head, And with His Thunder He shall strike thee dead. (She goes out, and Pallas comes forward.) Pallas. Ungrateful Shepherd, thus to give the Prize! And thus the Queen of Arts and Arms despise! Thou shalt not long adore thy Helen's Charms; I'll fright Thee with the Glorious Din of Arms. The Spartan Chiefs shall soon thy Peace destroy, Spight of thy Favourite Venus, and her Boy. Soon to thy Cost, thou, Partial Youth, shalt knowâ What 'tis Wars Goddess, thus provok'd, can do. (She goes out.) Paris. My Judgment's past, and all Your Threats are vain: Revenge Your CauseâTo Mighty JOVE complainâ To Beauteous Venus I'll for Refuge fly, And if She can't protect me, then I'll dye. (He goes out with Venus Hand in Hand.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VII. Enter Oenone and Florinda. Oeno. Sure some Ill Planet rul'd when I was born! Oenone's lost, forsaken, and forlorn. Oh! my Prophetick Fears were all too just, And my Fond Heart did soon this Change mistrust. Oh! may That Day be blotted from the Year, When Paris first did on these Plains appear! Oh! that I'd mingled with the Common Throng, And never listen'd to his Perjur'd Tongue! How Happy once I was!âbut sure my Fate Rais'd high my Joys to make my Pains more Great: She brought indeed a Glorious Scene to View; But soon alas! that Pleasing Scene withdrew. So when a Prisoner from his Window spies A Flow'ry Plain, he feasts his greedy Eyes; But when he turns, and hears his Ratling Chains, The Prospect serves but to encrease his Pains. Lead me, Florinda, to some dismal Gloom, Where the Sun's Chearful Rays can never come. There let me spend my last Remains of Life In Floods of Sorrow, and Incessant Grief. Flor. My Dear Oenone, hear Florinda speak, Upon Thy Friend some Kind Compassion take, And don't Two Hearts at Once unkindly break. Cease, cease Thy Tears; Upon My Arm recline. I'll bear My Part; let Half Thy Griefs be Mine. Forget His Treatment, and no more complain, But meet His Suddain Coldness with Disdain. Let not Despair thus wreck Thy Tender Breast; I'll sing, and tune Thy Tortur'd Soul to Rest. Oenone. If Ought in Nature sure cou'd ease My Pain, Make Me in Love with Life, and be Myself again; I own, Florinda, it cou'd only be Th'Enjoyment of so True, so Dear a Friend as Thee. Musick has Charms I've heard to soften Rocks, To temper Brutes, and bend the Knotted Oaks. Why then, shou'd I Alone excepted be? Why should Thy Musick have no Pow'r o're Me? Perhaps, Thy Soothing Sounds My Heart may cure, And I may feel these Anxious Pains no more. (She sits down in an Easy Chair.) FLORINDA sings. SONG. The Worst of Ills may Paris know, For Wronging Poor Oenone so: To win Her Heart, and then to prove So Base and False, as not to Love. O Cupid! Strike the Perjur'd Swain, And make Him feel the Raging Pain Of Ardent Love, and Cold Disdain. Oenone rises. Oeno. Thanks to My Friend, Methinks I feel New Life, And Scorn arises in the Room of Grief. I'll go This Moment, and upbraid the Swain, And ne're will trust Deceitful Man again. (She goes out.) Flor. O! that Her Heart with Love no more may burn! But much I fear, Her Fondness will return. (Goes out after Her.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VIII. Enter Paris, Venus, Cupid, the Graces, Hours, and Other Attendants. Cup. Attend, Ye Graces, and Ye Gentle Loves, Ye Billing Sparrows, and Ye Cooing Doves, To This Blest Place, Ye Flying Hours resort, Come All the Numerous Train of Venus' Court, In Concert join to sing My Mother's Name, With Chearful Voice Her Great Success proclaim O're Gilded Empires, and the Pride of Fame. O! Sing, and spread the Joyful News around, The Queen of Love is Queen of Beauty crown'd. (After Venus is seated in Her Triumphal Chair by Paris, and All the Attendants are rang'd in Order round about Her, One of the Graces sings the Following Song) SONG. Address'd to Paris and Venus on the Determination of the GOLDEN PRIZE. I Let LOVE's Goddess sooth Thy Mind, Guard no more Thy Fleecy Flock: Thour't for Greater Joys design'd, Leave the Plain, and quit thy Crook. Cho. Thou'rt for Greater, &amp;c. II Softest Sounds shall strike Thine Ear, Thou shalt revel in Delight: War's Alarms Thou ne're shalt hear, Nothing shall Thy Soul affright. Cho. War's Alarms, &amp;c. III Dread not Juno's Angry Frown, Pallas' Arms and Arts disdain; GODS Themselves LOVE's Pow'r own, Thou o're LOVE Himself dost reign. Cho. GODS Themselves, &amp;c. IV Goddess of Desire, Hail! Wond'rous Magick's in Thy Eyes: Charms like Thine must needs prevail, Justly Thou hast won the Prize. Cho. Charms like Thine, &amp;c. V JOVE Himself would partial prove, Should His Wrath the Swain pursue: Had Thy Cause been try'd Above, He had giv'n The BALL to You. Cho. Had Thy Cause, &amp;c. Cup. Now to conclude Our Joys let's all advance, And grace Her Triumph with a Chearful Dance. (A Figure Dance, and several other Dances. The Triumph ended, All the Attendants pay their Obedience to Venus and Paris, and go off in Order Two and Two.) Venus. Now Farewel, Paris, I'll ascend the Skies, And shew all round the Heav'ns My Glorious Prize: There a New Triumph shall compleat My Joys. How will My Mars be pleas'd, My God of War, When I in Publick shall My Trophies bear! With what Extatick Joy will Vulcan come To welcome His Successful Part'ner Home! But e're I go, One Secret I'll declare, Which Thou'lt with Pleasure, and with Wonder hear. Thou art no Shepherd, but a Monarch's Son, And thro' Thy Veins Great Priam's Blood does run. Therefore, No more the Flow'ry Plains frequent, But let Thy Thoughts on Nobler Views be bent. Go, bid Thy Gentle Nymphs and Swains Adieu, For Thou must Nobler Joys, and Brighter Charms pursue All Lesser Beauties Thou must now despise, And strive to captivate Fair Helen's Eyes. Fear not Success: To JOVE Thy Cause I'll move, And He will hear, for Thou'rt ally'd to JOVE. Be Bold, and with the Queen to Troy repair: I'll be Thy Guardian Goddess, and protect Thee there. Paris. Goddess Divine, My humblest Thanks I pay, And I'll with Joy Thy Kind Commands obey. This Moment I'll Oenone's Fetters break, And range the World for Fair Queen Helen's Sake. I lov'd Oenone while an Humble Swain: But now a Prince, I am Myself again. (He goes out with Venus Hand in Hand.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IX. Enter Juno and Pallas. Juno. Pallas, to JOVE I have complain'd in vain, Which gives Me, tho' Immortal, mortal Pain. I scarce can tell which 'tis provokes Me most, My Husband's Coldness, or My Wish thus crost. Pall. My Disappointment is as Great as Thine, Therefore with Force united let us join, To vex Our Rival, and Her Favourite Swain, And fill with Horror all the Trojan Plain. Juno. Agreed: To Menalaus strait I'll go, Rouse up his Wrongs, and teach him what to do: A Numerous Fleet the Spartans shall prepare, And plague Old Troy with a long tedious War. Pall. I like Your Thought: Your Motion's wond'rous Good: Troy shall be ransack'd, and be dy'd with Blood. Tell him that Pallas will direct his Arms, Espouse his Cause, and save him from all Harms. Amidst his Fleet Invisible I'll be, And crown him with Undoubted Victory. Soon to his Cost, the Proud, Imperious Boy Shall wish he'd never heard, or thought of Troy; Wish he had never the Fair Helen seen, Or to Oenone false, and faithless been: Soon shall he own, and that with Weeping Eyes, That Pallas should have had the Golden Prize. (They go out together.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE X. Enter Oenone Weeping, and Florinda following Her. Flor. Think, think no more on the False, Perjur'd Swain; He's fled to Troy, and all thy Sighs are vain. No more lament thy Cruel, Wayward Fate; Strephon's more Constant, tho' He's not so Great: Strephon with Pride would the Youth's Place supply, Adore thy Charms, and for Oenone dye. Oeno. O! Name him not: I hate th'Ambitious Swain; Long has he su'd indeed, but su'd in Vain. No;âSince my Once-lov'd Paris proves Untrue, I'll bid the Groves, and all the Swains Adieu. How oft has He invok'd the Powers Divine To witness He'd be Constant, ever Mine! What Cruel Stars his Kindness to prevent, Curs'd him with Pow'r, and ruin'd my Content! Whisper'd Renown and Glory in his Ear, And cry'd, Let Helen be thy Only Care! Forsake the Plains, thy Shepherd's Weeds lay down; Change Crooks for Scepters, Garlands for a Crown! Oh! Fatal Pomp, that could so soon divide What Love, and All our Vows so firmly ty'd! Farewel, Florinda, I must now be gone. Flor. Whither, Oh! whither would Oenone run? Oeno. Boldly I'll venture on some Land Unknown, It cannot use me worse than this has done. In Distant Climes I will my Fate deplore On a Lone Isle, or some forsaken Shoar; Where I may listen to False Man no more. Flor. Couldst thou then go, and leave me here behind? Oenone sure could ne're be so Unkind. To part with Thee my Bleeding Heart would break; I love the Groves, but for Oenone's sake. Oeno. Then thus United, let's together fly; (They join Hands.) Live Vestal Virgins, Vestal Virgins dye. Since Crowns and Falshoods are Consistent Things, Since Some are Base, and Perjur'd who are Kings, I'll envy not my Shepherd's Prosp'rous Fate, Nor wish with Loss of Virtue to be Great. FINIS.</field>
