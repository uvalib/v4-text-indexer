      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, the Capitol, at Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. CÃSAR, ANTHONY. ANTHONY. Now, CÃ¦sar, royalty is thine, at length The glorious period is arrived, when Rome Ever to thy deserts unjust, each thought By thy transcendent virtue changed, shall own, Beholding thee, her guardian, her avenger, Her conqueror, and her king; within this breast, Envy, thy soul can witness, is unknown. Most true to CÃ¦sar, I have prized his fame Beyond himself. These hands have forged the chain Which thou shalt brace upon the neck of Rome, Well-pleased to be the second of mankind. Prouder in fixing on thy head the crown, Greater and more illustrious, serving thee, Than to possess th'imperial rule, and call These dignities my own.âHah! answer'st thou, But with that deep-drawn sigh? Dost thou repine, Contemplating those honours, which I view With exultation? Absolute o'er Rome, Her King, and mighty master of the world, Canst thou complain? Alas! Can CÃ¦sar mourn? Can CÃ¦sar fear? What can inspire with terror A soul like thine? CÃSAR. Affection, Anthony. Yes, thou selected of my heart, attend, Nought will I hide from thee. By fate decreed, On Babylonia's hostile plains, thou know'st I soon shall spread my banners; the disgrace Of Crassus, and the lasting shame of Rome, Prepared t'avenge upon the barbarous Parthian. My war-desiring eagle check'd so long, Now struggles to be free, and aims his flight T'ward the hoarse Bosphorus. My veterans, tried In many a field, wait but to view the crown Circling my brow, the signal of their march. Perhaps a country, which to Philip's son Yielded so tamely, CÃ¦sar may attempt, Without imputed rashness, to subdue. Haply th'intrepid Gauls, heroic Pompey, And all his legions Roman-born, compared With subjugated Persia, may be rated High in account; at least my bosom dares Cherish th'idea. Neither can thy friend Banish the conscious thought, that he whose arms Vanquish'd the Rhine, shall triumph o'er th'Euphrates. But tho' his soul hope elevates, unveil'd Is reason's eye.âWisdom the most profound, Is oft deceiv'd.âFortune at length may cease My footsteps to pursue, and wearied turn Back from the course; she may abandon CÃ¦sar, As Pompey fell a victim to her snares. For mid tumultuous factions, as in battle, An almost imperceptive line is drawn Between defeat and victory. Forty years Are now elapsed, a space of time, in which I rose thro' patient service, to command, And the full blaze of military glory. The subject world hath bent to my controul, Its doom awaiting, and I still have mark'd In each bold effort, that the fate of nations Depended on an instant.âAccidents No foresight can elude; but well I know, Fear and this heart shall ever more be strangers; That I will vanquish without arrogance, Or die without a murmur.âBut, by all The laws of tender friendship, Oh! remain United with my children! Fix the bond Indissoluble! To thy sway, and theirs, May Rome, by me defended and subdued, May the whole earth, yield homage! And the name, The glorious name of King, on me bestow'd, To them, and thee descend! Oh, Anthony! My heart's fond wish, my last request at parting, Is, that my sons in thee may find a father; Shall I insult thee by demanding oaths? I ask them not, sureties of human faith, Holy and vain. Thy promise is the best, The firmest tie; that, I believe more pure, Than altars consecrated to the gods, Which throngs of perjured votaries surround. ANTHONY. Hard is the fate of Anthony, that thou Must seek the paths of war and death without him; That for thy service, he, in Italy Must dwell immew'd, while glory guides thy steps To Asia's confines. But thy noble heart Thus doubting fortune, and presaging ills, More sensibly affects me.âTo thy kindness Wounding each finer nerve, how can my tongue Form a reply? Mysterious all it seems! Didst thou not talk of sons? And bid me share Empire with them? I know no son of thine, Except Octavius, none but him adopted, No other CÃ¦sar to protect thy line. CÃSAR. The time, my friend, no longer will permit me To hide from thee the bitterness of grief Preying in secret on a father's heart. Octavius, by the laws, not otherwise, Is now my son, he bears the name of CÃ¦sar, And was the object of my choice. But fate (Shall I pronounce it cruel, or benign?) Hath made me father to a real son; One whom I dearly love, but who (so great Is my misfortune) all my tenderness Beholds with fix'd aversion. ANTHONY. Who is he? This son? With such ingratitude possess'd! So little worthy of the blood, from which High Heaven decreed his birth! CÃSAR. Attend! Thou know'st Th'unhappy Brutus, train'd to savage virtue By the stern lore of Cato. The severe Unyielding champion of our ancient laws. The rigid foe of arbitrary power, Ever to me adverse; he drew the sword, And where my various enemies arose, Was always the most active in their service. My captive in the fields of Thessaly, Whose life, against his will, I twice preserved; Born at a distance from me, and among My most inveterate adversaries bred. ANTHONY. Brutus! Can heâ CÃSAR. Trust not my words alone. Read this. ANTHONY. Ye powers above! Servilia! Cato's aspiring sister! CÃSAR. We in private, By marriage were united. When our first Of feuds began, relentless in his wrath, Cato, not even waiting for my absence, Forced her to wed another. But the day Which saw these rites, saw her new spouse expire. Under the name of Brutus, this my son, His uncle educated.âGracious Heaven! Was he reserved to persecute me still With hate unceasing!âBut that letter read, And see the whole disclosed. ANTHONY [Reads.] âCÃ¦sar, I feel approaching death.âThe gods âWill, in their anger, soon dissolve at once âMy life and love. Yet recollect, that Brutus, âFrom thee derives his being.âOh, farewel! âAnd may that true affection, which the mother âIn her last moments for his father feels, âEver inspire the bosom of the son! Servilia.â And art thou by the stern decree of fate, Cursed with a son so much unlike thyself? CÃSAR. He hath his virtues of a different kind. His lofty spirit, e'en while it offends, Flatters the daring temper of my own; It stings me, yet imparts a secret pleasure. His generous independency of soul Amazes me, my dazzled senses shrink As bright in his proud sphere he soars. His firm Undaunted mind o'erpowers me, and I pardon His glowing language, when inveighing keen Against the sovereign sway which I assume, Either as man and father I am led By some seductive charm, with partial eyes To view his actions in their happiest light, And thus delude myself. Or, born a Roman, Spite of all obstacles, the patriot voice Will speak within and fix upon my heart The stain of tyranny. Or else more strong Than my weak efforts, that all-potent freedom, Which I would subjugate, inspires my breast With sentiments of warm affection t'ward him. Nay more, if Brutus owes to me his birth, The son of CÃ¦sar must abhor a master. In my first earliest years I thought like him, Sylla with detestation I beheld, Nor could I bear the hated name of tyrant. Myself had been a citizen, if Pompey, That proud imperious man, had not usurp'd All honours, arrogating to himself The palm of fame, and striving to depress My equal claim to glory; born with pride, Born with ambition, yet a friend to virtue, Were I not CÃ¦sar, by th'immortal gods, I would be Brutus.âBut where'er it towers, Strain'd to whatever height, the soul of man Finds it a necessary task to bend To his condition. When he knows his birth, Even the tongue of Brutus, soon will speak A different language. Fate ordains a crown To grace his brow; will not the thought of this Relax the stubborn ruggedness within? It will. His manners with his change of fortune Will be new-moulded. Nature, blood, my favours, Thy kind advice, his interest, and his duty, Will all conspire to give me back my son. ANTHONY. I doubt it. Well I know his savage firmness. His sect admits not of th'impassion'd heart, Nor suffers it to feel; intractable, Making its boast to harden the stern soul Against the soft impressions of humanity; To overcome and trample under foot Indignant nature; to this sect alone Brutus attends, and only heeds its dictates. Opinions, which to reason's eye appear Shocking and monstrous, but by them stiled duty, With absolute dominion tyrannize Over their iron bosoms.âCato's self, That hapless stoic, that romantic hero, Who fell a sacrifice at Utica, Rather than condescend to be forgiven, Preferring death before thy tender friendship; E'en Cato was less haughty, less severe, And threaten'd less of danger, than the man Whom thy exalted generosity Would fain compel to gratitude and love. CÃSAR. What say'st thou? Dost thou know, my friend, what pangs Thy words impart? ANTHONY. Affection prompts my tongue I cannot flatter thee. CÃSAR. Yet all things own Time's mollifying power. ANTHONY. My mind despairs Of its success. CÃSAR. What! will his hateâ ANTHONY. Believe meâ CÃSAR. Enough of this!âI am his father still. Have I not sav'd my most inveterate foes? Nay strain'd them to my breast? And must I not Covet with warmest wish t'acquire the love Of Rome, and of my son? Oh, rapturous thought! Having subdued each inimical heart, (Triumph sublime of mercy!) to behold Willing adorers of my sovereign power The world, and Brutus!âThine it is, to aid me In this great purpose; thou hast lent thy arm, Copartner in my victories o'er mankind, Now gain a victory over Brutus; bend, Soften his fierce reluctant soul; prepare By slow degrees his wild unpolisht virtue For that important secret, which must soon Be to his ears disclosed, but which my mind Labouring with anxious doubt hath never yet Dared to reveal. ANTHONY. What would I not attempt At thy request? but here I can perceive No ground of hope, the trial will be vain. SCENE II. CÃSAR, ANTHONY, DOLABELLA. DOLABELLA. CÃ¦sar, the senators await thy pleasure, And ask an audience. CÃSAR. Slow hath been their meeting. Let them approach. ANTHONY. They come: on every brow What desperate hatred and fix'd malice lours. SCENE III. CÃSAR, ANTHONY, BRUTUS, CASSIUS, CIMBER, DECIMUS, CINNA, CASCA, &amp;c. LICTORS. CÃSAR [Sitting.] Ye guardians of the Roman greatness, hail! Joint-labourers with your CÃ¦sar! Cimber, Cassius, Cinna, and Decimus, and thou, my Brutus! At length the time is come, when favouring Heaven Lending its aid, I hasten to complete The conquest of the world. Our arms shall pierce To th'utmost Orient, and the throne of Cyrus From its proud height dejected, shall appease The ghost of Crassus. Now the time is come When war's undoubted right shall give to Rome The third remaining portion of the globe. All is prepared, and all, which prudence can, To crown with glory this vast enterprize, Hath been foreseen. Euphrates chides my stay. The opening dawn beholds us on our march. Brutus, and Cassius, you accompany Our progress to the East. The government Of Italy and Gaul, to Anthony We have allotted. On th'Atlantic shore, And o'er the plains where Betis flows, shall Cimber The tributary monarchs awe. We give Lycia, and Greece to Decimus. The realm Of Pontus, is the delegated trust Of thee, Marcellus. Casca shall bear sway O'er Syria's rich domain.âThus having fix'd The fate of distant nations, and composed Intestine quarrels, seeing Latium blest With happiness and peace, it now remains For the consulting senate to determine, What title shall be mine, decreed the head Of Rome, and of the universe. The name Of consul, Marius bore; more splendid still, That of dictator Sylla graced; and Pompey Was imperator.âI have conquer'd last. And suffer me t'affirm, a new-raised empire Claims a new title to adorn its founder. A name more great, more sacred, obvious less To change, revered of old in Rome, and dear To every realm beside.âFame long hath spread And the tradition is believed thoughout Th'extensive earth, that we in vain shall dare Assail the Parthians, that a king alone Shall conquer, and subject them to his will. CÃ¦sar is destined to this arduous task, But CÃ¦sar is no king; he boasts no rank But that of citizen, tho' by the state Distinguished for his services. No bar Secures him from the light capricious croud, And their impetuous ever-shifting passions. You understand me, Romans,âto your minds My hopes are known; reflect on my deserts, Consider well my power. CIMBER. Thy speech demands An answer, nor shall Cimber fear to speak. These kingdoms, governments, and provinces, The purchase of our toil; the universe Thus canton'd out, would in the people's eyes, Would by the jealous senate be esteem'd A public outrage to the state, to us No benefit, no favour.âMarius, Sylla, Carbo, nor Pompey, in the proudest hour Of their usurp'd authority, e'er dared Bestow our conquests thus with lavish hand, And make their will the law, much less assume A language kings might use to their dependents. No, CÃ¦sar, from thy clemency of heart And native generosity, we thought A gift more precious to receive, a boon By justice consecrated, far above The realms so bounteously conferr'd upon us. CÃSAR. What gift would Cimber covet? CIMBER. Liberty. CASSIUS. Thy promise, nay thy solemn oath, was given, For ever to destroy tyrannic power. I deem'd the happy moment now arrived, When the world's conqueror would have satisfied Our hearts fond warmest wishes. From its ruins, Steaming with blood, enslaved, and desolate, Rome in that hope, again uprear'd her head, Saw peace advance, and plenty smile around. She has a prior right,âwe are her children. I know thy power; forget not thou thy oaths. BRUTUS. Let CÃ¦sar still be great, but Rome be free. Gods! shall she stretch her sway to distant Ind, On Tiber's banks a slave! ah! what avails Her mighty name to which the prostrate world Submissive bends, or the vain-glorious boast Of sovereign rule, if doom'd to bear the weight Of ignominous fetters!âOh, my country! What will it profit thee, to be inform'd That CÃ¦sar hath acquired new troops of slaves! Perhaps we ought not to esteem the Parthians As our worst foes; we may have those whom more We ought to dread.âEnough.âLet this suffice. CÃSAR. And thou too, Brutus! ANTHONY, to CÃSAR. Mark their insolence, And say if e'er ingratitude like this Deserv'd a pardon? CÃSAR. Rash, unthinking men! Are you to its extremest verge resolved To urge my patience? and to weary out My oft repeated bounty? Who are mine By right of conquest, by my sword obtain'd? Who crouch'd when Marius frown'd? and lowly bow'd The slaves of Pompey? You, who only breathe Till my impetuous wrath, too long restrain'd, Dart headlong down upon its trembling quarry? Ungrateful levellers, where republic zeal Stifles each milder duty; your example Hardens my breast, and turns to flint a heart, The seat of clemency.âBefore the face Of Sylla, how reserved you stood! how mute! He fix'd a curb on your licentious tongues. But now you take advantage of my nature, My generosity of soul gives birth To all these insults, unwithheld by fear, Because you know that CÃ¦sar scorns revenge. Hence you presume to brave me with the sounds Of Rome, and of your country; hence derive This affectation of superior greatness; Hence dare these turgid sentiments produce Before your conqueror. These arms, no doubt, This spirit to Pharsalia's plains you brought. Fate haply drew the line betwixt us there With an unequal hand. Yet seems it just To me, that those who knew not how to conquer, Should learn to serve. BRUTUS. We all had learn'd to die, That stands unquestion'd. Nor in Thessaly, Did one of us his manly soul debase, And ask to live.âProtracted life is ours, Thy gift, protracted to be render'd vile. Oh! how detested! if we must submit Implicitly to CÃ¦sar's sovereign will! No; rather in thy fury let us fall! Perish together!âHaste! begin with me! If thy determination is to reign, Strike, strike at once! CÃSAR. My answer thou shalt have In private.âNow let all retire. [The Senators go out. Oh, Brutus! Could I expect these taunting words from thee? Know'st thou, like poison'd arrows, how they pierce My inmost soul?âThy life! Alas! his own Is not more dear to CÃ¦sar. From the senate, And their blind erring rage, let deeds arise So fell and horrible.âOh! leave me not. Thou hast the power to charm all anger from me, And thou alone.âOh, Brutus! leave me not. Of all things to be wish'd, there is but one Which CÃ¦sar asks, thy confidence and love. BRUTUS. My heart, the blood in every vein is thine, If thou regard thy promise. If thy mind Is bent on tyranny, I from me cast With deep abhorrence and contempt thy friendship. I cannot stay with Anthony and thee, With those who banish all the Roman from them, Covet false grandeur, and demand a king. SCENE IV. CÃSAR, ANTHONY. ANTHONY. Have I deceived thee? Dost thou think the ties Most dear to nature, can engage a heart So proud? So rigid? Leave, for ever leave In its obscurity the fatal secret Which weighs thus heavy on thy generous mind. Let him, determined as he is, lament The fall of Rome, but at whose head he points The vengeful shaft, of that let him remain In total ignorance. From CÃ¦sar sprung, Warp'd from his high descent, he merits not The glorious consanguinity. Ungrateful To all thy bounty, all thy tender love Repaying with ingratitude, cast off These weaker feelings; and renounce the son. CÃSAR. It is impossible, I cannot banish The affection of a parent. ANTHONY. Banish then Far from thy thoughts the splendour which around Circles the diadem! Retread the steps By which I saw thee to the dazzling sane Of glory climb, and press the vulgar earth Thy milkiness of nature ill accords With uncontroul'd authority, it mars Thy greatness, and ambition's workmanship Unseemly levels. Having bent the neck Of haughty Rome, wilt thou thus tamely bear The insolence of Cassius? Shall this Cimber, This Cinna, unimportant as they are, The lowest of the senate, dare assume These airs of self-sufficiency before The master of the universe? Shall these Dare brave thy power? or live to check the will Of him who conquer'd them? to whom they owe Profound submission? CÃSAR. They were born my equals; Struggling in war I vanquish'd them; and placed So high above their station, I excuse Their idly striving to shake off a yoke By me imposed. ANTHONY. Less precious had their blood Been in the eyes of Marius; Sylla's hand Had long e'er now fall'n heavy on them. CÃSAR. Sylla Was a barbarian, cruelty inspired Each thought, each action. Massacre alone, And savage fury form'd his politics And all his greatness. Circled with a band Of executioners, he govern'd Rome. He was the terror of his country, CÃ¦sar Would be her pleasure, and her dear delight. I know the people, in a day they change; As reigns caprice, they deal around their hate Or love with equal ease, profuse of both. If my exalted rank provokes the sense Of envy in them, by my generous deeds Attracted, their affections still are mine. To pardon those who cannot injure us, Is no mistaken policy; tho' bound In strongest fetters, by the semblance won Of liberty, their weak erroneous minds Regard me as its patron. It is right, Above the pit to which I lure them on, To scatter flowers, with gentle management To soothe the tiger when around his limbs We brace the chain, to please him when he feels The galling load, and charm him to submission. Let CÃ¦sar from the bosom of his rivals Force their esteem; be this their punishment. ANTHONY. Force thou their dread; know, to be fear'd and reign, Are terms synonimous. CÃSAR. Away! no dread, No fears would I inspire, but in the field, And the stern hour of battle. ANTHONY. Soon the people Will find thy easy temper and abuse it. CÃSAR. The people! No. It is their general wish T'immortalize my bounty. See the temple, Which Rome to CÃ¦sar's clemency hath raised! ANTHONY. I see it well. Another she e'er long May raise to vengeance; tremble at the thought! Tremble, reflecting on these men, whose hearts Are ulcerated deep, while fell despair Feeds th'ever-rankling sore! Idolaters Of Roman freedom, and from principle Steel'd with remorseless cruelty. The soul Of Cassius is alarm'd, his jealous eyes Behold me placing on thy brow this day The hated diadem; e'en in thy presence Already have they dared to manifest Their sullen discontent. Prudence requires To gain the warmest of them to our side, The most impetuous of these zealots. Deign At least to hide thy purpose for a while, And thus elude the danger of that stroke They seem to meditate. CÃSAR. Could I have stoop'd To fear, I would have stoop'd to punish them. Let not thy counsels urge me on to deeds On which abhorrence waits. I know to fight, I know to conquer, but severity I cannot, will not know.âCome, let us hence, Dead be suspicion! in her blood-stain'd cave Let vengeance sleep! Nor barbarous force extend O'er the submissive world her iron rod! END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. BRUTUS, ANTHONY, DOLABELLA. ANTHONY. The pride, the rancorous ill-will betray'd In this refusal, less th'impression bears Of virtue's aweful image, than of rude Ferocious manners. CÃ¦sar's generous kindness, But above all, his power, might claim, methinks, More of respect, a more complying will. To talk with him, at least, e'en Brutus self Might condescend. Ah! didst thou know t'ward whom Thou hast presumed to foster this resentment, Didst thou but know, how would thy shuddering heart.â BRUTUS. I shudder now, but from thy language springs Th'impassion'd feeling. Enemy to Rome, Which thou hast sold, can thy vain fancy hope By guile, or by corruption, to o'ercome The firm resolves of Brutus?âHence, away! But unaccompanied by me; go, cringe Under th'uplifted scourge! I know the scope Of Anthony's designs, how low he bends, And pants to be a slave.âA king thy aim! And thou of Roman birth! ANTHONY. A human heart At least is mine, and Brutus must confess, That I was born susceptible of friendship. Ne'er have I strove with curious search to gain Those rare-existing qualities of mind, Which, deem'd all-powerful to complete the heroe, Form but a stern barbarian, whose fierce temper, And haughtiness, unyielding and unmoved, Pollute that virtue which he boasts t'enjoy, And make her beauties loathsome. SCENE II. BRUTUS alone. What baseness, Heaven! What ignominy! See, My wretched country, your protectors! See What successors are yours, Horatius, Decius, And thou, th'avenger of our laws, whose blood Beats in this kindred heart, unrivall'd Brutus! What poor remains, just gods! of the once great, Once aweful majesty of Rome! Before The hand which braces on our chains we crouch Abject, and trembling. All is CÃ¦sar's, allâ Our very virtues he hath ravish'd from us, And in the midst of Roman citizens I seek for Rome in vain.âYou, whom these eyes Have seen expire, whose fortitude still lives, And shall to the end of time! You truly great! Whose statues I approach, while down my cheek Rolls the warm tear of sympathy and love! Pompey's illustrious, and untainted race! Thou, divine Cato! Thou, the last whose veins Th'heroic blood of Scipio fill'd! from you On me descending, spring again to life The sparks of those bright virtues which so strong Enkindled your immortal souls, you still Survive in Brutus; you, within my bosom Have stored up all that honour, which the tyrant Hath from the Roman name unseemly torn. What do I view? What paper, at the foot Of Pompey's statue placed? My name it bears, What is its import?ââDost thou sleep then Brutus, âAnd Rome in fetters?ââNo, I do not sleep,â My eyes are always open, Rome, for thee. Cast not on me the vile reproach of bonds Which I detest. Another scroll?ââNo longer âBoast thou the name, thou art not Brutus.ââGods? How keen the taunt! deep, deep it pierces here. Now, CÃ¦sar! tyrant! tremble! it is fix'd. Thy mortal wound behold!ââThou art not Brutus!â I am, by earth and Heaven above, I am, I will be Brutus. I devote myself To death, my countrymen, to glorious death, Or you shall live free as the air you breathe, Unshackled by a master.âI perceive With joy, that Rome still fosters virtuous hearts. She calls aloud for vengeance, upon me She turns her eyes, she stimulates my soul, And nerves with double strength this tardy hand; She calls for blood,âher voice determines,âRome, Thou shalt be satisfied. SCENE III. BRUTUS, CASSIUS, CINNA, CASCA, DECIMUS, Attendants. CASSIUS. This, Brutus, is our last embrace. The hour Is come, my friends, and we must fall beneath The ruin of our laws; henceforth from CÃ¦sar No favour I expect; he knows my thoughts; He is not ignorant how far we dare. Our souls, invincible by base corruption, Have with astonishment his plans o'erwhelm'd. But soon will he awake; our deaths succeed, The last of Romans perish. I behold The fated time complete; the love of country, Of honour, of the laws, exists no more; From her foundations Rome herself is torn; This day she sinks beneath his feet; he triumphs Over mankind, he triumphs over Rome. For him alone our thoughtless ancestors Thro' danger rush'd to conquest. The proud spoils Of hostile kings, the sceptre of the world, Six hundred years of virtue, toils, and war, Were but a stake for CÃ¦sar, he hath won All at a cast, and with rank appetite Devours those precious fruits, which scarce six ages, Ages of matchless glory, could produce. Oh, Brutus! Wert thou born for servitude? Freedom is lost,âquench'd is its vital flame. BRUTUS. Rather it is prepared again to rise, And more intensely blaze. CASSIUS. What dost thou say?â Hark!âWhence these sudden shouts! BRUTUS. The worthless herdâ It is their clamorous voice. Regard them not. CASSIUS. Did'st thou not say that freedomâHark! the shouts Are louder still. SCENE IV. BRUTUS, CASSIUS, CIMBER, DECIMUS. CASSIUS. What means this tumult, Cimber? Can'st thou inform us? DECIMUS. Who, our suffering country, Wounds with fresh insults? What hast thou beheld? CIMBER. Rome's everlasting shame. This idol proud, This CÃ¦sar, I beheld him in the temple Seated aloft, as rivalling the god Who lightens from the capitol. That place He chose, t'unfold his arrogant design, Of joining Persia to the Roman empire. The people hail'd him with each glorious name, War's thunder-bolt, avenger of his country, And conqueror of the world. But loaded thus With honours, his exorbitant ambition Was not content, another title still Remain'd behind. When Anthony was seen, Amid these shouts, and loud acclaims of joy, Advancing through the multitude, and soon He gain'd the temple. Oh, disgrace! Oh, crime! Sinking a Roman e'en beneath contempt! He gain'd the temple, bearing in his hand A crown and sceptre. All at once was hush'd,â A sudden tremor thro' th'assembly ran; While he, with insolence unparallel'd, Unaw'd, and unabash'd, the diadem Placed on the head of CÃ¦sar, to the ground Bent his submissive knees, and cried aloud, Reign, CÃ¦sar! o'er th'extensive earth bear sway! And o'er a grateful people!âAt these words, You might have seen a deadly paleness spread On each beholder's cheek; the vaulted roof Rang with their lamentations; horror-struck Some wildly fled; here others blushing stood With honest shame; some pour'd forth tears of grief Mingled with rage.âCÃ¦sar, who plainly read In every visage these expressive marks Of indignation, his dissembled part, Long conn'd within his mind, now acted, threw Down at his feet the regal ornaments, And trampled on them.âThen what pleasure reign'd! The giddy multitude beheld at once Their liberty confirm'd, wild transport rose, And they were drunk with fond fantastic joy. Anthony stood astonish'd.âCÃ¦sar feign'd A well-becoming modesty, and blush'd. The more he labour'd to conceal from them His real feelings, their exulting voice Praised him the more.âHis criminal intent Was cover'd thus beneath the specious shew Of moderation: his refusal seem'd As sprung from genuine magnanimity; Vile, painful affectation all!âIn secret, Spite of his efforts, deeply pierced the sting; Deep, tho' not audibly, he groan'd, to hear Those praises lavishly bestow'd on virtues Which never graced his soul.âIn short, unable His struggling passions longer to restrain, The capitol he left, while on his brow Sat sullen discontent. Then gave his orders, That in an hour the senate should attend him. Fix'd, Brutus, is the time: one little hour, The period limited, when CÃ¦sar's will Shall regulate the govenment, and all Our valued rights destroy. The senate, once So just, and sacred, is corrupted, bought With CÃ¦sar's gold; with that, the larger half Have purchased Rome; and sold again to him The bargain of their infamy. More base Than are the lowest of the multitude, Who, doom'd to poverty and woe, still hear At least the name of king, with some degree Of inward horror.âCÃ¦sar, who already Possesses all the substance, all the power Of royalty, is anxious for a crown. The people have refused him, but the senate Will gratify his wishes.âWhat remains? On what shall we determine? Say, my brave, My noble countrymen? CASSIUS. On deathâTo finish A life, the days of which are only number'd By shame, succeeding shame. Its heavy chain I have dragg'd on, while the least ray of hope Beam'd on my country. Now eternal night Closes around, and unavoidably My being ends with hers. Let those who will, Hang o'er her ashes their dejected heads, And drop the loyal tear. I cannot raise The arm of vengeance, but I can expire, And mix with Rome in death.âI go where dwell Our gods, and demi-godsâO Scipio! Pompey! No more I hesitate your steps to tread; And imitate the glorious deed of Cato. BRUTUS. No, CassiusâLet us generously scorn Th'ignoble copyer's part. 'Tis ours to set A bright example to succeeding times. From us the world, suspended, even now Expects its fate.âO valour's chosen band! Friends of my soul! from us our country claims Actions to justify her veneration, And all that grateful love, with which (tho' ruin'd) She will our memories cherish.âHad my words Prevail'd with Cato, in his brave despair More just, he would have seen the tyrant's blood Commingled with his own. Against himself He turn'd his blameless hand. No good from thence Flow'd to mankind. Cato did all for glory; For her he died, and not for Rome. There err'd, And there alone, his high-aspiring soul. CASSIUS. In this dread hour what course shall we pursue? And what is thy advice? BRUTUS. Behold! and read! To me alone directed.âWe from this May all be taught our duty. [Shews the paper. CASSIUS. To my hands Reproaches similar have been convey'd. BRUTUS. And have we not deserved them? CIMBER. It draws nearâ The fatal crisis. In an hour the tyrant Gives the last blow to Roman liberty. BRUTUS. An hour, and CÃ¦sar in his bosom feels The dagger's point. CASSIUS. Hah! there the mighty soul Of Brutus spake. The nobly-daring thought Proclaims the words his own. DECIMUS. Intrepid foe Of arbitrary power! On thy great race Reflecting lustre! kindred sentiments Invigorate this breast. CASSIUS. Again I breathe. Again th'emancipated spirits rush Thro' their known channels. What due thanks? What praise Can Cassius render thee? But this I own, My hate of tyranny, my indignation, Expected, from that strong and manly virtue, Unequall'd, and peculiar to thyself. Surely Rome's aweful genius hath inspired Th'exalted purpose. In the name of Brutus Some mystic power resides, announcing stern The death of tyrants. Let us purge, my friend, The earth, and wash off its opprobrious stain! Let us avenge the capitol, nor wait Till bursts the lingering thunder! Cimber! Cinna! Ye Romans of unconquerable mould! Are ye divided in your wills from us? Beat not your bosoms with the same desires? CIMBER. True are our hearts, and own the mutual flame; Communicated ardour. We despise A life of baseness. We contemplate CÃ¦sar With fix'd abhorrence; for we love our country. We will not halt, with prompt alacrity Ready to join in vengeance. Is there aught Of Roman virtue extant, it must hear Brutus, and Cassius, from its slumbers rise, And shine, with vital energy relumed. DECIMUS. Born to decide on all that may affect The public weal; all criminals to judge, And punish guilt; too long have we beheld Oppression's hand stretch'd forth. While every breath The tyrant draws, each intervening moment Hind'ring the stroke of justice, is in us A crime, for which we merit punishment. CIMBER. Shall we invite any to share with us In this great enterprize? BRUTUS. And need we more T'avenge our country than this chosen number? Emilius, Dolabella, Lepidus, And Bibulus, are either overcome With fear, and tremble under CÃ¦sar's power, Or stoop before him, voluntary slaves, Bought with his gold. For Cicero, tho' (most true) He by his prudent care traced out the scheme Of the most daring traitor to his country, By punishment o'ertaken; liberty Cannot expect from him a strong support. His flowing eloquence it may command; Bold in the senate, in the desperate hour Of peril, feeble; born with art, with grace, T'harangue, but not avenge deep-injured Rome. Leave to the orator, who charms his country, The task of praising us, when we have done her Essential service. No, I covet not A soul but you, with whom I would partake This honour more than mortal, this extreme Of dangerous resolution. In an hour The tyrant enters in the senate house, There will I punish, there surprise him, there Plunge in his guilty breast this hallow'd steel; Revenging Cato's death, illustrious Pompey, And every Roman citizen. Say that peril Most imminent, awaits th'attempt! that placed In every corner of the capitol His watchful guards cast round their prying eyes! The people yielding to each new impression, Fluttering, and bending, osier-like, in doubt Whether they ought to love, admire, or hate Their plausible enslaver? O my friends! We seem to rush on certain death. But, heaven! How glorious, how supremely to be wish'd That death! to fall, endeavouring to fulfil A purpose so sublime! to see our blood Mingled, and streaming with the blood of tyrants! Yes, brave associates, we devote ourselves To death, but with us CÃ¦sar likewise dies. While freedom by th'oppression of his crimes Long smother'd, from its ashes shall again Rise undecay'd, and shine thro' endless years. CASSIUS. Away then with debate! Let us at once Ascend the capitol; in all his pride There stands th'usurper; there we strike the blow; And immolate the victim. On the people Waste not a thought; if dubious now they seem, Let them behold their idol on the ground, And hear what execrations they will pour On the once-worship'd form! BRUTUS. Swear then with me! Swear on this sword! By Cato's spotless blood! By mighty Pompey's! by the sacred manes Of those true sons of Rome, who lifeless fell On Afric's torrid plains! By all the gods Avengers of our country! Swear that CÃ¦sar Shall stoop, and under your uplifted hands Sink breathless in the dust. CASSIUS. Let us, my friends, Beyond the tenor of this oath proceed; And swear, with ardent zeal t'exterminate All who hereafter o'er their kind shall dare To claim dominion; be they e'en the sons Born of our loins, our brothers, or our father, If tyrants, Brutus, let them in the list Be mark'd our bitterest foes! No son, no father The true republican acknowledges, But virtue, but the gods, the righteous laws, And his dear native country. BRUTUS. Truth inspires Thy tongue; henceforth for ever I unite My blood with yours; this instant let us join In blest relationship, adoption pure Either of other! Our firm kindred tie, The safety of the state, itself our true Undoubted parent, our oppressor's blood, Shall be the seal of these our heart-form'd bonds. [He advances towards the statue of Pompey. By you, intrepid and unshaken heroes, We vow! (whose statues in this aweful moment, This crisis of our duty, animate Our breasts with vigour) at thy sacred feet We vow, O Pompey! that each act of ours Is Rome's alone; the promptings of self-love Forever banisht from our thoughts! To stand Connected for the public weal, which seems In us already to be form'd again, And reassemble! All our vows we join, To live, to draw the keen-edged sword, or die In undissever'd union!âHaste! Prepare! Already have we been too prodigal Of irrecoverable time. SCENE V. CÃSAR, BRUTUS. CÃSAR. Brutus return! I would a while converse With thee in secret. Whither dost thou bend Thy hasty footsteps? BRUTUS. Far from tyranny. CÃSAR. Lictors, detain him. BRUTUS. Be the work complete, And take my life. CÃSAR. If, Brutus, in my wrath I thirsted for thy blood, I need but speak, And thou art mingled with the dead. Too well Hast thou deserved it; thy ingratitude And pride of heart is savagely intent Ever to thwart my views. Again I find thee Assembled with these Romans, whose designs And treacherous plots I more than guess; with these Who have so oft affronted me, dared blame My every measure, my resentment scorn. BRUTUS. They spake to thee, as Romans ought to speak. And wert thou by the gods inspired, their counsels. Would lead thee still. CÃSAR. Thy boldness I endure; Nay hear thee willingly; to thee descend Even with pleasure from my higher station. What layst thou to my charge? BRUTUS. A ravaged world; The blood of nations, and thy plunder'd country; Thy power; the very virtues which give birth To thy injustice, bound (as 'twere) in league, All thy attempts to render fortunate; That fatal clemency which gilds thy chains; A magic spell, wherewith to captivate Th'infatuated world. CÃSAR. All these reproaches Pompey had well deserved; who with the glare Of his pretended virtue dazzled thine. That haughty citizen, to Rome more fatal, Disdain'd to share equality of rank Even with CÃ¦sar. Think'st thou had he proved My conqueror, that his proud dilating soul Would e'er have suffer'd liberty to breathe? Thou too beneath his arbitrary yoke Must have bent low; what then had Brutus done? BRUTUS. He would have slain him. CÃSAR. And hast thou decreed Amid thy tow'ring thoughts this fate for me? No palliating word! O Brutus! Brutus! Thou livest for my destruction. BRUTUS. If thy mind Hath thus persuaded thee, prevent my fury, Say, what restrains thee? CÃSAR. Nature; and a heart Full of affection.âRead, ungrateful, read, And know what blood within thy adverse breast Is stirr'd 'gainst mine; see where thy hatred aims; And if thou canst, pursue its dictates still. BRUTUS. What do I see? where am I? do my eyes Deceive me? CÃSAR. Now, my son! my Brutus? BRUTUS. CÃ¦sar My father! O all-mighty gods! CÃSAR. I am in spite of thy ingratitudeâ With what ferocious silence.âOh! excuse meâ These sobs which burst forth from thy labouring bosomâ My son!âAnd do I hold thee mute within My straining arms? Hath nature then the power T'astonish onlyânot to soften thee? BRUTUS. Oh, dreadful fate!âI see despair before me. Oh, my late solemn oaths! Alas, my country! O Rome for ever dear!âIs CÃ¦sar?âHah! Wretch that I am, why hath my line of life Been stretch'd thus far? CÃSAR. Speakâspeakâwith what remorse Is thy heart torn asunder! Hide not aught From me.âStill wrapt in silence! dost thou dread To be esteem'd my son? the sacred name, Doth it offend thy ear? Art thou afraid That I shall lavish too much love upon thee? That I shall make thee partner of my rank? Alas! th'imperial sceptre of the world, The power supreme, this CÃ¦sar whom thou hatest, Hath coveted for thee.âWith thee, my son, And with the young Octavius, willingly Shall I divide those honours I have gain'd, The produce of an hundred victories, The regal title, and majestic sway. BRUTUS. O gods! CÃSAR. Fain would'st thou speak; and yet by force Restrain thy tongue from utterance! These emotions; Shall interpret them from tenderness, Or from aversion sprung? What secret thus Deep pent within thy bosom, seems t'o'erwhelm thee? BRUTUS. CÃ¦sar. CÃSAR. My son! I listen with impatience. BRUTUS. I cannot speak to him. CÃSAR. Still dost thou fear T'address me by the tender name of father? BRUTUS. If by that sacred tie I may invoke thee, Oh, grant me one request! CÃSAR. Say, what, my Brutus? To thee a favour granted, I shall think Absolute gain. BRUTUS. Doom me to death this instant! Or banish all ideas of a crown. CÃSAR. Oh, unrelenting enemy! whose fierceness Will tiger-like to no caresses yield, Unmoved by my affection! Know, thy heart Whence nature is expell'd, hath harden'd mine; And all a father's tenderness extinguish'd. Go, I renounce thee. Stern republican, Away! my breast with desperate rage inspired, Is taught by thy example, and the soul, Which thou hast wounded thus inhumanly, At length with thine shall cease to feel, and quell Reluctant nature.âGo, I was not born On minds like thine to waste with idle breath Intreaties vain; from Brutus I have learn'd To cast away humanity. No more CÃ¦sar declares thee his, or even knows thee. Loosed by my power from every chain, no more Will I to mercy yield opposing justice. With firm and steady calmness I obey The dictates of my wrath.âMy easy heart Is weary of forgiveness. From this time Sylla shall be my pattern, all his acts Of violence shall be renew'd by CÃ¦sar. Yes, let th'ungrateful tremble at th'effects Of my awaken'd vengeance. Hence, begone, Inhuman as thou art.âGo, meet again Thy base unworthy friends.âThey all have leagued T'abuse, insult me, and shall all experience My power and will to punish. They shall know Both what I can, and what I dare. Henceforth I am a convert to barbarity, and thou alone the cause. BRUTUS. Oh! thus inclinedâ I will not leave him to his cruel purpose; But save, if possible, my friends, and CÃ¦sar. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE. I. CASSIUS, CIMBER, DECIMUS, CINNA, CASCA, and the other Conspirators. CASSIUS. At length the time draws near, when Rome shall gain A new existence; this auspicious day The mistress of the world shall burst the bonds Of her usurping lord. To you belongs This unexampled glory, Cimber, Casca, Probus, and Decimus. A single hour Is the brief period of the tyrant's fate. What Cato, Pompey, Asia's powers combined, Fail'd to perform, our small determined band Shall execute, we shall avenge our country. While sounds like these shall strike th'astonish'd world, Respect ye sons of men, imperial Rome! Her chains exist no more. CIMBER. Connected by the strongest ties we stand Prepar'd to follow thee, to strike, to die. To live, if life with honour may be purchased; To serve the senate, levelling with the dust CÃ¦sar's ambition, or to fall ourselves. DECIMUS. But wherefore look we round in vain for Brutus? The mortal foe of this abhorred tyrant? Who prompted, and receiv'd our solemn oaths? Whose dagger must th'example give to ours? This tardiness methinks agrees not well With Cato's son-in-law.âYet may he not Be stopp'd by force? And CÃ¦sar have discoveredâ But see at length he comes.âImmortal gods, With what dejection in his aspect! CASSIUS. Brutus! My friend! what fatal accident o'erclouds The lustre of thy virtue? Is the tyrant Acquainted with it all? Is Rome betray'd? BRUTUS. Of the conspiracy against his life CÃ¦sar is ignorant: without suspicion, He still confides in you. DECIMUS. What then afflicts thee? BRUTUS. An evil unforeseen, a dreadful secret, Which known, will make you tremble. CASSIUS. Say, is death Decreed to us, or to the proud usurper? We all can die, but 'tis not our's to tremble. BRUTUS. No more; but hear; while I at least disclose What will amaze thee.âI confess his life To Rome, to you is forfeited; to kill him Is meritorious; 'tis a debt we owe To our posterity, and to the good Of all mankind. I fix'd the time, the means, The place, the very instant of his death. I claim'd the privilege to strike the first Most glorious blow; all is prepared.âNow learn That CÃ¦sar is my father. CIMBER. Thou his son! CASSIUS. The son of CÃ¦sar! DECIMUS. Oh! my suffering country! BRUTUS. In private he was wedded to Servilia; From which ill-omen'd marriage, I, most wretched, Derive my birth. CIMBER. And is it possible? Could the free blood which animates thy heart Flow from a tyrant's veins? CASSIUS. It cannot beâ From such an origin thou could'st not springâ Thy bosom glows with too much Roman virtue. BRUTUS. My shame (oh that it were not!) is most plain, Glaring and manifest. You see my friend The horror of my fate.âYet by my word, And by my solemn oath, that fate is yours; To your arbitrement shall I submit.â Which of you all hath strength of mind sufficient, And stoic fortitude, surpassing far Man's vulgar race, with justice to decide How Brutus ought to act? Be you my guides; All silent! All with downcast eyes! and Cassius, Is he too mute? Will no one, on the brink Of this abyss, lend me his succouring arm? None urge me by encouragement to follow Our predetermined course? Or from his store Produce one argument to separate My soul from guilt?âI see e'en Cassius trembles, And with astonishment.â CASSIUS. When I reflect Upon the counsel which I needs must give, I cannot choose but tremble. BRUTUS. Speak! CASSIUS. Were Brutus An ordinary citizen, my speech Should thus proceed; go serve, and tyrannize Beneath thy father! Level to its base The state, which conscience, honour, every tie, Bids thee support.âRome will hereafter find A favourable moment to destroy, Instead of one, two execrable traitors. But I am speaking to a different Brutus, Of elevated soul, inferior scarce To those of demigods and heroes old. That champion, in the cause of liberty Arm'd at all points, the mortal foe of tyrants; Whose heart, strong-braced, firm, and unchangeable, Hath purified the blood which CÃ¦sar gave, Nor left one drop of the corrupted mass To taint th'unsullied stream. To thee I speakâ And heed me well.âThou know'st with what a storm Fierce Catiline e'er now, what ruin dire, Threaten'd t'o'erwhelm his country? BRUTUS. Well, I know it. CASSIUS. If on the day, when with his felon hand He stood prepared to give to liberty Her desperate wound; if when the senate's voice Past sentence on the traitor, he had then Disclosed thy birth, and own'd thee for his son, Necessitated to decide 'twixt us And that detested monsterâSay, on which Would thy free choice have fallen? BRUTUS. Can Cassius ask me? Or think my mind would, in an instant changed, Have given the lie to every principle Of generous virtue? Ballancing between A single man, with infamy surcharged, And the strong love which bound me to my country? CASSIUS. There Brutus to himself prescribed his duty. There spake the senate, and with joy pronounced The fatal sentence.âThere his voice confirmed Rome's great deliverance.âBut within thy soul Dost thou those sad uneasy yearnings feel, Those doubts reluctant, and mysterious murmurs, Which vulgar prejudice ascribes to nature? Could CÃ¦sar by a word annihilate Thy patriot love? thy duty? faith? This secret, Or false, or true, having discovered to thee, And own'd thee for his son, will it avail T'abstract a tittle from his crimes? Is not Thy nature still essentially the same? Art thou less Brutus? Art thou less a Roman? Art thou less bound to us? thy heart, hand, life, Less justly ours? But say, thou art his son! Is not insulted Rome yet dearer to thee? And more thy mother? Are not each of us Leagu'd in one glorious cause, yet more thy brethren?â Within these ever-hallow'd precincts born, Foster'd by Scipio; by the guardian care Of Pompey raised to man; th'adopted son Of godlike Cato, and the friend of Cassiusâ What more can'st thou desire? These sacred titles, Whence spring thy truest ornament and fame, Another would disgrace. Say, that the tyrant, Urged on by passion, to his vile embrace Seduced Servilia and thus gave thee birthâ Is this of consequence? Oh! let the follies And inconsiderate union of thy mother Rest undisturbed in their obscurity.â Who formed thy soul to virtue? Who begot The love of freedom in thy glowing breast? And all thy nobleness of manners? Cato. He only is thy father, who thy worth Intrinsic moulded, and to light call'd forth Th'ethereal part of thee.âBreak then at once The ties by him whose very name I loathe This day imposed. Now rouse up all thy firmness, With the bold tenor of our mutual oaths Greatly to correspond: nor seek for parents, But mind th'avengers of an harrast world. BRUTUS. And what, my gallant friends, is your opinion? CIMBER. By Cassius judge of us, by us of Cassius. Could other sentiments inspire our souls, Of all the sons of Rome, superior guilt Would be our portion. But appeal not thou To others; Brutus should consult himself, And his own heart alone. BRUTUS. Oh! friends!âmy bosom Shall now be all unfolded to your view. It is a book of horror to be read, And crouded thick with blackest characters. I will not hide from you a single thought. My inmost soul is shock'd, and tears have flow'd, The tears of anguish from a stoic's eye, After our mutual oath, which now appears Of dreadful import as it tended not To serve the state alone, but slay my father. Mourning our fatal consanguinity, Ashamed to be the subject of his kindness, Th'admirer of his virtues, the severe Judge of his crimes, viewing the man from whom My being I derive, o'erwhelm'd with guilt, Yet great in arms, and of a mind sublime. By him attracted, by the powerful love I bear my country, ever held asunder, Pity, and horror, struggling in my bosom, And tearing every nerve; I wish that death For him prepared, was now to fall on me. Nay more, I must confess that I esteem him; Midst all his crimes, his nobleness of heart. Hath won me to him. If the kingly power Could ever be submitted to in Rome, He is the only tyrant we might spare. Be not alarm'd; that name which I detest, That name prevails, and every other tye Is vanquish'd, and destroy'd. The senate, Rome, And you brave sons of liberty, possess My honour, duty, and fidelity Inviolate, entire. I hear the voice Of millions, and the world itself exclaim Against a king. The general good requires This sacrifice. With horror I embrace The sternest form of virtue; you behold me Shudder before you, but my faith is yours Irrevocably fixt.âI go to meet CÃ¦sar once more. Oh! could the lot be mine To soften, change his thoughts, preserve the state, Preserve my father! May the immortal gods Speak by my lips their own pure sentiments! And strong, persuasive eloquence inspire, To pierce, t'affect his heart! But if ambition Blinds him, and renders all my efforts vain, Then lift your arms o'er his devoted head! Strike! I shall turn my eyes a different way. I will not prove a traitor to my country To save a father.âBe my rigid firmness Prais'd or condemn'd; let this unheard of act, Dazzling the world by it's excess of greatness, Be look'd on as an object of it's horror, Or admiration; with a soul endu'd, Not anxious in it's memory to survive, Reproach or glory are indifferent to me. But ever independent, and a Roman, My duty only claims my care,âall else Is less than nothing.âHence then,âand resolve Breaking the yoke of slavery, to be free. CASSIUS. Thy sacred word is given, on that depends The safety of the state, to thee our hopes Are all intrusted, and we listen to thee With that attention Cato would demand, Or Rome herself, or our protecting gods. SCENE III. BRUTUS Alone. This is the time by CÃ¦sar fixt, to meet, And once more to confer with me.âThere stands The capitol, where death awaits his footsteps. Eternal gods! Oh! from my soul remove This cloud of horror! Let me not behold him With detestation! Gracious powers! restrain The vengeful arms, uplifted on his head To fall with direst punishment; inspire His ample soul (if that may be) with thoughts More tender, more affectionate to Rome And its true interests! Cause him to be just! And then to my embraces give a father! But see, he comes! I stand immoveableâ And rooted in astonishment!âSupport, Spirit of Cato! now support my virtue! SCENE IV. CÃSAR, BRUTUS. CÃSAR. What Brutus, is the purport of this meeting? Is thy heart human? Art thou CÃ¦sar's son? BRUTUS. I am, if CÃ¦sar be the son of Rome. CÃSAR. Ungenerous and ill-taught republican, What is thy aim? Was I desired to meet thee, That thou might'st heap fresh insults on my head? Say, cannot all my favours shower'd upon thee, A subject world awaiting thy controul, The glorious prospect of imperial sway, My never wearied kindness, move thy heart?â With what sensations dost thou view the crown? BRUTUS. With horror. CÃSAR. I lament, and can excuse Thy prejudices, but art thou resolv'd Ever to hate me? BRUTUS. No, I love thee CÃ¦sar; Thy noble deeds, long e'er thou had'st disclosed The secret of my birth, inclined my soul To reverence thee; I mourn'd, sincerely mourn'd In secret to the gods, when I beheld A man of such illustrious qualities, At once the glory, and the scourge of Rome. I cannot think of CÃ¦sar as a king Without abhorrence,âwould he condescend To be a citizen, I would adore him As some divinity; my life, my fortunes, And every earthly good would I devote A grateful sacrifice. CÃSAR. On what in me is this abhorrence founded? BRUTUS. Upon thy tyranny. Oh! deign to hear The sighs, the prayers, the counsels, of each true, Each worthy Roman, with the senate's join'd, Join'd with thy son's! Wouldst thou o'er all mankind Possess the due priority of rank, Enjoy th'undoubted honour, by a right More sacred than the power of war can give; Would'st be far superior to a king, Superior e'en to CÃ¦sarâ CÃSAR. Whither tends?â BRUTUS. Thou seest the world in chains, enslaved, and bound To thy triumphal car;âbreak all our fetters! Restore us all to freedom!âbe a Roman! And cast away the diadem with scorn! CÃSAR. Ah! what hast thou advised? BRUTUS. To do no more Than Sylla had the greatness to perform. Long unopposed, he welter'd in our blood; But when he granted Rome her liberty All was forgotten; having laid aside The power supreme, that action wash'd away Each foul and sanguine stain: his barbarous rage Soils not thy heart, dare to possess his virtues. Thou canst humanely pardon an offender, Oh CÃ¦sar! let thy noble soul do more. May not the kindness which thou shew'st, hereafter Be from the treasures of remembrance taken, And gratefully bestow'd again on thee? Rome then intreats thee, the collected state Implores thy clemency, their faults forgive, And spare the worst of punishments, a king! So, what we could not yield to rank or station, Our hearts shall in submission bend before thee, Then shalt thou truly reign, then shalt thou find The zealous warmth of love, and all the duty Of a fond son in Brutus.âHah! that brow In frowns contracted! And hast thou decreed That I shall plead in vain? CÃSAR. Rome wants a master, As one day, thou perhaps may'st dearly prove, Our citizens are now more great than kings. When manners change, a necessary change Of laws ensues. The freedom which we claim, Is but a dangerous right to hurt ourselves; And all-destroying Rome is now mature For self-destruction. Dreadful to the world, The huge Colossus trampled on their realms; By the too-wide, ambitious, ill-judg'd stretch, Its giant frame is shaken to its base, It nods, and 'gainst the desolating fall Demands my succouring arm. In short, the time Of Sylla was the period when we saw Our antient virtues, all that boasted erst The glorious, and peculiar term of Roman, Our equal laws, the common-weal, destroy'd; Since which they have been mere superfluous names. In our corrupted Ãra, when the state Hath been so long the prey of civil wars, Harrast and torn, thy language would persuade us That now the Decii and Emilii flourish'd, With justice, independence, honour, fame. Oh, my lov'd son! thou ow'st these sentiments, Generous indeed, but which mislead thy heart, To Cato's erring notions; I foresee Thy virtue, brooding o'er them, will subject The state to ruin, while perhaps thyself Shalt with it perish.âGive thy reason scope! Oh, follow its free guidance! let it heed If possible, in some degree, the words Of him, who vanquished Cato, and debell'd The arrogance of Pompey! heed a father, Who loves thee, who with real grief beholds The wand'rings of thy fancy! be indeed My son! Oh Brutus, to my prayers afford A portion of thy heart! let other thoughts Find entrance there! I beg, nay I conjure thee, By all the truest ardour of affection! Lay not that task upon thy soul, that task Most difficult to stifle, to subdue Nature, and all its tender impulses! Dost thou not answer me? Dost thou avert From me thy eyes? BRUTUS. He tears me from myself,â I am no longer Brutus;âstrike ye gods! Here aim your thunder!âCÃ¦sarâ CÃSAR. Speak at once,â Say thou art touch'd, that thy breast feels within The soft emotions rising into life. Oh, tell me! speak my son.â BRUTUS. Dost thou behold The toils of death encompass thee around? That thou art doom'd its speedy prey? Behold'st thou Each true-born Roman in the senate, glowing With secret warmth, and ready in thy heart To plunge the mortal steel? Oh! e'er that time Arrives, obey the strongest arguments, Rome's safety, and thy own, let them prevail! By me, alarm'd, thy better genius speaks, He urges, he impells me, sinks me thus Upon my knees before thee.âCÃ¦sar hear! By our protecting and avenging gods, Long disregarded! by thy many virtues! By the once aweful dignity of Rome! Nay, by thyself, and, if I may proceed, By all the filial terrors which I now With pangs sustain! By all the filial love Awaken'd in a breast which thee prefers To all mankind, and only Rome to thee! Let me not suffer a repulse! CÃSAR. Oh! still A slave to thy unhappy prejudice, Leave me! to what a lowly ebb wouldst thou Reduce the state of CÃ¦sar? BRUTUS. Be persuaded,â Why art thou thus obdurate? CÃSAR. Tho' the world, And nature's self should change,âthis fixed soul Shall ne'er be moved. BRUTUS. Is this thy final answer? CÃSAR. It is, th'unalterable plan is form'd. When CÃ¦sar wills, Rome must, and ought t'obey. BRUTUS. Farewell then all my hopes!âFarewell to thee! CÃSAR. Hah! Say, what thoughts thus die thy cheeks with pale? Stay, stay awhile my son!âHeaven, whence these tears! Alas! can Brutus weep? Is it because A king, and regal power will be establish'd? Doth he lament the fate of Rome? BRUTUS. I weep For thee alone,âonce more farewell! farewell! CÃSAR. O, spirit worthy antient Rome! Oh virtue! And fortitude heroic! why with him Can I not mingle sentiments? And love, With such enthusiastic warmth, my country? SCENE V. CÃSAR, DOLABELLA, ROMANS. DOLABELLA. Th'assembled senate, as was thy command, Are met i'th temple of the capitol. For thee alone they wait, I saw the throne Erected. All whose lives and suffrages Are thine by right of purchase throng around Thy statues, and with lavish praises pour Due homage there. The Roman citizens, The multitude are all prepared to come With me their leader, and no doubt the senate Will fix their wavering minds.âBut might I give Advice to CÃ¦sar, would he hear an old And faithful soldier, bound by every tye To prosecute his interests, would he heed Those dreadful omens, which with terror fill The bosoms of his friends, and join'd to these The warning sooth-sayers, nay Heaven itself, The interfering gods, he would defer His great attempt to more auspicious times. CÃSAR. Hah! when the crown is placed within my reach, Can'st thou advise me to defer a moment? Say, who on earth can frustate my designs? DOLABELLA. All nature seems with one consent to join, And with unprosperous augury forbid thee To urge thy purpose farther, why? Unless Heaven, that to monarchs gives their diadem, Is fearful of thy death! CÃSAR. What then is CÃ¦sar? I boast not aught beyond the state of man. Can I believe that Heaven would e'er disturb Its peace for me? And with prophetic voice Bid mute and senseless nature to foretell My hidden fate? That all the elements Would in confusion rise, to add a day, A little day, to the short transient life Of one poor mortal?âBy th'eternal gods In their exalted sphere our days are numbered; Let us, without retreat or dread, pursue Where leads their strong, unerring destiny. CÃ¦sar hath nought to fear. DOLABELLA. But he hath foes, Who with reluctance this new yoke survey, Nor will with ease be tam'd into subjection. Who knows what desperate steps revenge may take! How in their rage they may conspire against thee! CÃSAR. They will not, dare not. DOLABELLA. Thou hast arm'd thy heart With too much confidence. CÃSAR. What should I gain By using poor precautions to ward off The fatal period? Merited contempt. E'en these precautions too might fail to guard me. DOLABELLA. CÃ¦sar should be more careful of a life On which the safety of all Rome depends. At least permit me, (this may well be granted) T'attend thee to the senate. CÃSAR. No; why alter Our preconcerted plan? The time we fix'd Let us by no means hurry on so rashly. The man who deviates from his first resolve, Well-founded, shews his weakness by the change. DOLABELLA. I leave thee with regret.âMy conscious heart Owns, that it beats with strong-imagin'd fears; Those new emotions overcome its firmness. CÃSAR. No more; much rather would I die at once, Than be afraid of death. Let us away! SCENE VI. DOLABELLA, ROMANS. O friends! O citizens! what mighty hero, Whose deeds in arms, whose never-yielding spirit, What conquests, from th'extensive world, and you Could more applause, or more of homage claim? You, who confess his virtues, who admire His glorious actions, join your wills with mine! Confirm those honours destin'd to reward Him whom you ever lov'd!âMay we exist But for his service, and with ardour shed Our blood in his defence!âWhat clamours, Heaven! What dreadful sounds are these! The Conspirators behind the Scenes. Die tyrant, die, Courage, strike, Cassius. DOLABELLA. Let us fly to save him. SCENE VII. CASSIUS, a dagger in his hand, DOLABELLA, ROMANS. CASSIUS. The deed is done, the tyrant is no more. DOLABELLA. Now, now assist me Romans! rush upon him! And pierce the traitor with a thousand wounds! CASSIUS. Strive, strive my countrymen, to imitate What this right hand hath gloriously perform'd! You are no longer subject to a master. Nation of heroes! conquerors of the world! Hail the return of liberty! this hand Hath broke her fetters. DOLABELLA. Will you then betray The cause of him you loved, my countrymen? In worth transcendent, in renown unrivall'd, Shall his illustrious blood flow unrevenged? CASSIUS. For you, for Rome, I have not spared from death My dearest friend.âWhose blood is spilt, but his Who would have fasten'd on you servile bonds? Say, is there one among you all that hear me So low in virtue, of a soul so tame, A spirit so infirm, as to regret CÃ¦sar and slavery? Is there here a Roman So vile, so base as to desire a king? If there be one,âspeak,âload me with reproaches. I see instead, joy spread o'er every face. You could not but applaud the righteous deed, For all of you were born the heirs of fame, Lovers of glory, and heroic virtue. ROMANS. He was a tyrant,âmay his memory perish! Perish the name of CÃ¦sar! CASSIUS. You, who now Can call the world your own!âOffspring of Rome! Who now your long-lost happiness may boast! Preserve for ever in your noble hearts These glowing sentiments!âBut let me warn you Against surprize; I know that Anthony Means to appear before you; recollect That CÃ¦sar was his master, that he served Beneath him even from his tender years, Instructed in that school iniquitous, In each tyrannic art.âHe will attempt To justify his lord, his views ambitious, And thirst of government.âBut much of you Will he misdeem, if he supposes aught Of subtle rhetoric from his lips pronounced, Will turn your souls aside.âHere must he speak; It is his right; such are the laws of Rome; These laws are sacred, nor shall Cassius ever Fail to obey them. But meantime, forget not That the collective body of the people Have now supreme authority, the judges Of CÃ¦sar, Anthony, and of myself. Again you enter on your legal rights, By violence, and fraud, unworthily So long denied. By CÃ¦sar ravisht from you, Take them again from me, not shorn of strength, But firmer, more establish'd. Now I seek The capitol, there Brutus with the senate In council sits, me he expects, the time Demands immediate haste.âWith him combined, Again within this seat of anarchy, Justice shall walk revered; our exiled gods Return propitious; this, our grateful task; Nor shall we fail to stifle the remains Of factious rage, to crush the latent plots Of desperate villany, and raise once more The beauteous pile of freedom from its ruins. Only do you, my much-loved countrymen, With willing hearts consent to be restored To every privilege, and render'd happy; Do not betray yourselves, I ask no more. Dread Anthony's designs, but chief beware Lest he should circumvent you by his wiles, And nice display of art. ROMANS. Let him presume To speak a word 'gainst Cassius, and he dies. CASSIUS. These words be as a sacred bond betwixt us! Imprint them, gentle Romans, on your minds; Remember them and me. ROMANS. Our hearts are fixed, Ne'er to forget th'avengers of their country. SCENE VIII. ANTHONY, ROMANS, DOLABELLA. FIRST ROMAN. But see, Mark Anthony! SECOND ROMAN. What, I admire, Can he dare offer? THIRD ROMAN. How he weeps! His soul Is much afflicted.âHark! he groans. FOURTH ROMAN. Most dearly He loved the death-doom'd CÃ¦sar. ANTHONY, from the rostrum. I confess it. My heart was link'd to his; with joy unfeign'd To shield him from the stroke; I would have bared This bosom to the fury of his foes. Alas! the time hath been, when you too joined Your love with mine, and when you shall reflect, That casting from his brow the proffered crown, In veneration of our sacred laws, He yet this day hath fallen a bleeding victim, Which of you can refuse to praise the hero? Who would not even for his sake have died? But ah! I mean not with my feeble voice T'exalt his memory; that, throughout the world, By glory borne, fills the loud trump of fame. I only ask you, with an eye of pity, To view my poignant anguish, or at least To gain your pardon for the tears of friendship. FIRST ROMAN. Then should thy tears have flow'd, when Rome was forced To crouch beneath a master. What avails it, That we acknowledge CÃ¦sar was an hero? He was a traitor likewise to his country. SECOND ROMAN. He was a tyrant.âHe possest of virtue! Impossible. THIRD ROMAN. Impossible. We all approve the deed Of Cassius, and of Brutus. ANTHONY. I am silent,â Nor urge I aught against the men who slew him; No doubt, their noble hearts aspired to serve The general weal. For this they pierced the breast Of your dictator; loaded with his kindness, For this, their hands impurpled in his blood.â To force the souls of Romans to an act So horrid in its nature, CÃ¦sar's crimes Were surely equal to the vengeance taken, Nor otherwise do I believe.âYet tell me, Tell me sincerely, did you ever feel, My countrymen, the weight of CÃ¦sar's power Imposed upon you? Did he, for himself, For his own use, hoard up the costly fruits Of his extended conquests? For your brows, The spoils of the wide world were hither brought, A wreath (as 'twere) to crown them. All the wealth Of all the nations which his power o'ercame, By his toils purchased, by his many wounds, On you, profusely generous he bestow'd. Did he not watch from his exalted car Your clouded aspects? Would he not descend? Search out your hidden griefs, and wipe away Each starting tear?âHe brought the universe Under subjection, but to you resign'd The triumph; you enjoy'd it at your ease, In the full pleasure of domestic quiet. His courage made you great, his benefits Render'd you happy; did he e'er neglect, If but well-meant, to gratify a service? Was there any injury he could not pardon?â Immortal gods! bear witness! you whose image He was on earth! bear witness mighty gods! Who to his sway resign'd this nether sphere, That the prime object of his soul was mercy. ROMANS. True, for his bounty, and his clemency, CÃ¦sar was always loved. ANTHONY. Alas! my friends! Could his superior soul have e'er admitted But an idea of revenge, his life Had been secure, and by that sacred life, Our wishes in their utmost latitude Had been accomplish'd. He, instead, shower'd thick Rewards and favours on his murtherers' heads. Twice he preserved the life of Cassius. Brutus,âbut I am lost,âO gracious gods! O unexampled crime! barbarity Beyond expression, or conceit!âMy soul, O my dear countrymen, recoils,âI faint,â A misty darkness shrouds my every sense.â Brutus, that cruel monster,âwas his son. ROMANS. Great gods! ANTHONY. I see, your generous virtue scarce Supports the shock; your lofty spirits shrink Back from the thought,âand now the softening tear, Best proof of sweet humanity, descends. Yes, Brutus was his son,âbut unconfined Was his affection,âYou, who now are present, Who hear me plead his cause, were all his sons, Th'adopted of his heart.âOh! did you know His will! his final testament! ROMANS. Inform us,â What of his will?âSpeak,âsay,â ANTHONY. The Roman people Are his appointed heirs; to you belong His riches, soon to be surrendered up To your possession. Not the tomb itself Bounded your CÃ¦sar's love; you see his mind, For your advantage, busied still beyond it. His heart was ever fix'd on you alone. For you, o'er Asia's hostile fields he plann'd His destined march; for you, resolved to risque His life, his fortune, prodigal of both. O Romans! (I have often heard him thus Exclaim in secret) truly royal race! Whom I delight to serve.âCÃ¦sar may rule The vanquish'd earth, but you shall govern CÃ¦sar. Would Brutus, or would Cassius thus have acted? Or heeded more the interest of their country? ROMANS. We hate them, we detest them,âwe resent The very question. FIRST ROMAN. CÃ¦sar was alone The father of the state. ANTHONY. Th'indulgent father. But never shall our eyes behold again His gracious form.âConfederates vile in ill, Base, infamous assassins, have cut short The measure of his days; by violence Have ravish'd from us, this transcendent man, In every excellence of soul transcendent, The boast, the matchless ornament of nature, The wonder of the world, the pride of Rome. And shall we to our father, to our best Of guardians and protectors, who deserved All our affection, shall we fear to grant him An honourable burial? shall we fail To raise, my gentle friends, his funeral pyre? But lo, they bring him hither!âsee before us His breathless corse! The further Part of the Stage opens. The Lictors bearing the Body of CÃ¦sar covered with a bloody Robe. Anthony descends from the Rostrum, and casts himself on his Knees by the Body. ROMANS. O melancholy sight! ANTHONY. All that remains behold, of him who stood, But now, unequall'd 'mid the sons of Rome, The greatest of mankind! Behold the god Of your idolatry! your strong avenger! Whom e'en his murtherers often have adored With bended knees! In peace your guardian friend! Your tutelary power in dangerous war! Who soon victorious would have brought in chains Persia's dread monarch fasten'd to his car! Thus changed, thus prostrate, say, my friends, is this Your ever-conquering chief? your darling CÃ¦sar? See, gentle Romans! see his numerous wounds! Touch them with reverence! View his hallow'd blood, From its warm veins by perjured ruffians sluiced! There Cimber struck; there in th'heroic man, Cassius and Decimus plunged deep their steel, Here the abandon'd Brutus, Brutus lost To every sense of feeling and of shame, To all that's human, in paternal blood Imbrued his most unnatural hand; while CÃ¦sar, Looking upon him with a tranquil eye, Yet glistening with the beams of mild affection, Forgave him as he fell beneath his sword. He call'd him son; that dear and tender name Was all which CÃ¦sar utter'd at his death: My son! said he, and with that word expired. FIRST ROMAN. Infamous monster! Oh that angry Heaven Had torn him from the earth, his crimes pollute, Before this execrable deed was done! OTHER ROMANS. Gods! how his blood still flows! ANTHONY. It calls aloud For vengeance, from your generous souls expects it, And executive hands. Regard its voice! Rouse all your feelings! from this trance of grief Awake! Prepare for action! Follow me Against his murtherers! E'er we punish them, How vain all other honours we can pay To CÃ¦sar's manes! With the flaming brands Snatch'd from his pile, let us reduce to ashes The dwellings of these proud conspirators! And in their bosoms plunge the sharpen'd steel Of madd'ning indignation!âHaste,âdisplay Your native worth,âhaste, to the just revenge Of crimes most horrible, and sacrifice These victims to his country's guardian god! ROMANS. We all are ready; they shall die.âAway! We follow thee;âwe swear by this his blood, Most amply to revenge his timeless death! Away! haste! fly! ANTHONY, to DOLABELLA. Let us not suffer them To spend their rage in useless deeds, but seize Th'occasion, give no time, and hurry on Their vague and ductile passions;âstir them up To mutiny and war; and thus without Long schemes of art, with zeal and active heat Revenging CÃ¦sar's death, at once succeed him. END OF THE THIRD AND LAST ACT.</field>
