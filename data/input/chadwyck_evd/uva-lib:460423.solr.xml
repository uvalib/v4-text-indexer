      <field name="fulltext">ACHILLES IN SCYROS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Lycomedes, King of Scyros. Achilles, in a female dress, under the name of Pyrrha, in love with Deidamia. Deidamia, the Daughter of Lycomedes, in love with Achilles. Ulysses, Ambassador from Greece. Theagenes, Prince of ChalÃ§is, the designed husband of Deidamia. Nearchus, Governor of Achilles. Arcas, the Confident of Ulysses. Chorus of Bacchanals. Chorus of Singers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene in the Island of Scyros.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The outside of a magnificent temple dedicated to Bacchus. Between the pillars of the temple is discovered on one side the wood sacred to the Deity, and on the other side the sea coast of Scyros. The piazza is filled with Bacchanals celebrating the festival of the God, to the sound of various instruments. A numerous company of the noble dames of Scyros descending the steps from the temple: with these are seen Deidamia and Achilles, the last in a female habit. Chorus of Bacchanals. While each, O father Bacchus! pays To thee this hymn of grateful praise, Descend our raptur'd souls to raise With thy celestial fire. Part Chorus. O! source! from whom our blessings flow, Oblivion sweet of human woe! By thee we scorn this life below, And to the skies aspire. Chorus. Descend our raptur'd souls to raise With thy celestial fire. Part Chorus. By thee, the blood, that scarce maintains A sluggish course through freezing veins, With warmth renew'd fresh vigour gains, And glows with young desire. Chorus. Descend our raptur'd souls to raise With thy celestial fire. Part Chorus. Henceforth deceit shall fly the breast That owns thee for its chosen guest, And lips, before with falsehood drest, The words of truth acquire. Chorus. Descend our raptur'd souls to raise With thy celestial fire. Part Chorus. Thou mak'st the coward Fame revere; Thou dry'st from weeping eyes the tear; Thou bid'st the blush of modest fear From lovers' cheeks retire. Chorus. O! source! from whom our blessings flow; Oblivion sweet of human woe! By thee we scorn this life below, And to the skies aspire. [here the Chorus is interrupted by the sound of trumpets from the sea. Deid. [to Ach.] Didst thou not hear? Ach. Princess, I did. Deid. Who dares With sounds profane thus rashly to disturb The sacred rites of our mysterious orgies? Ach. 'Tis so; I am not deceiv'd; from yonder seas The sounding clangour comes, and yet I know not, Nor can divine the causeâbut now methinks I see two vessels, with extended sails, Swift making to the shore. [two ships appear at a distance. Deid. [alarmed.] Ah, me! Ach. What fear'st thou? As yet they're distant far. Deid. O! let us fly. [all fly but Ach. and Deid. Ach. And wherefore fly? Deid. Hast thou not heard these seas Are fill'd with impious pirates? Thus were borne The wretched daughters from their mourning sires, The kings of Tyre and ArgosâKnow'st thou not The recent loss which Sparta has sustain'd? That Greece indignant claims, but claims in vain The faithless consort from her Trojan spoiler? Who knows but these deceitful vessels now Again may bringâO! Heaven! I sink with terror! Ach. Fear not, my love, is not Achilles here? Deid. O! holdâ Ach. And if Achillesâ Deid. O! forbear; Some one may hear thee: should'st thou be discover'd, I am lost myself, and thou to me art lost. What will my father say, deluded thus? Thou know'st he thinks in thee he views a maid, And oft, with smiles, has witness'd to our loves. But what must chance, (I tremble at the thought) Should he e'er learn that, veil'd in Pyrrha's name, I love Achilles? Ach. Pardon, Deidamia, I own your caution just. SCENE II. Enter Nearchus. Near. [entering.] Behold the lovers. And must I ever tremble for your sake? [to them.] Imprudent pair! a thousand times I've warn'd you, But warn'd in vain. All eyes observe how still You shun society, and court the shades. Your conduct is the theme of every tongue. Goâseek the king; the palace now is throng'd, And only you are absent. Ach. [not attending.] Sure that sound From yonder ships bespeaks them freighted deep With arms and warriors. Deid. [aside to Near.] Heavens! what martial spirit Flames in his looks! Each art must be employ'd To draw him hence. Near. [to both.] And still you linger here. Ach. This instant I'll depart: but let me, princess, Behold those vessels enter first the port. Deid. What! shall I leave you thus beset with perils? But this thou heed'st notâO! I see too well Thou lov'st not Deidamia: from thy heart know thou judgest mine, too cruel man! Ach. Then let us go: appease thy gentle spirit, A look of thine subdues me. Deid. No, ingrate! Thou but deceiv'st me, thou art falsehood all. Ah! no, ingrate! thou know'st not love, Or if thou feel'st his dart, Thou ne'er for me the cares wilt prove That rend a gentle heart. Love at thy choiceâthy wayward will Can raise, or quench the flame; Nor heed that truth which lovers still From faithful lovers claim. [Exit. Achilles follows her, then stops at the entrance, and turns again to observe the ships, which are now so near, that on the deck of one of them is distinguished a warrior completely armed. SCENE III. Nearchus, Achilles. Near. The olive branch that decks those gliding prows Proclaims them friendly vessels. Ach. See, Nearchus, Observe that warrior clad in shining arms, Of port majestick. Near. âHence: it ill befits That thou, a seeming virgin, wrapt in weeds Of female softness, still should'st linger here Alone, without defence. Ach. But say, Nearchus, Am I not deem'd thy own? Does not the voice Of general fame declare thee for my father? What wonder then a daughter should converse With him who gave her birth? Near. But well thou know'st Thy stay offends the princess. Ach. True, Nearchus. [looking towards the ships. Near. [aside.] How hard to keep Achilles long conceal'd! Ach. O! did yon splendid helmet deck my brows, Yon falchion grace my sideâno more, Nearchus, I'm weary of disguiseâthis sex's weeds Of sloth ingloriousâtime demandsâ Near. What time? O! Heaven! remember that this sex's weeds Have won and still preserv'd the fair-one thine. Ach. 'Tis true, but yetâ Near. Depart. Ach. O! let me now But for a moment view those dazzling arms, And kindle at the sight. Near. [aside.] What course remains? [to Ach.] Yes, stay; indulge thy wish, but know meantime Thy rival dwells on Deidamia's charms. Ach. What say'st thou, ha! Near. The prince of Chalcis comes To Scyros' court, and Lycomedes wills With him to join his daughter's hand. Ach. O! Heavens! Near. 'Tis true, her heart is thine; but should thy rival Assail her youth with all the arts of flattery, Alone and unobserv'dâwho knows, Achilles, He may, perchance, prevail and win her from thee. Ach. What mortal dares my wrath excite, Or hope to win my soul's delight, While still to guard a lover's right, I breathe this vital air? What though the power of beauty's eyes Has cloth'd these limbs in soft disguise, My breast a hero's warmth supplies, I feel Achilles there. [Exit. SCENE IV. Nearchus alone. Great is the task that Thetis has enjoin'd: I fear each moment may reveal Achilles. Tis true the force of potent love restrains His native warmth; but when perchance he hears The trumpet's sound, or sees a warrior clad In plate and mail, his genius takes the alarm: He raves aloud and scorns his feeble dress Of powerless woman. Should he learn that Troy Can never fall without his fateful arm; That now all Greece combin'd require his aid, What were his feelings then? Forbid it, Heaven, That any Greek should seek him on this shoreâ [looking out.] O! Gods! am I deceiv'd? Is that Ulysses? What cause has brought him hither? Not by chance, He seeks the port of ScyrosâWhat were best? He knew me once, and knew me at the court Of aged Peleus, young Achilles' sire. 'Tis true, since then a length of years has pass'd. At all events I would remain conceal'd, Nor own myself the same he saw in Greece. âHo! stranger! pass no further; first declare Thy name and lineage: such is here the law, And such my sovereign's will. SCENE V. Enter Ulysses. Ulys. The law be reverenc'd: Behold Ulysses here. Near. Ulysses, Heavens! Forgive, O! generous chief, my hasty speech: I fly to tell the king these welcome tidings. [going. Ulys. Yet one word more: art thou not here a servant Of royal Lycomedes? Near. Rightly spoken, I am his servant. Ulys. And thy name? Near. Nearchus. Ulys. What country claims thy birth? Near. The town of Corinth. Ulys. Why didst thou quit, for this, thy native land? Near. I cameâO! Heavens!âI tarry here too long; Forgive me, sir, the king meantime impatient, Knows not as yet what ships have reach'd the port. Ulys. Go then, my friend, dispatch. Near. [aside.] How well I feign'd! Yet scarcely could escape his wise detection. [Exit. SCENE VI. Enter Arcas. Ulys. Heaven favours, Arcas, now our great design. Arc. Whence springs this hope? Ulys. Didst thou not hear our converse? Thou saw'st who parted from me: know I met him At Peleus' court, now many years elaps'd. With me feign'd his country and his name: But when I question'd him he seem'd confus'd. Noâfame has not deceiv'd us: here disguis'd In female garb, Achilles lives conceal'd. Fly, Arcas, and pursue his steps, who late Amus'd my ear with falsehood: seek to know His real state; why settled here, and where He now residesâby whom accompanied; The slightest hint may guide us. Arc. I am gone. [going. Ulys. Yet hear, take heed that not the least surmise Be given to make it thought we seek Achilles. Arc. Such caution to a follower of Ulysses Were surely needless. [Exit. SCENE VII. Ulysses alone. With a prosperous wind Thus far our vessel sails. To some, perchance, This well-tim'd meeting, this confus'd discourse, Those troubled looks were little; but to those Who like Ulysses judge they promise much. A slender gleam in dreary night Can guide the skilful pilot right, Till soon he finds the polar light, And safely ploughs the watry way. Full oft a single track has sped The pilgrim lost, and surely led No more fallacious paths to tread, That lure the heedless feet astray. [Exit. SCENE VIII. The apartment of Deidamia. Lycomedes, Deidamia. Lyc. But if thou see'st him not, then wherefore think The prince must prove ungracious in thine eyes? Deid. Already have I heard and much, my lord, Of prince Theagenes. Lyc. And wilt thou judge By others' eyes? O! rash and unadvis'd! Go to the royal garden, there expect me, I'll join thee soon, and with me thither bring Thy plighted spouse. Deid. My plighted spouse? Lyc. He comes Relying on my faith: all is prepar'd. Deid. At least, my lord, my father! hearâ Lyc. No more: The ambassador from Greece expects an audience. No more oppose my will: embrace the counsel A king and father gives. Deid. Then, dear my lord, You counsel, not command me. Lyc. When a father Gives to a daughter counsel, he commands. To inexperienc'd minds that know Few fickle turns of human woe, The advice that faithful lips bestow Will oft like harsh decrees offend, Confounding rashly praise and blame, Who mildly rules, they tyrant name, And cruel him, who proves a friend. [Exit. SCENE IX. Enter Achilles. Deid. And shall I break my faith to him I love! Noâere another spouseâ Ach. [entering.] And may I then Presume to intrude on Deidamia's presence? I would not come unwish'd forâha! alone! Where is thy plighted lord? I hop'd to find The prince of Chalcis breathing ardent vows At Deidamia's feet. Deid. And have you heardâ Ach. All, all is known; but not from theeâO proof! O wondrous proof of thy unsullied faith! From me, inhuman, hast thou well conceal'd This treason to my hopesâfrom me who lov'd thee Far more than life; from me, who thus inglorious, In these vile weeds dishonour'd for thy sakeâ âFalse Deidamia! Deid. O! eternal Powers! Reproach me not; believe me, till this day I never heard of these detested nuptials: But now my father urg'd the fatal union; Trembling I stood, and senseless at the shock, Felt all my blood congeal'd within my veins. Ach. What canst thou now resolve? Deid. To hazard all, But never to forsake thee. Prayers and tears Shall be employ'd to soften Lycomedes: Sure he will yield, if nature's voice can bend A father's heart to save a darling child: And should he still pursue his cruel purpose, O! never, never must he hope to shake My constant faith. Achilles was the first, The first dear object of my virgin heart, And my last dying breath shall sigh Achilles. Yes, thou may'st see me dead, but never see Thy love betray'd by Deidamia's change. Ach. Transporting sounds! How, how shall I repay Such unexampled goodness? Deid. Grant but this: Preserve, if possible, with greater heed, Our secret from discovery. Ach. What are else These woman's vestures? Deid. But can these avail, If every action, every look belies them? Thy free and manly step but ill beseems The timorous maid; thine eyes too boldly dart Their wandering glances: every little cause Excites thy temper's warmth, nor seems thy anger Such anger as a female bosom breeds. If but a helm or javelin meet thy sight, Or let them but be nam'd, thy look is chang'd, Thy glaring eye-balls flash with living fire, Pyrrha is lost, and all proclaims Achilles. Ach. Hard is the task for nature to reverse Her first designs. Deid. And sure as hard the task To oppose a father's will. With such a plea May Deidamia wed the prince of Chalcis? Ach. O! never, never! I submitâO! pardonâ Whate'er thou bidd'st Achilles shall obey. Deid. But now you promis'd, yetâ Ach. O! noâthis once I yield to thee: I'll rein my struggling passions, Nor speak again of war: if I forget Thy bidding more, to punish my neglect Fly to my rival's arms, and I forgive thee. Deid. Be silentâhark! some stranger is at hand To catch the unguarded sound. SCENE X. Enter Ulysses. Ach. [meeting Ulys.] And who art thou That rashly hast presum'd to invade these seats Of sacred privacy? What wouldst thou? Speak. Speak, or this insolenceâ Deid. Pyrrha! forbear. Ulys. [aside.] What stern demeanour in a female form! Deid. [aside to Ach.] Didst thou not promiseâ Ach. [to her.] True, my Deidamia: I stand reprov'd. Ulys. Say, are not these the apartments Of royal Lycomedes? Deid. Lycomedes Resides not here. Ulys. If I, a stranger, err'd, Forgive the intrusion. [going. Deid. Yet vouchsafe a word: What seek'st thou with the king? Ulys. From him the Greeks Request a warlike aid of ships and men, All Greece assembling with confederate arms To avenge the general wrong. Ach. [aside.] How happy those Who quit the dwellings of enfeebling sloth To join this host of heroes! Deid. [aside.] See! already His placid features change. Ulys. Behold a path Is open'd now to every daring mind That pants for valiant deeds: the vilest breast Must catch the kindling sparks. Ach. [aside.] And yet Achilles Still loiters here! Deid. [aside.] Such converse must not be: I tremble at the dangerâ[to Ulys.] Yonder way Will lead thy steps to Lycomedes' presence. Stranger, farewellâCome, Pyrrha, let us hence. [going. Ach. [returning.] Say, friend, what port receives the Grecian fleet United for this glorious enterprize? Deid. [to Ach.] Why, Pyrrha, this delay? Ach. Behold I followâ O! tyrant, tyrant love! [Exit with Deid. SCENE XI. Ulysses alone. Or fond desire To find this youth presents in every place His imag'd form, or Pyrrha is Achilles. I well remember such were Peleus' features In manhood's ripening yearsâthat speech, those looksâ It must be soâbut yet Ulysses' caution Will not too soon confide: who knows? Appearance May still deceive me. Should this prove Achilles, I will be wary ere I speak: the time, The place, each circumstance must all be weigh'd. That pilot rarely ploughs the waves with safety, Who sounds not first the depth. We yet must pause Till all is ripe before we strike the blow, Then make it sure. SCENE XII. Enter Arcas. Arc. Ulysses. Ulys. Arcas here? How hast thou found admittance in these walls? Arc. I saw you enter, and pursu'd your steps. Ulys. What hast thou learn'd meantime that may import Our great design? Arc. But little, good my lord; That to this land since first Nearchus came, A year is now complete: with him he brings His only daughter, grac'd above her sex With more than female gifts: for her the princess, The royal Deidamia, bears a love, A wondrous love, beyond a woman's friendship. Ulys. How dost thou name this virgin? Arc. Pyrrha. Ulys. Pyrrha? Arc. And for her sake Nearchus holds a place Among the royal train of Scyros' court. Ulys. And think'st thou this is little thou hast learn'd? Arc. Why what imports it? Ulys. O! my trusty friend, In one short moment we have travell'd far. Hear me, and then confess. SCENE XIII. Enter Nearchus. Near. My lord, delay not; Even now the king expects you. Ulys. Say, which way Leads to the royal presence? Near. Yonder passage Conducts us to him. Ulys. Lead, I follow thee. [aside to Arc.] Some other time shall tell thee. [Exit with Near. SCENE XIV. Arcas alone. Like Ulysses What man can pierce the veil of human deeds? What seems to others dark, to him is light As Sol's meridian beam: nor art, nor nature E'er form'd his equal. Where is he, who knows Like him to mould his looks to every passion, Yet keep his heart a stranger to them all? Who can, like him, with soft persuasive speech Enchain the yielding soul? With every moment Can change his genius, language, form, and likeness? Such have I never known; still, day by day I watch Ulysses, ever at his side, And every day I find Ulysses new. When summer showers refresh the plain, And skies a changing aspect show; When Sol returning shines again; Thus Iris dyes her various bow. The glossy dove, in open light, Thus shews her many-colour'd plumes; And when she spreads her wings for flight, A thousand different hues assumes. [Exit. SCENE XV. The gardens belonging to the palace. Achilles, Deidamia. Deid. Achilles, no; I can no longer trust Thy oft-forgotten promise; should'st thou stay, I know, in presence of Theagenes, Thy rage would know no bounds: thy look, thy speech Might soon discover all. If yet thou lov'st me, Leave me, in pity leave me. Ach. Yet permit me, Retir'd apart, in silence to behold The rival of my love. Deid. O! Heavens, I tremble To think what danger waits theeâbut he comes. Ach. [looking out.] Is that the man whose rashness has presum'd! And shall I tamely bearâ Deid. Is this thy faith? Already thou forget'stâ Ach. A hasty impulseâ No more, my loveâ'tis past, and I am calm. Deid. Again thy warmth will speak. Ach. O! no, by Heaven! Forgive me, Deidamia. [he retires to the back of the stage. SCENE XVI. Enter Lycomedes with Theagenes; Achilles behind. Lyc. Dearest daughter, Behold thy husband; thou, Theagenes, Illustrious prince, behold thy destin'd spouse. Ach. [behind.] Still, still, my soul, repress thy swelling rage. Theag. Whoe'er, O princess, hears what Fame relates Of Deidamia's charms, may deem she flatters; But when he sees you thus, will think her tongue Has paid but scanty praise. Lo! I subdu'd, Your happy prisoner, yield my freedom here, And give my life in dowery with my love. Ach. [aside.] Unheard of insolence! [looking disdainfully at Theag. advancing nearer. Deid. [to Theag.] My merits, prince, Have ne'er aspir'd so high; nor should you now So far extol them. [sees Ach. near Theag. Pyrrha! hence! what mean'st thou? Ach. I speak not, princess. [retires again. Deid. [aside.] O! what terror shakes My every sense! Theag. [to Lyc. observing Ach.] What virgin-fair is that Of lofty mien? Lyc. That virgin is your rival. Deid. [aside.] I sink with apprehension. Ach. [aside.] Ah! too surely He pierces my disguise. Lyc. [to Theag.] Her name is Pyrrha, Sole partner now of Deidamia's love; Nor yet the world, from east to western Ind, E'er saw so constant, or so fond a pair. Deid. [aside.] He speaks in sportive vein, but little thinks How well he paints two faithful lovers' vows. Lyc. What thinks my daughter of the noble consort Her father's care provides? Deid. Alas! my lord, My inexperience knows not yet to prizeâ But if I durstâ Lyc. Thou blushest, Deidamia, I read thy heart, and seek to know no further. The blushes, kindling on thy cheek, Thy virgin-wishes prove: Before thy sire thou canst not speak The tender words of love. 'Twere cruel then my presence here Should but increase thy pain: Farewell, and, freed from every fear, No more thy thoughts restrain. [Exit. SCENE XVII. Deidamia, Theagenes; Achilles behind. Ach. [aside.] O! that I now could free these coward limbs From hated female weeds, the weeds of shame! Theag. Permit me, fairest princess, thus before you To paint the warmth that glows within my breast, To tell you allâ Deid. O! speak no more of Loveâ I must not hearâIn me behold his foe. I hate the boast of love-sick fires, And every plaint of fond desires: The train of lovers I despise, And liberty alone I prize. If all, like me, were thus sincere, The truth would less offend our ear; And falsehood then would rarely prove The bane of those that trust in love. [Exit Deid. Achilles following, stops at the entrance. SCENE XVIII. Theagenes, Achilles. Theag. [to himself.] Almighty powers! Does Deidamia thus Receive my vows? In what have I offended? And wherefore thenâlet me pursue her steps. [going. Ach. [meeting him.] Forbearâsay whither would'st thou go? Theag. I go To Deidamia: let me once again Renew my suit. Ach. [resolutely.] It is not now permitted. Theag. Who shall forbid me? Ach. I. Theag. Dost thou forbid me? Ach. Yes, I forbid thee, prince, and know yet more, That when I speak, I never speak in vain. [going slowly. Theag. [aside.] The nymphs of Scyros sure are wondrous strange: Strange in their speech, in their demeanour strange. And yet there's something in this haughty maid That pleases while she threatensâ[to Ach.] Hear me, fair-one, Declare what causeâ Ach. No moreâlet this suffice. [going. Theag. And can you think your words alone will strike A terror here: that you alone have power To shake the purpose of Theagenes? Ach. [sternly.] Such power is mineâbelieve and tremble. Theag. [aside.] Heavens! That fierceness kindles here a new commotion. [Achilles going meets Deid. at the entrance. Deid. False to my hopes!âAnd art thou yet content To fail in every claim of love and honour? Ach. Alas! 'tis trueâI own my warmth betray'd me. [Deid. leaves him. Theag. Hear, beauteous nymph! I will obey your mandate; But, in return, indulge my sole request: Give me to know what this resentment means, And why on me are bent your angry eyesâ And, ah! that sighâthat lookâyou seem confus'dâ Whence is this change? O! speak.âWhy are you silent? Ach. I strive to speak, but strive in vain, My frozen lips each word deny: 'Tis Love can issuing words restrain, 'Tis Love can words at will supply. That Love who, at his choice, can raise The vile to deeds of high desert: That Love, who in a moment lays Beneath his yoke the firmest heart. [Exit. SCENE XIX. Theagenes alone. Where am I? Sure I dream! In such a face Anger itself can pleaseâperchance she loves me, And hence forbids me to pursue a rival. And can it be? So soon to yield to love; So soon to feel the pangs of jealous passion! Such words of menace from a virgin lip; Such bold deportment from the sex that ever Is bred in timid softness? Wondrous all! I know not how; she pains, and yet she charms me. What eye before has ever seen Such winning fierceness, pleasing pride, That love inspires with haughty mien, And gains the heart by threats defied? To her the sword, the lance resign, And o'er her brows the helmet place; Her form with Pallas' self may shine, For female charms and martial grace. [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An apartment adorned with statues representing the labours of Hercules. Ulysses, Arcas. Arc. All, all, as you have will'd, is now prepar'd. The gifts are ready to present the king: With these I've plac'd a coat of shining mail, And military weapons. To your followers 'Tis given in charge to feign a sudden tumult, With warlike clangors. Tell me now what mean These mysteries unexplain'd? Or what can these Avail our great design? Ulys. To find Achilles Amidst a thousand virgins. Arc. How distinguish The youth disguis'd in vestments of the fair? Ulys. Mark well and thou shalt soon behold him, Arcas, With eager eyes devour the dazzling helm And corselet's plates: but when he hears the din Of clashing arms, and trumpets' brazen sounds, That rouze, with generous notes, the warrior's soul, Then, Arcas, shalt thou see the smother'd flame Burst forth resistless and proclaim Achilles. Arc. Too flattering are your hopes. Ulys. I know Achilles, His warlike genius; from his infant years Arms were his sole delight; and well I know 'Tis vain to oppose the powerful bent of nature, Confirm'd by early habit. Midst the enjoyments Of downy rest, scarce sav'd from stormy seas, The pilot vows to quit the land no more; But when the storm is hush'd he leaves again His downy rest, and ploughs secure the waves. Arc. You sure have other signs that might direct Your present search. Ulys. All other signs are doubtful, But these are certainty. Remember, Arcas, No proof can rank with this, when nature speaks With impulse undisguis'd. Arc. But if Achilles (As thus you deem) for Deidamia feel Such strong affection, grant him now discover'd, What art shall win him from the fair he loves? Ulys. With every caution first secure discovery: Discover'd once, Ulysses undisguis'd Will prove all means to assail his fiery temper; Rouze in his breast the latent flame of honour, And kindle on his cheek the glow of shame. Arc. But how to gain the means of converse with him, Defended thus from all access? Ulys. The occasion May yet be found, and heedful let us watch The wish'd-for time, which, should we fail to find, It must be hasten'dâyes, the trialâ Arc. See Where Pyrrha comes: now seize the momentâ Ulys. Peace: And look she comes alone: myself will seem Intent on other thoughts: meanwhile do thou Observe her every gesture. [they retire behind. SCENE II. Enter Achilles. Ach. [entering.] See the chief Whom Greece has sentâBut that my fair forbids it, How gladly would I join in converse with him. Yet, sure without offence to Deidamia, In silence I may here indulge my eyes To gaze with rapture on his godlike form. Ulys. [aside to Arc.] What now, my Arcas, say? Arc. His looks on thee Are bent with fix'd attention. Ulys. [examining the statues.] In this palace All speaks a kingly soul. This sculptur'd marble Seems warm with life: behold Alcides there Subdues the hydra: see in every feature His martial spirit, while the artist's hand Informs the stone with all a hero's fire. [to Arcas.] Mark if he hears. Arc. [to Ulys.] He dwells upon your words. Ulys. [turning to the statues.] Lo! where he lifts AntÃ¦us from the ground To hurl him headlong down: the artist here Excels himself. O! how the great example Of godlike virtue, nobly thus express'd, Should warm the generous breast! O! would to Heaven That I could boast Alcides' mighty deeds! Transcendent hero! yes, thy name shall last, From age to age, to far-succeeding times! Ach. O! mighty Gods! what tongue shall thus foretel Of lost, despis'd Achilles! Ulys. [to Arc.] Arcas, speak: How seems he now? Arc. He communes with himself, As strongly agitated. Ulys. Mark him still. [turning again to the statues. What do I see? Behold the same Alcides, The terror late of Erymanthus' woods, Disguis'd in female weeds, and plac'd beside His favourite Iole.âHow much he err'd, (Ill-judging sculptor!) to debase his art With sad memorials of a hero's fall! Alcides here, alas! excites our pity, No more Alcides son of thundering Jove. Ach. 'Tis true, 'tis trueâO! my eternal shame! Ulys. [to Arc.] What think'st thou, Arcas, now? Arc. He seems to rave With conscious feelings. Ulys. Let us then accost him. [advancing to Ach. Arc. [to Ulys. aside.] The king's at hand, take heed, lest aught too soon Reveal our chief design. Ulys. [to Arc.] O ill-tim'd meeting! The work was near complete. SCENE III. Enter Lycomedes. Lyc. [entering.] I sought you, Pyrrha, Attend my will. Ulysses, look the sun Declines already to the western waves; Vouchsafe, illustrious guest, with Lycomedes To share the pleasures of the festive board. Ulys. Your will, O mighty king, to me is law. Lyc. At dawning day, Ulysses, shalt thou see The ships and arms the Greeks request from Scyros: Then mark how these exceed thy utmost hopes, And learn from these how Lycomedes honours His brave allies, and how esteems in thee The generous messenger of Greece combin'd. Ulys. The soul of Lycomedes, ever great, Still holds her wonted tenor: yes, from me The Achaian princes, whose confederate powers Now threaten faithless Troy, shall learn the friendship Of royal Lycomedes: generous proofs I bring; these arms and vessels which your care Has nobly furnish'd for the common cause. [aside.] But deeper aims are mine; a mightier aid I mean that Greece shall win from Scyros' shore. When Troy shall learn the glorious aid I bring from Scyros' shore, Even Hector's self will stand dismay'd, And dread the Grecian power. This single aid he more shall fear, Than all that rang'd in arms appear To swell the Grecian host: Than all the fleet's unnumber'd sail That spread their canvas to the gale For Phrygia's distant coast. [Exit. SCENE IV. Lycomedes, Achilles. Lyc. Would'st thou believe it, Pyrrha? Yes, on thee Depends the future peace of Lycomedes. Ach. What mean these words? Lyc. Yes, dearest maid, 'tis thou Canst make at will a grateful monarch happy. Ach. What power is mine? Lyc. My daughter Deidamia, Repugnant to a father's will, rejects The proffer'd union with the prince of Chalcis. Ach. And wherefore this to me? Lyc. Thou rul'st at pleasure Her every thought, and all her heart is thine. Ach. And would you, Lycomedes, ask from meâ Lyc. Yes, teach her to respect a father's choice; Teach her the virtues of a noble husband, And kindle in her breast a flame for him Who merits all her love: so may she meet His fond address with equal fair return, And all a wife's endearments. Ach. [aside.] Yes, to you, To you, ye weeds of shame, I owe this insult. Lyc. What says my Pyrrha? Ach. Think'st thou then with me Such ministry may suit? Ah! Lycomedes, Thou little know'st meâI? Eternal powers! Shall I?âO! seek some better advocate To enforce a father's will. Lyc. What fears my Pyrrha? Perchance she deems Theagenes a lover That merits not the hand of Deidamia? Ach. [aside.] What shall I say? No longer can I bear Such cruel sufferings. Lyc. Tell me, can my daughter E'er find a nobler union? Ach. [aside.] 'Tis too much. [to Lyc.] Hear me, my lordâ SCENE V. Enter Nearchus. Near. [to Lyc.] The banquet is prepar'd, And all, O Lycomedes, wait your presence. Lyc. Then let us hence. [to Ach.] Remember thou hast heard My dearest wish: to thee I trust, my Pyrrha; Then to thy friendship let me owe my peace. Thy words the stubborn maid may move Her last resolves to own: To embrace a father's tender love, Or meet a father's frown. Tell her within this breast I bear The heart of king and sire: Then let her ease a parent's care, Or dread a monarch's ire. [Exit. SCENE VI. Achilles, Nearchus. Ach. No more, Nearchus, no, I'll hear no more Of temper or disguiseâmy soul is fix'd. No longer hope to abuse my yielding nature: Let us depart. Near. And whither? Ach. From these limbs To strip these woman's weedsâShall I, Nearchus, Thus basely pass my life, my prime of years? And must I bear it tamely, while I see My threats despis'd; and to complete my shame, Charged with a haughty lord's imperious mandate? I see, I see by others' great example My own reproach; nor will I feel each moment The conscious blushâ Near. The conscious blushâ Ach. Be silent: I've borne too long thy counsels: different those The sage Thessalian taught: these feet could then Outstrip the winds: this arm, in savage wilds, Would dare the fiercest beast, and stem the tide Of roaring torrents.âNowâdid Chiron now Behold his pupil in these slothful vestures, Where should I hide? How answer, when with looks Of stern reproach he cries: âWhere, where, Achilles, Is now thy sword, with all the warrior's arms? No mark of Chiron's school, save yonder lyre, Debas'd from heroes' praise to strains inglorious.â Near. Enough, Achilles, I contend no longer, But yield to reason's force. Ach. Think'st thou, Nearchus, This life is worthy of me? Near. NoâI own The generous truth: 'tis time to rouze thy soul From drowsy sleep; shake off that base attire, And haste to scenes where honour calls to prove Thy dauntless heart.â'Tis true, that Deidamia, Depriv'd of thee, must taste of peace no more; Nay, grief perchance may waste her gentle frame Till friendly deathâbut pause not thou, Achilles, In glory's course: the triumphs thou shalt gain May well outweigh the life of Deidamia. Ach. The life of Deidamia! think'st thou then Her constancy will not support our parting? Near. Her constancy? Ah! what can that avail A tender maid who mourns her lover lost, The sole dear object of her fondest wishes, Her comfort and her hope? Ach. [aside.] O! Heaven! Near. And know'st thou That if thou steal'st a moment from her sight A thousand fears distract her? All repose Is banish'd from her breast: with eager warmth Of each she meets she seeks her bosom's lord. How thinks Achilles now she brooks his absence? She knows no peace, but tremblingâ Ach. Let us seek The lovely mourner. Near. Art thou then prepar'd To quit the port of Scyros? Ach. No, Nearchus, No, let us now return to Deidamia. What lover, though his harden'd breast A tiger's heart contains, Can leave his dearest maid opprest With love's afflicting pains? The pity now that rends my soul, And all the pangs I prove, Must sure a tiger's rage control, When tigers yield to love. [Exit. SCENE VII. Nearchus alone. O! miracle of all-commanding love! Surpassing our belief! When anger fires His daring soul, Achilles, terrible, Nor art nor force restrains: his fury then Would naked rush through circling fires, and meet Alone a thousand foes: but let him think On Deidamia once, the fierce Achilles Forgets his rage and softens to a woman. The lion stern, whose proud disdain With lordly roar rejects the chain, Whene'er his keeper's voice he hears, At once subdu'd his rage appears; He yields submissive to command, And mildly licks the chastening hand. [Exit. SCENE VIII. A great hall, a table in the middle: above are placed musicians and numerous spectators. Lycomedes, Theagenes, Deidamia and Ulysses seated at the table. Arcas stands by Ulysses, and Achilles by Deidamia. Courtiers, damsels, and pages. Chorus. Far, far be hence! unwelcome here, Intruding thought and jealous fear; Nor let a moment's gloom appear To cloud this happy festive day. While Love inspires and Peace invites, Affection's mild and calm delights, Let Joy, that rules o'er social rites, In every breast exert his sway. Far, far be hence! unwelcome here, Intruding thought and jealous fear; Nor let a moment's gloom appear To cloud this happy festive day. Lyc. Let every goblet now be circled round With Cretan wine. Deid. [to Ach.] Thou know'st, my dearest Pyrrha, Unless thy hand should minister the cup That heavenly nectar to my lips would prove A tasteless beverage. Ach. I obey. Ah! judge From that obedience if your Pyrrha's heart Is true to Deidamia. Theag. [observing them.] Strange effect Of unexampled passion! [aside. Ach. [aside, going to take the cup.] Tyrant love! Lyc. Say, great Ulysses, when your country's fleet Will loose their anchors from the Grecian shores. Ulys. At my return. Theag. Are all the ships assembled? Ulys. There only want the friendly aids from Scyros. Lyc. O! wretched, feeble state of hoary age, That keeps me now from such a glorious sight. Ulys. [aside.] This is the time for trial. [to Lyc.] Mighty king, The thought is worthy thee. What eyes again Shall view such arms, such leaders, such a host Of gallant warriors, countless steeds and vessels, Spears bristled, banners streaming to the wind; All Europe there assembled. Woods and cities Are deserts now: encouraged by their sires, Their reverend sires, who mourn their useless age, The impatient youth rush forth and fly to arms. [to Arc. aside.] Observe him, Arcas, now. [during this speech a page brings the cup to Achilles, who, instead of taking it to Deidamia stands listening to Ulysses. Deid. Pyrrha! Ach. Forgive me: My mind estrang'd awhileâ [takes the cup, then stops again to listen. Ulys. None, none remain Whose bosoms ever felt the stings of honour, Or knew a wish for glory: scarcely virgins, Or tender brides escape the general flame; And those, whom hard necessity detains, Rave at their fate and call the Gods unjust. Deid. What dost thou, Pyrrha? Ach. I attend your will. [presents her the cup. Deid. [aside to Ach. taking the cup.] Ingrate! are these thy boasted signs of love? Ach. [to her.] Be not displeas'd; forgive me, Deidamia. Lyc. Go, place the wonted lyre in Pyrrha's hand. Now, daughter, urge her with accustom'd skill To raise her voice and join the sounding chords: She nothing can deny thee. Deid. [to Ach.] If thou lov'st me Attend my father's wish. Ach. If such your will I shall obeyâO! tyranny of love! [aside. [a page gives him the lyre, and a seat is placed for him near the table. Theag. [aside.] I am bewilder'd whilst I see two maids Thus knit in strange affection. Ulys. [aside to Arc.] Arcas, hear: Now is the timeâthou know'stâ Arc. I know it well. [Exit. [Achilles takes his seat and sings, accompanying his voice with the lyre. When love has firmly bound the soul, And bid the heart obey, He rules the will without control, And rules with tyrant sway. His cruel frauds, on every hand, He spreads alike for all: Not valour can his power withstand, And wisdom's self must fall. If Jove, of gods and men the sire, In snowy plumage drest, Essay'd with tuneful notes to fire The tender Leda's breast: If once amongst the herds he pac'd For fair Europa's sake; 'Twas love who thus the god debas'd Such borrow'd forms to take. Whoe'er betray'd by female smiles Would join the train of Love, Too late shall find his cruel wiles, And lasting sorrow prove. The tyrant wills that every slave Should kiss the galling chains; Should boast the sufferings Beauty gave, And triumph in his pains. [here the song is interrupted by the followers of Ulysses bringing in the presents for the king. Lyc. Say, who are these? Ulys. My followers, mighty prince, Who humbly lay before your royal feet These slender presents brought from Ithaca. Forgive the freedom, if in these I offer The accustom'd thanks of no ungrateful guest. If I presume too much, my country's usage Must plead forgiveness for me. Lyc. Gifts like these Speak well the generous donor Ach. [approaching observes the armour.] Heavenly powers! What do I see! Lyc. [looking at the vests.] Not even in princely Tyre No purple ever glow'd with brighter hue. Theag. [looking at the vases.] I ne'er till now beheld the sculptur'd vase So fram'd and fashion'd by a master hand. Deid. [looking at the jewels.] And never sure on India's wealthy shore Were seen such dazzling gems. Ach. [goes nearer.] What eyes till now Have e'er beheld such glorious splendid arms? Deid. [aside to Ach.] What would'st thou, Pyrrha? Go, resume the lyre, And tune again thy song. Ach. [returning to his seat.] O pain to suffer! Cry within. To arms! to arms! [a noise is heard of arms and warlike instruments: all the guests rise with looks of astonishment and fear except Achilles, who remains seated with an intrepid air. Arcas re-enters with seeming terror. Lyc. What sudden tumult's this? Ach. Ulysses, haste And curb thy followers' fury. Ulys. What has chanc'd? Arc. I know not why, but with the royal guards They mix in cruel fight: expect this moment To see a thousand threatening falchions drawn. Deid. Assist me, Gods! O! whither shall I fly To save me from their fury? [runs out. Theag. Princess, stayâ [follows her. Within. To arms! to arms! [Lycomedes draws his sword and runs to the tumult. Noise of arms continues. All fly but Ulysses, Arcas and Achilles. Ulysses and Arcas stand apart to observe Achilles, who starts from his seat with great emotion. SCENE IX. Achilles, Ulysses and Arcas apart. Ach. Almighty powers! where am I? What did I hear? Methinks I feel my hair Upstart with frenzy! Ah! what cloud is this Obscures my sight! What sudden fire now glows Within my bosom!âI can hold no longerâ To arms! to arms! [walks to and fro with a furious air, then suddenly stops and observes the lyre still in his hand. Ulys. [to Arc.] Observe him, Arcas, well. Ach. And is this lyre a weapon for Achilles? No, fortune now provides me nobler arms More worthy of meâHence! to earth, to earth! Vile instrument of shame! [dashes it on the ground, and goes to the table to take the arms from the presents brought by Ulysses. This hand debas'd Shall wield the ponderous buckler's honour'd weight, And this the gleaming sword. [takes the shield and sword. Ah! now I feel, I know myself AchillesâLead me, Gods! To meet the glorious labours of the field, And dare with single force a thousand foes. Ulys. If this be not Achilles, tell me, Arcas, What hero shall we name him? [coming forward. Ach. Heavens! Ulysses! What would'st thou say? Ulys. Exalted youth! Achilles! Offspring of Gods! at length permit Ulysses To clasp thee to his breast: 'tis now no time For vain dissimulationâthou art he, The hope, the glory of exulting Greece, And Asia's terror. Wherefore then suppress The great emotions of thy generous heart? Are they not worthy of thee? O! indulge, Indulge them, noble youthâI see, I see Thou canst no more disguise themâCome, I'll guide thee To victory and triumph. Greece, in arms, Awaits but thee, and Asia's hostile sons Shall tremble at thy single nameâaway! Ach. Then lead me hence; conduct me where thou wiltâ But yet, Ulyssesâ Ulys. Whence this sudden pause? Ach. And what of Deidamia?â Ulys. Deidamia Will see thee on some future day return, With laurels crown'd, more worthy of her love. Ach. But whilst, alas!â Ulys. Yes, whilst the earth is fill'd With war's destructive flames, would'st thou, conceal'd From every eye, here linger out thy life In vile repose? Remotest times shall tell How fierce Tydides sapp'd the Dardan walls; How Hector from Idomeneus obtain'd His arms and spoils; how Sthenelus and Ajax Laid Priam's throne in ashes; whilst Achilles, (What did Achilles?) he, in female garb Amongst the maids of Scyros dragg'd his days, Lull'd by the distant sound of valiant deeds. Forbid it, Gods! O! rouse at lengthâefface This blot of honourâO! permit no longer That any eye should see that vile disguise. O! could'st thou in thyself behold a prince, A warrior thus disgrac'd with all the mockery Of female trappings!âIn that shield reflected Thou may'st contemplateâKnow'st thou there Achilles? [points to the shield. Ach. O! treble shame! off! off! ye foul disguises! Reproach to manhood! [tears his vests.] How have I endur'd them? Ulysses, hence to sheath these limbs in arms, Nor let me longer pine in shameful bonds. Ulys. Follow me thenâ[aside.] The day at length is ours. [as they are going on one side Nearchus enters on the other. SCENE X. Enter Nearchus. Near. Where goest thou, Pyrrha? Pyrrha. Ach. [turning.] O! thou base-one! Let not that name again escape thy lips, Nor dare henceforth remind me of my shame. Near. Hear meâand wilt thou thus depart? Thy princessâ Ach. Tell her from meâ Ulys. Achilles, let us go. Near. What can I say from thee to Deidamia? Ach. O! tell her, midst her cruel woes, To love me still, nor vainly mourn: To her Achilles constant goes, And constant will to her return. Tell her those lovely eyes alone Shall ever rule my faithful heart: She ever there maintain'd her throne, And thence she never shall depart. [Exit with Ulysses. SCENE XI. Nearchus alone. Eternal powers! what sudden storm has wreck'd My dearest hopes! And should Achilles go Where shall I fly? Ah! who will save me then From angry Thetis? After years of care, Such toils, such watchings, every art employ'd? O! Heavens! SCENE XII. Enter Deidamia. Deid. [entering.] Where is he? Lead me, lead me to himâ Where is my life, my love? Near. Ah! Deidamia, Achilles is no longer yours. Deid. Nearchus, What mean thy fatal words? Near. Alas! my princess, He leaves you, he forsakes you. Deid. Oft before Thy vain suspicions have alarm'd my fears. Near. Would I were still deceiv'd!âAlas! Ulysses Has now discover'd all; has found Achilles, And forc'd him hence. Deid. And could'st thou thus, Nearchus, Permit him to depart? O! haste, pursue himâ Ah! wretched Deidamia!âhear me yetâ This stroke indeed was death!âwhy dost thou tarry?â Did I not send thee hence? Near. I go, my princess, But all I fear in vain. [Exit. SCENE XIII. Deidamia alone. Achilles leaves me! Achilles then forsakes me!âAh! ingrate! And could he harbour such a thought and live? Is this his promis'd faith? Are these the fruits Of long protesting love?âBut while I rave In fond complaints, the traitor spreads his sailsâ O! let us haste to stop his treacherous flight. My sorrow knows no boundsâawayâshould all Avail me nothing, let the perjur'd man See Deidamia on the shore expire, Then sail in triumph from the port of Scyros. SCENE XIV. Enter Theagenes. Theag. O! princess most belov'dâ Deid. [aside.] Ill-tim'd intrusion, To break on my distraction! Theag. Ah! permit me To learn the soft emotions of your heart, If yet your loveâ Deid. It is not now a time To talk of love. Theag. Yet hear me. Deid. O! forbearâ Theag. But for a moment. Deid. [impatiently.] O! Immortal powers! Theag. At length, my plighted bride, at early dayâ Deid. For pity's sake distract me now no moreâ See'st thou not, cruel, how distrest, A thousand torments rend my breast, That all I ask is lasting rest, Which only death can give? And see'st thou not my tortur'd mind Detests itself, detests mankind, And longer loathes to live? [Exit. SCENE XV. Theagenes alone. Mysterious all! what wisdom can explain The wonders of this day? What means the princess? What can her words import? She surely raves, Or seeks to shake my reason. Do I dream? Wake, wake, TheagenesâHow art thou lost, Without a clue to tread this various maze! Did she in truth, or sportive strain Address my wondering ear? I seek to explore her sense in vain, And doubt of all I hear. By sympathy, in sorrow join'd, We others' sighs partake; Then sure another's frantic mind In ours may frenzy wake. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Porticoes of the palace adjoining to the sea. Ships near the shore. Ulysses, Achilles in a military dress. Ulys. Achilles, I confess the hero now; I see thee all thyself. O! how the dress Of female weeds obscur'd thy godlike mien! Behold the warrior now. The serpent thus Forth issues to the sun, with youth renew'd, And as he rides on golden spires, or trails His lengthen'd curls, rejoices in his strength. Ach. To thee, O mighty chief, Achilles owes A life restor'd: but like a captive scarce Releas'd from bonds, I doubt my freedom still; Still seem to view the dungeon's dreary gloom, And hear the clanking of inglorious chains. Ulys. [looking out.] Why comes not Arcas yet? [aside. Ach. Are these, Ulysses, Thy ships that sail'd from Greece? Ulys. They are: nor less Will these with pride exult, than Argo once, To bear their glorious burthen, while Achilles Can singly weigh against that band of heroes, And all the treasures brought from Phryxus' shore. Ach. Then wherefore this delay? Ulys. Ho! mariners, Approach the landâ[aside.] And yet I see not Arcas. Ach. Why are not these Scamander's hostile shores? There, there it shall be known how soon Achilles Will cancel every fault, when glorious toils Of fighting fields shall wash my stains away. This sword shall plead forgiveness for the hours, The slothful hours of Scyros: then perhaps My trophies gain'd may swell the trump of fame, And leave no time to blaze my follies past. Ulys. O! glorious warmth! O! godlike sense of shame! That well befits Achilles: never, never Such virtue could be hid from human kind, And buried in the narrow bounds of Scyros. Too far, O Thetis! thy maternal fears Betray'd thy better sense: thou might'st have known That here to keep conceal'd so fierce a flame, All arts were vain and every labour fruitless. Enclos'd in earth's capacious caves, A smother'd fire indignant raves, And bursts at length its narrow bound; Proud cities, woods, destroys and burns, And forests shakes, and hills o'erturns, And spreads a ghastly ruin round. Ach. Behold the vessels now approach the shore: Ulysses, follow me. [going towards the sea. SCENE II. Enter Arcas in haste. Ulys. [aside to Arc.] Arcas, what means Thy long delay? Arc. Let us with speed embark Lest aught obstruct our purpose. Ulys. Say what mean'st thou? Arc. Depart, depart, and thou shall learn it all. Ulys. Give me at least some token. Arc. Deidamia, Wild with her love, and blinded with her rage, Pursues our steps: I could no longer stay her, And flew before to bear the unwelcome tidings. Ulys. This dangerous meeting must not be, my Arcas. Ach. [returning impatient.] Why do we linger thus? Ulys. Behold me ready. Ach. [to Arc.] What cause disturbs thee thus? say, Arcas. Arc. Nothing. Ulys. Let us depart. Ach. [to Arc.] What mean those frequent looks Cast back with anxious search? What fear'st thou? Speak. Ulys. [aside.] O! mighty Gods! Arc. [to Ach.] My lord, I fear, perhapsâ The king perhaps may hear of our departure, And seek by force to stay us. Ach. Seek by force? Am I his prisoner then, and would he thusâ Ulys. Noâbut 'tis prudent we should fly from all That might detain us. Ach. Shall Achilles fly? Ulys. Let us not waste the time in vain delays: Haste to the seaâthe winds and waves invite us. [takes Achilles by the hand, and goes with him towards the sea-shore. SCENE III. Enter Deidamia. Deid. Ah! whither, whither goest thou, O! Achilles? Yet stay and hear me. [Achilles turns and sees Deidamia: both remain some time silent. Ulys. [aside.] Now indeed I fear. Arc. [aside.] Behold where love and glory both contend. Deid. Inhuman man! and is it possible? Could'st thou then leave me? Ulys. [aside to Ach.] If thou mak'st reply Thou art vanquish'd. Ach. [to Ulys.] Fear me not; whate'er my feelings, I'll struggle to suppress them. Deid. Such reward, O cruel! dost thou yield for love like mine? Could such a form conceal a treacherous heart? Learn hence, too easy maidens, learn from him To trust a lover's faith: even now he swore Eternal constancy, and in a moment Forgets it allâdeparts, forsakes me thus, Without one tender sigh, one last adieu. Ach. [aside.] My breaking heart! Arc. [aside.] He melts. Deid. What cause could make thee At once my foe? Alas! what have I done? What crime of mine can merit thus thy hatred? Ach. No, princess, noâ Ulys. Achillesâ Ach. [to Ulys.] But one word: I ask no more. Ulys. [aside.] Then all is lost. Ach. [to Deid.] No, princess, Believe me not a traitor or thy foe: Eternal truth I've sworn and I will keep it. The rigid laws of honour tear me from thee; But I'll return more worthy of thy love. If silent I depart, think not my silence Was scorn or hatred: O! 'twas fear and pity. Pity for thee, a prey to tender sorrow, And fear that constancy in me would prove Unequal to the task: the first, alas! I well foresaw, the last I dar'd not trust. I know thou lov'st me dearer than thy life, And well I knowâ Ulys. Achilles. Ach. See me here Prepar'd to quit the port. Arc. [aside.] And yet he comes not. Ach. [to Deid.] Still in my breastâ Deid. No moreâ'tis now too lateâ Forgive my transports to excess of love. 'Tis true, Achilles owes himself to Greece, To all the world, and to his own renown. Then goâno longer I oppose thy purpose: My heart's affection shall attend thee still; But since I here without thee must remain, O! be the stroke less dreadfulâleave me not Thus unprepar'd: allow my feeble virtue Some time for recollectionâbut one dayâ I ask no moreâgo then, depart in peace. Such grace is not denied a wretch condemn'd To meet his death; and can I doubt Achilles Will now refuse this grant to Deidamia? Arc. [aside.] If she obtain a day she conquers all. Deid. Ah! thinkâAh! speakâthy downcast eyes are fix'd In pensive silence still. Ach. [to Ulys.] What says Ulysses? Ulys. 'Tis at thy choice, Achilles, to depart, Or here abide: to me is not permitted A longer tarriance here: resolve to quit The port, or leave me to embark alone. Ach. [aside.] O! cruel state! Deid. Yet answer me, Achilles. Ach. Fain would I stay in pity to thy grief, But heard'st thou not Ulysses? [points to Ulys. Ulys. Wellâresolve. Ach. [to Ulys.] I would pursue thy steps, but seest thou not Who pleads against thee? [points to Deid. Deid. 'Tis enoughâI see Thy choice is made and thou prepar'st to leave me. Go then, ungrateful man! farewell for ever. [going. Ach. Stay, Deidamia. [follows her. Ulys. I perceive, Achilles, Thy purpose to remain. Irresolute, Degenerate youth! I leave thee and depart. [going. Ach. Ulysses, stay. Deid. [to Ach.] What would'st thou? Ulys. Whither tends Thy purpose now? Ach. I would, my Deidamia, Indulge thy wishâ[aside.] O Heaven! what means this weakness. [to Ulys.] To thee, Ulysses, would I yield my guidanceâ [aside.] But this were surely cruelâIf my glory Exact obedience here, there love denies it. Arc. [aside.] 'Tis doubtful which will conquer. Deid. Since to grant me So light a boon excites such painful struggles, I press no furtherâyet one grace I ask More worthy thee: depart, but ere thou goest, Deep in my bosom plunge thy glorious sword, This will avail us both: for thou, Achilles, Wilt thus begin to inure thy soul to slaughter, And Deidamia shun a lingering death: So may'st thou gladly go, and go unquestion'd. I die content, if he, whom still my heart Must ever love, dear master of my fate, If he, alas! who has refus'd me life, At least in pity thus concludes my woes. [weeps. Arc. [aside.] Were I Achilles I could hold no longer. Deid. Thy last best giftâ Ach. Ah! ceaseâlament no more: Ulysses, longer to reject her suit Were useless cruelty. Ulys. So thinks Achilles. Ach. She asks but for a day; a single day May surely be indulg'd me. Ulys. Not a day. I go to tell the assembled Argive chiefs The glories of Achilles; yes, from me Each ear may learn what generous toils have cleans'd His fame; what great amends his sword has made For all his sloth at Scyros, and by him What numerous trophies fill the mouth of fame. Ach. But valour loses notâ Ulys. Talk not of valour. Strip off those arms, a useless load for Pyrrha. What ho! bring forth the hero's silken robes, And let him rest awhile: his fainting brows Enough have felt the helmet's massy weight. Arc. [aside.] How well Ulysses proves his every art To rouse the latent hero. Ach. [to Ulys.] Am I Pyrrha? To me the silken robes? Ulys. O! noâthou giv'st Great proofs of manly mind: thou canst not conquer One weak, one poor affection. Ach. [firmly.] Better learn To know Achillesâlet us go. Deid. Achilles: And wilt thou leave me? Ach. Strong necessity Compels me. Deid. Say'st thou? Ach. Longer to remain Were fatal to my honourâDeidamia, Farewell! [goes resolutely to the ship; is about to ascend the deck, then stops. Ulysses and Arcas follow. Deidamia continues some time immoveable. Arc. [aside.] Ulysses' taunts at length have rous'd His sleeping honour. Ulys. [aside.] Yet we are not secure. Deid. Barbarian! traitor! wilt thou then be gone? Is this a lover's parting?âTyranny Beyond example!âHence thou fly'st from me, But shalt not fly from HeavenâIf Gods are just, And pity human sufferings, all will join To punish thy misdeeds: my injur'd ghost Shall haunt thy sight and witness my revenge. Already now my soul enjoys the thought!â I see the lightnings flashâO! no, forbear, Vindictive powers!âif one must pay the forfeit, O! spare that breast belov'd and strike at mine. If cruel he has chang'd his former self, Yet Deidamia's heart is still the same: For him I liv'd, for him I now will die. [faints. Ach. Ah! let me flyâ [to Ulys. Ulys. And whither would Achilles? Ach. To save my Deidamia. Ulys. Then no longerâ Ach. And canst thou hope that I will leave her thus? Ulys. Are these thy proofs of valour? Ach. [in anger.] Thou would'st ask For proofs of valour, proofs of cruelty. âUlysses, give me way. [breaks from him and runs to Deidamia. Arc. [aside.] Then Love has conquer'd. Ach. My life! my princess! hear meâmighty Gods! She answers notâlift up those lovely eyes, Behold, behold thy own Achilles here. Ulys. I fear, my Arcas, 'tis not now a time To hope for victory: we must resign The palm, and seek the field with other arms. [Exit with Arcas, unseen by Achilles. SCENE IV. Deidamia, Achilles. Deid. Ah! me. [recovering. Ach. The Gods be prais'd! she breathes again. âO! no, my hope, Achilles will not leave thee. Deid. Art thou indeed Achilles? Sure I dreamâ What would'st thou now? Ach. All peace to thee, my love. Deid. Could'st thou, unkind, refuse a single day? And now thou com'stâ Ach. It was not I oppos'd Thy gentle wishâbehold thy foeâbut, ha! What can this mean? Ulysses is not here: He leaves me then. SCENE V. Enter Nearchus. Near. If you would find Ulysses, He seeks the king, and with his sanction means To bear you, thus discover'd, to his ships. Deid. This only wanted to complete my sufferings: All must be then reveal'd to Lycomedes. Near. Believe not now your secret first disclos'd. Theagenes, alarm'd at your distraction, Soon found the cause, and hasted to the king, Who holds him now in converse. Deid. O! ye Powers! Unhappy Deidamia! what has fate In store? If you, Achilles, should forsake me, Where shall I fly for pity? Ach. I forsake thee In such a trial!ânoâmy first exploit Would then be impious treason: calm thy fears, And trust to me thy fortune and my own. May heavenly powers thy peace redeem, And give thy tears relief; And hope, like summer meteors, stream Through transient clouds of grief. Those eyes shall point their guiding ray In love and honour's course; 'Tis they that give and take away My courage and my force. [Exit. SCENE VI. Deidamia, Nearchus. Deid. Support me, O! Nearchus, give me comfort. Near. Alas! what comfort can I give, oppress'd With doubts and terrors that exceed thy own? Deid. Ye pitying Gods! if my affections ever Were innocent and pure, do you protect me: Dispel the cloud that wraps me thus in darkness. If love's a crime, I must confess I err'd; If love like mine be guiltâI lov'd Achilles. Let all, who now my passion blame, Those manly beauties trace; And learn, what best defends my fame, From that enchanting face. That face, which seems by Heaven design'd To kindle Love's alarms, Bespeaks no less a hero's mind To dare the field in arms. [Exit. SCENE VII. Nearchus alone. Go, go, Nearchus, now, and proudly triumph In all thy prosperous cares: to Thetis tell How arts, like thine, could tame the fierce Achilles. Boast every studied speech of fawning flattery, And all thy soothing phrase of timid counsels. Lo! how thy hopes are crush'd: Ulysses singly Has baffled every plan.âWhat stars averse Could send this crafty Greek to Scyros' shore? I yield to fate, my hopes are crost; My strength is gone, my courage lost: Against me winds and waves prevail; My oars are broke and rent my sail, And nought remains my bark to guide, That floats at random down the tide. [Exit. SCENE VIII. The Palace. Lycomedes, Achilles, Theagenes, attendants. Ach. And does not Lycomedes deign to answer When thus Achilles sues? Theag. Great king, what means This doubtful silence? Yield, O! yield at length To my request, and to Achilles' wishes. Why do you pause? Perhaps your mind revolves The promise given to me: but think not, sir, Theagenes so weighs his little merits Against such nuptials. Well I know from these What earth and heaven expect. The Gods themselves Have fram'd this union: Fate could never weave Such strange events but for mysterious ends. Does love offend you? In a virtuous bosom Can love be guilt? Perhaps your mind revolts From such a fraud; but Thetis here is guilty, And Thetis now is punish'd. Thus attir'd, She hop'd from every eye to hide her son, And made him known to all. These spousal rites Will glad the exulting earth, that ne'er till now Beheld such valour, worth and beauty join'd. On these what favouring grace will Heaven bestow, Both sprung from heavenly seed! What sons from these Our hopes may form, when, Lycomedes, you, And you, Achilles, boast for ancestry A countless line of heroes? Ach. [aside.] Could I ever Have hop'd Theagenes to plead my cause? Lyc. Achilles, yes, a name so great as thine Engrosses all my thoughts. What can I answer To nuptials so desir'd? Theagenes With generous zeal approves, and Heaven commands them. Thou ask'st her hand, Achilles, and a father Confirms the grant. With wonder I contemplate Such strange adventures, and in these, respectful Adore the wisdom of the immortal powers. Ach. Ah! Lycomedes, ah! Theagenesâ O! fly and hasten hither to my sight My love, my plighted bride. [to the attendants. [to Theag.] Ah! prince, to thee What does Achilles owe? My lord, my father, How shall my soul with gratitude repay This precious gift? [to Lyc. Lyc. Enough for Lycomedes To be the father of a son like thee. Since thou art mine let Fortune deal The worst a mortal fears: I scorn each foe, and less I feel The weight of drooping years. Thus he, that on some ancient tree Engrafts a tender shoot, Shall springing greens and blossoms see Adorn the wasting root. SCENE IX. Enter Ulysses. Ach. O! come, Ulysses, thou perhaps hast heard Achilles' happiness. Ulys. Far other cares Have brought me hither. [to Lyc.] Mighty king, it now Imports that all disguise be cast aside: I must at length declare the will of Greece: Know thenâ Lyc. Already is it known, Ulysses, And every part shall meet a fair reply. SCENE LAST. Enter Deidamia attended. Ach. [meeting Deid.] O! dearest, best belov'd! and art thou come To bless these eyes? Did I not tell thee, sweet, That still for us propitious fate would smile? Deid. [kneels to Lyc.] My king, my father, prostrate at your feetâ Lyc. Rise, Deidamia, 'twere superfluous now To hear thee further. I already know The high decrees of Heaven. With me it rests To end a mighty contest. Hear, my daughter; Glory and Love with rival power contend To usurp their empire o'er Achilles' heart. This seeks to make it but the gentle seat Of soft affections: THAT would banish all But martial ardors: both alike unjust In either claim. Declare, even thou, Ulysses, What were our hero's praise, to breathe alone Fury and wrath? And say, my Deidamia, What were Achilles should he languish ever In love's enfeebling cares? No, let him go To where the trumpet's noble call invites him, But let him go thy husband: to thy arms Again returning grac'd with glorious wreaths; Repose shall thus relieve the toils of honour, The toils of honour dignify repose. Ach. What says my Deidamia? Speak. What says The sage Ulysses? Deid. When a father wills, No voice has Deidamia. Ulys. Greece, O! king, Shall hear and shall applaud your wise decree. Ach. Then nothing more remains to crown our bliss. Lyc. Let now the bands, by either long desir'd, Unite the illustrious pair, while Love and Glory Henceforth are one, and join in lasting peace. Chorus. Behold, behold, ye happy pair! Descending soft through yielding air, Where Hymen shews his torch from far, His purple veil expands. Behold the God with smiles sustain The links that frame the marriage chain, For you, on Heaven's ethereal plain, Prepar'd by heavenly hands. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
