      <field name="fulltext">THE Fall of SAGUNTUM. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At vos SidereÃ¦, quas nulla Ã¦quaverit Ã¦tas, Ite decus terrarum animÃ¦, venerabile vulgus, Elysium, &amp; castas sedes decorate Piorum. Sil. Ita. de Bel. Pun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable Sir Robert Walpole, Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by Mr. THEOBALD; And Spoken by Mr. QUIN. When awful Rome became the savage Spoil Of wild Ambition, and of factious Broil; When by the Ruin Tyrant Nero rose, Lucan found Cause for Triumph from her Woes: He pardon'd all the Civil Sword had done, And bless'd the War, which fix'd That Nero's Throne. So, poor Saguntum! tho' we justly rate Thy mighty Suff'rings and disastrous Fate; Yet if the dread Misfortune give us Right To claim the Tragic Pleasures of To-night, Well art thou fall'n,âmore nobly here to rise,â And boast thy Doom, bewept by British Eyes! Well is your Famine paid, and well your Flame, Which blazes still the distant Theme of Fame. Britons, our Scene a pompous Tale displays Of Woes unmatch'd on the Records of Praise; A Patriot-People, who Death's Terrors scorn, But dread the Breach of Leagues, and Friendship sworn: The willing Victims to a virtuous Name, All perish greatly, not to live with Shame. The brave Example pictur'd to your Eyes, Be just, and your own Virtues recognize: Applaud the Bard, whose artful Muse has known To trace the Springs of Worth, so much your own. Our British Arms this gen'rous Pride avow, To guard Allies,âand Empires to bestow.â If We did e'er to our own Honours fail; If e'er unhappy Counsels did prevail To let a brave Confed'rate miss our Aid, Be That ill-fated Period thrown in Shade! Or, to erase the memorable Blame, Let's mend by Glory what we can't disclaim!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. YOUNGER. Bless me! what means this Crowding here to Day? Sure, no Conspiracy, to damn the Play. Beaux, can there be such mortal Spleen in you? Or is't meer Want of Something else to do? I've hit itâfor, methought, I heard you say, âPr'ythee, does Violante shew to Day?â âBut for our Plays, gads-curse, they're all such Stuff!â âYet Wagner and Abericock is well enough. For us, our Bard persuades us, that he means To form this Moral from his Tragic Scenes; That, after all, there is some Sort of Merit In that old fashion'd Thing, call'd, Publick Spirit. We'll grant him then, at least for ought we know, There might have liv'd, two thousand Years ago, Such errant Patriots, such poor virtuous Elves, As still preferr'd the Publick to themselves.â At our Assemblies had they pass'd their Nights, Or stood one Stripping at the Den at White's, The good Saguntines scarce had prov'd so steady, But every prudent Man had touch'd the Ready. As for poor Fabius, once I gave him over, And almost lost the General in the Lover. Methought, he found his Dearee so inviting, He'd more a Mind to something else than fighting. Just so 'twould happen here,âshould War's Alarms Summon our powder'd Heroes to their Arms; Lord, what a Bustle would there be, what Rout! What Friends, what Int'rest makingâto sell out. There, all our Beaux would emulate our Roman: Ah! Ladies,âThey're the Soldiers for a Woman. Well,âyou have seen our best Endeavours us'd, To grace a Work our Rivals had refus'd. 'Tis yours, to judge the injur'd Poet's Cause, And give him full Revenge in your Applause: Then view our willing Toils with friendly Eyes, And, from Saguntum's Fall, this Theatre shall rise.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE, before the Temple. Enter Fabius and Curtius. Fab. The Day returns, and with it our Reproach, Th' eternal Infamy of guilty Rome. Shall then the Sun, O Curtius, shame a Roman? And must we shrowd ourselves in Night's dark Covert? The Night, that scantling gives the Villain Comfort, His short Vicissitude from conscious Thought. Curt. Partaker in the Grief, unable to refute, I hear these Words fall from a Roman Tongue; Fruitless the Search, nor can we ought alledge, To salve the wounded Honour of our Country: What shall our Foes report? Fab. âAh, rather say, What shall our Friends, the greatly wrong'd Saguntines? By Heav'n, I'd rather face a Troop of Foes, Than meet one injur'd Friend; yet here, alas! Thy self excepted, I see none but such. Nay, thou art injur'd too; thy constant Friendship Has drawn thee into a long Train of Woes. Curt. Fabius; no more, I beg thee, on that Subject; Can'st thou then think me recreant at the last? Or will my Friend grudge me my Share of Glory, The late, but sure, Reward of manly Bearing? Know, I rejoice that I am with thee here; Know, I rejoice that I shall with thee fall: For fall, 'tis sure, we must; nor let thy Love For fair Timandra give thee other Thoughts. We must not live to see the City taken; But, bravely dying in Saguntum's Cause, May our Blood expiate our Country's Shame. Fab. When Life with Honour comes in Competition, To thee I need not, sure, point out my Choice; And yet thy Words have rais'd a Tempest in me, A Storm that shatters, and o'erbears all Reason. Did'st thou not, Curtius, say, The City taken? Shall Fabius live to see that dismal Scene? Oh, no; and yet, methinks, I should; for where Shall poor Timandra, lovely, wretched Maid, Then fly for Refuge from some Lybian's Lust? O Torture, Torture! can I bear the Thought! Shall she not then, in Bitterness of Soul, In the sharp Anguish of her bleeding Heart, When the hot Slave, fir'd at her nearer Charms, Shall drag her from the Altar to Pollution, With unavailing Shrieks call out for Fabius? Oh, Curtius, Oh! [Leans upon him. Curt. Cease to torment thy brave, yet tender Heart With Ills imaginary, which the Gods, If I aright divine, shall never suffer. Nor would the Maid, so far I deem her noble, Protract her Life to such a fatal Period. For, sure, in that soft Mould are often cast Heroick, manly Souls; th'illustrious Names Of Clelia and Lucrece adorn our Annals. Their fair Example, and the Roman Blood, That warms the generous Timandra's Heart, Should fire her Soul to worthy Emulation. Thus, do I think, would act thy noble Captive, The fam'd Candace, Amazonian Queen; She, who submitted to thy Arm alone; While circling Foes stood at a Bay around her. But say, how bears her haughty Soul Restraint, The double Bonds of Servitude and Love? Fab. 'Tis there, alas! begins my doubled Woe; 'Tis there I find Alternatives of Grief. To love and be belov'd, yet not possess, Is Pain sufficient to a doating Heart; To be belov'd, yet have not to repay, Is ample Torture to a grateful Soul. Yet so stands my Account. 'Tis sure, the Queen But ill would brook Captivity, did not Love, Superiour to all Cares, take up her Soul: Love there's a turbulent, unruly Guest; For what in others of the Sex is Softness, In her seems but a gentler kind of Frenzy: While, with becoming Pride, that chides my Coldness, Sh' avows a Passion which I dare not see. Curt. But, lo! the Temple of Alcides opens, Saguntum's Founder, and her Tutelar God. Fab. In him we also boast as near a Claim, The mighty Author of the Fabian Race; Let us go in, and pay our Morning Worship. Curt. Yet stay thee, Fabius; for the Priests come forth, As in some grave Procession, two by two, Preceding their great Chief. [Enter, as from the Temple, Theron, attended by the Priests; who, after waiting on him out, retire back into the Temple.] Fab. âThe Warriour Theron. E'er since the Siege began, in Prayers incessant, Or warlike Toils, the brave and pious Priest Labours his Country's Cause; his lofty Stature Suits well the Ensigns of his God; which see This Day he wears, to many a sooty Lybian Portending sure Destruction; he approaches. Hail to thee, worthy Theron! Curt. âTheron, hail! Ther. Good Day to both, ye noble Pair of Romans; Had two more such, with Hector and Ãneas, Defended Ilium's Walls, they now had stood; It's Fate had been revers'd, and into Greece The War's Destruction hurl'd; but Hostile Gods, As then to Troy, now doom Saguntum's Fall: And haughty Juno, unrelenting Step-dame Of the great God, whose memorable Deeds Have fill'd Fame's hundred Mouths, our glorious Founder, Wreaks her insatiate Malice on his People. Fab. Rightly thou hast describ'd the vengeful Goddess, Invet'rate Foe to the whole Dardan Race, The partial Patroness of faithless Carthage: But when I stile her faithless, how, oh Theron, Shall I behold thy Face, or how throw off The great Reproach, which thou, with upright Tongue, Might'st well retort upon the Roman Name? Ther. I would not in that manner wrong thy Virtues, Thou brave Young Man: Has not thy fatal Sword Dealt Death and Havock to Saguntum's Foes? Art thou not here amongst a wretched People By thy own Choice, the City's great Defender, Thy self attoning for an absent Host? T'insult thy noble Nature were a Crime My Soul disdains, and far beneath a Man: Reproach and Obloquy are Female Vengeance. Curt. How gen'rously he waves the shameful Subject, Converting into Praise the great Disgrace! If their own Eulogies the Brave may hear, They're doubly welcome from a Mouth like thine. Fab. Theron, I know the Candour of thy Soul, Too great to join the Guiltless with the Guilty; Yet shall it be sufficient, that we Two Have not to answer for the City's Ruin? What shall our Fathers, Lentulus and Fabius, What shall the Fathers of once glorious Rome, Th'assembled Senate say? where heretofore The Nations wide, next to the Gods themselves, Appeal'd for Justice from th'Oppressor's Sword; While nowâOh Heav'ns! I shame to say the rest. Ther. That Roman Parents, to their darling Glory, Have sacrific'd their Offspring, well I know; Witness stern Manlius, and the juster Brutus; But then those Children had thrown off Obedience, And to strict Justice paid their forfeit Lives: But That, brave Youths, neither to you, nor us, Can kindred Rome impute; in Nought have we Swerv'd from the steady Principles of Honour. If, to be firm and constant to our Leagues, Be to offend, then greatly we've offended; If, to endure the last Extremities Of Sword and Famine merits Desolation, Justly are we abandon'd:â Fab. Hold, I beg thee, O gentle Theron, hold; thy Words, like Daggers, Pierce my sad Heart, fill my swol'n Eyes with Tears, And lay the great Calamity before them. Ther. If in the Contemplation of our Woes, Full of the Miseries Saguntum feels, My Tongue gave Utterance to some harsh Words, Excuse a Weakness due to my lost Country; Nor did I farther mean. Curt. âSparing, indeed, And lightly, dost thou touch on Rome's Offence; But yet, for so would my sad Heart persuade, The News, perhaps, has never reach'd her Shore. Ther. Too sure, alas! the well-appointed Vessel With favourable Gales has plow'd her Passage, And must, long since, have enter'd Tyber's Mouth. But what I rather think, excuse me, Romans, Some wretched Statesmen, aukward Politicians, Rude in the Task, unequal to the Burthen, Or brib'd, perchance, with Carthaginian Gold, Now sway her Senate, and give up her Honour. Fab. Can there be such in that August Assembly? If such there be, who to sinister Ends To sordid Views now sacrifice her Fame; The Roman Genius shall, I trust, hereafter Find out the Perfidy; and with Reproach To future Times, mark their distinguish'd Names. Ther. Mean while, let us perform the Tasks of Virtue, That well become the Soldier and the Man: I think, you came to worship; see, the Gates Are open, and the Priests attend the Altar; Enter and supplicate the God's Assistance. [Exeunt. Enter Eurydamas. Eur. Sure, Theron saw me not; for if he did, He may expect I should attend his Rites; But I have Work in hand of secret Purpose, And secret need be all its wary Steps. The Morn is waxing old; and e'er this Hour My trusty Priest should from the adverse Camp Return, and bring the Tyrian's last Resolves.â Honour! why do'st thou rack my Breast in vain? Fine, specious, airy Name, whose outward Show Turns giddy Brains, and out of Fools makes Madmen! This curs'd Distemper has possess'd the People; Who, blindly doating on their own Destruction, Seem fond of Havock, and enjoy a Famine.â What Ties have I to Faith? In point of Kindred, I am not bound; what, tho' Saguntine born? The Daunian Blood flows not within my Veins: From Grecian Ancestors I trace my Lineage, A gen'rous Race, who, under great Alcides, Fixt here their Seat, and rais'd these lofty Walls. I'm anxious for this slow-pac'd Priest's Return: But, soft! the Noise of FeetâLycormasâ Enter Lycormas. Lyc. âHe: I've shifted Garb, and am again the Priest. Eur. What, from the Carthaginian? Lyc. âHe expects, In Confirmation that our Zeal is true, The Captive Queen be made by our Procurement, The trusty Pledge, and instantly restor'd. Eur. It shall be soâthe Answer speaks him well; At once declares the Gen'ral and the Lover. Yet dang'rous, sure, and difficult the Task To render back Candace to his Wishes! But, what shall not aspiring Hopes attempt? Lyc. And with Success, perhaps; but should that fail, At least we've play'd an artful Aftergame. I've sown my Poyson thick i'th' Tyrian's Breast; That his false Mistress feels her Victor's Charms, And that the Roman meets her proffer'd Flame. Hence, Fabius, when he next goes out to Battle, Shall, with returning Steps, ne'er reach the City, But fall a Victim to th'invented Tale. Eur. Too fine, I fear me, hast thou wove the Web Of thy Design; true, the fictitious Part, That he should love Candace, bears good Meaning; But, then the Truth, that she indeed loves him, Should, to my Thought, have never been reveal'd. It may, perhaps, incline his haughty Soul To slight the keeping of her fickle Heart. Lyc. Canst thou be such a Novice in that Passion? Or, art thou such a Stranger to thy self? Examine thy own Breast, and truly tell me, Whence flows thy Hatred to the noble Fabius? Is not Timandra's Love the real Source? Shall the same Cause then in the Tyrian's Heart Not have the same Effect? it shall, it has: I tell thee, Friend, if Hannibal himself, Joyn'd by the choicest of his Troops in War, Can make the Roman bleed, his Fate is fix'd. Eur. Thy Words have Weight; sure, if there be a Joy Transcends the Raptures ev'n of prosp'rous Love, It must be when our disappointed Passion Finds full Revenge upon a hated Rival, And in the Fav'rite stabs th'ungrateful Fair. Lyc. Enjoy the Thought, for such shall prove th'Event; The mighty Chief, inflam'd at my Relation, Demanded how in Battle he should know him: For, tho' his warlike Name he oft had heard; And fatal Sword had made Candace Captive; Yet such their Destiny and Chance of War, They never in the bloody Field had met. I answer'd short, his Arms might well denote him, The Milk-white Plume that nodded on his Helmet, And Roman Eagle that adorn'd his Shield; But that beyond all these, his mighty Arm, Cutting its Passage through the firmest Ranks, With horrid Slaughter should distinguish Fabius. Eur. I think, thou wer't enamour'd on the Roman, Thy Tongue grew lavish in his fulsome Praise, And wonder much the Chief could bear thy Language. Lyc. Again, but ill the Tyrian dost thou measure; My Words, indeed, inspired his Soul with Rage, A gen'rous Flame that kindled for the Battle: Invet'rate there would he pursue his Life, When from the Field he knows to prize his Valour, And own the Honours that his Virtue merits. From Principles like these his Thoughts are form'd, And hence, I think, it was he talk'd of Murrus. Eur. Ha! said'st thou, Murrus! did he speak of him? Lyc. He did; and with most honourable Mention, That well became a noble Adversary; He prais'd the gallant Actions of the Youth; Wish'd him his Friend, that meriting his Favour, Should Obstinacy still possess the City, And our Designs to give it to his Hands By some sinister Chance abortive prove, Mercy might find him in the gen'ral Ruin. Eur. I will improve the Hint, and stir up Murrus; He loves me well, and wishes me his Sister, [Aside. Irreconcilable in Hate to Fabius: Then he is bold, vindictive, and impetuous, Nor brooks a Rival in his Love, or Glory; His Popularity, as well as Power, Will, if we gain him, further much our Purpose: Yet not at first will I disclose the Whole Of our Intent; but playing with his Passions, Win him, that in Concurrence with the People, He from his Father shall demand Candace, Thoughtless that we design to set her free. Lyc. Success attend th'Attempt, as a good Omen To our chief Work; if Fortune favour that, The City's Government shall then be thine, The Gift of Hannibal, and mine the Priesthood. [Exit. Eur. Perhaps, not so; should Murrus share the Conduct Of this our dark and hardy Enterprize, Too much already in the Tyrian's Favour: Nor can I form a Thought, a Gleam of Hope, His Honour is to be seduc'd so far: Howe'er, at Leisure, I shall better weigh it, For, to the present Purpose, here he comes. Enter Murrus. Mur. Eurydamas, well met; I came to seek thee; But, who was he that quitted now the Place? Eur. It was the Priest Lycormas; he, thou know'st, Is of my Blood, as well as nearest Friendship; A right good Man he is, and worthy well To've wore the Honours which thy partial Father Gave from his just and elder Hopes to Theron. Theron, who favours the perfidious Romans; Theron, who palliates their base Treachery, And speaks of Fabius as a new Alcides. Mur. Curse on his glossing Tongue! his artful Words, That swell each Pigmy Action to a Giant. The glaring Lights, in which he sets to view The Romans Deeds, dazzle Saguntine Eyes, And make them blind to their own Country's Merit. What has his Sword done more than mine in Battle? When in the labour'd Field was I behind him? Unless returning from the warlike Toil.â The Tale of slaughter'd Foes, if right computed, Would set large Numbers upon Murrus Side; And should their Names be weigh'd in Glory's Ballance, His light and trifling Scale would kick the Beam. Eur. His Pride is gaul'd; now let me fire his Love. [Aside. Murrus, thou know'st I love thee as a Brother, And such did my fond Heart once think to call thee, 'Till this curst Fabius robb'd me of that Hope; Then sure thou can'st not doubt I hate the Roman, Our commmon Rival, Bane to both our Passions; 'Tis true, he says, he only loves Timandra, And seemingly neglects the Captive Queen; Yetâ Mur. âWhat? Eur. â'Tis but, perhaps, Surmise;â Mur. âHowe'er Give it. Eur. Should Fabius, brave tho' we allow him, Yet as a Roman he may well prove false, Weighing Events, revolving in his Thoughts The mighty Ruin that hangs hov'ring o'er us, Fly with his Pris'ner to the Tyrian Camp, And at her Ransom, buy his shameful Peace? I say, this he may doâ Mur. âCease, cease to dwell Upon that jarring String, it grates harsh Discord, Ruffles my Soul, and shudders in my Blood. Curst be the Day that she came forth to Battle, Accurst the Chance that gave her to his Sword: Had it been mine, our Fates had been more equal, And we had each been Conquerour in turn, She to my Arm, I to her Beauty, Captive. What's to be done, Eurydamas? Eur. âOnly this, To spread Suspicions that the Queen's unsafe Beneath the Roof of Fabius.âThis believ'd, Contrive she may become our Charge:â Mur. âThe Means? Eur. The People. Thou wer't once their chiefest Darling: Go, try what may be done by Blandishments; Stoop from thy haughty Soul, and court their Favour; Insinuate to them as a certain Truth, What barely we surmise, th'intended Flight; Enrag'd, they shall demand her of thy Father, I'll follow strait, and join my utmost Arts. Mur. It shall be done, I will not lose a Moment: [Going. But haste thee after, for my Stay with them Can be but short; my Father's Rising calls me. [Exit. Eur. The Bait is swallow'd, and the hot-brain'd Youth Ne'er gave himself the Leisure to consider. Sedition, thou art up; and in the Ferment To what may not the madding Populace, Gather'd together for they scarce know what, Now loud proclaiming their late whisper'd Griefs, Be wrought at length? Perhaps, to yield the City. Thus where the Alps their airy Ridge extend, Gently, at first, the melting Snows descend, From the broad Slopes with murm'ring Lapse they glide, In soft Meanders down the Mountains Side; But lower fall'n, Streams, with each other crost, From Rock to Rock, impetuously are tost, 'Till in the Rhone's capacious Bed they're lost; United there, roll rapidly away And roaring reach, o'er rugged Rocks, the Sea. [Exit. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE, the House of Fabius. Enter Candace. Can. How poor a thing is Empire! and how vain, To pride ourselves upon its short-liv'd Glories! The mightiest Monarchs of the peopled Earth Are still the Subjects to Capricious Fortune; And, when she frowns, the Height on which they sit Makes but their Fall more dreadful and conspicuous. A fatal Instance to the World am I, My self a Queen, and great Hiarbas' Daughter; Yet what avail'd his far-extended Sway? What boots it, to have been the Son of Ammon? On yonder Hostile Plain in Death he lies, His Daughter Captive to a petty State: Yet is not This the Sum of my Afflictions; For to my Pride's Confusion,âbut He's hereâ Enter Fabius. Fab. Pardon th'Intrusion that proceeds from Joy, The Joy I have to bring you pleasing News. The Governour proposes to your Chief On honourable Terms to set you free; And such, as were I Hannibal, should ask No second Thought, impatient as he is Of Opposition, and the War prolong'd. Can. If thou wert He, thou would'st be wondrous kind No Doubt! Candace then should have great Power! Talk'st thou of Suppositions! what thou would'st do! Curst, curst Evasion of my proffer'd Love, That meets for Gratitude collusive Words! Well the Saguntines may reproach thy Country, If they, like thee, know no Return of Merit. Fab. Much am I injur'd in that Thought, fair Princess; My Soul's true Sentiments but little known. With grateful Heart I meet your valued Friendship, And deem it Honour done me by the Gods, That to my Lot it fell, in the rude Conflict, To save you from th'unequal Chance of War. Can. Would I had perish'd there!âobdurate Man! Still wilt thou wrest the Purport of my Words? [Turns. I spoke of Love; what dost thou mean by Friendship? Well may'st thou turn aside, thy conscious Eyes Dare not behold the Beauties they have slighted; Charms, that have made rough Hannibal a Lover, Whilst Africk's purpled Monarchs swell the Train; Yet now their Influence is lost; to thee A Queen, an Amazon, is forc'd to sue. But wherefore rave I? Can the Trumpet's Sound Give noble Ardour, where the Ear is deaf? The glorious Sun, that sets off Nature's Face, Shines unperceiv'd by thick and filmy Eyes: Is this Politeness? These your Roman Arts? For this, the Nations round stil'd barbarous? Insensible, poor Wretch! I'll learn to scorn thee. Fab. What shall I say, Illustrious Maid, to calm This Gust of Passion, Tumult of thy Soul? 'Tis sure to you I must appear ungrateful, At least a stupid, despicable Slave, Devoid of Sense, and dead to Beauty's Call: Yet Heav'n can tell how much I prize your Worth, The joint Perfections both of Soul and Form; Think not, a Roman can be Foe to Love; We own his Pow'r, nor does your warmer Sun Shine yet but faintly on our Neighbour Coast. With Admiration I behold your Beauty, Your graceful Figure, and consummate Charms: Unarm'd, great Juno's Majesty you wear: When in the Field, you look another Pallas; And, could the Goddess boast thy various Graces, To her the Trojan Youth had giv'n the Prize. Can. Were I that Pallas, thou the Shepherd Paris, (And sure the Shepherd's Part would suit thee well,) Soft Cytherea would engage thy Choice, As now Timandra bears it from Candace. [Starts. Ha! start'st thou, Roman? Have I told thee false? Fab. Well then, the Secret's out; which, for thy Peace, Industrious did my Tongue strive to conceal; Yet since thou hast it, I'll avow my Passion; The lambent, unextinguishable Flame, Which her soft Eyes, and yet more gentle Virtues, Have kindled in the faithful Breast of Fabius. Can. Am I rejected for a puling Girl? A fondling, soft, domestick Animal; Whose wondrous Talent, whose Perfection is To weave some pretty Story in the Loom; Or with her Lute soften yet more her Soul; A cooing Turtle that bemoans its Mate, Insipid Creature, form'd without a Gall. Fab. Her Talents are not masculine, indeed; To wield the Sword, to strain the twanging Yew, To lash the foaming Steeds, and drive the Car With rapid Wheels o'er mangled Carcasses, She knows not: These are Amazonian Virtues. Yet is she not the less replete with Honour, And noblest Sentiments confirm her Soul. With Female Softness she bewails her Country, With manly Patience she partakes its Hardships; Whilst the poor Pittance, dol'd about with Caution, To fence against, that meager Fiend, the Famine, In Pity she divides with some starv'd Soldier. Can. 'Tis vain, I see, to struggle with my Fate; Yet will my Passion make one last Effort. Now hear me, Fabius, and well weigh my Words. The Terms thou talk'st of from the Governour, Shall they with me give Freedom to thy self? Fab. Amazing Kindness! Can you think that he Would offer thus? Or Hannibal accept? Can. Then 'tis thy Artifice, and poor Invention, To rid thy self of my detested Love; But since that cannot move thy Soul to Softness, Consider well the Dangers that surround thee; These nodding Walls, and their impending Ruin; Short is their Date, and sure Destruction waits them; If Dangers move not, let Ambition fire thee. Of martial Realms, GÃ¦tulian Chiefs, that ride Swift without Bridle, of Marmarick Lands, Thy Captive is the Queen; of these she makes, And of her Virgin Heart, vow'd heretofore To the chaste Huntress Queen, at once the Offer.â Fly with me then from this ill-fated City; Disguis'd, thro' the Sidonian Troops I'll lead thee; And when thy Foot is set on Africk's Shore, It's next Ascent shall be to mount a Throne. Fab. Now hear a Roman speak: That offer'd Throne, And what is yet more worth, thy glorious Self, Were my Heart free, Timandra never known, Should not win Fabius to forsake his Honour: Too much already is my Country censur'd; Shall I by Flight thus add to its Disgrace? Ignoble Thought! no, here my Fate shall find me; In Faith's fair Cause I will resign my Breath, And dying shew, at least, what Romans were:â Yet thus in Gratitude I bow before thee, Imploring the Good Gods on thy Behalf, In Safety may'st thou reach thy native Land, In Glory may'st thou reign its mighty Queen; While some deserving Monarch shares thy Bed, Enjoying Beauties Fate deny'd to me. Can. Are these thy Pray'rs? To me they are but Curses; And in Return what should I beg for thee? But my big Heart disdains a further Converse; Thy own Stupidity be on thy Head, For sure, if not my Love could warm thy Breast, In this at least thy groveling Soul is shewn, To spurn at Empire, and refuse a Crown. [Exit. Fab. 'Tis true, Ambition never was my View, Tho' Glory still has been my great Pursuit; I would, by noble Actions in her Service, Deserve the utmost Honours of my Country, Nor higher do my Thoughts affect to rise. And to a gen'rous Soul the virtuous Rule O'er a free People, chearfully obeying, Must bring more real, and sublimer Joy, Than can be in the most Despotick Sway. But my own Passion now requires Attendance; And more than time I paid it at the Palace. The watchful Governour will soon come forth To chear the People with his wonted Goodness; And with his Presence animate the Soldier. [Exit. SCENE changes to the Palace of the Governour. Enter Sicoris, Murrus and Timandra. Sic. Tho' twice four Moons the Tyrian has begirt, With Troops unnumber'd as his Africk Sands, Our Walls; yet still, tho' shatter'd, they remain; Our Tow'rs, tho' shaken, still erect their Heads, And threaten in their Fall to crush the Foe. Mur. Thus low reduc'd, thus sore distress'd by Famine, The People still retain their pristine Valour; Patient they suffer all the dire Extremes, While Rest and Sustenance seem Things forgot. Tim. With feeble Steps, upheld by disus'd Spears, Our aged Sires ascend and man the Ramparts, Pour thence in Pray'rs a Flood of Blessings down, And chear with good Presage their sallying Sons. Sic. And such should prove th'Event, were not their Strength Impair'd by Want of Nature's due Refreshments; Strong in their Hearts alone, their Foes they seek, With whom, when met, they deal but slender Blows. Tim. Oh, glorious Love of Liberty and Truth! Oh, pow'rful Force of pure unwav'ring Faith, Saguntum's other Deity rever'd: Relieve, thou Goddess, thy true Votaries, And from thy bless'd Abode show'r down Assistance. Sic. Thou Pow'r divine! born before Jove himself! At once the Glory both of Men and Gods, Consort of Justice, Deity confess'd In ev'ry Bosom where thou deign'st to dwell; Can'st thou, unmov'd, behold thy own Saguntum Oppress'd with Woes surpassing humane Bearing? Woes, that she suffers for thy sake alone? For thee the People die, on thee they call, The rueful Father, and despairing Matron, While famish'd Infants learn to speak thy Name; Oh! let their innocent and piteous Cries Pull down thy Vengeance on our cruel Foes. Tim. This Day, my Father, have the Priests decreed, Directed by their Chief, the pious Theron, To pass in solemn Pomp around the City; With all due Rites and hallowed Ceremonies, Invoking to our Aid AlcmÃ¦na's Son. At the same Time, attended by a Troop Of noblest Virgins, shall Timandra go To Faith's chaste Shrine; there prostrate on the Floor, Our Heads and Hands array'd in purest white, We'll humbly join th'Oblation of our Pray'rs, And from the Goddess beg her kind Protection. Mur. In vain, I fear me, are those Pray'rs prefer'd, While Fate too closely presses on our State, Giv'n up to Ruin by the faithless Romans. Like our great Founder, are we doom'd to fall; Who, after Labours most unparallel'd, Became the Victim of base Treachery. Sic. The War indeed is rather theirs than ours, For Hannibal, through us, but aims at them; With horrid Rites at Proserpine's dark Altar Sworn by his Father, their invet'rate Foe, Implacable he meditates the future War; Already in his Thoughts the Alps are past; The Latian Fields cover'd with Desolation, While floating Carcasses obstruct the Streams; His Thirst of Blood and fierce Imagination Ev'n now give Rome to his destructive Rage; O'er the sev'n Hills the Tyrian Flame ascends, And by himself the Capitol is fir'd. Mur. By Hercules, should all his Hopes be answer'd, 'Twould be but what their Perfidy deserves; Ingloriously to sit, and see a People Fighting their Cause, allied in strictest League, Receive Conditions from a merc'less Victor. Sic. Let not thy Country's Love too far transport Thy juster Thoughts, my Son; for thou shalt find The Romans ever were renown'd for Faith, Rigid Observers of their sacred Compacts, And in their Word, once giv'n, inviolate; Can the whole Earth produce another Instance Equal to that of their great Regulus? Immortal Man! thou dost as far transcend All other Heroes, as the Sun the Stars. Mur. 'Tis true, and therefore shames their present Race: He shou'd by's Truth, methinks, have been Saguntine. Sic. Curb thy licentious Tongue, intemp'rate Boy, Shalt thou presume to scan Rome's awful Councils? The secret Springs, that move the Wheels of Empire, Are wrought too subtle for Youth's giddy Eyes. Assume not to thy self, then, what's above thee; Nor think opprobrious Language makes a Patriot. Enter Theron. Thy Steps are hasty, and thy Looks declare That Haste important; is there ought beside, Than that, perhaps, the Foe appears in Arms? Ther. The Foe, I think, is got within our Walls; A new intestine Foe, accurs'd Sedition: The People mutiny, and thro' the Streets Grumbling they mutter Treachery and Fabius, The Captive Queen, and more such idle Tales, I heeded not; but hither bent me straight, To tell thee this so much unlook'd for Mischief; Be quick, and crush the Monster in its Birth. Tim. Oh! Sir, believe not, Fabius can be guilty Of the least Thought repugnant to his Honour; Virtue to him is all the World can give, He by her strictest Rules his Actions guides; This is vile Calumny and base Aspersion, The ven'mous Offspring of some Villain's Brain, Who hates the noble Youth for being Roman. Sic. Thy Cautions how to think of him are needless, Full well I know, and knowing prize his Worth: Retire, my Child, while I go meet the People; Make thy Heart easy; Fabius be my Care. [Exeunt Theron, Sicoris, and Murrus. Tim. Make him your Care too, ye all-gracious Pow'rs! Protect the lively Pattern of your selves, The Great, the Good, Beneficent and Just. Enter Fabius. Ha! Fabius; sure, he knows not of the News. Fab. The People's Eyes scowl'd on me as I past, And low'ring knit, methought, their angry Brows. Not so their Wont, while Mothers to their Children With grateful grating Words, severely kind, Pointing, would say, there goes indeed a Roman. I know not what to think; but see, Timandra; And in her Presence other Cares are lost. Tim. Did'st thou not meet my Father at thy Entrance? Fab. I did; some slight Disturbance, as he said, Requir'd his Presence in the Forum; told me Thou wer't alone, and pensive; bid me cheer thee; And wish'd me here to stay till his Return. Tim. It was his Care to keep him from the Tumult, [Aside. Which by his Absence best might be compos'd; I take the Hintâthou cam'st, I thought, to cheer me. Fab. Alas! Timandra, can it be, my Tongue Should that impart, which my griev'd Heart ne'er knows? All jocund Thoughts have fled the wretched Fabius, And Cheerfulness and I have long been Strangers. Thy Love alone it is supports my Soul, Try'd by Distress, a sadly pleasing Comfort. Tim. Thy Words, tho' mournful, still have Pow'r to charm, Gently they sooth my most perplexing Fears. With thee conversing I forget my Sorrows, While softer Passions fill their empty Place, Engross my Bosom, and possess me whole. Fab. Nor think, I hear thee speak thus without Rapture; Thy kind Expressions fill my Heart with Transport, Like softest Harmony they reach my Ear, And thrilling Pleasures shoot thro' ev'ry Vein: Yet when they cease, so do not too thy Charms; Speaking, or mute, the Graces wait around thee, And Loveliness attends and forms each Motion. Tim. Thus to thy Eyes I would indeed appear, And thus I do believe thy Passion paints me; When o'er our Hearts fond Love has got Dominion, With his own Blindness he infects his Subjects: Yet whatsoe'er I am, believe me thine, Thine in the last Recesses of my Soul. Fab. Shall I then hear, and only hear the Blessing? While cruel Fate denies me the Fruition. Come, come, my Countrymen; redeem your Honour, And drive these faithless Africans before you. Tim. The very Thought revives me: Should they come,â And sure, methinks, they should, we yet were happy. Fab. Prophetick be thy Words! Let me, great Gods, Behold the glorious Day, when Rome's dread Pow'r Shall muster on yon' Plains her warlike Bands; Soon shalt thou lose thy Fears, and see with Joy The Tyrian Troops dislodge, and fly before them. So when a Mountain Goat some Tiger spies, Browzing the Shrubs, at his full Stretch he flies, Already seiz'd of her with greedy Eyes. From the Rock's Refuge, her securer Haunts, Driv'n o'er the Plain, the wearied Creature pants; Hardly, with Fear, and Toil, her Breath she draws, And now, just now, dreads his protended Claws: If then the lordly Lion come in View, No longer dares he the close Chase pursue; Aw'd, yet with Rage indignant, stalks away, And to the nobler Brute resigns his hard-sought Prey. [Exeunt. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE the Forum. Enter Eurydamas and Saguntines. 1st Sag. Eurydamas, thy Country owes thee much, For this thy watchful Care, and timely Notice Of foul Designs against her. 2d Sag. âWe all thank thee. 3d Sag. And should the Governor refuse us Justice, We'll tear the Ensigns of his Office from him, And to thy Hands, and his brave Son's, commit them. Eur. Their giddy Heat will ruin my whole Plot; For 'tis not They must fix me in that Seat; And Murrus still comes 'cross my best Designs. (Aside.) What mean ye, Friends, and whither do ye run, Mistaking wide the Drift of my Discourse? My slender Services ye far o'er-rate, And rashly censure Noble Sicoris, Your prudent, brave, and resolute Defender. True, he is partial to our faithless Friends, And, blindly honest, thinks the same of Fabius; Who bears dissembled Love to his fair Daughter; From whom when once we shall have stripp'd the Vizor, You need not then to doubt his just Award: But see, he comes; be bold in your Assertions, And confident in your Demands. Enter Sicoris, Theron and Murrus. Sic. âWhence comes it, My Countrymen, that in tumultuous Sort, And sullen Mood, you thus are met together, Doubling the Horrors of War's fearful Visage? What are your Griefs? and whence your Discontent? 1st Sag. Our Griefs are, like our Labours, numberless; And ev'ry Morn, when we awake from Rest, (If any Rest we can be said to have) Sets a new Scene of Misery before us. 2d Sag. How long must we expect these tardy Romans? How long with eager Eyes in vain explore The Sea, that ne'er shall whiten with their Sails? Such is their Faith, their long-expected Aids! Sic. Why they have fail'd, the Gods can only tell; Yet whither tend these Speeches of Reproach? Is Liberty at last grown irksome to you? Or would ye, 'cause they come not, yield the City? Sag. Curse on the Heart that harbours such a Thought! We would not be betray'd by one amongst us; Nor, like AmyclÃ¦, perish by our Silence. Sic. Point out the Man, ye shall have ample Justice. 1st Sag. The Roman Fabius, he, that inmate Traitor. Sic. His Name and Treachery but ill accord; Yet speak, declare, what do you charge on him? 2d Sag. That in Conjunction with the Captive Queen, Whom thy too fond Opinion of his Truth Has still permitted to remain with him, He holds pernicious Councils to the State. 3d Sag. And now has plotted, if nought worse they can, To fly, and yield her to the Carthaginian. Sic. Empty ChimÃ¦ra's, vain and idle Tales! Fictions, irreconcileable to Reason! Did not this Fabius, whom ye now implead, Refuse to go in Embassy to Rome, Our delegated Friend? Had he not then Secure retreated without Stain of Honour; Nor known the Toils and Dangers here he runs? Which of you all has not beheld the Deeds, That in our Country's Cause he has atchiev'd? Misdoubting, thankless, base, ungrateful Men! Eur. By Heav'n, he staggers their irresolute Souls; I must be quick, and reinforce their Clamour. (Aside.) What's this Ingratitude thou dost reproach us? His Cause of Stay was but thy beauteous Daughter, Whose Charms now slighted for the Amazonian, In shameful League combin'd, their Flight he plots. Sic. Now Shame upon thy Tongue, Eurydamas! This is thy Malice to a favour'd Rival, The rankling Sore that festers in thy Breast; Had'st thou believ'd what now thou dost aver, The pleasing Truth had slept within thy Bosom. Are these your Grounds, and his your Informations? (turning to the People.) 1st Sag. Be it sufficient, we believe it Truth; Nor shall we leave without Redress the Place. Mur. And ye shall find it, Friends; my noble Father Presides not but to do the injur'd Justice: Lay your Demands before him without Fear. 2d Sag. Let her be given Eurydamas to keep; To him intrusted, we shall think her safe. Mur. Conclude it done, it is both just and fitting. Sic. How, Boy, dost thou prescribe thy Father Rules? And to Sedition's Voice join thy Accord? I'll teach thee better to behave to both, Thy Parent and thy Country:âA Guard there. Eur. Talk not to us of Guards, we will protect him; 3d Sag. Nor shall he suffer in the People's Cause. Ther. Murrus, without a Pause, implore his Pardon. And thou, O Sicoris, forgive his Fault; A Warmth, that flow'd from a too forward Zeal. Excuse the Rashness of thy wretched People, Who, suff'ring much, worn out with War and Famine, (Which with a Constancy unmatch'd they've born) If blindly drawn, and artfully seduc'd By some officious Villain's busy Tongue, They have presum'd to descant on thy Conduct: And you, my Countrymen, retract your Error: With Eyes impartial view your noble Chief, And recognize his Worth. Has he not been More than your Governor, your common Parent? Has he not pass'd in painful Watch the Night? Consum'd the careful Day in Search of those, Where soft Humanity might best be shewn? For you still provident, careless for himself, Each Day he marks with some distinguish'd Goodness. And do ye thus return the gen'rous Labours? Eur. Now Cankers eat his Tongue: The meddling Priest! See, how he talks them to their former Dotage. (Aside.) Ther. 'Tis Unanimity alone can give Strength to our Cause, and to the City Safety. Then hear what I propose: Will ye confide In me, the Priest of Hercules your God? Within the Temple let the Queen be lodg'd, My self, and holy Brethren, for her Guard. (They seem to confer.) Eur. Perdition seize him, I again am baffled; I read it in their Looks, he has prevail'd. 1st Sag. We are content; that granted we retire. Ther. What say'st thou, Sicoris? Sic. âLet it be so: Theron, unto thy Charge we now commit her; Convey the Royal Captive to the Temple; My self will be the noble Roman's Surety. [Ex. Sicoris, Murrus, Eurydamas and People. Ther. No trifling Labour will it be t'appease The just Resentment that shall fire his Soul: I wish, some other had th'unthankful Office. Enter Fabius and Curtius. Fab. Curtius, I thank thee for thy friendly Call; When Honour is concern'd, Love must give place: But see, the Forum void! Are my Accusers fled? Cur. They durst not stay to brave thy Innocence. Ther. Softly, my Friends; what is to Reason just, Will not of Force convince an inflam'd People: They see with others Eyes; nor will they trust, When cunningly wrought up, their proper Senses. They are retir'd indeed, but on Conditions Such, as I fear, will grate thy gen'rous Soul. Fab. Oh, Theron! if I ever entertain'd Th'abandon'd Thought of what I am accus'd, May'st thou and all good Men renounce me here, Nor in th'Elysian Fields my Soul know Rest! Ther. Needless to me are these thy Imprecations; To me, not Innocence it self is clearer; Thy Name as white as is the new-fall'n Snow. Yet, what I have in Charge permit me tell; In forc'd Compliance to the People's Clamour, (Who by no other Means might be appeas'd,) By me, thy Captive Sicoris requires: From thee, ungrateful Task, I must remove, And in the Temple of Alcides place her. Fab. Too easy Sicoris! Unthankful People! My Soul is touch'd in her most tender Part, My Honour injur'd beyond Reparation; Unheard, unprov'd, thus to be deem'd a Villain! In all the Shapes Ingratitude appears, Her most detested Form is vile Suspicion. Ther. Chafe not thy self about the Rabble's Censure; They blame, or praise, but as one leads the other: Unthinking Souls! that when consider'd singly, How few we find deserve the Name of Man; Yet in Conjunction grow they formidable, And hence from Sicoris have this extorted. Fab. Since to thy Charge the Queen shall be intrusted, With less Regret I yield her from my Care; Yet does my swelling Heart refuse the Office: Curtius, go thou, and spare thy Friend the Shame. [Exeunt Theron and Curtius. To the good Man I smother'd my Resentment, Which, at a proper Time, they dear shall rue. Enter Murrus. But Murrus comes, and on his angry Brow, Like a black Storm, sits low'ring Discontent. He sees, but would avoid me. What, ho! Murrus. Mur. See, I return: What wouldst thou with me, Roman? Fab. Thou call'st me, Roman; such indeed I am, And much I glory in that Appellation; Yet, for I know thou mean'st it in Reproach, I well cou'd wish thee to forget my Country, Since 'tis with friendly Meaning I accost thee. Mur. Forget thy Country!âwould I ne'er had known it, Nor seen in thee a Pattern of her Falshood: Thou who, thus trusted, lodg'd within our Bosoms, Could'st poorly meditate inglorious Flight, And with thee bear away our noblest Captive. Fab. Thou do'st not in thy Heart thus think of Fabius; These harsh Expressions flow but from thy Tongue, The hasty Sallies of mistaken Passion; Thy Bosom must acquit me of the Slander: Too well thou know'st the Love I bear thy Sister, But 'tis Candace's ill-plac'd Flame that galls thee. Why do'st thou frown? Love is not in our Power; Nay, what seems stranger, is not in our Choice: We only love, where Fate ordains we should, And, blindly fond, oft slight superior Merit. Since this the Case, let not her fruitless Passion Estrange thy Heart from one who seeks thy Friendship; Who, pleas'd, beholds thee in a double View, The gallant Youth, and dear Timandra's Brother. Mur. Would that Timandra heard thy nice Discussion On that soft Passion; she, be sure, would thank thee; Think her self much indebted to kind Fate, To whose sole Influence thy Love is due. Fab. Unkindly urg'd; I thought not of my self, Or, what's much dearer than my self, Timandra. Oh! she's all Tenderness and gentle Joy, The smiling Loves play hov'ring round her Lips, And Grace ineffable adorns her Eyes: If she then, thus bedeck'd with all that Nature Could lavish on her with a Hand profuse, Can think of Fabius, and his little Merit, I well might say 'twas Fate that made me happy; Yet is there wanting to confirm that Bliss, Did not th'unhappy Siege forbid my Joys, Thy kind Consent, which still in vain I court; Thy noble Brother, Peace be to his Shade! Was Fabius' Friend, and further'd still my Love; Be thou like him, or tell me why thou art not. Mur. Already thou must know we had two Mothers, Rutulian his, and mine of Grecian Extract, Nearly related to Eurydamas; And if thou wert not, what I scorn, a Roman, Should for that Reason wish my Sister his. Fab. Yet whence this Scorn? and wherefore, tho' a Roman, Am I not worthy of thy Sister's Arms? Do not Rome's Glories fill th'admiring World, Or does the Grecian Name outrival hers? Grant, that my Country should have been to blame, (Yet sure the Day shall come to clear that Crime) Speak with impartial Voice, and then declare, If, howsoe'er by thee preferr'd, my Rival Has in Saguntum's Cause done more than I? Mur. Thou seem'st to vaunt thee in thy martial Deeds: Yet what are these, that any brave Saguntine Should from thy Sword claim but the Second Place In Honour's List? By me Hiempsal fell; Who with bold Feet durst tread the dang'rous Sands, And from the raging Seas snatch back their Spoils. By me fell Chermes, Masulus, and Atyr, Who of his Poyson could disarm the Serpent, And, touching, charm to sleep the baneful Adder. Then Kartalo, that, with intrepid Hand, Would soothing stroke the pregnant Lioness. All Lybian Chiefs, and such their savage Virtues! Nor could, superior to all these, Hiarbas Escape my Sword, tho' sprung from mighty Jove: While now thou gloriest in his Daughter's Chains, In shameful Conquest, ignominious Triumph. Fab. What I have done, becomes not me to say; And with ill Grace thy Tongue declares thy Deeds: Yet tell me, Murrus, did the Shame of Conquest Over an Amazon, whose fatal Arm Had then laid weltring in his Blood thy Brother, Forbid thy Vengeance, and restrain thy Sword? Oh, Honour nicely weigh'd! Fraternal Love! Was it for this the shameful Part was left To me? Who led her Captive from the Field; Which thou disdaining, kept'st thy self aloof. Mur. She saw thee Roman, and she deem'd thee false: Yielding to thee, she hop'd a safer Flight, Which from thy Treach'ry she might soon expect; And that she thought aright, th'Event has prov'd. Fab. How has it prov'd? Is to asperse, to prove? Sad then should be the State of Innocence. Shall bare Assertion have the Force of Truth, And weigh the Tenor of our Actions down? No, 'tis from them, when other Proof is wanting, That Men should form their apt and surer Judgments. Thus therefore wrong'd, let me, not vainly, say, From mine, thy Father thinks me, as I am, Thy Country's Friend, and her no small Support. Mur. Thou her Support! insufferable Pride! Oh Arrogance unmatch'd! What then am I? What is Eurydamas, or Valiant Theron? That we should yield the foremost Rank in War? By Heav'n, my Soul now kindles as for Battel, And my big Heart beats thick with Indignation. No more I charge thee, on thy Life, no more. Fab. I smile, believe me, at this causeless Heat; True Courage is not, where fermenting Spirits Mount in a troubled and unruly Stream; The Soul's its proper Seat; and Reason there Presiding, guides its cool or warmer Motions: Thy idle Rage, that like a cover'd Fire, The Embers rak'd, mounts up in crackling Sparks, I heed no more, than Heav'n those fiery Bubbles. Mur. 'Tis well. Now shew this Grandeur of thy Soul; And let thy Arm, not Words, rebuke that Rage, Which seems so idle to thy reas'ning Valour: Here on this Spot it quickly shall be seen, If thy supporting Sword can save its Master, (Draws.) Fab. Thy Prowess well I know, as thou dost mine; Better employ'd against the common Foe: Then, Murrus, sheath again in Peace thy Weapon; If not for thine, yet for thy Country's Sake. Just would her Exclamations prove on Fabius, If in domestick Broil, howe'er provok'd, My Sword should rob her of so brave a Son. Mur. I soon will ease thee of that needless Fear; Draw; if I fall, my Country shall acquit thee. Fab. Still I am calm. Is not the dear Timandraâ Mur. Her Country's Shame for doating on a Roman; That abject Thought imbitters more my Rage: Nor will I dally thus one Moment longer. Defend thy self.â Fab. âNay, thenâ (Fight.) Enter Eurydamas. Eur. âWhat do I see? If both, or either falls, it suits my Purpose; I will withdraw. Enter Curtius. Cur. âHow now! Retiring, Villain?â 'Tis thou hast blown this Fire; then take thy Share. Enter Theron, as they engage. Ther. I think some Fury has possess'd your Bosoms. Is this a Time for Civil Feud and Discord? [Beats down the Swords of the two latter, while Fabius disarms Murrus. Fab. Now better learn to use thy Tongue or Sword; And owe thy Life, to what thou scorn'st, a Roman. Mur. Curse on my Fate, curse on my feeble Arm, Unfaithful Minister to a daring Soul; Poorly thou hast betray'd my former Name, And in a Moment sully'd all its Glories. Ther. Calm thy self, Murrus; 'tis the Soldier's Lot To meet the Frowns, as well as Smiles of Fortune; In private Combat, as in War, uncertain. Where is the Heroe, who ne'er found his Equal? Or which the Nation, that can boast a Chief, Who still return'd victorious from the Field? Such was not Pyrrhus; such our mighty Foe, Not even Hannibal himself shall prove. What Consolation Fate allows foil'd Virtue, Is to receive that Foil from noble Hands: But what, Eurydamas, shall I say for thee, Thou base Fomenter of unnat'ral Jars? Eur. For meâSpeak for thy self, injurious Priest; Nor blacken others, till thy self art clear: Reform the Manners of thy Libertine Tribe, Cleanse the Augean Stable of thy Breast, Subdue the Hydra Passions of thy Soul, And in these Labours imitate thy God. Ther. When such as thou revile the holy Order, The best of Answers is a noble Scorn. Thus Village Curs howl at the silent Moon, While she serenely glides unclouded on. Enter a Messenger. Mess. The Governor has sent to seek thee, Theron; Our Watchmen from the Towers descry the Foe In Ranks embattel'd, marching towards the City. Ther. Entring, of this I heard; now judge thee, Murrus, Of thy intemp'rate Warmth at such a Juncture: Let this at least unite our Hands and Hearts, And pour redoubled Vengeance on our Foes. [Exeunt Theron, Murrus and Eurydamas. Cur. Why do'st thou loiter thus, my Friend, to arm? Not so was used to be thy martial Ardor. Fab. Is there a Cause? and do'st thou ask it, Curtius? The base Suspicion of my injur'd Virtue, The Rights of War infring'd in my fair Captive, Might well inform thee of my Soul's Resolves. No more my Sword for this Ungrateful People Shall be imbrued in Carthaginian Blood: Let her own Heroes now defend her Walls, And Murrus shew the little Worth of Fabius. Cur. The Thought is just, and worthy of thy self; Then, when they smart, shall they regret thy Wrongs, While the fierce Foe pursues them o'er the Plain, And hangs insulting on their broken Rear: A late, but sure Repentance then shall find them; While from the Battlements thou seest the Rout, Confusion, Horror, and their foul Dismay. Thus wrong'd Pelides, while the Greeks in vain With Pray'rs and Presents would his Aid regain, So fell his Anger, and Revenge so sweet, With gloomy Joy saw Hector fire the Fleet. [Exeunt. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE the Temple. Enter Candace and Lycormas. Can. Much to thy kind Compassion, gentle Priest, Believe me, I am bound: To visit the Distress'd, To calm the Mind, and sooth our anxious Cares, Are Offices that well become thy Function; Wisely for this great End you're set apart, Freed from the Troubles of the busy World, To teach unhappy Mortals to submit To whatsoever the good Gods inflict; And for the pious Deeds Mankind reveres you. Lyc. I'm pleas'd, great Princess, to behold the Storm That rag'd so boysterous in your swelling Breast, Gently subsiding to this Halcyon Calm; Say, is there Ought in which I more may serve you? Can. A lucky Offer;âwell have I dissembled, And hid the wild Disquiet in my Soul. (Aside.) There isâbut what, I fear, thou wilt refuse. Lyc. Command Lycormas, know him for thy Friend. Can. But shall this Friendship reach to bring me Fabius? Ungrateful Fabius, hither to the Temple? Whom spight of all my Wrongs, I still must love. Lyc. From him for Safety wer't thou hither brought, Confided to our Care: Should I abuse The Trust the People have committed to us, My forfeit Head must answer the Offence. Can. Alas, what shall I say? I fear'd thy Answer, Nor have I ought to bribe thee to the Hazard: What can a Captive offer? I swear by Ammon, My great Progenitor, if e'er my Fate Restore me to the Garamantian Throne, I'll give thee a whole Province in Reward. Lyc. A smaller Bribe might purchase what she asks. If Hannibal succeeds without our Aid, Her Interest then may stand me in good stead. (Aside.) Can. He seems to ponder on it, then there's Hope. Lyc. I have consider'd this thy bold Request, Which, at my utmost Peril I shall grant; And in Return will only this demand, That in the Day which Fate seems bringing on, And to the Tyrian's Pow'r shall give the City, Thou wilt not prove unmindful of Lycormas. Can. May Heav'n be so of me, if I forget Thy gen'rous Pity to a wretched Captive: But haste, and bring him to my longing Eyes. Lyc. Do not too soon anticipate the Joy, Which Fate may yet deny thy eager Hopes; Perhaps upon the Field he now lies Dead; For in the Instant thou wert here convey'd, The Foe approaching, all our Forces sally'd, And I am yet to learn of the Event. Can. Forbid it, Heav'n! forbid it ev'ry Power! That should protect a Brave and Godlike Man; For such the scorn'd Candace still must own him. Lyc. Within the Temple, on its utmost Verge, A most recluse and gloomy Cell there lies; To this th'inferior Priests have never Entrance, And only Theron and my self approach it; Thither, if he survive, I will conduct him In my own Robe conceal'd; and freely there Thou may'st disclose whate'er thy Heart shall dictate, But be not long, for in the tedious Minutes, Exquisite Interval, I'm on the Rack; For sure the greatest Evil Man can know, Bears no Proportion to the dread Suspence. Can. To me how transient shall those Minutes prove, Whom Fate allows not ev'n that wretched State! Suspense can only be where Hopes appear, Of those, alas! I've none; then in their Room Let full Despair succeed, and steel my Breast To meet its Fate, that quietly in Death I may lay down the Burden of my Woes. Thus the lost Traveller at Close of Day, Cheerless, thro' Lybia's Wastes, pursues his Way; Dreads the wide Plain, where Trees, nor Hills, arise, A sad Expanse, still lengthning with the Skies! No Land-mark there, no Foot-steps can he trace, Those from th'unfaithful Sands the Winds eraze, And leave, as on the Sea, one undistinguish'd Face. When to his weary Search no End is found, Still in the midst, he throws him on the Ground, There, self-resign'd expects approaching Fate, And deems it Blessings to the former State. [Exit. Lyc. So, she's retir'd; now to perform my Promise. I must go learnâ Enter Eurydamas. âEurydamas return'd! What from the Field? And how have we succeeded? Eur. Our Plots have fail'd, and turn upon our selves: The Roman's Genius has again preserv'd him: But what more grates, th'infatuated People, Whom the fierce Foe pursu'd with dreadful Slaughter Ev'n to the Gates, reproaching now themselves, Impute to Fabius' Absence the Misfortune. Lyc. To Fabius' Absence!âwent he not to Battel? Eur. Fir'd with Disdain at our bold Accusation, Th'Indignity was offer'd to his Name, By forcing from him, in such sort, his Captive, He would not arm, but from the Battlements, A pleas'd Spectator, saw the dismal Havock. Lyc. Thy self an idle one, I may presume, Did'st only make the Semblance of a Fight. Eur. True; and that gave me Leisure to behold The various Chances that attend on War; While Tyrians here, Saguntines there prevail'd, And at a Stay long held the doubtful Battel. Lyc. What gave at last a Fortune to the Day? Eur. The Carthaginian Chief came furious on, And calling loud for Fabius through the Field, Scatter'd Destruction wheresoe'er he pass'd. Unequal to the Shock, our harrass'd Men Gave way, and flying, hardly reach'd the City; Which he had enter'd with them, but for Theron. Lyc. How undesign'dly has he wrought us good? Thou and my self, my Friend, are much his Debtors: But how prevented he the Tyrian's Purpose? Eur. Imagine to thy self a Swarm of Bees Driv'n to their Hive by some impending Storm, Which at its little Port, in clust'ring Heaps, And climbing o'er each other's Back, they enter. Such was the People's Flight, and such their Haste To gain the Gates; not even then secure, So close the Foe pursu'd: 'Twas then that Theron, Advancing singly like another Cocles, Met his full Rage; and from his brawny Arms With Force Herculean hurl'd his knotty Club: Strongly it flew, and on the Tyrian's Armour Horridly clanking, from his Breast rebounded. Him reeling on his Steed his Friends supported, The Priest retreated, and the Gates were clos'd. Lyc. Once, as I think, thou didst reproach Lycormas, As one too lavish in thy Rival's Praise; Now are we quit. Eur. âThe Time indeed requires Our more immediate Thoughts; and tho' we've fail'd, In what, as Earnest of our Truth, was ask'd; Our next Success shall more than compensate. This Night, by Daunus' and Metiscus' Death, Who in the Sally fell, the Gates are mine. This happens cross, as hurrying on our Plot Before the Time concerted with the Tyrian, Yet from our Hands we must not slip th'Occasion; But when the Ev'ning Shades shall spread the Earth, Another perilous Adventure waits thee, By once more seeking the Sidonian Camp. Still it remains to make the Guard our own. Lyc. I have with other Thought, long since, prepar'd, Within my Cell, a Sleep-provoking Draught; So potent in effect, it instant gives Lethargick Rest, and fast binds down the Sense. This, as a Treasure pointed out by Fate For a rich Cordial to thy slender Guard, Worn out by Toils of War, thou may'st dispense, And greedy they shall drink the treach'rous Juice. Then as we shall perceive the Guile take place, We'll give the Signal, and admit the Foe. But I have now t'acquaint thee with a Boon The Captive Queen has begg'd, and I have granted: Here in the Temple would she meet the Roman, And, habited like me, I mean to bring him. Eur. Bold Deed thou hast presum'd to promise, Priest; But what from thence can she, or thou propose? Lyc. I heed not her Design; my own but this, To make her my sure Friend with Hannibal. Eur. Indeed!âbut I may chance to spoil your Plot: This forward Priest encroaches on my Hopes, And from an Emissary grows a Rival. I must at once get rid of him and Murrus, And Fate now throws th'occasion in my way. [Aside. Lyc. What is it, Friend, that thus employs thy Thought? Eur. I have been weighing what thou dost propose, According little to thy wonted Prudence; Great is the Risque, and small, in my Conceit, The Profit rising from that Danger run; For if this Night propitious to us prove, Self-recommended, thoul't not want her Friendship: Yet as thou seem'st to make light of the Hazard, Hear what I offer to thy better Thoughts. In the last Conf'rence with the Tyrian Chief, He then propos'd as our Associate Murrus; Here 'twould be wise to gratify that Wish, And noble Pity to preserve the Youth: For this, in vain, I've us'd my utmost Arts, To all impenetrable he remains; Weak on the Side of Love alone he seems, And, like Achilles, mortal in one Part. Lyc. Proceed; for yet I do not ken thy Aim. Eur. Murrus is still a Stranger to the Flame, Which to thyself the Carthaginian own'd: Him, in the Roman's stead, I would advise To the desiring Queen thou should'st convey. I will prepare him for the Interview, And bid him say his Rival fell in Battel; Then, for thou know'st the Sex that easily pass From one Excess of Passion to another, Should Thought of Liberty, or Love prevail To give him Hopes, she surely makes him ours. Lyc. My aug'ring Soul forbids; yet I consent. Let Murrus come, the Habit shall be ready. [Exit. Eur. There's One o'er-reach'd; the harder Task, I fear, Is yet to come; Murrus, by Nature honest, Perhaps may startle at the Thought of Rape; And, aw'd by Conscience, disappoint my Purpose: But then his Hopes are desp'rate, and his Love Is, like his other Passions, in Excess: On That I build, assist but Fortune here, Down sink my Rivals in the Tyrian's Favour. Murrus, I come; if that thy steady Virtue Escape this Snare, my Wiles know no Resource. [Exit. SCENE changes to the Governor's Palace. Enter Sicoris and Murrus. Sic. No more; but go, and do what I enjoin thee: Submit thee to the Virtue thou hast wrong'd, Make Peace with him, or hope it not with me. Mur. Would then my Father so debase his Son, To have him cringe and fawn upon a Roman? Shall I with servile Looks, and forc'd Obeisance Approach his Pride, and poorly crave his Pardon? Pardon, for what? in what has he been injur'd? And is not yet his Treach'ry manifest? Why, if he meant us well, did he refrain To meet the Tyrian in the bloody Field, But, that his Falshood might not there confront him? Sic. Too well thou know'st the Cause that kept him absent, A just Disdain, and honest Pride of Soul, For which thy Country has severely suffer'd; While, rashly trusting to the noisy Boasts Of talking Warriors, she has lost a Hero. Mur. Patience, good Heav'n, or I shall burst with Rage; My rising Passion quite choaks up my Words: How! talking Warrior! have I liv'd to hear That shameful Title given me by my Father? Sic. I wish I had a better to bestow; Behold yon Plain, see there the recent Dead; Does not that View upbraid thy late Behaviour? These from thy Arm expected their Protection; They fell, but thouâ Mur. I know what you would say, I fled; 'tis true, but yet the last I fled. Sic. Too soon the lastâ Mur. âI am not Hercules; Nor was my Arm indu'd with Power celestial, To conquer Armies, and force Destiny. What was it more I could have done? Sic. âHave died. Mur. I might, indeed; but had my Death avail'd My Country? living, I may do her Service, When better Fortune shall attend our Arms. Sic. Make good thy words; for e'er the setting Sun Shall hide his flaming Chariot in the Main, A last, and desperate Effort we'll try; Now, while the Tyrian, fell'd by Theron's Arm, Has giv'n his Troops to see he can be vanquish'd. If then we meet Repulse, why farewell Hope, And welcome Death: the City's Fate is fix'd. In the mean time, I charge thee, seek out Fabius; Be reconcil'd, or see my Face no more. [Exit. Mur. Then I shall see thy Face no more, stern Man! Injurious Parent! to enjoin a Deed My Soul disdains, and Honour too forbids. Submit! and beg he would be reconcil'd! Hold there, my Heartâno! if he can divest So easily the Sire, I can put off the Son. Enter Eurydamas. Eurydamas, thou'rt come in happy Time To share, and, sharing, to assist my Grief; Grief, did I say?âNow out upon the word: I meant, my Rage; and so I should have call'd it. Eur. His Greeting likes me; the Scene opens well. [Aside. Who is it, Murrus, thus has dar'd to stir thee? Mur. Would I might call him by some other Name, Than that of Father; then should my good Sword Wipe off the foul Aspersions on my Honour. O Friend, had'st thou beheld how I was treated, Reproach'd as faithless, taunted as a Coward! Am I a Coward? Is not my Country's Cause Here at my Heart? Speak, and declare me wrong'd. Eur. Impossible, I think, thy Father thus could act, And, but thou sayst it, 'twould surpass Belief. Mur. Nay more, by Heav'n, he has with Threats enjoyn'd Most vile Submission to the Man I hate, The favour'd Rival of my Fame and Love. But why does that soft Passion now come cross me? Eur. Wherefore, indeed? I could have wish'd the War, With its sad Consequence, thy ruin'd Country, Thy hopeless Flame for an ungrateful Woman, Who, slighting thee, doats on a cursed Roman, Had from thy Bosom driv'n the puny God. Mur. Alas! too strongly has he ta'en Possession Of my weak Breast; which now against my self He fortifies, impregnable to Reason; That, like a Roman, at my utmost Need Forsakes, and poorly yields me to my Foe. Yet would I have thee think it noble Pride, And generous Disdain that urges my Pursuit; I would not ev'n in Love know a Superior, But, as in War, surmount all Opposition. Eur. Then thou shouldst act the prudent Warrior's Part, Not fondly grasp at things impossible; For little less than such are thy vain Hopes: Suppose, which yet we know is far from Truth, Her Heart estrang'd from Fabius, can you think, Those Arms, imbru'd in her lov'd Father's Blood, Shall ever clasp her in the Folds of Love? Mur. Thou seest, for her I have forgot my Brother; Beneath her biting Ax fell the unhappy Youth. Eur. And shall their Blood cement your growing Friendship, Inspire soft Love, and kindle am'rous Flames? Shocking to Thought! no, tis too sure this way Thou never canst succeed:âand yet there isâ Mur. Another, thou wouldst say: my more than Friend, My better Genius. Eur. âMost true there is; butâ Mur. Why dost thou hesitate, and bar my Joy? Eur. First it behoves thee, Murrus, well to weigh Our lost Condition, and the City's State; Not many Suns can we sustain the Siege, And the surviving Few shall then be Slaves; 'Mongst those my Name shall never be enroll'd. Mur. I need not say my Soul too scorns the Thought. Eur. What hinders, but that thou shouldst seize thy Bliss, And, in a lucky Hour, forestall thy Fate? The means are in my Hands, embrace th'Occasion. Mur. Thou wouldst not have me ravish! Eur. Canst thou think An Amazon is won by whining Courtship, Or that she ever shall complain of Force? The bold impetuous Warrior still they chuse, In strict Embraces strain the struggling Youth, Who, nobly daring, gratefully offends, And spares their Cheek the Blush of dull Consent. Mur. My Soul is stagger'd at the horrid Deed. Eur. Why then let Fabius go; for e'er an Hour Be past, disguis'd he meets her in the Temple; For what, I leave to thy Imagination; But sure, I think, they mean not cool Discourse: Yet had it pleas'd thee, thou hadst fill'd his Place. Mur. Ha! thou hast rous'd all that is Man within me; The thought of Rivalship has fir'd my Blood: Shall Fabius revel in extatick Joys, And in her Arms, once more with Pride elate, Insult, with double Triumph, wretched Murrus? Remorse, be gone; avaunt, thou Bugbear, Conscience. Did now the City blaze with Tyrian Flames, And the lost Firebrands cast their dreadful Gleam, In streaming Fires around the sacred Fane, Shrieking, and clinging to the Shrine, I'd force her, Another Semele enjoy'd in Flames. Yet could I wish, so much I love the Fair, To different Fates the ancient Tale were turn'd, The Nymph might be preserv'd, the Lover burn'd. [Exeunt. Enter Sicoris, Theron and Timandra. Sic. I have already charg'd thy haughty Brother, T'implore his Pardon, and confess him injur'd; Go thou, and with Love's powerful Rhet'rick strive T'inforce the Plea, and win him to our Aid. Ther. The Task is only thine, thou charming Maid; Alone thou know'st the Workings of his Soul, Its secret Avenues and softer Moments. Sic. Think what a noble Cause employs thy Tongue, Thy ancient Father, and thy mourning Country, And both their Blessings shall attend thy Suit. Tim. Oh, with what Joy I readily accept, With how much Pleasure shall perform the Task, With how great Rapture, if Success should crown it! And is there ought he shall refuse Timandra? I go, I fly, nor will I quit my Heroe, Till Love shall send him dreadful to the Field. [Exit. Sic. Hast Thou, as we agreed, employ'd the Priests, To learn the People's utmost Resolution, To try their strength of Soul, and know, if now The Gods prove adverse to our last Attempt, And Hope be lost, they dare to plunge in Flames, And, self devoting, disappoint their Foes? Ther. I have my self been talking with their Chiefs; Not one of all averse to the Design, So firm their Love of Liberty, and Faith: The noble Warmth inspires the very Matrons, Who dancing in their Arms their famish'd Babes, Cry, hush! my Boy, an end of Woes is nigh: And since it was not giv'n thy infant Arm, To fight thy Country's Battles, perish with her. Sic. Then all is well; at least, in our sad State: Then let the barbarous Foe insult our Walls, The naked Ruins where Saguntum stood. Our freeborn Sons in Freedom shall expire; Visit th'Elysian Fields, all true, all brave, And not a single Soul descend the Shades a Slave. [Exeunt. Enter Fabius and Timandra. Fab. Cease to request that which I dare not grant, What rigid Honour to my Will denies: Wouldst thou of that lov'd Equal with thy self His other Consolation, rob thy Fabius? Tim. What is this Idol Honour, that exacts Such horrid Worship, and such cruel Rites? Can nought less than a Peoples Blood atone A single Violation of her Law? Fab. Sacred they are, and by the great and brave Beheld at Distance with Religious Awe, Nor, when invaded by the profane Vulgar, Demand a slight and petty Reparation. Tim. Yet Heav'n it self is mov'd by Penitence, And the red Bolt, brandish'd aloft in Air, Is wrested from the ready Arm of Jove; Who, in Compassion to our frailer Nature, Oft suffers seeming Violence from Pray'r: And dost thou boast his Lineage, yet put off That gentle Virtue, in which he delights? Fab. Thou talkst as if I were indeed a God, And Fate depended upon my Volition. Tim. Alas! I find thee mortal by thy Passions, Resenting, wrathful, and inexorable, Yet once I ne'er could thus have thought of Fabius. Fab. My Heart is riven asunder by thy Words; Take here my Sword, rip up my Bosom quick; See there the Pow'r thou hast to be obey'd In any Thing but this. Tim. âTis this alone Shall give the Proof, and evidence thy Love. This if thou canst refuse, thou dost abandon The lost Timandra to some Ruffian's Arms; Who then, as now, with streaming Eyes, in vain, Shall deprecate the fierce Barbarian's Rage. Fab. The Thought is terrible; thou hast o'ercome; I go, but first permit this last Embrace: Did not Persuasion hang upon thy Tongue, Did not thy Words thus soft, and mournful flow, Who could resist those moving, speaking Drops, That sparkle in thy Eyes with trembling Lustre? Thus when her Son on Phrygian Plains lay dead, In humid Clouds Aurora veil'd her Head; Her rosy Cheeks thro' the dim Crystal glow With fainter Colours, and confess her Woe; Sadly her radiant Eyes the Tears adorn, Yet in the fragrant Dew more sweetly rose the Morn. [Exit. Tim. And now, methinks, I tremble at my Conquest; Tumultuous Fears run shiv'ring through my Limbs: Alas! to what a dreadful Field I've sent him? And, if he falls, I loseâgood Gods! what shall I lose? The bravest Man, and most sincere of Lovers. Fatal his Sword in Battle to his Foes, Dreadful his Wrath, while the shrill Trumpet sounds: But when the charming Youth divests the Warriour, And fierce Bellona yields him up to Venus, With what bewitching Softness does he look! With what endearing Tenderness he talks! The artless Tale of Love, that from his Lips Flows in soft Murmurs, like a limpid Stream, Attracts my whole Attention, and my Love. While Philomela thus her Strains renews, Deep in the shady Covert, cloath'd in Dews; The soft melodious Notes, that charm the Heart, Approach Perfection, as they mock all Art. [Exit. The End of the fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE the TEMPLE. Enter Lycormas. Lyc. Oh, horrid Deed! what have my Eyes beheld? Deceiv'd Eurydamas, and Villain Murrus! Oh! I could tear my Flesh, and curse my Folly, Thus to be ruin'd by a lustful Boy: Capricious State of all Conspiracies! Where build we e'er so wisely or so strong, Founded on Reason, rais'd with utmost Caution; Some unthought Accident, and least suspected, Throws to the Ground the goodly rising Fabrick. What's to be done? Can I approach the Tyrian, And hope his Favour for a ravish'd Mistress? Not this I promis'd, nor will he reward. Enter Eurydamas unseen. Shall it avail me to declare the Truth? Will it not more inflame his Rage against me? False both to him and her, a double Traitor. Eur. These Looks disorder'd, and uneasy Gestures, Sufficiently declare his secret Anguish; The Disappointment that now tears his Heart. Lyc. The more I think, the more I'm lost: Eurydamas! How dearly thy too subtle Schemes shall cost us? Eur. Thy self I hope, not me; mistaken Priest! But let me now resume the Hypocrite, And stand aghast at Mischiefs I contriv'd. [Shews himself. I come not now, Lycormas, to relate The bloody Deeds that in an Hour have past; Suffice it, both Sides are with Loss retir'd; But, as the Gloom of Night comes on, would warn thee To hasten thy Departure to their Camp. Lyc. But tell me first, how fares our new Associate, The late admitted, but well-trusted Murrus? Eur. How little does he think, he ne'er was trusted? [Aside. The Youth is dead; but wherefore these thy Titles? Lyc. Yet more, how fell he? Eur. âBy the Tyrian's Arm. Lyc. Oh, Heav'n! how just, how righteous are thy Dooms! Eur. What mean thy Words? in what has Heav'n been just? Lyc. Alas! Eurydamas, we are undone! Our Hopes all ruin'd by one Act of Murrus. When, as abrupt with striding Hast he left The Temple, flush'd and ruffled much he seem'd, Which I misconstrued, from his well known Warmth, The quick Resentment of a cold Reception: But how was I deceiv'd? for as I walk'd, Musing how best to her I might excuse An honest Fraud, that tended but to save A gallant Man, and give him to the Side Of Carthage, in her future Wars a Heroe: Thro' the long Isle came wafted to my Ear A hollow Murmur, and imperfect Sound; Which, drawing nearer, I perceiv'd were Groans, Mingled with Plaints, and issuing from the Cell, Which I had nam'd their fatal Place of meeting. Eur. Thy Tale's Beginning bodes disastrous End. Lyc. I entred softly; when, Oh piteous Sight! With Hair dishevel'd, prostrate on the Pavement Lay the sad Queen; I gently would have rais'd her, When she with Looks, that spoke at once Disdain, Despair and Anguish, Indignation, Shame, And art thou come, Perfidious! to insult me? And does thy sacred Robe conceal a Pander? Pander to Rape, and horrid Violation! 'Tis well thou seest me destitute of Weapon; Well for the Ravisher I was disarm'd; But fly, be gone, and leave me to Despair: Struck mute with Horror, I obey'd and left her. Eur. Dreadful, indeed, seems the Catastrophe Of this thy Story, which I well perceive Has made too deep Impression on thy Soul, Nor is our State so desp'rate as thou think'st. Lyc. Explain thy self, expound the dark Enigma. Eur. These are not Hours for Pity and Remorse; To make This safe, we must do greater Ills: Now hear what I unfold, and know 'twas I Put Murrus on the Deed, thou call'st our Ruin. Lyc. Impossible! certain, my Ears abuse me. Eur. Again I say, 'twas I; and these my Reasons. When first I tamper'd with the haughty Youth, Stern and averse to our Design I found him; At length o'ercome by subtle Arguments, Urg'd with Success, and tedious now to mention, On one Condition he vouchsaf'd his Friendship: And what was that, forsooth, but sole Dominion, The Government entire without an Equal? And this too by the Tyrian must be promis'd; If not, he strait accus'd us to his Father: Thus plung'd, I seem'd to yield; then wrought him up, By Tales replete of jealous Circumstance, To act a Crime I knew must be his Ruin. Lyc. How frail are all Confed'racies in Vice! Where each at Heart has but his proper Good; This granted, still the Priesthood had been mine. [Aside. Yet wherefore went he to the Field? when there, Why did he not, like thee, keep free of Danger? Eur. The Question puzzles me:âyet now I have it. [Aside. The first was unavoidable, the last Occasion'd by the stinging Taunts of Fabius; Who loudly calling to keep Pace with him, The fiery Youth sprung thoughtless on his Fate. But to our Purpose; from dead Murrus' Lips Comes no Discov'ry; and it will beseem Thy Care, to see her Tongue may tell no Tales. Lyc. Shall she conceal th'Abettor of her Rape? For such, besure, she thinks me. Eur. âSee'st thou this? (Offers him a Dagger. Lyc. 'Tis Theron's Dagger.â Eur. âIn the Field he dropt it; Take, plunge it in her Heart, then cast it by her; At his Proposal was she hither brought; That Circumstance with this, as I'll improve it, Shall make the Deed seem his; there's home Revenge: This done, securely thou may'st greet the Tyrian; To whom, whene'er I please, I can unriddle. [Aside. Lyc. Oh! horrid, monstrous Villany! my Soul Shrinks inward at the complicated Crimes: But can'st thou think, I will commit this Murder? Eur. I leave it to thyself, I am untouch'd In this Affair, she cannot me accuse. Lyc. By Hercules, she shall; have I been made Thy Property, the Tool of thy Ambition? Remorse and Vengeance both have seiz'd my Soul: I will this Moment to the Governor, To him declare the utmost that I know, And by my Penitence deserve my Pardon. Eur. Thou canst not mean it? Lyc. âThat thou shalt soon perceive. Eur. Curse on the puny Traitor, half-strain'd Villain! [Aside. Wilt thou, in Rashness, thus at once destroy What we've with Care and immense Hazard brought Just to a Crisis, and mature for Birth? Lyc. Thou talk'st to Stones; I am determin'd, see. [Going. Eur. Yet let me stay thee. (holding him.) Lyc. â'Tis in vain; what, Ho!â My Brethren, Brethren, Murder! Eur. âThou do'st well, Thus to instruct me; take with thee that and that,â (Stabs him. This too were right. (As he goes to stab himself, enter Priests, who seize and prevent him. Lyc. Secure the horrid Villain; Secure him from himself; that Death's too light For Crimes like his: Convey me to my Cell; Fly Some with your best Speed, and find out Theron; To him, if my Breath lasts, I will unfold A Tale that shall inflame and freeze his Blood. [Exit, carry'd by Priests. SCENE changes to the Governor's Palace. Enter Sicoris and Timandra. Sic. Vain our Endeavours, vain is all Defence, 'Tis Opposition to the Will of Heav'n; The partial Fates have doom'd Saguntum's Walls, And Hercules himself cannot protect His City; down then level with the Earth, Sink, noble Piles, so that in Fame you rise More great by Fall, ennobled by your Ruin: But, Oh, my Child! when I behold thy Tears, The Liv'ry of thy softer Sex's Nature, My Soul too softens, and I catch thy Fears. Tim. Alas! my Father, for myself alone Flow not the first, nor do the latter chill My Heart; while I behold you safe, I fear, I tremble for my Brother; and whom more, Forgive me Modesty, I love, for Fabius: If Murrus fall, I should bewail his Fate; If Fabius, I shall be his Murderer. Sic. Should Fate determine thus, yet were their Wounds Glorious; in such a Cause well would they die; Thus, had their Years been mine, would I have fall'n; Nor, like a doddard Oak with sapless Arms Expos'd to Winds, have waited the slow Ax. Then dry thy Tears, and imitate thy Mother, A Heroine, she still arm'd me for the Fight. Tim. But had my Mother by Love's pow'rful Ties Won you to arm, and urg'd you to the Field; What would have been (had she, what I have, seen) Her Dread of Soul, and agonizing Fears? But she's at Peace, and hapless I survive To know the Loss of Lover, Father, Country. Sic. Prepare thy Breast then to sustain the Shock For see! the Messenger of Fate approaches. Enter Theron. Thy Looks do more than speak;âmy Son is dead. Oh, pow'rful Nature! Manhood, by thy Leave: While to his Shade I pay this small Oblation. [Weeps. Ther. His Foes already have perform'd that Office, And from their mangled Limbs wept purple Streams. Sent to the gloomy Fields of Stygian Jove, They grin, and flit before his dreaded Shade. Tim. And art thou fall'n, dear Youth? and am I left, The last short Comfort of my Father's Age? Poor, good old Man! how are thy pious Cares, That form'd in Virtue's School two noble Sons, To full Maturity of Worth and Honour, Thus disappointed by the cruel War? Who shall supply their Offices of Duty? Who from the Foe guard thy defenceless Years? There is but One;âperhaps, that One is not; I dread, and yet must know: resolve me, Theron; Speak, for thou know'st, that which I dare not ask. Ther. I understand thy Meaning; Fabius lives. Tim. Now Blessings on thy Tongue! but say, where is he? Why comes he not? Ther. âToo soon he will be here, A Sight of Horror to thy wounded Eyes; Yet such was his Desire, that on thy Bosom He might pour out his Soul, and sink to Rest. Tim. Cover me, Hills! ye Mountains, with your Groves, Come, pitying, shadow me with sudden Night! Oh! hide me from his Sight; deep at your Roots Beneath the dusky Gloom o'erwhelm Timandra. In the dark Caverns let me yell my Griefs, Nor with my Shrieks disturb his parting Soul. Sic. I feel new Grief; another Son I mourn. Ther. Thy Son, indeed, I think; and sure he fought, As if to Murrus he was more than Brother; Nor was the Youth in Bravery behind him, Or Race of Glory e'er more nobly run. Tim. Oh, pompous Circumstance of fatal Woe! Sic. Ah, happy Youths, how glorious are ye fall'n! Ther. As when two able Mowers ready stand Both at the Ends of their appointed Furrows, With Emulation fir'd, each lusty Swain Advances on his Side; in Heaps the Corn Falls from the sweeping Scythes, and spreads the Land. So fell the Tyrians, so with equal Steps Did they push on, and gain upon their Foes; At length, with horrid Strides, Marmarick Othrys, Of Size enormous, and Gigantick Limbs, Stalk'd forth their Ranks, and with his thund'ring Arm Fell'd on his Knees thy Son; the Monster stoop'd To pierce his Breast, when with a noble Blow The Roman sever'd from the Trunk his Head. Sic. It was a Godlike Deed, and well became The brave Descendant of great Hercules. Ther. It now was Murrus' Turn; when fierce Acerras, Leader of their unbridled Horse, came on, And, wheeling round with oblique Force, at once O'er-run the Roman with his furious Steed; Full at the Courser's Temples Murrus threw A whirling Lance, that pierc'd through either Ear; Mad with the Pain, in Air aloft he rear'd, Then, floundring back, crush'd with his Weight the Rider. Sic. It joys my Soul, to hear my Son repaid The Debt of Honour. Tim. âBut, alas! in vain. Ther. The Gods would have it so; their Fate was nigh, For Hannibal, enrag'd, himself advanc'd On Murrus, whom with his protended Spear He struck to Earth, never again to rise. This Fabius saw, and with indignant Rage Cry'd, For Reward take this, curst Carthaginian; With Might collected toss'd he then his Lance; It flew, it reach'd his Thigh, and, quiv'ring there, Drank deep the Blood; his Squadrons straight pour'd in, When Fabius soon appear'd all o'er one Wound; Curtius and I rush'd forward to his Rescue, Which, obstinate to win, or die, we forc'd; Then, whilst we made a slow retreating Fight, Our Men bore from the Field the dying Hero. Enter a Priest, and whispers Theron. How! in the Temple stab'd? I follow thee. [Exit Priest. Enter Curtius, Fabius brought in by Soldiers. But, lo! what of itself might drive me hence. [Exit. [Timandra runs towards Fabius, but stops short. Tim. Oh, Fabius! oh, my Love! oh Horror! Horror! Oh, Gorgon Sight, that turns me to a Stone! My Blood congeals, and ev'ry stiff'ning Joint Loses its Sense, and ministerial Function; Fix'd to the Earth, like Niobe, I stand A Monument of Woe, a breathing Statue. Fab. Once more, Timandra, am I blest to see thee, To take a sad Farewell, and breath my last. Tim. Oh, how shall I approach thee, Fabius! how, Behold thy swimming Eyes that roll in Death! Do not thy discontinuous Wounds reproach, And keep at awful Distance, lost Timandra? Else would I clasp thee bleeding as thou art, And give a Loose to Love, and wild Despair. Fab. Lost be that Thought! thou wer't but Fate's kind Agent To clear my Fame, and wake my nodding Virtue; And Heav'n can witness, I alone in Death Regret, that for thy Safety I'm no more. Tim. Forbear this Tenderness; oh, cease to be Thus wondrous kind, thus exquisitely good! Thy Generosity but more distracts me, And sinks me lower with oppressive Grief. Shall then my Safety be thy latest Care? Oh, spare thee that Concern! 'tis needless all. When thou art gone, Despair will soon point out The Means of Safety, and a Place of Rest. Fal. Expect, I charge thee, Heav'n's appointed Time; And sure, I think, thou hast not long to wait; Then shall thy Soul unspotted reach the Plains, Where the blest Shades enjoy their well-earn'd Bliss; There on the Borders will I wait thy Coming, And hail thee first from Charon's sluggish Boat; Thence lead to secret Groves, where faithful Lovers Meet their Reward in never-ending Joys. Draw near, old Man, I would have call'd thee Father; Yet, e'er I die, receive me as thy Son. [To Sicoris. Curtius, I go, now take me to thy Arms; For mine, alas! cannot infold my Friend: Remember well thy Promise, 'tis to live, And, while the Fates permit, defend Timandra. To you, oh Gods! that from my Country's Name This foul Dishonour may be wash'd away, Is Fabius's last Pray'r. [Dies. Tim. Alas! he's gone! His Heart forgets to beat, his Eyes to move, While mine are dry with Grief and stupid Sorrow; Burst, burst, my Heart! 'tis that alone can ease thee. [Swoons, and is carry'd off. Sic. To her Apartment bear the mourning Maid. Cur. He had my Promise, Sicoris, which I'll keep: For, but to guard thy Daughter, Curtius lives. Sic. Short then shall be thy Care, and Stay behind him; For know, this Night, the People are determin'd, Firing the Town, to lay themselves in Ashes; To-morrow's rising Sun shall see the Tow'rs, He us'd to gild, lie smoaking on the Ground. Cur. Amazing, but most glorious Resolution! Sic. Convey thou to the Temple thy dead Friend; There I and Theron, with our chief Saguntines, Beneath the sacred Roof design to fall. Cur. Take up the ill-star'd Hero; greatly now Shall his illustrious Shade descend, while Fame rewards His ev'ry noble Action, martial Toil: And a whole City is his Fun'ral Pile. [Exit with the Body. Sic. Now to my Child; yet oh! how shall I break To such a tender Heart our dreadful Purpose? But Fate, I hope, has arm'd her for the Blow. As he goes out, enter a Priest to him. Priest. Theron requires thy Presence at the Temple, And bids me say, Treason thy Sentence waits. Sic. How, Treason, say'st thou! sure that comes too late! But my own Cares must to the publick yield. [Exit with the Priest. SCENE changes to the Forum. Enter an Under-Priest and Saguntines. Prie. Hither I've call'd you to see Justice done; He, who before abus'd your credulous Ears, Would, on this Night, have giv'n you up to Ruin. 1st Sag. Oh, Crime unparallel'd! 2d Sag. âOh, horrid Monster! 3d Sag. We'll rend him Limb from Limb, and each Saguntine In his torn Carcass glut their great Revenge. Enter Curtius with the Body of Fabius. Cur. See there, Saguntines! see the Traitor Fabius, Him, whom your mean Suspicions basely wrong'd: Behold his num'rous Wounds, and then, perforce, You must confess there was One noble Roman. 1st Sag. Asham'd, we own his Worth, thine too we know. 2d Sag. Oh, had thy Country lent us but her Aid! 3d Sag. And sure we well deserv'd it at her Hands! Cur. Their brave Reproaches sting me to the Soul. [Aside. Enter from the Temple Sicoris with Eurydamas bound. Sic. Oh thou, for whom my Tongue can find no Name! Say, what could move thee to such monstrous Crimes? To wanton Villanies, luxuriant Evils! Was not thy Country's Ruin ample Mischief? But that with cursed Arts thou shouldst seduce Thy near related Friend, train'd up in Virtue, To perpetrate a Deed, must shock his Nature. Eur. For That, perhaps, I had a secret Reason; But trouble me no more with idle Questions; I'm in thy Pow'r, and I expect my Fate: Yet there, at least, my Plots have answer'd well. [pointing to the Body. Cur. Oh, execrable Villain! dost thou boast A Plot too in his Death! Oh, set him free, Saguntines! Sicoris, give him to my Sword. Sic. Suppress thy Rage; that were to make his Death Noble, not ignominious as he merits. Hence, drag him to the Tow'r o'erlooks the Gate, Which his perfidious Hands should have unbarr'd; There give th'appointed Signal, and when they, Elate with Hope, and eager Expectation Of well-concerted Fraud, and Tyrian Guile, Approach our Walls, and think the City theirs, Hurl him precipitated on their Heads; Now let them learn Saguntum's steady Justice, Her Patience, Fortitude, and unexampled Bravery, Her more than human Constancy to Friends: For us, my Countrymen, we may with Pride exult, (The Partner of his Crime, tho' late, repenting,) One single Traitor did these Walls contain, And him our just Revenge has found; nor shall His caitiff Dust, in the last glorious Scene, Which, big with Horror, Fate now opens on us, Mingling with ours, pollute the honest Heap. Eur. How I contemn the Death, to which I go! Thy little Malice, and this wise Harangue! A single Traitor, saidst thou! single Patriot! Who would from Ruin have preserv'd his Country. Farewel, ye virtuous Ideots! in Reward Of all your Suff'rings, let the Romans say, The faithful Fools deserv'd a better Fate. [is carry'd off. Sic. To his own Home, now ev'ry one repair, Take from his Family a last Embrace, Invoke the Gods, then set it in a Blaze. 1 Sag. We are prepar'd. Omn. âOh, Governor, farewel. [Exeunt Sag. Sic. Now, Hercules, look down, and own a People, That, in their noble Deaths, have thee in View. Enter Theron, leading Candace. Exchange Forgiveness with me, injur'd Queen; Fatal t'each other have our Houses prov'd: Pity a Father, that's oblig'd to mourn A Son's most horrid Action, not his Death: What only Reparation I can offer, Is Liberty; this Moment thou art free; Without our Walls thou shalt be safe conducted. Can. My Soul disdains it: Shall the stain'd Candace Bear Violation to her Friends, and o'er Her warlike Maids reign their polluted Queen? Forbid it, Modesty! forbid it, Jove, My glorious Ancestor! That, too, forbids, [pointing to the Body. That dismal Spectacle: Oh, cruel Youth! How wan! how cold! still wer't thou so to me: This shall be kinder than its Master was, And give me Peace. Now, gracious Ammon, take Thy injur'd Daughter, and avenge her Wrongs. [Snatches the Sword of Fabius, stabs herself, and falls. Curt. There fled her furious Soul. Ther. It was well aim'd, Home to the Heart, a sure, and speeding Blow. Sic. Take up the Bodies, bear them to the Temple. [They are carry'd off. Enter an Attendant of Timandra. Attend. Ah! Sir, your Daughter, seiz'd by sudden Madness, Broke from the Arms of her attending Virgins, And rushing from the Palace, as she past, From a Saguntine Hand, prepar'd for Ruin, She snatch'd a flaming Torch, and hither bends. Enter Timandra distracted, with a Torch in her Hand. Tim. Where, where's the Bridegroom? where is the dear Man? Speak, thou his Friend, for I am come to claim him. My Father here! O sacred Sir! your Blessing; These are my Nuptials, This the Torch of Hymen. The Temple open! then he waits me there. Cur. He does, indeed!âbut dead. Tim. Why then I'll fire The lofty Pile, and make it his vast Urn; So gently creeping steal me to his Side, And mount together in the glorious Flames. [Exit running into the Temple. Sic. Alas! poor Girl! the Gods I think inspire, In soft Compassion to thee, this kind Frenzy. Now, Theron, let's embrace; thy Arm too, Roman; [to Curt. Once more: 'tis well; proceed we to the Temple. Ther. Yet hold!âwhat's This that starts and bounds within me? That tears, and struggling thus dilates my Breast? 'Tis Inspiration! 'tis our glorious God! That deigns this Honour to his dying Servant; Who, with my Bosom, has enlarg'd my Mind, And gives me now to see into hereafter: And thus the Prospect stands;âBehold! Behold! From these sad Ruins, flaming to the Skies, A new Saguntum, PhÅnix like, arise; Her Sons, like us, shall Liberty maintain, And in their Faith inviolate Remain: But when as circling Years have roll'd their Round, O'er various Realms shall Tyranny abound; A mighty Nation then shall Heav'n ordain To curb th'Oppressor, and to break his Chain; A gen'rous People, that delight to save, Pleas'd from the Tyrant to set free the Slave, Polite as Romans, and as Romans brave. Hail, glorious Warriours! wellcome to our Shore; With Joy I hear your future Engines roar; With these combin'd shall mighty Deeds be done, I see Iberia's Empire soon o'errun: But, ah! what Star malign would shew its Face? Shall the same Fortune still attend our Race? 'Tis past: a sickning Cloud obscures the Rest, And the relenting God forsakes my tortur'd Breast. Sic. Whate'er it be thy mystick Words imply, If plung'd by Fate these sad Extremes we try, And constant in our Leagues, and Liberty we die; Saguntum's gen'rous Fires shall blaze with Fame, And late Posterity record her Name. Curtain falls. The END.</field>
