      <field name="fulltext">HECTOR, A Tragic Cento.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Chalcas, a Greek priest. Achilles, a warrior. Agamemnon, general of the Grecian forces. Hector, general of the Trojan forces. Paris, brother to Hector. Priam, king of Troy. Ulysses, a warrior. Patroclus, the friend of Achilles. Antilochus, a Grecian Andromache, the wife of Hector. Helen, the mistress of Paris.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Tent of Agamemnon. The Grecian Princes assembled. Chal. Noble Achilles, then if thou would'st know What moves the arrow-darting PhÅbus' rage, Swear to protect me by thy power and sword, For I our mightiest chieftain must accuse, And truths reveal, offensive to the great. Ach. What Heaven has told thee, tell us undismay'd! No! By the ever-glorious God thou serv'st, And whose prophetic oracle thou art, While light is dear to me, and life enjoy'd, No hand profane shall touch thy sacred head, Not e'en the sovereign whom we all obey, Shall Agamemnon dare to do thee wrong! Chal. 'Tis he himself who has incens'd the Godâ The priest of PhÅbus came with costly gifts, An ample ransom for his captive child, And on the shore to all the host of Greece, That stood consenting, he addressed his prayer. But Agamemnon, with disdainful pride, The gifts rejected, and the pray'r contemn'd. For this, the father to his God complain'dâ For this, the God indignant bent his bow, Nor will relent, till to her father's arms Ye send ChryseÃ¯sâand with sacrifice Implore Apollo, and atone the sin. Agam. Prophet of mischief! Ever such to meâ Must now the Greeks by thy malignant tongue Be lectured to rebel?âBe taught, that I Incensed the God, that I brought down the plague Which slays the innocentâbecause I prize The gentle captive more than paltry gold? But if 'tis meet that she should go, I yieldâ Perish myselfâif for the common good. Yes, let her go!ârevoke the gift ye gave, O it is just the generous Greeks should tell That Agamemnon unrewarded bled! Ach. Supreme in grandeur and renown, and greed, How shall the army gratify thee now? We shar'd impartially our hard-won spoilâ Would'st thou oblige us to refund for thee Our several portions? Call on all our menâ On all the Greeks to form the stock anew For thee again to share?âThis would be wise! But send the damsel home, and when great Jove Makes towered Ilion's hoarded heaps our own, Threefold o'er all shall be thy rich reward. Agam. God as thou count'st thyself amidst the fight, Art thou in council so surpassing too That I defrauded must confess thy skill? Before that I resign my beauteous prize Produce the just equivalent, and wellâ But if ye rob me, and deny my due, I will exert the greatness of my power, And from the prizes others safe enjoy, Indemnity acquire. Ulysses, your's; Or your's, brave Ajax; ah! Achilles, chafe! Thine own perhaps may first appease my claim! Ach. Inglorious man!âBut in assurance great! What Greek again at thy command will watch In secret ambush, or in battle fight? What cause had I to war for thee or thine? Troy wrong'd not meânor ever Trojan drove My steeds or oxen, nor within my land Left print of hostile tread! Far, far, from hence, Fenced by the sea and vale-o'ershadowing hills, My coursers fed, and affluent harvests blest The peaceful labors of my joyous swains. Hither, thou front of hollow heartless brass, We cheerful cameâcame, when implored by thee, T'avenge a private, not a public wrong, Thine and thy brother's cause. The recompenceâ Disgrace and insult! What, and dar'st thou threat To seize my prize, so hard, so dearly won? A prize, O tyrant! match'd with thine, as small As thy atchievements, when compared with mine; Wealth in each conquest ever is thy share, But mine is toil and danger. Despot! know, Achilles is thy ready slave no more, And soon my fleet shall bear me swiftly home. Agam. Haste, spread thy sails! away, with speed, away! I woo thee not to linger. Fly, begone! Thy transient friendship, and thy groundless hate, To me are equal. Tyrannize at home, But here, 'tis mine to lord and thine to serve. Go, get ye home. There is not in the camp King or commander whom I hate as thee. Back to her sire, my bark shall bear the maidâ But then prepare, imperious prince, prepare To yield thy captive tooâshe shall be mine, Even in thy tent, yea, at thy side I'll seize her; So shalt thou rue the madness of that hour, In which thou dared'st imperial might, and all Our host shall know, and tremble while they learn, That Kings are subject to the Gods alone. Ach. Thou dog at baying, though in heart a deer, When wast thou known to brave the ambush'd foe, Or dare the front of war? Thou scourge of Jove, Sent in his anger on a slavish raceâ By this, this sacred sceptre that thou seest In my right hand, as severed from the tree, Its parent on the mountain top, as I Shall henceforth be from thee and thine, This sceptre, emblem of the power conferr'd By Jove on Kingsâa dreadful oath I swear; When Greece again shall ask Achilles' aid In vain shall she implore!âWhen Hector comes Bloody and grim, fierce trampling to the shore O'er mountains of the deadâthen shalt thou mourn, And rage in bitterness of soul to think, How thou hast scorn'd, as he were like thyself, AchillesâIâthe bulwark of your cause. SCENE II. A Chamber. Hector, Paris, and Helen. Hec. Infatuated man! by woman's smiles Spell-bound to thy destruction. Hadst thou died At thy ill-starr'd nativity, or death Prohibited thy fatal nuptial rites, What shame hadst thou escaped, and Troy what woe! Couldst thou along the proudly swelling waves, Thy breast more haughty, in thy stately ships Courageous seek the beauteous Spartan bride, And bear her willing from her lord away; Yet basely here in slack seclusion lurk, Shrunk from thy country's foes, friends but for thee? Disastrous recreant! thy father's shame! Is this a time for such soft dalliance? For thee, for thine, the sons of Ilion fall, Till but the high-heap'd corses of the dead Alone protect the town. For thee, for thine, Around the war a narrowing circle burns, The soldiers perish, and the widows cry! Closer and closer nears the wasteful fire, And thou sitt'st safe regardless. Up and forth, Or here with Troy be sheeted in the flames. Par. These just reproaches, Hector, I deserveâ O who can boast thy firmly temper'd mind, Prepared for every accident of fate, Like the keen hatchet in the shipwright's hand, Still edged for use, and still untired by toil. Now shrinking from th'indignant public eye, I sat lamenting my unhappy doom; But roused by thee, my honor wakes again, And beauteous Helen urges me to arm. Conquest to-day may yet redeem my fameâ To dare is man's, the victory is Heav'n's! Stay patient here, till I my armour brace, Or go, and emulous, I'll soon be there. [Exit Paris. Helen. O brother of a sister, self-abhorred, And by all hearts for ills that I have caus'd! But here some short respite from labor take: Alas, no breast endures such pain as thine! For Paris' guilt, and worthless Helen's crime, The Gods ordain our miserable fate, Present distress and infamy to come, The direful themes of everlasting song. Hect. I must not rest, fair Helen; other friends Claim sad endearments ere I seek the field. But urge the loiterer, let him not delay To join me ere again I quit the town. [Exit Hector. Hel. Oh! that the winds had seiz'd me at my birth, Borne me to wilds, the famish'd eagles' prey! Or, plung'd me deep in death beneath the waves, Before the vengeance of this direful war Had thus devouring rag'd around for me. [Exit. SCENE III. A Street in Troy near the ScÃ¦an Gate. Hector and Andromache, with the Nurse and Child. And. Impetuous prince, O whither dost thou run, Thy wife forgetting and thy helpless child? O sure such courage but provokes thy doom, And Greece with all her heroes closing round Will overwhelm thee, and thou must be lost. Earth yield me ere that fatal hour a tomb, For then no other refuge will be mine! No mother now remains to soothe my woe, Nor sire to shield, nor brother to protect; Yet in thee, Hector, I possess them all. But father, mother, brethren lost again I must deplore, when I shall mourn for thee. Where the scath'd fig-trees shade the southern wall, The Greeks pour all the battle. There his host The dreadful Agamemnon rolls, and there In furious confluence the foes unite, And threaten the fenc'd town. Stay, Hector, stay, Defend that post, while others try the field. Hect. How would the sons of Troy in arms so fam'd, And Troy's proud matrons slight the chief they praise, If he should shun the fight! My early youth Was to the hardships of the camp inur'd, And my prompt spirit burns for its renown.â But come it will, the awful destin'd day, When thou, imperial Troy, shall sink to dust! Thy honors perish, and thy glory die! And yet Andromache no sad presage, My mother's death, nor Priam's sacred head Defil'd with gore, nor all my kindred laid In bloody tragedy amidst the wreck, So wounds my spirit as the thought for thee. Methinks I see thee o'er the Argive looms Pale-bending weave the story of these wars, Thy tears fast falling on thine own sad part: Oh, Gods! and shall some haughty Greek dare say, As she deep-loaded with the flowing urn, Fill'd at th'Hyperian spring, (her slavish task,) âLook at the wife of Hector!â But be my bones inhum'd in trodden clay, Before thy captive cries shall pierce mine ear!â [He takes the Child from the Nurse. Eternal Jove, bestow on this my son Such fame in arms as thou hast giv'n to me, And make him rise the future strength of Troy: From fight returning, be his welcome still âHe far excels his father;â while apart His anxious mother feels her joy renew'd. Weep not for me, Andromache, no hand Can antedate my doom, the base and brave Have their allotted time, and no safe art Can add one atom to their number'd sands.â Hence to thy home, and with thy maidens there Ply thy domestic tasks: leave war to men: 'Tis their rude work, and most of all 'tis mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Field of Battle, the Greeks flying. Chalcas, Ulysses, Agamemnon, &amp;c. &amp;c. Chal. Think, warriors, think upon your former fame, You yet can save us if you will but turn; Flight is destruction; Hector raging comes Like sweeping flame, and vaunting of his gods Calls Jove his sire! O if your hearts retain One spark of ancient emulation, turn, Avenge yourselves, and vindicate the heavens. [Exit. Ulys. O lasting infamy! O last disgrace! Gods! what a prodigy surprises here; Fly we from Troy, from Troy's oft vanquish'd bands? Halt, cowards, halt! halt, dastards dead to shame! [Exit. Agam. Tremendous Jove, thou aid of the distrest, Was ever king like me so wretched made? Whence is thy favor to an impious foe, An atheist crew, abandon'd and unjust? At altars heap'd with smoking sacrifice, I ask'd destruction of the Trojan race: Now, God austere, far humbler is my prayer, Save but our relics from dread Hector's hand. [Exeunt. Thunder. Enter Hector and Trojans. Hect. Hear ye the voice of Jove? Success and fame Wait on our ensigns, and the flying Greeks For sculking shelter cower behind their wall; They thought on ours to raise their haughty crests, And to such ruin as their own shall sink, To heave the towers of Troy. Come, let us on; And when before yon fated ships ye fight, Fight all with fire, and blazing torches hurl, Till we have wrapt them in one general flame. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Tent of Achilles. Achilles, Ulysses, &amp;c. &amp;c. Achil. Princes, all hail! welcome, though Greeks. To me Ye come not foes, but to my heart are dearer Than all that bear the name. Patroclus haste, Fill up a larger cup with older wine, For we shall mix our souls. Of all the host Thy friend most values these, and these thy friend. Ulys. Hail to Achilles! happy are his guests, Not higher honored they, that at the board Of Agamemnon feast. But on our minds Lie heavier cares, than feasts or bowls can ease. Greece driven to the brink of fate implores Thy aid, and owns no saving arm but thine: Troy strides to vengeance, and her threatening tents Darken our wallâHark! how she shouts, and points The desolating fire against our fleet. For her the Father of the Gods declares, And rolls for her the omen. Full of Jove, See where proud Hector o'er the dead dilates, And Heaven and earth defies. O must we, Gods! To day inglorious feed the Trojan soil! Return AchillesâOh, though late, return To serve thy friends, and stop the doom of Greece! Ach. What in my soul is fix'd, my tongue proclaims, And action still confirms. Let Greece then know My rivetted resolve, nor teaze in vain. Long time, long toils I in her service bore; But barren glory now has ceas'd to charm. I sack'd twelve cities on the sea-beat coast; And twelve I burnt upon the Trojan plain, And at the haughty feet of your proud lord Laid all the spoil. All he in peace obtained. Presents to ev'ry prince were made, and theirs They still enjoy; but I alone of all Must mine restore. 'Tis I that must restore! My share, mine only can his lust appease; But let him use the woman as he may, He has her now. Never my sword again Shall be unsheath'd in any woman's cause! Ye have my answer. Ulys. Prince, divinely brave, Regard thy father's counsel, ere too late. When in his arms he prest thee at departure, Dost thou remember what his blessing was? âMy son, may Juno and Minerva crown Thy arms with strength and fame. Trust that to Heav'n: Be thy own care thy passions to subdue; Contention shun, and win by manners mild The happy honors of urbanity.â Such were his wordsâbut words, alas! despised. If thou wilt yield to Agamemnon's pray'r, Gifts worthy theeâ Ach. All gifts from him are hateful! Kings of his cast stand but as cringing slaves Before the noble mind. Not though he proffer'd All he himself possess'd, and all his grasp Could tear from others of their dearly won; With all the ceaseless golden tide that flows In Orchomenos' many-peopled bound; Not all the wealth and countless stores that lie In the magnificence of Thebes; though he Heap'd bribes on bribes, with gems out-numb'ring all The stars of heav'n, and sands on the sea-shore; Should all these offers ask again my friendship, 'Tis he that offers, and I scorn them all! Ulys. The Gods themselves, bethink thee, mortal man, Are mov'd by offerings, vows, and sacrifice. Ach. Thou hast said well; but at the tyrant's name My rage rekindles, and my soul is fir'd! Not till amidst the navy wrapt in flame The Grecian blood to crimson stain the sea; Not till the flames, by Hector's fury driven, Consume your vessels, and approach my own; Just then th'impetuous homicide shall stand Depriv'd of triumph, and depriv'd by me. [Exeunt all but Achilles and Patroclus. SCENE III. Ach. What means this grief, Patroclus? why these tears? Griev'st thou for meâor for my martial train? Or some sad tidings from our native land? Or for some meaner cause?âperhaps the fate Of yonder Greeks, doom'd in their ships to pay The forfeit of their proud imperious lord? Pat. Let Greece at length touch thy obdurate breast; For every chief that might avert the doom Lies bleeding, or lies dead. Ach. My wrongsâmy wrongs! These all my thoughts engage. Pat. Unpitying man! Oh sure thou spring'st not from a soft embrace! Thy country slighted in her last distress, Who shall from thee mercy or justice hope? No: men unborn shall curse thy stubborn mind, Thy unforgiving and relentless heart! Ach. But hear me speak!âThe wrong I grieve is past, I fix'd its period, and the hour draws nigh. Now Hector to my ships the battle drives; I see his fires, and hear the Trojans shout. Behold the thin remains of all the Greeks On the last edge of yon deserted land! It was not thus, when in the van of war I gave the battle, and saw back in heaps The proudest waves of Trojan valor roll Before my coming tempest. Now from all, The cry is Hector!âand his dreadful voice Commands the slaughter, and commissions death! But haste, Patroclus, hasten to the fight; Now save the ships, repress the rising flames; Yet heed my words, and mark thy friend's command, Who trusts to thee his honor:âwith full sweep Rage o'er the hostile crewâdrive uncontrould, But touch not HectorâHector is my prey! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The Field of Battle. Ulys. O friends! O heroes! names so fam'd, so dearâ What aids expect you, or what forts to save? Nor aid, nor fortress, your retreat can gain; There stand the Trojans, and here rolls the deep! [Exit. SCENE V. The Battle. Enter Patroclus and Soldiers. Pat. Ye soldiers, sharers of Achilles' fame, Be mindful now of your acquired renown; Proclaim by valor whom ye own for chief, And add new honors to his mighty name! Think that Achilles sees you as ye fight, And mortify the haughty lord ye save. Enter Hector. Pat. Hector, come onâand cease thy mighty threats; Vain are the hopes thy insolence conceives, To force the Greeks! Have we not hands and hearts? Long ere thy fires shall on our ships descend, Thy boasted city, and her God-built towers, Shall smoke in ruins, scattered o'er the plain. [They fight. Hec. Take that, Patroclus; and with thee lie there The hope of seeing Ilion wrapt in flames, And thy soft pleasures by her captives served. Pat. Presumptuous man, soon shalt thou lie as low; Black Fate hangs o'er thee, and thy hour draws on. The time shall come, when chased along the plain, Even thou shalt vainly call thy Gods to save; And wish, to aid thee in thy desperate flight, The wings of eagles with the horse's speed. Then shalt thou run forgetful of thy fame; I see, I see thee by Achilles fall. [Dies. Hec. Whence this prophetic bodeâand why to me? Why not as well Achilles' fate be given To Hector's sword, as Hector's fate to his? [Exit. Enter Agamemnon. Agam. What! shall I quit Patroclus, slain for me! Desert his armsâthe relics of my friend! Noârather let the cleaving earth engulph Our squadrons for a sacrifice, than Troy Shall boast the precious trophy of his corse. Uly. Fly to the fleet, this instant fly and tell The sad Achilles that his friend is slain. He too may haste to save the naked corse, The arms are Hector's, and he bears the spoil. [Exit. Agam. Who does not see that partial Jove bestows Success and glory on the Trojan cause, Whether the weak or strong assail. Secure The winged fates all pierce the hearts of Greece, Not so our shafts incessant though they shower, The winds disperse them, and they fly in vain, And on our sight confusing darkness falls. O King, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, Dispel this cloud nor sink us in despair. [Exeunt. Hector (re-enters). Hec. This day we hop'd to crown our toils, and end The dire invasion! but the Sun retires, And coming darkness from our swords rescues The trembling foe. Let us too here take aid From the refreshing nightâbut lest the Greeks Fly in the silence, sheltered by the gloom, Let numerous fires the absent Sun supply, Around the circuit of the city wall: Let all the youth as yet unfit for arms, And hoary men retreated from the field, Keep wakeful watch, and let the matrons place Lights in their windows and on all the towers, Lest in the darkness the insidious foe Assail the town defenceless by our absenceâ Suffice to-night these orders. At the dawn Be all in arms and ready for the fight, Your breast-plates doubled by courageous hearts, And with the ceaseless lightning of your swords, Consume and drive the vultures from the land. O let them not in safety from us fly, But on each back some hostile mark inflict, Some wound that long their joyless wives shall tend, And warn their children from a Trojan war!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Achilles' Tent. Ant. Patroclus is no more! by Hector slain, And plundered of his arms. Even for his corpse, The naked corpse, the furious hosts contend, And fall by mutual wounds around the dead. To Troy to drag him all the Trojans rage, Where Hector dooms him to the dogs a prey, And shows the tower where he will fix his head. Rise, son of Peleus rise, and if thou canst Rescue the threaten'd relics of thy friend. Ach. Me, Agamemnon urged to deadly hate. 'Tis past, I quit it. Yes, yes, I will meet The murderer of my friend, and if ordain'd, Give too my carcase to the Trojan curs. Yet my Patroclus linger in thy way, Soon I shall join thee, and one doom awaits The warrior and his friend, and Troy's black earth Drink up the blood of both. But ere the soil Shall with thy precious ashes be enrich'd, The head of Hector will appease thy shadeâ Yes, I will force his widow'd dame to smite With frantic hands her desolated breast, And tear the flying tresses from her head: For now again I rouse the dreadful field To reap the little glory life affords. Ho! ye that wait withinâmy arms! my arms! [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Field. Hector and Trojans. Ye men of Lycia, Dardanus, and Troy, Be mindful of yourselves, and of the fame That ye have gather'd in so many fields Of bloody harvest! With the navy's flame Let your full glory spread into the skies And brighten o'er the earth. Death is the worst, And death we all must in a little share; But for our country 'tis a bliss to die! The gallant man, though in the battle slain, That leaves his country safe, his children free, Makes his companions glory in his fate: Honors attend his high ennobled race, And late posterity resounds his praise. [Exit. SCENE III. The Tent of Agamemnon. Achilles, Agamemnon, &amp;c. Ach. O King! far better sure had been the fate Of thee, of me, of all the Grecian host, If ere the day when, mad by passion, we Contended for the luckless captive maid, Had interposing Dian pierced her heart: Long, long, shall Greece lament the woes we caused, And distant ages oft repeat the tale. But this is pastâcome let the curs'd debate By us be all forgotten! Why should I, A mortal man, with rage unquenchable Still furious burn? Here then my anger ends. Now rouse the war, and be the vengeance ours. Agam. What can the errors of my rage atone? My troops, my treasures, all that I command Are at thy will and taking. Ach. War I askâ Give me but that. Here in the time we talk Our work is slighted, and our duty suffers. Uly. Though godlike thou art by no toils oppress'd, Our feebler troops crave respite and repose; Let food again their wasted strength repair, And daring spirit flow from generous wine, Till their fierce fancies urge them to the foe: Yet a short interval, and then the war. Ach. By Hector slain, their faces to the sky, Behold our heroes grim with gaping wounds; Pale lies my friend with ghastly gashes torn. Revenge is all my soul! no meaner care Can enter in the furious furnace here. But go, ye chiefs, indulge the genial rite. Destruction be my part, and flowing blood, Riots of death and agonizing wounds! [Exit. SCENE IV. The Field. Troy in view. Achilles to his men. Ye far-fam'd myrmidons! ye fierce and brave, Think what reproaches I so long endured. âStern son of Peleus!â thus, ye cried to me, While ye lay restless raging in the shipsâ âO nurs'd with gall, why does thy stubborn ire âDefraud us of the field, nor send us home?â Such were your words, now, warriors, grieve no more, This day will give all that your rage desires. Behold the Trojans! feast your hungry swords, Glut your starv'd hearts, and let your fury thrive. [Exit. SCENE V. The Battle. Hector and Paris, &amp;c. Where is Deiphobus, where Asius gone, And OthryonÃ¦us, where are they fled? Sure fate hangs o'er thee with her blackest doom, Curse of thy race, and of the Trojan state. Par. O taunt not thus, my brother and my friend, Thy warm impatience makes thy tongue unjust. In other battles I deserved thy scorn, But not in this. The chiefs you seek are slain. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. A Room. Andromache. What sounds are these, alas! what dismal cry Invades my ear! Hark, how the people shriek! My trembling knees fail under me. My heart Flutters as if in danger. Some new woe, Some sad reverse of fate recoils on Troy! O! ye great gods, my fearful thoughts repress! What if my Hector with Achilles fight, Or chas'd along the plain, he fall, he die! [Exit. SCENE VII. The Walls. Priam on the wall. Haste, haste, ye wardens of the city gate, Set wide your portals to the flying throng. [Enter Hector.] Hec. O Gods! where lies my way? To enter here! Honor and shame th'ignoble thought cancel. Noâif I e'er return, let me return Triumphant from my country's terror slain; Or, if I perish, let her see me fall In open battle and in her defence. Priam. (from above on the wall) Ah, stay not, stay not, Hector, guardless thereâ Hector, my lov'd, my dearest, bravest son, Yet shun Achilles, enter yet the town And spare thyself, enter and save us allâ Shelter thy life, or if a soul so brave Neglect that thought, O save thy dearer fame! Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs! O miserable me! on the last brink Of helpless age to stand this spectacle, And drain the bitter dregs of fortune's cup. He comes, he comes, with unresisted sway, Achilles comes, and havoc tracks his course. [Enter Achilles.] Ach. Join battle man to man, and arms to arms. [Exit Hector. Wretch! thou hast scaped again, once more thy flight Has saved thee. But not long it shall avail If any power assist Achilles' hand. [Exit. Priam. (from above) O Hector, late thy parents' pride and joy The boast of nations, and thy country's shieldâ To whom she owed her safety and her fame, Her chief, her hero, and almost her God! O wretched Trojans, hither turn your steps, And weeping blood, behold you dismal sight, The man belov'd of heaven, your Hector fly Inglorious from the all-subduing foe. SCENE VIII. The Combat. Hector. Enough, Achilles, Troy has seen me fly, But now some God within inspires anew My soul: and bids me try, thine or my fate; Or thou or I shall fall. But on the verge Of this last battle let us pause a space, And call the heavens to arbitrate the just Conditions of our stipulated terms. Ach. Detested as thou art, nor pact nor oath, Achilles plights with thee: such pacts as wolves Make with the lambs, such leagues as lions make With men, I make with thee. To such I call The gods of heaven and hell. Eternal hate, No thought but rage, nor other truce than death. Rouse then thyself, and call up all thy heart, Collect thy soul for this decisive strife. Each Grecian ghost by thee deprived of breath, Now hovers round, rejoicing at thy doom. Hec. The life you fancied to that jav'lin given, Prince, you have miss'd. Thy life on mine depends. To thee, audacious, is unknown my doom, Or what may prove thy own: but this I know, By no ignoble wound shall Hector die! I shall not fall a fugitive. My soul Shall bravely issue, but first try my armâ A spear, O Gods! a spear! Is it so, Heaven? But in a mighty act I will expire, Let future ages hear and emulate. Ach. At length is Hector stretch'd upon the plain, Who fear'd no vengeance when he slew my friend. Then, Prince, you should have fear'd, and trembling known, Achilles absent was Achilles still. But a short space the great avenger staid, He came, and laid thee with thy glories there. Peaceful Patroclus sleeps, rescued from Troy, But thee shall birds and mangling dogs devour. Hec. By all the holy prevalence of pray'r, Achilles, leave me not to dogs a prey. The common rites of earth to earth confer, To soothe a father's and a widow's woe. Ach. Though Troy to bribe me offer all her store, Though Dardan Priam, and thy weeping dame Drain all their realms to buy thy carcase back, They shall not rob the vultures of one limb. Hec. The furies thy relentless heart have steel'd, And fill'd it with unconquerable hate, Yet think the day will come, when thou shalt pay The full atonement for the wreck of me. [Dies. Ach. Princes and leaders of the Grecian bands, The fates, the Gods, lo! to our arm have given The great destroyer, the defence of Troy; Is not already then the town our own? Haste and survey if yon deserted towers Hold yet another hero, meanwhile you, My myrmidons, in triumph bear the corpse. Lift now the harmless, once the mighty Hector, And be your song triumphant to the shore, âHector is dead, and Ilion is no more.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REMARKS ON THE TRAGEDY OF HECTOR. This little cento was, we are informed, originally composed as an exercise to show the dramatic beauties of the Iliad. It would be superfluous to offer any opinion on the merits of the dialogue; but the translation may have claims on the indulgence of the critical scholar, which few will probably be disposed to admit. For the public stage the Tragedy of Hector is obviously unfit; but as a school drama it perhaps deserves consideration, and we are acquainted with no piece to which less objection could be made by parents or masters. The shortness of it is also a recommendation to the private amateur, if his knowledge of the original is not extensive or minute, otherwise he will doubtless be offended at the liberties of transposition which the compiler has taken, and find in the second and third acts more of Pope than of Homer. We cannot dismiss this article without expressing our regret that the simple and manly topics of the great poets seem now to be altogether neglected, and the vagaries of fancy and distorted feeling substituted for those rational and vigorous compositions of judgment and genius which held the mirror up to nature.</field>
